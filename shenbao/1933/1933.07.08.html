<h3>麥唐納努力疏解結果經濟會議埀死復蘇</h3>
<p>主幹部會議决··</p>
<p>貨幣經濟兩委員會仍應照常工作</p>
<p>但用金國宣言反對參加通貨討論</p>
<p>主幹部下週一再開會</p>
<p>將另擬各組會新議程</p>
<p>（美國有附和羅斯福計劃之趨勢）</p>
<p>（提高世界物價運動悄然發展中）</p>
<p>（倫敦）經濟會議主幹部决定該會議繼續工作按此項决議案、係英相麥唐納提出、經主幹部全體通過者、內稱經濟會議之工作有儘量繼續之必要、惟各金本位國家鑒於各該國情形、不能不聲明渠等目下對於貨幣問題之一切討論、均不能參加、因此主幹部請各小組委員會、將各種問題能繼續討論而有利益者、從早開列清單、主幹部又决定彙集各小組委員會之報告書、加以整理、以便提出建議、作爲商議經濟會議以後工作之根據、主幹部定於星期一開會、以便接收各小組委員會之報告書、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）世界經濟會議因英人之調停已免於决裂、現除有關貨幣者外、悉將繼續進行、白銀本未列入貨幣計劃內、亦將由白銀小組委員會照常工作、惟各金本位國中央銀行代表仍將於星期六在巴黎集議討論匯巿劇變期內保護各該國貨幣方案、</p>
<p>按此次會議之獲救、全由於目前不討論貨幣問題之折衷辦法、照雙方商定非俟金本位國願意時、不强拉其討論貨幣事件、至其他一切問題、則金本位國將完全參加討論、惟觀於匯價之常此劇變逆料貨幣問題不久仍有提出討論之必要、麥唐納曾鄭重聲明、金本位國之宣言純屬單方面的、今後仍隨時可以提出貨幣問題至非金本位國方面亦無不能於認爲適當時期、提出貨幣問題之規定、故數代表以爲金貨幣問題、勢將列入經濟計劃之範圍內、</p>
<p>至主幹委員會决議案、係勸各委員會儘速準備其修正之新程序而從事討論冀臻同意、自經濟會議决定維持後、今日全世界巿塲皆受良好影響、證券公債咸見漲價、（六日國民電）</p>
<h3>主幹部前日集議情形</h3>
<p>赫爾運用手腕</p>
<p>脫卸破壞責任</p>
<p>（倫敦）世界經濟大會主幹部昨晨集議、如陪審員閉門會商然、晨會歷三小時、辯論大會命運、同時各國代表羣集於會議室附近、以待其决議午餐時、有主幹部委員數人赴美使署參加爲摩萊敎授餞行之宴會午後主幹部又集會、但聞此非正式集會、不過委員集此以聽取主席麥唐納之言論耳、晚間六時、主幹部重行集會、决定各委員應繼續工作、經濟大會之得免於立即與完全銷滅者、實賴美代表赫爾英代表張伯倫與加拿大代表邊納特三人之力、聞昨晨主幹部開會時、空氣甚爲緊張、處理用金國所提大會延會之議案、赫爾發言至爲動人、籲請大會繼續工作、謂各代表對於議程皮毛、尙未議及今奈何有數國代表僅因並未列入議程之貨幣穏定問題而欲辭職云、赫爾將用金國用稱彼等不能討論之議程中事件、核較一遍、此舉乃將破壞大會之責任由羅斯福總統肩上轉至用金國肩上、可謂善用其手腕矣、（七日路透電）</p>
<h3>主幹部决議案內容</h3>
<p>（倫敦）英人方面消息、今日主幹部所通過之議案、計分兩節、第一節爲叙言性質、附以用金國一方面之宣言故此非爲主幹部之决議、主幹部確信大會必須進行、雖用金國片面宣言、措詞甚爲有力、但有「目前」字樣、足見不能穏定係指暫時而言、此種字句、及用金國對於穏定需要之重視、皆爲人人注意之點、（六日路透電）</p>
<h3>美總統將進一步提訂互惠稅約</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）　頃自可靠方面聞悉、美總統羅斯福以倫敦經濟會議已能繼續進行、刻正擘劃商訂互惠關稅條約計劃、以期回復國際貿易上之平衡、觀於倫敦經濟會議中大半反對用多邊條約修改關稅、逆料美總統計劃或將以締結雙方條約爲基礎、而保留最惠國條欵云、（六日國民電）</p>
<h3>大會傾向羅斯福計劃化</h3>
<p>提高物價新運動</p>
<p>正在悄然發展中</p>
<p>（倫敦）世界經濟會議中刻有依循美總統計劃化、該會爲提高物價大會議之新運動、正在悄然發展中、設能成功、則其</p>
<p>最後結果將成立包含美國·英帝國·斯干的那維亞各國·拉丁美州·與遠東各國之大集團、而使歐陸金本位國苟不放棄金本位或重定貨幣價値、則將處於孤立之勢、（七日國民電）</p>
<h3>英國態度明顯</h3>
<p>有附和美國政策之象</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國現已愈有徐徐附和美國政策之象各自治領土之壓力、業已掃除英人加入金本位集團之可能性、今其政府領袖顯似祇待美總統膨脹通貨政策之成功更有具體表示後、即將倣行美國先例倫敦泰晤士報向來反映政府意旨、今日社論直率聲稱、英國與自治領土之政策、應趨向於美總統所抱之同一目的、此乃當今世界最急要之圖云云、可覘英人態度之變化、（七日國民電）</p>
<h3>摩萊離英返美</h3>
<p>（倫敦）摩萊敎授爲羅斯福總統關於經濟事件之親信顧問、昨晚偕其個人顧問史華浦由倫敦乘汽車赴蘇桑濮墩、而登曼哈敦號輪船前往美國、或以摩萊敎授到華盛頓後將否辭職之問題質諸史華浦、史答稱决不辭職、若干方面所傳摩萊因美總統不從其言、頗覺不懌之說、並非事實、蓋摩萊敎授並未主張穏定不過傳遞情報而已也云、（七日路透社電）</p>
<h3>美國獲精神上勝利</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）經濟會議繼續工作之决定、此間人士認爲美國之勝利、及羅斯福「堅决態度」之結果、但經濟會議目下究竟尙能進行何種工作、此間人士頗以爲疑、一般人以爲所謂勝利、純屬於精神範圍、蓋經濟會議於貨幣及關稅問題旣均不能討論、則即使繼續工作、亦不見有何顯著結果、此外美國經濟上孤立政策、已根本占勝利、白宫現時所關心者、純爲本國經濟恢復問題、至於外交事項、則非至絶對必要時决不顧及、傳聞軍縮會議、美國代表台維斯、擬遲至九月始再赴歐洲、因美政府以爲在今日情形之下討論軍縮殊覺無益也、台維斯、前曾以羅斯福個人</p>
<p>特使資格、在歐活動、現國際趨勢旣已變動、故台氏即再以特使資格前往歐洲、亦屬無益、大約台氏對此項任務、或將辭謝云、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>堂堂大會祗留軀壳</h3>
<p>（倫敦）用金國集團目前已破敗、而眞正之局勢依然未變、用金國旣不願參與貨幣事務之討論、則大會之貨幣方面、顯不能爲任何實在有益之工作加以討論、如稅則與津貼金等事之重要經濟股員會、因用金國堅主非先商妥穏定幣價、而從事討論此項問題、殊屬無益、故亦不能辦公、今唯一可能之工作、厥爲如白銀木料酒糖等物品之討論、　意不出數日、堂堂之世界經濟大會、所餘者恐唯一空殼而已、（六日路透社電）</p>
<h3>羅斯福將致力內政</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）美國資本有漸增多之象、故羅斯福總統决定美國今後力避與聞國際事務而專致力於內政、則其經濟之復原可更迅速、聞美國已退出廢除出入口禁令之國際公約、此次美國堅决不同意於穏定幣價、亦爲羅斯福總統决計自循其途徑之一證也、（六日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）振興經濟事務處主任强森將軍、擬向羅斯福總統提出一種棉業管理章程、其中主要各欵、爲實行每星期四十小時工作制度、南方各城棉織工廠工資每日最少十二美元、北方至少十三元、並禁止雇用未成年之工人、按此項章程、係空前之舉原文極長、當費多日時間從事研究云至最後時間、强森突然打消立即提出之意、謂羅斯福總統當先研究他種問題、但所謂他種問題究指何事、則略而不言、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>投機賭風遍及全美</h3>
<p>（紐約）據紐約太陽報消息、證劵投機之賭風、現遍及於美國、在內地設有支店　之經紀人接其調查員報告、據謂證劵與物品商行所接之委託單、較一九二九年交易極盛之年爲多、芝加哥各業經紀人皆極活動、南主棉花交易亦甚旺、紐約證劵交易所方面之貸入、六月份增百分之四七、達七八○·三八六·○○○元、此爲一九三一年十月以後之最高數、（六日路透電）</p>
<h3>各委員會開會</h3>
<p>分别討論工作進行範圍</p>
<p>貨幣治標組</p>
<p>法財長代表用金國</p>
<p>主張討論限於債務</p>
<p>（倫敦）貨幣委員會治標小組委員會開會、主席宣稱、本委員會繼續工作、乃吾人在目前一致之願望、議程現有數項問題、有待於討論即、㈠新放欵、㈡匯兌漲落之限制、㈢債務、㈣資本流通之恢復、㈤本委員會應否繼續工作等問題是也、英國代表財長張伯倫宣稱、此項問題可全盤討論、法國及羅馬尼亞代表則以爲討論問題、應以債務問題爲限、巴西代表提議將各問題全數提出討論、但分爲兩股員會、其一包含用金本位各國、其一包含「貨幣自由」各國分别討論、法國財長龐萊則於會議中答復英國財相張伯倫、歷述各國代表團態度改變之經過、謂貨幣休戰如不能實行、則全盤問題均無從審議云、龐萊切實聲明、渠洞悉美國種種困難、故對於羅斯福總統之變更態度、並不加以批評、又謂經濟會議貨幣委員會旣設立治標小組委員會、可見經濟會議對於此種問題之解决、實認爲必不可少、目前若干友邦代表團若欲作新試騐、自無不可、但不能强令其他代表團改變態度且「將穏定貨幣問題擱置不談、實與經濟會議目的背道而馳此層麥唐納首相固已愷切言之矣、」龐氏繼又說明經濟委員會之各小組委員會必須繼續進行討論、最後謂「法國代表團深願經濟會議克底於成、其所採取之立塲、即所以保證經濟會議之成功故無論如何、决不加以以變」云云綜上觀之、貨幣委員會繼續工作事件、最後决定究屬如何、尙不可知、但金本位國立塲業已表明、此項决定或不能完全徇金本位國之意、亦屬可能也、一般人相信如貨幣委員會决定繼續工作、則用金本位各國或將考慮僅指派觀察員列席、至於巴西代表所提議主張分設金本位國與「貨幣自由」國兩股員會分别討論、則未必能通過云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>經濟委員會</h3>
<p>產銷組决定仍繼續工作</p>
<p>商務組得限制討論範圍</p>
<p>木料股員會延會至十月</p>
<p>（倫敦）經濟委員會今晨亦開秘密會議一小時、一致决定將通盤調節生產與間接保護主義兩問題照常進行、嗣商務政策與津貼航業兩小組委員會、亦分别開會討論其工作內可以繼續進行之範圍商務政策小組委員會開會後、法代表亦即動議解散、爭稱目前形勢下不能討論關稅及比額問題意代表繼之、力爲金本位國張目、英商相任錫曼出而相抗正式提議委員會繼續工作、美代表麥克麥諸慈·日代表石井·與阿根廷代表裴科均竭力擁護英國主張、雙方唇槍舌劍、爭論久之、卒乃决定繼續工作、推舉起草委員草擬今後工作之新綱領、據某代表語記者該委員會內反對繼續工作之勢力甚大故必須審愼考慮議程內何者仍可討論、大致在最近將來、討論範圍將限於最惠國條欵·取消比額·及關稅與貿易限制等項津貼航業小組委員會開會後、雖以法意代表之堅决反對、仍决定繼續工作、但當隨商務政策小組委員會爲進退、並採用日代表提議將此種情形建議於主幹委員會云、（七日國民電）</p>
<p>木料股員會今日亦决定暫停討論至十月、惟酒股員會幾已完成其工作、今晨决定積極宣傳反對酒禁之主張（七日路透電）</p>
<h3>撤廢限制輸出入公約日本無退出意</h3>
<p>將另行講求對抗策</p>
<p>（東京）　一九二七年成立之取消禁止輸出入及限制之國際條約、五日美國曾通告退出、又英國早已退出該約、故結果參加者、僅日本荷蘭瑞典與芬蘭等四國而已并因此减低該約之效力、惟日外務當局因英美兩大國之退出、係使經濟帝國主義爲表面上故甚重視之、然日本於此際當無退出該約之態度、而其方針將另行講求對抗策、（七日電通社電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>不容忽視之新疆局面　梓</h3>
<p>新疆自四月十二日發生政變。金樹仁被迫出走以後。迄今將及三月。在六月初旬以前新興首領。雖互爭地位。各不相下但尙皆表示服從中央。紛電請派大員前往。似乎中央大員一到。糾紛不難立解。局勢不難平定者。及黃慕松以參謀次長奉使前往宣慰。於六月中旬抵迪化。回部之馬仲英。首先不服制止。逞兵進犯省城。今馬仲英之事甫解决。而省城內部。又生問題。陶明樾爲前次倒金時最有力之人物。陳中曾於政變後奉派赴莫斯科。固與劉文龍盛世才同派者也。乃近日電訊傳來。陶陳與李笑天同以謀改組省政府故。爲劉盛所槍斃。宣慰使黃慕松且有被監視之說。此不特足以揭露新疆新興首領間互相軋鑠之情形。且可使吾人了解彼等之所謂服從中央矣</p>
<p>新疆之事。非單純之省內事件。在鄰省間。則寗夏靑海之首領。與馬仲英同屬回部。不無相助之意在西北擁有特殊勢力之魯大昌。因與金樹仁爲同鄕。頗欲助金恢復勢力。就外力言。則喀什之馬紹武與英接近。在南路稱雄。伊犂之張培元爲親俄派。亦擁有勢力。四月政變之時。劉盛外因回軍進攻之勢。內藉陶明樾部駐扼省城各要地。乘金之不備以起事。得以成功。此後各方一因劉盛之敷衍。一因待中央特派大員爲公平之處置得能暫維舊狀。故其間除馬仲英外。皆無舉動。此次事件省城之內。自相傾軋中央大員。不能自由行使職權。而謂不致引起省外各方之糾紛。恐非事理之所許也。</p>
<p>新疆有一百六十四萬平方公里之土地。在全國各行政區域中。爲第一大省。其面積。江浙之僅爲十萬平方公里者。固不能相比即大省如四川（四十萬平方公里。）亦只及其四分之一。今此巨大之地域中。方因政治失其統制。醞釀重大之變化。前途艱難。言之可懼。吾國人其將何以督促政府。迅爲有效之措置。以免於東北淪陷以後。更見西北之不堪局面乎。</p>
<h3>僵局中之中東路交涉</h3>
<p>日本又進行斡旋</p>
<p>（東京）中東路買賣交涉、早因所有權問題已成僵局、大橋「滿洲國」代表昨赴外務省、訪東鄕歐美局長恊議下次會商日期之結果、內定待蘇俄接到回訓、開一度正式會議、以後即由私人會商、下次會</p>
<p>議大約在十一日、如屆時仍難妥恊、交涉前途無打開希望時、則假八月中避暑之名、暫時休會而於其間力謀雙方空氣之和緩、（七日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京（蘇俄對於中東路讓渡交涉之前途謂日方提案於今後之交涉難免無迂𢌞曲折、但結果當可解决、故今無再向莫斯科請示必要而擬依向來方針進行云、又下次會議約在十一日、八月亦不休息、有意繼續會議、（七日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）「滿洲國」外次大橋代表今日下</p>
<p>午四時赴外務省、訪問東鄕歐美局長對於收買中東路交涉、傳達「滿洲國」方面如下之意見後、對於今後之對策曾爲種種之懇談、收買價格依然主張五千萬日金决不讓步、俄滿關係若如今之對立於理論的、雖開私的會談依然不濟、故「滿洲國」不主張私的會談、下次會議現待蘇俄之提議、如是則下次會議蘇俄若不積極的設法展開局面、勢將陷於停頓狀態、（七日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）外間盛傳俄滿買賣中東路之談判因雙方意見歧異行將决裂、或謂、日滿政界之某方面主張以積極計畫對付中東路之爭端以免淪於破裂、惟據外務省發言人今日聲稱該會議結果如何、尙難逆料、蓋今方在初步階段也、又謂日本遇必要時將居間調解、而使獲和平解决、希望雙方可於下星期初續開會議云、（七日路透電）</p>

<h3>唯用武力能將日本逐出滿洲</h3>
<p>對美日形勢亦不樂觀</p>
<p>主張造艦對付黷武主義</p>
<p>美承認蘇俄促成遠東均勢</p>
<p>舊金山美國史克利伯何懷德系各報兼聯合新聞社總董何懷德視察遠東後、業於今日歸抵此間、向舊金山新聞記者發表其所得遠東時局印象云、日本已在遠東造成一亞爾薩斯勞萊、（按亞爾薩斯勞萊兩省向爲法德間爭執地、普法之戰割與德國、今又歸法、歐州大戰、此兩省亦爲一原因、）唯用武力始能使日本退出滿洲、並謂彼之所言全係根據與中日領袖談話所得之印象、中國人民皆完全深知欲令日人退出滿洲所應有之問題、中國領袖咸謂、目前大工作在造成達到此項目的所必要之威力、若輩皆知欲收復滿洲、已不能向國聯獲得助力、唯有練成足以擊敗日本之軍隊、</p>
<p>何氏對日美間形勢亦不樂觀、謂對日本一國美政治家必須三思而後行、太平洋未來和平、胥繫於若輩之遠大目光、前此日美兩國間未嘗有較少齟齬根原之時期、即在目前兩國關係上猶有某種嚴重性、惟此種現象由於不同的心理所造成者居多、而出於基本原則之衝突者較少、苟能遇有問題發生時、出以坦白直接與友誼的交換意見、則易於獲得較深之諒解、前此時時造成緊張局勢之事件、皆由缺乏諒解、甚致柄政者間亦缺乏諒解所致、日本永不能瞭解美國排斥東方人之眞動機、渠信美國宜撤廢排斥法律、規定一移民歲額、樹立增加互尊心之始基、　　何氏又主張立造新艦、達到倫敦條約限度藉以消除美國專講和平之觀念而爲對於意外事件之保險、因自光淺短之黷武主義者、將促成意外事件也、</p>
<p>何氏又信美國承認蘇俄、當可使遠東有較善之均勢、且或可爲美國趨向於承認業已成立而能行使職權的政府、不復過分注重其產生的情形之新政策之第一步云、（六日國民電）</p>

<p>比賽已有八載悠久之歷史、惟每年參加單位、僅及全數之半、推其原因、大半由於各區經費不足所致、因由華西代表提議、下列補救辦法、以冀各區踴躍參加、符全國分區之名實、自下屆起（民國二十三年）籌備比賽區（主區）、負有籌募津貼參加各區旅費之責任、其數目交請全國體恊會酌各區間旅費之多寡、分别規定之、</p>

<h3>談談擴聲器</h3>
<p>— 一知</p>
<p>欲收音機發出宏亮的聲音清晰的音調，則機內各部的設計選擇和配製，均須得當。擴聲器亦爲其重要的一部。假如一具收音機，各部配製都很講究，但忽略了擴聲器的選擇而用一具不適當的，就難使收音滿意。擴聲器有需强電力工作的，有僅需小電力工作的，因其結構的不同，各有其特性，優點，用途。現在且來簡單的介紹一下，以備參考。　　擴聲器可分三種··㈠固定綫圈式（Fixed　coil　type）或稱磁石式（Magne　tictyoe）；㈡活動綫圈式（Magneticpe）或稱電動式（Dynamic　type）；㈢靜電式（Electrostatic　type）或稱電容式（Condenser　type）。今將三種簡單原理，</p>
<p>構造，特性，優點，用途，分列叙述。㈠因定綫圈式</p>
<p>擴聲器放聲的原理，就是利用音波電流的强弱，使磁石的磁力發生變化，將薄膜（Diphram)一吸一放，在空氣中振動激成音浪。牠簡單的構造原理如圖一；Ｍ爲永久磁石（或稱母磁石），Ｍ爲小磁石，（牠的磁力全靠母磁石供給的）</p>
<p>C爲音流綫圈，Ａ爲薄膜。當外來的音波電流，經过音流圈時，磁石即起吸力變化將振膜Ａ一吸一放，來復振動激成音浪。這種擴聲器，依其結構，又可分</p>
<p>爲三種；㈠雙極擴聲器㈡平衡銜擴聲器㈢平衡膜擴聲器</p>
<p>㈠雙枉擴聲器（Double　pole　loudspeaher)</p>
<p>這種擴聲器，是磁石式的最簡單者，聽筒，以及有一類的管形喇叭(Hornloudspeaker）即依此原理而製造的，牠的構造如圖一。其優點；㈠構造簡單，價格低廉㈡收音靈敏㈢費電甚小。其缺點；㈠因振膜與磁石間的空氣隙甚小，若負載稍大電流，會將振膜吸住發出雜音，如若將振膜與磁石間的距離放大，則對於弱音不起動作，㈡往來振幅不等，易發生倍週率噪音。至其用途··因需要電力微小，用於小民力的眞空管收音機上，甚爲適合，在往昔强力眞空管未發明前，這種擴聲器，曾稱覇一時，現在則除聽筒仍風行外，管形喇叭已日被淘汰。</p>
<p>（二）平衡銜擴聲器，Balanced　armature　loudspeaker)平衡銜擴聲器，是改除雙格式的缺點而構造。如圖二與圖三··Ｍ爲母磁石·Ｅ·Ｆ·Ｇ·Ｈ爲小磁石，Ａ爲平衡銜，Ｃ爲音流線，Ｄ爲振膜，當外來音波電流自Ｓ處流入，Ｙ處流出則Ｇ·Ｆ·兩磁塲的磁力加强，Ｇ·Ｈ·兩磁塲的磁力减少·將平衡銜順着時針的方向吸動·但瞬息音波電流起交換變化，由Ｙ處流入，Ｘ處流出，則Ｅ·Ｈ·兩磁塲强度加增·Ｇ·Ｆ·兩磁塲强度低减，平衡銜遂被反着時針方向吸動。這樣來回振動，一秒間起了數千次的變化，在空氣中遂成音浪，這種擴聲器，能改除雙極式的缺點，故較雙極式的爲優。其特點㈠平衡銜常保持其平衡位置，故來回振幅常等；㈡磁塲不易飽和·負載電流常可以稍大㈢不會起倍週波率雜音。其用途··適用於三管以上的眞空管收音機上，能發出清晰，宏亮，動聽的聲調，不如雙極式的糢糊難聽，（未完）</p>
<h3>關於裝置收音機的幾個注意點</h3>
<p>— 朱天賦</p>
<p>裝置收音機，是隨便什麽人，都能按照線路圖，而配置起來。而且人人都知道，收音機的另件，是要擇品質優良的，但若對於內部的排列，和接線，不加注意，則於收音機的選擇性，靈敏性</p>
<p>，及音量的高低，清濁，會發生不良的影響。</p>
<p>關於排列方面的··</p>
<p>配諧電容器（Eurning　Condenser)，不可與任何線圈接近，且勿置在一直線上，否則配諧不銳，選擇性减低，　　高週率部份的線圈，决不可和低週率部份之變壓器，或扼制圈並放在一直線上，或並行，宜成眞角放置。（照余試騐之結果，以成八十四五度時角爲最佳）。否則收得之音，非常嘈雜。</p>
<p>再生圈的位置，不宜與天線線圈相近，且以近燈絲方面爲佳，有减少雜音的效果。</p>
<p>如爲交流電收音機，則其整流部份的裝置，應與收音部份隔離，否則必發生交流聲（Ｈum）3</p>
<p>高週率放大眞空管，要用金屬罩隔離，因爲四周綫圈內所產生的磁力，能經过眞空管，由感應而變成雜音。</p>
<p>關於接綫方面的；</p>
<p>各部的接綫，宜直綫進行，愈短愈妙。在短波尤宜注意，接綫處一定要用錫銲固，否則接點堆積灰　，右則傳電不好，或則漏電。</p>
<p>所用的　藥，不可用含用酸性的物質，否則銲接處日久會被腐爛。</p>
<p>交流燈絲的接綫，不可有長短，並宜用絞合綫，可减少雜音及交流聲。</p>
<p>兩綫（高週率接綫與低週率接綫）不宜平行，即不能如此，亦須距離稍遠。（最少二糎）</p>
<p>接綫最好用有色綫以區别之，如屏路（Plate　Circuit）接紅綫，栅路(GridCircujt）接藍線，以便檢查修理。</p>
<h3>怎樣在電壓分位器上求適當的電壓</h3>
<p>— 明襄</p>
<p>一隻收音機裏，所用的眞空管，式號不完全相同；即使用相同的眞空管，而擔任的工作，往往也有區别。所以各個眞空管的屏極或簾栅極所需要的電壓，均不一致，各有適當的數　。在直流電收音機，這種不同的電位，可在Ｂ電池上求得，固極容易，且各點電壓，無論收音機的工作情形如何，始終不會變更。惟交流收音機，屏極及簾栅極的電壓，係用整流管輸出的直流電壓供給的，其數值之大小，利用電壓分位器（Ｖoltage　Divider)上各點不同的電壓降。因電壓降與流經之電流有關，所以分位器上各點的電壓數値，不能固定，須視收音機內眞空管所引用電流之大小而定，如圖所示，係簡單的收音機整流部份，ＡＢ兩點間的電壓最高，設爲三百弗打，今若以一萬五千歐姆的電阻Ｒ接在ＡＢ兩點間，以作電壓分位器，如欲求某適當電壓値的一點，必先知自該點流去的電流爲若干（此數値即眞空管的屏流或簾栅電流），再加以分位器Ｒ原有的電流，以這和數除所降落的電壓，得數就是某點與Ａ點間有的電阻値，例如在圖示的分位器上，欲求一百八十弗打的一點Ｃ，自該點流去的電流爲二十千分安培；分位器Ｒ原有的電流，依歐姆定律應爲３００÷１５０</p>
<p>００＝０·０２安培。ＡＣ間的電流爲此二電流的和數四十千分安培，ＡＣ間的電位降爲３００－１８０＝１２０伏脫，所以ＡＣ間的電阻應爲１２０÷０·０４＝３０００歐姆。</p>
<p>用此法求出的Ｃ點電壓，還不十分準確，因爲自Ｃ點引去電流後，ＣＢ間的電流，不能仍爲二十千分安培，因此，Ｃ點的電壓，高於一百八十弗打，所</p>
<p>以Ｃ點應略向下移動，增高ＡＣ間的電阻，以求最準確的電壓。</p>
<h3>診話</h3>
<p>— 企堯</p>
<p>一電子所荷之負電量，約爲一庫倫之六兆兆兆分之一，其微小可驚。</p>
<p>第一號軟銅線長一千呎，約有耗阻一歐姆。</p>
<p>人體耗阻，視皮膚之乾操或潮濕而定，普通情形，約在三千歐姆左右。倘有十分之一安培電流經过人體，即有生命危險。</p>
<p>最精細最複雜的無線電收音機內部各種機件所用的銅線，假使把他拉直，恐怕比我們中國所有的鐵路哩數還要長哩。</p>

<h3>節省個變壓器</h3>
<p>— 張國泉</p>
<p>在上海法租界所用電壓一一０弗打的收音機，倘要移到華界成英租界，電壓在二二０弗打之地方去用·那末非要化錢去購置一個　　０／２２０弗打變壓器不可，但現在有個很經濟的方法，就是用一只一一０弗打，約</p>
<p>四０瓦特電燈泡，（視收音機瓦特大小而定）接在電燈線一端，就可應用了。（如圖）但是二二０弗打的收音機要改爲一一０弗打，就不可照此辦法，須買變壓器方可應用。</p>
<h3>不同電壓改接簡法　梁少雨</h3>
<p>巿間出售之電源變壓器，（電源方棚），其初級綫頭常有三個，以備用者換接不同電壓，因上海華界與公共租界均係二百二十磅，獨法租界則爲一百十磅，若有人欲將機由法租界移至華界與公共租界或遷回舊地，必須將初級接綫處改接，此種手續非常麻煩，時間又不經濟，設家中未備銲接工具者更甚矣，茲有一法頗簡單，祇須向無線電材料行購一只單刀雙投開關（俗名石刀開關），依照下圖接好，則遇遷移時，戕開關投接於適合電壓上則妥矣，便利非凡，不妨一試。</p>

<h3>論頭</h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>說起頭，它是最觸　頭的東西。人體上不論口或手或某部爲了要洩什麽　等　下了滔天大福，結果頭總受不白之冤。此種事，報紙上數見不鮮，想大家都能心領神會的。所謂受不白之寃，說得文雅些，呌做「處極刑」；俚俗些，卽是「殺頭」！顆是吃飯傢伙。頭而被殺，自然連飯都没得吃了。你想可惜不可惜。古人定出殺頭的刑罰，眞是巧妙得很。金聖歎臨刑時，曾說；「殺頭至痛也，不圖　歎於無意得之。」這句話，至今有人當爲豪語的；然而被聖歎瞞過了。何以呢？誰不痛惜自已的頭顧？聖歎自也不能例外。「殺頭至痛」，換句話說，就是「此後連飯都没得吃了，非常可惜。」且殺頭，誰是有意得之？故聖歎的話，總覺有些予盾。還有，像「好頭顧誰來砍之」等的話頭，也都是哄哄人的。你若信之，又要受驅了。</p>
<p>有一首論殺頭的歪詩，似頗有至理；我現在把它錄在下面，請大家看看··</p>
<p>聞道頭堪殺，人人怕殺頭？有頭皆可殺，無殺不成頭。殺已由他殺，頭難是我頭。除非殺頭者，誰願殺其頭？</p>
<p>頭顱的價値，以今比古，在相懸殊了。從前有抱頭當作進見之禮的。荊刺秦王，没有樊於期的頭便不行。這是一個有力的證據。現在呢，天開殺機。外患患不清，剿匪匪不盡。頭顱的價値，比西瓜都不如了。你如果有錢的話，大可到外國去走走，讓這吃飯傢伙，吃些大菜，嘗嘗異味，也算不虛此一生。不然，卽使你連飯都没得吃，一圙不小心，或者連這傢伙，也要搬塲，亦未可知。</p>
<p>販了些洋八股進來，口頭想賣賣野人頭，或者筆頭想出出風頭，這原是吃飯的一種手段。然而誰能原諒，就有「無意得之」的危機啊。</p>
<h3>寂寞夜奏曲</h3>
<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>身體浸入三萬六千頃的太湖裏，月色流水般，從牕檽裏瀉進，舖在花磚上，和微微灔瀲的湖波一樣。挾着輕寒的風，又辛苦地吹，月色似乎也起了隠約的縐紋。我，就是沉溺在這樣一個白琉璃結成的世界中，覺得冷，覺得幽靜。好偈這油一般的月光，灌入了心，照亮了心上凝凍的血，那麽紅！</p>
<p>酣睡在牕外月色裏的一角建築物的倒影，如惡魔聳着黑翼，俯瞰着我的房門，儼如太湖邊上的峯巒，在恐嚇凉天的孤雁，雲都給驚散了；但我就如一個失侣的飛雁！</p>
<p>淡淡的心情，像一盃白水，没有香，没有味，没有色，也没有熱；安靜地躺着，那是將涸的死水，只期待早一點乾枯！</p>
<p>再不能想到飛逝了的靑春，坐在沙發椅裏，算是我的墳墓。萬一月光變成墓碑，請把凉天的雁影寫在上面吧！這　獨的雁，它會告訴你單單是一個「人」字　　是子夜了，一點聲音都無，眼前祇飄渺着死的游塊。不是樹影，不是山影，不是旁的東西的影，太糢糊了，那連一</p>
<p>個「人」字都飛去，飛得没有痕跡了。</p>
<p>然而我彷彿聽到了鄰家傳來的琴聲，那樣清，那樣緜曼，那樣憂　，好像是在說；</p>
<p>·「從前有個女人，她送我以純白的絲巾，</p>
<p>以屍體一投下，就立刻不見，這樣，算是昇天。</p>
<p>金葬，是用於貧民的。它的手續，人死後也用喇嘛唸經，唸好了經，就將屍體抬　野外　行　　　　　　　　　　　樹葉兒一大堆·舉火焚燒·以招鳥來，再由葬手用快刀將屍體連皮帶骨的砍成無數小塊，（約　豆大。）復件以靑稞粉，然後把他統統齋鳥·以屍體被鳥兒吃完的快慢·定死者生前的善惡，最好是當天吃完，如果做幾天吃完，那末以爲這是死者生前爲人不好，和死後受罪很重的徵象，於是家人必須再用喇嘛替他超度。</p>
<p>那邊的鳥，是吃慣死人肉的，所以它們一見行葬人所燒常綠樹葉兒的烟氣，便知道濃烟起處，又有食吃了於是各處的鳥兒，都爭先恐後的飛集攏來，它們來了之後，如果屍體還未好吃，那末都環着屍體而停於地上候着到葬手反砍碎的屍肉撒在地上，他們便很歡喜似的啄食。至於鳥兒的種顃，却各種都有，可是以鴉和鵰爲最多，那邊的鴉鵰，比中國任何地方的來得高大，而且膽子也大，常常接近人身，有時人們用手在他們身上撫摸，他們也並不驚逃，這是人們永不加害他們的原故。</p>
<p>金葬的稱謂，因屍體須經過刀砍，而刀是金屬鑄的，故名。又以葬亦稱爲鳥葬，因爲屍體用以餵鳥之故。（按蒙古是行鳥葬的。但蒙古的鳥葬。是人死後掛於樹上。恣鳥啄食。以肉盡爲升天）　　西藏地方，每個城巿裏，和材落裏，都有水葬和金葬的指定地點各一二處，</p>

<p>— 葉奕顧</p>
<p>將來有許多的投稿者，他所生出來的孩子們，都是臘袋空心的；這個原因，就是因爲孩子門的爸爸，從前都把臘汁絞乾啦！</p>
<p>將來有許多學校，都採取留聲機和無線電來敎授學生們的功課。敎員自然是不請了，而管理敎室秩序的，也許就是丘八。這樣，我倒爲中國喜，因爲從此敎育呆以普及了！</p>
<p>將來的人，也許比現在做人還要難；不詐寫文章，嘴唇封鎖；呼吸空氣的自由也要限制。</p>
<p>將來的大學，其內部組織，定亦有大大的改革；改革的步驟是這樣；將圖書館改作咖啡館，將運動塲改作跳舞塲，將博物院改作電影院，將研究院改作按摩院。</p>
<p>將來的女人，也許出會回復到原始時代；因爲伊們的衣衫，由長袖而變短袖，由短袖而變無袖，而變背心，而變赤膊，而變裸體。</p>
<p>將來的學校毛厠裏，會特設性學講座。</p>
<p>將來的中國，也許就是在四川。因爲四川形勢險要，人家攻不進，自已可以相打。</p>

<p>這一晚上，除了聽戲而外，所有大部分的時間，都是在討論馬旅長。散戲的時候，他們走出戲館子的大門，恰好那位馬旅長也帶了新太太，由裏面出來，在大門口，又是不期而遇。那馬太太向黃曼英道；密斯黃，剛才怎麽不到包廂裏來坐坐？我有許多話要和你說呢。黃曼英道；剛才我陪着客呢，不便到你包廂裏去。改天我到你公館裏去看你，可以的嗎？那位馬旅長，就代表太太答話了，笑着點頭道；可以的，可以的。歡迎得很。黃曼英還要說什麽，出戲館子裏的人一陣擁擠，就把大家分開來了。回到了黃家，曼英送着他娘兒倆回房來安歇。桂枝又笑了，他道；剛才那位馬旅長，人倒是挺和氣，還呌黃小姐到他家裏去坐呢。黃曼英道；一個旅長，那算什麽？不過一個人總看自己的機會罷了。田連長的同班同學，現在當師長，當軍長，當總指揮的全有。桂枝聽了這話，不免有些納悶，他有那些個闊同學，怎麽還是在當連長？曼英和江氏，坐在靠壁的椅子上，桂枝是坐着靠了床欄干，正好和曼英對面。他且不望着曼英，却偏過臉來向江氏道？田連長他們，不都是同學嗎？這個他們，桂枝是暗暗的己經把趙自强，也包含在內了。曼英笑道；不是那樣的。趙連長聽說是敎導隊出身，田連長原是學生，考取了軍官學校以後，就編到軍隊裏去當兵。江氏情不自禁的喲了一聲道；田連長還是當大兵升上來的啦。曼英道；可不是？現在做軍官的，總是要由大兵一步一步上升着去的了。當了大兵，才可以當排長連長，當了連長營長，才可以當團長旅長。想一步跳上去，那是不行的。（一二三）</p>

<p>友人簡復盛君，湖南人，清末時曾在西藏充當軍官有年，光復後回家，現寓吾鄕，嘗以西藏的奇聞異事見告，現在我轉紀一二如下··</p>
<p>藏人死後的殯葬，分水葬和金葬二種，凡是上等人和喇嘛死了，是用水葬的。水葬的手續，人一氣絶，便立刻去請八個或十二喇嘛來唸經，約唸二小時，便將屍體用木板抬到水邊去行葬，旣到了目的地，便把死人身上的衣服統統剥下，背縛一塊大約二尺長四寸闊二寸厚的生鐵，然後把屍體投下水去。凡投屍的河裏或溪裏，那水勢是很湍急的，所但是都在野外。至於葬手，乃是一種職業，猶之我們這裏的材夫，凡是人家死了人，非要去請敎他們不可，而且各有各的地段，如果甲到乙的地段去做生意，那乙必和甲交涉，這就是像我們這裏同業中一人犯了行規，而全體同業和他理論一樣。</p>

<p>自由談屠格湼夫的臨終  郁達夫│爲屠氏逝世五十週年紀念作│　　以一八一八年十月二十八正午生下來的屠格湼夫，從數字錯列的玩意兒中試卜起來，他自己以爲一八八一年的十月一日，是他的死期。但到了一八八一年的年終，他的健康，却絲毫也没有損壞。在這一年裏，他並且還和愛人維耶度夫人Mme　Viardot把他自己著作「勝利者之歌」譯成法文，寫了一篇「不怕死的人。」　　一八八二年春，雖則他遇着了許多不幸的事情，如愛女的逃回，瘋痛的發作等，但健康還是如常，直到二月底邊，忽而急症襲來，從這一年的三月上床以後，一直到翌年的九月三日午後辭世爲止，他眞受盡了肉體上的千千萬萬的苦痛。　在苦痛的中間，他屢次要求自殺，以减輕他的痛楚，甚至向來看他病的莫巴桑乞求一枝手槍，請維耶度夫人將他的身體從窗裏抛擲出去。　　托爾斯泰聽到了他的病訊，有很懇切的信來慰問，他在病床上，用鉛筆親自寫了一封覆函，是他的最後的一道書簡。他自覺到了死的將臨，自己是完了，疲竭了，勸托爾斯泰再好好的重復去幹些文學的工作。　　一八八三年正月，他因囊腫而試手術之時，竟不用局部麻醉的注射，而想親自來體騐一次受手術時的劇痛的狀態。事後他對來看他的都德說；「我親嘗一嘗這痛味，而發見一種晨適當的表現手法，來寫出這些感覺與心狀。角剖刀割入肉去，眞有點兒像利刃切香蕉。』　　臨死前半月的有一天晚上，他呌維耶度夫人到床邊去，央求她爲他筆記一篇短篇，寫的是一位俄國貴族的裔孫，墮落成爲偷馬竊賊的故事。這故事名呌『結末』，是他的著作的末一篇，也是暗示着俄國貴族階級的終了没落的東西。　　一八八三年八月末日，是禮拜五，露易莎走入了他的病房。昏睡之餘，他似乎還辨認得出這是露易莎，因而呌着說··　　『露易莎！眞眞奇怪，我的腿怎麽會掛在那兒角落裏的呢？房間裏并且塞滿了棺材。可是，他們還許我有三天好活。』九月二日，禮拜天，他又清醒了一回，說了些只有保靈維耶特夫人能懂的話。九月三日，禮拜一的午後二時，他便氣絶了。　一九三三七月從「文人」說到「瘋狗」  田磊　　讀了日前本談發表的「談文人無行」一文，使我發生無限的感觸。我覺得文人之無行，並不是個人問題，而是當前敎育與文化上的嚴重問題，因爲如像上文所引述的種種醜行，恰爲顯示我國敎育之破產，與文化上嚴重的病態。　　比如，曾某能作「序的解放，」能打起他人的招牌爲自已捧塲，能删改他人的信作爲「好評一束，」這樣「妙想天開，」我們究竟不能不承認他是有幾分「聰明」明；有幾分「天才。」可惜的是他有此聰明與天才而衆人莫之知，社會莫之用，於是他的天才與聰明便終於只能之用於作「序的解放」與「好評一束」以及「打打雀將」等等的勾當。所以使天才湮没固然是社會之過，而使天才亂用，社會亦正不能辭其咎。　　同樣的，如張××君，他本在日本學地質學，然而他學了地質學回國，却不得其用，只好模仿日本的菊池寬，專門從事於三角纞愛小說的製作，一部，兩部，····塊固定的模型，總是那樣的製下去，數年來毫無改變，而文字的惡劣，尤每况愈下，粗製濫造，純以Ｍake　Mone,爲目的，甚至有人說他是「三角纞愛小說商。」以一個學地質學的人而只能從事於描寫性愛以迎合一般意志未定的靑年的低級趣味，騙取靑年們袋子裏的錢，這固然一方面是由於作者自己不長進，而另一方面這混亂的社會亦自不得不負若干責任。　　即如他之善於造謠，善於放冷箭，雖卑鄙可憎，伹究竟亦即所以顯示其「聰明」，所謂「其爲人也小有才」。一個有才的人而社會不能利用其才，當然他只有自由的發揮。比各一隻兇猛的狗，我們不能用之搜索禽獸，不能用之看守門戶，當然。惟有逢人便　，逢物便咬，因爲　的本能終於是不能不發揮。　　不過他最近旣在各種小報上鼓簧　舌，呶呶不休，日前又在某報上登載啓事，含沙射影，對人橫肆誣蔑，其所爲我認爲似乎已超出「本能」之外，這簡直是一一種瘋狂的行爲，一種毫無理性的行爲，如果以狗爲例，他便正好比是一隻「瘋狗」。│然而他究意確實在日本受過高等敎育，「瘋狗」之稱，似乎未免有辱「斯文」，那末，我們就說他是「瘋人」罷！　　對於一個「瘋人」，我們只有可憐　的分兒，眞的，誰能和瘋人談「有行」與「無行」呢？對牛彈琴，他那裏　得！他那裏懂得！　　編者附言；昨天看見張某的啟事，盛怒之下，立刻寫了一篇啟事回答。今早一覺醒來，展聞報紙，看到自己的啟事，倒深悔多事，不該和這種人回嘴。張某如再對我造謠誣衊，决計置之不理，聽他去儘量暴露他自己的人格好了。惟本刋今後對於少數文壇敗類，當仍繼續予以痛擊，爲中國新文藝界做一點點除穢的工作。虛榮  周楞伽　　藢悶懨恹的坐在宿舍窗前，眼望着窗外晦暗的天空，心裏充滿了無限的懊惱。　　這懊惱，壓到她心上來，己不是一兩天的事；自從她進了這所最高學府以來，她的心，便完全被懊惱盤據住了。　　人們似乎都具有一種愛美的天性，於是，稍微有一些姿色的女性，便無形的成爲衆矢之的，到處都有一班男性追逐趨奉，希冀達到他們求愛的目的。而且，這些男性，又慣會揣　女性的心理，滿足她們的慾望。比方，在這學校裏，就流行着一種皇后的名稱。每個到這里來求學的女性，不論驰的學識怎樣，只要她有着十足的姿色，她便會接受到這皇后的稱銜。受着全校同學的尊敬。　　薇不幸具有着秀麗的姿色，於是，這一個皇后的稱銜，就很輕巧的蓮到她身上來了。　　這便成爲薇煩惱的主因。雖然她並不反對人們這樣稱她，而且她的虛榮心更使她因這稱銜感到驕傲和快樂。她所懊惱的還是在怎樣使這))ueen的尊稱名副其實。　　薇的家境是不很寬裕的，她的父親不過是個小商人，爲了要使她受高等敎育已很費了一番心血，當然更　力供給　的衣食費用。而在薇，這又　是不能缺少的，一個受着全校尊敬的皇后而没有一些相當的衣飾做陪櫬，這是多麽可恥的事呀！　　於是，薇的心，便深深的沉入懊惱裏了。　　約摸是在一星期前，有一天下香，薇正在校園內散步，忽然，在她後面，隠約傳來了男性的笑語聲。　　「平，你看，這就是我們的皇后。」　　「眞的嗎？怎麽她的衣服穿得這樣樸素？」　　薇本能地低下頭，臉上火辣辣的紅熱起來。她連散步的心緒都没有了，急忙奔回她自己的宿舍裏去。羞憤的感情充滿在她意識裏，整個下午她的心都得不着寗貼。她覺得；如若再没有一些衣飾來裝扮自己，實在愧對這一個皇后的稱銜了。　　而最使董感覺嫉妒的，是宿舍裏的幾個女同學，幾乎隔不了多天，便要抱一包衣料到房裏來。什麽華爾紗哪，喬其紗哪，那些鮮艶奪目的花色不時在她眼前閃耀，再加上她們那彷彿有意驕傲她的吃吃的笑聲，更使她增加了不少羞愧。　　同時還有使薇恐慌的事；學校裏不久就要舉行游藝會了，同學們早在那裏預備衣飾，而她，居有皇后之稱姿色冠於全校的她，身上却依舊是一件洋布旗袍，更没有旁的服飾。相形之下，便已顯出　的　村，何况同學會還在推舉她擔任一個重要的節目呢！　　在無可奈何中，薇只有寫信到家裏去要求。實在，除了這，她更没有第二條路可走了。　　可是現在回信來了，信裏所給予薇的只有一個失望。父親只絮絮陳述他的苦况。並没有給她一些滿足。的確，在這重重剥削下的小商人，處境是很困難的，薇也不忍再去迫促他。　　於是便只有讓懊惱繼續來呑　她的心，她悶　　的坐在窗前，望着窗外那晦暗的天色，精神上更覺得異樣的苦悶。　　無意地薇從桌屉內抽出了一封信，那粗而有力的字跡合她一望而知是一個男同學寫給她的。關於這人的身世，薇也約略聽得一些，知道他是一個僑商的兒子，家裏很是富有。這使她在初接着信時心上頗有些搖動。但她不願卽刻降格去俯就他，所以一直把他的信擱着。現在無意翻了出來，却使她心裏猛然得着一個計較。她覺得，要維持自己皇后的榮譽，並使一切人都贊美她，只有暫時把一些無用的道德的觀念放棄，答覆他這封信。　　薇毫不遲疑的提起筆來，寫了一封復信給他，可是心裏的懊惱却更深刻了，慾望和理智交戰着，躁汗如雨一樣的從她額上落下，濕透了整張的紙。紙上到處都充滿着墨汚，甚至連她自己也不知道寫的是什麽。創作小說平凡的事（五）  澹果孫　　在那個素來名呌「奚家宅」而現在被帝國主義者因爲示威故意喊做「格利格拉脫路」的西頭，我們從朝　之下，可以明顯地望見馬路兩傍那兩道釘親鐵欄杆的百脚矮牆裡面的樹叢裡，疎疎落落露出許多欵式不同色采不一的洋式高樓。馬路是没有車輛的，矮樹是脫盡了華子的，高樓是閉好窗子的；一切寂靜得像是正都在長眠之中。使我們疑惑天上的灰色大幕，是專爲這整個的大規模的摩登殯儀館而設的。偶爾望見一合没有裝鐵板的鐵栅欄門裏面，有一兩個身批大　的彪形大漢正逗着幾籠百靈鳥兒頑，又可以使我們明白栅欄或欄杆的動得的和動不得的一切，都有利己式的常川戒備的設施，在這冷靜的地方逍遙他們的歲月。　　忽然，鳴鳴鳴地一陣警號聲從南面傳過來了，隨着又有一陣沙沙沙的摩擦聲從附近的柏油路上擠到空氣中間了。格利格拉脫路上的幾個酷愛和平的行人，都不免由本能的作用，抬頭向着那些聲音的來處一望；一輛空的汽車由橫馬路的南端向東拐灣過來了。牠繼續發出鳴鳴的警號走了十多秒鐘，就在路南一合像是應着警號爲牠打開的鐵栅欄門跟前，又拐了一灣就進去了。這就是伯唐當天早上派了去接之光誰料竟撲空而回的車子。　　原來伯唐昨天在送了雍孫出門之後，把接濟这說仔細推敲了一回，接着就用電話去問幾家很熟的同行，曉得其中有兩三家也接到了同樣的通告。　　『這究竟是少數了！』伯唐摸着腦袋向那幾個陪着他推敲的親友說，『這樣一個大題目，何以工人只要我們幾個少數的人做文章？……何以工人只要我們幾個少數的人做文章？』　　『剛才所說的那兩三家』，伯唐的一個姓施的表兄問，『規模是不是和長興的相似』　　『大概都不相上下，我們都算是在頭等廠家之列」。　　『那末，怎樣就算是頭等？要有多少的本錢』？　　『本錢嗎，誰都不知道誰，所以內行决不僅在本錢上面分等第，因爲內行所注重的是生意的做云』。　　『做法？這就不是我們外行可以明白了』！　　『這也未必盡然，簡單點說，譬如運送材料，我們這幾家不僅全用自己的卡車，並且有時候·還拿卡車租給别家用，像這樣做法，像設備上的這樣做法，都不是二等廠家辦得到的。』　　『那末，長興的卡車現在都放在那裏？』　　『都寄在霞飛路的卡車行裏。』　　老施聽了這句話很發了一會的獃，後來才說；　　『我最初就想到他們的目的在乎卡車，現在旣然卡車有了這樣妥當的地方，他們就是跑了來要求，我想至多你也不過是多費一番唇舌；凡事總得兩邊願意，怎好勉强！』　　伯唐含著苦笑點了點頭，他的妻子，何佩萸却揚著手說；　　『卡車固然是有了妥當的地方，可是各種重要的村料，都堆在大南門的廠裏……』　　『啊都堆在大南門的廠裏！……』老施照樣念了一遍。　　『你說「怎好勉强」，施五哥，」佩萸說，』我想眞要廠裏的工人不來勉强才好，旣然重要的材料都在那個地方！』　　『那末，』老施帶了發抖的聲音說，『我看連之光都不必呌他先到大南門去，爽性呌他先到這裡，一面商量辦法，一面等候工人的代表。這樣就可以免得……免得……另外生些枝節………』</p>

<p>談言裸體運動的經濟觀  賓符　　裸體運動的呼聲，已從香港傳播到了上海，在上海，也許不久就有廣範圍的裸體運動實現，也許那熙熙攘攘地擠滿南京路上四馬路上的男女老少將盡是一絲不掛的『模特兒。』　　在『駸駸進步』的今日中國社會，陳舊『倫理』的餐衣早已卸去了，而中華民族又是天生的愛好藝術的民族，這富有藝術價値的裸體運動，禁不得男女的藝術靑年的一聲呐喊，是一定會普遍收獲成功的。但是，從經濟的立場說，如果裸體運動一旦實現了而且普遍地實現了的話，我却要爲洋布店綢缎店的股東老板以及上下夥計呌屈了。　　記得十九世紀後期的時候，英國有名傳敎士斯丹雷Ｈenry　Morton　Stanely曾在曼徹斯德的商會中作這樣的演說；『我們如能把歐洲文化和基督敎義傳入剛果，使野蠻的赤裸裸剛果土人都知道以衣蔽體，那末，單就他們一個星期日所穿的衣服計算，我們曼徹斯德的棉布就可多三萬萬二千萬碼的銷路；如果土人們能每天穿起衣來，那末，我們每年就可以多二千六百萬英鎊的收入了。』反之，如果今日的我們「藝術靑年」把外國人的裸體藝術搬到了上海，單就每人只有一套衣服的我們上海的幾百萬的文明人，因了赤身裸體而省下來的衣服計算一下，已就可觀，何况上海的摩登女郎小姐以及達官貴人大都有着幾襲其至幾百千襲的漂亮衣裳啊，上海所有的洋布店綢緞店還不統統關起門來幹什麽？　　附帶的，如果裸體運動普遍的實行了，電影院中專門以「色相」「肉感」爲號召的歌舞團，將要消滅了，因爲大地中儘是着裸體的女郎，歌舞團再也不能以「奇貨可居」的「肉感」來招徠了，電影院所計畫的「肉感經濟」也就没落了。　　我不忍想像裸體運動實行以後的危險，悲慘的失業羣裏更要增加了洋布店綢緞店的夥計；滔滔的黃浦江中將更多自殺的靑年；我也不忍想像裸體運動實行以後的滑稽，長蛇般的電車中擁擠着的赤條條的男女；門可羅雀的洋布店櫃上打着盹的幾尊「裸满。」　　可不是麽？前幾天洋布綢緞業的領袖已向當局提出「查禁裸體運動」的呈文了，表面理由雖然是「倫理」的，誰敢說他的動機不一定是經濟的呢！登龍術的登龍術  不登龍　　英國有一痊鼎鼎大名的數學家的哲學家，提起他的大名即使在中國曉得的也很多。他就是羅素。我們中國現在却出了一位數學家的文學家，或者更切實的說，數學家改行的文學家。他的大名我却記不清楚，約略知道他一度受過東洋敎育的洗禮罷了。看你奈何我！停戰恊定　　他忽然高興，不編他拿手好戲的算學敎科書，却偏偏撰了一部呌做什麽洋洋數萬言的「××做狗術。」他出版的法術是只賣預約不賣單行本。預約的書價是甲種大洋一元以五百本爲限，乙種大洋八角以一千本爲限。如其一齊預約賣脫的話，這部「××做狗術」總共可得大洋一千三百元。眞是一筆好生意經。　　我虛度到這個年紀，中西書籍，│不吹牛│，看了無千大萬，却笑話得很，不曾買過一次預約。這並不是不相信預約，不過因爲我愛看那一部書，我歡　喜立刻就去買來，此所謂先覩爲快，書價貴賤窮措大倒滿不在乎。　　那末那部只賣預約不賣單行的「××做狗術」撞着只買單行不買預約的我怎樣會做成賣買呢？不瞞諸公說這是我一時迷信幽默太過的原故。那部「做狗術」的廣告最早是登在「倫語」上的，第一次的廣告却没有宣布那部書的作者尊姓大名，因此我疑心那部書一定是「論語」派中人做的，書中一定有許多幽默的地方，因此我就買了一部生平破題兒第一遭的預約書。　　那部「」××做狗術一次展期之後居然出版了。那部書印刷裝訂倒還古雅，可是內容就糟糕。銅洋鉛角，零拆碗菜，垃圾舊貨拉雜一起，膚淺平淡，外加幾名似乎俏皮而其實不俏不皮的話，眞可謂無聊已極，只能給鄕下土老兒賞識。這或者是登龍術的登龍術吧。店員通訊編輯先生；　　你是我們迷途中的指導者；現在我有一件很難解决的事情，請敎先生，諒不會拒絶的吧！事情是這樣的；因爲我家境困難的緣故，所以在小學畢業後，不得不向這黑暗而險惡的社會裏來解决我的生活問題。後來承鄰友的介紹，一爿五金店裏來做學徒！前月間店中發生二次缺少銀錢的事情，不知怎樣，他們的嫌疑，卻會集中在我個人身上。雖然没有眞憑實據，他們不能難爲我；但是冷言熱譏，實在使我有點受不了；並且</p>

<h3>Luandong Puppet Troops Main Force Has Left The Railway Line</h3>
<p>Scattered Units Still Stationed In Various Locations, Not Yet Withdrawn</p>
<p>Three Representatives Depart From Dalian, Return To Tianjin</p>
<p>(Beiping) The main force of the Luandong puppet troops has left the railway line, but scattered units are still stationed in various locations and have not yet withdrawn. The Beining Railway is expected to have direct access to Shanhaiguan within days. The three representatives, Xue, Lei, and Yin, who went to Dalian, departed from Dalian this morning due to the substantial completion of the meeting, and are expected to arrive in Tianjin tomorrow morning. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Regarding the rumors in Pingfang that the recovery of lost territories in the war zone would begin on the 10th, the provincial government has no knowledge of it. According to Yu Xuezhong, although the Dalian meeting was successful, there are still minor issues, and it is feared that the recovery period will be at the earliest around the 10th, pending the Tanggu meeting.</p>
<p>(7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Ping martial law command has ended. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shunyi reports that at approximately 1:00 PM on the 6th, 19 Han bandits sent from Miyun arrived at Yanggezhuang Town north of the county, claiming to take over the second district of the county. They declared that the Japanese army would arrive soon, and their attitude was extremely arrogant. The district head and branch director reported to the county government, which is currently seeking instructions on how to deal with the situation. It is currently unknown whether the Japanese army has arrived there. Tongzhou reports that Sanhe, Jixian, and other places are peaceful. The Yutian county magistrate has not yet returned to his post. The public security chief brought section chiefs and staff from Tongxian to Yutian to return to their posts. Lushi reports that the Luandong and Ninghe puppet troops have not yet withdrawn and there is no significant activity. The area has been peaceful recently. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Here, the results of the Dalian meeting are generally not satisfactory. Although both Chinese and foreign parties are willing to restore railway traffic to its original state, the Chinese side is still dissatisfied with the solution to the "puppet troops." The reason given is that the Japanese side has already pressured China to reorganize the puppet troops that endanger the peace of Luandong and Anning into security teams, ordering them to maintain the security of the Luandong area. Furthermore, these 5,000 puppet troops are allowed to use their own firearms, so Japan can freely increase or decrease the number of these troops, and the management power over Luandong is further consolidated. (7th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The puppet troops in Santunying fear there are dangerous items, and are excavating everything.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Seeks Loans From Britain</h3>
<p>(London) Next Monday, when the House of Commons convenes, Conservative MP Lee Mock will ask Chancellor Chamberlain whether he knows that Chinese Finance Minister Song Ziwen is currently negotiating a large loan with well-known London banks, possibly for purchasing goods abroad? Will the Chancellor approve the issuance of this loan with the condition that goods must be purchased in Britain? (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tombs nearby were excavated. Yesterday, the tombs of Ming Mucheng and Xue Yan Niang were discovered to have been excavated. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Although the Japanese army is gradually withdrawing from the Luandong area, they still leave some soldiers in each place. Therefore, China cannot officially take over even one of the 18 counties occupied by the Japanese army. It is heard that the Chinese representatives who went to Dalian will return to Ping tomorrow to report everything, so the Japanese army can withdraw from the Luandong area as soon as possible, and it can be taken over by China. (7th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Swedish Prince To Visit China</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to reliable sources, Prince Carl of Sweden is scheduled to visit China on the 25th of this month, intending to visit scenic spots in Hangzhou. It is heard that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to receive him with state guest honors for three days to show Sino-Swedish friendship.

<h3>Dagu Three Ships Act Freely, Zeng Yiding Has Gone To Tianjin To Investigate</h3>
<p>One theory is that the three ships were ordered to concentrate in Qingdao.</p>
<p>Shen Honglie's circular telegram encourages all Northeast Navy personnel to unite sincerely.</p>
<p>Han Fuju and the entire provincial committee telegraph the central government to retain Shen.</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zeng Yiding came to Ping to meet with Qia Donghe to discuss the issue of the Northern Navy's reorganization under the central government. A general agreement was reached. Zeng returned to Nanjing to report to the Naval Department, and then the central government will issue a clear order for implementation. Zeng left Ping this morning for Tianjin to investigate the unauthorized departure of the three ships, Chu Yu, Yong Xiang, and Hai Ou, which were anchored at the Dagu port, and will return to Nanjing to report. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the three ships, Hai Qi, etc., fled to Guangdong, it was rumored yesterday that the three ships stationed at the Dagu port, Yong Xiang, Chu Yu, and Hai Ou, again acted freely, sailing away from the Dagu port yesterday morning. According to investigations with relevant parties, the three ships were ordered to concentrate in Qingdao. Because the central government approved Shen Honglie's resignation as fleet commander, the fleet will now be directly under the central government and directly commanded by the Ping Military Branch. Therefore, they were first ordered to sail back to Qingdao to concentrate. It is still unknown how the ships themselves will respond. If handled properly, there should be no further problems. It is heard that Shen's intention to resign as mayor of Qingdao remains firm, but it is inconvenient to leave as Qingdao is about to hold the North China Games. He intends to resign and reside in Ping after the games conclude. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) Weihai, Yantai, Zhucheng, Jimo, Rizhao, and other places have successively sent telegrams to retain Mr. Shen. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) On the 6th, Shen Honglie sent a circular telegram to all personnel of the Northeast Navy, encouraging them to unite sincerely, serve with peace of mind, not harm public interests for private feelings, not forget the country for individual reasons, and to be diligent and self-respecting, so that they may be worthy of being good generals when advancing and good citizens when retiring. On the 6th, the captains of various Northeast Navy ships telegraphed Jiang, Wang, He, and Huang, detailing the circumstances of the defection of the three ships and declaring that the defection of a few cannot represent the entire navy. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han and the entire Provincial Committee, the Provincial Government Secretary-General, and the High Court President telegraphed Lin, Jiang, Wang, and Huang, saying: "Since the Liaoshen Incident occurred, Qingdao has been in a special situation, amidst shocks. Mayor Shen has been consolidating the military and administration, sitting calmly in office. Not only are merchants and people supportive, but even foreigners express their deep admiration. Such a shield for the East Sea should not be lightly changed. Understanding is anticipated. Qing and Lu are as close as lips and teeth, and dare not remain silent. We respectfully request a clear order to retain him, in order to solidify the overall situation in North China. We await orders urgently." (7th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Truth About Hao Peng's Arrest</h3>
<p>Rewarded by his subordinates for greed</p>
<p>Engineered his capture and delivery to the military headquarters</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to Yu Xuezhong, the traitor Hao Peng pocketed the money alone, and his partisans resentment deepened. A few days ago, Yuan and Li entrusted someone to express to Yu that they would deliver Hao to the military headquarters and could receive a certain amount of reward money. Yu feared it was a trick, so he casually responded. Unexpectedly, at 5:00 AM on the 6th, Li, Yuan, and two others indeed used a car to deliver Hao to the military headquarters. Yu still suspected that they were impersonating someone to claim the reward. Later, it was determined that it was not a false claim, which was truly beyond Yu's expectations. According to Hao's confession, his actions were to save the country, not to sell it. The cessation of the Japanese army's attack on Pingjin and the disbandment of the Tianjin plainclothes team were all the result of his advice to the Japanese side. According to Yuan, Hao lived on Mingshi Street, with five attendants. More than ten Japanese soldiers were stationed next door to protect Hao. On the night of the 5th, three attendants were lured to Sheng Deli to solicit prostitutes, and the other two attendants agreed to capture Hao. At 4:00 AM on the 6th, one attendant sneaked into the room and stole Hao's pistol from under his pillow. Another attendant opened the street door, and two accomplices got out of the car, stuffed cotton into Hao's mouth, and dragged him into the car, driving to the military headquarters. The Japanese consul in Tianjin, Tanaka, protested to Yu at 10:00 AM on the 6th about the arrest of a person across the border. Yu told him that military and political agencies had not sent anyone to arrest Hao, and that it was indeed Hao's subordinates who had defected to claim the reward. On the morning of the 7th, the Japanese military police captain, Major Morimoto, came to visit, but Yu refused to meet him, and he left angrily. How to deal with Hao is being awaited the Beijing's instructions. After another interrogation, he was shot in Tianjin. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chen Jitang Intends To Recruit Three Ships</p>
<h3>First Telegraphed The Central Government To Request Instructions On How To Proceed Before Making A Final Decision</h3>
<p>The captains of the three ships called on Chen to request recruitment, otherwise they would sail elsewhere.</p>
<p>Chen Jitang convened generals to discuss, and the defense was extremely strict.</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The acting commander of the three fugitive ships, Jiang Xiyuan, the captain of the Hai Qi ship, Ran Baiqing, and the captain of the Hai Chen ship, Guan Zuanxi, accompanied by Fang Nianzu, traveled by car from Hong Kong to the province on the morning of the 7th. They arrived at noon and first went to the Navy Club, where Zhang Zhiying led them to call on Chen Jitang to request recruitment. Chen Jitang immediately convened Yu Hanmou, Xiang Hanping, Miao Peinan, and others to hold a meeting. The defense was extremely strict. By 3:00 PM, the meeting had not yet ended. It is heard that it has been decided to recruit them, but it has not yet been decided whether they will be directly under the Guangdong Fleet Command or the First Army Headquarters. After the reorganization of the three ships, the monthly salary will be about 80,000 yuan. Further information: Wang and Jiang both telegraphed Chen Jitang, advising him not to accommodate the three ships. He Yingqin also telegraphed Chen Jitang to investigate the whereabouts of the three ships. Therefore, Chen Jitang is still considering the recruitment matter. He first telegraphed the central government to request instructions on how to proceed before making a final decision. The three ships are currently docked in Chiwan, led by Yang Chaolun, the captain of the Zhaohe ship. If Guangdong fails to recruit them, they will sail elsewhere. Jiang Xiyuan said in Hong Kong that although the reasons for opposing Shen are complex, dissatisfaction with Shen personally is the main reason. Shen's trust in personnel is not exclusive, he is not sincere to people, and recently he suspected that Northeast officials harbored different ambitions, which led to this change. The three ships' soldiers and officers have decided to join Guangdong and will definitely not return north. This time, the Zhaohe lacked coal, and was towed by the Haiqi. They encountered wind north of Taiwan and almost sank, so they were late in arriving in Guangdong. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) The Guangdong provincial leaders held a meeting this morning to consider how to deal with the three rebel ships currently docked at the mouth of the Pearl River. According to Chinese sources, the three ships have put forward conditions for surrendering to the Southwest. However, the naval authorities deny that negotiations have been opened with the three ships, saying that the Southwest does not want to receive the three ships. The three-year naval program is still in progress and two cruisers have been purchased from Britain. (7th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Zhang and Qin Rivers Are Flooding, And The Dikes Are In Danger</h3>
<p>(Zhengzhou) The Zhang River flooded, overflowing the dikes between Ni Xin Zhuang and Dong Cao Village, flowing south with dangerous waves, for about half a day. With the efforts of the Water Conservancy Bureau, the new dikes were fortunately not breached. The Qin River also overflowed, the water level rising four feet and three inches, and the situation is extremely dangerous. (7th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan resolved:</p>
<h3>Appoint Zhang Qun As Chairman Of The Hubei Provincial Government</h3>
<p>Specially Appoint Liu Xiang As Commander-In-Chief Of Bandit Suppression In Sichuan</p>
<p>All Armies In Sichuan Are Under His Command To Cooperate In Suppressing Bandits</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan held its 115th meeting on the 7th, attended by Wang Zhaoming, Chen Gongbo, Shi Qingyang, Chen Shuren, Wang Shijie, Chen Shaokuan, Liu Ruiheng, Zhu Jiahua, Gu Mengyu, and Luo Wengan. Those present were Gan Naiguang, Guo Chuntao, Yu Feipeng, and Peng Xuepei. Chairman Wang Zhaoming presided over and the following matters were explored: 1. Resolved: Specially appointed Liu Xiang as commander-in-chief of bandit suppression in Sichuan. 2. Resolved: Approved the resignation of Xia Douyin, member of the Hubei Provincial Government and Chairman, due to illness. Appointed Zhang Qun as member of the Hubei Provincial Government and Chairman.</p>
<p>3. The President proposed that, due to the rampant bandits in Sichuan, the government should issue a clear order that all armies in Sichuan should be under the command of Liu Xiang, the commander-in-chief of bandit suppression in Sichuan, and must unite all generals to cooperate in suppressing bandits. They must not engage in personal feuds that would lead to internal strife. Where the army goes, they must also pay attention to alleviating the suffering of the common people. A draft order was prepared and requested for public deliberation. The resolution was passed. (7th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government issued an order on the 7th, saying: "Bandits are rampant in Sichuan, and Tongnan has fallen into enemy hands. They must be suppressed to stabilize the region. Liu Xiang is hereby specially appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in Sichuan. All armies in Sichuan are under his command. He is ordered to unite all generals, working together to fulfill the heavenly duty of eliminating violence and ensuring the safety of the people. All past grievances and minor disputes should be forgotten. Do not indulge in personal feuds that would lead to internal strife, causing the bandit forces to grow stronger. It is also necessary to clarify discipline. Wherever the army goes, pay attention to alleviating the suffering of the common people, so that the bandit troubles can be resolved as soon as possible and the civil administration and finances can be put back on track. This order is issued with high expectations." (7th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) During a temporary meeting held by the Executive Yuan on the morning of the 7th, a Liaoning man named Xu Qinong suddenly arrived at the Yuan with a large leather bag full of books on the history of Japanese aggression against China, seeking to see President Wang. Wang, due to being busy with meetings, sent an official named Wei to see him instead. When asked about his intentions, he replied that he wanted to publicize the anti-Japanese national salvation movement and requested help with subsidies. Wei politely refused and he left. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Situation In Chahar Is At A Stalemate</h3>
<p>All Parties Are Watching Yan's Attitude</p>
<p>The Military Commission Was Established In Zhangjiakou</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Chahar situation is still at a stalemate. The North China authorities are currently pursuing new avenues without a solution, and will make a final effort. Deng Zhexi and Li Qi are still staying in Tianjin and have no intention of going to Zhangjiakou. Jin Yan's attitude is closely watched by all parties. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Liu Guitang has indeed attached himself to Feng. The army commanders of the Liu's department have long been in Zhangjiakou participating in military meetings. Feng designated Guyuan and Dolun as Liu's defense areas. He previously occupied Kangbao and Baochang. After Ji Hongchang became the commander-in-chief of the northern route, Liu ceded the two counties, and Ji sent troops to garrison them. Zhang Renjie's army under Fang's command moved from Xuanhua to Zhangjiakou in the middle of last month. Bao Gang's army also withdrew from the county seat of Yuxian and went to Datong to be reorganized by Yan. The city of Yuxian has been taken over by Feng Zhanhai's army, an army of righteousness. The various armies of righteousness, Deng Wen, Li Zhongyi, Li Haiqing, and Fu Chun, numbering more than 15,000, have been attached to Feng and have been transferred near Zhangjiakou. They are now in place. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Feng appointed Liu Guitang as the commander-in-chief of the Sixth Route. Liu took office in Guyuan on the 1st of this month and issued a circular telegram. At the same time, he concentrated his troops in the northwest of Baochang and approached Ji for discussions. Deng Wen convened a meeting with Liu Guitang, Li Haiqing, and others in Baochang on the 1st and decided to advance towards Dolun. There are more than 30 Japanese soldiers inside Dolun City. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) People from Zhangjiakou say that the direct line generals of Feng plan to establish the First Army, Ji Hongchang, the Second Army, Tong Lin, and the Third Army, Gao Shuxun in the near future. Each unit is composed of two regiments of the training regiment of a certain army stationed in Zhangjiakou, two battalions of the provincial government guard regiment, and a mixed group of local bandits and new recruits from Wanquan, Huai'an, Zhuolu, and Zhangjiakou, totaling about 6,000 people. There are not enough guns. Zhang Lisheng's self-defense army plans to be reorganized into three divisions and one detachment. Yu Yuling, Zhang Zizhong, and Cao Kai will be appointed as division commanders, and Jiao Zhong will be the detachment commander. The number of people is about 2,000 or more, including the Zhangbei west region militia of the Koubei Business Protection Regiment, and the police security teams of the four counties of Zhangkangshang, as well as the bandits of Xiao Tian Wang Ying and others, who have also been recruited. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A military commission has been established in Zhangjiakou, with Feng as chairman and Fang and 30 others as members. After the May 26th Incident, transportation in various places became inconvenient, tax revenues dried up, and the Chahar Provincial Treasury was in short supply. At the end of May, counties were forced to allocate funds to subsidize military expenses, with first-class counties contributing 30,000 yuan, second-class counties 20,000 yuan, and third-class counties 15,000 yuan, to be delivered within one week. Recently, orders have been issued to various counties to raise funds for grain and fodder, with first-class counties contributing 40,000 yuan, second-class counties 30,000 yuan, and third-class counties 25,000 yuan. Longguan, Hao Cheng, and Yanqing contributed 20,000 yuan. Grain and fodder bureaus were established in various counties, with the county magistrate as the director and a special commissioner appointed by Feng's headquarters as the deputy director. The Ping绥 Railway workers' inspection team is under the command of the Resist Aggression and Save the Nation Congress. The Resist Aggression Congress previously discussed setting up branches in various counties and sending people to Xuanhua to organize, but it was unsuccessful, and the plan was shelved.

<h3>He Yingqin Talks About The Political Situation</h3>
<p>Li Jichun's Title Is Still Undecided</p>
<p>The Chahar Situation Still Follows The Principle Of Peace</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin told reporters that the details of the Dalian consultation on how to deal with the puppet army have not yet been received. The three committee members, Yin Tong, etc., telegraphed that the three committee members have already departed from Dalian and are returning to Ping today. It will be known only after they return to Ping. However, the number of puppet troops reorganized into security police is definitely not as large as reported. Only the best elements will be selected for reorganization. Our side insists that the number should not exceed 3,000. As for the command and military salaries after the reorganization, the Hebei provincial government will be responsible for handling them in the future. Li Jichun's title is also undecided. The central government has decided to proceed with the Chahar situation through peaceful means, hoping that Feng will realize this and cancel the title of Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army, so that the Chahar situation can be resolved as soon as possible. It is rumored that the central government sent Kong Xiangxi north to mediate, but I have not received Kong's telegram to come north. The claim that the central government sent him to mediate the Chahar situation is also untrue. After the three ships, Haiqi, etc., left Qingdao, the central government is persuading the officers of the three ships to return to the team quickly. As for Shen Honglie, the commander of the Northeast Navy, he has been approved to resign. The various fleets of the Northeast Navy will be under the jurisdiction of the Central Naval Department in the future, avoiding becoming an abnormality again and contributing to unification. The incident of Hao Peng, the leader of the Tianjin plainclothes team, being arrested and sent to the First Army Department by his subordinates due to internal discord, has only been seen in the newspapers. I have not yet received a report from the Hebei provincial government. It is heard that Hao is a nationalist and it will be clear after the Hebei provincial military, political, and police authorities investigate how he caused trouble in Tianjin. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Palace Museum Holds A Board Meeting</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Palace Museum Board meeting is scheduled to be convened in Beijing on the 15th. It is heard that the matters to be discussed include: 1. Temporary and partial opening methods; 2. The current status of the cultural relics relocated to the south; 3. The future disposition of all cultural relics. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain Mr. Xiong from the Palace Museum Office said that a board meeting was held when the cultural relics were relocated to the south. Recently, due to issues such as disposal and storage, the Executive Yuan convened a board meeting to discuss everything. The meeting place is in the Executive Yuan. The members of the board include Jiang Zhongzheng, Wang Jingwei, Hu Hanmin, Dai Jitao, Zhang Xueliang, Feng Yuxiang, and more than 30 others. It is feared that a small number of members will not be able to attend this time. Yi Peiji is currently in Shanghai and can come to Beijing before the meeting. The cost of transporting the relics south is less than 100,000 yuan. The porters were hired by the Ping Municipality and other agencies in Ping, by the Jinpu Railway Bureau in Beijing, and by the Central Bank in Shanghai. Therefore, all major expenses are forwarded by various places. The cultural relics are currently stored in two locations in Shanghai, all wrapped in oiled paper to prevent moisture. Each door has two locks, one kept by the Executive Yuan and one by the Museum. Cultural relics in Ping are still on display, but because prohibited items have been avoided, ticket sales are not high. The implication is that Yi Peiji has no defects. (7th Dispatch)</p>

However, Cai has officially denied previous rumors in Shanghai and Guangdong that the independent division would be reorganized and that Mao would serve as the deputy commander. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xiamen) Deng Shizeng went to Tan on the morning of the 7th, and then transferred to Longyan to visit Cai to report on his experience in Guangdong. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japan Will Protest Again Against China's Revised Tariff</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) On May 22, the National Government announced that it would impose high tariffs on exports from Japan. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs ordered Ambassador Arima to protest to the National Government. The National Government superficially agreed to reconsider. Recently, in order to implement the tariff rate, the revised tariff rate was submitted to the Legislative Yuan. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs ordered Ambassador Arima to submit a letter of protest again. (7th Den-Tsu Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanchang) The Gan River water level rose from 17 feet 5 inches to 18 feet 6 inches on the morning of the 7th due to continuous rain. The low-lying areas of the city were flooded by a foot of water. The railway track of the Tujiapu section of the Nansun Road was submerged.

<h3>Macdonald's Efforts To Resolve The Outcome Of The Economic Conference Is Dead And Resurrected</h3>
<p>The Main Cadre Conference Decided...</p>
<p>The Currency And Economic Committees Should Continue To Work As Usual</p>
<p>But Use The Gold Standard National Declaration To Oppose Participating In Currency Discussions</p>
<p>The Main Cadre Will Meet Again Next Monday</p>
<p>Will Develop A New Agenda For Each Group Meeting</p>
<p>(The United States Has A Tendency To Support Roosevelt's Plan)</p>
<p>(The Movement To Raise World Prices Is Quietly Developing)</p>
<p>(London) The main cadres of the Economic Conference decided that the conference should continue to work. According to the resolution, British Prime Minister Macdonald proposed it and was passed by all the main cadres. It stated that it is necessary to continue the work of the Economic Conference as much as possible. However, the countries with the gold standard cannot help but declare that they cannot participate in any discussions on currency issues at the moment due to the circumstances of those countries. Therefore, the main cadres asked the subcommittee to make a list of various issues that can be continued to be discussed and have benefits as soon as possible. The main cadres also decided to collect the reports of the subcommittees and organize them in order to make suggestions as a basis for discussing the work after the Economic Conference. The main cadres are scheduled to meet on Monday to receive the reports of the subcommittees. (6th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The World Economic Conference has been saved from breakdown thanks to British mediation. Now, except for those related to currency, all will continue. Silver has not been included in the currency plan and the Silver Subcommittee will continue to work as usual. However, representatives of central banks from gold standard countries will still meet in Paris on Saturday to discuss plans to protect their currencies during periods of exchange rate turbulence.</p>
<p>The salvation of this conference is entirely due to the compromise of not discussing currency issues at the moment. According to the agreement reached by both parties, they will not forcibly drag them to discuss currency matters until the gold standard countries are willing. As for all other issues, the gold standard countries will fully participate in the discussion. However, given the frequent and drastic changes in exchange rates, it is expected that the currency issue will still need to be brought up for discussion soon. Macdonald solemnly stated that the declaration of the gold standard countries is purely unilateral, and the currency issue can still be raised at any time in the future. There are no regulations stipulating that the non-gold standard countries cannot raise the currency issue at any time they deem appropriate. Therefore, some representatives believe that the gold currency issue will inevitably be included in the scope of the economic plan.</p>
<p>The resolution of the main cadre committee is to persuade the committees to prepare their revised new procedures and engage in discussions as soon as possible, hoping to reach an agreement. After the Economic Conference decided to maintain its existence, all markets around the world were positively affected today, and stocks and bonds saw price increases. (6th National Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Summary of Deliberations by Senior Officials</h3>
<p>Hull Uses Skill</p>
<p>To Shift Blame for Breakdown</p>
<p>(London) The senior officials of the World Economic Conference held a closed-door meeting yesterday morning, like jurors deliberating. The morning session lasted three hours, debating the fate of the conference. Meanwhile, representatives from various countries gathered near the conference room to await the decision. During lunchtime, several members of the senior staff went to the American embassy to attend a farewell banquet for Professor Moley. In the afternoon, the senior staff met again, but it was said to be an informal gathering, with the committee members simply listening to Chairman MacDonald's remarks. In the evening at 6 o'clock, the senior staff reconvened and decided that the committee members should continue their work. The fact that the economic conference was saved from immediate and complete destruction was due to the efforts of American representative Hull, British representative Chamberlain, and Canadian representative Bennett. It was reported that the atmosphere was very tense when the senior staff met yesterday morning. When dealing with the proposal from gold standard countries to postpone the conference, Hull delivered a moving speech, urging the conference to continue its work. He said that the representatives had not even discussed the surface of the agenda, so why should several countries' representatives resign simply because the currency stabilization issue, which was not on the agenda, was being raised? Hull reviewed the agenda items that the gold standard countries claimed they could not discuss. This move shifted the responsibility for the breakdown of the conference from President Roosevelt to the gold standard countries, demonstrating his skillful handling. (July 7, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Contents of Resolution by Senior Officials</h3>
<p>(London) According to British sources, the resolution passed by the senior staff today is divided into two sections. The first section is introductory in nature and includes a statement from the gold standard countries, so it is not a resolution of the senior staff. The senior staff believes that the conference must proceed. Although the unilateral statement from the gold standard countries is worded very strongly, the phrase "at present" shows that the inability to stabilize is only temporary. This phrase and the gold standard countries' emphasis on the need for stability are points that everyone has noticed. (July 6, Reuters)</p>
<h3>US President to Propose Further Reciprocal Tax Treaties</h3>
<p>(Washington) It has recently been learned from reliable sources that, as the London Economic Conference has been able to continue, US President Roosevelt is now planning to negotiate reciprocal tariff treaties in order to restore balance in international trade. Given that the London Economic Conference mostly opposes multilateral treaties to revise tariffs, it is expected that the US President's plan will be based on concluding bilateral treaties while retaining most-favored-nation clauses. (July 6, National Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Conference Tends to Follow Roosevelt's Plan</h3>
<p>A New Movement to Raise Prices</p>
<p>Is Quietly Developing</p>
<p>(London) At the World Economic Conference, there is now a new movement quietly developing to follow the US President's plan, with the conference aiming to raise prices. If successful, the</p>
<p>final result will be the establishment of a large group including the United States, the British Empire, the Scandinavian countries, Latin America, and the Far East. The continental European gold standard countries, if they do not abandon the gold standard or redefine currency values, will be isolated. (July 7, National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Britain's Attitude is Clear</h3>
<p>Showing Signs of Supporting US Policy</p>
<p>(London) Britain is now increasingly showing signs of gradually supporting US policy. The pressure from various autonomous territories has eliminated the possibility of the British joining the gold standard group. Now, its government leaders seem to be waiting for a more concrete indication of the success of the US President's policy of currency expansion before following the US example. The London Times, which has always reflected the government's intentions, stated frankly in today's editorial that the policies of Britain and its autonomous territories should move toward the same goals as those embraced by the US President, which is the most urgent plan for the world today. This shows the change in Britain's attitude. (July 7, National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Moley Leaves England to Return to the United States</h3>
<p>(London) Professor Moley, President Roosevelt's trusted advisor on economic matters, left London last night with his personal advisor, Mr. Swope, by car for Southampton, and boarded the Manhattan ship to go to the United States. When asked whether Professor Moley would resign after arriving in Washington, Mr. Swope replied that he would definitely not resign. The rumor that Moley was quite unhappy because President Roosevelt did not follow his advice was not true. Professor Moley did not advocate stabilization, but simply transmitted information. (July 7, Reuters)</p>
<h3>The United States Achieves a Moral Victory</h3>
<p>(Washington) The decision to continue the economic conference is seen here as a victory for the United States and the result of Roosevelt's "resolute attitude." However, people here are quite doubtful about what kind of work the economic conference can actually carry out. The general public believes that the so-called victory is purely in the moral realm. Since the economic conference cannot discuss currency and tariff issues, even if it continues its work, there will be no significant results. In addition, the United States' policy of economic isolation has fundamentally prevailed. The White House is now solely concerned with the issue of domestic economic recovery. As for diplomatic matters, it will not consider them unless absolutely necessary. It is rumored that the US representative to the Disarmament Conference, Mr. Davis, plans to go to Europe again as late as September, because the US government believes that it is not useful to discuss disarmament in the current situation. Davis had previously been active in Europe as President Roosevelt's personal</p>
<p>envoy. Now that the international trend has changed, it would be useless for Davis to go to Europe again as an envoy. It is likely that Davis will decline this mission. (July 6, Havas)</p>
<h3>A Grand Conference Leaves Only a Shell</h3>
<p>(London) The gold standard countries group has now collapsed, and the real situation remains unchanged. Since the gold standard countries are unwilling to participate in discussions on currency affairs, the conference's currency aspect will obviously not be able to do any truly beneficial work. Important economic committees such as those on tariffs and subsidies cannot function because the gold standard countries insist that it is useless to discuss these issues without first agreeing on stable currency prices. The only possible work now is to discuss items such as silver, lumber, wine, and sugar. It is expected that in a few days, the grand World Economic Conference will have only an empty shell left. (July 6, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Will Devote Himself to Domestic Affairs</h3>
<p>(Washington) As there are signs of increasing US capital, President Roosevelt has decided that the United States will avoid involvement in international affairs in the future and focus solely on domestic affairs, so that its economic recovery can be faster. It is reported that the United States has withdrawn from the international convention abolishing import and export bans. This time, the United States' firm disagreement with stabilizing currency prices is also evidence that President Roosevelt has decided to follow his own path. (July 6, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Washington) The director of the Economic Recovery Administration, General Johnson, plans to submit a cotton industry management charter to President Roosevelt. The main provisions include implementing a 40-hour work week, a minimum daily wage of $12 for cotton textile factories in southern cities and $13 in the north, and prohibiting the employment of underage workers. According to this charter, it is an unprecedented move. The original text is very long and will take several days to study. At the last minute, Johnson suddenly abandoned the idea of submitting it immediately, saying that President Roosevelt should first study other issues, but he did not elaborate on what these other issues were. (July 6, Havas)</p>
<h3>Speculative Gambling Sweeps Across the United States</h3>
<p>(New York) According to the New York Sun, the trend of securities speculation is now sweeping across the United States. Brokers with branches in the interior have received reports from their investigators stating that the orders received by securities and commodities firms are more than in 1929, the year of peak trading. Brokers in various industries in Chicago are very active, and cotton trading in the South is also very strong. Loans into the New York Stock Exchange increased by 47% in June, reaching $780,386,000, which is the highest number since October 1931. (July 6, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Various Committees Meet</h3>
<p>To Discuss the Scope of Work Separately</p>
<p>Currency First-Aid Group</p>
<p>French Finance Minister Represents Gold Standard Countries</p>
<p>Argues that Discussions Should be Limited to Debt</p>
<p>(London) The Currency Committee's First-Aid Subcommittee met, and the chairman announced that it was the unanimous desire of the committee to continue its work. There are several issues on the agenda awaiting discussion, namely: 1) new loans; 2) restrictions on exchange rate fluctuations; 3) debt; 4) the restoration of capital flows; and 5) whether the committee should continue its work. British representative Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain stated that these issues could be discussed in their entirety. The French and Romanian representatives, however, believed that discussions should be limited to debt issues. The Brazilian representative proposed that all issues be raised for discussion, but divided into two subcommittees, one including gold standard countries and the other including "currency freedom" countries, to discuss them separately. French Finance Minister Bonnet responded to British Chancellor Chamberlain at the meeting, recounting the changes in the attitudes of the various delegations, stating that if a currency truce could not be implemented, then the overall issue could not be considered. Bonnet stated firmly that he understood the various difficulties of the United States, so he did not criticize President Roosevelt's change of attitude. He also stated that since the Economic Conference's Currency Committee had established a First-Aid Subcommittee, it could be seen that the Economic Conference considered the solution to this problem essential. If several friendly delegations wished to conduct new experiments at present, they were welcome to do so, but they could not force other delegations to change their attitudes. Furthermore, "putting aside the issue of stabilizing currencies is contrary to the purpose of the Economic Conference, as Prime Minister MacDonald has already stated clearly." Bonnet then explained that the various subcommittees of the Economic Committee must continue to discuss, and finally said, "The French delegation sincerely wishes the Economic Conference to be successful, and its stance is to guarantee the success of the Economic Conference, so it will not change it under any circumstances." From the above, it is still unknown what the final decision on the continuation of the Currency Committee's work will be. However, the position of the gold standard countries has been stated, and it is possible that this decision will not completely follow the wishes of the gold standard countries. It is generally believed that if the Currency Committee decides to continue its work, the gold standard countries may consider only appointing observers to attend. As for the Brazilian representative's proposal to establish two subcommittees, one for gold standard countries and one for "currency freedom" countries, to discuss separately, it may not be passed. (July 7, Havas)</p>
<h3>Economic Committee</h3>
<p>Production and Sales Group Decides to Continue Working</p>
<p>Commerce Group Gets to Limit the Scope of Discussion</p>
<p>Lumber Subcommittee Postpones Meeting to October</p>
<p>(London) The Economic Committee also held a closed-door meeting this morning for one hour, unanimously deciding to proceed as usual with the two issues of overall adjustment of production and indirect protectionism. Subsequently, the two subcommittees on commercial policy and subsidized shipping also met separately to discuss the scope of work that could be continued. After the commercial policy subcommittee met, the French representative immediately moved to dissolve the committee, arguing that tariffs and quotas could not be discussed in the current situation. The Italian representative followed, strongly advocating for the gold standard countries. British Secretary of Commerce Runciman came forward to counter, formally proposing that the committee continue its work. US representative MacMurray, Japanese representative Ishii, and Argentine representative Peco all strongly supported the British proposal. The two sides engaged in heated debate for a long time, and finally decided to continue working, electing a drafting committee to draft a new outline for future work. According to a representative speaking to reporters, the forces opposing the continuation of work within the committee were very strong, so it was necessary to carefully consider what on the agenda could still be discussed. In general, in the near future, the scope of discussion will be limited to most-favored-nation clauses, the abolition of quotas, and tariff and trade restrictions. After the subsidized shipping subcommittee met, despite the firm opposition of the French and Italian representatives, it still decided to continue its work, but it would follow the commercial policy subcommittee for advances and retreats, and adopted the Japanese representative's proposal to suggest this situation to the senior staff committee. (July 7, National Telegram)</p>
<p>The Lumber Subcommittee also decided today to suspend discussions until October, while the Wine Subcommittee had almost completed its work, and this morning decided to actively promote the opposition to alcohol prohibition. (July 7, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Japan Has No Intention of Withdrawing From the Convention on Abolishing Restrictions on Imports and Exports</h3>
<p>Will Seek Alternative Countermeasures</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the international treaty established in 1927 to abolish import and export prohibitions and restrictions, the United States notified its withdrawal on the 5th, and the United Kingdom had already withdrawn from the treaty. As a result, only four countries are participating: Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Finland, which reduces the effectiveness of the treaty. However, Japanese Foreign Ministry officials attach great importance to the withdrawal of the two major powers, Britain and the United States, as it makes economic imperialism superficial. However, Japan has no intention of withdrawing from the treaty at this time, and its policy will be to seek alternative countermeasures. (July 7, Dentsu)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Situation in Xinjiang Cannot Be Ignored Zi</h3>
<p>The political upheaval in Xinjiang occurred on April 12th. Since then, it has been almost three months since Jin Shuren was forced to flee. Before the beginning of June, although the emerging leaders were vying for power and did not yield to each other, they all expressed their submission to the Central Government and sent telegrams requesting the dispatch of senior officials. It seemed that once the senior officials from the Central Government arrived, the disputes would not be difficult to resolve and the situation would not be difficult to stabilize. When Huang Musong, as Deputy Chief of Staff, was sent to comfort the region and arrived in Dihua in mid-June, Ma Zhongying of the Hui people was the first to disobey the restraints and aggressively invaded the provincial capital. Now that Ma Zhongying's affairs have just been resolved, problems have arisen within the provincial capital. Tao Mingyue was the most powerful figure in the previous overthrow of Jin. Chen Zhong was appointed to Moscow after the political upheaval and was of the same faction as Liu Wenlong and Sheng Shicai. However, recent telegrams have reported that Tao, Chen, and Li Xiaotian were shot and killed by Liu and Sheng for conspiring to reorganize the provincial government. It is even said that Envoy Huang Musong is being monitored. This is not only enough to reveal the infighting among the emerging leaders in Xinjiang, but also allows us to understand their so-called submission to the Central Government.</p>
<p>The Xinjiang affair is not a simple provincial affair. Among the neighboring provinces, the leaders of Ningxia and Qinghai belong to the same Hui people as Ma Zhongying, and there is no intention to help each other. Lu Dachang, who has a special influence in the Northwest, wants to help Jin restore his power because he is from the same hometown as Jin Shuren. In terms of external forces, Ma Shaowu in Kashgar is close to the British and dominates the southern route. Zhang Peiyuan in Ili is a pro-Russian faction and also has power. During the April political upheaval, Liu and Sheng were able to succeed because of the invading forces of the Hui army outside and the troops of Tao Mingyue stationed at key locations in the provincial capital. After this, all parties were able to temporarily maintain the old state due to Liu and Sheng's perfunctory attitude and waiting for the Central Government to send a special envoy to deal with it fairly. Therefore, there were no actions except for Ma Zhongying. In this incident, there is infighting within the provincial capital, and the senior officials of the Central Government cannot freely exercise their powers. It is feared that this will not lead to disputes between the various parties outside the province, which is not what reason allows.</p>
<p>Xinjiang has 1.64 million square kilometers of land. Among all the administrative regions in the country, it is the largest province. Its area cannot be compared with that of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, which are only 100,000 square kilometers. Even large provinces like Sichuan (400,000 square kilometers) are only a quarter of its size. Now, in this vast region, the government is losing control due to political reasons, and a major change is brewing. The future is difficult and frightening to speak of. How will the people of our country urge the government to quickly take effective measures to avoid seeing an unbearable situation in the Northwest after the fall of the Northeast?</p>
<h3>The Stalemate in the Negotiations on the Chinese Eastern Railway</h3>
<p>Japan Conducts Mediation Again</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Negotiations on the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway have long been deadlocked due to the issue of ownership. The "Manchukuo" representative, Mr. Ohashi, visited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday to consult with the Director of the European and American Affairs Bureau, Mr. Togo, on the date of the next meeting. As a result, it was decided that after the Soviet Union receives instructions, a formal meeting will be held once, and then private consultations will be held. The next meeting will be around the 11th. If it is still difficult to reach an agreement at that time and there is no hope of opening up the future of the negotiations, the meeting will be temporarily adjourned in the name of summer vacation in mid-August, and efforts will be made to ease the atmosphere between the two sides during that time. (July 7, Dentsu)</p>
<p>(Tokyo (The Soviet Union said regarding the future of the negotiations on the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway that the Japanese proposal will inevitably have detours and twists and turns in the future negotiations, but the result can be resolved. Therefore, there is no need to ask Moscow for instructions again and it is intended to proceed according to the usual policy. The next meeting is scheduled for around the 11th, and there will be no break in August, with the intention to continue the meeting. (July 7, Dentsu)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The "Manchukuo" Deputy Foreign Minister, Mr. Ohashi, visited the Director of the European and American Affairs Bureau, Mr. Togo, at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 4 p.m. today. After conveying the following opinions from the "Manchukuo" side regarding the negotiations on the purchase of the Chinese Eastern Railway, he had various discussions on future countermeasures. The purchase price is still maintained at 50 million Japanese yen and will not be conceded. If the relationship between Russia and Manchuria is theoretically as opposed as it is now, even private meetings will be ineffective. Therefore, "Manchukuo" does not advocate private meetings. The next meeting is currently awaiting a proposal from the Soviet Union. If this is the case, if the Soviet Union does not actively try to open up the situation at the next meeting, it will inevitably be in a state of standstill. (July 7, Dentsu)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is widely rumored that the negotiations between Russia and Manchuria on the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway are about to break down due to differences of opinion between the two sides. Some say that certain aspects of the Japanese and Manchurian political circles advocate dealing with the Chinese Eastern Railway dispute with an active plan to avoid it collapsing. However, according to a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today, it is still difficult to predict how the meeting will end, as it is only in the initial stages. He also said that Japan will mediate when necessary to achieve a peaceful solution, hoping that the two sides can continue to meet at the beginning of next week. (July 7, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Impressions of He Huaide's Tour of the East)</p>
<h3>Only the Use of Force Can Drive Japan Out of Manchuria</h3>
<p>Not Optimistic About US-Japan Relations</p>
<p>Advocates Building Warships to Deal with Militarism</p>
<p>US Recognition of Soviet Russia Promotes Balance of Power in the Far East</p>
<p>San Francisco, USA. He Huaide, the director of various newspapers and the United News Agency, returned here today after inspecting the Far East and told San Francisco journalists his impressions of the Far Eastern situation. Japan has created an Alsace-Lorraine in the Far East. (Note: Alsace-Lorraine was a disputed territory between France and Germany. It was ceded to Germany in the Franco-Prussian War and is now back in France. These two provinces were also a cause of the European War.) Only the use of force can make Japan withdraw from Manchuria, and he said that what he said was entirely based on impressions gained from talking to Chinese and Japanese leaders. The Chinese people are fully aware of the problems that are necessary to make the Japanese withdraw from Manchuria. Chinese leaders all said that the current major work is to create the necessary power to achieve this goal. They all know that they cannot get help from the League of Nations to recover Manchuria, but only by training an army capable of defeating Japan.</p>
<p>Mr. He is also not optimistic about relations between Japan and the United States, saying that American politicians must think twice before acting against Japan. The future peace of the Pacific depends on the grand vision of these people. There has never been a time with fewer sources of friction between the two countries before, and there is still something serious in the current relationship between the two countries, but this phenomenon is mostly caused by different mentalities and less by conflicts of fundamental principles. If problems arise, they are handled with frank, direct, and friendly exchanges of opinions, it will be easier to gain a deeper understanding. Events that have created tense situations from time to time in the past are caused by a lack of understanding, and even a lack of understanding among those in power. Japan can never understand the true motives of the United States for excluding Asians. He believes that the United States should abolish the exclusion laws, stipulate an immigration quota, and establish a basis for increasing mutual respect.</p>
<p>Mr. He also advocated building new warships to the limit of the London Treaty to eliminate the American notion of solely advocating peace and to provide insurance against unexpected events, because short-sighted militarists will cause unexpected events.</p>
<p>Mr. He also believes that US recognition of Soviet Russia can bring about a better balance in the Far East, and may be the first step in a new policy of the United States moving towards recognizing governments that have been established and can exercise their powers, without overemphasizing the circumstances of their emergence.

The various departments of the Hui people should be allowed to send representatives to reside in Beijing permanently, and set up offices like the Mongolians and Tibetans to avoid isolation. 7. The new provincial government should send more Hui youths to study in the interior to cultivate talent. 8.

Today, the Executive Committee of the Austrian National Socialist Party met here, denouncing Dollfuss's remarks and solemnly announcing that the National Socialist Party would never deviate from the policy of German-Austrian union and would never support a puppet leader. Any party member who wishes to cooperate with Dollfuss's cabinet will be expelled from the party and regarded as a traitor. Dollfuss may be able to destroy the organs of the National Socialist Party, but he will never be able to destroy the spirit of the National Socialist Party. The National Socialist Party in Austria will eventually succeed like their German comrades.</p>
<h3>Poland and Danzig Make Peace</h3>

<h3>Central Government Approves Xia Douyin's Resignation</h3>
<p>Provincial Government Begins Handover Procedures with a Deadline for Completion</p>
<p>Rumors of a Mutual Transfer for the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs and the Mayor of Hankou</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence - Xia Douyin, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, has repeatedly telegraphed the central government to resign due to illness and exhaustion, but has been repeatedly persuaded to stay. However, Xia's determination to leave is firm. On the 3rd, he again telegraphed the Military Affairs Commission Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei, pleading his case once more. The telegram stated, "Douyin, with limited talent, has presumptuously served as the administrator of Hubei. With little ability and heavy responsibilities, I have long feared being unable to bear the burden. I have repeatedly pleaded to resign, but have not received approval. Recently, due to external influences triggering old ailments, my condition has worsened daily, making it impossible for me to continue in this important position and potentially delay important public affairs. Therefore, I earnestly request to be relieved of my duties as a member and chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, and to appoint another capable person to take my place and assist in the great cause. This urgent telegram expresses my sincere gratitude." After sending this telegram, Xia has not been to the government office. The issue of reorganizing the provincial government has become increasingly certain. On the 5th, according to important officials of the provincial government, Xia has repeatedly resigned to the central government due to a recurrence of his old illness, so that he can recuperate. He has now received a reply from the central government approving his resignation. Regarding handover matters, he has instructed all departments and the secretariat to actively handle them, and it is expected that they will be completed within this week. As for the selection of a successor, there were initially rumors of choosing one among Yang Yongtai, Zhang Qun, Chiang Tso-pao, and Wu Xingya, with Yang being the most favored. If Yang is unwilling to take the position, then Zhang has a good chance. There was originally no news of changes to the heads of the various departments and the mayor of Hankou. On the 5th, rumors emerged of a mutual transfer between Li Shucheng, Li Fanyi, and Wu Guozhen. Wu, who was originally the mayor of Hankou, will be transferred to the position of Director of the Department of Civil Affairs. Li Shucheng, who was originally the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, will be transferred to the position of Director of the Department of Construction. Li Fanyi, who was originally the Director of the Department of Construction, will be transferred to the position of Mayor of Hankou. Cheng Qibao, the Director of Education, and Fan Xiji, the Director of Security, will remain in their original positions. Cheng took over the Education Department on the 4th and appointed Yang Daosheng and Chen Yingkun as secretaries, and Ren Hesheng, Yang Baisheng, and Yin Yuanxun as section chiefs of the first, second, and third sections. Zhang Shiguan, Xiang Xinkui, Li Guokui, Wang Jiean, Zhou Shiwan, and Fang Shanwei were appointed as provincial supervisors. Cheng's plan to improve education can be divided into two items: (1) Promote rural education and restore education in bandit-controlled areas; (2) Seek independent and increased funding for education. The total education expenditure for the province was originally set at 160,000 yuan per month, but it has now been decided that the provincial treasury will allocate an additional 10,000 yuan per month, which will need to be increased to 30,000 to 40,000 yuan in the future in order to fully implement (the plan).

<h3>Extremely Hot Weather in Japan</h3>
<p>(Breaking a New Record in 54 Years)</p>
<p>Osaka Asahi Shimbun, July 3rd - Since the beginning of summer, the heat has been unbearable, and the mercury has suddenly soared. The heat on the 2nd broke the new record in 54 years since the Osaka Meteorological Observatory was established. The high pressure over the eastern ocean off the coast of Japan is exceptionally hot, shifting to a corner of the Kinki region, reaching 768 millibars. At 2-3 PM, it rose to 93.5 degrees Fahrenheit, or 34.2 degrees Celsius. This astonishingly high temperature has not been heard of since the Meiji 12th year. The heat in the first ten days is also the third highest record, following 34.9 degrees Celsius on July 7th of Meiji 43rd year and 34.3 degrees Celsius on July 9th of the 33rd year, rising to 7.4 degrees higher than usual years. Other regions such as Shikoku, Tokai, Hokuriku, and Sanin are relatively cool due to rain, but the climate is still hotter than this year.</p>
<p>According to various Japanese newspapers, there are 62 cases of smallpox in Tokyo, and the epidemic is severe. The Metropolitan Police Department is struggling to cope, and people filling the streets to get vaccinated to prevent infection. People are panicking, and the situation is dire.</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese Representatives' Consultations in Dalian Conclude</h3>
<p>Basic Agreement Reached on Incorporating Puppet Troops and Opening the Beining Railway to Traffic</p>
<p>A Second Formal Meeting Will Be Held in Tanggu</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Beiping - In the Sino-Japanese representatives' consultations in Dalian, the Japanese side suddenly proposed conditions such as joint Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo management of the Beining Railway's Luyu section and stationing surveillance troops in Luanzhou, Miyun, and other places. This matter is of great importance. Our representatives immediately telegraphed the authorities for instructions. The information was leaked, and the Pingjin newspapers revealed it. The Japanese side then made a serious inquiry to our authorities that evening, stating that diplomatic secrets should not be disclosed in newspapers, hindering the progress of negotiations. As a result, the records of this matter in the Pingjin newspapers were restricted by external forces. From this, it can be seen that weak nations not only have no diplomacy, but much more. The two conditions proposed by the Japanese side, one would make us implicitly recognize the puppet state, and the other would place North China in a permanent precarious position, which our side could not possibly accept. After our authorities telegraphed the central government for instructions, the central government telegraphed back, advocating that the armistice agreement should be used as the basis, and other demands that went beyond the scope could not be recognized. Upon receiving the telegram, the authorities telegraphed the representatives waiting in Dalian to first exchange views on issues such as the puppet troops, and temporarily shelve other issues. The representatives continued to discuss with the Japanese representatives and Li Jichun, etc. As of last night (the 5th), a basic agreement had been reached on issues such as the puppet troops and the opening of the Beining Railway to military traffic. The consultations in Dalian thus came to an end. Our representatives Xue Zhiheng, Lei Shourong, Yin Tong, etc., are scheduled to return to Tianjin from Dalian tomorrow (the 7th). Li Jichun will return to Tangshan to arrange everything. Japanese representative Kita will also take a boat to Tanggu to prepare to continue discussions with us.</p>
<p>The consultations in Dalian were only preparatory in nature, making initial contact with all issues, and then a formal meeting will be held in Tanggu. The procedures are quite similar to the previous armistice negotiations. The signing of the armistice agreement was first done by Xu Zuyi going to Miyun for consultations, and then formally signing in Tanggu. The same is true now. Within days, the receiving committee and the Japanese representatives will hold a formal meeting in Tanggu, and a written document will be drawn up with the results agreed upon in Dalian, and then both parties will implement it accordingly.</p>
<p>According to the authorities' announcement of the results of the consultations in Dalian, the receiving committee dispatched representatives Lei Shourong, Xue Zhiheng, Yin Tong, etc. to Dalian to consult with the Japanese representatives, which was an exchange of views between the two parties and a step that should be taken after the establishment of the armistice agreement, with no so-called meeting or signing. Moreover, the representatives did not have the authority to sign. There were two main issues discussed: (1) the aftermath of the puppet troops, (2) the restoration of traffic on the Beining Railway. Regarding the restoration of traffic on the Beining Railway, a complete solution has been reached. As for the aftermath of the puppet troops, it was agreed that two-thirds of the puppet troops within the war zone would be disbanded, and one-third would be incorporated and reorganized into security teams. The content announced by the authorities is only a few words. How the problem of restoring traffic on the Beining Railway was solved, whether it was attached with conditions, and the exact number and location of the incorporated puppet troops are all kept secret. There is much speculation about this matter from the outside. According to some sources, regarding the opening of the Beining Railway, the Japanese side initially insisted that a committee be jointly organized by China, Japan, and Manchukuo to manage the Lutai to Shanhaiguan section together. After negotiations, it was still returned to our management, but Japanese technical personnel must be dispatched to work on the road. If this is true, it is no different from joint management in disguise. As for the number of puppet troops to be incorporated, our side advocated at most 5,000, while the puppet troops advocated at least 8,000. A compromise has now been reached, with the number being between 5,000 and 8,000, organized into a security brigade, limited to those with complete firearms, stationed in areas within the war zone, far from the railway line, approximately in Jixian and Baodi.</p>
<p>The special forces of the Japanese army in the war zone, such as the Hattori Brigade, have all been transferred back to their country. The Eighth Division, which invaded the Miyun area, is mostly concentrated in Chengde, Gubeikou, Miyun, Huairou, and other places, with a small part remaining. In recent days, the Japanese troops on the Miyun front have withdrawn, but the left and right wings are still holding their original positions and there is no movement. Two artillery teams are stationed in Miyun city. Japanese tanks often come and go on the road from Gubeikou to Miyun. In Huairou, 40-50 Japanese soldiers in the city were withdrawn a few days ago, and a small team has now been sent to the city to stay, which is said to be a rotation of troops. The Japanese Tenth Division and part of the Fourteenth Division south of Xifengkou in Zunhua, Jixian, Sanhe, Yutian, Fengrun, and other areas have mostly been transferred to northern Manchuria. Currently, only a small part remains stationed on the Great Wall line. There are no traces of Japanese troops in Tongzhou, Sanhe, Jixian, Xianghe, Yutian, and other places. There are still 40-50 Japanese soldiers stationed in Tunying, east of Zunhua. A part of the infantry is also stationed at Cheheqiao, upstream of the Luan River. The Japanese Sixth Division, which invaded eastern Luan, will use Jinzhou as a concentration point, and will mostly withdraw to the south of Liaoning for defense. However, this unit has not yet withdrawn, and the puppet troops in eastern Luan are also extremely active. The war zone will be gradually taken over after the second meeting in Tanggu resolves various disputes. (July 6th)</p>
<h3>Diary After the Fall of Jixian</h3>
<p>The People Are Brutally Tormented by the Enemy, Puppets, and Traitors</p>
<p>Hope the Government Quickly Takes Over the Lost Territory</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence - "The Sino-North China Armistice Agreement has been signed for over a month, and the promise that Japanese soldiers will return to the Great Wall line" has not been fulfilled. Instead, the Japanese are secretly helping traitors and rebels expand their strength, so the nineteen counties of eastern and western Luan cannot be taken over. Chairman Huang Fu jumped into the fire pit, but the people of the nineteen counties are still groaning in the fire pit and have not been rescued. Reluctantly, Xue Zhiheng and others were sent to Dalian, where the Japanese are making unreasonable demands. If we compromise again, the nineteen counties will surely become a burden, and over ten million people will be trapped in the fire pit forever. Here is a letter from a friend in Jixian describing the tragic situation, which is infuriating and heartbreaking. What happens in one corner is indicative of the whole situation. I have selected excerpts on the left, hoping that those who care about national affairs will not regard it as a trivial matter. At Nan Tianmen of Xifengkou, our army maintained an advantage throughout the bloody battle, but because the Luan River line retreated without a fight, this road had to retreat with it. On May 15th, the headquarters of the 29th Army and its affiliated divisions and brigades were moving backward one after another. The cars transporting the wounded did not stop all night. A large amount of grain, ammunition, and supplies in front were also actively transported to the rear. Seeing this, the people were panic-stricken, carrying baskets, loads, children, and fleeing in a hurry. On the 16th, the front line had retreated to Shimen Town (the border between Zunhua and Jixian). The enemy army sent more than 20 bombers to follow the Pingxi highway and bombed our retreating troops, as well as baggage trains and grain trucks. From Shimen Town to Mashan Bridge Town in Jixian, more than 100 heavy bombs were dropped, killing many soldiers and civilians and destroying a large number of baggage trains and vehicles. The sound of explosions could be heard clearly hundreds of miles away. People were more panicked, shops closed, and pedestrians on the road were all refugees fleeing the city. The refugees on the Pingxi Avenue looked at each other. On the 17th, the well-to-do families and poor women and children in the county seat had fled completely. Commander-in-Chief Song Zheyuan arrived in the county, invited representatives of the gentry and merchants, and said few words when they met. He immediately said, "Our army is fighting the enemy on the Great Wall, and the local people are suffering greatly. Now our army has been ordered to retreat, and there are more than 10,000 bags of rice and flour in your county, which are all donated to your county to relieve the victims." The representatives said that the people in this county have fled, and nine out of ten houses are empty. It would be better if your army could transport the rice and flour away. Otherwise, we will keep it for you. If we are unable to keep it, please forgive us. On that day, our front line had retreated to Linhezhuang (40 miles from Jixian). We originally planned to resist, but because our army on the Luan River retreated too quickly, the enemy's tanks and cavalry rushed to the right wing of our army from Yutian through Yanshankou. Our army was greatly threatened and could not resist, and collapsed in a mess, abandoning countless military supplies, guns, and ammunition along the way. At this time, the morale of the army was</p>
<p>dispirited, and they abandoned their weapons and changed their clothes to escape. The Jixian Security Regiment, which had received military training and participated in the battle to defend against aggression at Xifengkou, feared that the enemy army would retaliate when they arrived, so it was decided that all armed personnel would lead their families to retreat with the 29th Army. Due to the urgency of time, only a hundred or so people were gathered, and the 29th Army organized them into a special service team, supplying them with provisions, and retreating with the army headquarters to Beiping. At dawn on the 18th, our army retreated to the Phoenix Mountain position (five miles outside Jixian City) and confronted the enemy army. Shao Kan, the county magistrate of Jixian, also left alone because the order inside and outside the city was already chaotic and the city was about to fall, and took the road to Sanhe to report to the provincial government in Tianjin. On this day, the refugees outside the city ran around, fleeing from Village A to Village B, and from Village B to Village C, like ants on a hot pot, not knowing where the utopia was. Mothers lost their children, brothers lost their brothers, the old and weak supported each other, and the state of being displaced and helpless is beyond words. What is even more heartbreaking is that the undisciplined defeated soldiers took advantage of the fire to loot and rob the refugees of their property. The sound of mourning and crying shook the heavens and the earth. I (the reporter's friend, hereinafter referred to as the same) initially planned to flee with the refugees to Pingjin, but when I went outside the city, I realized that our army had destroyed the main road section by section and buried landmines. If I wanted to detour through the trails, I was afraid that the defeated soldiers would take advantage of the fire to loot, and the enemy planes would come to bomb from time to time. Looking around, I had nowhere to go, so I had to turn north and go to a friend's place in the valley to take refuge temporarily. When I arrived at my friend's house, there were already more than 100 people who had arrived before me. In a mountain village with less than 100 households, there were as many as two or three thousand refugees, and they could not get a grain of rice all day long. It can be said that they were eating the wind and sleeping in the dew. The misery of the situation was no less than that of Avici hell. That afternoon, a certain regiment of the 40th Army, because it had lost contact during the retreat, entered the village to hide and wait for orders. Seeing that there were too many refugees and a lack of rice and noodles, they immediately set off for other places. At this time, contact had been made at the Phoenix Mountain position, and the sound of artillery was rumbling. It stopped slightly at night, and our army withdrew from the county seat that night. At 6:00 a.m. on the 19th, more than 20 merchants in the city elected representatives, raised a white flag, and went out of the city to welcome the enemy army into the city. There were five tanks, artillery, and cavalry of less than 1,000 people, which were part of a certain brigade and the Hattori Brigade. Our retreating army was no less than 100,000, but it could not resist this small group of enemies. Is this not heartbreaking? After the enemy army entered the city, they searched along the streets, and then searched every household, entering the hall and entering the room, flipping boxes and turning over chests, searching for soft money and gold coins, and forcing the local people to hand over horses and women. Because they spoke Japanese, the Chinese did not understand, and many were shot and killed. A white-haired old woman with a certain surname who had not been able to escape was ravaged to the point of near death by more than ten enemy soldiers. Such inhuman and undisciplined soldiers have truly tarnished the imperial army of a civilized country. On the 20th, the enemy attacked west again, attacking Duanjialing (the border between Sanhe and Jixian). At the same time, a large number of planes were sent to scout the villages in this county. Within 20 miles along the avenue, there were no people. On the 21st, the enemy army captured Duanjiadian and occupied Sanhe. Only a dozen or so guards were left in Jixian. The merchants in the city had organized a temporary security maintenance committee, which was equivalent to a support bureau, to raise provisions for the enemy army. I also ventured into the city on this day to see the truth. I walked 20 miles without meeting a single person, and there was no sound of chickens crowing or dogs barking. The wheat was yellow and lying on the ground, and no one was harvesting it. There were three or five corpses lying beside the road, and crows were fighting for their meat. If the loyal souls knew, I don't know what they would feel. I have not seen ancient battlefields, but I see the scene of national subjugation</p>
<p>with my own eyes today. After entering the city, the enemy army shouted slogans in Japanese in the streets, "Asia is the Asia of Asians," "East Asia is not peaceful, the world is not peaceful," "Only when the people of Japan, Manchukuo, and China join hands can there be peace," "Japan is overthrowing the evil warlords of China and seeking happiness for merchants and people," and all kinds of nonsensical slogans are infuriating. There was also a notice in Chinese issued by the security team headquarters, which roughly said, "Japan is deploying troops to eliminate the unreasonable warlords of China for the sake of East Asian peace and to seek happiness for good merchants and good people. Since the war, we have been victorious in every battle and invincible. Anyone who dares to resist will be resolutely eliminated by force." The arrogance is unparalleled. There are no pedestrians on the roads inside and outside the city. Broken wells and ruined walls are heartbreaking. I dared not stay long and returned to the mountain village that day. The atrocities of the enemy army in various places were also reported one after another. The cavalry and artillery of two or three hundred people stationed in Shangcang Town had the worst discipline. They searched for property from house to house in groups of three or five, and indulged in bestial lusts when they encountered women. There is no pure land in dozens of villages nearby. The massacre of Jiading and the ten days of Yangzhou are probably no more miserable than this. In Xiaobagou Village, six miles away from Tucang Town, there were about 1,000 households. One day, three enemy soldiers entered the village to search for women. When they arrived at the Ma family's house, Ma was skilled in martial arts and had great strength. He politely refused to let them enter the house. The enemy soldiers angrily drew their bayonets and stabbed Ma fiercely. Ma waved his hand, and the bayonet flew out several feet away. The soldiers became more angry and drew their guns to shoot. Ma turned around and entered the room to take a rifle and shoot. He fell to the ground after being shot. After shooting again, he also fell to the ground. Ma thought they were dead, so he entered the village to report and bury the bodies. Unexpectedly, when he went to the outside of the village again, the enemy corpses were gone. The enemy soldiers had pretended to be dead with injuries and taken the opportunity to escape. Ma knew that they would definitely return to the camp to report, so he could not be reconciled. A great disaster was coming. All the old and young people in the village fled in the middle of the night. The next morning, more than 100 Japanese soldiers came with several field guns and surrounded the village. They entered the village to search, but no one was there, so they carried out wanton destruction and left. Right after several days, the villagers asked someone to mediate. As a result, they paid 3,000 yuan, four guns, and four horses before the matter was settled. Also, a woman and a daughter with a certain surname in Wangzhuangzi Village were raped by enemy soldiers. A certain person reported to the commander of the enemy army. The commander summoned the woman and daughter of a certain person and examined their reproductive organs three times, proving that they had been defiled. He then announced, "This was caused by the soldiers' sexual impulse after drinking alcohol. They should be sentenced to ten days of confinement." The woman then committed suicide out of shame, and a certain person went crazy and became a cripple. Also, Wang Derong, a translator from the security team headquarters stationed in Jixian, was from Liaoning and had studied at a Japanese school since he was a child, so he joined the Japanese army. He spoke fluent Japanese. One day, enemy soldiers checked the household registration and went to Meng San's house in Dongguan. Meng secretly complained, and Wang heard him. He took Meng to the team headquarters and tortured him extremely. He died and came back to life again and again. He also asked Meng what country he was from. When Meng answered that he was Chinese, he was tortured even more. When he answered that he was from Manchukuo, it was lighter. Then they planned to shoot him, but after the pleas of many people from the temporary security maintenance committee, he was released. Wang Derong even fabricated that when he arrested Meng in Meng's house, he lost 100 yuan in cash and silver, and Meng had to compensate for it. After repeated requests from the maintenance committee, Meng compensated 50 yuan and the matter was settled. In addition to these illegal acts, there is no end to them. More than 10,000 bags of rice and flour left by Commander Song have been transported away in full by the captain of the guard team, Qingliu Changlu, on June 21st. There are no enemy troops in the entire county at the moment, and bandits are rising up in all directions, robbing everywhere in groups of hundreds. Farmers dare not return to their villages to work. The security of the county seat is jointly maintained by the security regiment, the merchant regiment, and the police, and Kang Chunquan, the former captain of the Public Security Bureau, serves as the temporary director of the Public Security Bureau. Fearing that the bandits would attack the city, they closed the city gates tightly, and gunshots were incessant at night. Although the enemy troops have withdrawn, there are still small groups of cavalry coming to scout from time to time. Puppet troops and ronin are taking advantage of this period to carry out activities on a large scale. A few days ago, Du Yi, the commander of the puppet army, came to the county from Tangshan and ordered local people to elect a county magistrate, refusing to allow the Jizhou provincial authorities to take over. If military force is insufficient, troops can be transferred from Tangshan. He also wanted to collect the old guns of the security regiment and issue new guns. The gentry and merchants in the county, with millions of people, have become helpless orphans. They had to deal with him hypocritically. Unexpectedly, two days after Du Yi left, Li Jichun sent two more members, forcing the local authorities to elect a county magistrate quickly. Their momentum was overwhelming and unreasonable. All circles were forced to convene representatives from all circles and district chiefs and regiment chiefs at the Public Security Bureau on June 28th, and the members monitored the vote. As a result, Liu Huafeng was elected. If our Jizhou provincial authorities can quickly send a county magistrate, take over the lost territory according to law, reorganize the security regiment, and suppress the bandits, then millions of people still have a glimmer of hope. If they delay any longer, they will give the enemy, puppets, and traitors the opportunity to collude, which will inevitably create a complicated situation that will be difficult to resolve.

<h3>Two Bandits Arrested in the Major Robbery Case at Xihutang, Punan</h3>
<p>Xihutang in Punan is a coastal area that produces salt, and bandit activity is common. Cai Peida, a wealthy household in the town, owns hundreds of acres of fertile land. He usually lives frugally and manages his household diligently, accumulating a significant fortune over the years, which he secretly hid at home. This attracted the attention of bandits, who broke into his house on the evening of the 28th of last month. The homeowner, seeing the unfavorable situation, quickly hid in the dark and escaped during the chaos. Three bandits went upstairs, and four went directly into the downstairs bedroom, robbing two small leather suitcases containing hidden cash. They also opened chests and drawers, looting antiques, valuable ornaments, and other items before fleeing. It was later rumored that there were a total of fifteen bandits, each receiving 600 yuan. Sixteen shares were distributed, leaving several thousand yuan, which was embezzled by the bandits or kept for other purposes. It was also said that the bandits quarreled over the uneven distribution of the loot, which was discovered by Fan Zhicheng, the head of the First Water Police Team. He arrested two suspects in the case: Liang A'wu, a warehouse head, and Liu A'san from Caojing. During interrogation, Liang confessed to running an opium den, and Liu confessed to receiving twenty yuan and implicated other bandits. They were immediately taken to the implicated addresses for arrest, but the other bandits had already fled after hearing the news. Liang and Liu were first transferred to the Fourth District Commissioner's Office for interrogation. Later, a female bandit, Shen Dongshi, was arrested at a certain location, and stolen goods, including four leather suitcases, were found at Fang’s residence and Shen Yongliang’s home. They were transferred to the Minhang District Office for interrogation. It was reported that the suitcases contained antiques. Except for the suitcases, which were kept in the district, the female bandit was sent to the prosecutor's office for interrogation today. Relatives of the Cai family came to Songjiang and reported that the two small leather suitcases contained a total of 16,400 yuan in cash, which was completely robbed. Since the incident, many out-of-town residents living in Caojing and Xihutang have left. It is expected that the entire case will be solved soon.</p>

<p>Appeal Trial for the Case of Murdering One's Own Husband Commences: Jiang Qinsheng, a training instructor of the Yanhong Township Security Corps in Changshu, was strangled to death with a firewood rope by his wife, Jiang Wangshi, in collusion with her lover, Yu Sanbao, on November 15th of last year, and the body was buried in the suburbs. It was not until April 6th of this year that Jiang’s dog dug up the body. Jiang’s younger brother, Lichu, reported the incident to the Public Security Bureau, which arrested the adulterer and adulteress and sentenced them to death by the county. The defendants refused to accept the original judgment and appealed to the Jiangsu High Court. On the afternoon of the 6th, Zhao Zongzhou, the presiding judge of the Second Criminal Division, opened the trial and summoned the plaintiff, Jiang Lichu, the deceased's fourteen-year-old son, Xiao Ying, the witness Qian Wushi, and the plasterer Wu Baohua to the court for questioning. Jiang Wangshi denied murdering her husband, and Yu Sanbao also claimed that he had hired a plasterer to build a stove at home on November 15th of last year and had not harmed Jiang Qinsheng. However, Xiao Ying recounted that he saw his father lying dead in bed that night, and his mother stopped him from crying out.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping Case Cracked, Victim Rescued</h3>
<p>Qian Songshi's four-year-old grandson, Shui Nan, from Xujiabang, Jiapuqiao in the Suzhou countryside, was kidnapped the other day and a ransom of 4,000 yuan was demanded. The Suzhou-Songjiang Bandit Suppression Command's Detective Team successively arrested the kidnappers Zhou Zheng, Zhou Zhong, and Wang Da at Zhujiayuan and other places, seizing two pistols and rescuing the victim Shui Nan. After questioning, they were sent to the Command for interrogation yesterday (the 7th). (Wuxi)</p>
<h3>Escalating Dispute in the Rice Industry</h3>
<p>Rice and bean businesses in this county have a long-standing practice of offering a 1% rebate (one fen per yuan) for selling grain on behalf of customers. Recently, due to the sharp decline in grain prices, businesses proposed increasing the rebate. A meeting was held on the 20th of last month, deciding to change the rebate from 1% to 1.6%. Zhao Zixin, the executive director of the association, notified all businesses that the change would take effect on July 1st. However, grain businesses in the Beihuangtang and Huangniqiao areas argued that they were not informed in advance and that customers came from afar and could sell their goods along the way. Increasing the rebate would inevitably reduce their sources and lead to sluggish business, which would be equivalent to suicide. Furthermore, the Railway Department recently reduced freight rates to accommodate merchants, so they must maintain the old system of a 1% rebate. Grain businesses in the Sanliqiao area mainly deal in local goods from the surrounding villages, with only a few customers from afar. Therefore, changing the rebate to 1.6% would have no impact on their business and would actually be more beneficial. As a result, they strongly support the change. Currently, the opposing and supporting sides are engaged in intense infighting, each pushing to extremes, and the dispute is escalating. The association has scheduled a meeting of all members at 3:00 PM today (the 7th) to discuss a solution.</p>
<h3>Repeated Accusations Against the Chief of Public Security</h3>
<p>Wu Dexin, the chief of the county's Public Security Bureau, was previously accused of illegal conduct and dereliction of duty by a police officer, You Jun, in a complaint to the provincial government. The provincial government ordered the Department of Civil Affairs to instruct the county government to thoroughly investigate the matter. At that time, Wu Dexin happened to be in the provincial capital and met You Jun at the office of a section chief. He gave You two yuan and asked him to return to Wuxi. After returning, Wu Dexin, considering You's insubordination and defiance of orders, immediately ordered You's detention. You was released after four days. You, believing that Wu Dexin abused his power and oppressed him, collected evidence of recent private settlements in the Donghutang and Washington Hotel smoking cases and filed a complaint with the provincial government, also implicating Jin Shiqi, the supervisory officer of the bureau. Due to the repeated accusations against Wu Dexin, the provincial government has decided to transfer him with the current chief of the Jiangyin County Public Security Bureau, and a formal order is expected soon.</p>
<h3>Young Woman Leans on Balcony and Commits Suicide by Slitting Throat</h3>
<p>Gu Houqing, a shareholder and manager of the Xiecheng Silk Cocoon Warehouse on Gongyun Bridge, is the younger brother of Gu Dasan, a major landlord outside Guangfumen. Houqing has one wife and one concubine. His wife, Zhang, lives in the old house in Xianfengdun. His concubine, Zeng, from Jiangxi, was married when he was a government official in Hubei Province. The other day, Zeng was leaning on the balcony by the window when she suddenly slit her throat with a long-handled Western-style razor. Blood flowed like a river, filling the ground under the window. Her maid saw this and quickly reported it to the family, who carried her to the Brothers Hospital for treatment. Her trachea and windpipe were severed, and there was no hope of survival. The reasons for the suicide are complex. One theory is that Houqing divided the family property unfairly. Another is that she recently fell out with Houqing. A third theory is that Houqing set up a gambling stall like an old sheep stall in front of his house, and Zeng could not drive it away. Instead, she was insulted and scolded, so she decided to die. The authorities are investigating the matter.</p>

<h3>Captain Sun Seizes Pirate Ships</h3>
<p>Captain Sun of the First Squad of the 19th Brigade of the 5th District of the Zhenjiang Water Police, recently received a tip that there were a large number of pirate ships, specializing in theft on the river. There were as many as twenty or thirty ships. He immediately intensified the investigation and seized four pirate ships near Guazhou, arresting the ringleader Zhang Debiao and others. He immediately interrogated them, and they confessed without denying anything. They also claimed that there were twenty or thirty ships specializing in theft on the river, and they had never been caught. Now that they were caught, they were willing to act as informants and lead the arrest of the remaining members, hoping for leniency. Sun, believing that the case was serious, immediately sent them to the District Office for interrogation. After confessing as above, the district inspector, Qin Yucai, was dispatched with Zhang Debiao to investigate and arrest in the Sanya River area. It turned out that the remaining members had gone to Nanjing to divide the loot. They were immediately pursued and arrested, and the accumulated thieves Zhang Dafa, Yu Qifa, Zhao Yunsheng, and Li Chunshan were arrested on Hubei Road in Nanjing. The bandits were dividing the loot at that location when they were all arrested at once. They confessed that the pirate ships were still docked in Sanya River and were seized. Together with all the criminals, they were escorted to Zhenjiang and temporarily detained at the District Office, pending the arrest of the remaining members for joint interrogation. (Yangzhou)</p>
<h3>Dun Ji Pawnshop Submits Request to Cease Operations</h3>
<p>Dun Ji Pawnshop in Shipailou, Yangzhou, submitted a request to the county government to cease pawning and redemption operations, stating that there are only three pawnshops in the city. Currently, Dexin and Fucheng have already submitted requests to the county government to cease pawning and redemption operations due to economic difficulties, as an initial step towards closing down. Therefore, the only pawnshop remaining in the city is Dun Ji, which feels increasingly unable to support itself alone. Therefore, it also submitted a request to the county government, stating the difficulties and requesting to cease pawning and redemption operations.</p>

<h3>Provincial Order to Investigate the Private Compilation of County Political Chronicles</h3>

He has been transferred to the county government for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Audit of Chamber of Commerce Accounts</h3>
<p>The Bengbu Chamber of Commerce previously experienced internal disagreements, with the executive and supervisory committee members resigning one after another, causing the affairs of the chamber to stagnate. The various industry associations generally advocated a thorough reorganization and requested the Anhui Provincial Party Affairs Reorganization Committee to send personnel to supervise the election. More than twenty industry associations and individual stores organized the Bengbu Chamber of Commerce Members' Committee for Auditing Chamber of Commerce Accounts, advocating a thorough audit of the various donations raised by past committee members and all income and expenses, as well as the accumulated membership fees owed by various stores over the years. Since its establishment, the auditing committee has been working diligently for a month. Recently, it was discovered that Xie Dezhao, a donation collector for the chamber of commerce, had embezzled more than 700 yuan of public funds over the years. The matter was severely investigated, and Xie fled without a trace. Subsequently, the guarantors were asked to repay the embezzled funds. In recent days, the committee has been auditing the amount of currency issued by the Zhili-Shandong Army in Bengbu and the accounts of the donations raised for Ma Zhanshan, as well as the accounts of the price-stabilizing bureau run by Sun Yuanfu and others. A shocking report may be released soon.</p>

<h3>Tang Youren Discusses the Current Situation</h3>
<p>Chen Mingshu to Assume Anti-Banditry Work</p>
<p>Dalian Conference Was Conversational in Nature</p>
<p>Tang Youren, Secretary-General of the Central Political Council, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning from Nanjing. When reporters interviewed him at his residence, Tang said that he would be going to Lushan in the next few days to take care of personal matters such as housing, and would return to Nanjing soon after. Regarding the anti-banditry matters, the central government is now adopting a comprehensive encirclement plan, hoping to achieve the effect of "clearing the fields and fortifying the walls," rather than focusing solely on attacking, so as to avoid exhausting the troops and waiting for the bandits to collapse on their own. Chen Mingshu has expressed his willingness to take on the anti-banditry work, and it is expected that he will soon come forward to assist the central government. Tang then explained the nature of the Dalian Conference, considering it to be entirely conversational in nature and not a conference. Therefore, there were only records and no resolutions, and no signatures were required. The issues of the takeover of North China and the aftermath of the war zone are urgent matters. The central government has ordered the Ministry of Finance to allocate one million yuan first to handle emergency relief, and has decided to issue four million yuan in North China war zone rehabilitation public bonds in Tianjin and Peiping, generally guaranteed by North China salt tax revenue, with a term of about three years. After issuance, the funds will be allocated by the Pingjin Rectification Committee and the Hebei Provincial Government according to the situation.</p>

The chairman's platform was on the steps, with the Party and National Flag suspended above and a portrait of Sun Yat-sen in the middle.

<p>(Yu's Report)</p>
<p>Chairman Secretary-General Yu reported, stating, "Today, Mayor Wu is away in Jiangxi on official business and has not returned. I am acting as chairman and giving a brief report. In the six years since the establishment of this government, through the joint efforts of all colleagues, considerable progress has been made in various municipal affairs. However, since the January 28th Incident last year, the people's livelihood has declined and tax revenues have sharply decreased, which has been the greatest blow suffered by this government in the six years since its establishment. Mayor Wu led all colleagues in working hard to restore the war zone and received assistance from community members, and now it has gradually recovered to its previous state. The various municipal constructions in the six years since the establishment of this government cannot be compared with previous years, and the construction of the city center area will be completed soon, and the realization of the Greater Shanghai Plan is just around the corner. This can be reported to the citizens with comfort. It is hoped that the citizens of this city can invest as much as possible in the Chinese area, and the municipal administration of this city will soon be able to keep pace with the concessions."</p>
<p>(Closed for Business)</p>
<p>Yesterday, the municipal government and all its affiliated agencies were closed for one day to celebrate, and business will resume as usual on the 8th.</p>
<h3>French Concession Follows Suit, Suddenly Warns Da Zhonghua Factory</h3>
<p>Trade Association Calls Special Delegates' Conference</p>
<p>Resolves to Petition the Municipal Government to Negotiate with the Municipal Council</p>
<p>Xin Sheng She reports that after the Shanghai Municipal Council ordered the Yiyuan Rubber Factory to suspend operations and then successively warned Tianxing, Dade, Hongda, and other factories to relocate within a time limit, the case has not yet been resolved. Da Zhonghua Factory on Xujiahui Road was also warned by the French Municipal Council yesterday, and the situation is serious. The Rubber Trade Association held a delegates' conference yesterday and will petition the Municipal Government, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Chinese Ratepayers' Association the day after tomorrow (the 10th). Details are as follows:</p>
<p>(Warning to Da Zhonghua Factory)</p>
<p>The Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory on Xujiahui Road in the French Concession has relatively spacious factory buildings and superior equipment compared to other factories. The French Municipal Council suddenly sent a letter to the factory the other day (the content is the same as the Shanghai Municipal Council's warning to Yiyuan Factory), ordering the relocation of the boiler within a time limit, because the Fire Brigade believes that the factory's boiler is prone to causing disasters. After receiving the letter, the factory, finding it impossible to relocate temporarily, reported to the trade association and planned to find ways to improve.</p>
<p>(Trade Delegates Attend)</p>
<p>The National Goods Rubber Industry Trade Association held a temporary delegates' conference at its office at 6:00 PM yesterday. Lu Hanbang of Tianxing, Xue Fuji of Da Zhonghua, Liang Pinqing of the Brothers Factory, Lu Zhiyun of Jiaotong, Wang Shirong of Hongda, Han Yuansheng of Da Zhong, Yu Xingben of Da Zhongyang, Yu Qiusheng of Dade, Zhao Zhihui of Nanhua, Yuan Bingyuan of Xie Kang, Yang Yongnian of Da Zhongguo, Hong Jiugao of Zhengda, Yang Yongnian of Huatong, Mao Yuting of Yisheng, Huang Yongqin of Yiyuan, Huang Zuowen of Italia, Zhengtai, Dahua, Shi Zhishan, Zhang Bolun of Yihe, Wang Yunxing of Dalai, Cao Taosheng of Dasheng, Feng Yunchu of Daxin, Wang Shuyu of Shiye, Yang Weiyin, Gu Zhizhong, Tang Hezhong, Huang Jianqing, and Wan Xuefang attended, chaired by Feng Yunchu.</p>
<p>(Delegates Report)</p>
<p>First, Chairman Feng Yunchu reported the purpose of the meeting. Then, Wang Shirong of Hongda reported the process of receiving the letter from the Municipal Council ordering the suspension of operations. Xue Fuji of Da Zhonghua reported that his factory's equipment was still complete, but it was also ordered by the French Municipal Council to relocate the boiler. Because it was impossible to relocate temporarily, it was currently shelved. Yang Weiyin of Yonghe Factory reported the proceedings of attending the Industrial Safety Association yesterday. Tian Heqing, a representative of the Industrial Safety Association, reported the tasks and elements of the association for its members. A representative of Zhengtai reported that this case should be divided into temporary and permanent solutions. The permanent solution is to quickly reorganize the safety equipment. The temporary solution should be to submit a letter to the Municipal Government stating the difficulties and requesting the Municipal Council not to issue this order before the factory inspection committee is formed, and to designate a representative to report to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association and the Chinese members of the Municipal Council.</p>
<p>(Decision to Petition on a Specific Date)</p>
<p>Then, the discussion began. The chairman proposed that members Hongda, Dade, Yiyuan, Tianxing, and other factories had successively reported that they had recently received letters from the Municipal Council, which, under the pretext that the factory buildings were not suitable, illegally ordered the suspension of operations, causing widespread anger. He asked how to assist them appropriately. It was resolved: 1. Submit a letter to the Municipal Government, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce reporting the proceedings. 2. All member delegates will go to the Municipal Government to petition and request negotiations with the Municipal Council, and temporarily suspend the crackdown before the establishment of the factory inspection committee. 3. Elect Xue Fuji, Feng Yunchu, Shen Mengshi, Shi Zhishan, and Yu Xinsheng as five representatives to report the proceedings to the Municipal Government, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and request assistance. 4. Draft a document, with Cao Zhigong drafted. 5. Decide to gather at the trade association at 10:00 AM on July 10th to depart.</p>
<p>(Municipal Council's Statement)</p>
<p>The Municipal Council's Intelligence Office released a statement yesterday stating that the Shanghai Municipal Council's actions regarding certain rubber factories were based on the Municipal Council's police powers to prevent public danger. It was found that in March of this year, all the workers of a certain rubber factory submitted a petition to the relevant police station, because in view of the accidents at factories such as Zhengtai, the workers were very concerned about the lack of preparation in the factory and requested protection from the police station. The workers stated that they had no ill feelings towards the factory, but had to petition the Municipal Council because it concerned their own safety.</p>

<h3>The Ninth Group of Displaced Overseas Chinese from Mexico Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>A Total of 102 Men, Women, and Children</p>
<p>Left Shanghai This Morning for Hong Kong to Return to Their Ancestral Homes in Guangdong</p>
<p>Of the displaced overseas Chinese from Mexico who have returned to China, there have been eight groups, numbering approximately over two thousand. Yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, a ninth group of 102 displaced overseas Chinese, including men, women, and children, arrived in Shanghai aboard the Dollar Steamship Lines' President Hoover.</p>
<p>(Landing and Parade)</p>
<p>The President Hoover arrived at 8:00 AM yesterday morning and docked at the Dollar Line pier at Bailianjing, Pudong. Representatives from the Global Federation of Chinese Associations, Peng Can-guang, Fang Di-fei, Gu Bing-yan, Gao Qing-yu, Xie Jian-ping, and Chen Han-bin, along with representatives from the Displaced Overseas Chinese Relief Association, Huang Zhu-lin, Lin Wen-li, Zhang Bai-yu, and Lin Hui-yao, a group of over ten people, took a ferry from the Customs Wharf at 6:30 AM to the Dollar Line pier in Pudong to welcome them. Huang Zhu-lin, representing the Relief Association, explained the purpose of the welcome to the overseas Chinese, and after each of the displaced overseas Chinese signed in, they boarded the ferry. At 10:15 AM, they arrived at the Customs Wharf and disembarked. Each of the displaced overseas Chinese held flags and paraded in formation from the Bund to Nanjing Road, and then to the Xinxin Restaurant on Guizhou Road for a rest. As the displaced overseas Chinese passed through Nanjing Road, Chinese and foreign pedestrians stopped to watch, sighing incessantly. The Lianhua Film Company also filmed the procession for publicity purposes.</p>
<p>(Welcome Reception)</p>
<p>The Global Federation of Chinese Associations and the Displaced Overseas Chinese Relief Association held a banquet at the Xinxin Restaurant at 12:00 PM to welcome the displaced overseas Chinese. All of the displaced overseas Chinese attended. Peng Can-guang, the General Secretary of the Global Federation of Chinese Associations, delivered the opening remarks. This was followed by a welcome speech by Wu Deng-yu, Chairman of the Federation. Huang Zhu-lin, Chairman of the Displaced Overseas Chinese Relief Association, reported on the establishment of the Relief Association and its recent activities. Subsequently, Wu Guang-jin and Xue Shi-ming, representatives of the displaced overseas Chinese, reported on the latest anti-Chinese situation in Mexico. They stated that the discrimination against Chinese in Mexico was intensifying, with border checkpoints being closed to prevent Chinese from sneaking across the border, determined to drive all overseas Chinese to their deaths before stopping. The lives and property of the overseas Chinese in Mexico were becoming increasingly dangerous. Unilateral negotiations alone could not save them from this predicament. They hoped that the government would uphold its principle of protecting overseas citizens and adopt appropriate measures to address the situation. They also hoped that the Global Federation of Chinese Associations would act on the spirit of mutual assistance and actively alleviate the suffering of the displaced overseas Chinese. They also thanked the Global Federation of Chinese Associations for hosting the banquet. Zhen Yao-tang, a displaced overseas Chinese, made an impromptu motion to have all the displaced overseas Chinese join the Global Federation of Chinese Associations to fight together, which was unanimously approved with applause. The Global Federation of Chinese Associations also provided each person with a temporary relief fund of ten yuan. The meeting adjourned at around 2:00 PM.</p>

Each of the displaced overseas Chinese intended to return to their hometowns to seek a new life, so they did not stay in Shanghai. Except for Wu Guang-jin and Xue Shi-ming, who were delegated to stay in Shanghai to assist the Displaced Overseas Chinese Relief Association with relief efforts, the rest boarded the original ship again at 7:00 PM yesterday evening to go to Hong Kong, then to Guangdong, and quickly return to their ancestral homes.

<p>Silk factories in the Sixth District of Zhabei, such as Chuxin, Jiyu Xieji, Baotai Shun, Yuanfeng, Yutong, and Fuchang, after being advised by officials of the Sixth District Silk Reeling Industry Union and the industry association to resume work first and await mediation on the night before last (6th), resumed work one after another yesterday morning (7th). About 60% of the workers arrived at the factories. Police officers from the Fourth District Public Security Bureau, as well as various branches and police stations, were also ordered to be fully deployed for protection. The General Bureau, fearing that the police force was insufficient, continued to send the Fourth Police Squadron to assist in maintaining order. Therefore, the situation was as calm as usual at that time. Unexpectedly, around 8:00 AM, a small number of female workers suddenly flocked to the gates of the Wuxing and Hongda silk factories on Changan Road, making disturbances, frantically knocking on the factory gates, and making a lot of noise. As a result, the female workers already working in the two factories were panic-stricken and had no choice but to leave the factory again and stop working. Unexpectedly, the female workers then continued to Chu Xin, Jiyu Xieji, Zhenxing, Mao Feng, Qian Yuan, and Jiyu Shun Ji Factory on Gonghe Road, forcing them to stop working in the same way. As a result, the workers in each of these factories also stopped working and gathered in the Changan Road area, causing great chaos. The police brigades and others managed to disperse them, preventing any accidents. As for Hongchun on Guangfu Road, the South Workshop of Fuchang, and Yuan Ji and Yuan Xing on Yutong Road, fearing being affected, they also automatically stopped working. As for Maoli in Tanjiaqiao, Hongyu and Tiansheng on Liuying Road, Yuanfeng and Yongmei Feng on Hengfeng Road, Dingfeng in Yanjia Ge, and Xinglun and Yufeng in Gujiawan, they continued to work as usual after the union sent people to persuade them, and no accidents occurred.</p>
<p>(Fourth District Still Suspended)</p>
<p>Eleven silk factories in the Fourth District of Zhabei, including Zhengfeng, Xiangcheng, Yuncheng, Yichang, and Yongheng, were deeply concerned that damage would occur after work resumed due to worker conflicts. In addition, some factory workshops originally intended to suspend work for repairs, so it was decided to suspend work for two days for repairs. However, other factories, to avoid misunderstandings among the workers, also decided to suspend work for two days. Therefore, all factories were closed yesterday and scheduled to start work uniformly tomorrow morning (9th). After the suspension of work, the workers all dispersed and lived at home. The Public Security Bureau still sent police to strictly guard against it, and the order was good. It is reported that they must wait for the mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau today and then resume work according to the results.</p>
<p>(Requesting Bail)</p>
<p>Among the female workers in the Fourth District Silk Factory, the seven female workers who caused trouble and were arrested by the Fifth District Third Precinct and sent to the General Bureau, the Fourth District Silk Reeling Industry Union sent people to the Public Security Bureau to request their release but were unsuccessful. Shen Xiao-zuanzi, a worker from Yongheng, was arrested by the Public Security Bureau the day before yesterday. It is said that she was involved in other suspicions. Yesterday, representatives of female workers from factories in Hongkou went to the industry association on Xiaoxi Road to request bail. Zhang Pei-shen and others from the association ordered the workers to jointly request the Public Security Bureau to release them directly. However, the Public Security Bureau decided that the arrested female workers must wait until all the workers have resumed work before they are allowed to be released on bail.</p>
<p>(Association Report)</p>
<p>The silk factory industry association yesterday reported to the Social Affairs Bureau, stating: "Report on the female workers of the Hongkou silk factory making trouble under false pretenses, destroying property, and injuring people, requesting investigation. According to reports from member factories of the association, such as Xiangcheng Silk Factory, in the afternoon of the 5th of this month, the female workers of Zhengfeng Factory suddenly went on strike and flocked to Yongheng Factory and other factories, forcing them to strike. The factories could not dissuade them and had to release the female workers in the factory. However, many pieces of glass had been destroyed in Yifengsheng Factory. Immediately afterwards, they flocked to Xiangcheng Factory and other factories. The factory, fearing disturbances, closed the gate, but the rogue female workers threw bricks and stones, destroying all the glass windows along the street of Xiangcheng Factory, injuring factory worker Lu A'er on the head. The police officers of the Fifth District Third Precinct arrested seven troublemaking female workers and sent them to the General Bureau. On the 6th, the factories advised on the one hand and started work on the other hand. Except for Xiangcheng, Yuncheng, and Yifengsheng factories, which did not start work because the female workers could not gather, the rest went to work in the factories. In this disturbance, no reasons were formally put forward in advance. It is obvious that they were incited and deliberately making trouble. As for the treatment, recently, both labor and management have been able to understand each other and are coordinating the overall situation to discuss solutions, reporting to the bureau for approval and implementation. These female workers are arbitrarily making trouble. If the arrested persons are not punished, how can we warn the cunning and evil and ensure industrial peace? It is reasonable to submit a document for investigation and implementation. The feeling of admiration is overwhelming."</p>
<p>(Mediation Today)</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau is scheduled to conduct mediation at 9:00 AM today in the First Mediation Room of the Bureau in Xiaonanmen. Wang Xian-qing, the director of the Mediation Division of the Third Section, has been designated as the chairman. The silk factory industry association representatives are Zhang Pei-shen, Shen Hua-chen, and Huang Jin-fan. The silk reeling industry in the Third, Fourth, and Sixth districts are represented by Yue Xiao-rong, Chen Xiu-pu, Yuan Yun-long, Wu Su-zhen, and Yang Shu-mei. It is expected that today's mediation may be satisfactorily signed and resolved, because labor and management have independently consulted several times and already have considerable solutions.</p>
<h3>Chinese Cotton Mills Decide to Continue Reducing Working Hours</h3>
<p>The Members' General Meeting Resolved Yesterday</p>
<p>Representatives from Various Places Attended</p>
<p>According to Central News Agency, the Chinese Cotton Mill Federation held a members' general meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday, based on the resolution to reduce working hours on July 1. Representatives from Shanghai, Wuhan, Tianjin, Wuxi, and inland factories attended. All agreed that cotton yarn was cheap and raw cotton was expensive, and business was becoming increasingly difficult. It was necessary to continue to implement reduced working hours. However, the situation in each factory was different. Although the reduction in working hours was unanimously agreed, it was extremely difficult to make a uniform rule on the reduction rate. Therefore, it was resolved that each factory should refer to its own situation to determine the method of reducing working hours. According to reports from the participating factories, the current stock of cotton yarn and cloth in each factory has been greatly reduced compared to the past. It was also heard that all factories must not sell the cotton yarn they produce to the exchange from July onwards. According to the person in charge of the association speaking to reporters, although the reduction rate of working hours in cotton mills across the country is not consistent, and some have not reduced working hours, and some have completely stopped working due to lack of capital, the total number calculated has reached 20%. This means that the initial reduction rate of 23% has been accepted.</p>

<h3>Jiangfeng to Return to Shanghai in a Few Days</h3>
<p>Now Returned to Nanjing from Yueyang</p>
<p>Will Host Reporters After Returning to Shanghai</p>
<p>Zeng Yijing, Director of the Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Office, drove the self-made Jiangfeng aircraft on a long-distance flight along the river. He originally planned to fly to Yichang as the terminal, and then return to Shanghai, but because the upstream water was rising rapidly and the hydroplane had difficulty landing, he was stranded in Yueyang. Now, without waiting for the water to fall, he has flown back to Nanjing, and the flight to Yisha has been cancelled. Zeng is scheduled to return to Shanghai in a few days. According to officials from the office, Director Zeng will host reporters after returning to Shanghai to report on the flight. However, the exact date of arrival in Shanghai has not yet been reported by his telegram.</p>
<h3>Fourth District Water and Electricity Industry Union Clarifies Company Statement</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Electric Power Company's capital side published an article explaining the labor dispute, which the Shanghai Fourth District Water and Electricity Industry Union believed to be inconsistent with many facts, especially fearing that the society would not understand the truth, and specially clarified separately, and recorded the original text as follows: 1. The cause of this labor dispute was that a worker was investigated by Chinese and Western staff, and had committed faults in several jobs and was dismissed, but was still persuaded to resume work. The worker insisted on resigning and, according to regulations, could not enjoy the severance pay. The so-called worker is the head Yang Aqiao, who has always worked very diligently. This dismissal was not a resignation, but was driven out by the Western staff of the capital side. If it was a resignation, why would he ask the union to negotiate for reinstatement? The so-called several faults are also excuses. When a worker is dismissed by the capital side, he should be given severance pay, which has long been stipulated. The capital side wanted to swallow this severance pay, so it often used the excuse that the worker had committed faults to dismiss him. If not, there is no reason to swallow it. The statement that he was still persuaded to resume work is even more absurd. 2. The previous act of Huigong was actually caused by the resentment of all the workers, and could not be confused by one or two people's instigation. This can be seen from the unanimous action of more than 1,000 people in the entire factory. 3. The previous act of strike was not just for one worker. At the same time, another worker named Zhou Genfa died in the factory on official duty. The capital side only gave a pension of 200 yuan. The deceased had parents above and a wife below, and several members of the family relied on his wages to maintain their lives. Now, the mere 200 yuan cannot maintain their lives. The union had proposed a pension of 2,000 yuan, but the capital side firmly refused to allow it. The capital side knew that it could not be justified, so it did not mention it in the labor dispute explanation, which shows its intention to deceive society. 4. The workers are very responsible for social security, so although the entire factory is on strike, some workers are still left to work to avoid power outages. The capital side deliberately confuses this, and its intention is sinister, wanting to make all workers bear the crime of disturbing public order. In short, the capital side intends to instigate a labor dispute, so after the previous strike, the capital side hired more than 100 White Russians, giving them excellent supplies. Today (7th), they dismissed Ni Wenfu, Chen Baogen, Pan Genlin, and worker Zhang Caisheng, who are union directors, to provoke the workers, in order to achieve their determination to dismiss a large number of people and swallow a huge amount of severance pay. Their recklessness is evident.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Plans to Expand Telecommunications Machinery Manufacturing Plant</h3>
<p>Minister of Communications Zhu Jia-hua, in view of the fact that most of the materials needed by the Ministry of Communications are purchased from foreign countries, and the annual exports are countless, decided to expand the Ministry of Communications Telecommunications Machinery Manufacturing Plant established by the Ministry of Communications in Shanghai. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(Current Status of the Plant)</p>
<p>The plant's organization is divided into three workshops, specializing in the manufacture of individual material machines. The first electric workshop specializes in manufacturing telegraph machine parts, the second workshop specializes in manufacturing wireless telegraph machine parts, and the third workshop specializes in manufacturing batteries. However, all the manufacturing raw materials are supplied by imported goods. Therefore, the so-called manufacturing of the plant is only to assemble imported machine parts. However, Yu Ruxin, the director of the plant, has a wealth of knowledge in manufacturing machine parts, but is limited by funds and cannot develop.</p>
<p>(Expansion Plan)</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications has now decided to expand the Ministry of Communications Telecommunications Machinery Manufacturing Plant located in Zhoujiadu, Pudong. The expansion plan has also been decided. It is heard that 4 million yuan will be allocated to expand the plant. One source of the funds is to borrow from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity, and the other is to add commercial shares. Because after the expansion of the plant, various machines such as telegraphs will be manufactured and distributed domestically to save profits.</p>

<p>The China Merchants Bureau's Tonghua vessel, en route from Shanghai to Xiamen, encountered a hurricane in the open sea off Xiamen port some days ago. The ship's captain immediately dropped anchor to take shelter from the wind, but the force of the storm was too strong, causing the cargo of crude oil and other goods loaded on the deck to be swept into the sea.

<h3>Japanese Consulate Police Search for Japanese Anti-Imperialist Representatives</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Japanese-language Shanghai Daily reported that representatives from various countries attending the Anti-Imperialist Conference have been successively departing for Shanghai. According to a special Reuters dispatch, American Ms. Malek Qing and Ms. Aileen Wilkinson have already set out. Other representatives from Canada, the United States, and various countries are following suit. Unexpectedly, three Japanese anti-imperialists, namely Tokunaga, Takaichi, and Sakamoto, have also secretly entered Shanghai and begun to be active in the French Concession. Upon hearing this, the Japanese Consulate police are making every effort to search for these three individuals. It is reported that an important issue to be discussed at the conference is the expansion of the Anti-Imperialist League's Shanghai branch into a Far East branch.</p>
<h3>French Concession Searches for Red Pill Offenders</h3>
<p>Entering Rooms Through Skylights</p>
<p>Startling Women Bathing</p>
<p>The French Concession's Da Ziminzhong (Big Clock) police station dispatched both Chinese and Western detectives on the night shift, along with a truck. They first went to Zhizhong Lane to search for houses illegally selling and consuming red pill drugs. Then they proceeded to the Xingxing Lane intersection of Zilaihuo Street and Cai Shi Street. The detectives guarded the front and rear doors of the lane and entered to search. Men, women, old and young, had no choice but to scramble onto the roofs to escape. The detectives also climbed onto the roofs to pursue them. These people were running around on the rooftops until they reached the Qian Yuanfa house in Fuxing Lane. Seeing that the skylight on the roof of the house was open, they jumped down into the room. It happened that a woman was bathing in the room, and she was greatly startled, screaming "Catch the thief!" Neighbors opened their doors to watch, only to realize that it was people trying to escape the red pill search. Several of them escaped from a balcony, while the others were reportedly captured by the detectives and taken back to the police station for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Economic Pressure Leads Teenager to Commit Suicide by Poisoning</h3>
<p>The Father of the Deceased Requests Exemption from Autopsy</p>
<p>Qian Chongzhi, a local resident, 24 years old, lived at No. 58 Shipilong Lane in the city. He was a Western musician, usually well-behaved and had no bad habits. Recently, due to slow business, he was under economic pressure, making it difficult to maintain his household. Qian developed a pessimistic outlook and, around 5:00 PM the night before, took a bath with copper fishing hooks and poisoned himself. It was not until around 8:00 PM, when a friend of Qian's sent red eggs to his house, that he was discovered. Subsequently, Qian Jun (29 years old), a pharmacist at the Municipal Public Security Bureau's medical office and Qian's older brother, rushed to the scene with Qian's father. They found Chongzhi lying stiff on the bed, already dead. They reported to Shen Zhenhua, the director of the first station of the second district, who dispatched a police officer to investigate and ordered the local security officer to report to the local court for an autopsy. It is reported that the father of the deceased requested the prosecutor to grant an exemption from the autopsy and allow him to arrange for the burial himself.</p>
<h3>Cook Argues with Wife and Attempts Suicide</h3>

Wu was addicted to gambling, leading to severe financial difficulties and mounting debts. His wife often gave him good advice, but Wu's nature was hard to change and to no avail. Last night, Wu wanted to go out to gamble again but was stopped by his wife, leading to an argument. Afterwards, Wu felt resentment and developed a pessimistic outlook, secretly taking a large dose of raw opium to commit suicide. His wife discovered it and rushed him to Renji Hospital for treatment. His life is said to be in danger.</p>
<h3>Wang Zhiya Accused of Embezzlement of Public Funds for Private Gain</h3>
<p>Using Public Funds to Purchase Pigments</p>
<p>Selling at Inflated Prices Through His Own Company</p>
<p>Wang Zhiya (also known as Wang Dudong), a native of Sichuan, studied in the United States in his early years and graduated with a degree in chemistry in 1920, excelling in his field. He was immediately hired by a factory in the United States as a chemist, where he worked diligently and earned the trust of the factory owner. At that time, Wang was only 23 years old, and the factory owner, recognizing him as a promising young man, made an exception and promoted him, with salary increases every year. The factory had a Hengxin Foreign Firm in Guangdong Road, Shanghai, which specialized in selling the factory's pigments. Later, Wang was transferred to the Shanghai branch and given responsibilities equivalent to a Chinese manager, with even better pay. Last year, his salary had increased to over US$370 per month, equivalent to over a thousand Chinese dollars. With his high position and wealth, Wang sought to develop his career and invited his close friends Xi Rungeng and Huang Zuolin to establish the Jiuyuan Company. Initially, it specialized in real estate business, but later it also engaged in pigment trading. On the surface, it was selling goods for Hengxin on commission, but in reality, Wang would pre-order large quantities of pigments before the price was about to rise. When merchants came to the foreign firm to purchase the goods after the price increase, Wang would sell them the pre-ordered goods, with all profits, large or small, going into his own pockets, not to the foreign firm or the company. Over the past three years, his wealth has grown increasingly large. This spring, the foreign manager of the foreign firm, Mr. Carter, came to Shanghai to investigate the business and discovered this situation. He believed that Wang's behavior was tantamount to embezzlement of public funds for private gain and was unacceptable. Therefore, in March, Wang was dismissed. On the one hand, he negotiated with Wang, demanding compensation for the losses. Initially, he demanded 10,000 yuan, then 100,000 yuan, and then gradually reduced the amount from 50,000 back to 10,000 yuan. Letters were exchanged back and forth, lasting three months, but a peaceful resolution was not reached. Mr. Carter has now hired an American lawyer to file a criminal lawsuit against Wang Zhiya in the First Special District Court, accusing him of violating Articles 335, 350, and 363 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Deng opened the trial in court. The defendant also hired lawyer Wu Shougang to defend him. First, Carter stated the background of hiring the defendant, as well as his discovery that the defendant had established a company with others, using the company's name to purchase large quantities of pigments from the foreign firm at low prices, and then reselling them to the plaintiff's customers after the price increase, thereby profiting from it, causing great losses to the plaintiff's business. The court then questioned the exact amount of the losses. The Westerner replied that he had not yet investigated it clearly and could not determine the number. Then, lawyer Ren rose to state that the plaintiff and the defendant had been negotiating for three months. If there was concrete evidence to prove the amount of the losses, it should have been collected long ago. But today, the trial could not be proven exactly, which was nothing more than a joke to the defendant, and it also showed that the plaintiff was merely using criminal litigation to prevent the defendant from leaving. Judge Deng then questioned the defendant briefly and ordered the plaintiff to investigate the amount of the losses and reschedule the trial.</p>
<h3>Merchants and Residents of the Entire Xujiahui Town Petition for the Elimination of Stinking Water from the Pu Zhao River</h3>
<p>The Pu Zhao River in western Shanghai has been silted up for a long time. After the initiative of the elderly Mr. Ma Xiangbo and others, they petitioned the Songhu War Zone Rehabilitation Association to allocate funds for dredging. The municipal government approved it and ordered the Public Works Bureau to invite bids for the work in sections. Dredging has been underway for more than three months. However, the eastern half of the sixth section (i.e., from Pailouwan eastward, passing Tushanwan, Xujiahui, to Jinji Bridge) was stopped due to changes in the municipal government's plan. But the embankments at both ends were built to block the flow, causing the river water to turn black and emit a foul odor, making people want to vomit. It is now known that more than seventy shops, including Zhou Xiangtai, Yang Baokang, Rentang, and Dechangshun in the town, have suffered from the pollution of drinking water, and to avoid epidemics during the summer, they jointly petitioned the municipal government yesterday to take measures to eliminate the pollution and restore public health.</p>
<h3>Lixing Factory Launches New Styles of Various Thermos Bottles</h3>
<p>The Lixing Thermos Bottle Factory on Dongyouheng Road in Shanghai has produced the Great Wall brand of various thermos bottles, which are of excellent quality and maintain the temperature accurately and reliably, and have long been popular throughout the country. In this year of promoting domestic products, the factory has launched a new type of short, wide-mouth water bottle, which not only keeps hot for 24 hours but also keeps cold for up to 48 hours. Recently, the weather has been hot, and the sun has been scorching. People from all walks of life use this type of water bottle to store ice cream and cold food, making it a supreme product that serves two purposes. Therefore, buyers are flocking to it, as if it were on the road to Shanyin, and they are overwhelmed. It is said that the factory's craftsmanship is profound, and it is continuing to actively develop various new and innovative bottles, such as those with spouts and those with capacities of three pounds and five pounds, which will soon be available to meet the needs of society and provide convenience to all sectors. This is truly good news for our industrial sector.</p>
<h3>Mother and Son Come to Shanghai to Seek a Living, Resulting in Tragedy</h3>
<p>Unable to Afford Boat Tickets, Pushed into the River and Drowned</p>
<p>Wang Wanxuan, a woman from Shanxi, was 34 years old this year. Her husband died early, and she lived with her orphaned son Wang Baohua, 14 years old, at No. 14 Jiangjia Lane, Wuhu, relying on needlework to make a living. Recently, due to the high cost of living, they had no rice to cook. So, on the first of this month, they came to Shanghai from Wuhu, intending to find work as servants to make a living. However, they were unfamiliar with the place and had no luck. So, on the evening of the 6th, they returned to their hometown with their son, taking the China Merchants Bureau's Jianguo steamer. Unexpectedly, Wang Wanxuan fell into the river and died. Wang Baohua saw his mother fall into the river in the middle of the night and was driven ashore himself. Seeing the steamer sail away, he cried loudly. The patrolman of the French police station heard the cries and rushed over to inquire. He learned about the incident and notified the water police station to send detective Wang Haiquan to take Wang Baohua to the police station. After investigation by the police chief, it was said that he and his mother were on the Jianguo steamer returning to Wuhu. However, because they did not have a penny to buy tickets, the tea room attendant pushed his mother into the river and drowned her when the ship sailed. The police station, considering that the case involved human life, instructed the rescue bureau to retrieve the body. At 6:00 AM yesterday, the body was recovered under the Jinliyuan Wharf of the China Merchants Bureau. Detective Wang then took the child to the local court to report for an autopsy. After prosecutor Yang and others arrived at the scene and examined the body, they instructed the hall to arrange for burial, and the child was temporarily kept in custody, pending investigation of the steamer's tea room attendant to thoroughly investigate the matter.</p>

<h3>Large Group of Bandits Found to Have Committed Major Kidnapping Cases</h3>
<p>Qiu Guoliang and Ma Yifa Both Redeemed with Large Sums of Money Also Allegedly Assassinated Zhu Zizhong and Attempted to Kidnap a Mr. Li</p>
<p>Detectives Shen Chongli and Shi Enjian, along with detective Bao Shuji, of the Hongkou police station, previously arrested a large number of suspects, including Zhuo Hongzhong, Zhao Yisheng, Liu Yong, Liu Yongting, Ye Yongxiang, Zhu Sifan, Ma Gengsheng, women Zhu Xu, and Bai Guo (wife of a certain detective), at various locations in Hongkou and the French Concession, including No. 200 Yaozhu Road and No. 24 Renji Lane, Ximen Road. They seized three pistols and 203 bullets and handed them over to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. The detectives in charge of the case have now discovered that these individuals, along with accomplices, used weapons to kidnap Qiu Guoliang, the owner of Tianbao Silver House on Guangxi Road near Hankou Road, at 1:10 AM on July 5, 1930. They hid him in the bandit den at No. 32 Mingde Lane, Huanlong Road, French Concession, and held him captive for about ten days. The family prepared 40,000 yuan to redeem him. The defendant Zhuo Hongzhong confessed at the police station that he received 1,600 yuan. They also kidnapped Ma Yifa, the 15-year-old son of Ma Xiangsheng, a resident of Glock Road in the French Concession, at 7:00 AM on May 5 of last year. The Ma family also redeemed him with 30,000 yuan. Zhuo Hongzhong received 1,400 yuan, which was paid by Bai Guo. During the kidnapping, Wu Baosheng was shot and killed. They are also related to the assassination of Zhu Zizhong on December 23 last year at the entrance of Deyuli Lane on Dongyouheng Road. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Zehan continued the trial in the first criminal court. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated the previous situation, saying that the defendants were also planning to kidnap Mr. Li, the owner of Shengtai Pawnshop on Haining Road. In March of this year, the defendants Liu Yong, Zhuo Hongzhong, Zhao Yisheng, and the fugitive Lao Zhou agreed to kidnap Mr. Li to the bandit den at No. 101 Mali Road, French Concession, with Zhu Xu responsible for cooking. However, after the house was rented, Zhao Yisheng wrote a letter to notify Zhu Xu to come to Shanghai from Ningbo. Later, Liu Yong committed another theft and the plan was aborted. The seized letters and other evidence were submitted to the court. However, all the victims were not present today. Only Qiu Guoliang sent lawyer Cheng as his representative to the court. Judge Wu questioned the defendant Zhuo Hongzhong, who confessed that he received 1,600 yuan in the Qiu kidnapping case. In the Ma kid case, Bai Guo gave me 1,400 yuan of redemption money on the second floor of the Xinhuizhong Hotel. He also admitted to participating in the meeting to plan the kidnapping of Mr. Li of Shengtai Pawnshop. The defendants Zhao Yisheng, Liu Yong, and Zhu Xu all gave evasive answers. The defendant Bai Guo denied kidnapping Ma Yifa, saying that her husband was a senior civil servant and would never commit such illegal acts, and hired lawyer Wu Linkun to defend her. The other defendants Liu Yongting, Ye Yongxiang, and Zhu Sifan were all charged with privately possessing military firearms. When Judge Wu questioned Liu Yongting, he claimed that he was fooled by others and also hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him. Finally, the lawyer of the victim Qiu Guoliang stated that the victim had gone to Hong Kong for business and could not be present to testify. He did not know about the redemption money. The court stated that Zhuo Hongzhong's confession was very clear, and the regulations on punishing kidnappers had been abolished. He might as well be present next time to testify and clarify the truth. Judge Wu ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the trial.</p>
<h3>Various Shipping Bureaus Implement Anti-Piracy Measures</h3>
<p>Ministry of Communications Convenes Anti-Piracy Meeting</p>
<p>China Merchants Bureau Sets Up Escort Teams</p>
<p>In the past two months, six sea vessels have been robbed and plundered. After the Shanghai Shipping Association reported to the Central Government, the Ministry of Communications specially convened various shipping agencies and companies in Shanghai to hold an anti-piracy meeting in Beijing. It is scheduled to officially open on the 10th. The representatives of the Shanghai shipping industry have all gone to Beijing, and the anti-piracy measures of the various shipping bureaus are also progressing steadily. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(Meeting to Open on the 10th)</p>
<p>Recently, pirates have become rampant, wreaking havoc on the southern and northern seas. The theft of merchant ships has reached six times in a row, causing anxiety among shipping merchants and passengers. In order to ensure maritime safety, the Ministry of Communications has specially convened the Shanghai Shipping Administration Bureau and various shipping bureaus to hold a sea vessel anti-piracy meeting in Beijing. The order from the Ministry arrived in Shanghai yesterday, instructing various shipping merchants to select responsible representatives to participate in the meeting in Beijing. The China Merchants Bureau, Sanbei, and other shipping companies have appointed representatives such as Shen Jiyun to attend the meeting yesterday, each carrying their proposed anti-piracy opinions and proposals, and are scheduled to leave Shanghai for Nanjing today.</p>
<p>(China Merchants Proposes)</p>
<p>Liu Hongsheng, the manager of the China Merchants Bureau, has submitted a written opinion on sea vessel anti-piracy to the board of directors. It states that maritime robberies have been frequent recently. Sea vessels operate on a regular schedule, carrying passengers, travelers, and goods, which inevitably attracts the attention of pirates. The transportation of cash and banknotes is particularly dangerous, greatly affecting the safety of passengers and crew. Special attention should be paid to the safety responsibilities. In the past, in order to take precautions, passengers were often not carried, resulting in huge business losses. It was found during a survey of anti-piracy facilities at Taikoo that iron fences and iron doors are installed in the ship at all points leading to the observation platform, and each deck is separated by wire mesh. Even if pirates mix into the ship, they cannot threaten the crew. On the one hand, they can seek help. The China Merchants Bureau should also do the same on its ships.</p>
<p>(Equipment of Various Vessels)</p>
<p>The shipping department has drafted anti-piracy equipment plans for the entire bureau's vessels. The sea vessels New Ming, New Feng, Haiyan, Haixiang, Hairui, Jinan, and Jiahe are each equipped with a silver cabin, a hand-held machine gun, eight rifles, and a team of eight guards. The Yangtze River vessels Jiangshun, Jiangan, Jianghua, and Jiangxin are each equipped with a hand-held machine gun and four rifles, with a team of four guards. In total, 88 additional guards have been added. Each person's monthly salary is 14 yuan. In this way, there are three ships in the North Sea and four vessels in the South Sea, plus the four ships on the Yangtze River, totaling the cost of purchasing arms and other anti-piracy expenses. The sea vessels require 29,264 yuan, and the Yangtze River vessels require 27,068 yuan.</p>
<p>(Letter to Banks)</p>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau is incurring this anti-piracy expense and installing silver cabins, etc. for transporting silver coins with various banks. The ships have been carrying passengers for several times and have suffered considerable losses. It is now issuing a letter to the Central, China, and Communications Banks, requesting each ship to subsidize the installation costs of 3,000 yuan, so that the shipping bureau and the bank each have their own benefits. The letter has been issued, and the representatives will take the plan for each ship to the Ministry of Communications to participate in the discussion.</p>
<h3>Zou Xianzhang Swindles and Flees with 20,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Hairdresser Acts as Guarantor</p>
<p>Employees in the Stock Firm All Dismissed</p>
<p>Zhongji Securities Company is located in the Securities Exchange on Sanma Road. The manager of the company is Shen Changgeng, a director of the Securities Exchange, and the assistant manager is Wang Jialu. There are many employees, including the trainee Zou Xianzhang from Wuxi, 18 years old. He joined the company for only three months and his monthly salary was ten yuan. He was recommended by the hairdresser of Shen Changgeng's concubine, so Shen was the sole guarantor. Zou's salary for three months, totaling thirty yuan, was deposited with Shen. On the 30th of last month, the settlement date for the exchange, Zou called the China Industrial Bank early in the morning before the accountant arrived at the company, requesting the payment of 20,000 yuan in cash. The bank instructed its staff to deliver the money to the company. When the accountant and others had not arrived, Zou inspected and received the money, and fled without a trace. When the accountant and others arrived at the company and found out, they reported to Manager Shen. Shen was extremely angry and dismissed all employees in the company, leaving only Assistant Manager Wang Jialu and Ye Ziao. He has now reported the case to the authorities for investigation.</p>
<h3>Merchants and Residents in the French Concession Oppose Tent Tax - Further Report</h3>
<p>丨 Yesterday, Petitioned the Ratepayers' Association for Negotiation 丨</p>
<p>One hundred and thirteen businesses, including Da You Xing Wine Shop, Xing Chi, Yuan Xin Tai, and others, along Bailu Road, Ximen Road, and Cai Shi Road in the French Concession of this city, are greatly troubled by the French Municipal Council's promulgation of tent tax collection methods. The tax is calculated by size, reaching as high as six to ten-odd yuan, which is difficult to bear. They have repeatedly sent letters to the Fourth Branch of the Shanghai Second Special District Federation, requesting them to forward the matter to the Federation of All Associations and negotiate with the French authorities. It is reported that the French Municipal Council considers this tax collection method to have been approved by the board of directors and included in the budget, making it inconvenient to change. After several delegations, the Council agreed to submit the matter to the board of directors for review. However, a solution has not yet been reached. The businesses, etc., have stated that recently, the police have repeatedly sent officers to each household to coerce the payment of taxes and to arbitrarily impose penalties. Therefore, yesterday, one hundred and thirteen businesses jointly signed and sealed a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the French Concession, requesting a petition for negotiation. The original letter is quoted below:</p>
<p>"Dear Sirs, We, the merchants and residents, have been conducting business in the French Concession for many years. Every summer, we erect cloth awnings in front of our shops to avoid the heat of the sun. For several years, there have been no incidents. Unexpectedly, this year, the French Municipal Council has specially promulgated a tent tax, calculated by size, with taxes reaching at least five or six yuan to more than ten yuan. We believe that this huge tax is indeed unbearable, so we have politely refused to pay it. Unexpectedly, the French authorities are unwilling to consider the difficulties of the businesses and are insisting on their own way. Recently, the police have sent officers to each household to coerce the payment of taxes and to arbitrarily impose penalties. We believe that the erection of awnings, hanging in front of the shops, is very high off the ground, not only does it not hinder traffic, but it also facilitates pedestrians. Moreover, they are only used for no more than two months, except on windy, rainy, or dark days. It is truly an illegal and harsh tax to collect such a huge amount of tax in this short period. We are determined not to recognize it. We believe that your association is a group of Chinese ratepayers, and you will naturally protect the interests of Chinese ratepayers. Therefore, we jointly appeal to you to promptly negotiate with the French Municipal Council and strive to abolish this illegal tent tax, so as to reduce the burden and relieve the plight of the merchants. We eagerly await your response."</p>
<h3>Enthusiastic Participation of National Silk Manufacturers, Exhibition Hall Greatly Expanded</h3>
<p>Since the preparations for the Chinese National Silk Exhibition began and the call for exhibits was made, the participating manufacturers have been very enthusiastic. As a result, the originally designated third-floor exhibition hall in the Commodity Exhibition Hall of the Municipal General Chamber of Commerce was insufficient. The fourth floor of the hall has also been opened for exhibition use. Yesterday, the arrangement team dispatched personnel to provide guidance. A pine and cypress archway has been erected at the entrance of the National Goods Market, with large wooden characters "Chinese National Silk Exhibition" embedded in the middle. Electric torches are placed on all four sides, making it dazzling at night. Regarding the layout of the exhibition hall, the staff designated by each manufacturer are racking their brains to make beautiful decorations. All kinds of new national silk fabrics are available, allowing visitors from all walks of life to see them all at a glance. A pine and cypress archway has also been erected at the main entrance of the Municipal General Chamber of Commerce, surrounded by electric torches. Red and green colored silks are hung everywhere inside the gate. A white cloth banner is hung in the center, reading "All Imported Clothing Materials Are the Great Enemy of National Silk Fabrics." A couplet hangs on the pillars, reading, "Promoting national silk fabrics is the key to solving people's livelihood problems; Buying foreign clothing materials is the last resort for economic suicide." There is also a couplet at the entrance, reading "National Clothing Please Come In, Foreign Clothing Run Away." Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, also has a couplet, reading, "Bestow on us brocade and silk to prepare for the unexpected, display its achievements, and learn from the masses." Dozens of satirical oil paintings from the Academy of Fine Arts are hung on both sides, alerting the viewers. The Great Hall of the Chamber of Commerce is used as a entertainment venue, performing new plays and comedies to promote national products. A cloth banner is hung high in the hall, along with dozens of slogans, such as "Loving national products is promoting economic prosperity," "Buying foreign goods is heading towards suicide," etc. Boy Scouts maintain order outside the venue. The fourth floor serves as a Red Cross ambulance team. Due to the hot weather these days, there are fears of accidents. If visitors become ill from the heat, the team will provide immediate medical assistance.</p>
<h3>Telegraphs in North China War Zone Restored in Xugezhuang and Tangshan</h3>
<p>Ministry of Communications Orders High-Speed Machines in Hopes of Speedy and Accurate Service</p>
<p>Implementing Joint Telephone and Telegraph Communications on Branch Lines</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency met with Ren Huashi, a business representative of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, this morning. He was informed of the arrangement of telegraph trunk lines, implementation of joint telephone and telegraph communications on branch lines, restoration of telegraphs in the North China War Zone, and the purchase of high-speed telegraph machines. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(Arrangement of Trunk Lines)</p>
<p>There are eight major telegraph trunk lines: Shanghai-Hankou, Shanghai-Fuzhou, Shanghai-Qingdao, Yantai-Jinan, Pinghan, Hanyu, Xiang-E, and Fu-Guang. In order to improve communication efficiency, the Ministry of Communications has dispatched commissioners to carry out arrangements. A special director is responsible for each trunk line. By the end of last month, the initial arrangement of each trunk line has been completed. Telegraph communications on each line are smooth. It is planned that in the second half of this year, after purchasing materials arrive in Shanghai, further arrangements and improvements will be made to ensure accurate and fast communication.</p>
<p>(Purchase of New Machines)</p>
<p>In order to arrange telegraphs, the Ministry of Communications has ordered over twenty Creed high-speed telegraph machines and printing machines from the United Kingdom. It is expected that they will arrive in Shanghai in two months. At that time, they will be installed and used on major trunk lines. At the same time, arrangements will be made. After installation, it is expected that manual labor can be reduced and errors avoided. As for the Fuzhou-Chongqing line, the wires are easily damaged during the hot summer months. After dispatching personnel to repair it, it is already smooth.</p>
<p>(Joint Communications)</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications has decided to implement joint telephone and telegraph communications on branch lines. Each province will have a commissioner in the long-distance telephone administration bureau. Those who have already been appointed are from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Anhui, and Hubei provinces. The Jiangsu commissioner is Liu Songchou, stationed in Zhenjiang. The Hubei commissioner is stationed in Hankou, the Zhejiang commissioner in Hangzhou, the Shandong commissioner in Jinan, and the Anhui commissioner in Anqing. They are actively carrying out their work. Once completed, it can be implemented.</p>
<p>(Restoring the War Zone)</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications has appointed Commissioner Peng Yuyi to restore communications in the North China War Zone. He is directing the work of employees. This morning, the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau received a telegram stating that the telegraph bureaus in Xugezhuang and Tangshan have been restored. The distance from Tianjin to Tanggu is 73 li, Tanggu to Lutai is 79 li, and Lutai to Tangshan is 76 li. Repairs are currently being made to the telegraph lines in Kaiping and Luanzhou. It is expected that they will be restored in sequence after the Japanese troops withdraw on the 10th of this month. As for the restoration of Beidaihe, Taihuangdao, and other places, it will depend on the circumstances of the Japanese withdrawal. In short, the Ministry of Communications is determined to do everything possible to restore them to facilitate communication.</p>

<h3>Jin Genfa Attacks Romantic Rival with Cleaver</h3>
<p>Two Romantic Rivals Meet Unexpectedly</p>
<p>Zhu Lao Si Suffers Unexpected Misfortune</p>
<p>Zhu Lao Si, from Shaoxing, is 50 years old and lives at No. 14 Nanxing Lane, Kangti Road. He works as a jade carver. More than ten years ago, he became acquainted with Wang A'da, a woman from Changzhou, and they lived together on Kangti Road. Wang is now 37 years old, and her relationship with Zhu Lao Si is quite good. However, Zhu Lao Si felt that he was reaching the age of knowing his destiny and feared that it would be difficult for him to grow old with A'da. Last year, he gave her some money and instructed her to remarry, and asked Shi Yongchun and Mother He Shang to act as matchmakers. She remarried to Jin Genfa, a man from Songjiang (now 36 years old), and they lived together in Songjiang. Unexpectedly, Jin Genfa was an unemployed loafer who did not work. Over the years, he has pawned off the clothing and accessories that Zhu Lao Si gave to Wang A'da. Wang A'da saw that the person she married was a scoundrel and resented it every day. She also felt that Zhu Lao Si's feelings were deep and sincere, so she secretly ran away to Shanghai last month and returned to Zhu. Zhu, remembering their old love, still lived with her. Jin Genfa, after losing his wife, inquired everywhere and learned that Wang was still with Zhu. He harbored resentment in his heart, but he could not prove it because he could not find Wang. At about 8 o'clock yesterday morning, Zhu Lao Si went to No. 1 Dexing Lane, Gordon Road to visit a friend. Unexpectedly, as soon as he entered the door, he saw Jin Genfa in the room. Zhu immediately turned around to leave, but Jin Genfa had already seen him. When the romantic rivals met, they were especially jealous. Jin Genfa grabbed a cleaver from the table and slashed Zhu Lao Si's head four times. Zhu immediately fell to the ground, unconscious. Fortunately, Zhu's friend and neighbors called the police at No. 143 Putuo Road. Zhu was taken to Renji Hospital for treatment, but his injuries were very serious and his life may be in danger. The murderer Jin Genfa has been detained for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Aviation Highway Lottery Prize Collection Procedure is Simple</h3>
<p>Prizes in This City are Issued by the Office</p>
<p>Prizes in Other Cities are Issued by Various Banks</p>
<p>The National Government's Aviation Highway Construction Lottery has a total of 50,665 prizes. The draw is only a few days away. The question of what the procedure for collecting prizes is and where to collect them is what the people of the country want to know. Yesterday, someone drove to the lottery office on Edward Road and met with a certain important official in the office and had the following conversation: (Q) When will the first round of winning lottery tickets begin to be awarded? (A) Prizes will be awarded seven days after the draw. The effective period for awarding prizes is from August 7 to January 30, 1934. (Q) Where can prizes be collected? (A) Prizes can be collected at the lottery office on Edward Road. (Q) Is it necessary to go through the various distribution points and management offices first to collect prizes? (A) There is no need to go through any management offices, because each management office must return all the money and ticket stubs from the sold tickets to our office by the end of this month. Therefore, when collecting prizes, there is no need to go through the verification procedures of the various distribution points or management offices. (Q) Is the procedure for collecting prizes complicated? (A) It is extremely simple. The winner only needs to bring the ticket to our office, and our office will return a copper token. After about a few minutes of verification, the prize money can be issued. (Q) Will handling fees or other commissions be deducted when issuing prize money? (A) Absolutely not. The prize money is issued in full cash by the office. (Q) Other cities are far from Shanghai. Do winners have to come to Shanghai to collect their prize money in person? (A) Our office is currently in contact with major banks and plans to entrust the branches in various places to issue prize money on our behalf. Generally, prizes below the eighth prize can be issued by the branches of major banks. For prizes above the seventh prize, for the sake of prudence, the banks may need to mail the winning lottery tickets to our office. After our office verifies them, we will notify them to issue the prize money. (Q) How have the ticket sales been in this city in the past few days? (A) There are more than 200 lottery ticket distribution points in this city. Since this month, the average daily sales have been over 10,000 tickets. The number of lottery tickets currently in stock is small. It is estimated that all of them will be sold out before the draw.</p>

<h3>Lu Jilin Accused of Seducing a Minor</h3>
<p>Wu Lin, a widow from Anqing, Anhui, had three children with her husband when he was alive. Now only the eldest daughter, Xiaofeng, is left, and the rest have died prematurely. Therefore, the mother and daughter depended on each other. Xiaofeng, now 19 years old, was engaged to Zhu Sanmao, a fellow villager, as a child bride when she was 15 years old. They were the same age, childhood sweethearts, and loved each other very much. Until the Yangtze River flood two years ago, Anqing was the first to bear the brunt. The fields were in ruins. Mrs. Lin, starving and exhausted, took Xiaofeng to Shanghai, intending to make a living with her ten fingers. They first lived in a three-story building of the Tong Shantang pharmacy on Xie Xu Road in the French Concession. Later, someone introduced Xiaofeng to work as a worker in the Xieqiao Gongxing Sock Factory. Lu Jilin, a shareholder and engineer of the factory from Shaoxing, saw that Xiaofeng was weak and could be bullied. Before long, he seduced her into adultery. Last year, the factory closed down due to poor business. In October, Lu even instigated Xiaofeng to elope to Shaoxing and held a wedding with Xiaofeng with lightning speed. However, Mrs. Lin did not know what happened until she recently learned the truth after her beloved daughter went missing. Therefore, on the 12th of this month, she</p>

<h3>Summer Vacation Homework Zone</h3>
<p>We want to take advantage of this summer vacation to make the following contributions to young friends in various schools: 1. We have opened a special column in this newspaper as a homework zone for young friends during the summer vacation, hence the name "Summer Vacation Homework Zone." 2. We have invited several relatively cultured researchers to be the instructors for this column and hope that young friends will participate in this pioneering work themselves. 3. The instructors' work plan is roughly as follows: (A) Discussing the current social and life problems, school life problems, and student study problems raised by young friends to encourage everyone to discuss them with each other. (B) Proposing a research outline on a certain science, or proposing important problems or theories published in a certain famous work, to encourage everyone to discuss them. (C) Providing consultation for young friends. If young friends have any questions or difficulties, they should analyze and answer them wherever they can. 4. The scope of young friends' homework is roughly as follows: (A) Everyone should consciously liquidate the lessons learned in school in a semester. What are their insights? What do they not understand? What do they disagree with? Try to publish them as much as possible. (B) Everyone should truthfully describe the experience gained in this semester from the education and management of the school and make fair criticisms based on their own observations. What should be promoted? What should be reformed? (C) What do young friends plan to do during this summer vacation, how to do it, and why do they do it? However, here we must declare that we are not writing articles, but talking nakedly. We will not use classical Chinese. Everyone should tell the truth and not make deceitful remarks. It is not possible to attack people intentionally.</p>

<p>Dear Editor, Having read the news in your newspaper about the silk factory strikes, it mentioned that the Fengtai Silk Factory in Dayang Bridge, the Yutai Silk Factory in Tanziwan, the Maoli Silk Factory in Tanjia Bridge, and the Xinglun Silk Factory in Gujiawan also experienced strikes at the same time. After investigation, none of these silk factories experienced strikes yesterday. Therefore, we respectfully request a correction. Sincerely, Shanghai Sixth District Silk Reeling Industry Workers' Union, July 7.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, In today's news in your newspaper about my return to the country to solicit goods, there is a sentence that says "there are no commercial officers in that country," which is quite inconsistent with the facts. Because Siam has not signed a commercial treaty with our country, there are no diplomatic officials such as ministers and consuls. As a result, the import of native products from that country to our country cannot be certified. Last year, our government sent Mr. Zhu Hexiang, Director of the International Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to Siam to negotiate with the government of that country. It was agreed that the Central Government would appoint Mr. Chen Shouming, Chairman of the Siam Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, as our country's commercial commissioner in Siam to preside over the certification of goods. He officially took office on New Year's Day this year. I am sincerely afraid that the rumors are false, so I am even more</p>
<p>As above, I hope it will be published in the letters column to clarify the truth. Yours sincerely, Wang Mingfu, July 7.</p>

<h3>Sun Yat-sen Cultural and Educational Center Seeks Biographies of Sun Yat-sen</h3>
<p>First Prize: 5,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Second Prize: 3,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Sun Yat-sen Cultural and Educational Center, in view of the fact that there is no perfect biography of Sun Yat-sen on the market, the Board of Directors decided to extract a prize of more than 10,000 yuan to publicly solicit biographies. The center's planned origins and rules are recorded as follows: Origins: Sun Yat-sen is a great revolutionary leader, a great thinker, and also a great man of the world. In the struggle of thousands of hardships and unyielding, he single-handedly created the Republic of China and single-handedly divided the period of history. His great personality and spirit are forever active in his immortal cause, and his great thoughts will forever remain in his legacy. Of course, words cannot commemorate or extol this great figure. However, all world-famous figures in history have detailed biographies of their lives. In order to leave a model for future generations and to provide young people with good model reading materials, the center believes that a perfect biography of the teacher's thoughts, personality, and career is necessary. Therefore, the center is now specifically seeking the teacher's biography, making an active and faithful description of the teacher's life, and at the same time making a detailed description of the teacher's environment and background at that time, so that young people can admire and learn from him. We believe this work is the most meaningful, and we sincerely hope that writers from all over the country will come to participate enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Solicitation Rules: 1. Topic: "Biography of Sun Yat-sen"; 2. Style: New literary style; the writing must be vivid, and the description must be faithful; 3. Number of words: 60,000 to 200,000 words; 4. Manuscript paper: Any kind of paper can be used, and the number of lines is not limited, but it must be well-bound. The end of the article must be personally signed and stamped so that the prize can be collected based on this after the announcement; 5. Submission: The deadline is July 31, 1934; 6. Prizes: First place: 5,000 yuan in cash; second place: 3,000 yuan in cash; third place: 1,500 yuan in cash; fourth to sixth places: each will be given a book coupon worth 100 yuan; seventh to tenth places: each will be given a book coupon worth 50 yuan; the rest will be given a commemorative badge.

Announcement: The center will hire seven members to form a committee to review and determine the ranking. The announcement will be made at the end of 1934; 8. Application: Applicants should first send a letter to the center to request a registration form, which should be filled out and mailed to the center by registered mail before September 30 of this year.</p>
<h3>University Association States Difficulties for Ministry of Education's Enrollment Restrictions</h3>
<p>Executive Committee Meeting Held Yesterday</p>
<p>The University Joint Association held its 21st [missing text] executive committee meeting at [missing text] on the eighth floor yesterday afternoon. Attendees included Jiaotong [missing text], [missing text] Suo Gong, Shanghai University Zhang Chunjiang, Fudan Jintongjun, Da [missing text] Lei [missing text] Neng, Datong Cao Liang [missing text]. The agreed-upon cases are: 1. The current enrollment problem for each university. The high school entrance examination has not yet ended, and the current enrollment will still be handled as usual. 2. Recommend Zhu Gongjin to contact and entertain the meeting of the Chinese Physical Society. 3. Elect the next term of staff, with Guanghua as the chairman, Fudan as the secretary, and Datong as the accountant.</p>
<p>In addition, the association's joint association presented a document to the Ministry of Education stating the difficulties of restricting enrollment: The Ministry's Order No. 4718 states that current university education emphasizes humanities and ignores production, so it wants to restrict the number of new students in the liberal arts colleges in order to cultivate a large number of practical science talents, which is a very good intention. It is undoubtedly necessary for our country to have science and engineering talents, but whether liberal arts talents are sufficient based on the proportion of land and population also seems to be undetermined. The fact that careers are undeveloped and distribution is uneven is no different from science and engineering talents. It is probably not entirely appropriate to call it surplus. I will not discuss this for the time being, but the four measures set by the Ministry seem difficult to follow. Please state them in detail. The affiliated schools have always adhered to the principle of teaching students according to their aptitude in each enrollment. Newcomers may not be divided into colleges or departments. During the half-year or one-year period, they will examine their interests and verify their levels. Those who are suitable for this and not suitable for that will be allowed to transfer to other departments. Those who voluntarily request to transfer to other departments also exist. After one or two years, those with mediocre qualifications or bad habits will be asked to withdraw from school. Those who voluntarily request to suspend their studies also exist. In recent years, due to internal strife, foreign troubles, natural disasters, and man-made disasters, there are even more people who cannot complete their four-year careers. I am very concerned about this. Therefore, the number of graduates from each college and department cannot be measured by the number of new students. The Ministry has records, and a check will reveal it. Those who do not divide into colleges and departments in the first grade are even more incomparable. This is one of the difficulties in following the measures. The affiliated schools recruit new students based on their academic level. For example, if high school graduates applying to universities are better at writing than mathematics and science, there will be more liberal arts students than science and engineering students. If we follow the measures set by the Ministry, students who can be cultivated in liberal arts are more numerous than those in science and engineering, but they are rejected, which is unreasonable. Students with poorer engineering degrees are less numerous than liberal arts students, and they are reluctantly accepted, which is a matter of indiscriminate blame and indulgence. This is the second difficulty in following the measures. As for the way to reform, there are fundamental measures. The association is willing to offer two more opinions to the Ministry: The first is to open up new sources. High school students have not yet determined their ambitions. It is easy to induce and encourage them to show them the importance of practicality and the contempt for writing, to inform them of the pursuit of knowledge and its application, to broaden their horizons through observation, and to practice their minds and hands through experiments. Once their interests are strong and their trends can be determined, they will think that learning liberal arts is boring and will not move forward. This is what the Ministry needs to plan for middle schools. The second is to dredge the flow. The Ministry has counted the number of liberal arts, science, and engineering students nationwide, and the affiliated schools are equally saddened by the disparity in their numbers. However, since recent years, internal and external troubles have multiplied, and we have not been able to accumulate energy to show results. Science and engineering talents have no way to invest, and some are drifting into other careers. Students study for the sake of serving the country and making a living. If the government can determine the funds for agriculture, industry, forestry, and mining, recruit talents, and earnestly organize them, the upper level will seek with sincerity, and the lower level will respond with sincerity. Fathers will tell their sons, and brothers will encourage their brothers to make a living for themselves and serve the country, shoulder to shoulder, and come out in agriculture, industry, forestry, and mining. What else can be doubted? This is what the Ministry needs to suggest to the government. If the students in the affiliated schools have a considerable foundation in applied science when they come, and they can have considerable work in applied science when they leave, the students will each perform their abilities, and it will become a trend. The affiliated schools will praise them, and why fear the flourishing rule? If we do not try hard now, but force it, it will be obstructive and unhelpful. I hope that the Ministry will observe the two difficulties, adopt the two suggestions, and change the previous order so that the affiliated schools can enroll students according to the level of the applicants and the school's facilities, and make appropriate adjustments. Those schools that also have science and engineering colleges should train students after they enter the school and, within the possible scope, enable them to study more science and engineering subjects in order to fulfill the Ministry's good intention of respecting practical learning. Three or four years later, if the two suggestions mentioned above are implemented in earnest, the statistics on the number of liberal arts, science, and engineering students nationwide will not be reversed compared to today, but will be balanced. The Ministry's pursuit is in this. I cannot help but be panicked and await orders. Respectfully presented to the Minister of Education, Wang.</p>

<h3>Primary School Principals' Luncheon Meeting</h3>
<p>Over 50 Schools Have Joined</p>
<p>Among the public and private primary schools in this city, numbering no fewer than several dozen, principals Wu Zhiqian, Zhang Zhonghuan, Cui Jianwu, Shen Xibin, Feng Yixian, Lu Xirong, Zhu Zhiyun, Chen Jicheng, Lu Tiemin, and Shen Junyang from over fifty schools including the Shanghai Girls' High School Affiliated Primary School, Guangxia Affiliated Primary School, Daozhong Affiliated Primary School, Shanghai Primary School, Chongshi Primary School, Zhicheng Girls' School, Zhiyi Primary School, Xin Qun Primary School, and Xinghua Primary School, have initiated the organization of a primary school principals' luncheon meeting to discuss improving teaching methods and developing school affairs. Once preparations are complete, it will be formally established on a scheduled date.</p>
<h3>Chengzhong's Former Principal Ge's Statement on the Hiring of Faculty and Staff</h3>
<p>A Defense to the School Board's Statement</p>
<p>Former Principal Ge Zulan of the Private Chengzhong Middle School sent a letter stating: "Dear Editor, the article 'Chengzhong School Board's Statement on the Compensation for Terminated Faculty and Staff Salaries' published in your newspaper on July 6th involves me in many aspects. As the former principal, I must make four points: ㈠ I submitted my resignation to the school board on July 10th of the 20th year, and it was not approved until August 4th. Two days later, the school board members accompanied the new principal Li to the school to take over. I immediately handed over the affairs, including over fifty copies of the already signed employment contracts, and stated on the spot, 'These were signed in late June, following the school's old practice.' The contracts are dated 'August 1st of the 20th year,' but this is also Chengzhong's old practice, and the actual delivery date was indeed in late June. I have receipts, mimeographed official letters, and my own written records in the school's daily log to prove it. Furthermore, I had mentioned this matter to a few school board members, so some of them were aware of the details. There was no need to wait for the Education Bureau's instruction on August 18th of the 21st year to know that they were issued in late June, nor was it necessary to wait for the judgments of the High Court and the Supreme Court to know what to follow. ㈡ The school board's letter stated that 'Former Principal Ge submitted his resignation in June of the 20th year, and suddenly hired all faculty and staff for the next semester.' I, Zulan, have never done anything 'suddenly.' Chengzhong has sixty to seventy faculty and staff members, and each employment contract has an original and a copy. Not only does writing them take time, but the preparation work before writing also takes considerable time. The teaching hours and salaries of each faculty and staff member for the next semester must be decided one by one before they are sent. Therefore, this set of employment contracts was started around June 10th. At this time, the school board and I had no disagreements on administrative matters, and of course, school affairs should not be suspended midway. (3) Since some members of the school board knew the details of my sending the employment contracts, there was no room for doubt about them. However, now reading the school board's letter, it is known that the school board had many doubts about the employment contracts. If there were doubts, why, after I submitted my resignation on July 10th, did they repeatedly try to retain me through the school's owner's wife, twice through letters, once in person, and also ask Mr. Shi Jinsheng to retain this 'person of questionable character' as principal to continue running the school? (4) The letter stated that 'The school's hiring and firing of faculty and staff has always been the authority of the principal and academic dean, and the school board generally does not interfere.' This is also not true. I have evidence in my possession, but I do not wish to disclose it. Finally, there is one more thing I must state in passing. Initially, some friends advised me to announce the circumstances of my resignation to the public. I did not want my personal departure to affect the reputation of my alma mater, as Chengzhong is my alma mater and I have served there since the founding of the Republic until the 20th year. Therefore, before handing over, I did not mention this matter to my colleagues in the school, and after handing over, I never wrote an announcement to the public. There are many enlightened people in society who do not need me to explicitly state the reasons for my abandoning my alma mater, where I served for twenty years, and going to Xinlu to know that there were compelling reasons. Ge Zulan, July 7th."</p>
<h3>The Sino-French Institute of Technology After the Fire</h3>
<p>Repairing the Burned Buildings and Equipment</p>
<p>Last month, on the 11th, the offices of the president, academic affairs, and student affairs of the Sino-French National Institute of Technology caught fire simultaneously. Fortunately, the rescue was swift and no major disaster occurred. However, some of the office furniture, equipment, floors, etc., were burned. Afterwards, the French Concession Police Department sent many detectives to investigate, believing that there was arson. They interrogated all faculty, staff, and students, but to no avail. The school's president, Chu Minyi, happened to be in Hunan at the time and rushed back upon hearing the news. In addition to reporting to the Ministry of Education, he also strictly rectified the internal affairs and intensified the investigation of the arsonist. At the same time, school affairs continued as usual and were not suspended as a result. The annual examinations have now been completed and summer vacation has begun. The school's fire insurance is contracted by the French company Baotai Insurance Company, which has hired workers to repair the school buildings and has fully compensated for the loss of various equipment and books. It is said that the repairs are nearing completion.</p>
<h3>The Founding of the Zhaohe Middle School</h3>
<p>In 1915, the Zhaohe warship mutinied, marking a glorious page in the history of the revolution. Therefore, the central government has designated a holiday to commemorate it every year to commend its achievements. However, although the aftermath of the martyrs has been arranged, the commemoration of their great deeds is still lacking. Central and local party, government, and military leaders such as Sun Ke, Chen Lifu, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Qun, Wu Xingya, and Yang Hu, in view of this, proposed the establishment of Zhaohe Middle School last winter, hoping to nurture talents and commemorate the great cause. They widely raised funds, extensively planned the layout, recruited aspiring young people, and provided them with rigorous and practical knowledge and skills training. At the same time, they also tried to accommodate the descendants of the Zhaohe and other revolutionary uprisings, as well as the martyrs of the Northern Expedition and the Anti-Japanese War, granting them reduced or free tuition and preferential treatment. The intention is particularly good, and more than thirty military and political leaders from various provinces and cities have expressed their support, and unanimously instructed Mr. Yang Hu, the current Security Director of this city, and Mr. Jia Botao, who personally experienced this battle, to be responsible for the preparations. After more than half a year, the preparations were completed, and the school building was located at No. 476 Haige Road, the intersection of Fukaissen Road. The address is quiet and most suitable for studying. It is said that enrollment has begun.</p>
<h3>McLaren Middle School Actively Improves</h3>
<p>Newly Hired Many Teachers</p>

It will be divided into three levels, A, B, and C, with a one-year study period, and will only accept young men and women who have graduated from senior high school, junior high school, primary school, or have equivalent qualifications. Classes will begin on September 9th. The middle school department will hold new student entrance examinations on the 12th and 13th of this month, and classes will begin on September 1st. The newly hired teachers for the next term include Mr. Xiu Zhongcheng, a lecturer at Oxford University in the UK with a Master of Arts degree, Mr. Lai Puwan, a Bachelor of Science from Cambridge University in the UK, and Ms. Han Lusi, a Master of Arts from Columbia University in the United States. There are also four or five new teachers who have graduated from universities in Germany, Japan, and China. It is said that a few alumni recently attacked the school, but this has now been completely resolved.</p>
<h3>Vocational Educator Guo Yangyuan Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Vocational educator Guo Yangyuan has a profound understanding of vocational education. Two years ago, he was hired by the board of directors of the Qingdao Minsheng National Goods Model Factory to serve as the factory's manager. Later, the factory was transferred to the city's management, and the current Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie still asked Mr. Guo to serve as the factory director. Due to effective management, the factory had a considerable surplus last year. It is said that Mr. Guo has now resigned from his position as factory director and came to Shanghai from Qingdao yesterday. He will return to Beijing within days and continue to engage in vocational education.</p>

<p>National Sports Advancement Conference Decision</p>
<h3>The Main Zone of the National Regional Football Tournament Should Subsidize the Visiting Zone's Travel Expenses</h3>
<p>| Formulating a Table of Subsidies and Notifying All Zones |</p>
<p>Western China Requests to Hold the Next Tournament in Sichuan</p>
<p>Funds Have Been Raised to Subsidize Travel Expenses for All Zones and Welcome Participation</p>
<p>The National Sports Advancement Association Notifies All Zones to Seek Agreement</p>
<p>The National Regional Football Championship began in 1926. The tournament has been held seven times, but each time, various regions across the country have been unable to fully participate due to the current situation or lack of funds. In reality, only two or three teams or three or four teams have participated each time, which is a great regret. Therefore, at the seventh regional tournament held in Wuchang this year, representatives from various regions discussed and decided on a remedial measure: the organizing region (main zone) should subsidize the travel expenses of each region. After deliberation by the board of directors of the National Sports Advancement Association, the amount of subsidies from the main zone to each region has been notified to all regions. Furthermore, the Western China region has requested to hold the next tournament in Sichuan and has raised funds to subsidize the travel expenses of each region, sincerely welcoming teams from all regions to participate in Sichuan. The National Sports Advancement Association specifically notifies all regions to seek agreement. The details are recorded as follows.</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Seventh Representatives Meeting</h3>
<p>Each Tournament, Regions Cannot Fully Participate</p>
<p>Remedial Measures Should Be Sought to Meet the National Name</p>
<p>Minutes of the Seventh National Regional Football Tournament Representatives Meeting. Location: Hubei Education Department, Wuchang, Central China. Date: April 21, 1933, 10:00 AM. Attendees: Chairman: Zhou Jiaqi (Representative of the National Sports Advancement Association), Recorder: Song Ruhai (Honorary Secretary of the Association), Feng Jianwei (Eastern China), Zhang Lirong (Western China), Fang Shanzheng (Central China). The Chairman reported on the progress of the regional tournament. This tournament began in Eastern China in 1926, and this is the seventh tournament. A summary of the results of the previous six tournaments shows that Eastern China won four times and Southern China won twice. At the meeting of representatives of various regions held in Shanghai in 1926, it was decided to accept the invitation of the Central China representatives to hold the next tournament in Central China. The 21st year was obstructed by the war and could not be held. This term was honored by the Hubei Education Department of Central China to prepare, and has reached the current stage of the competition. I am very grateful, but the inability of China and Hong Kong to participate together due to the situation or time constraints is a regret. Resolution: ㈠ This investigation</p>
<p>The competition has a long history of eight years. However, the number of participating units each year is only half of the total. The reason is mostly due to insufficient funds in various regions. Therefore, the Western China representative proposed the following remedial measures to encourage various regions to participate enthusiastically and meet the name and reality of the National Regional Division. Starting from the next session (23rd year of the Republic of China), the area for preparing for the competition (main area) is responsible for raising the travel expenses for participating in the competition in various areas, and the amount will be determined by the National Sports Association according to the amount of travel expenses between the various regions.</p>
<h3>Next Session Proposed to Be Held in Western China</h3>
<p>Sichuan Has Raised Travel Expenses for Various Regions</p>
<p>Sincere Welcome to All Areas to Send Teams to Shu Competition</p>
<p>National Sports Association Seeks Opinions from All Areas</p>
<p>Respected Sirs, The 8th National Divisional Football Championship is scheduled to be held in early April of the 23rd year of the Republic of China. The competition site (the area for preparing for the competition) was formally invited to be held in Sichuan by the Western China representative at the meeting of representatives of various areas in this competition. At that time, due to inconvenient transportation and financial concerns, it was not officially voted on. It is now known that the Western China District has been actively preparing and has raised the funds for stipulating travel expenses for each district. It sincerely welcomes the teams from each district to go to Shu to participate in the leadership of promoting mass sports in Western China. The good intentions are very effective and deeply fulfill the main purpose of the competition. The special letter is sent to seek the opinions of various regions. If the majority approves this move, it can be realized and comfort the expectations of the Western China Region. I hope that your region will give it detailed consideration and give a formal reply immediately. The National Sports Association of China will start on July 22nd.</p>
<h3>Main Zone Subsidizes Travel Expenses for Guest Zone</h3>
<p>Participants in Each Competition Only Reach Half</p>
<p>The Main Reason Is That It Is Obstructed by a Shortage of Funds</p>
<p>| The Sports Association Decided to Subsidize the Number and Notify All Zones |</p>
<p>Respected Sirs, The National Regional Football Championship was founded in 1926, and it is scheduled to be held once a year. Up to now, it has been held seven times. However, due to national affairs or due to a shortage of funds, the number of participating units is only half, which is a major regret in the history of the competition. This year's competition, when held in Wuchang, the representatives of various regions, after careful discussion by the representatives, decided on a method (detailed in the record of the representatives' meeting, Resolution ㈠) in order to remedy the name of the national region. After investigation by the Association, the Association surveyed the round-trip boat and vehicle fares between various regions, considered the burden of each region, and in accordance with the restrictions of the National Amateur Sports Rules, the Board of Directors of the Association approved and stipulated the list of the number of travel expenses that the competition organizing area (that is, the main area) should subsidize to the participating areas. The table will be opened and implemented starting from the next year (the 23rd year of the Republic of China). I hope that you will check it out. The National Sports Association of China will start.</p>

<h3>The 50,000 Yuan Funds for the National Games. The Preparatory Committee Will Request Additional Allocation</h3>
<p>The funds for this year's Double Tenth National Games have been approved by the Central Political Conference, so the Ministry of Education decided to hold it as scheduled, as reported in previous newspapers. According to the preparatory committee yesterday, the budget for the National Games was more than 110,000 yuan, but the Ministry of Education reduced it to more than 90,000 yuan, which is the minimum that can be reduced. The conference budget approved by the Central Political Conference the day before yesterday was only 50,000 yuan, which is too small and cannot be allocated by the preparatory committee. It is now planned to submit a request to the Central Government to increase the budget to avoid temporary difficulties. As for the organizational regulations of the conference, only the reception group has been slightly revised, and it will be announced by the Ministry soon.</p>

<h3>Talking About Loudspeakers</h3>
<p>— Yi Zhi</p>
<p>To make a radio emit a loud and clear sound, the design, selection, and configuration of all parts inside the radio must be appropriate. The loudspeaker is also an important part of it. If a radio is carefully configured in all parts but neglects the selection of the loudspeaker and uses an inappropriate one, it will be difficult to achieve satisfactory reception. Some loudspeakers require strong electrical power to operate, while others require only small electrical power. Due to their different structures, each has its own characteristics, advantages, and uses. Now let's briefly introduce them for reference. Loudspeakers can be divided into three types: (1) Fixed coil type or Magnetic type; (2) Moving coil type or Dynamic type; (3) Electrostatic type or Condenser type. Now, the simple principles,</p>
<p>structures, characteristics, advantages, and uses of the three types will be described separately. (1) Fixed Coil Type</p>
<p>The principle of a loudspeaker producing sound is to use the strength of the audio current to change the magnetic force of the magnet, causing the diaphragm to vibrate in the air, creating sound waves. Its simple structure principle is shown in Figure 1; M is a permanent magnet (or mother magnet), and M' is a small magnet (its magnetic force is entirely supplied by the mother magnet).</p>
<p>C is the audio current coil, and A is the diaphragm. When an external audio current passes through the audio coil, the magnet creates a change in suction, causing the diaphragm A to vibrate back and forth, creating sound waves. According to their structure, this type of loudspeaker can also be divided</p>
<p>into three types: (1) Double-pole loudspeaker (2) Balanced-armature loudspeaker (3) Balanced-diaphragm loudspeaker</p>
<p>(1) Double-pole Loudspeaker</p>
<p>This type of loudspeaker is the simplest of the magnetic types. Earpieces, as well as certain types of horn loudspeakers, are manufactured based on this principle. Its structure is shown in Figure 1. Its advantages are: (1) Simple structure, low price (2) Sensitive reception (3) Very low power consumption. Its disadvantages are: (1) The air gap between the diaphragm and the magnet is very small. If a slightly larger current is loaded, the diaphragm will be attracted and generate noise. If the distance between the diaphragm and the magnet is increased, it will not react to weak sounds. (2) Unequal reciprocating amplitude, prone to generating harmonic distortion. As for its uses: because it requires very little power, it is very suitable for small-power vacuum tube radios. Before the invention of high-power vacuum tubes, this type of loudspeaker once dominated the market. Now, while earpieces are still popular, horn loudspeakers are increasingly being phased out.</p>
<p>(2) Balanced-armature Loudspeaker Balanced-armature loudspeakers are designed to eliminate the shortcomings of the double-pole type. As shown in Figures 2 and 3: M is the mother magnet, E, F, G, H are small magnets, A is the balanced armature, C is the audio current coil, and D is the diaphragm. When an external audio current flows in from S and flows out from Y, the magnetic force of the G and F magnetic fields is strengthened, and the magnetic force of the G and H magnetic fields is reduced, causing the balanced armature to be attracted in a clockwise direction. However, the instantaneous audio current undergoes a change in polarity, flowing in from Y and flowing out from X, then the strength of the E and H magnetic fields increases, and the strength of the G and F magnetic fields decreases, and the balanced armature is attracted in a counterclockwise direction. This back-and-forth vibration, occurring thousands of times per second, creates sound waves in the air. This type of loudspeaker can eliminate the shortcomings of the double-pole type, so it is superior to the double-pole type. Its features: (1) The balanced armature always maintains its balanced position, so the reciprocating amplitude is always equal; (2) The magnetic field is not easily saturated, and the load current can often be slightly larger (3) Harmonic distortion will not occur. Its uses: It is suitable for vacuum tube radios with three or more tubes and can emit clear, loud, and pleasing sound, unlike the blurred and unpleasant sound of the double-pole type.

<h3>Several Points to Note Regarding the Installation of Radio Sets</h3>
<p>— Zhu Tianfu</p>
<p>Installing a radio is something that anyone can do by following the circuit diagram and configuring the components. And everyone knows that the parts for a radio should be of good quality. However, if attention is not paid to the internal arrangement and wiring, it will have a negative impact on the selectivity, sensitivity,</p>
<p>and volume (loudness and clarity) of the radio.</p>
<p>Regarding the arrangement:</p>
<p>The tuning condenser should not be close to any coils and should not be placed on a straight line, otherwise the tuning will not be sharp and the selectivity will be reduced. The coils of the high-frequency part must not be placed on a straight line or in parallel with the transformer or choke coil of the low-frequency part. They should be placed at right angles to each other. (According to the results of my experiments, an angle of eighty-four or five degrees is optimal.) Otherwise, the received sound will be very noisy.</p>
<p>The position of the regeneration coil should not be close to the antenna coil, and it is best to be close to the filament side, which has the effect of reducing noise.</p>
<p>If it is an AC radio, the installation of the rectifier part should be isolated from the radio part, otherwise AC hum will inevitably occur.3</p>
<p>The high-frequency amplifying vacuum tube should be isolated with a metal shield, because the magnetic force generated in the surrounding coils can pass through the vacuum tube and be converted into noise by induction.</p>
<p>Regarding wiring:</p>
<p>The wiring of each part should be straight and as short as possible. Special attention should be paid to short waves. The wiring points must be soldered firmly with tin, otherwise the joints will accumulate dust, resulting in poor electrical conductivity or leakage.</p>
<p>The flux used must not contain acidic substances, otherwise the soldered joints will corrode over time.</p>
<p>The wiring of the AC filament should not have different lengths and should be twisted to reduce noise and AC hum.</p>
<p>The two wires (high-frequency wiring and low-frequency wiring) should not be parallel. If this cannot be avoided, the distance should be slightly farther (at least two centimeters).</p>
<p>It is best to use colored wires to distinguish the wiring, such as red for the plate circuit and blue for the grid circuit, for easy inspection and repair.</p>
<h3>How to Find the Appropriate Voltage on a Voltage Divider</h3>
<p>— Ming Xiang</p>
<p>In a radio, the vacuum tubes used are not all of the same type; even if the same vacuum tubes are used, the tasks they perform often differ. Therefore, the voltages required for the plate or screen grid of each vacuum tube are inconsistent, each having its appropriate value. In a DC radio, these different potentials can be obtained from the B battery, which is very easy, and the voltage at each point will not change regardless of the working conditions of the radio. However, in an AC radio, the voltage for the plate and screen grid is supplied by the DC voltage output from the rectifier tube, and its value depends on the different voltage drops at various points on the voltage divider. Because the voltage drop is related to the current flowing through it, the voltage values at various points on the voltage divider cannot be fixed and must depend on the magnitude of the current drawn by the vacuum tubes in the radio. As shown in the figure, it is a simple rectifier part of a radio. The voltage between points A and B is the highest, set at 300 volts. If a 15,000-ohm resistor R is connected between points A and B to serve as a voltage divider, to find a point with a certain appropriate voltage value, it is necessary to first know how much current flows from that point (this value is the plate current or screen grid current of the vacuum tube), and then add it to the original current of the divider R. Divide the voltage drop by this sum to obtain the resistance value between that point and point A. For example, on the voltage divider shown in the figure, to find point C at 180 volts, the current flowing from that point is 20 milliamperes; the original current of the divider R, according to Ohm's law, should be 300 ÷ 150</p>
<p>00 = 0.02 amperes. The current between A and C is the sum of these two currents, 40 milliamperes. The potential drop between A and C is 300 - 180 = 120 volts, so the resistance between A and C should be 120 ÷ 0.04 = 3000 ohms.</p>
<p>The voltage at point C obtained by this method is not very accurate, because after current is drawn from point C, the current between C and B cannot remain at 20 milliamperes. Therefore, the voltage at point C is higher than 180 volts, so</p>
<p>point C should be moved slightly downwards, increasing the resistance between A and C to obtain the most accurate voltage.</p>
<h3>Trivia</h3>
<p>— Qi Yao</p>
<p>The negative charge of an electron is approximately one sextillionth of a coulomb, its smallness is astonishing.</p>
<p>One thousand feet of number one soft copper wire has approximately one ohm of resistance.</p>
<p>The resistance of the human body depends on whether the skin is dry or moist. Under normal circumstances, it is around three thousand ohms. If one-tenth of an ampere of current passes through the human body, there is a risk of death.</p>
<p>The copper wire used in various components inside the most sophisticated and complex radio receivers, if straightened, would probably be longer than all the railroad mileage in China.</p>
<p>Someone once used very fine copper wire and other parts to make a crystal radio that was less than one cubic inch in size and was able to receive broadcasts very clearly.</p>
<p>Small Experience</p>
<h3>Saving a Transformer</h3>
<p>— Zhang Guoquan</p>
<p>If you want to move a radio that uses 110 volts in the French Concession of Shanghai to the Chinese or British Concession, where the voltage is 220 volts, then you have to spend money to buy a 110/220 volt transformer. But now there is a very economical method, which is to use a 110 volt, approximately</p>
<p>40 watt light bulb (depending on the wattage of the radio) connected to one end of the power cord, and it can be used. (As shown in the figure) However, if you want to convert a 220 volt radio to 110 volts, you cannot use this method and must buy a transformer to use it.</p>
<h3>Simplified Method for Changing to Different Voltages Liang Shaoyu</h3>
<p>The primary wires of power transformers sold in the market (power square) often have three wires, for users to switch between different voltages. Because the Chinese area and public concession of Shanghai are all 220 pounds, only the French concession is 110 pounds. If someone wants to move the machine from the French Concession to the Chinese and Public Concessions or move it back to the old place, it is necessary to change the primary wiring, this kind of procedure is very troublesome, and the time is not economical, and it is even worse if there are no welding tools at home. Now there is a very simple method, just buy a single-pole double-throw switch (commonly known as a stone knife switch) from a radio materials store, connect it according to the diagram below, then when you move, you can safely throw the switch to the appropriate voltage, which is extremely convenient, and you may as well try it.</p>

<p>— An Mo</p>
<p>According to Philips, in the past year, seventeen countries broadcast a total of 2090 times in Esperanto. and broadcast by ninety radio stations. His programs are not only language courses, but also many lectures on science, engineering, and art topics.</p>
<h3>Domestic and Foreign News</h3>
<p>— Qian Junmu</p>
<p>The broadcasting station attached to Tianyi Film Company has stopped broadcasting for a long time due to equipment modification. Yesterday morning, the reporter heard the station test broadcasting around 4 or 5 o'clock. The results were more beautiful than before, and the microphone and cartridge were clear. It is expected that it will be officially broadcast soon.</p>
<p>The Xinyi National Music Society has been established for several years. The club is located in Xitangjia Lane, Nanshi. In order to enhance public entertainment, the club will broadcast national music and harmonica from 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM today at the Tongle Radio Station. It is said that the program is very exciting, and there will definitely be a grand occasion at that time. Introduction</p>

<h3>On Heads</h3>
<p>— Shijiu</p>
<p>Speaking of heads, it is the most touched thing. On the human body, whether it is the mouth or the hand or a certain part, in order to vent something, etc., if a great disaster is brought down, the head always suffers unjust grievances. Such things are common in newspapers, and I think everyone can understand. The so-called unjust grievance, to put it elegantly, is called "sentenced to capital punishment"; in vulgar terms, it is "beheading"! The head is a tool for eating. If the head is killed, naturally there will be no food to eat. Imagine how pitiful it is. The ancients' determination of the punishment of beheading was truly ingenious. When Jin Shengtan was about to be executed, he said; "Beheading is the most painful thing, I never thought that I would obtain it unintentionally." This sentence is still regarded as a heroic saying by some people; however, they have been deceived by Shengtan. Why? Who does not cherish their own head? Shengtan cannot be an exception. "Beheading is the most painful thing," in other words, is "From now on, there will be no food to eat, which is very pitiful." Moreover, who obtains beheading intentionally? Therefore, Shengtan's words always feel somewhat contradictory. Also, words such as "Whose head is good for cutting" are all just deceiving people. If you believe it, you will be driven away again.</p>
<p>There is a crooked poem on beheading, which seems to have some truth; I am now recording it below, please take a look at it:</p>
<p>Hearing that the head can be killed, everyone is afraid of being beheaded? Every head can be killed, without killing, there is no head. Killing is up to him to kill, the head is difficult to be my head. Unless you are the one who kills heads, who would want to kill their own head?</p>
<p>The value of the head, comparing the present with the past, is vastly different. In the past, there were people who offered their heads as a gift. Jing Ke assassinated the King of Qin, and it would not have worked without Fan Yuqi's head. This is strong evidence. Now, the heavens are opening up a killing field. Foreign troubles cannot be cleared, and bandits cannot be eliminated. The value of the head is even less than that of a watermelon. If you have money, you can go abroad for a walk, let this eating tool eat some big dishes and taste exotic flavors, which can be considered worthwhile in this life. Otherwise, even if you have no food to eat, if you are not careful, perhaps even this tool will be moved to a different place, which is also unknown.</p>
<p>Peddling some foreign sophistry, wanting to sell wild people's heads orally, or wanting to stand out in writing, this is originally a means of eating. However, who can guarantee that there will be no crisis of "unintentionally obtaining it"?</p>
<h3>Nocturne of Solitude</h3>
<p>— Huo Xueming</p>
<p>My body is immersed in 36,000 qing of Taihu Lake, and the moonlight, like flowing water, pours in from the window lattice, spreading on the flower tiles, just like the slightly rippling waves of the lake. Carrying a light chill, the wind blows laboriously, and the moonlight seems to have subtle wrinkles. I, immersed in such a world made of white glass, feel cold and quiet. Like this oil-like moonlight, it pours into my heart, illuminating the congealed blood on my heart, so red!</p>
<p>The reflection of a corner of the building, soundly sleeping in the moonlight outside the window, is like a demon with black wings, overlooking my door, just like the peaks on the edge of Taihu Lake, intimidating the lonely geese in the cool sky, and the clouds are scattered in shock; but I am like a lost wild goose!</p>
<p>A faint mood, like a glass of white water, with no fragrance, no taste, no color, and no heat; lying quietly, it is a drying up dead water, only expecting to dry up sooner!</p>
<p>I can no longer think of the fleeting youth, sitting in the armchair, which is my grave. If the moonlight turns into a tombstone, please write the shadow of the cool-sky geese on it! This lonely goose, it will tell you that it is just the word "person" that is midnight, and there is no sound at all, only the wandering blocks of death are floating in front of me. It is not the shadow of a tree, not the shadow of a mountain, not the shadow of anything else, it is too vague, even a</p>
<p>The word "person" has flown away, flown without a trace.</p>
<p>However, I seem to hear the sound of a piano coming from the neighbor's house, so clear, so lingering, so melancholy, as if saying;</p>
<p>"Once upon a time there was a woman who gave me a pure white silk scarf,</p>
<p>As soon as the corpse is thrown in, it disappears immediately, in this way, it is considered ascending to heaven.</p>
<p>Gold burial is used for the poor. Its procedure is that after a person dies, lamas are also invited to chant scriptures, and after chanting the scriptures, the body is carried into the wilderness to</p>
<p>A large pile of leaves is burned to attract birds, and then the undertaker uses a sharp knife to cut the body, including the skin and bones, into countless small pieces (about the size of beans). Then mix it with Qingke flour, and then feed it all to the birds. The speed at which the corpse is eaten by the birds determines the good and evil of the deceased in life. It is best to finish eating on the same day. If it takes several days to finish eating, it is believed that this is a sign that the deceased was not a good person in life and suffered a lot after death. So the family must use a lama to transcend him again.</p>
<p>The birds over there are used to eating dead people's meat, so when they see the smoke from the evergreen leaves burned by the funeral people, they know that where the thick smoke rises, there is food to eat again, so the birds from all over rush to gather. After they come, if the corpse is not yet delicious, then they all surround the corpse and stop on the ground waiting until the undertaker cuts the minced corpse meat and scatters it on the ground, they peck at it with joy. As for the species of birds, there are various kinds, but crows and eagles are the most. The crows and eagles there are taller than anywhere else in China, and they are also bolder, often approaching human bodies. Sometimes people touch them with their hands, and they are not surprised to escape. This is because people never harm them.</p>
<p>The name of gold burial is due to the fact that the corpse must be cut with a knife, and the knife is made of metal, hence the name. It is also known as bird burial because the corpse is used to feed the birds. (According to Mongolia, bird burial is performed. But Mongolia's bird burial is that after a person dies, they are hung on a tree to be pecked at by birds. Ascending to heaven when the meat is gone.) In Tibet, each city and village has one or two designated places for water burial and gold burial.</p>
<h3>The Future</h3>
<p>— Ye Yigu</p>
<p>In the future, many contributors' children will be wax bags with empty hearts; the reason for this is that the children's fathers used to squeeze out the wax juice!</p>
<p>In the future, many schools will adopt phonographs and radios to teach students' lessons. Teachers will naturally not be invited, and those who manage classroom order may be Qiu Ba (soldiers). In this way, I am happy for China, because from now on education will be popularized!</p>
<p>In the future, it may be even more difficult to be a person than it is now; not to write articles falsely, to seal the lips; the freedom to breathe air will also be restricted.</p>
<p>In the future, the internal organization of universities will also undergo great reforms; the steps of the reform are like this: the library will be changed into a cafe, the sports field will be changed into a dance floor, the museum will be changed into a movie theater, and the research institute will be changed into a massage parlor.</p>
<p>In the future, women may return to the primitive era; because their clothes will change from long sleeves to short sleeves, from short sleeves to sleeveless, to vests, to bare chests, to nudity.</p>
<p>In the future, school toilets will have special sexology lectures.</p>
<p>In the future, China may be in Sichuan. Because Sichuan has a dangerous terrain, people cannot attack, and you can fight each other.</p>
<h3>Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Eleven. Bowing to Promise Marriage with Deep Affection. Caring for Soldiers with Joy and Cheer</p>
<p>This evening, besides listening to the opera, most of the time was spent discussing Brigade Commander Ma. When the play ended, they walked out of the door of the theater, and it happened that Brigade Commander Ma also took his new wife out from inside, and they met unexpectedly at the door. Mrs. Ma said to Huang Manying; Miss Huang, why didn't you come to sit in the box just now? I have a lot to say to you. Huang Manying said; I was with guests just now, it was inconvenient to go to your box. Can I go to your mansion to see you some other day? Brigade Commander Ma replied on behalf of his wife, smiling and nodding; Of course, of course. You are very welcome. Huang Manying was about to say something else, but a rush of people coming out of the theater separated everyone. Back at the Huang family, Manying sent his mother and daughter back to their rooms to rest. Guizhi smiled again and said; That Brigade Commander Ma just now was very friendly, and he even asked Miss Huang to go to his house for a seat. Huang Manying said; What does a brigade commander count for? It's just that people always look at their own opportunities. Tian's classmate is now a division commander, army commander, and commander-in-chief. Guizhi couldn't help but be a little puzzled when he heard this. He has those broad classmates, how come he is still a company commander? Manying and Jiang sat on chairs against the wall, and Guizhi was sitting against the bed rail, facing Manying. He didn't look at Manying, but turned his face to Jiang and said? Aren't Company Commander Tian and the others classmates? This "them," Guizhi secretly included Zhao Ziqiang as well. Manying laughed and said; It's not like that. Company Commander Zhao is said to have come from the training corps. Company Commander Tian was originally a student who was admitted to the military academy, and then was assigned to the army to be a soldier. Jiang couldn't help but exclaimed, "Oh!" So Company Commander Tian was promoted from being a soldier. Manying said; Isn't that right? Now, to be an officer, you always have to rise step by step from being a soldier. Being a soldier can make you a platoon leader and company commander, and being a company commander or battalion commander can make you a regimental commander or brigade commander. Thinking of jumping up in one step is not possible. (One two three)</p>
<p>On the silk scarf, I also wrote my own name. But he left me far away, using this handkerchief to wipe my tears!</p>
<p>·····················"</p>
<p>This piano sound shattered my calmness, my heart, and my bright moon, word by word.</p>
<p>The whole room is surrounded by black silk, binding me tightly, so tightly that I cannot breathe!</p>
<h3>Tibetan Funeral Methods</h3>
<p>— Xiao Chang</p>
<p>My friend Jian Fusheng, a native of Hunan, served as an officer in Tibet for many years during the late Qing Dynasty. After the recovery, he returned home and now resides in my hometown. He often tells me about strange and unusual events in Tibet. Now I will transcribe one or two as follows:</p>
<p>Tibetan funerals are divided into two types: water burial and gold burial. All superiors and lamas are water buried when they die. The procedure for water burial is that as soon as a person dies, eight or twelve lamas are immediately invited to chant scriptures. After about two hours of chanting, the body is carried to the water's edge on a wooden board for burial. Once at the destination, all the clothes on the deceased's body are stripped off, and a piece of pig iron about two feet long, four inches wide, and two inches thick is tied to the back. Then the body is thrown into the water. The current is very turbulent in the river or stream where the body is thrown, but they are all in the wild. As for the undertaker, it is a profession, just like our woodcutters here. Whenever someone dies, you have to ask them, and each has its own territory. If A goes to B's territory to do business, then B will negotiate with A, which is like when one person violates the rules in our industry and the entire industry discusses it with him.</p>

<h3>[Private Estimate of US Cotton P]</h3>
<p>Sixth, New York Electric Dispatch: The Burnquist Agency estimates this year's cotton fields at 40,645,000 acres, with a production status of 74.1% of normal, yielding 13,760,000 bales.</p>
<p>Rice Prices in Hexia Fluctuated and Increased Slightly</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, over thirty boats arrived. The market initially showed fluctuations, but later, due to a telegram from a customer syndicate reporting that the stock there was gradually clearing, the market slightly improved. Consequently, customer syndicates in Shanghai, such as those from Weihaiwei, procured around two thousand bags. Local shops followed suit, and sellers also raised prices, immediately invigorating the market. Statistics show that, except for the usual syndicates and "Du Yang Jian" rice, which remained stable, the prices of other types of rice, such as Su Tong, Nan Gang Hou Geng, Qing Jiao, and Song Si, increased by about a jiao. "Yin Bian Yuan" rice remained popular.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, only over ten boats arrived from various routes in Hexia, and the number of boats remaining in Hexia was scarce. "Bai Geng" rice continued to be sold, causing the market price to rise by about two jiao. Early "Bo" rice arrived in small quantities and sold quickly, with the price increasing by about a chi. "Yang Du Jian" rice also closely approached a chi, "Ke Jian" rice increased by six or seven ren, "Bian Yuan" rice increased by two jiao, and "Yang Ke Xian" rice increased gradually by three to five fen.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for "Yang Ke Xian" rice was good because merchants from Fujian and Zhejiang continued to procure it, raising hopes. Sellers also intended to raise prices, but buyers were not very eager to purchase. Therefore, the market only improved by three fen. If larger syndicates increase their purchases, the market could rise further. However, the current procurement in Zhejiang and Fujian is quite active, so prices can remain stable for now. The Fujian syndicate procured over a thousand bags of Hunan machine-milled rough red rice. The Zhejiang syndicate procured two hundred bags of small-grind rice and one thousand bags each of Beijing and Xixi rice, as well as five hundred bags each of Hunan and Jiangxi rice. Only the machine-milled late-season oil and Jing rice are from the central region; the rest are high-quality goods from the major market.</p>
<p>Wheat Flour Futures Dropped in the Morning and Rose in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, prices of all months showed a downward trend. Although the price of foreign wheat recovered by two or three jiao, most people were pessimistic because the price of new wheat was already low, and the inventories of various factories were not thin. Furthermore, the transactions of customer syndicates were only intermittent and did not involve large-scale trading. Therefore, the market prices for each month were lower than the previous day by one fen or five li. However, after the afternoon opening, sentiment was initially unstable, with the current month falling to 2.2725 yuan. After the second session, however, it gradually recovered because northern syndicates started trading in spot flour, amounting to tens of thousands of bags in two days, tightening the market for the current month. Distant months also followed and improved, but trading was not smooth, and factories remained hesitant to sell, so this situation could not stabilize. As a result, the current month was up by 0.25 li, August was up by 7.5 li, September to November were up by five li, and December was up by 7.5 li.</p>
<p>Both Futures and Spot Wheat Markets Were Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market was stable in the morning. The price of foreign wheat recovered by two or three jiao, and the opening prices for each month were stable. However, actual buyers were not enthusiastic, so although the market was stable, trading was difficult. After the afternoon opening, the market deteriorated again because the supply of spot wheat from various routes continued to flood in, and factories only made slight purchases. This factual pressure made it difficult for the standard market to improve. Therefore, the near-term months declined again. As a result, the current month was down by three fen, August was down by two fen, September was up by one fen, October was down by one fen, and December was up by three fen. The spot wheat market remained weak despite abundant supply, and the market became softer, with lower-quality goods dropping by another three to five fen compared to the previous day. Because factories had large inventories, they were unwilling to compete for purchases. Huai'an wheat was at 3.60 yuan, Gaoyou wheat was at 3.60 yuan, Kunshan wheat was at 3.58 to 3.64 yuan, Shuangfeng wheat was at 3.52 to 3.53 yuan, and Zhitang wheat was at 3.45 to 3.38 yuan, totaling over 7,000 bags.</p>
<p>Rapeseed Crop Failure Tightens the Market</p>
<p>Since the hoarding households sold a hundred tons of rapeseed at a price of 5.25 yuan for Wuhu goods, there seemed to be hope for a price increase. This was because the supply in the producing areas was scarce, and the procurement price was firm, making it difficult for merchants to purchase. Therefore, the trading center may shift to the Shanghai market. Hoarders unanimously expect prices to rise. Currently, foreign merchants are offering around 7.60 to 7.70 yuan, but sellers are still unwilling to sell.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea: Sichuan New Silk Begins Shipping to Shanghai (High Price for Chang'an Summer Cocoons)</p>
<p>New summer cocoons from Changfa have been on the market for several days. Although the supply is abundant, farmers are unwilling to sell the high-quality foreign cocoons at lower prices, leading to a sharp rise in cocoon prices, with the highest price reaching 42 yuan and the average price around 36 yuan.</p>
<p>(Limited Silkworm Rearing in Yixing in Summer)</p>
<p>In previous years, Yixing summer silkworms were freshly hatched. This year, although mulberry leaves are still lush, silkworm farmers are generally preparing to rear autumn silkworms. Therefore, there are not many summer silkworm hatchings. The early batches have already finished their major molt and are starting to eat leaves, and they will soon be ready to spin their cocoons. The silkworm condition is very good, but the number of silkworm eggs is limited.</p>
<p>(First Batch of New Yellow Silk from Sichuan Arrives)</p>
<p>This year's spring cocoons in Sichuan Province have also had a bumper harvest. New silk has begun shipping to Shanghai. Yesterday, the Minsheng ship brought the first batch of eighty-four boxes of new yellow silk from Mianyang and other places. The new goods from the Sichuan factory may arrive in Shanghai within a few days.</p>
<p>(Dull Sales of Rayon)</p>
<p>Recently, the exchange rate has been fluctuating, and merchants and domestic buyers of rayon are watching and waiting. Yesterday, only local merchants and manufacturers restocked eighteen boxes of Feixiang, Wuxing, and Kongque brand spot goods, priced from 181.50 yuan to 168.75 yuan net.</p>
<p>(Sluggish Silk Sales in Shanghai)</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot silk price in New York was 2.21 yuan, up one cent per pound. The price of Japanese silk in Yokohama continued to fall by 15 yen to 975 yen. Although European and American firms in Shanghai are trying to support the market, Chinese merchants are insisting on high prices, leading to thin trading. Only seventy bales of Sichuan yellow factory silk and forty bales of Shanghai white factory silk were traded, with prices remaining firm.</p>
<p>European Sales of Luzhuang Green Tea Continue to Be Strong</p>
<p>Yesterday, the European sales of Luzhuang green tea from Tunxi, Wuyuan, and Sui'an continued to be strong. There were continuous telegrams from France requesting high-quality Zhenmei, Zhenmei, Xiami, and Cangzhu teas. In addition, the exchange rate was favorable and tea prices were low, so Jinlong, Xiehe, and Yihua and other major foreign firms were unusually interested. Yesterday, over four thousand four hundred boxes of red and green tea from various routes were traded. The market prices for high-quality Zhenmei Zhucha teas increased by three or four yuan, and other teas were also firm.</p>
<p>Tin Prices Remain Solid</p>
<p>The tin market has been good recently, and the market prices remain very solid. Yesterday, small amounts were still priced at 185 yuan per dan, Dutch tin at 210 yuan, and foreign bars at 200 yuan. Newly arrived Hengdi tin from Hankou can also be priced up to 192 or 193 yuan. However, the current spot goods are very scarce, and the demand from various syndicates is strong, so supply cannot meet demand, making the market increasingly firm. It is rumored that some firms in the industry are planning to hoard goods, so the outlook for prices is quite positive.</p>

<p>FREE TALK</p>
<p>Turgenev's Last Moments by Yu Dafu | Written for the 50th Anniversary of Turgenev's Death |</p>
<p>Ivan Turgenev, born at noon on October 28, 1818, playfully predicted his death by misarranging numbers, believing it would occur on October 1, 1881. However, as the end of 1881 approached, his health remained unaffected. During that year, he even collaborated with his lover, Madame Viardot, to translate his own work, "The Song of Triumphant Love," into French and wrote "The Daredevil."</p>
<p>In the spring of 1882, despite facing numerous misfortunes such as his daughter's return and the onset of manic episodes, his health remained normal. However, in late February, a sudden illness struck. From the time he took to his bed in March of that year until his passing on the afternoon of September 3 of the following year, he endured immense physical suffering.</p>
<p>Amidst his suffering, he repeatedly requested suicide to alleviate his pain, even begging Maupassant, who was treating him, for a pistol and asking Madame Viardot to throw his body out the window.</p>
<p>Leo Tolstoy, upon hearing of his illness, sent a sincere letter of condolence. Turgenev personally penned a reply in pencil from his sickbed, which became his final correspondence. He was aware of his impending death, feeling finished and exhausted, and urged Tolstoy to dedicate himself to literary pursuits.</p>
<p>In January 1883, during an attempt to operate on a cyst, he refused local anesthesia, wanting to personally experience the intense pain of the surgery. Afterwards, he told Daudet, who came to visit him, "I tasted the pain myself and discovered an appropriate way to express these feelings and states of mind. The scalpel cutting into the flesh felt a bit like a sharp knife slicing a banana."</p>
<p>One evening, half a month before his death, he summoned Madame Viardot to his bedside and implored her to transcribe a short story he was dictating, about a descendant of Russian aristocrats who had fallen into a life of horse theft. This story, titled "The End," became his last work, symbolizing the decline and fall of the Russian aristocracy.</p>
<p>On Friday, the last day of August 1883, Louisa entered his room. In his semi-consciousness, he seemed to recognize her, exclaiming...</p>
<p>"Louisa! It's so strange, why are my legs hanging in that corner? And the room is filled with coffins. But, they still allow me three days to live." On Sunday, September 2, he regained consciousness briefly and spoke words that only Madame Pauline Viardot could understand. On Monday, September 3, at two o'clock in the afternoon, he passed away.</p>

<p>From "Literati" to "Mad Dog" by Tian Lei</p>
<p>Reading the article "On the Immorality of Literati" published in this journal the other day filled me with endless feelings. I feel that the immorality of literati is not a personal issue but a serious problem in current education and culture. Because the various scandals mentioned in the article precisely demonstrate the bankruptcy of our country's education and the serious illness of our culture.</p>
<p>For example, Mr. Zeng can create "the liberation of prefaces," use other people's banners to promote himself, and delete and modify other people's letters to make them look like "a collection of praises." We cannot help but admit that he has some "intelligence" and "genius" for such "ingenious ideas." Unfortunately, no one knows or uses his intelligence and genius, so his genius and intelligence can only be used for "the liberation of prefaces," "a collection of praises," and "playing mahjong." Therefore, while it is the fault of society that talent is buried, society cannot shirk its responsibility for the misuse of talent.</p>
<p>Similarly, Mr. Zhang ×× originally studied geology in Japan. However, after returning to China with his geology studies, he could not find a use for it and had to imitate Kikuchi Kan of Japan, specializing in the creation of triangular love novels. One after another... Using a fixed model, he keeps making them like that, unchanged for years. And the quality of his writing is getting worse and worse, crudely made for the sole purpose of making money. Some people even say that he is a "triangular love novel merchant." As a person who studied geology, he can only engage in describing sexual love to cater to the low-level tastes of the general undecided youth and cheat the money in the pockets of young people. This is indeed due to the author's own lack of progress on the one hand, but the chaotic society cannot but bear some responsibility on the other hand.</p>
<p>Even his ability to spread rumors and launch cold arrows, although despicable and hateful, ultimately shows his "intelligence," as the saying goes, "he is a small talent." A talented person who cannot be used by society, of course, he only has freedom to exert himself. Like a fierce dog, we cannot use it to search for birds and beasts, nor can we use it to guard the gate. Of course. He can only bite people and objects, because the instinct to bite cannot but be exerted.</p>
<p>However, he has been haranguing on various tabloids recently, and the other day he published an announcement in a newspaper, insinuating and wantonly slandering people. What he did, I think, seems to have gone beyond "instinct." This is simply a kind of mad behavior, a kind of completely irrational behavior. If we take the dog as an example, he is just like a "mad dog." │However, he did receive higher education in Japan after all, and the title of "mad dog" seems to be insulting to "culture." Then, let's say he is a "madman"!</p>
<p>For a "madman," we can only feel pity. Really, who can talk about "morality" and "immorality" with a madman? Playing the lute to a cow, he can't understand! He can't understand!</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Yesterday, I saw Mr. Zhang's announcement, and in a fit of anger, I immediately wrote an announcement in reply. When I woke up this morning, I opened the newspaper and saw my announcement, and I deeply regretted being meddlesome and shouldn't have talked back to this kind of person. If Mr. Zhang continues to spread rumors and slander me, I am determined to ignore it and let him expose his own personality as much as possible. However, this journal will continue to severely attack the minority of scum in the literary world in the future, and do a little bit of work to eliminate filth in the new literary and art circles in China.</p>
<p>Vanity by Zhou Lengjia</p>
<p>Listlessly sitting in front of the dormitory window, looking at the dim sky outside the window, her heart was filled with endless annoyance.</p>
<p>This annoyance, pressing down on her heart, was not a matter of one or two days; since she entered this highest institution of learning, her heart had been completely occupied by annoyance.</p>
<p>People seem to have a natural love for beauty, so women with a little beauty have become the target of everyone, and there are groups of men chasing after them everywhere, hoping to achieve their goals of courtship. Moreover, these men are also good at guessing women's psychology and satisfying their desires. For example, in this school, there is a popular title of "Queen." Every woman who comes here to study, no matter how well-versed she is, as long as she has enough beauty, she will receive the title of "Queen." Receiving the respect of all the students in the school.</p>
<p>Wei unfortunately has beautiful features, so this title of "Queen" lightly fell on her.</p>
<p>This has become the main cause of Wei's troubles. Although she does not object to people calling her that, and her vanity makes her feel proud and happy because of this title. What she is annoyed about is how to make this title of "Queen" worthy of the name.</p>
<p>Wei's family is not very well-off. Her father is just a small businessman. In order to allow her to receive higher education, he has put in a lot of effort, and of course he is unable to provide her with food and clothing expenses. And for Wei, this is indispensable. How shameful it is for a queen who is respected by the whole school to not have some appropriate clothes to wear!</p>
<p>So, Wei's heart sank deeply into annoyance.</p>
<p>About a week ago, one day after class, Wei was taking a walk on campus. Suddenly, behind her, she faintly heard the laughter of men.</p>
<p>"Ping, look, this is our queen."</p>
<p>"Really? Why is she wearing such simple clothes?"</p>
<p>Wei instinctively lowered her head, her face burning red. She no longer had the mood to take a walk and hurried back to her dormitory. Feelings of shame and anger filled her consciousness, and her heart could not be at peace all afternoon. She felt that if she did not have some clothes to dress herself up, she would really be ashamed of the title of "Queen."</p>
<p>And what made Dong feel most jealous was that several female students in the dormitory had to bring a package of clothing materials to the room almost every few days. What kind of Walsaa, what kind of georgette, those dazzling colors often flashed before her eyes, and the giggling laughter that seemed to be deliberately showing off to her added a lot of shame to her.</p>
<p>At the same time, there was also something that made Wei panic; the school was going to hold a garden party soon, and the students were already preparing their clothes there, but she, who had the title of queen and whose appearance was superior to the whole school, was still wearing a calico cheongsam, and had no other clothing. In contrast, it already showed her simplicity, not to mention that the classmates would still elect her to undertake an important program!</p>
<p>In desperation, Wei had no choice but to write a letter to her home to request it. Really, besides this, she had no other way to go.</p>
<p>But now the reply came, and what the letter gave Wei was only disappointment. The father only recounted his difficulties in a rambling way. He didn't give her any satisfaction. Indeed, the situation of small merchants under this heavy exploitation is very difficult, and Wei couldn't bear to urge him anymore.</p>
<p>So, she could only let annoyance continue to devour her heart. She sat sullenly in front of the window, looking at the dim sky outside the window, and felt an unusual depression in her spirit.</p>
<p>Unintentionally, Wei pulled out a letter from the drawer. She knew at a glance from the rough and powerful handwriting that it was written to her by a male classmate. Wei also heard something about this person's background, knowing that he was the son of an overseas Chinese merchant and that his family was very wealthy. This made her heart flutter a little when she first received the letter. But she was unwilling to immediately condescend to him, so she had been putting his letter aside. Now that she unintentionally turned it out, it suddenly gave her an idea. She felt that to maintain her queen's honor and to make everyone admire her, she had to temporarily abandon some useless moral concepts and reply to his letter.</p>
<p>Wei picked up the pen without hesitation and wrote a reply to him, but the annoyance in her heart became more profound. Desire and reason were fighting, and sweat dripped from her forehead like rain, soaking the whole sheet of paper. The paper was full of ink stains everywhere, and she didn't even know what she was writing.</p>
<p>Creative Fiction: Ordinary Things (5) by Dan Guosun</p>
<p>On the west side of what used to be called "Xi Family Residence" but is now deliberately called "Kriglaro Road" by the imperialists as a demonstration, we can clearly see, from under the morning sun, many Western-style high-rise buildings of different styles and colors scattered among the trees inside the hundreds-footed low walls with iron railings on both sides of the road. There are no vehicles on the road, the short trees have shed all their leaves, and the high-rise buildings have their windows closed; everything is so quiet as if they are all in a deep sleep. Making us wonder if the gray curtain in the sky is specially set up for this entire large-scale modern mortuary. Occasionally seeing one or two burly men in greatcoats teasing a few cages of lark birds inside a wrought iron gate that is not fitted with iron plates, can also make us understand that everything that can be moved and cannot be moved on the fence or railings has self-serving and constant precautionary measures to leisurely spend their years in this calm place.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a series of alarms came from the south, followed by a series of rustling friction sounds squeezed from the nearby asphalt road into the air. A few peace-loving pedestrians on Kriglaro Road could not help but look up instinctively at the source of those sounds; an empty car came around the bend from the south end of the cross road to the east. It continued to sound the alarm for more than ten seconds, and turned into a wrought iron gate on the south side of the road that seemed to be opened in response to the alarm. This is the car that Berton sent to pick up Zhiguang that morning, who expected to come back empty-handed.</p>
<p>It turned out that after Berton sent Yongsun out the door yesterday, he carefully considered the assistance, and then used the phone to ask a few familiar colleagues, knowing that two or three of them also received the same notice.</p>
<p>"This is ultimately a minority!" Berton said, touching his head to the relatives and friends who were helping him consider, "Such a big topic, why do the workers only want a few of us to write articles? ... Why do the workers only want a few of us to write articles?"</p>
<p>"The two or three families mentioned just now," Berton's cousin Shi asked, "Are their scales similar to Changxing's?"</p>
<p>"Probably about the same, we are all considered among the top-class manufacturers."</p>
<p>"Then, how is it considered top-class? How much capital is required?"</p>
<p>"Capital? No one knows anyone, so the industry insiders definitely don't only differentiate based on capital, because what the industry insiders pay attention to is the business method."</p>
<p>"Methods? This is not something we laymen can understand!"</p>
<p>"That's not necessarily the case, to put it simply, for example, when transporting materials, our families not only use our own trucks, but sometimes we also rent out the trucks to other families. Such methods, such equipment, are not what second-class manufacturers can do."</p>
<p>"Then, where are Changxing's trucks now?"</p>
<p>"They are all parked in the truck dealership on Avenue Joffre."</p>
<p>Lao Shi was stunned for a while after hearing this sentence, and then said;</p>
<p>"I initially thought that their purpose was the trucks. Now that the trucks have such a proper place, even if they come to ask for them, I think at most you will have to spend more effort to persuade them; everything must be willing on both sides, how can you force them!"</p>
<p>Berton nodded with a bitter smile, but his wife, He Peiyu, raised her hand and said;</p>
<p>"The trucks do have a proper place, but all kinds of important materials are piled up in the factory in Dananmen..."</p>
<p>"Ah, all piled up in the factory in Dananmen! ..." Lao Shi read it again in the same way.</p>
<p>"You said 'how can you force them', Fifth Brother Shi," Peiyu said, "I think it would be better if the workers in the factory didn't come to force them. Since all the important materials are in that place!"</p>
<p>"Then," Lao Shi said with a trembling voice, "I think there is no need to call Zhiguang to go to Dananmen first, it is better to call him here first, to discuss the solution while waiting for the workers' representatives. This way we can avoid ... avoid ... additional problems..."</p>

<p>A Economic View on Nudity by Bin Fu</p>
<p>The call for nudity has spread from Hong Kong to Shanghai. In Shanghai, a wide-ranging nudity movement may soon be realized. Perhaps the bustling men, women, young and old, crowding Nanjing Road and Fourth Avenue will all be naked "models."</p>
<p>In today's "rapidly advancing" Chinese society, the outdated "ethical" shackles have long been discarded, and the Chinese nation is a natural lover of art. This nudity movement, rich in artistic value, cannot resist the shout of artistic young men and women, and it is certain that it will achieve widespread success. However, from an economic point of view, if the nudity movement is once realized and universally realized, I will cry out for the shareholders, bosses, and staff of foreign cloth shops and silk shops.</p>
<p>I remember that in the late nineteenth century, the famous British missionary Henry Morton Stanley made such a speech in the Manchester Chamber of Commerce: "If we can introduce European culture and Christian doctrine into the Congo and make the barbaric naked Congolese know to cover their bodies with clothes, then just calculating the clothes they wear every Sunday, our Manchester cotton cloth can have an additional sales volume of 320 million yards; if the natives can wear clothes every day, then we can have an additional income of 26 million pounds every year." Conversely, if today's "artistic youths" bring the naked art of foreigners to Shanghai, just calculating the clothes saved by millions of civilized people in Shanghai, each of whom only has one set of clothes, because they are naked, is already considerable. What's more, the modern girls and young ladies and dignitaries in Shanghai all have several or even hundreds of thousands of beautiful clothes. Wouldn't all the foreign cloth shops and silk shops in Shanghai close their doors and do nothing?</p>
<p>Incidentally, if the nudity movement is universally implemented, the song and dance troupes in cinemas that specialize in "sex appeal" and "sensuality" will disappear, because the land is full of naked women, and song and dance troupes can no longer use the "scarce commodity" of "sensuality" to attract customers, and the "sensuality economy" planned by the cinema will also decline.</p>
<p>I can't bear to imagine the danger and tragedy after the implementation of the nudity movement. The unemployed group will increase the staff of foreign cloth shops and silk shops; the turbulent Huangpu River will have more young people committing suicide; I can't bear to imagine the ridiculousness after the implementation of the nudity movement, the naked men and women crowded in the long snake-like trams; a few "naked mannequins" dozing off on the counters of the deserted foreign cloth shops.</p>
<p>Isn't that right? A few days ago, the leaders of the foreign cloth and silk industries have submitted a letter to the authorities requesting a "ban on the nudity movement." Although the surface reason is "ethical," who dares to say that his motive is not necessarily economic!</p>
<p>The Art of Climbing the Social Ladder by Bu Denglong</p>
<p>England has a famous mathematician and philosopher, and his name is known even in China. He is Russell. But now we have a mathematician and writer in China, or more precisely, a mathematician turned writer. I can't remember his name clearly, but I know roughly that he once received the baptism of Eastern education.</p>
<p>See what you can do to me! Armistice Agreement</p>
<p>He was suddenly happy, and instead of writing his good at textbook on arithmetic, he wrote a book called "The Art of Being a Dog," with tens of thousands of words. His method of publishing is to only sell pre-orders and not sell single copies. The pre-order price is one yuan for type A, limited to 500 copies, and eight jiao for type B, limited to 1,000 copies. If all the pre-orders are sold out, this "Art of Being a Dog" can get a total of 1,300 yuan. It's really a good business.</p>
<p>I've wasted my life to this age, and I've read countless Chinese and Western books, [not bragging], but I've never bought a pre-order once. This is not because I don't believe in pre-orders, but because I love to read a book, and I like to buy it immediately. This is called seeing it first for pleasure, and the poor scholars don't care about the price of the book.</p>
<p>So, how could that "Art of Being a Dog" that only sells pre-orders and not single copies make a sale with me who only buys single copies and not pre-orders? To tell you the truth, this is because I temporarily believed in humor too much. The advertisement for "The Art of Being a Dog" was first published in "The Analects," but the first advertisement did not announce the author's name. Therefore, I suspected that the book was written by someone from the "Analects" faction, and there must be many humorous things in the book, so I bought a pre-order book for the first time in my life.</p>
<p>After one extension, "The Art of Being a Dog" was finally published. The printing and binding of the book are quite elegant, but the content is terrible. Copper foreign coins, scattered dishes, garbage and old goods are all mixed together, superficial and bland, plus a few seemingly witty but actually not witty words, it can be said to be extremely boring and can only be appreciated by rustic country bumpkins. This may be the art of climbing the social ladder by climbing the social ladder.</p>
<p>Communication with Store Employees Editor;</p>
<p>You are our guide in the wilderness; now I have a very difficult thing to solve, please ask the teacher, I hope you won't refuse! The thing is like this; because my family is in financial difficulties, I had to come to this dark and sinister society to solve my life problems after graduating from elementary school. Later, thanks to the introduction of a neighbor, I came to work as an apprentice in a hardware store! Last month, two incidents of missing money occurred in the store. I don't know how, but their suspicion was focused on me personally. Although there is no real evidence, they can't make things difficult for me; but the cold words and sarcasm are really a bit unbearable; and</p>

<p>On the Shenqiu Day, I and Mr. Xu Fuyin painted. Xu, named Fuyin, was from Haiyan. He once followed Mr. Li Zuishi and traveled with Mr. Chaoran, etc., and his art became more advanced. His landscape paintings captured the desolate charm of the Yuan people.</p>
<p>Can someone who has lost this kind of trust still stand in society? Alas! Perhaps this is the reason why my family is in financial difficulties! I have long admired the teacher's profound knowledge and learning, and I am sure that you can give me a satisfactory answer. I respectfully wish you good health!</p>

<p>Editor's note; Harming the reputation of others is a violation of criminal law. Your colleagues look down on people because of your poor family, and under the circumstances of no supporting evidence, they make groundless accusations and suspect that you are a thief; and further make cold and sarcastic actions. Don't say that you can't bear it, even we third parties feel dissatisfied when we hear it. In theory, you should meet them in court. However, this kind of cold words and sarcasm, mostly can't catch evidence, so you can't accuse them based on it; besides, even if you win, it is forced, and you can't prohibit them from suspecting you in their hearts. Therefore, this kind of method can't be done among colleagues. Speaking of a store, this kind of missing money can't be handled sloppily. All the people in the store have the responsibility to try their best to find out the truth. What's more, you are now under this kind of unclear suspicion, you should work hard to track it down. Once you can capture the real thief, not only will the current suspicion be cleared, but you will also be especially valued by the person concerned!</p>

<h3>Financial Affairs: Silver Futures, Stocks, and Commodity Prices Suddenly Surge, Standard Silver Plummets to 9.97 Yuan</h3>
<p>(Exchange Market Unusually Slack, Buyers Helpless)</p>
<p>(New Low Price of 825.2 Yuan)</p>
<p>The gold market is prone to both rises and falls. Yesterday, it suffered a disastrous fall again, hitting a new low of 825.2 yuan (approximately equivalent to 190 taels of silver). In the morning, although silver prices in England and the United States fell, forward silver prices on the Five Metals Exchange rose sharply by 7.5 li. Although England and the United States decreased, British and American [prices] continued to see substantial increases. American cotton rose 0.26 pound units, American wheat rose more than one cent, and stocks rose more than two yuan. Raw silk prices immediately fell. Fook Cheong, Bing Hing, Wing Lee, Chuen Yuen, and Wing Yuen Hing came to sell, and the price went even lower. After the opening, the exchange market was slack and flooded with currency, and banks were unable to stop pushing out money, so the gold market fell. In the afternoon, market sentiment worsened further, and sellers were unusually excited. Bombay initially telegraphed a decline of two annas, and then continued to drop another anna, with only a slight rebound. But the domestic market became increasingly rigid, and the price fell to 95.2 yuan. It was a miserable day, and buyers were helpless, with a sense of impending doom. There were reports from foreign telegrams of a reduction in the gold fineness and the success of loans. The front market fell, and there was news from the mainland of sales of US dollars. The afternoon market plunged further. Major players like Fook Cheong sold [silver] right from the morning opening, and Cheong Shing Wing also sold more than a thousand bars. A speculator named Mr. Wu reportedly sold a considerable amount, with the cost of fire insurance adding 150 yuan. The market situation for the whole day is recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opened at 846 yuan, down 11.4 yuan from the previous close. Goods opened at 6 yuan. The exchange market opened with the British [exchange rate] flat and the American [exchange rate] slack. Recent selling prices for British exchange were 1 shilling and 3 pence, and for American exchange, 28.1875 yuan. Wing Yue Yuen Mao Wing Chun made a reappearance and sold down from 7.5 yuan gradually, Shun Lee selling to within 5 yuan, Cheong Shing Wing and Chiu Fung Cheong sold to within 4 yuan, because the exchange market continued to become rigid, Heng Tai, Yee Fung, Wing Chuen Yuen, Wing Chee Fung Wing even sold to 1.5 yuan. Although the Ningbo guild absorbed [some silver], Da Tak Shing, Da Hing, Wing Chee Fung Wing still supplied [the market]. October American dollars, China Exchange, had already settled at 93.75, and</p>
<p>receded to 1.2 yuan. HSBC's listed prices revealed British [exchange rate] flat and American [exchange rate] up by half a yuan. At this time, [the price] struggled around 2 yuan. After entering [the market], the exchange market remained rigid, Mitsui, China Exchange,</p>
<p>again settled October [American dollars] at 90 yuan, Yat Cheong, Fook Yue, Yee Fung, Wing Shui Hong, Yuen Shing Wing sold at 38 yuan. Pan Gen Pa took October [American dollars] at 0.0625, with a slight increase, but Da Hing Wing came to sell, again to 8.3 yuan, then Heng Hing, Fook Cheong, Heng Yue scrambled to buy at low prices, Mitsui Pa took October at 0.125, once rebounding to 41.8 yuan, but because of continued weak sentiment and a slack exchange market, Wing Heng, Yuen Chun, Fook Cheong, Da Hing Wing, Da Fat Wing, Heng Hing, Yuen Shing Wing, etc. sold together. Although Mitsui offered October [American dollars] at 0.1815, there were still few buyers at 0.25 at this time, so it retreated to 35.3 yuan.

Ultimately, banks absorbed [currency] slightly at low prices, but the underlying trend remained rigid. In the afternoon, [the exchange market] continued to be sluggish. Foreign telegrams sent news that the mainland was seeking to settle gold yuan, and the trend hardened step by step. Although Bombay reported two consecutive declines, it was difficult to change the situation. Banks were extremely eager to sell. As of the close, the immediate selling prices for British exchange were 1 shilling 3 pence 0.0125, and for American exchange 29 yuan, with British [exchange rates] 0.00125 harder and American [exchange rates] 1.0625 yuan slacker compared to the previous close.

<h3>Idle and Tedious Call Loan Market</h3>
<p>For days, both the silver and money industries have been characteristically idle and tedious due to the summer off-season. Therefore, the call loan market has experienced absolutely no rise or fall whatsoever. Yesterday's morning and afternoon markets were both at 7%, and the closing rates had no added premium and were generally conducted as flat settlements. Currently, although receipts and disbursements are low, the business situation for transactions is substantially devoid of other important news worthy of record aside from a small number of goods and foreign exchange. Call loan transactions: morning market transfers over 4.8 million, new transactions 400,000-500,000, afternoon market transactions over 400,000, small general association transactions over 500,000, foreign mortgage transactions over 800,000, banknote recalls and issuances over 1.1 million, passenger route shipments of new currency 300,000, bank receipts and disbursements of merchant-related receipts and disbursements 1.2 million in silver dollars and over 1.7 million in foreign currency, special appropriation receipts and disbursements 1.4 million in silver dollars, and miscellaneous</p>

<h3>Securities Ascend to a New Level, All Bonds Reaching New High Prices</h3>
<p>│The Entire Sixth Issue Rises in Value by as Much as 2.67 Yuan│</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Hua Shang Securities Exchange suddenly experienced an unexpected surge in prices. The afternoon trend was extremely robust. As a result of many days of brewing, short sellers were once again greatly disappointed. The majority of bond markets saw new high prices again, which was beyond the expectations of the short side. The market atmosphere was particularly robust, with investor confidence rising to an unparalleled degree. The Entire Sixth Issue was especially favored, as the measures have been comparatively superior since the Finance Bureau's revisions. Therefore, the demand was particularly high. The majority of these transactions involved investment accounts, so it was not easy to suppress [the price]. Although the market price of other types [of bonds] was at least approaching 60% [of face value], the supply of chips was visibly dwindling, and the bulls were unwilling to let go easily. There was still the possibility of continued gains in the future. The majority of the market viewed the Salt Tax [bonds] at 55 yuan; let us observe the subsequent developments. When the market opened yesterday morning, the Northern group heavily sold 96 [bonds] for a minor profit of jiao. The other types were slightly better by about 0.02 yuan, and the trend was extremely robust. The second round still belonged to a situation where demand exceeded supply, and continued to improve by 0.02-0.03 yuan. 96 [bonds] returned up 0.04 yuan because the Northern group had stopped selling. The Entire Sixth Issue rose 0.05 yuan on its own. In the afternoon, there was a rumor in the market that the British loan had been successfully established, and short sellers suddenly panicked. The Disbandment suddenly surged by half a yuan, and the price increases of the other types were even more intense. It was truly commendable that this wild surge occurred during the current high-peak market. The Entire Sixth Issue was especially robust, with a sudden increase of 2 yuan in one round. Before the close, the various issues listed in the front rose by about 1 yuan, and the issues listed later rose slightly by 0.02-0.03 yuan. The trend was extremely robust, and there was no sign of a fallback in the future. As a result of the market price, it rose by 0.07-0.08 yuan to 1.07-1.08 yuan, and the Entire Sixth Issue rose by as much as 2.67 yuan. The total number of transactions was 18,598,500 yuan, including 3,500 yuan in spot goods, and a total of 6,825,000 yuan in term Salt Tax, Disbandment accounted for 1,660,000, the 19-year Customs Duty accounted for 2,230,000, the 20-year, 20-year Customs Duty accounted for 3,050,000, the 96 [bonds] accounted for 3,160,000, and the remainder ranged from 400,000 to 500,000.</p>
<h3>New York Stocks Stable</h3>
<p>A report from New Fung Foreign Firm: On Thursday (the 6th), the New York stock market initially fluctuated due to bulls taking profits, then generally anticipated good railroad freight reports and operating reports, and because the World Economic Conference decided to continue, railroad stocks still advanced first, and all stocks also turned up. The transaction was unusually smooth at the close. The teleprinter lagged the market by seventeen minutes. In summary, the total transaction volume for the day was 6,540,000 shares. Predictions are that the market will continue to rise, and that stocks such as oil, appliances, and brewing are especially likely to perform well. The report of rain in the Northwest offset the wheat damage. Later, upon hearing the news that the World Economic Conference had decided to continue, the number of purchases increased in the afternoon, and the trend turned firm. As a result, [the price] rose one cent compared to the previous day. There were not many buyers of American cotton due to rain in the drought area, but it rose approximately 0.25 pound units due to the influence of the British exchange rate. Furthermore, according to the Steel Century Report, the steel output this week increased to 56%, the highest peak since March 24, 1931. All industries had orders, with the automotive industry having the greatest need. A number of factories were fully operating but still unable to keep up with demand. The brokers' loans announced yesterday totaled 905,000,000 yuan, an increase of 94,000,000 yuan compared to the previous week. The 60-day interest rate was 0.75%, and the 90-day rate was 1.25%.

<p>Yarn and Raw Cotton: Raw Cotton Market Dull and Listless</p>
<p>The yarn market was flat in the morning and fell in the afternoon, with the situation dull and listless. But the overseas cotton market rose, and the gold price fell back, so market sentiment softened. The actual needs of the market were still clear. All the gangs lacked vitality. The factory convened a general meeting of all members at 3 pm to discuss a method to stop night work, the results of which have not yet been released.</p>
<p>(Manchurian Standard Initially Firm, Then Exhausted)</p>
<p>The Manchurian Standard front market opened, rising slightly in line with foreign cotton by 0.02-0.03 yuan. In the afternoon, it was heard that actual sales were not smooth, and the majority of [people] expected that the factory's suspension of night work would be unlikely to become a reality, so market sentiment remained weak, and the market mood was quite exhausted. Each month fell by 0.06-0.09 yuan. The full-day transaction statistics were 27,300 bales. Checking the sales, Sui Lung sold 1,100 bales, Wing Cheong 900 bales, Shun Cheong 1,050 bales, Yun Fung 700 bales, and the purchases were: Cheung Fung 1,100 bales, Chun Tai 1,000 bales, Tai Fung 850 bales, and Kat Fung 800 bales.

<h3>Old Cotton is Severely Short of Spot Goods</h3>
<p>The market for old cotton is exceptionally tight because there is a shortage of spot goods, and buyers' intentions to buy are firm, so market sentiment is quite strong. However, since the weather is good for new cotton, and although foreign cotton prices have risen, the sharp drop in gold prices means that the accounting has not changed much. According to one group in the afternoon, the area of cotton fields in the United States has not decreased, and there were more sellers of distant months, so [the price] fell. (Zhengzhou Standard Near Months Rise, Distant Months Fall)</p>
<p>The Zhengzhou Standard front market opened, rising with foreign cotton, and the market situation was still good, with each month rising 0.01, 0.02, 0.03 yuan.
