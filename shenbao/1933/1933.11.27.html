<p>美蘇復交。僅表示遠東局勢之日形緊張。影響所及。不過使日本侵路政策益趨於迂迴曲折之途而止。其理由昨已略言之矣。顧此兩大國家於政治經濟極端相反的立場下。一朝携手之後。則對於中國市場以内經濟支配戰爭之變動。又將發生若何影響乎。似亦當加以相當之研究。夫今日遠東糾紛之根本癥結。實在乎一般帝國主義間。在遠東支配市場均勢之力不能維持。如太平洋委任統治問題。如印度市場問題。皆此種現象之反映。但僅爲局部之事實。若我中國市場支配權之爭奪。則實爲此種根本癥結之中心。彼日本者向以東亞之盟主自命。縱以美蘇復交之故。或能微斂其領土侵略之雄心。然决不能稍遏其變相的經濟侵略之懷抱。是則可爲斷言者也。</p>

<p>廣東海眞罷工後、太古公司曾一再換請代表進行斡旋、結果以工人要求賠償損失四十萬元、公司未能同情、致難解决、同時因工人封銷港口、故太古公司於七月間放棄廣東航線、所有滬粤班新疆·山東濟南·頴州·等十七輪、均各改換航線、</p>

<p>太古公司曾一再請粤五省外交處甘介侯及怡和大班等出任調停、因港粤問之航線、爲太古南華班之主力、故太古自佛山輪全體工人　工後、即另造一輪定名爲新佛山、其航線仍爲粤港間、太古首先讓步、接納工人要求、惟對工人所提之六項辦法中之過苛者、要求修改、海員亦接受調停人之勸告、步步退讓、</p>

<h3 id="c221">上海銀行事業發皇之原因魏友棐 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>一</p>
<p>二年來上海有一種顯明的趨向，卽爲銀行事業的發皇，北京路和寗波路，擬之爲上海之華爾街，固不必諭，卽如由次向北的四川路新閘一帶，向西的靜安寺路，以及八仙橋一帶，都有隨處都是銀行的趨勢。這種現象，究竟是金融資本的過乘呢？還是　商業社會的迫切需要呢？</p>
<p>新起的銀行，其資本額大體是不大，由五十萬元至一百萬元爲最多，勢力並不雄厚，而營業項目大體相似。這許多銀行的開設，因目前市情的反映，當然要使人疑慮其營業要點是否將趨於衝突的一點，這便是本文的動機。</p>
<p>上海銀行事業所以發皇的原因，簡單地說，是游資集中於上海。因爲上海是一個都市，是一個特殊的都市，自政府建都南京以來，他在經濟上的地位，更使其日臻於重要。進出口交易，要經過上海，　欵要來上海，證劵的重心，要看上海，滙兌的市價，要看上海，造幣廠和中央銀行的幹部，也還是在上海。惟其如是，就是使銀行事業麕集的先端了。如果就游資集中的原因分析起來，則</p>
<p>農業上的原因財貨的産地；由於工業和農業。我國是以農立國的，力農人口佔全國總人口百分之八十。這多數的農民，都是靠農産物維持其生計。連年荒歉，釀成農村破産，使農村的失業者增多，危及農村的治安，向來蟄居農村中的資産階級，因農村衰落的關係，不特其身家有日見降落的現象，就是於其財産安全一點來說，也有陷落的恐　。而且治安上發生問題，政費和軍費旣須增加，因農村地段的荒僻故，這些僅有的資産階級的負担就不得不加重。在收人一方面說，是日就减削了；就支出方面來說，又有加大的趨向，這足以爲驅資産階級離農村，加入上海集團的重要原因。他們搬到上海，不但可以避重就輕，而且因爲上海的特殊情形之故，其身家性命，也就可以高枕無憂，這種情形的持續，就益足以促成農村的衰落，使兩方成爲極度相反的背馳情形。</p>
<p>工業上的原因我國是無所謂工業的，什麽都在資本帝國主義的侵略下掙扎着。所謂民族工業的絲廠，以及紗廠，那一業不是在困苦顚沛之中？就是所用的原料，也差不多全是仰人鼻息。近年來農村哀落，農作物減少，絲棉事業的破産，使農民和工業兩方都感到痛苦。農民一方在生産，他方卽爲消費者。因爲生計的困迫，使一般的購買力都低下，再以列强資本主義的就近層層剥削，自營的工廠受了厄運就永無曙光。爲了工業上的打擊，使一般資本家，本將全力從事於工業之進取的，現在因鑒於時勢，就不得將這些資本變成游資。破産的破産，未破産的鑒於成事而中止他的奮鬭，因此金融成一種呆滯的狀態。本年度自從開始以來，而每日市塲利率只在五六分之間盤旋，這種狀態，就足以示資金活動之無方，爲向來所少見的。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>這些游資如何運用呢？開工廠是不可能的了，辦商業呢，各處的荒災匪區，實使一般商人蹙額。在他們靜待機遇的時機，這就是想將資金於可以活動之地。同時呢，要不失其爲商人領袖的地位，以擴張自已勢力。要具備這兩種條件的，只有辦金融事業。</p>
<p>商店公司的股東權限是有限的，而可經營者則少，至於舊式商店，股東尤其無直接增高地位之效能；所以只有金融事業具備兩種特長。在需用欵項的時候，可以設法向自已的銀行貸欵，一方可以生息，資金也不至於呆淮。而且同時，如果金融勢力的潜長，是爲事業和聲勢的後盾。</p>
<p>辦金融事業有二條路，一條辦錢莊，而一條是辦銀行，可是辦錢莊的困難比銀行爲多。這原因也很容易說明的。錢莊是舊式組織，股東的責任爲無限，責任重，而股東的權限小。這是一。其次，錢莊的股東須有實力爲後盾，在金融警戒期間，尤須股東之力量以應付之。如此，錢莊股東的股份不能過于零碎。通常只有十股，股東人數則至多不過四五人。此四五人不特要有雄厚的資産和聲望，尤須有一種「兜得轉」的本領，所以做錢莊股東，在資本家一方面說，是易于受累的。而銀行則不是如此。幾百元一個股東，合許多小股東，就使大股東的地位格外種固。銀行大股東，任董事的希望大，可以使他自已有雄厚的勢力。如果一看市　好了，他更可以發展自已特長，去經營某項企業。資金不足，就可以向自已銀行週轉，恐怕要比未開銀行之前還要來得流動。所以錢莊是大企業家的集合，而銀行則是合許多小企業者而扶植成一大企業者。</p>
<p>時游資辦銀行，在資本家方面，爲資本求出路，自已的地位固然可以增高，還可以得相當利殖，並可以位置許多失業者，誠是最適當的處置辦法了。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>從上文說，旣然現實經濟社會是這一種形態，那末，金融業者從何處榨取利殖呢？金融業者的最大目標，是將收入資金而加以運用。普通的原則是放欵。可是照目前狀况，工商業需要放欵，而金融業者則有所戒而不敢輕于一逞，因此閙成一個僵局。上海銀行界營業之出路凡二：</p>
<p>第一項是營公債國家在財政拮据當兒，往往藉發公債爲唯一出路。我們知道公債的利息比普通放欵爲優厚，又知公債之發行者爲政府，他是本利的支付，是有妥實的担保的，足以安一般金融資本家之心，這尤爲其優於普通放欵之處。所以政府以此爲策劃政務之途，銀行亦藉此爲投資唯一之方法。銀行業者又恐收利之不漙，乃收集零星的存欵，而躉爲公債之經營。在一方得利者是銀行，而他方失利者是政府。政府財政的來源是人民，所以銀行的利潤，卽暗中取之于人民。實際需要放欵的工商業者反不得實惠，這是一種畸形的發展、于企業前途是不利的。</p>
<p>第二項是營地産農材破産了，富豪與游資都不約而同地薈集於上海，僑民的人口有加多之傾向，租界人口膨脹，因而促成上海地價之飛漲。又因資本家之競爭故，使地産昇漲之勢加足其速度。金融業者利用這一點，就在注力公債之外，再從事于地産之購置。因銀行之瘋狂競購的緣故，地産的高漲加速，就在這飛漲之間，金融資本家得以坐享其利。金融資本家細碎地從存户方面搜集存欵，增厚資本勢力，而得以實行他的大規模的營利計劃。</p>
<p>商人是當然以營利爲目的的，金融業者自不能在商人之外尋出路。不過金融資本家的最大目標，决不在增殖自已的利潤，而其來源且出諸利用畸形的剥削。他們所恃之主要業務，前者是使政府人民兩方都處于不利地位，金融資本家承銷公債之勢力雄厚故，往往可以雄視一切。而後者尤足使金融周轉不靈時，自蹈呆需之地位。至眞正需要欵項接濟之工商業反一些不得實利，而且難見轉機。在什麽時候，我們的金融資本家，方才可以　向正規途上去呢？</p>

<p>今日銀行界業務上競爭的劇烈，爲無可諱飾的事實，對於吸收存欵，更是不遺餘力，名目繁多，花樣百出；例如敎育儲金，養老儲金·兒童儲金等和什麽提高利息，優先儲蓄，種種廣告上的宣傳，莫不爲吸收存欵的方法，平心而論，如果這種競爭，純爲業務上的競爭，而不含絲毫互相排斥·謗毁·妒忌的成分，在銀行因競爭而蓄意改進，力爲社會服務，在社會亦可運用自如，得不少的便利。不過我們若對銀行界細加觀察，便可發現一種缺憾，就是銀行對於婦女儲蓄缺乏相當的提倡，而對婦女界服務機會，還不多見。如果說，我國現有四萬萬同胞，那麽其中二萬萬是女同胞，退一步講，我們假定二萬萬女同胞中，祗有一部分是處境優越而有儲蓄的能力的，那麽集腋可成裘，這無數微弱的資金聚集在一起，就可成爲一枝强有力的生力軍；對實業方面作偉大的貢獻，誰能說這成效是微弱的呢！可惜我國的銀行界遂没有顧慮到這一層。</p>
<p>照普通的情形，在現今男子作中心的社會中，婦女職業雖還不過在萌芽時代，大部分的婦女雖還在管理家政仰賴丈夫的供給，然而婦女儲蓄的能力是並不缺乏的，無疑的，每個婦女都是每個家庭的管理者，她有操縱家庭經濟的權威，賦有管理家庭財政的特權，在日常的家庭費用中，如果稍稍節省一下，那麽要儲蓄起來是極容易的事，並且丈夫每月總有多少錢給予白已的妻子的，而女子對於金錢，大都是很珍重捨不得用去的，在這種情形下，可見婦女的儲蓄力確是極豐富的。至於一部分從事職業的婦女，無用說得，她們按月有相當的進欵，而在家庭中又不負多大經濟上的責任，所以儲蓄力更爲堅强。然而銀行對於婦女儲蓄不惟缺少提倡，抑且絶少適合於婦女儲蓄的設備。而婦女儲蓄的不發達，在社會上造成了兩種現象；種是極端的消費者，卽一般人所謂的摩登女性，在她們的腦海中，没有儲蓄的觀念，祇有虚榮盤踞在她們的心頭，所以服裝置都舉止闊綽，故消費丨簡直可以稱浪費丨浩大，當然是意中事。另一種是絶對的保守者，她們對於投資缺乏相當的知　，對於銀行存疑惑觀　的態虔而有點不大信在，覺得自已藏匿起來，才是處置私蓄最妥當的方法；她們這種處置法，是守種密的，除了自已之外，絶對不容第二人知悉，　　婦女，要以一般守舊的居多，因開通的亦不在少數。這兩種現象的婦女，嚴格地議，前者固然是助長社會奢侈的風俗，增加社會的消費，雖然消費同樣是生産，而减低國民的經濟力；就是後者將有用的資金打入牢獄，不使流通於社會，於實業商業方面，鄰無形减少一份經濟力，總而言之，都是發展國民經濟途徑上的大碍物。所以站在銀行的立塲上，對於消費者應該竭力提倡節儉儲蓄，並曉諭以儲蓄不惟有關個人一生之幸福，並且爲每個國民應盡的責任，良以銀行負有提倡節儉轉移社會奢侈風俗的使命，對於保守者也應力行勸導，使她們深切的明瞭銀行是怎樣爲社會服務的一種金融，而出其所蓄儲入銀行，無疑的，這種勸導也　銀行應盡的義務。可是現在的　行、大都是惑於目前的一點微利，而忽略了它偉大的使命，所以我們覺得婦女儲蓄的不發達，除了大多歡婦女不去和銀行接近外，在銀行本身亦不能辭其咎的。</p>
<p>在今後的銀行界對於婦安儲蓄不可再加忽視，除了分一部分力量來從事宣傳工作外，在可能的範圍中，銀行應設立婦女儲蓄部，雇用女行員專司其事，以謀與大衆婦女接近，這樣大多數婦女自然　　意和銀行往來了，而銀行業務的更形發達，亦爲必然的趨勢。我們想信婦女儲蓄發展後，把這一筆資金去救濟大部分缺乏個蓄力的婦女而使同樣的生出儲蓄力來，亦是很容易的事。再以振興實業，救濟農村何往不宣，所以在遂國民經濟程度衰落的年頭兒，社會現象反常的情形，銀行應該轉移它的目光，而對婦女儲蓄加以相當的注意。</p>

<p>（一）引言「恐慌」蓋爲一近代之名詞，乃工業革命之副産物十九世紀以來始爲人所注意。吾國以工業落後，在昔更無人過問，惟以年來國内實業頗形發展，據各方調查之結果，工人之數有如下者：</p>
<p>農工……八七、二一八、○○○人（申報年鑑）</p>
<p>工廠…一、四四五、○○○人（中國勞工年鑑）</p>
<p>礦工…二、二八九、○○○人（Ｔorgasheff）</p>
<p>交通工…一二九、○七三人（鐵部交部等）</p>
<p>手藝工二、八五○、○○○人（中國勞工年鑑）</p>
<p>共計九三、九三一、○七三人</p>
<p>據此則我國工人，數亦頗可觀，一旦生産失其調節，則其關係民生者必至鉅，且自一九二九年世界恐慌以起，造成普徧之失業狀態，吾國受其影響者亦復不淺，益覺恐慌問題之研究亟不容緩。然恐慌之内容綜錯繁複，非數語可以詳盡，各國且著有專書，本文以限於篇幅，僅能對於恐慌之原因，發展步驟影響及救濟政策作一概略之陳述。</p>
<p>（二）恐慌之起因原恐慌之所以起，乃由於生産與消費之不能均衡，自引用機器生産以來，發生工廠制度，採取精密之分工，利用大量之資本·原料·勞工·而生産大量之物品。此大量之物品，能確證其適合社會之需要乎？曰未必然也。生産者，多不明瞭市塲需要之狀况，輙以猜度得之，結果生産與消費乃漸形分離，生産量每超過或不及社會之消費量，在前者必致造成生産過剩，他方而形成低能之消費力，（ＵndersConsumption）於是物價必下落，商品充滯，信用破壞，金融混亂，整個之經濟社會爲之騷動而恐慌因以形成矣。</p>
<p>（三）恐慌之性質與發展之程序（一）性質恐慌有二特殊之性質：（Ａ）環循性…每隔十年左右，卽有一次恐慌産生，此誠屬一奇事，解釋者或以爲系由於太陽中黑點之作用，或謂係緣信用之循環而産生，然自一八七○年以後，其間隔期稍有變動，或七年，或五年，惟其具有循環性則無疑也。（Ｂ）間期嚴重性（ＤoublePulation）…恐慌更有一重要之特性，易爲人所抹殺者，卽每間一次，必有一番嚴重者發生。下表中之有Ｘ卽表嚴重之恐慌，尤以一九二九者爲最，實屬空前之現象：</p>
<p>Ｘ一八一八　一八二五</p>
<p>Ｘ一八三七　一八四七</p>
<p>Ｘ一八五七　Ｘ一八七三</p>
<p>一八八四　Ｘ一八九三</p>
<p>一九○三　Ｘ一九○七</p>
<p>一九二○　Ｘ一九二九（最重）</p>
<p>（二）發展程序恐慌之發生有其特定之步驟，約可分爲四時期！</p>
<p>（Ａ）繁榮時期丨恐慌發生之前，經濟社會必呈一活潑之現象，先是物價因需要激增而加高，新企業必應運而生；而舊企業惑於厚利，亦必大事擴充，人人咸抱樂觀之心理。際此時代，勞工之需要自亦增高，且以需要資本故，信用之制度必能發展，而利息亦必超過水平線之上。（Ｂ）財政恐慌時期丨前兹已言經濟社會之穩定，全持其能保持一均衝之發展。惟自物價　貴以來。生産事業大形擴展，現金爲生産者所吸收，貨幣之流通必感不足，各銀行或公司爲擴充資本或增多貨幣計，乃吸取存欵或濫發紙幣，及一旦發生擠兌或提欵事件，而銀行公司不能應付，則必致歇閉其營業，而形成貨幣之恐慌。（ＭonetoryCrisis）（如美國一八七三年ＪohnCook＆Co及一九○七之ＫnickerBocker＆Co之倒閉可爲例證）在生産者雖願繼續吸取資本，但投資者率爭相收回資本，，於是生産事業必致滯頗，而物價日以降跌。。（Ｄ）嚴重之恐慌時期丨物價旣已跌落，而生産者復不能吸取資本以爲彌補之策，其結果必致工廠停閉，惟工廠旣已停閉，則前此所用作生産之資本必入於休息狀態，充斥於市塲，其利息轉而降低。（Ｃ）復興時代丨生産事業停頓之後，物品之數量必日以减少，而社會上之需用不能與之俱减，以少量之物品供大量之需要，其價格當漸高漲，企業家見有利可圖，必再行投資，如是週而復始，完成一恐慌之環。</p>
<p>（四）物價之變動與恐慌恐慌之基本原因乃由於生産之過剩，而其所以表現於外者，則藉乎物價之漲落，故欲明恐慌之變動狀態，必先詳究物價變動之程序，按諸事實各種價格漲落未必同時，且其程度主料各有差異，兹列其程序於後：</p>
<p>（Ａ）晏債劵股票等…此類價格，感覺最敏，外界稍有剌激或變動，即有表現，如在去歲戰事時，稍形種靖，公債之價格卽飛漲，一旦緊張，則立卽下降。（Ｂ）批發價格丨其漲落之速度亦甚大，如外界需要稍形增高，其價即漲，反之則落。（Ｃ）零售價格丨其速度不及批發價格，因其與物價之關係較爲簡接也。（Ｄ）工資丨其漲落全視批發及零售價格以爲轉移（原因春後說明）。丨（Ｅ）長期契約丨此類漲落極慢，因受時間之限制也（如房租地租等）。</p>
<p>（五）恐慌與失業之關係恐慌與失業究有若何關係，吾人不難於前節價格變動之程序中得之，兹咯陳於後：</p>
<p>（Ａ）物價高漲時期丨依上列程序，物價高漲，生産者首蒙其利，而零售價格繼之以上升，工人之生活程序必致提高，其固有之工資必不數開支，進而要求增高，資本家以可獲利故，亦樂意分潤部份以提高工人之報酬，故在此時期内，勞資雙方均有利益。（Ｂ）物價跌落時期丨物價跌落，批發價格首當其衝，故資本家先蒙其害，繼之則零售物價下落，而工資之降跌追隨零售物價之後。驟視之此種程序頗形有利於工人，以其能享有廉價之物品也。然此種優勢，僅屬暫時，蓋以資本家旣無利可圖，則必中止其生産事業，工人遂流於失業。故物價跌落亦卽象徵失業之預示，而生産過剩又爲造成物價跌落與恐慌之主因，恐慌與失業之關係由此可以見矣。</p>
<p>（六）恐慌之救濟恐慌之救濟，可自兩方面觀察之，一卽擬定普遍之救濟法則，一即確立恐慌失業之拯救辦法。</p>
<p>（甲）一般之救濟辦法（一）放任政策…樂觀派之經濟學者，以及亞當斯密之理論亦可用之於救濟恐慌，蓋以恐慌之性質旣屬週期，有類天體之運行，非人力所可改變，且以人情論，一旦物價跌落，則生産者必自動停止生産久之物價必復漲，且眼力敏銳者，更可預爲防範，故恐慌實爲自然之一種淘汰，爲必要而不可少者，然徵諸事實，恐慌之來，乃使智愚同歸於盡，無分皂白，且恐慌卽屬爲一時的，若能並此短時期之不幸而避免之，豈不大有俾益於人類，故此法實不能稱善。（二）統制並限制生産事業丨恐慌之主因旣爲生産過剩，故消極方面宜加以節制，推行加答爾運動避免企業間之競爭與衝突，然後可以恊定價格，均分利益分配販路而不致有過剩之現象。（三）奬勵消費…恐慌一方面雖屬生産過剩，但另一方面則爲低能之消費，故宜設法增加人民之消費能力，其法不外（Ａ）减低物價，（Ｂ）分期付償物價，（Ｃ）提介合作作消費等。（四）增高外貨進口稅並實行傾政策於國内外，前者可以减省貨物之來源，後者可以與本國貨物以暢銷之機會。（五）燄定貨幣價格…生産之膨脹，有賴大量之貨幣，貨幣充斥，則生産者以低利貸入，以擴充其生産。同時信用貨幣之膨脹，亦有擾亂金融之危險，故宜限制貨幣流通之數量，以提高利息，則生産事業不致過於擴充，而恐慌亦以减少矣。</p>
<p>（乙）恐慌失業之救濟辦法，（一）確定生産之計劃丨在資本家應先考慮其生産之步驟，務使其得一平均之進展，以避免集中於某一期内，致形成該時期内之生産過剩，而致後一期之勞工失業。（二）縮短工作時間丨其作用一則可以使工人不致有閒怠或過勞之苦，一則可以使失業工人亦得工作之機會。譬之在昔一工人每日工作十二小時，而同時有一工人舞所工作，今若令前者工作七小時，則後者亦可得相當之工作矣。（三）改進職業敎育丨使工人能適應多種工作，卽或某種生産事棠因過剩而停頓時，仍可參加其他生産事業。（四）組織良善之職業介紹所丨以爲失業工人謀出路，此事業在我國尚未十分發達，廿年國民會議曾通過工人失業救濟案，其一卽爲在各都市設立工作介紹所·後實業部亦頒布介紹所條文，現已成立者有南京北平上海天津漢口青島廣州濟南各地之介紹所。（五）慈善事業丨津貼失業工人。（六）失業保險丨此制發原於比利時之根特城。故名ＧhentSystem，自後推行於各國，頗見成效。歌戰時曾一度消沉，惟戰後又甚形發展，吾國此制尚未見普偏實行，是政府應力爲提倡也。</p>
<p>以上將恐慌之關係作一概　，自輓近不景　發生以來，舉世惊惶，英知所措，　苟能精心研析，自不　得其端倪，亦不難施以救濟。美國之推克諾克拉西　濟學派，卽志在防止恐慌而使生産合理化，設其說之能行，寗得不謂人類之至幸乎？</p>

<p>— 蕭荻人</p>
<p>小朋友！我們的身體是不是比什麽部重要？是的吧？那末，我們將怎樣去保護它呢？現在蘇俄的小孩子們，他們是有着很好的保護自已的身體的方法的。他們不是去體育鍛鍊身子，也不是服欽補品調養身子，而他們是的，却是我們平素所不注意的呢！現在，我把它譯出來介紹在下面吧：</p>
<p>（一）不吃烟酒和辣椒，　（二）不吃腐敗的東西。</p>
<p>（三）不飲生水，　（四）不把手指含在嘴裏。</p>
<p>（五）不隨意撒大小便，　（六）不隨便吐痰。</p>
<p>（七）不手淫，　（八）不用手指亂搽眼睛。</p>
<p>（九）不亂吃露天擺賣的食品，　（十）不把尿桶擺在臥室裡。</p>
<p>（一）要將房子打掃乾凈，　（二）要天天刷牙洗澡。</p>
<p>（三）要常換衣服，　（四）要常　指甲。</p>
<p>（五）要撲滅蚊蟲，　（六）要撲滅蒼蠅。</p>
<p>（七）要常開房子的窗户，　（八）要常將手洗得乾凈。</p>
<p>（九）要打掃公共的地方，　（十）要練習早起床。</p>
<p>這裡面共計二十條，内分「不」字十個和「要」字十個，所以他們對這個就總稱爲十「不」和十「要」的護體運動。</p>
<p>小朋友！這是於我們身子很有益的，學着吧！</p>

<p>— 烟構</p>
<p>我到鄕間去吃喜酒，雖不是「前三後四」，可是也閙了四天。第一天喚做「下桌」，在初意是把正日所需的豬羊雞鴨，留下的不登大雅之堂的東西，像五臟六腑，飛蹤跳呌，都在先一天給親戚們大嚼一頓，所以稱下桌。可是現在不對啦，所置的菜，比正日還要豐盛美備。到了正日，無須絮咶，自然一日三餐，都是大塊肉，大條魚，大碗酒的大吃大喝。下一天是煖房，賀客出了一分禮，喚幾種雜要，閙了大半夜，這一頓的吃，和下桌差不多的，或者更要好一點。第四天謝帳房，雖不是廣請陪客，可是至親戚好，也輪得着的。所以辦一件喜事，吃是最重大的問題。竟有爲了主人的客嗇，或是招待不周，供應不及，若起賀客的不歡，可見吃的重要了。</p>
<p>本來燧人有樂昏之擾，吃是少不得的。可是像這們吃法，却兩方面都不實惠了。在主的一方面，費了許多的錢。在客的方面，驟然大吃大喝，於身體上說不定有些害處。但是一般人以爲非此不足以昭其隆重，吃的人越多，面子越大；吃的菜越好，塲面越闊。連新嫁娘也得多備些喜果，好應付閙新房的窘難，常聽見賀客在鄙夷地批評新嫁娘的支絀，好像少敬了一把瓜子，或是一枝香烟，於女海上就有老大的一個缺陷。「民以食爲天」。於此可見！</p>
<p>喜酒多吃一點，還是快活的事，可是喪事也得吃兩三天，更是奢不中禮了。我時常到喪家去，拜了幾拜，吃了一頓，抹抹嘴走了，自已也不明白是算什麽一回事。但是有許多喪家，正愁着吃的人不多，冷清清地一個大廳事上，只坐着七零八落的幾桌，怪難看的呢。</p>

<p>「中國人應用中國貨」</p>
<p>很大的標語，觸目驚心的瞥到張先生眼裏。</p>
<p>「當然，這是國民應盡的義務」張先生在想。</p>
<p>「嗄！」張先生在想，這夥計好糊塗。「此地是上海，不是東三省，恐怕没人肯穿了紫花布褲褂往馬路上跑」。</p>
<p>「今年是國貨年，吾們特别放盤。先生將就着試一試，我們慢慢改良」夥計又運用他招徠的手段。</p>
<p>張先生，畢竟被巧妙的生意經所征服，而挾了一疋杜布回去。同時還帶了一個疑問：「爲什麽不敎「貨來將就人」而要「人去將就貨」？</p>
<p>將出市場的時候，「中國人應用中國貨」很大的標語，又在張先生眼裏一瞥。張先生恍然了！</p>
<p>一·皮鞋舖中</p>
<p>「皮鞋舊了，應當買一雙。可是國貨皮鞋在那裏呢？」</p>
<p>探頭望腦的張先生，滿街找尋皮鞋店「這是大英皮的，我不要。這是東洋貨，我不要。我要買一雙眞正中國貨皮鞋」。張先生在一家皮鞋店裏這樣要求「有，有，純粹中國貨皮鞋，不過式樣差些」。夥計張羅着找出一雙烏測測的皮鞋給張先生。</p>
<p>「這是中國貨嗎？怎地難看，多少錢」？張先生在再三審察之後勉强問價。「四元八角」夥計囁嚅地說。「别嫌難看，倒是骨子貨」，又補充一句。</p>
<p>「那大英皮的，不是寫着四元二角嗎。怎麽粗牛皮的倒貴」？</p>
<p>「這是國貨呀」夥計愼重地說，附帶來一個神秘的笑。</p>
<p>「没有再好一些的嗎」？</p>
<p>「這是頂好的國貨，再要好，除非來路貨」。</p>
<p>「得啦！没奈何將就用吧」張先生在「將就」裏頭付出了四元八角的代價。</p>
<p>二·國布場内</p>
<p>「先生，這是中國原料，中國製造，的著名杜布。可要買一些」？</p>
<p>「這不是紫花布嗎？可有别的顔色？幅面也太狹」。</p>
<p>「先生，這是東三省最盛銷的國布，很結實……」</p>

<p>第十九回　欲卽欲離同車憶往事　半哭半笑倚枕病殘秋</p>
<p>在他這樣猶豫的時候，積之可就看出神氣來了，因道：這裏面有候車室，我們到那裏去坐着談談，好嗎？桂枝站定了，向着他臉上注視了一會，眼皮一撩，才微笑道；二爺到那裏去？積之道；自然是到海甸去。二人說着話。已經走進了候車室。因爲時間還早，屋子裏一個人都没有，桂枝也不知是何緣故，臉上却跟着又是一陣通紅。走到房門口，遲疑了一會子，作個要進不進的樣子。積之先在一張長椅子上坐了，見桂枝要來不來的神氣，便也站了起來，淡笑着道；没關係。這候車室裏不分男女，都是在這裏等車子的。桂枝心裏想着，若是不進去，未免讓積之臉上難看，就大大方方的走了進來坐着。積之慢慢的在身上掏出烟捲火柴來，慢慢的抽着，又慢慢的噴出兩口烟，却一點聲不曾做。桂枝坐在那裏，將衣服襟擺牽扯了兩下，又咳嗽了兩聲，才依然坐下。積之噴過了幾口烟之後，倒是想出了一句扼要的話來了。他笑道；大姑娘，我們不像以先作街坊那樣熟識，現在生分的多了。桂枝笑了一笑，却没有答復他這一句話。積之道；朋友都是這樣的，天天在一處，感情自然會好起來。若是彼此老不見面，很好的感情，也就會喪失掉了。桂枝笑道；朋友的感情，總是朋友的感情，天天見面，不過如此，十年不見面，也不過如此。積之道；那是對了的，天天見面，也不過如此，可是想起以前的事，我們好像不止是朋友的感情就完了。他說到了這裏，眼睛可就向桂枝身上瞟了一眼，看看他的顔色如何？（二五○）</p>

<p>— 朱戮</p>
<p>我在立冬的幾天，因着勞碌丁些，而工作方面，雖辛苦備當，可是不要說不求有功，連求無過都不可能。因此精神上就不免感到痛苦，加着這時湖號上市，正是脂黃充盈，恰到好處，貪了口腹，却引起了咯血舊症。我在十七歲上，本已吐過一次血，後來在鈺兒夭亡的當兒，又重發過一次，可是這兩次咯血，都祇吐了幾口，睡了幾天，吃了些「益精草」等藥物，就逐漸停止，這次却特别兇險，節一天一賶，就吐了一茶盞滿滿的鮮血，中醫的煎藥，服下去旣毫無效騐，西醫的皮膚針，連打兩針，也林毫不生功效，一連兩天，足足賶了四盞鮮血。那時我的妻，驚悸得喪了魂魄，我呢也不禁恐怖起來。死，在我這飽經憂患的身子，假使就此一瞑不視，倒也是絶大解脫，不過貧賤夫妻，絲毫没有積蓄的我，在平日非挺起胸口向前幹，一日不做，就有一日發生問題的苦况，血雖然這們一盞盞的吐，可是神志兀是十分清醒，眼瞧着這鮮紅的血，雜念紛起，想到身後，想到身後種種，正是不堪設想。幸虧第三天西醫的一針靜脈針，打到血液裏後週身出了一身熱汗，才把血止住了，可是三天飲食不進，耳鳴頭暈，已疲倦不堪。</p>
<p>我是個失業的人，靠着筆桿兒，一月月的硬幹。把筆尖見寫下的稿費，持來維兩口子的家庭費用；所以說也悽慘，平日間布衣菜飯，已覺十分艱難。我家庭的生活費，是量人爲出的，所以平日間凡可節省的地方，總是竭力節省；衣着不必論了，飲食方面，也是極力撙節的，可是這次咯血之後，爲了滋補關係，天天魚肝油，鷄汁，鷄蛋，豆乳等吃着。菜肴方面，也是豚蹄肥鴨，大早口福，恢復了幼年時公子哥兒的享用。但一介措大，竟享着富人口福，未免太含滑稽意味。可是醫生是這般囑付也祇好强自遵從，來日的經濟問題，祇好暫時不問「魚肝油」，據說對於肺病的滋補，是最有效力的。可是清魚肝油，是這般的腥而油，在胃口不佳的我，確是吃不進去。乳白魚肝油，也不容易吃，我吃的魚肝油，是麥精魚肝油。不過國貨的大力牌麥精魚肝油，那一層清魚肝油，兀自浮在麥精上面，腥油氣息，依然存在，「解伯勒魚肝油一，滋味是好吃了，可是三元四角一瓶的魚肝油，祇好吃半個月，在經濟困難的我，金錢方面，又委實有欲吃不能的實在情形。這次咯血之後，承畏友程小青先生敎我一個自製麥精魚肝油的方法，製法旣很容易，價值也特别便宜，味道雖没有「解伯勒」的好吃，可是比大力牌的魚肝油，却好吃多了。不敢守秘，特寫着告我同病的人。</p>
<p>那製法是十分容易的，先取三分之二的麥精，（卽麥糖，俗稱凈糖）。加半分清水，在文火上煮二十分鐘。在糖煮沸的當兒，用捧將水搗和，然後傾人别的器具裏；先冷五分鐘，然後把三分之一的魚肝油傾入，盡力擢匀，須俟糖質凝冷，才可住手。在製好的當兒，再加些果子精，那製就的魚肝油，就清香可口了。這法兒說穿了，是十分容易，不過有一個小小訣竅，就是在加入魚肝油的當兒，必須先可等糖冷了五分鐘後，才好加人；否則趁熱倒下，無論怎樣擾調，油是浮在上面，糖是澱在底下，永遠不會混好了。並且這自製的魯肝油五磅清魚肝油，加十磅麥精，二磅清水，足足可製十七磅麥精魚肝油，而他的價值，却祗有四元左右，眞比什麽滋補品，多要便宜哩！</p>
<p>周瘦鵑先生聽得我咯血，特地來看我，並且還傳了一個丹方。那方子是海上友人謝鵬飛先生處傳來的，據說治肺病，很有效力，並且手續也很簡單。那方法：是先取老藕一段，將蓋切斷，在藕孔裏加七成冰糖，將蓋裝好，竪着埋在米裏，過了一週時，然後將藕取出，那時藕已塢得軟軟的，藕孔裏的冰糖，也已化了糖汁，傾了出來，喝起來甜味中帶着清香，確是很好吃的。不過那藕下端，須將藕節留着，否則糖汁是要沁出來的。我這次咯血，承許多朋友照拂，眞使我十分感激，先在這裏道謝。</p>

<p>— 汪企張</p>
<p>話又說回來了。現在我們且就吳市長等　起的</p>
<p>預防癆病會講吧。這個事業。非同小可。歐美各國</p>
<p>。他們對於這類的事業費。每年不知要化幾千百萬</p>
<p>。目下這樣　困的我國。試問從何着手呢。這裏就</p>
<p>我個人的管見。以爲第一步。還宜從社會敎育的宣</p>
<p>傳人手。爲什麽呢。因爲衛生事業。政府不過做個</p>
<p>指導和規劃者。說到實在工作的質最。决不是幾個</p>
<p>官吏。和少數技術人員能力所及。還宜依賴民衆的</p>
<p>合作。而民衆的能否合作。亦决不是法令刑罰。所</p>
<p>可拘束。所以衛生常職的灌輸。便呈使民衆了解此</p>
<p>種工作的眞理。而瞭然樂於合作。那末舉措設施。</p>
<p>易收事半工倍之效。比方像清道。是市政上一部的</p>
<p>種要工作。現在上海市的衛生工作。也不算不努力</p>
<p>了。但是清清潔潔的道路上。有些腦子的人們。當</p>
<p>然不會去蹧蹋。然而牆邊屋角。到處還是垃圾·尿</p>
<p>屎·紙張·菜皮等亂抛亂撤。馬路中間的不蹧蹋。</p>
<p>也許是畏法。怕警察干涉罰錢。而他的心中。還是</p>
<p>一百個不如意。恐怕還怪當局的多事哩。我們覺得</p>
<p>這種不徹底的衛生工作。和預防事業。不過麻得個</p>
<p>陽奉隂違的結呆。覺得太不合算。然而工作方面。</p>
<p>已不勝其勞苦了。這都是民衆衛生常識。不足的緣</p>
<p>故。因此我覺得目下預防勞病。是要緊的。是社員</p>
<p>敎育宣傳工作。</p>
<p>癆病的傳染蔓延。雖不擇階級。可是貧民方面</p>
<p>。即無産階級。比較的更難防止。因爲衛生和預防</p>
<p>疾病設施。常和經濟力有連帶關係。因此。衣食住</p>
<p>乃至適當治療上。在有産階級。比較易於改良和處</p>
<p>置。但是對於常識問題。我國國情。不同一班。照</p>
<p>各國的常例。敎育必隨資産爲歸依。無産階級。因</p>
<p>無敎育費。所以不免智識淺陋。能力薄弱。中産以</p>
<p>上。無一不受高等敎育。故有産階級。可說都是智</p>
<p>識階級。我們中國。子女敎育。本不當一回事。有</p>
<p>資産很豐富的家庭。而他的家族。縱不目不識丁。</p>
<p>便是一智半解。　許因溺愛。而不使就學。也許因</p>
<p>晏安。而不肯讀書。景叔之子。觸目皆是。此外。</p>
<p>還有所受的敎育。還是閉關時代的遺物。充滿着拘</p>
<p>束於舊時思想下的陳舊智識。而不能吸收些新鮮空</p>
<p>氣。說他没受敎育呢。他倒之乎者也。偏會咬嚼字</p>
<p>。拿起筆來。儘可洋洋數千言。並非難事。即號稱</p>
<p>醫。而講玄學的。也是如此。其實思想落伍。毫没</p>
<p>世界觀念。現代常識。然而又不能不列他在智識階</p>
<p>級之間。有産階級之列。這類人物。徧地皆是。往</p>
<p>往鄭參亂樂。往往鄭參亂樂。最足敗事。孔子謂。</p>
<p>鄕愿。德之賊也。正深惡而痛絶之辭。我們對他們</p>
<p>。也當設法挽救一下。所以社會敎育宣傳工作。在</p>
<p>我們現社會情形之下。須分做兩部分。一部分是下</p>
<p>層工作。一部分是上層工作。至於方法一層。在當</p>
<p>局者。用得其宣。不必固執已見。且有時。也許要</p>
<p>隨機應變。使民衆易於印象入腦。不過宣傳上腦。</p>
<p>不過宣傳上最簡單的智識。至少須灌輸下列數點。</p>
<p>俾可使民衆認識標的</p>
<p>（一）癆病。不是遺傳病。是傳染病。（二）</p>
<p>癆病。可延染多人。足以傾家蕩産。（三）傳染的</p>
<p>路徑。是從吐出的痰。乾燥了。和灰塵飛散空中。</p>
<p>或重病人咳出的涎吐星。（泡沬）吸入肺中。但是</p>
<p>病人呼出的氣。不含病毒。（四）牛奶。最妥當。</p>
<p>煑滾了飲。（五）痰要吐在痰盂裏。不可隨也亂吐</p>
<p>。（六）要練就由鼻呼吸的習慣。尤其是在灰塵飛</p>
<p>散。和空氣不潔的區處。切不可開口呼吸。（七）</p>
<p>至少。每星期一二次洗澡。清潔身體。能習練冷水</p>
<p>擦身。以防感冒。更妙。（八）同居的。有肺病嫌</p>
<p>疑。切勿接近。（九）工廠，學校車站銀行·公司</p>
<p>·電局·及公共機關。並衆人會集之處。務須置備</p>
<p>痰盂。（十）掃地時。務必先洒水。尤須十分注意</p>
<p>小學校的值日生。</p>
<p>我們中國。因爲敎育尚未普及。所以學校敎育</p>
<p>。不過對於一部民衆的灌輸。而照現在社會民衆程</p>
<p>度。受舊敎育和未受敎育的還占大多數。惟有社會</p>
<p>敎育。可以補救一二。至於預防設施同題。有關國</p>
<p>家財政很大。目下究竟能有幾何力最。不敢妄言。</p>
<p>姑置不論。</p>

<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>華人納稅會豈能緘默？</p>
<p>誰也知道租界與華界不同，關於一切的公共事</p>
<p>業，租界當然要比華界好，這原因第一是因爲住居</p>
<p>於租界的人民所納的稅則高，第二是因爲外人辦事</p>
<p>的精神比中國人好。</p>
<p>但是我們仔細的觀察，所謂租界者也不可一概</p>
<p>而論，顯然地有着兩　不同的分野丨華人區域與西</p>
<p>人區域，因此而待遇也就不平等了！祇要從各方面</p>
<p>略爲觀察一下，就可以分别出誰是華人區域，誰是</p>
<p>西人區域。</p>
<p>現在祇提出衛生事業來講一購：所謂西人區域</p>
<p>，街道是靜靜的除掉一些「車水馬龍」之外，再没</p>
<p>有什麽閒雜的東西，馬路是終年的在修理着。清道</p>
<p>夫是終日的在清掃着，兩旁的樹木是整齊地排列着</p>
<p>，弄堂裏是永遠聽不到小販賣雜物的聲音，也永遠</p>
<p>聞不到一種污穢的氣味的。假使我們祇看了這樣區</p>
<p>域裏的情形，無疑地要稱頌租界當局一番的，但是</p>
<p>我們反過來看一看所謂華人區域又是怎樣呢？幾乎</p>
<p>是完全相反的！街道極端的嘈雜而污穢，亂石鋪的</p>
<p>馬路，異常的不便於行走，而且有些地方簡直是終</p>
<p>年不修理的。魚灘肉案一切一切的雜物是沿馬路的</p>
<p>擺着！最奇怪的，某馬路一個華人設立的慈善醫院</p>
<p>門首，排列着無數的菜灘，一種腥臭的氣味，使人</p>
<p>有掩鼻而過之勢，這固然要影響到醫院的衛生，而</p>
<p>且病人出入的時候，無形中也添着一層厭惡。華人</p>
<p>區域與西人區域的分别，那眞有天堂地獄之殊了！</p>
<p>同一租界，同一納稅，住居租界的人民，對於</p>
<p>租界當局是同負着一樣的金錢義務的，但是租界當</p>
<p>局的待遇却并不一樣，完全是不平等，即此衛生離</p>
<p>業一端，已足以概其餘了！</p>
<p>租界的當局們！人類是有同情心的，不平等的</p>
<p>待遇，究竟不是文明人所應有的啊！上述的種種，</p>
<p>假使平時没有注意及此，那麽要請你們特别注意的</p>
<p>。</p>
<p>末了！華人納稅會也不能辭其責的，該會爲全</p>
<p>租界華人的代表團體，對於華人所受的歧等待遇，</p>
<p>也永遠地緘默不言，這種「懼外」的心理，與「尸</p>
<p>位」的精神，不能不使我們懷疑的！</p>

<p>— 趙燔黃</p>
<p>夫人類在原始時代，其生活殆與猿猴相去無幾。日受風雨雷電之威迫，洪水猛獸之襲擊，災害傷病，受之旣慘。自然人運用其戇直之想像，以爲有神怪主使之。故發生巫醫卜卦，以治災禍。宗敎之起源，亦基於此。又自然人日與大自然爲伍，草木叢中營生，取謝圍草木果實而嘗之，當爲自然之趨向，其中美味可食者，遂成食品。苦味不快者，偶食之，或奏療疾之效，或遭毒殺之禍，於此辛苦備嘗之經騐中，遂有種種所謂民間藥者發見。現今重要之藥物，考其來歷，多有遠在原始民族，早已利用之者。即如今日局部麻醉劑之寵兒，所謂可卡因（Ｃocain）者，非來自南美土人所嗜好之古柯樹葉乎。止痛劑之阿片（Opium），乃爲古代亞剌伯民族所發覺。興奮劑之茶葉，早爲昔日中土人民所賞用。其他種種生藥，由民間藥蛻化而成者，不知凡幾也。</p>
<p>民間藥的實騐始祖，在東方民族開化史上，成光榮之一頁者，當首推吾國神農氏之嘗百草矣。考之西曆，恐尚距紀元前數千百餘年，遠在西方醫藥發軔之前也。惟古人推究醫藥，無其他學理科學器械之爲助，大率知其然而不知其所以然。即無非藉人類固有之本能，運用其靈敏之五官，感觸　境有用之材，加以嘗試而已。若追求其理論，則難免乎隂隂寒熱之推想，形色臭味之辦論，設　種虚無幽邈之假說，以附會之，不必與事實悉相符合，故卒難成其有系統之學說，此其所以異於後世之科學的醫學，必名實相符而後成立也。但古人憑事實而得經騐，則又决非絶無價值之可言。吾人正可由其豐富之經騐中，舍其僞而取其眞。以自然科學爲根據，玩索而得之，實騐而明之，以成其合理的解說。此則古代本草著錄，不論中外，所以在今日醫藥的發達史上，本草學的考據上，生藥學的研究上，同有參證討論之必要，而爲世界各國所重視，至今未能廢止者、良有以也。</p>
<h3 id="c243">生藥學與西洋之本草學 <a href="#c243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>今之所謂生藥，即古之所謂本草也，故欲明今日之生藥學，應先知古代之本草學。按西洋最初之本草，由低級之植物學啓發之。因植物學爲當時一種純正科學，僅求其能闡明眞理，不顧其他之目的也。西洋醫學之田來，非有希臘古代科學的精神，焉得羅馬時代諸先哲，知考求物質的利用厚生之道。當紀元後第一世紀時期，其中植物科校之智識豐䆳者，莫如戴司可利特氏（DioscorideCa6A·D·）主眼在植物之用途，創設植物之人爲分類，舉六百種之藥用植物而記述之。其學說不泥於純正植物學，誘導而成應用植物的本草學。戴司可利特氏植物學上之學術買獻，實不落齊物拉司氏（Theophrtst370-285B·C·）（希臘時代林娜氏以前植物學家）之後，當時已分植物爲香料·食料·藥料等，而示以植物利用之範園。從科學上言之，是脫離哲學與純正植物學，而創應用科學的本草學，人類所獲之利益，非淺尠也。戴司可利特氏本草學，博當時非常之聲譽。至文藝復興期止，於十四五世紀之間，嶄然有獨占之勢力焉。</p>
<p>所謂本草學者，不限於植物之一類，採集動植鑛等之材料，居自然科學（Historianaturalis）之地位，而利用於治療方面者，此東西洋之趨向相同。故本草之學，不問中外，至今均有存在之事實者也。又本草在過去史上，惟東西洋異者，西洋之本草學家、多從所謂Rhizotomi（採根家）之後，方産生一希波克拉底氏（Hippocrates460-377B·C·）之大醫藥家從亞里士多德（Aristotte384-322年殁）大哲人之門下，方造成一齊物拉司之大植物學家。（作植物史HistoriaPantarum記載500餘種植物）。此等學者，早奠科學之基礎，本草學詩代轉向植物學時代而遠渡，故醫藥進行之途徑，終有歸納。東方誕生一神農而傳神農本草經一書。雖歷代賢君名哲，皆本是書相因相革，刪補修訂。然僅囿於本草之一門，終不達純正科學之域。今試比較東西兩力之本草，則知西洋之本草學與植物學之進步，占並駕齊驅之勢。中國之本草學，單獨發達而已，因初無植物學等相輔而行，故終陷於故步自封之境，誠堪浩嘆。（待續）</p>

<p>（十六）黃連Coptis</p>
<p>本原太品係屬毛莨科，乃採掘其曾經七八年之根莖，去鬚根曬乾而用之者，種類甚多：有菊葉黃連（CoptisAnemonaefoliaS·etz·）芹葉黃連（CoptisBranchypetalaS·etz·）細葉黃連（CopotisBranchypetalaS·etz·VarPygmaca·Miq·）大葉黃連（CoptisOrientalis，Maxim·）等。</p>
<p>性狀本品普通皆彎曲，有多數細小之支根，頂部帶有殘餘之葉柄，外面現暗黃色，處處生有瘤狀物。折斷面尖銳粗糙·無臭·味極苦。咀嚼之，唾液染成黃色。</p>
<p>成分本品重要成分爲拜爾拜林，（BerberinC20H19Na5）然據近來之研究，除拜爾拜林外，尚有巴爾馬汀（PalmatinC20H21N05），及柯龍巴明（ColumbaminC21H19N05）之抽出。然因此兩成分，亦含於柯龍婆根（RadixColnmbo）中，故知黃連與柯龍婆根係相類似物。</p>
<p>效用本品爲苦味健胃藥。因其所含成分與柯龍婆相相似，故又可作柯龍婆根之代用品。</p>
<p>（附錄舊說）大苦大寒，入心，瀉火，鎭肝，凉血，丨一凡治血：防風爲上部之使，黃連爲中部之部之使，地榆爲下部之使。丨丨燥濕，開鬱，除煩，解渴，益肝膽，厚腸胃，消心瘀，治腸癖，瀉痢，痞滿，心痛，伏梁，酒毒，明目，定驚，除疳，殺蚘。</p>
<p>據李時珍說，黃連有二種：一種根粗無毛有珠，如鷹雞瓜，而堅實。色深黃。一種無珠多毛　中虚，黃色消淡。各有所宜。然今所用者，大抵不拘形　肥瘠，擇深黃色而實者其質輕虚。或帶黑色，係下品，不堪用。</p>
<p>（附註）黃連雖爲中藥，然現時中醫所用者，幾全爲日本黃連。不獨價廉，且質堅色黃。中華藥典所收載之黃連，雖植物註明中國黃連（CoptisChinensisFranch）然其性狀及組織，均根據日本丹波黃連條。其是否相同，中華藥典改正時，應加試騐證明之。本文亦多根據丹波黃連處，知過不改，歉甚！</p>

<p>— 王曉嵐</p>
<p>腦膜炎之症狀罹本病者，有定型及異型之别：定型症狀，繹病菌傳染後，濳伏數時，或一二日，或三四日，突然惡寒，戰慄，隨發高熱，達攝氏表三十九度以上，頭感劇痛，尤以後部爲甚·眩暈，嘔吐，煩悶不安，四肢痙攣，頸項强直；如病侵及脊髓膜時，脊柱·腰·背同或劇痛·病者不堪其苦，時發號泣，全身知覺銳敏，懼人按觸，强光高聲，均所忌憚·口唇顔面，常現匐行疹，軀幹·四肢亦間有起薔薇疹，或紅斑者。</p>
<p>因痙攣增强，遂致牙關緊閉，角弓反張，腹部陷没若船底，如將患者之膝，屈近腹部，則關節屈伸發生障礙；醫學上謂之凱耳黎（Ｋeinig）氏症狀，且皮膚血管之運動神經，異常興奮，稍受硬物摩擦，即久留紅痕；醫學上謂之脫魯梭氏（Ｔrousean）症狀·迨病至腦底，侵及視神經時，則瞳孔左右不同，反射減奶；侵及聽神經時，則覺重聲，耳鳴；若眼筋與顔面神經麻痺，則現歪顔斜視；若病達大腦皮質，更能發生偏癱，截癱，言語障礙，局部痙攣諸症象。</p>
<p>本病熱型無定，呼吸不調，每多關節腫痛，脾臟增大·意識混濁不清，譫語·嗜眠，甚至終日呈昏朦狀態·在乳嬰并有　門膨隆，吐乳等現象·當病初起時，脈搏緩徐，大小便不暢，腱與皮膚之反射，均見銳敏；迨至後期，因迷走神經始盛終衰，故脈搏頻數，痙攣轉呈麻痺，故兩便往往失禁，反射或減或消·重症瀕危時，體温屢見增高·最後多因腦麻痺·或心臟衰弱麻痺致死。</p>
<p>異型症狀：或僅覺頭痛，發熱·嘔吐·項强·數日即瘉·曰頓挫性腦膜炎；或操作如常，突發寒戰·暴熱·痙攣·昏倒，迅速致斃，曰電擊性腦膜炎·又有驟然失神·半身不遂，類似中風者，曰卒中性腦膜炎；更有病狀時輕時重，反覆發作，延及數週或數月者，曰間歇性腦膜炎，此外尤有於病中併發心臟内膜炎等症者，已載病理内，兹不復贅。</p>
<p>腦膜炎之經過及預後本病經過預後，多隨病狀而異·定型經過，通常約二三週·其獲治者，逾一二週後，病勢漸退，日就痊瘉·但瘉後常遺有頭痛·眩暈·斜視·盲目·耳聾·白痴·失語·步行障礙·腦水腫·筋肉强直·或身體一二部分麻痺等後患·其險惡者，每於第二週内，因腦症增强，或心臟麻痺，失其生命·異型症中，僅頓挫性者，能於數日内獲瘉；電擊性者，經過迅速，多難療；間歇性者，亦常因久病衰耗，或併發他症致死。</p>
<p>本病之死亡率，據歷來統計，每視流行程度，病狀輕重，及治療適否爲轉移·多者達百分之八十，少則爲百分之二十，平均約居半數以上，就中以幼兒乳嬰爲尤多·且罹病者，即使治瘉，往往遺留後患·在幼兒腦力受損，智識低劣，學業不無影響，其能完全恢復健康者，殊屬罕見。</p>
<p>腦膜炎之診斷當本病流行時，若發現有如前述之症狀者，不難診斷·但欲得確切之根據，須採取鼻咽腔分泌物，或腦脊髓液，行病菌培養；并於顯微鏡下染　檢查，覓得其固有之胞内腦膜炎雙球菌·惟本病之類似症甚多，兹　其異點分列於下，以資鑑别：</p>
<p>（一）癆菌性腦膜炎此症概田長期之前驅症狀，如頭痛·發熱·惡心·嘔吐等徐徐引起·常有癆病之遺傳體質，及皮膚·骨·淋巴腺·肺臟·眼底等處之癆病現象，可以證明，無口唇匐行疹·且脊髓液透明，含有癆菌。</p>
<p>（二）化膿性腦膜炎此症患者之體部，必先有耳下膜炎·化膿性耳炎·丹毒·骨瘍等膿窟存在·病中發現口唇匐行疹及關節炎者甚少·若檢查脊髓液中之病菌，亦屬不同。</p>
<p>（三）傷寒此症熱型特異，病勢緩徐，常發鼓腸等腹部症狀·無口唇匐行疹·如檢查維達爾（Ｗidal）氏凝集反應，或取脊髓液檢查病菌，自能明瞭。</p>
<p>（四）敗血膿毒症此症檢查血液，可以發見病菌·若檢查脊髓液，尤易判别。</p>
<p>（五）腦出血此症類似卒中性腦膜炎，但無項强·脊痛·發熱·知覺銳敏·口唇匐行疹等症狀。</p>
<p>（六）流行感冒此症常發强劇之上部氣道炎，如覺疑似，可檢查鼻咽腔分泌物中之病菌，東能明晰。</p>
<p>（七）肺炎此症呼吸頻促，且發特異之肺部症狀，并吐銹色痰，故易區别。</p>
<p>（八）急性粟粒癆此症脈搏呼吸急速，脊髓液中雜有癆菌，檢查脈絡膜，更可發見癆病結節。</p>
<p>腦膜炎之治療（一）看護法凡患本症者，須安靜身心，頭部用冰枕，或覆冷濕布，以緩解痛苦，脊柱亦然，口腔·咽頭時以消毒藥水，如雙養水·綠酸鉀水等含嗽，大便不通，則行灌腸。尿閉，則行橡皮管通尿法。病室中，光線宜淡，空氣宜潔，高聲强光等一切剌激，悉宜避免。對於飲食，應擇富營養易消化之流動品，如乳汁·葛粉·薄粥等爲佳。若病漸回復，可酌行温浴。筋肉衰弱者，可應用電氣療法，及按摩法。</p>
<p>（二）血清療法腦膜炎血清中含有免疫體，能滅菌除毒，功力甚偉。昔之死亡率十居七八者，近時應用血清，可減至十之二三。惟本病來勢甚驟，故使用愈早愈佳。其注射部位，宜在脊髓溝内，蓋可直接上達蜘蛛膜腔，較之注射皮下或股内者，效力確實。用量多寡，須視病狀及剌取脊髓液之量而定，通常約二○至四西西，幼弱者可按年齡體質酌減，苟症勢不退，體温仍高，隔日可繼續應用。若毒已入血，須兼行靜脈注射。續發關節炎時，更可注入關節腔内。（待續）</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3 id="c246">我也談金聖歎 <a href="#c246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— 陳子展</p>
<p>「文學」創刊號有魯迅先生的談金聖歎一文，金聖歎地下有靈，他也當首肯的。不過魯迅先生只看見金聖歎的壞處一面，其實，他的好處一面却也有不可埋滅的地方。就拿他對於小說的見解來說罷。他生在八股文，傳統的古文學方盛的時代，他抬高白話小說在文學上的地位，不以爲「那是文學中的一個旁支」。他敎他十歲的兒子讀水滸，他勸初學的人讀水滸，以爲水滸之文謹嚴，讀水滸即得讀一切書之法。他以爲水滸文章的碑神理，正如論語的一節兩節，瀏然以清，湛然以明，軒然以輕，濯然以新。又以爲水滸之文和莊子史記有同樣的謹嚴。可是他不曾敎初學的人讀論語　莊子一類的古書，這是何等見識，豈是僅僅「拾了袁宏進的唾餘」？豈不要呌今日的遺老遺少愧死？</p>
<p>至於他批評水滸西廂，乃至莊，騷，史記，杜詩，「都硬拖到八股的作法上」，誠如魯迅先生所說。不過我們要知道用八股的作法來量度别的文學，是從明朝中葉以來一般文人的共同習慣，這罪過不能通通記在金聖歎的賬上。李卓吾鍾伯敬諸人的評點小說那是不待說了，便是古文大家歸有光評點史記，以及唐荆川茅鹿門評點唐宋八大家文，又何嘗不是用的八股方法？</p>
<p>再有一點，金聖歎因爲痛恨流寇的緣故，除了評語裏面常常附會一點春秋律法以外，「截去水滸的後小半，夢想有一個稽叔夜來殺盡宋江們，也就昏庸得可以，」魯迅先生的評論極正確，我是没有什麽拙見參加的。至多我只能說是金聖歎爲了參加反抗貪官污吏的合法運動（即所謂哭廟案）而被殺，恰證明了即以某動的方式反抗不良政府的「流寇」，也未可厚非。</p>
<p>總之，金聖歎抬高了小說戲曲的文學價值，反抗文學上的傳統主義，算他和李漁是明清之際文壇上的兩大怪物。而且金聖歎究竟是因反抗貪官污吏而死，似乎也值得有志之士的同情。</p>

<p>提到名震林（悟岡），大概誰都會想到他的「西青散記」；可是我想說的，却是在「散記」以後刊印的不經見的「華陽散稿」「散記」是隨筆，而「散稿」則是文集。「散稿」的内容，主要的是記人，記事，記遊，論學；裏面收了他自已很多的詩。他論詩，也頗有獨到的地方，如在「舒秋堂詩序」裏所說，「以唐詩爲胡蘆，而依樣畫之者，鈍也；以宋詩爲羊棗，而囫圇吞之者蠢也。學唐詩者如畫虎，虎之意少，而狗之意多。學宋詩者如刻鵠，鵠之形假，而鶩之形眞」是很有見地的。他所記的人，當然有很多的異人，如「嗟翁」之類；記遊文，一樣的多新趣。全書兩卷，每卷末均有「小記」，上十七則，下七則，其優美者，不亞於散記諸稿。如下卷之「小記」七云：</p>
<p>乾隆乙酉仲春朔，景物晴美，菊臺詩弟子約遊平山。道過西隱禪房，訪程澄潭，不值。過蕃釐觀周彬如古道院，晤倪生紫雯，設蔬飯。壁間多字畫，嘆不與錄錄居士同來，叩玉勾洞天問瓊花消息也。拉倪生過虹橋，遠香拂面，梅五分未足，破顔迎笑，如欲索詩，復以不約江郎爲嘆。過法海寺不入，喚渡而西，望梅嶼野鶴，高步從容，隔花隱現。與菊臺明吟江郎驚人之句，復歎不與偕此賦詩，遂不到平山而返。别倪生，迂道晚候錄錄居士，命酒。辭歸，記以五古，索老友震亭及墨耕，琴莊，枳園，斟溪，于田，諒齋，兼寄西琴和之。江郎筆上花，先與紅梅競發矣！</p>
<p>不過，「小記」中佳作雖多，而特殊是瞑想的「小記」，但舍少數一二則外，我殊不愛讀。此中主要原因，是「小記」，也可以說，是「華陽散稿」全書，大都反映着此公晚年皈依佛法後的思想，所以全是因果的說法，其不涉及此點者，眞是很少很少。「散稿」不能如「散記」一樣流傳的原因，其故或許就在此吧。全書文筆遒健，用字頗多心力獨到處，如「記馬授疇」一文，震林叙其游踪，活用動詞，眞令人有變化無窮之感。</p>
<h3 id="c248">海濱小坐 <a href="#c248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— 林微音</p>
<p>不知怎麽，我心中在暗暗希冀會來一個什麽熟人，即使是一個往往遇見了只會淡淡地彼此招呼一下而不見得會談什麽話，即使極平常的應酬話，的熟人。可是茶是在一層一層地淡下去，熟人却依舊一個都没有來。雖然我不知道我自已怎麽會有了這樣的一個希冀、可是似乎因爲是有了一個希冀，我又不想離此而他去，而且我也没有想到什麽的别可去的地方。</p>
<p>非特茶是在一層一層地淡下去，而且我的食量也已飽滿得無可再飽滿了。可是熟人是依舊没有來。現在，雖然没有想到有什麽别的可去的地方，也似乎已到了不能不離此而他去的時間了。</p>
<p>可是一定要走，就有好幾個去處來向我的思念訴說它們的優異，而我從中選定了海濱。</p>
<p>出了車站，我沿江向海走着直走到江與海的交流處。江中幾乎距離相等地間隔停着一條一條的帆船，船中是一盞一盞的石油燈。月亮是只有一絲，彎彎的，彎得那樣匀整，那樣勾引，彷彿是在向什麽人的眉毛挑戰。</p>
<p>燈塔上的燈是在一明一暗着，而離那不遠，站着一個旅舍，似乎爲那燈塔上的燈的一明一暗所催眠，已陷於入睡的狀態中。</p>
<p>來回地徘徊了一兩次後，我想坐，我便走進了那旅舍。旅舍漸漸蘇醒了，最後在餐室中也發了光。</p>
<p>只想坐，我只要了一杯珈琲。</p>
<p>坐定了不久，走來了一條狗。彷彿同我很熟識似地，他蹲下在我的脚旁，在親密地向我望着。望了一回，他又站起來去走：走了一回，又蹲下在我的脚旁。不久，他睡着了，彷彿已得到了什麽安慰似地。</p>
<p>在那間比較地不好算小的屋子中，只有兩個生物，那條狗與我。狗是睡着了，而且似乎睡得很甜。醒着的呢，不知怎麽，心跳得很急。在那樣靜的塲合中，心會跳得那樣急，似乎是没有來由的。可是心就在這樣無來由地馳騁着。</p>
<p>也許就爲太靜了的緣故吧，心跳得那樣急？於是我想把狗弄醒。可是我没有眞地弄醒牠。我只向牠望着，親密地，彷彿牠是我的一個親密的伴侣似地。我不肯弄醒牠。我要讓牠睡，要睡得更甜我就那樣坐着，坐在那樣靜的屋子中，也並不再企圖探究出那心的跳得那樣急的來由來。</p>
<h3 id="c249">關於「現實的認識」 <a href="#c249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— 徐懋庸</p>
<p>相隔兩月之久，侍桁先生忽而記起有人曾經「指擴」過他的意見而指摘錯了，於是遥遥地追上來「反對」。這在寫那篇文章的我，是吃驚不小的事，同時又覺得很爲難。也來再說幾句麽？恐怕要被侍桁先生和第三者疑爲好辯或好勝。默爾而息罷，則實在頗覺得寃苦，自從「雜談小鬼」一文在自由談上發表以來，意外地招惹出來的是非已太多了！</p>
<p>說起來倒是一段小小的因緣。我對於中國的批評家的文藝批評，是向不留心的。但那一次之所以注意到侍桁先生批評沙寗的文章而且讀出一點感想來者，乃是聽了巴金先生的話所致。巴金先生曾對我說：「在文藝批評方面，韓侍桁是很有希望的，他發表的批評文字還不多，但他對於文藝的研究，實在很深」。是這幾句話的影響，使我注意侍桁先生的文章，而且很信任他。</p>
<p>當他批評沙寗，以爲沙寗這人「不是歷史上的典型」而「完全是藝術家的幻想的果實，即作者之理想的人物」時，我還是完全首肯的，但當他說沙寗的作者因藝術製作力薄弱，「以致形成非常誇大的非常做作的東西」時，我曾提出一點補充的意見。</p>
<p>我的意見很簡單，就是：（一）誇大和做作，爲無論怎樣的作家所難免。即便是屠格湼夫筆下的「歷史上的典型人物」，亦很有誇大和做作之點，（二）沙寗之所以不成其爲一個時代的典型，則根本是因爲社會的地並無這樣的人物的存在，（換言之，即這完全是藝術家的幻想的果實），與作者的藝術製作力無多大關係當時我本來還想說一說阿爾志跋綏夫的藝術力，以爲把他的藝術製作力說做薄弱，這標準未免定得過高，尤其是對現今的中國作家而言。比屠格湼夫稍覺遜色的人們，便算薄弱，侍桁先生的批評眞是苛酷啊！</p>
<p>然而那時我並不專和侍桁先生討論，所以這意思就不曾寫出。如今在這裏寫了出來者，乃是要使侍桁先生知道，輕輕地斷定阿爾志跋綏夫爲淺薄，我也是不能同意的。（未完）</p>

<p>— 莫泊桑著　李維克譯</p>
<p>她曾經欺騙他的父親嗎，她？……他的父親丨不錯，這是一個正直的，誠實的，對於事業不肯苟且的男子，可是他腦裏所想的從没有超出他的小店的範圍以外。這以前非常漂亮的女人丨丨這是他所知道，並且現在别人也還看得出來的丨丨天賦有一種優婉，慇懃，善感的靈魂的女人，怎會肯和一個與自已這樣不同的男子訂婚並結婚並結婚呢？</p>
<p>何必追究呢？她是和那些小女孩子憑着父母之命，嫁給享着奩資的男孩一樣出嫁了的。他們結婚後立刻便住在孟瑪特街的店舖裏；擔任着管賬的新婦，被那種新家庭的精神，那種流行在巴黎大部分商人夫婦間的，代替愛或甚至感情的對於共同利益的微妙且神聖的觀念所鼓舞，開始以她所有的活潑且緻密的智能，爲他們家庭的前途而工作。而她的生涯便這樣單調，平穩，誠實，没有温情地度過了！……</p>
<p>没有温情？…難道一個女人可以從不發生愛情嗎？一個年青的漂亮的女人，住在巴黎，念着書，賞讚着在舞臺上殉身於熱情的女　，她能够從少到老，使自已的心没有一回被打動嗎？這如果說的是另一個女人，他不會相信的丨爲什麽是他母親他便相信呢？</p>
<p>不錯，她是和别的女人一樣能够發生愛情的！因爲，雖是他的母親，爲什麽便會和别的女人不同呢？</p>
<p>她曾經年青過，那時她也有着一切擾亂青年男女的心的含有詩意的過失。被關閉，拘禁在店舖裡，和一個庸俗的，老是說着商務的丈夫相處的她，曾經夢想着月下，旅行，在夜隂裡的接吻等等。隨後，有一天，一個男子正像書裡面所描寫的情人一般在她的眼裏出現了，他並還像書裡面的情人一樣和她談了話。</p>
<p>她愛上了他。爲什麽不呢？這是他的母親呀！得啦！難道因爲是他母親的緣故，他便得變成愚盲，竟至把顯然的事都加以否認嗎？</p>
<p>她曾失身於他嗎？…自然啦，因爲這人不曾有過别的女友；自然啦，因爲他始終愛着那和他遠離且衰老的女人，丨自然啦，因爲他把他所有的財産留給了她的兒子，他倆的兒子！…於是筆爾站了起來，氣得渾身發抖，恨不得要殺死什麽人才好！他伸長手臂，攤開手掌，想要揮擊，打毁，搗碎，絞殺！誰呢？所有的人，他的父親，他的弟弟，死了的瑪賴沙，他的母親！</p>
<p>他連忙往家裡跑。他去幹什麽呢？</p>
<p>當他打從信號柱旁一座小塔前經過時，那汽笛的尖銳的呌聲突然從他面前發出。他驚駭到幾乎倒了下來，一直退到花崗石的欄干上。他坐在那上面，他再没有力氣走路了，他完全被這呌聲嚇壞了。</p>
<p>最先回答這呌聲的輪船，好像離得很近，正在開進口來的樣子，這時潮水已經漲高了。筆爾轉過身來瞧見那被霧蒙住了的輪船的紅眼睛。隨後，在碼頭上電燈的散光的陳射之下，兩個堤岸之間整出了一個大的黑影。在他背後，那守夜者，那退職的老船長以嘶嗄的聲音呌道：</p>
<p>「什麽船名？」</p>
<p>在霧裏面，那立在甲板上的領港人，也以嘶嗄的聲音回答道：</p>
<p>「聖律西」。</p>

<p>— 韋拔</p>
<p>誰說中國人無組織，咱們中國正有的是組織，多的是組織。黨國大事且不去說他。只說一般小百姓們，要有花樣玩，就非閙一個組織不可。</p>
<p>咱們現在已經是民主的國家了，故一切行事都須依照民主的辦法。民主國家，據說最重人權，於是開會集議乃成爲做事必要的手續。開會必先有會，集議必先找人，這是一定不易的道理。於是而有各種會社的組織。</p>
<p>謹按民權初步」，只要集合之人，便可凑成一會。故弄頭巷角什麽「社」，什麽「會」的招牌之多，乃過於「專治五淋白濁」的廣告。發宣言，煌煌乎：佩證章，神氣活現，於是而四萬萬人，人人有組織，個個是會員矣，豈不盛哉！</p>
<p>細分其類，則讀書時代有「學生會」；出外則有「同鄕會」；自吹自棒，則有「座談會」；祈禱和平，則有「金光明法會」。他如你要救國，可入「救國會」；想坐飛機，則入「航空會」。推而至於研究跳舞有會，節衣縮食有會，治喪有會，迎送要人有會，只要你肯留心，破工夫，上自國家大計，下則飲食小節，無事不可成會。規模雖有大小，組織原無二致。「闊」則洋樓三層，「狹」則灶披一間，俱可充作會議之塲，當聯歡之所。委員七個八個，會員十個念個，一例堂皇行事，多少滿不存乎！人說中國人如一盤散沙，我說中國人像一塊芝麻糖，蓋到處混混，無往而不得也。</p>
<p>論到會的内容，招牌雖是各色，宗旨却只有一個。一曰捧人，二曰自捧。捧人之道，或得津貼，以爲報銷，或想得津貼，以圖自効。仰他人鼻息，當自已議論，採旗呐喊，奔走門牆，這是一種。自捧之道則在於吹，上建議，發通電，名列委員，或充代表，慷慨發言，看風使舵，聞失地則表示憤慨，勗抵抗則願作「後盾」。總而言之，曰須要做到八面玲瓏，又要像煞有介事。倘大名常見於報章新聞欄中，則不紅而自紅。捧得得法，自然也會捧入「要人」之林去的，否則至少「聞人」是有份的。蓋今人之於會社，已如魚之與水，去此無所謂「活動」這裏又有一個公式，爲大衆所遵守，就是「與其做人轎夫，不若自已開車」的一句格言。因爲「公意」雖然好聽，「專制」畢竟受用，一會之中，委員雖有七八，行事却只一二人的事。後進者更難出風頭，惟做　龍套而已，故入他人之會，不如自已組會，此今日會社之所以多也歟？</p>
<h3 id="c252">「禍水」 <a href="#c252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— 十本</p>
<p>小老婆呈「蘭水」，這句　，在幾年　　　　未深，社會經騐尚幼稚的我，　有些懷疑，有些爲小老婆呌屈，以爲這是一句侮辱「小老婆」的口吻：那知這次給我的親戚的，因小老婆而暴發的不幸事件，證明了，方始恍然大悟，深信這句話的言之不謬了。</p>
<p>原來我的親戚李君，他是鄕鎭上的一個富户，不動産在到八千多畝良田，在窮鄕僻壞的Ｘ鎭上，要算首屈」指的大田主了。他家全年的經常收入，就完全挹注於田租上的啦。</p>
<p>先說明他的家庭組織，是一妻，二子，四女，和十幾個男女僕人，不算簡單，也不算複雜。</p>
<p>他雖年已知非，而夫婦倆的情感，倒還非常深厚，父子問也很融洽，上和下睦，家庭裏一片融樂氣象，人們異口同聲地稱羨着。雖則他自已和次子Ｘ官，患了烟癖，家庭裏有兩個銷金窟，但業大入豐，也正方興未艾哩。</p>
<p>不知怎的？今年春間，他忽然徒改常　、慾興勃發，醉心某烟窟裏的翁姓蕩婦，化千金納爲小星，卿卿我我，兩情繾綣，他夫人看了眼紅，不免有些酸性作用；時常去規諫他，那知他已被蕩婦灌足了迷湯，熱戀沸騰因之老羞成怒，立刻咆哮起來，將她丨大婦丨厲聲辱駡，又經蕩婦從旁慫恿，頓時怒火中燒，暴跳如雷，實行拳足交加，打得李太太目腫臉青，子女們上來相勸，也不分皂白，迎頭痛擊，母子們，受了辱，心有不甘，於是，不顧夫婦情感，父子倫理，而彼此一陣亂打，夫妻，父子，妻妾，扭做一團，各不相讓，凳几亂　，碟盞横飛，乒乒乓乓，哭駡喧天；一個融融樂樂的家庭，立時間變了一個自相殘殺的慘酷的戰塲！後來雖經四隣趕來勸解開了，但從此李君夫婦父子間，就起一條不可磨滅的敵對的裂痕！</p>
<p>這一次的家庭吵閙，是李君發生不幸事件的幕序。李夫人母子們，自那天受了虧之後，天天啼啼哭哭，暗暗計議，密圖報復。李夫人想出了一個武力對付的法子，重金運動大批流氓，到家來和小星爲難。那知流氓到來吵閙，那蕩婦有李君的袒護，也就不能損其毫膚，徒然損失了自已丈夫的名譽，把家庭弄得一個不成樣子！</p>
<p>李夫人的計策，雖未售，但他丈夫自此更加仇視她了！除終日辱駡外，還用嚴厲毒辣的手段，停止供給她母子們的飲食費用，於是李夫人更加悲痛了，覺得丈夫用這樣斷絶生活泉源的毒辣手段來壓迫，夫婦的情感，早已喪失盡凈了。那麽，還來顧全什麽大局呢？於是就於上月某夜，偷偷地收抬了細軟，携了子女，漏夜趕至邑城中，向司法控訴丈夫吸食鴉片，請求速予查拿，官廳對於李君的家富吸烟，早已眼紅了，現在李夫人去控訴，正是財星高照，求之不得的機會呢，立刻派了十二名法警，拿了　查公文，趕往李家。那時李君正在烟榻上，偎着愛人，笑逐顔開地慶幸大婦的出走，賽過拔去了一支眼中釘。</p>
<p>他和蕩婦被法警人證並獲，帶回法院，拘押囹圄。他於鐵窗中，得知了這事是自已的夫人所爲，心中非常地憤恨，但又一想，自已不應用毒辣的手段，停止她母子們的生活泉源，俗說：「他有情，我有義。」所以也難怪她用這毒計來報復哩！但是，他這時覺悟，懺悔，也已來不及了。</p>
<p>唉！爲了一個「小老婆」，他們夫婦的情感破裂，父子的倫理滅亡，把一個美滿的家庭，弄得四分五裂，不堪設想，可不痛心！那麽小老婆是「禍水」，眞非誣蔑之詞。</p>

<p>— 傳中</p>
<p>華！我眞要怨恨我爲什麽要跑到道大都市來讀書？這不但每年耗費了我的哥哥血汗的金錢，而且又累自已天天陷在苦痛的領域不是麽？要是我没有這點微末的知識，要是我在偏僻的鄕間和着曰出而作日入而息的兄弟伯督們過着田野間的生活，這不但我的身體不會弄得這樣衰弱，不但感不到什麽人生的苦痛</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>而且我該是怎樣幸福地過日子啊！</p>
<p>我時常嘆息着在呌「天哪！天哪」别人以爲我又在發瘋了，發瘋麽？是，我眞是發瘋了，因爲我對於這個人生之謎無所解答，我不解人生到底有什麽？忙個什麽？我天天忙着抄筆記，做練習，聽講，…其實我自不知爲什麽？這不過由於鈴聲的驅使，敎員難堪的面孔而已！我看馬路上天天整有不少人在着跑來跑去，車輛東奔西射，這一切又爲什麽呢？我找不出答案，我被這人生之謎煩擾了，我過着正如秋風敗葉般的生活，天天。</p>
<p>我們從呱呱墮地至老，至死，時間不過數十年，中國人人壽的調查，每人只不過二十多歲而已！那麽我不是將走近我的墳墓麽？我十多年前的人生，是浪費在學言語，學吃飯，學走路，學習俗，這年來又忙於學讀書，可是現在我又開始嘗人生的苦痛了，蟋蛄不知春秋，蜉蝣不知朝暮，人生，用那飛逝的光隂去比較，也正不是這一類的動産麽？</p>
<p>爲了繁殖我們底後代而生活麽？不，不是！我不是我的父母來的麽？但是我毫無意義的生着去轉爲傳種，這有什意思？爲生殖的話，該不是人生生存的答案吧！</p>
<p>詩人們說人生是水上的浮萍，聽着風吹波動，來自瞑瞑，去也空空，聽他自然便了，但這不是和草木同腐的人生麽！我是並不認爲是人生的答案。</p>
<p>我的母親說：「前世没有修行，所以有今世的苦痛；今世的苦痛，是再也無法避免的」，所以她天天吃素，唸經，任今生苦痛地生，爲來生得個安樂的日子，這樣，那麽人生「爲來世」的迷信談更渺茫不能令我相信。</p>
<p>「我們是青年，我們有滿腔的　血，我們有純潔的心腸，我們不游把人生　爲苦痛歷史，更不能毛呼地過生，我們該以善愛爲人生的目的，以改造不合理的社會爲畢生責任，使大家幸福，使人類平等自由」，有人這樣嚴厲地對我說，這答案確使我較爲滿意，我相信萬物之靈的人該有人的責任，斷不是同草木無爲地生無爲地死，但是，但是說愛麽？我却十二分地懷疑，後看「屍積如出」，「血流成河」，這是爲愛麽？一邊是「野有饖莩」，一邊是「朱門肉臭」，這也是爲愛人類麽？資本家的魚肉，勞動者的呻吟，這些都是愛麽？這社會裏我再也找不到什麽愛！到處只有勢利，奸刁險惡…的假面具。</p>
<p>華！我相信人生本可以享樂的，但因爲人類社會的不平把我們快樂的根基動摇了，人生也未可以相愛，但是少數喪心痛狂的人們爲了勢利把人類的愛絲割斷了，華！我們還任此生苦痛地死，也還是奮門地爲人類而生呢？</p>

<h3 id="c254">割稻 <a href="#c254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— 一琴</p>
<p>太陽晒在田裏的稻榖上，映成一片金黃色。微風裏已帶來了初冬的寒意。村莊上的人都在田裏割稻，這正是深秋的時候，鄕村這最富有的時候。</p>
<p>長生彎着腰在田裏工作了一整天，已感到有點疲乏，站起身來，擲下了鐮刀，深深的舒了一日氣。眼看着將没的太陽，自語道：</p>
<p>「十月裏的天氣，眞容易過：才盼到太陽出來，轉眼又下山了。一天只割得這一些些。」</p>
<p>「長叔，你今天割了多少？」鄰田裏的小狗過來問。</p>
<p>「從天才亮下田，一直到現在，還祗割得一畝田！你吧？」</p>
<p>「二畝差一點。」小狗答。</p>
<p>「不行了，我在二十年前，丨像你們那樣年紀時，一天曾割得三畝三，現在老了，可不行了！」長生無限感慨地說。</p>
<p>「唔……」小狗還報他一個同情。「就是年世也不比從前了。從前米糶六七塊錢一石，事物也没有現在這樣的貴。現在事産貴了，答倒反賤下去，眞是呌家人不要活下去了！」長生說着有點興奮。</p>
<p>「可不是，今年的米價，聽說又比往年賤。昨天前村阿虎上城去糶，上好的米，才得五元四角到手。况且今年的收成又不好。」小狗同情着說。</p>
<p>「照一般說起來，今年年成還算是好的。最好的有做到三石呢，只是一窮苦的人家，因借不到錢買肥料，店家又不肯賒欠，以致少下了肥料，弄得稻桿枯槁，那才是活受的損失。」</p>
<p>「這也莫怪，這年頭，誰能保得住，我們明天不逃走，有心借錢放賬給我</p>
<p>們呢！」</p>
<p>「可是田主是不應該的，他要收租米，他應該借些錢給我們做本。」</p>
<p>「田主，他又那裏知道田裏的事！他們只知向佃户們收租米，要錢，拿去抽大烟，打麻將，給姨太太花。他們又幾曾認得那一塊田是他家的，只不過是識得幾個字，憑那契單上說說罷了！除了那一張紙頭，他又有什滬憑據說這塊田是他家的？」</p>
<p>「那自然丨論到田裏的事情，城裏人又那裏趕得上我們鄕下人？就像我頭鑽泥裏近三十年，眞可以說得閉了眼睛也可以摸得出那田是好是壞來。只的二三十年來，除家裏添了幾個吃口之外，一個錢也没有多起，反空了許多債。」</p>
<p>「年世眞是愈過愈壞了，前幾年倒還好的，現在我們村莊上又有那一家不借債呢？丨我借處債，倒還可勉强挨過，但像今年連借都没處借，那才該死！」</p>
<p>「不借債又怎麽過活？就算是二石的收成，一石還了租，剩下一石還各種舊欠還不夠，又拿什麽過活呢？」</p>
<p>「長叔，眞呌我們拿什麽過活呢，丨我們總得想個辦法才好！」</p>
<p>「那又有什麽辦法，須看你們年青</p>

<p>— 敬嘉</p>
<p>自從有了一百五十塊錢一月之後，卞漸漸地厭棄他底妻英了。他對任何親友說：「她不配做我底妻了！這付醜相」</p>
<p>！」於是他把英和一個五歲的孩子丢在鄕下，另外混着一個女人。</p>
<p>說句老實話，英並不醜。當她在娘家過着黃金色的少女生活的時候，有不少的人追求着她。媒人常在她家裏出入着。卞也是追求著她的一個。當時愛着她的還有一個姓陳的。論門户，那姓陳的和卞是不相上下的：論品貌，卞實在比不上那個姓陳的。然而，爲了家庭，爲了環境，勝利終於屬於卞所有了。</p>
<p>我們不難想像到卞那時的喜歡和滿足的情形。當我們得到了我們所願望的東西時是何等的快樂啊！當然，在那時的卞比得到了五十萬的頭奬更爲快樂的。</p>
<p>然而，在「彼一時此一時」的口號之下，卞是遺棄了她了。當然，在不同的環境下是會有不同的慾生的。從前認爲最美的現在也認爲最醜的了。人的心是那樣的不可測摸啊！不是嗎？當卞追求英的時候曾經說過：「我要是没有她，我寗可死。」然而現在他却說：「要是我再和她做夫妻，我不是人養的。」</p>
<p>英有什麽辦法呢？她只能怪自已的命不好。她只能緊緊地抱着那天眞的孩子，把痛苦的涙珠滴在他的臉上。她把她將殘的青春一點一點地消靡掉，在痛苦裏，在寂寞裏。</p>
<p>雖然英的親友爲她不平，但是又有什麽用呢？卞曾經說過：「夫妻之事要絶對的自主，别人無權干預。」雖然英的親友們知道所謂：「絶對自主」的滑稽和矛盾，但是他們都不過是背鋤頭爲人流血汗的農夫而已！對於一個穿洋服掛徵章的官老爺，他們敢怎樣呢？</p>
<p>據說，卞在外面又娶了女人，並且有了兒子了。英的破碎了的心永没有回原的希望。結果她是瘋了！她哭着喊着，披着頭髮從這個村莊跑到那個村莊，又從那個村莊跑到另一村莊。黑暗的世界上又多了一個苦痛的瘋人了。</p>

<p>— 張老三</p>
<p>（七）姐姐的靈魂</p>
<p>除了在天的父母，數百里外的可愛的弟弟，我還有同情的敵人，新的開始，没有給我失望，英麗的前程，閃耀着一線光明。我重獲了我的敏姊愛我的敏姊。</p>
<p>十歲時候吧，元宵佳節，父親賈來三個走馬燈，天還没有黑，點上臘獨，姊弟爾個，到處亂跑，弟弟剛會學步，腰裏縛了腰帶，乳母楊媽扶着他，一手提了走馬燈，想跨大步和我們一樣亂跑亂跳。不留神，額角碰着牆壁，弟弟大哭起來；爸媽本來是最痛小弟弟的，知道是我們兩個禍種頭，二個走馬燈被搜去懸在牆壁上不許再玩。敏姊偷偷地拖了我的手說：「大街上有龍燈，魚燈，許許多多的燈，比這兩個走馬燈好玩，我們去看，不要給媽知道」。</p>
<p>我們偷出了門口，滿街上都是人，提着各式各樣的燈，歡躍，狂笑，我們在一家熟識的店門前站定，遠遠地擁來一簇人，混雜的聲音喊着看龍燈看龍燈，人羣像潮比一樣湧來，我們不及避讓，姊弟兩個被捲散了。我一邊湧着走，一邊高聲喊敏姊，這時候誰都没有注意到一個走失姐姐的孩子哭着喊着，我被擠倒在路旁，有一個熟識的人將我帶到家裏…</p>
<p>我受爸爸媽媽一頓重的責打，從此我失去了愛我的敏姊，現在姐姐的靈魂已降臨在頑皮孩子的身上。「我是敏姊」，這有力的細小聲音，給了我更大的勇氣。</p>
<p>我注視着敏姊的臉，敏姊注視着我，房内維持互相領悟的歡悅，兩個異鄕人的心中，激蕩起勝利的凱旋。</p>
<p>（八）春天的上海</p>
<p>從餐室步行着歸來，上海充滿了活躍的空氣，每一個微笑的影子閃耀在霓虹燈的光輝裏。南京路上的窗飾，誘惑行路人的注視，「夢中情人」多情的從無線電中播送出來，黃包夫也放開輕鬱的脚步，拉着他們的主顧到目的地去，在上海，似乎不見一張愁苦的臉。我們跳躍着返旅館。</p>
<p>靠上洋台，遥望迷茫中的故鄕，我記起我可愛的弟弟。</p>
<p>「敏姊，我們到上海來吃苦，不是享樂，住着這樣高貴的旅館，離我們到上海來的宗旨太遠，我們的先决問題丨一所幽靜的寓所，亭子樓也不妨，我們須從底下層做起！」</p>
<p>「弟弟，恕我騙你到這樣的旅館來。我有朋友，是幼稚園的校長，不久以前，她寫信來要我分她一點職務，讓我先去恢復我的音心，整理我的靈魂。你，先見你的舅舅，多少他能帮助你，你别以爲資本家都没有同情。從昨天起這神經惝恍，在火車上你不是没有睡覺嗎，喃喃地自語，我眞怕你要自殺啦，睡罷，本天的上海，晚上還是斜寒襲人」。</p>
<p>「敏姊，我辜負了你的好意，恕我，駡你無靈魂的女人」。</p>
<p>關上了長窗，我脫衣睡穩了，敏姊纔退身出去。疲乏確是疲乏，但被某一種莫明其妙興奮的東西剌激着整個的身體，用數一二三四的催眠法，數目儘自增加，兩眼呆望着帳頂没有睡意。　亂的思潮，更像電影似的閃映：畢業後的朋友都失散了，一個人被遣棄了地歸到故鄕，故鄕對於我並没有可戀的所在，兩位老人家的墳墓，橋下的流水，可愛的弟弟之外，我不願再提及任何一個人及任何東西。現在明知我已投身進了另一個世界，但是一切我不願提及的人物，徧在帳門的四圍不肯離去。重行披衣起身，燃上一枝捲烟，那是敏姊遺留在這裏的，一時我又想到這令人惝惚的女子，從她的叙述裏，她是我母親的寄女無疑，好像比親也對我說過敏妹回來了的話，不過我好像始終没有見過　，而她反這般注意我的行動，…我深深地吸了一口烟，開了長窗。</p>

<h3 id="c259">南洋巴里風景人物的一斑 <a href="#c259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— 西復</p>
<p>美國的黃金提高了當地的生活　弄得别國人起了望洋興歎之感</p>
<p>我記得前幾年有一個奥國的油糧家到了上海，他因爲朋友的介紹，讀我到他的寓所褒看他在南海一個巴里（Ｂali）島上的作品。我是早已聽見過巴里這個島，它在我的腦筋裏，如同夏威夷一樣具有使我「心嚮往之」的吸力。因爲那處山水幽美，人物秀麗，老實說，尤其是那種「本天眞而不着上衣的女子。可是那位美術家况給了我一個更深刻的了解，他的作品竟没有一張裸體的女子，而竟是一個一個端莊無比的女子正面面容。我在他的作品中，認爲巴里女子面貌之美，是世界各國女子所不及的，不能拿搽些香粉，點些臙脂的摩登女子去比擬的。拿塗脂抹粉的女子，和巴里的天然秀色相比，猶之以泥塑木雕的偶像，比之於團城玉佛的莊嚴妙相也。</p>
<p>但是這和電影有什麽關係呢？我的感想是由於一個消息而起的。我聽到好萊塢已經派人到巴里拍了一張完全當地風光的影片。我欣喜我們將來有在銀幕上看到巴里人物風景的希望，但是我國爲不願意作事先的過份宣傳，所以片名等等，暫時不提了。</p>
<p>大家恐怕都知道南洋羣島的名字，在英文上那個地方呌　南海（ＳouthSeas）。那地雄中國並不遠。那里最大的一個島呌做婆羅洲，那是英國的屬地。再望南就是爪哇，巴里等地，統通是荷屬東印度的地方。我們中國人在那裡經商貿易的極多，很操縱商業上一大部份的勢力。但是那裡，尤其係巴里，因爲白人知道的很少，所以除掉土人和中國人之外，白人去游歷的很少。聽說在五年前，歐美人士到巴里去游歷的，平均每季不過七十人。可是　了現在，每季歐美人士前往游歷的，竟增加到一千五百人之多，於是荷蘭政府竟在游歷事業上面，大大的發了一筆財。</p>
<p>我們都知道荷蘭國的政府，是靠殖民地發財的，這點對於巴里尤其眞確。巴里這個島，係由荷蘭政府將那裡的專利權賣給一個公司的，而荷蘭國的王后就是那個公司的大股東之一。自從美國人發見了那地方的風景人物之後，他們都拿它當作神仙樂土，都上那裡去游歷，尤其是好萊塢的明星們。自從美國人拿他們的黃金，在那裡誇耀過之後，那裏的生活標凖，就和那里的熱度一樣高升到了極頂。恐怕英法的富人，還可以到那里賞鑒賞鑒不穿上衣的少女。别國的人，恐怕就有望塵莫及之歎。聽說荷蘭人自已都不肯去的，因爲物價太高了。</p>
<p>好萊塢的明星們，到那裡去游歷的眞不少。其中頂有名的是却利卓别靈范朋克等等。　有一個笑話，就是却利卓别靈和他的兄弟雪特到了那裡，當地的荷蘭政府，不知爲什麽緣故，竟拿他當作兩位皇帝降臨看待，天天請他們游玩，吃飯，弄得他們啼笑不得，弄出胃病出來。後來幸虧一位老朋友把他們救了出來，藏在島邊的一個荒僻地方，繼拿胃病養好。而現在在巴里游玩的有格蘿利亞史璜和她的丈夫享利，以及康絲登斯義納脫等人。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c260">評「香草美人」 <a href="#c260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>丨明星出品丨新光開映丨</p>
<p>首先我們得承認作者採取現實的題材，而正確的把握和分析，的確是難能可貴的。</p>
<p>農村破産，鄕間的男女不斷的擠到都市擠入工廠，這是必然的現象。但是所謂民族資本終於敵不過外國資本的侵略，在竭盡棉力的競爭之下，到底失敗了。同時，民族資本雖然屈服於外國的經濟或政治的淫威之卜，另一方面却從工人身上盡量的壓迫榨取。因此，工人們飢餓，痛苦，工廠關門之後，社會上的失業者日益增加。這時候，覺悟者爲生活掙扎，奮門。反之，「純良忠厚」的工人們！安分守已的結果，使他們在極度磨折之後，亦認識了自身的出路。</p>
<p>全般的說，我們很同意劇作者的說法，不過其中對於民族資本的愛憐，與其後來又寫到工人生活因被剥削而處於死境，未免顯示作者情感上的矛盾。我們在作品中，固然應當寫出民族資本必然的没落，然而過於同惰却减弱了觀衆的情感，這不能不是一種損失吧？據說這一影片的劇本是一個復旦大學學生編製的，這是更加感覺興趣。的確，中國電影已經廣泛的被一般人所注意了，而且有着這種新的傾向和良好的成績，更證明中國電影前途的偉大。</p>
<p>在演出方面，導演陳鏗然君以現在和回憶相互的運用，在中國總算是一種新的方法。不過我們覺得過於用多了，却使人嫌其片斷的而破壞了情調上的統一性，有如流水賬似的。譬如說王阿大在法庭上說，「這樣又過了三年」，或是「有一天晚上，」馬上再以畫說明，這對於演出未管不是一種方便的方法，然而假使很有組織的將畫面嚴密的編織起來，也不是没有可能，而且觀衆的情感更因之緊凑而統一。我們以爲開頭的法庭，由巡捕口中變爲畫面，直至阿大說「我是一個木匠……」爲止，立刻完全以畫面叙述到底，最後再在法庭上終止這一回憶，似乎比較的很好。何况一段往事，又一段法庭，到底使人厭煩。而且總說明的字幕也覺過多。</p>
<p>除此以外，我們得承認導演者是相當運用了新的方法的。對於夏佩珍所飾的王阿大的女兒之性格的描畫，用香水，新旗袍，學抽香煙等等，以說明她以後大胆的出賣肉體，對於王微信所飾的阿大之兄弟，以工作時吃茶的敢怒而不敢言，而說明他反抗的個性，對於謝雲卿所飾的阿大，更是唯愼唯謹的而使他代表封建錢餘時代的典型人物。以及其他幾個演員的選擇，如阿大的老婆之純粹的賢妻，（其偕女兒出走，却有點奇突。）那個孩子的營養不良，都是很好的。</p>
<p>還有應該指出的，如窗外的夜景，自黑夜至天明，由於女兒的香煙而發現女兒帶了男人到家，在工塲中騷動的場面，巡捕捉阿大和其兄弟的場面，燒乳糕，阿大逗孩兒等等，都是很好的。特别是關於王阿大一家的描寫，都充滿了眞正的中國人的生活習慣。還有金元打倒中國煙囱的「卡通」，也是好的。</p>
<p>然而也有好些小的缺點：寫阿大之妻出走，前面没有相當伏線的描寫，以致奇突。在遊戲場中的許多鏡頭，佔了時間太多。阿大抱孩子到醫院去的一段路景，大可省掉，然而回來的路景却有意義了。同時悲劇的情感也嫌不夠，這應當是前面所說的法庭場面的破壞，因爲不能集中感覺的原故。</p>
<p>現在再要說到演員了。謝雲卿的成績，簡直使人驚奇。在「鐵板紅涙錄」中那樣失敗，而在這裏印是如此成功。他對於劇中人的感情，個性，眞是太有把握了。這一影片能有如此成績，他照當第一居功。夏佩珍從樓上下來慢慢的扣着衣領，非常自然，可是較之已往却未見進步。特别是她的頭部化裝，更覺不宜。王微信比較以前演得好多了。自「鐵板紅涙錄」中他開始飾反抗的角色以後，這裏確表現出他的成績。最好的自然是吃茶的那一個鏡頭。</p>
<p>攝影雖不見精采，也還可以，這在大公司中是不足　奇的。佈景犯了和以前同樣的毛痢，如法庭和置院等，弄得那末現代化，總使人感覺太隔閡，爲什麽要在佈景上來努力於劇情没有必要的誇張呢？希望明星公司的裝置家特别注意。</p>
<h3 id="c261">評「健美的女性」 <a href="#c261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— 李馥</p>
<p>據寡聞的筆者的記憶，這是在一海開映的第一張没有故事的「純文化電影。」丨丨幾年前在北四川路日本演藝館開映而被當時的上海人哄傳做模特兒影片的「産婦衛生影片」，雖然可以說是文化電影的一種，但是純客觀的「記錄電影」與具備着積極的敎育意義的「文化電影」之間，是有相當距離的差别的。</p>
<p>雖則在報紙上，不曾指出這是那一國的出品，但是，祇要稍稍留心一點世界文化電影情形的人們，誰都知道這是一張蘇聯梅奇拉姆社的作品。丨丨一張蘇聯影片上映的時候，竟用「意大利墨索里尼，德國希德拉奬勵」等字樣來作宣傳，這不能不令人感到異樣的滑稽。其實在德國，包含着文化電影在内的一切蘇聯電影，早已被希德拉政府禁止的了。</p>
<p>這片子是在一定的目的意識之下，用記錄電影的方法，加上很多巧妙的圖解線盡而編攝的作品，爲着調劑觀衆興味，中間還夾寫了幾段顯明的對比，譬如蒙古民族在分娩時的那種懷無人進，而又使人發噱的習慣，在這兒拿來和蘇聯政府經營的勞働婦人産院的一切設備比擬一下，這不僅很有效的達到敎育的目的，而且，對於那種能使一切女性那般舒適而又安心地逐行母性天職的社會組織，發生一種深刻的反省。</p>
<p>我們看到了工場女工的衛生設備。在工作幾小時之後，女工們很愉快地打開了一切窗户，脫去了工作衣服，整齊地舉行五分鐘的柔軟</p>
<p>幾乎使我懷疑，以爲這是和「小玩意」裡面的黎莉莉敎貧苦兒童們學體操一樣的是一種作者的空想；在我　後的一位觀客就在悄悄地說：「這是實際上叢不到的事情」。不錯，在中國或歐美日本，這確是做不到的，可是在這片子上所表示的，原是在另一　社會秩序下的蘇聯。曾有這樣的一句名言：「電影在愚昧的欺許者手裡的時候，非特不能使觀衆得到好處，而且要對他們散播着有害的種子，可是當觀衆自已獲得了電影的時候，當電影被把握在新文化的眞實的活動者的掌中的時候，它就變成大衆敎育的一種最有力的工具。」「健美的女性」，證實了這句話的正確，這片子可以使觀衆得到很多的好處，不論在智識上，在認識上。</p>
<p>這片子和那些爲着營利而製作使觀衆發生不良的作品，比較一下，我想聰明的觀衆，一定能夠得到一個明　的答案吧。</p>
<h3 id="c262">我們的金燄　原來如此！ <a href="#c262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— 鶴</p>
<p>說也奇怪，在霞飛路上我遇着了金燄了。爲什麽奇怪呢？這是没有理由的。在我，總算是奇遇。我們不是長久不見面了麽。現在又遇着了。</p>
<p>只見他穿了一件紅色羊毛上衣，打哥爾夫球穿的西裝褲頭上是小學生戴的帽子。不大健康的臉色，十足的黃種典型。我們拉了一次手。我說：</p>
<p>「我看了報上你登的啟事，到底是怎麽事呀？」</p>
<p>「這個嗎，說起來眞是笑話，有人把我看成某黨某派的要人了，這簡直太誇大我了。事實上小子無知，一無所長，慚愧得很，只能在銀幕上給女人們開開心。所以登一個啟事，說幾句老實話。」</p>
<p>「嗄，這眞是太……太……太什麽了（一個人詞不達意總是很苦的。）可是什麽有人疑到你的頭上來呢？」</p>
<p>「這大概是因爲在南國社演過卡門的原因」又是他說：「可是這也是非常簡單的事。田漢敎萬籟天來找我帮忙演戲，我爲了自已歡喜便來了一次。其實我和田漢根本就没有什麽交情，他家裏我也不知道在什麽地方。」</p>
<p>「唔，這才滑稽了。……」我再問。「那末你演「母性之光」，「三個摩登女性」那種片子，也是容易給人悮會的囉。」</p>
<p>「老兄，這也是没有辦法的事。老實說，我到底是一演員，我和公司裡訂了合同，公司要我演那一個角色，我能夠不答應嗎？他們要我做賣國的奸臣，我也不得不幹啊。」</p>
<p>「不說了罷，這些事情。……你近來的生活怎樣」</p>
<p>「我的生活嗎，總算是滿有味的。我星期三和星期六學聲樂。此外打球，翻槓子，發粉盡，看電影，還歡喜打獵。說到這裡我又要說了。一個電影演員，他的面孔一定是大家認識的，我到那裡也没有方法秘密，像我這樣的人，還配秘密活動？」</p>
<p>「哦！原來如此。」</p>
<p>一輛汽車駛來，將我們左右分開，就此我向他揚揚手，說：</p>
<p>「你去你的罷，我得回去了。」</p>

<p>— 謝月笙</p>
<p>「姐姐，他是剛打城裏來的·」紅玉連忙凑上去替天雄辯答，一面向他哥哥丢了一個眼色，故意把那件坎肩給雪芳看。「姐姐：你看這是他剛從城裏買來的。」她很公平地替她哥哥解釋。雪芳感覺自已說話太冒失，頓時臉上起了一陣紅暈。天雄也怕她誤會，就把城裏聽得的新聞講給她倆聽。他告訴雪芳，明天西湖邊將要舉行一個美術展覽大會，約會她明日一同去參觀。雪芳很爽直的答應了。</p>
<p>第二天的早晨，雪芳偕着天雄紅玉，在展覽會裏，參觀那位藝術家蘇容的作品。蘇容親自招待。他是個年少有爲的藝術家。風度瀟洒，談吐温和，在愛美心理高漲的雪芳，經過了這次的認識，使她内心的深處，糾起一度劇烈的叛變。她告訴他住址，說她家裏祇有一個老母同一個弱妺。以一個客鄕孤獨的蘇容，偶然地得到了這個意外的奇遇，當然很高興的接受了。「蘇先生有空請到舍間去，再會吧！」雪芳天雄紅玉向蘇容道别了，蘇容親自送了他們出來。</p>
<p>「梅小姐也在這裏嗎？」這陣聲音把雪芳衆人楞住了。於是大家把視線注意到這個人身上去，只見那人大摇大擺地走了過來。雪芳認得他是當地很有財勢的紳士曹懷仁，但她厭惡他那種驕慢無禮的舉動，勉强地招呼了他一聲，逕自去了。曹懷仁恃着金錢萬能，就實行他的追求工作。過工幾天？曹懷仁特地買了許多禮物，去謁訪梅雪芳。</p>
<p>「她有病醫生說不能見客，」曹懷仁竟遭擋駕了。但他並不懷疑她，祇是很掃興地出來了。這不是那天展覽會裏的少年美術家蘇容嗎嗎？曹懷仁看見了蘇容走進梅家去，頓時會悟到自已當時被擋駕的情形來。他决定進去探明個眞相。</p>
<p>一嘔，你就是蘇先生嗎？請坐！小女在裏頭哪。」懷仁聽見這個說話人的聲音，正是剛才和自已說話的那個中年婦人。於是他的呼吸也短促了，手足也發頗了。他知道那個少年美術家無疑地是自已的情敵了。他不忍再聽下去，就悄悄地退了出來。在外面換吸了一口氣，懊喪地走了。恰巧紅玉和天雄同來訪雪芳，她看見曹懷仁從裡面出來，忙着向天雄說：「哥哥：你看那人怎麽也來看梅小姐呢？」</p>
<p>一我看他不像好人，梅小姐怎麽也和他往來哪？」他倆同樣地怎樣想，一面已走　梅家去了。（未完）</p>

The original telegram is as follows: (Omissions) Your Excellency leads a mighty army to encircle and suppress the communist bandits. The great scourge in the heartland is gradually being pacified. The whole country is grateful and yearns for governance. The turning point for national prosperity is here. However, at this time of national crisis, when the nation is on the verge of destruction, rebellious party members Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, Cai Tingkai, and others dare to raise the banner of rebellion, openly betray the party and the country, sell out the nation, sell supplies to the bandits, and collude with enemy countries. The bad news has spread, and all Chinese are ashamed. Such rebels must be severely apprehended, or where will party discipline and national law exist? We comrades are deeply saddened and are determined to wait for orders and serve as vanguards, vowing to slaughter the great criminals and calm the public's anger.

What is even more painful is that the aircraft and war equipment that overseas Chinese purchased with blood and sweat and donated to the army during the Battle of Shanghai were originally hoped to be able to thoroughly resist Japan and be used to defend the country, but now they are being used by rebels to harm the nation. Alas, how painful! The country is precarious and cannot withstand further chaos. Our association leads overseas Chinese at home and abroad to engage in the national rejuvenation movement and to implement the principles of domestic pacification and foreign resistance. All rebels are considered enemies. In addition to summoning comrades and telegraphing Chairman Chiang to be prepared for battle, we especially express our sincerity and earnestly hope that all patriotic overseas Chinese will unanimously denounce them, understanding that with the country in danger, we have an inescapable responsibility to ensure that this motley crew of ugly creatures is wiped out completely in the shortest possible time, so that the nation may have a chance to rise and our suffering may be relieved.

<p>(Guangzhou) Hu Hanmin, Xiao Focheng, and others sent a telegram to Chen, Li, and others in Fujian Province on the 24th, saying: Chen Zhenru, Li Renchao, Jiang Jingran, Cai Xianchu brothers, greetings, your telegram has been received. (Omission) News has spread that you brothers held a meeting in Fujian and declared your secession from the Chinese Kuomintang, abolition of the Blue Sky White Sun flag, approached Japan externally, colluded with the communists internally, and issued a political program openly calling for the overthrow of party rule and the organization of a government of peasants and workers. Initially, it was thought that with the brothers' past history in the party, they would not regress to such an extent. However, newspaper reports clearly indicate that the news is true. This is not only providing an excuse for those who rebel against the party and sell the country, but also causing the brothers' past history of resisting Japan, suppressing communists, protecting the party, and saving the country to be completely erased. Moreover, it is betraying principles, inviting external invasion, and fanning the flames of communism, causing endless harm. How can such absurd actions gain sympathy at home and abroad? Standing from the position of the Three Principles of the People, not to mention that we cannot condone them, we deeply regret that the brothers have completely abandoned what they have upheld. (Omission) The entire corps of officers of the 19th Route Army have long shared hardships with us brothers. Over the years, they have been inspired by the teachings of the Three Principles of the People and have fought for the party, risking their lives. Their great achievements are admired both at home and abroad. They should still have a deep understanding of justice and not abandon themselves, associating with the communist party and plunging themselves into a dead end. We sincerely hope that the brothers will uphold the spirit of protecting the party and saving the country as in the past, change course, and persuade them in various ways to avoid entering the wrong path, so that the unity of the Southwest can be consolidated and the great cause of saving the country can be promoted. Otherwise, giving others an opportunity will inevitably cause pain to those close and joy to those who hate. Saving the country but harming the country, loving the people but harming the people, we believe that this is definitely not the brothers' original intention. Brothers, for the sake of the party and the country, we must implement our principles and work together. We only hope that the brothers will consider this. We cannot express the urgency of waiting for orders in this telegram. Hu Hanmin, Xiao Focheng, Deng Zeru, Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, Zou Lu. (26th Dispatch)</p>

The garrison army will still be stationed as before in accordance with the Boxer Protocol. The takeover of Yuguan is scheduled to begin in early or mid-December.

<p>(Nanjing) Liu Wenlong and Sheng Shicai telegraphed Beijing on the 25th, stating that Ma Zhongying secretly sent his deputy division commander Ma Heying to Ashan to coerce the good people and invade Elang Tacheng. Shicai then led a large army out of the province to suppress them and defeated Ma Heying's troops who had fled to Elang Tacheng. The remnant bandits fled. Ma Heying, seeing our army approaching his nest, sent a letter requesting Shicai and expressing his willingness to obey orders, withdraw from Tushan, and go to the designated Hami to station troops. Wenlong believed that everyone wants to be good, so why not me? If things can be resolved, why not compromise? So he discussed with Shicai to withdraw the army back to the province and set a deadline for departure. For two weeks, Ma Heying not only did not withdraw a step from Tushan, but also instigated his ugly creatures to rob and plunder in Fugu in the east and Jingsha in the west, causing counties to suffer damage. His insidious and ferocious nature is intent on destroying the border situation. In order to protect the territory and defend the people, Shicai had to send troops again to punish them.

<p>(Nanjing) According to information from the Ministry of Finance, the Fujian Customs collects 500,000 yuan per month. The province's salt tax, land tax, and other income are managed independently by the local authorities and there are no precise statistics, but it is estimated to be several hundred thousand yuan per month. However, the central allocation and expenses for the 19th Route Army exceeded 500,000 yuan per month. After the Fujian Incident, these payments were suspended. Therefore, Fujian's seizure of the central government's organs in Fujian has no impact on the central government's fiscal revenue. (26th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) An official from the Customs Administration stated that Fujian originally had Xiamen and Fuzhou Customs and Sandu Ao sub-customs under the jurisdiction of Fujian Customs. The total income of the three customs offices is about 6 million yuan per year, averaging about 500,000 yuan per month, accounting for one-fiftieth of the national customs revenue. The false organization of Fujian Province also sent Chen Youren to negotiate with the Customs Commissioner to request the takeover of Xiamen and Fuzhou Customs. The Customs Commissioner immediately telegraphed Director-General Meller and asked for instructions, and Meller forwarded the matter to Finance Minister Kong for approval. The authorities are considering response measures, but the administration of the two customs offices has not changed as of today. Based on the current situation, if the Fujian Incident cannot be resolved in the short term, the income of the three Fujian customs offices may inevitably be seized. (26th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e25">Salt Merchants' Guild Petition: Safeguarding Salt Affairs Sovereignty - Administrative and Auditing Agencies Should Be Established Separately <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Salt Merchants' Guild has petitioned the Executive Yuan, requesting that the Ministry of Finance be ordered to separately establish the Salt Affairs Bureau and the Salt Affairs Auditing Office to safeguard sovereignty. The petition states that since Yuan Shikai's large-scale foreign loans, a special Salt Affairs Auditing Office was established, headed by foreign advisors recommended by creditor nations, to supervise revenue and expenditure for debt repayment. However, China still maintained administrative power over salt affairs, with officials such as salt commissioners and deputy commissioners of various provinces still appointed by the government. Around 1925 and 1927, in accordance with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, efforts were initiated to abolish unequal treaties, starting with the abolition of auditing offices in Guangdong, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces, dismissal of foreign advisors, and recovery of sovereignty. Subsequently, salt affairs bureaus were established in these provinces, handling auditing matters independently and achieving remarkable results without foreign interference. In 1928, due to further foreign loans, the Ministry of Finance restored the auditing offices that had been recovered, causing national outcry and repeated calls for maintaining the old system. However, due to the urgent need for military expenses during the Northern Expedition, the people reluctantly endured this for a time. After national unification, requests for abolishing the auditing offices were renewed. Unfortunately, last year, Zhu Tingqi, the chief of the Auditing Office, had the Salt Affairs Bureau merged into the Auditing Office, and the powers of salt commissioners were also incorporated into the Office's scope. This was tantamount to handing over the remaining administrative power over salt affairs. Merchants and civilians are running around in fear and confusion. Furthermore, placing administration and auditing in one agency is prone to corruption. The current prevalence of smuggled salt is a direct result of this. The petition requests that national rights and people's livelihoods be protected, the hardships of merchants be considered, and the Ministry of Finance be ordered to separately establish the two agencies, gradually recovering the auditing power over salt affairs. This would be fortunate for the nation and its merchants and people. (26th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) Another case of a foreign ship encountering pirates has occurred in the South China Sea. A few days ago, the police station issued a wireless warning that many bandits had departed from Dapeng Bay and crossed the British territory border with the intention of robbery. Although ships had taken extra precautions, the French ship Henri Poivelaine was still robbed this morning en route from Hong Kong to Haiphong. The incident occurred 30 miles from Aoyan. While the second mate was at the engine, he was suddenly surrounded by several armed thugs. Within minutes, the entire ship was under the control of the pirates, who first destroyed the wireless equipment and seized weapons, and then proceeded to loot. After finishing, they forced the captain to sail to Zhelangjiao. Upon arrival, the pirates fired at small boats, requisitioned two boats, and abducted four Chinese passengers along with 15,000 yuan worth of stolen goods. The robbed ship, with a tonnage of 1,355 tons, belongs to the French company, Xinji (transliteration). (26th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The four Chinese passengers abducted from the French ship are Wu Qing (transliteration), a merchant from Haiphong; Zhang Xinbo, a former Chinese customs official; Lei Hexin (transliteration), a former Guangdong military officer; and Meng Guo (transliteration), a gambler from Guangdong. The captain told passengers that the pirates attacked unexpectedly. Four Annamese guards were stationed on the ship, three of whom were off duty. The one on duty was unable to resist and was captured by the pirates. The compradore, Qi Chang, hid in the cargo hold, and his assistant, Rong, hid in the coal bunker, but both were discovered by the pirates. The safe in the compradore's office was opened, and 800 yuan in cash was looted. When disembarking, the pirates drove the captain and sailors into a lifeboat and towed it away to prevent them from staying on the ship and ramming the pirates' small boats. The captain was beaten by a pirate but was not injured. The captain and others were later released by the pirates. Upon returning to the ship, they repaired the wireless equipment and sent out a distress signal. A British warship heard the alert and came to escort the ship to port. (26th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The French ship Henri Livius, en route from Hong Kong to Haiphong, was robbed by pirates yesterday. The pirates disguised themselves as passengers and boarded the ship in Hong Kong. In the middle of the journey, they suddenly rose up and forced the captain to sail to Qilangjiao (transliteration), stealing ornaments and money totaling about 15,000 yuan and abducting four passengers. Hong Kong police had seen many pirates lingering in the port a few days ago and warned the ships, but they could not be arrested at that time because there was no formal case.

<h3 id="e47">Current Commentary: The Turbulent Far Eastern Political Situation (Continued) (Yes) | The Future of the Chinese Market After the Resumption of Diplomatic Relations Between the United States and the Soviet Union | <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>The resumption of diplomatic relations between the United States and the Soviet Union only indicates the increasing tension in the Far East. The impact of this is limited to making Japan's policy of invading China more roundabout and tortuous. The reason for this was briefly mentioned yesterday. However, under the extremely opposite political and economic positions of these two major countries, what impact will the changes in the economic control war within the Chinese market have after they join hands? It seems that it is also necessary to conduct considerable research. The root cause of today's Far East dispute lies in the inability of the imperialist powers to maintain the balance of power in the Far East market. The Pacific Mandate issue, the Indian market issue, etc., are all reflections of this phenomenon, but they are only local facts. The struggle for the right to control the Chinese market is the center of this fundamental problem. Japan has always regarded itself as the leader of East Asia. Even if the resumption of diplomatic relations between the United States and the Soviet Union may slightly restrain its ambition to aggressively invade territory, it will never be able to curb its disguised economic aggression. This can be asserted.</p>
<p>However, looking at today's Chinese market, which has long been in a state of being devoured by imperialist aggression, coupled with domestic unrest, has bankrupted our rural areas, made cities desolate, production has declined, and purchasing power is weak. The depth of suffering is undeniable. At this time, the general public has no power to save themselves, and the rural landlords and the bourgeoisie only feel that the prosperity is far away. It is very clear that this situation will inevitably fail to promote the beneficial development of the Chinese market. Countries with ambitions for aggression will see this as a good opportunity and more directly intensify their aggression, and more rapidly increase the economic conflicts between these countries. The economic control war within the Chinese market will inevitably become more and more intense.</p>
<p>Looking at recent events, Japan has expanded its basic industries in China, such as the textile and shipping industries, as much as possible, and has also organized a controlled trade agency for China, such as the so-called "Japan-China Trade Co., Ltd." Furthermore, it has established various direct sales agencies in the major trading ports of China. When merchants cannot afford it, they are supported by the government. This is the economic war formation that Japan has expressed towards China after all countries have unanimously resisted Japanese goods. As for Britain and the United States, since they are planning to resist Japanese goods in other markets, they will certainly not fall behind in the Chinese market. For example, the recent US movement to raise the price of silver, and the British Parliament's plan to revitalize the Chinese market, are all beginnings. From this point of view, the economic hegemony of various countries in the Chinese market will inevitably take a more direct and controlled form in the future. The contradiction between the economic forces of various countries will inevitably become more acute in the future. This is the new situation that we must recognize after the resumption of diplomatic relations between the United States and the Soviet Union, and before the armed struggle between various countries. Fellow countrymen, please think about it.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Mussolini Launches League of Nations Restructuring Movement: Seeking to Have the United States, Russia, Germany, and Japan Join to Save the Tense International Situation - Invitation to Litvinov to Visit Italy is Related to This <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>(London) The World News reported today that sources believe Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is launching a movement to expand the power of the League of Nations, seeking to have the United States, Russia, Japan, and Germany join the restructured League. His invitation to Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov to meet in Rome is the beginning of this movement. As for the previous rumors that Italy wanted to withdraw from the League of Nations, it was denied by Mussolini, but sources believe that if the restructuring plan fails, Italy may withdraw. (26th Kuomin Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov, at the invitation of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, has boarded a ship from New York to Rome and is expected to arrive in Italy on December 2. It is said that the Italian Prime Minister's invitation to Litvinov to visit Italy is due to his desire to restore Russia's former status in the world and to participate in the major power meetings convened according to Italian policy. Other issues to be discussed by politicians include the increasingly tense relations between Russia and Japan, which the Italian Prime Minister is concerned about, and the promotion of Russian-Italian trade relations, so that Russia can buy more Italian textiles, and Italy will buy more Russian kerosene. (25th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome Italian newspapers finally revealed the news this evening that Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov will officially visit Italy starting from December 2 of this year. This announcement occupies an important position in the newspapers, but it only announces the facts without adding comments. The Italian side focuses on the Far East issue and the disarmament issue, which makes Litvinov's visit very interesting. We already know what the Italian people think about the rapprochement between the United States and Russia. The Italian side believes that the views of the United States and Russia on Japan are the same as those of Italy. The fact that the United States and Russia can agree is regarded as a fortunate thing by Italy. Rome also believes that the rapprochement between the United States and Russia will allow Soviet Russia to rejoin the international community of major Western powers. It is generally said that although Soviet Russia is not within the League of Nations, it has a major relationship with the disarmament issue, just like the United States. At present, the disarmament issue is being negotiated by the embassies of various countries, at least in the short term, and there is no need for the authorities of various countries to personally take charge. However, it is quite natural for Italy to want to directly express its views to the Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar. Italy and Soviet Russia have good relations, as evidenced by the recent visit of two Soviet Russian cruisers to the Italian port of Naples. (25th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e49">Important Developments in Franco-German Relations: Hitler Receives French Ambassador Poncet, Negotiating Through Geneva <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>(London) There were two important developments in Franco-German relations yesterday. While British Foreign Secretary Simon was giving a speech in the House of Commons, the French Ambassador to Germany, Poncet, was received by German Chancellor Hitler. This was the first time since September. At a time when Simon advocated direct talks between France and Germany, French Ambassador Poncet has almost opened these talks. Another thing to note is that the German Ambassador to Italy is now going to Berlin for instructions, and League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol is still a guest of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. According to Berlin news, Poncet and Hitler are now discussing the German policy disclosed by the Little Parisian Daily. It is said that the German Chancellor claimed that such announcements only increase international suspicion. However, according to news from the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the conversation between the French Ambassador and the German Chancellor was very important, but what was discussed was of a general nature. Paris welcomes direct negotiations, because the path between France and Germany has been connected to Geneva. The French seem unwilling to rely on British intervention to succeed, and negotiations under the Four-Power Pact are also close to Italian intervention. (25th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) German Chancellor Hitler received French Ambassador Poncet today. It is said that the method of Franco-German disarmament negotiations was discussed. It is expected that negotiations will be conducted after the establishment of the new French cabinet. (25th Kuomin Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol came to Rome to attend the funeral of the Italian former representative to the League of Nations, Xie Lejia. This evening, the French Ambassador to Italy, Shang Bolan, hosted a banquet to welcome him. After Avenol met with Prime Minister Mussolini, he issued a statement. Most of the Italian newspapers commented on this statement, saying, "When Avenol met with the Prime Minister, he must have discussed the issue of disarmament in conjunction with the operation of the League of Nations. At present, all parties are trying to make the disarmament conference achieve a favorable solution. The conversation between the Italian Prime Minister and Avenol will be of great benefit to this effort." (25th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) Regarding the temporary suspension of the disarmament conference and the replacement with normal diplomatic negotiations, the Sunday newspapers here have mixed emotions. They are happy that this diplomatic procedure can allow Germany to directly explain its demands and France to directly explain its concerns. In this way, the disarmament issue may make practical progress. They are sad because this move will undermine the credibility of the disarmament conference and the League of Nations.

<p>(Tokyo) In order to break through the international crisis of 1935, Foreign Minister Hirota should first start by adjusting US-Russian relations. In particular, concrete and effective countermeasures must be decided between Japan and the United States regarding the revision of the London Naval Treaty. The five-minister conference has already established the great principle of non-war between Japan and the United States, and the implementation methods have been discussed with the army, navy, finance department, and other relevant departments on the implementation methods and technical research. Now, preparations are about to begin. The exercise items are recorded as follows: (1) Foreign Minister Hirota visited US Ambassador to Japan Grew on October 12 to exchange views for his foreign affairs work and had a long and sincere conversation. It is also planned to invite the US Ambassador to have another sincere conversation at the Foreign Minister's official residence on November 27. (2) For the successor of the Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Debuchi, the best people in China and abroad will be widely sought and made to work hard to open the current deadlock between Japan and the United States. It is currently being sought from all parties. (3) For internal work, the Navy will set up a 1935 Disarmament Countermeasures Committee, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will set up a liaison committee with the military in the European and American Affairs Bureau. Recently, for disarmament countermeasures, not only will there be relations with the European and American Bureaus, but the Treaty Bureau and the Asian Bureau will be added to set up a full committee. (4) Within the full committee established by the above-mentioned Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the military, the countermeasures of the disarmament conference will be studied, not only in the technical scope such as the Japan-US naval ratio, but also the expansion of the purpose of the Pacific Islands equipment restriction agreement and the increase of all political strategies sent by Japan and the United States to observe national defense security must also be studied in detail and discussed.

<h3 id="e54">Difficulties with the Japanese Budget Proposal; Navy Ministry's Attitude Quite Firm; Future of Political Situation Not Optimistic <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) It has been ten days since the first budget meeting was held on November 17, but the budget issue remains unresolved. The Army, Navy, and Agriculture and Forestry Ministries are particularly opposed to the Ministry of Finance. It is reported that the Army Ministry has slightly changed its attitude since yesterday, reducing its original request for 108 million yen to below 70 million yen to seek a compromise with the Ministry of Finance. The Agriculture and Forestry Ministry is requesting an additional 33 million yen, but the Ministry of Finance only approved 3 million yen. Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Goto, at yesterday's national internal affairs chiefs' conference, outlined the key points of the dispute between the Agriculture and Finance Ministries, implicitly seeking assistance from local officials to resolve rural issues. The attending internal affairs chiefs surprisingly resolved to urge the government to quickly resolve the anxieties of farmers' lives, restraining the financial authorities. However, the Navy Ministry still insists on its original proposal, so Finance Minister Takahashi plans to seek a political solution with Navy Minister Osumi, Army Minister Araki, and Agriculture and Forestry Minister Goto in the next two days, to implement his "national defense first" principle. Japanese fascists and military personnel are seizing the opportunity to begin activities. The other day, they used the name of Prince Konoe, Speaker of the House of Peers, to propagate that there would be a coup d'état on November 20. Recently, they have been propagating that the Saito Cabinet will step down by the end of the month due to the budget issue. The financial and economic communities are very uneasy. Premier Saito therefore dared not go to Hayama for recuperation, staying in Tokyo to mediate the dispute. (Hwa Lian News Agency Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Seiyukai party is paying close attention to the development of the political situation centered on the budget. The views of the party's leadership are generally as follows: If the Navy's demand for revival is not recognized, Navy Minister Osumi will face difficulties in controlling the Navy, and the problem may become significant. Therefore, Premier Saito and others are taking on the role of mediators to overcome this difficulty. Meanwhile, the Army remains silent. Outside of the budget issue, the Army hopes for fundamental reforms to internal affairs based on national defense. If the Navy budget is resolved, issues concerning the agriculture and forestry budget related to internal affairs may recur, and because they are very delicate, difficult situations may arise until early next month, making the future political situation not optimistic.

<p>(Irkutsk) It is reported today that after the puppet authorities in Manchuria continued to arrest 33 Russian personnel from the Chinese Eastern Railway, the Russian Consul General in Harbin has lodged a protest, expressing the Russian government's displeasure with the continued detention of the arrested Russian personnel from the Chinese Eastern Railway, and stating that there have reportedly been instances of forced confessions. It is said that the puppet authorities, regarding the continued arrest of these individuals, claimed that they must wait until the investigation is complete before responding to the reasons for the arrests. (Guomin Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) It has been learned here that Soviet Consul General to Harbin, Slavutsky, visited Shi Liben, the negotiator for the puppet state, to inquire about the case of the Soviet officials in charge of the Chinese Eastern Railway who were arrested two months ago. In this case, there have been no specific charges against the arrested personnel to date. Shi agreed to explain this issue to the authorities. Slavutsky also made representations regarding the illegal arrests of Soviet residents in this city and the unfounded retaliatory actions taken by the Manchurian police authorities against Soviet residents. When Slavutsky described the various ways in which Soviet residents were being oppressed, he pointed out that these actions clearly indicate that the Manchurian authorities are systematically mistreating Soviet residents, and that this move is particularly important in light of the authorities' attitude towards inciting White Russian organizations. Slavutsky asked Shi to pay serious attention to this situation and "warn about this policy." (TASS Telegram, 25th)</p>

<p>(London) Anglo-Russian trade treaty negotiations, which were stalled in April of this year due to the case of the employees of the Lena Goldfields Company, have recently resumed, with good prospects. Several issues have now been agreed upon. The greatest difficulty lies with the Lena Goldfields Company, which is seeking US$13 million in compensation from the Soviet Union for violating the mining concession granted in 1925. It is now believed that the British authorities are advocating setting the claim at £3.5 million, while the Russian side is only willing to pay £1 million. If this dispute can be settled on an agreed figure, the signing of a new treaty between the two countries will not be long delayed. (Reuters Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) Although Anglo-Russian trade negotiations have not reached a stalemate, they seem to be encountering various difficulties. The crux of the matter is the issue of Article 20 of the Ottawa Agreement. It now seems that it can be resolved on the following basis: that the United Kingdom cannot prohibit the import of Russian goods without giving three months' prior notice. As for the damages of £13,000,000 for the Lena Goldfields (a mine jointly operated by Russia and England in which British capital was confiscated), the Soviet representatives have not yet proposed any solution. The United Kingdom has also requested that the Soviet Union guarantee a corresponding proportion of British goods imported into Russia, according to the quantity of Russian goods imported into England.

<p>(Paris) The Vietnam affairs group of the French Colonial Conference met today to discuss various issues related to Vietnam. The most important of these are: (1) the threat of China's increased import duties on foreign rice; (2) the current status of negotiations between the Chinese government and the French ambassador regarding the annex to the Vietnam trade treaty; and (3) the competition between Japanese industries and French industries in the mainland and Vietnam. Regarding the Japanese commercial competition issue, a report was already submitted at the International Cotton Industry Committee meeting held in Mulhouse, France on October 19, and at the International Silk Industry Federation meeting opened in Paris on the 14th of this month. The Vietnam affairs group reiterated this today and resolved to draft a memorandum, presenting the relationship between the Japanese commercial competition issue and various Vietnamese products, based on Vietnam's observations.

<p>(Paris) Doumergue has formally accepted the position of Prime Minister. (Reuters Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Doumergue is now proceeding with the formation of a cabinet. It is likely that his recruitment of personnel will be slightly broader than before. It is rumored that the New Socialist Party and the right-wing Republican Party are also being recruited. As for his general policy, it will be the consolidation of national finances and waiting for the right opportunity in the international situation. It is said that when Doumergue left the Presidential Palace, he expressed considerable optimism about the success of his cabinet formation. (Guomin Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) As expected, President Lebrun asked Herriot this afternoon to assume the post of Prime Minister. Herriot declined due to his recent recovery from illness and inability to handle strenuous work. The President then summoned Doumergue for a half-hour private talk. Doumergue has taken on the task of forming a cabinet. It is said that it cannot be formed until the evening of the day after tomorrow at the earliest. However, Doumergue is determined, and it is likely to be successful, because Doumergue's cabinet formation is in fact Herriot's cabinet, and it has the support of the powerful leader of the Radical Socialist Party. Paul-Boncour will almost certainly remain as Foreign Minister, so the foreign policy will not change. Doumergue told news reporters that he intends to balance the budget immediately, uphold the parliamentary system, and focus on the security of France. Doumergue previously held the premiership in 1930, but was overthrown on the day he attended parliament. He has been the Minister of Interior in four cabinets in the past 18 months.

<p>(Paris) The delegations of the left-wing political parties held a meeting in the Chamber of Deputies, but did not reach any concrete results. Léon Blum, leader of the "New Socialist Party of France," attempted to restore the left-wing coalition and make the left-wing party delegations a permanent body, so that they could take charge of future political debates, but this proposal failed due to the opposition of the orthodox faction of the Socialist Party. This shows that the orthodox faction of the Socialist Party is unwilling to participate in other existing political groups outside the party to support the future government. The left-wing party delegations are scheduled to meet again tomorrow evening. (Havas Telegram, 25th)</p>

<h3 id="e72">North China Under Active War Preparations by Japan and Russia; Japanese Troops Secretly Deployed to North Manchuria; Japanese Goods Dumped in North China to Absorb Cash; Japanese and Korean Ruffians Rampant in the War Zone; Puppet State Banknotes in Circulation as Far as Tangshan <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Peiping Correspondence: The Japanese warlords are preparing to create a second world war. Their war preparation goals are to use the Navy to deal with Britain and the United States, and the Army to confront Soviet Russia. After the resumption of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia, the situation has changed dramatically. The Japanese military preparations have become even more active. On one hand, they are trying to resolve the Sino-Japanese issue to avoid being constrained in the rear, and on the other hand, they are increasing troops in North Manchuria to prevent any possible war. Most of the Japanese troops stationed along the Great Wall have already been moved north. Recently, they have again been transporting a large number of troops from Japan to Manchuria, landing at the port of Rajin, and transporting them to the Harbin area via Jilin. A large number of cavalry, artillery, and air force units have also been deployed to Manchuria Station, near the Russian border. Troop transportation is mostly done at night, and strict secrecy is maintained from the outside world. Information about North Manchuria is transmitted by air every day to ensure speed and avoid leakage. After the news of the Japanese aircraft suddenly flying into Russian territory on the 8th of this month was released, it was also rumored in the puppet state that Russian aircraft had once scouted the Harbin and Changchun areas. Japan and the puppet state are planning to move the capital of the puppet state to Lushun for safety reasons in case of war between Japan and Russia, because Changchun, the capital of the puppet state, is closer to the Russian border and is vulnerable to Russian aircraft attacks, so as to facilitate protection.</p>
<p>The Japanese authorities are desperately coping with this serious situation, but their financial and material resources are insufficient to meet the needs. Therefore, they regard the four northeastern provinces and North China as their only external treasury. For the four northeastern provinces, on the one hand, they are extracting resources through the puppet organization, and on the other hand, they are still using monetary policies to concentrate cash and promote gold notes (Japanese banknotes are called gold notes in the Northeast) as much as possible in the northeastern provinces, absorbing cash back to the country. Recently, due to the proliferation of gold notes and the extremely tight financial situation in the country, the price of gold notes in the northeastern provinces has fallen daily, with each yuan worth only 90 cents in silver. At the same time, the puppet state also issued puppet banknotes in the name of the puppet Central Bank. The banknotes are divided into several denominations, such as one yuan, five yuan, ten yuan, fifty yuan, one hundred yuan, five hundred yuan, and one thousand yuan, and there are also corner notes such as one jiao, two jiao, and five jiao. The puppet banknotes are printed by the Japanese. The national flag of the puppet state is printed on the upper right corner of the front, and two articles of the puppet state's monetary law are printed on the back, which is quite unique. A large number of puppet banknotes have been issued, flooding the market. Silver dollars have disappeared, and it has become a world of paper money. Affected by the war, the Japanese domestic industry is in recession, and factory output exceeds demand. All the circulating capital has become stagnant output. Under this economic downturn, each factory and businessman must also do their best for national use in preparation for the war. They have no choice but to regard the Northeast and North China as their tail, implementing the dumping of goods. In recent months, Japanese goods imported into North China have increased dramatically. The markets in Peiping and Tianjin are flooded with Japanese goods, and the prices are lower than ever before. General merchants, greedy for profit, are competing to sell them, and the sales of Japanese goods have become very widespread, and the resources transferred to the enemy are also countless. At the same time, the Japanese army is using force to protect Japanese and Korean ruffians, selling drugs, harming our people, and absorbing our money. Local authorities know this but cannot prohibit it. Even an occasional intervention will lead to negotiations. It is even more unbearable to ask about the situation within the war zone. Because it is under the power of the Japanese army, everything is controlled by the Japanese army. Puppet banknotes are now circulating as far as Tangshan. Therefore, North China is now the same as the Northeast before the September 18th Incident. The future is truly unimaginable. (November 25th)</p>
<h3 id="e73">North China; All Armies Will Be Downsized Again; Due to Extreme Difficulties with Military Spending <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Peiping Correspondence: Although military spending in North China has been reduced repeatedly, it still requires 4,965,000 yuan per month as of now. The budget for formal troops is 4,520,000 yuan. After the Chahar incident is resolved, the incorporated miscellaneous troops will cost approximately 440,000 yuan. However, of the military spending in North China, in addition to the 3.5 million yuan allocated by the Central Government each month, 850,000 yuan is reported by Hebei, Chahar, and Peiping, and 210,000 yuan is reported by the Peiping-Liaoning and Peiping-Suiyuan Railways and Tianjin to help. However, since Hebei and Chahar provinces were ravaged by war, local finances have also been difficult. Therefore, they have stopped reporting one after another, and the troops' salaries are only supported by the subsidy allocated by the Central Government, with a large difference each month. Therefore, only the sixth salary has been paid, and when the seventh salary can be paid is still far away. The Central Government and local authorities owe the Military Affairs Commission a total of 8,210,000 yuan as of the end of July, and this does not include the amount owed since August. At the routine meeting of the Military Affairs Commission the other day, the generals had a long discussion on this issue. The opinions can be summarized into three points: (1) The living expenses of the armies will be changed to monthly salary payments; (2) The central subsidy will be distributed equally first; (3) Borrowing will be used to provide assistance first, and the balance will be paid off at the end of the month, but none of these are appropriate solutions, so they dispersed without any results. In the intention of the authorities, the current finances in North China are depleted, and military spending is huge. If relief measures are not taken as soon as possible, the future will be very dangerous. Therefore, they still hope that the provinces and cities can continue to do their best to assist, and they plan to make every effort to downsize the armies again. However, this method is complicated and is currently being carefully planned. In addition to military spending, disaster relief matters in the war zone also urgently need to be carried out in North China. The North China War Zone Agricultural Relief Group has now started to provide loans for agricultural relief in Zunhua, Fengrun, and Xuanhua counties, and last week sent personnel to Huairou, Miyun, Pinggu, Ji County, and Qian'an counties to conduct investigations. Once the investigation is completed, cooperatives will be organized to implement loans. According to Zhang Yuanshan, head of the Agricultural Relief Group, the agricultural relief work of this association should have started earlier, but the relief funds have not been allocated, which has delayed the full handling of the matter. However, this work cannot be delayed for too long, so the 130,000 yuan of relief funds raised by donations has been used to start the investigation and loan work in the eight counties of Xuanhua, etc. He estimated that the agricultural relief work will be completed before February of next year. Regarding the issuance of war zone public bonds, the North China War Zone Relief Committee is scheduled to convene a meeting of standing committee members this Saturday to discuss and consult on the issuance methods. The issuance procedures for public bonds are roughly divided into three stages: (1) Organizing a management committee; (2) Printing public bond tickets; (3) Contacting the banking industry to promote sales. It is estimated that after this standing committee meeting, the war zone public bonds can be issued and will not be affected by any parties. The agricultural relief portion of the relief funds is planned to be 300,000 yuan in public bond tickets. If these public bonds can be sold out in a short period of time, the agricultural relief progress will not be hindered. According to Zhang, emergency relief work has now been completed in four-fifths, so it has been decided to complete the work by the end of this month. (23rd)</p>

<p>Hankou Correspondence: Following the outbreak of the Fujian Incident, the generals of the various provinces along the Yangtze River were said to have jointly telegraphed requesting the punishment of Chen. After He Chengjun returned to Hankou, he telegraphed the military leaders stationed in Hubei about the situation in Fujian. In the days that followed, he received replies from Xu Yuanquan, Sun Lianzhong, Liang Guanying, Chen Jicheng, and others, all requesting that a telegram be sent to the Central Government, clearly ordering a punitive expedition. On the 25th, twenty-seven generals jointly telegraphed the capital and notified all parties, unanimously condemning Chen, with the telegram stating, "As the national crisis arises, both internal and external enemies encroach upon us. With the victory reported in Jiangxi, we were all relieved. However, Chen Mingshu and others, at this critical juncture, suddenly caused chaos in Fuzhou, betraying the nation. The rebellious party colluded with the communists internally and with the Japanese externally. They also gathered together the so-called Third Party, the Social Democratic Party, and the Communist Liquidationists, melting them into one furnace, establishing a separate name, calling it 'Production,' defacing the Premier's portrait, abolishing the Blue Sky with a White Sun flag, establishing a military agreement with the Red bandits, secretly agreeing to political conditions with the enemy, providing the communists with ammunition, and accepting huge sums of money from the enemy. They are both red and white, neither one nor the other. This is indeed a strange and unprecedented event since the establishment of the Republic of China, and it is something that our Premier and the martyrs who died for the country would weep over in their graves. Chen Mingshu, as a member of the Central Committee, willingly committed this act. The generals and soldiers of the Nineteenth Route Army are also being held hostage and cannot extricate themselves. If this continues for a long time, it will eventually lead to collapse. However, we fear that this will allow the communists to prolong their lives and allow foreigners to take the opportunity to invade, and the disaster will be endless. Chengjun and others, as soldiers, are tasked with suppressing the rebellion. If there is an order, we will do our best. We earnestly request the Central Government to issue a grand decree, clearly stating the plan for the punitive expedition, so that the sparks do not become a prairie fire, and the trickle of water does not become a flood. Moreover, the Fujian rebellion nurtures the seeds of internal and external troubles. If we do not remove this hidden danger, it will eventually become a major problem. We hope that all virtuous people will understand their cruelty, share the same hatred, uphold justice together, and unanimously condemn them, so that these traitors will disappear, and those who were coerced will turn to righteousness. Externally, we will cut off the Japanese's covetous desires, and internally, we will eliminate the remnants of the communists. In this way, the foundation of the nation will not be shaken, and the people's livelihood will be secured. We urgently present our words, hoping for your wise consideration. He Chengjun, Xu Yuanquan, Sun Lianzhong, Liang Guanying, Chen Jicheng, Shangguan Yunxiang, Fan Shisheng, Xiao Zhichu, Hao Mengling, Peng Zhenshan, Guo Rudong, Chen Yaohan, Zhang Wanxin, Wan Yaohuang, Feng Xingxian, Zhang Zhenhan, Li Jingming, Rong Jingfang, Ye Peng, Liu Yifeng, Luo Qijiang, Liu Peixu, Pan Shanzhai, Li Zongjian, Li Dingwu, Jiang Zuojun, Zhang Gang, respectfully submit." On the same day, He and others also received a telegram from Liu Zhi, Chairman of Henan Province, and provincial committee members Zhang Qian, Li Wenhao, Zhang Jingyu, Qi Zhenru, and Wan Wujing, which stated, "Chen Mingshu and others have seized Fuzhou, gathered reactionary elements, established a separate name, slandered the government, destroyed the constitution, and betrayed the party and the nation. At this time of national crisis and intense suppression of the communists, the whole country should be united to uphold the Central Government in order to secure internal stability, resist foreign aggression, and save the nation from danger. However, Chen Mingshu and others are creating chaos and harming the country. All who have blood in their veins are indignant. In addition to telegraphing the Central Government to await further orders, we hope that everyone will rise up together to quell the rising chaos in order to uphold discipline and strengthen the foundation of the nation." He and others immediately replied in response. During this period, the Hubei region was very peaceful. The bandit suppression army, except for the 31st Division of Li Jingming, which was transferred to southern Hubei to guard the northern section of the Hunan-Hubei Railway, remained in their original defenses and continued to search for and suppress the remaining bandits.

<h3 id="e75">Lu Antiquities Research Association to Excavate the Ancient Capital of the Zhu State; Excavations at Anshang Village and the Tomb of Cao Wang Have Been Completed <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Dong Zuobin of the Shandong Antiquities Research Association and others have completed their excavation of Anshang Village and the Tomb of Cao Wang in Teng County. They discovered divination turtle shells, pottery shards, clam tools, stone tools, Han Dynasty stone carvings, human bones, etc., which are commonly found elsewhere and have no special value. The work has now ended. Wang Xiantang, director of the Shandong Provincial Library (Wang is also a member of the Shandong Antiquities Research Association), went to Teng County to meet with Dong Zuobin to discuss going to Zou County to conduct a survey in preparation for excavating the ancient capital of the Jiwangcheng ancient Da Zhu state, searching for the culture of the Spring and Autumn period. The Zhu state of the Spring and Autumn period was later divided into three. The capitals of the Lan and Xiao Zhu states were both in Teng County. The Zhu state (i.e., Da Zhu) was in Zou County. Jiwangcheng, more than twenty li south of Mount Yi in Zou County, is its capital. (According to the ancient pronunciation, Ji is Zhi, which is the transliteration of Zhu.) Many bronze artifacts have been found there before. Most of the archaeological bronze artifacts are unearthed here, with dozens of types recorded. Furthermore, pottery shards with writing are often found in the county, which are quite valuable. In our country, pottery shards with writing have been found only in Shaanxi and Shandong. In Shaanxi, the culture of the Qin state can be studied. In Shandong, there are Zibo and Zou County. There are many characters on the pottery shards in Zibo, which can be used to study the culture of the Qi state. There are fewer characters on the pottery shards in Zou County, which can be used to study the culture of the Zhu state. In recent years, after rain in the fields of Zou County, they have often been discovered. Children sell them to people for rescue. The above-mentioned bronze artifacts and pottery shards with writing are all in an important position in the archaeological world. It is expected that the value of future excavations will be above that of the Anshang Village Cao Wang tomb. (24th)</p>
<h3 id="e76">Liu Zhi Returns to Bianliang, Discusses the Inspection Tour of Wushe and Lin Counties <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: Liu Zhi left Bianliang on the 15th for northern Henan, inspecting engineering projects in the Zhengzhou Miaogong area. After inspecting Wuzhi, Daokou, and Huaxian, he took a special train north from Xinxiang to Handan, disembarked, and turned west to inspect Wu'an, Shexian, and Linxian. He returned by train from Zhangde, stopped briefly in Zhengzhou, and returned to Bianliang this afternoon. According to his account, the mountain roads from Wu'an to Shexian and Linxian are rugged, and cars cannot travel on them. The Zhang River winds around, sometimes climbing mountains, sometimes wading through water. Among them, Qingfeng Mountain in Shexian has cliffs and steep walls, and transportation is particularly inconvenient. Even sedan chairs and horses cannot be used. Therefore, in five days, he only traveled three hundred and twenty li. The highways in the three counties, Shexian and Linxian, have only been partially built. Wu'an is currently starting construction. These three counties are located in the northwest corner of Henan, bordering Hebei and Shanxi. The mountains are precipitous, and the roads are dangerous. Wu'an has many merchants doing business outside, so the economy is quite sufficient. However, customs are extravagant, and both men and women like to dress up. In Shexian and Linxian, because there are many mountains and little land, people's livelihoods are difficult. Many people use bran and persimmon fruits, ground into crumbs to fill their hunger. The people of Shexian are simple and honest, while the people of Linxian are contentious and fond of fighting. However, the Tianmen Society bandits have long been suppressed, and social order is stable. Although the bad customs of keeping queues, foot binding, and superstition have not been eliminated, education is still developed, and political achievements are also good. However, the prevalence of drugs is a major disaster in these three counties. The flood in Huaxian is extremely serious. The fifth, sixth, and seventh districts are almost completely submerged, with only one village remaining in the fifth district with one hundred and twenty-six villages, three villages remaining in the sixth district with one hundred and fifty-three villages, and two villages remaining in the seventh district with one hundred and sixty-three villages. The land has turned into a swamp, and it is still a vast expanse of water. Dozens of miles around Baliying, Anshang Village, and Nanyangliu and other villages are submerged in water with broken tiles and crumbling walls. Hundreds of thousands of disaster victims are crying for food and shivering from the cold, homeless. County Chief Xie Suian has selected male and female disaster victims with farming ability, quickly investigated and reported, in order to move them to the special zone in southern Henan, it is said.

<p>Taian Correspondence: After the Fujian Incident occurred, Feng Yuxiang, who was residing in Mount Tai, attracted considerable attention from the people of the country. It was rumored that Feng had some contact with the Fujian uprising. The major reasons were: 1. Xu Qian, who once served as Feng's representative, is currently an important figure in Fujian; 2. According to a certain source, Feng was recommended by Fujian as a member of the new government. In fact, Feng did not seem to approve of the Fujian side's measures. It is said that representatives from Fujian had visited Feng in Mount Tai beforehand. Feng stated that since returning to Mount Tai, he was merely one of the common people and did not want to participate in any political occasions again. He only hoped to have the opportunity to read and practice calligraphy every day, which he felt was sufficient. Feng's guards in Mount Tai originally numbered one thousand five hundred, but four to five hundred people were recently laid off and dismissed separately. Currently, there are about one thousand people remaining. Feng's daily expenses are supplemented by Song Zheyuan and Han Fuqu, so he does not feel it is too difficult. Feng practices calligraphy and reads books every day in the mountains. He rarely receives guests other than his former subordinates. Feng does not express his opinions on the current situation. Recently, he has had no intention of going to Beijing. The rumor that the Central Government invited Feng to Beijing is not true. When asked about the Fujian incident, he stated that he had only seen it in the newspapers and had not heard the details. The rumor that he participated is purely untrue, it is said. (24th)</p>

<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Zhu Peng's various bands recently invaded Yihuang Jinxi from the Fujian border in two routes. They were severely damaged by the National Army at Xuwan and Daxiongguan, and they collapsed and retreated south. Since the outbreak of the Fujian Incident, Zhu Mao and others have had no worries about the rear and have repeatedly launched counter-offensives in an attempt to advance north. Fortunately, the National Army built solid fortifications, defending as an offensive, so Zhu Mao and others never succeeded. According to front-line news, after Lin Biao's band was defeated by the troops of Li Yannian, Guo Siyuan, and Wu Qiwai, they recovered Dangkou and Shengang in the area bordering Nanfeng and Yihuang. However, on the 24th, Lin and the 123rd Division of the Pseudo First Army Corps and the 14th Division of the Pseudo Fifth Army Corps attacked Daxiongguan again, but were still repelled by Li's troops. The bandits retreated south to Xiongfang in Nanfeng, and a small number fled south of Dangkou. Furthermore, according to a telegram from Wu Qiwai, Commander of the Fourth Army, "This army fought fiercely with the bandits of the Pseudo One-Five Army Corps for eight hours in Shengang and the area south of it in Yihuang County on the 19th. The main bandits, who claimed to be stubborn and fierce, were decisively defeated in this short period of time. Unfortunately, due to the mountainous terrain and narrow terrain, they could not be completely annihilated and escaped at night. It is estimated that more than a thousand bandits were killed, and about two thousand were wounded and captured. The defeated bandits have fled south in a panic. Now the Pseudo One-Three-Five-Seven Army Corps have been defeated one after another. The bandit flames, which have been invincible for a year, have been extinguished in one fell swoop. After this severe blow, it will surely accelerate their collapse. Wu Qiwai, (second address second), seal" (24th)</p>
<h3 id="e79">Implementation Measures for the Prohibition of Opium in Various Counties and Cities of Anhui Province; Soil Paste Shops Must Register with the Civil Affairs Department; Smokers Must Obtain Licenses and Pay a License Fee of Two Yuan <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Since Anhui Province established a special tax for the prohibition of opium, there have been many merchants and opium soil and paste can be bought everywhere. Recently, the provincial government issued provisional measures for the implementation of opium prohibition in various counties and cities throughout the province, stipulating that anyone who wants to be a soil paste shop and smoker must follow the regulations and apply for registration with the Department of Civil Affairs in order to be quick. Smokers must apply for a smoking cessation license and pay two yuan. The measures are as follows: (1) The registration and registration of soil paste shops and smokers in various counties and cities shall be handled by the respective counties. In the cities of Anqing, Datong, Wuhu, Bengbu, Tunxi, Zhengyang, and Linhuai, it shall be handled by the respective Public Security Bureaus. However, rural areas not under the jurisdiction of the Public Security Bureaus shall still be handled by the county governments. (2) Opium cessation affairs in various counties and cities should be handled by the opium dens established by the county governments and Public Security Bureaus, or entrusted to local public and private hospitals. (3) When counties and bureaus apply to the Department of Civil Affairs for smoking cessation licenses and travel permits produced by the Special Tax Office of Hubei, each smoking cessation license should first be advanced with two yuan, and the travel permit should be advanced with one yuan and five jiao. (4) The number of soil paste shops in each county and city shall be quickly determined by the county governments and Public Security Bureaus, taking into account local conditions, and submitted to the Department of Civil Affairs for review and approval within ten days after receiving these measures. A letter shall be sent to the Special Tax Office for verification and reported to the provincial government for record. (5) Anyone who wants to be a soil paste shop must follow the provisions of Articles 8 and 10 of the Soil Paste Shop Regulations and prepare one-quarter of the first phase of the annual license fee according to the grade, together with a reliable business number term of one-quarter of the second phase of the annual license fee, and report it to the county government or Public Security Bureau for assessment and verification. The matter shall be forwarded to the Department of Civil Affairs for approval. Without the approval of the Department of Civil Affairs and the issuance of a license, it shall not be allowed to operate without authorization and shall not directly apply to the Special Tax Office for issuance in order to show uniformity. In addition to the foregoing procedures, anyone who wants to be a soil paste shop may directly apply to the Department of Civil Affairs in accordance with the regulations in order to be quick. (6) At the end of each month, each county and bureau shall separately list the number and number of licenses issued and received, as well as the revenue and expenditure deposits and withdrawals, and report them for investigation. The funds required by its opium cessation agencies must also be prepared in advance and approved before they can be used. (7) Before the establishment of the Opium Prohibition Office of the Department of Civil Affairs, the funds that should be paid according to regulations for the licenses issued by the Special Tax Office of Hubei must be paid separately to the Department of Civil Affairs to clear the procedures. (8) The license fees obtained by each county and bureau, in addition to the approved expenditures, if there is any surplus, shall be transferred to the successor after making a register when the old and new are handed over, and shall be reported to the Department of Civil Affairs for record. (9) Opium prohibition matters in various counties and cities may be handled by the Department of Civil Affairs, taking into account local conditions, and assigning a chief auditor to assist the county government and Public Security Bureau. The required salary and official expenses shall be paid by the respective county and bureau from the two yuan of the license fee distributed according to regulations. (10) If there are any matters not covered by these measures, the Department of Civil Affairs may submit them to the provincial government for revision at any time. (23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e80">Wuhu Electricity Strike; The Whole City Has Stopped Using Electricity for Two Days <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Stores and residents in Wuhu City, because the electricity price charged by Mingyuan Electric Light Company is particularly expensive compared to other ports. The price was increased again a year ago due to the increase in coal prices, but after the coal price returned to normal, the electricity price was not restored accordingly. Several requests for reduction have not been met. Recently, because the company revised its new regulations, the treatment of users is even more harsh. Therefore, the Wuhu Electric Light Users Association was organized to strongly request improvement and price reduction. Subsequently, the Commissioner's Office and the Public Security Bureau convened several meetings between the two parties to discuss mediation. The official decided on four measures and announced them for users to comply with: (1) The electricity fee will remain at 22 cents per kilowatt-hour; (2) The electricity base will be reduced by two kilowatt-hours according to the original table; (3) No labor costs will be charged for connecting electricity, and the materials will be paid for by the users, and the liquor money will be optional; (4) If the user believes that the installed meter has too many amperes, they can request the company to replace it with a smaller meter. However, the users believed that the electricity price still could not be reduced slightly, and it was particularly difficult to win in this time of economic depression. They still insisted on continuing to fight, and notified all users that they could pay the fee according to the price after the electricity price was resolved, and should not intentionally destroy it. The night before last, the Mingyuan Company sent personnel to the Kuishengzhai Department Store and Hat Shop at the intersection of Malu and Gongyuan Roads to collect electricity fees. The shop paid a certain amount first, and the remaining amount would be settled after the electricity price was resolved. The company insisted on not agreeing, and immediately cut off the electricity line, which immediately aroused the public anger of the prosperous district shops along Zhongshan Road and Siming Road. They unanimously turned off the electric lights and used candles and kerosene lamps to show their support. Suddenly, the city became dark and dim, and unusually desolate. The military and police authorities, because of the unstable situation at this time, the city-wide power outage, and the impact on local order, dispatched the entire team to maintain and persuade along the way. However, the users believed that this move was purely to promote the company's awareness. If the goal was not achieved, they would rather not use electric lights, and would never be coerced by the company. Until the evening of the 20th, the trend became more and more expanded, and the act of refusing to use electric lights had spread to the Fourth Pier and other places. The Shoe Industry Association and others also held emergency meetings one after another, deciding to ask all industries in the city to voluntarily stop using electricity to provide assistance. Recently, the Wuhu Workers' Organization Instructor's Office, because the trend was expanding and the relationship with local security was very important, issued a notice requesting representatives of both parties to meet at the office at 1 pm on the 21st to discuss a fair solution to avoid causing accidents.

<h3 id="e81">Inspection Notes of Gan, Wan, Xiang, and E. Our Newspaper Special Correspondent Ren An. Overview of the Rural Economy of Zaoyang <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Zaoyang Correspondence: Because the Zaoyang area is not very peaceful, there is still fear of wind and cranes in the poor countryside. Therefore, there is no news of other transfers of local garrison troops, and the local security team has increased without decreasing. According to Mr. Wu of the First District Office of the county, the burden of the local people is, "The whole county has ten districts, raising 9,000 yuan per month, 40 yuan for the military salaries of the garrison, and 5,000 yuan for the security team expenses. In the event of war, victory condolences, and casualties, there are so-called military reception fees and bandit suppression subsidies, with many names, all of which are paid by the people. A Zhou family, with more land, pays more than 1,000 yuan a year in donations and money and food, which is not included. It can be seen that the suffering of the local area is really no less than that of the tenants." After inquiring about why the garrison needs to raise money locally, Wu replied, "All troops with the words 'New Compilation' or 'Independent' in their titles mostly raise their salaries locally. The garrison in our county is an independent 34th brigade unit. The brigade headquarters is located in Suixian. The security issues of the counties along the Xiang (Yang) Hua (Yuan) Road are mostly maintained by the brigade. All military needs are met. Because the military discipline of the brigade has been investigated by the government and is still not bad, a certain amount of money is allocated each month, and the rest is apportioned by the Suizao counties. Our county pays 4,000 yuan a month, which is still relatively light." Passing by the county government gate, I saw more than a dozen carts of grain, cattle, and horses piled up. I passed by again the next day, and what I saw was still the same. However, I felt that there were new ones coming. I strangely asked a car owner in ragged clothes whether they were here to store grain. After a long sigh, the car owner slowly replied, "This is the military rice dispatched by each village. We are in a hurry and there is no way to save ourselves. How can we store grain for future use?" I then asked whether the military rice dispatched was deducted from the 9,000 yuan allocated per month, or was dispatched additionally. The car owner seemed to have other concerns, and turned his head and did not answer.</p>
<p>Land concentration in various villages has mostly become a manor system. The relationship between rent and tenancy, most of the benefits absolutely belong to the local area. If the tenants do not have sufficient capital, there is no hope of farming. For the tenancy procedures, the tenants must pay a deposit to the local area, called Dingtou, also called Yaoke. The amount is arbitrary, with no standard. Generally, if too much Dingtou is paid, the amount of grain money (i.e., rent money, local customs, rent is paid in money instead of grain, called grain money) to be paid each year in the future can be reduced as appropriate, or even eliminated. For example, if there are ten mu of land, each mu is worth 200 strings (each yuan is worth eight strings), a total of 2,000 strings. If the entire land is rented out, the Dingtou can be paid up to 1,500 strings, and then the grain money can be exempted. If the relationship is deeper, there are those who pay taxes for the landlord, otherwise they will generally not care. If the landlord is wealthy and the tenant is reliable, the Dingtou can be paid with no strings, and then 120 strings of grain money must be paid each year. If 300 or 500 strings of Dingtou are paid, then the grain money can be reduced to 90 or 70 strings. In recent years, due to soldiers, bandits, and droughts, land prices have gradually fallen. In the past, many places with abundant seats and thick shoes were frequently in decline. Disputes over stealing farmland were often heard. The so-called "stealing farmland" (actually, the local area only calls it stealing) means that several tenants receive more Dingtou for one piece of land. After being discovered, there is no way to recover it, and the defrauded tenants have to divide the planting according to the number. General rural loans, the interest rate is mostly between 30% and 50%. There is a so-called "Big One Plus", which must pay 10% interest per month, otherwise the principal and interest will generate new interest. For example, if you borrow 10 yuan, you should pay 1 yuan of interest next month. It should be deducted when borrowing, and you actually pay 9 yuan. When the full month is due, you must pay 1 yuan of interest for the next month, otherwise the principal will be made into 11 yuan, and you must pay 1.1 yuan of interest next month. People who borrow "Big One Plus" are not only poor farmers, poor workers, and small business vendors. They often borrow it when they are in urgent need. As for the cruel example of borrowing grain exclusively for farmers, the suffering is even greater than this. Because farmers are subjected to various exploitations, every year at the end of the old year, they just borrow "Big One Plus" to settle old debts (commonly known as borrowing to pay debts). After the new year, they immediately feel a lack of food. To keep the family smoke unbroken, they have no choice but to borrow grain. Ordinary spring borrowing grain, once the new grain is harvested in the autumn, must be repaid. The novel tricks for repayment are as many as three. One is "borrowing grain and repaying grain", that is, borrowing one stone and repaying one stone and four dou, or even two stones. The second is "repaying money and repaying grain", that is, borrowing one stone of grain, and also making a good grain price. When repaying, in addition to repaying one stone of original grain, you must also add the price of one stone of grain according to the estimated good price. Regardless of whether the new grain rises or falls, the lender can maintain its original profit of lending one and repaying two. The third is "borrowing grain and repaying money". The amount of principal and interest to be repaid should be calculated in advance, or interest can be generated on time. As a result, the interest on the loan is always higher than the first two. It is heard that the county government has issued notices to ban the above-mentioned usury methods of borrowing grain and borrowing money. After all, it is difficult to save the stubborn customs and the extreme oppression of the borrowers for a temporary livelihood. They are also willing to drink poison to quench their thirst. It is harmful to the rural economy. I don't know where I will end.</p>
<p>Rural finance has reached the point of exhaustion. Garrison troops, in the name of the Chamber of Commerce, have issued tens of thousands of yuan of copper coins, but due to the limitations of the area, it is difficult to circulate outside the territory. Currently, when urging the autumn grain, each grain is calculated to pay 11 yuan in regular tax and 15 yuan in additional tax, which is too much. Therefore, the opening of the levy is much earlier than the deadline. Compared with previous years, those who complete the payment on time show a decline. Second and third deadlines must be increased by fines and handling fees. Those who have not completed the payment on the surface are indeed as so-called "dare to play the law and deliberately delay," but in fact, the anxiety in the hearts of the defaulting households is increasing day by day. It is heard that a few days ago, an old man from the countryside, because the tax on the recently pawned fields was found to have not been paid for this old field deed, according to the law, either the field deed would be invalidated, or a considerable heavy payment would be fined. The old man was shocked and burned his paper. The manic illness has not ended. The reporter visited the tax payment office and learned that this year's tax payment regulations are roughly that the tax amount is based on the contract price. For "pawned deeds," every 100 yuan should pay regular and additional taxes at 7 yuan within the 9th and 10th months, 8 yuan in the 11th and 12th months, and 9 yuan next year. For "purchase deeds," those who pay in the 9th and 10th months pay 13.2 yuan per 100 yuan, which increases to 15.1 yuan in the 11th and 12th months, and to 17 yuan next year.</p>
<p>The unit names of farmland, Shi and Mu are mixed. There is a difference between "big Shi" and "small Shi" in Shi, and there is a difference between "new face" and "old face" in Mu. The difference between old and new, big and small is always one or two times. The area is different in different regions, and the area size is also different. For example, each Mu of paddy field is usually only half of each Mu of plain dry land. Compared with plain dry land and hillside dry land, it is only one-third or one-quarter of it. One Shi in the southern area has as many as four Mu. One Shi near the city is only half a Mu. Land disputes are mostly due to this reason. Measurement is needed and cannot be delayed. Cotton production is the largest. The annual output value is about 8 million yuan. The northeast two townships produce miscellaneous grains such as wheat, millet, sorghum, and corn. The southwest produces rice and grain, which is enough to eat in a normal year.</p>
<p>The streets in the city are still tidy. There is a joint middle and primary school with nearly 200 students. The Confucius Temple occupies a large area. The construction is based on Qufu. The palace is magnificent and spectacular, and it is the crown of the counties in northern Hubei. However, in recent years, the doors, windows, equipment, and instruments stationed by the army have all been destroyed, which the villagers regret very much.</p>

<p>Recently, there have been frequent robbery cases in various villages in the Shihudang area. In each case, four or five families were robbed in a row. The county government attaches great importance to this matter. The day before yesterday, two water patrol boats were specially dispatched to cruise near the area. After the two patrol boats arrived at Shihudang, they were governed in the Shutang area, and firmly registered and guarded the essentials. Unexpectedly, at about 12 o'clock last night, two suspicious ships were found on the port surface. When the boat was ordered to be watched, it avoided the patrol boat and sped away. The patrolmen fired row guns to show their power. The boat then leaned on the opposite bank, and more than a dozen people who spoke the Chaohu accent jumped out of the boat, carried things ashore and escaped. The patrolmen, because of the dark night, were afraid of accidents, and did not dare to pursue them. After inspecting the boat, there were only a few pounds of salt. The abandoned ships have been guarded by the patrol boats.</p>

<p>Wang Weishen's family, farmers in Beiyuan Township, West Wisteria Gate Port, in the first district, were of modest means. They had two daughters, and sons-in-law named Zhao Fushun and Fushun were brought into the family. The day before yesterday (the 24th), at around 8 p.m., as the whole family, young and old, were about to go to sleep, suddenly more than a dozen robbers arrived. They were dressed in plain clothes, spoke in mixed accents, and carried items such as handguns, wooden sticks, hemp ropes, and candles. They broke into the house, herded the men, women, and children into one room, and tied them up with ropes. They used candles to burn Wang Weishen and his sons-in-law, Zhao Fushun and Fushun, to force them to reveal where they had hidden money. They were robbed of 100 silver dollars, a pair of gold bracelets, a barge, and clothing, among other things.</p>

<p>Chen Shitao, a judge at the county court in this area, has been in office for two years. He is known for his experience, careful handling of cases, and integrity. Therefore, public opinion is favorable to him. However, recently, he was suddenly accused of dereliction of duty to the Ministry of Justice and the High Court. The case involves Sun Zhanqi (also known as Jiru), a lawyer residing in Yingshan River. Recently, in handling a debt case between Chen Meifang and guarantor Feng Xusan, it is alleged that Sun, representing Feng Xusan, bribed Judge Chen with 500 yuan. Consequently, after receiving the report, the High Court believes that the truth of the lawyer's bribery and the judge's acceptance of the bribe should be thoroughly investigated. Yesterday, they specially dispatched Ni Pu (a local), a clerk from the High Court, to Wuxi to investigate.

<p>County Magistrate Yan Shenyu, to alleviate the rural economy, specially convened with the Farmers Bank and the Industry and Commerce Association to establish the agricultural warehouse loan plan for the 21st year. The Farmers Bank and various pawnshops in the countryside will handle the county's agricultural warehouse loans. This was reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that the county government specially issued a notice yesterday. All countryside agents for agricultural warehouse loans, when receiving pledged rice, are required to set the loan interest rate at 1.6% per month. The price of the rice received as collateral should be 70% of the market price. The amount of rice pledged per household should be at least five dou and at most ten shi. Countryside pawnshops will uniformly begin accepting pledges on December 1st. It is also stipulated that all pawnshops in the county's districts and sections acting as agents for pledge loans, if they require funds and are insufficient, may seek funding from the bank, but each period is limited to 100,000 yuan, guaranteed by the county government, the Farmers Bank, and the pawnshop association. It is also heard that the Farmers Bank's own warehouses in Qianqiao in the fourth district and Lishe in the fifteenth district will also begin accepting rice pledges and issuing loans on December 1st. The warehouse in Dongting Town in the tenth district will begin on December 15th, also operating rice milling and storage services for customers.</p>

<p>The Second Battalion of the 523rd Regiment of the 262nd Brigade of the 88th Division of the Army stationed in Changzhou, which had been protecting the railway (the battalion was responsible for the defense from Longtan to Henglin), was ordered to transfer. Battalion Commander Cui Yanfu, upon receiving the order, instructed the troops to move to Changzhou to garrison. The Fourth Company, led by Company Commander Cao Ying, was attached to Train No. 17, the Zhenhu train, on the 25th, arriving in Changzhou at around 10 a.m. At around 1:30 p.m., soldiers were unloading military supplies on the platform when a soldier named Yu Genhu, wearing a hand grenade, did not secure the ammunition, causing it to misfire, fall to the ground, and explode, killing him instantly. A passenger named Hua Zhushan was directly in the path of the explosion and was also killed. Passengers Sun Bohe (brother of Sun Zijing, secretary of the Second District Commissioner's Office), soldiers Sun Deshan, and road police Wang Jingjiang were injured.

<p>Cheng Zhuang, the former Chief of the Fifth District of the Water Police, followed the late Premier in the revolution for many years and has a deep understanding of the Party and the nation's history. Since taking office as the Chief of the Fifth Water District in the 20th year of the Republic, he has strived to reorganize the district, but due to salary arrears, he was unable to implement his plans. Although he knew it was difficult, he repeatedly submitted his resignation, but it was not approved until September of last year, when his resignation was finally approved on September 28th. He was ordered to hand over the district the following day. Due to the district's defense spanning hundreds of miles and the vastness of the area, he was unable to complete the handover in a hurry. Zhao Zeshao, who took over, suspected that Chen had been negligent and falsely reported to the provincial government that Chen and the accounting director, Gao Xiang, had not only embezzled public funds but were also suspected of misappropriation. The authorities, without investigating, arrested and detained Cheng Zhuang and Gao Tong. For thirteen months, they were neither interrogated nor investigated. After the reorganization of the provincial government and the arrival of Chairman Chen in the province, he learned about the case and ordered it to be transferred to the court according to law. Prosecutor Zhu of the Prosecutor's Office conducted several court investigations and found that the two were not suspected of committing a crime. According to civil law, Chen must first complete the handover. Therefore, the court approved the request of Chen and Gao to be released on bail of 30,000 yuan to complete the handover. The two were released on the 22nd. It is now known that the Prosecutor's Office has concluded its investigation and believes that Cheng and Gao are not suspected of committing a crime. Yesterday, it was decided to dismiss the case. As for Cheng's handover, Cheng and Gao are working to complete it, and there is no shortage of funds. People have been hired to create separate registers for reporting.</p>

<p>Yao Shuizhang, the editor of the Social Daily, is the son of Yao Baoxing, a clerk. He is idle and known as a jack-of-all-trades. Since printing the Social Daily, he has been causing trouble everywhere. A few days ago, he and Li Zhong, a former policeman, went to Fuzhen Temple outside the North Gate, posing as anti-smoking personnel, planting smoking paraphernalia, hoping to extort money. They were arrested by local people and monks and sent to the county. After a preliminary trial by Judge Tu Zhiping, they were ordered to be released on bail. The Dong Fuxing Restaurant bailed them out. Unexpectedly, former policeman Li Zhong and others, knowing that things were not going well, fled overnight. The restaurant, terrified, immediately sent Yao Shuizhang to the county and requested to withdraw the bail. The judge approved it. Yesterday, Yao Shuizhang was sentenced for attempted fraud, fined 40 yuan, and the crime of impersonating a public official was leniently waived.</p>

<p>In the Xihuijiao area, about two li from Shizong in the southern countryside of this city, there is a resident named Yan Huizhong, 40 years old. His assets are not abundant, and he relies on two harvests a year to make a living. On the afternoon of the 23rd of this month, at about 6 p.m., a bandit ship suddenly arrived, with more than a dozen bandits armed with guns and other weapons. They swarmed ashore and went to Yan's house and knocked on the door. Yan was having dinner and heard a commotion outside, suspecting something was wrong, so he opened the door himself. The bandits, seeing Yan, immediately pointed a gun at him, forbidding him to make any noise. They then kidnapped Yan Huizhong and took him onto the ship. Two bandits guarded the hostage on the ship, while the other bandits searched the house, taking more than a dozen pieces of clothing and three silk quilts. After the robbery, the bandits returned to their ship and headed towards Shizong.</p>

<p>To the editor: I recently read in the Zhenjiang newspapers of the 25th of this month that the land survey fees for the twenty counties north of the Yangtze River would be temporarily suspended. This is not consistent with the facts. According to the original resolution of the 613th meeting of the Provincial Government Committee on the 24th of this month, the land survey fees for the twenty counties north of the Yangtze River that have not yet been levied will be temporarily suspended. The Finance and Civil Affairs Departments and the Provincial Land Bureau will discuss the annual amount of land survey fees to be levied and report to the meeting for further discussion. This case only applies to the eleven counties of Yiwei, Gaoyou, Fengcheng, Funing, Xinghua, Siyang, Tongshan, Fengxian, Xiaoxian, Dangshan, and Muyang north of the Yangtze River that have not yet reported the start of the levy. These counties have special circumstances, and it is proposed to adjust the levy amount to alleviate the difficulties of the people. Once the departments and bureaus have discussed and decided, and the meeting has resolved, it must still be implemented. The remaining nine counties of Taixing, Huaiyin, Lianshui, Suqian, Peixian, Pixian, Suining, Donghai, and Ganyu have all reported the start of the levy at various times and have already collected a certain amount, and are not included in this category. I am afraid that the reprint is inaccurate, leading to misunderstandings. I am writing to ask your newspaper to check and include it in the letter column to make corrections. Sincerely, Jiangsu Provincial Land Bureau, November 25th.</p>

<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports: Since the Fujian Incident occurred, the Central Committee members remaining in Shanghai, except for a few passive individuals, such as Li Liejun and others, all advocated resolving this Party division through political means. Therefore, Li sent personnel to Fujian to investigate and sent a letter to Chiang Kai-shek suggesting a solution to the current situation. It is now learned that Li's representative in Shanghai waited for a ship and only left for Fujian the day before yesterday to visit Li Jishen, Chen Mingshu, and others to inquire about their true opinions on the current situation and to convey the opinions of the Central Committee members in Shanghai. As of yesterday, Li's letter to Chiang Kai-shek had not yet been answered, presumably because Li's letter had just arrived and Chiang Kai-shek still needed to consider it. Yesterday morning, someone went from Shanghai to Nanchang to meet Chiang Kai-shek. Li entrusted him to inquire about his views on the current situation and prepare to mediate the Fujian Incident. Once the opinions of both Fujian and Jiangxi arrive in Shanghai, he will convene the Central Committee members in Shanghai to discuss a solution. However, according to the reporter's observation of the situation from all sides, the future is not optimistic.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Naval Officials Gather in Shanghai <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Since the Mawei Fortress was occupied, most of the naval personnel have been unable to escape. Only Fortress Commander Li Mengbin has arrived in Sandu, and Du Xigui, the principal of the naval school there, also managed to escape and take a boat to Shanghai yesterday, scheduled to arrive today. Furthermore, Vice Admiral Li Shijia arrived in Shanghai yesterday to visit Chen Jiliang to discuss important matters. Torpedo Commander Wang Shouting also arrived in Songjiang yesterday. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Du Xigui Escapes After the Mawei Fortress and all the fortresses were occupied by Fujian forces, most of the naval personnel were unable to escape. Du Xigui, the principal of the Mawei Naval School, managed to make arrangements and, with the permission of the Fujian forces, led 140 students of the school to Shanghai on the Sanbei Company's Wanxiang Wheel the day before yesterday. The ship is scheduled to arrive at 10 a.m. today. Upon learning of Du's and the naval students' arrival in Shanghai, the commander of the First Fleet of the Naval Fleet in this port has decided to send a Jiangnan small steamship and a barge, along with 25 unarmed soldiers and one officer, to the Wanxiang Wheel at 9 a.m. today to welcome and take care of them. Of those who escaped to Shanghai this time, Du has a rented residence in Shanghai, while all the naval school students will be temporarily housed in the Naval Social Club.</p>
<p>Li Shijia Arrives in Shanghai Naval Executive Vice Minister Li Shijia went to Nanjing from Shanghai a few days ago to discuss with Minister Chen Shaokuan how to deal with the Fujian Incident. He returned to Shanghai by the Jinpu night express train the night before last, arriving at the Shanghai North Station at around 7 a.m. yesterday. After returning to his private residence, he immediately met with Political Vice Minister Chen Jiliang to discuss important matters. Yesterday was Sunday, and Chen Jiliang and Li Shijia did not go to the Naval Headquarters, but their adjutants were on duty at the Naval Headquarters as usual.</p>
<p>Wang Shouting Arrives in Songjiang Torpedo Commander Wang Shouting arrived in Songjiang on the Yongjian warship yesterday, awaiting orders to depart, or he may come to Shanghai to take on the defense of this port. Yesterday's report that the Hai'ning gunboat had arrived in Shanghai was not true, as the gunboat is still in Sandu. Gao Xianshen, the captain of the Ninghai cruiser, arrived in Shanghai yesterday, not the captain of the Hai'ning gunboat.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Zhang Yuejun Arrives in Shanghai to Discuss the Current Situation of Hubei Province's General Administration Revenue and Expenditure of Recurring Expenses Match Temporary Expenses Are Very Difficult Construction of Highways, Telephones, etc. Has Basically Been Completed Bandits Will Be Eliminated Actively Preparing for Relief Issues <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Zhang Qun, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, has been in office for nearly five months, and the province's political affairs have made considerable progress. Therefore, he went from Hubei to Jiangxi and then to Nanjing a few days ago to report the current situation of the province to the central government. Zhang also left Shanghai for a long time, so he arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing at 8 a.m. yesterday to meet with old friends in Shanghai, and decided to return to office with his family in two or three days. A Central News Agency reporter visited Zhang at his residence yesterday morning to inquire about the current situation of bandit suppression, construction, and finance in Hubei Province. He gave a very detailed explanation, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e99">Hubei Province's Finances Are Still Difficult <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Zhang said that Hubei Province's finances are still difficult because of insufficient revenue and large expenditures. In the past, the province's revenue was more than 20 million yuan, but since the province's salt tax surcharges and other revenues were sent to the central government, and because of disasters, the people have been unable to make a living. Therefore, since the 20th year of the Republic, revenue has decreased significantly, with only 6 million yuan per year. On the expenditure side, the annual cost is more than 13 million yuan. After offsetting revenue and expenditure, there is a shortfall of more than 7 million yuan. Fortunately, the central government subsidizes 200,000 yuan per month, and the General Headquarters subsidizes 400,000 yuan per month, a total of about 7.2 million yuan per year. Therefore, since the second half of last year, revenue and expenditure have been able to match. The current financial situation of the province, under the heading of recurring expenses, has no difficulties. However, temporary expenses are still difficult and need to be addressed. As for construction costs, there are only tens of thousands of yuan this year, but construction projects in the province are waiting to be carried out and funds are urgently needed. At present, this item of expenses is allocated from the national economic committee highway fee item. Zhang also said that Hubei Province's land tax revenue is still very different from that of other provinces, so Hubei people's burden is lighter than that of any other province. I will reorganize Hubei's finances by starting with cleaning up the malpractices of corruption, in order to increase revenue, and will not proceed from the perspective of opening up new sources of income, because Hubei people have suffered disasters for a long time and cannot bear any further burdens.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Measures Have Been Taken to Relieve the Rural Areas <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the progress of construction in the province, in terms of highways, a total of more than 2,000 kilometers have been completed or are about to be completed. The installation of telephones in various counties has also been completed in order. As for rural relief, (1) a farmers' bank has been established in the province to provide loans to farmers when the new crop is not yet available, and expansion has begun to popularize it throughout the province; (2) planting is being improved to increase income, such as cotton planting, which has now begun to be improved, and a special agency has been set up to manage it; (3) the food relief plan is now being implemented in accordance with the plan resolved at the Nanchang Eight Provinces and Cities Food Conference. The above three items have been handled properly, and other construction projects in the province will also be carried out separately as financial resources permit.</p>
<h3 id="e101">The Only Important Thing for Post-Bandit Areas <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>After the bandit suppression in Hubei Province, the large bandit gangs have been eliminated, but there are still scattered remnants, which are still being pursued. Therefore, the bandit disaster in the province will soon be completely resolved. More than 20 counties have been recovered in the bandit areas. In these more than 20 counties, due to years of harassment by the bandits, the people's lives have been devastated to the extreme and are in urgent need of relief. Therefore, the post-bandit area relief issue is the only important thing in the province. The post-disaster relief funds are very large, and planning is now underway separately, including (1) subsidies from the central government, (2) requesting subsidies from all sectors of society, and (3) planning through a small amount of funding, so that a small amount of funding can be accumulated to save the people in the bandit areas. Hubei Province has already established a planning agency to specialize in this matter. I am grateful for the donations from all walks of life in Shanghai. Therefore, in addition to meeting old friends, I am also representing the people of Hubei Province to thank all walks of life.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Hope that Shanghai People Will Go to Hubei to Visit <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Zhang continued, saying that the disturbance of the Red Bandits is a major disaster for the whole country. Therefore, bandit suppression work is not only the responsibility of the government, but also the responsibility of the people of the whole country. The people of the country should recognize this point, and the elimination of the Red Bandits can be expected. To make the people of the whole country understand, propaganda should be expanded, and it is hoped that the media will first promote it. The people of Hubei Province hope that representatives of various groups in Shanghai will organize a tour group to visit the bandit areas of Hubei Province to inspect the devastation of the bandit areas that have been recovered. It is especially hoped that the media will participate. If you can come, I will represent the people of Hubei Province and entertain you sincerely.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Four Provinces Sign to Reform the Provincial System <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The reporter then asked about the change of the provincial system and what progress has been made now. Zhang replied that Chiang Kai-shek previously stated that the reform of county administration is of great significance to the progress of local politics, and at this time when everything is waiting to be done, the lack of county administration funds is especially felt. Therefore, he once had the intention of saving provincial government funds to sell to help county administration. The Third Plenary Session also discussed the bill to change the provincial system. After I arrived in Hubei, I suggested to Chiang Kai-shek that the offices of the various departments of the provincial government should be consolidated to save expenses. In this way, a lot of formalities for internal and external official documents can be saved. Chiang Kai-shek immediately sent my proposal to the provinces for their opinions. It is now known that the four provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Hunan, and Gansu have signed the reply. Although the opinions vary, they all agree that the existing provincial government really needs to be researched and revised. Chiang Kai-shek has decided to wait for the replies from the provinces to arrive before approving the method and ordering them to comply. As for the county fees in Hubei Province, it has been decided that from next year, each county will increase its expenses by 300 yuan per month to facilitate construction.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Extremely Saddened by the Fujian Incident <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the central government's steps towards Fujian after the Fujian Incident, Zhang Qun, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, told a Central News Agency reporter that he was extremely saddened by the rebellion of Chen Mingshu and others in Fujian. When he passed through Jiangxi, he met Chiang Kai-shek, and he did not know the details of the military situation in Fujian. However, solving the Fujian problem cannot be achieved by empty political methods and mediation. There should be military measures. Guangdong's attitude has been very clear, and all provinces are calling for a unified denunciation. The Fujian Incident will eventually be unsustainable.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Geshi Talks About Sino-Tibetan Relations <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Guowen News Agency reported that, according to the Tibetan great virtue Geshi Duo Zunzhe, regarding the Sino-Tibetan issue, since Zhao Erfeng led troops into Tibet at the end of the Qing Dynasty, forcing the Dalai Lama to flee to India and occupying the entire territory of Tibet for more than two years, all Tibetan monks and people have launched anti-Qing campaigns, eventually driving out the Qing army and welcoming the Dalai Lama back to Tibet, restoring the previous system. The Dalai Lama then declared autonomy, and the Sino-Tibetan split began, almost impossible to resolve. Recently, domestic propaganda claims that the Dalai Lama is pro-British and anti-Chinese, which is actually a rumor fabricated by troublemakers and is not true. Although the Dalai Lama is autonomous, China still sends representatives to maintain contact. However, from the first to the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, the political system changed frequently, and not only was it impossible to thoroughly investigate Mongolia and Tibet, but also domestic affairs were not on track. After the establishment of the National Government in the 17th year of the Republic of China, attention was paid to Mongolia and Tibet. The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission was established to do its best to handle Mongolian and Tibetan affairs. The central government's friendship and love for Mongolia and Tibet can be seen from this. However, there is no progress in fact, only superficial excitement. The reason is that the central government does not understand the situation in Mongolia and Tibet, and whether the people who come from Mongolia and Tibet are qualified to handle Mongolian and Tibetan affairs, and whether the leaders of Mongolia and Tibet have considerable feelings, and what kind of relationship they have with the people. Now, some people not only do not have the above qualifications, but are also traitors and culprits in Tibet, and they cannot handle Tibetan affairs, and they do not even dare to go to Tibet. Since they cannot even go to Tibet, how can they handle Tibetan affairs? Not only can they not handle things well, but they increase the resentment. These people generally advocate sending troops to Lhasa to overthrow the Dalai Lama. However, these culprits and troublemakers do not know the stakes. If you can send troops to attack them, he will not send troops to attack you. If he wins, it doesn't matter. If he loses, then the southwestern half of China will be very dangerous. Why? They are forced to go to Liangshan and will join the British. The British have this great opportunity and will certainly send troops to help him counterattack. Do we have the ability to resist at that time? I'm afraid we can't do it. Because I know this harm and know that some people advocate using force against Tibet, I have to talk about this harm. I hope that the central government and the officials handling Mongolian and Tibetan affairs will pay special attention to these situations. If it is said that the Dalai Lama has no sincerity towards the central government, why is there an office in Nanjing? Moreover, there are representatives there. Whether the Dalai Lama is sincere or not can be seen clearly in the book. The central government often sends people to Tibet to investigate and comfort, but it does not know who is sent, (1) cannot enter Tibet because they are criminals, (2) even if they enter, they cannot meet with the Dalai Lama and civil and military officials, and the three major temples in charge of the General Administration of Khambo (3) even if they meet, the words spoken by the Dalai Lama and civil and military officials will not believe them. With these difficulties, Sino-Tibetan harmony cannot be achieved in fact. This is the mistake of the central government in employing people. Because a few years ago, I built more than a thousand bronze statues of longevity Buddhas in Peiping, 7,000 offering bowls, and hundreds of pieces of satin, which were exempted from tax by the Ministry of Finance after settlement, and transported to Hangkang, and entrusted the Living Buddha of Tibet to bring them to Tibet. This thing is used to offer the Dalai Lama, and the Living Buddhas, and the three major temples. Because I passed through India by sea and went to Lhasa, I stayed in Shanghai for a short time, and I will announce the above in detail to those who care about Tibetan affairs.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Coming to Shanghai at Great Risk <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Our department's scout, Yu Desheng, came to Shanghai this time under the direct orders of Commander-in-Chief Zhang and Commanders Wang, to report on the latest war situation at the front lines and the vicious plans of the Japanese and puppet troops. Yu departed from Dongxing Town, near the border of Heilongjiang Province, disguised as a peddler with a willow basket over his shoulder. He walked to Harbin, where he was questioned by Japanese and puppet troops several times and detained overnight. Fortunately, he was not carrying any written reports; otherwise, his life would have been in danger long ago. Security has become ten times tighter than before. Because our troops at the front are fighting hard without support, he had to come here at great risk. Yu arrived safely in Shanghai yesterday morning (that is, the day before yesterday).</p>
<h3 id="e111">Melee in Xiji <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Upon investigation, after our Commanders Wang Zhenqi and Wang Zhenfang recovered Chexing Town, they advanced victoriously to Xiji Factory. Unexpectedly, on the night of the eighth, Japanese and puppet troops arrived stealthily and launched a massive encirclement. Fortunately, our troops discovered them early and immediately issued an emergency assembly order. At that time, the enemy had already formed two layers of encirclement. Commander Wang, seeing the urgency of the situation and the danger of the entire army being wiped out, personally led the broadsword team to break through the encirclement in a melee. The enemy used machine guns to sweep and artillery to bombard. The battle lasted until dawn on the ninth, when the inner encirclement was broken. However, the outer encirclement was still very serious. They had no choice but to use melee combat to charge and fight their way out. Seeing that we were not afraid of death, the Japanese and puppet troops retreated and defended their original positions. Xiji Factory was thus recovered by us. Around 1:00 PM, after a headcount, we found that 490 of our troops were dead, including one battalion commander, one company commander, and two platoon leaders. 113 were wounded. Over 100 Japanese and puppet troops were killed by our broadswords, and 42 had their hands and feet cut off but were not dead. We captured six machine guns, two mortars, and a large number of guns and ammunition. This battle was particularly fierce, unprecedented this year. The Japanese army's fighting against our righteous army relies on their superior military supplies and adequate supplies. But when it comes to combat capability, they are far inferior to the righteous army.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Japanese Cruelty <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army stationed in Harbin held repeated meetings, ordering his troops to completely eliminate all righteous armies in the puppet territory from November 1st to December 16th. Notices were posted in public places, stating that anyone who concealed the residence of righteous armies without reporting it would be considered as having committed the same crime as the righteous armies. In areas where the righteous armies were defeated and retreated last month, countless families were slaughtered or subjected to brutal torture. This has only inspired the people to rise up and become righteous soldiers, fighting to the death against them.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Waiting for the Freeze to Launch a Joint Attack <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the weather in Jilin and Heilongjiang has been severely cold. The Songhua River and its surrounding area are covered in thin ice, but it is not yet strong enough to bear the weight of people. The plan to wait for the ice to thicken slightly, then coordinate with Sun Chaoyang and other units to launch surprise attacks across the ice and advance on various locations, is now complete. Due to military secrets, it will remain confidential for the time being.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Urgent Need for Assistance <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Our Commander-in-Chief Zhang Zhichao ordered Yu Desheng to come to Shanghai. Because the search along the way was strict, he did not use written reports but gave oral reports. He instructed me to personally go to Generals Zhu Ziqiao and Li Du's residences to report on the difficult situation at the front and request them to appeal to all sectors for urgent assistance, including cotton clothing, medicine, and other expenses. Because the current battle can be sustained temporarily, but when the severe cold comes and they have to launch ice attacks, they must have cotton clothing. Therefore, Yu Desheng's purpose in coming here is to request assistance and to instruct Zhou Fu, Wang Chuanjing, and Sun Dequan, the advisor of Sun Chaoyang, who came to Shanghai the other day, to return to their defense posts quickly to begin preparations. They also need to train dozens more broadsword teams, specializing in melee combat, to exchange blood and flesh for the recovery of our homeland, and so on.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun stated that, according to a recent statement by a certain foreigner who visited Vladivostok and came to Shanghai, the Russian military authorities have appointed Garan as the commander-in-chief of the Far Eastern Red Army, leading 300,000 troops to mobilize towards the Russian-Manchurian border. Their elite units are concentrated in Vladivostok, but their air force's bombing defense capabilities are still very weak in the event of war with Japan. The troops in Vladivostok have almost all moved to Nikolayevsk-on-Amur (Nikolayevsk). Military preparations in the northern coastal province are becoming increasingly serious. On the other hand, the air force base near the Russian-Manchurian border in the coastal province, the Spassk-Dalny airfield on the shore of Lake Khanka, is being expanded and strengthened. All facilities, such as underground airfields, hangars, and oil storage tanks, have been completely installed. The surface is covered with solid steel bars, making it absolutely safe from any bombing. The new-style airfield is connected to the Far Eastern general base of the Red Army Air Force in Irkutsk and the base in the Amur region, Bosgary, and forms a cell-like air defense network for the entire Far Eastern Russian territory for the purpose of promoting the Communist Party's propaganda policy using air force operations.</p>

<p>The Xin Xin News Agency reports that the Ministry of Railways, with the nationwide railway intermodal transport having been implemented, and the vehicles on each line being insufficient, has now ordered a large number of vehicles from the United Kingdom to be distributed to each line to develop its business. As for the vehicles ordered this time, there are four locomotives, sixteen passenger cars, twenty flatcars of forty tons each, two hundred and ten all-steel boxcars, twenty-five all-steel gondola cars, two cabooses, and one official car. The above goods have been contracted by both parties and are limited to be delivered in May next year. After the cars are transported to China, the Ministry of Railways plans to allocate one hundred all-steel boxcars to the Longhai Railway and ten to the Yuehan Railway, with the remainder being allocated to the Jinpu Railway for application.</p>

<p>Former Minister of the Navy Yang Shuzhuang, along with former acting chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government Fang Shengtao, traveled to Hunan, Hubei, and other places. They returned to Shanghai by overnight train at 7:30 yesterday morning. According to people around the two gentlemen, when the Fujian Incident broke out, Yang and others were traveling, so the situation was quite unfamiliar to them. They intend to stay in Shanghai temporarily and not travel elsewhere.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Fujian Organizations in Shanghai Issue Letter to Fellow Provincials, Saying 30 Million Will Resist the People's Government to the Death <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The Xin Xin News Agency reports that the United Federation of Overseas and Domestic Fujian Organizations in Shanghai, recently because the 19th Route Army participated in Chen Mingshu's organization of the People's Government, betraying the party and the country, specifically issued a letter to the elders and brothers of Fujian Province and overseas Chinese brothers yesterday. The original text is recorded below. Last year, the Red bandits captured our Zhangzhou. The government sent the 19th Route Army to assist. The army had not arrived, and the bandits had already retreated. When the army arrived in Fujian, Commander Chen was in Quanzhou and Zhangzhou, fearing the bandits like tigers. They dared not take a single step beyond Longyan. Our Fujian people prayed morning and night that they would recover western Fujian. During the year that the army was stationed, there was no progress of even an inch. However, we still remember their good name for resisting Japan in Shanghai during the January 28 Incident and tolerated and expected them again and again. Unexpectedly, after the army entered our Fujian, they</p>
<h3 id="e119">Coerced All Parties <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Seized the authority of pacifying the entire province, taking the opportunity to sell their vicious plan to eliminate our Fujian troops. In the past year, reductions in force were expected. The 49th Division was originally a national army, but because its division commander, Zhang Zhen, was from Fujian, he was not spared. As for Lu Xingbang's troops, they were also regarded as a thorn in the side by the army. Only because there was an emergency in northern Fujian were they able to survive. The army actually regarded our Fujian as a conquered land, turned against the host, and harbored intentions of annexation. The heads of the army still thought it was not enough, so they seized our political power and reorganized the provincial government. One army succeeded, and all their lackeys rose to power. The key positions in all departments were filled with people from Guangdong. Moreover, all national tax agencies were easily changed with a single telegram from the authorities. Officials scrambled to put on their hats and followed like dust. Our Fujian, after the chaos of war, and the withered people's livelihood, already felt</p>
<h3 id="e120">Devastated <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Since the change in the political situation, tens of thousands of families have lost their jobs. The sound of people gathering and crying shook the neighborhoods. And those Cantonese officials are complacent, drunk, and singing joyfully. The people of Fujian's fat and grease, flowing to their hometown, is said to be over a million a month in remittances from various banks and post offices. However, we still swallowed our tears, thinking that the unemployment of civil servants in the province was still a small matter, and that the suffering of 30 million compatriots needed to be relieved. We still hoped that they would clarify the laws and win back the people's hearts. However, since taking power, they have used the depletion of financial resources as an excuse to increase taxes. The number of items and the severity of the tax amount are unprecedented in the history of Fujian. Our haggard and groaning people</p>
<h3 id="e121">Endure and Donate <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>And the price they paid was the notorious butcher, Qiu Zhaochen, the head of the provincial public security bureau, killing the petition representative Zheng Weixin, and the Quanzhou garrison shooting Lin Huiyuan, the head of the Hui'an County Party Committee. These are things that everyone has heard and seen. As for the garrisons in various counties, slaughtering the people and protecting opium and gambling, the cases of crime are too numerous to describe. (There will be a special publication to announce to the whole country.) The so-called 19th Route Army, which shamelessly stole the reputation of resisting Japan, has now fully exposed its hideous face. The army authorities are acting against the tide of history and do not repent. Recently, they have colluded with rebels from all sides to organize the so-called People's Government.</p>

<p>Falsifying public opinion. Our 30 million fellow provincials should resist to the death, refuse to pay taxes, refuse to serve in the military, refuse to participate in any meetings or elections, farmers refuse to supply grain, merchants refuse to transport goods, and workers refuse to provide equipment. We must implement the spirit of non-cooperation to promote its demise. As for the overseas Chinese, they provided as much spiritual and material assistance to the army as possible during the Battle of Shanghai. Now, they are using their assets to be friendly with Japan and join the Communist Party, recognizing thieves as fathers and disturbing the hometown where overseas Chinese grew up. Is this not the same as raising children who, when they grow up, devour their parents? We should all rise up together to punish this beast. This is not only the good fortune of our Fujian but also the good fortune of the whole country. The United Federation of Overseas and Domestic Organizations in Shanghai.</p>

<p>The Guangdong Association in Shanghai issued a telegram yesterday, admonishing Chen, Li, Jiang, and Cai, saying, "Fuzhou, sent to Chen Zhenru, Li Renchao, Jiang Jingran, Cai Xianchu, all gentlemen, and all fellow provincials, all gentlemen, Outer troubles are pressing, and internal strife is breaking out suddenly. No matter the success or failure, it will all be bitter for our people. The officers and soldiers of the 19th Route Army are all brave soldiers from Guangdong. For the Cantonese to defend Fujian, Fujian and Guangdong have become one family. It is proper to use the spirit of unity to prepare for foreign affairs and to promote our reputation and eternal glory. Now, at a time of serious national crisis, they are staging the pain of internal strife. Once war starts, it will devastate the people's livelihood. When the snipe and clam fight, the fisherman benefits. You are all intelligent. How can you bear to do this? I implore you to rein in your horses at the edge of the cliff and immediately stop the war. The Northeast has already fallen. How can the country bear to be split up? You all belong to Guangdong and bear heavy responsibilities. You should preserve vitality for your hometown and plan for the country's overall security. Only then will a chronically ill husband be able to prolong his life, and the leaking boat will be able to survive the difficult times. Tears and words, I hope you will consider and accept. The Guangdong Association in Shanghai." You,</p>

<p>Fujian Nationalists, distressed by the Fujian Incident and unwilling to echo Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and others' actions of destroying the party and harming the country, have been leaving Fujian for Shanghai in droves in recent days. On the 26th, they gathered in Shanghai to discuss ways to protect the party and save the country. The results were: (1) The United Office of Fujian Nationalist Comrades was established immediately; (2) Representatives were sent to Beijing to request the central government to quickly send a large army to join the Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi national armies to carry out a punitive expedition against Chen and Li, and to urge the central government's representatives to Guangdong to depart immediately to welcome Hu Hanmin to Beijing to jointly preside over the party and the country's major plans.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Academic Organizations Prepare to Welcome Marconi, the Inventor of Radio <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The world-renowned inventor of wireless radio, Italian Marchese G. Marconi, came to visit the Far East. He recently arrived in Japan and was warmly welcomed by the government and the public. Marconi is now traveling from Japan to Liaoning and is expected to arrive in Dalian within days and then come to Shanghai. The Academia Sinica, the United Office of Shanghai Universities, the Science Society of China, the Chinese Institute of Engineers, Jiaotong University, and the Chinese Wireless Radio Engineering School have jointly launched a welcome for Marconi. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday (the 25th), at 3:00 PM, a welcome preparatory meeting was held at the Science Society of China on Avenue Albert. Attendees included Zhou Zijing (Academia Sinica), Li Zhaohuan (President of Jiaotong University, representing the United Office of Shanghai Universities), Yang Xiaoshu (Science Society of China), Xu Peihuang (Chinese Institute of Engineers), but Xu was unable to attend due to business and delegated Shi Konghuai as his representative, Zhang Tingjin (Jiaotong University), and Fang Ziwei (Chinese Wireless Radio Engineering School). After discussion, it was decided to temporarily use the Science Society of China as the temporary office of the preparatory committee, organize a committee, and agree to hold a public banquet for Marconi at Ronghong Hall of Jiaotong University. Li Zhaohuan was publicly elected as chairman and was also asked to give a scientific lecture in the auditorium. A letter was first sent to Marconi through the Italian Minister, expressing welcome. At the same time, Xu Peihuang was recommended to contact the municipal government to discuss welcome matters. Fang Ziwei inquired about Marconi's whereabouts at any time and contacted local wireless radio communication circles such as the International Radio Station and the Broadcasting Station to discuss the date of reception. It was also decided to hold a second meeting next Thursday (the 30th of this month) to discuss all aspects of the welcome. From today, any circles willing to join the welcome can contact Mr. Yang Lishu, the secretary of the association. According to the latest news, Marconi and his wife will pass through Tianjin on the 29th of this month and go to Beijing on the 30th for a short tour. After that, they will go south from Tianjin and Beijing and are expected to arrive in Shanghai around the 7th or 8th of next month.</p>

<h3 id="e127">The River Conservancy Committee Discusses Loan from Boxer Indemnity, Second Phase of River Conservancy Project Being Prepared <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The Ta Kung Pao reports that the initial project of dredging the Zhangfu Canal by the River Conservancy Committee was completed at the end of July. Navigation and irrigation have benefited greatly. The committee is now actively preparing for the second phase of the project and has discussed borrowing 9 million yuan from the Boxer Indemnity Fund for the project. The news is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Borrowing from the Boxer Indemnity Fund for the Second Phase of the River Conservancy Project. It was previously decided that the project cost would be 9 million yuan, to be allocated from the Boxer Indemnity Fund. The toll revenue collected by each lock would be used as collateral, and the interest would be paid monthly by the Ministry of Finance. However, since Minister Song resigned, the procedures could not be fulfilled. Vice Chairman Chen Guofu of the River Conservancy Committee has repeatedly negotiated with Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi and Chairman Zhu Jiahua of the Boxer Indemnity Fund. The result was quite satisfactory. The loan and repayment methods for the Boxer Indemnity Fund and various procedures have been largely agreed upon. However, the Boxer Indemnity Fund still insisted on disbursing the funds in three installments. The first installment of 4 million yuan would be disbursed on December 1st, the second installment of 3 million yuan would be disbursed on February 1st of the 23rd year, and the entire amount would be disbursed by the end of June. Chen believes that disbursing the funds in installments is feasible. However, the second phase of the River Conservancy Project is of great importance to the national economy and the people's livelihood. If the project starts and the funds are insufficient, the work will be suspended, resulting in huge losses. Therefore, Chen is now negotiating with the Boxer Indemnity Fund to request a one-time disbursement, but the Boxer Indemnity Fund has not yet agreed.</p>
<p>Second Phase of the Project. As for the second phase of the River Conservancy Project plan, it was decided to first build the Huaiyin and Shaobo locks to maintain convenient navigation and traffic. Although ships can travel between Qingjiangpu and Zhenjiang, except for the area south of Gaoyou, which can barely be passable all year round, the riverbed in the Mapengwan section north of Gaoyou is silted up. Every winter, the river freezes and dries up, making navigation inconvenient and traffic interrupted. The River Conservancy Committee dispatched engineer Wang Fengxi, along with personnel from the engineering and land departments, a few days ago to survey the lock construction site and drill soil samples and handle land acquisition procedures. All work is now being prepared, and work can begin on a scheduled date as soon as the Boxer Indemnity Funds are disbursed.</p>

<p>The China Jishanghui, four years ago, took in hundreds of orphans in Wugong, Shaanxi, and taught them skills such as weaving, carpentry, and farming. The results were remarkable. Over 300 of those who completed their studies were able to make a living on their own. There are still one or two hundred remaining. The association has been remitting funds annually for maintenance, which has been considerable. This year, due to financial difficulties, the orphanage has a considerable deficit and is almost unable to maintain operations. The director, Mr. Wang Jishi, sent a letter requesting an allocation of funds for maintenance. The association initially declined due to lack of funds and asked Director Wang to find a way to raise funds locally. Recently, they received another letter from Mr. Wang, stating that the area has been hit by continuous years of famine, and there are no wealthy gentlemen to solicit donations. As the end of the year is approaching, the situation is even more difficult. The association believes that the Wugong Orphanage has a considerable history and cannot bear to suspend operations halfway. They made an effort to raise 500 yuan and have already remitted it through Jinhuiyuan Wharf in this city to the Lu and Zhang brothers of the Shaanxi branch to be forwarded to Director Wang of Wugong for maintenance. The Shaanxi branch also sent a letter stating that the weather has recently turned cold, and disaster victims are gathering. If they are not provided with relief in this howling north wind, they will inevitably perish in ditches. They requested the Jishanghui to take charge of at least one or two gruel kitchens for relief. However, the association also lacks funds and has been unable to start operations. As the weather in Shanghai is already showing signs of severe cold, and it is snowing in Shaanxi, the disaster victims are living like years. How long can they wait? It is hoped that those who have enough to eat and wear will consider the disaster victims and generously donate to save a life, which is better than building a seven-story pagoda.</p>

<p>The following is a record of the two telegrams sent to the central government and Fujian by the Shanghai Maritime Federation and 25 other organizations on the 25th: (1) A telegram to the central government, which reads, "To the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, the National Government Executive Yuan, Upon hearing that Li Jishen, Chen Mingshu, and others colluded with the Red bandits to establish a People's Government in Fujian, the whole country is filled with hatred. The 19th Route Army has also been exploited, willingly acting as a tiger's accomplice. Their crime of betraying the party and harming the country is unforgivable. We earnestly request that the central government issue an immediate order to punish them, in order to promote justice. Our entire maritime community is willing to exert all our strength and pledge to be the rearguard. Urgent words, we ask for your consideration. The Shanghai Maritime Federation, the Chinese Maritime Officers Federation, the Nanjun'an Stevedores Federation, the Beijun'an Association, the Yan Ying General Association, the Shipping Association, the Yan Ying South Association, the Shanzheng Trade Association, the Yan Ying Tongxing Association, the New Taikoo Cargo Clerks Club, the Maritime Cargo Department Federation, the Maritime Food Industry Union, the Maritime Small Steamship Federation, the Maritime Supervisors Federation, the Maritime Xieyi Society, etc., respectfully." (2) A telegram to Chairman Jiang Guangnai of Fuzhou, which reads, "To Chairman Jiang Guangnai and Director Cai Tingkai of Fuzhou, Upon hearing the news of the Fujian Incident, the whole country is filled with anger and resentment. Recalling the Battle of Shanghai during the January 28 Incident, the 19th Route Army fought bravely against Japan and later declared that it would not participate in civil wars. The words are still ringing in our ears, the blood of the martyrs has not yet dried, and the scars of Shanghai have not yet healed. How can they break their promise, join hands with the enemy and the Communist Party, disregard the national crisis, betray the central government, and lose their minds? We only hope that you two gentlemen will be wise, assess the situation, and rein in your horses at the edge of the cliff. Otherwise, you will shake the foundation of the country and leave a bad name for ten thousand years. We do not agree with this. We offer sincere advice, hoping that you will adopt it.

<p>Du Yannan, director of the Shandong Provincial Investigation and Relief Office of the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee, reported that the 38,000 sets of cotton clothes shipped from Shanghai were insufficient for distribution. The freezing deaths of disaster victims were pitiful. For emergency relief, he has contacted the Jinan Poor People's Factory to manufacture an additional 10,000 sets of cotton clothes in order to distribute them to the disaster victims. It is said that the price is lower than manufacturing in Shanghai. The relief team of the committee issued 15,000 relief tickets and 15,000 emergency relief tickets yesterday and transported them to Jinan to be distributed by Director Du Yannan. According to news from the construction relief team of the committee yesterday, the Yellow River project was originally divided into the first district in Henan, the second district in Hebei, and the third district in Shandong. It is expected that the projects in the first and third districts can be completed this year. As for the Fenglou area in Changyuan County, Hebei, the second district, there are four breaches. The first, second, and fourth breaches have already been blocked. Only the third breach is still being worked on. It is estimated that 300 wooden stakes, 20,000 burlap sacks, 3,000 cubic meters of stones, and over 80,000 bricks have been transported to block this third breach on a large scale and allow the river water to flow eastward again.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Industry, because local levies and miscellaneous taxes are heavy, causing domestic rice and wheat to be unsalable, allowing foreign wheat and foreign rice to be imported, and the rural economy to suffer a major blow, in order to relieve rural bankruptcy, has specially formulated investigation forms for field tax and rice and wheat taxes, ordering county governments and county chambers of commerce across the country to investigate and fill them out, intending to study improvement measures. The city has received the order, which is recorded as follows: "Rice and wheat are essential food items for the people. The abundance of their harvest and the stagnation of their transportation and sales are of great importance to the national economy and the people's livelihood. It is the responsibility of the ministry to promote production to ensure sufficient food and facilitate transportation and sales to enrich the people. Now, in order to implement these measures, we have specially printed investigation forms for the production and sales of rice and wheat in each province and the field tax levied and the taxes collected, and distributed them to each county for widespread investigation, in order to understand the current state of production and sales and the advantages and disadvantages, so as to seek improvement methods. We are sending three copies of the field tax and rice and wheat tax investigation form for each county, and you must follow the items to investigate and fill them out in detail. You must mail one completed copy by registered mail to the ministry within seven days of receiving this document. Do not delay. Sincerely."</p>

However, in the past five years, 60% of raw materials for silk fabrics have been replaced by artificial silk, greatly reducing the price and use of natural silk. Silk-producing countries have been hit hard, and China's silk industry, clinging to old methods and failing to innovate, has suffered even more due to the encroachment of artificial silk. The rise of artificial silk is not only due to its low price and consistent quality but also to its extensive publicity. In the past year, the Japan Central Sericulture Association proposed that natural silk producing and selling countries unite to promote natural silk to compete with artificial silk. However, due to financial difficulties, it was not implemented. This year, Italy specially sent Dr. Golliher, a member of the Italian Parliament and President of the Silk Association, to the United States to discuss silk promotion matters. Japan also sent Dr. Imai, the president of Katakura Silk Factory, and eight others to the United States for investigation and to carry out silk promotion work. At that time, Mr. Miao Zhongxiu, director of the Silk Department of the Chinese Commodity Inspection Bureau, also represented the Shanghai Silk Factory Association and the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Silk Cocoon General Office to the United States for investigation. Mr. Miao arrived in New York, and Dr. Golliher also arrived in the United States at the same time. They then met with Mr. Ganli, the former president of the American Silk Association, and others to discuss solutions. Mr. Ganli and others then united American silk industry leaders to initiate the organization of the International Silk Association, inviting various countries to participate. Japan, Italy, France, Switzerland, and other countries expressed their approval and agreed to send representatives to join. Mr. Miao recommended Ke Guoxian, Director of the International Trade Bureau, as an honorary member of the association on behalf of China. The association formally sent a telegram of appointment. Now, Mr. Ke has received a letter from Mr. Ganli stating that the association has been officially registered in New York State, and the Japan Silk Association has also decided to first subsidize the association with 50,000 yuan, so that the grand international silk promotion work can be launched. At the same time, a remittance was received from Dr. Golliher, stating that the International Silk Conference was held in Paris on November 13th, and issues such as silk price setting, silk production standards, and silk promotion were all included in the agenda for discussion. Based on this, the major war between natural silk and artificial silk has entered a stage of close engagement, and the future of silk sales is not optimistic.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Flour Mill Association Cables Requesting Exemption from Wheat Import Tax: Reason Given is that Domestic Production is Insufficient to Meet Consumption Needs, Requiring Foreign Wheat <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>In order to protect the interests of farmers, the central government has already decided through the Legislative Yuan to levy an import tax of 1.25 gold units per 100 catties of foreign wheat and 2.5 gold units per 100 catties of foreign wheat flour, which will be announced and implemented on New Year's Day next year. However, the flour industry in this city believes that even in bumper harvest years, domestic wheat is only sufficient to meet five months of consumption. After the import tax is levied, foreign wheat can certainly be prevented from being sold inland, but factories will have no raw materials to produce flour, and the wheat-eating provinces will also face the risk of food shortages, which must be carefully considered. The Flour Mill Association yesterday convened a meeting of thirteen manufacturers in Shanghai to discuss remedial measures. After consultation, they unanimously advocated requesting the central government to exempt wheat from import tax. The following is a transcription of the association's telegram to the Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, Ministry of Finance, etc.: "To Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan, Speaker Sun of the Legislative Yuan, and Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance, Nanjing: Domestic wheat is usually harvested in May, and farmers have already finished selling their crops. The government now intends to aid rural areas, but imposing taxes at this time will not benefit farmers. If taxes must be imposed, it should be postponed until the beginning of the harvest in May next year for farmers to truly benefit. In bumper harvest years, domestic wheat can only supply flour mills for half a year. Wheat imports are a necessity. Even if a tax is imposed, it should only be a general commodity tax, 5% or at most 10% of the value, because this is a raw material to supply flour mills, not a product like foreign rice or flour being dumped. We hereby telegraphically submit this request for your consideration and approval. Respectfully, Gu Xinyi, Chairman of the Shanghai Flour Mill Association."</p>
<h3 id="e134">Taikoo Labor Strike: Officially Resolved in Guangzhou the Day Before Yesterday, All Workers of the Wusong Ship and Others Resume Work <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, the case of the British Taikoo Company expelling the midship workers of the Wusong ship has been delayed until now for eleven months. The day before yesterday, labor and management signed a settlement record at the Five Provinces Foreign Affairs Office in Guangzhou, and the labor dispute has been resolved. The following are the details obtained by the New Voice News Agency reporter:</p>
<h3 id="e135">Course of the Dispute <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Since January of this year, when the Taikoo Company forcibly expelled all 128 midship workers of the Wusong ship, the Guangzhou Seamen's Union blockaded the port of Guangzhou from June 23rd and refused to unload Taikoo's goods. It was not until October 18th that the Taikoo warehouse inventory was extracted. In August, all stevedores, midship workers, stokers, watermen, stewards, and pilots, more than 100 employees of the Foshan ship between Guangzhou and Hong Kong, also announced a strike. The Foshan ship is still moored in Kowloon Bay.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Divergent Opinions <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>After the Guangzhou seamen went on strike, the Taikoo Company repeatedly changed representatives to mediate. As a result, the workers demanded 400,000 yuan in compensation for losses, but the company failed to sympathize, making it difficult to resolve. At the same time, due to the workers' blockade of the port, the Taikoo Company abandoned the Guangzhou route in July. All seventeen ships, including the Shanghai-Guangdong routes, Xinjiang, Shandong Jinan, Yingzhou, etc., have changed their routes.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Mutual Concessions <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The Taikoo Company repeatedly asked Gan Jiehou of the Five Provinces Foreign Affairs Office in Guangdong and the manager of Jardine Matheson to mediate. Because the Hong Kong-Guangdong route is the main force of Taikoo's Nanhua class, Taikoo immediately built a new ship named New Foshan after all the workers of the Foshan ship went on strike. Its route is still between Guangzhou and Hong Kong. Taikoo first made concessions and accepted the workers' demands, but requested modifications to the overly harsh six measures proposed by the workers. The seamen also accepted the mediator's advice and gradually retreated.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Contract Signed and Resolved <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>At 2:00 PM on the 25th, a settlement record was signed at the Guangdong Five Provinces Foreign Affairs Commissioner's Office, mediated by the manager of Jardine Matheson's Guangzhou branch. The content was that the Seamen's Union's condition that Taikoo must hire workers through the Guangdong Union in the future was completely abolished. Only 128 midship workers of the Wusong ship and more than 100 of the Foshan ship were allowed to resume work, and it was guaranteed that similar incidents would not occur in the future. As for the compensation issue, the Midship Union announced it was 197,000 yuan, 25 yuan per worker. Another seamen's group said it was a total of 160,000 yuan, while rumors said it was 179,000 yuan. As to which number is accurate, the Midship Union has telegraphed Guangdong to inquire.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Workers on the Longhai Railway Fight for Work: Tonghua Ship Delayed Until Yesterday Morning, Expected to Arrive in Shanghai This Afternoon <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, after the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Longhai Railway Administration implemented combined water and land transportation, the Tonghua ship loaded the first batch of combined transportation goods at the temporary wharf of Sunjiashan, Laoyao, Haizhou. It was originally scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 22nd of this month. However, due to a dispute among the loading and unloading workers on the Longhai Railway over the wharf work, the quantity of goods loaded per ship was restricted. After the Haizhou Tax Police Corps sent police to suppress it, the Tonghua ship was delayed. It was not until late the night before that the loading was completed, and it left Laoyao at 3:00 AM yesterday morning to return to Shanghai. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai this afternoon or tomorrow morning and dock at the Jinliyuan Wharf. As for the Yushun ship, it is still loading goods.</p>

<p>According to the Dagon News Agency, the Mongolian Border Northwest Exhibition, sponsored by the Shanghai National Crisis Propaganda Group, was originally scheduled to open today.

<p>The Shanghai General Office of the Red Swastika Society recently received a letter from the Yulin-Qinchang Joint Emergency Rescue Team of the society, stating that "Since last year, when the Volunteer Army and the formal army came and went in Fuling County, local supplies have been difficult. However, the people can still live peacefully. Unexpectedly, bandits captured the city, and local vagrants took the opportunity to burn, kill, and loot, leaving ten rooms empty in every ten houses. There are still two or three thousand elderly and helpless people trapped in the city. After the bandits retreated, they had nothing to eat. Fortunately, the Methodist Episcopal Church came to Fuling to provide porridge. Just as they were in trouble, our team heard the news and immediately set off with relief funds overnight. We arrived in Fuling on the 24th of last month and saw that the living people inside and outside the city were all crying and waiting to die, and the dead were all exposed bones on the thoroughfare. The miserable situation was unbearable to witness. Our team immediately started burying the corpses and investigating the distribution of food. We buried 51 corpses inside the city and 23 corpses under Zijin Mountain, five miles away from the city. We investigated 654 disaster households, with 1,238 adults and 633 children. Each adult was given four sheng of millet, and each child was given two sheng. The elderly and orphans were given double rations. A total of 105 shi of millet were distributed. All those within ten li of the city have been investigated and distributed. Those outside ten li still need to be planned separately. However, the bandits have just retreated, and the local vitality has been greatly damaged. The people after the disaster urgently need relief. We hope that all sectors will pay close attention to this and help these helpless disaster victims." It is reported that the office has been trying to assist.</p>

<h3 id="e143">Jiangsu Provincial Government: Planning for the Jiangnan Seawall Project, Requiring 1.2 Million Yuan, Requesting Central Government to Allocate Funds for Repair <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>According to the Dagon News Agency, the Jiangsu Provincial Government believes that the Baotai-Changsong-Jiangnan Seawall, stretching for hundreds of miles, is the barrier of more than ten counties in Suzhou and Songjiang, and the lives and property of millions of people depend on this line of seawalls for protection. Any negligence will lead to unimaginable disasters. In recent years, due to national unrest and financial exhaustion, repairs have been abandoned for a long time, resulting in collapses and landslides, with frequent alarms. In order to plan for the seawall project, Construction Director Shen Baixian was sent to inspect the four counties of Baotai-Changsong. The inspection has now been completed. According to the report, the seawalls of the four counties are full of sores. If all of them are repaired, it will cost no less than ten million yuan. Considering only the most urgent projects, the 1,000-zhang Baoshan Second Spring and Three Stone project requires 500,000 yuan, and the renovation of the original project requires 120,000 yuan. The 400-zhang Taicang Second Spring and Three Stone project requires 60,000 yuan. The 400-zhang Songjiang Second Spring and Three Stone project requires 200,000 yuan, and the renovation of the original project requires 50,000 yuan. The 400-zhang Changshu Seawall Beach Protection Project requires 200,000 yuan, and the renovation of the original project requires 50,000 yuan. The total construction cost for the four counties is 1.2 million yuan, which must be raised and started within the year, otherwise it will be impossible to defend against the autumn floods next year, and the consequences will be unimaginable. However, Jiangsu Province has suffered disasters for many years, and the treasury is exhausted, making it difficult to raise this large sum of money. This project is of great importance and cannot be delayed. Therefore, Chairman Chen Guofu of Jiangsu has submitted a report to the central government, requesting that funds be allocated from the national treasury for repair. If approved, it would be a great fortune for more than ten counties along the southeastern coast.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Communications believes that radio is very useful. In recent years, it has been expanding the installation of radio stations in the country and seeking communication with foreign countries. The following is a summary of the recent domestic and foreign radio communication status:</p>
<h3 id="e157">Domestic Radio Station Survey <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>The provinces that have already established radio stations include: (Jiangsu) Shanghai, Nanjing, Chongming, Qidong; (Zhejiang) Hangzhou, Dinghai, Ningbo, Kanmen, Shengxian; (Jiangxi) Nanchang; (Henan) Zhengzhou, Luoyang; (Anhui) Wuhu, Anqing (now abolished); (Shandong) Jinan, Qingdao, Yantai, Weihaiwei; (Hubei) Hankou, Shashi, Yichang, Wuchang; (Hebei) Beiping, Tianjin; (Hunan) Changsha; (Yunnan) Kunming can be relayed to all parts of Yunnan Province and Macau; (Sichuan) Chongqing, Chengdu, Wanxian, Xuzhou, the above four stations can be relayed to the entire Sichuan Province; (Guangdong and Guangxi) Guangzhou, Shantou can be relayed to all parts of Guangdong and Guangxi Provinces; (Fujian) Fuzhou, Xiamen; (Guizhou) Guiyang can be relayed to all parts of Guizhou Province.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Border Area is Preparing for Establishment <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>As for the border provinces, such as Xinjiang, Tibet, and Qinghai, the only means of communication they currently rely on is military radio stations. The equipment for commercial radio stations is still lacking. In order to complete the national radio route plan and develop border commerce and culture, the Ministry of Communications recruited more than 20 telegraphers who were willing to serve in the border areas and sent them to Xinjiang last month to prepare everything. They have now arrived in the provincial capital of Dihua, but due to political disputes in the province, they have been unable to implement the original plan. Once the province returns to normal, they can officially communicate. Tibet and Qinghai are also actively preparing, and communication will be realized soon.</p>
<h3 id="e159">International Communication Report <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation believes that international radio communication is closely related to enhancing relations between countries and promoting commerce. Therefore, it has been actively working to establish communication with various countries. Currently, formal communication has been established with the United States, Russia, France, the Netherlands, Germany, and other countries. As for the planned Sino-British communication, the construction of the new radio station and antenna tower in Zhenru is also being completed step by step. Two transmitters ordered from Britain have arrived in Shanghai, one of which has been assembled and is ready for use. The other one is expected to arrive in Shanghai within days for installation. Formal communication is scheduled to begin on New Year's Day next year.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Establishing a Telecommunications Manufacturing Factory <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Furthermore, after the dissolution of the old Telecommunications Manufacturing Factory, the Ministry of Transportation notes that the supply of electrical materials to provinces across the country is being handled by the Electrical Machinery Manufacturing Factory of the Construction Committee. However, the output is insufficient to meet demand. The Ministry of Transportation now intends to establish a telecommunications manufacturing factory in Shanghai to remedy this situation. All plans have been finalized, and operations should begin soon once funding is secured.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Newspaper Reporters Association Holds Autumn General Meeting Yesterday; Initiates the Organization of a National General Association of Reporters; After the Meeting, a Dinner Party with a Raffle of Domestic Goods; An Unprecedented Grand Occasion with a Jovial Atmosphere <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Newspaper Reporters Association held its autumn general meeting at the Daya Building on Fuzhou Road yesterday afternoon at 4:45 PM. More than 150 reporters from various newspapers attended. Representatives from the Municipal Party Committee, the Municipal Government, and the Social Affairs Bureau were also present to provide guidance. Several important association affairs were discussed. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM, followed by a dinner party with an impromptu raffle of domestic goods. Finally, a movie was screened. The event ended around 9:00 PM in a joyful atmosphere. The grand scale of the event was unprecedented for the association. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Meeting Order: The meeting venue was set up in the east hall of the Daya Building, with the stage facing west. Above the stage hung a portrait of Sun Yat-sen and the national flag of the Kuomintang. To the left and right were the agenda and a list of staff members. The meeting began at 4:45 PM. The order of proceedings was as follows: (1) Opening of the meeting; (2) Election of two chairpersons by the general meeting; (3) All attendees stand at attention and bow three times to the national flag and Sun Yat-sen's portrait; (4) The chairperson respectfully reads Sun Yat-sen's will; (5) Three minutes of silence; (6) The chairperson delivers an opening speech; (7) Representatives from party and government organizations give instructions; (8) Reports; (9) Discussion of proposals; (10) Adjournment.</p>
<p>Meeting Staff: Presidium: Yan Duhe (jointly recommended by the supervisors and executive committee), Yu Kongwo, Qian Cangtian (jointly recommended by the executive committee); Qu Shaoyi, Jiang Zongdao (selected by the general meeting); Master of Ceremonies: Qian Hua; Secretaries: Jiang Jianhou, Sun Daosheng; Recorders: Wu Zhongyi, Yun Yiqun.</p>
<p>Chairperson's Address: After the chairpersons were elected, Qian Cangtian led the attendees in performing the proper ceremonial greetings. Then, Chairperson Yan Duhe delivered the opening speech, stating: "Our association's charter stipulates that a general meeting should be held twice a year, in spring and autumn. Since the spring general meeting, half a year has passed in an instant. Today, comrades, we gather together once again. Recalling the events of the past half-year, many feelings arise. From my personal perspective to each of you comrades, and to the entire association, there is a sense of shame. This is because the position of a newspaper reporter is closely related to the nation and society. Therefore, today, if newspaper reporters cannot contribute to the nation and society, it is due to the limitations of the environment. However, we do not shirk our responsibilities. Recalling the spring general meeting, we resolved to send a telegram to the generals in North China, urging them to strive to protect our national territory, and to express our condolences to Song Zheyuan, Guan Linzheng, and others who fought heroically against the enemy. But now, what has become of the territory of North China? We are not only humiliated by foreign powers but also facing drastic changes internally, sinking us further into a desperate situation. It is truly painful to speak of this. However, newspaper reporters take public opinion as their primary duty and serve as the voice of the people. They have a major responsibility to the nation and society and must not abandon their duties and progress due to temporary environmental constraints. This is what we should encourage each other to do. What is somewhat comforting is that the reporters of Shanghai, despite being in an unfavorable environment, can still unite and proceed on the right track. The membership of our association is also increasing daily. I hope that all members of this association will become more and more motivated, working hard despite the extremely difficult environment to fulfill the duties of a newspaper reporter."</p>
<p>Party and Government Instructions: After the chairperson delivered the opening speech, representatives from party and government organizations gave instructions: (1) Mao Yun, representative from the Municipal Party Committee, stated: "In a democratic country, sovereignty resides in the people. Only when the people pay attention to national affairs and exercise their powers can the nation and the people achieve prosperity. Therefore, education is the fundamental plan for the nation. Social education is closely related to the people and is extremely necessary. Gentlemen of this association, you bear a great responsibility. I hope that you will guide society based on the interests of the nation and the people, and especially pay attention to news concerning morals and customs, so as not to poison society. The future of the nation and society truly relies on you." (2) Zhang Yuanruo, representative from the Municipal Government, stated: "Newspaper reporters should self-discipline themselves with the words 'truth' and 'sincerity,' and uphold them consistently. Only then can they fulfill their mission in the era of enlightenment and lead society to progress day by day." (3) Zhou Hanmei, representative from the Social Affairs Bureau, stated: "The press is the leader of the people. Therefore, I hope that your association can take on the great mission of cultural movement to build a new China, so that the scattered culture can be unified."</p>
<p>Association Affairs Report: Next, Vice Chairperson Qu Shaoyi reported on association affairs, stating that at the spring general meeting, the total number of members was 199. One member died, five members withdrew, and 49 new members joined. The total number of members is now 242.

<h3 id="e163">Defense Corps and Fire Brigade Receive Plaques Commemorating the January 28th Incident Yesterday <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai South District Commercial Federation, in recognition of the Shanghai South District Defense Corps and Fire Brigade's day and night efforts during the January 28th Incident, which preserved the corner of Nanshi with great effort, and recalling the past achievements, deemed the contributions especially great. Therefore, it was decided to publicly award plaques commemorating the "January 28th Incident," one to each organization, to express their appreciation. The details of the presentation yesterday morning are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Presentation Details <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, dozens of representatives from the Shanghai South District Commercial Federation, including Gao Jianqing, Gao Ziyun, Wang Tingsheng, Chen Liangyu, Wu Qinzi, Pan Dixin, and Zhou Chengxiang, gathered at the meeting place. At around 10:00 AM, various teams belonging to the Shanghai South District Defense Corps came to welcome them with armed formations. Then, the three districts were loaded into a decorated pavilion (containing a plaque to be presented to Wang Zhuangfei, the deputy commander of the Defense Corps). They proceeded south along Zhonghua Road.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Reception and Thanks <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>First, they arrived at the headquarters of the Defense Corps and displayed the two plaques in the auditorium. Gao Jianqing, the chief representative, delivered a speech, stating that the merchants and residents of Shanghai South were able to survive the January 28th Incident thanks to the Defense Corps. In retrospect, they made great contributions, and they offer this small token to express their appreciation. On behalf of the Defense Corps, Commander Yao Mulian and Deputy Commander Wang Zhuangfei delivered speeches of thanks. Then, they took a group photo together and dispersed. Subsequently, they went to the Fire Brigade. Gao Jianqing again delivered a speech, stating that during the January 28th Incident, fires broke out frequently in Shanghai South.

<h3 id="e166">Zhengyi Society to Hold a Gathering <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>

<h3 id="e167">The Truth About the Cricket Gambling Den is Fully Exposed; The Son of a Former Premier and a Bank Manager Were Both Involved; The Five People Who Failed to Appear on Bail Will Be Summoned by the Court on a Scheduled Date <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Yongheng Bank on Ningbo Road leased its surplus rooms to Huaan Bank as a business premise. Huaan Bank's fourth floor had extra rooms, which were leased by the landlord to Lu Heshang to set up a cricket fighting gambling den. He gathered people who were into this activity and held intense competitions day and night, betting with money, with wins and losses amounting to thousands upon thousands. The matter came to the attention of the police. Last Wednesday, detectives were dispatched and arrested 77 gamblers and the person running the den on the spot. They were taken back to the police station along with the gambling tools and crickets, where they were placed on bail and detained separately. The next day, they were brought before the First Special District Local Court for interrogation and punishment, and were ordered to be released on bail. Five people failed to appear for questioning and will be summoned to the court again to investigate the details. This has already been reported in previous newspapers. Among the gamblers caught this time were descendants of officials and gentry, wealthy merchants, and magnates. Fearing that revealing their real names would not only result in a loss of face but also cause various disadvantages, they all concealed their true identities and fabricated false names. Now that most of the cases have been closed, and the matter has passed, the truth has gradually leaked out. According to insiders, two grandsons of Wang Wenshao, a former Premier in the Qing Dynasty, a nephew of Shen Jinjian, the former governor of Zhejiang Province, Chen Haiqiu, the current manager of Yongheng Bank, as well as Qiu Lao Jiu, a Mr. Ma, etc., were all among those arrested. Three or four of them were especially prominent. In addition, there were many others of a slightly lower rank. However, all of them arranged for relatives and friends to pay their bail in cash at the police station that night, without experiencing the taste of detention. The two grandsons of Wang Wenshao originally lived in Hangzhou. Upon learning that the gambling den was large in scale and the wins and losses were huge, they couldn't resist the temptation. They brought their invincible generals, which they had carefully trained, especially to Shanghai, hoping to return fully loaded with the generals' prowess. Who knew that the troops would suffer a setback, and both man and insect would be captured? Although the men were able to redeem themselves with money, the insects were confiscated by the authorities. The Wang brothers loved their insects as if they were their own lives. Suffering such a loss, they have returned to their hometown dejectedly. The five people who evaded the court appearance will continue to be summoned by the court next Thursday.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Robbers Sentenced Separately <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Detectives Shen Binkui and Huang Fugen from the Hongkou Police Station previously arrested a large number of robbers, including Zhang Jinfa, Ye Afu, and Shen Jigui and Zhang Ahong, who were sentenced in another case by the Second Special Court, a total of nine people. One handgun and 48 bullets were confiscated. Investigation revealed that from August 13th to November 1st, these people, armed and in a gang, robbed the households of Li Kunxin at No. 6 Yuezhou Road, Fan Wangshi at No. 102 North Zhejiang Road, Chen Caoshi at No. 871 Yalu Road, Yang Zhicheng of Xielong Tobacco Company at No. 763 Niuzhuang Road, Cao Zhiyi at No. 68 North Suzhou Road, and others, amounting to more than 2,500 yuan. They were sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and sentencing. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiefei presided over the Third Criminal Court and sentenced Ye Afu and Shen Jinyuan to ten years in prison, Zhang Jinbao to twelve years, Ye Rongyu to eight years, He Jifen to seven years and six months, Shen Jigui to seven years, Zhang Jinfa to five years, Zhang Ahong to four years and eight months, and Gu Genbao to six months. The number of days of detention before the sentence was determined was calculated at two days of detention equal to one day of imprisonment. The guns and bullets were confiscated. Xia Shutang, a Chinese detective from the Hongkou Police Station, previously arrested Jiang Xiaoqing, a Jiangbei native, at the Risheng Tea House on East Xihuaide Road for selling counterfeit banknotes. Fourteen five-yuan notes from the Bank of Communications, two ten-yuan notes from the Bank of China, and six five-yuan notes from the Dongshan Province were seized (altered waste notes from Zhang Zongchang's era). He was transferred to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. The other day, Judge Hua Yukui presided over the Third Criminal Court for further interrogation. Wang Tianyin, the police lawyer, stated that the accomplices could not be arrested by changing the date, and that the manufacturing organization was difficult to investigate. He presented the counterfeit banknotes for inspection, stating that these counterfeit notes were indistinguishable from genuine ones. The defendant confessed that Zhao Zhengbiao, Liu Dezhang, Lu Wenguang, and Ma Demao, who were at large, asked him to sell them on their behalf for the first time. The court appointed lawyer Zheng Wenkai to defend the defendant. After further deliberation, the defendant was returned to detention, and the sentencing was scheduled for a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Tang Zhezhi Sued for Ignoring Pawn Redemption <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Tang Zhezhi, a Guangdong native residing at No. 77 Yuqingfang, North Sichuan Road, mortgaged seven shares of China International Sugar Company stock with a face value of 70,000 yuan to Hequn Business Co., Ltd. at No. 3 Hankou Road for 52,500 yuan in May of the previous year. Hequn found out that the sugar company had not yet started operating and that the stock was worthless, so they initially refused to accept it. Tang then turned to his fellow villagers Jian Qinshi, who resided at No. 736 Niuzhuang Road, and Ma Jiling from Hangzhou, who assumed joint and several guarantee responsibility. Hequn, considering that the two guarantors had a certain status, agreed to accept the mortgage and signed a contract specifying the repayment date. However, Tang failed to redeem the mortgage as agreed when the time came, owing a principal and interest balance of more than 67,245 yuan. Hequn repeatedly demanded payment but was ignored. The guarantors also failed to fulfill their guarantee obligations. Therefore, the company retained lawyer Shen Yuesheng to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Local Court against Tang and the two guarantors, Jian and Zhu, requesting that the three defendants be ordered to jointly and severally repay the debt. The company also stated that Tang Zhezhi had no ability to repay, and that the guarantors' whereabouts were uncertain. They requested that the court order a provisional execution at the time of judgment to avoid difficulties in future executions. Judge Peng has repeatedly held court hearings to investigate the matter and has concluded the investigation. The sentence was originally scheduled to be pronounced last Saturday, but due to certain points in the case that needed further examination, the sentence was not pronounced at that time. It is said that another hearing will be scheduled for further arguments before a judgment is rendered.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Defense Corps Intercepts Kidnappers <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Chen Boying, a native of Pudong residing at No. 5 Jiderli, Caojiadu, currently works as a mechanic at the Shenxin Factory. Chen has a daughter named A'er, who is five years old. The day before yesterday morning, she was playing alone at the entrance of the house. Suddenly, a kidnapper named Gu Heshang used the lure of buying candy to kidnap A'er and flee without a trace. After his daughter disappeared, Chen searched everywhere but found nothing. Yesterday morning, the kidnapper Gu Heshang, leading the girl Chen A'er, was walking in Tushanwan, Shanghai West. He was spotted by Bi Jian, a member of the 10th Team of the Shanghai South District Defense Corps stationed there, who found his behavior suspicious. He went forward to question him. The kidnapper gave evasive answers. The team immediately took him for strict interrogation. According to his confession, his name was Gu Heshang, 31 years old, from Zhu Jiatang, Meijialongzhen South. He kidnapped the girl from Caojiadu at the house of a certain Mr. Jia. Last night, he stayed at a small inn in Baxianqiao. Today, he was entrusted to take her to the countryside, which was the truth. Based on the confession, the team immediately sent someone to search for the girl's father in Caojiadu. Chen Boying arrived, recognized her, and prepared a document to hand them over to the First Sub-station of the Sixth District of Xujiahui, which would then be transferred to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Major Fire on Huakang Road, Zhabei; More Than 50 Thatched Sheds Destroyed; Xia Sushi Suffers Burns to Shoulder and Arms <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>At 1:40 AM yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out for unknown reasons at the thatched shed home of Xia Sushi, located at No. 119 along the road at the intersection of Huakang Road and Jinling Road in Zhabei. In an instant, flames broke through the roof. Since the west end of the site was Huakang Road, the north boundary was Jinling Road, and the southeast sides were adjacent to tiled houses, the nearby shops and residents panicked when the fire started. Fortunately, Qiu Weiyue, the police officer on duty at the post, arrived quickly after hearing the alarm. He urgently telephoned the fire brigade to report the fire. Fire trucks arrived to put out the fire, and the fire was extinguished at 2:20 AM. Nearby tiled houses were spared from catching fire, but all the more than 50 thatched sheds (housing more than 100 families) were completely destroyed. Afterwards, Police Officer Qiu arrested the arson suspects Wu Futang and Xia Sushi. After taking them back to the district, Wu Futang confessed that he was 30 years old and a native of Yancheng, making a living pulling rickshaws. He did not admit to starting the fire, saying that he was at the rickshaw company when the fire broke out, so he did not know where the fire came from, and so on. Xia Sushi, on the other hand, claimed to be 44 years old, also a native of Yancheng. The fire started in her house. She was already fast asleep with her three children when she was awakened by outsiders and escaped, but it was too late to put out the fire, so her arms were burned. She then showed her right arm, which was wrapped in paper from shoulder to wrist with broken skin and exposed flesh. However, she also did not admit to starting the fire, saying that she did not know who started the fire. Everyone said that she started the fire carelessly while cooking, but it was a wrongful accusation. The interrogating official examined the confessions and, considering that the case involved a fire, ordered that she be sent to the hospital for bandaging first, and then dispatched officers to investigate and verify the facts.</p>

<p>The home of wealthy businessman Wei Tinghua, located at No. 51 Masnan Road in the French Concession, was recently robbed by shop assistant Yu Axiao (27 years old, Henglin Township, Changzhou) of silver utensils and fan ornaments worth more than 1,000 yuan, which were pawned to foreigners. When Wei discovered this and began investigating, Yu fled without a trace. Wei reported the matter to the French police and requested an investigation. Detectives Zhou Shizhang and Bao Bingquan discovered that Yu had fled back to his hometown. They reported this to the police chief, who in turn requested the court to prepare a document and dispatch it to the Wu County Public Security Bureau in Changzhou, requesting their assistance in arresting Yu. Yu was arrested and transferred to Shanghai. He was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court the day before yesterday morning. Lawyer Yuan Jiahuang from the police station presented the case, stating that the police station had not yet investigated the case or recovered the stolen goods. He requested that the defendant be detained temporarily and that the case be investigated and brought to trial at a later date. Detective Bao then reported the process of arresting the defendant. Judge Wu Fanglian verified the report, briefly questioned the defendant, and then ordered the defendant to be returned to detention and questioned again on the 29th.</p>

<p>Tongmaoxiang Tobacco and Paper Shop, located at No. 46 on the front side of the West New Bridge in the French Concession, has recently been mixing smuggled, counterfeit Zhongnan and Fairy cigarettes with their retail sales. This was discovered by the French Concession Investigation Office of the Tobacco and Cigarette Unified Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance. The day before yesterday, West Detective U Yau led detectives Zhou Baosheng and Zhao Chengen to the shop to search. They seized 620 Zhongnan brand cigarettes and 600 fake Fairy brand cigarettes. They then brought the manager, Zhang Zhongming (25 years old, local), to the police station and transferred him to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. Judge Wu Fanglian interrogated him. Lawyer Gu Shouxu from the police station first presented the case, filing charges based on the Regulations on the Collection of Unified Tax on Tobacco and Cigarettes and the Regulations on Penalties for Smuggling. He also presented the cigarettes as evidence. The defendant Zhang Zhongming confessed that a broker brought the cigarettes to sell, 1,400 Zhongnan brand cigarettes and 2,000 Fairy brand cigarettes. He dared to sell them because he did not know they were smuggled goods. After examining the confession, the court immediately pronounced its verdict, fining Zhang Zhongming 30 yuan for selling smuggled cigarettes and confiscating the smuggled cigarettes seized.</p>

<p>Zhou Yusun, a native of Shaoxing, 30 years old, residing at No. 320 Hartung Road, was a peddler. Recently, due to a shortage of capital, he stopped doing business. The night before last, he rented a room at the Ping'an Small Hotel at No. 253 at the intersection of Pingjili Road and Lafayette Road in the French Concession. The next morning, the tea boy Chen Shuangfu (35 years old, native of Suzhou) knocked on the door to urge Zhou to get up, but there was no response after calling for a long time. He tried to open the door and went inside to check. He found that Zhou had already died in bed. He reported the matter to the French police, who dispatched officers to investigate. The cause of death was unclear, and there were no family members. The body was immediately transported to the mortuary of the Tongren Fuyuan branch. The Second Special Court was notified the same day, and the coroner determined that the deceased died of illness. He ordered the body to be handed over to Tongren Fuyuan Hall for photography and burial. Later, the deceased's younger brother, Zhou Yangsheng, learned of the death, rushed to the scene, signed a statement, and took the body away for coffining and burial.</p>

She has served as the director of the Women's Department and other positions in the society. She was 81 years old. She was usually in good health. She caught a cold a few days ago and died suddenly the day before yesterday morning. The Guangdong community in Shanghai all expressed regret. At 8:00 AM yesterday morning, the body was placed in a coffin at the Guangzhao Hospital on Haining Road. Many people attended. The funeral procession left at 1:00 PM in the afternoon to the Xinguangzhao Mountain Villa in Dachang.

<p>Inn Industry Forms Trade Association</p>
<p>Mid- to upper-class hotels and inns in the French Concession have never had a trade association organization.

The Shanghai Municipal Government, through Mayor Wu Tiecheng, has sent letters to various hotels, urging them to unite quickly and organize a trade association. Therefore, industry leaders are now actively preparing to organize a trade association and are seeking consent separately.</p>

<p>The Effectiveness of Myriad Response Traumatic Injury Medicine</p>
<p>The Myriad Response Traumatic Injury Medicine was originally a secret recipe passed down in the Xu family of Yanguan, specializing in the treatment of traumatic injuries, old and new internal injuries. Over the years, it has cured no fewer than ten thousand people. Previously, at Xu's residence, No. 42 Hengchang Lane, south end of Beile Road, French Concession, the medicine was piously compounded to benefit the world, and no money was charged. People from far and near sought it in endless succession. All who were treated with it recovered quickly. It is generally regarded as the only sacred medicine in the trauma department. Because there is still an overwhelming demand for the medicine, whether by letter or in person, a fee is now charged to cover the cost of the medicine. Hereafter, those who seek the medicine at the Xu residence will be charged 20 cents per dose, with a minimum purchase of five doses, as a form of restriction.</p>

<h3 id="e188">Starting Next Semester, Middle Schools in Other Provinces and Jiangsu Province Will Waive Tuition and Accommodation Fees. Additional Education Fees Will Be Collected Starting This Winter. Schools Will Continue to Charge Fees as Usual This Semester <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>In order to reduce the burden on students and provide relief to impoverished children, enabling them to receive secondary education free of charge, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has resolved to waive tuition and accommodation fees for all provincial middle schools throughout the province. The provincial government has ordered all counties to implement this measure starting in the next semester of this year. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Amount of Reduction</p>
<p>The tuition, accommodation, and other fees collected by provincial secondary schools throughout Jiangsu Province amount to a total of 200,000 yuan per year. The Jiangsu Provincial Education Budget allocates this 200,000 yuan annually as administrative revenue to cover regular expenses. Since the Jiangsu Provincial Government passed the resolution to waive tuition and accommodation fees for all secondary schools throughout the province, the school administrative fee income item in the education budget will be reduced by 200,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Method of Compensation</p>
<p>The method of compensation is to add 20 cents to each stone of grain in the provincial tax revenue. The annual grain tax in Jiangsu Province is approximately 1.5 million stones. Due to crop failures and defaults by the people, it is not possible to collect the full amount uniformly. After discounts, each stone is calculated at 20 cents, which can yield 200,000 yuan to compensate for the waived tuition and accommodation fees.</p>
<p>Source of Grain Tax</p>
<p>The grain tax method was first established by the Advisory Bureau in the Xinhai year. In the first year of the Republic of China, the Provincial Assembly resolved that the grain tax would be 5 yuan per stone, divided into provincial and county taxes, with the province receiving 4 yuan and the county receiving 1 yuan. For silver, the tax was 2 yuan and 5 cents per tael, with the province receiving 1 yuan and 75 cents and the county receiving 30 cents. Since the establishment of the Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office, the education fees have been separated. Of the 4 yuan provincial tax per stone of grain, the Finance Department collects 2 yuan and 6 dimes, and the education fees collect 1 yuan and 4 dimes. Of the 1 yuan and 75 cents provincial tax per tael of silver, the Finance Department collects 1 yuan and 28 cents, and the education fees collect 47 cents.</p>
<p>Winter Grain Tax Collection</p>
<p>Since the Jiangsu Provincial Government passed the resolution to compensate for the waived tuition and accommodation fees for secondary schools, starting with the collection of this year's grain tax, of the 4 yuan provincial tax per stone of grain, the Finance Department will collect 2 yuan and 4 dimes, a decrease of 2 dimes compared to before, and the education fees will collect 1 yuan and 6 dimes, an increase of 2 dimes compared to before. Although the education fees for grain have increased by 2 dimes per stone, the actual burden on the people has not increased at all. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has repeatedly ordered all counties to remit 2 dimes per stone for education fees starting with this year's grain tax.</p>
<p>Waiver of Tuition and Accommodation</p>
<p>The waiver of tuition and accommodation fees for all provincial secondary schools throughout the province will be implemented uniformly starting in the next semester of this year (i.e., next spring). This semester, because the grain taxes are just beginning to be collected, the schools will continue to charge fees as usual in the autumn. This measure is entirely to provide relief to impoverished children throughout the province and enable them to receive secondary education free of charge.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Order Issued by the Jiangsu Provincial Education Department: Amended Measures for Collecting Student Fees in Provincial Middle Schools. Provisional Measures for Awarding and Assisting Impoverished Students Also Amended and Promulgated. <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Education Department issued a general order regarding the waiver of accommodation fees for provincial middle schools in the next semester: It has been found that the measures for collecting student fees in provincial secondary schools were previously formulated by this department and circulated for implementation, and have been followed for many years. Now that the Provincial Government Committee has resolved to waive tuition and accommodation fees for all provincial schools starting in the second semester of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, other fees such as library and physical education fees should also be re-established based on the regulations of the Ministry of Education and considering the students' family economic burden and assessment methods. All previously established measures for collecting student fees in secondary schools have been revised separately. In addition to submitting them to the Provincial Government for review and record, and requesting the Ministry of Education to file for record, the revised measures are also issued separately to the principals of the schools, ordering them to comply with the revised measures for collecting student fees from the second semester of the 22nd year of the Republic of China and to ensure strict compliance. This order... Amended Provisional Measures for Collecting Student Fees in Jiangsu Provincial Secondary Schools.</p>
<p>Article 1: Provincial secondary schools shall strictly comply with these measures when collecting student fees.</p>
<p>Article 2: The student fees collected by provincial secondary schools each semester are specified separately as follows: (1) Physical Education Fee: Middle schools and vocational schools shall charge 1 to 2 yuan per student per semester; normal school students are exempt.

<p>Yesterday (Sunday) afternoon at 3:00 PM, Donghua and Western Police played the first week of the Group A round-robin match at Yiyuan Stadium. Donghua was the champion of the previous season. This encounter with the fiercely combative Western Police naturally attracted many fans. Looking at the overall situation, the moments of brilliance were evident. Donghua was not diminished by the absence of three injured key players from last week's match against Youyou. Zhou Guangzhong, Shen Guanlan from Jiaotong University, and Yu Shunzhang from Fudan University joined to assist. The coordination was satisfactory. Therefore, in a dramatic match, thanks to the efforts of the players, a tie was achieved. There were more than 6,000 spectators. In the last two minutes, Lu Zhongen was penalized and sent off for arguing with the referee.</p>
<p>Donghua Team:</p>
<p>Lu Zhongen</p>
<p>Feng Yunyou Guan Xun'an</p>
<p>Tu Kaiyuan Shen Guanlan Wu Youliang</p>
<p>Wan Xianghua Zhou Guangzhong Yu Shunzhang Chen Hongguang Jia Youliang</p>
<p>Western Police Team:</p>

<p>Turner Hughes</p>
<p>Heresh Xu Fales</p>
<p>Wogensheng De Fei Sheng Lijieke Bote</p>
<h3 id="e202">Starting the Competition <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>Three bells rang, and Donghua arrived first and tested their footwork. Then, Western Police also arrived. Referee Bot blew his whistle, and Western Police chose the field. Donghua kicked off first, but the ball was intercepted by Zha Xu and sent to the front. The five Western Police forwards fiercely attacked the goal. Several offsides were in vain. After about ten minutes, Chen Hongguang got the ball and made a long pass. Jia Youliang had a one-on-one opportunity to directly attack the enemy's line, but the ball was blocked and kicked out by the Western Police goalkeeper. Donghua's midfielder Shen Guanlan assisted in all directions and was generally satisfactory. Jia Youliang had two corner kicks, and Wan Xianghua made several passes, all of which were well-placed, but unfortunately, there was no one to shoot, and the opportunities were missed.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Dangerous Moments <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>After thirty minutes, the area in front of the Donghua goal was full of enemy figures. Fortunately, Feng and Guan consolidated their defense. In addition, Lu Zhongen caught the high ball and kicked it out to defuse the danger. At forty minutes, Western Police's Turner fouled thirty yards to the left of the goal. Wu Youliang took the free kick, and Yu Shunzhang made a beautiful shot, but it went through the crossbar and missed, which was a great pity. Zha Xu snatched the ball from the middle and sent it high to the right corner. The ball was already out of bounds, but the referee missed it. Fortunately, it was saved by Feng Yunyou. The first half ended, and both sides had achieved nothing.</p>
<h3 id="e204">After Lemon Time <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>After switching sides, both sides fought even harder due to their eagerness to win, and their actions were somewhat rough. Donghua's goalkeeper Lu Zhongen was penalized for walking four steps with the ball (commonly known as "shooting the fence"). De Fei lofted the ball over the crossbar. With the crisis gone, Donghua's forwards bravely charged into the Western Police territory, like a surging tide. Fales blocked too eagerly, resulting in an injury, but he recovered quickly. Shen Guanlan made a long pass to Wan Xianghua. Wan curved the ball from the sideline in front of the Western Police goal. Zhou Guangzhong calmly flicked the ball into the goal, opening the scoring. Donghua took the lead with one goal.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Returning the Goal <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>After losing this goal, the Western Police all paled in comparison. They quickly rallied and made a vigorous counterattack. Lu Zhongen was overwhelmed. Finally, De Fei scored a goal, tying the score. The difference between the two goals was only five or six minutes. Donghua then sent troops from the border, but the Western Police goalkeeper saved the ball from the crowd. Heresh passed to Bote, who made a solo run but missed. In the forty-third minute, Lu Zhongen was dismissed from the field by the referee for arguing with the referee about corner kicks and out-of-bounds balls. Tu Kaiyuan substituted him. Fortunately, time had run out. Ah Tu kicked the ball once, and the game ended in a 1-1 draw.</p>

<p>Qiangdong and Liangliang are the two outstanding teams in the Shanghai Women's Basketball Group B. They met last night in a crucial match for the championship. Both teams were fully focused on competing. The five hundred and ten female spectators who came to appreciate the game were also very excited, cheering and shouting to support their respective teams. After the contest, Liangliang started strong but then faded, while Qiangdong continued their efforts, turning defeat into victory, winning with a score of 34-21, and winning the Group B Women's Basketball Championship. In another game, Guanghua and Shangzhong showed improved skills day by day and gave a good performance. As a result, Guanghua won with a score of 32-15. The details of the Qiangdong and Liangliang game are recorded below.</p>
<p>Liangliang Takes the Lead: The two teams lined up, and Liangliang's three forwards immediately launched a fierce attack. Zhu Hefeng, with the support of her teammates, was like a phoenix soaring in the sky. Qiangdong struggled to gain momentum, relying only on Xu Wenying's free throw for one point. Afterwards, Liangliang continued to dominate. Although Qiangdong was unwilling to be outdone, they were relatively less effective. In the first quarter, Liangliang led with 9-4.</p>
<p>Tied Score: After a brief break, the game resumed. The Qiangdong ladies were greatly encouraged and determined to fight to the death. They worked hard to attack, but still struggled to score, while Zhu and Li scored one after another, taking a commanding lead with 15-4. At this point, the audience was disappointed with Qiangdong. However, the players on the field were not discouraged and calmly responded. Xu Wenying and Xue Jinghua worked well together, and the score gradually narrowed. As the first half ended, Xu's center shot from the left corner, creating a 16-16 tie.</p>
<p>Comeback: After a ten-minute break, the competition resumed. Both teams struggled even harder in this tense situation. Miss Xue scored a basket in the paint, taking the lead. Xu Wenying's free throws were successful, further advancing their progress. The Liangliang players were in a state of collapse, blocking fiercely and committing frequent fouls, causing the defenders to tremble. This gave Qiangdong an opportunity to attack. At the end of the third quarter, Qiangdong took the lead with 26-18.</p>
<p>Qiangdong Wins the Championship: In the fourth quarter, Qiangdong took advantage of their momentum and became more powerful. Xu Wenying, like a butterfly flitting among flowers, scored three consecutive baskets. Knowing that the situation was critical, the Liangliang players fought bravely to the death, but their eagerness to win led to recklessness, resulting in a complete collapse. As time ran out, Qiangdong won with a score of 34-21, winning the championship.</p>

<h3 id="e209">International Triangular Track and Field Meet; Baihong Wins the Championship; Second Place to Russian Community, Third Place to Japanese Community; Next Session Scheduled for April Next Year <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>The international track and field competition between the Baihong, Russian Community, and Japanese Community groups continued yesterday with three events: discus throw, triple jump, and distance relay. The Japanese Community won two events, while Baihong only won the discus throw. Chen Baoqiu's score of 34.03 meters was quite good. In the overall score, Baihong won the championship with 90 points, the Russian Community was second with 52 points, and the Japanese Community was third with 43 points. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Discus Throw <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>The participants included three from the Japanese Community, three from the Russian Community, and two from Baihong. Chen Tieniu did not bring his spiked shoes and wore long pants and leather shoes. He threw the discus casually and surprisingly well. He threw over 30 meters on his first attempt. By his third attempt, he spun and threw 34.03 meters. After that, he did not dare to exert himself due to a hand injury, and could not make further progress. Biao and Guangtian were eliminated in the preliminary round. Glashan had a tall stature, but unfortunately, his throwing technique was not good, and he fell to second place. Japan's Takahashi and Russia's Brokov did not exceed 30 meters. First place: Chen Baoqiu (Baihong), 34.03 meters; Second place: Brokov (Russian Community), 33.72 meters; Third place: Glirim (Russian Community), 31.85 meters; Fourth place: Fu Baolu (Baihong), 31.13 meters.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Triple Jump <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>Xiao Dinghua, who had not participated in the triple jump for a long time, happily took the field yesterday to boost the team's morale. As expected, the veteran was a classic and not easily eliminated. He jumped 12.82 meters on his first jump, only 16 centimeters short of Komatsu. On his second jump, Komatsu showed his colors, and the measurement result was 13.43 meters. Lao Xiao made slight progress until his sixth jump. The results were the same as Brokov. The final decision (one more jump) was that Komatsu was slightly better. First place: Komatsu (Japanese Community), 13.43 meters; Second place: Xiao Dinghua (Baihong), 12.88 meters; Third place: Deguchi (Japanese Community), 12.26 meters; Fourth place: Brokov (Russian Community), 12.26 meters.</p>

<p>First leg, 200 meters: Chen Baolin started in an excellent position, but at 120 meters, Japan's Okamoto overtook Bao Lin by one step and passed the baton. Second leg, 400 meters: Liu Fukang tried to catch up with Japan's Nagashi, but his leg cramped after entering the turn, and Nagashi still caught up. Third leg: Wu Zijing ran swiftly with the baton, competing fiercely with Japan's Nishinai. At 700 meters, Nishinai could not hold on, but Russia's Gu De阔夫 started to chase from 20 meters behind, showing great potential to catch up. Fourth leg, 200 meters: Xue Jianqiu relied on a quick baton exchange and took the lead all the way to the finish line. The time was 4 minutes and 3 seconds. Russia's Da Lie夫chen阔 closely followed, but fell behind by one shoulder. Japan's third runner collapsed at the finish line, and the situation was over. The track yesterday was 300 meters per lap.</p>

<h3 id="e221">The Reasons for the Flourishing of Banking Business in Shanghai by Wei Youfei <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>I.</p>
<p>In the past two years, there has been a clear trend in Shanghai, which is the flourishing of the banking business. It goes without saying that Beijing Road and Ningbo Road are regarded as the Wall Street of Shanghai. Even areas such as Sichuan Road and Xinzha Road to the north, Jing'an Temple Road to the west, and the area around Eight Immortals Bridge all show a tendency for banks to be everywhere. Is this phenomenon due to an overabundance of financial capital, or is it an urgent need of the commercial society?</p>
<p>The newly established banks generally have small capital, with a maximum of 500,000 to 1 million yuan. Their power is not strong, and their business items are largely similar. The establishment of so many banks, reflecting the current market situation, will naturally make people wonder if their business focus will tend to conflict. This is the motivation for this article.</p>
<p>The reason for the flourishing of the banking business in Shanghai, simply put, is the concentration of floating capital in Shanghai. Because Shanghai is a city, a special city. Since the government established its capital in Nanjing, its economic position has become increasingly important. Import and export transactions must go through Shanghai, funds must come to Shanghai, the focus of securities is on Shanghai, the market price of exchange is on Shanghai, and the executives of the mint and the central bank are still in Shanghai. This alone makes it the forefront of the concentration of banking businesses. If we analyze the reasons for the concentration of floating capital, then:</p>
<p>Agricultural reasons: wealth originates from industry and agriculture. China is an agricultural country, with the agricultural population accounting for 80% of the total population. The majority of these farmers rely on agricultural products to maintain their livelihoods. Years of famine have led to rural bankruptcy, increasing the number of unemployed in rural areas and endangering rural security. The bourgeoisie, who have always lived in the countryside, are not only seeing a decline in their wealth due to the decline of the countryside, but also fear for the safety of their property. Moreover, as problems arise in public security, government and military expenditures must increase. Due to the remote location of rural areas, the burden on these limited assets of the bourgeoisie is bound to increase. On the income side, it is declining; on the expenditure side, there is a growing trend. This is an important reason for driving the bourgeoisie away from the countryside and into the Shanghai group. Moving to Shanghai not only allows them to avoid the heavy and choose the light, but also, because of Shanghai's special circumstances, their wealth and lives can be worry-free. The continuation of this situation will further promote the decline of the countryside, making the two sides extremely divergent.</p>
<p>Industrial reasons: China has no real industry. Everything is struggling under the aggression of capitalist imperialism. The so-called national industries, silk factories and cotton mills, are all in a state of distress. Even the raw materials they use are almost entirely dependent on others. In recent years, the decline of the countryside and the reduction of agricultural products have caused pain to both farmers and industry. The farmer produces, and the industrialist consumes. Because of the difficulty of making a living, the general purchasing power is low. Coupled with the layers of exploitation by the capitalist powers nearby, self-operated factories are doomed once they suffer misfortune. Because of the blows to industry, capitalists, who were originally going to devote themselves to industrial advancement, now, in view of the situation, have to turn this capital into floating capital. Bankruptcies occur, and those who have not yet gone bankrupt, seeing the reality, stop their efforts. As a result, finance becomes stagnant. Since the beginning of this year, the daily market interest rate has been hovering between 5 and 6%, which is enough to show that the movement of funds is directionless, which is rare in the past.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>How is this floating capital used? It is impossible to open factories. As for running businesses, the widespread famine and banditry make most merchants frown. While they wait for opportunities, they want to place their funds in a place where they can be active. At the same time, they want to maintain their position as business leaders and expand their influence. Only running financial businesses can meet these two conditions.</p>
<p>The powers of shareholders in stores and companies are limited, and there are fewer people who can manage them. As for old-fashioned stores, shareholders have no direct way to increase their status. Therefore, only financial businesses have these two characteristics. When funds are needed, they can find ways to borrow from their own banks, on the one hand to generate interest, and on the other hand to prevent the funds from stagnating. Moreover, at the same time, the potential growth of financial power is the backing of business and reputation.</p>
<p>There are two ways to run a financial business: one is to run a native bank, and the other is to run a modern bank. However, running a native bank is more difficult than running a modern bank. The reason is easy to explain. Native banks are old-fashioned organizations, and shareholders have unlimited liability, which is a heavy responsibility, while the shareholders' powers are small. This is one reason. Secondly, the shareholders of a native bank must have real strength as a backing, especially during periods of financial alert, the strength of the shareholders is needed to cope with the situation. As such, the shares of native bank shareholders cannot be too fragmented. Usually, there are only ten shares, and the number of shareholders is at most four or five. These four or five people must not only have substantial assets and reputation, but also have a kind of "turning around" ability. Therefore, being a shareholder of a native bank is easy to become burdened for capitalists. Banks are not like this. Several hundred yuan per shareholder, combined with many small shareholders, makes the position of the major shareholders particularly solid. Major shareholders of banks have a greater hope of being appointed as directors, which can give them a strong influence. If they see that the market is good, they can further develop their own strengths and engage in a certain business. If funds are insufficient, they can turn to their own bank for turnover, which is probably more fluid than before the bank was opened. Therefore, native banks are a collection of large entrepreneurs, while banks are a combination of many small entrepreneurs to support and develop a large enterprise.</p>
<p>At this time, using floating capital to run a bank is a way for capitalists to find a way out for their capital. Their own position can of course be increased, they can also obtain considerable profits, and they can also place many unemployed people. It is indeed the most appropriate way to deal with the situation.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>From the above, given that the reality of the economic society is in this form, from where do financial businesses extract their profits? The biggest goal of financial businesses is to take in funds and use them. The usual principle is to make loans. However, in the current situation, industry and commerce need loans, but financial businesses are wary and dare not take risks lightly, thus creating a stalemate. There are two ways out for the banking industry in Shanghai:</p>
<p>The first is to operate in public debt. When the state is in financial distress, it often uses issuing public debt as the only way out. We know that the interest on public debt is more generous than ordinary loans, and we also know that the issuer of public debt is the government, and its payment of principal and interest is guaranteed, which is enough to reassure the general financial capitalists. This is especially better than ordinary loans. Therefore, the government uses this as a way to plan government affairs, and banks also use this as the only method of investment. Banking businesses are also afraid that the profits will not be widespread, so they collect fragmented deposits and operate in public debt in bulk. The bank benefits on one side, and the government loses on the other. The source of government finance is the people, so the bank's profits are secretly taken from the people. Industrial and commercial businesses that actually need loans do not receive any real benefits. This is a distorted development, which is not conducive to the future of enterprises.</p>
<p>The second is to operate in real estate. When the countryside goes bankrupt, the wealthy and floating capital all gather in Shanghai by coincidence. The population of foreign residents tends to increase, and the population of the concessions expands, thus promoting the soaring of land prices in Shanghai. Moreover, due to the competition among capitalists, the momentum of land price increases is accelerated. Financial businesses use this point to engage in the purchase of real estate in addition to focusing on public debt. Due to the banks' frantic purchases, the rise in real estate accelerates, and financial capitalists are able to sit back and enjoy the profits during this soaring period. Financial capitalists collect deposits in small amounts from depositors, increase their capital strength, and are able to implement their large-scale profit-making plans.</p>
<p>Merchants naturally aim to make profits, and financial businesses cannot find a way out outside of merchants. However, the biggest goal of financial capitalists is definitely not to increase their own profits, and their source comes from the use of distorted exploitation. Their main business relies on the fact that both the government and the people are in a disadvantageous position, and the financial capitalists' strength in underwriting public debt is so strong that they can often look down on everything. The latter is especially enough to make financial turnover inflexible, leading to a stagnant situation. When will our financial capitalists be able to turn to the right path?</p>
<h3 id="e222">Women's Savings and National Economy by Li Junsi <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>Today, the fierce competition in the banking industry is an undeniable fact. They spare no effort in attracting deposits, with many different names and all sorts of tricks. For example, education savings, old-age savings, children's savings, etc., as well as increasing interest rates, priority savings, and various advertisements are all methods of attracting deposits. In all fairness, if this kind of competition is purely business competition and does not contain any elements of mutual exclusion, slander, or jealousy, then the bank will deliberately improve and strive to serve the society because of competition, and the society can also use it freely and obtain a lot of convenience. However, if we carefully observe the banking industry, we can find a shortcoming, that is, banks lack sufficient promotion of women's savings, and opportunities to serve women are still rare. If we say that there are 400 million compatriots in our country, then 200 million of them are female compatriots. Taking a step back, we assume that only a portion of the 200 million female compatriots are in a privileged position and have the ability to save, then every little helps, and these countless weak funds gathered together can become a strong new force, making a great contribution to the real economy. Who can say that this effect is weak! Unfortunately, the banking industry in our country has not taken this into consideration.</p>
<p>According to the usual situation, in today's male-centered society, women's occupations are still in their infancy. Most women are still managing household affairs and relying on their husbands' supplies. However, women's ability to save is not lacking. Undoubtedly, every woman is the manager of every family. She has the authority to control the family economy and is endowed with the special privilege of managing the family finances. In the daily family expenses, if she saves a little bit, then it is very easy to save up. And the husband always gives his wife some money every month, and women mostly cherish money very much and are reluctant to spend it. In this situation, it can be seen that women's savings power is indeed very rich. As for some women who are engaged in occupations, needless to say, they have a considerable income every month, and they do not bear much economic responsibility in the family, so their savings power is even stronger. However, banks not only lack promotion of women's savings, but also rarely have equipment suitable for women's savings. The underdevelopment of women's savings has created two phenomena in society: one is the extreme consumer, that is, the so-called modern woman. In their minds, there is no concept of saving, only vanity occupies their hearts, so their clothing, decorations, and gestures are all extravagant, so consumption, simply put, is extravagant, which is of course to be expected. The other is the absolute conservative. They lack sufficient knowledge of investment, and they have a skeptical attitude towards banks and are a little distrustful, thinking that hiding it themselves is the most appropriate way to dispose of their private savings. Among women, most are conservative, but there are also not a few who are open-minded. Strictly speaking, the former is certainly fostering the social custom of extravagance and increasing social consumption. Although consumption is also production, it reduces the national economic power. The latter puts useful funds into prison, preventing them from circulating in society. In terms of industry and commerce, it invisibly reduces an economic power. In short, both are major obstacles on the path of developing the national economy. Therefore, from the standpoint of the bank, it should make every effort to promote thrift and savings to consumers, and inform them that savings are not only related to the happiness of an individual's life, but also a responsibility that every citizen should fulfill. Because the bank has the mission of promoting thrift and changing the social custom of extravagance, it should also vigorously persuade conservatives to make them deeply understand what kind of financial service the bank is providing to the society, and to put their savings into the bank. Undoubtedly, this kind of persuasion is also an obligation that the bank should fulfill. However, most of the current banks are deluded by the immediate small profits, and ignore their great mission. Therefore, we feel that the underdevelopment of women's savings, in addition to the fact that most women do not approach banks, the banks themselves cannot escape the blame.</p>
<p>In the future, the banking industry should not ignore women's savings any more. In addition to allocating a portion of its resources to engage in publicity work, within the possible range, banks should set up a women's savings department and employ female tellers to specialize in this matter in order to get closer to the general public of women. In this way, most women will naturally be willing to interact with banks, and the further development of bank business is also an inevitable trend. We want to believe that after the development of women's savings, it will be very easy to use this fund to help most women who lack the ability to save and make them produce the ability to save as well. Furthermore, to revitalize industry and help the countryside, why not declare it? Therefore, in the years when the level of national economy is declining and social phenomena are abnormal, banks should shift their gaze and pay considerable attention to women's savings.</p>
<h3 id="e223">A Comprehensive View of the Economic Panic by Chen Honggen <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>(1) Introduction. "Panic" is a modern term, a byproduct of the Industrial Revolution, and has only been noticed since the 19th century. Because of China's industrial backwardness, no one cared about it in the past. However, in recent years, domestic industries have developed considerably. According to the results of various surveys, the number of workers is as follows:</p>
<p>Agricultural workers...87,218,000 (Shen Bao Yearbook)</p>
<p>Factory workers...1,445,000 (China Labor Yearbook)</p>
<p>Miners...2,289,000 (Torgasheff)</p>
<p>Transportation workers...129,073 (Ministry of Railways, Ministry of Communications, etc.)</p>
<p>Handicraft workers...2,850,000 (China Labor Yearbook)</p>
<p>Total: 93,931,073</p>
<p>Based on this, the number of workers in our country is also quite considerable. Once production loses its adjustment, its impact on people's livelihoods will be enormous. Moreover, since the world panic in 1929, a widespread state of unemployment has been created, and our country has also been significantly affected. The study of the panic problem cannot be delayed. However, the content of the panic is complex and complicated, and cannot be fully explained in a few words. Various countries have written special books on it. Limited by space, this article can only make a general statement on the causes, development steps, impact, and relief policies of the panic.</p>
<p>(2) The Cause of the Panic. The reason for the panic is the imbalance between production and consumption. Since the introduction of machine production, the factory system has emerged, adopting precise division of labor and using large amounts of capital, raw materials, and labor to produce large quantities of goods. Can this large quantity of goods be confirmed to meet the needs of society? The answer is not necessarily. Producers often do not understand the market situation and often guess. As a result, production and consumption gradually become separated, and the amount of production often exceeds or falls short of the amount of social consumption. The former will inevitably lead to overproduction, while the latter will form low consumption power (UnderConsumption). As a result, prices will inevitably fall, commodities will be in a state of stagnation, credit will be destroyed, and finance will be in chaos. The entire economic society will be disturbed, and panic will be formed.</p>
<p>(3) The Nature of the Panic and the Procedure of Development. (1) Nature. Panic has two special characteristics: (A) Cyclicality... A panic occurs approximately every ten years. This is indeed a strange thing. Some interpreters believe that it is due to the action of sunspots, or that it is caused by the circulation of credit. However, since 1870, the interval has changed slightly, either seven years or five years, but there is no doubt that it has cyclicality. (B) Intermittent Severity (Double Population)... Panic has another important characteristic that is easily overlooked, that is, every time it occurs, a severe one will occur. An "X" in the table below indicates a severe panic, especially the one in 1929, which was unprecedented:</p>
<p>X 1818 1825</p>
<p>X 1837 1847</p>
<p>X 1857 X 1873</p>
<p>1884 X 1893</p>
<p>1903 X 1907</p>
<p>1920 X 1929 (Most Severe)</p>
<p>(2) Development Procedure. The occurrence of panic has its specific steps, which can be roughly divided into four periods!</p>
<p>(A) Prosperity Period. Before the panic occurs, the economic society will show a lively phenomenon. First, prices increase due to a surge in demand, and new enterprises will inevitably emerge. Old enterprises, tempted by high profits, will also expand greatly, and everyone will embrace an optimistic attitude. During this era, the need for labor will also increase. Because of the need for capital, the credit system will inevitably develop, and interest rates will inevitably exceed the horizontal line. (B) Financial Panic Period. As mentioned earlier, the stability of the economic society depends entirely on its ability to maintain a balanced development. However, since prices are expensive, production enterprises have expanded greatly, and cash has been absorbed by producers. The circulation of currency will inevitably be insufficient. In order to expand capital or increase currency, various banks or companies absorb deposits or issue banknotes excessively. Once a run on the bank or a withdrawal event occurs, and the bank or company cannot cope, it will inevitably lead to the closure of its business, forming a currency panic (Monetory Crisis). (The bankruptcy of John Cook &amp; Co in the United States in 1873 and KnickerBocker &amp; Co in 1907 can be used as examples.) Although producers are willing to continue to absorb capital, investors rush to recover capital, so production enterprises will inevitably stagnate, and prices will fall day by day. (D) Severe Panic Period. Once prices have fallen, and producers are unable to absorb capital as a remedy, the result will inevitably be factory closures. Once factories have been closed, the capital previously used for production will enter a state of rest and be flooded in the market, and its interest rates will turn to lower. (C) Revival Era. After production enterprises have been shut down, the quantity of goods will inevitably decrease day by day, and the needs of society cannot be reduced with it. With a small amount of goods to supply a large amount of demand, their prices will gradually rise. Entrepreneurs, seeing that there are profits to be made, will invest again. This cycle repeats itself, completing a panic cycle.</p>
<p>(4) The Change of Prices and the Panic. The basic cause of the panic is overproduction, and its external manifestation is through the rise and fall of prices. Therefore, to understand the dynamic state of the panic, we must first study the procedure of price changes in detail. According to the facts, the rise and fall of various prices do not necessarily occur at the same time, and their degree and main materials vary. The procedure is listed below:</p>
<p>(A) Government bonds, stocks, etc... This type of price is the most sensitive, and any slight stimulation or change from the outside will be expressed. For example, during the war last year, the price of government bonds soared as soon as it was relatively peaceful, and fell immediately once it was tense. (B) Wholesale Prices. The speed of their rise and fall is also very large. For example, if external demand increases slightly, their price will rise, and vice versa. (C) Retail Prices. Their speed is not as fast as wholesale prices, because their relationship with prices is more indirect. (D) Wages. Their rise and fall depend entirely on wholesale and retail prices (the reason will be explained later). (E) Long-term Contracts. This type of rise and fall is extremely slow, because it is limited by time (such as rent, land rent, etc.).</p>
<p>(5) The Relationship Between Panic and Unemployment. What is the relationship between panic and unemployment? It is not difficult for us to obtain it from the procedure of price changes in the previous section, which is briefly described below:</p>
<p>(A) Period of Rising Prices. According to the above procedure, producers benefit first when prices rise, and retail prices then rise. The cost of living for workers will inevitably increase, and their inherent wages will not be able to cover expenses, and they will further demand an increase. Because they can make profits, capitalists are also happy to share part of the profits to increase the remuneration of workers. Therefore, both labor and capital have benefits during this period. (B) Period of Falling Prices. When prices fall, wholesale prices bear the brunt, so capitalists suffer first, followed by a fall in retail prices, and a fall in wages follows retail prices. At first glance, this procedure seems to be quite beneficial to workers, as they can enjoy cheap goods. However, this advantage is only temporary, because capitalists have no profit to make, they will inevitably stop their production business, and workers will become unemployed. Therefore, a fall in prices also symbolizes a premonition of unemployment, and overproduction is the main cause of falling prices and panic. The relationship between panic and unemployment can be seen from this.</p>
<p>(6) The Relief of Panic. The relief of panic can be observed from two aspects: one is to formulate general relief laws, and the other is to establish rescue measures for panic unemployment.</p>
<p>(A) General Relief Measures. (1) Laissez-faire Policy. The theories of optimistic economists and Adam Smith can also be used to relieve panic, because the nature of the panic is cyclical, similar to the operation of celestial bodies, which cannot be changed by human power. Furthermore, in terms of human nature, once prices fall, producers will automatically stop production, and prices will inevitably rise again after a long time. Furthermore, those with sharp eyes can take precautions in advance. Therefore, panic is actually a kind of natural elimination, which is necessary and indispensable. However, according to the facts, the arrival of panic causes the wise and the foolish to perish together, indiscriminately. Moreover, panic is only temporary. If this short period of misfortune can be avoided, wouldn't it be of great benefit to mankind? Therefore, this method cannot be considered good. (2) Control and Limit Production Enterprises. The main cause of panic is overproduction, so it is appropriate to restrain it in a negative way, promote the Cartel movement, avoid competition and conflict between enterprises, and then it can be agreed upon prices, share profits equally, and distribute sales routes without leading to a phenomenon of surplus. (3) Encourage Consumption. On the one hand, panic is due to overproduction, but on the other hand, it is due to low consumption capacity, so we should try to increase the people's consumption capacity. The methods are nothing more than (A) reducing prices, (B) paying prices in installments, and (C) promoting cooperative consumption, etc. (4) Increase import duties on foreign goods and implement dumping policies at home and abroad. The former can reduce the source of goods, and the latter can give domestic goods the opportunity to sell well. (5) Set the price of currency. The expansion of production depends on a large amount of currency. With the abundance of currency, producers can borrow at low interest rates to expand their production. At the same time, the expansion of credit currency also has the danger of disrupting finance. Therefore, it is appropriate to limit the amount of currency in circulation to increase interest rates, so that production enterprises will not expand excessively, and panic will also be reduced.</p>
<p>(B) Relief Measures for Panic Unemployment. (1) Determine the Production Plan. Capitalists should first consider the steps of their production, so that they can develop in an average way, so as to avoid concentrating in a certain period, resulting in overproduction in that period, which will lead to labor unemployment in the later period. (2) Shorten Working Hours. One effect is that workers will not suffer from idleness or overwork, and the other is that unemployed workers will also have the opportunity to work. For example, in the past, a worker worked twelve hours a day, while at the same time, a worker had no work to do. If we now order the former to work seven hours, then the latter can also get considerable work. (3) Improve Vocational Education. So that workers can adapt to a variety of jobs, even if a certain production business is shut down due to overproduction, they can still participate in other production businesses. (4) Organize Well-Functioning Employment Agencies. To seek a way out for unemployed workers, this business is not very developed in our country. The 20th National Congress passed a worker unemployment relief bill, one of which was to establish employment agencies in various cities. Later, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce also promulgated regulations on employment agencies. The employment agencies that have been established now are in Nanjing, Peiping, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, Qingdao, Guangzhou, Jinan and other places. (5) Charitable Business. Subsidies for unemployed workers. (6) Unemployment Insurance. This system originated in the city of Ghent in Belgium. Therefore, it is named Ghent System. It has been promoted in various countries since then, and it has been quite effective. It once declined during the war, but it has developed greatly again after the war. This system has not yet been implemented extensively in our country, and the government should vigorously promote it.</p>
<p>The above is a general description of the relationship of the panic. Since the recent economic depression, the world has been panicked and at a loss. If we can carefully analyze it, we will naturally be able to find its clues and it will not be difficult to provide relief. The Technocracy School of Economics in the United States is aimed at preventing panic and rationalizing production. If their theory can be implemented, wouldn't it be the greatest happiness for mankind?</p>
<h3 id="e224">Letter from Readers <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>Dear Sir/Madam, I read the article "Relief for Rural Bankruptcy and the Pawnshop Industry" by Xie Ejun in the Economics Weekly on page 5 of your newspaper on the 13th. It describes the current rural situation in great detail, and I deeply admire it. However, there are three points that are slightly different from the facts regarding our bank's plan to set up an agricultural warehouse in Qingyang, Jiangyin. Please correct them to avoid doubts in all circles. (1) Name. According to the iron peasants, they originally relied on pawnshops to pledge items to borrow funds for turnover. Last year, pawnshops closed down, and the peasants' economy had no way to circulate. Therefore, the local party and government agencies and local people jointly applied to our bank to go to the pawnshop site to run a warehouse, which was named "Qingchang Shangji Agricultural Warehouse," not an item mortgage office. (2) Types of Collateral. According to local customs, the bulk of the mortgage is food and cloth. Our bank only accepts these two types as the standard, and other clothing items are not mortgaged. This type of mortgage is only to facilitate the peasants' temporary economy and retain the opportunity to wait for the price to sell out, so as to avoid the loss of the low price at that time. Therefore, there is no need for an excessively long period of six months, and it is not an imitation of the Shanghai small pawnshop method. (3) Interest Rate. Our bank stipulates that the maximum is one point, plus an insurance fee of four points for the warehouse rent, totaling one point and four mills, not one point and six mills. The above three points should be included in the "Letter from Readers" column, so that readers can understand the development of the Qingyang Shangji Agricultural Warehouse, and I will be very grateful. Sincerely yours, Agricultural Cooperation Loan Department of Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank.</p>

<h3 id="e226">Securities: Last Week's Bond Market in a Storm; The Minbian Crisis Was Serious, and Many Bulls Fled; The Market Result Was Unanimously Like a Waterfall <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>Last week, from November 20th to 25th, the market at the China Commercial Securities Exchange was stormy and violent, even more so than the previous week. The Minbian Crisis had moved from serious to burst, which was the first act of the Minbian Crisis. The subsequent situation will depend on whether the Guizhou and Guangxi provinces support it, whether the central Guangdong province assists the central government in suppressing Fujian, whether the war is inevitable, and its location, and whether welcoming Hu can be achieved. All kinds of situations are enough to sway the rise and fall of the government bond market. The situation is unusually complicated, and the news is also changing rapidly, which is the second act. At present, it is still in the brewing period of the second act, and there are many changes in the future. However, with the central government's military strength and the current isolated situation in Fujian, it should not be difficult to quell it immediately. The government bond market, which has been shocked by this, has a future like a boat sailing in a huge wave, and its panic is inevitable. Last week, due to busy trading every day, only three rounds were done. On Monday, the situation in Fujian suddenly became serious, and it was known that the burst could not be avoided. Large households sold out one after another. Although the 11th slightly covered the short position, it was already a drop in the bucket. Market prices fell sharply by several dimes to one yuan and three dimes. On Tuesday, the Minbian Crisis actually broke out and declared independence. Large households sold out, and retail bulls came out of the cage, which was even more panic. Market prices plummeted, and most had already found new low prices, which were about one yuan less to two yuan and three or four dimes compared to the previous day. However, at the close of the market, the surface had slightly seen short covering. On Wednesday, the new changes in the Minbian Crisis and the central government's severe handling of it, and Guangdong Province's cooperation with the central government, the market price suddenly rebounded, and the rebound was very strong. Large households such as the 47th and 54th bought in, and the total increase was several dimes to one yuan and two or three dimes. Jinzhang rose sharply by two yuan, which was the rebound at the end of the first act of the Minbian Crisis. On Thursday, the first round inherited the rise of the previous day, and the remaining momentum was still strong, rising another half yuan or so. After that, rumors arose again, and it became tired again, and there was still no vigor. On Friday, rumors about the Minbian Crisis were rampant again, and the bulls came out of the cage, and those who changed positions were extremely eager. Market prices fell sharply again, and many varieties saw low prices again, mostly about one yuan or so and one yuan and eight dimes. Saturday was the last day of this month's futures. At first, the situation was slightly settled due to Guangdong's use of troops against Fujian. In the first and second rounds, there was a rebound. In the afternoon, the news was bad again, and it turned down again. The trend was that Guangdong Province had no intention of sending troops, and Zhejiang Province became serious again, and the future was still difficult to be optimistic. After a week, the market was swaying in the wind and rain, stormy and turbulent, and changing rapidly. The market price results were unanimously leading to a fall of one yuan and several dimes to more than three yuan. The spot demobilization fell by as much as four yuan and nine dimes. The total number of transactions was 150.2 million yuan. The results of its rise and fall are listed in the table on the left:</p>

<p>New York, November 24th, New York telegraphed the cotton market situation for the week, saying that the spot cotton market this week was mixed, and transactions were limited. A small amount of arbitrage sales were absorbed by the industry. In addition, transactions were limited to some squaring and the advance liquidation of the December period. The currency debate has disturbed the popularity of speculators and shaken the trust in the gold purchase plan. Because of the belief in the expansion theory, some of the buyers who bought in have now liquidated, which is probably the reason. Japanese merchants bought in when prices fell. According to Washington news, farmers in the South who hold term cotton contracts will soon be able to receive 4 points per pound of惜款. As a result, 200,000 to 400,000 bales of cotton were handed over to cotton farmers to pay part of the cotton field rent, so that there would not be pressure to sell in large quantities at a price of less than one dime per pound.</p>

<p>— Xiao Diren</p>
<p>Little friends! Isn't our body more important than anything else? Yes, right? Then, how should we protect it? Now, children in Soviet Russia have very good ways to protect their own bodies. They do not exercise their bodies through sports, nor do they take tonics to nourish their bodies. What they do are things we usually don't pay attention to! Now, I will translate them and introduce them below:</p>
<p>(1) Don't eat cigarettes, alcohol, and chili peppers; (2) Don't eat rotten food.</p>
<p>(3) Don't drink raw water; (4) Don't put your fingers in your mouth.</p>
<p>(5) Don't urinate or defecate indiscriminately; (6) Don't spit carelessly.</p>
<p>(7) Don't masturbate; (8) Don't rub your eyes with your fingers.</p>
<p>(9) Don't eat food sold in the open air; (10) Don't put urine buckets in the bedroom.</p>
<p>(1) The house must be cleaned; (2) Brush your teeth and bathe every day.</p>
<p>(3) Change clothes often; (4) Often [trim] nails.</p>
<p>(5) Kill mosquitoes; (6) Kill flies.</p>
<p>(7) Keep the windows of the house open; (8) Always wash your hands clean.</p>
<p>(9) Clean public places; (10) Practice getting up early.</p>
<p>There are a total of twenty items here, divided into ten "Don'ts" and ten "Musts". Therefore, they collectively call this the Ten "Don'ts" and Ten "Musts" Body Protection Exercise.</p>
<p>Little friends! This is very beneficial to our bodies, learn it!</p>

<p>— Yan Gou</p>
<p>I went to the countryside to attend a wedding banquet. Although it wasn't "three days before and four days after", it lasted for four days. The first day is called "Xia Zhuo" (lower table). Originally, it meant that the pork, lamb, chicken, and duck needed for the wedding day, and the leftovers that were not elegant, such as the internal organs and offal, were eaten by relatives on the day before. Therefore, it is called Xia Zhuo. But now it's different. The dishes served are more abundant and better than on the wedding day. On the wedding day, there is no need to say much. Naturally, all three meals are big pieces of meat, big fish, and big bowls of wine. The next day is "Nuan Fang" (warming the bridal chamber). The guests give a gift and ask for several miscellaneous things, making noise for most of the night. This meal is similar to Xia Zhuo, or even better. The fourth day is thanking the accountant. Although it is not a large-scale invitation, close relatives and friends are also included. Therefore, eating is the most important issue for a wedding. There are even cases where the guests are unhappy because the host is stingy, the hospitality is inadequate, or the supply is insufficient, which shows the importance of eating.</p>
<p>Originally, since Suiren (a legendary figure who invented fire) had the troubles of music and marriage, eating was indispensable. However, this kind of eating is not beneficial to either side. On the host's side, a lot of money is spent. On the guest's side, sudden overeating may be harmful to the body. However, people generally believe that this is necessary to show its grandness. The more people eat, the bigger the face; the better the dishes, the wider the scene. Even the newly married bride must prepare more festive fruits to deal with the embarrassment of making fun of the bridal chamber. It is often heard that the guests are criticizing the bride's inadequacy, as if missing a handful of melon seeds or a cigarette would be a major flaw in the bride. "The people regard food as heaven." This can be seen here!</p>
<p>Eating a little more at a wedding banquet is still a happy thing, but having to eat for two or three days at a funeral is even more extravagant and inappropriate. I often go to funerals, pay my respects a few times, have a meal, wipe my mouth, and leave, and I don't even understand what's going on. But many families holding funerals are worried that not enough people are eating, and only a few tables are sitting sparsely in a large hall, which is quite unsightly.</p>

<p>"Chinese people should use Chinese goods"</p>
<p>A large slogan caught Mr. Zhang's eye in a startling way.</p>
<p>"Of course, this is a national duty," Mr. Zhang thought.</p>
<p>"Ah!" Mr. Zhang thought, "This shop assistant is so muddled. This is Shanghai, not the three northeastern provinces, I'm afraid no one would be willing to run on the street wearing purple calico trousers and a jacket."</p>
<p>"This year is the Year of National Goods, we are especially offering discounts. Sir, please make do and try it, we will slowly improve," the shop assistant used his means of attracting customers.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang, after all, was conquered by the clever business acumen, and took a bolt of Du cloth back. At the same time, he also brought back a question: "Why not teach 'goods to accommodate people' and instead 'people go to accommodate goods'?"</p>
<p>When leaving the market, the large slogan "Chinese people should use Chinese goods" once again caught Mr. Zhang's eye. Mr. Zhang suddenly understood!</p>
<p>1. In a shoe store</p>
<p>"My leather shoes are old, I should buy a pair. But where are the national leather shoes?"</p>
<p>Peeking and looking around, Mr. Zhang searched for shoe stores all over the street. "These are British leather, I don't want them. These are Japanese goods, I don't want them. I want to buy a pair of genuine Chinese leather shoes." Mr. Zhang requested this in a shoe store. "Yes, yes, purely Chinese leather shoes, but the style is a bit worse." The shop assistant busily found a pair of black leather shoes for Mr. Zhang.</p>
<p>"Are these Chinese goods? Why are they so ugly, how much?" After repeated scrutiny, Mr. Zhang reluctantly asked the price. "Four yuan and eighty cents," the shop assistant murmured. "Don't dislike them for being ugly, they are sturdy goods," he added.</p>
<p>"Isn't the British leather one written as four yuan and twenty cents? Why is the rough cowhide one more expensive?"</p>
<p>"This is a national product," the shop assistant said carefully, bringing a mysterious smile.</p>
<p>"Don't you have any better ones?"</p>
<p>"This is the best national product, if you want better, unless it's smuggled goods."</p>
<p>"Alright! I have no choice but to make do," Mr. Zhang paid the price of four yuan and eighty cents in "making do".</p>
<p>2. In the National Cloth Market</p>
<p>"Sir, this is famous Du cloth made from Chinese raw materials and Chinese manufacturing. Would you like to buy some?"</p>
<p>"Isn't this purple calico? Are there other colors? The width is also too narrow."</p>
<p>"Sir, this is the most popular national cloth sold in the three northeastern provinces, very strong..."</p>

<p>Chapter 19: Desiring to leave yet not, they recall past events in the same car; Half crying, half laughing, she leans on the pillow in a sick and decaying autumn</p>
<p>While he was hesitating, Ji Zhi could see his expression, so he said: There is a waiting room inside, shall we go there to sit and talk? Guizhi stopped, stared at his face for a while, blinked her eyelids, and then smiled slightly; Where is Second Master going? Ji Zhi said; Naturally to Haidian. The two spoke. He had already walked into the waiting room. Because it was still early, there was no one in the room, Guizhi didn't know why, but her face turned red again. Walking to the door of the room, she hesitated for a while, acting as if she wanted to enter but didn't. Ji Zhi first sat on a long chair, seeing Guizhi's hesitant look, he also stood up, smiled faintly and said; It doesn't matter. This waiting room does not distinguish between men and women, everyone is waiting for the train here. Guizhi thought to herself that if she didn't go in, it would make Ji Zhi look bad, so she walked in generously and sat down. Ji Zhi slowly took out a cigarette and matches from his body, slowly smoked it, and slowly puffed out two mouthfuls of smoke, without making a sound. Guizhi sat there, pulling at her clothes, and coughed a few times, before sitting down again. After Ji Zhi puffed out a few mouthfuls of smoke, he thought of a key sentence. He laughed and said; Miss, we are not as familiar as we were before as neighbors, now we are much more estranged. Guizhi smiled, but did not answer his words. Ji Zhi said; Friends are like this, being together every day, feelings will naturally get better. If we don't see each other for a long time, even good feelings will be lost. Guizhi smiled and said; The feelings of friends are always the feelings of friends, seeing each other every day is just like that, not seeing each other for ten years is just like that. Ji Zhi said; That's right, seeing each other every day is just like that, but thinking about the past, it seems that our feelings are more than just those of friends. When he said this, he glanced at Guizhi, to see what her expression was like? (250)</p>

<p>— Zhu Lu</p>
<p>In the few days after the Beginning of Winter, I suffered from overwork, and in terms of work, although I worked hard, it was impossible to not seek merit, and even seeking to avoid fault was impossible. Therefore, I couldn't help but feel pain in my spirit. In addition, at this time, lake crabs were on the market, full of fat and yellow, just right, I indulged my appetite, but it caused the old symptoms of coughing up blood. When I was seventeen years old, I had coughed up blood once, and later, when Yu'er died prematurely, it happened again. However, both times I only coughed up a few mouthfuls, slept for a few days, and took some medicines such as "Yijingcao", and it gradually stopped. This time, however, it was particularly fierce. Every day, I coughed up a full teacup of fresh blood. The traditional Chinese medicine decoctions were ineffective, and the Western medicine skin needles were ineffective even after two injections. For two consecutive days, I coughed up four cups of fresh blood. At that time, my wife was so frightened that she lost her soul. I also couldn't help but feel terrified. Death, for my body that has suffered so much, if I were to die in one breath, it would be a great relief. However, as a poor couple with no savings, I had to stand up and work hard every day. If I didn't work for a day, problems would arise. Although blood was being coughed up cup by cup, my mind was still very clear. Looking at the bright red blood, various thoughts arose. Thinking about the future, thinking about the various possibilities after death, it was unbearable to imagine. Fortunately, on the third day, a Western medicine intravenous injection caused me to break out in a hot sweat all over my body, and the bleeding stopped. However, after three days without eating, my ears were ringing and I was dizzy, and I was exhausted.</p>
<p>I am an unemployed person, relying on my pen for a living, month after month of hard work. I use the manuscript fees written by my pen to maintain the family expenses of two people; so it is also miserable, usually wearing cloth clothes and eating simple meals, I already feel very difficult. My family's living expenses are measured according to income, so I always try my best to save money wherever possible; clothing is not to be discussed, and in terms of diet, I also try my best to economize, but after this coughing up blood, for the sake of nourishment, I eat cod liver oil, chicken essence, eggs, soy milk, etc. every day. In terms of dishes, I also eat pig trotters and fatty ducks, enjoying a good appetite, restoring the enjoyment of a young master. But a low-ranking scholar actually enjoying the good fortune of a rich man is too humorous. But the doctor instructed me to obey strongly, and I could only temporarily ignore the economic problems of the future. "Cod liver oil" is said to be the most effective for nourishing lung diseases. However, pure cod liver oil is so fishy and oily that I can't eat it with my poor appetite. Milky white cod liver oil is also not easy to eat. The cod liver oil I eat is malt essence cod liver oil. However, in the domestic Dali brand malt essence cod liver oil, that layer of pure cod liver oil still floats on the malt essence, and the fishy and oily smell still exists. "Halibut Cod Liver Oil," the taste is delicious, but a bottle of cod liver oil costs three yuan and forty cents, which can only be eaten for half a month. For me, who has economic difficulties, I really want to eat it but can't afford it. After this coughing up blood, my dear friend Mr. Cheng Xiaoqing taught me a method of self-made malt essence cod liver oil. The method is very easy, and the value is particularly cheap. Although the taste is not as good as "Halibut", it is much better than Dali brand cod liver oil. I dare not keep it a secret, so I write it to tell my fellow sufferers.</p>
<p>The method is very easy. First, take two-thirds of malt essence (ie, maltose, commonly known as pure sugar). Add half a portion of clear water and cook over a gentle fire for twenty minutes. While the sugar is boiling, use a stick to mix the water, and then pour it into another container; let it cool for five minutes first, and then pour in one-third of the cod liver oil, and stir evenly as much as possible. You must wait until the sugar is solidified and cooled before stopping. When it is made, add some fruit essence, and the cod liver oil will be fragrant and delicious. To put it bluntly, this method is very easy, but there is a small trick, that is, when adding cod liver oil, you must wait for the sugar to cool for five minutes before adding it; otherwise, if you pour it in while it is hot, no matter how you stir it, the oil will float on top, and the sugar will settle at the bottom, and it will never mix well. Moreover, this self-made cod liver oil, five pounds of pure cod liver oil, plus ten pounds of malt essence, and two pounds of clear water, can make a full seventeen pounds of malt essence cod liver oil, and its value is only about four yuan, which is really cheaper than any tonic!</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou Shoujuan heard that I was coughing up blood and came to see me, and also passed on a prescription. That prescription was passed down from Mr. Xie Pengfei, a friend in Shanghai. It is said to be very effective in treating lung diseases, and the procedure is also very simple. The method is: first take a section of old lotus root, cut off the lid, add 70% rock sugar to the lotus root holes, put the lid back on, and bury it vertically in rice. After a week, then take out the lotus root, at that time the lotus root will be cooked softly, and the rock sugar in the lotus root holes will also be turned into sugar juice, pour it out and drink it, the sweet taste with a fragrance is indeed very delicious. However, the lower end of the lotus root must keep the lotus root node, otherwise the sugar juice will seep out. I was very grateful to many friends for taking care of me during this coughing up blood, and I would like to thank them here first.</p>

<p>— Wang Qizhang</p>
<p>Let's get back to the topic. Now let's talk about the Tuberculosis Prevention Association initiated by Mayor Wu and others. This undertaking is no small matter. In Europe and America, they spend millions upon millions of dollars on such undertakings every year. Now, in our country, which is so financially strapped, how should we start? Here are my personal views. I believe that the first step should be to start with social education and publicity. Why? Because the government is only a guide and planner for health undertakings. When it comes to the quality of actual work, it is definitely beyond the capabilities of a few officials and a small number of technical personnel. It is also necessary to rely on the cooperation of the people. Whether the people can cooperate is definitely not something that can be restrained by laws and punishments. Therefore, the inculcation of basic health knowledge is to enable the people to understand the truth of this kind of work and to happily cooperate. Then, the measures and facilities will easily achieve twice the result with half the effort. For example, cleaning the streets is an important part of municipal work. Now, the sanitation work in Shanghai is not considered unsuccessful. However, people with brains will certainly not desecrate the clean streets. However, trash, urine, feces, paper, vegetable peels, etc. are still thrown and scattered everywhere along the walls and corners. Not desecrating the middle of the road may be due to fear of the law and fear of police intervention and fines. However, in their hearts, they are still a hundred times dissatisfied. I am afraid they will also blame the authorities for being meddlesome. We feel that this kind of incomplete sanitation work and prevention undertaking is just a perfunctory and deceptive ending. We feel that it is too uneconomical. However, the work is already overwhelming. All this is due to the lack of common sense of hygiene among the people. Therefore, I feel that tuberculosis prevention is the most important thing at the moment. It is the educational publicity work of the members.</p>
<p>Although the spread of tuberculosis does not choose classes, the poor, that is, the proletariat, are relatively more difficult to prevent. Because sanitation and disease prevention facilities are often related to economic strength. Therefore, the proper improvement and disposal of clothing, food, housing, and even appropriate treatment is easier for the propertied class. However, for the problem of common sense, the national conditions of our country are different. According to the usual practice of various countries, education must be based on assets. The proletariat is ignorant and weak because they have no education fees. Above the middle class, none are exempt from higher education. Therefore, the propertied class can be said to be the intellectual class. In our China, children's education is not taken seriously. There are families with very rich assets, but their families, even if they are illiterate, are ignorant. Perhaps because of doting, they are not allowed to go to school. Perhaps because of comfort, they are unwilling to study. Sons of Jing Shu are everywhere. In addition, there is also the education they have received, which is still a relic of the closed era, filled with old knowledge restricted by old ideas, and unable to absorb some fresh air. If you say he hasn't received education, he does chew on words and know "Zhi Hu Zhe Ye". Picking up a pen, he can write thousands of words without difficulty. Even those who call themselves doctors, who talk about metaphysics, are like this. In fact, their thinking is outdated and they have no world view or modern common sense. However, they cannot but be listed among the intellectual class and the propertied class. Such people are everywhere. Often Zheng and Shen mix up music and often Zheng and Shen mix up music. This is the most likely to ruin things. Confucius said, "Village elder, the thief of virtue," is a deeply hateful and painful saying. We should also try to save them. Therefore, social education and publicity work, under our current social circumstances, must be divided into two parts. One part is lower-level work, and the other part is upper-level work. As for the method, the authorities, if they use it properly, do not have to adhere to their own opinions. Moreover, sometimes, they may have to adapt to circumstances to make it easier for the people to impress their brains. However, the simplest knowledge of publicity on the brain must at least inculcate the following points, so that the people can recognize the targets:</p>
<p>(1) Tuberculosis is not a hereditary disease, it is an infectious disease. (2)</p>
<p>Tuberculosis can infect many people and can bankrupt a family. (3) The route of transmission is from the sputum that is coughed up, dries up, and scatters into the air with dust, or from the saliva stars (foam) coughed up by seriously ill people, which are inhaled into the lungs. However, the air exhaled by the patient does not contain the virus. (4) Milk is the most appropriate. Drink it boiled. (5) Sputum should be spit into a spittoon. Do not spit indiscriminately.</p>
<p>(6) Develop the habit of breathing through the nose. Especially in dusty and unhygienic areas, never breathe with your mouth open. (7)</p>
<p>At least take a bath once or twice a week to clean your body. It is even better to practice cold water scrubbing to prevent colds. (8) Do not approach people living together who are suspected of having lung disease. (9) Factories, schools, stations, banks, companies, telegraph offices, and public institutions, as well as places where people gather, must be equipped with spittoons. (10) When sweeping the floor, be sure to sprinkle water first. Special attention should be paid to the students on duty in elementary schools.</p>
<p>In our China, because education is not yet universal, school education is only an inculcation for a part of the people. According to the current level of the people in society, those who have received old education and those who have not received education still account for the majority. Only social education can remedy one or two. As for the topic of prevention facilities, it is related to the country's finances. At present, how much power can there be? I dare not speak rashly. I will not discuss it for now.</p>
<h3 id="e239">An Appeal to the Concession Authorities Regarding Unequal Treatment in Public Health <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>How can the Chinese Ratepayers' Association remain silent?</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the concessions and the Chinese areas are different. In terms of all public utilities,</p>
<p>the concessions are naturally better than the Chinese areas. The first reason is that the residents</p>
<p>of the concessions pay higher taxes, and the second is that foreigners handle things</p>
<p>better than the Chinese.</p>
<p>However, upon careful observation, the so-called concessions cannot be regarded as a single entity.</p>
<p>There are clearly two different divisions: the Chinese area and the Western area. Therefore, the treatment is also unequal! As long as one</p>
<p>observes slightly from various aspects, one can distinguish who is in the Chinese area and who is in the</p>
<p>Western area.</p>
<p>Now, let's just talk about public health: in the so-called Western area</p>
<p>, the streets are quiet, except for the occasional "heavy traffic," and there is nothing else out of place. The roads are under repair all year round.</p>
<p>The sanitation workers are cleaning all day long, the trees on both sides are neatly arranged</p>
<p>, and one never hears the sound of peddlers selling miscellaneous goods in the alleys, nor does one ever smell any foul odors. If we only look at the situation in this kind of</p>
<p>area, we will undoubtedly praise the concession authorities. However, if we turn around and look at what the so-called Chinese area is like, it is almost</p>
<p>the complete opposite! The streets are extremely noisy and filthy. The roads paved with cobblestones</p>
<p>are extremely inconvenient to walk on, and some places are simply never repaired all year round. Fish stalls, meat counters, all kinds of miscellaneous items are lined up along the roads! The strangest thing is that in front of the entrance of a charity hospital established by a Chinese on a certain road, countless vegetable stalls are lined up. A stinky, fishy smell</p>
<p>makes people want to cover their noses and pass by, which will certainly affect the hospital's hygiene, and</p>
<p>patients also feel a layer of disgust when entering and leaving. The difference between the Chinese area and the Western area is truly like the difference between heaven and hell!</p>
<p>In the same concession, paying the same taxes, the people living in the concession</p>
<p>bear the same financial obligations to the concession authorities, but the treatment by the concession</p>
<p>authorities is not the same at all. It is completely unequal. This one aspect of public health</p>
<p>is enough to represent the rest!</p>
<p>Concession authorities! Human beings have compassion. Unequal</p>
<p>treatment is ultimately not something that civilized people should have! If you have not paid attention to the various things mentioned above in the past, then please pay special attention to them.</p>
<p>Finally! The Chinese Ratepayers' Association cannot shirk its responsibility either. As the representative organization of all</p>
<p>Chinese in the concession, it has always remained silent about the discriminatory treatment suffered by the Chinese. This kind of "fear of foreigners" mentality and "occupying a position without doing any work" spirit cannot but make us suspicious!</p>
<h3 id="e240">A Word to Young Practitioners of Traditional Medicine (Continued) <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Huiming</p>
<p>If you believe my words, then traditional medicine should be abolished. However, it is also necessary to weigh the urgency.</p>
<p>The principles of traditional medicine should indeed be abolished, but traditional Chinese medicine is not without value for reorganization. However, it must be reorganized using scientific medicine. The past is gone, the future can be pursued. I cannot bear to advocate actively abolishing traditional medicine in order to establish a sectarian view. I only hope that my aspiring young people will emulate the Japanese people during the Meiji Restoration, uphold a firm and resolute spirit, (go straight</p>
<p>forward, embrace science, study the truth, do not look ahead, do not look back, do not go back and forth again, do not enter a maze, and perhaps there will be hope.</p>
<p>(4) Recognize the Devilry of the Current So-called Scientificization of Traditional Medicine</p>
<p>When we study a certain subject, we should first have a concept. Scientific matters</p>
<p>proceed step by step, allowing no ambiguity. If one wants to enter the realm of the scientific world, one must</p>
<p>rely on science. Therefore, all non-scientific arguments and non-scientific</p>
<p>behaviors must not be mixed or entangled, confusing black and white. Only then can one speak of scientificization, and only then can one speak of scientific reorganization.</p>
<p>Today, well-known figures in the field of traditional medicine only know that traditional medicine must be reorganized scientifically,</p>
<p>but they lack historical and scientific concepts. They merely pick up a few new terms to</p>
<p>embellish their arguments, even falsely claiming that the truths discovered by science have long been contained in our</p>
<p>ancient Chinese medical books, shamelessly deceiving themselves and others, distorting and forcing connections, without shedding the traditional bad habits of vanity, arrogance, and self-reliance. This does not help the actual practice of medicine in the slightest. On the contrary, it leads to empty talk, creating a devilish path that is neither donkey nor horse. Let me give an example:</p>
<p>Regarding Ying and Wei, some say that Ying and Wei are the functions of dispersing heat and creating heat. Some</p>
<p>say that Ying and Wei are endocrine glands. Regarding the Triple Burner, some say that the Triple Burner is the lymphatic</p>
<p>system. Some say that the Triple Burner is the peritoneum. Regarding the kidneys and the Gate of Life, some say that they</p>
<p>are the adrenal glands. Some say that they are the seminal vesicles. There is endless debate and no consensus.</p>
<p>Such misunderstandings of science and forced associations with mysterious principles, calling it scientificization with a beautiful name, are as far from reality as heaven is from earth? My aspiring young people! What influence and benefit does such absurd theory have on modern medicine? How can it help reorganize traditional medicine?</p>
<p>If we look at it from the perspective of historical research, it also has its historical value. The so-called scientificization of traditional medicine is just a</p>
<p>page in the history of modern medicine, an insignificant work. We must know that scientific medicine is a product of the era after folk medicine. As science gradually rises and metaphysics gradually declines, it is the highway of human</p>
<p>evolution in scholarship. Therefore, what is the need for us to communicate between new and old medicine at present? We can only strive to build new scientific medicine.</p>
<p>(5) Conclusion</p>
<p>Only the brave can accept the truth of facts, and only the wise can find a way out from the facts. Now, please study the above-mentioned issues from an objective standpoint. Its true intention is to</p>
<p>open up a broad and smooth path in medicine from the truth of past events. Where to go and what to do, I await your reflection.</p>
<p>(Comment by Pang Jingzhou) In my article "A Bird's-Eye View," whenever I touch on academic matters, I</p>
<p>loudly call out that if one wants to reorganize old learning, one must first renew old medicine.</p>
<p>Merely creating novelty is not enough to deceive the world. I also once said that the enlightened young practitioners of traditional medicine</p>
<p>bear the heaviest and greatest responsibility. The verification between new and old theories depends entirely on you</p>
<p>as messengers. In the second collection of Mr. Yunxiu's "On Medical Revolution," in the article "A Transformation</p>
<p>to the Group of Old Practitioners of Medicine in Lu," he also praised Jiang Shaoyuan, Tan Cizhong, and Shi Jinmo</p>
<p>for advocating reform, which is a sign that people's hearts are not dead.</p>
<p>He was deeply delighted by this. However, Mr. Yu's article was written in December of the eighteenth year of the Republic of China. Four years have passed since then. I have not heard of any further enlightenment in the field of traditional medicine. Could it be that people's hearts are dead again? Or is it that professional work harms ambition?</p>
<p>In April of this year, Zhou Dadao, Fan Tianpan, and others initiated the National Medicine Review Society. The monthly magazine they published</p>
<p>is generally able to criticize the rights and wrongs of traditional medicine with an objective eye. This is what is meant by a group that is renewing itself. I am also deeply delighted by this. Therefore, I once introduced an article by Zhou Sha jun to this publication. I also praised Zhou, Fan, and the other gentlemen. However, stubborn and foolish people still think that I am using young people</p>
<p>as a tool to attack traditional medicine. This is truly what is meant by idle talk that cannot be understood.</p>
<p>And the National Medicine Review was suddenly forced to cease publication. I was truly disappointed.</p>
<p>Recently, I received a manuscript from Jiang Jun Huiming. I am publishing it urgently. According to Jiang Jun, he is a practitioner of traditional medicine. He has already heard of the outdated practice of traditional medicine. And now he is a student at the Southeast Medical College. As a practicing traditional doctor, he has re-entered a new medical college. Then, his renewal is even above others. The more he sees the old learning, the more he knows its absurdity. He dares not mislead people with it. Readers, when you read Mr. Jiang's article, you should not think that my previous babbling was superfluous. (The End)</p>
<h3 id="e241">Common Knowledge Q&amp;A About Diseases <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(19) Asthma</p>
<p>Q: What is asthma?</p>
<p>A: It is a disease caused by the spasmodic contraction of the smallest bronchioles in the lungs. It is related to the nervous system.</p>
<p>Q: What is asthma called in Western languages, and what other names does it have in Chinese?</p>
<p>A: In Western languages, it is Asthma bronchiale, which translates directly to bronchial asthma. In Chinese, it was formerly called Xiao Chuan (哮喘).</p>
<p>Q: What are the causes of this disease?</p>
<p>A: There are many causes: First, heredity, such as those with nervous disorders, arthritis constitution, exudative constitution, etc. Second, skin diseases, such as eczema, measles, etc. Third, nasal cavity diseases, such as nasal polyps, hypertrophic rhinitis, etc. Fourth, bronchial mucosal inflammation and pulmonary tuberculosis. Fifth, endocrine and gonadal disorders, such as goiter, irregular menstruation in women, and pregnant women, etc. Sixth, wandering nerves and the growth of tumors. Seventh, food, animals, plant products (such as animal hair, pollen, etc.), parasitic worms, etc., can all cause the onset of this disease.</p>
<p>Q: What are the special characteristics of the appearance of patients with asthma?</p>
<p>A: Most have weak bones, lack subcutaneous fat, and appear weak at first glance.</p>
<p>Q: What symptoms appear when asthma attacks?</p>
<p>A: The patient suddenly experiences severe difficulty breathing, a strong feeling of pressure in the chest, and a sense of terror. It often occurs at night, suddenly requiring the patient to get out of bed, with cold sweat on the forehead, distended jugular veins, and a purplish-blue color on the lips and tip of the nose. At the end of the attack, there is a slight cough, expectorating a small amount of gray-white viscous sputum.</p>

<p>A: There are no symptoms, and they can work as usual.</p>
<p>Q: How should asthma be treated?</p>
<p>A: During an attack, only symptomatic treatment can be performed. This involves having the patient inhale nitrite salts, belladonna leaves, stramonium, etc., and the fumes of saltpeter. Inject atropine sulfate, epinephrine, ephedrine, pituitary extract, etc. Among these, ephedrine is the most effective and can also be taken orally.</p>
<p>Q: How can it be prevented?</p>
<p>A: First, treat nasal diseases, bronchitis, etc. Regulate bowel movements and avoid overeating. Have the patient move to a coastal or mountainous area for convalescence. Medications that can be taken orally include iodine preparations, bromine preparations, arsenic preparations, and thyroid preparations, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e242">The Origin of Pharmacognosy <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Fanhuang</p>
<p>In primitive times, the lives of humans were almost no different from those of apes. Subjected to the threats of wind, rain, thunder, and lightning every day, and attacked by floods and fierce beasts, the suffering from disasters and diseases was severe. Naturally, people used their simple imagination to believe that they were caused by gods and monsters. Thus, shamanic medicine, divination, and fortune-telling arose to treat disasters. The origin of religion is also based on this. Furthermore, primitive people lived among nature, making a living in bushes of grass and trees, and trying the fruits and seeds they found was a natural tendency. Among them, those that were delicious and edible became food. Those that were bitter and unpleasant, when occasionally eaten, either had the effect of treating diseases or caused poisoning. From this experience of hardship, various so-called folk medicines were discovered. Today, when we examine the origins of important drugs, many of them were already used by primitive peoples long ago. For example, cocaine, the darling of local anesthetics today, did it not come from the coca leaves favored by the natives of South America? Opium, a painkiller, was discovered by the ancient Arab people. Tea, a stimulant, was long appreciated by the people of ancient China. Countless other crude drugs have been transformed from folk medicines.</p>
<p>The experimental ancestor of folk medicine, who formed a glorious page in the history of Eastern civilization, was none other than Shennong of our country, who tasted hundreds of herbs. According to the Western calendar, this was probably thousands of years before the Christian era, long before the beginning of Western medicine. However, in ancient times, the study of medicine had no other academic theories or scientific instruments to assist it. People generally knew that something was so, but did not know why. They simply relied on the inherent abilities of human beings, using their sensitive senses to perceive useful materials in their environment and experimenting with them. When pursuing theories, they inevitably resorted to speculations about Yin, Yang, cold, and heat, and discussions about shape, color, odor, and taste, setting up various empty and obscure hypotheses to explain them. These explanations did not necessarily correspond to the facts, and therefore it was difficult to form a systematic theory. This is what distinguishes it from the scientific medicine of later generations, which must be established only after names and realities are matched. However, the experiences gained by the ancients based on facts are by no means without value. We can indeed extract the truth from their rich experiences, discarding the falsehoods. Using natural science as a basis, we can study them and understand them through experiments to form a rational explanation. This is why ancient herbal records, both Chinese and foreign, have the same need for reference and discussion in today's medical development, in the textual research of herbal studies, and in the research of pharmacognosy, and why they are valued by countries all over the world and have not been abolished to this day. There is a good reason for this.</p>
<h3 id="e243">Pharmacognosy and Western Herbal Studies <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>What is now called pharmacognosy is what was called herbal studies in ancient times. Therefore, to understand today's pharmacognosy, one should first know ancient herbal studies. According to Western sources, the earliest herbal studies were inspired by rudimentary botany. Because botany was a pure science at the time, it only sought to clarify the truth, regardless of other purposes. Western medicine would not have come about without the spirit of ancient Greek science, and the philosophers of the Roman era would not have known to study the use of materials to improve people's lives. During the first century AD, among those with abundant knowledge of plant taxonomy, Dioscorides (DioscorideCa6A·D·) focused on the uses of plants, created an artificial classification of plants, and described 600 kinds of medicinal plants. His theories did not stick to pure botany, but rather guided the formation of an applied botanical herbal study. Dioscorides' academic contribution to botany was truly not inferior to that of Theophrastus (370-285B·C·) (a botanist before Linnaeus in the Greek era). At that time, he had already divided plants into spices, foods, and medicinal materials, and demonstrated the scope of plant utilization. From a scientific point of view, he broke away from philosophy and pure botany to create an applied scientific herbal study. The benefits that humanity has gained are not small. Dioscorides' herbal studies enjoyed great reputation at the time. Until the Renaissance, between the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, it had a dominant influence.</p>
<p>The so-called herbalists not only collected plants, animals, and minerals but also used them for treatment in natural science (Historianaturalis). This is the same approach that has been used in both the East and the West. Therefore, herbal studies, regardless of China or other countries, have survived until today. Furthermore, the only difference between East and West herbal studies in the past is that Western herbalists mostly came after the so-called Rhizotomi (root gatherers). Hippocrates (Hippocrates460-377B·C·), the great physician, was a student of Aristotle (Aristotte384-322 B.C.), the great philosopher. The great botanist Theophrastus (who wrote "Historia Pantarum," recording over 500 species of plants) was made possible. These scholars laid the foundation for science, and the herbal era turned into the botanical era and progressed far. Therefore, the path of medicine eventually converged. In the East, Shennong was born and passed down the "Shennong's Herbal Classic." Although wise rulers and famous philosophers of past generations have all relied on this book, making changes, deletions, and revisions, they have only been limited to the field of herbal studies and have never reached the realm of pure science. Now, if we compare the herbal studies of the East and West, we know that the herbal studies and the progress of botany in the West have been progressing side by side. Chinese herbal studies have developed independently. Because they were not supplemented by botany and other sciences from the beginning, they have ultimately become stuck in a rut. It is truly regrettable. (To be continued)</p>

<p>(16) Coptis</p>
<p>The original product belongs to the Ranunculaceae family. It is collected by digging up the rhizomes that have been growing for seven or eight years, removing the fibrous roots, and drying them in the sun for use. There are many varieties: including Coptis Anemonaefolia S·etz·, Coptis Branchypetala S·etz·, Coptis Branchypetala S·etz·Var Pygmaca·Miq·, Coptis Orientalis, Maxim·, etc.</p>
<p>Characteristics: This product is usually curved, with numerous small branch roots. The top has remnants of petioles. The outside is dark yellow, with nodular growths everywhere. The broken surface is sharp and rough, odorless, and extremely bitter. Chewing it stains the saliva yellow.</p>
<p>Ingredients: The most important ingredient in this product is berberine (BerberinC20H19Na5). However, according to recent research, in addition to berberine, there are also palmatine (PalmatinC20H21N05) and columbamine (ColumbaminC21H19N05) extracts. However, since these two ingredients are also contained in Colombo Root (Radix Colnmbo), it is known that Coptis and Colombo Root are similar.</p>
<p>Uses: This product is a bitter stomachic. Because its ingredients are similar to those of Colombo, it can also be used as a substitute for Colombo Root.</p>
<p>(Appendix on Old Theories) It is very bitter and very cold, enters the heart, drains fire, calms the liver, cools the blood, 丨丨All treatments for blood: Ledebouriella seseloides is used for the upper part, Coptis is used for the middle part, and Sanguisorba officinalis is used for the lower part. 丨丨Dries dampness, opens depression, eliminates irritability, quenches thirst, benefits the liver and gallbladder, thickens the intestines and stomach, eliminates heart stasis, treats intestinal disorders, dysentery, fullness, chest pain, hidden beams, alcohol poisoning, improves vision, calms fright, eliminates malnutrition, and kills roundworms.</p>
<p>According to Li Shizhen, there are two types of Coptis: one with thick roots, no hairs, and nodules, like eagle chicken claws, and solid, with a deep yellow color; the other with no nodules, many hairs, empty in the middle, and a faded yellow color. Each has its own suitable uses. However, what is used today is generally regardless of shape, fat or thin, choosing the deep yellow and solid ones. The quality is light and empty, or with a black color, which is an inferior product and cannot be used.</p>
<p>(Note) Although Coptis is a Chinese medicine, almost all of what is used by Chinese medicine practitioners today is Japanese Coptis. It is not only cheaper, but also has a firm texture and a yellow color. Although the Chinese Pharmacopoeia lists Chinese Coptis (Coptis Chinensis Franch), its characteristics and organization are all based on the Japanese Tanba Coptis. Whether they are the same should be proven by testing when the Chinese Pharmacopoeia is revised. This article is also mostly based on Tanba Coptis, and I am very sorry for not correcting the errors!</p>
<h3 id="e245">Overview of Meningitis (II) <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Xiaolan</p>
<p>The symptoms of meningitis in those afflicted with the disease are of two types: typical and atypical. Typical symptoms, after the pathogen is transmitted, have an incubation period of several hours, or one or two days, or three or four days, followed by a sudden onset of chills and shivering, accompanied by a high fever reaching 39 degrees Celsius or higher. The head feels severely painful, especially in the back. Vertigo, vomiting, agitation, and restlessness, convulsions in the limbs, and stiffness of the neck occur. If the disease affects the spinal meninges, the spine, waist, and back may also be in severe pain. Patients cannot bear the suffering, often crying aloud. The whole body's senses are keenly sensitive, fearing being touched by others. Strong light and loud noises are both to be avoided. Herpes labialis often appears on the lips and face, and roseola or erythema may occasionally appear on the trunk and limbs.</p>
<p>As spasms increase, it leads to trismus (lockjaw), opisthotonos (arching of the back), and sinking of the abdomen like the bottom of a boat. If the patient's knees are bent close to the abdomen, joint flexion and extension become impaired; in medicine, this is called Kernig's sign. Furthermore, the vasomotor nerves of the skin are abnormally excited, and slight friction with hard objects will leave red marks for a long time; in medicine, this is called Trousseau's sign. When the disease reaches the base of the brain and invades the optic nerve, the pupils differ in size and light reflex diminishes. When it invades the auditory nerve, it causes tinnitus and difficulty hearing. If the oculomotor and facial nerves are paralyzed, it manifests as a distorted face and strabismus (squint). If the disease reaches the cerebral cortex, it can further cause hemiplegia, paraplegia, speech disorders, and local spasms.</p>
<p>The fever pattern of this disease is indefinite, breathing is irregular, and joint swelling and pain and spleen enlargement often occur. Consciousness is muddled and unclear, with delirium, lethargy, and even a comatose state all day long. Infants may also have a bulging fontanelle and regurgitation. At the onset of the disease, the pulse is slow, bowel movements and urination are not smooth, and tendon and skin reflexes are all keenly sensitive. In the later stage, because the vagus nerve's initial excitation wanes, the pulse becomes frequent, and spasms turn into paralysis, so bowel and bladder control is often lost, and reflexes are either diminished or absent. In severe cases approaching death, body temperature is often elevated. Death is often caused by cerebral paralysis or heart failure.</p>
<p>Atypical symptoms: may only feel headache, fever, vomiting, and stiff neck, healing within a few days, called abortive meningitis; or operating as usual, suddenly developing chills, high fever, spasms, and fainting, quickly leading to death, called fulminant meningitis. There is also sudden loss of consciousness, hemiplegia, similar to stroke, called apoplectic meningitis; and even symptoms that are sometimes mild, sometimes severe, recurring, lasting for weeks or months, called intermittent meningitis. In addition, there are cases of endocarditis and other complications during the illness, which have been described in the pathology section, so they will not be repeated here.</p>
<p>The course and prognosis of meningitis: The course and prognosis of this disease vary with the symptoms. The typical course usually lasts about two or three weeks. Those who recover after treatment gradually improve after one or two weeks and heal day by day. However, sequelae such as headache, dizziness, strabismus, blindness, deafness, idiocy, aphasia, walking difficulties, cerebral edema, muscle stiffness, or paralysis of one or two parts of the body often remain. In severe cases, life is lost within the second week due to increased cerebral symptoms or cardiac paralysis. Among the atypical cases, only the abortive type can recover within a few days. The fulminant type progresses rapidly and is difficult to treat. The intermittent type often leads to death due to prolonged illness and debilitation or complications.</p>
<p>The mortality rate of this disease, according to historical statistics, varies depending on the degree of epidemic, the severity of symptoms, and the appropriateness of treatment. In many cases, it reaches 80%, and in few cases, it is 20%, averaging more than half. Infants are especially numerous. Even if those who contract the disease are cured, sequelae often remain. Brainpower is impaired in children, intelligence is low, and academics are inevitably affected. Those who can fully recover their health are rare.</p>
<p>Diagnosis of Meningitis: When this disease is prevalent, it is not difficult to diagnose if symptoms such as those described above are found. However, to obtain definitive evidence, secretions from the nasopharynx or cerebrospinal fluid must be collected and cultured for pathogens; and stained and examined under a microscope to find the inherent intracellular meningococcal diplococcus. However, there are many similar symptoms to this disease, so the differences are listed below for differentiation:</p>
<p>(1) Tuberculous Meningitis: This disease generally has a long-term prodromal stage, such as headache, fever, nausea, and vomiting, which slowly develop. There is often a hereditary constitution for tuberculosis, and tuberculous manifestations in the skin, bones, lymph nodes, lungs, fundus, etc., can be demonstrated. There is no herpes labialis. Furthermore, the spinal fluid is transparent and contains tubercle bacilli.</p>
<p>(2) Purulent Meningitis: The patient's body must first have a pus-filled cavity such as parotitis, purulent otitis media, erysipelas, or osteomyelitis. Herpes labialis and arthritis are rarely found during the illness. If the pathogens in the cerebrospinal fluid are examined, they are also different.</p>
<p>(3) Typhoid Fever: This disease has a unique fever pattern, a slow course, and often causes abdominal symptoms such as tympanites (bloating). There is no herpes labialis. If the Widal agglutination test is performed, or the cerebrospinal fluid is examined for pathogens, it can be clarified.</p>
<p>(4) Septicopyemia: Examination of the blood can reveal pathogens. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid is especially easy to distinguish.</p>
<p>(5) Cerebral Hemorrhage: This disease is similar to apoplectic meningitis, but there are no symptoms such as stiff neck, spinal pain, fever, keen sensitivity of the senses, or herpes labialis.</p>
<p>(6) Influenza: This disease often causes severe upper respiratory tract inflammation. If suspected, the pathogens in the nasopharyngeal secretions can be examined to clarify.</p>
<p>(7) Pneumonia: This disease has rapid breathing and specific lung symptoms, and rusty sputum is coughed up, so it is easy to distinguish.</p>
<p>(8) Acute Miliary Tuberculosis: This disease has rapid pulse and breathing, and tubercle bacilli are mixed in the spinal fluid. Examination of the choroid can further reveal tuberculous nodules.</p>
<p>Treatment of Meningitis: (1) Nursing Method: Those suffering from this disease must have peace of mind. Ice pillows or cold, wet cloths should be applied to the head to relieve pain, as well as to the spine. The oral cavity and pharynx should be gargled with disinfectant solutions, such as hydrogen peroxide and potassium chlorate solution. If bowel movements are obstructed, an enema should be given. If urinary retention occurs, a rubber catheter should be used for urination. The light in the sickroom should be dim, and the air should be clean. All stimuli such as loud noises and bright lights should be avoided. For diet, easily digestible liquids rich in nutrients, such as milk, arrowroot flour, and thin porridge, are best. If the illness gradually recovers, a warm bath may be given appropriately. For those with weakened muscles, electrical therapy and massage can be used.</p>
<p>(2) Serum Therapy: Meningitis serum contains antibodies that can kill bacteria and remove toxins, with great efficacy. In the past, the mortality rate was 70-80%, but recently, with the application of serum, it can be reduced to 20-30%. However, the disease comes on very suddenly, so the earlier it is used, the better. The injection site should be in the spinal groove, as this can directly reach the subarachnoid space, making it more effective than subcutaneous or intramuscular injections. The amount should be determined by the condition and the amount of cerebrospinal fluid extracted, usually about 20-40 cc. For young and weak individuals, it can be appropriately reduced according to age and constitution. If the symptoms do not subside and the body temperature remains high, it can be continued every other day. If toxins have entered the blood, intravenous injection should be performed concurrently. When arthritis occurs, it can also be injected into the joint cavity. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e246">I Also Talk About Jin Shengtan <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Zizhan</p>
<p>The inaugural issue of "Literature" contains an article by Mr. Lu Xun discussing Jin Shengtan. If Jin Shengtan had a spirit underground, he would surely approve. However, Mr. Lu Xun only saw the bad side of Jin Shengtan, while his good side also had undeniable merits. Take his views on novels, for example. He lived in an era when the eight-legged essay and traditional classical literature were thriving. He elevated the status of vernacular novels in literature, not considering it "a minor branch of literature." He taught his ten-year-old son to read Water Margin, and he advised beginners to read Water Margin, believing that the writing of Water Margin was rigorous and that reading Water Margin would lead to understanding the method of reading all books. He believed that the spirit and principles of Water Margin were as clear, bright, light, and refreshing as one or two sections of the Analects. He also believed that the writing of Water Margin had the same rigor as Zhuangzi and Records of the Grand Historian. However, he did not teach beginners to read ancient books like the Analects and Zhuangzi. What kind of insight is this? Is it merely "picking up the leftovers of Yuan Hongdao"? Wouldn't it shame today's old conservatives?</p>
<p>As for his criticism of Water Margin and Romance of the West Chamber, and even Zhuangzi, Sorrow of Parting, Records of the Grand Historian, and Du Fu's poetry, "all of them are forcibly dragged into the methods of eight-legged essays," as Mr. Lu Xun said. However, we must know that using the methods of eight-legged essays to measure other literature has been a common habit of general literati since the mid-Ming Dynasty. This fault cannot be entirely attributed to Jin Shengtan. It goes without saying that Li Zhuowu and Zhong Bokijing's commentaries on novels were the same. Even Gui Youguang, a master of classical prose, commented on Records of the Grand Historian, and Tang Jingchuan and Mao Lumen commented on the prose of the Eight Great Masters of the Tang and Song Dynasties, weren't they also using the methods of eight-legged essays?</p>
<p>One more point, Jin Shengtan, because of his hatred for the roving bandits, in addition to often attaching some Spring and Autumn Annals' legal principles in his commentaries, "cut off the latter half of Water Margin, dreaming of a Ji Shuye to kill all the Song Jiangs, which is also foolish enough." Mr. Lu Xun's comments are very accurate, and I have no humble opinions to add. At most, I can only say that Jin Shengtan was killed for participating in the legal movement to resist corrupt officials (i.e., the crying at the temple case), which just proves that even resisting bad governments in a certain way is not necessarily reprehensible.</p>
<p>In short, Jin Shengtan elevated the literary value of novels and dramas, and resisted literary traditionalism. He and Li Yu can be considered the two great eccentrics in the literary world during the Ming and Qing dynasties. Moreover, Jin Shengtan ultimately died for resisting corrupt officials, which seems worthy of sympathy from those with aspirations.</p>
<h3 id="e247">Shi Zhenlin's "Small Notes" <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Yin Chuan</p>
<p>Mentioning Shi Zhenlin (Wugang), probably everyone will think of his "Miscellaneous Records of Xiqing"; but what I want to talk about is the rarely seen "Hua Yang Scattered Manuscripts" published after "Miscellaneous Records." "Miscellaneous Records" are essays, while "Scattered Manuscripts" are literary collections. The content of "Scattered Manuscripts" mainly records people, events, travel, and academic discussions; it includes many of his own poems. He also had unique insights on poetry, as he said in the "Preface to Shu Qiutang's Poems": "To take Tang poetry as a gourd and imitate it is dull; to take Song poetry as Chinese dates and swallow them whole is stupid. Learning Tang poetry is like painting a tiger; the meaning of the tiger is little, and the meaning of the dog is much. Learning Song poetry is like carving a swan; the shape of the swan is fake, and the shape of the duck is real," which is very insightful. Of course, many unusual people are recorded in his writings, such as "Old Man of Lamentation"; the travel essays are also full of novelty. The entire book is in two volumes, and each volume ends with "Small Notes," seventeen entries in the first volume and seven in the second. The excellent ones are no less than the "Miscellaneous Records." For example, the seventh "Small Note" in the second volume says:</p>
<p>In the first day of the second month of the Qianlong Yiyou year, the scenery was clear and beautiful. The poetry disciples of Ju Tai arranged to travel to Ping Mountain. Passing by the Xi Yin Chan Temple, we visited Cheng Chengtan, but he was not there. Passing by the Fan Li Guan Zhou Binru Ancient Taoist Temple, we met Ni Sheng Ziwen, who offered vegetarian meals. There were many calligraphy and paintings on the walls, and we lamented not coming with Layman Lullu. We inquired about the jade hook grottoes and the news of the jade flowers. We pulled Ni Sheng across the Rainbow Bridge. Fragrance wafted towards us from afar, and the plum blossoms were less than halfway in bloom, welcoming us with smiles, as if wanting to ask for poems, and we lamented not arranging to come with Jiang Lang. We passed by the Fa Hai Temple without entering, called for a ferry to the west, and watched the wild cranes on Plum Island, walking leisurely and calmly, appearing and disappearing behind the flowers. We recited aloud with Ju Tai the astonishing lines of Jiang Lang and lamented not being able to compose poems together, so we returned without reaching Ping Mountain. We said goodbye to Ni Sheng, took a detour to wait for Layman Lullu in the evening, and ordered wine. We said goodbye and returned, recording it with five ancient poems, asking old friends Zhenting and Mokeng, Qinzhuang, Zhiyuan, Zhenxi, Yutian, and Liangzhai to compose responses, and also sending them to Xiqin for harmony. The flowers on Jiang Lang's pen will compete to bloom before the red plum blossoms!</p>
<p>However, although there are many masterpieces in the "Small Notes," especially the meditative "Small Notes," I especially dislike reading them, except for a few exceptions. The main reason for this is that the "Small Notes," it can be said, the entire "Hua Yang Scattered Manuscripts," mostly reflect the author's thoughts after converting to Buddhism in his later years, so they are all about cause and effect. Those that do not involve this point are very few. Perhaps the reason why "Scattered Manuscripts" cannot circulate like "Miscellaneous Records" lies in this. The entire book is written in a strong and vigorous style, and the use of words is quite original, such as in the article "Recording Ma Shouchou," where Zhenlin describes his travels, uses verbs vividly, and truly gives people a sense of endless changes.</p>
<h3 id="e248">Sitting by the Sea <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Huiyin</p>
<p>I don't know why, but in my heart, I secretly hoped that some acquaintance would come, even if it was someone I often met and only greeted briefly without really talking, even just an ordinary acquaintance with polite conversation. But the tea was fading layer by layer, and yet no acquaintance came. Although I didn't know why I had such a hope, it seemed because I had a hope that I didn't want to leave, and I didn't think of any other place to go.</p>
<p>Not only was the tea fading layer by layer, but my appetite was also full, unable to be fuller. But still, no acquaintance came. Now, although I hadn't thought of any other place to go, it seemed the time had come when I couldn't help but leave.</p>
<p>But because I had to go, several places came to my mind, touting their merits, and I chose the seaside among them.</p>
<p>Leaving the station, I walked along the river towards the sea, walking straight until the river met the sea. In the river, sailboats were anchored at almost equal intervals, each with a kerosene lamp. The moon was just a sliver, curved, curved so evenly, so enticingly, as if challenging someone's eyebrows.</p>
<p>The light on the lighthouse was blinking on and off, and not far from it stood an inn, seemingly hypnotized by the blinking light of the lighthouse, falling into a sleeping state.</p>
<p>Pacing back and forth a couple of times, I wanted to sit, so I walked into the inn. The inn gradually woke up, and finally, light also shone in the dining room.</p>
<p>I just wanted to sit, so I only ordered a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>Not long after I sat down, a dog came over. As if familiar with me, it crouched down by my feet, looking at me intimately. After looking for a while, it stood up and walked away; after walking for a while, it crouched down by my feet again. Soon, it fell asleep, as if it had received some comfort.</p>
<p>In that room that wasn't exactly small, there were only two beings, the dog and me. The dog was asleep, and seemed to be sleeping very sweetly. As for the one who was awake, I don't know why, but my heart was beating very fast. In such a quiet setting, for my heart to beat so fast seemed to have no reason. But my heart was racing for no reason.</p>
<p>Maybe it was because it was too quiet that my heart was beating so fast? So I thought of waking the dog up. But I didn't really wake it up. I just looked at it, intimately, as if it were a close companion of mine. I didn't want to wake it up. I wanted it to sleep, to sleep even sweeter. So I sat there, in that quiet room, and no longer attempted to find the reason why my heart was beating so fast.</p>
<h3 id="e249">On "Understanding Reality" <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Maoyong</p>
<p>After two months, Mr. Shiheng suddenly remembered that someone had once "pointed out" his opinion and made the wrong criticism, so he remotely chased after it to "oppose." This was quite surprising to me, who wrote that article, and at the same time, I felt very embarrassed. Should I say a few more words? I was afraid that Mr. Shiheng and a third party would suspect me of being argumentative or competitive. If I remained silent, I would feel quite wronged. Since the publication of "Miscellaneous Talk About Little Ghosts" in Free Talk, the unexpected troubles it has stirred up have been too numerous!</p>
<p>Speaking of it, it was a small缘分 (yuanfen, predestined affinity). I have never paid attention to the literary criticism of Chinese critics. But the reason why I paid attention to Mr. Shiheng's article criticizing Sha Ning and read out some feelings was because of what Mr. Ba Jin said. Mr. Ba Jin once said to me: "In terms of literary criticism, Han Shiheng is very promising. He has not published many critical texts, but his research on literature is indeed very deep." It was the influence of these words that made me pay attention to Mr. Shiheng's article and trust him very much.</p>
<p>When he criticized Sha Ning, thinking that Sha Ning this person "is not a historical archetype" but "completely the fruit of the artist's fantasy, that is, the author's ideal character," I completely agreed. But when he said that Sha Ning's author was weak in artistic production, "resulting in something very exaggerated and very artificial," I offered a bit of supplementary opinion.</p>
<p>My opinion is very simple, namely: (1) Exaggeration and artificiality are unavoidable for any writer, no matter how good. Even the "historical archetypes" in Turgenev's writing have a lot of exaggeration and artificiality. (2) The reason why Sha Ning does not become a typical figure of an era is fundamentally because there is no such figure in society (in other words, this is entirely the fruit of the artist's fantasy), which has little to do with the author's artistic production. At the time, I originally wanted to say something about Artzybasheff's artistic power, thinking that to say his artistic production was weak was setting too high a standard, especially for today's Chinese writers. Those who are slightly inferior to Turgenev are considered weak. Mr. Shiheng's criticism is really harsh!</p>
<p>However, at that time, I was not specifically discussing with Mr. Shiheng, so this idea was not written out. The reason why I am writing it here now is to let Mr. Shiheng know that I cannot agree with lightly asserting that Artzybasheff is superficial. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Guy de Maupassant, Translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>Had she cheated on his father, she? … His father! Yes, he was an honest, sincere man who did not cut corners in his business, but his thoughts never went beyond the scope of his little shop. This previously very beautiful woman - this he knew, and others could still see now - a woman endowed with an elegant, courteous, and sensitive soul, how could she be willing to become engaged and married to a man so different from herself?</p>
<p>Why pursue it? She had married just like those little girls who, by the order of their parents, were married to boys enjoying dowries. After they married, they immediately lived in the shop on Montmartre Street. The bride, who was in charge of accounting, was inspired by the spirit of that new family, that subtle and sacred concept of common interest that prevailed among most merchant couples in Paris, replacing love or even affection. She began to work with all her lively and meticulous intelligence for the future of their family. And her life had passed in such a monotonous, stable, honest, and unfeeling way! …</p>
<p>Unfeeling?… Could a woman never fall in love? A young and beautiful woman, living in Paris, reading books, praising the heroines who sacrificed themselves for passion on the stage, could she, from youth to old age, keep her heart from being stirred even once? If it was said about another woman, he would not believe it - why did he believe it because it was his mother?</p>
<p>Yes, she was able to fall in love like other women! Because, even though she was his mother, why would she be different from other women?</p>
<p>She had been young, and at that time, she had also had all the poetic faults that troubled the hearts of young men and women. Confined and imprisoned in the shop, living with a vulgar husband who always talked about business, she had dreamed of moonlight, travel, kisses in the darkness, etc. Then, one day, a man appeared in her eyes just like the lovers described in books, and he even spoke to her like the lovers in the books.</p>
<p>She had fallen in love with him. Why not? It was his mother! Come on! Just because she was his mother, did he have to become blind and deny the obvious?</p>
<p>Had she surrendered herself to him?… Of course, because this man had never had other girlfriends; of course, because he always loved the woman who was far away from him and aging, 自然啦(zìrán la - of course), because he left all his property to her son, their son!… So Pierre stood up, trembling with anger, wishing he could kill someone! He stretched out his arms, spread his palms, wanting to strike, smash, crush, strangle! Who? Everyone, his father, his brother, the dead Malaiseau, his mother!</p>
<p>He hurried home. What was he going to do?</p>
<p>As he passed a small tower next to the signal post, the sharp sound of the foghorn suddenly came from in front of him. He was so startled that he almost fell, retreating all the way to the granite railing. He sat on it, no longer having the strength to walk, completely frightened by the sound.</p>
<p>The first ship to respond to the sound, seeming to be very close, was apparently entering the port, as the tide had already risen. Pierre turned around and saw the red eyes of the ship shrouded in fog. Subsequently, a large black shadow emerged between the two embankments under the diffuse glow of the lights on the dock. Behind him, the night watchman, the retired old captain, called out in a hoarse voice:</p>
<p>"What's the ship's name?"</p>
<p>In the fog, the pilot standing on the deck also replied in a hoarse voice:</p>
<p>"Saint-Lucie."</p>

<p>— Wei Ba</p>
<p>Who says the Chinese have no organization? We Chinese have plenty of organizations, many organizations. Let's not talk about the major affairs of the party and the nation. Just talking about ordinary common people, if they want to have some fun, they must start an organization.</p>
<p>We are now a democratic country, so all actions must be carried out in accordance with democratic methods. In a democratic country, it is said that human rights are most important, so holding meetings and collective discussions have become necessary procedures for doing things. To hold a meeting, there must first be a society; to have collective discussions, one must first find people. This is an immutable principle. Thus, there are organizations of various associations.</p>
<p>According to "A Primer on Civil Rights," as long as people gather, they can form a society. Therefore, the number of signs for various "societies" and "associations" in alleys and corners exceeds the number of advertisements for "specializing in treating gonorrhea and leukorrhea." Declarations are issued, grandly; badges are worn, spiritedly. Thus, all 400 million people have organizations, and everyone is a member. Isn't this magnificent!</p>
<p>Dividing them into categories, there are "student associations" during school days; "native place associations" when one goes out; "symposiums" for self-praise and mutual flattery; and "Golden Light Sutra Dharma Assemblies" for praying for peace. In addition, if you want to save the country, you can join the "National Salvation Association"; if you want to fly an airplane, you can join the "Aeronautical Association." Extending this further, there are associations for studying dancing, associations for practicing thrift, associations for handling funerals, and associations for welcoming and sending off important people. As long as you are willing to pay attention, put in the effort, from national planning to small matters of diet, nothing cannot be formed into an association. Although the scale may vary, the organization is essentially the same. "Large" can mean a three-story Western-style building; "small" can mean a space next to the stove. Both can serve as a meeting place and a place for socializing. Seven or eight committee members, ten or twenty members, all acting in a grand manner, how much is truly sincere! People say that the Chinese are like a plate of loose sand; I say that the Chinese are like a piece of sesame candy, because they mingle everywhere and can't be excluded anywhere.</p>
<p>Speaking of the content of the associations, although the signs are different, the purpose is only one: first, to flatter others; second, to flatter oneself. The way to flatter others is either to obtain subsidies for reimbursement or to want to obtain subsidies in order to be of service oneself. Relying on the opinions of others, treating them as one's own, following the banner and shouting, running errands, this is one type. The way to flatter oneself is to boast, make suggestions, issue telegrams, be listed as a committee member, or act as a representative, speak慷慨, follow the prevailing trend, and express indignation at the loss of territory, expressing a wish to be a "backbone" in resistance. In short, one must be sophisticated and appear to be important. If one's name often appears in newspaper news columns, then one will become famous without even trying. If one flatters effectively, one will naturally be flattered into the ranks of "important people"; otherwise, at least one will be a "celebrity." Because today's people are to associations as fish are to water, without them there is no "activity." Here is another formula, followed by the public, which is the saying, "Rather be a driver than a sedan chair carrier." Because although "public opinion" sounds good, "despotism" is ultimately useful. In an association, although there are seven or eight committee members, only one or two people actually do things. Latecomers find it even harder to stand out, only playing supporting roles. Therefore, it is better to form one's own association than to join someone else's. Is this why there are so many associations today?</p>
<h3 id="e252">"Source of Trouble" <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Ben</p>
<p>The phrase "concubine offering 'Lanshui'" (a poisonous plant that can cause madness) a few years ago, when my social experience was still immature, I was somewhat skeptical and felt sorry for the concubines, thinking that this was an insulting way to refer to "concubines." Who knew that the unfortunate incident that happened to my relative due to a concubine proved to me and made me suddenly realize and deeply believe that this saying is not wrong.</p>
<p>Originally, my relative Mr. Li, was a wealthy household in the town, with more than 8,000 mu of good farmland in real estate. In the poor and remote X town, he could be considered a top landlord. His family's annual income was entirely based on land rent.</p>
<p>First, let me explain his family structure: one wife, two sons, four daughters, and a dozen male and female servants. It was neither simple nor complex.</p>
<p>Although he was old enough to know better, the feelings between him and his wife were still very deep. The father-son relationship was also harmonious. There was harmony between superiors and subordinates, and the family was filled with a happy atmosphere. People praised them in unison. Although he himself and his second son, X Guan, were addicted to opium, and there were two money-draining holes in the family, his business was large and his income was abundant, so he was still thriving.</p>
<p>I don't know why, but this spring, he suddenly changed his usual behavior and became aroused. He became infatuated with a dissolute woman surnamed Weng in a certain opium den, spending a fortune to take her as a concubine. They were affectionate and deeply in love. His wife was jealous and couldn't help but feel a little sour. She often tried to dissuade him, but he had been thoroughly intoxicated by the dissolute woman's charm. His ardor was boiling, and he became angry out of shame. He immediately roared and scolded his wife loudly. Then, incited by the dissolute woman, he immediately became enraged and flew into a rage, resorting to both fists and feet, beating Mrs. Li until her eyes were swollen and her face was bruised. When the children came to劝, he didn't distinguish right from wrong and痛擊them head-on. The mother and children, feeling humiliated, became unwilling to consider the feelings between husband and wife, or the ethics between father and son, and a chaotic fight broke out. Husband and wife, father and son, wife and concubine, twisted into a团, not yielding to each other. Benches and tables were乱, dishes and cups flew everywhere, with loud crashes, crying and scolding filling the air. A harmonious and happy family instantly turned into a tragic battlefield of self-slaughter! Although the neighbors came to劝and broke it up later, from then on, an unbridgeable rift of hostility arose between Mr. Li and his wife and children!</p>
<p>This family quarrel was the prelude to Mr. Li's unfortunate incident. Mrs. Li and her children, after suffering losses that day, cried every day, secretly plotting revenge. Mrs. Li came up with a method of using force, spending a lot of money to hire a large group of hooligans to harass the concubine. Who knew that when the hooligans came to吵鬧, the dissolute woman had Mr. Li's protection, so she couldn't be harmed at all. All that was achieved was the loss of her husband's reputation and the mess of the family!</p>
<p>Although Mrs. Li's plan failed, her husband became even more hostile towards her! In addition to scolding her all day long, he also used harsh and vicious methods to stop providing food and expenses for her and her children. So Mrs. Li became even more悲痛, feeling that her husband was using such a vicious means of cutting off the source of their livelihood to压迫, and that the feelings between husband and wife had long been completely lost. So, why should she care about the overall situation? Therefore, on a certain night last month, she secretly gathered her belongings, took her children, and slipped away in the night to the city, where she went to the judiciary to sue her husband for smoking opium, requesting a speedy investigation and arrest. The authorities had long been jealous of Mr. Li's wealth and opium smoking. Now that Mrs. Li went to sue, it was a chance of財星高照, a highly desirable opportunity. They immediately sent twelve bailiffs with a document to 李's house. At that time, Mr. Li was on the opium couch,偎着 his lover, smiling happily and庆幸 that his wife's departure was like removing a thorn in his side.</p>
<p>He and the dissolute woman were caught by the bailiffs along with evidence and witnesses and taken back to the court, where they were detained in prison. In the iron cage, he learned that this matter was done by his wife, and he was very angry in his heart. But then he thought that he should not have used such a vicious means to stop the source of livelihood for her and her children. As the saying goes, "If he has feelings, I will have righteousness." So it is no wonder that she used this vicious plan to retaliate! However, it was too late for him to realize this and repent.</p>
<p>Alas! Because of a "concubine," the feelings between husband and wife broke down, the ethics between father and son were destroyed, and a happy family was torn apart, which is unthinkable. How sad! So the saying that concubines are a "source of trouble" is not a slanderous term.</p>
<h3 id="e253">The Mystery of Life <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Chuan Zhong</p>
<p>Ah! I really want to resent why I ran to the big city to study? This not only costs my brother his hard-earned money every year, but also makes me陷 in the realm of苦痛 every day, isn't it? If I didn't have this little knowledge, if I lived in the remote countryside with my brothers and cousins who work at sunrise and rest at sunset, not only would my body not be so weak, not only would I not feel any life pain</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>But how happy I would be living my days!</p>
<p>I often sigh and cry "Oh! Heaven! Heaven!" Others think I'm going crazy again. Going crazy? Yes, I'm really going crazy because I have no answer to this mystery of life. I don't understand what life is all about? What are we so busy about? I'm busy copying notes, doing exercises, listening to lectures every day... Actually, I don't know why I'm doing it? It's just because of the driving force of the bell and the embarrassing faces of the teachers! I see a lot of people running around on the road every day, vehicles running east and west. What is all this for? I can't find an answer. I'm bothered by this mystery of life. I'm living a life like fallen leaves in the autumn wind, every day.</p>
<p>From the moment we are born to the moment we die, it's only a few decades. According to the Chinese lifespan survey, each person only lives for twenty years! So, aren't I going to get closer to my grave? My life more than ten years ago was wasted learning to speak, learning to eat, learning to walk, learning customs. These years I have been busy learning to read, but now I am beginning to taste the pain of life. Crickets do not know spring and autumn, mayflies do not know morning and dusk. Comparing life to that fleeting time, isn't it this kind of動産?</p>
<p>Living to reproduce our offspring? No, no! Didn't I come from my parents? But I senselessly live to pass on the species, what's the point? If it's for reproduction, then that shouldn't be the answer to the survival of life!</p>
<p>Poets say that life is a duckweed on the water, listening to the wind blowing and波動, coming from瞑瞑, and going empty. Just let it be natural, but isn't this the same as decaying with plants? I don't think that's the answer to life.</p>
<p>My mother said: "There was no cultivation in the previous life, so there is the pain of this life; the pain of this life cannot be avoided," so she eats vegetarian food and recites sutras every day, living painfully in this life, for a happy day in the next life. If so, then the superstitious talk of life "for the next life" is even more vague and cannot convince me.</p>
<p>"We are young people, we have hearts full of血, we have pure hearts, we don't use life as a painful history, and we can't live our lives callously. We should take kindness and love as the purpose of life, and transforming unreasonable society as a lifelong responsibility, to make everyone happy and make mankind equal and free." Someone said to me sternly, this answer did satisfy me more. I believe that the靈 of all things should have human responsibilities, and it is definitely not the same as plants living and dying無爲. But, but what about love? I'm twelve分 skeptical. After looking at "corpses piled like 出," "blood flowing into a river," is this for love? On one side, "野有饖莩," on the other side, "朱門肉臭," is this also for loving mankind? The capitalist's 魚肉, the laborer's 呻吟, is all this love? I can't find any love in this society! Everywhere there is only snobbery, treacherousness and险恶…a mask.</p>
<p>Ah! I believe life can be enjoyable, but because the inequality of human society has shaken the foundation of our happiness, life cannot be loved, but a few喪心痛狂 people cut off the thread of human love for the sake of勢利. Ah! Should we still任 die painfully in this life, or should we奮門 live for mankind?</p>

<h3 id="e254">Harvesting Rice <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Qin</p>
<p>The sun shines on the rice in the field, reflecting a golden color. A slight breeze has brought the chill of early winter. People in the village are all harvesting rice in the field, which is the richest time in the countryside in deep autumn.</p>
<p>Chang Sheng bent over and worked in the field all day, already feeling a little tired. He stood up, threw down his sickle, and took a deep breath. Looking at the setting sun, he said to himself:</p>
<p>"The weather in October really goes by quickly: just hoping for the sun to come out, and in the blink of an eye, it's setting again. I only harvested this little bit in one day."</p>
<p>"Uncle Chang, how much did you harvest today?" Little Dog from the neighboring field came over and asked.</p>
<p>"From dawn, when I went down to the field, until now, I've only harvested one mu of field! What about you?"</p>
<p>"Almost two mu." Little Dog answered.</p>
<p>"It won't do. Twenty years ago, when I was your age, I could harvest three mu and three in a day. Now that I'm old, I can't do it anymore!" Chang Sheng said with endless emotion.</p>
<p>"Hmm..." Little Dog returned him a同情. "The year is not as good as before. In the past, rice was sold for six or seven yuan a dan, and things weren't as expensive as they are now. Now things are expensive, and the answer is that they're getting cheaper. It's really叫家人 to not live下去!" Chang Sheng said with a little excitement.</p>
<p>"That's right. I heard that this year's rice price is even cheaper than in previous years. Yesterday, A Hu from the front village went to the city to sell, and he only got 5.4 yuan for the best rice. Moreover, this year's harvest isn't good." Little Dog said with sympathy.</p>
<p>"Generally speaking, this year's harvest is still considered good. The best have yielded three dan, but poor families can't borrow money to buy fertilizer, and the stores don't want to give credit, so they use less fertilizer, which causes the rice stalks to wither. That's a real loss."</p>
<p>"It's no wonder, who can guarantee that we won't run away tomorrow? Who is willing to lend us money to give us credit!"</p>
<p>"But the landlords shouldn't do that. If they want to collect rent, they should lend us some money to make a profit."</p>
<p>"Landlords, how would they know anything about the fields! They only know how to collect rent rice and money from the tenants to smoke opium, play mahjong, and spend on concubines. How many of them recognize which field is theirs? They only know a few words and say it based on the contract! Besides that piece of paper, what other proof do they have to say that this field is theirs?"</p>
<p>"Of course, when it comes to the fields, how can city people keep up with us country people? Like me, I've been digging in the mud for nearly thirty years, and I can really say that I can tell whether the field is good or bad even with my eyes closed. In the past twenty or thirty years, besides adding a few more mouths to feed, I haven't gained a single cent, and I've actually accumulated a lot of debt."</p>
<p>"The year is really getting worse and worse. The past few years were still good. Now, which family in our village doesn't have debt? | If I borrow debt, I can勉强 get by, but this year, I can't even borrow. That's what's going to kill me!"</p>
<p>"If you don't borrow debt, how can you live? Even if you have a two dan harvest, one dan is used to pay the rent, and the remaining one dan is not enough to pay off the various old debts. What do you use to live on?"</p>
<p>"Uncle Chang, what are we going to use to live on? | We have to think of a way!"</p>
<p>"What can you do, you have to look at the young</p>

<p>— Jing Jia</p>
<p>Since having a hundred and fifty yuan a month, Bian has gradually厌弃 his wife Ying. He said to any relatives and friends: "She is not worthy to be my wife! This ugly相"</p>
<p>!" So he left Ying and a five-year-old child in the country, and mixed with another woman.</p>
<p>To be honest, Ying is not ugly. When she was living a golden girl life in her maiden home, there were many people chasing her. Matchmakers often entered and left her house. Bian was also one of those who chased her. At that time, there was also a Chen surnamed Chen who loved her. In terms of households, that Chen surnamed person and Bian are not相上下: in terms of appearance, Bian is really not as good as that Chen surnamed person. However, for the sake of family, for the sake of environment, victory finally belonged to Bian.</p>
<p>We can easily imagine Bian's joy and satisfaction at that time. How happy we are when we get what we want! Of course, Bian was more happy at that time than winning the first prize of fifty萬.</p>
<p>However, under the slogan of "this is one time, that is another," Bian遗弃 her. Of course, in different environments, there will be different desires. What was once considered the most beautiful is now considered the ugliest. People's hearts are so unpredictable! Isn't it? When Bian was pursuing Ying, he once said: "If I don't have her, I would rather die." But now he said: "If I make a couple with her again, I am not raised by a man."</p>
<p>What can Ying do? She can only blame herself for her bad life. She can only hold that pure child tightly and drop painful tears on his face. She消靡 her remaining youth bit by bit, in pain | in loneliness.</p>
<p>Although Ying's relatives and friends为 she is not平, but what is the用? Bian once said: "The affairs of husband and wife must be absolutely independent, and others have no right to干预." Although Ying's relatives and friends know the ridiculousness and contradictions of the so-called "absolute independence", they are just farmers who are背锄头 and shedding blood and sweat for others! How dare they treat an official grandfather who wears洋服 and hangs徵章?</p>
<p>It is said that Bian married another woman outside and had a son. Ying's broken heart will never have hope of回原. As a result, she疯! She cried and shouted, draped in hair running from this village to that village, and from that village to another village. There is another苦痛 madman in the dark world.</p>

<p>(7) Sister's Soul</p>
<p>Besides my parents in heaven, my lovely brother hundreds of miles away, I also have sympathetic enemies. The new beginning did not disappoint me. Ying Li's future shone with a line of light. I regained my sister Min, my loving sister Min.</p>
<p>When I was ten years old, during the Yuan宵 Festival, my father bought three走馬燈. The sky was not dark yet. I lit the candle and siblings ran around everywhere. My brother was just learning to walk, with a girdle tied around his waist. The nanny Yang Ma helped him, and carried a走馬燈 in one hand. I wanted to take a big step and run around and jump like us. Carelessly, the corner of his forehead touched the wall, and the younger brother burst into tears; Dad and Mom were the most painful younger brother, knowing that we were the two heads of disaster, the two走馬燈 were searched and hung on the wall and not allowed to play again. My sister Min secretly dragged my hand and said, "There are dragon lanterns, fish lanterns, and many, many lamps on the street, which are more fun than these two走馬燈. Let's go see them, don't let Mom know."</p>
<p>We偷门门口, the streets were full of people, carrying all kinds of lamps,欢跃,狂笑, we stood in front of a familiar shop, a cluster of people擁 from afar, mixed voices shouted to see the dragon lantern, the crowd came like a tide, we couldn't avoid it, siblings were rolled away. I was walking while shouting loudly sister Min, at this time no one noticed a lost sister's child crying and shouting, I was crowded on the side of the road, there was a familiar person took me home.</p>
<p>I received a heavy责打 from my parents, and from then on I lost my loving sister Min, now my sister's soul has descended on the naughty child. "I am sister Min," this powerful little voice gave me more courage.</p>
<p>I stared at sister Min's face, sister Min stared at me, the room maintained each other's understanding of joy, in the hearts of two异乡,激荡 up the victory of凯旋.</p>
<p>(8) Shanghai in Spring</p>
<p>Walking back from the dining room, Shanghai was full of lively air, every smiling shadow shone in the light of the neon lights. The window decorations on Nanjing Road seduced the attention of passers-by. "Dream Lover" was情地 broadcast from the radio, and the huang包夫 also released their轻郁 footsteps, pulling their customers to their destinations. In Shanghai, it seems that no sad faces can be seen. We jumped back to the hotel.</p>
<p>Relying on the洋台, looking far into the misty hometown, I remembered my lovely brother.</p>
<p>"Sister Min, we have come to Shanghai to endure hardship, not to enjoy ourselves. Living in such a noble hotel is too far from our purpose in Shanghai. Our first question is丨a quiet apartment. A亭子楼 is also good. We have to start from the bottom!"</p>

<h3 id="e259">A Glimpse of Scenery and People in Bali, Nanyang <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Xi Fu</p>
<p>American gold has raised the local cost of living, leaving people from other countries with a sense of helpless longing.</p>
<p>I remember a few years ago, an Austrian painter of oil paintings arrived in Shanghai. Through a friend's introduction, I visited him at his residence to admire his works from Bali Island in the South Seas. I had long heard of Bali, and in my mind, it held the same allure as Hawaii, making me yearn to go there. This was because of its beautiful mountains and rivers, its elegant people, and, to be honest, especially the "natural and unadorned" women who didn't wear tops. However, the artist gave me a deeper understanding. None of his works featured nude women; instead, they were all portraits of dignified women with their faces front and center. In his works, I felt that the beauty of Balinese women's faces surpassed that of women in any other country, incomparable to modern women adorned with fragrance and rouge. Comparing women with painted faces to the natural beauty of Bali is like comparing clay and wooden idols to the solemn and exquisite appearance of the Jade Buddha of Tuancheng.</p>
<p>But what does this have to do with movies? My thoughts arose from a piece of news. I heard that Hollywood had sent people to Bali to film a movie entirely capturing the local scenery and customs. I was delighted by the hope that we would soon see Bali's people and landscapes on the silver screen. However, our country doesn't want to overly promote things beforehand, so the title of the film, etc., will not be mentioned for now.</p>
<p>Everyone probably knows the name of the Nanyang Islands, which are called the South Seas in English. This area is not far from China. The largest island there is called Borneo, which is a British territory. Further south are Java, Bali, and other places, all part of the Dutch East Indies. Many Chinese people do business and trade there, controlling a significant portion of the commercial power. However, that place, especially Bali, is not well-known by Westerners, so apart from the locals and Chinese people, few Westerners travel there. It is said that five years ago, on average, only about seventy Europeans and Americans visited Bali each season. However, now, the number of Europeans and Americans traveling there has increased to as many as fifteen hundred per season. As a result, the Dutch government has made a great fortune in the tourism business.</p>
<p>We all know that the Dutch government makes money from its colonies, and this is especially true for Bali. Bali Island is where the Dutch government sold the patent rights there to a company, and the Queen of the Netherlands is one of the largest shareholders of that company. Since Americans discovered the scenery and people of that place, they have regarded it as a paradise and gone there to travel, especially Hollywood stars. Since Americans flaunted their gold there, the standard of living there has risen to the extreme, as high as the temperature. Perhaps wealthy people from Britain and France can still go there to appreciate the topless girls. People from other countries may only be able to sigh in admiration from afar. It is said that even the Dutch themselves are unwilling to go because the prices are too high.</p>
<p>Many Hollywood stars have traveled there. Among the most famous are Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, and others. There is a joke that when Charlie Chaplin and his brother Syd arrived there, the local Dutch government, for some reason, treated them as if two emperors had descended, inviting them to play and dine every day, which made them both laugh and cry and caused them stomach problems. Later, fortunately, an old friend rescued them and hid them in a remote place on the edge of the island, where they recovered from their stomach ailments. Currently, Gloria Swanson and her husband Henry, as well as Constance Bennett and others, are vacationing in Bali.</p>

<h3 id="e260">Review of "Fragrant Vanilla Beauty" <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>丨Mingxing Production丨New Guang Premiere丨</p>
<p>First of all, we must acknowledge that the author has adopted realistic subject matter and has accurately grasped and analyzed it, which is indeed commendable.</p>
<p>Rural bankruptcy and the constant flow of rural men and women into cities and factories are inevitable phenomena. However, so-called national capital ultimately cannot withstand the invasion of foreign capital and fails after exhausting all its efforts in competition. At the same time, although national capital succumbs to the economic or political power of foreign countries, it also squeezes and exploits workers as much as possible. As a result, workers are hungry and suffering, and after factories close, the number of unemployed people in society increases daily. At this time, enlightened people struggle and fight for their livelihoods. In contrast, "pure and honest" workers! Their adherence to their place leads them to recognize their own way out after extreme torment.</p>
<p>Overall, we largely agree with the playwright's statement, but the compassion for national capital and the subsequent depiction of workers living in dire straits due to exploitation inevitably reveals a contradiction in the author's emotions. In our works, we should certainly depict the inevitable decline of national capital, but excessive sympathy weakens the audience's emotions, which cannot but be a loss, right? It is said that the script for this film was written by a Fudan University student, which makes it even more interesting. Indeed, Chinese films have been widely noticed by the general public, and with this new trend and good results, it further proves the greatness of the future of Chinese cinema.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, director Chen Kengran's use of the interplay between the present and memories is a new method in China. However, we feel that it is used too much, which makes people find it fragmented and disrupts the unity of the mood, like a running account. For example, when Wang Ada says in court, "Another three years have passed like this," or "One night," and then immediately illustrates it with a picture, it is undoubtedly a convenient method for the performance, but if the scenes are organized and tightly woven together, it is not impossible, and the audience's emotions will be more compact and unified. We believe that the opening courtroom scene, which changes from the policeman's mouth to the scene, until Ada says, "I am a carpenter..." and then continues with the scene to the end, and finally ends this memory in the courtroom, seems relatively good. Moreover, one episode of past events and another of courtroom scenes eventually become annoying. Moreover, there are too many explanatory subtitles.</p>
<p>Apart from this, we must admit that the director has made considerable use of new methods. The characterization of Wang Ada's daughter, played by Xia Peizhen, using perfume, new cheongsams, and learning to smoke cigarettes to explain her later bold selling of her body, the depiction of Ada's brother, played by Wang Weixin, as daring to be angry but not daring to speak out when drinking tea at work to illustrate his rebellious personality, and the depiction of Ada, played by Xie Yunqing, as being cautious and representing the typical figure of the feudal era, as well as the choice of other actors, such as Ada's wife as the pure virtuous wife (her elopement with her daughter is a bit odd), and the child's malnutrition, are all very good.</p>
<p>It should also be pointed out that the night scene outside the window, from night to dawn, discovering that the daughter has brought a man home because of her cigarette, the riotous scene in the factory, the scene of the police catching Ada and his brother, burning cakes, and Ada teasing his child, are all very good. In particular, the depiction of Wang Ada's family is full of genuine Chinese living habits. The "cartoon" of gold yuan toppling Chinese chimneys is also good.</p>
<p>However, there are also some minor shortcomings: the depiction of Ada's wife running away lacks sufficient foreshadowing, resulting in oddness. Many shots in the playground take up too much time. The scene of Ada taking the child to the hospital can be omitted, but the scene of the return journey is meaningful. At the same time, the emotions of the tragedy are not strong enough, which should be due to the disruption of the courtroom scene mentioned earlier, because the feeling cannot be concentrated.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the actors. Xie Yunqing's performance is simply amazing. He failed so badly in "Iron Plate Red Tears Record," but he is so successful here. He has such a good grasp of the character's emotions and personality. He deserves the greatest credit for the success of this film. Xia Peizhen comes down from the stairs slowly buttoning her collar, which is very natural, but there is no progress compared to the past. In particular, her head makeup is even more unsuitable. Wang Weixin has performed much better than before. Since he began to play rebellious roles in "Iron Plate Red Tears Record," he has shown his success here. The best is naturally the scene of drinking tea.</p>
<p>Although the cinematography is not brilliant, it is still acceptable, which is not surprising in a large company. The sets have made the same mistake as before, such as the courtroom and the hospital, which are so modern that they always feel too distant. Why should we work so hard on the sets to exaggerate the plot unnecessarily? I hope the decorators of the Mingxing Company will pay special attention.</p>
<h3 id="e261">Review of "Healthy Women" <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— Li Fu</p>
<p>According to the writer's limited knowledge, this is the first "pure cultural film" without a story to be shown in Shanghai. Although the "Maternity Hygiene Film," which was shown at the Japanese Arts Hall on North Sichuan Road a few years ago and was rumored by Shanghai people at the time to be a model film, can be said to be a type of cultural film, there is a considerable distance between a purely objective "documentary film" and a "cultural film" with positive educational significance.</p>
<p>Although it was not stated in the newspaper which country it was produced in, anyone who pays a little attention to the state of world cultural films knows that this is a work by the Soviet Mezhrabpom-Rus. It is funny that when a Soviet film is released, they use words like "Italian Mussolini, German Hitler Awards" for publicity. In fact, in Germany, all Soviet films, including cultural films, have long been banned by the Hitler government.</p>
<p>This film is a work edited and filmed under a certain purpose consciousness, using documentary film methods and adding many clever diagrams. In order to adjust the audience's interest, several obvious contrasts are interspersed in the middle. For example, the Mongolian people's habit of childbirth, which is unattended and makes people laugh, is compared with all the equipment of the Soviet government's labor women's maternity hospital. This not only effectively achieves the purpose of education, but also leads to a deep reflection on the kind of social organization that can make all women perform their maternal duties so comfortably and peacefully.</p>
<p>We saw the sanitary equipment of the factory female workers. After working for a few hours, the female workers happily opened all the windows, took off their work clothes, and neatly held five minutes of flexibility.</p>
<p>It almost made me suspect that this was the same as Lili Li teaching poor children to do gymnastics in "Little Toys," which is a kind of author's fantasy; a viewer behind me was whispering: "This is something that can't be done in practice." It is true that this cannot be done in China or Europe, America, and Japan, but what is shown in this film is the Soviet Union under another social order. There is a famous saying: "When a film is in the hands of ignorant deceivers, it will not only fail to benefit the audience, but will also spread harmful seeds to them, but when the audience themselves have obtained the film, when the film is grasped in the hands of the real activists of the new culture, it will become one of the most powerful tools of mass education." "Healthy Women" proves the correctness of this sentence. This film can bring many benefits to the audience, whether in terms of knowledge or understanding.</p>
<p>Comparing this film with those films that are made for profit and cause the audience to have bad reactions, I think the smart audience will definitely get a clear answer.</p>
<h3 id="e262">Our Jin Yan is Actually Like This! <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— He</p>
<p>It's strange, I met Jin Yan on Avenue Joffre. Why is it strange? There is no reason for it. For me, it was a chance encounter. Haven't we been out of touch for a long time? Now we have met again.</p>
<p>I saw him wearing a red wool jacket, golf pants, and a primary school student's hat on his head. His complexion was not very healthy, a typical yellow race. We shook hands once. I said:</p>
<p>"I saw the announcement you posted in the newspaper. What's going on?"</p>
<p>"This, it's a joke. Someone sees me as an important figure in a certain party or faction. This is simply exaggerating me too much. In fact, I am ignorant and have no skills. I am ashamed that I can only make women happy on the screen. So I posted an announcement to tell the truth."</p>
<p>"Ah, this is really... too... too... what is it (it's always painful when someone can't express themselves). But why would someone suspect you?"</p>
<p>"This is probably because I played Carmen at the Nanguo Society." He added: "But this is also a very simple matter. Tian Han asked Wan Laitian to find me to help perform in a play. I did it because I liked it. In fact, I have no real friendship with Tian Han. I don't even know where his house is."</p>
<p>"Well, this is funny... " I asked again. "So, is it easy for people to misunderstand you when you act in films like "The Light of Motherhood" and "Three Modern Women"?"</p>
<p>"Brother, there is nothing I can do about it. To be honest, I am an actor. I signed a contract with the company. If the company wants me to play a certain role, can I refuse? If they want me to be a traitor who sells out the country, I have to do it."</p>
<p>"Let's not talk about these things... How is your life recently?"</p>
<p>"My life is quite interesting. I study vocal music on Wednesdays and Saturdays. In addition, I play ball, do the horizontal bar, use powder, watch movies, and also like to hunt. Speaking of this, I have to say it again. Everyone must recognize the face of a movie actor. There is no way for me to be secretive anywhere. How can someone like me be fit to carry out secret activities?"</p>
<p>"Oh! I see."</p>
<p>A car drove up and separated us, so I waved to him and said:</p>
<p>"You go yours, I have to go back."</p>

<p>— Xie Yuesheng</p>
<p>"Sister, he just came from the city," Hongyu quickly interjected to defend Tianxiong, and at the same time threw a wink at her brother, deliberately showing Xuefang the vest. "Sister: Look, he just bought this from the city." She fairly explained it for her brother. Xuefang felt that she had spoken too rashly, and a blush immediately appeared on her face. Tianxiong was also afraid that she would misunderstand, so he told her the news he heard in the city. He told Xuefang that an art exhibition would be held by West Lake tomorrow, and invited her to visit it together tomorrow. Xuefang agreed very readily.</p>
<p>The next morning, Xuefang and Tianxiong and Hongyu visited the works of the artist Su Rong at the exhibition. Su Rong personally received them. He was a young and promising artist, with a suave manner and gentle speech. Xuefang, who had a high sense of aesthetic appreciation, experienced a drastic rebellion in the depths of her heart after this acquaintance. She told him her address, saying that there were only an old mother and a weak sister at home. Su Rong, who was lonely in a foreign land, was of course very happy to receive this unexpected encounter. "Mr. Su, please come to my house when you are free, goodbye!" Xuefang, Tianxiong, and Hongyu bid farewell to Su Rong, and Su Rong personally sent them out.</p>
<p>"Is Miss Mei here too?" This voice stunned Xuefang and the others. So everyone turned their attention to this person, only to see the man swaggering over. Xuefang recognized him as Cao Huairen, a local gentleman with great wealth and power, but she disliked his arrogant and rude behavior, reluctantly greeted him, and left on her own. Cao Huairen relied on the omnipotence of money and implemented his pursuit work. After a few days, Cao Huairen specially bought many gifts to visit Mei Xuefang.</p>
<p>"She is ill, the doctor said she can't see guests," Cao Huairen was turned away. But he didn't suspect her, he just came out disappointed. Isn't this the young artist Su Rong from the exhibition that day? Cao Huairen saw Su Rong walking into the Mei house, and suddenly realized the situation when he was turned away. He decided to go in and find out the truth.</p>
<p>"Oh, are you Mr. Su? Please sit down! My daughter is inside." Huairen heard the voice of the speaker, who was the middle-aged woman who had just spoken to him. So his breathing became short and his hands and feet trembled a bit. He knew that the young artist was undoubtedly his rival in love. He couldn't bear to listen anymore, so he quietly retreated. He took a breath outside and walked away in frustration. Coincidentally, Hongyu and Tianxiong came to visit Xuefang, and when she saw Cao Huairen coming out of the inside, she hurriedly said to Tianxiong: "Brother: Look, how come that person is here to see Miss Mei too?"</p>
<p>"I don't think he is a good person, how does Miss Mei also interact with him?" They both thought the same way, and had already gone to the Mei house. (To be continued)</p>
