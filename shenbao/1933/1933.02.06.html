<p>祇求迎合日本意旨</p>
<h3>國聯迄無制暴决心</h3>
<p>杉村德魯蒙交涉結果</p>
<p>日方傳成立新妥恊案</p>
<p>十九特委會今日繼續開會討論建議原則</p>
<p>（日内瓦）昨日十九國委員會開會時、曾議及盟約第十六條之制裁問題、當時有人指陳國聯大會通過十九國委員會之報告及建議後、勢將自動被迫進行盟約第十六欵之制裁問題、於是有若干代表表示援用第十六欵後、恐將發生欕重結果、更有數國代表則謂屆時未必定有自動進行第十六欵之必要、因該欵僅適用於實際戰爭、不包含不宣血戰之戰事、外復有數國代表詢問倘國聯大會採用報告及建議後、日本又在熱河軍事行動、則國聯將處　種地位、但聞會中對此問題、迄未有圓滿之答復、至昨日英國態度尙能始終强硬而明顯、首先堅持松岡提議不合委員會擬定之條件、主張委員會應立即進行其建議、但聞各委員關於建議一層、目下僅交換初步意見、尙未有何具體草案、至對於調解企圖、某委員會聲稱、在日本堅持承認「滿洲國」時、不復有重開之可能、現委員會定於星期一上午十時三十分再行開會、（五日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）杉村事務次長根據松岡全權之依賴、與德魯蒙秘書長繼續折衝、爲和解最後之努力、關於新方式之作成、討論研究之結果、根據日本回訓之趣旨、對於無實害之修正、承諾至最大限度、於是成立新妥協案、此案與十九國委員會之决議原案、形式上無大差、於無實害之範圍内表示最大之讓步、將詢諸十九國委員會繼續考慮和解、又提出於十九國委員會之前日本須先請訓東京政府、求其同意、故目下僅將結果報告十九國委員會、委員會一面進行依第四項之豫定議事、一面俟東京回訓到着、即提出十九國委員會、求其審議、爲和解最後之努力、極堪重視之德魯蒙杉村交涉、於午後七時十五分完畢、（四日電通社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）松岡代表四日會見十九國委員會代理主席特魯蒙後、杉村事務次長繼之訪問、特提出日方所豫備之提案、努力折衝、兩人會見内容雖未明瞭、然杉村即返代表部、出席日代表團首腦部會議進行協議、先是松岡代表於下午五時許、在松平大使居室召開首腦部會議、結果於四日晚十二時向東京政府發請訓電報、據聞該電請求政府承認代表團參酌特魯蒙意見製作之新提案、本案之主要點大體如次、㈠爲與國聯妥協起見、修改十二月决議案之字句後、接受本案、㈡决議案第四項「根據於國聯調查委員會報告書第九章之諸原則······」條文中、加添與情勢調和之字句、而削除該報告書第十章之「提議」兩字、㈢理由書最後段、加以兩三字句、而以引用之形式、採用李頓報告書、（五日日聯電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）將於六日續開之十九國委員會審議之主要事項、爲第十五條第四項報告書之第四部勸告原則、已經草成之報告書前之部、似將彼承認、因四日委員會關於本問題未見發生議論、（五日日聯社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）十九國委員會一致意見、决定將於二月中旬召開國聯大會、（五日日聯社電）</p>
<h3>藍使保證英日密約不確</h3>
<p>英不反對否認僞組織我反英情感漸趨緩和</p>
<p>（南京）英使藍溥森來京業已多日、聞英使已定六日啓程赴平、英使在京與羅外長計共會晤六次、羅外長對於因英國在國聯所採取之方針、致引起中國人民之反感、向英使詳細說明、英使當即迭電英政府建議、並向羅外長保證英日密約之說、絕對不確、英國對引用盟約第十五條第四項亦决不反對、並主張於調解失敗時引用該項、亦不反對在報告書之中加入否認「滿洲國」一節、羅外長以英使在　多年、對中英邦交向極努力促進、故對英使之保證、甚表滿意云、（五日中央社電）</p>
<p>（南京）因英國在日内瓦進行袒日政策之結果、此間曾發生短時期之反英情感、今則京中空氣已爲一變、漸趨和緩、據觀察家之意見、其原因、由於倫敦方面聲明英國之政策、一由於英使藍浦森與中國當局之會談、聞英使曾確告中國領袖英國袒日之謠言、實無根據、華字報於近兩星期内因聞日内瓦傳來關於英國態度之消息、殊爲驚訝、在標題與論文之中、流露憤懣之情感、今其態度亦爲一變、據現象觀之、激昂之情感、似已成過去之事矣、（五日路透電）</p>
<h3>英報詆日猖狂</h3>
<p>苟無强國爲之抱腰日本不致放肆如此</p>
<p>警告政府應明示態度</p>
<p>（倫敦）星期公論報社論評中日問題、痛詆日本侵略土地之野心、略謂「」各方均以爲日本在西方、必已得到强大之後援、否則不能如是之放肆、蓋李頓報告書旣明白指出滿洲之事、確爲日本無故攻擊中國、而日本不惟不自收歛、反變本加厲、乘國聯會討論未决之時、於衆目共視之下進攻熱河、熱河完全爲中國土地、疇不知之、而日本不先不後、適於十九國委員會將向非常大會提出報告書之時、大舉進犯、謂日本在西方無任何外交後援、而敢悍然實行其侵略政策至於此極、實非吾輩所敢信也、英國不擁護國聯會及國聯盟約以反對日本、實爲憾事、吾人已屢言之、此種態度不可長久、英國對侵略者究爲贊成、抑爲反對、宜明白表示之、國際條約固曾由英國簽字者、爲保全英國之名譽計、不可不有明白之表示、時至今日、英國應有所行動、使舉世之人、知英國人民對於猖狂之國家、並不表示同情」云、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>日蘇軍事對立晦</h3>
<p>中蘇兩國恢復國交。雖僅屬於普通的外交關係。實際上中蘇兩國間并未常有較親切之諒解。或維持遠東和平之積極方法。然而即此一般國家所共具之外交關係在中蘇兩國間成立。亦足以影響東方大局。吾人固絕不希望僥倖取得任何便宜。不過就日本帝國主義的立塲觀之。則以爲中蘇復交在消極方而足以漸進而至於中蘇諒解。至步可以謀貿易上之進益。在積極方面足以打破日本軍閥侵略大陸之迷夢。是故日本軍部盡量中傷我國。一則日「中蘇復交之後。中國將盡爲赤色勢力所籠罩。」再則日「爲防五中國赤化。故日本方乃不惜出兵以維持和平。」殊不知日蘇之間縱能訂立不侵犯條約。亦未有特殊的軍事的政治的同盟。然日蘇固仍有國交。仍有一般的商業上往來也。</p>
<p>所謂「滿洲傀儡國」成立之初。日本爲求得國際上聲援起見。不能不略爲遷就蘇聯。希冀「滿洲僞國」能得蘇聯之眞實承認。則日本軍閥主義者弄假成眞。即其大陸政策成功之初步。無如蘇聯以冷眼從旁靜觀。致日本難於弄其狡獪。日蘇雖屢傳成立諒解。而終於不諒解者。第一日蘇兩國在主義上根本不能相容。第二日俄戰爭往事雖成爲歷史的舊賬。而民族間之仇視。反因日帝國主義之侵略而更加顯著。第三所謂「大陸政策」之發展。匪特不利於我中國。且將次及於西比利亞。蘇聯縱令愛好和平終有不堪忍受之一日。</p>
<p>日本爲遠東獨立一無二之帝國。尤爲遠東之强國。近且抛棄其議會政治。揭破自由主義之面具。而爲澈底的軍閥獨裁政治。美其名曰「忠君愛國。」究其實乃便少數人之私利。壓迫其國内之勤苦平民較往習有過之無。不及。以此而與蘇聯相較。其趨向之不同乃背道而馳。愈圖諒解而相去愈遠。利害之衝突且愈甚。矧日俄戰爭之舊賬。在蘇聯已改變根本觀念。不存痕跡。在日本至少仍時時防備。且積極心備丨丨俄國大革命後。實力减損無能對外。日本可以放心矣。然自新經濟政策以至於五年計劃完成。昔日萎靡不振之蘇聯。今則蔚然成爲世界强國。向其所理想之社會主義前進。縱在資本主義環伺之下而不少餒。日本軍閥見此情狀。羡他人之長足進步。恨自身之日見衰落。相形之下惟一自己拔救之方法。僅有拼命一戰耳。是故由侵略遼吉延長至於北滿。竟欲席捲中東路沿線而進迫蘇聯國境。甚至欲以開拓西比利亞爲訂立互不侵犯條約交換條件之一。蘇聯縱令爲和平面極度容忍。亦豈能任日本帝國主義之任意從穔耶。故斯塔林氏之對共黨中央執行委員會全體會演說有云「一部分毘隣國家拒絕簽訂不侵犯條約。及東方局勢之轉變。使一部分工廠不得不轉其機輪以製造新式防禦武器。···」而一月十五日荒木貞夫陸相之聲明。以爲日本空軍力量已與蘇聯具同等實力。因此蘇聯軍事人民委員長維洛希羅夫亦公然演說。「目前蘇聯之紅軍已較一九二八年時之紅軍大不相同。······今後必能完其責任。在任何情形之下。彼等决不許侵犯者踏入蘇聯之邊境······」。由以上兩者即可窺知蘇聯實已具有充分之準備。并表示绝不輕於讓步。</p>
<p>日本自六十四議會開院以來議員對一般政治甚覺厭𤷄。而於軍事預算則莫不氣燄萬丈。舉手贊成。國困民窮之中仍積極增加軍事費。陸海軍支出竟占全國庫支出百分之四十。陸軍方面除延長徵兵服務年限之外。更增設兩個。坦史車聯隊。積極備戰之狀態無可掩飾矣。更有甚者貴族院議員水野練太郎。·（曾歷任内務大臣現在軍部亦具相當深切關係。）近在議院聲稱「蘇聯新近改變其五年計劃。而積極充實國防不啻對日而發。日本空軍能力尙不能副全國需要。故宜另設航空部······」而荒木陸相之答詞則爲「日本之航空熱已達極點。軍部預算曾撥一部分爲少年飛行隊之用。······即有空戰發生。人民亦能自衛。······」</p>
<p>日蘇兩國對軍事準備之緊張。大有引滿待發之勢。然彼皆忠誠謀國。無諭爲濿爲右要皆不失以國家爲前題。回視我國人之醉行夢死者。能不有以自警覺乎。</p>

<h3>日政局中心問題齋藤後繼内閣方式</h3>
<p>憲政常道之復歸乎</p>
<p>非常内閣这延續乎</p>
<p>世界社云、日齋藤内閣之命運、將於議　終了之後告終、殆爲不可掩之事實、而繼起内閣、將以何種方式而出現、實爲日本政界之中心問題、</p>
<p>貴族院躍躍欲試　據東京訊、貴族院研究會之首腦部、對於議會終了後之政變、表面上雖持極冷靜之態度、但内心實傾注甚大之關心、對於政局之推移、加以甚大之注意、蓋研究會之首腦部、於近年來政潮頻發之際、其所以無甚活動者、蓋鑒於往年清浦内閣時代之苦經騐而暫時隱沈、今時機一到、則其暗中活動、圖挽回近年來貴族院衰頽之氣勢、實爲不可隱之事實、故對於此次議會後之改變表面上雖持冷靜態度、而内中實就所有之塲合、加以預想而考慮其對策也、</p>
<p>研究會之觀測談　最近據研究會首腦部人之觀測齋藤内閣在議會後、如發見適當時機與理由、必出總辭職之一途、此爲無可否認者、至其辭職之後、繼起者内閣則不外如下三種、㈠以復歸憲政常道爲基礎之政黨内閣、㈡在非常時連續之意味上、出現第二次舉國一致内閣、就前者論、則政友會内閣之組織、爲毫無疑問、就後者而言、則有如所傳之字垣内閣、内田閣、及平沼内閣、其中平沼說已漸消沉、而宇坦及内田兩者則互有短長、不易决定、不寗唯是、且政友會對於超然内閣、已無繼續支持之餘地、故此種内閣、實現性亦極缺乏、至於㈢則爲以鈴木爲總理之政·民·貴·族·各派混合之聯立内閣、然此種内閣、因政友會爲絕對多數黨、亦缺乏實現可能性、依此而觀、齋藤之後繼内閣、終將以復歸憲政常道之政友會單獨内閣爲最有望、然政友單獨内閣苟出現、則政黨間之對峙、有再度深刻化之虞、</p>
<p>攻友會八面應付　又訊、政友會期於議會終了之後、圓滿接受現内閣與政權、故在議會中、對於政府的致命問題、力避接觸、又鑒於軍部支持之山本内閣、平沼武藤兩氏之法西斯内閣、清浦内田兩氏之齋藤延命内閣、以及以貴族院爲中心之宇坦内閣等、均暗中進行妨害政友内閣之出現、故政友會對此、積極講求種種對策、對於宇垣大將、最近總督府内因司法官問題而掀起總督排斥運動、改友會乘機對宇坦大將猛施攻擊、以妨其將來之檯頭、</p>
<p>民政黨當仁不讓　又訊、民政黨鑒於最近政局、有齋藤與鈴木問已有政權圓滿接受之諒解之風說、且高橋藏相將於議會終了後掛冠辭職、使現内閣不得不總辭職、故對於政友會及其他方面、已積極活動對付、謀有利於自黨之展開、</p>

<p>國民四日柏林電　德總理希特勒偕國防總長方白隆培、赴陸軍總司令方漢墨斯泰恩之宴、希氏演說、詳述其政策之原則、側重於國民對於國防問題之態度、與軍隊應隨時準備保衛、國家民族之權利、</p>
<h3>法政府亦不穩赫禮歐有再起可能</h3>

<p>路透五日巴黎電　依多敎授與包尼芳德控案之審訊、引起此間及法國各處極大之注意、認此案發生於此時、殊爲可憾、因法國郁文那適於此時到羅馬擬謀法意兩國間之接近也、</p>

<h3>日俄不侵犯條約問題（東京通信）（續）</h3>
<p>贊成論者的意見可注意</p>
<p>二·拉攏蘇俄承認「滿洲國」、日本自御造了滿洲僞國以來、除進而加以承認外、但找不到任何一國的承認、一方面美國採取傳統的門户開放的外交政策、他方面以國際聯盟爲中心的各國、都以「滿洲國」爲日本軍閥一手御造的傀儡、不肯予以承認、終至此日本軍閥歷久經營煞費苦心雕塑成形的「滿洲國」、不能獲得絲毫國際的地位、故日本朝野、現正深思苦慮、圖在其孤立的國際情勢中拉攏任何一國能夠附和日本、予「滿洲國」以正式承認、固然、這個附和承認的國家、最好是東方的一個强國、若得一與「滿洲國」有直接利害關係的國家正式承認之、則其影響之大、简直不可言喩、這様說來、則相當這個條件的、惟有那雄踞北方可以左右世界大局的蘇俄了、主張日俄不侵條約締結論者謂「滿洲國」若一量獲得蘇俄的承認、使日「滿」俄三國相互提携、達到相當的程度、則其餘各國、必將聯袂而來承認「滿洲國」了、即使不然、亦已無碍大體、屆時日本已有餘裕、徐觀内外情勢的推移、靜待國際政局之轉佳、雖仍被封鎖於其孤立的地位、但可以持久之態度應付之矣、</p>
<p>三·擺脫國際上的孤立情勢、像流星似的自由游離於國聯圈外的國家、有美俄二大國、這兩個大國中、美國對於日本侵略滿洲的態度、始終靜默觀望、蘇俄呢、但聞一般民衆與報紙對中國發出深切同情的呼籲、自東北事變發生以來、屢次發表枰擊日本帝國主義的言論、已可知其一致的態度、日本因爲與美國的利害衝突太甚、自思轉　、已無妙術、但對蘇俄尙思竭力拉攏、不肯遽然捨此一線之望、故常相率呼、號曰、從前德國固亦被困於一羣法國系國家的重圍中、陷於孤立地位、後與蘇俄締結拉巴洛條約、遂使英法二國、大吃一驚、結果終能牽制他們（英法）的行動、爲世人所共知、這是歷史的事實、可以　按的、誠然、面積占世界六分之、一、人口達一億四千萬的蘇俄、其爲國際政局中有力的决定要素、是當然的事且以立國主義之不同爲全世界所注目、出是事實、日人謂、如此有力的國際政局中的要素、若能取爲我有、（指日本）抑或爲人所奪其權實操在我、（日本）我國（日本）於此不可不深思熟慮、然後以斷然之手段、取得之云云、</p>
<p>四·聯絡蘇俄以牽制英國、日人又謂、英國在印度及其他關係上、深恐蘇俄勢力、從近東及中央亞細亞的背面侵入、這是英國歷來傳統的恐怖、無時不具戒心的、更就英國的金庫印度說、最近民族覺醒的風潮、亦惟恐俄人從中興風作浪使其無法鎭壓、這便是蘇俄在遠東政局中、可以左右自如的牽制英人活動的地方、、</p>
<p>五·聯絡蘇俄以牽制美國、日人謂、蘇俄在帝制時代、已是遠東外交上强有力的要素、對於美國勢力之東漸、亦曾聯合日本共同抗阻之、不止一次了、諾克斯滿洲鐵道中立計劃之失敗、便地其好例、現在蘇俄的態度、仍與過去一様、略無變化、故日俄若能重行携手、在東亞外交上、雖有强美、亦焉敢再向日本睥睨、近如石油買賣契約的成立、除經濟的意義外、在國交的關係上、亦不啻遣遺美國以一矢、僅此已足使美國對於日本的壓力、大爲减弱、從反對方面言之、即可使日本對於美國的抵抗力、爲之大增云云、</p>
<p>六·聯俄以制中國、日人謂中國歷來傳統的外交政策、一言以蔽之、即「以夷制夷」四字、即如此次的東北事件、中國政府亦曾希圖借助美力以制日本、或乞援英國以抗日、或更進一步、欲兼聯英美二國之壓力、加諸日本、今且急轉直下、與蘇俄恢復邦交、但日本若能促成日俄不侵條約的締結、使日俄國交愈加接近、則中國此種　技、無可施展、聯俄制日之夢、頓成泡影、更進一步、日本且可聯合蘇俄共加壓力於中國了、</p>
<p>七·聯俄後所獲經濟的利益、贊成論者又謂、日俄貿易、若能及早恢復、則兩國均可互得經濟利益的增進、目下蘇俄所希望者、不過信用的融通、近年來蘇俄盡量的以農產物傾銷世界、其目標亦惟找求資金而已、今者、某國若能給她以信用上的融通、將機械及其他工業品賒給她、則蘇俄又何多求、固然、給予俄國以信用、自然要冒多少危險、這是我們（日人自謂）不得不預先愼重將事的、若一時沒有更好的辦法、還不如暫時以物交換爲最穩當的交易形式、我們將工業賒給給她、將她的農產物及其他東西換來、如去年的石油買賣契約、即其例、若能於百尺竿頭、更進一步、未始不可以這種形式的交易、普遍適用於全貿易上去、在這方面、日俄不侵條約之締結、實可爲其推進的助力、</p>
<p>八·聯俄後可於是美大戰中縮短防線、贊成締結論者接着說道、假使日美之間、萬一發生戰事、日本因已與俄國締訂不侵條約、則日本對俄國、已减後顧之憂、防綿亦可大爲縮短、反之、若日俄之間、未曾締結不侵條約、或假定兩國之間、還存有某種嫌隙、則日本之防線、非但須延長至本國領土批全海岸線、且對中國、也須派出大兵、（因爲日美戰爭、同時便时日本對中美的戰爭、）此外、還不得不對於蘇俄、有所戒備、</p>
<p>上面已將主張日俄不侵條約締結論者所舉締約後日方所得利益的種種、條分縷析、詳述無　、但回顧目前日本的國内狀態、尙正在多事之秋、外交形勢、更爲危急、是故、日本外交家之辭令雖壯、但於外交地位之孤立、亦復何補、所以今日國際的局面、直似普冰山上面的海市蜃樓一様、只須我國政府、能下决心、以實力與日本軍閥相周旋、國際大局、必當爲之一變、諺云、「天助自助者」、尙望我國政府有以勉之、（完）</p>
<p>易培基答復周高兩監委文</p>
<h3>關於故宮博物事</h3>
<p>監察院日前派監委周利生高魯赴平、調查故宮古物、周高二委員經將調查結果、　成報告書發</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>、兹故宮博物院院長易堵其、亦　該答復周高二委員文、　緣如次、</p>
<p>較　素委員周利生高魯調查故宮博物院報告書、將用　　以明是非、查本院事業、自十三年　逐溥儀出宮以迄今茲、時逾九年、中更多故、情勢艱危、責職業重、有　皆知、無待多贅、此次周利生高魯兩監委事派來平調查一案、本以無根據之　成莫須有之案、培　及本院同人以國家多難、是非不明、本忍唇負重之志、一切予以公開之便利、故該員等在平僅兩星期、而本院一切情形、無不掬　相示、茲閔周委員等披　調查報告、示已言之甚詳、雖不免於指摘、亦不能不多所稱許、可見本無私弊、何長人言、惟是該報告書中旣於第一節證明保管限制之極爲嚴密、盜賣掉換之斷定不確、第二節下段證明處分欵項外傳移作薪資之尙無其事、第三節盛穩院務於經費困難之秋、工作努力、事業進展、並推崇當局領導得力之功、則已於外周浮議主要之點、業已　靈霧而見青天矣、乃又於第二第三兩節後段指摘多點、則類皆不明事理、有意周納之談、甚至涉及培基個人自由、錯綜矛盾、尤足欵　、以培基個人而言、内省不疚、原可置諸不議不論之列、而故宮博物院地位、實爲中外所　目、年來國際人士、捐欵修建、努力協助者日多、其重視且勝於國人、此而不辯、誠恐有傷政府用人之明、致隨國内外信用、而影響本院事業前途者甚鉅、特搞要聲明如左、</p>
<p>㈠關於原報告書第二節、指摘估價及職員先日買物一項、查本處分物品、均以標賣爲第一步、繼以公賣零賣、報告書本節前段言之甚詳、故公賣零賣價値、均係根據投標價値酌量增價、且有增至甚多者、李君係本院顧問、以其精於皮貨價格、故委託代爲估價、旣均以投標或商估價格爲底本、祇許增高、有許低减、　無流弊可言、且李君以本人遠嫌之故、始終未自購皮貨一件、此亦衆人皆知之事實、其餘他物定價、均由各方監察委員等多方斟本酌定之李君並未過問、至本院職員、以星期六爲售貨之期、初意全爲星期日院外主顧太多、不欲本院職　摻雜其間之故、舉行四次、卽慮外間或有誤會、遂卽取消、周委員認爲一月、實爲四個星期六之誤、斷定謂爲舞弊而又無實據（所謂出諸本院警察或職員之口、卽未提出舞弊確據、又未指明發言之人）、則跡近周納矣、</p>
<p>㈡關於所稱處分金器、理事會未議决、行政院所頒規則無金器字様、補呈備案官經批駁一項、查理事會開會之際、雖係列舉者僅四項、以當時在京開會、同人不能將應行處分物品一一記憶、内於皮貨等四項名稱下加等字、又加無關歷史立化等字様、其意甚明、否則列舉四項足矣、不必加入後面文字、凡有論理學　者、卽能辨之、處分物品欵項、每次得一結束、卽呈報一次、金器一案於去年八月十二日處分終了卽行呈報、當奉第二四○號指令、自應准予備案、並將前後三次日期件數分别補呈聲明等因、當經遵令補報、於九月九日奉令呈悉附件存等因各在案、當然係業經呈准之件、旣無所謂補呈亦無所謂批駁、且原令業已抄交該員、何以有此錯誤、此事旣經行政院備案、則所謂監察委員、無此權限、及劉檢察官聲稱、並未正式討論兩點、皆已不成問題、况監委員會規則第一條、卽有處分字様、而開會有議事錄簽名　爲憑、何得謂處分物品之監察委員、及無處分物品權限、又何謂非正式討論、殊不可解、</p>
<p>㈢同節所謂金八仙盤碗等、當有美術歷史價値一項、查金八仙以及盤碗、均係殘損、製作陋劣、絕無美術之可言、其上並無年月、多爲最近時代之品、且院中現存整齊而年限稍久者尙多、此等物品、凡尋常金店中無不有之、該監委並未目睹該器、遽憑一己之想像、强調必有歷史文化價値、實爲武斷、</p>
<p>㈣同節所謂價値成色一項、該監委所言、純爲想像之謂、尋常金器變賣、通例皆祝爲荒金、其價値必較買進爲低、此人人所共知、而本院處分金器價値、以每日公布金子正價爲標準、則已較通常爲有利、至成色一節、原器且有刻明若干成者、有册籍可證、當時監察委員及官商人等、無不見之、有銅鉛質剔出者、尤可證明所謂進貢物品成色必高之錯誤、（且此項器物、皆係清室内務府所承辦、有檔案可稽、謂爲進貢之品、亦屬錯誤、）而投標成色有高至九四二者、現有標單可證、該監委謂在六成左右、尤非信史、</p>
<p>㈤所謂據前會計科職員秦漢功言私造賬目一項、查編造决算、爲辦理會計通常事務、無可置議、如果有僞造浮報情事、該監委自應列舉證據、何得以用人不當含混之詞、橫相汚衊、且此項决算、均經審計部核銷有案、並無絲毫異詞、蓋該監委所謂科長肖某、實係科員肅某、其時國府任命各科長、多以薪俸無着、不能到任、故科員僅能　付零星科務、又以各欵積欠太多、無法結束、遂至延擱、事實亦甚简單、絕無用人不當可言、</p>
<p>㈥謂院長嗜好古董、不避嫌疑一項、查個人嗜好、該監委亦自知不應干涉、則其列入報告、認爲處理不善、已屬可異、且引于主席在某王府親見培基買賣古物、數月甚鉅云云、尤爲無稽之談、本人在平旣未嘗涉足拍賣之塲、且拍賣塲買物主顧、决無卽時賣出之理、此亦有常識者所應知、報告書買賣並稱、可謂奇談、所謂某王府係何王府、所購何物、何人作證、有無購物發單收據爲證、均應指明方路微信、到本人江灣損失、家中是否　有、該監委素無素故、何由　考、人言云云、何所根據、培基坦心處事、何嫌何疑、　之、故宮事業之艱難、經費之支絀、人所共知、豫算之少、旣爲中央各機關所無、財部積欠、又達七十餘萬、而培基與同人等竭　爭先、初則完余業務、惟亦以極少之報酬、爲國家努力保存而發揚之、原報告書亦且極贊成續之優美、培基等不敢自詡、然心力實亦勞　已甚、卽就　分物品言之、雖化無用爲有用本　　爲之事、而同人同早如其爲負謗之端、所以不避艱危、毅然行之者、亦爲此僅有文化機關着想耳、故　次監察委員會開會時、對於處分方法、投標公賣零賣之價格標準、無不愼密討論、如防範價格之過低、則以投標爲最先辦法、標價不能及格、則加價改爲公賣、一方以表示公開、一方防止商家壟斷、而廢金一項、以數目較鉅、價格漲落無定、私人公賣、易滋流弊、故完全以投　方法出售、且一再以成色不及標準、宣千無效者多次、亦可見其愼重之至、所得欵項、均經存作基金、該監委旣已查者甚明、今茲圓　中一切預防費用、亦仍惟此是賴、昔人以不避嫌怨爲美德、又孰知今則爲罪過也、至爲可嘅、培其律已以嚴、待人惟恕、倘能多得諍友、亦未嘗不引爲幸事、惟茲事體大、且値此時會、仍以有開中外視聽、非尋常個人問事可比、故爲聲辯如右、故宮博物院院長易培基、</p>

<h3>輪埠歡迎</h3>

<h3>陳氏談話</h3>
<p>陳氏在輪次、與各報社記者作數分鐘之短時間談話、陳謂渠旅歐數月、居法國時爲多、間赴意大利游覽、未往日内瓦、亦未赴德、故未能與汪精衛氏會晤、今次係一月十一日離歐、乘輪返國、此來不過如普通旅行者倦游歸來耳、别無其他何項重要任務、記者詢以是否爲孫哲生先生或政府中人電召返國、共商挽救國難大計、陳氏答稱、孫先生等並無電來、全係外間揣測之詞、又問先生擬入京否、答謂、尙未决定、最後詢以東北問題、及陳個人對於國聯之觀感、陳謂問題過於複雜、非简單數語、所能答覆、本人意見及觀感至多、請諸君異日來訪、當詳爲奉告、或逕由本人發表亦可云云、</p>
<h3>唐有壬談話</h3>
<p>汪院長將離歐返國</p>
<p>中央社云、中政會秘書長唐有壬氏、因母病來滬省視、記者昨訪唐氏、詢以汪院長之病狀及返國日期等、蒙撥冗接見、談話甚入、茲詳述於後、</p>
<h3>汪將返國</h3>
<p>唐氏談、汪院長之病、除糖尿病外、更有肝痛、如總理所患者、幸發覺尙早、故加意診治後、肝内之微菌、已將肅清、惟肝中已被害之部份、則難使復原耳、汪氏現在捷克巴爾斯巴德温泉靜養、其地氣候温和、頗適病體、惟以國難日亟、汪氏雅不願久留海外、故在一週後、即搭船東返</p>
<h3>國民參政</h3>
<p>記者繼詢國民參政會組織條例之起草、現在進行至若何程度、及國民參政會之職權、及選舉等問題、唐氏答稱、該項組織條例之起草、已舉行多次會議、但尙無具體之决定、而中政會交議之時、未曾加以任何範圍或原則、惟參政會决議最後决定之權、當仍屬諸中央、該會之職權範圍、殊難規定、蓋旣不能失去民意表示之意義、而又不能與黨義相抵觸也、至於議員之產生方法、亦爲困難之問題、惟將來當視地方自治施行之成績如何、始能採擇一適當辦法耳、</p>
<h3>憲法起草</h3>
<p>關於憲法之起草、唐氏亦表示意見云、我國之憲法、似係軟性者、較爲適宜、蓋硬性者旣須條文完備、而實行時又不免種種阻礙、憲法草案由立法院草就、呈請中政會核准後、再由國民大會通過施行云、</p>
<h3>航空計劃</h3>
<p>記者又詢唐氏對於航空救國運動意見若何、唐氏謂、航空救國、當然贊成、惟須有整個計劃、而能兼顧一切、庶可收得實效、日之侵我、其飛機之威力、固令人恐懼、而引起效法之熱情、但日本之操勝、固非僅依空軍之力、故我國亦須兼籌海陸軍力之充實、更有人提議、中國每縣各購一機、即可得數千架、則我空軍之力即有可觀、姑不論我全國之經濟狀况若何、是否每縣能籌集一二十萬元以購飛機、即以數千機購費之漏巵、即可使我國完全破產、不待戰而自亡矣、况僅購飛機而不顧及燃料及駕駛人之培養、則雖有多量之飛機、亦無實用、再則國人對任何事都仗一時之意氣、須知科學昌明、日新月異、我無整個及永久之計劃、則二三年後所有飛機、將消失其威力、至時我多量之飛機、即成無用矣、現聞有飛機廠之籌設、本人對之甚爲贊成、尙望國人對於其他必要之設備及人才養成等、亦加同様注意云、</p>

<h3>「盜賊」與「死］</h3>
<p>丨朱嬰君來信丨</p>
<p>讀一月廿三日本欄午謙行君來信，我們十二分的表同情。而記者先生的答復，也是很對很對的。不過有一點，記者先生說：「另外還有一條路，做賊盜，然而做賊盜輕則坐牢，重則搶斃，結果也是死。兩害相權取其輕，做苦工總還可以保着一條活命。」自然，做無義的賊盜、我們去犧牲一條性命，當然太不値得；不過做苦工就未必能「保着一條命」！因爲午君是一個文弱的身體，若做苦工，身體旣愛壓榨，精神亦感苦痛，久而久之，怕要受磨折而死。自然我不是說干君不應做苦工，不過與其做苦工受磨折而死，到不如痛痛快快的做一椿社會改革事業受人反對而死。語云：「死有重於泰山，亦有輕於鴻毛。」像前者的死，是鴻毛的列，後者的死，是泰山的例。况且午君從家綁跑出來，正是怕死的表現、換句話說：他的弱點就在這裏，我們正應把他這個觀念打破，不應再拿什麽死生的問題去向他搖惑。我們生在目前的中國，死神無時不在我們的左右獰笑，所以我們對於死，不但不應該怕，而且是逃不了的，不過要問死的正當與否，要問死的有代價與否。本欄專門爲讀者解决個人問題，而正是社會問題，要知道改革一個社會，不是可一蹴而幾的，其間要經過許多的曲折和困難，在這許多的曲折和困難之中，要多少努力才換得到手呵！但我也不是說爲每一個人解决問題，非要他們去犧牲不可，然而至少可以不把什麽「保着一條活命」的話去減少他們的奮鬥勇氣。耶穌的在十字架上釘死，羅蘭的上斷頭臺，無論要達何種王的，總免不了要犧牲少數人的。并且這種死，才是光榮的，偉大的，美麗的，不然，生幾天病，這様去死，在人生旅途上受盡了惡魔的壓迫和侮辱，這究竟有何意義呵！再我又要問　午君係　於何種階層，如果是佔在壓迫者一方面，那末，他今日的逃難和求生不得，正是他多年享樂必然的結果；否則，只有回家，只有把他做苦工的精神去參加奮鬥。因此記者先生不要午君做賊盜，我却要他做賊盜，不過要做大的，不要做小的，要做於羣衆有福利的，不要做於羣衆有禍害的。</p>
<p>記者按：在我們上次答復午君信中，我們呌他去做苦工，這實在是一個不得已的辦法，像朱嬰君這一類的話，我們未嘗不願告訴他，又恐陳義過高，會使他失望，所以只在實際方面說了幾句；現在承朱君來信指示，我們是非常感激！自然，朱君所說的「盜賊」，决不是一般的所謂「盜賊」，而是一類改革社會的大勇者，這一類的「盜賊」，確是値得我們去做的。朱君又指出示一條「生」「死」的路徑，呌我們大家去追求一個「偉大的死」，這話確實夠我們玩味。</p>

<h3>皖敎廳長解釋遷併四職及二鄕師</h3>
<p>皖朱敎廳長關於四職及二鄕師遷併之經過、對記者作下述談話、</p>
<p>予（朱廳長自稱）主持皖敎瞬經數月、觀察所及、無不力求改進、自奉豫鄂皖三省剿匪、司令部曁省府籌備建敎合作訓令以後、對敎育建設事業之設施、曾詳密研究、作通盤之籌劃、本廳此次提案、省府會議、將原設蚌埠之省立第二鄕師遷移縣宿、第中職業學校原址、而紧四職之蠶科、併入省立二職五職兩校、並將鄕師所遺校舍、暫歸七職接管、以備二十二年度擴充農科之用、此事一方面、係謀建敎之密切合作、他方面爲節省虚糜、增進實效、其理由、約有十上列幾點、</p>
<p>一、省立四職原設宿縣計分農科、與蠶絲科、查該縣並非產蠶之區、學校旣無實習、蠶室桑塲、亦出於租借、租費旣年糜巨欵、學生又爲數無多、以蠶科二三年級、學生轉學蕪湖貴池　職校、旣不至妨害其學業、又可充蕪貴兩校之内容、豈非一舉兩得、其蠶科一年級學生、就近編挿二鄕師初中一年級之第二學期、或其他相當學校、原有農科學生、暫由二鄕師兼辦、均十分妥富、</p>
<p>二、四職歷年畢業學生、多在小學敎育界服務或升學、於辦理職校原旨、殊有未合、將鄕師併、實屬適應地方需要、</p>
<p>三、職業敎育、應因地制宜、蚌埠一帶、向以出產豆麥著稱、敎廳將在鳳陽設立麥作改良塲及榨蠶試騐塲、鳳陽與蚌埠相距僅十餘里將來七職就二鄕師校址、添設農科、學生實習、尤爲便利、四、查二鄕師學生籍貫、屬於隣近各縣者、約居十分之八、蚌宿距離甚近、交通便利、於客籍學生之就學鄕師、毫無妨碍、</p>
<p>五、本省敎育經費、本甚支絀、際此國難期間、尤宜勵行緊絀、以節　費、遷併各校、於課業設備、均無妨碍、而可减少、一校之開支、除留農科三級外、年約節省一二萬元、以之添辦他種敎育事業、或擴充七職農科收交當較宏、</p>
<p>六、此係力謀敎育合作整個計劃中之逐部問題、至如何發展皖北生產籌劃職校、本廳均有詳細計劃、實施辦法、所定方針、一以發展全省生產敎育、爲歸的决無欹重所偏枯、甚或受地方區域思想之牽制、不謀整個的改善也、</p>
<p>有此各項理由、故本廳毅然根據省府議决案、立卽施行、皖北人士深明大體、查决不至有任何誤會也云云、</p>

<h3>細雨迷濛中臘克斯勝優游</h3>
<p>五比零甲組一幕孫錦順孤掌難鳴優游足球隊昨與臘克斯作甲組比賽、不幸以五比零失敗、上半時二比零、形勢雖似一面倒者、然而優游努力進攻、臘克斯門前亦時起風波、惜前鋒動作不敏、失去之機會甚多、否則或不至此、中鋒孫錦順、竭盡心機、終不能一破敵門、致使英雄心有餘力不足也、裁判員陳吉祥、細雨迷濛、逸園之中、觀者在五六百人以上、尙稱熱鬧、　　優游隊</p>

<p>阿爾傑　　　　巴爾登　柯却倫　開墨爾台維特　　　　　凡恩斯　T馬達　　　　洛　根　倍格爾　馬許爾　　　　　　　　　　　　勃洛特　　優游隊坐失良機　優游昨日之失敗、根本在動作之太慢、孫惠培之坐失良機、其一例而已、下半時中、王章寳奚巧生等、失去打門之機會亦皆可惜、開塲之十分鐘後、優游亦取積極進攻之勢、黃瑞華遠送中央、孫錦順籃球而上、向右傳送、胡有成射之而未中、臘隊進逼、小梁得球、馬達至而小梁因地滑而倒、急向左擲、亞爾傑一蹴出界、孫錦順帶球直衝、傳與孫惠培、沿邊直上、少於敏速、洛根衝來而球出、孫惠培又得來球、見敵來阻、傳送與王章寳、起脚不快、又歸無效、惠培脚下之球、設盡方法、撥與中鋒、孫錦順見時機已至、奚巧生在無人看守之下、送與奚、然而奚射之過木、卽中孫惠培亦在越位、優游之失機、如此可見、</p>
<p>臘克斯連中二隻　機會一失、禍患卽來、初以爲上半時必可維持此局面、然而二十五分鐘之際、亞爾傑沿邊進襲、錢耀彬地位太前、後返勢已不及、麥達隨後又至、王樹森餐隔不佳、立往阻麥前進、在此千鈞一髮之際、小梁竟至失足未踼中、臘克斯右翼新將勃洛特踼入網内、優游錯失一球後、葉晉綿在離門三十碼之處、遠射敵門、準而且急、惜爲台維特接出、臘克斯之反攻更烈、亞爾傑猛射、恰中門上之木、方深慶幸、而開墨爾於優游慌亂之中、再中、上半時二與零比、</p>
<p>下半時又失三次　下半時初、優游曾一度猛衝、胡有成直闖、迫成角球無效、嗣而亞爾傑射門爲梁撲出後、孫錦順盤球而上、巴爾敦等三人、緊緊看住、孫滑於門之左角、立起再傳中央、孫惠培未曾撲中、而臘克斯之反攻、則開末爾於離門三十碼、一下射、急而有力、小梁祇得屈服而飛入、成三比零、優游於最後之五分鐘中、又連連失守二次、倍格爾阿爾傑、各中一球、五比零完局、</p>

<h3>印度人拜蛇</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>丨世界異俗歌謠之三丨</p>
<p>恒河流城五印度，不畏人怒畏蛇怒，蛇若怒兮嚧毒霧！歲死二萬人，談蛇咸恐怖；自古迄今兮，死於是者恒河沙數。！「註一」不敢捕蛇，變爲祀蛇，祀蛇典禮，無以復加！認蛇爲遠祖，呼蛇爲爺爺；米穀飽蛇腹，乳酪潤蛇牙；蛇具大智慧，蛇能關衆邪；與之匹者誰耶？吠陀經中薩爾涯。！「註二」尊貴兮無倫，匪蛇兮孰親，百計媚蛇誰寫眞？歌之詠之吉百齡。！「註三」詩中之意；如是云云：「蛇係天神之項圈，出其實物以拯貧。蛇有無上之權力，革其故兮鼎其新；每年蛻皮止一次，卽能回復其青春。蛇爲神之守藏者，富有世界之奇珍，有時且能幻爲形形色色以炫人」媚蛇之人如媚竉，羅拜神前求且告，蛇無知兮擁大號，與之配享爲日曜。！「註四」吁嗟乎！日曜之毒比蛇毒，毒霎迷漫東大陸！毒蛇世界類如斯，爲虺弗摧禍已伏！禍已伏，堪痛哭！蛇抬頭兮人匍匐！</p>
<p>「註一」印人死於蛇厄的，平均每年約二萬人。</p>
<p>「註二」薩爾涯swrya是日曜之神。</p>
<p>「註三」英國文學家吉百齡氏kipling曾吟詠印人拜蛇的心理，卽「······」中云云。</p>
<p>「註四」印度森林中常有蛇神和日曜之神合祀的廟宇。</p>
<h3>島居印象</h3>
<p>— 鵑雲</p>
<p>丨誰家之天下丨</p>
<p>青島負山環水，建設之妙，不能不推功日耳曼人。前海一帶，華宇新舍，極爲壯觀。幾條馬路，都是整潔異常。暴日乘人之危，强佔霸據；好容易從我們做小學生時便張「還我青島」的旗幟，費了九牛二虎之力，總算完成了接收的手續．但是日本的商業金融各種勢力依舊不衰，沿着館陶路吳淞路聊城路一帶，十九是木屐兒的世界，中山路的居留民團，時常駐紮着陸戰隊；扯着太陽旗的兵艦，此來彼去，自由無阻，好似青島依舊是他們的附屬地，橫行霸道，目空一切！</p>
<p>青島新報大青島報都是日本機關報，是日本人在青島唯一的宣傳機關．顚倒是非，淆亂聽聞，這是日本人的常事慣技，爲足爲奇．全島事業，日本人佔十分之七八，試從前海朝東北走，處處都能看見日本的色彩，眩耀在我們的眼簾前．當這全國抵制仇貨聲中，青島一埠，竟是包辦仇貨的根據地．奸商奸民，不可勝數，說來眞是痛心得很！</p>
<p>除了日本人之外，便有許多亡走國外的白俄流民．有錢的，開着酒排間，跳舞塲，雜貨店，麫包房，無錢的，竟窮得在街上呌化度日。</p>
<p>漢奸鄭孝胥在日本神社内立着一塊題冩的碑文，可以證明他和日本是有很久的淵源。這神社内有許多是甲午之役的戰利品，同胞前去欣賞，一點也不識羞恥的事！</p>
<p>確實青島是日本人口裏吐出來的一塊肥肉，但是依舊盛在日本人的嘴邊，隨時有呑食的可能！</p>
<h3>蜜蜂的針</h3>
<p>— 郭長溥</p>
<p>當熱戀時總是稱情人曰「甜心」；但一到了失戀，便稱什麽「苦心」，「辣心」，這大槪因爲心已變了的原故吧。</p>
<p>我想，男女終是不平等的，爲什麽離婚總是女的向男的要贍養費？爲什麽總是說男的强姦女的？爲什麽·······？</p>
<p>愛好肉感的人們！我請你們到猪肉市去參觀，那裏並不諧要你化費金錢的　　。</p>
<p>現代的女士們在信上都很願意地把「女士」置之不用，而用「先生」。我想伊們的意思是要呌男子改稱「先生」爲。「女士」吧。</p>
<h3>「表」</h3>
<p>— 張寗一</p>
<p>丨一表三千里丨</p>
<p>當初倉頡造字；也許不會料到在二十紀裏「表」字竟會大出風頭，小子不敏，以爲在自由戀愛盛行時；這表字却連帶的風頭十足，不信且聽我道來　　一雙情人躑躅於公園，流連於影戲院，偶然的男方或女方碰到了一個熟識友人，</p>
<p>「秘絲脫王，好外不見，這位想是你的Sweetheaft吧？」朋友招呼着，這問州的西湖博得不少的美譽。據一般久住在杭州的大衆，他們很忠實地和我說：「西湖的勝境，是留待外來人賞鍳的：我們長在杭州的人，眞的沒有功夫去領略。」這確是由衷之言實而不虚的。在普通的一般人來說，終日奔走，衣食是謀；所以這些山色湖光，自然祇可讓有閒階級去享受。可是天堂終於是天堂！　　在傍晚的片刻裏，你踱在西子湖濱，遠望那一抹斜陽，回照山岡，金光耀眼發爲奇彩；湖水蕩漾，好似黃鱗；到後來晚霞片片，五色雜陳。那時候，暮色蒼茫中；還有幾葉扁舟，緩緩而來，眞覺得身外無物，飄飄欲仙，差不多要騰空而上了。</p>
<p>晨光熹微的時候，你去看西子曉妝的妙態，也有不可描擬的幻力。那新起的湖山，好似睡眼惺忪的少女，給與你不少的印象，有如你的戀人一般。等到朝日東昇，又變了一種景象。那時候顯現在你眼前的有明媚的連亙着的秀麗山峰，有粉白的高低着的中西屋宇：那亭亭玉立的寳俶塔，似乎在歡笑着。現在正在那裏修理，不過那雄偉的雷峯塔，却還沒有興建的可能。</p>
<p>小說</p>
<h3>照相</h3>
<p>— 墨逸</p>
<p>張榮久弟兄倆攙扶着七十三歲的老母，妻抱了兒子，也顧不得桌上的髒碗，給兩個敵人和一個中國人趕着往外走。</p>
<p>他們走到門外，整個村子裏的人們全扶老携幼的像一羣到屠塲上去的羔羊，在一大隊敵人押解之下，衝着狂風大雪彳亍於冰地上向平頂山而去。</p>
<p>他們到了平頂山，看見平頂山村子裏的人們，早就三五成羣的在那兒議論這回事兒。</p>
<p>「敵人怎麽又發起善心了：要演習戰鬥，不拿咱們做靶子啦！」「可眞透着奇啦！」</p>
<p>「聽說借了咱們的地方，等一會兒，宣統皇帝還有錢賞咱們，可不見鬼了麽？」</p>
<p>「你們看喲，又來了六七百人······」</p>
<p>「這是那兒的喲？」</p>
<p>「千金堡的人們也來啦！」</p>
<p>這些後來的六七百人也和平頂山，栗子溝的人們一様；女人們抱着孩子，男人們攙扶着七八十歲的老太太或老頭兒：後面跟的是托着槍的敵人。</p>
<p>「佟二哥，咱們想不到在這兒會面，昨天你不是呌人給我帶信，說有要緊事兒和我商量麽？究竟是什麽事兒喲？·········你揹的誰喲？·········姨媽麽？快點兒下來坐一會兒罷·········」張榮久走上前，把佟二哥的母親從他背上扶下來，一起坐在冰地上。</p>
<p>雪落在他們皮膚上，就和開花彈裏燒紅了的碎鐵一様，風鑽在他們衣服裏也和剌刀戳在肉裏一般怪痛的。他們全聳着肩，縮緊了𩓐子，兩個手互相叉在袖子裏面，也不問地上濕不濕，全盤膝坐在冰上面。佟二哥搖了兩下頭，脖子縮了一縮，才要開口回答張榮久，忽然一陣尖銳的哨子聲音響了起來，那些敵人便把他們押解得來的羔羊全集合在一起。跟着又是一聲口令，敵人便四面散開，取了一個包圍式；三個村子裏的三千多男男，女女。老老，少少的人們站在中間，向那些包圍他們的敵人莫明其妙的看着。（五）</p>
<p>話會使他倆受窘，於是急出極法來了，　　「别胡說，這是舍表妹？」確然，這表字最合於解窘，所謂一表三千里，姨夫的兒女是表，舅父的兒女也是表，姑母的兒女亦是表，要是「表」字不加上，假使你沒有姊妹的話，人家豈不要說「以前倒沒有聽見你說起呀！」、］</p>
<p>還有一般大人先生，姬妾如雲，當然爲着某一種的需要，她們會出外去掠野食不，也許是講戀愛，但，偶然的被老鳥龜（至少在他的姬妾看起來）碰到：於是伊們也得借重這「表」字了！</p>
<p>「啊，老爺這是我的表兄，剛從×處來」伊會很妖媚地說，但前者是有緋色色彩；而且是怕人說笑，所以用這「表」字，後者却自以爲不正當，况且尤不敢說留這是伊的情人，所以雖說「表」字風頭十足，但同是一字也有幸有不幸，用在後者，我想「表」字有靈，也許會自慚形穢吧？</p>
<h3>詩意的杭州</h3>
<p>— 柯定盦</p>
<p>丨這世紀的安樂土丨</p>
<p>「天堂在蘇杭」的傳說，誘惑得到中國來的外國人士都默許，尤其是杭　　平湖秋月，三潭印月···是賞月的好處所。賞月雖然是過去了，孤山的踏雪尋梅正是未來的雅人深致呢！</p>
<p>「城站，」是杭州的車站，自從新市塲興辦以來日形黯淡；就是旅店生涯，差不多也移向西面去了。不過近年來，正力求精進，不减於新市塲的繁盛。近來滬杭公路完成，又增進了一層。那附近的地方，也興築公園，以便遊人駐足。這様，將來的杭州，正未可限量呢！</p>
<p>婦女的樂園</p>
<h3>女子與家政</h3>
<p>— 鵑雲</p>
<p>家庭是社會，國家的基礎。所謂「齊家治國平天下」丨家不齊，則國不治；國不治，天下大亂矣！</p>
<p>所以女子主持家政，不是什麽卑賤的事；做主母不曾看低了女子的身份。</p>
<p>現代的女子似乎都誤會了。以爲女子正不必管這些瑣碎的家事，也應當挺出身子立在社會國家政治之上。</p>
<p>這固然不錯。人類是應當平等的，女子何嘗沒有參政的資格。</p>
<p>可是有了孟母，纔能造就成孟子。有了岳母，纔有赤膽忠心的岳武穆。「母敎」是何等重要！何等偉大！·</p>
<p>倘若是女子都情願抛棄家庭生活，那們將來的子女，應都是些毫無敎育的野人！縱使女子自己能努力些社會事業與政治生活，仍舊是「得不償失」！</p>
<p>所以女子寗可在主持家政之外，一様能運用才智和思想，發揮有力的議論，創做偉大的事業。正不必輕易地放棄了家庭裏的地位。</p>
<p>我想這一個女子可以含笑九泉，因爲常常見女子身後，靈幃前四個大字「賢母遺敎！」</p>
<h3>女性與和平</h3>
<p>— 鵑雲</p>
<p>花枝灼灼難描，正埀髫。家住綠揚津畔，跨紅橋；眉峯秀，鶑聲溜，試瓊簫。最愛猩脣輕破「小櫻桃。」這是薛瓊女士的一闋小詞。</p>
<p>女性活潑的天眞，愉快的精神，温柔的情致，都流露在這字句之中。</p>
<p>這足以使大地間返迥了春日的光華，是世界上的和平之神！比了什麽都應當尊崇，像這般黃金可貴的少女光陰！男性似乎眞殘酷，眞凶暴！世界上已經造成了不可收拾現况。鼙鼓戰聲中，演出種種人類搏殺的慘劇！</p>
<p>人類是不能平等的！武力是殘酷的！男性似乎是主張用弱肉强食爲公例的！</p>
<p>試看現在世界的和平，國際聯盟，都僅僅是套上了虚僞的假面具！本來的一副狰獰相，不時都能看見這些遮隱不住的痕跡；醖釀的結果，免不了造成第二次世界大戰！</p>
<p>「兵凶戰危！」這是世界上人人所公認的。詩人杜甫的兵車行李華的弔古戰塲文已很能夠描寫出「戰」的痛苦。杜甫詩中有幾句寫的是：「信知生男惡；反是生女好！生女猶得嫁比鄰，生男埋沒在百草！」雖是處在當時男尊女卑的時代中，竟能寫出這般哀感酷愛和平的句子。確是惟有女性纔能維持將來世界上的和平！</p>

<h3>上海市近十年來醫藥鳥瞰（續）</h3>
<p>— 龐京周</p>
<p>第三章　業務之情形</p>
<p>凡是醫院，已不是賺錢生涯，而况公立醫院，負着博濟羣黎，服務公衆的責任，尤其非賠本不可。於是不能不有所謂基金，靠基金的利息，以資挹注。外國人所辦醫院，大都有已籌基金的，而中國人所辦的醫院，照上表所列，简直一個都沒有基金。最好的，不過自購基地，自建院屋，靠着常年捐欵，用作經常之費。其次的，租賃院屋，也靠着董事，分擔常年捐欵，而另有幾個董事中的中堅份子，有力商家，自作後盾，萬一醫院缺乏金錢的時候，便由幾個中堅份子出來，沿門托鉢，募集捐欵，或則自掏腰包，勉力維持而已。但是通商大埠，人事的變遷甚速，貧富窮通，更不能預料，有力商人，未必永遠有力，善交的名人，也有舞袖郎當的時候，於是醫院的興衰，便跟着董事個人的盈虧爲轉移。所以老醫院旣忙着新董事和新力量的追求，而不能日進於業，新醫院，更不敢次第成立了。據我所知，竟有租賃房屋的醫院，付不出房租的，漸漸因爲不支而至於消滅。然而假使社會上人士，對於醫院的興趣濃厚，那麽像上海這種大埠，經濟力究竟不比内地，每年總有幾十個發財的大商家，理應有欵可辦醫院，但是第一點，社會上充滿着舊觀念，覺得醫院是西法，不合於國人習慣，不願把金錢交給新醫界，去發展他們的業務：第二點，向來中國資本家出了錢，必要管事，假使他自問，對於醫藥是外行，情願把錢做其他慈善事業，比較醒豁，於是你發你的米票，我施我的棉衣，各做各的小規様慈善，弄得經費旣不集中，而慈善事業，走向消極一方面去，若說拿辦醫院的責任，推在我們醫界身上，我們實在無此力量，並且要責備新醫界，爲什麽不辦好好兒的公立醫院，彷彿責備壽器店，爲什麽不給施棺材一様不通，而必待新思想的商人發財，機會未免更少。於是醫院創立的可能性，就格外的小了。</p>
<p>對於引起資本家的興趣，這層却非一蹴可幾，必須社會上一種舊勢力失敗之後，他們才肯覺悟。或者經過新醫界的努力。使他們得到新醫的好處，然後興趣也有了，但是照目前情况，却很難得到效果，爲什麽呢？因爲資本家即使自己要住醫院的時候，他可以出狠高的代價，住外國人所辦就的醫院，而一方面，却責備中國人自辦的醫院，如何腐敗，如何沒有秩序，實在醫院所以辦不好，三之一，固在人才，而三之二，仍舊在經濟與社會上一種扶助的精神上。還有一層，我覺得我國政府方面諸公，對於醫院，也未必有什麽興趣，試看，凡是要人稱病請假，或是下野養疴，都住着外國醫院，而且大都住外國的私立療養院，推想他們的心理，早認爲醫院是洋貨，也就是高等人民所吃的大菜，而並非平民所必需罷了。對資本家因外行而不願出資一層，我這裏却有一個例子，可供社會上人士的參考：</p>
<p>北平有一個協和醫院，大家都知道是煤油大王羅氏基金所辦的，但是羅氏自己，却從來不問醫院内的行政，另由羅氏基金委員會，交給一個醫務委員會去辦理，譬如協和醫院，是在中國的，就交給「中國醫務委員會」去辦，裏頭的委員，無非在華的著名醫家，用精密的考慮，選舉出來，内行負全責，有全權，所以這醫院，便井井有條，而一方面爲保持出資人的所有權起見，將醫院的全部財產，用最低的代價，算租賃給這個團體的，數百萬產價，每年的租金祇定美金一元，立有契約，並訂有期限，這區區租金，雖等於零，然而却保持了法律上地位。假如出資人以爲這個團體辦理不善的時候，可以聲明到期契約中止，收國來交給另一班人辦理，如此，則要辦的人，無有不熱心求工的了。</p>

<p>在科學未昌明時。人類生命。神秘莫測。病不知其何以病。死不知其何以死。於百思不得其解之時。不得已求神拜佛。思所禳除。禳除不能。乃乞靈於種種不可思議之廢物。如死人枕蓆。自縊死繩。童子小便。病人衣服。婦人月經。婦人陰毛等等。無不羅作藥用。以死人枕蓆言。昔陳藏器曰。有嫗久患冷滯。積年不瘥。宋徐嗣白曰。此尸疰也。當以死人枕煑服之乃愈，於是往古塜中取死人枕。枕已腐缺一角。嫗服之即瘥。此一例也。以自縊死繩言。李時珍曰。斬水有一富家子。游娼寮。驚走仆于刑人屍上。大駭發狂。醫者龐安常。取絞死囚之繩燒灰和藥服之遂愈。此又一例也。以病人衣服言。李時珍曰。天行瘟疫時。取初病者衣服。置甑内蒸之。則一家不病。此又一例也。以人尿言。方家謂之輪𢌞酒。還元湯。朱震亨曰。小便能降火升濁。常見老婦。年逾八十。貎如四十許人。問其故。常有惡疾。有人勸令服尿。四十餘年。竟能返老還童。此又一例也。以婦人月經言。博物志云。交州夷人。以焦銅爲毒藥。塗於鋒鏇。中人即腐。須臾骨壞。但服婦人月經及尿汁即能解之。此又一例也。以婦人陰毛言。聖濟總錄云。病後交接。卵腫或縮入腹絞痛欲死。取婦人陰毛燒灰飲服。仍以洗陰水飲之即愈。此又一例也。方書所載。穿鑿附會。以某物爲靈丹。以某物爲仙草。如禹王餘糧。生會稽山中。昔禹王於此。棄其餘食於江中。後人取以爲藥。故名禹餘糧。又昔有杜仲。服某藥得道。因以名之。又劉寄奴草本意。昔宋高祖劉裕。小字寄奴。微時遇一大蛇射之。明日往聞杵臼聲。尋之。見童子數人。皆青衣。於樹林中擣藥。問其故。答曰。我主爲劉寄奴所射。今合藥敷之。裕曰。汝主何不殺之。曰。寄奴王者。不能殺也。裕斥之。童子皆散。乃取其藥而返。每患金瘡。敷之即愈。此又一例也。</p>

<h3>中國之肺病問題（續）</h3>
<p>— 丁惠康</p>
<p>肺結核與手術之施行</p>
<p>肺結核治療之難。世所共知。蓋患者若僅服藥注射。或轉地療養。暫時雖能收效。而日後復發者。幾占多數。現代醫學。雖日進步。而對於肺結核。尙無特效藥。故最近療肺醫學。已脫離内科範圍。而改用外科手術。以直接壓縮病灶。使其盡量休息。以提高患體之抵抗力爲主旨。在歐美各國肺病療養院中。對於肺病患者。苟能及時施行手術。其結果至爲美滿確實。惜我國醫院。多缺乏各種設備。及專門人材。而病家對於手術亦往往談虎色變。不能有相當之瞭解。坐致肺癆猖獗。爲可憾耳。茲將最近世界日常施行之各種手術。約述於下。</p>
<p>人工氣胸術　吾人有左右二肺。位於胸腔之内。胸腔之内壁。有薄膜一層。與包圍肺外面之一層薄膜。互相連接。此兩層薄膜之空間。吾人名之曰肋膜腔。内不含氣體。故人之兩肺於呼吸間。肺臟得以自由伸張。因肋膜腔間。不含氣體。肺外無壓力故也。</p>
<p>若一旦肺臟有病。吾人當令其完全休息。則可事半功倍。而健康之肺。同時仍當照常工作。此種理想。現已成爲事實。即人工氣胸術是也。</p>
<p>人工氣胸術者。即送入一種氣體於胸壁腔内。及肺臟外面之肋膜腔間。而使肺壓縮。得獲允分之休息。</p>
<p>吾人咸知結核病勢之進行。以病肺之運動爲其主要原因。若病肺經手術後。則直接使之壓縮肺臟。血液及淋巴液之循環遲緩。阻止結核菌病毒之分布。同時促進肺内結締組織之增殖。與健全部分相劃離。如是則病理的現象。漸漸消滅。病肺得以完全休息。由是可免病勢之進行。而達治療之目的。</p>
<p>人工氣胸在實際上之意義。實不僅使病肺萎縮靜止。而促進治療之趨向。得延長病人之生命而已。同時且能防止傳染他側健康之肺。及其家屬。故在結核治療及預防方面。人工氣胸實占最高權威。而爲吾人所不可忽視者也。</p>
<p>臨床之觀察　施行工氣胸以後。於臨床觀察。果何如乎。以余歷年施行之結果而論。實至美滿。若三十八度以上之熱型。肺部之小泡音。盜汗咳嗽咯痰等。經手術後。大都於十日左右。即可恢復平常之體温。消滅其中毒現象。而自二個半月以後。痰中即可不見結核菌。此種良好之成績。斷非安靜療法或各種注射療法所可企及。不能不歸功於人工氣者也。</p>
<h3>痰說二</h3>
<p>— 余雲岫</p>
<p>鄒潤安作本經序疏要。其論痰飲曰。「内經未嘗言及痰飲。金匮要略則詳論之矣。然及飲多而及痰少。千金外臺。則已痰飲參半。沿至後世。及飲日少而痰日多。」此言是矣。又曰。「此世道升降之會也。」則非是矣。蓋痰字之義。古今解釋不同。故所論之病。名同實異。非痰之爲病古少而今多也。金匱所言之痰飲。乃胃腸之水。脈經所載。與金匱同。然金匱脈經。未嘗單獨言痰。有之。惟於伏飲一見之耳。亦未嘗分别痰與飲而對待言之。至巢元方病源候論則曰。「痰飲者。由氣脈閉塞。津液不通。水飲氣停在胸府。結而成痰」始獨立言痰矣。又曰「脈偏弦爲痰。浮而滑爲飲。」始以痰與飲對待矣。金匱以脈偏弦爲飲。且曰。肺飲不弦。但苦喘短氣。巢氏則易脈偏弦而屬之痰。别造一浮滑之脈而屬之飲。可謂盡改仲景之舊矣。觀其論諸痰之候。則曰痰水結聚。飲水結聚。論諸飲。則曰水氣停留。水氣停聚。夫結者。變其舊貫。亦猶露結而爲霜也。停者。仍其本態。亦猶川停而爲</p>

<p>淵也。是則巢氏之所謂痰。已非飲之舊貫。而爲飲之變相矣。後人以粘稠涏沬及濃厚之濁唾爲痰。實萌芽於此。特其謂由水飲結聚而成。則尙認痰之成就。爲由飲而來。此則未盡脫離金匮之說耳。由是言之。巢氏之所謂痰。上紹仲景之言。下開後世之門。實痰說古今變遷之過渡關鍵也。千金外臺之論談。亦過渡時代之物。蓋隋之與唐。時代相接。醫家之論。未甚變易也。千金旋覆花湯。主胸隔痰結。唾如膠。此即今人所謂粘稠之痰也。其所謂停痰澼飲之類。大半皆是胃病。薑附湯之嘔沬。乃胃中之粘液。後世之所謂胃痰也。實爲胃粘膜炎之證候。撩隔散之飲實寒冷。薑附湯之痰冷。吳茉萸湯之胸中結冷。心中嘈。皆與呑酸吐水。同一疾病。乃胃酸過多之見證。千金翼赤石脂散之吐水。亦即此病。與今所謂痰者，無關係也。然病源論千金方千金翼方外臺秘要等。雖已認粘稠之涏唾爲痰。然其所述痰飲各病之候。除引金匮舊文外。（如支飲懸飲有欬嗽之證。）皆鮮有及於欬嗽者。以是知其所謂粘稠之痰。皆胃之粘液。皆急性或慢性胃粘膜炎之病候，非今人所謂由欬唾而出之痰也。以今日之所知。以推測古人所說載之病候。每不能十分確當。以古人之觀察不十分精密。而記載不十分詳細故也。然其粗大之證候。尙有可據者。如金匮述痰飲。有素盛今瘦。水走腸間。瀝瀝有聲之文。知其腸之消化吸收機能。障碍頗甚。營養爲之不良。故瘦削也。且有氣體發生於腸間。而腸之内容。本爲流體。氣與水合流。故瀝瀝有聲也。此必胃腸中有狹窄之處。擴張之處。不然。則有消化不良。或運動遲鈍。或發酵腐敗等病而致然也。支飲之證候。有欬逆。倚息。短氣。不得臥。其形如腫。又有喘滿。心下痞堅。苦冒眩。不渴等證。此即所謂水在心。心下堅築短氣。惡水不欲飲也。此必心臟有病。若左側濕性肋膜炎。蓄水甚多。以壓迫肺心。亦能使心下堅築而短氣。然肋膜炎當有痛有熱。懸飲之欬唾引痛。伏飲之滿喘欬吐。發則寒熱。背痛腰疼。稍與之相近。而支飲不言痛。不言熱。實不似肋膜炎也。千金之於覆花丸。其所主治之證候。完全是胃擴張胃下埀之病。無所謂澼也。要而言之。隋唐之時。己認粘稠之涏沬爲痰。惟支飲爲心臟之病。餘皆胃腸之證候。未有如金元以後之誕怪也。又以痰之源，皆爲水飲結聚而成。尙與金匮不甚相遠。未有如金元以後之龐雜也。</p>
<h3>中藥西用（續）</h3>
<p>— 周夢白</p>
<p>㈤綿馬（貫衆）adpidium,</p>
<p>本原</p>
<p>本品係水龍骨科（polypodiaceal）植物DiyptorisFilix-masSchott之根莖。及其葉柄殘基。在秋季採集之。將其叢生之根及鱗葉並枯朽部分。除去而乾燥之者。</p>
<p>形狀</p>
<p>本品之根莖。呈圓柱形。亦有彎曲者。往往具有縱長之裂縫。或粗大之葉柄殘基痕。並少數粗大縱長之稜線與溝紋。表面皆現棕黑色。内面則現淡棕色。具六至十二個之維管束。开成不連續之圓圈而排列之。臭微。味初甘而收歛。後苦而辛。</p>
<p>成分</p>
<p>本品之有效成分。甚爲複雜。學者之意見。尙未一致。據包姆氏（Boehm）稱爲綿馬酸。（Fulixsame）有(C35H38Oi12之組成）乃淡黃色細微杯狀結晶。又據郭朗飛氏（Knafi）稱爲飛馬龍(Filmaron係C47H52O16之組成。乃無晶形　黃色粉末。其他尙含有揮發油。脂　油。綿馬鞣酸等。其揮發油。具有綿馬固有峻烈之芳香氣味。</p>
<p>試騐</p>
<p>本品剥去外皮。已變褐色者。爲陳舊品。交力减失。藥用須用其新鮮者。其斷面應呈綠色。本品之根末。不宜現帶黃綠色。本品之灰分重量。不得超過百分之三。</p>
<p>效用</p>
<p>本品爲有鈎條蟲及廣筋裂頭條蟲之驅除藥。效騐極良。惟對無鈎條蟲。不及石榴皮云。十二脂腸蟲。亦有用之者。小兒用其四至五格蘭姆。大人有用至二○至二五格蘭姆者。</p>
<p>貯法</p>
<p>本品容易起分解作用。宜遮光蜜閉。注意貯藏於乾燥在生石灰上之容器中。其剥去外皮及斷面呈褐色者。均不應貯藏。按中華藥典綿馬名下。附有貫衆。意即綿馬與貫衆是同物異名。然查貫衆之原植物爲AspidiumFalcatumS.W.。雖起首一字。與綿馬定名相同。而原植物與綿馬實異。且綿馬是驅蟲藥。而貫衆乃止血解毒藥。效用亦不同。似係同類同科而非同種植物。特記於此待證。</p>
<h3>科學的達生篇（五）</h3>
<p>— 俞松筠</p>
<p>（七）姙娠確實的診斷（乙）孕與病的誤認</p>
<p>庸醫們往往誤指有孕是病，無孕偏說有孕，因此，誤人生命的事實，常常發生在社會上。現在我把這種情形，寫在下面，以便大衆注意一下：</p>
<p>㈠有孕的說是有病···在許多婦人們中，假使月經停了三個月，身體逐漸瘦弱，胃口不佳，睡眠不安，精神萎頓，喜怒無常，但是沒有嘔吐和惡心的表現，連她自己也很疑慮，倘若就診於產婦科庸醫，大都不是說乾血癆，定是說阻經，隨手開一張通經藥方，吃下去眞正靈騐，不出兩天，鮮紅的月經，果然下來了，不過不很暢達，再去復診，於是藥味加重血塊不斷地下來，可是這婦人，經過這種狀况以後，頓時面色蒼白，虚汗虚脫不省人事，這種危險程度，就是變相的打胎，豈不可怕麽？</p>
<p>㈡無孕的偏說有孕···假使三十餘歲的婦人，數年或十餘年來，從未生育，或雖曾育而夭折者，此時月經忽停，也覺疑慮，倘若去請庸醫診斷，往往說她是懐孕，如果兩月後，她的月經又來、嗣後逐月行經一欠，但甚稀薄，仍去診斷，往往說她是老鼠胎，於是按月服用安胎藥十二太保胎散等藥，直迄十三個月或二十個月，尙無分娩的象徴，原來；這婦人的腹部，雖略膨脹，但是子宮如常，並未增大，亦無上述種種姙娠的現狀，這也是一個診斷錯誤的笑話。</p>
<p>（八）產科診察法</p>
<p>產科診察，最須詳明，大都不外下列各法：</p>
<p>（甲）問診</p>
<p>在一個產婦方面的旣往症，及狀態，對於診察上，極關重要，下列各問題，尤其不可忽略：</p>
<p>㈠本人姓氏，籍貫，年齡，職業（或夫之職業）？</p>
<p>㈡父母兄弟姊妹有何疾病，（尤其是結核，精神，癌腫等病之有無）？</p>
<p>㈢本人幼時曾患可病？在產科所注意的，乃是骨症及關節疾，尤應注意軟骨症（即佝僂病），</p>
<p>㈣旣往的健康狀態，注意月經來潮後之疾病？又如關節炎心臟病傳染病等，尤關重要。</p>
<p>㈤月經最初來潮時的年月，及其經過，順序，多寡，持續日數？平常月經，有何障碍？</p>
<p>㈥如系經產婦，已往的姙娠分娩及產褥之經過？</p>
<p>一姙娠　是否足月？有無流產早產及惡阻等患？</p>
<p>二分娩　是否難產？遲速如可？有否出血？是否用過手術？</p>
<p>三產褥　有否發熱？嬰兒的生死？</p>
<p>㈦此次妊娠中的狀况：一末次月經的時日？二受胎時期？三閉經後的自覺症狀？四有無惡心嘔吐症狀？五自覺胎動的時日？</p>
<p>（乙）現症</p>
<p>診察以前，須先檢查全身，注意各種要點如下：</p>
<p>㈠身體之大小：體格，骨骼，及營養狀態？</p>
<p>㈡肺臟心臟之疾病？</p>
<p>㈢下肢是否浮腫？有無靜脈瘤？</p>
<p>㈣脊柱彎曲或其他骨之彎曲者？</p>
<p>㈤尿中有無蛋白質或糖質？</p>
<p>㈥神經系統？</p>
<p>㈦乳房腹部之檢查。</p>
<p>（丙）觸診</p>
<p>觸診是藉手指觸覺的診斷，亦爲診察上之必要條件：</p>
<p>㈠腹部膨脹之程度及其厚薄？</p>
<p>㈡子宮之形狀大小，緊張程度，子宮壁之厚，及子宮底之高？</p>
<p>㈢胎兒各部之位置（如頭臀背等部）？</p>

<h3>肺病雜談</h3>
<p>— 侯光迪</p>
<p>先哲有云。人必自侮。然後人侮之。物必自腐。然後虫生之。以之言疾。更屬確然。肺癆症久爲人類之大敵。人跡所至之境。即此症蔓延所及之地。死亡率居七分之一。譬如四百兆中將有六十兆人死于是症。其數至堪驚人。無怪先進各國盡力于衛生設施。儼若大敵之將臨。必嚴陣以待者。然肺癆菌散佈滿天下。物體也。塵埃也。食物也。痰吐也。糞便也。何莫非癆菌附着之所。人與人交接。人與物接觸。在在有傳染之危險。欲避免之。殲滅之。在事實上殊感困難。雖處處消毒。事事潔淨。然千慮必有一失。恐將無一幸免。第每于一種情况之下。往往此患彼否。此染彼免。此無他。個人之抵抗爲之而已。體質强健。抵抗裕如。病菌即無由入。即不自侮自腐。而外物不能侵之謂也。此其一。至于已患肺癆之人。在全世界人類中。幾居半數。而半數之中。有平時不見肺癆徴象。迨死後搜查肺部却發見結核體。不過生前一度患及。旋即愈復。而死亡原因已非本症。有患癆雖久。仍能維持健康。獲享耄壽者。有病體支離。藉療養之方。得延殘喘者。大抵肺癆一症。不爲不治。全視調養如何。抵抗力之大小。而𢌞異其運命。故療學家頗謂癆症有醫愈之可能。以吾國衛生之幼穉。生活之低下。患癆者幾十之八九。或患　病即瘰𤻤或喉頭結核（喉皮）或關節炎（鶴膝風）或支氣管炎及支氣管擴張等。觸目皆是雖不盡屬肺癆。而爲癆性結核則一。然未見死亡載道。人口銳减。可見天然愈者。大有人在。由此觀之。益信癆菌不能殺人。果被殺者。實與以可乘之機會也。此又與自腐虫之理相脗合矣。此其二。今且論治法。證諸前說。癆症與個人抵抗之關係。已甚明瞭。故治療方針。不外由此設想。第一建造健全之組織。第二充實血球之原質。增加血球之製造。空氣。日光。滋養料。久爲療養所必須。夫人能道之矣。但有一種謬解。亟須糾正者。患癆之人。每以魚肝油爲唯一滋養品。或啖生牛肉。及生牛肉汁。鷄卵。鷄汁等。殊不知多食與滋養。確爲兩事。食而消化。方爲滋養。食而不化。轉成賊害。故服肝油宜于慢性期内。在纖維變化之時。或在肺病初期。如服之于肺組織變壞之時。則惹起消化之障碍。而摧殘食欲。爲害不淺。如將肝油摩擦肌上亦可藉皮膚而吸收此乃替代内服之一法當視患者之狀况而規定其次數。如極嬴弱者隔日摩擦一次。</p>
<h3>診餘閒談（四）</h3>
<p>— 張森玉</p>
<p>戊、罐頭食品及腐敗食物　久藏之食物，質地多敗壞，維他命消失，而又有毒質，腐敗之食物亦然，因有害無益，故宜忌食。</p>
<p>己、薰過與加香料之食品　暫用有開胃之效，久則傷胃，有數種香料，亦能毒害。</p>
<p>庚、肉食應减至極少限度　每日之營養，有少量補充已足，用大量不能消耗，致令人體重而肥胖，而吾人之身體，不欲其肥大，祇求堅靱，强壯，樂於作事，極爲活潑，富有抵抗力等，方爲健全。</p>

<h3>傾銷稅與國貨年</h3>
<p>— 何冰</p>
<p>中國爲國際資本主義銷售商品之尾閭，由來已久。因彼此角逐，企圖獨佔各國對華貿易常出於「傾銷」方式。如戰前英日棉織品在華市塲之逐鹿與夫戰後日本棉織品之獨佔，英不以傾銷政策爲主幹。自資本主義高度發展，而引起普遍的世界經濟恐慌以來，各國力求收支之均衡，利餘商品在華之傾銷，遂益激烈。</p>
<p>傾銷或曰「屯并」，乃英文Dumping一字之譯音。意義至简，普通以某一市塲，另外一市塲之生產者，以其剩餘生產品，用非理性的低價，發售於其地，其地卽謂爲「屯并塲」。換言之，所謂傾銷者，卽某國之生產者，以其本國貨，賤價售於外國；其賤價之程度，或低於國内市塲之售價，或低出成本以下，目的爲壓迫他貨，掠取市塲。輸出此種商品之國家，爲「屯并者」，輸入此種商品之國家，爲「被屯并者。」在輸出國言之，凡以同種商品用各種不同之價格，在各種市塲發售卽爲屯并，是以屯并之進行，不外四種方式，卽：㈠售價低出於國外市塲同様商品之價格者；㈡售價在國外市塲之低賤，競爭者不能與之相對抗者：㈢售價在外市塲低於本國市塲同様商品之價格者；㈣售價在成本以下，生產者無補償獲得者是也。　各國　華貿易之商品，除獨佔估者外，多以屯并之方法出之，其間尤以日貨爲主。日本銷華之棉織品，煤，魚介，水菓等物，均以屯併方法，排斥他貨。就最近言，如日煤撫順，元山，神田，池野各貨價格，莫不一跌再跌，撫順煤原來傾銷價格爲日金四·六○元，最近且跌至二·八五元。其他各貨，類似者亦多。自表面視之，貨物價跌，於消費者有利，固爲輸入國之益；實則有大謬不然者在也。</p>
<p>强國之道，在於國民經濟之發達；欲達到此目的國際收支之均衡，實爲首要之條件。但如非發達本國之工商業，奚是語此。而外國屯并政策，實爲本國工商業發展之莫大打擊也。中國工業尙屬新興，不諭原料製造等各方面，成本皆較資本主義先進國爲高，以之與人競爭，已屬不易；如有同様商品之傾銷，自難存在。吾國之國貨紙業，火柴貨，海味業，紡織業等之不能發達，莫非受資本主義國家傾銷之打擊。歐戰時資本主義國家無瑕東顧，津滬紡織工廠卽紛紛與起，無畏雨後春笱，迨失歐戰結束，卽隨之紛紛倒閉，至今一落千丈，卽此一端，足爲明證。世界各國，關稅絕對自主，對於外貨傾銷，自可高築關稅壁壘，以資限制，此外各依需要，多有取締傾銷法之施行。吾國關稅雖云自主，而非絕對，而對於外貨傾銷之限制，尤爲孔亟。是傾銷法之施行，實爲急不容緩者也。</p>
<p>且也，今年旣爲國貨年，對於國貨之提倡與推進，有賴於傾銷稅之實施者良多。在華傾銷商品，以日貨爲多；是傾銷稅之施行，是爲抵制日貨之一助。此外，俄國亦以傾銷政策名於時，中俄復交後，吾國爲防免對俄貿易之不利計，亦有賴於傾銷稅之實施也。</p>
<h3>集團經濟制度下之四集團</h3>
<p>— 楊克垿</p>
<p>人類以社會組織之進步。經濟生活之範圍亦日漸擴大。蓋以環境的不同，時代的需要。故有各種不同範圍的經濟以適應之。卽至世界經濟，各國從前固不竭全力促其實現，乃至近年來各國又不復趨向於國際經濟之發展。考其原因，約有兩端，㈠世界或國際經濟最要之點，卽在國際間貨物之自由流通，而現在各國名義上固均通商自由，無所阻碍，而實際各有極高之關稅壁壘，限制他國貨物之進口，以期本國貨物在國内不因外貨而受影響，各國以本國利害關係，故均不願犧牲自己之利益，而將關稅减低，於是乃有生產合理化之說，以期减低產品之成本，然以各國之並遍採用生產合理化，成本之减低，亦不足言競爭矣。㈡國際經濟之要，莫過於資本及金銀之自由流通。而過去三年來各國均相繼禁金出口，一九三○年至一九三二年各國均倡匯兌管理以控制資本之流通，其尤甚者，乃有禁止匯兌之事，卽至最近更又採用貿易管理，此種辦法實阻碍國際經濟之前進，而自掘墳墓也。代此而興者爲集團經濟。　　集團經濟（BlocsEconmy）一詞，見於世上爲時甚暫。所調集團就是以一個强國爲中心　這個强國或者聯合隣近的弱小國家、或者束縛她的殖民地或準殖民地成爲一大集團。在集團以内，由高度工業發展的强國，有原料取給的便利，貨物行銷的絕對自由，當然是關稅的壁壘打消，用極有利益的條件相與交換貨物，集團經濟的意義和目的就算達到了。於是乎一個强固的濟集團（EconomyBloc）以内，一切經濟活動的實施，可以自由無碍，指揮自如旣然如此，那麽還用國際經濟做甚麽，現在的高度工業發展國家都走入這一途了。</p>
<p>現在世界上的經濟集團有四個國家爲中心，也就可以說世界的四大經濟集團，我們把一個集團简單的槪括說明一下。</p>
<p>㈠美利堅爲中心的經濟集團，美國資本主義的發達開始於南北美戰時代，她的集團是由夏威夷菲律濱和巴拿馬及收復的古巴·海地·聖地·明各·尼加拉瓜等國而形成，其勢力的伸張，先輸出商事，然後輸出資本，商品的輸出，由一九二二年的三，九七一百萬金元，增到一九二八年的五，三二一百萬金元，資本方面由一九二二年八，○二一百萬元增到一九三二年一五、一七○百萬元、她的勢力不僅在集團以内伸張、并且把英國的加拿大也有拉入集國内的企圖，這個祇要看英國的商品和投資的增加的比率不及英國增加的快，就可以明白。并且對歐洲的貿易和投資額出非常迅速的增加，同時又有巨額的戰債，所以現美國集團的擴張，實足以驚人。感受影響最深者莫如英法，在加拿大與英國的集團發生衝突，在歐洲和法國的集團衝突。</p>
<p>㈡英吉利爲中心的經濟集團，這個集團是由英本國愛爾關自由邦、加拿大、紐芬蘭、澳洲、新西蘭、南菲聯邦等自治領、及印度錫蘭、馬來羣島、直布羅陀、馬葡太其他英國殖民地屬領等而形成，然而英國現在所感受的是殖民地、自治領屬領等和英國經濟關係的漸次脫離，同時又以美國集團勢力的伸張，於是英國貨物的市塲愈縮愈小，投資額在國際投資市塲出漸漸的縮小。英國旣然感受到這種情形的痛苦，於是乎在去年就有渥太華會議的舉行。會議的目的就是在解决貿易和關稅等問題，最後成立了十二個協定，實行新的稅率，南菲聯邦更依據該協定對外的實施禁止關稅，其他各領屬地也都預備提高關稅，這是事實都是英國實現她的集團的新活動。</p>
<p>㈢法蘭西爲中心的經濟集團，這個集團是由法本國，圭尼斯，阿爾及爾等之北菲洲等殖民地，更加上馬大加斯加爾，安南等殖民地而形成。法國的工業發達較英美爲遲，所以輸出的商品和投出的資本比較上少一些，貿易也沒像英美那様順利。大戰以前時常人超，一九二八年時以法郎安定，也是入超，不過有德國賠欵和貿易以外的各種收入、各國的現金於是都集中在法國。一九三二年末法國金之保有量達六百六十六億法郎，與美國并爲世界之冠。對中歐久抱有野心，現在波蘭捷克、比利時都在他的統率之下構成與英美對立之集團。</p>
<p>㈣日本現已成爲世界四大經濟集團之一。不過她的工商業還够有上和歐美競爭。原因是一方面工業後進，由於工業技術的幼稚和資本的不豐富，他方面日本的工業是一個壟斷的局面而已，其貨物的行銷亦祇限於亞洲和南洋。而歐美的經濟勢力向東方伸張，使日本更　緊迫，於是日本先人下手奪取我國的東三省以謀取得永久的貨物行銷地和原料的供給。在我國方面，再由東三省出發而侵佔華北，以完成其經濟集團之範圍，形成一東亞門羅主義，以鞏固其集團，而免與他國之經濟集團相衝突。</p>
<p>在這種情形之下，我國應如何應付，才不至爲外來的經濟侵略所滅亡，這不是工商界一已的　，乃爲吾全國上下目前最重大的責任。</p>
<h3>國難期中之工商業</h3>
<p>— 鳳梧</p>
<p>民國二十一年總結帳已於十日前過去矣，在未結帳之先，市虎頻傳，相驚伯有，良以去年（二十一年）之一年，我國工商業遭遇未有之困難，因有一二八之變，二十年度總結帳，雖迭經延期，實際上仍未舉行，直至去年總結帳期始同時清算，此其間予金融界及工商界以不便者已有在少。再加以世界經濟雖有各國經濟專家殫心絕慮，以求解决。其無如枯澀艱窘，不减於疇昔，失業之人數，祇見其增，不見其减，農工產品之滯銷，依然如故，擁有多量黃金者，積儲因不便，貸放又不敢，適以成其爲黃脹病，缺乏黃金之國，有爲通貨膨脹之結果，物價高騰，民生愈艱，如日本全國生活費指數（去年十二月）竟比前年同月加起百分之四·七，一般勞働階級，旣感失業之痛，又爲生活所困，而各國仍不覺悟，依然關稅壁壘高築，以杜絕其產物競爭品之輸入，一面將過剩之商品。向海外爲銷塲，竭本國之力不足，聯合其他部分協力以圖之，至無可聯合，則不惜師出無名，强占人地，而遂其推銷商品收取原料之企圖，夫各國皆有其實力，非黃金，卽武力，故其彼此間尙不過互相擋駕，無甚大虧，所吃虧者仍爲吾國耳，吾國旣以歷史的關係，不但國防上藩籬盡撤，卽經濟上亦門户洞開，洋貨之不絕輸入，任令滿　金錢以去，而無力挽救，關稅雖云自主，所能保衛我工高業者，仍微乎其微。况各國只求產品得有售主，不論價格之高下，於是舶來之品，雖有金價上漲之影響，仍復如江潮之湧入，本國新興之工業，乃爲洋貨傾銷所　折，不克自廠　况夫自前工廠之製品，多數原料尙有待於外求，則其所能　擴洋貨侵入之力，更屬微　，自一二八之變作，内外貿易旣經杜絕，不料茶之對外銷路，英倫市塲餐奪於印錫，美菲去路，又爲日茶所霸占，絲則市價大落，得未曾有，江浙育　之家，無不咨嗟萬分。出口亦寥落不堪，絲茶兩者旣告失敗，歷年所賴以抵銷入超者爲大豆生仁油餅等類。除生仁外，豆類又爲東三省特產，自經强佔之後，在吾國對外貿易上少此一筆收入，入超數字更爲膨脹，其他賴以抵銷之者復見侵削，國内財富安得而不日見枯緊。此外匪共兵患尙未肅清，外侮侵凌，未能消弭，而我工商業於此　沛流離之中，仍得勉維現狀，至堪欣幸矣。</p>
<p>去年總結帳之結果，錢業秉其臨　深履薄之見，力事緊縮，故其變動甚微，微聞今年往來，又主鄭動，在此狀態之下，自以鄭重爲是，但金融界與工商業如　齒之相依，似應於鄭重放欵之中而積極扶助其發展，庶幾得打破此難關也。</p>
<h3>祁門的『紅茶』與『紅潮瑩』</h3>
<p>— 瑩</p>
<p>中國的茶業，正在日薄西山，快要到沒落的時期了！自然，這不僅是茶業如此，在整個的農村的崩潰中，凡是農產物，可說沒有一種，不受到嚴得重的恐慌！</p>
<p>在三個月之前，我得有機會，費了十餘天的長時間，爬山越嶺，到了中國最著名的紅茶出產地的祁門。祁門眞是窮鄕僻壤，全年敎育費總數不及一萬三千元，而沿途所僅見的某區區公所，内像私塾般的一所學校，學生讀的還是幼學瓊林和神童詩之類的書籍。</p>
<p>但祁門的紅茶，確是一處最適宜的生產地，崇山峻嶺，樹木葱　，昌江横貫西南兩鄕。在早晨的十時以前，滿山滿野，都被重霚籠罩着。茶爲性喜高燥而又須濕潤的，植物，種在傾斜的山上，而又有深厚的雲霚，眞是得其所哉！兩湖江西的紅茶，已被印度錫蘭茶傾軋得業已全軍覆滅了，而祁紅茶還能勉强的在掙扎中，而且如前年，每擔且到過三百幾十兩的最高的價格，這是得天獨厚的原因罷！</p>
<p>祁門製造紅茶的歷史，還不過數十年，在民國前三十六年，徽人余某，以其地廣人稀，茶價便宜，才開始介紹紅茶的製造法，一面而則設莊收買，逐漸地興旺起來的。在當初的市價，都在寗州茶以下。最近數年，由祁門出口的數量，約爲二萬五千担，平均以每担一百元計，則祁門全年的收入達二百五十萬元之多。</p>
<p>以這様小的一個縣份，每年能有偌大的現金輸入進去，這不是國内最的希望最爲富鐃的一個地方麽？而且如景德鎭所出產的名聞中外的瓷器，其原料曰白磁土，大部分也是由祁門所生產，此外木材及其他農產品出產，一年的數量也很大。</p>
<p>說起來可憐，摘茶製茶的男女工人，多數是由外縣進去的；雅片烟館，到處林立；而賭風之盛，則亦爲各地之冠。這倒還無關大局。最厲害的是紅丸子的暢銷。抽雅片烟每天的數量終是有限，吃上了癮，終還能延他們十年二十年的生命。紅丸是由嗎啡海落英等所製成，吃的時候，可以整天同抽，吃上了癮，則無論是最好的雅片也抵不過癮了；而且吃了紅丸以後，不論男女的生育都被停止。據當地人估計，祁門的男子，十人有六七人都已染上了癮，每年單是紅丸一項的支出，約達百五六十萬圓以上。所以祁門人稱紅丸爲祁門的紅潮，（徽音潮茶通）這紅潮不但是浪擲金錢，而且要亡種滅族的。這種紅丸的來源，當然是外國的帝國主義者所輸入；而内地的能够運銷，則當地的軍警，不能不負其全責了！</p>
<p>據說祁門如此，徽州各　出都如此，不過不像祁門的厲害罷了；而其他各省的農村間也是不能例外。那末這紅潮不但在祁門，已蔓延到了中國的全部了！</p>
<h3>在日人侵略下上海市去年之漁輪業</h3>
<p>— 屈若</p>
<p>上海位東海之濱、握工商樞糾、凡在江浙外海捕魚之漁輪、出入營業、類皆以此爲根據蓋寖假而成爲中國新式漁業之中心、每月漁獲價値、雖無舶來品之巨大、然亦不下七入萬元、現下拖網漁輪之出入上海港者、共有入艘、總噸數約一千五百噸、手操網漁輪有四對、（八艘、手操漁輪之作業行須以二艘聯合工作、猶如舊有之對船漁業、）總順數約三百二十噸、其出漁之漁塲、卽在畏江口外之花鳥山東北、余山東北、以及海礁附近、惟亦有駛至不汀島附近、或竟至温州灣外海者、上述數處漁產頗豐、尤以大黃、小黃魚晚、　、　、　、爲最多、次之卽屬帶魚、梭子蟹、島賊、鞋底魚、鯛、白東子、蛇子魚等、茲將各月份出漁塲所、漁獲之魚類、列表於後、</p>
<p>月份　　　　漁塲　　　　漁獲</p>
<p>一月　花鳥東北海礁附近　鮸　鰲鰻二月　舟山　島東方海礁　鮸輝鰲鰻小黃魚　　　東南</p>
<p>三月　花鳥東北佘山東北　鮸鰻小黃魚四五六佘山東北　　　　　小、大黃魚鳥賊鰻七八九花鳥及佘山東北舟山　島東方　小黃魚鰻　十十一　花鳥東北　礁附近　　鰻　　十二月　海礁附近三門灣東方　鯛鮸鰻　　（訪）表中所列各魚、係指其中多數而言、如　　漁獲以最多者首列、下類推、</p>
<p>每年各漁輪出漁次數、通常爲三十次、去年因受一二八戰事之影響、二三兩月、大都全未出漁、七八兩月、又爲船舶歲修之其、故全年出漁、祇有八月、漁獲乃不如前、且尙有因煤冰等消耗品價格之增高、而受損失、故十二家公司、大都僅敷開銷也、</p>
<p>去年各公司經常開支、約共五六萬元、分柝之、船員薪金年計一萬二千元、漁具船具之添置、年計生千餘元、保藏魚鮮之冰、消耗頗大、出漁時裝載之多寡、恒視天候之寒暖而殊、一般在夏季約九萬斤、冬季約三四萬斤、平均每次出漁約需六担、其價格亦視寒暖而差、自一角五分至七八角間、平均每担約値二角五分、故冰之開支、年計四五千元、此外最費者、要推漁輪燃料之消耗、如蒸汽機關之拖網漁輪、每次出漁約需煤五六十噸、每噸價約十五元、年計卽需三萬元、（中華漁輪則用柴油、所費亦近此數）其他再加各項雜用及公司開支等、年支當在二萬元、此爲拖網漁輪公司之大槪、他如手操網漁業、費用較省、去年各公司約開支三萬餘元也、</p>
<p>至去年份漁獲價値、以永茂漁輪最多、惟其價格中尙未扣除魚行代售之佣金、茲列表如下、</p>
<p>漁輪公司名稱　漁輪名　出漁次數　數量（擔）價格（元）永勝漁輪局　永茂　二六七、一四五·八九　七四、一五０·九四聯興漁輪局　聯豐　二八七、四九五·三九　六七、五七四·六０陳家庚公司　集美　五四七、五九四·八三　六七、０三五·三二永順漁輪局　海順　二八七、二三九·三七　六五、七七七·四八茂豐漁輪局　茂豐　二一七、四五二·七四　六一、八七四·六四中華輪公司　中華　二四八、三五九·一六　五六、一八六·０三永豐漁輪局　永豐　二一五、一六八·九五　五四、七三二·五０三興漁輪局　海興　二三五、五七０·八八　四七、０五九·一五福生漁輪局　福生一·二二四、四、０八九·三九　四二、一二四·四０志達漁輪局　達富貴一八　三、七八０·二八　三五、二一七·四六浙水產學校　民生一·二六一、七０五·七二　一六、九四六·五０泰興漁輪局　泰興一·二　三　四八四·九九　三、七八六·七九　　（誩）三興漁輪局之海興漁輪、乃租與江蘇省立漁業試騐塲、出漁時兼作各項試騐、故漁獲不豐、</p>
<p>如上表所示、因受日漁輪侵漁之濫捕、漁獲較往年已銳减、然口外海洋合於行漁之面積、尙廣闊異常、祇待開發耳、與漁輪業最有關係者、卽漁獲出售時之價格、有時不能得善價、蓋上海一埠、雖擁有衆多之人口、然每日海魚之消費、亦祇六七萬斤、故一量數漁輪同時進口、魚價卽爲供求之關係而下落、裝冰鮮船又成羣進口、舶來品如潮湧入、市價必致狂跌、例如黃花魚、去年四月份、最低每百斤祇售價一元五角、平均每斤僅値一分五厘、漁業中遇此當然困難矣、欲謀挽救、在漁輪公司方面、則在漁船裝置無線電、隨時將市面價格報告、使漁輪進口日期、得知所擇、然整個辦法、仍在開闢銷路、如上海黃魚價格暴落、而内地都視若珍品、卽交通稱便如東滬滬杭車沿綫各地、其價格已較增數培左右、故欲謀漁業發達、務須將上海供給過剩之黃魚、輪入内地缺乏黃魚之處、則市價可以調劑、一面設立冷藏庫、如遇魚類進口旺盛、魚價狂跌之候、則儲藏以待沽、及市上缺貨、有難出所藏以應市、則一方可以調節供求、他方亦所以保全漁商自己之利益、</p>
<p>此外吾國漁輪業所感覺日漁輪侵漁之痛苦、不堪言狀、日人每年以數百艘漁輪、作有規模之循環撈捕、致使漁獲漸减、而又時時私運進口、雖海關查禁以及抽收漁稅、然日輪尙時用駁船運入、或捕獲後載往青島大連、再由商輪運來、慣用頃銷政策、恒以最代價格、摧殘吾漁業、卽如去年十一月十七日日本漁輪鶚丸進口、傾銷漁獲四萬八千斤、（大都爲黃花魚）該魚當時市價每担在二十元左右、自被該輪傾銷、魚價卽隆至十二元、入後竟達十元、前年（一九三一）同時、黃花魚最高自三十五元至四十元、彼以中國出產、售諸中國市塲、就吸收我國金錢、每年輙以千萬元計、際此時鞎、能不及早注意以謀挽救乎、</p>
<p>去年漁輪業雖形不振、然泰興漁輪局尙於十一月成立、漁輪名泰興一二號、出漁以來、成績雖形幼稚、然其爲本國興漁業、則頗可佩、深望有資者急起投資於方興未艾之漁業、挽回利權於已失也、</p>

<h3>盆裏的魚</h3>
<p>— 王慈君</p>
<p>在舊曆年關的時候，每個家庭因爲新年閉市的緣故，不能不事先準備一些日用食品。這時，我偶爾在朋友家中看見他們買了一條預備新年煑來下酒的鯉魚。</p>
<p>瓷盆裏滿盛着清水，一條略帶青黑色的鯉魚悠然地在那裏面游泳着；牠那翅尾的擺動，在瓷盆中激起無數的漣漪。立在旁邊的人可以微微地聽得水與瓷盆邊相觸而發出的聲息。魚兒任性地上浮下沉，眼睛裏放出一條略帶紅絲的光波。腮的鼓動與人的脈絡的跳躍成爲和平的對奏。</p>
<p>但是正在這恬靜的光景中，我那位朋友走來了；他下意識地望着那條活潑的鯉魚，臉上現出幽微的笑意；似乎在思索這條魚若干時以後便會供給他下酒。在這兵荒草亂的時候，耳邊聽不到砲聲和槍聲，這有美酒佳餚度新年，這是多麽愉快的事呢！他的笑意自然是人情物理之常。</p>
<p>但我却默默地替這條魚着急：眼見得娘姨不久便會很平易地把牠捉將也來，放到刀板上；用刀背褪下片片的魚鱗。魚感到痛苦了，拚命擺動。那時娘姨便會輕捷地在魚腹面一刀，鮮紅的血液迸出來了，牠還想逃逸，連續掙扎着。但牠的肚腸肝肺不久便都被人丢在一個碗裏了。祇有一股令人難聞的腥氣撲到人們鼻管來。</p>
<p>我默默地想到這裏，在隔室的朋友們的雀戰停止了，發出一陣喧嘩聲。我知道這是四圈完結，調換方向時的情形；假如沒有這刹那的空閒，他們在沉着應戰的嚴重時期，那裏會這般大聲咆哮哩！我也就隨意聽着，心下却湧起另一個念頭：我們這一羣四萬萬文明華胃，和盆裏的魚有什麽區别呢？敵人明晃晃的刀槍，堅銳的砲彈，敏捷的飛機，龐大的戰艦，日夜在向着我們發出狰獰的笑聲，時時在希冀把人們殺個乾淨，而我們這羣待宰的同胞，還自家夥裏爭高低，比强弱；彼此相傾相詐，相辱相打，視敵若無覩；一班安閒自得的文人，都流連杯酒，悠遊竹林，不知憂時爲何事，這個又與魚的游泳盆中，自得其樂，有何區别呢？</p>
<p>陶醉在醇酒美人夢裏的人們呵，請你們聽聽塞北悲笳多麽悽慘，不要老是像盆裏的魚那様悠遊自得罷！</p>
<h3>崇實</h3>
<p>— 何家幹</p>
<p>事實常沒有字面這麽好看。例如這「自由談」，其實是不狠自由的，現在呌作「自由談」，總算我們是這麽自由地在這裏談着。　　又例如這回的北平的遷移古物和不准大學生逃難，發令的有道理，批評的也有道理，不過這都是些字面，並不是精髓。</p>
<p>倘說，因爲古物古得很，有一無二，所以是寳貝，應該趕快搬走的罷，這誠然也說得通的，但我們也沒有兩個北平，而且那地面比一切現存的古物還要古。聽說禹是一條蟲，那時的話我們且不說罷，至于商周時候，這地方却確是已經有了的。爲什麽倒撇下不管，單搬古物呢？實則那並非因爲古物的古，倒是因爲牠在「不抵抗」之後，還可以隨身帶着，隨時賣出銅錢來。</p>
<p>大學生雖然是「中堅分子」，然而沒有市價，假使歐美的市塲上値到五百美金一口，也一定會裝了箱子，和古物用專車一同運出北平，在租界的外國銀行的保險櫃子裏藏起來的。</p>
<p>但大學生却多而新，惜哉！</p>
<p>廢話不如少說，只用崔灝「黃鹤樓」詩以弔之，曰：　　闊人已騎文化去，此地空餘文化城。　　文化一去不復返，古城千載冷清清。　　專車隊隊前門站，晦氣重重大學生。　　日入榆關何處抗，烟花塲上沒人驚。</p>
<h3>蘇小小與白娘娘</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>丨在蘇州省立女子中學講演丨</p>
<p>我今天說的是蘇小小和白娘娘的故事。說書，蘇州人最出色當行；我到蘇州來說白娘娘的故事，豈不是「班門弄斧！」</p>
<p>我所講的蘇小小和白娘娘，和列位所知的略有不同；我以西湖佳話爲藍本。蘇小小，我不曾見過；從前文人騒客都說她花容月貎，那總不會錯的。她當二七年華，天天坐了油壁車在湖堤上逗引遊人；馬上就有許多『豪華公子，科甲鄕紳，或欲取爲侍妾，情願出千金，不惜紛紛來說。』你想：有洋樓可住，有汽車可坐，寫寫意意做大人先生的小老婆，豈不是好？所以賈姨娘來勸她道：『姑娘不要錯了主意，一個妓女嫁到富貴人家中去，雖說做姬做妾，也還强似在門户中朝迎夕送，勉强爲歡。』你知道蘇小小怎麽打主意，她說：『我最愛的是西湖山水，若一入樊籠，止可坐井觀天，不能遨遊於兩峯三竺了。况且富貴貧賤皆繫於命，若命中果有金屋之福，便决不生於娼妓之家；今旣生於娼妓之家，則非金屋之命可知。倘入侯門，······豪華非耐久之物，富貴無一定之情，入身易，出頭難，到不如移金谷之名花，置之日中之市，嗅於鼻誰不憐香，觸之目誰不愛色，······若能在妓館中做一個出類拔萃的佳人，豈不勝似在侯門内做一個隨行逐隊之姬妾？』她梳攏了以後，把千百個男子在手掌中轉，『她若倦時，誰敢强交一語：到她喜時，人方踴躍追陪。······從沒人突然調笑，率爾狂呼，以增其不悅。故應酬盃盞，交接儀文，人自勞而他自逸；却妙在冷淡中偶出一言，忽流一盼，若慰若籍，早已令人魂消，』有一回，孟觀察在西湖呌了樓船，請了賓客，限定蘇小小去侑酒；蘇小小三番四次的推却，孟觀察勃然大怒，要饒她不過，府縣都替她暗暗擔驚。誰知蘇小小一到面前，一顰一語，把孟觀察直喜得眉歡眼笑！後來，蘇小小冒了風寒，生了重病；醫生來看，都說多兇少吉，她的賈姨娘替她非常着急，她却以爲做了幾年妓女，富貴繁華，無不盡享，風流滋味，無不遍嘗；這様早死，留人間一個好的印象，倒是天心有在，樂於成全，她死時只有十九歲。她死了以後，西冷橋頭的枯骨，倒成爲千百年後詩人們做詩的題材，「湖山此地曾埋玉」的哼個不休。</p>
<p>擱開蘇小小不提，且講講西泠橋對面那個壓在雷峯塔底下的白娘娘。白娘娘是一條白蛇，那是大家所知道的；小青依白蛇傳是一條青蛇，依西湖佳話是一條青魚，死無對證，這且不必硬作主張。白娘娘見許宣的時候，是一個戴孝的婦人；旣然是死了丈夫。大可以休息休息，何苦「小寡婦上墳，」見了「小白臉，」惹起「古井重波」呢？她苦苦的逗引許宣，搭船，借傘，請茶，請酒，一心一意要嫁給他；許宣沒有錢養家，她拿出五十兩一個元寳送給他，這元寳還是從太尉庫中偷來的。許宣發配到牢城，白娘娘帶了小青趕到牢城，死心塌地的替他做家主婆，讓許宣過舒服的日子。許宣一面貪戀白娘娘的美貎，一面爲妖怪的念頭所苦；在牢城相信道士的符水，在鎭江相信金山寺大和尙的佛法，一定要迫白娘娘逃回西湖。結末是這様一個悲劇：白娘娘正坐在那裏梳頭，許宣取了法海禪師的缽盂，悄悄到家，乘她不留神，走近他身背後，將缽盂往頭上一罩，用盡平生之力，將白娘娘罩在裏面。法海禪師一到，白娘娘和小青都顯了原形。禪師將她們罩在缽盂之内，拿到雷峯寺前，令人搬磚運石，砌成塔基，壓於其上；後來有許多人願做功德，不多時竟造成了一座巨大的雷峯塔。法海禪師還留了四句偈語：『雷峯塔倒，西湖水乾，江潮不起，白蛇出世。』（未完）</p>
<h3>醒後（舊作之一）</h3>
<p>— 楊幸之</p>
<p>朋友，我又做了一個春夢，看，我現在還是睡意惺忪。我現在還是睡意惺忪，朋友，我又做了一個春夢。·························在夢裏，味道眞的還不錯，但醒後却感到十分的難過。你看，我依然是兩手空空，空空的手裏依然是沒有什麽。··························聰明的人說：孩子，這並不是！這並不是一團死水；到明朝它準會開花，是香，是美，是健全偉大。···························乖乖，這蜜一般的話兒怪好聽於是我又跌入了夢裏深深。如今我是一覺醒了，夢裏的歡欣，倍增醒後的煩惱。；···························但我是一點也不追悔，我當翻轉身兒再來睡。總有一次我得做個好夢，醒來後不再兩手空空。</p>

<h3>時代與愛的歧路（續稿）</h3>
<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>他一面聞着從她的肌裏發出來的香氣，一面聽着華兒子的音樂，！！打打噠，打打噠，！！音樂像在告訴他，kiss她，kiss她！」</p>
<p>他的心頭一急，全身便像失掉了氣力。鶴子夫人的雙頰的色澤也像是蘇維埃的了。</p>
<p>「打打噠！打打噠！···············」</p>
<p>她只是痴笑着反他愈樓愈緊了。他只恨是冷天，身上的衣服穿厚了一點。她的頰和他的頰最多也只是隔着半寸多的距離。她此刻的氣息不是Acetylenlgas的氣味了，似乎又變了另一種Alcohol質的香氣了。他的頭腦到底是理學的，由她的呼吸便聯想到她的消化器官的變化。在未上T茶樓之前，她的胃裏缺少氣素，不夠酸化力，所以發出Acetyenlgas的氣味來。在T茶樓吃過了晚餐後，有了充分的氣素的供給，轉化爲炭水化物的氣味了。</p>
<p>「啊呀！」</p>
<p>他正在痴想，沒有留心到後頭！他的臀部觸着了在他後面舞踴着的一個女性。　　「對不住了！·············」</p>
<p>他向着那對伴侶微點了點頭。</p>
<p>「啊呀！··············」</p>
<p>他認得那位女性是任碩士夫人劉佩珍女士了！他感着一種驚異。他此刻禁不住要望她的伴侶是不是任錦華。但是他只望了望，知道不是了。那個對手是比任碩士的歲數大一點，但身體似乎比任碩士宏偉碩大，像一個巨人。</p>
<p>佩珍像十分不好意思，在這跳舞塲裏碰見他。她只是臉紅紅地回點了首，沒有向他多說什麽話。</p>
<p>普通的電燈亮了。各人都回到自己的坐席前來了。他不免要留心望望任夫人的様子。他不看猶可，一看，眞把他嚇了一跳。在陪她跳舞的那個紳士的身後，立有兩名穿着制服的大漢子，像是他的保　。他想。那個　士到底是怎様的要人呢？何以任錦華又不見和人們一同來呢？</p>
<p>白色電光又暗了下來。換上了有色的微暗的電光。啊契斯杜拉奏出了狐步舞的音樂。</p>
<p>「跳麽？」</p>
<p>鶴子夫人笑着問海泉。</p>
<p>「休息一次吧。······」</p>

<h3>終究是上海</h3>
<p>— 無畏</p>
<p>上海終究是上海，一種昇平的氣象，敵人遺留下來的戰蹟創痕，已不會再在人們腦中映現着，除非是······爆竹聲裏更把去年底霉氣趕走，去年現在，敵人的鐵鳥己不在天空飛行，而來搖惑人心砲聲機槍聲，除非在東北用播音機送來，是不會再振動人的耳膜，人們那裏會想到這是國難期間，祇要不在上海打，管他媽的，至多記憶力好一點的在茶餘洒後。偶然說一聲去年現在眞是逃難時候呢。</p>
<p>汽車在柏油路上滾着，慘綠少年，摩登女郎，擠在車角裏，跳舞塲裏血一般的酒，肉的顫動，情話，音樂，在空氣裏搖盪着，遊藝塲裏鑼鼓喧天，表演着霸王别姬，影戲院裏老闆笑迷迷客滿牌高掛着。</p>
<p>馬路旁尼安燈照耀着，軍樂隊聲和市聲交互的嚮着，大减價的旗幟飄着，改頭換面的國貨大拍賣，老闆。主顧，各自便宜，無線電裏播送着說書，催眠曲，滑稽，人們立在店門前好整以閒地聽着，號久的呌喊聲祇使人們曉得榆關是失守了，而上海呢？終究是上海一種昇平的氣像。</p>
<p>偶然的想起了東北底義軍，於是來一個娱樂的總動員，救濟東北的義軍，雖然，這盛大的會是閉幕了，但跳舞救國，妓女救國，娱國救國，還在進行不怠，所以上海終究是上海呢。</p>

<h3>不寐</h3>

<p>家國方多難，風雲日益侵，客鄕愁不寐，烽火尙驚心，　　廢曆新年</p>
<p>捲地風沙黄入天，河山鼓角振幽燕，國家何日平胡虜，還望新年勝舊年，</p>

<h3>简易的織物纖維檢定法</h3>
<p>— 添影</p>
<p>衣服之原料，大别爲動纖維與植物纖維兩種。通常用者動物纖維如羊毛，絹絲；植物性者如木棉，麻，人造絲。此類纖維非經細察，不易分辨，且目今科學昌明，研求日精，常以相異之纖維攙入，而於織物施以種種加工，最普通者，如漂白，加光，染色，洗濯，等只顧織物之美麗悅目，不顧纖維之有損，使顧客難以辨别，今擇其简易之檢别法，述之於後，以供諸讀者。</p>
<p>（甲）肉眼或用燃燒法之鑑别</p>
<p>以纎維一根，或自織物之一端，抽取若干根，以火引燃之’倘若其發燄黑暗不明，有特殊之不快臭氣，如燒頭髮指爪，且燃燒時遲緩，而作捲縮狀，最後得黑色塊狀灰分者，此乃毛絹之動物性纎維。反之，若燒時所發之火燄，一如燃紙，且燃着迅速，略帶臭氣，結果得白色，或灰白色之非塊狀之灰分者，此乃棉等植物性纎維。但宜注意者，人造絲中之醋酸纎維絲，其燃燒亦遲緩而得黑色塊狀灰分，其與絹毛不同者，祇其燃燒時，並不如絹毛之捲縮。</p>
<p>以上所述祇能辨别織物之纎維屬於動物性或植物性，至於其究爲何種纎維，較難清認，今擇其特徴，以作简易之識别。</p>
<p>絲絹具有高尙而美雅之光澤，以手摸之，頗覺滑潤，且富有强力，其纎維較其他者爲細。</p>
<p>毛類之纎維，較絹絲爲劣，觸於及膚，略感毛茸茸之不快，其質較軟，故所製之織物，不易摺皺。</p>
<p>木棉之質柔軟；以手摸之，較絹毛稍堅。</p>
<p>麻之纖維，剛硬而少羽毛，且爲熱之良導體，其織物，製衣穿之有冷感，故夏季穿者甚多。</p>
<p>人造絲具有强烈而又華美之光澤，帶有粗硬性，浸於水中，其强力減小，較之乾燥時，相差殊大，頗易與家蠶絹絲區别之。</p>
<p>要之，同一種之原料，若因編織之厚薄，粗密，加撚之强弱，整理方法之不同，及其他手續，所得之品質，亦常有異點：故肉眼實非可靠之檢别法。</p>
<p>（乙）藥品之鑑别</p>
<p>㈠以五克一氱化鉛，加於５％之苛性鈉溶液中煑沸，待其溶解後，靜置之。取其上層之澄清液，以欲檢定之纎維投入後，細察之。若此纎維爲羊毛，則羊毛中之硫質與鉛化合成黑色之硫化鉛沉澱，故纎維變黑。絹絲雖亦爲動物性纎維，但不含硫質，故不變黑。</p>
<p>㈡取一試管加二西西之２％苛性鉀溶液，及欲檢定之纎維共熱後，加醋酸鉛，若有黑色沉澱，即爲羊毛，其理同㈠。</p>
<p>㈢絹絲在４％之鹽酸中，二分鐘後，即能溶化完盡：但羊毛祇能溶於５％之鹽酸中，且其溶解亦較爲遲緩。</p>
<p>㈣硝酸，能使絹變成黃色，而後立刻溶解完盡：毛之纎維遇硝酸，雖亦變黃，溶解遲緩。而木棉與硝酸則無色。　　㈤於　之綠化鋅溶液中，絹絲能暫時溶解，毛與棉則存留不溶。</p>
<p>（丙）顯微鏡之鑑别</p>
<p>此法乃最爲可靠，準確，因各種纎維皆有其特殊之狀態，不難分辨。普通用以檢查者，多爲二百倍至六百倍之鏡頭已足。</p>
<p>㈠羊毛这纎維甚粗，而其表皮細胞，常呈魚鱗，或如屋上疊瓦之狀態。</p>
<p>㈡絹絲之纎維較細，並無紋綿·多二根並列者。</p>
<p>㈢木棉之纖維，兩端較厚，有紐狀之撚形，（作螺旋狀）</p>
<p>㈣麻纎維無撚形，粗而直，有距離相等之粗節。</p>
<p>㈤人造絲之纖維，隨其種類及製法之不同。頗有差别，普通多呈扁平，或縱狀溝態。</p>
<h3>神秘的「堂差」</h3>
<p>— 洪水</p>
<p>本來，眞光的學生，每日上最後的一課，好像再沒有心緒去聽講，尤其對於一部分人公認爲厭憎的理化課；何况今天又是星期六的下午，無論在男女生的心懐裏，早已打算回家的，看電影，或是伴了情侶去跳舞狂。即在敎師們，亦何嘗不想怎様恢復他們一週間極度疲乏之精神？</p>
<p>校鐘畢竟是打了，敎室是靜悄悄地只有校工在掃地嗽嗆的聲音。</p>
<p>「喂！今晚隨意小酌去嗎？」理化敎員陳，躺在敎職員宿舍裏的一張小沙發上，自鳴得意地對英文敎員黃說。</p>
<p>「嗯。」</p>
<p>「××酒家的菜，在上海可稱首屈一指！鄙人請客。」</p>
<p>「好，奉陪，奉陪，兄弟一定奉陪」　　雖則馬路裏北風怒號，冷的不可開交；推進××酒家一扇光彩眩目的玻璃彈璜門，那温暖的空氣，顯然内外頓時成爲兩個世界！淺紅淡綠的燈光，美麗的風景畫，柔軟的地毯，寛大而富有彈性的沙發······於是憑空博得每個顧客心靈上的舒適和愉快。</p>
<p>一度點菜之後，早懐「醉翁之意」的陳，已徴得黃的同意，開了一張局票，呌了一個「堂差」來玩。</p>
<p>「晤，勿容客氣的，坐。密斯？···」陳的話語中止了。腦袋裏想那個「堂差」也者，在記憶中似乎是個很相熟的人，但一時總記她不起。并且，這時的她，在他的糢糊的記憶中，變得比較往昔如花如玉般的玲瓏可愛！</p>
<p>「哈哈，來喝杯酒啦」！正在陳的思維中，黃却是酒興大發的扯着她的手臂說。</p>
<p>「不不丨對不住先生，我要走了。」她那忸怩不自然的神態，從這低弱的口音裏帶有幾分恐怖的様子。終於，陳和黃都莫明其妙地望着她跑出去了。</p>
<p>「噯，老陳，怎的這般掃興呢？這個婊子！」</p>
<p>「眞奇怪！『堂差』也會忍痛犧牲？不接生意。」黃沒有聽到陳的回答，輕微地嘆了一口氣。</p>
<p>「她，我似乎認識的。」陳說：「不錯，她的確是我校×級的學生；唉！這様寗不將要破壞我們榮冠全滬的校風嗎？」</p>
<p>「啊？眞的，好不難爲情人也！」黃驚奇似的。陳搶口怒聲厲色的說；</p>
<p>「非開除不行！呃！密斯忒黃？」</p>
<p>「我們要用冷靜的頭腦來判斷處理」。黃不但收住了他本有的笑意，很嚴格的說；「老陳，她何苦做這門下賤事呢？當然受了環境的驅使，生長在這萬惡的社會裏，意志薄弱的人，鮮有不受生活壓迫而誤入歧途者。開除，未免太生觀了。」</p>
<p>「嘿！那末校風當眞不糟嗎？」</p>
<p>「揆情度理，我們也不該來到這「燈紅酒綠」的塲所，萬一事件擴大起來，我們更成何體統？」陳聽此言，若聞晨鐘，俯首無言。</p>
<h3>兒子的學費</h3>
<p>— 顏也</p>
<p>「祥貴哥！一年難得的新年新歲，爲甚茶館裏都不去跑跑？而一天到晚在家愁眉苦臉，你究竟有什麽心事。沒有？我們凡事總有商有量的，不妨和我談談啊！」張阿德見他的鄰居李祥貴新年悶居家中，特地走過去向他這様問。</p>
<p>「阿德弟！年闖方過，學關又來了，難關重重，呌我怎能寛心呢？」李祥貴依然鎖着眉說。</p>
<p>祥貴哥！什麽學關，我却不懂，你說得明白些。</p>
<p>阿德弟！學關還不懂嗎？就是我的兒子學校裏要開學了。早些開學，呌他好多讀些書，固是一件好事，但是一筆大大的學費，呌我怎様給他帶去呢？</p>
<p>「哦！原來爲了此事。」阿德只此一言，竟也接不下話來。</p>
<p>詳貴嘆了口氣道：我也五十多歲人了！日子一年難過一年，我眞要一切不管了。去年的年成你是知道的，田禾雖然收得很富豐·但是麥價這様低，米賤　　文　　拒絕一一八建議又將如何！國聯</p>
<p>得像送人都不要。而我去年一年的事情你也知道，大女兒嫁出去，陪嫁不見什麽東西，然而我已負了一生債了：後進的房子要倒，修理修理又是百多塊錢，你想一家小小户口幹這兩件大事，還能擔當得起嗎？所以弄得幾幾乎不能過年，大年夜的一天，要利息的，收賬的，你來我去，逼得我幾乎要上弔，總算作揖打拱，才把他們一一送出去。這様的難關才過去兩三天，現在又爲兒子的學費逼死，你想我還能寛下心嗎？今天不過年初四，五路日還沒有過，怎好去向人家借錢呢？况且借到借不到，還是一個問題。唉！眞正要急死我了！</p>
<p>阿德把長烟袋深深地吸了一口，接着吐盡一口濃霧，然後開口道：祥貴哥！不錯！你眞個五十多歲人了！不必再爲兒女做牛做馬了！我看你家福生，讀了幾年書，一點也不値得什麽。昨天他在我家，我問他現在還會耕田和車水嗎？他說：這些事我早忘記了。讀了書便連老本行的種田都忘記了，你想這不是笑話？我看他這幾天在家長袍不穿，馬褂不着，什麽穿了洋鬼子衣裳，頭上還戴一個軟綿綿的紅帽子，一天到晚東村西村，跳來跳去，這還成什麽様子？祥貴哥！於老實人只會說老實話，這幾句</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>話你動氣嗎？我却不管你動氣不動氣，我勸你還是給他種田，不要讀書了。</p>
<p>祥貴又嘆了口氣道：我也想不給他讀書，而他偏不肯，呌我也沒有法想。　　「學費要什麽時候給他帶去呢？」阿德又　。</p>
<p>祥貴道：初六就要的。他們學校裏定外國曆二月一日開學，二月一日就是中國歷年初七，所以他後天初六就要動身去了。還有明天一日的工夫，而明天又是五路日，你想我不是要急死嗎？</p>
<p>阿德也長嘆一聲而又問道：那末究竟要多外錢呢？</p>
<p>「學費二十二塊，飯錢三十六塊，佳費士五塊，書錢十多塊，還有什麽二塊三塊的有好多種，總算下來，至少要給他一百塊錢才好呌他動身　。祥貴有氣無力地說給阿德聽。</p>
<p>正在這時，外面跳進一個一身西裝，頭戴紅軟帽，脚穿革履的少年，離祥貴還有好多路，便大聲道？爸爸：後天我一定動身了，學費借到嗎？</p>
<p>祥貴和阿德望了他都說不出話來。</p>

<p>當「九一八」瀋陽失守後，接着錦州又失守了，閘北又告警了，長江沿岸又受威逼了。每一次事變之後，民衆的愛國心，都能繼長增高。當滬戰的時候上海臨近民衆的愛國心，達於沸點，大有與日俱亡之慨；即腹地各處的人民，也無不急起直追，在物質有所供獻。誰謂中國人無愛國心哉！但是曾幾何時，現在又怎様了？天下第一名關，已被敵人搶去，平津岌岌可危；敵人蠶食我腹地的計劃，已開始實現。其嚴重性當不亞於閘北之被佔。伹返顧國人，對之亦殊淡漠；即有表示，亦竟臺無力量。初因舊曆年底，各自忙其所忙；近更麻雀撲克，花天酒地，過其「新年的快樂生活」「九一八」「一二八」時候的國魂，竟無處可招。愛國救國，只有五分鐘的熱度；豈不是亡國的氣象罷？（下略）莊生謹上</p>
<p>編者按：莊君來信所說的現象，確是非常嚴重。我們雖不敢以社會病理家同醫國手自居，當然也不能袖手旁觀，見死不救。經我們商議的結果，作成了下面的脈案和處方。</p>
<p>脈案！「虎逐於後，懦夫可以躍澗」「火焚於堂，婦穉也能越垣」。這種人想跳樑的事實，斷不能與一個運動家的跳躍，相提並論。前者是一時衝動的結果，後者是眞實本領的成績，惟其衝動於一時，所以等到沒有虎逐沒有火焚的時候，就奮發不起；或者因爲剌激過深的緣故　神經失常，連跨越户限的本能也失去。以視有眞實本領的運動家，那就不問了，他能繼續不斷的天天跳躍，日進無疆的進步。我國人民在「九一八」「一二八」時候的血氣，的確屬於一時衝動的結果，所以過後就完了。現在除非南京失守，上海被佔這一類更嚴重的事態發生，怕不易喚起已死了的愛國心。榆關被佔，這種小小剌激，對於用慣剌激品的老槍（中國人）是不中用了。</p>
<p>處方丨我們知道了這種病象的來原，就可以對症發藥。有剌激性的藥物，是斷不能再用，因爲這可以將其原氣戕賊無餘。我們應該培養他的實力，再加以訓練，使他一根根的筋肉，慢慢的粗起來。「組織團體」就是這病的特効藥。所以我們在本欄内極力提倡，而且昨天業餘週刋裏，還做了一篇「如何組織」的文字。你們不要笑我們的葫蘆裏，只有這一味藥我們深信這味藥，的確可以使全社會的各個細胞，充實起來；馴至全身的體魄，變成魁梧奇偉。</p>

<h3>詩禮人家（十二續）</h3>
<p>— 汪仲賢</p>
<p>幼中嘴唇一咂道：『别的都沒有什麽，我只覺得良心上總有此對不起我們老二。』</p>
<p>若華將他輕輕一推，嘴唇向下一披，露出十分鄙夷之色，說道：『哼！好良心！待你哥哥就知道要良心了，我看你的良心早被天狗星吃掉了！我守了你三年，處處用良心待你，今天恨不得把良心挖出來給你看，結果，換不到你半點良心！你哥哥是人，應當用良心對他，我就不是人，可以隨隨便便打發的，你去吧！去孝順你的哥哥去吧！以後不要再來認識我這個沒有良心的嫂子！』　　若華說罷，使勁將幼中一推，把嫀首埋在玉臂裏，伏在箱蓋上，表示她的萬分失望，幼中怔了一會，慢慢的走近身去，搖着她的肩膀，向她哀求似的說道：</p>
<p>『嫂子，你待我的一片好心，我是非常感激的；人非木石，誰能無情？不過，總怪我同你遇見得太遲了幾年，被老二把你先佔據了去，現在他已經把你要扶正了，你們就是正式的夫婦？我們再要做出這種不端的行爲來，非但我對不起他，就是你丨他始終沒有待錯你，到現在爲止，還是委愛低丨好像也不應做對他不起的事情吧，即使把各人的良心問題丢開不說，爲顧全他的體面起見，似乎也不大應該吧！他現在被人扣留住了，雖不至於有生命的危險，而精神上受的痛苦却也不小，我們何忍再敎他在家庭之中又添一番煩惱呢？我受嫂子的恩德，將來自會用别的方法來報答你，不要讓我做有愧於心的事，嫂子，請你饒恕了我吧！』</p>
<p>若華掩着耳朶，不願聽他的話，他還是滔滔不絕的說着，她霍地立將起來，面孔脹得通紅，雙眉緊促，兩目圓睜，看了着實有些怕人，她望着幼中，咬緊了牙關，喘息了一刻，從牙縫裏迸出幾個『好』字來，此時他們已回到幼中的房間裏，他要想逃到甲板上去，若華却將背靠在房門上，使他無法脫身，她發出嚴重的警告道：</p>
<p>『你這様狠心，我今天才知道！你以前常常的引誘我，今天又拿我開心，你好得意呵，以爲我一輩子的把柄都落在你手裏了，將來可以到處宣佈我的臭史，老實告訴你吧，或是一個女人，抓破了臉，什麽事都做得出來，我要報今天的仇，管敎你今生今世永遠不得翻身的日子，你開口哥哥，閉口哥哥，只要我在你哥哥面前播弄一兩句是非，敎你哥哥不認你做兄弟也是容易的事，你等着瞧我的手段吧！』</p>
<p>這一段話，說得聲色俱厲，與剛才的柔婉姿態成了一個反比例，幼中從來不曾看見過她這様生過氣，今天見了不覺毛骨悚然！</p>
<p>她返身開門，想要走了，他連忙趕過去將她一把抓住，她反而搭起架子來了，他只得低首下心的去哀求她，最後她笑着問道：</p>
<p>『這你不能飭是我要强迫你喪失人格了吧？』</p>

<h3>依密爾雅寗斯及其近作「慾潮」（下）</h3>
<p>— 羅拔高</p>
<p>「慾潮」是寫兩性間的慾的獷進的，中間維織着一叚「利己主義」的現實人生。一個德國男子瓦斯托夫愛上一個俄國少女安娜，拚命地在求她的慾望的滿足。爲了自己非資產階級，物質的缺乏常使安娜不歡，便挺而走險以博美人的歡心。</p>
<p>賺錢，在畸形的發達的社會裏是談何容易，就算不難，也不容易塡滿安娜的慾壑。祇有偷，那是得諸儻來而且是得心應手的。爲了這，瓦斯托夫便常享受到安娜妖媚的眼睛，誘惑的微笑，眞個的銷魂了。然而，法網恢恢，瓦斯托夫那能夠在温柔鄕裏永遠地消遙？於是，他便祇有在鐵窗裏面追尋安娜於夢寐裏面的狂歡了。而安娜，小姑居處，無郎不慣，新歡勝舊歡，固願瓦之不即時出獄也。</p>
<p>但是慾，原爲妬之反面，及瓦刑滿歸來，又演着殺人的武劇了。而瓦之代者雖死，瓦之代者又生，安娜的居處固不感無郎，但瓦之出入於牢獄之門便翻輪似地循環不已了。這是潮，這是「慾潮」！</p>
<p>「要和平必須世界沒有女人！」瓦這様說，然而世界怎能夠沒有女人？所以瓦之入獄便無止境，所謂「慾潮」也就如後浪推前浪地永不能平。</p>
<p>「慾潮」就是這様地發揮着，諷刺着，咒駡着，同時，又客歡地描繪着這麽一叚的現實人生。</p>
<p>全劇的對白，有很多幽默的句子，也有很多含着哲學的意義。導演是無可疵議的；女主角安娜史妲也很能夠在片裏發展她的才能：鏡頭的角度很佳；配音，用光都恰到妙處。德國烏發公司的出品在科學上面是無可非議的，更難得是藝術底精進，人材方面的卓特與超羣，像「慾潮」，好萊塢裏出來東西有幾多及得它上。</p>
<p>它將在新光不戲院開映，筆者不嫌詞費，特地把它介紹出來，替影戲院作一回義務的廣告。</p>

<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>看了「天明」以後</h3>
<p>— 湘</p>
<p>「天明」是聯華公司的新出品，黎莉莉和高占非主演，劇情是以革命爲背景的，黎莉莉飾鄕村姑娘菱菱，高占非飾她的表哥，前半部裏菱菱和表情太嫌做作；後半部很活潑自然，比她在「火山情皿」中進步得多了！高占非的表演也很好，菱菱因爲自己受了奸人的毒計，被賣去操皮肉生活，在這種痛苦的環境下，過着不是人過的生活，但是她反因了個人所受的痛苦，而感覺到羣衆的痛苦，使她成了一個新的革命女性，　結果，被捕去槍斃了！美麗的菱菱在臨死的時候喊着「革命是死不完的，一個倒了一個又起來了！」這是多麽有價値的話。</p>
<p>羅明飾的少年團長，因了菱菱的事，使他覺悟到自相殘殺的錯誤，軍閥的罪惡，在菱菱執死刑的時候，他覺悟了！打死了一個軍閥，自己也犧牲了！演來恰合身份，完全是一位愛國的軍官。　　在攝影方面，有幾個鏡頭太不清晰了！但是，菱塘和表哥追着菱菱到溪邊濯足二幕，的確適合美的條件，攝影的手叚很好。</p>
<p>總之，這張片子很有一看的價値，多少可以看到都市的罪惡，人肉市場的痛苦；能夠得到點很好的敎訓。</p>
<h3>觀天明後的感想</h3>
<p>— 玉虹</p>
<p>在這部影片中，很明顯的暴露了一切社會的罪惡，與揭破了社會獰惡的眞面目，在這裏我們可以看見一個有菱田，有荷池的農人，竟不能恃以維生，一個能勞苦，能工作的工人竟爾不能自食其力，資本主義者的威權，足以主宰全廠工人的生死在「怕餓死」三字下毀滅了多少人們的心靈，造成多少黑暗的罪惡，這眞是現代社會的一幅寫眞圖哩！　　菱菱從操皮肉生涯的階級下，向「救大衆」的光明路上奮鬥一直達到她最後的歸宿，她以爲天是明了，所以在就刑時，她還是甜蜜的笑著，但是在我走出影戲院一路的自己問着，天眞的明了嗎？天眞的明了嗎？而最後我覺得天還是沒有明，尙不知有多少同菱菱同様的人在這黑暗盼望天明呢！但是天是不會明的了！</p>
<h3>伊麗莎蘭第病</h3>

<h3>葛萊泰的婚姻啞謎</h3>
<p>— 時春</p>
<p>葛萊泰嘉寳沒有結過婚，是我們大家都知道的，但是近來英國日報上忽然刋載着嘉寳已經結過了婚的消息，眞使我們莫明其土地堂了。</p>
<p>英國日報上說：『一千九百二十四年嘉寳和瑞典名導演馬立茲斯蒂勒MauritzStiller結婚，婚禮在Constantinople地方舉行，儀式很简單，且嚴守秘密，即嘉寳和斯蒂勒的至親密友，也沒有通知，這件秘事雖無人知道，但事情是實實在在的』。</p>
<p>馬立茲斯蒂勒在嘉寳沒有現身銀幕之前，已有很高的名聲，當嘉寳到好萊塢時，十分窘迫，斯蒂勒替她找了個試演的職位，百嘉寳始得展其天才，嘉寳之所以能得今日的榮譽，不能說不藉斯氏之力。所以他們能夠結褵，實在是可能的。但是爲什麽要守秘密？這個啞迷，倒很費解呢</p>

<p>在開始攝「情潮」一片的時候，福雷已經向公司當局聲言辭職。福克斯方面徴求　麥克利和金特萊AlexanderKindland等的同意，都表示不願和珍妮搭當。後來因爲福雷的合同還未滿期，所以完成了這張「情潮」。佐麥克利等所以不願和珍妮搭當的緣故，大家都不明瞭。</p>
<p>福雷去了，珍妮的對角好久不得解决，最後找了個CongressDances中的主角享利葛雷HenriGarato好萊塢議論雖然不敢下以斷語，但是預料不會有福雷般的成績的。將來如何，尙在未定之天也。</p>

<h3>The League of Nations Still Lacks Resolve to Curb Violence</h3>
<p>Results of Negotiations Between Sugimura and Drummond</p>
<p>Rumors of a New Compromise Proposal from Japan</p>
<p>The Nineteen-Member Committee to Continue Meeting Today to Discuss Proposed Principles</p>
<p>(Geneva) Yesterday, during the meeting of the Committee of Nineteen, the issue of sanctions under Article 16 of the Covenant was discussed. Some pointed out that after the League of Nations General Assembly approves the report and recommendations of the Committee of Nineteen, it would be automatically forced to implement sanctions under Article 16 of the Covenant. Some representatives expressed concerns that invoking Article 16 might have serious consequences. Several other countries' representatives stated that there would not necessarily be an automatic implementation of Article 16, as that article only applies to actual war and does not include undeclared war. Furthermore, several representatives inquired about the League of Nations' position if Japan were to engage in military actions in Jehol after the General Assembly adopted the report and recommendations. However, it is reported that no satisfactory answer was given to this question during the meeting. The British attitude remained consistently strong and clear, insisting that Matsuoka's proposal did not meet the conditions set by the committee and advocating that the committee should immediately proceed with its recommendations. However, it is reported that the committee members have only exchanged preliminary views on the recommendations and there is no concrete draft yet. Regarding mediation efforts, one committee declared that there would be no possibility of reopening negotiations as long as Japan insisted on recognizing "Manchukuo". The committee is scheduled to meet again at 10:30 AM on Monday. (National Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Administrative Vice-Minister Sugimura, relying on the authority of Minister Plenipotentiary Matsuoka, continued to negotiate with Secretary-General Drummond in a final effort for reconciliation. As a result of discussions and research on creating a new approach, and in accordance with the intent of the Japanese response, a new compromise proposal was formed, promising maximum concessions for modifications that would cause no real harm. This proposal does not differ greatly in form from the original resolution proposed by the Committee of Nineteen, but expresses the greatest possible concessions within the scope of no real harm. The matter will be submitted to the Committee of Nineteen for continued consideration of reconciliation. Before submitting it to the Committee of Nineteen, Japan must first seek instructions from the Tokyo government to obtain its agreement. Therefore, the current results are only reported to the Committee of Nineteen. The committee will proceed with the agenda according to the fourth item, while awaiting the arrival of instructions from Tokyo, and then submit the proposal to the Committee of Nineteen for consideration as a final effort for reconciliation. The Drummond-Sugimura negotiations, which are of utmost importance, concluded at 7:15 PM. (Dentsu News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) After Representative Matsuoka met with Acting Chairman Drummond of the Committee of Nineteen on the 4th, Administrative Vice-Minister Sugimura followed with a visit, specifically presenting proposals prepared by the Japanese side and making efforts to negotiate. Although the content of the two meetings is unclear, Sugimura immediately returned to the delegation headquarters to attend a meeting of the Japanese delegation's leadership to discuss the matter. Earlier, Representative Matsuoka convened a leadership meeting at Ambassador Matsudaira's residence around 5 PM, and as a result, a telegram requesting instructions was sent to the Tokyo government at 12 midnight on the 4th. It is reported that the telegram requested the government to approve a new proposal drafted by the delegation in consultation with Drummond. The main points of this proposal are roughly as follows: 1) To compromise with the League of Nations, accept the proposal after modifying the wording of the December resolution. 2) In Article 4 of the resolution, "Based on the principles in Chapter 9 of the League of Nations Commission of Inquiry report...", add wording that is consistent with the situation and delete the word "proposals" from Chapter 10 of that report. 3) Add two or three phrases to the last paragraph of the explanatory statement and adopt the Lytton Report in the form of a citation. (Domei News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The main item to be considered by the Committee of Nineteen, which will reconvene on the 6th, is Part 4 of the report under Article 15, Paragraph 4, regarding the principles of recommendation. It seems that the part of the report preceding this, which has already been drafted, will be acknowledged, as no debate on this issue was seen during the committee meeting on the 4th. (Domei News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Committee of Nineteen unanimously decided to convene the League of Nations General Assembly in mid-February. (Domei News Agency, 5th)</p>
<h3>British Ambassador Assures That Anglo-Japanese Secret Agreement Is False</h3>
<p>Britain Does Not Oppose Denouncing the Puppet Organization; Anti-British Sentiment in China Gradually Eases</p>
<p>(Nanjing) British Ambassador Lampson has been in Nanjing for several days. It is reported that the British Ambassador is scheduled to depart for Peiping on the 6th. The British Ambassador has met with Foreign Minister Luo six times in total. Foreign Minister Luo explained in detail to the British Ambassador the anti-British sentiment among the Chinese people caused by the policies adopted by Britain in the League of Nations. The British Ambassador immediately sent repeated telegrams to the British government with recommendations, and assured Foreign Minister Luo that the rumors of a secret Anglo-Japanese agreement were absolutely false. Britain also does not oppose invoking Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the Covenant, and advocates invoking this paragraph in case of mediation failure. It also does not oppose adding a clause in the report denouncing "Manchukuo". Foreign Minister Luo expressed great satisfaction with the assurances of the British Ambassador, who has been working hard to promote Sino-British relations for many years. (Central News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) As a result of Britain's pro-Japanese policy in Geneva, a short period of anti-British sentiment emerged here. However, the atmosphere in Nanjing has now changed and is gradually easing. According to observers, this is due to London's statement on British policy and the discussions between British Ambassador Lampson and the Chinese authorities. It is reported that the British Ambassador has assured Chinese leaders that rumors of Britain siding with Japan are unfounded. Chinese newspapers have been surprised by news from Geneva regarding Britain's attitude in the past two weeks, expressing resentment in headlines and articles. Now, their attitude has also changed. Judging from the situation, the emotional fervor seems to be a thing of the past. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<h3>British Newspaper Denounces Japanese Rampancy</h3>
<p>Without a Strong Country Supporting It, Japan Would Not Be So Unbridled</p>
<p>A Warning to the Government to Clearly State Its Attitude</p>
<p>(London) An editorial in the Sunday Referee commented on the Sino-Japanese problem, vehemently denouncing Japan's ambition to invade territory, stating roughly, "All parties believe that Japan must have obtained strong support in the West, otherwise it could not be so unbridled. The Lytton Report clearly pointed out that the Manchurian incident was indeed an unprovoked attack by Japan on China, but Japan not only did not restrain itself, but intensified its actions. While the League of Nations was discussing the matter without a resolution, it launched an attack on Jehol under the eyes of the public. Jehol is entirely Chinese territory, as everyone knows. Japan, neither sooner nor later, launched a large-scale invasion precisely when the Committee of Nineteen was about to submit its report to the Extraordinary Assembly. It is unbelievable that Japan has no diplomatic support in the West and dares to brazenly implement its policy of aggression to such an extreme. It is regrettable that Britain does not uphold the League of Nations and the League of Nations Covenant to oppose Japan. We have repeatedly stated that this attitude cannot last long. Britain should clearly indicate whether it approves of or opposes the aggressor. International treaties were indeed signed by Britain, and to preserve Britain's reputation, there must be a clear indication. The time has come for Britain to take action so that the world knows that the British people do not sympathize with rampant nations." (Havas, 4th)</p>
<h3>World-Renowned Figures Form Northeast China Inspection Group</h3>
<p>(Paris) Local newspapers report that several world-renowned figures plan to organize a Manchurian situation investigation group to visit Northeast China. Participants include American famous author Dreiser, French famous author Barbusse, British trade union leader Gausybø, German pacifist Schünerer, and communist leader Monsunpe. After completing their inspection in Manchuria, they will go to Shanghai to participate in the World Anti-War Congress, which is currently being organized by Madame Sun Yat-sen. (National News Agency, 4th)</p>
<h3>A Thousand American Radicals Demonstrate at the Japanese Consulate</h3>
<p>(New York) Today, a thousand radicals marched through the financial center of New York to protest Japan's occupation of Manchuria and the warring countries in South America. However, they only carried flags and maintained order throughout. Upon reaching the Japanese Consulate General, Japanese Consul Fujimura invited the leaders of the march into the consulate to receive their written protest and talk for a while. Unexpectedly, someone in the crowd threw a toy torpedo, causing great panic among the bystanders. The authorities immediately dispatched twenty anti-riot police to the scene, but the demonstrators remained calm and composed. After the representatives left the consulate, they dispersed in different directions. (National News Agency, 4th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Seems to be Preparing to Attack Jehol in Three Routes</h3>
<p>Enemy Building Solid Positions in the Area East of Yu City</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Bombing Kailu Tuchengzi Area Continuously</p>
<p>Linyu: The Japanese army seems to be preparing to attack Jehol in three routes: one route from Tongliao to attack Kailu, one route from Yixian to attack Chaoyang, and one route from Suizhong to attack Lingyuan, simultaneously threatening Luodong and seeking opportunities to invade. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to the Border Chinese Official Gazette, the puppet Fengshan Railway has stopped carrying passengers, but trains continue to run frequently. There are conflicting reports as to what kind of troops are being transported. Some say they are replacement troops, while others say they are reinforcements. Although the situation is tense along the Jehol border, it is widely believed that the Japanese army will not attack before the end of February. The airfield built by the Japanese in Tongliao has now been completed, with twenty aircraft stationed there, flying daily to drop bombs within Jehol. According to the Chinese Official Gazette in Qinhuangdao, the Japanese commander there seems to want to avoid misunderstandings. Recently, the Japanese planned to conduct artillery exercises and notified the Chinese military commander three days in advance. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Chengde recently stated that a detachment of the Japanese army's Miyake 8th Cavalry Regiment, consisting of over 700 men, carrying four mortars and ten cannons, arrived in Suizhong from Jinzhou on the morning of the 3rd, and joined forces with the rebel army of Li Jichun in Beipiao, hoping to launch a major attack on Chaoyang. The Geng Jizhou unit of the Justice Army at Jinjiaosi is still engaged in fierce fighting with the Sanjianzheng unit of the Japanese army. It is rumored that the Japanese side plans to first implement the third route of attack on Jehol. The Japanese troops on the third route are advancing from the Jinchao Road to Nanling. It is reported that Li Jichun has been designated as the commander of the third route of attack on Jehol. The Japanese side is implementing a strategy of having Chinese kill Chinese. Therefore, the Japanese side has been sending planes to carry out major bombings in Chaoyang County for several days. The Kailu military long-distance telephone line has been disrupted since the morning of the 3rd. Chengde has sent personnel to repair it, and it is expected to be back in service tonight. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tang Yulin telegraphed to Peiping, reporting that more than 1,000 men from the Japanese army's 2nd Division, Tomon Unit, have arrived in Tongliao, along with numerous machine guns, cannons, and military supplies. The rebel army of Yu Zhishan has recently joined forces with the Japanese army's 6th Division, with about 500 men, at Kailu Daodeyingzi to build defensive fortifications. The forward position is only five li away from our front line. The Japanese Jinzhou aircraft factory has recently transported a large number of fighter planes and bomber planes, which have been bombing the Kailu Tuchengzi area continuously for several days. In the past two days, the vanguard of Feng Zhanhai's Justice Army in Kailu has only had minor contact with the Japanese forces. Our Kailu defenses are solid. A unit under Liu Guitang was bribed by the Japanese and mutinied, but was defeated by our army. Currently, Liu's unit is still fighting against the Japanese on the Jehol border. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tang Yulin telegraphed to Peiping, claiming that a detachment of the Japanese army's Miyake 8th Cavalry Regiment, consisting of over 700 men, carrying four mortars and ten cannons, arrived in Suizhong on the 3rd, and joined forces with the rebel army of Li Jichun in Beipiao, and will launch a major attack on Chaoyang. The Geng Jizhou unit of the Justice Army at Jinjiaosi is still engaged in fierce fighting with the Sanjianzheng unit. It is rumored that the Japanese side will first implement the third route of attack on Jehol, advancing on Nanling from Chaoyang, and that Li Jichun will be the commander of the attack on Jehol, implementing a scheme to use Chinese to control Chinese. (Central News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>Jehol: It was widely rumored in the city here on the afternoon of the 5th that Japanese planes would come to Chengde for reconnaissance. The military headquarters immediately installed anti-aircraft guns at high points along the city to take strict precautions. As a result, no trace was seen. A certain patriotic propaganda group from the south has been showing patriotic films all night, attracting over 10,000 viewers. During the group members' speeches, the crowd was deeply moved, shouting slogans such as "Down with Japanese imperialism," and the atmosphere of resistance against Japan was extremely strong.

<h3>Military Leaders of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian Hold Anti-Japanese and Bandit Suppression Conference</h3>
<p>Cai Tingkai and Bai Chongxi Return to Guangzhou</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Cai Tingkai and Bai Chongxi, after visiting Hu Hanmin in Hong Kong, returned to Guangzhou together in a limousine early on the 5th.

Yu Hanmou said that the authorities of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian have decided to support the central government in a united front against Japan and to suppress the communists. The number of troops to be increased into Jiangxi by the three provinces has been determined, but the units have not been specified and will be mobilized after the central government replies by telegram. He will return to his post in three or four days. Huang Shaoxiong has changed his departure date to the 7th. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Military Department Replenishes Troops Stationed in Manchuria</h3>
<p>Recently, the 3rd Division has dispatched over 30,000 men</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tokyo, 9:00 AM, 4th: The Japanese military department, in order to avoid international attention and domestic public opposition, has not dared to easily dispatch entire divisions, but is using the pretext of replenishing troops stationed in Manchuria with reserve units. According to the Korean Command's announcement on January 31, the number of these replenishment units recently sent to China, in addition to the reserve units of the 8th, 10th, and 14th divisions, which were transported in 24 trains passing through Korea to the eastern provinces, has not yet been mentioned. In fact, these units, including new recruits who enlisted this January, number no less than 30,000. From this, it can be seen how actively they are invading China. Furthermore, the Japanese military department has recently decided to actively replenish the new equipment of various units in Manchuria, in order to ensure that even small units have the ability to fight independently.

<h3>Matsuoka Talks to British Reporters, Threatening the Great Powers with the Red Scourge</h3>
<p>Firmly States That He Will Not Abandon the Puppet State</p>
<p>(London) The Sunday Times published excerpts of an interview with Matsuoka, Japan's chief representative to the League of Nations, by the newspaper's Geneva correspondent, following the Committee of Nineteen's rejection of Japan's recent reconciliation proposal. Matsuoka said that if Japan is forced to withdraw from the League of Nations, the blame does not lie with Japan. Western powers are ignorant of the situation in the Far East. Japan may therefore withdraw from the League of Nations. He and League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond both believe that reconciliation is the only way to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute. Japan is prepared to continue informal negotiations regarding the wording it must adopt. Japan intends to raise new issues before the Committee of Nineteen submits its recommendations to the League of Nations General Assembly. Japan will not tolerate any plan that considers "Manchukuo" to be an autonomous organization under the protection of the great powers. If the League of Nations ignores the facts and attempts to implement the sanctions stipulated in Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, the result will be a second world war. Japan must now deal with the issue of Soviet intrusion into the interior of China. Is it China or Japan that will conclude an agreement with the Soviets? The League of Nations has almost forgotten this question. Japan does not want Bolshevism to intrude into the Far East. He personally fears that one day China will be divided, even more tragically than today. Japan is acting on this view, believing that if Japan does not participate in the affairs of the Asian continent, chaos will inevitably occur. (Reuters, 5th)</p>

<h3>The Obscurity of the Military Opposition Between Japan and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Although China and the Soviet Union have resumed diplomatic relations, which are merely ordinary diplomatic relations, there has not always been a close understanding between China and the Soviet Union or an active approach to maintaining peace in the Far East. However, the establishment of such general diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union is sufficient to affect the overall situation in the East. We certainly do not hope to gain any benefits by chance. However, from the standpoint of Japanese imperialism, it is believed that the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union is sufficient to gradually lead to an understanding between China and the Soviet Union in a negative direction. At the very least, it can promote trade and, in a positive direction, shatter the delusion of Japanese warlords invading the mainland. Therefore, the Japanese military is doing its best to slander our country, saying, "After the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union, China will be completely enveloped by red forces." And also saying, "In order to prevent China from becoming red, Japan will not hesitate to send troops to maintain peace." It is not known that even if Japan and the Soviet Union can sign a non-aggression treaty, there will be no special military or political alliance. However, Japan and the Soviet Union still maintain diplomatic relations and general commercial exchanges.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the establishment of the so-called "Manchukuo Puppet State," Japan had to make slight concessions to the Soviet Union in order to gain international support, hoping that the Soviet Union would genuinely recognize the "Manchukuo Puppet State." Then the Japanese militarists would make the fake become real, which would be the initial step in the success of their continental policy. Unfortunately, the Soviet Union watched quietly from the sidelines, making it difficult for Japan to play its tricks. Although there were repeated reports of an understanding between Japan and the Soviet Union, they ultimately failed to reach an understanding. First, the two countries were fundamentally incompatible in terms of ideology. Second, although the past of the Russo-Japanese War has become a historical old account, the animosity between the two nations has become even more pronounced due to the aggression of Japanese imperialism. Third, the development of the so-called "continental policy" is not only detrimental to China but will also soon extend to Siberia. Even if the Soviet Union loves peace, there will eventually be a day when it cannot endure it any longer.</p>
<p>Japan is the only independent empire in the Far East and the strongest power in the Far East. Recently, it has abandoned its parliamentary politics and exposed the mask of liberalism, becoming a thorough military dictatorship. It is beautifully named "loyalty to the emperor and patriotism," but in reality, it is for the benefit of a few people, oppressing the hardworking common people in the country more than in the past. Comparing this with the Soviet Union, their different tendencies are diametrically opposed. The more they try to understand each other, the farther apart they become, and the conflicts of interest become even more severe. Moreover, the old account of the Russo-Japanese War has been fundamentally changed in the Soviet Union, leaving no trace. In Japan, at least, they are still preparing at all times and actively preparing because after the Russian Revolution, their strength was reduced and they were unable to deal with foreign countries, so Japan could rest assured. However, from the New Economic Policy to the completion of the Five-Year Plan, the once sluggish Soviet Union has now become a world power, advancing towards its ideal of socialism. Even under the siege of capitalism, it is not discouraged. Seeing this situation, the Japanese warlords envy the long-term progress of others and hate their own daily decline. In contrast, the only way to save themselves is to fight desperately. Therefore, from the invasion of Liaoning and Jilin, it extended to northern Manchuria, and it even wanted to sweep along the China Eastern Railway line and approach the Soviet border. It even wanted to use the development of Siberia as one of the exchange conditions for signing a non-aggression treaty. Even if the Soviet Union is extremely tolerant for the sake of peace, how can it allow Japanese imperialism to act arbitrarily? Therefore, Stalin's speech to the plenary session of the Central Executive Committee of the Communist Party stated, "The refusal of some neighboring countries to sign non-aggression treaties and the changes in the situation in the East have forced some factories to turn their wheels to manufacture new types of defensive weapons..." And on January 15, Minister of the Army Araki Sadao declared that Japan's air force strength was equivalent to that of the Soviet Union. Therefore, Soviet Military and Naval Affairs Commissar Voroshilov also publicly declared, "The current Red Army of the Soviet Union is very different from the Red Army of 1928... In the future, they will be able to fulfill their responsibilities. Under no circumstances will they allow invaders to step into the Soviet Union's borders..." From the above two, it can be seen that the Soviet Union has already made full preparations and has stated that it will never give in easily.</p>
<p>Since the opening of the 64th Diet in Japan, members have felt very tired of general politics, but they have all been full of vigor and energy for the military budget, raising their hands in approval. Despite the country's poverty and the people's destitution, it is still actively increasing military spending. The army and navy expenditures account for 40% of the country's treasury expenditure. In addition to extending the length of conscription service, the army has also added two tank car regiments. The state of active war preparations cannot be concealed. What's more, Mizuno Rentaro, a member of the House of Peers (who has served as Minister of Home Affairs and now has considerable deep relations with the military), recently stated in the Diet that "the Soviet Union has recently changed its Five-Year Plan and is actively strengthening its national defense, which is tantamount to targeting Japan. Japan's air force capabilities are not yet sufficient to meet the needs of the country, so it is appropriate to establish a separate aviation department..." And Minister of the Army Araki's reply was, "Japan's aviation fever has reached its peak. The military budget has allocated a portion for the use of the youth flying corps... Even if there is an air battle, the people will be able to defend themselves..."</p>
<p>The tension between Japan and the Soviet Union in terms of military preparations has reached the point where they are ready to strike. However, they are all loyal to the country. No matter what they do, they do not fail to put the country first. Looking back at our country's people who are drunk with life and dreaming of death, can they not have something to warn themselves?</p>

<h3>Red Bandits Stream into Fujian</h3>

<p>(Nanchang) The Third Aviation Team has been flying daily over eastern Jiangxi and northwestern Fujian for reconnaissance and bombing. From the air, the planes overlook Nanfeng, Lichuan, Zixi, to Jianning, Ninghua, and Zhangcun areas. In groups of three or five, bandits are entering Fujian from west to east, vying to hide in the forests to avoid death. The pseudo 135th Army Corps, avoiding the front in Jinxi after the battle, suddenly launched a counterattack from the Fujian border towards Yushubu, Po圩, Houchu, and Zhuliang, attempting to flank our advancing troops and cut off our connection between Linchuan and Jinxi, and defeat them one by one. However, we were prepared and have already repelled the bandits. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Peng Dehuai and Fang Shao have implemented a merger, combining the Jiangxi-Northeast bandits' troops and local guerrillas to form the pseudo Workers' and Peasants' Army's Jiangxi-Northeast Military Region.

<p>(Nanchang) After the cessation of military action, Fang and Shao reorganized. The pseudo unit planned to consolidate the Jiangxi-Northeast bandits and the pseudo guerrillas from various counties to form the pseudo Workers' and Peasants' Army's Fujian-Zhejiang-Jiangxi Military Region, with Tang Zaigang as the pseudo Commander-in-Chief, and a pseudo headquarters set up in Zhoufang, north of Guixi County. Another new bandit troop regiment was formed and stationed in Gewan, north of Hengfeng. Bandit Fang Zhimin was appointed as the pseudo Chairman of Jiangxi-Northeast Province, bandit Shao Shiping as the Director of the Political Department of the pseudo Bandit Headquarters, and bandit Zhou Jianping as the Commander of the pseudo Tenth Army. They also coordinated with a part of bandit Peng Dehuai's forces, echoing each other. Our army has now agreed with the stationed troops on the Zhejiang border to jointly suppress the bandits and strike directly at the bandit nests. Commander Chiang yesterday instructed Liu Yongyao and Lou Jingyue to represent the慰问 of wounded soldiers in bandit suppression and issued awards. (5th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) When the Zhu and Mao bandit gangs retreated towards the Fujian border after the cessation of military action, they were followed and pursued by our troops. The bandit leaders then forced a part of them to retreat back to Jingu, attempting to contain our pursuing troops so that they could escape leisurely. After being severely attacked by our Luo Zhuoying's troops near Huangshidu, the bandits still retreated along the original route. Currently, there are no bandit traces in the Huangshidu area.

<h3>Capital Journalists Association Issues Declaration on the Liu Case</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Capital Journalists Association declares that the national crisis is serious, with internal communist disasters waiting to be cleared and external Japanese aggression not yet ended. If the rule of law is not strictly enforced and human rights are not guaranteed, how can internal peace be achieved and external aggression resisted? However, Gu Zhutong violated the Provisional Constitution, trampled on human rights, ruined the supervisory system, despised government decrees, and hindered freedom of speech, deliberately disregarding human life. On July 27, 1932, he falsely accused the "Iron Plough" and other articles published in the supplement of the Zhenjiang Jiangsheng Daily of inciting class struggle and containing communist overtones and various hidden words, and ordered the local Public Security Bureau to illegally arrest Liu Yusheng, the manager of the newspaper, and ordered the newspaper to cease publication. The next day, he suddenly transferred him to the Martial Law Headquarters for handling, citing the Provisional Martial Law Regulations of Jiangsu Province. The legal basis was inconsistent before and after, which was obviously a deliberate framing. He was detained at the Martial Law Headquarters for nearly half a year. He was neither handed over to the court for trial nor allowed to view the case files when the Supervisory Yuan sent personnel to review them. The Association, at the beginning of the Liu case, sent Directors Qi Gongheng and Hu Dagang to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for questioning. The person in charge of the government evaded making a definite reply and refused the request for bail. Moreover, when the Supervisory Yuan was submitting a request to the National Government to hand over the chairman for disciplinary action, the chairman disregarded laws and decrees, persisted in his evil ways, and actually executed him on the morning of January 21 this year on the charge of propagating communism and betraying the Party and the country. Such arbitrary addition of charges is no different from the atrocities of warlords. If we do not denounce him according to the law, strictly punish him severely, not only will news reporters be in danger, but also the people of the whole country will be in constant terror. The national discipline will be completely destroyed, and the social order will never be at peace. In order to maintain the laws and decrees, protect civil rights, jointly face the national crisis, achieve internal peace and resist external aggression, the Association has to denounce him according to the purpose of hating evil as an enemy and punishing one to warn a hundred, to prevent others from emulating him. It is not only to seek justice for the deceased Comrade Liu, but also to save ourselves. We hope that all sectors of the country will rise up in anger and make an unfair cry together, to fulfill our duty to protect the law. The country is fortunate, and the whole people are fortunate. This is the declaration. (5th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Wang Jialie Cables that the Guizhou Affair Has Ended</h3>
<p>Another Message Says It Is Difficult to Be Optimistic</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Jialie telegraphed Beijing that after Jiang Zaizhen withdrew to Tongzi, he handed over more than 300 men under his command to Regiment Commander Zhao Xingjian of the Liao Division for reorganization. The Wu, Wei, and Liu brigades on the west road were reorganized by the Bai Division and will be completed soon. With the northwest routes settled, the remnants of the Che unit on the east road will be easier to submit. Mao Guangxiang led soldiers to retreat to Wenshui Guandian, where they were disarmed by the Hou Zhitian Division and escorted out of the territory. It is heard that he has gone to Chongqing for rest and recuperation. No news of the Guizhou affair. You Guocai led soldiers to Chongqing. The Guizhou affair has come to an end. However, according to ethnic news, Wang Jialie's troops re-entered Guiyang. The strength of Wang's troops, except for the two regiments of He Zhizhong, the two regiments of the Jian Wenbo Brigade, and a part of the Liao Division, actually only amounted to five regiments, with only about 6,000 guns. The strength of Mao's troops included three regiments of Jiang Zaizhen, three regiments of You Guocai, three regiments of Che Mingyi, and two regiments of Shou Song, with more than 10,000 guns, but they were not as sharp as Wang's troops. Mao and You's troops were stationed in various places, and it would take time to mobilize and concentrate them, so they were not as strong as Wang's full five regiments. Guiyang is strategically vulnerable and offers no natural defenses. Gains and losses are irrelevant. Although Mao and You withdrew from Guiyang, their strength has not disappeared. Now that Wang has re-entered Guiyang, Mao and You will definitely not give up. Moreover, Wang's personality is stubborn and he has lost the faith of the masses. Therefore, the political situation in Guizhou is still difficult to be optimistic. The Party affairs in Guizhou Province are very lax, with only three or four counties out of dozens of counties in the province preparing to establish county Party headquarters. (5th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Central Question of Japanese Politics: The Saito Cabinet and the Issue of Succession</h3>
<p>The Return to Constitutional Normality?</p>
<p>Or the Continuation of an Emergency Cabinet?</p>
<p>The Shijie News Agency reports that the fate of the Japanese Saito Cabinet will come to an end after the close of the Diet, which is virtually an indisputable fact. What form the succeeding cabinet will take is the central question of Japanese politics.</p>
<p>The House of Peers Eager to Have a Go. According to a Tokyo dispatch, the leaders of the House of Peers Research Association, while outwardly maintaining an extremely calm attitude towards the political changes after the end of the Diet, are in reality paying close attention and are greatly concerned about the developments of the political situation. The reason why the leaders of the Research Association have not been very active during the frequent political crises of recent years is because they learned a bitter lesson from the experience of the Kiyoura Cabinet era and have temporarily retreated. Now that the opportunity has arrived, their covert activities to try to reverse the declining momentum of the House of Peers in recent years are an undeniable fact. Therefore, although they outwardly maintain a calm attitude towards the changes after this Diet, they are in fact considering countermeasures in anticipation of all possible scenarios.</p>
<p>Observations from the Research Association. According to recent observations from people in the leadership of the Research Association, the Saito Cabinet will inevitably resign en masse after the Diet if it finds a suitable opportunity and reason. This is undeniable. As for the succeeding cabinet after the resignation, there are no more than the following three possibilities: ㈠ A political party cabinet based on the return to constitutional normality; ㈡ The emergence of a second national unity cabinet in the sense of continuing in an emergency. Regarding the former, there is no doubt about the organization of a Seiyukai cabinet. Regarding the latter, there are the rumored Utagaki cabinet, Uchida cabinet, and Hiranuma cabinet. Among them, the Hiranuma theory has gradually subsided, while Utagaki and Uchida both have their strengths and weaknesses, making it difficult to decide. Not only that, but the Seiyukai has no room to continue supporting a transcendent cabinet, so the feasibility of such a cabinet is also extremely lacking. As for ㈢, it would be a coalition cabinet composed of the Seiyukai, Minseito, House of Peers, and other factions with Suzuki as prime minister. However, because the Seiyukai is an absolute majority party, this type of cabinet also lacks the possibility of realization. Based on this, the most promising successor to Saito's cabinet will ultimately be a Seiyukai single-party cabinet that returns to constitutional normality. However, if a Seiyukai single-party cabinet emerges, there is a risk that the confrontation between political parties will deepen again.</p>
<p>The Seiyukai Deals with Things from All Sides. Furthermore, it is reported that the Seiyukai expects to smoothly receive the current cabinet and political power after the end of the Diet. Therefore, in the Diet, it is avoiding contact with fatal issues for the government. Also, in view of the Yamamoto cabinet supported by the military, the fascist cabinets of Hiranuma and Mutō, the Saito-extending cabinets of Kiyoura and Uchida, and the Utagaki cabinet centered on the House of Peers, all secretly interfering with the emergence of a Seiyukai cabinet, the Seiyukai is actively seeking various countermeasures against this. Regarding General Ugaki, recently, a movement to remove the governor-general has been launched in the Governor-General's Office due to the judicial officer issue. The Seiyukai is taking the opportunity to launch a fierce attack on General Ugaki to prevent his future rise.</p>
<p>The Minseito is Determined to Not Give Way. Furthermore, it is reported that the Minseito, in view of the recent political situation, has heard rumors that Saito and Suzuki have already reached a tacit understanding on the smooth transfer of political power, and that Finance Minister Takahashi will resign from his post after the end of the Diet, forcing the current cabinet to resign en masse. Therefore, it has been actively engaging with the Seiyukai and other parties to prepare for a situation advantageous to its own party.</p>
<h3>Japan's Black Dragon Society Promotes Aggressive Ideology Towards China</h3>
<p>Holding a Memorial Service for Aggressive Chinese Rogues</p>
<p>A Chinese Allied Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 5th states that the Budo Club recently, mainly consisting of five fascist groups such as the Black Dragon Society and the East Asian Common Culture Society, has scheduled a "Memorial Service for Chinese Rogues" at the Hibiya Public Hall on Japan's National Foundation Day on the 11th, with Mitsuru Toyama as chairman of the conference. Participants include the Homeland Soldiers Association, youth groups, women's associations, fire brigades, and Boy Scouts. In addition to reporting at the conference that the three northeastern provinces have become Japanese territory and that the mission of the aggressive Chinese rogues has been accomplished, they also resolved to send a telegram to Geneva representative Matsuoka, encouraging the Japanese delegation to persevere to the end; otherwise, they could withdraw from the League of Nations and return to their country as soon as possible, in order to comfort the souls of countless aggressive Chinese rogues in the afterlife.</p>
<h3>The German Political Situation is Still Precarious, with All Parties Attacking Hitler</h3>
<p>A National News dispatch from Berlin on the 4th states that the German political situation is still precarious because the Catholic Center Party, the Democratic Party, the Social Democratic Party, and the Communist Party have united to make things difficult for the new government. The new government is exerting its power under the constitution and any emergency decrees that the president may issue to deal with the opposing parties.</p>
<p>A National News dispatch from Berlin on the 4th states that to consolidate its position in the administration, the German government today announced several important appointments. For example, Economics and Agriculture Minister Hugenberg will concurrently serve as acting Prussian Agriculture Minister, National Socialist Party member Rust will serve as acting Prussian Education Minister, Nationalist Party leader Fang Luotaiming will serve as Food Vice Minister, and Nationalist Party member Bangs will serve as Economics Vice Minister. These two men are both long-time friends of Hugenberg.</p>
<h3>Hitler Seeks to Re-elect the Prussian Parliament</h3>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from Berlin on the 4th states that the new Prime Minister Hitler's plan to hold general elections for the Reichstag and the Prussian Parliament on March 5th has been thwarted. The Prussian Parliament has rejected the National Socialist Party's proposed dissolution resolution by a vote of 214 to 196. The three-member committee composed of the Prussian Prime Minister, the Speaker of the Prussian Parliament (National Socialist Party), and the Mayor of Cologne (Center Party), empowered by the Hitler government to dissolve the parliament, also rejected the dissolution order by a vote of two to one. The Hitler government is now considering how to implement its desire to dissolve the Prussian Parliament without violating the constitution. Although the Prussian Parliament has now rejected the dissolution, it is expected that the Hitler government will proceed in other ways. The original acting administrator of Prussia, who supported Hitler, has now taken the first step in dissolving the parliament, having ordered the immediate dissolution of the municipal councils throughout Prussia, with new elections scheduled for March 12th. The Hitler government hopes that by this method, it can occupy a majority in the municipal councils and thus a majority in the Prussian Administrative Council, which will then be able to dissolve the parliament. Before the vote in the Prussian Parliament today, the meeting was extremely turbulent. Social Democratic Interior Minister Severing was angrily denounced by National Socialist Party members as a traitor and criminal to the workers. The meeting was suspended twice before the vote was held. The Hitler government is still engaged in temporarily banning the publication of Social Democratic and Communist newspapers throughout Germany, claiming that the newspapers have recently wantonly insulted the government and published various slanders about the government's administration. Therefore, it intends to use emergency decrees to implement stricter punishment and regulation ordinances than those issued by Papen during his tenure.</p>
<p>A National News dispatch from Berlin on the 4th states that German Prime Minister Hitler, accompanied by Defense Minister von Blomberg, attended a banquet hosted by Army Commander-in-Chief von Hammerstein. Hitler delivered a speech detailing the principles of his policies, focusing on the people's attitude toward national defense issues and the army's readiness to defend the rights of the nation and the people at any time.</p>
<h3>The French Government is Also Unstable, with the Possibility of Herriot Rising Again</h3>
<p>A National News dispatch from Paris on the 4th states that although the new Daladier cabinet in France has won a vote of confidence in the National Assembly, commentators still predict that the Daladier cabinet will not last long. Most French newspapers believe that the Socialist Party's recent sudden tilt toward the government is a temporary strategy to mend the rift in the left wing, and does not represent genuine support for the government's financial constraints. As for who will succeed Daladier, it is widely believed that Herriot will rise again to form a national concentration cabinet, which is an unavoidable fact.</p>
<p>A Havas dispatch from Geneva on the 5th states that French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour arrived here this morning and will speak with the leaders of several delegations. In the evening, he will prepare a draft speech to be delivered at the General Commission of the Disarmament Conference tomorrow afternoon.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Hindenburg's Resignation</h3>
<p>A Havas dispatch from Berlin on the 4th states that foreign news reports that President Hindenburg has already resigned. Semi-official sources have firmly denied this report.</p>
<h3>A Professor at the Paris Military Academy Spies on Italian Military Secrets</h3>
<p>Sentenced to Five Years in Prison</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from Rome on the 3rd states that Idos, a professor at the Paris Military Academy, and his personal secretary, Ms. Bonifond, were charged today with espionage near the border. It is said that the professor arrived in Tarvisio last August, after which he went to the Yugoslav border to investigate. Their secretive movements aroused suspicion, and they were arrested on October 4th. At that time, cameras, telescopes, and detailed maps of bridges and roads were seized. The professor claimed that the purpose of his visit to Italy was to obtain military information that France wanted to know. Ms. Bonifond claimed that she was not involved in the professor's actions but admitted to having participated in the professor's investigation and taking photographs. According to the law, the crime of private espionage is punishable by fifteen years in prison, but in Idos's case, it is not very serious and may be reduced.</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from Rome on the 4th states that the trial of Idos, a professor at the Paris Military Academy, and his personal secretary, Ms. Bonifond, on charges of espionage of military secrets, was completed today by a special court. The prosecutor asked that Idos be sentenced to fifteen years in prison and the secretary to ten years, saying that the professor came to Italy every year to report the secrets of Italian military preparations he had seen to foreign countries. The professor has admitted that he was entrusted by a friend in the Parisian military to come here to investigate secrets. Idos did not disclose the name of the friend and vehemently denied having received money from the friend. The court sentenced Idos to five years in prison and his secretary, Ms. Bonifond, to three years and four months. However, Idos was granted a general amnesty in Italy, so his sentence was only two years. He has already been in prison for five months and must now remain in prison for nineteen months. Ms. Bonifond will be released immediately as a result of the amnesty.</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from Paris on the 5th states that the trial of Professor Idos and Bonifond has aroused great attention in France and elsewhere, and it is considered regrettable that this case occurred at this time because French diplomat Yvon Delbos is scheduled to go to Rome at this time to seek closer relations between France and Italy.</p>
<h3>Einstein Leads Germans to Fight for Freedom of Speech</h3>
<p>A Havas dispatch from Berlin on the 5th states that a meeting to demand freedom of speech will be held in Berlin on February 18th.

Among the celebrities hosting this meeting are the famous mathematician Professor Albert Einstein, writer Heinrich Mann, and his brother Thomas Mann.</p>
<h3>The Issue of a Japanese-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty (Tokyo Correspondence) (Continued)</h3>
<p>The Opinions of Those Who Support It Deserve Attention</p>
<p>Two. Luring Soviet Russia to recognize "Manchukuo". Since Japan fabricated the puppet state of Manchukuo, it has found no country to recognize it except to proceed to recognize it. On the one hand, the United States has adopted the traditional open-door foreign policy. On the other hand, the countries centered on the League of Nations regard "Manchukuo" as a puppet fabricated by the Japanese warlords and refuse to recognize it. In the end, "Manchukuo", which the Japanese warlords have painstakingly sculpted for a long time, cannot obtain any international status. Therefore, Japan is now deeply considering how to lure any country that can agree with Japan and give formal recognition to "Manchukuo" in its isolated international situation. Of course, the best country to agree and recognize is a strong country in the East. If a country that has a direct stake in "Manchukuo" formally recognizes it, the impact will be simply indescribable. In this case, the only country that meets this condition is Soviet Russia, which occupies the north and can influence the global situation. Advocates of the conclusion of a Japanese-Soviet non-aggression treaty say that if "Manchukuo" is recognized by Soviet Russia and the three countries of Japan, Manchukuo, and Russia cooperate with each other to a considerable degree, then the other countries will come together to recognize "Manchukuo." Even if this is not the case, it will not hinder the overall situation. At that time, Japan will have enough spare capacity to observe the internal and external situation and quietly wait for the international political situation to improve. Although it is still blocked in its isolated position, it can cope with it with a lasting attitude.</p>
<p>Three. Getting rid of the isolated international situation. Like shooting stars, the United States and Russia are two major countries freely roaming outside the League of Nations circle. Among these two major countries, the United States has always silently watched Japan's invasion of Manchuria. As for Soviet Russia, it has only heard the public and newspapers express deep sympathy for China. Since the Northeast Incident, it has repeatedly published statements criticizing Japanese imperialism. It is already possible to know its consistent attitude. Japan thinks that it has no magic way to resolve its conflict of interest with the United States, but it is still trying its best to win over Soviet Russia and is unwilling to give up this glimmer of hope. Therefore, it often calls out, saying that Germany was once trapped in a siege of French-affiliated countries and fell into an isolated position. Later, it concluded the Treaty of Rapallo with Soviet Russia, which greatly surprised Britain and France. As a result, it was able to restrain their (Britain and France) actions, which is well known to the world. This is a historical fact that can be followed. Indeed, Soviet Russia, which occupies one-sixth of the world's area and has a population of 140 million, is of course a powerful determining factor in the international political situation and has attracted worldwide attention due to its different founding ideology. The Japanese say that if such a powerful factor in the international political situation can be taken for myself (referring to Japan) or have its power taken by others but actually controlled by me (Japan), then our country (Japan) must deeply consider this and then take decisive measures to obtain it.</p>
<p>Four. Connecting with Soviet Russia to restrain Britain. The Japanese also say that Britain is deeply afraid of Soviet Russia's power invading from the Middle East and Central Asia's rear because of its relationship with India and other countries. This is Britain's traditional fear and it is always vigilant. Furthermore, considering India, Britain's treasury, it is also afraid that the Russians will stir up trouble from within and make it impossible for it to suppress the recent trend of national awakening. This is where Soviet Russia can freely restrain the activities of the British in the Far East political situation.</p>
<p>Five. Connecting with Soviet Russia to restrain the United States. The Japanese say that Soviet Russia was already a powerful factor in Far Eastern diplomacy during the imperial era. It also joined Japan in resisting the eastward expansion of American power more than once. The failure of the Knox Manchurian Railway Neutralization Plan is a good example. Now, Soviet Russia's attitude is still the same as in the past, with no change. Therefore, if Japan and Russia can join hands again, even if there is a strong America in East Asian diplomacy, it would not dare to look down on Japan again. Recently, the conclusion of the oil trading contract, in addition to its economic significance, is equivalent to sending an arrow to the United States in terms of international relations. This alone is enough to greatly weaken the pressure on Japan from the United States. From the opposite perspective, it can greatly increase Japan's resistance to the United States.</p>
<p>Six. United with Russia to control China. The Japanese say that China's traditional foreign policy has always been summed up in one sentence: "Using barbarians to control barbarians." Thus, in the recent Northeast Incident, the Chinese government also hoped to use American power to control Japan, or begged for aid from Britain to resist Japan, or went a step further and wanted to combine the pressure of Britain and the United States on Japan. Now, it has suddenly changed direction and resumed diplomatic relations with Soviet Russia. However, if Japan can promote the conclusion of a Japanese-Soviet non-aggression treaty, making Japanese-Russian relations closer, then this kind of trick of China's will be unusable, and the dream of uniting Russia to control Japan will become a bubble. Furthermore, Japan can even unite with Soviet Russia to put pressure on China.</p>
<p>Seven. Economic benefits gained after uniting with Russia. Supporters also say that if Japanese-Russian trade can be restored as soon as possible, both countries can mutually benefit from the increase in economic benefits. At present, what Soviet Russia hopes for is nothing more than credit financing. In recent years, Soviet Russia has been dumping agricultural products around the world as much as possible, and its goal is to seek funds. Now, if a certain country can give her credit financing and sell her machinery and other industrial products on credit, then what more would Soviet Russia ask for? Of course, giving credit to Russia naturally involves some risks, which we (the Japanese call themselves) must carefully plan in advance. If there is no better way for the time being, it is better to temporarily exchange goods as the most stable form of transaction. We sell her industrial goods on credit and exchange them for her agricultural products and other things, such as last year's oil trading contract. If we can go a step further, we may as well apply this form of transaction universally to all trade. In this regard, the conclusion of a Japanese-Soviet non-aggression treaty can be an aid to its promotion.</p>
<p>Eight. After uniting with Russia, the defense line can be shortened in the event of a war with the United States. Those who advocate the conclusion say that if a war were to break out between Japan and the United States, Japan would have less to worry about from Russia because it had already signed a non-aggression treaty with Russia, and the defense line could also be greatly shortened. Conversely, if Japan and Russia have not concluded a non-aggression treaty, or if it is assumed that there are still some suspicions between the two countries, then Japan's defense line must not only be extended to the entire coastline of its own territory, but also send troops to China (because a Japanese-American war would simultaneously be a Japanese-Chinese-American war). In addition, it has to be wary of Soviet Russia.</p>
<p>The above has thoroughly and exhaustively described the various benefits that the Japanese side would gain after the conclusion of a Japanese-Soviet non-aggression treaty, as cited by those who advocate its conclusion. However, looking back at the current domestic state of Japan, it is still in a time of turmoil, and the diplomatic situation is even more critical. Therefore, no matter how magnificent the rhetoric of Japanese diplomats may be, it cannot compensate for the isolation of its diplomatic position. Therefore, today's international situation is like a mirage on top of a polar iceberg. As long as our government can make up its mind and deal with the Japanese warlords with strength, the international situation will definitely change. As the saying goes, "Heaven helps those who help themselves." I hope that our government can encourage itself. (End)</p>

<p>The Control Yuan recently dispatched Supervising Committee members Zhou Lisheng and Gao Lu to Peiping (Beijing) to investigate the artifacts of the Palace Museum. The two committee members, Zhou and Gao, have completed their investigation and issued a report.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Now, the director of the Palace Museum, Yi Peiji, has also replied to the document from Supervising Committee members Zhou and Gao. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Concerning the report on the investigation of the Palace Museum by Supervising Committee members Zhou Lisheng and Gao Lu, I will use this [reply] to clarify right and wrong. The affairs of this museum, from the time when Puyi was expelled from the palace in the thirteenth year [of the Republic, 1924] until now, nine years later, have been filled with numerous incidents and fraught with danger. The responsibilities of my position are heavy, as everyone knows, and there is no need to elaborate. This time, the two Supervising Committee members, Zhou Lisheng and Gao Lu, were dispatched to Peiping to investigate a case that was essentially unfounded and fabricated. Considering the nation's difficulties and the lack of clarity regarding right and wrong, I and my colleagues at the museum have borne the burden silently, providing every possible convenience for the investigation. Therefore, although they only spent two weeks in Peiping, we showed them everything about the museum without reservation. Now, having read the investigation report submitted by Committee members Zhou and Gao, I see that they have stated things in great detail. While there are some criticisms, there are also many praises. This shows that there are no personal abuses of power, and what others have said is unfounded. However, the report also points out several things in the second and third sections, all of which are based on a lack of understanding of the situation and are attempts to accommodate others. It even touches on Yi Peiji's personal freedom, creating contradictions that are cause for concern. From Yi Peiji's personal point of view, I feel no guilt and could ignore this entirely. However, the Palace Museum holds a position of importance both in China and abroad. In recent years, international figures have donated funds for construction and provided assistance, placing even greater importance on it than the Chinese people themselves. If I do not defend the museum, I fear it will harm the government's reputation for employing talent wisely, damage both domestic and international trust, and have a significant impact on the museum's future. Therefore, I make the following key points:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the criticism in the second section of the original report concerning the valuation and prior purchase of items by staff, the disposal of items has always started with bidding, followed by public sale and retail sale. The first part of this section of the report explains this in great detail. The value for public and retail sales was based on the bidding value, with some items being increased significantly. Mr. Li is an advisor to the museum and is skilled in pricing furs, so he was entrusted with estimating the value. As the bidding or commercial estimates were used as the basis, with only increases allowed and no reductions permitted, there was no possibility of corruption. Furthermore, Mr. Li, to avoid suspicion, never purchased a single piece of fur himself, which is a well-known fact. The pricing of other items was determined by various supervisory committee members after extensive consideration. Mr. Li did not intervene. As for the museum staff, sales were initially scheduled for Saturdays, entirely because there were too many external patrons on Sundays, and we did not want museum staff to be mixed in. After holding sales for four Saturdays, we cancelled them immediately due to concerns about possible misunderstandings. Committee member Zhou mistakenly stated that it was for a month, when it was actually four Saturdays, concluding that there was fraud without any actual evidence (the so-called "statements from museum police or staff" did not provide any concrete evidence of fraud, nor did they identify the speaker), which is akin to accommodating others.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the accusation that the disposal of gold items was not decided by the board of directors, that the rules issued by the Executive Yuan did not mention gold items, and that the supplementary filing for record was rejected, although only four items were listed when the board of directors met, the colleagues present in Beijing at the time could not remember all the items to be disposed of. The word "etc." was added after the names of the four items, such as furs, and the phrase "unrelated to historical culture," clearly indicating the intent. Otherwise, listing the four items would have been sufficient, without needing to add the subsequent text. Anyone familiar with logic can understand this. The proceeds from the disposal of items were reported each time a sum was obtained. The gold items were disposed of on August 12th last year, and a report was immediately submitted, receiving directive No. 240, which should have approved the filing. The dates and numbers of the three filings were separately supplemented and declared. This was done in accordance with the instructions, and on September 9th, we received instructions to file the attachments for record. This was a matter that had already been approved. There was no so-called supplementary filing, nor was there any so-called rejection. Furthermore, the original order had already been copied and given to the committee member. How could there be such an error? This matter has already been filed with the Executive Yuan, so the so-called supervisory committee member has no authority in this matter, and the claims of Prosecutor Liu that there was no formal discussion are no longer relevant. Moreover, Article 1 of the Supervisory Committee's rules includes the term "disposal," and meetings have minutes and signatures as proof. How can it be said that the supervisory committee member for the disposal of items has no authority over the disposal of items, and what does it mean to say that there was no formal discussion? This is truly incomprehensible.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the claim in the same section that the gold Eight Immortals dishes and bowls had artistic and historical value, the gold Eight Immortals dishes and bowls were all damaged and poorly made, with absolutely no artistic value. They do not have any dates and are mostly recent items. Furthermore, the museum currently has many complete items that are slightly older. These types of items can be found in any ordinary gold shop. The supervising committee member did not see these items and, based solely on their own imagination, insisted that they must have historical and cultural value, which is arbitrary.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the claim in the same section about value and purity, the supervising committee member's statements are purely based on imagination. The usual practice for selling ordinary gold items is to treat them as "crude gold," and their value is inevitably lower than the purchase price. The value of the gold items disposed of by the museum was based on the daily published price of gold, which was more favorable than usual. As for the purity, the original items were clearly marked with a certain purity, which can be verified by the records. The supervising committee members, government officials, and merchants at the time all saw this. The copper and lead content that was removed further proves the error of assuming that the purity of tribute items must be high (and these items were all handled by the Qing Imperial Household Department, with records available, so calling them tribute items is also incorrect). The bidding purity reached as high as 942, as shown by the current bid sheets. The supervising committee member's claim that it was around 60% is also not credible.</p>
<p>(5) Regarding the claim based on the statement of former accounting section staff member Qin Hanyuan about privately creating accounts, compiling final accounts is a normal part of accounting and is beyond reproach. If there was any falsification or inflation of figures, the supervising committee member should have provided evidence. How can they smear [me] with vague terms like "inappropriate use of personnel"? Furthermore, these final accounts have been verified by the Audit Department and show no discrepancies. The section chief referred to by the supervising committee member as Xiao is actually a staff member named Su. At that time, the National Government appointed various section chiefs, but many could not take office due to lack of salary. Therefore, the staff members could only handle some sporadic section affairs. Also, because there were too many outstanding debts, it was impossible to close the accounts, leading to delays. The fact is very simple, and there is no "inappropriate use of personnel."</p>
<p>(6) Regarding the claim that the director has a fondness for antiques and does not avoid suspicion, the supervising committee member himself knows that personal hobbies should not be interfered with, so including it in the report and considering it "improper handling" is already strange. Furthermore, citing Chairman Yu personally seeing Yi Peiji buying and selling antiques in a certain prince's mansion, with a large amount of money involved, is even more unfounded. I have never set foot in an auction house in Peiping. Furthermore, a customer at an auction house would never sell the item immediately. This is something anyone with common sense would know. The report referring to both buying and selling is absurd. What prince's mansion is being referred to? What was purchased? Who is the witness? Is there any purchase order or receipt as evidence? All of this should be clearly indicated with accurate information. As for the losses to my family's business in Jiangwan, whether there is anything left at home, the supervising committee member has no prior relationship with me, so how could they investigate this? The claim is based on hearsay, but what is the basis? Yi Peiji acts with an open heart, so what suspicion or doubt is there? Therefore, the difficulties of the Palace Museum's operations and the lack of funding are well known. The budget is lower than that of any other central government agency, and the Ministry of Finance owes over 700,000 [yuan]. Yi Peiji and his colleagues strive to be the first to complete their tasks and preserve and promote the nation's culture with minimal compensation. The original report also praised the beautiful continuation of the museum's work. Yi Peiji and others dare not boast, but the effort and energy expended have been considerable. Even regarding the disposal of items, although it is about turning the useless into the useful, my colleagues and I are concerned that it may lead to slander. The reason we have persevered despite the difficulties is for the sake of this unique cultural institution. Therefore, during each supervisory committee meeting, the disposal methods and the price standards for bidding, public sale, and retail sale were carefully discussed. To prevent excessively low prices, bidding was the primary method. If the bid price was not up to standard, the price would be increased and changed to a public sale, both to show transparency and to prevent merchants from monopolizing the market. For the gold items, due to the large quantity and fluctuating prices, public sale to individuals could easily lead to corruption, so they were sold entirely by bidding. Furthermore, there were repeated announcements that bids with purity below standard were invalid, showing the utmost care. The proceeds were all deposited into a fund. The supervising committee member investigated this very clearly. Now, all the prevention expenses in the Yuanmingyuan [Old Summer Palace] rely on this fund. In the past, it was considered a virtue not to avoid suspicion and resentment, but who knew that it would now be considered a crime? How regrettable! Yi Peiji is strict with himself and lenient with others. If he could have more candid friends, he would be fortunate. However, this matter is of great importance and comes at this time, which could open the eyes and ears of both Chinese and foreigners, unlike ordinary personal affairs. Therefore, I provide this defense. Yi Peiji, Director of the Palace Museum.</p>
<h3>### Yan Xishan Issues Strict Order to Eliminate Drugs, Commanding All Military Officers to Quit by Deadline</h3>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence. Drugs in Shanxi Province, such as Golden Pills and opium powder, have been actively investigated and prohibited since the establishment of the Drug Prohibition Committee by the provincial government. Although they have gradually decreased among the public, the committee has no authority over the military. Yan Xishan recently received reports that many military officers in various units are addicted to these substances. Yesterday, he convened a high-level military officer meeting at the Suiyuan Garrison Headquarters to formulate a plan to eliminate drugs by a deadline. The Military Reorganization Committee issued instructions to all units to comply immediately. The original order is as follows: "Firstly, drugs such as opium and heroin greatly hinder the progress of the military and are a major enemy of the military. This committee is responsible for promoting the progress of the troops and has repeatedly ordered all units to prohibit them by a deadline. According to recent reports, over fifty officers and non-commissioned officers in various units are suspected of being addicted to these substances. After sending personnel to verify, the reports were confirmed. It has been decided to announce their names and order their superiors to urge them to quit voluntarily as soon as possible. The committee will conduct inspections again in four weeks. All of this is to ensure the survival of the troops and to urge individuals to wake up. The responsibilities involved are not based on emotions. I hope all my comrades understand this. Among the more than fifty people listed in the table, a few are only suspected, but after the inspection, the truth will come out, and it will be announced clearly so that no one is wronged. Even if they are indeed addicted, those who can quit completely within four weeks should also be publicly commended to the entire army as an encouragement to those who are brave enough to pull themselves out of the mire. There are approximately five thousand officers and non-commissioned officers in our army, and this time only over fifty people are named in the table. Besides these, there may be others who are addicted but have not been discovered. In addition to continuing to send personnel to investigate secretly, I hope everyone is vigilant and eradicates the addiction thoroughly. Do not think that you can drink poison to quench your thirst just because you have not been exposed. In short, this committee's announcement of this list of suspected individuals is purely out of sincerity and concern. I hope that those who are guilty will correct themselves, and those who are not will work harder. The inspection methods in the future will be based on fairness. Those who are guilty cannot hide, and those who are not cannot be wronged, so as to achieve the goal of complete abstinence and a healthy military. May all officers and non-commissioned officers understand this." (February 1st)</p>
<h3>Misunderstanding Between the "Beidou" and "Jingdong" Ships in Chaozhou and Shantou</h3>
<p>One Belongs to the Customs, One Belongs to the Pacification Headquarters</p>
<p>They Exchanged Fire on the Sea, But the Reason is Unclear</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence. The Chaozhou Customs has two patrol ships, one called "Beidou" and the other called "Chaoan." Both are newly equipped with high-speed engines, capable of traveling 18 miles per hour. They are equipped with three cannon and two new-style machine guns, as well as over ten rifles. The captains are Westerners, and the crew members have all received new-style naval training. The accuracy of their guns is very high. These two ships are directly under the jurisdiction of the Inspector General of Customs and the Ministry of Finance. Since the new tariff regulations were promulgated, there has been an increase in smuggled goods in the Chaozhou and Shantou area. Therefore, these two ships were assigned to Shantou to be under the command and dispatch of the Customs Commissioner of Chaozhou for anti-smuggling operations. As for the division of labor, the "Beidou" ship usually patrols the outer sea, while the "Chaoan" ship inspects incoming ships near Mayu Island daily. It is said that they have seized many smuggled goods as a result, which has caused the smugglers to hate them. The "Jingdong" ship is a small, pointed-head electric boat converted for military use, capable of traveling seven or eight miles per hour. The ship can carry one hundred and twenty people to sea. The ship belongs to the Eastern District Pacification Headquarters and is used to apprehend pirates and transport soldiers. The ship flies a military flag on its stern. The counties in the Eastern District are divided into nine joint defense zones. Tan Langxing is the director of the joint defense of Raoping, Chenghai, and Nan'ao counties. Tan is also the deputy commander of the Seventh Division of the Third Army and the commander of the Twentieth Regiment. His troops are stationed in Shantou and the coastal towns of the three counties of Raoping, Chenghai, and Nan'ao. A company of his troops, led by Liang Shaoan, is stationed in Nan'ao County. On January 17th, at 2:20 PM, the "Jingdong" ship was sailing from Zhelin towards Nan'ao when it encountered the "Beidou" ship. The "Jingdong" ship suddenly accelerated and sailed back within its defense line. The "Beidou" ship actually chased after it and opened fire. The "Jingdong" ship returned fire while retreating. It was dusk at the time, and the "Beidou" ship continued to chase and fire its cannons. When the "Jingdong" approached the coast of Nan'ao, its bow was hit by a cannonball and it sank into the sea. The residents of Nan'ao were panicked, suspecting that a foreign warship was invading. They fled with their elderly and children. After the fighting stopped, military and government officials came out to issue announcements to inform the citizens that it was a misunderstanding. On the morning of the 18th, the "Beidou" ship was still near the coast of Nan'ao. Liang Shaoan, the company commander of the Nan'ao garrison, immediately telegraphed the regiment headquarters in Shantou, reporting that at 5:00 AM that day, the Customs' "Beidou" ship opened fire on our defense area with cannons and machine guns, causing the people of the entire city to scatter and flee. Our "Jingdong" ship has been destroyed, and the number of deaths, injuries, and lost weapons is being investigated and will be reported later. Please negotiate with the Chaozhou Customs. According to the report, the regiment headquarters of the Twentieth Regiment immediately dispatched Yang Huanming, the director of the political department, to lodge a protest with the Customs Superintendent, requesting that the Customs Commissioner be instructed to detain the captain of the "Beidou" ship for investigation. Customs Superintendent Xiao Songqin immediately sent a letter to the Customs Commissioner to inquire. The Customs Commissioner said that if the "Beidou" ship had provoked the incident without cause, it would be illegal. He would telegraph the ship to return to Shantou, investigate the matter clearly, and then reply in writing. On the 20th, he telegraphed the "Beidou" to come to Shantou. On the morning of the 21st, the "Beidou" had arrived in Shantou. The truth of the matter should not be difficult to ascertain. According to the Twentieth Regiment, this case must be thoroughly investigated, and it has been reported to the Eastern District Pacification Headquarters and Deputy Commander Tan for instructions.</p>
<h3>Robbery by the Wu Clan in Jiangsong Mapeng</h3>
<p>In recent times, there have been cases of robbery and kidnapping in various districts of Punan. Even poor farmers with only a few pecks of rice and tattered clothes have been targeted by bandits. The Wu Jingfang family in the Wutu area of Mapeng Town was robbed the other night, around twelve o'clock at night. More than ten bandits, carrying a pistol, broke into the house and forced the victim to reveal the location of the hidden silver. They robbed the family of more than seventy yuan in cash and each piece of their father and son leather clothing. Before leaving, they also wanted to kidnap the victim's young granddaughter. In a moment of desperation, the victim stepped forward to protect her, causing an injury to his forehead by the bandits.</p>
<h3>Three People Escape Kidnapping</h3>
<p>Xu Kexin in Dongcun, Punan, has some assets and a fondness for martial arts. He had hired a martial arts instructor to train at home. Unexpectedly, on the night of December 22nd last year, more than ten bandits broke into the house. The martial arts instructor heard the noise and came out to resist, but he was outnumbered. The bandits entered the house and kidnapped Xu Kexin, his nephew, and a friend of the martial arts instructor, placing them on a waiting steamboat and escaping. After the incident, the victim received a letter from the bandits demanding a ransom of 40,000 yuan. The Xu family sent people with 4,000 yuan to negotiate according to the address and conditions in the letter, but without result. Until the other night, the guards watching the hostages fell asleep after drinking. The hostages seized the opportunity to escape through the window. They learned that the place was Caoging Town. After receiving travel expenses from people, they bought tickets and safely escaped by long-distance bus. However, the two people who were sent to negotiate the second time have not yet returned home. It is unknown what has happened to them.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Reporters' Association Requests Punishment for Gu Zhutong</h3>
<p>The Wuxi News Reporters' Association held its spring membership meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM to discuss the association's affairs. The important proposals included submitting a request to the central government for severe punishment of Gu Zhutong, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and for the strict arrest of the murderer who shot Wang Weisan, as well as those who masterminded the murder.</p>
<h3>Grain Industry Uses New Measures</h3>
<p>The county government of Wuxi believes that the standardization of measuring instruments in the county should be done as soon as possible and should not be delayed any further to avoid hindering important government affairs. It is specially stipulated that the rice, bean, and grain industries must complete the construction of new measures within February and send them to the county government for inspection. Starting from March 1st, all stores must use the new instruments. Starting from today, inspections will be carried out. In addition to ordering the Public Security Bureau to send police to assist in the inspection, the rice, bean, and grain trade associations were also ordered yesterday to instruct all merchants to comply and not delay on any pretext.</p>
<h3>Sudden Subsidence of the Stone Footing of the Great Bridge</h3>
<p>Since the commencement of dredging the Great Bridge River outside the North Gate of Wuxi, work has been intensified in recent days. The river has been dredged to a depth of more than eight feet. The excavated river mud has been used to fill the Great River Pond and build a new market. The retaining walls on both sides have also been repaired by the merchants themselves. The bridge blocks of the Great Bridge are also under construction and repair. The dredging costs are estimated at more than 5,000 yuan. The repair costs of the Great Bridge are not included in the budget. However, the Great Bridge is an important passage in the north of the city, and it has been in disrepair for many years and is in serious condition. There is a danger of it collapsing. The Engineering Committee for Dredging the Great Bridge River, due to funding difficulties, planned to make minor repairs to the bridge. Unexpectedly, after the repair, the stone footing of the bridge blocks suddenly subsided by about two inches, which is extremely dangerous. The work was temporarily stopped immediately. Yesterday, the committee convened an emergency meeting to discuss funding methods and purchased dozens of barrels of waterproof cement for repairing the bridge blocks and the connecting retaining walls. The work is currently underway and should be completed within a few days.</p>
<h3>A Large Number of Bandits Rob Rural Homes in Changzhou</h3>
<p>The Wu Guimin family in Huayi Zou Wujia Village in the second district of Wujin County was robbed by a large number of bandits, over sixty in number, the other night. After breaking down the door, they beat and injured Wu Guisheng, the victim, and his elderly father. All their clothing, belongings, and more than ten loads of white rice were robbed. Upon inspection after the incident, the losses were about 500 yuan. Wu Guisheng came to the city on the 4th to report the case to the county government for investigation.</p>
<h3>Public Security Bureau Uncovers Gambling Den</h3>
<p>The Wujin County Public Security Bureau visited the second floor of the Huang Bao Car Company in the weaving machine workshop on the night of the 3rd and heard reports of gambling. Inspector Xu Shengteng was sent to lead a team of police to investigate. They found the doors locked and gambling taking place on the third floor. The police immediately climbed up a ladder and arrested the owners, Xiao Wei You, gamblers Qian Gu Bao, and thirty others, along with gambling paraphernalia and dominoes. On the 4th, Director Wu Shengfang of the Supervisory Office conducted a preliminary hearing. As a result, they were each sentenced to twelve days of detention as a warning.</p>
<h3>Bandits Rob Silver Shop in Oouqu Town, Changshu</h3>
<p>Oouqu Town, located about three li east of the east gate of the county, is a small market town with about several hundred households and shops. Last night (3rd) at 2:00 AM, five bandits, wearing coats and speaking a Hakka dialect, robbed the Xinhe Silver Shop in the town for about an hour before leaving. They resulted in the loss of over six hundred yuan in silver and dozens of pieces of ornaments. Fortunately, there were more silver utensils. The total loss was about seven or eight hundred yuan. The victim has reported the incident for investigation.</p>
<h3>Division of Authority Between the District Commander and the District Head of the Zhenjiang Defense Corps</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Defense Committee has modified the provisional measures for the division of authority between the district commander and the district head of the defense corps in accordance with the modifications made by the Ministry of Interior. It has sent a letter to the Jiangsu Provincial Government to consult the Ministry of Interior for the record. The relevant measures are listed as follows: (1) Before the district, township, and village chiefs are elected, the division of authority between the commander-in-chief and the district head shall be handled in accordance with these measures, in accordance with Article 5, Paragraph 1 of the revised Jiangsu Provincial County Defense Corps Implementation Rules.

The district heads shall be responsible for assisting. (3) All matters related to checking household registration shall be handled by the district heads in conjunction with the township and village chiefs. (4) Matters relating to joint security agreements shall be handled by the district corps patrol chief, but district heads and unelected township and village chiefs who do not serve as patrol chiefs shall be responsible for handling them. (5) Township chiefs concurrently serving as patrol chiefs or deputies shall be subject to the command and supervision of the district commander regarding the defense corps matters. (6) Matters related to the collection of defense expenses shall be subject to the defense expense management office of the respective counties as the competent authority. Without the authorization of the director of the management office, neither the district head nor the district commander may collect them without authorization. Violators will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Construction of Rivers still needs to continue</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department has issued a notice to all counties to comply with the levy of labor for dredging rivers. Most counties have submitted replies and have complied. However, the Provincial Department is currently improving the system, and the county construction bureaus and offices have been ordered to merge with the county government. The Construction Department is deeply concerned that the levy of labor for dredging rivers in various counties will be suspended as a result. Therefore, it has issued a notice to all county magistrates to continue to take active responsibility for this matter.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou Police Team Intercepts a Kidnapped Child</h3>
<p>Ten bandits were living in Dangzhuzhuang in the ninth district of the county. After villagers reported the incident, the police team was sent to arrest them. There was a fierce battle with the bandits for half an hour. The bandits were outnumbered and fled northeast. The police team tracked them down and intercepted a seven-year-old kidnapped boy. He has been taken to the city and turned over to the county government for public display.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing Jiaping Highway is Being Planned</h3>
<p>The highway from Jiaxing to Wangjiang泾 is about to be completed and will be open to traffic in April or May. It is learned that the highway from Jiaxing to Pinghu will also begin construction. The route runs from Jiaxing through Dongzha to Xinfeng and then to Pinghu. The road is fourteen kilometers long, and the construction cost is estimated at more than 50,000 yuan. The cost will be borne equally by the two counties of Pinghu and Jiaxing. Liang Hua, the director of the Jiaxing County Construction Section, has agreed with the Pinghu construction authorities. The construction cost of more than 25,000 yuan for Jiaxing has been decided to be allocated from the 20,000 yuan from the sale of the public land opposite the old fort in Beicheng. The remaining amount will be paid from the special local construction fund.</p>
<h3>Notice from the Guangzhou City Exhibition Preparatory Committee</h3>
<p>This committee was established on November 1, 1932, and is working in the municipal government. It is scheduled to open an exhibition on February 15 of this year. If you have any products to be sent to the exhibition, please send them before January 31. The address for receiving items is in Guangzhou: Zhonghua Book Company, Sincere Company, Daxin Company, and No. 13 Guangwei Road.</p>
<h3>Pinghu Water Police Arrest Gamblers, Villagers Panic</h3>
<p>Maritime police patrol officer Zhang Chang, etc., were ordered to investigate a case. They passed through Baojia埭, which is under the jurisdiction of 泾乍浦, and happened to see people gambling in a teahouse. They went inside to arrest the gamblers and caught a boy, Bao A'er, and more than forty copper coins on the table. The villagers said that the matter was minor and persuaded them to release him. Zhang et al. refused, which led to a conflict. Zhang Chang was beaten by more than ten farmers and fled in disgrace. The other night, dozens of armed water police went to Baojia埭 to arrest people. At midnight, they broke into the home of the village chief, Mr. Hu, and demanded that he lead them to arrest them. He escaped through the back door. Mr. Hu's wife was greatly embarrassed. Yesterday, the local people were in great panic and fled to Zha城 to avoid the situation. By 4:00 PM, they had not returned. There were more than 200 people. It is heard that the Public Security Bureau is trying to persuade them to avoid escalating the situation.</p>
<h3>Review of Profits and Losses of Various Industries in Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Most industries in Xiaoshan officially opened on the 5th after the New Year break. However, last year's business was slightly better than the previous year. The most profitable industries were North-South Goods and Tea Food, followed by Foreign Goods and Aquatic Operations. The worst industries were the Money Industry and the Brick-Gray Industry, and the Rice Industry had the largest losses. It is heard that old rice shops such as Guanghe裕 Kang outside the East Gate lost as much as seven or eight thousand yuan. The New Year is not expected to recover the losses.</p>
<h3>Spreading of Diphtheria in the Suburbs</h3>
<p>Recently, a type of diphtheria has been discovered in the area outside the South Gate of Shandong. It spreads rapidly, and deaths are frequently heard of. In the past three days, more than thirty young children in the surrounding villages have died from this disease.</p>
<h3>Letter from Zhenjiang Ji Ying Feng</h3>
<p>Regarding, upon reading your newspaper's Zhenjiang news column on February 4th, it stated that the oldest Ji Ying Feng firm, known for Jiang Guangye's brand, has always had a surplus in previous years, but also suffered losses last year. It also mentioned that during a recent discussion, a shareholder surnamed Wang strongly advocated for closure and first laid off eight employees, etc., which is very surprising. At a recent shareholders' meeting of our firm, it was unanimously decided that this year's operations would proceed with a tight budget, and no shareholder advocated for closure. As this matter affects the future of our firm's business, we respectfully request that your newspaper correct this in the letter column. Respectfully addressed to the chief editor of the Shen Bao newspaper, Ji Ying Feng Qian Ji from Zhenjiang, February 4th.</p>

<h3>Chen Youren and His Wife Arrived in Shanghai Last Night</h3>
<p>Immediately Attended a Dinner Hosted by Sun Ke and His Wife</p>
<p>Chen Stated That He Had No Important Task in Returning to Shanghai</p>
<p>Whether or Not to Enter Beijing Is Still Undecided</p>
<p>Former Foreign Minister Chen Youren, accompanied by his wife, Ms. Zhang Liying, traveled to Europe last June. They returned to Shanghai last night at 8:30 PM aboard the Italian mail ship Ganqi. After disembarking, Mr. and Mrs. Chen immediately went to the Sun residence on Columbia Road to attend a dinner hosted by Mr. and Mrs. Sun Zhesheng. Details are provided below:</p>
<h3>Welcoming at the Wharf</h3>
<p>The Italian mail ship Ganqi arrived at the Wusongkou yesterday at 7:00 PM, but only docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou at 8:00 PM. Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke, representing Li Zhaohuan, former Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Li Shengwu, and more than ten of Mr. Chen's relatives, friends, and Sun family members were present to welcome him at the wharf. After the ship docked, the welcoming party boarded the ship and shook hands with Mr. and Mrs. Chen. Mr. Chen wore a yellow woolen coat and looked as elegant as ever. His wife wore a Western-style suit and a green woolen coat. At 8:30 PM, they disembarked together. Mr. and Mrs. Chen rode in car number 1829, prepared by the Sun residence, and drove to the Sun Zhesheng residence on Columbia Road to attend a dinner party. After a seven-month farewell, they had a pleasant conversation. They dispersed at around 10:00 PM, and Mr. and Mrs. Chen returned to their residence on West Aisi Road to rest.</p>
<h3>Chen's Remarks</h3>
<p>Mr. Chen had a short conversation with reporters from various newspapers on the ship. Mr. Chen said that he had traveled in Europe for several months, spending most of his time in France and occasionally visiting Italy. He did not go to Geneva or Germany, so he did not meet with Mr. Wang Jingwei. He left Europe on January 11th and returned to China by ship. This trip is just like a regular traveler returning from a long journey, and there are no other important tasks. When asked if he was summoned back to China by Mr. Sun Zhesheng or someone from the government to discuss a plan to save the country from its troubles, Mr. Chen replied that Mr. Sun and others did not send any telegrams and that it was all speculation. When asked if he planned to go to Beijing, he replied that he had not yet decided. Finally, when asked about the Northeast issue and Mr. Chen's personal views on the League of Nations, Mr. Chen said that the issue was too complex to be answered in a few simple words. He asked the reporters to visit him another day, when he would explain in detail, or he could publish his opinions himself.</p>
<h3>Tang Youren's Remarks</h3>
<p>President Wang Will Leave Europe and Return to China</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Mr. Tang Youren, Secretary-General of the Central Political Council, came to Shanghai to visit his ailing mother. Reporters interviewed Mr. Tang yesterday and asked about President Wang's condition and the date of his return to China. He graciously granted an audience, and the conversation was very informative. The details are described below:</p>
<h3>Wang Will Return to China</h3>
<p>Mr. Tang said that in addition to diabetes, President Wang also had liver pain, similar to what President Sun suffered. Fortunately, it was discovered early, so after careful treatment, the microbes in the liver have been eliminated. However, the damaged part of the liver is difficult to restore. Mr. Wang is currently resting in the Carlsbad (Karlovy Vary) hot springs in the Czech Republic. The climate there is mild and suitable for his health. However, due to the urgent national crisis, Mr. Wang is reluctant to stay abroad for long. Therefore, he will take a ship back east in a week.</p>
<h3>National Assembly</h3>
<p>The reporter then asked how far the drafting of the organizational regulations for the National Assembly had progressed, as well as the powers and elections of the National Assembly. Mr. Tang replied that the drafting of these organizational regulations has been held for many meetings, but there is still no concrete decision. When the Central Political Council submitted the proposal, it did not add any scope or principles. However, the right to make the final decision for the National Assembly should still belong to the central government. The scope of the council's powers is difficult to define, because it cannot lose the meaning of expressing public opinion, and it cannot conflict with party principles. As for the method of producing members, it is also a difficult problem. However, in the future, it should be based on the results of local autonomy implementation before an appropriate method can be selected.</p>
<h3>Drafting of the Constitution</h3>
<p>Regarding the drafting of the constitution, Mr. Tang also expressed his opinion, saying that a flexible constitution seems more appropriate for China, because a rigid one requires complete provisions, but its implementation is inevitably hindered. The draft constitution will be drafted by the Legislative Yuan, submitted to the Central Political Council for approval, and then passed and implemented by the National Assembly.</p>
<h3>Aviation Plan</h3>
<p>The reporter also asked Mr. Tang for his opinion on the aviation rescue movement. Mr. Tang said that he certainly agrees with saving the country through aviation, but there must be an overall plan that takes everything into consideration in order to achieve practical results. Japan's invasion of us, and the power of its aircraft, is of course frightening, and arouses the enthusiasm for emulation, but Japan's victory is not solely dependent on the strength of its air force. Therefore, our country must also make overall plans to strengthen its naval and land forces. Someone suggested that each county in China should purchase one aircraft, which would result in thousands of aircraft, and then our air force would be considerable. Regardless of China's overall economic situation, whether each county can raise one or two hundred thousand yuan to purchase aircraft, the waste of thousands of aircraft purchase costs alone could bankrupt our country completely, and we would perish without a war. Moreover, simply purchasing aircraft without considering fuel and the training of pilots would render the many aircraft useless. Furthermore, the Chinese people rely on momentary enthusiasm for everything. It must be understood that science is prosperous and changes daily. Without an overall and permanent plan, all aircraft will lose their power in two or three years. At that time, our large number of aircraft will become useless. It is now heard that an aircraft factory is being planned, and I very much agree with this. I also hope that the people of the country will pay the same attention to other necessary equipment and personnel training.</p>
<h3>Wang Delin Did Not Enter Russia and Is Still Supervising the War in the Dongning Area</h3>
<p>The Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe Volunteer Army Support Association received a letter yesterday from Liang Yuanshan and Sun Chuyu, representatives of the Jilin National Salvation Army Commander-in-Chief Wang Delin, stationed in Shanghai. They said that Wang Delin himself is currently supervising the war in the Dongning area, and his troops are still resisting the enemy in Hunchun, Wangqing, and other places. The following is a copy of the letter: Respectfully, today we received a letter from He Zixing, a staff officer in Beiping, which included a letter from the Dongning headquarters dated the 18th of last month. It contained many hidden meanings, which we have translated as follows: (omitted above) The order here is very uneasy, but the defense is tight, so there is nothing else to worry about. We have forwarded everything you asked us to. Commander-in-Chief Wang is still supervising the team in Dongning, holding the dangerous area by the □□ place. Right-wing commander Wang Yuzhen has been fighting fiercely with the enemy in Hunchun, Wangqing, and other counties for days. Although our army is under the shells dropped by enemy aircraft, it is not afraid at all, and it has charged several times, killing hundreds of enemies. Our army has only suffered more than twenty casualties. The original defense area has not been abandoned one step. What is suffering is the lack of ammunition, which is difficult to maintain. How can the body of flesh and blood last? Looking forward to the future, we are extremely anxious. We urgently hope to receive assistance as soon as possible to save the lives of tens of thousands of soldiers waiting to die. Commander-in-Chief Wang and Commander Wang Yuzhen and other generals are hoping that Staff Officer He Zixing will return to the front defense as soon as possible to plan together, so as to encourage morale, and also hope that Representative Liang can negotiate with all parties to appeal for assistance in funds and ammunition, etc., and quickly bring them to the front to meet the urgent needs, which is very important (omitted below). According to this situation, there was a previous telegram from Commander-in-Chief Wang, and there was a report from Ms. Liu on the 12th of this month when she entered the customs from Xiaosuifen. Now there is a reply from the 18th, so it can be seen that the rumors published in various newspapers last month that Commander-in-Chief Wang led a team of more than 600 people to retreat into Russia were all false. The current situation at the front is very fierce, and the moment of life and death is imminent. If we allow the Eastern Jilin Volunteer Army to sit idly by and not save them, they will inevitably be wiped out by the enemy, and then the enemy can have no worries and attack Rehe with all their strength. Therefore, if we want to retain the Eastern Jilin Volunteer Army to contain the enemy, we must urgently plan assistance so that they can resist for a long time, leaving a glimmer of hope for the recovery of the Northeast, which would be a great fortune.</p>
<h3>Zeng Zhongming Came to Shanghai Yesterday Morning and Returned to Beijing the Same Evening</h3>
<p>The United Transportation Station Decided to Proceed with the Original Plan and the Pukou Ferry Will Be Completed in Early May. Zeng Zhongming, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Railways, came to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning and returned to Beijing last night after briefly discussing important official matters. A reporter from the New Voice Agency met with Mr. Zeng at the Wang residence yesterday. According to the conversation, the following points are:</p>
<p>Hosting All Sectors</p>
<p>The Zhenru United Transportation Station is of great importance to future development. Therefore, the Ministry of Railways decided to prepare and proceed according to the original plan. The reason for the delay in construction is that it is feared that the people of Zhenru and Pengpu would misunderstand too deeply. Therefore, in order to make the government's intentions clear to the area, and to avoid misunderstandings from all sectors, it has been agreed that members will be sent to Shanghai from the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Interior within a week, together with the municipal government authorities, to host all sectors and report the details so that the project can be realized as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Pukou Ferry</p>
<p>From Xiasguan to Pukou in Jing, the traffic between the two is only possible by using ferries due to the Yangtze River. After the Ministry of Railways decided to use a budget of one million yuan last year to build a ferry across the river, so that trains can travel directly to and from, it was immediately ordered from the UK, named Changjiang. According to Zeng, the ferry has been completed by the British factory and launched into the water. It will be shipped to China this month, and it is expected to be completed in early May.</p>
<p>Shipping Coal for the Navy</p>
<p>He then said that the rumor that Minister Chen's resignation was due to the Ministry of Railways stopping the transportation of coal was actually incorrect. The Ministry of Railways' method of transporting coal fees on account of the Navy was first agreed to be accounted for until the end of June last year, and then extended to December 31 last year. This time, due to the Navy's financial difficulties, the two ministers Chen and decided to postpone the account until the end of June this year, and another method was negotiated. Minister Gu notified the Ministry when he returned to Beijing to handle it accordingly. There was no suspension, and in reality, it was just a formality, and it was also central finance. Therefore, Minister Chen's resignation was only caused by external criticism, and the intention to resign will soon be dispelled.</p>
<p>Longhai Project</p>
<p>The Longhai Railway project, from Tongguan to Huayin, has been completed, and the section from Tongguan to Weilan has also started construction. It is expected to be completed in July this year, and it can reach Xi'an by the end of this year. The Longhan Railway project is still in progress. The issuance of public bonds has been decided. In the future, after the funds are raised, they will be actively rushed to build and complete the two sections, with an estimated cost of 14 million yuan, which can be completed in about four years.</p>
<p>Local Products Exhibition</p>
<p>The exhibition of local products prepared by the Ministry of Railways, according to Mr. Zeng yesterday, has collected a lot of items, which are being marked separately, and will soon be transported to Shanghai for public exhibition. The location is set in the Zhonghua Xueyi Society on Aimeiyuxian Road.</p>
<h3>Volunteer Army Support Association Telegraphed Zhu Ziqiao to Encourage All Armies</h3>
<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association telegraphed General Zhu Ziqiao yesterday, saying: 1 Zheng Zhu Ziqiao General Xun Jian, Yan Dian Feng Xi, Tai Zuo enthusiastically save the country, do not resign from hardships, personally go to the front, command the volunteer army, save the disaster, Mou Ji Fenggong, admiration and extreme. Since the establishment of the Association, it has called on the whole country to support the Northeast Volunteer Army. The money donated last year amounted to about 360,000 yuan, which was used to provide relief to various armies, and has now been spent. The area is close to the Rehe border and has repeatedly created stubborn enemies, which is gratifying. However, it is heard that the Japanese bandits have increased their troops, and the date of the general attack is not far away. It is hoped that the various armies will actively resist, seize the opportunity to turn to the offensive, and avoid repeating the mistakes of the Shanghai war. The matter concerns the overall situation, and it is hoped that the leaders will make every effort to preside over it. Special telegram of condolences, and beg to encourage all [armies to pray, the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association. Micro.</p>
<h3>County Finance Bureau Requested Extension of Winter Transportation Deadline</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County's 21st year of winter transportation money and grain (ie the second phase of land value tax), since the establishment of the County Finance Bureau's counter to collect, the two-month deadline has expired, and late payments will be subject to late payment fines. In the past, the number of winter transportation collections, once the deadline is reached, must be 70% or 80%, but this year's number of unfinished households is still huge, because the Sino-Japanese war in Shanghai last year had a great impact on all areas of the county, resulting in economic difficulties for farmers. The bureau has taken this into consideration and has telegraphed the Jiangsu Finance Department to allow an extension of the deadline to relieve the people's difficulties.</p>
<h3>Puhuitang Scheduled to Be Dredged and Officially Start Construction on the 15th of This Month</h3>
<p>The Puzhao River in western Shanghai (named Zhaojiabang east of Xujiahui and Puhuitang west of Xujiahui, the two rivers are connected, so it is called Puzhao River) has been silted up for a long time, and military navigation is impossible. Last autumn, after the old man Ma Xiangbo of 94 and Zhang Weicheng and Yang Xinzheng, specially appointed by the Songhu Rehabilitation Association, initiated the dredging of the matter, after repeated discussions, they had already prepared the method. The required funds, in addition to the Songhu War Zone Rehabilitation Committee's appropriation of 130,000 yuan, and another 160,000 yuan from Shanghai City, 14,000 yuan from Songjiang County, and 10,000 yuan from Qingpu County. The entire river project is divided into three sections: ㈠ Shanghai area from Tianlun Bridge to Jiepai Bridge, ㈡ Songqing area from Jiepai Bridge to Longgui Nunnery, and another section in Caojing area, north from Xiaozha to Caojing River. Newspaper propaganda, the public is grateful, originally scheduled to build a dam first in the winter, and choose a day to start construction, but due to various reasons, it could not be realized for a while, and the residents along the river could not avoid being greatly disappointed. Now it is found that the western section of Puhuitang (ie the eastern section of the Songqing area from Jiepai Bridge to Longgui Nunnery) has been dammed in the winter, and the river water has been drained long ago. Once the Shanghai area plan is decided, construction can start at the same time. Who would have thought that it has been delayed until now, more than a month has passed, and if it is not held again, it will have a great impact on farmers planting spring seedlings. Now, the Songqing County Government is anxious to dredge, and has specially gathered gentlemen along the river to organize the Puhuitang West Section River Dredging Committee, which unanimously decided to proceed independently, recruit villagers, and dredge in sections, and thicken the dam foundation at Jiepai Bridge to permanently block it, so as to avoid sewage inflow. All plans have been prepared, and it is heard that it will officially start construction on the 15th of this month, and it is expected that the entire river project will be completed by the end of next month.</p>
<h3>Real Estate Association's Submission to the Public Works Department to Solve the Water Fee Problem</h3>
<p>Fundamental Solution</p>
<p>The Water Company's Capital Should First Be Changed to Silver Standard and Charges Should Be Graded</p>
<p>Transitional Legislation</p>
<p>Water Fees Will Still Be Collected as Before for Two Years Until Residents Understand</p>
<p>The British-owned water company has installed water meters, resulting in a doubling of water prices. The Shanghai Real Estate Association has recently prepared a submission to the Director-General of the Public Works Department, explaining that this case should be resolved quickly to benefit the common people. The original text is copied below:</p>
<p>This submission is to solve the water fee problem. Before the Association makes any statements, it should first solemnly declare the following three points: ㈠ Solving this problem should be based on the facts of all parties and seek a feasible solution. ㈡ Solving this problem should be based on the premise of not increasing the burden on the common people. Solving this problem must be based on the principle of fairness and reasonableness, so that one party does not gain extra benefits or bear illegal obligations. The Association believes that the water company's previous calculation of water fees based on rent is the best way to adjust the rich and the poor, using the surplus paid by large households to make up for the lack of water fees paid by small households. Initially, charging at 5% has been obtained for decades, and it was increased to 6% in recent years (the Association still considers it appropriate). Later, it was increased to 7.5%. On the water company's side, the reason is that due to the relationship between gold and silver exchange rates, it is not enough to guarantee interest. There was a declaration that when the exchange rate reaches two shillings, it will be re-examined. The Association believes that public utilities should not have high interest guarantees, and there was once a protest, but the owners still paid the water fees under protest, waiting for fair compensation. Now the water company claims to save water consumption and will install total water meters uniformly, which not only overturns the principle of adjusting the rich and the poor for decades, but also according to the experience of the installed total meters, the number of charges according to the meter is four or five times more than the number calculated according to rent, or even eight times, which is tantamount to making the owners increase their burden by eight or nine times, and making the water company suddenly add eight or nine times of benefits. Public monopoly utilities should take the lives of ordinary people as the calculation standard. Guaranteed interest is not allowed to be too high, let alone after the installation of meters, the income increases sharply, which is tantamount to sucking the blood of ordinary people, so that a small number of shareholders of the water company suddenly gain illegal benefits, and get several times of the huge amount. On the basis of affection and reason, how can it be said to be fair? The only reason the water company holds is to control waste. The Association does not object to this point, but according to the facts, the amount of water used after the installation of meters is not less than before the installation of meters. The crux of the problem is that the water user is the tenant and the payer is the landlord. The tenant does not save waste because of the installation of meters, but the landlord increases the burden because of the installation of meters. The water company's meter installation method is only enough to control the landlord's life and cannot achieve the effect of saving waste. If you want to solve the landlord's difficulties, you must first explain the history of collecting water fees on behalf of the government and the responsibility of really bearing the water fees, which is implicitly attributed to the tenant. In the past, water fees were calculated based on rent, because water fees and rent have a related relationship, and also because it reduces the trouble of the water company's separate charges. Therefore, the landlord includes it in the rent and collects it on behalf of the government. The water company's position for the owners is the trustee, and the landlord's position for the water company is the trustee, and the water fee should be borne by the water user. The water company forgets its ancestors and does not know that the landlord's collection of water fees on behalf of the government is entirely for the service of the water company. It further asks the landlord to bear the obligation of bearing the water fee, and the real water user can turn away. It is generous to others, and on the basis of affection and reason, how can it be said to be fair? Controlling waste and reducing costs are sympathized by the Association, but the person who must use the water feels the increase in water fees, and then the waste can be self-controlled. The water company once declared that the installation of water meters does not hope to increase revenue, but now the facts show the opposite. The landlord is burdened for others and pays the water fee on behalf of the government, accounting for more than half of the rent received. After deducting land donations, insurance fees, and all expenses, all costs and interest are completely unaccounted for. Shanghai real estate owners are not burdened with mortgages, and follow to lose both principal and interest, and financial bankruptcy, and increasing rent has been impossible recently. Try to make the water company easy to place, and its pain is what? How about the social scene if most of the Shanghai real estate owners go bankrupt? Only care about the interests of the water company, regardless of the loss of the owners, only seek the life of the water company, not the death of the owners, on the basis of affection and reason, how can it be said to be sharp? If you want to solve the difficulties of the owners, if you do not seek a good method, the result will be that the owners increase the burden and directly add it to the users of ordinary people. The amount of water used by small households will never be less than that of large households, or even more, and the water fee will be borne, making the ordinary households equal to the large households, which is contrary to the principle of adjusting the rich and the poor. In terms of the entire population of the Shanghai Public Concession, the majority of ordinary people should account for the majority. Now that living is getting higher and higher, and there are more unemployed people, in order to maintain the survival of society, we should seek ways to help. This is not only the concern of philanthropists, but also considered an important map by politicians, and the administrative organs responsible for local affairs, how can they not plan to provide relief to seek a fair and reasonable solution? Based on the above reasons, and paying attention to Mr. Hill's report, the Association proposes the following methods: ㈠ Fundamental Solution, (A) Change the water company's capital to silver standard, hire Chinese and foreign experts, and re-estimate it. In the future, the guaranteed interest will also be based on silver standard. (B) Water is necessary for life. The water company has monopoly rights, which is different from ordinary business. In addition to guaranteed interest, it should not share dividends. (C) Install a water meter for each user, and the installation fee will be borne by the company. (D) In the future, water fees will be collected directly from the users by the company, and the landlords should deduct 7.5% from the rent. (E) Water prices should be specified separately according to the user level, with first-class Western-style houses being the highest, and so on, with fifth-class Chinese-style houses being the least. The minimum standard must not exceed the current water fee calculated based on rent. (F) The above graded water fees should be fairly stipulated by the Public Works Department, the Water Company, and the Association, each recommending one expert. (G) The contract signed by the Public Works Department and the Water Company in 1928, and the recent meter installation contract, have been found to be inapplicable and should be revised separately according to the facts. ㈡ Transitional Measures, (A) Before the fundamental measures are completed, water fees will still be calculated at 7.5% of the rent. If the exchange rate reaches two shillings, it will be re-examined. (B) Before the fundamental measures are completed, water fees will still be collected and remitted by the owners on behalf of the government. (C) The period of this transitional measure will be at least two years so that residents can understand thoroughly. The Association submits this submission not only to relieve the owners of illegal obligations, but also to reduce the burden of living for the users, and further, it is willing to express the spirit of cooperation with the water company, so that the water company can maintain considerable benefits within a fair and reasonable range. Is it appropriate? I hope that your Director-General will give full consideration, approve the method, so as to be feasible, and do not hesitate to feel excited.</p>
<h3>Qu Wenliu Reports on Disaster Relief in the Northeast</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Relief Association for Northeast Refugees held a gathering at the Gongdelin yesterday at 6 PM to welcome Mr. Qu Wenliu, who arrived in Shanghai from Beiping, and to bid farewell to Mr. Feng Yangshan, who is about to go north. More than 20 people attended, including Xu Jingren, Wang Yiting, Huang Hanzhi, Huang Bodu, and Qian Jingping. Mr. Qu gave a detailed report on the disaster relief situation in the Northeast, excerpted as follows: The war at Yuguan broke out, and the ice and snow were severe. Furthermore, it was the end of the year. Thinking of the compatriots in eastern Hebei, my heart ached with anger. Wenliu and Mr. Tian Zhongtao went to the front line to investigate and seek relief. On January 20th, Mr. Tian arrived in Tianjin first, and together with Zeng Xiangjiu, Zhang Yuqi, and Xin Xiangxian, went to Qinhuangdao to investigate and fill out forms for distribution. On January 25th, Wenliu arrived in Tianjin. Considering that the situation along the Beining Railway line east of Changli was tense, it was difficult to find a safe area for relief. If refugees were given aid in the morning but died in the evening, it would not be a perfect solution. Through the introduction of Mr. Li Zishen and others, I met with Mr. Nathanson, the British General Manager of the Kaiyuan Mining Bureau, and Mr. Zhao, the associate manager. They kindly provided a letter to Qi Erdun and Luo Xuchao, the managers in Qinhuangdao, requesting special care and assistance. Lou Xiangqing, a director of Kaiyuan, accompanied me. At 7:30 PM on the 26th, we arrived in Qin. It was already dark, and there were no pedestrians on the road. Japanese warships shone searchlights on the sea from time to time. Fortunately, the barracks had not yet posted sentries. I was invited by Mr. Luo Xuchao to stay at the Nanshan Hotel. I had a very pleasant conversation with Mr. Luo. I filled out the relief tickets all night. On the morning of the 27th, Wenliu visited Qi Erdun with Mr. Lou, and the results were satisfactory. Mr. Qi and Mr. Luo agreed to serve as the chief and deputy directors of the Association in Qin, and they also introduced staff and allocated factory buildings to serve as shelters for refugees, which could accommodate three to four thousand people. At 2 PM, we went to the Milk Room New Kaihe seaside to distribute relief. Staff from the Red Swastika Society also assisted. The refugees all dug holes and built simple huts. The soil was saline, and fires could not be lit. The ground was frozen and cracked. Men, women, old, and young all huddled together for warmth, but it was not really warm. The wind was strong at night, and people died easily. The relief was distributed according to the names on the tickets, and everyone was very happy. It is planned to open porridge kitchens in the spring to provide a continuous source of relief. It is heard that the number of refugees has increased recently due to the expansion of the war zone and the extension of the war. Currently, from Rehe Lengkou to the seaside, and from Shihe to Qianzhou, there are over 100,000 troops, digging trenches and demolishing houses, all for war preparations. If the situation persists, these people who have been displaced will surely starve to death. On the morning of the 28th, I met with Commander He Zhuguo at the Public Security Bureau north of the Haiyangzhen Road. Mr. He spoke earnestly about military affairs and proposed relief measures for refugees in the military zone. Wenliu immediately allocated 4,000 yuan, 1,000 sets of cotton clothing, and 100 cotton vests for relief to refugees in the war zone. Representatives from the Beiping Education Association also arrived. We talked until 12 PM before I returned to Qin Island and took a fast train back to Tianjin. Although this trip only lasted three days, the future relief efforts in the war zone and non-war zone will be very effective. I only hope that peace will come soon, so that the people can recover. Otherwise, if the flames of war spread, even if the Association exhausts its resources for relief, it may still be difficult to cover everyone, and the risks involved may make it difficult to meet urgent needs. During this trip to Beiping and Tianjin, I received 90,000 yuan from the Association, which has all been distributed according to the plans of the Association. The unexpectedly satisfactory outcome of this trip is something for the Northeast refugees to celebrate and is due to the sincerity of everyone.</p>
<h3>Speed Up the Construction of Lianyungang to Facilitate the Smooth Transportation of Northwest Grains to South China</h3>
<p>Since the opening of Haizhou Port, the Longhai Railway freight has become more convenient. Goods from Shaanxi and Gansu can be directly transported. However, the only seaport in Haizhou, Dapu, is often silted up due to excessive sand and mud. Last year, it was even worse. Ocean-going vessels with deeper drafts cannot enter the port with a full load of cargo and are prone to grounding. This hinders the Longhai Railway transport. Last year, the Longhai Railway Bureau specifically discussed improving the port and opening a new port to facilitate transportation. Xugou has been surveyed and renamed Lianyungang. Construction is underway and will soon be completed. The Shanghai China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has a joint transportation relationship with the Longhai Railway. Taking advantage of the construction of this new port, it is also urgently seeking to develop the shipping industry in Haizhou. Liu Hongsheng has specifically appointed Shen Youzhi as the director of the Haizhou branch and instructed him to investigate in order to build wharves and warehouses as a basis for permanent operations and to make our country's only seaport not bound by unequal treaties a hub for the development of transportation and commerce in the Northwest. The current situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Grains Arriving in Large Quantities: Since the Japanese occupation of the Northeast, grain merchants from Shantou, Guangdong, Xiamen, and other places have changed to purchasing soybeans, soybean cakes, raw oil, peanuts, and miscellaneous grains from the Northwest to make up for the losses. In recent months, eastbound trains on the Longhai Railway have been fully loaded with these oil beans and miscellaneous grains, which are stored in warehouses in Haizhou and then transferred by ship to Shanghai and other ports in South China. As a result, a large amount of miscellaneous grains has accumulated in Haizhou and is currently stored in Dapu. However, due to the shallow water and siltation, ships cannot be loaded smoothly, so the Railway Bureau is trying to dredge and rebuild the tracks. Speeding up the Construction of Lianyungang: The Xugou surveyed by the Longhai Railway Bureau is located northeast of Dapu, about 40 miles away. It is a natural harbor in Haizhou, with deep water and year-round ice-free conditions, making it an excellent seaport for large vessels to enter and exit. In the past, the Longhai Railway Bureau had an agreement with a Dutch company to open a commercial port there, which would require 20 million yuan. Now, the Railway Bureau is first laying railway tracks to the Xugou port to facilitate the transportation of goods to the port and to facilitate unloading. The port has been renamed Lianyungang. The track laying project is progressing rapidly and should be completed in about two to three months.</p>
<p>Shipping Issues: Shipping companies in Shanghai that operate to Haizhou, such as the Dazhen Company, are also planning to move their wharves to Xugou when Lianyungang opens to traffic in order to transport goods from the Northwest. As for Shen Youzhi, the director of the Haizhou branch of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, after investigating, has returned to Shanghai to submit a report to the company, requesting that a large warehouse be purchased in Chenjiagang near Xilian Island so that when the Lianyungang railway is connected, the company's ships can directly connect to transport goods. In peacetime, Chenjiagang can also be used as a central point for the transportation of Huai salt to Hubei, with annual sales of 300,000 tons, which can also be handled by the company's ships, killing two birds with one stone. This matter is already being planned. It is expected that the railway tracks in Lianyungang can be completed after April this year, and the transportation of goods from the Northwest will be smooth from then on. At that time, the large amount of miscellaneous grains unloaded in Haizhou can be loaded onto large ocean-going vessels from Lianyungang and directly shipped to Shantou, Xiamen, and other ports in Guangdong, avoiding the need to transfer to Shanghai for export, which saves water and time.</p>
<h3>The Ministry's Reply Regarding the Wusong Ship Case</h3>
<p>Urged the Shanghai and Wuhan Municipal Governments to Handle the Matter</p>
<p>Mutual Aid Society Responds to the Seamen's Party Branch</p>
<p>Regarding the case of the British Taikoo Company's Wusong ship expelling the mid-cabin workers, the labor side had petitioned in Beijing on the 30th of last month. Yesterday, the Ministry of Industry issued a reply stating that it had separately sent letters to the Shanghai and Wuhan Municipal Governments to handle the matter. It is also heard that all the stewards of the ship took other ships to Wuhan yesterday, preparing to board the Wusong ship to work as usual when it docks in Wuhan.</p>
<p>Ministry of Industry's Reply: Reply to Gao Yongliu, representative of the distressed mid-cabin seamen of the Wusong ship. It has been understood that the matter has been forwarded to the Shanghai Municipal Government for investigation and handling, and the Wuhan Municipal Government has been instructed to provide proper protection and strictly comply with the instructions. This is the reply.</p>
<p>Mutual Aid Society's Report: The Chinese Seamen's Mutual Aid Society, after receiving instructions from the Seamen's Party Branch, specially submitted a reply yesterday after negotiating with the company. The original text is omitted. Report on the matter of reply. The instructions in your association's No. 40 states (omitted). Upon receiving this, the sudden incident on the Wusong ship, the sudden expulsion of the mid-cabin workers, and the involvement of the business director in the disaster, both parties should cooperate with each other to achieve the goal of recovery. However, the workers did not consider this and instead viewed the business director, whom they had always hated, as the capitalist and made malicious accusations, pointing him as the instigator. Although the association explained in detail, they turned a deaf ear and instead accused him of harming and detaining the accountant. Their trampling on human rights and playing with the law is already abominable. Instead of seeking a solution to the matter, they indulged in private grievances and were laughed at by foreigners. The association, considering that its members have suffered such an unusual humiliation, was unwilling to make any claims. However, considering the livelihood of the workers, it could not stand idly by. Therefore, it still endured the humiliation and repeatedly negotiated with Taikoo based on the facts, hoping for a turning point. However, the company's attitude was firm, stating that the stewards had always been excessively harsh on passengers and insulted the captain, causing travelers to be afraid and greatly damaging business. Furthermore, the business directors of each ship were unable to improve the situation. The company, following the instructions of the head office, was determined to rectify the situation at any cost and would not change its mind. Please do not waste your breath. They also said that although the stewards were introduced by the compradors, who listens to the compradors' commands? Since there is no fixed-term contract, they can be dismissed at any time according to the law. They are employed for service and do not have specialized skills, so they can find work anywhere. They cannot be compared with workers. They were completely rejected, and there was no way to turn the situation around. The association's representatives were almost exhausted, but the negotiations were still ineffective. The association's good intentions could not gain the sympathy of the workers, nor could it gain the understanding of your association, resulting in accusations of deliberate evasion. I am deeply regretful. Based on the original intention of the association, we should strive to follow the instructions. However, I do not know what examples to follow in order to make the negotiations serious and achieve the goal of recovery. Furthermore, I do not know what means to use to prevent the occurrence of similar incidents and eliminate hidden dangers in the future. My abilities are limited, and I have no solutions. I can only respectfully request your instructions and await your orders. I am extremely apprehensive. I respectfully submit this report.</p>

<h3>Yuezhou Road Police Engaged in a Fierce Gunfight with Robbers, One Robber Shot and Captured</h3>
<p>Bullets Flew on Tongzhou Road, Injuring Three People</p>
<p>The Injured Robber Rushed into a Printing House Hoping to Escape</p>
<p>The Robber Was Discovered Under a Quilt on the Bed and Captured</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, a robbery occurred on Yuezhou Road. When the robbers left with their loot, the victim shouted for help and chased after them, resulting in a fierce gunfight. One robber was shot and captured on the spot, and stray bullets injured three passersby. The details of the incident are described below:</p>
<p>The Victim Shouted for Help After Being Robbed: Quanji Pig Slaughterhouse, owned by Lu Shuiquan, is located at No. 14 Fengming Lane on Yuezhou Road. At around 12 noon yesterday, six robbers suddenly entered the slaughterhouse. Five of them had guns, and one was unarmed. After entering, they used their guns to threaten everyone and prevent them from making noise. They assigned robbers to watch over the staff and the foreman, while the remaining robbers searched the rooms and the boss's bedroom upstairs, ransacking boxes and wardrobes. All the jewelry of the owner's wife, Mrs. Fang, was also robbed. The total loss is estimated to be over 1,000 yuan. The robbers searched for about an hour and then tried to escape. Seeing that her lifelong savings had been robbed, the owner's wife ignored the danger and chased them downstairs. She ran to the entrance and saw the robbers just leaving the lane. Fearing that they would escape, she rushed forward and shouted wildly, "Catch the robbers!"</p>
<p>One Robber Shot and Fled: Hearing the shouts from behind, the robbers knew that something was wrong and scattered to escape. One of the robbers, seeing the dangerous situation, noticed a rickshaw parked by the roadside and jumped on it without asking, urging the driver to flee. At this time, nearby police officers had received the alert and blew their whistles. As a result, a group of police officers gathered and chased towards Yuezhou Road. Seeing this, the robbers ran wildly west along Yuezhou Road. When they saw the police officers closing in, they turned into a small alley west of Fengming Lane and tried to escape. However, the police officers continued to pursue them. In desperation, the robbers pulled out their guns and returned fire. The police officers also returned fire. After a brief exchange, one robber was shot but continued to flee east. The remaining robbers took advantage of the chaos and fled to secluded places. The police officers continued to chase east.</p>
<p>Pretending to Be a Patient on the Bed: The injured robber, seeing that he was still being chased, was extremely panicked and chose the wrong path. He ran back to Yuezhou Road and to the front of the Huasheng Printing House at No. 24. Seeing that the front door was wide open, the robber rushed in and ran straight upstairs. Seeing that the rooms were all workers' bunks, he had an idea. He jumped onto a bunk, covered himself with a quilt, and pretended to be a patient. The workers downstairs were shocked by the situation and asked him questions. The robber stammered and waved them away, refusing to leave. The workers discussed the matter and decided to report it to the police. The Jiuxing Road Police Station received the report and immediately dispatched Chief Detective Henry and a large number of detectives. On the way, they met the Chinese police officers who were chasing the robbers and joined them at No. 24. Chief Detective Xi first went upstairs and arrested the robber. Opening the quilt, he saw bloodstains on the robber's body and found a pistol under him. After being identified by the police officers who were chasing him, it was confirmed that he was the escaping robber. The robber was taken to the police station.</p>
<p>Three People Injured by Stray Bullets: According to the robber, his name is Chen A'gen, 34 years old, from Ningbo. He confessed to the robbery. He was shot in the abdomen. The police station saw that his injuries were serious and immediately sent him to the Tongren Hospital for treatment. He will be interrogated after he recovers. Additional detectives have been dispatched to track down his accomplices. During the gunfight, bullets flew on Tongzhou Road. Stray bullets hit Yuezhou Road. At that time, a woman from Tongzhou, Cao Mengshi, was returning from incense with her son when they passed by the area. She was grazed by a stray bullet on her right face and right ear. A child, Xie Shanquan, 8 years old, from Ningbo, who lived at No. 46 Tongzhou Road, was watching idly at the entrance of his uncle's house when he was shot in the right calf by a stray bullet. A butcher, Cai Mingrong, 30 years old, from Chongming, was also chasing behind the police officers when the robbers fled towards Tongzhou Road, and he was shot in the right neck by a stray bullet. The police station sent police officers to take everyone to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Various Forms of Gambling</h3>
<p>Evil Habits of the Lunar New Year</p>
<p>Gambling Everywhere, from Hotels to Homes</p>
<p>Pai Gow Gambling Den: Ningbo native Lu Weiqing recently set up a Pai Gow gambling den in room 79 on the third floor of the Chunjiang Hotel at No. 6 Xixinqiao Street, inviting Zhang A'san, Liu Shangzhi, Xu Jinhai, Yang Xiaolong, Lu Guixing, Zhao Jindi, and six others to gamble inside, collecting a rake. Detective Li Yousheng and Deputy Detective Liu Kunbao of the Gambling Arrest Squad of the French Concession Police Station discovered this and rushed to the scene, seizing Pai Gow gambling tools and dozens of yuan in gambling money, and taking the owner and gamblers into custody. The gamblers were each ordered to deposit 9 yuan in bail, while the owner was detained and then sent to the Second Special Court Criminal Division II for prosecution. Under interrogation, Lu Weiqing confessed to gathering people to gamble and collecting a rake. Judge Zhang Rentan verified the confession and sentenced Lu Weiqing to a fine of 60 yuan for the crime of gathering people to gamble for profit, and the gambling tools and money were confiscated.</p>
<p>Hotel Gambling: Detectives Li Yousheng of the Gambling Arrest Squad of the French Concession Police Station, having learned that someone was privately setting up a gambling den in room 301 of the Hong Kong Hotel on Zhengjia Muqiao, Avenue Edward VII, led detectives to the hotel the night before and arrested the owner Gu A'san and six gamblers, seizing Pai Gow gambling tools and money, and taking them to the police station to be sent to the Second Special Court for prosecution. Under interrogation, Gu A'san confessed to gathering people to gamble and collecting a rake. The judge sentenced Gu A'san to a fine of 90 yuan for gathering people to gamble, and the gambling tools and money were confiscated.</p>
<p>Shaking Stand and Collecting Rake: Wei Jiezhen, the patrol officer of the Second Sub-Station of the Sixth District in West Shanghai's Zhoujiaqiao, learned on the morning of yesterday that someone was opening a gambling den in No. 37 Chunyang Lane in the town to shake a stand and collect a rake. He immediately supervised all the patrol officers to secretly go to the address. He arrested 50 gambling criminals, including Li Ziming, Wu A'er, Ren Zhonglin, Chen A'san, Ding Xida, Xie A'da, Liu Jinzhi, Feng Yutang, Xu Hongze, Zhang Yaode, Zhang A'bing, Zhu Fulin, Ye Yide, Zhou Rongxiang, Zhang Deyu, Zhou A'hong, Wang A'lin, Chen A'da, Tang A'er, Yang Shunlin, Yao Zecai, Ni Youtang, and Liu Jinbiao, along with the gambling tools and money, and took them to the Sixth District Police Station.

<p>Gathering to Gamble Pai Gow: Also, at around 8:10 PM the night before, District Chief Tan of the Sixth District ordered Police Chief Song Ziming to lead police officers to No. 74 Xinkang Lane on Connaught Road, where they arrested 13 Pai Gow gamblers, including Wang Xuewu, Cai Liqing, and Shen Baoqing, and took them to the district police station along with the gambling tools. After District Officer Jiang interrogated them, they were fined separately as a warning.</p>
<h3>Fake Diamond Ring Case</h3>
<p>Wang A'xi Can't Escape the Long Arm of the Law</p>
<p>Wang Houchang Is Smart</p>
<p>Recently, some rascals have been specializing in using fake diamond rings, diamond circles, diamond bracelets, and other valuable ornaments to pawn at various pawnshops in the north and south of the city. These diamonds are made very skillfully, with a radiance that is very similar to real diamonds. They are also paired with gold or platinum bases and exquisite and beautiful boxes, making them difficult to distinguish. Therefore, pawnshop employees are easily deceived, and not a few people have been tricked. Earlier, at the Xielai pawnshop on Sanpailou Huajin Road in the city, a man came with a fake diamond ring to pawn for 200 yuan. The pawnshop employee, Wang Houchang, from Anhui, did not notice the deception and accepted the fake diamond ring and paid out 200 yuan. The man took the money and left. Later, the pawnshop staff examined the ring in detail and discovered that it was fake. However, the man was nowhere to be found, and they had to admit their bad luck and complain. Unexpectedly, after the man left, he thought that the pawnshop was easy to fool with this type of fake jewelry. Yesterday afternoon at around 6 PM, he came again with a similar fake diamond ring to pawn at the pawnshop. It happened to be Wang's turn again. Wang noticed that it was the same style as the previous fake diamond ring. After carefully examining the man's appearance, he recognized him as the man who had pawned the fake ring last time. Wang asked how much he wanted to pawn it for. The man said he wanted to pawn it for 250 yuan. Wang said okay, please wait a moment. He immediately rushed out of the counter, grabbed the man, and handed him over to An Xueshi, the police officer on duty at the Second Station. The police chief, Yu Fanshi, questioned the man, who identified himself as Wang A'xi, 21 years old, from Wuxi, living at No. 111 Xuelongdi. He admitted to pawning the fake diamond ring. He was ordered to prepare a document and send it to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Seventeen-Year-Old Robber Organized Robberies</h3>
<p>A Young and Handsome Robber</p>
<p>The Decline of Social Morality Is Truly Sad</p>
<p>A young robber, Xiao Tinggui, 17 years old, a local from Shanghai, lives on Cangqiao Street outside Xiaonanmen. On the 4th and 12th of last month, he organized Ni Rong (small Chongming), Xia Baosheng, and others (who are still at large) to rob Yang A'si at No. 122 Wangzhi Road and Qian Haoliang at No. 22 Yinhe Lane on Min'guo Road, using weapons and dividing the loot. On the evening of the 12th, he organized five people to rob Sun Lvshi, a Shaoxing woman, in Shenxing Lane on Min'guo Road in the French Concession. Xiao led the way with a gun, using white cloth strips to tie up the victim's family members before robbing them of money and jewelry. When the victim's relative, Liang Guixi, blew a police whistle, the robbers, led by Xiao, fired four shots to resist arrest, hitting Liang's left hand. Hearing the whistle and gunfire, the robbers panicked and desperately ran downstairs, but the victim closed the door, capturing Xiao. The gun was taken and turned over to the detectives, who took him to the police station. Later, two accomplices, Yang Xiaosanzi (the victim Sun Lvshi's cohabitant) and Zhang Zijin, were arrested at the Hong Kong Hotel and sent to the Second Special District Court for trial and detention for investigation. On the morning of the previous day, an emergency executive supervisory committee meeting was held at the Jiangxi Guild Hall on the Two Cities to discuss solutions for Mr. Liu Junshen. Attendees included Li Liejun, Sun Ya, Zhang Ding, Wu Mai, and representatives from the business community. The meeting was presided over by Li Liejun. Wu Mai first reported on the events of Gu Zhutong framing Mr. Liu. Then, the discussion began. It was resolved that the Jiangxi Shanghai Fellow Association, the Jiangxi Public Association, the Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association, and other groups would jointly send a telegram to the government, requesting that Gu Zhutong be dismissed from his post and severely punished. Wu Mai was tasked with drafting the telegram. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3>Philippines Increases Import Taxes on Eggs, Approved by the Philippine Congress</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce received a letter from the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry yesterday, which read: Respected sirs, It has been approved that the Consulate General in Manila's Letter No. 3224 states that the Philippine Congress has passed three tariff proposals to increase import tax rates on eggs and other items, as well as the tax payment exchange rate. The bureau was notified in the past. It has been found that this revision of tariffs affects all countries that trade with the Philippines, except for the United States. This consulate and the Japanese consul in the Philippines have communicated with the relevant parties, but the Philippine Congress used the protection of local products and the increase of tax revenue to make up for the budget deficit as slogans, so the proposal was passed. Now, each proposal has been forwarded to the United States by the Philippine governor. On December 21, it was approved by the US President and is now being implemented as usual. We are informing you accordingly, hoping that you will take note of it. This letter was received earlier, and after discussion with the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Egg Industry Association, a method of resistance was planned and reported to the Ministry of Industry. According to the letter, in addition to reporting to the Ministry, we are informing you accordingly, hoping that you will take note of it. Addressed to the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce.</p>

<h3>Two Major Russian and Japanese Department Stores Coming Soon</h3>
<p>One on Avenue Joffre or Avenue Foch</p>
<p>One at the Corner of Woosung Road and Paoshan Road</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that the department store scene in this city is experiencing a surge of activity. Recently, three major plans have emerged. It is rumored that a certain merchant on Nanjing Road has been in contact with a local dealer specializing in Russian goods, planning to raise 2 million yuan to build a large department store in the French Concession. Its location will be on Avenue Joffre or Avenue Foch. Once completed, it will exclusively sell Soviet Russian products. Additionally, a certain church is also planning to build a large department store, with a scale comparable to the planned Wing On and Sincere department stores. One is planned for the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Tibet Road, and the other at the intersection of Route Tenant de la Tour and Avenue Dubail. Currently, progress is temporarily stalled due to the search for two small land plots in the French Concession that have not yet been acquired. Furthermore, a large department store is also being built at the corner of Woosung Road and Paoshan Road. The plans are now finalized. The building will be several stories high and construction is expected to begin within two months, with completion anticipated by the end of the year. It is rumored that Japanese interests are backing this project, and it will exclusively sell Japanese goods in the future. The previous two plans are not yet fully mature at this time, and their construction commencement dates are also undetermined. The case of Li Changnian was continued for trial at the criminal court. First, the police lawyer Gu Shouxi stated the police's investigation during the postponement, prosecuting under Article 343, Article 346, Article 348, Article 351, etc., of the Criminal Law for crimes such as robbery with injury by a gang of three or more. The evidence, including a handgun and white cloth strips, was presented. Furthermore, various victims successively testified that the first defendant, Xiao Tinggui, held the gun and led the robbery. When questioned, Xiao confessed that he was invited by the fugitives Ni Rong, Zhu Liansheng, Xiao Chongming, etc., to rob the Sun Lü family home, instigated by Yang Xiaosanzi, etc. Yang Xiaosanzi and Zhang Zijin gave cunning testimonies. The court ordered a postponement to the 8th of this month, appointing a defense lawyer for further questioning. The defendants were remanded.</p>

<h3>Thugs Demand Protection Money and Assault Vendor</h3>
<p>Recently, a vendor set up a Cifan (sticky rice roll) stall near the Zhizhong Lane entrance on Avenue des Deux Republiques in the French Concession. For several days, business was quite good. However, a group of idlers and good-for-nothings in the area, forming groups of three or five, demanded protection money, also known as "cigarette money," from the Cifan vendor at around 10 AM yesterday. The vendor, seeking to make a profit from his capital, refused to pay. The thugs became aggressive, saying that they would not allow him to set up his Cifan stall and that even if he opened a shop, he would still have to treat them as "old friends." A long argument ensued. Initially, it was verbal, but it soon escalated into physical violence. Because the Cifan vendor was outnumbered, he was struck in the head with a high stool by the thugs, causing a bloody wound. Seeing that they had caused trouble, the thugs attempted to flee in all directions. Fortunately, bystanders stepped in to defend the vendor and apprehended the thug who had committed the assault. His accomplices attempted to obstruct and snatch him back, but bystanders blew whistles to alert the police. A patrolling policeman arrived and took both the assailant and the injured vendor to the police station for investigation.</p>
<h3>Shareholder Dispute Leads to Assault Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Yin Geru, a shareholder of the Shashi Yarn Weaving Company, accused Li Yushan, the company's general manager, of embezzlement, private gain, and falsification of accounts, and filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Court. The trial has been opened once, as reported in the newspaper. Previously, Yin Geru held 10,000 yuan worth of shares in the company. Because the company had been established for three years and had made a profit of over 700,000 yuan, Li Yushan had never convened a shareholders' meeting to distribute dividends or allocate bonuses. Therefore, Yin wanted to sell his shares. Li found a buyer for him, and a date was set for December 7th at the Shashi Textile Company office in the Sanhe Lane on Jiangxi Road for the transfer. Yin's shares were originally mortgaged to the Chongming Datong Bank for 3,000 yuan. Since Yin had to sell the shares, the bank manager Du Shaoru had the shares sent to Du Lunjiu, the accountant of the Shashi Company, and temporarily requested Yin to pay the mortgage and interest of 3,066 yuan. When the transfer date arrived, Yin and a friend went to the office. Manager Li Yushan ordered accountant Yu Yingle to deduct the amount of the mortgage and interest that Yin had to repay and issue a demand draft for 6,934 yuan and instructed Yin to stamp the shares with a transfer seal. Yin received the bank draft and immediately handed it to his friend who accompanied him, instructing him to go to the Shanghai Bank for verification and payment. Meanwhile, Yin demanded dividends and bonuses from Li Yushan, amounting to about 5,000 yuan. Li refused. Yin then refused to stamp the shares. At this point, Li and Yu, seeing that Yin had already taken the bank draft but suddenly refused to stamp the shares, feared that the payment would be wasted. They immediately ordered a clerk to rush to the Shanghai Bank to cash the draft and accused Yin of deception, intending to call the police. The matter was resolved through mediation. Yin also stamped his shares that were being sold, and the turmoil subsided. The next day, Yin filed a complaint with the prosecutor's office of the First Special District Court, claiming that he had been beaten on the forehead and chest by Li and Yu, and requested an examination. After an examination by the prosecutor and the medical examiner, a minor injury was found. Yin then hired lawyer E Sen to sue Li Yushan and Yu Yingle for joint assault in the First Special Court. The trial was opened by Judge Zhan Liang at noon the day before yesterday. According to Yin's testimony, he was slapped on the cheek by Yu and punched in the chest by Li. Lu Wenbin was also invited to testify. According to Lu, who went with Yin that day, he witnessed Li and Yu's insults and abuse of Yin. Both defendants denied the assault. The witnesses they invited also said that they did not see Li and others commit the assault at the time. After the defense lawyer Fan Gang and the plaintiff's lawyer concluded their arguments, the judge ordered a scheduled sentencing.</p>

<h3>"Thieves" and "Death"</h3>
<p>丨Letter from Zhu Yingjun丨</p>
<p>I fully sympathize with Mr. Qian Xing's letter in your column on January 23rd. And the reporter's reply is also very correct. However, there is one point, the reporter said: "There is also another way, to be a thief, but to be a thief, the light one will be imprisoned, and the heavy one will be shot, and the result is also death. When choosing between two evils, take the lesser one. Doing hard labor can always save one's life." Naturally, it is not worth sacrificing one's life to be an unrighteous thief; but doing hard labor may not be able to "save one's life"! Because Mr. Wu is a weak body, if he does hard labor, his body will be squeezed, and his spirit will feel painful. Over time, he may be tortured to death. Naturally, I am not saying that Mr. Gan should not do hard labor, but rather than doing hard labor and being tortured to death, it is better to do a social reform undertaking wholeheartedly and be opposed by others to death. As the saying goes: "Death can be heavier than Mount Tai, or lighter than a feather." The former death is like a feather, and the latter death is like Mount Tai. Moreover, Mr. Wu ran away from home precisely because he was afraid of death. In other words, his weakness lies in this. We should break this concept of his and not use the problem of life and death to shake him. We are born in the current China, and the god of death is always grinning at our sides. Therefore, we should not only not be afraid of death, but also cannot escape it, but we must ask whether death is justified and whether death is worthwhile. This column specializes in solving personal problems for readers, but it is precisely a social problem. You must know that reforming a society cannot be achieved overnight. It must go through many twists and turns and difficulties. How much effort must be made to obtain it! But I am not saying that in order to solve problems for each person, they must be sacrificed. However, at least we can't use the words "save one's life" to reduce their courage to fight. Jesus was nailed to the cross, and Roland was guillotined. No matter what kind of king is to be achieved, it is always inevitable to sacrifice a few people. And this kind of death is glorious, great, and beautiful. Otherwise, what is the meaning of dying after being sick for a few days and suffering the oppression and insults of demons throughout one's life journey? Furthermore, I would like to ask, to which class does Mr. Wu belong? If he is on the side of the oppressors, then his current plight of running away and being unable to survive is the inevitable result of his years of enjoyment; otherwise, he can only go home and use his spirit of hard labor to participate in the struggle. Therefore, the reporter does not want Mr. Wu to be a thief, but I want him to be a thief, but to be a big one, not a small one, to be beneficial to the masses, not to be harmful to the masses.</p>
<p>Reporter's note: In our last reply to Mr. Wu's letter, we asked him to do hard labor. This was really a last resort. We would have liked to tell him the kind of words that Zhu Yingjun said, but we were afraid that the argument would be too lofty and would disappoint him, so we only said a few words on the practical side. Now we are very grateful for Mr. Zhu's letter of instruction! Naturally, the "thieves" that Mr. Zhu is talking about are by no means the general so-called "thieves", but a class of great brave men who reform society. This kind of "thief" is indeed worth our doing. Mr. Zhu also pointed out a path of "life" and "death", calling on us all to pursue a "great death". This is indeed something for us to savor.</p>

<h3>Paris Chinese Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>丨 Lectures on Chinese Art During the Exhibition 丨</p>
<p>This time our country is preparing a Chinese painting exhibition in Paris, with Li Shizeng, Xu Beihong, and Liu Dabei as the main organizers. Mr. Xu Beihong already took more than 300 paintings and sailed to France on January 28th. Hundreds of people, including Wu Zhihui, Zhang Ji, and Wang Yiting, saw him off, as reported in previous newspapers. Now, we have learned that Mr. Liu Dabei, director of the Paris Chinese World Academy office, sent a letter to Mr. Xu, which describes the preparations in detail. Excerpts are as follows: (omitted above) The name of the painting exhibition, as you suggested, is "Chinese Contemporary Painting Exhibition," but the organizer, Elder Shi (Mr. Xu Shizeng), thought it was inappropriate to only write "Sino-French University," because the school's financial strength is very weak and it cannot independently fund the entire painting exhibition. Therefore, he specifically extended your suggested phrase "Collection of the Sino-French University" to "Chinese Contemporary Art Exhibition Organized by the World Society," and for the sake of connection, added the title "Sponsored by Chinese Celebrities So-and-So and French Celebrities So-and-So." After the name was decided, I immediately proceeded to discuss matters with the Musée de Teude Paume. (omitted in the middle) Master Shi mentioned to Mr. Pomaret, President of the Paris World Academy, our intention to organize a painting exhibition. He greatly approved and specially instructed the secretary of the academy's art department to contact the French Undersecretary of Fine Arts and the Director-General of the National Museum, Mr. Fannar, etc. Yesterday afternoon, we received Mr. Dussaulx (Curator of the Musée de Teude Paume)'s agreement to lend the venue. The results of the discussion are roughly as follows: (1) The first floor of the Musée de Teude Paume, about eight rooms, will be fully used; (2) The exhibition will last for three weeks; (omitted in the middle) (3) The exhibits must be purely representative of Chinese art, not Europeanized or Japanized; 150 to 300 paintings; (4) In addition to modern paintings, collect some ancient Chinese paintings, about enough to display in a small room, so that visitors can compare and study ancient and modern art; (omitted in the middle) (5) In addition to paintings, such as modern sculptures, anything that can represent the times is welcome to be collected and sent for decoration; (omitted in the middle) (6) During the painting exhibition, we plan to organize a Chinese art lecture series, inviting Chinese and foreign celebrities to talk about Chinese art for publicity. (omitted below) and so on.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Municipal Government Strictly Prohibits Corporal Punishment of Children</h3>
<p>If Teachers Still Use Corporal Punishment</p>
<p>The Principal Shall Be Jointly Punished</p>
<p>In order to strictly prohibit corporal punishment of naughty students in various schools, the Hangzhou Municipal Government issued an order to the principals of private primary schools in the city on the 3rd, stating: "Primary school education should adopt a positive, touching, and guiding approach, and minimize negative intervention methods. If corporal punishment is used for children who are more naughty in order to punish their transgressions and violent behavior, it not only goes against educational principles but also proves the failure of primary school education. Although beating is used as a 'teaching punishment,' the ancients regarded it as a clear instruction, but it is inappropriate to use it in modern education. The government has repeatedly issued orders to prohibit corporal punishment, and primary schools should deeply understand the government's intention to protect children and absolutely eliminate this long-standing bad habit. However, it has been found that in the past year, a few schools have still used corporal punishment. This is regrettable. A further circular is hereby issued as a warning. If teachers in various schools still use corporal punishment as a method of punishing students' mistakes after investigation, they will be severely punished, and the principals of the schools will also be jointly responsible. Do not disobey this order."</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Government Replies to Chairman Chiang, Unable to Bear Zhejiang University's Expenses</h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang telegraphed the provincial government, stating that before the central government fully bears the expenses of National Zhejiang University, Zhejiang should still bear a portion. The Department of Finance stated that this amount was not included in this year's budget after austerity measures and that the provincial treasury was extremely tight and unable to bear it. A factual reply has been telegraphed.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Department of Education Orders Middle Schools to Stop Handling Enrollment for Other Schools</h3>
<p>Except for Public Universities or Vocational Schools Entrusted</p>
<p>By the Department or Approved by the Department</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Department of Education recently stated that schools in the province accept entrustments from other schools to handle enrollment. Often, they do not carefully examine the other schools' operations, which can easily lead to abuses. It should be clearly prohibited to avoid misleading young people. It is stipulated that in the future, except for entrustments from public universities or vocational schools to handle enrollment, which are handled by the Department, or with the approval of the Department, no schools may accept entrustments from any school to handle enrollment. Yesterday, special orders were issued to all joint private middle schools in the province, counties, and cities to comply.</p>
<h3>News from the Ministry of Education</h3>
<p>The recent news from the Ministry of Education is recorded below: (1) The Jiangsu Provincial Government was informed that the Ministry of Education had approved the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education's submission of revised regulations for the organization of Jiangsu Provincial Normal School. Before the Ministry issues regulations, provisional filing is permitted, and notification should be given immediately; (2) The Preparatory Committee for the Northwest Agricultural and Forestry College sent a letter stating that the committee intends to request Shen Pengfei to go to inspect the Northwest Agricultural and Forestry College and agricultural and forestry fields. Please grant him two weeks of public leave.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Actively Compiling the China Education Yearbook</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education is compiling the China Education Yearbook. Because it is the first time, the content is complex and the materials are not easy to gather at once. Therefore, although it was expected to be completed by the end of the 21st year, the materials submitted by various provinces and cities were not uniformly complete. Sometimes the materials sent lacked overall statistics or needed to be cleared and recompiled, which delayed the time. This yearbook is divided into five categories. Category A, General Overview of Education, is written by the National Compilation and Translation Bureau and is now largely completed. Category B, Educational Laws and Regulations, the Department of Advisors of the Ministry of Education will organize all educational laws and regulations, which can be completed soon. Category C, General Education Situation, is divided into higher education, general education, and social education. The materials on higher education and universities are limited, while the materials on general education, primary and secondary schools, and various aspects of social education are completely sent only by Henan Province and Shanghai City (Xiang Jutan brought Jiangsu's materials from the current National Mass Education Conference). More than ten provinces, including Anhui, Fujian, Hunan, Shandong, and Henan, have submitted incomplete materials. In addition, some provinces, such as Guangdong, have not submitted any materials at all. Category D, Educational Statistics, is classified and compiled by various departments of the Ministry of Education according to the educational matters under their jurisdiction. Some still need to wait for the reports from various provinces and cities before summarizing and totaling. Category E, Educational Miscellany, is compiled by the Compilation and Translation Bureau and experts from outside the Ministry separately. In order to speed up the completion of the yearbook, the Ministry of Education has already telegraphed various provinces and cities that have not submitted complete materials or have not submitted materials at all, limiting them to one month to send the materials. At the same time, it has stepped up its work. In addition to the division chief, secretary, advisor, section chief, and more than 30 staff members who were originally in charge of yearbook affairs, Li Gongming, Ding Yizhong, You Chunmao, Jin Fan, Li Guanglie, Li Jingyao, etc. have also been assigned to compile in order to supplement the compilation. The manuscripts undertaken by the Higher Education Department, the Department of Advisors, and the various compilation departments of the Compilation and Translation Bureau must be completed within two months. The remaining compilations will be edited based on the materials received.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Department of Education Orders the Promulgation of Methods for Exempting Outstanding Students from the Junior High School Graduation Examination</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education, in accordance with the orders of the Ministry, will hold the junior high school graduation examination in the spring of this year. All the details of the preliminary and supplementary examinations and the results of the preliminary examination have been detailed in this newspaper. Now it is learned that the Department of Education believes that students in various schools have different academic achievements. In addition to those who fail three or more subjects, who should be retained, those who fail one or two subjects should be given remedial classes if they still fail after the supplementary examination. Students with excellent grades should be appropriately encouraged. Moreover, the Department of Education held the junior high school graduation examination this time, and the content of the test questions included all the teaching materials of the three years. The results of the examination are more accurate, and the standards for admission to high school are seamless. Therefore, the Department of Education has specially ordered the promulgation of methods for exempting outstanding students from the junior high school graduation examination, and ordered all schools to comply. The methods are recorded below:</p>
<p>Provisional Measures for Exempting Outstanding Students from the Zhejiang Provincial Junior High School Graduation Examination</p>
<p>1.  The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education has formulated these measures to encourage outstanding students in the junior high school graduation examination to enter higher education. 2. Students who meet the following standards in the junior high school graduation examination may be exempted from the entrance examination: A. The average score of the graduation examination is above 75 points; B. The conduct and physical education reported by the original school are both above grade B. After the examination, the Department of Education will compile the names of the aforementioned students and send them to various senior high schools in the province or announce them by other methods. 3. The exemption from the entrance examination for the aforementioned students is limited to the following schools when enrolling first-year students: Provincial Senior High School, Affiliated Senior High School of Private Zhijiang College of Arts and Sciences, Provincial Fourth Middle School, Private Huilan Middle School, Provincial Seventh Middle School, Private Hongdao Girls' Middle School, Provincial Tenth Middle School, Private Xiuzhou Middle School, Provincial Girls' Middle School, Wuxing Affiliated Middle School of Private Soochow University, Provincial Senior Industrial Vocational School Run by Zhejiang University, Private Hugun Girls' Middle School, Provincial Senior Agricultural Vocational School Run by Zhejiang University, Private Xiaoshi Middle School, Provincial Senior Sericulture Vocational School, Private Siming Middle School, Provincial Mass Education Experiment School, Private Yongjiang Girls' Middle School, Provincial Hangzhou Normal School, Private Chunhui Middle School, Provincial Rural Normal School, Private Shaoxing Middle School, Yinxian County Girls' Middle School, Yinxian County Senior Industrial Vocational School. 4. The aforementioned schools accept exempted students with a quota of 10% of the new students enrolled. Those who wish to enroll more may do so. If the number of students willing to enter a school exceeds the school's quota, the order should be based on the ranking of the graduation examination. 5. Exempted students should select the school they wish to enter from the schools listed in Article 3, open their resumes, attach their graduation certificate or certificate, and their photo, and submit them to the original school for compilation and registration. 6. The original schools and the schools that accept exempted students should list the students who are recommended and accepted for exemption separately and submit them to the Department of Education for record. The form is determined separately. 7. Exempted students have the same admission procedures and post-admission treatment as other students. 8. After the implementation of these measures, the methods for provincial first middle school and provincial girls' middle school to recommend junior high school graduates to enter high school, which were approved by the Department of Education, will be abolished immediately. Students from these two schools who are exempted from the entrance examination are also subject to these measures. 9. These measures will be announced and implemented by the Department of Education.</p>
<h3>Director of the Anhui Department of Education Explains the Relocation and Merger of Four Vocational Schools and Two Rural Normal Schools</h3>
<p>Director Zhu of the Anhui Department of Education made the following remarks to reporters regarding the relocation and merger of the four vocational schools and two rural normal schools:</p>
<p>"I (Director Zhu referring to himself) have been in charge of Anhui Education for several months, and I have strived for improvement in everything I have observed. Since the joint suppression of bandits by the headquarters of the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui and the provincial government prepared to build cooperation and training orders, I have carefully studied the implementation of educational construction and made overall plans. This time, the proposal of this department was approved at the provincial government meeting to move the provincial second rural normal school, originally located in Bengbu, to Su County, the original site of the third vocational school, and merge the sericulture department of the fourth vocational school into the provincial second and fifth vocational schools. The school buildings left by the rural normal school will be temporarily taken over by the seventh vocational school in preparation for expanding the agricultural department in the 22nd year. This matter, on the one hand, is to seek close cooperation in educational construction, and on the other hand, to save waste and increase efficiency. The reasons are roughly the following ten points:</p>
<p>1. The provincial fourth vocational school was originally located in Su County and divided into agricultural and sericulture departments. It was found that the county is not a silkworm-producing area, and the school has no practice. The silkworm room and mulberry field are also rented. The rent fee is huge every year, and the number of students is not large. Transferring the second and third grade students of the sericulture department to Wuhu and Guichi vocational schools will not hinder their studies, and can enrich the content of the Wuhu and Guichi schools. Isn't it a win-win situation? The first-year students of the sericulture department are inserted into the second semester of the first grade of junior high school of the second rural normal school or other equivalent schools. The original agricultural students are temporarily handled by the second rural normal school, which is very appropriate.</p>
<p>2. Most of the students who graduated from the fourth vocational school over the years have served or studied in the field of primary school education, which is not in line with the original purpose of running a vocational school. Merging with the rural normal school is indeed in line with local needs.</p>
<p>3. Vocational education should be adapted to local conditions. The Bengbu area has always been known for producing soybeans and wheat. The Department of Education will set up a wheat improvement field and a silkworm pressing experiment field in Fengyang. Fengyang is only ten miles away from Bengbu. In the future, the seventh vocational school will add an agricultural department to the site of the second rural normal school, which will be very convenient for students to practice. 4. The student籍貫 of the second rural normal school belongs to 隣近 各縣. Those who are from 隣近 各縣 account for about eight out of ten. Bengbu and Su County are very close, and the transportation is convenient, so it will not hinder the enrollment of students from other places in the rural normal school.</p>
<p>5. The educational funds of this province are very tight. During this period of national crisis, it is especially appropriate to strictly practice austerity to save costs. The relocation and merger of various schools will not hinder the curriculum equipment, but can reduce the expenses of one school. Except for retaining the agricultural department for three grades, about 10,000 to 20,000 yuan can be saved annually, which can be used to add other educational undertakings or expand the collection of the seventh vocational school's agricultural department.</p>
<p>6. This is a question of gradually implementing the entire plan of striving for educational cooperation. As for how to develop production in northern Anhui and plan vocational schools, this department has detailed plans and implementation methods. The established policy is to develop the province's production and education, and there is no prejudice or favoritism, or even being constrained by local and regional ideas, and failing to seek overall improvement.</p>
<p>For these reasons, this department resolutely implemented the resolution of the provincial government meeting and immediately implemented it. People in northern Anhui understand the overall situation and will never have any misunderstandings."</p>
<h3>Zhejiang University Rehires Secretary-General</h3>

<h3>A New Translation of Government Accounting</h3>
<p>Professor Murray of the University of Illinois in the United States has written a book on government accounting, which elaborates on the theory and implementation of government accounting.

<h3>Lux Wins Youyou in Drizzling Rain</h3>
<p>Five to Zero, a Scene in Group A. Sun Jinshun Fights Alone. The Youyou Football Team played against Lux yesterday in a Group A match. Unfortunately, they lost five to zero. The score was two to zero in the first half. Although the situation seemed one-sided, Youyou worked hard to attack, and there were also times when Lux's goal was in turmoil. Unfortunately, the forwards were not quick enough and missed many opportunities, otherwise it might not have been the case. Center Sun Jinshun tried his best, but in the end, he couldn't break the enemy's goal, which made the hero feel that he had more than enough heart but not enough strength. The referee was Chen Jixiang. In the drizzling rain, there were more than five or six hundred spectators in Yiyuan, which was still lively. Youyou Team</p>
<p>Sun Huipei Wang Shusen Ye Jinmian Hu Youcheng Liang Guanlian Huang Ruihua Sun Jinshun Qian Yaobin Shi Jinsheng Xi Qiaosheng Wang Zhangbao Lux</p>
<p>Alger Balden Cochran Ke Qiolun Taiweite Fan Ens T Mada Luo Gen Beger Mashuer Blot Youyou Team Misses Good Opportunities Youyou's failure yesterday was fundamentally due to the slow movement. Sun Huipei's loss of a good opportunity is one example. In the second half, Wang Zhangbao, Xi Qiaosheng, etc. also missed the opportunity to score, which was all a pity. After ten minutes of the opening, Youyou also adopted an active offensive posture. Huang Ruihua sent a long pass to the center, Sun Jinshun passed the ball to the right, Hu Youcheng shot but missed. Lux pressed in, Xiao Liang got the ball, Mada arrived, Xiao Liang fell due to the slippery ground, and quickly threw the ball to the left, Alger kicked it out of bounds. Sun Jinshun dribbled straight, passed to Sun Huipei, went straight along the side, was less sensitive, Logan rushed over and the ball went out. Sun Huipei got the ball again, saw the enemy coming to block, passed it to Wang Zhangbao, kicked it slowly, and it was ineffective again. Huipei tried his best to pass the ball at his feet to the center, Sun Jinshun saw that the opportunity had come, Xi Qiaosheng sent it to Xi under no one's supervision, but Xi shot it over the wood, that is, Sun Huipei was also offside. Youyou's loss of opportunity can be seen in this way.</p>
<p>Lux Scores Two Goals in a Row. Once the opportunity is missed, disaster will come. At first, it was thought that this situation could be maintained in the first half, but at 25 minutes, Alger attacked along the side, Qian Yaobin's position was too forward, and it was too late to return. Mada then arrived, Wang Shusen's meal was not good, and he immediately went to block Mada's advance. At this critical moment, Xiao Liang missed the kick and did not hit it. Blot, the new right winger of Lux, kicked the ball into the net. After Youyou missed a goal, Ye Jinmian shot from 30 yards away from the goal, accurate and fast, but it was caught by Taiweite. Lux's counterattack was even more fierce, Alger shot fiercely, just hitting the wood on the goal, Fang Shenqing was fortunate, and Ke Moer scored again in Youyou's confusion, making the score two to zero in the first half.</p>
<p>Three More Goals Lost in the Second Half. At the beginning of the second half, Youyou once rushed fiercely, Hu Youcheng broke straight in, and forced a corner kick to no avail. Later, after Alger's shot was blocked by Liang, Sun Jinshun dribbled up, and Barton and three others watched closely. Sun slipped to the left corner of the door, stood up and passed to the center again, Sun Huipei did not pounce on it, and Lux's counterattack, then Kai Moer shot from 30 yards away from the door, fast and powerful, Xiao Liang had to succumb and fly in, making it three to zero. Youyou lost two more times in the last five minutes, Beger and Alger each scored a goal, and the game ended five to zero.</p>

The most evenly matched game was between Youth and Southern Star. The closest score was twenty-four to twenty-eight, only a two-point difference. Southern Star failed to handle this carefully and was broken through by Youth, who continuously increased their score. Although Southern Star tried their best to counterattack later, it was too late due to limited time, and they were defeated thirty-six to twenty-six. The games between Datong and Seven Teams, and Mai Ling and Xia Guang, had significant differences in strength and were less exciting. The Class A match results are compiled as follows:</p>

<h3>A Good Opportunity to Learn Swimming</h3>
<p>In recent years, people at sea have shown increasing interest in swimming, but few truly grasp the fun. The biggest reason is the time issue. According to swimming experts, the summer season is limited, and by the time one masters the skills, autumn and winter arrive. Therefore, to truly savor the essence, one must go through three stages: ㈠ Learn all the strokes during the cold season; ㈡ Put in considerable practice in the spring; ㈢ By summer, have the ability to control oneself in the water, floating and swimming at will, to possibly experience the wonderful realm. It is heard that the Chinese Swimming Research Association, for the sake of the happiness of the people of this port in the water, is building a heated swimming pool and has invited famous swimmers to be instructors, guaranteeing learning. Those who want to know the details of the association can directly inquire and register at the Chinese Business Company on the third floor of No. 9, Sanma Road. The brochure is sent by mail with two cents postage.</p>

<h3>Indians Worship Snakes</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>丨Three of Ballads of Worldly Customs丨</p>
<p>The Five Indias in the Ganges River Basin, fear the anger of snakes more than the anger of people. If snakes are angry, poisonous mist appears! Twenty thousand people die each year, and everyone fears snakes; from ancient times until now, countless have died because of snakes. 「Note 1」 They dare not catch snakes, but instead worship them with elaborate rituals! They recognize snakes as distant ancestors, calling them grandfathers; they fill the snakes' bellies with rice and moisten their teeth with milk and cheese; snakes possess great wisdom, and snakes can ward off all evils; who can compare with them? Surya in the Vedas! 「Note 2」 They are unparalleled in their nobility, who could be closer than snakes, who can truly portray the hundred ways they flatter snakes? Sing of it, praise Kipling! 「Note 3」 The meaning in the poem is thus: "Snakes are the necklaces of the gods, they bring forth real things to save the poor. Snakes have supreme power to overthrow the old and establish the new; they shed their skin only once a year, and can restore their youth. Snakes are the guardians of the treasures of the gods, rich in the wonders of the world, and can sometimes transform into all kinds of shapes to dazzle people." Those who flatter snakes are like those who flatter pets, kneeling before the gods to pray and beseech, snakes are ignorant but possess great titles, and are worthy to be paired with the sun god. 「Note 4」 Alas! The poison of the sun is more poisonous than the poison of snakes, the poisonous mist pervades the eastern continent! The world of poisonous snakes is like this, if it is not destroyed as a viper, disaster will be lurking! Disaster is lurking, it is a sorrowful cry! When snakes raise their heads, people crawl!</p>
<p>「Note 1」 On average, about 20,000 Indians die from snake plagues each year.</p>
<p>「Note 2」 Surya is the god of the sun.</p>
<p>「Note 3」 The British writer Kipling once chanted about the psychology of Indians worshiping snakes, namely the "..." above.</p>
<p>「Note 4」 There are often temples in the Indian forests that jointly worship the snake god and the sun god.</p>
<h3>Impressions of Island Life</h3>
<p>— Juan Yun</p>
<p>丨Whose World Is It丨</p>
<p>Qingdao is backed by mountains and surrounded by water. The beauty of its construction cannot but be attributed to the Germans. The Chinese buildings and new houses along the coast are extremely magnificent. The streets are exceptionally clean. The brutal Japanese took advantage of the situation to forcibly occupy and dominate; with great difficulty, we waved the banner of "Return Qingdao to Me" since we were elementary school students, and finally completed the handover procedure after expending immense effort. However, the various forces of Japanese commerce and finance remain strong. Along Guantao Road, Wusong Road, and Liaocheng Road, it is mostly a world of wooden sandals. The resident corps of the Japanese residents' group in Zhongshan Road often station marines; warships flying the Rising Sun flag come and go freely, as if Qingdao is still their dependency, acting recklessly and looking down on everyone!</p>
<p>The Qingdao Xinbao and Da Qingdao Bao are both Japanese mouthpieces, the only propaganda organs of the Japanese in Qingdao. Distorting right and wrong and confusing rumors are common tactics of the Japanese and are not surprising. The Japanese occupy seven or eight tenths of all businesses on the island. If you walk northeast from the coast, you can see Japanese colors everywhere, dazzling our eyes. During the nationwide boycott of enemy goods, Qingdao became a base for handling enemy goods. Countless traitors and unscrupulous merchants are truly heartbreaking to talk about!</p>
<p>Besides the Japanese, there are many White Russian refugees who have fled abroad. The wealthy ones open wine shops, dance halls, grocery stores, and bakeries; the poor ones are so impoverished that they beg in the streets.</p>
<p>The traitor Zheng Xiaoxu erected a stele with an inscription in a Japanese shrine, which proves that he has a long history with Japan. There are many spoils of the Sino-Japanese War in this shrine. Compatriots go to appreciate them without any sense of shame!</p>
<p>Indeed, Qingdao is a piece of fat spit out of the mouths of the Japanese, but it is still held by the Japanese in their mouths, with the possibility of being swallowed at any time!</p>
<h3>The Bee's Sting</h3>
<p>— Guo Changpu</p>
<p>When deeply in love, people always call their lovers "sweetheart"; but when love is lost, they call them "bitter heart" or "spicy heart," probably because the heart has changed.</p>
<p>I think men and women are always unequal. Why do women always ask men for alimony in divorces? Why is it always said that men rape women? Why...?</p>
<p>Meat-loving people! I invite you to visit the pork market, where you don't have to spend money.</p>
<p>Modern ladies are very willing to omit "Ms." and use "Mr." in their letters. I think they mean to have men change the title "Mr." to "Ms."</p>
<h3>"Cousin"</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ningyi</p>
<p>丨Cousin Is Three Thousand Miles Away丨</p>
<p>When Cangjie first created characters, he probably didn't expect that the character "cousin" would be so popular in the 20th century. I believe that when free love is prevalent, this character "cousin" is also in the limelight. If you don't believe me, listen to me tell you about it. A pair of lovers wanders in the park and lingers in the cinema. Accidentally, the man or woman runs into a familiar friend.</p>
<p>"Mr. Wang, long time no see. I guess this is your sweetheart?" the friend greets, winning quite a bit of praise for the West Lake of this district. According to the general public who have lived in Hangzhou for a long time, they honestly told me, "The scenic spots of the West Lake are reserved for outsiders to appreciate; we who grow up in Hangzhou really don't have time to appreciate them." This is indeed a sincere and truthful statement. For ordinary people, they are busy all day long making a living; so these mountains and lakes can naturally only be enjoyed by the leisure class. But paradise is still paradise! In the evening, you stroll along the West Lake, looking out at the setting sun, reflecting on the hills, the golden light dazzlingly displaying strange colors; the lake water ripples, like yellow scales; later, the sunset glow is patchy, with five colors mixed together. At that time, in the twilight, there are also a few small boats slowly coming, truly feeling that there is nothing outside of yourself, floating like an immortal, almost ready to ascend into the sky.</p>
<p>When the morning light is faint, you see the wonderful state of the West Lake making up in the morning, which also has an indescribable illusion. The newly rising lake and mountains are like a sleepy girl, giving you a lot of impressions, like your lover. When the morning sun rises in the east, the scene changes again. At that time, what appears before your eyes are the bright and continuous beautiful mountains, and the pink and white, high and low Chinese and Western houses: the graceful Baochu Pagoda seems to be laughing. It is currently being repaired there, but the majestic Leifeng Pagoda is not likely to be rebuilt.</p>
<p>Novel</p>
<h3>Photograph</h3>
<p>— Mo Yi</p>
<p>Zhang Rongji and his brother supported their seventy-three-year-old mother, and his wife held their son, not even caring about the dirty dishes on the table, as they were driven out by two enemies and a Chinese person.</p>
<p>When they walked out the door, all the people in the entire village, young and old, male and female, were like a flock of lambs going to the slaughterhouse, marching on the ice towards Pingdingshan under the escort of a large group of enemies.</p>
<p>When they arrived at Pingdingshan, they saw the people from Pingdingshan Village, already in groups of three or five, discussing this matter.</p>
<p>"How did the enemies suddenly become kind-hearted: they want to practice fighting, but they are not using us as targets!" "It's really strange!"</p>
<p>"I heard that they borrowed our place, and after a while, the Xuantong Emperor will also reward us with money, but isn't that a ghost story?"</p>
<p>"Look, another six or seven hundred people are coming..."</p>
<p>"Where are they from?"</p>
<p>"The people from Qianjinbao are also here!"</p>
<p>These later six or seven hundred people were the same as the people from Pingdingshan and Lizigou: the women held their children, and the men supported the seventy- or eighty-year-old grandmothers or grandfathers: behind them were enemies carrying guns.</p>
<p>"Brother Tong Er, I never thought we would meet here. Didn't you have someone bring me a message yesterday, saying you had something important to discuss with me? What exactly is it? ... Who are you carrying on your back? ... Aunt? Come down and sit for a while..." Zhang Rongji stepped forward, helped Tong Er's mother down from his back, and sat together on the ice.</p>
<p>The snow falling on their skin was like the burning-red pieces of iron from a shrapnel shell, and the wind drilling into their clothes was as painful as a bayonet stabbing into flesh. They all shrugged their shoulders, tightened their necks, crossed their hands in their sleeves, not caring whether the ground was wet, and sat cross-legged on the ice. Tong Er shook his head twice, shrank his neck, and was about to open his mouth to answer Zhang Rongji when suddenly a sharp whistle sounded, and the enemies gathered all the lambs they had escorted together. Then, with another command, the enemies dispersed in all directions, forming an encirclement; the three thousand or so men and women, old and young, from the three villages stood in the middle, looking confusedly at the enemies surrounding them. (5)</p>
<p>words would embarrass them both, so he came up with a desperate plan. "Don't talk nonsense, this is my cousin." Indeed, this word "cousin" is most suitable for relieving embarrassment. The so-called cousin is three thousand miles away, the children of the maternal uncle are cousins, the children of the paternal uncle are also cousins, and the children of the aunt are also cousins. If the word "cousin" is not added, if you don't have any sisters, people will definitely say, "I haven't heard you mention it before!"</p>
<p>There are also some adult gentlemen who have clouds of concubines. Of course, for some kind of need, they will go out to forage for food, perhaps to fall in love, but if they are accidentally encountered by the old tortoise (at least in the eyes of his concubines), then they also have to rely on this word "cousin"!</p>
<p>"Ah, sir, this is my cousin, who just came from somewhere." she would say very charmingly. But the former has a scandalous color and is afraid of being laughed at, so they use the word "cousin," while the latter feels that it is not proper, and even more dares not say that this is her lover. So, although the word "cousin" is very popular, the same word can be fortunate or unfortunate. When used by the latter, I think the word "cousin," if it had a spirit, would perhaps feel ashamed of itself, right?</p>
<h3>Poetic Hangzhou</h3>
<p>— Ke Ding'an</p>
<p>丨This Century's Paradise丨</p>
<p>The legend that "Paradise is in Suzhou and Hangzhou" convinces foreigners who come to China to agree, especially Hangzhou. Autumn Moon over the Peaceful Lake, Three Pools Mirroring the Moon... are good places to enjoy the moon. Although moon viewing is in the past, searching for plum blossoms in the snow on Gushan is precisely a refined pleasure for the future!</p>
<p>"Chengzhan" is Hangzhou's railway station, which has become increasingly dim since the rise of the new market; even the hotel business has almost moved to the west. However, in recent years, it has been striving for improvement, not inferior to the prosperity of the new market. Recently, with the completion of the Shanghai-Hangzhou highway, it has gained another layer of improvement. Parks are also being built in the vicinity to allow tourists to stop. In this way, the future of Hangzhou is truly limitless!</p>
<p>A Woman's Paradise</p>
<h3>Women and Home Economics</h3>
<p>— Juan Yun</p>
<p>The family is the foundation of society and the nation. As the saying goes, "Cultivate the family, govern the state, and pacify the world." If the family is not cultivated, the state will not be governed; if the state is not governed, the world will be in great chaos!</p>
<p>Therefore, women managing household affairs is not a lowly matter; being a mistress has never lowered a woman's status.</p>
<p>Modern women seem to have misunderstood. They think that women don't need to manage these trivial household chores and should stand up and be in society, the nation, and politics.</p>
<p>This is certainly true. Human beings should be equal, and women certainly have the qualifications to participate in politics.</p>
<p>But only with Mencius's mother could Mencius be created. Only with Yue Fei's mother could there be the loyal-hearted Yue Wu Mu. "Mother's education" is so important! How great!</p>
<p>If women are willing to abandon family life, then the future children will all be uneducated savages! Even if women themselves can work hard in social undertakings and political life, it is still "a loss outweighing the gain!"</p>
<p>Therefore, women should, in addition to managing household affairs, also be able to use their talents and thoughts to express powerful opinions and create great undertakings. There is no need to easily give up their position in the family.</p>
<p>I think a woman can smile in the afterlife because she often sees the four large characters "Virtuous Mother's Legacy" in front of the spirit tablet behind a woman!</p>
<h3>Women and Peace</h3>
<p>— Juan Yun</p>
<p>The blossoming branches are difficult to describe, just hanging down her hair. She lives near the green willow banks, across the red bridge; her eyebrows are delicate, her voice is like an oriole, she tries her jade flute. She loves to lightly break the "little cherries" with her scarlet lips. This is a small poem by Ms. Xue Qiong.</p>
<p>The lively innocence, joyful spirit, and gentle sentiments of women are all revealed in these words.</p>
<p>This is enough to return the glory of spring to the earth, it is the god of peace in the world! It should be respected more than anything, like the precious golden time of a girl! Men seem truly cruel and violent! The world has already created an irreparable situation. Amidst the sound of war drums, various tragic scenes of human killing are staged!</p>
<p>Human beings cannot be equal! Military force is cruel! Men seem to advocate using the law of the jungle as a common rule!</p>
<p>Looking at the peace of the world now, the League of Nations is only wearing a hypocritical mask! The original ferocious appearance can be seen from time to time in these traces that cannot be hidden; the result of brewing will inevitably lead to a second world war!</p>
<p>"War is dangerous!" This is universally recognized by everyone in the world. The poet Du Fu's "Ballad of the War Carts" and Li Hua's "Lament for the Ancient Battlefield" are already able to depict the pain of "war." There are a few lines in Du Fu's poem that write: "I know it is bad to give birth to a son; it is better to give birth to a daughter! Giving birth to a daughter can still be married to a neighbor, but giving birth to a son is buried in the weeds!" Although he was in an era where men were superior to women, he was able to write such sad and loving sentences for peace. Indeed, only women can maintain future world peace!</p>

<h3>A Bird's-Eye View of Shanghai's Medical and Pharmaceutical Scene in the Last Decade (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Pang Jingzhou</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Business Conditions</p>
<p>Hospitals are no longer a money-making endeavor. Moreover, public hospitals bear the responsibility of extensively benefiting the masses and serving the public, making it especially impossible not to operate at a loss. Therefore, the so-called "funds" are necessary, relying on the interest from the funds to provide financial support. Foreign-run hospitals mostly have established funds, but Chinese-run hospitals, as listed in the table above, simply have no funds at all. The best they can do is purchase their own land and build their own hospital buildings, relying on annual donations to cover ongoing expenses. The next best option is to rent hospital buildings, also relying on the board of directors to share the burden of annual donations. A few core members of the board, influential merchants, act as a backing, and in case the hospital lacks funds, these core members come forward to solicit donations from door to door, or dip into their own pockets to勉力maintain it. However, in major commercial ports, personnel changes are very rapid, and wealth and poverty are unpredictable. Influential merchants may not remain influential forever, and renowned figures who are good at socializing may also face times of financial hardship. Therefore, the rise and fall of hospitals depend on the personal profits and losses of the directors. As a result, old hospitals are busy seeking new directors and new strength, unable to make daily progress, and new hospitals dare not be established one after another. As far as I know, there are even hospitals renting buildings that cannot pay the rent, gradually collapsing due to being unsustainable. However, if people in society have a strong interest in hospitals, then in a major port like Shanghai, the economic power is ultimately not comparable to the inland areas. Every year, there are dozens of wealthy merchants who should have funds to run hospitals. However, firstly, society is full of old ideas, feeling that hospitals are a Western method, not in line with national habits, and unwilling to give money to the new medical community to develop their business. Secondly, in the past, Chinese capitalists, after contributing money, must manage affairs. If they believe they are laymen in medicine, they would rather use the money for other charitable causes, which is more clear-cut. So you issue your rice tickets, and I distribute my cotton clothing, each doing their own small-scale charity, resulting in neither concentrated funding nor charitable undertakings going towards a passive direction. If we say that the responsibility of running hospitals is pushed onto our medical community, we really do not have this power. And to blame the new medical community for not running good public hospitals, is as absurd as blaming coffin shops for not giving away coffins. Waiting for merchants with new ideas to get rich, the opportunity is even less. Thus, the possibility of establishing hospitals is especially small.</p>
<p>However, arousing the interest of capitalists cannot be achieved overnight. Only after a kind of old force in society fails will they be willing to realize it. Or, after the efforts of the new medical community, they obtain the benefits of new medicine, then they will also have interest. But according to the current situation, it is difficult to achieve results. Why? Because even when capitalists themselves need to stay in a hospital, they can pay a very high price to stay in hospitals run by foreigners. On the one hand, they criticize Chinese-run hospitals as corrupt and lacking order. In reality, the reason why hospitals are not run well is one-third due to talent, while two-thirds are still due to economic and social support. Another point is that I feel that officials in our government may not have much interest in hospitals either. Just look, whenever important figures claim illness for leave or retire to recuperate, they all stay in foreign hospitals, and mostly in foreign private sanatoriums. 推想Their mentality is that they long considered hospitals as 洋貨, which is the big dish eaten by high-class people and not necessarily needed by the common folks. Regarding the capitalists unwilling to invest because of being laymen, I have an example here for the reference of people in society:</p>
<p>There is a Peking Union Medical College Hospital in Beijing, which everyone knows is run by the Rockefeller Foundation. However, Rockefeller himself never asks about the internal administration of the hospital, and the Rockefeller Foundation Committee hands it over to a medical committee to manage. For example, if the Peking Union Medical College Hospital is in China, it is handed over to the "China Medical Committee" to manage. The committee members are all famous medical experts in China, selected through precise considerations. Experts are fully responsible and have full authority, so the hospital is well-organized. On the one hand, in order to maintain the ownership of the funders, the entire property of the hospital is rented to this group at the lowest price. Millions of yuan of property is rented for only one US dollar per year. There is a contract, and a time limit is set. This small rent, although equivalent to zero, maintains the legal status. If the funders believe that this group is managing poorly, they can declare that the contract is terminated upon expiration and hand it over to another group to manage. In this way, there will be no one who is not enthusiastic and seeking improvement.</p>
<h3>On the Effects of Drugs (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Yu Gong</p>
<p>Before science was developed, human life was mysterious and unpredictable. People did not know why they were sick or why they died. When they could not understand it after much thought, they had no choice but to seek gods and worship Buddha, thinking to ward off misfortune. When warding off misfortune failed, they begged for help from all kinds of inconceivable waste products, such as dead people's pillows and mats, ropes from suicides, children's urine, patients' clothes, women's menstruation, and women's pubic hair. None of these were excluded from being used as medicine. Taking dead people's pillows and mats as an example, Chen Zangqi of the past said, "An old woman suffered from cold stagnation for a long time and did not recover for years. Song Xu Sibai said, "This is corpse consumption. You should cook a dead person's pillow and take it." So he went to an ancient tomb and took a dead person's pillow. The pillow had already been damaged and missing a corner. The old woman took it and recovered." This is one example. Taking suicide ropes as an example, Li Shizhen said, "There was a wealthy family's son who went to a brothel. He was startled and fell on the corpse of an executed person. He was greatly frightened and went mad. The doctor Pang Anchang took the rope from the hanged prisoner, burned it to ashes, mixed it with medicine, and gave it to him. He recovered." This is another example. Taking patients' clothes as an example, Li Shizhen said, "During an epidemic, take the clothes of a newly sick person and steam them in a steamer, and the whole family will not get sick." This is another example. Taking human urine as an example, doctors call it "Wheel of Fortune Wine" and "Return to Origin Soup." Zhu Zhenheng said, "Urine can lower fire and raise turbidity. It is common to see old women who are over eighty years old looking like they are in their forties. When asked why, they often have malignant diseases. Someone advised them to take urine for more than forty years, and they were able to return to youth." This is another example. Taking women's menstruation as an example, the "Records of Diverse Matters" says, "The Yi people in Jiaozhou use scorched copper as poison and apply it to sharp edges. If it hits a person, it will corrode them, and the bones will break in an instant. But taking women's menstruation and urine juice can解毒." This is another example. Taking women's pubic hair as an example, the "Comprehensive Records for Holy Relief" says, "After being sick, having intercourse causes the eggs to swell or shrink into the abdomen, causing twisting pain that makes one want to die. Take women's pubic hair, burn it to ashes, drink it, and also drink the water used to wash the陰部, and one will recover." This is another example. The prescriptions recorded in the medical books are far-fetched and fabricated, considering something as a panacea or an immortal herb, such as Yu Wang's leftover grains, which grow in Kuaiji Mountain. In the past, Yu Wang abandoned his leftover food in the river here. Later people took it as medicine, so it was named Yu Yu Liang. Also, in the past, Du Zhong gained enlightenment by taking a certain medicine, so it was named after him. Also, the original meaning of Liu Ji Nu grass. In the past, Emperor Gaozu of Song, Liu Yu, whose nickname was Ji Nu, encountered a large snake and shot it when he was young. The next day, he went to hear the sound of a pestle and mortar. Following it, he saw several boys, all dressed in blue, pounding medicine in the forest. When asked why, they replied, "Our master was shot by Liu Ji Nu, and now we are compounding medicine to apply to him." Yu said, "Why doesn't your master kill him?" They said, "Ji Nu is a king, and he cannot be killed." Yu reprimanded them, and the boys all scattered. Then he took the medicine and returned. Whenever he suffered from 金瘡, applying it would immediately heal him. This is another example.</p>

<h3>The Problem of Lung Disease in China (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Ding Huikang</p>
<p>Pulmonary Tuberculosis and Surgical Procedures</p>
<p>The difficulty in treating pulmonary tuberculosis is universally known. If patients only take medicine and injections or go to other places for recuperation, although temporary results can be achieved, the number of those who relapse later accounts for the majority. Although modern medicine is advancing day by day, there is still no specific medicine for pulmonary tuberculosis. Therefore, modern pulmonary medicine has deviated from the scope of internal medicine and switched to surgical procedures to directly compress the lesions, so that they can rest as much as possible, with the main purpose of improving the patient's resistance. In lung disease sanatoriums in Europe and the United States, for lung disease patients, if surgery can be performed in time, the results are very satisfactory and reliable. Unfortunately, most hospitals in our country lack various equipment and specialized personnel, and patients often turn pale at the mention of surgery and cannot have a proper understanding. Sitting and waiting for pulmonary tuberculosis to run rampant is regrettable. The various surgical procedures commonly performed in the world recently are briefly described below.</p>
<p>Artificial Pneumothorax: We humans have two lungs, left and right, located in the chest cavity. The inner wall of the chest cavity has a thin membrane, which is connected to a thin membrane surrounding the outside of the lung. The space between these two layers of membrane is called the pleural cavity. It does not contain gas, so the human lungs can freely expand during breathing. Because the pleural cavity does not contain gas, the lungs have no external pressure.</p>
<p>If a lung is diseased, we should let it rest completely, then we can achieve twice the result with half the effort. The healthy lung should also work as usual at the same time. This ideal has now become a reality, which is artificial pneumothorax.</p>
<p>Artificial pneumothorax is to send a gas into the chest wall cavity and the pleural cavity outside the lung, so that the lung is compressed and can get an adequate rest.</p>
<p>We all know that the progress of tuberculosis is mainly caused by the movement of the diseased lung. If the diseased lung is compressed directly by surgery, the circulation of blood and lymph fluid will be slowed down, preventing the distribution of tuberculosis bacteria. At the same time, it promotes the proliferation of connective tissue in the lungs and separates it from the healthy parts. Thus, pathological phenomena gradually disappear, and the diseased lung can rest completely. In this way, the progress of the disease can be avoided, and the purpose of treatment can be achieved.</p>
<p>The practical significance of artificial pneumothorax is not only to make the diseased lung shrink and remain static, but also to promote the trend of treatment and extend the patient's life. At the same time, it can also prevent the infection of the healthy lung on the other side and its family members. Therefore, in the treatment and prevention of tuberculosis, artificial pneumothorax occupies the highest authority and cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Clinical observation: After performing artificial pneumothorax, what is the clinical observation? Based on the results of my years of practice, it is very satisfactory. If the fever is above 38 degrees Celsius, there are small bubble sounds in the lungs, night sweats, coughing, sputum, etc., after surgery, the body temperature can mostly return to normal in about ten days, and the toxic symptoms disappear. After two and a half months, no tuberculosis bacteria can be seen in the sputum. This good result cannot be achieved by quiet treatment or various injection treatments. The credit must be attributed to artificial pneumothorax.</p>
<h3>Talking About Phlegm 2</h3>
<p>— Yu Yunxiu</p>
<p>Zou Runan, in his Annotation and Commentary on the Herbal Classic, said about phlegm and fluid retention, "The Inner Canon never mentions phlegm and fluid retention. The Synopsis of the Golden Chamber discusses it in detail. However, it mentions fluid retention more and phlegm less. The Thousand Gold Remedies and the Outer Terrace Secret Prescriptions already mention phlegm and fluid retention equally. Down to later generations, the mention of fluid retention becomes less and less, while the mention of phlegm becomes more and more." This statement is correct. He also said, "This is the time of the rise and fall of the world." Then it is not right. The meanings of the word "phlegm" are interpreted differently in ancient and modern times. Therefore, the diseases discussed are different in reality even if the names are the same. It is not that phlegm as a disease was less in ancient times and more now. The phlegm and fluid retention mentioned in the Synopsis of the Golden Chamber are fluids in the stomach and intestines. The pulse conditions recorded in the Pulse Classic are the same as in the Synopsis of the Golden Chamber. However, the Synopsis of the Golden Chamber and the Pulse Classic never mention phlegm alone. It only appears once in the "Latent Retention" section. They also never differentiate between phlegm and fluid retention and treat them as opposites. But in Chao Yuanfang's General Treatise on the Causes and Symptoms of Diseases, it says, "Phlegm and fluid retention are caused by the obstruction of qi and meridians, the failure of fluids to circulate, and the stagnation of water and fluids in the chest and abdomen, congealing into phlegm." This is the first time that phlegm is mentioned independently. It also says, "A biased wiry pulse is phlegm. A floating and slippery pulse is fluid retention." This is the first time that phlegm and fluid retention are treated as opposites. The Synopsis of the Golden Chamber considers a biased wiry pulse as fluid retention, and says, "Lung retention is not wiry, but causes shortness of breath." Chao's treatise changes the biased wiry pulse and attributes it to phlegm, and creates a floating slippery pulse and attributes it to fluid retention. It can be said that he has completely changed Zhongjing's old theory. Looking at his discussion of the symptoms of phlegm, he says, "Phlegm and water congeal." Discussing fluid retention, he says, "Water and qi stagnate." "Congealing" means changing its old form, just as dew congeals into frost. "Stagnating" means remaining in its original state, just as a river stagnates and becomes a pool. Therefore, Chao's so-called phlegm is no longer the old form of fluid retention, but a transformed appearance of fluid retention. Later generations consider粘稠mucus and thick turbid sputum as phlegm. This is actually a seed sown here. However, his saying that it is formed by the congealing of water and fluid retention still recognizes that the achievement of phlegm comes from fluid retention. This has not completely escaped the theory of the Synopsis of the Golden Chamber. From this point of view, Chao's so-called phlegm is a link connecting Zhongjing's theory above and opening the door to later generations below. It is truly a transitional key to the ancient and modern changes in the theory of phlegm. The discussion of phlegm in the Thousand Gold Remedies and the Outer Terrace Secret Prescriptions is also a product of the transitional era. After all, the Sui and Tang dynasties are adjacent in time, and the theories of medical experts have not changed much. The Thousand Gold Inula Flower Decoction treats phlegm nodules in the chest, where sputum is like glue. This is what people today call viscous phlegm. The so-called lingering phlegm and hidden fluid retention are mostly stomach diseases. The vomiting of沫in the Ginger and Aconite Decoction is the mucus in the stomach. It is the so-called stomach phlegm of later generations. It is actually a symptom of gastritis. The "Teasing the Diaphragm Powder's"飲is cold. The cold phlegm of the Ginger and Aconite Decoction and the cold in the chest and burning sensation in the heart of the Evodia Decoction are the same diseases as swallowing acid and spitting water. They are symptoms of excessive stomach acid. The spitting of water in the Thousand Gold Wings Red Stone Fat Powder is also this disease and has nothing to do with what is called phlegm today. However, the General Treatise on the Causes and Symptoms of Diseases, the Thousand Gold Remedies, the Thousand Gold Wing Remedies, and the Outer Terrace Secret Prescriptions have already recognized viscous saliva as phlegm. However, the symptoms of various phlegm and fluid retention diseases described by them rarely mention coughing, except for quoting old texts from the Synopsis of the Golden Chamber (such as coughs with supporting retention and hanging retention). From this, it is known that their so-called viscous phlegm is all stomach mucus, and all are symptoms of acute or chronic gastritis. They are not the phlegm that today's people call phlegm that comes out of coughing. With what we know today, inferring the disease symptoms described by the ancients is often not entirely accurate, because the ancients' observations were not very precise and the records were not very detailed. However, the rough symptoms are still credible. For example, the Synopsis of the Golden Chamber describes phlegm and fluid retention, saying that the patient was originally strong but is now thin, water moves between the intestines, and there is a gurgling sound. It is known that the digestive and absorption function of the intestines is severely impaired. Nutrition is poor. There is also gas generated in the intestines, and the contents of the intestines are originally liquid. Gas and water flow together, so there is a gurgling sound. This must be due to a narrow place in the stomach and intestines, or a dilated place. Otherwise, it is caused by diseases such as indigestion, sluggish movement, or fermentation and decay. The symptoms of supporting retention include cough, leaning breath, shortness of breath, and inability to lie down. Its shape is like swelling. There are also symptoms of fullness of breath, firmness in the lower part of the heart, dizziness, and no thirst. This is what is called "water in the heart," firmness in the lower part of the heart, shortness of breath, aversion to water, and unwillingness to drink. This must be a heart disease. If there is left-sided wet pleurisy with a lot of fluid accumulation, pressing on the lungs and heart, it can also cause firmness in the lower part of the heart and shortness of breath. However, pleurisy should have pain and heat. The cough and pain in hanging retention and the fullness of breath and vomiting in latent retention, with chills and fever and back and腰疼upon onset, are slightly similar to it. However, supporting retention does not mention pain and does not mention heat. It does not seem like pleurisy. The Inula Flower Pill in the Thousand Gold Remedies, its indications are completely diseases of gastric dilatation and gastric垂, and there is no so-called stagnation. In short, in the Sui and Tang dynasties, viscous saliva was recognized as phlegm. Only supporting retention was a heart disease. The rest were stomach and intestinal diseases. There were no such absurdities as after the Jin and Yuan dynasties. Moreover, the origin of phlegm was considered to be the congealing of water and fluid retention, which was not very different from the Synopsis of the Golden Chamber. There were no such complexities as after the Jin and Yuan dynasties.</p>
<h3>The Use of Chinese Medicine in the Western Style (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Mengbai</p>
<p>㈤ Male Fern (Dryopteris) adpidium,</p>
<p>Original Source</p>
<p>This product is the rhizome and leaf base residue of the fern (polypodiaceal) plant DiyptorisFilix-masSchott. It is collected in autumn. The clustered roots, scales, and decayed parts are removed and dried.</p>
<p>Shape</p>
<p>The rhizome of this product is cylindrical, and some are curved. It often has longitudinal cracks or coarse leaf base residue marks, and a few coarse longitudinal ridges and grooves. The surface is dark brown, and the inside is light brown. It has six to twelve vascular bundles, which form a discontinuous circle and are arranged in a circle. It has a slight odor. The taste is initially sweet and astringent, then bitter and spicy.</p>
<p>Ingredient</p>
<p>The effective ingredients of this product are very complex. The opinions of scholars are not yet consistent. According to Boehm, it is called Filixic acid (Fulixsame) and has the composition (C35H38Oi12). It is a light yellow, fine cup-shaped crystal. According to Knafi, it is called Filmaron (with the composition C47H52O16), which is a non-crystalline yellow powder. It also contains volatile oil, fat, oil, Filixic Tannic Acid, etc. The volatile oil has the unique pungent aroma of Filix.</p>
<p>Experiment</p>
<p>If the outer skin of this product is peeled off and it has turned brown, it is an old product. The force is reduced. Fresh ones must be used for medicinal purposes. The cross-section should be green. The root powder of this product should not appear yellowish-green. The weight of the ash content of this product should not exceed three percent.</p>
<p>Efficacy</p>
<p>This product is a drug to expel tapeworms and broad tapeworms. The effect is extremely good. However, it is not as good as pomegranate peel for pork tapeworms. It is also used for duodenal worms. Children use four to five grams. Adults use 20 to 25 grams.</p>
<p>Storage method</p>
<p>This product is prone to decomposition. It should be protected from light and sealed tightly. Pay attention to storing it in a container dried on quicklime. Those whose outer skin has been peeled off and whose cross-section is brown should not be stored. According to the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, Dryopteris is attached under the name Guan Zhong, meaning that Dryopteris and Guan Zhong are different names for the same thing. However, the original plant of Guan Zhong is AspidiumFalcatumS.W. Although the first word is the same as the Dryopteris name, the original plant is different from Dryopteris. Dryopteris is a deworming medicine, while Guan Zhong is a hemostatic and detoxifying medicine. The effects are also different. It seems that they are plants of the same type and family but not the same species. It is specially recorded here for confirmation.</p>
<h3>Scientific Essays on Achieving Life (5)</h3>
<p>— Yu Songjun</p>
<p>(7) Accurate Diagnosis of Pregnancy (B) Misidentification of Pregnancy and Disease</p>
<p>Incompetent doctors often mistakenly indicate that pregnancy is a disease, or mistakenly say there is pregnancy when there is none. Therefore, cases of harming people's lives often occur in society. Now I will write this situation below so that the public can pay attention:</p>
<p>(I) Saying that pregnancy is a disease ... Among many women, if menstruation has stopped for three months, the body gradually becomes weak, appetite is poor, sleep is restless, the spirit is sluggish, and the mood is volatile, but there are no manifestations of vomiting and nausea. Even she herself is very doubtful. If she consults an incompetent obstetrician, most of them will either say it is dry blood consumption or say it is menstrual obstruction. They casually prescribe a prescription to regulate the menses. It really works. In less than two days, bright red menstruation really comes down, but it is not very smooth. She goes back for a follow-up consultation. So the medicine is increased and blood clots continue to come down, but after this situation, the woman suddenly becomes pale, has虛汗and虛脱and is unconscious. This degree of danger is a disguised abortion. Isn't it terrible?</p>
<p>(II) Mistakenly saying there is pregnancy when there is none ... If a woman in her thirties has never given birth for several years or more than ten years, or if she has given birth but the child died, menstruation suddenly stops at this time, and she also feels疑慮. If she consults an incompetent doctor, they often say that she is pregnant. If her menstruation comes again two months later, and menstruation occurs every month thereafter, but it is very thin, she still goes to the doctor, and they often say that she has a "rat fetus." So, she takes 安胎medicine and Twelve Great Protectors' pregnancy powder, etc., month after month, until thirteen months or twenty months, and there is still no sign of childbirth. It turns out that although the woman's abdomen is slightly enlarged, the uterus is normal, it has not enlarged, and there are no other symptoms of pregnancy mentioned above. This is also a joke of misdiagnosis.</p>
<p>(8) Obstetrical Examination Methods</p>
<p>Obstetrical examinations must be very detailed. Generally, they do not go beyond the following methods:</p>
<p>(A) Questioning</p>
<p>In a patient's medical history and condition, it is extremely important for the examination. The following questions should not be ignored:</p>
<p>(I) What is the person's surname, place of origin, age, and occupation (or the husband's occupation)?</p>
<p>(II) What diseases do parents, brothers, and sisters have (especially tuberculosis, mental illness, cancer, etc.)?</p>
<p>(III) What illnesses did the person have in childhood? What is noted in obstetrics is bone disease and joint disease, especially rickets (i.e. rickets).</p>
<p>(IV) Past health status, pay attention to diseases after menstruation? Also, arthritis, heart disease, infectious diseases, etc., are particularly important.</p>
<p>(V) The month and year of the first menstruation, and its course, order, amount, and duration? What obstacles are there to normal menstruation?</p>
<p>(VI) If she is multiparous, what was the course of past pregnancies, childbirths, and puerperium?</p>
<p>(1) Pregnancy: Whether she was full-term? Whether there were miscarriages, premature births, and morning sickness?</p>
<p>(2) Childbirth: Whether it was a difficult birth? How fast or slow? Was there any bleeding? Has surgery been used?</p>
<p>(3) Puerperium: Was there a fever? The life or death of the infant?</p>
<p>(VII) The situation in this pregnancy: 1. The date of the last menstruation? 2. The time of conception? 3. Subjective symptoms after amenorrhea? 4. Are there any symptoms of nausea and vomiting? 5. The date of subjective fetal movement?</p>
<p>(B) Current symptoms</p>
<p>Before the examination, a whole-body examination must be performed first, and attention should be paid to the following points:</p>
<p>(I) The size of the body: physique, bones, and nutritional status?</p>
<p>(II) Diseases of the lungs and heart?</p>
<p>(III) Is there swelling in the lower limbs? Are there varicose veins?</p>
<p>(IV) Is there spinal curvature or curvature of other bones?</p>
<p>(V) Is there protein or sugar in the urine?</p>
<p>(VI) Nervous system?</p>
<p>(VII) Examination of the breasts and abdomen.</p>
<p>(C) Palpation</p>
<p>Palpation is a diagnosis made by the sense of touch of the fingers. It is also a necessary condition for examination:</p>
<p>(I) The degree of abdominal distension and its thickness?</p>
<p>(II) The shape and size of the uterus, the degree of tension, the thickness of the uterine wall, and the height of the uterine fundus?</p>
<p>(III) The position of the various parts of the fetus (such as the head, buttocks, back, etc.)?</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Talks on Lung Disease</h3>
<p>— Hou Guangdi</p>
<p>A philosopher once said, "People must insult themselves, then others will insult them. Things must rot from within, then insects will breed in them." This is especially true when talking about diseases. Tuberculosis has long been a major enemy of humankind. Wherever humans go, the disease spreads. Its mortality rate is one in seven. For example, out of 400 trillion people, 60 trillion will die from this disease. The number is alarming. No wonder advanced countries are doing their best in sanitation, as if a great enemy is about to invade, and they must stand ready. However, tuberculosis bacteria are everywhere. Objects, dust, food, sputum, feces—everywhere bacteria can attach. Humans interact with each other, humans interact with objects, and there is danger of infection everywhere. To avoid it, to eradicate it, is actually very difficult. Even with disinfection and cleanliness everywhere, a thousand plans will inevitably have a flaw, and perhaps no one will be spared. Yet, under certain circumstances, one is often afflicted while another is not, one is infected while another is spared. This is nothing more than individual resistance. A strong constitution means sufficient resistance. The bacteria cannot enter, it is not self-inflicted or self-decayed, and external objects cannot invade. This is one aspect. As for those who already have tuberculosis, they account for almost half of the world's population. Among this half, some show no signs of tuberculosis in peacetime, but after death, examination of the lungs reveals tubercles. However, they only suffered from it once and then recovered, and the cause of death was not this disease. Some have tuberculosis for a long time but can still maintain their health and enjoy longevity. Some have weak bodies and rely on recuperation to prolong their lives. Generally speaking, tuberculosis is not incurable. It all depends on how it is treated and the strength of resistance, which determines its fate. Therefore, therapists often say that tuberculosis can be cured. Given the immaturity of hygiene and the low living standards in our country, eight or nine out of ten people suffer from tuberculosis, or other diseases such as scrofula, laryngeal tuberculosis (laryngitis), arthritis (gonitis), bronchitis, and bronchiectasis. These are all too common. Although not all are tuberculosis, they are all tuberculous. Yet, we do not see death filling the roads or a sharp decline in population, indicating that natural recovery is common. From this, we can believe that tuberculosis bacteria cannot kill people. Those who are killed are given an opportunity to be exploited. This aligns with the principle of self-decay and insects. This is another aspect. Now, let's discuss treatment methods. Judging from the previous discussion, the relationship between tuberculosis and individual resistance is very clear. Therefore, the treatment plan is based on this. First, build a healthy constitution. Second, enrich the plasma of blood cells and increase the production of blood cells. Air, sunlight, and nutrients have long been essential for sanatoriums. Everyone knows this. But there is a misunderstanding that needs to be corrected. People with tuberculosis often regard cod liver oil as the only nutrient, or eat raw beef and raw beef juice, chicken eggs, chicken juice, etc. However, eating a lot and nourishing are two different things. Eating and digesting is nourishing. Eating without digesting becomes harmful. Therefore, taking cod liver oil is suitable during the chronic phase, during fiber changes, or in the early stages of lung disease. But if taken when lung tissue is deteriorating, it can cause digestive disorders and damage appetite, doing no small harm. Applying cod liver oil to the skin can also be absorbed through the skin, which is an alternative to internal use. The frequency should be determined based on the patient's condition. For example, extremely weak patients should have it rubbed on their skin every other day.</p>
<h3>Idle Chat After Diagnosis (Four)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Senyu</p>
<p>E. Canned Foods and Spoiled Foods: Foods stored for a long time are often spoiled, vitamins are lost, and they contain toxins. The same is true for spoiled foods. Because they are harmful and not beneficial, they should be avoided.</p>
<p>F. Smoked and Spiced Foods: They have an appetizing effect in the short term, but prolonged use can damage the stomach. Some spices can also be toxic.</p>
<p>G. Meat Consumption Should Be Reduced to a Minimum: A small amount is enough to supplement daily nutrition. Consuming large amounts cannot be utilized, causing the body to become heavy and obese. Our bodies should not be large, but tough, strong, happy to work, energetic, and resistant. This is what constitutes good health.</p>
<p>The above is a simplified account, written hastily during breaks from diagnosis and published. Readers are asked to forgive any omissions. (End)</p>

<h3>Dumping Tax and National Goods Year</h3>
<p>— He Bing</p>
<p>China has long been the end point for international capitalist sales. Due to mutual competition and attempts to monopolize trade with China, countries often resort to "dumping." Before the war, British and Japanese cotton textiles competed in the Chinese market, and after the war, Japanese cotton textiles monopolized it. Britain did not rely on dumping as its main policy. Since the high development of capitalism and the resulting global economic panic, countries have been striving for a balance of payments. The dumping of surplus goods in China has become increasingly fierce.</p>
<p>Dumping, also called "tun bing," is a translation of the English word "dumping." The meaning is simple: generally, producers in one market sell their surplus products at irrationally low prices in another market. That market is called the "dumping ground." In other words, "dumping" means that producers in a certain country sell their goods cheaply in foreign countries. The price is either lower than the price in the domestic market or even below cost, with the aim of suppressing other goods and seizing the market. The country exporting these goods is the "dumper," and the country importing these goods is the "dumped." From the perspective of the exporting country, selling the same goods at different prices in different markets is dumping. Therefore, dumping takes four forms: (1) the selling price is lower than the price of the same goods in the foreign market; (2) the selling price is so low in the foreign market that competitors cannot compete with it; (3) the selling price in the foreign market is lower than the price of the same goods in the domestic market; (4) the selling price is below cost, and the producer does not make a profit. Most of the goods traded with China by various countries, except for those that are monopolized, are sold through dumping, especially Japanese goods. Japanese cotton textiles, coal, fish, seafood, fruits, and other goods sold in China are all used to exclude other goods through dumping. Recently, for example, the prices of Japanese coal from Fushun, Gensan, Kanda, and Ikeno have fallen again and again. The original dumping price of Fushun coal was 4.60 Japanese yen, but recently it has fallen to 2.85 yen. There are many other similar examples. On the surface, falling prices are beneficial to consumers, which is good for the importing country. But this is a big mistake.</p>
<p>The way to strengthen a country lies in the development of its national economy. To achieve this goal, a balance of international payments is a prerequisite. But without developing domestic industry and commerce, how can this be achieved? Foreign dumping policies are a major blow to the development of domestic industry and commerce. China's industry is still emerging. The cost of raw materials, manufacturing, and other aspects is higher than that of advanced capitalist countries, making it difficult to compete with them. If there is dumping of similar goods, it will be difficult to survive. The failure of our country's national paper industry, match industry, seafood industry, and textile industry to develop is due to the impact of dumping by capitalist countries. During the European War, capitalist countries had no time to look east, and textile factories in Tianjin and Shanghai sprung up like bamboo shoots after rain. But when the European War ended, they collapsed one after another and have been in decline ever since. This is clear evidence. Countries with absolute tariff autonomy can build high tariff barriers to limit the dumping of foreign goods. In addition, they also implement anti-dumping laws as needed. Although our country's tariffs are autonomous, they are not absolute, and restrictions on the dumping of foreign goods are particularly urgent. The implementation of anti-dumping laws is therefore a matter of urgency.</p>
<p>Moreover, this year is the National Goods Year, and the promotion and advancement of national goods relies heavily on the implementation of dumping taxes. Japanese goods are the most dumped goods in China. The implementation of dumping taxes is an aid to resisting Japanese goods. In addition, Russia is also known for its dumping policies. After the resumption of Sino-Russian diplomatic relations, our country also relies on the implementation of dumping taxes to prevent unfavorable trade with Russia.</p>
<h3>The Four Blocs Under the Group Economic System</h3>
<p>— Yang Keju</p>
<p>With the progress of human social organization, the scope of economic life has gradually expanded. Due to different environments and the needs of the times, there are various economic scopes to adapt to them. Even the world economy, countries did not try their best to promote its realization in the past, but in recent years countries have no longer tended towards the development of international economics. The reasons can be summarized in two points: (1) The most important point of the world or international economy lies in the free flow of goods between countries. Although countries nominally have free trade and are unhindered, in reality they have extremely high tariff barriers, restricting the import of goods from other countries, so that domestic goods are not affected by foreign goods in the country. Countries are based on their own interests, so they are unwilling to sacrifice their own interests and reduce tariffs. Therefore, there is the saying of rationalizing production, in order to reduce the cost of products. However, with the widespread adoption of production rationalization by various countries, the reduction of costs is not enough to mention competition. (2) The key to international economics is the free flow of capital and gold and silver. In the past three years, countries have successively banned the export of gold. From 1930 to 1932, countries advocated exchange control to control the flow of capital. Even more severe was the prohibition of exchange. Even recently, trade management has been adopted. This method hinders the progress of international economics and digs its own grave. What has risen in its place is the group economy. The term group economy (BlocsEconmy) has been seen in the world for a very short time. The so-called group is centered on a strong country. This strong country either unites neighboring small countries or binds its colonies or quasi-colonies into a large group. Within the group, the highly industrialized strong countries have the convenience of obtaining raw materials and the absolute freedom of marketing goods. Of course, tariff barriers are eliminated, and goods are exchanged with extremely beneficial conditions. The meaning and purpose of the group economy are achieved. Therefore, the implementation of all economic activities within a strong economy group (EconomyBloc) can be free and unhindered, and command is free. Since this is the case, what is the use of international economics? Highly industrialized countries are now going down this path.</p>
<p>There are now four countries at the center of the world's economic groups, which can also be said to be the world's four major economic groups. Let us briefly summarize each group.</p>
<p>(1) The economic group centered on the United States of America. The development of American capitalism began in the era of the North and South American Wars. Her group is formed by Hawaii, the Philippines, Panama, and the recovered Cuba, Haiti, Santo Domingo, Nicaragua, and other countries. The expansion of her power first exports commerce and then exports capital. The export of goods increased from 3,971 million gold yuan in 1922 to 5,321 million gold yuan in 1928. In terms of capital, it increased from 802.1 million yuan in 1922 to 15,170 million yuan in 1932. Her power is not only expanding within the group, but also trying to pull Britain's Canada into the group. This can be understood by looking at the fact that the rate of increase in British goods and investment is not as fast as the rate of increase in Britain. At the same time, there is a very rapid increase in trade and investment in Europe, and there are also huge war debts. Therefore, the expansion of the current American group is truly alarming. The most deeply affected are Britain and France, which have conflicts with the British group in Canada and conflicts with the French group in Europe.</p>
<p>(2) The economic group centered on England. This group is formed by the UK itself, the Irish Free State, Canada, Newfoundland, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa and other autonomous territories, as well as India, Ceylon, the Malay Islands, Gibraltar, Malta, Portugal, and other British colonies and dependencies. However, what Britain is now experiencing is the gradual separation of the economic relations between the colonies, autonomous territories, and dependencies and Britain. At the same time, with the expansion of the power of the American group, the market for British goods is shrinking, and the amount of investment in the international investment market is gradually shrinking. Since Britain felt the pain of this situation, the Ottawa Conference was held last year. The purpose of the conference was to solve trade and tariff issues. In the end, twelve agreements were established and new tax rates were implemented. The Union of South Africa even implemented a ban on external tariffs based on the agreement. Other territories and dependencies are also preparing to raise tariffs. These facts are all new activities for Britain to realize her group.</p>
<p>(3) The economic group centered on France. This group is formed by France itself, Guinea, Algiers and other North African colonies, plus Madagascar, Annam and other colonies. France's industrial development is later than that of Britain and the United States, so the exported goods and the capital invested are relatively less. Trade has not been as smooth as that of Britain and the United States. Before the war, there was often a surplus. In 1928, with the stability of the French franc, there was also a deficit. However, there were German reparations and various income other than trade, and the cash of various countries was concentrated in France. At the end of 1932, France's gold reserves reached 66.6 billion French francs, tying with the United States as the world's largest. It has long harbored ambitions for Central Europe. Now Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Belgium are all under its command, forming a group that opposes Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>(4) Japan has now become one of the world's four major economic groups. However, its industry and commerce are not yet enough to compete with Europe and the United States. The reason is that on the one hand, industry is backward, due to the immaturity of industrial technology and the lack of capital, and on the other hand, Japan's industry is a monopolistic situation. The marketing of its goods is also limited to Asia and Southeast Asia. The economic power of Europe and the United States is expanding eastward, making Japan more urgent. Therefore, Japan took the lead in seizing our country's Northeast Provinces in order to obtain a permanent place for marketing goods and supplying raw materials. On our country's side, it will start from the Northeast Provinces and invade North China to complete the scope of its economic group, forming an East Asian Monroe Doctrine to consolidate its group and avoid conflicts with the economic groups of other countries.</p>
<p>Under this situation, how should our country cope so as not to be destroyed by foreign economic aggression? This is not the responsibility of the industrial and commercial sectors alone, but the most important responsibility of our entire country at present.</p>
<h3>Industry and Commerce in the Period of National Crisis</h3>
<p>— Fengwu</p>
<p>The closing account for the year 21 of the Republic of China passed ten days ago. Before the closing account, market rumors were frequently spread, alarming people, because the year (21st year) was one in which our country's industry and commerce encountered unprecedented difficulties. Due to the January 28th Incident, the closing account for the year 20 was repeatedly postponed and was not actually held until the closing account period last year, when it was settled at the same time. This has caused inconvenience to the financial and industrial and commercial sectors. In addition, although economic experts from various countries have tried their best to solve the world economy, the desolation and embarrassment are no less than in the past. The number of unemployed people is only increasing, not decreasing. The sluggish sales of agricultural and industrial products remain the same. Those who own a large amount of gold are accumulating it because it is inconvenient and dare not lend it out, which is suitable for its yellow swelling disease. Countries lacking gold have hyperinflation, rising prices, and increasingly difficult livelihoods. For example, the national cost of living index in Japan (December last year) increased by 4.7 percent compared with the same month of the previous year. The general working class is not only suffering from unemployment, but also trapped by life. However, countries are still not aware and are still building high tariff barriers to block the import of competing products. On the one hand, they sell surplus commodities to overseas markets. If the power of their own country is insufficient, they unite with other parts to cooperate and plan. If they cannot unite, they do not hesitate to send troops without a name and forcibly occupy other people's land in order to realize their attempt to sell goods and collect raw materials. Countries have the strength, either gold or force, so they can only block each other and do not suffer much loss. The losers are still our country. Due to historical relations, our country has not only removed its national defense barriers, but also opened its economic doors. Foreign goods are continuously imported, allowing a lot of money to go away without being able to save it. Although the tariff is said to be autonomous, it can still protect our high-level industries. Moreover, countries only seek to have their products sold, regardless of the price. Therefore, despite the impact of rising gold prices, imported goods are still pouring in like a tide. The emerging industries in our country are being devastated by the dumping of foreign goods and cannot stand on their own feet. Moreover, the products of the factories have to rely on foreign countries for most of their raw materials, so their ability to resist the invasion of foreign goods is even weaker. Since the January 28th Incident, domestic and foreign trade has been cut off. Unexpectedly, the export of tea has been seized by India and Ceylon in the British market, and the road to the United States and the Philippines has been occupied by Japanese tea. The market price of silk has fallen sharply, which is unprecedented. The silkworm farmers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang are all complaining. Exports are also bleak. The two things that have failed are silk and tea, which have been relied on for years to offset the import surplus, such as soybeans, peanuts, oil cakes, etc. Except for peanuts, beans are also special products of the Northeast Provinces. After being forcibly occupied, there is less income in our country's foreign trade, and the import surplus figure is even more inflated. Other things that can be relied on to offset it are also being encroached on. How can the country's wealth not become increasingly tight? In addition, the bandit and communist disasters have not yet been eliminated, and foreign insults are still being resisted. Our industry and commerce are still able to maintain the status quo in this turbulent situation, which is very gratifying.</p>
<p>As a result of last year's closing account, the money industry adhered to its cautious approach and worked hard to tighten up, so its changes were very small. It is rumored that this year's exchanges will be more cautious. Under this state, it is best to be cautious, but the financial and industrial and commercial sectors are like teeth that depend on each other. It seems that they should actively support their development while cautiously releasing loans in order to break through this difficult situation.</p>
<h3>Qimen's 'Black Tea' and 'Red Tide Ointment'</h3>
<p>— Ying</p>
<p>China's tea industry is declining and is about to enter a period of decline! Of course, this is not only the case with the tea industry. In the collapse of the entire rural area, it can be said that no agricultural product is not suffering from severe panic!</p>
<p>Three months ago, I had the opportunity to spend more than ten days climbing mountains and crossing ridges to Qimen, the most famous black tea producing area in China. Qimen is truly a remote and poor place. The total education expenses for the whole year are less than 13,000 yuan, and the only district office seen along the way has a school that looks like a private school. The students are still reading books such as Elementary Learning and Prodigy Poems.</p>
<p>But Qimen's black tea is indeed the most suitable production area. The mountains are towering, the trees are lush, and the Changjiang River runs through the southwest towns. Before ten o'clock in the morning, the mountains and fields were shrouded in heavy fog. Tea is a plant that likes to be dry and also needs to be humid. It is planted on sloping mountains and has deep clouds and fog. It is truly in its place! The black tea in the two lakes in Jiangxi has been crushed by Indian Ceylon tea, and the entire army has been wiped out. However, Qimen black tea can still barely struggle, and in the previous year, each load reached the highest price of more than 300 taels of silver. This is probably due to the unique advantages!</p>
<p>The history of Qimen's black tea production is only a few decades. In the 36th year before the Republic of China, a man named Yu from Huizhou saw that the land was sparsely populated and the price of tea was cheap, so he began to introduce the method of black tea production. On the one hand, he set up villages to buy it, and gradually became prosperous. In the beginning, the market price was lower than that of Ningzhou tea. In recent years, the quantity exported from Qimen has been about 25,000 loads. At an average of 100 yuan per load, Qimen's total annual income is as much as 2.5 million yuan.</p>
<p>With such a small county, it can have such a large amount of cash flowing in every year. Isn't this the most promising and richest place in the country? Moreover, the famous porcelain produced in Jingdezhen, its raw material, white porcelain clay, is also mostly produced in Qimen. In addition, the annual quantity of wood and other agricultural products produced is also very large.</p>
<p>It is pitiful to say that most of the male and female workers who pick tea and make tea come from other counties; opium dens are everywhere; and the prevalence of gambling is also the highest in various places. This is still irrelevant to the overall situation. The most terrible thing is the hot sales of red pills. The daily quantity of opium smoking is ultimately limited. If they are addicted, they can still prolong their lives for ten or twenty years. The red pill is made of morphine heroin, etc. When eating it, they can smoke and eat all day long. If they are addicted, even the best opium is no match for the addiction; and after eating the red pill, whether male or female, fertility is stopped. According to local people's estimates, six or seven out of ten men in Qimen are addicted, and the expenditure on red pills alone reaches more than 1.5 to 600,000 yuan per year. Therefore, the people of Qimen call the red pill the red tide of Qimen, (Huiyin tide tea through) This red tide is not only wasting money, but also destroying the species and exterminating the tribe. The source of this red pill is of course imported by foreign imperialists; and the local military police cannot but bear the full responsibility for the local ability to transport and sell it!</p>
<p>It is said that Qimen is like this, and so are the towns in Huizhou, but not as terrible as Qimen; and the same is true of the rural areas in other provinces. Then this red tide is not only in Qimen, but has spread to the entire China!</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Fishing Vessel Industry Last Year Under Japanese Aggression</h3>
<p>— Qu Ruo</p>
<p>Shanghai is located on the coast of the East China Sea and is a pivotal hub for industry and commerce. Fishing vessels engaged in fishing in the outer seas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces generally use this city as their base for entry, exit, and operations. Over time, it has gradually become the center of China's modern fishing industry. Although the monthly catch value is not as large as that of imported goods, it is still no less than seventy to eighty thousand yuan. Currently, there are eight trawlers entering and leaving Shanghai Port, with a total tonnage of approximately 1,500 tons. There are four pairs of hand-operated net fishing vessels (eight vessels; hand-operated fishing vessels must work in pairs, similar to the old paired-boat fishing operations), with a total tonnage of approximately 320 tons. Their fishing grounds are located northeast of the Huanao Islands off the Yangtze River estuary, northeast of the Sheshan Islands, and near Haijiao Reef. However, some also sail to the vicinity of Buding Island or even the outer seas of Wenzhou Bay. The aforementioned locations are rich in marine resources, especially large and small yellow croakers, [unidentified characters], which are the most abundant. Next are hairtail, swimming crabs, cuttlefish, sole, sea bream, whitebait, and lizardfish. A list of fishing grounds and catches by month is provided below:</p>
<p>Month　　　Fishing Ground　　　Catch</p>
<p>January　Northeast of Huanao Islands, near Haijiao Reef　　Croaker, Conger Eel</p>
<p>February　Zhoushan Islands, East of Dadong Island, Haijiao Reef　　Croaker, Conger Eel, Small Yellow Croaker</p>
<p>March　Northeast of Huanao Islands, Northeast of Sheshan Islands　　Croaker, Eel, Small Yellow Croaker</p>
<p>April, May, June　Northeast of Sheshan Islands　　Small and Large Yellow Croakers, Cuttlefish, Eel</p>
<p>July, August, September　Northeast of Huanao and Sheshan Islands, Zhoushan Islands, East of Dadong Island　　Small Yellow Croaker, Eel</p>
<p>October, November　Northeast of Huanao Islands, near Haijiao Reef　　Eel</p>
<p>December　Near Haijiao Reef, East of Sanmen Bay　　Sea Bream, Croaker, Eel</p>
<p>(Note) The fish listed in the table refer to the most abundant types. The types with the largest catches are listed first, followed by the rest in descending order.</p>
<p>The number of fishing trips per year for each fishing vessel is usually thirty. Last year, due to the impact of the January 28th Incident, most vessels did not go out to sea in February and March. In July and August, the vessels underwent annual maintenance, so the number of fishing trips for the whole year was only eight months, and the catch was not as good as before. In addition, losses were incurred due to the increase in the prices of consumables such as coal and ice. Therefore, most of the twelve companies only barely covered their expenses.</p>
<p>Last year, the regular expenses of each company totaled approximately fifty to sixty thousand yuan. Broken down, crew salaries were 12,000 yuan per year, the purchase of fishing gear and vessel equipment was over 1,000 yuan per year, and the consumption of ice for preserving fresh fish was quite large. The amount loaded during fishing trips varied depending on the coldness of the weather, generally around 90,000 catties in summer and 30,000 to 40,000 catties in winter. On average, each fishing trip required about 6 dan, and the price also varied depending on the coldness, ranging from 15 cents to 70 or 80 cents. The average price per dan was about 25 cents, so the ice expenditure was 4,000 to 5,000 yuan per year. In addition, the most expensive item was the consumption of fuel for the fishing vessels. For steam-powered trawlers, each fishing trip required about 50 to 60 tons of coal, and the price was about 15 yuan per ton, totaling 30,000 yuan per year. (Chinese fishing vessels used diesel, and the cost was similar.) Adding other miscellaneous expenses and company overhead, the annual expenditure was around 20,000 yuan. This is a general overview of trawler companies. For hand-operated net fishing, the cost was relatively lower. Last year, each company spent about 30,000 yuan.</p>
<p>As for the value of last year's catch, Yongmao Fishing Vessel had the highest value, but the commission for fish dealers was not deducted from its price. The following is a list:</p>
<p>Fishing Vessel Company Name　　　Fishing Vessel Name　　Number of Fishing Trips　　Quantity (Dan)　　Price (Yuan)</p>
<p>Yongsheng Fishing Vessel Bureau　　　Yongmao　　　26　　7,145.89　　74,150.94</p>
<p>Lianxing Fishing Vessel Bureau　　　Lianfeng　　　28　　7,495.39　　67,574.60</p>
<p>Chen Jiageng Company　　　Jimei　　　5　　7,594.83　　67,035.32</p>
<p>Yongshun Fishing Vessel Bureau　　　Haishun　　　28　　7,239.37　　65,777.48</p>
<p>Maofeng Fishing Vessel Bureau　　　Maofeng　　　21　　7,452.74　　61,874.64</p>
<p>Zhonghua Shipping Company　　　Zhonghua　　　24　　8,359.16　　56,186.03</p>
<p>Yongfeng Fishing Vessel Bureau　　　Yongfeng　　　21　　5,168.95　　54,732.50</p>
<p>Sanxing Fishing Vessel Bureau　　　Haixing　　　23　　5,570.88　　47,059.15</p>
<p>Fusheng Fishing Vessel Bureau　　　Fusheng 1, 2　　4　　4,089.39　　42,124.40</p>
<p>Zhi Da Fishing Vessel Bureau　　　Da Fugui 18　　3　　3,780.28　　35,217.46</p>
<p>Zhejiang Fisheries School　　　Minsheng 1, 2　　6　　1,705.72　　16,946.50</p>
<p>Taixing Fishing Vessel Bureau　　　Taixing 1, 2　　3　　484.99　　3,786.79</p>
<p>(Note) The Haixing fishing vessel of Sanxing Fishing Vessel Bureau was leased to the Jiangsu Provincial Fisheries Experiment Station and was used for various experiments during fishing trips, so the catch was not abundant.</p>
<p>As shown in the above table, due to the overfishing by Japanese fishing vessels, the catch has been sharply reduced compared to previous years. However, the area of the sea outside the port suitable for fishing is still vast and awaits development. The price at which the catch is sold is most closely related to the fishing vessel industry. Sometimes, a good price cannot be obtained because although Shanghai has a large population, the daily consumption of marine fish is only sixty to seventy thousand catties. Therefore, once several fishing vessels arrive at the same time, the fish price drops due to the relationship between supply and demand. Ice-laden fresh fish boats also arrive in groups, and imported goods flood in, causing the market price to plummet. For example, the lowest price for yellow croaker in April last year was only 1.5 yuan per hundred catties, with an average price of only 1.5 fen per catty. This is a natural difficulty encountered in the fishing industry. To remedy this, fishing vessel companies should install radios on their fishing boats to report market prices at any time so that the arrival dates of fishing vessels can be selected accordingly. However, the overall solution still lies in opening up sales channels. For example, when the price of yellow croaker in Shanghai plummets, it is still regarded as a treasure in the interior. With convenient transportation, such as along the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou railway lines, the price has increased several times. Therefore, to promote the development of the fishing industry, it is necessary to transport the surplus yellow croaker from Shanghai to areas in the interior where yellow croaker is scarce. This can regulate market prices. On the one hand, cold storage should be established. When fish imports are booming and fish prices plummet, the fish can be stored for later sale. When the market is short of goods, the stored fish can be released to meet the market demand. This can regulate supply and demand and protect the interests of fishermen and merchants.</p>
<p>In addition, the pain felt by our country's fishing vessel industry due to the encroachment of Japanese fishing vessels is indescribable. Japanese fishermen use hundreds of fishing vessels every year to conduct large-scale cyclical fishing, resulting in a gradual decline in catches. They also smuggle goods into the country from time to time. Although customs authorities investigate and collect fishing taxes, Japanese vessels still use barges to transport goods or carry their catches to Qingdao and Dalian and then transport them by merchant ships. They habitually use dumping policies to destroy our fishing industry with the lowest prices. For example, on November 17th last year, the Japanese fishing vessel "O Maru" imported and dumped 48,000 catties of fish (mostly yellow croaker). The market price of this fish at that time was around 20 yuan per dan. After the dumping by this vessel, the fish price plummeted to 12 yuan, and later even reached 10 yuan. In the same period of the previous year (1931), the highest price of yellow croaker was from 35 yuan to 40 yuan. They sell products produced in China to the Chinese market, absorbing our country's money, amounting to tens of millions of yuan every year. At this time of hardship, can we not pay attention to seeking a remedy as soon as possible?</p>
<p>Although the fishing vessel industry was sluggish last year, Taixing Fishing Vessel Bureau was still established in November. The fishing vessels were named Taixing No. 1 and No. 2. Although the results since fishing have been immature, their contribution to the development of the country's fishing industry is admirable. It is hoped that investors will promptly invest in the burgeoning fishing industry and reclaim the lost rights and interests.</p>

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Bond Market Performed Well Last Week</p>
<p>Disarmament Bonds Rose Above 50 Yuan, 19 Customs Bonds Rose Above 40 Yuan</p>
<p>Last week, the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange Market resumed trading after a six-day closure. It coincided with the Lunar New Year, and the new exchange market was completed. The atmosphere was good, diplomatic relations were easing, the Northeast war seemed quieter, and silver market was loosening. Investor confidence was extremely strong. Banks slightly increased their purchases, which all contributed to the bullish trend. Furthermore, rumors were rampant in the market before the New Year, and most bulls, such as One and Thirty-Two, as well as most retail investors, had closed their positions for the New Year. Short sellers became crowded, so the opening market saw a big rise in trading, and each group was very happy and mostly bought. In the first two trading sessions in the morning, the bullish trend was particularly strong. 19 Customs Bonds almost rose above the 4-yuan limit. The second session was slightly calmer. On Tuesday, the market price was slightly chaotic due to some unfavorable news about the situation, but it continued to rise by a few cents due to short covering. On Wednesday, the market was weaker, and retail investors sold a lot, but Thirty-Eight and Forty-Five bought aggressively, and the market price recovered. On Thursday and Friday, it was widely rumored that hopes for peace were gradually being realized. Lan Pusen went to Beijing to mediate, and investor sentiment became more enthusiastic. Major investors increased their positions, and the financial sector continued to buy. Thirty-Eight and Forty-Seven had particularly strong appetites. Although some bulls emerged in Twenty-One, demand still exceeded supply. In two days, the price rose by another 3 yuan. On Saturday, there was a slight reversal, falling by a few cents to more than 1 yuan. Overall, the bond market performed well throughout the week. The prices of various bonds rose significantly, such as the Disarmament Bonds rising above 50 yuan, and the 19 Customs Bonds, 19 Charity Bonds, Consolidated Tax, and the Sixth Year Bonds all rising above 40 yuan. The bond market showed signs of recovery. As a result of the week, prices rose from 2 yuan and a few cents to about 4.5 yuan. Among them, the Disarmament Bonds rose the most, by 4.65 yuan, the Sixth Year Bonds rose 3.6 yuan, and the rest also rose about 3 yuan. The total trading volume was only two sessions in the morning each day, with a total trading volume of 29,018,000 yuan. Among them, spot three bonds were 30,000 yuan, forward consolidated tax was 6,770,000 yuan, consolidated tax was over 4,400,000 yuan, and the rest were around 3,000,000 yuan. 18 Customs Bonds were over 400,000 yuan, and 96 Gold Bonds were only 70,000 to 80,000 yuan.

<h3>Grain: Rice Market Up in Southern Shanghai, Down in Northern Shanghai</h3>
<p>(Southern Shanghai) Yesterday, the arrival of rice from the 20s and 30s was better, and urban and rural shops purchased a little. Wholesale merchants continued to purchase, with about 1,800 shi of goods on the upper stacks. Therefore, investor sentiment was upward, and prices followed suit. Rice from Suzhou and Qingjiao rose by a few cents. Although there were sales from the Southern Port rice, there were also many arrivals, and the market price did not fluctuate much. Yinyuan rice continued to be in short supply, and the highest prices had already been raised. There was no Yangjian rice available, and only a few Lujian rice arrived. Only verbal offers were good, and the price did not change. Factory-produced Yangjian rice remained at the old price. Early rice was only offered at 9.5 yuan. The prices of rice in dou are as follows (unit: yuan):</p>
<p>Tongli White Glutinous Rice　7.90 to 7.85　Qingjiao Late Rice　8.20 to 7.90</p>

<h3>Soybean Cake: Some Buying in Rural Villages</h3>
<p>Transactions in the miscellaneous grains market were slightly scarce due to Sunday. Transactions in raw peanuts opened for three cars, and the market appeared stable and weak. This was due to the reported low market prices in the producing areas and the sluggish market in Guangdong. Therefore, the transaction was light. The price of raw peanuts from Kaifeng, which were traded yesterday, was 6 liang and 8 qian. Both arrivals and sales of soybeans continued. Investors' sentiment saw an improvement in cake sales, and factories purchased six cars of train soybeans. Therefore, the owners were reluctant to sell, and the market situation tended to be stable. Moreover, Dalian soybeans from the community workshops gradually sold. Therefore, the prospects gradually improved. The initial sales of soybean cake were only for customary transactions in rural villages in the interior. Therefore, there was still little formal market. Later, it is hoped that the export sector will be active, and both cake and soybeans will be boosted. Dujian soybeans, with large grains, were in strong demand in Guangdong. Therefore, in the midst of both arrivals and sales, the market remained firm and stable. Red sorghum was closely followed by rural buyers, and the price in the producing areas did not loosen. Therefore, the market stood firm. The following are the market conditions for the miscellaneous grains traded by the Miscellaneous Grains Association:</p>
<p>▲Soybean　　　▲Dujian Soybean　　　▲Red Sorghum</p>
<p>Dalian Yellow 4.44　Taicang Du 4.10　Niuzhuang Sorghum 2.55</p>
<p>to 4.37 ▲White Sesame to 2.40</p>

<p>Dachang, Juchang, He, Factory Soybean Cake 2,000 pieces, 14 liang 1 qian to 14 liang</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Jinchang's First Market Has Opened</h3>
<p>[Thirteen liang to eleven liang seven qian]</p>
<p>Yesterday, due to the small number of imports in the sugar market, the previous day's selling price was still soft, with a flat and weak trend. The association划盘 (grading and trading) group of 24 white granulated sugar划盘 at 15 liang and 6.5 qian, with a few transactions. No. 20 and No. 18 medium white granulated sugar, as well as No. 80 and 90 Dutch red sugar, were划出 (traded). The 号盘 (brand market) had Jinchang Dalaihua opening its brand of 270 cases of建冰 (block ice), with the standard Five Happiness White Block Ice priced at 13 liang per dan. Wangmao was priced at 12 liang and 8 qian, Peacock at 12 liang and 7 qian, Double Lions at 12 liang and 2 qian, and the brothers were at the same price. Lion Ball Yuchun was 12 liang, and Taimei was 11 liang and 7 qian, all sold at a discount of 82% of the market scale, 50 of the new regulations.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Tea Merchants Buying Hardware</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and due to the small number of arrivals in the hardware market, the volume of transactions for each type of goods was not large. Therefore, the market price did not fluctuate much. However, the usually quiet tea merchants suddenly bought a large quantity of hardware, amounting to 1,000 dan. It was found that there were still several months before the new tea season. These merchants, seeing the low prices of various goods in Shanghai, bought in advance to prepare for unforeseen needs. The goods purchased included more than 200 barrels of No. 2 zinc sheets, priced at 26 liang and 2.5 qian; and more than 400 dan of green lead, priced at 12 liang, which was 2 qian and 5 fen cheaper than the opening price. Fifty barrels of 125 Benchang Yuan zinc were priced at 8 liang and 2.5 qian per barrel. It was heard that the above goods were</p>
<h3>The Fish in the Basin</h3>
<p>— Wang Cijun</p>
<p>Around the end of the old lunar year, every family, due to the New Year's market closures, had to prepare some daily necessities in advance. At this time, I happened to see in a friend's house that they had bought a carp to cook for wine during the New Year.</p>
<p>The porcelain basin was filled with clear water, and a slightly blue-black carp was leisurely swimming inside; the movement of its fins and tail stirred up countless ripples in the porcelain basin. People standing nearby could faintly hear the sound of the water touching the edge of the porcelain basin. The fish floated up and down as it pleased, its eyes emitting a slightly reddish light. The movement of its gills and the pulsation of a person's veins formed a peaceful duet.</p>
<p>But just as this tranquil scene unfolded, my friend came over; he subconsciously looked at the lively carp, a subtle smile appearing on his face; as if contemplating that this fish would soon provide him with something to accompany his wine. In these times of war and chaos, when no sound of cannons or guns could be heard, to celebrate the New Year with fine wine and delicacies was truly a delightful thing! His smile was, of course, in line with human nature and the natural order of things.</p>
<p>But I silently worried for this fish: I could foresee that the maid would soon casually catch it, put it on the cutting board, and use the back of a knife to scrape off the fish scales, piece by piece. The fish felt pain and struggled desperately. At that moment, the maid would swiftly cut open the fish's abdomen, fresh red blood would spurt out, and it would still try to escape, struggling continuously. But its intestines, liver, and lungs would soon be discarded into a bowl. Only a repulsive fishy smell would assault people's nostrils.</p>
<p>As I silently contemplated this, the mahjong game in the next room stopped, and a burst of noise erupted. I knew this was the situation after four rounds had ended and they were switching directions; if they didn't have this moment of leisure, during the serious period of concentrated play, how could they roar so loudly! I casually listened, but another thought welled up in my mind: what is the difference between our group of four hundred million civilized Chinese and the fish in the basin? The enemy's gleaming knives and guns, sharp cannons, swift airplanes, and massive battleships are emitting ferocious laughter at us day and night, constantly hoping to kill people off completely, while we, this group of compatriots awaiting slaughter, are still vying for superiority, comparing strength and weakness, deceiving and fighting each other, treating the enemy as if they don't exist; a group of leisurely and contented scholars are lingering over wine and enjoying the bamboo forests, unaware of the anxieties of the times, what difference is there between this and the fish swimming in the basin, enjoying themselves?</p>
<p>Oh, people intoxicated in dreams of fine wine and beautiful women, please listen to how desolate the mournful reed pipes north of the border are, don't always be as carefree as the fish in the basin!</p>
<h3>Honesty</h3>
<p>— He Jiagan</p>
<p>Reality is often not as pleasant as it seems on the surface. For example, this "Free Talk" is not really very free. Now that it's called "Free Talk," we can at least say we're talking freely here. Similarly, regarding the recent removal of antiquities from Beiping and the ban on university students fleeing, those who issued the orders have their reasons, and those who criticize have their reasons, but these are all superficial aspects, not the essence.</p>
<p>If it's said that antiquities are very old, unique, and therefore treasures that should be moved quickly, that certainly makes sense. But we don't have two Beipings, and the land itself is older than any existing antiquity. We won't talk about the time when Yu was a worm, but even during the Shang and Zhou dynasties, this place certainly existed. Why leave it behind and only move the antiquities? In fact, it's not because of the antiquities' antiquity, but because after "non-resistance," they can still be carried around and sold for cash at any time.</p>
<p>Although university students are "backbone elements," they don't have market value. If they were worth five hundred US dollars each in the European and American markets, they would certainly be packed into boxes and transported out of Beiping with the antiquities in special trains, hidden in the vaults of foreign banks in the concessions.</p>
<p>But university students are plentiful and new, alas!</p>
<p>Better to say less nonsense, and instead use Cui Hao's "Yellow Crane Tower" poem to lament the situation:</p>
<p>The wealthy have ridden culture away, leaving behind an empty cultural city.</p>
<p>Culture, once gone, will never return, the ancient city remains desolate for millennia.</p>
<p>Special train convoys line up at Qianmen Station, a cloud of misfortune hangs over university students.</p>
<p>Where can one resist as the sun sets beyond Yuguan? No one is alarmed in the pleasure quarters.</p>
<h3>Su Xiaoxiao and the White Snake</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>| Lecture at Suzhou Provincial Girls' Middle School |</p>
<p>Today I'm going to talk about the stories of Su Xiaoxiao and the White Snake. Storytelling is Suzhou's greatest strength; for me to come to Suzhou and tell the story of the White Snake is like "teaching a carpenter how to saw!"</p>
<p>The Su Xiaoxiao and White Snake I'm going to talk about are slightly different from what you all know; I'm using the West Lake tales as my blueprint. I have never met Su Xiaoxiao; past literati and poets have always said she had a beautiful face and moon-like appearance, and that's probably not wrong. At the age of seventeen or eighteen, she would sit in a painted carriage every day on the lake embankment, attracting tourists; immediately, there would be many "wealthy young masters, scholars, and local gentry, wanting to take her as a concubine, willing to offer thousands of gold pieces, eagerly coming to propose." Think about it: having Western-style houses to live in, cars to ride in, and leisurely being a rich man's concubine, wouldn't that be good? So Aunt Jia came to advise her, saying, "Girl, don't make the wrong decision, a prostitute marrying into a wealthy family, even if she's a concubine, is still better than greeting and seeing off guests in the brothel, forcing herself to be cheerful." Do you know what Su Xiaoxiao was thinking? She said, "What I love most is the scenery of West Lake, if I enter a cage, I can only sit in a well and look at the sky, unable to roam the Two Peaks and Three Temples. Moreover, wealth, nobility, poverty, and humbleness all depend on fate; if fate truly had a golden house in store for me, I definitely wouldn't have been born into a prostitute's family; now that I'm born into a prostitute's family, it's clear that I don't have the fate of a golden house. If I enter a wealthy household... luxury is not a lasting thing, wealth has no constant affection, it's easy to get in, but difficult to stand out, it's better to move the famous flowers of Jingu to the middle of the market, everyone who smells them loves their fragrance, everyone who sees them loves their beauty... If I can be an outstanding beauty in a brothel, wouldn't that be better than being a follower in a wealthy household?" After she debuted, she turned thousands of men in the palm of her hand, "If she's tired, no one dares to force a word out of her; when she's happy, people eagerly pursue her... No one ever teases her suddenly, or shouts wildly, to add to her displeasure. Therefore, in social interactions with cups and formalities, people labor themselves while she rests; the beauty lies in casually uttering a word in her coldness, suddenly glancing, like comfort or relief, which already makes people's souls melt." Once, Supervisor Meng called a painted boat on West Lake and invited guests, insisting that Su Xiaoxiao come to pour wine; Su Xiaoxiao refused repeatedly, and Supervisor Meng was furious, wanting to punish her severely, and the local government was secretly worried for her. Who knew that once Su Xiaoxiao arrived, a frown or a word would make Supervisor Meng smile with joy! Later, Su Xiaoxiao caught a cold and became seriously ill; the doctors who came to see her all said it was more ominous than auspicious, and her Aunt Jia was very anxious for her, but she thought that after being a prostitute for a few years, she had fully enjoyed wealth and prosperity, and tasted all the flavors of romance; dying early like this, leaving a good impression on the world, was actually Heaven's intention to fulfill her, and she was happy to complete it, she died at the age of only nineteen. After she died, the withered bones at the head of Xiling Bridge became the subject of poems for poets for thousands of years, endlessly humming "Here on the lake and mountains, jade was once buried."</p>
<p>Putting Su Xiaoxiao aside, let's talk about the White Snake under the Leifeng Pagoda across from Xiling Bridge. The White Snake is a white snake, as everyone knows; Xiaoqing, according to the Legend of the White Snake, is a green snake, according to the West Lake Tales, is a green fish, there's no way to verify, so we won't insist on that. When the White Snake met Xu Xuan, she was a woman wearing mourning clothes; since she had already lost her husband, she could have rested, why "a young widow visiting the grave," seeing a "pretty boy," and stirring up "old waves in a still well"? She painstakingly enticed Xu Xuan, by boat, by borrowing an umbrella, by inviting him for tea, by inviting him for wine, single-mindedly wanting to marry him; Xu Xuan didn't have money to support a family, she took out fifty-tael ingots to give to him, these ingots were stolen from the Grand Commandant's treasury. Xu Xuan was exiled to the prison city, and the White Snake brought Xiaoqing to the prison city, wholeheartedly acting as his housekeeper, letting Xu Xuan live a comfortable life. Xu Xuan, on one hand, lusted after the White Snake's beauty, and on the other hand, was tormented by the thought of her being a demon; in the prison city, he believed in the Taoist priest's charmed water, and in Zhenjiang, he believed in the Buddha-dharma of the Great Monk of Jinshan Temple, insisting on forcing the White Snake to flee back to West Lake. The ending is such a tragedy: the White Snake was sitting there combing her hair, Xu Xuan took the alms bowl of Chan Master Fahai, quietly went home, and taking advantage of her not paying attention, approached her from behind, put the alms bowl over her head, using all his strength, and trapped the White Snake inside. As soon as Chan Master Fahai arrived, the White Snake and Xiaoqing both revealed their original forms. The Chan Master trapped them inside the alms bowl, took them to the front of Leifeng Temple, and had people move bricks and stones, build a pagoda base, and press it on top of them; later, many people were willing to do good deeds, and before long, they built a huge Leifeng Pagoda. Chan Master Fahai also left four lines of verse: "When Leifeng Pagoda falls, the West Lake dries up, the tidal bore does not rise, the White Snake will be born." (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Crossroads of Era and Love (Continued Draft)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>He smelled the fragrance emanating from her skin while listening to Hua Erzi's music, !! da da da, da da da, !! the music seemed to be telling him, kiss her, kiss her!"</p>
<p>His heart quickened, and his whole body seemed to lose strength. Madam Hezi's cheeks also seemed to be Sovietized.</p>
<p>"Da da da! Da da da! ...................................................."</p>
<p>She just giggled and hugged him tighter. He only hated that it was a cold day, and the clothes on his body were a bit too thick. The distance between her cheek and his was at most half an inch. Her breath at this moment was no longer the smell of Acetylene gas, but seemed to have changed into another kind of alcoholic fragrance. His mind was, after all, rational, and from her breathing, he thought of the changes in her digestive organs. Before going to T Tea House, her stomach lacked air elements and didn't have enough oxidizing power, so it emitted the smell of Acetylene gas. After eating dinner at T Tea House, with a sufficient supply of air elements, it was transformed into the smell of carbohydrates.</p>
<p>"Ah!"</p>
<p>He was lost in thought and didn't pay attention to what was behind him! His buttocks touched a woman dancing behind him. "I'm sorry! ......................................"</p>
<p>He nodded slightly to the couple.</p>
<p>"Ah! ........................................."</p>
<p>He recognized the woman as Mrs. Ren, Ms. Liu Peizhen! He felt a kind of surprise. He couldn't help but want to see if her partner was Ren Jinhua. But he only glanced and knew it wasn't. The opponent was a bit older than Master Ren, but his body seemed more magnificent and larger than Master Ren's, like a giant.</p>
<p>Peizhen seemed very embarrassed to meet him in this dance hall. She only nodded back with a red face and didn't say anything more to him.</p>
<p>The ordinary electric lights came on. Everyone returned to their seats. He couldn't help but pay attention to Mrs. Ren's appearance. He wouldn't have noticed if he hadn't looked, but once he looked, he was really startled. Behind the gentleman accompanying her to dance stood two uniformed men, like his bodyguards. He thought. What kind of important person is that gentleman? Why isn't Ren Jinhua seen coming with everyone?</p>
<p>The white electric light dimmed again. Colored, dim electric lights were switched on. Ah Chishtura played the music for a foxtrot.</p>
<p>"Dance?"</p>
<p>Madam Hezi asked Haiquan with a smile.</p>
<p>"Let's rest once. ....................."</p>

<h3>After All, It's Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Fearless</p>
<p>Shanghai is, after all, Shanghai, a scene of prosperity. The scars of war left by the enemy no longer appear in people's minds, unless... the sound of firecrackers drives away the bad luck of last year. At this time last year, the enemy's iron birds were no longer flying in the sky, but shaking people's hearts with the sound of cannons and machine guns. Unless it's sent from the Northeast by radio, it won't vibrate people's eardrums anymore. People wouldn't think that this is a time of national crisis. As long as it's not fighting in Shanghai, to hell with it. At most, those with better memories would occasionally say after tea and wine, "This time last year was really a time of fleeing."</p>
<p>Cars roll on the asphalt road, pale green teenagers and modern girls squeeze into the corners of the car, blood-like wine, the trembling of flesh, love words, and music sway in the air in the dance halls, the sound of gongs and drums is deafening in the amusement park, performing Farewell My Concubine, the boss in the movie theater smiles and the "full house" sign is hung high.</p>
<p>Neon lights illuminate the roadside, the sound of military bands and city noises interact, the flags of big discounts flutter, the national products that have changed their appearance are on sale, the boss. customers, everyone gets a bargain, the radio broadcasts storytelling, lullabies, and jokes, people stand in front of the store and listen leisurely, the long-term shouts only make people know that Yuguan has fallen, but what about Shanghai? After all, it's Shanghai, a scene of prosperity.</p>
<p>Occasionally thinking of the volunteer army in the Northeast, then there's a total mobilization of entertainment to relieve the volunteer army in the Northeast. Although this grand meeting has closed, dancing to save the country, prostitutes to save the country, entertaining to save the country are still in progress, so Shanghai is, after all, Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Simple Method for Identifying Textile Fibers</h3>
<p>— Tianying</p>
<p>The raw materials for clothing are broadly divided into two types: animal fibers and plant fibers. Commonly used animal fibers include wool and silk; plant fibers include cotton, hemp, and rayon. These types of fibers are not easy to distinguish without close examination, and now that science is flourishing and research is becoming more sophisticated, different fibers are often mixed in, and various processing methods are applied to the fabrics, the most common being bleaching, glazing, dyeing, and washing. They only care about the beauty and attractiveness of the fabrics, and disregard the damage to the fibers, making it difficult for customers to distinguish them. Now, I will select the simple methods of identification and describe them below for the readers.</p>
<p>(A) Identification by the naked eye or by burning</p>
<p>Take a single fiber, or extract several fibers from one end of the fabric, and ignite it with fire. If the flame is dark and unclear, with a special unpleasant odor, like burning hair or fingernails, and the burning is slow, curling up, and finally produces black, lumpy ash, then this is animal fiber such as wool or silk. Conversely, if the flame emitted during burning is like burning paper, and it burns quickly, with a slightly foul odor, resulting in white or off-white, non-lumpy ash, then this is plant fiber such as cotton. But it should be noted that the acetic acid cellulose silk in rayon also burns slowly and produces black, lumpy ash. The difference between it and silk wool is only that its burning is not as curled as silk wool.</p>
<p>The above only distinguishes whether the fibers of the fabric belong to animal or plant origin. As for what kind of fiber it is, it is more difficult to identify clearly. Now, I will select its characteristics for simple identification.</p>
<p>Silk has a noble and beautiful luster. When touched by hand, it feels quite smooth and has strong strength. Its fibers are finer than other fibers.</p>
<p>Wool fibers are inferior to silk, and when touched on the skin, they feel slightly furry and unpleasant. The quality is softer, so fabrics made from it are not easily wrinkled.</p>
<p>The quality of cotton is soft; when touched by hand, it is slightly firmer than silk wool.</p>
<p>Hemp fibers are stiff and have few feathers, and they are good conductors of heat. Clothes made from the fabric have a cold feeling when worn, so many people wear them in summer.</p>
<p>Rayon has a strong and beautiful luster, with a coarse and hard nature. When immersed in water, its strength decreases greatly, much more than when it is dry, making it easy to distinguish from domestic silkworm silk.</p>
<p>In short, if the same raw material is due to different thickness, density, twisting strength, finishing methods, and other procedures, the quality obtained often has differences: therefore, the naked eye is not a reliable identification method.</p>
<p>(B) Identification by chemicals</p>
<p>(1) Add five grams of lead monoxide to a 5% sodium hydroxide solution and boil until dissolved. After it dissolves, let it stand. Take the clear liquid on the upper layer and add the fiber to be tested, and observe carefully. If the fiber is wool, the sulfur in the wool will combine with the lead to form black lead sulfide precipitate, so the fiber turns black. Although silk is also an animal fiber, it does not contain sulfur, so it does not turn black.</p>
<p>(2) Take a test tube, add two cubic centimeters of 2% potassium hydroxide solution, and the fiber to be tested, and heat together. Add lead acetate. If there is a black precipitate, it is wool, for the same reason as (1).</p>
<p>(3) Silk can be completely dissolved in 4% hydrochloric acid in two minutes: but wool can only be dissolved in 5% hydrochloric acid, and its dissolution is also slower.</p>
<p>(4) Nitric acid can turn silk yellow and then dissolve it completely: wool fibers also turn yellow when exposed to nitric acid, but dissolve slowly. Cotton has no color with nitric acid. (5) In zinc chloride solution, silk can be temporarily dissolved, while wool and cotton remain insoluble.</p>
<p>(C) Identification by microscope</p>
<p>This method is the most reliable and accurate, because various fibers have their own special characteristics, making them easy to distinguish. For ordinary inspection, a lens of 200 to 600 times magnification is sufficient.</p>
<p>(1) Wool fibers are very coarse, and their epidermal cells often appear in the shape of fish scales, or like overlapping roof tiles.</p>
<p>(2) Silk fibers are finer and have no cotton-like texture. Many are arranged in pairs.</p>
<p>(3) Cotton fibers are thicker at both ends and have a twisted shape (spiral).</p>
<p>(4) Hemp fibers have no twisted shape, are coarse and straight, and have equally spaced coarse knots.</p>
<p>(5) The fibers of rayon vary depending on their type and manufacturing method. They are often flat or have longitudinal grooves.</p>

<p>Originally, the students of Zhenguang, during the last class of the day, seemed to have no mood to listen to the lecture, especially for the part of the class that the public recognized as hateful, like physics and chemistry; what's more, today is Saturday afternoon, and in the hearts of both male and female students, they had already planned to go home, watch a movie, or accompany their lovers to a crazy dance. Even the teachers, how could they not want to recover their extremely exhausted spirits of the week?</p>
<p>The school bell was finally struck, and the classroom was quiet, with only the sound of the janitor sweeping and coughing.</p>
<p>"Hey! How about a little drink tonight?" The physics and chemistry teacher Chen, lying on a small sofa in the teachers' dormitory, said smugly to the English teacher Huang.</p>
<p>"Mm."</p>
<p>"The dishes at XX Restaurant can be called second to none in Shanghai! I'm treating."</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll join you, I'll definitely join you."</p>
<p>Even though the north wind was howling in the street, and it was unbearably cold; pushing open the dazzling glass spring door of XX Restaurant, the warm air clearly made the inside and outside instantly become two different worlds! Light red and light green lights, beautiful landscape paintings, soft carpets, large and elastic sofas... thus earning each customer a sense of comfort and pleasure in their hearts out of thin air.</p>
<p>After ordering the dishes, Chen, who had long harbored the "intention of the drunkard," had obtained Huang's consent and opened a tip, calling a "tangchai" to play with.</p>
<p>"Well, don't be polite, sit down. Miss?..." Chen's words stopped. In his mind, the "tangchai" seemed to be a very familiar person in his memory, but he couldn't remember her for a moment. Moreover, at this time, in his blurred memory, she had become more beautiful and lovely than in the past!</p>
<p>"Haha, come have a drink!" Just as Chen was thinking, Huang was in high spirits and grabbed her arm and said.</p>
<p>"No, no, sorry sir, I have to go." Her shy, unnatural demeanor, from this weak tone, had a few points of terror. Finally, Chen and Huang both looked at her running out inexplicably.</p>
<p>"Hey, Lao Chen, why so disappointing? This whore!"</p>
<p>"Strange! Can a 'tangchai' bear to sacrifice? Not accepting business." Huang didn't hear Chen's answer and sighed slightly.</p>
<p>"She, I seem to recognize her," Chen said, "That's right, she is indeed a student from our school's X grade; alas! Wouldn't this ruin our school's reputation as the best in Shanghai?"</p>
<p>"Ah? Really, how embarrassing for lovers!" Huang said in surprise. Chen interrupted angrily and sternly, saying;</p>
<p>"Expulsion is a must! Eh! Mr. Huang?"</p>
<p>"We must use a calm mind to judge and handle it." Huang not only stopped his original smile but said very strictly; "Lao Chen, why would she do such a lowly thing? Of course, she's been driven by her environment, growing up in this evil society, people with weak wills are rarely unaffected by the oppression of life and go astray. Expulsion is too simplistic."</p>
<p>"Hey! Then wouldn't the school's reputation really be ruined?"</p>
<p>"Judging the situation and reasoning, we shouldn't have come to this 'red light district,' if the incident escalates, what will become of us?" Chen heard these words, as if hearing a morning bell, and lowered his head without saying a word.</p>
<h3>Son's Tuition Fee</h3>
<p>— Yan Ye</p>
<p>"Brother Xianggui! It's a rare New Year, why don't you go to the teahouse for a bit? Why are you frowning at home all day long? What's on your mind? Don't have one? We always discuss everything, why don't you talk to me!" Zhang Ade saw his neighbor Li Xianggui moping at home during the New Year, so he went over to ask him.</p>
<p>"Brother Ade! The New Year has just passed, and the school expenses are here again. Difficulties are piling up, how can I be at ease?" Li Xianggui said, still frowning.</p>
<p>Brother Xianggui! What school expenses? I don't understand. Please explain it clearly.</p>
<p>Brother Ade! Don't you understand school expenses? It means my son's school is about to start. It's a good thing that school starts early so he can study more, but a large sum of tuition fees, how can I get it to him?</p>
<p>"Oh! So that's what it is." Ade said only this and couldn't continue the conversation.</p>
<p>Xianggui sighed and said, "I'm already over fifty years old! Life is getting harder every year, I really want to give up on everything. You know how the harvest was last year. Although the crops were plentiful, the wheat price is so low, and rice is so cheap that it's like giving it away for free. And you know what happened to me last year. When my eldest daughter got married, the dowry wasn't much, but I'm already in debt for life. The back house is about to collapse, and repairing it will cost another hundred or so dollars. Can you imagine a small family like mine bearing these two major events? That's why we almost didn't make it through the New Year. On New Year's Eve, people demanding interest and collecting debts came and went, almost forcing me to hang myself. Finally, I bowed and pleaded to send them all away one by one. It's only been two or three days since that difficult time passed, and now I'm being forced to death by my son's tuition fees. How do you think I can be at ease? Today is only the fourth day of the New Year, the fifth day hasn't even passed yet, how can I go to borrow money from people? Besides, whether I can borrow it or not is still a question. Alas! I'm really going to be worried to death!"</p>
<p>Ade took a deep puff of his long pipe, then exhaled a thick cloud of smoke, and then said, "Brother Xianggui! That's right! You're really over fifty years old! You don't need to be a beast of burden for your children anymore! I think your Fangsheng has studied for a few years, but it's not worth anything. Yesterday he was at my house, and I asked him if he still knows how to farm and draw water. He said, 'I've forgotten those things long ago.' After studying, he even forgot his old trade of farming. Don't you think that's a joke? I see him these days not wearing a long gown or a mandarin jacket, but wearing foreign clothes, and wearing a soft red hat on his head, jumping around in the east village and west village all day long. What kind of appearance is that? Brother Xianggui! An honest person only tells the truth, are you angry at these words? I don't care if you're angry or not, I advise you to let him farm, don't let him study."</p>
<p>Xianggui sighed again and said, "I also want to stop him from studying, but he just won't agree, and I don't know what to do." "When do you need to get the tuition fee to him?" Ade then asked.</p>
<p>Xianggui said, "It's needed by the sixth day. Their school is scheduled to start on February 1st according to the Western calendar, and February 1st is the seventh day of the Chinese New Year, so he has to leave the day after tomorrow, the sixth day. There's only one day left tomorrow, and tomorrow is the fifth day, do you think I'm not going to be worried to death?"</p>
<p>Ade also sighed deeply and asked, "Then how much money do you need in total?"</p>
<p>"Tuition fee is twenty-two dollars, food money is thirty-six dollars, miscellaneous expenses are five dollars, book money is more than ten dollars, and there are many kinds of two or three dollars, all in all, I have to give him at least one hundred dollars before he can leave." Xianggui said weakly to Ade.</p>
<p>Just then, a young man in a suit, wearing a soft red hat, and leather shoes jumped in from outside. Still some distance from Xianggui, he loudly said, "Dad: I'm definitely leaving the day after tomorrow, have you borrowed the tuition fee?"</p>
<p>Xianggui and Ade looked at him and couldn't say a word.</p>

<h3>The Signs of National Subjugation Editor:</h3>
<p>Recently, I have sensed a mood of national subjugation, and I wanted to say a few words to alert my compatriots. However, my knowledge and experience are too immature, and I never had the courage to write. Now, I will write down what I have seen. You, sir, are a social pathologist and also a doctor of the nation. Please write a diagnosis and prescribe a remedy!</p>
<p>Since the "September 18th" incident when Shenyang was lost, followed by the loss of Jinzhou, the alarm in Zhabei, and the threat to the Yangtze River coast, after each incident, the patriotic fervor of the people has continued to grow. During the Shanghai War, the patriotism of the people near Shanghai reached a boiling point, with a strong desire to perish together with the Japanese. Even the people in the hinterland were all catching up and making material contributions. Who says the Chinese people have no patriotism? But how long has it been, and what is it like now? The first pass in the world has been seized by the enemy, and Tianjin and Beijing are in imminent danger. The enemy's plan to nibble away at our hinterland has begun to be realized. Its severity should be no less than the occupation of Zhabei. But looking back at the people of the country, they are very indifferent to it. Even if there is an expression of concern, it is ultimately powerless. Initially, it was because of the end of the lunar year, with everyone busy with their own affairs. Recently, there has been even more mahjong, poker, and revelry, spending their "happy New Year life." The national spirit of the "September 18th" and "January 28th" incidents cannot be found anywhere. Isn't this a sign of national subjugation? (The following is omitted) Sincerely, Zhuang Sheng</p>
<p>Editor's Note: The phenomenon mentioned in Mr. Zhuang's letter is indeed very serious. Although we dare not call ourselves social pathologists or doctors of the nation, we certainly cannot stand idly by and watch someone die without helping. After our discussion, we have come up with the following diagnosis and prescription.</p>
<p>Diagnosis! "When a tiger is chasing from behind, a coward can leap over a ravine." "When a fire is burning in the hall, even women and children can climb over a wall." This kind of behavior of people wanting to jump is definitely not comparable to the jump of an athlete. The former is the result of a momentary impulse, while the latter is the result of real skill. Because it is a momentary impulse, when there is no tiger chasing or fire burning, they cannot be motivated. Or, because of the deep stimulation, their nerves are abnormal, and they even lose the instinct to cross the threshold. Compared to an athlete with real skills, there is no need to ask. He can continue to jump every day and make endless progress. The blood and energy of our people during the "September 18th" and "January 28th" incidents were indeed the result of a momentary impulse, so it ended afterward. Now, unless more serious situations occur, such as the loss of Nanjing or the occupation of Shanghai, it may not be easy to awaken the dead patriotism. The occupation of Yuguan, this small stimulus, is useless for old guns (Chinese people) who are used to stimulants.</p>
<p>Prescription丨We know the origin of this disease, so we can prescribe the right medicine. Stimulating drugs cannot be used again, because this can destroy their original energy completely. We should cultivate their strength and then train them, so that each of their muscles slowly thickens. "Organizing groups" is the specific medicine for this disease. Therefore, we strongly advocate it in this column, and yesterday in the amateur weekly, we also wrote an article on "How to Organize." Don't laugh at our gourd, which only has this one medicine. We firmly believe that this medicine can indeed enrich every cell in the whole society, until the whole body becomes tall and mighty.</p>
<p>New Developments in Women's Hairdressing Shen Shuxia, Director of the Shanghai Women's Hairdressing Training Institute at No. 198 Ximen Road, has recently developed new plans for the development of women's hairdressing, which are being gradually implemented to facilitate progress. 1) From now on, the institute will recruit new students. 2) The institute will hire one administrator and six or seven technicians for hair salons in this city and other cities, such as Jingjing Beautification. 3) The China Women's Hairdressing Vocational Society has entrusted the institute to recruit free students. 4) Personnel will be sent to Changzhou, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and other places to guide the organization of women's hair salons.</p>

<h3>A Family of Scholars (12th installment)</h3>
<p>— Wang Zhongxian</p>
<p>Youzhong smacked his lips and said, "There's nothing else, I just feel that my conscience always tells me that I'm letting my second brother down."</p>
<p>Ruohua gently pushed him away, turned her lips downward, revealing a look of utter contempt, and said, "Hmph! Good conscience! Only when it comes to your brother do you know about conscience. I think your conscience has long been eaten by the celestial dog! I've been with you for three years, treating you with conscience in everything, and today I wish I could dig out my conscience and show it to you, but in the end, I can't get even a bit of your conscience! Your brother is a human being, and you should treat him with conscience, but I'm not a human being, and you can just dismiss me casually. Go! Go and be filial to your brother! Don't come to recognize me, your unconscionable sister-in-law, in the future!" After Ruohua finished speaking, she forcefully pushed Youzhong away, buried her head in her jade arms, and lay on the box lid, expressing her utter disappointment. Youzhong was stunned for a moment, then slowly walked closer, shook her shoulder, and pleaded with her:</p>
<p>"Sister-in-law, I am very grateful for your kind heart. No one is made of wood or stone, who can be without feeling? However, I just blame myself for meeting you a few years too late, and my second brother took you first. Now he is about to make you his official wife, and you will be a formal couple? If we continue to do this improper behavior, not only will I be letting him down, but you too. He has never treated you wrong, and until now, he is still very affectionate towards you. It doesn't seem like we should do things that would let him down, even if we put aside the conscience issue, for the sake of his reputation, it doesn't seem like it's a good idea, right? He is being detained now, and although his life is not in danger, he is suffering a lot mentally. How can we bear to add to his troubles in the family? I am grateful for your kindness, sister-in-law, and I will repay you in other ways in the future. Please don't make me do things that I would feel guilty about, sister-in-law, please forgive me!"</p>
<p>Ruohua covered her ears, unwilling to listen to his words, but he continued to speak incessantly. She suddenly stood up, her face flushed red, her brows furrowed tightly, her eyes wide open, looking truly frightening. She looked at Youzhong, gritted her teeth, gasped for a moment, and spat out a few "good" words from between her teeth. At this time, they had returned to Youzhong's room. He wanted to escape to the deck, but Ruohua leaned against the door, making it impossible for him to escape. She issued a serious warning:</p>
<p>"I only know today how cruel you are! You used to tempt me all the time, and now you're making fun of me. You must be very proud, thinking that you have my handle for life, and that you can spread my shameful history everywhere in the future. Let me tell you honestly, if a woman gets desperate, she can do anything. I want to avenge today's revenge, and I'll make sure you never have a day to turn yourself around in this life. You keep saying brother, brother, but as long as I spread a few rumors in front of your brother, it will be easy to make your brother not recognize you as a brother. You wait and see my methods!"</p>
<p>These words were spoken with such severity, a complete contrast to her gentle demeanor just now. Youzhong had never seen her so angry before, and today he couldn't help but feel terrified!</p>
<p>She turned around to open the door, wanting to leave, but he quickly went over and grabbed her. She put on airs instead, so he had no choice but to lower his head and plead with her. Finally, she asked with a smile:</p>
<p>"Then you can't say that I'm forcing you to lose your integrity, right?"</p>

<h3>Emil Jannings and His Recent Work "The Way of All Flesh" (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Robert Gao</p>
<p>"The Way of All Flesh" portrays the untamed desires between men and women, interwoven with a realistic life of "egoism." A German man, Wassoff, falls in love with a Russian girl, Anna, desperately seeking to satisfy her desires. Because he is not bourgeois and lacks material possessions, Anna is often unhappy, so he resorts to risky ventures to win the beauty's favor.</p>
<p>Earning money is not easy in a deformed and developed society. Even if it's not difficult, it's not easy to fill Anna's insatiable desires. Only stealing can provide quick and easy satisfaction. For this, Wassoff often enjoys Anna's enchanting eyes and seductive smile, truly intoxicating. However, the law is inescapable. How can Wassoff revel in the gentle embrace forever? Therefore, he can only pursue Anna's revelry in his dreams behind iron bars. As for Anna, a young woman living alone is accustomed to having lovers. New loves surpass old loves, naturally wishing that Wassoff would not be released from prison immediately.</p>
<p>However, desire is the opposite of jealousy. When Wassoff returns after serving his sentence, another murderous drama unfolds. Even though Wassoff's replacement dies, another replacement for Wassoff is born. Anna's residence is never without men, but Wassoff's comings and goings through the prison gates cycle endlessly. This is the tide, this is the "Way of All Flesh"!</p>
<p>"To have peace, there must be no women in the world!" Wassoff says. However, how can the world be without women? Therefore, Wassoff's imprisonment is endless, and the so-called "Way of All Flesh" will never be calm, like waves pushing forward.</p>
<p>"The Way of All Flesh" is developed in this way, satirizing, cursing, and at the same time, objectively depicting this segment of realistic life.</p>
<p>The dialogue throughout the play contains many humorous sentences and many with philosophical meaning. The director is flawless. The female lead, Anna Sten, is also able to develop her talents in the film. The camera angles are excellent, and the sound and lighting are appropriately placed. The productions of the German Ufa company are undeniable in terms of science, and even more rare is the artistic refinement, the outstanding talent. How many things coming out of Hollywood can compare to "The Way of All Flesh"?</p>
<p>It will be screened at the New Light Cinema. I don't mind spending the words to introduce it specifically, doing a voluntary advertisement for the cinema.</p>
<p>In the movie "A Bill of Divorcement," Margaret sees her long-lost husband return, and her daughter Sydney, fearing she will faint, rises to support her.</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3>After Watching "Daybreak"</h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>"Daybreak" is a new production by Lianhua Company, starring Li Lili and Gao Zhanfei. The story is set against the backdrop of the revolution. Li Lili plays a village girl, Lingling, and Gao Zhanfei plays her cousin. In the first half, Lingling's expressions are too contrived. The second half is lively and natural, a great improvement from her performance in "Volcano Blood." Gao Zhanfei's performance is also very good. Lingling, because she was deceived by villains, was sold into a life of prostitution. In this painful environment, living a life that is not human, she feels the pain of the masses because of her personal suffering, and becomes a new revolutionary woman. In the end, she is arrested and executed by shooting! The beautiful Lingling shouts, "The revolution will never die out. When one falls, another will rise!" when she is about to die. These are very valuable words.</p>
<p>Luo Ming, who plays the leader of the youth corps, realizes the mistake of internal strife and the sins of the warlords because of Lingling's incident. He realizes it when Lingling is executed! He kills a warlord and sacrifices himself! The performance is appropriate and completely conveys the character of a patriotic officer. In terms of photography, some shots are not clear enough! However, the scenes of Lingling and her cousin chasing Lingling to the stream to wash her feet are indeed suitable for the conditions of beauty, and the photography is very good.</p>
<p>In short, this film is worth watching. You can see the evils of the city and the pain of the human flesh market. You can get some good lessons.</p>
<h3>Thoughts After Watching Daybreak</h3>
<p>— Yu Hong</p>
<p>In this film, all the evils of society are clearly exposed, and the hideous truth of society is revealed. Here we can see that a farmer with rice paddies and lotus ponds cannot make a living, and a worker who can work hard cannot support himself. The authority of capitalists is enough to dominate the life and death of all factory workers. Under the three words "fear of starvation," how many people's hearts have been destroyed, and how many dark evils have been created. This is truly a true picture of modern society! Lingling struggled from the class engaged in prostitution towards the bright road of "saving the masses" until she reached her final destination. She thought the day had dawned, so she was smiling sweetly when she was executed. But on the way out of the cinema, I kept asking myself, has the day really dawned? Has the day really dawned? And in the end, I felt that the day had not yet dawned. I wonder how many people like Lingling are waiting for daybreak in this darkness! But the day will not dawn!</p>
<h3>Elisa Landi's Illness</h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>Elisa Landi, who became famous for starring in "The Yellow Ticket," recently fell seriously ill. Her new film, "Masquerader," has been suspended for four weeks. United Artists is unable to find a suitable replacement for her.</p>
<h3>Greta Garbo's Marriage Mystery</h3>
<p>— Shi Chun</p>
<p>We all know that Greta Garbo has never been married, but recently a British newspaper suddenly published news that Garbo has been married, which really confused us.</p>
<p>The British newspaper said: "In 1924, Garbo married the famous Swedish director Mauritz Stiller. The wedding was held in Constantinople. The ceremony was very simple and strictly kept secret. Even Garbo and Stiller's closest friends were not notified. Although no one knows about this secret, the matter is real."</p>
<p>Mauritz Stiller had a very high reputation before Garbo appeared on the screen. When Garbo went to Hollywood, she was very embarrassed. Stiller helped her find a job for an audition, and Garbo was able to show her talent. It cannot be said that Garbo's ability to achieve today's honor is not due to Stiller's help. Therefore, it is indeed possible for them to marry. But why keep it a secret? This mystery is very puzzling.</p>
<h3>Jeanne Crain's New Partner</h3>
<p>— Luo Fen</p>
<p>Tyrone Power, Jeanne Crain's old partner, has decided to leave 20th Century Fox. After Power left, Jeanne could not make a forest from one tree, and of course she had to find a replacement for Power's role to fill in.</p>
<p>When the film "Apartment for Peggy Sue" began shooting, Power had already announced his resignation to the company. 20th Century Fox sought the consent of Rory Calhoun and Alexander Kindland, etc., who all expressed their unwillingness to partner with Jeanne. Later, because Power's contract had not expired, he completed the film "Apartment for Peggy Sue." The reason why Rory Calhoun and others were unwilling to partner with Jeanne is not clear to everyone.</p>
<p>Power left, and Jeanne's partner was not resolved for a long time. Finally, they found Henri Garat, the protagonist in Congress Dances. Although Hollywood discussions do not dare to make a judgment, they predict that it will not have the same success as Power. What will happen in the future is still uncertain.</p>
<p>Jeanne and Power's honor in the film industry began with "Seventh Heaven" and ended with "Apartment for Peggy Sue."</p>
<h3>Paramount's Salary Reduction</h3>
<p>— Chao Yu</p>
<p>Paramount's reduction of staff salaries has caused a major storm. More than 30 important staff members have left. Recently, Claudette Colbert, an actress, also canceled her contract on December 31 because she refused to change her salary. Although Paramount tried its best to find a way to continue her contract, it had to reduce her current salary, so they negotiated back and forth, but in the end there was no satisfactory solution.</p>
<h3>Film Novel A Bill of Divorcement (8)</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>This severe, major shock is something everyone would expect.</p>
<p>Sydney thought her mother would faint and rushed to her side. Hillary, however, was so happy that he almost forgot himself. He called out to his beloved.</p>
<p>"Marg! Marg, I'm back. I'm cured! I'm completely healed. Marg! You remember, I was in the garden then, and suddenly I was temporarily confused. In fact, I'm not as crazy as the others in the mental hospital, but I couldn't make them believe it. Marg, you don't recognize me?"</p>
<p>Margaret looked at Sydney suspiciously, "Sydney, he is...?"</p>
<p>Hillary stared at her. "Why don't you say a word to me? People might think you don't want to see me... Are you happy to see me back?"</p>
<p>Margaret was moved. "When I... I'm happy... Poor Hillary!"</p>
<p>"Mother, it doesn't matter, we'll figure it out later." Sydney persuaded, suddenly feeling willing to defend her father. "Yes," Hillary said again, "I'll tell your mother, I'm completely fine. Marg, I'm telling you, I'm cured." It's not good to be too stimulated, just... Ah, my dear Marg, being at home is like being in a palace of peace... Ah... He stretched out his arms and pulled her into his arms.</p>
<p>Seeing them like this made Sydney extremely heartbroken. She didn't want to see it and looked away. Fortunately, Bassett came in to invite them to lunch.</p>
<p>Sydney felt like a heavy burden had been lifted. "Arrange another seat - this is my... This gentleman will also have dinner with us here." "Yes, miss."</p>
<p>Hillary accompanied Margaret into the dining room. During the meal, Sydney went out privately to call Dr. Harold. Just as the phone was disconnected, Gray came in, and she fearfully asked him to sit in the study, saying that she would go and ask Margaret to come out to meet him.</p>
<p>Gray was used to coming and going in this house, but he was strangely formal like a stranger. How could he not be surprised? But he had to follow her words. At that time, Sydney had returned to the dining room, and behind her father's chair, she signaled Margaret to go to the study. Margaret understood and excused herself to go meet Gray.</p>
<p>Gray in the study was anxiously waiting. "Hey, sneaking around, what's the matter?"</p>
<p>Under extreme tension, Margaret told him. At first, he couldn't fully understand what she meant. Suddenly he understood. "Hillary? You said... Oh! Don't be afraid, Margaret. I'll handle him." (To be continued)</p>
