<p>時評</p>
<h3>日本軍閥果能覺醒乎壯</h3>
<p>自九一八禍變爆發以來、我國一貫之錯誤政策、厥爲不能以果斷之態度、毅然立於問之正面、以自力求問題之解决、而惟多方逃避事實、以求一時之苟安、其始也、則信賴國聨、期望所謂國際條約能發揮權威、主持正義、迨依賴國聨之政策失敗、於是生聚敎訓救國等各型各式之主張、又囂然並作、凡此各類救國主張之實質、仍不外乎逃避現實、暗示人民應忍受目前、希冀未來、以求精神上之安慰、此種一貫的心理、九一八以來、已使我民族之精神武裝完全解除、故黑省繼遼吉而陷落、錦州榆關以至最近之熱河、復繼黑省而淪亡、而我舉國上下、仍宴安酖毒、若幕上之燕、不知自危、乃最近胡適氏復以其往昔希冀國聨之目光、移而希冀東京之軍閥、欲求其適可而止、乃曰、「日本人應該醒醒了、」更爲日帝國主義者作周密之打算、曰、一日本人只有一個法子、可以征服中國、即就是懸崖勒馬、澈底的停止侵略中國、反過來征服中國民族的心、」又曰、「只有日本人澈底懺悔侵略中國、是征服中國的唯一的方法、」此種希冀、自仍不外乎卑怯苟安、不敢立於事實之正面、不願以自力自助自救、而其在另一方面之意義、則尤爲日帝國主義者獻策、敎以征服中國民族之法、勸其放棄砲艦政策、而以和平合作之方式、實行「開發中國」一口號、以緊握中國之實質、使中華民族在「貧血症」之狀態下、漸次以即於死亡、全國人民於此種麻醉性靈之論調、都當予以深切之注意、</p>
<p>吾人可以斷言侵略中國者、非全體之日本人、而爲日本之軍閥與資本家、在暴力統治之下、在黷武政策之下、大多數日本人所蒙受之苦痛、正不比我人今日所遭受者爲輕、吾人對於此大多數痛苦顚連輾轉於軍閥政治暴力下之日本大多數人民、固切盼其爲自救計、爲救中國友邦計、爲維護世界和平計、决然奮起、反對日本帝國主義之侵略政策、然而吾人絶不能對彼日本軍閥有所希冀、籲求其「放下屠刀」、籲求其停止侵略之步武、蓋「與虎謀皮、」本已爲常識以下之錯誤、何况日帝國主義者之對華侵略、正由於資本主義爲經濟恐慌所刺激、不得不以「重新分割殖民地」之政策、企圖挽回其崩潰之末刦、則抱此一希冀者、要又爲根本不明世界政治經濟之情勢、在動盪之狂潮中、呈現其「死相」耳、</p>
<p>吾人認爲在當前情勢之下、大多數之日本人固應醒醒、而大多數之中國人、則尤應醒醒、中國人所應覺醒者爲何、即澈底打破依賴心理、澈底打破希冀敵人自悔心理、澈底打破國人苟安心理、惟自力乃能自助、亦惟自力乃能自救、能阻遏日帝國主義者之侵略、并爭取我民族之生存自由者、厥爲動員全國民族、發動民族革命戰爭、除此以外、更無出路、亦即絶無生路、</p>
<p>太平洋代管島問題</p>
<h3>日本對德秘密交涉</h3>
<h3>德政府與國聨共同行動</h3>
<p>（東京）　日外部因南洋羣島問題漸趨嚴重、如處理不得其法、則將引起世界爲敵、故外部命駐德國日使館與德外部接洽、昨駐德代理大使已訪德外部商議該事、德政府謂此案不能單獨處理、將與國聨協力、日雖自願提出相當條件向德討好、然德政府尙未能確實答覆云、（二十六日華聨社電）</p>
<p>（東京）　此間認日本退出國聨後、德國或將正式向日政府要求退還日本委託統治下之舊德屬太平洋諸島、若德國果提要求時、日本將置諸不理云、（二十六日路透電）</p>
<p>今日通告退出國聨</p>
<h3>日本外交策略</h3>
<p>傳係荒木内田商定</p>
<p>（東京）　日外部預定二十七日下午三時以英文電日内瓦國聨秘書長特魯蒙、同時以電報通告駐外日使館對其駐在政府剖明退盟事情、内田外長即在東京召集各國大公使、詳細解决退盟理由與今後之外交政策、求各國諒解、茲錄日外部退盟後之外交策略如次、</p>
<p>（一）遠東和平與中俄美三國有極大關係、退盟後外交以對中俄美三國之政策爲基本、操英·法·德·意以期達到最後目的、</p>
<p>（二）對美、極力懇求新政府放棄史汀生之原則、在遠東須承認日本覇權、不再以爭覇爲基本政策、注重通商利益、施以經濟關係解决日美間之矛盾、</p>
<p>（三）對蘇聨　要求承認「滿洲國」、蘇聨如肯承認日本手創之「滿洲國」、蘇聨如肯承認日本手創之「滿洲國」、日本將與蘇聨簽訂不侵略條約、在目前則以通商互利爲緩和衝突之手段、</p>
<p>（四）對中國、尋機提起直接交涉、目前則施以某種方法促成中國内亂、醖釀新形勢、使中國自感滅亡之危機、答應日本之要求進行中日直接交涉、以　中日滿合作抵抗白色人種爲最後目的、惟暫時仍取沈默態度、</p>
<p>（五）對英、繼續要求日英復盟、以日英同盟舊誼、請英國承認日軍以武力造成之局勢、不阻害日本獨覇亞洲之政策、日則以經濟通商利益與英國簽定相當之新條約、</p>
<p>（六）法國、自九一八事變以來、一貫承認日本在滿之武力行爲、惟望法國能、續對日接近、日本對安南之通商利益將有重新考慮之决心、</p>
<p>（七）其他歐美各國、槪取消極政策、惟對世界和平事業、則仍表示相當參加、</p>
<p>（八）南洋及南美各地、一槪撤換駐在領事、造成更密切之經濟上文化上之新的關係、以期南洋南美民衆能支持並擁護日本之新政策、</p>
<p>（按以上之外交策略、係出諸荒木與内田之間、除其所屬及其一羣痴想能夠實現外、政界方面均抱絶大懷疑云、）（二十六日華聨電）</p>
<h3>美俄復交問題</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）　羅斯福總統語報紙記者、謂彼已與威斯康辛州之共和黨參議員拉法萊脫討論承認蘇聨之問題、按拉氏曾至蘇聨游歷、最近甫歸國、（塔斯二十五日電）世界新聞社東京訊、日外務當局對於美國承認蘇聨事、有如下之觀測、以爲美國在共和黨政府時代之蘇聨承認問題、其意義僅在美國對蘇債權之確保及商業上利益之增進、而朝野議論、亦分贊否兩派、至於最近民主黨執政、對於承認蘇聨、已有急轉直下之勢、其實現僅爲時間問題、而朝野輿論、贊成者已佔優勢、參院議員大多數以爲根據不變更旣存條約之原則、以解决滿洲問題起見、有在遠東覓得一有力同伴與之提携之必要、故其主張承認蘇俄、乃含有政治上的意義也、日外務省認爲對於此種形勢、有警戒之必要、刻正預想各種塲合而考慮對策、</p>

<h3>美國農民的悲哀（紐約通訊）（二月二十日）</h3>
<p>美國農民、似乎已陷於絶境了、美國農民命運、爲歐洲農民所羡慕者、整一百多年、他們佔有一個處女大陸、幾乎到十九世紀末、尙逐漸向太平洋沿岸西移、自由開墾荒地、無所限制、然大投機銀行、工業與鐵道托辣斯之發生、美國却比任何國爲早、這些投機銀行和托辣斯、各方剝削和壓迫農民、抬高工業品價格、以及鐵道運費、所以、在十九世末十餘年間、美國農村常爲政治不滿的根源、</p>
<p>世界大戰後、美國有名的所謂繁榮時代、農民並未沾着潤澤、並未得到走入「資本主義樂園」之路、雖然現代城市資本主義的文明、如機器·汽車·電氣·無線電等、曾廣大侵入農村、而主要農産物價格、差不多總是常常遠低於必需工業品價格、一九二九年經濟恐慌浪潮爆發的時候、美國農民簡直是陷於深淵、不克自拔、美國農民、現在眞有上不站天、下不着地的景象、政府和銀行、保險公司等、因他們無力納稅和還債付息、把他們田地没收充公、拍賣之事、簡直是家常便飯、威徵尼亞州去年十二月間的一天、半小時之内、被拍賣農戶達八百家以上、即居全縣農民五分之一、密西比州去年四月間一天之内、因未納稅崦被拍賣之農戶達四萬家、田地約七百萬英畝、即約當全州所有農地四分之一、農民大衆不但無法賣掉自已出品、且因生産太專門化之故、也不能供應自已本身之需要、南部各州、約全美農地百分之四十、係種植玉蜀黍和棉花、自然不能完全單吃玉蜀黍一種、更不能吃棉花、所收穫玉蜀黍、大半是焚燒了、有的地方大批小孩餓着肚子、别一地方却拿牛奶來餵豬、據官方材料、一九三零年、加州被毁的水菓有一十四萬萬磅、有千噸曾投之於海、</p>
<p>但在這種情景之下、却有大批農民、挨餓受凍、求一飽而不可得、　美政府要人、亦承認此點、不久出版的有名的胡佛調查委員會兩大冊報告書、承認說道、「農産物價格過低、甚至土地良好的小康農戶、殆都難生存」云云、據美政府農業部長報告、一九三一年、農民及其家庭、勤苦所得、僅比其以前所用僱工工錢之一半多些、農民自已田地所入、尙比其僱工還少、而在現在千百萬失業者尋求工作之日、僱農生活如何、可想而知、又據政府一個統計、「僅供給一頓飯、另找若干錢或不找分文、」即可僱得一個人、</p>
<p>在此種情形下、許多農民、情願抛棄自己田地、但無人購買、田地賣價、往往低於建築物所值、換言之、田地是白白贈給人的、前幾年農民尙可逃入城市、但現在城市失業工人、就有一千五百餘萬、單這點就足以嚇退了農民、近十年來、不管美國曾如何「繁榮」離村而全家移居城市的農戶、有一千五百餘萬、即約全體農民四分之一、但現在情形、適爲相反、失業者惶恐萬狀的、由城市逃回農村、找求草屋和食物、一九三一年、美國各州由城市移居農村的人、比由鄉村移居城市者、要多兩倍、據最近戶口調查、一九三零年、全美離開城市的共有六十八萬人、而離村僅三十七萬兩千人、</p>
<p>這樣、農村感覺眞正人口過多之患、財産被拍賣的農民、有的流爲失業、有的去作苦工、在西部各州、流浪各地無家可歸的農民、成千成萬、無家可歸的小孩靑年、在美國尙是一種新現象、此種現象、現今巨大增長、據報章所載、這種流浪兒童已達五十餘萬、雖然農村人口過剩、但同時困貧窮之故、生殖率大减、據胡佛委員會報告、此種情形如繼續下去、美國一二十年後、全體人口、將要大大减少云云、</p>
<p>「生産過剩」丨物價暴跌</p>
<p>什麽使全世界上最富的美國農民到了這步天地呢、資本家答道、是因生産太多、物價暴跌、尤其農民生産棉花·小麥·水菓·牛油·等等太多之故云云、在事實上、近十餘年來、美國主要農産品的生産、增長確大、美國　·阿根廷·加拿大·澳洲·等國播種面積、均比之戰前增加五分之一、加以新式農業機之應用、美國單在世界大戰後五年間、每人平均生産量、大約增了百分之一七、但是由於播種面積之擴充和機器之應用、致使生産「過剩」、並非是因爲餓肚子的人業已减少了、挨餓的人委實多着哩、單單中國、就可吸收一切「剩餘物」、人所共知的、生産「過剩」、只是因爲這種餓肚子的人、無力可購買麵包及肉品罷了、資本主義的鐵則、本是如此、其一切生産機關的工作、並非爲滿足人民的需要、而是爲利潤的、播種面積之擴充與機器之應用、本爲人類的福利、但在資本主義之下、却反變成罪惡了、</p>
<p>此外、少數托辣斯、控制一切工業、可操縱物價以剝削消費者、但這對零散的千百萬農民、却難辦到、他們只無情地相互競爭、一旦恐慌到來、工業家就可馬上縮小生産、解僱工人、然農民自已、却不能解僱自已、因此美國農産物價格、與其他各國一樣、比之工業品價格跌得更猛更烈、籠罩全國的大量失業、更首先反映於農民之命運、喪失美人信用的歐洲、又停止購買美國農産物、結果、主要農産品價格暴跌、而物價之暴跌、又給投機商人、大托辣斯以更深一層剝削農民之機會、經濟恐慌的所有重担、都轉嫁於農民的身上、譬如美國去年春季批發糧價之跌落、不上三分之一（百分之二八）、而農民所得之價、竟跌了三分之二（百分之六三、）（這還是據農業部的官方材料哩、）換言之、一九三二年春一斗麥子、僅值一九二八年三分之一、現在還要更少哩、</p>
<p>結果、美國農産品總值、突形縮少、一九二九年尙約爲一百二十萬萬金元、一九三零年、已跌至九十萬萬金元、一九三一年更跌至七萬萬金元以下、一九三二年竟跌至五萬萬金元、</p>
<p>「捐稅奇重」</p>
<p>捐稅和高利貸、對破産農民之打擊更重、美國各州稅制、主要爲不動産稅、農民即其主要犧牲品、每戶農民現在所納之稅、比世界大戰前要多兩倍半、此尙就之稅、比世界大戰前要多兩倍半、此尙就貨幣計算而言、若以麥棉計、自世界大戰以來、美國農民所納之稅、約增了五倍、這也是根據政府的統計、</p>
<p>在此種情形下、因無力納稅、農民家産往往被充公拍賣、在貧瘠區域、因生産縮小、農民靑年、無法生存、竭力向外逃亡、據胡佛委員會兩卷報告書說道、「所留之一個主人死亡或逃走後、其家産便被充公、……學校因缺乏經費和學生、日趨减少、敎堂已關閉了、全社會生活、日益悲觀、」（未完）</p>

<p>上海時疫醫院醫師周振談</p>
<h3>救護王部眷屬經過</h3>
<p>北方民氣未死</p>
<p>不甘作亡國奴</p>
<p>本埠西藏路上海時疫醫院醫師周振偕助理茅振邦、配藥師李噵卢等三人、於上月二十六日、往海參崴、救護由俄返國來滬之王德林·蘇炳文·馬占山·李杜·等眷屬及其他難民等、周氏沿途救護診治、備極周密、數千男女老幼、得以平安返國、周氏之功甚偉、無恙輪於二十四日抵靑後、周氏另乘他船、先趕程來滬、於前日到埠、大白社記者、昨特往訪周氏於上海時疫醫院、詢以經過、承詳告如下、</p>
<p>北上服務　周氏謂、聞王德林·馬占山·蘇炳文·李杜·等眷屬、由俄境轉道返國後、本院董事長劉鴻生囑派人前往照料救治、余遂同助理茅振邦·及藥師李道忠、於上月十六日、乘政府所派之無恙輪啓程北上、俾沿途診治病狀、盡國民救國之一分責任、二十五日晚船行中途、因地方天氣嚴寒、河結堅氷、船不通行、余同船主等打開氷塊、始於三月一日抵海參崴、承我國駐俄許總領事贊助招待、一切便利不少、</p>
<p>分批登輪　輪船俄國政府、以海參崴爲中立區、故不准我義勇軍經過其區域、而破壞之、故義軍均繞道至新疆返國、三月四日第一批王德林部下之眷屬一百八十八人、抵海參崴登輪、王夫人亦同時到輪、其中實有二十二名爲受傷之義軍、七日下午四時、蘇炳文·馬占山·李杜·等部下之眷屬一千三百十四人、亦由莫斯科分乘火車四十六節到崴、其中有二百十一人、係軍官及義軍、該項被難者、在途計共十八天、食寒交迫、困苦萬狀、有十一人、因在中途下車購食、遂被放落、後有二人趕至、餘均不知下落、其第二批抵崴時、由馬部宣傳隊長任作田等三十餘人、組織輸送隊、隊員均爲年少力壯之士、故眷屬行李五百餘件、全由該隊於極短時間内搬送、組織甚佳、</p>
<p>沿途情形　無恙輪於九日晚十一時啓椗南下、當開船之第一日、二批眷屬、因途中有二日未食粒米、致於午餐時、羣趨搶奪、嗣後行分食、始有秩序、十五日抵大沽口、十六日九時到塘沽、天津各界紛往迎接、并給慰勞食品、蘇馬李茅眷屬及王德林李杜夫人等、均於十時上岸、至津轉平、于學忠等至天津車站歡迎、王德林之眷屬一百五十八人、仍乘原船來滬、十八日下午離開塘沽、十九日至烟台、二十一日晚抵青島、二十三日近膠州灣、青島各界、於二十日晨派員登輪慰勞、每人給予糖果麵包、二十四日晚七時開船、今日（二十六日）下午三時抵埠、</p>
<p>診療狀况　余等此次前往、全爲注意沿途衛生起見、故當下輪之時、有八人患痧症、四人患猩紅熱、共十二人不准登輪、因該項病症、傳染甚易、爲顧全公衆安全、不得不忍痛拒絶、一方面送隔離醫院診治、并請由許領事負責另行遣送回國、余等在船上設一辦事處、除於下午三時至五時定時診治外、并隨時巡察各眷屬狀况、計診治内科一百九十六人、外科一百十三人、眼科九人、共三百十八人、發藥計二千次以上、計死小孩一名、傳猩紅熱者一人、急症二人、所帶往預備六百人之藥品、全已用盡、</p>
<p>此行感想　余此行月餘、目擊被難同胞之困苦情形、而尤以海參崴之義軍不准通過、給予吾等深切之敎訓、我全國上下、自當一致奮起、此次南來之馬部宣傳隊長任作田君、日内仍將北上、參加抗日、中東鐵路之華員、雖在日軍鐵蹄之下、但亦均願乘機脫離返國、故北方民氣、并不消沉、今日抵滬之眷屬、均爲國犧牲者、望各界力爲救濟與援助云云、</p>
<p>陳友仁談</p>
<h3>美國亟應協助中國</h3>
<p>自美國之義務與責任上立論</p>
<p>分爲軍事法律經濟國際四點</p>
<p>前外交部長陳友仁昨日發表談話如下、自國聨未能解决日本在華侵略所起衝突後、世人目光、今已集中於美國之任務、此項任務、係由歷史造成之環境賦予美國、蓋遠東之國際形勢、一部份建立於門戶開放主義與九國公約及非戰公約所築成之基礎上、而此基礎、則以美國爲其主要素、因門戶開放主義、旣由美國政治家演成、而灌入於列强政治思想中、而九國非戰兩公約、又大部份爲美國政治心理所孕育而産生、現日本欲以武力破壞此國際局勢、美國當然有領導諸國加以防止之責、美國應當干涉中日爭執之理由、可歸納爲四種、（一）軍事形勢方面、（二）法律方面、（三）經濟方面、（四）國際方面、</p>
<h3>軍事方面</h3>
<p>首就軍事形勢方面言之、此乃由於日本之滿洲理論而起、日人曾舉三種理由、聲稱滿洲爲其生命線、（一）原料之來源、（二）屏蔽蘇俄勢力之南侵、（三）日本過剩人口之收容地、對於日人第一理由、中國之答語、則日本儘可在滿洲循尋常國際貿易途徑、購致所需一切原料、一如美國與其他國家需要國外原料時之所爲、日人所假託之赤色恐怖、觀於蘇俄實際對滿政策、亦難成爲重大理由、蘇俄自一九一九年與一九二○年宣言之後、不僅在口頭上且在事實上放棄帝俄侵略滿洲領土政策、渠敢言設國民黨之革命領導、弗於一九二七年遲遲其行、則北滿蘇俄一切權利之收歸我有、今日將爲已成之事實、即謂南滿各項權利、設能於一九零五年脫離日人掌握、仍操於帝俄之手、此時當可同樣收回、亦非全無根據之謬想、至收容日本過剩人口一層、按日本移民滿洲企圖、迄今無一成功、顯似彼島國民族、在體質上或心理上有不能永久居住遠離海洋之大陸地方、如滿洲等處之性質、中國他處、或有爲日人所能居住繁殖者、尤其在山東·江·浙·等沿海諸省爲然、顧皆早告人滿之患、雖然他處尙有樂土、在如美國加拿大之西海濱及澳洲之曠土、皆日人所能拓殖地方、惟此等白人土地、非至日本海軍力握有太平洋上覇權、日人不能問津、而欲造成此海軍覇權、尤非先消滅太平洋上美國之海軍力不可、因此理由、加以美國對於人種平等要求、拒絶讓步後、日人愈形憤懣、遂令日人之軍事思想、悉爲日美兩國、勢已無術避免第三次「生死戰」之觀念所支配、日本參謀本部之計劃此戰爭與從事準備也、恰如準備一八九四年至九五年間之第一次對華「生死戰」、與一九零四年至零五年間之第二次對俄「生死戰」、日人對於第二次「生死戰」之主要準備、爲締結英日同盟、今此盟約雖廢、顧仍繼續爲英國决定　日政策之準則、而日人在準備此第三次大戰計劃中、其外交上之艱巨工作、亦端在維持此同盟之精神、藉以阻撓遠東英美海軍結合之任何企嘿、蓋日人對於國際行使制裁與壓力之媒介物、無有更懼於英美海軍之聨合者、此所以日本在尋覓過剩人口收容地之呼聲中、其宣傳家之字典中、未嘗列入澳洲與新西蘭也、雖然、日本在備戰上、尙有一可畏之露骨表示、即爲其目下之征服中國運動、是此項運動、在其有計劃之佔據全滿及對中國政府正式軍隊作眞正敵對行動以侵熱河時、業已開始、中國現已成爲日本參謀本部九一八以來所定征服計劃之目的物與工具、蓋中國之原料與市塲、爲日人决意與另一島國（指英人）爭雄世界所不可少者、且欲使中國永成爲吸收日本工廠出品之市塲起見、必須乘中國尙未工業化、對於一切出産品之足以與日貨競爭者、由日人獨占支配勢力而後可、再爲日本計、已征服之中國、大可用對美作戰之工具、因支配與利用中國之物力與人力、並占有中國各軍事形要地方、在日美戰爭、將有同樣重要故也、</p>
<h3>法律方面</h3>
<p>次就法律方面言之、羅斯福總統曾在就職演說中宣稱、「在世界政策上、余願將此國家奉獻於决心尊重條約義務與神聖的良鄰之政策、」今日本旣在九國公約中與美國及其他簽字國約定尊重中國之領土主權及行政完整、又在非戰公約中與美國及其他簽字國約定不用戰爭、爲國家政策上之工具、此兩約者、俱由於美國之願望與政治手腕所産生、可視爲美國之契約、而日本之違犯兩約情狀、業已成爲對於美國及國聨所代表之其餘文明世界一種不能容忍之暴行、亦已彰明昭著、毋庸詳述、且日本用武力佔領分割中國領土之一大區域、其幅員約近日本本國之三倍、其所居中國人民、亦均等於日本本國戶口之一半、乃又藉口生命線、作爲侵略滿洲之理由、顯一若欲揭示世界日本已用武力（即戰爭）作爲國家政策</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>之工具、以相譏刺者、中國今旣將日本用力佔據滿洲與熱河、造成勢欲運用九國公約與非戰公約之局勢、提請世界公判、其結果在美國方面、爲國家之榮譽與信用計、當有以促令日本决意尊重其條約之義務與神聖、</p>
<h3>經濟方面</h3>
<p>更就經濟方面言之、亦可得前述兩方面之同樣結論、按中國門戶開放主義、業如前述、爲美國之觀念、亦爲美國對於遠東一隅國際安全之貢獻、苟在海約翰時代、其時美國繁榮、猶未致大部份依恃國外輸出、業已有維持此主義之必要、則在今日美國之繁榮與美人之生活標準、已不能僅恃國内之銷費、其機器所産而有賴於外國之銷納、其過剩製造品、勢更不得不維持門戶開放主義、誠如斯言、則中國市場、大可認爲美國機器時代所不可少者、况美國之採取對華維持好感政策、係屬一種「投資」、俟日本在華破壞活動清算之後、中國人民購買力增加之時、美國商人將有巨大收穫、遠非强力壓迫與砲艦政策之效果所可望其項背、以故尤有不能放棄中國市塲之勢、</p>
<h3>國際方面</h3>
<p>再就國際方面言之、試將日本違犯九國公約與非戰公約後美國所負履行兩約内義務與諾言之責任、一加討論、便可明瞭、此時中國縱不欲請美國與日本作戰、而根據此二約、實有權詢問美國、（甲）是否受此兩約條欵與義務之拘束、（乙）倘受拘束則將如何協助中國、使日人遵守條約、今美國除不致牽入戰爭之物質協助外、尙有擁護條約切實干涉中日爭執之權力與資格美人在戰債中、即具有此種權力、此項戰債、不問英法與其他歐洲國家有力支付與否、苟無條件取銷之、則在美國勢將無益而有害、因無條件取銷、旣不能招致美國之繁榮、亦不能恢復世界之經濟、蓋美國與世界同感苦痛之經濟衰落、祇爲改組社會上現有秩序之大革命先兆、昔法蘭西大革命開啓、歷史上新時代卒能獲致個人之政治安全與民族主義之勃興、今方展露於吾人前之革命、則將獲致個人之經濟安全與國家間之國際安全、此種理論、不在本文範圍以内、茲不詳述、但須知吾輩今日幾已踐及世界新秩序之門閥、如欲使此新秩序不流血不藉暴力而實現、則除其他經濟與社會條件外、必須保持全世界普遍之和平、惟是保持世界和平、非減縮軍備不爲功、縱彼所謂精神上之軍縮者、亦能具有同樣重要、而海陸軍備之减縮、實居首要、雖然語及軍縮、除純屬歐洲之困難如安全與地位平等及修正絓域等問題外、設再有世界大國之一如日本者、赤裸裸表現其統治階級、在道德上無異挾持機關槍之野蠻人、則軍縮將永無實行之可能、吾人遍尋古今歷史、從無一大國如此蠻暴、如此不知檢束、如此毫無人獸所由判之責任意識者、是故美國在權利上亦在責任上、當要求英法與美合作、第一協助中國迫令日本遵守九國公約、第二實行普遍减縮軍備、務令减縮之範圍與方法、不僅在歐洲各國與美國問、並可在遠東各邦各民族與日本間、均能獲得國際之安全、即以此舉作爲取銷戰債之交換、完全解除日本軍備、乃文明心理所産生的軍縮制度中之一條件、而爲欲求國家之生活與工作有較高尙組織者所必不可少、比法國之减縮陸軍、與英國之减縮海軍、更爲急要、彼英法之不减縮軍備、固不能有眞正和平之可言、顧此等國家皆眞正現代國家、有廣大之基礎、建於民治與自由之上、其使用偉大威權、完全出以理智、絶不若日人之不知檢束、故通常亦能如美國之可以信任、日本旣藉華府會議之海軍决議、獲得遠東海軍優勢、目下不論英美單獨一國俱已不能在遠東與之啓釁、此種事實、輔以彼眞正日本政府所具之特性、遂令日人敢於撕破美國政治手腕所造成之兩大公約、武力侵佔中國最富饒之區域、開始其國聨諸會員國與之挑釁而不虞懲罰、日本之眞正政府、並非目下以外務省爲發言人之内閣、乃在其參謀本部、吾人讀日本歷史、常以爲一八六七年明治維新業已結束封建時代統治機關之幕府、其實未嘗剷除幕府、僅更易人物、以長薩兩閥代替德川、而移幕府於參謀本部而已、故日本宣傳家所稱之「現代日本、」仍繼續爲此封建機關變相幕府所統治、考之近世史中、更無惡劣之特殊現象有若日本者、嗣此「現代日本」、藉英日同盟之力、一躍而爲世界列强之一、乃復利用此同盟、作爲野心政策之工具、因之擊敗帝俄揷足於中國膏腴之滿洲、更進而併吞朝鮮、設無英國物質與精神上之助、恐日本將難於厠身列强之林、而今日亦不致成爲中國與美國與美國之危險、甚至最後又將成爲英帝國之危險物矣、</p>
<p>基於前述見解、爲美國政府與人民之重要利益計、必須自動積極干涉日本武力侵華所起之衝突、俾第一履行其九國公約與非戰公約内向中國保證之義務、而全其榮譽與信用、第二保其國家之安全與穏固而免日本取得太平洋海軍之優勢、第三回復美國之繁榮、因唯有首由日本有效之軍縮、繼以其他列强之普遍軍縮、保持世界和平、而後美國始有重覩繁榮之可能也、此種改變國家政策方向、美國不難運用戰債以達到目的、蓋當此世界大變時期、戰債問題、不僅爲美政府手中之經濟武器、且可用爲偉大政策之工具、藉以明智的解决、目下各國問之紛擾事件而創造新環境、吾人固知此舉確須涉及美國政策之發展問題、似與華盛頓警告國人勿牽入他國糾紛之狹隘方針相背馳、雖然、設今有一外人（即一中國人）復誦民主黨在威爾遜派領導下偉大之宣言、鄭重申明美國之前途、顯可成爲世界大邦使人類足跡所至之處、莫不被其勢力、俾文明社會不致絶跡於地球、諒亦爲美人之所許可者乎、</p>
<p>臧啓芳在東北協會</p>
<h3>講今後的東北問題</h3>
<p>要自動的戰要積極的戰</p>
<p>和與拖都不是解决辦法</p>
<p>本市東北協會、於前日下午七時、在八仙橋靑年會請臧啓芳講今後的東北問題、其詞錄下、</p>
<p>主席、諸位先生今天兄弟所要講的、仍然是東北問題、以前在此地講過九一八事變後的東北情形、在座諸位、一定有聽過的、講演的稿子、曾在報紙上登過、那天未在塲的、大槪也可以看見、今天講的是今後之東北問題、上次講的時候、東北丢了、熱河還未丢、所以當時的結論、是「已失掉的土地、要永久不承認失掉、繼續鼓動民衆努力鬥爭、未失掉的土地、要拚命抵抗、拚命保守一的兩層意見、今天講話時、</p>
<h3>熱河又丢掉了</h3>
<p>熱河丢掉以後、整個的河北省、有丢掉的危險、察哈爾綏遠兩省、也有丢掉的危險、日本對我國的進攻有兩條路、一個是南下政策、一個是西進政策、南下是取平津、拿下整個的河北省、西進是由熱河先攻多倫、再攻察省的張家口、侵佔察綏、現在日本究竟是南下取河北呢、還是西進取察綏呢、我們固然不敢說定、但是按日本方面在軍事上和外交上的便利來說、均有向西的趨勢、兄弟對此問題、常如此想、容或還有人不以爲然、因爲日本已經佔領榆關熱河、由濼東和古北喜峯等口、進取平津、</p>
<h3>直如探囊取物</h3>
<p>又何必西攻察綏、不過兄弟以爲、日軍將先向西攻取察綏、有三種原因、（一）日人在未攻熱河之先、和已佔熱河之後、屢次聲言、以長城爲界、平津及北寗路、與英國和其他各國、均有商業上利害關係、侵佔察綏、像熱河一樣、國際上無任何反響、進攻平津、是怕惹起國際糾紛的、這是第一點、（二）日軍進攻的策略、是攻那個地方便易、他就攻那個地方、　東平津、現下我方有重兵防守、他們進攻、我們拚命抵抗、他們的犧牲、一定很大、察省方面、我們兵力的配備、不如平津、他們用侵熱的部隊、西攻察綏、犧牲一定很小、（三）日人由熱西侵、假如我方兵力單薄、直是如入無人之境、把察綏拿下以後、用來控制蒙古、對付蘇俄、也很有重要的關係、這是第三點、因此平津兩地、我們固應重視、察省方面、我說</p>
<h3>尤應特别注意</h3>
<p>而以重兵扼守、而且事到如今、不專是守的問了、九一八後、日人的手段、說來是很簡單、就是得寸進寸、得尺進尺、我們國内政治上的紛亂、民衆組織的渙散、日本方面、是觀察很清楚的、所以他們用全力佔據滿洲、更企圖進佔蒙古、滿蒙如入其掌握之中、祗要用三五年的工夫、把滿蒙整理起來、他們覺得世界各國、均將俯首帖耳、誰還敢對抗、甚而更想把整個中國吞併下去、好樹立他們的大亞細亞主義、以達到建國於大陸的目的、並且中國這種七亂八糟的、不堪狀况、他們滿未放在心上、一意的不宣而戰、更不和我們辦什麽交涉、佔領一塊地方、容他一二個月的工夫、整理一下、再攻打我們的另一塊地方、像這樣一而再、再而三、得寸進寸、得尺進尺的辦法、是一貫下來的、現在熱河旣已失陷、我國對於東北問題、究竟應該採取一種什麽辦法、</p>
<h3>說到外交政策</h3>
<p>不外和與戰兩途、國内輿論有主張非戰不可的、日本用不宣而戰的辦法、侵略我們、我們也應當用不宣而戰的方法去反攻、更應當有整個的作戰計劃、不應當局部作戰、他們來打我們、我們戰、不來打我們、我們也要戰、要自動的戰、要積極的戰、政府應該如此主張、如此實行、民衆也應該如此督促、積極援助、但是到了現在、在朝在野的各方面、還有主張和的、他們拿許多成語、許多理由、來說應該和的道理搬出來「臥薪嘗膽·」「十年生聚·十年敎訓·」「物必自腐而後蟲生·」「不先修明内政·不足以言對外、」種種的格言、聽來不是毫無理由、然而依我看來、我們中華民族到到、簡直不配講這些話、因爲現在一般人心、已敗壞到不可收拾的程度、我們必須先對外、才有出路、如果不是這樣、中華民族、很難打開一條出路的、兄弟這話、並不是專爲感情衝動、是由深刻的觀察、得到的一種結論、有些人、他們的道德文章、我們平素都很佩服、但是他們每一發言、總是和戰兩個問題並論、能戰也好、能和也好、」這種話、我們是不能贊同的、現在的時候、</p>
<h3>苟安不能圖存</h3>
<p>若猶認爲「和」是值得考慮的、未免太没出息了、我們國家處此旣不應和、又不能戰的局面、遂取了一個「拖」字、這可以說是一個新發明、由九一一八拖到現在、以後恐怕還要拖下去、眞是除中國之外、其他民族、絶作不出來、言之非常痛心、在這個拖的過程中、有局部的戰、也有局部的和、尤屬奇怪、江橋大戰、錦州正謀妥協、上海大戰、山海關并不出兵、到現在日本佔了熱河、而中日外交的關係、依然存在、像這樣不應和、不能戰、而一味用拖的方法、實在不是一個正當的出路、變成拖的原因、我們可以想出來的、就是全國上下、都犯下二種毛病、（一）是多半只知有小我、不知有大我、殊不知大我不存、小我焉有存在的餘地、若不全國上下打破小我的觀念、以圖大我的存在、仍是先爲己、後爲國、國家絶不會好的、（二）是一般人祇知責人、不知責己、其實自己應該檢閱自己的作爲怎樣、各地人士常批評抵貨如何不力、軍事如何失敗、說起來均是振振有詞、這種態度、就算不對、我希望自有權有位的人起、都應當</p>
<h3>有深刻的覺悟</h3>
<p>只要自己眞幹、不必責人、也不怕旁人對自己有什麽不好、譬如人民不應買日貨、就應當不買日貨、帶兵的人應該和日軍拼命、就和日軍拼命罷了、否則、我說你不幹、你說他不幹、結果大家都没有幹、只有看國難一天加重一天了、國人所以不能打破小我的私見、而且犯了只知責人不能責己的毛病、不是没有原因的、據我看來、全國上下、雖然天天講究國難、而能夠把國難看得異常嚴重、覺着比任何事情都重要的人、實在很少、惟其看國難不如他自己的事情重要、看收復東北、不容易辦到、倒不如先整理内政、才犯了不能打破小我的私見、和只知責人而不責己的毛病、果然大家眞知道、不克恢復東北熱河、讓日本在那裏治理三年五載、整個中國、即可以被日本併吞、大家必能有更深刻的覺悟、鄙見以爲日本拿住東北熱河、不上三五年功夫、</p>
<h3>准可吞併中國</h3>
<p>就經濟上說、由森林礦産交通各方面來看東北的經濟地位、中國那一部份、也比較不過、任舉我國西南·西北·東南·和中部各地、絶没有像東北那樣重要的、照全國說、入口超過出口、東北則出口超過入口、牠佔了全國出口額三分之一、東北素稱地大物博、人口稀少、若容日人用三五年的工夫、用新的方法開發、東北富源、豈止能吞併中國、直可以使世界上所有列强、都俯首聽命、再說我們現下如果不對日抗戰、又誰能保中國不起内戰呢、對日抗戰、實又可以减去内戰的混亂、國人不能把這種道理看得透澈清楚、是怎樣的危險、本月十七日、東北協會打了一國通電、主張兩點、一點是積極反攻熱河、一點是策動東北義勇軍、九一八後、日人到東北的、以爲可將東北的滿地黄金、搬到他們的三島、可是經過一年半後、義勇軍到處破壞、他們不但未能把東北的黄金搬去、還得拿錢出來維持、日本國内經濟狀况之壞、也是受了這個影響、果然我們全國上下、能積極抗戰、並策動東北義勇軍、日本内部的崩潰、</p>
<h3>是可立而待的</h3>
<p>總括起來說、「和」與「拖」都不好使、我們應該堅决的主戰、現在東北協會的工作、是本此種主張、向前積極進行、並請求各界、加以援助、我們自己如此作去、才可以起來督促政府、政府能俯從輿論、領導民衆積極抗戰、才算好政府、民衆眞能從自己作起、然後以全力督促政府、才算好民衆、不然的時候、又怎樣會講到民族復興、今天兄弟所說的話、也許激昻一點、希望各界同胞要比兄弟更慷慨、更熱烈、才好、</p>

<h3>公共租界内公用事業</h3>
<p>上年度之情形</p>
<p>工部局上年度之工作報告、内有關於各項公用事業之情形、茲略述其槪要如次、</p>

<h3>戀愛悲劇</h3>
<p>丨楓涇周西開君來信丨</p>
<p>我是一個年華弱冠的人，在去年就由自由戀愛而訂婚丨初步丨。這時，因一時之性慾衝動，似入五里霧中，而出此舉；但他的環境及一切都非常惡劣，我自與她訂婚之後。，間接直接受到極大之羞辱，已有多次，且她的品性極暴躁，以前我太鹵莽從事，現今我再四考慮，惟有解除婚約，否則，我厡凤生命作爲後盾；對于此事我非常堅决，非解除誓不休！未知記者先生之意若何，希指示光明路途。</p>
<p>答：足下旣「非常堅决」地要與你「因一時性慾衝動」「而訂婚」的愛人「解除婚約。那只有趕快地解决。這種辦法不但於你相家璃即於你的愛人也好。因爲兩個年華弱冠。說白一點。就是兩個「少不更事」的人。合在一塊。第一椿恐怕生活就要發生問題。而且年紀輕輕地就要忙着做人家的父母。那眞是葬送了你們自己一生的前途。不過你若果以「她的品性極暴躁。」做爲你解除婚約的理由。我却要爲某女士抱不平。依我揣測。倒不是她的性情暴躁。而是足下的性情暴躁。因爲你自己已經承認你「太鹵莽從事。」鹵莽的人没有不暴躁的。這是男性最容易發生的毛病。果然。那就屈在你而不在她。足下就成了負心人了。解除婚約在現在社會當然不算什麽一回事。然而男女關係究竟非同泛泛。若僅就一方着想而對於對方不兼籌並顧。也非恕道。足下以爲如何</p>

<h3>上海市十年來醫藥鳥瞰（續）</h3>
<p>— 龐京周</p>
<p>第四章　業務之情形</p>
<p>新醫業務的收入，除外科醫師可以收受一次高價手術費之外，此外各科任憑提高至若何程度，究竟不是一個居積致富的營業。其最大原因，是新醫診病費時間，而專家設備費資本。他如眼鼻泌尿器等科，更無出診的營業，假定新醫連門診統計，每日診病四十號，每一號費時二十分鐘計，共需時八百分鐘，除去路途上往返等等，可算得已經潦草不堪。然而每天的工作，已經在十三小時以上，自早上九時到晚上十時二十分，還没有騰出飲食便溺的工夫出來。平均每一號約費三四元，也不過百餘元，一天的收入，恐怕做三個月，醫師自己便要病了，不比舊醫祇須白紙一張，秃筆一枝，學生二名名，可以日診百號的來得快，然而新醫却常蒙了一個發財的不潔之名，這是很可怪的！</p>
<p>論理開業醫師，逢到病家邀請，不得無故謝絶，然而現在却有幾位有財産的醫師，因爲怕綁票而非有人介紹不出診，在這不安定的上海市，住屋固然要覓具妥保，而生病請醫也得轉輾介紹，未免太苦。然而這是治安問題，去本篇範圍太遠姑且置之不談。還有幾位名醫，標明深夜謝絶，也許是白天診務太忙，不能耐勞，或者是體弱不耐深夜起身的緣故。這種謝絶診務的舉動，頗爲社會人士所不滿，然而也覺責備醫家太嚴了些。有人說：此種辦法都是故意自高聲價，却非下愚所敢武斷，只好問諸幾位深夜謝絶的醫師自己了。其實市内醫院倘然發達些，那麽深夜救急的診務，往往可以由醫院分去一半，而開業醫深夜出診的需要就少了。</p>
<p>貧病不計，已爲醫界診例中的必有條文，在這平民醫藥很困難的上海，未始不是好現象，然而是否眞能不計，却没有方法去證明。而一方面這貧字的界限也太廣泛，假定以醫師自己的生活程度作標準，那是不如他的人民，要居大多數，一位坐高大汽車的醫師，而往一上一下住屋内住四戶人家的地方去出診，乃是夠默想的問題了。普通新醫的習慣，應診並不先收診金，假如臨時自己斟酌减收也，就是個人私德，比了舊時醫界習慣，尤其是舊醫中的名醫，非先收齊了錢不出門，不上車的，已覺和善得多了。但是社會上人却往往原諒那先收齊錢而出門的醫家，而責備看好了病收費的醫家太計較，這個没有别的，一露一藏，一個深沉，一個率直，所取的方式不同，深沉　的究竟巧妙而佔便宜罷了。但是新醫中的名醫，大約因爲限制診務過繁的緣故，也頗取這個先收錢後出門的方法，莫怪社會上愈覺新醫之難請敎了。舊醫中間，海上著名的張氏，至今門診不論貧富，不過酌收數角小洋，貧者且特地退回，他這種辦法，是否可以人人做得到？是否合宜於現在社會？乃是另一句話，然而他那自己儉樸，而替貧民設想的精神，無論如何值得表揚的。</p>
<h3>飲說一</h3>
<p>— 余雲岫</p>
<p>飲之爲病。古今人皆曰成於水。無異義也。然又有宜辨者二。其一爲痰病。其二爲水病也。飲與痰之異。一爲漿液。一爲粘液。前已言之。則似凡病之能産生漿液者。皆可謂之飲病矣。考金匱四飲。其痰飲之候曰。「其人素盛今瘦。水走腸間　瀝瀝有聲。」此則胃擴張及腸擴張病也。而腸中氣體之發生。亦預焉。胃腸中所蓄之水。與其中氣體相間相雜。下行之際。動盪離合而作聲也。然胃腸中之水。有外來者。有由内而生者。千金大五飲丸。五曰流飲。水在腸間。搖動有聲。巢氏病源候論曰。流飲者。由飲水多。水流走腸胃之間。漉漉有聲。據此。則病源千金之流飲。即金匱之痰飲。病源又以爲由飲水多而致然。然則痰飲之水。乃由外而至。非由内而生者矣。其實痰飲之水。亦可由胃腸分泌參加其間。凡急慢性胃腸炎。能分泌漿液及發生氣體者。皆可有瀝瀝水走之聲。但金匱有素盛今瘦之言。知金匱之痰飲屬慢性病。其爲胃擴張下墜。腸擴張下墜等病。無疑也。其原因之大者。則潰瘍性狹窄。及現存之癌結核等爲之梗也。然則素盛今瘦。水走腸問。。瀝瀝有聲。不過諸病中共有之一現象。非一病所專有。而痰飲二字。不能專名一病也明矣。</p>
<p>金匱懸飲之候曰。「飲後水流在脇下。咳唾引痛。」又曰。「脈沈而弦者。懸飲内痛。」病源論懸癖候曰。「癖氣在脇肋之間。弦亘而起。咳唾則引脇下懸痛。」其曰在脇。曰咳唾引痛。皆與懸飲之候同。惟曰癖氣。似與懸飲之水異。然病源論癖候則曰。因飲水漿過多。便令停滯不散。更遇寒氣積聚而成癖。癖者。謂僻側在於兩脇之間。有時而痛是也。據此。則癖即水在脇也。然則病源之懸癖。即懸飲矣。又病源論癖飲候亦曰。「由飲水多。水氣停聚兩脇之間。遇寒氣相搏。則結聚而成塊。謂之癖飲。在脇下。弦畫起。按之則作水聲。」此亦與懸癖相同。又論飲癖候曰。「由飲水過多。在於脇下不散。又遇寒氣相觸而痛。即呼爲飲癖也。其狀脇下弦急。時有水聲。」此與癖飲同。亦即懸癖。亦即懸飲也。約言之。水在脇下。咳唾引痛者。謂之懸飲。其時有弦亘而起者。因謂之懸癖。其時有水聲者。謂之癖飲。或謂之飲癖。四者同一病也。其病之證候。則脇下痛也。弦亘而起。成塊也。有水聲也。其中脇下痛一候。頗與今之濕性肋膜炎相似。然非肋膜炎也。何以知之。肋膜炎不弦亘而起。又按之無水聲。以此知之。又與循環器障碍之胸水相似。然非胸水也。何以知之。胸水亦不弦亘而起。按之亦無水聲也。不但此也。余旣謂飲癖即懸飲矣。而外臺飲僻方二首。其一爲深師附子湯。其又一爲備急枳實白术湯。此二方主治之病候。皆有「心下堅。如盤邊。如旋杯。」之言。夫心下堅如杯如盤。。與脇下弦亘而起成塊。其候相近似。不過部位稍異耳。此候惟胃腸擴張。氣體發生。膨脹過甚者有之。此外則惟有心藏病之鬱血肝而已。肋膜炎與胸水。而心下堅如盤邊如於杯之證候也。此又懸飲非肋膜炎及胸水之一證矣。</p>
<p>然則懸飲之心下堅如杯盤者。果何物呼。曰。此亦非鬱血肝也。何以知之。以鬱血肝亦無按之作水聲故也。因其有按之作水聲一候。故知懸飲之爲病。必爲胃腸擴張。因其有弦亘而起。成塊。或心下堅如杯盤一候。故知懸飲之爲病。於胃腸擴張之外。又有氣體發生甚盛。而擴張之部分。受其膨脹。而作壓迫於周之藏府。故有咳唾引痛或内痛之候也。然則懸飲之爲病。豈有他哉。亦胃腸擴張而已。氣體發生而已。不過其鼓起膨脹之部分。局於接近脇肋之處。或心下。偏僻在一隅。而其氣體發生之程度。較痰飲爲特甚耳。舍此。無他病可以彷彿矣。</p>
<h3>貞操與血統問題</h3>
<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>居今日而言貞操，或不免於開倒車之誚。然千載相沿，宜必有故。若曰理敎之桎梏也，則可强之於一時，而不可行之於永久。彼夫節婦烈女，刳貌毁身以示不二者有之矣！含辛茹苦以撫遺孤者有之矣！於此泯泯衆生之中，又豈無一二聰頴特拔者耶？蓋其中自有不可非難之理在。古人之美貞婦曰；如松柏之貞，如氷霜之潔：貞云潔云，豈空語哉？余深思其故，而後得焉，曰：倫理與生理二者而已。</p>
<p>倫理之說，所云貞也，其言或近於空談，生理之說，所云潔也，其說自歸於實證。由前以言，史籍俱在，由後之說，未之前聞。請略論之。</p>
<p>種族觀念之深，宜莫中國人若矣！蓋其社會之構成，植基於宗法之制度。故排外之念最重，而亂宗之忌尤嚴。一姓有一姓之血統，一人有一人之血統，血統之純雜，基於女子之貞淫，故女子於家庭之中，有操縱種族之關係。</p>
<p>再嫁之女子，其血統至爲不純，蓋其前夫之浸潤，得永久而不泯，一度受胎之後，其夫之浸潤已深，雖再嫁他人，而所生之子，仍有酷似前夫之雅，是在遺傳學上謂之「異父遺傳」又曰「浸潤遺傳」，其血統之不純，可不言而自喩，歐洲白種女子始嫁黑人而繼嫁白人者，往往所生之子女仍含墨種色素，彼其黑白混淆，亦足以證明其遺傳之駁雜，然則古人禁止再醮之義，或即根於生理之觀察歟，至其當否，則有待於治遺傳學者之研究。</p>

<h3>航空救國與醫藥救國（下）</h3>
<p>— 汪企張</p>
<p>這裏我什麽要感想到醫藥身上去呢，因爲九一八，日宼中國以後，國人方才感覺到航空的需要，和飛機的利害，尤其是一二八後，我們淞滬一帶，都眼見身受過了的民衆，但是在九一八以前，並没有個人，張了先覺總理的遺訓招牌，大聲疾呼，喚起大家注意，和趕快努力籌備，使他實現啊，有比較明白的些，僅以爲航空，是便利交通，節省旅客時間的，一種利器，可是大膽乘坐的，究竟還是少數，大都據了一二失事的紀載，還大唱其反對論，政府設航空學校，和闢飛機塲，也從没有人，關心注意，而喚起民衆助力的，萬一有人提倡，一定受衆人的冷眼唾駡。所以不受科學洗禮，和没有世界眼光的民族，最是可憐可恨舊醫們呢，自己他不感覺得嗎，近幾天，爲什麽也大家很起勁的出錢，買外國的飛機呢，我們向來不用飛機，而四五千年來，民族也很發達，很强盛，並不見亡國滅種啊，假使說是玩玩兒的東西，我們早有公輸子削木爲鳶，列子御風而行，還有雷震子有肉翅，飛翔空中，弄玉騎鳳凰上天，都可自詡自誇的先和先覺，睥睨塵寰，何必採取他們器械式的科學結晶，什麽鳥人飛機呢，是吓，倘然没有九一八東北事件，和一二八淞滬事件發生，恐怕大家還在夢中，我知舊醫們，一定不信，世上有空中可以用兵制伏人家的事吧，我爲什麽這般說呢，因爲的的確確，信而有徵的微生物，也可以培養，也可以移殖，也可以做血清，也可以製菌液，染了色，也可在顯微鏡下鑑别地的種類，和看到牠的運動，可說千眞萬確，的了，但是至今舊醫們，還都說没有這回事，都是瞎說，仍主張他的五行六氣，生尅消長，致疾的玄論，有一部懷疑的舊醫們，他偏要曲解他的腐說，而反批評公共衛生的舉動，謂新醫因没有像舊醫的治病能耐，而行此逐末下策，這是世上何等可笑的事啊，就這一點上，我覺得舊醫們，一見了飛機轟炸，便怕，而日常見微生物作祟，倒偏不怕，一見人家有飛機，便勇氣的也想買飛機來抵抗，而見慣的科學進步的醫藥，偏不覺悟而誹謗，而排斥，你看罷，現在科學醫藥的侵略，我們雖不顯受牠飛機那般轟炸得利害，可是外國人，到處横行，東也一個醫院，西也一個學堂，藥房，藥廠，日見增加，器械，藥物，來源不絶，進一步，連衛生行政，也幾乎非有外國人參列操縱不行，一國人民的生命，不都操在外國人手中了嗎，在這種危險情形之下，照我看來，正不輸空中飛機的轟炸，或者還比他利害哩，你要想用舊時的五行六氣草根樹皮來抵抗，無異去請公輸子，列子，弄玉，雷震子，來抵抗飛機，你想有用嗎，倘然明白没用的，何不將贊助航空救國的精神，移向切身的醫藥方面，以子之矛，攻子之盾呢，這裏更希望舊醫們，又不要誤會了我的意思，又要破口駡我外國藥的推銷員，數典忘祖的買國賊啊，須知我所希望的航空救國，不在多買外國飛機，而在自己開廠製造，和培植人才，我也希望的醫藥救國，不在多請外國醫生，多用外國藥品，而在國内多開科學醫校，和多辦科學藥廠，從此願舊醫們的子弟，都進科學醫校讀書，舊醫們的親戚朋友，都做藥師，辦藥廠，開藥房，似乎不必舍己田而耘人之田，又似乎不必航空才可救國，醫藥也很可救國，俗語說，放下屠刀，立地成佛，從今以後，切望立時猛醒，及早回頭，不要像趕買飛機似的今日，雖想亡羊補牢，而苦頭已吃得不小啊。</p>
<h3>科學的達生篇（十）</h3>
<p>— 兪松筠</p>
<p>（二）器械的消毒</p>
<p>器械消毒法，雖有數種，但以煑沸法最爲便捷，在産科上應用的器械，不論用於手術或平産，均以煑沸爲妥，假使没有消毒器械，可用尋常鍋釜磁盆代之。若行煑沸消毒時，大都五分鐘已足，水中可加少許曹達，非但增加消毒力，並有防銹之功。</p>
<p>（三）綳帶材料的消毒</p>
<p>我國舊習，多以汚穢不堪的布片或草紙，用作月經帶或包紮胎兒，實屬恐怖萬分，現在不論新布棉紗，或舊布零片，如能嚴密消毒，則亦未始不可應用。</p>
<p>（四）産婦的消毒</p>
<p>産婦的全身及四肢，均應清潔，並須更換産衣，在分娩開始時期，外陰部以及外陰部的周圍，宜用肥皂，及温水洗滌，再用石炭酸水（百分之二）或來沙耳，（百分之一），施行消毒，尤其是陰毛皺壁外陰部及陰道口等處，更應消毒以期完全清潔，而免病菌輸入陰道之内。</p>
<p>（乙）産婦處置法</p>
<p>（一）産室</p>
<p>分娩開始，在可能範圍之内，將産婦移居在固定的室内，就是所謂産室，據一般舊習慣看來，凡是不願到産科醫院去住院生産的，往往就將尋常臥室，充作産室，但宜擇取那空氣流通，日光充足的房間，雖略狹溢，亦屬無妨，惟須肅靜清潔，最爲緊要，室内温度，亦須適宜，窗戶雖不可緊閉，倘使直接風吹，亦屬大忌。此外如有香氣過烈之物，無用的器具，均以遷置他室爲宜，夜間電燈，光線須亮，室内除接生及産婦親近人等以外，一槪不准入内，以防喧嘩。</p>
<p>疾病常識問答</p>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（四）天痘（俗稱天花）</p>
<p>（問）　小兒往往有出天痘的，他的原因是什麽？</p>
<p>（答）　天痘是一種猛烈的傳染病，他的病原，到現在並没有明瞭。有人說是一種小體。</p>
<p>（問）　這種病傳染之後，隔幾天發病？</p>
<p>（答）　經過十天到十四天的潛伏期，纔發病。</p>
<p>（問）　初發病的時候，是怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）　初發病的時期，是前驅期，約持續三天，先有惡寒，戰慄，高熱，（攝氏三十九度到四十度），劇甚的頭痛和腰痛，起腦症狀（譫語痙攣），消化症狀（嘔吐泄瀉），頻脈（一三○丨一四○）等。有時還有支氣管炎或脾臓肥大，咽峽炎。發病第二天左右，在腹部肱部或股内面，　　等處，見暫時性的麻疹狀或猩紅熱狀小斑點，呌做前驅發疹。</p>
<p>（問）　這種症狀經過之後，便怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）　到第四天體温稍降，入發疹期。</p>
<p>（問）　發疹期的期間有幾天？</p>
<p>（答）　發疹期，持續約十天到十二天。</p>
<p>（問）　發疹的順序和狀態，是怎樣的？</p>
<p>（答）　發病後四天，先在顔面額部生粟粒大的近乎圓形的小紅斑，繼而擴延到軀幹和上下肢：下一天，成爲豌豆大小的丘疹；到第六天成水泡，中央凹窪。到第九天，痘泡完全充盈，成爲膿泡。膿泡，大小也像豌豆，圍繞紅暈，覺疼痛。這樣到發病後第十一天或十二天，　皮，體温渙散退去。皮膚很癢。</p>
<p>（問）　天痘，除了皮膚上發疹之外，别的部分，有什麽病狀？</p>
<p>（答）　皮膚發疹期的前後，粘膜上也起同樣的發疹，尤其容易侵犯鼻腔口腔支氣管，食管，結合膜，間或直腸粘膜和角膜等處，成爲潰瘍。角膜上起了痘瘡，視力因此受損害甚至失明。别的部分，起噴嚏，流涕，流涎，咽痛，泄瀉，嘶嗄，咳嗽等病狀。也有併發腮腺炎，中耳炎，關節炎，喉炎等。</p>
<p>（問）　發疹期後，病人便怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）　發疹期旣經過之後，就是落痂期。在正規的病人，到發病後第十六天左右，起痂皮剝脫，留着暗赤色的斑點，經久纔得消退。</p>
<p>（問）　爲什麽害過天痘的人，要成麻面？</p>
<p>（答）　因爲化膿太深的時候，侵人眞皮内層，落　之後，皮膚表面缺損陷凹之故。</p>
<p>（問）　患天花的人，在什麽情形時候是危險的？</p>
<p>（答）　前驅症狀劇重的或痘瘡融合和出血性的，皮下有紫斑的，都是危險的。</p>
<p>（問）　用什麽方法預防天痘？</p>
<p>（答）　祗有種牛痘，可以預防天痘的。</p>
<p>（問）　種牛痘的方法，是誰發明的？</p>
<p>（答）　是公元一七九六年英國醫生琴納先生發明的。</p>
<p>（問）　小兒在什麽待候應該種牛痘？</p>
<p>（答）　小兒生後三個月就可以接種了。</p>
<p>（問）　每年在什麽季節種牛痘最妥？</p>
<p>（答）　春季最好，秋季次之。</p>
<p>（問）　已經害天痘的，應當怎樣治療？</p>
<p>（答）　祇有對症療治。像治療其他的熱性病一樣：發熱的時候頭部用冰囊　罩，服退熱藥：不安的服鎭靜劑。</p>
<p>（問）　皮膚上需要處置嗎？</p>
<p>（答）　皮膚發癢或疼痛的時候，用冷濕布或淡橄欖油，凡士林等。兩手不可任其抓爬，最好用布包縛手指。</p>
<p>（問）　有些鄉民用紅布包天痘病人，是什麽意思？</p>
<p>（答）　這雖是我國的民間習俗，但却是合乎科學的。因爲現在知道天痘病毒，在紅色光線之下，不易發揮毒性，所以如果把窗戶和病人身體都用紅色遮蔽，可以减輕病人的危險。</p>
<h3>新醫學發達過程中幾個重要的發見和發明（一）</h3>
<p>— 顧壽白</p>
<p>這一篇稿原載開明書店出版的中學生雜誌新年號中因爲内容帶些通俗性質，讀了可以使大家知道科學的醫學的眞價值，丨我們只承認惟有科學的醫學纔是眞正的　學丨並且與申報醫藥週刋的宗旨却也相合；所以特地商得中學生雜誌編緝先生的同意，將牠在本刋中轉載出來。我現在特别在此聲明一下。（壽白註）</p>
<p>現代的醫學，丨在我國看起來是「新醫學，」丨在古代的時候，也曾經受過哲學思想的支配，和今日我國的「舊醫學」一樣；可是後來隨着科學的進步，就脫離了玄虚的理論而趨向實際的考騐，所以纔能發達到今日的地步。現在我將其中最重要的幾個發見和發明介紹一個梗槪，使一般人對於這科學的新醫學可以充分認識，同時並可以感覺到舊醫學的價值如何而設法他牠改良。</p>
<p>（一）全身麻醉法和局部麻痺法</p>
<p>外科手術的最大障碍，就是對於疼痛的恐怖。病人雖也明知所患的疾病非割治不能痊瘉成至少割治後纔可减輕，但是大多數因爲怕痛，終於不敢嘗試：所以麻醉法的發明，在新醫學的發展上實在很有價值。</p>
<p>（Honmor）曾敍述過消劑“Nepentbe止痛的效力：狄奥斯可利德斯（Dioscordos）和普林尼（Ｐliny）兩氏也曾說過曼陀羅（Mandragora）在手術時可以止痛。狄氏說：割治或燒灼時若用曼陀羅根的製劑，能使病人深入睡眠狀態而不覺疼痛；普氏也說：有時只嗅着這藥便要睡眠。</p>
<p>阿普柳斯（Apuleius）說：曼陀羅能使人在睡眠中雖被截斷一肢也不覺得疼痛。阿拉伯的醫書裏，也記載着藥的止痛作用。</p>
<p>歐洲在中世紀的時候，施行手術時曾用防痛的各種製劑，有些是秘方，所以不能指出所含的成分：但是由記錄上可知那主要成分不外乎曼陀羅，鴉片和沃斯（henbanc）</p>
<p>愛丁堡地方的佳民（Benjamin　Be　）氏在一八○一年所發行的第十七版外科書裏，曾說到鴉片的止痛效力最爲顯著。</p>

<h3>梵恩斯鐵爾登將一戰</h3>
<p>美國草地網球會常年大會</p>
<p>通過舉行全美公開大比賽</p>
<p>使業麄與職業得相見機會</p>
<p>日期夏初五月中地點費城</p>
<p>（紐約通訊）理想中世界網球今昔兩大王梵恩斯與鐵爾登之相逢一見高下、今將成爲事實矣、二月十一日之美國草地網球會第五十二屆常年大會中已通過於本年中舉行一全美公開網球大比賽、使業餘與職業兩界、得一相見之機會、梵恩斯爲今日世界業餘網球之大王、鐵爾登執職業網球之牛耳、故此項决議、不啻爲兩大王修一相見之道路也、</p>
<p>公開大比賽日期　公開大比賽由費城區委員動議、常年大會中一致通過、反對者僅美國草地會東部會長華德一人、華德於年會中當選爲新副會長、將來比賽卽在費城舉行、至於日期、八月九月中、則全美網球大會比賽擁擠、十月中則又有西南太平洋錦標賽、故大致將提前於夏初五月中舉行、鐵爾登刻正環游全美、將於六月中赴歐、提前於五月舉行、亦所以與以機會也、</p>
<p>國際間不表贊同　混合業餘與職業選手作公開比賽常年大會此决議案、使世界之網球界相顧而驚、法人操縱之國際草地網球會、首先表示不贊同、英國亦繼之、但據世界網球界數領袖考慮後之意見、謂美國草地網球會自有其舉行此項比賽之權衡、固無須得國際間之贊可也、</p>

<h3>金字大招牌</h3>
<p>— 張芷痕</p>
<p>我國商店中，「信義通商」的爲數固多；但，例外的却不在少數。譬如：你照顧一家商店的時候，可以「上天討價，落地還錢」，有時成交的價目，不及它所討的數目二分之一。買賣雖做成了，可是回顧他家的店堂中，却堂堂皇皇地懸掛善發出金字光彩　「不二價」招牌。我國商店中，另外還懸着一面堂堂皇皇地「童叟無欺」的招牌，但，果然有一個小朋友去照顧他家，不是價錢多討，，就是貨物打折扣，倘若照顧他家的，却是一個鄉下初出來的阿木林，哼！朋友，你須當心他家找出來的銀洋鈔票，有無僞幣。「欺」的本領，高而且妙，可是那「無欺」的招牌，仍舊堂堂皇皇地發出金字的光彩。</p>
<p>「朋友！日本奪去了我們的東北三省，日本奪了我們的熱河，日本還要吞滅我們全中國，我們快要做亡國奴了，我們快快抗日呀，我們要切切實實地抵制日貨呀，我們倘再買日本貨，就是無心肝的禽獸了。」這種激昂慷慨地抵制日貨的聲調，層層疊疊地堆進我們的兩隻耳朶裏，天呀！你老人家給我們的耳朶太生小了，你老瞧！那許許多多抵制日貨的聲浪，怎樣裝得下去？</p>
<p>今天在報上看見三月十三日大阪每日新聞的譯文：「……在華經濟界，可脫離惡劣環境，故近來日貨交易，已漸呈活潑之狀，譬如：紡織……銷路反呈踴躍，棉布……比一月爲多，雜貨……購買力已漸回復……均由悲觀轉而漸次回復原狀之勢。</p>
<p>呀！我迷惑了，我糊塗了，我兩眼昏花，看錯了字吧？不！不！譯筆不忠實吧？手民排錯了字吧？不！不！我清醒了，我明白了，「抵制日貨口號」，不過是商店中的「不二價」「童叟無欺」的金字大招牌罷了。</p>
<h3>觀奕記</h3>
<p>— 石顔也</p>
<p>丨一卒一彈還抵抗丨</p>
<p>昨天在友人那裏，見甲乙兩人戲象棋，我則作壁上觀。甲態度鎭靜，謀而後動，舉手不毁·乙氣充現於面，東動西移而後走一着·看他們的態度，就可以判斷誰强誰弱了·走車跳馬開砲挺卒了一回，甲之軍隊已深入乙方，乙給他傷掉了一車一馬，小亹亦祗剩五分之二，後方之主帥，東奔西走，不安其住，局勢眞到岌岌可危之時了·乙憂急萬分，乃出其智慧，整頓殘餘，沉着應戰，單車匹馬，東禦西敵，更得了衛士之輔佐，居然能支持殘局，没有給甲殺入宫庭·後乙見久守之非計，便改變戰略，以拚死之决心，乘機殺出，一場混戰，殘車匹馬都犪牲了，砲也祇餘一個了·反觀甲方，也遭受大大的損害，車去其一，馬隊全覆没，砲雖没有毁壞，但一時也無用武之地，衛士步兵也傷亡過半·觀雙方陣容，破碎零落，乙已潰不成軍，甲則加以整頓，還可再戰，然而乙却不服輸，鼓其餘勇，驅其殘兵，復起挑釁，再接再厲，前仆後繼，一場血戰之餘，前線祇餘一卒，後方祇剩兩士伴着主帥，其他悉作壯烈的犧牲了·甲方則還有一車一砲一卒，縱觀全局形勢，默察兩方實力，如果罷戰，乙方主帥還可留得一命·那知乙抱死而後已之决心，憤憤對甲說：「吾有一卒兩士，還可以一戰，」於是垂斃之戰局，又入兇猛接觸中，乙之士卒，不移時悉作最後之犧牲，主帥也被擒，而一場爭雄，乃告結束。</p>
<p>甲之戰術精深，固給我大大地佩服，然乙之作戰勇氣，尤令我佩服得五體投地·因爲他具有百折不撓的堅忍心，視死如歸之精神，不到黄河心不死的决心。宣言一卒一彈亦抵抗，就戰到一卒一彈也没有·怎樣說，就怎樣做，眞值得稱他一聲大丈夫！大英雄！更使我感慨不已者，這兩人對奕，完全是一件游戲，而乙竟弄假成眞，實行一卒一彈還戰，自一二八以後，中日之戰，關係我們的存亡生死之事，而軍人反視同兒戲，把一卒一彈亦抵抗一句的壯烈無比的口號，也如孩子唱山歌那般玩·唉！我們的軍人而有乙下棋那般說到做的精神，國家就得救了。</p>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第三回　終負解鈴心登門　錯暗憐丫角願推食分</p>
<p>甘積之在書房裏想心事的時候，他覺着爲顧全自己，和顧全别人起見，只有去告訴楊家的姑娘，請伊以後不必來。不過第一困難問題解决了，第二個問題，就跟着上來，這就是勸伊不必來的話，怎樣說出口呢？難道告訴伊我哥哥不許你來不成？他想着想着，簡直没有辦法，但是無論如何，總不能得罪自己的哥哥，而况自己的生活，也完全靠哥哥來維持，設若把哥哥得罪了，連生活都要發生問題，那又何以處之？在北平城裏，現在是走錯了路，隨便都可以找出幾個失業的人的，有一個位置，有一碗飯吃，現在是十分不容易，豈可輕易把這種地位失掉呢？他如此想着把那不好開口的難關，又復打破覺得總可以設個法子，騙老姑娘一下的，就是將來　伊識破了，那也不要緊，自己把這番苦衷，私自對伊說一說明白就是了，伊若是和我同情的人，我說的話，伊一定諒解的。反過來說，伊要是不能諒解我，也就算不得什麽知己了。主意想定了，心裏比較的坦然些，當天也不敢就到楊家去，怕是讓哥哥看見了，老大不方便。次日起了一個絶早，家中並没有一個人曾起床的，他就悄悄的開了大門向楊家來。楊家雖是比甘家起得早，然而鄉居的人，遲早之間，也不過是一半個鐘頭之差，積之今天起得太早了，楊家的大門，也是雙扉緊閉。自己並没有什麽公開而又重要的事，要和人家去商量，不能好端端的，一早去搥開人家的大門。在門口徘徊兩三個來回，依然没有開門。倒是别家街坊，有開了門的，看到積之就笑着說道：二爺早哇丨積之點着頭，隨便答應了也不早，接着街上挑水夫由門口經過，也笑道：喝丨二爺起來得這樣早丨（二四）</p>
<h3>講話的藝術</h3>
<p>— 煥父</p>
<p>丨上拍下吹而已丨</p>
<p>一個人說話，要面皮厚，口齒清脆，不必管旁人聽了肉麻，身上十萬八千根毫毛，根根豎了起來，只要注意被謟受聽的，聽了窩心，句句打入心坎，起了骨軟體酥的化學作用，纔是講話的藝術，也是處世的藝術。</p>
<p>講話的藝術，倣幾何學的定理，可得着一句話說，便是：「向上用拍，向下用吹。」在處世哲學上演算起來，一些兒不會錯的。怎樣呌做吹？怎樣呌做拍？變化無窮·巧妙萬端，神而明之，存乎其人，斷非在下一枝秃筆所能描寫得出，不過從事實瞧來，也可以報告一下誰不曉得商界上適用「講話的藝術，」其實政界，學界等等，那個不然。何以見得？「大人」「卑職」「栽培」「是」「是」「是，」這是舊日官僚的「講話藝術」，到了目下，「大人」兩字，雖然失蹤，主席，××長等等，却新陳代謝來了。卑職依然卑職，栽培依然要栽培，是是是依然有意想不到的效力。至於學界，是智識階級，尤富於「講話的藝術」的天才，對於校長學董，恭而敬之，極力慕倣卑職見大人的榜樣。在講堂上敎書的時候，書本儘管請它在講臺上睡着休息，嘴裏却不可不滔滔汨汨地大講其山海經，戀愛啦，跳舞啦，電影啦，以及兄弟從前在美國留學時候怎樣的考第一，怎樣的連同級的英國法國日本印度的朋友，都及不來我。高興的時候，不妨來講講自己的一叚戀愛艶史，討論討論失戀的補救秘法，單戀的滋味和痛苦，去打幾支嗎啡針，到一班高徒的心上。當然個個歡迎，人人擁護，飯盌牢，感情好，不是懂得講話丨敎書丨藝術的功效麽？從前有位資格很淺的宿舍管理員，有一天，校長召集全體學生訓話，管理員也來訓話，他道：「兄弟一切禀承校長先生的命令來辦事的，諸君不可違背校長先生的命令啊！」校長先生長，校長先生短，說得聽的人毛髮竦然起來。其實，這一席訓話，一面來戴校長先生的高帽子，一面把校長來做護身符，眞是一舉兩得的「講話藝術」咧。後來，有個學生不願意來倒宿舍裏的痰盂，幾哩咕魯，說出不好聽的話來。那位管理員笑道：「你老兄現在不願意倒痰盂，將來給尊夫人倒馬桶，將奈何！」君房語言妙天下，可謂極「幽默」之能事了。</p>
<p>婦女的樂園</p>
<h3>婦女座右銘</h3>
<p>— 銀楓</p>
<p>有人狠巧妙的以空氣比婦女的領域，但是婦女在此廣漠的範圍内，應該幹什麽事？怎樣幹？應該怎樣做人？應具怎樣才能？應過怎樣生活？這些疑問，很難解答。現在有位研究婦女與家庭的問題而得到成功的人，替我們找出了完善的答案，他所說的話，確是我們婦女的金科玉律，處世的藥石針砭，所以把它摘出幾則，以供我們婦女作爲座右銘。</p>
<p>一個最是伶俐而聰慧的女著作家司克萊奈歸納了世界上近代婦女的許多不同的要求說：「供給我們以工作和從事工作的敎育。我們這樣的要求，不是僅僅爲了我們自身，乃是爲了全人類。」人類社會的最大問題是在使各份子找到適當的地位，這個地位是使每個人都有種相宜的工作，且能使人人安心熱誠於這個地位的工作。伊如能充分的實施伊的天賦，完全的表現伊的才能發展伊的天性；伊才是個最愉快最有用的婦女了。所以女子對於自己的女性本能是應該重視的。</p>
<p>婦女决不是一個模倣者。伊的工作是女性的工作。無目的生存比死了還不如。我們降到這個星球上來應該要做些有價值工作的。腦筋才能而不用，就會消失的。如果一個人停止了向上，他就會退化就要墮落。所以世上除了自己努力向前進取外再没有其他的路了。没有别人能夠代我們做這種工作。懶惰的人是隨處要受到人家輕視的。</p>
<p>選擇終身的伴侣這一回事，其有關我們的幸福和痛苦，比任何别的事都重大。要知婚姻的最高意義，是兩個靈魂的和諧混合，不但爲身體的，而且是精神的和智力的互相吸引。這種婚姻的基礎，一定要建立於男女雙方相敬相愛澈底了解的愛情上面。愛倫凱女士說：「我們女子的心靈上應該烙個火印的標記，這個標記就是說不論那樣的結合，要是缺乏了愛情，結果必是失敗的。」所以女子對於終身伴侣的選擇，有許多的條件要考慮，健康咧，性情咧，志趣咧，體質咧，忍耐心咧，適應力咧，以及其他爲以前人所鮮有注意及到的重要地方。</p>
<p>新娘在未婚前。必需先有一種正當的智識和訓練，使伊到舉行婚禮時知伊所做的是什麽。伊每做一件事必要預先詳細的明白了，不要盲目地瞎做。女子而没有經過實地的訓練，没有學習過自立和自恃，一旦脫離了束縛得到了自由那是極危險了，尤其在父母管束極嚴的情形下的女子</p>
<p>一個女子也許已受了專門的職業，有了一藝之長；但如果伊要做一個賢良的妻子，伊便要另外有一些重要的本領。像一個著用家說：「這種本領不必入了專門學校才學得到，可是它的價值比什麽都寶貴都重要。缺少了這種本領那就是伊的敎育還没有完全。」渥蘭爾把這些本領歸納了起來得到下面的幾條：（一）伊要曉得一百分錢加起來就是一元。（二）伊要懂得怎樣燒飯煮菜，怎樣佈置房室，怎樣製作衣服，怎樣料理病房。（三）伊要勤於閱讀，但不做只知讀死書的書獃子。（四）伊要知道在伊進項範圍中製備服裝，要能夥大大方方的穿賤價的國貨布料製成合式的衣服。（五）伊要知道如何善於自處，不求取悅於男子，求適合於自身。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>法的講法</h3>
<p>— 陳望道</p>
<p>胡適博士總算是與法特别有緣的，他一登台便講法，而今也還在講法。不過當初講的法是文法，是不值五千元的，而今講的法是法律，不久將不止值五千元了。然而這不止值五千元的，可又就是從講那不值五千元的而來，這里隠伏有他的「嘗試成功」的秘訣，值得我們細細的研究。最近將有熱鬧的胡適批判起來，大槪便是爲了想要究明他的這種秘訣的。</p>
<p>回憶他講文法的時候，便有一種離「事實」而講法的傾向。便如他的第一篇文章「寄陳獨秀」，只列一條「五曰，須講文法之結構，」未加說明，固然看不出什麽來，他的第二篇「文學改良芻議」，便已將那傾向顯得明明白白。他在這篇文章中對於文法有特别的强調。他說：「今之作文作詩者，每不講求文法之結構。夫不講文法，是謂「不通」。此理至明，無待詳論。」而其說明不合文法，却並不對照事實說話，只引了一句章太炎的話來擋。說是</p>
<p>「指兄弟以孔懷，稱在位以曾是，」（章太炎語）是其例也。</p>
<p>胡適博士旣然特别看重文法，對於不合文法的例自不會不留心搜羅，而他這里却只用一句章太炎的話來擋。這决不能當他是一時找不着例證，而另外有其重要的原因。這原因便是歡喜頂着大來頭來箝制人，和懶得對照事實說話。</p>
<p>我以爲這兩件是胡適博士幾年來一貫的著作精神，我們不能單單說他說得太簡略，不曾細細分析何處可以把「兄弟」呌做「孔懷」，可以把「在位」說做「曾是」，何處不可以呌，不可以說，輕輕地看過了他。</p>
<p>現在他又用這方法在講法律了。這我可眞替所有的中國人耽心！</p>
<p>我不是無政府黨黨員，固然不忌講法，但據我淺薄的知識，講法律有兩種種講法：一種可以呌做司法的講法。把法律認爲旣成的，再來看某事應該適用那一條法律。如此則惡法也是法，明明是惡法也不能不送人去做惡法的犧牲。還有一種可以呌做立法的講法。即從立法者的見地，看某條某條法該立不該立，立了又該怎樣的適用，纔能有利於社會，有益於人生。如此則惡法便可說不是法，因其無利於社會，無益於人生也。胡適博士到底想取那一種講法呢？</p>
<p>從他講文法的方式看來，他是不會採取第二種講法的。我們曾見他把趙元任博士以爲有八九種用法的「了」字仿照外國文法硬立了一種通則，呌做「虚擬的口氣，」把一切都箍了進去。現在講法律，是不是仍想用這一種「哲學的」方法，「實騐的」方法呢？假如仍然如此，那眞不能不說他是一種「毒於蛇」的毒物了！</p>
<h3>兒戲</h3>
<p>— 豐子愷</p>
<p>樓下忽然起了一片孩子們暴動的聲音。娘高聲喊着：「兩隻雄雞又在鬥了，爸爸快來勸解！」我不及放下手中的報紙，連忙跑下樓來。</p>
<p>原來是兩個男孩在打架：六歲的元草要奪九歲的華瞻的木片頭，華瞻不給，元草哭着用手打他的胸：華瞻也哭着，雙手擎起木片頭，用脚踢元草的腿。</p>
<p>我放下報紙，把身體揷入兩孩子的中間，用兩臂分别抱住了兩孩子，對他們說：「不許打！爲的啥事體？大家講！」元草竭力想擺脫我的臂而向對方攻擊，一面帶哭帶嚷：「他不肯給我木片頭！他不肯給我木片頭！」似乎這就是打人的正當的理由。華瞻究竟比他大了三歲，最初靜伏在我的臂彎裏，表示不抵抗而聽我調解，後來吃着口聲辯：「這些木片頭原是我的！他要奪，我不給，他就打我！」元草用哭聲接着說：「他踢我」！華瞻取直接交涉，對着他說：「你先打」！在旁作壁上觀的寳姊姊發表輿論：「輕句還重句，先打嘸道理」！（註：我們石門灣方言，稱打一下爲打一句。）背後又起一種輿論：「君子開口，小人動手」！我未及下評判，元草已猛力退出我的手臂，突然向對方襲擊。娘見我排解無效，趕過來將元草擒去，抱在懷裏，用話撫慰他。兩孩子分别佔據了兩親的懷裏，暴動方始告終。這時候「五香……豆腐乾」的呌聲在後門外親切地響着，把臉上掛着眼淚的兩孩子一齊從我們的懷裏呌了出去。我拿了報紙重回樓上去的時候，已聽到他們復交後的笑談聲了。</p>
<p>但我到了樓上，並不繼續看報。因爲我看剛才的事件，覺得比看報上的國際紛爭直截明瞭得多。我伏案尋思：</p>
<p>世間人與人的對待，小的是個人對個人，大的是團體對團體。個人對待中最小的是小孩對小孩，團體對待中最大的是國家對國家。在文明的世間，除了最小的和最大的兩極端而外，人對人的交涉，總是用口的說話來講理，而不是身體的武力來相打的。例如要掠奪，也必用巧妙的手段；要侵佔，也必立巧妙的名義；所謂「攻擊」也只是辯論，所謂「打倒」也只是呌喊。故人對人雖懷怨害之心，相見還是點頭握手，敷衍面子。雖然也有用武力的人，但「　子開口，小人動手」，文明世間是不通行用武力的。其中唯有最小的和最大的兩極端不然：小孩對小孩的交涉，可以不講理，不顧面子，而通行用武力來相打：國家對國家的交涉，也可以不講理，不顧面子，而通行用武力來戰爭。戰爭就是大規模的相打。故最大同最小相通似：國家對國家同小孩對小孩一樣。</p>
<p>古人云：「大智若愚，大巧若拙」，「惟上智與下愚不移」。今人也說：「不抵抗就是抵抗」，「吃虧就是便宜」。可知凡物相反對的兩極端相通似，或相等。故國際的事如兒戲，或等於兒戲。</p>
<h3>蕭的賣老</h3>
<p>— 夏丐尊</p>
<p>蕭遊日本，曾寄稿改造雜誌，題曰「恩格爾斯，蕭，列寗」。賣老之態可掬，原文移譯如下，亦社會主義文獻之一也。</p>
<p>迻勿里特利契，恩格爾斯曾與馬克斯合作共産黨宣言，他曾用了馬克斯所遺的材料補紡資本論的後二卷。他在馬克斯被放逐到倫敦的長年月間，把馬克斯從饑餓中救出，且對於馬克斯的孩子們盡了「地上之主」的任務。他自己也曾著過機本書，那些書給予十九世紀的馬克斯主義者以不少的影響。他的筆致比馬克斯的輕妙，有些地方好像是一個幽默家。在社會主義思想史上，他的名氏會和馬克斯不能分離了想吧。</p>
<p>我到了日本，和社會主義者的朋友們談起我曾見過恩格爾斯且曾與他談話的事，這些朋友聽了，爲了對於恩格爾斯的好奇心，眼中都閃鑠着光。這在我原非出於意外的事，可是，我差不多没有可以告訴他們的材料。當我於一八八○年代的初期，以費邊協會創立者之一分子，踏入那行動的社會主義者的生活去的時候，馬克斯已不在這世上了，恩格爾斯還生存，可是他對於這新起的英國的運動，未曾知道。他與馬克斯在距這二十年前，己創立着「第一國際。」一八七一年勞動者階級在巴黎大遭了敗北以後，即「國際」就破滅了。勉强倖存的只有那在德國國會中新抬頭的社會民主黨。馬克斯與恩格爾斯曾勉强以此爲政治上的立塲。過了十年，馬克斯令一個屬於維多利亞時代的世界主義的自由主義者型的英國人，改宗爲馬克斯主義的社會主義者那自稱亨利，美耶斯，漢特曼（Ｈenry　Mayers　Hyndman）的，創立了一個呌做「民主聨盟」的政治團體，這政治團體不久就被稱做「社會民主聨盟。」</p>
<p>不幸，「赤色國際」的創立者，「巴黎公社」的擁護者的馬克斯的名字，在當時的英國是非常恐怕的。漢特曼覺得自己的所謂同盟與馬克斯的名字聨結在一處，於事不利，結果二人之間致於爭鬧，原來二人都是非常容易動怒的。嗣此以後，馬克斯與恩格爾斯都不認漢特曼的運動是代表社會主義的東西。</p>
<p>一八八四年，那和馬克斯毫無因緣，因了極少數的鮑爾喬知識分子之手成就的「費邊協會」創立時，馬克斯已不在世，在恩格爾斯的眼中看來，這新的協會，寧是可笑的東西。幾個少數的呆子氣的趣味儔伴，會被眞正的社會主義眞誠相待，這是恩格爾斯做夢也不會想到的。這樣，恩格爾斯在其自信爲在英國的社會主義的中心的當兒，完全已與英國的運動隔絶了。他的這孤立，因了另一悲劇的原因，更加深化。馬克斯的幼女愛里娜·馬克斯不幸被名呌愛德華·亞培林的無頭漢誘惑了。這男子是徹底的社會主義者，無神論者，進化論首，又是一個　善於捕捉人心的雄辯家，儼然是個不惜以生命去殉自己信仰的男兒，可是一碰到了金錢或婦女，他的良心與自制，就完全没有了。他的債欵與婦女誘惑事件，差不多數也數不盡。這些犧牲者中，有許多常是爲他的雄辯所惑的貧困的勞動者。「國家反宗敎協會」把他逐出，别的任何社會主義的團體也不肯容納他。即在愛里娜，除了恩格爾斯那裏以外，也别無可以庇護他的地方了。於是，這二人努力使恩格爾斯盲目於英國社會主義運動的新發展。他們的這欺瞞行爲，當然含有一種用意，就是：把德國的社會民主黨也同時遮蔽起來，呌恩格爾斯相信自己依然是英國社會主義的最高首領而亞培林是唯一可靠的指導者。</p>
<p>後來，這錯覺因了愛里娜的自殺與亞培林的性格暴露破壞了。但當我與恩格爾斯會見的時候，這錯覺還很强固地作用着。有一次，海特公園舉行五一的勞動者大示威游行，我從費邊協會的講演壇上，完畢了自己的演說下來，一壁觀察羣衆的傾向，隨便到處走着，忽然被一個着鳶色衣服的上了年紀的紳士呌住了。那紳士有着鬚髯，臉上很似高興，他把我的臉孔，當作滑稽的種子似地，凝視了一會，說：「我是誰？你也許不知道吧。」平日遇到人，常有見了面善却無論如何一時記不起名字的，這時我就裝出了這神情鄭重地分辯。他哈哈地笑了說，「我就是勿里特利契·恩格爾斯啊。」自命爲社會主義者而不認識勿里特利契·恩格爾斯，這種鮑爾喬的靑年，在他看來，似乎是世間最可笑的東西了。</p>
<p>不知運動已經把自己丢在寂寞與不知不覺之中，陣陣地往前進行去了，自己還自認爲運動的首領；我心中一壁想着這「老先驅者」的喜劇，一壁就走開了。</p>
<p>快把談話結束吧，恰好這時，在倫敦郊外無名的一隅，生存着一個我所夢想不到的人。我對於那人所知道的，比恩格爾斯關於我的知識更貧弱。恩格爾斯至少知道蕭是費邊社會主義運動的指導者之一，實是一個可笑的傢伙。可是我對於那在哈化特的逋逃者，却甚麽都不曾知道。</p>
<p>那逋逃者名呌維拉琪彌，奥萊諾夫（Ｖladimir　Oulianoff），可是在今日，列寗的稱呼更通行。</p>
<p>我這段談話的敎訓是這樣；丨丨任何指導者都不知誰是自己的後繼者。</p>

<h3>時代與愛的歧路</h3>
<p>— 張貫平</p>
<p>秋英說了一大篇話，海泉也没有留心聽。但是聽見她提及二房東，他就週身起了一陣戰慄，同時想像　樓梯　那種黑晤的情形，實在有些害怕，他只含糊地答應了一句：「容後考慮罷」。</p>
<p>海泉做東請他倆吃的簡單飯菜算吃過了，但看秋英還是十分留戀者不肯立卽離開這家小舘子，儘向着林海泉問長問短。她此刻明白了海泉確是一個純潔的靑年了。</p>
<p>「我們走吧。」</p>
<p>「不。請等一下。林先生這樣急做甚麽？」</p>
<p>她說了後，抱着小孩子走到海泉的面前來。他又聞着了一陣粉香和尿臭的混合的氣味了。</p>
<p>「……林伯伯抱一抱。譏我，……」</p>
<p>她滿臉上堆着笑容，歪頭縮頸的，樣子非常的不大方。海泉没奈何，心裏雖然不情願，但把那個小孩子抱過來了。</p>
<p>「你做甚麽？」</p>
<p>曹世光看見老婆過於不客氣了，有些難爲情，忙叱她。</p>
<p>「我有我的事，要你過問做甚麽？你這個男人，無論甚麽時候都是那樣不講道理，專管人家的閒事，雖然說是夫妻，但也有個境限！女人怎麽能够事事受丈夫的干涉？……」</p>
<p>秋英神氣十足地睨着世光數說了一番。世光只是蹶出嘴唇，很無聊地在剝剩在碟子裏的黑瓜子，一聲不響了。</p>
<p>「對不起林伯伯喲。……我去解個手就來。……」</p>
<p>她對着海泉又滿臉笑容了。她今天對丈夫和海泉是用兩種面孔。她一面向裏面走，一面撩起她的旗袍脚，雙手先揷入裏面的褲腰邊了。海泉立在後面，不免要望了望她，覺得她的舉動何以總是那樣露骨的挑撥的。</p>
<p>海泉最初以爲曹世光家裏最少有兩間房間，也有空着的客鋪。但到他家裏看了後，知道絶望了。他想，到唐耀星庽裏去擠幾晚吧。縱令和他睡在一張床上，也可以。</p>
<p>海泉别了曹世光夫妻，一個人走向學校裏來。他想，到學校裏後，可以看見唐耀星吧。他打算託耀星到鶴子夫人家裏去打聽一下情形。因爲他自從鶴子夫人那裏出來，一直到此刻，還是不斷地思念着她。就連當曹夫人向他作示威運動時，也是思念着他。她總覺得曹夫人不及鶴子夫人的雅潔。</p>

<h3>輔助農村金融問題</h3>
<p>— 仲達</p>
<p>近年以來輔助農業經濟之聲浪，甚囂塵上。無論公私上下，無不以繁榮農村，救濟農業，爲今日發展國民經濟之唯一要素。良以吾國國民經濟窳敗之結癥，卽在於農業經濟之不振，而農業經濟之不振，又在於農村經濟之破産也。</p>
<p>吾國雖未足爲純粹之農業國家，然出産以農業爲主體，自無疑義，最近年來，自事實上觀察，兵災匪禍，水旱天災，接踵而來，其影響於農村經濟，農業生産，自非淺鮮。從統計觀察，則數年來農産品及附産品出口，無不日趨下游，最著名之絲茶棉蛋産品之絶度衰落，即其明證。同時食糧「米麥麫粉」輸入之陡增亦足爲食糧出産短絀之一證。農村破産，農業衰敗，農民生活，因苦當趨極端。賣妻鬻子，自顧不暇，遑論生産。結果農民離村者，有之，田畒荒蕪者有之，其上焉者，至多亦不過維持最低限度之生活。此種情形，已成吾國普　之觀象，吾人固不容爲諱者也。</p>
<p>在救濟農業聲中，論者多集中於農業金融之輔助問題，蓋農村破産，其重要原因，即在農民金融之不能流通。苟能從輔助農民金融着手，使春耕不致失其時，農民得安居樂業，則農業自可發展。此種情形，吾人認爲中肯之論，然而輔助農民金融之方法若何，農業金融之輔助，其先决問題，有一兩端：一爲如何能使資金平穏時流入農村。一爲如何使資金流入農村後。産生相當之效果。</p>
<p>如何方能使資金平穏流入農村，其中有足注意者，三點：（一）須有相當之保障。使資金流入農村，成爲普遍性。資金之流動，幾全以安全爲依歸，在具有危險性之地域或時期中，資金絶非能强迫其流入，幾可以法律繩治者。卽令純粹救濟農業之機關，亦鮮有作「下井救人」之舉，且亦非合於原則之辦法。故唯一方法，卽在於安全的保障。所謂安全保障，卽資金流入農村後，農民絶對維持信用，能安穏的運用，使投資者或熱心農村事業者，不致視爲畏途，借用不致中斷。如此則資金之流入農村，在相當保障下，不僅有繼續投資之可能，抑且可以引起其他熱心救濟農村經濟者之共同參加，而資金之流人農村，亦成爲普遍性。（二）農民須有接收金融救濟之能力。所謂接收金融救濟之能力，卽農民本身信用之充分發展。一方面能吸引資金之流入農村，一方面又能維持資金在農村間之繼續運用。而充分發展農民信用之方法，即爲農民本身有健全之組織。此種組織，卽農村合作社是也。合作社爲農民以自助互助之精神，共同組織之合法團體，彼此以共同之目標，負連帶責任，以共同之信用，向城市中接收資金之流人。對於投資者，能予以充分之保障，如此方足以接受投資者之資金，否則農民單民本身，亦無接收之可能，結果仍等於零。（三）須根據輔助農業金融之正當目標，不使此種事業有中斷之危險。對農村金融之輔助，其目標必須具久遠的眼光，普遍推廣之思想，其辦法固絶不能對農民有絲毫限制之困難，亦不能違反經濟原則而予以特殊之條件。（如反常之低利等）須知輔助農業金融，絶非救濟可比，須根據經濟自然發展之原則進行，方能收實際效果。至於特殊條件，只可贊助於一時，而不能行之永久；只可行之於某一區域，而不能普遍通行；只能一二個團體行之，而不能引起其他機關或投資者之共同參加。其結果，必流入一種崎形的狀態，或虚僞的發展。</p>
<p>至如何使資金流入農村産生相當效果。資金旣有流入農村之可能，農民亦有接受金融輔助之能力，則其所産生之效果如何，爲一絶大問題，不能容吾人忽視者。此種問題，第一必須使農民對於資金的用途，特殊注意，必須用於生産的方面。旣不能用於消費，尤須絶對防止不正當或假借名義之用途。否則資金之流入農村，有害無益，農村之破敗也如故，農民之困苦流離也如故，農業之衰落也亦如故。甚且益趨惡劣。至於規劃用途，則其責任，亦在於合作社之組織健一。第二在輔助農業金融以外，尙須附帶提倡農民識字運動，或其他民衆敎育改良農業運動，其收效必偉。</p>
<p>吾人深覺繁榮農村救濟農業，對於農民。金融上之輔助，自爲主要之圖，而實際上能使資金流入農村，則對於上列數點，不能不充分注意。在農民方面，組織合作社，爲不可或緩之主要工作，然合作社之能否成功，又在於提倡及辦理者之根據目標，認眞組織。必如是，方足以談發展農業也。農村之衰敗，直接固影響於農業經濟，間接即影響於工商經濟，與國民經濟。最近上海銀行，有農業合作貸欵之舉辦，在商業銀行中，實際上曾加農業金融輔助事業者，尙屬破天荒之創舉。其辦法完全以優良全作社爲對象，並能注意於提倡合作組織，及識字敎育運動，目光尤爲遠大，辦法亦極妥痒。將來進行順利，而其他銀行亦能共同參加者，則吾國農村或有繁榮之一日，國民經濟，亦可發展矣。</p>
<h3>銀行的農村放欵</h3>
<p>— 法</p>
<p>查歐美各國銀行事業的發生及發展，無不和國内工商業的發展相連繫，換言之，銀行事業是工商業的補助與調劑，是建立在工商業的基礎之上的。先有發達的工商業，而後才能發展銀行事業，同時銀行事業的發達，也可促進工商業的發展。但是，這在「次殖民的中國」。却是特殊的作用與形態。</p>
<p>近二十年來，中國銀行事業在某種意義上說，可謂是很發達的了。但是它的發達並没有相適應的，與盛的工商業爲基礎，如把全國銀行事業和工商業的發展相比較，很顯然的在此重上銀行事業是反超越之工商業。試看，中國全國除了幾家風雨飄颻中的絲廠和近乎風中殘燭似的紡織廠，還有些什麽。輕工業尙且如此重工業更不用說。當各國正努力於一切生産機械化，電汽化的時候而在中國及勞Tayler先生等來代吾提倡所謂「小手工業」，其可憐的情形，實至痛心</p>
<p>同樣，銀行事業的發展，並不能促進　蔽業的發達。中國銀行事業原作用，可說毫無。除在歐戰期間因特種關係，輕工業略有蓬勃之象外，近來逐年的凋敝，並不能因銀行事業的發達而稍挽頽勢。其間原因固然很複雜，然而銀行和生産事業的没有連繫，實是不可掩飾的事業。</p>
<p>然則中國的銀行是建築在什麽的基礎之上的呢？說來也許有些過分，中國的銀行事業實際上不過是「買辦資本」，「官僚資本」的表現而已。</p>
<p>一切生産事業不能超脫社會關係而發展，中國的銀行之爲買辦資本及官僚資本的集團，也無非是客觀的社會制度所决定。中國的工商，業在帝國主義的，封建殘餘政治的重重壓迫之下，是無法發展的，確非銀行所能盡力。這事實使銀行不得不和生産事業「不發生關係」。但他方面，帝國主義者金融資本的侵入，需要一個中間人，軍閥官僚的經濟剝削，需要個代理；同時因投資生産事業的不安全，過剩的空閑資本需要一個存儲機關。中國的銀行事業，遂在這種基礎之上，生長繁榮起來。（如東三省的官銀號，山西的省銀行等，更是軍閥官僚的直接經營）試看各銀行的主要業務，都無非是「金子生意」，公債·股票·都市地産抵押等的投機事業，及存欵匯兌而已。</p>
<p>無論從那方面說，中國主要的社會形式，除爲國際帝國主義者所經營的沿海各新都市外。，還是農村。主要的生産事業，也還是農業。金融資本本是無孔不入的，中國的銀行之所以忽視農村投資，也是有其客觀的社會關係。本來小農經營和家庭手工業是分不開的，農民的生活一半繫於農業的收入，别一部份還有待於家庭手工業的帮助。但自資本主義的剩餘商品衝破國界，深入中國農村後，中國固有的手工業便如秋風下的落葉，農民的生活卽失去了一部份的憑依。加以賠欵·外債·苛捐雜稅的轉稼，使農民的負担至於不能喘息。再有那不絶的戰爭，及以之所引起的普遍的盜匪與災荒，中國的農村遂眞如胡適这博士所言，成爲五鬼不入的人間地獄。這樣，除了誰有以金錢擲大海的决心以外，還有那家銀行願意投資農村？中國都市上祇見是「人才過剩」而不缺乏，但在農村確是人才空虚。年來高喊「歸農運動」，「到民間去」的人，也都是住在都市的人。但這不能怪誰，亦有其複雜的社會原因。</p>
<p>不過，現在中國的銀行所立脚的基礎，究竟是沙上建屋，加以年來隨世界經濟的不景氣，和全國人民普遍的貧乏影響於官僚資本的减少，所有銀行的原有基礎，也開始有動搖之勢，較有遠見的銀行家，自必焦心於找求别的出路了。恰巧這時候政府對於農村合作提倡得特别努力，而財政恐慌下合作社衬助的經費又成問題，這正是銀行嘗試新出路的最好機會，亦卽以金融資本經過合作社的媒介的深入農村的有利的條件。</p>
<p>報載上海銀行從事農村放欵，且捐巨欵給南京金陵大學，設立農村瓕講座，以便造就農村合作人材。正是銀行事業中一種新的嘗試。我們等着瞧他的後効罷！</p>
<h3>論押租</h3>
<p>— 良明</p>
<p>中國自從秦朝「小民或耕豪民之田，見稅什伍」以來，各時期莫非都是一田非耕者所有，而有田者不耕」的。今日中國各地，大部份的土地，均爲佃農所耕種，租佃制的普遍，實是中國農村金融枯竭，和農業技術衰落的重要原因。</p>
<p>今日的農村生産關係，一方面造成小農經濟的枯竭，一方面又　迫多數貧農入於死亡盜賊之路，所謂押租，便是隨着租佃制度的普遍而來的，含有重大意義的剝削，也就是促進農村金融枯竭與大部份農民流入死訅盜賊之路的利器。</p>
<p>押租在中國各地農村幾捫都存在，所差者名稱的不同而已。譬如在浙江衢州，押租稱爲塡租，在湖南湘潭，稱爲進莊，在上海附近稱爲頂首，在浙江平陽，稱爲禮銀，在河南光山，稱爲禮錢，在湖北當陽，稱爲莊錢，在安徽當塗，稱爲押紹，在湖南常德，稱爲批價，在廣東高羅，稱爲批頭，在安徽濳山，稱爲繫莊，在四川合江，稱爲穏租銀，在安徽安慶，稱爲基脚費，在江蘇江陰，稱爲承種洋錢。押租實數，各地不同，每畝最低自二三元，到最高二三十元不等。如湖北當陽每畝押租爲二十元，湖南各地爲二十三元。海門尙有所謂「重頂輕租」的方法，田租未必輕，而頂首却高到三四十元。</p>
<p>論理，押租存在的理由，無非是地主收租的保障，以防萬一收不到租時，可於押租内扣除。實際上不然，各地地主均有完密的組織，如南通的押佃所，佃農非至萬不得已，决不肯因欠租而離開其土地的。何况各地所謂押租，往往有其名，實際上常多是承租時給予地主的一種「貢稅」，欠租與否，均没有發還的。</p>
<p>所以押租的普遍，别有其意義，簡單些說，不過和其他苛捐雜稅樣的，地主爲增加其本身的收入，而加於農民身上的一種苛徵而已。在農民方面呢？因爲農村經濟，日就崩潰，自耕農没落的日多，亦卽没有土地的農民日多，他們爲求得生存，除少數能幸而厠身於都市的丁廠中外，不得不競向地主租種土地，忍受着非法的苛徵。因之，押租日就普遍，如崑山在一九○五年有押租的佃戶不過佔百分之二五·五，到一九二四年即增至百分之六一·八；南　通在一九○五年僅佔百分之七二·九，到一九二四年却增加到八八·一。</p>
<p>押租的作用，意義至爲嚴重，在今日，中國農民有繳押租能力的實不多，他們因不能繳付押租，遂租不到土地，所留下給他們的路惟有死亡或爲盜賊。反之，即使能羅掘得繳付押租，而耕種的流動資本即被剝奪完盡，爲須農本，不得不淪落而爲高利貨的永世奴隸。東三省的移民，常有因農本不繼，忍痛把墾塾的土地放棄，而流落爲盜匪的，這便是押租的功用</p>
<h3>中國農村的農産賣買</h3>
<p>— 羅復</p>
<p>高利貸資本在中國農村金融中，本來占統治的地位，不過在以前比較自足的地方經濟時代，高利貸資本的活躍機會尙少，但自中國經濟加入世界的漩渦，農産物逐漸商品化以來，農民的生産物及日用品，多需經過交易的關係，高利貸資本在一買一賣之間，更爲增加了氣燄。</p>
<p>在農業經濟時代，家庭手工業和農業本來結成一體，農民以農産的收穫，作爲食物，以手工業産物，作爲衣用，這樣，農家經濟是比較可以自給足的。但自帝國主義的商品，以其價廉物美的緣故，侵入中國農村後，自然把原有的家庭手工業排擠，這並不是農民喜新好奇，而是，洋布比杜布土布，在品質和在價格上都要超優。所以，據各處調查，自足經濟（相對的）已破壞無餘，譬如，四川成都平原的民，食物幾有一半是由購買而來。河北鹽山縣農民食物祗有百分之四四是自産。根據一九二二年至二五年喬啟明氏的　調查，所調查各省農民日用品從市塲購來者佔百分之二四·一·在北滿，農民購入的日用品，約在百分之五十以上。</p>
<p>農民旣須從市塲上購入日用品，自必須出售其農産物以爲收支的抵償。加以帝國主義者原料的需要，食糧的種植不如原料種植的有利，近年來各地農産物種植的變化頗巨，如有許多稻田現在均已改爲棉田，便是顯例。所以，據調查，鹽山農産出售的佔百分之五六，其他各地也均在百分之五十以上。在農産賣買的方式中，高利貸資本乘之而起，農民又受到一層剝削。</p>
<p>中國農民以小農爲多，小農金融的枯竭，使其對於農産買賣不能任自己的意願，孫中山先生也說：中國農民「在米榖没有收成之先，當靑黃不接的時候，急於借錢度日，或者已經收成之後，急於要完糧納租，都不能不賣榖米，用極平的價出賣。商人用極平的價價榖米之後，一轉手之勞，便用極高的價，再行發賣，中間一買一賣，賺得很多的錢，都不關你們農民的事。」實則這種情形已算是好的，大部的農産買賣，都是以預賣或預押的方式行之。</p>
<p>在預賣或預押的方式之下，農民汗血所得的農産，完全不能自主。譬如在陜西，農民在缺乏資本的時候，向棉行糧行，以至地主富農借錢，卽以下屆農産物爲抵押，收穫後卽以農産物折合現金償還，利息算在農産物的時價内。例如借債十六元，當時麥價每石二十元，但照債主計算，以每石十六元爲準，借債人到期須還麥子一石，債主卽於其中取利四元。再如預賣卽在農民需要資本時，以自己田裏的農産物，預賣給豪紳地主或商人，如市價每石麥子二十元，那預賣的空頭麥子，每石不過十二三元，他如廣東等地的靑苗錢，押乾租等，都是高利贷資本以賣賣方式剝削農民。</p>
<p>賣買的方式决不如此的簡單，高利貸資本者還可操縱市價，在農産物價格的上落中，來剝削農民。譬如在東三省的黑龍江流域，「地方錢莊及轉運機關，一方藉官廳威勢，强定低價，收買農民之黄豆；一方自定高價，賣於豆餅廠。所以照石世廉諾夫的估計，除掉運費，稅捐，與其他雜費外，黄豆的市價僅有三分之一，是到農民手裏去的」（見黑龍江流域的農民與地主）。</p>
<p>以農産買賣的關係，來推行高利貸剝削的，不僅富農，地主，商人而已，官僚及軍閥也常是高利貸的推行者。譬如以前東三省，官銀號一方面以奉票向農民强買大豆，他方面又須農民以現金繳稅，奉票毛荒是比什麽都尋常的事，結果農民的大豆不過是一種貢稅。</p>
<p>還有，自從中國農産加入世界商品的漩渦以後，賣買的關係還受着國際資本主義者的支配。譬如東三省大部份的糧産，每年爲日本，英國，美國，丹麥等地方所吸收；糧價完全要靠國際市塲爲轉移，不能自由伸縮。因之國際資本家以金貨壓迫中國商業資本家的銀貨，而銀又壓迫中國農民的銀貨，卽就表面上似很簡單的農産買賣，尙可使中國農民的命運，隸屬於國際資本家的手裏。</p>
<h3>農村合作的障礙物</h3>
<p>— 和</p>
<p>中國農村金融的枯竭，逐漸深刻與普遍化。本來，在今日的土地制度之下，一切的社會條件都是剝奪農民的資本，而驅之於貧乏之境·譬如小農爲要獲得土地耕種，需要購地資本，佃農租耕土地，田租之外，承租之時需先付押租，不得不投入高利貸資本者之門；極高的賦稅及一切苛捐，足使小農隸屬於高利貸資本者；災荒歉收，及兵匪盜賊，更足驅迫小農隸屬於高利貸資本者；甚至婚喪喜慶以及物價變動，都是高利貸資本者的機會。所以如綏遠的農民，「家産農具，牲畜食物，悉毁於匪，雖有土地，亦無法耕種，又不忍坐視田疇荒蕪，不得已羣趨地痞，土棍，官僚，劣紳，及商業資本家行之高利貸下，以圖生存。此等放債者都盤剝重利，殘忍苛酷。四川峨眉山的農民，有百分之二八是依靠高利貸爲生。浙江金華蘭谿等八縣，農民負債之數對於全村農民戶數的百分比，爲百分之五八·八，南通崑山等地，「佃戶之資本，完全屬諸己有者甚少，多借他人之資本，以補不足。崑山及宿縣佃艉，皆借自地主；而在南通者，則多借自富翁，崑山佃戶，由地主方面借債者，殆佔百分之六六·四宿縣佔百分之四一·一。」其他各地農民大多數也都是負債的（見馮和法著「農村社會學大綱，」又名「中國農村社會研究，黎明書局出版）</p>
<p>美國紳士式的研究中國農村問題的「慈善家」們，對於中國的農民的貧乏，常有「貪吃懶做」「好逸惡勞」之責，實則中國農民百計謀生，祗要能苟延殘喘，眞是已無孔不入。譬如華北的農民，「除在豐歲的時候，人人對於飲食總是量腹而食的，甚至在殘冬的時候，有所謂冬伏的習慣，人人不去工作，因之更加减少食物。華東的生活程度輕高，而農民大部也是在飢寒交迫有狀態「，（見Tayler：Ｔhe　Ｓtudyof　Chinese　Rural　Economy）。再如監山的「農家之飯食，常順氣候而變更。……當冬季時，農人大都皆無所工作，故農人皆减作兩餐，以事節儉，而其食料亦最爲經濟，通常以鹻灘中野生之黄菜子，爲一部份之食料，但黄菜子常能致瀉疾，不合乎衛生。……夏季黄菜之綠葉，亦可以佐餐，……就調查者之估計，每年每家平均可消費黄菜子兩石，及黄菜葉約五百斤」（卜凱調查，見農村社會學大綱）。</p>
<p>農民貧乏的弊害，不僅限於其本身，而且影響於社會的各方面，牽涉極廣。貧乏的造因是多方面的，救濟問題自然也很複雜。</p>
<p>一方面爲救濟農村金融的枯竭，他方面爲對抗共黨經濟政策對於農民的蠱惑，農村合作確是個好的辦法。不過，合作主義是個革命的主義，是有其整個的體系及目標的，並不能把它分裂支離。譬如，依照合作主義的理想，它的組織是由下而上，由小而大的人民的自動運動，因爲祇有這樣，合作社的社員才能成爲「自己的主人」才能臻於理想的境地。而在中國，農村合作社祇是居高臨下的一種「慈善性的官家救濟事業，」和眞正的合作，「似乎」有些不符。</p>
<p>據說，中國合作社之辦理得最完善，最有成績，爲南京中央政治學校的消費合作社。但同時，據說該社之所以能有這樣的成績，是因爲有每月數千元的津貼。如其然，則該社之成績自不可抹殺，然語其是否適合眞正合作的原理，那一八四四年羅虚特爾合作先進者在地下有知，恐要嘆氣了。</p>
<p>合作社之存在與發展，是不能超脫當時社會關係的；嚴格地說，在今日中國農村情形下，姑不論敎育情形如何，而經濟情形實也難使「眞正的」農村合作社發展。今日由高而下的合作社，其作用不過給予富農甚至高利貸者以更多的機會，眞正貧乏得没有抵押品的農民，很難佔到合作社的先（指信用合作社）。卽使有，一方面得到合作社的幫助，他方面又受到商人，地主及高利貸的剝削，仍無補於事。據合作社報告，農民向合作社借欵，非用於生産事業，而以還債爲多，便是這種現象。</p>
<p>所以，當前的問題：是爲救濟農村加何普及合作社！爲使合作社起有正當的作用，如何先剷除合作社的阻礙！卽造成農村貧乏的各因素！怎樣的合作社才是符合合作原理，可以之進於合作者理想社會的境地？這是忠誠的連合同志目下所當努力的「當務之急！」</p>
<p>否則，農村合社祇是個空的名稱，在同樣的名稱之下，性質是可以截然不同的。它可爲農民自衛的經濟的團結，但同時也可爲金融資本家甚至高利貸者，以之壟斷農産賣買，及把持金融流通的工具。</p>

<h3>退盟後之外交策略</h3>
<p>（東京）　退出國聨後之日本外交政策、根據自主·公明·及不屈之三大原則、整備對美對俄對華之國際關係、以增進保持遠東和平爲目標、一掃相互間之敵對感情、此爲最注重者、同時謀日本經濟外交之充實、增高日本自主的位置、茲分别詳叙如下、</p>
<p>對「滿洲國」與以充分之援助、俾爲健全之發達、互相提携、謀遠東政策之安定、且整備相互之通商關係、努力日滿經濟權之統制、</p>
<p>對於中國希望到達由中日「滿」三國提携、保障遠東安全確立友好關係之時期、暫時靜觀在中國内政之動向、日本並不自動進行交涉及其他積極的活動即中國仍用以夷制夷之策、自陷謬誤、亦僅好意的促其反省而止、惟仍期待中國政府自動的整備中「滿」關係之保障、而發生中日「滿」三國國交之端緒、</p>
<p>對美方針將一掃被史汀生主義而培植之美國對日嫉視的感情、使其是認日本在遠東主動的位置、爲遠東及太平洋之和平、進行兩國局地的諒解、經濟的有無相通、關於軍縮其他不戰的設施、務必努力認識相互間之特種事態、而達成好意的協力、</p>
<p>對俄外交日俄不可侵條約雖認爲尚未到時、然尊重兩國之經濟提携、使俄「滿」兩國關係公式化、並一掃北滿地方國境之不安、以善隣國資格、俾澈底親善政策、</p>
<p>對英方針尊重英國在東洋之特殊權益、同時使理解日本對「滿洲國」之所信、而維持日英問盟以來之友誼關係、</p>
<p>對法方針與英國同樣、　其支持是認日本在遠東主動的位置、</p>
<p>對國聨及其他對國聨及其他歐洲小國、僅對歐洲的政治問題、表示消極的不滿意而止、對軍縮其他和平事業文化事業等、仍與協力、對於南美及南洋、增員或更迭總領事及領事、期經濟關係及交通之擴充、相互之文化發展等、</p>
<p>南洋委治地問題</p>
<h3>德日短兵相接</h3>
<p>日本採用兩刃政策</p>

<h3>英人眼中之日本崩潰觀</h3>
<p>譯孟却斯德導報導報</p>
<p>日本在一九三一年十二月放棄金本位、自是以來、日圓已經大跌其價、日圓的法定平價、是美金四角九分、現在兌換率祇值二角左右、巳跌去平價的百分之六十、在一九三一年九月時候、日本財政、情形比較的還好、但是因滿洲事變而增加的軍費、以及救濟災禍的補助金、致使預算案不能收支相抵、截至去年六月底止、短絀之欵達五千九百五十萬日圓、政府除直接籌募公債外、又利用儲金局所保管的郵政儲金來簡接籌募、在七月與九月之間、政府的國内公債票、銷數增加八百萬日圓、國庫債券增加五千八百萬日圓、從一九三一年九月底到一九三二年的八月、政府的内債增加四萬六千萬日圓以上、不過在去年九月裏、曾有暫時的低落、政府又向儲金局挪用郵政儲金增加額的大部分、其數從一九三一年九月到一九三二年七月、達三萬萬日圓以上、然而到去年的六月、此欵已屬不敷、政府就在六月、也或是在七月裏、發行國庫債劵以實施簡接膨脹政策、此項債劵由日本銀行和儲金局承　、現在政府已被迫用銀行墊欵一法、以實施直接膨脹政策、郵政儲金額、以前本來增加不絶、在一九三一年六月是二十五萬四千七百萬日圆、到一九三二年七月、已經增加到二十九萬零二百萬、現在因利率低降而减少、利率的减低的目的之一、或許是鼓勵國民認購發行的公債、然而在同時、平常儲蓄銀行裏的存欵、以前從一九三一年六月到一九三二年六月、曾經减少過的、却開始增加起來、假使存欵從郵政局移轉到私立銀行、繼續不止、政府或許深深陷入窮困之境、無論如何、此項財源漸涸日本銀行勢必直接受政府的累、</p>
<p>軍費浩大勢必通貨膨脹</p>
<p>通貨膨脹的事實、官方與新聞界都認以爲眞、此事的實在原因是軍費浩大、不過有一派人根據經濟學和社會學、出來辯護這種意見不在少數、因而膨脹論者的政策、得到强有力的輿論的扶助、其目的在施行一種節制膨脹政策、而取法國一九二三到一九二八年的前例、來做模範、以便效法、政府似確信將來危急　去時、能限制通貨膨脹的時期、且能阻止日圓市價的漲落、因而防免一發不可收拾之弊、其提出的節制手段如下、</p>
<p>一·預算案必須由加稅與緊縮使其收支相抵、</p>
<p>二·國外支出的差額、必須由增加現與不可見的輸出額、及减少輸入額、加以矯正、</p>
<p>然而日本的局勢、比法國昔時要弱得多、所以實際上日本究竟能否學法國或德國的樣、是一個問題、法國是一個富饒之邦、天産旣豐、財源又多、因此幾可閉關自給、日本是一個極貧瘡的國家、天然的財源極少、救濟日本預算案的唯一緊縮政策、便是抑制那超過國家歲出半數的軍費、一九三三到一九三四年的歲出、估計是二十二萬三千五百萬日圓、其中六萬六千二百萬日圓呈海軍經費、四萬七千二百萬日圓　海軍經費、估計的歲入是祗有十三萬三千萬日圓、不敷九萬零九百萬、除這筆短少的欵項外、必须再加上幾種還欵、合計需發行新公債約丨萬萬日圓（約合六千一百萬鎊）、要籌集這筆欵子、擬儘量向國民招募、再由日本銀行認付不足之數、此項整欵當然狠大、因　儲金局已給政府借空、而商辦各銀行又都不甚穏固、所以祗好由日本銀行獨擔了、至於加稅可以加到什麽地步、要看民衆所蓄的納稅能力而定、數目恐怕不會多</p>
<p>眞正是到山窮水盡的地步了、那麽停付外債、或許可以得到一些救濟、但是日本還没有停付過、日本的外債、在一九三二年六月三十日估計是二十一萬九千五百萬日圓、差不多全部要照外幣折算、利息也須照此交付、每年應付的利息、曾經估計、是美金二六·二二五·六七二元、三·七七六·二五九镑、換二○·四五四·九六六法郎、以及二五四·○六六日圓、依十一月的兌率計算、每年利息付欵總額、達二四○·七九一·○○○日間　約是法定平價的兩倍、這是預算案所受的一處重傷、而且日圓的兌換價、理當料其更跌、現在已因預料通貨膨脹要更烈之故、極有跌落的趨勢、日圓愈跌價、所付外債的利息照日圓折算、就愈要增加了、</p>
<p>輸入品與輸出品</p>
<p>增加輸出與减少輸入的政策、在日本比在大多數的他國還更困難、日本的輸入品、其中工業上必需的原料、在總值的百分之五十五與百分之六十之間、這是日本極少的東西、最重要的原料是棉花（占輸入總額的百分之二十五）、羊毛（占百分之五）、油渣餅、木材　煤、以及硫酸錏、同樣重要的食料（肉小麥、米、豆以及糖）、約占輸入總值的百分之十三、而熟貨與半熟貨、約各占百分之十五、機器與車輛、連礦油計算在内、幾占熟貨價值之半（輸入總值的百分之七）、半熟貨包括紙漿、礦砂、生鐵、以及普通金屬、奢侈品以及機製品、可以不用或可以在日本製造的、輸入極少、因此减少輸入額、是一件很困難的事、</p>
<p>在另一方面說、日本的輸出品中、約有百分之九十是熟貨與半熟貨、生絲算在半熟貨内、約占輸出品的三分之一、輸出的全熟貨、主要的是棉織品和絲織品、這兩項在一九三一年占輸出總額的四分之一、生絲織物及其他織品、合計達輸出總額的三分之二以上、要增加輸出品、不問如何努力、在現在的環境之下、必須發展工業、此事早已實行、日圓的跌價、更可借助一臂而分割輸出市塲、似乎也能補助不足、但是因爲工業的發展、那與製造工業大有關係的原料、其輸入額就不免相繼增加、而在實際上、日本輸入品的增加、在今年照日幣計算起來、已經比輸出品多了、這是一半因　輸入品的貨價、必須折成外幣付出的緣故、不過並非盡由於此、因爲生棉的輸入量、在一九三一年上半年、是三十七萬七千米突噸（按一米突噸是一千公斤、合市用制二十担）、到一九三二年的相當時期、就增加到五十六萬零一百米突噸了、（未完）</p>

<h3>核定徵收考成</h3>

<h3>嚴令盤查糧串</h3>
<p>糧串爲徵收憑證、前曾通令各縣長於到任時、切實盤查、乃多視爲具文、以致不肖員書、從中舞弊、侵蝕省稅、經重申前令、限期澈底盤查、如發見虧短、即將經手員書、立予斥革、從嚴追辦、呈報察核、</p>
<h3>限期辦竣義圖</h3>

<h3>頒發由單式樣</h3>
<p>本廳前頒丁米串式、未附易知由單一聨、殊欠完善、茲經補訂由單式樣、分發各縣、飭自本年上忙起、於串票上加刋由單一聨、俾糧戶明悉本人應完糧額、得以事先照數措備、不至爲戶書所欺詐、</p>
<h3>規定丁米收費</h3>
<p>本省於民三規定丁米手數料、爲丁每兩七分、米每石六分、以充戶書薪俸、及編造串票簿冊之用、惟戶書每藉口物價騰貴、入不敷出、發生浮收捲尾、例外需索情弊、經從新規定、自本年上忙起、每丁一兩、加收手數料三分、每米一石、加收四分、即丁每兩米每石、各收手數料一角、嗣後如戶書再有浮收敲詐情事即行從嚴懲辦、</p>

<h3>對俄輸出不發達</h3>
<p>俄貨輸入則甚踴躍</p>
<p>中央社云、中俄復交後、國人對兩國商業關係之發展、殷望甚切、而國人因國貨供給之不足、故均樂購俄貨、以應日用、致俄貨對我輸出、甚爲活躍、且我國商人因需要甚急故多預繳貨欵、至於我國之對俄輸出、據記者向貿易界探得消息、謂其情况與上述適得其反、我國對俄之輸出品、以大豆茶葉爲大宗、大豆佔對俄輸出全數　分之七六、茶葉佔百分之九　、自中俄復交後、我豆茶之輸出雖曾一度興奮、但因俄政府對我出口貨物每多延不付欵、甚至有貨物運出後一年或數月、始行付現者、且其所出非正式收據、不能向銀行貼現、致小商人因資本不能流通、而不願輸出者、故現在對俄之輸出異常不發達云、</p>

<h3>欲蓋彌彰</h3>
<p>— 小夥子</p>
<p>好些人明明自己有了錯誤，自己總不肯承認，而偏生要千方百計。花言巧語，甜蜜蜜的來圖掩飾，而更欲使之變得堂皇正大，千眞萬確表明自己有　由。但是，這理由是造作的，極不自然的，所以他愈想掩飾，則愈充分暴露其卑鄙虚僞的醜態，狐狸尾巴曳盡而不遺，眞是天下最不要臉的東西，丨其實，火紙包火，壓根兒簡直就是些無聊的可憐蟲而已。</p>
<p>比如：明明是侵略，偏說是自衛；明明没有辦法，偏生假裝鎭靜，撤出爛汚「管他娘」；明明没有高射砲，偏生用大號字刋出「擊落敵機」，横竪直接遭殃的是咱們不值錢的生命，和没保障的房産！又如：明知是「謠」，偏要「闢謠」；明爲勒種，偏說「寓禁於徵」；明明濫交與騙錢，偏說以」玉容」而「救國」；明明妬嫉而譭謗，偏說愛護和忠告……總之，在爲者的動機，自以爲是巧，是美，是善，是眞，然而，結果郤不幸得萬分，爲笨，爲拙，爲醜，爲惡，爲胡塗，卑鄙，無聊，不要臉，欲蓋彌彰丨</p>
<p>人，老是這般天生的聰敏，而事實郤偏偏與人倒蛋，而不如人意，這所謂聰明反被聰明誤，天下遺憾掃興的事，没有過於欲蓋彌彰者。</p>

<h3>嘗試</h3>
<p>— 賢</p>
<p>天氣突然奥暖起來，編輯室中浮起了異樣的情形。十點鐘的時候，一切都已完畢，僅等着有否最後的電報。小陳從極深度的近視眼鏡中注意着我，「小弟弟，再來玩，回「把戲吧！」他半打趣的說。</p>
<p>自從那一次「把戲」之後，在工作悠閒時「把戲」兩字常常說笑似的冠在小弟弟身上，而「人小心不小」，更是每次非調侃不可的，雖然我並没有玩過一回「把戲」，却已是像「把戲」畢了業般的，各種「把戲」中都被强逼的參加。何的，遠不成腔的調子，就在小陳說完話後來一個「贊成！擁護！」的雙料舉手。永</p>
<p>這一次興怱怱的到××家裏；小弟弟的名譽已宣告敗産，踏進這樣的塲合却還是第一次。靑年墮落的捷徑，恐怕就從這時間開始吧：這樣有的是燈紅酒綠，軟肉温香，「國難」等等更是火燒上眉毛也不會想起的名字。我雖没有手忙脚措的劉姥姥踏進大觀園舉動，一時也浮上莫明其妙的妄想。默默的坐在一邊，呼着××送上來的香烟，小陳把××推到我面前說：「這是小弟弟，「把戲」却不小哩！」說罷，比在報館裏騙得一枝香烟時還要得意忘形。</p>
<p>「春眠不覺曉，處處聞啼烏…」何像報仇上一次被騙了似的雙方向我進攻。</p>
<p>××這時候用熟習的所謂迷湯，輕輕地拂着我的肩頭說：「小弟弟眞老實。」</p>
<p>我覺得臉上熱辣辣的難受，我想知道自己的臉是否已經「關化」。所幸這裏的空氣是不會長時間的窘迫人的。一付國貨年的特産品放上了紅綠錦被間，他們三個人迅速的分臥兩旁，××拍拍所存的一角地，是擁護參加的意思，我恐怕有更窘的話，從他們得意狂笑聲中吐出來，很從容的坐過去，於是一切伊匪所思的對話，在提倡「國貨」的時候開始。</p>
<p>上海是稱爲不夜天的；在這裏更是不夜天中的不夜天。一個紅的姑娘永遠不會見太陽，這是何等殘忍的刑罰？但在看着貓吃老鼠的玩「把戲」心目中，他們的享樂是化上相當的代價的，這又是何等氣壯理直的回答？上海是終於地獄上面的天堂！</p>
<p>時光像飛一般的過去，小陳何沉醉在肉的享受中，没有歸去的意思。我，存在在他們之間，也没能有根本的需要，或者他們已忘懷了這樣一個不成凑趣的伍者。我偷着一溜烟的跑出來，水電燈的包車正忙着在弄中交往，上海之夜，還在方興未艾的送一羣靑年到地獄裏去。</p>
<p>踏上馬路，黑暗中慘呌的幽靈點綴在霓虹燈下。自己一時無意的玩笑，幾乎掉進了地獄的門首，慢步歸家，我舉首企望上海的天，是否有除去雲霧開朗的一日。</p>
<p>「嘗試」，我在日記中寫上特大的字，將每次翻開來的時候，驚惕自己收回踏在地獄門首的最後一步。</p>
<h3>新軍閥捐欵</h3>
<h3>黃昏</h3>
<p>— 賢</p>
<p>黄昏時候，恁着欄杆，窗外飄着絲絲的雨片，遠處的建築物，像烟霧似的迷茫；而霓虹燈的閃耀，正是都市夜生活的開始。</p>
<p>汽車接着汽車，從遠處駛來，再駛到遠處去：潮潤的馬路上，劃出兩條明顯的車痕，便又被後來的磨滅了。</p>
<p>從電影院吐出來的人羣，被黄包車夫圍上了，他們希冀在這都市壓榨中從享樂者的賞賜下得於明天生命維持，他們却發出不肖的駡聲「猪玀」；忘了亡國恨的紅色人種舉起他們的木棍，表示帝國主義的威嚴，當江北同胞努力向後退的時候，吐出來的人羣丨西裝的，高跟皮鞋的，已踏上他們的蓓兒卡。</p>
<p>酒樓上，充滿了不及歸家去晚饌的寫意朋友，他們不是替東北去的熱血者餞行也不是替受了傷從前線歸來的殘廢者洗塵；他們僅僅爲了「連絡感情」，或者吃飽了飯後，再有重要的工作去幹。侍酒的妓女，對對雙雙在甬　中一陣風似的歡笑進來，因爲不如此，使滿席約人不能努力加餐的。</p>
<p>回力球，跑狗塲，登着巨大的廣告，吸引財迷的夢想者，當了褲子去派一吹頭」，像交易民中一樣，一羣，一堆。對於他們買來的紅綠紙，希望着奬的正是這號碼。一陣騷擾過後，漲紅了臉的，翕開了嘴的，他們的命運，被球與狗支配了。</p>
<p>當然，像燕子窠的地方，也充滿了樂此不倦的嗜好者。老槍的交際員，從啞喉嚨中喊出「女子招待」的招牌，這手腕可以使大批的新會員，加入他們的吹簫會；會務的發達，由於新舊會員的努力，黃昏僅是個固定開會時間，此後延長至天明，全天………</p>
<p>霞飛路上，音樂的聲音盪洩在神秘的空中，黑的咖啡，紅的櫻唇，氣候永遠是春天。電燈換上了暗綠色，各式的皮鞋在地板中打滾，女人，白腿，誘惑，製造社會版的新聞。</p>
<p>黃昏的雨絲飄在楊樹浦一帶，肺結核的女工提着小籃，將自己疲乏的身體，送回家去。這一刹那期閒，當都市的人們尙未興盡歸府的時候，工廠的汽笛，又將她們送進厭榨機。</p>
<p>黃昏時候，恁着欄杆窗外飄着絲絲的雨片，遠處的建築物，像烟霧似的迷茫，而霓虹燈的閃耀，正是都市夜生活的開始。</p>
<h3>奇乎？不奇？</h3>
<p>— 文</p>
<p>清晨披讀本報，見有一則似乎希奇的新聞，那便是交際花薛錦園女士誘姦意大利童子急時夫Ｊoseoh記者先生以事出離奇，特在篇首加按警語；「………惟向來猶僅男性勾引女性，使之爲桑僕之行，馴至近今竟有女性意圖姦淫，而略誘男性之事發生，其尤奇者，厥唯被引誘之男性，爲一歐洲未冠之童子，斯誠所謂海上之大，無奇不有矣。」</p>
<p>誠然，誠然，這事兒頗夠玩味也丨在我們這輩年靑小夥子看來，還只哈哈大笑，感到一種無名的興趣，或者被引起幾縷異樣的性感，其餘也就無所謂了，若是一傳進有清末葉的老前輩的耳鼓裏，使他們知道而今世上竟有這等禽獸之不如的花頭經，說他不會蹬足掀鬚的大駡特駡這社會，這世界，甚至駡及天地，駡盡鬼神，吾不信也。</p>
<p>誠然，誠然，這事兒果夠希奇了！</p>
<p>然而平心而論，却也並不算奇！</p>
<p>我們知道古色斑斑的咱們貴國，自被歐化侵入以後，法敎也就蕩然了，這種肉慾横流的誘姦，乃是必然現象，有閒階級免不了的勾當，就是轉眼看看内地的村女鄉婦，也不是從前那種「長養深閨，足不出戶，」的情况了，而今大多學會了唱幾齣好淫歌，應對得來男人的搭訕了，偷漢子的也就不少吧。</p>
<p>而况是在直承資本主義孵化的上海，又是燈紅酒綠，花簇錦團的東方花都，一般豪富的有閒階級，日夜漫漫的二十四小時，雖云跳出舞塲，還可跑進戲院，下了大菜間，又轉向咖啡座，但長夜慢慢的二十四小時，總還感到難於挨過，若不找些舒神騁懷的玩意兒，也未免有負天賦之厚，于是恭女主的手腕知所施用了，於是急時夫童子音被女人兒誘姦起來了。我想這類勾當在過去還有過多着，只是不曾如此番的宣布於社會，那大槪是被姦的童子没有染患某種隠疾，以故没有引起做家長的去向官庭告發。確實的，我曾看到過女性强姦男性的新聞式的紀述，而且有過許多朋友說，上海果然多着這類的玩意兒，那大祗都是姨太太之類。</p>
<p>還有一層應請善男信女明白的，便是聽聞現在已是男女平等的時代了，關於男性誘姦女性的事實，每日充滿了報紙的篇幅，司空見慣，毫不足奇了。而於女性誘姦男性，却是奇乎奇乎，洋洋盈耳，也未免太脫不盡舊殻了，我想男性旣可誘姦女性，女性也無妨誘姦誘姦男性，這才使得事得其衡，也未始不是謀臻男女平等之一助。</p>
<p>交際花薛錦園有的是自備汽車，更有的是一位素負富名的父親，而所謂意大利童子急時大，也有的是一位總理好爸爸，或者還有天成的一隻美臉孔，彼此皆豪富，無事蕩蕩？童子一時性狂，勾當於焉以成，若是要靠兩手賺飯喫，讀者們，試看這世界那有這等風趣事呵！</p>

<p>學　徒：宋先生，這人要來見你。</p>
<p>宋先生：…………（不語，宋先生的豆腐架子。）</p>
<p>學　徒：你自己去說吧！（向作家說後，退出去了。）</p>
<p>作　家：這位是宋先生了？久仰。</p>
<p>宋先生：唔…。（宋先生在喉底唔了一聲，仍吸烟無語。）</p>
<p>作　家：宋先生：鄙人因爲有一部文稿，特來見見先生，請問可否容納？</p>
<p>宋先生：不要，不要，三句不離老本行的，失戀呀！自殺呀！還有那個要看。</p>
<p>作　家：宋先生，這不是普通一類的，請你先看看，同意的，稿費稍賤也可以。</p>
<p>宋先生：不要！包包花生米的字紙也想來買錢了，開書店的只好飯也不吃了。不要，請你到外面去，此地是辦公室呀！</p>
<p>作　家：宋先生，那末照紙價買與你吧</p>
<p>宋先生：說過不要不要，還嚕囌什麽哩：我又不開花生米店。哼！</p>
<p>作　家：啊………（面色靑白，嘴唇顫動着，慢慢地退至室外。）</p>

<p>店員通訊</p>
<h3>眼看他不久於人世了</h3>
<p>鷄毬廠女工</p>
<p>編者先生：我是滬東某鷄毛廠裏的一個女工，而不是店員，不知你能答覆我的詢問否？我的丈夫，從前他是此地某紗廠引擎間裏的老管（司機）。有一天，因爲大機器上的皮帶斷了，打在他的腿上，好端端把他弄成廢物了。承廠裏先生們的情，除替他醫治之外，現在呌他在煤棧裏發籌，月給工資八元。在上海八塊錢一月，當然是不夠用的；我於是不得不找工作做了。找了很久，好容易找到了；就是我現在工作的那　鷄毛廠，呌我去做揀鷄毛的工作。那時我們的兒子·我們惟一的兒子，還祇有八個月呢。要是他生在富貴之家，怕不還是「風吹肉痛」，寳寳長，寳寳短嗎？但是我因爲要吃飯的緣故，就顧不得了。每天早上，有時他還在做夢的時候，就不得不硬着頭皮，把他弄醒，帶他一同到廠裏。在我工作的時候，權且將我身傍的一方地板作爲他的眠奘樜鷄毛廠裏的情形，先生，或者你不會明瞭罷。這裏滿屋子裏都飛着鷄毛屑，呼吸起來實在難受。我呢，大約因爲年紀大了，泰本也好，所以除了自己一天天覺得黄瘦起來以外，並没有别的現象。但是我們那個小乖乖，却不好了；他現在瘦骨伶仃，竟不像一個人形，天天還要吐上三四口的血，眼見他是不久於人世了。唉！</p>
<p>編者先生，你想想看，我們一家三口：我的丈夫，他因爲替廠主掙錢，雖不致於送命，但也已經是半死了；我的兒子，他非但還没有受到廠家一點好處，有時或者反而受他們的憎惡，但是他終究要爲他們而犧牲的；我呢，眼見這樣一天天黄瘦下去，再加上這種心事，也不問可知了。那末我們是一定犧牲了，但是犧牲的代價，是在那裏呢？（下略）張翠娥謹上</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>編者按：張女士的來信，尤其是末了兩句，「我們是一定犧牲了，但是犧牲的代價在那裏呢？」兩句，讀了實在使人心酸。你看張女士的丈夫，他所以致傷的緣故，並不是出於自己的過失。論理廠方應優給撫慰，至少應照給他原有的工資，一直到他天年的時候。現在廠方僅僅給他八塊錢一月的工資，還不願意他安坐享用，呌他在煤棧裏做發籌的工作；事實上實在一點也没有恩惠之可言。但是張女士口中，還口口聲聲說，「這是承廠裏先生們的情」呢。我眞不解，工人這樣的柔和，爲甚麽一般資本家，還在那裏天天壓迫工人呢？至於張女士的兒子的遭遇，更悽慘了。不要以爲中國有四萬萬人民，死了一個兩個，不成問題；但是我們必得要想一想，中國女工有多少，那一個女工没有兒子，那一個女工的兒女能夠免掉這種悽慘的遭遇。這樣一想，這問題就嚴重化了。在世界各國，尤其是蘇聨，凡是在工廠區域，必定有所謂「托兒所」的設置。凡是工人的兒女，每天可以送去，裏面專門用了許多婦人，招呼他們。到工作完了之後，可以前去領回；並不向工人收取任何費用。我們事事喜歡仿效外國人，尤其是負有「謀工人幸福」的人，爲甚麽對於這種外國人好的樣子，不肯仿行；一味在那兒學他們的「跳舞」與「吃大菜」呢。還是這種爲工人謀幸福的機關，已經停止工作了呢，還是主持這種機關的人，已經死了呢？實在令人不解。</p>

<h3>夢裏光陰（十三續）</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>五逸透出了半個身子，倚在棉枕上，恨詫異地打開了這一個彩盒，瞧裏面却是一大疊字紙，和一封没有信封的長信。</p>
<p>這是林大平所寫的，一起有七頁多。伍逸看完了第一頁，矇鬆着的兩眼，已掙大得像發怒的人一樣，手指微微顫動着；看過第二頁，混身齊抖了……第三頁，第四頁，……到看完，連兩片鮮紅的嘴唇，也變了灰白色，手像才打冰水裏冰過」般的冷。基保有一段：</p>
<p>「現在，我已被强迫的推到了一個地位上，這地位祇有兩條出路：第一，用極無恥的方法，向你乞憐，請你給我留下一些生活的樂趣；第二便是自殺。如其你不能允許我的請求，以至於使我不實行第二條出路的話，那末就請你替我當一個義務的治喪主任：這裏我已把大王公司的總帳，以及我和親友間的銀錢往來的清單，集合了送給你，明天，你便可以開始執行你的職務了！………」</p>
<p>伍逸把這一封信反覆的看了幾遍，眼前仿彿就有一個林大平，握着一柄尖刀，跪在他脚下·像宰牛作前的老牛一般的發出慘不忍聞的哀號來。</p>
<p>「」「哈哈！……哈哈！……」在受了極度的刺激之後，狂笑也是人類的一種很普遍的表示。伍逸一面打桌子上抓過了一支鉛筆來，就在林大平送來的那一個彩盒的裏面絶不思索地寫下了他的答復，一面前仰後合的大笑着。</p>
<p>他所給與林大平的答復是很潦草的二三十個字。</p>

<p>伍逸在大敎育科畢業的當兒，因爲受着中國一般大學生的傳統觀念的影響，已極飢渴地打算出洋去留學，希望在喝了幾年沙濾水，嚼了幾年洋山暮之後，再帶一個鍍金的博士頭銜回來：可是，那時候他家裏所有的錢，委實不夠帮助他達到這個希望，不知不覺就躭擱了五年之多。在這五年裏，第一第二兩年是荒唐時期，他的經濟往往是入不敷出，後來的三年，却因收入的增加，和支出的緊縮，倒使他積聚了五千塊錢。</p>
<p>每逢他發現自己的存欵簿上的數目，有了相當的增加，他總忍不住要把明友們寄給他的歐美各大學的章程取出來，顚顚倒倒的翻看着。然而五千塊錢委實還嫌太少，而上海的一切，又牢牢地把他吸引住了：因此，他總没有出發的决心。</p>

<h3>好萊塢的男女不平等</h3>
<p>— 西容</p>
<p>在好萊塢，男女是不平等的。女子永遠佔便宜，男子永遠吃虧。即以婚姻一事而論，當結婚的時候，男子有不許娶影業以外的女子的不成文法律。犯這條法律，無形之中，一定要受社會的裁制的。有許多男明星，因爲不守這種規律，娶了影界以外的女子，而喪失觀衆的同情以及在同業中的地位。但是女子是絶對自由的。珍娓蓋諾嫁的是一個律師，海綸黛德麗嫁的是地産商人，安娓司登嫁的是德國工程師，桃樂絲麥開嫁的是檢騐官，伊麗荷蘭第嫁的，亦是一位律師。她們的男子，統通不是影業界的人，但她們的聲名地位，並未受什麽影響。</p>
<p>等到結婚之後，女子亦永遠佔便宜，男子亦永遠吃虧。一位男明星娶了一位女明星，女星可以立刻紅起來，男星可以立時没落下去。比方小范朋克娶了瓊克勞馥，瓊的名氣一天一天大起來，小范朋克一天一天低下去，就是一個好榜樣。露絲蔡德頓和賴甫福勃斯亦是如此。當他們未結婚之前，賴甫的名氣很大，露絲還是一位未出道的女演員。賴甫常提拔她，後來露絲成名了，他們亦就離婚了。蓓蓓拉斯丹薇未和佛蘭克費結婚之前，亦是没有什麽名氣的女演員，但是一結婚，佛蘭克費的名氣，就漸漸不響亮了。統計好來塢一切同業中男女結婚的明星們，幾乎没有一位男明星，能於婚後保持他原有的地位的。</p>
<p>再論到離婚一事，男子更不是女子的對手了。女明星離婚的，可以於金錢上名譽上毫無損失，並且可以在報紙上，廣事宣傳。而男子和女子的離婚，尤其是和影界以外的女子爲甚，非但經濟上受莫大之損失，並且有抬致社會厭惡的危險。倘使那女的，是一位大明星，那個男的和他離婚，那同業中人以及普通社會，都會將所有的不是，統通歸罪於那男的。安哈定和她丈夫班尼斯德離婚的時候，雖然事先經過安排，但是班尼斯德所受的打擊，已使他不能在好萊塢立足了。</p>
<p>至於在法庭方面，有許多人是相信法官是專爲保障女權而設，專事蹂躪男權，毫無公理的。在法庭上，女子若能仿模電影中的表演，流下幾滴淚，用些内心表演，將她的已碎的芳心掬示出來。那男子無論理由如何充足，就决無倖勝之理了。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「小偵探」</h3>
<p>— 心</p>
<p>昨天在新光開映的「小偵探」Ｅmil　and　het　Detectives還是烏發公司童片到華的第一張。</p>
<p>這片的本事是很平淡的，只是說一個小孩子在火車上被竊以後，他就暗隨着竊賊，跟到了柏林，結交了柏林的孩子首領。成千的兒童，竟把竊賊擒住，經警署的證明，這竊賊是一個漏網的大盜，于是他們追回被竊的錢，並且還得了巨額的「捕盜懸賞金」。</p>
<p>在這張影片中唯一的好處，就是不脫離現實。</p>
<p>的確發揚了許多良好的天性和訓練；例如兒童的合羣性，勇敢，誠懇，聰明，坦白，好奇，活潑……都能增加成人對于他們的愛護和認識。導演雖不能說極頂的好，但也很不錯。他能呌觀衆心情緊張到萬分，而這種緊張是合理化的。巧妙的鏡頭，良好的發音，穿揷有意味而有趣，剪接上一些破錠不露。光線因外景太多，常有灰色的呈現，似乎美中不足。</p>
<p>全片最大的一個漏洞是「小偵探」跑到「大盜」的臥室送早餐進去，兩人竟對了面，而「大盜」會不認出他是火車上遇見的人，似乎不合情理。此外的一二小漏洞，因爲没有多大的關係，所以不提出來討論。</p>
<p>「兒戲」的地方在所不免，不過爲了成全這一部「童片」，就也不必去深究了</p>
<p>佈景很好，很現出北歐大陸的風光，組織也緊凑，片段之中，常常有出人意外的精彩處。</p>
<p>演角中，男童星以勞夫溢赫ＲaltWeukhausHams最好，有些表情，根本不像一個小孩子所能勝任的。其餘如海球喜姆Ｊaochi　mSchaufuss，等五六人也都充份可愛。許多「小老頭」的舉動，眞是很幽默的滑稽。女童星只有英治南格Inge　Landgut，她的動人，也不在成人明星以下。尤其在末尾，她看了兩個男孩爲愛她而角力，她說：「在我們没成年以前，我同樣須要愛你們兩個人」，這是多麽的流露着爛漫的天眞啊！至於成人的演員她也都是狠好的。</p>
<p>這片中充份地表現出德國的國民性，例如那頑童爲了一個小女孩要打起來時，另一個孩子說：「竊賊没有拿住，别先自己洩私忿吧」這種的理智很是值得我們注意啊！</p>
<p>這片子在實質上，比我們看過那些的童片如「頑童小傳」，「淘哥兒等都勝一籌。兒童們看了，當可得到不少的良好印象吧。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>都會的早晨中可議之處　王人美爲什麽要乞憐？</h3>
<p>— 王侖</p>
<p>劇中的意義，羅明佑君在特刋上，已說明。同是一父所生的兩個少年，一個鷄鳴而起孶孶爲善，一個鷄鳴而起孶孶爲利，所以是片以都會的早晨爲名，是很有意思的。</p>
<p>高占非的小苦力，表演得眞好，幾次拒絶那富人丨他的父親丨的恩惠，眞足以表示最摩登的男性的氣槪。</p>
<p>王人美，活潑天眞，比黎莉莉在天明的表演還要好。她在藝術上應有無限的造就。</p>
<p>但有一點可討論的地方，就是當王人美被騙入富人子的屋中時，她初時竟乞憐，說「少爺，放我去罷，我還有一個父親病倒呢，」我以爲這顯出她的弱辕，應該初時即嚴辭詰問，不應放軟，才顯出她的氣槪！</p>
<h3>好萊塢影界之與文字界</h3>
<p>— 時春</p>
<p>電影爲大衆的藝術。電影事業之發達與否，繫於大衆觀者之評論。是以文字界與電影界之間，具有密切的關係。好萊塢爲世界唯一的電影區域。關於電影事業的報章，其發達亦甲於全球。全美國關於電影的雜誌不下二百餘類。其間除與各公司有關係者外，其餘的論調都能守正不阿。所以劣片一經指摘，遂無容身餘地，崦佳片亦一經褒稱，遂聲譽十倍。</p>
<p>文字界之勢力旣如是的偉大，因此，電影演員和文字界聨絡感情的很多，遇新聞記者訪問時，没有不極誠招待的，然而有許多大名鼎鼎的演員，非但和文字界從不聨絡，且遇有記者的訪問，亦視若不勝其煩，而秘密其行蹤的。最著名拒絶訪問的爲妲露拉彭克海，葛萊泰嘉寳，瓊克勞馥，小范朋克，羅絲却脫登，安娜絲丹，安哈婷等等。</p>
<p>他如曼麗畢克馥與范朋克二人雖不拒絶訪事，然曾和文字界訂有條件，如須刋載曼麗和范朋克的消息文字必須預先通知他二人過目後方能允許公開登載·</p>
<p>與文字界最有聨絡的感情者首推却利卓别麟和威爾勞嘉Ｍill　Rogers二人，卓别麟且常自撰席，寄投雜誌報紙。他曾著有「影界之印象」頗能傳頌一時。威爾勞嘉在無聲片時代脫離影界專從事於筆墨生活，現雖仍入影界荼，然並未完全脫離文字界，撰稿收入，仍有每星期五千元左右，其他埃等康泰，葛洛柯墨克斯Ｇroncho　Morx等，亦在銀幕生活之暇，從事於筆墨工作·</p>
<p>此外喬治亞利斯，約翰巴里摩亞，羅拿可爾門，亞爾喬爾生等皆有問必答，很歡迎記者們過從的，李却白塞爾姆斯更别開生面，雇用一代表專門答覆。新聞記者們，隨帶左右，以免招待不周·</p>
<h3>好萊塢德籍怪明星瑪琳蒂德里許日常俱著男裝。她的理由是女裝的選擇太費時間了，而女裝的式樣變更得太快了。所以常常選到了一套時式衣裳，還没穿上身，但已經不時髦了。</h3>
<h3>談城市之夜</h3>
<p>— 周敬之</p>
<p>爲了欣賞藝術，不惜冒雨驅車到西海去看城市之夜。</p>
<p>全本的劇情，始終是一貫，處處引人入勝，尤其是貧富的對照，有力的字幕，增加，不少價值。</p>
<p>演員方面阮玲玉凄楚表情，金燄風采幽雅的舉動，王桂林的深刻，黎鏗的活潑，紅花綠葉，自是相形益美了。</p>
<p>攝影方面雨天的幾幕，都市的夜景，都很好，不過有幾幕光線似乎太淡。佈景和技巧，尙屬不差。</p>
<p>再則劇中對都市黑暗方面，没有充分的暴露。僅僅舞塲數幕，似覺過於簡單。并且劇情中資本家的兒子愛上了苦工的女兒，其中并没有相當的愛的過程，何以資本家的兒子，這樣熱戀呢？這一點亦有些没有交代清楚。</p>
<h3>好萊塢竊案多</h3>
<p>— 炳</p>
<p>晚近好萊塢的盜賊驟然增加，明星們每有遇竊之事發生。本年二月中好萊塢的竊案大增，蓓丹康潑遜，瓊克勞馥，康絲登裴納，莎麗愛鸞，梅蕙絲德，羅潑范麗絲，等許多明星的家中，都有梁上君子光顧。面其中以蓓丹康潑遜及康絲登裴納二人損失最大。康潑遜竊去了一塊大寶石和一盒玉器，值價三萬七千金元之巨。庚絲登裴納竊去珠練一盒，價值約三萬　金元。</p>
<p>電影小說</p>
<h3>紅塵（Ｒed　Dust）（九）</h3>
<p>— 桀克</p>
<p>格利走後，巴蓓蕾也改變了。他聽見但尼斯的脚步聲，他的眼睛裏就發出一種新鮮明的光彩。他像一個被迷的人，淘醉在一種新奇的快樂裏面。</p>
<p>「那一個，不打門就直闖進來？」有一夜，但尼斯走進他的房間，擁抱着他，他含着笑，柔情密意地說。他的嘴唇又同他的接觸了。</p>
<p>但尼斯思起巴蓓蕾：他的甜密丨温柔丨親愛…但是想到格利！他内在發生情義交戰。他想親近他…他又想離開他…永不再見他！</p>
<p>在情義交戰之中，但尼斯在義的一面清醒轉來，重新要做一個純正的人。他走子一天的遠路，去尋格利，要卢去告訴他一切的一切。但是，他没有勇氣去告訴他。他黄昏的時候，獨自騎著馬踱了回來。他也不走進已蓓蕾的房間。他有點不解，聽見他在客堂裏，把槍和衣服放在桌上，聽見他的脚步聲，走向他自己的房間去，他靜待着，但是他畢竟是不來。他守候得不耐煩，就去輕輕的彈他的門。</p>
<p>「哦」，他自在地說。「你還没有睡」。他把他引到客堂。</p>
<p>「但尼丨你丨告訴了格利没有，」</p>
<p>他抽了一口長氣。他咬緊着牙關。然　他對着他「你不是女學生了！」他野蠻地說。「你怎麽不知道一些兒輕重」，他伸出手，要去擁抱的樣子。但是他顫懍着，退縮了去。他失望極了，他一時想衝到叢林裏去，給那餓虎吃了。他又想到横在桌上但尼斯的手槍…然後，他嗚咽的哭了。</p>
<p>丹在自己的房間裏，聽見他們的聲音，覺得坐立不安。他就貼着墻壁聽。那面出了亂子丨從前没有這樣過！（未完）</p>

<h3>Liu Ruming's Troops Recapture Banbishan</h3>
<p>Enemy reinforcements arrived and shelled our Luowenyu positions</p>
<p>Our troops attacked on both flanks, forcing the enemy to retreat to Xiehe</p>
<p>Outside Lengkou, our troops ambushed Xiaojiayingzi from the Madaogou highlands</p>
<p>Battalion Commander Zhang Kexun bravely took the lead and charged into the enemy ranks, sacrificing himself for his country</p>
<p>(Beiping) A Zunhua telegram reports that after the enemy increased its reinforcements in the Luowenyu area last night, they immediately bombarded our positions with heavy artillery, firing approximately two hundred shells. Their infantry never dared to advance. Our positions sustained no damage. At dawn today, approximately one thousand cavalrymen from Liu Ruming's division attacked Banbishan from the left and right flanks of Luowenyu under enemy artillery fire. After fierce fighting for a long time, the enemy could not withstand the attack and retreated. Our cavalry brigade recaptured Banbishan, killing many enemies and capturing many spoils of war. (26th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A Xifengkou telegram reports that last night, Song's troops selected and organized a dare-to-die team of over three hundred men, who advanced westward from Luowenyu to attack the enemy's Banbishan airfield by surprise. En route, they made contact with the enemy. Our troops fought with extraordinary bravery, and the enemy could not withstand the attack, causing their lines to waver. Liu Ruming's division's cavalry arrived and joined the battle. Late at night, our troops occupied Banbishan. The enemy troops are now溃退retreating to the Xiehe to Yangzishan area, and our troops are pursuing them in victory. (26th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The enemy has concentrated approximately 20,000 troops behind Banbishan to confront our troops on the front lines of Banbishan, which number approximately 15,000. Mutō is directing military operations in the Xiehe area. (26th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Liu Ruming telegraphed from the 25th to Ping, stating that the enemy in front of Luowenyu and Shanzhayu suffered heavy losses after our fierce attack and retreated more than twenty li today from the Banbishan area, stopping in the Anziling and Xiehe area. Our division's cavalry has advanced to the vicinity of Banbishan, pursuing and chasing them. (26th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The enemy in the Xifengkou area is still constructing positions about twenty li outside the mouth, at Mengziling. Their infantry is pre-positioned on the Xifengkou highlands. In the Luowenyu area, at 10:00 AM this morning, the enemy used Taisho 6th Year Type cannons to bombard our Luowenyu from a distance of more than ten li, wounding several of our officers and soldiers. Their infantry did not advance. The enemy's follow-up troops, numbering approximately 2,000, engaged in fierce fighting with our Liu's division. The enemy has abandoned Banbishan and stopped in the Anziling and Xiehe area. In the Hongshankou, between Luowenyu and Xifengkou, and the Xiaoluo River opposite, the enemy has erected bridges, seemingly with the intention of attacking. Our troops have taken strict precautions. (26th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A Qian'an telegram reports that at 2:00 AM this morning in the Lengkou area, Huang's Division Commander, Lin Zuozhen, personally led the third battalion of his regiment to attack Xiaojiayingzi in the enemy's rear from the northeastern highlands of Madaogou. The enemy was extremely panicked and scattered in all directions. After two hours of fierce fighting, our third battalion commander, Zhang Kexun, bravely charged into the enemy ranks, with the entire battalion's officers and soldiers following him in the charge, shouting deafeningly and killing countless enemies. Battalion Commander Zhang also died in battle in that area, and more than thirty soldiers were wounded or killed. At the same time, a large enemy force ambushed our Madaogou positions from the Shanshenmiao, but were repelled by our officers and soldiers. Today, over one hundred enemy corpses were abandoned by the enemy in the mountain gullies. The enemy's side appears to be shaken and seems to be retreating. (26th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A Kaiping telegram reports that, according to a secret report, the enemy's Kwantung Army headquarters has decided to occupy all the passes of the Great Wall. Among the six major passes, Lengkou is particularly important as it is a recessed part of the Great Wall. If Lengkou is occupied, it will not only directly threaten the flanks of the various armies east of the Luo River, but also force the Chinese armies near the passes to the west to retreat. Therefore, they have specially dispatched the Okamura 40th Regiment of the Nakamura Mixed Brigade of the 10th Division, the Tani Infantry 5th Regiment of the Suzuki Group of the 8th Division, the Taniguchi Artillery 10th Regiment, the Kawada Cavalry Regiment, and have also transferred the Hattori Mixed Brigade and a part of the 48th Division from Xifengkou to join the attack. They are launching fierce attacks on Lengkou from all directions, determined to seize Lengkou in a short time. Currently, the enemy's various units have gradually made contact with our army. Since the morning of the 24th, the enemy has continued to use artillery and tanks to cover their infantry in attacks on our Xiaojiayingzi and Majiagou positions, which have been extremely fierce. At the same time, they are using aircraft to bomb our positions repeatedly. Our officers and soldiers are resisting with all their might, killing many enemies. We have also suffered more than ten officer casualties and more than two hundred soldier casualties. 3. A certain unit that was circumventing the encirclement attacked the enemy's rear around 2:00 AM on the 24th, launching a fierce attack on the enemy with hand grenades and broadswords. The enemy could not withstand the attack and retreated slightly. Dozens of enemies were captured, and two armored vehicles were seized. 4. The enemy's continuous attacks for two days were ineffective. After the afternoon of the 24th, in addition to fiercely attacking our positions with aircraft and artillery, their infantry appeared quite calm. 5. Because enemy aircraft have repeatedly bombed our positions for days, our officers and soldiers have suffered considerable casualties, resulting in a shortage of ambulances and materials for transporting the wounded. However, those with lighter injuries have undergone emergency surgery and mostly returned to their positions to continue killing the enemy, unwilling to retreat to rear hospitals. (26th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) In the Lengkou area, our army has fought continuously for five or six nights, killing seven or eight hundred enemies and capturing more than fifty. We have lost one battalion commander, three company commanders, five or six platoon leaders, and three hundred soldiers have been killed or wounded. Our army is building fortifications along the Great Wall. Today, four or five enemy aircraft bombed Lengkou in formation, dropping more than twenty bombs and firing on us with intense artillery fire. Our side suffered more than ten soldier casualties. (26th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shang Zhen telegraphed Ping on the 25th, stating that he inspected the high ground front lines in the 囗囗囗 area and gave instructions to the various officers. The morale of the officers and soldiers on the front lines is high. Division Commander Huang Guanghua and Regiment Commanders Lin Zuozhen, Jiang Jike, and Li Xilin are highly motivated and determined. The construction work along the Great Wall and nearby is extremely solid. The front lines were quite quiet today. Only four aircraft in formation flew over the positions, dropping more than twenty bombs, and artillery fired dozens of shells at our positions. Our losses were minimal. (26th dispatch)</p>
<h3>American Military Attaché Inspects the Front Lines</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The American Embassy sent three military attachés to the front lines for inspection on the 24th. Accompanied by Song, they inspected Xifengkou and Luowenyu. The military attachés returned to Ping yesterday. According to them, Xifengkou and Luowenyu are indeed in the hands of our army, and they deeply praised the spirit of our army's resistance against the enemy. (26th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Enemy Commits Atrocities in Lingyuan</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Weifan telegraphed Ping on the 25th, stating that after the enemy retreated from Luowenyu, our Division Commander Liu Ruming sent troops to clear the positions. A diary was found on the body of Sato Kikabun, the leader of the 31st Unit of the enemy's fallen corpses. The diary contained an entry dated March 2, stating that while camping en route from Chaoyang to Lingyuan, the residents were massacred, regardless of gender or age, because they had engaged in anti-Japanese propaganda. The enemy's inhumane atrocities are hateful and a great shame to our country. (26th telegram)</p>
<h3>Investigation of Casualties Among Song's Troops</h3>
<p>(Beiping) In the previous battles of Xifengkou, Luowenyu, and Shanzhayu, our three divisions of Song's troops bravely resisted, with a total of five officers of the rank of major or above killed in action and fourteen wounded.

<h3>Beiping Sets Up Military Hospitals</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Chengnan Amusement Park, formerly a place of recreation for the people of Beiping, has now been converted into a military hospital. Many wounded soldiers from the Xifengkou front have been treated here. The People's Military Hospital, managed by a committee composed of Peking University faculty, has also opened its doors. Its location is the Shoushan Factory on Wangfujing Street. Peking University President Jiang Menglin is personally in charge of hospital affairs. Most of the doctors and nurses are from the Chinese Red Cross Society and the Salvation Army. Its expenses are collected from donations from university faculty and staff. Shanghai Customs officials have remitted 10,000 yuan to Ping to be distributed to the soldiers of Song Zheyuan's troops, praising their courage in resisting Japan at Xifengkou.

Our troops immediately bombed the enemy with hand grenades. The enemy could not withstand the attack and retreated, and the positions were occupied. By noon, the enemy again fired on our side with artillery, and our side retreated back to the original defensive positions. (26th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Near Nanguan in Gubeikou, Chinese are prohibited from passing, seemingly due to special circumstances. Young farmers are being seized and forced to work. The enemy in Gubeikou has slightly decreased, seemingly due to troop movements. Currently, there are one thousand Japanese soldiers, more than two thousand puppet troops, and more than one thousand Mongolian troops stationed there, constructing fortifications in Nanguan. (26th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The enemy in Gubeikou has increased in numbers in recent days, totaling approximately 5,000. Among them, the most numerous are the puppet troops, Mongol bandits, and Korean troops. The Japanese army is less than two thousand. A large amount of supplies have been transported in, with intentions to attack. At dawn on the 24th, 3,000 enemies attacked Maguan, but were repelled. On the same day, the enemy also bombed Miyun with aircraft, dropping four bombs in the Chaohetao area, 25 li north of Miyun, killing six cavalrymen and wounding nine. (26th dispatch)</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Arrives in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Meets with Wang Jingwei and Others at Military Academy</p>
<p>Issue of Premier Can Be Resolved Soon</p>
<p>Central Committee To Hold Emergency Meeting This Morning</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chiang Kai-shek arrived in Kaifeng by plane from Baoding at 10:00 AM on the 25th. At 6:30 PM, he took a special train southward from Kaifeng. He arrived in Pukou at 10:00 AM on the 26th, accompanied by several attendants and secretaries, including Deng Wenyi. After getting off the train, he crossed the river and entered the city, going directly to the official residence at the Central Military Academy to rest. Wang, Sun, Ye, Luo, and other important figures arrived at the military academy at 11:00 AM to meet with him, and the meeting dispersed at 12:00 PM. (26th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has left Baoding and returned to Nanjing to meet with Wang Jingwei. (26th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After Premier Wang arrived in Nanjing, Dai Chuanxian, Ju Zheng, Ye Chucang, Luo Wengan, Chen Guofu, Zhu Peide, Chen Shaokuan, and others visited him at his official residence and talked for an hour. The important figures all strongly urged Wang to resume his duties. At 10:00 AM, Chiang Kai-shek's special train arrived in Pukou, and he crossed the river and entered the city. Central figures, including Wang, all went to the military academy at 11:00 AM to meet with Chiang. Chiang also strongly urged Wang to resume his duties. Wang and others left at noon. The matter of resuming his duties should not be a problem. (26th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Committee has decided to hold an important meeting on the morning of the 27th after the memorial week. Wang Jingwei, Chiang Kai-shek, and all important figures in Nanjing are scheduled to attend the meeting. There will be a thorough discussion of national defense, diplomacy, and other issues. (26th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After Chiang arrived in Nanjing, he had a discussion with the Central Committee members and the ministers of the various yuan about the issue of Wang resigning from his position as Premier. They all advocated sincerely persuading him to stay. At 3:30 PM, Chiang personally went to Wang's residence to persuade him to withdraw his resignation with the utmost sincerity. They had a secret talk for about two hours before Chiang left. It is said that Wang is still being modest about resuming his duties. However, according to general observations, although Wang is humbly declining, he may withdraw his resignation under the urging of Chiang and various parties, and reluctantly accept the position. (26th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the latest reliable news, after Wang and Chiang had a secret talk on the afternoon of the 26th, Wang still expressed his hope that Premier Song would be formally appointed as Premier, but he no longer firmly insisted on it. It is expected that he will resume his duties in the coming days. At the Central Political Council meeting on Wednesday (the 29th), a resolution will be made on Wang's resumption of duties. The Central Committee will convene an important meeting on the morning of the 27th, but it is for the preparation of major plans, not for the issue of Wang's resumption of duties. (26th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

<h3>Li Liejun Arrives in Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>丨Publishes Statement丨</p>
<p>Chiang, Feng, and Yan All Have the Determination to Resist Japan</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Li Liejun arrived in Nanjing at 8:00 AM on the 26th. He will stay for two or three days and then go to Shanghai. He is scheduled to attend an important meeting of the Central Committee on the 27th and will present his opinions. Li issued the following statement:</p>
<p>"Previously, when the bandits were pressing Rehe, I went north to inspect, hoping to enable my colleagues in the north to quickly unite their efforts to protect this northern border. Unexpectedly, due to shortcomings in politics, the people's hearts were not consolidated, giving the enemy an opportunity. Although all parties had a common desire to strive, they could only sigh in frustration. Since Chiang went north to reorganize the war situation, the arrangements have become more strict, and there should be other measures on the front lines. What I am paying attention to is also political reform, and I believe that combining the wisdom and courage of the people of the whole country is the fundamental problem to solve the national crisis. I have repeatedly discussed this in detail with Chiang in Baoding, and he has agreed very much, so I will return to Nanjing to make a better plan. If the fundamental plan can be decided early, the whole country will be excited, and even if the Japanese are strong, they can eventually be defeated. National affairs cannot be counted by the day, but there is more than enough time to count by the month. The important thing is that people have the will to strive, and scholars have long-term plans. In the past, the King of Yue was able to destroy Wu after ten years, even with the remnants of a fallen country. How much more so today, when we have only suffered a few setbacks, can we still save the situation?" Answering reporters' questions, he said, "Zhang is leading a peaceful life in Baoding, and is very diligent in his studies. His determination to resist Japan is very firm. He once said to me, 'I have four pistols, you and I can each take two and fight the enemy.' Moreover, he has several hundred guards available. Therefore, if the Central Committee has a strategy, he will be happy to obey and go to the front to kill the enemy. With the Central Committee's political leadership responsible, it is useless for Feng to come to Nanjing. I only hope that he can serve on the battlefield. Yan Xishan's determination to resist Japan is the same as Feng's. Han Fuqu has 100,000 soldiers and will absolutely obey the Central Committee and await its orders. Chiang's attitude is very clear and can be included in two words, that is, 'his determination to resist Japan is becoming more and more firm, and his attitude towards politics has greatly changed.'" (26th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3>Shen Honglie and Others' Whereabouts</h3>
<p>(Jinan) This morning, Shen Honglie, Fang Juehui, and Ge Guangting came to Jinan from Qingdao. Shen said that his previous resignation was because he felt that his personal talents and abilities were insufficient. He was persuaded to stay by Chiang, He, Han, and other gentlemen, and he will try to live up to their expectations and maintain Shandong's security together with Han. Qingdao City is now striving to develop civilian industries. Last year, 400,000 meters of rural roads were repaired, which is equal to what was repaired in the 20 years of German and Japanese rule. The education budget was originally 480,000 yuan per year, but it was increased by 240,000 yuan last year. Fang said that Shen's resignation has been withdrawn, and he has reported this to Chiang and He. There are now a total of eleven Japanese warships in North China. The number of destroyers has been increased from three to four, with three stationed in Dagu. The cruisers Tama and Tokiwa are currently in Qingdao, and their commander, Tsuda, arrived in Qingdao today aboard the flagship Hirado. The Wakamiya aircraft carrier/oiler and three destroyers are stationed in Qinhuangdao, and one destroyer is stationed in Lushun. In addition, there are no Japanese warships in Yantai and Longkou.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Can Japanese Warlords Truly Awaken?</h3>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, our country's consistent mistaken policy has been its inability to adopt a decisive attitude and stand on the front line to seek a solution to the problem through our own efforts. Instead, we have repeatedly avoided the facts in order to seek temporary ease. Initially, we relied on the League of Nations, hoping that the so-called international treaties could exert their authority and uphold justice. When the policy of relying on the League of Nations failed, various proposals such as "reproduction and education to save the country" arose one after another. The substance of these proposals to save the country still amounted to avoiding reality, suggesting that the people should endure the present and hope for the future in order to seek spiritual comfort. This consistent mentality since the September 18th Incident has completely disarmed the spirit of our nation. Therefore, Heilongjiang Province followed Liaoning and Jilin Provinces and fell, and Jinzhou, Yuguan, and even the recent Rehe Province followed Heilongjiang Province and were lost. Yet, our entire country is still enjoying peace and indulging in poison, like swallows on a curtain, unaware of the danger. Recently, Hu Shi has once again shifted his gaze from his past hopes for the League of Nations to the warlords of Tokyo, hoping that they will know when to stop. He said, "The Japanese should wake up." He even made thorough plans for the Japanese imperialists, saying, "The Japanese only have one way to conquer China, which is to rein in their horses and thoroughly stop invading China, and instead conquer the hearts of the Chinese people." He also said, "Only by the Japanese thoroughly repenting of invading China can they conquer China." This kind of hope still amounts to being cowardly and seeking temporary ease, not daring to stand on the front line of reality, unwilling to rely on self-reliance, self-help, and self-rescue. On the other hand, its significance is even to offer advice to the Japanese imperialists, teaching them how to conquer the Chinese nation, advising them to abandon gunboat diplomacy, and instead implement the slogan of "developing China" through peaceful cooperation in order to tightly grasp the essence of China, so that the Chinese nation will gradually move towards death in a state of "anemia." The people of the whole country should pay close attention to this kind of spirit-numbing argument.</p>
<p>We can assert that those who invade China are not all Japanese, but the Japanese warlords and capitalists. Under violent rule and militarist policies, the suffering endured by the majority of Japanese people is no lighter than what we are suffering today. We sincerely hope that the majority of Japanese people, who are suffering under the warlord political violence, will resolutely rise up for their own sake, for the sake of saving China, a friendly country, and for the sake of maintaining world peace, and oppose the Japanese imperialists' policy of aggression. However, we must never place any hope on the Japanese warlords, appealing to them to "lay down their butcher knives" and asking them to stop their aggressive steps. After all, "seeking the skin of a tiger" is already an error below common sense. Moreover, the Japanese imperialists' aggression against China is precisely because capitalism is stimulated by economic panic and has to use the policy of "re-dividing colonies" in an attempt to save its collapsing end. Therefore, those who hold this hope are fundamentally ignorant of the situation in world politics and economics, and are showing their "death throes" in the turbulent tide.</p>
<p>We believe that under the current circumstances, the majority of Japanese people should wake up, and the majority of Chinese people should wake up even more. What should the Chinese people awaken to? That is, to thoroughly break the psychology of dependence, thoroughly break the psychology of hoping that the enemy will repent, and thoroughly break the psychology of national complacency. Only self-reliance can lead to self-help, and only self-reliance can lead to self-rescue. Those who can prevent the Japanese imperialists' aggression and strive for the survival and freedom of our nation are those who mobilize the entire nation and launch a national revolutionary war. There is no other way out, and there is absolutely no way to survive.</p>
<p>Issue of the Pacific Islands Under Mandate</p>
<h3>Secret Negotiations Between Japan and Germany</h3>
<h3>Joint Action by the German Government and the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that the issue of the South Pacific Islands is becoming increasingly serious. If it is not handled properly, it will provoke the world. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs ordered the Japanese Embassy in Germany to contact the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Yesterday, the Acting Ambassador to Germany visited the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs to discuss the matter. The German government said that this case cannot be handled alone and will cooperate with the League of Nations. Although Japan is willing to offer considerable conditions to please Germany, the German government has not yet given a definite reply. (China United Press Dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is believed here that after Japan withdraws from the League of Nations, Germany may formally demand that the Japanese government return the former German South Pacific Islands under Japanese mandate. If Germany does make a request, Japan will ignore it. (Reuters Dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>Notification of Withdrawal from the League of Nations Today</p>
<h3>Japanese Diplomatic Strategy</h3>
<p>Reportedly Decided by Araki and Uchida</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is scheduled to send a telegram in English to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Drummond, at 3:00 PM on the 27th, and at the same time telegraph Japanese embassies abroad to explain the reasons for withdrawing from the League of Nations to their host governments. Foreign Minister Uchida will convene ambassadors and ministers from various countries in Tokyo to resolve the reasons for withdrawing from the League of Nations and future diplomatic policies in detail, and seek the understanding of various countries. The diplomatic strategy of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs after withdrawing from the League of Nations is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The peace of the Far East is closely related to China, Russia, and the United States. After withdrawing from the League of Nations, diplomacy will be based on policies towards China, Russia, and the United States, and will manipulate Britain, France, Germany, and Italy to achieve the ultimate goal.</p>
<p>(2) To the United States, make every effort to implore the new government to abandon the Stimson Doctrine. In the Far East, Japan's hegemony must be recognized, and the policy of hegemony should no longer be the basic policy. Focus on commercial interests and use economic relations to resolve the contradictions between Japan and the United States.</p>
<p>(3) To the Soviet Union, demand recognition of "Manchukuo." If the Soviet Union is willing to recognize "Manchukuo," which was created by Japan, Japan will sign a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union. Currently, trade and mutual benefit will be used as a means to ease conflicts.</p>
<p>(4) To China, seek opportunities to initiate direct negotiations. Currently, use certain methods to promote internal strife in China, brew a new situation, make China feel the crisis of destruction, and agree to Japan's demands for direct Sino-Japanese negotiations, with Sino-Japanese-Manchu cooperation to resist the white race as the ultimate goal. However, maintain a silent attitude for the time being.</p>
<p>(5) To Britain, continue to demand the restoration of the Anglo-Japanese alliance. Use the old friendship of the Anglo-Japanese alliance to ask Britain to recognize the situation created by the Japanese army by force and not hinder Japan's policy of dominating Asia. Japan will sign a corresponding new treaty with Britain based on economic and commercial interests.</p>
<p>(6) Since the September 18th Incident, France has consistently recognized Japan's military actions in Manchuria. It is hoped that France can continue to approach Japan. Japan is determined to reconsider its commercial interests in Annam.</p>
<p>(7) To other European and American countries, generally cancel the extreme policy. However, still express considerable participation in world peace undertakings.</p>
<p>(8) In various parts of the South Pacific and South America, all resident consuls will be replaced to create closer new economic and cultural relations, in order to enable the people of the South Pacific and South America to support and support Japan's new policies.</p>
<p>(According to the above diplomatic strategy, it came from Araki and Uchida. Apart from their subordinates and a group of dreamers who believe it can be realized, the political circles are highly skeptical.) (China United Press Dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>Issue of US-Soviet Diplomatic Relations</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt told newspaper reporters that he had discussed the issue of recognizing the Soviet Union with Republican Senator La Follette of Wisconsin. La Follette had traveled to the Soviet Union and recently returned home. (TASS Dispatch from the 25th) World News Agency Tokyo reports that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has the following observations regarding the United States' recognition of the Soviet Union, believing that the significance of the United States' recognition of the Soviet Union during the Republican government was only to ensure the United States' claims against the Soviet Union and increase commercial interests, and the discussions in and out of the government were divided into opposing factions. As for the recent Democratic Party in power, there has been a sudden shift in the trend towards recognizing the Soviet Union, and its realization is only a matter of time. Public opinion in and out of the government has been in favor, and most senators believe that in order to solve the Manchurian problem based on the principle of not changing existing treaties, it is necessary to find a strong partner in the Far East to work with. Therefore, their advocacy of recognizing Soviet Russia contains political significance. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that it is necessary to be vigilant about this situation, and is currently anticipating various scenarios and considering countermeasures.</p>

<p>Zeng Zhongming Talks</p>
<h3>Suspension of Boxer Indemnity Payments Affects Guangdong Railways</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Zeng Zhongming said that the construction of double tracks on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway is difficult to realize for the time being. The suspension of Boxer Indemnity payments will affect the completion of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. If payments continue to be suspended next year, the fund for the previously issued public bonds will have to be raised separately, because it was originally intended to use the British Boxer Indemnity funds for the next ten years as a fund to issue 20 million yuan in public bonds to complete the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. The project from Shaozhou to Lechang has been 80-90% completed, and it is expected to be open to traffic next month. The Xiang-E section of the Lechang-Guangdong-Hankou Railway was poorly managed in the past, and the journey took more than 24 hours. Recently, the Ministry of Railways sent personnel to set up a reorganization committee, and all reorganizations are better than before. Zeng said at the end that the development of transportation requires the construction of railways as soon as possible. In today's difficult times, the use of foreign capital is necessary, but sovereignty still belongs to us, and foreigners are only creditors. (Special Dispatch from the 26th)</p>

<h3>Changes in US War Debt Policy</h3>
<p>Economic Issues Discussed Separately</p>
<p>Inviting Countries to Reduce Tariffs Universally</p>
<p>Resuming Negotiations with France</p>
<p>Washington Dispatch from The National Gazette, 25th: Today, U.S. Secretary of State Hull solemnly declared that mutual tariff reductions and other economic issues will be discussed entirely separately from the war debt issue. Several parties here are deeply convinced that the U.S. government has decided on a policy to deal with countries that have defaulted on war debts. Although Hull said when issuing the statement that it was to eliminate some misunderstandings, the general interpretation is that the Roosevelt administration has reversed the policy of the Hoover administration. This statement not only reopens the door to negotiations with France but also indirectly invites France to propose some proposals regarding the penalty period of war debts and future debt repayment procedures for discussion. This is because Hull said that he could not say clearly at this time whether he would sit down with these defaulting countries in future discussions, but he was eager to obtain the cooperation of various countries to prepare for the world economic conference, regardless of their war debt status. He also said that tariffs would be viewed entirely from an economic perspective and would not be discussed from a war debt perspective. It is widely believed that this remark is sufficient to indicate that war debts will no longer become an exchange trade issue. It is also heard that Hull has completed the study of the memorandum sent by British Ambassador Lindsay and has also sent a memorandum to Lindsay. These informal documents discuss the war debt structure on a broad basis. It is also reported that the two documents have been forwarded to President Roosevelt for detailed study with his advisor, Moralais. In addition, it is believed that the U.S. President will soon propose that all countries universally reduce tariffs in order to seek the revival of world trade and will authorize the U.S. representatives to present this proposal at the economic conference.</p>
<h3>American Gold Bullion Standard</h3>

Furthermore, gold bullion transactions will be limited to legitimate commercial needs as defined by the Treasury Department.</p>
<p>French Government Discussion</p>
<h3>The Four-Power Cooperation Plan in Europe</h3>
<p>Decides to Adopt a Wait-and-See Attitude</p>
<p>The Little Entente Opposes Treaty Revision</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 25th - The French Cabinet today discussed the four-power understanding plan drafted by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, which includes France, Britain, Germany, and Italy. The discussion lasted a long time. According to a semi-official statement, the Cabinet will not make a decision for the time being but will wait to ascertain the attitudes of the governments concerned, especially those not previously consulted, before determining its course of action. The Cabinet also discussed the overdue payment of war debts to the United States.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 25th - Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain gave a speech at the White Memorial last night, expressing optimism about the future of Britain. He asked the British people to trust the government so that it could complete its work, stating that Britain's credit system had been fully restored. People from other countries were now flocking to Britain with gold, considering it a safer place. Britain, formerly the world's third-largest exporter, had now regained its position as the leading exporter. Over two hundred new factories in Britain were established with foreign capital, and no fewer than twenty foreign governments had requested to negotiate new commercial treaties with Britain. British agriculture had been thoroughly reorganized, and farmers currently had greater hope and confidence in the future. As for the issue of the new Indian political system, it was very difficult. The government was deeply aware of its dangers but would approach it with patience, goodwill, wisdom, and determination, and would eventually resolve this difficult problem. In the past week, the European situation had undergone significant changes as a result of the British Prime Minister's visits to Geneva and Rome. Britain's interest lay in maintaining peace, but it would be wrong to say that "we do not want to fight." In fact, what "we" desire is to go a step further than just war; to the best of "our" ability, to resolve difficulties and mediate disputes, to save other countries from the scourge of war, "this" is "our" responsibility.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 25th - Former Polish President and renowned pianist Paderewski stated to "Paris Soir" yesterday, "When I was in power, I said, 'If anyone plots to divide Poland, we will know how to resist them.'" He continued, "The 'Corridor' is Poland's gateway to the sea. The people within the Corridor are all loyal to Poland. If Germany wants to reclaim all the territories it lost after the European War, then the Silesia region will also be taken by Germany. In that case, France feels the same threat as Poland."</p>
<p>Havas, Lisbon, 26th - The Cabinet issued an unofficial statement to the press, stating that foreign newspapers had published the four-power cooperation plan discussed by British Prime Minister MacDonald in Rome, which involved Portuguese colonies. After Italian Prime Minister Mussolini explained the matter to the Portuguese Minister to Rome, the Portuguese government could declare that Portuguese colonies were not mentioned during the Rome discussions on the four-power cooperation plan, and there were no provisions in the plan regarding colonial policy. In a letter from the Italian Prime Minister to the Portuguese Minister to Italy, he expressed Italy's loyalty to Portugal and stated that it was in the Italian Prime Minister's personal interest to promote friendly relations between Italy and Portugal.</p>
<p>Havas, Madrid, 26th - Foreign Minister Xu Luda announced his views on Spanish foreign policy, stating that the Spanish Republic was always prepared to cooperate with all actions beneficial to peace. The Spanish representative in Geneva expressed deep sympathy for the French plan and praised the efforts of the MacDonald Cabinet. A sincere agreement among the four major powers could not only prevent war but also establish a league among nations to resolve various European problems. However, this agreement should not become a special pact among a few countries but should become a general understanding, allowing all peace-loving countries to participate. Otherwise, if the spirit of Geneva is abandoned, the progress of international politics will inevitably become negative.</p>
<p>The Little Entente</p>
<h3>Issues a Declaration of Opposition</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 25th - Today, representatives of the Little Entente countries held an important meeting here, the purpose of which was to establish a so-called "League of Central and Small European Nations" to counter the "dictatorship" system that the major powers were attempting to establish. It is said that the Little Entente countries are prepared to issue a declaration. There are many rumors circulating, but whether they can be confirmed in the future, the seriousness of the content of this declaration can be predicted.</p>
<p>Havas, Geneva, 25th - The Standing Committee of the Little Entente countries met in Geneva today and issued a communiqué stating, "After careful consideration of recent international events, the Standing Committee of the Little Entente countries believes that countries aspiring to establish relations with each other and wanting to resolve issues specifically related to those countries should engage in cooperation. This cooperation can yield good results. However, if countries sign various treaties that force signatory countries to take concrete actions or merely allow signatory countries to exert pressure on countries outside the treaty to achieve their goal of disposing of the rights of third parties, such means, which are said to benefit good relations between countries, cannot be recognized by the Little Entente countries. From a legal standpoint, no one's property, whether directly or indirectly, can be disposed of. Therefore, the Little Entente countries specifically reserve their rights regarding the desire of countries to enter into such treaties that infringe upon the rights and politics of the Little Entente countries. Such treaties have become a thing of the past. In any case, they cannot exist after the establishment of the League of Nations. Furthermore, the proposal to revise treaties has recently emerged, which is regrettable. Mutual trust is essential for cooperation between countries, but revising treaties cannot reassure countries or increase their trust. The only result is to provoke firm resistance. In the interest of international peace, the Little Entente countries believe that all countries should pay attention to this. For this reason, the Little Entente countries believe that they should concentrate their efforts on building peace, as there is no other way to maintain world peace and security."</p>
<p>Havas, Lyon, 25th - The new Latvian Foreign Minister declared to the press that Latvia should cooperate closely with Estonia and Lithuania and maintain friendly relations with other Baltic Sea countries to stabilize the political situation in Northeastern Europe. Latvia's trade relations with Poland and the Soviet Union are not easy to resolve, but we sincerely hope that they can be resolved.</p>
<h3>Shift in Franco-Polish Relations</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Warsaw, 25th - Today, the Polish Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee discussed the issue of France's recent very cold attitude towards Poland. Count Reder Wilber, in his speech, appealed to the French public not to change their attitude towards Poland because of the country's internal affairs. He hoped that the French would not only respect Hitler in Germany but also Piłsudski in Poland. Although Polish internal affairs might not be trusted by France, the Polish people should decide for themselves the best way to overcome this difficulty. Subsequently, Polish Foreign Minister Beck spoke, but he was unable to offer a more optimistic view of Franco-Polish relations.</p>
<p>Italy Accepts</p>
<h3>British Disarmament Plan</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 25th - Today, the General Commission of the Disarmament Conference continued its meeting. The Italian representative declared that the Italian government fully accepted the new British proposal, only suggesting some minor changes. Representatives from other countries, including Canada, Greece, Estonia, Finland, Austria, and Bulgaria, all expressed their approval in principle of the British proposal, but each had submitted minor amendments.</p>
<h3>Closing of the Japanese Parliament</h3>
<p>Various Financial Difficulties</p>
<p>Japan News Agency, Tokyo, 26th - The closing ceremony of the Parliament was held today in the House of Peers. Because the Emperor did not attend, Prime Minister Saitō read the Imperial Rescript. After the closing ceremony, the Prime Minister entered the palace to meet with the Emperor, reported on the results and outlines of the Parliament's proceedings, and answered questions. The Emperor bestowed upon the Prime Minister a jar of sake and two fresh fish to reward his efforts.</p>
<p>Japan News Agency, Tokyo, 26th - Although the government's massive budget of 2.3 billion yen was passed by both houses of Parliament, both houses attached a warning resolution due to the unprecedented financial plan, requesting the government to immediately establish a financial plan to balance revenues and expenditures. Therefore, the government bears a significant responsibility for future financial issues. However, the current financial situation faces various difficulties, including: (1) The total budget reaches an unprecedented 2.3 billion yen; (2) There are still over 1 billion yen in public debt and 800 million yen in expenditure exceeding public debt; (3) Regular expenditures exceed regular revenues, violating financial principles; (4) Military expenses and Manchurian Incident expenses account for half of the budget; (5) The public does not have the ability to bear increased taxes. Under these difficult conditions, to establish a stable financial policy, it is necessary to have talents like Finance Minister Takahashi to reform the fundamentals of Japanese finance.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 26th - The Minseitō (Constitutional Democratic Party) held a general meeting of its Diet members at the Marunouchi Central Hall at 4:00 PM today. Advisors, general affairs officers, secretaries, and members of both houses of Parliament attended. Mr. Kakurō Nomura served as chairman. Mr. Tomita, representing the general affairs officers of the party, and Mr. Sadakichi Ichimatsu, representing the secretaries, delivered speeches. Afterwards, President Wakatsuki delivered the following speech. After the meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM, a social gathering was held. The main points of President Wakatsuki's speech were as follows: "Recently, there have been rumors of a political change, but the current situation is more serious than when the Saitō Cabinet was established. Therefore, a change of the Wakatsuki Cabinet is unimaginable. To help the current situation without addressing the aftermath is not what a politician with heavy responsibilities should do. However, if such a situation were to occur, our party should act solely in the interest of the nation."</p>
<p>United Chinese News Agency, Tokyo, 26th - The Japanese Diet closed today. Various factions remain perplexed about the future of the political situation. The government and the Minseitō announced that the Saitō Cabinet, which bears the mission of an extraordinary period, cannot easily step down before the situation in North China is fully resolved. The Seiyūkai (Rikken Seiyūkai) stated that the 64th Diet had passed peacefully, and the government should honor its commitment to step down. The Kokumin Dōmei (National Alliance) said that although the extraordinary period had not ended, Saitō was no longer capable of handling this major crisis. The views of the various factions remain divided. However, it has become increasingly clear that the core of the development of the Japanese political situation will be determined by the changes in the situation in North China.</p>
<h3>The Sorrows of American Farmers (New York Correspondence) (February 20th)</h3>
<p>American farmers seem to be trapped in a hopeless situation. For over a hundred years, the fate of American farmers was envied by European farmers. They occupied a virgin continent and, almost until the end of the 19th century, gradually moved westward towards the Pacific coast, freely reclaiming wasteland without restrictions. However, the emergence of large speculative banks, industries, and railroad trusts occurred earlier in the United States than in any other country. These speculative banks and trusts exploited and oppressed farmers in various ways, raising the prices of industrial products and railroad freight rates. Therefore, in the last ten years of the 19th century, the American countryside was often the source of political discontent.</p>
<p>After World War I, American farmers did not experience the so-called prosperous era of the United States and did not find a way into the "capitalist paradise." Although the civilization of modern urban capitalism, such as machines, automobiles, electricity, and radio, had widely penetrated the countryside, the prices of major agricultural products were almost always much lower than the prices of essential industrial products. When the wave of economic panic broke out in 1929, American farmers were simply plunged into the abyss and could not extricate themselves. American farmers now truly face a situation where they cannot stand on heaven or touch the earth. Because they were unable to pay taxes and repay debts and interest, the government and banks, insurance companies, etc., confiscated their land and auctioned it off. Such auctions were commonplace. In Virginia in December of last year, more than 800 farm households were auctioned off in half an hour on one day, accounting for one-fifth of the farmers in the entire county. In Mississippi in April of last year, 40,000 farm households were auctioned off in one day for non-payment of taxes, covering approximately 7 million acres of land, which is approximately one-quarter of all farmland in the state. The majority of farmers were not only unable to sell their own products but also unable to supply their own needs due to over-specialization of production. In the southern states, approximately 40 percent of all American farmland is used to grow corn and cotton, so they naturally cannot eat only corn or cotton. Most of the harvested corn is burned. In some places, large numbers of children are starving, while in other places, milk is used to feed pigs. According to official materials, in 1930, 140 million pounds of fruit were destroyed in California, and thousands of tons were thrown into the sea.</p>
<p>However, under these circumstances, large numbers of farmers are starving and freezing, unable to find enough to eat. Key American government officials also acknowledge this point. The well-known two-volume report of the Hoover Research Committee, which was published not long ago, admitted, "Agricultural product prices are too low, making it difficult for even well-off farm households with good land to survive." According to a report from the American Secretary of Agriculture, in 1931, farmers and their families only earned slightly more than half of what they used to pay hired laborers. The income from farmers' own land was even less than what their hired laborers earned. And in the days when millions of unemployed people are seeking work, the lives of hired laborers are unimaginable. According to a government statistic, "A person can be hired by merely providing a meal and some money or no money at all."</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, many farmers are willing to abandon their land, but no one will buy it. The selling price of the land is often lower than the value of the buildings. In other words, the land is given away for free. In the past few years, farmers could still escape to the cities, but now there are more than 15 million unemployed workers in the cities, which is enough to scare away farmers. In the past decade, regardless of how "prosperous" the United States has been, over 15 million farm households, or approximately one-quarter of all farmers, have left the countryside and moved to the cities with their families. But now the situation is the opposite. Unemployed people are fleeing from the cities back to the countryside in a panic, seeking out huts and food. In 1931, the number of people moving from cities to the countryside in the United States was twice the number of people moving from the countryside to the cities. According to the most recent census, in 1930, a total of 680,000 people left the cities in the United States, while only 372,000 people left the countryside.</p>
<p>In this way, the countryside feels the real problem of overpopulation. Farmers whose property has been auctioned off either become unemployed or go to work as laborers. In the western states, there are tens of thousands of homeless farmers wandering around. Homeless children and young people are a new phenomenon in the United States. This phenomenon is now growing significantly. According to newspaper reports, there are now over 500,000 such vagrant children. Although there is overpopulation in the countryside, the birth rate is greatly reduced due to poverty. According to the Hoover Committee report, if this situation continues, the total population of the United States will greatly decrease in one or two decades.</p>
<p>"Overproduction" 丨 Price Crash</p>
<p>What has brought the richest farmers in the world to this point? Capitalists answer that it is because of too much production and a sharp drop in prices, especially because farmers are producing too much cotton, wheat, fruit, butter, etc. In fact, in the past ten years, the production of major agricultural products in the United States has indeed increased significantly. The sown area in the United States, Argentina, Canada, Australia, and other countries has increased by one-fifth compared to before the war. In addition, with the application of new agricultural machinery, the average per capita production in the United States increased by approximately 17 percent in the five years after World War I. However, the expansion of the sown area and the application of machinery have led to "overproduction," not because the number of hungry people has decreased. There are indeed many more hungry people. China alone can absorb all the "surplus." As is well known, "overproduction" is only because these hungry people cannot afford to buy bread and meat. The iron rule of capitalism is such. The work of all its production organs is not to meet the needs of the people but for profit. The expansion of the sown area and the application of machinery are originally for the benefit of mankind, but under capitalism, they have turned into sins.</p>
<p>In addition, a few trusts control all industries and can manipulate prices to exploit consumers, but this is difficult for millions of scattered farmers. They only compete ruthlessly with each other. Once a panic arrives, industrialists can immediately reduce production and lay off workers, but farmers cannot lay off themselves. Therefore, the prices of American agricultural products, like those in other countries, have fallen more sharply and drastically than the prices of industrial products. The massive unemployment that engulfs the country is first reflected in the fate of farmers. Europe, which has lost faith in the United States, has also stopped buying American agricultural products. As a result, the prices of major agricultural products have plummeted, and the price crash has given speculators and large trusts an opportunity to exploit farmers even further. All the heavy burdens of the economic panic are passed on to the farmers. For example, the drop in wholesale grain prices in the United States last spring was less than one-third (28 percent), while the price received by farmers fell by two-thirds (63 percent) (this is still according to official materials from the Department of Agriculture). In other words, a bushel of wheat in the spring of 1932 was only worth one-third of what it was in 1928, and it is even less now.</p>
<p>As a result, the total value of American agricultural products has suddenly shrunk. In 1929, it was approximately 12 billion gold dollars; in 1930, it had fallen to 9 billion gold dollars; in 1931, it had fallen to below 7 billion gold dollars; and in 1932, it had fallen to 5 billion gold dollars.</p>
<p>"Excessive Taxation"</p>
<p>Taxes and usury are an even heavier blow to bankrupt farmers. The tax system in the United States is mainly based on real estate tax, and farmers are its main victims. The amount of tax paid by each farmer is now two and a half times higher than before World War I. This is still based on monetary calculations. If calculated in terms of wheat and cotton, the taxes paid by American farmers have increased approximately fivefold since World War I. This is also based on government statistics.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, farmers' property is often confiscated and auctioned off for inability to pay taxes. In impoverished areas, because production has shrunk, young farmers are unable to survive and try their best to escape. According to the two-volume Hoover Committee report, "After the death or escape of the remaining owner, his property is confiscated... Schools are decreasing due to lack of funding and students. Churches have been closed. All social life is becoming increasingly pessimistic." (To be continued)</p>
<h3>The Truth About the Tianjin-Hangu Negotiations</h3>
<p>The Japanese Side Makes Unreasonable Arguments and Attempts to Disrupt Tianjin and Beiping</p>
<p>Our Side Refutes Based on Reason with a Firm Attitude</p>
<p>Special dispatch from Beiping: After the Japanese army launched a large-scale invasion of Rehe, in addition to increasing troops and ships in Shanhaiguan and Qinhuangdao to contain our military strength, the Japanese Consul in Tianjin, Sangishima, also used the pretext of the defense of Dagu to protest to the Tianjin local authorities, making empty threats in an attempt to achieve their sinister schemes. When the first protest was raised, the Tianjin authorities immediately refuted it. The Japanese Consul, unwilling to give up, instigated the consuls of various countries stationed in Tianjin to jointly protest to us. The consuls of various countries did not approve of his actions and dismissed them with a laugh. Since the Japanese Consul did not receive the sympathy of the other consuls, he once again acted alone and insisted on raising a second, third, and even fourth protest to us. Our authorities all refuted them based on reason and remained unmoved. The Japanese Consul then went even further, formally demanding that we withdraw our troops stationed in Tianjin, which was unreasonable and provocative. The pretext they used was the Boxer Protocol and its annexes regarding the Dagu issue. Article 8 of the Protocol stipulates that "The Chinese government has agreed to raze the Dagu Forts and all other forts that impede the passage from Beijing to the sea." However, the Dagu Forts were destroyed long ago, and our country has not rebuilt them nearby, nor are there any facilities that impede the passage from Beijing to the sea. Therefore, there is no violation of the Protocol whatsoever. How can the Japanese Consul use this as an excuse? Regarding the issue of troops stationed in Tianjin, there are no provisions in the text of the Boxer Protocol. It is only mentioned briefly in the note on the return of Tianjin, which states, "Since the entire city of Tianjin is also within this agreed number, after the abolition of the Tutong Yamen, the Allied forces should continue to station troops in the same places where they are currently stationed, and all taxes shall be waived for the military and their necessary food, clothing, and other supplies. The troops have the right to practice, target shoot, and conduct large-scale field exercises without prior notification, but they should notify us in advance when firing bullets and make every effort to avoid clashes between the troops of the various countries and the Chinese troops. Therefore, the Chinese government intends to prohibit Chinese troops from advancing or stationing within twenty Chinese li of the troops stationed in Tianjin. Tracing back to before the signing of the new treaty, in the official documents exchanged between the ministers of various countries stationed in Beijing and the Chinese plenipotentiary ministers, including the noble prince, it was mutually agreed that officers in charge of the troops along the Beijing-to-sea route should have the right to suppress and punish crimes, extending to a distance of two English miles on both sides of the railway. This should be handled in the same way when troops are stationed in several places mentioned in Article 9 of the Protocol. Although the minister and other ministers stationed in Beijing have agreed that the Zhili governor has the right to station a bodyguard of no more than 300 men in the city of Tianjin, and that the Zhili governor has the right to establish a police force sufficient to maintain peace on the river, even if the river is within two English miles of the railway," etc. Whether this note is valid is a legal question. However, the number of troops and police currently stationed in Tianjin by our country remains the same as before and has not increased, which is also consistent with this. How can the Japanese Consul have demands that go beyond this scope? Furthermore, the Boxer Protocol is a public treaty signed between China and various countries, not a treaty signed solely with Japan. If there is a violation of a public treaty, it should be recognized by all countries and jointly raised by the contracting parties. It cannot be acted upon unilaterally. The Japanese side cannot raise a protest to us unilaterally without the consent of the various countries. Legally, this is illegal, and in fact, it is enough to prove that their argument is unreasonable. Moreover, this matter involves treaty issues, which are different from ordinary local negotiations and cannot be raised by a local consul. Treaties must be observed by both parties. The Japanese army's occupation of Yuguan has completely destroyed the Boxer Protocol. What about the others? The countries requested in the Boxer Protocol to raze the Dagu Forts and all other forts that impede the passage from Beijing to the sea, which implied the opening of the door. The Japanese army's occupation of Yuguan, increasing troops and warships, and threatening Tianjin and Beiping have directly broken the open-door policy. Is this kind of unreasonable behavior directed only at China? Therefore, the authorities are very indignant at the Japanese Consul's unreasonable trouble-making and are currently negotiating based on reason with a very firm attitude.

<p>Remnants of Tang Yulin's troops</p>
<h3>Area Around Tuiji Fenglong</h3>
<p>One Unit Has Already Surrendered to Sun Dianying</p>
<p>Volunteer Troops from Rehe Province Have Retreated to the Border of Chahar</p>
<p>Duolun Dispatch: Since abandoning Rehe, the various armies that have collapsed and retreated to multiple borders, as well as those newly arriving, amount to no less than fifty to sixty thousand. As a result, the various necessities in Duolun are experiencing shortages. The losses suffered by the volunteer troops during the recent battle in Rehe were particularly heavy. Currently, most are still unable to withdraw. Those who have retreated to Duolun include slightly over a thousand men from Feng Zhanhai's unit. In addition, there is the First Division of Yang Zhen's Fifth Route of the National Anti-Japanese Army of Rehe, led by Brigade Commander Li Huanqing, which has now retreated to Sanyuhou Abaomiao. The remaining troops are less than three hundred, a significant loss. Division Commander Liu Pinyi, Brigade Commander Tan Yufang, and Xiao Fengwu are still of unknown whereabouts. Furthermore, Xu Xiyao's unit of the Third Division of the same army has now retreated to the area around Third Mountain and Qipan Mountain, numbering no less than two thousand. They are currently about sixty *li* away from the enemy and more than ten *li* away from Sun Dianying's army, with whom they have established contact. According to the person in charge of this unit, they are waiting for ammunition replenishment and will then contact Sun's army to launch a counterattack against the enemy. However, at present, they are in a dire state of supply, clothing, and ammunition. According to people from Fengning, several units of volunteer troops have also arrived in Fenglong, bearing designations such as the Third, Fifth, and Seventh Routes of the National Anti-Japanese Army of Rehe. The number of troops is unknown. Tang Yulin's remaining troops are also still in the Fenglong area, numbering no less than twenty thousand. It is said that a portion of them have surrendered to Sun Dianying's unit, while the majority are said to be making contact with the National Anti-Japanese Army for consolidation.</p>

<h3>Li Ming Sacrifices His Life Eradicating Communists</h3>
<p>Succumbed to Injuries After Being Heavily Besieged</p>
<p>Thousands Welcome His Coffin Back to the Province</p>
<p>Chen Cheng Requests Commendation and Compensation from the Party and the Nation</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Since the concentration of the Central Route's 123rd Columns of the Communist Eradication Army at designated locations last month, they have advanced southward to suppress the communists. At that time, Zhu and Mao suffered a major defeat in Nanfeng and were planning to devise other schemes. Later, it was discovered that the 52nd and 59th Divisions of the First Column of the government army were concentrated in Huangpi in the southern part of Yihuang County. They were planning to advance from the Bilianshan area bordering Nanfeng, Lean, and Ningdu to the communist nests of Dongshao and Luokou. Zhu and Mao then moved the main forces from the two Nan areas, crossed Yihuang westward, and lay in ambush in the mountains near Huangpi. At the same time, the puppet 21st and 22nd Armies and the Independent 4th and 5th Divisions from the Yongfeng, Lean, Zhaoxie, and Tengtian areas were also ordered by Zhu and Mao to move eastward into Yi to cut off our rear and attack us from both sides. On the 25th of last month, Li Ming, commander of the 52nd Division, led his troops to advance towards Huangpi. On the 26th, they camped at Gugang. The puppet 3rd, 7th, 12th, 21st, and 22nd communist armies, as well as local puppet independent divisions, regiments, and guerrillas, numbering about thirty to forty thousand, with twenty to thirty thousand guns, ambushed in Huangpi and besieged the 52nd Division. Commander Li, finding himself in a perilous terrain surrounded by layers of enemy forces, ordered his officers and soldiers to calmly engage in battle while waiting for reinforcements. Although the officers and soldiers fought bravely and fiercely, the communist forces advanced one after another like moths to a flame. From the evening of the 26th until the 1st of March, for three days and nights, the machine guns and rifles sounded as densely as a string of firecrackers, and the repeated charges were a bloody struggle. During these three days and nights, the officers and soldiers not only did not sleep for a moment but also did not eat a single meal. Commander Li personally charged into the hail of bullets, directing the battle. His left arm was broken by a bullet, and blood flowed profusely. He continued to supervise the battle with his sword. Unfortunately, at the Dengxian Bridge in Gugang, he was shot again in the abdomen and was already dying. However, he still told his subordinates that fighting was the only way to survive and urged them to charge desperately and break through the encirclement. However, trapped in the center of the enemy lines, the communists kept coming in greater numbers. Several communists approached Commander Li, and seeing that he was injured and unable to move, they asked him what his rank was. Li shouted sternly, "I am Li Ming, commander of the 52nd Division!" Fearing that he would be humiliated by the communists, he pulled out his pistol and fired two shots into his chest, thus sacrificing his life for the cause. When the division's reinforcements arrived on the 2nd, they only managed to rescue a portion of the troops. Chief of Staff Liu Shan was also injured, and many officers were killed in action. The sacrifices were self-evident. The division has now withdrawn to Linchuan for reorganization, and Xia Chuzhong has been promoted to division commander, actively replenishing the ranks. As for Li's remains, they have now been discovered by the troops of Li Mo'an and Wu Qiwai near Chongxiang in Nanpi, Yihuang, after taking Huangpi. They were transported to Erdu, Yihuang, for embalming and then escorted to the province by Chief of Staff Liu and Brigade Commander Peng of the division. They arrived in Nanchang on the afternoon of the 23rd, where thousands of representatives from the party, government, and military circles welcomed them at the station, shouting slogans such as "Commander Li's spirit will never die!" and "Avenge Commander Li!" The coffin was then carried to the Guangdong Guild Hall for temporary placement, and a funeral committee was established. A provincial funeral will be held following the precedents of Division Commanders Zhang Hui and Hu Zuyu, who sacrificed their lives in suppressing the communists. Li was from Guixian, Guangxi, and a graduate of the Baoding Military Academy. He joined the army at a young age and made many meritorious contributions during the Northern Expedition, rising from platoon leader to company, battalion, and regimental commander. Last year, he was appointed commander of the 52nd Division and personally led his troops in suppressing the communists in the Yongfeng and Jishui areas. This time, he joined the First Column from Yongfeng and died for his country in Huangpi and Gugang at the age of forty-one. He is survived by his wife, Madam Liu, who is now in the provincial capital, grief-stricken. His sons and daughters are only a few years old and are still studying in Suzhou. Arrangements have been made to bring them to attend the funeral. Li governed his troops with strict discipline and integrity, and his family is extremely impoverished. Commander-in-Chief Chen has reported Li's death to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, and the Military Affairs Commission, requesting commendation and compensation to comfort his loyal soul and encourage others.

<h3>Another Guangdong Plane Crash</h3>
<p>Plane Crashes Into Mountain and Burns During Exercise Due to Fog</p>
<p>Two Pilots Die in the Flames</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: The officers and soldiers of the Guangdong Provincial Army, Navy, and Air Force have recently been volunteering to go north and fight the enemy. The army is ready and waiting for orders, and the air force's squadrons are also on standby. Therefore, the graduating pilots of each class are conducting combat flight exercises day and night in preparation for departure. However, during these exercises, a flight accident occurred again on the morning of the 21st at 8:00 AM. Recently, flight drills have been conducted on a rotational basis. On this morning, pilot Rong Zhongwei of the Fourth Squadron, along with mechanic Chen Jiu, piloted an Avro Atlas fighter plane and took off from the airfield to practice tactics. After about thirty minutes, a thick fog suddenly appeared in the sky, making it impossible to see anything in front of them. It became extremely difficult to fly, and they were forced to descend. A south wind was blowing, so they turned north and then headed south. At this time, the fog had covered the Baiyun Mountain area near Shou Gou Ling, and the peaks were completely obscured. Since the plane was descending with the wind, it crashed into the mountainside of Baiyun Mountain. The plane's fuel tank suffered a violent impact, the tank broke, and the fuel spilled out. The fuselage caught fire, and in an instant, thick smoke rose, and pilot Rong Zhongwei and mechanic Chen Jiu were buried in the flames. Soldiers from the Military and Political School saw smoke rising near the Su Family Cemetery on Baiyun Mountain from a distance and rushed to investigate. They discovered that a plane had crashed and burned and immediately reported it to the Air Force Headquarters. Upon receiving the news, the headquarters immediately dispatched rescue vehicles and medical officers to the scene of the accident for rescue. However, the Avro Atlas plane had been completely burned. Only the upper half of pilot Rong's body remained, and the lower part was charred. Mechanic Chen Jiu had been reduced to ashes, with no bones remaining. The scene was extremely tragic. After collecting the remains, Rong's remains were sent to the Yueguang Company for encoffining. Rong was only twenty-six years old and a graduate of the third class, second division of the Aviation School. He was diligent and conscientious in his work. Now that he has died in the line of duty, the Air Force Headquarters has provided compensation to his family following the precedent for deaths in the line of duty. (March 21)</p>

<h3>Transportation Conference of Five Provinces and Cities</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang Dispatch: The Second Standing Committee Meeting of the Transportation Committees of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Nanjing, and Shanghai was held at the Construction Department yesterday. The attending committee members included Zhao Zukang of the National Economic Council, Bao Naiming of the Nanjing Municipal Government, Tan Boying of the Shanghai Municipal Government, Cao Shouchang of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, Wu Hongzhao of the Anhui Provincial Government, Xu Xingcheng of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, Yao Xunyuan of the Ministry of Interior's Department of Health, Ye Zongqi of the Anhui Construction Department, Wu Jianzhou of the Jiangsu Construction Department, and Zhang Jingcheng. Xu Xingcheng chaired the meeting. The matters discussed included: (1) It was proposed that since large sections of the roadbed of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway are too narrow, making driving dangerous, the association should subsidize half of the widening project and the cost of adding guardrail projects to facilitate progress. The decision was to have the association send a letter to the National Economic Council to submit it for discussion at the Seven-Province Highway Conference. (2) It was proposed that the letters issued by the association to implement the resolutions should be sent directly to the transportation authorities of each province and city for review and handling, in order to simplify procedures and expedite the process. The decision was to continue to handle the matter as before. (3) It was proposed whether the military authorities and garrison troops within each province and city should pay taxes on all vehicles in accordance with regulations, and whether all drivers should apply for driver's licenses from the local government. The decision was that all vehicles belonging to military and political agencies should pay taxes in accordance with regulations, which had already been ordered by the Executive Yuan. The Economic Committee should be asked to submit this case to the Executive Yuan for reaffirmation to maintain transportation administration. (4) It was proposed that the association should print road safety knowledge posters and send them to the education departments of each province for distribution to schools and public education centers for purchase and display, in order to reduce danger. The decision was to approve the principle, and the committee members will collect various materials and submit them to the standing committee for consolidation. The matter should be completed within one month, following the previous case. (5) It was proposed to compile a summary of road traffic regulations. The decision was to approve in principle the draft directory of joint highway traffic management regulations for each province proposed by Committee Members Zhao and He. The original drafters will be asked to work with Committee Members Tan and Xu of Shanghai and Jiangsu to compile and distribute the information in detail. After each committee member signs and comments, it will be submitted for discussion at the next meeting. (6) It was proposed to standardize the design of temporary vehicle license plates. The decision was to abolish temporary vehicle license plates. The collection of vehicle donations in each province and city should be based on quarterly collection in principle. However, if a taxpayer applies for a license more than one month after the start of a quarter, one month's donation may be reduced; if the application is made more than two months after the start of a quarter, two months' donation may be reduced; however, at least one month's donation should be collected and cannot be calculated on a daily basis. (7) It was proposed that since the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway Minhang Ferry Management Office lacks funds, the association should allocate funds from the mutual automobile surcharge funds of the five provinces and cities on a monthly basis to maintain it. The decision was to ask the National Economic Council to temporarily borrow funds until the end of the year, with the future income of the new ferry as collateral. (8) It was proposed that the traffic conditions of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway are of concern to both Chinese and foreigners. How should the road maintenance, security matters, and all transportation facilities of the Hangzhou-Minhang section, which are under the jurisdiction of the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, be unified in authority to achieve practical results? The decision was to ask the Economic Committee to send a letter to the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to discuss and handle the matter together. (26th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Bandits Arrested in Hotel</p>
<p>Yang Shijie, an inspector from the Public Security Bureau, arrested a bandit in the Central Hotel yesterday. (The names of the remaining bandits are being withheld pending arrest.) He was a member of a gang that kidnapped a person surnamed Mou and had just arrived in Songjiang that day to extort money from the Mou family. He was spotted by an informant.

<h3>Graduation Ceremony at the Tax Police Training Institute</h3>

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Unified Collection and Management of Airplane Donation Funds</p>
<p>The people of Wuxi, in view of the pressing national crisis, have been enthusiastic in donating funds for aviation to save the country. However, since the efforts are being carried out separately, it is difficult to make statistics and supervision, so there is a need to establish a general organization in the county. This was raised at the last party-government meeting, and it was decided that the guiding principle for raising funds for aviation to save the country would be for all sectors to proceed separately, either by occupation, organization, or region, each organizing an aviation salvation association to be responsible for the efforts. The county government, county party headquarters, and county chamber of commerce would jointly organize a board of directors to be responsible for supervision. While this was in progress, the central government re-stipulated the organizational outline of the Airplane Donation Fund Collection and Management Committee, ordering all provinces, cities, and counties to comply. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Chen believed that this regulation was the same as the decision made at the party-government meeting in Wuxi, so he sent letters to the county party headquarters and county chamber of commerce, ordering them to establish the committee by a certain date. The county party headquarters has already nominated Ben Tiping to participate, and the county chamber of commerce has also nominated personnel and replied to the county government. The announcement of the establishment will be made soon, and the committee's address will be located within the county government. In the future, all airplane donations from all sectors in Wuxi must be reported to the committee.</p>

<p>Minsheng Factory Imports Large Quantity of Japanese Yarn</p>
<p>The Minsheng Socks Factory in this city, managed by Zhu Yushu, suddenly had a merchant secretly report to the Anti-Japanese Association when a Shanghai ship entered the port with the night shift the other day that the ship was privately carrying a large quantity of Japanese yarn, all of which was purchased by the Minsheng Socks Factory. It was also said that the factory had repeatedly smuggled in yarn, but had repeatedly escaped detection due to careful planning. The Anti-Japanese Association then sent inspectors Yang Shiming and others to search the ship and found ten bags of Japanese yarn. They also learned that the amount imported was not limited to this number, so they sent personnel to the Minsheng Socks Factory for inspection and found another thirty bags of the same Japanese yarn. All of them were then sent to the Anti-Japanese Association for handling. It is reported that the Anti-Japanese Association will severely punish the factory as a warning to those who say one thing and mean another and have no conscience.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Taoist Deceived Due to Lust</p>
<p>In the Xiaguan area of Yuyao, there is a Taoist priest named Wuzhen who is lustful and wealthy. A monk named Tikong, who lived in the same place, saw that Wuzhen was lustful and colluded with Song Yingshi, a ruffian in the area. They ordered Shuang Tongshi Jiangfu to dress up as a woman and invite Wuzhen to drink. When Wuzhen saw Shi Jiangfu's beautiful appearance, he was so captivated by her beauty that he was willing to pay 200 yuan to marry Shi. After the two sides agreed, they married Shi Jiangfu on the 9th of this month. However, just as Wuzhen and Shi Jiangfu were about to enter the bridal chamber after kowtowing to heaven and earth, a wealthy man in the area died of illness and asked Wuzhen to chant scriptures for encoffining. Wuzhen believed that chanting scriptures for encoffining was urgent and that there was a large profit to be gained, so he left his bride and went away, instructing his niece, Zhao Meixia, to sleep with the bride. As a result, Shi Jiangfu defiled Zhao Meixia. When Wuzhen returned home after finishing his business and wanted to share the bed with his bride, Shi refused on the pretext of menstruation and continued to sleep with his niece, Meixia. Later, when Shi went to urinate, Wuzhen's sister, Yuegu, caught a glimpse of the truth and revealed the deception. They went to look for Tikong, but he had already fled. Wuzhen then dragged Shi to the authorities for investigation. This kind of trickery is unprecedented in the countryside.</p>

<p>Zhou Zhen, a doctor from the Shanghai Infectious Disease Hospital, said:</p>
<h3>Rescue of the King's Retinue</h3>
<p>The Spirit of the People in the North Has Not Died</p>
<p>Unwilling to Be Slaves of a Fallen Nation</p>
<p>Three individuals, namely Zhou Zhen, a doctor from the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Tibet Road in this city, along with his assistant Mao Zhenbang, and pharmacist Li Daolu, departed for Vladivostok on the 26th of last month. Their mission was to provide medical assistance to the dependents of Wang Delin, Su Bingwen, Ma Zhanshan, and Li Du, as well as other refugees who were returning to Shanghai from Russia. Dr. Zhou's thorough and comprehensive care along the way allowed thousands of men, women, old, and young to return to their country safely. Dr. Zhou's contribution was truly remarkable. After the arrival of the Wu Yang Steamer in Qingdao on the 24th, Dr. Zhou took another ship to travel to Shanghai ahead of the others, arriving in port the day before yesterday. A reporter from the Daba Society specifically visited Dr. Zhou at the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital yesterday to inquire about the journey. Dr. Zhou provided the following detailed account:</p>
<p>Serving in the North: Dr. Zhou stated that upon hearing that the dependents of Wang Delin, Ma Zhanshan, Su Bingwen, and Li Du had returned from Russia, the chairman of the hospital board, Liu Hongsheng, instructed that someone be sent to care for and treat them. He, along with his assistant Mao Zhenbang and pharmacist Li Daozhong, embarked on the government-assigned Wu Yang Steamer on the 16th of last month, heading north to provide medical care along the way and fulfill a national duty to save the country. On the evening of the 25th, while the ship was en route, the severe cold caused the river to freeze solid, preventing passage. They, along with the ship's captain, broke the ice, and finally arrived in Vladivostok on March 1st. They received the support and hospitality of Xu, our country's Consul-General in Russia, and enjoyed significant convenience.</p>
<p>Boarding in Batches: The Russian government designated Vladivostok as a neutral zone, prohibiting our volunteer army from passing through its territory to avoid destruction. Therefore, the righteous soldiers detoured to Xinjiang to return to their country. On March 4th, the first group of 188 dependents of Wang Delin's troops arrived in Vladivostok and boarded the ship. Wang's wife also arrived at the ship at the same time. Among them were 22 wounded righteous soldiers. At 4:00 PM on the 7th, 1,314 dependents of Su Bingwen, Ma Zhanshan, and Li Du's troops also arrived in Vladivostok from Moscow, transported in 46 train carriages. Among them were 211 officers and righteous soldiers. These victims had been en route for a total of 18 days, suffering from cold and hunger, and enduring immense hardship. Eleven of them were left behind after getting off the train to buy food, and later two managed to catch up, while the whereabouts of the rest remain unknown. When the second group arrived in Vladivostok, Ren Zuotian, the head of Ma's propaganda team, and over 30 others organized a transportation team. The team members were all young and strong, allowing them to move over 500 pieces of luggage belonging to the dependents in a very short time. The organization was excellent.</p>
<p>Conditions En Route: The Wu Yang Steamer set sail southward at 11:00 PM on the 9th. On the first day of the voyage, the two groups of dependents, having gone without food for two days, rushed to grab the lunch. Order was restored only after the food was distributed. On the 15th, they arrived at Dagu Port, and on the 16th at 9:00 AM, they reached Tanggu. Representatives from all sectors of Tianjin came to welcome them and provide comfort supplies. The dependents of Su, Ma, Li, and Mao, as well as Wang Delin's and Li Du's wives, disembarked at 10:00 AM to go to Tianjin via Ping. Yu Xuezhong and others welcomed them at the Tianjin Railway Station. The 158 dependents of Wang Delin remained on the original ship to come to Shanghai. They left Tanggu on the afternoon of the 18th, arrived in Yantai on the 19th, and reached Qingdao on the evening of the 21st. On the 23rd, they approached Jiaozhou Bay. Representatives from all sectors of Qingdao boarded the ship on the morning of the 20th to offer comfort, giving each person candy and bread. The ship sailed at 7:00 PM on the 24th and arrived in port at 3:00 PM today (the 26th).</p>
<p>Medical Treatment: Their trip was entirely focused on ensuring sanitation along the way. Upon disembarking, eight people had measles, and four had scarlet fever. These twelve were not allowed to board the ship because these diseases are highly contagious, and public safety had to be considered. They were sent to isolation hospitals for treatment, and Consul Xu was asked to take responsibility for sending them back to their country. They set up an office on the ship, providing scheduled medical consultations from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM, as well as regularly checking on the conditions of the dependents. They treated 196 internal medicine patients, 113 surgical patients, and 9 ophthalmology patients, for a total of 318 people. They dispensed medicine over 2,000 times. One child died, one person contracted scarlet fever, and two suffered from acute illnesses. All the medicine they had brought, enough for 600 people, had been used up.</p>
<p>Thoughts on the Trip: During this month-long trip, they witnessed the suffering of compatriots in distress, especially the fact that the righteous soldiers in Vladivostok were not allowed to pass through, which gave them a profound lesson. The entire nation must rise up as one. Ren Zuotian, the head of Ma's propaganda team who came south this time, will be heading north again soon to join the resistance against Japan. The Chinese staff on the Chinese Eastern Railway, even under the iron heel of the Japanese army, are willing to seize the opportunity to escape and return to their country. Therefore, the spirit of the people in the North has not declined. The dependents who arrived in Shanghai today are sacrificing themselves for the country, and it is hoped that all sectors of society will provide relief and assistance, etc.</p>
<p>Chen Youren's Discussion</p>
<h3>The United States Should Assist China</h3>
<p>Based on the Obligations and Responsibilities of the United States</p>
<p>Divided into Four Points: Military, Legal, Economic, and International</p>
<p>Former Foreign Minister Chen Youren made the following statement yesterday: Since the League of Nations has failed to resolve the conflict arising from Japan's aggression against China, the world's attention is now focused on the task of the United States. This task has been bestowed upon the United States by historically created circumstances. The international situation in the Far East is partly built on the foundations of the Open Door Policy and the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the United States is the main element of this foundation. The Open Door Policy was developed by American politicians and instilled into the political thinking of the great powers, and the Nine-Power and Kellogg-Briand Pacts were largely conceived and produced by the American political psychology. Now that Japan is trying to destroy this international situation by force, the United States naturally has a responsibility to lead other countries in preventing it. The reasons why the United States should intervene in the Sino-Japanese dispute can be summarized into four categories: (1) military situation, (2) legal aspects, (3) economic aspects, and (4) international aspects.</p>
<h3>Military Aspects</h3>
<p>First, in terms of the military situation, this arises from Japan's Manchurian theory. The Japanese have cited three reasons, claiming that Manchuria is their lifeline: (1) a source of raw materials, (2) a shield against the southward advance of Soviet Russia's forces, and (3) a place to accommodate Japan's surplus population. Regarding the first reason, China's answer is that Japan can purchase all the raw materials it needs in Manchuria through normal international trade channels, just as the United States and other countries do when they need foreign raw materials. As for the red terror alleged by the Japanese, in view of Soviet Russia's actual policy towards Manchuria, it is difficult to become a major reason. Since the declarations of 1919 and 1920, Soviet Russia has not only verbally but also in fact abandoned the Tsarist Russia's policy of invading Manchuria's territory. If it dares to say that the revolutionary leadership of the Kuomintang was not delayed in 1927, then the recovery of all Soviet Russian rights in northern Manchuria would be a fait accompli today. Even the various rights in southern Manchuria, if they could be detached from the Japanese grasp in 1905 and remain in the hands of Tsarist Russia, it would be equally not an entirely unfounded delusion that they could be recovered at this time. As for the absorption of Japan's surplus population, according to Japan's attempts to emigrate to Manchuria, none have been successful to date. It seems that the people of that island nation are physically or psychologically unable to permanently live in mainland areas far from the ocean, such as Manchuria. There may be other places in China where the Japanese can live and reproduce, especially in the coastal provinces of Shandong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang. However, they are already overcrowded. Although there are other paradises, such as the western coast of the United States and Canada and the vast lands of Australia, these are places where the Japanese can cultivate. However, the Japanese cannot gain access to these white lands until Japan's naval forces hold the hegemony in the Pacific Ocean. To create this naval hegemony, it is necessary to eliminate the United States' naval forces in the Pacific Ocean first. For this reason, coupled with the United States' refusal to compromise on the demand for racial equality, the Japanese have become increasingly indignant, causing their military thinking to be dominated by the idea that Japan and the United States are inevitably bound to have a third "life-or-death war." The Japanese General Staff Headquarters is planning and preparing for this war just as it prepared for the first "life-or-death war" against China between 1894 and 1895 and the second "life-or-death war" against Russia between 1904 and 1905. The main preparation for the second "life-or-death war" was the conclusion of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. Although this alliance has been abolished, it continues to be the criterion for British decisions on Japanese policy. In the Japanese preparations for this third great war, its difficult diplomatic task lies in maintaining the spirit of this alliance to hinder any attempt by the United States and British navies to unite in the Far East. The Japanese fear nothing more than the union of the British and American navies as a medium for international sanctions and pressure. This is why Australia and New Zealand have never been included in the dictionaries of their propagandists in the clamor for a place to accommodate surplus population. However, Japan still has a formidable and blatant expression of war preparations, which is its current conquest of China. This movement began when it planned to occupy the whole of Manchuria and took genuine hostile action against the official Chinese army to invade Rehe. China has now become the object and tool of the Japanese General Staff Headquarters' conquest plan since September 18th. China's raw materials and markets are indispensable for the Japanese determination to compete with another island nation (referring to the British) for world hegemony. In order to make China a market for absorbing Japanese factory products forever, it is necessary to take advantage of the fact that China has not yet industrialized and for the Japanese to monopolize the dominant power over all products that can compete with Japanese goods. Furthermore, for Japan, a conquered China can be used as a tool for fighting the United States, because controlling and using China's material and human resources, and occupying China's key military locations, will be equally important in a Japanese-American war.</p>
<h3>Legal Aspects</h3>
<p>Secondly, in terms of legal aspects, President Roosevelt declared in his inaugural address, "In world policy, I wish to dedicate this country to a policy of resolving to respect treaty obligations and sacred good neighborliness." Now that Japan has agreed with the United States and other signatory countries in the Nine-Power Treaty to respect China's territorial sovereignty and administrative integrity, and has also agreed with the United States and other signatory countries in the Kellogg-Briand Pact not to use war as an instrument of national policy, these two treaties, both of which arose from the United States' wishes and political skills, can be regarded as contracts of the United States. Japan's violations of the two treaties have become an intolerable act of violence against the United States and the rest of the civilized world represented by the League of Nations, and have been clearly demonstrated and need not be described in detail. Moreover, Japan has used force to occupy and divide a large area of Chinese territory, which is nearly three times the size of Japan itself, and the Chinese people living there are equal to half of Japan's population. It then uses the excuse of lifeline as a reason for invading Manchuria, as if it wants to reveal to the world that Japan has used force (that is, war) as an instrument of national policy to ridicule them. China has now submitted the situation created by Japan's forceful occupation of Manchuria and Rehe, which is intended to exploit the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, to the world for public judgment. As a result, for the sake of the nation's honor and credibility, the United States should take measures to compel Japan to decide to respect its treaty obligations and sacredness.</p>
<h3>Economic Aspects</h3>
<p>Moreover, in terms of economic aspects, the same conclusion as the previous two aspects can be obtained. As mentioned above, the Open Door Policy in China is the United States' concept and also the United States' contribution to international security in the corner of the Far East. If in the era of John Hay, when the United States was prosperous and had not yet relied heavily on foreign exports, it was necessary to maintain this doctrine, then today, the prosperity of the United States and the living standards of the American people cannot rely solely on domestic consumption. The machines produce and rely on foreign sales, and the surplus manufactured products must maintain the Open Door Policy. If this is the case, then the Chinese market can be considered indispensable to the machine age of the United States. Moreover, the United States' adoption of a policy of maintaining goodwill towards China is a kind of "investment." After Japan's destructive activities in China are settled, when the purchasing power of the Chinese people increases, American businessmen will have huge gains, which cannot be expected from forceful oppression and gunboat policies. Therefore, there is even more reason not to give up the Chinese market.</p>
<h3>International Aspects</h3>
<p>Furthermore, in terms of international aspects, if we discuss the responsibility of the United States to fulfill the obligations and promises in the two treaties after Japan's violation of the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, it will be clear. Even if China does not want to ask the United States to go to war with Japan at this time, according to these two treaties, it has the right to ask the United States: (A) whether it is bound by the articles and obligations of these two treaties; (B) if so, how will it assist China to make the Japanese abide by the treaties. Apart from material assistance that does not lead to war, the United States has the power and qualifications to firmly intervene in the Sino-Japanese dispute to uphold the treaty. The United States has this kind of power in war debts. Whether the United Kingdom, France, and other European countries are able to pay these war debts, unconditionally canceling them will be useless and harmful to the United States. Unconditional cancellation will not bring about the prosperity of the United States or restore the world's economy. The economic downturn that the United States and the world are suffering from is only a precursor to a great revolution to reorganize the existing order in society. The French Revolution opened a new era in history and eventually achieved personal political security and the rise of nationalism. The revolution that is now unfolding before us will achieve personal economic security and international security among countries. This theory is not within the scope of this article and will not be described in detail here. However, it must be known that we are now almost at the gate of the world's new order. If we want this new order to be realized without bloodshed or violence, then in addition to other economic and social conditions, we must maintain universal peace throughout the world. However, maintaining world peace cannot be achieved without reducing armaments. Even the so-called spiritual disarmament can have the same importance, and the reduction of naval and land armaments is of paramount importance. However, when it comes to disarmament, in addition to purely European difficulties such as security, equality of status, and amendment of boundaries, if there is another major world power such as Japan that nakedly expresses its ruling class, morally no different from barbarians holding machine guns, then disarmament will never be possible. We have searched through ancient and modern history and have never seen a great power so barbaric, so uninhibited, and so lacking in a sense of responsibility that distinguishes humans from animals. Therefore, the United States has the right and the responsibility to demand that the United Kingdom, France, and the United States cooperate to first assist China in forcing Japan to abide by the Nine-Power Treaty, and secondly to implement universal disarmament, ensuring that the scope and method of the disarmament can achieve international security not only among European countries and the United States, but also among various countries and peoples in the Far East and Japan. Taking this move as an exchange for the cancellation of war debts will completely disarm Japan, which is a condition in the disarmament system produced by the civilized psychology and is essential for those who want a higher organization of national life and work. This is more urgent than France's reduction of its land army and the United Kingdom's reduction of its navy. It cannot be said that there is genuine peace if the United Kingdom and France do not reduce their armaments. However, these countries are genuine modern countries with a broad foundation built on democracy and freedom. Their use of great authority is entirely based on reason and is never as uninhibited as the Japanese. Therefore, they can usually be trusted like the United States. Japan has gained naval superiority in the Far East through the naval resolutions of the Washington Conference. At present, neither the United Kingdom nor the United States alone can initiate a war with it in the Far East. This fact, coupled with the characteristics of the genuine Japanese government, has allowed the Japanese to dare to tear up the two major treaties created by American political skills, forcefully occupy China's richest region, and begin to provoke the member states of the League of Nations without fear of punishment. The genuine government of Japan is not the cabinet whose spokesman is currently the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but its General Staff Headquarters. When we read Japanese history, we often think that the Meiji Restoration of 1867 has ended the shogunate, the ruling machine of the feudal era. In fact, it has never eliminated the shogunate, but only changed the people, replacing Tokugawa with the Choshu and Satsuma clans, and moving the shogunate to the General Staff Headquarters. Therefore, the "modern Japan" claimed by Japanese propagandists continues to be ruled by this feudal machine-transformed shogunate. Examining modern history, there is no more terrible special phenomenon than Japan. Since then, "modern Japan" has jumped to become one of the world's great powers with the help of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, and has used this alliance as a tool for ambitious policies. As a result, it defeated Tsarist Russia and set foot in Manchuria, the fertile land of China, and further annexed Korea. Without the material and spiritual assistance of the United Kingdom, Japan would hardly be able to join the ranks of the great powers, and today it would not have become a danger to China, the United States, and even the British Empire in the end.</p>
<p>Based on the foregoing views, for the important interests of the United States government and people, it is necessary to automatically and actively intervene in the conflict arising from Japan's armed invasion of China, so as to first fulfill its obligations to China guaranteed in the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and to protect its honor and credibility, and secondly to protect its national security and stability and prevent Japan from gaining naval superiority in the Pacific Ocean, and thirdly to restore the prosperity of the United States. Only after Japan's effective disarmament, followed by the universal disarmament of other powers, and the maintenance of world peace, can the United States see its prosperity again. It is not difficult for the United States to use war debts to achieve this kind of change in national policy direction. In this period of great world change, the war debt issue is not only an economic weapon in the hands of the United States government, but can also be used as a tool for great policies to wisely resolve the current disputes among countries and create a new environment. We know that this move does involve the development of American policy and seems to run counter to Washington's narrow policy of warning the people not to get involved in the disputes of other countries. However, if a foreigner (that is, a Chinese) recites the great declaration of the Democratic Party under the leadership of the Wilson faction and solemnly declares that the future of the United States can become a great world power, making its influence reach everywhere humans set foot, so that civilized society will not disappear from the earth, I hope the American people will also allow it.</p>
<p>Zang Qifang at the Northeast Association</p>
<h3>Speaking on the Future of the Northeast Issue</h3>
<p>Automatic Warfare is Needed, Active Warfare is Needed</p>
<p>Peace and Delay are Not Solutions</p>
<p>The Northeast Association of this city invited Zang Qifang to speak on the future of the Northeast issue at the YMCA in Baxianqiao at 7:00 PM the day before yesterday. The record of his speech is as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, what I want to talk about today is still the Northeast issue. I have spoken here before about the situation in the Northeast after the September 18th Incident. Some of you must have heard it. The manuscript of the speech has been published in the newspaper. Those who were not present that day can probably see it. What I am talking about today is the future of the Northeast issue. When I spoke last time, the Northeast had been lost, but Rehe had not yet been lost. Therefore, the conclusion at that time was "The lost land must never be recognized as lost, continue to encourage the people to strive for struggle, and the land that has not been lost must resist desperately and defend desperately." Today, when I speak,</p>
<h3>Rehe Has Been Lost Again</h3>
<p>After Rehe was lost, the entire Hebei Province is in danger of being lost, and the two provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan are also in danger of being lost. Japan's attack on China has two routes, one is the southward policy and the other is the westward policy. The southward is to take Pingjin and take the entire Hebei Province. The westward is to attack Dolun first from Rehe, and then attack Zhangjiakou in Chahar Province to invade Chahar and Suiyuan. Now, is Japan going south to take Hebei or west to take Chahar and Suiyuan? We certainly dare not say for sure, but according to the military and diplomatic convenience of the Japanese side, there is a tendency to go west. I often think about this problem this way, and perhaps some people do not agree. Because Japan has already occupied Yuguan and Rehe, and is advancing towards Pingjin from ports such as Luodong and Gubeikou Xifeng,</p>
<h3>As Easy as Reaching into a Bag</h3>
<p>So why attack Chahar and Suiyuan to the west? However, I believe that the Japanese army will attack Chahar and Suiyuan to the west first for three reasons: (1) Before attacking Rehe and after occupying Rehe, the Japanese have repeatedly stated that the Great Wall is the boundary, and Pingjin and Beining Road have commercial interests with the United Kingdom and other countries. Invading Chahar and Suiyuan, like Rehe, will not have any international repercussions. Attacking Pingjin is afraid of causing international disputes. This is the first point. (2) The Japanese army's strategy of attack is to attack wherever it is easy. At present, we have heavy troops defending Pingjin, and if they attack, we will resist desperately. Their sacrifices must be very great. In Chahar Province, our troop deployment is not as good as Pingjin. If they use the troops that invaded Rehe to attack Chahar and Suiyuan to the west, the sacrifices will be very small. (3) If the Japanese invade westward from Rehe, and if our troops are weak, it will be like entering an uninhabited area. After taking Chahar and Suiyuan, it will be very important to use it to control Mongolia and deal with Soviet Russia. This is the third point. Therefore, we should pay attention to the two places of Pingjin. I said</p>
<h3>Special Attention Should be Paid</h3>
<p>And to guard it with heavy troops. Moreover, now that things have come to this, it is not just a question of guarding. Since the September 18th Incident, the Japanese's methods have been very simple, that is, to take an inch and advance an inch, to take a foot and advance a foot. The chaos in our country's domestic politics and the disorganization of the people's organizations are very clear to the Japanese side. Therefore, they used all their strength to occupy Manchuria and even attempted to occupy Mongolia. If Manchuria and Mongolia are in their hands, as long as they spend three to five years to reorganize Manchuria and Mongolia, they will feel that all countries in the world will bow their heads and obey their orders, and no one will dare to resist. They even want to annex the entire China in order to establish their Greater Asia Doctrine and achieve the goal of building a country on the mainland. Moreover, they have never taken China's chaotic and unbearable situation to heart, and they are unilaterally waging war without a declaration of war, and they do not negotiate with us at all. After occupying a piece of land, they allow it to be reorganized for one or two months before attacking another piece of our land. This method of taking an inch and advancing an inch, taking a foot and advancing a foot, is consistent. Now that Rehe has been lost, what kind of method should our country adopt for the Northeast issue?</p>
<h3>Speaking of Diplomatic Policy</h3>
<p>There are only two ways, peace and war. Domestic public opinion advocates that war is inevitable. Japan is using the method of waging war without a declaration of war to invade us, and we should also use the method of waging war without a declaration of war to counterattack. We should also have a complete combat plan and should not conduct local operations. They come to fight us, we fight, and if they do not come to fight us, we will also fight. We must fight automatically and actively. The government should advocate this and implement it, and the people should also urge and actively assist. However, even now, all parties in and out of the government still advocate peace. They take many idioms and many reasons to explain the reasons why we should make peace, such as "sleeping on firewood and tasting gall," "ten years of reproduction, ten years of teaching," "things must rot before worms grow," and "not repairing domestic affairs first is not enough to talk about foreign affairs." These kinds of maxims do not seem to be without reason. However, in my opinion, our Chinese nation is simply not worthy to talk about these words, because now the hearts of the general public have been corrupted to an irreparable extent. We must first deal with foreign affairs before there is a way out. If this is not the case, it will be difficult for the Chinese nation to find a way out. I am not just acting out of emotional impulse, but a conclusion reached from deep observation. Some people, we usually admire their morality and writing, but every time they speak, they always discuss the two issues of peace and war, "It is good to be able to fight, and it is also good to be able to make peace." We cannot agree with this kind of words. Now is the time for</p>
<h3>A Life of Ease Cannot Ensure Survival</h3>
<p>If one still believes that "peace" is worth considering, that is simply too pathetic. Our nation, finding itself in a situation where it should neither seek peace nor is able to wage war, has adopted a policy of "delay." This can be said to be a new invention. From the September 18th Incident until now, the delay continues, and it seems it will continue in the future. Truly, no other nation besides China could come up with such a thing. Speaking of this is deeply painful. In this process of delay, there have been local battles and local attempts at peace, which is particularly strange. The battle at Jiangqiao occurred while compromise was being sought in Jinzhou; the battle in Shanghai occurred while no troops were sent to Shanhaiguan. Now, Japan has occupied Rehe, and yet diplomatic relations between China and Japan still exist. Such a method of neither seeking peace nor being able to wage war, but simply using delay, is truly not a proper way out. The reasons for resorting to delay, we can imagine, are that the entire nation, from top to bottom, suffers from two problems: (1) Most people only know about their own small selves and do not know about the greater self. They do not realize that if the greater self does not exist, where will the small self have any room to exist? If the entire nation does not break down the concept of the small self and work for the existence of the greater self, but continues to prioritize oneself before the nation, the country will never be good. (2) The general public only knows how to blame others and does not know how to blame themselves. In reality, one should examine one's own actions. People in various places often criticize the ineffectiveness of resisting goods and the failures of military affairs, speaking with great eloquence. Even if this attitude is not wrong, I hope that those in positions of power and authority should</p>
<h3>Have Profound Awareness</h3>
<p>As long as you do your job truly, you don't need to blame others, and you don't need to be afraid of what others may say about you. For example, if people should not buy Japanese goods, then they should not buy Japanese goods. If the people leading the troops should fight to the death with the Japanese army, then they should fight to the death with the Japanese army. Otherwise, I say you don't do it, you say he doesn't do it, and in the end, no one does anything. We can only watch as the national crisis becomes more serious day by day. The reason why the Chinese people cannot break down their petty selfishness and are prone to blaming others while failing to blame themselves is not without cause. In my view, although the entire nation talks about the national crisis every day, very few people can see the national crisis as extremely serious, feeling that it is more important than anything else. Precisely because they see the national crisis as less important than their own affairs and believe that recovering the Northeast is not easy, they would rather first rectify internal affairs. This is why they make the mistake of failing to break down their petty selfishness and of blaming others while failing to blame themselves. If everyone truly knew that failing to recover the Northeast and Rehe and allowing Japan to govern there for three to five years would mean that the entire China could be annexed by Japan, then everyone would have a more profound awareness. I believe that if Japan takes hold of the Northeast and Rehe, it will not take three to five years</p>
<h3>To Annex China</h3>
<p>Economically speaking, looking at the economic position of the Northeast in terms of forests, minerals, and transportation, no part of China can compare. Take any region in the southwest, northwest, southeast, or central part of our country, and none is as important as the Northeast. Looking at the whole country, imports exceed exports, while in the Northeast, exports exceed imports. It accounts for one-third of the country's export value. The Northeast has always been known for its vast land and abundant resources, with a sparse population. If we allow Japan to use three to five years to develop it with new methods, the resources of the Northeast will not only be able to annex China but can even make all the world's powers bow in obedience. Furthermore, if we do not resist Japan now, who can guarantee that China will not have internal wars? Resisting Japan can actually reduce the chaos of internal wars. It is dangerous that the Chinese people cannot see this principle clearly and thoroughly. On the 17th of this month, the Northeast Association sent out a nationwide telegram, advocating two points: one is to actively counterattack Rehe, and the other is to instigate the Northeast Volunteer Army. After the September 18th Incident, the Japanese who went to the Northeast thought they could move the gold of the Northeast to their islands. However, after a year and a half, the Volunteer Army was destroying everything. Not only were they unable to move the gold of the Northeast, but they also had to take money out to maintain it. The poor economic situation in Japan is also a result of this. If our entire nation can actively resist Japan and instigate the Northeast Volunteer Army, the internal collapse of Japan</p>
<h3>Is Something That Can Be Expected Soon</h3>
<p>In summary, neither "peace" nor "delay" is effective. We should resolutely advocate for war. Currently, the work of the Northeast Association is based on this kind of advocacy, moving forward actively, and requesting assistance from all sectors. Only by doing this ourselves can we urge the government to act. A good government is one that can heed public opinion and lead the people to actively resist Japan. Good citizens are those who can start with themselves and then use all their strength to urge the government to act. Otherwise, how can we talk about national revival? What I have said today may be a bit impassioned. I hope that fellow compatriots from all walks of life will be even more generous and enthusiastic than I am.</p>

(4) Produce and distribute promotional materials to various factories.</p>
<h3>Temporary Proposals</h3>
<p>After the discussion, Gong Yuting, representative of the 7th District Cotton Weaving Labor Union, proposed that the labor-management dispute at the San You Factory has been unresolved for years. Although a legal judgment has been made, the workers are on the verge of destitution. Therefore, he requested assistance from various labor unions. It was resolved that (A) each labor union should donate as much as possible, and (B) each labor union should jointly submit a petition to the Municipal Government for compulsory execution, and Zhu Xuefan, Ye Xianggao, Shao Xubai, Li Yongxiang, Zhou Xuexiang, Long Peiyun, and Yuan Zhaoxin were elected as representatives for the petition. (2) How should the Zhen Tai Factory case be addressed? It was resolved to handle it together with item (B) above.</p>

<h3>Chairman's Address</h3>
<p>During the meeting, the chairman delivered an address, saying, "Fellow comrades, the guests today are either prominent figures in industry and commerce or leaders from various places. I am fortunate to have this opportunity to sit together with you and discuss the major plan of resisting Japan and saving the country. It can be said that this is a rare and fortunate encounter. At this moment, we are facing a major national crisis. First, we must ask ourselves, from the standpoint of the people, whether we are workers, merchants, or in other professions, do we want to save the country? Second, if we want to save the country, how can we save the country in the current urgent and serious situation? I have carefully considered these two points, and the following phenomenon has emerged in the current situation in China. In terms of the people, there is a lack of unity, so the various organizations cannot be sufficiently strong. In terms of politics, the division of powers is too fragmented, so the central force cannot be generated to cope with this special crisis. However, adversity builds the nation. There is this lesson from ancient times. A nation must be able to find a way to save itself only when its position and circumstances have reached a point of extreme oppression and desperation. The situation in China is exactly like this. From a positive perspective, it can be said that this is not a sign of national demise but a harbinger of national revival. The members of our association have asked ourselves that in such a serious time in China, we must do some work to save the country. Therefore, a few days ago, after everyone gathered to discuss, we decided on a draft telegram to the Central Government, advocating that the Central Government transform the current government into a wartime organization, concentrate powers, and control military, economic, and transportation affairs to facilitate the overall external resistance. However, from our own standpoint, the Chinese Industrial Federation is purely an industrial group. This type of national salvation work and planning is of great importance and cannot be undertaken by local organizational forces alone. Therefore, I am specially inviting various public organizations again tonight and the next two days, and at the same time, I will present this draft proposal to the guests present, asking everyone to seriously discuss and vote on it, and also ask the guests present to elect a chairman to preside over tonight's meeting."</p>
<h3>Results of Discussion</h3>
<p>Subsequently, after immediate discussion by various organizations, they adopted the principle of waiting for the Chinese Industrial Federation to first host various public organizations on Monday next week, and then schedule another tea party to jointly decide on the final steps to make strong recommendations to the government.</p>
<h3>Key Points of the Proposal</h3>
<p>The association decided to hold a general meeting after hosting various public organizations on the 28th and 29th to pass a proposal to the Central Government to transform the government into a wartime organization, recommending (1) advocating the control of military power, appointing a person in charge, training a strong army, and implementing a national military preparedness plan to defend against the enemy, (2) the central government should make overall plans to organize wartime financial institutions outside the wartime government to control the national economy, (3) organize military transportation agencies to control national transportation.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Returned to Nanjing Yesterday</h3>

<p>Chiang Tso-pin and Zhu Jiahua Traveled Together</p>
<p>Finance Minister Song Ziwen resolutely resigned as acting president of the Executive Yuan the day before yesterday and came to Shanghai for recuperation. Now, since Wang Jingwei has returned to Nanjing, he may be allowed to resume his position. At the same time, Military Affairs Committee Chairman Chiang also telegraphed Song from Nanjing, requesting him to discuss military expenses. Therefore, Song took the night train to Nanjing at 11:30 PM yesterday to meet with Military Affairs Committee Chairman Chiang. In addition, Ambassador to Japan Chiang Tso-pin and Transportation Minister Zhu Jiahua also traveled to Nanjing on the same train.</p>
<p>San You Factory</p>
<h3>Labor Dispute Resolved</h3>
<p>Execution of the Ruling in Accordance with the Amended Law</p>
<p>Municipal Government Orders the Social Affairs Bureau to Comply</p>
<p>The labor-management dispute at San You Industrial Society has been unresolved for more than a year since the arbitration ruling, due to the employer's declaration of dissent and appeal to the court. Now that the Law on the Handling of Labor Disputes has been amended, in accordance with the provisions of Article 44, Paragraph 2 of the law, the San You case, which has not yet been resolved, should also be handled in accordance with the amended law. That is, the arbitration ruling should have binding force and can be executed in accordance with the law. After the Municipal Government received instructions from the Executive Yuan, it ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to verify and handle it yesterday. It is heard that the bureau has ordered the 7th District Cotton Weaving Industry Labor Union to comply. The original order is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Order The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau issued Order No. 9731 yesterday, ordering the 7th District Cotton Weaving Industry Labor Union, stating, "For the matter of complying with orders, the Municipal Government Order No. 4896 stated, 'The Executive Yuan Order No. 1104 stated, The Municipal Government's telegram requesting instructions on whether the labor-management dispute at San You Industrial should be compulsorily executed in accordance with the Amended Law on the Handling of Labor Disputes has been received. Since the case involves legal ambiguities, the Judicial Yuan has been consulted and replied by telegram. Now, the Judicial Yuan's Reply No. 871 has been received, stating, Your Yuan's Inquiry No. 319 of November 19th of last year, requesting an interpretation of ambiguities in the application of the Amended Law on the Handling of Labor Disputes, has been resolved by the Court's Unified Interpretation of Laws Conference. Before the Amended Law on the Handling of Labor Disputes is implemented, for those who have declared dissent from the ruling of the arbitration committee and filed a lawsuit in court, but have not yet been determined by a judgment, it should be considered an unresolved event as referred to in Article 44, Paragraph 2 of the law, in accordance with National Government Instruction No. 11 of this year. It is appropriate to reply for your reference. In addition to ordering the Ministry of Industry to circulate the inquiry, a copy of National Government Instruction No. 11 of this year is attached, ordering the Municipal Government to immediately notify the labor party to directly request compulsory execution from the court in accordance with civil laws, etc.' A copy of the attached instruction is attached. In response to this, it has been repeatedly approved by the Supreme Court that the employer has appealed on January 14th, and this court has ordered the appellant to pay the litigation fees in accordance with the law and to submit a written statement of reasons. This court will only be able to hear the case in accordance with the law after it has been corrected. Now, due to the previous reasons, in addition to replying and requesting a swift transfer of the matter to the Judicial Yuan to instruct the Supreme Court to comply, it is urgent to copy the original attachments and order your bureau to immediately comply and transfer the matter to the labor party for compliance. This order.'" "In response to this, it is urgent to copy the original attachments and order your association to comply and handle it. This order."</p>
<p>National Government Instruction The National Government instructs the Judicial Yuan, stating, "For the matter of complying with orders, the Central Executive Committee's Office in Beijing forwarded Document No. 15773 from the Zheng County Yu Feng Yarn Factory Labor Union, which telegraphed that the factory had breached the contract and refused to comply with arbitration, requesting assistance. In addition, the Shanghai Municipal Government presented the long-pending labor-management dispute at San You Industrial, requesting verification and handling. The Central Guidance Committee for People's Movement replied that the National Government should announce the Amended Law on the Handling of Labor Disputes to allow for execution in accordance with the law. In response to the case submitted to the government, the Amended Law on the Handling of Labor Disputes had already been announced by the government on September 27, 1932, and the office was immediately ordered to reply. Now, the Chief Secretary of the Central Executive Committee's Secretariat Office forwarded Document No. 18653, stating that the labor-management dispute at San You Industrial Society had been appealed to the Jiangsu High Court and remained unresolved. Now that the Law on the Handling of Labor Disputes has been promulgated, the San You Industrial dispute should be handled in accordance with the new law without the need for a court ruling. The Standing Committee approved a letter ordering the National Government to instruct the Judicial Yuan to instruct the Jiangsu High Court to issue a ruling in accordance with the law that the labor and management parties in the case would not be accepted. This is hereby communicated, hoping that you will investigate and forward it for handling, etc. On this basis, it should be handled accordingly. In addition to ordering the office to reply, it is appropriate to order your court to forward it for compliance and handling. This order."</p>
<p>Labor's Reply The 7th District Cotton Weaving Industry Labor Union, because the employer did not comply with the High Court's ruling and appealed to the Supreme Court, also submitted a statement of defense, which reads, "For the appeal of San You Industrial Society, a statement of defense is submitted, requesting the dismissal of the appeal and requesting that the case file be quickly sent to the Shanghai District Court for compulsory execution in order to maintain the lives of the workers. The fact that the labor and management parties have never been dismissed has not only been stated in detail in the plaintiffs' first and second instance pleadings but has also been thoroughly discussed in the first and second instance judgments. There is no reason for disagreement. The intention of the appellant in appealing to the third instance in this case is nothing more than to delay and place the respondent workers in a state of invisible dismissal. It has been found that the Judicial Yuan's Interpretation No. 871 has already interpreted this case and should apply the Amended Law on the Handling of Labor Disputes, so the ruling made by the Shanghai Municipal Arbitration Committee on September 1, 1932, has already taken effect. There is no room for appeal for the appellant. In addition to having applied to the Shanghai District Court for compulsory execution in accordance with Article 38 of the Amended Law on the Handling of Labor Disputes, we respectfully request that your court dismiss the appeal and quickly send the case file to the original court of first instance for execution in order to maintain the lives of the workers. This would be a great act of kindness. Sincerely, the Supreme Court. Attached is a copy of the Shanghai Municipal Government Social Affairs Bureau Order No. 973, a copy of National Government Instruction No. 11. The plaintiff, the Shanghai 7th District Cotton Weaving Industry Labor Union, right legal representative Gong Yuting, Zhang Ruhai, representative lawyer Wei Wenhan."</p>
<h3>Yang Dezhao's Visit to Shanghai Postponed to the End of the Month</h3>
<p>Recalled by Chen Jitang's Telegram Before Departure</p>
<p>Yang Dezhao, representative of Chen Jitang of Guangdong, is now under the command of the Southeast Political Affairs Committee, holding personal letters from Hu Hanmin and Chen Jitang to Chairman Chiang, and was scheduled to depart from Hong Kong on the Empress of Canada on the 24th. However, Yang suddenly received a telegram from Chen Jitang before departure, recalling him to Guangzhou with a new mission. Therefore, Mr. Yang did not arrive in Shanghai yesterday. According to Yang's friend who received the telegram from Guangdong, Yang has changed his schedule to leave Hong Kong on the President Hoover on the 29th of this month, and is expected to arrive in port on the 31st, and then go to Nanjing to meet Chairman Chiang and negotiate everything.</p>
<h3>Public Utilities in the Public Concession</h3>
<p>Situation in the Past Year</p>
<p>The Municipal Council's work report for the past year includes information on various public utilities. The following is a brief summary of their main points:</p>
<p>Waterworks Company Regarding the water supply issue, after the Hill's investigation report, the Water Supply Investigation Committee recommended several principles in June of this year. Regarding the installation of water meters, a temporary measure was agreed upon by the Municipal Council and the company in 1931, by which the company would install water meters throughout the concession, but would divide areas with higher and lower rents into small areas and discuss how to help poor users. The summer of 1932 was very hot, and water consumption increased greatly. In the areas where meters were installed, the water prices increased significantly, but some waste was unavoidable. However, the Municipal Council agreed in July to allow the company to consider reducing fees for those with excessive increases during the investigation and research period, generally increasing the fees by no more than 30% of the old rent rate. However, complaints continued to be heard. In September, the Real Estate Association suggested two solutions: either continue with the old system or install meters in each household. However, the water company had already spent about one million taels on water meters, and the installation work was already three-quarters complete. If this method were abandoned, the waste could not be prevented. Moreover, the meter system had already been used in the French Concession and the Chinese areas. Also, in areas with higher rents, water bills could be reduced after installing meters. Even in large buildings where landlords paid a lump sum, water consumption could be reduced if landlords could persuade tenants to avoid waste. If landlords did not repair water pipes and faucets, it would be difficult to save water. Water bills had increased by one and a half to three times after the installation of meters. Landlords whose properties were already mortgaged and burdened with heavy interest and whose rents could not be increased could not afford these water bills. Therefore, a temporary measure was taken to increase the old price by one-third, regardless of the meter reading. However, this method was only a temporary solution, and a scientific method must be devised to ensure that poor users receive preferential treatment and that landlords do not suffer losses. As of the end of the year, the matter was still under negotiation by all parties. In addition, the water company was also in contact with the Chinese authorities regarding water supply to western Shanghai.</p>
<p>Electric Power Company The purchase price of the Electric Power Company has been paid to the Municipal Council for a principal of 56,693,910 taels and an interest of 12,991,513 taels. As of February 1, 1933, the company still owed the Municipal Council a total of 24,306,090 taels. The company's assets were originally mortgaged to the Municipal Council, but now a guarantee letter has been issued by HSBC Bank, allowing the company to recover all of the mortgages for operational use. This matter has been approved by the bureau. The issue of the company's out-of-boundary operations is also being negotiated with the Chinese authorities.</p>
<p>Telephone Company The company reported to the Municipal Council in April of this year that the conversion to automatic switching had been completed as scheduled (excluding certain parts). The company's expenses for this project amounted to over 4.9 million US dollars, equivalent to about 17 million taels. The Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council then allowed the company to increase telephone charges from March 27th according to the Anson Report's standards. The company also requested to increase the charges by an additional 11% beyond the Anson increase. The two Municipal Councils only allowed this to be considered as material for future consideration. Regarding telephones outside the boundary, the company has a draft agreement with the Chinese authorities, but the responsibility for the expenses is still under discussion as of the end of the year.</p>
<p>Transportation Business The streetcar company traveled approximately 10 million miles and carried approximately 140 million passengers this year. The company currently has 102 locomotives, 100 trailers, and 98 trolleybuses. Given the crowded conditions, it is difficult to increase the number of vehicles. In addition, the public bus company added 44 vehicles this year and now has a total of 164 vehicles. The issue of operating double-decker vehicles has been investigated in London by the company's experts and the chief engineer of the Municipal Council's Works Department, and it is deemed that there are still difficulties and it cannot be implemented immediately.</p>

<h3>Telegraphic Message of Support to Chiang Kai-shek</h3>
<p>The association telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek yesterday, saying (abbreviated titles): "Disasters frequently befall us, the nation is in dire straits. The Northeast has been lost for a year now. We looked forward to enduring hardship to wipe away national shame. Who would have thought that national traitors would retreat without a fight, causing Rehe to fall into enemy hands and making Peking and Tientsin precarious? The enemy is watching with fierce eyes and acting with impunity, increasingly harming our peaceful nature and disregarding public opinion and humanity. The sound of gunfire continues, and blades fill the land. Blood flows like rivers, and corpses pile up in the fields. Alas, my Yellow Emperor's descendants, how can we not be saddened? Even if we groan in despair, how dare we speak up even a little? Alas, the insatiable greed of the enemy has already become apparent, and the danger of dismemberment is a real concern. Now, Your Excellency is aware of this and is urgently considering recovering lost territories to prevent our people from becoming slaves in foreign lands. Some say that we should focus on recuperation and education, each aiming for ten years. However, the situation is extremely urgent and brooks no delay. We must command the winds and clouds, sleep on our arms awaiting the dawn, build a strong fortress with our firm resolve, and dislodge the evil forces. Our association, as part of the nation, will offer humble meals and drinks and provide rear-area support, fulfilling our duty as citizens. Charging on horseback to kill the enemy and serve the motherland is the duty of the generals. We hope to cooperate and divide the labor, enduring this great difficulty together. One day, when the victorious armies return, we will strike at the heart of Japan, drink heartily from the Yellow Dragon fountain, and quickly eliminate our irreconcilable enemy, restoring our beautiful land. The people and the generals will forever dance in peace. We look forward to your command with endless respect. The Jiangsu Native Place Association bows in respect."</p>
<p>Sun and Song, Two Army Commanders</p>
<h3>Telegram of Thanks for Condolences from Ningbo Native Place Association</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai, to support the soldiers fighting against the enemy in North China, allocated 5,000 yuan, entrusting Mr. Zhu Ziqiao to distribute 3,000 yuan to the troops of Song Zheyuan and 2,000 yuan to the troops of Sun Dianying, and sent telegrams of condolence. The association has since received telegrams of thanks from Commanders Sun and Song, which are recorded below. Sun Dianying's reply telegram reads: "To Mr. Yu Qiaqing of the Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai: We have just received the telegram from Mr. Zhu Qiao of the Support Association. We are deeply grateful for your generous donation of 2,000 yuan and your kind words of encouragement. We are filled with shame and gratitude. Our troops are stationed in northern Rehe, fighting to the death with the brutal Japanese. However, the abandonment of Chengde has left our troops heavily besieged. We are determined to resist to the death, bravely fight the enemy, uphold our steadfast aspirations, blunt the enemy's elite forces, shed blood in the frozen sky, cross the desolate desert, hope to recover lost territory, restore our mountains and rivers, and repay your kindness. We ask for your continued guidance and encouragement. We send our best wishes. Commander Sun Kuiyuan of the 41st Army bows in respect." Song Zheyuan's reply telegram reads: "To Mr. Yu Qiaqing of the Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai and all the gentlemen: We have just received the telegram forwarded by Mr. Zhu Ziqiao. We are deeply ashamed that we have not completely succeeded in killing the enemy, and we are overly honored by your praise. We are deeply grateful for the 3,000 yuan in condolences for our officers and soldiers. We admire your patriotic enthusiasm. We send this telegram to express our thanks. Your younger brother Song Zheyuan bows in respect."</p>

<h3>Organization of Doctors Along the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>Along the Yangtze River, in provinces such as Jiangxi, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, there are approximately two thousand doctors who are organized into groups and travel through various counties and villages, commonly known as "traveling doctors." This organization is extremely tight-knit, with leaders and creeds, and excellent unity. They rely on various secretly transmitted unique prescriptions to sell their skills. The advantages and disadvantages of Chinese medicine are both present in this. Currently, the Rural Medical Improvement Society of this city, in order to understand the content of this organization, has assigned members in various regions to conduct investigations. According to the cadres of the society, before complete medical facilities are available in rural areas, these lower-level doctors should not be looked down upon. It is necessary to trace their origins and improve them.</p>
<p>Shanghai Medical College</p>
<h3>Rescue Team Arrives in Beiping to Work</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war in Rehe, Mr. Yan Fuqing, the president of the National Shanghai Medical College (formerly the Medical College of National Central University), has been planning rescue efforts in the north. He jointly initiated the North China Rescue Committee with key figures in the North China medical community and Mr. Liu Ruiheng, the Director of the National Health Administration, to oversee rescue efforts in North China. At the same time, he dispatched several surgeons to join the Red Cross rescue team to work in the north. Recently, due to the intensification of the war in Rehe, many of our officers and soldiers were injured, and the rescue personnel in North China were insufficient. After Mr. Liu sent an urgent telegram to the college, the president immediately convened all senior students and several surgeons overnight to form a rescue team. They departed on March 16 and arrived in Beiping on the 18th. The North China Rescue Committee has assigned them to Feng Yong University on Xizhimen Street in Beiping to organize a rear-area hospital, specializing in accommodating seriously injured officers and soldiers. Feng Yong University is the former site of the Army University, with ample space. The team is preparing 1,000 beds for large-scale operations.</p>
<p>Dachang Lawyer</p>
<h3>Awarded Army Medal of Honor</h3>
<p>Mr. Dachang, a lawyer in this city, returned to China in August 1914 after the outbreak of the European War to serve his country. He joined the 12th Artillery Regiment of the Fifth Army. Shortly after, while serving as a messenger, he fell in front of the German lines. Two days later, he returned to the camp. In 1916, he joined the 208th Artillery Regiment in Verdun and participated in the Battle of Verdun. Later, he was poisoned by gas and had to leave the service. After recovering, he managed a contingent of Chinese laborers in the French Army. He was demobilized in February 1919. Recently, the National Federation of Volunteers of the French European War submitted a request to the French government to award Army Medals of Honor to officers and soldiers who had contributed to the war effort. The French government approved the request, and Dachang was among those honored.</p>

<p>Daji Restaurant</p>
<h3>Murder Case in the Birthday Celebration Hall</h3>
<p>An Uninvited Guest Opens Fire Under the Pretense of Gift-Giving</p>
<p>Joyful Celebration Suddenly Turns Into Tragic Killing</p>
<p>Fatally Wounded and Died in the Evening</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 4 o'clock, a young man was shot and killed by an enemy in the Daji Restaurant on Xiaodongmen Street in the French Concession. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Gu Daosheng's Family Background</h3>
<p>Gu Yuelai, also known as Daosheng, was 27 years old and originally from Nanxiang. He moved to Gujiazhai in Dachang Town, the site of the fiercest fighting during the January 28th Incident. He currently resides at No. 277 Wangjia Wharf in Nanshi. His parents passed away when he was nearly twenty years old. His father was a boatman. Gu initially inherited his father's business, but soon abandoned it and took up another occupation.</p>
<h3>Gu's Wife's Name is Jin Cunbao</h3>
<p>Gu's wife's name is Jin Cunbao, nickname A'da, is 22 years old and from Jiaxing. Her father, Jin Bingwen, courtesy name Luting, is celebrating his sixtieth birthday. He has been blind since childhood and now makes a living by divination and fortune-telling. Her mother, Mrs. Jin, is 52 years old. Because her children were infertile, when Cunbao was born, she followed a local superstition and made Cunbao the adopted child of a so-called powerful Liu surname immortal, so A'da is also known as Liu Cunbao.</p>
<h3>Sixty-Year Celebration Feast</h3>
<p>Gu entered the Jin family in March of the twentieth year of the Republic (lunar calendar). The young couple has always had a very good relationship. Yesterday happened to be Luting's sixtieth birthday. Gu, in order to please his father-in-law, specially held a banquet for him in the main hall of Daji Restaurant, No. 55-57 Xiaodongmen Street, French Concession. Invitations were sent out beforehand. From 9 o'clock yesterday morning, guests arrived one after another.</p>
<h3>Two Uninvited Guests Arrive Suddenly</h3>
<p>Around 4:20 p.m., as Gu was busy receiving guests, two uninvited guests suddenly arrived. One was wearing a snowflake wool long gown, and the other was wearing a dark-colored long robe. When they entered the shop, they greeted Gu. Gu personally went to greet them from in front of the cashier counter. The two uninvited guests stopped at the threshold of the hall. The one in the long robe handed Gu two silver dollars in his sleeve. However, as Gu took the money and was about to turn to the cashier counter, disaster struck suddenly.</p>
<h3>The Murderer Opens Fire and Escapes</h3>
<p>At that time, as Yuan Zheng slightly turned his body, the uninvited guest suddenly pulled out a pistol and fired at Gu's head. A bullet hit the right cheekbone. Gu fell to the ground with a sound, blood gushing like a spring, and immediately lost consciousness. By the time the guests rushed out, the murderer had already fled west without a trace. At the same time, the Chinese police officer from No. 157 heard the news and rushed to the scene. He immediately reported to the police station and had Gu taken to Renji Hospital by car.</p>
<h3>Died From Injuries and Reported for Examination</h3>
<p>The police chief, upon receiving the report, immediately sent Chinese and Western detectives to conduct a detailed investigation and took a spent shell casing back to the police station for investigation. However, Gu died in the hospital at 6:20 p.m. due to the severity of his injuries. The hospital immediately notified the police station to inform the Tongren Fuyuan Branch, who carried the body to the coroner's office and reported it to the Second Special District Court, which will send personnel to examine it today.</p>
<p>Inside the Old North Gate</p>
<h3>Major Robbery Case on Changsheng Street</h3>
<p>A Gang of Thieves Robs in Broad Daylight</p>
<p>Five Households Suffer Losses Together</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 26th) around 10 a.m., a major robbery case occurred in broad daylight at No. 1 Yude Lane, Changsheng Street, inside the Old North Gate of Shanghai. The thieves fled with the stolen goods. The details obtained from the investigation are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Background of the Victims</h3>
<p>Changsheng Street is located east of the Nine Mu Land inside the Old North Gate, connecting to Shizi Lane to the south. No. 1 Yude Lane is a three-story building with two floors at the bottom of the south building. The second landlord is Wang Wuting from Anhui, who runs a tea and snack shop in the concession. His family lives in the lower wing room, with the living room being shared. The tenant in the living room on the second floor is a Mr. Zhu from Changzhou, who works at the gauze exchange. The tenant in the wing room on the second floor is Qi Zongzhao from Shaoxing, who runs the Taixing Foreign Paper Company and had only moved in three days ago, with some equipment still not moved in. The tenant in the living room on the third floor is Zhou Xiaokang from Pudong, who is a broker at the gauze exchange. The tenant in the wing room on the third floor is a Mr. Zhu from Pudong, who works as a cashier in a department of the Wing On Company. All were visited by the thieves and suffered considerable losses.</p>
<h3>Details of the Robbery</h3>
<p>Five thieves, all wearing blue cloth short shirts and trousers and speaking the local dialect, entered through the main gate, claiming to be investigating opium. Three of the thieves carried pistols. They first went to the east wing room of the second landlord, Mr. Wang, and used their guns to threaten them into silence. They then ransacked the room, while one thief remained at the door, keeping watch with a gun. The remaining thieves went upstairs.</p>
<h3>Apricot Kernel Gambling Scam</h3>
<p>A Simpleton Was Scammed Once</p>
<p>Suffered Considerable Losses</p>
<p>Suddenly Realized on the Way</p>
<p>The Culprits Were All Arrested</p>
<p>Wu Yushan, a native of Xuzhou, nicknamed "Simpleton," met two strangers, Shi Jinquan and Wang Jincheng, from Anhui on the 19th of this month. Shi and Wang suddenly stopped and engaged him in conversation, asking about each other's origins. Shi and Wang immediately claimed to be from the same hometown as Wu, saying that they were working at Yutaichang Shenzhuang, No. 714 Jiuan Lane, Shilu North, Wuma Road. The owner of the Zhuang, a certain gentleman also from Pengcheng, had died in Shanghai and they planned to transport the coffin back home so that he could be properly buried. However, they had not yet found a suitable burial site. Since Wu was from Xuzhou, could he please help find a piece of land to bury him, as a gesture of hometown friendship, and a generous reward would be given. Wu was secretly pleased to hear this and readily agreed, and recognized Shi and Wang as friends. He immediately followed them to Yutaichang Shenzhuang in Jiuan Lane. At that time, there was a Zhang Shutang from Zhejiang sitting in the Zhuang. Shi and Wang whispered to Wu, saying that Zhang was very rich and the paper package next to him contained banknotes, no less than five or six thousand yuan. They might as well use a small trick to take it for themselves. Wu, who was known as "Simpleton," was indeed foolish and blinded by greed at the time. Instead, he asked Shi and Wang how to do it. Shi and the others proposed gambling. Although there were no gambling tools, they temporarily used apricot kernels as counters. Wu was the banker, and he randomly grabbed apricot kernels in his palm. Zhang would guess a number from one to four. If there were five kernels, it would still be counted as one, six kernels as two, seven kernels as three, and so on. At first, Zhang did not guess correctly and lost hundreds of dollars. The last time, Wu originally took ten apricot kernels, but Shi secretly took one away. Wu did not know this and still tightly held his palm. This time, Zhang put all his money on the number one. Wu still thought he had won, but when he opened his hand to count, there were only nine apricot kernels, which would be counted as one. He had to give all his winnings to Zhang, which was still not enough. In addition to handing over the 98 yuan in cash and two gold rings worth 25 yuan, he still owed 240 yuan. Wu was forced to write a promissory note before he could get away. However, the day before yesterday, Wu met Shi on the road again and could not help but bring up the old matter. Shi suddenly told Wu to leave Shanghai immediately, otherwise Zhang would use the note to demand payment. At this moment, Simpleton suddenly became clear-headed and realized that the whole thing was a scam. He immediately called the police and had Shi arrested at the Laozha Gate Police Station. Detective Lang Tang brought in Wang, Lü, and Zhang. They were then sent to the First Special District Local Court for interrogation. The police station lawyers Li Zhishan and Zhang Shizhu appeared in court and described the defendants' fraudulent activities, requesting that they be punished according to the law. Judge Wu briefly questioned both the plaintiff and the defendant and ordered the defendants to be detained for further interrogation.</p>
<p>They ransacked the Zhu family's room in the living room on the second floor. At that time, Zhu had not yet gotten up, and his wife had gone to the vegetable market to buy vegetables. The thieves woke Zhu up and forced him to go to the Wang family's room in the east wing downstairs, where he was guarded by the thieves. At that time, Zhu wanted to put on a long gown, but the thieves did not allow it. After the ransacking, one of the thieves took off his old blue cloth short shirt and trousers, put on a white silk short shirt, wore a blue thread spring short shirt, and put on a felt hat (all of Zhu's belongings), and then herded them to the Qi family's room on the second floor, then went up to the third floor to the Zhou family's room in the living room and the Zhu family's room in the wing, ransacking them one by one, without exception. After the ransacking was completed, the thieves put the stolen gold, silver, clothing, and jewelry, and the male and female victims, into two white leather suitcases (Wang's belongings, with blue cloth suitcase covers), carried them to the living room, and then locked the victims in the room. As the thieves were about to carry the stolen goods out the door, Mr. Zhu's wife from the living room on the second floor returned home from buying vegetables, carrying an umbrella, and was robbed of her umbrella by the thief on watch and driven into the wing room, where she was locked up with the others. Later, they carried the two suitcases of stolen goods out the back door, went to the Xilongkou, hired several rickshaws, and fled north.</p>
<h3>Stolen Losses</h3>
<p>The landlord Wang's family lost a diamond ring, more than 100 yuan in cash, and several pieces of silk and leather clothing worth more than 200 yuan, as well as two leather suitcases, worth more than 1,000 yuan in total. The Zhu family in the living room on the second floor lost a pair of gold bracelets, 60 yuan in cash (including a 10 yuan note found on Zhu's person), two gold rings, and silk and leather clothing. The Qi family in the wing room lost cash and jewelry worth about 100 yuan. The Zhou family on the third floor lost gold jewelry and leather clothing worth more than 1,000 yuan. The Zhu family in the wing room lost three pairs of gold bracelets and cash and clothing worth about 2,000 yuan, suffering the heaviest losses.</p>
<h3>Thieves' Lost Items</h3>
<p>A set of blue cloth short shirt and trousers, a piece of foreign cloth short shirt, and a commemorative badge, about the size of a silver dollar, made of paper, with the words "Youth" on one side and "Beware" on the other.</p>
<h3>Reporting to the Police and Investigation</h3>
<p>The victims were locked in the wing room downstairs. After realizing the thieves had left, they shouted for help, and neighbors entered and opened the lock, releasing them to report to the first precinct of the second district. Chief Shen Zhenhua immediately led police detectives to investigate and inquired about the thieves' appearance and clothing. He took the thieves' lost items back to the police station, dispatched police to investigate, and reported to the Public Security Bureau to issue a notice to all districts to investigate and arrest the thieves and recover the stolen goods.</p>

<p>China General Edison Company: Yesterday afternoon at around 2 o'clock, the 16th shareholders' meeting was held at Hubei Association Hall on Beijing Road. More than 191,000 shares were represented. After the meeting began with the usual formalities, Chairman Wang Yiting reported on the purpose of the meeting. Manager Lu Bohong reported on the business situation in 1932, stating that the lighting department had been greatly affected by the Shanghai War, and that the number of electricity users was 35,293, an increase of 2,878 from the previous year, with revenue of $1,643,129.08, a decrease of $166,368.23 from the previous year. There were 1,301 power users, an increase of 132 from the previous year, with revenue of $616,656.64, a decrease of $1,134.88 from the previous year. There were 490 electric power users, an increase of 102 from the previous year, with revenue of $15,779.48, an increase of $7,252.80 from the previous year. As for the tramway department, the total number of passengers was 35,036,228, with a fare revenue of $694,172.27, a decrease of 5,593,783 passengers and a decrease of $167,288.90 in fare revenue from the previous year. After the outbreak of war in Zhabei last year, the Nanshi area also entered a state of martial law. Although the company's tramways continued to operate during the day, the number of passengers was sparse due to the evacuation of residents, and the operating hours were shortened due to martial law, resulting in a sharp decline in revenue in the months of February, March, April, and May, a decrease of 35% compared to the same period last year, approximately $90,000. From June onwards, the situation gradually returned to normal. The total annual revenue, calculated in copper coins, decreased by 13% compared to the previous year. Furthermore, the exchange rate of copper coins depreciated, falling by an average of 7% compared to the previous year, resulting in additional losses in exchange. Therefore, when converted to silver dollars, the revenue decreased by slightly more than 19% compared to the previous year. Subsequently, Supervisor Zhang Wenbin reported on the accounts. The shareholders then voted to elect the supervisors, and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3>Zen Hall Becomes an Opium Den</h3>
<p>Three Sets of Opium Paraphernalia Confiscated in the Bao Laoye Temple</p>
<p>More Than a Dozen Monks Each Possess a Charming Wife</p>
<p>丨Abbot Zhang Wenyu and Others Have Each Been Sentenced to One Month of Imprisonment丨 Inside the Bao Laoye Temple at 542-543 Tunan Lane, North Henan Road, there are more than thirty monks living. The abbot, Zhang Wenyu, has a deep addiction to opium. Recently, the abbot, because most of the monks in the temple have the same hobby as him, in order to avoid the outflow of profits, prepared more opium paraphernalia and set up a "swallow's nest" in a more remote monk's room, so that everyone could taste the sweet dew together. Therefore, every day after chanting scriptures, they only indulge in smoking. This was discovered by Yao Jialin, the inspector general of District C, who believed that the monastery and Zen hall had become opium dens, which was a great violation of the law. He therefore requested a search warrant from the First Special District Local Court and rushed to the temple in the rain the day before yesterday afternoon to search it. At that time, most of the monks were out, and only the abbot and the incense keepers Xiao Dexing, Pan Baisheng, and Guo Chunlai, etc., were lying on a couch, indulging in their addiction. They were all arrested, and three sets of opium paraphernalia, two jars of opium paste, and sixty-nine rolls of dried opium were confiscated. At that time, more than a dozen young women suddenly appeared in the temple. Inspector Yao Jialin saw that they did not look like pilgrims and questioned them. To his surprise, the women all admitted in unison that they were the wives of the monks in the temple. It is truly unprecedented that monks who are supposed to be empty of the five aggregates and pure of the six senses suddenly have charming wives living in the monks' quarters, and it is enough to show the temple's usual achievements in hiding dirt and harboring filth. Inspector Yao Jialin, after seeing this strange phenomenon, scoffed at it and immediately took Zhang Wenyu and the other three, along with the opium paraphernalia, back to the police station. Yesterday, they were escorted to the First Special District Local Court, where Judge Huang Risheng interrogated them. Police lawyers Li Zhishan and Zhang Shizhu stated that they would prosecute the defendants for violating Article 11 of the Anti-Opium Law. Then, Inspector Yao Jialin reported the process of solving the case. When questioned, the defendants Zhang Wenyu and others all confessed to smoking opium. Judge Huang then sentenced the four defendants Zhang, Xiao, Pan, and Guo to one month of imprisonment each, and the opium paste and opium paraphernalia were confiscated.</p>

<h3>Love Tragedy</h3>
<p>丨Letter from Mr. Zhou Xikai of Fengjing丨</p>
<p>I am a young man in my twenties, and I was engaged last year through free love丨preliminary丨. At that time, due to a temporary impulse of sexual desire, I seemed to be lost in a fog and made this move; but her environment and everything are very bad. Since I got engaged to her, I have been indirectly and directly humiliated many times, and her character is extremely irritable. I was too reckless before, but now, after repeated consideration, I can only terminate the engagement, otherwise, I will back it up with my life; I am very determined about this matter, and I will not rest until the engagement is terminated! I wonder what the reporter thinks, and I hope to point out a bright path.</p>
<p>Answer: Since you are "very determined" to "terminate the engagement" with your lover "who was engaged due to a temporary impulse of sexual desire," then you can only solve it quickly. This method is good not only for you but also for your lover. Because both of you are young. To put it bluntly, both of you are "young and inexperienced." If you are together, the first thing is that there may be problems with your life. Moreover, you will be busy being someone's parents at a young age, which is really burying your own future. However, if you use "her character is extremely irritable" as the reason for terminating the engagement, I want to stand up for that lady. According to my speculation, it is not that her temperament is irritable, but that your temperament is irritable. Because you yourself have admitted that you "acted too rashly." People who are rash are not irritable. This is the most common problem for men. If so, then the fault lies with you, not her. You have become a heartless person. Terminating an engagement is certainly not a big deal in today's society. However, the relationship between men and women is ultimately not trivial. If you only think about one party and do not consider the other party, it is not fair. What do you think?</p>
<h3>Medical and Pharmaceutical Circles</h3>
<p>Famous Doctor Zhang Songxi: He has in-depth research in traditional Chinese medicine and has practiced medicine on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road for many years, which has been praised by people in the community. Mr. Zhang has recently returned to Shanghai from Hangzhou and set up a clinic at 11 Tianjin Road, Jiangxi Road Intersection. He is available for consultation from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM every day. There are quite a few people from the sea who come to seek medical advice. It is also heard that Mr. Zhang sympathizes with the working class in society who are troubled by poverty and illness and have no ability to seek medical treatment. He is willing to provide free consultations to all of them to serve the public society, but they must have a certificate from a qualified store before they can do so.</p>
<p>Correction: In the fourth line of the twelfth page of the third edition of the 25th newspaper, "Publication of the New 1 Yuan Directory by Taile Lun Yangxing," the four characters "Taile Dun Yangxing" were mistakenly placed before "Bandits Open Fire and Mistakenly Kill Companions." Correction is urgently needed.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that the surrounding area of Shandong and the Yellow Sea are cloudy, gradually becoming overcast, with strong northwesterly to northeasterly winds.

The coastal area south of Ma'anshan Island is cloudy with rain or fog, with northerly to northeasterly winds. There is a cyclone in Korea, caused by a low pressure passing through and moving northeast-eastward. Also, within 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the temperature in this city was 47.5 degrees at the highest and 41.0 degrees at the lowest. On the same day last year, the highest was 75. degrees and the lowest was 47.7 degrees.</p>

<p>— Pang Jingzhou</p>
<p>Chapter 4 Business Conditions</p>
<p>The income of new medical business, except for surgeons who can receive a one-time high surgery fee, in addition to this, no matter how much each department is raised, it is not a business to accumulate wealth. The biggest reason is that new doctors take time to diagnose diseases, and experts need to invest in equipment. Other departments such as ophthalmology, rhinology, and urology do not have outpatient business. Assuming that a new doctor sees 40 patients a day including outpatients, and each patient takes 20 minutes, it takes a total of 800 minutes. Excluding travel time, it can be considered that it is already very sloppy. However, the daily work is already more than 13 hours, from 9:00 AM to 10:20 PM, and there is no time for eating and excretion. On average, each patient costs about three or four dollars, which is only more than one hundred dollars. The income for one day is afraid that after working for three months, the doctor himself will get sick. It is not as fast as the old doctors who only need a piece of white paper, a bald pen, and two students, and can see hundreds of patients a day. However, new doctors are often given the unclean name of making a fortune, which is very strange!</p>
<p>In theory, a practicing doctor should not refuse a patient's invitation without reason. However, now there are several doctors with property who are afraid of being kidnapped and will not go to an outpatient clinic without someone's introduction. In this unstable city of Shanghai, it is necessary to find a safe house to live in, and it is also necessary to go through introductions to ask for medical treatment when you are sick, which is too bitter. However, this is a public security issue, which is too far from the scope of this article, so I will not discuss it for the time being. There are also several famous doctors who indicate that they refuse to see patients late at night, perhaps because they are too busy during the day and cannot endure hard work, or perhaps because they are weak and cannot endure getting up late at night. This kind of refusal to see patients has caused dissatisfaction among the people in the society, but it also feels that it is too strict to blame the doctors. Some people say: This kind of method is deliberately to raise the price, but it is not what the stupid people dare to judge arbitrarily, so I can only ask a few doctors who refuse to see patients late at night themselves. In fact, if the city's hospitals are more developed, then the emergency outpatient clinics late at night can often be divided by the hospital by half, and the need for practicing doctors to see patients late at night will be reduced.</p>
<p>Not counting the poor and sick has become a necessary clause in the medical community's diagnostic examples. In this Shanghai where civilian medical treatment is very difficult, it is not a good phenomenon. However, there is no way to prove whether it can really not be counted. On the one hand, the definition of the word "poor" is too broad. Assuming that the doctor's own living standard is used as the standard, then most of the people are inferior to him. It is enough to think about a doctor sitting in a large car and going to a place where four families live in a one-up-and-one-down house to see a doctor. The habit of ordinary new doctors is not to collect consultation fees first when seeing a doctor. If you reduce the fees temporarily at your own discretion, it is a matter of personal morality. Compared with the old medical community's habits, especially the famous doctors in the old medical community, who would not go out or get in the car unless they collected all the money first, it is already much kinder. However, people in society often forgive the doctors who collect all the money first and go out, and blame the doctors who charge after seeing the patient too much. There is nothing else to say, one is exposed and one is hidden, one is deep and one is straightforward. The methods adopted are different. The deep one is ultimately clever and takes advantage of it. However, the famous doctors in the new medical community probably also take this method of collecting money before going out because of the excessive restrictions on outpatient services. No wonder the society feels that it is more and more difficult to consult new doctors. Among the old doctors, the famous Zhang in Shanghai still only charges a few dimes for outpatient services, regardless of whether they are poor or rich, and specially returns the money to the poor. Can everyone do this method of his? Is it suitable for the current society? That is another matter. However, his spirit of being thrifty himself and thinking about the poor is worthy of praise no matter what.</p>
<h3>On Drinking I</h3>
<p>— Yu Yunxiu</p>
<p>People in ancient and modern times all say that drinking causes disease because of water. There is no difference. However, there are two more things that need to be distinguished. One is phlegm disease, and the other is water disease. The difference between drinking and phlegm is that one is serous fluid and the other is mucus. It has been said before that it seems that all diseases that can produce serous fluid can be called drinking diseases. According to the four kinds of drinking in Jin Gui, the symptoms of phlegm drinking are: "The person was originally strong but is now thin. The water flows between the intestines and makes a dripping sound." This is stomach dilation and intestinal dilation. The occurrence of gas in the intestines is also involved. The water accumulated in the stomach and intestines is mixed with the gas in it. When it goes down, it oscillates and separates and makes a sound. However, the water in the stomach and intestines has external sources and internal sources. The Great Five Drinking Pills in Qianjin contain five kinds of drinking, one of which is flowing drinking. The water is in the intestines and shakes and makes a sound. Chao Shi's Treatise on the Source of Diseases states: Flowing drinking is caused by drinking too much water. The water flows between the stomach and intestines and makes a gurgling sound. According to this, the flowing drinking in Qianjin's Treatise on the Source of Diseases is the phlegm drinking in Jin Gui. The Treatise on the Source of Diseases also believes that it is caused by drinking too much water. In that case, the water in phlegm drinking comes from the outside and is not produced from the inside. In fact, the water in phlegm drinking can also be mixed with the secretions of the stomach and intestines. All acute and chronic gastritis and enteritis that can secrete serous fluid and generate gas can have the sound of dripping water flowing. However, Jin Gui has the words "originally strong but now thin," which indicates that the phlegm drinking in Jin Gui belongs to chronic diseases. It is undoubtedly diseases such as stomach dilation and prolapse, and intestinal dilation and prolapse. The main reason is that ulcerative stenosis and existing cancer and tuberculosis are obstacles. In that case, "originally strong but now thin, water flows between the intestines and makes a dripping sound" is just a common phenomenon in all diseases and is not unique to one disease. It is clear that the words "phlegm drinking" cannot be used to specifically name one disease.</p>
<p>The symptoms of hanging drinking in Jin Gui are: "After drinking, water flows under the ribs and coughing and spitting cause pain." It also says, "The pulse is deep and wiry, and there is internal pain in hanging drinking." The Treatise on the Source of Diseases discusses the symptoms of hanging obstruction, saying, "The obstruction qi is between the ribs and extends up in a wiry manner. Coughing and spitting cause pain under the ribs." The words "in the ribs" and "coughing and spitting cause pain" are the same as the symptoms of hanging drinking. However, the words "obstruction qi" seem to be different from the water in hanging drinking. However, the Treatise on the Source of Diseases discusses the symptoms of obstruction, saying that it is caused by drinking too much water and liquid, which causes it to stagnate and not disperse. Furthermore, it encounters cold qi and accumulates to form obstruction. Obstruction means that it is located on the side between the two ribs and sometimes causes pain. According to this, obstruction is water in the ribs. In that case, the hanging obstruction in the Treatise on the Source of Diseases is hanging drinking. The Treatise on the Source of Diseases also discusses the symptoms of obstruction drinking, saying, "It is caused by drinking too much water. The water qi stagnates between the two ribs. When it encounters cold qi and fights against it, it gathers to form a mass, which is called obstruction drinking. It is under the ribs and extends up in a wiry manner. Pressing it makes a water sound." This is also the same as hanging obstruction. It is also hanging drinking. The Treatise on the Source of Diseases also discusses the symptoms of drinking obstruction, saying, "It is caused by drinking too much water. It does not disperse under the ribs. Furthermore, it encounters cold qi and causes pain, which is called drinking obstruction. Its shape is that the ribs are tense and there is often a water sound." This is the same as obstruction drinking. It is also hanging obstruction. It is also hanging drinking. In short, water under the ribs that causes pain when coughing and spitting is called hanging drinking. At the time when it extends up in a wiry manner, it is called hanging obstruction. When there is a water sound, it is called obstruction drinking or drinking obstruction. The four are the same disease. The symptoms of the disease are pain under the ribs. It extends up in a wiry manner and forms a mass. There is a water sound. Among them, the symptom of pain under the ribs is quite similar to the current wet pleurisy. However, it is not pleurisy. How do I know? Pleurisy does not extend up in a wiry manner. Furthermore, pressing it does not make a water sound. This is how I know. It is also similar to hydrothorax in circulatory disorders. However, it is not hydrothorax. How do I know? Hydrothorax also does not extend up in a wiry manner. Pressing it also does not make a water sound. Not only that, but I have already said that drinking obstruction is hanging drinking. However, the two prescriptions for drinking obstruction in Wai Tai Mi Yao, one is Shen Shi Fuzi Tang and the other is Beiji Zhishi Baizhu Tang. The diseases that these two prescriptions treat all have the words "the heart is firm, like the edge of a plate, like a spinning cup." The heart is firm like a cup or a plate is similar to the symptoms of hanging obstruction extending up in a wiry manner and forming a mass. However, the location is slightly different. This symptom is only found in cases of extreme stomach dilation and excessive gas generation. In addition, it is only found in cases of congestive liver due to heart disease. Pleurisy and hydrothorax have the symptoms of the heart being firm like the edge of a plate or a cup. This is another proof that hanging drinking is not a symptom of pleurisy or hydrothorax.</p>
<p>In that case, what exactly is the heart in hanging drinking being firm like a cup or a plate? I say, it is also not congestive liver. How do I know? Because congestive liver also does not make a water sound when pressed. Because it has the symptom of making a water sound when pressed, I know that the disease of hanging drinking must be stomach dilation. Because it has the symptom of extending up in a wiry manner, forming a mass, or the heart being firm like a cup or a plate, I know that the disease of hanging drinking, in addition to stomach dilation, also has extremely severe gas generation, and the dilated part is compressed by the swelling and bloating to the surrounding viscera, so there are symptoms of coughing and spitting causing pain or internal pain. In that case, what else could be the disease of hanging drinking? It is also stomach dilation and gas generation. However, the part that bulges and expands is located near the ribs or under the heart, on the side, and the degree of gas generation is particularly severe compared to phlegm drinking. Apart from this, no other disease can be similar.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Chastity and Bloodline</h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>To speak of chastity today may be ridiculed as reversing progress. However, it has been passed down for thousands of years, and there must be a reason. If it is said that it is the shackles of the doctrine of principle, then it can be forced on for a time, but it cannot be practiced permanently. There have been women who cut their faces and destroyed their bodies to show their loyalty, and there have been those who endured hardship to raise orphans. Among the myriad living beings, are there not one or two who are intelligent and outstanding? There must be a reason for it that cannot be criticized. The ancients praised chaste women, saying: like the constancy of pine and cypress, like the purity of ice and frost. Constancy and purity, are they empty words? After thinking deeply about the reason, I found it. It is nothing more than ethics and physiology.</p>
<p>The saying of ethics, what is called chastity, its words may be close to empty talk, the saying of physiology, what is called purity, its saying naturally returns to empirical evidence. From the former, historical records are all there, from the latter, it has not been heard before. Please discuss it briefly.</p>
<p>The concept of race is probably deeper than that of the Chinese people! Its social structure is based on the patriarchal system. Therefore, the idea of excluding foreigners is the most important, and the taboo of disrupting the clan is especially strict. A surname has the bloodline of a surname, and a person has the bloodline of a person. The purity and impurity of the bloodline is based on the chastity and licentiousness of women. Therefore, women have a relationship that controls the race in the family.</p>
<p>A remarried woman has a very impure bloodline, because the infiltration of her former husband is permanent and does not disappear. After she has been pregnant once, the infiltration of her husband is deep. Even if she remarries someone else, the children she bears still resemble her former husband very much. In genetics, this is called "heteropaternal inheritance" or "infiltration inheritance." The impurity of the bloodline is self-evident. European white women who first marry black men and then marry white men often have children who still contain dark pigment. Their confusion of black and white is also enough to prove the complexity of their inheritance. In that case, the meaning of the ancients' prohibition of remarriage may be rooted in physiological observation. As for whether it is appropriate or not, it remains to be studied by geneticists.</p>

<h3>Aviation for National Salvation and Medicine for National Salvation (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Wang Qizhang</p>
<p>Why do I mention medicine here? Because after the September 18th Incident, when the Japanese bandits invaded China, the people finally realized the need for aviation and the benefits of airplanes. Especially after the January 28th Incident, the people in the Shanghai area personally experienced it. However, before the September 18th Incident, no one, under the banner of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy, loudly called for attention and urged everyone to quickly prepare and realize it. Some who were relatively clear-sighted only thought that aviation was a useful tool for convenient transportation and saving passengers' time. However, only a few dared to take a ride, and most of them cited the records of accidents and loudly opposed it. The government set up aviation schools and opened airplane fields, but no one cared or paid attention, and no one called for public assistance. If anyone advocated it, they would definitely be met with cold eyes and curses. Therefore, the most pitiful and hateful are those old doctors who have not been baptized by science and lack a global perspective. Don't they feel it themselves? In recent days, why is everyone so enthusiastic about spending money to buy foreign airplanes? We have never used airplanes before, but our nation has still developed and prospered for four or five thousand years, and we have not seen national extinction. If you say it's just for fun, we have long had Gongshuzi carving wood to make kites, Liezi riding the wind, Lei Zhenzi with fleshy wings flying in the air, and Nongyu riding a phoenix to heaven. We can boast of being the first and the enlightened, looking down on the mundane world. Why do we need to adopt their mechanical scientific crystallization, these bird-man airplanes? Alas, if the September 18th Northeast Incident and the January 28th Shanghai Incident had not happened, I am afraid everyone would still be in a dream. I know the old doctors definitely don't believe that there is such a thing as using force from the air to subdue others. Why do I say this? Because it is indeed true that microorganisms can be cultivated, transplanted, made into serum, and prepared into bacterial solutions. They can be stained and identified under a microscope, and their movement can be seen. It can be said to be absolutely true. However, even now, old doctors still say that this is not the case, that it is all nonsense, and still advocate their five elements, six energies, and the mysterious theories of generation, overcoming, elimination, and growth to cause disease. Some skeptical old doctors insist on misinterpreting their corrupt theories and criticizing public health measures, saying that new doctors are resorting to this inferior strategy because they do not have the healing abilities of old doctors. What a ridiculous thing in the world! On this point alone, I feel that old doctors are afraid when they see airplanes bombing, but they are not afraid of the harm caused by microorganisms on a daily basis. When they see that others have airplanes, they bravely want to buy airplanes to resist, but they are not aware of the progress of scientific medicine and slander and reject it. Look, although the invasion of scientific medicine does not seem as harmful as airplanes bombing, foreigners are rampant everywhere. There is a hospital in the east, and a school in the west. Pharmacies and pharmaceutical factories are increasing daily. Instruments and drugs are constantly supplied. Further, even sanitary administration is almost impossible without foreign participation and control. Isn't the life of a country's people in the hands of foreigners? In this dangerous situation, as I see it, it is no less dangerous than airplanes bombing from the air, or even more harmful. If you want to use the old five elements, six energies, grass roots, and tree bark to resist, it is like asking Gongshuzi, Liezi, Nongyu, and Lei Zhenzi to resist airplanes. Do you think it will be useful? If you understand that it is useless, why not shift the spirit of supporting aviation for national salvation to the medical field, which is closely related to you, and use your own spear to attack your own shield? Here, I further hope that old doctors will not misunderstand my meaning again and scold me as a foreign drug salesman, a traitor who has forgotten his ancestors. You must know that what I hope for in aviation for national salvation is not to buy more foreign airplanes, but to open our own factories and cultivate talent. I also hope that in medicine for national salvation, we should not hire more foreign doctors and use more foreign drugs, but open more scientific medical schools and run more scientific pharmaceutical factories in the country. From now on, I wish the children of old doctors would all go to scientific medical schools to study, and the relatives and friends of old doctors would all become pharmacists, run pharmaceutical factories, and open pharmacies. It seems that there is no need to abandon one's own field to cultivate another's, and it seems that national salvation is not only achieved through aviation, but also through medicine. As the saying goes, "Lay down the butcher's knife and become a Buddha on the spot." From now on, I earnestly hope that you will wake up immediately and turn back as soon as possible. Don't be like rushing to buy airplanes today, even if you want to mend the fold after the sheep is lost, you have already suffered a great deal.</p>
<h3>The Scientific Art of Life (10)</h3>
<p>— Yu Songyun</p>
<p>(II) Disinfection of Instruments</p>
<p>Although there are several methods for disinfecting instruments, the boiling method is the most convenient. For instruments used in obstetrics, whether for surgery or normal delivery, boiling is appropriate. If there is no disinfecting equipment, ordinary pots, pans, or basins can be used instead. When boiling for disinfection, five minutes is generally sufficient. A small amount of soda can be added to the water, which not only increases the disinfection power but also prevents rust.</p>
<p>(III) Disinfection of Bandage Materials</p>
<p>It is customary in our country to use dirty cloth pieces or straw paper as menstrual belts or to wrap the fetus, which is truly terrifying. Now, whether it is new cloth, cotton yarn, or scraps of old cloth, if they can be thoroughly disinfected, it is not impossible to use them.</p>
<p>(IV) Disinfection of the Mother</p>
<p>The mother's whole body and limbs should be clean, and she must change her maternity clothes. At the beginning of labor, the vulva and the surrounding area should be washed with soap and warm water, and then disinfected with carbolic acid solution (2%) or Lysol (1%). Special attention should be paid to disinfecting the pubic hair, folds, vulva, and vaginal opening to ensure complete cleanliness and prevent germs from entering the vagina.</p>
<p>(B) Management of the Mother</p>
<p>(I) The Delivery Room</p>
<p>When labor begins, within the possible range, the mother should be moved to a fixed room, which is the so-called delivery room. According to general old customs, those who do not want to go to an obstetrics hospital for childbirth often use their ordinary bedroom as a delivery room. However, it is advisable to choose a room with good air circulation and sufficient sunlight. Although it may be slightly narrow, it does not matter. However, it must be quiet and clean, which is most important. The room temperature must also be appropriate. Although the windows should not be tightly closed, direct wind is also a major taboo. In addition, if there are objects with excessively strong fragrances or useless equipment, it is advisable to move them to another room. At night, the electric light must be bright. Except for the midwife and close relatives of the mother, no one is allowed to enter the room to prevent noise.</p>
<p>Common Sense Questions and Answers on Diseases</p>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(IV) Smallpox (commonly known as Tianhua)</p>
<p>(Q) Children often get smallpox. What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>(A) Smallpox is a severe infectious disease. The pathogen is still not clear. Some say it is a small body.</p>
<p>(Q) After being infected with this disease, how many days does it take to develop?</p>
<p>(A) It takes ten to fourteen days of incubation to develop.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the initial symptoms?</p>
<p>(A) The initial stage is the prodromal period, which lasts about three days. There are initial chills, shivering, high fever (39 to 40 degrees Celsius), severe headaches and back pain, cerebral symptoms (delirium and convulsions), digestive symptoms (vomiting and diarrhea), and frequent pulse (130-140). Sometimes there is also bronchitis or splenomegaly, and angina. About the second day of onset, temporary measles-like or scarlet fever-like small spots appear on the abdomen, upper arm, or inner thigh, which are called prodromal rashes.</p>
<p>(Q) What happens after these symptoms?</p>
<p>(A) On the fourth day, the body temperature drops slightly and enters the rash period.</p>
<p>(Q) How long does the rash period last?</p>
<p>(A) The rash period lasts about ten to twelve days.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the order and state of the rash?</p>
<p>(A) Four days after the onset, small, almost round, millet-sized red spots first appear on the face and forehead, and then spread to the trunk and upper and lower limbs. The next day, they become papules the size of peas; by the sixth day, they become blisters with a central depression. By the ninth day, the pox completely fills and becomes a pustule. The pustules are also the size of peas, surrounded by a red halo, and feel painful. Thus, by the eleventh or twelfth day after the onset, the scab peels off and the body temperature dissipates and subsides. The skin is very itchy.</p>
<p>(Q) Besides the rash on the skin, what other symptoms are there in other parts of the body with smallpox?</p>
<p>(A) Before and after the skin rash period, the same rash also occurs on the mucous membranes, especially easily affecting the nasal cavity, oral cavity, trachea, esophagus, conjunctiva, and sometimes the rectal mucosa and cornea, forming ulcers. If pox occur on the cornea, vision is impaired or even blindness occurs. Other parts have symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, salivation, sore throat, diarrhea, hoarseness, and cough. There are also complications such as mumps, otitis media, arthritis, and laryngitis.</p>
<p>(Q) What happens to the patient after the rash period?</p>
<p>(A) After the rash period has passed, it is the crusting period. In normal patients, around the sixteenth day after the onset, scabs begin to peel off, leaving dark red spots that take a long time to disappear.</p>
<p>(Q) Why do people who have had smallpox have pockmarks?</p>
<p>(A) Because when the suppuration is too deep, it invades the inner layer of the dermis, and after the scab falls off, the skin surface is deficient and sunken.</p>
<p>(Q) When is a person with smallpox in danger?</p>
<p>(A) Those with severe prodromal symptoms, or confluent and hemorrhagic pox, and purpura under the skin are all in danger.</p>
<p>(Q) What methods are used to prevent smallpox?</p>
<p>(A) Only vaccination can prevent smallpox.</p>
<p>(Q) Who invented the method of vaccination?</p>
<p>(A) It was invented by the British doctor Mr. Jenner in 1796 AD.</p>
<p>(Q) When should children be vaccinated?</p>
<p>(A) Children can be vaccinated three months after birth.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the best season to vaccinate each year?</p>
<p>(A) Spring is the best, and autumn is second best.</p>
<p>(Q) How should those who have already contracted smallpox be treated?</p>
<p>(A) Only symptomatic treatment. Like treating other febrile diseases: apply an ice pack to the head when there is a fever and take antipyretics: take sedatives when restless.</p>
<p>(Q) Does the skin need to be treated?</p>
<p>(A) When the skin is itchy or painful, use cold wet compresses or light olive oil, Vaseline, etc. The hands should not be allowed to scratch, and it is best to wrap the fingers with cloth.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the meaning of some villagers wrapping smallpox patients in red cloth?</p>
<p>(A) Although this is a folk custom in our country, it is in line with science. Because it is now known that the smallpox virus is less likely to exert its toxicity under red light. Therefore, if the windows and the patient's body are covered in red, the danger to the patient can be reduced.</p>
<h3>Several Important Discoveries and Inventions in the Development of Modern Medicine (1)</h3>
<p>— Gu Shoubai</p>
<p>This manuscript was originally published in the New Year's issue of the "Middle School Student Magazine" published by Kaiming Bookstore. Because the content is somewhat popular, reading it can make everyone understand the true value of scientific medicine. We only recognize that scientific medicine is the real science. It also coincides with the purpose of the "Shen Bao Medical and Pharmaceutical Weekly"; therefore, we have specially obtained the consent of the editor of the "Middle School Student Magazine" to reprint it in this journal. I am now making a special statement here. (Shoubai Note)</p>
<p>Modern medicine, which seems like "new medicine" in our country, was also once dominated by philosophical thought in ancient times, just like today's "old medicine" in our country; but later, with the progress of science, it broke away from mysterious theories and moved towards practical testing, so that it could develop to the level it is today. Now I will introduce a brief overview of several of the most important discoveries and inventions, so that the general public can fully understand this scientific new medicine, and at the same time can feel the value of the old medicine and find ways to improve it.</p>
<p>(I) General Anesthesia and Local Anesthesia</p>
<p>The greatest obstacle to surgery is the fear of pain. Although patients also know that the disease they suffer from cannot be cured without surgery, or at least can be alleviated after surgery, most of them are afraid of pain and ultimately dare not try it. Therefore, the invention of anesthesia is of great value in the development of new medicine.</p>
<p>Honmor once described the pain-relieving effect of the tranquilizer "Nepenthe." Dioscordos and Pliny also said that Mandragora can relieve pain during surgery. Dioscordos said: When cutting or cauterizing, if preparations from the root of Mandragora are used, it can put the patient into a deep sleep without feeling pain; Pliny also said: Sometimes just smelling this medicine will cause sleep.</p>
<p>Apuleius said: Mandragora can make a person not feel pain even if a limb is cut off during sleep. Arab medical books also record the pain-relieving effect of the drug.</p>
<p>In Europe during the Middle Ages, various pain-preventing preparations were used during surgery. Some were secret recipes, so the ingredients they contained cannot be pointed out; but it can be seen from the records that the main ingredients were nothing more than Mandragora, opium, and henbane.</p>
<p>Benjamin Be of Edinburgh said in the seventeenth edition of his surgery book published in 1801 that the pain-relieving effect of opium is the most significant.</p>

<h3>Important News</h3>
<p>Director Zhou Fohai of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education</p>
<p>Inspects Education in Southern Jiangsu (5)</p>
<p>Attends Welcome Meeting at County Party Headquarters and Delivers Speech</p>
<p>Departs from Changzhou on the Afternoon of the 25th</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from Changzhou) Director Zhou Fohai of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education and his party came to Changzhou to inspect various schools, as reported in this newspaper. This morning (25th), at 8:00 AM, they first went to inspect the County Women's Vocational School. At 10:00 AM, they attended the welcome meeting of all circles convened by the County Party Headquarters. Many people came from the four villages. After the chairman introduced him, Zhou took the stage and spoke, saying that during this national crisis, China should make every effort to revive the nation. Just as the Soviet Union used the slogan "Land and Bread," the Fascists flaunted "Production and Order," and Hitler used "Tearing up the Treaty of Versailles," all to indicate the goals of their nation's efforts. China's current slogan should be "Settle internal affairs and resist external aggression, suppress bandits and defend against humiliation." Party members bear the responsibility of leading the nation and should make special efforts. He also said that promoting the national spirit and preserving inherent virtues are the driving forces for national rejuvenation. For example, the Wan'an Pagoda of the monk's robe behind Changzhou Middle School is a national historical site of Song monks resisting the Yuan, and the Wang Xiang Temple next to Tianning Primary School is a symbol of national morality, and they should be carefully protected at all times. The more than 400 listeners were very moved. At this time, section chiefs Chen and Xiang and Director Yi, accompanied by Yang Haoming from the Education Bureau, inspected four private primary schools: Shengshi Renfan Primary School, Baiyun Ferry Junior Primary School, Shuangguifang Junior Primary School, and Yinjiaqiao Junior Primary School. At 12:00, they rested at their residence. At the County Middle School Anti-Japanese National Salvation Speech Contest and Lecture Meeting hosted by the Education Association, Director Zhou specially selected and purchased several books on anti-Japanese themes and related to the Northeast as prizes. He then took a fast train at 1:40 PM this afternoon and left Changzhou for Suzhou. (March 25th)</p>

<h3>National Scout Design Committee</h3>
<p>Is Being Prepared</p>
<p>The Scout Association Sends Instructors for Guidance and Supervision</p>
<p>Since Dai Jitao and Zhu Jiahua took charge of the preparatory work for the preparatory office of the Chinese Boy Scout Association, they have enriched the internal and actively worked with remarkable results. Recently, Dai and others have realized that the scout cause is a specialty, and especially in the organization and training aspects, it is necessary to gather national experts, discuss in detail, and write a definite chapter that will last forever and be practical. Therefore, last month, they hired Li Qifan, Shen Tongyi, Liao Maoru, Zhang Zhongren, Gu Shusen, Zhang Jiwu, Zhang Junchou, Peng Zongze, Wang Gang, Shen Shuku, Yan Jialin, Gai Qixin, Chen Chaozhong, Xu Yu, Yun, Chen Bang, Xu Zi, Du Ting, Zhao Fansheng, Li Rentao, Leng Xue, Tang Changyan, etc. as members of the Design Committee. On one hand, they ordered the sections to properly divide and modify various regulations, curricula, charts, etc., to prepare for discussion at the meeting. It is reported that the meeting is scheduled to be held at the Nanjing Lizhi Society from April 7th to 9th for the first time. In order to facilitate the early preparation of the committee members, the General Association first sent out a batch of drafts on the 25th, including the draft of the General Association's organizational regulations, the general chapter, the three-level curriculum standards, the curriculum standards for Girl Scouts and Young Scouts, and the organizational regulations for the regiment headquarters. The remaining chapters and regulations still need to be sent out in batches so that the committee members can preview them. It is heard that at this meeting, Dai advocated that it must be a plan for a hundred years, because he felt deeply hindered in the promotion of the Scout cause due to repeated changes in the past fifteen years. He also personally wrote the essentials of moral education and a letter to the national service staff and design committee members to discuss and modify the twelve virtues. The content is said to be quite fluent and of great value. It is also reported that the opening ceremony of the Second Provincial Scout Inspection and Jamboree in Zhejiang Province will be held on April 3rd at the Zhejiang Provincial Stadium. The Chinese Boy Scout Association has sent Xue Yuanlong, the chief secretary of the training section, to attend and guide the event. It is also heard that Dai Jitao, the vice president of the association, also plans to go. The Shanghai Boy Scout Council will hold a re-election on April 1st. The Chinese Boy Scout Association has sent Jiang Wushi, the chief secretary of the organization section, to go and supervise the election.</p>

<p>Two Great Kings of World Tennis</p>
<h3>Vans and Tilden Will Face Off in a Battle</h3>
<p>Annual Meeting of the American Lawn Tennis Association</p>
<p>Passed a Resolution to Hold the U.S. Open</p>
<p>Providing Opportunity for Amateur and Professional to Meet</p>
<p>Date in Early Summer Mid-May Location Philadelphia</p>
<p>(New York Dispatch) The long-awaited meeting between two great kings, Vans and Tilden, the past and present, of the ideal world tennis will soon become a reality. At the 52nd annual meeting of the American Lawn Tennis Association on February 11th, a resolution was passed to hold a U.S. Open tennis tournament this year, providing an opportunity for the amateur and professional worlds to meet. Vans is the great king of today's world amateur tennis, while Tilden is the leader of professional tennis. Therefore, this resolution is nothing less than paving the way for the two great kings to meet.</p>
<p>Date of the Open Competition: The resolution for the open competition was moved by the Philadelphia District Committee and unanimously passed at the annual meeting. The only opponent was Mr. Ward, the president of the Eastern Association of the American Lawn Tennis Association. Ward was elected as the new vice president at the annual meeting. The competition will be held in Philadelphia in the future. As for the date, the U.S. Tennis Championships are crowded in August and mid-September, and the Southwest Pacific Championships are held in mid-October, so it will likely be held in early summer, mid-May. Tilden is currently touring the United States and will go to Europe in mid-June, so holding it earlier in May is also to give him an opportunity.</p>
<p>International Disapproval: The resolution of the annual meeting to hold open competitions with mixed amateur and professional players has shocked the world of tennis. The International Lawn Tennis Federation, controlled by the French, was the first to express disapproval, followed by Britain. However, according to the opinions of several leaders in the world of tennis, the American Lawn Tennis Association has the right to hold this competition on its own and does not need international approval.</p>

<h3>The Golden Signboard</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhihen</p>
<p>In our country, there are many stores that promote "honesty and fair trade"; however, there are quite a few exceptions. For example, when you patronize a store, you can "ask for prices to the heavens, and bargain down to the earth," and sometimes the final price is less than half of what they initially asked for. Although the deal is made, if you look back at their store, you'll see a grandly displayed golden "Fixed Price" signboard. In our country, there's also another grand "No Deceit of Old or Young" signboard hanging, but if a child happens to patronize their store, they'll either charge a higher price or discount the goods. And if a country bumpkin comes to their store, humph! Friend, you must be careful about whether the silver dollars and banknotes they give you as change are counterfeit. The skill of "deceit" is advanced and subtle, but the "No Deceit" signboard still shines grandly in golden light.</p>
<p>"Friends! Japan has seized our three northeastern provinces, Japan has seized our Rehe, Japan wants to swallow up all of China, we are about to become slaves of a conquered nation, we must quickly resist Japan, we must earnestly boycott Japanese goods, if we buy Japanese goods again, we are heartless beasts." These impassioned calls to boycott Japanese goods are piled layer upon layer into our two ears, heaven! You gave us ears that are too small, look! How can so many waves of boycotting Japanese goods fit in?</p>
<p>Today, I saw a translation of a March 13th Osaka Mainichi Shimbun article in the newspaper: "...In the Chinese economic sector, it is possible to escape the harsh environment, so recently Japanese goods transactions have gradually become lively. For example, the sales of textiles...have shown a surge, cotton cloth...is more than in January, miscellaneous goods...purchasing power has gradually recovered...all have turned from pessimistic to gradually return to their original state."</p>
<p>Ah! I'm confused, I'm muddled, my eyes are blurred, did I read the words wrong? No! No! Is the translation unfaithful? Did the typesetter make a mistake? No! No! I'm awake, I understand, the "boycott Japanese goods slogan" is just a golden signboard of "fixed price" and "no deceit of old or young" in the stores.</p>
<h3>Watching a Chess Game</h3>
<p>— Shi Yan Ye</p>
<p>丨 One Pawn, One Bullet, Still Resisting 丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, at a friend's place, I saw A and B playing Chinese chess, and I was just a bystander. A was calm and composed, moving only after careful consideration, never regretting a move. B's anxiety was evident on his face, moving east and shifting west before making a move. Just by observing their attitudes, one could judge who was stronger and who was weaker. After moving the chariot, jumping the horse, firing the cannon, and advancing the pawn for a while, A's forces had already penetrated deep into B's territory. B had lost a chariot and a horse, and only two-fifths of his pawns remained. The commander in the rear was running east and west, unable to find a safe place to stay. The situation was truly precarious. B was extremely anxious and used his wisdom to reorganize the remnants, calmly respond to the battle, and defend against enemies from all sides with a single chariot and horse. With the assistance of the guards, he was able to maintain the situation without letting A enter the palace. Later, B realized that holding out for a long time was not a good strategy, so he changed his tactics, resolutely charging out at the opportunity. In a chaotic battle, the remaining chariots and horses were all sacrificed, and only one cannon remained. On the other hand, A also suffered great losses. One chariot was lost, the entire cavalry was wiped out, and although the cannon was not destroyed, it was temporarily useless. More than half of the guards and infantry were also killed or wounded. Observing the formations of both sides, they were broken and scattered. B's army was in complete disarray, while A reorganized and could fight again. However, B refused to admit defeat, mustered his remaining courage, drove his remaining troops, and continued to provoke, never giving up. After a bloody battle, only one pawn remained on the front line, and only two advisors accompanied the commander in the rear. All others had made heroic sacrifices. A still had one chariot, one cannon, and one pawn. Looking at the overall situation and considering the strength of both sides, if they stopped fighting, B's commander could still save his life. But B, with a determination to die, angrily said to A: "I have one pawn and two advisors, and I can still fight." Thus, the dying battle entered a fierce contact again. B's soldiers made their last sacrifice in no time, and the commander was also captured, ending the battle for supremacy.</p>
<p>A's tactics were sophisticated, which I greatly admired, but B's fighting courage made me admire him even more. Because he has a steadfast and indomitable heart, a spirit of regarding death as returning home, and a determination to not give up until the Yellow River. Declaring that one pawn, one bullet, will also resist, he fought until he had neither one pawn nor one bullet. How he spoke, so he did, truly worthy of calling him a great man! A great hero! What made me even more emotional was that the two people playing chess was just a game, but B actually made it real, implementing the one-pawn-one-bullet battle. Since the January 28th Incident, the Sino-Japanese war has been a matter of our survival and life and death, but the soldiers regarded it as a children's game, and treated the magnificent slogan of "one pawn, one bullet, also resists" as if a child was singing a folk song. Alas! If our soldiers had the spirit of B's chess game, saying and doing, the country would be saved.</p>

<h3>The Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Finally Taking It Upon Himself to Untie the Knot, Secretly Pitying Her Maidenly Innocence, Willing to Share His Food</p>
<p>When Gan Jizhi was thinking in his study, he felt that for the sake of his own consideration and the consideration of others, he had to tell the girl from the Yang family and ask her not to come in the future. However, the first difficult problem was solved, and the second problem followed, which was how to say the words of persuading her not to come. Could it be that he should tell her that his brother would not allow her to come? He thought and thought, simply having no way. But no matter what, he could not offend his brother, and moreover, his own life completely relied on his brother for support. If he offended his brother, even his livelihood would be problematic, so how could he deal with it? In Beiping City, now, if you take the wrong path, you can easily find a few unemployed people. Having a position, having a bowl of rice to eat, is very difficult now. How can one easily lose such a position? Thinking this way, he broke through the difficult barrier that was difficult to open his mouth and felt that he could always find a way to deceive the old girl. Even if she saw through it in the future, it wouldn't matter. He would privately tell her his difficulties, and if she was someone who sympathized with him, she would understand what he said. Conversely, if she couldn't understand him, then she wouldn't be a confidante. With the idea settled, he felt a little more at ease. He didn't dare to go to the Yang family that day, fearing that his brother would see him, which would be very inconvenient. The next day, he woke up very early. No one in the family had gotten up yet, so he quietly opened the front door and went to the Yang family. Although the Yang family got up earlier than the Gan family, the difference between early and late for people living in the countryside was only half an hour. Jizhi woke up too early today, and the doors of the Yang family were also tightly closed. He didn't have anything public or important to discuss with people, so he couldn't just knock on people's doors early in the morning. He paced back and forth in front of the door two or three times, but it still didn't open. However, other neighbors opened their doors, saw Jizhi, and said with a smile: "Second Master, good morning!" Jizhi nodded and casually replied, "Not too early." Then, a water carrier passed by the door and also said with a smile: "Hey! Second Master, you're up so early!" (24)</p>
<h3>The Art of Speaking</h3>
<p>— Huan Fu</p>
<p>丨Flattery and Bluster Only丨</p>
<p>When a person speaks, they must have a thick face and clear articulation, not caring if others are disgusted by what they hear, and even if all 180,000 hairs on their body stand on end, as long as they pay attention to flattering those who are listening and making them feel warm and cozy, with every sentence hitting their hearts, causing a chemical reaction of bone-softening and body-numbing, then it is the art of speaking, and also the art of dealing with the world.</p>
<p>The art of speaking, like the theorems of geometry, can be summarized in one sentence: "Flatter those above, and bluster to those below." When applied to the philosophy of dealing with the world, it will never be wrong. What is called bluster? What is called flattery? The variations are endless, wonderfully diverse, divine and enlightened, depending on the person, and it is definitely not possible for this humble pen to describe. However, judging from the facts, one can also report that everyone knows that "the art of speaking" is applicable in the business world, but in fact, aren't politics, academics, etc., also the same? How can this be seen? "Sir," "humble subordinate," "cultivation," "yes," "yes," "yes," this is the "art of speaking" of the old bureaucrats. Although the word "sir" has disappeared now, chairman, ×× chief, etc., have come along with the new and the old. The humble subordinate is still a humble subordinate, cultivation still needs cultivation, and yes, yes, yes, still has unexpectedly effective power. As for the academic world, it is the intellectual class, especially rich in the talent of "the art of speaking." To the school principals and directors of education, they are respectful and courteous, and strive to imitate the example of humble subordinates seeing their superiors. When teaching in the classroom, the textbooks can be left to sleep and rest on the platform, but the mouth must be eloquent and endlessly lecturing about the Classic of Mountains and Seas, love, dancing, movies, and how the brother used to be number one when studying in America, and how even the British, French, Japanese, and Indian friends of the same grade could not catch up with him. When in a good mood, one might as well talk about one's own romantic love history, discuss the secret methods of remedying a broken heart, and the taste and pain of unrequited love, and inject a few shots of morphine into the hearts of a class of high disciples. Of course, everyone welcomes it, everyone supports it, the rice bowl is secure, the feelings are good, isn't this the effect of understanding the art of speaking? In the past, there was a dormitory manager with very little qualifications. One day, the principal convened all the students for a speech, and the manager also came to give a speech. He said: "Brothers, I do everything according to the orders of Principal, gentlemen. You must not violate the orders of Principal, gentlemen!" Principal, gentlemen, short, Principal, gentlemen, long, said so that those who listened to it had their hair standing on end. In fact, this speech was to put a high hat on Principal, gentlemen, on the one hand, and to use Principal as a talisman, which is really a "speaking art" that achieves two goals at once. Later, a student was unwilling to pour the spittoon in the dormitory, and grumbled, saying something unpleasant. The manager laughed and said: "Brother, you are unwilling to pour the spittoon now. What will you do when you are asked to pour the chamber pot for your wife in the future!" Junfang's language is wonderful in the world, and can be said to be the ultimate in "humor."</p>
<p>Women's Paradise</p>
<h3>Women's Motto</h3>
<p>— Yin Feng</p>
<p>Someone cleverly compared the realm of women to air, but what should women do in this vast scope? How to do it? How should they be people? What talents should they have? What kind of life should they live? These questions are difficult to answer. Now, there is someone who has studied women and family problems and succeeded. He has found perfect answers for us. What he said is indeed our women's golden rule, and the medicine and acupuncture for dealing with the world, so I have extracted a few of them for our women to use as a motto.</p>
<p>A very clever and intelligent female writer, Skreinai, summarized many different demands of modern women in the world and said: "Provide us with work and education to engage in work. We ask this not only for ourselves, but for all mankind." The biggest problem in human society is to enable each member to find a suitable place. This place is to give everyone a suitable job and to enable everyone to be at ease and enthusiastic about the work in this place. If she can fully implement her talents, fully express her talents, and develop her nature; she is the most pleasant and useful woman. Therefore, women should pay attention to their female instincts.</p>
<p>Women are by no means imitators. Their work is women's work. Existence without purpose is worse than death. We have come to this planet to do some valuable work. Brainpower that is not used will disappear. If a person stops moving forward, they will regress and fall. So there is no other way in the world but to work hard and move forward. No one else can do this work for us. Lazy people are despised everywhere.</p>
<p>The matter of choosing a lifelong partner is more important to our happiness and pain than anything else. To know the highest meaning of marriage is the harmonious mixture of two souls, not only for the body, but also for the mutual attraction of spirit and intellect. The basis of this marriage must be established on the love of mutual respect and thorough understanding between men and women. Ms. Ellen Key said: "We women should brand a fiery mark on our hearts, and this mark is to say that no matter what kind of union, if it lacks love, the result must be failure." Therefore, women have many conditions to consider when choosing a lifelong partner, health, temperament, interests, physique, patience, adaptability, and other important aspects that were rarely noticed by previous people.</p>
<p>A bride must have a proper knowledge and training before marriage, so that she knows what she is doing when she holds the wedding. She must understand everything she does in advance, and do not do it blindly. It is extremely dangerous for a woman who has not undergone practical training and has not learned to be independent and self-reliant, once she breaks away from the shackles and gains freedom, especially in the case of a woman under the strict control of her parents.</p>
<p>A woman may have received specialized training in a profession and have a skill; but if she wants to be a virtuous wife, she must have some other important skills. Like an economist said: "This skill does not have to be learned in a specialized school, but its value is more precious and important than anything else. Without this skill, her education is not complete." Wornall summarized these skills and obtained the following points: (1) She must know that one hundred cents adds up to one yuan. (2) She must know how to cook, how to arrange rooms, how to make clothes, and how to take care of sick rooms. (3) She should be diligent in reading, but not be a bookworm who only knows how to read dead books. (4) She should know how to prepare clothes within the scope of her income, and be able to wear cheap domestic fabrics to make suitable clothes in a generous manner. (5) She should know how to be good at being with herself, not seeking to please men, but to be suitable for herself.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>On "Law"</h3>
<p>— Chen Wangdao</p>
<p>Dr. Hu Shih can be considered to have a special connection with "law". He lectured on grammar from the moment he took the stage, and he is still lecturing on "law" today. However, the "law" he lectured on at the beginning was grammar, which was not worth five thousand yuan, and the "law" he is lecturing on now is law, which will soon be worth more than five thousand yuan. However, this "law" that is worth more than five thousand yuan comes from lecturing on that "law" that is not worth five thousand yuan. There is a hidden secret to his "successful experiment" here, which is worth our careful study. There will soon be a lively critique of Hu Shih, probably to clarify this secret.</p>
<p>Recalling when he lectured on grammar, he had a tendency to lecture on "law" while being detached from "facts." Just like his first article "Letter to Chen Duxiu", which only listed one point "5. Must talk about grammatical structure", without explanation, of course nothing can be seen. His second article "Humble Proposals for Literary Improvement" had already made that tendency clear. In this article, he particularly emphasized grammar. He said: "Those who write essays and poems today often do not pay attention to grammatical structure. Not paying attention to grammar is called 'incomprehensible'. This is very clear and does not need detailed discussion." And his explanation of non-grammaticality does not speak in accordance with the facts, but only quotes a sentence from Zhang Taiyan to block. It is said that</p>
<p>"Refer to brothers as Kong Huai, refer to those in power as Zeng Shi," (Zhang Taiyan's words) is an example.</p>
<p>Since Dr. Hu Shih particularly valued grammar, he would not fail to diligently search for examples of non-grammaticality. However, he only used a sentence from Zhang Taiyan to block here. This cannot be considered a temporary inability to find evidence, but rather has an important reason. The reason is that he likes to use big names to control people and is too lazy to speak in accordance with the facts.</p>
<p>I think that these two things are Dr. Hu Shih's consistent writing spirit over the years. We cannot simply say that what he said was too brief and that he did not carefully analyze where one can call "brothers" "Kong Huai" and one can call "those in power" "Zeng Shi", and where one cannot call and cannot say, and lightly pass him by.</p>
<p>Now he is using this method to lecture on "law" again. I am really worried about all Chinese people!</p>
<p>I am not a member of the anarchist party, so I do not mind lecturing on "law". However, according to my shallow knowledge, there are two ways of lecturing on "law": one can be called lecturing on law from a judicial perspective. It recognizes the law as already established and then looks at which law should be applied to a certain matter. In this way, bad laws are also laws. Even if it is clearly a bad law, one cannot help but send people to be victims of the bad law. Another can be called lecturing on law from a legislative perspective. That is, from the perspective of the legislator, to see whether a certain law should be established or not, and if it is established, how it should be applied in order to benefit society and benefit life. In this way, bad laws can be said not to be laws, because they are not beneficial to society and not beneficial to life. Which way does Dr. Hu Shih want to lecture on law?</p>
<p>Judging from the way he lectures on grammar, he will not adopt the second way of lecturing. We have seen him emulate foreign grammar by forcefully establishing a general rule for the word "le" that Dr. Zhao Yuanren believed to have eight or nine uses, called the "subjunctive mood," and locking everything into it. Now, when lecturing on law, is he still trying to use this "philosophical" method, the "experimental" method? If he is still like this, then it really cannot be said that he is a "poisonous" creature that is more poisonous than a snake!</p>
<h3>Children's Play</h3>
<p>— Feng Zikai</p>
<p>Suddenly, a burst of riotous noise erupted from the children downstairs. Mother called out in a loud voice, "The two roosters are fighting again! Dad, come quickly and mediate!" I didn't even have time to put down the newspaper in my hand and hurried downstairs.</p>
<p>It turned out that two boys were fighting: six-year-old Yuancao wanted to snatch the wooden toy from nine-year-old Huazhan, but Huazhan wouldn't give it to him. Yuancao cried and hit Huazhan's chest with his hand; Huazhan also cried, holding up the wooden toy with both hands and kicking Yuancao's leg.</p>
<p>I put down the newspaper, inserted myself between the two children, hugged them both in my arms, and said to them, "Stop fighting! What's the matter? Tell me!" Yuancao tried his best to break free from my arms and attack the other boy, crying and shouting, "He won't give me the wooden toy! He won't give me the wooden toy!" As if that was a valid reason to hit someone. Huazhan, being three years older than him, initially stayed quietly in my arms, indicating that he would not resist and would listen to my mediation, but later he started to defend himself, saying, "These wooden toys are originally mine! He wants to snatch them, I won't give them to him, so he hits me!" Yuancao continued crying, "He kicked me!" Huazhan took a direct approach, saying to him, "You hit me first!" Elder Sister Bao, who was watching from the sidelines, offered her opinion, "A light hit for a heavy hit, hitting first is unreasonable!" (Note: In our Shimenwan dialect, hitting once is called "hitting a sentence.") Another opinion arose from behind, "Gentlemen use words, villains use their hands!" Before I could make a judgment, Yuancao had already forcefully broken free from my arms and suddenly launched an attack on the other boy. Seeing that my mediation was ineffective, Mother rushed over, grabbed Yuancao, held him in her arms, and comforted him with words. The two children separately occupied the arms of their respective parents, and the riot finally came to an end. At this moment, the friendly sound of "Spiced... dried tofu" rang out outside the back door, calling both children, their faces still streaked with tears, away from our arms. When I took the newspaper and went back upstairs, I could already hear them laughing and chatting after they had made up.</p>
<p>But when I got upstairs, I didn't continue reading the newspaper. Because I felt that the event I had just witnessed was much more direct and clear than reading about international disputes in the newspaper. I leaned over my desk and pondered:</p>
<p>The way people treat each other in this world, on a small scale, is individual to individual, and on a large scale, is group to group. The smallest interaction between individuals is between children, and the largest interaction between groups is between countries. In a civilized world, except for the two extremes of the smallest and the largest, interactions between people are generally conducted by speaking and reasoning, rather than by physical force and fighting. For example, if one wants to plunder, one must use clever means; if one wants to invade, one must establish clever pretexts; what is called "attack" is only debate, and what is called "defeat" is only shouting. Therefore, even if people harbor resentment and harm towards each other, they still nod and shake hands when they meet, paying lip service to appearances. Although there are also people who use force, "Gentlemen use words, villains use their hands," the use of force is not common in a civilized world. Among them, only the two extremes of the smallest and the largest are different: in interactions between children, one can be unreasonable, disregard appearances, and resort to physical force to fight; in interactions between countries, one can also be unreasonable, disregard appearances, and resort to war. War is a large-scale fight. Therefore, the largest and the smallest are similar: country to country is the same as child to child.</p>
<p>The ancients said, "Great wisdom appears foolish, great skill appears clumsy," and "Only the most wise and the most foolish do not change." Modern people also say, "Non-resistance is resistance," and "Suffering a loss is a gain." It can be seen that the two opposite extremes of everything are similar or equal. Therefore, international affairs are like children's play, or equivalent to children's play.</p>
<h3>Shaw's Boasting</h3>
<p>— Xia Kaizun</p>
<p>Shaw traveled to Japan and sent a manuscript to the "Reconstruction Magazine," titled "Engels, Shaw, Lenin." His state of boasting is evident. The original text is translated as follows and is also one of the socialist literatures.</p>
<p>Friedrich Engels collaborated with Marx on the Communist Manifesto. He used the materials left by Marx to supplement the latter two volumes of Capital. During the long years when Marx was exiled in London, he saved Marx from starvation and fulfilled the task of "master of the earth" for Marx's children. He himself also wrote several books, which gave the Marxists of the nineteenth century a great deal of influence. His writing style is lighter than Marx's, and in some places, he seems like a humorist. In the history of socialist thought, his name will be inseparable from Marx's.</p>
<p>When I arrived in Japan and talked to my socialist friends about how I had met Engels and talked to him, these friends listened, their eyes shining with curiosity about Engels. This was not unexpected for me, but I had almost no material to tell them. When I entered the life of an active socialist in the early 1880s as one of the founders of the Fabian Society, Marx was no longer in this world, but Engels was still alive. However, he did not know about this newly emerging British movement. He and Marx had already founded the "First International" twenty years ago. After the working class suffered a great defeat in Paris in 1871, the "International" collapsed. Only the Social Democratic Party, which was newly rising in the German Parliament, barely survived. Marx and Engels reluctantly took this as a political position. Ten years later, Marx made an Englishman of the Victorian cosmopolitan liberal type, who called himself Henry Mayers Hyndman, convert to Marxist socialism. Hyndman founded a political group called the "Democratic Federation," which was soon called the "Social Democratic Federation."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the name of Marx, the founder of the "Red International" and the supporter of the "Paris Commune," was very frightening in Britain at that time. Hyndman felt that his so-called alliance with Marx's name was detrimental to his cause, and as a result, the two quarreled. Originally, both of them were very easily angered. Since then, Marx and Engels did not recognize Hyndman's movement as representing socialism.</p>
<p>In 1884, when the "Fabian Society" was founded, which had no connection with Marx and was achieved by a very small number of bourgeois intellectuals, Marx was no longer alive. In Engels' eyes, this new association was nothing more than a ridiculous thing. Engels would never have dreamed that a few silly and like-minded companions would be treated sincerely by true socialists. In this way, Engels, while believing that he was the center of socialism in England, was completely isolated from the British movement. His isolation was further deepened by another tragic reason. Marx's youngest daughter, Eleanor Marx, was unfortunately seduced by a headless man named Edward Aveling. This man was a thorough socialist, atheist, evolutionist, and an orator who was good at capturing people's hearts. He seemed like a man who would not hesitate to sacrifice his life for his beliefs, but when it came to money or women, his conscience and self-control were completely gone. His debts and seduction incidents were almost countless. Among these victims, many were often deceived by his rhetoric into impoverished laborers. The "National Secular Society" expelled him, and no other socialist group was willing to accept him. Even in Eleanor, there was no place to shelter him except with Engels. So, these two tried to blind Engels to the new developments in the British socialist movement. Their deceitful behavior naturally contained an intention, which was to conceal the German Social Democratic Party at the same time, and to make Engels believe that he was still the supreme leader of British socialism and that Aveling was the only reliable leader.</p>
<p>Later, this illusion was destroyed by Eleanor's suicide and the exposure of Aveling's character. But when I met Engels, this illusion was still strongly at work. Once, at a May Day labor demonstration parade in Hyde Park, I finished my speech from the Fabian Society's podium, and while observing the crowd's tendencies, I walked around at random. Suddenly, I was called by an elderly gentleman in a mauve suit. The gentleman had a beard, and his face seemed very happy. He stared at my face as if it were a source of amusement for a while and said, "Who am I? Maybe you don't know." Usually, when I met people, there were times when I looked familiar but couldn't remember their names for a while. At this time, I put on this expression and solemnly defended myself. He laughed and said, "I am Friedrich Engels." In his eyes, a bourgeois youth who claimed to be a socialist but did not know Friedrich Engels seemed to be the most ridiculous thing in the world.</p>
<p>Not knowing that the movement had left him in loneliness and ignorance, and was moving forward steadily, while he still considered himself the leader of the movement, I thought about this comedy of the "old pioneer" in my heart and walked away.</p>
<p>Let's end the conversation quickly. At this time, in an unknown corner of suburban London, there lived a person I never dreamed of. What I knew about that person was even more meager than Engels' knowledge about me. Engels at least knew that Shaw was one of the leaders of the Fabian Socialist movement and was indeed a ridiculous fellow. But I knew nothing about that fugitive in Highgate.</p>
<p>That fugitive's name was Vladimir Ulyanov, but today, the name Lenin is more common.</p>
<p>The lesson of this conversation is this: no leader knows who his successor will be.</p>

<h3>The Crossroads of the Era and Love</h3>
<p>— Zhang Guanping</p>
<p>Qiu Ying said a lot, but Haiquan didn't pay attention to her. However, when he heard her mention the landlord, he felt a shiver run down his spine. At the same time, he imagined the dark situation on the stairs, which was really a bit scary. He just vaguely replied, "I'll consider it later."</p>
<p>Haiquan treated them to a simple meal, but seeing that Qiu Ying was still reluctant to leave this small restaurant, she kept asking Lin Haiquan all sorts of questions. At this moment, she understood that Haiquan was indeed a pure young man.</p>
<p>"Let's go."</p>
<p>"No. Please wait a moment. Mr. Lin, why are you in such a hurry?"</p>
<p>After she said that, she held the child and walked in front of Haiquan. He smelled another mixture of powder fragrance and the smell of urine.</p>
<p>"... Uncle Lin, give me a hug. Mock me,..."</p>
<p>Her face was full of smiles, and she tilted her head and shrank her neck, looking very unnatural. Haiquan had no choice. Although he was unwilling, he took the child.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?"</p>
<p>Cao Shiguang saw that his wife was too impolite and felt a little embarrassed, so he hurriedly scolded her.</p>
<p>"I have my own things to do. Why do you have to ask about it? You man, you are always so unreasonable, always interfering in other people's business. Although we are husband and wife, there is still a limit! How can a woman be subject to her husband's interference in everything?..."</p>
<p>Qiu Ying glared at Shiguang with a full of momentum and said a lot. Shiguang just pursed his lips and boredly peeled the black melon seeds left in the plate, without saying a word.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Uncle Lin... I'm going to wash my hands and I'll be right back..."</p>
<p>She smiled at Haiquan again. She used two different faces to her husband and Haiquan today. As she walked inside, she lifted the hem of her qipao, first inserting her hands into the waistband of her inner pants. Haiquan stood behind and couldn't help but look at her, feeling that her actions were always so blatant and provocative.</p>
<p>Haiquan initially thought that Cao Shiguang's house had at least two rooms and also had spare rooms. But after looking at his house, he knew it was hopeless. He thought, I'll go to Tang Yaoxing's place and squeeze in for a few nights. Even if I sleep in the same bed with him, it's okay.</p>
<p>Haiquan said goodbye to Cao Shiguang and his wife and walked to the school alone. He thought that after arriving at the school, he could see Tang Yaoxing. He planned to ask Yaoxing to inquire about the situation at Mrs. Hezi's house. Because since he came out of Mrs. Hezi's house, he had been constantly thinking about her. Even when Mrs. Cao was making a demonstration to him, he was still thinking about her. He always felt that Mrs. Cao was not as elegant as Mrs. Hezi.</p>

<h3>The Problem of Assisting Rural Finance</h3>
<p>— Zhongda</p>
<p>In recent years, the voice of assisting the rural economy has been rising. Whether public or private, high or low, all regard prospering the countryside and rescuing agriculture as the only essential factor in today's development of the national economy. Indeed, the crux of the deterioration of our national economy lies in the stagnation of the agricultural economy, and the stagnation of the agricultural economy lies in the bankruptcy of the rural economy.</p>
<p>Although our country is not a purely agricultural country, there is no doubt that agricultural production is the main body of output. In recent years, from a practical perspective, military disasters, banditry, water and drought disasters have followed one after another, and their impact on the rural economy and agricultural production is by no means insignificant. From a statistical point of view, the export of agricultural products and by-products has been declining in recent years, and the absolute decline in the most famous silk, tea, cotton, and egg products is clear evidence of this. At the same time, the sharp increase in the import of food "rice, wheat, flour" is also sufficient proof of the shortage of food production. Rural bankruptcy, agricultural decline, and farmers' lives are bound to become extreme due to hardship. Selling wives and children, unable to take care of themselves, let alone production. As a result, some farmers leave the village, some fields are barren, and at best, they can only maintain the minimum standard of living. This situation has become a common phenomenon in our country, and we must not avoid it.</p>
<p>In the voice of rescuing agriculture, most commentators focus on the issue of assisting agricultural finance. The important reason for rural bankruptcy is that farmers' finance cannot circulate. If we can start by assisting farmers' finance, so that spring plowing will not miss its time and farmers can live and work in peace, agriculture can naturally develop. We believe that this view is pertinent, but what is the method of assisting farmers' finance, and what are the prerequisites for assisting agricultural finance? One is how to make funds flow smoothly into rural areas. The second is how to make the funds produce considerable results after flowing into rural areas.</p>
<p>How can funds flow smoothly into rural areas? There are three points to pay attention to: (1) There must be sufficient security to make the flow of funds into rural areas universal. The flow of funds depends almost entirely on safety. In dangerous areas or periods, funds cannot be forced to flow in. Even purely agricultural relief agencies rarely take the step of "going down the well to save people," and it is not a principled approach. Therefore, the only method is to ensure safety. The so-called security is that after the funds flow into the rural areas, farmers absolutely maintain credit, can operate stably, so that investors or enthusiastic rural workers do not regard it as a daunting task, and borrowing is not interrupted. In this way, the flow of funds into rural areas, under considerable security, not only has the possibility of continued investment, but can also attract the joint participation of other enthusiasts who are keen to rescue the rural economy, and the flow of funds into rural areas has also become universal. (2) Farmers must have the ability to receive financial relief. The so-called ability to receive financial relief is the full development of farmers' own credit. On the one hand, it can attract the flow of funds into rural areas, and on the other hand, it can maintain the continued use of funds in rural areas. The method of fully developing farmers' credit is for farmers to have a sound organization themselves. This organization is the rural cooperative. The cooperative is a legal organization formed by farmers with the spirit of self-help and mutual assistance, with common goals, jointly bearing joint and several liability, and using joint credit to receive the flow of funds from cities. For investors, it can provide sufficient security. Only in this way can it be able to accept investors' funds, otherwise the farmers themselves will have no possibility of receiving them, and the result will still be zero. (3) It is necessary to base on the proper goals of assisting agricultural finance, so that this undertaking will not be in danger of interruption. The goal of assisting rural finance must have a long-term vision, a universal idea of ​​promotion, and its methods must never impose any restrictions or difficulties on farmers, nor can it violate economic principles and give special conditions. (Such as abnormally low interest, etc.) It must be known that assisting agricultural finance is by no means comparable to relief. It must be carried out according to the principles of economic and natural development in order to achieve practical results. As for special conditions, it can only be supported for a time, and cannot be implemented permanently; it can only be implemented in a certain area, and cannot be generally implemented; it can only be implemented by one or two groups, and cannot arouse the joint participation of other institutions or investors. As a result, it will inevitably flow into a deformed state or a false development.</p>
<p>As for how to make the funds produce considerable results after flowing into rural areas. Now that funds have the possibility of flowing into rural areas, and farmers also have the ability to accept financial assistance, the question of what kind of effect it produces is an important question that we cannot ignore. On this issue, first, farmers must pay special attention to the use of funds and must use them for production. It cannot be used for consumption, and especially must prevent improper or nominal use. Otherwise, the flow of funds into rural areas will be harmful and useless, the rural bankruptcy will remain the same, the farmers' suffering and displacement will remain the same, and the agricultural decline will also remain the same. Even worse. As for planning the use, the responsibility also lies in the sound organization of the cooperative. Second, in addition to assisting agricultural finance, it is also necessary to promote farmers' literacy movement or other mass education and agricultural improvement movement, which will be very effective.</p>
<p>We deeply feel that prospering the countryside and rescuing agriculture, assisting farmers in finance is the main plan, and in practice, in order to enable funds to flow into rural areas, the above points must be fully noted. On the farmer side, organizing cooperatives is an essential and unhurried main task, but whether the cooperative can succeed depends on the goals of the promoters and organizers, and the earnest organization. Only in this way can we talk about developing agriculture. The decline of the countryside directly affects the agricultural economy, and indirectly affects the industrial and commercial economy, and the national economy. Recently, the Shanghai Bank has held agricultural cooperative loans. Among commercial banks, it is actually a pioneering initiative to have actually assisted agricultural finance undertakings. Its methods are completely aimed at excellent cooperatives, and it can pay attention to the promotion of cooperative organizations and literacy education movement. The vision is very broad and the methods are extremely appropriate. If it proceeds smoothly in the future, and other banks can also participate together, then our country's rural areas may have a day of prosperity, and the national economy can also develop.</p>
<h3>Banks' Rural Lending</h3>
<p>— France</p>
<p>Upon investigating the origins and development of banking enterprises in European and American countries, it is evident that they are all linked to the development of domestic industry and commerce. In other words, banking is a subsidiary and regulator of industry and commerce, built on the foundation of industry and commerce. Prosperous industry and commerce must come first, and then banking can develop. At the same time, the development of banking can also promote the development of industry and commerce. However, in "semi-colonial China," this has a special function and form.</p>
<p>In the past two decades, China's banking industry has, in a sense, been quite developed. However, its development has not been based on a corresponding and flourishing industry and commerce. If one compares the development of the national banking industry with that of industry and commerce, it is clear that in this respect, banking has surpassed industry and commerce. Consider, what else does China have besides a few silk factories struggling in the wind and some textile factories resembling flickering candles? Light industry is already in such a state; heavy industry is even worse. While other countries are striving for the mechanization and electrification of all production, in China, Mr. Tayler and others are advocating the so-called "small handicraft industry." The pitiful situation is truly heartbreaking.</p>
<p>Similarly, the development of banking has not promoted the development of industry and commerce. China's banking industry can be said to have no original function. Except for a brief period of prosperity in light industry during the European war due to special circumstances, it has been declining year by year recently and cannot reverse the decline due to the development of banking. The reasons for this are complex, but the lack of connection between banking and production is an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>So, on what foundation is China's banking built? It may sound a bit extreme, but China's banking industry is actually just a manifestation of "comprador capital" and "bureaucratic capital."</p>
<p>All productive enterprises cannot develop independently of social relations. The fact that China's banks are groups of comprador capital and bureaucratic capital is determined by the objective social system. China's industry and commerce are unable to develop under the multiple oppressions of imperialism and the remnants of feudal politics. It is not something that banks can fully address. This fact forces banks to "have no connection" with production. On the other hand, the infiltration of imperialist financial capital requires an intermediary, and the economic exploitation by warlords and bureaucrats requires an agent; at the same time, due to the insecurity of investing in productive enterprises, surplus idle capital needs a storage institution. China's banking industry has grown and flourished on this basis. (For example, the official silver shops in the three northeastern provinces and the provincial banks in Shanxi are directly operated by warlords and bureaucrats.) Look at the main businesses of various banks, which are nothing more than "gold business," speculation in public bonds, stocks, and urban real estate mortgages, as well as deposits and remittances.</p>
<p>No matter how you look at it, the main social form in China, apart from the coastal new cities run by international imperialists, is still the countryside. The main productive enterprise is still agriculture. Financial capital is inherently pervasive, and the reason why Chinese banks neglect rural investment is also due to objective social relations. Originally, small-scale farming and household handicrafts were inseparable. Farmers' lives depended half on agricultural income and the other half on the help of household handicrafts. However, since the surplus commodities of capitalism broke through national borders and penetrated into the Chinese countryside, China's inherent handicraft industry has been like fallen leaves in the autumn wind, and farmers' lives have lost a part of their foundation. In addition, the transfer of indemnities, foreign debts, and exorbitant taxes has made the burden on farmers unbearable. Coupled with the constant wars and the widespread banditry and famine they cause, the Chinese countryside has become, as Dr. Hu Shih said, a human hell that even the five ghosts will not enter. In this case, who would be willing to invest in the countryside unless they have the determination to throw money into the sea? In Chinese cities, there is only "talent surplus" and no shortage, but in the countryside, there is indeed a vacuum of talent. In recent years, those who have been shouting "return to agriculture" and "go to the people" are all people living in cities. But no one can be blamed for this, and there are complex social reasons.</p>
<p>However, the foundation on which China's banks are currently based is ultimately building houses on sand. In addition, due to the global economic downturn in recent years and the impact of the general poverty of the people on the reduction of bureaucratic capital, the original foundation of all banks has begun to show signs of shaking. More far-sighted bankers must be anxious to find other ways out. It just so happens that the government is now making special efforts to promote rural cooperation, and the funds for cooperative subsidies under the financial panic have become a problem. This is the best opportunity for banks to try new ways out, that is, to use financial capital to penetrate into the countryside through the medium of cooperatives.</p>
<p>It is reported that Shanghai banks are engaged in rural lending and have donated huge sums of money to Nanjing Jinling University to establish a rural research chair to cultivate rural cooperative talents. This is a new attempt in the banking industry. Let's wait and see its future effects!</p>
<h3>On Rent Deposits</h3>
<p>— Liangming</p>
<p>Since the Qin Dynasty in China, when "small people cultivated the fields of wealthy people and paid taxes of ten out of fifteen," every period has been characterized by "fields not owned by the cultivators, and field owners not cultivating." Today, in most parts of China, the majority of land is cultivated by tenant farmers. The prevalence of the tenancy system is an important reason for the exhaustion of rural finance and the decline of agricultural technology in China.</p>
<p>The current rural production relations, on the one hand, cause the exhaustion of the small-scale peasant economy, and on the other hand, force the majority of poor peasants into the path of death and banditry. The so-called rent deposit is a significant form of exploitation that comes with the prevalence of the tenancy system. It is a tool that promotes the exhaustion of rural finance and the influx of most farmers into the path of death and banditry.</p>
<p>Rent deposits exist in almost all rural areas of China, with the only difference being the names. For example, in Quzhou, Zhejiang, rent deposits are called Tianzu (填租, filling rent); in Xiangtan, Hunan, they are called Jinzhuang (进庄, entering the estate); near Shanghai, they are called Dingshou (顶首, top head); in Pingyang, Zhejiang, they are called Liyin (礼银, courtesy silver); in Guangshan, Henan, they are called Liqian (礼钱, courtesy money); in Dangyang, Hubei, they are called Zhuangqian (庄钱, estate money); in Dangtu, Anhui, they are called Yazhao (押绍, deposit guarantee); in Changde, Hunan, they are called Pijia (批价, approval price); in Gaoluo, Guangdong, they are called Pitou (批头, approval head); in Qianshan, Anhui, they are called Xizhuang (繫莊, tied to the estate); in Hejiang, Sichuan, they are called Wenzuyin (穏租銀, stable rent silver); in Anqing, Anhui, they are called Jijiuaofei (基脚費, foundation fee); and in Jiangyin, Jiangsu, they are called Chengzongyangqian (承種洋錢, contract planting foreign money). The actual amount of the rent deposit varies from place to place, ranging from a minimum of two or three yuan per mu to a maximum of twenty or thirty yuan. For example, in Dangyang, Hubei, the rent deposit is twenty yuan per mu, and in various parts of Hunan, it is twenty-three yuan. In Haimen, there is even a method called "heavy deposit, light rent," where the rent may not be low, but the deposit is as high as thirty or forty yuan.</p>
<p>Theoretically, the reason for the existence of rent deposits is nothing more than a guarantee for landlords to collect rent, in case they fail to collect the rent, they can deduct it from the rent deposit. In reality, this is not the case. Landlords in various places have well-organized organizations, such as the Ya Dian Suo (押佃所, tenant deposit bureau) in Nantong. Tenant farmers will never be willing to leave their land due to rent arrears unless they have no other choice. Moreover, the so-called rent deposit in various places often has its name, but in reality, it is often a kind of "tribute" given to the landlord when leasing. Whether rent is owed or not, it is not returned.</p>
<p>Therefore, the prevalence of rent deposits has its own significance. To put it simply, it is just like other exorbitant taxes and levies, a kind of exorbitant levy imposed on farmers by landlords to increase their own income. What about the farmers? Because the rural economy is collapsing day by day, and the number of self-cultivating farmers is declining, that is, the number of landless farmers is increasing. In order to survive, except for a few who are lucky enough to be employed in urban factories, they have to compete to rent land from landlords and endure illegal exorbitant levies. As a result, rent deposits are becoming increasingly prevalent. For example, in Kunshan, the number of tenants with rent deposits accounted for only 25.5% in 1905, but increased to 61.8% in 1924; in Nantong, it only accounted for 72.9% in 1905, but increased to 88.1% in 1924.</p>
<p>The role and significance of rent deposits are extremely serious. Today, few Chinese farmers have the ability to pay rent deposits. Because they cannot pay the rent deposit, they cannot rent land, and the only paths left for them are death or banditry. On the other hand, even if they can scrape together enough to pay the rent deposit, the working capital for cultivation is completely deprived. In order to obtain agricultural capital, they have no choice but to become lifelong slaves of high-interest loans. Immigrants in the three northeastern provinces often abandon the land they have reclaimed because they cannot sustain their agricultural capital and become bandits. This is the function of rent deposits.</p>
<h3>Agricultural Product Transactions in Chinese Rural Areas</h3>
<p>— Luo Fu</p>
<p>High-interest loan capital has always occupied a dominant position in rural finance in China. However, in the earlier era of a relatively self-sufficient local economy, there were fewer opportunities for high-interest loan capital to be active. But since the Chinese economy joined the world vortex and agricultural products have gradually become commodified, farmers' products and daily necessities need to go through transactions. High-interest loan capital has become even more rampant between buying and selling.</p>
<p>In the agricultural economic era, household handicraft industry and agriculture were originally integrated. Farmers used the harvest of agricultural products as food, and handicraft products as clothing. In this way, the farmer's economy was relatively self-sufficient. However, since imperialist commodities, with their cheap and good quality, invaded the Chinese countryside, they naturally squeezed out the original household handicraft industry. This is not because farmers like the new and dislike the old, but because foreign cloth is superior to native cloth in both quality and price. Therefore, according to various surveys, the self-sufficient economy (relatively speaking) has been completely destroyed. For example, in the Chengdu Plain of Sichuan, almost half of the food consumed by the people is purchased. In Yanshan County, Hebei, only 44% of farmers' food is self-produced. According to Qiao Qiming's survey from 1922 to 1925, the daily necessities purchased by farmers from the market in the surveyed provinces accounted for 24.1%. In northern Manchuria, the daily necessities purchased by farmers account for about 50% or more.</p>
<p>Since farmers have to purchase daily necessities from the market, they must sell their agricultural products to compensate for income and expenditure. In addition, due to the needs of imperialists for raw materials and the fact that planting raw materials is more profitable than planting food, there have been significant changes in the planting of agricultural products in various places in recent years. For example, many rice fields have now been converted into cotton fields, which is a clear example. Therefore, according to surveys, 56% of agricultural products are sold in Yanshan, and other places are also above 50%. In the way agricultural products are bought and sold, high-interest loan capital takes advantage of it, and farmers are subjected to another layer of exploitation.</p>
<p>Most Chinese farmers are small-scale farmers. The exhaustion of small-scale farmer finances makes it impossible for them to exercise their own will in the buying and selling of agricultural products. Mr. Sun Yat-sen also said: Chinese farmers "are eager to borrow money to survive before the rice harvest and when the crops are not yet ripe, or are eager to pay grain and rent after the harvest, so they have to sell rice at extremely low prices. Merchants buy rice at extremely low prices, and with a simple turnover, they resell it at extremely high prices. The money earned in the middle of buying and selling has nothing to do with you farmers." In fact, this situation is already good. Most agricultural product transactions are carried out in the form of pre-sales or pre-mortgages.</p>
<p>Under the pre-sale or pre-mortgage method, farmers have no control over the agricultural products they have obtained with their sweat and blood. For example, in Shaanxi, when farmers lack capital, they borrow money from cotton firms, grain firms, and even landlords and wealthy farmers, mortgaging the agricultural products of the next season. After the harvest, the agricultural products are converted into cash to repay the loan, and the interest is calculated in the market price of the agricultural products. For example, if you borrow 16 yuan, and the price of wheat at that time is 20 yuan per dan, but according to the creditor's calculation, it is based on 16 yuan per dan, and the borrower must return one dan of wheat when it is due, and the creditor will take 4 yuan of profit from it. Furthermore, pre-sales are when farmers need capital, they pre-sell the agricultural products in their fields to wealthy gentlemen, landlords, or merchants. If the market price of wheat is 20 yuan per dan, the pre-sold wheat is only 12 or 13 yuan per dan. Other examples such as Qingmiao Qian (青苗钱, green shoot money) and Ya Gan Zu (押乾租, dry rent mortgage) in Guangdong and other places are all high-interest loan capital exploiting farmers in the form of selling and buying.</p>
<p>The buying and selling methods are by no means so simple. High-interest loan capitalists can also manipulate market prices to exploit farmers in the rise and fall of agricultural product prices. For example, in the Heilongjiang River basin in the three northeastern provinces, "local money houses and transshipment agencies, on the one hand, use the power of the government to forcibly set low prices to buy farmers' soybeans; on the other hand, they set high prices and sell them to bean cake factories. Therefore, according to the estimation of Shishi Shi Liannuofu, after deducting transportation costs, taxes, and other miscellaneous expenses, only one-third of the market price of soybeans goes to the farmers" (see Farmers and Landlords in the Heilongjiang River Basin).</p>
<p>Those who promote high-interest loan exploitation through agricultural product buying and selling are not only wealthy farmers, landlords, and merchants, but also bureaucrats and warlords are often promoters of high-interest loans. For example, in the former three northeastern provinces, official silver houses forcibly bought soybeans from farmers with Feng Piao (奉票, Feng banknotes) on the one hand, and on the other hand, farmers had to pay taxes in cash. It was common for Feng Piao to be discounted, and as a result, farmers' soybeans were nothing more than a kind of tribute.</p>
<p>Moreover, since Chinese agricultural products have joined the world commodity vortex, the buying and selling relationship is also dominated by international capitalists. For example, most of the grain production in the three northeastern provinces is absorbed by Japan, Britain, the United States, Denmark, and other places every year; grain prices completely depend on the international market for transfer and cannot be freely adjusted. Therefore, international capitalists use gold to oppress Chinese commercial capitalists' silver, and silver oppresses Chinese farmers' silver. Even on the surface, a seemingly simple agricultural product transaction can make the fate of Chinese farmers subordinate to the hands of international capitalists.</p>
<h3>Obstacles to Rural Cooperation</h3>
<p>— He</p>
<p>The exhaustion of rural finance in China is gradually deepening and becoming more widespread. Originally, under today's land system, all social conditions are depriving farmers of their capital and driving them into poverty. For example, small farmers need to purchase land capital in order to obtain land for cultivation, and tenant farmers need to pay rent deposits in addition to land rent when renting land, and have to enter the door of high-interest loan capitalists; extremely high taxes and all kinds of exorbitant levies make small farmers subordinate to high-interest loan capitalists; disasters and poor harvests, and soldiers, bandits, and thieves, make small farmers subordinate to high-interest loan capitalists; even weddings, funerals, celebrations, and price changes are opportunities for high-interest loan capitalists. Therefore, as the farmers in Suiyuan, "family property, agricultural tools, livestock, and food are all destroyed by bandits. Even if they have land, they cannot cultivate it, and they cannot bear to sit and watch the fields being barren. They have no choice but to flock to local bullies, rascals, bureaucrats, unscrupulous gentry, and commercial capitalists under high-interest loans in order to survive. These lenders all exploit heavy interest and are cruel and ruthless." 28% of the farmers in Mount Emei, Sichuan, rely on high-interest loans to survive. The percentage of farmers indebted to the total number of farmer households in the eight counties of Jinhua and Lanxi, Zhejiang, is 58.8%. In Nantong, Kunshan, and other places, "very few tenants' capital is completely owned by themselves. Most of them borrow other people's capital to make up for the shortfall. The Kunshan and Suxian tenants all borrow from landlords; while in Nantong, they mostly borrow from the rich. The tenants in Kunshan who borrow from the landlords account for about 66.4%, and Suxian accounts for 41.1%." Most farmers in other places are also indebted (see Feng Hefa's "Outline of Rural Sociology," also known as "Research on Chinese Rural Society," published by Liming Bookstore).</p>
<p>American gentleman-style "philanthropists" who study Chinese rural problems often blame Chinese farmers' poverty on "gluttony, laziness, and aversion to work." In fact, Chinese farmers try their best to make a living, and as long as they can survive, they really take every opportunity. For example, the farmers in North China, "except in prosperous years, everyone always eats according to their appetite, and even in the cold winter, there is a so-called winter dormancy habit, and everyone does not go to work, which further reduces food. The standard of living in East China is slightly higher, but most farmers are also in a state of hunger and cold" (see Tayler: The Study of Chinese Rural Economy). Furthermore, the "farmers' meals in Jian Mountain often change according to the climate. ... During the winter, most farmers do not work, so farmers reduce to two meals a day to save money, and their food is also the most economical. They usually use wild yellow rapeseed in the alkaline beach as part of their food, but yellow rapeseed can often cause diarrhea, which is not hygienic. ... In summer, the green leaves of yellow rapeseed can also be used as a side dish. ... According to the investigators' estimates, each family consumes an average of two dan of yellow rapeseed and about 500 catties of yellow rapeseed leaves per year" (Bu Kai's survey, see Outline of Rural Sociology).</p>
<p>The ills of farmer poverty are not limited to themselves, but also affect all aspects of society, involving a wide range of issues. The causes of poverty are multifaceted, and the rescue problem is naturally very complex.</p>
<p>On the one hand, in order to rescue the exhaustion of rural finance, and on the other hand, to counter the Communist Party's economic policies that confuse farmers, rural cooperation is indeed a good way. However, cooperativism is a revolutionary doctrine, with its entire system and goals, and cannot be split up. For example, according to the ideal of cooperativism, its organization is a bottom-up, small-to-large people's automatic movement, because only in this way can the members of the cooperative become "masters of their own" and achieve the ideal state. But in China, rural cooperatives are just a kind of top-down "charitable government relief enterprise," which "seems" to be inconsistent with real cooperation.</p>
<p>It is said that the consumer cooperative of the Central Political School of Nanjing is the most perfect and successful cooperative in China. But at the same time, it is said that the reason why the society can have such achievements is because it has a monthly subsidy of several thousand yuan. If so, then the achievements of the society cannot be denied, but as for whether it is suitable for the principles of real cooperation, the 1844 Rochdale cooperative pioneers in the underground may sigh.</p>
<p>The existence and development of cooperatives cannot transcend the social relations of the time; strictly speaking, under the current rural situation in China, regardless of the education situation, the economic situation also makes it difficult for "real" rural cooperatives to develop. Today's top-down cooperatives only give wealthy farmers and even high-interest lenders more opportunities. It is difficult for farmers who are truly poor and have no collateral to take the lead in cooperatives (referring to credit cooperatives). Even if they do, on the one hand, they receive the help of the cooperative, and on the other hand, they are still exploited by merchants, landlords, and high-interest lenders, which is still useless. According to the cooperative's report, farmers borrow money from the cooperative not for production purposes, but mostly for debt repayment, which is this phenomenon.</p>
<p>Therefore, the current problem is: how to popularize cooperatives in order to rescue the countryside! In order for cooperatives to play a proper role, how to first eliminate the obstacles to cooperatives! That is, the various factors that cause rural poverty! What kind of cooperative is in line with cooperative principles and can lead to the ideal society of cooperators? This is the "urgent task" that loyal fellow comrades should strive for now!</p>
<p>Otherwise, the rural cooperative is just an empty name. Under the same name, the nature can be completely different. It can be an economic organization for farmers to defend themselves, but at the same time, it can also be a tool for financial capitalists and even high-interest lenders to monopolize agricultural product sales and control financial circulation.</p>
<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Financial Sunday</h3>
<p>Silver Dollar Market Particularly Quiet</p>
<p>Guangjiao Has Export News</p>
<p>Yesterday, Sunday, the financial industry was more lackluster than usual. Banks were closed, and money shops lacked large amounts of lending. In addition, there was little new news on Sunday to report. Yesterday, the overnight interest rate for silver dollars was 4%, an improvement of 2% from the previous day, but the trading of overnight bills was extremely scarce. The morning market of silver funds was only over 1.2 million, and the total in the afternoon market and small general meeting was only over 1.1 million. The total amount of silver fund transactions in the morning, afternoon, and small general meeting was only over 3.3 to 4 million. The morning market for remittance bills was 80,000, and the afternoon market was 380,000. Money shops received 500,000 to 700,000 in silver dollar public notes, and 15 to 16 million in silver public notes. Remittances from various sources were 200,000 to 300,000, and transactions in small money shops were over 400,000. Guangdong small silver dollars are currently flooding the market, causing prices to fall daily, and exchange rates are becoming increasingly long. Recently, each silver dollar can be exchanged for 12 jiao plus 100 wen. According to the market price, this is already 12 jiao 45 fen, and it is still falling. In general, hoarding entities are forced to find a way out, and shipping to other ports has been approved by the customs, and exports are now allowed. Therefore, the market price yesterday felt more attractive. The morning market was 5 qian 7 fen 5 li 7 hao 5 si, an increase of 1 li 2 hao 5 si from the previous day's afternoon market. The afternoon market was still lower by 1 li, at 5 qian 7 fen 4 li 8 hao 7 si 5 hu. The morning market traded 65,000 jiao, and the afternoon market traded 25,000 jiao. The morning and afternoon markets for Jiangnan small silver dollars were both 6 qian 1 fen 6 li, and only 5,000 jiao were traded in the morning market. Copper coins rose suddenly by 2,000 wen, to 426,500 wen.</p>

<h3>Securities: Public Bonds Initially Weak, Then Recovered Last Week</h3>
<p>Tuesday: Tianjin Rumors Rampant, Plunging by Over Two Yuan</p>
<p>Thursday and Saturday: Bulls and Bears Fighting, Rebounding</p>
<p>Last week, from March 20th to 25th, the bond market of the China Merchants Securities Exchange, although it was the last week of the March futures, the struggle was not very large. In reality, although the short squeeze was significant, there were also many bulls coming out. For example, the exits of the short positions in Nos. 32, 38, and 47 were relatively easy, and the market price was mostly stable. The market was clearest on Monday, slightly weaker by a few jiao. On Tuesday, Tianjin rumors suddenly spread, and the market was shocked for a while. The morning market plunged by about two yuan, and the afternoon market stabilized slightly. On Wednesday, the Tianjin rumors subsided, and the market price rose sharply in reaction, rebounding by more than one yuan in unison. The three days from Thursday to Saturday were entirely a period of mutual infighting between the bulls and bears. Bulls, such as Nos. 32, 38, and 47, gradually came out one after another, and the short positions were also strongly covered, but their hidden strength was still stronger among the bulls. Therefore, the daily results were all slightly higher by a few jiao. Overall, the results of the week were mostly slightly higher than the previous week by a few jiao, so most fell by a few jiao to one yuan and a few jiao. The total turnover was 47,511,000 yuan, including 11,000 yuan in cash and 47,500,000 yuan in futures. According to March's transactions, there is only one day left today.</p>
<h3>Yarn Flower Fine Cotton Supplementing Empty Spaces Continues Firm</h3>
<p>English Indian Cotton Turns Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market was quiet and firm, with a lack of sellers. Spot merchants bought in, and short positions covered. Futures rose by one to three points. Spot prices fell by five points. English cotton futures fell by one point, and spot prices fell by three points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by four points. Indian cotton long and short positions settled, and the market was stable. Pingguoer fell by 0.25 rupees, Aomula fell by 1.75 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell by 1.25 rupees.

<h3>Grain River Down Rice Continues to Fall by Two Dimes</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, more than sixty sources arrived. Retail appetite was poor due to continuous rain, and with the influx of sources, everyone adopted a wait-and-see attitude. The market gradually weakened. Sutong bang and Nangang Qingjiao, etc., fell by two dimes. Doyangjian and Yinyuan were also sluggish, and were also affected by [lower-priced] rice, so the price continued to fall by one or two dimes.</p>

Aside from small-sized Bujian, village-sized Yangjian showed some weakness. Yinyuan and Bianyuan also appeared soft.</p>

<h3>Silk and Tea  Raw Silk Sales Decline Significantly</h3>
<p>New York Silk Inventory Remains High</p>
<p>Spring silk fabric sales are disappointing. Silk factories in New York are now focusing on summer thin silk products. The raw material for thin silk mainly relies on rayon. Since the silver crisis occurred, the world economy has been unstable. The silk industry, seeing the sluggish sales of silk fabrics, is advocating a policy of reducing production. Raw silk sales have declined significantly. Moreover, the import of Japanese silk this month has not weakened. New York's current silk inventory remains high. The total inventory of raw silk from China, Japan, Italy, and France in the city's warehouses has reached 53,307 bales, with Japanese silk accounting for 87%. This is sufficient to meet the needs of factories for one and a half months.</p>
<p>Customs Warehouse Silk Overflowing</p>
<h3>Rayon Imports Drop Sharply</h3>
<p>Foreign firms in this port selling European and American rayon are unable to pay import taxes, so they are storing the rayon shipped to Shanghai by various postal ships in customs warehouses. They will pay taxes and pick up the goods after selling some. As a result, customs warehouses are overflowing with silk, and imports have dropped sharply. Last Saturday, only 104 boxes of British rayon arrived on the British postal ship Puteng, and are still stored in customs warehouses for sale.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods  Medium-Grade Black Melon Seeds Turn Loose</h3>
<p>Recently, high-grade black melon seeds have been out of stock. Market prices have not changed. Jikui seeds require about 17 taels. However, there are more medium-grade goods in stock, and the market has loosened. Yesterday, the Minbang handled Dangshan seeds for 13.5 taels, and Xukui seeds for 13 taels. The price gradually decreases to around 12 to 11 taels. The high and low grades are stable, while the medium grade has loosened and is not expected to rise or fall for the time being.</p>
<h3>Oil Market Asphalt and Hans Electricity Rise Continuously</h3>
<p>The asphalt market has been like a waterfall for a month, unstoppable. Until the day before yesterday, Hans Electricity said that Macheng oil had risen by 4 qian, totaling 14.8 taels. It still needs to be watched closely. The market, which was declining daily, has finally found a mainstay, and we cannot but recognize the signs of a turnaround. Moreover, now is the time when candles are being trimmed and summer crops need it. The silent situation has now been broken, and the psychology of those involved has been stirred up. The market now has a booming atmosphere. According to last night's Hans Electricity report, Macheng oil added another 8 qian, totaling 15.6 taels. Then another telegram said that it should be watched immediately at 16 taels. However, there was no mention of Chongping Jing oil. Presumably, there is not much spot available, and it is not easy to open a price for a while. It is estimated that it must also rise by about 2 taels. The selling price of the local merchants today may need to be increased, otherwise, there will be no concessions on the original price of 26.4 yuan per load for Ming Chongjing, 26.2 yuan for miscellaneous brands, 25.4 yuan for Pingjing, and 23.8 yuan for Macheng oil.</p>
<h3>Hardware  Hankou Gang Massively Purchases Galvanized Iron Sheet</h3>
<p>Lead Wire Also Has Activity</p>
<p>The hardware trade has recently seen unusual activity from the Hankou gang. Items such as Huayuan lead wire and galvanized iron sheets are being purchased on a large scale. As many as three or four thousand loads of Huayuan lead wire and new lead wire have been shipped out, and the demand for galvanized iron sheet is even greater, causing the inventory in Shanghai to be almost completely purchased. Standard prices are rising steadily. The current price for No. 2 can be as high as 28.5 taels, No. 3 is 23.5 taels, No. 4 is 23.75 taels, No. 5 is 24 taels, No. 6 is 22.5 taels, and Nos. 7 to 10 are all 23.5 taels. Thick colored is 24 taels, which is 2.5 qian to 1 tael higher than the previous market.</p>
<h3>Coal  Bituminous Coal Lump Price Slightly Better</h3>
<p>Recently, there has not been much spot coal from Kaiping blocks, and the overall market is looking good. Yesterday, the price was raised by 2.5 qian per ton. Boshan block coal, where Luku customers are buying, also saw prices rise by 2 or 3 qian. However, the sales of coal dust are sluggish. Small Shan goods have fallen by about 1 qian per ton. Yesterday, Hangbang bought 100 tons of Datong original blocks, and the price rose by another 1 qian.</p>

<h3>Will Have a Trip to London</h3>

<p>Russian Newspaper Criticizes</p>
<h3>British Capitalism</h3>
<p>Havas Moscow, 26th - Recently, British newspapers, due to the Soviet Union's arrest of six British engineers, have called on the British government to sever trade relations with the Soviet Union, and even diplomatic relations. Recently, the Soviet government's official newspaper, "Izvestia," attacked the British newspapers' remarks, calling them capitalist newspapers. The newspaper said, "It is very possible that foreign engineers working in Russia may include saboteurs." It also said, "Although the Soviet Union can provide preferential working conditions for foreign engineers, the Soviet government has never given up its right to supervise them." The newspaper also said that the British argument, taking the arrested engineers as just British officials, concludes that they could not be saboteurs. This kind of dogmatic theory is ridiculous. The newspaper said, "If British newspapers think they can intimidate the Soviet Union with strong words, then the British press does not understand the history of the Soviet Union. If Britain and Russia really sever trade relations, only Britain will suffer." "Izvestia" suspects that this is a movement on the British side to influence the trend of the United States recognizing the Soviet Union. The Communist Party's official newspaper, "Pravda," said, "Although the arrested British engineers have confessed and evidence has been obtained, the British Conservative Party is still doing everything possible to prevent the defendants from being tried by the Soviet Union, fearing that the crimes will be announced and known to the world." The newspaper recalled the shooting incident by the British in Baku in 1918 and attacked the attitude of imperialist countries that consider themselves civilized.</p>

<h3>Diplomatic Strategies After Leaving the League</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Japan's diplomatic policy after leaving the League of Nations will be based on the three major principles of autonomy, impartiality, and unyielding, improving international relations with the United States, Russia, and China, with the goal of promoting and maintaining peace in the Far East and eliminating hostile feelings between each other. This is the most important thing. At the same time, it will seek to strengthen Japan's economic diplomacy and enhance Japan's independent position. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>To provide full assistance to "Manchukuo" to promote its sound development, to cooperate with each other to stabilize Far Eastern policy, and to improve mutual trade relations, and strive to control Japanese-Manchu economic rights.</p>
<p>With regard to China, hoping to reach a period when the three countries of China, Japan, and "Manchukuo" cooperate to ensure the safety of the Far East and establish friendly relations, temporarily observe the internal political movements in China. Japan does not automatically engage in negotiations and other active activities. Even if China still uses the strategy of using barbarians to control barbarians and falls into errors, it will only kindly urge it to reflect. However, it still expects the Chinese government to automatically improve the protection of relations between China and "Manchukuo" and to create the beginning of diplomatic relations between the three countries of China, Japan, and "Manchukuo."</p>
<p>The policy toward the United States will eliminate the feelings of jealousy toward Japan in the United States cultivated by the Stimson Doctrine, recognize Japan's active position in the Far East, carry out local understandings between the two countries for the peace of the Far East and the Pacific, and promote economic exchange. Regarding disarmament and other non-war facilities, we must strive to recognize the special circumstances between each other and achieve benevolent cooperation.</p>
<p>Regarding diplomacy with Russia, although it is considered that the time has not yet come for a non-aggression treaty between Japan and Russia, we respect the economic cooperation between the two countries, formalize the relationship between Russia and "Manchukuo," and eliminate the anxiety of the border area in northern Manchuria, so as to thoroughly implement a friendly policy with the qualifications of a good neighbor.</p>
<p>With regard to British policy, we respect Britain's special interests in the Orient, and at the same time make them understand Japan's belief in "Manchukuo," and maintain the friendly relations since the Anglo-Japanese alliance.</p>
<p>The policy toward France is the same as that toward Britain, to support the recognition of Japan's active position in the Far East.</p>
<p>With regard to the League of Nations and other European small countries, we only express passive dissatisfaction with European political issues, but still cooperate with disarmament, other peaceful undertakings, and cultural undertakings. For South America and the South Pacific, we increase or change the consuls general and consuls, with the aim of expanding economic relations and transportation, mutual cultural development, etc.</p>

<h3>Germany and Japan Clash</h3>
<p>Japan Adopts a Double-Edged Policy</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Hitler Fascist government is carrying out various methods in an attempt to regain control of the South Pacific Islands. Japan, fearing that its plan will be realized, is proposing military equality and the import of military supplies to Germany as exchange conditions on the one hand, to please Germany. On the other hand, it is suggesting to France to cooperate to stop the German revival as a condition, instigating France to stop the German government from regaining control of the South Pacific Islands. Whether the double-edged policy of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs can achieve its goal remains to be seen. (27th China Allied Telegram)</p>

<p>The Erna dispute is temporarily shelved. (Weirna is a territory contested by Poland and Lithuania.) First, seek a way to unite yourselves. As for the two countries of Latvia and Estonia, they are friendly with Poland. We cannot ask the two countries to abandon Poland and follow Lithuania. If the countries along the Baltic Sea can compromise with each other to seek unity, they will certainly become an important force in international politics. The Weirna dispute will also easily find a compromise that Lithuania can accept." Mr. Hitnas concluded, "Lithuania is indeed reluctant to part with the Weirna area, but we should know that Lithuania's territory is certainly not limited to this. In addition to Weirna, there is other land, and its independence and invulnerability to covetousness are equally important," and so on.</p>

Several German business representatives here have resigned from the company as a protest against the German mistreatment of Jewish people.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 26th. Representatives of the Board of Deputies of British Jews held a secret three-hour meeting today and decided not to endorse a boycott of German goods in the name of the organization. They also resolved to take possible steps to request that those in charge acknowledge the view that Jewish people in Germany should be granted freedom and fairness. A public meeting is planned to be held in London as soon as possible. The chairman of the group, Lieski, stated at the meeting that he personally supported the boycott of German goods.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 26th. The U.S. State Department is now carefully trying to avoid misunderstandings about the resentment of Jewish people in the U.S. over Germany's mistreatment of Jewish people. All information transmitted by the U.S. Embassy and Consulates in Germany is now not being released, pending the acquisition of complete records. The United States wishes to be beneficial to people and pays close attention to human welfare; this is the attitude of the United States.</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, 26th. After sending people to Germany for a formal investigation of the German Nazi Party's abuse of Jewish people, the State Department stated, "In a short period of time, German Jewish people did suffer abuse, but at present, this matter can be considered to be almost over," and so on.</p>

<p>Japanese Participate in Raising Anti-Japanese慰勞金</p>
<p>The Tokyo Jiji Shinpo reported on the 21st that part of the Yokosuka Naval District in Nagai Town, Miura County, Kanagawa Prefecture, was suddenly discovered to have been secretly sold to a certain foreigner. One piece of land, more than 2.3 mu, was located on the Nagahama coast, and another piece of land, several hundred mu, was located on the Tsubakidomari coast. Both were common property of the village. However, this land is close to the Arasaki Fort and is a vital area. Unexpectedly, the traitor Kamo Kohei colluded with a certain foreign intelligence agency and was about to sell it for 50,000 yuan, extracting a commission of 13,000 yuan. The matter was discovered by the authorities, and Kamo was arrested.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun reported on the 21st that after the Metropolitan Police Department arrested 17 students for raising anti-Japanese慰勞金 for Chinese students, a thorough investigation revealed that one Japanese person participated. The criminal was named Yoshida Jin, residing in Hiroo Town, Azabu Ward, and was an important employee of the "Keizai Shinbun." He also printed other anti-Japanese and destabilizing documents and distributed them to members and the Chinese army.</p>

<h3>Oppose Postage Increase</h3>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 27th. The proposal by the Chinese postal authorities to increase the postal rate to one dime and two and a half cents has aroused serious protests from overseas Chinese. The Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce has now entrusted the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to telegraph the Ministry of Communications in Nanjing, requesting that this proposal not be implemented for the time being, saying that during the national crisis, overseas Chinese are donating money to save the country, and the government's sudden action is unwise. The Chinese government should vigorously encourage overseas Chinese to remit as much money as possible back to the country. If the fees for remittance packages are increased, it will prevent the flow of money into China and hinder the government's income.</p>

<h3>No Ambition to Covet Portuguese Territories</h3>
<p>The People of Portugal are Greatly Reassured</p>
<p>Reuters, Lisbon, 26th. The Portuguese government today received news from Rome that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini declared that he had never expressed any ambition to occupy Portuguese territories in Africa, such as Angola. The Portuguese government's efforts and progress in colonial affairs are admired by the world. He will certainly treat Portugal with the best of friendship.</p>
<p>Havas, Portuguese Capital, 26th. After rumors spread that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini advocated the partition of Portuguese colonies, the government issued an official statement yesterday to deny it, and the people of Portugal were reassured. Most newspapers only reprinted the text of the government communiqué without adding any detailed discussion. However, the "Daily News" stated, "Portuguese colonies cannot be the trading goods of false peacemakers, nor can they be touched by others." The Portuguese overseas territories are roughly as follows: (1) In Africa: Cape Verde Islands, São Tomé and Príncipe Islands, Portuguese East Africa, Portuguese Guinea, Portuguese West Africa Angola, with a total area of 793,980 square miles. (2) In India: Goa, Daman, Diu, with an area of 1,638 square miles (3) In China: Macau Concession, (4) In Oceania: East Timor Islands, with an area of 7,330 square miles.</p>

<h3>British View of Japan's Collapse</h3>
<p>Translated by Mencius Guide Newspaper Report</p>
<p>Since Japan abandoned the gold standard in December 1931, the Japanese yen has fallen sharply in value. The legal parity of the Japanese yen is 49 US cents, but the current exchange rate is only about 20 cents, a drop of 60% from parity. In September 1931, Japan's finances were in relatively good condition, but the military expenditures increased by the Manchurian Incident and the subsidies for disaster relief caused the budget to fail to balance. As of the end of June last year, the deficit reached 59.5 million Japanese yen. In addition to directly raising public bonds, the government also used the postal savings under the custody of the savings bureau to raise funds indirectly. Between July and September, the number of domestic government bond tickets increased by 8 million Japanese yen, and treasury bonds increased by 58 million Japanese yen. From the end of September 1931 to August 1932, the government's internal debt increased by more than 460 million Japanese yen. However, in September last year, there was a temporary decline. The government also misappropriated most of the postal savings increase from the savings bureau, which amounted to more than 300 million Japanese yen from September 1931 to July 1932. However, by June of last year, this amount was insufficient. The government issued treasury bonds in June, or perhaps in July, to implement an indirect expansion policy. These bonds were underwritten by the Bank of Japan and the Savings Bureau. Now the government has been forced to use the bank loan method to implement a direct expansion policy. The amount of postal savings used to increase continuously. In June 1931, it was 254.7 million Japanese yen. By July 1932, it had increased to 290.2 million. Now it is decreasing due to the low interest rate. One of the purposes of lowering the interest rate may be to encourage people to subscribe for the issued bonds. However, at the same time, the deposits in ordinary savings banks, which had decreased from June 1931 to June 1932, began to increase again. If the deposits continue to transfer from the post office to private banks, the government may fall into deep poverty. In any case, with this source of funds gradually drying up, the Bank of Japan will inevitably be directly affected by the government.</p>
<p>Huge Military Expenditures Will Inevitably Lead to Inflation</p>
<p>The fact of inflation is recognized as true by both the government and the press. The real reason for this is the huge military expenditures. However, there are not a few people who come out to defend this opinion based on economics and sociology. Therefore, the policy of inflationists has received strong public support. The goal is to implement a controlled inflation policy and take France's example from 1923 to 1928 as a model to emulate. The government seems to be convinced that when the crisis passes in the future, it will be able to limit the period of inflation and prevent the rise and fall of the market price of the Japanese yen, thereby preventing irreparable damage. The proposed control measures are as follows:</p>
<p>1. The budget must be balanced by increasing taxes and tightening expenditures.</p>
<p>2. The difference in foreign expenditures must be corrected by increasing current and invisible exports and reducing imports.</p>
<p>However, Japan's situation is much weaker than France's in the past. Therefore, in reality, it is a question of whether Japan can learn from France or Germany. France is a rich country with abundant natural resources and many sources of wealth. Therefore, it can almost be self-sufficient. Japan is an extremely poor country with very few natural resources. The only austerity policy to save the Japanese budget is to curb military spending, which exceeds half of the country's annual expenditure. The estimated expenditure for 1933 to 1934 is 2235 million Japanese yen, of which 662 million Japanese yen is for naval expenses, and 472 million Japanese yen is for naval expenses. The estimated revenue is only 133 million Japanese yen, with a shortfall of 99 million. In addition to this shortfall, several repayments must be added, and it is estimated that new public bonds of about 100 million Japanese yen (approximately 61 million pounds) will need to be issued. To raise this amount, it is planned to recruit as much as possible from the people, and the Bank of Japan will pay the balance. This whole amount is of course very large, because the Savings Bureau has been borrowed empty by the government, and the commercial banks are not very stable, so the Bank of Japan has to bear it alone. As for how far taxes can be increased, it depends on the people's ability to pay taxes. The number is probably not much.</p>
<p>It's really come to the end of the road. Then, stopping the payment of foreign debt may get some relief. However, Japan has not stopped paying it. Japan's foreign debt was estimated at 219.5 million Japanese yen on June 30, 1932. Almost all of it has to be converted at foreign currency rates, and interest must also be paid accordingly. The annual interest payable has been estimated at US$26,225,672, £3,776,259, 20,454,966 francs, and 254,066 Japanese yen. Calculated according to the November exchange rate, the total annual interest payment reaches 240,791,000 Japanese yen, which is about twice the legal parity. This is a serious injury to the budget, and the exchange rate of the Japanese yen should be expected to fall further. Now it is already trending down due to the expected inflation to be more severe. The more the Japanese yen depreciates, the more the interest on foreign debt will increase when converted into Japanese yen.</p>
<p>Imports and Exports</p>
<p>The policy of increasing exports and reducing imports is more difficult in Japan than in most other countries. Among Japan's imports, the raw materials necessary for industry are between 55% and 60% of the total value. These are things that Japan has very little of. The most important raw materials are cotton (accounting for 25% of total imports), wool (accounting for 5%), oil cake, wood, coal, and ammonium sulfate. Equally important food (meat, wheat, rice, beans, and sugar) accounts for about 13% of the total value of imports, while finished and semi-finished goods each account for about 15%. Machinery and vehicles, including mineral oil, account for almost half of the value of finished goods (7% of the total value of imports). Semi-finished goods include pulp, ore, pig iron, and ordinary metals. Luxury goods and machine-made goods, which can be dispensed with or can be manufactured in Japan, are imported very little. Therefore, it is very difficult to reduce the amount of imports.</p>
<p>On the other hand, about 90% of Japan's exports are finished and semi-finished goods. Raw silk is counted as a semi-finished product and accounts for about one-third of exports. The main finished products exported are cotton textiles and silk textiles. These two items accounted for one-quarter of total exports in 1931. Silk fabrics and other fabrics together accounted for more than two-thirds of total exports. To increase exports, no matter how hard you try, under the current circumstances, it is necessary to develop industry. This has already been implemented. The depreciation of the Japanese yen can further help to divide the export market. It seems that it can also help to make up for the shortfall. However, because of the development of industry, the amount of raw materials related to manufacturing industry will inevitably increase. In fact, the increase in Japan's imports this year, calculated in Japanese yen, is already more than exports. This is partly due to the fact that the goods of imported goods must be converted into foreign currencies for payment. However, it is not entirely due to this, because the import volume of raw cotton was 377,000 metric tons in the first half of 1931 (one metric ton is 1,000 kilograms, equivalent to 20 dan in the Chinese system), and increased to 560,100 metric tons in the corresponding period of 1932.

<p>Guangdong Army in Jiangxi</p>
<h3>Second Phase of Bandit Suppression Plan</h3>
<p>Implementation Can Be Announced Soon</p>
<p>The Military Headquarters Will Also Move North</p>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: The Communist bandits in Jiangxi Province yesterday had about 500 to 600 people who fled from Huichang to Chongshiwei, Baishiwei, and other places in the northeastern area of Anyuan, and carried out large-scale harassment. The defense army, the Fourth Division of Zhang Meixin, immediately dispatched the Tenth Regiment of Kong Kequan to intercept them. The bandits were eventually repelled, and many bandits were killed. The remaining bandits fled back to Huichang. Zhang Shifu sent the First Battalion of Jiang Wu's Teaching Regiment to search and suppress the remaining bandits in the Hanfang Yueling area. Recently, they have returned to Xinfeng for centralized replenishment. The division took the view that the various bandit suppression armies have launched a large-scale encirclement of the bandits, and the Guangdong army in Jiangxi will also go north to encircle and suppress the bandits at the same time. The division's deputy commander, Wu Jianxiong, was specially dispatched to return to the province from the defense area yesterday to visit the Third Army Commander Xiang Hanping for instructions. As for the main force of the Guangdong army in southern Jiangxi, Yu Hanmou's troops, the second phase of the bandit suppression plan in southern Jiangxi is about to be implemented, and the Guangdong army in various parts of southern Jiangxi will begin to mobilize soon. For the convenience of command, it is planned to advance the headquarters of the First Army to 口口 or 口口 to establish it. Everything is now being prepared in accordance with the order of Commander Yu, and it will be implemented as soon as Commander Yu returns to the defense area. As for the 口口 troops of the 第口师 of the First Army, who are stationed in Nankang, they are also preparing to advance to 口口. The military supplies of various troops should be prepared urgently, and the food 項 must be collected in advance to facilitate progress. The division specially ordered the 后方办务处 of the 第口师駐省 to rush to handle a large number of military supplies and transport them to the front for replenishment, and the师长 口口 has also returned to Nankang to wait for orders to lead the troops to advance. From this, it can be seen that the Guangdong army in southern Jiangxi will go north to suppress the bandits in the near future. In the future, when the First Army advances northward to 口口, the defense areas of 口口 口口 will be taken over by the 口口 部 troops. (March 17)</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Rectifies Land Tax</h3>
<p>Land Tax Revenue Increased Sharply Last Year</p>
<p>Nanchang Communication: Cultivated land in Jiangxi accounts for about one-fifth of the province's area, and farmers account for more than 80%. The local regular tax, excluding temporary donations such as production and sales taxes and salt surcharges, has an annual revenue of 10 million yuan, of which the actual collection of land tax is 5.6 million yuan (the budget is 8 million), accounting for more than half of the total revenue. However, the expenses of various counties for bandit suppression, road construction, education, construction, etc., are all added to the land tax. A tan of rice is taxed at more than 40 yuan, which is more than ten times the regular tax. Therefore, the burden on Jiangxi farmers is extremely heavy. In addition, natural and man-made disasters have been coming one after another in recent years. Imported foreign rice and the price of grain have fallen sharply, leading to the complete bankruptcy of rural areas. In order to reduce the burden on farmers, it is only possible to start with rectifying the land tax and limiting the miscellaneous taxes added by various counties. Jiangxi Province, in addition to fundamentally surveying the land, the immediate measures for rectifying the land tax are to issue notices to various counties that the surcharge should not exceed the regular tax, to check grain strings, and to stipulate the fees for household registration, in order to enrich the national tax and eliminate the people's difficulties. The following is a record of what the Finance Department has announced that has already been implemented for the rectification of land tax.</p>
<h3>Verify and Determine Assessment</h3>
<p>The department has previously formulated a monthly comparison table for the collection of land tax in 68 counties including Nanchang, and formulated the regulations for rewards and punishments for the collection of household rice in various counties, and notified them to follow them. At the end of December last year, the assessment period had arrived. Therefore, for the 54 counties including Nanchang that have sent the comparison table to the department, the assessment will be conducted according to the regulations, and the rewards and punishments will be filled out in a summary table, which will be presented to the provincial government for approval in sequence. The counties that have not yet sent them have been telegraphed strictly to urge them. Once they are sent, they will be handled in a summary case and presented to the government for verification.</p>
<h3>Strictly Order to Check Grain Strings</h3>
<p>Grain strings are the vouchers for collection. It was previously ordered that the county magistrate should thoroughly check them when he takes office, but most of them are regarded as mere formalities, so that unscrupulous clerks can take the opportunity to engage in fraud, encroaching on provincial taxes. The previous order has been reiterated, and a deadline has been set for a thorough check. If any shortfall is found, the clerk in charge will be immediately dismissed and severely prosecuted and reported for investigation.</p>
<h3>Set a Deadline for Completing the Undertakings</h3>
<p>The undertaking of each county has previously been drafted with procedures for proceeding and a deadline for completion. It is now reported that 21 counties have completed the first phase of work to be done, 10 counties are in progress, and the rest have requested an extension of the deadline due to fundraising or unresolved banditry. This department has now decided that no matter what difficulties there are, all of them must be completed and reported before the end of April.</p>
<h3>Issue a Model Form</h3>
<p>The model form of the household rice string previously issued by this department did not include an easy-to-understand form, which was not perfect. The form has now been revised and distributed to various counties, ordering that a model form be added to the string ticket from the beginning of this year, so that grain households can clearly understand the amount of grain they should pay and prepare accordingly in advance, so as not to be deceived by the clerks.</p>
<h3>Stipulate Household Rice Fees</h3>
<p>This province stipulated in the third year of the Republic that the fee for household rice is seven cents per tael of rice and six cents per shi of rice, which is used to pay for the salaries of household clerks and for compiling string ticket books. However, household clerks often use the excuse that prices are high and that they cannot make ends meet, resulting in floating receipts and tail-rolling and extra demands. After a new stipulation, from the beginning of this year, an additional three cents of fee will be charged for each tael of rice, and four cents will be charged for each shi of rice, that is, one dime each for each tael of rice and each shi of rice. If the household clerks engage in floating receipts or extortion again in the future, they will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Comparison of Land Tax for Three Years</h3>
<p>In the 19th year, the amount of land tax collected was 2,389,096 yuan, one dime and nine cents. In the 20th year, it was 2,983,452 yuan, seven dimes and seven cents. In the 21st year, it was 4,686,213 yuan, two dimes and three cents, of which book evidence offset and collections from various years accounted for about one-third of the strength. (March 21)</p>

<p>New Municipal Council Members</p>
<h3>Election Voting Begins This Morning</h3>
<p>Results to be Announced Tomorrow at 7:00 PM</p>
<p>Inauguration Set for the 19th of Next Month</p>
<p>The election of new members to the Public Concession Municipal Council commenced at 9:00 AM this morning at the Municipal Council and Hongkou Police Station.

This year, there are two American and two Japanese candidates, which should not be a problem. As for the British candidates, based on the situation, Macnaghten, Bell, Ansell, Brown, and Massey are the most promising. It is expected that Macnaghten will be the Chairman.</p>
<p>Last Year</p>
<h3>Sino-German Trade Statistics</h3>
<p>A Surplus of Over 70 Million Yuan</p>
<p>According to the Hua Dong News Agency, Sino-German trade statistics for last year have now been compiled by the International Trade Bureau. Chinese goods exported to Germany amounted to 133 million gold marks, while German goods imported into China amounted to 63 million gold marks. Chinese goods exported to Germany exceeded German imports by 69 million gold marks. Calculated at the current gold price, China gained more than 70 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Exports to Russia Are Undeveloped</h3>
<p>Imports of Russian Goods are Very Active</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, since the resumption of Sino-Russian relations, the people of the country have eagerly hoped for the development of commercial relations between the two countries. Because domestic goods are insufficient, people are happy to purchase Russian goods for daily use, which has made Russian exports to China very active. Moreover, because Chinese merchants have urgent needs, they often prepay for goods. As for China's exports to Russia, according to information obtained by reporters from the trade sector, the situation is the opposite. China's exports to Russia mainly consist of soybeans and tea, with soybeans accounting for 76% of the total exports to Russia and tea accounting for 9%. Since the resumption of Sino-Russian relations, exports of soybeans and tea have once been stimulated, but because the Russian government often delays payment for Chinese export goods, and sometimes pays only after a year or several months after the goods have been shipped, and the receipts they issue are not formal receipts and cannot be discounted at banks, small merchants are unwilling to export due to the inability to circulate capital. Therefore, exports to Russia are currently extremely undeveloped.</p>

<h3>Going Abroad to Study Aviation</h3>
<p>Telegraphed from Hong Kong to Shanghai Yesterday, Will Go to Italy</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Bingheng, former Director of the Aviation Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs, was ordered by the National Government last month to go abroad to study aviation in order to learn from it. Huang recently telegraphed a friend in Shanghai from Hong Kong, saying that he has already arrived in Hong Kong and will soon leave his beloved motherland. This trip is under the order of Chairman Chiang of the Military Affairs Commission. He will first go to Italy for six months, and then go to Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States before returning home by a roundabout route. After returning to the country, he may propose to the government to organize an aviation ministry.</p>

<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Submits to the Ministry of Finance</p>
<h3>Promptly Establish a Plan to Rectify Auxiliary Currency Abuses</h3>
<p>Unify Silver Coin Minting</p>
<p>Strictly Prohibit Private Smuggling</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, requesting that a plan be promptly established to rectify abuses in auxiliary currency. The original text reads: "Respectful salutations to the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing. On the 25th of this month, according to a letter from the Fresh Pork Industry Association, members Chunyuan and others reported that since the government resolved to change the tael to the yuan, the silver market has been unified, and accounting has become convenient, greatly benefiting merchants and the public. However, the types of silver coins are not uniform, and the quality varies. There are no less than twenty or thirty kinds of silver coins currently circulating in the city. The silver content and exchange rates vary, with many different names such as Xiamen official issue, Dalian, Changsha, New Year 9, Year 11, thick edge, and Da Zhuang, making it impossible to enumerate them all. Merchants often lose two or three yuan per hundred yuan in the process of turnover. In total, these unnecessary losses amount to a considerable sum annually. Merchants have suffered losses for years and are in deep distress. Therefore, we specifically request your association to promptly forward the situation to the government authorities to strictly prohibit these practices in order to alleviate merchants' difficulties. According to this, it is found that the city is flooded with inferior coins, and our respective industries have suffered significant losses. The fundamental solution seems to be to request the financial authorities to find a way to collect and remelt them, and at the same time, request government agencies to strictly prohibit these practices in order to benefit business. According to the Coinage Regulations of the Republic of China, the quality of auxiliary coins was set at 70% silver and 30% copper, and at the same time, it was stipulated that they were obligated to exchange coins at ten-cent intervals. However, the mints in various provinces only benefited from the low silver content and recklessly minted coins for profit, and the ten-cent exchange has not been implemented. The abuses have increased day by day. Therefore, the Beijing Currency Bureau adopted the suggestion of the former Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and jointly ordered the customs to strictly prohibit imports. If private smuggling is discovered, the goods will be confiscated. This ban has been in effect to this day and has not changed. How is it that, according to the association, there are as many as twenty or thirty kinds of smuggled coins circulating in Shanghai? Clearly, the ban has not been strictly enforced, which hinders the rectification of the currency system. In view of the aforementioned situation, we respectfully request that your ministry review and approve it, promptly establish a rectification plan, and unify minting to recover and remelt the coins. At the same time, strictly investigate private smuggling and prevent it from spreading, so that the root cause can be addressed and merchants and the market can suffer fewer losses. This would be beneficial to the public. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce respectfully submits."</p>

<p>Electricity: The Shanghai Electric Power Company has been supplying electricity to the road sections beyond the boundaries of the Shanghai Western District, where the number of residents has increased daily and factories are densely packed, leading to an increasing demand for electricity. However, the Municipal Government believes that this matter is related to sovereignty and has made a proposal to the central government. It is understood that the Municipal Government intends to negotiate with the Municipal Council to take back the road sections beyond the boundaries, so that the problem can be resolved incidentally. However, the matter of taking back the road sections has been delayed and has not been resolved. Therefore, the central government convened a meeting of the Ministries of Industry and Foreign Affairs and the Municipal Government to discuss solutions. The Municipal Government sent Xu Peihuang, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and Zheng Baocheng, Section Chief of the Second Section of the Bureau, to participate. All parties made valuable contributions. It is reported that the central government will soon finalize the principles based on the opinions of all parties and hand them over to the Municipal Government for handling.</p>
<p>Telephone: The issue of telephones on roads beyond the boundaries has been fraught with twists and turns and has not been resolved. According to unofficial news received by the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, the dispute between the French Concession and the Shanghai Telephone Company has now been resolved. The Shanghai Telephone Company is currently preparing to sign an agreement. After the signing, the temporary agreement on telephones on roads beyond the boundaries should be signed in the shortest possible time.</p>

<h3>Advocates Delaying Aviation School and Establishing a Factory</h3>
<p>Association to Hold Board Meeting This Week to Discuss</p>
<p>The Sixth Executive Committee Meeting of the China Aviation Association resolved to establish a civil aviation school and proposed that association director Lin... go to Hangzhou to borrow the Hongqiao Airport and training aircraft from Director Ge of the Aviation Administration. However, Director Ge stated that the most urgent task is to establish an aircraft factory.

It was decided to convene a board meeting this week to discuss and decide.</p>
<h3>New Changes in the Nanyang Labor Dispute</h3>
<p>Union Opposes Arrest of Workers</p>
<p>Issues Declaration Requesting Assistance</p>
<p>The labor-management dispute at the Nanyang Tobacco Factory initially came to an end after mediation by the party and government. Unexpectedly, the union reported that Wu Linkun, the legal counsel of Nanyang, instructed the arrest of workers, causing widespread panic. This morning, they filed a petition with the party and government for intervention and sent a letter to the Lawyers Association to discipline Wu Linkun, issuing a second declaration and a letter to workers. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Petition for Intervention: The Fourth District Cigarette Industry Union, upon hearing that Wu Linkun, the legal counsel of Nanyang Tobacco Factory, had instructed the arrest of workers, dispatched Standing Director Zhou Xuexiang and Nanyang Office staff Zhang Zhang, Weng Lin, Wang Jiansheng, Qian Yungeng, and others to petition the Social Bureau this morning at 9:15 AM, requesting prompt intervention. The director of the mediation section, Wang Xianqing, received them and immediately went to Nanyang to meet with Manager Jian Yujie. Because Jian was out, it was decided to visit again at 3:00 PM this afternoon.</p>
<p>Union Statement: According to a union director, Wu Linkun is destroying the labor movement and instructing the arrest of workers, so the Nanyang incident is difficult to be optimistic about for a while. Some workers have decided to enter the factory to work today. As for the staff, they will wait for the Social Bureau to visit the manager this afternoon and see what the outcome is. According to the workers, they are determined to resist to the death. In short, if the company intends to shirk responsibility, this union will only quietly wait for the party and government organs to intervene as soon as possible.</p>

<p>British Man Martin Hunting</p>
<h3>Settles Case of Injuring People in Pinghu County</h3>
<p>Two British men, Martin and his brother, were hunting within the territory of Pinghu County, Zhejiang Province, on October 30th of last year, and accidentally injured villagers Fei Jinkui and Zhou Pan. At that time, the Pinghu County Magistrate and the Shanghai Municipal Government exchanged official letters with the British Consul-General and requested compensation of 1,140 yuan for lost wages during the injury period and 142 yuan for medical expenses. The British Consul-General ordered Martin to contact the injured parties himself. According to reports, Martin has negotiated with Fei Jinkui and Zhou Pan and has agreed to accept 550 yuan as a settlement, and is currently preparing to pay it.</p>
<h3>Municipal Bank Moves Today</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Visits in Person</p>

Leaders from the city's industrial, commercial, and financial sectors went to congratulate. Mayor Wu, accompanied by Secretary-General Yu, visited in person at around 11:00 AM and hosted the guests.</p>
<h3>Parricide Sentenced</h3>
<p>Ignorance and Superstition Cannot</p>
<p>Lessen the Deserved Punishment</p>
<p>Chen Along, a Ningbo man and worker at the Waterworks Company, had two children with his wife who died young. Therefore, he superstitiously believed in the customs of Ningbo, thinking that if he sacrificed another child, his future children would have long lives. This time, his wife gave birth to another son, and three days later, the child suddenly fell ill. He decided to kill it and invited his friend Wang Jinyan, a Shaoxing man, to his home at No. 465 Xinzha Road on the night of the 18th of this month. He carried the sick child out the back door, and Chen killed it with a sharp kitchen knife, placed the body in a bamboo basket, and asked Wang to carry it to Suzhou Creek to discard it. They were arrested midway and handed over to the First Special District Court. The court interrogated and detained Chen and Wang, and the child's body was examined and handed over to the Charitable Hall for coffin preparation. The case was reported in detail in the previous issue. This morning, Judge Qian Wenji of the court presided over the Eighth Tribunal and ordered that the two defendants, Chen and Wang, be brought forward for further interrogation. Wang Yaotang, the lawyer of the police station, stated that the body had been examined by the prosecutor and confirmed to have died from a knife wound to the head. Therefore, the two defendants had indeed violated Article 282 of the Criminal Code on murder and should be interrogated. Questioned, Chen Along confessed that because the child was about to die and could not be saved, he ordered Wang Jinyan to carry it to the alley and killed it himself. This is a Ningbo custom, and if I had known it was illegal, I would not have done it. Wang Jinyan also confessed that although he carried the child out, he did not know that Chen would personally kill it. Then the debate began. The police lawyer argued that Chen killed his own son, and Wang helped and disposed of the body. These facts have been confessed by the defendants. However, the defendants claimed ignorance and said that it was illegal. Article 28 of the Criminal Code stipulates that criminal responsibility cannot be exempted due to ignorance of the law. They should be punished for murder, but if the court believes that the circumstances of the crime are excusable, then the punishment should be reduced. The defendants' lawyer argued that the defendants are both ignorant and deeply poisoned by superstition, and committed this cruel act and violated the law. Their crime is deserved, but their situation is excusable and should be dealt with leniently. Judge Qian immediately announced the verdict: Chen Along's sentence for murder was reduced to two years and six months of imprisonment. Wang Jinyan's sentence for attempted abandonment of the body was reduced to three months of imprisonment. The murder weapon was confiscated.</p>

<h3>Trying to Cover Up is More Revealing</h3>
<p>— A Young Fellow</p>
<p>Some people, even when they have made a mistake, always refuse to admit it. Instead, they desperately try to cover it up with sweet words and flowery language, and even try to make it seem grand and legitimate, showing convincingly that they have reasons. However, these reasons are contrived and unnatural. Therefore, the more they try to cover it up, the more they expose their despicable and hypocritical ugliness. The fox's tail is dragged out completely without anything left behind. They are truly the most shameless things in the world! In fact, they are just useless and pathetic creatures.</p>
<p>For example: clearly it is aggression, but they say it is self-defense; clearly there is no solution, but they pretend to be calm and withdraw with a rotten "damn it all"; clearly there are no anti-aircraft guns, but they print "shot down enemy planes" in large letters, regardless of the fact that it is our cheap lives and unprotected properties that are directly suffering! Or: clearly it is a "rumor," but they want to "dispel the rumor"; clearly it is forced donation, but they say it is "integrating prohibition into taxation"; clearly it is promiscuity and fraud, but they say they are "saving the country" with their "beautiful faces"; clearly it is jealousy and slander, but they say it is care and advice... In short, the motive of the perpetrators is to think they are clever, beautiful, good, and true. However, the result is unfortunately very foolish, clumsy, ugly, evil, confused, despicable, useless, and shameless. Trying to cover up is more revealing!</p>
<p>People are always so naturally clever, but in fact, things always go against them and do not go as they wish. This is the so-called "cleverness is ruined by cleverness." There is nothing more regrettable and disappointing than trying to cover up is more revealing.</p>

<h3>Experiment</h3>
<p>— Xian</p>
<p>The weather suddenly turned warm, and an unusual atmosphere floated in the editorial office. By ten o'clock, everything was finished, just waiting for any last-minute telegrams. Xiao Chen, peering at me through his extremely nearsighted glasses, said half-jokingly, "Little brother, let's play 'the game' again!"</p>
<p>Ever since that one time with "the game," the words "the game" were often jokingly attached to "little brother" when work was leisurely. And "small person, big heart" was always used for teasing, even though I hadn't played "the game" even once, I was already like a graduate of "the game," forced to participate in all kinds of "the games." Why, with an out-of-tune voice, did He give a double-handed "approve! support!" immediately after Xiao Chen finished speaking.</p>
<p>This time I was hastily dragged to ××'s place; the reputation of "little brother" had already been declared bankrupt, and it was my first time stepping into such a place. The shortcut to a young person's downfall probably starts at this time: here are the bright lights, the warm flesh, and the fragrant scents, while "national crisis" and other names are things they wouldn't remember even if their eyebrows were on fire. Although I didn't have the actions of Grandma Liu, who was at a loss when she stepped into the Grand View Garden, an inexplicable delusion floated up for a moment. I sat quietly on the side, smoking the cigarette that ×× offered. Xiao Chen pushed ×× in front of me and said, "This is little brother, 'the game' is not small!" After speaking, he was even more pleased than when he scammed a cigarette at the newspaper office.</p>
<p>"Spring sleep is unaware of dawn, everywhere hears the crowing of birds..." He, as if getting revenge for being tricked last time, attacked me from both sides.</p>
<p>At this time, ×× gently stroked my shoulder with the familiar so-called hypnotic soup, saying, "Little brother is really honest."</p>
<p>I felt a hot and uncomfortable sensation on my face. I wanted to know if my face had already "turned off." Fortunately, the air here wouldn't embarrass people for long. A set of national products from the year were placed between the red and green brocade quilts. The three of them quickly lay down on either side, and ×× patted the remaining corner of the bed, meaning to support my participation. Afraid of even more embarrassing words coming out of their triumphant laughter, I sat over there calmly. Thus, all the unbelievable conversations began while advocating "national products."</p>
<p>Shanghai is known as a city that never sleeps; and this place is even more so a city that never sleeps within a city that never sleeps. A red girl will never see the sun; what a cruel punishment! But looking at the hearts of those who play "the game" of watching cats eat mice, their enjoyment comes at a considerable price. What a justified and confident answer! Shanghai is ultimately heaven above hell!</p>
<p>Time passed like lightning. Xiao Chen and He were intoxicated with the enjoyment of flesh and had no intention of returning. I, existing between them, also didn't have any fundamental need, or perhaps they had forgotten such an uninteresting hanger-on. I secretly slipped out. The chartered cars for electricity and lights were busy traveling through the lanes. The night of Shanghai was still sending a group of young people to hell with full vigor.</p>
<p>Stepping onto the road, the ghostly figures of miserable cries in the darkness were embellished under the neon lights. My momentary unintentional joke almost caused me to fall into the doorway of hell. Walking home slowly, I raised my head and hoped that Shanghai's sky would have a day when the clouds would clear and be bright.</p>
<p>"Experiment," I wrote in my diary in extra-large letters, so that every time I opened it, I would be startled and recall the last step I took on the threshold of hell.</p>
<h3>New Warlords Donate Funds</h3>
<h3>Dusk</h3>
<p>— Xian</p>
<p>At dusk, leaning on the railing, the window was filled with wisps of rain, and the buildings in the distance were hazy like smoke; and the glittering neon lights were just the beginning of the city's nightlife.</p>
<p>Cars came from afar, one after another, and then drove off into the distance: two distinct tire tracks were drawn on the damp road, only to be erased by those that came later.</p>
<p>The crowd that poured out of the movie theater was surrounded by rickshaw pullers, who hoped to get enough from the rewards of the pleasure-seekers in this urban squeeze to maintain their lives tomorrow. However, they were met with the unfilial curses of "pigs"; the red race, forgetting the hatred of national subjugation, raised their wooden sticks, displaying the majesty of imperialism, while the Jiangbei compatriots retreated backward, the crowd that poured out of the theater—those in suits and high-heeled leather shoes—already stepped onto their rickshaws.</p>
<p>In the restaurants, the tables were filled with free-spirited friends who didn't want to go home for dinner. They were not holding farewell parties for those going to the Northeast full of hot blood, nor were they giving welcome parties for the disabled who had returned from the front lines after being injured; they were merely there to "connect with each other" or to have an important job to do after eating their fill. The wine-serving prostitutes, in pairs, laughed and rushed in like a gust of wind, because only then could the seated guests be encouraged to eat harder.</p>
<p>Jai alai and dog racing, with their huge advertisements, attracted dreamers who were obsessed with wealth. After trading their pants to "blow their hair," like trading their lives, a group, a pile. Their fate was controlled by balls and dogs, as they hoped that the numbers they bought on the red and green papers would win the prize. After a burst of commotion, the faces were flushed, the mouths were open, and their fate was controlled by balls and dogs.</p>
<p>Of course, places like Yanzikou were also filled with enthusiasts who never tired of it. The public relations officers of the old guns shouted the sign "female reception" from their hoarse throats. This trick could make a large number of new members join their pipe-blowing club; the development of the club was due to the efforts of new and old members. Dusk was just a fixed meeting time, which was then extended to dawn, all day...</p>
<p>On Avenue Joffre, the sound of music swayed in the mysterious air, black coffee, red lips, the climate was always spring. The electric lights were changed to dark green, and all kinds of leather shoes rolled around on the floor, women, white legs, temptation, creating news for the social pages.</p>
<p>The dusk's rain trickled in the Yangshupu area, and the consumptive female workers carried small baskets, sending their tired bodies home. At that moment, while the people of the city were still enjoying themselves to the full, the factory whistles sent them into the squeezing machine again.</p>
<p>At dusk, leaning on the railing, the window was filled with wisps of rain, and the buildings in the distance were hazy like smoke; and the glittering neon lights were just the beginning of the city's nightlife.</p>
<h3>Strange or Not?</h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>This morning, while reading our newspaper, I came across a news item that seemed rather peculiar. It was about the socialite Ms. Xue Jinyuan allegedly seducing the Italian youth, Mr. Joseoh, a reporter. The incident was so bizarre that the editors added a cautionary note at the beginning: "…Usually, only men entice women into acts of lust. However, recently, there have been instances of women attempting to seduce men. What is especially odd is that the man being seduced is an underage European youth. This truly proves that on the great sea, there is nothing that does not exist."</p>
<p>Indeed, indeed, this matter is quite intriguing! To us young folks, it's something to laugh about, evoking a nameless interest or a few strange sexual feelings. But that's about it. If this were to reach the ears of the old-timers from the late Qing Dynasty, and they were to learn that the world now has such beastly tricks, I cannot believe they wouldn't stomp their feet and tear at their beards, cursing this society, this world, even cursing heaven and earth, cursing all the gods and spirits.</p>
<p>Indeed, indeed, this matter is truly odd!</p>
<p>However, in all fairness, it is not so strange!</p>
<p>We know that our ancient country, after being invaded by Westernization, has lost its ethical teachings. This kind of lustful seduction is an inevitable phenomenon, an activity that the leisured class cannot avoid. Even if we glance at the village women in the inland, they are no longer in the situation of being "raised in seclusion, never leaving their homes." Now, many have learned to sing lewd songs and know how to respond to men's advances. There must be many who are having affairs.</p>
<p>Moreover, this is Shanghai, directly nurtured by capitalism, the dazzling and luxurious "Paris of the East." For the wealthy leisured class, the long twenty-four hours of the day, even if they leave the dance halls, they can still run to the theaters, and after the grand dinners, they turn to the cafes. But the long, slow twenty-four hours are still difficult to endure. If they don't find some amusement to soothe their spirits and indulge their desires, it would be a waste of their natural gifts. Thus, the skilled hands of the women of leisure are put to use, and thus, the youth Joseoh is seduced by a woman. I think such activities have happened many times in the past, but they were not announced to society as this time. Perhaps the seduced youth did not contract some hidden disease, and therefore did not prompt his parents to file a complaint with the authorities. Indeed, I have seen news-style reports of women raping men, and many friends have said that Shanghai is full of such things, mostly involving concubines.</p>
<p>There is also another point that pious men and women should understand: we hear that we are now in an era of gender equality. The facts of men seducing women fill the pages of newspapers every day, so common that they are no longer strange. But when women seduce men, it is considered strange, strange, resounding in our ears. It is too difficult to shed the old shell. I think that if men can seduce women, women may as well seduce men. This would make things balanced and might even be an aid to achieving gender equality.</p>
<p>The socialite Xue Jinyuan has her own car, and even a father famous for his wealth. And the so-called Italian youth Joseoh also has a good father who is a manager, or perhaps a naturally beautiful face. They are both wealthy and have nothing to do? The youth has a moment of sexual frenzy, and the deed is done. If they had to earn a living with their own hands, readers, just look at this world, would there be such amusing things?</p>

<p>Apprentice: Mr. Song, this person wants to see you.</p>
<p>Mr. Song: …… (Doesn't speak, Mr. Song's arrogant attitude.)</p>
<p>Apprentice: Go talk to him yourself! (Says to the writer, then exits.)</p>
<p>Writer: Are you Mr. Song? I've heard of you for a long time.</p>
<p>Mr. Song: Uh… (Mr. Song makes a sound in his throat, still smoking without speaking.)</p>
<p>Writer: Mr. Song: Because I have a manuscript, I came specifically to see you, sir. May I ask if you would consider it?</p>
<p>Mr. Song: No, no. It's always the same old stuff: lost love! Suicide! Who wants to see that?</p>
<p>Writer: Mr. Song, this is not the usual kind. Please take a look. If you agree, I can accept a lower fee.</p>
<p>Mr. Song: No! You even want to sell this peanut-sized writing. The bookstore owner can't even afford to eat. No, please go outside. This is an office!</p>
<p>Writer: Mr. Song, then buy it at paper price.</p>
<p>Mr. Song: I said no, no, what are you still nagging about? I don't run a peanut shop. Humph!</p>

<h3>It Looks Like He Won't Be Long for This World</h3>
<p>Chicken Feather Factory Worker</p>
<p>Mr. Editor: I am a female worker in a chicken feather factory in eastern Shanghai, not a shop employee. I don't know if you can answer my questions. My husband used to be the supervisor (driver) in the engine room of a yarn factory here. One day, because the belt on a large machine broke, it hit his leg and turned him into a cripple. Thanks to the kindness of the gentlemen in the factory, in addition to treating him, they now have him issuing tokens in the coal yard, with a monthly wage of eight yuan. Eight yuan a month in Shanghai is certainly not enough to live on, so I had to find work. After searching for a long time, I finally found it: the chicken feather factory where I now work, where I pick chicken feathers. At that time, our son, our only son, was only eight months old. If he had been born into a wealthy family, he would probably still be "sensitive to the wind, like tender meat," treasured and pampered. But because I had to eat, I couldn't care. Every morning, sometimes when he was still dreaming, I had to harden my heart, wake him up, and take him to the factory with me. While I work, I temporarily use a piece of the floor beside me as his bed. The situation in the chicken feather factory, Mr. Editor, you probably don't understand. The whole room is filled with chicken feather dust, making it difficult to breathe. I, probably because I'm older, and in good health, so apart from feeling thinner and more yellow every day, there are no other symptoms. But our little darling is not well; he is now skin and bones, doesn't even look like a human, and has to spit up three or four mouthfuls of blood every day. It looks like he won't be long for this world. Alas!</p>
<p>Mr. Editor, think about it, our family of three: my husband, because he made money for the factory owner, although he didn't lose his life, he is already half-dead; my son, he not only hasn't received any benefits from the factory, but sometimes he is even hated by them, but he will ultimately have to sacrifice for them; as for me, seeing myself getting thinner and more yellow every day, plus this worry, it's easy to imagine. So we are bound to sacrifice, but where is the price of the sacrifice? (Omitted below) Sincerely, Zhang Cuie</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Ms. Zhang's letter, especially the last two sentences, "We are bound to sacrifice, but where is the price of the sacrifice?" The two sentences are truly heartbreaking to read. You see, Ms. Zhang's husband was injured not because of his own fault. In theory, the factory should provide generous compensation, at least paying him his original salary until the end of his life. Now, the factory only gives him eight yuan a month, and they are not even willing for him to sit and enjoy it, but have him issuing tokens in the coal yard; in fact, there is really no kindness to speak of. But in Ms. Zhang's words, she still says again and again, "This is thanks to the kindness of the gentlemen in the factory." I really don't understand, the workers are so gentle, why do capitalists still oppress them every day? As for the plight of Ms. Zhang's son, it is even more tragic. Don't think that because China has 400 million people, the death of one or two doesn't matter; but we must think about how many female workers there are in China, which female worker doesn't have a son, and which female worker's children can avoid this tragic fate. Thinking this way, the problem becomes serious. In all countries around the world, especially the Soviet Union, there are so-called "daycare centers" in factory areas. All the children of workers can be sent there every day, and many women are specially employed to take care of them. After work is finished, they can be picked up; and no fees are charged to the workers. We like to imitate foreigners in everything, especially those who have the responsibility of "seeking the happiness of workers," why are they unwilling to imitate this good aspect of foreigners, but instead learn their "dancing" and "eating fancy meals"? Has this kind of organization for seeking the happiness of workers stopped working, or has the person in charge of this organization died? It's really puzzling.</p>

<h3>Time in a Dream (Thirteenth Installment)</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Wu Yi revealed half of his body, leaning on the cotton pillow, and opened this colored box with surprise. Inside, it was a large stack of papers and a long letter without an envelope.</p>
<p>This was written by Lin Daping, more than seven pages in total. After reading the first page, Wu Yi's hazy eyes widened like an angry person, and his fingers trembled slightly. After reading the second page, his whole body shook... third page, fourth page... by the time he finished reading, even his two bright red lips had turned grayish-white, and his hands were as cold as if they had just been iced in ice water. There was a passage:</p>
<p>"Now, I have been forcibly pushed to a position where there are only two ways out: first, to beg you shamelessly, asking you to leave me some of the joys of life; the second is suicide. If you cannot grant my request, so that I do not implement the second way out, then please act as a voluntary director of my funeral: here I have gathered the general ledger of the Da Wang Company, as well as the list of monetary exchanges between me and relatives and friends, and sent them to you. Tomorrow, you can begin to perform your duties! ..."</p>
<p>Wu Yi read this letter repeatedly several times, and it seemed as if there was a Lin Daping holding a sharp knife, kneeling at his feet, making a miserable and unbearable wail like an old cow before slaughter.</p>
<p>"Hahaha! ... Hahaha! ..." After being extremely stimulated, manic laughter is also a very common expression of mankind. Wu Yi grabbed a pencil from the table and wrote his reply on the inside of the colored box that Lin Daping had sent, without thinking at all, laughing heartily while leaning back and forth.</p>
<p>The reply he gave to Lin Daping was a very scribbled twenty or thirty words.</p>
<p>"Original items returned, everything can also be returned, but I have my own way out, I will definitely not commit suicide! Please do not worry"</p>
<p>(8) National Anthem</p>
<p>When Wu Yi graduated from the Department of Education, because he was influenced by the traditional concepts of Chinese university students, he was extremely eager to go abroad to study, hoping to drink sand-filtered water for a few years, chew foreign bread for a few years, and then bring back a gilded doctorate: however, at that time, all the money in his family was really not enough to help him achieve this hope, and unknowingly it was delayed for more than five years. In these five years, the first two years were a period of absurdity, and his finances often could not make ends meet. In the last three years, however, due to the increase in income and the tightening of expenses, he accumulated five thousand yuan.</p>
<p>Whenever he found that the numbers on his savings book had increased considerably, he could not help but take out the brochures of European and American universities that his friends had sent him and flip through them. However, five thousand yuan was really too little, and everything in Shanghai firmly attracted him: therefore, he never had the determination to set off.</p>

<h3>Gender Inequality in Hollywood</h3>
<p>— Xirong</p>
<p>In Hollywood, men and women are not equal. Women always benefit, and men always suffer. Take marriage, for example. When getting married, there is an unwritten law that men are not allowed to marry women outside the film industry. Violating this law will inevitably be subject to social sanctions. Many male stars have lost the sympathy of the audience and their position in the industry because they did not follow this rule and married women outside the film industry. But women are absolutely free. Jane Wymann married a lawyer, Marlene Dietrich married a real estate businessman, Ann Sothern married a German engineer, Dolores Costello married an inspector, and Irene Hervey married a lawyer. Their husbands are all people outside the film industry, but their fame and status have not been affected in any way.</p>
<p>After marriage, women always benefit, and men always suffer. When a male star marries a female star, the female star can immediately become popular, and the male star can immediately decline. For example, when Franchot Tone married Joan Crawford, Joan's fame grew day by day, and Franchot Tone declined day by day, which is a good example. Ruth Chatterton and Ralph Forbes are also the same. Before they got married, Ralph was very famous, and Ruth was still an unknown actress. Ralph often promoted her, and later Ruth became famous, and they divorced. Before Bebe Daniels married Ben Lyon, she was also an unknown actress, but once they got married, Ben Lyon's fame gradually faded. According to statistics, almost no male star among the married male and female stars in the Hollywood industry can maintain his original position after marriage.</p>
<p>Speaking of divorce, men are even less of a match for women. Divorced female stars can suffer no loss in terms of money or reputation, and can widely publicize it in newspapers. When men divorce women, especially women outside the film industry, they not only suffer great economic losses, but also run the risk of being hated by society. If the woman is a big star, and the man divorces her, people in the industry and ordinary society will blame all the faults on the man. When Ann Harding divorced her husband Harry Bannister, although it had been arranged in advance, the blow that Bannister suffered made it impossible for him to gain a foothold in Hollywood.</p>
<p>As for the court, many people believe that judges are specifically designed to protect women's rights, specifically to trample on men's rights, and have no justice at all. In court, if a woman can imitate a performance in a movie, shed a few tears, and use some inner performance to show her broken heart, then no matter how sufficient the man's reasons are, he will never have a chance to win.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "Emil and the Detectives"</h3>
<p>— Xin</p>
<p>"Emil and the Detectives," which premiered at the New Light yesterday, is the first of Ufa's children's films to arrive in China.</p>
<p>The story of this film is very plain. It just tells the story of a child who is stolen from on the train, so he secretly follows the thief to Berlin and makes friends with the leader of the Berlin children. Thousands of children capture the thief, and after the police station's verification, this thief is a large criminal who escaped the net. So they recovered the stolen money and received a huge "robbery bounty."</p>
<p>The only good thing about this film is that it does not depart from reality.</p>
<p>Indeed, it promotes many good nature and training; for example, children's gregariousness, courage, sincerity, intelligence, frankness, curiosity, vitality... can increase adults' love and understanding of them. Although the director can not be said to be extremely good, it is also very good. He can make the audience's mood tense to the extreme, and this tension is rationalized. The skillful shots, good sound, meaningful and interesting interludes, and editing have no flaws. Because there are too many exterior scenes, the light often has a gray presentation, which seems to be a fly in the ointment.</p>
<p>The biggest loophole in the film is that the "little detective" runs into the "big thief's" bedroom to deliver breakfast, and the two face each other, but the "big thief" does not recognize him as the person he met on the train, which seems unreasonable. In addition to one or two other small loopholes, because they are not very important, they are not brought up for discussion.</p>
<p>The "childish" places are inevitable, but in order to complete this "children's film," it is not necessary to delve into it.</p>
<p>The scenery is very good, very showing the scenery of Northern Europe, the organization is also compact, and in the fragments, there are often unexpected highlights.</p>
<p>Among the actors, the male child star Ralt WeukhausHams is the best, and some expressions are simply beyond what a child can handle. The other five or six people, such as Jaochim Schaufuss, are all very cute. Many of the "little old men's" actions are really very humorous and funny. The female child star is only Inge Landgut, and her moving is no less than that of adult stars. Especially at the end, when she saw two boys fighting over her, she said, "Before we grow up, I need to love both of you equally," which is how much it reveals innocent innocence! As for the adult actors, she is also very good.</p>
<p>This film fully demonstrates the German national character. For example, when a naughty boy is about to fight for a little girl, another child says, "The thief has not been caught, don't vent your personal grievances first." This kind of rationality is very worthy of our attention!</p>
<p>This film is substantially better than the children's films we have seen, such as "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer" and "Little Lord Fauntleroy." Children can get a lot of good impressions after watching it.</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3>Debatable Points in "Morning in the Metropolis": Why Does Wang Renmei Have to Beg for Pity?</h3>
<p>— Wang Lun</p>
<p>The meaning of the play, Mr. Luo Mingyou has already explained in the special issue. Two young men born of the same father, one gets up at dawn and diligently does good, and the other gets up at dawn and diligently seeks profit. Therefore, it is very meaningful that the film is named "Morning in the Metropolis."</p>
<p>Gao Zhanfei's performance of the little coolie is very good. His several rejections of the rich man's | his father's | favor are enough to show the spirit of the most modern man.</p>
<p>Wang Renmei is lively and innocent, even better than Li Lili's performance in "Daybreak." She should have unlimited achievements in art.</p>
<p>But there is one point that can be discussed, that is, when Wang Renmei is tricked into the rich man's son's room, she initially begs for pity, saying, "Young master, let me go, my father is sick," I think this shows her weakness. She should have questioned him sternly from the beginning, and not softened her attitude, in order to show her spirit!</p>
<h3>Hollywood Film Industry and the Literary World</h3>
<p>— Shi Chun</p>
<p>Film is an art for the masses. The prosperity of the film industry depends on the reviews of the viewing public. Therefore, there is a close relationship between the literary world and the film industry. Hollywood is the world's only film hub. The development of newspapers related to the film industry there surpasses the rest of the world. In the United States, there are no fewer than two hundred types of magazines about film. Except for those affiliated with various companies, the rest can maintain an upright and unbiased stance. Therefore, once a bad film is criticized, it has no place to survive, and once a good film is praised, its reputation increases tenfold.</p>
<p>The power of the literary world is so great that many film actors cultivate relationships with it. When interviewed by reporters, they treat them with utmost sincerity. However, there are many famous actors who not only never connect with the literary world but also find reporters' visits extremely bothersome and keep their whereabouts secret. The most famous for refusing interviews are Tallulah Bankhead, Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford, Little Van Dyke, Ruth Chatterton, Anna Sten, Ann Harding, and others.</p>
<p>Others, such as Mary Pickford and Van Dyke, do not refuse interviews, but they have conditions agreed with the literary world. For example, any news about Mary and Van Dyke must be notified to them in advance for review before being allowed for publication.</p>
<p>The ones with the closest relationships with the literary world are Charlie Chaplin and Will Rogers. Chaplin often writes his own articles and submits them to magazines and newspapers. He once wrote "Impressions of the Film World," which was widely circulated for a time. Will Rogers left the film industry during the silent film era to devote himself to writing. Although he has returned to the film industry, he has not completely abandoned the literary world, and his income from writing is still around $5,000 per week. Others like Eddie Cantor and Groucho Marx also engage in writing during their time away from the screen.</p>
<p>In addition, George Arliss, John Barrymore, Ronald Colman, and Al Jolson all answer questions readily and welcome reporters. Lee Tracy has gone even further, hiring a representative to answer questions on his behalf, with reporters always nearby to avoid any inadequate hospitality.</p>
<h3>Hollywood's German Eccentric Star Marlene Dietrich Always Wears Men's Clothing in Daily Life. Her reason is that choosing women's clothing takes too much time, and women's styles change too quickly. So, often, by the time a fashionable outfit is chosen, it is already out of style before it can be worn.</h3>
<h3>Talking About City Lights</h3>
<p>— Zhou Jingzhi</p>
<p>In order to appreciate art, I braved the rain and drove to West Lake to see "City Lights."</p>
<p>The entire plot is consistent throughout, captivating at every turn, especially the contrast between rich and poor, with powerful subtitles adding considerable value.</p>
<p>Regarding the actors, Ruan Lingyu's sorrowful expressions, Jin Yan's elegant demeanor, Wang Guilin's depth, and Li Keng's liveliness, all beautifully complemented each other.</p>
<p>The photography, especially the rainy scenes and the city's night scenes, are excellent. However, some scenes seem to have lighting that is too dim. The sets and techniques are generally good.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the film does not sufficiently expose the dark side of the city. The few scenes in the dance hall seem too simple. Also, the plot lacks a proper portrayal of the love between the capitalist's son and the laborer's daughter. Why is the capitalist's son so deeply in love? This point is also not clearly explained.</p>
<h3>Many Thefts in Hollywood</h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a sudden increase in thieves in Hollywood, and star thefts have become more frequent. In February of this year, there was a surge in thefts, with the homes of many stars, including Bette Davis, Joan Crawford, Constance Bennett, Sally Eilers, Mae West, and Loretta Young, being visited by burglars. Among them, Bette Davis and Constance Bennett suffered the greatest losses. Davis had a large gemstone and a box of jade worth $37,000 stolen. Bennett had a box of pearl necklaces stolen, worth approximately $30,000.</p>
<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3>Red Dust (9)</h3>
<p>— Jieke</p>
<p>After Gree left, Babelei also changed. He hears the sound of Daniel’s footsteps, and a fresh, bright light radiates from his eyes. He is like someone bewitched, intoxicated in a novel happiness.</p>
<p>“Who is it, barging in without knocking?” One night, Daniel walked into his room and embraced him. He said with a smile, full of tender affection. His lips touched his again.</p>
<p>Daniel thinks of Babelei: his sweetness, gentleness, affection... but he thinks of Gree! A battle between love and righteousness rages within him. He wants to be close to him... he also wants to leave him... never see him again!</p>
<p>Amidst the battle between love and righteousness, Daniel wakes up to the side of righteousness and wants to be a pure person again. He travels a long distance one day to find Gree, to tell him everything. However, he doesn't have the courage to tell him. He rides his horse back alone at dusk. He doesn't go into Babelei's room either. He is somewhat puzzled, hearing him in the living room, placing the gun and clothes on the table, hearing his footsteps going to his own room. He waits quietly, but he doesn't come after all. He grows impatient waiting and gently taps on his door.</p>
<p>“Oh,” he says casually. “You’re not asleep yet.” He leads him to the living room.</p>
<p>“Daniel... have you... told Gree?”</p>
<p>He takes a long breath. He clenches his teeth. Then... he says to him, “You’re not a student anymore!” He says barbarically. “How can you not know what’s important?” He reaches out as if to embrace him, but he trembles and shrinks back. He is extremely disappointed. For a moment, he wants to rush into the jungle and be eaten by a hungry tiger. Then he thinks of Daniel’s handgun lying on the table... then, he sobs and cries.</p>
<p>Daniel is in his own room, hearing their voices, feeling restless. He leans against the wall, listening. There must be trouble... it's never been like this before! (To be continued)</p>
