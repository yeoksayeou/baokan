<p>時評</p>
<h3>日本之戰時豫算實</h3>
<p>日本旣席卷我東北四省。『大陸政策。』可謂巳大部實現。然而事實上並不能彌補其國内之經濟恐慌。失業工人表面雖不過四十八萬。實際則巳超過二百萬。批發物價雖巳提高。而實際仍無補於產業界之窮。且因國家主義盛行之結果。使日本對外貿易愈陷於困難。近印度澳洲皆限制日本製造品之輸入。而我中國則因受日本之侵略。生活更爲枯窘。亦無力以購買外貨。則日本輸出品之受打擊可知。於是日本軍閥以及依附軍部之學者政治家之流。不得不仍高倡其所謂國。難竭力充實陸海軍備。盡量擴大其軍事行動。造作所謂非常時期。以掩蔽其因經濟恐慌而來之内在矛盾。本年度二十三億餘日金之　戰時預算。在日本財政史上已屬空前創舉日本人民之不堪此種巨額負擔。亦可槪見。明年度（一九三四年度）之預算編製。據日本財政部之估計總額將在三十億日金以上。其中陸軍部約占六億日金。海軍約有四億五千萬日金左右。其他如拓務財政。均將相當膨脹。而歲收總計。縱令增加税率。其收入至多亦不過增多三四千萬。於歲出方面並無多大助力。是以塡補赤字除發行内債而外。實無其他適當之方。法然則日本軍閥何以必欲採用此戰時預算而不惜犧牲其國力耶其用意約有數端。第一日本讅知自九一八後蘇聯對日處處持和平的保守政策者。非眞甘心退讓也不過欲完成其第二五年計劃耳現時之和平。决不可恃。故對蘇聯之防備。不得不力。况蘇聯近二年來。巳移其全國發展產業之力。以擴充軍備。即以最新式之機械化兵團而論。蘇聯全國。己有四個師團之多。日本今年縱經一度擴充。其機械化兵團。亦不過兩聯隊其不及遠甚故此次編製陸軍預算。所謂『軍用資材整備費』一項。數達二億五千萬日金大都將使用於此方面。可以斷言。</p>
<p>第二日美之間。近以英日經濟關係之不洽。印度澳洲等地因加税而引起糾紛。英日政治上之諒解旣不可能。日人乃轉而親美。於是日美協　之説。　彌漫全國。然而此種運動亦僅爲一時不自然的粉飾。而太平洋之風雲。依然險惡也。美國建造三十二隻軍艦。顯然爲　　之準備。其中飛行母艦兩隻。各搭飛機二百九十架。非恃足以護衛美　本土且亦可以威脅日本之上空。以故日本之海軍部。亦不得不以四億餘日金。分三期以用之於海軍建造。第三日軍侵華。表面上因塘沽停戰協定簽字而暫告一叚落。在理應不至於擴大。　而關東軍之改編。其所謂『滿洲事變經費。』仍不下一億三四千萬日金。臨時費用尙不在内。武裝移民。將增至每年一千戶。人數在五千以上。其對於華北之野心。並未稍戢。試觀近日津東僞軍之猖獗。即可知其　擾華北之陰謀。正未有艾。</p>
<p>上述三端。即彼軍閥所謂國難。亦即彼所欲造成之非常時期。又安得而不準備此戰時之預算。</p>

<h3>美國傾全力謀國家經濟策實現</h3>
<p>準備勸各國採類似政策</p>
<p>鞏固國際貿易復興基礎</p>
<p>羅斯福召見台維斯有所商詢</p>
<p>（紐約）美國政府、最近對於倫敦會議討論之各種問題、所持態度遊移不定、即美國内部亦頗爲驚異、且覺憂慮、例如穩定美元之説一經傳播、而美國政府立即加以否認、國務卿赫爾近在倫敦之宣言將低减關税問題置諸美元穩定問題之上、國務副卿摩萊突然東渡、且其任務甚爲神秘、凡此種種、均爲輿論所注意者、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）今日自可靠方面探悉美總統雖信恢復國外貿易有助於美國實業、但其復興經濟希望、幾全寄於發展國内市塲、國務卿赫爾雖在經濟會議申請撤銷貿易障壁、而羅斯福總統則巳决定各國國内經濟之回榮實爲復興世界貿易之最直接途徑、以故摩萊之赴英、準備勸各國採用類似美國所施之方案俟大多數國家國内經濟回榮後、則各國將能站於健全之基礎上擴張其國際貿易、否則國際貿易縱能呈一時之興盛、亦未必能有鞏固之基礎、至美總統變更態度原因、由於最近美國市塲内貿易數量己增於一月以前、且觀於預約定單之多、足見貿易之回榮、至少將可繼續數月、因此美總統感覺前此美代表團所視爲主要目的之撤銷貿易障壁、於復興國内經濟之總計畫中、不過等於一枝一節而已且自華盛頓提議减低關税與撤銷其他障壁以來南美及歐洲數國己、紛欲乘機在美推銷、締結互惠條約有妨美國之復興計畫云（廿五日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）自今日發表美政府信經濟會議失敗、不致大妨碍美國經濟回榮計畫後、今夜各大城己多發生再度膨脹通貨之慮、金融界意見、此時美政府旣傾全力提高物價、倘世界經濟會議未能同意於安定銀價、則美政府或將企圖用白銀爲膨脹通貨之具、目下白銀派與黃金派皆亟盼明日將在倫敦貨幣委員會提出之白銀草案、而一般白銀派多預料設倫敦與會各代表拒絶安定銀價於較高水平線之提、則美總統定將自行設法提高銀價、或於硬貨　備金内搭用白銀或廣鑄銀幣、以期達到提高國内所產各貨價格水平線之目的、惟紐約銀行家態度則多反對通貨之再行膨脹、據稱、即新銀行法一項巳夠令若輩憂慮豈可再加以膨脹通貨新運動、蓋格拉士史蒂搿爾之銀行法不久即將實行、因其中有保障一萬元以下存欵之條文、頗不利於銀行家、故紐約銀行界大多數對於新銀行法頗覺惴惴、以爲無論何國尙未嘗有將此保障、作通國試騐者、且經美國八州試騐結果、曾發生重大損失、再該法將節制各銀行之鉅大權力、給予聯邦儲備銀行是否能推行盡利亦覺懷疑、惟銀行、界雖不贊成膨脹通貨逆料美總統定將繼續推行膨脹政策云、（二十五日國民電）</p>
<p>（紐約）據經濟財政通訊社接獲消息、美國國務副卿摩萊奉羅斯福總統之命前往歐洲、將以總統訓令傳達倫敦經濟會議美代表團俾與各主要工業國家談判、實行每星期三十小時工作　度之多方妥協辦法、此項恊定成立以後若有不遵守者則該國輸出之貨物各國應禁止入口、但原料品則不在禁止輸入之列（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（紐約）羅斯福總統雖乘游艇遨游於麻州海濱、然歐洲進行之重要事件、依然在念、據今日消息、美總統巳召台維斯來晤、台爲出席軍縮大會之美代表人素以羅斯福總統之駐歐大使目之、台氏奉命後、即趕赴大西洋海岸、登總統游艇、、而與總統討論世界經濟大會之最近發展</p>

<h3>貨幣小組討論銀問題</h3>
<p>我代表要求迅採安定步驟</p>
<p>印度對調節銀市允予合作</p>
<p>最惠國條文無限制適用</p>
<p>日本擬向各國分頭接洽</p>
<p>（倫敦）世界經濟大會之銀委員會今晨開會、歷時頗短似無進步但幕後現正進行討論、衆信他日協定成立、其大旨將以美代表畢特門之银議案爲依歸、（二十六日路透社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）經濟會議貨幣委員會之銀問題小組委員會於今晨舉行非公開會議、由美國代表畢德曼主席此外則有墨西哥、加拿大·秘魯·玻里維亞·印度·中國·西班牙之代表該會議對於是否可訂約限制生銀出售市塲、並限制大批存銀抛售市塲之一節、先行交換意見（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）貨幣委員會之白銀小組委員會、巳得印度合作調節銀市之諾言、今晨開會時、印度代表休士德保證印政府勿以庫存白銀四萬盎斯傾銷於市場、按此項存銀常爲國際市場之威脅、使銀價爲之大跌、今旣得印代表之保證、對於安定銀價已有一大進步、中國代表團顧問貝淞蓀繼起演説、在評論早日恢復金本位議安之際、力勸小組委員會採取儘早安定銀價步驟聲稱中國所急需者在於銀價之安定、不問其對於黃金比價之高低、銀價漲落不定、已使中國在實際上幾乎無從貿易、嗣玻璃維亞與秘魯代表相繼作簡短演説、贊助中國早日安定銀價之主張、迨休會後、主席畢德門語記者、渠覺印度允諾合作後、已法除安定銀價上最大之障礙、目下小組委員會内八國代表顯然皆準備通力合作云、（二十六日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）日本代表團對於世界經濟大會進行之迂緩、漸覺不耐、今日探悉日本代表團擬採一種單獨行動、將向英美法意德等諸國分頭接洽、以期開始兩方面的談判、目的在最惠國條文之無限制的適用、但聞日代表團在數日内暫無舉動、蓋希望今已在途之美總統羅斯福顧問摩萊博士或能携來新訓令、予大會以新衝動也、但英國官塲對大會之進行、則表示樂觀、以爲大會現所逹之階叚、較諸預料已早一星期、今日美代表團聲船稱、摩到倫敦後、美代表團之立塲未必更變云、又一美代表語路透訪員大會因預料摩萊來英、袋中挾有救時良策、反有會務進行徐緩之危險此種希望須不出合理範圍、否則大會將失望矣云（二十六日路透社電）</p>

<h3>經濟外交政策</h3>
<p>（東京）日本外務·大藏·商工等省因世界經濟會議前途、依然希望薄弱、會議之失敗將必招致國際通商競爭之激烈化、現已考慮會議閉幕後之經濟政策、外務省决定今後集其全力於經濟外交、關於如次各點進行研究中、</p>
<p>（一）新市塲之開拓在『滿洲國』菲洲東部及南部近東諸國、南美各國太平洋諸島推廣日貨售路、又增派商務官發揮保護輸出法律之機能、以計新市塲之合理的開拓、</p>
<p>（二）採用互惠主羲爲開拓新市場或維持舊市塲、於必要時與對方國家訂立互惠協定、規定關税政策或分担進口制、度但以日本年來所主張之發揮最惠國條文機能爲原則、</p>
<p>（三）實行輸出統制廢除日本輸出商人間無統制的競爭、及傾售政策之弊害、現行之輸出組合法、改爲强制參加制度、最重實行統制尤、其對於海外市塲之傾售實行有效的防止辦法、</p>
<p>（四）對英印政策勉强與英貨競爭之事、須要避免日印通商問題亦發見合理的妥恊點、以期圓滿解决、又極力防止印日問題之波及於坎拿大南菲洲及澳洲等之通商關係、日本與此等屬自治政府之關係、以互惠手叚調劑、（二十六日日聯社電）</p>
<p>中東路賣買交涉</p>
<h3>俄僞會議開始</h3>

<p>政治問題料亦將議及</p>
<p>（東京）中東路收買交涉會議、本日下午二時在日外次官邸開幕、三方出席代表如下、</p>
<p>（蘇俄方面）駐日大使由禮尼夫·遠東部長哥資奥斯斯·中東路俄方代表柯資尼作夫及其他隨員等、（日本方面）内田外相·重光次官·東鄕歐美局長·西歐美第一課長·陸軍省軍事課員鈴木中佐·駐俄大使館書記官宫川·外務省職員淸水、（僞國方面）僞駐日公使丁士源·僞外次大橋忠一·中東路僞代表沈瑞麟</p>

<p>（東京）中東路讓買交涉之主要目的、爲决定買收之價格及其條件然其實際、俄日『滿』政治上問題之觀法如、何能制本案解决之死命、故會議似不得不言及如次政治問題（一）俄日不侵犯條約問題、（二）俄國抛棄北　太問題、（三）沿海省俄日漁業權問題、故今次會議可視爲往年日俄戰爭後朴資茅會議之修正會議（二十六日日聯電）</p>
<h3>我抗議規尙未公布</h3>
<p>（南京）我國抗議蘇俄出售中東路問題、、所分致日俄之抗議書、俟送達兩政府時即公布當中俄復交之初因有商訂互不侵犯條約之議、我方主張追認一九二四年中俄恊定爲有效其中當包括中東路問題在内俄方現所藉口之推一理由、爲中國不能在該路執行職權、此乃未能確認僞組織產生上之法律點、且殊忽視中國在條約上所取得之合法利益、至互不侵犯條約、當正在研商之際、俄方竟洩露我國重要意見、致起日人收買該路之積極動作、外部己向俄方提出質問、（二十六日專電）</p>
<h3>中東路讓售之背景</h3>
<p>（東京）中東路出售交涉會議今日開幕俄外交部長李維諾夫於五月二日在莫斯科對日太田大使口頭提議此事以來、未滿五十日而逹到正式交涉之地步、其原因蓋有如次三國之立塲及主張故也、（一）『蘇俄之立場』蘇俄因中東路最近繼續虧折且因『滿洲國』之出現該鐵路政治經濟的價値减少、認其前途無希望、遂决定出賣鐵路、然抛棄鐵路爲在俄國國策之重大轉換故、政府内部亦有反對意見、然史丹林李維諾夫等精通遠東情勢之一派主張有力、遂决定出賣（二）『僞國之立塲『滿洲國』原有計劃、樹立鐵道政策包圍中東路使其鐵路效用消减、『滿洲國』又認蘇俄在該路之權利非所有權、係俄『滿』兩國之共同經營權、故信今次會議爲買收此共同經營權之交涉、（三）『日本之立場』日本對於今次交涉、僅取斡旋之勞、而限其買收行爲爲純粹之商業交易性質、故如蘇俄提出政治問題使會議陷於紛、糾則有决意向其斷然邁進、（二十六日日聯電）</p>
<h3>法使要求保留債權</h3>
<p>（東京）駐日法國大使馬德爾今日上午十一時往日外務省訪重光次官、表示對於中東路出售問題法國所抱之意見、謂帝俄當時、俄國爲欲建設中東路、由法國資本家借欵六百萬金盧布、自一九一七年革命以、來並未淸還本息、巴黎政府已接到中東出售公報、命本使向日政府鄭重聲明法國資本家决保持原有權利、切望日政府十分留意重光次官答云、關於中東路債務、於一九二四年之聲明、已切實證明其責任在俄國政府而且日本又非收買該路之對手、故不能負責、此議甚望法國政府對俄滿兩國提出、日政府不能保證法國債權云、（二十六日華聯電）</p>
<h3>美報謂中俄有密約</h3>
<p>（東京）收買中東路交涉開始之際、芝加哥日日新聞之國外特派員裘利斯胡特、今日在東京發表建設該鐵道中俄秘密條約之内容、該約第四條、中政府爲俄陸軍不得接近侵略地點起見、同意於黑龍江吉林兩省得建設横斷該兩省往海參崴方面之鐵道至該鐵道之建設、其目的在攻擊日本若日本當時知有該密約、則於一九○五年之朴資茅會議時、日本當然連滿洲均奪取之、而於今或無此收買交涉也、又該密約之正文胡特謂現尙保管於美國務院云、（二十六日電通社電）</p>

<h3>英俄通商談判</h3>
<p>（倫敦）解决英俄貿易戰問題、今晨已有若干進步、英外相西門與蘇俄外交委員李維諾夫會談半小時後、海外貿易局長柯維爾即發公報聲稱、西門與李維諾夫在外部交換意見、互相説明本國政府對於現有英俄通商談判障碍之地位、並表示日内將再行會晤、按今日柯維爾之參與談話、足見重行商訂商約之條件、亦與開釋英工程師撤消俄貨禁令問題一仝談及、今晨俄外交委員李維諾夫在赴英外部前曾語記者云、解决英俄衝突之可能性繫於英外相之提議、莫斯科政府堅持英國必需撤消禁令、作爲調解爭執之第一步、（廿六日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）今晨蘇俄外交委員李維諾夫與英外相西門相晤時、聞李氏曾建議英國取締俄貨禁令、於七月二十日滿期後不再賡續、李氏便可向蘇俄中央執行委員會提議釋放兩英工程師、但西門尙未接受、又聞李維諾夫不日將有驚人之舉、與小協約國締結不侵犯條約、更聞荷蘭曾陰示倘在荷俄貿易上、能使目下荷國之入超變爲出超則荷政府可以承認蘇俄、但李維諾夫堅持外交承認、須在商訂任何商務辦法之前、（廿六日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）蘇俄方面對於外交委員李維諾夫與西門外相之會晤甚爲緘默、據一般印象均謂英俄談判、如欲其成功、則費時甚久、且極艱難、蓋蘇俄似不願讓步也東京籌建</p>

<h3>各省擴大要求</h3>
<p>大藏省甚感困離</p>
<p>六月二十日東京日日新聞云、大藏省當局、經閣議决定、嚴守緊縮方針、對於放漫無限之預算、極力抑止、以謀减少赤子公債之發行、然而明年度預算編成之際、各省依然有提出相當多額要求之勢、惟大藏省無論如何、力圖撙節、並决定方針如下、（一）對於一般新要求、如屬於案急不得已之經費、自可承認、但須查定其是否有效適切使用、（二）最近由主計局派事務官赴各地視察時局匡救事業實施狀况、認有减少餘地、（三）滿洲事件費、在八年度計算一億八千六百萬元、今熱河己平靖、九年度自　滅少、（四）兵備改善費、不得不注重於政治的考慮、故須由事務當局嚴密查定、（五）極力節約旣定繳費、本以上五項方針切實施行、但各省皆有特殊關係、能否遵照大藏省之意、尙屬疑問、例如</p>
<h3>海軍省</h3>
<p>對於此次編成預算、因鑑於内外情勢、倫敦　約之缺陷、鋭意進行第二次補充計畫、並實施兵備改善、最近因美國太平洋艦隊大擴張、大西　　　小、　　統一的大海軍建設、使日本　　不安、故日本不得不實行第二次　充計　、如新艦船維持費、艦艇　造費·水陸整理費·艦船整　費·軍船品整俯費·航空　維持及設備費等約一億二三千萬、兵備改警費約五千萬、即明年度預算、比本年度增加五六千萬元、</p>
<h3>農林省</h3>
<p>農林省之救農政策、爲多年懸案、　一　　現、因此將由六千萬元之預算、增至一億二千萬元、他如正在調查中之農業保險米生絲以外之農產物國營檢查等、亦須鉅費、</p>
<h3>外務省</h3>
<p>該省爲適應非常時外交方針、要求　成九年度預算時增加經費、其理由（一）因日本旣爲脱退　盟的帝國外交、除極　問題外、關於文化的平和的並社會的事業、　事當以國家的恊力爲本爲欲逹到目的、須新設國際文化　業部、俾得活動自由、（二）因世界經濟復興、日本雖參加會議、然爲防備印度與英帝國與殖民地之經濟的帝國主義發展、急謀確立恒久的經濟外交、（三）爲逹到上列二項目的計、應將在外公使館充實、此外對於埃及·土耳其·與其他近東各國·印度南洋羣島、及滿洲等、與日本貿易有緊密關係、須增設領事館、加派商務官、</p>
<h3>商工省</h3>
<p>商工省在明年度預算、其新定事項、（一）重要工業助成費、輸出統制施設費、重要礦產物　成費、以及關於不正　爭防止費、　約百萬元内外、其他如燃料中汽　之資源　發與統制、亦請追加預算、</p>
<h3>文部省</h3>
<p>該省經去年臨時請會之協　、關於城鎭鄉立尋常小學校費國庫補助法、其補助金爲千二百萬元、又九年度義務敎育費、國庫負担八千五百萬元、其他如防制學生思想問題·學校敎員思想問題等施設、要求之數亦大、</p>
<h3>司法省</h3>
<p>該省新要求總額、除大藏省營繕管理財局之　算外、約二百五十萬元、如刑務所新建費·思想犯罪取締費·地方區裁判所增設費、職員待遇改善費等是、</p>
<h3>鐵道省</h3>
<p>鐵道省在九年度預算、由鐵道單獨之立塲言之、其歲出入如下、資本約計一億四百八十萬元、用品約計一億六千六百萬元、收益約計五億八百萬元、合計歲出約七億七千萬元、其中己决定者、爲鐵道建設費四千萬元、鐵道改良費五千十七萬八千元、省營汽車線設備費三百萬元、合計九千三百十七萬元、歲人方面、資本收入約一億五百萬元、用品工作收入一億六千六百萬元作業收入約計五億六千三百萬元、合計八億三千五百萬元、但因鐵道收益增加、對於鐵道電化事　國際列車延長·旅客貨物輸送設備之改善·省營汽車之擴充·等費均增加、</p>
<h3>拓務省</h3>
<p>該省九年度預算中主要新定事業之要求加巴西移民二萬人、滿洲自衛移民一千人、滿洲一　移民（農工商）十萬家、（一家五人）滿洲移民敎養所設置費、（哈爾濱·奉天·公主嶺·熊岳城等四處）拓務審議會設置費·棉花裁培恊會補助奬勵費·燃料及緬羊恊會補助奬勵費等、數亦甚大、</p>
<h3>遞信省</h3>
<p>該省在九年度要求特别會計、如郵務·電務·工務·經理·貯金·保險。各局等、在特别會計編制、電氣管船航空各局、在尋常會計編制、依額三億五千萬元、他如電報電話之擴張改良、地方郵政局舍之改築、以及航空聯絡運輸補助費等、九年度約計七八十萬元、</p>
<h3>内務省</h3>
<p>内務省對於九年度預算編制之最重要問題、爲時局匡救事業費、仍與八年度預算額相同其間土木費一項、逹九千八百萬元、且絶對不能節減、因此大藏省方面、雖欲極力緊縮、而就各省之新要求觀之、反有增無減、財政前途、頗感困難云</p>

<p>路局負責人談</p>
<h3>麥站改定裝卸費經過</h3>
<p>用費完全依照運輸細則</p>
<p>同時並顧全到工人生活</p>
<p>中央社云、兩於京滬滬杭甬鐵路管理局撒銷麥根路站裝卸工人合作社一事、前日報載兩路工會負責人談、新承辦人於裝卸費中提去二成、及各項加價經過等、中央社記者、特以此詢問該局負責人、據談如下、</p>
<h3>承辦費之規定</h3>
<p>本局此次與楊恒貞訂定承辦裝卸麥根路貨物合同、完全依照鐵道部所定『中華民國鐵路貨車負責運輸辦事細則』附件第五種『承辦裝卸鐵路貨物辦法』辦理、規定承辦人應得之酬金、爲裝卸總額之百分之十、當時爲體恤工人起見、規定將原定裝卸費一角八分、全部歸工人所得、另加裝卸費二分、作爲承辦人之酬金、故改定裝卸費爲每噸二角、同時規定於此每噸二角裝卸費外、絶對不許向客商再有需索、如是則客商表面雖增出二分一噸之裝卸費、實際减輕額外之負担頗詎、工人亦可每噸實得裝卸費一角八分、較諸以前、尙須從中提出種種開支、每噸僅得約一角二分三者、自較優厚、乃謂於每噸二分承辦費之外、尙須於一角八分中提出二成、歸承辦人所得、殊爲無稽、又該工會所談承辦人每月可得承辦費數目、有麥站裝卸費、在此靑黃不接之際、月約五千元、今就加二分計、則此承辦人月可坐獲千元之厚利、再益以從工人中抽二成、月可獲二千元等語、依吾儕計算、如每日裝卸費五千元、就加二分計、則承辦人每月只得五百元、（卽按每噸裝卸費二角提出百分之十計二分、連各項設備及一切管理費等均在内、）不知依何種算法、算得一千元及二千元之數、</p>
<h3>合作社之需索</h3>
<p>十八年五月所訂加價之辦法、另有一段歷史、未便發表、而局方所謂額外需索、則如三十噸車裝運棉花、照章應收二十噸裝卸費、而合作社硬照三十噸收取、樹柴裝車原與普通貨物相同、而合作社勒索加倍之費、卽就揀包費一層説、在加價力辦法中規定、雜　生仁揀包籌噸加洋一角二分、而合作社則遇有兩商家合併裝載一車、不論合裝的貨、各有多少、譬如一輛四十噸車、甲商裝三十五噸、乙商裝五噸、而合作社一律强收四十噸揀包費、此外尙有所謂加違費加伕費等各種名目、此種事實、自有直接感受苦痛之商人爲證、</p>
<h3>撤銷該社原因</h3>
<p>本局此次根據合作社試辦章程第二十六條『該社倘不能遵照章程違犯規則時、本局隨時將該社撤銷、另招工人裝卸、現在合作社種種不法、旣如上述、則本局取銷該社、自是正當辦法、至所稱評議會議照該項試辦合作社章程第二十八條原文一爲改善工人生活、解除工人糾紛、及求裝卸之敏捷穩妥方法起見、遇必要時、得設評議會、由站長警務段長總領班及繳納裝卸費最多之轉運公司兩家、各出代表一人組織之、評議會之會議、由站長召集之、</p>
<p>顯然與第二十六條之規定、不能併爲一談、</p>
<h3>工人生活估計</h3>
<p>按裝卸工人能力、每日裝卸貨物二十噸、極爲從容、今假定以第日裝卸十噸計算、每噸實得裝卸費一角八分、每日可得一元八角、現在裝卸人在合作社之下、每噸實得資只得一角一分零、卽以一角三分論、每日祇可得一元在角、是裝卸人於承辦裝卸貨物制下、每日可多得半元、最後該局負責人、又謂本局惟一目標、爲解除商人苦痛、藉以增進貨運、同時卽所以顧全工人生活、現在硬説此承辦裝卸貨物辦法、爲包工制、是非曲直、只能聽候中央解决云、</p>
<p>兩路營業鋭减後</p>
<h3>力謀吸收客貨運輸</h3>
<p>變更方式力求便利客商</p>
<p>廣事招徠以冀挽救現狀</p>
<p>京滬滬杭甬兩路管理局長黃伯樵、鑒於兩路客貨營業鋭减、重要原因、雖在各業不景氣農村經濟衰落、經詳加研究、力謀挽救、决更改營業方式、廣事招徠、竭力吸收客運貨運、並擬辦法三項、飭兩路員工、共同研究實行、（一）澈底調查可以與鐵路競爭營業之交通事業、將其路線時間、價目及營業狀况、充分明瞭、然後就其可以辦理聯運者、接洽聯運、其與鐵路所定價目等、比較不相當者、量予更正、（二）澈底調查沿線大宗出產貨品及輸入貨品、將其種類·數量·價値·以及銷路來源、與夫每年主要運銷時節、充分明瞭、然後隨地隨時與各客商接洽承運、客商所希望條件、儘可能範圍内、予以接受、更須不待客商表示、先已將一切障礙排除、（三）澈底調查沿線名勝等可以遊息之處、與地方合作、造成可以吸收遊客之環境、並予遊客以種種便利、此外如調度車輛·安排·貨棧等、本身先須有充分之準備、否則有充分之客貨、而本身之設備或支配不足供其需求、必致喪失信用、而訓練工作員工、使各澈底明瞭本身責任之所在、一致從自動的營業一個方向進行、尤爲重要、</p>

<h3>太古工潮昨訊</h3>
<p>太古公司之廣東罷工風潮、因雙方尙無接近之表示、故形勢益見嚴重、昨日消息如下</p>
<h3>汕頭形勢嚴重</h3>
<p>廣東海員分會、向太古提出要求工友復職條件、迄未接受、而公司爲進一步的表示、自動將廣東貨客停載、並將南華班輪止赴廣州、在工潮未解决前、决將廣州航路放棄、粤海員分會、遂向汕頭方面活動亦要求一致加入罷工、因太古在汕頭行馳之船、較廣東爲多、除滬港綫内十一船外、尙有新加坡班·盤谷班·等六船現在汕頭已有罷工之説雖尙未實現、而形勢則極爲嚴重、</p>
<h3>客貨電告止運</h3>
<p>汕頭客帮、刻己發電來滬、請滬上各汕帮、將貨物暫時減運、並勿載太古船以防意外、太古公司於汕頭一埠、尙派輪行、但已無貨客載往矣、</p>
<h3>四輪放回上海</h3>
<p>山東濟南金華新疆等四輪於廣州罷工之後、以船内運粤貨件、不能起卸、遂商得海員分會同意、准各輪開還上海、將船内之貨、轉換他公司輪運粤、昨日、山東新疆已先回滬、當在華通碼頭抛泊、濟南等今日亦可至滬、各該輪中之海員與中艙部工友、仍各隨船服務來滬、蓋目前之罷工、最有力者爲碼頭工人駁運工人也、</p>
<h3>客商已受影響</h3>
<p>太古公司在南華一路、勢力最大、行上海廣東者、有山東·蘇州·新寗·新疆·綏陽·四川·太原·濟南·慶元·瓊州·廣東·及安徽·等十二船、每星期須開五班、平日廣帮貨裝其船者最多、此次粤省罷工停止裝卸貨物、致客家預訂合同裝運之貨、悉遭阻停、聞僅水菓一業因被阻而須損失二十餘萬元、其他各貨之受罷工阻滯者、此一旬中、亦蒙重大損失、據粤帮估計、因太古輸罷工後之各帮受直接間接的損失、至今至少達七八十萬元矣、</p>
<h3>公司態度一斑</h3>
<p>太古公司、對於此次罷工問題、在表面上表示不願與粤海員分开討論條件、萬一汕頭亦如廣州、情願不派輪行、其理由以改革制度、不應發生罷工爲由、但以連日各地運往粤汕客貨幾全部停頓、紛載招商怡和船往、損失亦甚重大、故暗中進行、向有力分子接洽、希望轉圜、但所派赴粤之稽查史德林、非爲工潮事而往、乃爲棧房問題、與罷工絶無關涉也、</p>

<h3>發掘劉氏古墳</h3>
<p>五百年前女屍完好</p>
<p>巨大石穴古代衣冠</p>
<p>本埠小北門内萬竹街一百號、係明代古墓後裔劉姓、於昨晨僱工發掘、擬將所葬棺柩遷葬鄉間、開挖之時、發現五百年之古屍一具、完好如故、並掘得磁玉翠金等物、茲將　查經過情形、摘誌於後、</p>
<h3>僱工發掘</h3>
<p>萬竹街龔惠記木行隔壁、係一劉姓古墓、朝南出向、並有翁仲、（即石人、）四週圍有竹籬、門牌爲一百號故主劉姓、昨晨僱小工數十人發掘墳墓、正中主穴、發現一巨大石穴、掘開之後、另有巨木套材、中間係一赭色香楠木棺柩、稍有損壞、</p>
<h3>屍不變色</h3>
<p>打開該棺、見一女屍年紀已邁面不變色、屍身所穿爲一品朝服珠冠蟒袍、紅裙緞靴、屍額之上、紮有黃緞、中間一塊白玉、並覓得翠玉赤金首飾數件、在屍頭之旁、置有磁碗一對、滿裝白飯兩碗、惟微風一吹、陽光射入之後、屍身遂變成黑色、</p>
<h3>明代成化</h3>
<p>石穴之上、刋有明季成化十七年等字樣、查明代成化迄今、將近五百年、而乃屍身完好如故、故主原擬檢骨埋葬、現今發見屍體完好、祗得購置黑漆棺木一口、將該婦屍體、重行成殮、</p>
<h3>楠木淸香</h3>
<p>昨午記者親至該處察看、目見小工數十人、仍在該處發掘、並備有骨箱十餘具、及黑漆板木一具、（即成殮女屍之用）而香楠木之壞材、已有旁人拾得、用火焚燒時、異常淸香、各工人等將所葬棺柩、分别檢骨、裝成骨箱、然後運往鄉間埋葬</p>
<h3>傳説種種</h3>
<p>惟發掘墳墓之説有二種、一爲劉姓現將墳地脱售、得地價六萬金、必將所葬棺柩遷葬之後、方能交地得主管業、一説劉姓後裔、因該處市面將興擬自建市房、故即僱工發掘、將所葬棺柩、完全遷地埋葬</p>
<h3>黑水金魚</h3>
<p>又訊、九畝地明代顯宦劉姓墳墓一所、共有墓地十八畝许、墓前翁仲外、尙有石馬等物、該墓由畫錦牌樓邑人劉石溪·承糧執管、遜淸時該墓地陸續出賣、至現今祗剩墳基一畝八分餘、惟墓前兩翁仲仍在、較曩時則已移進、半身入於泥土、據諗知該墳來歷者云、遜淸該墓地割賣時、有居住南翔之劉姓出而阻止、向劉石溪交涉、謂此墓係其祖墓、尙有一墓、在龍華向託看墳之阿毛、代爲完糧、并提出家譜爲證、但管業單串、均在劉石溪處、後經調停、彼此劉姓、同爲祖先、作爲共有、近因居住南翔之劉姓因營業失敗、商允劉石溪家、將該墓出賣於某公司、前昨兩日、由劉姓督同小工發掘檢骨之際、詎料該墓建築堅固、不易破毁、該墓一棺一穴、共有二十餘穴、主昭穆之雙穴尙未發掘、其餘大都掘動、石廓之外、上蓋獨塊石板、坑内棺木、十九不爛、形似梓樹棺木、昨日午前掘發一女棺、不料坑内有黑色之水、且有金魚、尙游弋、即由劉姓督工者盛於面盆移去、嗣將女棺開啓、則棺内女屍、絶未腐爛、面目如生、左手指上有三戒指、右手握十二生肖、亦係鳳冠霞佩、風亦不化灰、督工之劉姓、因見全不腐爛、小骨箱未能盛殮、故即往附近購得黑色棺木一具、重行殮入、（該棺現尙在墓地）此外皆以白木骨箱檢骨、該墓墓碑、祇有主穴前一塊、碑上字跡己剝蝕糢糊、其尙可見者爲『勅建』『榮應』、明成化二十三年、道光二年等字、半截尙在泥土地中、不易窺全豹、據附近老者云、謂係明代劉伯溫家族、姑誌之、</p>

<p>讀者顧問</p>
<h3>我的讀書問題</h3>
<p>丨桐城姚春女士來信丨</p>
<p>當每天報紙來的時候，我總是先把讀者顧問</p>
<p>欄閲讀一過，才及其他的新聞；於此，可以想見我對於貴欄的崇仰心了！</p>
<p>現在我有一椿疑難的事，深使我徬徨和躊躇！在未上正題之先，且容我把的經歷略説一説：</p>
<p>當我出世後的第四年上，我慈愛的母親便棄我而去了！我的父親娶了一位妾，同在外面過那飄泊的生涯，因爲不常回家的原故、無人督促的我、在某女學高小還沒有畢業便輟學；</p>
<p>後來又在某畫師處習了三年的國畫，可恨我天資太魯鈍！三年的光陰，竟憑空處擲，一點成續也沒有！</p>
<p>到十八歲上出嫁了，夫家的人口是很多的，是一個大家庭制度，賴着先人的餘蔭，總算還有一碗飯吃；丈夫是一個略識之無的人，生成的一副少爺脾氣，終日游手好閒，惟以呼盧喝雉爲能事；我百般的規勸，均屬無效，且因此傷了雙方的感情！</p>
<p>我家受了農村經濟破產的影響，加之家中人　的不事生產，連年營業的失敗、漸己陷入不支狀態、甚而至於生活也鬧恐慌！</p>
<p>結婚的七年之中，連生了一子二女，一切的擔負，更屬不了！我在前年的春季託人謀得某小學的科任敎員，薪金每月十餘元，在生活程度較低的内地，還可以勉强敷衍，支配各項用度之下，一些餘積都沒有！但是丨丨將來子女的敎育基金，和我設若脱事後的用度，又出在那裏呢？丨丨我因爲幼年時的失學，所以智勵及學問都很幼稚，以現在失業的呼聲遍佈國中之時，我再去找其他的職業，可就難能登天了！</p>
<p>我因爲對於社會應用的學　尙付缺如、所以我仍想繼續再去求學，但丨幾個疑難的問題，又横梗在我的心頭，睿智的先生們！能否給與我一個明白的指導呢？</p>
<p>現在我因經濟的　困，對於學費一層，當然要設法籌措；幸虧潯江有位月友，她家產尙豐，她因憐憫我的境遇，慨然肯擔負我一切，但她也要我和她同在某女校裏讀書據説那個學校完全是一個婦女學校、是因失學的婦女而設的、程度並不深，係敎會所立，高中畢業後，才可出而任事，但是年限太久了，並且離家也　遠，這使我深爲躊躇　一。</p>
<p>假使我入學之後，小孩的安排，以及小孩等的一切用度，又將如何支配呢？雖然小孩們可以托給家中人照顧，而擔負一切的用費，其將誰屬呢？這也使我躊躇者二。</p>
<p>浮雲般的時世，變幻莫測，贛西的紅軍這樣地猖獗，設若一旦蔓延至潯，那公學校就要受着影響了！豈不是半途而廢，到那時兩地懸空，進退維谷，又將如何處置呢？此使我深慮者三。</p>
<p>我的讀書問題，有以上的三端，要請先生們加以磋商和指示，這是我最昐望的！</p>
<p>答：一個人處在進退維谷的時候，只有『不顧一切』，『抛却一切』，把自己從舊社會，舊家庭拯救出來，不然的話，這邊看看，捨不得兒女，那邊看看，又捨不得丈夫，那你只有終於陷在那苦悶的人生泥淖中，永遠不能自拔。依我們看來，女士旣和你的丈夫不相得，小孩子也儘可由夫家去照管，抽開身子自己求學。倒楣的生育問題，家庭問題，不曉得害了多少中國靑年男女！只有决心抛棄一切，才有辦法。</p>
<p>某女士旣願助你讀書，又願和你同學，自然是個難得的機會，若果因此能以得到相當的學識，時間久點又何妨呢？不過經騐告訴我們，敎會的學校也不見得學得着什麽眞正有用的科學，你要讀書，儘可向某女士借個幾十塊錢，買一批有用的書籍，自己自修，倒還實際。我看你的文字，很是通順，不是沒有門路的。</p>
<p>至於女士所躊躇的第二個問題，除了我們前面所説的『不顧一切』一個辦法外、再沒有其他萬全之策。第三條所躊躇的，到也不錯，然而果如女士所料。囗囗軍『蔓延至潯』，我想學校不會受到若何影響，至少學總歸由你求的，這却不必過於憂慮。</p>

<h3>荔支佳話</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>綘羅　　　仙姝，肌膚如雪瑩　瑜；我欲綠章乞靑帝，佳　移植來東吳；洞庭楊梅堪娣姒，堆盤火　交珊瑚。</p>
<p>這是郁靑門先生『南食行中的名句。一南食行』是羅列嶺南的種種食品，這幾句，是專説荔支的，雖沒有説破，却己神在阿堵中，恰和東坡詩中的『　山仙人綘羅襦』，同樣的可作爲荔支之謎。</p>
<p>邵靑門和王阮亭很爲莫逆，邵是山人，王是名臣；王阮亭奉旨祭南海時，郡守郊迎，縣令負怒先驅，可謂『吁嗟闊兮』。但，美中不足，他到嶺南時，荔支還沒有成熟。邵靑門到嶺南時，琴劍　零，飽受世人白眼。但，有一事差强人意，恰値荔支成熟，儘可大嚼不休。所以，靑門寄阮亭詩，有云：『我來正値荔支天，虬珠堆瑪瑙　；淸泉初浴絳襦皺，蘭香微擘冰肌寒；　　甜雪融無滓，瓊乳霞液爭芳鮮；方紅江綠誰比數，钗頭丁香亦可憐；飽噉半月變髮，衰容看鏡朱顏！題詩遠寄華不注，想見先生掀髯捧腹吻流涎。』靑門這首詩，分明要去吸引阮亭的　涎。毛稚黃戲評云：『淸泉四語，爲荔支寫照，色聲香味俱足，令我朶頤。』許語也評的有趣。</p>
<p>荔支有『掛絲』一種，產於增城，前淸時官廳封作私物，實爲無上佳品，可惜現在己絶種了！東東莞的『公　孫』，鶴山的『桂味』，南海的『妃子笑都是荔支中的珍品，可惜產量不多。『一騎紅　妃子笑』，誰都要羨慕楊妃的口福；其實，嶺南的荔支，貢入陜西，無論怎樣的　　飛遞，畢竟已失了眞味。最可口的荔支，莫佳於早晨摘下的鮮果。零露湛湛中的荔支，隨采隨吃，甘香直沁肺腑，倘非生長粤地，萬難領略此佳味；楊妃有知，定當在馬　驛下。垂涎不己。</p>
<h3>討飯三年官不做</h3>
<p>— 思素</p>
<p>最貴者莫如官，最賤者莫如丐；古之所謂士子，今之所謂學生，他們的最大目的，都是想做官。做了官窮的自然會變成富，嬌妻美妾，僕御婢僮，以及洋房汽車，無不隨心所欲，一齊向日的幻想成爲事實。丐則最賤，誰願意去做，然而俗諺又有『討飯三年官不做』這句話，豈非大奇，丐非至愚，何至因爲討丁三年飯，有官都不去做呢？</p>
<p>天下事也眞是難説，别看輕了丐，丐也確有其可做的滋味呢，蹲在馬路旁邊，涕泗交流，滿口少奶奶小姐，無把握能在某一少奶奶小姐討得一個銅板的丐，自然沒有做頭。須知丐界也有高踞寳座，儼然發號施令。及其儼然設官分職，和兼圻封疆的部屬，要他去做官，只怕是不願的。上海就是這樣。報紙也曾有過記載，且不必多説。我現在還發現到一種特别的丐類，在不知道上海有上述那一種丐的看了，更要驚奇不置。這一類丐發現於浦東，有妻有子，完全與常人家庭一樣；住的房子也和常人無異，出錢租賃的。浦東本是貧民窟，不規則的草房多，他們和正當勞力的人雜居着，一點看不出是丐，連左右鄰居也不易察破。他們早晨起來，全家動員，渡浦　西，到下午歸家，炊飯果腹，這和正當勞力者又差不多。所異的，就是他們一到浦西，即分頭求乞，而非正當勞動。還是有人在浦東認識他們而巧遇於浦西求乞時，纔曉得他們是以乞丐爲業。據説他們也防備遇見熟人，總是到遠一點的地方求乞去，像這樣的丐，誰又説他們不是『樂爲之』的呢！</p>
<h3>蒼蠅的神通</h3>
<p>— 紮震</p>
<p>早被稱爲擾害人類大惡魔的蒼蠅，現在又在飛揚跋扈的大肆騷擾了！關乎它們怎樣的在做疾病轉運公司的經理？我們對付它們的手段又是應當怎樣？這都非本文所欲叙述的；我現在只將它們所特具的幾項神通而爲大衆所不及詳知的表揚一下，以當介紹。</p>
<p>吻丨它的口吻，是一個管狀，中又分無數細管如篩形。其吻甚長，休息時即隱藏於頭之下部。吻端覆有兩個圖卵形突起物，極易粘帶物。每逢吻口接觸液體時，咽頭上即生吮吸作用，將物質吸入口腔，經頸部達於胸腹，若食物爲固體時，則分泌唾液溶解之，以膏彼　吻。而且趨羶附臭，到處可做一個不速之客，又可以從桌上吃到桌下，眞可謂天生的一張會吃白食的嘴了。</p>
<p>怪眼丨它的頭爲球形，上有觸鬚一對，鬚側有複眼二，由數千單眼所集成，佔據頭之大部分，在頭頂部又有單眼三個，位列如品字形，兩複眼之間，有一隔道，雄者呈黑色甚狹，雌者呈褐色稍寛因其眼部之特别搆造，及頭之轉動靈便，故其視力範圍頗廣。即或背後有大敵猝至，亦常可望風而逃，甚得其怪眼的力不小。</p>
<p>隨從丨它得頭上身上脚上都携帶有很多的細菌，這是大家都知道的：但是它究竟携帶有多少呢？據某科學家得調查：其肢體上所附着之細菌數，大約由五百五十萬至六百六十萬。它帶領着這許多隨從兵，隨時去騷害人家，也無怪乎常會鬧得天翻地覆了！</p>
<p>生殖丨它在適宜的環境内，一個熱季中可以繁殖九代，統計其共有的子孫數，則其數字約爲五又二十九個零。其生殖力之大，眞可使人咋舌。求子的人，若要去禱神拜佛，倒不如趕快的去修建一座『蒼蠅娘娘』的廟。娘娘有靈，我包管它也立時可以保佑你會養出許多一白二胖的兒子來使你十分歡喜的。呵呵！蒼蠅的神通有如此，我們看了且將作何感想？</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十回　聞語警芳心封侯願渺</p>
<p>聽歌現羨色報國身閑</p>
<p>他心裏想着，一走進大門，必定就可以遇到桂枝的。可是事與願違，楊家靜掩了屋外的風門，一點聲息也沒有。自己回家來。唯一的理由是探望父親的。當然繼續的向裏院裏走。趙翁在裏面屋子裏看到，就問道：這個時候，你還回來作什麽，還不快回營去？趙自强道：沒有什麽事吩咐我嗎？趙翁道：我沒有什麽事，你去罷。趙自强見父親催得這樣緊，只得不進屋，轉身向外走。可是他走的時候，那脚下的皮鞋。走得呱呱作響，幾乎是前後院子裏都聽到了。果然，他這樣走法，很有些效騐，當他走到前院的時候，桂枝却把窗子中間，一方小玻璃糊上的活紙片，掀了起來，在玻璃裏面，露出了一張白臉。趙自强自然也是回頭向這裏看看，正好兩個人打了一個照面。在那一刹那之間，趙連長是不便突然的駐足而觀，可是老姑娘的臉上，泛起兩朶紅雲，己經把那張白臉縮回玻璃窗子裏去了。桂枝這樣一縮，把一個　在坑上的江氏，却大大的吃了一驚，坐起來問道：什麽事？桂枝道：沒什麽事。江氏道：院子裏是誰來了？桂枝沒有答覆，走向小桌子邊去倒茶喝。江氏道“你聽見沒有，我問你是誰在外面。桂枝道：沒關係，是人家走過去。江氏聽了這話，却不免噗嗤一笑。原來自己的姑娘。都呌趙自强做趙連長。自婚姻問題正式發生而後。他絶口就不提趙連長三個字。這次逼得他不能不説了，不好意思呌『他』，也不好意思呌『趙連長』，却折衷兩可的呌『人家』，這倒難爲自己姑娘。一時怎樣想得出。江氏聽了院子裏的皮鞋聲。本也就一半的想着，無非是那四個連長。現在姑娘説是人家，這就一針剌一個血眼，知道决計是趙連長的了。心裏佩服姑娘辨才之餘，所以就噗嗤笑了（一一二）</p>
<h3>荳棚瓜架</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>大麥是收割了！菜類也過時了丨現在鄉下是種些甚麽呢？一楞楞的田裏，種着很齊整的毛豆。（即大豆）還有搭着整齊的竹架，上邊緣着瓜藤，王瓜絲瓜生瓜夜開花都有。豆棚瓜架，是鄉間現在唯一的好風景，斜陽影裏，站在田頭望望，倒也着實有趣。</p>
<p>在下雖是一個玩筆桿的朋友，却兼做了握鋤頭的老圃。一年來的經騐，着實有些小門檻。現在寫些出來貢獻給閲者（一）豆類　種豆是農作中最輕鬆的事不要日日澆水澆糞，只要隔幾天除去些雜草罷了。未下種之前，先把地上的雜草除盡，再把泥土鋤細，分作了畦楞。把荳種和了稻灰種下，不要擠得太緊，三株作成一簇，一簇相隔尺許。那末莖株不會拔長，荳實自然繁茂了。凡大荳赤荳綠荳，都是這樣子種的。花時有一種硬甲蟲，須要捉去，否則會咬去了花朶，不會結實。至於小靑蟲，它是菜類的老主顧，荳上倒不會去的。還有缸荳扁荳刀荳，種法是和上邊差不多。</p>
<p>（二）瓜類　這裏所種的瓜，是菜蔬用的王瓜絲瓜生瓜夜開花冬瓜南瓜一類。西瓜和黃金瓜是不種的，所以我也不説了。在立夏節左右，揀肥大不蛀的瓜子，在細肥的泥土中化秧，秧有二三寸長，然後一株株分種。把田鋤成闊約二尺的畦楞，兩旁用細竹搭成瓜架，高要有四五尺，相隔尺許種一株。到花開前澆肥料，還要不時的灌水。瓜類大都莖上有細毛，小靑蟲是不怕的，硬甲蟲是要捉去的。其中南瓜和冬瓜，可以直緣在地面，因爲搭了架子，載不住它的重量。</p>
<p>救國之聲</p>
<h3>救國標準之解釋</h3>
<p>— 繆篆</p>
<p>夫近日通稱『共赴國難』四字，依鄙人之愚解之，學界之赴國難也，大約不越習坎重險，君子常德行習敎事矣。黑智爾以講堂爲戰塲　巴斯脱以試騐室爲戰塲；似合『共赴』二字之原理。今當留心中國史理，當增刋救國報紙；當廣聞國外消息；當多　兒童讀物；如此講去，則士農工商，人人一舉一動，皆從本分上努力進取，在範圍内盡量活動，莫不有赴國難之精神，即抱在手中吃乳之小孩，乃二十年後之義務兵，亦須養成共赴國難之精神。且如此講去，則學校中無一學院，無一學系，無一學程，在在爲赴國難而設，然則認明『爲國難讀書，以讀書救難，』一校如此，全國學校如此，大學如此，中小學亦如此，昔法皇拿破侖戰勝奏凱而回，則歸功於小學敎師，夫小學敎師何嘗入義勇軍？何嘗去買飛機？然而拿破侖以爲『此乃共赴國難者！』如查此説能講得通也，則學界共赴國難之精神，乃在講堂及試騐室，而爲敎授者，如果無論何科何系都含有救國難的成分在其中，則學生當添出許多『爲國』</p>
<p>難讀書』的興味，此或是樹立救國標準之一端乎？尙祈達者批評之。</p>
<p>又近日通稱『長期抵抗』四字，依鄙人之愚解之，簡直是『無期抵抗』。無期云者，終身終世之謂也。國難如此嚴重，帝國主義者如此殘酷，能在預計期間粉飾太平乎？能在頭痛醫頭之後遂告休假乎？勢必有無期之操心，勢必有無期之慮患。夫德國在歐戰以後，國民的抵抗精神，則以科學極新道德極舊爲主旨。其窮困則瀕於绝境，而於敎育則學程較戰前提高，於衛生則死亡較戰前減少，吾師乎！吾師乎！我國人民當以德國戰後人民爲法，我國學界，當以德國戰後學界爲法，此亦救國標準中參考之資料也。</p>
<p>又近日通稱『喚起民衆』之口號依鄙人之愚解之，當有切實之要件：（一）普通識字，統一語言，尤其是黃河以南，必令民衆人人認識國音及羅馬字兩種注音符號，則精神上之喚起也；（二）森林，燃料，鹽漁，救荒，耕種，蠶織手藝，人人當圖進步改良，則物質上之喚起也。率民於勤，每人每日因國難加工作一小時，每日能發明國貨一兩件。率民於儉，每人每日因國難輸國家一　子，則每日能購飛機若干架。且『喚起民衆』，當先『喚起學者之自己。』</p>
<p>溯九一八之後，事關攘夷，學生舉動，　宜恊同，孤柱不若衆擎之易舉，元氣不離公論而獨存；人方刀俎，我爲魚肉，將來富强，惟年富力强之學生是望，將來道脈，惟學閭思辨之學生是傳。就人民論，譬如一家的人，一年半之中死去四個人，家中有時悲號，誰也不能厭其煩擾也。就土地論，譬如一家的屋，一年半之中燒去四間，專藏衣物珍寳的屋，家中有人報怨懊恨，誰也不能責其鄙陋也。惟全國新舊學者不火速樹立救國標準，則國未救而學己荒，學愈荒而國愈不可救，荒一日全國學生之光陰，其損失過於百千兆之戰費，且恐將來怪狀百出，不可思議，以微子箕子之聖而佯狂，以屈原宋玉之才而譫語，前淸昏政之末有以蹈海聞矣，某省會議之爭，有以尸諫聞矣；三軍之師，以機巧而可奪；匹夫之志，以金石而不移；防火患當曲其突，防水患當開其渠；此乃莫大之功德，不朽之事業也。伏願鴻學碩望，一擇狂愚之言，則幸甚幸甚！</p>

<p>１０－５一二兩組表演精彩俱獲全勝</p>
<p>得分表中中華會佔極對優勢</p>
<p>明日遇强敵日本内外紗廠</p>
<p>上海草地網球會聯合比賽、昨日中華網球會以十比五擊敗連勝冠軍三年之日本網球會、中華會從未染指之聯賽錦標、從此更有希望、比賽原定十星期三、以天雨延期、改於昨日補賽、遠道往體育會路參觀者甚衆、菲島明星茄維亞賽林旦亦　塲、中華會全體戰將皆出席、惟江道章未來、屠開元已自馬尼拉返、故陣勢稍有變動、一二兩組皆直落三得勝、惟三四兩組皆以一比二受挫、以致得分、不能如期望之深、殊爲美中不足、亦足見日本雙打人材之衆也、明日中華會對内外紗廠亦尙有一番大戰、昨日五組成續如下、</p>
<h3>老江缺席受影響</h3>
<p>昨日老將江道章之缺席、得分上大受影響、因之三四五三組實力俱减削、尤以四五兩組爲甚、否則江入第三組、可得全勝、四五亦必可多得一二分也、希望明日出席、一戰内外紗廠、</p>
<h3>鄭兆佳特殊賣力</h3>
<p>第一組林鄭對野口久重、最受人注意、亦最有精彩、鄭兆佳更特别出色、發球稍見進步、而其前衝之一記半空壓殺、速而有力、敵方爲束手、其網前攔殺、昨日全塲獨步、尙有對角之一長抽、準而且急、林賣華則平平而已、惟擊來則見其特殊小心、無絲毫苟且、</p>
<h3>第一組劇戰經過</h3>
<p>野口久重二人、雖無藉之名、但其雙打球藝、確尙可取、高球之穩、林鄭不如、第一盤中、常以極穩之高球、使林鄭不能近網、再而進至半塲、在半空施凶猛之壓殺、日方先開球、得勝一局、於是發球者皆勝、直至成四比四、林鄭擊敗日人發球之第九局、以五比四佔先、不意於第十局鄭兆佳發球時、林寳華二次在網前重殺於網中、成爲各五、後仍以七比五得勝、二三兩盤林鄭更人佳境、二盤全勝六局、三盤日人僅得一七兩局、</p>
<h3>第二組邱錢亦勝</h3>
<p>錢耀彬與邱飛海搭配、對方岡氏、爲雙打猛將、以錢可欺、初連連向耀彬一人進攻、但耀彬亦特别留意、其高球甚佳、老邱則不减本色、日人之敗、在於　殺觸網者不少、結果日人僅得二局六二一六○、六○、爲最先完塲之一組、</p>
<h3>第四組劇戰而敗</h3>
<p>梁德光余田光兩光搭配、合作尙佳、以六比一、四比六、六比二勝、第五組則以一比二失敗、一二三五組得分之合計、爲九比三、第四組在各組已完畢時、尙在苦戰各得一盤後、第三盤已　漸暮、孫麟方尙穩健、惜與屠之合作、須進步、屠　己露疲乏、平等數次、卒以八比十失第三盤</p>
<h3>明日戰内外紗廠</h3>
<p>明日中華會輪値與日本内外紗廠作戰、内外甚强、亦曾以十比五勝日本會、僅以七比人失一分、故各人仍須努力應付、陣綫尤須審愼、四五组實力須加重、如克内外、則無問題矣、明日球塲在海格路、或改至中華網球塲尙未定、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>關於古物</h3>
<p>— 鳳吾</p>
<p>周作人居士『藥廬尺牘』，對敎授將與古物一同南遷，深致遺憾，我看這是大可不必的。果眞能像古物一樣押送南來，不致被捺在北平城裏看飛機，受驚恐，在無路可走的小百姓看來，己經是夠羡慕的了。而猶曰『憾』，豈非怪事？</p>
<p>當今之世，除掉古物，可説很少有價値的東西。君不見，幾個月前上海報上載着某人騙了朋友的一尊小小的塑像，因爲是唐吳道子塑的，就可以賣一百萬元：而一個堂堂的有權威的博士，在交易所裏的估價，不過五千元而已。前人詩云：『不信死人勝活人』，現在是，活人死人都比不上古物。</p>
<p>古物是和人一樣，也有倒霉的時期，但這時期究竟不長。譬如幾年前吳稚暉老要擲向毛厠裏的線裝書罷，現在不但舊書店居爲奇貨，高抬市價，而且在政治上也大大的時髦起來。前幾天廣東固已發出讀經通令，而某方面也説敎材務必注重禮義廉恥·孝弟忠信即此一端，可以想見古書如日月經天，江河行地·雖有時不免爲浮雲所掩，究竟是偶然的事。其他古物，又何獨不然？和康聖人同住在一個花園裏的時候，常常看見他運書出去，原來他在三馬路開了一個舊書舖，運到那邊去賣。做牧師的友人某君，過去專喜收買古董，現在却是一爿古董店的老　了。我因此恍然大悟，古物不僅風雅，且有大利。這『利』當然包括着超經濟的利益，觀中央圖書館與商務訂的『四庫全書影印合同』，可以相信我的話不是無風生浪。</p>
<p>因爲古物的可寳貴，所以無論賢愚不肖，對此都有愛好。岳飛固然寫得一手好字，而且寫了一部集子，就是和他對立，現在跪在他墓旁的秦檜，也是一個古物的愛好者。據明李日華『味水軒日記』所載，萬歷三十七年己酉十一月十三日，他就看到一幅字、上面『有『檜』字一方印，又『秦氏藏書』一印』。所以，愛古物的人，不一定是賢者，而賢者也不一定有古物。</p>
<p>想到了古物，不由得想起中國空虚的國庫來。我覺得要把古物也徵起捐來，不是可以收入一批很大的欵項麽？糞捐起風潮，傳單徵收手續費，商民們高喊『取消傳單手續費，以恤商艱』，（申報二十一日南京電）古物收捐，總該不致於有什麽反響罷。敢以此議，獻之有司。</p>
<h3>暴風雨後的黃昏</h3>
<p>— 謝冰瑩</p>
<p>是暴風雨過後的黃昏，我來到洪水滔滔的江邊了。</p>
<p>兩星期來不斷的下雨，江水巳漲齊了隄岸，距離新搭成的橋梁只有兩尺高了。滾滾的波濤有如千兵萬馬在奔馳。江水雖然呈着淡黃的濁色，但雪花似的白浪，是多麽雄壯而美麗喲！</p>
<p>在河岸的石級上坐着兩個中年婦女在洗衣，她們是過慣了這種波浪生活的人，雖然浪花濺滿了一身，更打濕了她們那十八世紀的木底高跟鞋，可是她一點也不慌張，也不顧惜，只是沉着地洗着衣服，一聲聲有節拍的擣衣聲與洪大的波濤聲共奏着初夏的黃昏之曲。從橋的那邊走來了一個持竿背笠的漁翁，看他得意的表情，像是有了相當收穫。三五成羣的歸自田間的農夫和挑着担子自城市趕回鄉村的男女苦力們唱着小調，愉快地悠閒地走過這座兩天以前被大水冲斷過的板橋。</p>
<p>幾塊木排，載着一大羣鷺絲，一個年約十三四歲的孩子撑着牠，勇敢地在波濤中前進。</p>
<p>一隻小鷄𠼫來了一隻小小的靑蛙正想�</p>
<p>放下吃的當兒，不料被另一只看到了，連忙跑來從牠嘴裏奪了去，第三只看到了，又從第二只嘴裏奪過去，第一只又搶了回來，第三第四又忙趕過來，這樣搶得一塌糊塗，小靑蛙還是沒有被呑入誰的肚裏。</p>
<p>『呵，這是生存的鬥爭呢？還是象徵中國軍閥的搶地盤？』</p>
<p>正在第二批小鷄戰士加入戰鬥的開始當中，一只大雄鷄來了，牠咯咯地呌了一聲，就毫不客氣地𠼫走了靑蛙。�</p>
<p>大鷄小鷄的主人出來了，這是一位滿頭白髮，三寸金蓮的老太婆，她張開兩手趕着鷄回籠子裏去，於是那只做爲鬥爭犧牲品的靑蛙，被棄在道上任人踐踏了。斜陽漸漸地西沉，晚風在開始工作，江流的聲音由洪大變爲尖鋭了，凉風掠過我的頭髮，也吹透了我的心懷，對着正在散下黑幕的天空，望着渺渺茫茫的雲山，我吁了一口長氣丨</p>
<p>呵，該是歸去的時候了丨</p>
<h3>再論鑼鼓</h3>
<p>— 何如</p>
<p>頃見羅復先生舊劇鑼鼓新解，旣己領敎其矜爲獨得之新解矣。其中有涉及予之前論者、略爲申論，以見予於羅復先生之所疑，未嘗不早慮及也。</p>
<p>新解謂『角　百戲何時纔和中國戲劇水乳交』</p>
<p>融，鑼鼓何時纔正式闌人我國舊戲裏來，何如先生却又不免將這些問題輕易放過了。』宜若羅復先生不至輕放此一問題，别有新解者、但細看下文，不禁失望。蓋彼僅引顧起元客座贅語之老語爲證。其實顧氏此論，予曩嘗用以證南北曲之消長；（見最近靑年界）而不用以論鑼鼓者，以其所謂散樂，類於今之所謂淸唱，自無須乎鑼鼓。其所謂大席打院本，當係正式上演矣，然止言及撮墊圈，舞觀音，或百丈旗，或跌隊子，不及音樂，非無音樂也，故不能證北曲但有武把子而無鑼鼓也。何况北曲久己沒落，文獻難微，非起金元人於地下，未易有令人心服之證明乎？至顧氏論及南唱，未知言其所謂小集散樂歟？抑所謂大席打院本歟？其舉樂器不及鑼鼓，或僅言淸唱，故不用鑼鼓，或僅言主樂，其他未盡列舉，均未可知也。且崑曲雖謂成爲廣陵散，猶非完全絶響，間有知音者。例如『新舊戲曲之研究』著者佟賦敏先生、於論崑曲組織及表演法、謂其『樂隊方面，導歌樂以笛子嗩呐爲主，又由單皮及夾板指導他們。輔助笛子的有絃子，琵琶，笙，月琴，九音鑼，懷鼓。輔助嗩呐的有堂鼓，大鼓，小鑼，大鈸，小鈸，齊鈸，海笛。』又於崑曲改造論，謂『崑曲的原素旣然有蕭殺的軍樂，軍樂的燥煩是不宜於愛好和平民族的，就應該分析出來。所以鐃，鈸，索呐，大鑼等一槪不用，必須代以他種樂器。』崑曲用鑼鼓之説，非子嚮壁虚造也。何况李笠翁嘗親見崑曲之存在、己有鑼鼓忌雜之評乎？羅復先生謂『南曲最初不用鑼鼓，』此誠所謂新解矣，其奈顧起元之老話，原意糢糊，不足爲證何？至謂一笠翁此論發於崑曲沒落之際』爲予論最大之漏點，予誠不知其漏點何在也？</p>
<p>羅復先生旣自承認『中國戲劇遠源出自角觝，是中國戲劇史的三字經。我國舊戲不廢武把子與鑼鼓，是由於角觝武術須有　鼓以示進退，而壯　容，也自是不易之論。於予前論之基點所在，幸已看明，可勿　論。至謂『何如先生旣承認鼓是和武把子同時侵入舊戲，爲</p>
<p>什麽又斷言中國戲須用鑼鼓，是自有戲劇一物即不離鑼鼓，而不察知牠的　來，和牠也正和武把子一樣是在舊戲裏面牽强活動呢？此則須分别言之。子所謂中國戲須用鑼鼓者、係擬梅博士答蕭翁之言，蓋戲言耳，非爲鑼鼓辯護其存在者，覆按子論可知也。又予並無一鑼鼓是和武把子同時侵入舊戲』之言，不僅在前論中未嘗有此荒謬，今亦未便承認，敬以璧還。予但言『自有戲劇一物，即不離鑼鼓。』此亦根據舊説，人所盡知之三字經，顧未敢標爲新解也。</p>
<p>舊唐書卷二十九，音樂志二，首言散樂角觝百戲，次及當時之歌舞戲，有大面，撥頭，踏搖娘，　壘子等戲。大面一云代面。同書云：『代面出於北齊，北齊蘭陵王長恭，才武而面美，常著假面以對敵。嘗擊周師金墉城下，勇冠三軍，齊人壯之，爲此舞以效其指　剌擊之容，謂之蘭陵王人陣曲。王國維先生於宋元戲曲史論之曰：『古之俳　，但以歌舞及戲謔爲　。自漢以後，則間演故事。而合歌舞以演一事者、實始於北齊。顧其事至簡，與其謂之戲，不若謂之舞之爲當也。然後世戲劇之源，實自此始。』可知中國樂戲最初之形成，始於北齊以至唐朝代面一類之歌舞劇。代面一曲，演者旣著假面，己具臉譜之　形矣；旣效戰鬥時指麾剌擊之容，己類今之所謂武把子矣。所可惜者，史不書其歌舞時所伴奏之樂器。意者其亦用金鼓以示進退而壯陣容，確效古之戰爭乎？予所謂中國自有戲劇，卽不離鑼鼓與武把子，角觝百戲而外，此亦予説之一助。但仍不敢標爲新解，自矜創獲也。</p>
<p>最後有須鄭重申言者，予非爲鑼鼓武把子辯護，但盡測其歷史來源而己。原爲玩物喪志，姑作無聊之文，不謂引出羅復先生如許新解，抛甎引玉，獲賞己多，故喜而爲此再論。至予一論再論，無甚新解，謬佔自由談寳貴之篇幅，虚耗讀者寳貴之光陰，是則至爲惶恐不安，而無可如何者也。</p>
<h3>紅蘿蔔鬚</h3>
<p>— ＪｕｌｅｓＲｅｎａｒｄ作林取譯</p>
<p>末了的話（續）</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚知道雷辟克選下了這個方法來邀他。他也站起身，像平常一樣，把椅子拿去　壁放着，服服貼貼地跟隨着他父親。</p>
<p>起初，他們一言不發地走着。那不可避免的問題並沒有立刻發出來。紅蘿蔔鬚心裏在猜着那問題，并且籌劃怎樣回答。他己準備好了。他心裏曾經很厲害的搖動過，什麽都不懊悔。日中他旣有過那樣的感動，他現在可不害怕有更厲害的到來。况且終於决定開口了的雷辟克的語聲也使他安了心。</p>
<p>雷辟克丨你爲什麽還不把你剛才使得母親難受的那種行爲解釋給我聽呢？</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚丨我親愛的爸爸，我己躊躇好久，但我終於忍不下去了。我可以告白這事：我再不歡喜媽媽了。</p>
<p>雷辟克丨啊！爲什麽緣故呢？從什麽時候起的？</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚丨爲着一切的緣故。從我認識她的時候起。</p>
<p>雷辟克丨丨啊！這眞不幸啦，我的孩子！至少把她待你不好的地方講給我聽罷。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚丨丨這是一時講不完的。並且，你難道一點沒有看出來嗎？</p>
<p>雷辟克丨丨有的。我常常看見你在生氣。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚丨丨我聽到别人説我生氣便忍不住要更加憤怒。自然啦，紅蘿蔔鬚是不能認眞記恨的。他生氣。讓他去生氣罷。等到他氣醒了。他便會安安靜靜，消去怒容，出現在大家面前。最要緊的是不要現出關心他的樣子。這是沒有什麽要緊的。請你原諒，爸爸，這祗對於那些父親，母親，和不相干的人是沒有什麽要緊的。我有時生氣，從外表看來，這事我承認，可是我我可以向你斷言，有時我也會以整個的心非常厲害地發怒着，我再也不會忘記我所受的恥辱。</p>
<p>雷辟克丨丨會的，會的，你會忘記這些惡作劇的。紅蘿蔔鬚丨丨不然，不然。你在家裏的時候那樣少，你不知道所有的事情。</p>
<p>雷辟克丨丨我是不能不在外面奔走的。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚（現着滿足的樣子）丨丨事業當然是要緊的。爸爸。你埋頭於你的事業，無睱旁顧，至於媽媽呢，很恰當的説，她是除我以外沒有第二隻狗可以鞭打的。我不顧反這責任推在你身上。當然啦，我祇要鬼鬼崇崇一點就行，你會保護我的。你旣然問我，我以後可以慢慢地把過去的事情全部告訴你。你那時便會知道我是不是有着很好的記憶力。可是，現在，爸爸，我請你趕快給我一個主意。我要和我的母親離開。據你看來，最簡單的方法是什麽？</p>
<p>雷辟克丨丨你一年裏面。不過在暑假期中看見她兩個月罷了。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚丨丨你該許我留在學校裏面暑假的。我在那裏可以得着進步。</p>
<p>雷辟克丨丨在學校過暑假，這是留給貧窮子弟的一種恩惠。人家會爲我把你丢了。並且你不要祗想着你自己呢。還有我，你不在家會使我感着缺憾的　。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚丨你可以來看我的，爸爸。</p>
<p>雷辟克丨丨這種尋開心的散步要花狠多的錢呢，紅蘿蔔鬚。紅蘿蔔鬚丨那麽你可趁着有事必得出門時，繞個小圈子來看我一下。</p>
<p>雷辟克丨不。到現在爲止，我待你和待你的哥哥姐姐一樣，我留心着不使任何人享到特殊利益。我以後還得這樣幹下去。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚丨那麽，讓我廢學好了。祗説我偷了你的錢，把我從學校裏面拉出來，我可以去選擇一種手藝。（未完）</p>

<h3>標粉交旺價亦堅</h3>
<p>昨粉市上午開盤後、各月份初平繼稱、洋麥報價又漲五角至七八角左右、初以買氣不暢、兼天時良好、人心不免皇惑、入後因業外買戶出手動辦、并因國外殺價、有提高趨勢、因此人心甚穩、步入佳境、迨至下午開盤、人心又見飛躍、以上午標麥之激漲、似乎前途已有轉機、因此開價卽好、較上午又漲一分外、卽交易亦異常暢盛、旋因大廠均有脱手、數亦甚巨、遂見回抑、惟至五盤以後、因買戶又湧、市氣復佳、觀前逾形勢、粉銷一旺、當看好面、否則廠抛不絶、雖免仍受高壓、結果本月份較前遇好一分七厘半、七月份漲二分七厘七半、八月份漲二分二厘半、九月份漲二分七厘半、十月份漲三分、十一月份漲二分、</p>

<p>後即步步上升、空頭之抵補、亦見大暢、較前週</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>談睡眠</h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>吃了睡，睡了又吃，終日無所事，像這樣的人，大槪是沒有多大出息的，不免要被人駡爲廢物。然而人總是要睡覺的，官大爺要睡，小百姓也要睡，大富豪要睡，窮光蛋非睡不可。所差的祇是名種人有各種睡覺的不同。</p>
<p>平庸老百姓的睡覺多半都很簡單的。大淸早起來，一直忙到晚上，爲的是吃飯穿衣，就連睡覺也在内：當然是疲乏得很，祗要一躺下，便覺得十分舒服，一條松木板櫈也是頂好的床舖。然而這等人總還算在命裏註定了有一條板櫈的家業。一條板櫈也要値一二隻大龍洋，賺到手頗不容易。所以比較起連一條板櫈也沒的光棍，到底要好上幾倍。</p>
<p>不是有許多人睡在水門汀上過夜嗎？不是有許多人枕着包裏上在偏僻的馬路旁睡午覺嗎？雖然他們多半都是無家可歸的人們，可是却有許多睡在彈簧床上的『累得死』和『尖頭們』到十分欽佩他們放蕩的精神。在馬路上居然大膽睡覺，一點也不受禮節的拘朿，這一套到底是高貴的人們不能做到的。何况馬路上凉風習習，果然能夠代替電風扇。雖然塵土風場，灌滿了他們的鼻腔，幸而他們很少在馬路上吃美女牌冰淇淋，所以還不至於着塵土吃下而碍衛生。有許多人得不着好睡，又有許多人却睡得太多不免背痛。有許多人晚上不能夠睡又有許多人在晚上却想睡而偏要在白天睡、得不着睡和不夠睡的人們，當然都是一般由手到口的粗人，多睡一會兒便得挨餓一天，而睡得背痛或白天睡　的上等人，却也有他生活上的理由譬如説，當這炎炎夏日，即使屋子裏裝了冷氣管也仍觸得怪熱，甚至於要以冰淇淋來當飯吃，還有什麽好做呢？</p>
<p>除了睡覺也就沒有更发了的消磨光陰的法門兒了。至於等着晚上凉爽一點，平白的在睡夢中滑過，也又未免可惜，所以爲了珍惜起見，就得盡情的在夜裏快樂快樂。這樣一來，在白天補充睡眠，也是理所當然。至於有許多因爲打牌時手風太好，或者是鴉片抽得太飽，精神上過於興奮，睡覺時就免不了要失眠。　説這也是一種了不起的大毛病，非跑到上海來請牛醫生診治不可，甚至於還要到外國去長期休養。於此可知，睡眠一事，也很麻煩的哩。</p>
<h3>利</h3>
<p>— 六一</p>
<p>『天下熙熙。皆爲利來。天下攘攘。皆爲利往』。這眞是千古不易。中外一樣的定理。本來。『千里做官只爲財』</p>
<p>。但看那些掮着槍桿兒慣朝裏放的朋友。他們倘若不爲這個。勿舒舒齊齊的躺在彈簧床上抽大烟。擁抱着姣艷的姨太太。這樣窩心的日子不過。倒要調兵遣將幹着殺人的把戲麽？像小子這樣的獃子。亦終去不了這個。所以滿腔懷着僥倖的企望。遂不遠千里到這花花的地方來。代人家帮忙着。否則在鄉下老家裏。雖然住的是茅棚。睏的是柴舖。吃些粗粒菜羹。穿些粗布衣服。不見得長不到這般大。亦希望窮小子變做大老官。到鄉下去出出風頭。可是説也慚愧。做了人家幾個年頭的牛馬。窮小子始終是窮小子。恐再俟幾歲。就要兩鬢斑斑。龍鍾頽廢地入木的時期不遠了。等到有了這個。還濟的什麽事呢！反轉來説。小子現在己經變做團團翁的話。那亦不過鄉下的茅棚拆掉。到這天堂裏來建一宅洋棚。草柴舖改沙發床。粗米菜羹布衣改爲大菜福特克西裝。但是殺那問旅程。繁華的黃梁夢是極容易結束的。待到最後一杪鐘的呼吸定息。原不過一個硬綳綳東西裝進木箱子裏。和先前的窮小子有什麽兩樣呢？那麽海内的許多有錢大老官。都能夠這樣看破一點。在年結的時候。把紅單上開明着赢餘三十萬或　十萬裏分一半捐到慈善機關去。那這些長生庫定管門可羅雀。紅頭阿三放的印子錢。白相老頭子出借的皮球錢。亦特實　　終正寢了。（却酬）</p>
<h3>角糉</h3>
<p>— 賢</p>
<p>天是陰沉沉地，像一個病的老人。房内更是昏黯，我無聊的躺在床上，翻着一本新出版的雜誌。一陣急促的脚步聲，停住在我房門口，二房東的女兒奏進半個面孔，見我沒有睡熟，她像小鳥一般跳了進來。手中提着一串角糉，放在書桌邊後、微笑地站着。她老是那模樣，喜歡站着看我寫字讀書。她呌阿翠，她的母親這樣呌她，十四歲；據她告訴我二房東不是她的親生母親，她是被人拐騙來的，但是二房東還疼愛她。我抛了書，站起身來，走到書桌邊『阿翠那角糉？』我問她。</p>
<p>『姆媽送你吃的，她説端午不吃角糉』女人家都迷信，她初一月半總絶早起床焚香叩頭，所以對於底下一句話，她們認爲是不吉利的，她一扭身笑着跳出去了。</p>
<p>『阿翠，謝你母親』我下意識地説。端午，十天前我早已計算牠的來到，不過我以爲牠沒有這樣快，牠應該再要遲二三天。我抬起頭來，日曆上二十八日底下，確是我自已用紅筆註的端午節。本來端午節之類對於我並沒有什麽關係，我是撕完一組日歷換上一組新的。我從沒有計算過今天是元旦，明天是什麽，我賣自己的腦，吃自己的飯，計算對於我往往發生重大的失望。但是這一次，我從十天前就計算着端午節了。</p>
<p>半個月前，我的　老友他到我小樓來，他説：『端午節需要三十塊錢，你能代表設法嗎？</p>
<p>他是同我一樣，不過出賣的是勞力他跑來商是到我這窮朋友　顯見他己無路可走，我當時不知輕重的答應下來。</p>
<p>這説大不大，説小不小的數目，在坐汽車的目光中，一夜天可以化在跳舞塲裏，但是窮人出賣自己的身體，一個月不知有否如許的代價。</p>
<p>我奔波了幾天，免强凑足了他的數目、寫信告訴他端午節我早上送到他家裏，因爲有一部份的欵子、我也要今天去拿來。</p>
<p>我聽了阿翠的話，急忙穿起衣服我的老友不知等的如何焦急了，走進客堂二房東笑着問我吃了糉子沒有？我謝了一聲，飛也似的往外跑。</p>
<p>『有一羣人在顧到『端午不吃糉，老來嘸人送』等幸福夢，有一羣人在計算怎樣安渡他們的難關，人類竟是這樣的不平等嗎』？我在黃包車上想：『能夠斯完一組日曆換上一組新的，恐怕還有許多人求之不得哩！』</p>
<h3>英雄</h3>
<p>— 予</p>
<p>我們的英雄們是紫糖臉，飛毛腿，而常把水手帽載上半天的高個兒。他們拳頭大，臂巴粗，力氣就像小野牛，除在運動會裏奪錦標，課堂裏便宜行事外，常常做出些『路見不平拔刀相助』的勾當，雖然有時不免打打黃包車夫，踢踢小販，但大槪都是他們罪有應得。</p>
<p>這天，午餐之後，大家在抬球室裏嚼甘蔗，吃糖，和談天，『小扇子』陳，鬼鬼祟祟的進來，輕輕地説：『密司陸不是這幾天到校時很慌張麽，你們知道爲什麽？』</p>
<p>他一邊接了小程丢給他的橡皮糖，一邊得意地向各人臉上望着，於是再繼續説：『有人在甲乙丙，哈哈，窮兇極』</p>
<p>惡地』。</p>
<p>『豈有此理豈有此理』大家有些忿忿了。</p>
<p>『本來，這樣傷風敗俗的東西，就非得懲戒他一下不可，不過</p>
<p>他使勁地嚼着，淡淡地笑了笑：</p>
<p>不過，可惜我沒氣力</p>
<p>英雄們只是不響，最後，鎭靜地問·『眞的？』</p>
<p>『誰來騙你，他們還膽敢動手動脚』</p>
<p>，前天蜜司陸險些吃他們虧呢，都是我親眼看見。一</p>
<p>『好，明天看顏色』於是大家仍舊笑談着，像沒有這各一樣。</p>
<p>『顏色』，我却不大有機會看到，不過，看人家『看顏色』至少是一件有趣的事，於是，到明天吃飯之後，英雄和非英雄們都在離校幾十碼處分頭埋伏，當然是在小店裏，水果攤上這樣，不會使人注意，和報上的包探捉綁匪，倒有幾分像，只沒報上裝而己。</p>
<p>一會，蜜司陸來了，果然後面緊地跟着兩個西裝，歪帽子的人物，一面口裏不知在説什麽。</p>
<p>英雄的領袖就起了上去，先對蜜司陸説了些幾句，於是向着那兩位。</p>
<p>『豬玀，眼睛瞎了麽？』</p>
<p>『操那，儂啥人？關儂亂事丨』兩位不禁老羞變怒了。</p>
<p>英雄跳過去照準那人臉上就一下，怪清脆的。</p>
<p>於是四面的理伏都圍了上去，把二個可憐蟲困在坎心，拳兒在他們身上亂撞，肉着肉的聲音轟轟地，不過他們終算是乖的看看衆寡不敵，只得退了，面上一陣紅，一陣白的，的確是一種不平常的顏色。</p>
<p>『好。蠻好，曉得你們』他們强裝漂亮地。</p>
<p>英雄們是全勝了，他們唱着凱旋之歌，轟轟烈烈地回得校門。</p>
<p>『爽快』小扇子吁了一口氣『沒眼的，』竟在我們之前，侮辱起女性來，沒打斷他脚脛還便宜他們呢。</p>

<h3>蒙在鼓裏的中國人説：我得過且過</h3>
<p>店員通訊</p>
<h3>合夥營業的危險編者先生</h3>
<p>每誦貴攔答案，殊爲欣佩。我是靠父蔭，在本店學業的店員。最近，發生一件切身的　難題。事情是這樣的　；本店是家父獨資開設；在念餘年前，家父在外。合股設一字號。家父祇十股之一。一股之半，再存八千餘元存欵在該號。舉大股爲經理，家父對於該號營業，一切不加顧問該該號業己倒閉，虧負二十餘萬元。現各債權起訴，欲要各股東料理。各股東有無力應償者，也有暫時規避者，祇有家父與本店存在。查家父半股及存欵，　在倒賬之内。敢請先生解答：</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>（一）家父對該號債務、是否應負半股之責，抑或要負全部之責？</p>
<p>（二）如家父對於半股之責，無力担負，對於本店，有否有被封閉的可能？</p>
<p>（三）應用何法，能使本店不致受累？</p>
<p>事在眉睫，務望先生速賜大敎爲幸。專此敬頌編安汪伯壽敬問</p>
<p>編者按：這件事情，倘使完全照法律辦理，汪君的父親，責任非常重大。現行法規定，凡合夥開設的字號，全體股東，應以其全部財產，作爲該店債務的擔保；而且各股東間相互的關係，是要負連帶責任的。換句話説，要是這　店、虧負了二十萬，那麽二十分之一的股東，除了應該要拿出一萬來贖身外：要是其他各股東均無力償付，對於下餘的十九萬，也要負責的。再直捷的説一句，要是全體股東的中間，有一個的財產，足以贖身時，各債權有權單向此一人　主張償付；這就是合夥經商的危險。汪君的父親，旣經負了這種責任，應該平時注意到這店裏的情形：現在其他股東，多己窮兇極惡，或遠走高飛，事前豈竟一無消息哉？這却不能不自認大意</p>
<p>了。不過目下事己成事，怨天尤人，是不中用了；快想一個辦法罷。我們所以</p>
<p>要先把法律上的責任，詳細先説一説的緣故，無非希望汪君的父親，能夠明瞭自己的地位，肯認痛解决罷了。現在應當換人出來，向債權人商議，將自己的財產，除了日後生活所必需的少許外，全部公攤給債權人。他們見事成僵局，沒有不答允的；這因爲破產法規定，破產申請人，本有要求酌留生活費的權利的呀！此外應設法調查其他股東，有無隱　或作弊情形，如其有之，則另一方面，可請法院拘獲，或竟通緝歸案，俾經負擔。</p>

<h3>紅綠燈下（十一）</h3>
<p>— 禧林</p>
<p>參謀長從客廳走了進去，移時換了另一個走出來，他便是被派來帮他們的人了。這個人也很有些像參謀長的風度，説話呑呑吐吐地，甚至有時會默着一聲也不嚮。他第一步工作便是到周張等集合的所在地。周張在路上好像受了無限的委屈，厄自想着那些磨拳擦掌的同學們會如何的失望。到底李石喬經騐充足些，沿路上向那派來的人絮絮不休地解釋他們份子的純正以及愛國的眞實性等等。但那特派員否認對於份子的懷疑，他説他的任務只是在軍事的編制上來作相當的調查，石喬究竟疲倦過渡，走得一身冷熱怪膩人的，便叮囑了周紹平幾句，自己跑回家預備再睡一會。當他低着頭正走到門口，冷不妨一隻毛毛的手拍上他的肩膀，他抬頭一看，是立哈洛夫丨他常是這樣想引起人　家的親暱反而總惹起無趣，他説的話也常是很突然的使人一時摸不着頭腦，譬如他現在向石喬説：丨用不純熟的英語夾中國話。</p>
<p>『無論如何荒木的精神總是可佩服的丨我是恨日本人　的，但是他們的精神是好的！聽！』他的頭仰起，一陣砲聲在轟。『這才是人類的吼聲呢』！接着以一種令人不痛快的容封在一邊臉上，自以爲是對石喬的一種安慰態度，輕輕地説了聲：『李先生，中國好振作一下了呀』！便到廚房間去了。</p>
<p>石喬茫然地看着立哈洛夫的後影，懶洋洋地嘆了一聲：『這骸骨的迷戀者丨』</p>
<p>（八）有刺激性椰子，熱帶的椰子呀！</p>
<p>『長發丨亭子間的那李先生是我的堂兄，是我們一家人一樣的，曉得嗎！有什麽事呼喚你得好好地侍候！』</p>
<p>『是』丨長發只吐出一個字，身微屈着雖有着一般用人　對主子應有的恭敬態度，却毫沒有什麽畏怯的表情，粗黑的皮膚顯示他是一個廠裏的工人　出身，並不是做過輕事的茶房廚子之流，他便是楊介夫紗廠裏的工人，這次因戰事廠裏停了工，暫時被呌來帮三姨太燒燒飯，他在廠裏對介夫很忠實，是一個很精幹的走脚部下，每個月還能領到些津貼呢。</p>
<p>一去，好去燒晚飯了，老爺不會回來，李先生在這裏吃飯，多　點喝酒的菜，曉得嗎？』三姨太　揮下人素來是很莊重的，她能使平常最鎭靜的長發也不得不急促着脚步走出去。</p>
<p>長發是一個多才多藝的人，他能夠辦出一兩桌很貴重的酒席，現在他開始很熟練地調擺着各種菜蔬，廚檯上陳列得齊整整。阿珍自以爲是在三姨太前面的老資格，忍不住向他説道』：</p>

<h3>珍妮蓋諾離婚後新生活一般</h3>
<p>— 邨</p>
<p>痛定思痛却又尋新樂源</p>
<p>將置却爾斯法雷於何地</p>
<p>珍妮蓋諾和李特爾貝克離婚之後·她又獲得自由了，可以自由自在的去找尋羅曼斯，那末，對於這種自由的新生活，她將怎樣打算呢！她要再度和人結婚呢！還是因爲受了以前婚事的苦楚而不想重受婚姻的幻惑呢？她的計畫是什麽？</p>
<p>珍妮雖明白她從前的婚姻是錯誤的，但她並不懊悔這錯誤，他决不因痛苦而不受婚的幻惑，所以她説：『憂愁和快樂在生活素上是平衡的，或缺其一，就不能滿足任何人的慾念，有了憂愁纔會使我們崇拜快樂。</p>
<p>她説：『我滿想着找得新的婚姻，不是在短時期内，因爲我總得和媽信在一起，再過幾年：而近來電影上的工作和住房的設備，至少也要忙上幾個月呢。』</p>
<p>她的新信宅是租賃的，雖不及别個明星的那樣富麗堂皇，却也精緻幽雅有花園，有樹木，亭池草地，佈置適宜，屋内傢具的設備，都從自己最歡喜的買來，糜費的巨細，當然沒有限制的，她離婚後的光陰，眞可説其樂融融。不過像她這樣燦爛的明星，要解决婚姻問題，是一件很容易的事，也可説是一件很費躊躇的事，聽説現在好萊塢有兩打以上最有吸引性的靑年獨身男子願意接受她的婚姻，不顧捐去他們世界上的一切，祇要她肯犧牲與别人發生的羅曼斯，不獨有這個願望，還都在努力設法進行，據説其中劉亞理斯和傑美滕兩人最有希望，珍妮和這兩人感情也很好，歌舞塲中，宴會席上，都樂與周旋，不知將來鹿死誰手？</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評『夜不歸』</h3>
<p>— 燕南</p>
<p>當我走出新光的門口，聽到散出來的觀衆，互相談着：『夜不歸眞不錯』這張政子眞有意思一（？）等等的論調。的確，除了故事以外，演出的各方面，都是呌人很滿意的，我也不妨順着大多數人的意見，説一聲『影片本身是不錯』！</p>
<p>故事是再簡單沒有了，一個靑年愛上了一位女看護，因爲要談談體已話兒，所以一『夜不歸』，『據説是因爲大門關了，所以靑年回不了家）。爲了『夜不歸』靑年的母親着急了，立即呌兒了結婚，不道她寸步不離的跟着子媳，這一對新婚的少年夫妻弄得太窘了，女看護只好不别而行，靑年也追去，和她度密月去了。</p>
<p>這一位母親，倒眞像十八世紀的舊式老太太，後來兒子媳婦兩人走了，這一位老人又是多麽孤獨悲哀啊！</p>
<p>不過這片子是一餉滑稽劇，而絲毫沒有悲劇意味，所以把内心的一切都放開了，片中表現的，只有表面上的笑，</p>
<p>所以滑稽片終是一張滑稽片而己。</p>
<p>比較可談的還是表演，莎蘇薛茨ＺａｓｕＰｉｔｔｓ是有名的女卓别靈，在這片子裏，她當然是最成功的一個，一種慈愛溫柔的態度，很合宜的作一個看護的身份，中段受到老太婆的煩擾，她一種苦窘的表情，陰陽怪氣的行動，顯露着不安的心情，可以説恰到好處。她天生一付『哭死貓』的臉。來作這個有苦説不出，受氣沒辦法的可憐蟲，眞是妙極。男主角桑麥維爾ＳｌｉｍＳｕｍｍｅｒｖｉｌｌｅ和莎蘇旗鼓相當，傻頭傻腦，到末尾來了一個　　大居然奪得愛妻，此所謂傻人傻福。他一種單純的表演，的確令人笑不可仰。但是他知道去追求女人，可是一點也沒有『愛』的表情，似乎不及莎蘇，她能好似小烏依人般的作一個情人，而桑麥維爾却不是好對手，他們兩個人，都能代表出社會上某一種人的象徵，呌人捧腹大笑的地方，固然很多，而呌人哭笑不得的地方，亦復不少。他們合作，以老母在前，欲言不能，面面相覻一幕最好。老太太ＬａｕｒａＨｏｂｅＣｒｅｗｓ很有良美的成績，　里嚕囌，表示頑固人的管束兒子，頗有瑪麗特萊漱的風趣，不過滑稽有餘，而深刻不足。此外三個小孩子是好的。節外生枝的加入穿挿，顯得趣味，格外濃厚，全片因之而不見單調，只好説是導演的手腕不錯，其餘地方導演也很稱　而已，特殊精彩是沒有什麽的，配角都算不壞。</p>
<p>技巧上也許有人覺得是新鮮而很特别的，不過多半是分幕，比較可以算巧妙·所以結構連續以及影片編制方面，略見奇峯突起而在攝影光線佈景·一切都沒有特出處。</p>
<p>還有一點應當談一下的·兩位主角跑到唐人街去玩，突然中間好似不銜接。的確中間是被中央剪去了，我知道被剷的裏邊，是有不少中國人，每人都是戴西瓜皮帽，穿雙樑鞋，還有不少是赤着上半身，好像山東走江湖賣藝的·這實在有侮辱中國人之處，所以剪去，　但我以爲如果確寳有的，似乎應當根本禁止字，予以警戒，若僅僅剪去，運出中國時再接上，那末，中央這一剪豈非有些無謂吧？</p>

<h3>不得其門而入者每年二萬人</h3>
<p>茲據美國派拉蒙影片公司人員股主任但丁君報告，每年約有二萬人，離棄鄉井，到好萊塢去找事情做；但是經過一度失望之後，即仍回到本鄉去了。他們懷了極大的奢望而來，却失望歎息而去。現在失業增加，許多失業的人，都典質衣物，長途漫漫的來到好萊塢，但是那裏己經有了一萬七千位臨時演員，每月得不到一兩天的工作，正在呌苦連天之中。因此這般失業人們，失却所有的一切，長途漫漫地再往别地方試機會去了。可見黃金之國。亦不是樂土也。</p>
<h3>評『十三號快車』</h3>
<p>— 其英</p>
<p>一萬尺的影片，映了兩個小時，而故事所寫的僅僅三小時内所發生的事故</p>
<p>像這麽簡短的時間裏，編輯成了這一</p>
<p>個不錯的劇本，確是電影界非常少見的吧？</p>
<p>本事是一輛專車的開行，爲了匪人謀綁一位富翁，而破壞軌道，幸已被發覺，但是專車和另一列快車，祇好停在一個小站上，等鐵軋修復再行。快車上一位靑年下車游玩，遇見了女匪，中了匪人的圈套，代匪人向警察進攻，不過，不久以後，他覺悟了，立刻逃回快車</p>
<p>，這時鐵軋己修好了，專車快車，相繼開去，匪人也被擒了。</p>
<p>這一個劇本，原名Ｅｅｘｐｒｅｓｓｒ３ｉｓｌａｔｅ似乎應當譯爲『第十三次快車誤時了一，本來這影片所説的也就是第十三次快車晚到站三小時的經過而己，祇講次數而不用號的。</p>
<p>有人告訴我，這是一件實事搬上銀</p>
<p>幕的，我也眞有些相信，因爲在劇情劇旨各方面，我覺得都是烏發公司出品裏最無聊的，找不出什麽中心意味。</p>
<p>不過，演出以後，我知道多數的人可以滿意牠，覺得牠有許多成分，都是德國社會實况的素描，很淸楚的就是失業的嚴重、荆棘滿地的使資本家在德國</p>
<p>境内，也和在中國一樣的不安定，時時有被綁架勒贖的危險。</p>
<p>次重要的導演對於社會一般心理的描寫，非常透澈，用一個美麗女子做全片中心，由她引出匪人的團體，和靑年的中了美人計，毫不自知，都是反映出女子的魔力。</p>
<p>全片最成功的要算導演了，他自始至終用對照的方式，許多小地方，一一顯露出社會上人們的詭詐，口是心非，</p>
<p>特别那女匪，本來『見人説人話，見鬼説鬼話』，在今日世界上，原是很平常的，軌道被毁以後，工人的焦急，火車的　即刻停止，專車受到絶大的震動以及後半部警察和匪徒的鬥智角力，這些都是非常緊張的。</p>
<p>關於導濱，技巧等等，我因限於篇幅，難以盡述，反正凡是能發展的地方，他們都是盡力的討好，沒有放過一絲一毫的機會，我們再也不容易找出半個漏洞，這一點的確是德國製片者的精細，而且並不見怎樣費力，都很自然。但是在中國人看這張片子，許多德</p>
<p>國的實况，風俗，以及一切的一切都覺得有些看不慣似的，當然任何一方面</p>
<p>都和美國片不同。</p>
<p>表演除了女匪卡羅晚蘇莎ＣｈａｒｌｏｔｅＳｕｓａ以外，都沒有什麽成功，她表演非常靈活，特别是水汪汪的雙眸，已很能代表出一個兇悍能幹的蕩婦，男主角漢斯康奈克ＨｅｉｎｇＫｏｎｅｃｋｅ的確也有相當的努力，在許多美妙的夜景畫面裏，他能增加不少剌激性、表情却尋常。此外異味作風的演員，我覺得都是很能作戲，不過在德國民族性以外，實在找不出什麽特長。</p>
<p>爲了改換一下觀衆的口味，另一個作風的作品，雖然不是怎樣的巨製，終會受到一般的歡迎，而且這一張片子，在技巧各方面，到底也有相當的可取處。</p>
<h3>電影小説關睢之歌ＴｈｅＳｏｎｇＯｆＳｏｎｇｓ（三）</h3>
<p>— 恩蘋</p>
<p>那少年得了意懇切地瞅着她，説她以書爲生應當對藝術表示同情。藜莉給他這一句話打動芳心。那少年又説他總算是一個藝術家，一面掏出一張名片交給她。</p>
<p>藜莉笑着。她聽見門鈴響處，她的姑母手臂挽着藍進來了，她趕快把那名片塞入衣袋。那少年也趕快拿起一本書，一面偷看着藜莉。她的姑母疑神疑鬼的看了形勢，就蹣跚着跑到後房去了。少年見那老怪物走開了，便低聲對藜莉期望今夜務請前來，説着出了。他一去之後，藜莉頓覺店裏多麽寂寞，她手摸着暖熱的胸脯頭的名片，耳朶裏好像還聽見懇切的聲音顺説『今夜您能來嗎』？一點樂意透澈她的芳心。凄凉孤獨的冰　畢竟深化了。</p>

<p>(Beiping) The Central Government has always been committed to resolving the Chahar issue through peaceful means.

<p>Puppet Troops Between Tangshan and Luanzhou Moved Away From the Railway Line</p>
<h3>Officials of the Beining Railway Negotiate with Japanese Representatives, Reaching an Agreement on International Trains</h3>
<p>Tianjin The Beining Railway originally planned to operate an international train between Tianjin and Yuyu, but it was suspended due to the lack of sincerity from the Japanese side. Later, in order to restore traffic between Luyu, Secretary-General Gu Boyin was sent to the Japanese warship at Dagu Kou on the 24th to meet with representatives of the Kwantung Army to negotiate the withdrawal of puppet troops from the railway line in order to facilitate traffic. As a result, the Japanese side stated that the puppet troops between Tangshan and Luanzhou would be moved away from the railway to maintain the passage of passenger and freight cars. Gu returned to Tianjin on the 25th with satisfactory results to report and went to Beiping that night with Qian Zongze to ask for instructions on everything. Qian returned to Tianjin from Beiping on the 26th. According to him, the problem of traffic on this railway has made some progress and will be realized in the shortest possible time. As for handling procedures, it is not as rumored outside because the Bureau intends to proceed with traffic procedures without hindering national sovereignty. All the rumors are not true. (26th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to railway news, puppet troops in Luanxi began to retreat from Xugezhuang and Tianzhuang to Tangshan starting on the 25th. Most of them will gather in Luanzhou, but there are still more than 200 puppet troops in Tianzhuang. It is estimated that they will be completely withdrawn on the 27th and 28th. Traitors Li Jichun and Zhao Lei are already in Tangshan. The intention behind the withdrawal of the puppet troops is still unclear. (26th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Puppet troops have been actively expanding their strength recently. Li Jichun, Zhao Lei, Zheng Yanhou, Cheng Guorui, and other troops are still stationed in Fengrun, Yutian, Tangshan, and along the Luan River area. All local bandits in all areas have been incorporated by the puppet troops. Li and others have recently been instructed by a certain party to establish a new regime in the occupied area, and a large amount of funds has been provided by a certain country. The main agency is determined to be located in Luan County. The nineteen counties in Hebei that are occupied are scheduled to be placed under their command. We believe that the activities of the puppet troops are extremely difficult to resolve. Negotiations with the Japanese side have been resumed. Yongjin went to Changchun to meet with Mutō, but there has been no reply telegraphed to Beiping, and it is still at a standstill. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Beining Railway Bureau Director Qian Zongze previously sent a secretary and director to Tanggu to negotiate with the Japanese side, and the opening of international trains between Tianjin and Tangshan has been agreed upon. Operations will begin today. (26th Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the news of the Beiping-Yuyu traffic, it is difficult to achieve until the puppet troops in Luandong withdraw. Recently, the peak of summer has arrived, and people from various countries in Beiping and Tianjin usually go to Beidaihe and Qinhuangdao to escape the heat. This year, due to the obstruction of traffic on the Beining Railway, it is impossible to go. At the same time, the business of the Kailuan Coal Mine has also been greatly affected, so the United Kingdom and the United States have expressed great dissatisfaction with the Japanese side, and there is a temporary proposal to open international trains. The Japanese side, fearing accusations from various countries, notified the Beining Railway Bureau on the 24th to send representatives to Tanggu on the 25th to discuss the issue of the Beiping-Yuyu international train. The Railway Bureau immediately sent representatives to discuss it and decided that the Railway Bureau would send a train to Qinhuangdao on a trial run to inspect the wires and tracks along the road to see if they have been repaired as a preparation for opening. In addition, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Italy, Japan, and other countries sent armed soldiers to protect the train. The result was quite promising. Beining Railway Bureau Director Qian Zongze came to Beiping from Tianjin on the evening of the 25th to visit Huang Fu and report on the negotiations. Also, the train of American soldiers going to Qinhuangdao was originally scheduled to depart from Tianjin at noon on the 25th. However, it was reported that the puppet troops refused to pass through Tangshan, so the departure was suspended. After the Japanese side notified the puppet troops to protect and release the train, it was decided to send the train from Tianjin to Beiping first on the morning of the 27th, and then depart from Beiping, but it is not yet certain whether it will go directly to Qinhuangdao. (26th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the disposal of puppet troops, we have been in contact with Mr. Zhongshan, the acting representative of the Japanese embassy, for days, requesting him to urge the Kwantung Army to reply as soon as possible so that a solution can be reached as soon as possible. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Lutai Telegram) Currently, the puppet troops of Zhao Lei are in the Hetouzhen area. The puppet troops in Ninghe City are still strictly inspecting pedestrians. A unit of the Japanese army in Yinzhuangzi has retreated, but a small number still remain and have not fully withdrawn. The head of the Niulanshan Public Security Branch is appointed by Ji Chun, with a monthly salary of 150 yuan. The 50 policemen have a minimum monthly salary of eight yuan, and the monthly expenses are more than 2,000 yuan, which is paid from local donations and taxes. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tongxian Telegram) At 10 AM on the morning of the 24th, a Japanese cavalry lieutenant, Nakazaki, with a translator and more than 20 soldiers, fully armed with two machine guns, went from Dashawo in Sanhe to Xijizhen, 40 li southeast of the county, and inquired in detail with the local public security bureau whether our troops had crossed the canal and whether there were any troops arriving locally. After occupying the area for three or four days, they went west to Xiguan Village in Sanhe. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The traitor Shi Yousan is indeed in Tangshan, allied with Li Jichun, and has received assistance from the Japanese. He has recruited thousands of people in Luandong. According to Yu Xuezhong, the focus of the puppet troop disposal issue is the location of the troops after their incorporation, because the number of troops can be negotiated. If they are still stationed in the counties of Luandong, it is really a breeding ground for trouble, which we will never allow. Therefore, the restoration of traffic on the Beining Railway must wait until this matter is resolved. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>

(3) Downstream, Jiujiang 44 chi 4, Wuhu 27 chi 2, Nanjing 2 chi 5, Zhenjiang 18 chi, all 1-2 cun to 5 cun higher than the 25th, predicted to rise. (26th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Water Level in Hankou Did Not Rise or Fall Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Hankou) The water level did not rise or fall on the 26th. The water mark was still 4 zhang 7 chi 2 cun in the morning. After rising sharply every day for half a month, it has now stabilized. The water in the special districts and concessions along the river has flooded sidewalks and reached the base of the dikes, and the floodgates along the dikes are two layers high. The China Travel Agency is isolated in the water. From the morning to the afternoon of the 26th, there were more than a dozen heavy and light rain showers. The climate is extremely uneven. The sewers are blocked, and sewage is stagnant, which may lead to an epidemic. Rents in high-lying areas and rice prices have skyrocketed, especially affecting the livelihoods of the poor. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) On the 26th, the Yangtze River water level did not rise or fall in Chongqing, Yichang, Shashi, Changsha, Yuezhou, Hankou, Xunyang, and Anqing, except for Wuhu and Zhenjiang, which each rose 4 cun. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Yangtze River Waterway Improvement Commission Holds Meeting</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Yangtze River Waterway Improvement Commission held a plenary committee meeting on the 26th. More than ten committee members attended, presided over by Zhou Xiangxian, chairman of the commission, and reported in detail on the recent high water level of the Yangtze River, the organization of the six-province flood prevention association, and the flood prevention plan that was passed. Then, discussions began, and the committee members expressed many opinions. It was decided to transfer all technical personnel to flood prevention work and authorize the chairman to handle everything in accordance with the organizational regulations and flood prevention guidelines of the flood prevention association. In addition, some administrative staff of the association went to Xunyang on the 26th, and Zhou himself is scheduled to go by boat on the 27th. Song Xishang, director of the Public Works Bureau, along with engineers and technicians, is rushing to prepare the application charts and will complete them in a few days and then depart for Xunyang. (26th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Wang Orders Daily Submission of Water Level Reports</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Premier Wang believes that the flooding of the Yangtze River is of utmost importance to the livelihoods of the people. On the 26th, he notified the Yangtze River Waterway Improvement Commission to submit daily water level reports from various locations for easy reference and to instruct the provincial and municipal governments to pay attention to prevention. (26th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Flooding in the Lower Reaches is Still Very Worrisome</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Song Xishang, Director of the Public Works Bureau of the Yangtze River Waterway Improvement Commission, told reporters on the 26th that although the water level in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River has been rising daily for two days, it is estimated that the water level may be stable because the upper reaches of Chongqing and Yichang have slightly receded. However, on the 26th, a telegram was received from Chongqing stating that the water level had risen by one chi again, and the weather was gloomy, so it is feared that it will continue to rain. Therefore, the flooding in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River is still very worrisome. (26th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Hankou Is Not Currently a Disaster Area</h3>
<p>(Hankou) The National Government Relief Flood Committee told guests today that the general public has been describing the flood situation in Hankou, but in fact, it is not yet a disaster area. Although the river water is level with the bank, the newly built dikes along the river are several chi higher than the bank, so it is still safe even if it continues to rise by several chi. The speaker also mentioned that the dikes built by the committee last year were built to be as strong as possible. Last year's high water was not enough to test whether the main dikes of the Yangtze River and the Han River are strong, but this year is a great test. During the great flood in 1931, the dikes of the Han River only gradually collapsed when the water level exceeded 42 feet. The main dikes on both sides of the Yangtze River only breached when the water level reached 46 feet. The residents of Hankou are quite reassured because they know that the Changgong Dike on the back of Hankou is very strong, but if the water level reaches 50 feet, it is indeed dangerous. Judging from the situation upstream, the river water is expected to start to fall soon. The speaker concluded that dredging projects should be handled exclusively by a central agency to replace the current system of provincial management so that efficiency can be realized.</p>

<p>Yongding River</p>
<h3>Water Level Drops by Three Feet</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Heavy rain on the 24th of this month caused mountain torrents to erupt in the upper reaches of the Yongding River in Huailai, Xuanhua, and Xiahuayuan. Many areas near the river in Huailai suffered flooding. On the morning of the 25th, the water mark at the Lugouqiao Qianlong Temple rose to 1 zhang 4 chi, and the local dam sweep at No. 42 of the fourth section of Beisi was six or seven chi, which almost caused an accident. The River Affairs Bureau ordered its employees to defend the situation. The weather cleared yesterday and today, and the water level dropped. At 6 PM this afternoon, the water mark was 1 zhang 1 chi, 3 chi lower than before. Various sections along the river are still actively defending. (26th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Yellow River Suddenly Rises Six Feet</h3>
<p>(Zhengzhou) The Yellow River suddenly rose by six feet, with a very fierce momentum, more than twice as much as the heavy rain two years ago. The river embankments in various places are uneven, and if the water level rises again, the danger is extremely worrisome. The River Affairs Bureau has requested the provincial government to allocate 50,000 yuan to repair the embankments. (26th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Japan's Wartime Budget Reality</h3>
<p>Now that Japan has swept across our four northeastern provinces, its "Continental Policy" can be said to have been largely realized. However, in reality, this cannot make up for its domestic economic panic. The number of unemployed workers is nominally only 480,000, but in reality, it has exceeded 2 million. Although wholesale prices have risen, they still do not help the poverty of the industrial sector. Moreover, as a result of the prevalence of nationalism, Japan's foreign trade is increasingly in difficulty. Recently, India and Australia have both restricted the import of Japanese-made products, and our China has become even more impoverished due to Japan's aggression and is also unable to purchase foreign goods. It is clear that Japan's exports are being hit hard. Therefore, the Japanese warlords and the scholars and politicians who are attached to the military department have to continue to advocate their so-called national crisis and strive to strengthen their army and navy and expand their military operations as much as possible, creating a so-called emergency period to cover up their internal contradictions arising from the economic panic. This year's wartime budget of more than 2.3 billion yen is an unprecedented creation in Japan's financial history, and the Japanese people's inability to bear this huge burden can also be seen. According to the estimates of the Japanese Ministry of Finance, the total amount of the budget for the next fiscal year (1934) will be more than 3 billion yen, of which the Ministry of the Army will account for about 600 million yen and the Navy will account for about 450 million yen. Other departments, such as the Colonial Affairs Bureau and the Ministry of Finance, will also expand considerably. However, even if tax rates are increased, the total revenue will only increase by 30 to 40 million at most, which will not be of much help to the expenditure side. Therefore, apart from issuing domestic debt, there is really no other appropriate way to fill the deficit. However, why are the Japanese warlords determined to adopt this wartime budget at the expense of their national strength? There are several reasons for this: First, Japan knows that since the September 18th Incident, the Soviet Union has adopted a peaceful and conservative policy toward Japan, but it is not really willing to retreat but only wants to complete its second five-year plan. The current peace cannot be relied upon, so it is necessary to strengthen its defense against the Soviet Union. Moreover, in the past two years, the Soviet Union has shifted its national development and industrial strength to expand its military. Even in terms of the latest mechanized corps, the Soviet Union has four divisions nationwide. Even if Japan expands once this year, its mechanized corps will only have two regiments, which is far from enough. Therefore, the item of "military equipment maintenance expenses" in this year's army budget amounts to 250 million yen, most of which will be used in this area. This can be asserted.</p>
<p>Second, recently, the relationship between Japan and the United States has been characterized by the discord in economic relations between Britain and Japan, and disputes caused by increased taxes in India, Australia, and other places. Since a political understanding between Britain and Japan is impossible, the Japanese have turned to the United States. As a result, the saying of Japanese-American cooperation has spread throughout the country. However, this kind of movement is only a temporary and unnatural cosmetic, and the atmosphere in the Pacific is still dangerous. The United States is building 32 warships, which is clearly a preparation for war. Among them are two aircraft carriers, each carrying 290 aircraft, which are not only enough to protect the mainland of the United States but also to threaten the airspace of Japan. Therefore, the Japanese Navy Department has to use more than 400 million yen in three phases for naval construction. Third, Japan's invasion of China has temporarily come to an end on the surface due to the signing of the Tanggu Truce Agreement. In theory, it should not expand, but the reorganization of the Kwantung Army, its so-called "Manchurian Incident expenses," is still no less than 130 to 40 million yen, and temporary expenses are not included. The number of armed immigrants will increase to 1,000 households per year, with a population of more than 5,000. Their ambition for North China has not diminished slightly. Just look at the recent rampant puppet troops in eastern Tianjin, and you can know that their conspiracy to disturb North China is far from over.</p>
<p>The above three points are what the warlords call national crisis, which is the emergency period they want to create. How can they not prepare this wartime budget?</p>

<h3>Two Memorial Week Reports</h3>
<p>Ao Zhihui: Demolition and Construction Proceed in Parallel</p>
<p>Qin Zhen: Concentrate Strength in the Center</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held a memorial week on the 26th. Over four hundred people, including Qin Zhen, He Yaozu, Chen Shaokuan, Lin Xiang, Lü Chao, and National Government staff, attended. Chairman Lin led the ceremony. Qin Zhen reported, stating that at this time, it is necessary to concentrate will and strength under the leadership of the central government to resolve national crises. The nation, at this point, is like a seriously ill patient. Both traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine have been consulted, but the opinions and plans of the various doctors differ, only increasing disputes and not helping the illness. Current issues include resistance against Japan and the suppression of bandits, and now the issue of floods has been added. Floods are definitely not natural disasters, but partly because there was not enough time and economic resources to prepare in advance, and partly because those managing the water acted independently. For example, Hunan and Hubei could not agree. The lack of concentrated strength and comprehensive planning led to the disaster. If the government were not hampered by other issues and the central government properly managed water conservancy, it would not have come to this. Otherwise, if those responsible cannot fulfill their responsibilities, the national situation will become even more dangerous. At this time, it is crucial to avoid emotional disputes. It is hoped that comrades from all sides will submit their opinions to the central government and contribute their strength to the central government. Only with a strong central government can the administration of state affairs be effectively managed. (Central News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Party Headquarters held its 84th memorial week at 8:00 AM on the 26th. Over six hundred people, including Ye Chucang, Wu Jingheng, Zhang Weicun, Xie Zuomin, Xiao Zhongzhen, Zheng Zhanan, Xiao Jishan, and staff, attended. Chairman Ye Chucang presided. Wu Jingheng reported, generally saying that he recently visited Hunan and the previous day visited Wuhu and Xuancheng. He felt that these were lands of beautiful mountains and rivers, fertile soil, and abundant resources. If construction could be pursued and development diligently pursued, they could certainly surpass Europe and America. The Party's revolution has only achieved demolition work, while neglecting construction work. Dr. Sun Yat-sen once told students, "Study without forgetting to save the country, save the country without forgetting to study." Now, it should evolve to "Demolish without forgetting construction, construct without forgetting demolition." Currently, there are small groups of bandits everywhere, red bandits in Jiangxi, and foreign enemies in North China. We must find ways to overthrow them before discussing the vigorous pursuit of construction. In particular, county magistrates who bear political responsibility must clear out bandits in their demolition work and dredge rivers and build ponds to eliminate floods in their construction work. Do not shirk responsibility or be careless, as the future of the country truly depends on it. (Central News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>

<h3>United States Devotes All Efforts to Implementing National Economic Policy</h3>
<p>Prepares to Persuade Various Countries to Adopt Similar Policies</p>
<p>To Consolidate the Foundation for the Revival of International Trade</p>
<p>Roosevelt Meets with Davis for Consultation</p>
<p>(New York) The US government's recent wavering attitude toward the various issues discussed at the London Conference has surprised and worried many within the United States. For example, the rumor of stabilizing the US dollar was immediately denied by the US government. Secretary of State Hull's recent declaration in London placed the issue of reducing tariffs above the issue of stabilizing the US dollar. Undersecretary of State Moley's sudden trip east and his mysterious mission have all attracted public attention. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, reliable sources revealed that although the US President believes that restoring foreign trade will help American industry, his hopes for economic revival are almost entirely placed on developing the domestic market. Although Secretary of State Hull applied to the economic conference to eliminate trade barriers, President Roosevelt has decided that the revival of domestic economies in various countries is the most direct way to revive world trade. Therefore, Moley's trip to England is to persuade various countries to adopt schemes similar to those implemented in the United States. Once the domestic economies of most countries have recovered, they will be able to expand their international trade on a sound basis. Otherwise, even if international trade can show temporary prosperity, it may not have a solid foundation. The reason for the US President's change of attitude is that the volume of trade in the US market has increased more than a month ago, and the large number of confirmed orders shows that the recovery of trade will continue for at least several months. Therefore, the US President feels that the elimination of trade barriers, which the US delegation previously regarded as the main goal, is only a minor part of the overall plan for reviving the domestic economy. Moreover, since Washington proposed reducing tariffs and eliminating other barriers, several countries in South America and Europe have been eager to take the opportunity to promote sales in the United States. Concluding reciprocal treaties would hinder the US revival plan. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Since the US government announced today that it believes the failure of the economic conference will not greatly hinder the US economic recovery plan, concerns about further currency inflation have arisen in major cities tonight. According to financial circles, since the US government is now devoting all its efforts to raising prices, if the World Economic Conference fails to agree on stabilizing the price of silver, the US government may attempt to use silver as a tool for currency inflation. Both silver and gold advocates are eagerly awaiting the silver draft to be submitted to the London Monetary Committee tomorrow. Most silver advocates predict that if the representatives attending the London conference reject the proposal to stabilize the price of silver at a higher level, the US President will definitely find his own way to raise the price of silver, either by using silver in the hard currency reserve or by widely minting silver coins, in order to achieve the goal of raising the price level of various domestic products. However, New York bankers are mostly opposed to further currency inflation. It is said that the new banking law alone is enough to worry them, let alone a new movement to inflate the currency. The Glass-Steagall Banking Act will soon be implemented, because the clause guaranteeing deposits under $10,000 is quite unfavorable to bankers. Therefore, most of the New York banking community feels apprehensive about the new banking law, believing that no country has ever used this guarantee as a nationwide experiment, and that significant losses have occurred after the experiment in eight US states. Furthermore, the law will grant the Federal Reserve Bank tremendous power to regulate banks, and it is doubtful whether it will be able to implement it effectively. However, although the banking community does not support currency inflation, it is predicted that the US President will continue to pursue the policy of inflation. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(New York) According to the Economic and Financial News Agency, US Undersecretary of State Moley, under the order of President Roosevelt, is going to Europe to convey the President's instructions to the US delegation to the London Economic Conference, so that they can negotiate with the major industrial countries to implement a multilateral compromise on the 30-hour work week system. If this agreement is established, any country that does not comply should be prohibited from importing goods from that country, but raw materials will not be included in the prohibition. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(New York) Although President Roosevelt is cruising off the coast of Massachusetts on a yacht, he still has the important events taking place in Europe in mind. According to today's news, the US President has summoned Davis, the US representative to the Disarmament Conference, who is regarded as President Roosevelt's ambassador to Europe. After receiving the order, Davis rushed to the Atlantic coast, boarded the President's yacht, and discussed the latest developments in the World Economic Conference with the President.</p>

<p>World Economic Conference</p>
<h3>Monetary Committee Discusses Silver Issue</h3>
<p>Our Representative Requests Swift Adoption of Stabilization Measures</p>
<p>India Agrees to Cooperate in Regulating the Silver Market</p>
<p>Most-Favored-Nation Clause Applies Without Restriction</p>
<p>Japan Plans to Contact Various Countries Separately</p>
<p>(London) The silver committee of the World Economic Conference met this morning. The meeting was quite short and did not seem to make progress, but discussions are currently underway behind the scenes. It is widely believed that when an agreement is reached in the future, it will be based on the US representative Pittman's silver proposal. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) The silver subcommittee of the Monetary Committee of the Economic Conference held a closed-door meeting this morning. The chairman was the US representative Pittman. In addition, there were representatives from Mexico, Canada, Peru, Bolivia, India, China, and Spain. The meeting first exchanged views on whether to conclude an agreement to restrict the sale of raw silver on the market and to restrict the sale of large quantities of silver stocks on the market. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) The silver subcommittee of the Monetary Committee has received India's promise to cooperate in regulating the silver market. At the meeting this morning, the Indian representative Houstan guaranteed that the Indian government would not dump its 40,000 ounces of silver reserves on the market. This silver reserve is often a threat to the international market, causing silver prices to plummet. Now that the Indian representative's guarantee has been obtained, a major step has been taken towards stabilizing silver prices. The Chinese delegation's advisor Bei Songsun then gave a speech, commenting on the early restoration of the gold standard and urging the subcommittee to take steps to stabilize silver prices as soon as possible, stating that what China urgently needs is the stability of silver prices, regardless of their ratio to gold. Fluctuating silver prices have made it practically impossible for China to trade. Subsequently, the representatives of Bolivia and Peru gave brief speeches, supporting China's proposal to stabilize silver prices as soon as possible. After the adjournment, Chairman Pittman told reporters that he felt that after India's agreement to cooperate, the biggest obstacle to stabilizing silver prices had been removed. It is now clear that the representatives of the eight countries in the subcommittee are all prepared to cooperate fully. (National Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) The Japanese delegation is becoming increasingly impatient with the slow progress of the World Economic Conference. Today, it was learned that the Japanese delegation plans to take a separate action, contacting various countries such as Britain, the United States, France, Italy, and Germany separately to begin bilateral negotiations. The aim is the unrestricted application of the most-favored-nation clause. However, it is said that the Japanese delegation will not take any action for the time being in the next few days, hoping that Dr. Moley, advisor to US President Roosevelt, who is already en route, will bring new instructions and give the conference a new impetus. However, British officials expressed optimism about the progress of the conference, believing that the conference has reached its current stage a week earlier than expected. Today, the US delegation stated that Moley's arrival in London will not necessarily change the US delegation's position. Another US representative told a Reuters reporter that the conference is in danger of slowing down because it is expected that Moley will bring a remedy in his bag. This hope must not go beyond reasonable bounds, otherwise the conference will be disappointed. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Japanese Government Considers</p>
<h3>Economic Diplomacy Policy</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Due to the still weak hopes for the future of the World Economic Conference, the Japanese Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Finance, and Commerce and Industry believe that the failure of the conference will inevitably lead to intensified international trade competition. They are now considering economic policies after the conference. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has decided to concentrate its efforts on economic diplomacy in the future, and is conducting research on the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Exploration of New Markets: Promoting the sales routes of Japanese goods in "Manchukuo," East and South Africa, the Near East, South America, and Pacific Islands. Also, increasing the dispatch of commercial attachés to enhance the function of protecting export laws to achieve the rational development of new markets.</p>
<p>(2) Adoption of Reciprocity: In order to open up new markets or maintain old markets, reciprocal agreements may be concluded with the other country when necessary, stipulating tariff policies or sharing import quotas. However, the principle of utilizing the most-favored-nation clause, which Japan has advocated in recent years, will be followed.</p>
<p>(3) Implementation of Export Control: Eliminating the drawbacks of uncontrolled competition and dumping policies among Japanese exporters. The current Export Association Law will be changed to a mandatory participation system, with the greatest emphasis on implementing controls, especially effective preventive measures against dumping in overseas markets.</p>
<p>(4) Policy towards Britain and India: Efforts should be made to avoid competing with British goods. A reasonable compromise point should also be found in the Japan-India trade issue in order to resolve it satisfactorily. Efforts should also be made to prevent the repercussions of the India-Japan issue from affecting trade relations with Canada, South Africa, and Australia. Japan's relations with these self-governing governments will be adjusted by means of reciprocity. (Japan United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Sino-Soviet Negotiation on the Sale of the CER</p>
<h3>Russo-Manchu Conference Begins</h3>
<p>Japan Pulls the Strings Behind the Scenes for the Puppet State</p>
<p>Political Issues Expected to Be Discussed as Well</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The conference on the purchase of the Chinese Eastern Railway (CER) opened at 2:00 PM today at the residence of the Japanese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs. The representatives of the three parties were as follows:</p>
<p>(Soviet Side) Ambassador to Japan Yurenev, Far East Minister Kozlovsky, CER Soviet Representative Koznitzky, and other attendants. (Japanese Side) Foreign Minister Uchida, Vice Minister Shigemitsu, Director of the European and American Bureau Togo, Chief of the First Section of the Western and American Bureau, Lieutenant Colonel Suzuki of the Military Affairs Section of the Army Ministry, Secretary Miyakawa of the Embassy in Russia, and official Shimizu of the Foreign Ministry. (Manchu Side) Manchu Envoy to Japan Ting Shih-yuan, Manchu Vice Foreign Minister Ohashi Chuta, and CER Manchu Representative Shen Jui-lin.</p>
<p>After Foreign Minister Uchida declared the meeting open, he delivered a speech in Japanese, welcoming the Russian and "Manchu" representatives to Japan and expressing the hope that the representatives of the two countries would exchange sincere opinions to achieve their goals as soon as possible, while limiting the meeting to purely commercial negotiations. After the Foreign Minister's speech was completed, Secretary Miyakawa translated it into Russian and Shimizu translated it into Chinese. Next, Soviet Ambassador to Japan Yurenev expressed his gratitude for Foreign Minister Uchida's mediation in starting the negotiations. The Manchu representative Ting Shih-yuan also thanked the Foreign Minister and expressed that "Manchukuo" would make sincere efforts to resolve this issue. After the three parties completed the diplomatic formalities, the Japanese side left the Chief of the First Section of the Western and American Bureau of the Foreign Ministry and Lieutenant Colonel Suzuki of the Army Ministry as observers, and all the others left the meeting hall. Then, the Russian and "Manchu" representatives began the first day of formal meeting, first deciding on the following points: (1) The method of negotiation in the future, holding informal meetings at any time; (2) Inviting Japanese representatives to attend when necessary; (3) Other methods of conducting the proceedings. (Japan United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The first day of the conference on the purchase of the CER adjourned at 4:00 PM. Tomorrow will be suspended because the Russian side needs to request instructions. The next meeting is scheduled to reconvene on the 28th. (Dentsu News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The main purpose of the negotiations on the sale of the CER is to determine the purchase price and its conditions. However, in reality, the views of Russia, Japan, and "Manchukuo" on political issues will determine the fate of this case. Therefore, the conference seems to have no choice but to mention the following political issues: (1) The issue of a Russo-Japanese non-aggression treaty; (2) The issue of Russia abandoning North Sakhalin; (3) The issue of Russian-Japanese fishing rights in the Maritime Province. Therefore, this conference can be regarded as a revised version of the Portsmouth Conference after the Russo-Japanese War in previous years. (Japan United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Our Protest Regulations Not Yet Announced</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Our country's protest against the Soviet Union's sale of the CER, the protest letters sent to Japan and Russia will be announced when they are delivered to the two governments. At the beginning of the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, there was a discussion on negotiating a mutual non-aggression treaty. Our side advocated ratifying the 1924 Sino-Soviet Agreement as valid, which should include the CER issue. One of the reasons currently cited by the Russian side is that China cannot exercise its powers on the railway. This is due to the failure to confirm the legal point of the establishment of the puppet organization, and also ignores the legitimate interests obtained by China in the treaty. As for the mutual non-aggression treaty, while it was still under negotiation, the Russian side disclosed our country's important opinions, resulting in the Japanese taking active action to buy the railway. The Foreign Ministry has already raised questions with the Russian side. (Special dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>The Background of the CER Sale</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The conference on the sale of the CER opened today. Since Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov verbally proposed this matter to Japanese Ambassador Ota in Moscow on May 2, it took less than fifty days to reach the point of formal negotiations. The reason for this is the positions and claims of the following three countries: (1) The Soviet Union's Position: The Soviet Union has decided to sell the railway because the CER has been continuously losing money recently, and its political and economic value has decreased due to the emergence of "Manchukuo," recognizing that its future is hopeless. However, abandoning the railway is a major shift in Russian national policy, so there were also dissenting opinions within the government. However, the faction that is familiar with the Far East situation, such as Stalin and Litvinov, advocated forcefully, and the decision to sell was made. (2) "Manchukuo's" Position: "Manchukuo" originally planned to establish a railway policy to surround the CER and reduce its effectiveness. "Manchukuo" also believes that the Soviet Union's rights on the railway are not ownership rights, but the joint management rights of Russia and "Manchukuo." Therefore, it believes that this conference is a negotiation to buy this joint management right. (3) Japan's Position: Japan only takes the trouble of mediation in this negotiation and limits its purchasing behavior to a purely commercial transaction. Therefore, if the Soviet Union raises political issues and makes the meeting fall into disputes, it is determined to move forward resolutely. (Japan United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>French Envoy Requests Preservation of Creditor Rights</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The French Ambassador to Japan, Madel, visited Vice Minister Shigemitsu of the Japanese Foreign Ministry at 11:00 AM today, expressing France's views on the sale of the CER, stating that during the Tsarist era, Russia borrowed 6 million gold rubles from French capitalists to build the CER. Since the revolution in 1917, the principal and interest have not been repaid. The Paris government has received the CER sale communiqué and ordered the ambassador to solemnly declare to the Japanese government that French capitalists are determined to maintain their original rights, and hope that the Japanese government will pay close attention. Vice Minister Shigemitsu replied that regarding the CER debt, the statement in 1924 has clearly demonstrated that its responsibility lies with the Russian government, and Japan is not the opponent to buy the railway, so it cannot be responsible. It is hoped that the French government will raise this issue with the Russian and Manchu governments. The Japanese government cannot guarantee French creditor rights. (Chinese Allied Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>American Newspaper Says China and Russia Have a Secret Treaty</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) At the start of the negotiations on the purchase of the CER, Julius Hoot, a foreign correspondent for the Chicago Daily News, published in Tokyo today the content of a secret Sino-Russian treaty on the construction of the railway. Article 4 of the treaty states that the Chinese government agrees to the construction of a railway across the two provinces of Heilongjiang and Jilin to Vladivostok for the purpose of preventing the Russian army from approaching invasion sites in the two provinces, with the purpose of attacking Japan. If Japan had known about this secret treaty at the time, it would have seized all of Manchuria at the Portsmouth Conference in 1905, and there might not have been this purchase negotiation today. Hoot said that the original text of the secret treaty is still in the custody of the US State Department. (Dentsu News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Banque Industrielle de Chine</p>
<h3>Protest Against Sale of CER, Creditors Have the Right to Intervene</h3>
<p>Talks by a Diplomat</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhu Boquan, liquidator of the Sino-Russian Banque Industrielle de Chine, protested to Japan and Russia against the Soviet Union's sale of the CER. The reporter asked a diplomat about the legal issues involved. According to him, the CER was built by the Sino-Russian Banque Industrielle de Chine, jointly established by China and Russia. The capital was also borne by the bank. At the beginning of the bank's establishment, we contributed 2 million taels of shares, with French shares being the most. The bank closed down in 1926. The shareholders of the bank became the holders of CER shares, enjoying the railway's creditor rights, which have also been repeatedly recognized by the Soviet Russian government. Now that Soviet Russia has sold the railway without authorization, the Banque Industrielle de Chine has the right to intervene as a creditor and has a sufficient legal basis. Moreover, France is also paying close attention to this. The French ambassador to Japan has asked the Japanese authorities to pay attention to France's sovereignty over the railway. If Russia sells the railway, France may also intervene. (Central News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Anglo-Russian Trade Negotiations</h3>
<p>(London) Some progress has been made this morning in resolving the Anglo-Russian trade war. After British Foreign Secretary Simon met with Soviet Russian Foreign Commissioner Litvinov for half an hour, Overseas Trade Bureau Director Colville issued a communiqué stating that Simon and Litvinov exchanged views at the Foreign Office, explaining the positions of their respective governments on the obstacles to the current Anglo-Russian trade negotiations and expressing that they would meet again in the next few days. The participation of Colville in the talks this morning shows that the terms of renegotiating the commercial treaty, as well as the issues of releasing British engineers and lifting the Russian goods ban, were also discussed. This morning, Soviet Russian Foreign Commissioner Litvinov told reporters before going to the British Foreign Office that the possibility of resolving the Anglo-Russian conflict depends on the British Foreign Secretary's proposal. The Moscow government insists that Britain must lift the ban as the first step in resolving the dispute. (National Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) When Soviet Russian Foreign Commissioner Litvinov met with British Foreign Secretary Simon this morning, it was heard that Litvinov suggested that Britain abolish the Russian goods ban and not continue it after it expires on July 20. Litvinov could then propose to the Soviet Russian Central Executive Committee to release the two British engineers. However, Simon has not yet accepted. It was also heard that Litvinov will take a surprising move soon, concluding a non-aggression treaty with the Little Entente. It was further heard that the Netherlands had secretly indicated that if the current trade deficit between the Netherlands and Russia could be turned into a surplus, the Dutch government could recognize Soviet Russia. However, Litvinov insisted on diplomatic recognition before negotiating any commercial arrangements. (National Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) The Soviet Russian side is very tight-lipped about the meeting between Foreign Commissioner Litvinov and Foreign Secretary Simon. The general impression is that if Anglo-Russian negotiations are to succeed, it will take a long time and be extremely difficult, as Soviet Russia seems unwilling to make concessions.</p>
<p>Tokyo Plans to Build</p>
<h3>Far East Broadcasting Station with 150 Kilowatts of Power</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Because the 10-kilowatt broadcasting power of the Tokyo Central Radio Station in Japan is difficult to compete with the world, it plans to build a powerful broadcasting station. It is currently cooperating with the Ministry of Communications in planning, and it will be included in the fiscal year 1934 budget, and the completion period is expected to be about two years.

<p>Occurence of the Puppet Organization</p>
<h3>Puppet Emperor Puyi's Resignation Farce</h3>
<p>Confiscation of Properties of Powerful Officials in the Eastern Provinces</p>
<p>(Beiping) A returnee from Changchun spoke of a recent farce in the puppet state, where the puppet emperor Puyi resigned. Zhao Xinbo, Xi Qia, and others proposed to the Kwantung Army headquarters to confiscate the properties of former powerful officials in the three eastern provinces of the puppet state of Manchukuo. The proceeds would be used to expand the puppet army within the passes, construct public works in the cities of the three provinces, and reward those who had made meritorious contributions to the puppet state. After this proposal was promulgated, Puyi was resentful and said to Zheng Yun, "You are driving us to extinction, making me bear the name and be scolded. What's the point? Be more restrained and leave some room for your descendants." Zheng replied that he had already obtained the Kwantung Army's consent. Puyi was even more furious, saying, "Since you have the Kwantung Army as your master, why do you need to find me?" He scolded Zheng and threatened to resign. Later, the Kwantung Army headquarters intervened and mediated, stipulating that the confiscated real estate would remain sealed for the time being and could be returned to those who came back, while the movable property would be disposed of separately. The proceeds would be used to support the special agent teams in the passes, such as those of Li Jichun and Zhao Lei, to expand the army. Puyi then gave up his insistence. The movable property of various prominent families in the three eastern provinces was uniformly disposed of. This amounted to more than 13 million yuan. Recently, Li Jichun and others have received 3 million yuan to expand the puppet army and plan to occupy Luandong for a long time. The Puyi resignation farce in Changchun then came to an end.

<p>Yang Sen Arrives in Chongqing</p>
<h3>Discussing Bandit Suppression with Liu Xiang</h3>
<p>Deng Xihou Sends Telegram Requesting a Stop to Military Calamities</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Yang Sen arrived in Chongqing on the 25th to meet Liu Xiang and discuss bandit suppression policies. (26th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Residents of Ningyuan, Xichang, Hanyuan, and Yuexuan counties formed an anti-tax alliance army to oppose Liu Wenhui and support Deng Xihou. (26th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Deng Xihou sent a telegram to the central government, stating that Wenhui had provoked incidents without cause, lasting for more than a month. Despite repeated telegram orders from our central government to return to their original defense areas, this army attempted to occupy invaded territory and resisted orders. Furthermore, due to the engagement in war, the Red bandits took the opportunity to re-enter Tongnan. The central government, alarmed by the seriousness of the bandit disaster, repeatedly ordered a return to their defense areas to assist in bandit suppression. However, Wenhui not only disobeyed but also launched a large-scale plan to endanger Sichuan with bandits. The situation has reached its extreme. Therefore, our central government is requested to order the Sichuan armies to implement military restraint, ensuring that each returns to their original defense areas to facilitate the withdrawal of troops for bandit suppression. If Wenhui continues to engage in covert warfare, deliberately obstructing the cooperation of various armies, the suppression of bandits will be impossible to achieve. If the Red bandits spread, it will become a prairie fire. Wenhui is not worth pitying; what about Sichuan? (26th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Deng Xihou sent a telegram to Sichuan members of the Central Committee, saying that when Zi Qian and Hou were ordered to transfer troops to assist in the suppression of Red bandits, they invaded my garrison area and attacked my rear defense. Subsequently, a clear order was received from the central government to cease fire and return to their original defense areas. However, Zi Qian blatantly disregarded the order and intensified the attack, engaging in fierce battles for over ten days without end. Although I complied with the order, he exhausted his troops to bombard and destroy embankments, burn civilian houses, and act with violence and cruelty, doing whatever he pleased. The national crisis could not touch his heart, and the Red disaster could not move his mind. He regarded the people as grass and the central government as mere decorations. His nature was prone to chaos, and he knew no limits. Gentlemen, with concern for your hometown and advocating for justice, please submit a request to the central government for severe punishment to uphold national law and warn the wicked. Please also send a telegram directly to Zi Qian to explain the great righteousness and urge him to obey the order to cease fire and withdraw to his defense area. Your prayers are deeply appreciated. Deng Xihou, respectfully. (26th Special Telegram)</p>

Afterward, the government announced that it had confiscated 250 rifles, 600 pistols, and 200 bombs. All family members of those who secretly possessed military weapons were arrested pending investigation. Police also claimed that the revolutionaries seemed to have planned to occupy police stations and government offices, but investigations revealed that no military personnel had been incited. Furthermore, judging by the small amount of ammunition, even if they started a revolt, it could not last long.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Sofia, 25th: The Bulgarian National Assembly today passed a bill stipulating that anyone who commits assassination or is directed by a political group to attempt assassination shall be sentenced to death. This measure aims to curb the violence of the Macedonian Conservative Party. Last night, the capital was heavily patrolled by police, traffic was cut off, and residents were prohibited from going out. It has been this way until noon today. Meanwhile, a thorough search for weapons and suspicious individuals is also underway for this reason.</p>

<h3>Anti-Treaty Revision Movement</h3>
<p>Havas, Prague, 25th: A large-scale demonstration against treaty revision was held in the Yafoona region. The Czech Ambassador to France, Vosusky, is currently in the country and also participated in the movement, giving a speech praising the union of the Czech and Slovak peoples and expressing belief in democracy, saying that the strength and future of the country depend on democracy.</p>
<h3>Vatican Church Bombing</h3>
<p>Suspect Apprehended</p>
<p>National News Agency, Vatican City, 25th: A suspect has been apprehended in the St. Peter's Church bombing case. The results of the investigation have not yet been released. It is said that the person claimed a suitcase from the storage after the incident. The paper contained within matched the paper used to wrap the bomb. Police suspect that the person retained two suitcases, one empty to dispel suspicion, so they were immediately arrested. It is said that the person acted strangely, feigning mental illness. National News Agency, Rome, 25th: In today's bombing outside St. Peter's Church, damage was minimal due to the bomb's weak explosive power. The three people injured by the blast were treated at the hospital and are not seriously injured. The bomb was left with the church doorkeeper by a person whose name is unknown, but it exploded shortly after. Inside the church, nothing was heard, and services continued as usual. All sorts of rumors circulating outside are uniformly denied by official communication channels.</p>

<p>Japan's Finances Approaching Crisis</p>
<h3>Expanded Demands from Various Provinces</h3>
<p>Ministry of Finance Deeply Troubled</p>
<p>Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun, June 20th: The Ministry of Finance authorities, after a cabinet decision, will strictly adhere to a policy of austerity and make every effort to suppress unrestrained budgets in order to reduce the issuance of deficit public bonds. However, during the compilation of the next fiscal year's budget, each province still tends to submit requests for considerable amounts. The Ministry of Finance, in any case, will strive to economize and has decided on the following policy: (1) For general new requests, if the expenses are urgent and unavoidable, they may be approved, but it must be verified whether they are used effectively and appropriately. (2) Recently, the Budget Bureau sent administrative officials to various places to inspect the implementation of local relief projects, and it is believed that there is room for reduction. (3) The cost of the Manchurian Incident is estimated at 186 million yen in the eighth fiscal year; now that Jehol has been pacified, it will naturally decrease in the ninth fiscal year. (4) Improvement expenses for military preparedness must pay attention to political considerations, so they must be strictly verified by administrative authorities. (5) Make every effort to save on established payment. The above five principles will be strictly implemented, but it is questionable whether the provinces will follow the Ministry of Finance's intentions, as they all have special considerations. For example:</p>
<h3>Ministry of the Navy</h3>
<p>In compiling this budget, in light of the internal and external situation and the defects of the London Naval Treaty, it is determined to carry out a second supplementary plan and implement improvements in military preparedness. Recently, due to the large expansion of the US Pacific Fleet, the Navy's ambition to construct a unified great navy on the Atlantic... makes Japan uneasy, so Japan must implement the second plan for... such as new warship maintenance costs, warship construction costs, land and water consolidation costs, warship repair costs, naval equipment overhaul costs, aviation maintenance and equipment costs, totaling about 123 million, and military preparedness reform expenses of about 50 million, that is, the next year's budget will increase by 50-60 million compared to this year.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry</h3>
<p>The agricultural and forestry ministry's agricultural relief policy has been a long-standing issue... Therefore, the budget will be increased from 60 million yuan to 120 million yuan. Other expenses, such as agricultural insurance currently under investigation, and state-run inspections of agricultural products other than rice and raw silk, will also require significant funds.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs</h3>
<p>In order to adapt to the extraordinary diplomatic policy, the Ministry requested an increase in funding when forming the budget for the ninth fiscal year. The reasons are: (1) Since Japan is an empire withdrawing from the League of Nations, apart from extremely... issues, regarding cultural, peaceful, and social undertakings, the matter should be based on national cooperation. In order to achieve this goal, a new Department of International Culture should be established to allow free activities. (2) Due to the world economic recovery, although Japan participates in conferences, in order to prevent the economic imperialism of India and the British Empire and its colonies, it is urgent to establish permanent economic diplomacy. (3) In order to achieve the above two goals, overseas embassies should be strengthened. In addition, consulates should be added and commercial officials should be assigned to Egypt, Turkey, and other Near Eastern countries, India, the South Seas Islands, and Manchuria, which have close trade relations with Japan.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Commerce and Industry</h3>
<p>The new items determined in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry's budget for the next fiscal year are: (1) Important industrial assistance expenses, export control facility expenses, important mineral assistance expenses, and unfair competition prevention expenses, totaling about one million yuan. In addition, additional budgets are requested for fuel, gasoline, resource development and control.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education</h3>
<p>With the cooperation of the temporary petition of last year, the state treasury subsidy for city and township ordinary primary school expenses is 12 million yuan. In addition, the state treasury will bear 85 million yuan for compulsory education expenses in the ninth fiscal year. Other facilities, such as preventing student thought problems and school teacher thought problems, also require large amounts.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Justice</h3>
<p>The total amount of new requests from the Ministry of Justice, excluding the budget of the Ministry of Finance's Construction Management Bureau, is about 2.5 million yuan, such as new prison construction costs, thought crime crackdown costs, local district court establishment costs, and employee treatment improvement costs.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Railways</h3>
<p>In the ninth fiscal year's budget, from the standpoint of the railways alone, its revenues and expenditures are as follows: Capital is estimated at 140.8 million yuan, supplies are estimated at 166 million yuan, and income is estimated at 580.8 million yuan, totaling about 770 million yuan in expenditures. Among them, 40 million yuan for railway construction costs, 50.178 million yuan for railway improvement costs, and 3 million yuan for provincial automobile line equipment costs, totaling 93.178 million yuan have been decided. On the revenue side, capital income is about 105 million yuan, supply work income is 166 million yuan, and operating income is estimated at about 563 million yuan, totaling 835 million yuan. However, due to the increase in railway revenue, expenses for railway electrification, international train extension, improvement of passenger and freight transport equipment, expansion of provincial automobiles, and other expenses have all increased.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Colonial Affairs</h3>
<p>The main new projects requested in the Ministry of Colonial Affairs' budget for the ninth fiscal year include 20,000 immigrants to Brazil, 1,000 self-defense immigrants to Manchuria, 100,000 Manchurian immigrants (farmers, businessmen, and workers) (five people per family), the establishment of Manchurian immigrant training centers (four locations: Harbin, Fengtian, Gongzhuling, and Xiong Yuecheng), the establishment of a Colonial Affairs Deliberation Council, cotton cultivation association subsidy and encouragement fees, and fuel and merino sheep association subsidy and encouragement fees, which are also very large.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications requests a special accounting system in the ninth fiscal year, such as postal services, telegraph services, engineering services, management, savings, and insurance. The electrical, shipping, and aviation bureaus are compiled in the ordinary accounting system, according to an amount of 350 million yuan. Other expenses, such as the expansion and improvement of telegraphs and telephones, the reconstruction of local post office buildings, and aviation liaison transportation subsidies, are estimated at 70-80 million yuan in the ninth fiscal year.</p>
<h3>Ministry of the Interior</h3>
<p>The most important issue for the Ministry of the Interior in compiling the budget for the ninth fiscal year is the relief expenses for the current situation, which are the same as the budget amount for the eighth fiscal year. Among them, the civil engineering expenses alone amount to 98 million yuan and cannot be reduced at all. Therefore, although the Ministry of Finance wants to tighten up as much as possible, judging from the new requests from the provinces, there is an increase rather than a decrease, and the financial future is quite difficult.</p>
<h3>Hankou River Water Reaches the Shore</h3>
<p>Water Level at 47 Feet, a New Record in a Century</p>
<p>Three Towns Invaded by Water, Dikes and Gates All Reported to Be in Danger</p>
<p>Jianghan Main Dike Not Solid, Provincial Government Presents Petition to Chiang (Kai-shek) for Instructions</p>
<p>Hankou Communication: The torrent of the Han River continues unabated. On the morning of the 24th, the water level recorded at the marker was 46 feet 8 inches, a further increase of 6 inches from the 23rd. In the afternoon, it rose another 2 inches, totaling 47 feet. On this day, the Hankou riverbank had already been flooded. The flooded area of Wuchang and Hanyang has also expanded. Nearby dikes and gates are in imminent danger. The provincial and municipal authorities' rescue work is more tense than before. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the River's Torrent Along the Banks</h3>
<p>The distance between the Hankou riverbank and the river water was four inches on the 23rd, and the waves had already reached the shore. On the morning of the 24th, the flood rose more than six inches, two inches above the flat shoreline. Except for the higher areas, all riverside docks were flooded to varying degrees. Qiaokou, Luojiadun, Xinjiadi, and Xiaojiadi were also flooded to varying depths. The disaster area of ​​Jinshazhou, Baishazhou, Xiongjaiti in Wuchang, Jijiazui, and Yingwuzhou in Hanyang increased. In the deep water, the water could reach the knees. Traffic will gradually be cut off, and panic is at its extreme. The flooded residents gathered on nearby mountains or dikes, building sheds to live in, in a very miserable state. There are three sources of river water: one is Sichuan water, one is Han water, and one is Xiang water. In recent days, the water level in Changsha, Yichang, and Chongqing has slightly fallen, while Yuezhou and Shashi are still rising. The Xianghe River water is rising even more rapidly. The Sichuan water has decreased, while the Xiang and Xiang rivers are still increasing. In addition, the Dongting Lake is overflowing. Since Hunan is not connected, it will inevitably expand to the north. Therefore, although Chongqing and Yichang are stable, there is still no room for excessive optimism. This reporter met with Xi Dejiong, director of the Engineering Department of the National Economic Commission, on the 24th. According to him, the water level of the Han River today has broken the record of nearly a hundred years. In the past, the disaster in Hubei Province was particularly severe, and the dikes were completely destroyed, which was more dangerous than in other provinces. I originally planned to discuss with the local authorities here and then go to other places, but now that the situation is serious, I decided to stay in Hankou to supervise the rescue and work with people from all walks of life to save the disaster. Fortunately, the upstream water has been stabilized. If it does not rise again, there should be no worries. According to those familiar with the water situation, whether Wuhan will suffer from floods again can be decided by the weather, sunny or avoidable, and rain is unavoidable. Zhu Jiu, Yang Dinghua, Xi Kuang, Huang Chongji, and other members of the General Headquarters and the National Economic Commission, are scheduled to take a boat east on the 25th, passing through Huanggang, Zhangshigang, Xinshun, and Wuxue, to Jiujiang, along the way to survey the dikes and water situation. They will return to Hankou from Jiujiang in about one month to report on the inspection.</p>
<h3>Rescue Work is Tense</h3>
<p>In addition to the solid construction of the riverside flood control project along the river, the breaches have been boarded and filled with earth, making it difficult to collapse. The remaining dike gates in the suburbs of Wuhan have all experienced dangerous situations. On the Wuchang side, the Wujin Dike, the Baishazhou breach, the Wufeng Dike, the Xujiapeng gun hole, the Wuqing Gate, the Wutai Gate, the Changfeng Dike in Hankou, and the Zhanggong Dike, both the Jintan and Yintan sections are leaking water at the same time. The foot of the Wufeng gate dike is eight zhang (丈) long, with five leaking points. The water leakage is especially fierce at the Jiajiashan gate. Currently, rescues are being carried out separately. The Provincial Flood Control Association held three regular meetings on the 24th, passed rescue measures, and gave priority to organizing four engineering teams, each with 30 people, to guide and protect. If this is not enough, the organization will be increased. The Construction Department and the Hankou Municipal Government regard dike protection and flood prevention as central tasks. The Construction Department Secretariat has communicated to all sections that the official documents for reporting risks on the dikes undertaken are processed as soon as they are received, so as to be swift and avoid delays. All positions are on duty until 10 pm, and two people are dispatched on Sundays to work as usual. Li Fanyi, director of the Construction Department, went to Beijing to attend the five-province flood control meeting. The meeting has now concluded and is scheduled to return to Hubei from Beijing by plane on the 25th to preside over the meeting. Wu Guozhen, Mayor of Hankou, also personally instructed the Secretariat to inform all sections and shares that all employees of the Engineering and Affairs Department and the Materials Committee must serve at any time on this Sunday, the 25th, and will not take a holiday. The remaining personnel are stationed in the government to await deployment and must not leave without authorization. It is reported that the Municipal Government and the concession authorities of Japan and France will hold a Sino-foreign flood control conference to implement cooperation between China and foreign countries. It is also reported that when the river water rises to 48 feet, personnel from all organs and organizations will be mobilized for rescue to save the endangered situation.</p>
<h3>Provincial Government's Report on Dikes</h3>
<p>The provincial government reported to the General Headquarters on the 24th that the Jianghan Main Dike was either poorly managed, or had seeped, or had already collapsed, and the situation was extremely dangerous, and requested instructions. The document stated: "Presenting this report. According to Cai Guanghui, the concurrently serving Magistrate of Puqi County, the dikes, one to five number (字號) on Jiangshang (江上), are all two feet lower than the flood level of the 20th year [of the Republic], and should be heightened immediately. However, the reply from the Director of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau contains many prevarications, and please order a quick dispatch of personnel to heighten and repair." Accordingly, after reviewing the original presentation, and the Bureau's reply, the Commissioner's letter stated that the earthworks of the current dikes, based on actual measurement results, should be submitted to the Engineering Department of the Economic Commission for approval and repair, and the project funds have also been allocated long ago, preventing abrupt changes. If the dike body is deemed insufficient in earthworks, please continue to follow the annual repair and protection regulations of the former Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau and supervise the local people to repair it themselves. The original dispatch of personnel from the Bureau for actual measurement did not measure low points on one to five number of Jiangshang, for one dike within it, so as to cause omissions of measurement, and the reason is unknown. The annual repair and protection regulations approved by the Water Conservancy Bureau stipulate that local officials supervise the embankment defenders to heighten and thicken it, but Hubei Province has just been pacified and has not yet recovered. The dike defense institutions in various places are not yet fully organized. Although the regulations were promulgated in the 20th year [of the Republic], the Water Conservancy Bureau did not handle the embankment works in the 21st year in accordance with the regulations. On March 29th of this year, the Engineering Department submitted a table of repaired dike sections, which stated that after the Bureau took over, the earthworks of the current Jianghan Main Dike would be uniformly repaired to the flood level of the 20th year [of the Republic], with a slope of one to one by three, to ensure permanent stability and prevent water damage. It has also been instructed by the Provincial Government that if any of the embankments on the Jianghan Main Dike that has been added to the earthworks are less than the flood level of the 20th year and the slope is not up to the standard of one to one by three, the Bureau should quickly handle it to avoid negligence. Now, according to the aforementioned situation, the Bureau had already omitted it when it started measuring the projects in various places, and it did not follow the instructions of the local reports and the Provincial Government. Now, the river water is increasing more and more, and I am deeply worried about the future. In addition to the instructions and separate orders to the Construction Department to instruct the dike inspection committee to conduct a thorough inspection and the Jianghan Engineering Bureau to quickly dispatch workers to heighten and repair it, I hereby report the situation to your seat for review and approval. Furthermore, the Jianghan Engineering Bureau is managing the embankment works in Hubei this year, and some of the original plans were not included, and some were poorly managed, and some were seeping and collapsing. The local reports or local people reported the following:</p>
<p>(1) According to Liu Ji, the Administrative Inspector of the Eighth District of Xiangyang, the Lao Long Dike telegraphed in March on behalf of the Lao Long Dike, stating that on December 27th of last year, a letter was sent to the Jianghan Engineering Bureau to survey and repair the Lao Long Dike, and the Bureau replied that it had transferred the letter to the Sixth Engineering Office for estimation, but the survey work has not yet been carried out, and please transfer the order to expedite the matter. The Prefectural Decree stated that the Bureau presented a report on March 23rd, stating that according to the Sixth Engineering Office's re-estimation, it was included in the secondary project. In April, the Commissioner telegraphed that the embankment body under the Lady City [a section of the Great Wall in Xiangyang] was collapsing, and there were more than ten other dangerous places. The Prefectural Government again ordered the Engineering Bureau to quickly adopt effective measures and expedite the matter. The Bureau ordered the Shayang Temporary Engineering Office to re-survey. After repeated delays, on June 3rd, the Bureau forwarded a telegram from the Shayang Engineering Office stating that the engineer Xiong Zuo Zhou had been dispatched to estimate the repair. It will be submitted for review after the estimate report is made. The summer floods arrived early, and the water has risen for a long time. The survey documents of the Engineering Office have not yet been submitted, and the project implementation is just empty talk. On the 13th of June, the Bureau reported that it had drafted a flood control fee of 3,000 yuan and submitted it to the Economic Commission, not knowing whether it could be approved. On the 17th, according to the Bureau's report, after the personnel dispatched by the Shayang Engineering Office re-surveyed, there were more than ten dangerous places, especially the Lady City, the foot of the Shuishuiji, Shangwan's Juanjia Wharf, and the embankment foot of Xia Chou's Protector Hei Miao Temple. It is difficult to start work in the near future due to the rising water, so we can only rush to prepare for flood control, and we have allocated and telegraphed a total of 3,000 yuan to Liu Commissioner to be responsible for flood protection.</p>
<p>(2) Huanggang Duling Main Dike: The dike is ninety li long. In March of this year, according to the civic representatives of the dike, He Fa, etc., the embankment body is weak and lower than the flood level by two to three feet. Please transfer the order to the Jianghan Engineering Bureau to survey and repair, etc. The Bureau was ordered to report on the 4th, stating that the original project plan had been included in the outline, but the National Economic Commission reduced and deleted it because the project funds were too large. On May 27th, according to the Bureau's report, the Second Engineering Office reported that the repair of the Xiaowan of the Li family and the two places of Pugongdun have been approved and must be completed before May 20th. The Bureau has already agreed to selectively repair the dike. However, according to Da Zhang, the head of the Huanggang Liujiaji District, the terrain of the Yuanji Road section is low and has not been surveyed. Please transfer the order to assist in the repair, etc. The Provincial Government has transferred the order to the Engineering Bureau to send personnel for verification and reporting, but has not yet received a reply.</p>
<p>(3) Jiayu Wufeng Dike: According to Wang Youxuan, the director of the Jiayu Dike, etc., the director of the Third Engineering Office, Lu Gongda, colluded with contractor Liu Bingtang to raise the price, and for the project, he cut high and filled low, and dug the soil to see the new. The Provincial Government ordered the Jianghan Engineering Bureau to investigate and reply, stating that the soil was taken too close to the embankment section, the shrinkage was insufficient, and the compaction work was especially lacking. As for the other corrupt practices, there was no factual evidence found. The Prefectural Government instructed to investigate whether the ponds for taking soil near the dike had been filled, and whether the missing compaction work had been completed. According to Wang Youxuan's re-presentation, the Engineering Office delayed the matter. Now, the Dike Inspection Committee of the Construction Department has been ordered to conduct a detailed investigation, but no reply has yet been received.</p>
<p>(4) Xianning Yongqing Suisheng Five Family Dike: According to Zhou Ziliu and Luo Yikun, the local people of the Sixth Village of Jiayu County, the chief of the Third Engineering Office, Lu Gongda, was not familiar with the project and made mistakes in surveying first, and the deputy engineer Lu colluded in corrupt practices later, destroying the old dike and filling the Langkang. The Prefectural Government ordered the Jianghan Engineering Bureau to report that Sun Weibo, the inspector, had carefully verified that it was true and had ordered the director, etc., to order the tools to be used to rebuild the dike. Whether the rebuilding has been implemented or not has not yet been reported to the Prefectural Government by the Engineering Bureau.</p>
<p>(5) Tianmen Guanjikou Five Branch Angle Dike: Before the new Yue dike was built this year, according to the people's representatives of Tianmen, He Zhenghu, etc., and the public welfare associations of the county and province, the seabed was not built and the floating soil was piled up. The Prefectural Government ordered the Jianghan Engineering Bureau to report that Chen Yuwei, the inspector, had reported that there were more than ten places filled with sand and soil, and the workers had been ordered to dig out and refill, and they had been completed, and they had been reported back and forth. Just as the matter was being verified, He Zhenghu, etc., again reported that they were deceiving and covering up. The Prefectural Government has separately ordered the Dike Inspection Committee of the Construction Department to conduct a detailed investigation.</p>
<p>(6) Jinshui New Gate: The gate is the preliminary project of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau to build a gate. According to Cai Guanghui, the administrative inspector of the First District, the surface of the gate is only a foot higher than the current water level. Xuan Yu, the Magistrate of Wuchang County, telegraphed on the 20th to report that the gate had collapsed at 10 a.m. that morning, all previous efforts had been wasted, and the area had become a swamp. The reports have been filed one after another.</p>
<p>(7) Shishou Jiangbei Diao Nanyuan Main Dike: According to Liu Ji, the Magistrate of Shishou County, the Jiangbei Zhang Dao Nan Yu's Dike could not be completed on the day, because the subsidy funds could not be paid on time. On the day, the dike collapsed. The original Wenhua case has been reported.</p>
<p>The above are just a few of the main points. The dikes on both sides of the Hubei Jiang River are all dikes, and if there is even a small lack of solidity, it could put hundreds of miles in danger. Since the Engineering Bureau took over for the first time, it is inevitable that there will be a lack of familiarity with the terrain, the danger, and the flow of water. In addition to doing our best to command within the possible scope, in order to ensure safety, I hereby attach the above situations. I respectfully request your approval on how to handle the matter."</p>
<h3>City Government Flood Prevention Report</h3>
<p>The Hankou Municipal Government submitted a report to the Provincial Government on the 24th, regarding the flood prevention situation in Hankou.</p>
<p>It requested the Jianghan Engineering Bureau to promptly dispatch dedicated personnel to be responsible for protection. The submitted document stated: "Upon investigation, the Municipal Government previously observed a sudden rise in river water and dispatched personnel to measure 43 locations along the river embankment, including various wharves and sluice gates, filling 59,908 cubic feet of yellow earth. Additionally, 13 concealed ditches and cave entrances along the river were filled with 5,533 cubic feet of yellow earth. Initially, the Jianghan Engineering Bureau agreed to prepare the yellow earth, but later requested that the Municipal Government purchase it, with the Bureau reimbursing the expenses. The Municipal Government has already handled the procurement and cleared out the gate panels at each wharf, stacking them separately for use. Although earthbags were used to block the Shaijiashan sluice gate, due to the rapid rise of the water, the gate leaked severely, causing water to flow inward with a gurgling sound. An investigation revealed that the water level outside the gate was 13 feet higher than inside, posing a significant risk. The Jianghan Engineering Bureau has yet to repair it. The Municipal Government has dispatched workers to build a wooden panel retaining wall at the gate, filling it with yellow earth. The cost of materials will be invoiced to the Jianghan Engineering Bureau for full reimbursement upon completion of the work. As for the Zhang Gong Embankment, the water level has increased, and the embankment foot at Yintan in the sixth section is weak, raising concerns about potential accidents. The Municipal Government recognizes that the Zhang Gong Embankment is crucial to the lives and property of the entire city. Although the Jianghan Engineering Bureau is primarily responsible, the Municipal Government, in a coordinating role, dares not shirk its responsibility, lest it repeat the catastrophic flood of previous years. In addition to sending letters to the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, requesting them to promptly dispatch engineering personnel to take charge of the command and deployment, the Municipal Government has also instructed its own engineering personnel to take over repairs when necessary. Furthermore, engineering personnel have been assigned to patrol and report on the water levels along the river and embankments in sections, in order to provide early warning and prevention. Therefore, a document has been prepared to report to your esteemed government the recent flood prevention efforts of the Municipal Government and the measures taken, requesting your review and approval. It is also requested that the Jianghan Engineering Bureau be instructed to promptly dispatch dedicated personnel to take charge of protection, which would be in the public interest. (24th)"</p>
<h3>Jiang Guangnai Returns to Fuzhou</h3>
<p>丨Military Officer Meeting Convened in Zhangzhou丨</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Jiang Guangnai, Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government, previously accompanied Chen Mingshu to Guangdong to engage with the Southwest authorities. Having completed his mission, he returned to Fujian by ship from Hong Kong on the 17th, arriving in Xiamen on the 18th. He then took a car to Zhangzhou, where he and Cai Tingkai jointly convened a meeting of senior generals, including Deng Shizeng, Huang Qiang, Shou Nian, Shen Guanghan, and Mao Weishou, at the 19th Route Army Headquarters that evening. They reported on their trip to Guangdong, discussed future policies concerning the current situation, and exchanged opinions. On the 19th, Deng Shizeng was dispatched to Guangdong to meet with Chen Mingshu, report on the Zhangzhou meeting results, and discuss a joint plan with Chen Jitang to suppress the communist bandits on the border between Fujian, Jiangxi, and Guangdong. On the 20th, he and Cai Tingkai went to Longyan to inspect the military situation at the front. On the 21st at noon, he returned to the province from Zhangzhou by plane, proceeding to the Shuibu Sanqiao Club to rest before returning to his private residence on Niaoshi Mountain. He only went to the Provincial Government to work on the 21st. According to Jiang's conversation with reporters, this trip was to return to his hometown to take care of personal affairs. His time in Hong Kong and Guangzhou was short. Although he met with Chen Jitang and Huang Shaoxiong, there was no in-depth discussion about the current situation. Regarding the reports of the Southwest expanding the national salvation organization, he stated he was not very clear about it. Chen Zhenru originally intended to come with him, but was unable to due to illness. He will come to Fujian once he recovers. As for all the officers and soldiers of the 19th Route Army, they still adhere to their consistent stance on resisting Japan, and there will be no changes due to the ceasefire in North China, and so on.</p>
<p>The 19th Route Army's Anti-Japanese Vanguard Team, after receiving orders to return, caused the volunteers who had joined along the way to be filled with grief and indignation. Although Zhang Yan and Tan Qixiu tried their best to explain, many have left the team due to discouragement in recent days. After the vanguard team returned to Fujian, it was planned to merge with the old troops of Zhang Zhen from western Fujian, Yongding, and the 49th Division, and reorganize them into two divisions, with Zhang Yan and Tan Qixiu as division commanders. They will be sent into Jiangxi to suppress bandits. At the same time, the 19th Route Army Headquarters has established a new recruit training center outside the East Gate of Fuzhou, at Kangshan, appointing Deng Shihan as the director. Personnel have been sent to Guangxi to recruit new soldiers, who will be transported to Fujian in batches and trained at the center before being assigned to various units to strengthen their forces.

<p>Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian</p>
<h3>Three Provinces Expand Military Strength</h3>
<p>Guangxi Province Increases the 8th Army</p>
<p>Guangdong Province Increases Training Regiment</p>
<p>19th Route Army Expands Two Divisions</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since the ceasefire in North China, the southwestern provinces have paid close attention to the suppression of communists in Jiangxi Province. The two regiments of Gui Army, led by Tan Lianfang's division and Ling Long, which entered Guangdong, have diverted to Sannan in Jiangxi through northern Guangdong to increase the strength of the communist suppression. The Guangxi provincial authorities, since Ling Long’s two regiments have been transferred to Jiangxi, and Liang Jin and Su Xinmin's two regiments have also been concentrated in Wuzhou, awaiting orders for transfer. Considering that if all of Tan's troops leave Guangxi, the original military strength would inevitably be reduced, in addition to actively training the air force, it is planned to expand the army by one more army, restoring the former name of the 8th Army. The position of army commander is planned to be filled by Li Pinxian, the former commander of the 8th Army. At the same time, there is a rumor that Guangxi Provincial Chairman Huang Xuchu will return to the position of commander of the 15th Army. On the Guangdong side, the independent 4th Division was recently expanded and concentrated in the Shaoguan area. Recently, there has been news of its transfer to Jiangxi for communist suppression. In order to strengthen its forces, the division plans to add a training regiment. In addition, the 19th Route Army Anti-Japanese Vanguard Team, although nominally two columns, actually only has four regiments. The two columns have recently crossed the Heyuan River and are returning to Fujian at full speed. They are expected to arrive in Yongding by the 25th of this month. In the future, they may be ordered to enter Jiangxi to assist in communist suppression. Cai Tingkai, Commander of the 19th Route Army, in order to increase the strength of the communist suppression, has expanded the two columns into two divisions, named the Independent 1st and 2nd Divisions of the 19th Route Army. Zhang Yan and Tan Qixiu will serve as division commanders, and three special service regiments have been formed in Fujian, with Li Jinbo, Situ Fei, and Sun Jingqing as the special service regiment commanders. The expansion of Zhang and Tan's two columns is a merger with the old troops of Zhang Zhen, the former Fujian army. At the same time, the deficits will be made up by the army's office in Guangdong sending personnel to recruit soldiers in Guangdong. More than 300 new soldiers have been recruited in the Gaolei area, and more than 200 have been recruited in the Heyuan Longchuan area. A company commander was sent to lead them back to Xiamen first to await the replenishment of the two divisions. It is heard that the two independent divisions are adopting the Army B-type organization. (June 20th)</p>

<h3>Two Cotton Mills Suspend Operations</h3>
<p>Reason is Significant Losses</p>
<p>Workers Still Demand Resumption of Work</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Wuhan's industry has always been dominated by the textile industry. Recently, affected by the dumping of foreign goods and the unrest in the countryside, the purchasing power in the inland areas is weak, and the future looks bleak. Except for Yuhua, which has relatively strong capital and can barely support itself, the other mills, including the First Cotton Mill, Zhenhuan Cotton Mill, and Minsheng Cotton Mill, have all undergone layoffs and salary reductions. After a few days, Zhenhuan declared a temporary suspension of operations for reorganization and liquidation. At that time, a contract was signed with the workers to resume work on a scheduled date. Unexpectedly, this was barely over, and now the First Cotton Mill has announced a suspension of operations due to stagnant yarn sales and economic disruption. At the same time, Zhenhuan Mill also announced its closure due to the results of the liquidation, with assets and liabilities unable to meet, and almost all of its capital lost. It can be seen that Wuhan's industry and commerce are declining. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>The First Cotton Mill's capital was weak from the beginning of its establishment, relying entirely on loans for turnover. During the Communist Party incident in 1927, the original capital suffered significant losses and operations ceased for two years. In April 1929, after consultation between shareholders and creditors, it borrowed 600,000 yuan from the Zhejiang Industrial Bank as a restart fund. At the same time, it was negotiated that Arnhold &amp; Co. would borrow an additional 1.5 million taels of warehouse loan silver for operations. After restarting, business was sluggish. As of the end of June, the total losses were more than 1.055 million yuan, exceeding the amount of the restart fund borrowed. Subsequently, it was supported by borrowing. Since July of last year, it has been affected by the dumping of Japanese goods, frequent declines in yarn prices, rural bankruptcy, weak purchasing power, and blocked roads. The yarn and cloth market has plummeted. The factory currently has more than 10,000 bales of cotton yarn and 150,000 bolts of cotton cloth in stock. The accumulation of inventory and the increasing losses have resulted in losses of more than 1.1 million yuan from July of last year to May of this year, totaling 2.1 million yuan. In addition, the amount of warehouse pledges borrowed has reached more than 5.5 million yuan, more than double the original loan amount. Therefore, it had to announce the suspension of operations and has reported to the competent authorities for record. About seven or eight thousand male and female workers in the factory have also declared unemployment.</p>
<p>On the Zhenhuan side, losses were also reported. In May of this year, it reported to the competent authorities for approval to cease and liquidate. Subsequently, the Provincial Government's Construction Committee sent representatives to jointly determine a contract with labor and management, setting a deadline of July 15 for resuming work. The company then submitted a request to the Wuchang District Court in accordance with the contract and the Company Law for legal adjudication and appointed a liquidator to establish a liquidation office. The liquidators found that the company's original capital of 1.22 million taels had been lost by more than 900,000 taels. Other assets such as machinery and buildings were purchased for more than 2 million taels, but its debts were still as high as more than 3 million taels. The two were insufficient, and it was declared bankrupt in accordance with the Company Law and could not continue to operate. The company has reported to the competent authorities for record. As for the workers' original 40% subsidy, it will still be issued until July 14.</p>
<p>As for the workers, the Wuchang Textile Industry Workers' Union, due to the suspension of the First Cotton Mill, separately submitted requests to the party and government agencies, earnestly requesting the company to resume work on a scheduled date. Regarding the closure of Zhenhuan, a separate memorandum was submitted requesting the Construction Department to strictly order the company to fulfill the contract signed in May and start work as scheduled to maintain the workers' livelihood.

<h3>Three Provinces Open Highway to Traffic</h3>
<p>Total Length Over Eight Hundred Li</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: This time, the construction of the Jing-Wu and Xuan-Chang highways in Jiangsu, Anhui, and Zhejiang is very important for land transportation in the three provinces. In addition to the three provinces sharing the cost of the two roads, the National Economic Commission also provided subsidies. The details are: (A) Jing-Wu Road, (1) Jiangsu section, from De'an Gate in Nanjing to the southern border of Jiangsu, Tongjing Town, 31 kilometers long, construction cost of more than 100,000 yuan, 30,000 yuan assisted by the Economic Commission, (2) Anhui section, from the Jiangsu border to</p>

<p>Wuhu City, 54 kilometers long, construction cost of more than 430,000 yuan, 138,000 yuan assisted by the Economic Commission, (B) Xuan-Chang Road, (1) Anhui section, from Xuancheng to Jiepai Town, 86 kilometers long, construction cost of 480,000 yuan, 150,000 yuan assisted by the Commission, (2) Zhejiang section, from the Anhui border to Zhejiang Changxing, 38 kilometers long, construction cost of more than 194,000 yuan, 62,000 yuan assisted by the Economic Commission, plus the 3 kilometers in Nanjing are not included. Therefore, this time the invitation was jointly issued by five agencies: the Economic Commission, the construction departments of the three provinces, and the Nanjing Municipal Government. On the 24th, the Jing-Wu highway opening ceremony was held under Yuhuatai in Nanjing. At 10:00 AM, more than 200 guests took more than 20 private and public cars to Wuhu. The Jiangsu section is a macadam road surface, and the Anhui section is a gravel road, which is very smooth. Arriving at Dangtu, the cars were loaded onto ferries to cross the Shuiyang River, and they arrived in Wuhu at 2:00 PM. Liu Yiyan, Director of the Anhui Provincial Construction Department, hosted a Western-style lunch for the guests at the Cuiwen Christian Middle School. At 4:00 PM, they continued to Xuancheng. The route passed through the earth base of the old Wuguang Railway, and the number of iron bridges was very large, and the height was extremely high, making the car ride seem very dangerous. They arrived in Xuancheng at about 7:00 PM. On the morning of the 25th, the Xuan-Chang highway opening ceremony was held. They departed at 8:00 AM, mostly on dirt roads. At 10:00 AM, they crossed Jiedu, and the returning cars turned back. The Zhejiang Highway Bureau sent 10 cars to meet the guests at the ferry. At 12:00 PM, the Highway Bureau hosted a luncheon at the station. At 1:30 PM, guests were sent back to Nanjing or Hangzhou for sightseeing by special cars of the Zhejiang Highway Bureau. More than 200 people went to Wuhu on this trip, and more than 100 people went to Xuancheng and Changxing. Half of them returned to Nanjing and the other half went to Hangzhou. Wu Zhihui and Liu Yiyan returned to Nanjing together in the original car. The reporter originally planned to get off in Jurong and transfer to Zhenjiang, but it was already after 6 o'clock, so he went to Nanjing and took a night train back. The round trip route formed a semi-circular ring, totaling 105 li from Nanjing to Wuhu, about 58 li from Wuhu to Xuancheng, 124 li from Xuancheng to Zi, and 200 li from Chang to Nanjing, totaling 487 kilometers, or more than 800 li in Chinese miles.

<h3>High Court Ruling on Songjiang Bank Bankruptcy Case</h3>
<p>In the Songjiang Bank bankruptcy case, the creditor representative, Bai Guanlan, etc., dissatisfied with the first instance judgment, convened a general meeting of creditors after receiving the judgment and decided to appeal and share the litigation costs. Those creditors who did not attend were notified by newspaper advertisement, and those who still did not pay were treated as giving up the appeal. The reasons for not accepting the first instance judgment were drafted and submitted to the Suzhou Higher Court. It is now learned that the Higher Court has sent a ruling to Songjiang, requiring that the litigation costs of this case be calculated and 808.5 yuan be paid in foreign currency. The full amount must be paid within fifteen days from the date of receipt of the ruling in order to review the case, otherwise it will be rejected. It is heard that the creditor representative, Bai Guan, will compile a list of the creditors he represents and submit a statement to Suzhou, stating that the creditors not listed are not included in the appeal because they have been notified by newspaper advertisement but have not paid the litigation costs.</p>

<h3>Rising Water Levels Worry Farmers</h3>
<p>The terrain of this county is low-lying and the soil is sticky, which is suitable for planting rice seedlings. The terrain of the whole county is higher in the southeast than in the northwest. Therefore, most of the southeast townships have high fields, with summer wheat and autumn rice, which can be harvested twice a year. Most of the northwest corner has polder fields, which are harvested once a year, and some are harvested twice a year. Every time there is a year with high water, water accumulates into pools, or all are lost, even in a major flood like the one that happens every twenty years, even the seeds are not harvested, and the farmers are miserable and indescribable. There has been too much rainfall this summer, and the water level is already higher than last year. Farmers are worried about a flood. Since the beginning of the plum rain season, it has been overcast and rainy for days. In the lowest areas, the river water is almost level with the fields. Farmers are even more panicked. On the 21st and 22nd of this month, the weather was cold, and floods were suddenly reported in Zhejiang and Hubei provinces. Farmers in Xidi also feared that the flood was imminent, so they took preventive measures. On the next day, the river water suddenly rose by an inch. The farmers were deeply afraid that the water would increase again without rain and were greatly uneasy. However, on the 24th, although the weather was hot and there was no sign of rain, the river water did not recede because the water level upstream was higher than in Xidi.</p>

<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Petitions the Government to</h3>
<p>Actively Plan to Recover Lost Territories</p>
<p>Military and Diplomatic Efforts Have Both Reached Dead Ends</p>
<p>The Situation Will Be Completely Different in a Few Decades</p>
<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce, based on the resolutions of the Fourth Member Representative Assembly, petitioned the government the other day to actively plan the recovery of lost territories. The original petition stated: "Regarding the matter of petitioning, since the fall of the three northeastern provinces and the subsequent loss of Rehe, the Central Government and the North China armies have joined forces to resist at various passes of the Great Wall. Due to the unfavorable situation, they reluctantly concluded the Tanggu Truce Agreement to end the conflict. However, the provinces of Hebei have been half-occupied, and Eastern Hebei has not been recovered. In terms of recovering lost territories by force, it is already unlikely. As for relying on diplomacy, the League of Nations has not been heard to have taken any action during the fierce battles in Hebei and Rehe provinces. It seems that the case of Japan's occupation of the Northeast has long been dismissed and not discussed. To excuse themselves, they temporarily use the denial of Manchukuo as a tactic. The London Economic Conference gathered representatives from various countries, seemingly providing an opportunity to use diplomatic means. However, the scope of the conference is limited, and the Japanese, as well as Europe and the United States, are doing everything possible to avoid political issues in the Far East. From a superficial observation, both relying on military force and relying on diplomacy have reached dead ends. The longer the time, the more solid the foundation of Japanese operations will become. With full wings, it will be even more difficult to replicate. It will also advance to covet the Northwest and peep into the Central Plains. Current opinion is that the recovery of lost territories will be expected decades later, and the situation will be completely different, like a daydream. The association is terrified when it thinks about this. Therefore, at the Fourth Member Representative Assembly on June 25, based on the proposal submitted by the Egg Industry Association, we resolved to actively plan the recovery of lost territories. Please submit to your esteemed government (executive branch) for review and approval, and to handle the matter in a way that benefits the public." Respectfully submitted to the National Government, the Executive Yuan.</p>

<p>Baoshan County Requests Funds</p>
<h3>To Repair Wusong Seawall</h3>
<p>More than Half of the Seawall Has Collapsed</p>
<p>Autumn Floods Are Likely to Cause Breaches</p>
<p>In the past few days, the plum rains have been continuous, the weather has been gloomy, and the water levels in the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River have risen sharply. Outside Wusong, due to continuous rain and a sudden rise in the tide, the coastal seawalls have been dangerously battered by huge waves. After inspecting the dangerous situation of the seawalls, Baoshan County Magistrate Jin Qingzhang telegraphed the Provincial Government to quickly allocate large funds to carry out emergency repairs. Regarding the importance of this matter, a reporter from Dagongshe went to the Baoshan County Government yesterday morning to meet with County Magistrate Jin and inquire about the detailed situation of the seawall's danger and the local authorities' flood prevention measures. County Magistrate Jin happened to be slightly ill yesterday and could not see guests, so he was received by Zhu Chun, the representative of the First Section. According to Mr. Zhu, the seawalls along the northwest Baoshan area outside Wusong had once flooded in the autumn of 1931. At that time, the Jiangnan Seawall Engineering Bureau ordered the responsible engineering office to carry out emergency repairs to eliminate the danger. However, the emergency repairs are now collapsing again. County Magistrate Jin inspected the site the other day and found that the sandbags along the embankment at Gulongdun, Zhangjiazhai, Shidong, and Beiwangmiao were mostly rotten, the soil was gradually sinking, and the situation was extremely dangerous, with the danger imminent. In the past few days, due to continuous rain and high tides, the seawalls have been further eroded and collapsed by waves. County Magistrate Jin stated that if repairs could be carried out as soon as possible, a major disaster would not occur. If the matter is delayed further, the autumn floods will arrive in an instant. Once huge waves strike, breaches can be expected immediately. Those who suffer will extend to dozens of counties, and the disaster will be unimaginable. Therefore, he has successively reported to the Provincial Government's Department of Construction, stating the dangerous situation of the seawalls, and submitted a construction plan, requesting a quick allocation of funds for repairs. The estimated cost of repairs is about 120,000 yuan. At present, the Provincial Government has not yet approved it. Fortunately, the weather has cleared up in recent days, the tide has receded, and the danger has been slightly reduced, but it is hoped that the funds will be allocated before the autumn floods and repairs will be carried out to avoid collapse and protect the lives and property of the people. The incoming and outgoing telegrams of County Magistrate Jin's report on the dangerous situation of the seawalls, the Department of Construction of Jiangsu ordered the preparation of a plan and budget, and County Magistrate Jin's preparation of a construction plan are compiled below.</p>
<h3>Baoshan County's Submission</h3>
<p>Baoshan County Magistrate Jin Qingzhang's submission to the Jiangsu Provincial Government and Department of Construction stated: "Regarding the report of the dangerous situation of the seawalls and the request for a quick allocation of funds to prevent floods in the autumn and protect the lives and property of the people. The Zhangjiazhai and Shidong wing project and the northern head project of this county are extremely dangerous and have been reported to your esteemed government (department) for</p>
<p>allocation of funds for repairs. We have received instructions that the provincial treasury is in a state of extreme poverty and no funds can be allocated. All the projects will have to wait until the counties have raised funds and a solution has been decided before a unified plan for construction can be drawn up. The county magistrate believes that this matter is of great importance. Since the request for allocation of funds for repairs has not been approved, and the extent of the danger of the project and the possibility of delaying it must be understood by on-site inspection, he brought Patrol Officer Bao Wei to the seawall on May 26 for a section-by-section inspection. It was found that the emergency repairs of the autumn of 1931 at Gulongdun, Zhangjiazhai, Shidong, and Beiwangmiao were mostly rotten, the soil was gradually sinking, and there were extremely dangerous gaps at Zhangjiazhai (over 400 feet) and Shidong (over 300 feet). Other sections also had faint signs of similar conditions. In addition, the mud wall project at Beiwangmiao was leaning outward, with the 306-foot section inside being the most severe. There was also a large breach of 275 feet in the old seawall in the third section of Gulongdun, with only 11 to 13 feet of the seawall surface remaining. The old seawall at Zhangjiazhai (over 500 feet) was also severely collapsed, with two breaches, one 17 feet wide with only 10 feet of the seawall surface remaining, and one 31 feet wide with only 13 feet of the seawall surface remaining. Based on this situation, the danger is already extreme, and the situation is imminent. However, if repairs can be carried out as soon as possible, a major disaster will not occur. If the matter is delayed further, the dangerous situation will inevitably increase day by day and cannot be avoided. Moreover, the autumn floods are approaching in an instant. Once huge waves strike, breaches can be expected immediately. Those who suffer will extend to dozens of counties, and the disaster will be unimaginable. In addition to submitting a separate construction plan and budget, the reason for reporting the dangerous situation of the seawall and requesting a quick allocation of funds to prevent floods in the autumn and protect the lives and property of the people is submitted for your review and guidance."</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government Telegram</h3>
<p>Chairman Gu of the Jiangsu Provincial Government and Director Dong of the Department of Construction telegraphed in reply to County Magistrate Jin, saying: To County Magistrate Jin of Shi Shan County: Your submitted report regarding the dangerous situation of the sea dikes after inspection, requesting prompt allocation of funds to prevent accidents, etc., has been noted. Upon investigation, the Hai Tang, Zhangjiazhai, Beishidong, and Yanchibeishou dangerous works in your county were previously ordered by this government to allocate funds from the road construction mu (unit of area) donation item for planning and construction and report back. Now, according to your report regarding the dangerous situation of the sea dikes after inspection, it is crucial and urgent to take preventive measures. The required funds should be allocated from the road construction mu donation item in your county in accordance with the previous order for repair. A plan and budget should be prepared and submitted for review, and you should supervise and inspect the dikes at all times without any negligence. Chairman Gu, Director Dong of the Department of Construction, sealed.</p>
<h3>County Magistrate Jin's Second Report</h3>
<p>County Magistrate Jin Qingzhang of Baoshan County again reported to the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Department of Construction, saying: Reporting to submit the planned diagrams for the sea dike project, together with the plan diagrams, etc., requesting review and approval and prompt allocation of funds for repair. According to the instructions of the Provincial Government Construction Order No. 436, it was stated that after investigation, the Beishidong Yanchibeishou dangerous section of the sea dike in your county, measuring 125 zhang (unit of length), was confirmed by the Department of Construction as truly dangerous and in urgent need of repair. In October of last year, Yan Fenglou, the head of Huiyuan Township in the fifth district of the county, and Wan Kaijia, the director of the Baoshan section of the Jiangnan Sea Dike Works Office, successively requested allocation of funds for repair. Considering that such projects are not limited to one location and the total required funds are estimated to be substantial, this government, due to empty coffers, was unable to carry out this project, which was a temporary and unavoidable measure. Now, the Jiangnan Sea Dike expenses have been ordered to be covered by the county and the three counties of Tai, Song, and Chang from the county's construction expenses. The aforementioned Beishidong Yanchibeishou sea dike project, being dangerous, should be undertaken in advance. It is hereby ordered that the county magistrate comply and promptly allocate funds from the road construction mu donation item in your county for planning and construction and report back for review. This is of utmost importance, etc. Upon receiving this, it was found that the dangerous sections of the sea dike in the county that need repair are not limited to the Shidong Yanchibeishou section. Other sections such as the first, second, and third sections of Gulongdun, the third section of Zhangjiazhai, and the first section of Xuejiatan are all at risk of danger at any time. In addition, the slanting portion of the Shidong cement dike also shows a tendency to collapse outward. The urgency of the rescue does not allow for delay. The county magistrate has reported to your government (department) regarding the dangerous conditions of the sea dikes after inspection and requested prompt allocation of funds to prevent accidents during the autumn floods. Now, after detailed planning by the county magistrate, it is proposed to repair and reinforce the dangerous works of the first, second, and third sections of Gujiangdun, measuring 470 meters, the first section of Xuejiatan, measuring 92 meters, Zhangjiazhai, measuring 320 meters, Shidong Yanchibeishou, measuring 381 meters (originally 125 zhang), and to construct the second stone project. In addition, the slanting portion of the Shidong cement dike, measuring 122 meters, will undergo supplementary construction, totaling 1385 meters in length. The estimated cost of labor and materials is 121,249.43 yuan. After deducting the value of materials transferred and stored by the former Sea Dike Works Office, amounting to 19,089 yuan, the actual required cost of labor and materials is 108,30.13 yuan. As for the Shidong Yanchibeishou project, it was ordered to allocate funds from the road construction mu donation item in this county for repair. The Transportation Affairs Office reported that sea dike projects require large funds and have historically been funded by the national treasury or provincial treasury, and cannot be funded by a small amount of local public funds. As of May of this year, the accumulated funds for road construction amounted to only 4,380.3 yuan, including 2,000 yuan deposited in the Shiyou pawnshop. Due to the liquidation period of the pawnshop, it cannot be withdrawn temporarily. The office needs to retain funds to repay debts, pay interest, and for other annual road and bridge repairs. The existing withdrawable funds are only over 2,000 yuan, which is insufficient for road and bridge repairs, debt repayment, and interest payment. Furthermore, according to the annual reports of the Tanggong Bureau on the use of funds for sea dike projects in this county, the annual expenditure reaches 160,000 to 170,000 yuan, which cannot be covered by a small amount of mu donations. It is requested to forward the report to the provincial department and seek additional funds for repair to alleviate the urgent need. Upon investigation, the county's local finances have almost gone bankrupt since the war. Such a large project cannot be covered by a small amount of road construction mu donations. The period of autumn floods is approaching, and if preparations are not made in advance, a collapse is to be feared. Therefore, I dare to sincerely plead for instructions and submit the planned diagrams and estimated tables for each dangerous section, requesting review and approval, and prompt allocation of funds for repair to protect the lives, property, and fields of the people. I await orders with trepidation.</p>
<p>City Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed the Ministry of Finance</p>
<h3>Correcting Stamp Duty Penalties</h3>
<p>Stamp Duty Falling Off Should Not Be Falsely Penalized</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the Taxation Department yesterday, requesting correction of stamp duty penalties. The original text reads: To the Nanjing Ministry of Finance and the Taxation Department: On the 225th of this month, we received a letter from the Hua Cheng Textile Canvas Factory, stating that the factory received a summons from the First Special District Local Court on the 15th of this month. The reason for the summons was that the factory failed to affix stamp duty to two invoices for goods sold on April 27th and 28th of this year. The trial was scheduled for 9:00 AM on the 23rd of this month. When the factory attended the court for trial, the Stamp Duty Bureau also sent personnel to court, claiming that the factory had evaded stamp duty. The court presented two invoices for review. The invoice issued on the 28th had already been affixed with stamp duty, but it had fallen off after a long time. However, the glue residue of the used stamp and half of the character 'Cheng' from the vermilion nipping seal with regular script woodblock 'Hua Cheng' were clearly visible. It was easy to defend this. The factory immediately stated that it was innocent. The Stamp Duty Bureau rose to object, saying that regardless of whether the stamp fell off or not, it should be treated as if it had not been affixed. The court immediately ruled that the two invoices without stamp duty should be fined 10 yuan each, totaling 20 yuan. After hearing the verdict, the factory wanted to request the court to review whether the invoice had been affixed with stamp duty, but the presiding judge showed anger and prohibited speaking with a stern attitude, as if indicating that he believed the statement of the Stamp Duty Bureau personnel and considered it an iron case. This kind of autocratic judgment was unexpectedly replayed under the clear sky and bright sun. Our factory purchases stamp duty tickets worth about 40 yuan per year, as evidenced by the account books of previous years. As for the stamp falling off after being affixed, it is impossible for merchants to keep it safe. If the invoice is taken away by the customer, the affixed stamp will be folded and turned, making it impossible to keep it from falling off. Once it falls off, and the Stamp Duty Bureau considers it necessary to punish, equating it with not affixing, not only is there no such provision in the Stamp Duty Regulations, but it is also unreasonable and illegal. If the Stamp Duty Bureau's claim that anyone who has affixed a stamp but it falls off, even if there are clear traces and nipping marks, is the same as tax evasion, this precedent will open the door for cunning people to extort money, and innocent merchants will suffer endlessly. Therefore, we sincerely request your association to uphold justice and appeal to the relevant bureaus and offices of stamp duty to request a stop to this harsh penalty. Not only will our factory be fortunate, but it will also be a great blessing for merchants across the country, etc. Upon arrival at the association, it was found that Article 5 of the Stamp Duty Regulations only has provisions for penalties for missing stamps, insufficient stamps, or stamps affixed but not stamped. As for those who affix stamps according to regulations and they fall off after a long time, but there are stamping marks on the adhesive place, it cannot be compared with missing stamps. The regulations do not have clear provisions for penalties. Moreover, the invoice is given to the customer at the time of the transaction. Once it is in the hands of others, how can it be guaranteed? The affixer cannot ask about it. Therefore, it is unreasonable and illegal to punish the stamp falling off as tax evasion. Once this precedent is set, it will only open the door to extortion. Recently, the inspection offices have often made unreasonable demands regarding stamp duty incidents in the concessions, and merchants are all indignant. Although this case is trivial, if this kind of claim becomes a precedent, merchants will not be able to bear the suffering. Your ministry (department) has the responsibility to correct the illegal and harsh demands of the inspection office. We hereby urgently request your review and implementation to avoid opening bad precedents and causing disturbances. Respectfully, the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<p>Representatives from various district branches of the Civil Union including the 5th, 6th, 7th, 10th, 15th, 26th, 29th, 31st, 32nd, etc., and various road business federations including Yuezhou Road, Jiaxing Road, Broadway Road, Sichuan Road, East and West Huade Road, Yangshupu Road, Haining Road, Avenue Edward VII, Hansin Road, North Xizang Road, Suzhou Road, North Jiangxi Road, North Sichuan Road, Chuanbao Road, Caojiadu, etc., including Liu Zhongying, Zhou Fuzhang, Zheng Dongshan, Wang Jian'e, Zhu Zhichun, Zhu Baoluo, Qiu Jiaju, Zhang Yumen, Wang Rongtang, Fei Liangheng, Hu Changyong, Chen Jiufeng, Guan Jichuan, Wei Langxuan, Hu Zhaomei, Ye Qichang, Shen Hefu, and over fifty others.</p>
<h3>Meeting Details</h3>
<p>Wang Jian'e, Liu Zhongying, and Chen Jiufeng were elected as the presidium, and Zheng Dongshan was the recording secretary. The chairman first reported the purpose of convening the joint meeting. Then, Wei Langxuan, the representative of the 25th District Branch, reported on the situation of the shops in the district requesting the municipal government to postpone taxation, stating that it was not an act of resisting donations, and requested the district branches to do their best to assist. The following assistance methods were immediately decided upon: (A) Send a letter to the Municipal Council to uphold justice. (B) Submit a petition to the central government to punish the director of the Public Security Bureau for improper measures and remove and investigate the director of the Fifth District Second Branch. (C) Refute the remarks of Cai Zengji, the director of the Finance Bureau. (D) Jointly petition the Civil Union to argue based on reason. (E) Oppose the collection of donations and insist to the end before obtaining guarantees. In addition to notifying the citizens of the district, a declaration will be issued.</p>
<h3>Petition to the Council</h3>
<p>Respected President Shi of the Municipal Council of this city: We respectfully submit this petition. The recent strike of shops on North Sichuan Road was caused by the illegal arrest and detention by the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Fortunately, in order to take the overall situation into consideration, they followed the advice of the Civil Union and resumed business first. Otherwise, at this time after the war, when recovery has not yet stabilized and the economy is declining, what would the future hold? It is recently heard that the Municipal Council intends to add the crime of inciting and instigating to the citizens, which will only complicate matters further. How can the hearts of the people be convinced? Our association is driven by the overall public security and justice, and cannot remain silent. We dare to elaborate to your council. Rights and obligations are inherently reciprocal. Citizens have the obligation to pay taxes and should enjoy the right to protection. The dispute over the extraterritorial road construction in the area where Chinese and foreigners reside has been unresolved for a long time. Chinese merchants often suffer from foreign bullying and have no way to appeal. Where is the protection? This is the first point. Residents in the city enjoy the same rights with respect to municipal administration. The obligation to pay taxes should be the same, and there should be no exceptions based on nationality. However, the municipal government's announcement only applies to Chinese citizens and not others, which seems unfair. This is the second point. Our country's territory is being encroached upon by others to create abnormal phenomena. The municipal government does not seek a thorough solution from the root, resulting in inconsistent powers and possible foreign threats. The residents of the area are fearful about the security and whether the payment of taxes will not be duplicated. This is the third point. All of these factors are sufficient to cause residents to worry. Therefore, the request to postpone taxation is not a resistance to donations. Whether this request can be granted, the municipal government should give a reply. However, before a formal reply has been given, they abruptly arrested and detained people for three days, which is a clear violation of the law. Current laws pay attention to the health of serious prisoners. However, not only is the illegal detention of innocent citizens insufficient, but they are also deprived of food, which is inhumane. Illegal and excessive power will deprive citizens of protection. Your council is the highest body of the citizens of this city and has the responsibility to supervise and correct the mistakes of the municipal government. Therefore, we jointly appeal, hoping that you will uphold justice and handle the matter according to law. This is a matter of public concern.</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Awaits the Ministry of Industry's Reply Before</p>
<h3>Continuing Discussion on Factory Inspection</h3>
<p>The Board of Directors of the Public Works Department Will Adjourn in Early August</p>
<p>The Factory Inspection Case in the Concession Will Be Resolved Promptly</p>
<p>Guo Wen News Agency reports that the issue of inspecting factories in the Public Concession, after two preliminary discussions between Municipal Government Secretary-General Yu Hongjun and Public Works Department Director-General Fessenden, detailed methods have been drafted separately and sent by the Municipal Government to the Ministry of Industry, where they were handed over to the Labor Department for study. The results of the study have been submitted to Minister Chen Gongbo and will be replied to the Municipal Government in the coming days. Public Works Department Director-General Fessenden reported the consultation process to the Board of Directors last week. Reporters learned from relevant sources yesterday that the Public Works Department will adjourn for a summer break in early August. Before the adjournment, the factory inspection issue will be brought to a close as soon as possible. The Board of Directors of the Public Works Department has long been clear about the principles and methods of the issue, so the last meeting only listened to Fessenden's report without further discussion. Therefore, after the Municipal Government receives the reply from the Ministry of Industry, Yu and Fessenden will meet again to continue discussing and resolving the detailed methods.</p>
<h3>Hankou Water Level Decreased by One Inch</h3>
<p>Although the Weather Was Cloudy and Rainy Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>47 Feet 2 Inches</p>
<p>A Flood Disaster Can Be Avoided</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the Engineering Department of the National Economic Commission received a radio report from the Jianghan Engineering Bureau stating that at 9:00 AM yesterday (the 26th), the weather in Hankou was cloudy and rainy, and the water level was 47.2 feet. The water level in Hankou at 6:00 PM on the 25th was 47.3 feet. This confirms that it has decreased by one inch yesterday. If it does not rise again in the future, a major flood disaster can be avoided.</p>
<p>New Currency Issued on a Scheduled Date</p>
<h3>Review Committee Established an Office Yesterday</h3>
<p>Address on the Second Floor of the Central Mint</p>
<p>Temporarily Invited Grandel to Serve as Assayer</p>
<p>New Voice News Agency reports that the Ministry of Finance announced that the new currency minted by the Central Mint will be issued starting July 1st. All public and private payments and receipts and all transactions will be carried out in a unified manner. The Review Committee established an office yesterday and temporarily hired Grandel, the currency system advisor of the Ministry of Finance, to serve as the assayer to ensure compliance with the legal standard. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Establishment of Office</h3>
<p>The Review Committee decided at its second standing meeting that secretarial affairs would be temporarily handled by the secretary of the Central Bank. Now, due to the imminent issuance of the new currency, it has been decided to establish an office located on the second floor of the Central Mint in West Shanghai. It officially began operations yesterday, with hours from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. It is also planned to hire Mr. Qiao as the secretary. Before the hiring, it will be temporarily represented by Secretary Li of the Central Bank Secretariat. Secretary Li arrived at the office yesterday and began working.</p>
<h3>Hiring of Assayer</h3>
<p>The Review Committee has entrusted a non-official assay by local assaying agencies for the new currency minted by the mint. As a result, it is in compliance with the legal standard of fineness and weight. Now, the name of Mr. Grandel, an American currency system expert, has been confirmed as the currency system advisor of the Ministry of Finance. Therefore, it has been decided to temporarily invite Grandel to serve as the assayer before the assayer is hired. Mr. Grandel has begun assaying after accepting the invitation.</p>
<h3>Announcement of Results</h3>
<p>The Central Mint will temporarily store the new currency that meets the legal standard of fineness and weight in the factory warehouse. After the Review Committee affixes a certificate of approval on the boxes, it will be issued. As for the 2 million pieces minted with the old mold, it has been decided to remint them with the new mold. The Review Committee originally scheduled the issuance for July 1st and planned to announce the results of the assay before July 1st to demonstrate great credibility. According to the Review Committee Office yesterday, the issuance is scheduled for the 1st. If all procedures can be fully completed by then, the issuance will be carried out as scheduled. Otherwise, it may be postponed. At around 11:00 AM yesterday, Mint Director Lu Xuepu visited Review Committee Chairman Kong Xiangxi to discuss preparations before the issuance on July 1st.</p>
<h3>Old Currency in Circulation</h3>
<p>After the issuance of the new currency, the old currency will continue to circulate as usual. As for old Chinese currencies such as the dragon dollar and foreign silver dollars, they have been melted down because they have slightly better fineness. The most widely circulated currency in the market now is the Sun Yat-sen dollar, followed by the Yuan Shikai dollar. Shanghai is a financial center with approximately 120 million yuan in storage. The total storage in the country is over 200 million yuan. After the issuance of the new currency, merchants can exchange their existing silver dollars that meet the original weight and fineness for silver standard currency of the same amount in accordance with the regulations of the standard currency minting regulations, without paying minting fees.</p>
<p>The Anti-War Association Telegraphed Liu Wenhui</p>
<p>Please Respect Public Opinion and Genuinely Cease Fire</p>
<p>The General Assembly of the Anti-Civil War League received a telegram from Deputy Commander Deng Xihou, transferred by the 14th Route Commander's Office in Shanghai, stating that Liu Wenhui was insincere and had not complied with the central government's clear order to cease fire. After receiving the telegram, the Anti-War Association immediately telegraphed Liu Wenhui, urging him to genuinely cease fire, stating that otherwise, according to public opinion, he would be punished in the same way as Liu Xiang. The original texts of the two telegrams are as follows:</p>
<h3>Telegram from Deng</h3>
<p>To the General Assembly of the Anti-Civil War League in Shanghai: We have received your telegram and deeply appreciate your clear understanding of the situation and fairness. Upon receiving the central government's telegram ordering a ceasefire and a return to original defenses, Xihou immediately ordered the frontline to cease military action and prepare to return to defense. However, Liu Wenhui is insincere and nominally declares a ceasefire to deceive the central government and various sectors inside and outside the province, but in reality, he is actively attacking and has not stopped to this day. We again ask the General Assembly to uphold justice and condemn and punish him. Deng Xihou bows.</p>
<h3>Telegram to Liu</h3>
<p>To Military Governor Liu Wenhui in Chengdu: According to reports, you are insincere about the ceasefire, which is deeply disappointing. Please genuinely cease fire and return to your original defenses. Otherwise, according to public opinion, this association will punish you in the same way as Liu Xiang. The General Assembly of the Anti-Civil War League bows. You.</p>

<h3>Yixing Cargo Ship Encountered Danger in Hankou</h3>
<p>Cargo Loaded Has Been Shipped to Shanghai by Another Ship</p>
<p>The Ship Will Be Towed to Shanghai for Dock Repair</p>
<p>New Voice News Agency reports that the Yichang cargo ship on the Shanghai-Yixing line of the American Jiejiang Shipping Company lost its steering ability due to the tide at the Hankou Wharf on the 24th of this month, mistakenly collided with the Sanbei Qinghai ship, and hit the riverside reef, causing damage. The goods have arrived in Shanghai and will be repaired in the dock. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Sudden Tide Accident</h3>
<p>The Yixing ship specializes in the Shanghai-Yixing line, with a load capacity of 350 tons, and is a shallow-water cargo ship. The shipowner, the American Mr. E.S. Smith, sailed from Yichang to Shanghai on the 22nd, fully loaded with 1,500 packages of miscellaneous grains (wheat) in Shashi. At 12:00 noon on the 24th, when arriving in Hankou, the ship was preparing to dock. The Yangtze River was high tide and the ship lost its steering ability due to lake water impact. Qinghai Ship of Sanbei Shipping Company was docked next to it. This caused Yixing Ship to crash into Qinghai Ship. The captain urgently wanted to avoid causing the ship to crash into the reef on the riverside.</p>
<h3>Bottom Pierced</h3>
<p>After the Yixing ship mistakenly crashed into the Qinghai ship, the propeller was damaged. When the Yixing ship hit the riverside reef, the bottom of the ship's main cabin was pierced with a hole causing seawater to rush in. The captain immediately sounded the alarm for help. Luckily, after being warned at noon, the Hankou branch dispatched a barge to rescue it. The punctured point was not badly damaged. However, the wheat in the main cabin was water damaged. At the same time, the Yixing ship was parked at the dock.</p>
<h3>Company Rescue</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Company was the first to get a telegram, knowing that it had hit a reef, and immediately telegraphed the Hankou branch to quickly find a way to rescue it. Following this, another telegram was received stating that the ship had hit a riverside reef and was out of danger. The company then dispatched the Yi Ping Ship in Hankou to find a way to tow the Yixing Ship back to Shanghai for repairs at the shipyard.</p>
<h3>Cargo Has Arrived in Shanghai</h3>
<p>After receiving the Shanghai reply telegram, the Hankou branch immediately transferred 1,500 packages of miscellaneous wheat from Yixing Ship to its Tai Qi ship which was sailing to Shanghai from Chongqing. Because Tai Qi Ship had already been loaded with cargo it could not fully accommodate the cargo. The cargo was transferred to Yi Ping Ship which towed the damaged Yixing Ship back to Shanghai. It is expected to arrive on the 28th. The Tai Qi Ship arrived in Shanghai at 12:00 noon yesterday and docked at the Tamee Wharf in Lan Road.</p>
<h3>Towing to Shanghai for Repairs</h3>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reporter met with Jiejiang Company's Chinese compradore yesterday. According to him, the grain of the Yixing ship has been transported to Shanghai by the Thai Qi and Yi Ping ships. However, the water-soaked wheat and the damage to the Yixing ship have not been detailed. The company will decide on the repair plan based on the extent of the damage after the Yixing ship arrives in Shanghai.</p>

At 10:35 AM yesterday, it ran aground 35 nautical miles upstream of Wushan County. The bottom of the ship was damaged and water entered in several places. All members tried their best to drain water and implement various emergency measures. If the Yangtze River water does not decrease rapidly, it may not sink into the river. The Japanese Navy in Hankou received a telegram and immediately dispatched the warship Hot Sea to Wushan County for emergency rescue.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fishermen's Association Held Representative Assembly Yesterday</h3>
<p>Construction fees are difficult to recognize as heavy tax surcharges; collection of ocean protection fees can be discussed with fish merchants</p>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the Joint Association of Fish Industry Guilds of Jiangsu and Zhejiang held a representative assembly of various trade associations at 4:00 PM yesterday at the East Asia Bank Building, 5th Floor. Chairman Hu Diansun presided.</p>
<h3>Representatives Present</h3>
<p>Mao Anqing and Le Badong, representatives of the Ningbo Fresh and Salted Fish Industry; Shao Baoxing, representative of the Shanghai Seafood Industry Guild; Chen Zuyu, Ying Anmao, Weng Zhaofang, Liu Zhiyuan, Zhang Zhisheng, representatives of the Shanghai Salted Fish Industry Guild; Hu Diansun, Xu Wusun, Liu Tonghua, Chen Jiusong, Zhou Huixiang, Xu Shanxing, Sun Xinchang, Shen Xianlu, Wang Rongsheng, Dong Zuxiang, Wang Zuquan, Chen Linfu, Jiao Baizhang, Zhang Zhenfang, and over thirty other representatives of the Shanghai Fresh Fish Industry Guild.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>After the ceremonial procedures, the chairman reported, briefly stating that the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Improvement Association, in collecting construction fees, violated the fundamental principle of "taking from fisheries and using for fisheries." It ordered fish merchants to collect these construction fees on its behalf. As a result, various trade associations convened representatives, organized this office, and appealed to the Ministry of Industry, requesting that the previous principle of direct collection from fishermen be followed. Fish merchants act as agents for their customers, and the goods they handle are all of a transportation nature, without the authority to collect on behalf of others. A declaration was issued, seeking assistance. To avoid disputes, the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Improvement Association entrusted Yu Qiaqing, Du Yuesheng, and Yu Zuoting to mediate, but without success. Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo, after attending the Fisheries Improvement Association, again entrusted the original mediators to convene himself and Meng Lujiu and Mao Anqing on the 24th at the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association for further mediation. As a result of the mediation, the mediators presented the fishermen's suffering and the harshness of the collection personnel to the Ministry of Industry, and temporarily suspended the collection of fees until the case was resolved. On the one hand, outside of Shanghai, Ningbo Zhen organized an Ocean Protection Committee to collect ocean protection fees in order to improve the fisheries. Therefore, he and others convened representatives of various trade associations to discuss and proceed with relevant matters, and briefly reported on the mediation process, and so on.</p>
<h3>Meeting Results</h3>
<p>Following the chairman's report, the representatives discussed the matter and the following conclusions were reached: (1) The Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Improvement Association's order for fish merchants to collect construction fees on its behalf is inconsistent with principles and difficult to accept. (2) Seafood is an imported product and has already been declared to customs upon import. The re-imposition of construction fees is a heavy tax surcharge and should be clarified. (3) Salted products are also mostly imported, and their tax declaration is the same as seafood, so they should also be exempt from double taxation. (4) The mediator's mediation results based on the Ministry's claim for mediation are far from the principle and difficult to accept. (5) The mediator's proposal to collect ocean protection fees is still practically possible and can be discussed with fish merchants. (6) If the Ministry of Industry still upholds the principle of collection after the mediator's mediation results, fish merchants should insist on opposition. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<p>Talk by Official of the Railway Bureau</p>
<h3>Process of Revising Loading and Unloading Fees at Maigen Station</h3>
<p>Fees are entirely in accordance with transportation regulations</p>
<p>At the same time, the livelihood of workers is also taken into consideration</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, regarding the cancellation of the cooperative of loading and unloading workers at Maigen Road Station by the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration, the previous day's newspaper reported on talks by officials of the two railway unions, alleging that the new contractor took 20% of the loading and unloading fees and details of various price increases. A Central News Agency reporter specifically inquired about this with the official in charge of the bureau, who stated the following:</p>
<h3>Regulations on Contracting Fees</h3>
<p>The bureau's contract with Yang Hengzhen for contracting the loading and unloading of goods at Maigen Road is entirely in accordance with the "Regulations for Responsible Transportation of Railway Freight Cars of the Republic of China" Attachment 5 "Measures for Contracting Loading and Unloading of Railway Goods" stipulated by the Ministry of Railways. The regulation stipulates that the contractor should receive a remuneration of 10% of the total loading and unloading amount. At that time, to show consideration for the workers, it was stipulated that the original loading and unloading fee of 18 cents would be entirely given to the workers, and an additional 2 cents would be added as the contractor's remuneration. Therefore, the revised loading and unloading fee is 20 cents per ton. At the same time, it is stipulated that in addition to this 20 cents per ton loading and unloading fee, absolutely no further demands are allowed from customers. In this way, although customers superficially pay an additional 2 cents per ton for loading and unloading, the actual reduction in extra burdens is quite considerable. Workers can also effectively receive 18 cents per ton for loading and unloading, which is more favorable than before, when they had to deduct various expenses from it, receiving only about 12 cents per ton. To say that in addition to the 2 cents contractor's fee per ton, 20% must also be deducted from the 18 cents for the contractor is absurd. Furthermore, the number of contracting fees that the union talked about for each contractor per month, including the loading and unloading fees at Maigen Station, is approximately 5,000 yuan during this lean season. If 2 cents is added, this contractor can earn a generous profit of 1,000 yuan per month. In addition, by taking 20% from the workers, they can earn 2,000 yuan per month. According to our calculations, if the daily loading and unloading fee is 5,000 yuan, adding 2 cents would mean the contractor only receives 500 yuan per month (that is, 10% of the 20 cents per ton loading and unloading fee is 2 cents, including all equipment and management fees). We don't know what kind of calculation was used to arrive at 1,000 yuan or 2,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Demands of the Cooperative</h3>
<p>The method of price increase stipulated in May 1929 has another history, which is not convenient to disclose. The extra demands referred to by the bureau are like this: For a 30-ton car loaded with cotton, loading and unloading fees for 20 tons should be charged according to regulations, but the cooperative insisted on charging for 30 tons. The loading of firewood trucks was originally the same as ordinary goods, but the cooperative extorted double the fees. Taking the bundling fee as an example, the price increase method stipulates that adding a bundling fee for miscellaneous peanuts costs 12 cents per ton, but the cooperative charges 40 tons of bundling fee regardless of how much the goods being bundled together amount to. For example, for a 40-ton car, Merchant A loads 35 tons, and Merchant B loads 5 tons, but the cooperative uniformly charges 40 tons of bundling fee. In addition, there are various items such as surcharges and labor surcharges. Merchants who directly experience the pain can testify to these facts.</p>
<h3>Reasons for Cancelling the Cooperative</h3>
<p>The bureau canceled the cooperative this time in accordance with Article 26 of the cooperative's trial charter, which states that "if the cooperative fails to comply with the charter and violates the rules, the bureau may cancel the cooperative at any time and recruit other workers for loading and unloading. The various illegal acts of the cooperative are as described above, so the bureau's cancellation of the cooperative is a legitimate measure. As for the so-called deliberation meeting, according to the original text of Article 28 of the cooperative's trial charter, "in order to improve the lives of workers, resolve labor disputes, and seek agile and stable methods of loading and unloading, a deliberation meeting may be established when necessary, consisting of one representative each from the stationmaster, the police section chief, the foreman, and two forwarding companies that pay the most loading and unloading fees. The stationmaster shall convene the deliberation meeting."</p>
<p>It is clear that it cannot be discussed together with the provisions of Article 26.</p>
<h3>Estimate of Workers' Livelihood</h3>
<p>According to the ability of loading and unloading workers, loading and unloading 20 tons of goods per day is very easy. Now, assuming that 10 tons are loaded and unloaded per day, and each ton effectively earns 18 cents in loading and unloading fees, the daily income is 1.8 yuan. Currently, under the cooperative, loaders and unloaders effectively earn only 11 cents each. Taking 13 cents as a standard, they can only earn one yuan per day. Under the contracted loading and unloading goods system, they can earn half a yuan more per day. Finally, the official in charge of the bureau also said that the bureau's only goal is to alleviate the suffering of merchants, thereby increasing freight transport, and at the same time, to take care of the lives of workers. It is now hard to say that this method of contracting loading and unloading goods is a contract system. The right and wrong can only be left to the central government to resolve.</p>
<p>After the Sharp Decline in Business on the Two Railways</p>
<h3>Striving to Absorb Passenger and Freight Transport</h3>
<p>Changing methods to facilitate customers</p>
<p>Extensive recruitment to save the current situation</p>
<p>Huang Boqiao, Director of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration, in view of the sharp decline in passenger and freight business on the two railways, the main reason being the sluggishness of various industries and the decline of the rural economy, conducted detailed research and sought to save the situation. It was decided to change business methods, broadly recruit, and strive to absorb passenger and freight transport. Three measures were drafted and ordered to the employees of the two railways to jointly study and implement: (1) Thoroughly investigate transportation businesses that can compete with the railway business, and fully understand their routes, schedules, fares, and business conditions. Then, those who can handle intermodal transport should be contacted for intermodal transport, and those whose prices are not comparable to the railway's prices should be corrected accordingly. (2) Thoroughly investigate the bulk products produced and imported along the line, and fully understand their types, quantities, values, and sales sources, as well as the main sales seasons each year. Then, contact various customers at any time and place to undertake transportation. The conditions that customers hope for should be accepted to the extent possible. Furthermore, obstacles must be removed before customers express them. (3) Thoroughly investigate places of interest along the line that can be visited, cooperate with local areas to create an environment that can attract tourists, and provide tourists with various conveniences. In addition, there must be sufficient preparation for the dispatch of vehicles and arrangement of freight yards. Otherwise, if there is sufficient passenger and freight traffic, but the equipment or control of the itself is insufficient to meet the demand, it will inevitably lose credibility. It is especially important to train employees to thoroughly understand their responsibilities and proceed unanimously in the direction of automatic business.</p>
<p>New Aircraft of China Aviation Company Arrived in Shanghai</p>
<p>Currently Reporting to Customs for Inspection and Extraction</p>
<p>According to the New Voice Agency, China Aviation Company previously ordered two large Sikorsky aircraft from the American Curtiss Company in order to complete the Shanghai-Guangdong air route. They have now arrived in Shanghai aboard the German ship (SS Geitrude Maersk) and docked at the North Wharf of the China Merchants Bureau in Yangshupu at around 10:00 AM yesterday morning. Because the customs clearance procedures have not yet been negotiated, they have not been extracted. According to Li Diezhuang, secretary of the company, told a reporter from the New Voice Agency that personnel have been dispatched to contact customs regarding the procedures. After the procedures are completed, the aircraft parts will be transported to Longhua for assembly and test flights within three days. If the results are good, the route can be officially opened on July 8. This aircraft is the latest type of Sikorsky large aircraft, capable of accommodating eight passengers and a large amount of mail. It is equipped with dual-engine motors with 600 horsepower and can fly 200 miles per hour. It will travel from Shanghai to Guangzhou, passing through Wenzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, and Hong Kong before reaching Guangzhou. The entire route has a total of six stations. However, the airport radio stations and offices in Fuzhou, Shantou, and Hong Kong have not yet been set up. Therefore, at the beginning of the opening, it will only stop at Wenzhou and Xiamen along the way. The full fare is approximately 250 yuan. The detailed price list is still being formulated. Once formulated, it will be submitted to the ministry for approval and then announced.</p>
<p>Circular Telegram from the National Federation of Commerce</p>
<h3>Communicating the Formats for Company Applications</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Commerce telegraphed chambers of commerce and federations of commerce in various provinces and cities yesterday to inform them of the formats for company applications, which should be in accordance with the current Company Law. The original telegram is as follows: All provincial and nationwide federations of chambers of commerce and all provincial and municipal chambers of commerce, for your information. We have recently received Notification No. 18404 from the Ministry of Industry, which states, "Regarding the matter of notification, it has been found that merchants and citizens in various places who apply for company registration often lack clarity regarding the application procedures, resulting in omissions in the content of the registration items and the documents to be submitted. It is difficult for the competent authorities to review, and the back-and-forth of approvals takes time. In order to facilitate the prompt handling of affairs for merchants and citizens, and to be agile, based on the current Company Law, the Implementing Rules of the Company Law, and the Company Registration Rules, six types of company establishment application forms and one type of shareholder register form have been drafted for merchants and citizens to freely copy, fill out according to the forms, and expedite the process. In addition to distribution, seven types of forms, ninety copies each, are hereby attached and sent to the Federation, which is requested to inform all chambers of commerce to comply accordingly. This is hereby notified." In accordance with the above, seven types of application forms and shareholder register forms are enclosed and telegraphed to your association for your information and action. Attachment sent separately. Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, respectfully.</p>
<h3>Watch and Clock Industry Protests Customs' Inspection Powers</h3>
<p>The watch and clock industry informed all industries in the city of the impropriety of the government's amended import tax regulations adding a "customs may inspect stores at any time" clause, and requested that they unite to fight for protection. The draft letter is transcribed below: Respected Sirs, It has been found that customs exercises its inspection powers only when goods are imported. It has never been heard of to implement them on stores that sell goods. In September of last year, our colleague Shichangtai was unfortunately subjected to the trampling of the Jianghai Customs, illegal inspection, copying and impounding goods, and extorting tax documents. Shichangtai比 presented the invoice issued by the foreign firm, but the customs considered it invalid and insisted on verifying the tax document. At that time, Shichangtai said that the goods were purchased from a foreign firm in this port and only had an invoice, not a tax document. How could it be presented? He had no choice but to write to our association to request the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to negotiate with the Jianghai Customs, but to no avail. He was fined and the case was closed. Later, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and various import guilds believed that the Jianghai Customs not only failed to investigate its officials for dereliction of duty, but also failed to order foreign merchants to present tax documents. It arbitrarily inspected stores that sold goods, detained goods, and imposed fines, which were illegal and overstepped their authority, arousing public outrage. They pushed for representatives to go to Beijing to petition. The State Council and various ministries and departments, as well as the Customs Administration, also recognized that the customs' actions were illegal and agreed to stop them, and indicated that a Customs Law would be enacted to prevent such incidents in the future. However, ten months have passed, the Customs Law has not been promulgated by the government, and the clause "customs may inspect stores at any time" (see the Municipal Chamber of Commerce's notice on April 27) was added to the amended import tax regulations. How can this result not be contrary to the facts of the petition? Our association believes that the government sacrifices the law and intentionally maintains, and does not punish, customs officials who violate the law and disturb merchants. Since the government so disregards the commercial situation, our merchants and citizens must strive for protection. Therefore, on June 4 of this year, we wrote to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to request that the clause added to the amendment be corrected. On June 12, we received a letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce in reply, stating that the case had been telegraphed to the Finance Ministry's Customs Administration and the Legislative Yuan for amendment. A letter from the Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan stated that it had been approved and submitted to the Finance Committee for reference when the Customs Law is reviewed in the future. I am writing to inform you, etc. Our association's request for correction this time was based on the government's connivance at customs officials, who bullied merchants and citizens. Furthermore, the clause "customs may inspect stores at any time" added to the amended import tax regulations is particularly important to the import industry. Therefore, we will spare no sacrifice to thoroughly correct it. Now, upon reading the Legislative Yuan's response to the request for correction in this case, it was only approved for future reference and not prevented, suspended, or corrected. It is purely official perfunctory and cannot be considered an effective request to correct the import tax regulations. In addition to submitting it to the fourth members' congress of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce for decision in accordance with the law, because the matter concerns the import industry, we should strive together in order to achieve the purpose of correction. I respectfully inform you and ask for your kind attention.</p>
<p>Tram Workers in the Public Concession</p>
<h3>Scheduled to Petition the Party and Government Today</h3>
<p>Demanding the reinstatement of workers dismissed without cause</p>
<p>The Shanghai Electric Tramway Company in the Public Concession dismissed more than 20 workers by order of the Western manager, Thomson, causing opposition from all 1,000+ workers, creating a serious situation. According to the company's view, those dismissed were corrupt and refused to return to work. The workers, however, were only seeking improvement in their low wages (only about 20 yuan per month, with accommodation and meals at their own expense) and rose up in opposition. Although the party and government authorities sent personnel to mediate several times, the company's attitude was tough, resulting in no resolution. All the workers felt that the company had no sincerity in mediation and intended to take effective measures to deal with it. Fortunately, personnel from the Third District Water and Electricity Company exerted great effort to persuade them, avoiding extremism. Now, the labor union believes that the prolonged delay is causing concern for the workers' livelihood. A decision was made to send personnel to the party and government authorities today to petition, demanding that negotiations be conducted as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Swire Strike Report Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Swire Company's strike in Guangdong is showing increasing seriousness because there is no sign of rapprochement between the two sides. Yesterday's news is as follows:</p>
<h3>Serious Situation in Shantou</h3>
<p>The Guangdong Seamen's Branch has demanded the reinstatement of workers to Swire, but the company has not accepted. As a further indication, the company has automatically stopped carrying Guangdong cargo and passengers, and has stopped the Nan Hua liner from going to Guangzhou. Before the strike is resolved, it has decided to abandon the Guangzhou route. The Guangdong Seamen's Branch is therefore also active in Shantou, demanding that everyone join the strike. Because Swire operates more ships in Shantou than in Guangdong, in addition to the 11 ships on the Shanghai-Hong Kong line, there are also 6 ships such as the Singapore line and the Bangkok line. There is now talk of a strike in Shantou, although it has not yet been realized, but the situation is extremely serious.</p>
<h3>Telegraphic Notice to Stop Transportation of Passengers and Goods</h3>
<p>Shantou gangs have telegraphed Shanghai, asking the Shantou gangs in Shanghai to temporarily reduce the transport of goods and not to load Swire ships to prevent accidents. The Swire Company still sends ships to Shantou, but no passengers or goods are carried.</p>
<h3>Four Ships Returned to Shanghai</h3>
<p>After the Shandong, Jinan, Jinhua, and Xinjiang ships went on strike in Guangzhou, because the cargo inside the ships was Guangdong cargo and could not be loaded or unloaded, they agreed with the Seamen's Branch to allow the ships to return to Shanghai and transport the cargo inside to other companies' ships to Guangdong. Yesterday, Shandong and Xinjiang had already returned to Shanghai first and anchored at the Huatong Wharf. Jinan and others are expected to arrive in Shanghai today. The seamen and mid-cabin workers on each of these ships still served on the ships to Shanghai. The stevedores and lightermen are the most powerful in the current strike.</p>
<h3>Customers Have Been Affected</h3>
<p>The Swire Company has the greatest influence on the Nan Hua line. Those going from Shanghai to Guangdong have 12 ships including Shandong, Suzhou, Xin Ning, Xinjiang, Suiyang, Sichuan, Taiyuan, Jinan, Qingyuan, Qiongzhou, Guangdong, and Anhui. Five trips must be made every week. On weekdays, the most cargo loaded on their ships is from Guangdong. This time, the strike in Guangdong Province stopped loading and unloading goods, causing the goods that customers had booked contracts to transport to be stopped. It is reported that the fruit industry alone will lose more than 200,000 yuan due to being blocked. Other goods that have been blocked by the strike have also suffered significant losses this week. According to estimates by the Guangdong gangs, the direct and indirect losses suffered by the gangs after the Swire's loss have reached at least 700,000 to 800,000 yuan so far.</p>
<h3>Company Attitude - A Glimpse</h3>
<p>The Taikoo Company, regarding the current strike issue, outwardly expresses its unwillingness to discuss terms separately from the Cantonese seamen. If Shantou were to follow Guangzhou’s lead, they would rather not send ships, citing the reason that reforms should prevent strikes from occurring. However, with the near-total stoppage of cargo and passenger traffic to and from Guangdong and Shantou in recent days, and the rush to patronize China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and Jardine Matheson ships, the losses are quite significant. Therefore, they are secretly engaging with influential figures, hoping for a reversal. However, the inspector, Stirling, who was dispatched to Guangdong, is not going for the strike issue but for the warehouse issue, which is entirely unrelated to the strike.</p>
<p>French Mail Ship</p>
<h3>"Aramis" to be Repaired in Japan</h3>
<p>After the French mail ship "Aramis" struck a reef off Putuo Island, passengers and mail were first transported to Shanghai. Regarding the repair of the mail ship, the Shanghai manager of the company, Mr. Mihailes, and the shipowner, Shabani, agreed that the Japanese salvage company should send technicians and divers to Steep Island to assess the damage. They will first try to flatten the damaged part of the fourth cabin and then pump out the accumulated water and fill the holes. Yesterday afternoon, the company received a definite telegram stating that after the accumulated water was pumped out, the "Aramis" would be towed to Nagasaki, Japan, for major repairs in dry dock. The cargo inside the ship will not be unloaded temporarily. After the ship is repaired, it will come back to Shanghai for unloading. Therefore, the losses from water damage cannot be determined for the time being. The repair period is estimated to be about ten days, and the departure will be changed to around July 10th. For those customers who have already booked the ship for raw silk and other items, and who cannot wait due to time constraints, they will switch to the Blue Funnel Line passenger ship to France. Although the damage to the mail ship from running aground is minimal, the direct and indirect losses due to the delay in the schedule are huge. The cost of telegrams alone has already amounted to several thousand dollars.</p>
<h3>Letter from the Shanghai Municipal Council in Response to the Ratepayers' Meeting</h3>
<p>Restaurant Hygiene Regulations Cannot Be Accommodated</p>
<p>Some restaurants in the Hongkou area previously requested a postponement from the Ratepayers’ Chinese Association regarding the implementation of cleanliness regulations by the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department, such as the separate establishment of vegetable preparation rooms. The association, based on the circumstances, forwarded the request to the Municipal Council for consideration. Yesterday, the Municipal Council replied to the Ratepayers’ Chinese Association, explaining that the separate establishment of raw and cooked vegetable preparation rooms is the most essential measure to prevent food spoilage. For the sake of the health and safety of customers, even if the restaurants experience slight economic difficulties as a result, it is an unavoidable measure, and so on.</p>

Tracing back to our country's silk, although it has a long history, shines brightly globally, and clothes people from all directions, with the increasingly rampant dumping of foreign goods, national silk is gradually declining. The Shanghai Silk Industry Bank, because it has a relationship of mutual dependence with the silk weaving industry, based on its consistent aspiration to serve society, has contacted the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Commodity Exhibition Hall, the Electrical Silk Factory Association, and this association to jointly organize the Chinese National Silk Exhibition, to awaken the public's enthusiasm for using national goods, thereby initiating a genuine cooperation between the financial and industrial circles. The Silk Industry Bank, the Commodity Exhibition Hall, the Electrical Industry Association, and this association have each appointed representatives to start preparations and have set July 9th as the starting date. It has also been submitted to the Executive Committee of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce for approval. However, this matter is of great importance and depends on the collective wisdom and efforts of everyone to be successful.</p>

<h3>Excavation of Liu Family Ancient Tomb</h3>
<p>Well-Preserved Female Corpse from 500 Years Ago</p>
<p>Huge Stone Chamber, Ancient Costumes</p>
<p>The Liu family, descendants of an ancient tomb from the Ming Dynasty, located at No. 100 Wanzhu Street in Xiaobeimen, hired workers yesterday morning to excavate the tomb, intending to relocate the coffins to their hometown. During the excavation, a 500-year-old corpse was discovered, perfectly preserved, and jade, gold, and other items were unearthed. The details of the investigation are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Hiring Workers for Excavation</h3>
<p>Next to Gong Huiji Lumber Store on Wanzhu Street is an ancient Liu family tomb, facing south. There are also Weng Zhong (stone figures), and bamboo fences around the tomb. The house number is 100. The owner of the tomb is named Liu. Yesterday morning, he hired dozens of workers to excavate the tomb. In the center of the main burial chamber, a huge stone chamber was discovered. After opening it, there was another giant wooden outer coffin. In the middle was an ochre-colored camphor wood coffin, slightly damaged.</p>
<h3>Corpse Does Not Discolor</h3>
<p>Upon opening the coffin, a female corpse was seen, her face not discolored despite her advanced age. The corpse was dressed in a first-rank court robe, a pearl crown, a python robe, a red skirt, and silk boots. A yellow satin was tied on the corpse's forehead, with a piece of white jade in the middle. Several pieces of emerald and pure gold jewelry were also found. Next to the corpse's head were a pair of porcelain bowls, filled with two bowls of white rice. However, after a gust of wind and sunlight shone in, the corpse turned black.</p>
<h3>Ming Dynasty Chenghua</h3>
<p>Above the stone chamber were carvings with characters such as "Ming Dynasty Chenghua Seventeenth Year." It is found that nearly 500 years have passed since the Ming Dynasty Chenghua era, yet the corpse remains perfectly preserved. The owner originally intended to collect the bones for burial, but now that the corpse has been found intact, he has purchased a black lacquered coffin to re-enshrine the female corpse.</p>
<h3>Camphor Wood Fragrance</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the reporter personally went to the site to investigate. Dozens of workers were still excavating at the site. More than ten bone boxes and a black lacquered plank (for enshrining the female corpse) were prepared. The damaged camphor wood material had already been picked up by others. When burned, it had an unusually fragrant aroma. The workers separately collected the bones from the buried coffins, placed them in bone boxes, and then transported them to their hometown for burial.</p>
<h3>Various Rumors</h3>
<p>There are two versions of the excavation story. One is that the Liu family is now selling the tomb site and will receive 60,000 yuan for the land. They must relocate the coffins before they can hand over the land and receive the property rights. Another version is that the descendants of the Liu family, because the market in that area is about to develop, plan to build city houses themselves, so they hired workers to excavate and completely relocate the buried coffins.</p>
<h3>Black Water Goldfish</h3>
<p>Also, news has been received that a tomb of the Liu family, a prominent official in the Ming Dynasty, in the Nine Mu Land area, has a total of more than 18 mu of tomb land. In addition to the Weng Zhong in front of the tomb, there are also stone horses and other items. The tomb is managed by Liu Shixi, a villager from Huajin Pailou, who is responsible for collecting grain. During the late Qing Dynasty, the tomb land was sold off one after another, and now only more than 1 mu and 8 fen of the tomb base remain. However, the two Weng Zhong in front of the tomb are still there, but they have been moved in and are half-buried in the soil compared to before. According to those who know the history of the tomb, when the tomb land was sold off during the late Qing Dynasty, a Liu family member living in Nanxiang came out to stop it and negotiated with Liu Shixi, saying that this tomb was his ancestral tomb and that there was another tomb in Longhua, entrusted to A Mao, who was responsible for paying the grain, and presented the family tree as proof. However, the property deed was in Liu Shixi's possession. After mediation, both Liu families were deemed to have the same ancestors and were jointly owned. Recently, because the Liu family living in Nanxiang failed in business, they agreed with the Liu Shixi family to sell the tomb to a certain company. The Liu family supervised the workers in excavating and collecting bones yesterday and the day before yesterday. Unexpectedly, the tomb was built firmly and was not easy to destroy. There were more than twenty tombs, one coffin per chamber. The double chamber of the main Zhao Mu has not yet been excavated, and most of the others have been excavated. Outside the stone sarcophagus, it was covered with a single stone slab. Inside the pit, the coffins were mostly not decayed, resembling catalpa coffins. Yesterday morning, a female coffin was excavated. Unexpectedly, there was black water in the pit, and there were even goldfish swimming in it. The Liu family supervisor scooped them up in a basin and moved them away. Then the female coffin was opened, and the female corpse inside was not decayed at all, with a lifelike face. There were three rings on the left hand, and the right hand held the twelve zodiac signs. She was also wearing a phoenix crown and ceremonial robes. The wind also did not turn her into ash. Because the Liu family supervisor saw that she was not decayed at all, the small bone box could not hold her, so he went nearby to buy a black coffin to re-enshrine her (the coffin is still at the tomb site). In addition, the bones were collected in white wood bone boxes. There was only one tombstone in front of the main chamber. The writing on the tombstone had been eroded and was blurred. What was still visible was "Imperial Construction," "Rong Ying," Ming Chenghua 23rd year, and Daoguang 2nd year, etc. Half of it was still in the mud, making it difficult to see the full picture. According to nearby elders, it belongs to the family of Liu Bowen of the Ming Dynasty. This is recorded for now.</p>
<p>Red Pill Trafficking Ring Busted</p>
<h3>Red Pills Worth 40,000 Yuan Seized</h3>
<p>Both Rings Located in Wuding Lane, Wuding Road</p>
<p>Six People Arrested, Batch of Red Pill Making Machines Seized</p>
<p>The Public Concession police have been strictly cracking down on red pills and opium recently. In the past week, they have busted several large red pill manufacturing rings and sent them to the Special Court for severe punishment. The Putuo Road police recently seized a red pill manufacturing and trafficking ring on Wuding Road, confiscating a large batch of red pills, estimated to be worth 40,000 yuan. The information obtained from the investigation is recorded below.</p>
<p>West Detective Huamen of the Putuo Road police recently received a tip from an informant that someone had privately established a red pill manufacturing ring at No. 8 Dashitang Lane, Wuding Road. The scale was quite large, and the output was also high. A trafficking and storage ring was also set up at No. 32 Wuding Lane to secretly sell the pills. He began to investigate and confirmed the information. He then requested two search warrants from the First Special District Court. At around 11:00 AM on the 24th of this month, he and Chinese detectives Yao Yuanlong, Feng Baishun, detective chief Chen Hongbin, and Wu Changkai secretly went to the address in two groups. They arrested three people from Zhejiang, Liu Lianchang, Fu Shimei from Hangzhou, and Yang Weibo from this city, on the ground floor of No. 32. They arrested Guangdong native Yang Baosheng and Suzhou woman Pan Shenshi inside the kitchen of No. 8. At the time, three people escaped from the attic to the roof. One of them, named Zhou Laisheng from Changzhou, crawled on the roof to the next house, hoping to sneak out with two women. Zhou was arrested by the detectives, and the two women were released because they were not involved. They also seized a large number of red pills, about three suitcases and more than ten large packages, estimated to be hundreds of thousands of pills, worth about 40,000 yuan, and manufacturing machines, coffee essence, coca, and other poisons, as well as other various items, at the above two locations. The detectives then telegraphed the police station to dispatch several cars to the two locations to transport the above-mentioned six men and women, including Liu Lianchang, and the red pill machines back to the police station for separate detention. However, Fu Shimei and Yang Weibo were sent to the hospital for treatment due to illness. Yesterday morning, the police first sent the four defendants, including Liu, and one box of red pills to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The defendant hired lawyer Wu Linkun to defend them. First, the police lawyer Li Zhishan rose and detailed the above-mentioned bust, saying that the police investigation procedures for each defendant had not been completed and that Fu and Yang were staying in the hospital due to illness and could not be brought to court today. Therefore, he requested permission to detain them and reschedule a special hearing. All the seized red pills and machines were too numerous, so they were temporarily kept at the police station. Today, only one box of red pills was brought to the case for inspection. When questioned, Liu Lianchang confessed that the house at No. 32 Wuding Road was a two-story building, rented by him. He lived in the side room on the ground floor and rented the pavilion room upstairs to Chen Zifang. The red pills were all seized in Chen's room. Chen had moved elsewhere. Yesterday, the police detectives used an axe to split the door open, and so on. Detective Huamen said that the pavilion room door was tightly locked. The police first planned to split it with an axe, but Liu took out the key from his side, so it was opened. The key could also open the door of No. 8. Yang Baosheng confessed that he was arrested yesterday while looking for a friend. Zhou Laisheng confessed that he worked as a tea servant at Chen Zixiang's place and that the red pills were made by Chen. Pan Shenshi confessed that she was employed by Chen for 17 yuan, saying that she would be paid 3 yuan per month, but she had not received a penny. The secret manufacturing of red pills was in a secret room on the third floor, and she was not allowed to go upstairs, so she did not know. Judge Wu Tingqi verified the confession and ordered the defendants to be detained for another hearing on the morning of July 4th.</p>
<h3>Zhongshan Village Assassination</h3>
<p>Huang Changqi Killed by Knife Wounds</p>
<p>Zheng Guiyou Said to be the Assailant</p>
<p>At about 3:10 AM yesterday, a brutal assassination occurred in a bungalow at No. 9 Zhongshan Village, near Daxia University on Zhongshan Road, West Shanghai. The deceased's head was split open, both hands were chopped off, and he had more than ten cuts all over his body. Blood flowed everywhere, a truly horrific sight. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Boarding Dining Society</h3>
<p>Huang Changqi, a native of Heng County, Guangxi, aged twenty-six, came to Shanghai last year and enrolled in Jianguo Middle School in Zhabei. After only one semester, he dropped out due to illness. Around mid-May of this year, he boarded at No. 9 Zhongshan Village, Zhongshan Road, which was rented by his friend Huang Jieqing. Soon after, Huang opened the Sanhai Dining Society, and Changqi took care of everything for him. However, the opening lasted less than ten days before it closed due to poor business. At the beginning of this month, Huang Jieqing returned to Guangxi to raise funds, leaving only Huang Changqi to look after the society. The old steward, Zheng Guiyou, who was employed by the society, was also dismissed. However, Zheng, who was of a very fierce disposition, harbored resentment towards Changqi. Several days after the owner left Shanghai, he returned to the society and tricked Huang into giving him four square tables, which he then sold for his own use. Later, he sneaked in to steal, but was beaten up by Huang.</p>
<h3>Circumstances of the Assassination</h3>
<p>Because the place was remote and the house was a bungalow, Huang locked the front door at night. However, there was a small creek behind the house, and a window facing the creek. The assailant swam across the creek, pried open the window, and climbed in. At that time, the electric light wire in the house had already been cut, and it was dark. As Huang was fast asleep, the assailant wielded a knife and slashed at Huang wildly. Huang woke up in pain and cried out, falling from the bed to the ground. Seeing that his purpose had been achieved, the assailant abandoned a sharp cleaver, a pair of black rubber shoes, and a pair of black gauze socks, and fled through the original window and across the creek.</p>
<h3>Identification of the Assailant</h3>
<p>Pan Xiangtao, who lived in a neighboring village and was in charge of managing the houses, heard the cries and hurriedly put on his clothes and went out. Knowing that the sound came from No. 9, he knocked on the front door. At that time, Huang was still able to speak, and he cried out miserably, "I can't move, come quickly through the window." Pan went to the back and climbed in through the window. Huang then said to Pan, "It was the dismissed old steward Zheng Guiyou who came to kill me." His words were already slurred. Pan saw that Huang's head and hands had been slashed, and blood was flowing all over the ground. He was on his last breath. He then went to Daxia University to report to his fellow villager Yao Chuanqi. Upon hearing the news, Yao immediately telephoned the Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road. The hospital immediately dispatched an ambulance, which rushed to the scene and transported Huang to the hospital. However, due to the severity of his injuries, he died before he could be treated.</p>
<h3>The Horrific State of Being Hacked</h3>
<p>At that time, Yao immediately reported to Yang Jinxiang, the police chief of the 6th District Police Station on Zhongshan Road, who immediately went to inspect the scene. He examined the deceased's head and found three or four knife marks on the back of the head. Both hands were severed, with only some skin and flesh still connecting them. There were also three or four knife marks on the back and waist, with very large wounds. There were two knife wounds on the legs. Blood was everywhere. He took the remaining cleaver, shoes, and socks back with him and reported to the 6th District Police Station. After receiving the report, District Chief Tan immediately ordered Zhu Maoqing, the local Baojia chief, to report to the court. He also issued an order to his subordinates and the detective team to intensify the search for the murderer.</p>
<h3>Escaping the Summer Heat in Mogan Mountain</h3>
<p>Mogan Mountain is located twenty-five miles northwest of Wukang County, Zhejiang. The peaks stand majestically, and the scenery is ever-changing. Although the heat at the foot of the mountain is intense every year, the temperature on the mountain has never exceeded 86 degrees Fahrenheit. In addition, the springs and forests are elegant and the scenery is secluded and beautiful, making it ideal not only for escaping the summer heat but also for sightseeing. Therefore, Chinese and foreigners alike yearn for it and call it a "cool realm for the people." Time flies, and the hot summer is upon us again. If you wish to escape the heat, seek out secluded spots, and enjoy the scenery but have no guide, the joint summer office of the China Travel Service and the Shanghai Bank in this city is at your service.

It is sold for only twenty cents, and every visitor to the mountain should have one.</p>
<p>Killing Bedbugs with Gasoline:</p>
<h3>A Woman Dies Tragically from Burns</h3>
<p>Rickshaw Puller Can't Sleep at Night</p>
<p>Eradicating Bedbugs Causes a Major Disaster</p>
<p>The residents of the car inn opened by Xia Zhigao, a Yangzhou native, at No. 68 Ximen Lane, Ximen Road, French Concession, are all rickshaw pullers from Jiangbei. Some live alone, while others bring their families to stay. On the evening of the 18th of this month, at twelve o'clock, Xu Chengtang (age 20), a rickshaw puller from Jiangbei, could not sleep because the bed board he was lying on was infested with bedbugs. He poured gasoline into the cracks of the wooden board to kill the bedbugs. He also threw the board violently on the ground to drive away the bedbugs. Unexpectedly, the weather was hot, and the gasoline, agitated by the violent throwing, exploded, scattering sparks. The sparks touched the gasoline in a tin can, and in an instant, the fire spread, burning the bodies of Li Yukun (age 23), a rickshaw puller from Yancheng, and his wife, Sun (age 21), who lived in the same inn. At that time, the other residents of the inn tried to put out the fire, and fortunately, a major disaster was averted. The second landlord, Xia Zhigao, the owner of the car inn, sent Li and his wife to Renji Hospital. Li's burns were light, and after the doctor applied medicine and bandaged him, he was discharged from the hospital and returned to the inn to recuperate. However, Sun's injuries were severe, and she was hospitalized for treatment. Unfortunately, the fire toxins attacked her heart, and the treatment was ineffective. She died at 3:00 PM on the 25th (the day before yesterday). Because both Xu and Li were poor men, the owner of the car inn, Xia Zhigao, mediated and paid 100 yuan to purchase clothing and a coffin for burial. However, the corpse handlers refused, demanding a large amount of compensation, and the mediation was unsuccessful. It was not until 2:00 AM the night before last that the matter was reported to the French police, who dispatched detectives to arrest and detain Xu Chengtang, the person responsible for the accident. Sun's body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan branch for an autopsy. Yesterday morning, the Second Special District Court was notified, and Prosecutor Wang Ren was appointed to examine the body. After confirming the body, he took his seat in court. First, the Bao Detective reported the previous events and brought the defendant to the case for questioning. The official questioned the victim's family, the defendant, and witnesses such as Xia Zhigao about the circumstances of the accident. He then ordered that Li Sunshi had indeed died from burns sustained during her lifetime. The body was collected by the corpse handler, Li Yukun, who signed a pledge. Whether the defendant was at fault would be investigated and dealt with by the police.</p>

<h3>Thieves Practice Kung Fu</h3>
<p>| Tying Lead to Their Legs to Practice Light and Agile Steps |</p>
<p>Wang Abao, a native of Jiangyin, aged twenty-one, has recently become unemployed and has joined a gang of thieves to make a living by stealing. On the morning of the 18th of this month, at 2:00 AM, he sneaked into the home of a Westerner named Fugalini (transliteration) at No. 128 Avenue Joffre, French Concession, and climbed over the low wall at the back to steal. He was spotted by the cook of the house, who grabbed him and called the police. After the police chief examined Wang, he found that his legs moved strangely. Upon checking his legs, he discovered that Wang had secretly tied lead strips to each leg. Each lead strip was about an inch long and weighed two liang, totaling about half a catty. They were sewn into white cloth straps, and the straps were embroidered with the twelve characters "Fu Ru Dong Hai, Shou Bi Nan Shan, Tian Xia Wei Gong, Cheng Ran Jian," with the characters arranged in intervals. At this point, the police chief realized that Wang was a seasoned thief who tied lead to his legs to practice his stealing skills, making his steps light and quick and his jumps agile. This would allow him to run away quickly if encountered, making it difficult to catch him. He ordered Wang to be detained and sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation and investigation to determine whether he had committed any other crimes. The police investigation has been completed. Wang has not committed any crimes in the concession and this is his first offense. Yesterday, Judge Wang Wangxuting continued the trial in the Criminal Division. Gu Shouxi, the lawyer for the police, stated the facts of the case and requested that Wang be punished for attempted theft under Article 338 of the Criminal Law. When questioned, Wang's testimony was evasive. The court ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and scheduled the sentencing for July 5th.</p>

<p>Reader's Advisor</p>
<h3>My Reading Problems</h3>
<p>| Letter from Ms. Yao Chun of Tongcheng |</p>
<p>When the newspaper arrives every day, I always read the Reader's Advisor column first, before any other news. From this, you can imagine my admiration for your column!</p>
<p>Now I have a difficult matter that is causing me great confusion and hesitation! Before getting to the main topic, please allow me to briefly describe my experiences:</p>
<p>In the fourth year after my birth, my loving mother left me! My father married a concubine and lived a wandering life outside, so I was not often supervised. I dropped out of a certain girls' school before graduating from the higher primary level.</p>
<p>Later, I studied traditional Chinese painting with a certain painter for three years, but alas, I was too dull! Three years passed in vain, and I achieved nothing!</p>
<p>I married at the age of eighteen. My husband's family was large, a large family system. Relying on the legacy of our ancestors, we could at least have a bowl of rice to eat. My husband was a person with little knowledge, born with the temperament of a young master, idle all day long, only capable of gambling. I repeatedly advised him, but all in vain, and this hurt our feelings!</p>
<p>My family was affected by the rural economic bankruptcy. In addition to the family not being productive, the failure of business year after year gradually plunged us into an unsustainable state, even to the point of being afraid of daily life!</p>
<p>In the seven years of our marriage, I gave birth to one son and two daughters, and all the burdens became even more unbearable! In the spring of the year before last, I found a job as a subject teacher in a certain elementary school. My salary was more than ten yuan per month, which was enough to make ends meet in the less expensive interior, and after allocating various expenses, there were no savings! But where will the educational fund for my children in the future and my expenses after retirement come from? Because I dropped out of school in my childhood, my intelligence and knowledge are very childish. At a time when the cry for unemployment is spreading throughout the country, it will be difficult for me to find another job!</p>
<p>Because I still lack the knowledge applicable to society, I still want to continue to study, but several difficult questions are blocking my mind. Wise sirs! Can you give me clear guidance?</p>
<p>Now, because of financial difficulties, I will of course have to find a way to raise tuition fees. Fortunately, I have a monthly friend in Xunjiang whose family is still wealthy. She pities my situation and is willing to bear all my expenses, but she also wants me to study with her in a certain girls' school. It is said that the school is entirely a women's school, established for women who have dropped out of school. The level is not very high. It is founded by a church, and only after graduating from high school can one go out to work. But the time limit is too long, and it is also far away from home, which makes me hesitate.</p>
<p>If I enroll, how will the children be arranged, and how will all the expenses for the children and other things be managed? Although the children can be entrusted to family members to take care of, who will bear all the expenses? This is the second thing that makes me hesitate.</p>
<p>The times are like floating clouds, unpredictable. The Red Army in western Jiangxi is so rampant that if it spreads to Xun, the public schools will be affected! Wouldn't it be a failure halfway, and then both places would be suspended, and it would be difficult to advance or retreat? This is the third thing that makes me worry.</p>
<p>My reading problems are as described above. I would like to ask the gentlemen to discuss and give me instructions. This is what I most look forward to!</p>
<p>Answer: When a person is in a dilemma, the only thing to do is to "ignore everything" and "abandon everything" to save oneself from the old society and the old family. Otherwise, if you look here and can't bear to part with your children, and look there and can't bear to part with your husband, then you will only end up trapped in that miserable life of mire, never able to extricate yourself. In our opinion, since you do not get along well with your husband, and the children can be taken care of by your husband's family, you should free yourself and study. The unfortunate problems of childbirth and family do not know how many Chinese young men and women have been harmed! Only by resolutely abandoning everything can there be a solution.</p>
<p>Since a certain lady is willing to help you study and also wants to study with you, it is naturally a rare opportunity. If you can gain considerable knowledge as a result, what does it matter if it takes a little longer? However, experience tells us that you may not learn any truly useful science in church schools. If you want to study, you can borrow a few dozen dollars from a certain lady and buy a batch of useful books to study on your own, which is more practical. I see that your writing is very fluent, so you are not without means.</p>
<p>As for the second question that the lady hesitates about, in addition to the "ignore everything" method that we mentioned earlier, there is no other foolproof solution. The third worry is also correct, but if what the lady expects comes true, and the Guomindang army "spreads to Xun," I don't think the school will be affected much. At least, you are the one who seeks knowledge, so you don't have to worry too much.</p>
<p>Correction: The title for the past two days should have been "Submit? Or Continue to Fight? How to Fight?" This is to correct this.</p>

<h3>An Anecdote About Lychees</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Crimson silk-clad fairy maidens, with skin as white and translucent as jade. I want to beg the Green Emperor with a green petition, to transplant these beauties to Dongwu. The Yangmei of Dongting is worthy of being their sister, piled on a plate like coral and jade intertwined.</p>
<p>These are famous lines from Mr. Yu Qingmen's "Nan Shi Xing." "Nan Shi Xing" lists all kinds of foods from Lingnan. These few lines are specifically about lychees. Although not explicitly stated, the spirit is already there, just like the line in Su Dongpo's poem, "Lu Shan immortal in crimson silk robe," which can also be used as a riddle for lychees.</p>
<p>Shao Qingmen and Wang Ruan Ting were very close friends. Shao was a recluse, while Wang was a famous minister. When Wang Ruan Ting was ordered to offer sacrifices to the South Sea, the prefect welcomed him in the suburbs, and the county magistrate led the way with anger. However, the only regret was that when he arrived in Lingnan, the lychees were not yet ripe. When Shao Qingmen arrived in Lingnan, his zither and sword were scattered, and he suffered the cold eyes of the world. However, there was one thing that made him feel better: it was precisely when the lychees were ripe, so he could feast on them to his heart's content. Therefore, in a poem that Qingmen sent to Ruan Ting, he wrote: "I came just in time for lychee season, with ruby-like berries piled up like agate. The crimson robe, freshly bathed in the clear spring, is wrinkled; the orchid fragrance is faintly broken, the icy muscles are cold; the sweet snow melts without residue, and the jade nectar and rosy liquid compete for fragrance. Who can compare to the redness and greenness, even the hairpin-like cloves are pitiful. Eat half a month and change your hair color, look in the mirror at your rejuvenated face! I send this poem far away to Mount Hua Bu Zhu, imagining the gentleman stroking his beard, holding his belly and kissing with drool." Qingmen's poem clearly intended to attract Ruan Ting's drool. Mao Zhihuang jokingly commented: "The four lines about the clear spring are a portrait of the lychee, with color, sound, fragrance, and taste all present, making my jaws drop." Xu Yu also commented interestingly.</p>
<p>There is a type of lychee called "hanging silk," produced in Zengcheng. In the former Qing dynasty, the government sealed it as a private item, and it was truly a supreme delicacy. It is a pity that it is now extinct. The "gongsun" of Dongguan, the "guimei" of Heshan, and the "concubine smile" of Nanhai are all treasures among lychees, but unfortunately, the production is not high. "A courier rides, bringing the 'concubine smile'," everyone must envy the good fortune of Concubine Yang. In fact, the lychees of Lingnan, presented to Shaanxi, no matter how quickly delivered, have ultimately lost their true flavor. The most delicious lychees are the fresh fruits picked in the morning. Lychees in the dewdrops of the morning, picked and eaten at will, their sweetness and fragrance directly penetrating the lungs. Unless one grows up in Guangdong, it is difficult to appreciate this delicacy. If Concubine Yang knew, she would surely be drooling incessantly at Mawei Station.</p>
<h3>Rather Beg for Three Years Than Be an Official</h3>
<p>— Si Su</p>
<p>The most precious thing is officialdom, and the cheapest thing is beggary. The so-called scholars of the past and the so-called students of today all aim to become officials. Once they become officials, the poor will naturally become rich, and beautiful wives and concubines, servants, and maids, as well as Western-style houses and automobiles, will all be at their disposal, and their past fantasies will become reality. Beggary is the cheapest thing, and who would be willing to do it? However, there is a saying that "rather beg for three years than be an official." Is this not strange? Beggars are not fools, so why would they rather beg for three years than become officials?</p>
<p>Things in the world are truly difficult to say. Don't look down on beggars. Beggary does have its enjoyable aspects. Beggars squatting by the roadside, with tears streaming down their faces, constantly saying "young mistress" and "miss," and not being able to beg a copper coin from a certain young mistress or miss, naturally have no future. You must know that there are also beggars who sit high on their thrones, issuing orders. There are even those who have official positions and departments under their command, as well as subordinates who are like ministers in charge of vast territories. To ask them to become officials, I am afraid they would not be willing. Shanghai is like this. Newspapers have also reported on it, so there is no need to say more. I have now discovered a special kind of beggar, and those who do not know about the kind of beggar mentioned above in Shanghai will be even more surprised. This kind of beggar is found in Pudong. They have wives and children, and their families are completely the same as ordinary families. They live in houses that are no different from those of ordinary people, rented with money. Pudong is a slum, with many irregular thatched houses. They live among people who are engaged in legitimate labor, and it is not easy to see that they are beggars. Even the neighbors on the left and right cannot easily detect it. They get up early in the morning, the whole family mobilizes, cross the river to Puxi, and return home in the afternoon to cook and eat. This is almost the same as those engaged in legitimate labor. The only difference is that once they arrive in Puxi, they go their separate ways to beg, instead of engaging in legitimate labor. It is only when someone in Pudong recognizes them and happens to meet them begging in Puxi that they realize that they are engaged in beggary as a profession. It is said that they also try to avoid meeting acquaintances, so they always go to places a little further away to beg. For beggars like this, who can say that they are not "happy to do it"!</p>
<h3>The Supernatural Powers of Flies</h3>
<p>— Zha Zhen</p>
<p>The fly, long known as a great demon disturbing mankind, is now rampant and rampantly harassing us again! What role do they play as managers of disease transportation companies? And what methods should we use to deal with them? These are not what I intend to describe in this article; I will now introduce and praise some of their unique supernatural powers that are not widely known to the public.</p>
<p>Proboscis丨Its proboscis is a tube, with countless fine tubes inside like a sieve. The proboscis is very long and hidden under the lower part of the head when resting. The end of the proboscis is covered with two oval protrusions, which are very easy to stick to objects. Whenever the proboscis touches liquid, the pharynx produces a suction action, sucking the substance into the oral cavity, passing through the neck to the chest and abdomen. If the food is solid, it secretes saliva to dissolve it, coating the proboscis. Moreover, it is attracted to fatty and smelly substances, making it an uninvited guest everywhere, and it can eat from the table to under the table. It can truly be called a mouth that is born to freeload.</p>
<p>Strange Eyes丨Its head is spherical, with a pair of antennae on top, and two compound eyes on the sides of the antennae, composed of thousands of simple eyes, occupying most of the head. There are also three simple eyes on the top of the head, arranged in a pyramid shape, with a dividing line between the two compound eyes. The male's is black and very narrow, while the female's is brown and slightly wider. Due to the special structure of its eyes and the flexible rotation of its head, its field of vision is quite wide. Even if a strong enemy suddenly approaches from behind, it can often escape at the first sign, which is largely due to its strange eyes.</p>
<p>Followers丨Everyone knows that it carries many bacteria on its head, body, and feet. But how many does it actually carry? According to a survey by a scientist, the number of bacteria attached to its limbs is approximately 5.5 million to 6.6 million. It leads so many follower soldiers to harass people at any time, so it's no wonder it often causes chaos!</p>
<p>Reproduction丨In a suitable environment, it can reproduce nine generations in one warm season. The total number of its offspring is estimated to be about 5 followed by 29 zeros. Its reproductive power is truly astonishing. If people seeking children want to pray to gods and worship Buddha, they might as well quickly build a temple for the "Fly Goddess." If the Goddess is efficacious, I guarantee that she can immediately bless you with many fair-skinned and chubby sons, making you very happy. Haha! Flies have such supernatural powers, what should we think after seeing this?</p>
<h3>Northeast Fourth Company Commander</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 10 Hearing the Words, a Beautiful Heart is Alerted, the Hope of Being Ennobled is Vague</p>
<p>Admiring Colors are Revealed by the Song, a Body at Leisure Serves the Country</p>
<p>He thought to himself that as soon as he entered the gate, he would definitely meet Guizhi. But things didn't go as planned, the Yang family quietly closed the outer wind door, and there was no sound at all. He returned home. The only reason was to visit his father. Of course, he continued to walk towards the inner courtyard. Old Man Zhao saw him in the inner room and asked: "What are you doing back at this time? Why don't you hurry back to the camp?" Zhao Ziqiang said: "Is there anything you need to tell me?" Old Man Zhao said: "I have nothing, go ahead." Zhao Ziqiang saw his father urging him so urgently, so he had no choice but to not enter the room and turn around to walk outside. But as he walked, the leather shoes on his feet made a loud "squeak, squeak" sound, which could almost be heard in both the front and back courtyards. Sure enough, his way of walking was quite effective. When he reached the front courtyard, Guizhi lifted up the piece of paper pasted on a small glass pane in the middle of the window, revealing a pale face inside the glass. Zhao Ziqiang naturally turned his head to look over there, and the two of them met face to face. In that instant, Company Commander Zhao could not suddenly stop and stare, but two red clouds rose on the old maiden's face, and she had already withdrawn her pale face into the glass window. Guizhi's withdrawal greatly startled Jiang, who was sitting on the kang. She sat up and asked: "What's the matter?" Guizhi said: "Nothing." Jiang said: "Who came to the courtyard?" Guizhi didn't answer and went to the small table to pour tea. Jiang said: "Didn't you hear me? I'm asking who's outside." Guizhi said: "It's nothing, it's just someone walking by." Hearing this, Jiang couldn't help but chuckle. It turned out that her own daughter called Zhao Ziqiang "Company Commander Zhao." Since the marriage issue officially arose, she had never mentioned the three words "Company Commander Zhao." This time, forced to speak, she was too embarrassed to call "him" or "Company Commander Zhao," so she compromised and called "someone." It was difficult for her daughter to come up with this at the time. Jiang heard the sound of leather shoes in the courtyard and half thought it was none other than the Fourth Company Commander. Now that her daughter said it was "someone," it hit the nail on the head, knowing that it was definitely Company Commander Zhao. While admiring her daughter's eloquence, she couldn't help but chuckle. (112)</p>
<h3>Bean Trellis and Melon Racks</h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>The barley has been harvested! The vegetables are also out of season 丨 What are they planting in the countryside now? In the neat rows of fields, there are soybeans planted very neatly. There are also neat bamboo racks built, with melon vines climbing on them, wax gourds, silk gourds, green gourds, and night-blooming gourds all growing. Bean trellises and melon racks are now the only good scenery in the countryside. Standing at the edge of the field and looking around in the slanting sunlight is really interesting.</p>
<p>Although I am a friend who plays with the pen, I also work as an old gardener who wields the hoe. Through a year of experience, I really have some small tricks. Now I will write some out to contribute to the readers (1) Beans Planting beans is the most relaxing thing in farming. You don't need to water and fertilize every day, just remove some weeds every few days. Before sowing, first remove all the weeds on the ground, then hoe the soil finely, and divide it into rows and ridges. Mix the bean seeds with rice ash and sow them, don't squeeze them too tightly, make three plants into a cluster, and space the clusters about a foot apart. Then the stems and plants will not grow too long, and the beans will naturally be abundant. All kinds of broad beans, red beans, and green beans are planted in this way. When flowering, there is a kind of hard-shelled beetle that needs to be caught, otherwise it will bite off the flowers and won't bear fruit. As for small green worms, they are the old patrons of vegetables, but they won't go to the beans. There are also cowpeas, flat beans, and sword beans, the planting method is similar to the above.</p>
<p>(2) Melons The melons planted here are wax gourds, silk gourds, green gourds, night-blooming gourds, and winter melons, pumpkins, etc. for vegetable use. Watermelons and golden melons are not planted, so I won't talk about them. Around the Beginning of Summer, choose plump and non-worm-eaten melon seeds, sprout seedlings in fine and fertile soil. When the seedlings are two or three inches long, then plant them one by one. Hoe the field into wide ridges of about two feet, and build melon racks on both sides with thin bamboo, the height should be four or five feet, and plant one plant every foot or so. Fertilize before flowering and water frequently. Most melons have fine hairs on their stems, so they are not afraid of small green worms, but hard-shelled beetles need to be caught. Among them, pumpkins and winter melons can grow directly on the ground, because the racks cannot bear their weight.</p>
<p>Voice of National Salvation</p>
<h3>Explanation of the Standards for National Salvation</h3>
<p>— Miao Zhuan</p>
<p>Recently, the phrase "Join Hands in National Crisis" is commonly used. According to my humble understanding, for the academic community to face the national crisis, it roughly means enduring dangers and obstacles, as a gentleman constantly cultivates his virtue and practices teaching. Hegel took the lecture hall as a battlefield, and Pasteur took the laboratory as a battlefield; this seems to conform to the principle of "Join Hands." Now, we should pay attention to Chinese history and principles, increase the publication of national salvation newspapers, widely listen to foreign news, and provide more children's books. If we talk about it this way, then scholars, farmers, workers, and merchants, every action they take, will strive to improve from their respective positions, and actively participate within their scope, all with the spirit of facing the national crisis. Even the infant in arms, who will be an obligated soldier in twenty years, must also be cultivated with the spirit of facing the national crisis. Moreover, if we talk about it this way, then no college, no department, no program in the school is not set up to face the national crisis. Thus, we must recognize "studying for the national crisis, and using studying to save the crisis." If one school is like this, then all schools in the country are like this, universities are like this, and primary and secondary schools are also like this. In the past, when French Emperor Napoleon returned victoriously, he attributed his success to the primary school teachers. What primary school teachers ever joined the volunteer army? What did they ever go to buy airplanes? However, Napoleon believed that "these are the ones who are joining hands in the national crisis!" If this statement can be explained, then the spirit of the academic community joining hands in the national crisis lies in the lecture hall and the laboratory. And for the professors, if every subject and department contains elements of saving the national crisis, then the students will have much more interest in "studying for the national crisis." This may be one aspect of establishing the standards for national salvation? I hope the knowledgeable will criticize it.</p>
<p>Recently, the phrase "Long-term Resistance" is commonly used. According to my humble understanding, it simply means "Indefinite Resistance." Indefinite means lifelong and generational. With the national crisis so severe and the imperialists so cruel, can we expect to achieve peace in a predictable period? Can we simply treat the symptom and then take a vacation? There must be indefinite worry, and there must be indefinite concern. After the European War, the German people's spirit of resistance was based on extremely new science and extremely old morality. Their poverty was close to desperation, but their education program was higher than before the war, and their mortality was lower than before the war. My teachers! My teachers! Our people should take the German people after the war as a model, and our academic community should take the German academic community after the war as a model. This is also a reference material in the standards for national salvation.</p>
<p>Recently, regarding the slogan "Awaken the Masses," according to my humble understanding, there should be practical requirements: (1) Universal literacy and unified language, especially south of the Yellow River, the masses must recognize both the National Phonetic Alphabet and the Romanization phonetic symbols, which is the spiritual awakening; (2) Forest, fuel, salt, fishing, disaster relief, farming, silkworm weaving skills, everyone should strive for progress and improvement, which is the material awakening. Lead the people to diligence, each person working one hour extra each day for the national crisis, each day able to invent one or two national products. Lead the people to thrift, each person contributing one cent to the country each day for the national crisis, then each day able to purchase a certain number of airplanes. Moreover, to "awaken the masses," one must first "awaken the scholars themselves."</p>
<p>Looking back at the September 18th Incident, matters are related to expelling the barbarians, and students' actions should be coordinated. A single pillar is not as easy to lift as many supporting it, and the original vitality cannot exist alone without public opinion. People are the knives and chopping boards, and we are the fish and meat. Future prosperity depends on the students who are rich in youth and strength, and the future path depends on the students who study and think. In terms of the people, it is like a family where four people die in a year and a half, and the family sometimes wails, and no one can dislike their annoyance. In terms of land, it is like a family's house, where four rooms are burned down in a year and a half, especially the rooms that store clothes and treasures. If someone in the family complains and regrets, no one can blame their ignorance. Only if the new and old scholars of the whole country quickly establish standards for national salvation, then the country will not be saved and learning will be abandoned. The more learning is abandoned, the more the country cannot be saved. Wasting one day of the nation's students' time, the loss is greater than hundreds of millions of war expenses. Moreover, I fear that strange things will happen in the future, which are unimaginable. Even the saints like Wei Zi and Ji Zi feigned madness, and the talented like Qu Yuan and Song Yu spoke nonsense. At the end of the corrupt government of the former Qing Dynasty, there were those who were known for throwing themselves into the sea, and in the provincial meetings, there were those who were known for remonstrating with their lives; the army of the three forces can be seized by cunning, but the will of a commoner cannot be moved by gold and stone; to prevent fire, one should bend the chimney, and to prevent floods, one should open the channel; this is the greatest merit and immortal cause. I humbly hope that those with great learning and high expectations will choose some of the mad and foolish words, then it will be very fortunate!</p>

<h3>Guangdong Province Secondary School Graduation Joint Examination</h3>
<p>The Examination Committee Organized by the Department is Responsible for Handling</p>
<p>The Questions and Examinations Emphasize the Actual Situation of Each School</p>
<p>For the Sake of Expediency, the Grading Standard for the Joint Examination is Temporarily Determined</p>
<p>The Student Request to Cancel the Joint Examination Has Subsided</p>
<p>After the Guangdong Provincial Department of Education received the order from the Ministry of Education to handle the Guangdong Provincial Secondary School Graduation Joint Examination, it immediately drafted the Provisional Regulations for the Guangdong Provincial Secondary School Graduation Joint Examination and submitted it to the Provincial Government Meeting for deliberation and approval. It also issued an order to all counties and cities in the province and all secondary schools to comply. At the same time, the Provincial Department of Education organized the Guangdong Provincial Secondary School Graduation Joint Examination Committee to handle all matters. In addition to a few committee members concurrently serving as staff members of the Department of Education, the rest were all invited experts in education and principals of various schools in the province to assist. In the future, the invited committee members will be responsible for the work of setting questions and grading papers, etc. As for the county and city levels, they will handle the examination publicly, and the methods will be the same as those in the provincial capital. The test questions will be drafted by the committee, strictly sealed and mailed, and the test papers will also be prepared and numbered by the Department of Education and distributed. After the joint examination is completed, the test papers will be sealed and mailed to the committee for compilation and grading. This matter is currently in progress. The current senior high school graduates have many doubts about this graduation joint examination. Several schools have initiated the organization of a general meeting of secondary schools under the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Municipal Department of Education to request the cancellation of this joint examination, and on the 5th, they sent representatives to the Department of Education to express their opinions in person. After the Director of the Department of Education, Xie Yingzhou, explained it well, he said that the Department of Education had to quickly hold the graduation joint examination in order to implement the orders of higher authorities and to improve and standardize the level of graduating students. This joint examination will be handled in accordance with the standards of the Ministry's order, but in order to take into account the actual situation of various schools in the province, the Graduation Joint Examination Committee has decided on the standard for this joint examination. It will gradually increase the level year by year. Therefore, several months ago, the schools were ordered to truthfully report the textbooks and curriculum schedules used by each school for each subject over the past three years, and the questions and examinations will be based on the actual situation of each school. After Xie answered the students' representatives' doubts in detail, the students' representatives left one after another, and the request to cancel the joint examination had subsided to a certain extent. Until the 11th, Director Xie Yingzhou of the Department of Education convened the principals and academic directors of the secondary schools under the jurisdiction of the Department to hold a meeting in the Department to report on the progress of the joint examination. Xie attended the meeting and made the following points: (1) A total of more than 9,400 students participated in this secondary school graduation joint examination, with more than 60,000 test papers. It will not be possible to handle the examination without a large number of invigilators and graders. It is hoped that the schools will quickly list the names of the teachers so that the Department can separately send special letters to invite them to be invigilators and graders. (2) Regarding the setting of questions, it will be based on the actual situation of each school. The Department has issued an order to all schools to report their curriculum and subject progress, but most of them have not yet complied. The Joint Examination Committee has specially collected textbooks of various subjects issued by various bookstores and sent them to the question-setting committee members for reference, asking them to propose questions based on the common and important parts of each textbook. (3) Grading standards. The Ministry of Education has not yet clearly stipulated the grading standards for this joint examination. Before receiving the Ministry's order, the Provincial Department of Education will temporarily formulate a temporary method. The grades for this graduation joint examination will be based on 60% for the usual grades and 40% for the joint examination grades. This will be used as the standard for future calculations. This is an expedient measure. If the Ministry of Education has regulations in the future, then it will be handled in accordance with the Ministry's order.</p>

In the autumn of 1926, when Jiaotong University discontinued its middle and elementary school divisions, it was reorganized into the private Nanyang Model Middle and Elementary School. However, junior high school graduates were still sent to Jiaotong University's preparatory courses for further study. In the autumn of 1930, when Jiaotong University discontinued its preparatory courses, the school then established a senior high school division. Currently, the school's first graduating class of senior high school students includes Long Jihe, Xu Mingfu, Shen Qixian, Li Chaobei, Shen Bingzhong, Shan Ji, Xu Jun, Wu Huaqing, Yao Yongyao, Zhou Ren, Xie Shidong, Wen Qi, Ye Hongcai, Ma Changqian, Nai Yi, Zhu Guo Hong, Cheng Liang Sheng, Liu Shaoyu, Jin Yongguang, Wu Shutang, Wang Yizhi, Deng Qing, Zhou Baoguang, Shao Jihua, Qi Zhou, Yang Shuguo, Mao Chu'en, Xue Wenxiu, Xue Jinshou, Zhao Benchu, Xie Shixiao, and Li Zaitian, thirty-three students in total. They formally established an alumni association the day before yesterday and elected Deng Xiangjun, Wu Huaqing, Wu Shutang, Yang Shuguo, and Shen Qixian as committee members. It is reported that the current membership qualification for the association is limited to graduates of the school's senior high school division.</p>
<p>This City's Boy Scouts Prepare to Participate in the</p>
<h3>Second National Jamboree</h3>
<p>Registration Procedures Are Almost Completed</p>
<p>The National Boy Scouts will hold the Second National Jamboree in Zhenjiang on Double Tenth Day. The Shanghai Boy Scouts Council has prepared to participate at that time. According to council member Wang Gang, speaking to reporters, because the National Boy Scouts have not registered for four years, the total number is currently impossible to calculate, but it is estimated to be around 60,000. Shanghai has more than 4,000 Boy Scouts. The headquarters of the Chinese Boy Scouts has notified Boy Scouts nationwide to begin registration, which is scheduled to end at the end of September. The deadline is imminent, and it is difficult to determine whether it can be held on schedule. The Shanghai side has already begun preparations to participate, and the registration procedures are almost completed and will be reported in the next few days.</p>
<h3>Shanxi Education Institute Visiting Delegation Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Shanxi was once known as a model province. Although it has been affected by the economic downturn in recent years, the provincial schools are actively progressing. Yesterday, a visiting delegation from the Education Institute of Shanxi University, including Li Shian, Nan Guorui, Zheng Jinyun, Zhang Xiangheng, Liu Fuxian, Zhang Jingzhen, Chen Xiaoping, Hou Deyuan, Guo Chengnan, and Qin Rui, arrived in Shanghai from Hangzhou for a visit. They are staying at the Taian Zhan. In recent days, the Commercial Press has hosted banquets and led them to visit Wuben, Wanzhu, Shangzhong, Xicheng, and Minjiao Hall. They were satisfied with the equipment and teaching methods. However, because the schools are currently engaged in major exams, the delegation changed its plans to visit various cultural institutions.</p>
<h3>Standing Committee of the Chinese Secondary School Teachers' Union Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Sanctioning Illegal Groups Who Sabotage the Joint Entrance Examination</p>
<p>(Shanghai News Agency) The Standing Committee of the Shanghai Secondary School Teachers' Union issued the following statement yesterday regarding the recent secondary school joint entrance examination: It has been found that the recent municipal secondary school joint entrance examination was suspended midway due to the leakage of test questions. Fortunately, the education authorities have handled the matter properly. In addition to a thorough investigation and transfer to the court for investigation and punishment, the truth will soon be revealed. At the same time, all secondary schools were ordered to conduct a final exam for the graduating students of this year, covering all unfinished subjects, which was held the day before yesterday (the 24th) by the chief examiners at the schools. Most students participated in the examination, and the order was quite good. However, students from several schools were coerced and controlled by a small number of students who organized themselves into a "vigilante team" and were unable to hold the exams, which is regrettable. The joint entrance examination system is a matter of national policy and has been repeatedly ordered by the Ministry of Education to be held. The local education authorities in Shanghai were ordered to organize a joint entrance examination committee to be responsible for handling the municipal joint entrance examination. Unfortunately, the leakage of questions occurred, which caused misunderstandings among the general public or even took the opportunity to instigate and attempt to sabotage the process. It is also heard that private groups are secretly active, using students as their tools, which misleads the future of young people and violates national laws. There is nothing more serious than this. The colleagues of this union, who are teachers, have already expressed their views on this issue. For the current remedial measures, it is hoped that the students who have not taken the exam will come to their senses and prioritize their academic future, and immediately request the Bureau of Education to schedule a make-up exam. At the same time, it is hoped that the Bureau of Education will consider the students' situation and give them an opportunity to rehabilitate themselves within the scope of the law. Students who gather to coerce others should be severely punished, and those who intentionally sabotage the joint entrance examination system should also be sanctioned. This matter concerns the future of education and national law, and it should not be neglected.</p>

<h3>Recent News from the China Accounting Correspondence School</h3>
<p>The China Accounting Correspondence School, located at 1154 Xinzha Road, Shanghai, was founded by renowned accountant Shen Liren. The internal organization is extremely sound, and the professors are mostly well-known accounting experts in the country. In addition to Shen serving as principal and planning everything, there are also six university professors and seven well-known accountants who share teaching responsibilities. The courses are divided into Bookkeeping, Elementary Accounting, Bookkeeping and Elementary Accounting Practice, Advanced Accounting, Cost Accounting, Auditing, Accounting System Design, and Bank Bookkeeping, Government Accounting, and other subjects. Therefore, although the teaching method is correspondence, the subjects taught are equivalent to a specialized university. The content of the school's lectures emphasizes both theory and practice. Graduates who serve in society are always able to use what they have learned and cope with ease. The school's academic system adopts an individual system, and there are no restrictions on the period of study. It is up to the students to study independently and read at their own pace. Therefore, those who graduate quickly are in the majority, and there are also those who are delayed for several years due to various reasons. However, the school treats everyone equally and does not show any weariness due to the long delays.</p>

<h3>Zhengshi Middle School Expands Greatly</h3>
<p>Zhengshi Middle School on Route Tenant de la Tour in the French Concession of Shanghai was founded by Du Yuesheng. The school strives for perfection in all kinds of facilities. The teachers and staff are all well-known figures of the time. Over the past two years, more than 100,000 yuan has been spent. The management is well-organized, and the coursework is serious. Recently, because the original school building was insufficient, a second school building was added nearby, with a spacious playground and sports field. Construction is currently underway, and a major expansion is planned. It is expected to be available next semester. The tuition fees charged by the school were already cheaper than elsewhere. Recently, it was stipulated that the fees would be reduced by four yuan per semester to ease the burden on parents. Students in each class who achieve excellent results and rank at the top can also be exempted from tuition fees to encourage them.</p>

<h3>There is Confidence in Winning the Championship Never Before Achieved. Chinese Tennis Club Heavily Defeats Japan</h3>
<p>10-5 The Performances of the First and Second Groups Were Wonderful and They Achieved Total Victory</p>
<p>The Chinese Club Occupies an Extremely Advantageous Position in the Scoring Table</p>
<p>Tomorrow Facing a Strong Enemy: The Japanese Naigaiwata Factory</p>
<p>In the United Shanghai Lawn Tennis Association's combined competition, the Chinese Tennis Club defeated the Japanese Tennis Club by a score of ten to five yesterday, the team having won the championship for the last three years. The Chinese Club now has even more hope of winning the league championship, a title they have never achieved before. The match was originally scheduled for Wednesday, but it was postponed due to rain. The makeup match was held yesterday, and many people went to the Sports Association Road to watch. Philippine stars Chiavia and Salin Dan were also present. All the warriors of the Chinese Club were present, but Jiang Daozhang did not come. Tu Kaiyuan has returned from Manila, so the lineup has changed slightly. Both the first and second groups won straight sets, but the third and fourth groups were defeated by a score of one to two, so the score was not as high as expected, which is a shame. This also shows the abundance of Japanese doubles talent. Tomorrow the Chinese Club will also have a big battle against the Naigaiwata Factory. The results of the five groups yesterday are as follows:</p>
<h3>Old Jiang's Absence Affected the Score</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the absence of veteran Jiang Daozhang greatly affected the score. As a result, the strength of the third, fourth, and fifth groups was reduced, especially the fourth and fifth groups. Otherwise, if Jiang was in the third group, they could have won completely, and the fourth and fifth groups would have been able to score one or two more points. It is hoped that he will attend tomorrow and fight the Naigaiwata Factory.</p>
<h3>Zheng Zhaojia Worked Especially Hard</h3>
<p>The match between Lin and Zheng against Noguchi and Hisashige in the first group was the most noticeable and the most exciting. Zheng Zhaojia was especially outstanding. His serve was slightly improved, and his forecourt volley was fast and powerful, leaving the enemy helpless. His net interception was unmatched throughout the game, and his diagonal long shot was accurate and fast. Lin Maihua was average, but his hits were especially careful and not sloppy at all.</p>
<h3>The First Group's Fierce Battle</h3>
<p>Although Noguchi and Hisashige are not famous, their doubles skills are still commendable. Lin and Zheng are not as good at high balls. In the first set, they often used extremely stable high balls to prevent Lin and Zheng from getting close to the net, and then advanced to mid-court to launch fierce volleys. The Japanese team served first and won a game. Then, the server won until the score became four to four. Lin and Zheng defeated the Japanese serve in the ninth game to take a 5-4 lead. Unexpectedly, in the tenth game, when Zheng Zhaojia was serving, Lin Baohua hit the net twice in a row at the net, making the score 5-5. Then, they still won with a score of 7-5. In the second and third sets, Lin and Zheng were even better. They won all six games in the second set, and the Japanese only won the first and seventh games in the third set.</p>
<h3>The Second Group Also Won</h3>
<p>Qian Yaobin and Qiu Feihai paired up. Their opponent, the Oka team, was a doubles powerhouse. Thinking that Qian could be deceived, they attacked Yaobin alone, but Yaobin also paid special attention. His high balls were very good, and Lao Qiu was still as good as ever. The Japanese team lost because many of their kills touched the net. As a result, the Japanese only won two games, 6-2, 1-6, and 0-6. 0-6 was one of the first groups to finish.</p>
<h3>The Fourth Group Lost After a Fierce Battle</h3>
<p>Liang Degguang and Yu Tianguang matched well and cooperated well, winning with scores of 6-1, 4-6, and 6-2. The fifth group lost by a score of one to two. The combined score of the first, second, third, and fifth groups was nine to three. When the other groups had finished, the fourth group was still fighting hard. After each group won a set, the third set was getting late. Sun Linfang was still steady, but it is a pity that his cooperation with Tu needs improvement. Tu was already showing fatigue. After several ties, they finally lost the third set with a score of 8-10.</p>
<h3>Tomorrow Fighting the Naigaiwata Factory</h3>
<p>Tomorrow, the Chinese Club will fight against the Japanese Naigaiwata Factory. The Naigaiwata is very strong and has defeated the Japanese Club with a score of ten to five, losing only one point with a score of seven to one. Therefore, everyone still needs to work hard to cope with it, and the lineup must be carefully considered. The strength of the fourth and fifth groups must be increased. If they can defeat the Naigaiwata, there will be no problem. Tomorrow's court is on Haig Road, or it may be changed to the Chinese Tennis Court, which has not yet been decided.</p>
<h3>Recent Results of Each Team</h3>
<p>Team Name Played Won Lost Score</p>

<h3>Japan Decides on Expenses</h3>
<p>Totaling 188,000 Yen</p>
<p>(Tokyo News) The Japan Sports Association held a board meeting at the Tokyo Marunouchi office on the 14th of this month. Those present included Chairman Kishi, Vice Chairman Hiranuma, Honorary Secretary-General Takashima, Honorary Accountant Ogawa, and each executive director. It was decided that the Japan Sports Association would officially send athletes to participate in the 10th Far Eastern Games to be held in the Philippines next year, and the association's accounting department's budget for dispatching athletes, totaling 188,000 yen, was approved. Of this, 68,000 yen will be raised by the Japan Sports Association itself, and the remaining 120,000 yen will be requested from the Japanese government as a subsidy on the 16th of this month.</p>
<p>Chinese Swimming Association</p>
<h3>Guidance Department Offers Free Swimming Instruction</h3>
<p>The Chinese Swimming Research Association is building a heated swimming pool so that swimming enthusiasts can practice all year round and create good talent. Since it began recruiting members, more than 200 people have enthusiastically joined and the results have been good. However, it is difficult to find a location with low rent and convenient transportation, so it has been repeatedly delayed. Each committee member, entrusted by the conference, is very anxious. Although they have been running around in many ways and carrying out negotiations everywhere, there is a plot of land of two acres near the Jiangwan Road Animal and Plant Company, with an annual rent of 300. Because of the need to consider the members' transportation, they have not dared to make a decision. Near Tiantong'an, there is a plot of land of one acre, with an annual rent of 600. Because the rent is too high, it has also not been decided. Near the Daji Road public sports field, there is a plot of land of one acre, with rent not counted, which is the most suitable. However, the owner and the tenant have not cleared the procedures and have a dispute. Recently, near the Penglai Market, there is a vacant lot of two acres, with the most convenient transportation, which is the most promising and most suitable place for the association to proceed. However, the weather has been very hot recently, and swimming must not be delayed. The association has appointed instructors to go to the pool to guide members on Tuesdays and Fridays after 5 pm, to assist in practice. However, the association has always embraced the goal of promoting and popularizing swimming. If individuals, groups, or schools from outside need free instruction, they can contact Yu Binqi and Wang Jianxin at 9 Sanma Road, Shanghai.</p>

<p>Special</p>
<h3>General Overview of the First Year After the Great War (8)</h3>
<p>(6) Promoting Academic Research and Encouraging Publications</p>
<p>President Zheng believed that in recent years, young people in general have not been grounded, not earnestly studying, and are becoming increasingly frivolous and superficial. The future consequences of this trend would be harmful and not beneficial to the country, society, and themselves. Therefore, he adopted the strictest training for the students of this school, to cultivate talents suitable for practical application. At the same time, he promoted academic research, encouraging students to strive in academics, so as to create an academic atmosphere that promotes scholarship. Therefore, regardless of the financial difficulties of the school, any student group or individual who wishes to publish a publication that possesses one of the following qualities may have it printed for free by the school's printing office: 1. A work that contributes to scholarship; 2. A translation of a famous work; 3. A periodical, either regular or irregular, that promotes scholarship and is related to overseas Chinese education. As a result, the number of academic organizations in the school has increased to more than thirty in the past year. In addition to the school publications compiled by the Secretariat (now under the Academic Affairs Committee), the "Nanyang Information" and "Nanyang Research" compiled by the Nanyang Cultural Enterprise Department, "Education and Life" compiled by the Department of Education, the "Twenty-Year Overview of the Library" compiled by the Hong Nian Library, "Jinan Life" compiled by the former Training Committee, and "Zheng Hongnian's Educational Remarks During the National Crisis in the Past Year" compiled by the former Printing Group, the academic organizations have published more than a dozen publications such as "Education Creation," "Nanyang Wind," "Nanyang Star Society Publication," "Songtao Weekly," "Chu Voice," "Jiangxi Academic Publication," "Academic Monthly," "New Zhenru," "Microwave," and "Tomorrow." There are also several publications that will be published soon, such as the "Wenju Series of Publications," "Science and Philosophy Publications," and "Student Union Quarterly." As for the lecture notes compiled by the teaching staff in the past year, they have been completed. The completed works that can be compiled into books include "Selections of Ancient and Modern Poetry," "Public Finance," "History of Chinese Literature," "Mass Education," "World Economic Geography," "History of Eastern Countries," "Selections of Ci Poetry from Past Dynasties," "General History of China," "On Population," "Ancient Social History," "Social Investigation and Experimentation," "General Discussion of Social Undertakings," "Philology," "International Relations," "The British Government," "Studies in Capitalism," "Experimental Psychology," "Outline of Cooperation," "Developmental Psychology," "Modern Novels," "Railway Transportation," "Composition Methods of Northern and Southern Operas," "Bookkeeping Lecture Notes," "Health," "Problems of Secondary Education," "European Continental Governments," and "Railway Finance," among dozens of others.</p>
<p>The large number of publications published in the past year at this school, due to the enthusiastic promotion of academics by President Zheng, can be confidently said to be the best among all universities. Given a suitable period of time, there will surely be considerable achievements, adding a glorious chapter to the academic world of our country.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned six points are the most obvious achievements of this school in the past year since the war. In addition, the Nanyang American Cultural Undertakings Department's research and contributions to Nanyang issues and the problems of overseas Chinese around the world, and the effectiveness of the strict management and education adopted by the secondary school department, have been discussed in separate articles. This article will not repeat them. However, because the author has too many official duties, this draft was hastily prepared, and omissions are inevitable. I hope that readers will forgive and correct them. June 10, the twenty-second year of the Republic of China (End)</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>On Antiques</h3>
<p>— Feng Wu</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou Zuoren's "Yao Lu Chi Du" expresses deep regret that the professors will move south with the antiques. I think this is quite unnecessary. If they can truly be escorted south like antiques, without being held in Beiping City to watch airplanes and suffer fear, the common people who have no way to go already envy them enough. To still say "regret," isn't that strange?</p>
<p>In this day and age, apart from antiques, it can be said that there is very little of value. Don't you see, a few months ago, a Shanghai newspaper reported that someone cheated a friend out of a small statue, and because it was sculpted by Wu Daozi of the Tang Dynasty, it could be sold for one million yuan. However, a dignified and authoritative Ph.D. is worth no more than five thousand yuan in the stock market. As an ancient poem says, "Don't believe that the dead are better than the living." Now, living people and the dead are no match for antiques.</p>
<p>Antiques, like people, also have unlucky periods, but these periods are ultimately not long. For example, a few years ago, Wu Zhihui wanted to throw thread-bound books into the outhouse. Now, not only are old bookstores treating them as rare commodities, raising prices, but they have also become very fashionable politically. A few days ago, Guangdong had already issued a reading classics decree, and one party also said that teaching materials must focus on propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame, filial piety, brotherly love, loyalty, and trustworthiness. From this alone, it can be imagined that ancient books, like the sun and moon traversing the sky and rivers flowing on the earth, although they may sometimes be obscured by floating clouds, are ultimately occasional occurrences. How are other antiques any different? When living in the same garden as Sage Kang, I often saw him transporting books out. It turned out that he had opened a used bookstore on Sanma Road and was selling them there. A friend of mine, a pastor, used to love collecting antiques, but now he is the owner of an antique shop. I therefore suddenly realized that antiques are not only elegant but also have great profits. This "profit" of course includes super-economic benefits. Looking at the "Complete Library in Four Sections Photographic Print Contract" signed by the Central Library and the Commercial Press, you can believe that my words are not groundless.</p>
<p>Because antiques are so precious, everyone, whether wise or foolish, virtuous or unworthy, has a fondness for them. Yue Fei certainly wrote beautiful calligraphy and even wrote a collection of poems. Even Qin Hui, who opposed him and is now kneeling by his grave, was also a lover of antiques. According to Li Rihua's "Wei Shui Xuan Diary" of the Ming Dynasty, on November 13 of the thirty-seventh year of Wanli (Ji You), he saw a painting with "a seal with the character 'Hui' and a seal of 'Qin's Book Collection.'" Therefore, people who love antiques are not necessarily virtuous, and virtuous people do not necessarily have antiques.</p>
<p>Thinking of antiques, I can't help but think of China's empty treasury. I feel that if antiques were also levied for donations, wouldn't that be a large sum of money? When the manure tax caused a storm, and the leaflet collection fee was charged, merchants shouted "Cancel the leaflet fee to alleviate merchant difficulties" (Nanjing Telegram, Shen Bao, 21st). Collecting donations on antiques should not cause any reaction. I dare to offer this suggestion to the relevant authorities.</p>
<h3>Dusk After the Storm</h3>
<p>— Xie Bingying</p>
<p>It was dusk after the storm, and I came to the banks of the flooded river.</p>
<p>For two weeks, it had been raining continuously, and the river water had risen level with the dikes, only two feet away from the newly built bridge. The surging waves were like thousands of troops and horses galloping. Although the river water was a pale yellow turbid color, the snow-like white waves were so majestic and beautiful!</p>
<p>Two middle-aged women were sitting on the stone steps of the riverbank, washing clothes. They were people who were used to this kind of wave life. Although the waves splashed all over them and wet their 18th-century wooden-soled high-heeled shoes, they were not flustered or stingy at all. They just calmly washed their clothes. The rhythmic sound of pounding clothes and the loud sound of the waves played the evening song of early summer together. A fisherman with a fishing rod and bamboo hat walked from the other side of the bridge, and from his satisfied expression, it seemed that he had had a considerable harvest. Groups of three or five farmers returning from the fields and male and female coolies carrying burdens returning from the city to the countryside sang ditties and walked happily and leisurely across this plank bridge that had been broken by the flood two days ago.</p>
<p>Several wooden rafts, carrying a large group of egrets, were being poled through the waves by a child of about thirteen or fourteen years old.</p>
<p>A little chicken pecked up a little green frog and was about to eat it when another chicken saw it and hurriedly ran over to snatch it from its mouth. A third chicken saw it and snatched it from the second chicken's mouth. The first chicken then grabbed it back. The third and fourth chickens then rushed over, and they snatched it so chaotically that the little frog was not swallowed into anyone's stomach.</p>
<p>"Ah, is this the struggle for survival? Or is it a symbol of Chinese warlords seizing territory?"</p>
<p>Just as the second batch of little chicken warriors were joining the battle, a big rooster came over. It clucked and unceremoniously pecked away the frog.</p>
<p>The owner of the big and little chickens came out. This was an old woman with white hair and three-inch golden lotuses. She spread out her hands and chased the chickens back into the coop. Then the frog, which had been sacrificed in the struggle, was abandoned on the road to be trampled on. The setting sun gradually sank in the west, the evening wind began to work, and the sound of the river changed from loud to sharp. The cool breeze brushed past my hair and blew through my heart. Facing the sky that was spreading a black curtain and looking at the vast and hazy clouds and mountains, I exhaled a long breath.</p>
<p>Ah, it's time to go back!</p>
<h3>Re-discussing Gongs and Drums</h3>
<p>— He Ru</p>
<p>I recently saw Mr. Luo Fu's new interpretation of gongs and drums in old operas, and I have already learned his self-proclaimed unique interpretation. Some of it involves my previous discussion, so I will elaborate slightly to show that I had already considered what Mr. Luo Fu suspected.</p>
<p>The new interpretation says, "When will the *jiao di bai xi* (角　百戲) truly merge with Chinese opera like water and milk? When did gongs and drums officially enter our old operas?" Mr. He Ru inevitably let these questions go easily. It seems that Mr. Luo Fu would not easily let go of this question and has a new interpretation, but after reading the following, I can't help but be disappointed. He only cited the old words of Gu Qiyuan's "Ke Zuo Zhui Yu" as proof. In fact, I have used Gu's theory to prove the rise and fall of northern and southern melodies (see the latest issue of Qingnian Jie), but not to discuss gongs and drums, because what he calls *san yue* (散樂) is similar to what we now call *qing chang* (淸唱, a cappella singing), which naturally does not require gongs and drums. What he calls "large-scale plays" should be formal performances, but he only mentions *cuo dian quan* (撮墊圈), dancing Guanyin, or *bai zhang qi* (百丈旗), or *die dui zi* (跌隊子), without mentioning music. It's not that there is no music, so it cannot prove that northern melodies only have martial arts performances without gongs and drums. Moreover, northern melodies have long declined, and it is difficult to find documentation. It is not easy to have convincing evidence without resurrecting the people of the Jin and Yuan dynasties from the underworld. As for Gu's discussion of southern singing, I don't know if he is referring to the so-called *xiao ji san yue* (小集散樂, small gatherings for amateur performances) or the so-called "large-scale plays." His mention of musical instruments does not include gongs and drums, or he only mentions a cappella singing, so gongs and drums are not used, or he only mentions the main musical instrument, and other instruments are not fully listed, which is all unknown. Moreover, although Kunqu opera is said to have become *Guang Ling San* (廣陵散, a lost tune), it is not completely extinct, and there are occasional connoisseurs. For example, Mr. Tong Fumin, the author of "Research on New and Old Operas," in his discussion of the organization and performance methods of Kunqu opera, said that "in terms of the orchestra, the lead vocals are mainly accompanied by flutes and suonas, and they are directed by *dan pi* (單皮, a type of drum) and clappers. The flutes are assisted by strings, pipa, sheng, moon lute, nine-tone gongs, and *huai gu* (懷鼓, a small drum). The suonas are assisted by *tang gu* (堂鼓, a large drum), large drums, small gongs, large cymbals, small cymbals, *qi bo* (齊鈸, cymbals played together), and *hai di* (海笛, a type of flute)." Furthermore, in his "On the Transformation of Kunqu Opera," he said, "Since the original elements of Kunqu opera include bleak military music, the dryness and烦燥 of military music are not suitable for peace-loving nations, so they should be analyzed and separated. Therefore, *nao* (鐃, small cymbals), cymbals, suonas, large gongs, etc., should not be used, and must be replaced with other musical instruments." The claim that Kunqu opera uses gongs and drums is not something I fabricated. Moreover, Li Yu personally witnessed the existence of Kunqu opera and already had a comment that gongs and drums should not be mixed in. Mr. Luo Fu said that "southern melodies did not use gongs and drums at first." This is truly a so-called new interpretation. However, how can Gu Qiyuan's old words, whose original meaning is vague, be sufficient as proof? As for saying that Li Yu's theory "was issued at the time of the decline of Kunqu opera," this is the biggest omission in my argument. I truly don't know where the omission is.</p>
<p>Mr. Luo Fu has already admitted that "Chinese opera originates from *jiao di* (角觝, ancient wrestling) and *bai xi* (百戲, a variety show), which is the 'Three Character Classic' of Chinese opera history. Our old operas do not abandon martial arts performances and gongs and drums because *jiao di wu shu* (角觝武術, wrestling martial arts) must have drums to indicate advance and retreat and to enhance the solemnity of the performance." This is also an indisputable argument. Fortunately, he has understood the basis of my previous argument, so there is no need to discuss it further. As for saying, "Since Mr. He Ru admits that drums invaded old operas at the same time as martial arts performances, why does he assert that Chinese opera must use gongs and drums, as if gongs and drums have been inseparable from drama since drama existed, without realizing that their arrival, like martial arts performances, is forced to move within old operas?" This must be explained separately. When I said that Chinese opera must use gongs and drums, I was imitating Dr. Mei's answer to Mr. Xiao, which was a joke, not to defend the existence of gongs and drums. A review of my argument will show this. Moreover, I did not say that "gongs and drums invaded old operas at the same time as martial arts performances." I have never had this absurd statement in my previous argument, and I am not prepared to admit it now. I respectfully return it to him. I only said that "since drama existed, it has been inseparable from gongs and drums." This is also based on old sayings, the "Three Character Classic" that everyone knows, but I dare not label it as a new interpretation.</p>
<p>The "Old Book of Tang," volume 29, "Treatise on Music II," first mentions *san yue jiao di bai xi* (散樂角觝百戲), and then mentions the song and dance plays of that time, including "Da Mian" (大面, Great Mask), "Bo Tou" (撥頭, Throwing Head), "Ta Yao Niang" (踏搖娘, Stepping and Shaking Woman), and "Cu Lei Zi" (　壘子). "Da Mian" is also called "Dai Mian" (代面, Masked Performance). The same book says, "Dai Mian originated in the Northern Qi Dynasty. Lanling King Chang Gong of the Northern Qi Dynasty was talented and martial, but his face was beautiful, so he often wore a mask to face the enemy. He once attacked the Zhou army under the walls of Jinyong City and was the bravest of the three armies. The people of Qi praised him for this and created this dance to imitate his gestures and attacks, calling it 'Lanling King Enters the Battle Song.'" Mr. Wang Guowei said in his "History of Song and Yuan Opera": "In ancient times, actors only used singing, dancing, and joking as their means. Since the Han Dynasty, they have occasionally performed stories. Combining singing and dancing to perform an event truly began in the Northern Qi Dynasty. However, the event was very simple, and rather than calling it a play, it would be more appropriate to call it a dance. However, the source of later dramas truly began here." It can be seen that the initial formation of Chinese opera began with the song and dance dramas of the Northern Qi Dynasty to the Tang Dynasty, such as "Dai Mian." The performers of the "Dai Mian" song wore masks, already possessing the form of facial makeup. Imitating the gestures and attacks of battle was already similar to what we now call martial arts performances. Unfortunately, history does not record the musical instruments that accompanied the singing and dancing. Perhaps they also used gongs and drums to indicate advance and retreat and to enhance the solemnity of the performance, truly imitating ancient warfare? What I call Chinese opera, which is inseparable from gongs and drums and martial arts performances, besides *jiao di bai xi*, is also an aid to my theory. However, I still dare not label it as a new interpretation, boasting of my originality.</p>
<p>Finally, what needs to be solemnly stated is that I am not defending gongs and drums and martial arts performances, but only trying to understand their historical origins. Originally, I was playing with ideas and writing a meaningless article, but I didn't expect it to elicit so many new interpretations from Mr. Luo Fu. Tossing a brick to attract jade, I have already received much praise, so I am happy to write this re-discussion. However, both my first and second arguments lack new interpretations and mistakenly occupy the valuable space of "Free Talk," wasting the valuable time of readers. This is something I am very apprehensive and uneasy about, and there is nothing I can do about it.</p>
<h3>Carrot Top</h3>
<p>— Written by Jules Renard, Translated by Lin Qu</p>
<p>The Final Words (Continued)</p>
<p>Carrot Top knew that Lepic had chosen this method to invite him. He also stood up, took the chair to the wall as usual, and obediently followed his father.</p>
<p>At first, they walked in silence. The inevitable question was not asked immediately. Carrot Top was guessing the question in his heart and planning how to answer. He was already prepared. He had been shaken very violently in his heart, but he didn't regret anything. Since he had had such emotion during the day, he was not afraid of a more violent one coming. Moreover, Lepic's tone of voice, when he finally decided to speak, also reassured him.</p>
<p>Lepic: Why haven't you explained to me the kind of behavior that made your mother feel uncomfortable just now?</p>
<p>Carrot Top: My dear Dad, I hesitated for a long time, but I finally couldn't bear it anymore. I can confess this: I no longer like Mom.</p>
<p>Lepic: Ah! Why? Since when?</p>
<p>Carrot Top: For all the reasons. Since I knew her.</p>
<p>Lepic: Ah! That's really unfortunate, my child! At least tell me where she treated you badly.</p>
<p>Carrot Top: It's impossible to finish telling it all at once. And, haven't you noticed it at all?</p>
<p>Lepic: Yes. I often see you getting angry.</p>
<p>Carrot Top: When I hear others say I'm angry, I can't help but get even more angry. Of course, Carrot Top can't seriously hold grudges. He gets angry. Let him get angry. When he wakes up from his anger, he will be quiet, his anger will disappear, and he will appear in front of everyone. The most important thing is not to show that you care about him. This doesn't matter. Please forgive me, Dad, this doesn't matter to those fathers, mothers, and irrelevant people. I sometimes get angry, and from the outside, I admit it, but I can assure you that sometimes I get very angry with my whole heart, and I will never forget the humiliation I have suffered.</p>
<p>Lepic: Yes, yes, you will forget these pranks.</p>
<p>Carrot Top: No, no. You are home so little that you don't know everything.</p>
<p>Lepic: I can't help but be out running around.</p>
<p>Carrot Top (showing a satisfied look): Business is of course important. Dad. You are buried in your business, with no time to spare. As for Mom, she has no other dog to whip except me, so to speak. I don't dare to put this responsibility on you. Of course, I just need to be a little sneaky, and you will protect me. Since you asked me, I can slowly tell you all the things from the past. Then you will know if I have a good memory. But now, Dad, please give me an idea quickly. I want to leave my mother. In your opinion, what is the simplest method?</p>
<p>Lepic: You only see her for two months of the year during the summer vacation.</p>
<p>Carrot Top: You should allow me to stay at school during the summer vacation. I can make progress there.</p>
<p>Lepic: Spending the summer vacation at school is a favor reserved for poor children. People will despise me for letting you stay. And don't just think about yourself. There's also me. Your absence from home will make me feel incomplete.</p>
<p>Carrot Top: You can come and see me, Dad.</p>
<p>Lepic: These fun-seeking walks cost a lot of money, Carrot Top.</p>
<p>Carrot Top: Then you can take a small detour to see me when you have to go out for business.</p>
<p>Lepic: No. So far, I have treated you the same as your older brothers and sisters. I am careful not to let anyone enjoy special benefits. I will have to continue to do so in the future.</p>
<p>Carrot Top: Then, let me drop out of school. Just say that I stole your money and pull me out of school. I can choose a craft. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Financial Bulls and Bears Await Opportunities, Gold Market Maintains Quiet Attitude</h3>
<p>Rise and Fall Range Narrow, Slight Increase of One Yuan and Seven Jiao</p>
<p>The gold market was extremely flat yesterday and the day before, with limited transactions. Large investors intended to wait and see. The morning increase was less than six yuan. The market rose and then fell back. Initially, the British and American silver markets both fell, and the distant silver price squeezed by the Five Metals Exchange also shrunk the market's confidence. Although prices rose, they paid no attention. The opening price of the *mao pan* (毛盤, raw gold market) was zero point seven eight yuan, and then it rose zero point six two five due to Allen's private telegram. It gradually fell back. After the opening, it moved with the exchange rate, first low and then high. After the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation announced the exchange rate, the British rate was flat and the American rate shrunk by one point two five. The situation stabilized, and the market's confidence continued to stabilize. It once rose to more than ten yuan, but because the banks were tight and Bombay announced a long of two annas, it then rose one anna and turned downstream. Guangdong banks and Dalian banks had supply, which was a hedging strip. After the close, the rise and fall slightly declined. Overall, the day was very mediocre, and there was not much international news. The economic conference was in secret negotiations. Both bulls and bears were waiting for opportunities. The clam red price was increased by one hundred and twenty yuan. The market situation of the day will be recorded now:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 905 yuan, which was the same price as the Saturday close. The exchange rate opening was also flat. The near-term selling price was estimated to be one shilling and three pence for the British exchange rate and 26.375 yuan for the American exchange rate. Xie Xingyong sold the strip, and Huabi came out with the American dollar at 27 yuan for October, which retreated from six yuan to three yuan and six jiao. Shen Kang, Yuan Mao, Yong Yuan, and Chun Ju entered. Huabi dug out the American dollar at eight point seven five yuan for September, and Anda also wanted it, and it was seven yuan. Shanghai came out with eight point one two five yuan for September, which was slightly downstream, but because Hengyu, Zhaofeng, Changfu, Yu Zhengchang, Yuan Mao, Ruixing, etc. joined forces to purchase, it rose to nine point five yuan. Pan Gen plugged the American dollar at seven point five yuan for September, and Fuchang and Hengxing sold slightly, and it was seven yuan. Daxing Yong limited the purchase of the strip. After the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation announced the exchange rate, the British rate was flat and the American rate fell by one point two five. At this time, it hovered around eight yuan, and the market stabilized later. There were few transactions, and there was no rise or fall in the market, only scattered households and goods mutually suppressing each other, and circling for a very long time. Finally, Huabi came out with the American dollar at eight point one two five yuan for September. Qian Chang, Xiangfu, Chang, Fuchang, Yuanheng, and Tongyi sold together, and it fell to five yuan. Hongli bought tirelessly, and Richang also bought a position, so it circled back up, and because there were few opponents, it rose to more than eight yuan. In the end, because the market was sluggish, Macari also came out with the American dollar at six point two five yuan for August. Yuan Mao sold it, and the noon close was 907.6 yuan. The goods were auctioned at seven point eight jiao.</p>
<p>The afternoon opening price was zero point zero eight yuan, and the opening price for goods was seven point seven jiao. Hongli, Shunli, Yuan Mao, Yong, etc. all bought, and it rose. Although the goods were sold, they rose to 10.05 yuan because the market was stable. Huabi came out with the American dollar at six point two five yuan for August and gradually saw a decline. After entering, the banks' appetite was suppressed. Bingxing, Shunli, Qingfa, Yong, Tongyi, and Dai Hengxing all had supply. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation came out with the American dollar at seven point five yuan for September and fell to seven point one jiao. After this, the market was quiet and extremely boring. Qian Chang, Xiangfu, and Fuchang slightly purchased and rose to eight point eight jiao. Tianfeng Yong sold to seven point three jiao, but it still hovered around eight yuan. Finally, Fuyu, Chun Yuan, Yongshun, Li, etc. came to sell, and the closing price fell to 906.7 yuan. After the close, the supply suddenly became strong. Dalian banks such as Shunli and Wanxing, and Guangdong banks such as Hengxing, came to sell, and for a time it fell to the point of four yuan. However, the goods had already been auctioned for five point five yuan. Finally, Fuchang came to enter the strip, at about five point five yuan and above. Overall, the highest price of the day was 910.5 yuan, and the lowest price was 903.6 yuan, with a rise and fall of 6.9 yuan. The result was a slight increase of 1.7 yuan compared to the previous Saturday.</p>
<p>The announced price was because the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's American rate shrunk by 1.25, which was 25.875 yuan, and the combined standard gold price was over 927 yuan. According to the closing price, about 20 yuan was pressed, which was 2.5 yuan more than the previous week. The registered price for this month was 920 yuan, 918 yuan for July, and 908 yuan for August. The water replenishment in the morning was 930 yuan, and 929 yuan in the afternoon. The red-hot price was increased by 120 yuan, with no goods available in the market. Foreign banks and colleagues wanted to increase the price by 130 yuan, but there was no supply. There was also a lack of formal forward transactions. The shorts in the market (June-August) were at most willing to pay 20 yuan, while the longs needed 21.5 yuan, but there were no opponents. 2,597 strips remained for this month, and 2,989 strips for July.</p>
<p>There were not many transactions in the market, and each firm lacked large-scale entries and exits. According to statistics, Ruixing, Hongli, Richang, Yuanchun, Yuanmao, Yong, Shenkang, Yuanmao, Zhengchang, etc. were on the buying side. Yifeng Yongdai and Yuanxing Yong sold a total of 420 strips in the *mao pan* (毛盤, raw gold market). Shunli, Wanxing, Bingxing, Chun Yuan, Yongtian, Yongtongyi, Yuanheng, etc. were on the selling side. Yuanmao, Yong Zhaofeng, Chang Hengyu, and Fuyu, etc. entered first and then exited. The Dalian bank Shunli squeezed out 84 strips in the morning market, and Wanxing also squeezed out 210 strips. In the afternoon market, both firms squeezed out dozens of strips each. Guangdong bank Hengxing had very few transactions, entering and exiting only dozens of strips in the morning market. They came to sell dozens of strips in the early afternoon market, and also came to supply after the close, selling about a hundred strips. There were a total of 21,483 chips for August.</p>
<h3>Stable and Quiet Foreign Exchange Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market was relatively sluggish, and the outlook was even quieter. At the start of the morning, overseas silver markets in both the UK and the US fell, so the exchange rates for British and American currencies rose slightly, while the US-UK rate remained unchanged. The forward price of silver for July rose by one point, then gradually decreased by more than one point. However, the prices of both American cotton and American wheat rose, coupled with a private telegraph reversing to increase by 0.0625, making it difficult for the opening to tighten. The recent selling price for British exchange was one shilling and three pence, and for American exchange, it was twenty-six yuan and three seven five, both equal to last Saturday. After opening, it presented a fluctuating pattern, with no special changes. The HSBC listed price for British exchange was flat, while American exchange shrank by 0.125. The noon close was unremarkable, and the aftermarket was even more sluggish, with few transactions. After entering, it became silent. Banks' appetites remained blocked, with a potential hardening. The initial telegram from Bombay reported a rise of 2.21 annas, followed by another report of 1.1 annas, with little impact. The gold industry remained on the buying side. By the close, the recent selling prices were one shilling and three pence for British exchange and twenty-six yuan and three seven five for American exchange, showing no gain or loss compared to the previous close. In the banking sector, HSBC, Mercantile Bank, and Banque Belge were on the selling side, while the Chinese banks and Dalian banks were on the buying side, totaling about 300,000, because the transactions were sparse. The day's transactions are recorded below: British exchange opened in the morning with a recent selling price of one shilling and three pence. Transactions were scarce, with only Hollands selling to Banque Belge 0.0625 for June. The noon close had a recent selling price of one shilling and three pence (or 0.0625). There were still few transactions in the aftermarket, with only the Bank of England reported to have sold to the Orient 0.125 for September. The closing selling prices were one shilling and three pence for June, 0.0625 for July and August, and 0.125 for September and October, with buying prices increased by 0.0625.</p>
<p>American exchange opened in the morning with a recent selling price of twenty-six yuan and three seven five. Banque Belge first blocked twenty-seven yuan for October and grabbed 8.875 for September. Shanghai offered 8.8125 for the same month. Hollands ate 9.9375 for October. P&amp;O blocked 9.75 for September. The American Bank sold 6.375 for June to Citibank. Banque Belge offered 8.5625 for August. P&amp;O offered 9.9375 for October. Yokohama Specie Bank sold 6.4375 for July to Banque Belge. Banque Belge blocked 9.9375 for October. Sino-Economic offered 8.625 for August to Shanghai. Banque Belge blocked 8.8125 for September and Mercantile offered 8.625 for August. The noon close had a recent selling price of twenty-six yuan and three seven five. In the afternoon, Mercantile came out to offer 9.75 for September. Banque Belge continuously blocked 8.5625 for August and 9.9375 for October. HSBC blocked 9.75 for September and 9.9375 for October. Yokohama Specie Bank sold 9.9375 for October to Mitsui. The closing selling prices were twenty-six yuan and three seven five for June, 6.4375 for July, 8.5625 for August, 9.75 for September, and 9.9375 for October, with buying prices increased by 0.0625 and 0.125.</p>
<h3>Great Northern Telegraph Shares Rise 0.125</h3>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from London on the 26th reported that Great Northern Telegraph shares rose by 0.125 for both near and far positions, with the near position at 18 pence 0.5625 and the far position at 18 pence 0.6875. The British-American exchange rate opened at four yuan, two jiao, and three and a half fen.</p>
<h3>Interbank Loan Market Shows Little Activity</h3>
<p>丨Large sums of money flow in and out as the mid-year settlement approaches丨</p>
<p>Yesterday's interbank lending market appeared superficially busy, mainly because various required funds for the approaching mid-year settlement were being organized and finalized. As a result, there was a busy appearance in terms of inflows and outflows. However, in reality, due to sluggish commerce and stagnant transactions, there was little clear activity. The market interest rates for interbank loans remained unchanged, with both morning and noon rates at seven percent, slightly better than the previous day by two percent, while the clearing rate remained unchanged without any added interest. The trading volume for interbank loan transactions was over 5.2 million in the morning and noon transfers, over 1.2 million for new transactions, over 600,000 for noon transactions, and over 300,000 in the Small General Association's transactions. The inflow and outflow of banknotes totaled about 2 million, including withdrawals and issuances. Loan transactions collateralized by silver dollars were over 1.9 million, with 150,000 from customer sources, which was interrupted halfway. Bank collections and remittances included 2.2 to 2.3 million in draft remittances from foreign firms, over 3.1 million in silver dollars, over 3 million in settlement remittances of silver dollars, over 2.4 to 2.5 million in special fund remittances of silver, and over 4.4 to 4.5 million in remittances of various merchandise exchange collateral and miscellaneous funds, over 4.5 million in silver dollars. Silver released from warehouses was 400,000, and silver dollars were 800,000. Chinese banks' remittances of draft remittances were 3.6 to 3.7 million, and remittances of various merchandise exchange taxes and miscellaneous collateral were over 6 million. Special fund remittances were over 3.7 million, and settlement remittances were over 3.7 million. Silver released from warehouses was 500,000. Japanese banks' silver deposited into warehouses was 500,000, and silver dollars were 600,000. Money shops' remittances of public foreign exchange notes were over 42.2 million, and clearing rate remittances were over 9.5 million. Remittances from various sources were over 800,000, and cash received was 600,000 to 700,000. Furthermore, the total amount exchanged at the local clearing house on the 6th was 5,191,949.68 silver yuan, including 2,957,237.99 silver yuan and 2,234,711.69 silver yuan in exchange remittances.</p>
<h3>Subsidiary Currency Remains Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Jiangnan small silver coins were unchanged from the previous day, with both morning and noon markets at 848 yuan, and very few transactions, with only six. The morning market had 7,500 jiao, and the noon market had 4,000 jiao. Guangdong small silver coins were at 772.4 yuan in the morning market and 772.5 yuan in the noon market, resulting in the same market situation as the previous day. The transaction volume was 45,000 jiao in the morning market and 40,000 jiao in the noon market. However, copper coins have been quiet recently after several days of active trading, so the market price has not fluctuated and remains at 317,500 wen, with a transaction volume of 39,670 strings of cash.</p>
<p>Securities</p>
<h3>Bond Market Shows Mixed Results</h3>
<p>The Squeeze on this month is easing</p>
<p>Only July futures were traded today</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, since it was the last day for June futures trading, both long and short parties who still had to square their positions had to try to get out on this day. Initially, due to the unfavorable environment and the still turbulent situation in North China, short positions surged, and long positions also emerged. The prices of each stock fell sharply by two to three jiao to six to seven jiao in the first round. In the second round, short sellers took advantage of the small price to cover their positions, so the price rose again by five to six jiao, still following the old pattern of mutual squeezing between long and short parties. The afternoon trend was slightly chaotic. The number of June transactions was already scarce, with the opening price slightly higher by one to two jiao. At the closing, only the disarmament bonds saw the most violent squeeze on the long side, with the price falling sharply by six to seven jiao for this month, while rising by one jiao for the next month, clearly showing the long positions rolling over. The other stocks saw mixed gains and losses, with a difference of about two to three jiao. As a result, the market prices were uneven, with a difference of only two to three jiao. The squeeze on positions for this month was relatively mild, because the market price was too high, and most of those with goods available for delivery were unwilling to buy them back. The future may either ease back or rise again before easing back. The total transaction volume was 13,916,000 yuan, including 1,000 yuan in spot goods. The futures contracts were dominated by consolidated salt tax bonds at 5,085,000 yuan, disarmament bonds at 1,870,000 yuan, 19 customs bonds at 1,880,000 yuan, 20 customs bonds at 2,290,000 yuan, and 96 bonds at 1,230,000 yuan. The rest ranged from tens of thousands to three to four hundred thousand yuan.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Shows Minimal Fluctuations</h3>
<p>According to a report from Sin Feng &amp; Co., on Saturday (the 24th), the New York stock market was in a stalemate, with minimal fluctuations among the major stocks. At the close, due to favorable news for long positions in the automotive industry and positive railway freight reports, short sellers were unwilling to take risks and began to cover their positions, causing the market to turn bullish. Railway freight for the week ending June 17 totaled 58,931 cars, an increase of 23,385 cars from the previous week and an increase of 13.4 percent from the same period last year. Half-day trading volume reached 6,169,600 shares. Overall, the current situation in the stock market remains good, as the US government's intention to continue raising prices is very clear. Based on this, the implementation of industrial management and public construction is promising.

<h3>Gentle Buying Trend in the Yarn and Cotton Market</h3>
<p>The yarn market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon, with a slightly stable trend. After a long period of decline, some profit-takers closed their positions, and long positions were slightly active. At the same time, spot yarn sales showed a slight increase, and sentiment improved. However, large sellers still had no intention of resisting short positions, so the pressure remained heavy.</p>
<h3>Active Yarn Market</h3>
<p>At the opening of the Shanghai Yarn Exchange market, there were rumors that American cotton prices would continue to rise, sentiment was good, and retail investors covered their positions, causing prices to rise by 1.2, 3, and 5 jiao for each month. The afternoon opening was still tight, with prices rising by 5 and 6 jiao for each month. By the second and third rounds, prices suddenly fell. Some said that British factories were opening cotton yarn with 3,000 bales, and that the price of yarn from a certain country had fallen, causing great fatigue in sentiment. Prices for each month fell by 5 and 8 jiao to 1 yuan compared to the previous market. The total transaction volume for the day was 57,500 bales. It was found that Daching sold 1,150 bales, Renfeng sold 1,300 bales, Yichang sold 1,100 bales, Tonghe sold 1,750 bales, and Dafeng sold 1,050 bales.

<p>Guangdong 355 Shantou 80 Fellow Traders 295</p>
<p>Nanjing 5 Wuhu 10 Xiamen 5</p>
<p>The cotton market initially rose and then fell, with a tight situation. The rumor that American cotton would destroy a quarter of its cotton fields led speculators to tend to buy, and Chen Hua 7 had a squeeze, which further boosted the market.</p>

<h3>Bombay Cotton Industry Weekly Report</h3>
<p>Last week, due to flat international markets and selling by Japanese traders, market prices were weak, and the price difference with American cotton widened. As a result of boycotts, about 250,000 bales of contracts were canceled in accordance with Japanese prohibitions. Since the exit of the Bai Luoxi cotton, the only major consumer, the local market has been very dull. Spot demand is low, with only slight shipments to China and Europe.

<h3>Coarse Japonica Rice Gradually Decreases in Price</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, over 40 sources arrived. Spot and wholesale trading were slightly better, but sentiment was difficult to maintain. Prices for downstream markets, such as Chang Bang, Su Tong Bang, and Nan Gang, for coarse japonica and Du Yang pointed rice gradually decreased by a few jiao. The thin rice from Qingjiao, Songjiang, and Liantang was purchased by the Northern and Southern Qingdao and Tangshan Bangs and the Southern Fuzhou Bangs, totaling 1,500 to 1,600 packages. The vendors tightened their prices, and the prices remained stable. The Bian Yuan market was still weak.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 17 to 18 boats arrived from various routes downriver. The daily japonica rice sales market was very quiet, causing prices to decrease by a small measure. There was a continuous arrival of thin japonica rice, but sales remained sluggish, and prices decreased by 1 jiao. Early rice also decreased by nearly 1 jiao. There was not much arrival of Yang Jian rice, but sales were still good. The market was generally stable with some fatigue in the middle and lower ranges. Du Jian and Ke Jian rice also showed signs of fatigue. Bian Yuan rice also weakened by several fen.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Merchant Tries Hunan Red Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign merchant indica rice market was active, and the appetite of the Fuzhou Bang was slightly more active. In addition to the 900 packages of Jiangbei machine-milled indica rice offered in the market, they also purchased 400 packages of Saigon Zhongguan rice from the No. 1 Xigong rice. The Tianjin Bang, which had not inquired about foreign rice for a long time, tried 303 packages of Hunan machine-milled red rice yesterday. The Wen Tai market's appetite was not strong, and they only purchased 200 packages of Wuxi machine-milled rice. The street market offered 100 packages of Saigon No. 1 old rice at a price of 8.25 yuan, while Zhongguan Saigon only cost 8.05 yuan. Hunan machine-milled red rice cost 8.38 yuan, Jiangbei indica rice cost 7 yuan, and Wuxi machine-milled rice cost 7.2 yuan. The arrival and inventory of Hunan machine-milled red rice were low. Because the Northern Bang made inquiries, it was slightly more expensive by 7 to 8 fen. The rest were average.</p>
<h3>Wheat Flour Exchange is Active and Prices are Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat flour market in the morning, the prices for each month were initially stable and then tightened. The quoted price for foreign wheat rose again by 5 jiao to 7 to 8 jiao. Initially, because the buying interest was not smooth, and the weather was good, people were inevitably confused. After entering, because outside buyers started to take action, and because of foreign price cuts, there was a trend of increasing, so people were very stable and entered a good state. When the market opened in the afternoon, people saw another leap. The sharp rise in Shanghai Wheat Exchange's wheat in the morning seemed to indicate that the future had a turning point, so the opening price was good, rising by another 1 fen compared to the morning. The transaction was also exceptionally prosperous. Subsequently, because large factories all had offloading, and the volume was huge, there was a pullback. However, after the fifth round, because buyers poured in again, the market atmosphere recovered. Looking at the previous trends, wheat flour sales were strong. We should be optimistic, otherwise, if the factory throws continue, although it is free from still subject to high pressure. As a result, this month's price was better than before by 1 fen and 7.5 li, July's price rose by 2 fen and 7.75 li, August's price rose by 2 fen and 2.5 li, September's price rose by 2 fen and 7.5 li, October's price rose by 3 fen, and November's price rose by 2 fen.</p>
<h3>Futures Wheat Rises Sharply by 8 to 9 Fen</h3>
<p>39,000 Packages of Spot Goods are Sold</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the futures wheat market, each month saw a sharp rise after the opening in the morning. The quoted price of foreign wheat rose again by 5, 7, and 8 jiao, and there were discussions to reduce production of wheat abroad. The momentum was maintained, and sentiment was naturally good. In addition, with the sunny weather since the start, although the arrival of goods was very prosperous, the producing areas were unwilling to sell at low prices. Wuxi high wheat was priced at 4.25 yuan, and factories had already made inquiries. In Jiangbei, the grain merchants raised prices and were unwilling to lower them, so sentiment was greatly boosted, and prices rose step by step after opening. The covering of short positions was also very smooth, rising by 6 to 7 fen compared to the previous week. In the afternoon, the trading was still smooth, but the increase was not much, because the covering of short positions was slightly reduced, and buyers were not very anxious. As a result, July and August rose by 8 fen, September rose by 9 fen, October rose by 7 fen, and November rose by 5 fen. The spot wheat market showed a high, flat, medium, and lower slight increase. The factory only bought high-quality goods at 7 jiao and a half, and did not accept anything beyond that, so only the middle and lower quality increased by 3 to 5 fen. However, the arrival of goods and spot deliveries were very smooth. Gaoyou, Taizhou, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, and Heqiao wheat opened at 3.75 yuan, Hushu, Wuhu, Caishi, and Guazhou wheat opened at 3.70 yuan, Yangzhou wheat opened at 3.75 yuan, next was 7 jiao, Pukou wheat opened at 3.72 yuan, next was 6 jiao 8 fen, and Hezhou wheat opened at 3.70 yuan, next was jiao half, Danyang wheat opened at 3.55 yuan, Nanjing wheat opened at 3.68 yuan, Qishuyan wheat opened at 3.67 yuan, Kunshan wheat opened at 3.67 yuan, next was 5 jiao 8 fen, Shuangfeng wheat opened at 3.65 yuan, next was 5 jiao half, and Wuhe special high wheat opened at 3.95 yuan.

<h3>Fresh Rapeseed and Broad Beans are Completely Gone</h3>
<p>This year's new rapeseed can be said to have disappeared from Shanghai. The market is active, but there are no goods. In short, all the merchants are gathering in the producing areas to purchase, so the new rapeseed trading in the Shanghai market seems to have come to an end. Broad bean trading is also different from previous years, and the arrived goods are being sold cheaply by buyers. Currently, the only destinations are Shantou and Xiamen foreign firms, and the number is very small. Fortunately, there are not many sources, and the market is still trending towards stability. Yesterday, 300 packages of Chongming broad beans were sold in the market at a price of 3 yuan, and 410 packages of Jiading broad beans were sold at a price of 4.4 yuan.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea, New Dry Cocoons Sell Quickly for a Good Price</p>
<h3>Tin and New Cocoons are Popular and Profitable</h3>
<p>The selling price of fresh cocoons in Wuxi is not high. Some farmers entrust their cocoons to local cocoon shops for drying, so each manufacturer now sends personnel to the countryside to weigh and collect dry cocoons from each silkworm farmer. The price is still popular and profitable. The price of high-quality foreign-bred cocoons is 180 yuan.</p>
<h3>Lu Spring Cocoons Have a Bumper Harvest</h3>
<p>The new cocoons in Zhoucun and Linqu counties in Shandong Province have a bumper harvest. Linqu produced more than 6 million catties of fresh cocoons, and Zhoucun also produced 7 to 800,000 catties.</p>
<h3>Jili Raw Silk is Being Reeled</h3>
<p>Each mechanized household in Nanxun is now reeling new silk. According to silk merchants in Shanghai, the cost of this year's Jili is not cheap. Each package costs nearly 800 yuan.</p>

<p>The market is mutually exclusive. Yesterday, 60 packages of Shanghai white factory silk, 30 packages of Lu yellow factory silk, 10 packages of gray silk, and 11 packages of white dry silk were traded. Most of the transactions were spot deliveries, and the price was firm.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the foreign firm tea market in Shanghai, the English firms Jardine and Jin Long and other firms were still actively purchasing high-quality Qimen black tea. The total transaction volume for the city was over 1,100 boxes, and the selling price was unchanged from before. The green tea market was even more stable. Green teas such as Tunxi, Shexian, and Suian's Zhen Mei, Zhen Mei, and Xia Mu green teas were still sold as soon as they arrived. Ping Shui merchants were also very popular. The total transaction volume of green tea was over 2,300 boxes. The selling price of needle eyebrows from the upper and middle grades was firmly higher by 2 to 3 yuan. The rest were trending towards stability. Gongxi's sales to India have decreased slightly in recent days, and the tea price has also fallen by 4 to 5 yuan to as much as 7 to 8 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's trend was quite tight due to the continued rise in customs gold. The guild's closing price for 24 coarse sugar white ordinary goods rose to 20.005 yuan, up from the previous day by 1 jiao to 7 fen. No. 20 medium sugar white was 19.3 yuan, and No. 89 Dutch red KNG mark was 16.1 yuan, each rising by 5 fen. Factory prices included Zhenji's offering of No. 1 soft white at 19.5 yuan, and Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 were refunded as is, up by 1 jiao from before. Zhonghua soft white No. 1 was 19.4 yuan, No. 2 was 19.2 yuan, and No. 3 was 19 yuan.

Also, Ban Nan Qing was 12.3 yuan, up by approximately 3 jiao from before. However, the market still lacks inventory, and further rises are expected.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Xiamen Soft Cakes Slightly Rise in Storefront Prices</h3>
<p>Xiamen soft cakes had previously been priced normally, and the storefronts had reached around 18 liang, which was difficult to reconcile with the land price, and had not arrived for a long time. Now, the Shanghai market is slightly more active, and the price has also risen. Yesterday, 20 pieces had arrived and were immediately offered at a price of 26.5 yuan, up by approximately 1 yuan from before.</p>

<p>Talks</p>
<h3>On Sleep</h3>
<p>— I</p>
<p>Eating and then sleeping, sleeping and then eating, doing nothing all day long, such a person is probably not very promising, and will inevitably be scolded as a waste. However, people always need to sleep. Officials need to sleep, and ordinary people also need to sleep. The wealthy need to sleep, and the penniless must sleep. The only difference is that different types of people have different ways of sleeping.</p>
<p>The sleep of ordinary people is mostly very simple. Getting up early in the morning and working until night, all for the sake of food and clothing, including sleep: of course, they are very tired, and as soon as they lie down, they feel very comfortable. Even a pine board stool is a very good bed. However, these people are still considered to have a family fortune with a board stool destined in their lives. A board stool is also worth one or two big silver dollars, and earning it is not easy. So compared to the bachelors who don't even have a board stool, it is several times better.</p>
<p>Aren't there many people who sleep on cement overnight? Aren't there many people who nap by the side of remote roads, using their packages as pillows? Although most of them are homeless people, there are many "tired to death" and "elite" people sleeping on spring beds who admire their free-spirited spirit. Sleeping boldly on the road, not at all restricted by etiquette, is something that noble people cannot do. Moreover, the cool breeze on the road can indeed replace the electric fan. Although dust and wind fill their nasal passages, fortunately, they rarely eat Beauty Brand ice cream on the road, so they don't have to worry about eating dust and affecting their health. Many people can't get a good night's sleep, and there are many people who sleep too much and get back pain. Many people can't sleep at night, and there are many people who want to sleep at night but prefer to sleep during the day. People who can't get sleep and don't get enough sleep are, of course, generally rough people who live hand to mouth. Sleeping a little longer means going hungry for a day. But the upper class, who sleep until their backs hurt or sleep during the day, also have their reasons for living. For example, in this hot summer, even if the house is equipped with air conditioning pipes, it still feels strangely hot, and even ice cream has to be used as food. What else is good to do?</p>
<p>Besides sleeping, there is no better way to kill time. As for waiting for the evening to be cooler, and gliding through the dream world in vain, it would be a pity. So, in order to cherish it, one must have as much fun as possible at night. In this way, replenishing sleep during the day is also a matter of course. As for many people who can't sleep because they are too lucky at cards, or because they have smoked too much opium and are too excited, insomnia is inevitable. It is said that this is also a serious problem, and one must run to Shanghai to ask a top doctor for treatment, and even go abroad for long-term recuperation. From this, it can be seen that the matter of sleep is also very troublesome.</p>
<h3>Profit</h3>
<p>— Sixty-one</p>
<p>"The world bustles with activity, all for profit; the world scurries about, all for profit." This is truly an unchanging principle throughout the ages, the same both at home and abroad. Originally, "a thousand li to become an official is only for wealth."</p>
<p>But look at those friends who, with guns in hand, are accustomed to firing inward. If they were not for this, would they not be comfortably lying on spring beds, smoking opium, and embracing beautiful concubines? Why would they forsake such a comfortable life to mobilize troops and engage in the act of killing? Even a simpleton like myself cannot escape this. Therefore, filled with hopeful expectations, I traveled thousands of miles to this glamorous place to help others. Otherwise, in my old home in the countryside, although I lived in a thatched hut, slept on a straw bed, ate coarse grain and vegetable soup, and wore rough cloth clothes, I wouldn't necessarily have grown to this size. I also hope that a poor boy can transform into a high-ranking official and show off in my hometown. But it's embarrassing to say that after years of being someone else's beast of burden, a poor boy remains a poor boy. I fear that in a few more years, my temples will be gray, and the time for me to become a decrepit, senile old man nearing my coffin is not far off. By the time I have achieved this, what good will it do? Conversely, if I have already become a wealthy elder now, then I would only tear down the thatched hut in the countryside and build a Western-style house in this paradise. I would change my straw bed to a sofa bed, and my coarse rice and vegetable soup to French cuisine and a Ford suit. But in that instant of the journey, the extravagant Huangliang dream is very easy to end. When the last second of breath ceases, it's just a stiff, tightly bound object packed into a wooden box. What difference is there from the former poor boy? Therefore, many wealthy and powerful figures in the country should be able to see through this point. At the end of the year, they should openly state on the donation list that they will donate half of their profits of 300,000 or 100,000 to charitable organizations. Then, these longevity banks will surely be deserted. The pawnshops run by the red-turbaned Indians and the "leather ball money" lent by the old rascals will also truly and finally rest in peace. (However, they will be rewarded).</p>
<h3>Horn Dumplings</h3>
<p>— Xian</p>
<p>The sky is gloomy, like a sick old man. The room is even more dim. I was bored and lying on the bed, flipping through a newly published magazine. A burst of hurried footsteps stopped at my door. The landlady's daughter poked half her face in. Seeing that I was not asleep, she jumped in like a little bird. She was holding a string of horn dumplings in her hand, which she placed beside my desk before standing there with a smile. She always looked like that, liking to stand and watch me write and read. She is called A Cui. That's what her mother called her. She is fourteen years old. According to her, the landlady is not her biological mother; she was abducted, but the landlady still loves her. I threw my book aside, stood up, and walked to the desk. "A Cui, where did you get the horn dumplings?" I asked her.</p>
<p>"Mom sent them for you to eat. She said you have to eat horn dumplings for the Dragon Boat Festival." Women are superstitious. She always gets up early on the first and fifteenth of each month to burn incense and kowtow, so they consider the following sentence unlucky. She twisted her body, smiled, and jumped out.</p>
<p>"A Cui, thank your mother," I said subconsciously. Dragon Boat Festival. I had calculated its arrival ten days ago, but I thought it wouldn't be so fast. It should be two or three days later. I looked up. Under the 28th on the calendar, I had indeed marked the Dragon Boat Festival with a red pen myself. Originally, things like the Dragon Boat Festival had nothing to do with me. I just tore off a set of calendars and replaced it with a new one. I never calculated that today is New Year's Day, and what tomorrow is. I sell my brain and eat my own food. Calculating often leads to major disappointments for me. But this time, I had been calculating the Dragon Boat Festival for ten days.</p>
<p>Half a month ago, my old friend came to my small building. He said, "I need thirty yuan for the Dragon Boat Festival. Can you try to find a way?"</p>
<p>He is the same as me, but he sells his labor. He came to discuss it with this poor friend of mine, which shows that he has nowhere else to turn. I agreed rashly at the time.</p>
<p>This amount, which is neither big nor small, can be spent on a night of dancing in the eyes of those who take cars, but poor people sell their bodies, and I don't know if they can get such a price in a month.</p>
<p>I rushed around for a few days and barely managed to scrape together the amount he needed. I wrote him a letter telling him that I would deliver it to his house in the morning of the Dragon Boat Festival because I had to get some of the money today.</p>
<p>After hearing A Cui's words, I hurriedly put on my clothes. I wondered how anxiously my old friend was waiting. When I walked into the living room, the landlady smiled and asked me if I had eaten the dumplings. I thanked her and ran out as if flying.</p>
<p>"There are groups of people who dream of 'If you don't eat dumplings on the Dragon Boat Festival, no one will send you off when you're old,' and there are groups of people who are calculating how to survive their difficulties. Is humanity really so unequal?" I thought in the rickshaw, "There are probably many people who can't even get to the point of tearing off a set of calendars and replacing it with a new one!"</p>
<h3>Hero</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Our heroes are purple-faced, fast-legged, and often tall guys who wear sailor hats halfway up their heads. They have big fists, thick arms, and the strength of a young wild ox. Besides winning trophies at sports meets and taking shortcuts in classrooms, they often do things like "drawing their swords to help when they see injustice on the road." Although they sometimes can't help but beat rickshaw pullers and kick peddlers, it's mostly because they deserve it.</p>
<p>This day, after lunch, everyone was chewing sugarcane, eating candy, and chatting in the table tennis room. "Little Fan" Chen crept in, and quietly said: "Isn't Miss Lu very flustered these days when she comes to school? Do you know why?"</p>
<p>While taking the gum that Little Cheng threw to him, he glanced triumphantly at everyone's faces, and then continued: "Someone is doing A, B, C, haha, something extremely evil."</p>
<p>"Outrageous, outrageous!" Everyone was a little indignant.</p>
<p>"Originally, such scandalous things must be punished, but..."</p>
<p>He chewed hard, smiled faintly,</p>
<p>"But, unfortunately, I don't have the strength."</p>
<p>The heroes just didn't say anything, and finally calmly asked, "Really?"</p>
<p>"Who would lie to you? They even dared to get physical. Miss Lu almost suffered at their hands the day before yesterday. I saw it with my own eyes."</p>
<p>"Okay, we'll see what happens tomorrow." So everyone continued to laugh and talk as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>I didn't have much of a chance to see "what happens," but watching other people "see what happens" is at least an interesting thing. So, after eating the next day, heroes and non-heroes alike ambushed themselves dozens of yards away from the school, of course, in small shops and fruit stalls, so as not to attract attention. It was a bit like the secret agents in the newspapers catching kidnappers, only without the disguise reported in the newspapers.</p>
<p>After a while, Miss Lu came, and sure enough, two men in suits and crooked hats were following her closely, muttering something.</p>
<p>The leader of the heroes got up, first said a few words to Miss Lu, and then turned to the two men.</p>
<p>"You pigs, are you blind?"</p>
<p>"Damn you, who are you? It's none of your business!" The two couldn't help but become angry out of embarrassment.</p>
<p>The hero jumped over and punched one of them in the face, making a crisp sound.</p>
<p>Then, everyone in ambush surrounded them, trapping the two poor wretches in the center. Fists slammed into their bodies, making a booming sound of flesh hitting flesh. But they were ultimately well-behaved. Seeing that they were outnumbered, they had to retreat, their faces turning red and then white, which was indeed an unusual color.</p>
<p>"Okay. Very good, we know you," they said, trying to put on a brave front.</p>
<p>The heroes were completely victorious. They sang a triumphant song and returned to the school gate in a grand manner.</p>
<p>"Refreshing!" Little Fan sighed. "Those blind bastards actually dared to insult women in front of us. It's a bargain that we didn't break their legs."</p>

<h3>The Chinese who are kept in the dark say: I'll just muddle along</h3>
<p>Shop Assistant Correspondence</p>
<h3>The danger of partnership business Editor Sir</h3>
<p>Every time I read the answers in your column, I admire them very much. I am a shop assistant who is learning the trade in this shop, thanks to my father's influence. Recently, a pressing problem has arisen. The situation is as follows: this shop was opened by my father's sole investment. Over ten years ago, my father established a company with others outside. My father only had one-tenth of the shares, and half a share. He also had a deposit of over 8,000 yuan in the company. The major shareholder was the manager, and my father did not offer any advice on the company's business. The company has now gone bankrupt, owing over 200,000 yuan. The creditors have filed lawsuits, wanting the shareholders to settle the matter. Some shareholders are unable to pay, and some are temporarily avoiding the situation. Only my father and this shop remain. It is found that my father's half share and deposit are within the bankruptcy. I dare to ask the gentleman to answer:</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>(1) Should my father be responsible for half of the company's debt, or should he be responsible for the entire debt?</p>
<p>(2) If my father is unable to bear the responsibility for half of the shares, is there a possibility that this shop will be sealed up?</p>
<p>(3) What method can be used to prevent this shop from being implicated?</p>
<p>The matter is urgent, and I hope that the gentleman will quickly give me a great lesson. Respectfully yours, Wang Boshou</p>
<p>Editor's note: In this matter, if it is handled completely according to the law, Wang Jun's father has a very heavy responsibility. The current law stipulates that all shareholders of a partnership must use all of their assets as collateral for the debts of the store; and the relationship between each shareholder is to bear joint and several liability. In other words, if the store loses 200,000 yuan, then the shareholder with one-twentieth of the shares, in addition to having to take out 10,000 yuan to redeem himself, must also be responsible for the remaining 190,000 yuan if the other shareholders are unable to pay. To put it more bluntly, if there is one shareholder among all the shareholders whose assets are sufficient to redeem himself, the creditors have the right to unilaterally demand payment from this one person; this is the danger of partnership business. Wang Jun's father, having already assumed this responsibility, should have paid attention to the situation in the store at ordinary times: Now that the other shareholders are mostly desperate, or have fled far away, how could there have been no news beforehand? He cannot help but admit that he was careless.</p>
<p>However, now that things have already happened, complaining about heaven and blaming others is useless; quickly think of a way. The reason why we</p>
<p>wanted to first explain the legal responsibilities in detail is nothing more than to hope that Wang Jun's father can understand his position and be willing to resolve the matter painfully. Now, someone else should come out to negotiate with the creditors, giving all of his assets to the creditors, except for the small amount necessary for future living. Seeing that things are in a stalemate, they will have no choice but to agree; this is because the bankruptcy law stipulates that bankruptcy applicants have the right to request that a living allowance be left at the discretion of the court! In addition, efforts should be made to investigate whether other shareholders have hidden assets or engaged in fraudulent activities. If so, on the other hand, the court may be asked to arrest them, or even issue an arrest warrant, so that they can bear the burden.</p>

<h3>Under the Traffic Light (11)</h3>
<p>— Xilin</p>
<p>The chief of staff walked out of the living room, and after a while, another one came out. He was the one who was assigned to help them. This person also had something of the chief of staff's demeanor. He spoke haltingly, and sometimes he would remain silent without saying a word. His first step was to go to the place where Zhou Zhang and others were gathering. On the way, Zhou Zhang seemed to have suffered endless grievances, and was thinking about how disappointed those eager students would be. After all, Li Shiqiao was more experienced. Along the way, he explained to the person who was sent the purity of their elements and the truthfulness of their patriotism, etc. But the special envoy denied any suspicion of the elements. He said that his task was only to conduct a corresponding investigation on the military organization. Shiqiao was ultimately overtired, and walking made him feel strangely greasy, so he instructed Zhou Shaoping a few words and ran home to prepare for another nap. As he was walking to the door with his head down, he was unexpectedly slapped on the shoulder by a hairy hand. He looked up and saw Li Halov. He always tried to evoke intimacy, but always aroused boredom. His words were also often very sudden, making people unable to figure them out for a while. For example, he said to Shiqiao now: 丨 using broken English interspersed with Chinese.</p>
<p>"In any case, the spirit of Araki is always admirable 丨 I hate the Japanese, but their spirit is good! Listen!" His head lifted, and a burst of cannon fire boomed. "This is the roar of mankind!" Then, with an unpleasant expression on one side of his face, thinking that it was a kind of comforting attitude towards Shiqiao, he lightly said, "Mr. Li, China must cheer up!" And went to the kitchen.</p>
<p>Shiqiao looked blankly at Li Halov's back, and sighed lazily: "This worshiper of skeletons!"</p>
<p>(8) Spicy coconut, tropical coconut!</p>
<p>"Changfa 丨 That Mr. Li in the pavilion is my cousin, he is just like one of our family, you know! If there is anything, call you to serve him well!"</p>
<p>"Yes" 丨 Changfa only uttered one word, his body slightly bent, although he had the respectful attitude that a servant should have towards his master, he did not have any timid expression. His rough black skin showed that he came from a factory worker's background, not the kind of light-duty waiter or cook. He was a worker in Yang Jiefu's yarn factory. This time, the factory stopped work due to the war, and he was temporarily called to help the third concubine cook. He was very loyal to Jiefu in the factory and was a very capable subordinate. He could also receive some subsidies every month.</p>
<p>"Go, go and cook dinner. The master won't be back. Mr. Li is eating here. Make more dishes for drinking, you know?" The third concubine 丨 has always been very dignified when she directs her servants. She could make even the calmest Changfa have to hurry out.</p>
<p>Changfa is a versatile person. He can prepare one or two very expensive banquets. Now he is starting to skillfully arrange various vegetables, and the kitchen counter is neatly arranged. A Zhen, thinking that she was an old timer in front of the third concubine, couldn't help but said to him: "</p>

<h3>Jenny Gaynor's New Life After Divorce</h3>
<p>— Cun</p>
<p>Turn grief into strength and seek new sources of joy</p>
<p>Where to put Charles Farrell</p>
<p>After Jenny Gaynor divorced Littelbeck, she regained her freedom and could freely seek romance. So, what are her plans for this free new life! Will she marry again! Or will she not want to be deceived by marriage again because of the suffering of her previous marriage! What is her plan?</p>
<p>Although Jenny understands that her previous marriage was a mistake, she does not regret this mistake. She will never be deceived by marriage because of the pain, so she said: "Sorrow and happiness are balanced in life. If one is missing, it cannot satisfy anyone's desires. Sorrow makes us worship happiness."</p>
<p>She said: "I am thinking of finding a new marriage, but not in the short term, because I always have to be with Mom for a few more years: And lately, the work on the movies and the equipment of the house will take at least a few months."</p>
<p>Her new home is rented. Although it is not as magnificent as that of other stars, it is exquisite and elegant, with a garden, trees, pavilions, ponds, and lawns, and the layout is appropriate. The equipment and furniture in the house are all bought from what she likes the most, and of course there is no limit to the size of the waste. Her time after the divorce can be said to be very happy. However, for a brilliant star like her, solving the marriage problem is a very easy thing, and it can also be said to be a very hesitant thing. It is said that there are more than two dozen of the most attractive young single men in Hollywood who are willing to accept her marriage, regardless of donating everything in their world, as long as she is willing to sacrifice the romance that occurs with others. Not only do they have this desire, but they are also working hard to carry it out. It is said that Louis Aries and Jimmy ten are the most promising. Jenny has a good relationship with these two people, and she is happy to associate with them in dance halls and banquets. I wonder who will win in the future?</p>
<p>Film Commentary</p>
<h3>Review of "Night Not to Return"</h3>
<p>— Yan Nan</p>
<p>As I walked out of the New Light Theater, I heard the departing audience discussing amongst themselves: "’Night Not to Return’ is really good," "That Zheng Zizhen is really interesting," and similar comments. Indeed, apart from the story itself, all aspects of the performance were very satisfying. I might as well agree with the majority and say, "The film itself is good!"</p>
<p>The story couldn't be simpler: a young man falls in love with a female nurse. Because they want to have some intimate talks, he spends "one night away from home" (supposedly because the gate was closed, so the young man couldn't return). The young man's mother becomes anxious because of the "night not to return," and immediately forces her son to marry. Unexpectedly, she follows the young couple every step of the way, causing them great embarrassment. The female nurse has no choice but to leave without saying goodbye, and the young man chases after her to spend their honeymoon.</p>
<p>This mother is truly like an old-fashioned lady from the 18th century. Later, after her son and daughter-in-law leave, how lonely and sad this old woman is!</p>
<p>However, this film is a complete farce, without any tragic overtones. Therefore, everything internal is released, and the film only expresses superficial laughter.</p>
<p>Therefore, a slapstick comedy is just that: a slapstick comedy.</p>
<p>The performances are more worthy of discussion. Zasu Pitts is a famous female Chaplin. In this film, she is undoubtedly the most successful, with a kind and gentle demeanor, very fitting for the role of a nurse. In the middle section, when bothered by the old woman, her distressed expression and strange behavior reveal her uneasy mood, which can be said to be just right. She has a naturally "cat-crying" face. Casting her as this pitiful creature who suffers in silence and has no way to vent is truly wonderful. The male lead, Slim Summerville, is equally matched with Zasu, appearing silly and simple. In the end, he surprisingly wins the love of his wife, proving the saying "fools have fortune." His simple performance is truly hilarious. However, while he knows how to pursue a woman, he doesn't express any "love," seemingly not as good as Zasu, who can act like a little bird clinging to her lover. Slim Summerville is not a good match. Both of them can represent a certain type of person in society. There are many parts that make people burst into laughter, but there are also many parts that make people feel both amused and helpless. Their collaboration, with the mother in front, unable to speak and looking at each other, is the best scene. Laura Hope Crews, as the old lady, achieves excellent results, constantly nagging, representing the stubbornness of a person controlling their son, somewhat reminiscent of Marie Dressler's humor, but with more humor than depth. In addition, the three children are good. Their unexpected addition adds interest and makes the film particularly rich, preventing it from being monotonous. One can only say that the director's skills are good, and the other areas directed are also commendable. There is nothing particularly outstanding. The supporting roles are all decent.</p>
<p>Technically, some may find it fresh and unique, but it is mostly due to the division of scenes, which can be considered clever. Therefore, the structure is continuous, and the film's production shows a slight rise, but the photography, lighting, and set design are all unremarkable.</p>
<p>There is one more point that should be discussed. When the two leads go to Chinatown to play, there is a sudden disconnect in the middle. Indeed, the middle part was cut by the central authorities. I know that what was removed had many Chinese people, each wearing a watermelon-rind hat, wearing double-strap shoes, and many bare-chested, like Shandong street performers. This is indeed insulting to the Chinese people, so it was cut. But I believe that if it truly exists, it should be fundamentally prohibited and warned. If it is only cut and then reattached when exported from China, then isn't this cut by the central authorities somewhat meaningless?</p>
<p>Ms. Xu Lai, known as the Eastern standard of beauty, in the new Mingxing Film Company production "Remnant Spring", also made her debut in the screen. Photographed by Li Zunyong.</p>
<h3>Twenty Thousand People Are Denied Entry Each Year</h3>
<p>According to a report from Mr. Dante, the personnel director of Paramount Pictures in the United States, approximately 20,000 people leave their hometowns each year to find work in Hollywood; however, after experiencing disappointment, they return to their hometowns. They come with great expectations but leave with sighs of disappointment. Now that unemployment is increasing, many unemployed people are pawning their belongings and traveling long distances to Hollywood, but there are already 17,000 extras there who get work for only one or two days a month and are crying out in misery. Therefore, these unemployed people, having lost everything, travel long distances again to try their luck elsewhere. It can be seen that the land of gold is not necessarily a paradise.</p>
<h3>Review of "Express Train No. 13"</h3>
<p>— Qi Ying</p>
<p>A film of 10,000 feet runs for two hours, and the story depicts an incident that occurs within just three hours.</p>
<p>To have edited such a short time into such a good script is indeed very rare in the film industry, isn't it?</p>
<p>The story is about the operation of a special train, where bandits plan to kidnap a wealthy man and sabotage the tracks. Fortunately, they are discovered, but the special train and another express train have to stop at a small station to wait for the track repairs to be completed. A young man on the express train gets off to wander around and meets a female bandit, falling into the bandits' trap and attacking the police on behalf of the bandits. However, soon after, he realizes the truth and immediately escapes back to the express train. At this time, the track has been repaired, and the special train and express train depart one after another, and the bandits are also captured.</p>
<p>The original name of this script, "Expressr3islate," seems to translate to "The Thirteenth Express Train is Delayed." The film is only about the story of the thirteenth express train arriving three hours late. It only mentions the number of times and does not use the word "No."</p>
<p>Someone told me that this is a true story brought to the screen, and I somewhat believe it because, in terms of the plot and theme, I feel it is the most boring of Ufa's productions, and I can't find any central meaning.</p>
<p>However, after the screening, I know that most people can be satisfied with it, feeling that it has many elements that are sketches of German social reality, clearly showing the seriousness of unemployment and the thorny situation that makes capitalists in Germany as unstable as in China, with the constant danger of being kidnapped and ransomed.</p>
<p>Secondly, the director's depiction of the general psychology of society is very thorough, using a beautiful woman as the center of the whole film, leading to the bandits' group and the young man falling for the honey trap without realizing it, all reflecting the magic of women.</p>
<p>The most successful aspect of the whole film is the director. From beginning to end, he uses a contrasting approach, revealing the cunning and hypocrisy of people in society in many small places.</p>
<p>In particular, the female bandit, who "speaks human language to humans and ghost language to ghosts," is very common in today's world. After the track is destroyed, the workers are anxious, the train immediately stops, the special train receives a huge shock, and in the second half, the police and bandits engage in a battle of wits. All of these are very tense.</p>
<p>Regarding the directing, techniques, etc., I am limited by space and cannot describe them in detail. Anyway, they have tried their best to please in all areas where they can develop, without letting go of even a sliver of opportunity. We can no longer easily find half a loophole. This is indeed the meticulousness of German filmmakers, and it does not seem to take much effort, all very natural. But when Chinese people watch this film, many German realities, customs, and everything else feel somewhat unfamiliar, of course, different from American films in every aspect.</p>
<p>Apart from the female bandit Charlotte Sosa, none of the performances were particularly successful. Her performance is very flexible, especially her watery eyes, which can very well represent a fierce and capable harlot. The male lead, Heing Konecke, did put in considerable effort, and in many beautiful night scenes, he can add a lot of stimulation, but his expressions are ordinary. In addition, I think the actors with a foreign style are all very capable of acting, but apart from German nationality, I really can't find any special strengths.</p>
<p>In order to change the audience's taste, another work with a different style, although not a major production, will ultimately be generally welcomed, and this film does have considerable merit in terms of skills.</p>
<h3>Movie Novel Song of Songs (3)</h3>
<p>— En Ping</p>
<p>That young man, pleased, earnestly looked at her, saying that she made a living by books and should express sympathy for art. Lily was moved by this sentence. The young man also said that he was an artist, and handed her a business card.</p>
<p>Lily smiled. She heard the doorbell ring, and her aunt came in with Blue on her arm. She quickly stuffed the business card into her pocket. The young man also quickly picked up a book, stealing glances at Lily. Her aunt suspiciously looked at the situation and stumbled into the back room. Seeing the old monster leave, the young man whispered to Lily, hoping she would come tonight, and left. After he left, Lily immediately felt how lonely the shop was. She touched the warm business card on her chest, and in her ears, she seemed to still hear the earnest voice saying, "Can you come tonight?" A bit of joy permeated her heart. The ice of loneliness deepened after all.</p>
<p>While Lily was working, she thought of Wahl, and she was wholeheartedly thinking of the sculpting room across the street. A week later, her steps followed her thoughts. One night, Lily took two books and deliberately dropped them heavily on her aunt's floor. Her aunt did not wake up. Lily grabbed a shawl, covered her head, and slipped out of the shop in a hurry.</p>
<p>When Wahl saw her come, he warmly welcomed her into the sculpting room. Lily said that she was being presumptuous by coming and that if her aunt found out, what would she do? After they laughed for a while, Wahl showed her the outline he had sculpted for her from memory. Wahl further asked her to take off her clothes, preparing to sculpt a large marble statue for her. Lily did not understand his meaning and hesitated to go. Wahl was a little annoyed, called out her name, and told her that he had no bad intentions, but that he wanted to sculpt a beautiful stone statue, and it would not be successful without her. Lily understood his sincerity and nodded.</p>
<p>Lily forgot herself, forgot the time, and even forgot the fatigue as she stood as a sculpture model for him. She watched him wield his knife and carve, feeling the same creative impulse, feeling that some important parts of herself were transmitted into the outline of the stone statue through his hands.</p>
