<p>九人委員會昨開圓滑會議意在延宕</p>
<p>我斷然反對國聯遷就日本進行調解</p>
<p>（日内瓦）九人起草委員會今晨雖曾集議、但僅對李頓十原則略加討論、並未着手起草建議、意在消磨光陰、坐待日本新提議提出後之發展、日本之新提議極盡技巧能事、十九國特委會已允於明日加以考慮、特委會對中日兩國待遇顯不公平、其縱容日本之結果、僅助日軍欺侮國聯耳、（八日中央社電）</p>
<p>日内瓦十九國委員會之起草委員會、今晨十時四十分在國聯秘書長室開會、但僅討論李頓報告第九章内十項建議之文字、仍未切實擬定草稿現料倘十九國委員會明晨開會、决定日本最近提議不足以移轉形勢後、則起草委員會或將於明日下午再行集議、擬定　國聯建議之草稿、據聞該委員會起草工作進行甚緩、其進步遠比預料者爲少、德委員方凱勒語人、若照目前進行情形、國聯報告書非至下星期中間不能草竣、西班牙代表蘇路泰今晨回瑪德里、其担任之起草委員職務、由瑪達利亞加接任、（八日國民電）</p>
<p>日内瓦九人小組會今晨集議兩小時有零、草報告書已有若干進步、十二時三刻休會、秘書長德魯蒙在今日集會時、宣佈接到日方新提議、但未提交小組會、因副本業已送至各國代表之寓所也、十九特委會定明晨集議、以便透澈討論日方提議、一般印象似以爲日方提議雖成尙須修改、但可爲諒解基礎、在此情勢之下、今晨討論之未有結局、自無足異、秘書處所提出之建議案起草計畫、今日大加修改、有數點未曾議定、九人小組會之某委員聲稱、至少尚須兩次會議、方可獲有同意云、今晨草稿係以李頓報告書十原則爲根據小組會各委員對於會議内客、極守機密、致引起種種猜測、今日所得之進步與報告書首先數段有關、至於建議案中發生困難之點、聞爲日本在滿特殊利益如鐵路等、應如何承認之形式、（八日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）今晨起草委員會散會後、當局鄭重聲稱、委員會進行圓滑會議時絶對和協、各委員此時確猶未曾草擬不承認［滿州國］、及國聯會員　不當與之合作建議、但此點旣經十九國委員會一致决定、料草擬時當不致生嚴重困難、（八日國民社電）</p>
<p>日内瓦聞日人新提議係規定日本接受十九國委員會所草理由說明書之條件、十九國委員會現將立刻開始研究、查明由說明書内最後一節、曾宣稱、維持［滿洲國一與恢復九一八前原狀、俱非滿意解决辦法、聞目下日本對於接受此種聲明、冀望委員員在於說明書内加入李頓報告中有利於日本之若干點、以爲交　故松岡曾聲稱、彼輩旣欲日本接受李頓報告、渠殊未見在調解基礎中、有不應列入李頓報告有利日本各點之理由、此乃絶對爲日人最後之努力云云、皮尼士與艾登旣接到松岡提議、遂立即密加商榷、至日本之堅持加入李頓報告内有利日本若干點、是否將足以消除其接受說明書内最後一節（即關於僞組織之聲明）之效力、則尙無所聞、據英代表團發言人稱、松岡建議須加以審愼研究、無論如何、十九國委員會或將感覺在完成其草擬國聯對於中日爭執建議以前、有加以考慮之必要、至日人提議内容、猶未完全發表、松岡在宣示其性質時、亦未肯明言、倘國聯依循日本途徑進行調停後、日本將敢何種步驟、有若干觀察時事者頗信一旦重開調解後、日本將再提一詳細提議、列入彼所願接受之滿洲新地位、惟質諸松岡則仍默不置答、（七日國民電）</p>

<p>待遇兩造殊欠公允</p>
<p>（南京）外交界息、十九國特委會雖已令九國委員會起草報告書之建議部份、但調解仍在進行、現由特魯蒙與日接洽請接受去年十二月十五日之草案、而删去美俄參加一節、對不承認僞組織一節、且可予保留、我方對此斷然反對、已由我代表團正式聲明不能同意、蓋進行調解必須向雙方同時進行、此一味遷就日本之行動、自爲我所難堪、再就調解本身而論、如不邀美俄參加、則力量單薄、保留不承認僞組織、則中日問題必長此遷延、故外交界認爲果欲主持正義維持和平、必須毅然起草報告書、不應遷就日本云云、（八日中央社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）中國代表團今晨以公文一件送交九人委員會内稱、［一九三三年二月四日國聯會秘書處所發表之公文中、有一宣言、謂國聯會秘書長曾於一月二十日通告中國代表團云、十九國委員會準備將决議草案及理由說明書酌予修正、俾與日本政府之願望相符合云云、此項宣言或與中國首席代表顏惠慶與十九國委員會主席是日相會晤一事有關、此事有應注意者、當日顏惠慶氏僅據通知、謂有人擬將理由說明書改爲主席宣言、並擬將邀請非會員國參加調解一節删去、顏氏並接獲通知、謂日本對於此項宣言、或將提出保留、又一九三三年一月二十一日秘書長所發表之公報、關於理由說明書亦僅謂［雙方當事國得自由提出保留］、厥後二月五日所發表之公報、乃明白指出［十九國委員會對於雙方當事國有意正式承認其提出保留之權利、］實爲前此所未聞、中國代表團及首席代表在一月二十日與十九國委員會主席及秘書長會晤時、并於是日所發表之宣言内、曾聲明對於一切修正足以使决議草案原文力量因而減削者、均所反對、並堅持［滿洲國］不繼續存在之原則、須在决議草案明白聲明、並由雙方當事國予以承認、以爲調解程序之根本原則、此外一月二十一日國聯會秘書處所發表之公文、曾明白指示十九國委員會關於調解程序之企圖已經失敗、當决定依照盟約第十五條第四欵即行草擬報告書、該公報又稱、盟約第十五條第三欵所規定之調解程序、惟大會有權將其結果、此際雙方當事國若有新建議提出、十九國委員會當然準備接受云云、（八日哈瓦期電）</p>

<h3 id="c57">制憲問題文 <a href="#c57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>立法院一月二十日會議通過設立憲法草案委員會。準備起草爲國家根本大法之憲法。孫科張知本諸氏且迭次發表關於制憲之意見。國人亦極爲注目。在二十世紀之今日。世界各國殆無一不已制定憲法。奉爲政治措施之航針獨有我國自清季以來立憲之聲即不絶於耳。然而眞正之憲法則終始未克制定。二十餘年來國是紛亂。法旣莫以服民。政尤莫由步上軌道。故今日制定憲法。使舉國人民皆得有所保障。使政治措施皆得有所依據。實爲當前至急之務。</p>
<p>不過。吾人認爲憲法爲國家之根本大法。亦即爲國家一切措施之主宰。故此種關係重大之工作。絶不容有半點草率與遷就。質言之。即眞正之憲法必眞能代表人民之利益。適合人民之要求。吾人茲請本貢獻蒭蕘之旨。爲憲法草案委員會諸君子一陳所見。</p>
<p>第一。吾人認爲政府於今日準備制憲之初。應先切實自問是否確有制憲之誠意。換言之。即是否確有實行民主政治之决心。如制憲而純爲具文。則曹吳時代之立憲運動。固已使吾人迄於今日猶。有寒心。殊不願此種虚僞之憲法。虚僞之憲政重見於吾人之眼前。此爲一先决問題。如不解决此一問題。則所謂制憲。適爲徒勞。</p>
<p>第二吾人認爲憲法之最高原則。應以人民之利益爲依歸。在此一最高原則之下。即應無個人之特殊利益。亦無某一集團之特殊利益。蓋所謂憲政即爲民主政治。民主政治最困難之問題之一。即爲個人利益與國民全體共同利益常無法調和。在此一矛盾之下憲法乃終成爲具文民主政治亦終流爲虚僞。目前歐美各國之所謂憲法與憲政。殆無一能超出此一範疇。亦即無一不流弊百出。故吾人認定惟眞正之人民意志。乃爲眞正之憲法。亦惟眞正之憲法。乃能眞實代表人民之利益。而不爲個人或少數人之護符或工。具今日而言制憲。如不能切實立於此一基礎之上。則就令憲法能得成功。人民亦終將末由蒙受其福利。</p>
<p>第三憲法之制定。一方面應適合國内社會上與經濟上之需要。及本國歷史習慣之趨向。另一方面亦應注意無背於時代之潮流。就憲法言。在今日之世界。顯然有兩種範疇。一爲歐美各民主國家之憲法。另一則爲蘇聯社會主義之新憲法。此兩種範疇。不　異其形式抑且異其實質。。而此兩種範疇。則又都適爲我國今日之藍本吾人於此則應審視時代潮流之趨向。絶不應纍守成規。與世界思潮之洪流相背馳。</p>
<p>凡此三者皆爲起草憲法之最重大之問題。吾人切盼憲法起草委員會諸君子於此數問題。都能明確體。認庶此次之制憲工作。不至終歸於流產。尤有進者。憲法之制定。不在於形式而重在實施。虚僞之憲法。則常徒爲具文。可由少數人壟斷操持亦可由少數人修改破壞。如今日德國之希忒勒。爲實現其獨裁政治。則嚴厲禁止人民之言論出版自由。皆一任其意毫無顧惜。故憲法之臧否固爲一大問題。而憲法之能實行與否。則尤爲重大。然而此重大問題之解决。則又在於人民是否能眞實表現其堅决之意志。並眞實發揚其督促之力量耳。</p>

<p>重量七錢二成色八八八</p>
<p>法定規元價七錢一分五</p>
<p>造幣廠同時開始鑄新幣</p>
<p>財政部對於廢兩改元一事、曾於去年七月二十五日、如集銀業商會及專家組委員會研究、旋因新幣重量及成色等問題、遷延未决、日前宋部長曾與銀錢業領袖分别再行接洽、據新聲社記者探悉、决定三月一日實行、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>决定重量成色　財政部長宋子文在滬、日前分别與銀錢兩業領袖再行接洽、認爲廢兩改元、實爲切要之圖、并徵得同意、决定新幣重量與成色、照民國三年幣制條例爲原則、重量爲七錢二分、合二十三格蘭姆又丸七七九○四八、成色爲八八八、</p>
<p>法定規元價目　各業往來、現大都以銀兩計算、廢兩改元實行後、勢必折合銀元、如無規定具體辦法、勢必發生困難、現財政部已决定法定規元價爲每元合銀兩七錢　分五厘、實行後、各業銀兩銀元之折合、均照法定規元價、則可避免折合困難、</p>
<p>下月一日實行　至於廢兩改元實行日期、財政部已决定於本年三月一日實行、將令飭所屬各機關遵照辦理、但本市商會及銀錢兩業同業公會、截至昨晚止、尙未奉到部令、</p>
<p>自由開鑄銀元　中央造幣廠造幣機械自郭廠長改善後、以廢兩改元、將於三月一日實行、故開鑄日期、財政部已决定同時舉行、并准許自由請鑄銀元、即各業均可以銀元寳委托造幣廠化鑄、將來所鑄銀元、均爲孫總理像新幣、</p>

<h3 id="c189">怎樣完成地方自治？ <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>丨續昨日覆閭競明君來信丨</p>
<p>㈡足下說：［中國原來是一個大的農業社會，所以地方自治應先從鄉村着手］，這話也是自相矛盾。前面旣說［一地方之眞正自治，必須經濟文化開發到相當階段，始能成功］，那我們要問：鄉村的經濟文化是從那兒來的？明顯地說：農村需要機器犂，從那兒來？農村需要小學敎師，從那兒來？農村需要設立圖書館，牠的圖書從那兒來？這一切一切不都是要城市供給麽？不是要城市的經濟文化逹到一定的發展階段才行麽？旣先要城市的經濟文化發展到一定的階段，然後方能談到鄉村的自治，那麽，足下的［地方自治應先從鄉村着手］，這句話，究屬什麽意思呢？城市旣然獲得經濟文化的相當的發展，而不讓其着手自治，這豈不是把城市的人當做［阿木林］嗎？足下何獨厚於鄉村而薄於城市呢？中國一般人士的最不通之論，莫過於［中國以農立國］這名話了，說這話的人，以爲只有中國是自古至今是以農立國，是一成不變的，獨一無二的社會現象，實在這是不　社會</p>
<p>發展史並且不讀西洋史的不通之論。在某一個歷史的發展階段上，一個國家者要經過農村經濟這一發展的形式，所不同者，有久有暫，　得這一點，那你就不會把以農立國這幾個字，做爲中國的專利品。中世紀的歐洲各國差不多都是以農立國的經濟制度，法國到了大革命時代還是農業的國家，美國初期也是農村經濟佔優勢，俄國在十九世紀初期也還是一個龐大的單純的農業國家，怎樣能以把以農立國或如足下所說的［中國原來是一個大的農業社會］，來做爲中國地方自治應該先從鄉村着手的根據呢？然而中國一班士大夫以及多數敎育界中不通的敎員之倡說［中國以農立國］這種議論，都不是盲目的無意見的，而是有他們的利害做背影的。一般代表地主，封建殘餘，都要藉這一理論丨中國以農立國！的烟幕，掩護他們的保守或開倒車的傾向。老實說罷：只有城市領導鄉村的社會發展的形式，沒有鄉村領導城市的社會發展的形式（自然，在某程度上，鄉村的變動也可影響城市，然非所論於主要的和領導的作用），那麽要講地方自治。也只有先從城市講起，這是一。地方自治不是一個孤零的社會現象，而是全社會的整個的政治組織與經濟制度的一體，若果離開整個的社會變革而談地方自治，那實在是只看見樹而沒有看見森林，這是二。眞正的地方自治如我們前面所舉的，不是法律或命令所給與的和平的恩惠而是羣衆社會運動的結果。不從實際的行動獲得來的地方自治，那只是官許的地官自治，只是獨裁的另一方式，這是三。地方自治是無條件地普通的。不能以什麽經濟文化的程度爲靳而不與的藉口，這是四。至於足下所謂［民敎專家］，並不能做爲地方自治的先决問題，更不能做爲地方自治的主體，他們只是地方自治的一種機械，一種工具，一種技術人才，就是說，他們的研究並不是［鄉治前途之一綫曙光］，而鄉村的最大多數的羣衆感覺自治的迫切需要，大家團結起來，走到街頭去做實際工作，才是眞正地方自治的一線曙光，這是五。足下以爲如何？㈢梁漱深先生對於鄉村自治的批評的全文，我們沒有看見，然僅就足下所舉　點，也就可見一斑了。梁先生的說話，本來無在而不帶有玄學的色彩，我們對於他的言論，實在有些莫明其妙，㈠［以辦學堂一樣的作法，增進鄉村富力，則怕細末得很］，那末，該應用什麽方法來增進鄉村的富力呢？而所謂［辦學堂一樣的作法］又是怎樣的一種作法呢？這便是一種囫圇吞棗的說法。㈡［產業發達，文化始能增進］，究竟誰來發達這種產業？爲誰發達這種產業？所謂文化又是什麽　種文化？梁先生均未加以詳細的界限，所以依然是一種囫圇吞棗的說法。㈢［以辦敎育的法子，作鄉村改進運動，必落人才錢財一概倒貼之路］，這話又是在弄玄虚！梁先生說的，究竟是什麽一種［辦敎育的法子］？爲什麽辦敎育的法子，一應用到鄉村改進運動，便要［人才錢財一概倒貼］？果然，這種辦敎育的法子。本身就要塌台。牠不但應用在鄉村改進運動上要落人財倒貼，即施之於敎育本身，也恐怕不能免此種弊害。實在說來，所謂人才錢財一概倒貼的話，根本就不知所謂　梁先生還是讓他去講他的什麽［㈠西洋生活是直覺運用理智的：㈡中國生活是理智運用直覺的：㈢印度生活是理智運用現量的］，那些玄之又玄的唯心哲學的好，若果其要講我們的地方自治，實在用不着他的高論！至於足下所謂［不如此又將如何？還有什麽高妙的法子］？看了我們上面的解釋，或許不會再有這樣地懷疑了吧？足下又以爲何如？</p>

<p>— 潘</p>
<p>在這一次國貨貨運動中，金融界和工商界爲謀積極的建設，創辦中國國貨公司，不獨是國貨　的重要紀錄，更是中國國貨運動史上値得紀載。這似乎僅是推銷方面的合作事業，但也是產銷合作的第　步工作，所以國貨公司在將來國貨運動的前途，實在也負有重大的使命。</p>
<p>此次主持國貨公司的，多是工商界有實力的領袖，在進行方面，當然有請詳完美的計劃。以副全市市民的期望。可是此次國貨公司不獨，各業各地所注　，而且這次公司的成敗，關係國貨事業的　譽很大，所以我們固然希望市民同胞服用國貨的决心，盡力培植這新興的國貨事業，同時更希望國貨公司的同人，抱服務犧牲的决心，從事於這負有重大使命的事業。</p>
<p>關於主持事業的决心，因爲切身的利害，自然會努力於本職，更能明白這是社會的事業，益加警愓，減去一切不良的私見，光大我國貨的地位。至於一切服務公司的同志，更須力除一切不良的舉動，蔚成模範店員的風氣，因爲普通商店損失一個主顧，只是一個商店的損失，而國貨公司方面的損失，則影響到整個的國貨界呵！</p>
<p>以往我們曾悲憤於一般商人的專賣舶來品，但是他們都拿國貨不易推銷作答覆，如今專以銷售國貨的國貨公司開　以後，這固然是　們國貨生產界自己檢點改進的機會，更是一般商人對於國貨銷路的測騐的機會。而且，近今重慶青島汕頭各地工商界領袖，都在進行着這項事業，關於我們上海方面的成敗，實在足以影響他們的行止的。所以國貨公司不只是國貨運動中的新事業，而且是國貨運動的中心事業，我們應出全力的來主持。而尤其大家要有責任心自信心和犧牲心，不只爲己，要爲人，不僅顧到私業，要顧到全局，不要僅注意於銷，要注意到產。不僅專利生產界，還須顧到消費者。</p>
<p>這固然只是銷售主面合作的開始，但也是產銷合作的嚆矢，我們要得將來從事生產購買以及同業各項大聯合，必得先在這次建立基礎。所以，無論對内對外，我們爲着整個的國貨運動，我們應無時或懈的注意中國國貨公司，扶助中國國貨公司。</p>

<p>吳藴初先生是中國化學工業界的威權者，味精固然已建樹了功績和地位，近年更從事於電化的工業，對於新興國貨工商界站在領導的地位，而於國際生產界也都是迎頭趕上去，聰明和眼光，殊堪欽佩。但是吳先生本人絶未自滿於目前的境界，所以去年復往歐美考察，這種研究進取的精神，在我國工商界中尙屬僅見　月前吳先生返國，記者到天廚廠去拜謁，承談此次旅行雜感，多有足爲我工商界作參考的，特爲介紹於後。</p>
<p>吳先生此次出國的目的，在作技術方面的考察，經過日美英法意比等國，參觀工廠七十三所，包括電化，綠氣，燒鹻，製膠，澱粉各種工業，總是和吳先生現在所辦的事業有相當的關係；而吳先生設計中的淡氣，纎維化學工業，這一次在考察時更加注意，并隨時研究，現在圖樣計劃都已成就。在此次旅程中、吳先生曾有詳細的日記，因爲關於技術方面的記載較多，所以記者只向吳先生談些關於此次旅行的感想，尤其是對於我們中國國貨工商界有關係的。</p>
<p>關於生產方面，據吳先生的觀察，自九二九年以後，因機器和科學管理的進步，外國由　工過剩到生產過剩，形成目前的失業的狂瀾：但是關於化學工業方面，在歐洲有　多的工廠中，仍舊多用　工，因爲比較準確的緣故，所以我們新興的國貨生產界，最好不要蹈人　轍，　味學時髦，至於機器，外國工廠　也有　多的舊機器，并沒有廢棄，仍舊在生產着，我們中國人的謬誤觀念，也應　滌除才是。生產原料問題，主張大量生產的美國，有時却不免浪費：法國則對於　頭木屑也寳貴的珍藏，連垃圾也有用塲，以熱力作動力，渣滓做建築材料，絲毫不肯浪費。</p>
<p>尤其能使我們觸目驚心的，近代的戰爭已經　物質的戰爭，各國的工業界於普通的生產以外，要兼顧着國防的使用，不單警察已經是國防軍隊化　一般工廠丨著名的如德國的克魯伯法國的許乃特，都可以隨時改成兵工廠。我們於這國難重重的環境中，看到他人深謀遠慮，想到自己的毫無準備，應該又生如何的感想，這一點，實在是不能不報告給我們國貨生產界的。</p>
<p>所以，吳先生根據於他人所給予的剌激，决定放棄利益較大的生產，着手於綠氣和淡氣的工作：據說，淡氣是炸藥的重要原料，國防上的必須品，但是在承</p>

<p>— 天虚我生</p>
<p>大陸商塲的中國國貨公司，今天開幕了，我是剛從無錫回到上海，因爲不很明　内容辦法，還道是九廠聯合的一種組織，直到一月六日方知所售貨品，並不限於九廠，凡是國貨工廠所產物品，自願送去陳列寄售，他們都是很歡迎的，因此我就趕緊把無敵牌的各種出品送去參加，却有數種感想如左　　製造家方面，向來每感陳列發行的困難，自設一店，往往因所售物品，太形單調，反不如　爿小百貨店，花樣來得多些，所以往往等於虚設，結果，開　多而買主少，連本帶利，以抵房租夥食，尙屬不敷，就不免於收歇，而在售價方面，尤爲　　，明明一元之貨，批與别家，不過幾角幾分，但在自己門市，决不能照批價零賣，否則販賣商無利可圖，必向要求折减，足使固　之地位，因而搖動，但在販賣者方面，反而有紳縮之　能，例如大廉價時，往往特將一種最有價値之繁銷品，故意犧牲一點，吸引買主上門，而在别種貨品上，取得厚利以資調劑，在這種情形之下，自己所設門市店中，所售同一商品的價格，必不能與一般低减，因而惹起買主疑問，意謂本廠貨反比别家賣得貴些，於是以一傳十，舉一反三，反而有傷買主的好感，豈不是做了一個反廣告呢，現在有了國貨公司，可以代爲陳列發行，就可免得自設門市店了，這是我們製造家的一個很大的便利，我很希望各地製造家，大家趕快把自己所有的出品，儘量的放大膽子，送到公司裏去寄售，無論如何，這一種實物廣告的效力，一定要比任何廣告之力爲大，而在買主方面，則覺應有盡有，不致抱缺東少西之憾，譬如說，有一買主上門，存心要買甲種牌號的某一商品，而偏偏無以供應，以致勉强嘗試，買好乙種牌號的同一商品去，如果乙種商品，果然　了，買主的信用心，當然由甲而移至乙，以後一定舍甲而取乙，這一種的移轉信用，豈不是在甲乙雙方，一得一失，所關於營業前途之影響，實重且大，所以我想任何製造有家旣有一種出品决不可自甘落伍，不去加入，而在國貨公司方面，旣以推銷國貨爲目的，普遍徵求，也是一個極重要的工作，因爲買主上門，不論交易多寡，而全部開支所出，胥在積少成多，假使專誠到此，存心要買某種貨品，　走徧全塲，並未得見，當然免開尊口，望望而去，自己還怪自己走錯了門路，以後不再上門，那就生意日見清淡，并支從何而出，所以我想公司方面，一定要普徧徵求，凡有著名繁銷的國貨，一時不及應徵，即用現錢批購少量，以應買主的需求，免得望望而去，我想現錢進貨，一定可以得到格外的便宜，公司得到格外的便宜，買主也就可以得到格外的便宜，這是一個自然的公例，我很希望同一商品，不必限於同一商人所出，雖其價格高低不一，而買主所得的結果，無不比較購自别處爲廉，那就口碑載道，國貨公司的門檻，縱然是鋼鐵做的，也會踏斷了呢，</p>

<p>演講</p>
<h3 id="c197">辦國貨事業者應具之精神 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>池君宗　爲通成紡織公司創辦人之一，對於該公司之創設，頗多　劃，最近池君在中華國貨產銷合作協會演講［辦國貨事業者應具之精神］，語長心重，别有見地，記之於此，以爲從事工業者之座右銘也可，（光前記）</p>
<p>敝廠經營的係飛花工業，此年十年前方有工廠從事經營，原料係棉頭紗廠的下脚及油花等等，普通紗廠所有的飛花，在十年前，自己不會利用，都賣與洋商，運往外國，紡成紗，織成布後，再銷至中國，利權外溢，不可勝計，後來上海民生紗廠有鑒於此，自行發起此項工業，廠去即隨之仿行，向德國購機創辦，鄙人本不事工業，惟以銀行代表關係，忝居副經理地位，斯時以油花紡紗，成績欠佳，益以民國十三年齊盧之戰，商業蕭條，銷路呆滯，資本週轉不靈，遽告失敗，翌年，重又開廠，銳意整理，居然紗也紡出來了，新的廠屋也建築了，一切進行，頗有頭緖，不料民國十六年革命軍興，混亂一時，幾乎前功盡棄，後經一番整頓，始能稍復舊觀，斯時祇知　製造圍巾吕宋帽襪子等，但我終想物盡其利，使能製成布，後到一家洋行，買了一座機器，研究製呢，起初製成的呢，品質惡劣，不堪入目，繼經窮盡心血，努力研究，方能製成可以服用的呢，逐後更能製造絨布和氈子，現在所有出品，花樣適意，各色俱備，絶非創辦時所能意及。研究製造的中間，曾以資本不夠，頗多困難，幸蒙各界愛護有加，方克告成。當製造軍軍氈的時候，很受一番挫折。那時軍政部方面，不信中國人自己製造的軍用氈，是足以應用的。後交商品檢騐局化騐結果，敝廠出品，實爲優良；質地純潔，毫無油雜，駕舶來品而上之。至此當局始信國貨界有長足之進步，而敝廠出品，亦因此博得了一個好評。至所製絨布，據某外國人語我，足與日貨相頡頑，此或係過甚之譽，但昔日廢物，今能利用，實是快人快事。</p>
<p>惟余尙有引爲遺憾者，經營十年，所成者祗絨布與氈子兩種，因此個人遂生了以下幾種感想。</p>
<p>㈠從事國貨的，起初一定要失敗，失敗後一定要再幹。看中國歷史上的劉邦，他累敗累戰，再接再厲，最後終是戰勝了楚霸王，大定天下。可以從事國貨的，應該有這種［不倒翁］的精神，倒後再來，愈倒愈要來，百折不回，萬志不磨，終究有成功的一天。惟事業可失敗，人格則不能失敗；因人格爲事業之靈魂，人格一去，縱有回天之術，事業永無成功之望。</p>
<p>㈡中國人心理往往存［差不多］三個字，這三個字實是成功之敵。每每失之毫厘，謬之千里，辦工業的萬不能有［差不多］的心理。一事一物，應脚踏實去去細細考查，遇有問題發生，更應不厭其詳，敲釘轉脚的從長研究。這樣即非爲成功的資本，亦可杜絶失敗的來源。㈢辦工業的不能怕麻煩，假使一個廠怕麻煩，事事想求其速成，使其簡單，那就要出大毛病。所以辦工業的，非但不應怕麻煩，且應找麻煩的事做，愈麻煩愈要研究，愈要去做；因天下事愈怕麻煩，麻煩愈會找到你，事情就愈演愈麻煩。麻煩的事，在起初做了，就不再麻煩，不做就成了終身的麻煩。昭乎此，辦工廠的就不會出什麽岔子。</p>
<p>㈣辦工業應取法［唐僧取經］的精神，廣羅人才，和衷共濟。以唐僧如此文質彬彬臨風欲倒之人，去西藏去取經，路途遙遠，妖魔遍野，原爲不可能之事；但因有孫行者猪八戒沙和尙三人，形影相隨，同心協力，沿途很忠實的衛護，終究達到目的，辦工廠因爲一件難事，猶如唐僧到西藏去取經一樣，但如有像孫行者猪八戒沙和尙等的人才，投身其間，任勞任怨，忠勇做事，必有成就。</p>
<p>㈤從事國貨事業者，要具最大的决心，中國人常云：［天下無難事，只怕有心人，］又云：［精神所至，金石爲開，］從事國貨事業者，就要有這種决心來奮鬥，時時把國貨放在心上，然後能造國貨，造好　國貨，造樂爲人用的國貨。㈥現在外國人經營的事業，技術旣精，管理又善，而資本又雄厚，從事國貨事業的，要與之競爭，非有幾分　氣不可，幾百年前，歐洲有一實業團，覺得太陽非常討厭，立誓要發明一種東西，來蓋掩牠，即中國從前也有［愚公移山］的故事，這些事情看起來，好像很　，但辦國貨工廠的，應有這種　氣，自己一世做不好，讓子子孫孫做下去，終有成功之一日，假使要屈指計算在何時一定成功，這件事情决不會成功的。</p>
<p>平的時候，却可製造　鹽和硝酸鹽（肥田用），機器更可以製造Ｍｅｔｈａｎａｌ（汽油代用品），并不因沒有戰事而失去銷路。</p>
<p>美洲的僑胞，因爲國内連年兵災匪亂。，在國外多有此間樂，不思曷的心理，對於祖國投資開發實業，大家雖多很同情，但因爲綁票等等危險，加之已往華僑曾投鉅資於幾項事業，結果都是慘敗，所給予的印象極不好。吳先生鄭重的對記者說，我們如果要華僑回國來爲祖國生產界效力，我們的事業以後只能成功，不可再有失敗了，這才可做起信用呢最後，談到日本的近事，可以做我們的借鏡，更可以告訴我們一件驚人的消息！</p>
<p>［此次上海戰事，日本還感覺到飛機彈畢克里酸的不好，决定改用過綠錏ＮＨ６ＣＩＯ４和木屑，重油鐵矽ＦｅＳｉ的混合物；現在爲獎勵人民製造起見、政府對於每噸三百五十元成本的物品，給價一千二百元，已有很多工廠在日夜加工製造。（按：鐵矽Ｅｅｓ，帶Ｔｈｅｒｎｅａｌ性質，可以放火。）］</p>
<p>這固然是侵略者野心勃勃，但是被侵略的我們呢？難道是垂手待斃不成麽？我們的談話在這時候停止，可是這深刻的印象，仍舊盤旋在我的腦際。</p>
<h3 id="c198">戰壕生活和愛用國貨 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 吟閣</p>
<p>戰壕生活是怎樣？所穿的軍衣是呢污的當然不能更換，儘量污穢，潮濕，寒冷，要忍耐着。所吃的粗飯冷菜，能飽就算。日夜不能安睡，或者因爲倦極，倚在土床上睡着了，因砲聲炸彈聲又驚醒了。</p>
<p>用木頭木板或許鐵片所支持的小房間，用泥土沙袋擁護着的小房間，不時因砲彈或炸彈而破壞。隆隆的砲聲彈聲，漱漱落下的呢土，這是戰壕中惟一的點綴。</p>
<p>有了國貨不肯用，說這東西穿起來不好，吃起來不好，用起來不舒服。必定說來頭貨好，甚至說東洋貨好。試想想愛國的兵士們，在戰壕裏的生活是怎樣？老實說穿的吃的用的，國貨樣樣有，不過的確是不及外國貨優美舒服。但是吾們如果能常常聯想到戰壕中的衣食住，那末就是不優美不舒服就馬虎一些罷！</p>

<p>— 杜重遠</p>
<p>關於縱的方面；一，限制輸入，二，取消一切苛捐雜稅，三，運輸不生阻碍：四，政府協助。前三者本爲我政府朝夕所努力而迄今尙未克實現，若是我國内政治這樣混亂不息下去，那麽至少在短時期内不能實現。至於最後一點，若是政治上軌道，那是不生問題的，但是在這種塲合之下，並非絶對沒有辦法，要補救上述各點，也只有我們民衆自己來做。怎樣做呢？先用宣傳的方法，引起民衆樂用國貨的觀念。近年來國内工業出品有極速進步的成績，所有出品，確可與舶來品貌美，且有幾種竟駕乎外貨之上，但國人因爲長久地受了外貨的包圍，有了役卑鄙的傳統觀念，終懷疑國貨是趕不上外貨的，即可較好的國貨，亦多多誤認爲外貨，若國貨工廠界能夠利用宣傳，一方面告知民衆以外人在中國經濟侵略的危機：一方面闡明國民用國貨的天職，用傳敎的方式在民衆前誠懇地宣傳，同時各商埠，各市鄉，設置國貨陳列所，引起民衆樂用國貨的興趣與認識，更可惜了各處國貨陳列所舉行一切民衆娱樂，改善民間一切不良的習慣，并灌輸民衆新的知識，使民衆對於外貨生出良心上的厭惡，一致屏棄。假如這樣切實地做下去，那麽這種力量，實亦至偉。次之由生產界和消費界共同努力來把苛捐雜稅取消，以减少生產界的成本，間接即以減少消費者的負擔。再次於運輸方面，現在擇外貨能達到的地方，作推銷國貨第一步努力的地方，逐漸的進入鄉鎭也不是十分難能的事。</p>

<p>俄國之海關至爲嚴厲。苟非曾購俄貨之國斷不能求銷路於俄。且必以價格相等之貨互相抵俏。</p>
<p>吾國海關尙不能完全自主。然各人如能自行檢點，苟非能生產出口貨者，决不用進口貨，則進口貨必銳減。譬如普通之人多數不能生產運銷外洋之物品，則其人即無購用洋貨之權利。每見一般不能切實講求學問注重生產之人，每樂購洋自命開通。此種人實亡國破家之根原也。</p>

<p>以上所述乃五十七年前之文字。李小池先生在美國博覽會之感想，與國貨似無關係。然日人銳意維新，於博覽會能注其全力。此種精神大可與國人以一種剌激。</p>

<p>— 程守中講洽成記</p>
<p>第一：國貨工商界應該有一種聯合，聯合的利益當然爲在座諸君　深悉的，可以不必多贅；如劉鴻生君火柴搪瓷廠的合併，康元製罐廠和其他製罐廠的合併，這種事實更足以證明聯合的趨勢和需要。至於聯合的方法有兩種，一是同業聯合，一是各業聯合：聯合以後可以做下列的重要工作：</p>
<p>㈠研究的工作：研究如何分類的方法，因爲分類以後才可以明白什麽貨要送往何處去賣，特别的歸特别，普通的歸普通，推銷才能便利，而我國現今工商界關於推銷門徑似乎有的已經走錯了，吃虧不小，關於這項問題，個人另做一篇文字討論，現不多贅。</p>
<p>㈡同業聯合後，一切推銷，廣告購買原料各方面都可以聯合進行，人力和財力，同時都比較經濟些。第二；中國目下的市塲組織并不十分健全。金融機關和工商業缺乏聯絡，影響國貨推銷問題，仰　先生在申報國貨周刋關於這問題。曾有主張，我是非常贊成的。次則中國現在沒有躉售商，即是有幾家也是不健全。據上海市社會局統計，五千人以上的工廠很少，而小的工廠很多；這許多小的工廠資本并不十分充足，倘是把躉售商健全起來，有堆棧和金融的幫忙，對於這許多小的工廠有很好的幫忙，可以將推銷的責任完全交給躉售商，因爲小工廠多是一個人主持，從購買原料到推銷，都是一個人負責，精力有限，所以要分工合作，由小工廠專管製造，躉售商主持推銷，對於生產生推銷，同有利益。這項意見，還是請今日在座諸位，詳加討論。</p>
<p>第三：關於購買原料方面，現在的廠家多由商人和掮客手内買的，事實上出售者所獲的很少，而中間經手人却獲利很多；我們明白中國國貨大部的消費者是農民，我們要增加生產，必須使他們消費量增加，爲要減少中間的剥消，更顧到農民的經濟我們應幫助他們舉辦產銷合作。</p>
<p>第四：舉辦產銷合作連環商店；最近上海籌辦國貨公司，多希望能負起這項使命，就是以上海的公司做出發點，和各地的公司成一連環商店，由這種連環商店負責推銷報關和分發的工作。</p>

<p>丨本月七日晚在上海西人青年會演講丨</p>
<p>學校敎育及社會敎育的概况</p>
<p>前晚（七日）九時一刻、西人青年會請市敎育局局長潘公展氏蒞會演講、講題爲［上海的敎育］、由謝福生　譯、題材内容雖多統計材料、而聽者並不感覺厭倦、蓋對於敎育事業皆富有研究興趣、故直至十一時講畢、始散、各外字報組記者、如字林西報大陸報等、亦均到會紀錄、聞西人青年會於十二月間曾請吳市長演講［大上海市政］一次、前晚潘氏之演講、不啻爲其［大上海市政］之一部分、將來該會尙須陸續再請市政府各局局長前往演講云、藥錄潘局長之演講詞於左、</p>
<p>主席、諸位女士、諸位先生、</p>
<p>現値國難嚴重時期、重要問題爲大衆所注意者自必不少、乃蒙西人青年會給我大好機會、使我今晚在諸位之前、作一番似乎乾燥乏味的談話、講到敎育、實在是慚愧而且深致感謝、我想、諸位一定都是對於中國之前途抱着無限的同情、而且深信中國惟一獲求的敎望、卽全在於中國人民之普受敎育、在中國整個改進之大計劃中間、上海自然是已經形成了一個重要的輪軸、而且將繼續着負荷此巨輪的工作、使全國其他各地都受着牠的影響而進步、</p>
<p>說到上海、自從一八四三年開埠通商以來、進步極速、現在全中國進出口貿易、上海有佔百分之四十光榮、不但如此、因爲上海敎育事業之發達、他又形成了一個文化中心、一九一七年（民十六）七月、上海特别市政府成立、其地位與江蘇省政府相等、直屬於中央政府、從前𨽻屬於上海寳山兩縣之十七市鄉、包含去年淞滬抗日戰爭中著名地點如閘北吳淞江灣眞茹等區在内、都劃歸特别市管轄之内、一九三○年（民十九）七月、又遵照新頒布之市組織法改組、定名爲上海市、市政府所屬職掌敎育的機關是上海市敎育局、就是目前由我在那裏主持、諸位更想、以三百五十萬人口之都市而可以用於敎育之稅捐却極有限、尤其是經過滬戰以後、經費更少、則此捉襟見肘之敎育局、其職掌範圍内所應爲大上海市民舉辦之事業、在事實上確已能夠舉辦的究有幾何、自可不言而喻、</p>
<p>就中國言、或小而言之僅就上海言、敎育事業發展之經過、初並未有通盤之籌劃、故就各種敎育機關之歷史一加推究、未嘗發見同條共　的現象、無論大小學校、其剏辦經營、都是各各獨立、而如何彼此合作、衹有待於適當的時機、因爲中國新敎育的萌芽、乃是近百年來海禁大開與外人接觸以後之反應、知道這一點、則敎育事業之參差、各不相謀、自然沒有一些奇異、我願根據了這一點、在時間所許的範圍内、將上海的敎育狀况大略陳述一番、恕我不明白、西人青年會爲什麽選擇下午九時一刻爲演講時間、恐怕講完要近十一點鐘、那時候人家一定都歸心如箭、要共唱［歸去來兮］了、那裏再要講這些淡而無味的演講、不過這個時間是已定的慣例、慣例是不容破壞的、還是少說閒話、趕快將把我要簡略一說的話、歸納在兩個節目之下、</p>
<p>㈠學校敎育的梗概丨從初等敎育以至大學、</p>
<p>㈡社會敎育的梗概、</p>
<p>我希望能在一小時内能完畢我所要說的話、因爲翻譯也需要相等的時間、本題爲性質所限、不免引用一些統計的數字、聽講數目、尤如嚼蠟、這是要請原諒　、］、</p>
<p>我且先說學校敎育、在這裏包括小學校、中學校、獨立學院、大學院、以及幼稚園、職業學校、要明瞭現在、不能不把過去的沿革略加敍述、</p>
<p>小學校設立最早的、要推一八七八年（清光緒四年）設立的梅溪學堂、一九三○年設立的養正學堂、敬業爲知縣王懋琨創設、其餘二校起初都是由私人創辦、</p>
<p>中學校之中、如一八六三年設立的兵工中學、和法天主堂敎會創辦的徐匯公學、美國長老會創辦的清心中學、私立南洋中學、私立青年會中學等都是很早、他如民立、浦東、澄衷、麥倫各中學、也都先後設立起來、</p>
<p>師範學校設立最早的、要算一八九七年南洋公學的師範院、到一九○四年、巡道袁樹勛改龍門書院爲龍門師範學校、清末、師範習所、紛紛設立、嗣又先後停辦、惟有務本女學所附設的仍繼續不輟、龍門師範到了民國成立以後、改稱江蘇省立第二師範、一九三○年、市政府設立新陸師範爲師範學校之最近設立者、</p>
<p>正式的職業學校、是由一九一八年中華職業敎育社創立中華職業學校開始、</p>
<p>正式的幼稚園、直到一九二九年市立第一幼稚園成立纔有、因爲從前幼稚園都附屬於各小學校的、</p>
<p>以上所說、不過是上海中小學的沿革、現在要略略說到上海市政府的敎育經費、因爲經費之多少與事業之成就是成正比例的、從前、在市政府未成立時、上海敎育經費並沒有一定、大半　着田賦帶徵畝捐和一部份房捐雜稅等等、一遇災荒歉收、敎育費、就受打擊、一九二七年上海市政府成立以後、財政實行統收統支、這是可喜的改革、敎育經費規定以至市歲收可分之念五爲標準、按一九三一年度預算丨丨一九三一年七月至一九三二年六月丨丨敎育經費雖沒有　到總收八百分之念五、但已占百分一二十强、現在把一九二七丨丨一九二八年度和一九三一丨丨一九三二年度的經費作一比較、就可知道市政府所辦敎育事業的逐年進步了、</p>
<p>一九二七丨　　　一九三一丨　　增加</p>
<p>行政費　四一·九一０·一三　一四二·三八七·０七　一００·四七六·九四</p>
<p>學校敎　二一四·五一五·九二　六三三·五一０·六二　四一八·九九四·七０</p>
<p>育經費</p>
<p>社會敎育經費　丨丨　四三·二六三·二九　四二·二六二·二九</p>
<p>敎育事業　二五一·三六五·五八　六八四·二四五·０一　四三二·八七九·四三</p>

<h3 id="c233">北方化的吳諺 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>爲着交通便利的緣故，吳憹　語裏面也雜有北方化的字句；不過，質量極少，佔着百分之一二罷了。</p>
<p>其一，是一個［上］字；蘇洲土日中，凡是上門上山上樓等［上］字，都讀作撞字的去聲；門上山上樓上等［上］字，都讀作浪子；但是，說到［馬上就去］，非但，［上］字讀作北音，連着［馬］字也讀作北音了。</p>
<p>其二，是一個［下］字；凡是下山下樓等［下］字，都讀土音；但是，說到［下不過去］，這［下］字便照着北音讀作諧駕切一了。</p>
<p>其三，是一個［玉］字；蘇　讀［玉］字，都作入　讀；北音欠缺入聲，故讀［玉］字彷彿［御］字。蘇人說到；［玉官要買玉麥丨卽珍珠米］；玉官的［玉］字讀入聲，玉麥的［玉］字讀［御］字，所以御麥的名　也是北方化。</p>
<p>其四，是一個［黃］字；蘇人讀［黃］字，和王字無别；獨有蟹黃蛋黃的［黃］字，都讀作荒字，這又是北方化了。</p>
<p>北音和南音，界判鴻溝，所以吳諺中的北音，是很少很少的；近來，小學校中有國語一科，實在是一種不南不北的話；南方人聽了好笑，北方人聽了益發好笑；沒怪社會上有幾句俏皮話，呌做：［天不怕，地不怕，只怕蘇州人打官話］。</p>
<h3 id="c234">說謊 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— 庸子</p>
<p>丨聊齋先生是謊聖丨</p>
<p>美國有一位大衆公認的說謊家，據說，近來因說了一個美國人認爲空前絶後的大謊由州長委爲［正式說謊者］，并給年俸美金一元，以資鼓勵。這［正式說謊者］此次所說的謊，是這樣的：［他曾見一裝有木製假腿的貓，用假腿擊死一頭鼠。］這幾句話，雖說得尙還像一個謊，但在　們聽慣謊話的中國人聽來，實在平淡得何足道哉。不料事事比中國進步的美國人，對於聽謊話的程度，幼稚到如此地步。</p>
<p>我們中國說謊的歷史，不吹牛，不說謊，還在唐三藏身經八十一災的若干年前，諸葛亮借東風那回事，更膛乎其後。假使定要說甚麽時候已有歷史。那大概要算煉石補大的女媧氏了。至於成部的謊話書，如夜談錄呀，子不語呀，那一部不是有頭有尾的謊話大全。聊齋誌異，更是一部膾炙人口，萬古不朽的謊話名著。可憐聊齋先生挖空心思，遺下了這樣一部泣鬼神而晦日月的謊話大著，祇供聽謊話過日了的中國人們作茶餘酒後消遣的讀物。假使聊齋先生生在美國，我想謊學博士的學位，不　問題，當然到手。各大學假使要挿入謊話學一科，當然要敦聘聊齋先生當敎授，年俸不知要比［正式說謊者］大上幾萬倍咧。現在倘使有人把中國所有的謊話書籍，整理一下，請幾位回國的留學生，抉其精華，編一部［中國謊話大綱］，到美國去銷售，非但可證明中國有數千年文化歷史，替中國抬高些地位，一方面還可發一票洋財，我想，那倒是一舉二得的好賣買。</p>

<p>丨洋洋大觀丨</p>
<p>記得某一天，在某烟草公司的圖畫廣告丨海外奇談錄上，看到一個奇聞，說是有一對孿生子，他們的父親祖父和外祖母也都是攣生子，我現在介紹給你們一個和此相類似的奇聞，以供茶餘酒後的談資，</p>
<p>清朝孫之騄，杭州人。著有二申野錄，名爲［二申］，是因此書所載，起自明朝洪武戊申，迄於崇禎壬申，有一節載的是：</p>
<p>［寗國府民楊杞者，其妻俞氏，年二</p>
<h3 id="c236">春 <a href="#c236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— 山丁</p>
<p>春去不必悲傷，春來也不必高興，在這都市裏，沒有嬌艶的花兒，</p>
<p>也沒有婉囀的黃鶑，</p>
<p>八以上成婚，便有娠，甚大，旣生，乃孿胎也，未幾，又得娠，而產亦孿胎也，自後連連得孕，自十六至五十二歲，通有十八胎，每胎悉是孿生，皆是男子，共有兒三十六人，亦皆長在，無一夭者，此婦亦無病，享中壽以上而終，</p>
<p>我覺得這位俞氏實在是一個怪人，竟會得受孕十八次，而且每生一次，總是兩個男孩子。現在的少奶奶，一個小孩就管不了，就要呌苦連天了，我們替這位俞氏想一想看，以後的幾胎，生孩子時，大的幾個足以幫忙了，倒不致十分受累，但伊在起頭的時候，至少要管八個小孩子。我們眞猜不到那時候伊是怎樣過日子的，一笑。</p>
<p>現在的世界，根本是一個矛盾的世界，所以一方面有人喊節制生育，一方面都儘多着國家，制諸條文，獎勵生育。聽說美國有一個鉅富，拿出一筆錢來做獎金，以獎給生育最多的一個小家庭。有一家，兩夫婦已大大小小有了二十五個子女，很有得獎的希望云云，但是拿來和楊杞的［三十六個］一比，則如大巫之見小巫，瞠乎其後了。</p>

<p>— 閩重樓</p>
<p>丨發生畸形的關係</p>
<p>在這時代中。金錢與肉竟發生了磁石和鐵般的密切關係。</p>
<p>有肉沒有錢錢，就使肉無活動的餘地有金錢沒有肉，就顯不出金錢的奇跡。</p>
<p>黃包車夫不苦着兩條腿，就吃不到油條大餅，妓女不應接嫖客，就得受鴇母的鞭打　駡，這不是肉爲金錢而活動嗎？大財主顧用幾個洋人保鏞，怕你綁票匪不退避三舍，本來犯罪是要處死刑的，因爲重賄而得解脫，這不是金錢顯露的奇跡嗎？</p>
<p>［臉］是肉的，所以金錢能使它發　　笑···的表演，［心］是肉的，所以金錢能使它發生悲喜···的情調，一切大人先生，摩登男女，販夫走卒···的肉，都和金錢發生着密切的關係。</p>
<p>有人說：［這年頭丨金錢與肉的關係，本來不必大驚小怪。］但是我想那些爲金錢而獻媚敵人的漢奸，和爲金錢而販賣　貨的奸商，因私利竟貽誤大衆，這種金錢與肉的關係，總不能看作一回平淡的故事吧！</p>
<p>畸形的社會中，金錢與肉儘管向着畸形的關係上發展！</p>

<p>探照燈在軍事上之效用，至爲重大，固已盡人咸知。惟有光探照燈之缺點，卽在戰爭時常爲敵方利用，偱光覓徑，反爲敵彈　準之鵠的，故軍事家對探照燈之實用，每以此引爲遺憾。至一九二七年間英國名科學家佩特氏Ｉ·ＬＢａｉｒｕ有鑒及此，窮年累用，悉心研索，遂發明無光探照燈，英文名爲Ｎｏｃｔｏｖｉｈｏｒ其構造形式，無殊尋常，惟其光線之發射，則非常人視覺所能感受者。考厥發明原理，純　採用日光中之紅線Ｉｎｆｒａ－ｒｅｃｒａｙ爲最大要素，蓋我人深知日光光帶，賅有紅撜黃綠青藍紫七色，而據光學家研究，紫光線外尙有一種［紫外線］，紅光線外則有一種［紅外線］，此兩種光線，均非常人所能目睹。紫外線化學作用極强，可以療治疾病，復可辨别物品之眞僞，近更發見紫外線有秘密通信之效用，紅外線光力極强，又名熱線一，其光波較紅光線約長一百六十倍。佩特氏卽在探照燈前裝置一種橡皮質之歛光器械，收歛各種光線，而僅使紅外線發射，同時更利用電照管ＰｈｏｔｏＥｌｅｃｔｒｉｃＣｅｌｌ之效能，使被射之對象，呈現於我人眼底，可以毫髮不爽。此種探照燈之發明，使世界軍事學家相顧失色，近經試騐結果，知其光線之［透射力］，較諸尋常探照燈加强至三百倍以上，雖昏夜重霧，均無阻碍。當作戰時一方運用此燈，同時更佐以觀測瞄準器械，如最新發明之電器聯動式觀測器；［維克預測器］Ｖｉｃｄｅｒｃｐｒｅｄｕｃｔｉｒ等物，足使彈丸無虚發，剷滅强敵於無形中云。</p>
<p>殺人音波，可以稱爲［死音］，蓋此種發明，係承麥蘇士之殺人光線［死光］而繼起者。猶如電話發明後有［電視］之發明也。按我人之耳器官，所以能感覺外界之聲音，係由音波藉空氣之振動，傳達於耳膜而觸著於聽神經者。因音波振動次數之多寡，以分别聲音之清濁輕重，一般音樂家更以音波振動次數之比例，及振動數之排列，發爲音程音階之說。經聲學家研究音波振動次數與聽覺之關係，知每一秒鐘音波振動數在十六次以下，人耳卽不能辨，而每秒鐘振動數在四萬次以下，人耳亦不能感覺。蓋耳官之感覺力殊有限，音之過細過巨者，均不能成聽也。由於此種定例之啟示，使一般科學家更注意於振動數更低或更高之境界，而思有所探討。至最近有美人胡特及羅密司二氏，任職於美國强司霍布司大學爲實騐物理學敎授，乃對振動次數最多之音波卽［高周波音波］作專門之研究，並實地試騐此種高周波音波之濳力及其效能，經幾度實騐結果，發見音波振動數每秒鐘在十萬次以上，卽其有殺人之可能性。於是胡羅二氏會同［美國合衆電氣公司］製造各種實騐機械，乃發明音波振動數每秒鐘竟達七十萬次以上之死音。此種音波有强度之灼熱性及猛烈之燃燒性，無論何種堅靱物質，如水晶之屬，當之立成虀粉。且有一種劇厲之化合刀，如水銀與水，平時絶對不能化合，而經此種高周波音波之奇異作用，二種液體卽混合而成［汞混］。凡人類及其他動物之血球細胞，一遇此種音波，立刻爲之破壞毁滅，而生命頓絶。　　出版界陳灨一先生編撰之青鶴雜誌第六期已出版，論評中有陳先生撰文題曰喜合肥南下，他如鄭叔問先生年譜，姚姫傳使湘魯日記，及名人筆記六種，均頗名貴，考據材料尤多。</p>

<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>隨着麥芽的露出土面，阿榮的媽竟抛下了小兩口子，到土地下睡覺去了。一個嶄新的土墳，在他們的家門的西南角堆出來了。兒子同兒媳哭出的熱淚，差不多把墳旁的雜草都燙壞了，可是，死的人仍然哭不活，</p>
<p>他們悲哀極了。</p>
<p>［不要再想啦，想也想不活。］</p>
<p>妻看着阿勞不歡樂，勸慰他。同樣，阿榮也勸解她：</p>
<p>［你也不要再愁了，反正她跟不了我們一輩子。］</p>
<p>這樣的互相解勸，把他兩人的悲哀勸開了。</p>
<p>不過，兩個人有着同樣的疑問，那就是：</p>
<p>媽爲什麽死得那樣快呢，才三天哪？］</p>
<p>到後來，兩個人全有着相同的解答：</p>
<p>［爲什麽？丨丨就爲的沒有多餘的錢！］</p>
<p>好在一個月後又有了新的奇跡了，這意外的事情，增加他倆無限的歡喜，而這歡喜後來克服了一切的悲哀。</p>
<p>小生物，在阿榮妻的肚子中，已經佔有了一個相當的部位。</p>
<p>這是多麽値得歡樂的事呀！</p>
<p>·············</p>
<p>過了年，青青的麥，已經長到一寸多高。是個晴和的日子，太陽高高的照着，阿榮光着脚，在淺水浜裏挖爛泥。把爛泥擔到麥田上，然後分散開，就算上了肥料。家家都趁這個好日子來挖呢。</p>
<p>脚上，腿上，身上，甚至於臉上都多少有些稀泥，但阿榮是不理會這些的，他仍然一下一下的挖，挖完了擔到麥田上，河浜裏漸漸挖出個大坑，麥田上堆了一個大團。天氣還有相當的冷，可是他的全身都在發癢，後來冒着滴滴的大汗。氣，呼呼的喘。</p>
<p>過一會，他倚在河浜崖邊躺下了，眼睛望着天。</p>
<p>天上有浮雲，有鳥雀，有太陽，他全都看見了。然後他低下頭往四處田間望，望着田間做活的人，望着過路的人，望到媽的墳。呆了一會。······</p>
<p>當他站起身又要下浜挖泥時，忽然看到妻在麥田上散起稀泥來了，並且已經散了好大一片，綠苗上蓋了一層黑東西。看一下，一想，不對，他急急忙忙走到妻做活的地方。問：</p>
<p>［怎麽，你做好一會了，快回去罷。］</p>
<p>妻沒有答，望着他，他身上有許多泥，她倒笑了一下。</p>
<p>［不要累倒了，不知道麽？］他再說。</p>
<p>兩人的眼光，不由的全集視在一塊地方，那包藏着一個小生命的地方。</p>
<p>［回去罷，到晚上我一定會弄完的。］他變成了催促。（未完</p>

<p>— 玄</p>
<p>白從日本帝國主義的大砲在四小時内打下了［天下第一在雄關］以後，大人先生們就罣念着北平文化城裏的古物。現在好了，平津尙未陷落，而古物已經裝箱待運；據說共裝三千大木箱，須得四列車方能運走；那麽，萬一不遠的將來平津失守，而古物無恙，大人先生們庶可告無罪於列祖列宗。</p>
<p>古物雖有三千箱之多，但到底只有三千箱，四列車出便運了走。比不得平津的地皮是沒有法子運走的。至於平津的老百姓，丨幾百萬的老百姓，更其犯不着替他們打算，他們自己有腿！</p>
<p>况且就價値而言，也是老百姓可憎而古物可貴。不見洋大人撰述的許多講到中華古國的書麽？他們嘲笑猪一樣的中華老百姓，却讚賞世界無比的中華古物呢！如果爲了不値錢的老百姓而去失了値錢的古物，豈不被洋大人所嘆，而且要騰笑國際？於此，我們老百姓不能不感謝大人先生們盡瘁國事的苦心！</p>
<p>然而别有心腸的日本帝國主義似乎並不因爲北平古物已走而就此放手。他們正在急急忙忙增兵到熱河邊境。我們用火車運古物，他們用火車運兵丨平津的老百姓眼見古物車南下却不見兵車北上，而又聽得日軍步步逼進，他們那被棄無告的眼淚只好往肚子裏吞。　　可惜洋鬼子的機械文明尙未臻萬能之境。不然，用一架碩大的起重機把中華古國所有的國寳，例如北平的三海大内，曲阜的孔林，南京的孫陵之類，一齊都弔上喜馬拉雅山的最高峯去，讓大人先生們安安穩穩守在那裏［長斯抵抗］，豈不是曠世之奇勛！</p>
<p>不過目前已經有四列車的古物待運，實在也是了不起的藎謀了，老百姓感激零涕之餘，應該高呼三聲···古物萬歲！</p>

<p>— 彭家煌</p>
<p>我們中國人有我們中國人的國粹，比方日曆照老法，看月亮圓缺就可以推得出朔望，那末，［陰曆］也並沒有什麽不好；旣一定要改成［陽歷。］索興痛快點改掉也罷，可是弄到許多年，仍然［陰］［陽］不知，衙門公司行牠們的［陽，］而房東太太娘姨之流則行她們的［陰。］近來是除洋人以外，不論新舊人物，總帶些［陰］氣，而［陰］的曆書也很盛行。差不多連許多摩登的女學生都記信了［初一］［十五，］合［陽曆］幾號幾號，一點也不會錯。但像前幾年那樣，［陰曆］被禁用，曆本買不着，朔望也就無從推知。你若問一個女人；［今天是</p>
<p>了吧，她却非常精細的推算出十天二十天後是［端陽］［重九，］該預備好棕了節禮。爲什麽好們要保存這國粹呢？其實說空也很値幾個錢。］因爲［陽曆］有些月份竟有三十一天，而［陰曆］每月至多祇有三十天。收房錢，領工薪，還是［陰］來得合算。假使沒有那個［陽，］也就無從取巧了。</p>
<p>談到度量衡，本來出有［制，］不過以前的［制］太舊，有流幣，應該來個［新］的。比方菜販，他說他的是正規的［制，］十六兩。也許是十六兩，但我們總以爲他的是十四兩，十二兩，不對，祗有我的二十兩，二十四兩，纔對。可是要調換一下却誰都不情願。</p>
<p>［新］的［制，］當然比［舊］的好。但據本市度量衡檢定所對社會局呈稱：［········改行新制···竟乘機漲價···並有揑造官器名目，欺騙兜售····將使本市辦理度政，本有利民之實，而蒙營利之名，影響威信···］這樣下去，怎麽辦呢？</p>
<p>［新］的［制，］剛剛開頭，就又［舊］了，我想最好再來一個更新的［制，］永遠絶無流幣的更新的［制。］否則我們祗好關了［新］的洋學堂，勸人多讀［舊］的聖賢書：［正心，修身，齊家，夫然後可以國治天下平。］</p>

<p>［怎麽還沒有一點消息呢？］</p>
<p>他燥急起來了。再看了看手錶，比剛才看時只是過了七分多鐘，他又微吁了一口氣。</p>
<p>［像那樣無聊的女性，不要理好了！那裏値得我這樣地爲她　倒呢！我要爲佩珠守身如玉！］</p>
<p>他再拚命地抑着自己的慾念，閉了眼睛。他想能夠這樣地睡下去，總算是幸福的。一切都等到明天算總賬吧。</p>
<p>他目陰目陽地昏迷了一會，又像給什麽意外的　　驚醒了。他再看手錶，快要到一點半鐘了。</p>
<p>［眞是豈有些理！他硬敢不上來看我了！明天要質問好去！若不得圓滿的答覆，就要向她下最後的通牒了。最後手段是從這家裏搬出去！］</p>
<p>他愈想愈嘔氣，在打腹稿，明天質問她時，要怎樣地措詞才好。</p>
<p>［她是非常刁滑的女性。明天縱令質問她，也沒有什麽結果的。她一定和前次一樣，說着見自己睡着了，不敢驚動。····這才氣她不過！］</p>
<p>他一翻身坐起來，把掛在椅背上的長棉袍兒披在背上，穿上了拖鞋，决意下二樓去打聽她的動靜了。</p>
<p>［給她看見了不難爲情麽？·····不要緊！自己是有正當理由下來的，看見她就到洗浴間裏解手去！］</p>
<p>他在樓梯口，望了望二樓下面，只是一片黑暗。</p>
<p>［他們都睡着了？這才好，談我下去看看她和那個日本佬在做些什麽事體！······］</p>
<p>借着自己房裏的燈光，他摸着梯沿，走下二樓來了。他立在鶴子夫人的房門首，按着胸口的動躍，傾聽了一下裏面的動靜，但聽不見一點什麽聲息。他再凝神靜氣地聽了一下，裏面似乎有一陣輕微的鼾聲，但辨不清楚是一個人的，還是兩個人的。</p>
<h3 id="c296">怎樣避免結婚後的悲劇？ <a href="#c296" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e296" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">296</a></h3>
<p>— 顧鳳城</p>
<p>戀愛好像飲葡萄酒，味道甜而濃，顔色是鮮紅的：在戀愛的過程中，有時可以忘記了一切。</p>
<p>戀愛的最終目的是結婚，結婚是戀愛的最後的歸宿。青年男女在熱烈的戀愛的過程中，時時刻刻所追求的，便是想達到結婚的目的。但是問題就來了，戀愛與結婚到底是不是兩個階段呢？有人說：結婚是戀愛的墳基；有人說：結婚是戀愛的歸宿。到底戀愛的生活幸福，還是結婚以後的生活幸福？這個問題已經被許多人討論過了，但是至今得不到一個結論，因爲各人的見解不同，各人所過的生活也不同，有人結了婚比戀愛時幸福，有人在戀愛時是很好的，結了婚便一切都幻滅了。</p>
<p>結了婚比戀愛時幸福，這種人當然最幸運沒有了；我這裏所要提出來的問題，便是我看見有許多人在戀愛時往往很熱烈很幸福的，而一結了婚，悲劇便發生了。</p>
<p>如何避免結婚以後的悲劇，這當然是値得討論的一個問題了。</p>
<p>現在就我個人的觀察，和在幾個友人處所得到的經騐，他們在結了婚後所發生的悲劇，不外是下列幾種：</p>
<p>第一，在戀愛時，一切以愛爲中心，雙方面祇有感情而無理智，各人的個性，脾氣，都被熱情所籠罩住了，即使他有壞的脾氣，在愛人面前是决不會發作的他一定温柔得如小綿羊一般，快樂得像小天使一樣，在那高度的熱情橫溢中，各人的不好的脾氣，壞的習慣，都隱蔽住了。所以在熱烈的戀愛中，一切以感情做了出發點，是很難發見各人的個性的不同的。不過結了婚後就不同了，因爲結婚生活是比較的平靜而入於安定了，各人的個性與脾氣也隨了結婚時期的長久而發作出來了，在戀愛時能犧牲的，在結婚後往往便不能犧牲了，在戀愛時看不出來的脾氣，結婚以後便完全發作出來了，從此二人間的悲劇也就發生，往往爲了結婚後的個性和性格等等的不同，以至於離婚，這是結婚後所最容易發生的悲劇。</p>
<p>第二，是各人生活習慣的不同。這在戀愛期中，也往往一時不易發見得出而且不爲雙方所注意的。因爲在戀愛時，雙方沒有過同居的生活，那麽雙方的生活習憤往往就不大容易發見不同的地方，而且在戀愛時期中各人的生活習慣即使有什麽不同的地方，雙方也願意互相讓步而犧牲。比如說：男的生活是喜歡動的，女的生活是喜歡靜的，在戀愛期中，如果男的常常要求女的出外游玩，女的有時雖然覺得不願意，但爲了要使他們的愛情沒有一點缺憾，往往就犧牲了自己的習慣，答應男的請求了。這種犧牲在結了婚後往往就不願了，比如說女的已有了小孩子，她更需要平靜的安定的生活，男的如果仍是繼續不斷的去要求她，她就要毫不客氣的加以拒絶，那時男的就要感到失望，幻滅，以爲他的愛人沒有從前的活潑可愛了，這樣下去，也是會繼送他們的愛的前途的。這是結婚以後第二種可能發生的悲劇。</p>

<h3 id="c297">談吸烟 <a href="#c297" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e297" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">297</a></h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>自己旣是抽烟人，所以關於抽烟，也有許多奇怪的了解，</p>
<p>吃過飯，必抽烟，上馬桶，必抽烟，讀書可以抽烟，做文章更要抽烟，與友人談，必須抽烟，然而與情人談，却不可抽烟了；理由很簡單，因爲許多女人，多半會給烟薫得傷心落淚的。</p>
<p>有許多人認爲抽烟只是人生哲學的一種，僅需當着人們面前點綴點綴而已，不必認眞，但是也有許多人却將抽烟當做生活要素，而且是不可一刻無此君，於是當他走上電車的時候，明明看見車上寫着不准抽烟的字樣，可是他偏要抽，並且滿口的向着人們臉上噴出，由此可知，這種人的烟癮，也就大得狠可以了。</p>
<p>烟有各種各樣，也許是因人而别。譬如說紳士先生必須雪茄，藝術家必須淡巴葫，老　多喜，［金銀］，小開愛吸［愛卿］，老爺應吸［高而富］，少爺當抽［美麗］，英名爲Ｍｙｄｅａｒ），有錢人當吃［吉士］牌，而窮漢們。只好吃烟屁股做成的［磕頭牌］，至於當此國難日深，外侮日亟的危急存亡之秋，我輩愛國志上，除了應當竭誠奉命提倡國貨而不抽。［神仙］（據說是劣貨）之外，更應當齊心協力的吸。［英雄牌］何况［吃烟救國］未始非救國之道。</p>

<p>這是人類生存所依賴而必須解决的問題，將來我們從何處得到原動力？電　和電車停止了作用，一切的烟筒不再吐着黑烟，引擎和馬達都入了睡鄉，假使煤和煤　都用完了。</p>
<p>這一天終於是要來的，現在已經有人估計出地球上的代僅足維持一兩千年的光景，假使煤的用途更擴大起來，或者不到一千年哩！煤油的情形也是這樣。</p>
<p>這不僅是將來的問題，而且成爲目前的問題了，有些國家的煤和煤油全恃外國的輸入，日本便是一例，侵略的事跡往往也由這個問題發生的。</p>
<p>果眞原動力的末日來臨了，强暴的武力，又到那裏去搶煤和煤油呢？何况武力的利器丨戰艦，坦克車和飛機也非原動力不能作用哩。</p>
<p>第一種新的原動力是水力，在美國可以說已經充分的利用了，我國的揚子江，據建設委員會工程師的報告，由重慶至宜昌已可得四百萬馬力，將來水力發電廠成立，牠的效力，固然宏大，所節省的煤量，尤不在少數。</p>
<p>其次，是利用潮水的力量，凡是到過錢塘看潮的人，都會想着潮水力量的偉大吧！現在美國已經在芳地灣中計劃着如何利用潮力。</p>
<p>第三種是太陽了，你曾想到太陽的熱量是多少嗎？在每一方哩的熱帶地方，牠所給的熱量抵得上一萬噸煤！至於如何收集這熱源，現在還沒有美滿的方法。</p>
<p>最後，是人造燃料了，大半是由　和一　化　加壓力和温度製成的，一氧化碳是幾種大工業的附產品，但　是氣和必須的壓力，温度，都依賴着其他原動力的存在，還不算有圓滿的成功，然而這一種燃料的特性，效力是偉大的，通常比汽油强一倍。</p>
<p>我們不能不發一個疑問，這些新的原動力會不會有完的一日呢？简括的說，水力和潮水的存在，完全和太陽的能力相關，太陽不毁滅，水力和潮水是不會休息的，太陽毁滅了，就有原動力我們又能做些什麽呢？</p>

<h3 id="e2">Special Committee Meets This Morning to Consider Japan's New Proposals <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Nine-Member Committee Held Evasive Meeting Intended to Delay</p>
<p>We Resolutely Oppose the League of Nations Accommodating Japan in Mediation</p>
<p>(Geneva) Although the nine-member drafting committee convened this morning, it only slightly discussed the Lytton ten principles and did not begin drafting recommendations, intending to bide its time and await the development of Japan's new proposals. Japan's new proposals are extremely skillful, and the Nineteen-Nation Special Committee has agreed to consider them tomorrow. The Special Committee's treatment of China and Japan is obviously unfair, and its indulgence of Japan only helps the Japanese army bully the League of Nations. (8th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>The drafting committee of the Geneva Nineteen-Nation Committee met at 10:40 this morning in the office of the League of Nations Secretary-General, but only discussed the wording of the ten recommendations in Chapter IX of the Lytton Report, and has not yet actually drafted a proposal. It is expected that if the Nineteen-Nation Committee decides at its meeting tomorrow morning that Japan's recent proposals are insufficient to change the situation, the drafting committee may reconvene tomorrow afternoon to draft the League of Nations' recommendations. It is reported that the drafting work of the committee is progressing very slowly, far less than expected. German committee member Von Keller told people that if the current situation continues, the League of Nations report will not be completed until the middle of next week. Spanish representative Zulueta returned to Madrid this morning, and his drafting committee duties were taken over by Madariaga. (8th Guomin dispatch)</p>
<p>The Geneva nine-member group met for a little over two hours this morning, and some progress has been made on the draft report. The meeting adjourned at 12:45. Secretary-General Drummond announced at today's meeting that he had received new proposals from the Japanese side, but did not submit them to the group, as copies had already been sent to the residences of the representatives of each country. The Nineteen-Nation Special Committee is scheduled to meet tomorrow morning to thoroughly discuss the Japanese proposals. The general impression seems to be that although the Japanese proposals are still subject to revision, they can serve as a basis for understanding. Under these circumstances, it is not surprising that today's discussion did not reach a conclusion. The draft proposal put forward by the Secretariat has been greatly revised today, and a number of points have not been agreed upon. A member of the nine-member group claimed that at least two more meetings are needed to reach an agreement. The draft this morning was based on the ten principles of the Lytton Report. The members of the group are extremely secretive about the content of the meeting, which has led to various speculations. The progress made today is related to the first few paragraphs of the report. As for the difficult points in the proposal, it is heard that it is about the form in which Japan's special interests in Manchuria, such as railways, should be recognized. (8th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) After the drafting committee adjourned this morning, the authorities solemnly declared that the committee's evasive meeting was absolutely harmonious. The members of the committee have not yet drafted a recommendation to not recognize [Manchukuo] and that League of Nations members should not cooperate with it, but since this point has been unanimously decided by the Nineteen-Nation Committee, it is expected that there will be no serious difficulties in drafting it. (8th Guomin News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Geneva hears that the new Japanese proposal stipulates that Japan accepts the explanatory statement drafted by the Nineteen-Nation Committee. The Nineteen-Nation Committee will now immediately begin studying it to determine that the last section of the explanatory statement, which declared that maintaining [Manchukuo] and restoring the situation before September 18th are not satisfactory solutions, is heard that Japan hopes that the committee will add some points in the explanatory statement that are favorable to Japan in the Lytton Report as a concession. Therefore, Matsuoka once claimed that since they want Japan to accept the Lytton Report, he does not see any reason why the points in the Lytton Report that are favorable to Japan should not be included in the basis for mediation. This is absolutely the last effort of the Japanese, etc. After Pinès and Eden received Matsuoka's proposal, they immediately discussed it in secret. It is still unknown whether Japan's insistence on adding some points in the Lytton Report that are favorable to Japan will be enough to eliminate the effect of accepting the last section of the explanatory statement (i.e., the statement on the puppet organization). According to a spokesperson for the British delegation, Matsuoka's suggestion needs to be carefully studied. In any case, the Nineteen-Nation Committee may feel that it is necessary to consider it before completing its draft recommendations to the League of Nations on the Sino-Japanese dispute. As for the content of the Japanese proposal, it has not yet been fully published. Matsuoka also refused to specify it when declaring its nature. If the League of Nations follows the Japanese approach to mediation, what steps will Japan dare to take? Some observers believe that once mediation is reopened, Japan will again propose a detailed proposal, including the new status of Manchuria that it is willing to accept, but when asked of Matsuoka, he remained silent.

<h3 id="e3">Our Delegation Sent a Letter to the Drafting Committee <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Insisting on Opposing Weakening the Original Plan</p>
<p>Treatment of Both Sides is Extremely Unfair</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to diplomatic circles, although the Nineteen-Nation Special Committee has ordered the Nine-Nation Committee to draft the recommendation part of the report, mediation is still in progress. Drummond is currently contacting Japan to request acceptance of the draft of December 15th last year, and to delete the section on the participation of the United States and Russia, and the section on non-recognition of the puppet organization can be retained. Our side resolutely opposes this and has formally declared by our delegation that it cannot agree. Mediation must be conducted simultaneously with both parties, and this action of accommodating Japan is naturally unbearable for us. Furthermore, in terms of mediation itself, if the United States and Russia are not invited to participate, the strength will be weak. If the non-recognition of the puppet organization is retained, the Sino-Japanese problem will inevitably be protracted. Therefore, diplomatic circles believe that if justice is to be upheld and peace maintained, the report must be drafted resolutely and Japan should not be accommodated. (8th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Chinese delegation sent a document to the nine-member committee this morning, stating that [in a document published by the Secretariat of the League of Nations on February 4, 1933, there is a declaration stating that the Secretary-General of the League of Nations notified the Chinese delegation on January 20 that the Nineteen-Nation Committee was preparing to revise the draft resolution and explanatory statement to conform to the wishes of the Japanese government. This declaration may be related to the meeting between Yan Huijing, the chief representative of China, and the chairman of the Nineteen-Nation Committee on that day. What should be noted about this matter is that on that day, Yan Huijing was only notified that someone intended to change the explanatory statement into a chairman's declaration and intended to delete the section inviting non-member states to participate in the mediation. Yan also received notification that Japan may make reservations about this declaration. Furthermore, the communique issued by the Secretary-General on January 21, 1933, regarding the explanatory statement also only stated that [the parties concerned are free to make reservations]. The communique issued on February 5 clearly pointed out that [the Nineteen-Nation Committee intends to formally recognize the right of the parties concerned to make reservations], which was previously unheard of. The Chinese delegation and the chief representative stated in the meeting with the chairman and secretary-general of the Nineteen-Nation Committee on January 20 and in the declaration issued on that day that they opposed all revisions that would weaken the original draft resolution and insisted that the principle of [Manchukuo] not continuing to exist must be clearly stated in the draft resolution and recognized by the parties concerned as the fundamental principle of the mediation process. In addition, a document issued by the Secretariat of the League of Nations on January 21 clearly indicated that the Nineteen-Nation Committee's attempt at a mediation process had failed and decided to draft a report in accordance with Article 15, paragraph 4 of the Covenant. The communique also stated that the mediation process stipulated in Article 15, paragraph 3 of the Covenant is only the result of the General Assembly. At this moment, if the parties concerned have new suggestions to put forward, the Nineteen-Nation Committee is of course prepared to accept them. (8th Havana dispatch)</p>

<p>Recognizing That the Outline of the Recommendations Is Barely Satisfactory</p>
<p>British Representative Still Suspected of Favoring Japan</p>
<p>Many representatives of small countries in Geneva are privately telling reporters that they do not approve of reopening the mediation process because they believe that the report drafted this time and the agreed-upon outline of recommendations to the League of Nations General Assembly are barely satisfactory and do not want to see their previous efforts abandoned. However, all nineteen members of the committee are telling the public that their main desire is to obtain a practical and feasible basis for compromise. A spokesperson for the British delegation told newspaper representatives today that Japan's recent proposals are closer to the original draft of the Nineteen-Nation Committee than any previous proposals, which shows that there is still hope for mediation among the major powers. It is also heard that British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Eden has telegraphed the Japanese proposal to Foreign Minister Simon in London on Tuesday night. However, although the British delegation has been more optimistic in recent days, it still occasionally reveals concerns about the difficult situation. Its spokesperson stated today that since China has not accepted Japan's proposal not to invite the United States and Russia, the Nineteen-Nation Committee will undoubtedly encounter difficulties in obtaining the consent of the two countries on this point alone.

<p>(Nanjing) According to observations in diplomatic circles, if the Nineteen-Nation Special Committee resolutely drafts a report, does not recognize the puppet organization, and does not cooperate with it, then this report will inevitably be supported by the United States and Russia. Since the September 18th Incident, the United States has repeatedly stated that it does not recognize the results of aggression, and Stimson reiterated this statement the other day. Russia has also consistently expressed opposition to Japan's aggressive actions. Therefore, if the League of Nations passes this report, the entire world, with the exception of Japan, will unanimously support it. (8th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e6">Japanese Representatives Fully Mobilized to Implement New Proposals <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) Matsuoka, Sato, and Nagaoka, all plenipotentiaries, carefully deliberated at 11:00 this morning on how to implement Japan's compromise plan. At 12:10 in the afternoon, Deputy Minister Sugimura also joined in. As a result of the close discussion, they all unanimously advocated that the success or failure of the reconciliation could be listened to, but if the mediation was abandoned due to misunderstanding, it would violate the spirit of the League of Nations and would be deeply regrettable. Therefore, it is necessary to implement Japan's claims to the Nineteen-Nation Committee. It was decided to visit the representatives of various countries from the afternoon onwards to explain the spirit of Japan's compromise plan and the situation in the East. That is, Plenipotentiary Matsuoka visited the representatives of Britain and the Czech Republic, Ambassador Nagaoka visited the representatives of France and Germany, and Ambassador Sato visited the representatives of Italy and Belgium to talk about everything. At the same time, in order to persuade the representatives of the small countries, the Japanese delegation has fully mobilized and started a major campaign. (7th Dentsu dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) This evening, Representative Matsuoka again visited Czech Foreign Minister Piniès and British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Eden to present the Tokyo government's recent proposals, claiming that Japan has exhausted its ability to remove the obstacles to reopening the path of mediation. When he met the two and came out, Matsuoka looked serious and told reporters that he could not guarantee that the new proposals would be accepted. He was neither optimistic nor pessimistic at this time. They will do their best and do everything they can. If the final efforts still fail, then they have done their best and there may be nothing to regret, etc. (7th Guomin dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) This morning, Foreign Minister Uchida stated to the Privy Council the progress of diplomacy with the League of Nations and expressed the government's determination. The advisors asked one after another what form the government would adopt to withdraw from the League of Nations if the League of Nations invoked Article 15, paragraph 4 to enforce mediation. Foreign Minister Uchida replied that he would consult the Privy Council at that time and seek the opinions of the advisors. From this observation, the Japanese government believes that the current situation does not seem to have reached the worst moment, so the convening of the main meeting of the Privy Council on the issue of withdrawing from the League of Nations has not yet been reached.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Privy Council extremely approved of the government's policy toward the League of Nations and was heard to strongly urge the Foreign Minister to adopt harsh measures when the League of Nations passes a proposal that does not recognize the importance of Japan.

<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Saito entered the palace at 10:30 this morning to meet with Chief Chamberlain Suzuki, listened to the content of the Chief Chamberlain's visit to Saionji in Okitsu, reported the government's attitude, and then attended the Privy Council meeting held in the East Liujian in the palace. Furthermore, due to the development of the League of Nations and its results, the government convened a special emergency cabinet meeting at 1:30 this afternoon to conduct important discussions on countermeasures against the League of Nations. (8th Dentsu dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) This afternoon, the Japanese cabinet held an emergency meeting to discuss strategies for dealing with the League of Nations. First, Foreign Minister Uchida stated the progress of the League of Nations in great detail, strongly arguing that there was no need to return the South Seas Islands when withdrawing from the League of Nations, and requested the cabinet members to agree with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' established policy. Some cabinet members expressed their opposition to withdrawing from the League of Nations, and Foreign Minister Uchida replied that the Japanese government had recognized the puppet organization. If the League of Nations' recommendation denies its independent existence and Japan does not provide assistance, it would be tantamount to putting the puppet organization in a stalemate, and its outcome will inevitably affect future policies toward China. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs originally did not like withdrawing from the League of Nations, but if the puppet organization is denied, then it cannot but make a final determination. This is an important key to the Japanese Empire, and I hope that the cabinet members will actively support it, etc. It is heard that the discussion did not yield results, and it is scheduled to be submitted for discussion at the next meeting.

<p>(London) When Foreign Secretary Simon spoke in the House of Commons today, he mentioned the current situation in Harbin. According to reports, the rumor that British expatriates in Harbin were being forced to organize a self-defense army was obviously inaccurate, but there were times when people were hired to protect them with weapons. However, since the British Ambassador to Japan protested to the Japanese side, the Japanese side has increased the police force in Harbin and adopted other necessary measures. No British person has been beaten in the recent three months. The murder of Mrs. Horderu on October 12 last year was the last case of a British expatriate being killed. (7th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>Chen Jitang to Visit Chiang in Jiangxi; Rumors from Zixi that No Bandits are to be Found</p>
<p>(Nanchang) In order for the Guangdong-Guangxi armies to enter Jiangxi on a large scale to assist in the suppression [of bandits], in addition to Representative Li Shangyong stationed in the province as liaison, Yang Dezhao was dispatched to the province to meet Chiang, discuss military affairs in southern Jiangxi, and request instructions on everything (Eighth Daily Special)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chen Jitang decided to increase the dispatch of Li Hanhun's division to Jiangxi to suppress the Communists, expanding the division into an A-grade division. Rumors that Chen Jitang and Bai Chongxi will go to Jiangxi to discuss bandit suppression with Chairman Chiang (Eighth Daily Special)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Xiong Shihui, because southern Jiangxi has been half-occupied by bandits and is the location of the bandit center, yesterday summoned important figures familiar with southern Jiangxi to discuss strategies for advancement and suppression, which were submitted to Chiang for implementation (Eighth Daily Special)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) The Ministry of Military Affairs, in order to carry out large-scale suppression, has sent personnel to Jiangxi to inspect and expand various military hospitals (Eighth Daily Special)</p>

<p>(Nanchang) A person from Jiangxi stated that the Guangdong-Guangxi armies on the east bank of the Gan River are only adopting a defensive posture south of Ganzhou, without taking a step north of Ganzhou. Moreover, the fake 8th Army on the west bank of the Gan River appears in Chongyi, Shangyou, and Suichuan, and the fake 20th Army on the Fujian-Guangdong border harasses Anyuan and Xinfeng, while the fake raiding teams are erratic in the Ganxian area. The Guangdong-Guangxi armies are even more powerless to take an offensive stance, and only after Chen Jitang and Li Zongren augment their forces will they be able to implement an attack towards Yudu, Huichang, and Xingguo to strike at Ruijin. After Zhu Mao Peng De received the news, they were extremely alarmed. The fake 3rd Army Corps is actually in communication with Fang Shao on the banks of the Gongxi and Xin River. When the Fujian-Guangdong-Guangxi armies advance to suppress them, they will flee around the border of Jiangxi, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Anhui. Previously, Zhu Mao moved from northwest Jiangxi to west Jiangxi to south Jiangxi to east Jiangxi. It is inevitable that they will move north again, circling and fleeing.

Huang carried Feng's letter and met with Chairman Chiang. According to Wang's statement to reporters, the meeting with Feng was positive. Since the central government is determined to resist Japan, in addition to writing to Chiang to offer his opinions on resisting Japan, Feng is also determined to come to Nanjing to face national difficulties together. Wang and Huang will stay in Nanjing for a short time. The date of their trip to Jiangxi to meet with Chiang is undecided (Eighth Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

After discussion, it was mostly recommended that the central government should assign him a practical and appropriate task and title. As a result, the central government will determine specific measures for this matter and telegraph Chiang to solicit opinions (Eighth Daily Special)</p>

<h3 id="e57">On the Constitutional Issue <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>The Legislative Yuan passed a resolution on January 20 to establish a Constitutional Draft Committee to prepare to draft a constitution, the fundamental law of the country. Sun Ke, Zhang Zhiben, and others have also repeatedly expressed their opinions on the constitution. The people of the country are also paying close attention. In the 20th century today, almost every country in the world has already formulated a constitution and uses it as the guiding needle for political measures. Only our country, since the late Qing Dynasty, has had an endless stream of calls for a constitution. However, a true constitution has never been successfully formulated from beginning to end. For more than 20 years, the national situation has been chaotic. The law has not been able to subdue the people, and politics has not been able to get on track. Therefore, today's formulation of a constitution so that the people of the country can be protected and that political measures can be based on is the most urgent task.</p>
<p>However, we believe that the constitution is the fundamental law of the country and the master of all measures of the country. Therefore, this kind of important work must not be sloppy or perfunctory. In other words, the true constitution must truly represent the interests of the people and meet the requirements of the people. We now ask to contribute our humble opinions to the gentlemen of the Constitutional Draft Committee.</p>
<p>First, we believe that the government, at the beginning of preparing to draft the constitution today, should first seriously ask itself whether it truly has the sincerity to draft the constitution. In other words, whether it truly has the determination to implement democratic politics. If the constitution is purely a formality, then the constitutional movement of the Cao Wu era has already made us feel cold to this day. We do not want to see this kind of false constitution and false constitutional government reappear before our eyes. This is a prerequisite. If this issue is not resolved, then the so-called constitution is a futile effort.</p>
<p>Second, we believe that the highest principle of the constitution should be based on the interests of the people. Under this highest principle, there should be no special interests of individuals or special interests of a certain group. The so-called constitutional government is democratic politics. One of the most difficult problems in democratic politics is that the interests of individuals and the common interests of the whole nation are often irreconcilable. Under this contradiction, the constitution eventually becomes a formality and democratic politics eventually becomes false. Almost none of the so-called constitutions and constitutional governments in Europe and the United States today can escape this category, that is, none are without numerous malpractices. Therefore, we believe that only the true will of the people is the true constitution, and only the true constitution can truly represent the interests of the people and not be the shield or tool of individuals or a few people. In today's constitution-making, if it cannot be firmly based on this foundation, then even if the constitution is successful, the people will not be able to enjoy its benefits.</p>
<p>Third, the formulation of the constitution should, on the one hand, be suitable for the social and economic needs of the country and the trend of historical habits of the country. On the other hand, it should also pay attention to not deviating from the trend of the times. As far as the constitution is concerned, there are clearly two categories in today's world. One is the constitution of the democratic countries of Europe and the United States, and the other is the new constitution of socialism in the Soviet Union. These two categories differ not only in form but also in substance. And these two categories are both suitable as blueprints for our country today. We should examine the trend of the times and never cling to established rules or run counter to the torrent of world thought.</p>
<p>All three of these are the most important issues in drafting a constitution. We sincerely hope that the gentlemen of the Constitutional Drafting Committee can clearly understand these issues so that this constitution-making work will not ultimately lead to a miscarriage. Furthermore, the formulation of the constitution does not lie in form but in implementation. A false constitution is often only a formality. It can be monopolized and manipulated by a few people, or it can be modified and destroyed by a few people. For example, Hitler in Germany today, in order to realize his dictatorial politics, severely prohibits the people's freedom of speech and publication, all at his own discretion without any scruples. Therefore, the merits of the constitution are certainly a major issue, but whether the constitution can be implemented is even more important. However, the solution to this major issue lies in whether the people can truly express their firm will and truly promote their supervisory power.</p>
<p>Su Bingwen Assembles a Large Army for a Counterattack</p>
<h3 id="e58">Japanese Newspaper Says it Will be Launched During the Thawing Season <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>The Nagoya News said that Su Bingwen, who is currently in Tomsk, was formally disarmed by the Soviet government when he entered the Russian territory, but in fact, he received quite favorable treatment from Soviet Russia. Recently, the volunteer army has been actively planning. Su Bingwen has already signed a contract with Russia to purchase military equipment and supplies, etc., and is preparing to invade Manchuria in one fell swoop during the thawing season. His subordinates are scattered in various directions such as North Tomsk, Irkutsk, Khabarovsk, and Ussuriysk. There are 40 non-commissioned officers currently waiting for an opportunity. On the 2nd of this month, they secretly went to Shanghai from Vladivostok to discuss the offensive plan. On the one hand, a large number of secret agents were sent, disguised as fur merchants, to promote anti-Manchu and anti-Japanese work along the Chinese Eastern Railway. At the same time, Russia has been continuously increasing its troops on the Russian-Manchu border. Russia's anti-Japanese attitude has been clearly exposed. The development of the situation in the future is truly worthy of attention.</p>

<p>Produced by the Southwest Political Affairs Committee, it is assumed that the provincial governors are the members.</p>
<p>Guangzhou correspondence: Since Huang Shao-xiong went south, he has been discussing foreign plans with various important figures. Initially, it was planned to organize a Volunteer Army Committee, but because the name of the Volunteer Army was too narrow, it was specially changed to the Southwest National Defense Council. The word "national defense" can include both anti-Japanese and communist suppression. As for the formation of the National Defense Council, it was passed at a temporary meeting convened by the Southwest Political Affairs Committee on the morning of the 2nd. Those present on the day were Deng Zeru, Zou Lu, Lin Zhimian, Lin Yizhong, Deng Qingyang, Ou Fangpu, Liu Jiwen, Liu Luyin, Luo Yiqun, Zhang Renmin, Li Xiaosheng, Lin Yunhai, Li Pan, Yang Xiji, Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, Chen Rong, etc. Those present as observers were Cai Tingkai and Bai Chongxi.

After the Political Affairs Committee passed the National Defense Council regulations, it immediately elected Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, Lin Yunhai, Jiang Guangnai, and Cai Tingkai as members of the National Defense Committee. All the members except Jiang Guang were inducted into office at 12:00 noon on the same day in the conference hall on the second floor of the Political Affairs Committee. Deng Zeru was appointed by the Political Affairs Committee to administer the oath. The ceremony was simple and lasted about 20 minutes.</p>

<h3 id="e61">Southern Leaders Mediate the Guizhou Situation <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Plans to Send Dan Maoxin to Guizhou, Both Mao and Wang Jun Willing to Accept Mediation</p>
<p>Guangzhou dispatch: The civil war in Guizhou Province has been unresolved for a long time. The troops of Wang Jialie, Mao Guangxiang, and You Guocai have advanced and retreated around Guiyang, the provincial capital, several times. On the 18th of last month, Wang's troops re-entered Guiyang, while the troops of Mao, You, and Jiang withdrew to Likou, Zunyi area, actively preparing for a counter-attack. Therefore, the situation in Guizhou remains extremely chaotic. As for the rumor of You Guocai's death in battle, the Cantonese side has not yet confirmed it. Huang Shaoxiong, Cai Tingkai, and Bai Chongxi came to Guangzhou to discuss the major plan of resisting Japan and suppressing the Communists. Because in this emergency of foreign invasion, the country should unite as one to resist foreign enemies and eliminate domestic Communists. Therefore, they are extremely concerned about the Guizhou war. Huang Shaoxiong has also consulted with various important figures on mediation methods. Recently, various important figures, together with the Southwest authorities, also held consultations with Yan Chongjie, Zhang Pengnian, Yang Qiufan, and other Guizhou natives residing in Guangdong, and formulated a plan to be telegraphed to Mao Guangxiang, Wang Jialie, You Guocai, etc., for their selection, to stop military actions within the province, and to urge the allocation of one division or two mixed brigades to participate in resisting Japan and suppressing the Communists, and to jointly face the national crisis. The draft of the mediation plan is as follows: 1. Each party should immediately cease military actions at its current location. 2. The exercise of political power should be considered in one of the following ways: A. Mao and Wang, the two leaders, should continue to cooperate as before, with Mao as the commander-in-chief and provincial chairman, and Wang as the military commander, and the remaining positions distributed to military officers; B. Mao and Wang retain their original military positions, while political power is given to the local people, and another capable person is recommended as the provincial chairman to organize a government suitable for the current situation; C. Mao, as the commander-in-chief, leads everything, while Wang and You are responsible for military and civilian affairs; D. A Guizhou political reorganization committee is established, with Mao, Wang, and You all serving as members, plus the recommendation of four or six people familiar with politics as members to jointly organize, with Mao or Wang as the chairman. 3. Publicize finances, clearly delineate military and civilian expenses, gradually reduce the army, and gradually expand the change of affairs. 4. Matters concerning the organization, garrison, and military needs of the army shall be decided by the military committee. 5. Send one division or two mixed brigades to participate in the work of resisting Japan and suppressing the Communists, with half of the military expenses borne by the province and the other half requested from the command organization. It is also heard that the Southwest authorities plan to send Dan Maoxin to Guizhou Province in the name of the Political Affairs Council within a few days to be responsible for mediation, and at a minimum, to stop the war in the province first. When Cai Tingkai was in Fujian, he telegraphed Mao and Wang to advise them to cease the dispute, but after the telegram was sent, he did not receive a reply from Guizhou. Now, taking advantage of the mediation, he will send another telegram in his personal name to mediate, hoping that they will adopt the mediation plan, send troops to suppress the Communists and resist Japan, and not sacrifice for internal strife, which would be hated by the people of the country. It is heard that Zhang Pengnian and other Guizhou natives residing in Guangdong also plan to return to Guizhou to assist in mediating everything.</p>
<p>As for Wang Jialie's re-entry into Guiyang, he has already expressed his willingness to accept the mediation of Guangdong and Guangxi. Therefore, he immediately sent Deng Shao Cheng, the director of the Department of Finance, as a representative to Guangdong to discuss the major plans of resisting Japan and uniting. After Deng was ordered, he and Yang Zhiqian and others arrived in Guangdong yesterday, and immediately went to the Southwest Political Committee and the headquarters of the First Army Group to report on the mission and the recent situation in Guizhou. It is also heard that Lu has recently telegraphed from Guizhou, saying that Mao and You are afraid of the futility of civil war and also have the intention of stopping the conflict and resisting insults. Therefore, it is predicted that if Guangdong and Guangxi are determined to mediate, the Guizhou issue can be resolved soon. (February 4th)</p>
<h3 id="e62">He Bandits Re-occupy Sangzhi <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>The massacre is even worse than before. Government troops are encircling and suppressing.</p>
<p>Changsha dispatch: The Red bandit He Long, whose ancestral home is in western Hunan, was originally a major bandit. In the 18th year of the Republic (1929), he led his bandit troops to attack and capture Sangzhi once, burning and massacring, extremely cruelly. Later, after being defeated by government troops, he retreated into western Hubei and united with the gangs of Duan Dechang and Kuang Jixun, becoming a major scourge on the border of Hunan and Hubei. Subsequently, after being suppressed by the large army, the bandit flames were slightly extinguished, but the remaining bandits still lurked on the border of Hunan and Hubei, seizing the opportunity to steal and launch attacks. Therefore, on January 8th, they once again fled from Hefeng in Hubei into Sangzhi in Hunan. The county is located on the extreme border, and government troops could not provide timely support. The county seat fell on the 12th. According to the telegram report from the officials, the situation of the massacre was even worse than in the 18th year of the Republic. When He's bandits invaded Sangbian, the defense army Zhu Jikai regiment made every effort to block and suppress them, but due to being outnumbered, they had to withdraw from Sangzhi to wait for reinforcements. Chen Quzhen, the commander of the New 34th Division, ordered the Zhou Xieqing brigade to rush to aid day and night. The Zhou brigade arrived at the border of Sangzhi on the 13th. The bandits had already resisted dangerously on the border of Sangzhi. However, at that time, it was a heavy snowstorm that sealed the mountains, and the roads were completely submerged in water and coolness, making it extremely difficult to use troops. In addition to skirmishes between sentries, they could only make every effort to contain and block their rush. On the 18th and 19th, the bandits suddenly destroyed several tens of feet of the road on the 300-step cliff and retreated. According to reconnaissance reports, the bandits in Sangcheng retreated towards Hongchenguan Nancha on the 20th. Brigade Commander Zhou immediately inquired from Cili and Yongshun by telephone and learned that there was a bandit division attacking Yongshun in three routes. Brigade Zhou changed his plan and moved his troops to rescue Yongshun, leaving some troops to take charge of the Dayong defense. Zhou himself moved to Yongshun on the 21st to join forces to suppress the bandits. On the 22nd, they came into contact with the bandits on the line of Nihu Pagoda in Sangzhi, and they fought fiercely for three days and nights. The bandits stubbornly resisted, and the Zhou brigade launched several assaults. The bandits could not hold out and began to collapse. The Zhou brigade immediately pursued and suppressed the bandits towards Sangzhi. Chen Quzhen has now appointed Brigade Commander Gong Renjie as the commander of the Communist suppression, and Zhou Xieqing as the deputy commander, responsible for supervising the suppression. During the Communist suppression, all the local defense teams in the counties near Sangzhi were under the command of Gong Zhou. Gong led his troops to Yongshun on the 24th to command the pursuit and suppression. Although He's bandits are cunning, it should not be difficult to quickly suppress them. As for the massacre of the bandits in Sangcheng this time, the Sangzhi county magistrate and the supervisor sent a report to the province, which is shocking. A special note is made below.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Telegram 1 <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Hu, the magistrate of Sangzhi, telegraphed from Yongshun, saying that according to reports from refugees who escaped from Sangcheng, He's bandits recently gave speeches in Sangzhi, arrested various public and private leaders, township and district chiefs, and gentry, and decided to skin them alive. Those who have more than 20 shi of people's livestock and grains will be overthrown. In recent days, they have arrested rich men and women near Sangcheng, pierced their ears, noses, and palms with iron chains, and sent them to Hongjiaguan, where they were tortured. The methods are ten times more cruel than when they fled to Sang last year. They also arrested farmers everywhere, forced them to join the Communists, and the people were terrified. No matter how poor their families were, they all fled abroad. If they are not severely suppressed in time, I am afraid that their power will expand and it will be difficult to manage, etc. It is found that the number of refugees escaping in recent days has been increasing day by day, and they are suffering from wind and dew, and living like years. The counter-attack troops are limited by transportation, and it takes time to concentrate. The county magistrate and agricultural relief staff have been borrowing from all sides for days, and there is no way to help. In addition to telegraphing Chen's division commander to quickly issue an attack order, in order to recover the city as soon as possible, I would like to send another telegram to your Excellency, immediately issue emergency relief, to benefit the disaster victims, and to avoid the use of starvation. The telegram is extremely urgent.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Telegram 2 <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>The supervisor of Sangzhi County telegraphed, saying that Communist leader He Long led more than 10,000 bandits into Sang territory. On the 10th, County Magistrate Hu left the city in the middle of the night, and the entire county fell into a state of anarchy. On the 12th, the defense army was outnumbered, and the county seat fell. The county government and local agencies were destroyed without exception. The residences of public officials were looted. The disaster was more tragic than in the 18th year of the Republic. Those who escaped supported the old and carried the young in the ice and snow, crying for hunger and cold. Those who did not escape had their noses pierced, ears cut, limbs broken, and chests pierced, extremely painfully. I sincerely ask your Excellency to allow me to forward the report to the provincial government, telegraph the defense army to recover the county seat on a specific date, and write to the provincial relief committee to quickly issue emergency relief to the extreme disaster victims. The telegram is urgent and I am deeply apprehensive.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Anhui Shuidong Coal Mine Changed to Commercial Operation <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>The provincial government decided that the Department of Construction and the contractor should sign a contract for the total price.</p>
<p>Anqing dispatch: The Shuidong Coal Mine in Xuan City, southern Anhui, was established in the 13th year of the Republic (1924). It was a government-run mine under the supervision office, one of the three government-run mines in Anhui Province. However, since it was run by the government, it has failed to develop. The official funds raised by the supervision office are limited, and funds are insufficient. Therefore, mining bonds were issued, and commercial shares were added. In the 15th year, military events occurred, and operations were suspended. In the 16th year, Wang Da was appointed as the general manager by the Anhui Political Affairs Committee. In the 17th year, the Anhui Mining Bureau reviewed and approved seven cleaning methods and submitted them for approval to organize a cleaning committee, but it failed to clean up effectively, and mining became more difficult. In the 18th year, the Department of Construction drafted a reorganization plan and submitted it to the provincial government for approval. All the government-run mines owed commercial debts, totaling more than one million yuan, which was converted into 400,000 yuan. The government-run mining bureau exchanged interest-bearing bonds, which were handed over to Wang Da, the handler, to be responsible for repayment. In the same year, the Department of Construction took over the government-run mining bureau directly under its jurisdiction, and repeatedly allocated treasury funds and iron sand donations. By December of the 20th year, including the expenses of the government-run mining bureau, the total amount was 284,590.47 yuan. Only because the directors of the bureau in the past were poorly managed, various projects were badly damaged. All the four-shaft vertical shaft and two large alleys below the coal mine were submerged and collapsed by water. Expansion projects were never carried out. The insurance coal pillars of the winding road in the inclined shaft were all dug up and damaged, and coal production was suspended. From the minerals to the Zhi Qiao light railway bridges, sleepers, locomotives, and vehicles, all have been damaged, and income has been sharply reduced, making it impossible to maintain. Last year, Cheng Zhenjun, the director of the Department of Construction, allocated funds to plan for reorganization and restoration. Liu Yiyan, the successor director of the Department of Construction, also repeatedly allocated iron sand donations and borrowed funds totaling more than 30,000 yuan, and handed them over to the bureau to strive for reorganization, but none of them succeeded. Therefore, he developed two fundamental relief methods: one is for the government to thoroughly reorganize itself, that is, to open new wells, add equipment to deepen the project into the stratum, and open up a large amount of mineral resources, and to repair the light railway and add locomotives and vehicles to facilitate transportation and speed up sales, which is estimated to cost 300,000 yuan; the other is to follow the example of the Mantoushan mine factory to recruit merchants to contract the mine, so that the original business of the mine can be continued by the merchants and other developments can be sought, and the public can also recover the advance funds and operate other production enterprises to avoid wasting expenses. Even the previously owed commercial debts can be used to end the business. It happened that mineral merchants Yu Zhimin and others were willing to take over the mine. The Department of Construction drafted a draft principle and submitted it to the provincial government's standing committee for discussion. The meeting decided to hand it over for review, and then decided that all assets and mining rights of the Shuidong Coal Mine should be transferred to the merchants for contracting, according to the draft principle decided by the Department of Construction and the contracting merchants, as follows: 1. The total price is 700,000 yuan in national currency. 2. In addition to the 400,000 yuan of commercial debts that should be repaid, the method of paying the 300,000 yuan of public funds should be negotiated with Wang Da, the representative. The remaining funds should be paid off in 20 years, and the method of payment should be determined separately. 3. The Department of Construction should negotiate with the contractor to increase the prepaid price. It is also heard that all the prepaid prices have been negotiated by the Department of Construction with the contractor, and the amount has been increased to 50,000 yuan. In accordance with the resolution, a contract was drafted, but because it involved the disposal of provincial property, it was specially submitted to the provincial government's standing committee meeting for three days and decided to pass the review case.

<p>(Nanjing) The Anti-Japanese Association received a report that treacherous merchants Lu Hangsen and Shen Jusheng were transporting a large amount of rapeseed from Wu to Japan for sale, and that the ship was about to pass through Beijing. The inspectors of the association found the rapeseed, more than 1,300 bags, after the Jiangshun ship arrived at the port, and stored them in the warehouse. They also detained Yang Jichang, Yin Zheng Song Qian Shulin who escorted the goods, on the grounds that they had transported more than 3,000 bags to Shanghai and stored them in the Yihua warehouse, waiting for the ship to export. The association immediately telegraphed the Shanghai Anti-Japanese Association to set up a detention, and sent the three people to the Garrison Headquarters, and sent personnel to Shanghai to investigate and verify the facts. The association decided to fine the treacherous merchants from 2,000 to 5,000 yuan, and ordered them to guarantee that they would never sell goods to the enemy country. The treacherous merchants made many requests, voluntarily fined 2,000 yuan and guaranteed that they would never sell goods to the enemy country again, and requested the release of the detained rapeseed and the detained three people. The association approved the request and ordered the fine to be sent to the association on the 8th, and the detained rapeseed was also returned in full. At the same time, it also sent a letter to the Garrison Department to release the three detained people. (Eighth Special Telegram)</p>

<p>British and American Discussion of Lump-Sum Repayment Plan</p>
<p>National 7th Washington telegram, it is heard that London is discussing the war debts and paying a lump sum as a repayment plan. Today, the opinions of American congressmen were sought, and a majority expressed their support for this. However, there are very few supporters for the amount that has been reported by foreign telegrams or can be used as the basis for resolving British debt. According to London telecommunications, the opinions vary, ranging from 100 million pounds to 200 million pounds. However, most American congressmen believe that it is too little. Only a few people are studying the effect of solving British debt with 100 million US dollars as the basis. American congressmen consider the British proposal, mostly Republicans. According to a congressman, most Democratic congressmen, including Ray Ney, chairman of the House Program Committee, still believe that reducing tariffs will enable debtor countries to repay their debts, and this move will bring more permanent benefits to debtor countries than reducing debt. He also said that this method is in line with Roosevelt's proposal during the election campaign. As for the World Economic Conference, Congress does not seem to pay as much attention to it as before. Although people in the US government claim that this meeting must be convened after a method of resolving war debts is obtained, the US financial community does not seem to be as enthusiastic about it as the political community. Most financial papers say that if problems such as high protective taxes, preferential taxes, and import quotas are not discussed, this conference may not have any effect on restoring world prosperity. In addition, the New York Financial Chronicle is most familiar with international issues. It is said that today, the United States has become the only country unwilling to postpone the economic conference.</p>

<p>National 8th Geneva telegram, the General Committee of the Military Disarmament Conference will continue to debate the French elect-shrinkage security plan today. The debate has now reached the point of close combat. There is much speculation about the speech that French Foreign Minister Peng Gu will deliver today. Almost all members oppose the French plan, so it is expected that Peng Gu would rather cancel the plan than make any concessions, because concessions will not be tolerated by French public opinion. It is said that Peng Gu will take a stronger attitude, and if so, the situation will become more complicated.</p>
<p>National 7th Geneva telegram, today the representatives of Yugoslavia, Hungary, the Netherlands, Romania, and Norway all stated their opinions on the French plan at the General Committee of the Military Disarmament Conference.

The Hungarian representative welcomed France's recognition of the principle that all countries share equal rights regarding disarmament, but also agreed with other representatives' comments on the French plan. The Norwegian representative said that before creating international troops, there must be a true international spirit, but at present, this spirit has not yet been produced. Furthermore, if this meeting does not want to fail completely, it must make a final effort with the determination to fight to the death in order to achieve its goal.</p>

<p>Reuters, Paris, 7th – The Daladier government is in danger of failing, which is quite unexpected, as the National Union of State Services Personnel has today unanimously resolved to oppose the new financial proposals. The union has declared the determination of officials to refuse any sacrifices and has asked members to prepare for any necessary action. It is widely believed that the union's resolution will lead the Socialist Party to oppose the new government.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 7th – To avoid repeating the fate of former Finance Minister Chéron, the French government has submitted its financial proposals, which aim to cut government spending by 2,500,000,000 francs. However, they place only a very light burden on officials, with retirees being particularly unaffected. Military spending will be cut by 638,000,000 francs. The new proposals suggest increasing taxes on alcohol, gasoline, and automobiles, as well as imposing a tax on import licenses for goods subject to quota restrictions. The new proposals also stipulate that taxpayers must fill in the names of their banks on their income tax returns, so that their securities can be checked. It is expected that this measure will increase income tax revenue by 100,000,000 francs.</p>

<p>Havas, Paris, 7th – The Finance Committee of the Chamber of Deputies met, and Finance Minister Lamoureux explained that the government intends to consolidate public finances in three steps. The first step is the government's current proposal. The second step involves supplemental measures to seek new revenue, to be proposed in a future financial bill. In addition, there is a deficit of approximately 5 billion francs, which is planned to be covered by using public debt funds for a period of one year. In the third step, the government will consolidate public debt to reduce the burden on the treasury, but this can only succeed if savers have confidence in the government. Budget Minister Palley declared that, including all proposed measures up to the end of the month, the budget deficit will reach 6.4 billion francs. However, since the maximum limit for treasury bill issuance has been raised to 5 billion francs, the treasury's needs can still be met, but caution is necessary.</p>

<p>The British warship is named HMS Aphis and is commanded by Captain Cox. It sailed from Hankou to the provincial capital on September 8th of last year and is anchored off the coast. The ship has a total of over sixty British soldiers and employs twenty-four Chinese workers. According to regulations, Chinese workers are not allowed near the gunnery hold and the deck. The lost cannon, called Lewis, was originally mounted in an iron box on the three-story deck. Armed British soldiers were stationed on the deck for surveillance. Nothing unusual was observed on the afternoon of the 25th. On the morning of the 26th, the British soldier on duty discovered that the cannon was missing. At the same time, a box of ammunition was also lost.

I immediately went to the ship with Chen, a patrol officer from the Sixth Police Station of the land-water continent, to investigate the situation. It was reported that the serial number of the lost gun was 544, and a box of Lewis ammunition was also lost, containing ten cakes, each with forty-seven rounds, as well as seventeen rows of .65 caliber bullets.

Unexpectedly, the HMS Aphis lost its cannon that evening, leading to many suspicions. Later, the HMS Aphis handed over the lost cannon case to the British consulate for handling. It weighed anchor and prepared to sail to Hankou at 8:30 AM on the 28th. However, due to the dry winter and low water levels, and being unfamiliar with the waterway, it ran aground in the XinKang River. It cannot be moved until the spring floods arrive. The British warship is truly plagued by troubles. (February 1st)</p>
<h3 id="e103">Special Products from Northern Anhui Shipped Sequentially <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>More Than Ten Counties Have Started; Special Products Inspection Station Established in Bengbu</p>
<p>Bengbu News – The Bengbu Special Products Collection and Transportation Office has been in operation for nearly two months. The collection and transportation area under its jurisdiction includes 21 counties in northern Anhui and 9 counties in central Anhui, totaling 30 counties. The collection and transportation period was originally limited to three months. However, due to the fact that three months may not be enough to complete the task, it is said that the collection quota for the 30 counties is set at 600,000 yuan. However, given the current situation of poverty among the people, it is doubtful whether the quota can be fully collected. Furthermore, due to the strict regulations of the office, each county's quota is too large, and the collection and transportation personnel must pay a deposit in advance and find a reliable shop as guarantor. Therefore, most people seeking collection and transportation jobs are taking a wait-and-see attitude, as there is a risk of compensation. It is reported that more than a month after the opening of the Special Products Collection and Transportation Office, only several thousand yuan in deposits have been collected. Commissioner Feng Yafo was quite anxious at first, but later decided to order all counties to start operations on February 1st, regardless of the circumstances. However, only ten or so counties have complied with the order. The collection and transportation personnel assigned to the remaining counties have been unable to travel as scheduled due to various procedures such as finding a guarantor and paying fees. Furthermore, Feng Yafo recently stated that many hotels, brothels, and opium dens in Bengbu City have a large amount of special products stored that have not been registered, and it is necessary to strictly crack down on them. Therefore, it was decided to establish an inspection station in Bengbu, appointing Li Rihui, a consultant of the office, as the director. After accepting the appointment, Li found a location in the Tongshang Apartment on Huachang Street and took office on the 6th, starting to work. The station has two departments: general affairs and inspection, and more than ten inspectors. Feng Yafo also issued a notice ordering people storing special products to report and register at the inspection station within three days from the 6th. However, given the strict attitude of the military and police authorities towards the prohibition of opium, whether people storing special products who register at the inspection station (paying an inspection fee of 30 cents per tael) and obtain an inspection certificate can have adequate protection from military and police inspections and arrests is a major question.

<h3 id="e104">Yellow River Management in Shandong Province <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Surveying and Repairing the Estuary, Adding and Repairing Stone Embankments, Preparing for Flood Control</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence – The Yellow River has been a disaster for thousands of years, and Shandong, being located downstream, has suffered the most. Last autumn, the Ministry of Interior sent Wang Yingyu to Shandong to inspect the Yellow River with Pan Yifen, the Chief Engineer of the Shandong River Affairs Bureau, and Zhang Hanying, the President of the Jinan Branch of the Chinese Engineering Society. As a result, they believed that the most important thing for managing the Yellow River was to dredge the downstream estuary and add and repair stone embankments. Because the estuary is silted up, the discharge is not smooth, which leads to breaches. Where there are stone embankments, the water cannot erode them, so there have never been breaches. However, the project is huge, and due to financial constraints, it can only be done step by step. It is said that regarding dredging the estuary, the River Affairs Bureau plans to send personnel to conduct a preliminary survey and measurement after the spring warmth in order to design a plan. As for adding and repairing stone embankments, the province has already had two years of success. The method is to save other expenses, actively purchase stone materials, and it is estimated that in another two years, all the famous dangerous projects within the province can be completely converted from earth dikes to stone embankments. Then, even if there are major floods in summer and autumn, there will be no more breaches. However, ice floes are unpredictable. Ice floes are different from major floods in summer and autumn. Often, large ice floes dozens of feet across crash down from the upper reaches, and even giant trees dozens of feet in circumference will fall when hit. Ships are shattered when hit, and earth dikes and levees are even more easily destroyed. In addition, the weather is cold and the water is icy, so flood control personnel cannot enter the water and dare not approach. In the old rules of the Qing Dynasty, river workers were not punished for breaches caused by ice floes, which is the reason for this. This year, the weather is unusually cold. Around the Lunar New Year, the temperature in the province was often below 17 or 18 degrees Celsius, which has not been seen in decades. Therefore, the Yellow River has frozen thicker than in previous years. It is now after the Beginning of Spring, and large carts carrying thousands of pounds can still travel on the ice, so the thickness of the river ice can be imagined. Once the east wind thaws, the amount of river water and the force of the current will also be several times greater than in previous years. The River Affairs Bureau has already reinforced the secondary embankments and prepared water排 (bamboo rafts or barriers) to prepare for flood control. Although they are trying their best, they are not very confident. According to people at the River Affairs Bureau, the most terrible thing is that the weather is often cold and warm, and the ice may freeze and thaw at times, or the ice may thaw in the upper reaches and large ice floes crash down, while the lower reaches near the sea are still very cold and the ice has not yet thawed, which will block the ice and water from the upper reaches, causing it to crash in all directions, often leading to breaches.

<p>Cheng Jin'gen, a resident of Village 56, Changqiao Township, Xinzhuang, Songjiang, is a carpenter. He runs a workshop at home and hires many workers to help with the work. Yesterday (the 7th), Yu Gengsheng, a worker who had quit, came from Qibao to ask Cheng for his remaining belongings. Cheng withheld them because of outstanding debts. Yu became angry and picked up an axe nearby, hacking at Cheng Jin'gen's back. The chop only broke his clothing. Yu then chopped at Cheng's chest but still did not cause injury. The worker then aimed a chop at Cheng's forehead. Cheng could not dodge in time and was struck, causing blood to flow all over the ground. Cheng was horrified and called another worker, Lu A'gou, for help. Lu helped to restrain the attacker, Yu Gengsheng, and hand him over to the police station to be transferred to the prosecutor's office for punishment.</p>

Furthermore, due to the severe cold and snow last month, garbage has accumulated in various streets and alleys of the city, making them filthy and difficult to walk. The city's sanitation expenses are limited, and the cleaners are mostly old and weak, making it difficult to clean. It was also decided at the Public Security Bureau's office meeting to place the sanitation police of each branch bureau in the urban area under the command of the Second Section of the Public Security Bureau to centralize authority. From today onwards, laborers will be dispatched to carry out street cleaning to improve sanitation and the appearance of the city.</p>

<p>Previously, there were only telegrams between Wuxi and Jiangyin. After the January 28th Shanghai Incident last year, the authorities installed temporary long-distance telephones to facilitate military use, considering Jiangyin as the gateway to the Yangtze River.

It is recently reported that the Xicheng telegraph offices have been ordered to install a pair of Xicheng long-distance telephone lines on the existing telegraph poles for business purposes. The two bureaus have already complied with the order.</p>

<p>He Zhuguo Telegraphs – He Zhuguo's telegram to the Support Association reads: (Titles Omitted) Eastern Telegraph Received. I am deeply grateful for your kindness in collecting funds to make winter clothing to care for the soldiers. However, the New Year is approaching, and it will take time to make leather vests, which will soon be needed with the approach of spring. It would be more practical to make a portion of shoes and socks and purchase heavy-duty vehicles. I request that you consider and handle this matter. He Zhuguo Kows, Branch (Telegraph Omitted)</p>

<h3 id="e120">Implementation of the Abolish-Tael, Replace-with-Dollar Decision on March 1st <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Weight: 7 mace 2 candareens; Fineness: .888</p>
<p>Officially Set Dollar Value: 7 mace 1 candareen 5 cash</p>
<p>The Mint to Simultaneously Begin Minting New Currency</p>
<p>Regarding the abolition of the tael and its replacement with the dollar, the Ministry of Finance convened a meeting of silver trade associations and expert committees on July 25th of last year to conduct research. However, due to unresolved issues such as the weight and fineness of the new currency, the matter was delayed. Recently, Minister Song met again with leaders of the silver and money industries. According to inquiries by a reporter from the New Voice Press, it has been decided to implement the change on March 1st. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Weight and Fineness Determined: Minister of Finance Song Ziwen, in Shanghai, recently met again with leaders of the silver and money industries, believing that the abolition of the tael and its replacement with the dollar is a crucial step. Agreement was reached, and the weight and fineness of the new currency were determined, based on the principles of the Currency Regulations of the Third Year of the Republic. The weight will be 7 mace 2 candareens, equivalent to 23.9779048 grams, and the fineness will be .888.</p>
<p>Officially Set Dollar Value: Transactions in various industries are currently mostly calculated in silver taels. After the implementation of the abolish-tael, replace-with-dollar policy, it will be necessary to convert to silver dollars. If there is no specific method prescribed, difficulties will inevitably arise. The Ministry of Finance has now decided to set the official dollar value at 7 mace 1 candareen 5 cash per dollar. After implementation, all conversions between silver taels and silver dollars in various industries will be based on the officially set dollar value, thus avoiding conversion difficulties.</p>
<p>Implementation on the First of Next Month: As for the implementation date of the abolish-tael, replace-with-dollar policy, the Ministry of Finance has decided to implement it on March 1st of this year and will order all subordinate agencies to comply. However, as of last night, the local chamber of commerce and the trade associations of the silver and money industries had not yet received the ministerial order.</p>
<p>Free Minting of Silver Dollars: Since Director Guo improved the minting machinery at the Central Mint, the abolition of the tael and its replacement with the dollar will be implemented on March 1st. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance has decided to begin minting concurrently and to allow the free minting of silver dollars. That is, various industries can entrust the mint with the refining and minting of silver ingots. In the future, all silver dollars minted will feature the image of Sun Yat-sen and be new currency.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Money Industry Adopts Dollar Standard <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Preliminary Measures to Be Implemented at the Beginning of the Month</p>
<p>Since the government officially promulgated the system of abolishing taels and using dollars, there have been repeated delays due to various inconveniences in commercial practices. Money shops, in order to adapt to the trend, have discussed the matter several times. Now, knowing that further delays are difficult, on the occasion of the traditional sacrificial rites to the industry's ancestors, leaders of the money industry gathered in the Yimiao Inner Garden. There, Runqing proposed that since the industry's exchange rate had already switched to the dollar standard, there was no need for daily fluctuations. A standard exchange rate should be set so that there would be a basis for silver-dollar exchanges. Furthermore, the appropriate steps to take after the abolition of the "foreign cash" should be determined. Discussion began immediately, and as a result, the following temporary measures were decided, to be implemented after being approved by a general assembly: 1. The standard cash price will be set at 7 mace 1 candareen 5 cash as a permanent dollar cash price. 2. Silver will be exchanged for dollars at a rate of 1 dollar and 40 cents per tael. 3. The exchange rate for subsidiary currency, which has previously been based on silver, will also be calculated using the dollar system from the date of implementation. 4. A dollar exchange market will be added, to be implemented from March 1st. The reporter notes that calculations based on items one and two show that when converting dollars to silver, 1,000 dollars in silver will only yield 1,398 dollars and 60 cents, which is 1 dollar and 40 cents less than the standard rate. When converting silver to dollars, 1,400 dollars can yield 1,001 taels of silver, which is 1 tael more than the standard rate per 1,000. For various industries, the small difference in commission is not a significant loss, while the financial sector will see no gain or loss. As for the conversion of subsidiary currency to the dollar system, let us provide an explanation. For example, if the current exchange rate is 6 mace for every 10 cents, then under the dollar system, it will be 84 cents of national currency. Increases or decreases in the exchange rate will be based on this standard. The same applies to copper coins. For example, if the exchange rate is 420 cash per thousand, then under the dollar system, it will be 300 cash (i.e., the standard for every 100 taels of silver or 100 dollars). This is the same as the exchange rates posted in the market, where every dollar is exchanged for 3,000 cash. Increases or decreases in the exchange rate will also be based on this standard. As for the issue of currency unification, it is feared that a decision cannot be made hastily. It will probably require some time after these measures have been implemented effectively and without unexpected disputes before it can be discussed.</p>

<p>International Labour Conference in Geneva, International Chamber of Commerce in Vienna</p>
<p>丨China Is Preparing to Send Representatives Separately丨</p>
<p>In May of this year, there will be two important international conferences on industry and commerce: the 17th International Labour Conference and the 7th International Chamber of Commerce Congress. The reporter of the Guowen News Agency has learned about the recent preparations being made by the Chinese side for the two conferences, which are summarized below:</p>
<h3 id="e123">International Labour Conference <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Ministry of Industry Notifies National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and China Industrial Associations: Yesterday, the Ministry of Industry issued a notice stating that the 17th Conference will be held in Geneva on May 13th of this year, and requesting the immediate dispatch of two employer representatives and advisors to attend. The original text reads as follows: "Regarding the notification, the Foreign Ministry's document No. 9097 states that the representative office of the League of Nations has submitted a notice from the Director of the International Labour Office regarding the convening of the 17th Conference. It also states that the office requests to be informed of our country's attending advisors and any proposals as soon as possible, with reference to the conclusions of the report of the 16th Conference, for onward transmission, etc. A copy of the Labour Office's notice is enclosed for your ministry's reference and handling in accordance with past precedents and a response is requested for onward transmission, etc. An enclosed copy of the notice is sent to your ministry. The method for dispatching representatives and advisors to attend the conference is currently being proposed by the Ministry, to be submitted to the administrative meeting. The method for dispatching employer representatives and advisors will still follow the previous example, jointly proposed by the China Industrial Associations and the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, and submitted to the government for approval. As the conference is approaching, the selection of these representatives and advisors is urgently needed. In addition to separate notifications, the original notice is hereby copied and sent to the Associations, requesting compliance and the immediate submission of the names of the personnel to the Ministry for submission to the government for approval. This notice is hereby given."</p>
<p>Preparing to Send Representatives: After receiving the order, the two associations immediately consulted on the selection of representatives and advisors to attend the conference, and the Industrial Associations raised funds for overseas expenses. It is learned that it has been proposed to nominate Yan Qingxiang, manager of Suzhou Sulun Yarn Factory and Hoolung Iron Works, as the employer representative. It is noted that Mr. Yan is the eldest son of the yarn factory magnate Yan Yutang, and is highly knowledgeable and capable. His appointment as representative is considered highly appropriate. As for the employer advisor, He Tingzhen, currently serving as a juror at the International Court in Geneva, is internally designated to serve. It is heard that the travel expenses for the two are set at 15,000 yuan, and they are scheduled to depart for Europe in early April.</p>
<h3 id="e124">International Chamber of Commerce Congress <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Conference Date This Year: The 7th International Chamber of Commerce Congress will also be held on May 28th of this year. The venue will be in Vienna, the capital of Austria. The China Branch of the International Chamber of Commerce has received notification from the Geneva headquarters to send representatives to attend.</p>
<p>Internally Designated Representatives: The China Branch of the International Chamber of Commerce, organized by the Chinese side, is located at No. 4 Hong Kong Road. The president is Chen Guangfu, and the vice president is Guo Bingwen. To facilitate contact, Lin Kanghou has been invited to serve as the secretary-general of the association, managing its affairs. For this congress, our country will naturally send several representatives and expert committee members to attend. It is heard that the representatives will still be Guo Bingwen and several others. It is also faintly heard that Lin Kanghou may also accompany them, as he is the chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and is well-versed in the domestic commercial situation. Various sectors greatly hope that Mr. Lin can make a trip to Europe.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Fire Destroys Trains at Zhabei Station <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Three Passenger Cars Completely Destroyed, Others Damaged and Repairable; Losses Around 100,000; Cause of Fire Unknown</p>
<p>At 4:40 AM yesterday morning, a fire broke out in the Zhabei Station of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway. Two empty passenger trains, each with more than ten empty passenger cars attached, were parked on Tracks 5 and 6 of the station. Unexpectedly, a first-class passenger car attached to the empty passenger train parked on Track 5 suddenly caught fire, and the flames quickly spread to the other passenger cars and the empty passenger train parked on Track 6. The wind was strong, and the fire burned until 6:00 AM, when it was finally extinguished. As a result, a first-class passenger car, a first- and second-class passenger car, and a third-class passenger car on Track 6 were completely destroyed, including their undercarriages. The estimated loss is around 100,000 yuan. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Passenger Cars Parked: On the night of the incident, one empty passenger train, consisting of ten first-, second-, third-, and fourth-class passenger cars, was parked on Track 6 of Hangzhou Zhabei Station. This was the No. 38 express train from Shanghai North Station to Hangzhou, which usually departed at 4:10 PM and was parked overnight at Zhabei Station, ready to be used for the No. 37 express train from Hangzhou to Shanghai, which departed at 1:40 PM the next afternoon. Also, around midnight on the same night, another empty passenger train, consisting of twelve first-, second-, and third-class passenger cars, was parked on Track 5 of the station. This was the No. 32 special night express train from Nanjing to Hangzhou, which departed at 10:00 AM, but was delayed on the way that day, so it arrived at Zhabei Station at around 2:00 AM at night. After all the passengers disembarked, the driver shunted the empty passenger train and parked it on Track 5 overnight, ready to be used for the No. 33 special night express train to Shanghai, which departed at 6:35 AM the next morning.</p>
<p>Sudden Fire: Unfortunately, the disaster occurred on this train. After the driver of the No. 32 night express train from the capital shunted and parked the empty passenger train on Track 5 of the station, the first-class passenger car attached to the train suddenly caught fire at 4:40 AM the next morning. The flames spread rapidly, and the fire was fierce, with red light filling the sky. Because it was late at night, the station's traffic and mechanical staff, as well as the railway police, tried their best to put out the fire. However, the fire was too fierce and could not be extinguished easily. At that time, various fire brigades from Hangzhou heard the alarm and rushed to help put out the fire. It was not until 6:00 AM that the fire was completely extinguished.</p>
<p>Cause Unknown: The cause of the fire is still unknown. It is reported that the first-class passenger car that caught fire was equipped with electric lights, a meter, and hot water pipes. Therefore, it is speculated that the fire was caused by an electrical short circuit, the bursting of a hot water pipe, or someone leaving a cigarette butt. The exact cause of the fire is still unknown.</p>
<p>Destruction and Investigation: As a result of the fire, one first-class passenger car No. 203 (the passenger car that caught fire on the Shanghai-Nanjing line) and one first- and second-class passenger car No. 208 parked on Track 5, and one third-class passenger car No. 151 of the No. 38 empty passenger train parked on Track 6, were completely destroyed, including their car bodies and undercarriages. In addition, one other fourth-class passenger car and the roofs and windows of three adjacent passenger cars were also affected and damaged, but can still be repaired and used. The internal mechanical parts of the engine of the No. 32 train were also damaged. The estimated loss from the disaster is around 100,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Chinese and Foreign Property Owners' Representatives Intervene with the Municipal Council Yesterday</p>
<p>Public Utilities Committee Currently Drafting New Water Price List</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the British-owned water company's installation of master meters has caused water rates to skyrocket, causing anxiety among residents throughout the city. Recently, the company has continued to use water cutoffs as a threat, leading tenants to resort to force in response. Yesterday, conflicts broke out in East Shanghai due to water cutoffs. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e129">Water Cutoff Conflicts <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>At around 10:00 AM yesterday, foreigners and Chinese workers sent by the water company to Shuncheng Lane on Zhoujiapai Road in East Shanghai suddenly went to the lane for the second time to cut off the water. Upon hearing the news, all the tenants, believing that the water rate case was still being mediated by the Municipal Council and that water cutoffs should absolutely not be carried out at this time, came out to dissuade them in self-defense. Unexpectedly, the foreigners acted violently without asking about the situation. The crowd present, feeling indignant at the foreigners' unreasonable behavior, were greatly displeased. Seeing that the situation was not good, the foreigners turned around and left.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Separate Petitions <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Afterwards, all the tenants in the lane, in order to seek assistance from all sectors, sent a representative, Wu Wenyuan, to the Property Owners' Association and the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, requesting them to relay to the Municipal Council and strictly prevent the water company from cutting off the water, which is essential for residents' drinking water.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Intervention Last Night <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>According to a telegram from the Property Owners' Association, Dou Yaoting, a representative of the association, went to the Municipal Council at 6:00 PM last night with Sparks and Presdeng, the chairman and vice-chairman of the Foreign Property Owners' Association, to meet with Director Eckerstein. They requested that the Municipal Council stop the water company's illegal actions. They left after talking for half an hour.</p>

<p>According to foreign sources yesterday, the water price issue discussed by the Public Utilities Committee of the Municipal Council on Tuesday this week has resulted in the agreement of a new water price list. However, the content does not seem to benefit users. Details will be further investigated.</p>

<p>Although the water case is still under discussion, the water company continues to cut off water. There were as many as four locations cut off yesterday, as recorded below: 1. Shunchi Lane on Kunming Road and Jingzhou Road, water cut off at 4:30 PM on February 7th. Yuanfu Lane on Tangshan Road and Baoding Road, water cut off at 11:00 AM on February 7th. Shuncheng Lane on Zhoujiapai Road in Yangshupu, water cut off at 10:30 AM on February 8th. 2. Qinyu Lane on Linqing Road in Yangshupu, water cut off at 11:00 AM on February 7th. At 3:00 PM, the tenants turned on the water themselves, but it was turned off again at 3:00 AM on the 8th. 3. Jingyu Lane on Tangshan Road, water cut off at 11:00 AM on February 7th. 4. Jingsheng Lane on Dongyouheng Road, water cut off at 11:00 AM on February 8th.</p>

<p>The "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury" stated that it was heard that the Public Utilities Committee of the Municipal Council held a meeting on Monday to discuss the water rate dispute. Its attitude towards the Shanghai Property Owners' Association's opposition to water cutoffs in various places has not been disclosed. It is heard that the resolution of the Public Utilities Committee will probably be submitted to the Municipal Council, and it is unlikely to announce its resolution of the dispute before it is submitted.</p>

<p>Sending Personnel to Investigate: Director Huang of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Administration, upon receiving a report of the disaster, immediately dispatched Zheng Baozhao, director of the traffic department of the two railways, and Desford (a Westerner), director of the engineering department, and personnel from the mechanical department to Zhabei at 7:35 AM yesterday on the No. 36 early express train to investigate the details of the disaster and report to the authorities for verification. It is also heard that the relevant personnel from the station will be summoned to the bureau for questioning today.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Qu Wenliu Reports on the Suffering of Refugees in Northeast China <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Qu Wenliu, the representative of the Shanghai United Association of Various Charitable Organizations for Relief of Northeastern Refugees, composed of nine charitable groups, who went north to investigate the situation, reported on the suffering of refugees in Northeast China at the Jiangxi Road Amei Broadcasting Station at 4:00 PM yesterday. He stated that this time, he was entrusted by the Shanghai Red Cross Society, the Chinese and Foreign Joint Relief Society, the Chinese Jisheng Society, the Lianyi Charity Association, the Huisheng Society, the Moral General Society, the Red Swastika Society, the Pushan Villa Xinwei Relief Society, and other nine charitable organizations to go north with Feng Yangshan, Wang Peiyuan, and others to organize relief for the Northeastern refugees. He went directly to Harbin once and to Qinhuangdao once, and investigated the situation in the war zones of Kailu, Xiawa, Suidong, Suizhong, and Lingyuan counties several times. Relief efforts are currently being actively carried out, and the amount of relief funds already released and being released exceeds 200,000 yuan. The trip to Harbin was made via the Beijing-Shenyang Railway directly to Liaoning, transferring to the South Manchuria Railway, passing through Changchun, and being subjected to surveillance and expulsion many times. The trip to Qinhuangdao involved working along the coast in icy and snowy conditions. As for Kailu, Xiawa, Suidong, Suizhong, and other places, trenches were dug and houses were torn down. The war situation can be described as being beyond human tolerance. Now that the war has been prolonged and the war zone has been expanded, the refugees between Shihe and Linyu mostly fled to Jinzhou, some to Beitianzhong, and some to Fangfu, Ningli, and Changli. Those who remained in Qinhuangdao were only in the dozens of villages nearby. From Kailu and Xiawa directly to Lengkou and Shihe, Japanese planes came to bomb from time to time. Remote villages and sparsely populated areas are far from the city, and no one goes to rescue them, and there is nowhere to escape. It can be said that there is no way to go to heaven and no door to enter the earth. The association's relief funds are limited and cannot provide full relief. It is hoped that all sectors will provide assistance.</p>

<p>The Executive Yuan Has Ordered the Two Ministries to Investigate and Handle</p>
<p>The China National Road Construction Association previously invited all sectors to visit the newly built embankments in Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Henan, and Shandong provinces by the National Government Flood Relief Committee. The association sent Wu Shan, a leading member, to participate in the inspection. After returning to Shanghai, he reported his findings to the executive committee, which decided to submit a request to the Executive Yuan to order the implementation of military engineering on the river embankments to convert them into highways to facilitate transportation. Afterwards, the association received a reply No. 21 from the Executive Yuan, stating that the submitted documents have been reviewed and that the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Military Administration have been ordered to investigate and handle the matter. This reply is for your information.</p>
<h3 id="e137">All Sectors Assist in Air Defense Equipment <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The National Lawyers Association telegraphed to all lawyers' associations nationwide yesterday, stating that at the seventh standing committee meeting of the current session held by the association on February 1st, all members believed that in the Battle of Shanghai, the Japanese army relied on aircraft to carry out wanton bombing, turning the city into a heap of ruins, with blood and flesh scattered everywhere. The tragic scene was unbearable to recall. Now, the enemy is becoming more and more aggressive, and the disaster is becoming more and more urgent. If we do not rise up immediately and build air defense, then which of our splendid cities will not be a place for the Japanese army to drop bombs, and whose blood and flesh of our compatriots will not be targets for the Japanese army to drop bombs? Learning from the past and drawing lessons for the future, we are deeply shocked. Therefore, it was decided that the association will send a telegram to all member associations to jointly donate funds to purchase an aircraft, named "China Lawyers," to contribute to resisting the enemy. The donations will be collected and managed by the designated bank of the second executive committee of the current session from February 19th. This matter concerns a crucial plan to save the country, so we are sending this telegram to your esteemed association for your information and compliance. Please also reply. Furthermore, the staff of this association intends to make every effort to donate to promote the cause. We will deposit the funds as soon as the designated bank is determined and will telegraph again. Kowtowing from Liu Liumin, Jiang Yong, Yan Yinwu, Liu Zhe, and Dai Tianqiu, standing committee members of the Lawyers Association of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Shanghai Lawyers Association: Yesterday, executive committee member Zhu Fuju submitted a proposal stating that he proposed donating one aircraft and one anti-aircraft gun to benefit air defense and promote the cause. Since the September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident occurred, the Japanese army has been annexing our Northeast and ravaging our Shanghai, advancing step by step like a rapacious wolf and a long snake. To this day, Rehe is in danger, and North China is shocked. The enemy's disaster is deepening day by day, and the country is facing imminent doom. The most cruel weapon used by the Japanese army in its war of aggression is aircraft. Our soldiers who are resisting the enemy are bravely advancing, one falling and another following. It is not that the fighting is not strong, but that the weapons are insufficient. Among the weapons, those related to the air force are the most lacking, so we suffer significant sacrifices for no reason. People in the country are aware of this and are loudly calling for and promoting the air force, and many have already launched fund-raising efforts for aircraft. Every citizen is responsible for the rise and fall of the nation. The association has always been enthusiastic about patriotism and should immediately catch up and fulfill its duty as a citizen. However, while aircraft are important tools for air combat, anti-aircraft guns are also powerful weapons for air defense. If there had been one or two dozen anti-aircraft guns in the Battle of Shanghai, the Japanese aircraft would not have been able to wreak such havoc. Recently, the Northeastern volunteer army has also repeatedly called for the supply of air defense weapons. This shows that the importance of anti-aircraft guns is no less than that of aircraft. One focuses on increasing the efficiency of air combat, and the other focuses on resisting the enemy's power. The two complement each other and should not be neglected. Moreover, in terms of training personnel and various equipment, anti-aircraft guns are actually easier to implement than aircraft. With the enthusiasm of the members of this association and their ability, it should not be difficult to donate one aircraft and one anti-aircraft gun to achieve this goal. The righteousness will spread and surely attract more followers. Therefore, the method for raising funds is proposed as follows: 1. Appropriately allocate some public funds from the association. 2. Members should separately undertake fund-raising. 3. Deduct 5% of each member's public fees and remit them to the association once a month for a period of six months. The audit method will be determined separately. 4. Aim to raise 150,000 yuan. Is the above proposal appropriate? Please make a public decision.</p>
<p>Shanghai Nine Acres Area Business Community United Association: Yesterday, a representative meeting was held at the association to discuss measures to assist in aviation for national salvation. The attendees were very enthusiastic. Wang Changxiang was elected as chairman and reported on the purpose of the meeting, saying that the only urgent task for saving the country at present is to rely on aviation. Now, various trade associations, domestic product organizations, and even children are donating funds to assist the government. The business community in the Nine Acres area has always been patriotic and should not be left behind. At this time of national crisis, how should we rise up and contribute to fulfill our duty as citizens? After discussion, the following thirteen people were elected as members of the committee to assist in aviation for national salvation: Xian Guansheng, Wang Changxiang, Chen Jicheng, Zhang Bingxin, Pan Jiaming, Zhu Bingru, Chen Xiangsheng, Le Zixiang, Wu Xianglin, Li Fushou, Xie Jiuxiang, Huang Gongxia, and Zhu Cilin. Chen Jicheng was elected as the convener of the first meeting, followed by a discussion of the association's work, which is omitted.</p>

<p>Qu Wenliu, who returned to Shanghai from Beiping and Tianjin after distributing relief, had previously sent a telegram to Xiong Bingnan, stating that the Shanghai Charity Federation was actively raising relief funds for Northeastern refugees and that the charity champagne was being prepared. Regarding relief on the Rehe border, he requested Yang Zigong to quickly transport cotton clothing to the front for timely distribution, and that Feng Yangshan would go north immediately, etc. Yesterday, a reply telegram was received from Xiong, stating that the telegram had been received with respect, that the relief clothing was being transported, and that the funds were also being transported. However, there was a shortage of food in Rehe, and 80,000 hungry people were waiting for food. Grain needed to be purchased quickly to provide relief. Please inform the gentlemen of the association. Respectfully, Xiling.</p>

<p>Catholics Prepare a Fond Farewell</p>
<p>Archbishop Celso Costantini, the Apostolic Delegate to China, has made meticulous plans and worked hard for the Catholic affairs in China since his arrival. Two years ago, Archbishop Costantini selected six Chinese priests and sent them to Rome, where they were personally consecrated by Pope Pius XI. After Archbishop Costantini and others returned to China, he assigned the six new bishops to reside in important dioceses. Recently, the country was divided into sixteen dioceses, and the church affairs have been thriving. In addition, he has also tried his best to assist in educational and charitable undertakings in various parts of China. Archbishop Costantini is particularly fond of China, so foreigners call him a "Sinicized Bishop." Archbishop Costantini followed the Pope's instructions and devoted himself to developing church affairs in our country. After residing in China for many years, he has become ill due to overwork and cannot be cured in a short period of time. Yesterday, he arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing and is scheduled to take a small ferry from the Customs Wharf to the Yangshupu Wharf at 5:00 PM today to board the Kenting ship to return to Italy for long-term rest. In this city, Lu Bohong has launched a campaign to invite Catholic organizations, the Shanghai Catholic Action Association, the Dongjiadu Fire Administration of the Shanghai South District, Zhengxiu, the First, Second, and Third Primary Schools, and a military band to go to the wharf to give a warm and grand send-off at that time.</p>

<p>The Hetao region in the Northwest is vast and sparsely populated, with abundant resources. However, due to its remote location, it has been largely neglected by the Chinese people.

It is learned that the third group of 45 members, led by Captain Yang Liushou, departed northward on the 9:30 am train yesterday. They are expected to arrive in Baotou later this month, where they will join the first and second groups to establish a woolen mill and engage in reclamation. It is also reported that the chief of general affairs of the corps, Mr. Yan Ziduan, will also travel north again within this month for an on-the-spot investigation.</p>

<p>Total Quantity of 90,000 Tons at a Net Price of Ten Silver Dollars per Ton</p>
<p>At the end of last year, the Jinghu, Huhangyong, and Ningbo Railways, considering the large amount of coal used annually, and to save costs, intended to order national coal of excellent quality and reasonable price in batches. The matter was submitted to the Ministry of Railways, which entrusted the Purchasing Committee to order 90,000 tons from Zhongxing Company. The price per ton, including all taxes and fees, was ten national dollars, a particularly favorable price, unprecedented. Delivery would be at Pukou. The Purchasing Committee has already signed the contract. The quality, composition, and inspection procedures have also been specified in detail. Therefore, recently, the two railways have prepared a large number of trains, ships, and workers to unload and transfer the coal at Pukou to various stations. The first batch of goods will be cleared soon. The bureau has also selected capable staff to go there to supervise the weighing and other matters to avoid losses.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Yu Yan Discusses the Reorganization of Railway Operations <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>| Two Points Contributing to Future Directions |</p>
<p>Yu Yan, Director of the Operations Department of the Ministry of Railways, discussed the reorganization of railway operations over the past six months and the future direction as follows: 1. Responsible Transportation of Goods: The effectiveness of responsible transportation has been proven by facts. According to the Jinpu Railway, since the full implementation of responsible transportation, the revenue for November of the 21st year was 2,161,886.66 yuan, while the revenue for the same month of the 20th year was 1,619,299.43 yuan, an increase of 542,587.23 yuan. This increase is by no means solely due to the increase in freight rates. Moreover, the Jinpu Railway's revenue in recent years has mainly come from passenger transport. Comparing the same months of the two years shows that the main reason for the increase is that freight transport exceeded passenger transport, which is very clear. Secondly, comparing December of last year with the same month of the previous year, the movement of troops and the transportation of military pay and equipment were continuous, and military transport was extremely busy, with almost all vehicles being used for military transport. However, the increase in revenue still reached 225,030.86 yuan. Furthermore, in the first ten days of January this year, there was also a significant increase of 249,506.61 yuan compared to the same period of the previous year. The above increases are all based on facts and can be made public. Secondly, after the January 28th Incident, the Jinghu and Huhangyong Railways suffered heavy losses, and their capacity was insufficient. However, the revenue from freight transport alone on the Jinghu Railway in November of the 21st year still increased by more than 60,000 yuan compared to the same month of the previous year. Of this, responsible freight charges only accounted for slightly more than 20,000 yuan, and the rest was the actual increase in freight revenue. Due to the Yuguan Incident, the situation changed in December of the 21st year, and freight transport was inevitably affected. However, it still increased by more than 5,900 yuan compared to the same month of the 20th year. The fact that this railway, despite being dilapidated and suffering significant losses of locomotives and vehicles, was still able to achieve this result is a good sign for the future of responsible transportation.

Preparations are underway and have yielded considerable results.</p>

<p>Ministry of Communications Has No Concrete Merger Plan; Postal and Telegraph Associations Advocate Maintaining the Postal System</p>
<p>According to postal worker sources, postal services have been affected since the separation of the Savings and Remittance Bureau. In May of last year, the Postal and Telegraph Associations firmly proposed a plan to consolidate the foundation of the postal service, first advocating the abolition and merger of the Savings and Remittance Bureau as the right way to save the postal service. The government, in view of the past failures of separation, first accepted the principle of merger and established a Postal Economic System Research Committee to discuss the implementation of the merger. Since its establishment, progress has been slightly delayed due to political changes in the middle. Since Minister Zhu took over, the Postal Research Committee has handed over the preparation of the report to a special committee, which is generally quite detailed. Unexpectedly, Minister Zhu sent a letter to the Postal Research Committee, seemingly agreeing in principle, but the implementation plan for how to merge was vague and without concrete expression, resulting in the Postal Research Committee's work being delayed. Recently, the Ministry of Communications appointed Tang Baoshu as the new director and made large-scale changes to the directors and other office staff within the bureau. This kind of treatment not only violates government orders and the solution to the resumption of work, but also clearly shows that they have no intention of implementing the merger and maintaining the postal system. It is reported that the Postal and Telegraph Associations are submitting opinions to the Postal Research Committee and presenting them to the Ministry of Communications for attention. As for the rumors that the matter has been resolved, they are not true.</p>

<p>Trade Union Asks Mrs. Sun for Assistance; Huang Naishu Says He Has a Solution</p>
<p>According to the New Sound News Agency, after thirteen executive committee members of the Beiping Postal Workers' Union were arrested by the Beiping military police authorities on the 2nd of last month, the National Postal Workers' Union sent representatives to Beiping to investigate the truth. Yesterday, the Beiping Postal Workers' Union sent a telegram to Mrs. Sun Yat-sen (Soong Ching-ling), requesting assistance. However, according to Postal Director Huang Naishu, the matter has a solution. The information obtained is recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e152">Telegram to Mrs. Sun <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The Beiping Postal Workers' Union sent a telegram to Mrs. Sun Yat-sen (Soong Ching-ling): Mrs. Premier, regarding the matter of appealing for assistance, the Beiping Post Office and Postmaster Bali Di, (an Italian), colluded with the military police on February 2nd to arrest all thirteen executive committee members of the Beiping Postal Workers' Anti-Japanese Association. Immediately thereafter, a bureau notice was issued, dismissing the thirteen people on the grounds of disobeying orders, neglecting bureau affairs, falsely accusing superiors, and violating the postal code. The thirteen people are loyal comrades of our association and have been very active in working hard to resist Japan. Even if resisting Japan is a violation of the postal code, it still falls within the scope of the postal service and does not bear criminal responsibility. Why should they be arrested and detained? Moreover, they have been detained for more than 24 hours and have not been handed over to the court, which is a trampling of human rights. This is the first point. The Beiping military police authorities do not distinguish between right and wrong, acting as accomplices, surrounding the post office, closing down the trade union, arbitrarily interfering in post office affairs, and unreasonably arresting and detaining civil servants, which is also illegal. This is the second point. The thirteen people are members of the Anti-Japanese Committee. The military police authorities and the postal authorities must get rid of them at all costs. Is the authorities hindering resistance to Japan? This is the third point. We respectfully present an outline and ask you to quickly telegraph the Beiping authorities to immediately restore the work of the thirteen people. The situation is urgent, and we cannot help but wait for orders in trepidation. Mrs. Soong Ching-ling has already telegraphed the Beiping authorities yesterday to release them.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the reporter of the New Sound News Agency visited Director Huang Naishu of the Postal Bureau again to ask about the truth of the matter. According to him, the reason for the arrest of the Beiping Postal Workers' Union members was actually because of the serious situation in North China, the precautions were extremely tight, and those who were slightly active, like those making trouble, would be arrested to prevent accidents. This is one of the measures taken by the Beiping military police authorities to maintain local peace. The postal authorities had nothing to do with it. However, after the National Postal Workers' Union sent personnel to investigate, a telegram was received today saying that there was already a considerable solution.</p>

<p>The Shanghai County Government has received an instruction from the Jiangsu Provincial Government stating that, due to the financial difficulties of the province and counties, austerity measures should be implemented to save money and increase administrative efficiency. The various bureaus of the county should be appropriately abolished and merged. Only those bureaus that can comply with this order will be allowed to operate. It is known that, in addition to the Public Security Bureau, which had already changed from a bureau to a section, the remaining bureaus are the Finance, Construction, and Education Bureaus. It is now learned that the Finance Bureau has been ordered to be abolished and merged, and its functions will be handled by a section established by the County Government. The Education Bureau, due to its annual education expenditure exceeding 120,000 yuan, will not be abolished. The Construction Bureau, due to the need for planned construction after the county seat moves, will also not be abolished for the time being. County Finance Director Wang Huazhao has ordered the sections to expedite the completion of the closure of the bureau by March 1st, so that it can be handed over to the County Government at that time.</p>

The construction of the venue is entirely in Chinese style, with a library, lecture hall, and museum. Due to financial constraints, the museum will not be open to the public for the time being. According to Mr. Abraham, Honorary Secretary of the Society, the Society has requested an annual subsidy of 45,000 taels of silver from the Shanghai Municipal Council. If approved, the museum could be opened to the public within two months. The new building cost a total of 160,000 taels of silver, of which only 115,000 taels have been raised. The Society plans to borrow the shortfall from local banks. If the Shanghai Municipal Council can provide an annual subsidy of 45,000 taels, repaying the debt will be easy.</p>

<h3 id="e167">Italian Rayon Imports Valued at 7 Million Yuan <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>A Total of 1,750 Pieces Were Imported, and Chinese Businessmen Plan to Invest in Establishing a Rayon Factory</p>
<p>At a time when China's silk exports are sluggish, rayon imports are again crowded. The silk fabrics exported by China's silk mills all use rayon. Although the customs has increased import duties, imports decreased last year. However, due to increased demand in China, rayon imports have surged again in recent days. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Large Batch Arrives <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Rayon manufactured and shipped from Italy is considered the best. The best-selling products on the market are those from the Chatillon and Cisa factories. After the Ministry of Finance increased the import tax on rayon last year, it was temporarily hindered. However, recently, the products of Chinese silk mills cannot appeal to buyers without mixing rayon, so they are purchased at high prices. The Italian mail ship Ganqi arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, carrying a large batch of 1,750 pieces of rayon, with a total value of 7 million yuan including the price of goods and customs duties. This is the first large amount of rayon imported this year.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Stored in Customs Warehouse <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>The price of each piece of rayon, weighing about 200 pounds, is about 130 taels of Shanghai silver. In the past, the import tax was calculated at 75% of the value, about 10 taels of silver per piece. Last year, the Ministry of Finance revised the tariff regulations and listed it as a luxury item, increasing the import tax to 99 taels, 1 mace and 8 fen per piece. The second revision of the tariff rate changed the goods to 124 taels, 8 mace and 3 fen per piece. Converted from 141 customs gold to silver, each piece must be over 160 taels of standard silver. The large amount of rayon brought this time requires a tax of over 3.8 million taels just for customs duties. The importing foreign firms do not have such a huge amount of money to pay, so yesterday they stored the goods in the customs warehouse, and will pay taxes on each piece when they are sold and unloaded.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Handling Firms <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The foreign firms in Shanghai that handle the import of rayon are Tianyou, Huajia, Kaili, Anli, Meizuishi, Anmao, and others. The largest businesses are Tianyou and Anli, which purchase and ship over a thousand or hundreds of pieces each time. The sales in Shanghai are to silk mills in Zhejiang Province, and some are shipped to the Yangtze River and the north and south oceans. Rayon is also shipped from Japan, but the quality is not as good as the Italian goods, and the price is lower. After the January 28th Incident last year, the import of Japanese rayon was not as high as before. Recently, it has been smuggled in secretly from Dalian.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Factory in Shanghai <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>A reporter met someone in the industry yesterday who said that Chinese businessmen are jointly investing with foreign businessmen to establish a rayon factory in Shanghai, manufacturing it locally for use by various silk factories. According to estimates, the cost of manufacturing each piece of rayon in Shanghai is only over 10 taels, plus the factory tax, which is only a tenth of the current import price. This matter is already being planned.</p>

Among them are jadeite and diamond gold medals, two treasures, each worth no less than four or five hundred yuan. With a prize ticket of two yuan, you can get a prize of over a thousand yuan. This is a rare opportunity. Patriotic men and women should go and see it. Also, the Association has not prepared many prize tickets this time, and buyers have been very enthusiastic in recent days. Those who buy later may regret it.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Major Gambling Den Cracked Down in Zhenru <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Public Security Bureau Dispatched Police at Midnight, Detaining a Total of Eighty-Nine Gamblers</p>
<p>Yang Miaogen, a local thug in Zhenru Town, has no legitimate occupation. Recently, he has been using the Lunar New Year as an excuse to set up a gambling den on North Street in the town, taking a cut for profit. According to reports, the Municipal Public Security Bureau secretly dispatched detectives the night before to arrest them, detaining a total of eighty-nine people. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Yang the Thug Taking a Cut <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Yang Miaogen was originally a vagrant. Since opening the gambling den at the beginning of this year, he has been luring good people in the town to gamble, and Yang has been reaping the profits. As a result, his daily life has also been different from the past, and his methods are generous. Those who do not know think he is a wealthy man. Zhenru is far from Shanghai, and gamblers in Shanghai heard about this place and flocked to it. As a result, Yang's daily income has also doubled.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Cracked Down at Midnight <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Because the gambling den still had to avoid people's eyes during the day, it was even more popular at midnight. After receiving reports, the Municipal Public Security Bureau dispatched a large number of detectives to Zhenru on the night before to cooperate with the Fourth District Third Precinct to carry out the arrest. When they arrived, they heard a noisy commotion in the house, and they were in high spirits. Fearing that the gamblers would escape, the detectives surrounded the house and then knocked on the door. Unexpectedly, the gamblers inside heard someone knocking on the door and knew something was wrong, so the order was disrupted and they fled in all directions. How could they know that they had been surrounded and were stopped one by one? A total of eighty-nine people were detained. That night, because they could not transport them all to Shanghai, they were detained overnight at the Fourth District Third Precinct. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the General Bureau along with the gambling equipment for investigation. Yang Miaogen, the leader of the gambling, was also among them.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Further News on the Tragic Case of Arresting Gamblers in Wusong Paotaiwan <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Hu Changxiu Killed in Police Shooting Case</p>
<p>Regarding the case of Gu Damao's family at No. 10, Gujiazhai, behind the old site of the China Public School in Wusong Paotaiwan, where police officer Hu Changxiu was shot and killed while arresting gamblers the day before yesterday, it is learned that the information contained in the report is slightly different. Yesterday, a reporter conducted an investigation and described the details as follows. It turned out that around 1:00 PM on the day before yesterday (the 7th), the Seventh District Police Station received a report that someone had set up a gambling den in that area. District Chief Li dispatched Inspector Yang Xihui, Patrol Captain Wang Xindong, Dong Jingyun, Jiang Zhixiu, and police officers Hu Changxiu, Li Zongchen, Peng Xuede, etc. to arrest them. When they arrived at the scene, they first secured the front and back doors of the house. At that time, there were about forty gamblers in the house, all trying to rush out the door. Some of the fierce ones, seeing that there were not many police officers, punched and injured Patrol Captain Dong Jingyun in the head. Seeing that the situation was not good, Patrol Captain Dong immediately drew his gun and fired two shots into the ground. At that time, the gamblers were still rushing outwards, pushing police officer Hu Changxiu to the ground. Unexpectedly, a bullet fired from Patrol Captain Dong's gun hit police officer Hu Changxiu in the neck. At that time, the order was slightly chaotic, and about twenty gamblers took the opportunity to escape. As a result, Gu Damao, Gu Guilin, Pu Fusheng, Jin Yunqing, Fei Amao, Fei Xiaodi, Pu Alin, Zhang Ada, Pan Baotang, Zhang Genhe, Zhang Ali, Liu Shenggen, Pan Jinsheng, Pan Aji, Zhang Qingqing, Zhang Xilin, Shen Asheng, Hu Gensheng, Jin Lansheng, and other nineteen people were detained and taken to the district for interrogation. The injured police officer Hu Changxiu was immediately sent to the Shanghai Baolong Hospital for treatment, but died on the way. The body was transported back to Wusong and temporarily placed in the Chu Laoda Temple. Yesterday, a report was filed with the local court, and Prosecutor Zhang was dispatched to Song to examine the body, confirming that he had died from gunshot wounds. Patrol Captain Dong, who caused the accident, was interrogated by District Chief Li yesterday. He confessed that when he fired a gun to warn, police officer Hu was pushed to the ground by the gamblers, resulting in accidental injury and death. After interrogation and verification, the gamblers were notified by long-distance telephone to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, which dispatched a red car to transfer Patrol Captain Dong and the gamblers to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for handling. According to District Chief Li, Patrol Captain Dong has been working in Song for many years, and has always been very diligent and has not made any mistakes. This accidental death of Hu Changxiu is a truly unfortunate incident. He is now trying to comfort the family of the deceased and find ways to mitigate the punishment for Patrol Captain Dong. As for the gamblers, there was no firing of guns.</p>

<p>Departed from Shanghai with a Huge Sum of 1,500 Yuan</p>
<p>500 Yuan Stolen on the Train, Dared Not Speak Out</p>
<p>After Arriving in Jiaxing, Gambling Friends and Lewd Women Continued Day and Night</p>
<p>Money Exhausted, Returned to Shanghai in a Sorry State, From Now on, Tasting the Flavor of Iron Bars</p>
<p>Dai Yuanbing, an apprentice from Anhui at the Zhengda Silk Factory at No. 168, Tianjin Road, is only twenty-one years old. He is usually diligent in his service and is quite favored by Manager Jiang Guoxiang. On December 20th of last year, Jiang ordered Dai to take a check for 500 yuan from the Bank of China and a check for 304 yuan from the China Trust Bank to the Tonghe Bank on Ningbo Road for deposit. Unexpectedly, Dai suddenly had a greedy idea and did not comply, but instead took the Bank of China check to the Bank of China and cashed it for 500 yuan. Because the China Trust Bank was far away, he tore up the check. Then, he stole a seal from the Zhengda Silk Factory and forged a check for 1,000 yuan, and went to the Notification Bank to get 1,000 yuan. In total, he cashed a total of 1,500 yuan from the Bank of China. So he abandoned his job and fled with the money. The silk factory did not know where he had gone and could not find him, so they had to report to the authorities to issue a warrant for his arrest. In fact, Dai took the Shanghai-Hangzhou train to Zhejiang Province. Unexpectedly, when the train arrived at Jiaxing Station, 500 yuan of the huge sum he was carrying was stolen by thieves. He had only 1,000 yuan left in his pocket, and he dared not speak out, but only sighed. He had no intention of moving forward, so he stopped at the Huaan Hotel at the North Gate of Jiahe. The waiter of the hotel, Jv Sheng, saw that Dai was sparsely dressed but had a lot of money in hand, and mistakenly thought he was a wealthy man who came to Jiaxing to play. He introduced local dandies and prostitutes, and they spent time together day and night. After more than a month, the 1,000 yuan he brought was lost 800 in gambling and 200 in whoring. The hotel owner ordered him to leave. The old gambling friends and lewd friends all avoided him. Dai began to feel sorry for himself, but he was lonely and helpless in a foreign land. There was no point in staying, so he returned to Shanghai the day before and hid in the Huping Hotel on North Fujian Road. After thinking it over again, he felt that his uncle Jiang Dizhai had always treated him well and might be able to help him. Therefore, he telephoned Dizhai and told him his reckless history, saying that he only had suicide as a way out, begging him to remember their past friendship and come to see him for the last time. Dizhai told his brother Jiang Guoxiang and reported to the Laozha Public Security Bureau, which dispatched detectives Wang Jiaju and Li Shugui to the hotel to arrest Dai. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Special District Local Court, where Judge Feng Shide interrogated him. Zhang Shizhu, the lawyer of the Public Security Bureau, stated the case, saying that the defendant had committed the crimes of embezzlement in violation of Articles 357 and forgery in violation of Article 224 of the Criminal Law, and should be punished according to law. Dai Yuanbing fully admitted to the charges. Judge Feng immediately sentenced each crime to one year in prison, to be served concurrently for a term of one year and six months. This is truly reaping what he sowed.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Coal Merchant Pan Gengsheng's House Robbed Yesterday <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Losses Exceeded 6,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Pan Gengsheng, from Wuxi, is 59 years old. He used to be a lime barge operator. Recently, he has been a broker for the Kaiping Coal Mine's Shanghai depot, and rents a front room on the second floor of the Shenlongtai Foreign Iron Shop at No. 114, Xiamen Road, as a residence. Pan usually lives frugally, so he has saved a little money over the years. Unexpectedly, he was coveted by bandits. At around 8:30 AM yesterday morning, Pan had just finished washing up and was about to send the collected coal money of about 5,000 yuan to the Wufeng Money Exchange for storage, when he suddenly heard a knock on the door. Pan asked who it was, and the person outside the door replied, "Open the door, Boss Pan." Pan thought it was a coal customer urging for coal, so he opened the door. Unexpectedly, the three people who came were strangers. After entering the room, they took out handguns and ordered Pan Gengsheng to open the silver box in the room, or they would kill him. Pan had no choice but to take out the key and open the silver box, allowing them to search it. However, the bandits saw that the upper drawer in the box was locked and could not get started, so they turned around and ordered Pan to open it again. Pan firmly refused. At that time, one of the bandits saw that Pan was holding a bunch of keys tightly in his right hand, so he stepped forward to grab it. The victim resisted with all his might. The bandit, in a hurry, bit Pan's right thumb and the back of his hand. Pan was in extreme pain and released his hand. The bandits were able to open the upper drawer and plunder everything. Seeing that they had achieved their goal, the bandits tried to escape, but were afraid that Pan would take the opportunity to call for help, so they pushed Pan into the middle floor when they left, and locked the door from the outside and fled. The victim saw that the thieves had gone far away, so he tried his best to call for help. Later, a friend of Shenlongtai downstairs heard about it and released Pan, who rushed to report to the police and requested to pursue the thieves. It is said that one of the three thieves was wearing a blue cloth gown, about forty years old, and two were wearing brown coats, both in their twenties, with local accents. The victim's losses included a pair of gold bracelets, ten gold rings, and more than 5,000 yuan in cash, totaling about 6,000 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e180">Record of Continued Hearing of the Running Dog Association's Lawsuit Against Martin, etc. <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Special Use of Dog Race Betting Proceeds</p>
<p>Allegedly for Payment of Stamp Tax to the Central Government</p>
<p>The Running Dog Association, due to the closure of the Ming Garden Dog Racing Track, sued Martin, the current acting Chief of the Public Works Bureau's Police (who was the acting Chief at the time), and former Chairman of the Board MacNaughton, seeking damages of 2.5 million taels. The hearing continued the day before yesterday afternoon before Sir Grain, the British Receiver, with the plaintiff's witness, Mr. Bowyer, a shareholder of the Thomson &amp; Co. and former secretary and accountant of the Running Dog Club, giving his testimony. The hearing continued yesterday morning at 10 a.m., with Mr. Bowyer being cross-examined by Mr. Huber Bowe, the defendant's chief lawyer. However, the questions all concerned the Running Dog Club, and Mr. Bowyer often appeared hesitant and embarrassed in his answers. (Note: The Running Dog Club is another organization formed by the people of the Running Dog Association, engaged in running the dog races. The Running Dog Association, the plaintiff in this case, is a limited company that owns the dog racing track and leases it to the Club. Therefore, the grounds for the lawsuit are mainly based on preventing people from entering the park.) Several points particularly caught the attention of the entire court during yesterday morning's questioning. One was that in the income and expenditure report of the Club for the year ending October 1930, it was noted that the Club set aside 11% of the dog race betting proceeds, with 1% for a special purpose. When Mr. Huber Bowe asked what that special purpose was, the plaintiff's lawyer immediately approached the defendant's lawyer for a brief whispered conversation. Then, the defendant's lawyer consulted with the two defendants. Finally, Mr. Bowyer was asked to answer, and he stated that it was reserved for paying stamp tax to the Central Government. Subsequently, Mr. Huber Bowe intended to continue questioning the details of paying this tax, but Mr. Bowyer was unwilling to answer and the matter was dropped. Regarding the program offered by Ming Garden Lu and the automobile company for 30 cents, which included a free one-yuan admission ticket, the defendant's lawyer pointed out that it was an official program. However, Mr. Bowyer was unable to clearly explain whether it was an official program or an unofficial one. Another time, Mr. Huber Bowe questioned the advertisement fee of 44,800 yuan, asking what the purpose of this advertisement was. He asked if the Club was truly willing to spend 44,800 yuan annually just to invite people to the park to watch dogs, and wasn't the purpose of extensively advertising in newspapers to entice people to come and bet on the dog races? At that moment, the audience burst into laughter. Mr. Bowyer's response was remarkably calm, stating that he simply wanted people to know that there were dog races taking place in the park. After Mr. Bowyer finished testifying, Mr. Adams, the secretary of the China Business Company, was called to testify. However, because the documents needed to prove Mr. Adams' testimony were not yet prepared, he was asked to leave and scheduled to testify again in the afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Kidnapping Bandit and Informant in Trouble <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Commotion Erupts in Detention Center</p>
<p>Bandit Accuses Informant of Being an Accomplice</p>
<p>Fang Jinhong, a Cantonese man and the Import Department Director of Sincere Company, was previously kidnapped by bandits. Fang resisted during the abduction, leading to his murder by the bandits. Later, based on information from an informant, the police of the Mixed Court arrested ten bandits, including Zhang Qishan, and handed them over to the First Special District Court for trial. The trial concluded on the morning of the 7th, with sentences pronounced. The news was reported yesterday. It is now known that the informant's name is Cao Houfu (also known as Zhao Xinggui), 37 years old, from Tongzhou, living on Longjiang Road. He usually works as a vendor at a stall at the intersection of Changping Road and Gordon Road in West Shanghai. Since reporting Zhang Qishan and others for the kidnapping case, Zhang and others implicated him in the case during the trial, even vaguely suggesting that he was the ringleader. However, the authorities feared that this was a malicious accusation and did not immediately arrest him, continuing a secret investigation. On the 6th of this month, Cao was arrested by the Yulin Road police for gambling at Lan Road. The next morning, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court, where he was fined six yuan. According to the customary procedure of the police, criminal offenders who have been tried must be taken to the detention center on the side of the Special Court's main gate before being transported back to the police station in batches by prison van, in accordance with the court's instructions. Therefore, after Cao's fine was determined, he was taken by the police from the Eighth Court to the detention center to wait for the prison van. It happened to be the day that the bandits, including Zhang Qishan, who murdered Fang Jinhong, were sentenced. Moments after Cao entered the detention center, Zhang and the other nine bandits were sentenced by the Second Criminal Court and escorted back to the detention center. At this point, enemies met, and their eyes were particularly sharp. Zhang Qishan, upon entering the detention center, suddenly saw Cao already there. He immediately scolded him sharply, accusing him of leaking information. The other nine bandits also joined in the attack, and Cao became the target of everyone's anger. The patrol officers in the detention center initially did not know the reason for the bandits' difficulty with Cao. While stopping the commotion, they asked what was going on. Zhang and others unanimously claimed that Cao was their accomplice and the ringleader. The patrol officer reported this to his superiors, who ordered Cao to be taken to the Yulin Road police station for investigation. Because Zhang Qishan and his gang of bandits were arrested by the police of the Mixed Court, and Cao was accused of being an accomplice, and the case involved kidnapping, extortion, and murder of the hostage, both the truth and falsehood should be thoroughly investigated. For the sake of convenience, Cao was still sent to the Mixed Court police station for investigation by experienced personnel. Yesterday morning, Detective Wang Youshan of the police station escorted Cao to the First Special Court, where Judge Qian Wenqiong interrogated him. First, Wang Yaotang, the police station's lawyer, explained the situation and requested that Cao be temporarily detained for investigation. However, according to Cao's statement, his fellow villager, Hu Guangshan, recently came to Shanghai from their hometown, saying that a girl in their family was kidnapped by Zhang Qishan's gang. Because I knew Zhang, he asked me about Zhang's whereabouts. On December 29th, while I was running my stall at the intersection of Changping Road and Gordon Road, I saw Zhang and four or five others entering a teahouse there to drink tea. I remembered Hu's words and paid attention to them. Later, I reported it to my friend Chen Laosi. Chen is a detective, and later Chen and Chinese and foreign detectives arrested Zhang and others. I have a family to support and would never be a bandit. I am being falsely accused. Judge Qian then ordered Cao Houfu to be detained and investigated, with a new hearing date to be scheduled.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Ministry of Railways Reduces Freight Rates for Ceramics from Pottery and Porcelain <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways recently stated that pottery produced in Boshan, Shandong Province, is essential for the daily use of ordinary people, such as jars, basins, pots, bowls, cups, bottles, plates, and casseroles. These are the crudest ceramics produced by local handicrafts and are vastly different from porcelain from Jiangxi. The original freight rates were the same as for other porcelain, classified as fifth class, which was inconvenient. Now, for the sake of local industry, these crude ceramics will be reclassified as sixth class. Finer materials, such as teapots, teacups, wine cups, plates, dishes, pots, bottles, and bowls, will still be charged at the fifth class rate to show differentiation. The "Ceramics and Kiln Goods" item in the Ministry's Freight Transportation Classification Table will be modified, divided into three classes: special products from Jiangxi, Hebei, Henan, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Shandong, and other provinces will be classified as fourth class; superior products will be classified as fifth class; and ordinary products will be classified as sixth class. Orders have been issued to all routes to collect freight according to the class to ensure uniformity.</p>

<p>Shanghai Da Zhen Shipping Company has owned the Yong Ping and Yong An steamers that operate on the Shanghai-Sea routes. Since its establishment, it has strived for perfection in its facilities. It has built warehouses in Shanghai and Dapu, which are very large and provide responsible protection for passengers and goods, avoiding exposure and leakage. It has always been praised by customers, and its business is developing daily. Due to the continuous flow of goods from the Longhai Railway, the company's original two steamers are insufficient for transportation. A new Yong Ji fast steamer has been added to the fleet. The steamer has a deadweight of 3,000 tons and a shallow draft. It officially began operating on February 6th.</p>

<p>Dredging of No. 8 Will Also Begin</p>
<p>Shanghai South Pier No. 9 has been completed with funds advanced by the Lian An Shipping Bureau. However, due to the high silt accumulation on the shore, it is difficult for ships to dock, so the pier has not been equipped. The Municipal Public Works Bureau previously consulted with the Whangpoo Conservancy Bureau to send a machine to dredge the area. It is reported that the work has been completed, with a total of 6,000 cubic yards of silt removed. Pier No. 8, which is adjacent to Pier No. 9, is also experiencing increasing silt accumulation, making it impossible for ships to dock even at high tide. It is reported that the Public Works Bureau has obtained approval from the Municipal Government to dredge it as well. Construction will begin soon, and there should be no difficulties for ships to dock side by side in the future.</p>

<p>Shanghai Charity Hospital in Tangjiawan, Ximen, has been established for fifteen years. It has always adhered to the principle of charity and relief for the poor and sick, providing medical treatment and medicine with all its efforts. Due to the increasing number of poor and sick people seeking treatment, the existing facilities are insufficient. For the welfare of the patients, it moved to a new building at the north end of Lanwei Road and Lafayette Road in the French Concession the day before yesterday, expanded its wards, and hired doctors in various departments to provide medical treatment and medicine as usual to ensure thoroughness. As a result, a large number of poor and sick people have been going to the hospital for treatment in recent days.</p>

<h3 id="e189">How to Achieve Local Autonomy? <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>丨Continuing yesterday's reply to Mr. Lü Jingming's letter丨</p>
<p>㈡ You said: [China was originally a large agricultural society, so local autonomy should start in the countryside], which is also self-contradictory. You said earlier that [true local autonomy in a region must be successful after the economy and culture have been developed to a considerable stage]. Then, we must ask: Where does the economy and culture of the countryside come from? Obviously: Where do the machines and plows needed in rural areas come from? Where do the primary school teachers needed in rural areas come from? Where do the books for establishing libraries in rural areas come from? Doesn't all of this require the city to supply it? Doesn't it require the economy and culture of the city to reach a certain stage of development? Since the economy and culture of the city must first develop to a certain stage before rural autonomy can be discussed, then what does your statement that [local autonomy should start in the countryside] really mean? Now that the city has achieved a considerable development of its economy and culture, but you don't let it start with autonomy, isn't this treating the people in the city like [idiots]? Why are you so partial to the countryside and treat the city so poorly? The most illogical argument of the general public in China is the saying that [China is founded on agriculture]. Those who say this think that only China has been founded on agriculture from ancient times to the present, and that it is an unchanging and unique social phenomenon. In fact, this is an illogical argument for those who do not understand the history of social development and do not read Western history. At a certain stage of historical development, a country must go through the form of development of a rural economy. The only difference is that some are long and some are short. If you understand this point, then you will not use the words "founded on agriculture" as China's patent. The economic systems of almost all European countries in the Middle Ages were founded on agriculture. France was still an agricultural country during the era of the Great Revolution. The United States also had a rural economy dominating in its early stages. Russia was still a huge, simple agricultural country in the early 19th century. How can the claim that [China is founded on agriculture] or, as you said, [China was originally a large agricultural society] be used as the basis for starting local autonomy in the countryside? However, the advocacy of this kind of argument that [China is founded on agriculture] by a group of Chinese gentry and the ignorant teachers in most educational circles is not blind and unintentional, but rather has their own interests as a backdrop. In general, representatives of landlords and feudal remnants want to use this theory丨China is founded on agriculture!丨as a smokescreen to cover their conservative or regressive tendencies. To be honest: only the city leads the form of social development in the countryside; there is no form of social development in the countryside leading the city (of course, to some extent, changes in the countryside can also affect the city, but this is not the main and leading role). So, to talk about local autonomy, it can only start with the city. This is one point. Local autonomy is not an isolated social phenomenon, but rather the entirety of the entire social political organization and economic system. If you talk about local autonomy apart from the entire social change, then you are really only seeing the trees and not the forest. This is the second point. As we have mentioned earlier, true local autonomy is not a peaceful favor given by law or command, but rather the result of mass social movements. Local autonomy that is not obtained from actual actions is merely an officially permitted local official's autonomy, and it is just another form of autocracy. This is the third point. Local autonomy is unconditionally universal. It cannot be used as an excuse to withhold it due to some level of economic and cultural development. This is the fourth point. As for what you call [experts in people's education], they cannot be regarded as a prerequisite for local autonomy, let alone the main body of local autonomy. They are merely a kind of machine, a kind of tool, a kind of technical talent of local autonomy. That is to say, their research is not [a glimmer of dawn for the future of rural governance], but rather the urgent need for autonomy felt by the largest majority of the masses in the countryside. Everyone uniting and going to the streets to do actual work is the true glimmer of dawn for local autonomy. This is the fifth point. What do you think? ㈢ We have not seen the full text of Mr. Liang Shuming's criticism of rural autonomy, but just based on the points you mentioned, we can see a glimpse. Mr. Liang's words originally had a metaphysical tinge everywhere, and we really don't understand some of his remarks. ㈠ [If we increase the wealth of the countryside in the same way as running schools, then I'm afraid it will be very trivial]. Then, what method should be used to increase the wealth of the countryside? And what kind of method is the so-called [method of running schools]? This is a kind of indiscriminate statement. ㈡ [Industry must be developed before culture can be improved]. Who will develop this industry? For whom will this industry be developed? And what kind of culture is the so-called culture? Mr. Liang did not add detailed boundaries, so it is still a kind of indiscriminate statement. ㈢ [Using the method of running education to carry out rural improvement movements will inevitably lead to the road of losing both talent and money]. This is again creating mystery! What kind of [method of running education] is Mr. Liang talking about? Why, when the method of running education is applied to rural improvement movements, does it have to [lose both talent and money]? Indeed, this kind of method of running education itself will collapse. Not only will it lose both talent and money when applied to rural improvement movements, but it is also afraid that it will not be able to avoid this kind of malpractice even when applied to education itself. In reality, the words "losing both talent and money" are simply incomprehensible! Mr. Liang should still go and talk about his [㈠ Western life is the intuitive use of reason: ㈡ Chinese life is the rational use of intuition: ㈢ Indian life is the rational use of immediate experience]. It's good to talk about those mysterious idealist philosophies. If he wants to talk about our local autonomy, we really don't need his high-level theories! As for what you call [what else can we do? What other brilliant methods are there?], after reading our explanations above, perhaps you will no longer have such doubts, right? What do you think?</p>

<h3 id="e192">The Mission of China National Goods Company <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Pan</p>
<p>In this national goods movement, the financial and industrial sectors, in order to seek active construction, have established China National Goods Company. This is not only an important record of national goods, but also a worthy record in the history of the national goods movement in China. This seems to be just a cooperative business in terms of sales, but it is also the first step in production and sales cooperation. Therefore, the National Goods Company really bears a significant mission in the future of the national goods movement.</p>
<p>Those in charge of the National Goods Company this time are mostly leaders with real strength in the industrial and commercial sectors. In terms of implementation, of course, there will be detailed and perfect plans to meet the expectations of the city's citizens. However, this National Goods Company is not only attracting attention from all industries and regions, but also the success or failure of this company is greatly related to the reputation of the national goods industry. Therefore, while we hope that fellow citizens will be determined to use national goods and do their best to cultivate this emerging national goods industry, we also hope that the colleagues of the National Goods Company will have the determination to serve and sacrifice, and engage in this business with a significant mission.</p>
<p>Regarding the determination to manage the business, because of the close interests involved, people will naturally work hard in their positions. They will also understand that this is a social undertaking, be more vigilant, reduce all bad prejudices, and enhance the status of our national goods. As for all the comrades serving in the company, they must eliminate all bad behavior and cultivate the ethos of model employees, because the loss of a customer by an ordinary store is only the loss of one store, while the loss of the National Goods Company will affect the entire national goods industry!</p>
<p>In the past, we were saddened and angered by the fact that ordinary merchants specialized in selling imported goods, but they all replied that national goods were not easy to sell. Now that the National Goods Company, which specializes in selling national goods, has opened, this is certainly an opportunity for our national goods production sector to examine and improve itself, and it is also an opportunity for ordinary merchants to test the sales of national goods. Moreover, in recent times, leaders in the industrial and commercial sectors in Chongqing, Qingdao, Shantou, and other places are all carrying out this business. The success or failure of our Shanghai efforts is really enough to affect their actions. Therefore, the National Goods Company is not only a new business in the national goods movement, but also the central business of the national goods movement. We should do our best to manage it. In particular, everyone must have a sense of responsibility, self-confidence, and willingness to sacrifice. Don't just do it for yourself, do it for others. Don't just take care of private business, take care of the overall situation. Don't just focus on sales, pay attention to production. Don't just benefit the production sector, but also consider the consumer.</p>
<p>This is certainly just the beginning of cooperation on the sales front, but it is also the starting point for production and sales cooperation. We must lay the foundation this time in order to engage in future large-scale cooperation in production, purchasing, and other aspects with the same industry. Therefore, both internally and externally, for the sake of the entire national goods movement, we should pay attention to the China National Goods Company and support the China National Goods Company at all times.</p>
<p>Interview Notes</p>
<h3 id="e193">Mr. Wu Yun Chu Talks About the Record of the Completion of European and American Surveys <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Wu Yun Chu is an authority in China's chemical industry. While monosodium glutamate has certainly established his achievements and status, in recent years he has also been engaged in the electrical industry, standing in a leading position in the emerging national goods industrial and commercial circles, and catching up head-on in the international production circles as well. His intelligence and vision are truly admirable. However, Mr. Wu himself has never been complacent with the current situation. Therefore, he went to Europe and America for further investigation last year. This spirit of research and progress is still rarely seen in our industrial and commercial circles. Mr. Wu returned to China a few months ago, and the reporter went to the Tianchu Factory to pay a visit. He talked about his various feelings from this trip, many of which can be used as a reference for our industrial and commercial circles, so I will introduce them later.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu's purpose for going abroad this time was to conduct technical investigations. He visited 73 factories in countries such as Japan, the United States, Britain, France, Italy, and Belgium, including electrical, green gas, alkali burning, gelatin, and starch industries. They were all closely related to the businesses that Mr. Wu is currently running. Mr. Wu paid more attention to the light gas and fiber chemical industries that he was designing this time during his investigations, and he studied them at all times. Now the drawings and plans have been completed. Mr. Wu kept a detailed diary during this trip. Because there were more records on technical aspects, the reporter only talked to Mr. Wu about some of his impressions from this trip, especially those related to our Chinese national goods industrial and commercial circles.</p>
<p>Regarding production, according to Mr. Wu's observation, since 1929, due to the progress of machinery and scientific management, foreign countries have gone from a shortage of labor to an overproduction, forming the current wave of unemployment. However, regarding the chemical industry, among the many factories in Europe, labor is still used more often because it is more accurate. Therefore, our emerging national goods production sector should not repeat the mistakes of others and blindly follow trends when it comes to machinery. There are also many old machines in foreign factories, and they have not been discarded but are still being used for production. Our Chinese people's erroneous concepts should also be eliminated. Regarding the issue of production raw materials, the United States, which advocates mass production, sometimes inevitably wastes them. France, on the other hand, treasures even scraps of wood and carefully stores them, and even garbage has a use. It uses heat as power, and slag as building materials, without wasting anything.</p>
<p>What is especially shocking to us is that modern warfare has already become a war of materials. In addition to ordinary production, industrial circles in various countries must also take into account the use of national defense. Not only is the police already militarized like the national defense army, but also ordinary factories丨famous ones such as Germany's Krupp and France's Schneider丨can be converted into arsenals at any time. In this environment full of national disasters, seeing others' deep planning and foresight, and thinking about our own lack of preparation, what kind of feelings should we have? This point really cannot but be reported to our national goods production sector.</p>
<p>Therefore, based on the stimulation given by others, Mr. Wu decided to abandon production with greater profits and start working on green gas and light gas. It is said that light gas is an important raw material for explosives and a necessity for national defense, but in the process of undertaking</p>

<h3 id="e196">My Thoughts on the National Goods Company <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>The Chinese National Goods Company of the Mainland Business District opened today. I had just returned to Shanghai from Wuxi, and because I wasn't very clear on the specific details, I thought it was some kind of joint organization of the Nine Factories. It wasn't until January 6th that I learned the goods sold weren't limited to the Nine Factories. Any product produced by a national goods factory is welcome to be sent for display and consignment. Therefore, I quickly sent various products of the "Invincible" brand to participate, and I have a few thoughts as follows:</p>
<p>From the manufacturer's perspective, there has always been a perceived difficulty in display and distribution. Setting up one's own store often feels monotonous because the items sold are too limited, not as diverse as a small department store. So, it often amounts to nothing. As a result, there are more stores opening than buyers, and even covering rent and food expenses with both principal and interest is insufficient, inevitably leading to closure. Regarding pricing, it is even more challenging. Clearly, a one-dollar item, wholesaled to other businesses, is only a few cents or fractions of a cent, but in one's own retail store, it's impossible to sell it at the wholesale price. Otherwise, the retailer would have no profit, and would demand a discount, shaking the original established position. However, from the retailer's perspective, there's room for flexibility. For example, during a big sale, they often deliberately sacrifice a bit on a popular and valuable item to attract customers, and then make a substantial profit on other goods to compensate. Under such circumstances, the price of the same item sold in one's own store must not be lower than the general reduced price, which will cause buyers to question, thinking that the factory's goods are more expensive than elsewhere. This will be spread by word of mouth, and will instead harm the buyer's goodwill, creating a reverse advertisement. Now that there is a National Goods Company that can handle the display and distribution, it can avoid setting up one's own retail store. This is a great convenience for us manufacturers. I hope that manufacturers everywhere quickly send all of their products to the company for consignment, as boldly as possible. In any case, the effectiveness of this kind of physical advertisement must be greater than any other form of advertising. And from the buyer's perspective, they will feel that everything is available, without the regret of something missing. For example, if a buyer comes in wanting to buy a certain product of brand A, but it is not available, they will reluctantly try and buy the same product of brand B. If the brand B product is indeed good, the buyer's trust will naturally shift from A to B, and they will definitely choose B over A in the future. This kind of shift in trust, with one gain and one loss on both sides of A and B, has a significant impact on the future of the business. So, I think that any manufacturer who has a product must not lag behind and fail to join. For the National Goods Company, seeking to promote national goods as its goal, universally soliciting products is also a very important task, because no matter how much or little business a buyer does, all expenses add up. If someone comes specifically to buy a certain item, but searches the entire place and can't find it, they will naturally not bother asking, and leave disappointed, blaming themselves for going to the wrong place, and not coming back again. Then business will gradually become slow, and from where will the expenses come? So I think the company must solicit universally. If there are well-known and popular national goods that are not immediately available, they should buy a small amount with cash to meet the needs of buyers, so that they won't leave disappointed. I think that buying goods with cash will definitely get extra discounts. The company gets extra discounts, and buyers can also get extra discounts. This is a natural public principle. I hope that the same product is not limited to being sold by the same merchant. Even if the price varies, the buyer's result will be cheaper compared to buying it elsewhere. Then word of mouth will spread, and even if the threshold of the National Goods Company is made of steel, it will be worn down!</p>

<h3 id="e197">The Spirit That Those Engaged in the National Goods Business Should Possess <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Chi Junzong is one of the founders of the Tongcheng Textile Company. He had many plans for the establishment of the company. Recently, Chi Jun spoke at the China National Goods Production and Sales Cooperative Association on [The Spirit That Those Engaged in the National Goods Business Should Possess]. His words were long and heartfelt, with unique insights. I recorded them here as a motto for those engaged in industry (Guangqian Record).</p>
<p>The factory I run deals with fly waste. It was only ten years ago that factories began to engage in this business. The raw materials are the waste from cotton yarn factories, such as fly waste and oil waste. Ten years ago, ordinary yarn factories did not know how to use the fly waste and sold it to foreign merchants to be shipped abroad, spun into yarn, and woven into cloth before being sold back to China, resulting in countless outflows of profits. Later, the Shanghai Minsheng Yarn Factory, in light of this, took the initiative to launch this industry, and our factory followed suit. We purchased machines from Germany to start the business. I was not originally involved in industry, but as a representative of the bank, I held the position of deputy manager. At that time, spinning yarn from oil waste did not yield good results. In addition, the Qilu War in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China caused business to be sluggish and sales to be stagnant, and the capital turnover was not smooth, leading to a sudden failure. The following year, we reopened the factory, determined to reorganize, and actually spun the yarn and built the new factory building. Everything progressed quite smoothly. Unexpectedly, the revolutionary army rose in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, causing temporary chaos and almost undoing all previous efforts. After some reorganization, we were able to slightly restore the old appearance. At that time, we only knew how to manufacture scarves, Luzon hats, and socks, but I always wanted to make the most of the materials and make cloth. Later, I went to a foreign firm and bought a machine to study how to make wool. At first, the wool we made was of poor quality and unsightly. After exhausting our efforts and working hard to study, we were able to make wearable wool. Gradually, we were able to manufacture flannel and felt. Now, all of our products have suitable patterns and are available in all colors, which was beyond our imagination when we first started. During the research and manufacturing process, we encountered many difficulties due to insufficient capital. Fortunately, we were given a lot of care by all sectors, which enabled us to achieve success. We encountered a setback when manufacturing military felt. At that time, the Ministry of Military Affairs did not believe that the military felt made by the Chinese themselves was sufficient for use. Later, the Commodity Inspection Bureau conducted a chemical test, and the results showed that our products were excellent, pure in texture, and free of oil, surpassing imported products. At this point, the authorities began to believe that the national goods industry had made great progress, and our products also gained a good reputation as a result. As for the flannel we make, a certain foreigner told me that it was on par with Japanese goods. This may be an exaggeration, but it is a happy and satisfying thing that waste materials can now be utilized.</p>
<p>However, I still have something to regret. In the ten years of operation, we have only made two products, flannel and felt. Therefore, I have the following feelings:</p>
<p>(1) Those engaged in national goods are bound to fail at first, and must try again after failure. Looking at Liu Bang in Chinese history, he was defeated and fought repeatedly, and finally defeated the Chu tyrant and established the world. Those engaged in national goods should have this "tumbler" spirit. After falling, come again, and come even more after falling. Never give up, never give up, and eventually there will be a day of success. However, the business can fail, but the personality cannot fail, because personality is the soul of the business. Once the personality is gone, even if there is a way to turn the tide, the business will never have hope of success.</p>
<p>(2) Chinese people often have the three words "almost there" in their minds, and these three words are the enemy of success. Every time, a small difference leads to a big mistake. Those who run industries must not have the "almost there" mentality. Every matter and every thing should be carefully investigated step by step. When problems arise, they should not be tired of details, and they should study them carefully from a long-term perspective. This is not only the capital for success, but also a way to prevent the source of failure. (3) Those who run industries must not be afraid of trouble. If a factory is afraid of trouble and wants to achieve quick success and simplicity in everything, there will be big problems. Therefore, those who run industries should not only not be afraid of trouble, but also look for troublesome things to do. The more troublesome, the more they should study and do it, because the more you are afraid of trouble, the more trouble will find you, and the more troublesome things will become. Troublesome things, if done at the beginning, will no longer be troublesome, and if not done, they will become lifelong troubles. Clearly, those who run factories will not encounter any problems.</p>
<p>(4) Those who run industries should learn from the spirit of [Tang Seng's journey to obtain scriptures], gather talents widely, and work together in harmony. A person like Tang Seng, who is so gentle and refined and likely to fall over in the wind, went to Tibet to obtain scriptures. The journey was long and full of monsters, which was originally an impossible task. However, because he had Sun Wukong, Zhu Bajie, and Sha Monk following him, working together with one heart and one mind, and faithfully protecting him along the way, he finally achieved his goal. Running a factory is like Tang Seng going to Tibet to obtain scriptures because of a difficult task, but if there are talents like Sun Wukong, Zhu Bajie, and Sha Monk who join in, work hard and willingly, and do things loyally and courageously, there will be achievements.</p>
<p>(5) Those engaged in the national goods business must have the greatest determination. Chinese people often say: [Nothing is difficult in the world, only those who are afraid of having a heart], and also say: [Where the spirit reaches, metal and stone will open]. Those engaged in the national goods business must have this determination to fight, and always keep national goods in mind, and then they can make national goods, make good national goods, and make national goods that are happy to use. (6) Now, foreign-run businesses have sophisticated technology, good management, and strong capital. Those engaged in the national goods business must have some courage to compete with them. Hundreds of years ago, there was a business group in Europe who felt that the sun was very annoying and vowed to invent something to cover it. China also had the story of [Yugong removing mountains]. These things seem very absurd, but those who run national goods factories should have this courage. If they can't do it well in their own lives, let their children and grandchildren do it, and there will be a day of success. If you want to calculate when it will definitely succeed, this matter will never succeed.</p>
<p>In peacetime, it can manufacture salt and nitrate (for fertilizing fields). The machines can also manufacture Methanal (gasoline substitute), and will not lose sales because there is no war.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in the Americas, because of the continuous years of war and banditry in the country, mostly have a "enjoy here, don't think about tomorrow" mentality abroad. Although everyone is very sympathetic to investing in and developing industries in the motherland, they are given a very bad impression because of the dangers of kidnapping, etc., and the fact that overseas Chinese have invested heavily in several businesses in the past, and the results have been disastrous. Mr. Wu solemnly said to the reporter, "If we want overseas Chinese to return to the country to serve the country's production sector, our business can only succeed in the future, and there can be no more failures. This is the only way to establish credibility." Finally, talking about recent events in Japan, we can learn from them and tell us a shocking message!</p>
<p>[In this Shanghai battle, Japan also felt that the aircraft shell picric acid was not good, and decided to change to a mixture of perchlorate NH6CIO4 and wood chips, heavy oil ferrosilicon FeSi; now, in order to encourage the people to manufacture, the government pays 1,200 yuan for items with a cost of 350 yuan per ton, and many factories are working day and night to manufacture them. (Note: ferrosilicon Ees, with Therneal properties, can start fires.)]</p>
<p>This is indeed the ambition of the aggressor, but what about us who are being invaded? Are we just waiting to die? Our conversation stopped at this time, but this deep impression still lingered in my mind.</p>

<p>— Yinge</p>
<p>What is trench life like? The military uniform you wear is naturally unchangeable and is made of dirty wool, as filthy, damp, and cold as possible, and you must endure it. The coarse food and cold dishes you eat are enough to fill you up. You can't sleep soundly day and night, or because you are extremely tired, you fall asleep leaning on the mud bed, only to be awakened again by the sound of artillery and bombs.</p>
<p>The small room supported by wood or iron sheets, the small room protected by mud and sandbags, is constantly destroyed by artillery shells or bombs. The rumbling of artillery and bombs, and the rustling falling of mud, are the only decorations in the trenches.</p>
<p>You don't want to use national goods, saying that this thing is not good to wear, not good to eat, and not comfortable to use. You must say that imported goods are good, and even say that Japanese goods are good. Think about what life is like for patriotic soldiers in the trenches? To be honest, there are all kinds of national goods to wear, eat, and use, but they are indeed not as beautiful and comfortable as foreign goods. But if we can often think of the food, clothing, and shelter in the trenches, then it doesn't matter if it's not beautiful or comfortable!</p>

<p>— Ge</p>
<p>In the second year of Guangxu, Li Xiaochi of Jiangning went to the United States to participate in the Centennial Exposition of the founding of the United States, and returned to write a book called [A New Record of Traveling Around the Earth]. Li Hefei wrote a preface to it. The book was written 57 years ago. At that time, Taiwan and Penghu had not been ceded, and the Three Han were still there. China's national power was still above Japan, but in the past 50 years, Japan has become stronger and we have become weaker. In Mr. Li's book, there are already signs of this. Now I list a few sections for those who discuss the world to examine.</p>
<p>[The place where Japan displays things is more than twice as large as China, and the location is also very well-organized, and the cabinets are all Western-style. ··· On the beams hangs the woolen department of the China National Goods Company</p>
<p>The gold-painted plaque is inscribed with the four characters "Imperial Japan" in large letters, and the door is covered with red heart flags. The officials in charge of the association are all dressed in Western style. ···</p>
<p>Observing its country's recent systems and arts and crafts, it is able to carefully explore its profoundness. Such as excavating metal and coal mines to enrich the country, changing the army and politics to strengthen the army, establishing machine bureaus, money-making bureaus, and steamship bureaus to benefit the country and the people, and enlisting and employing all those who are interested in foreign affairs or who can create foreign languages ​​and characters. ··· All this is like lifting heavy things lightly, which is because they are chivalrous, compete for ingenuity, and are unwilling to confine themselves to laziness.</p>
<p>[There is a farming institute in the north corner of the assembly base ··· Agricultural tools are all modern American methods. ··· Japan has now purchased eighteen</p>
<h3 id="e200">How National Goods Should Seek a Way Out Under Heavy Pressure (4) <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Du Chongyuan</p>
<p>Regarding the vertical aspect: 1. Restricting imports, 2. Abolishing all exorbitant taxes, 3. Transportation without obstacles: 4. Government assistance. The first three are what our government has been striving for day and night, but have not yet been realized. If our domestic politics continue to be so chaotic, then at least in the short term, they cannot be realized. As for the last point, if politics is on the right track, there is no problem, but under this kind of situation, it is not absolutely impossible. To remedy the above points, we can only do it ourselves. How to do it? First, use propaganda methods to arouse the concept of people happily using national goods. In recent years, domestic industrial products have made rapid progress. All products can indeed be compared with imported products, and some have even surpassed foreign products, but because the Chinese people have been surrounded by foreign goods for a long time, they have a despicable traditional concept and always doubt that national goods cannot catch up with foreign goods. Even better national goods are often mistaken for foreign goods. If the national goods factory industry can use propaganda, on the one hand, inform the people of the crisis of foreign economic invasion in China: on the other hand, clarify the national duty of using national goods, and sincerely promote it to the people in the way of evangelism. At the same time, national goods display places should be set up in all commercial ports and cities and towns to arouse the people's interest and recognition of using national goods. It is even more regrettable that all public entertainment is held in national goods display places, improving all bad habits of the people, and instilling new knowledge in the people, so that the people develop a sense of conscience and disgust for foreign goods and reject them unanimously. If this is done conscientiously, then this power is indeed very great. Secondly, the production sector and the consumer sector should work together to abolish exorbitant taxes in order to reduce the cost of the production sector, which indirectly reduces the burden on consumers. Thirdly, in terms of transportation, we should now choose places that foreign goods can reach as the first step in promoting national goods, and it is not very difficult to gradually enter towns and villages.</p>
<h3 id="e201">The Russian People's Love for National Goods <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Mingfeng</p>
<p>Kunshan Zhou Tongqing returned to China from his country via Europe and stayed briefly in Moscow. According to him, the Russians use all national goods. The magnetic basin used in the hotel is not very good in quality, but it is all national goods. The Russian paper-making industry has not yet developed, and the paper produced is not enough to meet the demand. Therefore, the paper used for invoices issued by stores is almost equivalent to Chinese rough paper. Mr. Zhou even brought one back to China as a souvenir. I wonder what the Chinese who love imported goods think about this?</p>
<p>Russian customs are extremely strict. If you have not purchased Russian goods, you cannot seek sales in Russia. And you must use goods of equal price to offset each other.</p>
<p>Our country's customs cannot be completely autonomous. However, if everyone can check themselves, if they cannot produce export goods, they will never use imported goods, then imported goods will inevitably be sharply reduced. For example, most ordinary people cannot produce or sell goods overseas, then they have no right to purchase foreign goods. I often see people who cannot earnestly study and focus on production, and they are happy to buy foreign goods and claim to be open-minded. This kind of person is the root of national destruction and family ruin.</p>

<p>[The Daxiaodunfang (ie, schools), post offices, telegraph bureaus, mining bureaus, and shipping companies are all established in accordance with Western methods, and officials are appointed as managers, which is almost everywhere in the country. And they pay special attention to the two ends of telegraph and post, which can almost be compared with the West.]</p>
<p>The above is the text of 57 years ago. Mr. Li Xiaochi's feelings at the American Exposition seem to have nothing to do with national goods. However, the Japanese are determined to reform and can put all their efforts into the exposition. This kind of spirit can give the Chinese people a kind of stimulus.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Sales Problems Under Scientific Management <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Shouzhong's Speech at Qiacheng Ji</p>
<p>First: The national goods business community should have a kind of union. The benefits of union are of course well known to all of you, and there is no need to repeat them; the merger of Mr. Liu Hongsheng's match and enamel factory and the merger of Kangyuan Canning Factory and other canning factories are enough to prove the trend and need for union. As for the method of union, there are two types, one is the union of the same industry, and the other is the union of various industries: after the union, the following important work can be done:</p>
<p>(1) Research work: study how to classify, because after classification can you understand what goods to send to where to sell, special to special, ordinary to ordinary, sales can be convenient, and the sales channels of our current business community seem to have gone wrong, and they have suffered a lot. Regarding this issue, I will do another article to discuss it, and I will not repeat it now.</p>
<p>(2) After the same industry is united, all aspects of sales, advertising, and purchasing raw materials can be carried out jointly, and manpower and financial resources will be more economical at the same time. Second: China's current market organization is not very sound. Financial institutions and industry and commerce lack contact, which affects the sales of national goods. Mr. Yang has advocated on this issue in the National Goods Weekly of Shen Bao, and I am very much in favor of it. Secondly, China does not have wholesalers now, and even if there are a few, they are not sound. According to the statistics of the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau, there are very few factories with more than 5,000 people, and there are many small factories; the capital of these many small factories is not very sufficient. If the wholesalers are sound, with the help of warehouses and finance, it will be a great help to these many small factories. They can completely hand over the responsibility of sales to the wholesalers, because most small factories are managed by one person, from purchasing raw materials to sales, they are all responsible by one person, and their energy is limited, so they must divide and cooperate, and small factories specialize in manufacturing, and wholesalers preside over sales, which is beneficial to both production and sales. I still ask all of you present today to discuss this idea in detail.</p>
<p>Third: Regarding the purchase of raw materials, the current manufacturers mostly buy from merchants and brokers. In fact, the sellers get very little, but the intermediaries get a lot of profit; we understand that most of the consumers of Chinese national goods are farmers. If we want to increase production, we must increase their consumption. In order to reduce the exploitation of the middleman and take care of the economy of the farmers, we should help them organize production and sales cooperation.</p>
<p>Fourth: Organize production and sales cooperative chain stores; recently, Shanghai is preparing to set up a national goods company, and I hope that it can take on this mission, that is, take the company in Shanghai as the starting point and form a chain of stores with companies in various places, and let this chain of stores be responsible for sales, customs declaration, and distribution.</p>

<h3 id="e203">Important News: Cheng Tianfang Resigns as Director of the Hubei Education Department <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday Summoned to Gan by Zhuang and Jiang</p>
<p>(Hangzhou, 8th Telegram) Cheng Tianfang, President of National Zhejiang University, was summoned by Chairman Jiang by telegram for consultation and set off for Gan on the morning of the 9th. He is scheduled to return to Hangzhou in a week. The school affairs are handled by Secretary-General Shen. Also, Cheng expressed his refusal to take the newly announced position of Director of the Hubei Education Department.</p>
<p>Also, a reporter quoted Cheng Tianfang, President of Zhejiang University, as saying that he had not heard anything about the transfer to Hubei before. He suffers from insomnia and is currently in Hangzhou to recuperate. The reorganization of Zhejiang University has just begun, and he is unwilling to leave halfway. He has resigned to the Executive Yuan and then showed the telegram to the Executive Yuan, which is transcribed as follows: Nanjing Executive Yuan Jian, I have read the report that the Eighty-Sixth Meeting of the Executive Yuan resolved to appoint Cheng Tianfang as a member of the Hubei Provincial Government and Director of the Education Department, etc. I thought that Tianfang had once been appointed as Director of the Jiangsu Education Department in the winter of the year before last. At that time, he begged to resign due to illness. Fortunately, he was appreciated for his foolishness and sincerely approved it. After recuperating by West Lake last spring, the Executive Yuan entrusted him with the position of President of National Zhejiang University. He also resigned when the decree was first issued. Later, because the university is not an administrative agency and the affairs are relatively simple, and he is in Hangzhou, or it does not violate the original intention of recuperating, he took office in April. Since taking office, it has been ten months in an instant. The reorganization of Zhejiang University is in progress, and personal health has temporarily recovered. If I leave Zhejiang for Hubei at this time, it will be inconvenient for both public and private matters. After repeated deliberation, I can only resign from the new appointment and beg you to approve the resignation and appoint another capable person to take over. I am very grateful to Cheng Tianfang, Geng Kou,</p>

<p>Education Fund Management Office Urges Payment of Funds</p>
<p>Insufficient Funds for the Second Half of October</p>
<p>Although the payment notice for October for the provincial schools and social education institutions in Jiangsu Province has been received, at the end of the lunar year, each school only received half a month's payment. According to the usual practice, the counties in the lunar year have good harvests and there is more hope, but it is said that it has been affected by heavy snow and frozen rivers. For the first half of November, some schools received the full amount of the payment notice from the counties, while others only received half or several tenths. On average, they have received 70% to 80%. In addition, there are expenses for studying abroad in the East and West, about 30,000 yuan for the winter months (October, November, December), which has not been received yet. The reasons for the lack of funds are: first, the Finance Department has not paid the education funds from the counties and the provincial subsidies owed in the past; second, it is difficult for people to enter the city to complete and pay the grain due to the frozen rivers; and third, the Education Fund Management Office borrowed 200,000 yuan from the Jiangsu China Communications Bank, which was originally agreed to repay 100,000 yuan at the end of December and 100,000 yuan at the end of January. Later, because it could not be done on time, it was extended to repay 100,000 yuan at the end of January and 100,000 yuan at the end of February. It is said that 88,000 yuan of the 100,000 yuan at the end of January has been repaid. Currently, the balance in each bank is different, ranging from several thousand yuan. Recently, the frozen river has thawed, and the Management Office sent staff member Ni Dongfu to Yixing to urge the payment of funds (Yixing recently owes 20,000 to 30,000 yuan) and ordered each county or finance bureau that owes education funds to pay quickly in order to pay the insufficient funds for the second half of October for the provincial schools and the expenses for studying abroad, it is said.</p>

<p>| Lecture given at the Shanghai YMCA on the evening of the 7th of this month |</p>
<p>An Overview of School and Social Education</p>
<p>The YMCA invited Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Shanghai Education Bureau, to give a lecture entitled "Education in Shanghai" at 9:15 PM the night before last (the 7th). Xie Fusheng translated. Although the content mainly consisted of statistical data, the audience did not feel bored, as they were all interested in education. Therefore, the lecture ended at 11:00 PM before the audience dispersed. Reporters from foreign newspapers such as the North-China Daily News and the China Press were also present to record the lecture. It is reported that the YMCA invited Mayor Wu to give a lecture on "The Municipality of Greater Shanghai" in December. Director Pan's lecture the night before last was essentially a part of "The Municipality of Greater Shanghai." In the future, the YMCA will continue to invite directors from various bureaus of the Municipal Government to give lectures. The record of Director Pan's speech is as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>
<p>We are currently in a time of national crisis. There are undoubtedly many important issues that are attracting public attention. However, I am grateful to the YMCA for giving me this wonderful opportunity to give a seemingly dry and uninteresting talk about education before you tonight. I feel ashamed and deeply grateful. I believe that you all have unlimited sympathy for the future of China and firmly believe that China's only hope lies in the universal education of the Chinese people. Shanghai has naturally become an important hub in China's overall improvement plan and will continue to shoulder the task of influencing and promoting progress in other parts of the country.</p>
<p>Speaking of Shanghai, since its opening as a trading port in 1843, it has made rapid progress. Now, Shanghai accounts for 40% of China's import and export trade. Moreover, due to the development of Shanghai's education, it has also formed a cultural center. In July 1917 (the 16th year of the Republic of China), the Shanghai Special Municipal Government was established, with a status equal to that of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, directly under the Central Government. The seventeen rural towns previously under the jurisdiction of Shanghai and Baoshan counties, including famous locations during last year's Songhu War of Resistance against Japan such as Zhabei, Wusong, Jiangwan, and Zhenru, were all placed under the jurisdiction of the Special Municipality. In July 1930 (the 19th year of the Republic of China), it was reorganized in accordance with the newly promulgated Municipal Organization Law and renamed Shanghai Municipality. The department under the Municipal Government in charge of education is the Shanghai Education Bureau, which I currently oversee. You can imagine that for a city with a population of 3.5 million, the taxes available for education are very limited, especially after the Shanghai War. With such a stretched-thin Education Bureau, how much of the work that should be done for the citizens of Greater Shanghai has actually been accomplished is self-evident.</p>
<p>In China, or on a smaller scale, in Shanghai alone, the development of education has not been based on a comprehensive plan. Therefore, upon investigating the history of various educational institutions, no consistent patterns have been found. Regardless of the size of the school, its establishment and operation are all independent. How to cooperate with each other depends on the appropriate opportunity. The sprout of new education in China is a reaction to the opening of the country to the outside world and contact with foreigners in the last hundred years. Knowing this, the unevenness and lack of coordination in education are not surprising. I would like to briefly describe the state of education in Shanghai within the time allotted, based on this point. Please forgive me for not understanding why the YMCA chose 9:15 PM as the lecture time. I'm afraid it will be close to 11:00 PM when I finish speaking. By then, everyone will be eager to go home and sing "Returning Home." There is no need to give such a bland lecture. However, this time is a fixed tradition, and traditions cannot be broken. I should stop talking nonsense and quickly summarize what I want to say into two sections:</p>
<p>1) An Overview of School Education | From elementary education to university.</p>
<p>2) An Overview of Social Education.</p>
<p>I hope to finish what I want to say within an hour, as the translation will also take the same amount of time. Due to the nature of the topic, I will inevitably use some statistical figures. Listening to numbers is like chewing wax. Please forgive me.</p>
<p>Let me first talk about school education. This includes elementary schools, middle schools, independent colleges, universities, kindergartens, and vocational schools. To understand the present, we must briefly describe the past.</p>
<p>The earliest elementary school was the Meixi Academy, established in 1878 (the fourth year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty). The Yangzheng Academy was established in 1930. Jingye was founded by Magistrate Wang Maokun. The other two schools were initially founded by private individuals.</p>
<p>Among the middle schools, the earliest were the Binggong Middle School, established in 1863, the Xuhui Public School founded by the French Catholic Church, the Qingxin Middle School founded by the American Presbyterian Church, the Private Nanyang Middle School, and the Private YMCA Middle School. Other middle schools, such as Minli, Pudong, Chengzhong, and Mailun, were also established one after another.</p>
<p>The earliest normal school was the Normal College of Nanyang Public School in 1897. In 1904, Circuit Intendant Yuan Shuxun changed the Longmen Academy into the Longmen Normal School. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, normal training centers were established one after another, and then they were successively closed down. Only the one attached to the Wuben Women's School continued uninterrupted. After the establishment of the Republic of China, Longmen Normal School was renamed Jiangsu Provincial Second Normal School. In 1930, the Municipal Government established Xinlu Normal School as the most recently established normal school.</p>
<p>The formal vocational school was established by the China Vocational Education Society in 1918, starting with the China Vocational School.</p>
<p>The first formal kindergarten was not established until the establishment of the Municipal First Kindergarten in 1929, as kindergartens were previously attached to various elementary schools.</p>
<p>The above is just a brief overview of the history of primary and secondary schools in Shanghai. Now, I will briefly talk about the Shanghai Municipal Government's education funding, because the amount of funding is directly proportional to the success of the cause. Before the establishment of the Municipal Government, Shanghai's education funding was not fixed, mostly relying on land tax and a portion of house tax and miscellaneous taxes. In the event of a disaster or poor harvest, education funding would suffer. After the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Government in 1927, the financial system implemented unified revenue and expenditure, which was a welcome reform. Education funding was stipulated to be 25% of the city's available revenue. According to the 1931 budget (from July 1931 to June 1932), although education funding did not reach 25% of the total revenue, it accounted for more than 1.2%. Now, if we compare the funding for 1927-1928 and 1931-1932, we can see the year-by-year progress of the education cause run by the Municipal Government.</p>
<p>1927-1928 1931-1932 Increase</p>
<p>Administrative Expenses 41,910.13 142,387.07 100,476.94</p>

It is also learned that since the committee widely solicited publications from various bookstores, within a week, bookstores from all over the country have been sending donations. Since the day before yesterday, a large number of publications donated by local bookstores such as Commercial Press, China Book Company, Pacific Bookstore, and Huiwentang have been received. Many other magazine publishers have also replied, promising to send donations regularly on a yearly basis. Now, a second batch of hundreds of solicitation letters has been sent to party departments, agencies, organizations, and universities at all levels across the country to solicit publications. Therefore, the staff of the committee have been working day and night, advancing with writing, and handling hundreds of documents every day. The original letter from the committee urging sponsors to pay donations is copied below: Respectfully, we believe that culture is the life of the nation, and the teachings of the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen are the foundation of the new cultural movement in our country, which urgently needs to be promoted and developed. Therefore, at the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee, the establishment of the Sun Yat-sen Cultural Education Center was proposed. We are grateful to you for your initial support and signing as a sponsor. Your enthusiasm for culture is deeply appreciated. A preparatory committee has now been established at No. 10 Molier Road, Shanghai, to begin preparations, and it is expected to be officially established within two months. During this preparatory period, all facilities require funding, and the establishment fee urgently needs to be collected. According to the regulations, sponsors should donate an establishment fee of more than 500 yuan. We dare to write to you requesting that you immediately pay the donated establishment fee to the Shanghai Central China Communications National Overseas Chinese Shanghai Six Banks for collection and use.

<p>| Welcome Telegram from New York, USA |</p>
<p>Ninety-Four-Year-Old Man Expresses Earnest Opinions</p>
<p>Women's Bank Takes the Lead in Providing Assistance</p>
<p>The news of the Liangjiang Women's Basketball Team's tour of Europe and America was briefly reported in yesterday's newspaper. The team is currently actively preparing, and a preparatory committee has been established at Room 207, Women's Bank Building, Nanjing Road, Shanghai. The office was donated by Ms. Yan Shuhe, the president of the Shanghai Women's Bank, who is the first person in the domestic women's community to actually support the team. Furthermore, it has been learned that the Amateur Athletic Union of America in New York has sent a welcome telegram. The telegram was sent by Mr. Shen Siliang, the chief executive of the Chinese National Amateur Athletic Federation, and forwarded to Liangjiang. The translated text of the telegram is as follows: "The Amateur Athletic Union of America welcomes the Liangjiang Women's Basketball Team from your country to the United States. We will invite various teams to compete around mid-March to seek guidance. Please indicate the date of departure as soon as possible. Amateur Athletic Union of America, New York."</p>
<p>In addition, Ma Xiangbo, a 94-year-old veteran of education, has always advocated sports and is very enthusiastic about it. He has expressed very sincere opinions on the Liangjiang Women's Basketball Team's trip to Europe and America, hoping to awaken the Chinese people's joint efforts to help the team succeed. His words are as follows:</p>
<p>"In this time of national crisis, if we want to become strong, we must first promote women's sports. Recently, we have heard daily news about the new records in global aviation created by Europe and the United States. However, our women's community has only a few aviators. Compared with the great powers, we are still in our infancy. Now, the basketball team of our school, Liangjiang Women's Physical Education College, is planning to tour Europe and America to visit other countries and learn from advanced countries in order to promote progress in the sports community in the future. Last time, they conquered Japan in the East and returned triumphantly, which was highly praised by society. This time's plan has also received enthusiastic support from Mayor Wu of the Shanghai Municipal Government, which is admirable. Now, the Amateur Athletic Union of America in New York has sent a welcome telegram. I believe that this is also a way for the people to strive for self-improvement. I agree with the plan of Principal Lu of our school and hope that the Chinese people will jointly support it, establish the foundation for self-improvement, and be the pioneers for men."</p>
<p>Young Heroes Like Bamboo Shoots After Rain: The World of Tennis in 1933</p>
<p>America, Australia, Germany, France, South Africa, Spain</p>
<p>New Youngsters Create Amazing Results</p>
<p>Progress is Faster Than Expected</p>
<h3 id="e216">France to Employ New Players to Retain the Davis Cup <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>British tennis expert W. Myers discusses the world of tennis in 1933: "Looking around the world, in 1933, the brilliance of male and female tennis stars will be even more dazzling. It is unpredictable that someone like Vines will jump into the center court of Wimbledon and win the championship. At the very least, it will refresh the audience and amaze everyone. In the recent year, young heroes have emerged all over the world like bamboo shoots after rain. Their progress is faster than expected."</p>
<h3 id="e217">Australian McGrath <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>"The two young people from Australia and South Africa must be discussed first. Australia's V. McGrath is only seventeen years old. During the American tennis team's tour of Australia, he first defeated Allison and then Crawford. In the Australian Championships, he defeated Vines again. Vines's record of victory was 6-2, 2-6, 8-6, 7-5. Vines only won the second set, and the intensity of the competition can be imagined. However, he eventually lost to his compatriot Crawford. McGrath's skills must be as brave as he is. His two-handed backhand is even more accurate."</p>
<h3 id="e218">South African Bertram <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>"South Africa's M. Bertram from Johannesburg is slightly older than McGrath, but he is still new in the eyes of the world. He was a finalist in the South African Championships. As a talented tennis player, he has defeated South African stars Kerbell, Robbins, and Chenghasen. His movements are agile, and he is capable of everything. However, he recently lost to the Englishman Lee."</p>
<h3 id="e219">Two North American Youths <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>"Speaking of the United States, the most interesting are two. 1) O. Sutter, the All-American Collegiate Champion, will tour Europe this month and may reach southern France. Last year, he twice soundly defeated Austin. In the All-American Championships, he lost to Vines in a five-set battle. Vines was shocked. Sutter has the confidence that a champion must have. His passing shots are even more confident. He is one of the most promising people this year."</p>
<p>"K. CledLill is Vines's doubles partner and the runner-up in the All-American doubles. Although they lost to Allison and Van Hui, they later won back. His doubles is better than his singles. K is especially popular. The audience in the stadium likes him very much. Wimbledon is probably no exception. K is currently touring Australia."</p>
<h3 id="e220">German Cramm <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>"The most improved player in Europe in 1932 was Germany's C. VonCramm. Vines, Shields, and Austin can all tell you about his abilities. If Cramm gets Froizheim's inheritance, he can turn defeat into victory. The ferocity of his smash makes his lob shots even more impressive."</p>
<h3 id="e221">Spanish Manuel <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>"Another rising star in Europe to remember is Spain's Maiej. Manuel belongs to the Spanish army and is a soldier. His special point is that he only needs a short period of practice. With a month of effort, he can win six games. He defeated Barracura at Wimbledon last year. His overhead smash is especially moving."</p>
<h3 id="e222">Two French Youths <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>"France's two youths, M. Bernard and A. erlinM, will definitely achieve amazing results. Bernard is a left-handed player and is only twenty years old. He only appeared on the international stage last year. At the French Tennis Open, he was invincible all the way, and only lost to Cochian in the final."</p>
<p>"Bernard's style is completely champion-like. His weakness is only that he is too conservative. Bernard and Bowsers have been practicing doubles all winter. In the Davis Cup, they may replace Cochian and Browny."</p>
<p>"Merlin is a student of Cochian. Merlin's characteristic is that his shots do not seem to have decisive power, but his fierce attack often defeats the enemy. He ranks fourth in France, behind Barracura. Merlin will be the one to watch. It is only said that Merlin is too eager to win, but this kind of forward courage is a commendable mistake."</p>
<h3 id="e223">France Will Use New Players <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>(Paris News) France has won the Davis Cup from the United States since 1927. Now it has been six years. In the past six years, the players have been only Cochian, Lacoste, Barracura, and Browny. This year, new players will be employed. In addition to Cochian, one or two new young people will be selected to challenge the United States or other countries. Two of the three musketeers may retire this fall to be spectators when they retain the Davis Cup. There may only be Cochian in the French team, but the French still remember Cochian's two defeats to Fan Enqi. Lacoste, who was originally planned to be reused last year, can no longer revive. Barracura has decided to retire. The new players to be used will be Bernard or Herlin. Bernard and Bowers have been practicing cooperation for some time, and may replace the Cochian Browny team. But in any case, France's lineup, as in last year, will be finalized at the last minute.</p>

<p>The second Group A match was between Mai Ling and Team Seven. The difference in strength was obvious. For the first five minutes, the situation seemed even, but Team Seven could not sustain the resistance, leading to an irreversible collapse. At halftime, Mai Ling had 33 points, and Team Seven had 12 points. In the second half, Team Seven scored seven points, becoming even more nervous and defensively strict.

<h3 id="e239">Wu Dialect becoming Northernized <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Due to the convenience of transportation, the Wu dialect also contains some Northernized phrases; however, they are very few, accounting for only one or two percent.</p>
<p>First, there is the character [上] (shàng, up). In the Suzhou dialect, the character [上] (shàng) in phrases like 上門 (shàng mén, go to the door), 上山 (shàng shān, go up the mountain), and 上樓 (shàng lóu, go upstairs) is pronounced as the departing tone of the character 撞 (zhuàng, collide). However, when saying [馬上就去] (mǎ shàng jiù qù, go immediately), not only is the character [上] (shàng) pronounced in the Northern way, but even the character [馬] (mǎ, horse) is pronounced in the Northern way.</p>
<p>Second, there is the character [下] (xià, down). The character [下] (xià) in phrases like 下山 (xià shān, go down the mountain) and 下樓 (xià lóu, go downstairs) is pronounced in the local dialect; however, when saying [下不過去] (xià bù guò qù, can't get by), this character [下] (xià) is pronounced in the Northern way, sounding like 諧駕切一 (xié jià qiē yī).</p>
<p>Third, there is the character [玉] (yù, jade). The Suzhou dialect pronounces the character [玉] (yù) as a checked tone; the Northern dialect lacks checked tones, so the character [玉] (yù) is pronounced similar to [御] (yù, imperial). When Suzhou people say [玉官要買玉麥丨卽珍珠米] (yù guān yào mǎi yù mài | jí zhēnzhū mǐ, jade official wants to buy jade corn | that is, pearl rice); the [玉] (yù) in 玉官 (yù guān, jade official) is pronounced with a checked tone, while the [玉] (yù) in 玉麥 (yù mài, jade corn) is pronounced like [御] (yù, imperial), so the name 御麥 (yù mài, imperial corn) is also Northernized.</p>
<p>Fourth, there is the character [黃] (huáng, yellow). Suzhou people pronounce the character [黃] (huáng) no differently from the character 王 (wáng, king); only the character [黃] (huáng) in 蟹黃 (xiè huáng, crab roe) and 蛋黃 (dànhuáng, egg yolk) is pronounced like the character 荒 (huāng, desolate), which is also Northernized.</p>
<p>The Northern and Southern dialects are vastly different, so Northern pronunciation in the Wu dialect is very rare; recently, there is a National Language course in elementary schools, which is truly a language that is neither Southern nor Northern; Southerners find it funny, and Northerners find it even funnier; no wonder there are some witty sayings in society, calling it: [Not afraid of heaven, not afraid of earth, only afraid of Suzhou people speaking Mandarin].</p>

<p>— Yong Zi</p>
<p>| Mr. Liao Zhai is the Saint of Lies |</p>
<p>There is a publicly recognized liar in America. It is said that recently, because he told a great lie that Americans consider unprecedented, the governor appointed him as the [Official Liar] and gave him an annual salary of one U.S. dollar to encourage him. The lie told by this [Official Liar] this time is: [He had seen a cat with a wooden prosthetic leg use the prosthetic leg to kill a mouse.] Although these words sound like a lie, to us Chinese people who are used to hearing lies, it is too bland to be worth mentioning. Unexpectedly, Americans, who are more advanced than China in everything, are so naive in their ability to hear lies.</p>
<p>The history of lying in our China, not to brag, not to lie, is even before the many years and eighty-one tribulations that Tang Sanzang experienced. Zhuge Liang borrowing the east wind is even later. If you have to say when there was already history, then it should probably be the Nuwa clan who refined stones to repair the sky. As for complete books of lies, such as "Records of Night Talks," and "What the Master Would Not Discuss," which one is not a complete compendium of lies with a beginning and an end? "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" is an even more popular and eternally immortal masterpiece of lies. It is a pity that Mr. Liao Zhai racked his brains and left such a great work of lies that moves the gods and darkens the sun and moon, only for the Chinese people who live by listening to lies to use as reading material for leisure after tea and wine. If Mr. Liao Zhai were born in America, I think the degree of Doctor of Lying would be no problem, of course, he would get it. If universities were to insert a subject of Lying, they would of course invite Mr. Liao Zhai to be a professor, and the annual salary would be tens of thousands of times more than that of the [Official Liar]. Now, if someone were to sort out all the books of lies in China, ask a few returned students to extract the essence, and compile a [Outline of Chinese Lies] to sell in America, not only can it prove that China has a cultural history of thousands of years, raise the status of China a little, but also make a fortune in foreign money, I think that would be a good deal that kills two birds with one stone.</p>

<p>| Panoramic View |</p>
<p>I remember one day, on a picture advertisement of a certain tobacco company, "Overseas Strange Tales," I saw a strange story, saying that there was a pair of twins, their father, grandfather, and maternal grandmother were also twins. I am now introducing you to a similar strange story for your after-dinner conversation.</p>
<p>Sun Zhilu of the Qing Dynasty, a native of Hangzhou, wrote "Second Shen Yelu," named "Second Shen" because the book was based on the period from the Ming Dynasty Hongwu Wushen to Chongzhen Renshen. One section recorded that:</p>
<p>[Yang Qi, a resident of Ningguo Prefecture, his wife, Yu Shi, married at the age of eight or more and became pregnant. She was very large. After giving birth, she gave birth to twins. Not long after, she became pregnant again and gave birth to twins again. From then on, she became pregnant in succession, from the age of sixteen to fifty-two, with a total of eighteen pregnancies. Each pregnancy was twins, all boys, with a total of thirty-six children, all of whom grew up and none of them died young. This woman also had no illness and lived to a ripe old age and died.</p>
<p>I think this Yu Shi is really a strange person, she would get pregnant eighteen times, and every time she gave birth, it was always two boys. Now, young mistresses can't even manage one child, and they are already complaining endlessly. Let's think about this Yu Shi, in the later pregnancies, when giving birth, the older ones were enough to help, so she wouldn't be too tired, but in the beginning, she had to take care of at least eight children. We really can't guess how she lived her life at that time, ha ha.]</p>
<p>The world now is fundamentally a contradictory world, so on the one hand, some people are calling for birth control, and on the other hand, most countries are drafting regulations to encourage childbirth. It is said that a wealthy man in the United States took out a sum of money as a bonus to reward the small family with the most children. There is a family where the couple already have twenty-five children of all sizes, and they have a good chance of winning the award, etc., but compared with Yang Qi's [thirty-six], it is like a great wizard seeing a small wizard, and is far behind.</p>

<p>| Deformed Relationship |</p>
<p>In this era, money and flesh have developed a close relationship like magnets and iron.</p>
<p>Having flesh without money leaves the flesh with no room to move. Having money without flesh does not reveal the miracle of money.</p>
<p>Rickshaw pullers do not suffer with their two legs, and they cannot eat fried dough sticks and sesame cakes. Prostitutes do not cater to patrons, and they will be whipped and scolded by their madams. Is this not flesh acting for money? Rich magnates hire a few foreign bodyguards, afraid that kidnappers will not retreat three houses. Originally, crime is punishable by death, but they are acquitted because of heavy bribes. Is this not money revealing its miracle?</p>
<p>[Face] is flesh, so money can make it show ... laughter. [Heart] is flesh, so money can make it produce sorrow, joy ... emotions. The flesh of all adults, gentlemen, fashionable men and women, peddlers ... has a close relationship with money.</p>
<p>Some people say, [In this day and age, the relationship between money and flesh is not worth making a fuss about.] But I think those traitors who fawn on the enemy for money, and the merchants who sell contraband goods for money, endanger the public for their own private interests. This kind of relationship between money and flesh cannot be regarded as a bland story!</p>
<p>In a deformed society, let money and flesh develop towards a deformed relationship!</p>

<h3 id="e246">Two Amazing Inventions in Military Weapons <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Shi</p>
<p>The effectiveness of searchlights in military affairs is extremely significant, which is generally known. However, the disadvantage of ordinary searchlights is that they are often exploited by the enemy during war, using the light to find the path, and instead become the target for enemy fire, so military strategists often consider this a regret in the practical use of searchlights. In 1927, the famous British scientist Mr. I. L. Baird, in view of this, spent years of hard work and painstaking research, and invented a non-light searchlight, English name Noctovihior. Its structure and form are no different from ordinary ones, but its light emission is not perceivable by ordinary human vision. Examining the principle of its invention, it purely adopts the red line Infra-recray in sunlight as the largest element. We people deeply know that the sunlight band includes seven colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet, and according to research by optical scientists, outside the violet light, there is also a kind of [ultraviolet rays], and outside the red light, there is a kind of [infrared rays]. Both of these types of light are not visible to ordinary people. Ultraviolet rays have a very strong chemical effect, which can treat diseases and can also identify the authenticity of goods. Recently, it has been discovered that ultraviolet rays have the effect of secret communication. Infrared rays have extremely strong light power, also known as heat rays. Its light wave is about one hundred and sixty times longer than the red light line. Mr. Pete installed a rubber light-gathering device in front of the searchlight, collecting various light rays, and only allowing infrared rays to be emitted. At the same time, he also used the efficiency of the photoelectric tube PhotoElectricCell to make the object being shot appear in our eyes, without the slightest error. The invention of this searchlight has caused military scientists around the world to lose color in comparison. Recent test results show that the [transmittance] of its light is increased by more than three hundred times compared to ordinary searchlights, and it is not hindered by dim nights or heavy fog. When one side uses this light in combat, and at the same time supplements it with observation and aiming equipment, such as the latest invention of the electric linkage observation instrument; [Victor predictor] Vicdercpredictir and other items, it is enough to make bullets hit without fail, eliminating strong enemies invisibly.</p>
<p>Killer sonic waves can be called [dead sound]. This invention is based on Maxwell's killer rays [death rays]. It is like the invention of [television] after the invention of the telephone. According to the reason why our human ear organs can feel external sounds, the sound waves are transmitted to the eardrum and touched the auditory nerve through the vibration of the air. The difference in the frequency of sound wave vibrations distinguishes the clarity, lightness, and weight of the sound. Generally, musicians use the ratio of sound wave vibration frequencies and the arrangement of vibration numbers to develop the theory of tone intervals and scales. Acoustic scientists have studied the relationship between sound wave vibration frequency and hearing, and know that if the sound wave vibration number is less than sixteen times per second, the human ear cannot distinguish it, and the human ear cannot feel it if the vibration number is less than 40,000 times per second. The sensory power of the ear canal is limited, and sounds that are too fine or too loud cannot be heard. Due to the enlightenment of this kind of precedent, most scientists pay more attention to the realm of lower or higher vibration numbers, and think about exploring something. Most recently, two Americans, Hutter and Romis, were appointed as professors of experimental physics at Johns Hopkins University in the United States. They specialized in researching sound waves with the highest vibration frequency, namely [high-frequency sound waves], and empirically tested the potential and effectiveness of this high-frequency sound wave. After several experimental results, it was found that the possibility of killing people if the sound wave vibration number is more than 100,000 times per second. Therefore, Hulao and his colleagues [American United Electric Company] manufactured various experimental machines, and invented a death sound with a sound wave vibration number of more than 700,000 times per second. This kind of sound wave has the intensity of scorching heat and fierce combustion. No matter what kind of tough material, such as crystal, it will immediately become powder. There is also a kind of severe chemical reaction. Knives, such as mercury and water, absolutely cannot be chemically reacted at ordinary times, but through the strange effect of this kind of high-frequency sound wave, the two liquids are mixed to form [mercury mixture]. When human and other animal blood cells encounter this kind of sound wave, they are immediately destroyed and destroyed, and life is instantly cut off. Mr. Chen Gan's Qinghe Magazine, edited by the publishing industry, has been published in the sixth issue. The reviews include an article by Mr. Chen entitled Xigafeinanxia. Other works, such as Mr. Zheng Shuwen's Chronicle, Yao Ji's Legend, Xiang Lu Diary, and six kinds of celebrity notes, are quite valuable, and there are many textual research materials.</p>

<p>Yesterday's gold bar market initially fell, but eventually saw an upward trend. The opening price in the morning was 796.3 taels, as the London market saw a near-far contraction of 1.875, the British-American exchange rate fell by one cent, the American-British exchange rate fell by .75, and although the New York silver price was slightly higher at .375, the forward silver price contracted by only .022 and .015. In addition, American cotton continued to rise by 67 points. Although the opening price was not low, there was no sign of upward movement, and people's minds were not very stable. The exchange market opened without tension. The gold market was initially hesitant, fluctuating within six taels. When the spot American dollar opened at 8.1875 at the bank, there was a downstream market. March American dollars were at .25, and they could not be sold, so it fell to five taels. Anda came to plug in this month's American dollars at .3125, which fell to 793.7 taels. After that, it turned flat. HSBC's listings did not change. The gold market did not move, but the gold price gradually rose. After entering the market, the exchange market gradually tightened. Mitsui ate this month's American dollars at .125. There were rumors in the market that the Central Bank was coming to open spots, but the bottom was inherently lacking, and the amount was small, which turned people's hearts stable. It once soared to 799.2 taels, and then leveled off with the exchange market. Although it saw a decline, it was not violent. The banks' appetite was gradually showing signs of spitting out. The Zhengjin Bank sold April's American dollars at .375, and it reached seven taels. Finally, it entered a vortex, closing at 797.1 taels. During the half-day, it went from low to high, from high to flat, and the situation was hovering. Large households continued to drag in, and the red tape price had risen to 12 taels extra. Swap points were no longer seen to be moving forward into spot positions. Although the shorts offered high prices, it was not easy to get a formal opponent. Although the Central Bank came to absorb spot, the amount was not large. The half-day market situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e253">Previous Market <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>The morning opened at 796 taels and 8 mace, a slight increase of 5 mace compared to the previous close, but confidence remained unstable. Goods opened at 796 taels and 9 mace, and the price of gold also fluctuated, hovering around 6 taels and a half. When Bingxing came to sell, it was at 5 taels and a half. April US dollars were wanted by the bank at 8 yuan 375. Dadecheng initially advanced, still outside 6 taels, and Zhifengyong also purchased, at 6 taels and 4 mace. At this point, the market was calm, but confidence was slightly unstable, causing a slight decline. Fuchang Yuanheng came to sell off, as spot US dollars were offered at 1875 by the bank, and fell to around 5 taels. Furthermore, because no one was willing to buy March US dollars at 25, Yuanchun sold notes, lowering to within 5 taels. Fuyu made slight advances, fluctuating around 5 taels. Hengxing also advanced at this point, so the market temporarily stabilized. However, the exchange rate suddenly strengthened. May US dollars at half a yuan and March orders at 8125 were unwanted. Hengyu, Fuyu, Runchangyong, and others sold down to 4 taels. Anda offered this month's US dollars at 3125, and Fuchang also sold notes down to within 4 taels, at 93 taels and 7 mace. Yuanchun Qingfa Yong advanced to 4 taels and a half. At this time, the HSBC exchange rates were announced, and there were no changes in either British or US rates. Although there was no significant impact on the bid premium, the domestic market became tighter as a result. This month's US dollars at 25 were wanted for settlement by the bank. Hengyu Daxing Ruixing all advanced to 6 taels, and Fuyu advanced to 6 taels and a half. April at 375 was also wanted by the bank. Zhaofengchang advanced to outside 7 taels, and Daxing Hengyu, etc., advanced to 8 taels. There were no sellers for March US dollars at 25 and April at 3125, and the gold market became increasingly strong. In addition, there were rumors of the Central Bank opening spot transactions. Hengyu Runchang Yudadecheng, and others all purchased, causing the price to rise to 99 taels and 2 mace. Hongli came to sell, retreating to within 8 taels and a half. Although Dadecheng Qianchangxiang advanced, they could only temporarily hold the gold price. However, the bank gradually began to sell. April US dollars at 3125 were available for settlement, Yuanheng sold notes, at 7 taels and a half. Zhengjin sold off April US dollars at 375, Yuanmaoyong sold down to 6 taels and 6 mace. Brokers suddenly wanted May US dollars at 4375, Fuyu came to buy, and Jinfu Daxing Yong also advanced, stopping at 8 taels. Hongli sold notes, hovering between 7 taels and a half. Qianchangxiang Shunli came to sell, fluctuating down to 6 taels, and then back up. Qingfa advanced to 6 taels and a half. Dadecheng continued to advance, and Hengxing also acted as an agent for the Central Bank to open 70 notes, pulling the gold price to outside 7 taels. Before long, it closed at 797 taels and 1 mace. After the market closed, Dadecheng and others had a strong desire to buy, so goods were slightly raised, auctioned at 7 taels and a half. The highest price for the day was 799 taels and 2 mace, and the lowest was 793 taels and 7 mace, a fluctuation of 5 taels and a half. As a result, it closed up 8 mace from the previous close.</p>
<h3 id="e254">Declared Prices <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>Because the HSBC exchange rate for US dollars did not move, it was still calculated at 8 yuan. The combined bid gold price was 857 taels 1 mace 4 fen. Based on the closing price, it was about 60 taels lower, and due to the gold price rising 8 mace, it was also 8 mace less lower than the previous close. This month's registered price was 798 taels, March's was 797 taels, and the supplementary payment was 799 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e255">Transactions <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>Still active. Zhaofengchang, Dadecheng, Ruixing, Fuyu, Daxing, Yonghengxing, Zhifengyong Jinfu, Runchangyu, Ruikang, etc., all advanced. Yuanheng Bingxing, Hongli, Fuchang Yuanmaoyong Qianchangxiang, etc., all sold. Yuanchun and Yu sold first and then advanced. Daxingyong Qingfayong advanced first and then sold. There were no large-scale transactions from the Dalian or Guangdong groups.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>Yesterday's market was extremely quiet. Although prices rose, they were virtually unattainable. The market was merely a matter of colleagues dealing with each other, calculated at an additional 12 taels. Tongfengyong sold to Yingfeng Hengyiping, but this transaction was only to embellish the market. The silver shop group did not take action, and with few goods and high prices, both buying and selling were dull.</p>
<h3 id="e256">Swaps <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were no formal transactions, and no fixed premium was heard. No matter how high the premium offered by the shorts, there were no corresponding long positions, and no counterparty was found. Goods had a whole batch of short positions that had not been properly swapped. Efforts were made to find spot goods everywhere, but each spot merchant lacked inventory, so the spot goods were highly valued. The short positions swapped by Hengxing in the previous few days were also on behalf of a certain goods firm and have not yet been properly swapped. Many parties in the market declared their positions closed, so there were no transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e257">Exchange Rate Fluctuations <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to foreign news, London's main rates shrank by 1875, both near and far. British-US exchange rate fell by 1 cent, and US-British exchange rate dropped by 75. New York silver price fell by 375, and forward silver price was slightly lower, from 2.2% to 1.5%. Bank private telegrams only shrank by 1875. US cotton continued to rise to 78 pounds. People's hearts were confused. The exchange market opened slightly flat, with recent offers for British exchange at 1 shilling 7 pence 75, and US exchange at 28 yuan 1875. Initially, it was good, but then it suddenly weakened. This month's US dollars once reached 28 yuan 3125, hardening by 125 compared to the initial opening. Subsequently, the British and US exchange rates were not changed, although it did not affect the overall situation, the weakness had eased and turned into a positive aspect. Afterwards, it became increasingly tight. This month's US dollars suddenly traded at 28 yuan 125, tightening by 0625 compared to the initial opening, changing very rapidly. Finally, it was flat, and even the closing price was roughly the same as the opening price. Recent offers for British exchange were 1 shilling 7 pence 6875, and US dollars at 28 yuan 1875. Banks such as Anda, Sumitomo, and Citibank all offered, and Zhengjin also came to sell off. Sassoon Huabi then advanced. Among the colleagues (gold industry), many were hedging. Although there was a review of 125 (shillings) and 1875 (US dollars) in half a day, the situation was balanced, and the results were all at par with the previous close. The bank's advances and withdrawals for half a day are recorded below:</p>
<p>British Exchange: The opening offer for the near term was 1 shilling 7 pence 75, (or 6875), approximately at par with the previous close. Anda sold April at 875, Sumitomo also offered March at 8125, Sassoon Huabi traded the same month at the same price, Mackellar offered April at 75, Panegen sold to Sassoon July at 8125, Anda sold to Holland March at 75. The afternoon close offered February at 1 shilling 7 pence 6875, March and April the same at 75, May at 8125. The bidding price was an additional 0625.</p>
<p>US Exchange: The opening offer for the near term was 28 yuan 1875, at par with the previous close. Zhejiang Zhongfu both took April at 375, Anda sold to Huabi February at 3125, Sumitomo sold March at 375, Citibank offered and Zhengjin took February at 125, Citibank also sold to Mitsui the same month at the same price, Dongya stuffed Shanghai hedging May at 375, HSBC sold to Sassoon April at 25, Hefeng · Zhongfu traded April at 25, Zhengjin sold to Huabi April at 375, Youli sold to Huabi, Zhongfu also hedged May both at 4375.

<h3 id="e260">Money Industry Market to Resume Afternoon Trading Tomorrow <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>The money industry market trades in premium drafts and loans. There have traditionally been morning and afternoon markets every day. For the past ten or so days, due to the beginning of the abolished lunar new year, all industries have been at a standstill, and the time for operations has not yet arrived. To save on procedures, only the morning market has been open. Once business opportunities develop, afternoon market trading will resume. This is a customary practice of the past. It has been very quiet these past two weeks since January 25th, (that is, the so-called New Year's Day and Lantern Festival). However, in the past few days, due to the abolition of the tael and the conversion to yuan, banks urgently need to implement this and must prepare sufficient amounts of silver dollars to be able to circulate them. But there is no way to buy or sell them. Although the morning market is quite inconvenient, some have proposed to start the afternoon market early. In response to the needs of the times, the Money Industry Market, after deliberation by the Market Committee, approved the resumption of afternoon market trading tomorrow (that is, the 10th, which is also the sixteenth day of the first lunar month) to facilitate the turnover of various industries and to facilitate bank transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e261">Securities and Bond Market Still in the Works <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>| Major Players Absent: Situation Stagnant |</p>
<p>Yesterday, the situation in the Chinese Securities Exchange public bond market became even more wooden. Gatherings were sparse, the market was quiet, and transactions were even fewer. Most groups were watching, and major players were absent. In the four trading sessions throughout the day, the market price hovered between 1 and 2 jiao. Only in the morning close did this month's salt tax rise by 3 jiao due to the purchase of 100,000 by No. 38, a relatively large amount. The quietness of the trading can be seen from this. Because the money industry was slow to submit folds, most major players did not take action. Various inland groups also have not yet made any moves. In addition, the current situation is still brewing, and retail transactions are also rare. Therefore, the number of transactions yesterday decreased sharply. The total for the day was only 2,633,500 yuan, including 13,500 yuan in spot goods and 2,620,000 yuan in futures. The combined salt tax accounted for half of this. As a result, the market price mostly edged up by only 2 or 3 jiao, small series of 5 jiao, while recent series of combined tax and the 1921 loan for relief rose slightly by 5 fen to 1 jiao 5 fen. Salt tax alone rose by 2 jiao to 4 jiao. In this brewing situation, the future of the bond market is still inevitably stagnant.</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reports: Tuesday (7th) New York stock market, the trend turned firm. Speculators suddenly became optimistic about the method by which American Telephone &amp; Telegraph would take its dividends. General Motors has already announced that dividends will be paid as usual, and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph may also pay old dividends, or even if reduced, it will likely be minimal. American Telephone &amp; Telegraph shares first rose, and the rest gradually strengthened. The total number of shares traded throughout the day was 580,000. The Dow Jones index is listed on the left:</p>

<p>The yarn market started strong and then weakened, and the situation is still in the works, so the rise and fall were very small, only within 3.5 qian. As for actual demand, the activity seen on the previous day has now come to a standstill. All parties have no active purchasing power. This is because commerce in various places has declined, finances are exhausted, the market is bleak, and yarn sales have faded, resulting in a gradual increase in inventory. However, general buyers expect future development as spring sales have not yet begun, so the pulling force is still strong. Based on the general trend, there will soon be a change realized.</p>

<p>In the early market for Human Cotton bids, US cotton prices rose, but Indian cotton prices fell. A new broker entered the market to purchase, and the market atmosphere tightened, with prices rising by 1, 2, and 3 qian for each month. In the afternoon, the market situation softened slightly. Rongxing's major long positions sold to close out this month, and prices fell by 1 and 2 qian in the distant months. The total transaction volume for the day was 11,100 bales. It was found that Suilong sold 1,400 bales, Yuanji 900 bales, Yukang 450 bales, Mingde 450 bales, and Gengfeng 550 bales. Chongan purchased 1,050 bales, Changji 1,450 bales, Tongfu 550 bales, and Shenji 850 bales.

<p>The cotton market showed a slight softness, due to unstable Indian cotton and a more intense downward trend. Furthermore, Shenxin Factory purchased another 500 pieces at a price 5 qian lower than the previous day, so people's hearts were slightly fatigued. However, the general mentality was very bullish. However, the factory considered foreign cotton to be cheap and handled domestic cotton cautiously. A certain manufacturer's prepared coarse velvet cotton for this month was sufficient, with deliveries of about 30,000 piculs, all coarse velvet goods.</p>

<p>In the early market for Zheng Cotton bids, US cotton rose slightly, but Indian cotton fell sharply, causing a weak sentiment. However, the gold price was still strong, so there were few sellers, with near months falling by 5 fen and far months rising by 5 fen. In the afternoon, it was heard that the fixed opening price for Indian cotton was relatively low, and the market situation suddenly loosened, with each month falling by 1 and 2 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 26,500 dan. It was found that Yukang sold 2,200 dan, Yuanxingchang 2,000 dan, Tongfu 1,200 dan, Yicheng 1,000 dan, Daji 800 dan, and Yuanda 700 dan.

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday's sources were over 20 merchants, city and township stores were weak, with only 200-300 shi bought. Therefore, the price fell by a corner. Rice from Changbang Su and Tongbang and Qingjiao, etc., also fell by a corner. Nan'gang Houdao and Duyangjian Yinyuan, etc., were available in small quantities, and the price was still able to stand firm. Changbang Bianyuan was seen for the first time this year, and there was fierce competition, with a tight situation. The high-quality goods opened at 10 yuan 8 jiao, and medium-grade goods opened at 10 yuan 5 jiao.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday's sources from various River gangs were 43 and 44 merchants. Bai Geng turnover was normal, and the market was stable at a high level. Medium and secondary qualities were weaker by a corner. Bo Dao and Zao Geng arrivals were not strong, retail sales were not bad, Tianjin package lacked transactions, and the price was stable. Yin Yuan and Du Jian arrivals were few and sold, and the market was stable. Bu Jian lacked arrivals, and Ke Jian had no honor or disgrace. Bai Yuan was also slightly down 2 or 3 jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e271">This Month's Flour Shows Well in the Afternoon <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>Flour transactions are suspended for one day today</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the various months generally showed a stable trend. The quotations for foreign wheat were slightly lower by a few fen, and the market price then tended to fluctuate. By the time the afternoon market opened, it was initially stable, but in this month, after the second session, it showed a slightly positive aspect. Because the Tianjin gang had set 230,000 bags of spot goods, manufacturers made slight advances, and people's hearts seemed to be slightly better. As for the far-term months, because it was rumored that a certain factory in Argentina had also made a contract for three ships of foreign wheat (similar to Canada Wheat No. 3), with the price of the first ship at 3 taels 3 qian 7 fen, and then continued to cheapen by 2 fen, people's hearts turned uninspired. Fufeng and other factories also slightly issued files. Looking at foreign wheat from various sources, dumping continues unabated, and the situation is ultimately difficult to improve. As a result, it was better than the previous day by 5 li, March, April, and May were unchanged, June was slightly better by 7.5 li, and July was slightly better by 5 li. Because the 9th is the Old Lunar Lantern Festival, the exchange is closed for one day.</p>

<p>Yesterday's wheat market saw the various months showing a near-steady and far-flat trend after the opening of the market in the morning. This month, due to short positions advancing, people's hearts were slightly better. However, in the far-term months, there were bulls in foreign wheat gradually pulling out, and the number was quite smooth, so people's hearts were flat. By the time the afternoon market opened, all terms, both near and far, were flat. Because foreign wheat hedging continued unabated, and the hawking of spot foreign wheat was also active without end, the various terms each returned a few points. As a result, February and March were relatively unchanged, April was down by 1 fen, and July was better by 1 fen.</p>

<p>The metal market situation was still peaceful yesterday. Although transactions from customer groups and factories were not very enthusiastic, purchases from the construction group were still fairly satisfactory. The market conditions for various goods, due to overseas telegrams yesterday reporting rumors of a sharp rise, people's hearts were consolidated and unwilling to easily open prices, so it was a good scene, greatly different from the past. Colleagues searching for spot goods from foreign firms felt increasingly frequent. It was heard that several foreign firms, such as Devi and Tianshang, sold quite a lot of spot goods yesterday, with tinplate being the most numerous.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 8,400 boxes of large and small tinplate arrived at the New Taikoo Warehouse, 3,000 of which were from the oil company, and 2,000 boxes were transferred to Hankou, so only 3,000 boxes could be sold in this port.</p>
<p>Also, according to a telegram from London on the 8th, copper rose slightly by 0625, electrical copper fell by 125, tin fell by 0625 to 375, lead fell by 125, the March term fell by 0625, zinc rose by 0625, antimony did not change, pig iron fell by 2.6, to 65.00.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was stable with a continued rise in benchmark prices. The guild's price for 24 raw brown sugar and first white was 15 taels and 7 qian. No one accepted it, and later there were slight transactions at 15 taels and 6 qian and a half. No. 20 medium brown sugar and white was 15 taels and 3 qian, No. 89 Dutch red was 12 taels and 3 qian and a half. On the Hanxing side, Jardine Matheson threw out 200 tons of March No. 24 raw white, with the price at 4 yuan 1 jiao and a half Dutch currency, new rules. Other firms were also willing to continue to throw out, so the market was flat. The Jianbang firm continued to open a batch of Di Qing sugar, with the price at 9 taels and 5 qian. The Jian Bing Shuangshi brand opened at 12 taels and 2 qian per shua. Because Di Qing sugar sales were not smooth, traders watched and did not advance, so there were no transactions. However, according to a letter from Shantou, the previous goods had been exhausted, and subsequent batches were never received, the base was quite firm, and the market situation had a divergent trend. Attached is the New York telegram of the 7th, the spot price was 6 jiao 5 fen 625, unchanged. The futures for March, July, December, and January were up 3 pounds each, and May was up 4 pounds, September was up 2 pounds. Also, according to a London telegram, March was up 2 and a half pence, to 4.275, May was up 2 pence 75, to 5.3, and August was up 2 and a half pence, to 5.575. Java white sugar was still 7.750, (all of the above are calculated at 120 pounds).</p>

<p>| New Mushrooms Still Popular with Customers |</p>
<p>The sea cucumber market in various producing areas is very stable, and the inventory in Shanghai is not thick, but because customer sales are sluggish, the price has gradually declined. Yesterday's listed prices were Jiajiaxi six-branch white bottom boots sea cucumber at 128 taels, eight-branch at 124 taels, twelve-branch at 103 taels, sixteen-branch at 84 taels and 5 qian, four-branch black wrinkled sea cucumber at 210 taels, five-branch at 190 taels, six-branch at 165 taels, two-branch Jinshan Meihua sea cucumber at 162 taels, four-branch at 147 taels, six-branch at 123 taels and 5 qian, two-branch Jinshan Wuyan sea cucumber at 108 taels, four-branch at 95 taels, six-branch Li Huiyan sea cucumber at 56 taels, eight-branch at 52 taels and 5 qian. Compared to the market in the winter of last year, each grade fell by 10 to 20 taels, and the firm's purchase appetite was weak. If customer sales do not improve, there is little hope for a temporary recovery.</p>
<p>New mushrooms from various sources continue to arrive recently. Yesterday, a large area of Tunxi high-quality goods opened at 144 taels, medium-grade at 132 and 3 taels, and low-grade at 118 taels. Fujian goods ranged from 142 taels and 5 qian to 126 taels. Chen Jian mushrooms were 115 taels. Transactions on this street were quite strong, and the goods were sold as soon as they arrived, with few remaining.</p>

<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>As the wheat sprouts emerged from the soil, A-rong's mother abandoned the young couple and went to sleep beneath the earth. A brand-new earthen grave was piled up in the southwest corner of their yard. The hot tears cried by the son and daughter-in-law almost scalded the weeds next to the grave, but the dead person still could not be revived by crying.</p>
<p>They were extremely sad.</p>
<p>[Don't think about it anymore, you can't bring her back by thinking.]</p>
<p>The wife, seeing A-lao unhappy, comforted him. Similarly, A-rong also comforted her:</p>
<p>[You don't need to worry anymore either, anyway, she couldn't have stayed with us for life.]</p>
<p>Such mutual consolations eased their sorrow.</p>
<p>However, both of them had the same question, which was:</p>
<p>Why did Mom die so quickly, in just three days?</p>
<p>Later, both of them had the same answer:</p>
<p>[Why? Because we didn't have extra money!]</p>
<p>Fortunately, a new miracle occurred a month later. This unexpected event increased their infinite joy, and this joy later overcame all the sorrow.</p>
<p>A small creature had already occupied a considerable position in A-rong's wife's belly.</p>
<p>This was such a joyful thing!</p>
<p>·············</p>
<p>After the New Year, the green wheat had grown to more than an inch high. It was a clear and peaceful day, the sun shining high. A-rong, barefoot, was digging up mud in the shallow creek. He carried the mud to the wheat field and spread it around, considering it fertilizer. Everyone was taking advantage of this good day to dig.</p>
<p>His feet, legs, body, and even his face were covered with mud, but A-rong didn't pay attention to any of that. He kept digging, one scoop at a time, and after digging, he carried it to the wheat field. A large pit was gradually dug out in the creek, and a large pile accumulated in the wheat field. The weather was still quite cold, but his whole body was itching, and later he was covered in large drops of sweat. He was panting heavily.</p>
<p>After a while, he leaned against the bank of the creek and lay down, his eyes looking at the sky.</p>
<p>There were floating clouds, birds, and the sun in the sky, and he saw them all. Then he lowered his head and looked around at the fields, at the people working in the fields, at the passersby, and at his mother's grave. He stayed there for a while.</p>
<p>When he stood up and was about to go down into the creek to dig mud again, he suddenly saw his wife spreading mud in the wheat field, and she had already spread a large area, covering the green seedlings with a layer of black stuff. He looked, thought, and realized something was wrong. He hurriedly walked to where his wife was working and asked:</p>
<p>[How long have you been doing this? Go back quickly.]</p>
<p>His wife didn't answer, but looked at him, at the mud all over his body, and smiled.</p>
<p>[Don't tire yourself out, don't you know?] he said again.</p>
<p>The eyes of both of them involuntarily focused on one place, the place that contained a small life.</p>
<p>[Go back, I'll definitely finish it by tonight,] he said, becoming insistent. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e302">Welcome, Antiquities <a href="#e302" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c302" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">302</a></h3>
<p>— Xuan</p>
<p>Ever since the cannons of Japanese imperialism captured [The First Majestic Pass Under Heaven] in four hours, the great officials and gentlemen have been worried about the antiquities in the cultural city of Beiping. Now it's all right. Pingjin has not yet fallen, but the antiquities have already been packed into boxes waiting to be transported; it is said that there are three thousand large wooden boxes in total, requiring four trains to move them; in that case, should Pingjin fall in the not-too-distant future, but the antiquities remain unharmed, the great officials and gentlemen can at least plead innocence before their ancestors.</p>
<p>Although there are as many as three thousand boxes of antiquities, in the end, there are only three thousand boxes, and four trains can carry them all away. This cannot be compared to the land of Pingjin, which cannot be transported away. As for the common people of Pingjin, the hundreds of thousands of common people, it is even less necessary to plan for them; they have their own legs!</p>
<p>Moreover, in terms of value, the common people are hateful, while the antiquities are precious. Haven't you seen the many books written by foreign dignitaries about the ancient Chinese kingdom? They mock the pig-like Chinese common people, but praise the unparalleled Chinese antiquities! If valuable antiquities were lost for the sake of worthless common people, wouldn't that be a lament for the foreign dignitaries, and wouldn't it cause international ridicule? Therefore, we common people cannot but thank the great officials and gentlemen for their painstaking efforts in serving the country!</p>
<p>However, the Japanese imperialists with ulterior motives do not seem to let go just because the antiquities of Beiping have been moved away. They are hurriedly increasing their troops to the border of Rehe. We use trains to transport antiquities, and they use trains to transport troops. The common people of Pingjin see the antiquity trains heading south, but do not see the troop trains heading north, and they hear that the Japanese army is pressing in step by step. Their abandoned and helpless tears can only be swallowed into their stomachs. Unfortunately, the mechanical civilization of the foreign devils has not yet reached omnipotence. Otherwise, using a huge crane to lift all the national treasures of the ancient Chinese kingdom, such as the Three Seas and the Imperial Palace in Beiping, the Confucius Forest in Qufu, and the Sun Mausoleum in Nanjing, all together to the highest peak of the Himalayas, so that the great officials and gentlemen could safely guard there [for long-term resistance], wouldn't that be an unparalleled feat!</p>
<p>However, the fact that there are already four trains of antiquities waiting to be transported is indeed an amazing scheme. After the common people are moved to tears of gratitude, they should shout three times... Long live the antiquities!</p>
<h3 id="e303">The New System of Weights and Measures <a href="#e303" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c303" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">303</a></h3>
<p>— Peng Jiahhuang</p>
<p>We Chinese people have our own national essence. For example, the calendar follows the old method, and the waxing and waning of the moon can be used to deduce the new moon and full moon. In that case, there is nothing wrong with the [lunar calendar]. If it must be changed to the [solar calendar], it would be better to change it completely. However, after so many years, it is still unclear which is [lunar] and which is [solar]. Government offices, companies, and banks follow their [solar calendar], while landladies, nannies, and the like follow their [lunar calendar]. Recently, with the exception of foreigners, whether they are new or old figures, they all have some [lunar] air, and [lunar] calendars are also very popular. Almost even many modern female students have memorized the [first day] and [fifteenth day] of the lunar month, and can accurately match them to the corresponding dates in the [solar calendar] without any mistakes. But like in the past few years, when the [lunar calendar] was banned and lunar calendars could not be bought, there was no way to deduce the new moon and full moon. If you ask a woman, [Is today the...?], she can very precisely calculate that in ten or twenty days it will be [Dragon Boat Festival] or [Double Ninth Festival], and she should prepare zongzi and festival gifts. Why do they want to preserve this national essence? In fact, speaking plainly, it's worth a few dollars. Because some months in the [solar calendar] have thirty-one days, while the [lunar calendar] has at most thirty days per month. Collecting rent and receiving wages are still more cost-effective with the [lunar calendar]. If there were no [solar calendar], there would be no way to cheat.</p>
<p>Speaking of weights and measures, there was originally a [system], but the previous [system] was too old and had flaws, so there should be a [new] one. For example, a vegetable vendor says that his is the official [system], sixteen taels. Maybe it is sixteen taels, but we always think that his is fourteen taels, twelve taels. No, only my twenty taels, twenty-four taels, is right. But no one is willing to exchange.</p>
<p>The [new] [system] is of course better than the [old] one. But according to the report from the Municipal Weights and Measures Inspection Office to the Social Bureau: [ ...changing to the new system ...taking the opportunity to raise prices ...and fabricating official instrument titles, deceiving and peddling ...will cause this city's handling of weights and measures administration, which is inherently beneficial to the people, to be tarnished with the name of profit-seeking, affecting its credibility... ] What should we do if this continues?</p>
<p>The [new] [system] has just started, and it is already [old] again. I think it would be best to have an even newer [system], a perpetually flaw-free, updated [system]. Otherwise, we might as well close the [new] foreign schools and encourage people to read more of the [old] sages' books: [Cultivate your heart, refine your character, regulate your family, and then you can govern the country and bring peace to the world.]</p>

<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>[Why isn't there any news yet?]</p>
<p>He became anxious. He looked at his watch again, and only seven more minutes had passed since he looked at it last time. He sighed softly again.</p>
<p>[It's better not to pay attention to such a boring woman! She's not worth me being so upset for! I want to remain chaste for Peizhu!]</p>
<p>He tried his best to suppress his desires again, closing his eyes. He thought that being able to fall asleep like this would be fortunate. Everything would be settled tomorrow.</p>
<p>He drifted in and out of consciousness for a while, then seemed to be startled awake by something unexpected. He looked at his watch again, it was almost half past one.</p>
<p>[This is truly unreasonable! She dares not come up to see me! I'll have to question her properly tomorrow! If I don't get a satisfactory answer, I'll give her an ultimatum. The final measure is to move out of this house!]</p>
<p>The more he thought about it, the angrier he became. He was mentally drafting how to word his questions to her tomorrow.</p>
<p>[She is a very cunning woman. Even if I question her tomorrow, there will be no results. She will definitely say the same thing as last time, that she saw I was asleep and didn't dare to disturb me... This is just infuriating!]</p>
<p>He turned over and sat up, put the long cotton robe hanging on the back of the chair on his back, put on his slippers, and decided to go downstairs to inquire about her movements.</p>
<p>[Wouldn't it be embarrassing if she saw me?... It doesn't matter! I have a legitimate reason to come down, if I see her, I'll just go to the bathroom to relieve myself!]</p>
<p>At the top of the stairs, he looked down to the second floor, but it was all dark.</p>
<p>[Are they all asleep? That's good, let me go down and see what she and that Japanese guy are doing... ]</p>
<p>Using the light from his room, he felt along the edge of the stairs and walked down to the second floor. He stood at the door of Mrs. Tsuruko's room, pressing down on his racing heart, and listened for a moment to the movements inside, but he couldn't hear any sound. He concentrated and listened carefully again, and there seemed to be a slight snoring sound inside, but he couldn't tell if it was from one person or two.</p>
<h3 id="e305">How to Avoid Tragedy After Marriage? <a href="#e305" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c305" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">305</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Fengcheng</p>
<p>Love is like drinking wine, the taste is sweet and rich, the color is bright red: in the process of love, one can sometimes forget everything.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of love is marriage, and marriage is the final destination of love. Young men and women in the midst of passionate love are constantly pursuing the goal of marriage. But the question arises, are love and marriage really two separate stages? Some say: marriage is the graveyard of love; others say: marriage is the home of love. Is the life of love happier, or is the life after marriage happier? This question has been discussed by many people, but no conclusion has been reached so far, because each person's views are different, and each person's life is also different. Some people are happier after marriage than when they were in love, while others are very good when they are in love, but everything is shattered after marriage.</p>
<p>Of course, the luckiest people are those who are happier after marriage than when they were in love; the question that I want to raise here is that I have seen many people who are often very passionate and happy when they are in love, but as soon as they get married, a tragedy occurs.</p>
<p>How to avoid tragedy after marriage is of course a question worth discussing.</p>
<p>Now, based on my personal observations and the experiences I have gained from several friends, the tragedies that occur after they get married are nothing more than the following:</p>
<p>First, in love, everything is centered on love, and both sides only have emotion and no reason. Each person's personality and temperament are shrouded in passion. Even if he has a bad temper, he will never flare up in front of his lover. He will definitely be as gentle as a little lamb and as happy as a little angel. In that height of overflowing passion, each person's bad temper and bad habits are hidden. Therefore, in passionate love, it is difficult to discover the differences in each person's personality when everything starts with emotion. However, it is different after marriage, because married life is relatively calm and stable. Each person's personality and temperament also erupt as the marriage period lengthens. What could be sacrificed in love often cannot be sacrificed after marriage. The temper that could not be seen in love completely erupts after marriage. From then on, a tragedy occurs between the two, often leading to divorce due to differences in personality and character after marriage. This is the most common tragedy that occurs after marriage.</p>
<p>Second, the difference in each person's living habits. This is also often difficult to discover for a while during the love period, and is not noticed by both parties. Because the two sides have not lived together during the love period, then the differences in the living habits of the two sides are often not easily discovered. Moreover, during the love period, even if there are any differences in the living habits of each person, both sides are willing to compromise and sacrifice for each other. For example, the man's life is active, and the woman's life is quiet. During the love period, if the man often asks the woman to go out and play, even if the woman sometimes feels unwilling, but in order to make their love without any regrets, she often sacrifices her own habits and agrees to the man's request. This kind of sacrifice is often unwilling after marriage. For example, if the woman already has a child, she needs a calmer and more stable life. If the man continues to ask her constantly, she will unceremoniously reject him. At that time, the man will feel disappointed and disillusioned, thinking that his lover is not as lively and lovely as before. If this continues, it will also destroy the future of their love. This is the second type of tragedy that may occur after marriage.</p>

<h3 id="e306">On Smoking <a href="#e306" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c306" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">306</a></h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Since I am a smoker myself, I have many strange understandings about smoking.</p>
<p>After eating, you must smoke, when using the toilet, you must smoke, you can smoke while reading, and you need to smoke even more when writing articles. When talking with friends, you must smoke, but when talking with your lover, you can't smoke; the reason is very simple, because many women will mostly be saddened to tears by the smoke.</p>
<p>Many people think that smoking is just a kind of life philosophy, and it only needs to be embellished in front of people, so there is no need to be serious. However, there are also many people who regard smoking as an essential element of life, and they cannot be without it for a moment. Therefore, when he gets on the tram, he clearly sees the words "No Smoking" written on the tram, but he insists on smoking, and spews it at people's faces. From this, it can be known that this kind of person's addiction to smoking is also very strong.</p>
<p>There are all kinds of cigarettes, perhaps because they are different for different people. For example, gentlemen must have cigars, artists must have tobacco pipes, old men mostly like [Gold and Silver], young men love to smoke [Aiqing], old masters should smoke [Gao Er Fu], young masters should smoke [Meili], (English name is My Dear), rich people should smoke [Chesterfield] brand, and poor people can only eat [Kotou] brand made of cigarette butts. As for the current critical and dangerous autumn when the national crisis is deepening and foreign insults are becoming more and more urgent, we patriotic people should not only sincerely obey orders to promote domestic goods and not smoke [Shenxian] (said to be inferior goods), but also unite and cooperate to smoke [Hero Brand], moreover, [smoking to save the country] may not be a way to save the country.</p>
<p>Writing freely, many words are not carefully chosen. Finally, I respectfully recite [Amitabha!]</p>

<p>Spring day, troops drill horses in the camp, late at night, wave swords on the snowy ground, the general's great ambition embraces mountains and rivers, truly worthy of the name of a hero.</p>
<p>Northeast, the atmosphere of banditry is pervasive, Jinling, the royal aura diminishes, ten thousand families still sing songs of peace, heaven does not care about the fall of a famous city.</p>

<h3 id="e309">The Prime Mover of the Future <a href="#e309" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c309" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">309</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Heng</p>
<p>This is a problem that humanity depends on for survival and that must be solved: Where will we get our prime mover in the future? What if electricity and trams stop working, all the chimneys no longer belch black smoke, and engines and motors all fall into slumber, if coal and petroleum are all used up?</p>
<p>This day is finally coming. Some people have already estimated that the coal on Earth is only enough to maintain us for one or two thousand years. If the use of coal expands even more, it might not even last a thousand years! The situation with oil is the same.</p>
<p>This is not only a problem for the future, but it is becoming a problem for the present. Some countries rely entirely on foreign imports for coal and oil. Japan is one such example. Deeds of aggression often arise from this problem.</p>
<p>If the end of the prime mover really comes, where will violent force go to seize coal and oil? Moreover, the sharp weapons of force - warships, tanks, and airplanes - cannot function without the prime mover.</p>
<p>The first new prime mover is water power. In the United States, it can be said that it has been fully utilized. According to the report of the engineers of the Construction Committee, the Yangtze River in our country can generate four million horsepower from Chongqing to Yichang. When the hydropower plant is established in the future, its effectiveness will certainly be great, and the amount of coal saved will be considerable.</p>
<p>Second, is the use of the power of the tides. Anyone who has been to Qiantang to see the tide will think about the greatness of the power of the tides! The United States is now planning how to use tidal power in the Bay of Fundy.</p>
<p>The third is the sun. Have you ever thought about how much heat the sun emits? In every square mile of the tropics, the heat it gives off is equivalent to 10,000 tons of coal! As for how to collect this heat source, there is still no perfect method.</p>
<p>Finally, there is synthetic fuel, most of which is made by combining carbon monoxide and hydrogen under pressure and temperature. Carbon monoxide is a by-product of several major industries, but hydrogen is a gas, and the necessary pressure and temperature all rely on the existence of other prime movers, so it is not considered a complete success. However, the characteristics and effectiveness of this fuel are great, usually twice as strong as gasoline.</p>
<p>We cannot help but ask a question: Will these new prime movers have a day when they run out? In short, the existence of water power and tides is completely related to the power of the sun. If the sun is not destroyed, water power and tides will not rest. If the sun is destroyed, even if we have the prime mover, what can we do?</p>

<p>— Exploring from Women's Names —</p>
<p>Women are lovely, exploring from good names, what Yang Wanyu, Xi Yueqin, Ping Huiyu, Pan Baozhu, Li Suzhen, Jin Xiufen, Wang Renmei, Dai Xiaolong, Huang Jinhua, Jin Lijiao... You see [Jade]! [Qin]! [Pearl]! [Zhen]! [Fen]! [Mei]! [Li]! [Jiao]! How touching and endearing!</p>
<p>Exploring from women's names, women, women! Lovely, lovely!</p>
<p>Ladies are more lovable than men! Therefore, there is the derogatory term [stinky man], but women have the name [charming beauties]. Even generals do not love empires, they love beauties - women! Because women are lovely!</p>
<p>American youths - men - have two major idols, namely gold and beauty. If you want to get a lover, first ask if you have gold? If you want gold, first ask if you have learning? With learning, it's not difficult to earn money.</p>
<p>The culture of the world, in fact, is all for the lovely white woman behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Having money, being a what-ever-leader, beautiful young women, it's not a problem, you can find a way to get them, a poor scholar can't even get a pockmarked yellow-faced woman easily!</p>
<p>Of course! Women are lovely! It's not difficult to have money! It's not difficult to ask for a beauty, just give money.</p>
<p>Then, women are lovely! Gold is even more lovely.</p>
<p>Foreign youths love gold and love beauties. Chinese youths also love gold and love beauties. However, foreign youths pursue gold and beauties by relying on their own knowledge and talent, using legitimate means. Chinese youths pursue gold and beauties, wanting to make a fortune, corruption, opportunistic, the attitude is not honorable. This is the difference.</p>
<p>In short, although women are lovely, prepare gold first, otherwise you don't know the ways of the world, but listening to the names of women can also quench thirst with plums.</p>
