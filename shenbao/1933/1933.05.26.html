<p>時評</p>
<h3>羅斯福與石井菊次郎　明</h3>
<p>美國自遭受此次金融恐慌而後。即審知美國一國之繁榮决不可靠雖汎美經濟聯盟在地理上兩洋相隔。獨得天然勝境。在人事上門羅主義相習迄今南北美諸國。莫不聽美國之領導。宜乎可以維持萬世之繁榮。長保其金融王之寳座矣。然而除南北美以外。加拿大對英帝國。雖有離心傾向但究爲一體。歐洲另成系統一受法蘭西之領導再則爲法西斯主義德意兩國之聯結。東方之日本復高倡其所謂「日滿經濟聯盟。」欲進而鎖閉遠東門。户蘇聯地跨歐亞自成經濟體系與。整個資本主義相頡頏。於是北美合衆國遂腹背受敵幾陷於不能自拔之苦境。英首相麥唐納與美總統羅斯福談話之初隠隠中美已抛棄其傳統習慣進而企圖國際合作。華盛頓爐邊會談。原爲六月十二日倫敦世界經濟會議之預備會捨有關於經濟意見之交換外。似别無所圖。假使世界經濟真能求得一確切適當之解决方法。則政治上之糾紛。不難迎刃而解經濟上好市面之到來殆在指顧間耳。</p>
<p>及至本月中旬歐洲之政治危機忽愈顯露軍備縮小運動瀕於半身不遂狀態法德衝突幾引起歐洲各國之政治爭執。軍備竸賽疆域再劃殖民地重行分割等問題。在在足以爆發戰爭。掀動禍亂。而遠東方面一年八個月以來。每日在戰爭恐怖中度過。今日軍且進至我津東一帶。軍國主義者之鐵蹄任意蹂躪是種情况。在我固蒙受莫大損失。而世經濟亦遭絶大打撃。市塲縮小。消費力減退經濟恐慌仍不知將伊於胡底是以美總統於本月十六日。發出和平宣言提議實行軍備縮小。在歐洲誠爲一針見血適應目前之需要。在遠東亦何嘗不合於禍迫眉睫急待迴蘇之時機耶。</p>
<p>就日美兩國間表面形勢而論。在經濟方面。美國爲重工業。國日本爲輕工業國旣無貿易上之經對衝突。投資海外各有範圍戰債賠欵。又兩不相干。則美日之間適相補足。經濟提携尤多條件。此「石井藍辛協定」所以成立之起因也。然而太平洋之爭覇戰中日美雙方又皆爲主角者何耶。蓋日本獨占東亞。匪特破壞國際均衡且斷絶美國開拓海外市塲之生機復可伸其魔手於南美國時囊括「滿洲。」侵襲華北。美國固受莫大之影響然而重洋遠隔勢不能及。日軍之暴横又非空言所能制止此其所以躊躇而莫可如何也。</p>
<p>不過在經濟上日本處於金圓金磅兩大之間英美通貨。如趨安定則日圓勢不能不求新平價於是日貨輸出乃處於不利地位。否則英美協加以報復日本亦甚困難。軍縮問題。如美法諒解成立勢必强制日本參加日本如悍然拒絶將不免受國際之壓迫。設使參加則對華北對東三省將受國際條約之拘束軍國主義。必成内外之不安。多他種勢力牽制至於市塲問題在世界經濟會議中。亦占特殊重要地位。日本如果參與國際市塲協定第一即難於獨占「滿洲」第二後起之日本産業。其進路將爲先進諸國龐大經濟勢力所鎖閉假令閉關自守　頇到底則又不免「抵貨」之威脅。感孤立之危險　　羅斯福總統與石井代表談話。縱未正式開始但觀石井氏之公開聲明。與日本年餘以來之對外政策即可推知其重重矛盾。不過表面上以和平敷衍美國至於經濟恐慌之解除。恐終以軍事的威脅。而無從求得善果也。</p>

<h3>本市新聞</h3>
<p>吳市長發表對時局重要談话</p>
<p>談判局部停戰絶非屈服妥協</p>
<p>承認僞國全係敵人内奸造謡</p>
<p>國人仍應臥薪嘗膽長期抵抗</p>
<p>擾亂地方反抗中央者當嚴懲</p>
<p>中央社云、近自北方停戰消息傳播以來、平津附近戰事依然激烈、談判雖在進行、和平未易實現、各方懸揣、莫知真相、本埠更謡諑繁興、空氣頓形緊張、記者昨特叩訪吳市長、當承發表關於時局之詳盡談話、（以下均吳市長語）</p>
<h3>國難嚴重</h3>
<p>至此、正宜全國上下、一德一心、安内攘外、中央自九一八以還、始終抱定一面抵抗、一面交涉之决心、絶無屈服暴力簽訂辱國條約之意念、迨熱榆告急、中央更調撥師旅、北上抗日、長城一帶、壯烈犧牲、共聞共見、而同時贛省赤匪、騷擾累年、合力圍剿、又不容絲毫鬆懈、中央兼籌並顧、煞費苦心、較之徒唱高調、難易不可以道里計、此次黄膺白奉命北上、組政務整理委員會、適值前方軍事稍有失利、</p>
<h3>事勢所趨</h3>
<p>乃有使團斡旋進行停戰談判之舉、黄氏丁此艱危、秉承中央、折衝其間、但期平津得以保全、難民稍蘇喘息、而中日間之根本爭點、即東三省與熱河問題、仍必訴諸國際之公約、吾國人長期抵抗之責任、依然不容稍懈、所敢斷言者、中央决願作城下之盟、自毁民族之立塲、以承認所謂「滿洲國」也、須知我國旣爲國聯會員國、復曾簽字於九國公約·及非戰公約·中央及屢屢聲明、接受國聯之决議、豈肯在國際聞不承認「滿洲國」原則之下、反由我國先予以承認、而自外於國聯、此雖婦孺、皆知其必無是理、顯係日方故意造謡、内奸從而鼓煽、凡真心愛國家愛民族者、自必不致堕其奸計、自相搗亂、兹有兩事、願藉報紙公告於吾全上海之市民、（一）中央</p>
<h3>盱衡全局估量情勢、接受停</h3>
<p>戰之談判、其爲忍痛不待煩言、故即使局部停戰實現國人亦應痛定思痛、繼續爲長期之奮鬥、須知停戰原不過某一時期某一地帶之停止軍事動作、旣非屈服、更非放棄抵抗、吾上海市民、仍應臥薪嘗膽努力雪恥、不容有絲毫苟安心理、馴致眼光如豆、祗知爭逐蠅頭微利、放棄長期抵抗之决心、否則慢性亡國之毒、將至不可救藥、（二）我國之無組織、不團結、素爲日人所譏剌、姑無論北方</p>
<h3>局部停戰之是否成爲事實、</h3>
<p>即使在不牽涉政治條件之下、爲事實上之停戰、吾國人亦正宜深諒中央之苦心、絶不應强指停戰爲屈服妥協、以爲攻撃中央之口實、或甚至引伸日人之謡傳、强誣中央接受屈辱之條件、而列舉未來之「大患」以詆責中央、譬如西南方面、向僅空言抗日、而絶未出師北上增援、高談剿赤、而絶未派兵兜剿、反而挑撥抗日將士之情感、沮喪剿赤將士之勇氣、最近復摭拾謡言、含沙射影、誣蔑中央將承認「滿洲國、」甚至通電國聯、及簽字九國公約各國</p>
<h3>自暴分裂爲親者痛、爲仇者</h3>
<p>快、因此國家主義派份子、在北方及長江下游、亦復紛紛活動、在平津則勾結失意軍閥政客、如張敬堯·孫傳芳·齊爕元·吳景濓·輩、有所密謀、企圖於敵人蔭庇之下、另造北方之新政權、在上海則聯合反動各派、妄想鼓動罷課罷工罷市、擾亂地方秩序、造成恐怖局面、以爲奪取政權之張本、暗中更不惜聯絡共産黨徒、準備暴動、馴致鼓吹中央不必勦赤、不應勦赤、或謬稱赤匪可以交出紅軍、前往抗日、以圖淆惑世聽、增長匪燄、諸如此類、誠屬</p>
<h3>喪心病狂無可理喻、吾上海</h3>
<p>市民、須知上海爲全國金融命脈所繋、抗日勦赤之成敗利鈍、莫不與上海地方之治亂息息相關、一二八抗戰以後、吾上海市民正宜痛定思痛、埋頭苦幹、培養國家之元氣、增厚國家之實力、從事實際上抗日救國之工作、對於若輩專唱高調、有意搗亂之内奸、不但應不爲所惑、且當羣策羣力、痛予掃除、庶幾内可安而外可攘、國家之奇恥大辱、終有湔滌之一日、</p>
<p>總之、余旣身列中委、又爲本市地方長官、其唯一職責、即在秉承中央安内攘外不屈不撓之宗旨、盡力以安定地方之秩序、團結市民之意志、培養國家之富力、在此内外交迫、百孔千瘡之際、苟有不顧民族國家之利益、居心煽惑、到處播謡、希圖擾亂地方、反抗中央者、職責所在、自必嚴厲懲處、以遏亂萌、凡吾市民、幸各努力、共維治安、地方幸甚、國家幸甚、</p>
<h3>工廠檢查問題</h3>
<p>俞鴻鈞費信惇今日下午會商</p>
<p>關於檢查租界工廠問題、吳市長日前晋京、曾與外交實業兩部商决、由市府負責與公共租界當局會商合作辦法、兹悉市政府秘書長俞鴻鈞氏、定於今日下午二時、往訪公共租界總裁費信惇氏、開始商議、合作辦法、兹誌其各情如次、</p>
<h3>今日會商原則</h3>
<p>中央社記者、昨訪費信惇於工部局、詢以關於租界</p>
<p>工廠檢查問題、據談、市府秘書長俞鴻鈞氏、已定於明</p>
<p>日（即今日）下午、來訪　　本人、討論關於租界方面、與市區有關係各種問題、租界工廠檢查問題、决定提出討論、惟預料該問題、非短期内所能解决、明日與俞氏所討論者、不過一種原則、俟原則决定後、方可以續商詳細解决辦法云、</p>
<h3>使團復文未到</h3>
<p>又據工部局情報處主任西人勃登賽ＢurtonＳayer語中央社記者、關於市府與工部局、會談租界工廠檢查問題、俞費兩氏、曾時</p>
<p>作非正式之晤談、但無甚進展、蓋租界工廠檢查問题、自領事團將修改洋涇浜章程附律呈請公使團後、迄未奉到復諭、預料兩星期後、復諭奉到、方可依照進行云</p>
<h3>費氏折衷辦法</h3>
<p>新聲社云、自工部局與市政府雙方疊次磋商後、至前日、工部局總董費信惇、</p>
<p>曾以私人建議資格、向我方提出意見、其大意謂、彼建議主張租界工廠檢查辦法、可仿租界印花税徴收處分辦法、及租界捲烟統税徴收處分法、成立一檢查處、爲委員性質、華租當局各派員執行、此項辦法、可</p>
<p>視爲工部局非正式而表示接受檢查之折衷意見、我方代表俞鴻钧、對此意見、除約以考慮後答復外、已電實業部徴求意見、</p>
<h3>實部復電大意</h3>
<p>據實業部方面所聞、曾於接俞氏報告後、即去一復電、聞大致表示、對此種折</p>
<p>衷辦法、尙屬可行、惟認爲檢查處之組織、應以華方官廳人員爲主體、人員亦應華方得有較多參加之規定、而尤爲注重者、即檢查之執行、將來如有發見不妥之處、其處分權應屬於上海特區法院、至印花税捲烟統、税之各項手續、是否與檢查工廠間多可、以同一辦法處理、則正在研究、大致以目下磋商情形、前途頗有互相諒解、不曰解决形勢、至於詳細實施檢查辦法、俟此項</p>
<h3>銀幣新模型昨已到滬</h3>
<p>中央造幣廠下週啓用新幣六月初流通市面</p>
<h3>審查委員會定今日成立</h3>
<p>中央造幣廠銀幣新模型、業於昨日到滬、審查委員會定於今日正式成立、以便新</p>
<p>幣查之後、早日流通於市面、兹將詳情探誌如下、</p>
<h3>新幣模型昨晨到滬</h3>
<p>中央造幣廠、原有銀幣模型、正面爲總理遺像、反面爲一帆船</p>
<p>、尙有飛鳥三隻、翶翔於帆船之上、旁有旭日東昇之影、嗣財部以旭日東昇之影、易爲一般人所誤解、乃决將其取消、另向美國定鑄新模型、兹悉此項新模型、業於昨晨到滬、中央造幣廠方面、刻正加以洗刷、决自下星期一起開始、應用此項新模型鑄造新幣、</p>
<h3>審查委會今日成立</h3>
<p>財政部前聘請孔祥煕·徐堪·盧學漙·陳行·席德懋·胡孟嘉·葉琢</p>
<p>堂·張公權·貝淞蓀·唐壽氏·胡筆江、陳蔗青·李馥蓀·錢新之·徐寄廎·徐新六·陳光甫·謝韜甫·秦潤卿·吳藴齋·葉扶霄·胡筠莊·簡東浦·郝樞民·雷生勃·馬肅·林樞·馬錫爾·台維·頼愛司·米納·史比門·耿愛德·麥凱·施璜·史德門·戴景福·等三十七人爲中央造幣廠新幣審查委員會委員、並指定孔祥煕爲委員長、審查新幣之成色重量及差度、該會已定於今日下午四時、在中央造幣廠召開成立大會、以便新幣經審查之後、早日流通於市面、</p>
<h3>六月初旬流通市面</h3>
<p>中央造幣廠以前所出之新幣、均已送往中央銀行、作爲準備金</p>
<p>之用、據該廠副廠長韋敬周氏語中央社記者、新模型定於下星期一開始應用、此後所出新幣、經審委員會審查之後、即可流通於市面、預計六月初旬、新幣當可流通於市面矣、云云該廠過去每日出幣數量之最高紀録爲二十萬元、自新模型應用之後、將盡量生産、可望突破二十萬元之新紀録云、</p>
<p>原則决定後、再行磋商、并聞工部局不日</p>
<p>將有一節略類似備忘録性質者、向我方提出、内容將包括實業部國際勞工局及工部局前此商定之工廠檢查辦法六項原則、及工部局本身意見、以爲表示工部局對此問題之具體意見、</p>
<h3>本市財政難求平衡</h3>
<p>本年度因戰後影響將虧欠至二百萬元</p>
<p>本市財政向稱充裕、自一二八事發生後、致收入鋭減、支出增加、難求平衡、中央社記者、昨特往訪市財政局第三、科科長沈同兹、承見告其情形如下、</p>
<h3>彌補尙無辦法據沈氏云、本市</h3>
<p>自一二八案發生後、財政方面、太受打撃、如房捐田賦等税收、均見鋭減、而支出方面、因環境之需要、不得不予以增加、預計本年度本市財政、將虧欠二百萬元之譜、但一切不急之務、均已從緩舉辦、費用亦已極力撙節、至於該項虧欠鉅欵、究將如何彌補、一時實難奉告、</p>
<h3>地税開徴無期沈氏復云、本局</h3>
<p>原擬於本年内、開始辦理各項新税之徴收、如地價税營業税等以資挹注、但營業税一項、終以租界之故、殊無起色、前雖請託市商會代辦、亦未見有若何效果、至於地價税一項、現雖積極辦理、祗以本市前擬徴收辦法、與中央規定微有出入、當經修正、再呈中央核示、迄今未奉批復、故是項税收究能於何時開徴、現尙未能預知云、</p>
<h3>兩路減氏運價</h3>
<p>減收百分之五十定六月一日實行</p>
<p>京滬滬杭甬兩路運輸、不滿整車貨物、京滬線向照整車貨物運價、加收百分之一百、滬杭甬線、向照整車貨物運價、加收百分之七十五、現聞兩路管理局、爲體恤商艱及流通各處出産零擔貨品起見、業經呈奉鐵道部核准、將兩路不滿整車貨物運價一律改爲按整車貨物運價、加收百分之五十、並定於六月一日起實行云、</p>
<h3>本埠失業西僑</h3>
<p>連白俄在内共約千餘人</p>
<p>大美晚報云、據救世軍職業介紹處及上海青年會職業介紹處消息、本埠失業西僑、已在七百人以上八而白俄尙不在内、其中男子約四百五十人、女子二百七十人、其失業原因、大半由於遠東商業凋疲所致、但亦不乏因在歐美聞上海繁華消息、企圖來覓一枝棲者、查此輩失業者之技能、以寫字間職務居多、但亦有擅長建築·會計·藥劑·工程師等專職者、别其國籍、不下四十餘、内以英美德人居大半、至於白俄失業人數、則據俄移民委員會會長言、男子約在三四百之間、婦女約一百餘人云、</p>
<h3>開灤局否認停業</h3>
<p>大陸報云、本埠開灤礦務局人員、否認該礦因日軍侵略華北、有被迫停閉之虞、並謂目下在滬存貨、尙足敷一月之需、本埠小煤商、仍照舊購販灤礦云、</p>
<h3>銀行界組織農村調劑委員會</h3>
<p>推定張公權等爲委員</p>
<p>上海銀行業同業公會、根據農村復興委員會之函商、擬請组織調劑農村經濟委員會等情、特於昨日下午四時、召集第三上次執行委員會、到者張公權·李銘·徐寄廎·林康侯·吳達銓·宋子良·吳藴齋·等二十餘人、由主席委員李馥蓀主席、秘書顧誠安紀録、報告事項完畢後、依照開會順序、十一條逐條討論、惟均未發表、而對於農村復興會函商一節、則議决組織「農村調劑委員會一、規定委員二十一人、除參加農村復興委員會之十委員張公權·李馥蓀·吳達銓·周作民·錢新之·陳光甫·徐新六·胡筆江·唐壽民·王志莘等爲委員外、並加推徐寄廎·葉扶霄·吳藴齋·朱子良·齊雲青·許伯明·王伯元·胡錫安·孫景西·劉晦之·等十一人、同爲農村調劑委員會委員、並推定李馥蓀爲召集人、至第一次會議日期、由召集人酌定、議畢六時散會、</p>

<p>立關税互惠協定者、俱有互抑税率之優厚待遇、詎　　近今英美各國、覺察日貨有藉關税互惠而傾銷之事、致英美貨物、大受影響、故亦已着手研究辦法、將訂立方案、徴收傾銷税、一方面仍維持互惠協定、以取税率均衡、避免受傾销之虧累、日人聞訊後、亦已與我國問題、同加注意云、</p>
<h3>日商討論我國新關税</h3>
<p>本埠日本各路商聯會以我國新訂之國定關税税則、業於本月二十二日開始施行、對於進口日貨、如棉布及魚介等類、其進口税、較之過去有多徴至二三倍以上者、影響對華貿易、殊匪淺鮮、因特於昨日下午六時、在文監師路日商俱樂部、召開全滬日商代表大會、討論應付辦法、到三十餘人、日各路商聯會、並擬下列各案、交衆討論、（一）積極在滬籌設日貨製造廠、（二）電請外務省、向中國政府提出交涉、要求修改業已施行之國定關税税則、（三）如何提高日貨價格、以免受過鉅之損失等三項、至於其他日商提案、約共計十餘件、討論至八時許、尙未散會、</p>

<h3>王延松昨在中西播音台演講</h3>
<p>國難期中應如何穏定金融</p>
<p>上海市商會常務委員綢業銀行經理王延松氏、年來除從事公共事業外、尤鋭意於銀行事業之經營、近鑒於國難日急、商業凋敝、益感覺金融界責任之重大、並謂、救濟國難、應各從本位做起、特於昨晚、應中西播音台之敦請、講演國難期中應如何穏定金融、以告世人、其演詞如次、一年以來、中國已到了一個極嚴重的時期、言國難則日軍長驅南下、平津危急、言社會則内地匪共未清、農村經濟破産、言經濟則資金偏枯、實業奄奄待斃、在這種千瘡百孔的狀態之下、一旦發生特殊事故、立刻就可以掀起绝大波瀾、而發生全國的磊紊亂、金融界爲一國經濟的樞紐、其感受影響的感應最快、其影響及人也最深、因此在這種危機四伏、一觸即發的局勢之下、金融界應如何時時的準備着應付這險惡的環境、以安定全國的金融、吾們以爲有五點、是金融界所應當特殊注意的、第一充實準備、所謂銀行的業務、不外一方面吸收社會的剩餘資金、一方面又供給社會資金的需要、不過銀行受人信用、大部份負有要求卽付的義務、而與人信用、則須到期收回、因此銀行乃不得不保持相當數額的準備金、以爲準備、在金融制度健全的國家、銀行準備金的存數、大抵均不甚高、因爲準備金太多、資金陷於呆滯、也足以阻碍銀行業務的發展、况且外國金融市塲、信用制度發達、有貼現市塲及再貼現之調節、有「銀行的銀行」爲援助、又有票據交換所、節省通貨的準備、所以在歐美各國、準備金毋須太多、而在吾國則不然、信用制度還没有十分發達、舊習慣入人太深、最近雖有銀行準備庫及票據交換所的設立、可是創設伊始、組織未臻十分健全、效用也還不曾普通化、因此各銀行自身準備、應當竭力充實、時時保持充分的準備金成數、採寗多毋缺的政策、這様、内部旣已充實、當然不致發生恐慌、第二集中力量、金融業相互間有極密切的連鎖關係、决不是各個獨立的、因此金融業不佳、要力謀自身的健全的發展、同時更要集中及統一全體的力量、以謀共同的安定及發展、特别是在國難嚴重狀態之下、這種集中力量的需要、更爲明顯、如去年一二八事件中、上海銀錢業聯合準備庫、及最近票據交換所的成立、就是一個例證、這兩種聯合組織的創設、第一是吾國金融界一個　好的現象、不過因爲種種關係、組織還未能十分完善、卽如銀行業聯合準備庫、加入者不過二十六家、本屬一時的臨時應急的辦法、期限暫定五年、性質组織略類似於美國的聯邦準備銀行、可是去真正的「銀行之銀行、」却還很遠、因爲所謂銀行的银行、其必要條件、必須有具體的資本及統一的發行權、又如最近成立的票據交換所、每日平均票據交換總數、金額有五百萬元、張數有二千餘張、頗有相當的成績、不過現在上海交換所、其組合銀行、限於三十二家華商銀行及其分支行、凡外商銀行及錢壯與少數華商銀行、都不在内、服務範圍、也未能普遍、卽组合銀行收付票據、還有百分之五十、仍然照舊習慣、託人代理、與組合以外的銀行錢莊往來、也還不能利用交換所、以爲清償、由此看來、這兩種吾國金融界新興的聯合組織、基礎還没有十分穏固、因此我們今後應當仍然繼續努力、如聯合準備庫方面、果能够仿美國聯合準備銀行的辦法、各會員銀行、各自於存欵中撥出若干成、作爲聯合準備庫的公共資金、同時現在廢兩改元、已經實行、發行銀行、正可以增加發行、可以自提準備金、以鞏固準備庫的基礎、正於在票據交換所方面、應極力擴大服務範圍、務使能夠達到減少勞資危險、節省通貨、圓活金融、及增進金融業團結與互助的目的、這様、則金融業的力量集中、對外的抵抗力自然亦隨之增加、雖有風潮、亦可以應付裕如了、第三、維持公債價格、近年以來、公債發行很多、公債市塲、交易也極盛、如二十年成交數、計三·三四一·○○○·○○○元、二十一年也有九○一·七一○·○○○元、此種巨額公債、發行以後、一大部份爲銀行界所保持、因爲這些公債募集的方法、除少數爲直接募集、大多數則均由上海銀行界承購或抵押、據一般推測、銀行界持有公債總額、約爲百分之三十、若合銀行界本身所有的公債、加以各銀行發行保證準備内的公債合計、當然還不止此數、由此可見金融業與公債關係的密切、及金融界在債劵市塲中、勢力之偉大、近所我國時局不靖、債市常變動甚劇、債市漲落、銀行業的影響當然很大、如各發行銀行的保證準備内的公債、如果負有損失、還要以其他的財産彌補、於是損失以外、其他財産也因以呆滯、在基礎穏固的大銀行、還可以設法挹注、在此買賣公債爲主要業務的銀行、則資金往往因此周轉不靈、其影響所及、小則少數銀行受其虧損、大則足以發生金融風潮、所以公債價格的穏定、實在是金融界不可不注意在問題、第四、審慎放欵、自一二八事件以後、金融界受了很重大的敎訓、於是對於放欵採取很慎重的緊縮政策、與以前貪圖厚利的濫放、完全不同、這當然是一種很對的辦法、不過我們須知道、銀行的聯務、爲調節市面的金融、如果銀行拒絶放欵、則市面的金融呆滯、不僅百業爲之凋敝、有時實足以發生金融風潮、所以銀行在國家多事的時候、固然要慎重放欵、可是也不能亳不放欵、放欵以前、應當經過詳細的信用調查、放欵的標準、應當對人對物、因爲完全對人、則有時環境變遷、不能自維其信用、對物則市價漲落不定、要之銀行放欵、應當審查是否必要及是否安全、須以雙方都没有危險纔對、第五、避免投機、近年以來我國内地經濟破産、資金集中部市、資過有過剩的現象、而工商業凋敝、又無運用的途徑、在這種游資充斥的狀態之下、投機交易、當然活躍、如標金買賣、地産買賣、公債買賣·等、成交都極鉅大、還些交易、獲利旣厚、收回又容易、較之産業投資、當然容易吸引、殊不知獲利雖厚、風險也大、一旦投機不中、往往破産隨之、金融業據經濟的中樞、所以尤其要極力避免投機、以免社會被其連累、以上五項辦法、都是在國難期中穏定金融的要着、在平常時候没有外來壓迫、金融界同人、不妨隨便一點、但現在則不容隨便了、因爲現在是國家有存亡關键、也是金融業的生死關键、我們要救國、須得從本位上做去、金融業同人、如果能努力穏定金融的話、我想、對於國家、就是一個最大的貢獻、也可以説、挽救國難的最大責任了、上面所説的話、是我個人的見解、自已知道、學淺才疎、也許有不穏善的地方、希望聽衆們、加以指導與批評、如蒙賜教、請寄三馬路綢業銀行我當十二分誠意來接受的、完了、</p>

<p>從前在貴欄裏看到有一位向青君來信、主張到邊疆去，而貴記者的答復是「必須中國本部政治社會有了相當的清明，我們到邊疆去才有意義。」關於此事，我是同情於向青君的。不過，向青君的動機，是出于無力升學，和感到在中國内地尋工作做的困難而生，所以要去屯墾的事，是可以説，完全以個人的利益爲出發點，這似乎是没有什麽意義了，誠然，是一個畏難苟安，臨陣脱逃的人，不肯和不良的環境，作不斷的奮鬥，這是對於向青君抱着十二分的遺憾。的確，一般人的高呌着「到邊疆去」，意在以邊疆爲尾閭，容納本部失業的工農以和緩恐慌，這様的人，很對是一個柔怯之徒，不是黑暗社會的勁敵，將爲環境所制服的人們。　　因此我們應該把「到邊疆去屯墾」的目的認清，目光放遠，要把「屯墾邊疆」的事作爲振興國家的實業，和開發邊陲的富源，使我們貧弱的國家，臻于强富之道，然後而言開墾邊疆，和親自到那裏去開墾、才有極大的意義，否則也不過是個弱者而已。</p>
<p>關於屯墾邊陲的利金，大約有三點：</p>
<p>（一）「調和人口」，我們知道我國東南的人口，尤其是江蘇省，人口的密度，爲全國第一，反轉看到西北的人口，兩兩相比，真不啻有天壤之别；這様的密和稀，便變成了中國貧弱的主力，和五民族的不能融和，而發生了藏兵起叛的事情。</p>
<p>（二）「充實國防」年來邊陲多事，禍亂迭作，英國虎視藏邊，日帝國主義强佔東北，蘇聯的赤化，影響及外蒙，在這様的情勢之下，邊陲的被佔，是帶着十二分的可能性，時時有非吾版圖矣　危險，然而這事是不能忽略的，我們不能把整　的國土，讓那强隣一塊一塊的奪去：應該到那國人所不喜歡去的邊陲去，做屯墾的工作，藉以禦侮。</p>
<p>（三）「開發富源」中國不是一個真正的貧窮不堪的國家，皆因有了用之不竭，取之無盡的富庫，不肯去取和用罷了！所以到邊疆去的工作，第一是墾殖土地，發展農業，中國素來是以農立國，然而還要購買美麥，豈不是一件可恥的事嗎？有了偌人的地土，没有人去居住：有了那様富裕的邊疆，不想開發，除非是一般專想享現成福利的人，不肯别開生路，做些爲國家社會有密切的利益的事業。「邊陲多事」的確，但是，没有關内的同胞，移民到東北去屯墾，日本帝國主義强佔了三省以後，也不會遇到這許多的義勇軍做對敵，弄得疲於奔命：所以，没有人到邊疆墾屯，那英人進佔藏邊等，不是更加容易了嗎？况且邊防不充實，那强寇進佔的時候，連抵抗的人都没有，更遑論接濟捐欵了！義勇軍是正式的軍隊嗎？當然以前也有是</p>
<p>做屯墾工作的人，没有他們，不知要到如何程度，關外强寇的侵略國土·要説一定要等那政治明潔的時候，方可到邊疆去，那還不是待外人把邊疆奪了去，再想去屯墾，事實不是糟了嗎，屯墾邉疆，或許對於政治社會的清明，反而有促成的力量，至於「在内地謀生固然很難：到邊疆屯墾，更是難上加難」這一點，只要認清了目標，要是有利於人羣的事，什麽都可做得：難的一字，有志趣的青年的腦海裏是没有的。</p>
<p>所以，我以爲到邊疆去屯墾，不是不好的事，把去的目的認清就是好了。因而我要請先生把向青君提出來的「怎様到邊疆去屯墾」裏的問題，加以切實的答覆，也可爲一般抱着同向青君一様的志願的人，作爲參考和借鏡，實所幸甚。</p>
<p>答：足下來信擁護「到邊疆去屯墾」的主張，記者在未答復來信之先，要有一個聲明，我們不是絶對反對到邊疆去，而是主張必須在一定的條件之下，到邊疆去，才有意義。但是足下的三條理由却都不充分：第一，人口問題是經濟學上一個極複雜的問題，資産階級的經濟學者以爲人口有絶對地過剩之虞，於是有調節人口的學説，節調生育的學説，汰弱留强的學説，又有如足下所謂「調和人口」之移民政策。實則足下和他們一様，都是誤解了人口問題。中國的人口無論比之那個資本主義的國家的人口密度，都不能算是極密的。須知人口的絶對的過剩是没有的，只有相對的過剩。中國現在這種相對的人口過剩，是受資本主義的生産力的直接或間接所支配的。這話怎講呢？（一）資本主義的生産力增加了生産的量與速度，減少了勞動者的使用，於是而有城市工人失業的危機：資本主義侵入鄉村，造成了鄉村的失業，鄉村的破産，大批的失業農民流入城市，城市工廠因合理化的生産，抛棄了大批工人，於是就形成了産業後備軍：這就是近世資本主義社會的人口過剩的現象，中國也不能例外。（二）不過中國是一個帝國主義宰治的國家，因他的高壓與慘榨，中國的農村更是迅速地破産，加之他利用中國的軍閥官僚及一切統治者做工具，而他們帝國主義之間，又有劇烈的衝突，這種衝突也就反映在中國十餘年來的軍閥混戰這一事實上面，於是中國的農村更是一敗不可收拾。中國的人口過剩也就愈顯得過剩，中國的人口過剩不是中國貧弱的原因，即是中國的農村破産的結果，絶不是如你所設的「密和稀」的不調和的關係。至於「五族不能融合」「藏兵叛亂」等等更與這個問題不相干，五族之所以不能融合，一來是因爲中國的革命對於農村，不曾給他解决任何問題，對於各民族，也不曾給他解决任何問題，而貪官汚吏，土豪劣紳，軍閥政客，層層剥削，「如水益深，如火益熱」，近日西藏之稱兵，回民之叛亂，原因皆在此而不在彼。若果説人口稀不調和，便足以引起民族間的戰爭，那末，蘇聯的西伯利亞的人口稀少，而莫斯科與列寗格拉的人口稠密，未聽講因此引起他們的衝突？第二，「充實國防」之説也是似是而非。張學良父子在東三省，養兵數十萬，治軍二十年，軍實非不充也，東三省的人口非不衆且多也，然而爲什麽日本帝國主義如入無人之境？若説人口稠了就不致受人侵略，則有遼寗之例在，足下之説旣不可通。若説人口稠密便可不受赤化危險，那末，上海，東京，紐約等處都是人口極密的大都市，爲什麽也時時有赤化的危險？足下之説更不可通：可見禦侮第之道，亦在此而不在彼了。第三，「開發富源」這句話非常好聽。但是我要問你：誰人去開發呢？用什麽東西去開發呢？怎様去開發呢？一個人在内地或在工業大都市失了業，找不到飯吃，預備去到邊疆去去做「魯濱蓀」，如何可以聯想到什麽開發富源的問題。連中國本部都是田野不闢，赤地千里，又望誰去開發邊疆富源：而且在現政治之下，絶無開發邊疆富源可能：不然，便是與「某國合辦一是名，反客爲主，舉大好河山，拱手而讓之帝國主義，好了幾個掮客，葬送了國家主權，是實，研究社會問題，必須從實際情形着想，不可全憑一相情願的理想：不然便一無是處。</p>

<h3>報紙是舊的好</h3>
<p>— 赡廬</p>
<p>崇拜舊道德的，都説：「科學是新的好，道德是舊的好。」這是眼見舊道德破産以後，社會上發生種種不安狀態；所以如是云云。</p>
<p>喜用舊人的，都説：「衣服是新的好，人是舊是好。」這是眼見世上靠不住的人物，大半是初交不是舊友：若是舊友，我已知道了他的性情，斷然不會拆我爛汚；所以如是云云。</p>
<p>我近來有一個偏見，對於種種色色，人家以爲新的好；我都反對。人説：文章是新的好。我説：對的。人説：詩歌是新的好。我説：對的。人説：戲劇是新的好。我説：對的。人説：報紙是新的好。我便大摇其頭道：不對、不對，報紙是舊的好，新的不好。</p>
<p>這是我要聲明在先的：吾説報紙是新的不好，並非説報的組織不好，文</p>
<p>字不好，所恨恨的，只是恨着報的消息不好。報紙越是簇新，消息越是不妙，在這分上，便减少了我對於報紙的感情。</p>
<p>每逢上午，人人都爭先恐後的要看簇嶄新鮮的當日報、我却不願意看，　　要看前月的報，只爲前月的報，平津没有這般吃緊、而且，還有宋哲元殺敵的紀載。又要看前年的報、只爲前年報，九一八趴已起釁，而關内還可無事。又有馬占山嫩江之捷。又要看數年的報，只爲前數年的報，東三省還在青天白日之下，中華民國的土地完整，還没有被野心國打破。</p>
<p>報是舊的好，越向舊報紙裏追尋，越見得舊的局面勝於新的局面。説也好笑，我見了當日報紙的標題，便要發生不快，偶然在包銅元裏的一角舊報紙上，瞧見一段開闢葫蘆島行那奠基典禮的盛况，倒覺得津津有味，看了一徧還想看。爲什麽我對於舊報紙有這般的感情？連我自已也要有些莫名其妙。</p>
<h3>馬路目覩之一</h3>
<p>— 施子琴</p>
<p>不久以前，本埠發生一了椿越捕誤殺華人案。原因爲了兩個婦</p>
<p>人同座在一輛黄包車上。違背了章程，以致發生了衝突，閙成了這件慘案。這件事當時曾轟動一時、但現在已逐漸消沉下去，不聲不響，成爲今年上海小事情過去的陳跡了。</p>
<p>關於兩人同坐一輛黄包車，固然是有違定章，爲了維持章程和威嚴，的確是應當禁止的，但那安南巡捕用武器來威脅而釀成了這件命案，真太輕視了我們華人的性命了。</p>
<p>前天（二十日）下午從邑廟出來，行經大自鳴鐘附近，又逢到這様的一件事，兩個婦人給安南巡捕從車上趕下，那黄包車夫苦苦哀求，而這巡捕徧生不賣情，非拿去照會不可，正值紛擾的時候，事有凑巧，從西面來了一輛黄包車，載着一個妖艷的鹹水妹，坐在一個法國水兵的身上，做着種種淫蕩的動作，拉向這邉來，於是許多旁邊看閙熱的朋友喧譁起來，要那越捕上去干涉。這可把那越捕難住了，他不敢驅逐這法國水兵下車，祗有向黄包車夫出氣了，呌他停下，要拿照會。這黄包車夫果真停下，越捕正想去拿，那法國水兵縱身下車，推了他一下，操着法語向他「幹什麽」。越捕頓時目定口呆，不作一聲，縱肩摸了一下槍，眼看那法國水兵抱了鹹水妹上車遠去，連那起光的一輛也放過了。</p>

<h3>神農氏考略</h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>前日爲崇農節，有人詢吾神農氏爲　　何形狀者，廼稽諸古史，亦頗有足資紀念者，因述如次。</p>
<p>神農民，姓伊耆，一作祈，世以爲堯姓，實非，名軌，母安登，感神於常羊，生神農於列山之石室，今江夏隋縣北界，厲鄉村南重山也，考荆州圖言永陽縣西址厲鄉山東有石穴，高三十丈，長二百尺，謂之神農穴，神農生此，老子亦生於此，而神農長八尺有七寸，龍顏而大唇，生三辰而能言，五日而能行，七朝而具齒，三歳而知稼穡，般戲之事，必於黍稷，日於淇山之陽，求其民所喜之榖而藝之，知其可以養民，分地之利，因天之時。於是修火之利，而蒸民乃料，故以火紀時，而稱炎帝者以此。　　神農之爲政敎，曰「民爲邦本，食爲民天，農不正，食不充，民不正，用不衷，士丁壯而不耕，則受其饑，女當年而不織，則受其寒，」是以作耒耜。而農事始興，又嘗百草，乃立方書，兵家言「神農以石爲兵，且伐補遂」，則軍旅之事，亦因是而備，漢時猶有神農兵法一篇，此可證焉，至神農求雨，其説别出尸子，云「神農之理天下，欲雨則雨，五日爲行雨，旬日爲谷雨，旬五日爲時雨」，謂之神雨，而赤松子爲神農之雨師殆不可信，神農都於陳，今宛邱有陳城是其地，迨崩，葬長沙茶鄉之尾，是曰茶陵，今謂「天子墓」，有唐嘗奉祀焉，宋太祖夢神農，馳使節求之，蓋宋以火紀云爾，若曰「崇農」則非。</p>
<h3>廣告</h3>
<p>— 賢賢</p>
<p>新張之喜，須登廣告，「關店大拍賣」，也登廣告。「貨品增價」的</p>
<p>登廣告，「不顧血本，買一送一，也登」廣告。「結婚」，「同居」，登廣告，「離婚」，「拆姘頭」，也登廣告。「六十大慶」，登廣告，「出殯路由」也登廣告。「待聘」，「出租」登廣告，「聘請」，「徴求」」，也登廣告。「尋人」登廣告，「尋狗」，也登廣告。廣告之爲用，從這上面看</p>
<p>，也就大得可想而不可知了。</p>
<p>上面所説的，都是化了大洋錢而登的</p>
<p>廣告，此外還有不化錢而登的。</p>
<p>一切新聞都是義務廣告。例如謡傳看「ＸＸ華軍已撤退」明天，便有一則大標題的專電，聲明「ＸＸ軍仍在原防，」而且是「略有進展」。若是謡傳着「Ｘ案將直接交涉」，明天，又有「某公負責之談話」，證明這是空穴來風，不足置信。諸如此類，名雖新聞，實在都是不化錢的聲明廣告。</p>
<p>「ＸＸ」役，我軍大勝，斃敵十三，</p>
<p>俘獲更衆，計獲機槍一架，步槍二十餘支，軍用品無算，接着，便是「缺乏ＸＸ，希望各方接濟」。這是一種募捐廣告。至於「某公微有感冒，拒見賓客，」等新聞，更是十足「恕不招待」的廣告。　　這些不化一個錢的義務廣告，據説，老百姓是够不上資格登的。但是，據我看來也不盡然。「順源堂理髮店高丫頭子」這幾天，各報上正替他大登其義務廣告。「某處發現無名男尸一具」「汽車碾斃老嫗」，「强姦六歲幼女，」「路刧」金絲圈」，「吃黄魚中毒」「苦力中暑猝」倒一等免費廣告，更無一不是老百姓的事。可知道這種「義務廣告」的地位，也不是有地位的人，所得而獨佔的，不過有地位者「連打三個噴嚔」，都是廣告材料，老百姓可就没有這資格。</p>

<p>短篇小説</p>
<h3>寒山和尙（上）</h3>
<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>碧緑的水漸漸高漲，被騎着一幅蒲帆。趁</p>
<p>西風緊，從運河的那一端，駛近楓橋來</p>
<p>了。細雨下着，沙灘上的蘆花，像掛了一張白天鵝絨的氈毯，蓬騐地波動，是秋天的旁晚。岸上全是楓林，飛下一兩片紅葉、靜得有點肅殺。</p>
<p>瘦長的寒山和尙，這時候，正帶着樺皮冠，</p>
<p>赤着脚，在寺院子裏斫柴。把一件破碎的直裰兒高高吊起，拴束在闊的腰帶裏，很辛勤的工作着。突然聽得寺外有櫓聲韾，心怔了一怔，馬上丢掉斧，輕輕地説：「要不是拾得師真的來蘇州了。」便拍拍泥黏的雙手，撑着雨傘，這様匆匆忙忙的向狹仄的草徑上向水埠頭去。欵乃的櫓聲，漸漸近了。</p>
<p>没有運到水埠頭，一眼已看見來船纜在岸上一株秃柳樹上了。跳板上走過一個矮胖和尙來，那就是拾得。船夫在呌：</p>
<p>「拾得大師，怎不張開你的傘子？雨大呢！」</p>
<p>但不管這聲音是怎様關心，拾得只遲緩地回過頭來，感激似的看了一眼，又把鵝那様的一摇一擺的冐雨向前走了。白得閃光的秃頂上，有雨珠在上面跳躍。船夫莫明妙地笑一笑，把船也摇回去了。</p>
<p>拾得的影子，面貌，整個軀殼：次第映進寒山的眼裏。他很愉快，歪動嘴角，掛滿了笑容。「喲！有趣得很，你看他絶不瞧見我！」這様想，打算和他開玩笑，於是趁勢躱進路旁的楓樹林裏去，正像一隻夕陽光裏的駝背的鷺鶿，睜眼在偷看紅葉反映中走近來的肥鵝。一邊笑了。</p>
<p>然而拾得和尙依舊冐着大雨、慢慢地向前走：雨從他的光亮的頭上瀉下來，瀉到眼裏，肩上，背上，皂袍上，他似乎全不知道。脅下的油傘挾着，可是丨依然挾着。</p>
<p>楓林的落葉，攙着雨顆，成羣兒刮上拾得的臉，有幾片并且膠住了：他没有用手動一動，讓臉上膠得斑爛駁雜。雖然機械地走，却漸漸遠，離寒山寺不多路了。這使躱在滿林紅葉中的瘦長的寒山，看他濕黑的直綴兒，掛下雨珠，弄成狼狽不堪的様子；自已還這様尋他開心，倒不好意思起來了。不過爲什麽有了傘不避雨？楓葉黏滿了臉，又不設法拿下來？這簡直是獃！許多人就因爲要保持虚僞的尊嚴，以眼視鼻，那様目不斜視的規行矩步，由寒山看起來，那是不但在欺人，而又欺了自已。幹嗎矯揉造作得「與物無爭」，而苦惱自已的肉體呢！　「呸！可憐的鵝！」他開始對拾得感到一重厭惡了。不過只像摩豋青年厭惡老年人那様的程度。</p>
<p>雨依然繼續着，因風刮得緊：比先前更狂，</p>
<p>也更響了。凌亂有楓葉像紅蝴蝶，遍織入銀色的雨網裏，打落在拾得的周身，也打落在寒山撑開的油傘上。</p>
<p>鐵嶺關山舍裏已冐起炊烟，寒山寺也打着晚</p>
<p>鐘，一片蒼茫的夜之輪廓，迷漫了遠處，漸漸加深，像濃的蜃氣，波及近邊的楓林裏來了。，山中的夜色，的確比平原容易釀成。</p>
<p>經幾度思量的寒山，倒底忍住了孩子氣，跳出楓林、輕快地追在拾得背後。只要看他可笑的走路姿態，反覺得這様一個儍子，十分有趣味對着自已好奇的感受。就像愛瞧滑稽電影的人，抱着相同的情趣。丨雖然滑稽角色扮演出來的愚蠢，有着更悲哀的滋味伏在裏面的。　相形之下，寒山像雲雀那麽快，迫近拾得了。聽得出肥矮的他，重濁地在抽疲乏的呼吸，與肉的顫抖，這種老人的倦弱的様子，寒山的心有點苦痛了。用着同情的，友愛的。幾乎是憐惜的音調，趕上去呌：</p>
<p>「拾得大師，慢點兒走。寒山在此。」</p>

<h3>部際足球昨日兩塲血戰</h3>
<h3>新聞勝時報一球圓結束</h3>
<h3>申報能反敗爲勝民報悽慘</h3>
<p>漠漠的愁雲、拂拂的東風、清晨下了好幾幾毛毛</p>
<p>雨、倒使一班出塲作戰的老爺兵、擔了不少的心事、萬一雨阻、征人不能開火、豈不糟天下之大　、殭天下之大冰嗎、總算運氣、午後三時、忽開笑臉、市一塲經過了不壞事的小雨、塵土不揚、软平如席、正好操刀躍馬大殺一塲、</p>
<h3>新聞勝時報</h3>
<h3>新聞報三失良機</h3>
<p>新聞長於軟、時報長於硬、在形</p>
<p>式上固然難分高下、但硬者空容易殭、終於輪了新聞一球、然而「江北小五子」范敬五君、昨日輪送炸彈功在小心、「蔣忠義君險一些連」</p>
<p>龍頭水都興奮出來、不感謝他是無天理、時報之李庚西亦可人兒也、袪長補短、心細於髮、王孟年膽大腿快、爲新聞後防最畏忌之人材、邵翼之從容應付、臨變不亂、良將也、老滕形容餓虎、可惜昨天撲來樸去、依然没有撲到迷羊、無怪其摇頭大嘆曰、「口福不佳」、肉摶開始、新聞卽取攻勢、陳同松當機不斷、陸詒二度失脚、令人揑住一把冷汗、替時報發愁、</p>
<h3>蔣忠義擁進一球</h3>
<p>幸陳大凡奮勇非凡、劉健吾今吾</p>
<p>非故吾、邵翼之大刀闊斧、保守東南一角、北地胡兒不敢南下牧馬、范敬五、一脚踢出去、乖乖不得了、裴順元鼓噪而進、陸詒趁勢掩殺過去、蔣忠義是忠義堂上的傢伙、膽有天大與陳同松並轡闖入時報罰球區域、陳大凡抵抗不得、陸光杰變身衝出、蔣宗義連人帶球、搗人網底、勇哉、</p>
<h3>時報反攻無效果</h3>
<p>獨鶴先生鼓掌如雷、立卽允下願</p>
<p>心、如能將此雙皮球、保險不再失去、則明朝設筵慶功、果然、重賞之下、必有勇夫、范敬五球運亨通、絶不漏脚、裴順元也拿出喫奶氣力、預備明天多喝一盃、捕此勞悴、饒你老滕王盂年、如何厲害、　過三關、同時蔣兄忠義、與乃弟忠道亦不惜翻臉、作鬩牆之鬭、打成一團、山東大漢雷筱馥、與獨輪車夫胡老漢、曾有函較佳機會、均被輕輕逝去、光隂易去、銀笛忽鳴、</p>
<h3>新聞報陣容</h3>

<h3>時報陣容</h3>

<h3>申報勝民報</h3>
<h3>申報先失一城堡</h3>
<p>據説置身局外的</p>
<p>申報足球委員趙君豪、曾和孫道勝打過東道、如能勝民報四球、不折不扣、則致美樓預備兩席酒、同時幹事季致中也凑趣來上一個條件、祇要能進三球、居於勝利地位、則大慶舘請上一回酒、但結果却是二對一、趙季的洋錢没逃去、申報的戰士没口福、事情是這様的、申報雄心勃勃、各健兒腦海中滿充着酒菜的影象、作戰非常努力、相持七分鐘、民報大舉進攻、陳萬里對門力射、蔡慎夫選踢不得法、皮球作怪、倒滚人網先失一球、</p>
<h3>謝宏頭上成平局可不使老孫倒灌</h3>
<p>一盆冷水胖子錢華、更是傷心萬狀、休息後、陣線調動、蔣槐青調回把守大營有恃無恐、前缐將士放心進攻、江紅蕉善使李公拐、敵人見之膽寒、吳中一悶幹出色、五分鐘孫道勝面部起義、喊殺連天、頃刻闖進罰球區域、一脚傳中、謝宏霍地一頂、乃成和局、</p>
<p>孫道勝反敗爲勝　此際申報前線將</p>
<p>士、極形活躍、圍攻民報之門、緊聚不散、朱銘新三度傳中、惜無人接、應吳中一氣衝牛斗、左衝右突、银如牛魔、江紅蕉膽欲大、而心欲細、腿欲快而力欲大、三分鐘内、尙能保持半壁山河、庸知禍生不測、謝宏快馬加鞭、轉瞬闖過三關、不幸被絆馬索絆倒、孫道勝及時趕到、舉足射門、應聲人網、民報雖思講和、但不久、鳴金時至、</p>
<h3>申　報陣容</h3>

<h3>今日大戰閉幕</h3>
<p>六路老爺兵精神十足、自申報與新聞報在體育</p>
<p>塲開始、今日下午四時、時報與晨報仍在原塲終結、可謂有始有終、且值得報告者、時報球員中有因公離滬者數人、但决不計較勝負、特將凑足人數、依然與錦標有望之晨報一决雌雄、不甘棄權、非毛頭小夥子所能出、惟老爺兵獨具之特色也、晨報向未失利此次是否爲其功德圓滿之一幕、尙在不可知之間、加油打氣、端在雙方之努力矣、</p>

<h3>隨軍雜記</h3>
<p>唱倒吕戲、原是戲院中封廂時之應時劇、昨日本報與民報之賽、乃係本報在各報部際賽中最後之一次、因此主張實行倒串、讓全部正本老爺、在上半時内充作南天門值日功曹、並將本報内最稱痴肥的王冬瓜希濂、任守門大將、寗波冬瓜錢華、海門冬瓜兼毛毛雨萍、充作内衛、正是一隊三肥、堪稱胖陣、</p>
<p>昨日王希濂身穿西服襯衫、未加鈕、下穿黄短褲、足登　色　鞋鼻架眼鏡、居然掷起衫袖、露出半截玉腿、遠遠望見、好似殺塲上之劍子手、黄寄萍自從上次和時事之戰跌傷後、昨日跑起路來、兩手向後朝天、傴慺而進、賽在黑暗裏偷偷摸摸、並且偷學錢華絶技、居然亦用肚子擋皮球、蔡慎夫保駕有心竟釀慘案出乎意料、迨有天意焉、</p>
<p>下半時劊子手式冬瓜王希濂充任左鋒、頗有將功贖罪之心、滿臉横肉、殺氣騰騰、詎料一球飛來、打中瓜面、門牙雖未打落、但已摇摇欲倒、金華亭在旁爲其出了一身大汗、獨手將（一手受傷）故稱）孫道勝、奮不顧身、東蕩西掃、立下了汗馬功勞、謝宏先鋒、飛奔滿塲、過五關斬六將將保定了乾坤、莊槐青牛刀小試、頓便敵人喪膽、李尊庸陸爾强攻守兼備、令人望而生行不得也哥哥之槪、朱銘新長腿便於奔跑、二次攻門、吳中一大喊客氣些、江紅蕉死纒不放、一長一矮、因此發生戀愛、</p>
<p>四十分鐘倒串戲、唱得彼此滿身臭汗、結果一而軸戲碼、但是此次承體育塲棒球塲慨借塲地、沈回春張龍海兩君、担任裁判、汪劍鳴君担任義務記載、本報各委員顧問及幹　諸君、一番愛護、和各公司捐贈球衣球鞋等、本隊當永永的紀念、並感謝、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>從「填鴨」想到的話</h3>
<p>— 師石</p>
<p>前天晚上，一個朋友在一家津式館裏請宴·因爲來賓中多半是吃慣紛筆灰的敎書匠；於是談話的中心，往往會從極不相干的事件，不期然的牽涉</p>
<p>到敎育上，雖説這未免是「三句不離本行」，可是談自已身邊扣事，總比其他問題來得親切一點。</p>
<p>酒至半酣，堂倌拿著一隻用木叉叉着的肥大燒鴨，呈獻在客人們的面前，意思是請大家鑑定一下；然後站在旁側開始宰割，一片片陸續的送上席來，鳴味確實不差，又香又脆，大家都説好。</p>
<p>一位自稱爲饕餮博士的某君肯定的説；「這纔是真止的填鴨，絶對不是贋品</p>
<p>。因爲這鴨皮油而肥，和鴨肉的香而脆，便是真貨的確證」。他並很熟練的告訴我們關於填鴨的製法；據説填鴨是完全經過人工改造而成的。在平津一帶，有不少規模很大的填鴨工塲，每年春間，從各埠採購大批鴨子，起初飼以尋常食料，等到要實施填的時候，先以某種藥劑消除積食，繼即用一種特别配製的食料，以强迫手段儘量的向鴨肚内硬塞，俟其容量至極度爲止；然後禁錮在一處適當温度的暗室内，不使下洩，不給飲料，不透陽光，聽其僵臥數天；迨食料漸次消化而成爲多量的營養質素，牠們便被迫而形成一種變態的發育，在短期間内，就變成一種異様肥大鮮嫩的填鴨了。</p>
<p>「這是多麽具有象徴意味的事呵丨」當過十年敎師的某先生，似乎爲填鴨引起</p>
<p>了一個感慨，喟地説；「我們從事敎育，不也是整天的幹着填鴨的工作麽？社會上設立着的大大小小的學校，不都是填鴨工場麽？敎師們揑着一團所謂「學問」的食料向學生們的肚裏塞；谁會顧念到學生們的食量，對於這種食料能否容納？能否容納？誰又會顧念到當前的時代和社會，對於此種食料是滞需要？能否適應？敎師們祇是在若干的時期内致力其填塞工作，等到學生的肚子塞裏滿，便算盡了唯一的職責，這不是和填鴨工人把鴨填大的工作一様麽？至於父兄家長們急急地把子女送進學校裏去，目的也只是希望子女們的肚子裏多裝一些東西；混得一個鍍金的資格，或鍍銀的頭銜，可以在商品化的社會上增加一點身價，這和鴨主人把鴨子送進填鴨工塲，養得肥大鮮嫩，以求在市塲上沽以善價又有什麽分别呢？」</p>
<p>大家對於某先生的話哄然笑了，可是我却不自覺的陷入凝思是；同時對於現</p>
<p>時代的整個敎育問題，感到一種超乎空虚以上的悵惘，這個填鴨的比喻，固未免太刻薄一些；但鐵一般的現寳，是明晰地擺在我們眼前；我們能够找出一個理由來證明這是僅僅一個無稽的「笑話」嗎？</p>
<h3>小土豪（續）</h3>
<p>— 冰瑩</p>
<p>每天他都要來我們的房子裏玩，有時朋友來了，我們買點花生米招待，他總要望着我們埀涎；於是我們漸漸地由給他糖打發他走而命令「你走吧！」了，他是不計較的，聽了我們的話馬上跑出去，可是不到兩三分鐘又走進來了。</p>
<p>「這小土豪真討厭丨」只要我們説這麽一句話，他馬上就起反感，狠狠地望我們一下就走開了，於是從此我們常常用這個方法來趕走他，可憐他受了父親的影響到現在來忍受這些侮辱。</p>
<p>有一天我一個人在樓上練習打靶，槍聲一響他就呌了起來，「拍，拍，」他一面呌，一面和另一個七八歲的孩子走上樓來。我每放一槍，他呌一聲，等到五顆子彈完了，我問他：「我放槍你害怕不？」</p>
<p>「不害怕。」</p>
<p>「爲什麽？」</p>
<p>「不爲什麽。」</p>
<p>「你説放槍好不好？」</p>
<p>「不好。」</p>
<p>「爲什麽不好？」</p>
<p>「你説好，我説不好。」</p>
<p>「爲什麽你要説不好？」</p>
<p>「不知道，我只曉得放槍不好，」</p>
<p>這回答令我好笑而又好氣，可惜話出之於他丨一個没人注意而大家討厭他的小土豪口中，如果是蕭伯納説的，又要爲他大登其報紙刋物了。</p>
<p>他會説好幾句普通話，這是使我很慚愧的，我來到這里已經三個月了，本地話一句也説不好，我和他母親講話，好幾次是他當翻譯，慢慢地我不大討厭他了，爲的每次我從外邊回來，他總親熱地呌着：「小姐，你回來了丨」有時我故意用本地話問他：「你吃飽了没有？」「我吃過了，你吃過了没有。」想不到他回答我的是一口流利的普通話。</p>
<p>他不大出外邊玩，也許是怕别的孩子呌小土豪，整天在院子裏用小石子向空中抛，有時大聲呌着「開槍，拍拍拍。」　是一個春天的正午，我躺在床上睡午覺，忽然聽到樓下呌「衝鋒丨殺丨殺丨殺！」的聲音，我以爲有些小孩子在練習兵操，連忙爬起來去看，原來只有小土地豪一個人在那里自發命令，自吹號，自開槍：：</p>
<p>「喂，你幹什麽？」</p>
<p>「打仗，」他立刻回答我。</p>
<p>「和誰打？」</p>
<p>「和敵人，」</p>
<p>「敵人是誰，」</p>
<p>「是我。」</p>
<p>這又是多麽幽默，他在自已打自已！</p>
<p>人的感情是由思想支配着的，我們對於小土豪還有他的母親總没有好感，記得有次我和淑去她園裏扯了兩個大蘿蔔來，也不告訴她，而且説有什麽關係呢？她和同屋的一位很窮苦的老太婆常常吵架，每次都駡得老太婆眼涙雙流，自然我們是同情老太婆而憎恨土豪的老婆的，她的堂屋裏擺滿了金漆的數十年代的牌位，掛滿了金匾捷報，可是在這些東西的上面佈滿了蜂蛛網，堂屋裏堆滿了破爛的家具，鷄，鴨，兎，狗的屎到處都是。在五年前是一個堂堂乎威風凛凛的土地豪，而今只落得家破人離，不堪回首，呵，這是時代的演變，這是他們應有的命運。（一九三三·五·十三夜）</p>
<h3>蘧［廬絮語</h3>
<p>— 子展</p>
<p>（三十三）秀才的厄運</p>
<p>嗚呼！趙宋南渡之初，泰檜主和賣國，士論沸騰，不少獲讉者，可悲也。卒賴孝宗不罪狂言，秀才兑遭大厄，外禍雖云日急，國脈奉而稍延，予旣略言之矣。曾記儒林外史開端，述王冕夜觀天象，見貫索犯文昌，嘆謂一代文人有厄。些雖小説家言，願不遠於史實，蓋有明開國，朱元璋以善於投機，利用農民武力，濟之以文人智謀，坐獲革命之成果。彼知農民易欺，而文人難馭也，故屢興文字之獄，僇辱文人，藉挫其氣，且垂爲憲典，以貽子孫。嘗於洪武二年，詔天下立學，命禮部傳諭，刻爲臥碑，凡十二欵。其首重者有二：一，國家明經取士，説經者以宋儒傳註爲宗，行文以典實純正爲主。今後務須頒降四書，五經，性理，通鑒綱目，大學衍義，歷代名臣奏議，文章正宗，及歷代誥律典制等書，課令生徒講解。其有剽竊異端邪説，炫奇立異者，文雖工弗録。是秀才在統一思想之淫威下，已無學術思想之自由矣。一，天下利病，諸人皆許直言，惟生員不許。今後生員本身切已事情，許家人抱告。其事不干已，輒便出人衙門，以行止有虧，革退。若糾衆扛幫，駡幫官長，爲首者問遣，餘盡革爲民。是秀才在禁止干政之淫威下，已無言論行動之自由矣。顧天下之文人，非能長此終古，而不一爭自由也。是故有東林復社，先後而起，指摘朝政，掊撃官邪。然政府壓迫之也亦愈甚，乃至不惜盡　關外華北之地，拱手讓於敵人，獨於文人，不肯放鬆一步：黨獄未已，而南京之小朝廷亡矣。不謂滿洲代明，師其故智，鉗制士子，立法益嚴。順治九年，禮部題奉飲依條約八欵，頒刻學宫，謂之新臥碑。其滯塞文人之聰明，錮蔽文人之思想，固無論已。最後二欵、尤爲酷烈。一，軍民一切利病，不許生員上書陳言，如有一言建白，以建制論，黜革治罪。是言論自由之限制，較有明一代愈甚也。一，生員不許糾黨多人，立盟結社，把持官府，武斯鄉曲。所作文字，不許妄行刋刻，達者聽提調官治罪。是集會結社，以及出版，皆無自由也。益以康乾之際，頻有文字之獄，於是文人相率而爲考據，號爲漢學，以寄其心思，以窮其智慧。然考據所極，至於叛聖疑經，乃有康有爲之孔子改制考，新學僞經考。卒之引起維新運動，秀才雖不造反，舉子公然上書矣。繼有革命運動，黨人屠殺不盡，民國居然見　矣。嗚呼！祖龍焚書坑儒，秦不二世而亡。明清末造，迫害文人愈甚，而取亡愈速。前人不暇自哀，而後人哀之。此嗚呼派歷史家之所以恒秉嗚呼也歟！</p>

<h3>紅羅蔔鬚</h3>
<p>— Jules　Kenaro作　林取譯</p>
<p>紅頰三（續）</p>
<p>「先生，監學先生和我有着私怨！」紅蘿蔔鬚説。</p>
<p>「啊！他和你有着私怨！給你禁假八天，我的孩子！」</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚是知道對方的性情的。像這様的一種温和的待遇一點也不使他驚異。他已决心去</p>
<p>冐一切危險。他取了一種頑固的姿勢，兩腿併得緊緊的，就是要挨一記巴掌也不管了。</p>
<p>常常用手心去責打一個頑强的學生這事是院長先生的一種無可非議的癖好。被瞄準了的學生如果靈巧的話，便趁着巴掌還不會上臉時，把頭一低，讓院長先生跟蹌兩步使得大家忍笑不住。那時院長先生便不會再來第二下了，因爲他得顧全自已的尊嚴，不能像學生一様使用狡猾。他得一下撃中那選上了的一邊臉頰，或則放手不管。</p>
<p>「先生，」紅蘿蔔鬚是大胆而驕傲地説着，「監學生和瑪梭兩人幹下了一些暧昧事情！　　院長先生兩眼頓時幌亂起來，好像有兩隻小蒼蠅忽然竄進去了似的。他把兩隻緊握着的拳頭擱在書桌邊上，把身子抬起一半，腦袋伸向前面，好像要和紅纙蔔鬚撞個滿懷似的，他用着沉濁的喉音問道：</p>
<p>「什麽暧昧事情？」</p>
<p>這様一問，紅蘿蔔鬚便像手足措了。他本以爲院長先生會以巧妙的手腕，把一册很厚的著作，丨丨打個譬如，像馬爾坦（HMARTIN法國著名歷史家）的著作吧，丨丨向他面上擲來的，却不料院長先生竟向他查根問底起來。</p>
<p>院長等他回答。他頸根上的縐摺都合攏來成了一隻整個的肉箍，成了一隻厚厚的，滚圓的皮圈，這皮圈上面歪斜地安着他的腦袋。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚躊躇着，在要肯定自已没有説錯的時候，他却説不出所以然來。隨後，他的臉色突然暧昧起來，把背彎下，様子顯然現得呆笨而又窘迫了。他從兩腿之間，把绑弄得扁扁的帽子抽出，身子越發彎得利害了，他萎縮了，他把帽子慢慢地拿起來，拿到齊下巴那様高，隨後緩緩地，隂險地，帶着一種不屑的神情，他把他那猿猴似的頭腦埋在那裝着棉絮的夾帽裏，一句話也没有説。</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>當天，經過一番簡短的調查之後，威奥龍便被辭退了！他動身走時那情形是很動人的，差不多像開着送别會似的。</p>
<p>「我還還再來的，」威奥龍説，「這不過是暫時的離别籠了，」</p>
<p>但這是騙鬼的話。書院當局把他着做徽菌一様，已將他的職務委了人了。這不過是兩位監學先生一來一去的事。他和别的監學先生一様離去這裏，可是他比他們好，因爲他走得更快。所有的學生差不多全喜歡他。他們從没有遇着第二個人具有他這様寫練習簿封面丨例如某某的希臘文練習簿之類丨的手藝。他把第一個字母用一種寫招牌的字　寫着。學生都離去座位，圍住他的書桌。他那戴着一枚緑寳石戒指的漂亮的手掌，很雅緻地在紙上摸來摸去。他在練習簿封面的下方，替别人臨時造出了一個簽字的花様。這正像一塊石頭落得水裏一様，四圍全是波浪和逆濤，這些波浪和逆濤是由一些有規則的同時又異常夭矯的墨線組成，而這些墨線便是那簽字的最後一筆扭出來的。這真是一個小小的傑作。這最後一筆的末端消失在那紊亂的一團裏面，非是很近的瞧着，並用很多時候尋覓是不能發見的。不用説，這一切都是一筆　成。有一次他把墨線畫成亂七八糟的一團，名之曰卷末挿畫，使得那些小孩子們許久許久地驚歎着。（未完）</p>

<h3>糧食河下米到稀價提二角</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日來源計有常蘇南港青角松江西練平湖等帮二十餘號、蘇同帮南港厚粳及特貨中關薄稻本街店胃添備續湧、故初市以天氣隂霾、人心已見帶緊、後因來源無幾、市更活潑、價格横升、厚粳提起二角、特貨中關薄稻高漲三角、餘若松江及青角冲特大市薄稻全市共僅靠十儎、俱爲北平威海衛包胃去路、而售方見中關貨等零胃横提、故亦極力扳俏、但以客方嚴厲相持、祇提角餘、杜洋尖亦見帶高角半、變兀稍覺回起、隂元尙帶軟色、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日天宫隂濕、河下各帮來源念五六艘、白粳去胃稍化、市形高定中次緊起近尺、早薄稻到少銷平、價加數分、羊杜尖亦加數分、埠客尖亦帶緊象、白元平正、</p>
<h3>客秈帶緊洋米閩化活</h3>
<p>昨福州帮進胃又貪、客秈各檔均形帶緊、尤以</p>
<p>糙米較貪、價乃步俏太七分、洋米甬帮胃口亦貪、洋行報價不售、後由回籠貨售出小絞九百包、價仍爲七元七角、客秈糙米均爲閩帮辦去、計江西機晚六百七十二包、價八元五角七分至八元二角、機早一百七十包、價七元六角半、湖南機紅二百四十包、價八元一角一分、糙紅六百二十四包價七元二角一分、又糙油一千包、價七元半至七元三角七分、其他進出兩無、到頭不多、如閩化再暢、市當步砌、</p>
<h3>猛進鋭退之標粉麥</h3>
<p>粉市上午步漲下午步落、在晨間開市時因承前日之漲風、人心甚佳洋麥亦報漲五六角、市氣甚旺、各月份一致上升、較大一分左右及數釐不等、但大小各廠以存底充足、洋麥存到兩多、後首尙有到埠、乃趁機抛售、内地帮又以天晴新麥有豐收必要、亦在市抛賣甚力、客帮亦轉觀望、市乃步步下游、收市價本月小七五、下月小一分二五、七月小七五、八月小五釐、九月不動、十月小二五、</p>
<p>麥市交易甚旺、現麥亦有新到、市上做開磘　麥三百五十包一大車、價開四元三角　　半、比上週售價較大一角二分、又以洋麥報大、人心甚佳、標麥開市後一律上升、十月份大有九分之多、餘大二三四分不等、午後行家售出、價又突落、收市七九月各反小一分、八月大一分、餘不動、</p>
<h3>餅銷動豆市激昂</h3>
<p>豆餅昨市成交雖少、然市頗緊張、蓋客餅近日來源不多、抵埠開盤卽行售完、故廠餅去路不弱、其市亦步砌、致辦豆之胃見暢、市遂激昂、昨辦去正陽關豆六車、漲三四分、其餘各豆亦帶起二三分云、</p>
<p>[P南北貨厦橘餅久斷略升</p>
<p>厦門橘餅、前由十九兩降至十八兩、因此價難合、絶無續到、兹查號貨業已告罄、各行存亦有限、行盤呌高三四錢、市勢有趨緊之象、兼聞本廠餅價亦難鬆云、</p>
<h3>五金</h3>
<p>薄馬口鐵到狂銷滯</p>
<p>三十五磅薄馬口鐵、前以貨少銷繁、標準步步高陞、每箱怙至五十四元光景、近來交易則因霉令期迫、各客帮及廠家等均無需胃、惟到貨則重疊而來、標準因之轉鬆、計每箱開五十元、比前小去二元、但近來洋行現貨及掮客路貨、紛紛向市上兜售、以此推銷者愈多而購買者愈少、計每箱開四十九元、而昨交祗有二三十箱云、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>防空箭</h3>
<p>— 牛</p>
<p>飛機，大砲，坦克車，爲現代戰鬥品的最要武器，在這幾件武器的中間，尤其是飛機更爲重要，因爲飛機往來自如，憑空射撃，炸彈所至，玉石俱飛，其破壞性最爲慘酷，</p>
<p>所以各國現在拚命地發展空軍，準備實力，他日戰鬥時之慘酷殘暴，更要</p>
<p>百十倍於從前，歐戰時飛機雖已發明，但尙屬不多，故破壞能力，還不十分嚴重，至近年各國軍事家研究之結果，知飛機一物，關於戰鬥時效用甚鉅，故各國正在大量的增加，</p>
<p>但一方面預備空軍，一方面天然預備空軍之來襲，則防禦空軍，亦關緊要，但看各國防禦空軍器具，除高射砲之外，並未聞有其他絶好器具當爲各國防空之惟一難題這在各國軍事家和科學家尚在研究而未完成的一大缺點。</p>
<p>中國的戰具，除幾枝機關槍外，大砲，坦克車，本來絶對没有的，即有幾隻舶來品的飛機，亦是寥寥可數，關外本有三百我架飛機亦祇陳列爲裝飾品而不能作戰所以於九一八時一齊奉還了車洋人試看自九一八後，敵人到處横行無忌，如入無人之境要奉天就奉天，要熱河就熱河，要平津就平津，我國絶對一些没有抵抗能力，真是可憐，這不怪軍事領袖不去抵抗，其實我國軍備武器缺乏得可憐，</p>
<p>所以現在拚命地急了抱佛脚，到處捐募飛機，要成立空軍，但是有了飛機，不是就有用處，還須有人來駕駛，當一二八時，我國飛機，亦有多架，有的放在　橋，有的停在蘇州，但是没有一人敢駕駛出來，與敵人抵抗，結果還犧牲了一個外國人，旣是可憐，又是可笑，</p>
<p>但是不要緊，我國飛機雖是没有，而防空利的器到是層出不窮前年我國</p>
<p>的科學家發明了一種飛雷去年一個科學家發明了一種飛箭多是已經實地試騐多有良好的成績據二十二日漢口電，我國又出一位科學家發明了一種防空箭真是難得這様一而再再而三連續地發明防空的武器就是敵人的飛機如蜻蜓飛來真是何懼之有包你不是打得他們一個落花流水便是打得他們抱頭鼠竄而逃真是何懼之有這種新聞，非我杜撰，有電報爲證，</p>
<p>鄂人汪日昌，發明防空箭，二十二日在漢南洋烟廠附近營房空地試射，綏　　署警部均派代表參觀，共射二箭，成績良好，該箭製造簡單，藥力猛烈，　　高程爲四千米突，空炸三十米突，二十二日漢口專電</p>
<p>[P法寳救國</p>
<p>— 其然</p>
<p>這裏所謂「法寳」，並不是幻術家變</p>
<p>的戲法，而是生活的「法寳」。明白點説，就是「謀生的技巧」。</p>
<p>生活在這個世界，書不要怎様多讀</p>
<p>，文章也不要怎様做得好，可是，法寳就不可不盡力研究：因爲有了法寳，可以爲所欲爲，稱心償願，否則，快樂當然没有，説不定就是衣食住和行，都要找不着。人民如此，國家也如此。</p>
<p>讀書人有了法寳，就可成爲「大家」</p>
<p>：做官的有了法寳，就可成爲「長」：做兵的有了法寳，就可成爲「司令」：商人有了法寳，就可成爲資本家：農人有了法寳，就可成爲大地主：工人有了法寳，也可成爲資本家；呌化子有了法寳，就可成爲乞兒頭；强盗有了法寳，就可成爲大王：流氓有了法寳，就可成爲流氓頭；僧尼有了法寳，就可成爲大師；餘外，如江湖文武術士，相命占卦的人，都無一不是依賴法寳，才得生存。同時，國家有了法寳，也可成爲大國。</p>
<p>法寳高强的，收獲就豐富；法寳淺</p>
<p>薄的，收獲就低劣。所以大家，長，司令，資本家，大地主，頭，大生，大師等等也有高下大小的等級；江湖文武術士和相命占卦的人底收獲，也有多少的分别。司時，國家也有大强和次强的不同。</p>
<p>所以人們若要成爲丨丨大家，長，</p>
<p>司令，資本家，大地主，頭，大王或大師，都要先把法寳充實。同時，國家要强盛，也須充實法寳。</p>
<p>國家是由人民组織而成的。所以人</p>
<p>民的法寳高强，國家也就强盛。我國現在據説已到將亡的日子，若欲挽救，就須及速充實人民的法寳。明白點説，就是應該迅即設法擴充我們的大家，長，司令，資本家，大地主，頭，大王，大師等様人材。</p>
<p>至於怎様擴充，那得請許多這類專</p>
<p>家來開個盛大的會議。</p>

<h3>桂英的命運</h3>
<p>— 蘋</p>
<p>李老頭子和陸姨太太把生意談好了之後，瞞着桂英，懷起三十塊雪亮的銀洋，含了兩眶熱涙，一道青烟般的溜了。</p>
<p>陸姨太太轉過背來，望了坐在桌旁</p>
<p>吃飯的桂英，心頭也隠隠或到悽慘；但是她想跟了我不比跟討飯的爺强過嗎的時候，十而打量着桂英，苗條的身材：滿討人歡喜的臉袋，雖然黄瘦貧血色，祇要有好的飲食，就能豐滿鮮艷。陸姨太太越看越愛，覺得這個丫頭買得真不錯，説不盡的滿心喜歡。</p>
<p>「桂英，你不吃了嗎」？陸姨太太見桂英擲了筷子，目光向四處探望，笑着向她。桂英却没有理會太太的善意，縐起眉毛，聲音微啞的問：</p>
<p>「我爸爸呢」？</p>
<p>「你爸爸？桂英，你爸爸没有飯給你吃，没有衣給你穿，要他要什麽丨你瞧這裏多好，有飯吃，有衣穿，還有高大的洋房住：：：</p>
<p>「我：爸爸：呢」？桂英簡直没有聽太太的話，跥着脚，小手揉着眼皮，哭了起來。</p>
<p>「爸爸：呢」？</p>
<p>太太心上一惱，臉上的笑容收歛了，惡狠狠的啐她一口：「賤種，吃不得飽飯的賤骨頭：你爸爸賣你在這裏了！太太恨恨的向桂英額前打去。</p>
<p>「呀：爸爸：呀」：：</p>
<p>桂英雖是一個乞丐，但從未見過這般猙獰的面孔，也没有受過這般惡狠狠的打駡：她更知道爸爸把她賣了，就狂哭起來。這更使陸姨太太生火，她想「出了錢還嘔氣，不把點顏色給小雜種看，她也不知道做太太的厲害」丨她便舉起蔑皮向她威嚇。</p>
<p>「再哭，老子打死你這賤種」丨</p>
<p>八歲的桂英　得什麽「老子」，見太</p>
<p>太這様兇神惡煞的要打她，哭的更厲害，一壁喊着「爸爸」一壁往門外跑去，太太趕上去一手抓住　的小頸，往厘内一摜，她一個筋斗，陸姨太太恨不得一口把她吞噬，舉起蔑皮在她身上亂打。　　太太手中的蔑皮折了，桂英從殺猪一般的呌得聲音嘶啞，一抽一噎的在她上蠕蠕爬動。</p>
<p>「太太，你息息火，天氣這般熱，」氣出病來犯不著丨這賤種祇有討飯命丨太太，房裏去，我打臉水來，太太，房裏去：老媽子做好做歹的勸太太進去。　　「賤種丨」</p>
<p>也就最需要拉。開會選舉時最要緊的是拉票，在一般的場合上丨丨在野成已上台，則需要拉人拉轉團體，捧喝擁戴。這辦法原也是互相利用，同登官域，然後是優哉游哉，變此永生。</p>
<h3>拉的三部曲</h3>
<p>— 炳</p>
<p>前奏</p>
<p>咱們貴國，真有些古怪，行軍要拉夫，娼寮要拉客，大人先生們想上台做官，更要拉票拉人拉團體，望文生義，被拉者是處於勉强地位，而拉之者却是事實所必需，大有非拉不可之槪，於是乎拉之一字在字典中，特别放大，特别映目，而拉的活劇也就來得特别起勁生色。</p>
<p>第一部</p>
<p>話説咱們貴國的軍隊，第一最愛錢。行軍拉夫，還是次套的活把戲了，在江浙，總之在交通較爲便利的省份，這戲法還不怎様倡行，爲的是有火車輪船給他們裝運，也就無須乎屬勞於笨拙的挑夫。若在敝湖南，據作者所見所聞，真是盛極一時，行軍一到，當然首先是花様多着的捐錢借欵，其次便是雇夫，因爲雇夫多少要給點錢，或竟少不敷用，於是索性隨他强拉，嚇得鄉民村婦，　咷逃命，畢竟每次總被拉去許多，拉去之後，有的連回響都没有，那自然是由夫上升了兵，餵了砲彈；或者是在大軍之後，給流彈枉送了命。十五年革命軍過境，説是不拉夫，喜得鄉民村婦額手稱慶。但去冬我冋去，聽説近年的革命軍也拉夫了，而且拉得更厲害，這是一部謎曲，怎麽革命的軍隊他拉起夫來了呢。</p>
<p>第二部</p>
<p>在下未到上海以前，就飫聞四馬路青蓮閣的盛名，説那兒是導演我這第二部曲的唯一場所；但旣到之後，前去觀光觀光，却有點「盛名之下，其勢難副」，的感想，有的只是紮褲脚的揚州姑娘，這大槪是因該閣幾度改組，生意日瀕衰落，而又大英地界的當軸頗有點反對公娼的横行，厲行取締所致。好在法租界有意繼承，在東新橋西新橋等一帶地段，每當夕陽西斜，紅燈初上的時候，幾乎全是紅緑姑娘們在活動，妖治，撒嬌，眉來眼去，百股的勾引顧客。夜深了，還有不少在鵠立着，伊們怕不了嚴寒酷暑，急雨暴風，這是命運註定了伊們要挨苦，或是賦質不艷，或是年老色褪，所以雖然百般的勾引顧客，還是得不到「悦已」的顧客，於是乎伊們只有施用强拉的手腕了，幾多過路人丨傻瓜或上道地的鄉下人，被伊們幾個，一個亂子槓去了，剥得精光，其目的在雪白的銀洋錢，你要不要作某種排洩，伊們並不怎様在乎。這顯見得伊們的拉，倒是一種「苦」。但畢竟是我們的畏途，我每去那兒地方訪朋友，晚上回來，總要抓個朋友護送，爲的是怕伊們那種可憐的麻煩丨拉。</p>
<p>第三部</p>
<p>前在學校裏便欣賞　這類曲子，每届學生會改組，那些有政治背景的同學們，真是忙煞了，幾天以前，便要從這間宿舍穿進那間，其目的不必細表。臨到開會了，我們這輩儍子的耳鼓裏，時常會傳來嗡嗡的「帮帮忙」！的聲音，這時在發選舉票了。却説這部名曲，還要推「官場」中最爲風行，爲的是在中國做人，只有做官才是人生的真義，才不會辜負七尺之軀。倘能「拉」，而又能「官」，便不難由貪汚，賄賂，私　吞，進而至汽車，洋房，摟妻擁妾的享樂，所以一股同胞二兄，最愛上什　「象牙之若一」</p>
<h3>上海社會的種種碼子</h3>
<p>— 慎敏</p>
<p>胡老碼子</p>
<p>五方雜處人類聚集的上海社會。一切的一切。在在使人有些莫明其妙。種種笑話奇談。就發生在那兒。</p>
<p>有一般白相人式的寫意朋友。他們的口頭禪。往往稱女人爲這隻寡老。稱老婦爲老蟹。稱男人爲胡老碼子。這種奇談，不知何人所發明的。也無從查考。大槪這個胡老碼子。是擅長胡調寡老本領的。所以稱之爲胡老。但是這胡老之稱呼。還帶着三分吃醋的意義。其中尙有其他的情節在内。至於碼子兩個字。無論在什麽地方時常聽見他們説。這擋碼子。那擋碼子。吾記得從前有一位著作大家。呌作九二碼子。他的作品是很有價值的。所以碼子這兩個字。是雅俗通用的。吾現在來變通一下。姓張的不妨用弓長碼子。姓李的可用木子碼子。姓楊的可用木易碼子。姓余的可用人未碼子。姓同的不妨用圈吉碼子。姓陳的不妨用耳東碼子。比較普通人士稱張家裏。李家裏等方言。這來得寫意一點呢。</p>
<p>壽頭碼子</p>
<p>士頭士腦而帶着一種頑固不開化的人物。呌做壽頭碼子。有一般富有而吝嗇。視錢若命的朋友。他們不捨得吃。不捨得用。只管勤勤懇懇。急急忙忙。漲田漲地漲人家。將所有的財産。情情願願。給他的兒孫揮霍。真所謂爲兒孫作牛馬。辛苦了一世。還有人賜他一個壽頭碼子的雅號。</p>
<p>滑頭碼子</p>
<p>上海地方。爲滑頭碼子的出産地。他們思想和手段。比衆不同。不吹牛皮而袁頭進賬。大拍馬屁而誘人入彀。滑頭滑腦。滑手滑脚。滑到那裏。是到那裏。滑到了無可再滑的時候。那末他們就要滑脚逃走了。尙有一般奸商。將仇貨改頭換面。大賣其滑頭劣貨。大做其滑頭交易。這種滑頭碼子。只圖目前小利。不顧家破國亡喪心病狂的奸商。不知滑到何時。才肯罷休呢。</p>
<p>吃精碼子</p>
<p>只進而不出。只貪便宜而不肯上當有朋友。大槪都是吃精碼子。他們非但對於公益慈善救國捐等不肯挖腰包。而且還要假公濟私。將他人捐下的汗血之資。大揩其油。飽入私囊。還有一種人。將民脂民膏的精華。搜刮殆盡。使民衆精神疲乏。農村衰落。他們惟利是圖。賄賂公行。這種天字第一號的吃精碼子。大槪是註册過的。所以没有人和他作對的。</p>
<p>癟三碼子</p>
<p>癟三碼子的大本營。大槪都在鄭家木橋附近。他們的面龐。像乾癟橄欖。他們的衣服。像甩癟燈籠。他們的衣袋。是癟的生司。所以他的雅號。呌做癟三碼子。他們的工作約有數種。一種是靠捉蟋蟀「拾香烟屁股」。度日的。一種是靠跟梢討錢度日的。一種是靠吳淞江兩，岸扶着黄包車得到一枚銅元度日的。但是靠倒冷飯度日的。也不在少數。所以包飯作裏送飯司務。見了若輩。是很討厭的。而且都敢怒而不敢言。假使送包飯的擔子上。所剩的冷飯殘羹。不被他們包圍而倒盡者。未之有也。他們的公館。大都在街頭巷尾弄堂之旁。到了夏天。在馬路兩邊露　者。比比皆　　唉。號稱天堂的上海。這種光景之下。</p>

<h3>回去守家當好麽</h3>
<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>我現在在一家書店裏服務，月薪不</p>
<p>多，除自已的用費外，没有錢寄回去：家中因爲近來捐派很多，入不敷出，也没有錢寄給我。我家有四百多畝田的遺産，每年把租榖售出去，照現在的情形，可得二千餘元；其他的活動産，一點也没有。我的大哥，在軍界服務；家事由我二哥管理。近來我二哥來信，總統家中擔負很重，難以應付，要把家産分開，各管各的爲好。我的意思，想把家産分作五份，弟兄各一份，父母一份，把一份以每年的收入來辦地方的慈善事業；你以爲對不對？若做慈善事，又做一些什麽爲好。還有一層，若把家産分開了，我勢必要回家去管理家事，豈不是把職務業了嗎丨這幾種問題，如何解决；先生的經騐是很宏富的，務望賜敎，敬候</p>
<p>撰安　龍長瑞</p>
<p>編者按；龍君對於家産的分派，能够</p>
<p>顧到父母，能够顧到社會，見解極是。望照此與賢昆仲商量，倘能徴得同意，照此辦理，也可以在鄉間樹一個風氣。至於辦些什麽慈善事業，那末足下與你長兄　，旣都不在家中；而且每年四百餘金的數目，也不能獨創一種新的事業；大可托你二哥經理其事，不過每年要伊造一份報銷罷了。</p>
<p>不過你説分家之後，要回去管理家事</p>
<p>；這一層斷乎試不得，不説這每年四百多金的收入，不够你的開支。即使收入可以維持開支，也是不行。一個人貴乎自立，靠祖上父的蔭庇，丈夫不爲也。好在你的父母健在，可以托他們經管，將來還可以托令兄代管。彼此劃清界限以後，他也不致於拒絶。寗可不要家産，事業不可不做。</p>
<p>小説</p>
<h3>五姬的一生（十八續）</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>十六酒</p>
<p>柳姑娘十分懂得；無論如何，自已生活中總還不能缺少他們，因爲他們畢</p>
<p>竟是她的最好的主顧。特别是這政府大員和銀行界的權威者，更不空許她稍許疏忽。於是她得重新裝飾起來，在兩頰敷上重重的胭脂，多少掩飾了那種怕人的蒼白。並且爲了更加動人起見，於是她穿起那件最近做好的摹本緞夾襖，那高而且大包住了雙耳的馬鞍領，由於那櫬底的紅緞子的光輝，反映在雪白的臉上格外緋紅。</p>
<p>當她走到外房的門檻邊的時候，顧經理首先看見她，連忙向蘇部長丢一個</p>
<p>眼色，自然是敎他停止談話，不過蘇部長却滿有把握的滿不在乎，一面風騷的向她做一個鬼臉，一面對顧經理繼續説：</p>
<p>「没有關係，反正大家都是一家人：：：你聽我説：中國的事絶對不是你」</p>
<p>我幾個人可以弄得好，也不是一兩年以内便可以强盛起來的。不看罷，中國地大物博，外國人那一個不想來佔佔便宜，清朝的八國聯軍便是最好的證明。假如那時真的和外國兵打起來，用槍刀去抵擋洋人的大砲长想想看，恐怕中國早已亡了哩。幸而當時還是議和，全靠外交力量，總算是將這老大的中國留到了如今。所以識事務者爲俊傑，像李鴻章那流的人物，到底是不可多得的人材。　　滿滿的一杯酒從嘴裏倒下。</p>
<p>就蘇部長説話的神氣看上去，很可以知道他對於國家大事，究竟是非常熱</p>
<p>心。即就其説話的才能而論，也是非常少有的。無疑義的，他是當時最有名的外交家，有多少和洋人往來的公文條件，都要經過他親手簽字才能發生効力。這是何等重要的人物。這些都是柳姑娘看得最爲清楚而且暗的引爲榮幸的，因爲仔細推敲一下，自已便是這數一數二的中國大人物的情婦的原故，而且有幾次在床上，她也和他談得如此如此，這般這般哩。尤其是剛才他説的「大家都是一家人」的一句話，可見得他並不將柳姑娘當作外人，也可以説很是寵愛，像這様的繼續下去，將來對於國家大事，少不了也可以挿入一脚。</p>
<p>她一想到這裏，立刻覺得很有希望起來，於是再坐上原位靜看着蘇部長嘴</p>
<p>唇的動顫。</p>
<p>「所以，我以爲就目前的中國的地位而見，到底應當極力提倡中日親善。」</p>
<p>固然日本也不免要在中國多少佔點便宜，可是你要他幫助我們立國，也就難免要破費一點的。」説着，端起酒杯又吞了一口。只見顧經理也夾了一箸香腸往嘴裏送去。説</p>
<p>「老兄所説的固然是極。不過中國的事却不大好做，在目前一般國民對日」</p>
<p>本恨得要命的時候，假如中日親善太呌響了，未免也有不便，譬如爲了二十一條件，曹汝霖章宗祥還不是白白的挨了一頓。老兄，你覺得對嗎？」</p>
<p>「哼，可不是，」蘇部長以手指劃着桌子説：「然而這也不可一槪而論。你</p>
<p>要知道二十一條到底是過於喪權辱國了，這不是袁世凱想做皇帝也不會有這様的事情發生的。」</p>
<p>這次的談話，繼續了很久，聽的人也少不了要厭煩起來。到後來柳姑娘簡</p>
<p>一次又二次的打呵欠了。</p>
<p>忽然門外起了一陣么喝聲，有誰在高嚷着要進來。結果武貴走去，一買</p>

<p>好萊塢有一位化裝天才，每年電影明星和摩豋女士豋門求敎的，多如恒河沙數，最近他　　在世界電影叢書上面，發表了一篇關於化裝術的文章，敝人特拿它迻譯出來，寫在下面　　，献給那富有愛美觀念者。</p>
<p>現在我能够有一個機會，告訴你們爲什麽要發明那「調和顏色」的化裝方法，這是一件很有興趣的事！我當初的目的，是要造成一種化裝品，使得全世界的女子，都能隨心所欲，改頭換面，變成一個美人兒。我在過去的三十年試騐經過之中，每年有整千整萬的女人跑來請敎我，我也很盡心盡力的把她們原有的缺點掩飾掉，走向十全十美的途徑上去。</p>
<p>這句話大約有十年了！一天我在一所大攝影場的化裝室裏，第一次運用我那研究已久的「調和顏色」去替一位著名明星化裝，並且把這種化裝術的妙處，解釋給她聽。她因爲這是新的方法，好像非常懷疑似的。後來化裝旣畢，跑到那燈光閃耀下的鏡頭跟前，導演見她容光煥發，不覺注意起來，等到開麥拉開始轉動後，她自已也好像認識我的試騐是成功了。再等片子攝就送到映片間去，放射到銀幕上的時候，那明星面部的美麗，竟非常自然可愛，我自已也不禁驚異起來，自信我的發有是成功了。</p>
<p>從此以後，我又把「調和顏色」的化裝品，推而廣之，使普通女子亦能應用。雖然日常裝飾和攝影塲裏的化裝微有不同，但是成功則一。好萊塢的化裝，是利用化裝品去增加天然的美麗。這種化裝品，必須和固有的顏色，有十分準確的和諧。使用之後，方才能够天衣無縫的和原有面色粘附一起，成爲一種天然的美。我的化裝，雖然在日光之下，也不能看出這是人造的。　　化裝和畫像相仿，唯一的條件，都是要把面部的影子表現出來。必須先具粗形，然後加以潤色，使它深淺均匀，式様美觀。眼鼻嘴唇，均須顧及，不能稍有疏忽。而對於長面孔，你就應該設法縮短其長度。要是圓面孔，你就必須把它做成橢形，因爲橢圓形的面孔，是比較要美觀些的，我以爲，如果你知道正確的方法，和所選化裝品的顏色，能够與你面孔上原來的顏色，非常和諧，那麽化裝並不是一件十分艱難的工作。換句話説，倘使顏色不調和，你再有通天的本領，化裝起來，决不會十分自然的。（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「紅粉之仇」</h3>
<p>— 明</p>
<p>這片的故事是説一位奇怪的紳士賃住在　個女郎的家裏。當地發生了不少謀殺女子的慘案，兇手雖經官方查出是一個異國的瘋人，但是無從逮捕。奇怪的紳士，和女郎發生了戀愛，她的舊情人新聞記者，極爲憤恨，恰巧她的父親懷疑紳士，因爲不但他的容貌和官方能發表的兇手相似，而且他每夜出去的時間，也和慘案發生的時間相近，新聞記者便以這個嫌疑作爲證據，報告官廳，但是捕到以後，又被逃走。不久，他密約了女郎到公園去，因爲有一個流氓侮辱她，他把流氓殺了。</p>
<p>我對於這個影片，發生極大的疑問，劇本上没有明白的表示紳士到底死了没有？他爲什麽不殺那女郎？流氓的出現，對於劇本有何關係，爲什麽竟藉他作了閉幕的關鍵？這幾點，真是呌人如堕五里霧中</p>
<p>導演大體上，的確有非常活潑的手</p>
<p>腕，全片組織極有統系，而且用多數謀殺案情的報紙，引出了紳士，這種地方，尤可見出他思想的巧妙，又利用諧趣的穿挿，以免觀衆感到枯燥，不過缺憾也不少，例如紳士能跳窗逃走，而不能破自已的手銬，法庭之中如同兒戲等都不像話，同時劇本的欠缺，他不設法補救，也太疏忽了。</p>
<p>技巧上，以攝影最好，許多畫面的</p>
<p>輪廓，充份的帶了圖案美，特别對於樓梯的俯攝。光線多用隂暗，帮助了不少神秘緊張的色彩。佈景平平。收音也清晣，不過對白太多。</p>
<p>主角作紳士的亞爾諾凡羅ＬＶＯＲＮＯＶ</p>
<p>ＣＩＣ表演非常動人，他殺死舊伴以後的後悔，更見深刻悲壯，這様一個善於内心表情的演員，英國片中，實不多見。</p>
<p>飾女郎的ＥＩＪＡＡＢＴＴＨＡＬＬＡＮ也很活潑天真，她表示一個意志不定的女職員，恰到好處。其餘配角，多半以詼諧出之，不其生色。</p>
<p>曼麗璧克福李思廉霍華德合演「秘</p>
<p>密一的一幕今日起在光陸蘭心開映　　劇情雖離奇，但也算人之常，不過</p>
<p>意義却没什麽，至多爲犯罪求解脱而已，脱寫新聞記者的無聊，與庸俗市儈相差無幾，近真是影片界觀點的錯誤，同時這片子也述到偵探的飯桶，主見也不正當。</p>
<p>至於片子以外的歌舞，和上次的大</p>
<p>同小異，而且並没什麽料彩，所以不談了。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>觀「前程」後的感想</h3>
<p>— 徐海容</p>
<p>這張片子，故事雖然是很平凡，可</p>
<p>是意識却極好，牠是暴露出現代女性的　點，而指示至給她們以一條應走的途徑，牠是在告訴一班愛好虚榮不務實際只圖享樂依頼男子，不願刻苦以謀獨立的女性，都應該有一個澈底的覺悟，封建制度是崩潰了，舊式思想是打破了，時代是已經進展到一個和從前不同的新的潮流中了，女子已不可再苟安享樂來依靠男人了。如果你自已不願操勞，不謀自立，那末結果一定會使你遭遇到莫大的痛苦，近年來報上不時的有男子遺棄女子使女子徬徨無計的新聞揭載出來，這就是一個很明顧的例子，事實同鐵一般的擺在你們的面前不容你們否認的，太太小姐們，醒醒罷，你們再不要放棄自已的責任了，你們應該拿出自已的氣力來工作着。以謀自已生活的獨立，如果你們不信我的話，那末就請你們跑去中央看一看這張「前程」。</p>

<h3>攝製「生機」的經過</h3>
<p>— 菁主</p>
<p>在這被稱爲「電影年」的一九三三年開</p>
<p>始以後，中國的影壇騾形活踴起來，而且，在製作上顯示出了國産電影的朝氣。聯華的「三個摩登女性」和「都會的早晨，」與明星的「狂流」等，便是在這種富有青春力的親氛中孕育出來的。我們知道這幾部影片是因其有前進的意識與社會敎育的意義，而受到了大衆熱烈的觀迎。同時，更由這幾部片的産生，與佳果的獲得，確定了國産電影今後所應走的路線。</p>
<p>在這種情形底下，位居中國製片公司</p>
<p>中三巨頭之一的天一，當然也「有動於中」的走上了國電影今後所應走的路啊！</p>
<p>中個初春的季節，雪花　着兩點在空</p>
<p>中飄蕩，天氣冷的像嚴冬，天一公司裏面的小客廳，圍坐着那老板，湯曉丹和一個外來的客人討論了很久，便把這「轉變作風」的新的製作「生機」（原名）「女工程師」）的攝製决定了。</p>
<p>因爲這「生機」，不［祇是天一「轉變作風」的新作，而且是天一在一九三三年的大製作，因此，那老板便自已負起導演的責任，並决定由陳玉梅，袁美雲担任女主角，男主角係張振鐸題材原爲提倡女子職業與無線電事業，内容原有無線電工廠及電台等場面。及後來因無線電工廠改爲縫纫工場，故無線電台等場面也被取消了。這部片子，經過了二個月努力丨大家同心協作，終於在邵導演的指揮之下完成了。</p>
<p>這是「生機」攝製的經過。</p>
<h3>好萊塢騎脚踏車熱</h3>
<p>— 有荃</p>
<p>最近好萊塢地方，有許多電影明星</p>
<p>，喜歡騎脚踏車，因些那地方的許多人，一時都喜歡踏起脚踏車來了。社會上的交際花，嘗在夜裏騎過那脚踏車，差不多就成了每一個人都要爭奪的恩物了。</p>
<p>「我潤自從小高而夫盛行以來，從</p>
<p>没看見過這様熱烈的情形」。一個脚踏車同業公會裏的秘書説：「但這是一定的，美國的製造者，應當製如歐州的式様輕巧的脚踏車，這種車比較的容易駕駛。」</p>
<p>喜歡踏脚踏車的明星，有下列幾個</p>
<p>：羅克的夫人台維絲女士，瓊克勞馥，瑪麗潑蘭沃絲脱，海倫德維惠脱連斯，非立斯立琪惠，琵琵妲姚兒，華納貝斯脱，華脱海斯頓，甲克霍爾，康霍娜琪，弗倫克飛，與約翰鮑爾斯等。他們在好萊塢騎，亦在瑪里勃海濱騎的。</p>
<p>這一種游戲的犯熟，竟波及到聖達</p>
<p>琵琶拉地方，那地方有一個八歲的運動家，竟把他的褲子賣給了一個七歲的朋友，而掉換一輛脚踏車，但這一個賣買，被那七歲的孩子的祖母，呌了警察來把它取消了。</p>

<p>「很好，親愛的，我不過想您或者還要曉得我仍舊愛您哩丨我是永遠愛您的丨」他的手臂痛着要去擁抱她，緊緊的擁抱着她加以愛護。但咬着嘴唇，他轉身悄悄地去了。　　他這一來一去似乎把那閉塞住少女孤獨的芳心的冰塊打破了。她在密娜安慰的懷抱裏痛哭一場，當場那老婆婆懇摯的説他會再來的，她便覺得突如其來的希望又在展　它的肢膀。</p>

<h3>Military Aspects of the Ceasefire Negotiations Not a Problem</h3>
<p>Diplomatic Aspects Still Under Discussion, Dangerous Period in Beiping Has Passed</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yesterday and today, no fierce battles occurred on any front, entering a state of ceasefire. Both sides have indeed had substantial contact regarding peace. This contact is limited to a military ceasefire and does not imply any compromise between the two sides. It is solely for military negotiations and does not involve diplomatic issues. The mood in Beiping has gradually stabilized yesterday and today, and the number of citizens leaving the city has greatly decreased. In the past few days, the East Railway Station sold more than 25,000 yuan worth of passenger tickets daily, while the West Railway Station sold around 20,000 yuan daily. Yesterday, ticket sales were 15,000 to 16,000 yuan. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the peace issue, progress has been made as a result of ongoing efforts up to the 25th. Since the afternoon of the 24th, Japanese front-line troops have begun to move further away from our troops. The two sides are only in a state of confrontation. With the war having stopped, the situation is gradually easing. According to a spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission, the peace movement, since mutual sympathy was expressed, has proceeded in two steps: first, the military issues, and second, the diplomatic issues. Because since our troops retreated from the front, the Japanese troops have been advancing step by step, making war difficult to avoid and peace impossible to begin. Therefore, to avoid war, the Japanese side must stop military action, and at the same time, the two armies must be kept at a distance to prevent conflict. Only then can peace be negotiated. Based on the situation at the front, the first step has not been fully accomplished, but it is largely not a problem. As for the second step, because it belongs to the diplomatic sphere, the central government has a set policy, and North China is related to the entire Sino-Japanese problem, which cannot be successfully completed overnight. Comparing it to the Shanghai Incident makes it clear that the Shanghai Incident was only a local problem. From the ceasefire to the resolution of the case, there were several twists and turns, lasting four or five months, before it was successful. Moreover, the situation in North China is complex, and a solution is naturally not easy. It is too early to talk about establishing an agreement and consultations reaching a certain level. However, in this serious situation, we should maintain a spirit of perseverance to deal with everything. At present, we dare not be optimistic, nor should we be pessimistic. (25th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese have not forgotten Beiping and Tianjin, but they will not take direct action. They plan to use plainclothes troops to harass the area at opportune moments. Our authorities are taking strict precautions. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhou Dawen said that the authorities have long been prepared for the security of Beiping, and there is nothing to worry about. The dangerous period in Beiping has passed, and all rumors are not credible. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) This afternoon, a spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission stated that a ceasefire is in effect, but the situation cannot be resolved in a short time. The establishment of peace requires two steps: military and diplomatic. Regarding the military aspect, it involves the cessation of hostile actions. This level has now been achieved. Regarding the diplomatic aspect, it is naturally a part of the general Sino-Japanese issue. Resolution will take time. The situation in the North cannot be compared to Shanghai after last year's war, because the events in the North are more important and more complex. The Shanghai Incident still required five months to be fully resolved, but the Chinese authorities will handle the events in the North with perseverance. (25th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Patrol the Eastern City Area</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Although the current situation here is difficult to handle, it is still peaceful. The Fourth Japanese Army is constantly patrolling the eastern city area and is surveying the strategic locations, buildings, and fortresses on the eastern and southern city walls, fearing that incidents may easily occur. According to news from the front, everything is quiet on the front lines. General He Yingqin's Military Affairs Commission was still denying the Sino-Japanese ceasefire arrangements late last night.

(25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Order in Tianjin Gradually Being Restored</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 25th, the battles on all fronts were quiet, and peace negotiations seemed to have made significant progress. Since noon on the 24th, the enemy has stopped attacking and has gradually retreated. Order in Tianjin is gradually being restored, and the city is back to normal. Nankai resumed classes on the 25th, but the municipal elementary schools have been temporarily postponed. More than 20,000 refugees gathered at the French military barracks in Dongjuzi are being rescued by local associations and charitable organizations, and 600 reed sheds have been built to provide shelter. At 9:00 a.m. on the 25th, leaders of various charitable organizations and military officials of the French Consulate General inspected the grounds and provided health assistance. Trains to the east of the Beining Railway are operating as usual, and postal services to the east of the Luohe River are still open. Refugees fleeing to Tianjin from Beiping have disappeared since the 25th. There are very few passengers on the northbound trains on the Jinpu Railway. There were only four first-class passengers, eight second-class passengers, and not many third-class passengers. The authorities are taking the usual precautions to prevent disturbances by petty thieves and are strictly searching for plainclothes troops. Li Wanfa was arrested in the Sanbuguan area on the evening of the 24th and taken to the bureau for interrogation. The provincial government has issued a special order to all counties to prevent traitors from poisoning the Jingnei area in nearby counties. (25th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese侨民 Valuables Concentrated for Preservation</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Last night, there were rumors in Beiping that the Japanese Embassy ordered the local Japanese僑民 to concentrate in the embassy district. According to an investigation, it was purely an order for the Japanese僑民 to concentrate and store their valuables, first handing them over to the Yamato Club and then storing them in the Zhengjin Bank. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japanese Aircraft Carrier Anchored Outside Dagu Port</h3>

<h3>Huang Fu and Others Preparing for the Beiping Political Reorganization Committee</h3>
<p>(Beiping) This morning at 10:00 a.m., Huang Fu invited He Yingqin, Jiang Bocheng, and Zhang Qun to Fengzeyuan to discuss various issues related to the current situation for a long time before dispersing at noon.

Wang Kemin still has glass fragments in his eyeball and needs further surgery. He has been attending meetings while battling illness in recent days. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The League of Nations Is Not Surprised by the Sino-Japanese Ceasefire News</h3>
<p>The General Assembly Passed the Report Exactly Three Months Ago, According to the Covenant, China Has the Right to Declare War on Japan</p>
<p>(Geneva) The news of the imminent ceasefire between China and Japan in North China has not caused surprise in Geneva. Because the Japanese army has a better organization and better machines, it is clearly visible that China's attempt to maintain military resistance against Japan will be laborious. The news of stopping the bloodshed is welcomed by the League of Nations. However, it is not yet known whether the ceasefire is subject to political conditions. People here believe that China can of course dispose of its land at will, but if China signs a ceasefire agreement on the one hand and does not give up its rights in the Northeast on the other hand, the attitude of the League of Nations will not be swayed by this kind of partial compromise. (24th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to Article 12 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, the members of the League of Nations agreed that if a dispute arose between the members of the League of Nations that was likely to lead to a rupture, the matter should be submitted to arbitration or legal judgment, or to the examination of the Administrative Council, and agreed that in any case, war should not be engaged in until three months after the arbitration decision, or legal judgment, or the report of the Administrative Council. The report of the Nineteen Committee on the Sino-Japanese dispute was passed by the Extraordinary General Assembly of the League of Nations on February 24 of this year, exactly three months ago. Therefore, in terms of jurisprudence, China has the right to declare war on Japan from today (May 24). It is reported that China has no intention of declaring war. (24th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Financial Difficulties in Beiping</h3>

(25th Special Dispatch)</p>

The main force of the Japanese army on my front is a combined force of infantry and cavalry of about 6,000 to 7,000 men, dozens of cannons, and more than ten tanks. Under the fierce artillery fire, they突進 towards me, and at the same time, they used six or seven planes to repeatedly bomb my positions. My officers and soldiers calmly responded to the battle, and the two sides were close to each other, only about one or two hundred meters apart.

<h3>The Situation in Beiping and Tianjin Is Trending Towards Conciliation Again</h3>
<p>With Several Twists and Turns, It Once Almost Led To a Rupture</p>
<p>Beiping Special Dispatch: Since the Japanese army went deep, our side has adhered to the principle of resisting on the one hand and negotiating on the other, preparing militarily on the one hand and taking non-compromise and non-seeking peace as the standard on the other. Under mutual understanding, seeking peace, the Japanese side's threat purpose is also not to directly invade and occupy Beiping and Tianjin, but to ensure the possession of the three northeastern provinces and Rehe Chahar, so although the two sides are at war, diplomatic contacts have not been interrupted. Before Huang Fu came to Ping, the two sides had a considerable understanding, the first step was to cease fire and withdraw troops first. After coming to Ping, they immediately consulted with He Yingqin and others to proceed according to this intention. The troops in front were moving one after another according to the predetermined line. Unexpectedly, the Japanese side had different opinions, especially the front-line generals, who were strong and arrogant, took advantage of my army's movement, pressing in with every step, attempting to force me into a pact under the city, in order to fulfill their great desires. Until the day before yesterday (21), it was said that my army was not automatically withdrawing, but was forced by the Japanese army, and that Song Ziwen was in the United States, negotiating with Roosevelt to制日. There was no sincerity in peace, and there was no need to talk about it anymore, resolutely refusing to proceed with any peace talks with me. Seeing that the Japanese side was so arrogant and cunning, my side convened a meeting in Jurentang the night before yesterday (21). In addition to He Huang, Song Zheyuan, Pang Bingxun, Shang Zhen, Fu Zuoyi, Wan Fulin, Xu Tingyao, Gao Guizi, Jiang Bocheng, Zhang Qun, etc., all attended. He Huang fully reported the course of the negotiations and the current situation of the two sides'决絶. The generals were unusually angry, and after deep consultations late into the night, they dispersed until 2:00 a.m. yesterday morning, all advocating that today, the only option is to fight a decisive battle in the vicinity of the perimeter of Beiping and Tianjin, fighting with our backs to the city, sparing no sacrifice. Shang, Song, Pang, Chuan, Wan, etc. were sent to take charge of the defense of various roads, and Xu Tingyao was appointed as the commander of the Beiping city defense, responsible for defending the city. Yesterday morning (22), He convened a meeting with the presidents of various universities to explain the situation of the decisive battle in Beiping. He asked them to take responsibility for the aftercare of the schools. At the same time, he notified the ministers of various countries that the Japanese army was invading Beiping and Tianjin, and I decided to fight with our backs to the city. If the侨民 of various countries are affected, all responsibilities will be borne by the Japanese side, and the safety of the侨民 should also be properly handled by the ministers of various countries in advance. After my side decided to fight in the suburbs of the city, it made various wartime preparations. The air inside and outside the city suddenly became unusually tense. The Military Affairs Commission also moved important documents. Huang Fu convened various political committees at 4:00 p.m. to discuss everything. It was in this extremely tense atmosphere that the Japanese side saw that I was determined to fight to the death and suddenly softened. The Japanese military department and the Kwantung Army both sent telegrams to the Japanese Embassy, ordering them to continue to seek peaceful means as the opportunity arose. The Japanese chargé d'affaires Zhongshan then visited He Yingqin at 4:00 p.m. yesterday (22nd), expressing that there was still a possibility for continued consultation and a willingness to continue seeking peaceful solutions. At the same time, British Minister Lambson also returned to the city from the Western Hills to mediate. Last night at 10:00 p.m., He Huang, the British and French ministers, and Japanese chargé d'affaires Zhongshan, etc., thoroughly discussed the preliminary peace agreement at Jurentang all night. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 a.m. this morning (23). It is said that the method is that the Chinese army will withdraw to the area south of Changping, Shunyi, Gaoliying, Tongzhou, Xianghe, Baodi, and Ninghe. The Japanese army will no longer advance. China will send personnel to Miyun, and the Japanese army will also send personnel to my army to discuss ceasefire methods, and discuss all the detailed methods for implementing the ceasefire and withdrawal of troops in Tianjin. It will be agreed upon in a few days. The situation today (23) suddenly turned harmonious. At 11:00 a.m., Tang Erhe was summoned to Jurentang to discuss something. The counselors of the British and French embassies also visited He to discuss something. However, only the ceasefire is currently being discussed. All issues have not yet been discussed. The Japanese side is full of tricks. It is still difficult to predict whether there will be any changes in the future. Since the Japanese army approached Beiping, they continued to attack me yesterday afternoon. The enemy in the Yanjiao Town area crossed the canal at 5:00 p.m. and used armored vehicles to rush to a place more than ten miles away from Tongzhou, firing cannons at Tongzhou City. At the same time, enemy troops were also discovered in the defense areas of Pang Bingxun, Shang Guizi, and others. There was no fighting on the front after 10:00 p.m. yesterday. At about 7:00 this morning, six Japanese planes flew to the sky over Beiping again, circling and reconnaissance for about an hour before flying away. It is still unknown why the Japanese planes came again. (23rd Da)</p>
<h3>Charity King Yadeli Duo Donates 10 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Distributing to Refugees in Jiangxi</p>
<p>(Nanchang) A reporter from the Central News Agency received a letter from Yu Guangjun, the general director of the Nanchang Jesus Church, on the 25th, saying that I received a telegram from a friend in New York at 5:00 a.m. on the 23rd, saying that the American charity king Yadeli Duo, who is currently the president of the World Jesus Church, heard that Song Ziwen, the chief representative of my country attending the London Economic Conference, promoted in the United States that my country has been suffering from internal and external troubles, frequent natural disasters, and the people are extremely distressed, especially in Jiangxi. The charity king was moved in his heart and a kind thought arose. He has now decided to send his chief disciple, Weidun, with 10 million yuan, which must be transferred from the Bank of New York to the Bank of China within seven days, to distribute to refugees in Jiangxi. It is reported that he estimates 200,000 refugees, with 50 yuan given to each adult and 20 yuan given to each child. If there are fewer than 200,000 refugees, the amount will be increased accordingly and not used for other purposes. (25th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Fook Company Shooting of Workers Tragedy</h3>
<p>Petition from All Circles in Jiaozuo</p>
<p>(Zhengzhou) Representatives from all circles in Jiaozuo, due to the Fook Company's oppression of workers and the shooting deaths of several workers, have formed the "May 13th Tragedy Relief Association." They dispatched representatives Li Xunzi, Niu Baode, and Yu to Zhengzhou on the 25th to petition the provincial government. Li stated that the Fook Company is currently using various means, including buying off various parties with money, to attempt to resume work. However, we will not be utilized by them and have proposed ten demands: (1) The British government must apologize to the Chinese government. (2) The Fook Company must apologize to all workers. (3) Please have the government severely punish the chief culprits, Cai Kesi and Zhang Zhigang. (4) Provide generous compensation and support for the deceased workers and their families. (5) Pay wages for the strike period. (6) Ensure that no further killings or oppression of workers occur. (7) Implement a three-shift, eight-hour system. (8) Abolish the contract labor system. (9) Workers who become ill due to labor should receive medical treatment from the company, and wages should be paid during the illness period. Workers who are disabled on the job should receive lifetime support from the company. (10) In the future, if workers make reasonable demands, the company must not refuse and should accept them. Petitioning the government, if the Fook Company does not adopt these measures, the case will not only escalate, but we request the government to halt the company's operations and take it over.

<h3>Liu Zhenhua Flew to Beijing from Nanchang Yesterday</h3>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Roosevelt and Ishii Kikujiro: Understanding</h3>
<p>Since the United States experienced this financial panic, it has realized that the prosperity of the United States alone is unreliable. Although the Pan-American Economic Union is geographically separated by two oceans, it enjoys a natural advantage. In terms of human affairs, the Monroe Doctrine has been followed to this day, and all North and South American countries listen to the leadership of the United States. It should be able to maintain prosperity for all ages and protect its throne as the financial king. However, besides North and South America, Canada is aligned with the British Empire. Although there is a tendency towards separation, it is still an integral part. Europe has formed another system under the leadership of France, followed by the union of fascist Germany and Italy. Japan in the East is vigorously advocating its so-called "Japan-Manchuria Economic Union," attempting to close the door of the Far East. The Soviet Union, spanning Eurasia, has formed its own economic system and is confronting the entire capitalist system. Thus, the United States of America is facing enemies on all sides and is almost unable to extricate itself. The initial talks between British Prime Minister MacDonald and US President Roosevelt hinted that the United States and China had abandoned their traditional habits and were attempting international cooperation. The Washington Fireside Chat was originally a preparatory meeting for the London World Economic Conference on June 12th. Apart from the exchange of economic opinions, it seemed to have no other purpose. If the world economy can truly find a definite and appropriate solution, political disputes will be easily resolved, and the arrival of a good economic market is just around the corner.</p>
<p>However, by the middle of this month, the political crisis in Europe suddenly became more apparent. The disarmament movement was on the verge of paralysis. The conflict between France and Germany almost triggered political disputes among European countries. Issues such as the arms race, the redivision of territories, and the redistribution of colonies were all sufficient to ignite wars and stir up turmoil. In the Far East, we have spent every day in the terror of war for the past year and eight months. Today, the military has even advanced to the Tianjin East area, and militarists are arbitrarily trampling on us. This situation has caused us great losses, and the world economy has also suffered a great blow. The market has shrunk, consumption has declined, and the economic panic still does not know where it will end. Therefore, on the 16th of this month, the US President issued a peace declaration proposing the implementation of disarmament. In Europe, it is a timely solution that meets the current needs. In the Far East, it is also in line with the imminent crisis that urgently needs to be resolved.</p>
<p>Judging from the superficial situation between Japan and the United States, in terms of economy, the United States is a heavy industry country, and Japan is a light industry country. There is no direct conflict in trade. Overseas investments have their own scope, and war debts and reparations are not related to each other. Therefore, the United States and Japan are complementary to each other, and there are many conditions for economic cooperation. This is the reason why the "Ishii-Lansing Agreement" was established. However, why are both Japan and the United States the main players in the struggle for supremacy in the Pacific? The reason is that Japan's monopoly of East Asia not only destroys international equilibrium but also cuts off the United States' opportunities to develop overseas markets. It can also extend its reach to South America while encompassing "Manchuria" and invading North China. The United States is certainly greatly affected, but the ocean is far away, and its power cannot reach. The violence of the Japanese army cannot be stopped by empty words. This is why it is hesitant and cannot do anything.</p>
<p>However, economically, Japan is caught between the gold yen and the gold pound. If the British and American currencies tend to stabilize, the yen will inevitably seek a new parity, and the export of Japanese goods will be at a disadvantage. Otherwise, it will be very difficult for Japan to cope with retaliation from Britain and the United States. If the disarmament issue is understood and established by the United States and France, Japan will inevitably be forced to participate. If Japan stubbornly refuses, it will inevitably be subjected to international pressure. If it participates, North China and the three northeastern provinces will be bound by international treaties, and militarism will inevitably become unstable both internally and externally, with many other forces restricting it. As for the market issue, it also occupies a special and important position in the World Economic Conference. If Japan participates in the international market agreement, first, it will be difficult to monopolize "Manchuria," and second, the path of Japan's rising industries will be locked by the huge economic power of the advanced countries. If it closes its doors to the world, it will inevitably face the threat of "boycotts" and feel the danger of isolation. Although President Roosevelt's talks with Representative Ishii have not officially begun, one can deduce its many contradictions from Ishii's public statement and Japan's foreign policy over the past year. However, on the surface, it is appeasing the United States with peace. As for the relief of the economic panic, it is feared that it will ultimately resort to military threats and will not be able to achieve a good result.</p>

<h3>Delegates from Various Countries Agree on Disarmament Convention Negotiation Clauses</h3>
<p>Little Entente Requests Modification of Wording, Can Be Passed Within Next Week</p>
<p>(Geneva) After British Foreign Secretary Simon presented a new draft of the negotiated clauses to the Disarmament General Committee today, representatives from France, Germany, Italy, Poland, and Soviet Russia all praised the British move, guaranteeing that the new draft could be passed next week. If this draft is passed on second reading, it will be listed as the first three clauses of the Disarmament Convention. As for the Little Entente's attitude, although they generally agree, they believe that the wording should be slightly changed so that the obligation to negotiate arises when there is an actual violation of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, rather than when there is a possible threat of violation. It is difficult to determine when there is a threat of violating the treaty. Other representatives argued that the wording of the clauses could be modified to satisfy the Little Entente, but its strength should not be reduced in any way. It is expected that the two sides will reach an agreement on these opinions at the beginning of the week. As for the clauses on reducing armaments, they are currently being privately contacted by various representatives. (National News Agency dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) This afternoon, the Disarmament Conference General Committee has achieved good work. The tense atmosphere created yesterday by Peng Ge's speech against the destruction of offensive armaments has now been dispelled. The first five clauses of the Disarmament Convention proposed by Britain have been redrafted by Britain, and all are satisfied with and accept them. US Representative Davis issued a warning speech and further clarified the US attitude, so the atmosphere of accepting the new British draft is becoming more intense. British Foreign Secretary Simon thanked Davis for his prompt response and said that the Polish delegation had benefited greatly from the preparation of this new draft by submitting amendments to the original draft. The General Committee adjourned at 6:30 tonight and will reconvene tomorrow morning. The discussion on security issues will continue this afternoon. British Foreign Secretary Simon is scheduled to fly back to London tomorrow morning to participate in the debate on foreign affairs in the House of Commons. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<h3>Definition of "Aggressor"</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Security Committee, organized by the Disarmament Conference to study Article 1 of the British Disarmament Convention draft, has now stipulated the definition of the term "aggressor." It is reported that the committee considers the following five items as acts of aggression: (1) Declaration of war; (2) Aggression by armed forces without a declaration of war; (3) Attacks by naval, land, or air forces against a country or its ships or aircraft; (4) Establishment of a naval blockade of a country's coast or port; (5) Assistance to armed groups that have invaded the territory of another country. The above definition is based on the proposals made by Soviet Russia, which is noteworthy. The committee also submitted two appendices: one stipulates the reasons why aggression can be considered legal, and the other stipulates the organization of a five-member committee to determine the facts regarding the alleged acts of aggression.

<h3>Disarmament Conference Begins Discussion on Naval Issues</h3>
<p>(Geneva) This morning, the Disarmament Conference General Committee discussed the clauses on naval armaments in the British plan. French Representative Massigli declared that this was the first time the General Committee had discussed naval issues. The existing naval treaties are all habitual works, and the plan proposed by the British delegation this time does not involve the general agreement that should be formulated before 1935 as stipulated in the London Naval Treaty. Therefore, there are currently three types of naval systems: one is the three countries that signed the London Agreement, namely Britain, the United States, and Japan, one is the two countries that signed the Washington Agreement other than the three countries of Britain, the United States, and Japan, namely France and Italy, and the other is the remaining countries. Therefore, before the British plan holds a second reading, the complex naval system should first be simplified and some principles should be found in it, such as the principle of quantitative limitation. The Naval Committee has advocated reducing the tonnage of battleships to 25,000 tons and reducing the caliber of cannons. France has already accepted reducing the tonnage of each cruiser from 10,000 tons to 8,000 tons, and the cannons installed on them shall not exceed 155 meters. US Representative Davis said that the signing of the Washington and London Agreements by the United States and Britain was the initial model for disarmament. Davis also expressed regret for Japan's opposition to the current agreement. This debate will continue tomorrow, and the General Committee will continue to discuss security issues at 3:30 pm.

<h3>Japan Suggests Abolishing Washington and London Naval Agreements</h3>

<h3>Little Entente and the Four Powers</h3>
<p>(Geneva) It is expected here that the three Central European countries (Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia) may now follow Japan's possible withdrawal from the League of Nations. Tonight, it was heard that Czech Foreign Minister Dr. Benes told British Foreign Secretary Simon that if the Four-Power Pact is signed, the Little Entente will withdraw from the League of Nations. In the past few days, private discussions and hype about the Four-Power Pact have had a strong influence on the discussions of the Left Disarmament Conference. French Foreign Minister Boncour discussed this matter with British Foreign Secretary Simon for a long time tonight. According to French sources, Britain opposes mentioning Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, which stipulates sanctions, in the Four-Power Pact, while France strongly advocates mentioning this article, so that this pact can be accepted by Poland and the Little Entente. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to reports from some of the highest authorities, the statement that the Little Entente will withdraw from the League of Nations if the Four-Power Pact is signed is completely unfounded.

<h3>US Warships Temporarily Maintain Status Quo to Avoid Reducing Naval Effectiveness, Rotating Leisure Order Rescinded</h3>
<p>(Washington) After a detailed investigation by the US Navy Department, it was found that the plan to rotate each warship for six months of leisure did not save much on the Navy's regular expenses, so Navy Secretary Swanson rescinded the previous order today. After the order was announced a few days ago that each warship would rotate one-third of its leisure time from July 1, naval officers and experts protested, saying that the savings were minimal, while the effectiveness would be greatly reduced. After a detailed study by the Navy Department, it was also found that this move would only save 5.5 million yuan per year, except for reducing the salaries of officials. It is believed that this small amount can be saved elsewhere. However, the method of alternating rest for submarines and destroyers has been in place for some time and will remain unchanged. The necessary repairs for each warship will be carried out when they need to be repaired. Shi now feels that if the rotation system is implemented, the result will be that the Navy will lose its balance, so he has withdrawn the previous order.

According to Secretary of State Hull, political issues were not discussed, or it is not known whether they will be discussed.

<h3>Japanese Government Instructs Matsudaira to Accept British Proposal</h3>
<p>Trade Negotiations to Be Held in London, But with Three Conditions Attached</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Last night, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs telegraphed Japanese Ambassador to Britain Matsudaira, instructing him to accept the British proposal to convene a British-Japanese trade conference, but with the following conditions attached: (1) The resolution is limited to the cotton industry issue. (2) The British government should assist in the implementation of the resolution. (3) The British government should guarantee that its colonies will not cancel Japan's commercial agreements or raise tariffs to boycott Japanese goods. This move is the result of discussions between representatives of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Commerce and industry and business people. The opinion of the local business community is that the success of the British-Japanese trade negotiations depends entirely on the British attitude towards the conditions put forward by Japan. After Japan receives the British reply, local business people will select the representatives to attend. If the British reply indicates disapproval, the representatives to attend will be appointed by Japanese residing in Britain and will no longer be dispatched from the country.

However, Polish local officials claim that Poland cannot allow an unlimited number of Russian refugees to enter due to political, health, and economic reasons. Therefore, the Polish Ministry of the Interior must deal with this matter as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>US Senate Thoroughly Investigates Morgan Silver Company Case</h3>
<p>Involving Current Treasury Secretary Wooden, a Political Storm May Be Triggered</p>
<p>Reuters, 24th, Washington Dispatch: Today, when Morgan continued to be questioned about his company's affairs, it was discovered that the current Treasury Secretary Wooden was listed at one time in the list of bank employees and directors serving Morgan Company. This matter is now being investigated by the Senate Committee. A political storm is brewing. Former Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Bora claimed in a speech somewhere tonight that the American people, in this critical era when the Treasury Secretary wields great power, should hope that the Treasury Secretary, like Caesar's wife, is above all suspicion. It is believed that Bora meant that Wooden should resign to dispel public doubts. There are a total of sixty people listed on this list, including the American representative to the disarmament conference Davis, the author of the famous Dawes Plan General Dawes, and the former president of the New York City Bank Lia Qianer. It is reported that the six million yuan borrowed by Mr. Mi has not yet been repaid. The debts of Dawes and Dai Le, the president of the New York Steel Company, have been cleared. Morgan also mentioned that Wooden and Mcadoo, the Treasury Secretary in the Wilson Cabinet, were among those who could purchase securities from his company according to special agreements.</p>
<p>National, 24th, Washington Dispatch: Today, when the Senate Investigating Banking Committee investigated the contents of the Morgan Silver Company, it discovered that several political and financial leaders had purchased stocks at a price far lower than the market price in 1929 and immediately sold them to the public, making huge profits. Two of them are currently in important government positions. The committee lawyer Picola announced this list today. It is said that a friend of the Morgan Company purchased shares of Allegheny Corporation for $20 per share and immediately sold them on the New York Stock Exchange at a market price of over $31. Those who made this stock transaction at that time included the current Secretary of the Treasury Wooden, General Pershing, aviator Lindbergh, former Secretary of the Navy Adams, former Chairman of the Democratic National Committee Reiske, Senator Mcadoo, 1924 presidential candidate Davis, and Stirling Young, Pike, etc. It is said that the company keeps a list of those who can make such securities transactions with the company. Those not on the list are not entitled to this right. According to reports, many people purchased securities in the securities market in 1929, which later became waste paper. There are not a few in the audience today. Morgan himself also admitted today that his company had spent millions of dollars in the securities market to maintain several well-known securities to prevent them from plummeting. Morgan was willing to answer most of the committee's questions and only objected to publishing the list of friends who had borrowed personal credit from Morgan Bank. However, the committee was not willing to object to it and published this list, such as the aforementioned Davis, and Davis, who is currently serving as the ambassador to Europe, former Vice President Dawes, General Manager of United States Steel Corporation Dai Le, and President of the New York Stock Exchange Weiner, all of whom are on the list. It is said that about one-third of this loan has not yet been repaid. It was also discovered that the company's commercial banking business is larger than its investment banking business. Furthermore, the company's partners paid a total of 11 million yuan in income tax in 1929, but have not paid a cent in the past two years.</p>
<h3>Cracks in the Japanese Seiyukai</h3>
<p>Kuhara and Tokonami Factions Advocate Supporting the Current Cabinet Suzuki Faction Advocates Severing Ties with the Government</p>
<p>China United Press, 25th, Tokyo Dispatch: The Japanese Seiyukai held another executive meeting today to discuss the attitude to be taken towards the government. It is heard that the general trend within the party has leaned towards severing ties with the government. However, the timing and method are left to President Suzuki. It is expected that the timing will be the budget formation meeting in mid-August, choosing the issue of agricultural relief funds to conflict with the government. Before August, cabinet members from the Seiyukai will remain in the current cabinet.</p>
<p>China United Press, 25th, Tokyo Dispatch: After Finance Minister Takahashi remained in office, he proposed to President Suzuki, requesting that Suzuki join the cabinet as a Minister Without Portfolio to support the current cabinet. Suzuki immediately refused and convened a party affairs meeting. The meeting yesterday resulted in many discussions and no conclusion. The arguments are divided into two types. The Suzuki faction advocates taking the opportunity to withdraw the three ministers from the party and sever ties with the government. If the government dissolves the Diet, it will be forced to do so. There is no way out without a war. This faction advocates war. Because the Mitsui boss is behind the scenes, the election fees are secured, so it can advocate war. The Kuhara faction and the Tokonami faction oppose Suzuki's rise to power, arguing that the emergency has not yet disappeared and that the people must wholeheartedly support the current government to achieve their goals. In fact, they want to collude with the warlords and find another way out. Because they do not have a large financial group behind them as their boss, they are very afraid of dissolving the Diet. Therefore, if the Seiyukai decides to fight the government, it will be difficult to avoid division. If the Seiyukai splits, </p>
<p>The political parties in Japan will also change accordingly. Suzuki's decision is very noteworthy.</p>
<h3>Japan Discovers International Secret Society</h3>
<p>Lighthouse Society Promotes Anarchism Headquarters in New York Society Sixty Police Departments Contacting Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Investigation</p>
<p>Tokyo News: Recently, Japan discovered an international secret society called the "Lighthouse Society." This society uses the promotion of religion as a guise, but in fact promotes anarchism and attempts to undermine the national system. The headquarters is located in New York, and there are more than sixty branches, scattered in various countries around the world. Recently, it was banned and exiled by the authorities in Germany and suppressed in the United States. The movement of this society is completely secret in nature, like the worldwide Jewish alliance and the Ku Klux Klan. The Japanese police department has recently worked hard to investigate and successively captured dozens of members in Choshi, Kamakura, Hikone, and Hiroshima City. It has contacted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to conduct a nationwide investigation. (World News)</p>

<h3>Returning from the Front Line</h3>
<p>Our Special Correspondent Geng Ya (3) War News Miscellany</p>
<p>The Japanese army surrounds Tianjin, threatening North China. Shandong Province is adjacent to Yan and Hebei, and borders the coast. Its importance in today's tense situation in North China can be known. Therefore, I took the opportunity to visit Chairman Han and inquire about the situation. According to him, Chairman Huang recently passed by Jinan and met with him, and I learned that there were ways to deal with the North China situation. Shandong is one of the five provinces in North China. As a member of the Political Committee, I will do my best according to the entire plan of the Central Government. My administration of Shandong is based on the principle of seeking truth from facts. Regarding cases of bandits, drugs, and public officials, as long as the limits of judicial power are not violated, I personally investigate and interrogate them strictly, never hesitating to bother. The purpose is to prevent cunning officials from using their tricks and to allow poor people to extend their grievances. I only seek peace of mind in everything. If there are any oversights, I hope to be forgiven by the local people. Returning to the hotel, I suddenly saw luggage blocking the door and the room was full of guests. Every room was full. They were all people who had just escaped from Dagu. Because the traitorous disaster that had been brewing for a long time in Tianjin broke out in the middle of the night on the 19th. It is said that many of these traitors are frustrated warlords of the Beiyang faction, instigated by the puppet organization of Manchuria and secretly supplied with weapons by the Japanese. However, on the surface, they still call for the Five-Color National Flag, calling themselves something like the "Chinese National Self-Defense Army" and the "North China National Autonomous Allied Army" and other nonsensical names. Fortunately, the military police, who had been prepared for a long time and waited in strict formation, launched a vigorous attack. The street fighting did not last for five or six hours before they scattered like birds and beasts. Recently, the authorities in Pingjin have strictly ordered that anyone caught throwing bombs, no matter who they are or what their intention is, will be executed. Therefore, the situation of throwing explosives in the city has gradually disappeared. In the western commercial port of Jinan City, Japanese expatriates live in mixed communities and foreign firms stand in rows. The pawnshop industry has been monopolized by Japanese merchants. All industries do not pay the business tax and stamp tax due to our government. The sound of "clogs" can be heard everywhere. When interacting with our merchants or entering and leaving public places, there are those who wear long robes and short jackets and disguise themselves as Chinese. Although this is the site of the May 3rd Massacre, the state of harmony between Japanese expatriates and our residents seems to have no boundary. Later, taking a car again, the passengers gradually felt looser. Looking at the northbound car through the window, the passengers were even rarer than the morning stars. The farmers weeding in the lush wheat fields are mostly those with braided hair. The Shandong Provincial Government once vigorously implemented haircutting two months ago, but it is difficult to eradicate the roots. It is not easy to reform the government in this way. Suddenly, there was a burst of noise. Upon inquiry, it turned out that the ticket inspector was arguing with a young man who could not afford the full fare. It is said that the young man had worked on the front line in the east. Because he did not know how fast the army retreated, he was left behind to walk alone and was robbed by the defeated soldiers. Later, Yang Qishan and Liang Juwu of the Military Commission learned about the matter and issued a military vehicle ticket, ordering the young man to pay half the fare to end the matter. The reporter spoke to him and learned that they had also returned from the front. Mr. Liang inspected the Zhangyuan and Chicheng areas alone. Therefore, I asked about Feng Yuxiang's preparations for resisting Japan. He replied that Feng did have this preparation. His guards had dispatched a group to Zhangbei to construct defensive fortifications. He also said, "I am determined to leave this false and prosperous city and return to Yunnan and Guizhou to expose the crimes of the Japanese in North China who brutally murdered our compatriots and awaken the Yunnan and Guizhou troops to stop the internal strife and prepare to resist aggression. I have been in the army for more than ten years, and there are many comrades in Yunnan and Guizhou. I am confident that this trip will achieve considerable results." Later, Mr. Huang Kangyong was introduced. Huang worked in the army of Wang Yizhe and the divisions of Weng and Zhang. It is heard that the senior officers of the army are very strict in governing the army. Those who retreat without reason during wartime will be shot by the supervisory team. During peacetime, military officers patrol in plain clothes to strictly prevent soldiers from disturbing the people. When Qian'an fell, the defense of the city was led by the first battalion commander of the Zhang Division. He only led dozens of his remaining men back. Wang, without issuing a retreat order, ordered the battalion commander to be beheaded as a warning. After the division commanders tried their best to bail him out, the battalion commander also begged to preserve his head and was willing to immediately lead the remaining troops to counterattack and die on the battlefield. However, Wang only remembered his previous achievements and did not behead him, but shot him instead. He Lizhong's division guarded the Mengguan Camp area. The Japanese army crossed the river three times, but failed to capture it. The captured Japanese prisoners begged and said, "Jin Yuan has a lot, please don't cut off our heads." The Japanese army's trench positions were raised to look like tombs. Our army often did not pay attention when attacking past them at night. Such is their cunning. The Japanese army attacked the bustling towns of Guantoushan, Dawuli, and Yangdianzi. They did not capture them quickly, so they threw incendiary bombs for two days. The fire was sky-high and did not extinguish for several days and nights, burning countless people and animals to death. It was also tragic. He Bin, the battalion commander of the Second Battalion of the 146th Regiment of the Central 25th Division, returned to Beijing for treatment after being seriously injured. He was also present and told the story of the battle, saying, "On the 13th, more than ten enemy planes and dozens of armored vehicles attacked Shixia City, breaking through the southeast corner. Company Commander Shao Zeyuan and dozens of soldiers all died heroically. Only one gun mount was recovered from two machine guns. At the same time, Highland 26 in the northwest of the city was also captured. If it was not recovered, there would be no way to counterattack Shicheng. Therefore, I led more than 30 people to bravely recapture it, with only a dozen of us left after the deaths and injuries. I was also injured in three places by light machine guns and fainted to the ground. Fortunately, the enemy armored vehicles could not go up, and we were able to hold on. However, several counterattacks on Shicheng failed. In this battle, in addition to my injury, a company commander and four platoon leaders were killed, and three platoon leaders were injured. The total number of soldiers killed and injured was around 400. There were no more than 30 people in the entire battalion who still had combat effectiveness. When reinforcements arrived, the injured were transported to the rear. From then on, the danger was completely lost. The enemy was able to drive straight in, and the situation should become more and more critical. I sincerely hope that this injury will heal soon so that I can continue to kill the enemy with my immortal body." When the car arrived in Bengbu, I saw hundreds of refugees with difficult complexions. I didn't know where they came from. In the drizzling rain, they squatted together in roofless iron cars and were dragged sadly to the north. When crossing the Yangtze River to the south, I thought that the rumbling of cannons in Yan and Hebei could no longer be heard from afar, so the various appearances on the Beijing-Shanghai train were filled with a new scene of "enjoying pleasure and forgetting one's homeland." I was among them, looking north at the billowing war clouds, admiring the deep wounds, and worried that a great disaster would be following us south. Suddenly, the whistle blew, and the car had arrived at the North Station. (The End)</p>
<h3>Ma Zhanshan's Journey Through Russia</h3>
<p>Li Du, Su Bingwen, Wang Delin, and Others Travel Together, the Car Stops for Four Hours to Meet Yan Shi, and then Go to Germany</p>
<p>Ma and Others Are Generous and Excited and Still Willing to Die for the Country</p>
<p>Moscow Communication, Ma Zhanshan was the first person to resist with strength. His troops fought in northern Manchuria, large and small, dozens of times. The Battle of Nenjiang was especially known to the world for its bravery. However, although the military's heart was firm, the equipment was insufficient. As transportation gradually decreased, </p>
<p>Because the Japanese army blocked and ambushed, Ma also accumulated overwork and became ill and had to go to Hailar to recuperate.</p>
<h3>Follow Su's Troops into Russia</h3>
<p>On December 5th of last year, Su Bingwen's troops were surrounded by the Japanese army on all sides. 2,890 soldiers, including 11 generals and 322 officers, and 1,200 civilians, including 347 women and 306 children, fled into Russian territory from Station 18 in Manzhouli. Ma was also among them, but because he signed his name with a pseudonym, it was not known to the outside world until December 23rd. The Japanese army wanted to obtain Ma's head because Ma was the most powerful opponent of the puppet organization and had repeatedly spread the news of his death. The Soviet government strictly abided by international debt practices. The soldiers were disarmed and settled in Tomsk along with the civilians. The Japanese army strongly demanded extradition, but the Soviet government refused. Fortunately, on December 12th, China and Russia announced the resumption of diplomatic relations in Geneva, and the Japanese army was even more unable to succeed. However, since the number of people was large, the cost of supplies was quite large, requiring at least one gold virtual cloth per person per day. Therefore, Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union Galahan submitted a memorandum to Wang Zensi, a special commissioner of the Sino-Soviet Conference, on February 20th, requesting money from the Chinese government.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Remittance for Relief</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance remitted 200,000 national currency units on January 8th of this year. However, on November 11th, the troops under Li Du and Wang Delin retreated into Russian territory at various locations, including the boundary marker between Tongjiang and Fuyuan, Tuanshanzi in Raohe, Yima in Hulin, Errenban and Qupaozi in Mishan, and the Dragon King Temple.</p>
<p>The tally included 5,925 military personnel, including 15 generals and 1,343 officers, as well as 548 civilians, including 163 cart drivers. The Soviet government continued to follow its previous practice of settling them in Tomsk. The total number reached 10,858 people. As a result, the cost of supplies increased significantly, and the Soviet government urgently requested funds. The Ministry of Finance then remitted another 100,000 national currency units. However, the large number of people made it difficult to provide adequate care. The two sides then agreed on a method of repatriation.</p>
<h3>Repatriation of Soldiers and Civilians</h3>
<p>Military personnel would be sent back via Xinjiang to avoid attracting the attention of the Japanese Navy en route. Civilians would be sent via Vladivostok and returned home by chartered ships. The civilian part was straightforward. For the military part, the Russian Consul in Dihua (Ürümqi) assisted in the negotiations. Subsequently, Jin Shuren, Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial Government, agreed to repatriate 1,000 people to Weitangzi (葦塘子) each week. The province sent personnel to Tacheng (塔城) to provide accommodation. The Central Government also sent Geng Kuang, stationed in Chita (赤塔), to Tomsk to assist in providing care. Starting from February 15th, the troops under Su Bingwen (蘇炳文) departed from Tomsk; the troops under Wang Delin departed from Shuangchengpu (雙城堡) on February 20th and the troops of Wang and Li departed from Bo Li (伯力) on February 15th. The troops under Li Du departed from Achinsk (阿城斯克) on March 3rd. The troops under Li Du departed from Krasnoyarsk (克拉斯諾牙斯克) on March 15th and 19th respectively, traveling by train. By March 23rd, the majority of the repatriation was completed. Simultaneously, civilians traveled by train to Vladivostok on February 17th and boarded the "Wuyang (無恙)" ship, a chartered vessel sent by the Central Government, for their return home. After repeated negotiations, the Soviet government agreed to reduce the repatriation cost to 600,000 US dollars. Furthermore, starting from February 10th, the daily cost of supplying the troops was still 6,400 gold rubles. The total amount is still pending an invoice from the Soviet side.</p>
<h3>Generals Taking the European Route</h3>
<p>For the convenience and safety of the generals, they would take the European route. The Central Government agreed to a limit of five or six people, and those who could afford their own travel expenses were allowed to do so. After Yan Huiqing took office as ambassador, he contacted the Soviet government to arrange transportation, prepare to travel through Poland and Germany, arrange passports and tickets, and secure ships for their return home. He worked tirelessly day and night, sending numerous telegrams. The special train departed from Tomsk at 10:00 AM on April 14th. The initial group consisted of 62 people, later joined by four people who returned from Vladivostok, bringing the total to 66. The names are as follows: Ma Zhanshan, Han Liru, Liu Guibin, Zhao Guian, Ning Lie, Liu Mengfu, Jin Yaodou, Du Haishan, Zhang Fengqi, Li Yuchen, Li Peijun, Wan Jinyin, Tong Yue, Li Du, Su Bingwen (Su's wife, Miss Su, two wet nurses, and a maid accompanying), Zhang Dianjiu, Wang Delin, Kong Xianrong, Gao Junling, Xie Ke (Mr. Xie accompanying), Zhang Peifu, Jin Kuifeng, Peng Zhonglin, Wang Lantian, Dong Shuhong, Xu Qinglin, Wu Hesheng, Lang Guochen, Liu Boying, Gai Xingya, Zhang Shenfu, Zhao Jingkun, Wan Yaoxian, Chen Youxin, Chen Tao, He Shengda, Wang Picheng, Yu Zhenqing, Shi Luchen, Liu Shaofu (Liu's wife accompanying), Chen Hongyou, Sun Lin, Jiang Ying, Yin Shengri, Liu Xubo, Liu Ming, Yuan Shi'an, Liu Guanren, Li Zhishan, Bao Fanggui, Wang Erzhan, Wu Delin, Yan Yongsheng, Xu Dianwu, Chen Zhanyuan. Those who joined temporarily: Zhang Zejun (his son Jingguo accompanying), Ji Honghai, Wu Zhenhua.</p>
<h3>Conversations Between Ma and Li</h3>
<p>In the drizzling rain, the special train passed through Moscow at 10:50 AM on the 18th. The train consisted of three sleeping cars, a dining car, and another car for the escort personnel. The station was heavily guarded, and even railway workers were not allowed to approach. Therefore, apart from embassy staff, only the reporter and Chen Youren's son, Pi Shi, were able to board the train for an interview. Ambassador Yan, on behalf of the government, expressed his condolences and had a pleasant conversation. Ma Zhanshan spoke the most, his passionate spirit evident in his expressions. He said that when the puppet state was being organized, he risked his life to go to Shenyang to persuade Puyi, who was moved to tears. However, Xi Qia and others were deceived by the Japanese rhetoric of co-existence and co-prosperity, leading to a grave mistake. In military terms, Zhang Haipeng used his old feud with Zhang Xueliang to seek personal revenge, remaining unrepentant until his death. Based on his personal military experience, the Japanese army lacked discipline and morale, a stark contrast to the Meiji era. At times, they even filled the ranks with Koreans, people from Jinzhou and Fuzhou, and so-called local soldiers, making them vulnerable. Their strength lay in their new weaponry and constant supply of resources. They fought in various places and when bullets ran out, they used earth cannons. Eventually, they ran out of ammunition and supplies, even digging wood and filling it with gunpowder as a substitute for cannons. The soldiers' resolve was firm, and none of them retreated without weeping. If the country is still willing to use him, he is willing to sacrifice himself. Su Bingwen and Li Du also fought the hardest this time. When Li spoke to the reporter, tears streamed down his face. He said that the Japanese army lacked fighting spirit, just as Chairman Ma had said. Therefore, apart from sufficient supplies and ammunition, their strategy was only to cut off communications. The supplies they received were only slightly over 100,000. However, they built more than 500 li of roads for automobiles and more than 1,000 li of telephone lines. Although the soldiers did not want pay, they still needed cotton clothing. When they were surrounded on all sides, they hastily fled with the people, and he did not even have time to take care of his six-year-old son. Currently, in Heilongjiang Province, Su Bingwen's troops have 20,000 men under Cai Hongyou, 10,000 each under Pu Datong and Nan Tingfang, 5,000 under Li Tiande, 3,000 under Xu Qingshan, and 2,000 each under Li Tianbao and Li Yunjie. In Jilin Province, Wang Delin's troops have 10,000 men under Zhang Peng, Yao Zhenfeng, Li Yanlu, Zheng Hanqing, and Wu Shichen, as well as 10,000 men under Chen Zongdai, his loyal subordinate, 5,000 under Zhou Wanqing, and 3,000 each under Li Futing, Li Tengyun, and Lu Yongcai, and 1,000 each under Li Jichang and Zhao Mingshan, all continuing to fight. If they receive adequate support, their strength is still not to be underestimated. As for the people, they are all filled with righteous indignation and will immediately take up arms if someone calls on them. The fact that they were able to hold out for so long was also due to the cooperation of the local people.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Yan's Welcome and Reception</h3>
<p>Ambassador Yan inquired in detail about the current situation in the Northeast. Ma and the others also asked about the diplomatic situation. They unanimously agreed that they should rely on their own efforts and engage in long-term resistance. Since Ma and the others entered the Soviet Union, they have been treated very well. They had great freedom in Tomsk. The special train was also well-equipped. Fearing that they would not be accustomed to Western food, they had prepared rice and many canned goods. While in Moscow, the authorities allowed prominent figures to go out and sightsee. However, Ma and the others did not want to get off the train because of the limited time. Therefore, Yan specially prepared Chinese food and steamed buns and sent them to the train, and sent the secretary, Zeng Shuming, and the attendant, Gou Zengqi, to accompany them to Poland. The special train then departed for the Russian border at 3:00 PM, expecting to arrive in Berlin on the 20th. It is said that the embassy in Germany has sent Secretary Tan Baoshen to the Polish border to greet them and prepare all the procedures for their return home. (April 20) Central News Agency</p>
<h3>Shen Honglie Talks About Coastal Defense Situation: Coastline Peaceful, Coastal Defense Prepared</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Shen Honglie, Mayor of Qingdao and concurrently Navy Commander, due to the drastic changes in the front line situation and the tension in Pingjin (Peiping &amp; Tianjin), the coastal defense of North China has become particularly important. He departed from Qingdao on a warship to inspect the coastline and review the ships under his command. When the ship arrived in Weihai, he received telegrams from He Yingqin, Chairman of the Military Affairs Committee of the Beiping Branch, and Huang Fu, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Committee, summoning him. He then traveled from Weihai to Tianjin on the 15th and took a train to Beiping to meet with the two chairmen, He and Huang, to report on the coastal defense situation. He also met with a group of Northeast dignitaries such as Wan Fulin. After completing his business, he took train number 201 from Pingpu (Beiping to Pukou) south yesterday. The train arrived in Jinan at 9:15 this morning. Having been previously notified, Han Fuqu, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, Zhang Weicun, Secretary of the Provincial Committee, and Cheng Xixian, Senior Advisor to the Provincial Government, all went to the station to welcome him. After getting off the train, Mr. Shen greeted the welcomers one by one and went to the Jiaoji Hotel to rest. The reporter visited him to ask about the mission to the north and the coastal situation. Mr. Shen's remarks are as follows:</p>
<h3>Coastal Defense Consolidated</h3>
<p>Shen Honglie said, "I departed from Qingdao and traveled to Weihai, Yantai, and Dagu to inspect the coastal situation. It is as peaceful as usual. Japanese warships usually do not go to Weihai. However, three Japanese warships suddenly arrived in Weihai a few days ago and stopped briefly, causing people to be alarmed and suspicious. After I arrived, I told them that the Japanese warships were passing through and had no other purpose, which calmed people down. There have been no Japanese warships in Yantai and Dagu recently. There was a Japanese aircraft carrier in Tanggu before, but it has now returned to Lushun and is on its way back to Japan. The situation along the way is generally like this. I went to Tianjin and then to Beiping because I was summoned by Chairman He and Huang in Weihai. I met with He and Huang and reported on the coastal defense situation and made some requests. Originally, the coastal defense of North China had considerable plans and there is nothing to worry about."</p>
<h3>Soldiers and Civilians Defend Tianjin to the Death</h3>
<p>The current situation in Pingjin is still quiet, not as serious as reported. Although plainclothes troops lurking in Tianjin fired a few shots on the night of the 19th, the local order is still very stable, and the military police are also very calm. Whether it is the government authorities, the generals and soldiers of the various armies, or the local people, they all advocate defending Pingjin to the death. If the enemy comes, they will do their best to fight them and will never give up lightly. The situation is very good. I am returning tonight because my work is completed.</p>
<p>According to Han Fuqu, Chairman of the Provincial Government and concurrently Commander-in-Chief of the Third Route Army, reports that he would go to Beiping are inaccurate. The Beiping Political Affairs Committee is indefinitely postponed, and he will not go for the time being. The situation in Pingjin is generally the same as reported in the newspapers. Regarding peaceful solutions, it is said that the Japanese government ordered Major General Sakagaki, a Japanese national in Tianjin, to handle the matter, but Sakagaki did not obey his government's orders.

<h3>Chiang Kai-shek Orders Liu Xiang to Stop the Sichuan War; Deng Xihou, Tian Songyao, etc. Support Liu Xiang as the Alliance Leader and Send Troops to Suppress the Rebellion</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since the 24th Army first launched its attack, the internal strife between Liu Xiang and Deng Xihou in Sichuan Province has seen the 28th Army make successive concessions in order to preserve its strength, giving up Wenjiang, Jianyang, Zizhong, and Lezhi one after another. As a result, the Pi River line became the battlefield for a duel between two heroes. Attacking and defending, neither side gained an advantage. Liu Wenhui was eager for a quick battle, encouraging his soldiers to launch another general offensive. Fierce battles have been fought in Jinmachang, Sandao Yan, Sanjiang Tuo, Banzhuyuan, Chongning, and Guanxian in recent days, especially concentrating artillery fire to attack Chongning and Guanxian. Civilian houses inside and outside the city were destroyed by heavy artillery fire, and many people were sacrificed to the artillery fire. Deng's troops knew that they could not hold on, so they abandoned Chongning and Guanxian and gathered all their forces on the north bank of the Pi River, holding firmly against the river. As a result, a stalemate was formed again. While commanding the war, Liu and Deng also wooed various envoys to help them. Lobbyists and strategists rushed to and fro on the road, Chongqing being the center of this gathering. Liu Xiang's military strength was strong and he could definitely sway the balance. However, Liu Xiang preferred to see the two heroes fight each other and refused to express his attitude. Although he received a telegram from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek ordering him to be responsible for mediation, he only sent telegrams to both sides, making a superficial attempt to persuade them. Deng Xihou gradually felt unsupported after the abandonment of Chongning and Guanxian, so he supported Liu Xiang as the alliance leader. Tian Songyao, Liu Cunhou, Yang Sen, and Deng, allied together, also sent telegrams to Liu, expressing their support on the condition of eliminating the 24th Army. Liu, because his defense area was adjacent to the 24th Army, could help Deng to attack Liu's rear and expand his territory. If he helped Liu (Wenhui), he would have to consolidate his rear and gain no advantage. Moreover, Tian Songyao, Liu Cunhou, Yang Sen, and others all expressed their support for Deng, so he decided to accept Deng's support. He summoned representatives from all sides to a secret meeting in Chongqing, deciding on a plan to unify Sichuan, forcing Liu (Wenhui) to step down. With all parties in agreement, Liu immediately ordered Li Qixiang and Luo Zezhou's troops to concentrate in Lezhi and Yang counties and advance towards Zizhong and Jianyang. The troops of Pan Wenhua, Wang Zejun, and Fan Shaozeng advanced from Luzhou, Fushun, and Zigong towards Qianwei, Jiading, and Jingyan to suppress the 24th Army. Liu Wenhui did not attach much importance to Tian and Deng, but he was always wary of Liu Xiang. After the Yu (Chongqing) army was mobilized, he dispatched elite troops to protect Jiajiang and Qianwei. No more reinforcements were sent to the Pi River front. Looking at the overall situation, Liu Xiang, Deng Xihou, Tian Songyao, Liu Cunhou, and Yang Sen have indeed formed a secret alliance, which is completely different from the situation of a temporary alliance. Liu Wenhui, with himself as the target of public criticism, is in an extremely dangerous situation. If this drags on, the Pi River will not be crossed and Jiajiang and Qianwei will be lost first. Liu's demise is imminent. While arranging military affairs, Liu Xiang also received a telegram from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek ordering him to stop the war and avoid mutual slaughter. On the 23rd, he sent separate telegrams to Liu and Deng urging them to cease hostilities, using extremely stern language. The telegram stated, "Commander Liu of Chengdu and Commander Deng of Hanzhou, I previously sent a telegram urging you to cease hostilities. However, reports indicate that the war zone is spreading and expanding. I was about to send another telegram when I received a telegram from Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek, stating that he had received telegrams from all parties in Sichuan, saying that the strife between the Qian and Jin troops had erupted into war. At a time when North China is threatened and Pingjin is shaken, and the Red bandits in Sichuan and Jiangxi are rampant, if we disregard everything and start an internal strife, killing each other, how can we seek forgiveness from the people of the country? I am heartbroken by the news. I have already earnestly telegraphed Qian and Jin, ordering them to return to their original defenses. I hope you will use righteousness to reprimand them and quickly stop the fighting and find a way to quell it. This will not only benefit the country but also secure Sichuan. Please telegram me the details of the prevention and the actual situation on all sides. I believe that the country is in dire straits and deeply troubled. It is already too late to save it together. Instead, we are using the weapons of the same room, even breaking dams to achieve our goals, causing harm to the people and resentment. The bad news has been heart-wrenching. The central government's reprimands are increasing daily, and the local situation is deteriorating. What will be the outcome of this prolonged conflict? Both of you are patriotic and love your hometown, and I hope that you will follow the central government's instructions and immediately cease hostilities and wait for a solution. If you remain obstinate and persist in your own way, you will not only isolate yourselves from the people but also become a laughingstock to the nations. I, Xiang, am duty-bound and dare not be indifferent, disregarding the people in the area. I earnestly state my words, and I ask for your understanding. Liu Xiang respectfully bows, (24th)</p>
<h3>Xu Yuanquan Assumes Office as Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in Western Hubei</h3>
<p>He Long's bandits Fled into Hunan and were Blocked but Still Returned to the Old Nest in Wuhe; Xu Will Set off to the Frontline Within Days, Ordering a General Suppression</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Western Hubei borders Sichuan and Hunan, and its mountainous terrain has always been a haven for bandits. The Red bandit He Long has been particularly unable to forget this place. He has occupied it three times and has spared no effort in managing it. Fan Xiji, the Director of the Security Department, was ordered by Chiang Kai-shek to supervise the suppression and penetrated into Enshi. He learned that the bandit was skilled in avoiding the real and attacking the weak. He then ordered the bandit area to be blockaded to cut off its supply. On the one hand, he advanced step by step. After the implementation of this plan, He's bandits were trapped, and his subordinates gradually disintegrated. He then convened a meeting of the bandit leaders, deciding to find another way to survive. His initial intention was to attack Honghu, but after two failures, he dared not try again lightly. He also took advantage of the unpreparedness of the Hunan army to flee into Hunan. A few days ago, He Long volunteered to select elite troops and set off from Wuyaguan, advancing rapidly towards western Hunan. When he reached Xizhai, the Hunan army waited in ambush and defeated him in one fell swoop. He Long had no choice but to lead the remnants of his troops back to Wuhe. From a recent perspective, he has become an arrow at the end of its flight. Xu Yuanquan, the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in Western Hubei, with his rich experience in bandit suppression, has assumed this important post. He has assumed office in Jiangling on the 22nd and will set off to the front line within days, ordering a general suppression. However, although He Long's bandits are exhausted, their ability to incite is extremely strong. This is because the counties in western Hubei are far from the province, the political administration is not yet developed, and the local defense teams are mostly untrained and have weak self-defense capabilities. They will come out at the first sign of trouble. In addition, local tyrants and gentry control the defense funds, often owing salaries, which often leads to riots, increasing the strength of the bandits. For example, the mutiny of the Third Squadron of Songzi a month ago and the unrest of a certain battalion in Zhijiang are clear examples. As for the poor people, they are particularly susceptible to coercion. Therefore, unless the area is thoroughly cleansed, it is not possible to be too optimistic. In eastern Hubei, the main force of the bandits is still in the territory of Huangma. A recent force has fled to Yingshan, and the county seat is in imminent danger. After the 47th Division of Shangguan Yunxiang launched an attack, they fled again to Huoshan in Anhui. Although the bandit suppression troops are now concentrated separately, Liu Zhenhua has not yet assumed the new post of Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the Henan, Hubei, and Anhui Border Area, so a general suppression has not yet begun. However, the troops in each county are well-equipped and are being commanded by Chen Jicheng and Wei Lihuang to suppress the bandits. There is no chance of a resurgence. As for the traffic on the southern section of the Pinghan (Beiping to Hankou) Railway, a certain unit is responsible for maintaining it. The tracks destroyed by the bandits in Hengdian a few days ago have been completely repaired. (24th)</p>
<h3>Overview of Jiangsu Province's Conscripted Labor for River Dredging</h3>
<p>This year, 384 rivers throughout the province are being dredged, benefiting over 20 million mu of farmland. Jiangsu Province is characterized by rivers and lakes, and while it benefits greatly from water resources, it also suffers significantly from water-related disasters. In recent years, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction has made considerable progress in water conservancy projects. The previous year, breaches in the Grand Canal dike caused severe losses in various counties north of the Yangtze River. In addition to the establishment of the Grand Canal Project Rehabilitation Committee by the provincial government to handle dike restoration, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction also ordered all counties to undertake work-relief projects such as dike repair and river dredging. These projects commenced in the winter of the 20th year [of the Republic] and were largely completed by the winter of the 21st year. However, many rivers throughout the province were heavily silted. Considering the severity of the previous year's disaster, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction recognized that large-scale river dredging was essential to prevent future disasters, and that preventing disasters was crucial to rescuing the rural economy. Therefore, during a conference of construction bureau chiefs from across the province held in October of the previous year, the planning of conscripted labor for river dredging was prioritized. After the conference, the "Jiangsu Province Conscripted Labor for River Dredging Regulations" was drafted and submitted to the provincial government committee for amendment and approval. This regulation consists of 16 articles, with four key points: (1) Adhering to Sun Yat-sen's legacy of obligatory labor, utilizing slack farming seasons to carry out beneficial projects with minimal expenditure. (2) County magistrates, construction bureau chiefs, impartial gentry, and people's representatives serve as the main entities for organizing conscripted labor for river dredging, fostering cooperation between officials and the people, with the aim of organizing and training the populace. (3) For rivers involving two or more counties, joint management by the counties is stipulated to facilitate progress. (4) Funding for conscripted labor for river dredging is provided by each county's water conservancy land tax or a portion of construction funds and road construction land tax, supplemented by special government subsidies, charitable organizations, and contributions from the people. Expenditures are capped at 20 to 50 yuan per li (unit of distance) to ensure cost-effectiveness. Subsequently, detailed implementation rules for conscripted labor for river dredging, organizational regulations for the conscripted labor for river dredging committee, provisional regulations for the collection, management, and disbursement of substitute payments for conscripted labor for river dredging, reward and punishment regulations for conscripted labor for river dredging, river survey forms, and simplified measurement and design methods were successively formulated, providing detailed guidelines for procedures and steps. Notably, these include: (1) Each county must dredge 100 to 300 kilometers of rivers annually. (2) Rivers are to be dredged annually, every three years, or every five years, depending on their size. (3) Regulations for fair conscription or substitute payments are established. After the drafting of these regulations and rules, they were successively promulgated to various counties starting from the beginning of November of the previous year, ordering them to actively implement them. By the end of November, all counties were ordered to fill out forms for the rivers to be dredged that year within a week, submit them for verification, and complete measurement and design according to the simplified measurement and design methods promulgated by the Department of Construction within a month, followed by construction. Conscripted labor for river dredging committees were required to report their establishment by December 10, and river dredging teams were to be organized within half a month after the establishment of the river dredging committees. At the same time, a public announcement regarding conscripted labor for river dredging was issued to mobilize the people to actively participate. The above describes,</p>
<p>The general situation of the pre-planning preparations of the Jiangsu Construction Department for the conscripted labor river dredging. However, since the matter is a novel initiative, local areas lacked sufficient experience, and the weather was severely cold with snow on the roads, the preparations were inevitably delayed. In addition, due to the heavy workload of local governments, county authorities leading the populace were not always able to devote their full attention to this matter. As of late January of this year, only 18 counties had reported initiating projects, less than one-third of the province. Deeply concerned that the opportunity would pass and implementation would become difficult, the Jiangsu Construction Department divided the province's conscripted labor for river dredging into seven districts, dispatching supervising engineers to each district to provide guidance and oversight, and strictly ordering all counties that had not yet commenced to begin work within ten days of receiving the order. At the same time, a second public announcement was issued, listing four key points: ensuring ample food supply, rescuing financial institutions, stabilizing society, and resolving the national crisis, and earnestly exhorting the populace. Following this strict oversight, conscripted labor for river dredging gradually showed signs of activity. Unfortunately, between January and February of this year, changes in county organizations, with the separation, retention, restructuring, and creation of sections and offices within county-level bureaus and offices, inevitably dealt a significant blow to conscripted labor for river dredging during this period of transition. Subsequently, the provincial government issued thirteen points for county magistrates to observe, the first of which was that conscripted labor for river dredging must be expedited. In early March, the provincial government again strictly ordered all counties to rapidly advance conscripted labor for river dredging, requiring reporting every five days and a comprehensive report every ten days. From then on, conscripted labor for river dredging projects in various counties became much more active. As of the end of the Western month, during these two months, which was the period of the most strenuous conscripted labor river dredging, statistics from various counties reported that 57 counties had undertaken projects, with over 20 counties having completed them and over 20 counties still in progress. Only Lishui, Xinghua, Yancheng, and Yizheng counties were exempt from reconscription for one year, as they had already implemented conscripted labor for road construction, or because they were not prepared in time and declared that they would postpone implementation until autumn. Statistics from counties that had undertaken projects showed that a total of 384 rivers were planned to be dredged, with a total length of 4,377 kilometers. Before the busy farming season, over 30 million cubic meters of earth could be excavated. Among the rivers, the largest projects were the Hua River in the south of the Yangtze River and the Liutang River in the north. The Liu River is the main river of Lou River, which is one of the ancient Taihu Three Rivers, and is of great importance to water conservancy in the south of the Yangtze River. Because it exchanges with the Yangtze River tide, it is prone to siltation. In January of this year, Kunshan, Taicang, Shishan, and Jiading counties jointly established a joint committee to organize the conscripted labor, and the Jiangsu Construction Department sent Jie Zheng Xia Zhouzhi to oversee the project. The entire river is 20 kilometers long, with 430,000 cubic meters of earth excavated, costing approximately 100,000 yuan, benefiting over 100,000 mu of farmland. The dredging ceremony and opening of the dam took place on May 10. The Liutang River in the north of the Yangtze River is an important channel for discharging the Yi River. Because the river is silted, the Yi River cannot flow smoothly into the sea, and often overflows and floods, causing disasters in Huaibei. In addition, the South Canal of Daye in Shandong has dried up and become farmland, and Huaibei, located downstream, is even more afraid of the neighboring valley. Therefore, dredging the Liutang River to prepare for any eventuality is an urgent plan. However, the scope of the project involves Qixian counties, including Su, Si, Huai, Lian, Shu, Hai, and Guan, and the river body to be dredged is over 55 kilometers long, with over 4 million cubic meters of earth to be excavated, requiring approximately 20,000 laborers and costing 275,000 yuan. The Jiangsu Construction Department has sent personnel to various counties to organize a joint committee and establish an office. All preparations are now complete, and large-scale construction can begin this autumn, first clearing the high sections so that the water can return to the sea along the channel, and then continuing to widen and deepen the river within three years to complete the dredging. In summary, if all conscripted labor for river dredging projects in the province are completed, over 20 million mu of farmland will benefit. Assuming that each mu increases grain yield by an average of two shi per year due to improved water conservancy and reduced disasters, over 40 million shi of grain can be added each year, which is truly good news for rescuing the future of the rural economy. However, because the season is approaching Xiaoman (Minor Full), and agricultural work is gradually becoming busy, various counties have requested the Jiangsu Construction Department to postpone the work on rivers that have already started but have not been completed until autumn. It is reported that the Department has considered the urgency of the situation and has largely approved the requests.</p>
<h3>Zhoucun Silk Merchants Request Relief Funds from Shandong Provincial Government</h3>
<p>Request 500,000 Yuan to Subsidize the Sale of Stored Silk</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Linqu in this province is the largest silk-producing area, and Zhoucun is also the center of the cocoon and silk industry, with numerous silk factories. However, due to years of economic depletion, the silk industry is on the verge of bankruptcy. 2,800 boxes of stored silk are accumulating in Shanghai, and capital is tied up, making it impossible to turn over. Last year, the Provincial Government, based on the request of Zhoucun silk merchants, consulted the Ministry of Industry to increase the import tax on rayon in order to subsidize the stored silk. The Ministry of Industry rejected the request, stating that the rayon tax was already very high, and asked the Provincial Government to find other ways to provide relief. The matter remains unresolved to this day. Last year, Linqu silk merchants were approved by the Provincial Government to issue one million yuan in relief bonds, which they relied on to operate. This year, as the silkworm season approaches, they have again requested approval to issue 500,000 yuan, which is currently being processed. Last month, Zhoucun silk merchants also requested an exception, requesting approval to issue 200,000 yuan in Zhoucun relief bonds. The Department of Industry is in the process of submitting this to the Provincial Government. Given the precedent set by Linqu, there is hope for approval. However, Li Huafeng, the representative of Zhoucun silk merchants (and Chairman of the Zhoucun Chamber of Commerce), has now submitted a request to the Department of Industry, changing his request. He has declared the previous request to issue 200,000 yuan in relief bonds terminated and instead requests that the Provincial Government allocate 500,000 yuan to subsidize the stored silk. His stated reasons are that, last year, during the silkworm season, each family raising silkworms, because of the Japanese (Suzuki Silk Factory) monopoly and the complete shutdown of Chinese silk factories, suffered a sharp drop in cocoon prices. Some, in anger, felled their mulberry trees and stopped raising silkworms. Therefore, this year, the cocoon production near Zhoucun has been greatly reduced, only reaching one-third of what it used to be (the peak production was 800,000 to 900,000 catties, but this year it is only 200,000 to 300,000 catties). The cocoon price is also only about 2 jiao. The previous request of silk merchants to issue silk industry relief bonds was originally intended to be used to purchase cocoons and reel silk. Unexpectedly, this year's silkworm cocoon harvest is so poor. Moreover, Japanese merchants purchase cocoons with cash, while silk merchants purchase cocoons with relief bonds, which is likely insufficient to compete with Japanese merchants. Therefore, it is unavoidable to terminate the previous request and instead request the government to subsidize the stored silk. Because the province has 2,800 boxes of stored silk that have been accumulating in Shanghai for a long time, and the central government is unwilling to provide relief, the only option is to request that the Provincial Government allocate 500,000 yuan to subsidize the sale of the stored silk (subsidizing each box by 100 taels of silver, totaling 280,000 taels, which is approximately 500,000 yuan) in order to rescue the endangered silk industry. Wang Fangting, the Director of the Department of Industry, noted that the merchant had previously requested to issue 200,000 yuan in relief bonds, but now requests to terminate this and instead request 500,000 yuan to subsidize the stored silk. In this time of local decline, poverty, and financial exhaustion, it is not easy to raise such a large sum of 500,000 yuan. However, the government is paying close attention to the silk industry and will make every effort to provide relief if possible. Therefore, he has telegraphed Zhoucun, summoning the silk merchant representative Li Huafeng to Jinan in order to discuss relief measures. It is reported that the silk price was over 600 taels last year, but has fallen to over 500 taels this year. Even if the government subsidizes 100 taels, bringing the price back to the 600 taels of last year, sales will still be difficult.</p>
<h3>Dr. Hörner of the Sino-Swedish Archaeological Expedition Discusses the Exploration of Mongolia</h3>
<p>Discovery of reed beds and abundant water sources in the New Darin River</p>
<p>Only saw humans twice during seven months of desert exploration</p>
<p>Beijing Special Dispatch: Dr. Nils Hörner (geologist) and Dr. Porkerc Chen (geologist and soil scientist), members of the Sino-Swedish Archaeological Expedition, have returned to Beijing after working in the Mongolian desert for four years, bringing back a large number of specimens. He said that the experience of working in the desert was very interesting. The biggest difficulties of desert life are the lack of water and grass, which is inconvenient everywhere. Because his companions had not had their hair cut for a long time, their hair was fluffy, and because they had no water to bathe in, they had accumulated dirt like beggars. Only the cook was able to wash his hands with water before cooking. The livestock they brought were also very hard-pressed. On one occasion, they even used the dry grass in the saddles as feed. The temperature was often below minus 40 degrees, and they lived in tents, eating large pancakes made of salt water and flour, and did not know what it tasted like. However, all of his companions endured hunger and cold for the sake of scientific exploration. According to Dr. Hörner's recent speech in Beijing, he left Sweden in April 1929 and, after arriving in Beijing, met with Dr. Bohlin (archaeologist), Dr. Bergman (archaeologist), Mr. Bexer (botanical archaeologist), Dr. Zheng, and Mr. Jennasson of Denmark. His party left Beijing in October 1929 and arrived at the Etsingol River in early May of the following year. The river runs directly through the middle of the desert, and the local Mongols also call it by this name. The Sino-Swedish Archaeological Expedition has established a meteorological station there. Continuing forward, he passed through the ruins of the ancient city of Khara khoto in Marco Polo's Travels. After arriving in Suzhou, his party divided into two groups. Hörner and Dr. Zheng, carrying horses, donkeys, plows, and other necessities, went to the Lan Mountain Range to study the current and ancient water and river conditions. The Lan Mountain Range is up to 18,000 feet above sea level, and its danger and magnificence are no less than those of the Alps. He (Dr. Hörner) originally planned to return to the Etsingol River after completing his work there to find out the cause of the desert and test the climate change. However, while his work was still in progress, Dr. Hedin happened to have a letter ordering him to go to Lop Nur. Hedin himself had been there in 1900. According to Dr. Hedin's letter, the location of Lop Nur changes from time to time, sometimes to the south and sometimes to the north, which is a very strange phenomenon. The rivers flowing into Lop Nur often change their course due to sand and gravel siltation. In old Chinese maps, the location of Lop Nur is in the north of the desert. In the middle of the 19th century, explorers suddenly discovered that the lake was in the south of the desert, and therefore believed that the map was inaccurate. However, in 1900, the remains of a civilization dating back 2,000 years were discovered in the northern desert, which proved that the above statement was not wrong. After receiving Hedin's letter, he and Dr. Zheng took the road to Dunhuang, the end of the fertile land in China, and purchased some necessary supplies before heading to Lop Nur. He hoped to find water in the Suluh River, as the famous British explorer Stein had done. Unfortunately, the river has now dried up, leaving only a few small salt water pools. He collected a lot of snow along the way for food. Finally, he found a place with water and settled down temporarily until Christmas before moving forward. On that day, he spread a white cloth on a wooden box and ate rice, meat, and salty water, which was considered a celebration. The next day, he continued to move forward and soon reached the salt flats in the old Lop Nur. Because the salt was crystallized, the ground was extremely rugged, and the camels were very painful to walk. Their feet were injured and bleeding all over the ground, turning the road red. In order to reduce the suffering of the livestock, he wrapped the camel's feet in thin yak leather. Although he had been very frugal with water along the way, it was now almost exhausted. Looking north from this vast salt area, it was endless and without any life. On December 30, 1930, he arrived at the new Lop Nur. The salt was shining white, like a pile of snow. The cohesion of the water in the lake was extremely high, and the water was full of crystallized salt. He passed through the Yardang field, which was purely a muddy land, with many holes formed by the wind. By this time, the camels were mostly exhausted and unable to bear the burden, often lying down and unable to get up. People had to walk on foot. The only encouragement was the hope that he would find a river before reaching the towering mountains to the north. On January 8, after fourteen efforts to move forward, he finally reached the new Darin River after he and his camel were extremely tired. He found many reed beds and abundant water sources there. He returned to the original place on April 1 and continued his work. He arrived in Dunhuang on July 1. In the past seven months, he had only seen humans twice, namely, the two trips of the envoys of the Karashar Mongol Prince. Because the situation was unstable, he and Dr. Zheng took a short rest in Dunhuang and then went to the Lan Mountain Range to study glaciers. Two days before Christmas in 1931, on his way back to the Etsingol River, he was able to witness a plane flying from Beijing to Xinjiang. If he had taken a plane, he could have reached his destination in one day. If he had abandoned the train and camel, he would have needed to travel for more than forty days, which was a wonderful contrast. The pilots of the Eurasia Airlines landed and talked with him, and told him news from home. He and Dr. Zheng worked in the paradise near the Etsingol River, together with the peaceful and friendly residents, as well as the flying springs and green trees, for a year and a half. He built a tent on the sand dunes to study the causes of the desert. The local people often regarded him as crazy, because whenever the weather was fine and sunny, he would not take a step out of the tent, but when the sand and stones were flying, he would go out and look around. He left Etsingol on April 1, 1933 and reached the railway station after 32 days of travel, and then returned to Beijing. The most regrettable thing about his trip back to the north was the disappearance of Dr. Nils Ambolt. Ambolt had high hopes and took a camel to Xinjiang, but unfortunately, he came to such an end. The members of the Sino-Swedish Archaeological Expedition are very concerned about this matter and have decided to send people to make every effort to rescue him. He intends to return to Sweden this summer, but the date has not yet been determined. He has suffered a lot for the sake of scientific research, and now he should have a longer period of recuperation.</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Sudden Drop in Rice Prices Causes Disputes, Da Zhang Jingfengtai Rice Store, Recently sent personnel to various rice stores in Zhangze, Punan to purchase more than 500 dan of brown rice, and set a date for loading and transportation. Later, due to the drop in rice prices, a loss of more than one yuan per stone occurred. When the date arrived, they did not go to load the rice. The rice stores negotiated with the store, but the store denied it, and the partner of the store, Ren Dakai, came forward to admit that he had ordered it himself to make a small profit, which had nothing to do with Fengtai. Now the loss is even greater, so the rice stores in Zhangze have independently loaded the rice to Songjiang and parked in front of the Fengtai store, eager to hand over the rice, but it is not known how to resolve it.</p>
<h3>Jiading</h3>

<p>Teenager Electrocuted and Killed</p>
<p>There is a boy named Xiao Mazi A'er from Qingyang, 16 years old, who has been helping Gao, who is engaged in hunting in Gaoxiang near Ximen in Beiyi, to shake the hunting boat. At about 4 pm on the 24th, A'er went to play near the electrified iron tower in the mulberry field of Xidiaoyaoqiao. Soon after, he climbed up and climbed to the top of the tower, when he was suddenly electrocuted. The Fangpengjian nearby learned of this and immediately turned off the current. A'er fell downwards, and his head hit the iron bar of the iron tower, forming a hole in his throat, but he still did not fall down. After the workers managed to take him down, it was too late to save him. He died of suffocation. His skin was blue and black all over, and blood flowed like a note from his throat. The scene was very tragic. The body is now being guarded by Tupheng, and people have been instructed to inform the family of the deceased to come to Xishou for burial.</p>
<h3>Spring Cocoon Market News Summary</h3>
<p>Recently, the weather has been mild and the spring silkworms in our county are doing well. The early batches have already gone up the frame.</p>
<p>The Chengtai, Qian, Sheng, Zhenyi, and other silk factories in our county have gone to Hangzhou and Xiaoshan in Zhejiang Province to collect cocoons. They started weighing three or four days ago. Improved varieties of silkworm cocoons are priced at 32 yuan, and local varieties are priced at 22 yuan. However, the cocoon body is not good, and the reeling is larger. The Cocoon Industry Association of our county previously received an order from the county magistrate to use new scales this year, and the county party department also resolved in yesterday's committee meeting to order the use of new scales. However, the association stated that there was not enough time to change them, so they specially stated the difficulties and submitted a report to the county to postpone the implementation. In addition, the association stated that the cocoon shops in our county have always paid cash for cocoons and do not owe cocoon households. In recent years, a small number of speculators have owed cocoon households at high prices, issued blank checks, and committed all kinds of fraud, which is very dangerous for cocoon households. Yesterday, they also submitted a report to the county to prohibit this, and Feng Junyan, the head of the sixth district, also requested a strict ban. The county government has ordered the public security bureau to transfer the ban to the public security bureau. In addition, the Business Tax Bureau of our county previously sent a letter to the Cocoon Industry Association stating that the business tax on the cocoon industry this year was ordered to be reduced by two-thousandths. Please transfer the order to the cocoon merchants to register, receive certificates, and pay taxes. The association stated that the cocoon shops in our county all have cocoon posts, which are valid for ten years, and stipulate that each stove must pay one yuan per year, which is different from the cocoon shops in Zhejiang Province that pay temporary posts, so yesterday they sent a letter to the bureau and submitted it to the county for verification. In addition, the Ministry of Railways stated that the silk industry in our country has been declining in recent years, and it is now the cocoon season, so the freight rate for silkworms and cocoons has been reduced to help the people of Jiangsu. Yesterday, the two-way headquarters ordered the Xishang station to notify the public.</p>
<h3>Six Thugs Gang Rape a Young Girl</h3>
<p>In the fifth district of the county, in the Handong Township, Hengpaiwei, manual laborers such as water workers, carpenters, tailors, and hired workers, etc., aiming to raise wages and rectify industry regulations, followed the usual practice of staging two operas to inform everyone. Unexpectedly, after the play ended and the audience dispersed, it was already after midnight. Da Nian, the daughter of Qin A'er from Qinxiang Town, was walking home alone after watching the play. While passing through the Douwei Corner area, six rogue youths suddenly emerged from a mulberry field and forcibly dragged Da Nian into a wheat field, where they took turns raping her in order. The incident lasted until two and a half hours had passed, before they scattered in a panic. Da Nian, suffering from this violent assault, crawled to the edge of the field and cried out for help. A passerby, Jiang A'er, ran to inform her family, who carried her back and called for a doctor. However, Da Nian is only nineteen years old and already betrothed to Ruiyuan, the son of Chen Nanlin from a neighboring village. Qin A'er, accused of allowing his daughter to watch the opera late at night and suffer this humiliation, losing family ethics, has been asked for a divorce.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Robbing Wheat and Setting Fire, Burning an Old Woman to Death In Shazhou City, Fourth District, Duanshan South Jia, Dangousha area, there is a Sha farmer named Cao Yinnian who cultivates over a thousand mu of Sha land. Now is the time for harvesting wheat, and he had specially built over thirty thatched huts for farmers to rest. Unexpectedly, the other day (the 23rd), Sha bullies Huang Zhulou's associates Huang Shan, Chen Xiaowu, Chen Ximei, Sha Zaitang, Zhou Sheng, and others, led over a hundred followers to Cao's field to cut wheat and set fire to the thatched huts. Cao's side, outnumbered, urgently reported to the police squad for suppression. Unexpectedly, Huang's party openly resisted with weapons, and the police squad withdrew in disarray. Huang's party pursued relentlessly, capturing four individuals including Deputy Squad Leader Qi Youcai, Cang Qing, Hou Baoming, and the Squad Leader. Later, three were rescued, but they had been severely beaten. Subsequently, six more followers were apprehended and escorted to the county on the 24th. Upon arrival at the dock, another five followers were captured. After interrogation by the county government, eleven individuals including Jin Bao, Zhou Sheng, and Sun Liubao were detained. However, Huang's party in the countryside remained unwilling to give up. On the morning of the 24th, they again burned Cao's thatched huts, resulting in the death of an old woman over fifty years old. The county government scheduled an inspection for the 25th.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Trial Implementation of County Water Patrol Joint Squads The water patrol squads of various counties in Jiangsu Province have not been formed due to difficulties in raising funds. Ye Zhendong, the Administrative Inspector of the Seventh District, submitted a proposal to the Department of Civil Affairs to form joint water patrol squads by administrative district. Each county would have a maximum of two squadrons, at least one squadron, or a minimum of two counties jointly forming one squadron. The necessary expenses would be allocated separately by each county. The Department of Civil Affairs has now ordered Inspector Ye to conduct a trial run in the Seventh District. He will soon convene the county chiefs of Nantong, Haimen, Rugao, Chongming, and Qidong to discuss implementation jointly.</p>

<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Abbot of Temple Detained for Unpaid Grain County Magistrate Ma, who also serves as County Chief, urged the Buddhist Association to pay taxes, but there were pretexts for procrastination. Yesterday, he specifically summoned four monks from the county: Hengchun, the abbot of Chongning Temple; Zhihai, the abbot of Jinghui Temple; Yangzhi, the abbot of Shangfang Temple; and Yinguang, the abbot of Dizang Temple. After questioning by Section Chief Tang of the Second Section, they were handed over to the Detective Squad for custody. The county government also ordered Liao Chuliang, the Chief of the First Public Security Branch, to lead over a dozen police officers, together with Faquan, the Chairman of the Buddhist Association, to convene monks from various monasteries at the Jingzhong Temple to raise funds. It is reported that the monks have agreed to pay four thousand yuan first, to be submitted to the county within three days. As for the detained monks, they have been handed over to Branch Chief Liao for supervision. The temples must submit a limited statement clarifying their unpaid taxes before they can be released. In addition, Branch Chief Liao has been ordered to dispatch more police officers to guard and extract rent records from the temples, to be submitted to the county by last night (the 24th).</p>
<h3>Touqiao Town Suffers Six Consecutive Robberies by Bandits</h3>
<p>In the third district of this county, the bandits are rampant, and kidnapping cases occur frequently. The Touqiao Town in the district was suddenly visited by forty to fifty bandits the night before last, who robbed the town. Those robbed included the Yuhexing general merchandise and cloth store, the postal agency, the Yuchengxing general merchandise and cloth store, the Yuanqingchang butcher shop, the Zhu Yuwen rice shop, and the E Zhengda general merchandise store, among others. The losses were quite substantial.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Knife Society Opens Fire on Bandits Villagers in the Suyaxiang area of the tenth district of the county are facing rampant banditry. Consequently, the villages have organized Knife Societies to protect their families. Unexpectedly, the night before last, over forty bandits suddenly arrived at Dongjiadun, intending to loot the entire village. The Knife Society members resisted the bandits, engaging in fierce fighting throughout the night, until dawn the next day when the bandits fled southeast. It is reported that on the Knife Society side, three were killed in action and one was wounded. The township head has now come to the city to report the case to the county government.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Major Fire in Linping Town Linping Town in Hang County is a prosperous commercial center with a dense population, a major town in the county. At 3:35 AM on the 24th, the Shufang Tea Garden on East Main Street in the town accidentally caught fire, causing a fire alarm (one theory suggests that it was caused by a late-night banquet at the Maochangxiang Cloth Store). At that time, the general residents were awakened from their sleep. The town's fire brigade and others rushed to put out the fire, but due to the narrow streets and difficulty in obtaining water, it was impossible to extinguish it. The local district office and public security bureau urgently telegraphed the county government, requesting the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau's fire brigade to dispatch modern fire engines to provide assistance. The fire was finally extinguished at around 6:00 AM. It is estimated that from the Maochangxiang Cloth Store on East Main Street westward to the Hengdaxiang Foreign Goods Store, and around the corner to the Yingfeng Hotel, northward to the Han Yongxing Tinware Store, a total of thirty-eight businesses of various sizes and over a hundred houses were burned down. The losses amounted to over 200,000 yuan. The owners of the initial fire spots, Guo of Shufang Garden and He of Maochangxiang, have both been escorted to the Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>

<h3>Local News</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Issues Important Statement on the Current Situation</p>
<p>Negotiated Partial Ceasefire is Absolutely Not Capitulation or Compromise</p>
<p>Recognition of the Puppet State is Entirely the Fabrication of Enemy Traitors</p>
<p>The People of the Nation Should Still Endure Hardships and Resist Long-Term</p>
<p>Those Who Disrupt Local Areas and Resist the Central Government Should Be Severely Punished</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, since news of a ceasefire in the north has spread, the fighting near Tianjin and Beijing remains fierce. Negotiations are underway, but peace is not easily achieved. Various parties are speculating, and the truth is unknown. Rumors are even more rampant in this port, and the atmosphere has become tense. Yesterday, a reporter specifically visited Mayor Wu, who provided a detailed statement regarding the current situation. (The following is Mayor Wu's statement:)</p>
<h3>The National Crisis is Severe</h3>
<p>At this time, the entire nation should be of one heart and one mind, securing the interior and resisting external aggression. Since the September 18th Incident, the central government has always adhered to the determination to resist on one hand and negotiate on the other, with absolutely no intention of submitting to violence and signing a humiliating treaty that would betray the nation. When Rehe and Yu fell into crisis, the central government mobilized troops to the north to resist the Japanese. The heroic sacrifices along the Great Wall were witnessed by all. At the same time, the Red bandits in Jiangxi Province have been harassing the area for years, and their combined encirclement and suppression do not allow for the slightest relaxation. The central government is simultaneously planning and considering all aspects, which takes painstaking effort. Compared to merely chanting slogans, the difficulty cannot be measured. This time, Huang Yingbai was ordered to go north to form a Political Affairs Reorganization Committee. This happened to coincide with a slight setback in the military situation at the front.</p>
<h3>The Trend of Events</h3>
<p>There was a move by an envoy to mediate and conduct ceasefire negotiations. Huang faced these perilous times, upholding the central government's principles and mediating. The only goal was to preserve Tianjin and Beijing and allow the refugees to catch their breath. However, the fundamental points of contention between China and Japan, namely the issues of the three northeastern provinces and Rehe, must still be addressed through international conventions. The responsibility of the Chinese people to resist long-term is still not allowed to slacken. What I dare to assert is that the central government will never enter into a treaty of surrender, destroying the nation's foundation by recognizing the so-called "Manchukuo." It must be known that since our country is a member of the League of Nations and has also signed the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, the central government has repeatedly stated that it accepts the resolutions of the League of Nations. How could it first recognize "Manchukuo" while the international community does not recognize the principle, thus isolating itself from the League of Nations? Even women and children know that this is absolutely impossible. It is clearly a deliberate fabrication by the Japanese, with internal traitors following suit and inciting trouble. All those who genuinely love the country and the nation will certainly not fall for their trick and cause internal strife. There are two things that I would like to announce to all citizens of Shanghai through the newspapers: (1) The central government,</p>
<h3>Assessing the Overall Situation and Weighing the Circumstances, Accepts the</h3>
<p>The ceasefire negotiation, the pain of which need not be stated. Therefore, even if a partial ceasefire is achieved, the people of the nation should learn from the pain and continue to strive for the long term. It must be known that a ceasefire is merely a cessation of military action in a certain period and a certain area. It is neither surrender nor abandonment of resistance. The citizens of Shanghai should still endure hardships and strive to wipe out the humiliation. There should be no complacency or short-sightedness, only knowing how to compete for petty profits and abandoning the determination to resist long-term. Otherwise, the poison of chronic national subjugation will become incurable. (2) The lack of organization and unity in our country has always been ridiculed by the Japanese. Regardless of whether the</p>
<h3>Partial Ceasefire in the North Becomes a Reality,</h3>
<p>Even in the case of a de facto ceasefire that does not involve political conditions, our people should deeply understand the central government's painstaking efforts and never strongly assert that the ceasefire is surrender or compromise, using it as an excuse to attack the central government, or even extending the rumors spread by the Japanese, falsely accusing the central government of accepting humiliating conditions, and listing future "major disasters" to criticize the central government. For example, the southwest region has only paid lip service to resisting Japan, without ever sending troops north to reinforce, and has spoken highly of suppressing the Red bandits, without ever dispatching troops to encircle and suppress them. Instead, they have stirred up the emotions of anti-Japanese soldiers and discouraged the courage of soldiers suppressing the Red bandits. Recently, they have again picked up rumors, insinuating and slandering that the central government will recognize "Manchukuo," even sending telegrams to the League of Nations and the countries that signed the Nine-Power Treaty,</p>
<h3>Exposing Division is Painful for Loved Ones and Gratifying for Enemies.</h3>
<p>Quickly, therefore, elements of the State First faction have been actively active in the north and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. In Tianjin and Beijing, they have colluded with frustrated warlords and politicians, such as Zhang Jingyao, Sun Chuanfang, Qi Xieyuan, and Wu Jinglian, plotting in secret to create a new northern regime under the protection of the enemy. In Shanghai, they have united various reactionary factions, vainly attempting to incite strikes and market closures, disrupting local order and creating a terrifying situation, as a pretext for seizing power. Secretly, they are even willing to collude with communists, preparing for riots, leading to the advocacy that the central government should not suppress the Red bandits, or should not suppress the Red bandits, or falsely claiming that the Red bandits can hand over the Red Army to resist Japan, in order to confuse the public and increase the bandit flames. All of this is</p>
<h3>Insane and Unreasonable. Shanghai</h3>
<p>Citizens must know that Shanghai is the lifeline of the nation's finances, and the success or failure of resisting Japan and suppressing the Red bandits is inextricably linked to the governance of Shanghai. After the January 28th Incident, the citizens of Shanghai should learn from the pain, bury their heads in hard work, cultivate the nation's vitality, enhance the nation's strength, and engage in practical work to resist Japan and save the country. As for those who only chant slogans and intentionally disrupt the internal traitors, not only should they not be deceived, but they should also work together to eliminate them. Only then can the interior be secure and the exterior be defended, and the day will eventually come when the nation's great humiliation is washed away.</p>
<p>In short, since I am a member of the Central Committee and also the local official of this city, my only responsibility is to uphold the central government's aim of securing the interior and resisting external aggression without wavering, and to do my best to stabilize local order, unite the will of the citizens, and cultivate the nation's wealth. In this time of internal and external pressures, with hundreds of holes and thousands of sores, if anyone disregards the interests of the nation and the country, harboring the intention to incite and spread rumors everywhere, hoping to disrupt the local area and resist the central government, it is my duty to severely punish them in order to curb the chaos. I hope that all citizens will work hard together to maintain public order. It would be fortunate for the local area, and fortunate for the country.</p>
<h3>Factory Inspection Issue</h3>
<p>Yu Hongjun and Fei Xindun to Confer This Afternoon</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of inspecting factories in the concession, Mayor Wu went to the capital the other day and discussed and decided with the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Industry that the municipal government would be responsible for discussing cooperation methods with the public concession authorities. It is learned that Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, is scheduled to visit Fei Xindun, Director-General of the Public Concession, this afternoon at 2:00 PM to begin discussing cooperation methods. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Principles for Today's Consultation</h3>
<p>A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Fei Xindun at the Public Works Department yesterday to inquire about the concession</p>
<p>Factory inspection issue. According to him, Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, has scheduled to visit</p>
<p>Me tomorrow (i.e., today) afternoon to discuss various issues related to the concession and the urban area. The issue of factory inspection in the concession will be discussed and decided, but it is expected that the issue cannot be resolved in the short term. What will be discussed with Yu tomorrow is only a principle. After the principle is decided, detailed solutions can be continued.</p>
<h3>Envoy's Reply Not Yet Received</h3>
<p>According to Burton Sayer, Director of the Information Department of the Public Works Department, to a reporter from the Central News Agency, Yu and Fei have had</p>
<p>informal meetings on the issue of factory inspection in the concession between the Municipal Government and the Public Works Department, but no progress has been made. The reason is that since the Consular Body submitted the revised Yangjingbang Regulations appendix law to the Diplomatic Corps, no reply has been received. It is expected that after two weeks, the reply will be received, and then it can be proceeded with accordingly.</p>
<h3>Fei's Compromise Solution</h3>
<p>According to Xinsheng News Agency, after repeated consultations between the Public Works Department and the Municipal Government, Fei Xindun, Director-General of the Public Works Department,</p>
<p>presented opinions to our side in a private advisory capacity. The general idea is that he suggests that the factory inspection method in the concession can be modeled after the method for collecting stamp tax and the method for collecting unified tobacco tax in the concession, establishing an inspection office that is of a committee nature, with officials from both Chinese and concession authorities executing it. This method can</p>
<p>be regarded as an informal compromise opinion expressed by the Public Works Department accepting the inspection. Yu Hongjun, our representative, aside from promising to reply after consideration, has telegraphed the Ministry of Industry to solicit opinions.</p>
<h3>Main Points of the Ministry of Industry's Reply</h3>
<p>According to what has been heard from the Ministry of Industry, after receiving Yu's report, a reply was immediately sent, which reportedly indicated that this kind of</p>
<p>Compromise solution is still feasible, but it is believed that the organization of the inspection office should be dominated by Chinese government personnel, and the Chinese side should have more participation in the personnel. What is particularly emphasized is that the power of punishment for any improprieties found in the inspection should belong to the Shanghai Special District Court. As for whether the various procedures for stamp tax and unified tobacco tax can be handled in the same way as factory inspection, it is currently under study. Generally speaking, the current situation of consultation has a promising outlook for mutual understanding and a form of resolution. As for the detailed implementation of the inspection method, wait for this</p>
<h3>New Silver Coin Model Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Central Mint to Start Using New Coins Next Week, to be Circulated in the Market in Early June</p>
<h3>Review Committee Scheduled to be Established Today</h3>
<p>The new silver coin model for the Central Mint arrived in Shanghai yesterday, and the Review Committee is scheduled to be formally established today to facilitate the new</p>
<p>After the coins are inspected, they will be circulated in the market as soon as possible. Details are explored and recorded below.</p>
<h3>New Coin Model Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The original silver coin model for the Central Mint had Sun Yat-sen's portrait on the front and a sailboat on the back</p>
<p>, with three birds flying above the sailboat and a rising sun in the background. Later, the Ministry of Finance decided to cancel the rising sun because it was easily misunderstood, and commissioned the casting of a new model in the United States. It is learned that this new model arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, and the Central Mint is currently cleaning it and has decided to start using this new model to mint new coins starting next week.</p>
<h3>Review Committee Established Today</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance previously hired Kong Xiangxi, Xu Kan, Lu Xuepu, Chen Xing, Xi Demao, Hu Mengjia, Ye Zhuo</p>
<p>Tang, Zhang Gongquan, Bei Songsun, Tang Shou, Hu Bijiang, Chen Zhaqing, Li Fusun, Qian Xinzhi, Xu Jilun, Xu Xinliu, Chen Guangfu, Xie Taofu, Qin Runqing, Wu Yunzhai, Ye Fuxiao, Hu Yunzhuang, Jian Dongpu, Hao Shumin, Lei Shengbo, Ma Su, Lin Shu, Ma Xier, Tai Wei, Lai Aisi, Mina, Shibi Men, Geng Aide, Mai Kai, Shi Huang, Shi Demen, Dai Jingfu, etc., as members of the New Coin Review Committee of the Central Mint, and designated Kong Xiangxi as the chairman to review the fineness, weight, and tolerance of the new coins. The committee is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting at 4:00 PM today at the Central Mint, so that the new coins can be circulated in the market as soon as possible after inspection.</p>
<h3>To be Circulated in the Market in Early June</h3>
<p>The new coins previously issued by the Central Mint have all been sent to the Central Bank for use as reserves.</p>
<p>According to Wei Jingzhou, Deputy Director of the factory, to a reporter from the Central News Agency, the new model is scheduled to be applied starting next Monday. After that, the new coins issued will be reviewed by the Review Committee before they can be circulated in the market. It is expected that the new coins will be able to circulate in the market in early June. The factory's highest record for daily coin output in the past was 200,000 yuan. After the new model is applied, production will be maximized, and it is hoped that the new record of 200,000 yuan can be broken.</p>
<p>After the principle is decided, further consultations will be held. It is also reported that the Public Works Department will soon</p>
<p>will submit a memorandum-like summary to our side, the content of which will include the six principles for factory inspection agreed upon by the International Labour Organization of the Ministry of Industry and the Public Works Department, as well as the Public Works Department's own opinions, as a concrete expression of the Public Works Department's views on this issue.</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Financial Balance Difficult to Achieve</h3>
<p>This year's deficit will reach 2 million yuan due to post-war impact</p>
<p>Shanghai's finances have always been abundant. Since the January 28th Incident, however, revenue has decreased sharply, and expenditures have increased, making it difficult to achieve balance. A reporter from the Central News Agency specifically visited Shen Tongzi, the third section chief of the Municipal Finance Bureau, who told him the following:</p>
<h3>No Way to Make Up Yet According to Shen,</h3>
<p>Since the January 28th Incident, Shanghai's finances have been greatly affected. Tax revenues such as house rent and land tax have decreased sharply, while expenditures have had to be increased due to the needs of the environment. It is estimated that Shanghai's finances will be in deficit by 2 million yuan this year. However, all non-urgent matters have been postponed, and expenses have been minimized. As for how to make up for this large amount of deficit, it is really difficult to tell for the moment.</p>
<h3>Land Tax Collection Indefinite Shen also said that the Bureau</h3>
<p>originally planned to start collecting various new taxes within this year, such as land value tax and business tax, to supplement income. However, the business tax has made little progress due to the concession. Although the Municipal Chamber of Commerce was previously asked to assist, no results have been seen. As for the land value tax, although it is being actively handled, the original method of collection in Shanghai is slightly different from the central government's regulations. It has been revised and submitted to the central government for approval, but no reply has been received yet. Therefore, it is not yet possible to know when this tax can be collected.</p>
<h3>Price Reduction for Two Railways</h3>
<p>Reduced by 50%, Effective June 1st</p>
<p>For less-than-carload shipments on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, the Beijing-Shanghai line has been charging 100% of the full carload rate, and the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo line has been charging 75% of the full carload rate. It is now learned that the two railway administrations, in order to ease the difficulties of merchants and facilitate the circulation of less-than-carload goods from various places, have submitted a request to the Ministry of Railways for approval to uniformly change the less-than-carload freight rate to 50% of the full carload rate, and will implement it starting on June 1st.</p>
<h3>Unemployed Westerners in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Including White Russians, About a Thousand People</p>
<p>According to the Great American Evening Post, according to news from the Salvation Army Employment Agency and the Shanghai YMCA Employment Agency, there are more than 700 unemployed Westerners in Shanghai, and that does not include White Russians. Among them, about 450 are men and 270 are women. The main reason for their unemployment is the decline in Far East commerce, but there are also many who have heard about the prosperity of Shanghai in Europe and America and have come to seek a place to live. The skills of these unemployed people are mostly in office work, but there are also specialists in architecture, accounting, pharmacy, and engineering. They come from more than 40 countries, with the British, Americans, and Germans accounting for the majority. As for the number of unemployed White Russians, according to the chairman of the Russian Immigrant Committee, there are about 300 to 400 men and about 100 women.</p>
<h3>Kailuan Bureau Denies Closure</h3>
<p>According to the Mainland News, personnel from the Kailuan Mining Bureau in Shanghai denied that the mine was forced to close due to the Japanese invasion of North China, and said that the current inventory in Shanghai is still sufficient for one month's needs. Local coal merchants in Shanghai are still purchasing Kailuan coal as before.</p>
<h3>Banking Industry Establishes Rural Adjustment Committee</h3>
<p>Zhang Gongquan and Others Appointed as Committee Members</p>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Association, based on the letter from the Rural Reconstruction Committee requesting the establishment of a rural economic adjustment committee, convened the third executive committee meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday. Over twenty people attended, including Zhang Gongquan, Li Ming, Xu Jilun, Lin Kanghou, Wu Daquan, Song Ziliang, and Wu Yunzhai. The meeting was chaired by Li Fusun, the chairman of the committee, and recorded by Gu Cheng'an, the secretary. After the report items were completed, the eleven articles were discussed one by one in order of the meeting schedule, but none were published. As for the letter from the Rural Reconstruction Association, it was decided to organize a "Rural Adjustment Committee," with 21 members. In addition to the ten committee members participating in the Rural Reconstruction Committee, Zhang Gongquan, Li Fusun, Wu Daquan, Zhou Zuomin, Qian Xinzhi, Chen Guangfu, Xu Xinliu, Hu Bijiang, Tang Shoumin, and Wang Zhixin, Xu Jilun, Ye Fuxiao, Wu Yunzhai, Zhu Ziliang, Qi Yunqing, Xu Boming, Wang Boyuan, Hu Xixian, Sun Jingxi, and Liu Huizhi were added as committee members. Li Fusun was appointed as the convener, and the date of the first meeting was determined by the convener. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Our Country Will Levy Anti-Dumping Duties</h3>
<p>England and the United States, Similarly Affected, Have Begun Studying Solutions, While Japan is Seeking Countermeasures</p>
<p>According to the Kuo Wen News Agency, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, concerned that foreign goods are being dumped into our country, greatly affecting our economy and the people's livelihood, promulgated regulations on anti-dumping duties in the 20th year of the Republic (1931). However, because the detailed rules remained under study, they were never implemented. Now, further research is being conducted, and anti-dumping duties will be levied when preparations are complete. A reporter learned from various sources yesterday that European and American countries are similarly affected and are also studying ways to curb dumping. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Our Country's Actions</h3>
<p>Our country's measures to curb the dumping of foreign goods were promulgated in the 20th year of the Republic (1931), but the implementing rules are yet to be determined. It is reported that the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry will discuss the measures within days, based on the regulations promulgated in 1931 and referring to the methods of European and American countries to ensure their suitability. Furthermore, the Directors of the Customs and Taxation Departments of the Ministry of Finance will, together with the Directors of the Commerce, Agriculture and Industry Departments of the Ministry of Industry, and relevant agencies, form a review committee to define the types and</p>
<p>nature of dumped goods for implementation.</p>
<h3>Japanese Attention</h3>
<p>Our country is a market for the commercial battles of various countries, and Japanese goods in particular occupy a significant advantage, due to the convenience of transportation, cheap raw materials, and the benefits of favorable tariff rates under the Sino-Japanese tariff reciprocity agreement before its expiration. The dumping of Japanese goods in our country is substantial. Since the news that our country's Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Industry will levy anti-dumping duties became known to the Japanese, they have been paying close attention. The Japanese government, the public, and Japanese merchants in China have been actively seeking countermeasures.</p>
<h3>Europe and America Also Affected</h3>
<p>England, India, Egypt, Persia, and the United States also have many agreements with Japan</p>
<p>regarding tariff reciprocity, with preferential treatment of mutually reduced tariff rates. However, recently, England and the United States have noticed that Japanese goods are being dumped by taking advantage of tariff reciprocity, greatly affecting British and American goods. Therefore, they have also begun studying solutions, planning to formulate plans to levy anti-dumping duties. On the one hand, they will maintain reciprocity agreements to obtain balanced tariff rates and avoid losses from dumping. The Japanese, upon hearing this news, have been paying attention to this issue along with the problem in our country.</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchants Discuss New Chinese Tariffs</h3>
<p>The Japanese Chamber of Commerce in this city held a general meeting of Japanese merchant representatives in Shanghai at the Japanese Club on Wenjian Shi Road at 6 PM yesterday because our country's newly established national tariff schedule took effect on the 22nd of this month. The import tax on imported Japanese goods, such as cotton cloth and fish, has increased by two to three times compared to the past, which has a significant impact on trade with China. More than 30 people attended to discuss countermeasures. The Japanese Chamber of Commerce plans to submit the following proposals for discussion: (1) Actively establish Japanese-owned factories in Shanghai; (2) Telegraph the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with the Chinese government and demand the modification of the implemented national tariff schedule; (3) How to raise the prices of Japanese goods to avoid excessive losses. There were more than a dozen other proposals from Japanese merchants. The discussion lasted until after 8 PM and the meeting had not yet adjourned.</p>
<h3>Tea Merchants Request Loans for Relief as Hua Tea Exports to Russia Stagnate</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry Has Requested the Ministry of Finance to Verify</p>
<p>Hua tea exports to Russia are sluggish. Previously, tea merchants sent representatives to the International Trade Bureau to request solutions. They also petitioned the Ministry of Industry to designate state-owned banks to provide discounted interest loans and cash advances. At the same time, the International Trade Bureau also submitted the tea merchants' requests to the Ministry for instructions. The Bureau has now received Instruction No. 17806 Shang from the Ministry of Industry, stating, "The presentation has been noted. This case was previously presented by the Hankou Tea Export Industry Association. The section regarding the designation of state-owned banks for discounted interest loans and cash advances has been sent to the Ministry of Finance for verification. Now, after reviewing the Bureau's response and suggestions, the key issue remains the loan relief, which concerns finance and banking. In addition to sending it to the Ministry of Finance for joint verification, you are hereby informed."</p>
<h3>Trademark Bureau Notice on Collecting Documents for Registration Applications</h3>
<p>The Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Industry issued a notice yesterday regarding the collection of documents for registration applications: "Notice is hereby given that Ministry of Industry Instruction No. 17656 Shang states, 'Company registration is crucial to the legal interests of merchants. For the convenience of merchants in various regions, henceforth, companies applying for establishment registration may have the Bureau collect the application documents and forward them to the Ministry. The Ministry will then order the local competent authorities to review and register the company, and issue a license to facilitate the process. Three provisional measures are attached for compliance.' Accordingly, the Bureau hereby transcribes the three provisional measures issued by the Ministry for general knowledge and will, from this date, collect all fees for company establishment registration applications in accordance with the regulations. Special notice is hereby given." Attached: Provisional measures for the receipt of company establishment registration documents by the Ministry of Industry and the Trademark Bureau of this Ministry: (1) For the sake of convenience, companies applying for establishment registration may submit them directly to the Ministry or send them to the Trademark Bureau of this Ministry for collection and forwarding to the Ministry. (2) Upon receiving the above documents, the Ministry will still order them to be sent to the local competent authorities for review. However, if a problem occurs in the company's location and the competent authority cannot exercise its functions according to law, the Ministry may temporarily handle it directly. (3) The office expenses stipulated in Article 16 of the Company Registration Rules will be issued by the Ministry to the local competent authorities along with the approval of registration. However, if handled in accordance with the provisions of the proviso in the preceding article, they may be transferred to the receiving agency as office expenses.</p>
<h3>Antique Unloading Completed Yesterday Morning, Public Exhibition Temporarily Difficult to Realize</h3>
<p>The fifth batch of antiques, which arrived in Shanghai on the Guangli Wheel the other day, was unloaded by workers immediately upon arrival. The unloading has now been completed, and the antiques are stored in warehouses at No. 26 Tianzhutang Street and No. 32 Sichuan Road. Yu Tongkui, Chief of the General Affairs Department of the Palace Museum, told the Central News Agency reporter yesterday morning that all the antiques from the Peiping Palace Museum have been transported to Shanghai for safekeeping. The local antique storage authorities had previously proposed to open a room in the storage area to exhibit the arrived antiques in batches. However, due to the continuous arrival of large quantities of antiques, the storage area is piled high, making exhibitions inconvenient. Therefore, it was temporarily suspended. Currently, there are still many requests from all walks of life for a public exhibition, but there is no suitable address to display them. Public exhibition of precious antiques must have adequate protection, funding, and manpower, which must be planned in advance. Therefore, the matter of public exhibition has been submitted to the central government for instructions. Once approved, preparations will be made. President Yi will go to Peiping in the coming days, and I myself must return to Peiping via Nanking.</p>
<h3>Two Customs Notices</h3>
<p>Fishing Vessels Must Obtain Licenses from the Ministry of Industry, He'an Steamer Taken Over by Customs</p>
<p>Tang Haian, Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, and Tax Commissioner Burkhardt issued two notices yesterday, which are recorded separately below: (1) Notice No. 1301 regarding joint issuance of notice. It has been ordered by the government that henceforth, any vessel operating with machinery shall not be allowed to operate as a fishing vessel unless it has a fishing license from the Ministry of Industry. However, this measure will not apply to ordinary fishing boats that do not operate with machinery. Be informed accordingly. Special notice is hereby given. (2) Notice No. 1302 regarding notice. The sinking of the He'an steamer in the New Channel was previously announced by the harbor master of this Customs on May 20 of this year. It has now been found that the owner of the sunken ship has abandoned all rights, and the ship has been voluntarily abandoned. Therefore, it has now been taken over by the Customs. If anyone is privately selling the sunken ship or goods inside, do not believe them lightly and be deceived. Salvage of this sunken ship is strictly prohibited without the permission of this Tax Commissioner. Special notice is hereby given.</p>
<h3>Xiong Xiling Went to Hangzhou Yesterday Morning to Provide Relief to Refugees in North China</h3>
<p>Xiong Xiling, President of the Chinese Red Swastika Society, arrived in Shanghai from Peiping and immediately planned with all sectors of this city for the expense of relieving refugees in North China. He has achieved considerable results. Therefore, Mr. Xiong took a train to Hangzhou yesterday morning to contact people in various sectors there and will return to Shanghai in about six or seven days to head north.</p>
<h3>Red Swastika Society Relief Commissioner Reports Tragic Situation of Disaster in Shaanxi</h3>
<p>The World Red Swastika Society, considering the severe disaster situation in Shaanxi, allocated 20,000 yuan and publicly appointed Li Zhizhen and Wang Zhengui to go to Shaanxi for relief. Later, because the disaster situation was tragic and the relief funds were insufficient, the Southeast Office of the Society in Shanghai allocated another 10,000 yuan and remitted it directly to Xi'an. Now it is heard that the Society has recently received a report from the Relief Commissioner on the disaster situation, which is unbearable to read. The urgency for relief can be seen. The following is a record of the report: "We arrived in Xi'an on the 9th and rested briefly. On the 13th, we set out with Mr. Kou Huaxing and Mr. Pei Huadao of the Xi'an Branch, along with six team members and two porters, to investigate the Xingping Qilang area on the west road. We plan to first handle Qian and Li counties, with a standard of 3,000 yuan per county, and extra funding for particularly severely affected areas, focusing on those who cannot survive without relief. The area within the provincial capital has not yet been counted. Although there have been slight rains in the past month, the streets and alleys are still filled with disaster victims, especially boys and old women. Every evening, the sound of begging for food is like the mournful cry of a flock of geese. When we get up in the morning, we see the eaves and doorways with people huddled together, embracing their knees, leaning on each other for warmth, and sleeping. The number cannot be counted. As the weather gets hotter, dozens of people die every day. The tragedy is unbearable to witness. However, Heaven is not merciful. Recently, Pu, Lin, and Wei counties have been hit by black frost, followed by strong winds that have dried up the remaining wheat seedlings. The severity of the disaster in the future is even more unimaginable. We sincerely hope that benevolent people will provide relief as soon as possible."</p>
<h3>Suspension of Export Subsidies for Raw Silk</h3>
<p>Ordered to Stop at the End of This Month, Both Committees to be Concluded Simultaneously</p>
<p>The governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, in order to rescue the silk industry, issued 3 million yuan of short-term public bonds for the Jiangsu-Zhejiang silk industry in the 21st year of the Republic (1932) and established two committees: the Committee for Organizing Chenchang Silk and Chencocoon and the Committee for Promoting Chensilk. It was decided to conclude at the end of this month. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Conclusion of Both Committees</h3>
<p>The total amount of short-term public bonds for the Jiangsu-Zhejiang silk industry in the 21st year of the Republic (1932) was 3 million yuan. The principal has been repaid in two lotteries, on December 31 of last year and March 31 of this year. The third lottery for principal repayment is scheduled for the 31st of next month. The Committee for Organizing Chenchang Silk and Chencocoon and the Committee for Promoting Chensilk were established to handle registration and promotion matters. When registered and qualified Chensilk was exported, the fund management committee issued a subsidy of 140 yuan per dan. The original deadline was December 31 of last year, but it was approved for a three-month extension, until May 31 of this year. It has now been ordered to end on schedule, and the two committees have begun to handle the conclusion.</p>
<h3>Subsidy Suspension</h3>
<p>Of the 3 million yuan in public bonds, except for 200,000 yuan for organization and promotion expenses, the net amount was 2.8 million yuan. Calculated at 140 yuan per dan, this amounts to 20,000 dan. As of the end of April, the exported Chensilk has reached 17,000 dan. Silk merchants are trying to sell because the subsidy will be suspended soon, and foreign firms are taking the opportunity to lower prices. Silk merchants, in order to obtain subsidies, are still selling. The price of B-grade silk has fallen from 700 yuan per dan to 600 yuan per dan. Since the beginning of this month, the weekly export of silk has reached 600-700 dan. Up until last Saturday, the exported silk has reached more than 19,000 dan. There are still two ships scheduled to go to Europe and the United States this month, one from the Flag Company on the 27th and one from the British Company on the 30th. The silk to be exported will be approximately more than 1,000 dan. As for the factory silk currently in this city, there are only more than 3,000 dan.</p>
<h3>Jiang Cables to Stop Sichuan War, Liu Xiang Complies with Order to Persuade for Peace</h3>
<p>During the serious external threat, the Deng and Liu armies of Sichuan Province killed each other. Chairman Jiang telegraphed Liu Xiang, instructing him to stop the war in the name of righteousness. Liu Xiang has telegraphed Deng and Liu again to immediately cease hostilities. Liu Xiang sent a telegram to Shanghai yesterday reporting the progress. The original telegram is recorded below: "To Brothers Deng Mingjie and Chuan Zhenwu: I have just sent another telegram to Commander Liu in Chengdu and Commander Deng in Hanzhou, saying, 'My previous telegram advised for peace, and I hoped that you would observe. However, according to reports, the war zone has spread and expanded. I was about to telegraph again to inform you, but I received a telegram from Commander-in-Chief Jiang, who said, 'In recent days, I have repeatedly received telegrams from various parties in Sichuan, since the Gan, Jin, and Kang armies have already provoked conflict and war. At present, North China is under threat from bandits, Tianjin and Peiping are shaken, and the remnants of red bandits in Sichuan and Jiangxi are still fierce. At this time when the country's survival is at stake, if you disregard everything and start an internal struggle, killing each other, how can you seek understanding from the people of the country? I am heartbroken to hear this. I have earnestly telegraphed Jin and the two others, ordering them to return to their original defenses. I hope you will use righteousness to instruct them nearby and quickly correct them and try to eliminate the conflict. This will not only benefit the country, but also bring peace to Sichuan. I rely on you. Please telegraph the situation of the cessation of hostilities and all parties at any time, etc.'" "I believe that the national crisis is urgent and the people's suffering is deep. It is already too late to save the situation together, but instead, you wield the weapons of brothers during the busy farming season, even destroying dams and embankments in an attempt to prevail, causing suffering to the people and resentment. When the bad news came, my heart ached. The central government's blame is increasing, and the local area is in a state of disarray. What will be the outcome of this prolonged conflict? The two of you have always been patriotic and caring for your hometowns. I urge you to follow the central government's orders, immediately cease hostilities, and wait for resolution. If you still persist and act willfully, you will not only cut yourselves off from the masses, but also be ridiculed by foreign countries. I, Xiang, am duty-bound and dare not be negligent, disregarding the local people. I earnestly plead, hoping for your consideration, and await your instructions, etc., Liu Xiang respectfully said,' and I have telegraphed all the generals in Sichuan to unanimously persuade for peace and immediately cease hostilities. Special delivery, please take note, Liu Xiang respectfully said.'"</p>
<h3>Shenxin No. 1 Factory Reduces Bonus, Causing Disputes Among Workers</h3>
<p>Party and Government Representatives Thoroughly Investigate and Schedule Mediation</p>
<p>Shenxin Yarn Factory No. 1 in Zhoujiaqiao announced on the 1st of this month that due to operating losses, it would reduce the bonus originally set for workers who did not miss work for two days each month. The workers strongly opposed it, arguing that the workers had never benefited from the factory's profits over the years. Now, due to the impact of the situation, the business has slightly declined, and they want to reduce their salaries. The labor union has repeatedly requested the capitalists to maintain the status quo, but to no avail. The Cotton Textile Industry Union of the Tenth District sent representatives Fan Luquan, Zhuang Guanyong, Cao Asi, Sun Shouxiang, and others to the Party and government authorities yesterday morning to petition, requesting that the capitalists be ordered to maintain the original state to avoid serious disputes. They first went to the Municipal Party Department, where they were received by Lu Yin-chu, a staff member of the Civil Training Section, who agreed to handle it jointly with the Social Affairs Bureau. Then they went to the Social Affairs Bureau, where they were received by Wang Keqing, a staff member of the Third Section, who believed that the matter was serious. They sent mediator Zhu Jintao to conduct a thorough investigation with Lu Yin-chu of the Municipal Party Department, and scheduled another mediation.</p>
<h3>Tianzhang's Reduced Labor Goes Smoothly, Labor and Management Have Agreed to Cooperate in Competing with the Dumping of Foreign Paper</h3>
<p>Liu Keqin, associate manager of the Huashang Tianzhang Paper Mill, said that Tianzhang produces no less than 20 or 30 kinds of imported paper, including Daolin, art paper, book covers, etc. The materials are carefully researched and can compete with imported products. Therefore, all parties are happy to adopt them. The total annual paper production is worth about 2 million yuan. Since the dumping of Eastern and Western paper goods in China in recent years, the prices of all kinds of foreign paper on the market have fallen by 30% to 40%, and even by half. In particular, the planned dumping of Japanese paper has greatly affected the domestic foreign paper industry. In order to take care of consumers' willingness to use domestic goods, Tianzhang does not hesitate to reduce prices and compete vigorously, which has been going on for more than two years. In addition, the global recession has become increasingly severe, and various foreign goods are being dumped into China fiercely. Foreign paper is certainly no exception. Various domestic textile factories have already taken measures to reduce manpower, in order to concentrate their efforts to compete with foreign goods. Our factory is preparing for a long-term struggle, and must strive to economize on various expenses. Therefore, we submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau for permission to reduce wages appropriately, so that the factory can better exert its strength to deal with foreign countries in a consistent manner. The Social Affairs Bureau convened labor and management for questioning the day before yesterday (23rd), and the results were quite good. Because the labor side was able to deeply understand the factory's difficulties, it agreed to negotiate a reduction in labor. What I just heard about the external rumors is a misrepresentation of those who do not know the truth. An announcement has been published in the newspaper to solemnly clarify and correct it.</p>
<h3>Northeast Refugee Association's Emergency Fundraising</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Charitable Organizations United Relief Association for Northeast Refugees, being greatly concerned about the increasing number of Northeast refugees, specially telegraphed the Peiping-Tianjin Office to inquire about the work situation. It also published advertisements requesting contributions from all walks of life. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<h3>Emergency Fundraising</h3>
<p>The Association issued an emergency fundraising announcement because refugees are gathering in Peiping and Tianjin, and relief is urgently needed. "The Association received a report that the war zone is pressing, and refugees from all over the world, supporting the old and carrying the young, have gathered in Peiping and Tianjin, exceeding 200,000 people. They are starving and freezing, sleeping in the open air, without food or shelter, and wandering everywhere. The situation is too horrible to describe. If relief is not raised quickly, they will all fill the ditches. Therefore, we are publishing this appeal, respectfully requesting all sectors of the country to uphold the righteousness of the '披髮纓冠' and to make plans for helping the injured and saving the dying. We hope you will generously donate your love and compassion to help those in urgent need. The Association pledges to embody kindness and compassion, using every drop to relieve refugees and bring them practical benefits. We earnestly plead for your public consideration."</p>
<h3>Telegram for Relief Work</h3>
<p>"To Mr. Qu Wenliu and Mr. Feng Yangshan in Tianjin: I acknowledge receipt of your telegram. The medicines for relief are approved to be transported to Tianjin immediately. According to reports, there are more than 200,000 refugees in Peiping and Tianjin. The Cili Society is rushing to set up shelters to accommodate them. However, please telegraph whether the Cili Society is actually our Association. Please telegraph the situation of your work in the future every day, so that it will be easier to persuade people to donate. This is what we hope and pray for. Shanghai Charitable Organizations United Relief Association for Northeast Refugees."</p>
<h3>Unable to Bury</h3>
<p>The Association previously approved the Peiping-Tianjin Office's telegram requesting methods for burying corpses. It immediately forwarded a letter to the Pushan Villa to organize a burial team, which has already traveled north from Shanghai on the Yihua Company's Lisheng steamer a few days ago. It also telegraphed Qu Wenliu and Feng Yangshan to receive them. A reply telegram has now been received, stating: "The burial work cannot be carried out at present. It is planned to order the original ship to return to Shanghai. The medicines for relief should be transported to Tianjin. The refugees gathered after retreating to Tianjin. This office will temporarily move to Tianjin, Qu Yingguang and Feng Yangshan respectfully said."</p>
<h3>16 Disraeli Road</h3>
<p>A Red Pill Manufacturing Operation is Raided, Over Three Hundred Jin of Red Pills Seized, and Five Suspects Arrested</p>
<p>At about 1 PM yesterday, officers from the Public Concession Police Department were inspecting pedestrians along Disraeli Road when they noticed a young man carrying two large cloth bags, looking flustered and walking quickly. The officers ordered him to stop. They found the bags filled with red pills. They arrested him and took him to the police station. After a detailed interrogation by the police chief, the suspect identified himself as Yao Agen, 29 years old, from Changzhou, and confessed to trafficking red pills. He also revealed that the building at No. 16 Disraeli Lane in the Chinese territory of Disraeli Road was the manufacturing operation. Based on the confession, the police chief immediately dispatched a large number of officers at 2 PM, along with the suspect and the Fifth Precinct of the Public Security Bureau, to raid the operation. They arrested Qiu Huanxiang (30 years old, from Ningbo), Li Deqing (30 years old, from Nanhui), Dai Xingfa (18 years old, from Ningbo), Li Deming (36 years old, from Gaoyou), and Gu Ruiqi (24 years old, from Haimen). They seized pill-making machines and more than 300 jin of various types of red pills, both finished and unfinished. After interrogation, they confessed that the boss was named Wu Youzhang, who currently lives somewhere in the French Concession. Although the case was initiated by the police department, the operation was located in the Chinese territory, so a written report was submitted to the Judicial Section for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Weitai Plush Factory Established</h3>
<p>Grand Scale and High Quality Products</p>
<p>Chen Shengyou and other merchants from Ningbo, considering that there are few plush factories in our country, and in order to meet the needs of cotton and wool textile factories without brushing machines, specially organized the Weitai Plush Factory at No. 11 Xinle Lane, Nanyang Bridge, French Concession. They ordered five or six of the latest 36-roller, 90-inch wide brushing machines from famous British factories, specializing in brushing plush, such as flannel, camel hair, blankets, and cotton and wool textiles. Equipped with refining machines, rolling machines, and other equipment, delivery is fast and of high quality. They also have trucks to pick up and deliver goods for customers, making it the most complete plush factory in Shanghai. The telephone number is 84437.</p>

<h3>High Court Judges Come to Shanghai to Hear Li Guojie's Appeal Case</h3>
<h3>Yesterday's Interrogation Covered the Agreement Process and Facts, Today is a Rest, Tomorrow will be a Continued Hearing</h3>
<p>Li Guojie, General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, was accused of mortgaging the Fourth Wharf to the Chinese Business Company for 30 million, resulting in the loss of sovereignty and bribing supervisor Chen Fumu with 200,000 taels. The Ministry of Communications exposed the case and sent Li Guojie to the Shanghai District Court, which sentenced him to three years' imprisonment. Li was dissatisfied and appealed to the Jiangsu High Court. Because Li is ill in a Shanghai hospital, the Chief Judge Lin Zhezhang, judges Fang Wen and Si Wen, prosecutor Zhan Guifen, and clerk Li Wang of the High Court came to Shanghai to</p>
<h3>Organize a Temporary Court</h3>
<p>for the trial. Yesterday was the court date. At 1 PM, judicial police officer Chen Junfang, police chiefs Chen Xihui and Zhu Wenqing, etc., went to the Shanghai Hospital to escort Li to the court. After the Chief Judge took the stand, the court issued admission tickets to the audience, who entered in order. Because of the large number of people, four bailiffs maintained order in the court. The president of the court, Shen Xiqing, and the chief clerk, Wang Daozhou, etc., also inspected the court for a week. Then the bailiffs and the High Court's court attendants, etc.,</p>
<h3>Helped Li into Court</h3>
<p>His defense lawyers Zhang Yipeng, Sha Xunyi, Jiang Yiping, Wang Youling, etc., also arrived in court at the same time and stated that Li was ill and requested to be seated to make his statement. The judge allowed it. After the clerk read the case, the Chief Judge asked Li his age. Li replied, "52 years old, from Anhui, currently in Shanghai Hospital, former General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company." (Judge asked) "Li, you are charged with dereliction of duty and sentenced to two years' imprisonment, breach of trust and sentenced to two years' imprisonment, to be served concurrently for three years. Which part are you appealing?" (Li replied) "I am appealing against everything, because the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company signed a contract with the Chinese Business Company.</p>
<h3>It was the Supervisor's Order</h3>
<p>At that time, it was considered beneficial and harmless. The original judgment found me guilty, so I am dissatisfied. As for the 700,000, this is part of the loan, not separate wealth. How is it bribery? Giving it to the supervisor was for safekeeping." (Judge asked) "When was it approved?" (Li replied) "It was approved on September 3rd after receiving the supervisor's order." (Judge asked) "What was the loan for?" (Li replied) "Borrowing 10 million to build docks and warehouses, and buying 30 ships from the Dalai Steamer Company, totaling 20 million. These were assumed budgets. The conditions were reviewed by the supervisor." (Judge asked) "What about the interest?" (Li replied) "9% per annum. Is there compound interest?" (Li replied) "This is harmless to us.</p>
<h3>This is a Common Business Practice</h3>
<p>If it is not paid off by the due date, then of course there will be interest." (Judge asked) "Are there any other contents?" (Li replied) "Issuing bonds." (Judge asked) "How about the commission?" (Li replied) "2.5%. It is a business custom, taken by the intermediary, and I do not benefit from it at all. Therefore, it is a clear agreement." (Judge asked) "When did you take over?" Li replied, "The General Manager does not have independent power on April 12th, and everything is at the supervisor's command." (Judge asked) "How was it to be repaid after the contract was signed?" (Li replied) "300,000 per year, to be paid off in 20 years. It is expected that this building loan etc. can be paid off in three and a half years." (Judge asked) "Since the power is in the hands of others, how will it be handled in the future?" (Li replied) "To jointly organize a wharf company. Its rights should not be lost during the organization." (Judge asked) "How much should be given for the 30 ships?" (Li replied) "It cannot be predetermined. It must be known temporarily, because the tonnage in the North Sea, the South Sea, and the Yangtze River is different. We will calculate after the distribution."</p>
<h3>Estimated at Twenty Million</h3>
<p>However, in my opinion, it can be earned back in two or three years. (Question) Why does the contract state that the Dale Company is managing it? (Answer) This is because the ownership must wait until we have repaid the money before they return it to us. What the China Merchants Bureau needs are ships. By borrowing the ships and gradually paying them back, wouldn't we save on interest? (Question) Why is Dale required to guarantee?</p>
<h3>Public Prosecution Filed by Prosecutor in New Renhe Steamer Tragedy</h3>
<p>The case of the New Renhe Steamer crew conspiring to murder five people has been brought to the local court prosecutor's office by lawyer Wang Peiyuan, hired by the relatives of the deceased. After Prosecutor Zhang Zi completed the investigation, he filed a public prosecution according to the law yesterday. The original indictment is recorded below. Case No. 684 in the 22nd year of the Republic of China, concerning the crime of murder, etc., has been investigated and is deemed prosecutable. The criminal facts of the defendants, the reasons for prosecution, and the applicable criminal laws are listed below.</p>
<h3>Criminal Facts</h3>
<p>The defendants, Sun Xingsheng and others, are all employees of the New Renhe Steamer. Ma Kobao, Zhou Datong, Mei Laoer, Wei Jinfu, and Shen Xinliang were all small vendors operating on the ship. On the 12th of last month (i.e., the 18th day of the third lunar month), the ship set sail from Haimen to Shanghai. During the voyage, Ma Kobao and others stole more than 20 yuan in silver from passenger Wang Sanlang. When the incident came to light, they suspected that the sailor Huang Fusheng had pointed them out, leading to a quarrel. Huang Fusheng reported this to the shipowner Sun Xingsheng, who ordered the crew to tie up Ma Kobao and others in room 11. When the ship was near Lingdian Port, the five men struggled and loosened the ropes. Sun Xingsheng ordered them to be retied and dragged to platform C for flogging. Shen Xinliang struggled in pain and fell into the river. He was rescued by a boat, but he had already died. Seeing that the disaster had occurred, Sun Xingsheng conspired with Guo Xihou, Lu Yongqing, Wang Moqing, Zhu Shunlin, Chen Baosheng, and Wang Guanxian. They all said that it was better to kill them to prevent future trouble, and that dead men tell no tales. Fearing that there were too many crew members and the matter would not be kept secret, they agreed to a contract of "sharing blessings and sharing misfortunes." The contract was signed by all the employees of the ship. That evening, Sun Xingsheng and others incited Ma Xingfa, Shen Chuanlang, Shen Xingqiao, Wang Mingda, Liu Yongqing, Huang Fusheng, Zhang Xiaozhang, Wang Shouming, and Xiao Wang Mazi to take stones and tie them to the waists of Ma Kobao, Zhou Datong, Mei Laoer, Wei Jinfu, and Shen Xinliang, and throw them into the waters outside the Liuhe estuary, where they drowned. The relatives of the deceased, Ma Chen and others, did not see Ma Kobao and others return home and suspected something was wrong. They searched for them and heard that Ma Kobao and others had been murdered. They requested the water patrol team to send police to arrest the defendants at 00:30 on the 19th of last month. The contract and two authorizations were sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for handling.</p>
<h3>Reasons for Prosecution</h3>
<p>The reasons for prosecution are that Sun Jisheng, Guo Xihou, Lu Yongqing, Wang Moqing, Zhu Shunlin, Chen Baosheng, and Wang Guanxian jointly incited murder and abandonment of corpses, with the intent to evade punishment.

<p>X X X X</p>
<p>Recommend? (Answer) Recommendation is recommendation, but the power to employ people is ours. (Question) According to the contract, if the ownership, management rights, supervision rights, and the use of their American law are all there, then the China Merchants Bureau has completely nothing left? (Answer) This is because the money is borrowed from others and must be repaid, of course.</p>
<h3>Conditional Explanation</h3>
<p>(Question) How were 700,000 taels handed over to Chen Fumu? (Answer) He is the chief accountant of the China Merchants Bureau, and I have no independent authority. (Question) According to the supervisory regulations, he has no custody rights, only approval rights. The supervisory regulations state that the general manager must carry out the supervisor's orders and dare not disobey. (Question) None of the ten articles in the regulations state that the supervisor has custody rights. (Answer) He said it was temporary custody because there were many expenses. (Question) According to you, this money was handed over to Chen Fumu? (Answer) Yes. (Question) Such a huge sum of money, how could there be no receipt? (Answer) This was the order of my superior, which could not be disobeyed. How could I have foreseen this situation at the time? (Question) Before the prosecutor, you did not</p>
<h3>Mention Sparing No Expense</h3>
<p>To accomplish the great plan, and so on? (Answer) I'm afraid I didn't say that. However, it was copied from my report letter. (Question) Where did you hand over the money to Chen Fumu? (Answer) In the bureau. At that time, the supervisor sent Huang Jusu to take it. (Question) Was it a simultaneous exchange of receipt and money? (Answer) It had already been approved and issued. Dou Yaoting brought the money and was ordered to take it along the way. Before the incident, I was in Hankou inspecting the situation of the Yangtze River branch offices. Seeing that Minister Chen had been dismissed, I knew that I could not stay long. This is truly unexpected. By this point, it was already 4:30 in the afternoon. Therefore, it was announced that there would be a one-day break, and the examination and debate would resume on the afternoon of the 27th. The defendant was remanded.</p>
<h3>Elderly Couple in Their Declining Years Involved in Litigation</h3>
<h3>Wife Sues Husband for Neglecting Support, Demands Over 20,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Dai Huang, a woman from Nantong, is 51 years old. She married Xu Demo in the 27th year of the Guangxu reign during the Qing dynasty. Xu suddenly died within a few years, and she remarried to Dai Jikui with the arrangement of her aunt. The following year, she gave birth to a daughter named Zhiying. They lived together for more than ten years, and their feelings were very deep. Now that both Dai and his wife have reached their declining years, a rift has suddenly appeared. Dai Huang then hired lawyers Gu Jirong and others to file a lawsuit in the civil court of the First Special District Court, accusing Dai Jikui of failing to provide support. The subject of the lawsuit is a request for the court to order Dai to pay a lump sum of 20,160 yuan in support, and to confirm that the contract signed by the defendant with the plaintiff in March of the 18th year of the Republic of China for the management of fields and houses remains valid. The court has approved the lawsuit and ordered both parties to appear for questioning. After receiving the summons, Dai Jikui also hired lawyer Xuan Zhendong to file a defense and a counterclaim, requesting that Dai Huang return 64.4 mu of Sha fields, as well as clothing, leather trunks, and other items. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Shen Hong presided over the hearing in the sixth civil court. Dai stated that she remarried to the defendant in the sixth year of the Republic of China after the death of her first husband. At that time, the defendant was working as a waiter in the Huishang Hotel tea room. The following year, she gave birth to a daughter named Zhiying. Later, the defendant made a fortune by privately selling morphine. By the 12th year of the Republic of China, he bought a maid named Hongying. Before long, he committed adultery with her and she became pregnant. Since then, the defendant has been at odds with her and has taken Hongying out to rent a house and live separately. In March of the 18th year of the Republic of China, the defendant and the plaintiff signed a separation agreement, stipulating that the 64.4 mu of Changshu Jiao Sha fields he had purchased and a house in the Washi market of Sanxing Town, Liuhaisha, would be handed over to her to take her daughter to live in Sha and manage all the fields and houses. The rent would be used for her expenses, and the defendant would pay an additional 300 yuan per year. Later, because the market house in Sanxing Town collapsed, she still lives in Shanghai. In addition to the defendant paying for Zhiying's tuition, he also paid her an additional 130 yuan per month. In January of this year, the defendant's morphine trafficking case was exposed. He suspected that she had informed on him and stopped paying the monthly support of 120 yuan. It has been four months, and she cannot maintain her livelihood. When she asked for it, she was beaten. Therefore, she filed a lawsuit requesting that the defendant be ordered to pay a lump sum of 20,160 yuan, calculated at 120 yuan per month from January of this year to December of the 35th year of the Republic of China. Dai Jikui testified that he is 50 years old and from Zhenjiang. He stated that all of the plaintiff's statements are lies. He claimed that she is his mistress and that she is now seeing a younger sister because she sees that his business has failed. She is moving around in various Yanzike inns and tea houses and is not subject to his control. He is now asking the plaintiff to return to her hometown and live with him, and to hand over the 64.4 mu of fields and clothing trunks under her management. Witnesses Yang Mao and Wang Lianxiang testified about the circumstances of the plaintiff and defendant's acquaintance. After a long debate by the lawyers of both parties, Judge Shen announced that the debate on the case was concluded and that the verdict would be announced on the afternoon of the 29th of this month.</p>
<h3>Gong Changtai Sandboat Resists Pirates</h3>
<p>Ship Crew Killed, Six or Seven Wounded, Silver Coins Looted Clean</p>
<p>The Beiyang sandboat Gong Changtai, recently loaded a large quantity of salted fish in the Lushun area and set sail for Shanghai. On the 20th of this month, it sailed to the waters of Beitongsha. Due to a sudden strong wind and waves crashing onto the deck, the shipowner You Dekui, concerned about the heavy load, instructed the helmsman to sail towards the coast and anchor to take shelter from the wind. As the ship approached the coast, just as it was about to drop anchor, two large three-masted ships sailed towards it. The Gong Changtai initially did not suspect them of being pirate ships and steered to avoid them, while shouting to avoid a collision. Unexpectedly, the two ships ignored them. Seeing this, the shipowner You ordered the helmsman to retreat. The two pirate ships opened fire, forcing them to stop. The two pirate ships were smaller and faster, and they quickly approached. Shipowner You instructed the more than forty crew members to resist with all their might. One pirate jumped onto the side of the ship.</p>
<h3>New Attractions at the Gaohashi Seaside Bathing Beach</h3>
<p>Businessmen Establish Hotel and Garden and Are Willing to Advance Funds to Build a Motor Road</p>
<p>The Shanghai seaside bathing beach has seen an increase in Chinese and foreign tourists since it was slightly renovated by the Municipal Public Works Bureau last year. However, transportation has been inconvenient for many. The section from Gaohashi to the seaside bathing beach is a coal cinder road less than one zhang wide, accessible only by rickshaws. There is also a mud road less than a few chi wide, which even small cars cannot travel on. The Municipal Public Works Bureau originally planned to open a motor road directly from Gaohashi to the seaside bathing beach, but it could not be realized due to the municipality's financial constraints. It is now known that some businessmen plan to open a hotel and a garden at the seaside bathing beach to provide rest for tourists. The building has already been completed, and the garden is also under active construction. The businessmen are willing to advance funds for the road construction, which the municipal government will pay for in installments in the future. The municipal government is still considering this matter. Once the two parties reach an agreement, construction can begin.</p>
<p>A crew member shot the pirate into the sea with a bamboo bow. Seeing this, the pirates were extremely angry</p>
<p>and relentlessly pursued them, opening fire continuously. The crew members of the Gong Changtai desperately resisted. Six crew members, including the helper Ye, were shot and killed by the pirates, and six or seven were wounded. At this point, the crew members were frightened and panicked. Seeing the large number of pirates, they knew it would be difficult to resist and fled into the cabin. The two pirate ships caught up with the Gong Changtai, and about forty or fifty pirates swarmed onto the ship. They shot indiscriminately and slashed several people with knives. Shipowner You hid under the stove, but was dragged out by the pirates and forced to hand over silver coins. When he refused, the pirates beat him and tried to throw him into the sea. You could not bear the pain and had to hand over more than 700 yuan. They also searched the bodies of the crew members and those who were killed, and all the silver coins were looted. Before leaving, they kidnapped the accountant and the helmsman, fearing that the Gong Changtai would follow them, and smashed the rudder to prevent it from sailing. The two pirate ships fled to the East China Sea. The Gong Changtai drifted on the sea for a day and night. Later, the Qingkousha boat Zhou Dexing passed by and saw the Gong Changtai raising a distress flag. It sailed over and towed the Gong Changtai to the Liuhai Branch Port to moor. Shipowner You hired a small boat to take about twelve or thirteen injured crew members to Liuhai and sent them to the hospital for treatment. Yesterday, he sent crew members by train from Wusong to Shanghai to report to various merchants and borrow silver coins to go to Liuhai to buy coffins and collect the bodies of the crew members who were killed by the pirates. It is said that three injured crew members are in critical condition and their lives are in danger. At the same time, various cargo owners have telegraphed the naval and land authorities, instructing them to send police ships to strictly suppress the pirates in order to reassure merchants.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Cables Zhejiang and Shandong to Request Investigation and Release of He Fangpu</h3>
<p>Sugar merchant He Fangpu of this city is a native of Haining. He was kidnapped two years ago, but fortunately escaped danger. This time, he was falsely accused and arrested by the Zhejiang Provincial Special Service Team and taken to Hangzhou for interrogation. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Haichang Public Office have sent a telegram to Chairman Lu of Zhejiang Province requesting an investigation and release. The text of the telegram is recorded below: To Chairman Lu of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, on the 23rd of this month, we received a letter from the Sugar Trade Association stating that the member Junyi said in a letter that He Fangpu, a shareholder of their company, is 56 years old and a resident of Dongwuli, Xizang Road, Shanghai. His mother and brothers live in his hometown of Xieqiao Town, Haining. On the 21st of this month, Mr. He returned to his hometown to visit his relatives. He arrived home at about 8:00 a.m. and was happily reunited with his mother and brothers when suddenly, a member of the Fourth Section of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, accompanied by a special service team, claimed that they had a secret order from the authorities, saying that he was suspected of being pro-Japanese. They searched his home thoroughly, but found nothing. They then arrested He Fangpu and his brother. Although his brother was immediately released on bail, He Fangpu was taken to the province for detention. It is understood that Mr. He Fangpu once worked as a sugar salesman for Mitsui Yoko many years ago, but since the September 18th Incident, he has been indignant at the Japanese invasion and grieved at the impending national crisis. He immediately resigned and published a statement to show his determination to break with them. This arrest, saying that he is suspected of being pro-Japanese, is probably due to someone harboring resentment and making a false report. He is truly innocent and has been implicated. Therefore, we earnestly request your association to forward a telegram to the Zhejiang Provincial Government from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting his swift release to avoid injustice and protect human rights. According to this, it is understood that He Fangpu has been in the sugar business for more than 30 years. His conduct is upright, and his character is excellent, which is well known in our industry. Moreover, he has been separated from Mitsui for many years. Since leaving that company, he has been very enthusiastic about anti-Japanese work and has been very supportive of the national aviation salvation effort. His patriotism is no less than anyone else's. Being arrested for no reason is inevitably unjust. Our association is willing to be responsible for guaranteeing that there is absolutely no pro-Japanese activity. We are sending this letter to request your association to telegram the Zhejiang Provincial Government, requesting his swift release to avoid injustice and protect human rights. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce bows respectfully.</p>

<h3>Mr. Wang Yansong's Speech at the Sino-Western Broadcasting Station Yesterday</h3>
<p>How to Stabilize Finance During National Crisis</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Yansong, Standing Committee Member of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and Manager of the Silk Industry Bank, has not only been engaged in public affairs in recent years, but has also been keenly interested in the operation of the banking business. Recently, in view of the increasing national crisis and the decline of commerce, he has become more aware of the heavy responsibility of the financial community. He said that to save the country from disaster, everyone should start from their own position. Last night, at the invitation of the Sino-Western Broadcasting Station, he gave a speech on how to stabilize finance during the national crisis to inform the public. His speech was as follows:</p>
<p>For the past year, China has reached an extremely critical period. Speaking of the national crisis, the Japanese army has driven south, and Peiping and Tientsin are in danger. Speaking of society, the communist bandits in the interior have not been cleared, and the rural economy is bankrupt. Speaking of the economy, funds are biased and withered, and industry is dying. Under this state of a thousand sores and holes, once a special accident occurs, it can immediately set off a great wave and cause national chaos. The financial community is the hub of a country's economy. It feels the impact the fastest and its impact on people is the deepest. Therefore, in this situation of crisis and imminent danger, how should the financial community prepare at all times to deal with this dangerous environment and stabilize the national finance? We believe that there are five points that the financial community should pay special attention to:</p>
<p>First, strengthen reserves. The so-called banking business is nothing more than absorbing surplus funds from society on the one hand and supplying the needs of social funds on the other. However, banks are trusted by people and mostly have the obligation to pay on demand, while those who give credit to others must recover it when it is due. Therefore, banks have to maintain a considerable amount of reserves as preparation. In countries with sound financial systems, the amount of bank reserves is generally not very high, because too many reserves will lead to stagnant funds, which will also hinder the development of the banking business. Moreover, foreign financial markets have developed credit systems, with discount markets and rediscount adjustments, "banks of banks" for assistance, and clearing houses to save currency reserves. Therefore, in European and American countries, there is no need for too many reserves. But this is not the case in our country. The credit system has not yet been fully developed, and old habits are too deeply ingrained. Although bank reserve banks and clearing houses have recently been established, they are in their infancy, the organization is not yet fully sound, and the effects have not yet been popularized. Therefore, the banks' own reserves should be strengthened as much as possible, and a sufficient reserve ratio should be maintained at all times, adopting a policy of "rather too much than too little." In this way, the interior will be enriched and there will be no panic.</p>
<p>Second, concentrate efforts. There is a very close chain relationship between financial industries. They are by no means independent of each other. Therefore, if the financial industry is not good, we must strive for our own sound development. At the same time, we must concentrate and unify the strength of the whole to seek common stability and development. Especially in the serious state of national crisis, the need for this concentration of efforts is even more obvious. For example, the Shanghai Banking and Money Industry Joint Reserve Library in the "January 28 Incident" last year and the recent establishment of the Clearing House are examples. The creation of these two joint organizations is the first good phenomenon in our country's financial community. However, due to various relationships, the organization has not yet been fully perfected. For example, the Banking Industry Joint Reserve Library has only 26 members. It was originally a temporary emergency measure, with a term of five years. The nature of the organization is somewhat similar to the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, but it is still far from the true "bank of banks," because the necessary conditions for the so-called bank of banks must have concrete capital and unified issuance rights. For example, the recently established Clearing House has an average daily total of 5 million yuan in bill exchanges and more than 2,000 bills, which is quite a good achievement. However, the current Shanghai Clearing House is limited to 32 Chinese banks and their branches. All foreign banks and Qianzhuang [traditional Chinese banks] and a few Chinese banks are not included. The scope of services has not been universal. That is, 50% of the receipts and payments of the combined banks still follow the old habits and entrust agents. They still cannot use the Clearing House to settle accounts with banks and Qianzhuang outside the combination. From this point of view, the foundations of these two emerging joint organizations in China's financial community are not yet fully stable. Therefore, we should continue to work hard in the future. For example, in the Joint Reserve Library, if we can follow the example of the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, each member bank will allocate a certain percentage of its deposits as the public funds of the Joint Reserve Library. At the same time, the abolition of taels and the change to yuan has already been implemented, and the issuing banks can increase the issuance and withdraw their own reserve funds to consolidate the foundation of the Reserve Library. On the side of the Clearing House, we should strive to expand the scope of services so that we can reduce labor and capital risks, save currency, make finance more flexible, and promote unity and mutual assistance in the financial industry. In this way, the strength of the financial industry will be concentrated, and the external resistance will naturally increase. Even if there are storms, it can be handled with ease.</p>
<p>Third, maintain the price of public bonds. In recent years, many public bonds have been issued, and the public bond market has been very active. For example, the transaction volume in the 20th year was 3,341,000,000 yuan, and in the 21st year it was 901,710,000 yuan. After the issuance of these huge amounts of public bonds, a large part was kept by the banking community, because the methods of raising these public bonds, except for a few direct fundraising, were mostly underwritten or mortgaged by the Shanghai banking community. According to general speculation, the total amount of public bonds held by the banking community is about 30%. If we combine the public bonds owned by the banking community itself and the public bonds in the guarantee reserves issued by various banks, the number will certainly be more than this. From this we can see the close relationship between the financial industry and public bonds, and the great power of the financial community in the bond market. Recently, the situation in our country has been unstable, and the bond market has often changed drastically. The rise and fall of the bond market will certainly have a great impact on the banking industry. For example, if the public bonds in the guarantee reserves of various issuing banks have losses, they must be compensated with other properties. Therefore, in addition to the losses, other properties will also become stagnant. Large banks with solid foundations can still find ways to inject funds. Banks whose main business is buying and selling public bonds often have difficulties in circulating funds as a result. The impact is that a small number of banks will suffer losses, and a large number will be enough to cause a financial panic. Therefore, the stability of public bond prices is really a problem that the financial community cannot ignore.</p>
<p>Fourth, prudent lending. Since the "January 28 Incident," the financial community has learned a very important lesson. Therefore, it has adopted a very cautious and tight policy on lending, which is completely different from the previous reckless lending for the sake of high profits. This is certainly a very good approach, but we must know that the bank's duties are to regulate the market's finance. If the bank refuses to lend, the market's finance will be stagnant, which will not only lead to the decline of all industries, but sometimes it will be enough to cause a financial panic. Therefore, when the country is in trouble, banks should be cautious in lending, but they cannot not lend at all. Before lending, a detailed credit investigation should be carried out. The standard for lending should be based on people and things, because if it is completely based on people, sometimes the environment changes and they cannot maintain their credit. If it is based on things, the market price fluctuates. In short, banks should examine whether lending is necessary and safe. There must be no danger for both parties.</p>
<p>Fifth, avoid speculation. In recent years, China's inland economy has gone bankrupt, funds have been concentrated in urban areas, and there has been a surplus of funds, while industry and commerce have declined, and there is no way to use them. Under this state of abundant hot money, speculative transactions are naturally active, such as the bidding and buying, real estate buying and selling, and public bond buying and selling. The transaction volume is very large. These transactions are profitable and easy to recover, which is certainly easier to attract than industrial investment. However, we do not know that although the profits are high, the risks are also great. Once speculation fails, bankruptcy often follows. The financial industry is at the economic hub, so it is especially important to avoid speculation as much as possible, so as not to implicate the society.</p>
<p>The above five measures are the key points to stabilize finance during the national crisis. In normal times, when there is no external pressure, people in the financial community may be a little more casual, but now they cannot be casual, because now is the key to the survival of the country, and it is also the key to the life and death of the financial industry. If we want to save the country, we must start from our own position. If people in the financial industry can strive to stabilize finance, I think it will be the greatest contribution to the country, and it can also be said to be the greatest responsibility to save the country from disaster. The above words are my personal views. I know that my knowledge is shallow and my talent is poor, and there may be some improper places. I hope that the audience will give guidance and criticism. If you are kind enough to teach me, please send it to Mr. Wang Yansong, Silk Industry Bank, San Ma Road. I will accept it with twelve points of sincerity. End of speech.</p>
<h3>Donation Achievements for the Construction of the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association</h3>
<p>More than 200,000 Yuan Identified and Paid</p>
<p>The Pudong Fellow Villagers Association has raised funds to purchase land and build a clubhouse. It is stipulated that the fundraising period will be from the 1st to the 31st of this month. As the deadline is approaching, the other day, the captains of the fundraising teams were invited to the Atlantic Restaurant for a banquet. Ninety-nine people attended. After a few rounds of drinks, Du Yuesheng entrusted Mu Ouchu to stand up as a representative and said that the previous two announcements showed that more than 206,700 yuan had been identified and paid to the association, which was only half of the assumed amount. Please work hard, everyone. If the quota can be met at the end of the month, it will be the supreme honor for our fellow villagers. Zhang Xiaoliang, Huang Renzhi, Qu Shao Yi, Lu Songfang, Yang Qingyuan, Qu Shaoheng, Han Shangde, etc., also gave speeches one after another, which were both humorous and serious. Even the Guanghua and Meida Oil Companies, as corporate members, donated 10,000 yuan. All of our fellow villagers should be inspired to work hard and cite Lu Bohong, a Catholic friend in this city, who persuaded Westerners to donate to a certain charity organization, standing silently for three hours, tirelessly, and finally moved Westerners. It is still a beautiful story. It is said that many captains have expressed their willingness to follow Mr. Lu's example to work hard to solicit donations in order to meet the quota as scheduled.</p>

<h3>Seeking Two Missing Young Girls</h3>
<p>Fu Yuan, the 13-year-old daughter of the new drama artist Dong Biesheng, was wearing a blue Yin Dan Shi Lin cloth short shirt and black rain wool gauze pants with pockets. She had a bob haircut, large round eyes, and a slightly wide mouth. She went missing at 9:00 a.m. yesterday and was led away by A Mao, the daughter of Wang Baoqing in the downstairs wing room. A Mao was wearing a white polka dot cheongsam, also with a bob haircut, and was 15 years old. She was slightly thinner than Fu Yuan, but taller than Fu Yuan. Now both families are very anxious. If any kind-hearted gentlemen can send the people back, there will be a small reward. We are very grateful.

<h3>Reader's Advice to Go to the Frontier</h3>
<p>丨Letter from Mr. Wan Chongxian of this city丨</p>
<p>I previously saw in your column a letter from Mr. Xiang Qing, advocating going to the frontier, and your reporter's reply was, "It is only meaningful to go to the frontier after the politics and society of mainland China have become fairly clear." Regarding this matter, I sympathize with Mr. Xiang Qing. However, Mr. Xiang Qing's motivation stemmed from his inability to pursue further education and the difficulty of finding work in mainland China, so his intention to engage in land reclamation can be said to be entirely based on personal gain, which seems to have little significance. Indeed, he is a person who fears difficulties and seeks a comfortable life, deserting the battlefield and unwilling to constantly struggle against a bad environment. This is a great regret I hold for Mr. Xiang Qing. Indeed, the general cry of "go to the frontier" is intended to use the frontier as a final refuge, accommodating unemployed workers and farmers from the mainland in order to alleviate panic. Such people are likely to be timid and weak, not strong enemies of a dark society, and will be overcome by the environment. Therefore, we should clarify the purpose of "going to the frontier for land reclamation," set our sights further afield, and regard "land reclamation on the frontier" as an industry to revitalize the country and develop the resources of the border regions, so that our poor and weak country can achieve strength and prosperity. Only then will it be of great significance to talk about reclaiming the frontier and personally going there to reclaim it; otherwise, it will only be a refuge for the weak.</p>
<p>There are roughly three benefits to reclaiming the border regions:</p>
<p>(1) "Harmonizing the population." We know that the population density in southeastern China, especially Jiangsu Province, is the highest in the country. Conversely, when we look at the population in the northwest, the difference is like heaven and earth. This density and scarcity have become the main force behind China's poverty and weakness, as well as the inability of the five ethnic groups to integrate, leading to Tibetan soldiers rebelling.</p>
<p>(2) "Strengthening national defense." In recent years, there have been many incidents on the border, with disasters occurring repeatedly. Britain is eyeing the Tibetan border covetously, Japanese imperialism has forcibly occupied the northeast, and Soviet communism is affecting Outer Mongolia. Under these circumstances, the occupation of the border is highly likely, and there is a constant danger of it no longer being our territory. However, this matter cannot be ignored. We cannot allow strong neighbors to seize pieces of our entire territory. We should go to the border regions that people in the country do not like to go to, to do land reclamation work, in order to resist humiliation.</p>
<p>(3) "Developing resources." China is not a truly poor country. It is just that it has inexhaustible and endless treasuries of wealth, but is unwilling to take and use them! Therefore, the first task of going to the frontier is to cultivate the land and develop agriculture. China has always been a country that establishes itself on agriculture, yet we still have to buy American wheat. Isn't that a shameful thing? There is so much land, but no one lives there. There are such rich border regions, but no one wants to develop them, unless they are people who only want to enjoy existing benefits, and are unwilling to break new ground and do things that are closely related to the interests of the country and society. "There are indeed many incidents on the border," but if there were no compatriots from the mainland migrating to the northeast for land reclamation, Japanese imperialism would not have encountered so many righteous armies fighting against them after forcibly occupying the three provinces, and would not have been so exhausted. Therefore, if no one goes to the frontier for land reclamation, wouldn't it be even easier for the British to occupy the Tibetan border, etc.? Moreover, if the border defense is not strong, when the strong enemy invades, there will be no one to resist, let alone provide relief donations! Are the righteous armies formal troops? Of course, there were also people who did land reclamation work before. Without them, who knows to what extent the foreign invaders would have encroached on the country's territory. To say that we must wait until the politics are clear before going to the frontier is not the same as waiting for foreigners to seize the border before wanting to reclaim it, wouldn't that be terrible? Land reclamation in the border regions may, on the contrary, have a promoting force for the clarity of politics and society. As for the point that "it is certainly very difficult to make a living in the mainland: it is even more difficult to reclaim land in the frontier," as long as the goal is clear, anything that is beneficial to the people can be done. The word "difficult" does not exist in the minds of ambitious young people.</p>
<p>Therefore, I think it is not a bad thing to go to the frontier for land reclamation, as long as the purpose of going is clear. Therefore, I would like to ask you, sir, to give a concrete answer to the questions raised by Mr. Xiang Qing in "How to go to the frontier for land reclamation," which can also serve as a reference and lesson for those who share the same aspirations as Mr. Xiang Qing. I would be most fortunate.</p>
<p>Answer: Your letter supports the proposition of "going to the frontier for land reclamation." Before answering your letter, the reporter would like to make a statement that we are not absolutely opposed to going to the frontier, but we advocate that it is only meaningful to go to the frontier under certain conditions. However, your three reasons are not sufficient: First, the population problem is an extremely complex problem in economics. Bourgeois economists believe that there is a risk of absolute overpopulation, so there are theories of population regulation, theories of birth control, theories of eliminating the weak and preserving the strong, and immigration policies such as your so-called "harmonizing the population." In fact, you and they are both misunderstanding the population problem. China's population density, no matter how compared with that of any capitalist country, cannot be considered extremely dense. It must be known that there is no such thing as absolute overpopulation, only relative overpopulation. The current relative overpopulation in China is directly or indirectly dominated by the productive forces of capitalism. How is that explained? (1) The productive forces of capitalism have increased the quantity and speed of production, reducing the use of laborers, thus creating a crisis of unemployment for urban workers: the invasion of capitalism into the countryside has caused unemployment and bankruptcy in the countryside, and large numbers of unemployed farmers have poured into the cities, where factories, due to rationalized production, have abandoned large numbers of workers, thus forming an industrial reserve army: this is the phenomenon of population surplus in modern capitalist society, and China is no exception. (2) However, China is a country ruled by imperialism, and because of its high pressure and brutal exploitation, China's rural areas are rapidly going bankrupt. In addition, it uses China's warlords, bureaucrats, and all rulers as tools, and there are fierce conflicts between their imperialisms. This conflict is also reflected in the fact that China has been in civil war for more than ten years, so China's rural areas are even more irreparably ruined. China's population surplus is the result of the bankruptcy of China's rural areas, not the disharmonious relationship between "density and scarcity" as you assume. As for "the inability of the five ethnic groups to integrate" and "the rebellion of Tibetan soldiers," etc., they have nothing to do with this issue. The reason why the five ethnic groups cannot integrate is, on the one hand, because the Chinese revolution has not solved any problems for the rural areas, nor has it solved any problems for the various ethnic groups, and the corrupt officials, local bullies, warlords, and politicians have exploited them at every level, "like water becoming deeper, like fire becoming hotter." The recent arming of Tibet and the rebellion of the Hui people are all caused by this and not by that. If it is said that the scarcity and disharmony of the population is enough to cause wars between ethnic groups, then why haven't we heard of conflicts being caused by the sparse population of Siberia in the Soviet Union and the dense population of Moscow and Leningrad? Second, the theory of "strengthening national defense" is also specious. Zhang Xueliang and his son raised hundreds of thousands of soldiers in the three northeastern provinces and ruled the army for twenty years. The military strength was not insignificant, and the population of the three northeastern provinces was not small, but why did Japanese imperialism enter as if there was no one there? If it is said that a dense population will not be invaded by others, then there is the example of Liaoning, and your theory is untenable. If it is said that a dense population can prevent the danger of communism, then why are there always dangers of communism in Shanghai, Tokyo, New York, and other large cities with extremely dense populations? Your theory is even more untenable: it can be seen that the way to resist humiliation also lies in this and not in that. Third, the phrase "developing resources" sounds very good. But I want to ask you: Who will develop them? With what will they be developed? How will they be developed? If a person loses his job in the mainland or in a large industrial city and cannot find food to eat, how can preparing to go to the frontier to be a "Robinson Crusoe" be linked to the issue of developing resources? Even mainland China has uncultivated fields and thousands of miles of barren land, so who can be expected to develop the resources of the frontier? Moreover, under the current political conditions, there is absolutely no possibility of developing the resources of the frontier: otherwise, it would be in the name of "cooperating with a certain country," turning against the guests, handing over a great territory to imperialism, benefiting a few brokers, and burying national sovereignty. In reality, studying social problems must be based on actual conditions, and not rely entirely on wishful thinking: otherwise, it will be useless.</p>

<h3>Old Newspapers Are Good</h3>
<p>— Shanlu</p>
<p>Those who worship old morals all say: "Science is good when it's new, morality is good when it's old." This is because they see all sorts of disturbances arising in society after the bankruptcy of old morals; therefore, they say such things.</p>
<p>Those who like to use old acquaintances all say: "Clothes are good when they're new, people are good when they're old." This is because they see that most of the unreliable people in the world are new acquaintances, not old friends: if they are old friends, I already know their temperament, and they will definitely not expose my flaws; therefore, they say such things.</p>
<p>I have recently had a prejudice against all sorts of things that people think are good when they're new; I oppose them all. People say: Articles are good when they're new. I say: Correct. People say: Poems are good when they're new. I say: Correct. People say: Plays are good when they're new. I say: Correct. People say: Newspapers are good when they're new. I shake my head vigorously and say: Incorrect, incorrect, newspapers are good when they're old, not good when they're new.</p>
<p>This is what I want to declare in advance: When I say newspapers are not good when they're new, I am not saying that the organization of the newspaper is not good, or the writing is not good; what I hate is that the news in the newspaper is not good. The newer the newspaper, the worse the news, and in this respect, my affection for newspapers decreases.</p>
<p>Every morning, everyone rushes to read the brand-new newspaper of the day, but I don't want to read it. I want to read the newspaper from the previous month, only because the situation in Beiping and Tianjin was not so tense then, and there were still records of Song Zheyuan killing the enemy. I also want to read the newspaper from the previous year, only because in the newspaper from the previous year, the September 18th Incident had already started, but things were still fine inside the passes. There was also Ma Zhanshan's victory at Nenjiang. I also want to read the newspaper from several years ago, only because in the newspaper from several years ago, the three northeastern provinces were still under the blue sky and white sun, and the land of the Republic of China was intact, and had not yet been broken by a country with wild ambitions.</p>
<p>Newspapers are good when they're old. The more you search in old newspapers, the more you see that the old situation was better than the new situation. It may sound funny, but when I see the headlines in today's newspaper, I become unhappy. Occasionally, on a corner of an old newspaper used to wrap copper coins, I see a passage about the grand opening ceremony of the Huludao construction project, and I find it very interesting, and I want to read it again after reading it once. Why do I have such feelings for old newspapers? Even I myself am a bit baffled.</p>
<h3>What I Saw on the Road</h3>
<p>— Shi Ziqin</p>
<p>Not long ago, a case of wrongful arrest and killing of a Chinese person occurred in this city. The reason was that two women were sitting together in a rickshaw, which violated the regulations, resulting in a conflict and leading to this tragedy. This matter caused a sensation at the time, but now it has gradually subsided, without a sound, becoming a past event among the small things of Shanghai this year.</p>
<p>Regarding two people sitting in the same rickshaw, it is certainly a violation of the regulations, and in order to maintain the regulations and dignity, it should indeed be prohibited, but for the Annamese patrolman to use weapons to threaten and cause this death, it is truly a belittling of the lives of us Chinese people.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday (the 20th), after coming out of the City God Temple, while passing near the Great Bell, I encountered a similar incident again. Two women were driven off a rickshaw by an Annamese patrolman. The rickshaw puller pleaded bitterly, but the patrolman was completely unmoved and insisted on taking him in for questioning. Just as the commotion was happening, coincidentally, a rickshaw came from the west, carrying a seductive "salty water girl" sitting on the lap of a French sailor, making all sorts of lewd gestures, and pulling towards this side. So, many friends who were watching the excitement clamored for the patrolman to go up and intervene. This put the patrolman in a difficult position. He didn't dare to drive the French sailor off the rickshaw, so he could only take his anger out on the rickshaw puller, telling him to stop and demanding to take him in for questioning. The rickshaw puller really stopped, and as the patrolman was about to take him, the French sailor jumped out of the rickshaw, pushed him, and shouted in French, "What are you doing?" The patrolman was immediately stunned and speechless, shrugged his shoulders, touched his gun, and watched the French sailor take the "salty water girl" back into the rickshaw and drive away. He even let the rickshaw that had started the whole thing go.</p>
<p>Alas! Is it law? Is it human sentiment? Is it power?</p>
<h3>A Brief Study of Shennong</h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>The day before yesterday was the Farmers' Festival, and someone asked me what Shennong looked like. So, I consulted ancient history, and there were quite a few things worthy of remembrance, so I will describe them as follows.</p>
<p>Shennong's surname was Yiqi, also written as Qi, and the world took it to be the surname of Yao, which is actually not the case. His name was Gui, and his mother was Andeng. She was moved by a god at Changyang and gave birth to Shennong in a stone chamber on Lieshan Mountain. This is now Zhongshan Mountain in Licheng Village, north of Suixian County, Jiangxia. Examining the map of Jingzhou, it says that west of Yongyang County is Licheng Mountain, and east of the mountain is a stone cave, thirty feet high and two hundred feet long, called Shennong Cave. Shennong was born here, and Laozi was also born here. Shennong was eight feet and seven inches tall, with a dragon face and large lips. He was born three days after the lunar calendar began and could speak, he could walk after five days, and he had teeth after seven mornings. At the age of three, he knew about farming and the business of leisure. He must perform his deeds with millet and sorghum, seeking the grains that the people liked on the sunny side of Qishan Mountain and cultivating them, knowing that they could feed the people, dividing the benefits of the land, and taking advantage of the time of the heavens. Therefore, he cultivated the benefits of fire, and the people were able to calculate, so he used fire to record time, and that is why he was called Emperor Yan. Shennong's policies and teachings were: "The people are the foundation of the country, and food is the heaven of the people. If agriculture is not proper, food will not be sufficient. If the people are not proper, their actions will not be sincere. If scholars are strong and do not farm, they will suffer hunger. If women are of age and do not weave, they will suffer cold." Therefore, he made plows and hoes, and agriculture began to flourish. He also tasted all kinds of herbs, thus establishing prescriptions. Military strategists say, "Shennong used stones as weapons and attacked Busui," so military affairs were also prepared for this. During the Han Dynasty, there was still a chapter on Shennong's military tactics, which can prove this. As for Shennong seeking rain, his theory is different from that of Shizi, who said, "Shennong governed the world, and when he wanted rain, it would rain. Five days were called traveling rain, ten days were called grain rain, and fifteen days were called timely rain," which was called divine rain, but it is hardly believable that Chisongzi was Shennong's rain master. Shennong had his capital in Chen, and the Chen City in Wanquiu is its location. When he died, he was buried at the end of Chaxiang in Changsha, which is called Chaling. Today, it is called the "Emperor's Tomb," and the Tang Dynasty once worshiped him there. Emperor Taizu of the Song Dynasty dreamed of Shennong and dispatched envoys to seek him, because the Song Dynasty used fire to record time. If it is said that it is "venerating agriculture," then it is not.</p>
<h3>Advertisement</h3>
<p>— Xianxian</p>
<p>The joy of a new opening requires placing an advertisement, a "closing-down sale" also requires placing an advertisement. "Price increases on goods"</p>
<p>requires placing an advertisement, "Regardless of cost, buy one get one free" also requires placing an advertisement. "Marriage", "cohabitation", advertisements are placed, "divorce", "breaking up with a mistress", advertisements are also placed. "Sixtieth birthday celebration", advertisements are placed, "funeral route" also requires placing an advertisement. "Seeking employment", "rental" advertisements are placed, "hiring", "seeking" advertisements are also placed. "Looking for a person" advertisements are placed, "looking for a dog" also requires placing an advertisement. The use of advertisements, judging from the above,</p>
<p>is vast beyond imagination.</p>
<p>What is mentioned above are advertisements placed with money</p>
<p>, in addition, there are also advertisements placed without spending money.</p>
<p>All news is free advertising. For example, if a rumor spreads that "XX Chinese troops have withdrawn," tomorrow, there will be a special dispatch with a large headline stating "XX troops are still in their original positions," and there is even "slight progress." If a rumor spreads that "the X case will be directly negotiated," tomorrow, there will be "a responsible person's conversation," proving that this is baseless and not credible. Such things, though nominally news, are actually statements or advertisements without spending money.</p>
<p>In the "XX" battle, our army won a great victory, killing thirteen enemies,</p>
<p>capturing even more, including one machine gun, more than twenty rifles, and countless military supplies. Following this, there will be "lack of XX, hoping for assistance from all sides." This is a fundraising advertisement. As for news like "So-and-so has a slight cold and refuses to see guests," it is entirely an advertisement of "No admittance." It is said that ordinary people are not qualified to publish these free advertisements without spending a penny. However, in my opinion, that is not entirely true. In recent days, newspapers have been running a free advertisement for "Gao Yatouzi of Shun Yuan Tang Barbershop." "An unidentified male corpse found at such-and-such location," "Old woman crushed to death by a car," "Rape of a six-year-old girl," "Robbery of a gold ring," "Food poisoning from eating yellow croaker," "Coolie collapses from heatstroke" and other free advertisements are all about ordinary people. It can be known that the status of this kind of "free advertisement" is not something that people with status can exclusively possess, but even if someone with status "sneezes three times in a row," it is advertising material, while ordinary people do not have this qualification.</p>

<h3>Fourth Company Commander of Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Seven: Severing Affection with a Few Words, Crying Bitterly Behind Closed Doors; Shouldering Righteousness, Discussing with Wine</p>
<p>Tian Qing smiled at Yin Deren and said, "What the old gentleman said is still heroism. In this era,</p>
<p>people should be ordinary, and heroes are in the category of being overthrown." Old Zhao put down his wine glass</p>
<p>, placed both hands on the edge of the table, stretched his head forward, and looked at Tian Qing and said, "Brother, you think I don't understand what you're talking about? I've known much more about it for a long time. When I lived in the city, the young masters of the neighborhood families who studied at the university often talked about this, and I'm tired of hearing it. Where are the heroes in China? Even if there are heroes, they wouldn't have brought the country to this state. Now we're hoping for someone to shoulder the responsibility for the country, but they haven't been born yet, and they still want to be overthrown." Brothers Tian, you're young and like to say these new things." Tian Qing smiled and said, "I'm not saying new things. I admire the old gentleman for still having such ambitions." Yin Deren raised his wine glass high above his head and said loudly, "What the old gentleman said is correct. Let's offer a toast." Everyone listened and actually raised their glasses and drank it down. Guan Yaowu sat opposite Zhao Ziqiang and nodded to him, saying, "Your old gentleman has such great insights. It's not easy! If you could arrange a marriage and let the old gentleman hold a grandson, I think the old gentleman would be even more willing to let you go and do it." Zhao Ziqiang picked up the wine pot and, across the table, poured wine for Guan Yaowu. He received the wine cup with both hands, and Zhao Ziqiang smiled and said, "This glass of wine is a special toast to you. I hope that in the future, you don't persuade people to follow your example." Guan Yaowu took the wine and returned to his seat, and he smiled and said, "Do you think I'm suffering enough with one wife and a bunch of children?" Zhao Ziqiang smiled and said, "I don't know. What do you think?" Tian Qing waved his hand randomly and said, "You two are not considering the same thing at all. Marriage should be based on love, not on finding advantages outside of love." Yin Deren picked up a chicken bone with his chopsticks and pointed it at him, saying, "Stop it. Do you think everyone who marries a wife is like you?" (81)</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>Monk Hanshan (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Huo Xueming</p>
<p>The emerald green water gradually rises, carried by a piece of rush sail. Taking advantage of</p>
<p>the tight westerly wind, it sails from the other end of the canal towards Maple Bridge.</p>
<p>Fine rain is falling, and the reeds on the beach are like a felt blanket of white swan down, undulating vigorously, it is an autumn evening. The shore is full of maple forests, and one or two red leaves fly down, quiet and somewhat solemn.</p>
<p>Slender Monk Hanshan, at this time, is wearing a birch bark crown,</p>
<p>barefoot, chopping firewood in the temple yard. He lifts up a torn robe high, tying it with a wide belt around his waist, working very diligently. Suddenly, he hears the sound of oars outside the temple, his heart trembles, and he immediately drops the axe, saying softly, "Could it be that my master Shide has really come to Suzhou." He pats his mud-stained hands, holds up an umbrella, and hurries along the narrow grassy path towards the pier. The sound of the oars gradually approaches.</p>
<p>Before reaching the pier, he can already see that the boat is moored to a bald willow tree on the shore. A short, fat monk walks across the plank, that is Shide. The boatman shouts:</p>
<p>"Master Shide, why don't you open your umbrella? It's raining hard!"</p>
<p>But regardless of how concerned the voice is, Shide only slowly turns his head, gives a grateful glance, and waddles forward in the rain like a goose. Raindrops are jumping on top of his shiny bald head. The boatman smiles inexplicably and rows the boat back.</p>
<p>Shide's shadow, face, and entire body are gradually reflected in Hanshan's eyes. He is very happy, his mouth twists, full of smiles. "Yo! This is very interesting, see, he doesn't see me at all!" Thinking this, he plans to play a joke on him, so he takes the opportunity to hide in the maple forest by the road, just like a hunchbacked heron in the light of the setting sun, opening his eyes to peep at the fat goose walking closer in the reflection of the red leaves. He laughs to himself.</p>
<p>However, Monk Shide still walks forward slowly in the heavy rain: rain pours down from his shiny head, down into his eyes, shoulders, back, and black robe, he seems to know nothing. The oil umbrella is tucked under his arm, but it remains tucked under his arm.</p>
<p>Maple forest leaves, mixed with raindrops, scrape onto Shide's face in groups, and some even stick to it: he doesn't move his hand at all, letting his face be stained with mottled patches. Although he walks mechanically, he gradually moves further away, not far from Hanshan Temple. This makes slender Hanshan, hiding in the forest full of red leaves, watch his wet, black robe, hanging down with raindrops, making him look disheveled; he is still making fun of him like this, and he feels a little embarrassed. But why does he have an umbrella but doesn't avoid the rain? Maple leaves stick all over his face, and he doesn't try to take them off? This is simply foolish! Many people want to maintain a false sense of dignity, looking with their eyes at their noses, walking straight ahead with their eyes never wavering. In Hanshan's eyes, that is not only deceiving others, but also deceiving oneself. Why bother to be so artificial, "not contending with things," and tormenting one's own body! "Bah! Poor goose!" He begins to feel a kind of disgust towards Shide. But only to the extent that a modern youth despises an old man.</p>
<p>The rain continues, and because the wind is blowing hard: it is more violent than before,</p>
<p>and louder. Disordered maple leaves, like red butterflies, are woven into the silver rain net everywhere, hitting Shide's body and hitting the oil umbrella held by Hanshan.</p>
<p>Smoke is already rising from the Tie Ling Pass mountain house, and Hanshan Temple is also striking the evening</p>
<p>bell, a vast outline of the night, blurring the distance, gradually deepening, like thick mirage, spreading into the nearby maple forest. The night in the mountains is indeed easier to brew than on the plains.</p>
<p>After several considerations, Hanshan finally restrained his childishness, jumped out of the maple forest, and quickly chased behind Shide. Just looking at his ridiculous walking posture, he feels that such a fool is quite interesting, facing his own curious feelings. Just like a person who loves to watch slapstick movies, holding the same interest. Although the foolishness performed by the slapstick characters has an even more sorrowful taste lurking inside. In comparison, Hanshan is as fast as a lark, approaching Shide. He can hear the fat, short man breathing heavily with exhaustion, and the trembling of his flesh. Seeing this tired and weak appearance of the old man, Hanshan's heart aches a little. Using a sympathetic, loving, almost pitying tone, he catches up and calls out:</p>
<p>"Master Shide, walk slower. Hanshan is here."</p>

<h3>Education News</h3>
<p>Important News: All Schools in Beiping Decide to Postpone Moving South</p>
<p>(Beiping, 25th) Previously, due to the tense situation in North China, schools were effectively closed down. They have now reopened one after another. However, because many students have left the school to go elsewhere, the number of students attending classes is still very small. Furthermore, the national universities once prepared to move south, but because the railway bureau could not allocate vehicles for a while, they could not start. Now, they have also decided to postpone the move.</p>
<h3>Middle Schools Allowed to Administer Sample Examinations and Elementary Schools Allowed to Handle Matters Flexibly in Entrance Examinations Based on Special Circumstances</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 25th) The Ministry of Education, due to the practical difficulties reported by various provinces and cities in holding entrance examinations for primary and secondary schools, has decided that for the end of this academic year, middle schools are allowed to administer sample examinations and elementary schools are allowed to handle matters flexibly, based on the special circumstances of each province and city. As for the saying that the Ministry of Education has issued an order to cancel the entrance examinations, it is too early to say.</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of entrance examinations for primary and secondary schools, the secondary school portion will still be carried out in accordance with the ministry's order, which is imperative. As for the elementary school entrance examinations, the Jiangsu Department of Education once presented reasons and requested the Ministry of Education to handle matters flexibly. Recently, the Hunan Department of Education also submitted a memorial listing many reasons, requesting the Ministry of Education to handle matters flexibly. It is heard that Article 2 of the regulations for entrance examinations for primary and secondary school graduates promulgated by the Ministry of Education, which states that "before holding the entrance examination, a request should be submitted for approval and registration," contains room for flexibility. It is also heard that the Ministry of Education will not make an announcement to cancel the elementary school portion of the entrance examinations, nor will it explicitly state that entrance examinations must be held, but will consider the local situation and allow the education departments to handle matters flexibly based on the actual situation. The Ministry of Education will issue a public order soon.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education in Consultation on How to Handle Zhongshan University Disturbance</h3>

<h3>Turmoil at the Imperial University of Japan</h3>
<p>Professor Takigawa's Criminal Law Reader Contains Radical Content</p>
<p>Ministry of Education Dismisses Takigawa; University Faculty and Students Resist</p>
<h3>Takigawa's Recently Published Criminal Law Reader</h3>
<p>(United Press Tokyo,</p>
<p>25th) Takigawa Yukitoki, a professor in the Faculty of Law at Kyoto Imperial University, was involved in a dismissal issue due to the radical content of his book "Criminal Law Reader," which offended the authorities. The Ministry of Education has taken a tough stance on this issue, but the university faculty, including the president and all students, are defending Professor Takigawa's academic freedom and have opposing opinions to the Ministry of Education. The Ministry of Education has decided to convene a civil servant disciplinary committee at the Prime Minister's official residence at 1:00 PM today to discuss the issue of punishing Takigawa. The outcome is likely to lead to a university-wide movement, and the future is highly noteworthy.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Dismisses Takigawa (China United News Agency, 2</h3>
<p>5th, Tokyo) The Japanese Cabinet convened a civil servant division committee at 3:00 PM this afternoon. The Ministry of Education requested a review of the suspension case of Takigawa Yukitoki, a professor in the Faculty of Law at Kyoto Imperial University. The Ministry of Education sent Vice Minister Araya and Director of Special Academic Affairs Akama to the meeting to explain the truth. Based on Article 11, Section 1 of the Civil Servant Division Order, they requested the dismissal of Professor Takigawa, as Minister Hatoyama and President Konishi of Kyoto University had a direct conflict, and this was the result of that plan.</p>
<h3>Faculty and Students of Kyoto University Resign and Withdraw (China United News Agency, 2</h3>
<p>5th, Osaka) After President Konishi of Kyoto Imperial University returned to Kyoto, he reported the situation with Hatoyama to Dean of Law Miyamoto. Miyamoto immediately convened a meeting of the faculty of law to discuss countermeasures. It is heard that they have decided to resign en masse and fight the Ministry of Education to the end. At 2:00 PM today, President Konishi convened a joint meeting of faculty and staff from all departments. Konishi attended the meeting and reported the detailed situation. Faculty and staff from all departments were angered by the excessive oppression of the Ministry of Education and decided to take the same action as the faculty and staff of the Faculty of Law, which will be implemented after Professor Takigawa is dismissed. Students across the entire university also held a student congress and adopted a unified course of action with the faculty association. If the Ministry of Education does not reflect, the turmoil at Kyoto University will lead to an unprecedented large-scale disturbance.</p>
<h3>Military Training Examinations for All Schools to be Held After Summer Training</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 25th) The General Training Supervision Department has ordered military instructors in all schools to uniformly hold the military training examinations for this semester after one week of summer vacation training.

<h3>Inter-Departmental Soccer: Two Bloody Battles Yesterday</h3>
<h3>Xinwen Wins Over Shibao by One Goal, a Satisfactory Conclusion</h3>
<h3>Shenbao Turns Defeat into Victory, Minbao Miserable</h3>
<p>A haze of sorrow, a gentle east wind, and several drizzles in the morning made the veteran soldiers heading for the battlefield quite worried. If the rain stopped the game, wouldn't that be a disaster? Fortunately, by 3:00 PM, the sun came out. A light rain had settled the dust on the field, making it soft and level, perfect for a grand battle.</p>
<h3>Xinwen Wins Over Shibao</h3>
<h3>Xinwen Bao Misses Three Opportunities</h3>
<p>Xinwen specializes in softness, while Shibao specializes in hardness. In form, it is difficult to say which is superior, but hardness can easily lead to stiffness. In the end, Xinwen won by one goal. However, Fan Jingwu of the "Jiangbei Little Five," who delivered the bomb yesterday, deserves credit. "Jiang Zhongyi almost even"</p>
<p>The leader became excited, and it would be ungrateful not to thank him. Li Gengxi of Shibao is also a talented individual, compensating for weaknesses and paying attention to detail. Wang Mengnian is bold and fast, making him the most feared player in Xinwen's defense. Shao Yizhi remained calm and composed, a good general. Old Teng looked like a hungry tiger, but unfortunately, he didn't catch the lost sheep yesterday, no wonder he sighed and said, "Poor luck." The game began with Xinwen taking the offensive. Chen Tongsong continuously seized opportunities, while Lu Yi stumbled twice, causing everyone to worry about Shibao.</p>
<h3>Jiang Zhongyi Scores a Goal</h3>
<p>Fortunately, Chen Dafan was extremely brave, Liu Jianwu was not the same as before, and Shao Yizhi defended the southeast corner with broad strokes, preventing the northern barbarians from grazing their horses southward. Fan Jingwu kicked the ball far away, and Pei Shunyuan rushed forward with a shout. Lu Yi seized the opportunity to kill. Jiang Zhongyi, a guy from Zhongyi Hall, had the courage of a mountain. He and Chen Tongsong broke into Shibao's penalty area together. Chen Dafan could not resist, and Lu Guangjie rushed out. Jiang Zhongyi carried both the man and the ball into the net. How brave!</p>
<h3>Shibao's Counterattack Proves Ineffective</h3>
<p>Mr. Duhe clapped thunderously and immediately promised a reward. If they could prevent another loss, they would hold a celebration banquet tomorrow. Indeed, under a heavy reward, there must be brave men. Fan Jingwu had good luck and did not miss a kick. Pei Shunyuan also used all his strength, preparing to drink an extra cup tomorrow to compensate for his hard work. No matter how formidable Lao Teng and Wang Mengnian are, they could not break through the defense. At the same time, Jiang Zhongyi and his brother Jiang Zhongdao did not hesitate to turn against each other, fighting fiercely. Lei Xiaofu, a Shandong man, and Hu Laohan, a rickshaw puller, had better opportunities, but they were lightly missed. Time flies, and the whistle suddenly blew.</p>
<h3>Xinwen Bao Lineup</h3>
<p>Jiang Jianhou, Qiu Hongsheng, Shao Bonan, Yu Kongwo, Pei Shunyuan, Fan Jingwu, Li Zutang, Lu Yi, Jiang Zong, Chen Wen, Wang Jie.</p>
<h3>Shibao Lineup</h3>
<p>Liu Jianwu, Chen Dafan, Shen Mudan, Shao Yizhi, Li Gengxi, Lei Xiaofu, Ren Nai, Wang Meng, Jiang Zhong, Teng Shugu, Wang Dajun, Hu Hanzhu.</p>
<h3>Shenbao Wins Over Minbao</h3>
<h3>Shenbao Concedes a Goal First</h3>
<p>It is said that Zhao Junhao, a neutral member of the Shenbao football committee, had bet with Sun Daosheng that if they could win over Minbao by four goals, Zhi Mei Lou would provide two seats for a feast. At the same time, secretary Ji Zhizhong also added a condition that if they could score three goals and win, Daqing Hall would host a feast. But the result was two to one. Zhao and Ji's money was safe, but the Shenbao warriors were not so lucky. This is how it happened: Shenbao was ambitious, and the players' minds were filled with images of food and wine, so they fought very hard. After seven minutes of stalemate, Minbao launched a major attack. Chen Wanli shot at the goal, and Cai Shenfu's kick was ineffective. The ball went into the net first.</p>
<h3>Xie Hong's Header Brings the Game to a Tie, Preventing Lao Sun from Being Doused with Cold Water</h3>
<p>The chubby Qian Hua was even more heartbroken. After a break, the lineup was adjusted. Jiang Huaiqing was called back to defend the camp with confidence, allowing the frontline soldiers to attack without worry. Jiang Hongjiao was good at using the "Li Gong Cane," which frightened the enemy. Wu Zhongyi played well in silence. After five minutes, Sun Daosheng launched a rebellion, shouting and killing. He rushed into the penalty area and crossed the ball, Xie Hong headed the ball, and the score was tied.</p>
<p>Sun Daosheng Turns Defeat into Victory. At this point, the Shenbao frontline soldiers were extremely active, surrounding the Minbao goal and not dispersing. Zhu Mingxin crossed the ball three times, but no one was able to connect. Wu Zhongyi charged forward with great vigor, charging left and right like a bull demon. Jiang Hongjiao wanted to be brave but careful, fast but strong. Within three minutes, they were still able to hold half of the country, but disaster struck unexpectedly. Xie Hong quickly passed three checkpoints but was unfortunately tripped. Sun Daosheng arrived in time, kicked the ball, and the ball went into the net. Although Minbao wanted to negotiate peace, the final whistle soon blew.</p>
<h3>Shenbao Lineup</h3>
<p>Wang Xilian up, Jiang Huaiqing down, Qian Hua up, Li Zunyong down, Huang Jiping, Cai Shenfu, Xie Hong up, Lu Erqiang down,</p>
<p>Qian Hua down, Jin Huating up, Li Zunyong up, Wang Xilian down, Zhu Mingxin, Sun Daosheng, Xie Hong down, Jiang Huaiqing up, Jin Hua Li down, Sheng Erqiang up.</p>
<h3>Minbao Lineup</h3>
<p>Wu Zhongyi, Jiang Hongjiao, Gao Xuepu, Zhao Shukui, Chen Jingshu, Tang Xibo, Zhou Yinxin, Chen Wanli, Zhang Zhen, Chen Jingzhao.</p>
<h3>Today's Final Battle</h3>
<p>The six teams of veteran soldiers are full of energy. Since Shenbao and Xinwen Bao started at the sports field, today at 4:00 PM, Shibao and Chenbao will conclude at the same venue. This can be said to have a beginning and an end, and it is worth reporting that some Shibao players have left Shanghai on official business, but they are determined not to give up, especially as they have gathered enough players to compete with Chenbao, who has a chance to win the championship. The non-capricious boys are able to come up with it, but it is a unique feature of the veteran soldiers. Chenbao has not lost yet, and it is still unknown whether this will be a perfect ending for them. It all depends on the efforts of both sides.</p>

<h3>Random Notes from the Battlefield</h3>
<p>Singing the "Fell Lu" opera was originally a seasonal play during theater closings. Yesterday's game between this newspaper and Minbao was the last time this newspaper participated in the inter-departmental competition, so it was decided to reverse the roles, allowing all the original veteran players to act as heavenly gatekeepers in the first half. The fattest player in the newspaper, Wang Donggua (Xilian), was appointed as the goalkeeper, and the Ningbo Donggua (Qian Hua) and Haimen Donggua (Huang Jiping), who also resembled a drizzle, were appointed as inner guards. It was truly a team of three fat men, a veritable fat formation.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Wang Xilian wore a Western-style shirt, unbuttoned, with yellow shorts and colored shoes, and wore glasses. He rolled up his sleeves, revealing half of his jade legs, looking like an executioner on the battlefield from afar. Huang Jiping, since being injured in the previous battle with Shishi, ran with both hands behind him, leaning forward. He secretly learned Qian Hua's skills in the dark, even using his belly to block the ball. Cai Shenfu tried to protect the goal but unexpectedly caused a tragedy. It was fate.</p>
<p>In the second half, the executioner-style Donggua Wang Xilian served as the left forward, eager to atone for his sins. His face was full of ferocity. Unexpectedly, a ball hit his face, and although his front teeth did not fall out, they were shaking. Jin Huating sweated for him on the sidelines. Sun Daosheng, who had a single injured arm, was selfless and devoted, making great contributions. Xie Hong, the vanguard, ran all over the field, passing five checkpoints and slaying six generals to protect the universe. Zhuang Huaiqing made a small test with a bull's knife, frightening the enemy. Li Zunyong and Lu Erqiang were good at both offense and defense, making people feel like they couldn't go forward. Zhu Mingxin's long legs made it easy to run and attack the goal twice. Wu Zhongyi shouted to be polite. Jiang Hongjiao was stubborn and unyielding, one tall and one short, and therefore fell in love.</p>
<p>The reverse role play lasted for forty minutes, leaving everyone covered in sweat. As a result, it became a drama of one turn, but this time we borrowed the baseball field from the sports field. Mr. Shen Huichun and Zhang Longhai served as referees, and Mr. Wang Jianming served as a volunteer recorder. We would like to express our gratitude to the committees, advisors, and staff of the newspaper, and to the companies that donated jerseys and shoes. This team will forever remember and appreciate their kindness.</p>
<h3>Sports Reporter Team Officially Opens on the Dragon Boat Festival</h3>
<p>To Compete Against Teachers from Shangzhong</p>
<p>It is embarrassing to say that since we posted the advertisement the day before yesterday, our small shop has been bustling with customers. We have received orders from Shangzhong and Yangjing. Knowing that the saying goes, "A virtuous woman does not marry two husbands," after some discussion, it was decided to fight Shangzhong teachers to the death this Sunday (the 28th) at 5:00 PM. The Yangjing team is made up of students, so we will not accompany them. As for the competition rules, except that the time will be extended to sixty minutes (the veteran team usually plays for forty minutes), all other rules will follow the precedent of the Ministry of Education competition, wearing rubber shoes and using a size four ball. All comrades must meet at the city stadium at 4:00 PM that afternoon.</p>
<h3>Our Lineup</h3>
<p>Hu Zongfan, Wang Eming, Zhang Xiankang, Pei Shunyuan, Xia Kaiming, Ji Zhizhong, Qu Yue, Shen Meizhen, Sun Daosheng, Teng Shugu, Jiang Huaiqing</p>
<p>Reinforcements: Shen Zhenchao, Xu Shoulian</p>

<h3>Thoughts Inspired by "Duck Stuffing"</h3>
<p>- Shi Shi</p>
<p>The other night, a friend hosted a dinner at a Tianjin-style restaurant. Because most of the guests were schoolteachers used to eating chalk dust, the conversation often turned to education, even from unrelated topics. Although this was inevitable, it was "sticking to one's trade," discussing personal experiences is always more relatable than other topics.</p>
<p>When the wine was half-drunk, the waiter brought a fat roast duck skewered on a wooden fork, presented it to the guests, and asked for their appraisal. Then, standing to the side, he began to carve, sending slices to the table one after another. The flavor was indeed good, fragrant and crispy, and everyone praised it.</p>
<p>A certain gentleman who claimed to be a "gastronomic doctor" said with certainty, "This is true duck stuffing, definitely not a fake. Because the duck skin is oily and fat, and the duck meat is fragrant and crispy, these are definite proofs of the genuine product." He then skillfully told us about the method of making duck stuffing. It is said that duck stuffing is entirely the result of artificial modification. In the Pingjin area, there are many large-scale duck stuffing factories that purchase large quantities of ducks from various ports every spring. Initially, they are fed ordinary food. When it is time to implement the stuffing, a certain medicine is first used to eliminate accumulated food. Then, a specially prepared food is used to forcefully stuff the duck's belly as much as possible until its capacity is at its extreme. They are then confined to a dark room with a suitable temperature, to prevent excretion, without giving them drinks, or exposing them to sunlight, and allowed to lie stiff for several days. As the food gradually digests and becomes a large amount of nutrient, they are forced to form a deformed development. In a short period, they become a strangely fat, tender duck stuffing.</p>
<p>"This is such a symbolic thing!" A certain Mr. who had been a teacher for ten years, seemed to be touched by the duck stuffing, sighed and said, "Are we not doing the work of duck stuffing all day long in education? Are not the big and small schools established in society all duck stuffing factories? The teachers are squeezing a group of so-called 'knowledge' food into the students' stomachs. Who cares about the students' appetite or whether they can accommodate this kind of food? Who cares about the current era and society, or whether there is a need for this kind of food? Can it be adapted? Teachers are only committed to stuffing for a certain period. When the students' stomachs are full, they have fulfilled their only responsibility. Is this not the same as the duck stuffing worker's job of stuffing the ducks to make them bigger? As for the parents who rush to send their children to school, the purpose is only to hope that their children's stomachs are stuffed with more things, to obtain a gilded qualification or a silver title, which can increase their value in a commercialized society. What is the difference between this and the duck owner sending the ducks to the duck stuffing factory to be raised fat and tender in order to sell them at a good price in the market?"</p>
<p>Everyone laughed at Mr. 's words, but I could not help but fall into contemplation. At the same time, I felt a kind of sorrow beyond emptiness for the entire education problem of the present era. This duck stuffing analogy may be a bit too harsh, but the iron-like reality is clearly placed before our eyes. Can we find a reason to prove that this is just a ridiculous "joke?"</p>
<h3>Small Tyrant (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Bing Xin</p>
<p>Every day he had to come to our house to play. Sometimes, when friends came, we would buy some peanuts to entertain them, and he would always look at us with longing. So, we gradually went from giving him candy to get rid of him to ordering, "Go away!" He didn't mind. He would run out immediately after hearing us, but would come back in two or three minutes.</p>
<p>"This little tyrant is really annoying!" As long as we said this, he would immediately be offended, give us a fierce look, and walk away. So, we often used this method to drive him away. It's pitiful that he has to endure these insults because of his father's influence.</p>
<p>One day, I was practicing shooting targets upstairs alone. As soon as the gunshot rang, he shouted, "Bang, bang!" While shouting, he walked upstairs with another child of seven or eight years old. Every time I fired a shot, he shouted. After the five bullets were gone, I asked him, "Are you afraid when I shoot?"</p>
<p>"No, I'm not afraid."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"Just because."</p>
<p>"Do you think shooting is good or bad?"</p>
<p>"Bad."</p>
<p>"Why is it bad?"</p>
<p>"If you say it's good, I'll say it's bad."</p>
<p>"Why do you want to say it's bad?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. I just know shooting is bad."</p>
<p>This answer made me both amused and annoyed. Unfortunately, these words came from him—a little tyrant whom no one paid attention to and everyone disliked. If George Bernard Shaw had said it, it would have been widely reported in newspapers and magazines.</p>
<p>He could speak several sentences of Mandarin, which made me very ashamed. I'd been here for three months and still couldn't speak a word of the local dialect. Several times, he acted as a translator when I spoke to his mother. Gradually, I didn't dislike him so much, because every time I came back from outside, he would greet me warmly, "Miss, you're back!" Sometimes, I would deliberately ask him in the local dialect, "Have you eaten?" "I have eaten. Have you eaten?" Unexpectedly, he answered me in fluent Mandarin.</p>
<p>He didn't go out to play much, perhaps because he was afraid other children would call him a little tyrant. He spent all day in the yard tossing small stones into the air, sometimes shouting loudly, "Fire! Bang, bang, bang!" One spring afternoon, I was lying in bed taking a nap when I suddenly heard shouting downstairs, "Charge! Kill! Kill! Kill!" I thought some children were practicing military exercises, so I quickly got up to take a look. It turned out that only the little tyrant was there giving orders to himself, blowing his own bugle, and firing his own gun.</p>
<p>"Hey, what are you doing?"</p>
<p>"Fighting," he replied immediately.</p>
<p>"Fighting with whom?"</p>
<p>"With the enemy."</p>
<p>"Who is the enemy?"</p>
<p>"It's me."</p>
<p>How humorous! He was fighting himself!</p>
<p>People's feelings are governed by their thoughts. We never had good feelings towards the little tyrant or his mother. I remember once, Shu and I went to her garden and pulled out two big carrots without telling her, and said, "What does it matter?" She often quarreled with a very poor old woman in the same house, and every time she scolded the old woman until tears streamed down her face. Naturally, we sympathized with the old woman and hated the tyrant's wife. Her main room was filled with dozens of gilded ancestral tablets and hung with gilded plaques and victory reports, but cobwebs covered these things. The main room was filled with broken furniture, and chicken, duck, rabbit, and dog droppings were everywhere. Five years ago, she was a dignified and awe-inspiring tyrant, but now she has been reduced to a broken home and family, an unbearable memory. Alas, this is the evolution of the times, this is their due fate. (Night of May 13, 1933)</p>
<h3>Ramblings from a Thatched Hut</h3>
<p>— Zi Zhan</p>
<p>(33) The Scholar's Misfortune</p>
<p>Alas! At the beginning of the Southern Song Dynasty, when Qin Hui advocated peace and sold out the country, public opinion was in an uproar, and many were impeached, how pitiful! Finally, thanks to Emperor Xiaozong not punishing reckless words, scholars avoided a major disaster. Although foreign troubles were said to be increasingly urgent, the national destiny was held and slightly extended, which I have already briefly mentioned. I remember the beginning of *The Scholars*, which describes Wang Mian observing the celestial phenomena at night, seeing the Guansuo star infringing on the Wenchang star, and sighing that a generation of literati was in trouble. Although this is a novelist's statement, it is not far from historical facts. When the Ming Dynasty was founded, Zhu Yuanzhang, skilled in opportunism, used peasant forces, aided by literati's wit, to seize the fruits of revolution. He knew that peasants were easy to deceive, but literati were difficult to control. Therefore, he repeatedly stirred up literary inquisitions, humiliated literati, and suppressed their spirit, and even made it a constitutional law for his descendants. Once, in the second year of Hongwu, he ordered the establishment of schools throughout the country, and ordered the Ministry of Rites to issue a decree and carve it into a "lying tablet" with twelve articles. The most important were two: first, the state selects scholars through the classics, and those who explain the classics should take the commentaries of Song Confucian scholars as the standard, and the writing should be based on classical and pure style. From now on, it is necessary to issue the *Four Books*, *Five Classics*, *The Nature of Principle*, *Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Government*, *Extended Meaning of the Great Learning*, *Memorials of Famous Ministers of Past Dynasties*, *Orthodox Writing*, and books such as the *Edicts and Statutes of Past Dynasties*, and order students to explain them. Those who plagiarize heresies and show off their strangeness, even if their writing is skillful, will not be recorded. Thus, scholars, under the coercive power of unified thought, have no freedom of academic thought. Second, everyone in the world is allowed to speak frankly about the ills of the country, but students are not. From now on, if students have personal matters, they are allowed to have their family members report them. If it does not concern themselves, they should not go to government offices at will. If their behavior is flawed, they will be expelled. If they incite the masses to riot and scold officials, the leaders will be sent away, and the rest will be reduced to commoners. Thus, scholars, under the coercive power of prohibiting interference in politics, have no freedom of speech or action. However, the literati of the world could not endure this forever without fighting for freedom. Therefore, the Donglin Society and the Fushe Society arose one after another, criticizing the government and attacking corrupt officials. However, the government's oppression became even more severe, to the point of not hesitating to give away all the land outside the pass and in northern China to the enemy, but refusing to relax even one step on the literati. Before the party prison ended, the small court of Nanjing fell. Unexpectedly, the Manchus, replacing the Ming Dynasty, followed its old tricks, restricting scholars and enacting stricter laws. In the ninth year of Shunzhi, the Ministry of Rites presented eight articles to be followed and carved them into the "New Lying Tablet" in the school palaces. It restricted the intelligence of literati and imprisoned their thoughts. The last two articles were particularly cruel. First, students are not allowed to submit memorials to the emperor about the benefits and harms of the military and the people. If they offer any advice, they will be treated as violating the system, dismissed, and punished. This restriction on freedom of speech is even greater than that of the Ming Dynasty. Second, students are not allowed to form parties with many people, form alliances, or control the government and bully the countryside. They are not allowed to rashly print their writings. Violators will be punished by the supervisory officials. Thus, there is no freedom of assembly, association, or publication. Moreover, during the reigns of Kangxi and Qianlong, there were frequent literary inquisitions. Therefore, literati followed each other in textual research, called it Han learning, to express their thoughts and exhaust their wisdom. However, the extreme of textual research led to heresy and doubting the classics, and then there was Kang Youwei's *Confucius as a Reformer* and *Study of the Forged Classics of the Xin Dynasty*. Finally, it aroused the Reform Movement. Although the scholars did not rebel, the candidates for the imperial examinations openly submitted memorials. Then there was the revolutionary movement, and the party members were not completely slaughtered, and the Republic of China was actually seen. Alas! The First Emperor of Qin burned books and buried scholars alive, and Qin perished in the second generation. In the late Ming and Qing dynasties, the persecution of literati became even more severe, and the speed of their demise became even faster. The predecessors had no time to lament for themselves, but the descendants lamented for them. This is why the "Alas" school of historians always holds the "Alas"!</p>

<h3>Red Carrot Whiskers</h3>
<p>— Written by Jules Renard, Translated by Lin Qu</p>
<p>Red Cheeks Three (Continued)</p>
<p>"Sir, the dormitory master has a personal grudge against me!" Red Carrot Whiskers said.</p>
<p>"Ah! He has a personal grudge against you! Giving you eight days of detention, my child!"</p>
<p>Red Carrot Whiskers knew the other party's nature. Such mild treatment did not surprise him at all. He had decided to risk everything. He adopted a stubborn posture, his legs close together, not even caring if he got a slap.</p>
<p>Often using the palm of the hand to punish a stubborn student was an indisputable habit of the headmaster. If the targeted student was nimble, he would lower his head before the slap reached his face, making the headmaster stagger a few steps, causing everyone to hold back their laughter. Then the headmaster would not come again, because he had to maintain his dignity and could not use cunning like a student. He had to hit the chosen cheek in one blow, or let it go.</p>
<p>"Sir," Red Carrot Whiskers said boldly and proudly, "the dormitory master and Ms. Suo have done some ambiguous things!" The headmaster's eyes suddenly became blurred, as if two small flies had suddenly flown in. He put his tightly clenched fists on the edge of the desk, raised his body halfway, and stretched his head forward, as if he wanted to collide with Red Carrot Whiskers. He asked in a deep, hoarse voice:</p>
<p>"What ambiguous things?"</p>
<p>With this question, Red Carrot Whiskers became at a loss. He thought the headmaster would use a clever move to throw a very thick book, like Martin's (HMARTIN, a famous French historian) works, at his face, but he didn't expect the headmaster to ask him for details.</p>
<p>The headmaster waited for him to answer. The wrinkles on his neck had all closed together into a whole meat hoop, a thick, round circle of skin, with his head crookedly placed on top.</p>
<p>Red Carrot Whiskers hesitated, but when he wanted to confirm that he had not said anything wrong, he could not say why. Then, his face suddenly became ambiguous, and he bent his back, looking obviously clumsy and embarrassed. He pulled out his flattened hat from between his legs, bent his body even more severely, and shrank. He slowly raised the hat to chin height, and then slowly, insidiously, with a disdainful expression, he buried his ape-like head in the cotton-padded hat, without saying a word.</p>
<p>Four</p>
<p>That day, after a brief investigation, Wei Aolong was fired! The scene when he left was very touching, almost like a farewell party.</p>
<p>"I'll be back again," Wei Aolong said, "this is just a temporary departure."</p>
<p>But these were lies. The academy authorities regarded him as mold and had already appointed someone else to his position. This was just a matter of one dormitory master coming and another going. He left here like other dormitory masters, but he was better than them because he left faster. Almost all the students liked him. They had never met a second person with his skill in writing exercise book covers, such as "So-and-so's Greek Exercise Book." He wrote the first letter in a sign-painting style. The students left their seats and surrounded his desk. His beautiful hand, wearing a green gemstone ring, moved elegantly on the paper. He temporarily created a signature pattern for others at the bottom of the exercise book cover. It was like a stone falling into the water, with waves and eddies all around. These waves and eddies were composed of regular, yet unusually graceful, ink lines, which were the final strokes of the signature. It was truly a small masterpiece. The end of the last stroke disappeared into the chaotic mess, and it could not be found without looking very closely and spending a lot of time searching. Needless to say, all of this was done in one stroke. Once, he drew the ink lines into a chaotic mess and called it an end-of-volume illustration, which made the children marvel for a long time.

<p>Financial Gold Price Drops Again by Five Yuan, Market Supply and Demand in Balance, Process Still Wavering</p>
<p>The gold market continued to fall yesterday. The process was mediocre. The supply and demand sides in the market were balanced. Therefore, it was wavering and uncertain throughout the day.

<h3>Securities and Bond Market Shows a Smart Trend in the Ordinary</h3>
<p>The May futures delivery is closed today.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market of the Chinese Securities Exchange was still very mediocre, and the trend was firm. The buying and selling of July futures has already started on the market, but it has not been started at all. Although the initial step of peace has been laid, it is uncertain whether the subsequent negotiations will go smoothly, and there will inevitably be changes in the process. The danger in Pingjin has been temporarily resolved, and the war in various places has not completely stopped. The major players in the market are still selling, but the market price is recovering due to the strictness of scattered needs. In the morning, the first plate, the opening number 18, slightly omitted 1 or 2 jiao, and the rest still rose by 2 or 3 jiao. Fengshui tax rose only 1 jiao and 5 fen because No. 46 was still selling. The second plate unanimously returned small, about 1 jiao to 3 jiao. After the afternoon opening, the listed types still continued small 1 or 2 jiao. After entering the market, starting from the 20-year treasury bonds, it rose again by 1 jiao to 2 jiao and 5 fen. Closing price 46 stopped selling, and the bond markets still rose by 2 or 3 jiao due to scattered needs. As a result, it rose by 1 jiao to 4 jiao and 5 fen, only 18 Guan was a small 3 jiao, and the whole 6 was a small 5 fen. The trend was stable, without much honor or disgrace. It is because the market was closed today due to delivery, and the Dragon Boat Festival will be supplemented next Monday, so new trading is gradually becoming scarce, and the market is mostly closing transactions. The total number of transactions was 6,917,000 yuan, including 7,000 yuan in spot goods and 2,875,000 yuan in futures of unified salt tax, the transaction of the 20th Guan was also not quiet, with 1,155,000 yuan, 980,000 in disarmament, and the rest ranged from 30,000 to 400,000 to 500,000.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Slightly Decline</h3>
<p>The yarn market fell slightly. Factories do not care about loosening yarn prices due to high costs, and most factories are short of raw materials and continue to reduce working hours. Therefore, a certain major player has a strong intention to go long, but general shorts view the actual demand as weak, and the pressure is still strong. However, the cotton market is strong, and there is no reason for the yarn price to fall sharply.</p>
<h3>Human Fiber Still Stable</h3>
<p>Before the market opened, the Human Fiber price was stable, with American cotton prices steady. Market conditions were calm, with prices for each month falling by 3.4.5.6 cents. The market opened in the afternoon, and confidence remained weak. However, prices rebounded slightly by the closing bell. Ultimately, near and far months rose by 1.2 cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 20,500 bales. Longfeng sold 1,000 bales, Chunji 750 bales, Lichang 450 bales, Rongxing 500 bales, Yuande 500 bales, and Taichang 450 bales. Gengfeng bought 1,200 bales, Renfeng 1,050 bales, and Yongchang 650 bales. Closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Human Fiber Closing Prices, Change, and Open Interest</p>
<p>August: 19.65, down 5, 61,005</p>
<p>May: 19.00, down 1, 15,850</p>
<p>September: 19.78, up 2, 46,600</p>
<p>June: 19.22, up 2, 46,750</p>
<p>October: 19.81, up 16, 39,500</p>
<p>July: 19.40, up 6, 64,550</p>
<p>Total: 274,250</p>
<h3>Yarn Sales Still Good</h3>
<p>Current yarn sales remain good. Daily purchases from various groups totaled 840 bales. Market conditions were similar to the previous day. Purchase amounts by group are as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong: 425, Inland: 350, Fellow Traders: 90, Yunnan: 130, Luzhou: 10, Houmen: 10, Ningbo: 25, Tianjin: 5, Nanjing: 10, Sichuan: 50. The cotton market fell in the morning and rose in the afternoon, but the situation remains firm. This is because the American and Indian cotton markets are stable, and the existing cotton supply is becoming scarce. Sources are very rare, so speculators are inclined to buy long. However, some are selling short due to high prices. Nevertheless, with overseas cotton markets trending upward, it will be difficult for Chinese cotton to trend downward.</p>
<h3>Zheng Fiber Fell in Morning, Rebounded in Afternoon</h3>
<p>Before the market opened for Zheng Fiber, market sentiment was steady. There were still transactions for near-month delivery up to the second and third sessions. Market prices were slightly lower, affecting far-month prices. Prices for each month fell by 3.4 cents. In the afternoon, it was reported that a certain merchant still had good demand for spot cotton, and market sentiment rebounded. Prices for each month rose by 0.5 to 1.5 cents. Total transaction volume for the day was 64,900 piculs. Yifeng sold 4,100 piculs, Yuanxing 4,000 piculs, Yuchang 3,600 piculs, Chunji 2,900 piculs, and Changfeng 1,700 piculs. Dafu bought 4,400 piculs, Xincheng 2,200 piculs, Hengyi 2,000 piculs, Tongfu 1,700 piculs, and Changfeng 1,100 piculs. Closing prices are as follows:</p>

<p>Total: 535,400</p>
<p>July: 46.70, up 3, 148,500</p>
<h3>Raw Cotton Mill Demand Average</h3>
<p>Spot cotton transactions are average, but a certain merchant and mill purchased more. Sources included 110 bales of Yaohua cotton.</p>
<p>Tianjin American Cotton: 48.00, Dacheng Imports 119 pieces, warehouse delivery.</p>
<p>Rangoon Cotton: 45.25, Hengfeng Imports 300 pieces, delivered to the factory.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Japanese Mills Export Yarn to Japan</h3>
<p>Shanghai Japanese mills' yarn prices have soared by more than ten yuan recently due to the rising prices of "Sanpin" yarn (three-brand yarn). Japanese domestic cotton merchants, feeling that Shanghai Japanese yarn is cheaper than domestic yarn, have been successively purchasing from Shanghai. It is reported that several hundred bales were traded on the 16th, including 16s and 20s counts. The transportation of Shanghai Japanese merchant cotton yarn to Japan is a rare phenomenon in recent times. If the "Sanpin" market situation is bullish and the exchange rate is favorable, the export of Japanese yarn to Japan will gradually become prosperous. Therefore, various Shanghai Japanese mills have high hopes for this trend.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Rises Spot, Falls Futures</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially rose due to favorable Liverpool news and strength on Wall Street. However, the market weakened later, and as a result, spot prices rose by 10 points, while futures prices fell by 1 to 3 points. Liverpool cotton spot prices rose by 13 points, and futures prices rose by 14 to 16 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 14 points. The Bombay cotton market was firm at the close due to purchases by a few Japanese merchants and retail investors. As a result, Omra rose by 3.5 rupees, and Pingar and White Western both rose by 4.5 rupees. Original telegram on the left (dated May 24):</p>

<h3>Silk, Tea, Cocoon News Combined with Silk Market Notes</h3>
<h3>New Cocoons from Fuyang Enter the Market</h3>
<p>In Fuyang, Tangjiabu, Shuxi, and other places, the early native spring silkworm crops suffered damage due to the weather and completely failed. Fortunately, the improved breeds raised as replacements developed smoothly due to sunny and warm weather. The new cocoons are now entering the market. Few cocoon merchants have opened scales. The initial price was 26-27 yuan, then rose to 30 yuan. Yesterday, high-quality cocoons were expected to rise to 32-33 yuan.</p>
<h3>Haining Foreign Breed Cocoons Surge</h3>
<p>In Haining, 80-90% of farmers raise foreign breeds. The new cocoons have entered the market, with a harvest of 60-70%. Only three cocoon merchants have opened scales. The foreign breed cocoons are of the best quality and command higher prices. The initial price for ordinary cocoons was 25-28 yuan, and improved breed cocoons were 32-33 yuan. Subsequently, due to limited arrivals, cocoon prices surged. High-quality improved breed cocoons have risen to 37-38 yuan, and some are even selling for 40 yuan.</p>
<h3>Pinghu Early Silkworms Are Thriving</h3>
<p>In Pinghu, XinDai, and other places, although this year's silkworm rearing is inferior to previous years, 80-90% of farmers are raising improved breeds. The early crops have entered their final molt and are thriving. Some are already spinning cocoons, while others are in the final stage of their third molt. The late crops have also completed their third molt and are being released. In a few days, the new cocoons will be on the market. Leaf prices are less than one yuan.</p>
<h3>Jingjiang Uneven Molting</h3>
<p>In Jingjiang, there is a significant difference between the success of early and late silkworm crops. Feeding is not smooth, with both foreign and native breeds being raised. The early crops have entered their final molt, the slightly earlier crops are being released, and the late crops are still in their third molt or just beginning to molt.</p>
<h3>Rayon Prices Are Calm</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the influence of the situation in Northeast China, all areas have been almost completely invaded by Japanese rayon sales. Furthermore, the Sichuan group's sales have stagnated due to the war. Silk fabrics in Jiangsu and Zhejiang are overstocked, and there is no demand for rayon raw materials. Yesterday, only Shanghai silk factories imported twelve cases of Jin Qilin, Hei Meiren, and other brands of current and forward goods, at a net price of 182 yuan.</p>
<h3>Factory Dealer Telegram Prices Down Slightly by Ten Yuan</h3>
<p>In the past two days, overseas Japanese silk prices have frequently fallen, but European and American telegram prices from Huangbai factory dealers have instead decreased slightly by ten yuan. Various manufacturers are exporting old factory silk, and the government is subsidizing each bale with 140 yuan in Jiangsu-Zhejiang silk industry public bonds. Since the deadline is approaching at the end of this month, they are actively selling off. Transactions for Chen silk Bai factory silk are not weak. Lanlebi (Meizhuang) imported 100 bales of 75-degree evenness, and Xinfu (French Zhuang) and Anli (British Zhuang) also imported 60 bales. In addition, 28 bales of Sichuan Huang factory silk and 5 bales of coarse yellow silk were traded, with prices generally flat and weak.</p>
<h3>Qimen Black Tea Sales Stagnant, Prices Low</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the outlet for Qimen black tea remained sluggish. Only Jinlong, Yihe, and other firms slightly increased their purchases of upper and middle class goods. Selling prices continued to fall by more than ten yuan. Yihe foreign firm opened the price for HeKou black tea at 55 yuan, also lower by one-third.</p>
<h3>Wuyuan New Tea Opens Its Scales for the First Time</h3>
<p>New tea from various villages in Wuyuan has recently been harvested one after another. In previous years, tea firms would start collecting and purchasing before the tea was finished. However, now that the tea harvesting season has arrived, the firms have not yet left their villages. The coldness of the market atmosphere is unprecedented. For a long time, the Shanghai market price for new tea opened low, and mountain prices were not easily determined. However, tea firms that generally tend to be enthusiastic have changed their minds. A few days ago, they sent personnel out to explore the market. Yesterday, a small number opened their scales on both the north and south routes. Kaoshui opened sales at 39 yuan (16-tael scale), Shijing at 40 yuan, and Shangkeng at 45 yuan, all lower than last year by 10-20 yuan. Other firms are therefore also following the market and searching for supplies. It is expected that large numbers will open their scales in the next two days.</p>
<h3>Grain: River Rice Arrivals Scarce, Prices Up Two Cents</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, sources included more than 20 firms from Changshu, Southern Jiangsu, Nanhonggang, Qingjiao, Songjiang, Western Lian, and Pinghu. Southern Gang thick japonica rice and special grade Zhongguan thin rice continued to be purchased by shops on this street. Therefore, the initial market saw tightened sentiment due to cloudy weather. Later, because there were few arrivals, the market became more active, and prices rose sharply. Thick japonica rice rose by two cents, and special grade Zhongguan thin rice rose by three cents. As for Songjiang and Qingjiao premium thin rice, the entire city relied on only ten loads, all destined for Beijing and Weihaiwei. Sellers, seeing Zhongguan goods and others selling quickly, vigorously raised prices, but buyers resisted strictly, resulting in a rise of only one cent. Duyang tip rice also showed a slight increase of half a cent. Bianyuan felt slightly recovered, while Yin yuan remained soft.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the weather was cloudy and humid. River sources numbered fifty-six ships. Purchases of white japonica rice were slightly depleted, and the market was generally tight, with near-term prices inching up. Early thin rice arrivals were few and sales were average, with prices increasing by several points. Sheep Duyang tip rice also showed signs of tightness, while Baiyuan was flat.</p>
<h3>Ke Xian Rice Tight, Foreign Rice from Fujian Shows Activity</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Fuzhou firms were eager to purchase, and all grades of Ke Xian rice were tight, especially brown rice. Prices rose steadily by seven-tenths. Demand for foreign rice from Ningbo was also strong, and foreign firms quoted prices but did not sell. Later, 900 bales of return goods were sold, but the price remained at 7.7 yuan. Ke Xian brown rice was all purchased by Fujian firms. 672 bales of late Jiangxi machine-milled rice were traded at prices ranging from 8.57 yuan to 8.2 yuan, 170 bales of early machine-milled rice were traded at a price of 7.65 yuan, 240 bales of Hunan machine-milled red rice were traded at a price of 8.11 yuan, 624 bales of brown red rice were traded at a price of 7.21 yuan, and 1,000 bales of brown oil rice were traded at prices ranging from 7.5 yuan to 7.37 yuan. There were no other imports or exports. There were few arrivals. If the Fujian market becomes smoother, the market will gradually improve.</p>
<h3>Rapid Advance and Sharp Retreat in Bran Powder and Wheat</h3>
<p>The flour market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon. At the opening of the market in the morning, sentiment was very good due to the previous day's price increases. Foreign wheat also rose by five or six cents, and the market atmosphere was very strong. Prices for all months rose uniformly, ranging from slightly more than one cent to several li. However, because large and small factories had sufficient inventory and more foreign wheat was arriving, they took the opportunity to sell. Inland firms also vigorously sold in the market because of clear weather and the expectation of a bountiful harvest of new wheat. Buyers also became wary, and the market gradually declined. Closing prices were down by 0.75 for the current month, down by 1.25 for the next month, down by 0.75 for July, down by 0.5 li for August, unchanged for September, and down by 0.25 for October.</p>
<p>The wheat market was very active, and fresh wheat had also recently arrived. 350 bales of Shi wheat were sold in the market at a price of 4.375 yuan, 0.125 yuan higher than last week's selling price. Also, because foreign wheat was reported to be high, sentiment was very good. After the wheat market opened, all prices rose. October increased by as much as nine points, and the rest increased by two, three, or four points. In the afternoon, traders sold off, and prices suddenly fell again. Closing prices for July and September were each down by one point, August was up by one point, and the rest were unchanged.</p>
<h3>Cake Sales Active, Soybean Market Soars</h3>
<p>Although yesterday's soybean cake market saw few transactions, the market was quite tight. This is because there have been few arrivals of customer cakes recently, and they are sold out immediately upon arrival. Therefore, factory cakes have good sales, and the market is improving, which has smoothed the demand for soybean purchasing. As a result, the market soared. Yesterday, six cartloads of Zhengyangguan soybeans were purchased, rising by three or four points. Other soybeans also rose by two or three points.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Xiamen Tangerine Cakes Long Out of Stock, Prices Rise Slightly</h3>
<p>Xiamen tangerine cakes were previously reduced from 19 taels to 18 taels. As a result, prices were difficult to agree on, and there have been no continued arrivals. It is now found that the firms' goods have been exhausted, and the remaining stocks of each company are limited. The firm's asking price is three or four qian higher, and the market trend seems to be tightening. It is also heard that factory cake prices are unlikely to loosen.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Thin Tinplate Arrivals Surge, Sales Stagnant</p>
<p>35-pound thin tinplate previously saw rising standards due to scarce goods and bustling sales, reaching up to 54 yuan per box. Recent transactions, however, have become sluggish due to the approaching mold season. Customer groups and factories have no need for it. However, arrivals have come one after another. As a result, standards have loosened. The asking price is 50 yuan per box, slightly lower than before by 2 yuan. However, recently, foreign firms' spot goods and brokerage road goods have been actively marketed. With more sellers and fewer buyers, the asking price is 49 yuan per box. Yesterday's transactions amounted to only 20-30 boxes.</p>

<h3>Anti-Aircraft Arrows</h3>
<p>— Ox</p>
<p>Airplanes, artillery, and tanks are the most important weapons of modern warfare. Among these weapons, airplanes are especially important because they can move freely back and forth, fire from the air, and when bombs fall, both jade and stone are destroyed. Their destructive power is extremely cruel.</p>
<p>Therefore, countries are now desperately developing their air forces, preparing their strength. The cruelty and brutality of future battles will be hundreds of times greater than before. Although airplanes had already been invented during the European War, there were not many of them, so their destructive capacity was not very severe. In recent years, military experts in various countries have concluded from their research that airplanes are extremely effective in combat. Therefore, countries are increasing them in large quantities.</p>
<p>However, while preparing an air force on one hand, on the other hand, there is a natural preparation for air raids. Defending against the air force is also crucial. But looking at the air defense equipment of various countries, in addition to anti-aircraft guns, there has been no mention of other excellent equipment. This is the sole problem for all nations' air defense. This is a major shortcoming that military experts and scientists are still researching and have not completed.</p>
<p>China's weaponry, apart from a few machine guns, originally had absolutely no artillery or tanks. Even the few imported airplanes were few in number. The three hundred airplanes in Guandong were only displayed as decorations and could not be used in combat. Therefore, they were all returned to the foreigners on September 18. Since then, the enemy has been rampant and unimpeded everywhere, as if entering an uninhibited state. They can take Fengtian if they want, Rehe if they want, and Pingjin if they want. Our country has absolutely no ability to resist. It's truly pitiful. It's not that the military leaders didn't resist, it's that our country's military equipment is pitifully lacking.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is now a desperate rush to embrace the Buddha's feet at the last minute, donating airplanes everywhere to establish an air force. But having airplanes is not the only useful thing, you also need people to fly them. During the January 28 Incident, our country also had multiple airplanes, some placed at Qiao, and some parked in Suzhou, but no one dared to fly them out to resist the enemy. In the end, a foreigner was sacrificed. It's both pitiful and laughable.</p>
<p>But it doesn't matter, although our country doesn't have airplanes, devices that are favorable for air defense are emerging in endlessly. The scientist in our country invented a flying thunder last year, and a scientist invented a flying arrow. Most have already been field-tested and have excellent results. According to a Hankou dispatch on the 22nd, another scientist in our country invented an anti-aircraft arrow. It's truly rare. This kind of continuous invention of air defense weapons means that when the enemy's airplanes come flying like dragonflies, there is truly nothing to fear. We guarantee that you won't be able to beat them into a messy defeat or make them flee with their heads in their hands. There is truly nothing to fear. This news is not my fabrication; there is a telegram as proof.</p>
<p>Wang Richang from Ezhou invented an anti-aircraft arrow. He test-fired it on the 22nd at an open area near the Nanyang Tobacco Factory in Hankou. Police representatives from the Sui district attended and observed. A total of two arrows were fired, with good results. The arrow is simple to manufacture and has powerful medicine. The altitude range is four thousand meters, and the air burst is thirty meters. Special Hankou dispatch on the 22nd.</p>
<p>[P Magic Weapon to Save the Country</p>
<p>— Qiran</p>
<p>The "magic weapon" referred to here is not the</p>
<p>illusion of a magician, but the "magic weapon" of life. To put it plainly, it is the "skill of making a living."</p>
<p>Living in this world, one need not read so many</p>
<p>books, nor need one write articles so well, but one must do one's best to study the magic weapon. Because with a magic weapon, one can do whatever one wants and achieve one's heart's desire. Otherwise, there will certainly be no happiness, and one may even not be able to find food, clothing, shelter, or transportation. The same goes for the people and the country.</p>
<p>With a magic weapon, a scholar can become a "master."</p>
<p>With a magic weapon, an official can become a "chief." With a magic weapon, a soldier can become a "commander." With a magic weapon, a businessman can become a capitalist. With a magic weapon, a farmer can become a big landlord. With a magic weapon, a worker can also become a capitalist. With a magic weapon, a beggar can become the head of beggars. With a magic weapon, a robber can become a king. With a magic weapon, a rogue can become the head of rogues. With a magic weapon, a monk or nun can become a grandmaster. In addition, such people as martial arts experts, physiognomists, and diviners all rely on magic weapons to survive. At the same time, a country with a magic weapon can also become a great power.</p>
<p>The stronger the magic weapon, the richer the harvest.</p>
<p>The weaker the magic weapon, the poorer the harvest. Therefore, masters, chiefs, commanders, capitalists, big landlords, heads, kings, grandmasters, etc., also have high and low ranks. The harvests of martial arts experts, physiognomists, and diviners also vary in quantity. At the same time, countries also differ in strength and second strength.</p>
<p>Therefore, if people want to become great masters, chiefs,</p>
<p>commanders, capitalists, big landlords, heads, kings, or grandmasters, they must first enrich their magic weapons. At the same time, if a country wants to be strong, it must also enrich its magic weapons.</p>
<p>A country is made up of people. Therefore, if the</p>
<p>people's magic weapons are strong, the country will also be strong. It is said that our country is now on the verge of destruction. If we want to save it, we must quickly enrich the people's magic weapons. To put it plainly, we should immediately find ways to expand our masters, chiefs, commanders, capitalists, big landlords, heads, kings, grandmasters, and other talents.</p>
<p>As for how to expand, we must ask many such</p>
<p>specialists to hold a grand conference.</p>

<h3>Following Mr. Jiamenglu's Poem in Praise of the Buddhist Association's Casting of a Bronze Bell for the Japanese Earthquake Memorial Hall, Four Quatrains, Following the Original Rhyme</h3>
<p>— Zhenqing</p>
<p>The stench of wind and rain forces people to come, and the opening of the war in Yanbei is alarming. The sound of the bell of one hundred and eight is still not extinguished. How pitiful are the lives of the people that have been destroyed.</p>
<p>How many men have died for their country. Who is the war criminal who caused this disaster? The pain of the constant overturning of the three armies is intensified. Bear to read the ancient battlefields of previous people.</p>
<p>Don't say that the evil of man is punished by heaven. Retribution is now lost in the dark. Buddhism is difficult to stop the cruel nature. The Sanskrit sound vibrates like thunder in vain.</p>
<p>Strong neighbors are inherently ferocious in appearance, and wind and waves arise everywhere. Even if the Pulao roars in the East China Sea, the beacons on the border will become more open.</p>
<h3>Guiying's Fate</h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>After Li the elder and madam Lu had completed their deal, they hid thirty bright silver dollars from Guiying, and left like a puff of smoke, with tears in their eyes.</p>
<p>Madam Lu turned around, looked at Guiying eating at the table, and felt a faint pang of sadness in her heart; but she thought, following me is better than following a begging man, isn't it?, and then she sized up Guiying: slender figure, pleasing face, although yellow, thin, and anemic, just needs some good food and she can become plump and radiant. Madam Lu loved her more and more, thinking this girl was really a good buy, and was unspeakably happy.</p>
<p>"Guiying, aren't you going to eat anymore?" Madam Lu saw Guiying throw down her chopsticks, looking around, and smiled at her. Guiying ignored Madam's kindness, frowned, and asked in a slightly hoarse voice:</p>
<p>"Where's my dad?"</p>
<p>"Your dad? Guiying, your dad doesn't have food to give you, or clothes to wear, what do you want him for? Look how good it is here, there's food to eat, clothes to wear, and tall western-style houses to live in..."</p>
<p>"Where's...Dad?" Guiying didn't listen to Madam's words at all, stamped her feet, rubbed her eyelids with her small hands, and cried.</p>
<p>"Where's Dad?"</p>
<p>Madam felt annoyed in her heart, and the smile on her face faded away, she spat at her fiercely: "Cheap thing, can't get enough to eat, cheap bones! Your dad sold you here!" Madam hit Guiying's forehead resentfully.</p>
<p>"Ah... Dad... ah":::</p>
<p>Although Guiying was a beggar, she had never seen such a ferocious face, or been beaten and scolded so fiercely; she knew even more that her dad had sold her, and she began to cry madly. This made Madam Lu even angrier, she thought "I paid money and still have to get angry, if I don't show this little rascal a little color, she won't know how powerful Madam is", and she raised the plaited rattan skin to threaten her.</p>
<p>"Cry again, I'll beat you to death, you cheap thing!"</p>
<p>Eight-year-old Guiying didn't understand what "I'll" meant, seeing Madam wanted to beat her in this fierce and evil way, she cried even louder, running towards the door while shouting "Dad", Madam caught up and grabbed her little neck with one hand, threw her into the room, and she tumbled. Madam Lu wished she could swallow her in one gulp, and raised the plaited rattan skin to beat her wildly.</p>
<p>The plaited rattan skin in Madam's hand broke, and Guiying was screaming like a pig being slaughtered, her voice hoarse, crawling on the ground, twitching and sobbing.</p>
<p>"Madam, calm down, the weather is so hot, getting sick isn't worth it! This cheap thing only has a beggar's life! Madam, go to the room, I'll bring you some face water, Madam, go to the room:" The old woman persuaded Madam to go inside, trying her best. "Cheap thing!"</p>
<p>The most important thing is to pull. The most important thing when holding a meeting to elect is to solicit votes. In general occasions, if you are an outsider or have already taken the stage, then you need to pull people to pull over groups, and support and follow. This method is also for mutual utilization, to ascend to the realm of officials together, and then to be leisurely and comfortable, changing this eternal life.</p>
<h3>The Trilogy of Pulling</h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>Prelude</p>
<p>Our esteemed nation is truly somewhat peculiar. Armies need to conscript soldiers, brothels need to solicit customers, and gentlemen wishing to ascend to officialdom need to solicit votes, solicit people, and solicit organizations. Taking the literal meaning, those who are pulled are in a position of being compelled, while those who do the pulling consider it a practical necessity, almost an unavoidable necessity. Thus, the character "pull" is specially enlarged and made particularly eye-catching in the dictionary, and the lively drama of pulling becomes particularly energetic and vivid.</p>
<p>Part One</p>
<p>It is said that our esteemed nation's army loves money above all else. Conscripting soldiers during military campaigns is still a trick of the trade. In the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, where transportation is relatively convenient, this practice is not as prevalent because they have trains and ships to transport troops, so there is no need for the clumsy labor of porters. However, in my native Hunan, according to what I have seen and heard, it was once extremely popular. As soon as the army arrived, the first thing, of course, was to solicit money and loans in various ways, followed by hiring porters. Because hiring porters requires paying some money, or it may not be enough, they simply resorted to forceful conscription, scaring rural villagers and women into screaming and fleeing. In the end, many were always dragged away. Some never returned, naturally elevated from porters to soldiers, fodder for cannons; others were wrongly killed by stray bullets behind the main force. When the revolutionary army passed through fifteen years ago, they said they would not conscript soldiers, which delighted the villagers and women. But when I returned last winter, I heard that the revolutionary army of recent years has also been conscripting soldiers, and even more severely. This is an enigmatic tune. How can a revolutionary army conscript soldiers?</p>
<p>Part Two</p>
<p>Before I arrived in Shanghai, I had long heard of the fame of the Qinglian Pavilion on Simalu (Fourth Road), saying that it was the only place to direct this second movement of mine. But after I arrived and went to visit, I had a feeling that "its reputation exceeds its reality." All I saw were Yangzhou girls with tied-up trousers. This was probably because the pavilion had been reorganized several times, and its business was declining daily, and because the authorities in the British concession were somewhat opposed to the rampant public prostitution and strictly enforced bans. Fortunately, the French Concession intends to continue the tradition. In the area around Dongxinqiao (East New Bridge) and Xinxinqiao (West New Bridge), whenever the sun sets and the red lights begin to shine, almost all the red and green girls are active, bewitching, coquettish, flirting with their eyes, and seducing customers in every way. Late at night, there are still many standing like cranes. They are not afraid of severe cold, scorching heat, heavy rain, or violent storms. This is because fate has destined them to suffer, or because they are inherently unattractive, or because they are old and faded. So, although they seduce customers in every possible way, they still cannot get customers who "please them." Therefore, they can only resort to the tactic of forceful pulling. How many passersby—fools or unsophisticated country folk—are set upon by several of them, stripped bare, their goal being the shiny silver dollars. They don't really care whether you want to release something or not. It is evident that their pulling is a kind of "suffering." But after all, it is a path we fear. Whenever I go to that place to visit friends and return at night, I always grab a friend to escort me, because I am afraid of that kind of pitiful trouble—being pulled.</p>
<p>Part Three</p>
<p>I appreciated this kind of tune when I was still in school. Every time the student union was reorganized, those classmates with political backgrounds were truly busy. A few days before, they would go from one dormitory to another, the purpose of which need not be elaborated. When it came time for the meeting, the sound of "help, help!" would often buzz in the ears of us fools. This was when the ballots were being distributed. But this famous tune is most popular in "officialdom," because in China, the only way to be human is to become an official, so as not to fail the seven-foot body. If one can "pull" and also be an "official," it is not difficult to progress from corruption, bribery, and embezzlement to the enjoyment of cars, Western-style houses, and embracing wives and concubines. Therefore, all compatriots love the "ivory of the..."</p>
<h3>Various Types of Characters in Shanghai Society</h3>
<p>— Shen Min</p>
<p>Old "Hu" Character</p>
<p>Shanghai society, where people from all directions gather, is full of things that are somewhat baffling. All kinds of jokes and strange tales happen there.</p>
<p>There are some bohemian friends who often refer to women as "this widowed old one," elderly women as "old crabs," and men as "old 'hu' characters." It is unknown who invented this strange expression, and it cannot be traced. Presumably, this "old 'hu' character" is skilled at fooling around with widowed old women, so he is called "old 'hu'." However, the term "old 'hu'" also carries a three-point meaning of jealousy, and there are other details involved. As for the word "character," it is often heard everywhere. "This type of character," "that type of character." I remember there was a great writer in the past called "Nine-Two Character." His works were very valuable. Therefore, the word "character" is used by both refined and common people. I will now vary it a bit. Someone named Zhang might use "Bow-Long Character." Someone named Li might use "Wood-Child Character." Someone named Yang might use "Wood-Easy Character." Someone named Yu might use "Man-Un Character." Someone named Tong might use "Circle-Lucky Character." Someone named Chen might use "Ear-East Character." This is a bit more expressive than the common people's way of saying "the Zhang family," "the Li family," and so on.</p>
<p>"Shou Tou" Character</p>
<p>A person who is simple-minded and stubborn is called a "shou tou" character. There are some wealthy but stingy friends who treat money as their life. They are reluctant to eat and reluctant to spend, only diligently and hurriedly accumulating fields, land, and houses for others, willingly giving all their property to their children and grandchildren to squander. They are truly working like oxen and horses for their children and grandchildren, suffering for a lifetime, and someone even bestows upon them the elegant title of "shou tou" character.</p>
<p>Slippery Character</p>
<p>The Shanghai area is the birthplace of slippery characters. Their thoughts and methods are different from the masses. They don't brag, but their income increases. They lavishly flatter, leading people into their trap. They are slippery-headed, slippery-handed, and slippery-footed, slipping wherever they go. When they can't slip any further, they will slip away. There are also some unscrupulous merchants who change the appearance of inferior goods and sell their slippery, low-quality goods, making slippery transactions. These slippery characters, who only care about immediate small gains and disregard the destruction of their families and the loss of their country, are insane merchants. It is unknown when they will stop being slippery.</p>
<p>"Eat Essence" Character</p>
<p>Only taking in and not giving out, only greedy for cheap things and unwilling to be fooled, are generally "eat essence" characters. Not only are they unwilling to open their wallets for public welfare, charity, or national salvation donations, but they also use their public office for private gain, extracting oil from the sweat and blood capital donated by others and filling their own pockets. There is also a type of person who exhausts the essence of the people's fat and blood, making the masses mentally exhausted and the countryside declining. They are profit-oriented and engage in bribery. These number one "eat essence" characters are probably registered, so no one dares to oppose them.</p>
<p>"Bian San" Character</p>
<p>The main camp of "bian san" characters is probably near Zhengjia Bridge. Their faces are like dried olives, their clothes are like shriveled lanterns, and their pockets are shriveled officials. Therefore, their elegant name is "bian san" character. There are several types of their work. One type relies on catching crickets and "picking up cigarette butts" to make a living. Another type relies on tailing people and begging for money. Another type relies on pulling rickshaws on both sides of the Wusong River to earn a copper coin. However, there are also not a few who rely on leftovers to make a living. Therefore, the servants who deliver meals in the package meal shops are very annoyed by these people, and they are angry but dare not speak out. If the remaining leftovers and leftovers on the carrying poles of the package meal delivery are not surrounded and emptied by them, it has never happened. Their mansions are mostly on the sides of streets, alleys, and lanes. In the summer, those who sleep in the open on both sides of the road are everywhere. Alas, in Shanghai, which is known as paradise, this is the scene.</p>

<h3>Is It Better to Go Back and Guard the Family Property?</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I am currently working in a bookstore, and my monthly salary is not high. Apart from my own expenses, I have no money to send back home. Because there have been many donations and levies recently, the family income does not meet the expenses, and there is no money to send to me. My family has more than 400 mu of inherited land. Selling the rent grain every year, according to the current situation, can get more than 2,000 yuan; there is no other liquid property at all. My eldest brother is serving in the military; family affairs are managed by my second brother. Recently, my second brother wrote a letter saying that the family burden is very heavy and difficult to cope with, and it is better to divide the family property and manage each person's share separately. My idea is to divide the family property into five shares, one for each brother, one for the parents, and use one share of the annual income to run local charitable undertakings; do you think that's right? If doing charitable things, what else is good to do? There is also the point that if the family property is divided, I will have to go home to manage family affairs. Wouldn't that mean giving up my job? How to solve these problems? Sir, your experience is very rich, please give me your advice. Respectfully waiting for your reply.</p>
<p>Long Changrui</p>
<p>Editor's note: Mr. Long's distribution of family property, which takes into account parents and society, is very insightful. It is hoped that you will discuss this with your virtuous brothers, and if you can obtain their consent, proceed accordingly, and you can also set a good example in the countryside. As for what kind of charitable undertakings to run, since you and your elder brother are not at home; and the amount of more than 400 yuan per year cannot independently create a new enterprise; you can entrust your second brother to manage it, but he must prepare a statement of accounts every year.</p>
<p>However, you said that after dividing the family property, you would go back to manage family affairs; this is absolutely not advisable. Not to mention that the annual income of more than 400 yuan is not enough for your expenses. Even if the income can maintain expenses, it is not feasible. A person should be self-reliant, and relying on the blessings of ancestors and fathers is not something a true man does. Fortunately, your parents are still healthy and can be entrusted to manage it, and in the future, your brother can also be entrusted to manage it on your behalf. After clearly defining the boundaries with each other, he will not refuse. Rather than not wanting the family property, one must not give up one's career.</p>

<h3>The Life of the Five Beauties (Continued 18)</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Sixteen Wine</p>
<p>Miss Liu fully understood that she could not lack them in her life, because they were, after all, her best patrons. Especially these high-ranking government officials and authorities in the banking world, she dared not allow herself to neglect them even slightly. So she had to re-dress herself, apply heavy rouge on her cheeks, somewhat concealing that frightening paleness. And in order to be even more moving, she put on the recently made imitation satin jacket, the high and large saddle collar that covered her ears. Due to the brilliance of the red satin lining, it reflected on her snow-white face, making it particularly rosy.</p>
<p>As she walked to the threshold of the outer room, Manager Gu was the first to see her, and quickly gave Minister Su a look, naturally telling him to stop talking, but Minister Su was very confident and nonchalant, making a flirtatious face at her while continuing to say to Manager Gu:</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter, everyone is family: : : Listen to me: China's affairs are absolutely not something you"</p>
<p>"I or a few others can manage well, nor can it become strong in a year or two. Don't look, China is vast and rich in resources, which foreigner doesn't want to come and take advantage of it? The Eight-Nation Alliance in the Qing Dynasty is the best proof. If we had really fought the foreign soldiers at that time, using guns and swords to resist the foreigners' cannons, think about it, China would have been destroyed long ago. Fortunately, we still negotiated peace at that time, relying entirely on diplomatic efforts, and finally managed to keep this old China until now. So those who recognize the situation are heroes. People like Li Hongzhang are ultimately rare talents." A full glass of wine was poured down his mouth.</p>
<p>Judging from Minister Su's demeanor, it was easy to know that he was very enthusiastic about national affairs. Even judging from his speaking ability, it was very rare. Undoubtedly, he was the most famous diplomat at the time. How many official documents and conditions involving foreigners had to be signed by him personally before they could take effect. What an important person he was. Miss Liu saw all this most clearly and secretly took pride in it, because upon careful reflection, she was the mistress of this leading Chinese figure, and she had even talked to him about such and such things on the bed several times. Especially the sentence he just said, "Everyone is family," it could be seen that he did not treat Miss Liu as an outsider, and could be said to be very fond of her. If things continued like this, she would inevitably be able to insert a foot into national affairs in the future.</p>
<p>As soon as she thought of this, she immediately felt very hopeful, so she sat back in her original position and quietly watched Minister Su's lips move.</p>
<p>"So, I think that judging from China's current position, we should do our best to promote Sino-Japanese friendship."</p>
<p>Of course, Japan will inevitably take some advantage of China, but if you want them to help us establish our country, you will inevitably have to spend a little." As he spoke, he picked up his wine glass and took another sip. Manager Gu also picked up a chopstick of sausage and sent it to his mouth. Saying</p>
<p>"What you said is very true. However, China's affairs are not easy to do. At present, when the general public hates Japan so much,"</p>
<p>If Sino-Japanese friendship is too loud, it may be inconvenient. For example, because of the Twenty-One Demands, Cao Rulin and Zhang Zongxiang were not beaten for nothing. Brother, do you think that's right?"</p>
<p>"Hum, isn't that right," Minister Su said, stroking the table with his fingers, "However, this cannot be generalized. You must know that the Twenty-One Demands were too humiliating and detrimental to the country. If Yuan Shikai hadn't wanted to be emperor, such a thing would not have happened."</p>
<p>This conversation continued for a long time, and those who listened inevitably became bored. Later, Miss Liu simply</p>
<p>Yawned once and twice.</p>
<p>Suddenly, there was a commotion outside the door, and someone was shouting loudly to come in. As a result, Wu Gui went out to buy...</p>

<h3>New Inventions in the Art of Makeup (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Xin Fu</p>
<p>Dedicated to Those with a Sense of Beauty</p>
<p>There is a makeup genius in Hollywood. Every year, movie stars and fashionable women flock to him for advice, as numerous as the sands of the Ganges River. Recently, he published an article on makeup in the World Film Series. I have translated it here and dedicated it to those who have a sense of beauty.</p>
<p>Now I have the opportunity to tell you why I invented the "harmonizing color" makeup method. This is a very interesting thing! My original goal was to create a makeup product that would allow women all over the world to transform themselves into beautiful women at will. In the past thirty years of experimentation, thousands upon thousands of women have come to me for advice every year, and I have tried my best to hide their original shortcomings and guide them to the path of perfection.</p>
<p>This was about ten years ago! One day, in a makeup room in a large film studio, I first used my long-studied "harmonizing color" to apply makeup to a famous star, and explained the wonders of this makeup technique to her. Because this was a new method, she seemed very skeptical. Later, after the makeup was finished, she ran to the brightly lit camera. The director noticed her radiant appearance and couldn't help but pay attention. When the camera started rolling, she herself seemed to realize that my experiment was successful. When the film was taken and sent to the projection room and projected on the screen, the beauty of the star's face was so natural and lovely that I myself couldn't help but be surprised, and I was confident that my invention was a success.</p>
<p>From then on, I extended the "harmonizing color" makeup to ordinary women. Although daily decoration and makeup in the studio are slightly different, the success is the same. Hollywood makeup uses makeup to enhance natural beauty. This makeup must have a very accurate harmony with the inherent color. Only after use can it seamlessly adhere to the original complexion and become a natural beauty. My makeup, even in sunlight, cannot be seen as artificial. Makeup is similar to portrait painting. The only condition is to express the shadows of the face. You must first have a rough shape, and then add color to make it even in depth and beautiful in style. Eyes, nose, and lips must all be taken into account, and there can be no negligence. For long faces, you should try to shorten their length. If it is a round face, you must make it oval, because oval faces are more beautiful. I think if you know the correct method, and the color of the selected makeup can be very harmonious with the original color on your face, then makeup is not a very difficult task. In other words, if the colors are not harmonious, no matter how skilled you are, the makeup will never be very natural. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "Revenge of the Rouge"</h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>This story tells of a strange gentleman renting a room in a girl's house. Many tragic cases of women being murdered occurred locally. Although the official investigation revealed that the murderer was a foreign madman, he could not be arrested. The strange gentleman fell in love with the girl. Her old lover, a newspaper reporter, was extremely angry. Coincidentally, her father suspected the gentleman, because not only did his appearance resemble the murderer publicly described by the authorities, but the time he went out every night was also close to the time the tragic cases occurred. The newspaper reporter used this suspicion as evidence and reported it to the authorities, but after being arrested, he escaped. Soon, he secretly arranged for the girl to go to the park, because a hooligan insulted her, and he killed the hooligan.</p>
<p>I have great doubts about this film. The script does not clearly indicate whether the gentleman died or not? Why didn't he kill the girl? What is the relationship between the appearance of the hooligan and the script? Why did he become the key to the ending? These points are really confusing.</p>
<p>In general, the director does have very lively methods. The entire film is extremely organized, and the use of numerous newspapers reporting on murder cases to introduce the gentleman is especially revealing of his clever thinking. The insertion of humor is also used to avoid making the audience feel bored, but there are also many shortcomings. For example, it is unreasonable that the gentleman can jump out of the window to escape, but cannot break his own handcuffs, and that the court is like a child's play. At the same time, he is too negligent in not trying to remedy the shortcomings of the script.</p>
<p>Technically, the photography is the best. The outlines of many scenes are full of artistic beauty, especially the overhead shots of the stairs. The light uses a lot of shadows, which helps a lot with the mysterious and tense colors. The setting is mediocre. The sound is also clear, but there is too much dialogue.</p>
<p>Arno Van Lo, who plays the gentleman, gives a very moving performance. His remorse after killing his old partner is even more profound and tragic. Such an actor who is good at expressing inner emotions is rare in British films.</p>
<p>Eija Abtthal Lahn, who plays the girl, is also very lively and innocent. She accurately portrays a vacillating female employee. The remaining supporting roles are mostly humorous, which is not uncommon.</p>
<p>Manly Beckford, Lee Si Lian, and Howard co-star in "The Secret of One," which opens today at Guanglu Lanxin. Although the plot is bizarre, it is still within the bounds of human nature, but the meaning is not much, at most it is to exonerate crime. The description of the boring newspaper reporter is not much different from the vulgar merchant. Recently, it has really been a mistake in the viewpoint of the film industry. At the same time, this film also mentions the detective's uselessness, and the main idea is not correct.</p>
<p>As for the songs and dances outside the film, they are similar to the last time, and there is nothing to talk about.</p>
<p>Audience Opinion</p>
<h3>Thoughts After Watching "Future"</h3>
<p>— Xu Hairong</p>
<p>Although the story of this film is very ordinary, the consciousness is extremely good. It exposes the flaws of modern women, and shows them a path to take. It is telling a group of women who love vanity, are not practical, only seek pleasure, rely on men, and are unwilling to work hard for independence, that they should have a thorough awakening. The feudal system has collapsed, the old ideas have been broken, and the times have progressed to a new trend that is different from the past. Women can no longer rely on men to live a comfortable and enjoyable life. If you are unwilling to work hard and do not seek self-reliance, then the result will inevitably cause you great pain. In recent years, the newspapers have frequently published news of men abandoning women and leaving them helpless. This is a very clear example. The facts are as solid as iron and are placed in front of you, and you cannot deny them. Ladies and gentlemen, wake up, you must not give up your responsibility anymore, you should take out your strength to work to seek your own independent living. If you don't believe my words, then please run to the center and take a look at this "Future."</p>
<p>Tianyi Company</p>
<h3>The Process of Filming "Vitality"</h3>
<p>— Jingzhu</p>
<p>Since the beginning of 1933, known as the "Film Year,"</p>
<p>the Chinese film scene has become lively and spirited, and its productions have shown the vigor of domestically produced films. Lianhua's "Three Modern Women" and "Morning in the Metropolis," and Mingxing's "Torrent," were nurtured in this atmosphere full of youthful energy. We know that these films have been warmly welcomed by the public because of their progressive consciousness and social educational significance. At the same time, the production of these films and the acquisition of good results have determined the future path that domestically produced films should take.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, Tianyi, one of the three giants</p>
<p>among Chinese film production companies, was of course "moved to action" and embarked on the path that domestic films should take!</p>
<p>In early spring, snowflakes drifted</p>
<p>in the air, and the weather was as cold as deep winter. In the small living room of Tianyi Company, the boss, Tang Xiaodan, and an external guest sat around and discussed for a long time, and then decided to film the new production "Vitality" (originally named "Female Engineer"), a "change of style."</p>
<p>Because "Vitality" is not only Tianyi's new work that represents a "change of style," but also Tianyi's major production in 1933, the boss himself took on the responsibility of directing, and decided that Chen Yumei and Yuan Meiyun would play the leading actresses, and Zhang Zhenduo would play the leading actor. The original theme was to promote women's employment and the radio industry, and the content originally included scenes such as a radio factory and a radio station. Later, because the radio factory was changed to a sewing factory, scenes such as the radio station were also cancelled. After two months of hard work and cooperation, this film was finally completed under the direction of Director Shao.</p>
<p>This is the process of filming "Vitality."</p>
<h3>Hollywood's Bicycle Craze</h3>
<p>— You Quan</p>
<p>Recently in Hollywood, many movie stars</p>
<p>like to ride bicycles, so many people in that area have suddenly become fond of riding bicycles. Social butterflies often ride bicycles at night, and it has almost become an object that everyone wants to compete for.</p>
<p>"I haven't seen such an enthusiastic situation since</p>
<p>Gao Erfu became popular." A secretary of a bicycle trade association said, "But this is certain. American manufacturers should make light and handy bicycles like those in Europe. This kind of bicycle is relatively easy to drive."</p>
<p>The stars who like to ride bicycles include the following:</p>
<p>Mrs. Rock (Davis), Joan Crawford, Mary Brian Weatherby, Helen Twelvetrees, Phyllis Liddy, Bebe Daniels, Warner Baxter, Walter Huston, Clark Gable, Loretta Young, Frank Fay, and John Bowers, etc. They ride in Hollywood, and also on the Malibu beach.</p>
<p>This kind of game has spread to Santa</p>
<p>Barbara. There, an eight-year-old athlete actually sold his pants to a seven-year-old friend in exchange for a bicycle. But this deal was cancelled by the seven-year-old child's grandmother, who called the police.</p>
<h3>Movie Novel Eternal Regret (THE WHITESISTER) 10</h3>
<p>— Si Ping</p>
<p>Giovanni took a glass of wine and offered it to her, but she refused.</p>
<p>"Giovanni, I—I can't—let all the past be as if it died yesterday," she said. Her voice trembled, and she sobbed and cried.</p>
<p>"Very well, my dear, I just thought you might still want to know that I still love you—I will always love you!" His arms ached to embrace her, to hold her tightly and cherish her. But biting his lip, he turned and quietly left. His coming and going seemed to break the ice that had blocked the lonely heart of the young girl. She wept bitterly in Mina's comforting embrace. At that moment, the old woman earnestly said that he would come back, and she felt that a sudden hope was spreading its wings again.</p>
<p>But the next day, the sound of affectionate footsteps could not be heard on the escalator. Instead, the sound of drums and the neat footsteps were</p>
<p>mingling with the shouts and cheers on the street below.</p>
<p>Mina explained to the startled girl that Italy had joined the war—she had seen the declaration of war on the bulletin board. All the soldiers were departing.</p>
<p>"Giovanni!" Angela suddenly woke up and shouted. "I must see him once!" She grabbed her shawl and ran down the long escalator, wanting to go to the street. But at the bottom of the escalator, another pair of legs was catching up like the wind. They met, breathless with joy.</p>
<p>"Are you leaving right away?" Angela asked after she caught her breath. When Giovanni nodded, she asked again, "Is this battle dangerous? Oh, dear! Can I help?"</p>
<p>"Do you have wine?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Yes—upstairs—someone gave it to me!" They ran up the escalator. Giovanni said humorously and solemnly that he didn't trust anyone else to come like this. But she asked him not to be suspicious, guaranteeing that she would not change her mind.</p>
<p>"You are a virtuous wife, my dear!" He raised his glass. "I toast to my bride, wearing a white wedding dress! My dear! I will definitely come back. Come back and marry you." He held her in his hungry arms.</p>
<p>"Yes—yes!" Angela replied repeatedly. (To be continued)</p>
