<h3>時評　動盪中之遠東政局有　丨美蘇復交後日本政策之前途丨</h3>
<p>自美國於本月十六日實行承認蘇維埃社會主義聯邦共和國以來。於是斷絶已十有六年之美蘇邦交。經羅斯福與李維諾夫在華府十日談判之結局。乃得正式恢復。就換文八件之内容而觀。似美蘇兩國間關於曩昔公認爲復交絶大暗礁之債務·宗敎·内政·諸問題。一時俱有迎刃而解之勢。即所傳政治經濟及互不侵犯協約之訂定。亦非絶對不可能之事。李維諾夫此行之成績。可謂偉矣。其更有可注意者。則爲蘇聯於現時西比利亞極東沿海地帶局勢日趨緊張之際。竟於換文中聲明放棄對美國一九一八年出兵西比利亞軍事損害之要求。則於保証互不干涉内政雙方所負任務以外。尤有關於外交上之姿勢足滋玩味。顧蘇聯政府何以能如此放棄。而將關於阿千琪爾斯克之損害要求除外乎。則李維諾夫於本月十七日在華府新聞聯合會席上之表示。謂美國之出兵。應爲蘇聯所感謝。固已充分說明之矣。彼日本政府聞此。所生之觀感將如何哉。</p>
<p>夫美蘇今日之親交。固爲因遠東和平基礎日趨破裂而發生之事實。其成功之迅速。關係之綿密·有非羅或李二氏之力量所能左右於其間者。蓋就客觀的情勢而言。蘇聯現正從事於國内經濟之建設。惟恐物資供給之不足。而太平沿岸其他國家。則方多感市塲缺乏之恐慌。基此以測遠東大局之前途。萬一戰機爆發。殆非爲其他問題。而必由於資本主義國家擴張市塲之心理所促成。可無容疑慮。方今日本生産能力大事擴張。正向武力解决一途邁進。若滿洲之佔領。但其小試焉耳。吾人觀其自九一八事變而後。積極經營北滿東滿之交通。厲行滿鮮統制。包圍中東等。其志豈僅在逐出蘇聯勢力於滿洲而已哉。蓋彼爲完成大陸政策起見。爲爭覇於太平洋起見。滿洲一隅之地。决不足以資策動而揚威力也。然而美蘇兩國。豈有不知。乃以促成兩國復交之動機矣。</p>
<p>今美蘇之復交旣成。且其計劃之週密。有逾於一般意料之上者。彼日本之武力政策。將受何種之影響乎。謂美蘇復交之效力。將使日本之大陸政策爲之停頓歟。抑將促日軍閥悍然不顧一切。而謀武力之急進歟。就現勢而論。日本之對外方針。殆於最近之將來。必將先事内部之充實整頓。以謀更猛烈之經濟爭覇戰。故謂日本將即時挑動武力的肉搏。固未必爲事實。而謂其將使大陸政策加一束縛。亦非目前之實情。迂迴曲折以求達其侵略之目的。乃爲必然之情勢。今日之美蘇復交。不過爲遠東事態緊張之說明而已。</p>

<h3>與美日軍備競爭　不列顚積極造艦　新巡艦設計大加修改　期保持海上霸權地位</h3>

<h3>英國正式建議　法德直接交涉　法國輿論亦有此傾向</h3>
<p>（倫敦）英外相西門今日聲稱、英國業向法國建議、宜與德國直接談判軍縮問題、渠曾拒絶不待德國參加即行草成軍縮公約、然後送交德國簽字之議、因德國非一受人指導者、乃共同討論中之一份子苟非吾輩試圖洞悉德人心理、永將窒礙難行、今由外交途徑、從事雙方討論、乃有關係各國進行談判之最善方法（二十四日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）法國報界現對於德法直接交涉之是否可行、尚正在激烈辯論之中、極端派報紙新聞報稱、德國總理希特勒現已宣稱、彼本人所有與法國開始交涉之熱誠、實勝於以前之史特萊斯曼及白魯寗云云、吾人無論如何、實不能謂其非出諸誠意、故若雙方誠意祈求和平、雙方即應明白表示如何取得和平而保持之之道也、巴黎迴聲報主筆波丁那氏稱、法國駐柏林大使及德國駐巴黎大使均在繼續審查兩國直接交涉可能性之中、但法政府至今尚取保守之態度、因頗難覓得於實際上可實現之解决方案也、再則法國香水大王所辦之報紙名「人民友誼報」者稱、法國政府及法國議會旣各明瞭法國人民對於國聯之見解、正如德國總理希特勒所見者、法國之政府即不應對於與希特勒談判有所疑慮、蓋希特勒或即今日操縱歐洲和平歐洲文化之人也云云、（二十三日國民電）</p>

<h3>英政府　應付日貨競爭　令實業界自行處理</h3>
<p>（倫敦）今日午後、下議院討論對英皇訓詞答文時、各議員對於日本貿易之競爭、頗多辯論、保守黨梭浦主張在談判未有美滿結果時保護蘭開夏棉貨貿易、以制日本貿易競爭、商部大臣任錫曼答稱、關於亞洲方面、政府以爲最好由實業家自行處理、如西謨拉代表團之成功、即其證也、渠深知如政府與國會以其實業代表之工作爲滿意而政府爲其後援、則對日談判始可有完全結果、渠寗願有實業家自已談判之恊定、而不願四政府干涉而得之恊定云、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國海外各自治領地、及各殖民地境内、日本貨物銷塲駸駸日上、大有奪取英國商業地位之形勢、帝國自由貿易主義派機關報「每日快報」曾迭著長文、評論此種嚴重形勢、本日該報又載一文、謂日本實業代表團、由岡田率領前來英國、舉行商務會議、其唯一結果、不過使日貨在帝國各屬市場銷數日見增加、日本將乘機以成本低廉貨物從事傾銷、此種會議、在英國言之、究竟有何利益、該報又指斥商務部、謂昨晚下院開會時、工黨議員桑恩及保守黨議員阿斯布雷二人、曾要求政府、立即實行新關稅率、以防止日貨競爭、乃商務大臣倫西曼不惟未予容納、反勸二人忍耐、此種消極態度、實亦可異矣云云、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>外貨進口　法擬徵附加稅　中日等國一律適用　英國封法將施報復</h3>

<p>（倫敦）下議院開會、商務大臣倫西曼宣稱、法國對於英貨入境、徵收匯兌調節附加稅百分之十五、此種歧視待遇若不取消、則英國迫於不得已、在最近將來、對於若干種法國貨物亦將加徵特稅、完納此種特稅之法國貨物、其數量將與英國貨物之繳納匯兌調節稅者相等、某保守黨議員詢問政府、謂目前日圓對英匯市低落、其情形正與英鎊對法匯市相類似、英國若對法國匯兌調節附加稅、採取報復手段、則他日英國對日本貨物、不得已而徵收匯兌調節稅以防傾消之時、日本若提抗議、其將何辭以對、豈非開一危險先例乎、倫西曼未予答覆、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）聞非正式之消息、法政府或將取消進口稅百分二·百分四·百分六·同時對於某種英貨百分十五之附加稅、或亦將予以取消、應英國之要求、惟附加稅之原則、仍將繼續維持云、但法政府對於減稅似仍反對蓋每年財部對英進口貨一項即可收一萬萬法郎云、（廿三路透電</p>

<h3>登台未及匝月　法國蕯勞内閣又倒　財政案在國會中復遭失敗　總統延見各黨領袖商組閣</h3>
<p>（巴黎）政府財政治律案本日在衆議院逐條討論、結果政府提案未能取得衆院之同意、薩勞内閣乃自行辭職、按前達賴第内閣、係於上月二十三日夜間、因財政案被推翻、薩勞内閣則於二十七日組成、距今不及一月、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）右翼各黨提出財政案減俸條文之動議、贊成三二六票、反對者四二七票、此動議乃失敗、社會黨旋提出免減條文之修正動議、薩勞發言斥之、赫禮歐繼起發言贊助政府、但投票結果、贊成者四二七票、反對者三二一票、政府以此爲信任的投票、致使内閣傾覆、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>組閣磋商業於今晨開始、上午九點三十分、勒勃崙總統接見參議院議長耶納男耶氏、耶氏晋見總統後、宣稱、「余以爲此種内閣風波、必須停止、現爲關係法國運命之重大時期、較一切黨派爭執尤爲重要云又衆院財政委員會總報告員雅傑、於晋見總統後宣言謂、覓取多數以通過財政整理法案、未有如昨日之易者、就彼觀察、昨日確有多數議員贊成稅收及財政之監察行政機關之改革及俸給之暫行徵稅云、總統定於下午二時三十分、繼續進行磋商、（廿四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>失敗之前先獲小捷</h3>
<p>（巴黎）法國薩勞内閣成立未幾、今晨又以財政案在衆院先勝後敗、卒致總辭職</p>
<h3>兩小時内空氣突變</h3>
<p>薩勞内閣之倒、至爲突兀當、當午夜十二時許、國會對於政府修正預算提議、曾將其中普減文武官俸加以劇烈爭辯後、猶予三二六對二三七票之信任票、乃未逾兩小時、又以新社會黨古寗動議修正第六欵　反對免除文官歲俸不足一萬佛郎者之所得稅、竟得三二一對二四七票之不信任票、於是薩勞立偕閣員退入旁室、略行會商後、即宣布總辭職隨繕辭呈、上諸總統勒白倫總統、旋於今晨三時宣告接受内閣辭職、</p>
<h3>投票反對份子複雜</h3>
<p>據聞國會第一次之投信任票、由於共和左派領袖前財長佛蘭亭斡旋之力、佛氏曾鳩合中央與中　左派大多數議員擁護政府、而前總理赫禮歐領導之急進社會黨、亦全體擁護政府迨兩小時後之投不信任票、則因右黨中央黨與新社會黨聯合反對政府之故、所以第一次之贊成政府票與第二次之反對政府票、其數相近焉、（二十三國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）昨晚衆議院投票、推翻薩勞内閣之多數、乃由衆院内各黨各部之分子集合而成、其中包含共産黨·社會黨·新社會黨·中央派·及右派各議員、</p>
<h3>政治傾向無由窺測</h3>
<p>因此昨晚之投票、並未表明確定之政治傾向、按自本屆議會開始以來、因提出財政整理法案而引起閣潮、先後已歷三次、此資閣潮之解决、應傾向何種途徑、殊難從昨晚投票中加以窺測、故在目前對於受命組織新閣之人物、若欲加以推測、尚覺過早、此必於循例進行組閣磋商後、方能知之、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）今困難問題爲繼任人選、旭丹·赫禮歐·與達拉第皆曾任總揆者、現有繼起組閣之說、按薩勞政府成立僅彌月、因社會黨之攻擊、遂不能久安其位、據旁聽者之意見、旭丹或可組成左翼諸黨之混合政府但亦難望久存、不過可開啓赫禮歐或達拉第組織集中政府之途徑耳、此種集中政府始可有充分威權、以獲取平衡預算案所必要之票數、（二十四日路透電）</p>

<h3>本市新聞褚民誼談　中央處置閩變辦法王倫欽乘江貞艦抵滬　馮玉祥並未離開泰山</h3>
<p>中央社云、行政院秘書長褚民誼氏、前晚十一時、由京乘坐夜車來滬、昨晨七時半抵北站下車、即返亞爾培路私邸休息、中央社記者、昨晨往訪褚氏、詢以中央處置閩變辦法、當承詳爲答復如下、</p>
<h3>閩變意義尤爲嚴重</h3>
<p>據褚氏談、過去數年之中、政局發生變動、均屬黨内爭執、此次閩變則否、非特背叛總理、廢除青天白日滿地紅國旗、抑且聯絡共匪、認賊作父、凡此種種、均足證明彼等背叛本黨、摧殘國民、圖覆國家、是故此次意義之嚴重、較諸過去黨内之爭執、不可同日而語、</p>
<h3>最足痛心物質濟共</h3>
<p>贛省封鎖匪區、迄今已有多月、蓋欲斷絶共匪物質上之供給、俾得舉而肅清清之、此次閩方聯絡共匪、以物質供給匪區致使數月來封鎖之功、潰於一旦、此舉不特影響剿匪軍事、亦爲此次閩變中最足令人痛心者也、</p>
<h3>中央分别處置辦法</h3>
<p>此次閩變中主要人物、如陳銘樞·李濟深·陳友仁·等、均爲中央委員、是故中央先將三人開除黨籍、交由政府嚴行拿辦、其餘附從叛亂黨員、如不覺悟、亦决嚴厲處分、中央月前决不願以武力處置閩變、惟閩軍如有向外騷擾之行動、中央决派軍隊包圍閩省、嚴爲防衛、刻已訓令軍政當局凖備、相機處理、</p>
<h3>中央派員赴港迎胡</h3>
<p>中央以國難嚴重、復有閩變發生、爲團結一致共籌救國大計起見、定於十二月二十日、召開第四屆中央執行委員會第四次全體會議、並决派員南下、敦促胡展堂先生及西南各中委先期來京、共商國是、至於人選及人數、刻均未定、各中委主張推派吳稚暉·戴季陶·二先生赴港、惟尚待中央各常委商定後、再行徵詢同意、</p>
<h3>閩省内部發生裂痕</h3>
<p>目前西南方面、對於閩變態度、完全與中央一致、至於十九路軍之内部、亦有裂痕發現、蓋因十九路軍多數將士、固不願以過去光榮歷史、而供個人犧牲也、是故閩省不獨勢孤、加以内部發生變化、於短期間、當可消滅也、</p>
<p>華東社云、海軍馬尾要港司令李孟斌氏、因拒絶與閩方合作、致曾與閩方發生衝突、所有前泊馬尾之江貞·江元·楚觀·海寗·等艦、於長門砲台被佔時、險遭圍困、現李氏已率江元等艦到達三都、集中候命、江貞已脫險、於昨日來滬、該艦挺滬後、華東社記者、特往訪該艦副長王倫欽氏、詢以經過、據談頗詳、特誌之如下、</p>
<h3>七艦停泊馬尾候命</h3>
<p>據王氏談、江貞江元楚觀三艦、原在閩厦交界處南曰海面剿匪、江貞並載有陸戰隊一營、自痛剿海盜以來、該處洋面海盜、已次第肅清、故於日前駛回馬尾江面停泊、此外泊於馬江者、除該艦外、尚有江元、楚觀、海寗·海鷗·等砲艇、及景量慶雲爾測量艦、</p>
<h3>形勢緊張升火準備</h3>
<p>至十八日中午、福州方面中央銀行鈔票、已因該行被接收、不能兌現、同時閩方並發出佈告嘗日駐馬尾要司令李孟斌、特召集駐港各艦艦長談話、以閩省政局將發生變化、各艦方面、應從事準備、煤水方面、並充分加足、升火待命、以資應付、</p>
<h3>李氏拒絶與閩合作</h3>
<p>當夜（十八夜）本艦忽得到李司令命令、着立即開赴三都、奉命後、當即離開馬江、至次日（十九日）抵三都、當本艦離開後、有閩方所派林和淵、及容應霖（　爲雲應霖）與副官數人、至要港司令部、會晤李司令、其來意、係請李司令及在閩海軍、加入合作、當塲即由李氏拒絶、未便背叛中央、至此林容等遂怏怏離去、李司令知時機已急、而陸戰隊平日因剿匪關係、分散於各處駐防、一時集合不易、故李司令即登江元艦凖備應付</p>
<h3>一度抵抗要塞被佔</h3>
<p>至二十日、閩方乃實行派兵至要港司令部接收、當因該部僅有少數衛隊、故略予抵抗、即行退出、而此時長門砲台、因僅駐有陸戰隊一營、衆寡懸殊、故被進佔、現聞該台、閩方已置砲六門、及飛機四架、而此時因長門砲台已陷、至江元等艦險遭圍困、李氏於脫險後即率楚觀海寗等艦、赴三都集會</p>
<h3>海鷗三艦確被扣留</h3>
<p>當李司令離馬尾時、所有在馬江内港之景星·慶雲·兩測量艦·及海鷗砲艇、不及退出、致遭扣留、此外海軍學校學生·及林校長等、現仍在馬尾未退出、　營被繳械、僅損失步槍及機關槍數架、又馬江造船所等人員亦均未退出、</p>
<h3>要港司令閩已派人</h3>
<p>本艦於二十日抵三都時、陸戰隊第第二旅旅長林秉周氏、確在三都、其司令部、亦在該處外傳已受閩省委任爲陸戰隊司令、本人則不得而知、長門砲台、自被佔領後、聞已由閩當局委容應霖任要塞司令、厦門方面、現尚平靖、楚謙楚同兩艦、現泊該處、</p>
<h3>李孟斌抵三都候命</h3>
<p>本艦於二十一日奉海軍部命令開赴南京、當離開三都時、適值李司令乘江元艦、率同楚觀、海寗等艦抵該處聞此後行止、將在該處專候海軍部命令、至本艦今晨（二十四）抵淞口時、又奉到部令、着開駛來滬待命出發云、</p>
<h3>艦長登陸謁陳報告</h3>
<p>該艦於昨日上午十一時半、抵滬後、即在高昌廟浦中抛錨、該艦章艦長、即登陸、至第一艦隊司令部、晋謁陳季良司令、及次長李世甲氏、報告經過旋於下午二時許、又奉陳氏召至司令部、指示機宜、</p>
<h3>十艦集中吳淞待命</h3>
<p>華東社記者探得海軍部、確令各艦集中吳淞待命、現已抵淞者、計有海籌·應瑞·兩巡洋艦、逸仙艦今日亦可抵淞、寗海艦亦定今日離高昌廟駛往、刻在修理之海容艦、亦奉令趕修、此外昨日來滬之江貞·及咸寗·通濟·撫寗·江鯤·等艦、今明日均可赴淞集中、據聞最少須有十艘以上之軍艦、集於吳淞、隨時候命出動、</p>
<h3>陳紹寛定今晨來滬</h3>
<p>海軍部長陳紹寛氏、自閩變發生後、即留京、俾隨時與中央方面洽商應付方針、兹悉陳氏定於昨日乘夜車來滬、今晨抵埠後、即赴高昌廟、召集陳季良李世甲兩氏、會商應付辦法、並召見江貞艦、章艦長、面詢一切經過云、</p>
<h3>李薛否認馮離泰山</h3>
<p>遠東社云、日通訊社津電、昨傳出一驚人消息、謂馮玉祥於二十日突下泰山失踪、繼稱馮已化裝到太原云云、遠東社記者、特於昨晚、走訪接近馮氏之中委李烈鈞氏、叩以此說、李氏當向記者鄭重表示、謂此係日方通訊社謡傳、絶對不確、本人昨曾接得渠由泰山發來之電、該電内容、係私人間對於時局有所商榷、足證離泰山赴太原之說、全屬無稽云云、記者旋再訪中委薛篤弼氏、薛氏對前說亦同樣加以否認、</p>
<h3>高登鋌氏前午飛滬</h3>
<p>民言社云、閩省組織人民政府後、閩省府委員兼建設廳長孫希文、偕全省賑務處處、　陳培錕等、因不與十九路軍合作、乘華安輪濳逃來滬閩省委高登鋋、因乘輪不及、於二十二日乘中國航空公司滬粤線飛機離閩、於前日中午抵滬、高氏前在態式輝任淞滬警備司令時、任警備部軍法處長、最近閩省府改織、高氏之任閩省委、係由蔣委員長薦與閩主席蔣光鼐者、閩變發生高氏在閩垣黃巷住宅、曾被十九路軍搜查、兹悉高氏抵滬後、已於昨晨九時、乘快車赴京、再乘輪轉贛謁蔣報告閩變眞相云</p>

<h3>汽油漲價傳說　蘇俄油公司將與英美油公司妥恊　享用廉價汽油之主人或不無悵悵</h3>
<p>大陸報云、邇來外間盛傳蘇俄油遍地公司在遠東營業之英美油公司不久將成立恊定、倘此說果確、則上海汽車主人享用廉偵汽油之快樂時期、恐將迅即告終、現油遍地與英美油公司中人雖竭力否認業已成立恊定、或不久即可産生之說、但自日前發生煤油行將漲價之說後、果於上星期底即行實現、每十加侖由五元至五元二角之價漲爲五元七角、今又謡傳遍地·美孚·德士古·與亞細亞·四家公司至遲在十二月初將成立恊定、提高汽油價格矣、今上海汽油價以競爭而奇廉、出售公司每加侖將虧折數分、固爲未可否認之事實、此種自殺政策、不能無限期持久、亦屬顯然之情形、且自九月間美孚所代表之兩公司、將遠東營業合併經營後、已站於可與他公司競爭之地位、當時曾有或可因此安定遠東油市之說、嗣後雖未能使汽油漲價、但已免除再行競跌、故九月份每加侖七角之價、即行維持至今日、前此則蘇俄油價每遇英美汽油削價後、輙再减五分、以相競爭、所以由春間每加侖一元三角之價跌至七角、按遠東方面油公司之跌價競爭、本因俄油欲多佔中國市場而起、今美國之承認蘇俄、逆料亦可有助於兩國煤油業之釋爭和解云</p>

<h3>專件中國　近代敎育思想概觀（七）　舒新城講述孫育才律記　（五）經濟革命時期丨（國民十七年丨民國二十二年）</h3>
<p>我國改行新敎育制度、原是外患所逼成、三十年以前、執政當局因着外交上屢受創痛、急急地想自强强國、乃以「德之勢最强、而學校之制、惟德最詳、日本興最驟、而學校之數在東方之國爲最多」的理由、而極力推行新敎育、至於新敎育的優點怎樣、功效怎樣、牠所需要的社會環境歷史背景又怎樣、在當時旣無暇過問、亦無能過問、於是這「不適土宜的新敎育制度、竟在囫圇吞棗的狀態中、施行了三十多年、因爲牠太不適「土宜了、所以在三十多年中、所産生的結果、都與社會所期望的相去太遠、」敎育制度因而常有變更、敎育思想也如上書所述而有十數種的起伏、可是敎育神聖的迷夢、仍然存在一般人的心中、而治術敎育、都市敎育、人才敎育、仍然保持它傳統上的優勢、屹立不動、十七年以前、敎育失效的種種事實、固然很顯明地現於眼前、但因國人熱烈期望着國民革命的成功、以爲國家的一切、都可因其成功而從容改善、敎育也可隨政治的改革而見其功效、不料客觀的環境竟不許主觀的期望實現、五年以來、從整個的中國講來、雖然未嘗没有進步、但敎育的功效、却仍與從前無異、乃至於反有不及從前的地方、最顯明的事實、是在社會效用上、生産日趨衰落、在學校結果上、畢業生更無出路、於是敎育的功用、成爲一般人所懷疑、所討究、敎育神聖的觀念、也逐漸隨事實而减薄而打破了、同時又因着民國二十年「九一八」的國難、民國二十一年「一二八」淞滬之役、更使敎育思想、發生激劇的變化、並新的開展、現在我把它概括做四方面講、</p>

<h3>輸出變壓器之設計</h3>
<p>— 李元慶</p>
<p>不論在直流或交流電略内，外阻（ＥxternalResistance）愈大，則得到的電壓愈大：外阻愈小，則得到的電流愈大：如果欲得到最大的電力，那麽，外阻必須要等於電源的内阻（ＩnternalResistancc）纔行。這一條基本定律，大概讀過電學的人，没有不知道的。</p>
<p>第一圖爲新式交流收音機輸出路接綫的方法，輸出點ＸＸ，經過一個輸出變壓器Ｔ（Ｏutputtransformer）後，纔接到擴聲器的音圈Ｌ上。一般人以爲變壓器Ｔ的功用，祇在保護擴聲器的音圈，其實牠還有更重大的使命負擔着丨增加輸出的電力，和得到最大的不失眞音量。（ＭaximumUndistortodPower）不信，你試把變壓器Ｔ省掉，將擴聲器的音圈Ｌ直接在輸出電路内，在音量和音質方面，立刻便會發生重大的影響。</p>
<p>理由是很簡單的：普通電動擴聲器音圈的電阻，大概祗有十歐姆左右，但是普通眞空管的屏路電阻，却大至幾千歐姆，彼此相差旣大，輸出的電力，自然小得可憐。補救的方法，最好當然是設法增加擴聲器音圈的電阻，但是這在事實上是不易辦到的。那麽，在另一方面着想，便祇能利用變壓器，將眞空管屏路電阻，降至相當的數值而已。</p>
<p>我們知道變壓器内的綫圈，圈數愈多的，電壓便愈大，電阻也愈多；反之，圈數愈少的，電壓便愈小，電阻也愈少。這樣，我們祗要利用一個相當比率的變壓器，便能解决上述的困難了。</p>
<p>通常輸出變壓器比率的設計，大概是依照下述公式計算的：</p>
<p>例如第一圖，Ｖ爲丨４５强力輸出眞空管，屏路電阻約二千歐姆，Ｌ爲擴聲器的音圈，電阻約十歐姆，依上式，得：</p>
<p>變壓器比率</p>
<p>即在第一圖所示情形之下，必須用丨１４：Ｉ的輸出變壓器，纔能得到最大的輸出力。</p>
<p>在收報機内，祇求輸出力愈大愈好，音質的好壞與否，是無關緊要的。但是在收音機内，一方面固然要求能得到最大的輸出力，一方面還須顧及音質的失眞度。據實騐，負荷電阻（ＬoadReＢistance）必須二倍於眞空管的屏阻，纔能得到最大的不失眞輸出力。</p>
<p>因此，在收音機内，上述輸出變壓器的比率，便要改爲：</p>
<p>變壓器比率</p>
<p>即如欲得到最大的不失眞輸出力，必須採用２０：１的輸出變壓器纔行。</p>
<p>外阻二倍於内阻，輸出的電力，比較外阻等於内阻時約小百分之十一。通常電力减少四分之一，在音量方面，纔有一小倍爾（Ｄecibel）的損失。僅僅十分之一電力的損失，人類的耳朶是不易覺察的。</p>
<p>總之，設計輸出變壓器，初級綫圈的電阻，寗大母小。據實騐，負荷電阻即使大於屏路電阻五倍，在音量方面，比較内外阻相等時，不過祇有二個小倍爾之差。普通的人，大概須要三個小倍爾的變動，纔能辨出音量的大小。如果負荷電阻較小於屏路内阻，那麽不僅輸出的音量要减小，並且在音質方面，還要發生重大的失眞。</p>
<h3>衰老眞空管之復活</h3>
<p>— ＲＦ</p>
<p>眞空管使用不愼，絲極受到大於規定之高電壓時，往往燈絲雖未燒斷，而已失去檢波或放大之能力。或因使用過久，燈絲自然衰老，亦不起檢波或放大之作用。以上二者，均可設法使之復活，復活後仍可照常使用，其法如下：</p>
<p>（一）眞空管絲極通以較規定絲極電壓約高四分之三之電流一刹那間，（如○一Ａ規定絲極電壓爲五伏脫，則可通以八伏脫之電流。通電時間，尤短尤妙；否則反將眞空管燒毁，此點須特别注意。）然後絲極更通以依照規定電壓之電流約二三小時；即可照常使用矣。</p>
<p>（二）此法爲新發現者，效果甚佳。（作者有一一○九號眞空管，前因誤接高壓甲電，致効力大减，收音低如蚊呌，故擱置而不用者數年，前日偶檢舊物，見之，以本法治之，現已可照常應用，效力不遜新眞空管。）法以一吹炬，（ＢlowTorch）此吹炬之火熖温度，約在攝氏一千二百度左右。（如無吹炬，可以打汽油爐，化學實騐時所用之噴燈，本生燈等之火熖代之；普通酒精燈亦可勉强代用。）將損壞眞空管之玻璃泡頂部，徐徐進入此吹炬之火熖中，先微熱之，而後更加以强熱。做時不可過急，以免玻璃泡以驟熱而炸裂。俟眞空管泡上之水銀層，一部因熱而化散，即應停止加熱，而使之徐徐冷却。冷後其能力不亞於新眞空管。</p>
<p>大凡絲未斷而無效用之眞空管，十之七八，可以上述二法中之一，使之復活。以數十分鐘之力，而可使一無異廢物之眞空管，繼續使用。有壞眞空管可節省數金，亦爲國家稍杜溢漏，故特述之如上。</p>
<h3>斷絲眞空管之復活</h3>
<p>— 陳憲文</p>
<p>大家都知道眞空管是無綫電的心臟，所以要用心去愛護牠。但是偶一不小心就可以使這萬能的心臟失其作用。因此就給業餘研究者的輕濟上一個大損失。若欲救濟這種的損失，就是：一方面去防止不幸的發生，一方面是不幸事件發生後的處治。</p>
<p>欲防止不幸的發生，大概大家都已知道（如在Ｂ加保險絲等）現在不必多說了。現在要說的是在不幸發生後的處治。這種處治的方法因其損壞情形之不同而異其處治之方法。現在將處治的方法介紹給大家：</p>
<p>眞空管燈絲未燒斷者，其復活法前面已有介紹，但當眞空管燈絲燒斷時，在從前此管即變爲廢物。鄙人常想使之復活，但無相當安全方法。至今始利用電銲原理獲到成功。所用之器非常簡單，僅一普通之電鈴變壓器及一斷續器（甚似電鈴之振動裝置。Interrupter）而已。牠的綫路聯接如圖一。牠的作用是：由斷續器産生之斷續電流送入變壓器（Ｔransformer）之初級綫圈（低壓綫圈）時，其次級綫圈（高壓綫圈）即生高壓電流。再用此種高壓電流送入眞空管之燈絲，在燈絲之斷處即放電绵。當其放電之際産生强熱即將燈絲斷處銲接堅固矣。鄙人曾用此法將自已的同朋友的眞空管接好過九個。因爲這個方法尚可用於實際，所以才宣佈出來介紹給大家！</p>
<p>注意：</p>
<p>（Ａ）凡欲銲接之燈絲如已非原來之位置者，及燈絲之斷處距離太遠者均不能用上法使之復活。</p>
<p>（Ｂ）銲接燈絲電流較大之眞空管時，變壓器次級輸出之電流亦須較大，否則僅見燈絲斷處放電火花而無銲接之可能。但若銲接燈絲電流較小者（如Ｒ·Ｃ·Ａ·２０１及ＵＸ１９９等）則無須較大之電流，若太大反得不到好結果。因燈絲電流旣小則其直徑必細，而其熔化熱量因之而小也。</p>
<p>（Ｃ）輸入變壓器初級之電流用直流（Ｄ·Ｃ·）或交流（Ａ·Ｃ·）均可。但須注意者爲：用直流電時無須較大之電壓（１２伏脫Ｖolts之蓄電池已足應用）用交流電時因變壓器及斷續器之感應電阻（ＩnductiveReactance）甚大，須較高之電壓始能奏効，大約要４０伏脫才行。</p>
<p>（Ｄ）若變壓器初級輸入爲交流時，在火花間隙（斷續器者）即發現巨大火花。不但易將振動片之表面燒毁，且因其間有放電電流通過，故其斷續電流不呈激烈之變化（如零至最大，或最大至零）因之變壓器次級之輸出電壓即大爲减縮。欲免此弊，可於火花間隙處並聯一固定電容器（０·１Ｍfd或０·２Ｍfd）如圖一之虚線。</p>
<h3>固定電阻製造的經過（續）</h3>
<p>— 克銘</p>
<p>乾後的條子現在要預備經過重要的行程，就是大火爐的白熱，這些大火爐有温度的控制器，能産生華氏二千五百度以上不變的温度於爐内狹洞的周圍，其中那電阻條子正在慢慢地經過，差不多近一個鐘點這種胚胎的電阻器留在這種高熱之中，那熱的程度就是支持在大帶外面的合金也燒成白熱。</p>
<p>這陶土的外套同中心的電阻原料現在已融成一個不可入而堅硬如石的電阻器了。平常的火不能損牠毫毛，潮濕不能侵入牠緊厚的陶質，平常的過荷不使牠永久的電阻改變。</p>
<p>這長條的電阻器經一隻很快轉動的輪子割成適當的長度，於是每段都送到實騐室中去作第一次質料的試騐。</p>
<p>把許多割好後的電阻器掛在一隻鋼匣中，祗讓兩端露出。這鋼匣於是放在無尾的鏈子上移經兩隻噴嘴之前，使電阻器的頭上塗上一層純銅以使後來接銲作底。這種金屬噴射器所要的是氣炔燄（Ｏxyacetylene有攝氏二千四百度的高温）銅絲是不快不慢的送到這火燄中，銅絲在這種高熱中蒸發而噴到電阻器的頭上就立即硬下均匀地罩了一層。這樣，這電阻器始能經久不壞。</p>
<p>電阻器於是再試過而依價值分類，經過複雜的機件，捲上接綫而銲好。不用什麽有腐蝕性的銲藥再檢視了一次，於是依標凖色制塗上相當的顔色。（完）</p>
<h3>一隻優良的礦石機</h3>
<p>— 純鋼</p>
<p>因爲礦石機比較民衆化一些，所以玩礦石機的人很多，費少數金錢而能得</p>
<p>享受高尚的娱樂，是很有趣味的。而且礦石機是不費電，做好了可以一勞永逸。但他也有一些缺點，就是選擇性不佳，和聲音不響。這實是礦石機的一大難題。因爲聲音和選擇性是相對的，好了聲音，便是缺了選擇性；有了選擇性，便是聲首低微，二者不能兼有。上面的一隻礦石機圖是在幾年前外國舊雜誌中登載過的，只知其線路，其餘都記不起了。近來因一位朋友託我做一隻礦石機，我就選這張綫路，不料成績倒很可驚人，幾乎和一燈機差不多，雖然我用的天線是很好的，但是至少比普通雙回路式礦石機，要好上幾倍，所以介紹給諸位。</p>
<p>綫圈做成摇鼓式（如三回路式）外管直徑三寸，内管直徑二寸半，外管用２６誠漆包線繞５０圈，每五圈抽一個頭；假使要更加精細，則每三圈抽一個頭也可。内管用２８號漆包線繞２５圈，也像外管一樣抽頭，不過内管的抽頭不必過長，只要能夠轉成直角就是了。做好後，把外管的線圈頭串聯着内管的線圈末，這樣就變成獨個可旋轉的線圈了。内外線圈的抽頭，各自接一個分線鑰，以便分開調節。圖中用虚線畫成的Ｃ２，可加可不加，不過諸位裝時，不妨加一隻試試，加了有什麽分别？圖中Ｃ是０００５ＭfdC是０００１Ｍfd。</p>

<h3>再生圈的架子也應當通地</h3>
<p>— 朱紫源</p>
<p>一個朋友，新裝一隻一燈機，線圈用蛛網式，再生圈可以旋進旋退，裝好試聽，不料人體影響很利害，後來把活動電容器的動片通了地線，在調節波長時，人體影響果然一點没有了，但再去調節再生圈時，人體影響却依舊，當調節到眞空管將振盪而未振時，祇要手一放，不是再生力減弱，便是聽筒中狂呌，弄了半天，疑心是再生圈的銅架子作怪，於是把銅架子也通一根線到地線，人體影響果然好了，無論調節波長再生力，都非常靈便，因此知道，再生圈的銅架子也應當通地。</p>
<h3>安全的旋鑿</h3>
<p>— 慶</p>
<p>平常的旋鑿，祗有上半部是絶緣物，下半部全是導體，使用時偶一不愼，便要發生短路丨丨眞空管，線圈，變壓器等都有焚燬之虞。如果在導體上套上一段相當大小，長短的橡皮管，便可避免許多意外的損失。</p>
<h3>常識</h3>
<p>— 黃鑑村</p>
<p>（十九）眞空管概說（三）</p>
<p>（五）五極管之構造：五極管係根據四極管之缺點改造而成者，因其構造之不同，可分爲美國式與歐洲式兩大類。（d）上圖（Ａ）爲美國式之通用符號，（Ｂ）爲其電極配置之正面圖形，如市上所出售之雷電通（Ｒadiotron）牌者即屬此類。（Ｃ）圖爲歐洲式之通用符號，（Ｄ）爲其電極配置之正面圖形，如飛利浦（Ｐhilips）牌者即屬此類。其構造上所以異（c）於四極管者乃在於屏極與簾栅極間多揷入一栅狀之第三電極丨即所謂隂栅（ＣathodeGrid）者。即由燈絲Ｆ，控制栅極ＣＧ，簾栅極ＳＧ，隂栅ＥＧ，屏極Ｐ之五極而成。是（b）爲五極管構造之概要也。</p>
<p>（六）五極管之動作原理：如上所述，五極管乃根據四極管之缺點改造而成者，所謂四極管之缺點者乃二次電子之放射是也。原來在四極管中，如屏電壓較簾栅電壓爲低時（a），則由屏極放射另一種電子向簾栅極流入，此種現象謂之二次放射（ＳecondaryEmission）。是以在五極管中多揷入一隂栅以屏除二次放射之不良現象。兹略述其動作次序如下：</p>
<p>如通電於燈絲，使其熱至一定温度，則由燈絲射出電子，其放射之速度因簾栅極ＳＧ之存在而增加，遂經過控制栅極ＣＧ及隂極ＥＧ而達至屏極Ｐ。在電子未達到屏極之前，雖曾經過控制栅極及簾栅極　，但因控制栅極常供給以負電位，故在控制栅極之電路中必無電流流通，且簾栅極雖保持有正電位，但簾栅極之電路中所流通之電流仍極小量，且有隂栅帮助，屏除二次放射之故，結局流通於屏電路中之屏電流必大爲增加矣。</p>

<h3>宣傳</h3>
<p>— 庸子</p>
<p>人，眞是再也聰明不過的。明明是天字第一號膽小鬼，怯得連打後手都不敢的，却偏說是奉公廉潔，兩袖清風，明明是寡人有病，寡人好色，而不能爲柳下惠，魯男子，却會掮出周公之禮，不孝有三等一推大招牌來。明明是膂力敵不過人，見人衣袖兒一捲，早已嚇得倒蹂倒蹂，退避了三舍有半，却偏說愛好和平，不高興合人一般兒見識。明明是腰包裏不留一個，走過大舖子門口，却還要把手在腰包上拍上幾拍道，咱就不愛花大綫，買這一票東西。</p>
<p>這些裝幌兒的話，明眼人一睛便明白是扯謊，說着末本錢兒的話。說末本錢兒話的，自然不算是上流兒裏的脚色，自然是社會中的敗類。但是到這年頭兒，址謊，竟也成了一種時髦的玩意兒啦。正如性交的掉一句文，呌做周公之禮，說末本錢話，呌作宣傳。</p>
<p>說起宣傳來頭大，因爲雖然外國也有的，可是並不是我們中國古已有之，所以這倒是十足道地的來路貨。來路貨自然比國貨要吃香，所以誰會得扯謊，便會得没有相信，而至於信用掃地。若是誰會得宣傳，雖然宣傳的都是些做夢也不會做到的事情，準也會使各大報記者用頭號大鉛字編印出來，讓讀者讀着，驚奇讚嘆，拍案呌絶。</p>
<p>據人說，在這年頭兒，甚麽都少不了宣傳。小之如呌賣五香花生米，油汆豆腐乾，也得宣傳得淋漓盡致，引得不想買的人牙齒縫裏流出饞涎來，便莫想有人肯掏腰包。大之更不用說宣傳之爲用大矣哉，死的會給說成了活的。</p>

<p>現在社會上吃開口飯的彈詞家，做滑稽戲的，當電影明星的，做摟抱生涯的，他們只要用嘴用手，完全用不到那枝筆·生意好的，一個月可以賺到一二千三四千·那輩靠筆墨生涯的書畫家，一年功夫也不過賺三四千·（有幾個著名的畫家從前一年功夫可以收入四五千現在只有二千多了）至於賣文爲生的，那更苦了·一個月能夠賺到六七十塊錢，已經要嚇殺人了·要和吃開口飯的，做樓抱生涯的相比·眞差得遠了！他們做一個月，賣文的要做六七年·那怕你一日做到夜·一夜做到天亮，不吃不睡，也趕不上他們啊！</p>
<p>唉！時到今日，弄筆墨的人，已經到了末代了！說不定不久的將來，那牢什子的秃筆，要没有立錐之地呢！我想：</p>

<p>但是桂枝在城裏住着，却又想到母親一個人在家，未免寂寞，所以三天之後，怎麽樣也要回去。黃曼英將他送上電車站，也就回去了。桂枝想到上次母女進城，在黃家答應了趙家的婚事了回家去的時候，一路都想着，回到家裏，如遇到趙父子，不免有一番難爲情，應當怎麽樣去避免呢？可是人儘管爲難，心裏可是歡喜的，坐着電車，坐着汽車，人都不甚覺得，糊裏糊塗就到家了。回想當時那一番情景，實在可以玩味。現在路還是那條路，電車還是那種電車，自已經過，那就不勝其感慨了。自已垂頭喪氣的樣了，到了西直門，依然低了頭，向長途汽車站裏面走去，剛一進門，就聽到有人輕輕的呌了一聲大姑娘。猛然抬頭一看，却是甘積之直挺挺的站在門邊。桂枝陡然看到倒吃了一驚，人向後一退，紅着臉道：二爺，好久不見，你好哇！積之微笑道：咱們没有多久不見，前幾天在海甸還見着呢。桂枝想起了訂婚那一天的事，臉上更是紅了。積之道：大姑娘到了城裏來好幾天了，今天才回去。桂枝道：主人翁留着不讓走，我也就没有法子了。他口裏說完了這話，心裏可就跟了想着，我到城裏來了幾天，他怎怎會知道？因笑道：你碰見我來着嗎？積之笑道：我雖没有碰着，可是你到北京來的那天，我就得着信了。難得你還記得大紅門這個地名。桂枝到了這時，才恍然大悟了。是的，自强曾說過，把甘二爺薦到大紅門敎書去了，於是記着了這樣一個地名，那天在電車上聽到了，吃了一驚，隨便的一說，把這個消息，怎麽就傳到甘二爺耳朶裏去了。（二四九）</p>
<h3>自題照像</h3>
<p>— 傳翼之</p>
<p>朋友們歡善拍照，拍得好的，便用鏡框或銀架裝上，一再賞鑑，一再撫弄，因爲他們愛護自已纔會這樣愛護自已的照像，我呢？好像大戈壁裏一粒泣，自問過於渺小了：假如要看看自已爲生活而憔悴了的愁容，儘可借助於背後塗了水銀的鏡子，並不需要經過攝影家給我用鏡頭攝取下來印在紙上的那種麻煩的照像，幸而我已「蹺了辮子」那也不過像一粒細沙給風吹揚空中隨即沉諸大海的一般的乾脆而清凈，又何須留下照像再給世人糟蹋與賤視？至於希望留給子孫們印上瓷版，供諸香案前受世代的馨香與膜拜，那比桓司馬自爲石槨還可笑，而且，苦了自已，累了子孫，我又不是什麽「民族英雄」，「革命元勲」可以把我的照像給圖書公司印行，當作獲利的商品出賣，這於我於人全没一點意味和利益，所以，根本我就不歡喜這些勞什子，</p>
<p>前天破例的由新甫先生用自備的照相機給我單獨拍了張二寸半全身的照像，今天總算冲洗好了，拿來一看，可逼挺而蓬亂的頭髮，遮不了額上一條條溧刻的皺紋，這皺紋是勞苦的生活的記載，大概像松大横斷面上的旋紋同樣是與年俱積的吧！兩道倒八字式淺黑的眉毛，緊貼貼地覆蓋了兩個凹陷眼眶：上眼臉的下沿還各鑲了一點烏亮亮的眸子，像在凝眸沉思那茫茫宇宙中的歸宿的處向，又像在暗示他人以披荆斬棘的艱難，與已身奮鬥失敗的酸辛；兩頰瘦削的怪可憐；鼻是高高的，看來並不覺得有怎樣的討厭；口則含有怒意似的努合而不張；耳朶只隱隱約約的表現的一個半橢圓形的暗影……這不是瀟洒出塵的風流相，也不是氣概軒昻的英偉之姿，尤其不是肥頭胖耳的福壽容，是給魔鬼的獠牙咬破了膽，生活的巨石子壓碎了心一個道地的窮漢的縮影；而况背影的細方格的高篱笆、象徵着煩惱之網，愈足襯示出現實生活的輪廓，我疑心不是我自已影像，及窺鏡自視，纔信我已今不如昔，假我數年，不將儼然是一具骷髏？唉！未老先衰，是誰使然的？</p>
<p>我嘗自比爲箸，理由是從袁子才的吟箸詩而來的，他說；「笑君攫取忙，送入他人口；一世酸鹹中，君知味也否？」現在看到這張照像，始知碌碌而無所得像箸；但其質之堅强耐久，則還遠不能及，顧「影」自憐，怎不愴然涙下！</p>

<h3>談繙譯介紹</h3>
<p>— 穆木天</p>
<p>從「五四」到現在已經十五年了。從那時起，我們就一點一點地，把西洋文學介紹到中國來。這快到二十年的光隂，也不算不久了，本該對於西洋文學的介紹，有相當的可觀了。可是，事實上，到底怎樣呢？</p>
<p>巴爾札克（ＨdeBalzac）的作品，中國一本都未有。左拉（Ｚola）的長篇，中國一本都没有。「十日譚」（Ｄecameron），「唐吉訶特（Ｄonquixote）」，「及勒卜拉（ＧilBlas）」「撒提里孔」（Ｓatyricon）「悲慘世界」（ＬesMiserabes）一類的大作品，不是只有不完全的譯本，就是壓根兒連不完全的譯本都没有。除了由一些人間接地轉譯出一些俄國作品之外，其餘的國度裏的作品則是比較地更少了。從中國的譯本是不但不能看到西洋文學的全豹，而且，青年學子想從之得到比較充分的創作上的修養，都感着很大的困難。這眞是大可慨嘆的事體。</p>
<p>的確，介紹西洋文學不是一件容易的事。在文化落後的中國，想介紹西洋文學到可觀的程度，决非一朝一夕之功。但是，中國的能繙譯介紹的人，並不算少，這十數年的工夫，並不算短，而竟没有把重要作品介紹多少過來，這原故固然可以舉出很多點來，而好多的介紹者，都有三分「買辦」的態度，也是大可注意的事。回想一下，每個朋友都多多少少犯過這種毛病的。</p>
<p>我的所謂「買辦」，並不是說介紹者繙譯者之「作生意」的意思，而是說我們那些介紹者繙譯者是多多少少地在侵略主義的影響下作了他的工作。並且我們無形中受了侵略主義的影響還不自知。這不能不哀嘆「我生不辰」爲的抛棄舊的傳統，我們到歐洲去找新的糕糧。可是到了歐洲，五花十色令我們辨不出眞貨和假貨來了。侵略主義給我們看他的百華鏡。看上眼來了，眼花了，說是「美」我們也「唯美」起來了。「五四」當時我們介紹惠特曼（Ｗhitman），我們也介紹王爾德（ＯＷilde），那是不是花了眼呢？胡適介紹西洋小說時，没有令我們去領受「十日譚」，去學習李却生（ＳamuelＲicbardson），菲爾丁（Ｆielding），而使我們去知道吉百靈（Ｋipling），這又是什麽道理呢？</p>
<p>自然，這些傾向，中國的社會情形也要負起一些責任的。在中國，封建的遺留，是太濃厚了。徐志摩譯了福凱（Ｆ·barondelaMotteFougue）的「過堤孩「（Ｕndine），决非無故。巴爾扎克没有譯到中國來，而拉畢許（Ｌabiche），孟代（Ｍendes）一類的人物的作品，到譯過一些來了，也是有因，因爲中國人文化水凖太低，進步性不夠，所以侵略主義便有機可乘了。侵略主義者便在我們的不知不覺中完成了他的「導演者」之任務了。我們想辦好貨，結果，辦了劣貨來了。</p>
<p>對於西洋文字之翻譯與介紹，是中國現在所急急地需要的。可是我們要西洋文藝作品，是爲邦助我們自已的文字的發展。文藝復興時代，歐洲各國到意大利去求模範，十八世紀的英國文學，在歐洲佔了優越的地位。我們中國，現在自然要接收先進諸國的影響的。可是我們須要歷史地，客觀地，翻譯介紹有眞實性而能充分反映社會的作品，而不宜呌侵略主義的文字家作我們的「導演者」。我們要時時注意警戒着，免得使他通過我們的翻譯介紹，完全他的「文化侵略」的任務。我們要時時警戒着，免得我們的翻譯介紹成了「買辦」式的。</p>
<h3>戲子與舞女</h3>
<p>— 繩夫</p>
<p>戲子與舞女，在中國通稱「藝術家」，所不同的祇是：戲子登場必要畫上一幅臉譜，隱藏自已的眞面目，裝成各色各樣的面像，以博觀衆的喝采，舞女則不然，她不隱藏自已，有時竟至一絲不掛，裸其全體。雖然她們的腿上，也不免要塗些脂粉，但無損於肉體的本相。因此看客批評家，每每對於舞女的身體有過苛責的批評，却從不曾看出串正生的面上有滿腔可惡的麻子和烟容。</p>
<p>這是臉譜的秘密。</p>
<p>中國人一向就精於此道，這是道地的國貨。因此，許多聰明人，身然要加以愛護，留爲傳國之寶的</p>
<p>於是，臉譜在各種闊氣的場面都被人運用了，戴臉譜的自然不必都是優孟中人，也不要走進天蟾舞臺，到處你都可以欣賞到。</p>
<p>因此，面相的批評者的範圍，就不得不縮小到祇向幾個買不起面具的人或完全裸體的舞女身上來了。</p>
<p>日來報紙上載出一段「驚人的消息，」頗引起了一些人的注意，其事實大略，如下：</p>
<p>派利司舞場，有舞女尹秋蓮與高利利二人，因傷害案，涉訟於第一特區地方法院。在公庭審訊時，尹竟自承爲「滿洲國」人。這一來，弄得被告律師「駭異萬狀」，許多人都同聲斥責，一時幾乎掀起了一二八後對漢奸的情緒來。</p>
<p>這就使我想到了做舞女比做戲子難，這明明是她不能没有面具，而且赤裸着的緣故。如果她向來的職業不是跳舞，而是做戲，她一定會做出一套，「她是滿洲國人，她不是滿洲國人」的戲，畫上「不屈，」「不不屈；」「主人，」同時是「奴才」的臉譜來。</p>
<p>但是，她不會這一套。她竟被人目爲「奴才；」並且還是「天生」的，就連她的父母也頗有不名譽之感。更何况被告律師還要聲說：「滿洲國人當然不能予以法律上之保護，」還會有牽涉到傷害案不能成立，甚或還應負誣訴處分的危險呢。眞是倒霉已極。</p>
<p>然而，我却歡喜她赤裸裸的自招，一絲也不隱藏她願做日本帝國的奴民。這比起一些愛國臉譜家，在人前賭咒罰誓的喊愛，而背着人却奴顔蛇行的媚事洋主人，不較爲可愛嗎？</p>
<h3>風波</h3>
<p>— 青農</p>
<p>大雜院這一天起了一塲風波。</p>
<p>清晨，深秋可愛的陽光照到了平房，照到了矮屋，在「爵士音樂」奏過了以後不久，那些大大小小的樂器丨馬桶丨還是七零八落地放在各人的房子跟前晒太陽的時候，樓上「野薔薇」的嫂嫂穿着綠鈕扣的小馬甲蓬鬆着頭髮偎着鐵欄干俯着身子摇着頭在用牙刷兒洗口，亂白色的牙粉水滴到樓下簷前的石板上畢栗畢栗地響，垂着兩條辮子的姑娘在井邊打水先青菜，矮屋裏頭的白頭髮老太婆在門口放好了替人家洗衣服的板面丨那塊因爲洗衣衣即久了洗得白亮亮的大木板，正要提起吊桶兒走到井邊去打水，從進口轉灣那裏來了幾個穿着黑布大褂的彪形大漢，其中還有一個穿西裝的洋人。孩子們正在興高采烈地半爭吵半進行地彈玻璃球，望着這一干人衆的陌生人，誰都停止了活躍的表情，呆呆地站在那裏。</p>
<p>「外國赤佬！啥事體？」小妹妹將嘴巴　點在小順子耳恨邊輕輕　問着小順子仔細地望了陌生人一　，摇着頭表　他不曉得。</p>
<p>「行裏廂的人！」垂着兩條辮子的姑娘悄悄地　子驚訝的神情告訴了走到井邊的白髮老太婆。說着又望了「黑布大褂」一眼。</p>
<p>「黑布大褂」們很有把握似地一轟擁進了中間房子的樓下一間屋子，聽到一個什麽嬸娘的驚訝的尖呌，接着就是「黑布大褂」們的喝叱聲「不要勤！」</p>
<p>小孩子們不玩了，圍上去。小順子從「黑布大褂」的肘下鑽進屋子裏，被「黑布大褂」喝叱了一聲溜出來。小妹妹本來也想要跟着小順子鑽進去的，聽了喝叱聲不禁一怔，看了小順子溜出來在伸舌頭，她嚇着了，臉色一障青一陣白地在變化。</p>
<p>垂着兩條辮子的姑娘呆在井邊忘了洗菜的工作，可是白頭髮老太婆并没有什麽感覺似地打了水很自然地在洗衣服。樓上「野薔薇」的嫂嫂斜着眼睛着到，就那樣停止了洗口的工作，右手上的牙刷兒還塞在口裏，乳白色的牙粉水在滴着。</p>
<p>住在中間房子的人們都圍在那被搜查的屋子門口的廳上，左右兩間房子的人們也都跑撤來，站在　門外。可是，白頭髮老伯伯很悠閒地從矮屋裏拿出那架紡紗機放在自已的門口，坐下去「梵啞玲獨奏」，丨大雜院的風波與他無干。抄花會！大妹的媽是吃這一口飯的，爲什麽不抄她的家。看一看，大妹的媽連影子都没有，大妹也不知道躱在什麽角落去了。</p>
<p>「黑布大褂」們喝開了圍撤着看熱閙的人們，走出了那屋子，有一個手上捧着一隻木盤，裏頭裝滿了紙頭兒，大概那就是證據吧，什麽嬸娘臉孔失色地跟着他們走。</p>
<p>「行裏廂去！」黑布大褂對着她說，她低着頭兒不做聲。大概她在想像着入獄的凌辱與坐牢的痛苦吧，她的眼睛裏潤混着。</p>
<p>「黑布大褂」們走了，什麽嬸娘也不見了，人們這才透出了一口氣說話，大聲地。</p>
<p>「那是老底子格！告訴伊不要留不要留，伊不聽！」和什麽嬸娘同居的另一個什麽嬸娘指手劃脚地對人講。</p>
<p>有的人在嘆氣。</p>
<p>小孩子們已經在泥地上彈着玻璃球，白頭髮老伯伯的「梵啞玲獨奏」越奏越緊張，大雜院的風波也立刻平息了。</p>
<h3>兩兄弟（三十九）</h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑著　李維克譯</p>
<p>大家温從地，親暱地談着一些平常的事情。這人的氣質並没有什麽非凡的處所，但却有着許多温柔，婉緻，親切的地方。這確是他倆的一位好朋友，這是那種因爲覺得十分確實而絶不會去想的好朋友之一。</p>
<p>現在許多回憶都湧上了筆爾的腦海。瑪賴沙幾次看見他面有憂色，猜着了他學生時代的窮困，會自動地把錢借給他，也許有幾百佛郎罷，彼此都忘記了，曾没有還過。這樣看來，這人旣然躭心着他的需要，可見他是始終愛他的，始終關顧着他的。那麽……那麽爲什麽把他所有的財産都留給哲安呢？不，他是從來没有露出對小的一個比對大的一個更加慇勤，對這一個比對另一個更加關切，在外觀上對這個不及對那個温柔。那麽……那麽……然則他有一個堅强且秘密的理由，要把他的一切都給哲安丨一切丨而什麽也不給筆爾嗎？</p>
<p>他越往這事上面想，越把最近幾年的過去復活了，越覺得瑪賴沙這回對於他們兄弟倆的差異的待遇是不近人情的是難於置信的。</p>
<p>一種勵害的痛楚，一經深入在他胸裡的不能解說的苦悶，使得他的心像一把被人撥動的嵌在門上的插鎖一樣跳動着。這插鎖的彈簧似乎斷了，血從那裡滔滔的，自由的經過，把他的心騷亂地摇着。</p>
<p>於是他低聲地，好像在惡夢中說着話似的，咕嚕道：「道非知道個清楚不行。天啊，這非知道個清楚不行。」</p>
<p>他現在尋找得更遠，在他的變親還在巴黎住着的那更舊的時代裡尋找着。可是他想不起他們的臉貌這事使他的回憶變得糢糊。他盡力想要記起那時瑪賴沙的頭髮究竟是金黃的呢，栗色的呢還是黑的？他畢竟想不想來。這人最後的容顔，老年人的容顔，磨滅上其他時代的容顔。可是他想起了那時他是比較清瘦的，他的手很温桑，並且他常常常送花來，隔得很勤地送來，因爲他的父親老是說着那句話：又送了花來！可是你眞有些瘋啦，好朋友，你會要把你的錢財完全消耗在薔微花上呢。」</p>
<p>瑪賴沙回答道：「你不要管，我高興這樣呢。」</p>
<p>突然他母親的語聲，那微笑着說「謝謝，我的朋友的語聲穿過了他的腦際，這語聲是那樣分明，他彷彿聽到了似的。然則她是常常說着這兩句話的，所以竟會這樣刻在她兒子的記憶裏！</p>
<p>這麽看來，瑪賴沙是常常送花來的，他，闊人，紳士，顧客，把花送給這小店的老間娘，送給這寒村的首飾商的女人。他愛她嗎？他如果不愛這女人的話，他怎會和這商人夫婦成爲朋友呢？這是一個有敎養的，性質頗爲　雅的男子。他和筆爾不知談過多少次關於詩人與詩！他看不起那些以藝術家的面影出現的著作者，可是那些以布爾喬亞的面影出現的著作者却使他非常佩服。醫生對於他這類舉動常不免微笑，因爲在他看來這是有些儍氣的。現在他才知道這多情善感的人是從來没有能够成爲他父親的朋友的，他父親是那樣注重實際，那樣卑俗，那樣冥頑所謂詩也者，在他看來就等於一種蠢事。</p>

<p>昨華商證劵交易所、市面因本月份期貨已屆最後之一二日、多空雙方掉期至爲忙迫、市價頗爲畸形、其中以多頭掉期爲多、蓋以刻下掉期、尚屬合算、如能堅持掉期、終久必告勝利、亦觀其實力如何耳、閩事情形，并無若何變化、雖中央及粤方、軍事預備、甚形積極、但仍冀迎胡到京、事或卽可解决、以免用兵、重苦吾民、故前途尚有幾希之望、市塲形勢、完全爲籌碼關係、每屆月底、必有此軋多軋空之現象、昨日上午開盤、多頭知掉期合算、掉爲　期者頗多、市價因此回小三四角、多者如裁兵跌一元左右、其中買户以三號及五十三號爲多、次盤前别各種、買户騏　　見回高三四角、入後市上籌碼仍屬供過於求、復轉疲軟、午後一盤、多頭掉期更踴、裁兵近遠期、相差幾及一元、足見多頭　期之踴　故本月期有數種又發見新低價、其倫各種、亦因此遠期堅於近期、趨勢前途、不必過抱悲觀、愼防稍有總機、則金融界驟起維持、其實力亦未可厚非也、市價結果、計續跌六七角至一元左右、惟本月份裁兵猛跌一元八角、未免過鉅耳、成交總數、計共二千零九十四萬五千元、期貨統鹽稅共八百六十二萬五千元、裁兵佔二百八十七萬五千元、一九關善共二百零四萬五千元、廿捲廿關共三百九十八萬元、餘則數萬至一百餘萬不等、</p>

<p>棉市依然平疲繁變化但美棉續跌、市氣仍有下降之狀、惟匯兌稍縮、採換價扯平一些、市上現棉生意頗爲沉寂、各廠皆無辦胃、日商亦屬觀低、但一般棉商吸進不放、故目前仍在二角間盤旋、</p>

<h3>糧食洋麥稅有加至四角半說　標準粉邁步前進</h3>
<p>昨粉市上午開盤後、各月份市園、呈初定繼跳之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥雖續小一元一角、坎拿大跌三四角左右、且實銷胃口、亦未如前之急急、故開價時、市氣平平、惟以業外之心思、及市塲之投機多頭、以爲麥源不豐、廠家遲遲未肯暢出、其中必有重大原因、所以各盤中、依然爭先搶買、數量甚巨、致市同步步高抬、迨至下午開盤、初無特殊情形、後傳政府對於洋麥之增稅、有加至關金四角半、（合通用銀元約七八角之間）所以遠期人心大爲振動、逐步狂抬、一月份至四月份均衝出三角關口、照最近之人心觀察、恐近遠期尚有續高之機會也、至天津現貨又小、現祇二元五角、結果本月份較前日漲四分、十二月份漲四分二厘半、一月份漲四分、二月份漲六分二厘半、三月份漲五分七厘半、四月份漲五分半</p>
<h3>小麥跳起八九分</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份初見平定之象、以洋麥報價、跌三四角至一元一角左右不等、故開價時人心尚平、旋因抛户甚少、買户則仍踴躍、且粉市亦初定繼跳、所以各盤市面、亦爲震動、迨至下午開盤、交易已不甚暢、市面則步步趨好、半因底碼不豐、半因洋麥有互額加稅之說、在此國麥落令檔口、人心遂易引起也、結果十一·十二月份各較漲八分、一月份漲七分、二月份漲九分、三月份漲六分、現麥市面、交易不多、價仍平穩、中次貨亦步帶高、開崇明麥四元一角半、六合麥四元一角、漢口麥三元九角八分、計一千三百包、由信大辦去云、</p>
<h3>河下米續跌角許</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日來源四十餘號計貨（五千餘石）、包胃去路已呈轉懈、雖經天津青島烟台等帮胃納尚有三千餘包、（近四千石）、然其趨向、已見下游之勢、且其輪運亦已滿儎、次第開出、致客家都有暫行束手之象、因此市形反萎、昨市晚稻依舊垂軟角許、至常帮蘇同帮南港等粳、本街店胃猶屬平常、緣此行情亦修數分至角許、杜洋尖貨乏尚定、惟形勢已不若日前堅穩矣、隂元酒户雖運、市亦平平、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路到船四十餘號、市上銷胃仍呆、售開大盤、新粳高貨平定、中次貨早市好起數分、午市回跌角許、早薄稻羊尖亦小數分、杜埠客尖仍屬平定、白元隂元見好數分、</p>
<h3>花生到湧價跌一二角</h3>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>「吃」的研究</h3>
<p>— 立齋</p>
<p>世界各國的民族，差不多都各自有其「戞戞獨造」的特長。例如：德國人的特長是科學，醫學；猶太人的特長是居奇致富；日本人的特長是對於一切先進的物質文明加以最敏捷的摩仿：美國人的特長是「花樣翻新」……等。如果有人問：中國民族的特長是甚麽？我必正襟危坐，斷然答曰：中國人之冠絶世界的特長是「吃」！民粹主義或「中國第一」主義者們一定會認定我這種說法是「自暴自棄」，……「人必自侮而後人侮之」！然而我却有我振振有詞的答復；請看事實！</p>
<p>「吃」的分類有二：一種是直接而具體的「吃」，一種是問絶而抽象的「吃」；而咱們貴國人對於這兩種「吃」，確都是獨擅勝塲，允稱「二妙」！</p>
<p>先說具體的「吃」：中國人會由許多「嘉賓」圍坐着，生揭了猴子的天靈蓋，大家一勺一勺地攪着吃生猴腦髓；會吃「龍虎鬥」，「龍鳳大會」，會吃八十元一碗的魚翅，如果你我能夠使自已和家人的「衣食住」三項都請三項都請三四個月的「假」，到冠生園或新雅去包一桌三或五百元的全席，那些「嶺南名廚」所搬出來的希奇花樣，至少有一半是呌我們不懂得其名稱和内容的。凡此等等，無論華懋飯店的西餐是怎樣名貴，賣三十，五十元一客；然而擬之於中國人的「妙想天開」的「吃」，洋人們簡直是瞠乎後矣，不能望我們的項背。不過這些「吃」法，必須以「剥削階級」爲大前堤。在另一個「南北極」的世界裏，却也有些和我們是一樣的兩個脚動物的人，在吃窩窩頭，吃棒子麫，吃草根樹皮，吃觀音土！</p>
<p>說到抽象的「吃」，我們的「參考資料」可就用不完了！在我們「國劇」裏面，時常有「食君禄，報皇恩」一類的唱詞，又在歷史裏面，常有「食二千石」，「封萬户侯」的「大好老」們；由此可知歷代的大臣名將也者，都是以抽象而間接的「吃」爲生活方式的。</p>
<p>從前秀才們常自稱或被註曰「食廪餼」，進而中舉，會進士，點翰林，名列「三甲」，這又是中國脫離了生産關係的文人們之一貫的「吃」的方式：吃四書五經，吃八股。這是「儒」者的「吃」。</p>
<p>和尚是有名的「吃十方」，現在却有許多「佛理精深」的「高僧」們，旣有銀行支票，又有别墅外室，面團團而腹便便。這是「釋」者的「吃」：吃金剛經，吃大小菜。</p>
<p>張天師扛了令牌寶劍到大世界賣符，不惜與「人肉」等量齊觀，這是「道」家的「吃」：吃符咒。</p>
<p>「上帝」坐了帝國主義者的砲艦來「觀光上國」，於是儒釋道三界而外，又添了「吃敎」者的一羣。旣曰「吃敎」，子女玉帛皆在其中矣。</p>
<p>從前清末年到現在，許多經辦堤工賑欵的「大善士」們都弄得腰纒壘壘，旣富且貴。這事實說明了若干「善士」之羣，是「吃災」的丨丨災民的生命和血肉。</p>
<p>接濟義勇軍抗日的捐欵，據可靠的計算，總數在兩千萬元以上，但馬占山們所收到的不過二百萬，竟有十分之九被「愛國志士」們囫圇吞去。可知這些「愛國者」們的生活方式，是「吃國難」，也就是吃東北幾千萬同胞的生命和鮮血！</p>
<p>從「排滿」到「反帝革命」，一方面有許多革命志士犧牲流血，一方面有許多「領袖」們把别墅存欵，嬌妻美妾都「革」到了手。一位享受「國葬」（其實是「省葬」）的元老「大行」之後，蕪京大學的某周刊撰輓詞曰：「追隨總理數十年，下旗三日；積得家資二百萬，有妾六人！」可見那「老革命家」的胃納，是多麽强！這一批人，只好謚之曰：「吃革命」或「吃同志的备」！</p>
<p>他如好商，是以「吃仇貨」爲生命之源泉的。又如若干「編修公」，在軍閥時代，靠了寫頌揚姨太太的駢散四六，「吃」張宗昌張老帥等，張宗昌走别府，他們也追到别府，張宗昌吃了黑棗，翰林公們勢不能追隨於九京之下，但他們却又會跑到上海來替囗囗囗婦人做「什麽　序」。可知「聖門」的「吃」法，是「隨着時代的變化」來决定的。</p>
<p>經營以上各種「吃」的方式的「哲人志士」太多，結果就把中　弄成成一場糊塗。然而這現象决非永久如此的。一旦吃窩窩頸，大新澳條，草根樹皮的下等　衆團結起來，從事於歷史的總清算，則一切從事抽象　接之「吃」的方式的人們，說不定都有「吃不了兜着走」的一天呢！</p>
<h3>在播音室裏</h3>

<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>其實看看的事情都是這般容易，你一上手就覺到每一件事都有一件事的經騐。在播音室裏不見天日者幾個月，寫一點出來透透氣。</p>
<p>在播音室裏最要緊的責任，是開唱片和報告。開唱片是件最輕便的事，唱盤是電馬達的，不必你費氣力去摇動；然而對於報告却費事了，第一你的聲音出去要穩平而清晰，你要使你的喉嚨永遠保持着平度，不然，收音機上就要發生影響。做廣告，自然人家有底稿來，不過你一定要想出動聽的詞句來使每天聽的人不覺得討靨厭，如果老是本台介紹，這樣每天報告幾回，自已聽聽恐怕也要不好意思吧。</p>
<p>再說到幾隻紅電台，每天早上從九十點鐘起，直到午夜一二點鐘爲止，十幾擋節目没有空閒的時候。講到聽聽彈詞蘇灘等也實在聽厭了，想暫時脫離播音室一步，而時間老是控制着你，使你的身體像縛在機器上一般不能偷懶。</p>
<p>而且播音室裏來參觀的賓客很多（我這句話没有含些微拒絶參觀的意思）在播送節目的時候，又不能高聲招待，往往這樣得罪人家，我自已就被人家目爲驕傲的人物，大概就是我不大招待來賓的緣故。</p>
<p>還有一種在沙發椅上閉目養神的聽無線電的聽衆所永遠想不到的痛苦。現已屆深秋，在播音室中暖哄哄的確是舒適，不過在節目完了之後，回家的時候纔知道深秋的夜裏是那樣寒風澈骨的。最使人哭笑不得的是在大暑天，普通的播音室恐怕有外來的雜聲，窗户都是雖設而常關的，試想想一間小小的四週用絨布圍着的播音室，在不透空氣的大暑天，喊着唱着的人眞像坐在火爐旁邊一般。</p>
<p>在播音室裏還有許多花花絮絮趣事艶聞等，我想有閒的時候再寫下來供本刊的讀者一粲。</p>
<p>現在播音時間已到，請到下次在本刊上再會。</p>
<h3>兩位留學生</h3>
<p>— 士本</p>
<p>想不到民氣這樣窒塞，幼稚的，我們十八世紀的鄕鎭上，居然也會得産生了兩個留學生！這是何等地榮幸啊！不特他們的父母，宗族，親戚，賽過臉上飛金，有無上的風光，就是我們叨在鄕誼的一般鎭民，也覺得與有榮焉。</p>
<p>這兩位留學生的家世一位姓胡的，是宦門望族，財勢雙全，化上一萬八千去留學，原没什麽希罕；可是還有一位姓朱的，家道平平，父親是一個胼手胝足的農夫，根本没有出洋留學的資格，虧了那位胡生的父親，見他天資聰敏，大可造就，因之就資助他，同伴胡生出洋，免得自已的兒子，在國外孤單寂寞；所以這小小的鄕鎭上，得能産生了一富一貧的兩位留美學生。</p>
<p>今歲春間，這兩位留學生，已在美國ＸＸ大學畢業，而學成歸國了。</p>
<p>當他們回家的時候，像做官衣錦回鄕一樣，他們的父母，像中了航空奬劵五十萬元一樣的歡天喜地，親友們請酒接風，闊天闊地，鎭民們，給留學生三字的頭銜，聳動了，大家跑來探首探腦，一睹他兩人的風采，嘴里又不住地說着：「他們的父母，多麽榮耀啊！兒子打外國留學回來，馬上就可以做大官兒了，但是，鄰舍做官，大家喜歡啦！哈哈」因爲這半開化的鄕鎭上，從未産生過留學生，况且鄕人的腦筋里，時常印着一個外國留學回來，就和前清中了狀元一樣，馬上就可做大官兒的印像，所以現在對這兩位留學生，有這樣的崇拜，欽敬啦！可見鄕下的留學生，有多麽地榮耀咧！</p>
<p>他兩人回來了還没有一個月，鎭上的人們，已互相傳說：「朱ＸＸ已蒙蔣ＸＸ請去當ＸＸ長，胡ＸＸ國民政府有電報來，呌他去當ＸＸ部長。」這般無知的鄕民，他們的心中，個個以爲留學生，就有做ＸＸ長，ＸＸ員的資格，所以會得不期然的産生了這樣的謡傳咧！</p>
<p>但是，他們兩人，天天在忙着招尋出路，託朋友，求同學，足足忙了三個月，也没有一些希望，留學生，没事情，這般鄕下人，那里會相信啊？</p>
<p>姓胡的因爲家産富有，所以他謀事慾望，也來得比姓朱的奢大，即如有一位親戚，介紹他一個洋行跑街的位置，他竟說：「這種洋奴的位置，誰願意幹？」還有一位朋友，介紹他一個ＸＸ市政府的科員，他也說：「這種芝蔴綠荳官，誰願意擔任？」。不比那姓朱的他是出身窮苦，没有好親友，所以像姓胡的不願意幹的跑街，科員的地位，也招不到手，回國半年，仍舊賦閑家中，有一次，有一個小學敎員的機會，但是他給鎭上的人們，謡着做大官兒，恐怕失了留學生的身價，所以也謝絶了。後來因爲生活上的壓迫，出之於不得意，就偷偷地到上海，充當一個洋人手下的西崽，算是解决了他留學生的出路。這消息給姓胡的知道了，就大發雷霆，認爲這是侮辱他們留學生的人格，墮落他們留學生的身價，於是追到上海責備朱生：「你這没出息的東西，竟不顧我們留學生的人格，來幹這可恥的西崽，甘心做洋人的奴隸，你想，我比你還要高尚得多的洋行跑街的位置，也爲了是洋奴而不肯幹，還有市政府科員，我也恐怕失了留學生的身價，而堅决謝絶……現在你倒不知羞恥，來幹這種卑鄙的西崽，眞是人格掃地，名譽破産，是我們留學生中的一個敗類……」朱生聽了，氣得目定口呆，欲哭無涙，羞恨交併，聲音顫抖地說道：「我像你這樣家財富有，生活無憂，也會得顧及名譽，人格，可是……」他悲痛極了，再也没有勇氣往下說，只得嗚嗚咽咽地哭了起來，但，他的悲哀，誰來原諒他呢？</p>
<h3>「賣身投靠」</h3>
<p>— 里月</p>
<p>「賣身」，在過去封建的社會裏，有時是一件會值得引起人們一時的同情和讚揚的事情。比如賣身葬父，葬母，葬翁姑，葬丈夫之類的，據說是只有孝男烈女有犧牲自已的精神的人才幹得出的事情。這可風的事情，不但值得人們一時的同情和讚揚，並且還是流芳百世，給後人做榜樣的。這意思就是說：「賣身」不是阿獲阿狗隨便什麽人能夠幹得出的。</p>
<p>事情到了咱們現在這個動盪迷亂的社會裏，可就有些不同了：除了有决心犧牲自已的孝男烈女固然是幹得出這「賣身」的事情來以外，其他各色人等都一樣的有勇氣有决心幹這以前一般人所不能幹的事情；因爲這事情在現在與「投靠」發生了連帶的關係，所以更的好些人都已把這不花本錢的事情便當作終身唯一謀生之道的「職業」了。</p>
<p>然而這裏所說的「賣身投靠」，可以不花本錢而能得到舒適享樂的生活，與賣笑的妓女在雨雪交近的夜裏站在寒風呼吼的街頭慘呼着呌賣的勾當是有顯然的區别的。因爲當妓女雖說也是不必花本錢，但究竟還須拿以美貌和肉體任人蹂躪而後換來的錢去燙頭髮，去賣胭脂花粉，去剪摩登的衣料，去去穿肉色的絲襪和高跟的皮鞋，而且還要繳納捐稅與付二房東的房租等等：而這裏所說的「賣身投靠」，却只須把人格把靈魂一蹋刮子都扔得乾乾凈凈，一心一志像隻「哈巴狗兒」忠順馴服地跟着「主子」跑進跑出跳東跳西的呐喊呼呌以外，一切都不再須些微的繳納：不但不須美色，而且愈醜惡愈兇很愈得得着「主子」的歡心和寵愛，進昇而飛黃騰達，躍居顯要，那是滿有希望，并且是「靠」得住的。</p>
<p>然而「賣身」有「整賣」和「零售」的分</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>别，故所「靠」的亦正比例的隨着有「永久的」和「暫時的」不同。所謂「整賣」而得的永久的「靠」是從發誓跟隨「主子」以後，就永遠絶對聽候「主子」的呼喚，永遠絶對的以「主子」的意旨爲意旨，永遠絶對的不可以再去事他人，不管所「靠」的「主子」是「泰山」或是「冰山」，都得要表示忠順和馴服，這樣，「主子」就會允許它「有福同享」了，而「零售」所得的暫時的「靠」，是比較「整賣」要乾脆自由得多，然而在「出售」期内，忠順和馴股像隻「哈巴狗兒」仍無疑的是必需的條件。比如「主子」給它三十塊錢一天的「代價」，呌它去危害「主子」的異已的行動，那它的任務只是在「出售」期内必需迅速地遵命去幹成就得了，幹的手段是可以由它的，此外其他一切它什麽都可以「管他媽的」的。但有一點，不論是「整賣」或是「零售」，都共同地感覺着一種悲哀，就是除了「有福同享」或「代價」以外，假使碰得不巧而要它上法塲去「挨頭刀」的時候，那「主子」是没有出面代爲講情和求赦的義務的，而「出賣」的「哈巴狗兒」却是應該義不容辭，絶對以愉快歡忻的顔色而赴之。這就是說：扔了人格，骨氣和靈魂而去「賣身投靠」做「哈巴狗兒」的，是没有一些什麽保障的，雖然它們要可以不花本錢而能得到舒適享樂的生活。</p>
<p>睜開眼一看，大羣有爲的青年都普遍的當了忠順馴服於「主子」的「哈巴狗兒」了！我想：在咱們現在這個動盪迷亂的社會裏，難道當「哈巴狗兒」已成了唯一謀生的「出路」了麽？……</p>
<h3>「嚇死了都不怕」</h3>
<p>— 何處去</p>
<p>人呢；本來就是這麽一種乖巧的東西，他曉得說得的事通可以想，但是所想的事却有些說不得。</p>
<p>有什麽話一想起便說了。恭維點說，固然是坦白；不恭維的說，簡直是獃氣。因爲做人便總要八面玲瓏，說話便要說一輩子都不露出眞意。蓋不如此，人家便會識破這「袖裏機關」，一閙翻了人家就會藉此作爲攻擊你的把柄。</p>
<p>譬如談到想女人。人家要是問我想不想，我便一口子咬家說不想。這樣說，人家起碼就揣不定我的眞心。他即管要笑我，也就笑不起勁了。再一點，假使我果然想着一女人，人家起碼就不會怎樣對我防閑，而我呢，則可以老老實實地防備他了。事若成功，人家便祗能白着眼睛望痴的；不成呢，則我也落一個「神不知，鬼不覺」，祗要自已把喉頭那口嚵水悄悄地吞下去也就得了。</p>
<p>談到想做官，也就是一樣的。不說出實話，總是至言。人家問起了，「喂那裏空出了一隻缺，你進不進行去」？你聽，了你最好板起面孔駡他個「狗血淋頭，淋漓痛快」。因爲板起面孔，總容易使人感覺是來眞的，何况是板起面孔的駡？這樣一來，旣可以落得駡人，又可以抬高身價。更落得便宜的，是你可以使人一些不疑地去進行那事情，成則「高官我自爲之，笑駡由他笑駡」，不成呢，落得駡駡人，出出氣，並且還抓上一個高潔的名頭，也是值得的。</p>
<p>此外其他，「一通百通」，自然一樣不過呢，這其間也還有點微乎微的小問題。固然你越發認眞，就越發使人家信用。可是，若是「功行」太淺了，也難免不常常露出馬脚來。「欲蓋彌彰」，便是這種說法。所以一般「老在行」的，他們便「老練深達」，「臨敵不慌」。你越是「單刀直入」，赤裸裸地將他揭穿，我便越是「矢口堅持」，「初衷不變」。面皮紅了是不要緊的。總要態度來得堅持，抱定「嚇死了都不怕」的宗旨。那就是人家跳起來駡，哭我死了臉，厚臉皮，僞君子，我也還是鎭定的。這樣「以柔制剛」，結果人家對我還是没有辦法。</p>
<h3>歐化</h3>
<p>— 光漢</p>
<p>起碼條件是穿西裝，鞋帽當然要一律。</p>
<p>住呢？洋房最適宜；否則，應備有抽水馬桶和洋盆浴室，至少沙發就不可缺。</p>
<p>吃必大餐：不能三頓皆「大」，不得已而吃「國菜」，無妨，可用刀义代筷，也不失爲「中體西用」之旨。點心則非麫包牛油不成：喝，或咖啡或可可，聽尊便。糖切忌用散糖，概太古糖。</p>
<p>走路：聳肩，挺身，快步，如入無人之境地横衝直撞。能帶「斯得克」更好。</p>
<p>偕女人行，手挽手，摟腰亦可。</p>
<p>汽車不得常坐，則電車必搭頭等。黃包車偶一乘之，亦不失體面。</p>
<p>碰着朋友，大家應行握手禮。（點頭還可以，作揖就不成樣了！）</p>
<p>講話頂要緊，能全英或全法，又會哼幾聲洋歌，即稱上乘。次焉者，亦必揷入幾句洋語。多少雖没有凖則，大概是十與三之比最適合，。再不然，喊人呼「哈囉，」再會曰「鄂特拜，」先生稱「密斯達，」對不住呌「蘇利，」Ｙes和Ｎo，也不容你說不順口，這是最低的限度。並此而不能，則未足與言歐化矣！</p>
<p>信封宜用西式的；外國字寫不來，</p>
<p>也要把人名和地址横寫，而且次序必顚倒。姓名的書法，是名在前，姓居後。住址，如上海ＸＸ路ＸＸ里ＸＸ號，應排成ＸＸ號ＸＸ里ＸＸ路上海。更勿忘記郵票貼在右邊上角。</p>
<p>名片背後加印一二列洋字併成的尊姓大名和住所，的確也很相稱。旣歐化，又美觀。和外人交際時亦甚方便。</p>
<p>看電影和跳舞，這是「家常便飯；」「國化」的尚且嗜之，况歐化者？</p>
<p>書架上點綴幾册原版西書，又是不可或缺的，不管讀得懂不懂。出門時最好挾一紙外報，能看不能看不成問題，或者本意就不想看，只要勿嫌累煩就夠了。（至若你要知道一些時事，自然也不禁止你讀「國報」）</p>
<p>吸烟有人說是壞習慣，「洛克達」也告訴我們尼古丁含有毒質。但論語社諸君子頗鼓勵人吸烟，大約吸了總不至有多大損到人格或危及生命；故不妨試一試，因爲洋鬼子大都好之。最好吸雪茄，或含烟斗，這比較大方些。</p>
<p>能做到這等地步，已算是十足歐化，可以無憾矣！還未自足，那末，頭髮很容易，藉化學的助力，可使變色；若眼而要藍，鼻而要高，膚而要白，就中有去請敎美容院的醫生了。再没辦法，那是人力所不能，非不爲也：當是情有可原的。即道地的「外國貨，」也不至笑你「畫虎不成」吧！</p>

<h3>上海（三）</h3>
<p>— 張老三</p>
<p>（五）夢</p>
<p>昨天忙碌了一天，夜裏又没有好睡，坐上沙發，微感到睡意。朦朧中好像我和弟弟躺在爸爸媽媽墓前的草地上，一陣狂風吹過，那墳墓綻了開來，永遠嚴肅的爸爸底臉，從墳墓中現在我面前。我放了弟弟的手，想奔前去。</p>
<p>「孩子，你爲什麽離開你的弟弟」？</p>
<p>嚴肅的聲音</p>
<p>「没有」</p>
<p>「你到了上海」？</p>
<p>「是」？</p>
<p>「爲什麽」？</p>
<p>「找我需要的光明」？</p>
<p>「你已被女人圍上了」！</p>
<p>「我要報仇」！</p>
<p>「好！孩子，我隨時監視着你」！</p>
<p>嚴肅的臉變成美麗的笑容，墳墓不知什麽時候已經消滅，弟弟也不見了。一切都是黑暗，祇有那美麗的笑容，暈成剌人的光暉，牠漸漸逼近我，終於使我瞬不開眼來。</p>
<p>「爸爸這不是我需要的光明」。</p>
<p>我想向黑暗中追尋我的爸爸，被一件東西絆倒了地。</p>
<p>「弟弟，做了什麽惡夢」？</p>
<p>從黑暗中送來了這樣的細小聲音</p>
<p>（六）我是敏姊</p>
<p>睜開眼來，我倒在沙發旁邊，說話的正是我要報仇的無靈魂的女人，她老是笑着。我站起身來，很自然的扮着爸爸嚴肅的臉。</p>
<p>「爲什麽進我房裏」？</p>
<p>嚴肅的聲音。</p>
<p>「現在不是夢啊」！</p>
<p>頑皮的口吻。</p>
<p>「什麽」？</p>
<p>「不可以進來嗎」？</p>
<p>我没有爸爸的經騐，不知道現在是否可以笑的時候，竟莞然的露出一絲笑意。她是我的敵人，我不能被女人圍上，我要報仇。但是那小布爾喬亞的女人活像一個頑皮的孩子，我不怕敵人兇暴，我怕敵人橡皮性，在失却了對付敵人手腕時，耳畔響着「我隨時監視你」！隨即第二個警告「别放過她」！我陡的長了勇氣，收歛了笑容。</p>
<p>「什麽意思」？</p>
<p>嚴肅的聲音</p>
<p>「可以聽我的報告嗎」？</p>
<p>頑皮的口吻</p>
<p>「我是你母親的寄女，我是敏姊！不是你走失的敏姊。我們面貌很像，爲了這緣故，你母親走失了愛女之後，過寄了我，敏姊也是你母親賜給我的名字，她是紀念她的愛女。那時寄宿在縣高請書，我們不大有會面的機會。一年後，寄母去世，你爸爸再娶了，我就没有到過你家，因爲我們的關係，已隨着寄母的死亡而喪失。我是個寄居在叔父籬下的孤兒，寄過你母親後，她待我眞如親生的女兒一般，所以我時常到她的墳前去痛哭。在墓前，每次見你携着你弟弟的手從小橋那邊走來，我不希望我們倆個在這樣的塲合遇見：以我們的際遇，或將勾引起更大的悲痛」。</p>
<p>那小布爾喬亞的女人，不再是笑着的頑皮孩子，壯嚴得像法庭上的審判官，她接着說：</p>
<p>「每次你們從小橋那邊過來，我先從後面逃避，匿居在荒墳之間，偷窺你們的舉動，你們老是躺在草地上不則一聲，每天這樣。昨天當然也是這樣，不過，多少，我會意你的反常的舉動，在你自已，或者以爲是竭力的鎭靜。「走」，好像誰督促着我想起了這個字，夜快車正是解决我們的命運，弟弟，懂嗎？這樣來到了上海，跑進你的房間」。</p>
<p>一陣苦笑，我要報仇的敵人，已是同上征途的伴侣。</p>

At this time of serious national crisis, how important it is to unite practically and overcome difficulties together. Yet suddenly there is this act of betraying the party and the country, with such a loss of conscience and madness. It is also heard that there is an unauthorized assumption of the title of commander-in-chief of Yunnan, Guizhou, Fujian, Guangxi, and Hunan, which is extremely preposterous and intolerable under national law and party discipline. Please request the central government to denounce and punish them, to warn the ferocious and stubborn. Sincerely express my innermost feelings, and hope for your clear understanding.

<h3>Current Affairs Commentary: The Turbulent Far East Political Situation -- The Future of Japan's Policy After the US-Soviet Resumption of Diplomatic Relations</h3>
<p>Since the United States officially recognized the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the 16th of this month, thus severing the 16-year diplomatic relations between the US and the Soviet Union, the conclusion of Roosevelt and Litvinov's ten-day negotiations in Washington has led to a formal restoration. Judging from the content of the eight exchanged documents, it seems that the issues of debt, religion, and internal affairs, which were previously recognized as major obstacles to the resumption of diplomatic relations between the US and the Soviet Union, have been resolved smoothly. Even the reported conclusion of political and economic and non-aggression treaties is not absolutely impossible. Litvinov's achievements on this trip can be described as great. What is even more noteworthy is that at a time when the situation in the Siberian and Far Eastern coastal areas of the Soviet Union is becoming increasingly tense, it actually declared in the exchange of documents that it would abandon its demand for compensation for the military damage caused by the United States' dispatch of troops to Siberia in 1918. In addition to the tasks undertaken by both parties to guarantee mutual non-interference in internal affairs, there is also a noteworthy diplomatic stance. But why was the Soviet government able to give up like this, except for the demand for compensation regarding Achinsk? Litvinov's remarks at the Washington Press Association on the 17th of this month, saying that the United States' dispatch of troops should be thanked by the Soviet Union, have already fully explained this. What will be the feelings of the Japanese government upon hearing this?</p>
<p>The current close relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union is indeed a fact that has arisen because the foundation of peace in the Far East is becoming increasingly fragile. The speed of its success and the closeness of its relationship are not something that the strength of Roosevelt or Litvinov alone could have influenced. Generally speaking, the Soviet Union is currently engaged in domestic economic construction and is afraid of a shortage of material supplies, while other countries along the Pacific coast are feeling the panic of a lack of markets. Based on this to predict the future of the Far East situation, if war breaks out, it will undoubtedly be due to the capitalist countries' psychology of expanding markets. There is no room for doubt. Today, Japan's production capacity is greatly expanding and is moving towards a military solution. The occupation of Manchuria is just a small attempt. After the September 18th Incident, we can see its active management of transportation in northern and eastern Manchuria, the implementation of Manchurian-Korean control, the encirclement of the Middle East, etc. Its ambition is not only to expel the Soviet Union's power in Manchuria. In order to complete its continental policy and compete for hegemony in the Pacific, the corner of Manchuria is definitely not enough to support its plans and display its power. However, how can the United States and the Soviet Union not know this, hence the motivation to promote the resumption of diplomatic relations between the two countries.</p>
<p>Now that the resumption of diplomatic relations between the United States and the Soviet Union has been achieved, and its plan is more thorough than generally expected, what kind of impact will this have on Japan's military policy? Will the effect of the US-Soviet resumption of diplomatic relations cause Japan's continental policy to stall, or will it prompt Japanese warlords to disregard everything and seek a rapid military advance? Judging from the current situation, Japan's foreign policy will likely focus on strengthening and rectifying its internal affairs in the near future in order to seek a more intense economic struggle for hegemony. Therefore, to say that Japan will immediately provoke a military clash is not necessarily a fact, but to say that it will add a restraint to its continental policy is also not the current reality. Circumventing to achieve its aggressive goals is the inevitable situation. Today's US-Soviet resumption of diplomatic relations is nothing more than a description of the tense situation in the Far East.</p>
<h3>Situation in Guizhou Province Becoming Increasingly Urgent, Wang Jialie's Troops Retreating Repeatedly</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain military agency received a telegram from Hongjiang on the 24th, stating that since the eastern Guizhou troops launched in separate directions on October 28, Wang Jialie's troops have been retreating repeatedly. Che Mingyi's troops have completely occupied the three counties of Sizhou, Qingxi, and Yuping. Yang Qichang's troops have advanced into Shiqian and Fengquan. Lei Mingjiu's troops have recovered Sinan, Yinjiang, Yanhe, and Dejiang. According to statistics, there are as many as fourteen counties. Wang's troops are currently retreating towards Shidong and Yuqing, and Zhenyuan will be captured soon. Jiang Pixu in the northern route has received assistance from Liu Xiang of Chongqing this time and has led his troops eastward to meet with the three units of Lei, Yang, and Che. After You Guocai's troops received three regiments of soldiers from Yunnan, they have been in contact with Wang's troops on both sides of the Huajiang River since the 13th and are currently engaged in fierce battles in Baituo and Maokou. Wang Jialie is busy dispatching troops. The merchants in the provincial capital also have rumors of a city-wide strike to resist Wang's forced use of inconvertible paper money. The situation in Guizhou Province is becoming increasingly urgent, and the people's hearts are alienated. The attack on Guiyang is imminent. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Rumor that Chen Jitang Flew to Jiangxi, Engineers Building Fortifications on the East River, Air Force Transferred to the Border Frontline, Guangdong City Implements Martial Law Starting the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) It is rumored that Chen Jitang flew from Shaozhou to Jiangxi on the 23rd to meet with Chiang Kai-shek to discuss the Fujian situation, and will return to Guangdong in a day or two. Another report says that Chen Jitang was still in the province on the 24th, convening a military conference of the group army. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Huang Renhuan's division withdrew from the Fujian border back to Dabu and Jiaoling in Guangdong starting on the 20th. A large engineer team departed from the province on the 24th to build fortifications on the East River. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chen Jitang and the generals discussed and decided on military measures to cope with the situation, in case of emergency. First, he ordered the southern Jiangxi troops to shorten the defense line, and the eastern Jiangxi troops to return to the East River. The First Independent Division, Huang Renhuan's troops, withdrew from western Jiangxi and returned to Jiaoling, Dabu, and other counties on the Guangdong border. The Second Independent Brigade, Chen Zhang's troops, returned to defend the East River. He telegraphed the troops stationed in the northeast Jiangxi to defend strictly and await orders. He ordered Huang Guangrui, commander of the Air Force, to quickly send air squadrons to be stationed in the northeastern counties on the provincial border to strengthen air defense. The Navy and the ships of the Fourth Group Army strengthened coastal and river defenses. If necessary, troops will be transferred to reinforce the Fujian border, and Li Zongren was requested to send troops to southern Jiangxi to strengthen defenses. Chen Jitang has ordered the army, navy, and police stationed in the provincial capital to be on strict alert to prevent villains from taking the opportunity to steal. At the same time, he issued orders to his subordinates to strictly protect the lives and property of foreigners. Therefore, Guangzhou City has implemented martial law since the 23rd, and the Navy has also issued martial law, prohibiting officers and soldiers from taking leave, and the ships are firing day and night in preparation for deployment. (24th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) The Guangzhou Air Force is currently preparing everything. Two detachments have been ordered to fly to the front lines of the North River and East River, and several other teams have received preparation orders and are engaged in training all day. The First Army Group has approximately one hundred fighters and bombers, of which several are the latest models. (24th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Fujian Independence Has Communist Tendencies</h3>
<p>(Guangzhou) The independence of Fujian Province is said to have communist tendencies, which has caused great anxiety among officials and civilians here. Leaders of the business and banking communities have expressed their views, believing that the rebellion of the 19th Route Army will fail if its purpose is to establish a communist government because Chinese businessmen and bankers will definitely not support it. Guangzhou people have not forgotten the terrifying era of the Red Army's ravages in 1928. Xu Qian is known for his radicalism and is now one of the active figures in the Fujian Rebellion. This is also very disturbing. According to reliable Chinese sources in Xiamen, the 19th Route Army has recruited some Red Army soldiers in recent weeks. There are still Red Army soldiers gathered in Dehua and other places, waiting to be incorporated into the 19th Route Army, so the number of troops in the 19th Route Army has greatly increased and will be organized into two new armies.

<h3>Southern Route Generals Will Issue Circular Telegram</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Guangzhou telegram: After the Fujian situation changed, Chen Jitang, commander of the Southern Route Bandit Suppression, has sent several telegrams to the central government reporting on the military and political situation in the southwestern provinces in great detail.

The entire Southern Route Bandit Suppression Headquarters will soon issue a circular telegram, listing the crimes of the Fujian People's Government. The circular telegram will be led by Chen Jitang, with army commanders Yu Hanmou, Li Yangjing, and independent division commanders Miao Peinan, Li Hanhun, Deng Longguang, Huang Renhuan, and brigade commanders Chen Hanguang, Zhang Ruigui, and others listed.

<h3>Guangdong Province Troops Mobilizing Urgently</h3>
<p>(Guangzhou) Due to the developments in Fujian, the troops of Guangdong Province have been urgently mobilized to prepare for any eventuality. Currently, all stationed troops have been transferred to appropriate locations to strengthen defenses. The Guangdong troops have experienced many battles, and their firearms are also extremely sophisticated. The future battlefield is likely to be in the area bordering Guangdong and Fujian. The Guangdong Air Force has over a hundred aircraft, including fighter and bomber planes. Although the 19th Route Army has aircraft donated by overseas Chinese, their strength is less than one-third of that of Guangdong Province. The Dongjiang area is the most critical location, and many Guangdong troops are heading there from northern Guangdong to concentrate in that area. Huizhou is the most strategically important location for the Dongjiang defense and is currently defended by the Independent 4th Division, which is arranging defenses. Other troops are concentrated in Meixian and Zhao'an areas. Currently, the Dongjiang troops number around twenty regiments. Chen Guanghan and Li Hanhun's armies have been ordered to prepare for immediate deployment, and a portion may be dispatched to Dongjiang when necessary. At the same time, Chen Guanghan's army may be transferred from Hainan back to the provincial capital for defense. The Air Force has already dispatched the 3rd and 5th Squadrons to Dongjiang, and additional flight squadrons will be sent to Meixian and Zhao'an. If war breaks out, the Air Force will be very active. The Guangdong Navy has also been ordered to protect various seaports, but the Hai Xin warship will remain in Huangpu. Military preparations in Guangzhou City are being increased, and anti-aircraft guns have been positioned at key locations. Although martial law has not been declared, military police are strictly searching pedestrians and vehicles. According to news from Xiamen, the military situation in Fujian Province was described as follows: the 49th, 60th, 61st, and 78th Divisions of the 19th Route Army are currently stationed in Longyan, Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, and Fuzhou, respectively. Part of the 60th Division and the 335th Regiment are currently stationed in Xiamen. The headquarters of the 19th Route Army has been moved from Zhangzhou to Fuzhou.

News of this has spread, causing great alarm. At this time of foreign invasion, when the nation's fate hangs by a thread, we fear danger even if we resist to the end. If we take a divergent path, the consequences will be dire. We, your humble colleagues, are deeply concerned about the difficulties of the time and cannot remain silent. We hope that all virtuous individuals inside and outside the government will consider the nation's peril and strive to salvage the situation. This is our urgent plea, and we earnestly await your response." The Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Committee bows in respect. (Central News Agency telegram from the 20th)</p>
<h3>Zou Lu and Xiao Focheng's Statements</h3>

<p>(Guangzhou) Xiao Focheng issued a statement today, expressing regret over Fujian Province's secession from the Kuomintang. He claimed that the Kuomintang is not a political party of a few people but is composed of loyal comrades who follow Sun Yat-sen's principles. The 19th Route Army has always enjoyed a good reputation in the country, but it is a pity that it has taken this worthless anti-Kuomintang action. This action will not only fail to benefit the people but will also subject Fujian Province to further devastation, especially in the labor and peasant sectors. (Reuter's telegram from the 24th)</p>

<h3>In Military Competition with the U.S. and Japan, Britain Actively Builds Warships; Design of New Cruiser Greatly Revised; Aims to Maintain Maritime Hegemony</h3>
<p>(London) Britain is currently making every effort to accelerate its warship construction program in order to maintain its traditional maritime hegemony. According to reliable sources, the British government, in view of the urgent warship construction of the United States and Japan, intends to start construction on the original warship construction plan several months ahead of schedule. When asked about this, a spokesperson for the Navy Department neither denied nor confirmed it. According to the warship construction program passed by the British Parliament this year, there are four light cruisers, nine destroyers, and three submarines. Under normal circumstances, construction of these new warships would not begin until February or March of next year. It is now heard that preparations are being made to start construction ahead of schedule and accelerate construction, and the design of the light cruisers will be greatly revised in order to increase the number of gun emplacements. This is because of the progress of the new American 10,000-ton cruisers with six-inch guns and the Japanese new 8,500-ton cruisers capable of installing fifteen five-inch guns, whose designs are superior to the original British designs. Therefore, it is necessary to revise them. Currently, the Navy Department is generally silent on these reports, but it is expected that the British government will use all its efforts to complete these new warships as soon as possible, because not only is the warship construction competition between the United States and Japan frightening, but Japan's stated intention to demand equality with Britain and the United States at the next naval conference is also considered a threat to Britain's position at sea.

<h3>Glimmer of Hope for Disarmament; Mussolini Drafts New Plan; Expected to be Accepted by Britain, the United States, France, and Germany; Major Powers to Meet in Rome Before Christmas</h3>

According to official sources, this plan was drafted by Mussolini and is expected to be accepted by Germany and the other four countries. The location of the four-power conference is expected to be in Italy, or even in Rome. (National News Agency telegram from the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Britain Formally Suggests Direct Negotiations Between France and Germany; French Public Opinion Also Inclined to This</h3>
<p>(London) British Foreign Secretary Simon stated today that Britain has suggested to France that it should directly negotiate the disarmament issue with Germany. He rejected the proposal to draft a disarmament treaty without Germany's participation and then send it to Germany for signature, because Germany is not someone to be instructed, but a party to the joint discussion. If we do not try to understand the German psyche, we will never be able to move forward. Now, engaging in bilateral discussions through diplomatic channels is the best way for the countries concerned to conduct negotiations. (National News Agency telegram from the 24th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French press is currently engaged in intense debate over the feasibility of direct negotiations between Germany and France. The extreme newspaper, "News," claimed that German Chancellor Hitler has now declared that his own enthusiasm for starting negotiations with France is greater than that of Stresemann and Briand in the past. No matter what, we cannot say that this is not sincere. Therefore, if both sides sincerely seek peace, both sides should clearly express how to achieve and maintain it. Mr. Bodina, the editor of "Echo de Paris," stated that the French ambassador to Berlin and the German ambassador to Paris are continuing to review the possibility of direct negotiations between the two countries, but the French government is still taking a conservative attitude because it is difficult to find a practical solution that can be realized. Furthermore, the newspaper "Friendship of the People," which is run by the French perfume king, stated that since the French government and the French parliament each understand the views of the French people on the League of Nations, as German Chancellor Hitler sees them, the French government should not have any doubts about negotiating with Hitler, because Hitler may be the person who manipulates European peace and European culture today. (National News Agency telegram from the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding the recent interview with French journalist Balinon of "Political News" by German Chancellor Hitler, the German National Socialist Party organ "Angriff" published an article today entitled "Hitler Repeatedly Extends a Hand to France," stating that while Hitler declared that for the sake of European peace, he was willing to listen to everything, consider everything, and bear everything, he had not forgotten to reiterate the issue of Germany's own security and refute the French theory of building its security on Germany's weakness. Moreover, there are still French newspapers that insist on a frenzied and restrictive attitude, such as "Le Petit Parisien." Therefore, Hitler should further clarify and refute the rumor that he is inclined to war, because Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations is not enough to constitute a threat of war, and this move is actually the first step in a cleansing movement in direct negotiations between Germany and France in order to clear away the various misunderstandings in the international parliament in Geneva and all other parliaments, and these misunderstandings are actually enough to promote hatred among the major powers. Hitler declared, "I am a person who takes action, but I am fully responsible for my actions. I lead the people, I gain strength from the people themselves, but I also do not use my own life as collateral." The world should know that the German people today are entirely united behind Hitler.

<h3>British Government Responds to Japanese Goods Competition; Orders Business Community to Handle It Themselves</h3>
<p>(London) This afternoon, during the discussion of the response to the British Imperial Mandate in the House of Commons, the members debated a lot about the competition from Japanese trade. Conservative MP Thorpe advocated protecting the Lancashire cotton trade to counter Japanese trade competition until negotiations had satisfactory results. Secretary of Commerce Runciman replied that, with regard to Asia, the government believes that it is best for industrialists to handle it themselves. The success of the Seymour delegation is proof of this. He knows very well that if the government and Congress are satisfied with the work of its industrial representatives and the government supports them, then negotiations with Japan can have complete results. He would rather have an agreement negotiated by industrialists themselves than an agreement obtained by the intervention of four governments. (Reuter's telegram from the 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) The market for Japanese goods is growing rapidly within the overseas autonomous territories and colonies of the British Empire, and there is a tendency to seize Britain's commercial position. The "Daily Express," the organ of the Imperial Free Trade faction, has repeatedly published lengthy articles commenting on this serious situation. Today, the newspaper published another article, saying that the Japanese industrial delegation, led by Okada, came to Britain to hold business meetings, and the only result was that the sales of Japanese goods in the imperial markets increased day by day. Japan will take the opportunity to dump goods at low cost. What are the benefits of this meeting for Britain? The newspaper also accused the Department of Commerce, saying that when the House of Commons met last night, Labour MP Thorne and Conservative MP Astorley asked the government to immediately implement new tariff rates to prevent Japanese goods from competing. However, Secretary of Commerce Runciman not only did not accommodate this but also advised the two to be patient. This passive attitude is really strange. (Havas telegram from the 24th)</p>
<h3>Foreign Currency Imports: France Plans to Levy Additional Taxes; China, Japan, and Other Countries Uniformly Applicable; Britain Threatens Retaliation</h3>
<p>(Paris) The French government previously ordered that goods imported from countries with depreciated currencies should be subject to an exchange adjustment surtax, uniformly applicable to Ceylon, China, the Malay Archipelago, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand, the Soviet Union, South Africa, and other countries. A bill was submitted to the Chamber of Deputies requesting approval of this order. The Chamber designated Member of Parliament Berard to study the case and submit a report. Berard concluded that the tax rate set by the government was not excessively high, demonstrating prudence and wisdom. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) In a session of the House of Commons, the President of the Board of Trade, Walter Runciman, declared that France was levying an exchange adjustment surtax of 15% on British goods entering the country. If this discriminatory treatment is not rescinded, Britain will be forced, in the near future, to impose special taxes on certain French goods, with the quantity of French goods subject to these special taxes being equivalent to the quantity of British goods subject to the exchange adjustment tax. A Conservative MP questioned the government, stating that the current exchange rate of the Japanese yen against the British pound is low, similar to the situation of the British pound against the French franc. If Britain adopts retaliatory measures against the French exchange adjustment surtax, and then in the future Britain is forced to levy an exchange adjustment tax on Japanese goods to prevent dumping, what response could Britain give if Japan were to protest? Would this not set a dangerous precedent? Runciman did not respond. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) Unofficial sources say that the French government may cancel the import taxes of 2%, 4%, and 6%, and may also cancel the 15% surtax on certain British goods in response to British requests. However, the principle of the surtax will be maintained. But the French government seems to still oppose tax reductions, as the Ministry of Finance can collect 100 million francs annually from British imports alone. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Does Not Wish To Change Monetary Policy; New Treasury Secretary Summoned to Warm Springs for Thorough Discussion of Financial Issues</h3>
<p>Sources close to the US President in Warm Springs today claimed that the government does not intend to change its monetary policy. Acting Treasury Secretary Morgenthau will arrive here tomorrow to consult with the President, which is merely routine government business. It is expected that Morgenthau may stay here temporarily to rest over the Thanksgiving holiday. However, well-informed sources claim that the President will thoroughly discuss the government's financial position with Morgenthau, especially focusing on the results of gold purchases. (National News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) The advisory committee of the US Federal Reserve Bank today passed a resolution declaring its full support for the aims and objectives of the US President's recovery plan, but strongly opposed its monetary methods, arguing that artificially suppressed currency cannot achieve President Roosevelt's desired goals. Therefore, it suggested restoring the gold standard, as only by increasing industry and commerce to increase natural benefits can the benefit of raising prices be enjoyed.

<h3>Japan Implements New Monetary Policy</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Japan has announced a new monetary policy. From today, the Bank of Japan will buy new mined gold at a price of 2.6 yen per gram, which is about 0.28 yen higher than before. The Bank of Japan will abandon the policy of setting the gold price based on the US dollar exchange rate. Hereafter, the price will be based on the London gold market price, as the future trend of the US dollar is difficult to predict. The new price will be set once every half month or more, based on the average exchange rate against the British pound. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>After Major Budget Cuts in Japan, Revival Requests Rejected; Takahashi's Attitude Quite Firm</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Negotiations between the Ministry of Finance and various ministries regarding requests for budget revivals for the coming year have now reached their peak. The Budget Bureau of the Ministry of Finance yesterday invited accounting officials from various ministries to present their views on the Ministry of Finance's opinions on the revival requests, and rejected them all. The most problematic are the budgets for the Army and Navy. The Navy's revival request of 130 million yen, centered on the issues of construction costs and reduced unit prices for aircraft, and the Army's request of 110 million yen, were not approved by the Ministry of Finance authorities, which requested the Army and Navy to reconsider. If the Army and Navy were treated this way, the other ministries were even less likely to succeed. Subsequently, all ministries requested the Ministry of Finance to reconsider, with reservations. Furthermore, Fujii, the Director of the Budget Bureau, visited the Minister of Finance yesterday to report on the progress of negotiations with various ministries. The Minister of Finance's attitude this year is different from last year, being quite firm, stating that even if revival requests were approved, the limit would be 20 million yen. However, the ministries are determined to pursue their requests. On the 25th, the ministers will begin political negotiations with the Minister of Finance. Apart from a general approval of several tens of millions of yen for revival, there is likely no other solution. (Dentsu dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yesterday, Home Minister Yamamoto visited Minister of Finance Takahashi at his official residence to discuss the internal affairs budget. At that time, the Home Minister expressed hope regarding the budgetary aid, but Minister Takahashi expressed his determination, saying that the next year's budget takes into account internal and external circumstances, and he is confident in what he has determined. The ministries may have dissatisfaction with it, so he intends to resolutely reject revival requests. If they insist, he will have to fight for his position, indicating a firm will and a willingness to gamble his position. (Dentsu dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Perpetrators of Attack on Wakatsuki Confess to Assassination Plot; Noguchi and Matsui's Joint Attack Fails</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Two members of the Japan Boxing Association, Noguchi Susumu and Matsui Haruo, who attacked Wakatsuki Reijiro, the president of the Minseito party, are being interrogated at the Metropolitan Police Department under the supervision of Police Inspector Shimizu. The discrepancies in the two men's statements are being rigorously investigated. Until the morning of the 24th, Noguchi still denied initially harboring any intention to kill, but due to the authorities' sharp investigation, he reversed his denial of intent to kill and confessed that he initially collaborated with Matsui on an assassination plot. According to his confession, when Wakatsuki got off at Ueno Station and was heading to the car location to change vehicles, Noguchi went to the president's right and Matsui went to his left, launching a joint attack and attempting to resolve the matter in one stroke. Such was their plan. Noguchi set off before Matsui and rushed to attack, thinking it was an instruction from the leader. Matsui continued to observe the situation and rushed forward. At this time, Noguchi had already been spotted by members of outside groups and plainclothes police officers and was apprehended on the spot. Personnel protecting Wakatsuki had already arrived at the ticket gate, so Matsui lost his opportunity to assassinate and took a ride to his home in Hongo Yamato Village. Thus, the two men's confessions gradually converged, and it is heard that the authorities will also thoroughly investigate the backgrounds and relationships of the perpetrators.

The Argentine press is also calling for recognition of the Soviet Union and urging the government to abandon "narrow-minded prejudices." (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>US Ambassador to Cuba Replaced; Cuban Government's Position Not Solid; Too Early for US Recognition</h3>
<p>(Warm Springs) US President today announced the exchange of Assistant Secretary of State Caffery with US Ambassador to Cuba Welles, and solemnly declared that this change of ambassadors is not a precursor to the US recognition of the Cuban San Martin government. The US is delaying recognition entirely because the extent to which the San Martin government is supported by the people has not been determined. If it is a government that the Cuban people trust, the US will welcome it. (National News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>British Conservative MP Emphasizes Importance of Shanghai; Writes to The Times</h3>
<p>(London) In a letter published in today's edition of The Times, Conservative MP Sandeman wrote that Shanghai is of equal importance to China and foreign countries, as it is the center of Chinese commerce and finance, and also a storehouse of China's great interests. Therefore, the relationship between China and the Great Powers regarding the future organization of Shanghai is extremely important. The Shanghai Municipal Council previously requested Feetham to present proposals for Shanghai's future, but his report has never received attention from officialdom. It must be known that the security of Shanghai has a great impact on the East and the West, and true statesmen must seek to solve this difficult problem. Feetham's report is the best basis for discussing this matter. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Discriminatory Treatment of Students Studying in Japan; Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Plans to Improve Conditions in Provinces for Pacification Purposes</h3>
<p>The Tokyo Hochi Shimbun reported on the 17th that since the Manchurian Incident, Chinese students studying in Japan have been particularly vocal in their anti-Japanese sentiments. After Mr. Gan Jielan, the military attaché of the Chinese Embassy in Japan, stated that "ill-treatment by Japanese dormitories and innkeepers has aroused ill feelings among students studying in Japan," the Cultural Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is striving to improve treatment in order to pacify the students. In the future, they will all be important figures when they return to their home countries. If there is no good intention in advance, they will inevitably shout anti-Japanese slogans upon returning home, which will have a major impact on Sino-Japanese friendship.</p>

<h3>Japanese Night Flight Accident</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of Communications began operating nighttime air mail service on November 1st, and the results have been very good for half a month. However, due to inadequate nighttime equipment, at 7:20 last night, its aircraft collided with a tall building and crashed, destroying the fuselage and injuring the pilot. Nighttime aviation training is of great importance for air defense during wartime. The Japanese Ministry of Military and Ministry of Communications have decided to strictly investigate the cause of the accident to provide a reference for nighttime aviation equipment.

<h3>President Murayama of Asahi Shimbun Passes Away</h3>
<p>(Osaka) Murayama Ryuhei, the president of the Osaka Asahi Shimbun and Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, and a member of the House of Peers, previously suffered from a cold and was recuperating. Recently, pneumonia developed as a complication, and his condition deteriorated, passing away at his home in the countryside this morning at 3:00 AM, at the age of 84. Mr. Murayama was a famous scholar of national learning, born in Mie Prefecture, the eldest son of Murayama Morio. In the fourth year of Meiji (1871), he went to Osaka to run a Western goods store. From the fourteenth year of Meiji (1881), he accepted the publication of a tri-weekly newspaper by Kimura Heihachi. Thereafter, he engaged in the newspaper business, which was the predecessor of the Osaka Asahi Shimbun. In recent years, he fought fiercely and consolidated the foundation of the newspaper. In the twenty-second year of Meiji (1889), he bought the Tokyo Mezamashi Shimbun, renamed it the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, and worked hard to struggle. The east and west echoed each other, leading to today's greatness. In the fourth year of Taisho (1915), he was awarded the Third Class Order of Merit for his achievements and awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure. He was elected twice as a member of the House of Representatives and is currently a member of the House of Peers. His wife, Masuko, had no children and adopted Murayama Nagake, a director of the company, as her adopted son. (Dentsu dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>The Sarraut Cabinet in France Falls Before Completing a Month in Office; Finance Bill Fails Again in Parliament; President Extends Interviews to Party Leaders to Discuss Cabinet Formation</h3>
<p>(Paris) The government's financial austerity bill was discussed clause by clause in the Chamber of Deputies today. As a result, the government's proposal failed to obtain the Chamber's agreement, and the Sarraut Cabinet resigned. The previous Daladier Cabinet was overthrown on the night of the 23rd of last month due to the rejection of the financial bill. The Sarraut Cabinet was formed on the 27th, less than a month ago. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) A motion by the right-wing parties to reduce salaries in the finance bill was approved by 326 votes, with 427 against. This motion failed. The Socialist Party then proposed an amendment to exempt salaries. Sarraut spoke out against it, and Herriot followed up with a speech supporting the government. However, the vote resulted in 427 votes in favor and 321 votes against. The government took this as a vote of confidence, leading to the cabinet's collapse. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Cabinet formation consultations began this morning. At 9:30 AM, President Lebrun met with Senate President Jeanneney. After meeting with the President, Jeanneney declared, "I believe that this kind of cabinet turmoil must stop. This is a critical time concerning the fate of France, which is more important than all partisan disputes." Furthermore, Jacques, the general rapporteur of the Chamber of Deputies' Finance Committee, declared after meeting with the President that it has never been easier than yesterday to find a majority to pass the financial adjustment bill. According to his observations, yesterday there were indeed a majority of members who supported tax revenue and the reform of the financial oversight administrative organs, as well as the temporary taxation of salaries. The President is scheduled to continue consultations at 2:30 PM. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>A Small Victory Before the Failure</h3>
<p>(Paris) The French Sarraut Cabinet was only recently established, but this morning it won a small victory on the finance bill in the Chamber of Deputies before suffering defeat, ultimately leading to its resignation.</p>
<h3>Sudden Change in Atmosphere Within Two Hours</h3>
<p>The fall of the Sarraut Cabinet was extremely abrupt. At around midnight, the parliament had given a vote of confidence of 326 to 237 on the government's proposed amendment to the budget, after a heated debate on the general reduction of salaries for civil and military officials. However, in less than two hours, a new motion from the Socialist Party, led by Gounin, to amend Clause 6 – opposing the exemption from income tax for civil servants whose annual salaries are less than 10,000 francs – gained a vote of no confidence with 321 votes against 247. Sarraut immediately retreated into a side room with his cabinet members. After a brief consultation, they announced their resignation and submitted their resignations to President Lebrun, who announced the acceptance of the cabinet's resignation at 3 AM this morning.</p>
<h3>Complex Elements Voting in Opposition</h3>
<p>It is reported that the initial vote of confidence was due to the efforts of former Finance Minister Flandin, the leader of the Republican Left. Flandin had rallied most of the centrist and center-left members to support the government, and the Radical Socialist Party, led by former Prime Minister Herriot, also fully supported the government. The vote of no confidence two hours later was due to the united opposition of the right-wing Central Party and the new Socialist Party. Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the government the first time and the number of votes against the government the second time were similar. (National News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) Last night's vote in the Chamber of Deputies, which overthrew the Sarraut Cabinet, was made up of members from various parties and factions within the Chamber, including members from the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, the New Socialist Party, the Central Party, and the right-wing parties.</p>
<h3>No Way to See Political Tendencies</h3>
<p>Therefore, last night's vote did not indicate a definite political tendency. Since the beginning of this parliament, the introduction of the financial adjustment bill has caused three waves of cabinet changes. It is difficult to discern from last night's vote which path the solution to this cabinet change should lean towards. Therefore, it is too early to speculate on the person who will be commissioned to form a new cabinet. This will only be known after the customary cabinet formation consultations have taken place. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Doumergue to Form a Cabinet of National Unity?</h3>
<p>(Paris) According to well-informed sources, the successor is likely to be Doumergue, who will contact the Central Party to organize a cabinet of national unity. It is feared that cabinet members will be largely changed, except that Poincaré will likely continue as Minister of Finance and Daladier will likely continue as Minister of the Army. (National News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) The current difficult problem is the choice of a successor. Doumergue, Herriot, and Daladier have all served as Prime Ministers. There is currently talk of them succeeding in forming a cabinet. The Sarraut government was only established for a month, and was unable to maintain its position for long due to the attacks of the Socialist Party. According to the views of observers, Doumergue may be able to form a mixed government of left-wing parties, but it is unlikely to last long. However, it may open the way for Herriot or Daladier to organize a centralized government. Only this kind of centralized government can have sufficient authority to obtain the necessary votes for a balanced budget bill. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Germany Promulgates New Press Law; Violators Face Death or Imprisonment</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The new law terminating freedom of speech for newspapers was published today. It stipulates that journalists who violate the law will face punishments such as being blacklisted, fined, or imprisoned, depending on the nature of the crime. Part of the press law was previously implemented by cabinet order, stipulating that words that instill treason must be punished with the death penalty or 15 years of imprisonment. According to the new law, journalists must not publish in newspapers (1) words that mix personal interests with public interests to confuse the public; (2) news that undermines the power of the German government at home and abroad; (3) words that weaken the unified will of the German people; (4) words that weaken national preparedness; (5) words that are sufficient to damage German cultural and economic life and religious sentiments, and words that damage the reputation and dignity of others with slanderous and mocking tones.

<h3>Chiang Kai-shek's Special Commissioner Stationed in Sichuan to Supervise the Suppression of Bandits; Xu's Bandits Flee to the Border of Shaanxi, Yang's Troops Ordered to Intercept; He's Bandits in Eastern Sichuan in Contact with Liu Xiang's Troops</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Xu Xiangqian's bandit troops have recently been rampaging in Sichuan Province, advancing on three fronts. One group is in contact with Tian Songyao's army along the Zhaoguang-Cangbao line, attempting to cross the Jialing River to occupy the strategic Jianmen Pass. Another group is confronting Liu Xiang's army along the Sui-Xuan-Kaijiang line, waiting for an opportunity to advance eastward to meet He Long. A third group is heading north out of Chengkou to spy on southern Shaanxi, seeking to open the road between Sichuan and Shaanxi. Apart from the Jialing River battle, the truth of which is unknown due to inconvenient transportation and the need for several days for written messages to reach Hankou, the eastern Sichuan army, Wang Lingji and Fan Shaozeng's troops, have now crossed the Qu River and occupied Sanhui. Yang Sen's troops are also attacking Zhoukou, indicating that Suiding and Yingshan have not yet been completely recovered, and the distance to Xuanhan is even greater. On the northern front, the bandits first occupied Chengkou and continued to advance north. It is heard that they have reached Zhenba in southern Shaanxi. It is unpredictable where they will develop in the future. The central government has long been prepared for the bandits' northward flight. Yang Hucheng's troops have been ordered to station in Hanzhong and contact Feng Qincheng and other troops to strictly intercept them. Chiang Kai-shek, because the Sichuan armies were mostly waiting and watching, fearing that they would miss the military opportunity, telegraphed Liu Xiang, transferring the order to the armies to join forces to suppress the bandits. Yesterday, he telegraphed Liu again, reiterating the previous order, and said that if they continued to wait and watch and not advance, they would be dealt with by military law. Yang Deyuan, Chen Xingya, Yu Kedong, Wang Xiangting, Lei Biao, Li Anzhi, and Li Leifu were appointed as special commissioners to supervise the suppression of bandits in Sichuan, and Yang and others have already taken a ship west from Hankou on the 22nd. Now Chiang has also appointed Cheng Zerun as the special military commissioner stationed in Sichuan, stationed permanently in Sichuan, responsible for supervising the suppression of bandits, which shows Chiang's attention to the situation in Sichuan. He Long and Xia Xi's remnant bandits have recently been using all their strength to flee to Sichuan. He Long himself is still in Wangjiaying in Lichuan, directing the westward advance. Liu Xiang has sent the 21st Army, Chen's division, to meet them, and they have been in contact with one of the bandit groups in Tanxiangdong in eastern Sichuan. According to reports, the bandits retreated after being attacked, and the division has advanced to Lefudian, pressing on the main force of He's bandits in Jiannan. On the Hubei side, Xu Yuanquan is leading a large army to track and suppress them. After establishing contact with Chen's division, they will agree on a date for a general offensive. (23rd)</p>
<h3>He Chengjun Talks About the Fujian Incident, Says It Does Not Affect the Bandit Suppression Military Operations; Provinces Along the Yangtze River Will Request the Punishment of Chen</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: He Chengjun went to Jiangxi with Liu Zhenhua on the 15th to visit Chiang, and arrived in Nanchang on the 16th. During the meeting, Chiang gave detailed instructions on bandit suppression, post-war rehabilitation, local administration, and immigration. On the 22nd, He and Liu went to Xun together. On the 23rd, Liu took a ship from Xun to Anqing. He and Peng Zhenshan took the Jianguo ship west and arrived in Hankou at about 9 p.m. According to He, the bandit suppression and the Fujian incident can be summarized as follows: "The Fujian Incident was instigated by a few people. The doctrine they put forward has not gained the sympathy of all parties, and the elements are extremely complicated. Guangdong and Guangxi have expressed their opposition, and the elders have also criticized their fallacies. Mr. Hu Zhantang especially felt heartbroken that they openly abolished the party. It is expected that they will soon perish on their own, and it will have absolutely no impact on the overall situation and the bandit suppression military operations. The central government has decided to resolve this incident with political means, and does not want to lightly start a war. Internal and external troubles, mutually persecuting each other, water and drought successively arriving, people's lives are haggard. Unless absolutely necessary, they do not want to find another way other than peace. Chairman Chiang has always maintained calmness and ordered the generals of the Sichuan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Henan provinces to continue their efforts to complete the work of bandit suppression. Now the military in Jiangxi is winning victories, and the battle of Huwan completely defeated the pseudo-15th Army Corps. The bandit leaders Lin Biao and Peng Dehuai only escaped with their lives. More than 1,000 rifles, 100 machine guns, and countless other military supplies were captured, which is a new record of victory since the suppression of bandits. Other provinces have also made progress. Commander-in-Chief Liu Xueya will leave Xun for Anqing today to handle government affairs. After staying for a few days, he will return to his defense via Hankou. The rumors that he will be transferred are absolutely false. I will leave for the eastern and western Hubei provinces within days to inspect the bandit suppression situation and post-war progress. The return date to Hankou cannot be predetermined." That evening, Cao Haosen, Xia Douyin, Wan Yaohuang, Zhang Zhenhan, Shen Ke, and others went to He's private residence one after another to inquire about the Fujian incident. It is said that the seven provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Henan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang will jointly telegraph the central government, ordering the open punishment of Chen Mingshu and others.

<h3>Two New Plans of the Jiangsu Provincial Government: Organizing a Opium Prohibition Committee; Increasing the Authority of Various Commissioners</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: The Jiangsu Provincial Government has properly planned for matters concerning opium prohibition and the authority of supervising commissioners. The following is a brief description:</p>
<p>Eradicating Opium Addiction Throughout the Province After Chairman Chen took office, he believed that opium prohibition in the province had been lax in the past, and there were many malpractices. He now plans to organize a Opium Prohibition Committee in the provincial capital, and plans to establish branches in various counties. It is heard that the province will appoint the provincial government committee members as ex officio members, and add several leaders of French legal entities and local gentry in the provincial capital to participate. In addition to the county magistrate and public security bureau chief (or the section chief if the bureau is abolished) as ex officio members in various counties, several local legal entity leaders and gentry will also be added to participate. Each association will also set up an opium rehabilitation hospital. Those found to be smoking opium will first be sent to the hospital for rehabilitation, and then given appropriate punishment. It is also heard that Chairman Chen advocates for the sake of quick results, and plans to shorten the six-year prohibition period to four years, so as to eliminate opium addiction throughout the province within these four years, so that there will not be a single opium addict in the entire Jiangsu.</p>
<p>Increasing the Authority of Commissioners The province's supervising commissioners are divided into thirteen districts, and the county magistrate where the commissioner's office is located concurrently serves as the commissioner. After Chairman Chen took office, he believed that the commissioner system was very complete, but too many districts made the efficiency scattered, making it difficult to concentrate power. Moreover, once the commissioner concurrently serves as the county magistrate where the district is located, it is inevitable that obstruction will occur when supervising and directing other county magistrates. It is now heard that the number of supervising offices in the province will be reduced from thirteen districts to nine districts, and it is advocated that the commissioners should not concurrently serve as county magistrates. It is also planned to expand the authority and responsibilities of the commissioners. The commissioner's work location is not limited to being stationed in a certain county all the time, and it is also planned to set up a station in each county under its jurisdiction, so that each commissioner can move around and carefully observe all political affairs. The meaning is no different from the patrol road of the Qing Dynasty. The commissioners will also conduct a monthly inspection. If there is any corruption or improper handling by the county magistrates, they will be given guidance or punishment at any time. It is heard that Minister of Civil Affairs Gu also strongly agreed that the commissioner system must have the above-mentioned changes. Once all the committee members fully agree, it is expected that it can be implemented in January 1934.</p>
<h3>Change of District Head in Songjiang's First District</h3>
<p>Zhong Taichi, the district head of Songjiang's first district, has been in office for four years. Recently, rumors circulated that District Head Zhong had financial improprieties and embezzlements. Half a month ago, County Magistrate Jin summoned District Head Zhong for questioning about the facts. Immediately after, he requested the province to remove Zhong Taichi from his position and recommended Li Zufú and Dù Guī for approval. At 11 PM on the 23rd, the county government received an order from the province approving the removal of District Head Zhong and the appointment of Li Zufu to fill the vacancy. Yesterday morning, the new District Head Li received instructions from the county magistrate, requiring him to complete the handover by the morning of the 24th. District Head Zhong, citing insufficient time for preparation, negotiated a one-day extension. Consequently, it was decided that the handover would take place this morning.</p>
<h3>Filial Daughter in Wuxi Punished for Thinking of Her Mother</h3>
<p>Zhang, a woman from the back alley of Dongbeitang in the Sixth District, is 72 years old. Her daughter is married to Wang Qinren from Ao Qingpu. Wang used to be a section chief in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs during the Beijing government era and is currently managing donations in Beiping, earning a considerable income. Therefore, Zhang Wang has been living with her son-in-law and beloved daughter in Beiping. In May of this year, Wang's stomach illness recurred, and due to her advanced age and the inconvenience of living away from home, she returned to her hometown to recuperate. After three months of illness, she recently recovered. Her daughter in Beiping, missing her elderly mother and concerned about her recent recovery and the need for care, purchased two boxes of ginseng in Beiping. Considering that opium could also treat her mother's stomach illness, she specially prepared twelve opium pills, packed them inside the ginseng boxes, and sent them via express mail to Wuxi. The mailed package arrived in Wuxi the day before yesterday. Zhang Wang asked her neighbor, Peng Xinhè, to collect it from the post office without informing him of the package's contents. When Peng arrived at the post office, the staff, following protocol, asked what the package contained. Peng, taken aback and unaware, could not answer, raising suspicion. The post office then telegraphed the county court, which dispatched a prosecutor, a clerk, and bailiffs to the post office to jointly open and inspect the package. They discovered twelve opium pills and immediately took the witness to the court for interrogation. The court ordered Peng Xinhè to post bail and demanded that he bring Zhang Wang to court. Yesterday, Peng accompanied Zhang Wang to the court. The prosecutor interrogated them again, resulting in Peng Xinhè being dismissed, Zhang Wang being released on bail, the twelve opium pills being confiscated, and the two boxes of ginseng being returned to her.</p>
<h3>Bandit Executed in Hangzhou's Gudang</h3>
<p>Yuan Jintao, a resident near the Caishen Temple in Gudang, Hangzhou, was suddenly kidnapped by four bandits at around 6 PM on the 21st of this month. The bandits abducted Yuan and fled. After the incident was reported, the local defense corps, together with the military police, pursued the bandits and captured one, Yuan Jinshao, in Taoyuanling. The hostage took the opportunity to escape and return home. The captured bandit was taken to the security office for interrogation and confessed without hesitation. Yesterday (the 24th) at 4 PM, he was escorted to the scene of the crime in Gudang and executed by firing squad.</p>
<h3>Six Members of a Family Kidnapped Simultaneously in Jiaxing</h3>
<p>The town of Youchegang in this county is separated by a river from the town of Tianningzhuang in Jiashan. Recently, Tianningzhuang has been raising funds in the name of a public entertainment park, staging performances day and night. Dozens of residents from Youchegang are attracted to it day and night. The day before yesterday, a Mr. Shan, a visitor from Shaoxing, returned home late at night after watching a play. His entire family of six was kidnapped by bandits. Although three have been released, the whereabouts of the remaining three are still unknown. Chen Jingxian, the mayor of Chengxi (Youchegang), recognizing the seriousness of the situation, has telegraphed the provincial government, the Security Office, and the Department of Civil Affairs, urging the Jiashan County Government to immediately close the theater in Tianningzhen to eliminate hidden dangers.</p>
<h3>Fire at Yancang Bridge in Shaoxing</h3>
<p>A fire broke out in the Yancang Bridge area inside the Xiguo Gate of Shaoxing at around 6 PM on the 22nd. The fire originated in the Shan family's residence in Tangjiatai. Due to the prolonged lack of rain and extreme dryness, the fire spread to five or six neighboring houses, including those of Yu Yiran and others. With the arrival of firefighters from various locations, efforts were made to extinguish the fire. After two hours, the fire was finally put out. An estimated fifty to sixty houses were destroyed.</p>
<h3>Gambling Den Cracked Down in Lvsi, Nantong</h3>
<p>County Magistrate Cheng Yuyan and Provincial Committee Member Xu Youchuan went to inspect the rural areas and learned that there was a large gambling den in Lvsi, protected by the Public Security Bureau, operating openly with significant winnings and losses. They immediately dispatched a police team to surround and arrest the gamblers, capturing one thousand offenders and gambling paraphernalia. The owner, Sister Jiang Da, was sentenced to thirty days of detention, and the others were punished accordingly. Peng Tiesheng, the director of the Lvsi Public Security Bureau, was immediately dismissed from his post.</p>
<h3>Tragic News After the Kidnapping of Zhou Chengfang in Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Zhou Chengfang, a farmer from Sangshutou in the fourth district of this county, was kidnapped by dozens of bandits and taken to the Zhangjiaxia area of the district several days ago. The bandits repeatedly threatened his family, demanding a ransom of five thousand yuan. The family agreed to pay three thousand yuan, but the bandits refused. The day before yesterday, the bandits cruelly cut off Zhou's ears and sent him home, instructing his family to quickly prepare five thousand yuan for his ransom, or they would kill him. After speaking, they took Zhou away again.</p>
<h3>Yizheng Police Captain in Yangzhou Charged and Detained</h3>
<p>Shi Yujin, a resident of the northern part of Yizheng County, has been running a grain store for years. He was previously accused of being a bandit and smoking opium at the county police headquarters. The police captain, Chen Guoan, led the police to arrest Shi and then released him. After being released, Shi accused Captain Chen Guoan of soliciting a bribe of one thousand yuan during his detention, which constituted dereliction of duty and fraud. He filed a complaint with the High Court. After approval by the High Court, the Jiangdu Branch Court was designated as the receiving agency. Yesterday, the court session was held. After strict questioning, Shi Yujin was released on bail, and Chen Guoan provided a written guarantee of five hundred yuan. Since Chen had no guarantor, he was detained.</p>
<h3>Bandits Discovered in the Fifth District of Qingjiang</h3>
<p>The fifth district of Huaiyin County is vast and borders the three counties of Lianmu, Siyang. Bandit robberies occur from time to time. On the 22nd, bandits were discovered between Wulizhuang and Xuliu in the district, intending to cause trouble. Shen Bingchu, the captain of the local police brigade, upon receiving a report, immediately led a squad of mounted police and about a platoon of foot police towards the fifth district at 4 PM that day. He also mobilized various defense squads and security corps along the way to search and defend the area around Wulizhuang and Xuliu.</p>

<h3>News from This City: Chu Minyi Discusses the Central Government's Handling of the Fujian Incident, Wang Lunqin Arrives in Shanghai on the Jiangzhen Warship, Feng Yuxiang Has Not Left Mount Tai</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Mr. Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, arrived in Shanghai last night at 11 PM via a night train from Nanjing. He disembarked at the North Station at 7:30 AM this morning and returned to his private residence on Avenue Albert to rest. A Central News Agency reporter visited Mr. Chu this morning and inquired about the central government's measures to deal with the Fujian Incident. He provided a detailed response as follows:</p>
<h3>The Significance of the Fujian Incident is Particularly Serious</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Chu, the political changes in the past few years have all been internal party disputes. This time, however, it is different. Not only did they betray the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, abolish the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth flag, but they also colluded with the communists, recognizing the enemy as their father. All of this proves that they have betrayed the party, ruined the people, and attempted to overthrow the country. Therefore, the significance of this incident is more serious than any past party disputes.</p>
<h3>Most Heartbreaking: Material Support for the Communists</h3>
<p>Jiangxi Province has been blockading the communist areas for many months to cut off the communists' material supplies, in order to be able to eliminate them completely. This time, Fujian's collusion with the communists, providing them with material support, has destroyed months of blockade efforts in one fell swoop. This action not only affects the military's suppression of the communists but is also the most heartbreaking aspect of the Fujian Incident.</p>
<h3>Central Government's Separate Handling Methods</h3>
<p>The main figures in this Fujian Incident, such as Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, Chen Youren, etc., are all members of the Central Committee. Therefore, the central government first expelled the three from the party and handed them over to the government for strict arrest and punishment. Other party members who followed the rebellion will also be severely punished if they do not wake up. The central government had previously decided not to use force to deal with the Fujian Incident. However, if the Fujian army takes any aggressive actions, the central government will send troops to surround Fujian Province and strictly defend it. Orders have been issued to the military and political authorities to prepare and handle the situation as appropriate.</p>
<h3>Central Government Sends Personnel to Hong Kong to Welcome Hu</h3>
<p>The central government, recognizing the severity of the national crisis and the occurrence of the Fujian Incident, has decided to convene the Fourth Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Executive Committee on December 20 to unite and jointly discuss national salvation plans. It has also decided to send personnel to the south to urge Mr. Hu Zhan Tang and the Southwest Central Committee members to come to Nanjing early to discuss national affairs together. As for the candidates and the number of personnel, nothing has been decided yet. Central Committee members have suggested sending Mr. Wu Zhihui and Mr. Dai Jitao to Hong Kong. However, this matter is still awaiting discussion and agreement by the members of the Central Standing Committee before seeking their consent.</p>
<h3>Cracks Appear Within Fujian Province</h3>
<p>Currently, the Southwest region's attitude towards the Fujian Incident is completely consistent with that of the central government. As for the internal affairs of the 19th Route Army, cracks have also been discovered, because most officers and soldiers of the 19th Route Army are unwilling to sacrifice their glorious history for personal gain. Therefore, Fujian is not only isolated, but also experiencing internal changes, so it should be possible to eliminate it in the short term.</p>
<p>According to the China East News Agency, Naval Fortress Commander of Mawei, Li Mengbin, refused to cooperate with the Fujian faction, which led to conflict with the Fujian faction. All the Jiangzhen, Jiangyuan, Chuguan, Haining, and other warships that were formerly berthed in Mawei were nearly besieged when the Changmen Fort was occupied. Now, Mr. Li has led the Jiangyuan and other warships to arrive at Sandu to concentrate and await orders. The Jiangzhen has escaped danger and arrived in Shanghai yesterday. After the warship Jiangzhen arrived in Shanghai, a reporter from China East News Agency paid a special visit to Vice Captain Wang Lunqin of the warship to inquire about the details. According to him, the details were quite detailed and are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Seven Warships Berthing in Mawei Awaiting Orders</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Wang, the Jiangzhen, Jiangyuan, and Chuguan warships were originally suppressing bandits on the sea surface bordering Fujian and Xiamen. The Jiangzhen also carried a battalion of marines. Since the bandits have been thoroughly suppressed, the pirates in the sea area have been gradually cleared out. Therefore, it returned to Mawei and berthed in the river. In addition to the warships that berthed at Mawei, there were also the Jiangyuan, Chuguan, Haining, Haiou and other gunboats, as well as the Jingliang and Qingyun surveying ships.</p>
<h3>Tensions High: Prepare to Fire Up</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of the 18th, the banknotes of the Central Bank in Fuzhou could not be exchanged because the bank was taken over. At the same time, the Fujian side issued an announcement. Commander Li Mengbin, who was stationed at Mawei Port, specially summoned the captains of the warships stationed at the port to talk about the changes in the political situation in Fujian Province. All warships should prepare themselves and fully refuel with coal and water. Prepare to fire up in order to cope with the situation.</p>
<h3>Mr. Li Refuses to Cooperate with Fujian</h3>
<p>That night (the 18th night), this warship suddenly received an order from Commander Li to immediately go to Sandu. After receiving the order, it immediately left Majiang. The next day (the 19th) it arrived at Sandu. After the warship left, Lin Heyuan and Rong Yinglin (mistaken for Yun Yinglin) and several adjutants sent by the Fujian side went to the fortress headquarters to meet Commander Li. Their intention was to invite Commander Li and the navy in Fujian to join the cooperation. Mr. Li rejected it on the spot, saying that he could not betray the central government. At this point, Lin and Rong left in disappointment. Commander Li knew that the time was critical, and because the marines were dispersed in various places for bandit suppression, it was difficult to gather them together in a short time. Therefore, Commander Li boarded the Jiangyuan warship in preparation for responding to the situation.</p>
<h3>Resist for a Time, Fortress Occupied</h3>
<p>On the 20th, the Fujian side sent troops to the fortress headquarters to take over. Because there were only a few guards in the headquarters, they retreated after a slight resistance. At this time, the Changmen Fort was occupied, because there was only a battalion of marines stationed there. The disparity in strength was too great. It is now reported that the Fujian side has placed six cannons and four aircraft in the fort. At this time, because the Changmen Fort had fallen, the Jiangyuan and other warships were nearly besieged. After escaping, Mr. Li led the Chuguan, Haining and other warships to Sandu for assembly.</p>
<h3>The Haiou and Three Warships Were Indeed Detained</h3>
<p>When Commander Li left Mawei, the Jingsing and Qingyun surveying ships and the Haiou gunboat in the inner harbor of Mawei were unable to withdraw, so they were detained. In addition, the students of the Naval Academy and Principal Lin are still in Mawei and have not withdrawn. A battalion was disarmed and only lost a few rifles and machine guns. In addition, the personnel of the Majiang Shipyard have not withdrawn either.</p>
<h3>Fujian Has Sent People to Be the Fortress Commander</h3>
<p>When this warship arrived at Sandu on the 20th, Lin Bingzhou, the brigade commander of the Second Marine Brigade, was indeed in Sandu. His headquarters was also there. It is rumored that he has been commissioned by Fujian Province as the commander of the Marine Corps. I don't know about that. After the Changmen Fort was occupied, it was heard that Rong Yinglin was appointed as the fortress commander by the Fujian authorities. The Xiamen area is still calm. The Chuqian and Chutong warships are now berthed there.</p>
<h3>Li Mengbin Arrives in Sandu Awaiting Orders</h3>
<p>This warship was ordered by the Naval Department on the 21st to go to Nanjing. When it left Sandu, Commander Li happened to take the Jiangyuan warship and led the Chuguan, Haining and other warships to arrive there.

<h3>Li and Xue Deny That Feng Left Mount Tai</h3>
<p>According to the Far East News Agency, the Japanese News Agency in Tianjin transmitted a shocking message yesterday, saying that Feng Yuxiang suddenly disappeared from Mount Tai on the 20th. It was then said that Feng had disguised himself and gone to Taiyuan. A reporter from the Far East News Agency specially visited Mr. Li Liejun, a Central Committee member close to Mr. Feng, last night to ask about this. Mr. Li solemnly told the reporter that this was a rumor spread by the Japanese news agency and was absolutely untrue. I received a telegram from him sent from Mount Tai yesterday. The content of the telegram was a private discussion on the current situation, which proves that the claim that he left Mount Tai to go to Taiyuan is completely unfounded. The reporter then visited Mr. Xue Dubi, a Central Committee member. Mr. Xue also denied the previous claim in the same way.</p>
<h3>Mr. Gao Dengting Flew to Shanghai the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the Min Yan News Agency, after Fujian Province organized the People's Government, Sun Xiwén, a member of the Fujian Provincial Government and Director of the Construction Department, together with Chén Péikūn, Director of the Provincial Relief Office, fled to Shanghai on the Hua An Ship because they did not cooperate with the 19th Route Army. Gao Dengtan, a member of the Fujian Provincial Committee, was unable to take the ship, so he left Fujian on the China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Guangdong line plane on the 22nd and arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday at noon. Mr. Gao served as the Director of the Military Law Office of the Garrison Command when Mr. Tai Shizhe was the Commander of the Songhu Garrison. Mr. Gao's appointment as a member of the Fujian Provincial Committee in the recent reorganization of the Fujian Provincial Government was recommended by Chairman Jiang to the Chairman of Fujian, Jiang Guangnai. During the Fujian Incident, Mr. Gao's residence in Huangxiang, Fujian, was searched by the 19th Route Army. It is learned that after arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Gao took a fast train to Nanjing yesterday morning and then took a ship to Jiangxi to visit Jiang and report the truth of the Fujian Incident.</p>
<h3>The First District Party Department Sends a Telegram to the National Government</h3>
<p>To the Central Party Department and the National Government: Our country has been facing internal and external troubles for years, and the situation is becoming more and more critical. The national situation is like a pile of eggs. Without internal stability, there is no way to resist external aggression. Without saving the country, it is difficult to survive. Fortunately, our central government and national government, based on the great plan of saving the country, sent troops to suppress the bandits, winning victory after victory, and the pacification can be expected. At this moment when internal stability is about to be achieved, Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, etc., are either members of the Central Committee or hold important positions. Instead of thinking about being loyal to the party and the country and saving the people, they take the risk of doing things that are not right, seize Fujian Province, collude with reactionaries, act perversely, call soldiers to rebel, harm the country and the people, and their crimes are heinous. It is difficult to count their hair. Such rebels should no longer be tolerated. I implore the central government to send thunderous troops to launch a crusade, so that the evil people can be eliminated as soon as possible, the evil atmosphere can be cleared, the people of Fujian can be rescued from fire and water, and the country can be as stable as a rock. The party and the country are fortunate, and the people are fortunate. Sincerely, the First District Party Department of the Chinese Kuomintang in Shanghai.</p>

In the current situation of serious foreign aggression, how can we bear to see the image of disintegration again? We look up to the central government to plan and make plans, and to give immediate determination to the great plan of unification. The timing is urgent. We hope that the revolutionary unity spirit will be used to quickly rescue the declining national fortune in order to complete the Republic of China that Premier Sun Yat-sen painstakingly created. I dare to contribute my humble opinion and hope that you will take it into consideration. Sincerely, the Citizens' Federation of the First Special District of Shanghai."</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Fellow Association Sends a Telegram to the National Government</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Fellow Association in Shanghai sent a telegram to the National Government in Nanjing yesterday, saying: "We deeply alarmed by the news that Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and others used the 19th Route Army to establish the so-called People's Government in Fujian on the 20th. At a time when foreign aggression is imminent and the country is in danger, Chen and others do not focus on internal stability and external resistance, but collude with the Red Bandits to poison the local area, and establish different flags. Compatriots across the country are filled with indignation. I implore you to quickly establish a major plan to declare discipline and to curb chaos. I hereby send this telegram to express my deepest gratitude. Sincerely, the Jiangsu Fellow Association in Shanghai. Respectfully printed."</p>

Upon hearing the news, we are deeply saddened and indignant. After reading the recent situation, internal war is inevitable. The organization of your association is aimed at ending internal war. Please abide by this original intention and take immediate steps to eliminate internal strife, so as to relieve the people's suffering and maintain the national fortune. Approaching Ying, I cannot express the urgency enough. Women's Temperance Association, Chinese Women's Political Participation Association."</p>
<h3>The China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Guangdong Plane Encountered Danger on Zhoushan Island Yesterday Morning. The Sikorsky S-16 Plane Carried Passengers for the First Time. It Fell Due to Heavy Fog on the Sea and Was Severely Damaged. The Company Sent a Medical Car to Zapu for Rescue</h3>
<p>The China National Aviation Corporation's Sikorsky S-16 aircraft on the Shanghai-Guangdong route flew from Shanghai to Guangdong yesterday morning. Due to the bad weather and heavy fog, it turned back several times and finally encountered danger and crashed on the Zhoushan Islands. The company repeatedly sent planes to investigate and obtained confirmation. Then, it telegraphed and sent a medical car from Minhang to Zapu. It is not known whether the nine passengers and the American pilot, Mr. Rumil, were injured. Detailed reports have not been received until 10:30 PM. After hearing the news, the reporter met with Mr. Huang Jiangquan, Chairman of the Board, and Mr. Dai Enji, General Manager, to learn the details as follows:</p>
<h3>The Encounter</h3>
<p>China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Guangdong route, which travels back and forth between Shanghai and Guangzhou, has been in preparation for a long time. After a month of trial flights, it initially only carried mail and did not carry passengers. The trial operation was excellent. Only yesterday (24th) did it start carrying passengers. There were nine passengers. The new Sikorsky S-16 aircraft purchased from the United States was piloted by American pilot An Mu. It took off from Longhua at 6 AM. It turned back at 6:50 AM due to heavy fog. It took off again from the airport at 8 AM. It was not seen flying back at 9 AM. The company then telegraphed to inquire about the weather in Hangzhou and Wenzhou. The response was good, so it felt a little relieved. The company did not receive a radio report of the aircraft's whereabouts until 11 AM. The company then sent Mr. Ge Luoshu, director of the aviation group, to investigate by plane. He telegraphed back at 12:50 PM, saying that he had not found the whereabouts of the S-16 aircraft. It was not until 2:20 PM that he received a radio telegram from Mr. Ge, saying that he had discovered that the aircraft had crashed on the Zhoushan Islands in Zhejiang. Ge then drove back. He flew to Zhejiang again at about 4 PM to investigate. According to Mr. Ge's second telegram report,</p>
<h3>The Rescue</h3>
<p>Upon discovering the aircraft, the company immediately sent Chief Pilot Anderson to fly out. He flew back to Longhua at 5:30 PM. According to his report, the nine passengers had been helped by the local security corps and sent to the Zapu Hospital by civilian boats. After receiving the report, the company telegraphed Minhang and sent two medical cars to Zapu. The medical car left Min at 9:30 PM. It has not returned until 10:30 PM. According to General Manager Dai, the company has received a lot of help from all parties in Zapu in addition to the local security corps' efforts to assist after the aircraft encountered danger on Zhoushan Island. It is very promising.</p>
<h3>Huang and Dai's Talks</h3>
<p>According to Huang Jiangquan, Chairman of the Board of Directors of China National Aviation Corporation, and Dai Enji, General Manager, China National Aviation Corporation has been working hard on the aviation industry since its establishment. With the help of all parties, it has made rapid progress and has opened up the Shanghai-Chongqing and Shanghai-Beijing routes. There have been no accidents. This time, in order to connect the Shanghai-Guangdong transportation, the Shanghai-Guangdong route was officially carrying passengers for the first time today. Unexpectedly, due to the changing weather, this accident occurred, which is very regrettable. According to the S-16 aircraft, the manufacturing is extremely precise and strong. It was just purchased from the United States three months ago, and the equipment is quite complete. It uses dual motors and can fly an average of 120 miles per hour. Even if one motor is damaged, a single motor can still travel 85 miles per hour. It is also very stable. Pilot An Mu is American and has a lot of driving experience. This accident was really unexpected. However, accidents in aviation in various countries are not uncommon. The company sincerely hopes to deal with the aftermath properly and hopes that the Chinese people will understand.</p>
<h3>Continued Injury Report</h3>
<p>As the reporter was writing this article, he continued to be informed by China National Aviation Corporation by phone that there were a total of nine passengers in this accident. The more seriously injured were Yang Wenxin, the customs officer of Wenzhou Customs, and Miss Calase, the niece of British Ambassador Blue, and American pilot An Mu and Ehrnet were slightly injured. There were also Briton Reynald, German Schalser, and Chinese Yang Wenwu, Zhang Renwei, and Xu Da Jian, the eldest son of Xu Qianzhi, who were all fine.</p>

<h3>The Fujian Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai: Held a General Assembly Yesterday, More Than Eighty People Including Chen Qun Attended, Resolved to Send a Telegram to the Elders of the Province, Vowing Not to Cooperate with the Puppet Government</h3>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, the Fujian Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai, considering the serious situation of the Minbian Incident and the impending devastation of their homeland, convened a general assembly of Fujian fellow-provincials from home and abroad in Shanghai at 3:00 pm yesterday at the Sanshan Guild Hall on Fuzhou Road to discuss ways to save the province and the country. More than eighty people, including Chen Qun, Cai Minwei, Huang Jianzhong, and Zeng Rongpu, attended. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>List of Attendees</h3>
<p>The attendees at yesterday's meeting included Chen Qun, Zeng Rongpu, Xie Denan, Lin Jianming, Chen Changhou, Lin Youde, Xie Mingpo, Chen Cheng, Wang Weixian, Wang Xinyu, Wu Shengzhuang, Wang Yongjuan, Lin Shouchang, Gong Ming, Lin Zhan, Chen Baiyin, Sun Jing, Chen Naiqing, Lin Tian, Xie Yinpo, Lin Jinan, Chen Qiwen, Cheng Zhende, Chen Zaigen, Lin Baoming, Huang Jinfang, Huang Youqin, Chen Hua, Chen Qiming, Chen Shengguan, Lin Chengzhang, Chen Youbing, Huang Renfang, Zheng Yunqing, Jiang Zijing, Wan Lingyun, Su Biting, Su Jiwen, Zhang Zhizhou, Qiu Gang, Dai Ke, Lin Zhongwen, Liu Guoxing, Chen Shouwei, Zhou Bozi, Huang Jiaxiang, Zheng Zhongwu, Zheng Haomin, Wang Shudu, Zhan Yunwei, Wu Zuxian, Ke Zhuo'an, Liu Qiuting, Fang Faohou, Huang Renwu, Chen Runnan, Li Suixian, Zhang Binghui, Huang Zhanyun, Chen Shaohua, Wu Botong, Huang Yufu, Wang Hongxiang, Cheng Shichun, Lin Xingheng, Huang Jianzhong, Ma Zhengzhen, Lin Meicun, Chen Chengzhi, Lan Jingyu, Kang Qiutao, Sun Minwei, Chen Xinwu, Liu Depu, Lin Hesong, Shen Geng, Yao Zilun, Xu Shaoshan, Lin Songsheng, Cen Shaozhu, Zheng Ruoping, Chen Lin, and others, totaling more than eighty people.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>After the ceremony, Cai Minwei, Huang Jianzhong, Xie Denan, Huang Zhanyun, Chen Qun, Lin Shouchang, Xie Yinpo, Huang Jiaxiang, and Lin Jinan were elected as the presidium. Xie Yinpo reported on the purpose of the meeting, stating that they felt the greatest danger of the province and the country being lost. The so-called "People's Government" included members of the National Socialist Party, the Third Party, warlords, politicians, and corrupt officials. The complexity of its organization was imaginable. The recent situation in Fujian Province was serious and imminent. All fellow-provincials had relatives and friends in their hometowns, so how could they allow the so-called "People's Government" to devastate Fujian? Therefore, a general assembly was convened, hoping that everyone would express their opinions and discuss ways to save the province and the country.</p>
<h3>Mr. Chen's Report</h3>
<p>After the Chairman's report, a written report from Chen Peikun, Secretary of the Fujian Provincial Committee, was read out, stating, "To President Renhe, Greetings. I am writing in response to the letter from the Fujian Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai, convening a meeting at the Sanshan Guild Hall at 3:00 pm on the 24th. Kun and Shan originally intended to attend, but due to an matter, they had to go to Suzhou that evening and were unable to attend the meeting. Kun and Shan left the provincial capital on the 19th. Before the 20th, the People's Congress had not announced its purpose. Although there were rumors, the truth was unknown. However, the suspension of exchange at the Central Bank and the run on the Bank of China subsided. The market was still stable. Therefore, I am writing to inform you of the facts at the meeting. Sincerely, Chen Peikun and Wu Shan."</p>
<h3>Resolutions</h3>
<p>After the report, Chen Qun, Li Suixian, Chen Changhou, and others successively expressed their opinions. After summarizing the opinions of the participants and discussing them, the presidium immediately resolved: (1) To send a telegram to the elders of the province and overseas compatriots, vowing not to cooperate with the puppet government. The draft telegram is being drafted by the presidium. (2) To organize a joint association of Fujian organizations from home and abroad in Shanghai to preside over all response matters. The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 pm.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Finance Continues to Borrow 1.5 Million Yuan from Shanghai Money Shops: The Money Shops Indicate That It Is Difficult to Comply</h3>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi, due to the successive progress of the military campaign to suppress bandits and the post-war reconstruction of the recovered bandit areas, will use 5 million yuan of 22nd-year customs treasury bonds to borrow 2.5 million yuan in cash from Shanghai money shops to meet urgent needs. After the Money Shops Association convened an extraordinary meeting, it was resolved to lend 1 million yuan. On the 20th of this month, the money shops transferred the funds to the Money Shops Joint Reserve for remittance to the Ministry of Finance. According to reliable information obtained by the reporter of Dagong News Agency, Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi, considering that the expenses for suppressing the Red Army are enormous, in addition to borrowing 12.5 million yuan from the banking sector, at least 2.5 million yuan are still needed. At present, it is difficult for the money shops to agree to borrow 1 million yuan, but this is a drop in the bucket, or not a significant amount. Therefore, Finance Minister Kong sent another letter to the Money Shops Association a few days ago, requesting the industry to continue to borrow 1.5 million yuan in cash, so as to raise the original amount of 2.5 million yuan for payment. However, after receiving the letter, the money shops have indicated that they are unable to do so and it is difficult to comply. The reporter of Dagong News Agency inquired about everything from the Money Shops Association yesterday. The person in charge of the association replied that in recent years, due to the decline of commerce, the financial capacity of the money shops themselves has been affected by various factors and has repeatedly shown signs of exhaustion. This time, the Ministry of Finance borrowed 2.5 million yuan, and the money shops had already indicated that they were unable to handle it. After repeated discussions, the money shops reluctantly agreed to borrow 1 million yuan. The state treasury's deficit is important, but the difficulty of the money shops is also a reality. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance's request to borrow another 1.5 million yuan from the industry this time has made the money shops feel that they have done their best. It is difficult to comply and will politely explain the situation to the Ministry of Finance in the coming days, hoping to withdraw the order.</p>
<h3>Postal and Telecommunications Merger Conference: Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces Will Pilot First</h3>
<p>According to Huadong News Agency, the Ministry of Transportation recently ordered the merger of the postal and telecommunications organizations to save on expenses for both, on the one hand, to provide convenience to the public, and on the other hand, to save expenses. The Shanghai Postal General Bureau and the Telegraph Bureau held a meeting at the Telegraph Bureau yesterday afternoon to discuss the progress of this matter. The result was that Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces will pilot first. If the results are good, it will be promoted to the whole country, and various implementation steps will be decided. The reporter of Huadong News Agency learned the details from all parties as follows: After the Ministry of Transportation's Postal General Bureau and Telegraph Bureau of this city received the order, they held a meeting at the Telegraph Bureau yesterday. Zhu Menghou, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Postal Bureau, attended, and the Telegraph Bureau also sent representatives from the National Route Management Office to discuss how to merge. It was decided that both parties would investigate the situation and then discuss it again. However, the principle of merger has been decided. Jiangsu and Zhejiang will be piloted first, because the transportation network in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces is the most developed and because they are located in a strategic location. Therefore, it is planned to pilot first, and then promote it to other provinces if the results are good. The Postal Bureau and the Telegraph Bureau are currently drafting detailed rules for implementation and are submitting them to the Ministry of Transportation for approval.</p>
<p>Economic Independence The merger of the postal and telecommunications systems is intended to save expenses and provide convenience to citizens, but the economic aspects of both parties will remain independent and will not be merged. As for the expenses, they will be borne equally by both parties. The Postal Bureau has stated in advance that the merger should not increase the burden. If the telegraph branch office moves into the post office building, the extra expenses incurred by the post office should be borne by the Telegraph Bureau.</p>
<h3>Shao Lizi Passed Through Shanghai This Morning to Return to His Hometown: He Took a Train to Hangzhou and Then Returned to Shaoxing, Shao Delivered a Speech on the Train</h3>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, Shao Lizi, Chairman of Shaanxi Province, and his wife arrived in Shanghai by night express train yesterday (24th). After staying for more than an hour, they transferred to a train to Hangzhou and then returned to Shaoxing, their hometown. Shao told reporters at the station that his mother, Madam Zhang, passed away in May of the Republic of China's 14th year (1925), and nearly eight years have passed since then. He has been delinquent in not burying her. The reason is that he has been running around for years and has not had time to choose a burial place. His hometown is Shaoxian, and in Shaoxing, fields are often used as graves, which he has never advocated. It was not until he returned from Gansu this spring that he returned to Shao and chose a site in the mountains of Fusheng Township. He and his brother Boqian followed their late mother's lifelong thrift, love, and care, and decided to build a house nearby and start a rural primary school, and build a family cemetery near the tomb temple, named Tangsa Cemetery to commemorate their late father, Mr. Chengqi, who often called himself the owner of Tangsa during his lifetime. The funeral will be simple, and all superficialities will be abolished. No obituaries will be issued in advance, and no inscriptions or eulogies will be requested. He usually sees people soliciting inscriptions and eulogies, and he often does not know them. They repeatedly ask for help, adding to the extravagance, and some even have dozens of pages, bound into a thick volume. At this time of urgent difficulties, it is wrong to waste useful material resources on this kind of superficiality, and he does not dare to imitate it. After his mother passed away, he did not receive any money. This time, the funeral is simple and frugal. In the eyes of ordinary people, it seems extremely inappropriate as a son. He and his brother only want to do more beneficial things to comfort the spirit of their late mother. Therefore, if any relatives and friends offer generous gifts, please donate all of the cash to the fund for rural trivialities. In Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, he has already published a statement in Xilan Prefecture, and all of it will be transferred to charitable causes in those provinces. His ex-wife, Madam Tu Yuying, passed away 14 years ago and will also be buried on the same day.</p>
<h3>Newspapers Heavily Emphasize Huge Imports of Japanese Goods: The Hearts of Our People Are Dead, Japanese Merchants' Dumping Is Successful</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Shanghai Daily News, the total amount of goods imported from Japan to Shangwan in October was 20,500 tons. The number of imported ships in November was relatively small, but as of the 15th, it had reached 13,000 tons, and November and December have historically been the busiest months for transactions.

Recently, there has been a considerable amount of mirrors, needles, etc. imported. In the future, the variety of groceries can be increased. There is also a considerable amount to Hankou. At the same time, each scheduled ship transporting goods to Japan is fully loaded. The export volume in October reached 40,000 tons, the highest record since January of this year. Since November, many transaction contracts have been concluded, and both exports and imports are active.</p>

The Pudong Branch is arranging the installation of new equipment, and the installation of new equipment will begin next month. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>New Line Used for Telephone Calls Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau negotiated with the Telephone Company of the Concessions and paid to recover the cross-border water line directly connecting the Bund on Nanjing Road to Pudong. Then, it installed two new submarine lines at the Bund on Fuzhou Road and Jiangbian in Gaochang Temple, directly connecting to Pudong. The line on the Bund on Fuzhou Road is connected to the telephone of the Concessions, and the line in Gaochang Temple is connected to the telephone bureau of the Chinese community. On the 21st, the Engineering Department sent dozens of workers, hired small fire trucks and two sampans, and first installed the water cable from the Bund on Fuzhou Road to the opposite bank of Lanni Ferry, and then dismantled the old line. It was completed yesterday morning. From 1:00 pm, Pudong and Concession users used the new line to directly connect to Shanghai. The cross-river line from Jiangbian in Gaochang Temple to the coal company wharf in Zhoujiadu, Pudong, will continue to be laid this morning. The new line can also be used for telephone calls at the beginning of next month.</p>
<h3>Building Cables in Bailianjing</h3>
<p>Bailianjing Port is an important river in the inland port of Pudong. Factories, warehouses, and wharfs are lined up on both sides, but transportation equipment is still lacking. The Shanghai Telephone Bureau intends to install telephone engineering to develop urban transportation. It was originally planned to use overhead lines for connection, but because the port surface is wide, the project would be quite expensive. Therefore, it was changed to install a submarine cable across the river. All the village materials have been prepared and will be officially started next month.</p>
<h3>Branch Is Arranging the Layout</h3>
<p>The Pudong Branch of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, located on Dongchang Road, Pudong, has been repaired by the bureau and is now completed. It is currently arranging the internal equipment and will be established within the month. An 800-door power supply switchboard has been transported to the Pudong Branch and has begun to be configured. New user equipment will be installed at the beginning of next month.</p>
<h3>After China Merchants Bureau and Longhai Railway Coordinated Transportation, Tonghua Ship Returned to Shanghai from Haizhou Yesterday: The General Contract Will Be Signed and Each Route Will Be Implemented Next Month, Private Cooperation Will Study Freight Rates and Implement Competition</h3>
<p>According to Xinsheng News Agency, the state-run China Merchants Bureau has contracted to undertake the national water-land coordinated transportation, and various private shipping companies are vying to participate. Now the Longhai Railway has been implemented. Tonghua Ship returned to Shanghai from Haizhou last night. The coordinated transportation contract will be formally signed. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>General Cooperation Will Be Signed After the Board of Directors of China Merchants Bureau approved the water-land coordinated transportation contract, the Coordinated Transportation Office of the Ministry of Railways has rewritten the formal contract, which will be signed by Yu Yan, the director of the Coordinated Transportation Office, and then returned to Shanghai to be signed by Liu Hongsheng, the general manager. As for the coordinated transportation of Jiaoji, Pinghan, Jinghu, Huhangyong, and Beining Jinpu, the China Merchants Bureau is actively carrying out these matters separately, trying to fully implement it on December 1. The Ministry of Railways has scheduled a meeting in Beijing to discuss the private sector's request to participate in the coordinated transportation, and notified the China Merchants Bureau to send personnel to participate in the joint study.</p>
<p>Longhai Road Goods Congested After the Longhai Railway Administration and the China Merchants Bureau implemented the water-land coordinated transportation on the 20th of this month, the Longhai Road Shanghai Liaison Office and the China Merchants Bureau's Business Section received a telegram from Haizhou yesterday stating that the Tonghua Ship was fully loaded with about 1,000 tons of coordinated transportation goods and returned to Shanghai from the temporary coordinated transportation wharf in Laoyao Xunshengyou Mountain last night. It is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow morning and dock at Jinliyuan Wharf. As for the Yushun Ship, it arrived in Laoyao last night and started loading coordinated transportation goods this morning. It will return to Shanghai as soon as it is loaded. There are many coordinated transportation goods stored in the temporary warehouse in Laoyao. Therefore, this is the peak month for freight. The China Merchants Bureau will sail to Haizhou again to load goods after the Tonghua Ship arrives in Shanghai to unload the goods.</p>
<p>Private Sector Implements Cooperation In addition to the Chamber of Shipping sending telegrams to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Railways to strive for the private shipping companies to be allowed to participate in the coordinated transportation, they are also implementing cooperation, joining hands with each other, and unifying the freight rates. The private companies Shanghai Haizhou General China General Company and Dazhen Joint Company have sent personnel to Dapu to investigate the freight transportation in detail. And, in view of the fact that the water freight of the China Merchants Bureau's coordinated transportation goods is lower than before, in order to attract customers and develop business, it has been decided to jointly study the water freight to compete with the state-run China Merchants Bureau. At present, the Yongping Yong'an and other private ships sailing from Haizhou Dapu to Shanghai are also full of goods, but they are not coordinated transportation goods.</p>
<h3>Direct Transportation Method for Coordinated Transportation Parcels between Shanghai and Hankou: The Ministry of Railways Sets Ten Measures to Be Implemented before December 1, Yesterday It Ordered the Railway Bureau to Comply</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways believes that there are a large number of coordinated transportation parcels between Shanghai and Hankou, which are received and transferred repeatedly, and the procedures are complicated. It is now planned to use vehicles to directly transport them across the track, and ten direct transportation measures have been stipulated, which must be implemented before December 1 of this year. Yesterday, it specially ordered the Railway Bureau to comply with the procedures. The measures are recorded below: (1) Nine direct coordinated transportation parcel vehicles are required between Shanghai North Station and Dazhimen in Hankou. Three state-owned vehicles from the Pinghan Railway and two vehicles from each of the Jinghu, Jinpu, and Longhai Railways must be equipped with electric lights, wind brakes, and steam pipes. (2) These vehicles will each run one vehicle daily in opposite directions from Shanghai and Hankou, attached to the first or eleventh/twelfth train of the Pinghan Railway, the first or second train of the Longhai Railway, the first or second train of the Jinpu Railway, and the first or second train of the Jinghu Railway.</p>
<h3>Direct Ferry</h3>
<p>(3) These vehicles are exclusively used to carry coordinated transportation of parcels of the four railways or various parcels of this railway, mainly to load coordinated transportation of parcels as soon as possible. As for the parcels within this railway section, they are attached. When receiving and handing over coordinated transportation of parcels, all parties must strictly comply with the Ministry's issued measures for the acceptance and sealing of coordinated transportation of parcels. (4) For various parcels transported to stations where express trains do not stop, they should be handed over to the previous large station for collection and transfer. (5) The station and the escorting staff should fill in the handover certificate (format attached) when receiving and handing over parcels. If there is any damage, the handing over party should sign and seal in the additional notes column to clarify the responsibility, and the directors of both parties should seal as evidence and should not be arbitrarily signed to show caution. (6) The escorting personnel of these vehicles will be directly appointed by each railway to take care of the handover matters. (7) In addition to the dedicated escorting staff, who are responsible for the coordinated transportation of parcels, each railway will only load and unload parcels within its own section. (8) When the vehicles of each station drive to any railway, they should be subject to</p>
<h3>Command Inspection</h3>
<p>If any smuggling is found, it will be dealt with according to the regulations of the railway where it is located, and the business office of the railway in charge will be notified at the same time. (9) Each escorting staff should fill in the escorting manifest (Chinese) with carbon paper in five copies. The number of pieces, the name of the goods, the ticket number, the starting station or the end station, should be clearly filled in one by one. If there is any damage or error, the responsibility should be noted together. After the transportation is completed, the escorting staff will seal them separately in envelopes and send them to the business offices and coordinated transportation offices of the relevant railways for record. If any assistance occurs according to Article 8, the examining officer shall note the details of the discovery in the manifest, write his title, and affix a seal as proof. (10) The travel expenses of the escorting personnel sent by each railway shall be handled by the railway in charge.</p>
<h3>Ministry Order Stipulations: Capital Ferry Crossing Fees</h3>
<h3>First-Class Goods Subject to 100% Surcharge; Goods of Various Government Agencies Calculated According to Grading Table</h3>
<p>Regarding the matter of stipulating Yangtze River crossing fees for first-class and above goods transported by the Capital Railway Ferry, the Ministry of Railways yesterday specially instructed the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations to comply. The original text reads: "According to a telegram from the Jinpu Railway Administration Committee, the Yangtze River crossing fees for first-class and above goods transported by the Capital Ferry have not yet been stipulated. Furthermore, it is requested to indicate whether goods of various military and political agencies that are recorded on account, reduced in price, or free of charge, as well as military supplies or easily explosive goods, can cross the river, and how the crossing fees should be calculated and collected." In response, it is now stipulated that for goods with freight rates classified as first-class and above in the ordinary goods grading table that cross the river by ferry, the crossing fee should be calculated and collected based on the proportion of their revised freight rate exceeding the first-class goods freight rate, and then added to the first-class goods crossing fee. For example, goods with a doubled first-class rate should have their first-class goods crossing fee increased by 100%, and goods with a 50% increased first-class rate should have their first-class goods crossing fee increased by 50%. Furthermore, the crossing fees for goods of various military and political agencies that are recorded on account, reduced in price, or free of charge should be calculated according to the grade stipulated in the grading table. As for how to collect the crossing fees and whether explosives can cross the river by ferry, four detailed methods have already been stipulated in Instruction No. Ye Zi 6654, and all routes have been ordered to comply. The aforementioned request should be handled in accordance with the previous order. Based on the submission, all routes are hereby notified to comply. In addition to the directive, this order has been forwarded by the bureau to the Traffic Department for compliance.</p>
<h3>Railway Bureau: Additional Purchase of Railway Ferry Real Estate,</h3>
<h3>Totaling 25,232 Mu; Price Amounting to Over 90,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>To connect the Beijing-Shanghai and Tianjin-Pukou lines, the Ministry of Railways established the Capital Railway Ferry. Regarding the land for the ferry's connecting track lines, the Jinpu Railway Bureau was responsible for acquiring land on the Pukou side, and the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Bureau was responsible for acquiring land on the Xiaguan side. The land property rights belong to the railway bureau that made the acquisition. The two railway bureaus began conducting surveys, measurements, mapping, estimation, and table creation in the winter of the 19th year. Subsequently, they submitted requests for acquisition in accordance with the law. This included 49 households with buildings, covering a total area of 354.49 square meters, estimated to require 47,325.26 yuan. The land area was 25,232 mu, estimated to require 45,543.50 yuan. By the autumn of the 20th year, payment and acquisition were carried out in succession. This was interrupted by the January 28th Incident, but the original plan was resumed afterward, with additional purchases of real estate and increased subsidies. Therefore, there were slight discrepancies with the original figures. As of recently, a total of 45,780.14 yuan in silver dollars has been issued for real estate prices. According to the original estimate, approximately 47,000 yuan has not yet been issued. Currently, only a small number of properties remain, requiring negotiations with the owners to complete payment and other procedures, which should be completed soon. Recently, the Capital Railway Ferry Engineering Office requested additional land near the western side of the approach bridge for staff residences. The bureau is handling the survey and measurement, estimating that an additional 0.223 mu of land and three rooms covering 146.15 square meters will be required, with a total estimated price of over 1,800 yuan. After submitting to the ministry for approval, a public announcement will be made for acquisition in accordance with the law. The conclusion of this case should not be far off.</p>

<h3>National Federation of Commerce Requests Addition of Two Township Telegraph Offices;</h3>
<h3>Jie Shou and Si Shui Townships in Northern Jiangsu; Approved by the Ministry Yesterday</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Commerce, noting that the telegraph office in Jieshou Township, located on the border of Baoying and Gaoyou counties in northern Jiangsu Province, was suddenly removed during the dike breach in the autumn of the previous year, resulting in the severance of communication between tens of thousands of residents in the county's villages and townships and the outside world, causing significant delays, sent a telegram to the Ministry of Communications yesterday. They earnestly requested that the Jiangsu Telecommunications Administration restore the office and establish a telegraph office in Sishui Township, a more commercially developed area of Baoying County, to facilitate communication. The original telegram reads: "Respectfully to the Ministry of Communications in Nanjing, a telegram from Yan Zuobin, Executive Committee Member of the association, stated that transportation in Baoying and Gaoyou counties in northern Jiangsu Province is obstructed, with no railways or long-distance buses available. Normally, communication relies solely on wired telegraphs and postal services. In the autumn of the previous year, due to the dike breach, the telegraph office in Jieshou Township, located on the border of Gaoyou and Baoying, was suddenly removed, causing a sudden severance of communication between approximately one hundred villages and townships within a radius of one hundred and several tens of li, inhabited by hundreds of thousands of residents, and the outside world. Furthermore, there are no fewer than thirty to fifty thousand individuals in the various villages and townships engaged in military, political, academic, industrial, and commercial activities outside the region. Whenever urgent matters arise requiring telegrams, they are helpless and unable to seek assistance, causing significant delays. It is hoped not only that the Jieshou Township telegraph office will be restored to alleviate the hardship of delayed urgent matters but also that a telegraph office will be established in Sishui Township, a more commercially developed area of Baoying County, to promote the development of communication and benefit agriculture, industry, and commerce, etc. Based on this, we hereby submit a telegram to your ministry for review and earnestly request that the Jiangsu Telecommunications Administration establish telegraph offices in Jieshou and Sishui townships to facilitate communication. This is of utmost importance." Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce, bows.</p>
<h3>Unemployed Silver Furnace Workers Petition Yesterday,</h3>
<h3>Presenting Three Demands;</h3>
<h3>Requesting Immediate Order to Industry Directors to Comply</h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance explicitly ordered all silver furnaces in Shanghai to cease operations, over a thousand unemployed workers, facing difficult living conditions, formed the Shanghai Silver Furnace Industry Unemployed Workers Group and repeatedly requested mediation and subsidies from the Municipal Party Headquarters. After more than a month with no resolution, the group sent forty representatives to petition the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau again yesterday, submitting a petition to seek an early resolution. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Details of the Petition: Yesterday at 10:00 AM, the group sent forty representatives, including Jin Jiamao, led by their attorney Wu Yusheng, to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to petition. They were received by Section Chief Xu and Section Chief Wang Gang of the Mediation Division. Wu Yusheng presented the petition and submitted three demands: (1) Request that the industry directors be ordered to hand over all the union hall and productive property built by the workers' donations for sale and distribution to the unemployed workers for relief; (2) Request that the industry directors' unauthorized mortgage of 120,000 yuan in real estate be declared invalid; (3) Given the approaching cold weather, the workers have been unemployed for a long time and are suffering from hunger and cold. It is requested that the industry directors' representative Yao Daji be summoned to the bureau to guarantee compliance. Wang Gang indicated acceptance and promised to handle the matter as soon as possible. He also instructed the labor representatives to quickly compile a roster and thoroughly investigate and report all property for verification. At 11:00 AM, the group representatives, still led by Wu Yusheng, continued to petition the Municipal Party Headquarters, submitting the petition and demands. They were received by Lu Yinchu of the Civil Training Section, who agreed to immediately notify the Social Affairs Bureau by telephone to expedite the matter. The workers were satisfied and dispersed, also planning to thoroughly investigate the exact amount of the industry's assets for reporting and confiscation.</p>
<p>Text of the Petition: The petition presented by the group to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau yesterday is as follows: "Petition regarding industry directors occupying the union hall built by worker donations and mortgaging it for personal gain, urgently seeking relief." It is noted that the silver furnace industry, in compliance with the government's explicit order to abolish the tael and implement the yuan, has uniformly ceased operations. All unemployed silver furnace workers have specialized in this skill since childhood and have different circumstances from general workers changing professions. In October of this year, Jiamao and others petitioned for relief of unemployment, requesting that the industry directors sell the union hall and productive property (located at Chengda Lane, Jubao Li, 67 Tiantong Road, British Concession, consisting of a residential building and a public hall totaling 33 rooms, valued at over 30,000 yuan at current market prices) built by the workers' past wage donations and use the proceeds to compensate the unemployed workers. This is extremely simple and easy to accomplish. However, the industry directors forcibly occupied the union hall and refused to hand it over, colluding with one or two industry directors who were unaware of the situation to mortgage the union hall for 120,000 yuan. They returned half of the guaranteed deposit of 3,000 taels previously held by each silver furnace (i.e., 4,500 taels per furnace) to each furnace (traditionally, each silver furnace had to pay 3,000 taels to the guild when established, and half was returned upon closure). This time, the silver furnace closures were due to explicit government orders. Logically, returning 3,000 taels to each furnace would have been sufficient, but using their control of the property rights, they brazenly mortgaged it for 120,000 yuan, first recovering funds for the wealthy silver furnace owners, while the original donating workers requested uniform relief. They used various methods to perfunctorily delay. On the 3rd of this month, Jiamao and others were notified to invite the industry owner representative Yao Daji and others to the bureau to consult on everything in advance. Yao Daji and others, knowing that their reasons were unjust, agreed to provide concrete measures or further mortgage the property on the 10th of this month to provide relief to the unemployed workers. However, day after day passed with no news. Now that the weather is getting colder, they have been unemployed for a long time, their wives are crying, and their children are wailing, a tragic scene. The industry directors obtain funds for personal gain and each has their own wealth, but they stand idly by, regarding the situation as irrelevant. Jiamao and others are under unbearable pressure and are painfully exploited. They pen their grievances in tears, making a final plea, requesting your esteemed bureau to review and approve a meeting to express their grievances, promptly summoning the industry owner representative Yao Daji and others to the bureau for detention and requesting a letter to the Shanghai First Special District Local Court to seize the mortgaged union hall in advance, to prevent deception and provide relief."</p>

<h3>Cigarette Industry Petition Representatives Return to Shanghai,</h3>
<h3>Minister Kong Promises Joint Remediation</h3>
<p>Before the January 28th Incident, the Chinese cigarette industry had an annual sales increase of approximately 25%. Since the January 28th Incident, the market has been sluggish, and hand-rolled cigarettes and counterfeit cigarettes in various provinces have become increasingly prevalent. The impact of the tax increase in March of last year caused the machine-made cigarette business to plummet. Of the more than eighty cigarette factories in the past, only forty remain today, and only about twenty of them are still operating and barely maintaining their work. They are also worried and struggling to survive. The Chinese Cigarette Factory Industry Association, recognizing this critical situation, elected permanent committee members Wu Tingsheng, Bao Gengsheng, and Shen Weiting as petition representatives to go to Beijing and request the Ministry of Finance to quickly seek remedial measures. Minister Kong personally met with them and adopted the various points presented, promising to plan in detail and jointly seek remedies. The representatives, believing that the government intended to maintain the industry and that the cigarette factories may still have a chance of survival, returned to Shanghai to report and hold a meeting. The petition is recorded below. "Petition for Relief of the Cigarette Business and Regulations for Adjusting Machine-Made Cigarettes and Native Tobacco, Requesting Review and Approval." It is noted that the cigarette business has shown signs of decline since September 18th. After the Shanghai War reached a peace agreement, the tax increase order was issued again. Cigarette merchants had barely recovered and were unable to cope. However, given the urgent needs of the nation and the shortage of funds, they embraced the responsibility of every citizen and took patriotic measures to relieve the national crisis, reluctantly bearing the heavy taxes. However, since the tax increase on March 21st of last year, business has further declined. The reason is not only due to the sluggish social economy and the decline of rural areas, but the widespread use of hand-rolled native tobacco has also dealt a major blow to machine-made cigarettes. For example, in the eight provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, the native tobacco business is flourishing and difficult to eradicate. It is estimated that each province sells 1,500 boxes per month, with a total exceeding 10,000 boxes, which is alarming. Not only has the machine-made cigarette business suffered significant losses, but the reduction in tax revenue also amounts to 500,000 to 600,000 yuan per month. Moreover, the cigarette merchants' business has shrunk, but various expenses cannot be reduced, and the livelihood of the workers must be maintained. They are struggling to survive with great difficulty. If the production and sale of native tobacco can alleviate the livelihood of the poor, the resulting reduction in national tax revenue and the impact on the cigarette merchants' business rights are not worth the loss. Considering the advantages and disadvantages, it is felt that this is not a sustainable solution. Therefore, for mutual benefit, it seems that both sides should be considered. Here, we will briefly explain our views: (1) The current tax rate on hand-rolled native tobacco is lighter than that on machine-made cigarettes, but the actual tax payment is almost zero. Moreover, most native tobacco is counterfeit, directly infringing on the machine-made cigarette business. If this is not addressed soon, the machine-made cigarette industry will inevitably fail, native tobacco will rise to replace it, and national tax revenue will be significantly affected. This is not a mutually beneficial solution. The measures to address native tobacco are as follows: (a) The cigarette paper for machine-made cigarettes has always been white and should remain so in the future. (b) The cigarette paper for native tobacco, regardless of the color currently used, should be changed to yellow or blue in the future to facilitate distinction and prevent counterfeiting. (c) The native tobacco tax rate is set at 20 yuan per 50,000-cigarette box, but in reality, this is ineffective. The widespread use of native tobacco is closely related to this. Now, both for the sake of tax revenue and the machine-made cigarette industry, and for the sake of the livelihood of native tobacco farmers and the poor, it is proposed to reduce the native tobacco tax rate from 20 yuan to 10 yuan, or even 5 yuan, to make it easier to collect and prevent blatant tax evasion. If there are still violations or tax evasion, special provisions should be made to punish them accordingly. This approach would be both lenient and strict, ensuring that the production and sale of native tobacco does not affect national tax revenue and the machine-made cigarette business as severely as it does today. The credibility of government policies can also be maintained. The native tobacco tax can be added to the price of the cigarette paper (assuming each box requires 7 yuan of cigarette paper, add a 10 yuan tax, and sell the cigarette paper to native tobacco merchants for 17 yuan). The Tax Bureau will allocate funds to purchase the cigarette paper so that native tobacco merchants can purchase it from the local tax collection agencies. If they purchase it from others, it will be considered tax evasion. This procedure is simple and thorough, and tax revenue can be collected. It is truly a win-win situation, benefiting both the nation and the people. The impact of native tobacco on the machine-made cigarette business has been described above, and the increase in tax rates has also had a significant impact. Since the tax increase, the business has sharply declined, and the cigarette merchants have suffered losses. The unified tax revenue has also decreased. In areas that still operate under the old tax rate and have no tax evasion, the business is booming and tax revenue is increasing. They cannot be compared on the same day. Now, for the sake of the machine-made cigarette business and national tax revenue, it is proposed to restore the tax rate to the level before March 21st of last year, so that cigarette merchants can reduce their burden. If the tax rate is reduced and measures are taken to address native tobacco, the machine-made cigarette business will gradually return to its original state, and national tax revenue will also increase. Therefore, from the current situation, whether for the sake of tax revenue or cigarette merchants, it is necessary to adjust the tax rates on machine-made cigarettes and native tobacco. After the machine-made cigarette business recovers and is able to handle the burden, then further tax increases can be discussed, which can be promoted and fully implemented without causing public and private difficulties. The association is concerned about national tax revenue and the cigarette merchants' business and dares not remain silent. We respectfully submit this document, requesting your esteemed Minister to adopt and implement it to benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood. We are the people who have this concern." Respectfully submitted to the Minister of Finance, submitted by Wu Tingsheng, Chairman of the Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Factory Industry Association.</p>
<h3>Armed Robbery on Jessfield Road</h3>
<p>At around 10:00 PM last night, the home of Wang Zuojin, an Anhui native who owns the Wang Zhenchang Weaving Factory at No. 67 Qianjia Lane, Jessfield Road, Shanghai, was suddenly visited by four robbers speaking with a Jiangbei accent. Two robbers stood guard outside, while two others armed with guns entered the house, ordering the residents to remain silent. They ransacked the house, stealing 160 yuan in cash, a wool overcoat, and more than ten silk-lined garments before fleeing out the door. Upon receiving the report, the Sixth District immediately dispatched police to apprehend them, but they had already disappeared.</p>

<h3>High Second Branch Court</h3>
<h3>Tries Key Members of "Dog Beating Gang,"</h3>
<h3>Citing Complex Circumstances, No Outside Observation Allowed;</h3>
<h3>Western Detective Insults Reporter, Greatly Lacking Discretion;</h3>
<h3>Suspects Not Yet Sent to Public Security Bureau for Investigation</h3>
<p>Shanghai Public Security Bureau detectives previously arrested Cheng Xiangping (aka Chen Xiangping), a key Communist Party suspect, at the Xiaodongmen Central Hotel. Cheng confessed that accomplices were hiding in the Public Concession. Detectives from the Public Security Bureau immediately joined forces with Chinese and Western detectives from the Laoza Gate Police Station to arrest six accomplices - Ou Zhiguang, Zhang Yushan, Yuan Youfang, Zhang Dexin, Dong JiQuan, and a woman, Chen Zhang - in Room 40 of Longmen Road, Room 88 of Zaider Li on Chengdu Road, and Room 33 of the Zhongxing Hotel on Hankou Road. They seized seven pistols, four box cannons, three toxic gas pistols, two bombs, and over 1,000 rounds of ammunition, taking them back to the police station. Under interrogation, it was discovered that Ou and the other suspects had committed major crimes such as assassinations in the Concession. The next day, they were transferred to the High Second Branch Court. The Public Security Bureau prepared a document requesting their transfer, but the court ruled that because the suspects had committed major crimes in the Concession, it would expedite the interrogation by first concluding the Concession cases before transferring them to the Public Security Bureau. After investigation by the police, it was discovered that the defendants had a secret organization in the Concession called the "Dog Beating Gang," which aimed to assassinate political officials. They had committed eleven cases, including the murder of Huang Yonghua, director of the Public Security Bureau's Political Group, and his bodyguard Qian Rongqing, Central Commissioner Ma Shaowu (aka Lu Keqin), Gu Minghui, Wu Tian (aka Lei Dafu), and attempted assassinations of Zeng Boqian, Wu Xiu, Wang Shouxi, Hao Ming, He Jianqing, and a woman named Zhang Cao, all of whom were seriously injured. Yesterday morning was the scheduled trial date. At 10:00 AM, Yu Hua, the Criminal Division Chief of the High Second Branch Court, opened Criminal Division One to conduct the trial. Beforehand, the Public Security Bureau received a notification from the police, so they commissioned legal advisor James Ki Fong to attend the court with inspectors. Lawyer Li Zhishan represented the Municipal Council. Li Zhishan first stated that because the defendants were an important Communist Party group, he requested that public observation be prohibited. Judge Yu granted the request and ordered the spectators to leave. As the reporter rose from the seat and prepared to leave the courtroom, Logen, a Western detective from the Laoza Gate Police Station, suddenly stepped forward, pushed the reporter, and shouted in English, "Get Out!" Upon hearing this, the reporters believed that the power to maintain order in the courtroom belonged to the bailiffs and that the detective should not have intervened. Furthermore, the reporter had already risen from the seat and was about to leave, so the detective's harsh words were an insult to the reporter's dignity. They immediately questioned him, at which point Judge Yu heard the disturbance and asked Lawyer Li about the truth. The reporter explained the situation, and Judge Yu stated, "Since the police have requested to prohibit public observation, please leave the court." To respect the court's instructions, the reporter immediately left. Because the case was exceptionally complex, the trial took a considerable amount of time, so the suspects were not immediately sent to the Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Gasoline Price Increase Rumors</h3>
<h3>Soviet Oil Company to Reach Agreement with Anglo-American Oil Companies;</h3>
<h3>Those Enjoying Cheap Gasoline May Feel Disappointed</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that there are widespread rumors that Soviet Oil Company "Oil Everywhere" and Anglo-American Oil Companies in the Far East will soon reach an agreement. If this rumor is true, the period of cheap gasoline for car owners in Shanghai will soon end. Although people from Oil Everywhere and Anglo-American Oil Companies are denying that an agreement has been reached or will be reached soon, the rumor of a kerosene price increase occurred recently and was realized at the end of last week, with the price increasing from 5-5.2 yuan per ten gallons to 5.7 yuan. Now, there are rumors that Oil Everywhere, Mobil, Texaco, and Asiatic companies will reach an agreement by the beginning of December at the latest to increase gasoline prices. It is undeniable that Shanghai's gasoline prices are unusually low due to competition, and selling companies are losing several cents per gallon. It is also obvious that this suicidal policy cannot last indefinitely. Furthermore, since the merger of the Far East operations of the two companies represented by Mobil in September, they have been in a position to compete with other companies. At that time, there was talk that this could stabilize the Far East oil market. Although gasoline prices did not rise, they avoided further price cuts. Therefore, the price of 70 cents per gallon in September has been maintained until today. Previously, Soviet oil prices would be reduced by another five cents each time Anglo-American gasoline prices were cut to compete. As a result, the price fell from 1.30 yuan per gallon in the spring to 70 cents. The price war among oil companies in the Far East was originally started by Russian oil wanting to occupy a larger share of the Chinese market. The United States' recognition of the Soviet Union is expected to help resolve the dispute between the two countries' kerosene industries.</p>
<h3>Domestic Fruit Exported to England for Promotion</h3>
<h3>Shipment by Ship Next Month</h3>
<h3>Initially Testing Sales of Chestnuts, Pears, and Ginkgo Nuts</h3>
<h3>Sudden Outbreak of Fujian Incident Affects Fruit Merchants</h3>
<p>To develop China's foreign fruit trade, the Shanghai International Trade Bureau previously convened fruit merchants to discuss ways to expand business. It was decided to first test sales of chestnuts and ginkgo nuts in England. Fruit merchants have been actively preparing. It is learned that preparations have been completed and shipment by ship to England will begin next month. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Shipment Next Month: A reporter from the Dagon Association met with Mr. Zhu of the Fruit Industry Association, who said that the shipment of ginkgo nuts, pears, and other fruits to England for promotion has been decided. Three tons will be shipped initially for testing. They will be packed in wooden boxes, with lengths, widths, and thicknesses similar to those popular in the British market. Once the color advertisements are printed, shipment will begin next month. All customs clearance procedures have also been arranged.</p>
<p>Not Considering Profit or Loss: The English are fond of Chinese-produced chestnuts, with several hundred tons shipped to England from Singapore each year. Unfortunately, these are mostly sold by foreigners, and there is very little direct trade between Chinese and British merchants. Chestnuts account for most of these fruit exports. The fruit merchants only seek to expand sales and do not consider profit or loss. If necessary, they will send personnel to England to promote the advantages of Chinese fruits.</p>
<p>Impact of Fujian Incident: The oranges and olives sold in Shanghai are mostly imported from Fujian. Since the outbreak of the Fujian Incident, the supply has been cut off. Ships traveling between Xiamen and Shanghai, originally from Sanbei, China Merchants, Jardine Matheson, Chang'an, and other shipping companies, are now all suspended except for Jardine Matheson. If foreign ships are used to transport the fruits in the future, the shipping costs will be high, and the loading and unloading methods of foreign ships are inadequate. Therefore, Fujian-produced fruits may soon disappear from the market.</p>
<h3>Zhao Guirong Bravely Arrests a Thief and Loses His Life; The Thief Comes Face to Face and Shoots Him</h3>
<p>Zhao Guirong, a native of Funing, was 39 years old and worked as a laborer. He lived at No. 7, Tianfu Lane, Hanzhong Road, Zhabei. On the evening of the 20th of this month, at around 6 p.m., Zhao suddenly heard his neighbor shouting about a robbery. He bravely rushed out of his house and saw a thief running wildly towards him. Zhao went forward, intending to capture him. Unexpectedly, the thief, in desperation, pulled out a pistol and fired several shots at Zhao, all hitting vital spots. Zhao fell to the ground, covered in blood and unconscious. The thief took the opportunity to escape without a trace. His family then took Zhao to Baolong Hospital in the British Concession for treatment, but it was ineffective. He died of his injuries the day before yesterday. The hospital reported this to the Xinzha police station, which ordered detective Chen Shanji to investigate. The body was then taken to the forensic examination office on Fielun Road. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, was dispatched to the office to examine the body. After questioning Zhao Huang, the deceased's wife, who recounted the events, Guo concluded that the deceased Zhao Guirong died from gunshot wounds sustained during his lifetime. The body was handed over to his wife, Zhao Huang, who signed a document promising to arrange for the coffin and burial. It is understood that the authorities of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau in the Chinese area have arrested one thief since the incident occurred and are now strictly pursuing his accomplices.</p>
<h3>Famous French Novelist Arrives in Shanghai 丨Maurice Dekobra丨</h3>

It is said that he will stay in Shanghai for half a month.</p>
<h3>Questions About the Truck Abduction Case: No. 17622 is Found; Fear of Hijacking Opium or Seizing "Red Pills"</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, at around 4 p.m., the police stations in various districts of the Nanshi Public Security Bureau and the Public Concession suddenly received a phone call from the special agency of the French police, stating that an abduction case had occurred in the French Concession and that a truck with the number 17622 had gone missing. They were asked to pay attention and intercept it. At around 4:40 p.m., the truck was found within the jurisdiction of the Laoza police station. It was immediately detained and transferred to the French police. Upon hearing this, our reporter rushed to inquire from various sources, but the police were tight-lipped and even denied the incident, so the truth could not be ascertained. Some say that this matter does not seem to be an abduction case, as trucks are never used for kidnapping, and those riding in trucks are usually laborers or coolies who do not qualify as hostages. The content must be complicated, likely involving a strange drama of hijacking opium or seizing "red pill" drugs. This is recorded for future observation.</p>

<h3>Shangchuan Automobile Adds Special Bus Services and Reduces Second-Class Fares</h3>
<p>Shangchuan Automobile, as a general rule, from October 16th to March 15th of the following year, due to the gradual shortening of daylight hours, reduces one morning and one evening bus service. Now, the company believes that after the reduction of services, the arrival time in Shanghai for passengers from Chuansha and Nanhui is at 10 a.m., and those engaged in industry and commerce feel inconvenienced as the office hours have already passed. After investigating the situation, it seems necessary to add services. It has now been decided that from December 1st, a special bus service will be trialed once each from Chuansha Station at 7 a.m. and Qingning Temple Station at 8 a.m. Moreover, it has been found that most of the passengers on these buses are workers and various merchants in Shanghai. In these times of economic recession, although the original fare is already low, those who pay still find it difficult. The company, while facilitating transportation, also favors the common people. Therefore, a special fare for the special bus service has been set at 3.2 cents from Chuansha to Qingning Temple (a reduction of 1 cent from the original fare), with successive reductions for other stations. The same applies from Qingning Temple to Chuansha. However, this is limited to second-class and long-distance fares, while first-class and short-distance fares remain at the original price. It is said that negotiations have been held with the Municipal Ferry Management Office for joint tickets, and a report has been submitted to the Public Utilities Bureau for record.</p>
<h3>Important News from the Yangtze River Shipping Industry: Yangtze River Five Vessels Suspend Navigation</h3>

<h3>Rapid Drop in Water Level in Changsha</h3>
<p>The water level in Changsha, Hunan, has dropped significantly recently, making navigation difficult. Yesterday, various shipping companies in Shanghai received a telegram from Changsha stating that the river water at that port has receded to 2 feet 6 inches, and all merchant ships are blocked and unable to reach Changsha directly. All incoming and outgoing cargo is transported by iron barges. The six companies in Shanghai have specially agreed to increase the shallow water fee for Changsha by 30%, which has been notified to all customers.</p>
<h3>Qingpu's Cargo Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Sanbei Company's Qingpu ran aground in Digang on the 15th. After a week of salvage efforts, they were unsuccessful. After the Fuhua arrived in Digang and unloaded the cargo from the ship, another telegram was received yesterday stating that the cargo from the Qingpu's various holds would be transferred to the Xing Shi to be transported to Shanghai. The Songpu's attempt to tow the ship also failed. Now, the ship is aground with the bow in a corner, making it very dangerous. Due to the impact of the tide, there is a risk of capsizing. As a result, the chief shipowner, Pos, has decided to personally go to Digang today to inspect the situation and plan a rescue.</p>

It has long been famous and is popular with the police. In particular, Vita Cibaoming pills and injections have long been known throughout society. Even working day and night, they are still overwhelmed. It has recently been learned that the factory has specially sent expert technicians to the United States to study pharmacy in order to further their education and has purchased the latest equipment and machinery from the world's largest pharmaceutical factories in America, which has not been seen by our people. Most of it has already arrived in Shanghai and been installed, at great expense. The Vita Cibaoming produced by the factory, its Cibaoming cross-shaped endocrine crystals, and Wuling ovarian follicular endocrine crystals are unique products on the Chinese new drug market. In particular, the success of type B vitamin crystals caused a sensation at the time, as this type of crystal is still the latest invention in the world of science, and the factory succeeded first, which is worthy of praise. For this reason, both Chinese and Western physicians praised it, and the factory is the light of domestic new drugs.</p>

He resided in the front building of the second floor at No. 41, Taihe Lane, Bai'erbu Road, French Concession. He is currently performing comedy stand-up at the Tianyun Building Game Hall on the roof of the Wing On Company.

Yesterday, Ding was at home, taking advantage of the fact that his wife, Wang (46 years old, from Zhenjiang), had gone to visit their daughter, he was alone at home. In the afternoon, his illness relapsed again, and he suddenly had a suicidal thought. He used a rope to hang himself from the beam in the room behind the building, closing the door. It was not until 4:30 p.m., when the Wing On Company was waiting for him to go on stage, that he had not arrived for a long time. His apprentice, Sanbin, called by phone. The maid Wang Chen, who lived with the second landlord, answered the phone and went upstairs to call Ding, but there was no response for a long time, and the door was tightly closed. She then called the second landlord, Su Ming, to pry open the door and check. Ding was hanging himself. They immediately untied him, but it was too late because he had already stopped breathing. The second landlord reported to the French police, who sent detectives to investigate. After the police photographed the hanging body, the body was taken to the Second District Yuansheng Hall Forensic Examination Office for an examination. Today, it will be reported to the Second District Court for an examination before the body is prepared for burial. Ding had two sons and two daughters.

He immediately fell to the ground and soon died. After West Constable No. 116 investigated and found it, he used a vehicle to send him to Tongren Hospital and then transferred him to the Fielun Road Forensic Examination Office to await a report to the court for personnel to inspect.</p>
<h3>Red Pill Facility Cracked Down on Nanxun Road; Organized by Japanese Colluding with Chinese</h3>
<p>Lu Liankui, Chief Chinese Inspector of the General Inspectorate, learned that a Western-style house at No. 9 Nanxun Road was a large-scale opium substitute, red pill production facility, operated jointly by Japanese and Chinese. He obtained a search warrant from the court and notified the Japanese authorities. At around 7 p.m. the day before yesterday, he collaborated with West Detective Bo Pu, Chinese Detectives Liu Shaokui, Feng Zhiming, Song Bingzheng, and Japanese detectives from the police station to secretly raid the address. The house was a four-story Western-style building. They went straight up and found the door on the third floor locked, knowing that it was the location of the red pill production. They broke through the door and entered. The workers were busy collaborating and working very hard. They arrested workers Wu Qingsheng, Tan Afu, Dong Changsheng, Chen Acheng, Li Youle, Qiu Yuzhang, Wang Yulin, Wang Jinyi, and workers Wang Henian and Zhang Shengfa from the neighboring No. 10 Japanese residence, totaling ten people. They seized tens of thousands of red pills, worth a lot of money, as well as manufacturing equipment, iron pots, and drug materials. Together with the Japanese man named Abe Dokichi, they were taken to the Hongkou police station. The Japanese Abe was sent to the Japanese consulate for questioning, and Wu Qingsheng and others were detained. Yesterday, they were sent to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the previous situation and said that the defendants admitted at the police station that they were all manufacturing drugs at the facility. All the old workers were on the run. The Japanese Abe Dokichi directed the work, and the production of red pills was also done by the employer. These red pills were named "Senma Brand," and each large package contained 10,000 pills, which were widely sold on the market. He presented some of the machinery and two packages of Senma brand red pills that had been assembled for inspection, saying that there were still various iron pots, equipment, and red pills, the number of which was quite large, and it was inconvenient to bring them to court. It would be best to invite the court to conduct an on-site inspection. Judge Liu Yugui questioned each defendant and ordered them to be returned to custody for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Child Falls to Death from Window</h3>
<p>Zheng's son, named Guofa, only three years old, a resident of No. 59, Tongren Lane, East Wuchang Road, Hongkou, was swinging on the windowsill on the second floor of the house at noon the day before yesterday.

<h3>Evil Procuress Abuses Prostitute to Death; Final Verdict in Third Trial: Imprisonment for Fifteen Years</h3>
<p>Shi Zhang, a woman from Songjiang who previously lived in a pavilion room at No. 136, Tongzhi Lane, Aigre Road, French Concession, was 40 years old this year. She previously had several prostitutes in her home, who specialized in attending customers in various Han Zhuang. One of the prostitutes who sold herself, a woman named Xu Renbao from Liyang, was not good at catering to customers, resulting in a sluggish sex trade. This angered the evil procuress Zhang, who used cruel and vicious means to abuse and beat Renbao in every possible way, and also burned her with candle flames. As a result, she developed sores all over her body and was also stopped from eating, lying sick in bed. Unexpectedly, she was still often beaten to hasten her death. On April 10th of last year, she was discovered by a detective from the French police station, who detained Shi Zhang and sent her to the Second Special District Court, where she was prosecuted for injury. Renbao was sent to the hospital for treatment, but she died due to her serious injuries and illness. She was only 18 years old at the time of her death. Later, the police also changed the articles of prosecution and were sentenced to eight years imprisonment for injuring a person to death. Zhang refused to accept this and filed an appeal to the Higher Third Branch Court. After the trial, it was ruled that Zhang had intentionally committed murder, and the charge was changed to murder, with a sentence of life imprisonment. Zhang still refused to accept this and filed another appeal to the Supreme Court in Nanjing. This has been going on for a year and a half. Now, the Supreme Court has concluded the third trial and changed the sentence to 15 years of imprisonment for injury resulting in death. The judgment has already been delivered, and she will be sent to prison soon.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association Asks to Preserve the Space of the Lihao River</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association sent a quick mail telegram to the Zhejiang Provincial Government, the Yin County Government, the Administrative Inspector Commissioner's Office, and the Former Ningbo Property Clearance Office, saying: "According to a letter from the Yinxian Xianghao River River Works Post-Disaster Office, the city base along the Lihao River in Yin County has now been transformed into a ring road. There are still several feet of space between the road and the stone revetment along the river. It is said that the Former Ningbo Property Clearance Office has plans to auction off the land. It is found that the Lihao River is a gathering place for boats from the western part of Yin County and Fenghua. The loading and unloading of passengers and goods is extremely crowded. During the Republic of China in 1928, the local citizens presented to the municipal government to raise huge sums to repair the river after dredging, and then laid stone revetment to facilitate pedestrians and convenience of loading and unloading. The remaining space was originally planned to be planted with trees to provide a resting place for pedestrians. Now, due to the storage of goods and the flow of pedestrians, it has become a necessary land for the port. If the market is implemented and municipal houses are built, the transportation of the port will be adversely affected, and the land is not even a foot wide, one side facing the river and the other side next to the main city road. If buildings are built, it will hinder the view of the city. The boatmen from all the villages and Fenghua have donated money to the river dredging and revetment project, and they are extremely opposed to this move. For the sake of municipal administration and public opinion, it is necessary to reserve the land. Therefore, the association asked to take charge and quickly send telegrams to the Zhejiang Provincial Government, the Administrative Inspector Commissioner's Office, and the Yin County Government to stop the auction plan in order to maintain traffic and comply with public opinion. Sincerely awaiting orders," The Lihao River is indeed an important port for navigation in the western part of Yin County and Fengyi, and it occupies an important position in transportation. The claim that the land should be reserved for the sake of municipal administration and transportation is a legitimate one. According to the previous letter, in addition to sending telegrams, we urgently ask you to review and take charge, and quickly order the property office to stop the auction, which is a public convenience. Yu Hede, etc., of the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association, respectfully,</p>
<h3>Mongolian Border Northwest Exhibition to be Held at the People's Education Hall Starting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Shen Yiqian, Gu Tingpeng, Zhang Yu, and other students from the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts organized a National Crisis Propaganda Group this spring and went to North China, Northwest China, and Inner Mongolia to promote their cause. They also drew various sketches of the places. They plan to borrow the People's Education Hall on Wenmiao Road, Ximen, to hold an exhibition to promote their work. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Mongolian Border Sketches</h3>
<p>The group members are enthusiastic about researching the border areas and are also proficient in painting. Since organizing the National Crisis Propaganda Group and using art as propaganda, they have traveled through eleven provinces, covering 20,000 miles, and returned south in the autumn. They held an exhibition in Beijing, which was praised by all parties in Beijing. All the materials are mostly those that were not available in the previous exhibition. The depiction of Mongolian customs and conditions is quite vivid and can be used for reference by those who study Mongolia and are concerned about the situation on the border.</p>
<h3>Exhibition for Seven Days</h3>
<p>The organizer of the exhibition obtained an introduction from Mr. Zhang Yichen last month and planned to borrow the exhibition hall opposite the New World Company on Nanjing Road, but it was canceled due to other difficulties. Yesterday, the head of the group, Shen Yiqian, went to the People's Education Hall and discussed with the director of the hall, Mr. Chen Songchun, and obtained his agreement to borrow four or five exhibition rooms for the exhibition. There are more than 300 works from Mongolia and Northwest China, most of which are sketches of Inner Mongolia, as well as sketches of Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, Hebei, Shanxi, and Shaanxi, photography, text records, local product collections, etc., which are all rare and valuable materials. It will be exhibited for seven days from the 26th.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Fines on Qiongzhou Sugar Case: Sugar Guild Cables Ministry of Finance to Appeal</h3>
<p>The Qiongya sugar merchants transported domestic sugar to Shanghai, but the Jianghai Customs claimed it was mixed with foreign sugar and imposed a heavy fine. The merchants have been appealing for a long time, but there has been no result. It is now learned that the local Sugar Guild believes that this measure by the Customs is tantamount to destroying domestic sugar, and has sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance requesting correction. The original telegram is recorded below:</p>
<p>To the esteemed Ministry of Finance in Nanjing:</p>
<p>We have learned that the domestic sugar transported to Shanghai by Qiongya sugar merchants has been verified as genuine by the Beihai Customs. However, the Jianghai Customs insists that it is mixed with foreign sugar and has imposed a heavy fine, causing the sugar merchants to be fearful and dare not transport it anymore. We believe that domestic sugar is in the process of gradual recovery, and it is appropriate to support and cultivate it to promote its revival in order to achieve self-sufficiency and save foreign exchange. However, the Jianghai Customs has used the excuse of mixing with foreign sugar to arbitrarily impose fines. Is this not equivalent to promoting foreign sugar and helping its dumping? The future of domestic sugar is unimaginable. The guild has repeatedly reviewed the rationality of the merchant's appeals and deeply feels that the Jianghai Customs' measures are inappropriate and should be corrected immediately to show encouragement. However, for half a year, we have not received a correction from the ministry, and the fined money has not been ordered to be returned, causing the merchants to suffer immensely. The guild is concerned about domestic sugar and cannot help but feel apprehensive. Therefore, we earnestly appeal to the ministry to show compassion for domestic sugar, heed the requests of the Qiongya merchants, and make corrections.

<h3>Overseas Paris: The Course of the Chinese Painting Exhibition (1)</h3>
<p>(Paris Correspondence) The Sino-French University's office in France has prepared a report on the course of the Chinese painting exhibition in Paris, which is quite detailed. It is recorded below in sections.</p>
<p>In the winter of the 15th year of the Republic of China, Mr. Xu Beihong carried a part of his works and passed through Lyon. The colleagues of the Sino-French University asked him to hold a public exhibition, but he did not agree, and only displayed it in a room for people to view, which was highly praised by Chinese and foreign people. In the summer of the 19th year, Mr. Xie Shoukang was sent to Belgium and brought his works on his behalf, and held a "Xu Beihong Individual Exhibition" in this capital, which caused a sensation. After the exhibition, he also came to visit in person. In October of the same year, Mr. Hua Dabi transported Xu's works, except for those that had been sold in Belgium, to Zhi, and added a part of the products borrowed by Mr. Chu Minyi for China to participate in the Exhibition celebrating the Centennial of Belgian Independence. On the occasion of the Double Tenth Festival, it was displayed at the Lyon Sino-French University. Within three days, more than 4,000 people visited, and the newspapers gave enthusiastic publicity, and the reputation was very high. However, the people in Paris, the center of art, sighed that they had missed the opportunity. At the same time, the comrades in the academic circles of our country felt that Chinese art was quite necessary to be publicized abroad, so there was the brewing of the two exhibitions of Sino-German and Sino-French. In the summer of the 21st year, Mr. Li Shizeng came to Europe and then received a letter from Mr. Xu Beihong on August 7, which said that the Sino-French Painting Exhibition must be held, and entrusted Brother Hua Dabi to prepare everything and asked Mr. to discuss it with the French authorities. The main points are: (1) It must take the name of the Exhibition of Modern Chinese Art Collection of the Sino-French University in order to collect works; (2) It can be not open to the public to avoid disputes and the trouble of worthless works requiring to be added to the exhibition; (3) It is completely hosted by the Sino-French parties, and no irrelevant people participate. If it is approved, please show it before October, etc. On the same day, he sent the same letter to Mr. Liu Dabi, advocating that the National Museum of Modern Art of France, Roude Paume (TeudePaume, hereinafter referred to as Baum), should be the site of the exhibition, please urge it to be successful, and advise him to continue his efforts in foreign cultural undertakings, saying that returning is of no help to the crisis, etc. After receiving the letter, Mr. Li Shizeng extremely agreed, but advocated cooperation with the Sino-German Painting Exhibition and hosted by academic and art groups at home and abroad (such as Shanghai World Academy, Nanjing Central University, Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts, National Peiping Research Institute, Peiping Sino-French University, Suzhou Art School, Sino-French University's office in France, etc.) in order to strengthen the strength and facilitate the progress. In addition to replying to Mr. Xu by telegram, urging him to actively prepare, he also asked Mr. Liu Hou to postpone the return date to complete this task. This is the course of the preparation of the Sino-French Painting Exhibition. The organization of painting exhibitions by Chinese in France has been restored three times, but it has not been realized. The French side is very disappointed. This time, in the negotiation with the French government, the site was first proposed by Mr. Li Shizeng to Mr. Bo Lai, the president of the Paris World Academy, who agreed, and then instructed the secretary of the art department of the academy, Feng Du Jidi Si, to discuss with the French Deputy Minister of Art Education, Miss Lai, and the Director-General of the National Museum of Art, Mr. Fan Na. At first, Mr. Mi Fan and others were quite skeptical. After Mr. Liu's multiple explanations, Mr. Fan introduced him to Mr. Du Samaru, the curator of the Baum Museum. At that time, Mr. Du earnestly asked whether our association's organization funds had been settled, whether the morning exhibition works could represent Chinese art, and whether this organization could avoid repeating the previous mistakes, etc. He ordered several terms as left:</p>
<p>(1) The first floor of the Baum Museum is completely borrowed,</p>
<p>(2) The three exhibitions are scheduled between April 15th and May 15th,</p>
<p>(3) The pieces of the array must be selected representative works of pure Chinese art, which have not been Europeanized or Orientalized. The paintings must be 250 to 300 pieces, and they must be transported to France before March 15th.</p>
<p>(4) In addition to modern paintings, collect a number of ancient paintings, about to be displayed in a small room, for visitors to study the comparison of Chinese ancient and modern art,</p>
<p>(5) In addition to paintings, such as modern sculptures, porcelain, etc., those that can be representative works of the era should be collected and sent for display as much as possible.</p>
<p>(6) All organizational expenses are borne by the Chinese side. The catalog printing fee is allocated from the entrance ticket revenue. If there is any surplus, it should be paid into the French Treasury as usual.</p>
<p>The Baum Museum has two precedents for renting and borrowing. Renting means paying a monthly rent of 30,000 francs, and borrowing means that the entrance tickets of the exhibition are sold to them. At the beginning of our preparation for the painting exhibition, we suffered from the inability to pay the rent of 30,000 francs in advance, and we had no grasp of the results of the exhibition. At that time, we felt that borrowing the site was more free, but unexpectedly, the result was a great loss.</p>

<h3>Women's Basketball Match Results Yesterday: Liangliang Beat Meizhuan 43-22; Qiangnan Beat Guanghua 24-15; Jinan Beat Aiguo 34-14; Two A and B Matches Tonight</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Women's Basketball League is coming to an end. The A Division championship has been announced and has been won by Liangjiang again, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. In the B Division, Qiangdong currently has the most advantage. There was little interest in the three matches last night. Liangliang's victory over Meizhuan was quite easy, with a score of 43-22. Li Chuanai's steady shooting contributed as many as 22 points to Liangliang. The situation was more tense in Qiangnan vs. Guanghua. After Guanghua beat Jiangjiang 32-28 the other day, the morale of the team improved, but it was no match for Qiangnan, losing 15-24. In the A Division, Jinan vs. Aiguo, the referee's lack of energy made the game slow and dull. Aiguo resisted Jinan strongly, showing no weakness. Jinan won 34-14. The schedule for the two matches tonight is as follows:</p>
<p>Jiangjiang vs. Huadong (B) 5:30 PM Referee: Lu Xiangqian</p>

<h3>Chinese Walking Team Full Course Practice Tomorrow Veteran Zhou Yuyu Also Participates</h3>
<p>In order to prepare for the 10,000-meter walk in the next World Games, the Chinese Walking Association has organized a preparatory committee and scheduled a three-year plan to focus on the work. Starting in September of this year, they first practiced ten miles, and this month they practiced seventeen miles. They started practicing last week, and the results were very good. Tomorrow (Sunday) at 7:30 AM, they will practice again. Those who join must gather on time at the intersection of Tongfu Road and Xieqiao Road and wait for departure. The route remains the same, and the end point is still at the intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Mahuo Road. Veteran Zhou Yuyu will accompany the walking. However, Zhou was accidentally injured in his left arm by a truck while serving as a referee during the public competition on the 12th. He has not fully recovered and has not been able to practice for two weeks. But he is still coming enthusiastically, which is commendable. Shi Jinsheng, who announced his retirement, had boils on his shoulders last time, and his arms could not swing. He has been neglecting his training for years. Now he is slightly better and intends to continue walking. It is said that he has joined the 50,000-meter practice, which will make the strength of our Chinese team even stronger. It is possible to join the 17-mile practice tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Recent News on the Conclusion of the National Games</h3>
<p>After the closing of the National Games, in addition to requesting each group to compile reports, officials from the association were assigned to sort out or collect the meeting records, rules, photos and brief histories of officials and participating athletes, and various items related to the complete retreat. Ma Xiang of the Police Art Group has sent the group's report to the meeting. Xu Guan, the general leader of the Boy Scout Corps hired by the conference as the reception group, compiled a work report on the service of the Chinese Boy Scouts at the National Games and sent it to the meeting. The content of the report is: 1. Pre-event organization; 2. Camp layout and management; 3. Service overview; 4. Conclusion. It was found that those who participated in the Boy Scout service this time included the Chinese Boy Scout Headquarters (leader Xu Guanyu, Shanghai service member Wu Yaolin, bringing three tents), Nanjing City Council (leader and service members included Wang Xianzhang and others, bringing two tents, Zhongda Experimental School, Anhui, Zhongying, Sanmin, Yuqun and other middle schools, Veterans' School, Zhejiang Huzhou Middle School, Shanghai Dongya Sports College, Suzhou Zhongshan Sports College, Nanjing Liangguang Middle School, Lizhi Middle School, etc. The total number of service Boy Scouts above is 378, with 143 Boy Scouts rotating shifts every day, totaling 521, bringing a total of 49 tents, and a total of 29 leaders or service members. Due to geographical limitations, almost all were organized by the council and affiliated groups in Jing. However, in response to actual needs during the service period, there were often temporary increases, and the service period was quite long. Each group rotated its Boy Scouts to avoid affecting schoolwork. The Boy Scouts served for twelve days. Although the entire group of more than 500 people worked and camped for a long time, their health was not slightly damaged, and their spirit was increasingly expressed.</p>

<h3>Special Article: An Overview of Modern Chinese Educational Thought (7) - Narrated by Shu Xincheng, Recorded by Sun Yucai (5) The Period of Economic Revolution (Year 17 of the Republic, Year 22 of the Republic)</h3>
<p>Our country's adoption of the new education system was originally forced by foreign aggression. Thirty years ago, the ruling authorities, due to repeated diplomatic defeats, eagerly sought to strengthen the country. They vigorously promoted new education based on the reasoning that "virtue is the strongest force, and the system of schools is most detailed in virtue. Japan's rise was the quickest, and the number of schools is the highest among Eastern countries." As for the advantages of the new education, its effectiveness, and the social environment and historical background it required, there was neither the time nor the ability to consider them at the time. Thus, this "new education system, unsuited to the local conditions, was implemented in a state of indiscriminate adoption for more than thirty years. Because it was too unsuited to the local conditions, the results produced in more than thirty years were far from what society had expected." The education system was therefore constantly changing, and educational thought rose and fell in over a dozen ways as described in the previous article. However, the sacred myth of education still existed in the minds of the general public, and governance-oriented education, urban education, and talent education still maintained their traditional advantages and stood firm. Before the 17th year of the Republic, the various facts of education's ineffectiveness were indeed clearly visible, but because the people of the country eagerly anticipated the success of the National Revolution, they believed that everything in the country could be gradually improved by its success, and education could also be effective with the reform of politics. Unexpectedly, the objective environment did not allow the realization of subjective expectations. In the five years since then, from the perspective of the entire China, although there has been some progress, the effectiveness of education is still the same as before, and even less than before in some places. The most obvious fact is that in terms of social effectiveness, production is declining daily, and in terms of school outcomes, graduates have even fewer opportunities. As a result, the function of education has become something that people doubt and investigate, and the sacred concept of education has gradually diminished and broken down with the facts. At the same time, due to the "September 18th Incident" of the 20th year of the Republic and the "January 28th Incident" of the 21st year of the Republic in Shanghai, educational thought underwent drastic changes and new developments. Now I will summarize it in four aspects.</p>

<p>Radio Weekly</p>
<h3>Designing an Output Transformer</h3>
<p>— Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>In either DC or AC circuits, the larger the external resistance, the greater the voltage obtained; the smaller the external resistance, the greater the current obtained. If you want to get the maximum power, then the external resistance must be equal to the internal resistance of the power source. Everyone who has studied electrical engineering probably knows this basic law.</p>
<p>The first diagram shows the wiring method of the output circuit of a new AC radio. The output point XX is connected to the voice coil L of the loudspeaker through an output transformer T. Most people think that the function of the transformer T is only to protect the voice coil of the loudspeaker, but in fact it also shoulders a more important mission: to increase the output power and obtain the maximum undistorted volume. (Maximum Undistortod Power) If you don't believe it, try omitting the transformer T and connect the voice coil L of the loudspeaker directly into the output circuit, and you will immediately see a significant impact on the volume and sound quality.</p>
<p>The reason is very simple: the resistance of the voice coil of an ordinary electric loudspeaker is probably only about ten ohms, but the screen resistance of an ordinary vacuum tube is as high as several thousand ohms. Since the difference between the two is so great, the output power is naturally pitifully small. The best way to remedy this is of course to find a way to increase the resistance of the voice coil of the loudspeaker, but this is not easy to do in practice. So, thinking on the other hand, we can only use a transformer to reduce the vacuum tube's screen resistance to a considerable value.</p>
<p>We know that in a transformer, the more turns the coil has, the greater the voltage and the more the resistance; conversely, the fewer turns the coil has, the smaller the voltage and the less the resistance. In this way, we can solve the above-mentioned difficulty by using a transformer with a suitable ratio.</p>
<p>The design of the ratio of a typical output transformer is generally calculated according to the following formula:</p>
<p>For example, in the first figure, V is a 45 powerful output vacuum tube with a screen resistance of about two thousand ohms, and L is the loudspeaker voice coil with a resistance of about ten ohms. According to the above formula, we get:</p>
<p>Transformer Ratio</p>
<p>That is, in the situation shown in the first figure, you must use a 14:1 output transformer to get the maximum output power.</p>
<p>In a receiver, only the output power is required to be as large as possible, and the sound quality is irrelevant. But in a radio, on the one hand, it is required to be able to get the maximum output power, and on the other hand, the distortion of the sound quality must also be taken into account. According to practical experience, the load resistance must be twice the screen resistance of the vacuum tube in order to get the maximum undistorted output power.</p>
<p>Therefore, in a radio, the above-mentioned output transformer ratio should be changed to:</p>
<p>Transformer Ratio</p>
<p>That is, in order to get the maximum undistorted output power, you must use a 20:1 output transformer.</p>
<p>When the external resistance is twice the internal resistance, the output power is about 11% smaller than when the external resistance is equal to the internal resistance. Usually, a quarter of the power reduction only results in a small decibel loss in volume. The human ear cannot easily detect a loss of only one-tenth of the power.</p>
<p>In short, when designing an output transformer, the resistance of the primary coil should be large rather than small. According to practical experience, even if the load resistance is five times greater than the screen resistance, the difference in volume compared to when the internal and external resistances are equal is only about two decibels. Ordinary people probably need a change of three decibels to be able to distinguish the volume. If the load resistance is smaller than the internal screen resistance, then not only will the output volume be reduced, but also serious distortion will occur in the sound quality.</p>
<h3>Reviving Aging Vacuum Tubes</h3>
<p>— RF</p>
<p>If a vacuum tube is used carelessly and the filament receives a higher than specified voltage, the filament may not burn out, but it will lose its ability to detect or amplify. Or, due to prolonged use, the filament may naturally age and no longer detect or amplify. Both of these can be revived, and after revival, they can still be used normally. The method is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Pass a current that is about three-quarters higher than the specified filament voltage through the vacuum tube filament for a moment (for example, if the specified filament voltage of a 01A is 5 volts, you can pass a current of 8 volts through it. The shorter the energizing time, the better; otherwise, the vacuum tube may be burned out. Special attention must be paid to this point.) Then, pass a current according to the specified voltage through the filament for about two or three hours; then it can be used normally.</p>
<p>(2) This method is newly discovered and has a very good effect. (The author had a No. 1109 vacuum tube, which was greatly weakened due to accidental connection to high-voltage B battery, and the sound was as low as a mosquito's buzz, so it was abandoned for several years. The other day, while checking old items, I saw it and treated it with this method, and now it can be used normally, with effectiveness no less than a new vacuum tube.) The method is to use a blowtorch, the flame temperature of which is about 1200 degrees Celsius. (If there is no blowtorch, you can use a gasoline stove, a Bunsen burner used for chemical experiments, etc. A regular alcohol lamp can also be used reluctantly.) Slowly insert the top of the glass bulb of the damaged vacuum tube into the flame of the blowtorch, first gently heating it, and then applying more heat. Do not rush when doing this, so as to avoid the glass bulb bursting due to sudden heat. When the mercury layer on the vacuum tube bulb is partially vaporized by the heat, you should stop heating and let it cool down slowly. After cooling, its ability is no less than a new vacuum tube.</p>
<p>In general, seven or eight out of ten vacuum tubes whose filaments have not broken but are ineffective can be revived by one of the above two methods. With a few tens of minutes of effort, a vacuum tube that would otherwise be useless can be continued to be used. If a broken vacuum tube can save a few dollars, it will also slightly reduce the leakage of national wealth, so I have described it in detail above.</p>
<h3>Reviving Broken-Filament Vacuum Tubes</h3>
<p>— Chen Xianwen</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the vacuum tube is the heart of the radio, so you have to take care of it. However, even with a little carelessness, this omnipotent heart can lose its function. This causes a great economic loss to amateur researchers. To remedy this loss, one way is to prevent the misfortune from happening, and the other is to deal with the situation after the unfortunate event has occurred.</p>
<p>Everyone probably already knows how to prevent misfortune from happening (such as installing fuses in the B battery, etc.), so there is no need to say more now. What I want to talk about now is how to deal with it after the misfortune has happened. The method of treatment varies depending on the degree of damage. Now I will introduce the methods of treatment to everyone:</p>
<p>The method of reviving vacuum tubes whose filaments have not burned out has already been introduced above, but in the past, when a vacuum tube filament broke, this tube became useless. I have always wanted to revive them, but there was no safe method. Only now have I achieved success using the principle of electric welding. The equipment used is very simple, only an ordinary doorbell transformer and an interrupter (very similar to the vibrating device of a doorbell). Its circuit connection is shown in Figure 1. Its function is: when the intermittent current generated by the interrupter is sent into the primary coil (low-voltage coil) of the transformer, a high-voltage current is generated in its secondary coil (high-voltage coil). Then, this high-voltage current is sent into the filament of the vacuum tube, and an electric spark is generated at the break in the filament. When the electric spark is generated, strong heat is produced, which firmly welds the break in the filament. I have used this method to repair nine vacuum tubes for myself and my friends. Because this method can still be used in practice, I am announcing it to introduce it to everyone!</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<p>(A) The above method cannot be used to revive filaments that are no longer in their original position, or when the break in the filament is too far away.</p>
<p>(B) When welding vacuum tubes with higher filament current, the output current of the transformer secondary must also be larger, otherwise only electric sparks can be seen at the filament break and there is no possibility of welding. However, if welding filaments with lower filament current (such as RCA 201 and UX199, etc.), there is no need for a larger current. If it is too large, you will not get good results. Because the filament current is small, its diameter must be thin, and its heat of fusion is small.</p>
<p>(C) The current input to the primary of the transformer can be direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). However, it should be noted that: when using DC, there is no need for a larger voltage (a 12-volt battery is sufficient). When using AC, because the inductive reactance of the transformer and interrupter is very large, a higher voltage is required to be effective, about 40 volts.</p>
<p>(D) If the primary input of the transformer is alternating current, a large spark will be found in the spark gap (the interrupter). Not only will the surface of the vibrating reed be easily burned, but also because there is a discharge current passing through it, its intermittent current will not show a drastic change (such as from zero to maximum, or maximum to zero), so the output voltage of the transformer secondary will be greatly reduced. To avoid this drawback, a fixed capacitor (0.1 Mfd or 0.2 Mfd) can be connected in parallel at the spark gap, as shown by the dashed line in Figure 1.</p>
<h3>The Process of Manufacturing Fixed Resistors (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Ke Ming</p>
<p>The dried strips are now ready to undergo an important journey, that is, the white heat of a large furnace. These large furnaces have temperature controllers that can produce a constant temperature of over 2500 degrees Fahrenheit around the narrow holes in the furnace, through which the resistance strips are slowly passing. The embryonic resistors remain in this high heat for nearly an hour, and the degree of heat is such that the alloy supporting the outside of the belt is also burned to white heat.</p>
<p>The clay casing and the central resistance material are now fused into an inseparable, hard-as-stone resistor. Ordinary fire cannot harm it in the slightest, moisture cannot penetrate its dense ceramic, and ordinary overloads do not cause its permanent resistance to change.</p>
<p>The long strip of resistors is cut into appropriate lengths by a fast-rotating wheel, and then each section is sent to the laboratory for the first material test.</p>
<p>Many of the cut resistors are hung in a steel box, leaving only the ends exposed. The steel box is then moved along a chain in front of two nozzles that spray a layer of pure copper on the heads of the resistors to provide a base for subsequent welding. This metal spray requires an oxyacetylene flame (with a high temperature of 2400 degrees Celsius). The copper wire is fed into this flame at a steady pace, and the copper wire evaporates in this high heat and sprays onto the heads of the resistors, where it immediately hardens into a uniform coating. In this way, the resistor can last for a long time.</p>
<p>The resistors are then tested again and sorted according to value, and then, through complex mechanisms, the connecting wires are wound and welded. No corrosive solder is used, and they are inspected again before being coated with the appropriate colors according to the standard color code. (End)</p>
<h3>An Excellent Crystal Radio</h3>
<p>— Chun Gang</p>
<p>Because crystal radios are more popular among the masses, there are many people who play with crystal radios. It is very interesting to spend a small amount of money and be able to enjoy high-class entertainment. Moreover, crystal radios do not cost electricity, and once they are made, they can be used forever. But they also have some shortcomings, namely poor selectivity and low volume. This is really a big problem for crystal radios. Because volume and selectivity are relative, good volume means poor selectivity; good selectivity means low volume, and the two cannot be combined. The crystal radio diagram above was published in an old foreign magazine a few years ago, but I only know the circuit and can't remember anything else. Recently, because a friend asked me to make a crystal radio, I chose this circuit, and the results were surprisingly good, almost as good as a one-tube radio. Although the antenna I used is very good, it is at least several times better than an ordinary double-loop crystal radio, so I am introducing it to everyone.</p>
<p>The coil is made in a rocker drum style (like a three-loop style). The outer tube has a diameter of three inches, and the inner tube has a diameter of two and a half inches. The outer tube is wound with 26 enameled wire for 50 turns, with a tap every five turns. If you want to be more precise, you can make a tap every three turns. The inner tube is wound with 28 enameled wire for 25 turns, and taps are made like the outer tube, but the taps of the inner tube do not need to be too long, as long as they can be turned into right angles. After it is made, connect the coil head of the outer tube to the coil end of the inner tube in series, so that it becomes a single rotatable coil. Connect the taps of the inner and outer coils to a tap switch respectively for separate adjustment. C2, which is drawn with a dashed line in the diagram, can be added or not. However, when you install it, you may want to add one to try and see what the difference is. In the diagram, C is 0.0005 Mfd, C is 0.0001 Mfd.</p>
<p>Small Experiences</p>
<h3>The Frame of the Regeneration Coil Should Also Be Grounded</h3>
<p>— Zhu Ziyuan</p>
<p>A friend of mine recently installed a one-tube radio. The coil was a spiderweb type, and the regeneration coil could be rotated in and out. After installation and testing, he found that the human body had a very strong influence. Later, he grounded the moving plate of the variable capacitor. When adjusting the wavelength, the human body's influence was indeed gone. But when he went to adjust the regeneration coil, the human body's influence was still there. When adjusting to the point where the vacuum tube was about to oscillate but had not yet oscillated, as soon as he let go of his hand, either the regenerative power weakened, or the headphones screamed wildly. After fiddling around for a long time, he suspected that the copper frame of the regeneration coil was to blame, so he connected a wire from the copper frame to the ground wire. The human body's influence was indeed gone, and it was very convenient to adjust both the wavelength and the regenerative power. Therefore, he knew that the copper frame of the regeneration coil should also be grounded.</p>
<h3>Safe Screwdriver</h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>Ordinary screwdrivers only have insulation on the upper half, and the lower half is all conductive. If you are not careful when using them, a short circuit will occur, and vacuum tubes, coils, transformers, etc. may be burned. If you put a piece of rubber tubing of appropriate size and length on the conductor, you can avoid many unexpected losses.</p>
<h3>Common Sense</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiancun</p>
<p>(19) Overview of Vacuum Tubes (3)</p>
<p>(5) Structure of Pentodes: Pentodes are made by modifying the shortcomings of tetrodes. They can be divided into two major categories according to their different structures: American style and European style. (d) The above figure (A) is the common symbol for the American style, and (B) is the front view of its electrode configuration. The Radiotron brand sold on the market belongs to this type. (C) The figure is the common symbol for the European style, and (D) is the front view of its electrode configuration. The Philips brand belongs to this type. The difference in structure from tetrodes is that a third grid-like electrode is inserted between the screen grid and the plate, which is the so-called cathode grid. That is, it is composed of a filament F, a control grid CG, a screen grid SG, a cathode grid EG, and a plate P. This is a summary of the structure of pentodes.</p>
<p>(6) Operating Principle of Pentodes: As mentioned above, pentodes are made by modifying the shortcomings of tetrodes. The so-called shortcoming of tetrodes is the emission of secondary electrons. Originally, in tetrodes, if the plate voltage is lower than the screen grid voltage (a), another type of electron is emitted from the plate and flows into the screen grid. This phenomenon is called secondary emission. Therefore, a cathode grid is inserted into pentodes to eliminate the adverse phenomenon of secondary emission. The operating sequence is briefly described below:</p>
<p>If electricity is applied to the filament to heat it to a certain temperature, electrons are emitted from the filament. The speed of emission is increased by the presence of the screen grid SG, so the electrons pass through the control grid CG and the cathode grid EG and reach the plate P. Before the electrons reach the plate, although they have passed through the control grid and the screen grid, since the control grid is often supplied with a negative potential, there is no current flowing in the circuit of the control grid. Although the screen grid maintains a positive potential, the current flowing in the circuit of the screen grid is still very small, and with the help of the cathode grid, the secondary emission is eliminated. As a result, the plate current flowing in the plate circuit will inevitably increase greatly.</p>

<h3>Publicity</h3>
<p>— Yongzi</p>
<p>People are really too clever. Clearly a number one coward, so afraid that they don't even dare to fight back, yet they insist on saying that they are honest and incorruptible, with nothing but the clothes on their backs. Clearly a man who has a weakness for women, who cannot be a Liu Xiahui or a Lu man, yet they will trot out the Rites of the Duke of Zhou, and the saying "of the three unfilial acts, having no heir is the greatest" as a big signboard. Clearly physically weaker than others, so scared at the sight of someone rolling up their sleeves that they have already retreated more than half of three "li", yet they insist on saying they love peace and don't want to engage with people. Clearly with no money in their pockets, they still pat their pockets when passing by a large store, saying, "I just don't like spending a lot of money to buy this kind of stuff."</p>
<p>These posturing words are obviously lies to anyone with a clear eye, words that cost nothing to say. Those who say words that cost nothing to say are naturally not upper-class figures, and are naturally scum of society. But in this day and age, lying has actually become a fashionable game. Just like calling sexual intercourse by the euphemistic phrase "the Rites of the Duke of Zhou," saying words that cost nothing is called "publicity."</p>
<p>Speaking of publicity, it's a big deal, because although foreign countries have it too, it's not something that we in China have had since ancient times, so it's a completely genuine import. Imports are naturally more popular than domestic goods, so whoever knows how to lie will be believed, and will not have their credibility swept away. If someone knows how to do publicity, even if the publicity is about things that could never be achieved even in a dream, they will surely make the reporters of major newspapers use the largest headlines to print it out, so that readers can read it, marvel and applaud, and shout their approval.</p>
<p>According to some, in this day and age, nothing can do without publicity. Something as small as hawking five-spice peanuts and fried tofu must be publicized to the fullest, to make people who don't want to buy them salivate between their teeth, or else you can't expect anyone to take out their wallet. It goes without saying that publicity is even more important for big things. Publicity can turn the dead into the living.</p>
<h3>Pen, Skirt, and Gun</h3>
<p>— Ji Yu</p>
<p>Pen refers to a penholder, skirt to a skirt sash, and gun to a gun barrel. To further explain the following text, as the ancients said, "My pen is like a knife," and "One worn-out pen is worth more than three thousand Mausers." These are all deceptive words. Perhaps they had some effect in the past, but now they are completely wrong.</p>
<p>No matter how sharp your pen is, how capable it is of turning the dead into the living and the living into the dead, it cannot match the magic power of a skirt sash. To have the advantage of a skirt sash, you must first have a few beautiful sisters to offer to wealthy old men, doing them favors. This can be done on a large scale or a small scale. Relying on this sash that pulls connections, you are guaranteed a stable job, enjoying inexhaustible benefits for life. As for the gun barrel, it is the most powerful thing in the world. Everyone fears it. With a gun barrel, you can arbitrarily execute journalists. If someone tries to impeach you, it's like splashing white water on a white wall. If you lose one territory, you can immediately get another elsewhere. The gun barrel is feared not only by those with pens but even by those with skirt sashes! So, the pen is the most useless thing!</p>
<p>Nowadays, those who make a living by talking, such as ballad singers, comedians, and movie stars, only need to use their mouths and hands, without needing a pen at all. If business is good, they can earn one, two, three, or four thousand a month. On the other hand, painters and calligraphers who rely on pen and ink can only earn three or four thousand a year. (Some famous painters who used to earn four or five thousand a year now only earn two thousand or more.) As for those who make a living by writing, it is even more difficult. Earning sixty or seventy yuan a month is already shocking. Compared to those who make a living by talking or embracing, the difference is enormous! They earn in one month what writers earn in six or seven years. Even if you work day and night, from night to dawn, without eating or sleeping, you still can't catch up with them!</p>
<p>Alas! Today, those who wield pen and ink have reached the end of their era! Perhaps in the near future, the worn-out pen will have no place to stand! I think:</p>
<p>Rather than being rejected in the future, it is better to recognize the situation early and prepare a trash can immediately. Those willing to abandon their pens should take them and throw them into the trash can together.</p>
<h3>Triggering</h3>
<p>— Shen Shou Ruo</p>
<p>A beautiful scene in front of you vanishes in an instant! Only the painting can preserve the image forever.</p>
<p>The "we two" in the wedding advertisement is so intimate! The "we two" in the divorce advertisement is so reluctant!</p>
<p>Those who speak only for the rich and not for the poor often talk extravagantly about revolution and even manage to participate in it.</p>
<p>Judging from the surface of the character "朋" (friend), friends should only be made monthly, not annually, because as the relationship deepens, the affection becomes closer, and there may be concerns about starting as friends and ending as enemies!</p>
<h3>Four Company Commanders of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Nineteen: Wanting to Leave and Yet Longing to Stay, Recalling Past Events in the Same Car; Half Crying, Half Laughing, Leaning on a Pillow in a Sickly Autumn</p>
<p>However, Guizhi, while staying in the city, thought about her mother being alone at home and feeling lonely, so she insisted on returning after three days. Huang Manying saw her off at the tram station and then went back. Guizhi thought about how, the last time she and her mother came to the city, she had agreed to the Zhao family's marriage at the Huang's house. On the way home, she kept thinking about it. When she got home, she would inevitably feel embarrassed if she met Zhao and his son. How should she avoid it? But despite the difficulty, she was happy in her heart. Sitting on the tram and the car, she didn't feel much of the journey and arrived home in a daze. Recalling that scene, it was truly worth savoring. Now the road was still the same road, the tram was still the same tram, but having gone through it already, she couldn't help but feel sentimental. With a dispirited look, she arrived at Xizhimen and still lowered her head as she walked into the long-distance bus station. As soon as she entered, she heard someone gently call out, "Miss." She suddenly looked up and saw Gan Jizhi standing straight by the door. Guizhi was startled, took a step back, blushed, and said, "Second Master, long time no see, how are you?" Jizhi smiled and said, "We haven't been apart for long. I saw you in Haidian a few days ago." Guizhi remembered the day of the engagement and blushed even more. Jizhi said, "Miss has been in the city for several days and is only going back today." Guizhi said, "The hosts kept me from leaving, so I had no choice." As she finished speaking, she wondered, "How would he know that I've been in the city for several days?" So she smiled and said, "Did you run into me?" Jizhi smiled and said, "Although I didn't run into you, I received news the day you arrived in Beijing. It's rare that you still remember the place name Dahongmen." At this point, Guizhi suddenly understood. Yes, Ziqiang had said that he had recommended Gan Second Master to teach in Dahongmen, so she remembered such a place name. She had been surprised when she heard it on the tram that day and casually mentioned it. How did this news reach Gan Second Master's ears? (249)</p>
<h3>Self-Portrait Inscription</h3>
<p>— Chuan Yizhi</p>
<p>Friends like to take photos. If the photos are good, they are framed or mounted in silver frames, repeatedly admired, and repeatedly caressed, because they cherish themselves and thus cherish their photos. As for me? I am like a tear in the vast Gobi Desert, considering myself too insignificant. If I want to see my sorrowful face, worn out by life, I can simply use a mirror coated with mercury on the back. There is no need for the troublesome process of having a photographer capture it with a lens and print it on paper. Fortunately, I have already "kicked the bucket." It's like a grain of sand blown into the air by the wind and then sinking into the sea—clean and simple. Why leave a photo behind for the world to waste and despise? As for hoping to leave an image on porcelain for my descendants to offer incense and worship before it for generations, that would be even more ridiculous than Huan Sima preparing a stone coffin for himself. Moreover, it would burden myself and my descendants. I am not some "national hero" or "revolutionary martyr" whose photo can be printed by a publishing company and sold as a profitable commodity. This has no meaning or benefit for me or anyone else. So, I fundamentally dislike these bothersome things.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, Mr. Xinpu exceptionally used his own camera to take a two-and-a-half-inch full-body photo of me alone. Today it was finally developed. Looking at it, the stubbornly messy hair cannot hide the deep wrinkles on my forehead. These wrinkles are a record of a hard life, probably like the growth rings on a pine tree's cross-section, accumulating with the years! Two dark, inverted-eight-shaped eyebrows tightly cover two sunken eye sockets. The lower edges of the upper eyelids are each inlaid with a little shiny pupil, as if gazing intently at the direction of the final destination in the vast universe, or as if hinting to others at the difficulties of clearing thorns and the bitterness of one's own struggle failures. The cheeks are pathetically thin. The nose is high, and it doesn't seem unpleasant. The mouth is pursed shut as if containing anger. The ears only vaguely show a semi-elliptical shadow... This is not a suave, otherworldly appearance, nor is it a heroic posture full of spirit, and especially not a plump, happy, and long-lived face. It is the epitome of a genuine poor man whose courage has been broken by the demon's fangs and whose heart has been crushed by the boulders of life. Moreover, the small, square grid of the tall fence in the background symbolizes a net of troubles, further highlighting the outline of real life. I doubt if it is my own image. Looking in the mirror, I then believe that I am not what I used to be. If I have several years left, will I not resemble a skeleton? Alas! Premature aging, who is to blame?</p>
<p>I once compared myself to chopsticks, based on Yuan Zicai's poem about chopsticks. He said, "Laugh at you for being busy grabbing and sending food into other people's mouths; in a lifetime of sourness and saltiness, do you know what taste is?" Now, looking at this photo, I realize that being busy and getting nothing is like chopsticks, but even their quality of being strong and durable is far beyond my reach. Pitying myself in the "image," how can I not burst into tears!</p>

<h3>On Translation and Introduction</h3>
<p>— Mu Mutian</p>
<p>Fifteen years have passed since the May Fourth Movement. Since then, we have been gradually introducing Western literature to China. This time, almost twenty years, is not short. It should have been a considerable achievement in the introduction of Western literature. However, what is the actual situation?</p>
<p>None of Balzac's works have been fully translated into Chinese. None of Zola's novels have been fully translated into Chinese. Major works such as "The Decameron," "Don Quixote," "Gil Blas," "Satyricon," and "Les Misérables" either have only incomplete translations or, more often than not, don't even have incomplete translations. Apart from some Russian works translated indirectly by some people, there are even fewer works from other countries. Chinese translations not only fail to give a complete picture of Western literature, but also make it very difficult for young students to gain sufficient creative training from it. This is truly lamentable.</p>
<p>Indeed, introducing Western literature is not an easy task. In culturally backward China, introducing Western literature to a considerable extent cannot be achieved overnight. However, there are quite a few people in China capable of translating and introducing, and the past decade or so is not short. Yet, so few important works have been introduced. Although many reasons can be cited, the "comprador" attitude of many introducers is also a notable factor. Looking back, every friend has more or less committed this mistake.</p>
<p>By "comprador," I don't mean that the introducers and translators are "doing business." Rather, I mean that our introducers and translators have been doing their work under the influence of imperialism to varying degrees. Moreover, we are unconsciously affected by imperialism without even realizing it. One cannot help but lament "my unfortunate birth." In order to abandon the old tradition, we went to Europe to find new grain. But upon arriving in Europe, we were dazzled by a variety of colors and couldn't distinguish between genuine and fake goods. Imperialism showed us its kaleidoscope. We were captivated, our eyes were dazzled, and we said it was "beauty" and became "aesthetes." During the May Fourth Movement, we introduced Whitman and Wilde. Were we dazzled? When Hu Shi introduced Western novels, he didn't lead us to appreciate "The Decameron" or study Samuel Richardson and Fielding, but instead led us to know Kipling. What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>Of course, the social conditions in China also bear some responsibility for these tendencies. In China, the feudal remnants are too strong. Xu Zhimo's translation of Fouqué's "Undine" was not without reason. Balzac has not been translated into Chinese, while works by people like Labiche and Mendes have been translated to some extent, also for a reason. Because the cultural level of Chinese people is too low and their progressiveness is insufficient, imperialism has an opportunity to take advantage. Imperialists have unconsciously completed their task as "directors." We wanted to buy good goods, but as a result, we bought inferior goods.</p>
<p>The translation and introduction of Western literature are urgently needed in China now. But we want Western literary works to help the development of our own literature. During the Renaissance, European countries went to Italy to seek models. In the 18th century, English literature occupied a superior position in Europe. Naturally, China now needs to receive the influence of advanced countries. But we need to historically and objectively translate and introduce authentic works that can fully reflect society, and we should not let imperialist writers act as our "directors." We must always pay attention and be vigilant to prevent them from completing their task of "cultural aggression" through our translation and introduction. We must always be vigilant to prevent our translation and introduction from becoming "comprador"-like.</p>
<h3>Actors and Dancers</h3>
<p>— Sheng Fu</p>
<p>Actors and dancers are commonly referred to as "artists" in China. The only difference is that actors must put on a painted face when they appear on stage, hiding their true selves and posing as various characters to win applause from the audience. Dancers, on the other hand, are different. They don't hide themselves and sometimes even go so far as to strip naked, exposing their entire bodies. Although they inevitably put some powder on their legs, it doesn't detract from the true nature of their flesh. Therefore, spectators and critics often have overly harsh criticisms of the dancer's body, but they never see the hateful pockmarks and opium face on the leading male actor's face.</p>
<p>This is the secret of the painted face.</p>
<p>The Chinese have always been skilled in this art, and it is a genuine domestic product. Therefore, many clever people naturally want to cherish it and keep it as a national treasure.</p>
<p>As a result, painted faces are used in all kinds of grand occasions. Those who wear painted faces are naturally not all entertainers. Nor do they need to enter the Tianchan Stage. You can appreciate them everywhere.</p>
<p>Therefore, the scope of face critics has to be narrowed down to those who can't afford masks or completely naked dancers.</p>
<p>Recently, a "startling news" item was published in the newspaper, which attracted the attention of some people. The facts are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>At the Paris Dance Hall, dancers Yin Qiulian and Gao Lili were involved in a lawsuit over an assault case in the First Special District District Court. During the court hearing, Yin actually admitted to being a "Manchukuo" person. This surprised the defendant's lawyer "extremely," and many people denounced her in unison, almost stirring up the anti-traitor sentiment after the January 28th Incident.</p>
<p>This made me think that being a dancer is harder than being an actor, precisely because she can't be without a mask and is naked. If her profession had not been dancing but acting, she would have certainly been able to put on a show, saying, "She is a Manchukuo person, she is not a Manchukuo person," painting on a "unyielding," "no, no, unyielding," "master," and at the same time "slave" face.</p>
<p>But she doesn't know how to do this. She is actually regarded as a "slave," and even a "born" one. Even her parents feel quite dishonored. Moreover, the defendant's lawyer even said, "Manchukuo people certainly cannot be given legal protection," which also involves the risk that the assault case cannot be established, or even should bear the penalty for false accusation. It's really extremely unlucky.</p>
<p>However, I like her naked confession, not hiding in the least her willingness to be a slave of the Japanese Empire. Compared to some patriotic painted-face experts who swear oaths of love in front of people, but behind their backs fawn on foreign masters with servile faces, isn't she more lovable?</p>
<h3>Disturbance</h3>
<p>— Qing Nong</p>
<p>A disturbance arose in the communal courtyard this day.</p>
<p>In the early morning, the lovely autumn sun shone on the bungalows and low houses. Shortly after the "jazz music" had played, those large and small instruments, chamber pots, were still scattered in front of everyone's houses, sunbathing. The sister-in-law of "Wild Rose" upstairs, wearing a green-buttoned waistcoat, with disheveled hair, leaned on the iron railing, bent over, shaking her head, and brushing her teeth. The chaotic white toothpaste water dripped onto the stone slabs in front of the eaves downstairs with a crackling sound. The girl with two braids was drawing water by the well to wash vegetables first. The white-haired old woman in the low house had placed the washing board for washing clothes for others—the large wooden board that had become white and bright from washing clothes for so long—in front of the door and was about to lift the bucket and walk to the well to draw water. From the bend at the entrance came several burly men in black cloth gowns, including a foreigner in a Western suit. The children, who were excitedly half arguing and half playing marbles, stopped their active expressions when they saw this group of strangers, standing there in a daze.</p>
<p>"Foreign devil! What's the matter?" The little sister pointed her mouth at Little Shunzi's ear and asked softly. Little Shunzi looked carefully at the strangers, shook his head, and expressed that he didn't know.</p>
<p>"People from the yamen!" The girl with two braids quietly told the white-haired old woman who had walked to the well, with a surprised expression. As she spoke, she glanced at the "black cloth gowns."</p>
<p>The "black cloth gowns" confidently rushed into a room downstairs in the middle house. A surprised scream was heard from some auntie, followed by the shouts of the "black cloth gowns," "Don't move!"</p>
<p>The children stopped playing and gathered around. Little Shunzi squeezed into the room under the elbows of the "black cloth gowns" and was chased out with a shout. The little sister originally wanted to follow Little Shunzi in, but after hearing the shout, she couldn't help but be startled. Seeing Little Shunzi slip out and stick out his tongue, she was frightened, and her face changed from green to white.</p>
<p>The girl with two braids stood by the well, forgetting her work of washing vegetables, but the white-haired old woman didn't seem to feel anything and naturally drew water and washed clothes. The sister-in-law of "Wild Rose" upstairs squinted her eyes and watched, stopping her work of brushing her teeth, with the toothbrush still in her mouth, and the milky white toothpaste water dripping.</p>
<p>The people living in the middle house all gathered in the hall in front of the room being searched. The people from the houses on the left and right also ran out and stood outside their doors. However, the white-haired old man leisurely took out the spinning wheel from the low house, placed it in front of his door, sat down, and began his "violin solo"—the disturbance in the communal courtyard had nothing to do with him. They're searching for gambling! Big Sister's mother makes a living from this. Why don't they search her house? Looking around, Big Sister's mother isn't even in sight. Big Sister doesn't know where she's hiding.</p>
<p>The "black cloth gowns" shouted at the people gathered around watching the excitement, pushed them away, and walked out of the room. One of them was holding a wooden tray in his hand, filled with papers. That was probably the evidence. Some auntie followed them with a pale face.</p>
<p>"Go to the yamen!" The black cloth gowns said to her. She lowered her head and didn't say a word. She was probably imagining the humiliation of imprisonment and the pain of sitting in jail. Her eyes were moist.</p>
<p>The "black cloth gowns" left, and the auntie was gone. Only then did the people breathe a sigh of relief and speak, loudly.</p>
<p>"That's her old stash! I told her not to keep it, not to keep it, but she wouldn't listen!" Another auntie, who lived with that auntie, gestured and spoke to people.</p>
<p>Some people were sighing.</p>
<p>The children were already playing marbles on the dirt, and the white-haired old man's "violin solo" became more and more intense. The disturbance in the communal courtyard quickly subsided.</p>
<h3>Two Brothers (Thirty-Nine)</h3>
<p>— By Maupassant, Translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>They talked gently and intimately about ordinary things. The man's disposition had nothing extraordinary, but many gentle, tactful, and kind qualities. He was certainly a good friend to both of them, one of those good friends that one would never think twice about.</p>
<p>Now, many memories surged into Pierre's mind. Ma Raisa had seen him looking worried several times, guessed his poverty during his student days, and would voluntarily lend him money, perhaps several hundred francs. They had both forgotten about it, and he had never returned it. From this, it seemed that the man cared about his needs and had always loved him, always cared about him. Then... then why did he leave all his property to Jean? No, he had never shown more kindness to the younger brother than to the older brother, more concern for one than for the other, or outwardly more gentleness to one than to the other. Then... then... then he must have had a strong and secret reason to give everything to Jean—everything—and nothing to Pierre?</p>
<p>The more he thought about it, the more he revived the past few years, and the more he felt that Ma Raisa's differential treatment of the two brothers was inhuman and unbelievable.</p>
<p>An excruciating pain, an indescribable anguish that had penetrated deep into his chest, made his heart beat like a lock on a door being jiggled. The spring of this lock seemed to be broken, and blood flowed freely from there, shaking his heart restlessly.</p>
<p>So he said in a low voice, as if talking in a nightmare, "I must know for sure. God, I must know for sure."</p>
<p>Now he searched further, searching in the older days when his relatives were still living in Paris. But he couldn't remember their faces, which made his memories vague. He tried to remember whether Ma Raisa's hair was golden, chestnut, or black at that time. He couldn't remember after all. The man's last appearance, the old man's appearance, obliterated the appearances of other times. But he remembered that at that time he was thinner, his hands were very warm, and he often sent flowers, sending them frequently, because his father always said that sentence: "Sent flowers again! But you are a bit crazy, good friend, you will completely exhaust your money on roses."</p>
<p>Ma Raisa replied, "You don't care, I am happy to do this."</p>
<p>Suddenly, his mother's voice, the voice that smiled and said, "Thank you, my friend," pierced his mind. This voice was so clear, as if he could hear it. But she often said these two sentences, so it was so engraved in her son's memory!</p>
<p>From this, it seemed that Ma Raisa often sent flowers, he, a rich man, a gentleman, a customer, sent flowers to the old lady of this small shop, to the woman of the jewelry merchant in this cold village. Did he love her? If he did not love this woman, how could he have become friends with this merchant couple? He was an educated man with a rather refined nature. He and Pierre had talked countless times about poets and poems! He looked down on those authors who appeared in the guise of artists, but he greatly admired those authors who appeared in the guise of bourgeois. Doctors often couldn't help but smile at his actions, because in his opinion they were a bit silly. Now he realized that this affectionate and sentimental man had never been able to become his father's friend. His father was so practical, so vulgar, so stubborn. Poetry, in his view, was just equal to a kind of stupid thing.</p>

<h3>Exchange Rates of American Bank Continue to Fall; High of Five Yuan Nine Cents for Extra Charge; Doubts Arise with High Prices; Market Struggles to Advance</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market rose again, but people curbed their high expectations. Therefore, the market price approached 700 yuan. Initially, due to the consistent decline in overseas silver markets in Britain and America, the forward silver price at the Five Metals Exchange ranged from 0.93 to 1.13 cents. Exchange rates uniformly fell again. London gold spot price decreased by ten pence. The price of gold bought by US officials remained unchanged at 31.76 yuan. US wheat decreased by 3.375, US cotton fell by 16 points, and stocks decreased by 1.48 yuan. The wool market opened at 710 yuan, with goods priced at 13-14 yuan. However, major dealers like Dade Cheng supplied heavily, and although Bing Xing and Heng Xing absorbed some, prices still fell. After the opening, a Reuters telegram stated that directors of the US Federal Reserve Bank requested the government to establish sound currency and prevent the dollar from fluctuating, causing prices to rise. However, the increase did not exceed 10 yuan. Due to the hardening of exchange rates, high-priced supply sources were abundant. Silver companies and Jewish merchants, such as Qiao Zhifu and Xian Sai, could not support the gold market, and prices fell. Later, a Reuters telegram reported that the French cabinet had failed in its proposal to reduce salaries in the House of Representatives, leading to the resignation of the entire cabinet. Gold prices fell and then rose again. At noon, the market fell due to a supply agreement from the Western merchant Lallie. The market was stable in the afternoon, but Chinese merchants tended to sell, and banks had weak appetites for purchases. Silver companies also sold, and prices gradually declined, almost falling below the 700 yuan mark. The day's market was exceptionally weak, with the starting price at 1,110 yuan. A summary of the day's market conditions follows:</p>
<p>The morning opening was at 707 yuan, an increase of 11.13 yuan compared to the previous closing. Goods opened at the same price. The exchange market opened with a recent selling price of 1 shilling 3.25 pence for British currency and 33.5625 yuan for American currency. Bing Xing, Heng Tai, Yuan Mao, Yong Xian, and Jin gradually rose from 6.80 yuan to 9 yuan. Shanghai's March American gold was priced at 3.75, although it fell back to 7.50 yuan, it was expected that the exchange rate would rise due to the listing of British tax at 0.065 and the reduction of the US dollar. However, Dade Cheng repeatedly supplied, and Yi Feng, Yong Qian, and Chang successfully sold. Tong You listed March American gold at 4.375, a decrease of 5.50 yuan. Da Xing and Shui bought low, and after entering the market, the situation was calm, with prices hovering around 6 yuan for quite some time. When Yuan Chun, Yuan Mao, Yong Yi, Cheng Hong, Li Zhi Feng, and Yong Lai sold, prices fell to 4.30 yuan. Bing Xing and Yong Feng advanced to 5.40 yuan. However, due to the continued hardening of the domestic market, An Da and Hua Bi sold February American gold at 5.625. Qian Chang, Xiang Zhi Feng, Yong Yi Cheng, Yi Da Yong, and the Dalian gang jointly sold, and prices fell to 3.20 yuan. Da Xing, Yong Bing Xing, Yuan Mao, Yong Zhi Feng, Yong Heng, Yu Fu, Tai Heng, and Da Fa Yong competed, and prices rose to 7.30 yuan, due to a telegram about the cabinet crisis. Tong Tai Chang sold, and prices fell to 6.20 yuan. Yuan Mao Yong, Yuan Feng Yong, Heng Yu Yuan Sheng Yong, and others continued, and prices rose again to 7.70 yuan.

<p>The afternoon market opened at 705.12 yuan, with goods opening at 5.30 yuan. Heng Yu and Ri Chang advanced to 6.50 yuan.

Yi Feng Yong, Bing Xing Yuan Mao, Yong Heng Xing Hong Li, and Zhi Feng Yong jointly sold, and prices fell to 2.40 yuan. The Dalian gang and goods slightly bought, gradually returning to 3.90 yuan. However, Chang Sheng Yong, Hui Xiang, and Da Fa Yong continued to sell, and prices fell again, but still hovered. After entering the market, sentiment was extremely bad. Heng Yu and Fu Yu sold again, and retail investors heavily sold, and prices fell to 0.05 yuan. Mitsui took March American gold at 6.875, Hua Bi took 7.50, and Zheng Jin bought February American gold at 4.375. Heng Yu and Bing Xing limited their purchases and stabilized, and Hong Li and Zheng Chang also bought, and prices rose again to above 2 yuan. After struggling, the closing price was 701.60 yuan, and goods were auctioned at 1 yuan, finally around 1.5 yuan. The highest price of the day was 709 yuan, and the lowest was 700.05 yuan, a difference of 8.50 yuan. The result was an increase of 5.90 yuan compared to the previous closing.</p>
<p>The quoted price decreased by half a yuan due to the HSBC exchange rate listing of American currency at 33.25 yuan, equivalent to an additional charge of 721.80 yuan.

The registration price for this month was 719 yuan, for December 711 yuan, and for January 705 yuan. The morning water replenishment was 719 yuan, and the afternoon water replenishment was 716 yuan.

There was a lack of counterparties for swaps. Hui Xiang allocated 189 notes for December to Shen Kang, priced at 711 yuan for this month's notes, currently 1,225 notes, and 4,697 notes for December.</p>
<p>The market transaction was mediocre. Bing Xing Yuan, Jiaoyong Da Xing Yong Qian 14 were rejected. Chang Da Yuan Tong Tai were among the buyers. Shun Li Da De Cheng Yi Da Yong Da Fa Yong Da Chang Xiang Heng Tai Heng Yu Yuan Chun Yi Feng Yong Zhi Feng Yong Yi Cheng Hong Li Chang Sheng Yong Hui Xiang were among the sellers.

The Fu bang Sheng Da advanced over 100 notes. Heng Xing advanced a small number, retreating over 100 notes. The total number of January chips was 23,254 notes.</p>

<h3>Jiangnan Coin Fell in the Morning and Recovered at Noon</h3>

Copper coins remained unchanged at 3,003,500 texts, with transactions of over 30,300 strings, equivalent to 10,000 yuan in foreign currency.</p>
<h3>Securities Swap: The Previous Bond Market Continued to Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, the market was very busy with swaps between long and short positions due to the approaching end of the month for this month's futures. Market prices were quite abnormal, with more long positions being swapped, as it was still profitable to swap at the moment. If they could persist in swapping, they would eventually be successful, depending on their strength. The situation in Fujian Province did not change much. Although the central government and Guangdong Province were actively preparing for military action, they still hoped that Hu would arrive in Beijing and the matter could be resolved to avoid using force and causing hardship to the people. Therefore, there was still some hope for the future. The market situation was completely related to the number of chips. This phenomenon of squeezing long and short positions occurred every month's end. In the morning opening, the long positions knew that swapping was profitable, and many swapped to the near term, causing the market price to fall by a small amount of 0.03 to 0.04 yuan. Buyers mainly included numbers 3 and 53, followed by various others. Buyers saw a rebound of 0.03 to 0.04 yuan before the next round. After entering the market, the number of chips still exceeded demand, and the market turned weak again. In the afternoon round, the long positions swapped more actively. The difference between the near and far terms of demobilization was almost 1 yuan, indicating the enthusiasm of the long positions. Therefore, several types of futures for this month reached new lows. As a result, various other types also had stronger far terms than near terms. There was no need to be overly pessimistic about the future trend. Be cautious and prevent a sudden surge in the financial community, as their strength should not be underestimated. The market price ended with a continued decrease of 0.06 to 1 yuan, but the sharp drop of 1.8 yuan for this month's demobilization was somewhat excessive. The total transaction volume was 20,094,500 yuan, including 8,625,000 yuan for futures and salt tax, 2,875,000 yuan for demobilization, 2,045,000 yuan for 19 customs duties, 3,980,000 yuan for 20-roll 20 customs duties, and the rest ranged from tens of thousands to over 1 million.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Still Difficult to Advance</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that the New York stock market on the 23rd saw a reverse trend in inflation in various markets. The dollar strengthened and then loosened by several points to 4 yuan. The rise in the dollar was due to the fixed official price of gold, the opposition to the government's monetary policy buying back dollars abroad, and reports that Canadians were selling securities in Britain and taking funds back to New York. The demand for dollars was thus greatly increased. Speculators are now awaiting President Roosevelt's speech tomorrow night. The demand for stocks is very low before the monetary situation is clear. Grains, silver, cotton, and other goods all fell. French and Belgian bonds also softened. Steel stocks turned firm at the last minute due to purchases by the automobile and railway industries. "Wheat, a few long positions were slightly closed, and new buyers were disappointed. Clarifying the monetary situation to restore credit is the fundamental condition for the market to recover. "Cotton, long positions have too many chips, and with the growing opposition to the government's monetary policy and no progress in business, the market is weak and about to fall. New buyers are watching the situation and not moving forward. The Financial Relief Agency buys gold at a price of 33.76 yuan per ounce, unchanged. The Dow Jones indices are listed below, closing prices compared to the previous day:</p>
<p>Thirty industrial stocks: 98.59, down 1.48</p>
<p>Twenty railroad stocks: 38.89, down 0.73</p>
<p>Twenty utility stocks: 23.07, down 0.19</p>
<p>Forty bonds: 78.69, up 0.07</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Mills Refuse to Accept New Goods; Yarn Suddenly Tight in Recent Months; Forward Terms Weak Due to Current Situation</h3>
<p>The yarn market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon, but the November and December terms were quite expensive. There were conflicting rumors that some manufacturers had exclusively received 10,000 bales of old goods, and starting next month, they would refuse to accept new yarn. As a result, the market has suddenly tightened in the last two months. The long-term market has been affected by the current situation, and actual demand is not smooth. Therefore, new buyers feel very lacking. The current yarn market situation is unusually complex. Judging from the world situation, it is not appropriate to be overly optimistic.</p>
<h3>Varied Human Bids</h3>
<p>In the morning opening of human bids, the impact of the previous month's lingering high prices had not subsided, and retail investors were covering their positions. Foreign cotton prices tended to rise, unaffected by the decline in prices. Near-month prices rose by 0.086 to 0.01 yuan, and far-month prices rose by 0.03 to 0.04 yuan. In the afternoon, it was heard that actual demand was weak, and the market fell back. This month's prices rose by 0.04 yuan, and far-month prices fell by 0.03 to 0.046 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 35,500 bales. Sales included 600 bales of Rui Da, 1,200 bales of Chun Ji, 1,200 bales of Yu Da, 2,250 bales of Li Chang, 650 bales of Chang Yu, 1,650 bales of Heng Chang, 2,200 bales of Da Chang Cheng, and 800 bales of Tong Xing.

<p>Total 232,100</p>
<h3>Yarn Sales Still Weak</h3>
<p>The removal of existing yarn remains sluggish. The total purchases by various gangs for the day were 548 bales. Market conditions were similar to the previous day. The purchase amounts for each gang were as follows:</p>
<p>Nanjing 5 Guangdong 20 Luzhou 40 Huwu 1 Shantou 10</p>
<p>Anqing 10 Sichuan 50 Inland 367 Ningbo 25</p>
<h3>Mediocre Cotton Bids, Lacking Distinctiveness</h3>
<p>The cotton market remains flat and fluctuating, but with US cotton continuing to fall, the market atmosphere still seems to be declining. However, with the exchange rate slightly reducing, the exchange price is somewhat balanced. The existing cotton business on the market is quite quiet. All factories have no purchasing appetite. Japanese merchants are also watching for lower prices. However, general cotton merchants are absorbing and not releasing, so the market is currently hovering between 0.02 yuan.</p>
<h3>Zheng Bids Without Major Gains or Losses</h3>
<p>In the morning opening of Zheng bids, although US cotton continued to fall by 15 points and gold prices rebounded by 10 yuan, the long positions in the market bought and added to their positions. Prices for all months rose by 0.05 to 0.15 yuan. In the afternoon, this month's prices rose by 0.05 yuan, and far-month prices fell by 0.05 to 0.10 yuan.

<p>Total 709,100</p>
<h3>All Factory Demand Has Stopped</h3>
<p>Existing cotton transactions have completely stopped. Factorys' yarn sales routes are too narrow, they have absolutely no intention of taking in raw materials. The source of supply includes 1,542 bales of Yao cotton and 1,900 bales of Tongzhou cotton.</p>
<h3>US Cotton Fell Due to Long Positions Closing; British and Indian Cotton Slightly Improved</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market fell due to long positions closing and Wall Street weakness. As a result, spot prices fell by 15 points, and futures prices fell by 16 to 17 points. Liverpool cotton spot prices rose by 3 points, and futures prices all rose by 5 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 11 points. The Bombay cotton market rose due to short covering and Japanese merchant purchases. As a result, Pingar rose by 0.25 yuan, Omra rose by 1.5 rupees, and Bai Lokhi rose by 1.25 rupees.

<h3>Grain: Rumor of Tax Increase on Foreign Wheat to 4.5 Yuan; Standard Flour Moves Forward</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market conditions for each month showed a preliminary consolidation followed by a jump. With foreign wheat quotations, Chicago continued to decrease by a small amount of 1.1 yuan, and Canada decreased by about 0.03 to 0.04 yuan. The appetite for actual sales was not as urgent as before. Therefore, the market atmosphere was flat at the opening. However, outside parties and speculative long positions in the market believed that the wheat source was not abundant and factories were reluctant to release stocks, there must be a major reason. Therefore, they still competed to buy first in each round, with a huge quantity, causing the market to rise step by step. Until the afternoon opening, there were no special circumstances at first, but later it was rumored that the government's tax increase on foreign wheat would increase to 4.5 customs gold (equivalent to about 0.07 to 0.08 yuan in general silver dollars), so long-term sentiment was greatly shaken, and prices gradually rose sharply. January to April all broke through the 0.03 yuan mark. According to recent observations of sentiment, there may still be opportunities for both near and far terms to continue to rise. The spot price in Tianjin decreased again, currently only 2.5 yuan. As a result, this month increased by 0.004 yuan compared to the previous day, December increased by 0.00425 yuan, January increased by 0.004 yuan, February increased by 0.00625 yuan, March increased by 0.00575 yuan, and April increased by 0.0055 yuan.</p>
<h3>Wheat Jumps Up 0.08-0.09 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market, after the morning opening, each month initially showed signs of consolidation. With foreign wheat quotations, decreasing by 0.03-0.04 yuan to 1.1 yuan, so sentiment was still flat at the opening. Then, due to very few sellers and still enthusiastic buyers, and with the flour market initially consolidating and then jumping, the market in each round was also shaken. This was partly because the underlying supply was not abundant and partly because there was a rumor that foreign wheat would have a mutual quota tax increase. In the current situation where domestic wheat is falling, sentiment is easily aroused. As a result, November and December each increased by 0.08 yuan, January increased by 0.07 yuan, February increased by 0.09 yuan, and March increased by 0.06 yuan. The current wheat market has few transactions, and prices are still stable. Medium and inferior goods also rose gradually, with Chongming wheat opening at 4.15 yuan, Liuhe wheat at 4.1 yuan, and Hankou wheat at 3.98 yuan, totaling 1,300 bales, reportedly handled by Xin Da.</p>
<h3>Hexia Rice Continues to Fall by About 0.01 Yuan</h3>
<p>(Hunan) Yesterday, the source of supply was over forty shops, totaling over five thousand stone. The purchase route has turned languid. Although the Tianjin, Qingdao, and Yantai gangs purchased over three thousand bales (nearly four thousand stone), the trend has been downstream. The vessels were fully loaded and departed gradually, causing buyers to temporarily hesitate. As a result, the market turned weak. Yesterday, late rice continued to soften by approximately 0.01 yuan. The purchase appetite for Changbang, Sutongbang, and Nangang japonica at the local shops was still average, and the market price only softened a few cents to about 0.01 yuan. Du Yang tip goods were lacking, but the situation was not as firm as before. Although the Yin Yuan liquor shops transported goods, the market was still flat.</p>
<p>(Hubei) Yesterday, over forty ships arrived from Hexia. Sales on the market remained sluggish. Sales opened largely flat, with new japonica premium goods flat, medium and inferior goods improving by several cents in the morning but falling back by about 0.01 yuan in the afternoon. Du Bu Ke tip goods remained flat, and Bai Yuan and Yin Yuan improved by several cents.</p>
<h3>Peanuts Arrive in Large Quantities, Prices Fall by 0.10-0.20 Yuan</h3>
<p>Since new peanuts entered the market, the market has become increasingly stable, causing the price of raw peanuts at the place of origin to fluctuate. Therefore, merchants are mainly engaged in transporting peanuts, so the supply has been quite large recently. Although the shops on the street have tried to sell as much as possible, sales are not as smooth as before. Yesterday, transactions still totaled over 3,000 bales, and prices decreased by 0.10-0.20 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Refined White Sugar Improved by 0.05 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was stable and unchanged. The guild set the price for 24 coarse sand white ordinary goods at 20.2 yuan. Lotus red and Taikoo sugar were unchanged, with little movement. The price of Zhenji's No. 1 white sugar from the local factory was 19 yuan, an increase of 0.05 yuan. No. 2 was 18.8 yuan, No. 3 was 8.6 yuan, and No. 4 was 18.4 yuan. It was heard that Zhonghua and Guohua factories had decided to close down due to the recent repeated decline in sugar prices and the competition from certain factories selling at low prices, resulting in heavy losses. With reduced production in the future, market prices may increase. Chen Chaoqing continued to be available, priced at 15.4 yuan.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods: Old Dried Longans Arrive and are Sold Immediately</h3>
<p>Only about 200 boxes of Quanzhou large dried longans arrived the day before yesterday. Due to recent low sales of new goods, most of this batch was old goods. Yesterday, most of them were sold, with the best quality priced at 45-46 yuan, followed by prices ranging from 32-33 yuan to around 10 yuan, trending flat.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Suits and Overcoat Woolens Sell Well and are Firm</h3>
<p>Since riding breeches and overcoats have become popular, Chinese-style overcoats have abandoned thick materials for thin ones. Therefore, the sales force of ordinary mass-market overcoat woolens has suddenly become sluggish. However, high-end pure wool suits and fancy woolens for Western clothing tailors still have strong purchase appetite, so their sales are still smooth. Black and white plaid and herringbone suit and overcoat woolens priced at over 10 yuan per yard have been selling well recently. Pure wool black and white plaid overcoat woolens at Friendship Company sell for 24 yuan per yard, while Japanese goods sell for 15 yuan. The trend is very active.</p>
<h3>Urgent Relief Needed for Silk and Tea Industries</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry is developing sales of Chinese silk to the United States, which has been the largest consumer of raw silk in the world. Our country's silk sales to the United States account for sixty percent of the total. However, after Japanese silk began to compete with low prices in the American market, Chinese silk sales slowed down. Now, they have plummeted. Silk prices have fallen drastically, and the silk industry is on the verge of bankruptcy. Silk industry associations in Jiangsu and Zhejiang are currently appealing to the government to find ways to provide relief. According to reliable sources from the Silk Control Committee, the Ministry of Industry has decided on a plan to develop sales of Chinese silk to the United States. It will establish a joint public-private association to promote Chinese silk sales to the United States, and actively implement the plan to rescue the silk industry and restore sales in the American market.</p>
<p>Last week, raw silk exports further decreased. Our country's exports of yellow and white raw silk further declined. Last week, only 669 bales were shipped to Europe and the United States, a decrease of 131 bales compared to the previous week.</p>
<p>The sales of rayon are unlikely to improve due to unstable foreign exchange rates. It is unlikely that sales of rayon to foreign buyers will improve. Yesterday, only 19 cases of "Double Star," "Triple Star," and "Flying Elephant" brand futures were purchased by silk weaving factories in this port. The prices ranged from 174.25 yuan to 170 yuan net, slightly lower than before.</p>
<p>The sales of plain white silk fabrics are also weakening. Although the labor strike in the New York dyeing and weaving factories is currently under mediation and resumption of work is expected, the silk factory workers are still insisting on their demands. There is now a backlog of silk, and consumption is still decreasing. Silk prices continue to weaken, and actual sales in Lyon remain sluggish. Silk factories are purchasing only as needed, and Japanese silk is being dumped aggressively. No one is asking about Chinese silk. Although inland silk merchants have some interest in plain white silk fabrics, they are relentlessly suppressing prices. Factories are selling off stock at a loss, with each bale losing around 200 yuan. Yesterday, 35 bales of plain white silk fabrics were purchased from silk factories in Hangzhou and Huzhou, and 10 bales of plain dried white silk fabrics were purchased from Zhonghe. Prices are trending downward.</p>
<h3>Smooth Sales of Pingshui Pearl Tea to Europe</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the tea market of this port, Pingshui pearl tea from local merchants destined for Europe saw slightly smoother sales. A total of 270 boxes were purchased by Jardine Matheson and Tung Foo and other firms. High-grade tea sold for 90 to 96 yuan, while lower-grade tea sold for 77 yuan, a decrease of 10 yuan compared to previous prices. There were also sporadic negotiations for needle-shaped and precious eyebrow green teas from European and French firms, but no deals were made. Qimen black tea remained unsold.</p>
<h3>Metals: Extremely Scarce Imports of English Tinplate</h3>
<p>Although the trade in English tinplate has not been brisk recently, the stock in the market is very scarce. Therefore, the standard prices have been maintained and have not fallen. For example, 90-pound boxes are estimated at 15.8 yuan, 100-pound boxes at 17 yuan, double-sheet 90-pound boxes (i.e., 180 pounds) are estimated at 32 yuan, and 100-pound boxes (i.e., 200 pounds) are estimated at 34 yuan. However, recently, American goods have flooded the market, which has greatly impacted sales. However, overseas prices are very firm, with 90-pound boxes selling for 16 shillings, 100-pound boxes for 17 shillings and 8 pence, double-sheet 90-pound boxes for 32 shillings, and 100-pound boxes for 35 shillings and 6 pence. Moreover, the shilling exchange rate in this port is very high. Because there is no profit to be made, traders are not daring to purchase. Therefore, the arrival of English tinplate is particularly scarce, and there is a concern that the market may run out of stock in the future.</p>

<h3>The Study of "Eating"</h3>
<p>— Li Zhai</p>
<p>Almost all nationalities in the world have their own unique strengths. For example, the Germans excel in science and medicine; the Jews excel in accumulating wealth; the Japanese excel in rapidly imitating all advanced material civilizations; and the Americans excel in "innovating new styles." If someone were to ask: What is the unique strength of the Chinese nation? I would sit up straight and answer decisively: The most outstanding strength of the Chinese people in the world is "eating"! Populists or those who believe in "China First" will surely consider my statement as "self-abandonment"... "People must insult themselves before others insult them"! However, I have my own well-founded reply; please look at the facts!</p>
<p>"Eating" can be divided into two categories: one is direct and concrete "eating," and the other is indirect and abstract "eating." Our esteemed compatriots truly excel at both types of "eating," deserving to be called "masters of both"!</p>
<p>First, let's talk about concrete "eating." The Chinese will gather around a table with many "honored guests," slice open the skull of a live monkey, and everyone will scoop and eat the raw monkey brains. They will eat "Dragon Tiger Fight" and "Dragon Phoenix Grand Meeting," and they will eat shark fin soup that costs eighty yuan a bowl. If you and I could take a "vacation" from our family's "clothing, food, and housing" for three or four months, and book a table for three or five hundred yuan at a restaurant like Guanshengyuan or Xinya, at least half of the exotic dishes presented by those "Lingnan master chefs" would have names and contents that we wouldn't understand. All of these things considered, no matter how exquisite the Western cuisine at the Cathay Hotel is, selling for thirty or fifty yuan a dish, compared to the Chinese's "imaginative" "eating," Westerners are simply astonished and cannot even see our backs. However, these "eating" methods must be based on the premise of the "exploiting class." In another world at the "North and South Poles," there are also two-legged creatures like us who are eating corn buns, cornmeal, grass roots, tree bark, and Guanyin clay!</p>
<p>When it comes to abstract "eating," our "reference materials" are endless! In our "national opera," there are often lines like "eating the king's bounty, repaying the emperor's grace," and in history, there are often "great good old men" who "eat two thousand bushels of grain" or are "bestowed ten thousand households." From this, it can be seen that the ministers and generals of past dynasties all took abstract and indirect "eating" as their way of life.</p>
<p>In the past, scholars often called themselves or were described as "eating stipends." When they passed the imperial examinations, they became scholars, and were listed in the "top three," which was a consistent "eating" method for Chinese intellectuals who were divorced from the means of production: eating the Four Books and Five Classics, eating the eight-legged essay. This is the "eating" of the "Confucians."</p>
<p>Monks are famously "eating from all directions," but now there are many "highly knowledgeable" "senior monks" who have bank checks, villas, and mistresses, with round faces and bulging bellies. This is the "eating" of the "Buddhists": eating the Diamond Sutra, eating big and small dishes.</p>
<p>Zhang Tianshi carries the token and sword to the Great World to sell talismans, not hesitating to equate himself with "human meat," this is the "eating" of the "Taoists": eating spells.</p>
<p>"God" came to "visit the Celestial Empire" on the warships of the imperialists, so in addition to the Confucian, Buddhist, and Taoist realms, there was also a group of "eating the church." Since they "eat the church," wealth and beautiful women are all among them.</p>
<p>From the late Qing Dynasty to the present, many "great philanthropists" who managed dike construction and disaster relief funds have become wealthy and noble. This fact illustrates that some groups of "philanthropists" are "eating disasters," eating the lives and flesh of disaster victims.</p>
<p>According to reliable calculations, the total amount of donations to support the volunteer army against Japan was over 20 million yuan, but Ma Zhanshan and others received only 2 million yuan, with nine-tenths being swallowed up by "patriotic people." It can be seen that the way of life of these "patriots" is "eating the national crisis," which is eating the lives and blood of tens of millions of compatriots in Northeast China!</p>
<p>From "overthrowing the Manchus" to "anti-imperialist revolution," on the one hand, many revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their blood, and on the other hand, many "leaders" put villas, savings, and beautiful wives into their hands. After the "death" of a veteran who enjoyed a "national funeral" (actually a "provincial funeral"), a certain Zhou weekly magazine at Wanjing University wrote a eulogy: "Following the Premier for decades, lowering the flag for three days; accumulating family wealth of two million, with six concubines!" It can be seen how strong the "old revolutionary's" stomach was! This group of people can only be given the posthumous title: "eating the revolution" or "eating the blood of comrades"!</p>
<p>Others, such as good merchants, rely on "eating enemy goods" as a source of life. Also, some "editors," in the era of warlords, relied on writing parallel prose praising concubines to "eat" Zhang Zongchang, etc. When Zhang Zongchang went to Beppu, they also followed to Beppu. If Zhang Zongchang ate black dates, the Hanlin scholars could not follow him to the netherworld, but they would run to Shanghai to write a "preface" for someone's wife. It can be seen that the "eating" method of the "sacred door" is determined "according to the changes of the times."</p>
<p>There are too many "philosophers and patriots" who engage in the above "eating" methods, and the result is that China has become a mess. However, this phenomenon will certainly not be permanent. Once the lower classes, who eat corn buns, rough grains, grass roots, and tree bark, unite and engage in a historical general reckoning, then all those who engage in abstract "eating" may have a day when they "cannot eat it all and have to take it away"!</p>
<h3>In the Broadcasting Studio</h3>
<p>— Xiao Songjiang</p>
<p>It is said that friends who make a living by talking have been lucky this year, because the radio business has developed at a high speed within a year. If you have time to go to the balcony and look around, there are countless bamboo poles in the sky. At the same time, in every household, a group of people are eagerly trying out this new-fangled thing; however, radio has no rules. After playing for a while, there is always something going wrong. Nowadays, when everyone has free time, they listen to the radio.</p>
<p>No matter how you install the radio, you must have a square speaker to enjoy it. It is not a problem to get used to it. Although the broadcasting is only for one person, it is not a problem if everyone listens together. The requirements are just a few records and various musical scores.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>Actually, things seem easy, but once you start, you feel that every task requires experience. After spending months in the broadcasting studio without seeing the sun, I am writing a little to air out.</p>
<p>The most important responsibilities in the broadcasting studio are playing records and making announcements. Playing records is the easiest thing; the record player is electric, so you don't have to exert yourself to crank it. However, announcements are more troublesome. First, your voice must be steady, even, and clear. You have to keep your throat always at an even level, otherwise, it will affect the radio reception. For advertisements, naturally, someone will provide a script, but you must think of catchy phrases to make the listeners not feel annoyed every day. If you always introduce "This station is presenting," after reporting like this several times a day, you yourself would probably feel embarrassed.</p>
<p>Speaking of several red radio stations, they broadcast from nine or ten in the morning until one or two midnight every day, with no free time in the dozen or so programs. Listening to Suzhou storytelling and Shanghai灘 music is really tiring. You want to leave the broadcasting studio for a moment, but time is always controlling you, making your body feel like it is tied to a machine and you cannot be lazy.</p>
<p>Moreover, many guests visit the broadcasting studio (my words do not contain any hint of rejecting visitors). When broadcasting programs, you cannot greet them loudly, often offending them. I myself have been seen as an arrogant person, probably because I don't often entertain guests.</p>
<p>There is also a kind of suffering that listeners who close their eyes and relax on the sofa while listening to the radio can never imagine. It is already late autumn, and it is certainly comfortable to be warm in the broadcasting studio. However, when you go home after the program is over, you realize how bone-chilling the autumn night is. The most laughable thing is that on hot summer days, the windows of ordinary broadcasting studios are always closed to avoid external noise, even though they are there. Imagine a small broadcasting studio with velvet cloth around it, in the sweltering summer weather with no ventilation, the person shouting and singing is really like sitting next to a stove.</p>
<p>There are many interesting anecdotes and scandalous stories in the broadcasting studio. I would like to write them down when I have time for the readers of this publication to have a laugh.</p>
<p>Now the broadcasting time has arrived, please meet again next time in this publication.</p>
<h3>Two Overseas Students</h3>
<p>— Shi Ben</p>
<p>I didn't expect that in this suffocating and naive society of the eighteenth century, there would actually be two overseas students! This is such an honor! Not only their parents, clans, and relatives feel infinitely glorious, but also we townspeople, who share the same hometown, feel proud.</p>
<p>One of the two overseas students, surnamed Hu, came from an aristocratic family with both wealth and power. Spending eighteen thousand yuan to study abroad was not surprising. However, there was also one surnamed Zhu, whose family was ordinary, and his father was a hardworking farmer. He was not qualified to study abroad at all. Fortunately, Mr. Hu's father saw that he was intelligent and could be developed, so he subsidized him to accompany his son abroad, so that his son would not be lonely abroad. Therefore, this small town was able to produce two American students, one rich and one poor.</p>
<p>This spring, the two overseas students graduated from XX University in the United States and returned home after completing their studies.</p>
<p>When they returned home, it was like officials returning home in silk robes. Their parents were overjoyed, as if they had won 500,000 yuan in the lottery. Relatives and friends hosted banquets to welcome them, and the townspeople were stirred up by the title of "overseas student." Everyone ran to peek and catch a glimpse of their style, and kept saying, "Their parents are so glorious! Their sons have returned from studying abroad and can immediately become high officials. But, it's good for everyone when the neighbors become officials! Haha!" Because this semi-civilized town had never produced overseas students, and the townspeople's minds were often imprinted with the idea that returning from studying abroad was like passing the imperial examination in the Qing Dynasty, and they could immediately become high officials, they now worshiped and admired these two overseas students! It can be seen how glorious overseas students are in the countryside!</p>
<p>Before they had been back for a month, the townspeople were already spreading rumors: "Zhu XX has been invited by Jiang XX to be the XX Chief, and the National Government has sent a telegram to Hu XX, asking him to be the XX Minister." These ignorant townspeople all believed that overseas students were qualified to be XX Chiefs and XX officials, so such rumors arose unexpectedly!</p>
<p>However, the two of them were busy looking for a way out every day, asking friends and classmates for help. They were busy for three whole months without any hope. The townspeople couldn't believe that the overseas students had nothing to do.</p>
<p>The one surnamed Hu, because he was rich, had greater desires for seeking a job than the one surnamed Zhu. For example, when a relative introduced him to a position as a clerk in a foreign firm, he said, "Who wants to do this kind of slave job?" Another friend introduced him to a clerk position in the XX Municipal Government, and he also said, "Who wants to take on this kind of minor official position?". Unlike the one surnamed Zhu, he came from a poor background and had no good relatives or friends, so he could not get the clerk position that the one surnamed Hu did not want to do. After returning home for half a year, he was still unemployed. Once, there was an opportunity to be a primary school teacher, but he was afraid of losing the status of an overseas student because of the rumors spread by the townspeople, so he declined. Later, because of the pressure of life, out of frustration, he secretly went to Shanghai to work as a clerk under a foreigner, which was considered a solution to his overseas student's way out. When the one surnamed Hu heard about this, he was furious, thinking that this was insulting the personality of their overseas students and degrading the status of their overseas students. So, he chased after Zhu to Shanghai and rebuked him: "You useless thing, you don't care about the personality of us overseas students and come to do this shameful job of a clerk, willingly being a slave to foreigners. Think about it, I, who am much more noble than you, also refused to do the clerk position in a foreign firm because it was a slave job, and I also firmly declined the municipal government clerk position because I was afraid of losing the status of an overseas student... Now you are shamelessly doing this despicable job of a clerk, truly losing your personality and bankrupting your reputation, you are a disgrace to us overseas students..." Zhu was stunned by what he heard, unable to cry. Ashamed and resentful, he said in a trembling voice: "If I were as rich as you, and had no worries about life, I would also care about reputation and personality, but..." He was extremely sad and had no courage to continue speaking, so he could only cry. But, who will forgive his sorrow?</p>
<h3>"Selling Oneself for Patronage"</h3>
<p>— Li Yue</p>
<p>"Selling oneself" in the past feudal society was sometimes a thing that deserved people's sympathy and praise for a time. For example, selling oneself to bury one's father, mother, parents-in-law, or husband was said to be something that only filial sons and virtuous women with a spirit of self-sacrifice could do. This commendable thing was not only worthy of people's temporary sympathy and praise, but it was also something that would be remembered for generations to come, and would serve as an example for future generations. This means that "selling oneself" is not something that just anyone can do casually.</p>
<p>Things have changed in our current turbulent and chaotic society: Besides the filial sons and virtuous women who are determined to sacrifice themselves and can naturally do this "selling oneself" thing, other people of all kinds are equally courageous and determined to do this thing that ordinary people could not do before. Because this thing has a related relationship with "patronage" now, so many more people have already regarded this costless thing as the only "occupation" for making a living for life.</p>
<p>However, the "selling oneself for patronage" mentioned here can get a comfortable and enjoyable life without spending any money, and is clearly different from the business of prostitutes selling their smiles and screaming miserably in the cold wind on the streets during nights with rain and snow. Because when being a prostitute, although it is said that no capital is needed, you still have to take the money earned by letting people trample on your beauty and body to perm your hair, sell rouge and powder, cut fashionable clothes, wear flesh-colored silk stockings and high-heeled leather shoes, and also pay taxes and the rent for the second landlord, etc.: But the "selling oneself for patronage" mentioned here only needs to throw away all of your personality and soul completely, and single-mindedly follow the "master" like a "pug dog," running in and out and shouting left and right, and other than that, nothing else needs to be paid even slightly. Not only is beauty not needed, but the more ugly and fierce you are, the more you will get the "master's" favor and love, and there is a full hope that you will be promoted and become prominent and important, and you can "rely" on it.</p>
<p>However, "selling oneself" has the division of "whole sale" and "retail," so what you "rely" on is also proportionately different with "permanent" and "temporary." The permanent "rely" obtained by the so-called "whole sale" is that after swearing to follow the "master," you will always absolutely listen to the "master's" call, always absolutely take the "master's" will as your will, and absolutely cannot go to serve others, and no matter whether the "master" you "rely" on is a "Mount Tai" or an "iceberg," you must express loyalty and obedience, so that the "master" will allow it to "share blessings together." And the temporary "rely" obtained by "retail" is much more straightforward and free than "whole sale," but within the "sale" period, loyalty and obedience like a "pug dog" are undoubtedly still necessary conditions. For example, if the "master" gives it thirty yuan a day in "compensation," and tells it to harm the "master's" dissenting actions, then its task is only to be sure to promptly obey the order to complete it within the "sale" period, and the means of doing it can be up to it, and other than that, it can "damn everything else." But there is one thing that both "whole sale" and "retail" have in common, which is that in addition to "sharing blessings together" or "compensation," if you are unlucky enough to have to go to the execution ground to "be beheaded," then the "master" has no obligation to come forward to speak for you and ask for pardon, and the "sold out" "pug dog" should have no qualms, and absolutely go there with a happy and joyful expression. This means that those who throw away their personality, integrity, and soul to "sell themselves for patronage" and become "pug dogs" have no guarantee at all, although they can get a comfortable and enjoyable life without spending any money.</p>
<p>Opening your eyes and taking a look, a large group of promising young people are generally serving as "pug dogs" that are loyal and obedient to the "master"! I think: In our current turbulent and chaotic society, has being a "pug dog" become the only "way out" for making a living?…</p>
<h3>"Not Afraid Even If I Die"</h3>
<p>— Where to Go</p>
<p>People, you know; are originally this kind of clever thing, he knows what can be said can all be thought of, but what is thought of has some that cannot be said.</p>
<p>There are things that are said as soon as they are thought of. To say it politely, of course, it is candid; to say it impolitely, it is simply foolish. Because being a person requires being all things to all men, and speaking requires never revealing one's true intentions. For if not, people will see through this "mechanism in the sleeve," and once it is revealed, people will use this as a handle to attack you.</p>
<p>For example, talking about wanting a woman. If people ask if I want one, I will bite back and say no. By saying this, people will at least not be able to guess my true heart. Even if they want to laugh at me, they will not be able to laugh heartily. Furthermore, if I really want a woman, people will at least not be so wary of me, and I, in turn, can honestly guard against them. If things succeed, people can only stare in a daze; if not, I will also remain "unknown to gods or ghosts," and I only need to swallow the saliva in my throat quietly.</p>
<p>Talking about wanting to be an official is the same. Not telling the truth is always the best policy. When people ask, "Hey, there is a vacancy there, are you going to try for it?" When you hear this, it is best to put on a stern face and scold him "to the point of bloodshed, thoroughly and happily." Because putting on a stern face always makes people feel that it is genuine, let alone scolding with a stern face? In this way, you can both scold people and raise your own status. What is even cheaper is that you can make people go ahead with the matter without any suspicion. If it succeeds, "I will be my own high official, let them laugh and scold as they will," if not, it is worthwhile to scold people, vent your anger, and also grab a high-minded title.</p>
<p>Besides these, "understanding one thing leads to understanding all," naturally everything is the same. However, there are still some subtle minor problems in between. Of course, the more serious you are, the more people will trust you. However, if your "Kung Fu" is too shallow, you will inevitably reveal your true colors often. "The more you try to cover up, the more you reveal" is this kind of saying. Therefore, the general "old hands" are "experienced and profound" and "not flustered when facing the enemy." The more you "cut to the chase" and expose him nakedly, the more I will "insist on denying it" and "not change my original intention." It doesn't matter if my face turns red. The attitude must be firm, holding to the principle of "not being afraid even if I die." That is, even if people jump up and scold me, cry out that I am shameless, thick-skinned, and a hypocrite, I will still remain calm. In this way, "using softness to overcome hardness," the result is that people still have no way to deal with me.</p>
<h3>Europeanization</h3>
<p>— Guang Han</p>
<p>The minimum requirement is wearing a Western suit, and of course, shoes and hats must be uniform.</p>
<p>As for housing? A Western-style house is most suitable; otherwise, one should have a flush toilet and a Western-style washbasin and bathroom. At the very least, a sofa is indispensable.</p>
<p>Meals must be "grand": they cannot all be "grand," but if you have to eat "national dishes," it's okay. You can use knives and forks instead of chopsticks, which is not a departure from the principle of "Chinese essence, Western application." For snacks, it has to be bread and butter. To drink, either coffee or cocoa, as you please. Avoid using loose sugar; only use Taikoo sugar.</p>
<p>Walking: Shrug your shoulders, straighten your back, walk quickly, and dash around as if in an empty place. It would be even better to carry a "walking stick."</p>
<p>When walking with a woman, hold hands, and putting your arm around her waist is also acceptable.</p>
<p>Don't take cars too often; if not, then take first-class on the tram. Occasionally taking a rickshaw is also decent.</p>
<p>When you meet a friend, everyone should shake hands. (Nodding is still acceptable, but bowing is out of the question!)</p>
<p>Speaking is crucial. Being able to speak entirely in English or French, and hum a few Western songs, is top-notch. Next best is to insert a few Western words. Although there's no fixed rule for the amount, a ratio of ten to three is probably the most appropriate. If that's still too much, greet people with "Hello," say goodbye with "Au Revoir," call a gentleman "Mister," say "Sorry" for apologies, and you shouldn't have any trouble saying "Yes" and "No." This is the bare minimum. If you can't even do this, then you're not qualified to talk about Europeanization!</p>
<p>Envelopes should be Western-style. If you can't write foreign words,</p>
<p>you should still write the person's name and address horizontally, and the order must be reversed. The writing of names should be with the given name first and the family name last. Addresses, such as No. XX, XX Lane, XX Road, Shanghai, should be arranged as No. XX, XX Lane, XX Road, Shanghai. And don't forget to put the stamp in the upper right corner.</p>
<p>Printing your full name and address in one or two lines of foreign words on the back of your business card is indeed also very appropriate. It's both Europeanized and beautiful. It's also very convenient when interacting with foreigners.</p>
<p>Watching movies and dancing are "daily routines." Even those who are "nationalized" enjoy them, let alone those who are Europeanized?</p>
<p>Decorating your bookshelf with a few original Western books is also indispensable, regardless of whether you can understand them or not. It's best to carry a foreign newspaper when going out. Whether you can read it or not is not the issue, or perhaps you don't even intend to read it; just don't find it cumbersome. (As for knowing some current affairs, naturally, you are not forbidden from reading "national newspapers.")</p>
<p>Some people say that smoking is a bad habit, and "Lockhart" also tells us that nicotine contains toxic substances. But the gentlemen of the Analects Society quite encourage people to smoke, presumably because smoking won't cause much harm to one's character or endanger one's life. So, you might as well give it a try, because most foreigners like it. It's best to smoke cigars or hold a pipe, which is more generous.</p>
<p>If you can do these things, you can be considered fully Europeanized and have no regrets! If you're still not satisfied, then changing your hair is easy; with the help of chemicals, you can change its color. If you want blue eyes, a high nose, and white skin, then you'll have to consult doctors at beauty salons. If there's no way to do it, then it's beyond human power, not unwillingness; it should be understandable. Even genuine "foreign goods" wouldn't laugh at you for "drawing a tiger and failing to resemble it," right?</p>

<h3>Shanghai (3)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Lao San</p>
<p>(5) Dream</p>
<p>After being busy all day yesterday and not sleeping well at night, I sat on the sofa and felt a slight drowsiness. In a daze, it seemed like my younger brother and I were lying on the grass in front of our parents' graves. A gust of wind blew, and the graves burst open. Dad's eternally solemn face appeared before me from the grave. I let go of my younger brother's hand and wanted to run forward.</p>
<p>"Child, why did you leave your younger brother?"</p>
<p>A solemn voice.</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"You've arrived in Shanghai?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"To find the light I need?"</p>
<p>"You are surrounded by women!"</p>
<p>"I want revenge!"</p>
<p>"Good! Child, I am watching you at all times!"</p>
<p>The solemn face turned into a beautiful smile, and the grave disappeared without me knowing when. My younger brother was also gone. Everything was dark, only that beautiful smile, which暈 (I cannot translate this word with 100% accuracy, it seems to mean either blurred into an unbearable light or spread out) into a stinging radiance. It gradually approached me, finally making me unable to open my eyes.</p>
<p>"Dad, this is not the light I need."</p>
<p>I wanted to chase after my dad in the darkness but tripped over something.</p>
<p>"Brother, did you have a nightmare?"</p>
<p>Such a small voice came from the darkness.</p>
<p>(6) I am Sister Min</p>
<p>Opening my eyes, I was lying next to the sofa. The one speaking was the soulless woman I wanted to take revenge on. She was always smiling. I stood up and naturally put on Dad's solemn face.</p>
<p>"Why did you come into my room?"</p>
<p>A solemn voice.</p>
<p>"It's not a dream now!"</p>
<p>A playful tone.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Can't I come in?"</p>
<p>I didn't have Dad's experience and didn't know if it was okay to smile now, so I involuntarily revealed a trace of a smile. She was my enemy. I couldn't be surrounded by women. I wanted revenge. But that petite bourgeois woman was like a mischievous child. I wasn't afraid of the enemy's ferocity, I was afraid of the enemy's rubbery nature. When I lost the ability to deal with the enemy, I heard, "I am watching you at all times!" followed immediately by the second warning, "Don't let her go!" I suddenly grew courageous and restrained my smile.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>A solemn voice.</p>
<p>"Can you listen to my report?"</p>
<p>A playful tone.</p>
<p>"I am your mother's adopted daughter, I am Sister Min! Not the Sister Min you lost. We look very similar. For this reason, after your mother lost her beloved daughter, she adopted me. Sister Min was also the name your mother gave me, it was to commemorate her beloved daughter. At that time, I lived at the county high school, and we didn't have many opportunities to meet. A year later, my adopted mother passed away, and your father remarried, so I never went to your house again, because our relationship had been lost with the death of my adopted mother. I am an orphan living under my uncle's roof. After I stayed with your mother, she treated me like her own daughter, so I often went to her grave to cry bitterly. At the grave, every time I saw you leading your younger brother's hand coming from across the small bridge, I didn't want us to meet in such a setting: given our circumstances, it might evoke even greater grief."</p>
<p>That petite bourgeois woman was no longer a smiling, mischievous child, she was as solemn as a judge in a courtroom. She continued:</p>
<p>"Every time you came from across the small bridge, I would first escape from behind and hide among the desolate graves, secretly watching your actions. You always lay on the grass without saying a word, every day like that. Yesterday was of course the same, but, to some extent, I understood your unusual behavior. In yourself, perhaps you thought you were trying your best to stay calm. 'Go,' it was as if someone was urging me. I thought of this word. The night express train was the solution to our fate, younger brother, do you understand? That's how I came to Shanghai and ran into your room."</p>
<p>With a wry smile, the enemy I wanted to take revenge on was now a companion on the same journey.</p>
