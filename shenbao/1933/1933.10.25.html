<p>時評</p>
<h3>世界兩個不平</h3>
<p>— 元</p>
<p>今日世界危險之局勢。一言蔽之。不外兩種不平之現象所造成。在國内由於人民所享受物質苦樂之不平。在國際由於列國所得權利利益之不平。</p>
<p>因爲國内人民貧富懸殊過甚。於是發生經濟上之恐慌。引起地方上之不安。此種現象。尤以美國爲最顯。美政府爲此苦心經營。以圖經濟之復興者巳久。然迄無切實把握。今其總統羅斯福。雖已决定放棄通貨膨脹政策。先提高物價而後安定金元。其政策未嘗不是。但有無效果。殊非今日所能懸斷。吾人以爲羅斯福最近已有最切實而扼要之一語。如果總實行此一語。則較任何政策爲有效。其言錄如下。</p>
<p>路透社二十二日華盛頓電。羅斯福今日取得華盛頓學院之名譽學位後致詞。謂現有數國。其狄克推多已製定其所謂五年或十年計畫者。但美國未有狄克推多。余以爲吾人更可推進以赴吾人目的。無須限定若干時期。又謂以少數人之財富。善遍分配於人民。殆可致國家於安全。以少數人財富者普遍分配於人民一語。驟視之幾疑羅斯福亦欲實行蘇聯之共産政策矣。然其實欲生存於今日之世界。無論其國爲何種制度。皆不能違反此定義。我國古人所謂不患寡而患不均。用意亦不外是。蓋今日世界各國國内之所以紛擾不安者。無一不由於貧富不均而起。貧富不均而起。貧富愈懸殊。其國必愈危險。吾人固不必舉例以證而即可明瞭者也。以故羅斯福之言。值得吾人重視者。欲謀根本救國。舍此無他策。</p>
<p>因爲國際間所享受權利利益之不平等。於是發生國際間之競爭。引起擴張軍備之風雲。全世界遂陷於不安之奬態。今日德國因爭平等之故。而致脱退國聯與軍縮世界和平破裂。幾有朝不待夕之勢。但觀德希特勒重返國聯之演說。亦未嘗無挽救和平之意。不過須承認其平等地位耳。其演詞略如下。　　路透社二十三日凱爾漢姆電。希特勒在自由戰爭紀念碑前演說。謂德國人民並不祈求戰爭。德國人民正因酷愛和平。故願爲和平之生存而奮鬥。吾人惟一目的。爲求空居樂業。有工作。有源吃。他國亦不應横加干涉。吾人可明告世界。倘汝等願吾人加入各項國際會議與聯盟者。吾人無不惟命是從。但汝等必須先承認吾國之國格。</p>
<p>希特勒之言。甚爲質直。其所謂國格云者。即平等而已。世界無侵略野心之國。各自安其居。樂其業。工作其所工作。吃其所應吃之飯。則世界未有不和平者。惟自國際間有權利利益之衝突。野心者爲此權利利益之衝突而相競。國際間乃有爭奪。乃有不平等之地位。因國際間之不平等。乃有和平破裂之危險。乃有爭和平而發生不和平之事實。此中樞機。皆在於野心國家一念之差。苟世界野心國家。能覺悟侵略人國之終不利於已。並不利於世界。而幡然改圖以平等之精神待人。則國際自無不和平之慮而世界安矣。吾故發此言爲一般有野心者告。</p>
<h3>廣田着手刷新外交荒木力謀擴充軍備　駐歐美各使全部更調　軍費要求六萬萬日金　杉村有任駐華公使說</h3>
<p>（東京）　陸軍省因種種原因、明年之軍事預算將龐大無比、據聞其數目爲日金六○○·○○○·○○○元、其中二五○·○○○·○○○元、爲補充軍械及改編軍隊之用、其所以要求如許軍費預算之理由、可列爲下述數點、（一）因去年與「滿洲國」簽定公約後、日軍所負之責任重大、（二）蘇俄軍備之現代化及效能之增加、實予日本以重大威脅、（三）日軍退出國聯後、其責任亦增重、（四）日軍之武器遠不及其他强國、當歐戰時、日本在事實上未參加大規模之戰事、故弱點較多、而戰後武監之補充、復被限制、於提　多時之軍器補充計畫、今年始克當行、但須至明後年始能竣事、　尚須欵項數用、始能如期完成、</p>
<p>去冬十二月、日陸軍省曾發表聲明、謂軍費必須增加、因日本須增加駐滿軍隊、整理日本整個陸軍、增加軍隊之機械及行動力、及改革現行之兵役、與訓練制度也云云、其後陸相荒木、又於國會中答覆議員質問時、表示原來計劃需日金五三○·○○○·○○○元、但爲符合政府之意旨起見、巳將其數目减爲四一○·○○○·○○○元、分一九三四年度及一九三五年度之預算中撥付、實際目前之預算中、僅付日金一二○·○○○·○○○元而已、</p>
<p>現該計劃業已開始實行、軍部之聲明、僅將計劃之大意說明、而補充及改良之詳細辦法則未言明、惟據軍部方面人員之私人談話、及本地報紙所登載之消息、其改革之詳則大致如下、</p>
<p>（一）步兵仍爲十七師團、僅内部小有變動、（二）現行之派兵駐滿辦法、仍繼續進行、（三）另組獨立守備隊兩大隊、長期駐滿、每隊轄兵六營負護路勦匪之責任、其組織與現行之守備隊相同、其主要目的爲國内防禦、（四）關東軍之兵力、將由一萬○五百人、增至六萬五千人、由國内軍隊三師又四分之一及騎兵兩獨立旅組成之、同時各師團兵士之人數亦均增加、（五）目前之空軍八聯隊、均將重行改組、由二十六隊增至三十五隊、（六）組坦克車兩聯隊、一駐久留米、一駐千葉、每團分三營、每營分三隊、每隊各有坦克車十二架至十五架、總計坦克車達二百六七十架、從前日本僅有坦克車一隊、其所需之坦克車、皆由日本自製、現巳完成、其員兵由步兵中選撥、其兵役年限爲二年、（七）設立化學戰事學校、從事研究預防壽氣之方法及施用毒氣之方法云、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<h3>日本刷新外交　從更調駐外各使着手</h3>
<p>（東京）　廣田外相於上次之五相會議確立外交國策之根本方針、所謂實行廣田外交巳至着手之時期、故於刷新外交方針、同時實行更迭駐外使節、决一新人心、對於長岡駐法大使之呈請辭職、擬以佐藤駐比大使繼之、并擬起用有田外交次官爲駐比大使、又年終返國之出淵駐美大使、若呈請辭職、擬選永井駐德大使或吉田駐意大使繼任、又目下在北平與黄郛舉行重要會談中之有吉駐華公使、若於十二月返國、擬乘此機會、起用杉村陽太郎爲駐華公使、故外務省之刷新人事將於一二月内實現、因此省内頗呈生氣、（二十四日電通社電）</p>
<p>（東京）　歐洲國際政局之動向、以日内瓦爲中心、日本方面、不僅從對國聯之關係、從對國際政治之中心、有重視日内瓦之必要、廣田外相巳確立整備日本在日内瓦外交機關陣容之方針、惟因預算關係、不能講根本的處置、擬變更目下日本國聯事務局之官制、改稱爲國際會議事務局、局長仍由澤田節藏公使留任、次長則調現駐比大使館參事館横山正草爲日内瓦總領事、使之兼任、大約來春實現、（二十四日電通社電）</p>
<h3>出淵奉召回國</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）　日本駐美大使出淵、本日接外務省回國報告日美關係情形之命令、衆料出淵大使回國後、不再回任、其家族將於十一月上旬由舊金山乘船回日、據出淵談話、彼擬與家族同船回國、到日後或長住日本、亦未可知、（二十三日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）　出淵駐美大使、曾有歸國辭任之意、又以一九三五年之外交危機在即、對美外交之新方策、巳由五相會議决定、爲與外相接洽起見、擬歸國一行、昨電廣田外相請訓、外相已發許可之訓電、出淵大使之歸國期、俟觀李維諾夫渡美後之經過、再行决定、大體十一月下旬出發華府、惟出淵大使歸國後、將以讓賢爲理由呈請辭職、殆爲確定之事、其後任以駐德大使永井松三爲最適任、然自對美外交之重大性觀之、駐荷公使齋藤博亦極有望、其他方面、亦有松岡洋右繼任之說、廣田外相究任何人、足表示對美外交之動向、極堪注目、（二十四日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）　自日政府决定召回出淵駐美大使後、現正計畫大規模之更變各駐外大使、據確息、駐比大使佐藤、將調任駐法大使、以繼長岡、佐藤之遺缺、將由前日外務次官有田接充、至於出淵大使返日後、其繼任人選、以駐德之永井、及駐英之松方、爲最有望、二人中尤以永井呼聲最高云、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）　根據五相會議决定之外交根本方針、外務·陸軍·海軍當局聯絡恊議·正趕急起草外交國策案、廣田外相俟其完成、電告駐外使臣、徹底政府善處外交危機之意嚮、同時關於情勢報告及其他、使駐外使臣與本省之聯絡、比從來更加緊密、外相對於有吉公使俟其完畢在華北之要務後、將命其歸國、關於最近中國情勢、向公使直接聽取報告後、再面授對策方針、（二十四日電通電）</p>

<h3>秉政僅九閱月法左翼内閣顚覆　財政案受左右派夾攻　國會卒以多數票否决　總統召各派領袖解决政潮　急進黨將仍爲新内閣中心</h3>
<p>（巴黎）　法内閣因其預算提議今日清晨在國會衆院失敗、已全體辭職、（二十四日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　昨日上下午衆議院討論財政整理案、歷時甚久、政府所提之財政法案、卒以三百二十九票對二百四十一票之多數被否决、内閣業已辭職、按政府此次所提財政整理案、中有一條、現定公共機關及私人機關辦事人員之薪俸性質固定者、應抽税百分之六、社會黨反對此項條文、急進黨則希望採取折衷辦法、兩黨代表曾聯合開會、力求妥恊、社會黨黨内之少數派如勒盧台爾·馬爾蓋雖主張擁護現政府、然多數派則不贊成、且謂對於薪俸抽税一事、須先徵求各職業團體首領之意見、而各職業團體亦不以薪俸抽税爲然、因是衆議院對於此事、討論頗爲困難、衆院擁護政府之左派多數黨、係以急進黨及社會黨組合而成、今社會黨旣不能與政府同意、則内閣自不能不陷於顚覆之一途、、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　國會各議員對内閣之顚覆不以爲異、咸認此事爲社會黨内部意見紛歧自然結果、蓋社會黨對於參加政府一層、意見始終未能統一也、至於中央及右派各黨、雖主張節减政策、但以政府財政案過於沾染社會主義色彩、以故此次政府之顚覆、實係受左右若干派之夾攻、至於後任内閣之趨勢如何、目下言之、尚嫌太早、急進黨將聯合右派若干份子以組織多數黨乎、抑將結納社會黨少數派而加以中央派若干票、以組成多數黨乎、則非此時所能預料矣、衆院休息室中已有推測未來總理人選者、如海長薩勞·内長旭當·財長龐萊·及敎育長特蒙齊·皆認爲有組閣希望、但在大總統徵求各方意見以前、尚難斷定、總統由本日起、即已開始向各黨徵求意見、以便任命新總理組織新閣、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>按急進社會黨在本屆國會中、最初由赫里歐組閣、因償付美國戰債問題、與衆院不愜、退職下台、旋由外長彭古繼起組閣、約支持一月即被推翻、至達賴勞内閣自就職至今、爲時不過九閱月耳、</p>
<h3>達賴第提出財政案舌劍唇槍起激辯</h3>
<p>（巴黎）　此次内閣之失敗、係在多年未見最激烈辯論之後、當時會塲門首、軍隊環繞、以防納税人衝入示威、其形勢之嚴重、亦屬平時所罕見、</p>
<p>總理達賴第爭辯至最後時期、曾大聲宣稱、余輩兹向國會挑戰、請對於政府財政政策、予一完全與確定之判斷、倘諸君推倒此政府、休想新政府能有更佳之辦法、按現政府政策、堅决反對用膨脹通貨計劃、應付預算巨額虧短之難關、此項虧短、約近英金四千八百萬鎊、故於其發表之日、外間即料現政府之難於維持也、</p>
<p>顧此際雙方舌戰、俱巳入於筋疲力盡之時、達拉第於午夜後開始爲政府預算辯護、至此已唇焦舌敝、各議員亦神經緊張、不復能密切注意矣、</p>
<h3>國會四周武裝戒備預防納税人暴動</h3>
<p>斯時國會四周及附近街衢、則有大隊警察守衛、聖傑門大道、更駐有共和防衛兵二千五百餘名、阻止交通、到處鋼盔刺刀、異常森嚴、國會附近小巷更有特别預備隊暗中把守、以防憤怒之納税人衝入國會、聞一日一夜間所捕嫌疑犯在一百名以上、皆被疑爲領導納税人企圖作示威行動者也、</p>
<h3>新社會黨突然離異投票不信任政府</h3>
<p>當開議之初、達賴第平心靜氣、詳述政府彌補巨額虧短之計畫、其中一部份、擬痛减政費、大裁冗員、以資節流、迨總理演說畢、議員開始討論、初意新社會派將擁護政府、詎知結果僅得三十人左袒而巳、</p>
<p>旣而討論至三十七條、規定政府所隷文官减俸數額、由百分之三改爲百分之九、反對派遽行提出不信任政府案、迨表决時新社會派僅三十人信任政府、十人放棄投票權、其餘皆變爲不信任政府、表决結果、據非正式檢點、乃三百票反對政府原案、贊成者僅二百四十票、斯時全塲頓形混亂、其後又正式複檢一過、則爲三百二十九票反對政府、二百四十一票贊成政府、</p>
<h3>後任閣揆人選呼聲薩勞旭丹爲最高</h3>
<p>於是政府立即宣告辭職、閣員相率退席、嗣乃聲稱將於下午三時三十分晋謁總統、遞正</p>
<p>現據冬　　　　商情形、似將組織聯合内閣、面由原任殖民地總長民主黨左派之薩勞·或原任内長急進社會黨之旭丹·出爲總理云、、（二十四日國民電）</p>
<h3>總統急求解决政潮以泯除黨見勗勉</h3>
<p>（巴黎）　達拉第内閣旣倒、法國今日至困難之事務、爲獲一能挽救佛郎暴落之政府、全國現皆仰望於急進黨領袖旭丹史悌格與凱洛、蓋救國之最佳機會、厥在諸人泯除黨見、以保全佛郎之穩固也、達拉第内閣傾覆後、佛郎即爲價軟、今晨開盤價爲八三·二○合英重一鎊、昨價爲八二·一二、衆信法蘭西銀行現正作維持佛郎價之企圖、總統勒白倫今日侵晨接見辭職之閣員、旋於九日開始會商、最先晤總統與、爲參議院議長尼萊、據稱、今日至要之任務、爲保衛佛郎與法國土地云、繼衆院議長波益松與凱洛等相繼入見、昨日所拘示威者、今日均由警署開釋、用以堵塞道路之私人汽車、亦悉歸還原主、惟街車司機多人、現仍在覊押中、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<h3>對外政策蕭規曹隨達賴第將長外交</h3>
<p>（巴黎）　繼任爲總理者、大約以急進派薩勞與旭丹及參院財政委員會主席凱洛爲最有望、新政府之外交政策蕭規曹隨、無甚變動、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　現薩氏繼任總揆之呼聲甚高、聞將羅致泰狄歐派及社會黨組織集中内閣、外長一席將予達拉弟云、（二十四日國民電）</p>
<h3>閣潮引起金融危局佛郎勢將起變化</h3>
<p>（巴黎）　政府之失敗、將引起嚴重之危局、因佛郎將起變化、而德國之退出國聯、已發生國際吃緊局勢也、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<h3>大挫之先曾獲小捷通過二十一條文　證劵適用預先估計法</h3>
<p>（巴黎）　本日午後衆議院繼續討論財政案、以舉手法通過財政案之第二十一條、此條規定、對於國家證劵以外之一切證劵、適用預先估計方法、討論關於證明手續之第二十條時、甚易通過、迨至討論第二十一條時、即有多數修正案提出、右派指責預先估計方法、謂「有價證券旣付所得税及轉移税、現又加以預先估計、不啻課以三層之税、政府原意欲防止漏税者、然良善之納税者遂受其影響矣、」前財政部長德拉斯特里謂恐招致資本利息加高並增設新官吏之弊、但庇脱利則擁護預先估計方法、謂其爲預防方法而非警懲方法、右派首領之一即馬蘭、詢間儲蓄銀行所發之利息是否亦用預先估計法、總理達拉第作否定答復之後、二十一條始被通過、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英閣議主張軍縮展期延會　小國贊同美代表反對　主幹部會今日重開　英外次代西門出席</h3>
<p>（倫敦）　英内閣於今日下午舉行特别會議、討論達一點三刻鐘之久、會議討論德國退出國聯及軍縮後之國際形勢、及各國間關於此事交换意見之結果、據路透社記者探得之消息、内閣已决定西門外相暫時不返日内瓦、由外務次官艾登代往、艾登將於昨晨（星期二日）赴日内瓦出席星期三日舉行之軍縮會議主幹部會議、倫敦方面人士以爲國際間之形勢、殊難捉摸、故未能使英内閣得一肯定之决議、尤以法國國會之情勢及與德法意三國間之談判仍在進行中、尚難即决定應付之步驟云、衆信英内閣贊成軍縮會之短期延會、同時據日内瓦方面之消息、國聯方面人士亦贊成此意、蓋有同一之見解也、大約軍縮會之休會時間、將延至十一月十二日德國大選以後、其延會之時間、約有二三月、列强於休會時中、可與德進行單獨談判、俾使德國重行加入國聯及軍縮會、同時將選出一起草委員會、凖備根據各方之提案及修正案修改以前英國提出之軍縮計劃、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　昨日英國内閣會議、决定贊成軍縮會議主席團及總委員會延期開會後、瑞士·奥國·匈牙利·芬蘭諸國、對於英國此項决定、均表贊同、但美國則顯然表示反對、而尤以美國代表台維斯爲甚、台維斯於上午向軍縮會議主席漢特森交涉、告以彼之感想、台維斯似巳凖備一切、俾令軍縮會議繼續工作、會議無論用何種方式、總之必須繼續開會云、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>麥唐納演說願繼續爲軍縮努力　希望德國重返合作</h3>
<p>（倫敦）　英相麥唐納今日在克勞萊演說、謂英政府不欲放棄謀取一種議定的軍縮計劃之努力、英國對德國可無怍色、亦無歉詞、世界各國必須發展睦鄰精神、苟各國不能以平等地位列座一案、則歐洲决不能有何解决、德國必須使他國能處其旁而不生恐懼及猜忌之心、英國將採行其認爲可獲最好結果之計劃、當然不以自己逃脱爲其方法之一、渠不認德國之行爲、使世界他國獨自處理其困難者、乃可造成歐洲和平與信任之方法、渠希望德國一遇機會即利用之、以表示其追求和平並亟願與他國不欲使之犧牲其榮譽或自尊者重行合作之意云、（廿三日路透電）</p>
<h3>法國立塲聲明不變</h3>
<p>（巴黎）　外長彭古接見報界代表、發表談話云、此次閣潮、絕不至變更法國在軍縮會議之立塲、巴黎方面、認爲軍縮會議應進行工作、日内瓦方面或將决定軍縮延會、對於此層、法國雖不加以反對、但巴黎方面、期望延會應有限期、不應無期延緩、法國對於下列兩項辦法、均所贊成、一爲英國所提議、主張延緩開會、以俟十一月十二日德國公民投票之結果、一則依瑞士之提議、定十二月一日爲軍縮會議重開之日期、（二十四哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>日軍縮全權凖備束裝返國</h3>
<p>（東京）　德國退出國聯後、日軍部對於軍縮會議已無絲毫之期待、本定提出軍縮便議停開案、因恐世界誤會日本獨不願縮軍、軍部態度已改取消極、待他國提出休會案、日則倡贊成、聞軍部已命軍縮全權整裝返國、森田中將擬赴法任武官職、長谷川中將則直接回國、（廿四日華聯社電）</p>

<h3>奥國社黨活躍　卍字旗幟到處飛揚　天空散反政府傳單</h3>
<p>維也納　自德國退出國聯後、國社黨黨員益爲膽壯、而從事宣傳、雖當局嚴加懲治、不顧也、卍字旗近時時飛揚於公共建築、並於山側多處、紥成大卍字、潑油焚之、使數哩外可以瞭見、薩爾資堡日者天空有小汽球無數、汽球旣炸、即有反政府之傳單紛紛落下、而擁護政府者、亦作種種報復舉動、例如在斯蒂里亞之佛羅萊特强迫國社黨黨員繫繩於腰、而將其同黨嵌於山石間之卍字拉毁、又迫國社黨著名律師多人、將漆於火車站對面之大卍字洗去之類是也（二十三日路透電）</p>

<h3>日俄關係惡化　俄滿邊境均遣兵防守　戰事有一觸即發之勢　日滿兩航線定下月一日開始飛行</h3>
<p>（南京）　日俄間關係數星期來日見惡化、俄方曾遣重兵於俄滿邊境、戰事有一觸即發之勢、兹據東北方面消息、本月三日駐朝陽日軍第六師團一部約計一千三四百名、向東開拔、經過錦州之日軍運輸亦甚忙碌、聞皆係開往黑省邊境一帶防俄、再海參崴方面自建築軍港後、俄人爲防洩漏秘密計、特訂外輪入港須經俄輪引導、否則不准自由入港、日方曾提出抗議、要求對於日輪設一例外、俄方亦未允許、又息、日人爲發展日滿夜間航空、擬暫分兩線、一由東京飛大連、約二十小時、一由東京飛朝鮮約五小時、並預定於十一月一日開始飛行云（二十四中央社電）</p>

<h3>麥芽對西人今晚水球大戰　丨七時半在西青游泳池丨　楊秀瓊小姐出塲混合接力　楊氏兄弟將表演縛足游泳</h3>
<p>粤港選手組織之麥芽游泳隊、與上海西人隊、對抗兩晚、不幸以五分之差失敗、而第二晚决勝負之最後一塲水球戰、麥芽不能獲勝、而致失敗、尤屬可惜、而其比賽之緊張、得未曾見、失敗原因、在於水池之不熱、及選手之疲於其他比賽、故雙方爲作最後一次之决勝、特約定於今晚七時半起、在西青游泳池、再作一塲水球戰、雙方養精蓄銳、陣線皆焕然一新、列之如下、</p>
<p>▲麥芽隊　陳其松·黄紀良·郭振恒·王新民·楊亨華·陳福星·周　琴、</p>
<p>▲西人隊　台維斯·瓊斯敦·辛克萊·華史丹　麥列斯脱·辛克萊·白郎·法平·</p>

<p>▲縛足游泳　尚有一表演、爲楊氏兄弟亨華元華表演縛足游泳、路程五十碼、縛兩足以游泳、亦殊難得見、</p>

<h3>錦標打錦標二對一南華倖勝東華　李義臣連失兩只十二碼　論實力南華不比東華好</h3>
<p>上居香港足球錦標南華會與上屆上海足球錦標東華會、昨會師於中華棒球場、錦標打錦標、球迷無不以先睹爲快、故昨雖非休沐日、觀者仍有五六千人、上半時華南先得十二碼機會首開紀錄、繼之李義臣收復失地、成一對一秋色平分、下半時東華得二次十二碼機會、李義臣罰、兩度失機、而南華梁達榮奮勇爭先、又勝一球、結果南華以二比一戰勝東華、</p>
<h3>論球藝均覺欠缺</h3>
<p>兩隊同是冠軍誰强誰弱、尤爲球迷關切、預料必有一幕精彩表演、但昨出塲陣線均朱完善、故表演弛緩鬆懈、並不緊張東華陳家球有投奔優游之說、昨未出場、前線起用後進、不免减色、南華由包家平任中鋒、聯絡勝過東華、但射門無材過門不入、踢來殊少精彩、較之日前港滬之戰、相去甚遠、</p>
<p>上屆香港冠軍南華足球隊（本報徐天章攝）</p>
<h3>包家平首開紀錄</h3>
<p>交鋒之初、南華聲勢甚盛、東華門前屢現危機、屠博士奮勇當先、東西搶救、偶一不愼、被罰十二碼、由包家平主踢、一脚蹴去、正落陸大門手中、球迷歡聲雷動、大慶出險、殊料以號令未發、陳吉祥摇手重行主罰、於是老包得巧、由門角射去、陸鐘恩救之不及、東華遂首負一球、</p>
<h3>李義臣平分天下</h3>
<p>東華負球後、誓師反攻、征騎四出、南華陣囊、險象環生、幸李天生保駕得力、屢次化險爲夷、如今雙方陣勢、互相消長、至三十分鐘時、曹秋亭在右邊獲球、如快馬加鞭、衝破三關、傳於李義臣、義臣不慌不忙、一個鶴子翻身、右足憑空射去、球如飛矢、落入網窩、上半時結束、一與一秋色平分、</p>
<h3>十二碼兩次失機</h3>
<p>下半時上塲、東華求勝心切、士氣奮發、李天生以手觸球被罰十二碼、李義臣主踢、不高不低、打中黄紀良手中、南華出險、第二次劉茂推倒屠博士、被判十二碼、仍由李義臣主罰、義臣以首次無功、此次存心建樹、希圖從門角射去、殊料過於取巧、一脚踢出打中左柱、南華又獲出險、從此東華命運、益告險惡矣、</p>
<h3>梁達榮巧建奇功</h3>
<p>南華自兩次出險後、前鋒如生龍活虎、銳不可當、伍寳渠一馬當先、突破東華内衛線傳於楊水益、水益輕遠門前、梁達榮毫不客氣、反鈎入門、清晰美觀、陸大門徒呼奈何、東華又負一球、是後雖拚命反巧、奈以南華防守嚴密、李天生鋼關難破、銀笛一鳴、宣告結束、南華遂以二對一戰勝東華、裁判員陳吉祥、雙方陣線如下、</p>

<p>馬路邊旁的人行道上，有男的，女的，長的，短的，胖的，瘦的各色各樣的行人，正像狹長的淺水灘　擁擠着儘千儘萬尾的魚兒在爭相溯流而上，肩摩踵接，煞是難行，然而，善走路者，知道非「推」不可，於是臂膊做前鋒，把弱者推在一邊，自己搶上一步前這了。弱者們不怪自己走路的藝術不精，反一味詛咒馬路的狹窄和行人的衆多，實在錯誤已極，那得不落人後！</p>
<p>左爲峭壁，右爲懸崖，只在當中踐踏成了一條羊腸似的鳥道，我們置身其上，自然覺得十分險峻，而况，日薄西山，猛虎在後，乃强者爲要保全自己的生命，不惜把我們前行的同伴撞入萬仞的崖谷中，以便自己向前狂奔，其行爲隂險可知；其實，生路只有前面狹窄的一條，被推者不見機快跑，反礙他人的去路，顚崖壑谷，那是自己活該！</p>
<p>聰明的，知道與他人擠在一塊，前路的障碍必多；而羊腸鳥道，尤其不願冒險去走；於是轉灣抹角，尋出許多捷徑來。這捷徑，有的，是憑着或種手段利用倀鬼或强迫鄉愚引導的；有的，却是半空中的安琪兒指引他的。他們獲得了這樣的捷徑，到達他們的目的地之後，便在前面的平原曠野，或在羣峰頂上造起象牙之塔，水晶之宫；一面站在最高層對着帶跌帶撞的儕輩表示同情似的安慰着：路是要自己尋的，但不許奪，「抄襲」尤其不可，朋友！</p>
<p>傻子們旣不能推，又不能撞，經過聰明的成功者的啟示，乃豁然領會似的去另尋出路；但，錯認桃源，動便迷津；有時尋着一條幽徑僻巷，却又遇着「此路不通」的告白，於是懊喪，煩惱，悲哀，盲目地喊着「没有出路」。</p>
<p>是的，現成的路太少了；從只有荆棘的地方新開出來的路，也巳擠得水洩不通，現在只有鑿山穿洞，毁屋成路，朋友，努力吧！</p>
<h3>一致</h3>
<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>大砧墩聳聳得高高，砧墩旁站着一個非一尺二寸腰身的衣服不能上身的切醬肉司務，據說，這是姑蘇始創老陸稿荐不用實業部立案，商標局註册，而巳家喻户曉，童叟皆知的惟一商標。但是在蘇杭一帶，肥得象徵着猪的大塊頭切肉司務守着大砧墩的老陸稿荐，所在皆是，而更其是上海，平均每一條街上，至少有一家陸稿荐。儘着切肉司務說着純粹的山東話，或是一口浦東腔，可是金字招牌上，却非冠着「姑蘇始創」不可。於是乎即使有怕人冒牌，而特地掛起了烏龜招牌，以便「認明烏龜，庶不致悮」，竟也有人也玩一個「烏龜爲記」。誰是「始創」，誰是「冒牌」，只有天曉得。</p>
<p>香烟公司因營業清淡，於是挖空心思，想出了「空壳掉换奬券」的辦法。眞靈，馬上就有六七家烟公司，跟着也玩一套。自從取締香烟公司以現金贈奬，某烟公司改用金質的東西作爲贈奬之後，其餘六七家烟公司，也跟着用銀製品或禮券之類爲奬。猴子學人穿衣戴帽，看的人明知是那一套，但即使玩了一套又一套，看的人倒也不覺得怎麽煩膩。</p>
<p>外國人說中國商人不道德，最愛「冒牌」，「仿效」。不錯，中國商人的確是精於「冒牌」，「仿效」。但「冒牌」「仿效」，是否是不足提倡的，這還是一個疑問。因爲在我的眼光中看來，最低的限度，也可以表示出中國商人的「一致」精神來。若是這家陸稿荐用一個二百多磅的大胖子守大砧墩，别家却用一個九十磅重的癆病鬼，這家糖食店掛烏龜商標，别家用黑甲魚爲記，這便是不守秩序。若是這家烟公司現金贈奬，别家却不跟着玩，便顯得是步伐凌亂了。惟其如此，才「一致」得值得贊歎，所以只須有一家商店銷售仇貨，不用說得，别家是不會没有的。</p>

<h3>葫蘆</h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>說眞方，賣假藥，本是走江湖醫生的慣技。他在閙市裏，選定了一塊場地，用兩條板凳，幾塊木板，就可以搭成一個攤兒；也有僅在地上舖了一塊破布就算的。至攤上所羅列的東西，則有人齒，獸爪，乾　的鱷魚，猢猻的骨骼，大大小小的玻瓶，裏面浸着蜈蚣蛇蝎的毒物。這是人人都可以賞識的。還有幾個蘆葫，有的是磁製的，有的是眞葫蘆，漆得殷紅，塞兒都塞得緊騰騰地。至於裏面藏些什麽妙藥則祗有天曉得了。這些葫蘆，不管它們是眞的還是假的，它們總像煞有介事般對人獰視；而人們對之，也如猜「司芬克司」之謎，覺得神秘得很。</p>
<p>我有一位親戚，忽患外症，中西並治，終難見效。中醫說：「這是隂虧，不易治愈，另請高明。」西醫則說：「如加割治，比較有望。」病家弄得一無辦法，眼見那症日見沈重，急得不得了，於是去請敎那走江湖醫生。他看過之後，即說：「這症雖凶，還不妨事；可是敷藥的成本很重，合一料須十塊大洋。」結果：十元代價，换得了一包白粉。那知病人把它敷了，非但不能稍愈，而且益見潰爛，終於不治而死。我現在還在疑惑那白粉一定自從葫蘆中側出來的。如果這樣，那末一切走江湖醫生攤上所羅列的葫蘆，也並没有什麽神秘；而這「司芬克司」之謎，也不難一猜就着。　來葫蘆這樣東西，要佩在鐵拐李身邊，纔會有妙用；倘若一個在走江湖醫生的攤上，則它的西洋鏡便要拆穿。這也是葫蘆的不幸啊。</p>
<h3>吹</h3>
<p>— 怡怡館主</p>
<p>你不要小看了這個「吹」字，以爲只有這麽七筆，就瞧不起它。要知道，「吹」之爲用很大！</p>
<p>你如果照『吹』的字義來解，自然，只有『嘘氣』之謂也，别無其它的意思。</p>
<p>你如果照『吹』的用處來說，那就多啦。譬如笙簫管笛，只要凡是需要口奏的樂器，都離不了『吹。』要『吹，』然後纔能奏得出悦耳動聽的曲子，使人聽了，不勝歡迎。甚而至於要奉贈你一個『吹』的什麽專家，如『口琴專家』之類，多麽榮耀！</p>
<p>你如果臉皮厚得和牛皮一樣，見了人，儘無中生有，像煞有介事地說：某主席是咱的姊丈，或某部長是咱的妹夫，臉皮不會紅一點，那造化更大了。說不定那花花綠綠的鈔票，雪雪白的洋鈿，自有一般人，情情願願，拿得來孝敬你。爲的是，借此便好拜托你，向你的主席姊丈，或是部長妹夫之前，說項吹嘘，弄一個官兒玩玩，豈不威風！萬一說露了馬脚，顯了狐狸尾巴，那麽，壓根兒也會敬贈你一個『牛皮大王，』或『法螺專家』的頭銜，印上了卡片，也夠闊的了！</p>
<p>唉！你不要小看了這個『吹』字，以爲只有這麽七筆，就瞧它不起。要知道，『吹』之爲用的確很大啊。只要你能彀懂得『吹』的竅，訣便一生吃着不盡，受用無窮！</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十七回　孰能無情家思灰士氣兵不厭詐豪語壯軍心</p>
<p>聽說中央跟西洋某國已經接洽好了，可以借五百架戰鬥飛機給咱們。還有一國，只要是我們這裏一開火，就向小鬼後面進攻。小鬼開到東三省來的軍隊，也不過五六萬人，這樣的前後夾攻，他們怎樣受得了，那是失敗無疑，至於小鬼的飛機我們可以拿高射砲去打它，開到了前綫，上面就會發高射砲給咱們。據說，一團可以得六架高射砲，一營可得四架高射機關槍，那儘夠了。所以我們這次打仗，别以爲人家的器械厲害，我們抵敵不過，須要曉得我們是檢便宜的事。我們若是由熱河衝回奉天去了，咱們東北軍，那是多麽露臉？各位回營連部去，可以好好的鼓勵弟兄們，只管向前進，别洩氣。團長把這一篇話說完了，大家也將信將疑。疑的是天下有這樣便宜的事，有兩國帮了中國來打嗎？信的是，中國軍隊，實在談不上和外國軍隊打仗。現在居然凖備着要打，這必定是有一種什麽凖備。至少向外國借飛機的事，那是假不了的。因之大家初一知道是上喜峯口，各人的臉色，都有點不好看。現在聽說是借有五百架飛機，而且還有兩國帮中國的忙，各人的膽子，同時就壯起來了。趙自强雖然是個老實人，可是俗語說的好，兵不厭詐，一個當軍人的人，只要是富有經騐，自然就會懂得這四個字的訣竅。趙自强心裏也是想着，不管這些話是假是眞，好在不是自己揑造出來的，來源如何，當然，可以找一個人出來負責。所以他回了連部，也就立刻召集全連官長士兵，在樓下院子裏訓話。當大家在院子裏排隊站定了，他就走上石面台階，向大家道：現在有了命令，我們的部隊，開到京東去。我們别以爲向東走，馬上就是回去打奉天，其實我們中國在外國買的幾千架飛機，都還没有到，打的日子，可就早着啦。（二二二）</p>
<h3>小食譜蟹話</h3>
<p>— 殺羽</p>
<p>在這江頭蘆葦，已舖上了一層白雪，楓是紅了，稻是黄了，而那郭索横行的介士，也應時登場，做人們大快朶頥的恩物了。蟹在籬菊著花的暮秋時光，確巳腦肥腸滿，脂黄充實，在這魚米之鄉之蘇州，那聲聲啘囀的賣蟹聲，當清晨飛上枕來，做成一派秋令的市聲。蟹，確是暮秋當令的食品。</p>
<p>▲蟹的種類　蟹是和蝦同種的甲殼動物，八足二鰲，宜水宜陸；他的種類，大約可分三種；一，清蟹，（清水蟹）二，沙蟹，（鹹水蟹）三，海蟹。湖蟹生長在淡水裏面，所以他的肉兒，很是鮮美。蟹是一種蜕殼的動物，他在蜕殼的時候，那甲胄般的蟹斗，先行脱下，然後從蟹身中蜕化出來，那時新蟹的殼十分柔軟，伏在地上。須經過若干時候，方才硬化。蟹經過了一度蜕化才能長大若干。湖蟹到了八九月裏，都已長大得像小碗大了，脂黄充盈，足供大嚼。湖蟹以陽澄湖蟹，最稱佳品，那種蟹，爪上的毛，閃閃似金，能夠在紅木檯上爬行，所以呌做金爪陽澄蟹。</p>
<p>▲蟹的形態　蟹的形態，大都是在蟹斗前面，生着兩隻鋼鉗般的巨鰲；那種螯有有兩片鋸齒的牙鉗，可以箝取食物，也可作爲武器。蟹在横行當兒，逢到了敵人，那兩隻鰲就威武地奮鬭開來，整備决鬭，給他夾着了，很不容易解開哩。蟹的鰲普通大都是兩隻相等的，但是有一種紅殼的小蟹，一隻鰲特别的大，差不多和蟹身一般大小，但另一隻螯，却小得和蝦鉗一般。蟹斗的形狀，有的是橢圓形，有的是梭子形，有大，有小，顔色也有青，紅，黑，黄，各各不同的色彩。殺羽在東吳大學動物標本室裏，已見到了七十多種形態不同的蟹。世間的蟹，當然還不止此數。不過雌雄的判别，雄者睛尖，雌者睛團，却是一例的。</p>
<p>▲蟹的食法　蟹的食法，可分生食熟食兩種。生食的，有醉蟹，鹹蟹。醉蟹取雌蟹（每隻約二三兩重，過大過小，均不相宜。）洗凈後，在臍裏塞些鹽，然後加着等量的酒和醬油；上甏塞緊，大約隔了一星期就可取食了，蟹味香腴鮮美就可下酒，又可佐粥。鹹蟹是祇把蟹浸在鹹滷裏，和寗波的蟹漿一般，鹹則鹹矣，鮮却未必。講到熟食，却也有幾種法兒；最普通的，當然是大紮蟹，取大蟹洗凈，用繩紮好，放在蒸籠或鍋子裏面，下面放着紫蘇，（蟹性寒，紫蘇可解。）和水，將水煮沸，蟹也就蒸熟了；蘸着醬油薑酷，大嚼起來，眞是肥腴鮮美，不但大飽口福，並且持鰲賞菊，還是雅人韻事哩；其次是揀小些的蟹，切開了，和着麫粉青菜煮食，蘇州呌「油醬蟹，」是味很鮮美的飯菜。此外還有炒蟹粉，和芙蓉蟹等食法都是將蟹預先出了肉，然後煮食的。吃起來，省力是省力了。</p>
<p>蟹性極寒，所以吃的當兒，必須和薑同食，才能解除寒氣。好得這時候的新薑，又嫩又淡，也是出色當令的東西。不過吃蟹之後最好飮一盃薑糖湯，不可飮茶，和杮子同食，更有性命的危險。這是吃蟹萬不能不知的常識。蟹螯雄的有黑絨似的軟毛，將兩片螯併，合起來，貼在牆上，很像二隻蝴蝶。蟹爪也可做黄狼，將一節小脚，在中央和爪尖的節環裏，裝進四隻爪尖，放在檯上，就活像一隻黄狼了。此外關於蟹的俗語，像「呌化子吃死蟹，隻隻好」，事情出乎意料的，呌「死蟹夾死人」；一個不如一個，呌「一蟹不如一蟹」等都是。寫在這裡，以做蟹話的結束。</p>

<h3>不可觸的</h3>
<p>— 致立</p>
<p>在歐戰前一年，印度科哈特（Ｃluat）地方，發生過這樣一件奇事：</p>
<p>一個信印度敎的富人的兩歳的兒子，墜於庭院的井中。他的父親不在家，母親站在井邊呼救，而四鄰也没有男人。恰好一個賤氓走過，自願救出這孩子。然而做母親的拒絕他，寗願讓她的孩子淹死，而不敎賤氓汚瀆他們的井水。</p>
<p>印度的賤氓階級賤到如何程度，看這故事就可知道，其實不看這故事，單看這階級的另一種名稱也就可以知道。原來他們是也被呌做Ｉnfouchabeh，「不可觸」階級的。</p>
<p>所謂「不可觸」，該有兩方面的意思，一方面，是說别的階級是神聖的高貴的，他們的一切，不准卑汚的賤氓階級觸到，這和原始民族間所行的Ｔaboo相同。另一方面，是說賤氓階級太卑汚了，别的階級不可去觸到他們，一觸到，自身的清白恐會被玷汚。</p>
<p>印度的階級之别，原是征服者的雅利安人用以防閑被征服的德拉維第安人的。爲求更妥當起見，在人爲的階級制度上又加上一種宗敎的意味，規定婆羅門敎爲上層階級的特權，而把下層階級擯於宗敎範圍之外。於是社會的各集團，分别封鎖在各個小範圍中，彼此不相觸。這樣的維持天下的太平。</p>
<p>中國不是一個宗敎的國，但是代替宗敎的妙用的東西，也是有的，即所謂禮義。「禮義之大防」的一個「防」字，作爲Ｔaboo的譯名，該是最適切的。</p>
<p>「禮不下庶人，刑不上大夫」，中國的上等人和下等人是這樣的不相觸的。不過中國人比印度人又有不同。據中國的「禮」，男女的手是不可相觸的，但孟夫子說，嫂溺也可援之以手，這是「權」。印度人可不懂得「權」，所以上文所說的那位太太寗可斷送愛兒的性命。但這和「失節事大，餓死事小」的態度，可又相同。</p>
<h3>「原諒」和「張目」</h3>
<p>— 陶徒然</p>
<p>最近的自由談上，發表了一篇半關於青年寫别字的文章，半篇是豐之餘先生的「感舊以後」，一篇是曹聚仁先生的「談别字」。豐先生文中的意思，據我看只是原諒寫錯字的青年，蓋剛畢業的中學生寫錯個把字實屬情有可原。不過寫錯終究是寫錯，加以原諒固可以，說他是對總不能，故豐先生的結論是：</p>
<p>現在有兩個人在這里：一個是學生，文中寫「留學生」爲「流學生」，錯了一個字；一個是大學敎授，就得意洋洋的做了一首詩，曰，「先生犯了彌天罪，罰往西天把學流，應是九流加一等，麵筋熬盡一鍋油。」我們看罷，可笑是在那一面呢？</p>
<p>只說「可笑是在那一面」，而不說錯是在那一面，我們可以知道豐先生對於寫錯字的青年，只是恕而已矣。曹先生可不然了，一則曰：「寫别字讓别字乃是我們應享的權利」，再則曰：「從前人寫别字，美其名曰「假借」：難道古人假借得，我們就假借不得？」三則曰：「我以爲中國文字，艱於記憶，本身上應謀徹底改革。目前治標辦法，惟有順讀别字寫别字的趨勢，養成多讀别字多寫别字的習慣；（這也可說是古法。）因爲這一來，在社會上已有根柢的「簡字」，方能爲自稱讀古書的知識分子所認識；而半從音半從形的新形聲字，方有産生的可能。」</p>
<p>竟認「養成多讀别字多寫别字的習慣」爲易於記憶中國文字的「目前治標」辦法了。若然，則曹先生的尊姓大可寫作曹，因爲「曲日曹」是在「社會上已有根柢」的了，又那個别字的「别」字，大可寫作「白」字，「讀白字」「寫白字」在社會上也已有根柢的了。</p>
<p>青年寫錯了字丨丨作錯了事同丨丨博士先生們不應一味挖苦，只該原諒（同時還加以指正）是對的，但若引經據典的爲之張目，我想是錯悮的。「留學生」寫作「流學生」終究是寫錯。所以我們不作詩嘲笑，而好好的說你寫錯了下次請注意，是對的，若說留學生去留總坐船，船總是順流而下，故寫作「流學生」也對，則是錯悮。</p>
<h3>論詞藻</h3>
<p>— 梁樹東</p>
<p>近見豐之餘先生和施蟄存先生關於「莊子與文選」一問題的爭辯，頗引起我一點感想。我於文學全然是門外漢，不過前幾年也偶爾兼代過國文課，那時頗有一點經騐，後來還常常要有所觸動，不免記下來。施先生推薦莊子與文選兩部書的意思，只在要救濟青年詞藻的貧窮，這是一個「事實」問題，許多青年的確有知道的字眼太少之感，關於此，我願意把我的一點經騐寫出來。</p>
<p>莊子文選一類的書，固然不是洪水猛獸，非「法定的」不可讀，但是要看以什麽態度來讀，若是爲救濟詞藻的貧窮，那就絕不可讀。我從前曾令學生分别描摹各種活動的情形，有一次是關於飛機的，一個學生只寫了四句俗語，說：軋軋的響着，慢慢的升到空中，漸漸的望不見了，只見一只蜻蜓。</p>
<p>另外有一個學生，寫了一大篇，中有「如列子之御風，飄飄然遊乎太虚之空」，又有什麽「騎鯨」，「帝宫」之類。照我們的習慣以詞藻論，自然是後者典雅多了，但是若眞正以「描寫飛機情狀」這個目標來說，他何嘗把飛機描寫出來？我原帶點頑固氣，本心喜後者這個學生讀的古書多，但是眞以文學來說，即按唐宋八大家的批評方法，也只有說前一個學生的四句俗話是上選了。他把「機聲」，機的「飛行」都說了，快要看不見時，還輕輕用「蜻蜓」把遠望的「機形」畫出來。這些「字眼」，是由「讀書」得來的呢？還是由官能感觸得來的呢？</p>
<p>因爲這樣，我悟到詞藻的來源，應從現實的事物上求，經騐多，觀察多，自然會寫出種種情狀，知道了某某狀態，當然要想「字」來形容，即使暫時有寫不出的字，他也要找去，若没有事，只有字，他那些字會做什麽呢？莊子的開篇兩句，「北溟有魚，其名爲鯤」，讓學生多知道了「溟」，「鯤」兩個字，他除儲藏在腦中外，能排他什麽用場呢？文選上的字固然多，但是若要用來記述現在的機器等新事物，或用來叙述各種學問，恐怕文選正要感詞藻的貧窮。况且若要用莊子文選等來豐富學的生字眼，那似乎不如直接了當，令學生背誦康熙字典或辭源，還較完備點。</p>
<h3>澉涌通信（六）</h3>
<p>— 阿英</p>
<p>○○兒：</p>
<p>現在可以談談鹽價和税率了。鹽價　　從成本說起的。大概每燒一盤鹽，需要六擔滷，每擔一百六十斤，合價的一元左右。這一千斤的滷，可以燒成一百六十斤鹽。柴約一元二角。人工要三個，以每日計，工資三元。此外則爲油，火，，石灰，點心，雜費，等等開銷。燒鹽時，要向官廳領牌，每燒一日，繳費兩元八角。每天連早帶晚，至多可以趕到十六盤，合鹽一千五百六十斤。計算成本，每引（卽三百斤，合兩盤）總要五元二角左右。可是，在每天所燒的鹽中，兩定例，是必需以四元八角一引的價錢，賣四引（卽八包）給「鹽公堂」作爲官鹽的，這就是說，一定要有四引，每引蝕本大洋四角的讓給「鹽公堂」作官鹽去賣。燒鹽旣然蝕本，鹽民爲什麽還要做這一種買賣呢？原因很簡單，就是燒鹽的人自己還可以留下一引多鹽去作私鹽賣，在這裏撈回損失，並賺一點錢。燒官鹽是蝕本的，但附帶的，也是公開的，撈一點私鹽的利益，這纔維持了他們的生計。但鹽民的開銷，是不止於此的，還有許多必要的溻費。</p>
<p>燒鹽的人究竟是些什麽人呢？自己有鹽灶的人，燒自己的滷，或者除自有的以外，再向一般的鹽民買滷燒。没有灶的人，把滷賣給有灶的朝奉，或者出租金給朝奉自己來燒。也有幾個鹽民合力建立的灶。在燒鹽前，先去領照，燒完了，馬上要到城裏繳銷。在燒時，常常有鹽警來查照，如果没有照，而是私燒，這事灶是要　　的。每　灶，成本要一千多元，纔能建築成功，私燒的事，因此很少很少。燒價漲，他們　做「煎牌，」用藍色印成，約五寸長，四寸寬，寫着「牌到開煎，熄火隨繳，」「以杜私煎，而憑查核，」以及燒鹽人的姓名，開煎時日等等。鹽燒成了，那作爲了官鹽的除化了成本以外，還要加上税，成本五元二角，加上税六元四角，方能正式發賣出去。如果你不打算賣到遠方，祇在二十里路以内賣，那呌做「輕税鹽，」每引只要納一元的税。但是，二十里之内，究竟能銷幾多鹽呢？官鹽的價錢，成本巳經超過十元一引，售價當然很貴。其間輕税的一種，較爲便宜。私鹽的價錢不一，平時賣二元左右一擔，有時也賣三四元。據我向鹽民訪問的結果，說是每年官賣的鹽約佔全産額的三分之二，其餘一分，則全作私鹽運出。關於販私鹽的「鹽梟，」當另函來說。</p>
<p>鹽務機關，在以前有「場公署」，現在是改爲了「秤放局」。以前有「卡」，「緝私營」，現在，大約「卡」没有了。據說，以前的緝私營的黑幕最多，他們不時的用種種方法到鹽民間去敲詐，或者說他們私燒，或者說他們停火太早，或者說他們斤量不符，以及種種其他的理由。在「卡」的一方面，則專與商人船户爲難，或說斤量不符，或說包數不符，以遂其敲詐之私。所以，鹽的成本雖極其輕微，但加上了税，敲詐，剥削，到了人們的菜蔬裏，已經是非常高貴了，其實，鹽民是得不着什麽的。在鹽民間，使你時時聽到的，只是他們不斷的呌苦。這是民十七以前的情形。</p>
<h3>兩兄弟（八）</h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑著　李維克譯</p>
<p>當牠走到距離（珍珠）號釣船狠近時，羅蘭老爹揚着他的帽子，兩個女人摇着她們的手帕，六七頂小陽傘便也狠厲害的在那郵船上摇蕩着表示答禮，船走過了，還留下一些迂徐的波動，在牠身後那平靜的輝煌的海面。</p>
<p>我們還可以看到别的頭上籠着黑烟的輪船，遠遠的從四面八方向這短而白的堤岸奔來，這堤岸正像一張口一樣，把牠們一隻一隻地全吞下了。那些在水天交接處溜走着的輕桅大帆船，由一些小得看不見的小汽船拖着，或慢或快的一齊向這吃人的惡魔奔來，這惡魔有時候也好像吃得太飽了，向大海裏擲出另一些郵船，兩桅貨船，兩桅快行船，和載着一些縱横的杈掗的三桅船等。那些急行着的汽船，或左或右的向大洋的坦腹上逃走了，而那些被拉縴的小汽艇丢下的帆船則靜止着不動，正在丨從大桅棚起到小桅止丨拉上白的或棕色的布帆，這些布帆在落日裏面看來好像紅的一樣。</p>
<p>羅蘭太太半閉着眼睛，喃喃地說道；</p>
<p>「天啊，這海景多美啊！」</p>
<p>陸醉米太太帶着一聲悠長的，但却没有絲毫凄凉意味的歎息回答：</p>
<p>「是啦，但牠有時做出狠多壞事呢。」</p>
<p>羅蘭老爹呌道：</p>
<p>「看啦，「諾曼底」號在港口出現了。你們看牠大不大，嚇」？</p>
<p>隨後他便把對面的海岸，那邊，那邊，塞萊河河口另一面的海岸說明給大家聽，「這河口有二十公里」，他說。他又指出威爾威而，特洛威而，奥爾伽特，卡恩河，盧克，亞洛曼施，和那使得航行危險到奢埠才止的卡爾瓦多礁石。他更討論着塞萊河的沙帶問題，這沙帶每逢漲潮一次便要移動位置，連基爾柏孚的領港們倘不每天走過那航路，也會要發生意外的。他又呌人注意到哈佛爾怎樣的分離上諾曼底（Ｈaute　Normandic）的淺灘。在下諾曼底（BasseNormendie）那方面，平坦的海岸降下來成爲牧塲，草原，耕地，直連海濱。上諾曼底的海岸則恰恰相反，它是直立着的，它是一道經過斧鑿的，凸凹不平的，雄偉的懸崖，綿互着成爲一條無際的白色的城壁，直到丹克爾格爲止，而這斷岸的每一個小灣都藏着一個村落或一個埠頭，如：愛特爾達，非剛，聖瓦勒里，勒特慮波，狄愛甫，等是。</p>
<p>兩個女人全没有注意他的話，她們巳被幸福陶醉了，她們看着大洋上滿是船舶，而這些船舶正像許多獸類在牠們的洞口附近一般跑着，簡直看得出神了：她們一聲不響，浩瀚的水和天使她們感到了自身的渺小，温和而又壯麗的落日使她們驚歎到無言可說。祇有羅蘭老爹一人，滔滔不絕地說着：他是一個什麽都不會使他擾亂的人。女人們比較神經過敏一點，常是莫明其妙地感着一種無用的語聲正同一種粗俗的言辭一樣使人難受。</p>
<p>筆爾和哲安這時已平靜了，都慢慢地划着；而那在許多大船旁邊顯得異常渺小的「𤦬珠」號釣船，便向碼頭駛去。　（未完）</p>

<h3>紗花　散漫的標紗</h3>
<p>紗市極其涣散、毫無興奮氣象、本月下降之勢、被某會限制以後、一般投機者皆束手觀望、於是交易大爲减少、市價遂呈刻板文章矣、每日僅二三角上落、但現紗銷路益覺沉寂、將後之變化、未敢逆料、</p>
<h3>軟的人標</h3>
<p>人標前市開盤、市氣頗疲、場中買户缺乏、漲跌互見、各月升降一·二·三·角、午後聞現紗生意較清、市氣稍軟、各月跌一·二·三·四·角、全日成交統計一萬三千八百包、查賣出賡豐七百包、同興七百五十包、長豐四百五十包、買進榮興六百五十包、泰昌四百包、大豐三百五十包、仁豐四百包、義成四百包、收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>本月花突然軟化　丨風傳某號有二萬担交貨丨</h3>
<p>棉市略軟、最堅挺之十月份標花、突現疲弱之狀、因環境平淡、現棉需要不暢、故有一部份多頭稍形了結、另有一說、某家有二萬担交貨、因此市况較平、但本月份拍板時期尚剩兩日、查成交額量尚有十四萬担外、市勢之變動、仍有極大波瀾、</p>

<h3>糧食期粉一致銳漲五六分</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份一致呈激昻之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥又漲一元四角左右、并以國外麥市、巳連漲三四日、且因美總統之經濟復興、提高物價、由此推測、前途似有良好之望、故開價後、各月份均又步好、計較前日好二分外、迨至下午開盤、各月份又呈狂提之態、因據私人之電訊、坎拿大報價亦漲一元外、而各廠自爲交易所限制證金以來、雖貨量依然充足、不顧掉期抛賣、一般投機浮多、利用此種時機、盡力抬價、以空方旣少大户之抛售、多方不免有挾而求、任意高喊也、本月份聞廠家有收進表示、漲度亦銳、結果本月份較前日漲六分二釐半、十一月份漲五分半、十二月份漲六分、一二月份漲六分二釐半、三月份漲五分半云、</p>
<h3>洋麥輸華暫可毋慮期麥現極猛銳之漲風</h3>
<p>昨期麥上下午開盤後、各月份一致呈狂騰之態、以洋麥報價、續見高漲、芝加哥漲一元四角零、坎拿大無市、市場人心因洋麥之連漲不巳、及美總統之提高物價、巳有良好之表現、似乎此後洋麥之輸華、暫時可免顧慮、所以開盤後、各月份卽步步高騰、漲勢之盛、亦覺可畏、而市塲方面、又傳廠家將吸收現貨、爲將來維持物價之張本、因此近遠期遂同趨昻貴也、結果本月份較漲八分、十一月份漲一角一分、十二月一月份漲一角二分、二月份漲一角、三月漲九分、現麥市面、交易見暢、價亦轉挺、高貨提三五分不等、開山東麥三元九角、次八角六分、瑶灣麥三元八角四分、高郵麥三元六角七八分、揚州麥三元六角半、次六角二分、塘市麥三元六角半、常熟麥三元六角三分、南京麥三元四角七分、無錫麥三元五角、由阜豐辦去四千包、信大去四千包、申大去六百包云、</p>
<h3>到接米價又回小</h3>
<p>（滬南）來源近五十號、來貨又湧、雖本胃稍佳、包胃續辦窰中千包左右、然趨勢已難立足、各帮新粳及窰中有哥白稻野稻等花色貨、均跌一二角不等、杜洋尖閩帮雖亦動動、而價隨修尺外、其勢似已跌透、且兼售方亦都不願再讓、故明市或恐稍能轉定耳、破粳去路有限、復跌角砠、新隂元以貨乏、獨見挺秀、</p>
<p>（滬北）到貨續湧、約六十餘號、去胃揀巧、殺價略化、市形新更破更價小二三角、窰種白稻羊杜埠尖價小角許、百果白元隂元平疲之格、客尖價修近角、</p>
<h3>新生仁客銷已成僵局</h3>
<p>新生仁因祗銀本街一路走化、故市面疲軟、加以近日來源蜂湧、車輪共到三四千包、致本街無强胃消化、市成僵擯、兩日來一無成交、星期日曾談妥一暗盤交易、係山東貨、開百餘包、價爲八元、此價不能依作正市、餘均先行出貨、而後聽盤作價、照業中人云、其市須再削元譜、廣汕帮或可走動云、</p>
<h3>絲茶洋莊絲銷生氣毫無</h3>
<p>▲温哥武竟無華絲運往　温哥武絲織廠林立、生絲消費亦鉅、近年來因日絲廉價傾銷、華絲備受影響、然每歳尚有四五千包運往、兹因工潮蔓延、温哥武絲織廠大半停工、華絲走銷竟告停頓、昨日昌興亞后郵船開出、竟無華絲運往温哥武云、</p>
<p>▲蕭山繭衣到八十件　蕭山爲浙省模範蠶區、今歳繭産頗豐、而繭價不高、蠶户大半自烘自繅、剥下之繭衣、由餘繭客搜集運滬、售與洋莊、昨日又有繭客徐仲記裝到蕭山白繭衣八十件、聞已抛與法商、預備交解、</p>
<p>▲人造絲客銷難暢　内地絲織廠現均開織冬綢、人造絲需要日減、客銷難暢、昨祗紹帮進金麒麟·飛鷹等牌現貨十五箱、價祗一百八十元七角半至一百七十五元二角半、凈盤、</p>
<p>▲白廠經綢銷疲滯　海外絲市之不景氣、日甚一日、紐約現絲無人問訊、里昻實銷呆滯如故、時局嚴重、絲銷一時無轉機、即國内綢門銷路亦趨　落、昨祗杭綢廠進Ｂ級白廠經十五包、（係美莊退貨）印莊進黄絲三包、價亦傾賤云、</p>
<h3>土莊珍眉法銷略動</h3>
<p>昨日土莊茶廠所製之珍眉綠茶、因法銷忽趨活動、全市共由天裕永興等行、買進三百餘箱、修價自五十四元至六十六元、市盤頗爲堅硬、至路莊針眉綠茶、英莊怡和協和等行、對於上中莊貨、搜買仍勁、惟蠟光珍眉、及各路貢熙綠茶等項、全市均無交易云</p>
<h3>糖市　疲弱愈甚一無成交</h3>
<p>昨日糖市因十月底將屆、銀根緊急、以致各路銷胃呆滯異常、公會劃盤趨勢疲軟愈甚二四粗砂白仍呌二十一元三角、竟至無人還價、其餘各貨呌價與前日相仿、均乏受手、後市勞必不振也</p>
<h3>南北貨核桃劃申難合</h3>
<p>核桃近日申市銷路尚佳、查各行存底亦不豐、趨勢穩定但地價較申市尤高、故難合劃、來源遂稀、昨市行盤如手揀桃售二十元、昌平桃十八元、亳桃十三元八角、南桃十三元半、桃肉三十二元、</p>
<h3>疋頭花洋布漲勢愈銳</h3>
<p>花洋布以成本奇重、存貨寥寥、賣方均行居奇、市氣因之更呈堅銳、昨德記五路進寳花洋布原箱一律售六角凈盤、拆疋選色加二分半、門莊零剪每碼入洋六角五六分（按前零剪祗有五角耳、</p>
<h3>五金花旗白鐵行情步鬆</h3>
<p>花旗白鐵、目下出路不甚活潑、現貨供過於求、行情步鬆、計四十八張估十九元五角、三十八張二十一元二角半、三十三張十九元二角半、二十五張十八元五角、查連日交易除漢口一帶客帮微有採辦外、别帮殊少指染、</p>
<h3>湖南青鉛現貨大缺</h3>
<p>湖南青鉛、自漢陽兵工廠收羅後、來申現貨奇少、市上流通貨大感缺乏、行情步高、刻估十六元、比前好起二角餘、聞後批來貨尚遥遥無期、行情頗有再好之可能云、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>戰爭的怒號</h3>
<p>— 賓符</p>
<p>住在「歌舞昇平」的上海這個圈子專的人們，誰曾想到戰爭的恐怖呢？他們只做着粉紅色的夢，追求着神秘的快樂。有時他們在電影院中也看到了戰爭的影片，恐怖的戰景雖也使他們心驚肉跳，情緒緊張，然而他們决不感着這樣的「恐怖」有朝一日會臨到他們的頭上的。他們以爲這只是「影戲」而巳。他們是一羣多　柔弱的緜羊啊，雖然他們在足球塲裏跑狗場裏回力球塲裏的呐喊儘是氣壯聲宏的，雖然他們在開時講到十九路軍大月隊殺敵的情形，儘是眉飛色舞的，然而他們實際是一羣多麽柔弱的緜羊啊！</p>
<p>「一九三五年在遠東要發生了偉大的戰爭了麽？誰說的？威爾斯麽？洋鬼子的話靠不住的！」聰明的人於是去問「小糊塗」，因爲他們只信仰「小糊塗」，可是「小糊塗」再三說是不會的呢！於是他們安慰了，他們是一羣多麽柔弱的緜羊啊！他們是典型的中國人</p>
<p>不過，「粉紅色」的「幸福」的人們啊，我們固然不必過信威爾斯，但却更不必過信「小糊塗」，我們應當分析，觀察，認識眞正的事實，事實究竟是怎樣的呢？願你們跳出「歌舞昇平」的圈子來瞭望一番圈子外面的景色罷：</p>
<p>東北角上瀰漫着的殺氣騰騰的黑雲，說不定會使過慣了「温柔和平」生活的你們打個寒噤罷，這就是，狡滑的日帝國主義和「西伯利亞之熊」將决鬥的徵兆。最近，蘇聯這隻白熊發表了日本帝國主義隂謀刦奪中東路的秘密文件，日本帝國主義便惱羞成怒，終於向着蘇聯翻臉了，日本對蘇聯作戰的凖備，早巳成爲公開的事實　，而且巳達非常充分的程度，一向維持着和平外交政策的蘇聯，深感到戰爭之終難挽回，日本軍閥黷武的野心之終難徹斂，因此也就强硬地怒吼起來了，這麽着，狐狸和白熊便陷於劍拔弩張的狀態，遠東的風雲便頓時的險惡起來了，日本的「非常時國策」爲了什麽？日本的「五相會議」爲了什麽？還不是爲了戰爭的籌備嗎？</p>
<p>雖然前日美國羅斯福巳預備承認蘇俄，人們以爲這足爲遠東戰機的暫時清醒劑，我想這是没有多大的效用的，日本的軍人不是作過驚人的豪語麽：他們將以陸軍打敗蘇聯，以海軍征服美國，其瘋狂的野心恐怕是不易挽回了，遠東的戰爭也許就是第二次大戰地序幕。</p>
<p>同時在西方，希特勒向日内瓦投下一個大炸彈，使歐洲的局勢大變，帝國主義的軍備戰經濟戰日益尖鋒深刻，戰爭的危機也更加深了。</p>
<p>總之，東方和西方是有深切關係的，戰爭的怒號，已震動了世界，全世界除了中國以外都忙着在籌備第二次的大屠殺。這次的戰爭，難道和中國没有關係麽？不，中國的最後命運，簡直要在這次的戰爭中决定啊！</p>
<p>啊，柔弱的緜羊們啊，在這個决定我們命運的大毁滅的前夜我們將是瘋狂地歌着舞着「樂他一個最後的今宵」呢？還是預備毅然决然地跳出粉紅色的圈子來怒吼一下？</p>
<h3>籃球塲上</h3>
<p>— 敬嘉</p>
<p>飯後，籃球場上鬧熱起來了。聚着二三十個同學，跳着跑着，呌着。</p>
<p>球塲旁的宿舍的樓上的扶攔旁站着幾個女同學，靜靜地看男同學玩球。</p>
<p>爲了有女生在旁督促，似乎替男生加油，男同學們都很努力地抛着球。每當有人丢進籃去，他一定會翻着眼向女生瞟一眼。如果有人丢不進，其他的人就大聲地笑，駡他没用。各人都盡力地顯露他們博女同學歡心的手段。</p>
<p>事件就這樣地發生了。矮胖子接着了球，賣弄他的手段，故意在球塲上跑一圈再丢，可是一不留心，被塲上的砂礫滑了一交。這當然使其他的人拍手大笑。可是矮胖子却氣起來了。他並非爲笑而生氣，他是爲了在女同學前出醜而惱羞成怒。</p>
<p>於是他爬了起來，搶了球，使勁向站着的人身上丢。被丢着的是鐵牛老李，當然不肯干休，便搶了球回擲，擲不中，兩個人扭着打起來了。</p>
<p>旁邊聚集了不少看熱鬧的同學，呼喊助威。在「花樓」上的女同學都夷鄙不屑地回進屋中去了。</p>
<p>不約而同，兩人没經人勸解就停止了！好像他們故意在女則學前演三本鐵公鷄似的。女看客旣巳退場，當然他們也只能停鑼。</p>
<p>只有老陳看透了他們的心理，他嘆了一口氣，說：女子眞是禍水！</p>
<h3>新生</h3>
<p>— 鶯</p>
<p>是今天午後的事，我吃過了午飯回到宿舍裏來，轉入了駝底房間裏，他伸手指着窗外樓下的一堆人說：</p>
<p>「看，那邊有個女人正在養小孩子呢！」</p>
<p>我不信，我以爲他和我開玩笑，但他正經地說：</p>
<p>「眞的，誰騙你呢！」</p>
<p>「好，待我親自去打聽。」</p>
<p>我半信半疑地走到樓下宿舍的後門外，果然，那邊站着十幾位同學，他們都注視着小河的對岸。於是，我也混入在他們的人羣中。</p>
<p>我們學校底四周環繞着一條小河，河畔種着許多碧綠的楊柳，那婦人就坐在對岸小路旁的田土上。我們從隔岸看過去，被幾條柳條阻擋着，祗能清楚地看到她底上半身，下身似乎遮着塊灰黑色的破布。她彎着背坐着，似乎顯得極度的疲乏。年紀大約近四十歳了，臉色黄黑，穿着件半舊的藍土布衫，這分明是個可憐的貧窮的勞動者。</p>
<p>旁邊聚着七八個婦人、　和她談着。牠放鬆衣鈕露出新生出來的孩子給他們看。她們同情伊，幫助伊，有的拿來些舊布，有的拿杯水來給她喝：她們剛從附近田間跑來，也都穿着土布衫，頭上戴着塊布手巾，臉色黄黑，和牠一樣的貧窮的勞動者啊！</p>
<p>有一個同學包着件舊衣服，呌對岸的小孩涉水送過去，她點點頭接受了，表示感謝。</p>
<p>過後她動着嘴似乎是對我們講，但我們聽不到她的句語。後來她旁邊立着的一個農婦傳給我們聽，大意是這樣：！</p>
<p>她是江北人，丈夫在吳淞做裁縫。這次因爲要生産了，家裏没有人，又没有錢，所以特地出來找她底丈夫、但在吳淞找了三天找不到，今天走過這裏，就聲痛生産了。</p>
<p>我聽了極感動。我想：假使她家裏</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>有錢，她早已在前三四個月請好了頂有名的産科醫生了，或是上個月就進ＸＸ醫院了，并且，乳媽，小孩子底新衣裳，也早預備好了。可是她是一個貧窮的勞動者啊！唉，可憐的貧窮的婦人啊！和不幸的剛出世就受苦的孩子啊！</p>
<p>宿舍裏傳出來一陣胡琴聲和口琴聲，悠揚地，歡欣地，像是在慶祝這個孩子的新生。　九，二八，吳淞</p>
<h3>「服務至上主義」</h3>
<p>— 之</p>
<p>從前在學校裏的時候，常常的聽校長敎務長以及許多所謂學者名流們關於「青年問題」的演說。其中講到「職業」問題的時候，我記得他們老是這樣忠厚誠懇地告訴我們：青年人在離開學校而走向社會去辦事，應當要有服務的精神；要能夠忍耐忠實地爲國家社會謀幸福而幹，那末將來的成就是不可限量的。假使說，單單爲了吃飯謀生而去找職業，那是再狹義不過，甚至是不通的解釋。因爲「爲吃飯而職業」只是一種可鄙的自私的行爲，於國家社會是絕對找不到甚麽利益的；「爲服務而職業」，才是每個青年人都應當牢牢記着的。……</p>
<p>這些話，在剛走出學校大門的那兩年，我的確是深深地把它刻劃在心頭，可是，幾年以來，事實的答覆，知道他們都是騙人的！請問：誰能夠拼了肚子的餓而去談「服務至上主義」嗎？他們是欺人的騙子呀！</p>
<p>前不多天，本刊上有一位作家談「職業」。意思大概與那些曾經所領敎過的所謂學者名流與校長敎長之類的騙子們相類似的。這位作家是這樣大聲疾呼的亂喊：「以謀獲生活資料所發生的行爲」「其對象僅僅是經濟」的職業，意義未免太狹隘了。所以，他（當然是這位作家囉！）并且諄諄地說明了關於找職業的所謂三個基本條件來：（一）須顧及自己的興趣：（二）要看才力之配稱與否：（三）要看對於一般的社會貢獻怎樣。最後，他還對「已有職業的與正在謀職業而有把握的朋友」提出「敬業」「樂業」「恒業的三個格言式的口號。</p>
<p>我把這篇大作差不多讀到爛熟，於是我乃開始推測這位作家一定是開了三十塊錢一天的房間而寫這篇大文章的，至少，也當然是洋房三層樓上朝南窗子的主人！不然，話是何以會如此其像吮着薄荷香糖，吐出氣來香噴噴地而怪覺得腦袋子風凉清爽呢？</p>
<p>然而，事實擺在我們眼面前，呌我們不能不承認這位作家的話，也是近於開玩笑的欺騙。我們展開眼看吧，在我們的這個社會裏，我們很容易發現有好些從美國學醫回國來做政治家，在德國學數理回國來幹政治經濟的德文譒譯，至於學科學回來做小說，學敎育回來開工廠辦實業等等我們是一時無法例舉得清的。若是要適應我們的這位作家的「才力的配稱」的條件，或是問到「興趣」與「貢獻」的話，那，這一批批冒牌的政治家，譒譯家以及小說家，工業家，實業家等等，都必定應當捆緊了褲子帶凖備去挨餓！（其實，連牌也没得冒而白等着挨餓的，還統計得清嗎？）</p>
<p>我們還眼睜睜地看見許多所謂「有業的朋友」，他們把他們的職業戰戰競競像捧了一碗油，「敬」而且「樂」地守護着，然而，事實上，他們都不能「恒」，簡直一些「安」的時間也没有！</p>
<p>……這些事，這些「三十塊錢一天的房間」或是「洋房三層樓上朝南窗子」以外的像鐵一般確鑿的事，我們的這位作家是絕對看不見的。但是，也能夠拿不　「服務精神」和不合「基本條件」來解釋得通的嗎？「服務至上主義」，只是欺騙，虚僞丨惟有不顧一切的向上奮鬥，才不致於挨餓！</p>
<h3>一件平凡的事</h3>
<p>— 敬嘉</p>
<p>那天我有事到先施公司去，跳上一路電車。在車中空得很，連我只有六個人。賣票員在抽烟捲。車過卡德路時，上來了一個工人模樣的青年。給了賣票的幾個銅元。賣票的没結他票子，只對他點了點頭，說：「朋友」，謝謝你。那青年也没說什麽話，</p>
<p>車到了馬霍路，一個在賣票員目爲「赤老」的查票員在賣票員未留意時進了車廂，第一個就向那青年要票子，賣票員白了臉。</p>
<p>青年向賣票的望了一望，又向查票的看了一看，很慷慨地把手放進袋裏撈出一把銅子。</p>
<p>「到ＸＸ路幾分？」他問。</p>
<p>「那兒上來的？」查票的說。</p>
<p>「ＸＸ路。」</p>
<p>「十四分。」</p>
<p>青年把十四個銅子丢在賣票者的手裏。查票員走開了。</p>
<p>查票的去了之後，賣票的把錢還了那青年，我瞧見他眼中含着涙。他說；「謝謝你！」</p>
<p>那青年只笑了一笑，把錢放進袋中。</p>
<p>我在先施公司前下了車，在路上走時，我在沉思着這一回事。我以爲這是「互助」吧！至少，互助是一種美德。居然，中國人與中國人之間還有這種互助的存在呢！中國亡得了嗎？</p>
<p>我决定，我要寫一部「中國必不亡論。」</p>

<h3>不合法不普及的習慣</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我最愛讀業餘通信，因爲牠包羅許多社會問題的解答，得了不少的知識，這裏先要向編者表示感謝。</p>
<p>我現在有個當前的難題，要請先生替我解决，讓我在下面說來罷！</p>
<p>我是個學過百貨店的學徒，因爲没有兄弟，父母親年老了，不能到外埠去做生意，只得在某橡皮廠做跑街。這裏近我的家庭，家裏的消息，時常可以知道，并便於照料一點。所以我在這裏安身，父母也放心了。但是近來父母又替我掀起一個問題來！</p>
<p>原來我父兄弟兩人，伯父早亡，無後，就由我兼祧伯父之後，其時我年十六歳。現在我已二十八歳了，伯母亦去世了。父親念兄弟手足之情，很要我受二室，分别成立門户。這話，父親當面向我說，或託人對我說，已有好幾次；并想在明年正月裏實行咧！</p>
<p>我以爲這事關係太大，不是輕易弄的。在法律上有没有根據和保證；將來兩房有没有衝突，我實在知識淺薄得很，簡直不懂事，非請</p>
<p>先生替我解决，委實不得明白！久仰先生是青年的指南，是青年的向導，這點瑣屑意思，想來不致河漢吧！敬請在業餘通訊欄内公開的賜示，不勝感荷之至。敬請</p>
<p>著安　黄浚謹上</p>
<p>編者按：最古我國的宗法制度，没有兼祧的辦法，祇規定長房不能無後。所以假使兄弟二人，兄無後而弟僅出一子，那末這個弟之子，應立爲兄之後。有子者反成無後，後來人們感到這辦法的不公允，才把他變通：遇到上面這種情形，立了一個兼祧的辦法。這種爲二人後者的兼祧子，普通祗娶一個妻子，不過所生子女，除非仍係單傳，那末繼續兼祧下去，否則分别承祀。但是也有很少很少的地方，有一種習慣，這種兼祧子可以娶兩個妻子，（即黄君所爲受二室）分别成立門户：習慣旣久，竟忘其有乖理法者。這種習慣，根本不能存在，因爲牠的産生，是根據了不合時宜的宗法。宗法旣爲我人所認爲不能存在，那末牠的産物，就連帶不能存在。况且這種習慣，違反法律規定一夫一婦的制度。你雖然是個兼祧子，在法律上决不能取得兩個人的資格。你若再娶，重婚的罪責，絲毫不能諉卸的。</p>

<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>第四幕　和平禮讚</p>
<p>村長：不，别聽她的話，大爺丨他們糾衆搗亂，要奪保安隊的槍械，所以爲自衛計，便朝天開槍，這個人是流彈打死的。</p>
<p>青年乙：他媽的，這個混蛋眞能夠顚倒是非，明明是開槍殺人，還說是流彈打死的。</p>
<p>日軍官：不准開口，你們這　人全是壞蛋，組織義勇軍來反抗我們大日本的皇家軍。我全知道的。全帶去。怎麽樣？（問村長）我們日本兵維持治安的精神好嗎？</p>
<p>村長：（作揖打拱）好極好極，鄙人不勝欽佩之至！</p>
<p>青年同聲：呸！簡直連狗也不如。</p>
<p>日軍官：不准說話。我知道他是上等的中國人，他是有身份的中國紳士，他說話不會錯的，他聞大日本軍隊告發你們，不是應當的嗎？</p>
<p>青年同聲：打，打死這賣國的劣紳！</p>
<p>村長：你聽，大爺，聽他們說話，全是一些暴徒麽。</p>
<p>日軍官：你們這些孩子，爲什麽不好好的做一個善良百姓呢？孔夫子孟夫人都是你們中國的聖人，他們都敎訓你們安分守己，不要做不道德的事。我們日本，都很尊敬孔夫子孟夫子，實行他們的學說，難道你們中國人反到先賢的哲言嗎？至於我們皇家軍打到關内來，原是替你們打倒不良的軍閥。可是爲了尊重中國土地之完整，所以提得起，放得下，要停戰就停戰，並不想佔領半分土地。這種大公無私的精神，只有我們大和民族的人民才能做到。還有一點，你們更應該明白美國想佔領長江流域，英國想西藏，法國想雲南，還有蘇聯簡直想赤化全中國。在這種情形之下，你們政府和人民没有一點自救的能力，另一方面，却對於同文同種的日本帝國，却一味的抵貨，還有什麽長期抵抗，好像有意開玩笑似的，誰不知你們在這國亡無日的時候，唯一的辦法，只有實行東亞門羅主義，一致抵抗白色人種的侵略。所以你們一味胡鬧的組織義勇軍，來和日本軍隊爲難，這不獨是極其愚笨的行動，而且是自討滅亡罷了。</p>
<p>青年丁：我們不要聽這些屁話。</p>
<p>青年同聲：我們不要聽這些屁話！</p>
<p>日軍官：你們都是一羣猪，好話不聽的，來，他媽的全帶去！</p>
<p>（青年們不肯去，日兵以槍柄毆打。）</p>
<p>村長：那末，大爺，這保安隊的兩根槍，可以給還他們嗎？</p>
<p>日軍官：那不成，他們拿着槍在鄉下殺人，那還成話。現在我們帶回縣裏去。回頭敎縣長來親自領去罷。</p>

<h3>人猿與野猫的聯姻</h3>
<p>— 斯斑</p>
<p>約翰威斯穆勒休妻示愛　羅潑范麗絲婚姻當兒戲</p>
<p>約翰韋斯穆勒（Ｊohny　Weisimuller）大家都知道他是「人猿泰山」裏的主角。他是一位世界聞名的游泳家。他那健康雄偉的體格，是任何人所羨慕的。羅潑范麗絲，是著名的墨西哥的野貓！她初到好萊塢的時候，完全是和「泰山」差不多一個野孩子。他們性情有許多相似的地方。於是就有人猜想着，倘使將這兩個野人配合起來，豈不是一對佳偶！現在這種理想，居然有了實現的希望了。非但有希望，並且可以說將來一定會成功的。</p>
<p>羅潑范麗絲自己都已經宣佈了。她說；「等到約翰韋斯穆勒一得到自由，我們就可以結婚了。」這是什麽話，豈不等於一種訂婚的宣言嗎？但是須要記得羅潑本來就是個野孩子，她這種大胆的話，或是一種隨便說說的。不過大家總希望她，不要今天說了，明天就忘記就好了。從前羅潑范麗絲和加雷古柏已經有過一次羅曼絲，亦跟現在她和韋斯穆勒一樣，恐怕還要厲害些。她和加雷的婚期，已經定好了；一切都籌備好了：地方是在加利福尼亞深山中的一個小城；他們已經决定好了他們秘密同去。照當地的法律，未婚夫婦呈報官廳之後，要過了三天纔可以正式結婚。他們同去到了山中，過了三天。誰知臨到結婚的那天，她忽然變了卦，不要結婚了。加雷因爲她是不受禮貌拘束的野孩子，所以亦不和她計較，就媽媽虎虎地分開了。現在難道又要演這一齣把戲嗎？</p>
<p>聽說這次羅潑范麗絲是眞心愛韋斯穆勒的。但是韋斯穆勒是個有婦之夫。他的娘子，是呌寳蓓恩納絲。可是羅潑愛上他了，恐怕是因爲他健壯雄偉的體格吧。她拒絕了許多有錢的男子，她不再收受他們的金鋼鑽的鐲子和銀狐的皮大衣了。她常常和約翰韋斯穆勒接近。因此，那時有三位女新聞記者，在米高梅的攝影場上，看見羅潑是不理睬她的。這事給羅潑知道了，就等這三位女記者來，問她們「爲什麽你們肯不和我談話？」那三位女記者就痛痛快快地駡了她一頓。她們說：「你這種女人，太不要臉了。你破壞約翰韋斯穆勒的家庭。我們是看不起這種女人的？」羅潑就立刻打發人請了約翰韋斯穆勒來，當了那三位女記者之面，向約翰說道「我從今以來，不能再和你見面了。我不能爲你受破壞家庭的罪名。」</p>
<p>羅潑范麗絲現在提起了這件事，她就要笑起來的。她說那時她並没有眞的愛約翰，不過和他稍爲接近而已。可是自從那三位女記者提醒了她，她倒覺得約翰是實在可愛的人了。她常常說「這事眞奇怪極了。人家呌你不要做的事，你偏偏要去做。好像小孩子似的，你告訴他這東西不好吃的，他偏要吃。好萊塢呌我不可以愛約翰韋斯穆勒的，可是我眞的愛上他了。其實這個念頭，最初還是那三位女新聞記者放在我腦筋裏的呢。」</p>
<p>現在約翰韋斯穆勒眞的已經和他的娘子離婚了，他並且曾經跟了羅潑范麗絲游過一趙紐約。他們混在一起的時候，快活得很。但不知他們到底什麽時候結婚，倘是再要變卦的話，那太對不起這位「人猿」休妻求愛的一番周折了。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「恐怖之夜」Ｐuppts　of　Fate</h3>
<p>— 凌鴻</p>
<p>無論如何，這影片的作者，對於影片的製作是非常認眞的。雖然因爲故事的平庸，並不能使這影片成爲有價值的作品。</p>
<p>這裏有幾點在演出方面是值得注意的。</p>
<p>一·鑄假錢幣的囚犯越獄，在夜色蒼茫之中，警察搜索囚犯。雖然當時的烟霧彌漫，有如大海中的夜色，而使人不能感覺這是在熱鬧中，可是在畫面上乃是非常美麗的。加之不斷的警鐘聲和三兩聲的犬吠，更是增加了嚴肅的色調。囚犯逃，警察的追捕，糢糊的人影。丨丨我懣這該是最出色的場面。</p>
<p>二·火車出險，熊熊的火光，災難中的人們之痛苦的呼喊。同時又寫出孟羅醫生的殺人，被殺者死前的掙扎。越獄犯在窗口窺探殺人時之恐怖而有膽略的面部特寫。這些，這些，逼成那一緊張的塲面。這畫面間的Ｍontage是很值得注意的。</p>
<p>以上是這一影片最好的成績。</p>
<p>本來每一部作品很難於自首至尾，一貫的都使人稱讚、只要有一部份的優點，便可使作品生色。然而主要的還要整個的部份很好的配襯着，假使僅僅是幾個優點，此外都很貧弱，那末仍不免是失敗的作品，甚至於其特有的成績，也容易被觀衆所漠視。在這裏我們很可以指出最主要的缺點，譬如李加特在俱樂部中的談話，那繁重的對白，莊嚴其事的坐着對談四五分鐘之久，簡直比舞臺劇還要機械。這在非英美的地方開映，對於不能全懂英語的觀衆不啻是在悶熱的天氣中聽講故事，很可以敎人瞌睡。此外，吉勃特出獄後也有那末長的一大段。以對白來說明劇的進展，眞是最笨的辦法。假使以潑布斯特的「伏虎美人」相比，那眞有天壤之别。「伏虎美人」中的對白，眞是簡潔之至。當那女王和軍官下棋時，只有三兩句說白，而那最精采的一塲，使人永遠不會忘懷。誰也知道聲片的特長，决不是將戲劇從舞台移上銀幕。卓别齡在「城市之光」中的配音，有意的將錮像揭幕時的對白配成那種奇怪的聲音，（他對蕭伯納說因爲他的話不能給觀衆聽見。）未嘗不是對白繁雜最有力的反證。</p>
<p>此外在小的地方，如李加特扯地氈而脱逃，顯出作者的小聰明，然而最多是敎觀衆直覺的笑笑而巳。他如最後的危急塲面，讓警察來解圍，眞是再平凡不過了。</p>
<p>平均一般的說，這到底是平凡的演出，不管導演是何等愼重其事，不管幾個主要演員都還可以將就過去，充其量，不過是上了水平綫罷了。</p>
<p>至於故事的結構，我以爲他主要的不通是應當歸罪於小說原著的。我們看無論那一部偵探小說，都是使惡人得着惡報，偵探大顯神通而大快人心的。正因爲他的大快人心，便使偵探小說和現代社會有着密切的聯繫了。</p>
<p>在這裡我們看到所謂惡徒們居然打電話至警署，而呌偵探於某時某地會晤·明明的是敎警察前來拘捕，簡直是愚笨之極，天下有如此怪事嗎？其他還有可笑之處，一時記不起來。</p>
<p>至於說「…吉勃脱之殺人自殺，孟羅之失足貽憂，季加特之懲暴鋤奸，均有發人猛省之妙。實屬警世風，砭時弊，益人心之佳構也。一果如此，則本片的價值自然是了不起！可是我們得了什麽裨益呢？我想觀衆諸君一定不免發笑的吧。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>評「飄零」</h3>
<p>— 淥漪</p>
<p>飄零寫一個不幸的女子到處遭到不幸，像一隻秋天的樹葉一樣東飄西零，終於寂寞地死去。關於這題材，我認爲尚屬可取，只要正確地去處理。但「飄零」的演出却有點使我們失望。從秀貞由鄉間逃出來，就找到了生活，雖其間受到傅仲卿的假辱，但却因此而引起和大學生丁振平同居。這故事的叙述一點不能使觀衆同情這飄零的女子，反而覺得她是幸福了。直到後來病中被房東逐出而死去，這才從觀衆的口中發出一聲嘆息。可見這劇情是不夠感動觀衆的。</p>
<p>但是，我們不能因此而說劇情與社會無關，如兒子死後就想賣媳婦；兒子的死去認爲媳婦命不好；都能從現在的社會裏找出來的。這種惡習還深存在民間。不過大學生丁振平的和秀貞相識，連繫上是很牽强的。</p>
<p>演出上秀貞將死和同學找振平這兩個塲面很緊張，也因了這全劇的高潮而爲「飄零」生色不少。</p>
<p>用花來暗示秀貞的命運，和用打翻魚碗來暗示振平爲父所禁，這兩點是導演的聰明處，但可惜用這種象徵的手法是使大部份觀衆不能懂得的。</p>
<p>攝影的光線大致很好，鏡頭的移動也甚得當，但少了幾個特寫的鏡頭，否則，給觀衆的印象還要深一點。</p>
<p>字幕除了多幾個「第二天」之外，還甚恰當，對話的字幕也尚簡潔。總之，「飄零」在技巧上是較天一其他的片子略有進步了。</p>
<p>演員胡珊·陸麗霞·馬陋芬都能稱職。蕭正中個性不合，馬東武表現過火一點。</p>
<h3>飄零的一個漏洞</h3>
<p>— 耀祖</p>
<p>由胡珊主演的飛絮後部飄零，二十二日已在北京大戲院正式開映了，我去參觀後，發現了一個不小的漏洞，特地寫了出來：</p>
<p>秀貞由鄉下避到上海上薦頭，照例上海薦頭店的規律是：「諸親好友，無保不薦。」的。秀貞同薦頭店老閭，旣不是親，又不是友，只說了聲：「我要託你們薦生意。」（大意如此）薦頭店老閭立刻邀她進去，答應她的要求。我以爲這一點未免太不近事實了。</p>
<p>（我想耀祖君的心太細了，不過這亦是一點小意見，所以給他公布了吧。編者）</p>
<h3>談談「春潮」及「鶴鳴通」</h3>
<p>— 寅仲</p>
<p>喧傳了許久的「春潮」，居然出現在春申浦上了。一般望穿了秋水，等焦了心竅的影迷們，於今遂得一償他們欣賞佳片的願欲了。這在他們是多麽幸福的一回事喲！丨何况又是在這樣清雅宜人的秋天裏呢？</p>
<p>是的，「春潮」是自從聲片潮流衝進我國影壇以來，我國人自造收音機製出聲片的第一聲。這在我國電影史上的確值得大筆特書的一頁。</p>
<p>這片子的故事内容，却是依然不脱那種「香艷」「肉感」「神秘」「浪漫」……的氣味，换言之，又是一張充滿了頽廢的色彩，同時洋溢着感傷情調的片子。固然它是在呌人家認識都市中「布爾喬亞」女性的荒唐淫佚，和意志薄弱的青年之容易被誘惑，以致産生悲慘的後果：丨這種暴露「布爾喬亞」的罪惡的片子，在意識上並非不正確，可是它除了這以外，並没有盡了它别個更重要的任務。像這樣的故事，以前的片子上儘多。而今還要這樣的演出，未免有些令人感到厭倦吧？</p>
<p>話雖如此，但這片之出生，還是「鶴鳴通」收音機的試騐材料，所以這片子的内容，不論如何，都不能成爲問題的吧？至於這件收音機試騐的結果有没有成功呢？</p>
<p>我雖没有看到它的東西怎樣構造，但這張我國自造收音機所製出的第一張聲片「春潮」，我却是去領過敎的。我曾仔細地聽它的發聲，覺得實在是高高低低，太不平匀；有幾個地方，在片子上本是人與人的對白，但透進我們的耳鼓裡的，却並不是人在說話；要是我們把一雙眼睛閉攏了，還會疑心是一對貓兒在鬥嘴呢！其餘不像樣的聲音，我不能詳細寫出了。</p>
<p>「鶴鳴通」顯然還没有成功。但我們旣知道這是第一次的試騐，根據平常的經騐看來，這也是必然的現象；愈是偉大的工程或事業，其失敗更是免不了。因此，我們對於這件首次出世的國産電影收音機，不能拿了過於苛酷的意思去責難它。况且這件收音機的製作者顔鶴鳴君，爲了它，不知耗費了多少的心血和財力。這也夠見出他的苦心孤詣了。</p>

<p>— 幸生</p>
<p>潘弟知道她的姊姊的愛人是賈克白林，但是她没有法子使她的姊姊不答應嫁勞倫斯。她起初是當勞倫斯是天下第一美男子，但是自從他說穿了她的慌話之後，她心裡很恨他。她和賈克白林商量着，要使她姊姊不嫁勞倫斯；可是勞倫斯求婚了，愛琳答應他了。潘弟問賈克道：「到底爲什麽我姊姊要答應他呢」？賈克道：「噯，你不知道。你的父親欠了許多債………」潘弟道：（什麽？因爲勞倫斯有錢，你竊？她出賣自己？這是太豈有此理了！我一定要想法子阻止他們的婚姻。我什麽事情都做得出來。我可以說瞎話，等等一切。」</p>
<p>可是事態變化得太使潘弟難堪了。老大慰已經欠了勞倫斯不少錢了！那些債主巳經是非現錢不給他東西了。賣雪茄的送了些上等的雪茄來；老大尉摸着自己的口袋；旁邊勞倫斯看見了，就拿出幾張鈔票來，代他付了賬。潘弟冷眼看着，想有什麽法子能還掉她父親所欠的錢。有一天，市集的日期到了。她養着有四頭可愛的小猪，想把牝賣了還勞倫斯的錢。可是在市集上，勞倫斯和愛琳亦來了。她四只小猪要賣九鎊錢。勞倫斯還她六鎊半，其實是逗着她玩。可是潘弟生氣了，她說：「你的錢比人家的值錢些嗎」？勞倫斯看見她生氣了，連忙說道：「潘弟，你何必生氣呢，我並不是殺你的價。要是你賣的話，我情願出二十鎊」。潘弟說：「我不希罕你的錢」。她終究照她九鎊的價錢，賣給一位别人了。</p>
<p>那天晚上勞倫斯嚇了一跳，因爲潘弟忽然將賣小猪的九鎊錢還他了。她說：「這是我父親欠你的錢。」勞倫斯正想和她辯論，亞代爾大尉又進來了。他對着勞倫斯道：「好孩子，你身邊有錢没有？四五鎊就夠了。」勞倫斯順手將潘弟還他的九鎊給了他，他就順手給了在門口等着的一位債主。</p>
<p>潘弟看了眼睛裏冒火，盛氣對着她父親道：「爸爸，這算什麽呢？」她父親道：「我買了一匹馬，一時没有錢付他。」潘弟道：「你不是有一匹馬嗎？怎麽又要買馬？」老頭兒笑道：我有一匹馬？我有十匹馬呢！我還有一間藏書樓呢；難道我有藏書樓就不能再買書了嗎？」潘弟聳聳肩胛，摇摇頭，歎着氣走了。她自從受了這次刺激，以爲勞倫斯故意潮笑她，她更加恨勞倫斯。可是她終究没有法子阻當他的娶愛琳爲妻。（未完）</p>

(24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Huang Shaoxiong, Zhao Pilian, and others have been exchanging views with relevant parties on Mongolian affairs and assigning work for the future since arriving in Beiping and have been very busy. To facilitate contact, a Commissioner's Office for Inspection of Inner Mongolia has been specifically established at the Central Hotel, with visiting hours in the morning and office hours in the afternoon. Huang and his party have decided to depart on the 26th. On the morning of the 24th, various Mongolian princes residing in Beiping visited Huang one after another, with Zhao Pilian and Li Songfeng receiving them on his behalf. Huang has scheduled a personal meeting at 9:00 AM on the 25th to inquire about the Mongolian situation and the truth about autonomy. The Mongolian Association and Relief Association of Beiping have jointly convened a meeting of Mongolians to welcome Commissioners Huang and Zhao to show their support for their inspection of Mongolia. Zhangjia also visited Huang, Zhao, and He Yingqin, among others, on the afternoon of the 24th for lengthy talks. Zhangjia's itinerary is still undecided. According to Huang, his party has decided to depart on the morning of the 26th, first to Guihua to meet with Chairman Fu, and then to determine future actions. Whether to enter Mongolia must be determined after arriving in Suiyuan. However, he personally admires visiting Mongolia and speaking with various princes to convey the intentions of the central government. Currently, all travel arrangements have been properly made and will definitely not delay the trip. The central government has made some decisions regarding the policy towards Mongolia, but because it is still in progress, I regret that I cannot inform you. (24th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>(Beiping) A representative of Mongolians residing in Beiping stated that Inner Mongolian autonomy is a need of the Mongolian people and not a request of a small number of people. Rumors that Inner Mongolia is implementing autonomy as a sign of separating from the government are not true. If Inner Mongolia truly wanted to separate from the government, it could proceed with independence, why would it need to request it from the central government? It is hoped that the central government can accommodate the requests of the Mongolian people and seek welfare for the Mongolian people and the entire country. The association of fellow countrymen residing in Beiping has sent representatives with written opinions to visit Huang Shaoxiong and plans to hold a meeting to welcome Huang and present everything in detail and will issue a declaration in the coming days.

The provincial government has decided to adhere to the principle of leniency, and all those who can voluntarily hand over their weapons will be allowed to reform. Currently, the bandits in Funing City are being treated with both suppression and appeasement. A letter of劝告股匪书 (persuasion to bandit gangs) has been specifically issued to allow the people to escape from fire and water as soon as possible. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Changli Chief Li of the military department came to the front line for inspection on the afternoon of the 24th. Zhou's troops are now stationed in Xiaoni. Liu Zuo Zhou's troops arrived at Chengg 각 Zhuang and have not yet advanced. Dou's troops have a strong line of defense along the Yang River. There have been small contacts at the front. If the bandits are unrepentant, all routes will launch a general attack, and it will not be difficult to pacify them. It is reported that the bandits divided up 210,000 yuan of spoils in Funing City on the 22nd. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhao Lei's troops of the Second Brigade of Li Jichun's army are now under orders to block Qi Wenping's troops from fleeing west on the west bank of the Luan River. After Qi's bandits retreated from Funing, they fled towards Taitouying and Xuanweizhai. Japanese troops are stationed at Liushugou and Wangjiagou in Jieling, numbering over 300.

The bandit leader was originally a local bully of Dushan, Mo Laohui, who claimed to be a certain allied army and will pass through Longwangmiao south of Dushan, rush to Jianhanling, and enter Yiyuan Pass to support Lao Haozi and Qi Wenping.

Thousands of bandits have been trapped in the city and can no longer support it and are now preparing to flee. The recovery of Funing County is only a matter of time. The Jie Ling Kou and Shi Men Zhai areas are guarded by Japanese troops. With the bandits facing enemies on both sides, it will not be difficult to eliminate them in one fell swoop. Song said that he is going to Tianjin to take care of personal affairs and plans to return to Beiping within a week and then return to Zhangyuan to take care of provincial government affairs. Huang Shaoxiong's inspection of Inner Mongolia may precede his trip to the north. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>

The Chinese and Japanese authorities are keeping the nature of the talks strictly secret, saying that this is just a visit and did not mention any Sino-Japanese incidents. However, the Chinese authorities have banned newspapers from publishing news of the Japanese ambassador's visit, so the Chinese people suspect that the two leaders exchanged views on Sino-Japanese incidents.

<h3>Zhu Shaoliang and Others Request that Sun's Troops be Transferred Elsewhere; Central Government Orders Sun to Halt Advance and Await Further Orders; Ma Hongbin Returns to Ningxia to Mediate</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Since the issue of Sun Dianying opening up Qinghai arose, the Ningxia Provincial Committee has resigned en masse due to difficult circumstances. Sun's troops have not yet advanced and are waiting for the central government to resolve the issue. The people of Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai provinces have recently requested the military and political leaders of each province to find a way to negotiate, requesting Sun's army to stop advancing westward. Zhu Shaoliang, the pacification director, has joined the governors of Ningxia and Qinghai in jointly telegramming Sun's army to advance, and jointly telegraphed the central government to request the withdrawal of the order and transfer of Sun's army or to find another way. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the issue of Sun's troops advancing westward, the authorities in Beiping hope that Sun will lead his troops to temporarily station in Baotou, Wuyuan, and Linhe because of the severe weather in the northwest, which makes marching difficult.

<h3>Prince De Expresses Reasons for Requesting Autonomy; Leagues and Banners Seek Unity Through Autonomy; Foreign Affairs Still Handled by the Central Government</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Prince De made a statement to a certain gentleman, saying that Mongolian princes had fiefs and stipends during the Qing Dynasty. Mongolian princes only accepted orders from the Qing Emperor. In the early days of the Republic of China, stipends were still paid, but were later interrupted. Not only were stipends not given, but the leagues and banners under their jurisdiction were gradually incorporated into provincial boundaries and county administrations were established. Therefore, the Mongols' demands today are only for self-preservation and autonomy, and there are absolutely no unreasonable demands. Foreign affairs are still handled by the central government, and other internal issues require Mongolian autonomy. If the central government can allow this, the Mongols will have no objection. From his conversation, it can be observed that Prince De has no intention of absolutely betraying China, and other members have even less such intention. According to a certain gentleman's observation, if the government can sincerely enlighten the Mongolian issue, the Mongols will definitely turn inward, granting them freedom and restoring their treatment. The Mongols are naturally honest and simple and will not want to be exploited by foreigners. As for the Panchen Lama and Zhangjia, they only have a considerable effect on the Mongols in the spiritual world and may not have much effect on politics. During the Bailing Temple meeting, the Panchen Lama was stationed not far from Bailing, and the relationship between the Panchen Lama and Prince De was still good. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain gentleman who participated in the Bailing Temple meeting stated that a total of 65 representatives from various leagues and banners attended the Bailing Temple meeting, all of whom were Mongols. Among them, two came from Rehe and were Mongols from the pseudo-organization, which is extremely noteworthy. One of these two is also a high-ranking soldier. It is true that the Bailing Temple meeting was supported by Prince De. The telegrams they sent to the central government requesting autonomy were all made by him outside the Bailing Temple meeting. Although he wanted to give the Bailing Temple meeting a political role, most of the princes of various leagues and banners were waiting to see and did not agree to immediately discuss it, advocating that a decision be made after consulting with the representatives of the central government entering Mongolia. Therefore, all political proposals at the Bailing Temple meeting have been postponed for discussion. Fu Zuoyi had sent someone to advise Prince De not to participate in the Bailing Temple meeting, saying that this meeting had a revolutionary meaning, but Prince De denied it, thinking that there was no intention, only to reorganize the long-divided relationship between the various leagues and banners in Inner Mongolia. During the Bailing Temple meeting, there were only one or two hundred guards and no large army. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain agency received a telegram from Guihua stating that Prince De convened a meeting of various princes in Bailing Temple on the 19th, but it was unsuccessful due to opposition from various princes. The princes have left Bailing Temple one after another. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>President Wang Receives Representatives from Xikang</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) President Wang received Ma Ze Zhao, a representative of the people of Xikang residing in Beijing, and Sun Qinghua, chairman of the Xikang Consolidation and National Defense Support Association, who recently arrived in Beijing from Xikang, on the 24th and inquired about the recent situation in Xikang. Sun detailed the determination of the people of Xikang over the years to support the central government and defend national defense, hoping that the central government would decide on a solution to the Kangzang issue, which is related to national defense, as soon as possible to reassure the border people. Wang replied that the central government is very concerned about the Kangzang issue, and the General Staff Department has drafted a concrete plan, hoping to resolve it as soon as possible to stabilize the border people. He also said that the central government has been considering the issue of establishing a province in Xikang for a long time, but because all construction projects in Xikang are still waiting to be carried out, he is sincerely afraid that once the provincial government is established, the government expenses will be vast, which will increase poverty, so it has not been implemented.

According to Wang Luyi, deputy director of the committee, the plan was proposed by Yang Xiaotian, a member of the Seamen's Union Reorganization Committee, advocating completely breaking the contracting system, and will first be implemented on the seven ships newly purchased by the China Merchants Bureau using the Boxer Indemnity.

He has specifically submitted the plan to the Central Standing Committee for discussion, and it has been approved. In the future, the committee will urge its implementation in accordance with the law, because this is not only for reorganizing the Seamen's Union but also for the national industry, which cannot be ignored.

<h3>Two Inequalities in the World</h3>
<p>— Yuan</p>
<p>The dangerous situation in the world today can be summed up in one sentence: it is caused by two kinds of inequalities. Domestically, it is due to the inequality in the material pleasures and sufferings enjoyed by the people. Internationally, it is due to the inequality in the rights and interests obtained by various countries.</p>
<p>Because the gap between the rich and the poor is too great within countries, economic panic occurs, leading to local unrest. This phenomenon is most evident in the United States. The US government has been painstakingly managing this for a long time, trying to revive the economy, but has not yet grasped a practical solution. Now that its president, Roosevelt, has decided to abandon the policy of currency inflation, first raising prices and then stabilizing the dollar, his policy is not without merit. However, whether it will be effective is not something we can determine today. We believe that Roosevelt recently made a very practical and important statement. If it is fully implemented, it will be more effective than any policy. His words are recorded below:</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 22nd – After receiving an honorary degree from Washington College today, Roosevelt said that some countries have dictators who have formulated their so-called five-year or ten-year plans. But the United States does not have a dictator. I believe we can advance towards our goals without limiting ourselves to a certain period. He also said that the equitable distribution of the wealth of a few among the people can lead the country to safety. The phrase "the equitable distribution of the wealth of a few among the people" might seem like Roosevelt also wants to implement the Soviet Union's communist policies. But in reality, to survive in today's world, no matter what system a country has, it cannot violate this definition. Our ancient people said, "Do not worry about scarcity, but worry about inequality." The intention is the same. The reason why countries around the world are in turmoil today is invariably due to inequality between the rich and the poor. The greater the disparity between the rich and the poor, the more dangerous the country will be. We don't need to cite examples to prove this, as it is self-evident. Therefore, Roosevelt's words are worthy of our attention. If we want to fundamentally save the country, there is no other strategy.</p>
<p>Because of the inequality in the rights and interests enjoyed internationally, international competition occurs, leading to a trend of expanding armaments. The whole world is thus plunged into a state of unease. Today, Germany, due to its struggle for equality, has withdrawn from the League of Nations and broken the world peace of disarmament, creating a situation where things may change at any moment. However, judging from Hitler's speech on rejoining the League of Nations, he is not without the intention of saving peace. However, his equal status must be acknowledged. His speech is summarized below: Reuters, Kelham, 23rd – Hitler said in a speech in front of the Memorial to the War of Liberation that the German people do not seek war. The German people, precisely because they love peace, are willing to fight for a peaceful existence. Our only goal is to live and work in peace, to have work, and to have food to eat. Other countries should not interfere. We can clearly tell the world that if you are willing to have us join various international conferences and alliances, we will obey your orders. But you must first recognize our national status.</p>
<p>Hitler's words are very straightforward. What he calls "national status" is simply equality. If countries in the world without aggressive ambitions each live in peace, enjoy their work, work at what they should work at, and eat what they should eat, then there will be no lack of peace in the world. However, since there are conflicts of rights and interests among countries, ambitious people compete for these rights and interests. There is contention and inequality in the international arena. Because of international inequality, there is a danger of breaking peace, and there is the reality of fighting for peace and causing non-peace. The key to this lies in a slight difference in the mindset of ambitious countries. If ambitious countries in the world can realize that aggression against other countries is ultimately not beneficial to themselves and not beneficial to the world, and change their course to treat people with a spirit of equality, then there will naturally be no worries about peace internationally, and the world will be at peace. Therefore, I make this statement to those who are generally ambitious.</p>
<h3>Hirota Starts to Revamp Diplomacy, Araki Strives to Expand Armaments; All Ambassadors to Europe and the United States to be Transferred; Military Expenditure Demands 600 Million Yen; Sugimura Said to be Appointed Ambassador to China</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Due to various reasons, the Army Ministry's military budget for next year will be extremely large, reportedly amounting to 600,000,000 yen, of which 250,000,000 yen will be used to replenish military equipment and reorganize the army. The reasons for requesting such a large military budget can be listed as follows: (1) The Japanese army bears significant responsibility after signing a treaty with "Manchukuo" last year; (2) The modernization of Soviet Russia's armaments and the increase in their effectiveness pose a major threat to Japan; (3) The Japanese army's responsibility has also increased after withdrawing from the League of Nations; (4) The Japanese army's weapons are far inferior to those of other powerful countries. During the European War, Japan did not participate in large-scale battles, so it had more weaknesses. Furthermore, the replenishment of weapons after the war was restricted. The plan to replenish military equipment at that time can only be implemented this year, but it will not be completed until next year or the year after. Additional funds are still needed to complete it as scheduled.</p>
<p>Last winter, in December, the Japanese Army Ministry issued a statement saying that military expenditure must be increased because Japan needs to increase the number of troops stationed in Manchuria, reorganize the entire Japanese army, increase the army's mechanization and mobility, and reform the current conscription and training systems. Later, Army Minister Araki, in response to questions from members of the Diet, stated that the original plan required 530,000,000 yen, but in order to comply with the government's intentions, the amount had been reduced to 410,000,000 yen, to be allocated from the 1934 and 1935 budgets. In reality, only 120,000,000 yen has been paid from the current budget.</p>
<p>The plan has now begun to be implemented. The Army Ministry's statement only explained the general outline of the plan, without specifying the detailed methods of replenishment and improvement. However, according to private conversations with personnel from the Army Ministry and news published in local newspapers, the details of the reform are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The infantry will still consist of seventeen divisions, with only minor internal changes; (2) The current method of dispatching troops to Manchuria will continue; (3) Two additional independent garrison battalions will be formed to be stationed in Manchuria for a long period, with each battalion consisting of six companies responsible for protecting roads and suppressing bandits. Their organization will be the same as the current garrison battalions. Their main purpose is domestic defense; (4) The strength of the Kwantung Army will be increased from 10,500 to 65,000, consisting of three and a quarter divisions and two independent cavalry brigades from the domestic army. At the same time, the number of soldiers in each division will also be increased; (5) The current eight air force regiments will all be reorganized, increasing from twenty-six squadrons to thirty-five squadrons; (6) Two tank regiments will be formed, one stationed in Kurume and one stationed in Chiba. Each regiment will be divided into three battalions, and each battalion will be divided into three squadrons. Each squadron will have twelve to fifteen tanks, totaling 260 to 270 tanks. In the past, Japan only had one tank squadron. All the required tanks are manufactured in Japan and have now been completed. The personnel are selected from the infantry, and their term of service is two years; (7) A chemical warfare school will be established to study methods of preventing poison gas and methods of using poison gas.

<h3>Japan Revamps Diplomacy by Starting with the Transfer of Ambassadors</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota established the fundamental policy of diplomatic strategy at the last Five-Minister Conference. The so-called implementation of Hirota diplomacy has reached the stage of implementation. Therefore, while revamping the diplomatic policy, ambassadors are also being replaced to create a new atmosphere. For Ambassador Nagaoka to France's request to resign, it is planned to have Ambassador Sato to Belgium succeed him, and to appoint Vice Foreign Minister Arita as Ambassador to Belgium. Also, if Ambassador Debuchi to the United States, who is returning home at the end of the year, requests to resign, it is planned to select Ambassador Nagai to Germany or Ambassador Yoshida to Italy to succeed him. Furthermore, if Ambassador Ariyoshi to China, who is currently holding important talks with Huang Fu in Beiping, returns home in December, it is planned to take this opportunity to appoint Sugimura Yotaro as Ambassador to China. Therefore, personnel changes within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will be realized within December, bringing much vitality to the Ministry. (Dentsu News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The trend of international politics in Europe is centered on Geneva. Japan not only needs to pay attention to Geneva in relation to the League of Nations, but also as the center of international politics. Foreign Minister Hirota has established a policy of strengthening Japan's diplomatic organization in Geneva. However, due to budget constraints, fundamental measures cannot be taken. It is planned to change the current official system of the Japanese League of Nations Affairs Bureau, renaming it the International Conference Affairs Bureau. Minister Sawada Setsuzo will remain as the director, and Counselor Yokoyama Masakusa of the current Embassy in Belgium will be transferred to become Consul-General in Geneva, concurrently holding the position. This is expected to be realized next spring. (Dentsu News Agency, 24th)</p>
<h3>Debuchi Summoned Back Home</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Debuchi, received an order from the Foreign Ministry today to return home and report on the state of Japan-U.S. relations. It is widely expected that Ambassador Debuchi will not return to his post after returning home. His family will take a ship from San Francisco back to Japan in early November. According to Debuchi, he plans to return home on the same ship as his family. After arriving in Japan, he may reside there permanently, or it is also possible that he will not. (United Press, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Ambassador Debuchi to the United States had intended to return home and resign. Also, with the diplomatic crisis of 1935 imminent, a new strategy for diplomacy with the United States has been decided by the Five-Minister Conference. In order to discuss matters with the Foreign Minister, he plans to return home. He telegraphed Foreign Minister Hirota yesterday for instructions. The Foreign Minister has issued a telegram granting permission. The timing of Ambassador Debuchi's return will be decided after observing the developments after Litvinov's visit to the United States. He will depart Washington in late November. However, it is almost certain that Ambassador Debuchi will submit his resignation after returning home, citing the reason of yielding to a more capable person. Nagai Matsuzo, the Ambassador to Germany, is the most suitable candidate for his successor. However, from the perspective of the importance of diplomacy with the United States, Saito Hiroshi, the Minister to the Netherlands, is also very promising. In other respects, there is also talk of Matsuoka Yosuke succeeding him. Which person Foreign Minister Hirota ultimately chooses to represent the direction of diplomacy with the United States is highly noteworthy. (Dentsu News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Since the Japanese government decided to recall Ambassador Debuchi to the United States, it is now planning a large-scale reshuffle of various ambassadors abroad. According to reliable sources, Ambassador Sato to Belgium will be transferred to become Ambassador to France, succeeding Nagaoka. Arita, the former Vice Foreign Minister, will fill Sato's vacancy. As for Debuchi's successor after returning to Japan, Nagai, the Ambassador to Germany, and Matsukata, the Ambassador to the United Kingdom, are the most promising. Among the two, Nagai is said to have the highest chance. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Based on the fundamental policy of diplomacy decided by the Five-Minister Conference, the foreign, army, and navy authorities are coordinating urgently to draft a diplomatic strategy proposal. After its completion, Foreign Minister Hirota will telegraph the ambassadors abroad, thoroughly conveying the government's intention to properly handle the diplomatic crisis. At the same time, the communication between the ambassadors abroad and the Ministry will be closer than ever before regarding situation reports and other matters. The Foreign Minister will order Ambassador Ariyoshi to return home after he has completed his important tasks in North China. After directly listening to the Ambassador's report on the recent situation in China, he will personally instruct him on the countermeasures. (Dentsu News Agency, 24th)</p>
<h3>Araki Actively Engaging, Conferring with Army and Navy Leaders, Striving to Realize Militarism</h3>
<p>Fukui Army Minister Araki, who is in Fukui to observe the grand military exercise, visited Military Councilor General Masaki last night at 7:30 to report on the proceedings and results of the Five-Minister Conference after the previous meeting of military councilors, and exchanged views on concrete plans for national defense and diplomacy based on the Five-Minister Conference. At that time, Army Minister Araki stated his determination, saying that depending on the content of the concrete plan, the Five-Minister Conference may become meaningless. Therefore, he is determined to continue his efforts in the future. General Masaki also encouraged the Army Minister and vowed to assist him. The meeting ended at 9:00. Army Minister Araki then visited Naval Admiral Kato Kanji, also a military councilor, to hold an important conference on army-navy cooperation in view of the current emergency situation. He left at 10:30. Army Minister Araki also met with General Matsui Iwane, the commander of the Taiwan Army, at the Army Minister's lodging this morning at 10:00 to report on everything, the same as his report to General Masaki, and had a frank discussion. This move is a prelude to actively working on producing concrete plans after the grand military exercise is over, so it is quite noteworthy. (Dentsu News Agency, 24th)</p>
<h3>Japan to Issue New Public Bonds</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Of the new public bonds scheduled to be issued this year, in addition to the previously issued 4% interest 300 million yen bonds, there are still about 700 million yen worth of bonds that have not been issued. Therefore, the government will issue the second batch of public bonds within November. The issuance terms are as follows, which are slightly the same as the last time: (1) The issuance amount is approximately 300 million yen; (2) The Bank of Japan's acceptance amount is approximately 200 million yen; (3) The Deposit Bureau's acceptance amount is approximately 100 million yen; (4) The issuance price is 98.5 yen per 100 yen face value; (5) The repayment period is 25 years.

<h3>French Left-Wing Cabinet Overthrown After Only Nine Months in Power; Finance Bill Attacked by Both Left and Right; Parliament Ultimately Rejects with Majority Vote; President Calls Leaders of All Parties to Resolve Political Crisis; Radical Party Still to be Center of New Cabinet</h3>
<p>(Paris) The French cabinet has resigned en masse after its budget proposals failed in the National Assembly's Chamber of Deputies this morning. (National Telegraph, 24th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Yesterday, the Chamber of Deputies discussed the financial reorganization bill throughout the morning and afternoon. The government's financial bill was ultimately rejected by a majority vote of 329 to 241. The government's financial reorganization bill included a clause stipulating that salaries of fixed nature for personnel in public and private institutions should be taxed at 6%. The Socialist Party opposed this clause, while the Radical Party hoped to adopt a compromise. Representatives of the two parties held a joint meeting to seek a compromise. A minority within the Socialist Party, such as Leroultel and Malgaix, advocated supporting the current government, but the majority did not approve and said that the opinions of leaders of various professional organizations should first be sought on the matter of taxing salaries. These organizations did not approve of taxing salaries either. Therefore, discussion of this matter in the Chamber of Deputies was quite difficult. The left-wing majority party in the Chamber of Deputies that supported the government was composed of the Radical Party and the Socialist Party. Now that the Socialist Party could not agree with the government, the cabinet could not avoid being overthrown. (Havas News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Members of Parliament do not consider the overthrow of the cabinet to be strange and generally recognize this matter as a natural result of internal disagreement within the Socialist Party. The Socialist Party has never been able to unify its opinions regarding participating in the government. As for the central and right-wing parties, although they advocated austerity policies, they felt that the government's financial plan was too tainted with socialism. Therefore, the current overthrow of the government was in fact attacked by several factions from the left and right. As for the trend of the next cabinet, it is too early to say. Will the Radical Party unite with some members of the right-wing to form a majority party? Or will it unite with a minority of the Socialist Party and some votes from the central faction to form a majority party? It is not possible to predict at this time. In the lounge of the Chamber of Deputies, there are already people speculating on candidates for future Prime Minister, such as Sea Minister Sarraut, Interior Minister Chautemps, Finance Minister Bonnet, and Education Minister Termonier. They are all considered to have hopes of forming a cabinet, but before the President seeks opinions from all sides, it is difficult to determine. Starting today, the President has begun seeking opinions from all parties in order to appoint a new Prime Minister to form a new cabinet. (Havas News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>It is noted that the Radical Socialist Party initially formed a cabinet under Herriot in the current Parliament. However, he resigned due to disagreement with the Chamber of Deputies over the issue of repaying the American war debt. Then, Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour succeeded him in forming a cabinet, which was overthrown after only about a month. The Daladier cabinet has been in office for only nine months since taking office.</p>
<h3>Daladier Proposes Finance Bill; Heated Debate Erupts</h3>
<p>(Paris) The failure of the current cabinet came after the most intense debate seen in many years. At that time, the entrances to the venue were surrounded by troops to prevent taxpayers from rushing in to demonstrate. The seriousness of the situation was also rare in peacetime.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Daladier, during the final stages of the debate, loudly declared, "We hereby challenge the Parliament to give a complete and definitive judgment on the government's financial policy. If you overthrow this government, do not expect the new government to have a better solution." The current government's policy firmly opposes using currency inflation plans to deal with the difficulty of a huge budget deficit. This deficit is close to 48 million pounds in British currency. Therefore, from the day it was announced, it was expected that the current government would be difficult to maintain.</p>
<p>However, at this time, both sides of the verbal battle were exhausted. Daladier began defending the government's budget after midnight, and by this time he was hoarse, and the members were also nervous and no longer able to pay close attention.</p>
<h3>Armed Guards Around Parliament to Prevent Taxpayer Riots</h3>
<p>At that time, large numbers of police guarded around the Parliament and nearby streets. The Boulevard Saint-Germain was even stationed with more than 2,500 Republican Guards, blocking traffic. Steel helmets and bayonets were everywhere, making it extremely grim. Special reserve forces were secretly guarding in the small alleys near the Parliament to prevent angry taxpayers from rushing into the Parliament. It is said that more than 100 suspected criminals were arrested in one day and night, all suspected of leading taxpayers in an attempt to demonstrate.</p>
<h3>New Socialist Party Suddenly Breaks Away and Votes No Confidence in the Government</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the session, Daladier calmly detailed the government's plan to make up for the huge deficit, part of which involved drastically reducing government spending and laying off redundant staff to conserve funds. After the Prime Minister's speech, the members began to discuss it. Initially, it was intended that the New Socialist Party would support the government, but the result was that only about 30 people supported it.</p>
<p>As the discussion reached Article 37, which stipulated that the amount of salary reduction for civil servants under the government should be changed from 3% to 9%, the opposition immediately proposed a motion of no confidence in the government. When the vote was taken, only 30 members of the New Socialist Party trusted the government, 10 abandoned the right to vote, and the rest all changed to no confidence in the government. According to an informal count of the results of the vote, there were 300 votes against the government's original proposal, and only 240 in favor. At this time, the whole arena was in chaos. Later, there was another formal recount, which showed 329 votes against the government and 241 votes in favor of the government.</p>
<h3>Sarraut and Chautemps Are Most Often Mentioned as Possible Successors</h3>
<p>Therefore, the government immediately announced its resignation, and the cabinet members all left the meeting one after another. It was later announced that they would meet with the President at 3:30 in the afternoon to formally submit their resignations.</p>
<p>According to current discussions, it seems that a coalition cabinet will be formed, and either Sarraut, the former Minister of Colonies from the left wing of the Democratic Party, or Chautemps, the former Minister of the Interior from the Radical Socialist Party, will be the Prime Minister. (National Telegraph, 24th)</p>
<h3>President Urgently Seeks to Resolve Political Crisis, Urging All Parties to Eliminate Partisan Differences</h3>
<p>(Paris) With the fall of the Daladier cabinet, the most difficult task in France today is to obtain a government that can save the falling franc. The whole country is now looking to Radical Party leaders Chautemps and Caillaux, as the best opportunity to save the country lies in their eliminating partisan differences in order to preserve the stability of the franc. After the Daladier cabinet collapsed, the franc weakened immediately. The opening price this morning was 83.20 francs per British pound, compared to yesterday's price of 82.12. It is believed that the Bank of France is currently attempting to maintain the price of the franc. President Lebrun met with the resigning cabinet members early this morning, and then began consultations at 9:00. The first to meet with the President was Néraud, the President of the Senate. It is said that the most important task today is to defend the franc and the French land. Following him, the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Bouisson, and Caillaux, etc., entered to meet with him. The demonstrators arrested yesterday have all been released from the police station today. The private cars used to block the roads have also been returned to their owners. However, many streetcar drivers are still in custody. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<h3>Daladier to Remain Foreign Minister, Following Status Quo in Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>(Paris) Sarraut, Chautemps from the Radical Party, and Caillaux, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, are the most likely to succeed as Prime Minister. The new government's foreign policy will follow the status quo without much change. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Sarraut is currently the most likely to succeed as Prime Minister. It is said that he will recruit members of the Taittinger faction and the Socialist Party to form a coalition cabinet, and the post of Foreign Minister will be given to Daladier. (National Telegraph, 24th)</p>
<h3>Cabinet Crisis Triggers Financial Crisis, Franc Likely to Change</h3>
<p>(Paris) The failure of the government will trigger a serious crisis, as the franc is likely to change, and Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations has created a tense international situation. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<h3>Small Victory Before Major Defeat, Passing 21 Articles; Securities to Apply to Pre-Assessment Method</h3>
<p>(Paris) This afternoon, the Chamber of Deputies continued to discuss the finance bill and passed Article 21 of the finance bill by a show of hands. This article stipulates that the pre-assessment method will be applied to all securities other than national securities. The discussion on Article 20 regarding proof procedures was easily passed. When discussing Article 21, many amendments were proposed. The right-wing accused the pre-assessment method, saying, "Securities have already paid income tax and transfer tax, and now they are subject to pre-assessment, which is tantamount to imposing three layers of tax. The government originally intended to prevent tax evasion, but honest taxpayers are affected." Former Finance Minister Drastel said that it was feared that it would lead to higher capital interest and the establishment of new officials. However, Piétri supported the pre-assessment method, saying that it was a preventive method rather than a punitive method. One of the right-wing leaders, Marran, asked whether the interest issued by savings banks would also use the pre-assessment method. After Prime Minister Daladier gave a negative reply, Article 21 was passed. (Havas News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<h3>British Cabinet Advocates Extending Disarmament Conference; Small Countries Agree, US Representative Opposes; Key Committee Reopens Today; British Under-Secretary Eden Attends in Place of Simon</h3>
<p>(London) The British Cabinet held a special meeting this afternoon, lasting one hour and forty-five minutes, discussing the international situation after Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations and disarmament, as well as the results of the exchange of views among various countries on this matter. According to a Reuters reporter, the Cabinet has decided that Foreign Secretary Simon will temporarily not return to Geneva, and Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Eden will go in his place. Eden will go to Geneva yesterday morning (Tuesday) to attend the key committee meeting of the Disarmament Conference to be held on Wednesday. People in London believe that the international situation is extremely difficult to grasp, so the British Cabinet has not been able to reach a definitive resolution, especially as the situation in the French Parliament and the negotiations between France, Germany, and Italy are still in progress, and it is still difficult to immediately decide on the steps to take. It is widely believed that the British Cabinet supports a short-term extension of the Disarmament Conference. At the same time, according to news from Geneva, people in the League of Nations also agree with this idea, as they have the same understanding. It is expected that the adjournment of the Disarmament Conference will be extended until after the German general election on November 12th, with an extension of about two or three months. During the adjournment, the major powers can conduct separate negotiations with Germany to enable Germany to rejoin the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference. At the same time, a drafting committee will be selected to prepare to revise the previous British disarmament plan based on various proposals and amendments. (Reuters dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) After the British Cabinet meeting yesterday decided to support the extension of the meeting of the Disarmament Conference Presidium and the General Committee, Switzerland, Austria, Hungary, Finland, and other countries expressed their support for this British decision. However, the United States clearly expressed its opposition, especially the US representative Davis. Davis negotiated with the Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, Henderson, in the morning, informing him of his feelings. Davis seems to have prepared everything to allow the Disarmament Conference to continue its work, and the meeting must continue in any way. (Havas dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<h3>MacDonald's Speech: Willing to Continue Efforts for Disarmament; Hopes Germany Will Return to Cooperation</h3>
<p>(London) British Prime Minister MacDonald said in a speech in Crawley today that the British government does not want to abandon its efforts to seek an agreed disarmament plan. Britain has nothing to be ashamed of or apologize for to Germany. Countries around the world must develop a spirit of good neighborliness. If countries cannot sit at the table on an equal footing, then there can be no solution in Europe. Germany must make other countries able to be near it without fear or suspicion. Britain will adopt the plan that it believes will achieve the best results, and of course, one of its methods will not be to escape. He does not believe that Germany's behavior, allowing other countries in the world to deal with their difficulties alone, is a way to create peace and trust in Europe. He hopes that Germany will seize the opportunity to show its pursuit of peace and its eagerness to cooperate again with other countries that do not want it to sacrifice its honor or self-esteem. (Reuters dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>France's Stance Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>(Paris) Foreign Minister Poncet received representatives of the press and issued a statement saying that the current cabinet reshuffle will absolutely not change France's position at the Disarmament Conference. Paris believes that the Disarmament Conference should continue its work. Geneva may decide to extend the Disarmament Conference. Although France does not oppose this, Paris hopes that the extension will be limited and not indefinitely delayed. France supports both of the following two methods: one is the proposal put forward by the United Kingdom, advocating postponing the meeting to wait for the results of the German referendum on November 12; the other is the proposal of Switzerland, setting December 1 as the date for the reopening of the Disarmament Conference. (Havas dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Plenipotentiary for Disarmament Prepares to Return Home</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) After Germany withdrew from the League of Nations, the Japanese military had no expectations for the Disarmament Conference. It was originally planned to propose a proposal to suspend the Disarmament Conference, but fearing that the world would misunderstand that Japan alone was unwilling to reduce its military, the military's attitude has changed to be passive, waiting for other countries to propose an adjournment proposal, and Japan will then advocate support. It is heard that the military has ordered the plenipotentiary for disarmament to pack up and return home. Lieutenant General Mori will go to France to serve as a military attache, and Lieutenant General Hasegawa will return home directly. (Hualian dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<h3>German Election Campaign; Slogans Posted All Over the Streets; Extensive Recruitment of Stormtroopers</h3>
<p>(Berlin) When Germany holds its first unilateral general election, the authorities will submit a list of candidates from the National Socialist Party, headed by Hitler and ten others. German Chancellor Hitler and Propaganda Minister Goebbels have formulated new election slogans. Slogans of "Seeking Peace and Equality of Rights" are now posted on all major streets throughout the country. The authorities are sparing no effort in campaigning, aiming to seek the greatest trust of the people in the National Socialist Party government on this non-partisan issue, so that the country will vote in favor of Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations. The stormtrooper office of the National Socialist Party, which has been closed for more than a month, announced today that it will reopen and recruit new members from November 1st to November 5th. The reason for this has not been explained, but it is probably related to the general election on November 12th. There are important changes in the wording of the questions on the ballot paper. The text reads: "Do you, German men and women, support the policies of your government? Are you prepared to recognize this as an expression of your own views and your own aspirations? Do you solemnly promise to uphold it?" There is no doubt that this type of ballot paper will later be used to support the Hitler government without saying a word. (Reuters dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Austrian Social Democrats Active; Swastika Flags Flying Everywhere; Anti-Government Leaflets Scattered in the Sky</h3>
<p>Vienna Since Germany withdrew from the League of Nations, members of the National Socialist Party have become bolder and engaged in propaganda, even though the authorities have severely punished them. Swastika flags have recently been flying frequently on public buildings, and large swastikas have been erected on the mountainsides, doused with oil and burned, making them visible from several miles away. In Salzburg, countless small balloons were recently released into the sky. Once the balloons exploded, anti-government leaflets fell one after another. Those who support the government also took various retaliatory actions. For example, in Floridsdorf, Styria, members of the National Socialist Party were forced to tie ropes around their waists and pull down the swastikas embedded in the mountain rocks by their comrades. Several well-known National Socialist Party lawyers were also forced to wash away the large swastikas painted opposite the train station. (Reuters dispatch on the 23rd)</p>

<h3>Deteriorating Relations Between Japan and Russia; Troops Sent to Defend Both the Russian and Manchukuo Borders; War is Imminent; Japan-Manchukuo Air Routes Scheduled to Begin Flying on the First of Next Month</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Relations between Japan and Russia have deteriorated daily in recent weeks. The Russian side has sent heavy troops to the Russian-Manchukuo border, and war is imminent. According to news from Northeast China, on the 3rd of this month, a part of the 6th Division of the Japanese Army stationed in Chaoyang, about 1,340 people, set off eastward. The Japanese military transport passing through Jinzhou is also very busy. It is heard that they are all going to the border area of Heilongjiang Province to defend against Russia. In addition, since the construction of the military port in Vladivostok, the Russians have stipulated that foreign ships entering the port must be guided by Russian ships to prevent the leakage of secrets, otherwise they will not be allowed to enter the port freely. The Japanese side has protested and requested an exception for Japanese ships, but the Russian side has not allowed it. Also, in order to develop Japan-Manchukuo night aviation, the Japanese plan to temporarily divide it into two routes: one from Tokyo to Dalian, about 20 hours, and one from Tokyo to Korea, about 5 hours, and it is scheduled to start flying on November 1st.

<h3>War Rumors Between Japan and Russia Panic the People of the Puppet Capital; Large Numbers of Japanese Troops Deployed to the Border; Police Department Claims it is Newspaper Fabrication</h3>
<p>(Changchun) According to Xu, the puppet police chief, anyone who spreads rumors that Japan and Russia are about to declare war will be severely punished, as such rumors are enough to disrupt the security of the puppet capital. The news that the Soviet Union has added armaments on the Asian border and that the Japanese army has been dispatched to suppress bandits in Manchukuo is all a fabrication of the newspapers. Currently, the police are trying their best to appease the people, saying that such rumors are completely unreliable and that the situation is not serious. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<h3>New US Monetary Policy; White House Plans Implementation Methods; Will Begin Buying Mined Gold to Increase World Gold Prices</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt met with financial experts Jones, Acheson, and Morgenthau today to discuss methods for immediately implementing President Roosevelt's new monetary policy. (Reuters dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to reliable sources, the US government will soon begin buying newly mined gold (as President Roosevelt foreshadowed on Saturday night), and the price may be slightly higher than the London and Paris markets. Officials believe that the impact of this move will allow the US dollar to be independent of European forces. The first result will be that the US dollar will be cheaper compared to British and French currencies, and the second will be to increase world gold prices, because the 25,000 to 30,000 ounces of gold exported by the United States every week will remain in the United States in the future and will not leave the country. (Reuters dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Differing Interpretations of Future Impact</h3>
<p>(Washington) There are differing interpretations of the impact of the US President's monetary plan on general commerce. A few market merchants and two or three financial experts believe that this plan has the possibility of indirectly inflating the currency, but most opinions seem to think that the US government will use various other methods to raise prices. Only as a last resort would they want to reduce the value of the gold dollar. However, financiers in important positions generally refrain from commenting for the time being, awaiting the first gold purchase price of the Financial Reconstruction Corporation. Many people now believe that after the Financial Reconstruction Corporation begins purchasing, it will no longer allow gold to be transported to foreign free markets, because foreign free markets are completely speculative. Therefore, if the President wants to control the gold dollar as he said, he must again prohibit gold from leaving the country. According to official sources, the President believes that if he wants to stabilize the gold dollar to reach a basis that can guarantee that creditors will obtain gold dollars with the same purchasing power in the future, it will take one to three years. During this period, the relationship between gold dollars and goods must be manipulated manually. Today, some legal experts doubt whether the President has the right to purchase gold at a value that does not conform to the Gold Standard Act of 1900, believing that there is no precedent for the measures ordered this time. Many bankers also have the same opinion, but economists interpret this procedure as arising from the desire to control the gold dollar price in the international exchange market. Many bankers have told the President that their resumption of gold purchases is a smart move and will greatly stabilize the gold dollar trend. However, other bankers hold the opposite view. At this time, it seems that everyone wants to observe the first action of the Financial Reconstruction Corporation before making a detailed comment on the President's speech.

<h3>Japanese Inventor Develops Bulletproof Glass; Unbreakable When Fired Upon by a Pistol at a Distance of Fifteen Meters</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Tokyo Glass Company recently invented a type of bulletproof glass. The trial was held in Lushun recently, and the results were quite satisfactory. When firing at the glass with a pistol at a distance of fifteen meters, it did not break. There were only black marks around the point where the bullet hit. It is heard that when tested with machine guns and rifles in Tokyo, the results were the same. The company will start manufacturing soon to facilitate purchases by the army, navy, and police authorities. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<h3>Gold Standard: Abandon the Old and Adopt the New</h3>
<p>(Washington) Large bank representatives and currency experts currently in Washington now believe that the old gold standard will soon be abolished and replaced by a new system, so that the United States can more easily manage its metal standard. As for the government's new monetary policy, it is obviously intended to facilitate international trade and restrict the activities of hoarders and exchange speculators. A financier said that the system of allowing holders of gold notes to exchange them for gold coins has become a thing of the past, because the danger of this system was clearly demonstrated during the bank panic in March. The government is still making every effort to recover gold certificates to the national treasury, which is also evidence of this. It is expected that the new gold standard will be used exclusively for the repayment of national debt. At that time, real gold coins will no longer be available, and even the gold bars held by speculators will be few and far between. As for the Financial Reconstruction Corporation soon starting to purchase newly produced gold, it is no different from indicating that the government will absorb all the gold produced domestically in the future. It will only sell it abroad after it is sufficient for domestic currency. Therefore, bankers believe that this entire plan will have a tendency to increase the use of silver, because gold coins and gold certificates have completely disappeared from the market, and the government will inevitably mint more silver coins for circulation.

<h3>Major Blow to Japanese Exports to the United States</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese economic world has been greatly affected by the United States' increase in the price of buying gold bullion. Japanese financial circles observe that the exchange rate with the United States will rise again, and Japanese goods shipped to the United States will inevitably be affected, especially raw silk. According to Governor Tutakata of the Bank of Japan, President Roosevelt's speech on the 22nd of this month did not determine that the United States would reduce the price of currency. Originally, the head of a country cannot lightly predict such a problem. The United States is now increasing the market price in the London and Paris markets to buy gold bullion, and its purpose is to raise domestic prices. Because the price policy implemented after the ban on gold exports cannot be said to be successful. Farmers all over the United States have already started a crop cessation movement, and the domestic economy is even more difficult. Therefore, they have to take control of the gold dollar policy. After the United States implements this policy, the gold standard countries in Europe, France, and the Netherlands will inevitably be greatly affected, and Japanese goods shipped to the United States will of course be somewhat affected. They will also have to change the existing policy of buying gold. (Hualian dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<h3>Violent Reactions in Domestic Markets</h3>
<p>(Washington) After President Roosevelt delivered his speech yesterday, violent reactions occurred in the market today. On Wall Street, the market prices of various raw materials have risen. The price of wheat in Chicago has risen by 19 points compared to last week. Cotton futures in New Orleans have risen by 6 to 11 points. Cotton prices in New York have risen by 22 to 24 points. When the stock exchange opened, all kinds of stocks rose across the board, with some rising by as much as five dollars. The rate of increase in various gold certificates was particularly high, but afterwards it gradually weakened. (Havas dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Serious Situation in Siam; Royal Authority Approaching its End; Finances on the Verge of Collapse; Rumors that the Siamese King Has Taken Refuge in Songkhla</h3>
<p>Kuala Lumpur Siam is currently facing one of the most serious situations in modern history, which may lead to financial collapse and the overthrow of the dynasty. A telegram has been received here today confirming that the Siamese King and Queen are currently residing in Songkhla, near the Malaysian border, preparing to flee to neighboring countries. It is heard that the Siamese King and Queen fled from the Hua Hin Palace to Songkhla by plane. However, due to strict inspections and postal and telecommunications censorship in Siam, news is scarce. It is only confirmed that its monarchical system has reached the end of its days. The current situation is more dangerous than the bloodless revolution of June 24 last year, which overthrew the autocratic regime. In addition, it is heard that rebel leader Prince Boworadet has retreated into the mountains northeast of Bangkok. (Guomin dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<h3>Fifth Day of Higher Education Entrance Examination; Questions on Chinese and Foreign History and Geography</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The second Higher Education Entrance Examination continued on the 24th for the fifth day. The qualifying examinations for six categories of examinees, including financial administrators, educational administrators, accountants, statisticians, diplomats, consuls, and judicial officers, were held. In the morning, Chinese and foreign history were tested, and in the afternoon, Chinese and foreign geography were tested. History questions: (1) Since the Qin and Han dynasties, the history books have been filled with bandits and rebels such as the Red Eyebrows, Yellow Turbans, and bandit teachers. However, before the Qin dynasty, there were few bandit disasters. What is the reason for this? Please give the causes of bandit disasters in various dynasties, infer from ancient history, and give a comprehensive and thoughtful answer. (2) The Qing dynasty respected Tibetan Buddhism, which had a great influence on the northwestern frontier. Please state its brief history and infer from it. (3) Ji Ran's discussion on leveling prices and Li Li's maximizing the use of land can both be used to examine the state of the rural economy during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. Please state their theories and discuss the relationship between tax-paying merchants and rural villages. Chinese and foreign history questions: (1) During the Spring and Autumn period, many of Zheng's senior officials were good at diplomacy, and even merchants were able to know the enemy's situation and defend the country's rights. Please discuss their most outstanding deeds in terms of topography. (2) When did direct transportation between Europe and China begin? What were the reasons for this? Where did the Han state built by the Yuan dynasty reach in Europe? What were the effects of this? Please elaborate. (3) Briefly describe the foreign invasions suffered by China and the major trends in world changes from the Qing Guangxu Jiawu year (1894 AD) to the present. Chinese geography questions: (1) The Premier's industrial plan takes the northern port as the starting point, and its main purpose is to develop a world port near the Luan River Estuary, build a railway along the Luan River Valley, and build a metropolis for reclamation in Duolun in the upper reaches of the Luan River. All the plans are carefully considered. After the Battle of the Great Wall, reciting the posthumous works is so painful. Please explain the first plan in the industrial plan in concrete terms with geographical facts. (2) Some raw materials in modern industry are all produced in tropical regions. Hainan Island is my country's only large island and is completely located in the tropical region. Looking around, we are surrounded by strong neighbors. Every time I think of Taiwan, I can't help but worry. If we want to actively operate it as a screen for the South China Sea, where should we start? Can you explain in detail the relationship between people and place? (3) China's water conservancy is most important in the four rivers of the Yangtze, Huai, Yellow, and Hun (Yongding River). China's floods are also the largest in the four river basins. If you want to talk about the ways to control the rivers, you must understand the reasons for the formation of the rivers, and plan the methods of adapting to local conditions, and each has its own special plan. Please describe their outlines separately. Chinese and foreign geography questions: (1) Southeastern China feels that there is too much population. The areas for emigration can be divided into two types: borderlands and overseas. Judging from the current domestic situation, is it easy to emigrate to the borderlands? Also, judging from the foreign situation, are there any areas that can be emigrated to? Please discuss in detail the geographical situation of each area. (2) Discuss the geographical relationship between China and Japan, and draw a sketch to show it. (3) What are the more important of China's export goods? Please briefly describe their sales in the international market. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<h3>Xu Bandits Attempt to Advance Eastward</h3>
<p>(Hankou) Xu Xiangqian's communist bandits, who are entrenched in Sichuan, have already occupied a dozen counties in the northwest of the Qu River. On the 20th, they occupied Sanhui, an important place along the Qu River. Their strength is claimed to be 110,000. Now, with the force of a broken bamboo, they will advance eastward from the Qu River. The southeast of the Qu River is now in a state of emergency. Residents continue to flee to Fuling, Changshou, and Chongqing. Wang Lingji, the division commander of the 3rd Division of Liu Xiang's 21st Army, led a large army out of Dazhu to prevent the communist army from advancing eastward in two routes. The forces of He Long, who advanced from Liqi in Hubei to the south bank of the Yangtze River, remotely echoed Xu Xiangqian's army. Moreover, the Sichuan local defense forces mostly hate the warlords, and most of them are reactionary and have joined the communist army. The situation in Sichuan is becoming more and more critical. If Xu Xiangqian's army crosses the Qu River, then one-third of Sichuan will completely belong to the communist army, and they will hold the throat of Sichuan with the Yangtze River.

However, it is heard that the distribution of relief funds is 200,000 for the three counties of Hebei, 470,000 for the eleven counties of Henan, and only 550,000 for the twenty-one counties of Shandong. If this is true, it seems to be biased. The disaster area in Shandong is wider than in Henan, and the disaster situation is more serious than in Hebei. I hope you will investigate the disaster situation in detail and increase the disaster relief funds for Shandong to show fairness and benefit the relief work. I am deeply grateful." (Zhongyangshe dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<h3>The Suppression of Bandits in Jiangxi is Nearing Total Preparation; Numerous Airplanes Will be Utilized</h3>
<p>(Nanchang) The government army's preparations for a general offensive against the Red bandits are complete. Fortified positions around villages, towns, and bridges have been constructed. The National Army is currently concentrated along the Lichuan-Ji'an line, awaiting orders for a general assault. However, this offensive will be primarily in mountainous terrain, and the caves are filled with machine gun nests belonging to the communist bandits, making reconnaissance difficult. Therefore, in the initial stages of the offensive, the National Army may suffer considerable casualties, as they must take the offensive to break through the communist bandit defenses. Currently, the National Army in Jiangxi has fifty to one hundred aircraft. If these are used to bombard the communist bandits, it is likely to be completely successful. These planes are the latest American and Italian fighters, and each pilot has more than one year of flying experience, thus victory is assured. (Reuters, 24th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Puppets Universally Establish Opium Monopoly Organizations - The Poisonous Atmosphere Under So-Called Kingly Way Politics - Actually Encourage the Public to Smoke, Claiming it is Not Illegal</h3>
<p>Jilin Correspondence: Japanese puppets have universally established opium monopoly organizations in various parts of Northeast China, heavily taxing and addicting young people, creating a dark hell. Fearing that private sales and smoking would make heavy taxes inconvenient to collect, they specifically ordered the establishment of specialized opium sales offices in various places, so as to exploit them to the fullest extent. The following is a copy of the "Jilin Opium Monopoly Industry Notice," the original text of which is as follows: "The government has long announced and publicly promulgated the government's monopoly on gum opium, and the provincial government has designated separate areas for retail distribution. The retail outlets for crude opium and gum opium in Jilin City have been open for some time, but sales have been declining day by day. After investigating the reasons, they are nothing more than private sales and clandestine smoking. Therefore, rumors have been deliberately fabricated to deceive the public, falsely claiming that the soil quality is poor, that the official opium contains medicinal ingredients, and that smoking it for a long time will cause illness. These rumors are shocking. Investigations have revealed that the crude opium and gum opium sold at retail are all obtained from the official authorities and have been repeatedly identified as being purely superior substances with no harmful drugs. If you don't believe it, please buy a small amount to test it and determine the truth, so as not to be misled by rumors. If you would like to patronize us, we guarantee its use. Anyone wishing to buy crude opium, gum opium, or smoking paraphernalia may contact the following companies. No matter how much or how little, you can buy as you wish. This is a government-licensed public business. Eastern and Western opium have official prices, the material is excellent, especially fair, and does not deceive anyone. Purchasers of opium have a sale certificate, and smokers have a free smoking certificate. If you encounter a customs officer checking, you can present it as proof. It is neither illegal nor dangerous. In addition, if you are still confused and buy and smoke privately, it is prohibited. Once discovered or reported by the government, you will be severely punished. If you have not yet obtained a smoking certificate and want to obtain protection and convenience, please go directly to the police station in each district or to the retail outlets, where you can obtain one at any time. There will be no extortion. For fear that it is not widely known, this notice is hereby issued. Opium Monopoly: Rongji, Tianxianggu, Zhonghexuan, Xiaoleitian, Xingji, Shanglinchun, Weiyunxuan, Tianxiang Shenchu, Datong, Qingyunge, etc." (Northeast News Agency)</p>
<h3>Opening of the Eight Provinces Grain Conference; Over 30 Representatives from Various Provinces and Cities Attend; Resolutions Passed at the First Day's First and Second Meetings</h3>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: The Eight Provinces Grain Conference opened at 10:00 AM on the 22nd at the Provincial Party Headquarters auditorium. Attendees included Wu Huanru and Zhou Minggang from Shanghai; Dong Guangfu and Cong Yumin from Jiangsu; Wang Chengying from Zhejiang; Wen Zhongqi from Guangdong; Shi Jinghuan and Ji Shan from Hebei; Xu Chun from Henan; Jia Shiyi from Hubei; Zhang Kailian and Tan Changkai from Hunan; Yuan Bin from Anhui; Zhu Huaibing and Gong Xuesui from Jiangxi; Yang Gongzhao and Dong Shijin, members of the National Defense Design Committee; Guo Waifeng, president of the four provinces' Farmers Bank; Yang Yongtai, Secretary-General of the Provisional Headquarters and Director of the Jiangxi Grain Bureau; Deputy Director Xiao Chunjin; experts in attendance Liu Zhigan and Dong Zhong; Zou Dianbang, president of the Guangdong Chamber of Commerce; totaling over 30 people. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was unable to attend due to military engagements. Yang Yongtai presided over the opening ceremony. In his opening remarks, Yang stated: "Today, Chairman Chiang is unable to attend due to other commitments, so I will temporarily preside over the opening ceremony. The importance of the grain conference lies in resolving the overall livelihood issues and strengthening the nation and its people. China has been an agricultural nation for 4,000 years, yet grain imports still exceed 500 million yuan. Among these, rice, wheat, flour, cotton, tobacco, and medicine amount to over 110 million to 130 million yuan annually. This phenomenon not only causes financial outflow but also threatens national vitality. The most contradictory phenomenon in the country is the coexistence of people in area A eating grass roots and tree bark while area B suffers from unsalable grain. Both poor harvests and bumper harvests become disasters. To break this sharp contradiction, we must combine grain-producing and grain-consuming areas to manage grain together. That is why this conference was convened. We have received many proposals from various parties. Without deciding on an overall discussion direction, we will be mired in trivial details and achieve no good results. I would like to offer my thoughts on the issues that should be decided and the attitude we should adopt: (1) Identify the root cause. The strange shortages and blockages of grain in our country today, with foreign rice taking the opportunity to dump its products, stem from a lack of circulation. It is like blood stagnation in the human body, allowing harmful bacteria to flourish. Therefore, doctors must study the pathology and prescribe the right medicine to remove obstacles and harmful bacteria. (2) Be practical and realistic. Resolutions must be implemented. To ensure implementation, we must achieve maximum results with minimal expenditure. Empty posturing and excessive establishment of agencies will lead to nothing being accomplished and money being wasted. I propose that at most, the central government establish a central control agency, with each province establishing a corresponding management agency. (3) Focus our efforts on prescribing a remedy. Determine which items should be handled by the central government, which by a specific province, which by multiple provinces in cooperation, or which by government-business cooperation or public-private partnership. This will ensure seamless coordination and achieve an integrated, systematic, and effective method for grain circulation, regulation, and relief. The above are just some initial thoughts. When Chairman Chiang attends, he will have more detailed discussions with everyone." After his speech, the first meeting began. It passed a resolution to prevent the dumping of foreign rice by requesting the central government, via Chiang's telegram, to expedite the levy of taxes on foreign rice. The meeting adjourned for lunch at 1:00 PM and resumed at 2:00 PM, adjourning at 6:00 PM. The resolutions passed at the first and second meetings are recorded below:</p>

The tax on foreign wheat and flour should be a maximum of 2 gold units and a minimum of 1 gold unit. Implement a licensing system for imports, determining the types and quantities needed for the year and allowing imports only within these limits. This year's import volume should be reduced by 20% compared to the previous year, and this reduction should be applied annually thereafter. All of the above proposals were passed, and it was resolved to telegraph the central government to adopt them, levy taxes heavily, and implement them promptly. (2) Limiting surcharges on land taxes: The surcharges on land taxes collected by each province should be in accordance with the limits set by the Ministry of Finance, with a maximum limit of 100%.

<h3>Another Robbery Case Occurs in Zhujiaxing, Songjiang</h3>
<p>At the home of farmer Li Bingxin in Chajiacun, about two li west of Tinglin Zhujiaxing, over a dozen bandits suddenly arrived around 1:00 AM yesterday. Each was carrying long and short weapons. They broke down the door and entered, tying up seven or eight family members and servants one by one and driving them into a room. They then ransacked the house, opening all the chests and boxes and looting cash, clothing, and ornaments worth several thousand yuan.</p>
<h3>Suspect in Theft of Seawall Piles Brought for Investigation</h3>
<p>During the typhoon and rain last month, the seawall at Jinshanwei suffered damage due to wave action. Piles were washed away, and stones on the embankment were dislodged and damaged, creating a dangerous situation. After the county government and the Construction Bureau sent a commission to conduct an on-site survey, they estimated the cost and requested an allocation for repairs. However, Chen Atang, an ignorant villager, stole piles from the seawall and hid them at Shen Xiangming's house. Patrolman Li Yihua discovered this and deemed it a serious crime. He immediately brought the suspect to the county for interrogation. After confirming the facts, the county today (24th) prepared a document and transferred the suspect to the County Court Prosecutor's Office. Prosecutor Zhu reviewed the case and ordered the suspect to be detained pending further investigation.</p>

<h3>Patrol Officer in Changzhou Rapes Young Girl</h3>
<p>Chen Xingsheng, who owns the Yongxing Hosiery Factory in the North Gate of Menghe, Wuyi, has a niece-in-law named Xu Yatou, who is only fourteen years old and of short stature. She is learning to make socks at the factory. The day before yesterday morning, Pan Jincai, a patrol officer from the Second Team of the Mengliu District of the Songjiang Salt Affairs Inspection Branch Bureau Water Police, came to the factory to buy socks. He temporarily deferred the sock money. On the evening of that day, the shop owner instructed Xu Yatou to go to the Water Police team headquarters to collect the sock money. Unexpectedly, only patrol officer Wang Jinmei was left at the team headquarters. The rest were out on patrol. Wang saw that Xu Yatou was young and could be deceived. He tricked her into his room and raped her on the bed. Xu Yatou did not dare to resist. Afterward, she returned to the factory, clutching her lower abdomen and crying loudly. Chen's wife asked about the details. Xu Yatou recounted what had happened. Chen's wife was furious and immediately reported it to the Public Security Sub-station.

<h3>Widening of the Roadbed on the Wuxi-Yixing Road</h3>
<p>The roadbed for the Wuxi to Yixing provincial road has already been built. The Jiangnan Automobile Company has obtained approval from the Construction Department to operate long-distance buses on the road for an exclusive period of fifteen years. The road was originally scheduled to open to traffic by the end of this year, but the opening has been postponed because the road surface has not yet been paved. However, the contract signed between the company and the Construction Department stipulates that the company is responsible for repairing and paving the road surface, while the Construction Department is responsible for the bridges and the earthwork. The company submitted a request to the Construction Department last month to widen the roadbed to nine meters from Rongxiang, Wuxi, to the railway station section and to repair the Wu Bridge. After receiving the request, the Construction Department instructed the Wuxi County Government to prepare a plan for approval. Therefore, the road is unlikely to open to traffic by the end of this year.</p>
<h3>Local Thug Beats Beggar to Death</h3>
<p>In Zhoutanqiao, Xinan Township, District 13, a local thug named Zhu Aji set up a gambling table in a teahouse opened by a certain Song in that place, making a lot of noise. He Haoqing, a blind beggar, asked Zhu Aji for food and clothing money the night before. Zhu refused. He Haoqing kept pestering him, which angered Zhu. Zhu pushed him out of the door and beat him severely. He was hit in a vital spot and died in the east of Zhoutanqiao at midnight. Afterward, patrol officer Wang Xuehan of the third detachment of the eighth branch of the local public security bureau, according to a telephone report from the villagers of Miaoqiao Township, immediately led police officers to Zhoutanqiao quietly that night and arrested Zhu Aji. He was sent to the eighth branch of the public security bureau and then transferred to the general bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou Military Unit Planning to Build Barracks in Yangzhou</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Military Affairs previously sent Director Hu to Yangzhou to plan the construction of artillery barracks. After surveying, the Da Jiaochang outside the West Gate was designated as the camp site. Later, due to difficulties in requisitioning civilian land, the county government convened village chiefs and the residents whose land was requisitioned to discuss the matter.

Solid evidence has now been obtained. Chief Prosecutor Liu Shizhu filed a public prosecution with the Criminal Court. Court President Chen Xianwen specially reported to the Higher Court, requesting the removal and punishment of Zhu Jingbiao.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing Cables Requesting Abolition of Land Tax Surcharges</h3>
<p>Jiaxing's land tax surcharges have long exceeded double the tax itself. Local groups have repeatedly planned to reduce them, but the authorities have stated that the funds have been earmarked for specific purposes and cannot be reduced. However, year after year, various surcharges have been added to the land tax. With the rural economy declining and the general impoverishment of farmers, they are truly unable to bear the burden. As a result, the amount of outstanding land tax is now considerable, affecting the national tax revenue. Although committees have been sent to strictly pursue the arrears, it is difficult to make progress. In view of this situation, the County Chamber of Commerce has previously cabled the authorities requesting a postponement of the collection of old taxes. Yesterday, it cabled the Executive Yuan of the National Government and the Zhejiang Provincial Government, requesting that, in accordance with the Suzhou province's method, they approve the abolition of the special construction levy attached to the land tax, to alleviate the poverty of the Jiangsu farmers.</p>

Yesterday morning, flying south, it only carried 70 pounds of mail and over 100 pounds of Shanghai's major newspapers from the same day, transported by the Shanghai Aviation News Agency to various ports for distribution to various sectors. The crew consisted of pilot Gast, co-pilot Wood, as well as pilot Gluskhu, Groeger, a radio engineer and employee of American Airways Company, a total of four people, flying to Guangdong.</p>
<h3>Airport Farewell</h3>
<p>This was the maiden voyage of the Shanghai-Guangdong line flying south, so Bande, the British head of the airline group of the company, He Zhijing, the deputy director of the business group, Xu Shizhen of the United American Company (i.e., Flying Transportation Company) and others personally went to the Longhua Airport to see them off. In addition, there were more than ten journalists.</p>
<h3>Departure from Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Sikorsky aircraft left the water surface of Longhua Airport at 6:02 AM yesterday. The weather was good yesterday morning, so after leaving the water surface, it rose slowly and flew swiftly towards the outer Wusong Estuary. Those who saw it off clapped their hands and cheered. Yesterday was also a favorable wind, so the flight was quite fast. Within a few minutes, the shadow of the aircraft was already gone. The well-wishers departed separately in the cheering.</p>
<h3>Safe Arrival in Guangdong</h3>
<p>After the aircraft left Shanghai, according to the wireless radio report received by the company, it arrived at Luzhou at 8:27 AM and departed at 8:33 AM.

<h3>Eagerly Reading Shanghai Newspapers</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Aviation News Agency at 314 Xin San Yi Road, Shandong Road in this city, shipped hundreds of copies of Shanghai newspapers yesterday morning and distributed them to people in various ports along the way. Because the agency had telegraphed the news to newspapers in various ports the day before, those who went to the airport to collect them were eager to read them. In the future, the agency will have Shanghai newspapers shipped out every issue and reduce the selling price to promote them. Tomorrow, when the northbound plane arrives in Shanghai, there will also be some Guangzhou newspapers brought to Shanghai and distributed to various sectors.</p>
<h3>Air Freight</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Guangdong line will not carry passengers temporarily within a month, but it can transport as much cargo as possible. It costs 7 jiao per pound to WenZhou, 1 yuan 3 jiao to Fuzhou, 1 yuan 7 jiao 5 to Xiamen, 2 yuan to Shantou, and 2 yuan 7 jiao to Luzhou. All those who consign through the Shanghai Aviation News Agency will receive a 50% discount on the above prices. It is reported that the agency can also handle freight transport and insurance for various sectors in Shanghai, and the fees are extremely low.</p>
<h3>Today's Return to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The plane, after flying to Canton yesterday, is scheduled to depart Guangzhou at 0:30 PM today to return to Shanghai, with a scheduled overnight stop in Shantou. It will depart Shantou for Shanghai at 6:15 AM the morning after tomorrow and arrive at the airfield at exactly 3:00 PM.

The official passenger service of the plane will commence after one month, it is said.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Observes the Far Eastern Situation, China's Response to Such Incidents, Song Did Not Answer Unequivocally</h3>
<p>With Japan and Russia actively preparing for war and the situation in the Far East becoming increasingly tense, Finance Minister Song Ziwen, when meeting with reporters the day before yesterday, answered a reporter's question, saying that Japan and Russia are actively preparing for war, but when the conflict will begin is something that outsiders cannot know. The trends of international affairs can be inferred, but international actions change at any time and cannot be predicted. Subsequently, a reporter asked Song what attitude China would take if Japan and Russia went to war. Song seemed unwilling to express his views on this issue and did not answer unequivocally. It was rumored that Song's answer included how China would respond to such incidents in the future, but this could not be discussed at this time. Song did not actually say this at the time, and it is likely due to a misunderstanding by one or two people.</p>
<h3>After the Establishment of the Cotton Industry Control Association, All Committee Members Took Office and Sent Telegrams, The Standing Committee Discussed Stabilizing Yarn Prices the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>Since the Cotton Industry Control Association affiliated with the National Economic Council was officially announced on the 16th of this month, all committee members have also taken office and started working. The day before yesterday (23rd) at 4:00 PM, the association held its first standing committee meeting at its headquarters on Jiujiang Road. In addition to the five standing committee members, including Guangfu, most of the other committee members also attended. The meeting immediately passed a telegram announcing their assumption of office and discussed important issues such as stabilizing yarn prices and increasing production. The meeting lasted for a long time, lasting two hours before adjourning. Yesterday, a person in charge of the association told reporters from the Riri News and Dagong News that after the establishment of the Cotton Industry Control Association, the production of cotton industry nationwide will be gradually improved, which has aroused the jealousy of Japan, who do not hesitate to use their Japanese newspapers to ridicule the association's work, saying that it is laborious but useless.</p>

<h3>French Minister to China Goes to Beijing to Continue Talks on Sino-French Commercial Treaty, Aiming for Signing and Resolution</h3>
<p>Xin Xin News reported that French Minister to China, Mr. Weifude, went to Beijing from Shanghai this Monday. According to sources in the diplomatic circles in Shanghai, Mr. Wei's trip to Beijing was in response to instructions from the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, intending to continue negotiations with Mr. Wang Jingwei, who is concurrently serving as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of China, on the Sino-French Vietnam Commercial Treaty, aiming for signing and resolution.</p>
<h3>German Envoy Arrives in Shanghai the Night Before Last, Scheduled to Return to Beiping Tonight</h3>
<p>Dr. Tao Tuoman, the German Minister to China, went to Beijing a few days ago to notify the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference. He arrived in Shanghai by overnight train with his wife last night. He will stay in Shanghai for one day and leave Shanghai for Beijing on the 11:00 PM Beijing-Shanghai overnight express train tonight, transferring to the Jinpu Railway to return to Beiping.</p>
<h3>Sugimura Flies from Hankou to Shanghai Yesterday, Will Go to Canton after Staying in Shanghai for a Few Days, and Then Return to Japan Quickly</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng News reported that the visits to China by Japanese dignitaries Sugimura Yataro and Tokugawa Iemasa have attracted considerable attention. Tokugawa returned to Japan on the Japanese ship Shanghai Maru the day before yesterday morning. Sugimura flew back to Shanghai from Hankou yesterday, arriving here at 2:30 PM. A reporter from Xin Sheng News went to the Licha Hotel at around 4:00 PM yesterday to interview him. According to Sugimura, he stayed in Nanjing and Hankou for two days each. In Beijing, he and Tokugawa Iemasa visited Foreign Minister Wang (Jingwei) together and talked about many things, but they were all common issues and not related to politics. All negotiations are handled by the Japanese Minister to China, Arima Akira. He was just visiting in the capacity of a tourist. In Hankou, he met with Zhang Yuejun, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, and the talks were the same as when he met with Foreign Minister Du. He was unable to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek (Jieshi) on the way to Hankou because Chiang was busy suppressing bandits, so he did not ask to meet with him. As for the Sino-Japanese issue, there have been recent rumors that direct negotiations are possible, but he believes that the time is not yet right. After a longer period of time, it may be possible in the future. The reporter then asked if the Japanese government has any possibility of revoking its recognition of the puppet "Manchukuo," because China had previously stated that if Japan could revoke its recognition of "Manchukuo," direct negotiations might be possible. After hearing this, Sugimura remained silent for a long time before saying, "I hope we do not discuss this issue. I think it is impossible to revoke recognition." He continued, "The difficulties between China and Japan did not begin on September 18, but originated long before September 18. The September 18 Incident is just a larger part of the problem. I did not mention this matter when I met Wang (Jingwei) and Zhang ( ) in Beijing and Hankou, but things often happen that are impossible today but may suddenly become possible tomorrow." Sugimura then spoke about the Laxi camp, saying that some newspapers reported that he was monitoring technical cooperation, etc., which is a joke. He hoped that the newspapers would not publish such unfounded news. Finally, Sugimura said that he worked as a second secretary at the Japanese Embassy in China for two years seventeen years ago before leaving. This visit is purely for research purposes. He will stay in Shanghai for a few days, then go to Guangzhou and Xiamen, and then go to Guangdong before returning to Japan directly. If he has the opportunity after arriving in Guangdong, he will visit Hu Hanmin and Chen Jitang.</p>
<h3>Japanese Minister to Romania Fujita Returns to Japan via Shanghai, Discusses International Situation</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun reported that Fujita Rosuke, the Japanese Minister to Romania, will pass through Shanghai on the Japanese mail ship Yasukuni Maru this morning (24th). Fujita made the following remarks to Japanese reporters: "As for the truth about Japan, and the extent of Japan's national strength to influence the trends in the world, and the reality of Japan, taking the May 15 Incident as an example, it was caused by a small group of forces behind the scenes. However, this force now almost controls all of Japan, and it is difficult to predict when it will continue to do so. The future of Russo-Japanese relations and the so-called national crisis period of the 1936 Washington Conference are also controlled by this behind-the-scenes force. Therefore, the people must be determined to be aware of the emergency situation, and special attention should be paid to financial strength, production capacity, and the unity of the people, in addition to military strength. Romania is adjacent to Russia and has suffered from the pain and oppression of Russia in the past, and now has a very good feeling towards Japan. Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations means that the League of Nations no longer has any value. The Four-Power Pact has also lost its effectiveness due to Germany's withdrawal. The peace treaty of the League of Nations is also worthless due to Germany's withdrawal. The international political situation is turning critical every day. Germany and France are particularly difficult to reconcile. France is allied with Romania, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia, and has also concluded a non-aggression treaty with Russia. Once a war breaks out, these countries may all declare war on Germany. The United Kingdom and the United States are observing the development of the situation. Italy and Germany are on the same side. Russia may help France against Germany if France and Germany have a conflict because it has concluded a non-aggression treaty with France. As for Japan's attitude, it should be based on observing the trends in the world. Germany has no vested interests in the Far East, and Japan's attitude and policies should be determined by countries with vested interests. In short, Japan should consider its national strength and the trends in the world when deciding when to take action."</p>
<h3>Shanghai County Government Proclaims the Abolition of the Increased Grain Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government hereby announces the instruction from the Jiangsu Provincial Government that, in view of the current state of the rural economy in this province and the people's ability to bear the burden, it has become a situation of draining the pond to catch the fish. The people's strength is exhausted and it is difficult to add further burdens. All grain taxes from the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933) will continue to be collected at five yuan per stone, as decided in the first year of the Republic of China (1912). The additional two yuan per stone of regular tax levied since the 16th year of the Republic of China (1927) will be abolished immediately, so that the people can have a slight respite and the country can cultivate its vitality. Please comply accordingly, etc. County Magistrate Pan, in addition to instructing the Land Tax Collection Office to comply, also recorded the original order to inform all the people of the county.</p>
<h3>Sino-British-Japanese Competition in Qingdao Shipping, The Development of Pu'an Shipping Has Led to Competition Among Foreign Vessels</h3>
<p>Since the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company leased the Pu'an steamer to operate a special route to Qingdao, the number of tourists has increased greatly, causing the price of land in Qingdao to rise sharply, resulting in a small-scale competition among Chinese, British, and Japanese shipping companies for the Qingdao route. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Pu'an's Business is Flourishing, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Leases the Military Vessel Pu'an, The large number of passengers and the prosperous business on the Qingdao route broke all previous ticket sales records of the company's commercial vessels. The revenue from passenger tickets alone in the first two months totaled a huge sum of over 90,000 yuan. In theory, the company should be able to profit. However, the ship's repairs are too costly, with expenses reaching over 30,000 yuan almost every time it enters the shipyard, resulting in little surplus. After the expiration of the first term, it is now continuing to operate the Shanghai-Qingdao route, and the number of passengers remains full every time, which is a rare achievement in the operation of Chinese vessels in recent years.</p>
<p>The Qingdao Municipal Government Requests Continued Service, Most of the passengers who traveled from Shanghai to Qingdao on the Pu'an during the first term were wealthy individuals who bought land in Qingdao and built summer villas, causing the price of land in Qingdao to skyrocket. When the Pu'an's term expired and it stopped sailing, the parks and municipal government of Qingdao believed that the ship's service greatly enhanced the reputation of Qingdao and increased the price of land, so they repeatedly sent letters and telegrams to Shanghai requesting continued service. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company then renewed its lease agreement with Haibu to continue operating the special Shanghai-Qingdao route. It is now known that the Qingdao Municipal Government, in order to ensure that the ship permanently operates the Shanghai-Qingdao route, has decided to allocate funds from the municipal government for subsidies to maintain long-term operation. The proposal has been approved by the municipal council and will be implemented this month.</p>
<p>British Merchants Urgently Compete, The Shanghai-Qingdao route has long been dominated by Japanese shipping companies such as Daqi, which operate the Changling Maru, Dalian Maru, and Fengtian Maru. Since the Pu'an started service, most of the Chinese passengers no longer take Japanese ships, and Japanese merchants are still trying every means to compete. Unexpectedly, the excellent business and large number of passengers on the Pu'an have attracted the attention of British shipping companies. The Taikoo Steam Navigation Company in Shanghai has also decided to add passenger ships to the Qingdao route to compete. It is now known that the company has decided to add the newly built express vessel Shengjing, which will operate on the Beiyang route, to the Qingdao route, with the aim of competing for Shanghai-Qingdao passengers. The Jinglun has good and many passenger seats and a fast voyage. It has already started service.</p>

<h3>The Sea Dike Defense Project in Baoshan Area is Completed, The Autumn Flood Has Passed and There is Temporarily No Danger, The Caisson Stone Project Needs to be Continued Urgently</h3>
<p>The sea dikes in the Baoshan area outside the Wusong Estuary were attacked by typhoons and huge waves twice, and the defense projects were destroyed one after another, posing a great danger. Jin Qingzhang, the magistrate of Baoshan County, together with local figures, telegraphed the province for help. The county was allocated 55,000 yuan for emergency repairs. The dike repair personnel were ordered to work day and night to build the defensive embankment project. Now it is all completed. Fortunately, the autumn flood has passed, and there should be no danger to the sea dike in the second half of the year. The Dagong News reporter went to the Baoshan County Government yesterday morning to inquire about the emergency repair work in detail. The details are recorded as follows.</p>
<h3>The Defense Project is Completed</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Jin Qingzhang, the magistrate of Baoshan County, told the Dagong News reporter that the Baoshan sea dike was completely destroyed by wind and waves, and there were two incidents of danger, which was extremely dangerous. We repeatedly telegraphed the province to request funds for emergency repairs. However, due to the province's tight finances, it was difficult to raise funds. In an emergency, a temporary solution was decided, so it was decided to start with the prevention project. At that time, the province allocated 35,000 yuan, which was a drop in the bucket and did not help. Later, due to the typhoon, the dike collapsed in several places, and the situation became more dangerous. After the provincial government sent personnel to investigate, it allocated another 25,000 yuan for emergency repairs, plus the original 5,000 yuan of wood and stone materials, totaling 60,000 yuan for dike repair. After receiving the funds, the county government ordered the dike repair workers to rush to carry out the prevention project, starting work day and night, rain or shine. Until now, from South Stone Dike to Gu Longdun, Zhangjiazhai, Jiangjiatan, and North Stone Cave, all the breaches have been completely repaired, and 90% of all prevention projects have been completed. It can be fully completed by the end of this month. However, the defense project will inevitably be hastily done. Fortunately, the autumn flood has passed, and there should be no other worries for the time being.</p>
<h3>The Caisson Stone Project Needs to be Carried Out</h3>
<p>County Magistrate Jin also said that although the defense project has been completed, the temporary solution is ultimately unreliable. If the spring flood comes again, the defense project will inevitably be washed away, not only will all previous efforts be wasted, but also there will still be the risk of flooding. Therefore, the county now plans to build several caisson stone projects at the most dangerous locations in addition to the defense project. The total estimated cost is about 610,000 yuan. We have now prepared a plan and submitted it to the province for review. Once it is approved and the funds are allocated, it can be carried out. As for a permanent solution, it cannot be done without 30-40 million yuan. However, due to the current financial difficulties of the national treasury, it is impossible to raise this huge amount of money. However, if a 5% surcharge for public works and disaster relief can be levied at the Jianghai Customs, about 400,000 to 500,000 yuan can be collected each year, and this plan can be completed after ten years. We have also submitted a formal proposal to the provincial government regarding this matter, etc.</p>
<h3>Director Shen Jian Inspects</h3>
<p>Shen Baiguang, Director of the Jiangsu Construction Department, accompanied by engineer Ou Houxi, went to Baoshan at 9:00 AM the day before yesterday to inspect the current state of the sea dike and the defense project. County Magistrate Jin, Chief Engineer Wan Kaijia, and technician Bao Tichun accompanied him on the inspection. At noon, he returned to the county government for a short rest, and then summoned local gentry Xu Jizhong, Tao Yunming, Bao Meixi, Feng Suiying, Chen Jiamo, etc. to talk and exchange opinions on everything along the dike. It is reported that Director Shen believes that the Baoshan dike project is indeed dangerous, and the caisson stone project must be carried out without further delay. He promised to do his best to raise funds after returning to the province, etc.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Launches Northwest Intermodal Transport, The Dabu Steamship and Transportation Industry is Greatly Panicked</h3>
<p>The national railway commercial cargo intermodal transport is scheduled to begin on November 1. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's intermodal transport with the Longhai Railway is delayed by two weeks due to the time required for the construction of wharves, etc., and will not be able to operate vessels on November 1. The details of this matter are as follows:</p>
<h3>Company Staff Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>In order to facilitate this Longhai Railway intermodal transport, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company abandoned the Dabu Port in Haizhou and switched to connecting at Laoyao. Therefore, Zhang Huanwen and Wu Delin were specially dispatched to Xilian Island to inspect the location where the vessels will be docked. The results of Zhang and Wu's inspection were that the waters near the Laoyao coast on Xilian Island, which are deeper, would be the location for the vessels to dock. After the location was determined, the Longhai Railway Bureau allocated 50,000 yuan for the construction of a new wharf, which is already under construction and is expected to be completed in early November. After completing their work on Xilian Island, Zhang and Wu went to Zhengzhou to discuss the opposition of dockworkers with Zhou Songnian, the representative of the Railway Bureau who signed the contract. This matter has now been handed over to the Railway Bureau for resolution, and Zhang and Wu immediately returned to Shanghai to report to Liu Hongsheng on the progress of the negotiations in Zhengzhou.</p>
<h3>Dispatch Vessels</h3>
<p>The new wharf and warehouses on Xiyun Island will be fully completed in another ten days. The Railway Bureau is also setting up a radio station in Laoyao to facilitate communication with commercial vessels. Xilian Island has deeper waters and can accommodate vessels of about 4,000 tons. The company initially planned to lease the Zhaoxing and Kunxing vessels to join the service, but the rent was too high, and the negotiations have been terminated. It has been decided that the current Nanyang vessels Hairui and Haixiang will operate the Shanghai-Northwest intermodal transport route starting on November 15. These two vessels have a larger cargo capacity than the Tonghua. If cargo transportation becomes congested, additional vessels will be considered.</p>
<h3>Dabu is Panicked</h3>
<p>Dabu Port in Haizhou is the only place for connecting with the cargo from Longhai Railway. The commercial vessels operating on this route in Shanghai include Zhengzhou, Xuzhou, and Haizhou of Hezhong Company, and Yongping and Yongji of Dazhen Company. There are also more than ten vessels from Dabu to Qingdao that rely on cargo and passengers from the Longhai Railway, including Dechun, Yingchun, and Yongchun of Yongde Shipping Company, Taili of Yucheng Company, Dalai and Xinping of Zhongxing Company, Guangning and Tonghe of Daxing Company, Hengtai and Yuantai of Yuxing Company, and Youli of Hengzhen Company. There are also more than 40 transportation companies. Now that the Longhai Railway has abandoned Dabu and switched to Xilian Island, these dozens of transportation companies and more than 20 Chinese vessels operating on Dabu are greatly panicked. Dabu will have no cargo to load in the future, and the vessels and transportation companies will have to change their plans.</p>
<h3>Road Association Seeks Opening</h3>
<p>The general meeting of the China National Road Construction Association is seeking members. Each team has been organized and will hold an opening ceremony today from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM on the ninth floor of the YMCA in the Eight Immortals Bridge.

<h3>Labor Strikes Are Surging</h3>
<p>Dagong News reports that since the January 28 Incident in Shanghai, all industries have been depressed and the market has declined. Affected by the global economic recession, labor disputes have occurred frequently and labor strikes have surged uncontrollably in various industries. It was not until the summer of this year that they gradually decreased. However, recently, disputes in various industries have occurred one after another. Here is a summary of the reports:</p>
<h3>The Electrical Power Strike is at an Impasse</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Electric Power Company has been on strike for a month. Due to the company's tough attitude and refusal to mediate by a third party, it is still at an impasse. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce believes that the matter is of great importance and has specially sent Commissioner Bao Huaguo to Shanghai for investigation. Bao has already telegraphed the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to report on the investigation. Once the matter is completed, he will return to Beijing. The Bureau of Public Works, in response to the requests from various organizations, has also begun mediation. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, President Fei Xindun invited Municipal Councilor Du Yuesheng to the bureau to discuss the solution. The details have not been released yet. The General Labor Union will hold a symposium at 2:00 PM today at the Fuyou Road Clubhouse to discuss concrete assistance measures. At the same time, the General Labor Union will make more serious representations.</p>
<h3>The Electrical Appliance Association Urges a Quick Solution</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Electrical Appliance Industry Association sent a letter to the Electric Power Company yesterday, saying: "Dear Sirs, We have received reports from our members that since your company's strike began, three weeks have passed in an instant, which is an unfortunate event and a great regret. Our members are very concerned about the strike of your company's employees due to various business relationships. Many of our members have been subjected to various dissatisfaction from users due to delays in installing lights and connecting electricity, and have felt great difficulties in their business. We urge your company to take into consideration the public utility, which is related to social security and peace, and for the benefit of both labor and management, you should take appropriate measures and strive to find a peaceful solution in the shortest possible time, so as not to form a long-term situation. Our members have a direct business relationship with your company. We have expressed our views in this letter, and we hope that your company will not misunderstand. October 24."</p>

The court then adjourned.</p>
<h3>Layoff Dispute at Huada Cigarette Factory</h3>
<p>The Huada Cigarette Company on Beikaier Road, Jingzhou Road, Hongkou, was founded by Ningbo native Hong Cangting and employed over 400 male and female workers. Its business was thriving, but after the January 28th Incident, sales plummeted and capital suffered losses. The workers' wages were reduced to a 20-day month, which the workers understood. Recently, as the company's business improved and employee wages increased, the workers felt unfairly treated. The entire cigarette rolling department, led by Yin A'tu, demanded the factory restore their original salaries immediately, but their request was denied. Consequently, Yin A'tu and 47 other workers were all dismissed. The workers panicked and went to party and government organizations to petition for assistance. Zhang Sheng of the Municipal Party Headquarters and Wang Gang of the Social Bureau received them and promised to send personnel to investigate and mediate. The workers were satisfied and left.</p>
<h3>Tianzhang Workers Oppose Wage Cuts</h3>
<p>The Tianzhang Paper Mill in West Shanghai employs over 100 workers. Due to recent sluggish business, the factory issued a notice to reduce wages to 80% of the original rate. Upon hearing this news, the workers, citing financial difficulties, rose in opposition. They sent representatives to negotiate with the factory, but to no avail. Yesterday, they specifically appointed Xi Jinsheng, Yu Zhengyi, Chen Jingen, Jiang Qiyuan, and Zheng Asheng to prepare a document and petition party and government organizations and the General Labor Union, requesting intervention. Representatives from the Civil Affairs Section of the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Third Section of the Social Bureau received them separately and promised to investigate and handle the workers' request.</p>
<h3>Radio Station Employees Firmly Request Pay Raise</h3>
<p>All staff members of the Shanghai Wireless Radio General Station and the International Radio Station of the Ministry of Transportation on Minquan Road have been repeatedly requesting their annual pay raise since July of this year. The Ministry, as it was drafting staff regulations, promised to raise salaries starting from July by the end of September. The heads of both stations also firmly stated that the regulations would be announced together in October, which calmed the staff somewhat. Now that October is coming to an end, the regulations have not been promulgated, and there has been no movement on the pay raise. Furthermore, rumors have been circulating that the staff regulations and pay raise will be unfavorable. The staff is once again agitated, and the situation is unstable. They hope that the Ministry will announce the regulations and pay raise before the end of October.</p>
<h3>Failed Mediation of the British-American Dispute</h3>
<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, the Shanghai Fifth District Cigarette Industry Labor Union had previously proposed amendments to the labor-capital mutual assistance conditions agreed with the factory in 1928, as many of them were unrealistic or offered lower compensation than current standards. These amendments were submitted by the representative assembly and approved by the Social Bureau, which convened several negotiations between both parties. The meetings were temporarily suspended due to the labor union's re-election. Recently, the Social Bureau, prompted by repeated requests from the labor union to continue mediation, notified both parties to resume negotiations yesterday (24th) at 2 PM. The labor representatives, Chen Peide and Lou Jingguan, arrived at the bureau on time to await mediation. However, the capital representatives did not appear. The Social Bureau received a letter from the capital side, stating that with the promulgation of the government's labor laws, the labor-capital mutual assistance conditions agreed upon in 1928 were no longer viable. The factory had stipulated worker compensation within its own regulations and was awaiting approval from the municipal government, therefore it was unnecessary to send representatives to continue negotiations. The labor representatives, considering the factory's refusal to obey government orders and its refusal to negotiate, decided to convene an emergency representative assembly to discuss countermeasures. It is also reported that the Social Bureau will issue an order to the factory to rectify the situation. Furthermore, workers at the British-American three factories continued their strike yesterday, with no negotiations taking place between the parties.</p>
<h3>Dyeing Workers' Liquor Allowance Still Unresolved</h3>
<p>The silk, satin, and cloth dyeing workers in this city, who declared a refusal to dye goods on the 22nd due to a dispute over liquor allowances, held a representative meeting yesterday at 2 PM. Over 200 representatives attended. Zhu Jintao of the Social Bureau and Fan Guoren of the Municipal Party Headquarters attended to provide guidance. However, due to insufficient attendance to meet the legal quorum, the meeting was changed to an informal discussion. Wei Yi reported on the progress. Furthermore, because of the discovery of two dye houses secretly dyeing goods, all representatives unanimously advocated for an on-the-spot resolution, which led to disputes. Another representative meeting was held at 6 PM to discuss countermeasures. The Silk and Satin Cloth Office also sent a reply to the industry association yesterday, expressing their views. The original letter is recorded below: "Received your letters of the 21st and 22nd of this month, stating that in order to restore the original liquor allowance agreement conditions, the dyeing prices must be restored to the contract prices signed in 1927. Then the liquor allowance can be agreed upon and implemented. If the dyeing prices cannot be restored, the capital side will find it difficult to bear the burden under the circumstances. The silk side should separate the liquor allowance to clarify the boundaries and consider the spirit of labor-capital cooperation and resume work immediately. It also recommended representatives to attend a joint meeting of labor, capital, and silk sides. We acknowledge your understanding. Upon investigation, dyeing prices and liquor allowances must be calculated separately, which is the consistent position of our office and the purpose of this request. We must achieve our goals. Whether the dyeing prices are rectified or not, your association and the silk side will naturally have the right to negotiate. However, our office's request for liquor allowances, separated from dyeing prices, and collected directly from the silk side, is another matter and should not be considered together. Whether your association can accept this, the decision is yours alone. Our office strongly supports holding a three-party joint meeting. Please indicate the date, and we will follow and appoint representatives to attend and learn. Regarding the request to resume work as soon as possible, our office regrets that we cannot comply before our request is met and our position is achieved. We hope for your understanding."</p>
<h3>Telegram from the Electrical Machinery and Silk Weaving Association</h3>
<p>The Electrical Machinery and Silk Weaving Industry Association submitted a document to the Municipal Party Headquarters and Social Bureau yesterday, stating: "Submitted for requesting a ban on the dyeing industry strike, so as not to affect the silk weaving business and endanger the livelihoods of workers. Upon reading yesterday's newspaper, the silk, satin, and cloth dyeing workers in this city are dissatisfied with the treatment of the capital side and have initiated a strike, declaring that they will refuse to accept dyed goods from the 21st to promote their awareness, etc. Our association was shocked to hear this news. The dyeing industry and our association are closely related and have a joint relationship. This dyeing industry shutdown, at first glance, may seem to be a loss to the industry itself. The textile industry will certainly be harmed by no one dyeing the textile products. To a great degree, the textile industry requires dyeing to provide colours to customers, particularly in the autumn and winter. If we cannot dye goods, then white cloths will pile up, and suppliers will be troubled. This will impact the economy of the textile industry, in all, these consequences will affect those factories that are close to stopping operations. It is difficult to speak about the decline of the silk industry over the past days. Since the great events of 1932, the sales of silk have declined, and it is hard to speak about the pain the industry is going through. We are unable to save the industry and the situation is too difficult. The textile industry will lose business entirely, and workers will lose employment. We must ask, who can take this responsibility? Furthermore, during this national crisis, strikes have been forbidden. The dyeing workers do not understand the stakes and are acting rashly, and it is too much to bear. To prevent harm to textile industries, we are asking for an investigation to be done. Immediately stop the dye worker strikes and restore receiving dye products as well as safeguarding workers from unemployment.” We have heard that the silk industry will be affected, and they have submitted documents to party and government organs to investigate the dye workers strikes to prevent the event from expanding.</p>
<h3>Changyuan Pig Depot Workers Resume Work</h3>
<p>The Changyuan Pig Depot at Youche Wharf in the South City recently dismissed worker Fan Ajin without reason, leading to a labor-capital dispute. The Social Bureau mediated several times without resolution. Yesterday at 11 AM, all 50+ workers declared a strike. After the Fresh Pork Industry Labor Union's persuasion failed, the Social Bureau sent mediator Peng Zhenqiu to the labor union to convene a mediation between both parties. Labor union representatives Shen Shougen and Bao Xiangxiang, and capital representative Xu Boquan attended. As a result of the persuasion: (1) Fan Ajin's dismissal was approved, (2) the capital side provided a compassionate severance of 50 silver dollars, (3) the striking workers resumed work immediately. Both parties were satisfied at the time, and the striking workers all resumed work at 2 PM.</p>

<h3>Completion of the Dongjijiang Iron Bridge on the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway; Opened to Traffic on the 15th of this Month</h3>
<p>The new steel beam bridges on the Jinyu section of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway, such as the Jinhua River Bridge and the Lingshan Port Bridge, were accelerated and have been opened to traffic one after another. The Dongjijiang Bridge, built in the Quzhou area, had its steel beams installed on October 11 and was opened to traffic on the 15th. The entire bridge project was contracted by the Shanghai Yangtze Construction Company, spanning the Dongjijiang River with 13 spans. The bridge piers were built with cement, and the bridge deck was constructed with steel, reaching 1000 feet in length and weighing approximately 8000 dan. It is the largest bridge on the entire Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway, and the difficulty of the project can be imagined. In addition, the Shangshanxi Bridge, with a similar architectural style, has a total length of over 560 feet and uses over 2800 dan of steel. It is reported that the company was also contracted to undertake the steel beam project, which was completed on the 17th and opened on the 22nd.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Government Replied to the Caojiang River Dredging Case Yesterday by Telegram</h3>
<p>Wang Xiaolai, chairman of the Shaoxing Seven Townships Association in this city, and others, recently petitioned the Executive Yuan through President and Premier and Zhejiang Provincial Government Chairman Lu Dipin to dredge the Cao'e River to prevent floods and requested a continued grant of 200,000 from the US cotton and wheat loan for construction.

<h3>Completion of New Building for Academia Sinica; Psychology Institute Moved from Beiping to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The new building for Academia Sinica in this city, located at the intersection of Bailinan Road and Yuyuan Road, has now been completed. Its construction cost is 500,000 gold, which the academy borrowed from the Cultural Foundation. Yesterday, President Cai Zimin and his wife visited to inspect. According to academy staff, Academia Sinica has its general office in Nanjing, but because the water and electricity supply in Nanjing is inconvenient, experimental colleges such as Physics, Chemistry, and Engineering are still located in Shanghai. The Institute of History and Philology, which recently moved south from Beiping, has decided to be located in Nanjing, together with the Institute of Geology and Social Sciences. As the instruments of the Institute of Psychology can be used in conjunction with the Institute of Physics and Chemistry, it has moved to Shanghai for convenience and is operating in the new building. There is also an observation deck and radio station on the roof of the building. Once the water and electricity installations inside the building are completed, it is said that an opening ceremony will be held. The old academy on Avenue Albert will soon be moved to the new building.</p>
<h3>Chongqi Salt Fields Cannot Be Abandoned Hastily; Wang Qingmu and Others Telegraph for Relief</h3>

The original telegram is as follows: "To President Wang of the Executive Yuan and Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance, Nanjing. Chongming is a coastal salt-producing area, and the salt fields have been moved to outer beaches, which is now Qidong, for a long time. Recently, they suffered severe damage from typhoons, and the salt workers are trying to recover. However, the Songjiang Tax Police Bureau has proposed to abolish the salt fields, causing thousands of salt workers to appeal for relief. We are telegraphing to request your offices to instruct the Songjiang Transportation Office to investigate the disaster situation in the Qidong salt fields and provide proper relief. Before the livelihoods of the salt workers are resolved, all old salt fields should be abolished gradually. We pray earnestly. Citizens Wang Qingmu, Qian Yingqing, Cai Nipei, Lu Jianai, Gu Nanqun, et al. Kouchao."</p>

<h3>Wusong Strictly Collects Fishery Construction Fees; Two Sailing Boats Patrol Day and Night</h3>
<p>The Collection Office for Fishery Construction Fees of the Ministry of Industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang established the Shanghai District Branch in Wusong, appointing Zheng Xianfang as the deputy director of Wusong. Since the start of construction fee collection, due to the wait-and-see attitude of the fishermen or attempts to evade payment, collection has been difficult. The Improvement Committee, to rectify tax collection, specifically appointed Zheng Feiqing (from Dinghai, Zhejiang) as the deputy director of the branch. Zheng specifically used two sailing boats, dispatching eight tax collectors, divided into day and night shifts, to patrol strictly. All fishing boats entering and exiting must be inspected one by one to prevent evasion. Therefore, most fishing boat owners have now paid the construction fees as required for ease of entry and exit.</p>
<h3>Hearing on the Japanese Rice Shipment to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Opinions of the Jiangsu Rice Association The Jiangsu Rice Industry Federation telegraphed the Executive Yuan, stating, "We, the people of the agricultural nation, have recently been in disaster and are not doing well. Our nation is in a state of depression with farming and commerce. The government has paid attention to the problem of the nation and is looking for solutions. The government has decided on the import of food and the payment of taxes on imports. All farmers and businesses are happy to have heard of the plan. The plan requires that the import taxes of foreign rice begin on January 1, 1934. The tax on imports has been delayed and cunning plans are being hatched to sell the rice while our crops have been brought to the market. We will not recover from the economic situation of the market. The Japanese has begun to ship many rice bags. The Japanese will continue to ship rice if a tax is not placed on the imports. If the Japanese rice comes into the market without limit, then our food market will be operated by Japanese. The power for success has been lost and now the situation is in turmoil. We have told Your Honor about this, so we ask that Jiangsu begin charging import taxes on foreign rice so we can have the power to deal with the people of Su and the nation will be in a better situation."</p>
<p>Statements from the Bean and Rice Industry The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association replied to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce on the 23rd, stating, "In response to your letter Pu Zi No. 3812 of the 19th of this month, regarding Shen Feng and eight other colleagues in the South City who have undertaken the sale of Japanese warehouse rice, requesting a thorough investigation and sanctions, we immediately sent letters to the eight colleagues to inquire about the situation. According to their joint reply, we respectfully state that we have read the newspaper reports that Japanese warehouse rice is being shipped to Shanghai for dumping, totaling 25,000 stones, and stored in Yongxing Warehouse, having been received by Fengxing and eight others. Society is rife with rumors, causing great concern. We are grateful to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and your association for your letters, which are righteous and strict, inquiring about the situation. We dare to dissect the facts and present them candidly, hoping for your observation. The foreign rice purchased by our colleagues this time is Xiaojiao rice, totaling 24,866 bags, ordered from Handao Lan Foreign Company and stored in Yongxing Warehouse. The facts are all there for verification. We maintain that Xiaojiao rice is produced in Yangon, not in Japan, Korea, or Taiwan. This is known to all. The difference between Xiaojiao rice and Japanese, Korean, and Taiwanese rice can be distinguished by those with basic knowledge. Handao Lan Foreign Company is an American company, and Yongxing Warehouse is a French company, which can be verified without concealment. All of these are current facts. Our colleagues proceeded with the order based on these facts, so how could we know that it was Japanese rice? At the beginning of Handao Lan Foreign Company's promotion of this rice, our colleagues believed that the goods were already in transit. Even if we did not place an order, it would inevitably be sold to Shanghai. At this time when new grain is entering the market, the market price would inevitably be disrupted by the dumping of this rice. Therefore, with the agreement of our eight colleagues, we all equally purchased and stored it, intending to sell it when the market price rises after the new grain falls. With the intention of making up for the deficiency with the surplus, we hope to stabilize the market. However, we did not expect that this kind of painstaking effort would provide an opportunity for jealous individuals to slander us, spreading rumors. This is truly beyond our initial expectations. In the past, when our colleagues operated foreign rice, each family's import and export was always in the range of hundreds of thousands or millions of bags. If we secretly imported Japanese rice this time, then this 20,000+ bags would be insufficient for one family to profit from. Moreover, with eight families sharing, each family would only get 3,000+ bags. We ask, how much profit can we make? Why would we risk such a great injustice for such a small profit? Weighing the advantages and disadvantages, even the most foolish would not do it. Therefore, how could you say that our colleagues are so unconscionable and foolish as to go to such an extreme? Moreover, secretly importing Japanese goods is a secret undertaking in the current situation. Even if we want to risk this injustice and achieve this goal, we would only fear acting carelessly and keeping it secret. How could there be a reason for eight families to accept it and openly share it? Our colleagues are somewhat sensible. At the time when the Northeast situation was tense, we also forcefully stated the meaning of resisting goods during various meetings. This heart and this will have not changed from beginning to end. We have been deeply slandered by society this time and have received inquiries. We are specifically reporting the facts truthfully, hoping for your review and reporting, etc. According to this, the previous situation claimed by the eight colleagues is clear and the evidence provided is still rational. However, according to the current situation, when the country's rice is entering the market, no foreign rice is needed. Now, outsiders are criticizing us, and they all have the sincere intention of maintaining the rural economy. Our association also expresses deep sympathy. In addition to strictly instructing the eight colleagues to negotiate with the foreign company to terminate the contract and return the goods in full, we are also informing all our colleagues that they should not buy or sell this rice in order to maintain agriculture and jointly plan relief."</p>

<h3>Yabeer Factory Changes Representative to the Electrical Industries Association</h3>
<p>On the 31st of this month, the National Federation of Private Electrical Industries will hold its fifth annual meeting in Hankou. The China Yabeer Electrical Appliance Factory was originally to be represented by General Manager Hu Xiyuan. However, due to Hu's busy schedule, he is unable to attend and has appointed Liang Wu'an as the representative. Mr. Liang is an expert in electrical engineering, having graduated from the Electrical Engineering Department of Jiaotong University in the ninth year of the Republic. He has held important positions in the business community and is currently the director of the general distribution office of the Yabeer Factory. With a solid foundation in electrical engineering and commercial experience, his attendance in Hankou will undoubtedly contribute insightful discussions to the conference for the improvement of the electrical industry. It is also reported that Mr. Liang will be departing today on the Ning Shao steamer heading west.</p>
<h3>Notice from the Two-Railways Administration: Escorting Military Police Must Not Occupy Passenger Seats</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration issued a notice yesterday stating that the military police escorting trains on the Shanghai-Nanjing line often occupy passenger seats, causing complaints from passengers and undermining the railway's purpose of serving the public. The purpose of military police escorting trains is to maintain passenger safety and should be handled in the same manner as passenger inspectors and ticket collectors. After completing their duties, they may only rest temporarily in unoccupied seats that do not obstruct the view and do not inconvenience passengers. If passengers have no seats, they should immediately vacate the seats. The Transportation Office has notified the squadron leader of the Third Military Police Team to instruct all military police under their command to comply with these regulations. Furthermore, the Machinery Department has been instructed to remove all wooden signs in the Second Class passenger cars that read "Military Police Seats." If such incidents occur again and are not resolved after warnings, the passenger inspector or ticket collector on the train will record the name and symbol and report it to the relevant department for investigation.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs Establishes a Civilian Factory in Gaojing Temple: Expected to Begin Operations This Year</h3>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs plans to establish a civilian factory in Gaojing Temple to provide relief to unemployed workers from war-torn areas. This plan has been approved by the Municipal Government and submitted to the Ministry of Industry for record. An exploration of the situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Initially Opening Five Departments</h3>
<p>The Bureau's establishment of a civilian factory is solely for the purpose of providing relief to unemployed workers from war-torn areas. Due to limited funds, the decision was made to implement the plan in phases and gradually develop it. Currently, the Municipal Government has allocated an initial operating fund of 30,000 yuan. The Bureau, in conjunction with local associations, has rented a building in Gaojing Temple. The factory's first phase will include five departments: carpentry, brass work, straw weaving, printing, and leather goods. The temporary worker quota is set at 40. The equipment for the aforementioned five departments is relatively simple, so it is expected that operations can begin within this year. In the future, if successful, efforts will be made to expand the factory and absorb as many industrial workers as possible.</p>
<h3>Establishing an Attached Training Institute</h3>
<p>The civilian factory will also have an attached arts and crafts training institute, starting with the carpentry department. Afterwards, additional departments may be added as needed based on the actual situation. Unemployed workers in the city who pass the institute's review can be admitted, but will only be provided with food and lodging, and will not be paid a salary. Most of the institute's staff will be concurrently managed by Bureau staff in order to save expenses. Other essential full-time staff that need to be hired will be selected based on their commitment to fulfilling their duties. It is estimated that the institute will be established in the near future.</p>
<h3>Two More Kidnappers Apprehended in the Zhao Liansheng Kidnapping Case: Zhao's Friend and Driver Still Missing</h3>
<p>Around 8:00 AM on the 17th of last month, an attempted kidnapping occurred at the intersection of Rue Paul Beau and Avenue Luba in the French Concession. The victim was local resident Zhao Liansheng, who lived at No. 10 Rue Paul Beau. The kidnappers failed to abduct Zhao but instead seized Zhao's friend, Shen Yangchun, and the driver, Chu Youwen, along with Zhao's private car No. 6996, and disappeared. Police officers rushed to the scene upon hearing the alert and apprehended one of the kidnappers, Gu Junshan, from Jiangbei. A pistol and nine bullets were confiscated and handed over to the Second Special District Court, where a public prosecution was initiated according to the Regulations for the Punishment of Bandits. The suspect was detained pending further investigation. Details were previously reported. However, the whereabouts of the abducted Shen and Chu, as well as the car, remain unknown. On the 9th of this month, Jin Jiulin, Inspector of the Special Division of the French Police, and others apprehended two more suspects in the case, Yuan Jinhua and Wang Zemin, also known as Qi De, both from Jiangbei (both 27 years old and working in a textile factory), at No. 1170 Caoxiebang, Route Robert, and in the Tongxing Workshop on Route de Macau. They were taken back to the police station and handed over to the court for interrogation and detention, pending investigation and joint trial. Yesterday morning, Judge Li Changnian presided over a general hearing of the three defendants in Criminal Court No. 1. First, Attorney Gu Shouxi of the police station explained the investigation process. According to the plaintiff Zhao Liansheng, 22 years old, a local resident, formerly worked for the French Police and is now an inspector for the French Municipal Council. On the day of the incident, he, his friend Shen Yangchun, and driver Chu Youwen were walking to the intersection of Rue Paul Beau and Avenue Luba because his car was parked there. As they approached the car, a man in a new long gown suddenly rushed towards him, pulled out a pistol, and fired a shot next to him. Assuming he was being kidnapped or assassinated, he immediately ran away. The man fired another shot behind him. At that time, he also pulled out his self-defense pistol and fired into the air. As the French police officers arrived, he immediately dropped his pistol, raised both hands, and told the police what had happened. The French police officers then apprehended one of the kidnappers. While he was talking to the French police officers, the other kidnappers forced his friend and driver into the car and drove away. There were a total of four or five kidnappers who scattered and fled. Since the incident, his friend, driver, and car remain missing. The court verified the statement and interrogated the three defendants one by one. They all admitted that they were invited by Xiao Li and Xiao Liu, who are still at large, to participate in the kidnapping. They also hired lawyer Yan Lunkui to defend them. Finally, Chinese police officers No. 111 and No. 107 reported the circumstances of the arrest of the first defendant, Gu Junshan. At this point, the judge stated that the case still required investigation and ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody pending further hearing.</p>
<h3>Foreign Associations Discuss Rickshaw Issue: Concession Authorities to Gradually Reduce Licenses</h3>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, the General Committee of the Foreign Associations of Shanghai held a meeting on the 16th to discuss several matters of public interest, including the rickshaw problem in the city. After a lengthy discussion, a resolution was passed, the content of which was roughly as follows: The Public Works Department and the Concession Authorities should adopt the principle of gradually reducing the number of rickshaw licenses issued, so that rickshaws can disappear from the two concessions within a few years. It also urged existing companies engaged in public transportation to increase the number of vehicles to meet the transportation needs that would arise after the reduction of rickshaws, so that the public would not suffer inconvenience due to the reduction of rickshaws. At the same time, the cleanliness of all rickshaws should also be strictly supervised.</p>
<h3>Russian Woman Arrested for Selling Poison Gas Gun</h3>
<p>Detectives from the Huishan Police Station recently learned that a Russian woman, Fan Lindin Lina, residing at No. 19, Alley 24, Ward Road, possessed multiple pen-style poison gas guns and intended to sell them. The detective dispatched a Western detective disguised as a customer to make contact. The price was set at five yuan per gun, and the detective said he wanted to buy four guns, plus three bullets, for a total price of twenty yuan. They agreed to exchange the money and goods yesterday. Yesterday afternoon, at 5:10 PM, Chinese and Western detectives ambushed the residence. The detective disguised as a customer entered first and paid the Russian woman twenty yuan in cash. The woman then handed over four poison gas guns and three bullets. At that moment, the detectives who had been lying in wait rushed in and arrested Fan. They also seized five more similar poison gas guns in the room and took them all back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were handed over to Attorney Jiang Baolian of the First Special District Court, who presented the case according to Article 201 of the Criminal Law regarding obstructing public morals. The defendant stated that the firearms were sent by a person named Paosuo Fu, and she initially did not know what they were. Now, Paosuo Fu has left Shanghai. A Westerner told her that the items could be sold to a Chinese person. She did not expect to be arrested. The judge reviewed the statement and, as the case still required investigation, ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and adjourned the hearing for further evidence.</p>
<h3>Suspect in the Seventy Thousand Yuan Banknote Theft Case Dies</h3>
<p>In the case of the theft of over 70,000 yuan in banknotes from the safe of the Kenye Bank on the Xinningshao Steamer, the suspect, teahouse attendant Shao Rongpei, was apprehended by the Public Security Bureau and transferred to the local court. Later, due to the arrest of other major criminals, the Investigation Team brought Shao back for questioning. However, Shao fell ill while in custody and was not questioned before his condition worsened. He was sent to the Xin Puyu Hall for treatment but died yesterday despite efforts to save him. The Public Security Bureau then sent a letter to the local court, which dispatched Prosecutor Xie and medical examiners to the scene. After verifying that the death was due to illness, they ordered the hall to prepare the body for burial.</p>
<h3>Shop Owner Commits Suicide Due to Debt Burden: Wang Xinchu's Situation Is Truly Pitiful</h3>
<p>Wang Xinchu, a native of Hunan, 29 years old, was engaged in the business of tobacco leaves and liquor in Shanghai. Wang Fozhou, also from Hunan, ran the Lao Taichang Hotel at No. 143 Rue Wagner in the French Concession. Due to poor business, he was heavily in debt and unable to maintain the hotel. This summer, he sold the shop to Wang Xinchu. Unexpectedly, Wang Fozhou did not settle his debts after receiving the sale price, but instead fled with the money. After Wang Xinchu took over the shop, he did not publish a statement in the newspaper, nor did he change the brand name or add any markings. He continued to operate under the original name, Lao Taichang. As a result, Shen Yuanfa, the owner of Yuanxingchang Hotel, a fellow business in Niuzhuang Road, to whom Wang Fozhou owed 150 yuan, was unaware that Fozhou had sold the shop. He continued to demand payment from Lao Taichang. Wang Xinchu replied that Wang Fozhou had sold the shop and the subsequent owner could not be held responsible for the previous owner's debts. Shen argued that Wang Xinchu had taken over the shop without a legally published statement and that the shop's name had not been changed. He suspected that Wang Xinchu was trying to evade the debt on behalf of Wang Fozhou. Therefore, Shen Yuanfa filed a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the Second Special District Court. Because Wang Xinchu did not provide conclusive evidence of the shop sale, the court ruled that Wang must repay the debt. Shen also provided a guarantee to have the Lao Taichang Hotel seized under preliminary attachment. At this point, Wang Xinchu, burdened by Wang Fozhou's debts, was unable to operate the shop after investing in it. Unable to defend himself against the lawsuit, and facing the imminent loss of his shop, he became despondent and attempted suicide by swallowing raw opium some days ago. He was discovered and taken to the hospital, where he recovered. However, before long, Wang once again conceived the idea of ending his life. On the afternoon of the 19th, he went to Room 38 of the Dahua Apartments at No. 431 Rue Paul Beau in the French Concession and swallowed poison. The teahouse attendant, Liu Jinbang, saw that he was still lying in bed and had not gotten up by 4:00 PM the next afternoon. Liu knocked on the door, but there was no response. He pried open the door and saw Wang lying stiffly on the bed, his face pale. Realizing that he had lost consciousness, he informed the accounts office. An advertisement paper for Ateling pills and a court order for preliminary attachment were found next to Wang's pillow. It was then discovered that he had taken poison. He was immediately taken by car to the Red Cross General Hospital on Haig Road. Due to the severity of the poisoning, he died at 11:10 PM that night despite attempts to save him. The hospital notified the police station, who transported the body to the Forensic Pathology Department of the Tongren Fuyuan Branch. Because his family could not be located, the Second Special District Court was notified yesterday morning and dispatched Prosecutor Wang Ren to the morgue. After verifying that the deceased had indeed died from poisoning, he ordered that the body be handed over to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall for photographing and temporary burial, pending identification by his family.</p>
<h3>Suspects in the Yuyao Kidnapping Case Arrested in Shanghai: All Defendants Adjourned for Further Hearing</h3>
<p>At noon the day before yesterday, Hu Shufu, the captain of the detective team of the Sixth District Protection Corps in Yuyao County, Shaoxing, reported to the Yulin Road Police Station along with Gao Wansheng, a detective from the Municipal Public Security Bureau. They stated that a large number of kidnappers, including Li Liucheng, Ying Jinzhong, Yao Zhangchun, Shen Jilian, Zheng Acai, and Wang Jinfa, all from Shaoxing, Yuyao, had fled to Shanghai after committing kidnapping and extortion in their hometown. They were hiding at No. 107 and No. 109, Renshou Lane, Baikai'er Road; No. 366, No. 4, Ren'an Lane; and No. 7, Wenxing Lane. They requested assistance in arresting them. The head of the police station dispatched Chinese and Western detectives in secret to arrest the six individuals, Li, etc., one after another and bring them to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were handed over to Criminal Court No. 3 of the First Special District Court. Attorney Zhang Tianyin of the police station stated the facts and claimed that the defendants were found to have no occupation. However, no evidence was found at any of their residences. The police station did not object to the transfer, but based on the agreement, sufficient evidence had to be presented. In this case, the Yuyao County authorities, based on confessions from apprehended criminals, issued an official letter from the Public Security Bureau clarifying the names of the defendants and dispatched Detective Gao to the court, which was presented for inspection. According to Hu Shufu, the captain of the detective team of the Sixth District Protection Corps of the Yuyao County Government, on the evening of the 17th of this month, the defendants, in the Sixth District, Er Tangtou area of their hometown, gathered with armed parties to kidnap the son of wealthy household Lu Guanren, obtained money for distribution, and fled to Shanghai. The kidnapping was initiated by the defendant Shen Jilian. At that time, they threw the child from the upstairs, but fortunately he was not injured. A woman, Wang Xu, was arrested, and her husband, Zheng Yuanyuan, is still at large. The defendants were identified by her confession. She was brought to Shanghai by an informant to identify and arrest them. It was found that these people were old bandits from Yuyao County and had committed many other kidnapping cases. A reward application was presented to the court. The informant, Yan Zhengfa, a carpenter from Yuyao who was acquainted with the defendants, testified that he overheard them secretly discussing the kidnapping of the child in an open space in Santangtou. He was also confirmed by members of the Protection Corps who were keeping watch in Shanghai and discovered the location of the defendants' residences, which was reported to the police station for identification and arrest. The defendants all denied the accusations. Judge Liu Yugui reviewed the confession of the female criminal Wang Xu, which did not specify the names of the defendants, and asked Hu Shufu, the captain of the detective team, whether Wang Xu could be brought to court for identification next time. Hu replied that it was inconvenient to do so during the journey. The court then ordered the Yuyao County Government to bring the detailed confession of Wang Xu to the court, the defendants to be remanded in custody, and the hearing to be adjourned for seven days for further verification.</p>

However, according to British law, the court usually does not announce the receipt of an appeal notice. Therefore, it is unknown whether the woman has appealed.

<p>At 3:30 AM yesterday morning, a fire broke out at Luo Ji Redwood Workshop, No. 11, Alley 224, Shanghai-Minhang-Nanzhe Road, Nanshi, due to a worker's carelessness in discarding a cigarette butt in wood shavings. Fire brigades from various districts of Nanshi rushed to the scene upon hearing the alarm. However, the fire had already spread rapidly and could not be contained, causing the destruction of eleven neighboring houses. At 4:20 AM, the flames spread to the straw sheds behind Kongqian Lane, becoming even more fierce. Approximately twenty more straw sheds were burned down in about twenty minutes. The fire was finally extinguished around 5:00 AM at dawn.

<h3>Assigned to a Textile Factory Shortly After Returning to China</h3>
<p>Gu is a native of Wuxi, 27 years old. He returned to China last winter after studying in the United States and immediately joined the Shanghai Bank. He resides on the upper floor of the Shanghai Bank Building on Ningbo Road. Recently, he was assigned by the bank to work at the Shenxin No. 1 Factory on Bailinan Road. He usually goes to the textile factory in the morning and returns to the bank in the evening.</p>
<h3>Absent for Several Days Before It Was Discovered He Was Missing</h3>
<p>On Monday, the 16th of this month, he suddenly did not come to the factory. At first, no one thought it was strange. When he had not been seen for several days, the factory inquired at the bank. The bank also did not know where he had gone. They urgently sent a letter to his family, and they began searching everywhere, but there was no trace of him. Only then did they realize he was missing.</p>
<h3>Homicide Not a Possible Reason</h3>
<p>Gu is a person of integrity, honesty, and inner talent. He is amiable and sincere in his dealings with others and has no enemies. He focuses on his duties and does not like to talk much, nor does he often discuss politics. Therefore, homicide is definitely not a possible reason.</p>
<h3>Modest Family Circumstances Do Not Invite Covetousness</h3>
<p>His family's circumstances have always been modest. He went to the United States some years ago with a loan from a classmate, Mr. Mo. Later, he worked part-time while studying in the United States, and even saved money by scrimping and saving to send back to support his family. Even at the bank, his income was not high, and his daily life was very frugal. It is definitely not the case that he would invite the covetousness of thieves.</p>
<h3>Abundant Learning, Low Salary, Hired by Bank</h3>
<p>However, Mr. Gu is intelligent, talented, and learned. He transferred from Datong to Fudan University and completed his four-year studies in three years. He graduated from the Graduate School of Business Administration at New York University in the United States, obtained a degree, and returned to China, expecting to realize his ambitions. Unfortunately, he came back after the January 28th Incident, and the economy declined. All industries were competing to tighten their belts. After being unemployed for several months, he had no choice but to accept the offer from the Shanghai Bank with a monthly salary of only a few dozen yuan.</p>
<h3>Multiple Unfortunate Events, But Still Serene</h3>
<p>Not long after being hired by the Shanghai Bank, the Guohua, Jiaotong, Citibank, and other banks successively invited him, all with positions of one or two hundred yuan. Mr. Gu declined them all out of friendship. In such circumstances, most people would be depressed and unhappy, but Mr. Gu remained serene and focused on his duties, never showing any expression of regret. His younger brother is studying at Tongji University. He met with his brother the day before he disappeared, and there was nothing unusual about him.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<h3>No Girlfriend or Embezzlement</h3>
<p>Although he is not married, he has only recently returned to China and is still focused on his career, so he has not yet made any girlfriends, let alone had any setbacks in love. Furthermore, there have been no incidents of embezzlement at the bank. Therefore, the reason for his disappearance is truly difficult to understand.</p>
<h3>Easy to Identify in Case of an Accident</h3>
<p>Now, an inspection of his bedroom reveals that his clothes, belongings, and money are all there. Even the salary he received the day before yesterday remains untouched. He was only wearing a gray pinstripe wool suit, a yellow-gray felt hat, and black leather shoes, suggesting that he did not intend to leave Shanghai for another city. It is said that the wallet he carried with him had the English letters "Ku Ting-Chi" on it. If he were to have an accident, he would not be difficult to identify.</p>
<p>His family has come to Shanghai to report the disappearance to the police and is seeking information from all sides. If any of his relatives or friends know of his whereabouts, please immediately notify Qin Lizhai of the Editorial Department of Shen Bao at No. 24 Hankou Road so that his family can be informed.</p>
<h3>Public Bus Company in Zhabei Supplying Vehicles to Serve the Downtown Area Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Huashang Public Bus Company was founded in the 17th year of the Republic of China and has had good results. Unfortunately, almost all of its vehicles were lost in the January 28th Incident. Huang Zhongwen, the general manager of the company, has been trying his best to maintain it and is now restoring its former glory. With the completion of the new Municipal Government Building and the preparation of various departments to relocate next New Year's Day, the company felt that the capacity of its past vehicles was not very comfortable. Therefore, it ordered twelve three-and-a-half-ton large open-top bus chassis from the United States, which have now arrived in port. It is reported that the company is starting to build the bodies of the buses to meet the transportation needs of the downtown area.</p>
<h3>Manager of Lihua Company Accused of Selling Obscene Pictures</h3>
<p>Li Yaodong, the Chinese detective chief of the Political Department of the General Police Station, recently learned that the Lihua Company at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Henan Road was selling obscene pictures, which he believed was detrimental to public morals. Therefore, he instructed detectives to purchase nineteen nude pictures from the company at a price of three yuan. The pictures included both Western and Chinese men and women, some completely naked, others half-naked. Although some of the pictures were not very obscene, they were still suggestive. He reported the case to the Legal Department of the Public Works Department, and Attorney Qian Xunjiu filed a public prosecution against Liang Meishou, the general manager of the Lihua Company, in the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, in accordance with Article 251 of the Criminal Law regarding the crime of harming public morals. The First Special Court issued a subpoena, ordering Liang to appear in Criminal Court No. 2 for questioning yesterday morning. When Liang failed to appear, a Mr. Chen appeared in court on his behalf. Attorney Qian of the police station argued that since the police station was accusing Liang Meishou, Liang should appear in person. Since Mr. Chen had not obtained Liang's power of attorney, he had no right to act as his agent. The court should order Liang to appear in court. Judge Huang Risheng approved the motion and ordered that Liang Meishou be summoned to appear in court for questioning at a later date.</p>

<h3>Yong An Tang Medicines to Be Reduced in Price - New Shantou Pharmaceutical Factory Completed</h3>
<p>Tiger Balm Yong An Tang, established in Southeast Asia, issues Ten Thousand Gold Oil, Bagua Dan, Headache Powder, Refreshing Water, and other medicines that have been selling for a long time and are famous both at home and abroad. In recent years, they have begun to sell in the country, and sales have been increasing day by day. The medicines are excellent, well-supervised, and have a very significant effect on reviving the dying. Therefore, wherever the medicines go, they are well-received by the people. The company's owner has repeatedly donated to disaster relief and rescue efforts in the country for many years, and philanthropists at home and abroad have purchased them. All who receive the medicines are cured, saving countless lives. However, the company's medicines have always been manufactured in Southeast Asia, making the procurement of raw materials difficult, and the labor costs are also high. In addition, transportation costs are high. Although the prices have been set very low for domestic sales over the years, they are still considered too high given the difficult situation in the country. The company's owner, Hu Wenhu, has always had a compassionate heart and understands that the original purpose of good medicines is to provide relief. Therefore, he recently established a branch factory in Shantou to manufacture medicines, which are then transported to the country. This reduces labor costs and speeds up delivery, allowing for a further reduction in price to save more people from illness. At the same time, letters from various organizations and philanthropists in the country have stated that the country has repeatedly suffered from water and drought disasters, and has repeatedly encountered soldiers and bandits looting. The poor and sick have no way to seek medical treatment, and only the company's medicines have a reputation that is deeply rooted in people's minds and are regarded as the only savior. They request a price reduction so that the medicines can be widely available. The company, because of the urgent needs of the poor and sick and in line with its original purpose, will implement a price reduction at the beginning of the completion of the Shantou factory, effective from November 1st, using the new prices for delivery, in order to expand sales and provide universal relief.</p>

<h3>Malaya vs. Westerners Water Polo Showdown Tonight 丨 7:30 PM at the West Qing Swimming Pool 丨 Miss Yang Xiuqiong to Participate in Mixed Relay 丨 Yang Brothers to Perform Bound-Feet Swimming</h3>
<p>The Malaya swimming team organized by Guangdong and Hong Kong athletes played against the Shanghai Westerners team for two nights. Unfortunately, they lost by five points. It was especially regrettable that Malaya failed to win the final water polo match on the second night, which led to the loss. The tension of the competition was unprecedented. The reason for the failure was the lack of heat in the pool and the athletes being tired from other competitions. Therefore, in order to make a final decisive victory, they have specially agreed to have another water polo match at the West Qing Swimming Pool at 7:30 PM tonight. Both sides have been resting and replenishing their energy, and the lineups have been completely refreshed. They are listed below:</p>
<p>▲ Malaya Team: Chen Qisong, Huang Jiliang, Guo Zhenheng, Wang Xinmin, Yang Henghua, Chen Fuxing, Zhou Qin.</p>
<p>▲ Westerners Team: Davis, Johnston, Sinclair, Huashidan, Mailiestuo, Sinclair, Bairang, Faping.</p>
<p>▲ Mixed Relay: Before the water polo match, there will be a 200-yard mixed relay race performance. The Malaya team will have Yang Xiuqiong and her sister Miss Xiuzhen participate. The full team is Chen Qisong, Wang Xinmin, Miss Yang Xiuqiong, and Miss Yang Xiuzhen. The Westerners team is Miss Billing, Miss Neil, Haibeite, and Haitlai. The strength is evenly matched, and it is worth seeing.</p>
<p>▲ Bound-Feet Swimming: There is also a performance by the Yang brothers, Henghua and Yuanhua, of bound-feet swimming. The distance is 50 yards. It is also rare to see swimming with both feet bound.</p>
<p>▲ West Qing Announcement: West Qing announces that due to other practices in the swimming pool tonight, it will not be open until 7:00 PM. Tickets are one yuan each. The Guangdong and Hong Kong athletes will leave Shanghai tomorrow morning. This is the last chance to appreciate water skills.</p>
<h3>Who is Higher and Who is Lower? Xu Chengji to Fight Qiu Feihai Again ▲ 3 PM This Afternoon at the Chinese Tennis Court</h3>
<p>Xu Chengji, a famous overseas Chinese tennis player from Batavia, defeated Qiu Feihai in straight sets at the National Games in Beijing this time, and everyone was shocked for a moment. However, Qiu then defeated Lin Baohua, and Xu was defeated by Lin, forming a triangle in circulation. Xu came to Shanghai and lost to Lin Baohua by a score of 1 to 3 in a performance on Monday. At 3 PM this afternoon, Xu Chengji will fight Qiu Feihai again for a farewell performance. Whether Qiu Feihai can avenge his previous defeat and whether Xu Chengji is indeed higher than Qiu, today's performance can serve as a reference for the general public. Admission is one yuan. Enter and exit from Marlborough Road. The circulating results of Xu, Qiu, Lin, etc., are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Championship vs. Championship, Two Against One, South China Fortunately Defeats East China 丨 Li Yichen Misses Two Penalty Kicks in a Row 丨 In Terms of Strength, South China is Not Better Than East China</h3>
<p>The South China Association, the Hong Kong football champion of the previous term, and the East China Association, the Shanghai football champion of the previous term, met at the Chinese Baseball Field yesterday. In the championship vs. championship match, fans were eager to see it first. Therefore, although yesterday was not a holiday, there were still five or six thousand spectators. In the first half, South China first scored a penalty kick to take the lead. Then, Li Yichen recovered the loss, making it 1 to 1. In the second half, East China had two penalty kick opportunities. Li Yichen took the kicks, but missed both times. Liang Darong of South China bravely took the lead and won another goal. As a result, South China defeated East China 2 to 1.</p>
<h3>Artistically, Both Feel Deficient</h3>
<p>Both teams are champions. Who is stronger and who is weaker? Fans are particularly concerned and expect a wonderful performance. However, the lineups on both sides were not perfect, so the performance was slow and relaxed, and not tense. It is said that Chen Jiaqiu of East China is going to join Youyou. He did not play yesterday, and the use of newcomers in the front line inevitably reduced the performance. Bao Jiaping of South China served as the center forward, and the coordination was better than East China, but he had no talent for shooting and could not enter the goal, making the kick very uninteresting. Compared with the Hong Kong-Shanghai battle a few days ago, it was far from the same.</p>

<h3>Bao Jiaping Takes the Lead</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the match, South China's momentum was very strong, and crises appeared frequently in front of East China's goal. Dr. Tu bravely took the lead,搶救 from east to west. Occasionally, he was careless and was penalized with a penalty kick. Bao Jiaping took the main kick, and kicked it in one fell swoop. It fell right into the hands of Lu Da. The fans cheered and celebrated the escape. Unexpectedly, Chen Jixiang shook his hand and requested a re-kick because the order was not issued. So Lao Bao got the trick and shot from the corner of the goal. Lu Zhongen could not save it in time, and East China lost the first goal.</p>
<h3>Li Yichen Divides the World Equally</h3>
<p>After losing the goal, East China vowed to counterattack. The cavalry went out in all directions, and the South China team was in danger. Fortunately, Li Tiansheng defended his team effectively and defused the danger many times. Now the teams were gaining and losing momentum mutually. At thirty minutes, Cao Qiuting got the ball on the right, and ran like a horse, breaking through three passes, and passed it to Li Yichen. Yichen did not panic, and with a crane-like turn, shot with his right foot into the air. The ball fell into the net like a flying arrow. The first half ended, with a score of one to one.</p>
<h3>Two Missed Penalty Kicks</h3>
<p>East China was eager to win at the start of the second half, and morale was high. Li Tiansheng touched the ball with his hand and was penalized with a penalty kick. Li Yichen took the main kick, but it was neither high nor low, hitting Huang Jiliang's hand. South China escaped danger. The second time, Liu Mao pushed down Dr. Tu and was penalized with a penalty kick. Li Yichen was still in charge of the kick. Yichen was unsuccessful the first time, and this time he intended to build achievements, hoping to shoot from the corner of the goal. Unexpectedly, it was too clever, and he kicked out and hit the left post. South China escaped danger again. From then on, East China's fate became more and more dangerous.</p>
<h3>Liang Darong Cleverly Achieves Great Merit</h3>
<p>After South China escaped danger twice, the forwards were as lively as dragons and tigers, and they could not be stopped. Wu Baoqu took the lead, breaking through the East China inner defense line and passing to Yang Shuiyi. Shuiyi lightly touched the ball in front of the goal. Liang Darong did not hesitate and hooked it into the goal, clearly and beautifully. Lu Damentu shouted helplessly. East China lost another goal. Although he tried his best to counterattack, the South China defense was tight, and Li Tiansheng's steel barrier was difficult to break. When the silver whistle sounded, the end was announced, and South China defeated East China 2 to 1. The referee was Chen Jixiang. The lineups on both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ South China Team</p>
<p>Wu Baoqu</p>
<p>Liu Mao Li Guowei Liang Darong</p>
<p>Huang Jiliang Liang Rongzhao Bao Jiaping</p>
<p>Li Tiansheng Tang Kun Huang Meishun</p>
<p>Yang Shuiyi</p>
<p>▲ East China Team</p>

<h3>The Shanghai Branch of the Educational Film Association Has Received a Large Batch of New Films</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Educational Film Association has been preparing to implement film education. It began implementing its plan to screen films in various schools in January of this month. To date, it has screened films in over 100 schools, with over 100,000 viewers. However, because the scheduled films could not be delivered to Shanghai, the content of the films screened was not entirely satisfactory. It has been reported that the branch received a large batch of films the day before yesterday, totaling over 190 educational films, the majority of which are related to science, with many others on industry, crafts, and plants. They are currently working on translating and subtitling them into Chinese, which is expected to be sufficient for a year. In addition, there are about 40 comedy films starring Chaplin, Rock, Laurel, and Hardy, and over 20 animated films, which will be inserted into various programs to increase the interest of viewers. There are also a large number of films on agriculture, physiology, medicine, and military affairs, totaling about 10,000 reels, of which at least several hundred are expected to arrive by mid-March next year. It is reported that the Association, due to the increasing number of films, is planning to promote them nationwide and has drafted a simple set of film rental regulations, which will be submitted to the fourth joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees at the end of this month for discussion. Once passed, they will begin renting them to social education organizations in various places for application.</p>

<h3>The Secondary School Education Association Will Hold English and Chinese Speech Contests; ▲Scheduled for 1:00 PM on November 2nd; ▲Location: Municipal Public Education Hall</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Secondary School Faculty Association, in order to enhance the speech skills and interests of secondary school students in this city, decided at the first board meeting of this semester to hold a high school English speech contest and a junior high school Chinese speech contest at 1:00 PM on November 2nd at the Municipal Public Education Hall on Wenmiao Road. All secondary schools in this city should select two students to participate (one from high school and one from junior high school). The speech topics will be determined by each school. The speech time is 10 minutes. The judging criteria will be divided into four categories: posture, language, thought, and structure.

<h3>The Municipal Education Bureau Has Been Ordered to Ban Books and Paintings with Supernatural, Obscene, and Childish Content</h3>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau recently received an order from the Municipal Government, in accordance with a request from the Ministry of Interior, to ban popular books and paintings. It is found that children's and popular books and paintings have a significant impact on national and social security, culture, customs, and thought. Recently, it has been found that booksellers and small stalls in various ports often fabricate stories with supernatural and obscene words and compile them into booklets, with pictures above and simple words below, called children's books and paintings or popular publications. The general public, including ignorant children and people with limited literacy, are fond of buying and reading them, which not only degrades the will of young people but also harms national and ethnic thought. If the ban is not reiterated and strictly enforced, how can we distinguish between right and wrong and correct customs in the future? Henceforth, upon encountering the aforementioned children's books and paintings and similar popular publications, they will be confiscated and burned to uphold the law and prevent their spread.</p>
<h3>The Grand Occasion of the 32nd Anniversary of Wuben School</h3>

The anniversary ceremony was held at 10:00 AM, presided over by Principal Wang Xiaoying, who reported on the improvements in school affairs over the years. Afterwards, the representatives gave brilliant speeches. After the meeting, there were various recreational activities for celebration. Among them, the vernacular drama performed by the school's students was witty and satirical, exposing social ills, and quite meaningful. In addition, all the equipment of the school's home economics group was arranged by the students themselves, with outstanding results. Furthermore, all the refreshments served to the guests on that day were also made by the home economics group students of the normal school, which were very exquisite. The school's implementation of teaching emphasizes hands-on education, which is pioneering among girls' schools in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Wu Songgao Gave a Lecture on "1936" at Fudan University, at the Invitation of the Fudan Diplomatic Research Association</h3>
<p>Because the students of Fudan University in Jiangwan recognized that the international situation was becoming increasingly dangerous and that diplomatic issues required practical research, they gathered like-minded individuals to organize the Fudan Diplomatic Research Association to engage in theoretical discussions. The Association recently invited Mr. Wu Songgao, a counselor of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to give a lecture entitled "1936." He first described the four major world problems of 1936 (the South Pacific Mandate problem, the naval agreement problem, the Ol coal mine problem, and the Soviet Russia problem), and then discussed China's response methods (must have a strong organizational force). His arguments were pertinent and his analysis was detailed. The lecture lasted for two hours. It is reported that the audience was very enthusiastic.</p>

<h3>The Road</h3>
<p>— Fu Yizhi</p>
<p>On the sidewalk beside the road, there are men, women, tall, short, fat, and thin pedestrians of all kinds, just like a narrow, shallow beach crowded with thousands of fish vying to swim upstream. Shoulder to shoulder, heel to toe, it is really difficult to walk. However, those who are good at walking know that they must "push." So, their arms act as the vanguard, pushing the weak aside, and they take a step forward. The weak do not blame themselves for their poor walking skills, but instead, they simply curse the narrowness of the road and the crowd of pedestrians. This is extremely wrong, and they cannot help but fall behind!</p>
<p>To the left is a precipice, and to the right is a cliff. Only in the middle has a narrow, sheep-gut-like path been trampled into existence. When we find ourselves on it, we naturally feel very dangerous. Moreover, the sun is setting, and a tiger is behind us. Therefore, the strong, in order to preserve their own lives, do not hesitate to push their fellow travelers into the abyss of ten thousand fathoms, so that they can run forward madly. Their behavior is insidiously obvious. In fact, the only way to survive is the narrow path ahead. Those who are pushed do not seize the opportunity to run quickly, but instead, they obstruct the path of others. Falling into the ravine is their own fault!</p>
<p>The clever ones know that crowding together with others will create many obstacles on the road ahead. They are especially unwilling to risk walking on a narrow, sheep-gut-like path. So, they turn and twist, and find many shortcuts. Some of these shortcuts are obtained by using various means to exploit ghosts or force villagers to guide them; others are guided by angels in the sky. After obtaining these shortcuts and reaching their destinations, they build ivory towers and crystal palaces on the plains and wilderness ahead, or on the peaks of the mountains. They stand on the highest floor and offer comfort to their struggling peers with an expression of sympathy: "The road must be found by oneself, but it is not allowed to be taken from others. 'Plagiarism' is especially not allowed, friends!"</p>
<p>The fools cannot push, nor can they bump. After the enlightenment of the successful clever ones, they seem to suddenly understand and go to find another way out. However, they mistakenly identify Peach Blossom Spring and get lost in the maze. Sometimes, they find a secluded path, but they encounter the declaration "No Thoroughfare." So, they become frustrated, annoyed, and sad, blindly shouting "There is no way out."</p>
<p>Yes, there are too few ready-made roads. The roads that have been newly opened up from places with only thorns have already become impassable. Now, there is only drilling mountains, piercing caves, and destroying houses to make roads. Friends, work hard!</p>
<h3>Uniformity</h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>The large chopping block stands tall and high. Beside the chopping block stands a meat cutter whose girth requires a one-foot-two-inch waistband to contain. It is said that this is the sole trademark of the old Lu Gaojian, originally founded in Suzhou, which does not need to be registered with the Ministry of Industry or the Trademark Bureau, as it is a household name known to both children and the elderly. However, in the Suzhou and Hangzhou areas, old Lu Gaojian shops with fat meat cutters resembling pigs standing guard by large chopping blocks are everywhere. Even more so in Shanghai, there is at least one Lu Gaojian on every street on average. Even if the meat cutter speaks pure Shandong dialect or a Pudong accent, the gold-lettered signboard must bear the inscription "Originally founded in Suzhou." Thus, even if some are afraid of being counterfeited and specially hang up a turtle signboard so that one can "recognize the turtle to avoid mistakes," there are still people who play a "turtle as a mark" game. Who is the "original founder" and who is the "counterfeit" is only known to Heaven.</p>
<p>When cigarette companies experienced sluggish business, they racked their brains and came up with the "empty pack exchange for prize coupons" method. It was truly effective. Immediately, six or seven cigarette companies followed suit and played the same game. Since the ban on cigarette companies offering cash prizes, a certain cigarette company switched to using gold items as prizes, and the other six or seven cigarette companies followed suit, using silver products or gift certificates as prizes. Monkeys learn to wear clothes and hats, and those who watch know it is the same old routine, but even if they play one routine after another, the viewers do not feel bored.</p>
<p>Foreigners say that Chinese merchants are immoral and love to "counterfeit" and "imitate." It is true that Chinese merchants are indeed skilled at "counterfeiting" and "imitating." But whether "counterfeiting" and "imitating" are not worth promoting is still a question. Because, in my view, at a minimum, it can also express the "uniformity" spirit of Chinese merchants. If this Lu Gaojian uses a two-hundred-pound fat man to guard the large chopping block, but another uses a ninety-pound consumptive wretch, or this candy store hangs up a turtle trademark, but another uses a black softshell turtle as a mark, then this is not keeping order. If this cigarette company offers cash prizes, but another does not follow suit and play along, then it appears to be a disorganized pace. Only in this way is "uniformity" worthy of admiration, so if there is only one store selling hatred goods, it goes without saying that others will not be without them.</p>
<h3>Scattered Petals</h3>
<p>— Songling</p>
<p>If marriage is the tomb of love, then only men do not marry women.</p>
<p>In the past, Jia Baoyu said, "Women are made of water." Now, it should be said that they are made of gold.</p>
<p>The slogan of gender equality will be spoken by men in the future.</p>
<p>"A bird about to die, its cry is mournful; a man about to die, his words are good." So, only dead people are the best in the world.</p>
<p>Although we know that Shanghai is an evil society, there are still many people coming out of the countryside.</p>
<h3>Gourd</h3>
<p>— Shijiu</p>
<p>Telling real prescriptions and selling fake medicine is the usual trick of itinerant doctors. In the bustling city, he would select a site and use two benches and a few wooden boards to set up a stall; some would simply spread a torn cloth on the ground. As for the things displayed on the stall, there were human teeth, animal claws, dried crocodiles, monkey skeletons, and bottles of all sizes, filled with poisonous creatures like centipedes and scorpions. This was something everyone could appreciate. There were also several gourds, some made of porcelain and some real gourds, painted bright red, with the stoppers tightly sealed. As for what wonderful medicines were hidden inside, only Heaven knew. These gourds, whether real or fake, always seemed to glare menacingly at people; and people, like guessing the riddle of the Sphinx, felt they were very mysterious.</p>
<p>I had a relative who suddenly suffered from an external disease. Both Chinese and Western medicine were tried, but to no avail. The Chinese doctor said, "This is yin deficiency, not easy to cure. Please consult another expert." The Western doctor said, "If a surgical procedure is added, there is a better chance." The patient's family was at a loss. Seeing the disease getting heavier day by day, they were extremely anxious and went to consult the itinerant doctor. After examining the patient, he said, "Although this disease is dangerous, it is not a problem; but the cost of the medicine is very high, totaling ten silver dollars for one dose." As a result, ten dollars bought a packet of white powder. Who knew that after the patient applied it, not only did it not improve, but it became more ulcerated, and finally he died. I still suspect that the white powder must have been poured out of the gourd. If so, then all the gourds displayed on the stalls of itinerant doctors are not mysterious at all; and the riddle of the Sphinx is not difficult to guess. The gourd is something that needs to be worn by Iron-Crutch Li to have miraculous effects; if it is on the stall of an itinerant doctor, then its peep show will be exposed. This is also the gourd's misfortune.</p>
<h3>Blowing</h3>
<p>— Yiyi Guanzhu</p>
<p>Don't underestimate the word "blowing." Don't think it's just seven strokes and look down on it. You need to know that the use of "blowing" is very great!</p>
<p>If you interpret it according to the literal meaning of "blowing," of course, it only means "exhaling," and there is no other meaning.</p>
<p>If you talk about the use of "blowing," then there are many. For example, sheng, xiao, tubes, and flutes, as long as any musical instrument that needs to be played with the mouth cannot do without "blowing." You need to "blow" to be able to play pleasant and moving tunes that people are happy to listen to. Even to the point of offering you a "blowing" expert title, such as "Harmonica Expert," how glorious!</p>
<p>If your skin is as thick as cowhide, and when you meet people, you simply fabricate things out of thin air, as if they were real: "A certain chairman is my brother-in-law, or a certain minister is my sister's husband," without blushing at all, then the creation is even greater. Perhaps those colorful banknotes and snowy white foreign coins will be willingly offered by ordinary people to show respect to you. The reason is that they can take this opportunity to ask you to say good things and boast before your chairman brother-in-law or minister sister's husband, to get an official position to play with. Wouldn't that be impressive! In case you reveal your true colors and show your fox tail, then, fundamentally, they will also respectfully present you with the title of "Cowhide King" or "Conch Shell Expert," printed on business cards, which is also impressive enough!</p>
<p>Alas! Don't underestimate the word "blowing." Don't think it's just seven strokes and look down on it. You need to know that the use of "blowing" is indeed very great! As long as you can understand the knack of "blowing," you will eat endlessly and enjoy endless benefits for the rest of your life!</p>
<h3>Northeast Four Company Commanders</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Seventeen: Who Can Be Unsentimental When Thinking of Home, Ash-Like Morale; Soldiers Never Tire of Deception, Heroic Words Bolster Military Hearts</p>
<p>I heard that the Central Government has already negotiated with a certain Western country and can borrow 500 fighter planes for us. Also, another country will attack the Japanese from behind as soon as we start fighting here. The Japanese army sent to the Northeast Provinces is only fifty to sixty thousand men. With such a pincer attack, how can they withstand it? It is bound to fail. As for the Japanese planes, we can use anti-aircraft guns to shoot them down. Once we reach the front lines, the higher-ups will issue us anti-aircraft guns. It is said that a regiment can get six anti-aircraft guns, and a battalion can get four anti-aircraft machine guns, which is more than enough. So, in this battle, don't think that the enemy's equipment is powerful and that we cannot resist them. We must know that we are taking advantage of the situation. If we rush back to Fengtian from Rehe, wouldn't it be a great honor for our Northeast Army? Go back to your company headquarters and encourage your brothers to move forward without losing heart. After the regiment commander finished speaking, everyone was still skeptical. They doubted whether there was such a cheap thing in the world, that two countries would help China fight? They believed that the Chinese army was really not capable of fighting foreign armies. Now that they are preparing to fight, there must be some kind of preparation. At least the matter of borrowing planes from foreign countries cannot be false. Therefore, when everyone first learned that they were going to Xifengkou, everyone's faces looked a little bad. Now that they heard that they were borrowing 500 planes, and that two countries were helping China, everyone's courage grew at the same time. Although Zhao Ziqiang was an honest man, as the saying goes, soldiers never tire of deception. A soldier, as long as he is experienced, will naturally understand the secret of these four words. Zhao Ziqiang was also thinking in his heart, regardless of whether these words are true or false, it's good that he didn't fabricate them himself. As for the source, of course, someone can be found to take responsibility. So, when he returned to the company headquarters, he immediately gathered all the officers and soldiers of the company and gave a lecture in the courtyard downstairs. When everyone was lined up and stood still in the courtyard, he walked up the stone steps and said to everyone: Now there are orders that our troops are going to Jingdong. Don't think that going east means going back to fight Fengtian immediately. In fact, the thousands of planes we bought from foreign countries have not yet arrived, and the day of fighting is still early. (222)</p>
<h3>Small Recipes: Crab Talk</h3>
<p>— Sha Yu</p>
<p>Here, the reeds on the riverbank have been covered with a layer of white snow, the maples are red, the rice is yellow, and the shelled warriors that scuttle sideways should also come on stage in due season, to be gifts for people to feast on. Crabs are indeed fat in the head and full in the belly, with abundant fat and roe, in this land of fish and rice, Suzhou, the continuous croaking sounds of crab sellers, when they fly to the pillow in the early morning, form a genre of autumn sounds of the city. Crabs are indeed the seasonal food of late autumn.</p>
<p>▲Types of Crabs　Crabs are crustaceans of the same species as shrimp, with eight legs and two pincers, suitable for both water and land; their types can be roughly divided into three types: 1. Clear crabs (freshwater crabs) 2. Sand crabs (saltwater crabs) 3. Sea crabs. Lake crabs grow in freshwater, so their meat is very delicious. Crabs are a type of animal that sheds its shell. When they shed their shell, the carapace-like crab shell comes off first, and then they molt from the crab's body. At that time, the new crab's shell is very soft and lies on the ground. It takes some time before it hardens. Crabs can only grow larger by molting once. By August and September, lake crabs have grown to the size of small bowls, full of fat and roe, enough for a hearty chew. Yangcheng Lake crabs are the best of lake crabs. That kind of crab has golden, glittering hairs on its claws and can crawl on mahogany tables, so it is called Golden Claw Yangcheng Crab.</p>
<p>▲Crab Morphology　The morphology of crabs is mostly that in front of the crab shell, there are two steel-pliers-like giant pincers; that kind of pincer has two serrated jaws, which can be used to clamp and take food, and can also be used as weapons. When a crab walks sideways and encounters an enemy, the two pincers bravely fight, ready to duel. If it is clamped, it is very difficult to untie it. The crab's pincers are usually equal in size, but there is a type of small red-shelled crab that has one pincer that is particularly large, almost the size of the crab's body, but the other pincer is as small as a shrimp's claw. The shape of the crab shell is either oval or shuttle-shaped, large or small, and the colors are also different, with green, red, black, and yellow. Sha Yu has seen more than 70 different kinds of crabs in the animal specimen room of Soochow University. There are certainly more than this number of crabs in the world. However, the distinction between male and female is that males have sharp eyes and females have round eyes, which is a rule.</p>
<p>▲How to Eat Crabs　There are two ways to eat crabs: raw and cooked. Raw food includes drunk crab and salted crab. For drunk crabs, take female crabs (each weighing about two or three taels, too large or too small are not suitable), wash them, stuff some salt into the navel, and then add equal amounts of wine and soy sauce; seal the jar tightly, and after about a week, it can be taken out to eat. The crab tastes fragrant, plump, and delicious, so it can be paired with wine or porridge. Salted crab is just immersing the crab in salty brine, like Ningbo's crab paste. It is salty, but not necessarily fresh. Speaking of cooked food, there are also several ways; the most common, of course, is large-tied crab, take large crabs, wash them, tie them with rope, put them in a steamer or pot, put perilla underneath (crab is cold in nature, perilla can relieve it), and water, boil the water, and the crab will be steamed; dipping it in soy sauce, ginger, and vinegar, chewing it up, it is really plump and delicious, not only satisfying the appetite, but also holding pincers and admiring chrysanthemums, it is still an elegant affair; secondly, choose smaller crabs, cut them open, and cook them with flour and vegetables, which Suzhou calls "oily soy crab," which is a very delicious dish. In addition, there are also stir-fried crab roe and hibiscus crab, etc., which are all methods of pre-removing the crab meat and then cooking it. It is less effort to eat.</p>
<p>Crab is extremely cold in nature, so it must be eaten with ginger to relieve the cold. Fortunately, the new ginger at this time is tender and light, and it is also an excellent seasonal item. However, it is best to drink a cup of ginger sugar soup after eating crab, and do not drink tea, and it is even more dangerous to eat it with persimmons. This is common knowledge that you must know when eating crab. The crab's pincers have black velvet-like soft hairs. When the two pincers are put together and attached to the wall, they look like two butterflies. Crab claws can also be made into weasels. Insert four claw tips into the central and claw tip joint rings of a small leg, and place it on the table, and it will look like a weasel. In addition, there are idioms about crabs, such as "beggars eating dead crabs, every one is good," things are unexpected, called "dead crabs clamp dead people"; one is not as good as the other, called "one crab is not as good as one crab," etc. are all written here to end the crab talk.</p>

<h3>Untouchable</h3>
<p>— Zhi Li</p>
<p>A strange incident occurred in Kohat, India, a year before the European War:</p>
<p>The two-year-old son of a wealthy Hindu fell into a well in the courtyard. His father was not at home, and his mother stood by the well calling for help, but there were no men in the neighborhood. A low-caste person happened to pass by and volunteered to rescue the child. However, the mother refused him, preferring to let her child drown rather than let a low-caste person defile their well water.</p>
<p>You can see how low the caste of the low-caste people in India is from this story. In fact, you can know it just by looking at another name of this caste without reading this story. Originally, they were also called Infouchabeh, the "untouchable" caste.</p>
<p>The so-called "untouchable" should have two meanings. On the one hand, it is said that other castes are sacred and noble, and their everything is not allowed to be touched by the base and filthy low-caste people. This is the same as the taboo practiced among primitive peoples. On the other hand, it is said that the low-caste people are too base and filthy, and other castes should not touch them. Once they touch them, their own purity may be tainted.</p>
<p>The caste distinction in India was originally used by the conquering Aryans to guard against the conquered Dravidians. In order to be more appropriate, a religious meaning was added to the artificial caste system, stipulating that Brahmanism was the privilege of the upper class, and excluding the lower class from the scope of religion. Therefore, the various groups in society are separately locked in their respective small ranges, and they do not touch each other. This is how to maintain peace in the world.</p>
<p>China is not a religious country, but there are things that replace the wonderful uses of religion, namely, the so-called propriety and righteousness. A "defense" character in the "great defense of propriety and righteousness" should be the most appropriate translation of Taboo.</p>
<p>"Propriety does not apply to common people, and punishment does not apply to high officials." The upper class and lower class in China do not touch each other in this way. However, Chinese people are different from Indians. According to Chinese "propriety," men and women cannot touch hands, but Mencius said that you can help your sister-in-law who is drowning with your hands. This is "expediency." Indians do not understand "expediency," so the lady mentioned in the above article would rather sacrifice her beloved son's life. But this is the same as the attitude of "losing chastity is a big deal, starving to death is a small matter."</p>
<h3>"Forgiveness" and "Advocacy"</h3>
<p>— Tao Turen</p>
<p>Recently, a piece of writing on "Free Talk" was published, half about young people writing wrong characters, and half about Mr. Feng Zhiyu's "After Feeling Old," and Mr. Cao Juren's "Talking About Wrong Characters." According to my understanding, the meaning in Mr. Feng's article is only to forgive young people who write wrong characters, because it is understandable that middle school graduates write a wrong character or two. However, writing wrong is writing wrong after all, and it is okay to forgive them, but you cannot say it is correct. Therefore, Mr. Feng's conclusion is:</p>
<p>Now there are two people here: one is a student who wrote "留學生" (overseas student) as "流學生" (flowing student) in the article, missing one stroke; the other is a university professor who proudly wrote a poem, saying, "The teacher committed a heinous crime and was punished to travel to the West to study. It should be the tenth stream, exhausting the gluten to make a pot of oil." Which side is laughable?</p>
<p>Only saying "Which side is laughable" without saying which side is wrong, we can know that Mr. Feng is only forgiving the young people who wrote wrong characters. Mr. Cao is not like that. First, he said: "Writing other characters and letting other characters pass is our right to enjoy." Second, he said: "In the past, people called writing other characters beautifully as 'borrowing': can the ancients borrow, but we cannot borrow?" Third, he said: "I think Chinese characters are difficult to remember, and they should be thoroughly reformed themselves. The current temporary solution is to follow the trend of reading and writing other characters and cultivate the habit of reading and writing other characters; (this can also be said to be an ancient method.) Because in this way, the "simplified characters" that already have a foundation in society can be recognized by intellectuals who claim to read ancient books; and new phonetic-semantic characters that are half sound and half form have the possibility of being produced."</p>
<p>He even recognized "cultivating the habit of reading and writing other characters" as an "immediate cure" for making it easier to remember Chinese characters. If so, then Mr. Cao's surname can be written as 曹, because "曲日曹" already has "a foundation in society." Also, the "别" (other) character in "别字" (wrong character) can be written as "白" (white), because "reading white characters" and "writing white characters" already have a foundation in society.</p>
<p>Young people writing wrong characters丨丨doing wrong things are the same丨丨doctors and gentlemen should not just criticize them, but should only forgive them (and also point them out) is correct, but if you cite classics to advocate for them, I think it is wrong. "留學生" (overseas student) written as "流學生" (flowing student) is writing wrong after all. Therefore, it is correct that we do not write poems to ridicule them, but tell you kindly that you wrote it wrong and please pay attention next time. But if you say that overseas students always travel by boat, and the boat always goes downstream, so writing it as "流學生" (flowing student) is also correct, then it is wrong.</p>
<h3>On Diction</h3>
<p>— Liang Shudong</p>
<p>Recently, I have seen the debate between Mr. Feng Zhiyu and Mr. Shi Zhicun on the issue of "Zhuangzi and Wenxuan," which has aroused some of my thoughts. I am a complete layman in literature, but I occasionally taught Chinese classes a few years ago. At that time, I had quite a bit of experience, and I often had to be touched later, so I could not help but write it down. Mr. Shi's intention of recommending Zhuangzi and Wenxuan is only to save the poverty of young people's diction. This is a "fact" problem. Many young people do feel that they know too few words. Regarding this, I would like to write down a little of my experience.</p>
<p>Books like Zhuangzi and Wenxuan are certainly not floods and beasts, and it is not "legally" impossible to read them, but it depends on what attitude you read them with. If you want to save the poverty of diction, then you must never read them. I used to ask students to describe various activities separately. Once it was about airplanes. One student only wrote four colloquial sentences, saying: It made a creaking sound, slowly rose into the air, and gradually disappeared from sight, only a dragonfly was seen.</p>
<p>Another student wrote a long article, in which there were "like Liezi riding the wind, floating in the empty space of the Taixu," and also something like "riding a whale," "the Emperor's Palace," and so on. According to our habit of discussing diction, the latter is naturally more elegant, but if we really talk about the goal of "describing the situation of an airplane," how did he describe the airplane? I was a bit stubborn, and I originally liked the fact that the latter student read more ancient books, but if we really talk about literature, that is, according to the criticism methods of the Eight Great Masters of the Tang and Song Dynasties, we can only say that the four colloquial sentences of the former student are the best choice. He said the "sound of the plane" and the "flight" of the plane, and when it was about to disappear from sight, he gently used "dragonfly" to draw the "shape of the plane" from a distance. Did these "words" come from "reading books"? Or did they come from sensory perception?</p>
<p>Because of this, I realized that the source of diction should be sought from real things. The more experience, the more observation, the more naturally you will write out all kinds of situations. After knowing a certain state, you will certainly want "words" to describe it. Even if there are words that cannot be written out temporarily, he will have to find them. If there are no things, only words, what will those words do? The opening two sentences of Zhuangzi, "There is a fish in the North Sea, whose name is Kun," let students know more about the two words "Ming" and "Kun." What use can he put them to besides storing them in his brain? There are certainly many words in Wenxuan, but if you want to use them to describe modern machines and other new things, or to narrate various academic subjects, I am afraid that Wenxuan is about to feel the poverty of diction. Moreover, if you want to use Zhuangzi, Wenxuan, etc. to enrich the students' vocabulary, it seems better to directly order students to memorize the Kangxi Dictionary or the Dictionary of Words, which is more complete.</p>
<h3>Ganpu Correspondence (6)</h3>
<p>— A Ying</p>
<p>○○er:</p>
<p>Now we can talk about salt prices and tax rates. Salt prices start from the cost. Roughly speaking, it takes six loads of brine to burn a pan of salt. Each load is 160 catties, with a total price of about one yuan. This thousand catties of brine can be burned into 160 catties of salt. Firewood costs about 1.2 yuan. Three people are needed for labor, calculated on a daily basis, with a wage of three yuan. In addition, there are expenses for oil, fire, lime, snacks, sundries, etc. When burning salt, you need to get a license from the government, and pay 2.8 yuan for each day of burning. At most, you can rush to sixteen pans from early to late every day, totaling 1,560 catties of salt. Calculating the cost, each yin (i.e., 300 catties, equivalent to two pans) costs about 5.2 yuan. However, in the salt burned every day, according to regulations, four yin (i.e., eight bags) must be sold to the "Salt Public Hall" at a price of 4.8 yuan per yin as official salt. That is to say, there must be four yin, each yin losing four corners of silver to be given to the "Salt Public Hall" to be sold as official salt. Since burning salt loses money, why do salt workers still do this kind of business? The reason is very simple, that is, the people who burn salt can still keep more than one yin of salt to sell as smuggled salt, and recover the losses and earn some money here. Burning official salt loses money, but incidentally, it is also publicly, earning a little profit from smuggled salt, which maintains their livelihood. But the expenses of the salt workers are not limited to this, and there are many necessary incidental expenses.</p>
<p>Who exactly are the people who burn salt? Those who have their own salt stoves burn their own brine, or buy brine from general salt workers in addition to their own. Those who do not have stoves sell brine to foremen who have stoves, or rent gold to foremen to burn it themselves. There are also stoves built jointly by several salt workers. Before burning salt, you must first get a license, and immediately go to the city to cancel it after burning. When burning, salt police often come to check the license. If there is no license, but it is private burning, this stove will be confiscated. Each stove costs more than 1,000 yuan to build successfully, so there are very few cases of private burning. When salt prices rise, they make "煎牌" (frying license), printed in blue, about five inches long and four inches wide, writing "The license arrives to start frying, extinguish the fire and hand it in," "to prevent private frying, and to be checked," as well as the name of the salt burner, the date of the start of frying, etc. When the salt is burned, in addition to the cost of the salt that is used as official salt, tax must be added. The cost is 5.2 yuan, and the tax is 6.4 yuan before it can be officially sold. If you do not plan to sell it far away, but only sell it within 20 li, then it is called "light tax salt," which only requires a tax of one yuan per yin. However, how much salt can be sold within 20 li? The price of official salt has already exceeded 10 yuan per yin in cost, and the selling price is certainly very expensive. Among them, the light tax is a little cheaper. The price of smuggled salt varies. It usually sells for about two yuan per dan, and sometimes it also sells for three or four yuan. According to my interview with salt workers, about two-thirds of the total output of salt is sold officially every year, and the remaining one is all transported as smuggled salt. The "salt smugglers" who traffic in smuggled salt will be discussed in another letter.</p>
<p>The salt affairs agency used to have a "場公署" (Field Public Office), but now it has been changed to "秤放局" (Weighing and Releasing Bureau). There used to be "卡" (checkpoints), "緝私營" (anti-smuggling camps), but now, probably the "卡" are gone. It is said that the former anti-smuggling camps had the most dark secrets. They constantly used various methods to extort money from salt workers, either saying that they were privately burning, or saying that they stopped the fire too early, or saying that their weight was not in compliance, and all sorts of other reasons. On the "卡" side, they specialized in making things difficult for merchants and boatmen, either saying that the weight was not in compliance, or saying that the number of packages was not in compliance, in order to achieve their private extortion. Therefore, although the cost of salt is extremely low, it has become very expensive when taxes, extortion, and exploitation are added to the people's vegetables. In fact, the salt workers do not get much. Among the salt workers, what you always hear is their constant complaints. This was the situation before the 17th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Two Brothers (8)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Li Weike, written by Maupassant</p>
<p>When it approached very close to the fishing boat (Pearl), old man Roland waved his hat, the two women waved their handkerchiefs, and six or seven small parasols waved very hard on the mail ship to show their response. The ship passed, leaving some slow undulations on the calm, brilliant sea surface behind it.</p>
<p>We can also see other steamers with black smoke covering their heads, running from all directions towards this short, white embankment in the distance, this embankment is like an opening, swallowing them all one by one. Those light-masted sailboats that slipped away at the junction of water and sky, towed by small, invisible steamers, rushed to this man-eating monster together, sometimes it seemed to be too full, and threw out some other mail ships, two-masted cargo ships, two-masted fast ships, and three-masted ships carrying some crisscrossing forks into the sea. Those speeding steamers fled to the open belly of the ocean to the left or right, while the sailboats left behind by the towed small steamers stood still, raising white or brown canvas sails from the main mast to the small mast. These canvas sails looked red in the setting sun.</p>
<p>Mrs. Roland said with her eyes half-closed, murmuring:</p>
<p>"Oh, God, this seascape is so beautiful!"</p>
<p>Mrs. Lu Zuimi replied with a long sigh, but without any trace of sadness:</p>
<p>"Yes, but it sometimes does a lot of bad things."</p>
<p>Old man Roland shouted:</p>
<p>"Look, the "Normandy" appears in the port. Do you see how big it is, huh?"</p>
<p>Then he explained to everyone the opposite coast, that side, the coast on the other side of the Seine estuary, "This estuary is twenty kilometers," he said. He also pointed out Wilville, Troville, Orcate, the Caen River, Luc, Alomanch, and the Calvados Reef, which made navigation dangerous only as far as Sheb. He also discussed the sand belt problem of the Seine, which moves every time the tide rises, and even the pilots of Kilberfu would have accidents if they did not walk through the route every day. He also called people's attention to how Harvard separated the shallows of Haute Normendic. On the side of BasseNormendie, the flat coast drops to become pastures, grasslands, and cultivated land, directly connected to the beach. The coast of Haute Normandie is just the opposite. It is upright. It is a chiseled, uneven, majestic cliff, stretching into an endless white city wall, all the way to Dunkerque. Every small bay of this cliff hides a village or a pier, such as: Atelda, Feigang, Saint-Valery, Le Treport, Dieppe, etc.</p>
<p>The two women paid no attention to his words. They were already intoxicated with happiness. They watched the ocean full of ships, and these ships ran like many beasts near their caves. They were simply fascinated. They were silent. The vast water and angels felt their own insignificance, and the gentle and magnificent sunset surprised them to the point of speechlessness. Only old man Roland, talking endlessly, was a man who would not let anything disturb him. Women are a little more nervous, and they often inexplicably feel that a useless voice is as uncomfortable as vulgar words.</p>
<p>Bill and Jean were calm at this time, and they were rowing slowly; and the fishing boat "Zhizhu", which looked extremely small next to many large ships, sailed towards the pier. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Financial International News Varies, Gold Market Drifts, Falls and Rises Again; Foreign Exchange, Stocks, and Commodity Prices Soar, with Off-Exchange Trading Once Reaching 800 Yuan; French Cabinet Falls, Exchange Rate Expected to Decline, Ultimately Rebounds by 1.8 Yuan</h3>
<p>The gold market fell yesterday but rebounded, ultimately closing slightly higher than the previous close, boosting confidence. Initially, the overseas silver market saw London holding steady while the U.S. rose, with forward silver prices on the Five Metals Exchange rising by 5.5 to 7 li. Exchange rates uniformly soared. London raw gold rose by 8 pence, and the price of U.S. new mine gold was $9.59, up 58 cents from before. Stocks rose $4.49, cotton rose 13 pounds, and the wool market opened having briefly exceeded the 800-yuan mark. However, supplies from Yida Yong and others eased the situation, and news reports were slightly more positive, calming sentiment. With the increase in forward silver not significant, the market shape returned to good, stabilizing after opening. Subsequently, due to HSBC's exchange rate quotation showing London holding steady and the U.S. rising by 62.5, upward momentum temporarily waned. Reuters reported that a U.S. economist stated that the value of gold was temporarily reduced by 50%, suggesting that the British government could more easily repay U.S. debts. Although this had little impact, the gold market briefly declined. However, Reuters also reported that the French Chamber of Deputies had passed a vote of no confidence in the government, forcing the cabinet to resign, leading to a dangerous political situation. The French franc was expected to fluctuate, and the foreign exchange market was expected to sell francs and buy U.S. dollars, leading to a contraction in exchange rates. Gold prices then rebounded. Later, the domestic market tightened, and the price exceeded 10 yuan. Finally, news from the Associated Press via the Da Mei Evening News, stating that French Prime Minister Daladier believed that although the current cabinet had fallen, the new cabinet would improve, and that Daladier's policies did not support inflationary measures or devaluation of the French franc, with the budget deficit reaching 48 million gold pounds, further boosted confidence, leading to a strong rebound. Refined gold was priced at 1,110 yuan. A record of the day's market conditions follows:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 804.3 yuan, down 7.7 yuan from the previous close. Goods opened at 4 yuan. The morning opening price for foreign exchange was 1 shilling 3 pence 375 for near-term British pounds and 29.6875 yuan for U.S. dollars. Bingxing, Hengyu, and Hongli immediately sold, retreating to 3 yuan, but with Richang, Fuyu, Fuchang, Qianchang, and Xiangchang all buying, retail investors raised prices, and banks' appetites shifted. The price gradually rose to 6 yuan. Anticipating HSBC's quotation showing London holding steady and the U.S. rising by 62.5, the price fell again to 4 yuan under the supply from Yuanmao Yong, Bingxing, Hengyu, Yifeng Yong, and others. Then, because December U.S. dollars at 812.5 were difficult to settle, Hengyu strongly bought, and the price rose again to 6.7 yuan. Dalian banks sold contracts, and the price went downstream again, but still hovered around 3 yuan as Shunli, Yuanmao Yong, Bingxing, and Zhengchang sold again, Datong closed December U.S. dollars at 75. Huabi bought February U.S. dollars at 25, and Shanghai closed December at 875. At this point, the price fluctuated around 4 yuan due to unfavorable news. Hengyu and Zhifeng Yong sold down to 2.5 yuan, but in an instant, news of the French cabinet's expected fall and the expected decline in exchange rates led Richang, Hengtai, Yuanchun, Fuyu, Bingxing, Qianchang, Xiangchang, Yuansheng, Yong and others to buy in unison, raising the price to 7 yuan. Yuanmao Yong and Bingxing sold again, dropping the price by 1.5 yuan. The domestic market had tightened, and November U.S. dollars at 625 and December at 812.5 were difficult to settle, and were still being bid on, but because Daxing Yong's supply was still difficult, the price reached beyond yuan. However, confidence had stabilized. Dingtai, Dachangxiang, Hengyu, and others bought, raising the price to 7.8 yuan. Qianchang and Yifeng Yong sold contracts, and the midday close was 806.4 yuan. After the close, Hengxing and others bought, raising the price to beyond 7 yuan. Goods were auctioned at 7.2 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 806.8 yuan, with goods opening at 7.3 yuan. Although Ruikang sold, confidence was good. Hengyu, Wanxing, Yifeng Yong, Yida Yong, Fuyu, and Hengxing, Jia Zhifeng Yong, and others jointly bought contracts. Huabi ate February U.S. dollars at 125, and the market gradually tightened, rising to 11.5 yuan. Daxing Yong supplied contracts, and Citibank closed February U.S. dollars at 875, dropping the price by 1 yuan. However, because Huabi bought January U.S. dollars at 75, Hengyu, Yifeng Yong, and Zhaofeng Chang entered at 2.5 yuan. At this point, the price hovered around 2 yuan. Then, because Mitsui closed January U.S. dollars at 75, Hengyu, Hengtai, Dingchang, Daxing Yong, Yuankang Xiang all sold, and the price dropped to 0.2 yuan. Huabi bought January U.S. dollars at 812.5, and Hengyu took the opportunity to buy low, stabilizing the situation. Later, because colleagues read the Da Mei Evening News reporting that the French cabinet's budget deficit was extremely large, Fuyu, Yuanmao Yong, and Dingtai all bought, pushing the price up to 5 yuan. With Zhifeng Yong's supply, the closing price retreated to 813.8 yuan. After the close, Bingxing strongly bought goods, raising the price to beyond 5 yuan. Goods were auctioned at 5.3 yuan, and Zhifeng Yong sold, retreating again to 4 yuan. The final price was still around 4.5 yuan. The highest price of the day was 815 yuan, and the lowest price was 802.5 yuan, a difference of 12.5 yuan. Ultimately, the price rebounded by 1.8 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The premium was 29.25 yuan due to HSBC's U.S. dollar quotation rising by 62.5. The contract gold price was 820 yuan. According to the closing price, the premium was about 7 yuan weak, a decrease of 19 yuan compared to the previous close. The registered price for this month was 822 yuan, November was 814 yuan, and December was 806 yuan. The morning water was 822 yuan. The registered price for the afternoon market was 830 yuan for this month, 822 yuan for November, and 814 yuan for December. The afternoon water was 830 yuan. Refined gold was priced at 1,110 yuan. Tongfeng Heng in the market bought Dalian goods of 400 taels for 1,121 yuan. In addition, about 1,000 taels were sold by Tianjin banks to Tongfeng Heng, Yingfeng Heng, etc., ranging from 1,111.2 yuan to 1,117 yuan.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was flat. In summary, Yuanheng, Shunli, Dakang, Tongchun, Hengxing, Yuanyi, Yifeng Yong, Changsheng Yong, and Dachangxiang Fuyu Wanxing all bought. Yida Yong, Bingxing, Yuanmao, Yuanchun, Yongfeng, Zhaofeng Chang, Zhifeng Yong, Qingfa Yong, and Yuanxing Yong Ruikang all sold. Dalian banks and Wanxing together made more than 3,700 contracts, with fewer than about 100 contracts offset. Shunli made more than 3,400 contracts, with more than 300 contracts offset. Guangdong banks Hengxing bought a small amount. There were still 1,183 contracts remaining for this month, 2,058 contracts for November, and a total of 20,740 contracts for December.</p>

<h3>Bull and Bear Forces Battle, Bond Market Appears Uncertain; Short Covering Slightly Present, Selling Rare</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Stock Exchange saw a slight turnaround in the market, with some short covering on the floor, and large-scale selling was rare. However, sentiment remained uncertain, with the floor mostly occupied by short sellers, and retail investors gradually turning from long to short. Considering the overall situation, it was temporarily difficult to be optimistic, and there was a fear of change. This was the sole mentality of most short sellers, so the future situation of the bond market would likely see a significant change in the near future. In the morning's first round, large investors bought in slightly, creating a short squeeze. Prices generally rebounded, rising from 2-3 jiao to 4.5 jiao. Salt tax was particularly strong. In the second round, the floor continued to see buying, with issues such as 17, 21, and 41 all seeing buying. Market prices continued to be firm, rising another 2-3 jiao. However, large short sellers continued to exert pressure, so when the market opened in the afternoon, issues 16 and 4 were sold off, and prices weakened, falling by 1-2 jiao. However, some issues remained stable. At the close, retail investors continued to sell off, with a further small decline of 2-3 jiao. In summary, the day's results were slightly better, rising from 1-2 jiao to 5-6 jiao. The trend was uncertain because both bull and bear forces were rolling over positions. With only two days remaining before settlement, both sides would likely continue to battle. The total turnover was 11,900,001 yuan, including 1,000 yuan in spot goods. Futures contracts totaled 4,595,000 yuan for salt tax, 1,700,000 yuan for troop reduction, 770,000 yuan for 19 Customs Duties, and 2,615,000 yuan for 20 rolls 20 Customs Duties. The remainder ranged from several tens of thousands to 340,000, except for 96, which traded 955,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Rises</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reports that on the 23rd, the New York stock market rose due to President Roosevelt's speech, which was generally considered an indirect method of inflating the currency. The total daily turnover was 2,120,000 yuan. The wheat market rebounded, with the government buying forward contracts and factories also buying. Wheat prices were expected to continue to rise, as expected. Cotton: The U.S. President's speech did not have a new impact on the cotton market. The turmoil among Western farmers failed to secure it, and those who supported fixing the dollar's value were disappointed. It was claimed that there would be news inciting opposition to the current method of delivery in the South and the New York cotton contract. There were also rumors that handling fees for cotton and grain would be increased, and speculators' intentions were quite uncertain. Silver: The market was quite stable throughout the day, and prices relaxed slightly at the close due to the rebound in other markets. Because of speculative trading, the future of the silver market would depend on the situation of the U.S. dollar. The U.S. Treasury's gold price was $29.59 per yuan. The Dow Jones index is listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price　　　Compared to Previous Day</p>

<h3>Yarn and Flower Market, Scattered Standard Yarn</h3>
<p>The yarn market was extremely scattered and lacked excitement. The downward trend this month was restricted by a certain association, and general speculators were all holding back and watching, so trading was greatly reduced, and market prices became monotonous. Daily fluctuations were only 2-3 jiao. However, the sales of current yarn were increasingly sluggish, and future changes could not be predicted.</p>
<h3>Soft Human Standard Yarn</h3>
<p>The human standard yarn market opened weakly in the early market, with a lack of buyers in the market, and prices fluctuating up and down. Each month rose or fell by 1, 2, or 3 jiao. In the afternoon, it was heard that current yarn business was clearer, and the market was slightly softer, with each month falling by 1, 2, 3, or 4 jiao. The total daily turnover was 13,800 bales. Gengfeng sold 700 bales, Tongxing 750 bales, and Changfeng 450 bales. Rongxing bought 650 bales, Taichang 400 bales, Dafeng 350 bales, Renfeng 400 bales, and Yicheng 400 bales.

<h3>This Month's Cotton Suddenly Softens; Rumors Spread of a Certain Firm Having 20,000 Dan for Delivery</h3>
<p>The cotton market was slightly soft. The most firm October standard cotton suddenly appeared weak. Because the environment was flat, and the demand for current cotton was sluggish, some long positions were slightly closed. Another rumor spread that a certain firm had 20,000 dan for delivery, so the market conditions were relatively flat. However, with only two days remaining for the settlement period of this month, and a turnover of 140,000 dan outside, the market's volatility was still extremely large.</p>
<h3>Zheng Standard Yarn Falls</h3>
<p>The Zheng standard yarn market opened weakly in the early market, with a lack of buyers and long positions closing. The current month fell by 3 jiao, and the distant months rose or fell by 5 fen. In the afternoon market, the current month fell another 1.5 jiao, and the distant months fell by 5 fen to 1 jiao. The total daily turnover was 68,500 dan.

<p>Taicang Cotton　38.50　Shenxin Factory Entry　1,000 bales spot goods delivery to factory</p>
<h3>U.S. Cotton Rises Over 10 Pounds</h3>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton initially rose due to speculators buying in and political news being favorable to long positions. Later, it slightly weakened due to selling in the South. Ultimately, spot goods rose 10 pounds, and futures rose 7 pounds to 13 pounds. Liverpool cotton spot goods fell 1 point, and futures fell 2-3 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods fell 4 points. The Bombay market was closed. The original telegram is recorded to the left (telegram from the 23rd):</p>

<h3>Grain Futures and Flour Consistently Sharply Rise by 5-6 Fen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, each month uniformly showed a sharp rise, with the quotation for foreign wheat from Chicago rising again by about 1 yuan 4 jiao. Also, because the foreign wheat market had been rising for 3-4 consecutive days, and because of the U.S. President's economic recovery and raising of prices, it was speculated that the future seemed to be promising. Therefore, after the opening price, each month stepped up again, rising an extra 2 fen compared to the previous day. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, each month showed a frantic rising trend. Because, according to private telegrams, the Canadian quotation had also risen by more than 1 yuan. Also, since the factories had been restricted from margin trading by the exchange, although the quantity of goods was still sufficient, they did not care about selling for roll over. General speculative long positions took advantage of this opportunity to try their best to raise prices. Because the short side lacked large investors selling, the long side inevitably held out and demanded, arbitrarily shouting prices. It was heard that factories were buying in for this month, and the rising degree was also sharp. Ultimately, this month rose 6 fen 2 li 5 hao compared to the previous day, November rose 5.5 fen, December rose 6 fen, January-February rose 6 fen 2 li 5 hao, and March rose 5.5 fen.</p>
<h3>Imports of Foreign Wheat Can Temporarily Be Ignored, Wheat Futures Show an Extremely Sharp Rising Wind</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the wheat futures market opened in the morning and afternoon, each month uniformly showed a frantic rising trend. The quotation for foreign wheat continued to rise, with Chicago rising 1 yuan 4 jiao 0. The Canadian market was closed. The market's confidence was due to the continuous rise in foreign wheat and the U.S. President's raising of prices, which had shown good performance, and it seemed that the imports of foreign wheat could temporarily be ignored. Therefore, after the opening price, each month stepped up one by one, and the rising momentum was also awe-inspiring. Also, the market rumored that factories would absorb spot goods as a basis for maintaining prices in the future, so both near-term and distant-term prices tended to be expensive. Ultimately, this month rose 8 fen, November rose 1 jiao 1 fen, December-January rose 1 jiao 2 fen, February rose 1 jiao, and March rose 9 fen. In the spot wheat market, trading was brisk, and prices also turned strong, with high-quality goods rising 3-5 fen. The opening price for Shandong wheat was 3 yuan 9 jiao, and the second grade was 8 jiao 6 fen. Yaowan wheat was 3 yuan 8 jiao 4 fen, Gaoyou wheat was 3 yuan 6 jiao 7-8 fen, Yangzhou wheat was 3 yuan 6 jiao 5 fen, and the second grade was 6 jiao 2 fen. Tangshi wheat was 3 yuan 6 jiao 5 fen, Changshu wheat was 3 yuan 6 jiao 3 fen, Nanjing wheat was 3 yuan 4 jiao 7 fen, Wuxi wheat was 3 yuan 5 jiao, Fufeng handled 4,000 bags, Xinda handled 4,000 bags, and Shenda handled 600 bags.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Return to Small Declines</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) The source was nearly number 50, and incoming goods surged again. Although the original appetite was slightly better, the contract appetite continued to handle about 1,000 bags in the kiln. However, the trend was difficult to establish. Each gang's new japonica and kiln had varieties of goods such as Ge Bai rice and wild rice, all falling by 1-2 jiao. Although Duyang, Jian, and Min gangs also moved, prices followed a repaired scale. Its momentum seemed to have already fallen through, and the sellers were unwilling to give in any further, so the market might be able to stabilize slightly. The path for broken japonica was limited, and prices fell again. Xin Yin Yuan was uniquely strong due to a lack of goods.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Incoming goods continued to surge, about number 60, and the consumption appetite was picky. Prices were slightly reduced. The market price for new and broken grains was slightly 2-3 jiao less. Kiln japonica white rice and Yang Du Bu Jian prices were slightly a jiao less. Baiguo, Bai Yuan, and Yin Yuan were fatigued. The price of guest tip was repairing around a jiao.</p>
<h3>New Peanut Kernel Sales Become Deadlocked</h3>
<p>New peanut kernels were soft in the market because they only sold through the Yinben Street route. Furthermore, the source has been surging recently. A total of 3-4,000 bags arrived on the trucks, causing Yinben Street to have no strong consumption appetite, and the market became deadlocked. There have been no transactions for two days. On Sunday, a secret transaction was agreed, for Shandong goods, opening around 100 bags, with a price of 8 yuan. This price could not be used as the official market price, and the remainder was shipped out first, and then the price was quoted according to the market. According to industry insiders, the market must be further reduced by one yuan to be able to move through Guangshan gang.</p>
<h3>Silk, Tea, and Foreign Firms, Silk Sales Have No Vigor</h3>
<p>▲Vancouver Has No Chinese Silk Shipped There. Vancouver has many silk weaving factories, and silk consumption is also huge. In recent years, Chinese silk has been affected by the cheap dumping of Japanese silk. However, 4-5,000 bales are still shipped there each year. Now, due to the spread of labor strikes, most of Vancouver's silk weaving factories have stopped working, and the sales of Chinese silk have come to a standstill. Yesterday, the Changxing Yahu post ship sailed, and no Chinese silk was shipped to Vancouver.</p>
<p>▲80 Pieces of Xiaoshan Cocoon Floss Arrived. Xiaoshan is a model sericulture area in Zhejiang Province. This year's cocoon production is quite abundant, but cocoon prices are not high. Most silkworm farmers self-bake and self-reel. The peeled cocoon floss is collected and transported to Shanghai by Yu cocoon merchants and sold to foreign firms. Yesterday, cocoon merchant Xu Zhongji packed and shipped 80 pieces of Xiaoshan white cocoon floss, which was reportedly sold to French merchants and prepared for delivery.</p>
<p>▲Sales of Rayon Are Difficult. Mainland silk weaving factories are now weaving winter silk, and the demand for rayon is decreasing daily, and sales are difficult. Yesterday, only the Shao gang entered 15 boxes of spot goods of brands like Golden Kirin and Flying Eagle, with prices only ranging from 180.75 yuan to 175.25 yuan, net.</p>
<p>▲White Plain Silk Sales Were Sluggish. The overseas silk market is increasingly depressed. No one asks about raw silk in New York, and actual sales in Lyon remain sluggish. The situation is serious, and silk sales have no turnaround for the time being. Even domestic silk sales are also declining. Yesterday, only the Hangzhou Silk Factory entered 15 packages of B-grade white plain silk (returned by American firms). Yinzhuang entered 3 packages of yellow silk, and prices were also extremely cheap.</p>
<h3>A Slight Uptick in the Sale of Tuzhuang's Superior Eyebrow Tea</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sale of Tuzhuang Tea Factory's superior eyebrow green tea suddenly became more active. Altogether, Tianyu, Yongxing, and other firms in the city purchased over 300 boxes. The price ranged from 54 to 66 yuan, and the market remained quite firm. As for Luzhuang's needle eyebrow green tea, Yihe, Xiehe, and other firms in the English district continued to vigorously purchase upper and middle-grade goods. However, there were no transactions for wax-glossed superior eyebrow tea or Gongxi green tea from various districts throughout the city, it is said.</p>
<h3>The Sugar Market: Weakness Intensifies, No Transactions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was sluggish due to the impending end of October and tight credit. Sales of sugar from various sources were exceptionally slow. The public association's prices trended even weaker, with No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar still quoted at 21.3 yuan, but no one made a counteroffer. Prices for other grades remained similar to the previous day, but there were few buyers. The market's performance is sure to remain weak.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Walnut Pricing Difficult to Reconcile</h3>
<p>The sales of walnuts in the Shanghai market have been quite good recently. Inventories in various firms are not abundant, and the market trend is stable. However, prices in the producing areas are even higher than those in Shanghai, making it difficult to reconcile the pricing, and the supply is scarce. Yesterday's market prices were as follows: hand-picked walnuts sold for 20 yuan, Changping walnuts for 18 yuan, Haozhou walnuts for 13.8 yuan, southern walnuts for 13.5 yuan, and walnut meat for 32 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Rise in Piece Goods and Printed Foreign Cloth Becomes Sharper</h3>
<p>Due to unusually high costs and scarce inventories, sellers are holding onto printed foreign cloth, causing the market to become even more firm and sharp. Yesterday, Deji's Fifth Road imported Bao brand printed foreign cloth sold for 6 jiao net per original box. Selecting colors from opened bolts added 2.5 fen, and retail cuts from shop fronts were 6.56 jiao per yard (previously, retail cuts were only 5 jiao).</p>
<h3>The Market for U.S. Flag Brand Galvanized Iron Sheets Weakens</h3>
<p>The current sales of U.S. Flag brand galvanized iron sheets are not very active, and the supply of spot goods exceeds demand, causing the market to weaken. An estimated 48 sheets are priced at 19.5 yuan, 38 sheets at 21.25 yuan, 33 sheets at 19.25 yuan, and 25 sheets at 18.5 yuan. Aside from some customers from the Hankou area making small purchases, very few other buyers have shown interest in recent days.</p>
<h3>A Large Shortage of Hunan Pig Lead Spot Goods</h3>
<p>Since the Hanyang Arsenal began collecting Hunan pig lead, the supply of spot goods in Shanghai has become exceptionally scarce. The market is experiencing a significant shortage of circulating goods, causing prices to rise. The current estimated price is 16 yuan, which is more than 2 jiao higher than before. It is said that the arrival of future shipments is still far off, and there is a possibility that prices will rise further.</p>

<h3>The Roar of War</h3>
<p>— Bin Fu</p>
<p>Living in Shanghai, within the bubble of "singing and dancing for peace," who has ever considered the terror of war? They only dream pink dreams and pursue mysterious pleasures. Sometimes they see war films in the cinema, and the terrifying battle scenes startle them and make them nervous, but they never feel that such "terror" will one day befall them. They think it is just a "movie." They are a group of very weak sheep. Although their shouts in the soccer field, dog racing track, and jai alai court are full of vigor and sound, and although they speak of the Nineteenth Route Army's heroic fight against the enemy with great animation, in reality they are a group of very weak sheep!</p>
<p>"Will there be a great war in the Far East in 1935? Who said that? Wells? What the foreign devils say can't be trusted!" Smart people then go to ask "Little Confused," because they only believe in "Little Confused," but "Little Confused" repeatedly says that there won't be! So they are comforted. They are a group of very weak sheep! They are typical Chinese.</p>
<p>However, "pink" "happy" people, we certainly do not need to blindly believe Wells, but we must not blindly believe "Little Confused" either. We should analyze, observe, and recognize the true facts. What are the facts? I hope you will jump out of the "singing and dancing for peace" bubble and look at the scenery outside the bubble:</p>
<p>The murderous black clouds that permeate the northeast corner may give you, who are accustomed to a life of "gentleness and peace," a shiver. This is the sign that the cunning Japanese imperialism and the "Siberian Bear" will duel. Recently, the Soviet White Bear published secret documents about Japanese imperialism's conspiracy to seize the Chinese Eastern Railway. Japanese imperialism became enraged and finally turned against the Soviet Union. Japan's preparations for war against the Soviet Union have long been an open secret and have reached a very sufficient level. The Soviet Union, which has always maintained a peaceful foreign policy, deeply feels that the war is ultimately irreversible and that the Japanese warlords' ambition for aggression is ultimately unstoppable. Therefore, it also roared strongly. In this way, the fox and the white bear have fallen into a state of tension, and the situation in the Far East has suddenly become dangerous. What is Japan's "extraordinary national policy" for? What is Japan's "five-minister conference" for? Isn't it for war preparations?</p>
<p>Although Roosevelt of the United States prepared to recognize Soviet Russia the day before yesterday, and people thought this would be a temporary sobering agent for the Far East war, I don't think this will have much effect. Haven't the Japanese soldiers made amazing bold statements? They will defeat the Soviet Union with their army and conquer the United States with their navy. Their crazy ambitions may not be easy to reverse. The war in the Far East may be the prelude to the Second World War.</p>
<p>At the same time, in the West, Hitler dropped a big bomb on Geneva, which greatly changed the situation in Europe. The imperialist arms race and economic war are becoming increasingly sharp and profound, and the crisis of war is also deepening.</p>
<p>In short, the East and the West are deeply related. The roar of war has shaken the world. The whole world, except China, is busy preparing for the second great massacre. Is this war unrelated to China? No, China's final fate is simply to be decided in this war!</p>
<p>Ah, weak sheep, on the eve of this great destruction that will determine our fate, will we madly sing and dance "Enjoying one last night" or will we resolutely jump out of the pink bubble and roar?</p>
<h3>On the Basketball Court</h3>
<p>— Jing Jia</p>
<p>After dinner, the basketball court becomes lively. Twenty or thirty students gather, jumping, running, and shouting.</p>
<p>Several female students stand by the railing on the upper floor of the dormitory next to the basketball court, quietly watching the male students play ball.</p>
<p>With the encouragement of the girls watching, the male students seem to be even more motivated to throw the ball. Whenever someone throws the ball into the basket, he will definitely glance at the girls with a smug look. If someone fails to throw it in, the others will laugh loudly and scold him for being useless. Everyone tries their best to show off their ways to please the female students.</p>
<p>That's how the incident happened. The short, stout guy caught the ball and showed off his skills, deliberately running around the court before throwing it. But he wasn't careful and slipped on the gravel on the court. This, of course, made the others clap their hands and laugh. But the short, stout guy got angry. He wasn't angry because of the laughter, but because he was embarrassed in front of the female students.</p>
<p>So he got up, grabbed the ball, and threw it hard at the people standing nearby. The one who was hit was Tie Niu, Lao Li, of course, refused to let it go, so he grabbed the ball and threw it back, missing his target. The two started wrestling and fighting.</p>
<p>Many students gathered around to watch the excitement, shouting and cheering. The female students in the "flower building" disdainfully returned to their rooms.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, the two stopped without anyone trying to dissuade them! It was as if they were deliberately performing "The Iron Rooster" in front of the female students. Since the female spectators had left, of course, they could only stop playing.</p>
<p>Only Lao Chen saw through their psychology. He sighed and said, "Women are really a source of trouble!"</p>
<h3>New Life</h3>
<p>— Ying</p>
<p>It happened this afternoon. After I had lunch, I went back to the dormitory. I turned to Tuodi's room, and he pointed to the crowd downstairs outside the window and said:</p>
<p>"Look, there's a woman over there giving birth to a child!"</p>
<p>I didn't believe him. I thought he was joking with me, but he said seriously:</p>
<p>"Really, who's lying to you!"</p>
<p>"Okay, let me go and find out for myself."</p>
<p>I walked downstairs to the back door of the dormitory, half believing and half doubting. Sure enough, there were a dozen or so students standing there, all watching the opposite bank of the small river. So, I joined the crowd.</p>
<p>Our school is surrounded by a small river. Many green willows are planted along the riverbank. The woman was sitting on the farmland next to the path on the opposite bank. Looking across the river, we could only see her upper body clearly because of the willows. Her lower body seemed to be covered with a piece of grayish-black tattered cloth. She was sitting with her back bent, looking extremely tired. She was about forty years old, with a sallow complexion, wearing a half-old blue homespun shirt. This was clearly a poor, working-class woman.</p>
<p>Seven or eight women gathered around her, talking to her. She unbuttoned her clothes and showed the newborn child to them. They sympathized with her and helped her. Some brought old cloth, and some brought a cup of water for her to drink. They had just run over from the nearby fields, all wearing homespun shirts, with cloth hand towels on their heads, with sallow complexions, just like her, poor working-class people!</p>
<p>A student wrapped an old piece of clothing and asked a child on the opposite bank to wade across the river to deliver it. She nodded in acceptance, expressing her gratitude.</p>
<p>Afterwards, she moved her mouth as if she was talking to us, but we couldn't hear her words. Later, a peasant woman standing next to her relayed it to us. The gist of it was this:</p>
<p>She is from Jiangbei, and her husband works as a tailor in Wusong. This time, because she was about to give birth, there was no one at home, and she had no money, so she came out to look for her husband. But she couldn't find him in Wusong after three days. Today, as she was walking past here, she felt labor pains and gave birth.</p>
<p>I was very moved after listening. I thought: If she had money at home, she would have hired a very famous obstetrician three or four months ago, or she would have gone to XX Hospital last month. And the wet nurse and the baby's new clothes would have been prepared long ago. But she is a poor working-class woman! Alas, the poor woman! And the unfortunate child who is suffering as soon as it is born!</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>A burst of erhu and harmonica sounds came from the dormitory, melodious and joyful, as if celebrating the birth of the child. September 28th, Wusong</p>
<h3>"Service First"</h3>
<p>— Zhi</p>
<p>When I was in school, I often heard the principal, the dean, and many so-called scholars and celebrities give speeches on "youth issues." When they talked about "occupation," I remember they always told us in a sincere and earnest manner: Young people should have the spirit of service when they leave school and go into society to work. They should be able to endure and work faithfully for the happiness of the country and society, and then their future achievements will be limitless. If you only look for a job to eat and make a living, that is too narrow, and even an unreasonable explanation. Because "to work for food" is just a despicable selfish act, and the country and society will never find any benefit from it. "To work for service" is what every young person should firmly remember...</p>
<p>These words, in the first two years after I just walked out of the school gate, I did engrave them deeply in my heart, but for several years, the answer of the facts knows that they are all liars! May I ask: Who can talk about "service first" while risking hunger? They are deceptive liars!</p>
<p>Not long ago, a writer in this magazine talked about "occupation." The meaning is roughly similar to those liars, such as so-called scholars, celebrities, principals, and deans, that I had learned from before. This writer shouted loudly: The meaning of an occupation whose "behavior is caused by seeking living materials" and "whose object is only economic" is too narrow. Therefore, he (of course, this is the writer!) also explained in detail the so-called three basic conditions for finding a job: (1) You must consider your own interests: (2) You must see whether your talents match or not: (3) You must see what your contribution to the general society is. Finally, he also proposed "three aphoristic slogans of "respecting the job," "enjoying the job," and "persistent in the job" to "friends who already have a job and are confident in seeking a job."</p>
<p>I have almost read this masterpiece to the point of rottenness, so I began to speculate that this writer must have opened a room for thirty dollars a day to write this great article, or at least, he is certainly the owner of a western-style house with a south-facing window on the third floor! Otherwise, how could the words be so like sucking on a mint candy, and the air that is exhaled is fragrant and makes you feel that your head is cool and refreshing?</p>
<p>However, the facts are in front of us, and we cannot but admit that this writer's words are also close to joking deception. Let's open our eyes and see, in our society, we can easily find some people who return to China from the United States to study medicine and become politicians, those who study mathematics and physics in Germany and return to China to engage in German translation of politics and economics, and those who study science and return to write novels, and those who study education and return to open factories and run industries, etc. We cannot list them all for a while. If we want to adapt to this writer's condition of "matching talents," or ask about "interest" and "contribution," then this batch of fake politicians, translators, novelists, industrialists, entrepreneurs, etc. must all tighten their trousers belts and prepare to go hungry! (In fact, can we even count how many people don't even have a chance to pretend and are just waiting to go hungry?)</p>
<p>We also see many so-called "friends with jobs" watching their jobs tremblingly like holding a bowl of oil, guarding them with "respect" and "enjoyment," but in fact, they cannot "persist," and they simply have no time to "rest"!</p>
<p>…Our writer absolutely cannot see these things, these ironclad things outside of "rooms for thirty dollars a day" or "south-facing windows on the third floor." But, can we explain them away with the "spirit of service" and the lack of "basic conditions"? "Service first" is just deception and hypocrisy! Only by struggling upward at all costs can we avoid starvation!</p>
<h3>An Ordinary Thing</h3>
<p>— Jing Jia</p>
<p>That day I had something to do at the Sincere Company, so I hopped on the No. 1 tram. The tram was very empty, there were only six people including me. The ticket seller was smoking a cigarette. When the tram passed Carter Road, a young man who looked like a worker got on. He gave the ticket seller some copper coins. The ticket seller didn't give him a ticket, just nodded to him and said, "Friend," thank you. The young man didn't say anything.</p>
<p>When the tram arrived at MaHuo Road, a ticket inspector who the ticket seller called "Chilao" got on the tram when the ticket seller wasn't paying attention. He asked the young man for his ticket first. The ticket seller's face turned white.</p>
<p>The young man looked at the ticket seller, and then looked at the ticket inspector. He generously put his hand into his pocket and fished out a handful of copper coins.</p>
<p>"How much to XX Road?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Where did you get on?" the ticket inspector said.</p>
<p>"XX Road."</p>
<p>"Fourteen fen."</p>
<p>The young man dropped fourteen copper coins into the ticket seller's hand. The ticket inspector walked away.</p>
<p>After the ticket inspector left, the ticket seller returned the money to the young man. I saw tears in his eyes. He said, "Thank you!"</p>
<p>The young man just smiled and put the money back in his pocket.</p>
<p>I got off the tram in front of the Sincere Company. As I was walking down the street, I was pondering this matter. I thought this was "mutual aid"! At least, mutual aid is a virtue. Unexpectedly, there is still this kind of mutual aid between Chinese people! Can China be destroyed?</p>
<p>I decided that I would write a "Theory That China Will Not Be Destroyed."</p>
<p>Amateur Mailbox</p>
<h3>An Illegal and Unpopular Habit</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I love to read the Amateur Mailbox the most because it covers the answers to many social problems and I have gained a lot of knowledge. I would like to express my gratitude to the editor here first.</p>
<p>I have a current problem that I would like to ask you to solve for me. Let me tell you about it below!</p>
<p>I am an apprentice who has studied at a department store. Because I have no brothers and my parents are old, I cannot go to other places to do business. I have to work as a peddler in a certain rubber factory. This is close to my family, and I can often know news from home, and it is convenient to take care of things. So I settle down here, and my parents are also relieved. But recently my parents have raised another problem for me!</p>
<p>Originally, my father had two brothers. My uncle died early and had no descendants, so I inherited the positions of both my father and my uncle when I was sixteen years old. Now I am twenty-eight years old, and my aunt has also passed away. My father cherishes the brotherhood between siblings and wants me to take a second wife and establish separate households. My father has said this to me in person or asked others to tell me several times, and he wants to implement it in the first month of next year!</p>
<p>I think this matter is too important to be taken lightly. I really have very little knowledge about whether there is a legal basis and guarantee for this matter, and whether there will be conflicts between the two families in the future. I simply don't understand things. I must ask you to solve this problem for me, otherwise, I really cannot understand! I have long admired you as the guide and leader of young people. I think you will not dismiss these trivial thoughts! Please give me your advice publicly in the Amateur Mailbox column. I would be very grateful. Respectfully,</p>
<p>Huang Jun respectfully</p>
<p>Editor's Note: In ancient times, our country's patriarchal system did not have a method of inheriting both lineages. It only stipulated that the eldest son could not be without descendants. Therefore, if there are two brothers, the elder brother has no descendants and the younger brother has only one son, then this son of the younger brother should be established as the heir of the elder brother. The one who has a son becomes the one who is without descendants. Later, people felt that this method was unfair, so they changed it. When the above situation is encountered, a method of inheriting both lineages is established. This dual-lineage heir usually marries only one wife. However, unless the children born are still the only heirs, then they continue to inherit both lineages. Otherwise, they are worshipped separately. However, in a very small number of places, there is a custom where this dual-lineage heir can marry two wives (that is, Huang Jun's so-called taking a second wife) to establish separate households. As the custom has been around for a long time, people have even forgotten that it violates reason and law. This custom cannot exist at all because its production is based on an outdated patriarchal system. Since the patriarchal system is considered by us to be non-existent, then its products cannot exist either. Moreover, this custom violates the legal system of one husband and one wife. Although you are a dual-lineage heir, you cannot legally acquire the qualifications of two people. If you remarry, you cannot evade the crime of bigamy in the slightest.</p>

<h3>War and Peace (53) (A Four-Act Play)</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Act Four: Hymn to Peace</p>
<p>Village Chief: No, don't listen to her, sir! They are inciting the masses to make trouble and want to seize the guns of the security team. So, for self-defense, they fired shots into the sky. This person was killed by a stray bullet.</p>
<p>Young Man B: Damn, this bastard can really turn things upside down. He clearly shot and killed someone, and he still says it was a stray bullet.</p>
<p>Japanese Officer: Don't speak. You people are all bad guys who organized the volunteer army to resist our Great Japanese Imperial Army. I know everything. Take them all away. What do you think? (asks the village chief) Is our Japanese soldiers' spirit of maintaining law and order good?</p>
<p>Village Chief: (bowing and cupping his hands) Extremely good, extremely good. I admire it very much!</p>
<p>Young Men (in unison): Bah! You're not even as good as a dog.</p>
<p>Japanese Officer: Don't talk. I know he is a superior Chinese, he is a Chinese gentleman with status, and he won't be wrong. Shouldn't he report you to the Great Japanese Army?</p>
<p>Young Men (in unison): Beat him, beat this traitorous inferior gentry to death!</p>
<p>Village Chief: Listen, sir, listen to what they are saying. They are all a bunch of rioters.</p>
<p>Japanese Officer: You children, why don't you be good citizens? Confucius and Mencius are all your Chinese sages, and they all taught you to be content and do not do immoral things. We Japanese respect Confucius and Mencius very much and practice their doctrines. Do you Chinese people go against the wise words of your ancestors? As for our Imperial Army coming to Guan Nei, we originally came to help you overthrow the bad warlords. But in order to respect the integrity of Chinese territory, we can pick it up and put it down. We will stop the war if we want to stop it, and we don't want to occupy even half of your land. Only the people of our Yamato nation can achieve this spirit of selflessness. There is also one point that you should understand even more. The United States wants to occupy the Yangtze River basin, Britain wants Tibet, France wants Yunnan, and the Soviet Union simply wants to communize all of China. Under these circumstances, your government and people do not have any ability to save themselves. On the other hand, you are resisting the Japanese Empire, which is of the same race and culture, and you are still talking about long-term resistance as if you are joking. Who doesn't know that when your country is about to be destroyed, the only way is to implement the East Asian Monroe Doctrine and resist the aggression of the white race together? Therefore, your organization of volunteer armies in a reckless manner to make things difficult for the Japanese army is not only an extremely stupid act but also a self-inflicted destruction.</p>
<p>Young Man D: We don't want to listen to this bullshit.</p>
<p>Young Men (in unison): We don't want to listen to this bullshit!</p>
<p>Japanese Officer: You are all a bunch of pigs who don't listen to good words. Come on, take them all away, damn it!</p>
<p>(The young men refuse to go, and the Japanese soldiers beat them with their gun butts.)</p>
<p>Village Chief: Then, sir, can the two guns of the security team be returned to them?</p>
<p>Japanese Officer: No, they are killing people in the countryside with guns. That won't do. We will take them back to the county. Let the county magistrate come and collect them in person later.</p>

<h3>The Marriage of Tarzan and the Wildcat</h3>
<p>— Si Ban</p>
<p>Johnny Weissmuller Divorces to Show Love; Lupe Vélez Treats Marriage as a Game</p>
<p>Johnny Weissmuller, everyone knows that he is the protagonist in "Tarzan the Ape Man". He is a world-renowned swimmer. His healthy and majestic physique is envied by everyone. Lupe Vélez is the famous Mexican Wildcat! When she first came to Hollywood, she was completely a wild child, almost the same as "Tarzan". They have many similarities in temperament. So some people guessed that if these two wild people were matched together, wouldn't they be a perfect couple! Now this ideal actually has the hope of being realized. Not only is there hope, but it can also be said that it will definitely be successful in the future.</p>
<p>Lupe Vélez herself has already announced it. She said: "When Johnny Weissmuller gets his freedom, we can get married." What is this, isn't it equivalent to a declaration of engagement? But it must be remembered that Lupe was originally a wild child, and her bold words may be just casual talk. But everyone hopes that she won't say it today and forget it tomorrow. Lupe Vélez and Gary Cooper had a romance before, which was probably even more intense than her current relationship with Weissmuller. Her and Gary's wedding date was already set; everything was prepared: the place was a small town in the deep mountains of California; they had decided to go there secretly together. According to local law, unmarried couples must report to the authorities three days before they can officially get married. They went to the mountains together and spent three days. Who knew that on the day of the wedding, she suddenly changed her mind and didn't want to get married. Gary, because she was an uninhibited wild child, didn't argue with her and they separated in a huff. Is she going to play this trick again now?</p>
<p>It is said that this time Lupe Vélez genuinely loves Weissmuller. But Weissmuller is a married man. His wife is called Bobbe Arnst. But Lupe fell in love with him, probably because of his strong and majestic physique. She has rejected many wealthy men; she no longer accepts their diamond bracelets and silver fox fur coats. She often approached Johnny Weissmuller. Therefore, three female reporters saw Lupe ignoring her at the MGM studio. When Lupe found out about this, she waited for the three female reporters to come and asked them, "Why don't you want to talk to me?" The three female reporters scolded her bluntly. They said: "A woman like you is too shameless. You are destroying Johnny Weissmuller's family. We look down on women like you." Lupe immediately sent someone to invite Johnny Weissmuller, and in front of the three female reporters, she said to Johnny, "From now on, I can no longer see you. I cannot bear the guilt of destroying your family for you."</p>
<p>Lupe Vélez now brings up this matter and she can't help but laugh. She said that at that time she didn't really love Johnny, just had a slight connection with him. But since the three female reporters reminded her, she felt that Johnny was a really cute person. She often said, "This is really strange. People tell you not to do something, and you insist on doing it. It's like a child, you tell him that this thing is not tasty, and he insists on eating it. Hollywood tells me that I can't love Johnny Weissmuller, but I really fell in love with him. In fact, this idea was originally put in my mind by those three female reporters."</p>
<p>Now Johnny Weissmuller has really divorced his wife, and he has even traveled to New York with Lupe Vélez. They were very happy when they were together. But it is not known when they will actually get married. If she changes her mind again, it would be too unfair to the "Ape Man's" efforts to divorce and woo her.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "The Night of Terror" Puppets of Fate</h3>
<p>— Ling Hong</p>
<p>In any case, the author of this film is very serious about the production of the film. Although because of the mediocrity of the story, this film cannot become a valuable work.</p>
<p>There are several points in the performance that are worth noting here.</p>
<p>1.  The prisoners who minted counterfeit coins escaped from prison, and in the dim night, the police searched for the prisoners. Although the smog at the time was as thick as the night at sea, making it impossible to feel that this was in a bustling place, the picture was very beautiful. In addition, the constant sound of police sirens and the occasional barking of dogs further increased the solemn tone. The prisoners escaped, the police pursued, and the figures were blurred. 丨丨I am annoyed that this should be the most outstanding scene.</p>
<p>2.  The train accident, the blazing fire, the painful cries of people in the disaster. At the same time, it also depicts Dr. Monroe's murder, and the dying struggles of the murdered. The close-up of the escaped prisoner's terrifying and courageous face as he peered at the murder through the window. These, these, force that tense scene. The Montage between these pictures is very noteworthy.</p>
<p>The above are the best achievements of this film.</p>
<p>Originally, it is difficult for every work to be consistently praised from beginning to end. As long as there are some advantages, the work can be enhanced. However, the most important thing is that the entire part is well matched. If there are only a few advantages and the rest are very weak, then it is still inevitably a failed work, and even its unique achievements are easily ignored by the audience. Here we can point out the most important shortcomings, such as the conversation between Li Jiat and at the club. The heavy dialogue, sitting solemnly and talking for four or five minutes, is simply more mechanical than a stage play. When it is shown in non-English-speaking places, for audiences who cannot fully understand English, it is like listening to a story in hot weather, which can easily make people doze off. In addition, there is also a long passage after Gilbert is released from prison. Using dialogue to explain the progress of the play is truly the stupidest way. If compared with Pabst's "Die Büchse der Pandora", there is a world of difference. The dialogue in "Die Büchse der Pandora" is truly extremely concise. When the queen and the officer play chess, there are only a few lines, and that most brilliant scene is unforgettable forever. Everyone knows that the strength of sound films is definitely not to move dramas from the stage to the screen. Chaplin's dubbing in "City Lights" intentionally matched the dialogue when the statue was unveiled with that strange sound (he told Shaw that because his words could not be heard by the audience). Isn't this the most powerful refutation of complicated dialogue?</p>
<p>In addition, in small places, such as Li Jiat tearing the carpet to escape, it shows the author's cleverness, but at most it teaches the audience to laugh instinctively. He is like the last critical scene, letting the police come to the rescue, it is really too ordinary.</p>
<p>On average, generally speaking, this is an ordinary performance after all. No matter how careful the director is, no matter how well several main actors can pass by, at best, it is just above the horizontal line.</p>
<p>As for the structure of the story, I think its main flaw should be blamed on the original novel. We see that in every detective novel, the villains get their due retribution, and the detectives show their great powers and are very happy. Precisely because of his great pleasure, the detective novel has a close connection with modern society.</p>
<p>Here we see that the so-called villains actually call the police station and ask the detective to meet at a certain time and place. It is clearly asking the police to come and arrest them. It is simply extremely stupid. Is there such a strange thing in the world? There are other ridiculous things, but I can't remember them for a while.</p>
<p>As for saying "... Gilbert's murder and suicide, Monroe's misstep and worries, and Jigat's punishment of violence and eradication of evil, all have the wonderful effect of enlightening people. It is really a good work that warns the world, criticizes current malpractices, and benefits people's hearts." If this is the case, then the value of this film is naturally remarkable! But what benefits have we gained? I think the audience will definitely laugh.</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3>Review of "Drifting"</h3>
<p>— Lu Yi</p>
<p>"Drifting" writes about an unfortunate woman who encounters misfortune everywhere, drifting like an autumn leaf, and finally dying lonely. Regarding this subject matter, I think it is still acceptable as long as it is handled correctly. However, the performance of "Drifting" is a bit disappointing to us. From the time Xiu Zhen escaped from the countryside, she found a life, although she was falsely insulted by Fu Zhongqing, but this led to her cohabitation with college student Ding Zhenping. This story narration does not make the audience sympathize with this drifting woman at all, but instead makes them feel that she is happy. It was not until she was evicted by the landlord while sick and died that the audience let out a sigh. It can be seen that this plot is not enough to move the audience.</p>
<p>However, we cannot therefore say that the plot has nothing to do with society, such as wanting to sell the daughter-in-law after the son dies; thinking that the daughter-in-law has a bad fate because the son died; all can be found in today's society. This kind of bad habit still exists deeply in the folk. However, the acquaintance between college student Ding Zhenping and Xiu Zhen is very far-fetched.</p>
<p>In the performance, the two scenes of Xiu Zhen dying and the classmates looking for Zhenping are very tense, and because of this climax of the whole play, "Drifting" is enhanced a lot.</p>
<p>Using flowers to imply Xiu Zhen's fate, and using a overturned fish bowl to imply that Zhenping was forbidden by his father, these two points are the director's cleverness, but it is a pity that the use of this symbolic technique is incomprehensible to most of the audience.</p>
<p>The lighting of the photography is generally very good, and the movement of the camera is also very appropriate, but there are fewer close-up shots, otherwise, the impression given to the audience will be even deeper.</p>
<p>The subtitles are very appropriate except for a few more "the next day", and the subtitles of the dialogue are also concise. In short, "Drifting" is slightly more advanced in technique than other films from Tianyi.</p>
<p>The actors Hu Shan, Lu Lixia, and Ma Roufen are all competent. Xiao Zhengzhong's personality is not suitable, and Ma Dongwu's performance is a bit excessive.</p>
<h3>A Loophole in Drifting</h3>
<p>— Yao Zu</p>
<p>The latter part of "Fei Xu," "Drifting," starring Hu Shan, officially premiered at the Beijing Grand Theater on the 22nd. After I visited, I discovered a not small loophole, so I wrote it out:</p>
<p>Xiu Zhen avoided going to Shanghai from the countryside to find a job through a job broker. As usual, the rules of Shanghai job brokers are: "No recommendation without relatives or friends as guarantors." The boss of the job broker and Xiu Zhen were neither relatives nor friends, and she only said one thing: "I want to entrust you to recommend a job." (The general meaning is like this.) The boss of the job broker immediately invited her in and agreed to her request. I think this is a bit too far from reality.</p>
<p>(I think Mr. Yao Zu's heart is too careful, but this is also a small opinion, so I will publish it for him. Editor)</p>
<h3>Talking About "Spring Tide" and "Crane Sound Communication"</h3>
<p>— Yin Zhong</p>
<p>The long-publicized "Spring Tide" actually appeared on the spring Shenpu. The general movie fans who have been looking forward to it and waiting anxiously can now fulfill their desire to appreciate the excellent film. This is such a happy thing for them! 丨What's more, it is in such a clear and pleasant autumn?</p>
<p>Yes, "Spring Tide" is the first sound film made by Chinese people themselves after the sound film trend swept into the Chinese film industry. This is indeed a page worth a special mention in the history of Chinese cinema.</p>
<p>However, the content of this film's story still does not escape the flavors of "sexy," "sensual," "mysterious," and "romantic"... In other words, it is another film full of decadent colors, while also overflowing with sentimental tones. Of course, it is to let people recognize the absurd debauchery of "bourgeois" women in the city and the ease with which weak-willed young people are tempted, leading to tragic consequences: 丨 This kind of film that exposes the sins of the "bourgeois" is not incorrect in consciousness, but it has not fulfilled its other more important tasks besides this. There have been many such stories in previous films. It is a bit tiring to have such performances now, right?</p>
<p>That being said, the birth of this film is still the experimental material of the "Crane Sound Communication" radio, so no matter what the content of this film is, it cannot become a problem, right? As for whether the result of this radio experiment was successful?</p>
<p>Although I have not seen how its things are constructed, I did go and listen to the first sound film "Spring Tide" made by this Chinese-made radio. I carefully listened to its sound and felt that it was really high and low, too uneven; in some places, there was originally a dialogue between people on the film, but what came into our eardrums was not people talking; if we closed our eyes, we would suspect that a pair of cats were fighting! I cannot write out the other unlike sounds in detail.</p>
<p>"Crane Sound Communication" has obviously not succeeded yet. But since we know that this is the first experiment, based on usual experience, this is also an inevitable phenomenon; the greater the project or career, the more inevitable its failure. Therefore, we cannot use too harsh intentions to blame this first domestic film radio. Moreover, Mr. Yan Heming, the maker of this radio, does not know how much effort and money he has spent on it. This is enough to show his painstaking efforts.</p>
<h3>Film Novel Peach and Plum Fragrance Paddy the Next Best Thing (3)</h3>
<p>— Xing Sheng</p>
<p>Paddy knows that her sister's lover is Jake Hamlin, but she can't get her sister to agree to marry Lawrence. At first, she thought Lawrence was the most handsome man in the world, but since he saw through her lie, she hated him in her heart. She and Jake Hamlin discussed how to prevent her sister from marrying Lawrence; but Lawrence proposed and Irene agreed. Paddy asked Jake, "Why did my sister agree to him?" Jake said, "Alas, you don't know. Your father owes a lot of debts..." Paddy said: (What? Because Lawrence has money, you steal? She sells herself? This is too outrageous! I must find a way to stop their marriage. I can do anything. I can lie, and everything."</p>
<p>But the situation changed so embarrassingly for Paddy. Old Captain Adair already owed Lawrence a lot of money! Those creditors were already unwilling to give him anything without cash. The cigar seller sent some high-quality cigars; Old Captain Adair touched his own pocket; Lawrence saw it next to him and took out a few banknotes to pay for him. Paddy watched coldly, wondering how to repay the money her father owed. One day, the market day arrived. She had four lovely piglets and wanted to sell them to repay Lawrence's money. But at the market, Lawrence and Irene also came. Her four piglets were to be sold for nine pounds. Lawrence offered her six and a half pounds, actually teasing her. But Paddy was angry, and she said, "Is your money worth more than other people's?" Lawrence saw that she was angry and hurriedly said, "Paddy, why are you angry, I'm not killing your price. If you sell it, I'm willing to pay twenty pounds." Paddy said, "I don't care about your money." She eventually sold it to someone else for her price of nine pounds.</p>
<p>That night, Lawrence was shocked because Paddy suddenly returned the nine pounds she got from selling the piglets. She said, "This is the money my father owes you." Lawrence was about to argue with her when Captain Adair came in again. He said to Lawrence: "Good boy, do you have money on you? Four or five pounds is enough." Lawrence handed him the nine pounds that Paddy had returned to him, and he handed it to a creditor who was waiting at the door.</p>
<p>Paddy's eyes were burning with anger, and she said to her father angrily, "Dad, what is this?" Her father said, "I bought a horse and didn't have the money to pay for it at the time." Paddy said, "Don't you have a horse? Why do you want to buy a horse?" The old man smiled: Do I have a horse? I have ten horses! I also have a library; can't I buy books if I have a library?" Paddy shrugged, shook her head, sighed, and walked away. Since being stimulated by this, thinking that Lawrence deliberately ridiculed her, she hated Lawrence even more. But she still couldn't stop him from marrying Irene. (To be continued)</p>
