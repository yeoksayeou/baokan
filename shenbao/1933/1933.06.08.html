<h3 id="c38">四强公約下之歐洲 <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>明</p>
<p>歐洲政治危機。自本年春初德國由希特勒執政以來。愈益加深。戰爭巨禍。幾有難於避免之勢。且德意兩國以不滿於凡爾賽和約之故。其對法及對中歐三小國與波蘭之外交策略。皆趨一致。一九一四年大戰爆發之前。歐洲之噴火口僅有巴爾幹半島一處今則由但澤自由市以至巴納特等地。莫不濃烟四噴顯有爆發之徵象也。英首相羅馬之行。其任務即在於穩定歐洲政局。圖世界經濟恐慌局面之轉換。於是四月三十一日乃有四强公約重建歐洲之主張發表。</p>
<p>該公約之主要用意。端在緩和歐洲之政治不安與德意兩國之不平。擬以和平手段改訂凡爾賽和約。掃除西歐最大之不穩因素。而企圖軍備縮小之成功。與世界經濟會議之進展。公約第二條。內有「英法意德四國確認各國家間有發生糾紛之情勢當以國聯規約爲準據。改訂各和平條約爲原則。但須在國際聯盟機構之內。增進互惠之利益。以謀利害協調。」是則爲法蘭西素常之主張也。第三條對「德國要求軍備平等權。須國際軍備縮小會議有相當成功。乃得逐步實現。」是亦與法國之主張相合。蓋前此英美法德意五强國爲軍縮之指導者。及德國因爭軍備平等權而退出。軍縮會議事實上逐僅有英法意三國。即以西歐關係論。設無德國。亦成僵局。是以「逐步諒解」之議。非特挽回德國再來參加且希望匃·奧·與保加利亞共同諒解。第四條有四强共同相約對政治的或非政治的。無論爲歐洲或歐洲以外一切問題。凡與四國有關者。皆當取一致行動。則此一公約之效能。或將擴充至「洛加洛條約」之上。對歐洲以外之問題。亦將採取共同行動。其內含意義在豫備展開政治上之企圖。有重新分割世界市場之嚴重意義。亦可想見矣。然而茲四强者。苟能眞正共同一致。歐洲當前矛盾。固有克服之可能。無如實際問題。决不如理想之簡單。而對立衝突之激劇。尤不易於樽俎間消除之也。吾人試察歐洲現勢。自大戰而後。德奧匃保各戰敗國家。各受和平條約之覊勒。无日无時不思破壞此鐵鎖。以圖雄飛。德國在一九一三年當時。西里西亞各種鑛產年額。煤炭有四千萬噸。鐵鑛十萬噸。鋅鉛百萬噸。三十七座鎔鑛爐生產。銑鐵六十萬噸。鋼鐵百萬噸其他機械化學工業。皆稱極盛。伹以西里西亞被割。金屬工業。遂受重大打擊。對法復仇。固不可能工業復興。亦遭阻滯加以迥廊問題。使德人愈難忘情於軍備。此則德人所一日不能。忘亦即希特勒之煽動。的以能迅速奏功也。匃牙利舊土。旣被削於南斯拉夫及羅馬尼亞兩國。其欲改訂國境取回巴納特等地之欲念。與日俱增。故與德意諸國之團結。亦愈緊密。至於意大利原爲戰勝國之一。但憤分配不均。又欲穩持亞得利亞海上覇權。故對隔岸亞爾巴尼亞與塔爾馬提亞。須完全受意支配。不肯放鬆。遂與南斯拉夫相水火。是所謂意大利之東漸政策。須以改訂中歐國境。乃有實現之可能。因此德意之對外政策。多腦河聯邦。與巴爾幹聯邦之組織。兩者利益相似。而趨接近。取同一步驟以對法·波·及小協約國。在另一方面戰勝之法蘭西。對德仇懼之念。亦具長久歷史。一時不易拔除「安全保障」之要求。乃爲法國國際外交之中心政策。波蘭無異爲法國之同盟國。捷克·南斯拉夫·羅馬尼亞。又皆直接割取匃牙利舊領。假令凡爾賽和約而果改訂則小協約國之權益。將受危害。故三國結合共制德意。且法國波蘭。在勢在理。皆必爲彼等之助。則德意之雄心。未見其能立即實現也。</p>
<p>此次四强公約。即令平穩簽定以內含矛盾過多即如上項所述。已足以障害歐洲之和平。挑動世界之戰禍而有餘。則四强公約也者。在表面上敷衍和平。或足使世界經濟會議席上。减少政治糾紛然其實際病狀。仍如往昔。該公約之最大效用。不過等於一服鎭靜劑。使驚惶不定之歐洲。略得一時之安定而已。</p>

<p>意英法準備簽字</p>
<p>惟德國仍抱疑慮</p>
<p>巴黎　四强公約之半官式節要如下、叙文聲明主要宗旨在以更大效力給予國聯盟約所規定之手續、而附以四强所决定皆不得侵犯他國權利之約定、公約條文凡五、㈠英·法·意·德·依允協作、㈡規定互換關於適用國聯盟約條文、尤其是於第十條（維持土地現狀）、第十六條（制裁侵略）、與第十九條（修改條約）之意見、㈢規定如軍縮會議不成、四强須彼此商榷以謀懸案之解、决㈣四强可考慮彼等在歐洲有共同利益之經濟問題、㈤規定此約有效時間爲十年、如在第八年底未有廢約通知、則此約得再賡續十年、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>羅馬　四强國是否均皆參加公約、在數小時以內似尙難明瞭、德國要求將該約序文略加修改、法國駐意大使儒佛納爾現已將德國要求送巴黎請訓、羅馬方面希望德國對於公約形式上之異議、不至阻止公約於今日簽字、一般人盼望意相墨索里尼在參院宣言極爲焦急、意相必俟對於公約各種異議消除以後、方可在參院發表宣言也、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>羅馬　英·法·德·意四强公約就意首相墨索里尼今日在參院開會時之演詞觀之、似日內即可締成、據意相稱談判已至在一種意想上公約必可締成之階段、如屬必要、渠將於明日發言云、同時巴黎閣議今日已諭令駐意法大使接受目前草約、此草約亦爲英國所可接受、德國同意之通告不日亦可望接到、届時此公約即可正式立、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　德國因四國公約內容與意首相墨索里尼提出之原稿完全不同、尤其因未載有關於德國平等要求之滿意倏欵、故對該約仍抱疑慮、或將拒絕簽字、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>巴黎　墨索里尼所擬保障歐洲和平之四强公約、其盡諾日期殆不在遠、因英·意·法·三國旣已接受此約、德國未必公然反對也、聞公約第三條涉及軍縮者、在其新形式中極緩和之能事僅聲明如軍縮失敗、則簽約國將集議　時局而已、據路透社柏林電稱、法政府允於公約簽字之消息傳到柏林爲時已晚、故交易所未及受其影響、據柏林官塲意見意相之計書屢經法國修正、已失去原來性質云、（六日路透電）</p>

<p>一文爲荒畑所著、論外次有田之辭職、實因與內田外相對於處理中國問題及日滿俄交涉事件意見不洽所致、文內謂外務省當局之意見不和、已非一朝一夕、迨日本退出國聯問題出現、此種牴牾、遂益尖銳化、外務省高級官員多數對日本宣告脫離、獨受軍閥指揮者則不然、軍界與外務省之意見相左、已盡人皆知、當滿洲事變發生之初、雙方積不相能、軍界因不復能容忍幣原之溫和外交手腕、劍拔弩張、不啻與之公然决裂、此所以幣原乃見機而退也、著者譏笑松岡在日內瓦所變最後一套戲法、即表示日本現處於防杜中國赤化可能性之第一道防線是、又國聯如陷日本於孤立地位、則安南印度埃及無一可安全處於帝國主義權力之下一言、亦爲松岡所發、其言愚誒可笑、大足揭明日本對滿之整個政策、著者之意、滿洲事務實昭示吾人日本之外交問題、乃變相的內政問題、自歐戰以還、軍備屢經縮减、陸軍省之勢力大弱、各政黨之權力、則繼長增高遂致相形見絀、於是軍界乃注全力以與歴任之外相爲抗、而幣原之外交政策、主張與歐美合作、以减輕軍備之担負、尤爲軍人所反對、强迫日本退出國聯之步伐、實不外乎爭求保有今日軍閥暫時所享之政治勢力而已、文末謂陸軍參謀部（荒畑並未述及該機關、蓋檢查員不加許可也、故荒畑僅以某機關代之、然一望可知其意之所在、）之外交政策、現控制日本之政府議會及一切發言機關、而將內田外相由柔和的橡皮洋囡囡變爲鋼的機器人、軍閥不特獨攬外交大權、且自空前之大豫算案中支用巨欵、擴張軍備、日本民衆苟不從速覺悟、齊力反抗則恐日本將渝於風雨飄摇之中云云另一文爲米本所著、文内竊怪国人是否實知目下正遭遇一嚴重困難、不僅對於一二國實際與全世界相抗衡、然而稍負名望之新聞記者、或發行人、罕有充分膽量、在此國家外交轉移點之重要關頭、敢於堅决反對政府現行政策、而將長行此種急進政策之危機、告知國人者、誠令有一二新聞記者懷此「危險思想」、亦無報紙敢爲披露、雖然、據彼所確知、不能謂日本人人贊同目下之所謂國策者、例如大崎即堅决反對者之一、（按大崎自日本設立政黨政府以來、即任國會議員、曾一度任司法大臣、久居英國、新方歸國、）再如橫濱茂木公司前總董茂木、亦極懷疑當局現行政策之是否得計、渠以爲當此帝國主義的發展之結果、歐洲業已肅淸、而在亞洲及其他各處亦正由英美爲之徐徐淸除之時、乃日本復圖在東亞大陸施行一極險惡的新方式之帝國主義、渠認日本有中國印度等方圖自興之民族爲毘鄰、刻正處於極困難地位、其行動必須極端審愼、庶不致貽後日之悔憾、渠詰問在東亞樹立門羅主義以對抗民族間天然發展之地域主義之是否得計、而致疑於此種門羅主義與急進政策之是否將反響於世界和平、以爲當此中國印度正循資本主義進展之際、日本樹立此種門羅主義、即令世界列强袖手旁觀、而在日本亦不知是否有利、渠又謂日本之退出國聯、在此時其意義即可視爲日本之外交與世界外交及世界輿論相抗衡、此舉並不能有助於中日爭執之眞正解决、且在中國留處國聯之時、渠實懷疑日本依循現行方針而欲有利的解决中日糾紛、在實際上是否可行、渠嗣乃詰問日本能否孤立於其餘世界之外、能否繼續漠視非戰公約</p>
<p>與九國公約、至於無盡期、能否施行其大陸政策、一如己意不顧他人、渠對此深爲懷疑、揣想一旦日本被迫與設備優良之國家作戰、則處於目下之孤立地位、直無異與全世界作戰、日本縱可得一時之勝利、但歐洲大戰旣已昭示吾人現代戰爭、决勝於經濟力與持久力切望一般自信日本可以戰勝眞正第一等强國者、於此三致意焉彼負責當局、對於國家經濟力量、固已有精密調查無疑但即具此經濟力、能否確信其定能長期支持而不疲、或以爲日本之實業、僅得滿洲之原料、已足以自給、但究誰能證實此語之可靠、渠以爲目下不無希望戰爭者、但警告日本之欲戰者、必須準備有陸沉之禍而後可、渠信在於日本戰爭之結果、唯有使其民窮財盡、致現有之社會秩序、完全崩潰而已、米本最後主張中日合作打破中國今日藩鎭割據之局、以爲理想上之中日關係、唯有兩大民族之經濟活動能互相尊敬、互相需要、並有相當諒解而後可獲致、並承認此種理想的中日關係之實現、至少須在數十年之後、在此期間、日本應盡力與其他民族視前更竭誠合作、完全拋棄東方卑劣之觀念云云、</p>

<p>最短期內可以成立</p>
<p>中央制定組織大綱</p>
<p>平訊、北平政務整理委員會自黄郛受命於上月十七日來平之後、屈指兼旬矣、初來之時、因軍事關係、不能不亟其所亟、故會務未暇布置、每日所接見之賓客、亦幾盡係軍公會中人物、至各要員中如黄紹雄則時在何應欽處商量軍事、王克敏於前日傷目後臥病協和、于學忠·張志潭·王揖唐·張伯苓·王樹翰·在津曾特到平來唔湯爾和·劉哲·魯蕩平·宋哲元·傅作義·亦間至南海丁文江不日南下、轉程赴美、於會事似不及注意、周作民在滬催歸、王伯羣病足上海、李石曾張溥泉恩克巴圖、張厲生均不在此、韓復榘徐永昌因主席職務繁重、恐須開會時再來然音問頻通、消息時至也、迨停戰協定告成、華北有由軍事而轉入政治之趨向、於是政委會遂立時積極籌備、擬於短時期間宣告成立、</p>
<p>溯政委會沿革、實由從前之政治分會、以至張漢卿時代之政務委員而來、惟政務委員會對軍方人物亦多網羅、迨軍分會成立後、於是除省主席外軍人多屬於軍分會、政委會遂成一完全政治之機關矣、政委會負整理華北政治之責任、且爲委員制、而組織法上又以委員長爲重心、故內部組織實有精密研究之必要、在先政委會外另有財委會、今財委會已併入爲財政處、又在先政委會有政務機要蒙藏等處、今亦另設政務處、按組織法設政務·財務·秘書·三處財務有財委會之前身、且即爲王克敏之副委員長、故人事早全、不成問題政務處長王樹翰、前曾來平、但處務尙待討論、至政委會本身事務則端在秘書處、蓋財務政務用以對所屬省市而會內一切事務統屬之秘書處、秘書長何其鞏、　任北平市長、於此間情形甚熟組織之際、大約擬定處內分設四科、一文書·一總務·一交際·一編譯·至參議廳則直屬於委員會、凡參議·顾問·咨議·專員·均屬之、其主要任務則爲研究·調查·編訂·審核·等事務、</p>
<p>政委會爲行政院駐平之最高機關、所屬者四省二市職權不爲不大、然此爲淩空之機關一切措施各有地方負責、當局不過發縱指示、决疑定計而已、至其惟一要務、尤在應付危機、團結各派、故自直的方面言之、似屬尊而不親、自橫的方面觀之、又爲視而且尊者也、惟向來中國政治上派别紛歧、人事復雜、故調劑與周旋均屬不易也、</p>
<p>政委會之地點現正布置於外交部之西樓、將來成立各科、自當遷入、在未成立之前、少數人治事即在中南海豐澤園、此爲舊時帝后宴息之所、由來已久、改革以後、屬於總統府、或爲承宣司禮官處、或爲接見外賓之用、或爲國務卿秘書室、至革命軍北伐、改都南京、改屬於公園、全部開放、其中南海事務所即設於此、至黄郛來平、始借作行轅、蓋何應欽住居仁堂、同在一處尤稱便利、豐澤園房屋不多、其前曰頣年堂、後曰含和堂、會未成立之前、即在行轅辦公、於此寂寞幽蒨之老屋、復賓客盈庭、少復舊觀矣</p>
<p>政委會之組織大鋼、業經中央制定、明令公布、茲將原文録之如次第一條、行政院爲整理北方各省市之政務起見、特設行政院駐平政務整理委員會、第二條、本會設委員二十三人、就中指定一人爲委員長、其人選由行政院長提請中央政治會議通過後國民政府特派之、第三條、委員長綜理本會會務、第四條、本會每月開會一次、由委員長召集、其議事規則另定之、委員長認爲必要時、得召集臨時會議第五條、本會設左列三處、㈠秘書處、㈡政務處、㈢財務處第六條、本會設秘書長一人、掌理秘書處事務、設政務主任一人、掌理政務處事務、財務主任一人、掌理財務處事務、必要時各處得酌設副主任、其組織細則另定之、第七條、本會視事務之需要、得酌設參議、諮議·專員·第八條、本會在不牴觸中央法令範圍以內、得擬定單行規程、呈請行政院核准施行、第九條、本會辦事細則另定之、第十條、本會暫行組織大綱、自公布之日施行（六日）</p>

<p>顧問先生：這裏的華僑，因在祖國被土豪劣紳勒索被迫而來的十有四五，有賺得錢回家後，仍遭敲剥而來的亦十有二三。因這樣，引起我進進維谷。我是生在一個常被土劣魚肉的鄕村，於民國十八年冬，曾被城廂的劣紳，通同軍隊，把我綁夫！後給他一萬元，才得脫險！因此，竟致家業破產！債台高築！乃不得已，離别年過半百的雙親，和弱小的妻兒，南來謀生。幸天不負我，初到砂勝越，卽得朋友的介紹，得任相當的職業。待遇不醋，薪水也有可觀。但迄今已經四年有奇，我前所負的債務已陸續還淸，現任的職業也經届期，此時本應回家省親，惟恐此去仍遭土劣的毒手！實屬令人觀望徘徨？但此處又没有中國領事，可請出張護照，我又不是個智識界，能去向各方的僑委會請求保護。所以不敢决然歸去。請先生代我設法一個安全罷</p>
<p>答：你的家產被國內土劣匪軍共了去，跑到南洋找到職業，依記者想來，還是就在那邊生活下去也好，所謂「祖國」有何令人依戀之價値：東北四省棄如敝屣（在事實，不在口頭），又那有心情顧到飄流海外的華僑？更那有心思顧及你這一個孤伶的，不甚愛惜的窮酸？至於我們，慚愧得很，也是愛莫能助，只有望你自己努力奮鬭罷。</p>

<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>無形的損失，的國貨年中的大敵，不但是國貨年的大敵，凡是國貨工廠，國貨公司，乃至經營一切國貨事業的，都是受到無形損失的大虧。讀者不信，吾來舉出幾種。</p>
<p>㈠好好一個工廠，管理者於人事問題太不研究，駕馭工人不得法，弄到工人由　望而抱怨，而憤恨於是煤多燒了。馬達汽油白費了，材料浪費了，物品暗暗地出擋了，明明生意很　　，利息很豐厚，可是結果反賠了錢，原因何在？卽在此無形的損失。</p>
<p>㈡好好一個國貨商店，起先一般店員，個個精神飽滿，興致很高的生意，管理者帶了近視眼鏡，只圖眼前，只顧片面，待遇苛了一些，一般店員便做出了「晚爺面孔」，懶洋洋的來對付顧客，顧客問一句，他勉强答一句，顧客要一件，他勉强拿一件。原來應付顧客是面面俱到，無話不答，無件不問的當時顧客只要一樣貨物，被他問得高興，倒買了三四樣物品的。現在店員心理，只望顧客少問，免得麻煩，免得討厭。在管理者方以爲處置得宜，可是你爲什麼不去看看你部下的一般晚爺面孔？趕快來放遠些眼光，擴大些度量呢？這也是無形的損失。</p>
<p>㈢一個廠，一家店，一個機關，一切損失，往往在没有一種計劃，一種預算。　一件印刷品，印了許許多多，結果把很大的一筆印刷費，丢到字紙簏中作破報紙出賣。還有一種機關，天天把不相干的東西，橫印堅印，人家丢在字紙簏，他倒費了工夫，傷了物力，做這冤枉事。試問何益？還有自來水亂開，電燈濫放，夥友學生以爲這是公家的，那裏管得，然而這筆無形的損失，何可勝計？</p>
<p>㈣要發財，樣樣可以做得，爲什麼東不做，西不做，偏偏要販賣日貨？爲了你一個人要發財，結果害了國貨廠商，害了社會經濟，害了國家實力，在他以爲偷偷摸摸，神不知，鬼不覺，只要騙得過人，賺得到錢，此外那裏管得？可憐一個上海市，一天到晚，一年到頭，被這般混賬東西，去做没良心的勾當。這筆無形的損失，請那一位算學家來一算呢？</p>

<p>一個國家旣經正式頒行的關稅稅則，本來是已天經地義的成立，用不到說什麼擁護∶∶∶等名辭來促進實行的。但是，柔弱的我國，在此次新行稅則初經頒布之下，却即有人謀圖橫加阻撓的情事發現，强蠻無理，殊堪痛心，本來，我國因數十年來關稅的不自主，重重束縛，帝國主義者端賴以一切不平等條約爲護符，儘以剩餘的生產，全部的推到我國內各地來，以最低的稅率，謀最高的利潤，努力傾銷，搜刮榨取，但於他方面又復提高出口稅收，使我國國產貨品輸出的飽受打擊，對外貿易的日益衰落，造成入超數量的空前激增，破壞整個工商業前途的發展，而漸成喧賓奪主的局面，現下我國外市塲的低落。種種財政經濟上的恐慌，一言以蔽之，可以說都是歷年來關稅的影響，驚人漏巵的斵喪，我們歷溯往迹，自然不堪回首，現在政府旣已收回自主有年，本年五月六日又是强迫簽訂片面利益的中日互惠關稅協定滿期的一天，瞻望世界各國正在高稅壁壘，驅逐外貨，使進口貨無立足餘地的時候，那麼我們這次新稅則的實行，最低限度當然也可希望掃除舊有障碍，發揚國貨銷路，（其實，這次新關稅之規訂，雖略有增加，但較之世界各國，相距猶遠。）但，這狡猾陰險的日本帝國主義，他却不顧公理，還圖要挾，最近盛傳本埠日商各路聯合會召集大會，聚衆會議，草成請顧文書，交日使有吉，轉呈我國當局，提出無理要求，荒廖舉動，不法行爲，實已公然暴露無遺，夫關稅自主，乃爲世界各國通例，稅則頒行，係屬內政範圍，豈號稱文明（？）之日本，猶不明此國際常理耶？蔑視國權，居心何測，此而可忍，孰不可忍，現雖經國貨產銷合作協會曁各國貨團體迭電中央，羣起擁護，然凡屬國民，尤應一致奮起，誓爲後盾，深知稅率增减，足爲提倡國貨抵制仇貨之最大關鍵，亦即實業消長之區紐，生命有關，豈可忽視，爲自身爭生存，爲國家爭主權，務望政府依理駁斥，嚴行拒絕，貫澈初衷，毌稍退讓，以維主權而培國本，那麼當然不惟我國貨前途之福利，亦即爲整個民生國計經濟復興的基礎</p>

<p>— 柯定盦</p>
<p>「貨眞價實」這句話，雖然是出諸舊商業家之口；可是時代前的新商業家，也不可不奉爲圭臬的。譬如一家米店，你售出的米價錢平衡，無論白粳或糙粳，祇要人家買去煮飯，漲性好，雜質少，那麼人家總相信你，以後的食米，不會到别家去買了，看了上述的例子，這；「貨眞價實」四個字，可以看出它的效力。</p>
<p>上海是個繁盛的都市，市肆櫛比，人烟稠密，較諸其他著名的都市，有過之無不及，所以從事國貨事業的人，也都在上海設廠生產，人利推銷，差不多可以說；「中國著保的工廠，都聚集在上海」。</p>
<p>不知道第一個作俑的人，究竟是誰？丨丨恕我不能考出它的來源，丨丨就是那創造；「大廉價」的人，當他創造的時候，我也知道是因爲市面不好，借着：「大廉價」來作號召，果然在報紙上露布了：「大廉價」的消息之後，它們的營業，正是出乎意料，比較平常日子，營業的總數，超出了幾倍，這當然是要歸功於；「大廉價」了。</p>
<p>「賺錢」，是商人的一個最普遍的想念，有了這樣一個好的賺錢的捷徑，還有誰甘願放棄呢丨於是一人效之，百人隨之，起先祇限於上海一處，慢慢的蔓延到鄕鎭與各大邑去，這個賺錢的捷徑，正是全國皆知了。</p>
<p>「大廉價」三個字，漸漸的失其效力的時候，聰明的商人，就運用他的腦筋，想出什麼：「犧牲品」「便宜貨」還有什麼；「特别犧牲品」「非常便宜貨」∶∶∶∶∶∶等來號召一般購買者，在起先似乎打嗎啡針一樣，有些效力，後來却又覺得没有什麼應騐，於是又用：「羊毛出在羊身上」的辦法來：「大贈品」，可是也不能永久，總於要洶汰了的。</p>
<p>時至今日，國難日深，外侮日亟，大好的商塲，丨丨包括全國各埠丨都因了營業不振，連接連的舉行×季大廉價，特别大廉價，×周紀念大廉價；你們是這樣的舉行，他們也這樣的舉行，一條街上，差不多是接得住的，東面的的打：西面咚咚鐺的震得走路的人雙耳欲聾，照理這樣的盛大鼓吹，營業的收入</p>
<p>，可以超出平日：可是仔細一調查，竟會降至平日營業總數之下的也有，這是什麼原因呢？一半當然是市面不好，一</p>
<p>般人的購買力，隨之薄弱：一半因爲大多數的商店，自欺欺人，不能取信於一般惠顧者，甚至有一般眼光短淺的商店，雇用了人，在門口大拉大扯的情形，這更是失掉了商店的規律，我以爲負有地方之責者，再不加以限制，恐怕要造</p>
<p>成更惡劣的情形了吧丨就是在不久的將來，你歸你大吹大擂，我歸我不睬不買，到了那時候，要變成一種怎樣恐慌的境地？可是難以描繪了。</p>
<p>我以爲專售國貨的商店，或大範圍的百貨公司，尤其應當禁標新立異，不應當隨波逐流的去仿效人家，要知道國貨的銷行，全仗定價劃一，丨丨我所說的</p>

<h3 id="c187">關於國貨流動推銷 <a href="#c187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— 周成助</p>
<p>國貨展覧會的呼聲。時常震撼着我們的耳鼓。但是細細的審查一上，除掉幾年前舉行的中華國貨展覧會，以及遠涉千里的河南流動展覧會幹了一些熱烈的工作，此外東也展覧，西也展覧，不是幾所草棚棚苟且舉辦，便是完全被販售商佔有，而且，有一部份廠商是抱着牟利的念頭，所以收得的效果，眞是有限。</p>
<p>這種專在城市里宣傳而没有向上層民衆隊去灌輸國貨觀念力量的國貨展覧會，實在是浮於表同上的搖旗呐喊，都會裹儘是喊得應天響，鄕村內地依舊不關痛癢，我們試看有幾種洋貨的藥品化妝品，他們不惜在工本的內地到處畫着大塊廣告，甚至雇了小火輪直駛鄕村去半送半買，這種宮有犧牲心栽别出的推銷方法，的確値得我們從事國貨事業者的參考。</p>
<p>有過幾個國貨旅行團體，曾經幹過一時的流動推銷工作，他們到處和當地</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>行政敎育機關合作，還用抗日影片帮助和强有力的宣傳，我們很歡服他們所用的苦心，但近來似乎没有以前那樣的有生氣了。這不能不可惜他們缺乏寬裕的經濟，没有中心的意議，最大的原因，實在是工廠們做了被動，没有充實的力量去援助他們，以致騐少數份子聲嘶力竭，餐風宿露，結果精神渙散，功虧一簣。</p>
<p>於是，我相信，要把國貨流動推銷測肉地鄕村，而希望民間得到深刻的影象，唯一的先着，是先應該從各個著名國貨廠商主動集合，備了充分的經濟力量，充分的才人思想，一洗以前展覧會那種草草敷衍的弊病，眞眞實實的工作起來。</p>
<p>民間的知識程度以及鑒别觀念是很淺簡的，他們幾乎根本不能辨别國貨非國貨，更爲了近來農村經濟的崩潰，很容易上當的化了低價去購置仇貨來用，國貨在這個年頭，分向內地鄕村去宣傳推廣，全在運用淺顯的標識，普通的方法，否則用了都市裏那樣高超的手法去對民衆人士號召勸用，結果一定失敗的。</p>
<p>其次，國貨流動推銷這件事，不僅僅乎跑碼頭式的兜圈子大吹大擂就算完了，他應當負有調查內地市情，經濟情形以及國貨趨勢的任務，他非但應和當地商店關合工作，還須詳細指導商買們關於經營國貨和銷售國貨上一切良好的步序，以期「產」「販」「銷」各方而成功三位一體的密切的關係丨</p>

<p>— 禺厂</p>
<p>地大物博的我國，所謂國貨，範圍是極廣大的。但從性質上加以分忻，可概括上列名類：</p>
<p>（一）各地土產。</p>
<p>（二）以本國原料，本國資本及人力製造的工業品。</p>
<p>（三）本國資本和人力，加上外國原料而成的物品。</p>
<p>（四）海外華僑製造的物品。</p>
<p>一二兩項，爲純粹的國貨，固無絲毫疑問，三四兩項，則不稍加說明，或不免滋人疑實，記者戚友之中，即有以此見訽者，因略述鄙見於左，以質諸本刋讀者。</p>
<p>我國工業，尙未發達，製造廠家，所用原料，仰給外商者多。如鋼鐵，如鋁，如染料，台人造絲，如化妝品中之香料，如搪瓷之釉色，如肥皂之硬化油，如製紙之紙漿，如人造象牙之石炭酸，我國均不能自製，這些原料品，固然希望漸次能有國產代替，俾成爲完全的國貨，然而在未有代替品以前，能利用外國原料，加工製造，以抵制外商的製成品，其裨益國計民生，固已不淺，我們能說那些不是國貨麼？</p>
<p>海外華僑，赤手空拳，在異國政府壓迫下，憑着自己的血汗，植立經濟基礎。每年將所得的一部分，匯回祖國，無形中爲我國對外貿易現金流出的一筆鉅大的彌補。且彼等愛國熱忱，遠非國內同胞所可企及。歷來爲革命，爲國內建設，爲對外抗戰，所捐欵項，數以萬</p>
<p>萬計。彼等在國外所創事業。如新加坡陳嘉庚之橡皮業，仰光永安堂之藥品，暹羅僑商之燕窩。南洋僑胞自織之襪衫，姿羅洲僑胞自編之蓆，美洲僑商自種之西洋參，皆能運諸國內，爲外貨之勁敵。是以華僑所製之貨品，原可謂眞正國貨，國內各處國貨商店，均應儘力爲之推銷，固不應爲人所否認者也。</p>

<h3 id="c190">國貨推銷到內地去 <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 許難公</p>
<p>國貨普遍內地是目前所急切的需要，也是國貨界共同的目標，雖然現在有不少的熱心份子，踴躍地組織着什麼國貨流動推銷團，國貨旅行團，國貨流動宣傳團等等的團體，不辭辛勞，奔波跋涉，紛赴內地各處宣揚展覧，其用意之深，用心之苦，一種爲國貨而奮鬥的精神，眞使　我們欽佩萬分的了。</p>
<p>在這裏我有小小的意見，也就是我的理想，恐怕聰明的先生們早已見到了，但不妨作我們互相間的探討吧，橡現在他們的這種組織，當然是很須要的，不過我以爲流動宣傳，祇能引起內地人民的注意，爲一時的認識，不能永久的使他們了解，供給他們的需要，是一種消極的提倡，不是澈底的根本推廣，因爲流動的工作，到一城或一鎭，暫駐一月或十日陳列展覧銷售，而人民所需用的物品，斷乎不能在這極短的昌期內，將一切應用物品盡量的購買，尤其在這鄕民經濟薄弱的時期，怎的有這種能力來預購備置暫時所不急需的物品。</p>
<p>事實告訴我們內地人民的物質享受，除了一部份用的自己勞力換來的土布菜飯受用外，其他的日常用品都購之於鄰近的城鎮，而一般的商舖，大都是營利爲目的，具有愛國思想者郤是鳳毛麟角，所以店舖向較大的城市或都會批來的貨品，不問其爲國貨洋貨，甚而至於是劣貨丨祇取春進價的低廉而販售。因此內地人民雖抱愛國熱誠要服用國貨，但因無處問津而不得不就近購置，所以國貨的難以深入內地，泰半被一般販賣商於中操縱，形成了生產和銷費者的隔離！</p>
<p>我們旣已見到上述的弊病，就得要設法彌補。從積極的路上將國貨灌輸到內地去，而方法的妥善週密段得合許多人的規劃，現將愚見所及寫在後面。</p>
<p>集言資金創設國貨總店或公司於重要都市（如上海天津∶∶∶等），立支店分號於各地市鎭，以市面的大小與交通的便利而分配，使內地和都市連絡一氣，與各國貨工廠訂立推銷合同契約，以最低的價格大量批入，配發各支店，廉價出售减輕人民負擔，貨物運輸利用航輪</p>
<p>船隻丨（如各地航船）分送支店，如是則內地需用物品不致缺乏，而生產工廠無難銷之虞，灌通生產和銷費者的供求，驅除內地和都市的隔膜，更能熟悉各地風俗習慣而加以改進，國貨前途實有莫大的裨益。</p>
<p>雖然，此種組織類似國貨介紹所等，但一則以各省都會爲目標，一則專心於內地鄕村，方法雖同而用意各異，所謂各盡所能各展所長了。</p>
<h3 id="c191">我國之蚊烟香事業（上） <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— 松廬</p>
<p>天氣漸漸的熱起來了，那可惡的蚊蟲，不久便會成帮結隊的來肆虐，諸若：且莫忽視了這小東西，牠不特能擾人淸夢，吮人膏血，並且能傳播瘧疾，造成恐怖的社會！人類爲維持睡眠的安寗，保護身體的安全，不得不想出法子來，驅逐牠，撲滅牠，於是蚊烟香一物。便成爲夏令的必備品了。</p>
<p>在二十年前，我國尙無安全有效的蚊烟香，市上所售的，無非是用本屑繕骨捲成的土製蚊香：這種蚊香，全憑燃燒時烟薰的猛烈，將蚊蟲暫時驅避。但因其烟氣迷漫，衝人鼻管，並且硫黄繕骨，都含有輕微毒質，與衛生大有妨碍。更以其火力太强，偶一不愼，便往往會引起火災。所以有些講究衛生的人們，都情願摒棄不用，而聽受那蚊蟲的騷擾。</p>
<p>自從日貨豬牌安住蚊烟香傾銷我國後，國人以其製法新奇，功效特大，自然是優勝劣敗，於是大家捨此就彼，爭相購用，國貨土製的蚊香被其打倒，而仇貨蚊香在華傾銷，我國這一筆漏巵，爲數每年恒在一百萬元以上</p>
<p>新式蚊香的製法，是用白花除蟲菊粉爲主要原料。除蟲菊是一種草本的植物，可與稻麥豆類輪作；並且栽培極易，無論在山坡原野之間，果園菜圃之內，都可種植，無不昌茂。所以美奧日本諸國，除蟲菊一物，多佔農作物主要的生產。輸出額以美國爲最多，據一九二八</p>
<p>年的調查，單就乾花一項，就有九百餘萬斤，價値在六百萬元以上。其次澳洲和日本產額也很多；日本在近年以來，輸出額年有增加，在一九一○年，日本的除蟲菊乾花輸出額，僅有十三萬餘斤，經二十年之努力種植，銳意推廣，至一九二九年，竟達八百三十餘萬斤，這樣的突飛猛晋，幾在世界市塲壓倒美奧諸國，而執全世界的牛耳了。（未完）</p>

<p>— 竹君</p>
<p>在這裏，我們要預先聲明：並不是無意識地恭維，也並是爲任何人作廣告，我們覺得這樣的「洋博士」是中國社會裏所不容易找到的；他雖然並不自諛爲「麻哈子麻結」，但一般人却都尊他爲「中國的甘地」；此次邰博士南來，記者有緣與之接談，茲將談話內容之大略寫出，以介紹於國人之前，並告有志提倡國貨事業者記者問：「提倡國貨，固屬目前當務之急，然而數十年來毫無成效，究屬何故？」</p>
<p>邰博士答：「这个問題說來範圍太大，總」</p>
<p>而言之，大家都爲了愛美心理的驅使，物質生活的提高，且社會上對於提倡國貨振興實業，並無切實組織，而國貨本身，仍多墨守成章，所以「提倡」又「提倡」，始終未奏成效了。」</p>
<p>「那末博士對此究有何補救方法？」</p>
<p>「十餘年來我一貫主張先要從各個人自身做起！漸而推及於社會大衆，那最切實的辦法當然祇有各個人節儉，這便是所謂社會節約」了；丨丨我們旣大家不用外貨，那年出數萬萬的金錢，自然可以挽回了，挽回之後又將怎樣呢？我們應該集合起來籌辦都市工廠，鄕村合作社等，庶使工人有飯吃，農民有錢用，然後再從事於生產事業，再把出產品銷售國內各地，這便是所謂「社會生產」了。∶∶∶說起來這兩</p>
<p>件事都是輕而易舉的，不過大家不肯注意罷了！∶∶∶」</p>
<p>我們爲了篇幅關係，許多無關緊要的話，都不能一一寫出，但卽此經很値得我們的注意了。</p>
<p>邰博士年僅三十五六與四川甘地盧作孚不同。身材魁梧，身着靑斜紋土布工人服，頭戴鴨舌帽，據他說祇値一角半錢；足登黑土布鞋，舉止溫存，言笑和藹，一切儉樸耐勞，身體力行，誰也不會知道他是「哥倫比亞」大學的博士吧！</p>

<p>— 劉曾慰</p>
<p>在離開上海不遠的一角，住着一位年約三十餘歲的王先生。他有三個兒子，二個女兒，一個老婆，一家七口，都靠着他做一家公司裏的帳席的收入而生活的，可是他的收入很少，又以那地方離開上海不遠，風氣都隨着上海而轉移，上海的摩登女士，大都喜用洋貨，於是那地方的中上等家的人，亦跟着大用洋貨，王先生的家，雖算不得是一個上等之家，亦差可以算是中等人家，因此，王先生的夫人，和子女們，亦不免要趨入時髦，大用洋貨，弄得支出繁多，寅吃卯　，王先生幾次三番苦勸他家人不要染傳時下惡習，還以穿着土布購用國貨爲宜，他夫人子女，那裏肯聽？直把王先生氣得鬍子撟了起來，又急得他無法可想，整日夜的愁眉苦臉。</p>
<p>這一天，阿林在路上遠遠的看見王先生一個人在踽踽獨行，走向自己的地方來，他想他又要看見他愁眉深鎖的一副面孔了。不料走近了招呼以後，他見王先生很是快樂，一些没有從前的憂愁的痕跡了，他好奇怪，不免要問一下究竟是怎麼道理，這一問，却把王先生快樂的理由，完全揭露出來了。</p>
<p>王先生畢究如何會這樣快樂的呢？原來由他自己的努力，已經把他的家人完全勸醒，服用國貨了。這他着實考慮了一回的。他想他家人若是這樣的迷信洋貨，他區區的收入，怎夠他們的耗費？一年年的寅吃卯喝過下去，將來的結果，一定是不堪設想，所以他决計要趁一個機會，把他們勸醒過來，不用洋貨，而樂用國貨。他正打定了這個主意，恰巧中國國貨公司舉行國貨時裝展覧，他想趁這個機會，帶他夫人去看看，也許可以把他喜用洋貨衣料的心改變過來吧。這樣，他就在公司裏没事之後，帶他夫人去參觀那時裝展覧會了。結果竟然很好，他夫人說：「國貨時裝，却不比洋貨服裝差。」</p>
<p>隔了些時，寗波同鄕會又有國貨宣傳大會的舉行。王先生想這又是個勸醒他家人喜用洋貨的好機會了。他又乘暇帶了他的夫人和子女們一同去參加那個宣傳會去。那宣傳會裏有許多人演說，把服用國貨的理由，發揮得非常透澈，着實打進人人的心坎深處去，並且大家又宣誓購用國貨。主一來，給於王先生夫人和子女的影響，的却不小，他們從此翻然改悟，不再服用洋貨了。</p>
<p>自從王先生的家，不用洋貨之後，市商會的國貨商塲，和其他幾個國貨公司，時常有王夫人和他子女的蹤跡了可是王先生的經濟，寬裕了不少。從前每月的薪金，終不夠開支，現在非但每月很寬裕的去，並且還有餘剩，因爲國貨普通終比洋貨價錢便宜，並且大都是經久耐用的。式樣也許有的不十分好，不過這是無關大要，反止實用是眞的，何况現在的國貨製造者，正在研究改良呢。</p>
<p>王先生經濟一寬裕，他的愁眉苦臉就消失了，所以幾個月没有見過他的阿林，在那天見王先生很是快樂，而王先生也很高興的告訴了他快樂的理由</p>

<p>— 晴廬</p>
<p>二十餘人結伴游山，一陳腥風起處，山坳裏跳出一隻矮腳脚虎，惡很很的便來嚙人。</p>
<p>假使，這　人都有了防身利器，那麼，以二十餘人制伏一猛虎，本是綽綽有餘。無奈，他們都是徒手游行，又加着內部渙散，不能一致懲侮：以致，這頭猛虎仗着爪牙的銳利，向這一　赤手空拳的人，大肆摧殘！結果，二十餘人內，被它呑去了四人。依着老虎的貪心，最好把這二十餘人吃得一個不剩，决不使他们做那虎口餘生：但，心有餘而胃不足，吃了四個人，已是撑腸掛肚，非得消化一下子，不能夠再動食慾了。</p>
<p>餘是，老虎伸了一個腰，收拾起惡很很的態度，而成爲一隻笑面老虎；向着那些虎口餘生說道：「親愛的，從今以後，你不吃我們了，我要把吃人主義，變而爲親善主義，親愛的，不要害怕啊。」</p>
<p>許多虎口餘生的中間，有一個人向着老虎說：「你不要口頭親善了，你眞個表示親善，何不把吃下的四個人吃了出來呢？即使，不能全吐，也可吐出一半；吃了我們的肉，還了我們的骨，不比空言親善，好的多麼？」</p>
<p>笑面虎一聲冷笑道：「笨貨，你道我眞个親善麼？我所说的親，是王老虎抢親的親；我所說的善，是强盜發善心的善。」</p>

<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>「大門八字開，無錢莫進來。」這是古時人形容衙門中人的見錢眼開，不花白花花的銀元寶，便休來告狀打官司。所以每遇靑天大老爺打道回衙，便常有在當街碰着響頭，攪輿告狀的苦主，一把眼淚，二把鼻涕的呼冤呌屈。</p>
<p>在古時，究竟大門八字開，無錢莫進來的，不過是衙門而已，到了這一九三三年，可就不對啦。不拘甚麼所在，都是大門八字開，無錢莫進」來了。</p>
<p>請瞧罷，五步一學府，十步一大學，怎一個不是大門兒八字的開着，但是學，膳，宿，書籍，僕役，體育，圖書館，學校建築等費，在算盤上三下五除二，五推五成十的一算，準會使一滴汗換一個子兒的父兄們，嚇得吐出了舌頭縮不進去。</p>
<p>自建十八層大厦的银行，大門八字兒開着，可是窮大漢，是只夠資格在八字開的大門外，呆呆地出一會神的。普通的商店，雖然，在八字開的大門上，寫着「歡迎參觀」但若尊駕身邊「畢的生司」，而混在裏面看一個無休列歇，招待員防你多生一個手，準會亦步亦趨，「極誠招待」得你自己覺得不好意思。</p>
<p>菜館，飯店，戲院，舞塲，賭窟，妓寮，没有七錢一分五，莫想走進八字形兒開着的大門，就是叢林古刹裏出家人慈悲爲本的老師父，假使手捧着緣簿，而尊駕漲紅着臉，手伸在袋裏縮不出來時，那副「慈眉善眼」準會使你三過八字兒開的大門，而不敢一入。</p>
<p>八字兒開的典當門，說是方便窮人的。但包脚布都没有一塊的朋友。就是要賞鑒一下朝奉先生的皂隸面孔，怕也有些累贅哪。</p>

<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>蓬萊吳子玉將軍，近來蟄居故都什錦花園內，消磨英氣，韜晦殊深,新聞記者往訪，司閽者輒以主人抱病不見客爲辭，實則吳日以栽花飬魚書竹念經自課，身體方面絕無恙疢也。園中有綠色茶　一種，尤爲吳所喜賞。蓋茶　花開，一白似雪，此所以楊萬里有亂吹香雪灑闌干，元好問有玉缨多處臥殘春之句，素鮮作胭脂紅者。而北地苦無竹，吳畫竹乃益勤，使琅玕翠影，常留於筆墨尺幅之間，以補造化所未及。濼東緊張時，外間頗有傳其與日方有相當聯絡，行將活動於華北者。吳聞之甚憤，謂：國家危急之秋，吳某未能驅十萬　磨劍以報國，心殊內疚，豈忍作賣國行動，貽天下人之唾罵者乎。或謂吳之爲人，性絕剛愎，對於日方，本所嫉惡。曩年奉直之戰，吳率數十萬健兇，由四照堂出發赴榆關。軍容之壯，車馬槍械之多，氣淩霄漢，聲震河山，吳得意非常，招待各國觀戰員，許以戰情報告國外，惟報告底稿，須經吳審閱，始得拍無線電，以免機密之或洩也。不料日本報紙，時有吳軍之密訊發表，吳大訝異，乃下令搜索觀戰員之列車，竟於日人車中，獲軍用鴿十有二頭，此密訊之所由傳佈者。吳大怒，立將十二鴿處之</p>
<p>死，　齒而言曰：日人狡詐，將來必爲我害，殺鴿所以示我除狡滅詐之决心耳。此民國十三年事，言猶在耳，則錢間所傳，絕非事實可知。深願吳好自爲之，保國尙有日也。</p>

<p>熱心憐少女挾纊親來</p>
<p>這個時候，桂枝的確也在注意積之的行動，以爲那天用那種氣話去刺激了他一番，他多少總有一個回響的，且靜候兩天，看他情形如何。不料直候一星期之久，並不見一點消息。不得已，還是用上次那個法子，去向甘家的女僕，去打聽下落。據女僕說，有一天，二爺由衙門裏，收拾舖蓋行李就走了，看那樣子，好像是和老爺生氣，但是老爺在家裏，什麼話也没有說他。據我們太太說，老爺把他薦到城裏去了，他已經有了好事情呢。桂枝道：是那一天走的呢？女僕道：彷彿是元宵節那一天，那天吃元宵，家裏短了一個人啦。桂枝一想，正是元宵那一天曾用話去刺激他的，不料他當天就走了，這分明是他進一步的躱開我了。心裏這樣想着，也就不必再盤問什麼，逕自回家了。這次回家，也像上次聽了老媽子的消息一樣，恨不得立刻就關上門來痛哭一次。只是母親正在屋子裏作活，不容他再哭，因之伏在外面茶几上裝打瞌睡，極力的把眼淚忍耐住了。江氏在屋子裏看到這種情形，料着他又是犯了什麼心事，心裏便想着，正好借此作最後的努力，話裏套話，探探他的口氣怎樣。便道：老姑娘，你把繩子上晾的兩雙線襪子拿了進來。那都是趙連長的我得給人家縫一縫。桂枝没有說什麼，拿進兩雙襪子來，向坑上一扔。江氏道：這點事還要我做啦，你就找兩塊布，給趙連長繚上襪底罷。桂枝將襪子拿在手上看了一看，因道：襪字底並没有壞，好好的加塊底作什麼？江氏道：你不知道，趙連長是個會過日子的人，他知道每天上操塲總是難爲鞋襪的，所以趕緊先補工底。據我看，這個人樣樣都好。桂枝也没有說什麼，在破木櫉子裏，抽出一隻抽屜，在裏面翻檢了一陣，檢出两兩塊布，就在坑上開始補起襪底來（九三）</p>

<p>— 恒秋</p>
<p>丨女人種類的分晰丨</p>
<p>凡不甘做和尙的人，都有一件終身大事丨婚姻丨在等待着你去解决，古人爲什麼把婚姻兩字，目之爲大事呢？簡單說，就是呌你不要把它當做一件很容易解决的小事！而現在的一般靑年，在機會難得時，見到一個女人，就極力向伊進攻；往往在還没有絲毫了解伊的本質時，已和伊發生了情感，男女之間，一生了情感，就把一切的理智都毁滅了，這是多麼危險的事，因此，造成功離婚，遺棄，重婚∶∶∶種種婚姻的罪惡。</p>
<p>凡不甘做和尙的人都要娶妻，要娶妻又不得不加以審愼，要审愼，一定要將你所認識的對象中，各别的加以週密的選擇，但大選擇在前，我們一定要明暸社會上究竟有那幾種女人？我經過幾次縝密人分晰，約有五種：</p>
<p>（一）能自食其力的鄉女</p>
<p>伊是一朶路旁的野花，有一種天然的美，随时在流露着，更有一种自然的力，來飬活伊自己；伊並不需要人工的灌溉，也不會吐出濃郁的香味來使人們注意伊。</p>
<p>（二）以嫁丈夫爲職業的小家碧玉</p>
<p>伊們的主義是：「在家靠父母，出嫁靠丈夫」，嫁了以後的唯一責任是替丈夫傳種接代，大都很富於服從性，自己承認是男人的附屬品。</p>
<p>（三）視丈夫爲奴隸的大家閨秀</p>
<p>伊們是天之驕子，常想找一個溫存體貼的丈夫，來做伊隨身的奴隸，因此，「怎樣可以使丈夫屈服」的方法，最喜歡討論，研究，因爲伊們有的是錢，法律是能夠很週到的保護伊們的，所以也不怕丈夫和伊離婚。</p>
<p>（四）以男子爲玩物的浪漫女性</p>
<p>伊們能用人工的顏色去麻醉男人，並且能用香水精與嘴唇膏，換得優美的生活，大槪都是些流浪在社會上的交際花，舞星，優伶，以及其他以色相爲生活者等等，伊们的魔力是：能顚倒你的理智，能轉移你的悲歡，將你整個生活操在手裏磨折，縱玩弄，但伊們遇到了權貴者，自己也會做了男人的玩物。</p>
<p>（五）有相當學識的摩登女郎</p>
<p>伊們大概都是些學校敎員，公司職員，以及公務機關裏紅花瓶之類，都有着相當的學識，伊們因爲能夠自立，都自以爲是最摩登的女人，任何種類的女人，都瞧不起，伊們的眼晴似乎生在額角上，可謂驕傲之極，所以做伊們的丈夫，是很不容易的一件事，非有超過伊們的學識，財力，地位，决不能免除伊們的蔑視。</p>
<p>因爲男人的種類也不一，所以我並不需要確定那種女人最好，祇要：我們把女人的種類分淸了，才開始擇妻的第一步手續丨確定那一種女人最適合自己的環境，丨確定以後，再開始向你所確定的種類中，去求一個性，智識，容貌，都適合於自己的女人，來做妻子（致於伊認爲你適合與否是另外一個問題）那末，總可以得到一個眞美滿的結果。</p>
<p>有很多靑年，擇妻的常識没有充足，祇在小目標上注意，以爲祇要個性，智識，容貌，認爲適合了就行了，而没有知道大目標丨分晰女人的種類丨的重要，因此造成種種婚姻的悲劇的，不知凡幾，因爲伊的個性，智識，容貌，你雖認爲及格了，而伊的地位和環境，和你不相吻合時，就會使你得到意錢的失望，靑年們！不甘做和尙的靑年們！快愼重你們的大事吧</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3 id="c239">自由的爆裂 <a href="#c239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— 豈凡</p>
<p>爭取自由的呼聲，是每一個時代都有的，我前次却說出了不要自由的口號，</p>
<p>好像是故意街奇。但自由要有限度，要有範圍，不一常常有人說的麼？而且一般人都是認可這些話的。自由而有了範圍限度，還能成自由嗎？那麼，還是乾脆不要自由。</p>
<p>自由的爭奪是常常起於集團與個人之間，集團往往要限制個人的自由，干涉個人的自由，否認個人的自由。個人倘使是集團的一員，他倘使明白是屬於集團的，他總肯不要自由，而容許集團的意志來支配。因爲個人與集團是不能對立的，集團的地位高於個人，集團有絕對的支配權。</p>
<p>一集團的組成，是基於這一集團的共同一致的利害關係，所以集團的利害，是一集團人三體的利害，集團的所以有絕對的支配權力，根據便在這一點。但當一個集團的組織生了毛病，以致不能代表一個集團的共同利害時，各個人對於集團的支配便覺得不滿足，爭取自由的呼聲於是發出來了。</p>
<p>譬如國家，本來是爲了全人民的福利而組織的，人民總是服從中央擁護政府的，但當一個國家政府被人民覺到了只是收取稅捐榨取壓逼的機構時，人民就有要求自由的呼聲了。國家的一切設施，不以人民的福利爲前提，便已失却集團組織的本旨，即是已生毛病，所以便有這病象的發現。</p>
<p>爭取自由的呼聲，實在是一種病的　候。聰敏的爲政者，知道有了病須得醫治，而蠢笨的往往很蠢笨，不認得那是一種病，當做集團的權力是天定的，而看不到在根本地方有共同的利害關係，想濫用那種權力來鎮壓，於是就弄到不可收拾的地步。這些蠢才，不明白集團的意義，也不了解權力的根據，貿然地來從政，正同瞎子駕車一樣危險。</p>
<p>對於爭取自由的呼聲而咸得驚慌的，還是可造之才，惟有蠢笨的人績績採用高壓政策，結果將不免引發一次自由的爆裂。</p>
<h3 id="c240">談談第十一種藝術 <a href="#c240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— 黎錦明</p>
<p>到了相當年齡，娛樂上的事都漸感到乏味了。記得十年以前，因爲覺得自己還不出一個非力士丁，只要是新奇的事便想去管一下，尤其是對於電影。後來對於人世的閱歷也漸不同了，覺得電影裏面所愛表現的總不大呌人相信，於是就一想五六年；殊不知在這五六年間，電影已有了長足驚人的進步；無論在內容與技巧方面有時還要勝過許多磊文藝作品。（思想是談不到！）</p>
<p>我覺得使電影成爲藝術，使電影明星們成爲第十一位繆斯，大半要歸功於導演。我在四個片子——栗阿栗姐，大監獄，摩洛哥，大飯店一裏面，不但看到導演們有操縱影星們表演天才的能力，還能選擇文藝上優好的題材，還能眾美學方法上找些公式來，呌平淡的印象變成強烈的印象，使一盤豆芽變成加厘雞的風味。</p>
<p>栗阿栗妲雖然是一本羅曼斯，但從頭到尾沒有一處是鬆懈的，——最好的是它的對比（這都是美學上和修辭學上的名詞）。俗語說得好，因莊見諧，因悲見喜，——這本來就是劇曲上的原理，在莎翁的羅密歐與朱麗葉中可見到插科打諢的，在中國的舊劇上，排一齣四郎探母必得來一齣附加稅親家母進城，也就是這種幌子，不過看你排比得切實與否罷。說得不客氣，栗阿栗妲完全是古典的；明明覺得這種事不會有，看了卻非呌你相信不可。</p>
<p>大監獄，大飯店，完全是寫實的，摩洛哥寫實之外，還帶些象徵的風味。有人說，大監獄也是象徵的；華萊士比雷扮的那兇棍代表者革命，路易斯東扮的那獄官代表著反動。結果反動壓平了革命，奸像是說在赤色光芒之下，出了慕沙里尼各希特拉的勤王思想，在藝術上也未見得不是大書特書的事。不過這種解說，以我的意思，猶如教授們考證紅樓夢似的，不見得可靠；這免不了完全是寫實的只要看客們不妨去經驗一些牢獄生活。最動人的是裏面爲基督教思想的復活罷。</p>
<p>摩洛哥簡直是一幅逃亡藪的生活縮影，瑪侖黛瑞西的成功眞是驚人。（以我的意見，她要勝過嘉波十倍）勾心鬥角，陰險，暗殺，命運和報復，——在這種構圖下所生的英雄和美人，眞沒有一處呌人想到是做作的。結末還說：戀愛，走向沙漠去！這猶如說：青鳥是有的，但是牠在籠子裏關不住的。……將大飯店來比大監獄與摩洛哥，好比自然主義比寫實主義；內容并不緊張，輕淡的表演下，見到都會生活中的生與死，悲劇與喜劇，似乎還帶些做人的教訓。</p>
<p>如果中國能有這種片子產生，而一至受到種種限制產生時，也未始不是光榮罷。</p>
<h3 id="c241">阿琳 <a href="#c241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— 彭雪珍</p>
<p>深夜，獨自個打琳妞的家裏出來，帶上破扉，我彳亍在滿噓着六月的晚風的街上。</p>
<p>三天前，琳還充滿了喜悅和希望地說話兒，還支撑着難行的步履來來去去，臉上老堆着笑。現在怎麼了，竟殭臥在那兒，頭前還點着白臘！</p>
<p>我瞅着躺在琳的床上的一對才出世的孩子，頰上泛着嬰兒特有的紅暈，閉着小眼睛在打盹兒。這兩個無知的孩子，還不知道她們的媽已永遠離開了這人間，當她們才踏進這有着光亮的世界，當她們才睜開了細弱的小眼的時候。</p>
<p>孩子的啼聲中，埋葬了小母親的健壯的生命，雖然孩子是爲的不安或對於新世界的恐懼才哭的，但琳是望望站在床前的老髦的媽，望望周圍的許多認識或不認識的人們，扭動着全身的肌肉開始了她的另一世界的行程。也許這行程是永恒的，充滿了新鮮的况味的。</p>
<p>琳是一個心地坦白的女子。因操作而被太陽曬黑了的臉總也掩不住她的健康的肌膚。不多說話，可是每一句話都是誠摯的，使聽者信服。她每天是那麼大淸早起來洗衣裳，橋底下流着澄澈的水，琳赤了足蹲在河邊，每一下木棒都含着有她和她母親底生命。她們每天下午到各處去收取衣服，用她們的手，再加上胰子以外的水和陽光，她們是眞生活在自然的給與中的。</p>
<p>但有一天，琳突然失踪了，聽說是和一個男子走了，老母親瞇着眼睛告訴人家，說她女兒到另外一个城裏享福去了。</p>
<p>「你們瞧，不久琳和女婿就得來接我，我們再也不吃苦了，洗衣裳，冬天可眞苦。」老女人神秘地笑着，愛管閒事的人們不大相信她的話，胡亂地猜疑起來。</p>
<p>日子是像橋底下的水一樣地，流了去，永不再流回來。</p>
<p>正像去的時候一樣，有一天，琳又突然悄悄地溜回來了，穿着以前所没有的衣裳，眼睛顯得陷凹，常是一個人出神，没有以前那樣活潑了，老女人再也不在人前說笑了。</p>
<p>琳更　了下去，每天在河灘上無力地洗着衣裳，有時一言不發地對着河水凝眸好久，帶着苦臉回去。</p>
<p>没有人知道琳的秘密，更没有人知道她心裏的哀怨，人們只是莫明其妙地爲這女孩歎息着。</p>
<p>琳的肚子一天一天的大起來了。</p>
<p>孩子氣地，琳羞澀地在太陽底下縫着未來的孩子的衣服，微笑着透露出母親的喜悅，但那喜悅裏却又含着有深長的尤怨。</p>
<p>現在，琳是帶着她的秘密和哀怨長逝了，今天躺在那裏的不是死了的琳麼？生命的海裏，一個泡沬消散了，跟着一　波浪滾走了。</p>
<p>幽靈似的，我往東走，河水嗚咽似地動蕩着，在路旁的古木的陰影中，我覺得琳在向我走來，像以前一樣活潑地到我們巷裏來取衣裳。</p>
<h3 id="c242">孩子們 <a href="#c242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— 蘇</p>
<p>幾天來，爲了身子不舒服，没有出過門；今天去找醫生，便到外邊去走了一趟。</p>
<p>一路所經過的，照常是狹的弄，没有太陽的街，和那灰塵迷漫的馬路。在那些地方，我見到許多孩子。</p>
<p>成羣的孩子聚在街中，跳着，跑着，呌着，閙着；没有誰止住他們，也没有誰保護他們他們從這條街到那條街，瘋狂跑巡游着，好像街是他們唯一的樂園。</p>
<p>牆邊的　地裏，每處都有幾個孩子在擲錢，他們像是對於這事很有興趣似的，長久長久地留在那裏。</p>
<p>當我經過一條靜寂的巷時，有一個孩子領着一個盲孩在我面前走過；他緊閉着雙目，一手拊在前面的孩子的肩上，輕輕地敲着小　，隨着他的侶伴緩緩穿過這幽巷。</p>
<p>馬路上：三全赤膊的孩子拖着三串稀爛的草鞋氣喘喘地走着；一個没有發育完全的童年車夫勉力地挽着空車，在向行人招攬生意；樹陰下有一個婦人在喂着她懷裏的嬰兒，在她旁邊立着幾個孩子，他們一見有人走來，便隨在後面唱着：「好少爺，好老爺，做做好事吧！」伸着手希望人家給他三分之一的一個大餅的代價。</p>
<p>路旁的垃圾箱前，爬垃圾的孩子俯着身在箱裏搜索；破布屑，空鐵罐，玻璃瓶，肉骨頭，雞鴨毛，這些都是他的恩物，他小心地檢着拾在他的小籃裏。</p>
<p>大橋堍下，有兩三個孩子候在那裏；當人力車過橋的時候，他們爭先的在車後一手推着，一手伸出向坐車人乞錢，低聲喊着「先生先生」，從橋的這邊一直跟到橋的那邊。</p>
<p>一個坐車的人說，「街上有這許多孩子，路都被他們擠滿了！」</p>
<p>回家來，翻開才到的報紙，一角裏刋着：「兩學童同時失踪</p>
<p>丨遺書謂將入山求道」</p>
<p>啊！這些孩子！也有誰想到這些孩子，肯救救這些孩子嗎？</p>

<p>泉水（續）</p>
<p>敎父丨睡呀，畜生，睡呀！</p>
<p>但敎父和敎男彼此都不能睡着。紅蘿蔔鬚翻來覆去，窒息着，在尋求窒氣　使得他那老敎父看着都有些不忍。</p>
<p>突然，當紅蘿蔔鬚快要入寐時，敎父抓着他的手臂說：</p>
<p>「你在這裏嗎，畜生？我在做萝，我覺得你還在泉水裏面呢。你記得起那次掉在泉水裏的事情嗎？」</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚丨好比現刻還在那裏面一樣的淸楚，敎父。這事我並不怪你，可是你却時常對我提起這事。</p>
<p>敎父丨可憐的畜生，我祇要一想起這事，人便渾身發抖。我那時在草地上睡着了。你在泉水邊上頑着，你滑倒了，你落在泉水裏面，你呌喚着，你掙扎着，而我呢，該死極了，竟什麼都没聽見。泉水並不怎樣深，祇好溺死一頭貓罷了，可是你却不站起來。禍根就埋在這裏啦，你那時難道想不到要站立起來？</p>
<p>紅蘿鬚丨你難道以爲我還能記起沉没在泉水裏時所想到的事嗎！</p>
<p>敎父丨丨末了你在水裏面那樣閙着畢竟把我弄醒了。還好，總算没有淹死。可憐的畜生啊！可憐的畜生啊！你像水龍一樣吐着。别人給你把衣裳換了，給你穿上小倍爾納星期日穿的衣服。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚丨丨對啦，那件衣裳把我刺得發癢。我滿身搔着。這簡直是一件舖着　的衣裳啦。</p>
<p>敎父丨丨不是，這是因爲小倍爾納没有一件乾淨的　衫可以借給你穿的緣故。我現在笑着，可是當時祇要再過一分鐘，不，一秒鐘，你便已經没命了。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚丨丨那我現在就和你隔得遠啦。</p>
<p>敎父丨丨不許說。我竟講出一些蠢話來了。自從出了這回亂子以後，我便從來没有睡過一晚好覺。我害着失眠症了，這是我的處罰；我是應當受着這種處罰的。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚丨丨而我呢，敎父，我是不應當受這種處罰的，我很想睡着。</p>
<p>敎父丨丨睡呀，畜生，睡呀。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚丨丨你如果要我睡的話，敎父，那麼請你把我的手放鬆罷。等我睡熟之後再讓你抓着好了。並且請把你的腿子也拉開罷，因爲你腿上的毛把我弄得怪癢的。當别人觸着我的時候，我是無論怎樣也不能睡着的。</p>

<p>這大概是誰聽見了都喜歡的吧，中國政府將有一筆大收入，即是宋財長向美國財政善後銀公司，簽字所借的美金五千萬，</p>
<p>聽說事實是這樣，財宋向美所借巨欵，便得就地購買美國棉花與小麥，以救我棉荒與麥荒，且確信此項借欵，於雙方均有利益，旣可推銷美市塲之剩餘，復可獎勵中國人使用美國之棉麥，償欵期爲三年，延期給息五厘。</p>
<p>我國值此財政奇絀，羅掘俱盡之秋，得了美國救命活菩薩的恩賜？而且當地便得變買成棉與小麥，我們這些「有了早餐，便没了晚餐」，「遮了羞，便遮不了體」的芸芸衆生，何悉還不豐衣足食，鼓腹而歌，但是總覺得高鼻樑藍眼睛折交易，自來是極不容易沾惹的，若是硬要沾惹，結果，一定好像是敎育部審定過似的「老是自己吃虧」而且吃虧之後，遇着對方或第三者加以下問，還只好强以笑臉相向，連滿應曰，「多謝多謝，滿好滿好」！</p>
<p>就以前年水災賬麥來說吧，初開幾萬的巨大數字，未賞不足使一部分人色然大喜，尤其那些呌苦連天的災民們，但是結果怎樣？欵變成麥，麥復變成欵，由西洋運到東洋，由京滬分發到內地，經了這些手法和魔術之後，實際上，災民眞正得到的實惠，究竟有多少？可是債務人的資格，却勿論你災與不災，凡是同胞，均已不勞而已掙得，現在又如鐵汁滴在生肉上似的再加上一個「美金五千萬」，恐從此債上加債，利中生利，尙未出娘腹的乃子乃孫，亦將不得不預先接下「替人白做馬牛」的定銀了，</p>
<p>退一步說，去年豐收，以至穀賤傷農，事實昭昭，何來「麥荒」就是所謂「棉荒」亦不曾聽人十分說過，我尙須調查調查呢。</p>

<p>— 炳</p>
<p>古諺有曰：「聖人出，則黄河淸」。這，是否荒誕姑且帶住不表。且說當今天下，自「長期出，而中國大亂」。稽之往史，徵諸現實，半毫不爽，一絲不昧。</p>
<p>自咱們孫總理樹起滅淸旗旂，號召革命以還，伸出手來把大拇指挨次搯下去，足足有半百個年頭了。這其間，亂子出了不少，國家翻了無數的觔斗。但至今，大家都說革命没有成功，除了元老們已在唸經拜佛，懸藏遺敎，大享其淸平福。</p>
<p>這，恐就是「長期」的出典吧，至少作者是如此假定：過去已是五十年，未來誰也不能說定只要若干年革命眞會成功了。長期長期，中國的革命就算準是第一號長期。</p>
<p>隨「長期革命」以俱來，期間大致是民十五六年以後，便有「長期休飬」一套。這序幕大致上如此展開：要人之間，免不了政見有出入，一有出入，更不免明爭暗闔，結果一方失敗，他方得逞，失敗者意志消沈，倦政引退，成遠適異邦，或息跡界，輒曰：「長期休飬」。實則這序幕後所扮演的把戲，究莧怎樣，那只有請讀者去回憶已往的客觀事實。</p>
<p>「長期」畢莧是典有所出，繼承有自，眼見牠已隨時代而光大了。東洋兵那麼甘冒不韙，自前年九一八開頭，奪去了咱們的瀋陽，從此節節進襲，而奉天全省，而黑龍江，而整個東三省，而長城以北各地，險些兒平津也臨了危殆的境界，幸喜咱們的當軸幡覺悟，搖尾屈伏，這幾日才好像撥雲霧而見靑天，風聲不大鶴唳，風雨倖未滿城。然自咱們的當軸。骨子裏並不屈伏，「長期抵抗」，不是當今的禦侮大典麼。從九一八始，一直到現在，也許直到無盡期的未來，無論在那種塲合上，不都是「長期」「長期」「長期抵抗」之聲，洋洋乎盈耳麼</p>
<p>「長期」　至冠於禦侮衛國的抵抗上，本已極發揚光大的能事，似乎再没有出色的右套法寶了，事實不然。</p>
<p>幾天以來，我老在外面奔跑，頭一趟在北四川路遇到：兩個孩子槓着一方國旗大的布幕廣告，在街心遊，字幕如下：</p>
<p>××皮鞋公司</p>
<p>長期大減價</p>
<p>丨機會不可錯過丨</p>
<p>當時我看了又看，覺得「機會不可錯過」的一句，是多餘的話，實在與「長期」二字相抵觸。連日在靶子路，外攏渡橋又遇見兩次，「機會不可錯過」的一句話依舊還在，我滿想上前去提買意見，就是改爲「盍興乎來」，也要比較好些。伹我深恐那雙孺子不可敎，怕觸霉頭，自尋苦惱，不敢不敢，隨牠也罷。</p>
<p>於此可知「長期」不但是禦侮救國的大經，而竟已是商號招徠生意的法寶了。其將來的演進如何，眞是誰也不能預測呢。</p>
<p>歸面徧查王雲五氏大字典以及辭源續編，均尙垑「長期」大經條之詮註，良深遺珠之嘆，願辭晉家將來有以增補之。</p>
<p>話說轉來，自「長期出，而中國大亂」，讀者們，請看今日之中國！</p>

<p>— 經書</p>
<p>連自己也覺得奇怪，差不多已成了慣常的「醒早覺」，不知怎的一回事，今天要去逛吳淞，偏醒的特别遲丨丨我睜開眼睛的時候，已經七點過了五分。遛下牀來，聽見屋外的雨點，打着窗上的玻璃發出淸脆的聲音。</p>
<p>爲着自己是負責人之一，雖說我們已經有了「下雨作罷」的約言，然而我覺得仍有上車站跑一趟的必要。於是趕快洗臉，打電話，呌車子。還好，趕到車站，才七點二十分，距開車還有二十分鐘，在人的業林裏，很快樂的發現了承怡和惠成兩個，他倆各人提着一籃野餐用的乾糧。我問他們：「都來了没有！」他們簡短的答話是「就只我們兩個。」</p>
<p>「去，快去！我們只的一個同伴也去，何况我們現在已有了三個人呢！」這是我們共同的意思，所以我們毫不遲疑地大踏步的走進車廂裏。</p>
<p>當我們走上砲台灣海濱的時候，雨點史加狂驟，惠成和我有呢帽，只承怡光着頭，我就把雨衣遞給他，呌他披在頭上。於是我們繼續高歌着進行之曲一直走到砲台灣的盡頭。</p>
<p>雨，一刻不停的向我們進攻着，風，也像助紂爲虐的任情的呼吼，怒號：</p>
<p>我們單薄的衣衫都濕透了，臉上掛着點點晶瑩瑩的水珠，身子也感到些微的寒意；然而我們并没有覺得苦悶，我們也絕對没曾怨恨，咒詛，或是希望，祇求着老天，我們只覺得「喔，有趣！」</p>
<p>在風雨中，逛了好半天，我們又互相拿鏡箱的拍了好幾張照。肚子裏咕地地呌着了，我們才走到一家小茶館子裏拿出麵包罐頭來大嚼着。</p>
<p>十二點鐘洶景，我們已走上了從砲台灣到寶山縣的大道，天色慢慢放睛了，路上的游客也逐漸折增多，其實，天色的睛或雨，壓根兒我們對它就感不到痛癢：游客的多或寡，於我們的興致亦是絕對不生影響的，因爲，你們想，你們閉着眼睛靜靜的想想看，雨天的海濱，該是如何的美麗而雨於逛海濱又是如何富有詩的意味啊！這樣夠人滿足，難道我們還會說寂寞與不樂意嗎？</p>
<p>承怡因爲他還有些零碎的事，主張早些回家，我們也以爲有了相當的疲乏，自然贊成他的話。丨丨當我們重踏到閘北的時候，已是三點鐘了。</p>
<p>在往返的路程上，在火車裏，我們經過了幾年處去年「一二八」戰爭的戰塲，那裏，斷垣殘壁，觸目盡是，我們伸出頭去望着，望着，過了一處，又是一處，我們便都在想，但我們從没曾學過文人們不相干的憑悼，或是效着弱者們没出息的唏噓，我們僅僅這樣想：帝國主義對我們的威脅，只不過增進我們「反</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>帝」的情緒，和堅强「反帝」的决心！此外，帝國主義者們的收獲是有限而膚淺的。是啊，目前我們民族唯一的出路，除了一致在有組織的「反帝」的戰線上鬥爭外，還有甚麼辦法？</p>

<p>「長鼻子的來了。」</p>
<p>校長來的時，我們每是這樣地互相傳報着，並不是怕，倒是覺得有趣。</p>
<p>校長的鼻子的確是長得可以，一寸來高，半尺來長，顫巍巍地兀立在空中每逢他對下人震怒時，這條鼻子就總異趣地在空中振動，振動的使你有時膽戰心驚深怕他就要掉下來了。</p>
<p>當你和他會面時，最先使你認識的便是他鼻子的長；於是才注意到他那兩片勁攣地抖動着的厚嘴唇，一口拖泥帶水不知說什麼的話辭和其他一切。</p>
<p>初次來校找我們的朋友們，開口總就這樣驚異地：「你們校長的鼻子，怪長呀！」</p>
<p>來找我們的人數多，所以聽過這樣的話的次數也就不少，以至於使我們不好意思，反而怪這條鼻子的長終是本校的污點。不過有時却會這樣想，「也許本校靠着這條鼻子就快要出名了吧。」因爲本校，說來面紅，在市裏是並没其他特色，於是我們便甚以爲慰，把一切看不起他的事都忘掉，甚願他還是繼續着坐在那把交椅整天抄算着校賬的好。</p>

<p>編輯先生；</p>
<p>鄙人現在某錢莊爲學徒，從前祇肄業於初中二。學問淺薄，恐將來不能立足於社會，故得家長之同意，在××夜校補習俄文。然因終日操勞，加之心境關係，以致身體凋敝；每在讀書之時，覺精神恍惚，稍久則若欲瞌睡。讀數月，功等於零，想如此下去，終非久長之策。</p>
<p>鄙人每日六時起身，習字；九時辦公，至下午四時。七時赴校讀書，九時三刻，方能返店。其中以何時誚睡片刻，能使晚上精神振足？或有何提神之藥。以價廉而功效速者爲最宜。望先生指敎！專此順請大安，學生錢磬石謹上。</p>
<p>編者按：一個成年人，每天需要睡眠有時間，大約爲八小時。如其有了八小時的睡眠，還感到精神這振；那麼這一定是另有别的原因，並不因爲睡眠太少了。現在錢君每天六時起身，晚上九時三刻以後，倘使立即就寢，那麼尙有八小時的睡眠；論理是夠的了。不過在十時之後，六時以前，睡在床上的時候，應當把一切雜念驅散：切不可胡思亂想罷了。所以你要想在白天，找一個時間略睡片刻，我們不能贊成。這非但不需要，而且事實上辦不到丨太早了，不需要；太晚了，反致晚上失眠：而且有　業的人，白盡睡覺，成何體統呢？</p>
<p>我們勸你在上午六時至九時，或下午四時至七時的中間，要有適當的運動。我們在寫字間裏做事情的時候，工作的是腦經，四肢百體，差不多完全休息。我們在運動時，適得其反，四肢百體，充分運動，腦子則全部休息。這樣白天的時候，腦子與肢體，交換休息；到得晚上，再有八小時的睡眠，精神一定可以振足了。至於提神的藥，我們不敢介紹。一個没有病的人，用不着吃藥；而且提神藥大半含有刺激性，久用有害。你要是没有病象，勸你不要嘗試；即使自己覺得已有病象，不得不借助於藥石時，也得請醫生診治。藥房裏的「成藥」，十九是以不吃爲是。</p>

<p>— 凌鹤</p>
<p>二十五，二百五十元</p>
<p>一个人總得有一種消磨光陰的方法的，五夫人自從少爺不能像從前那樣整天的纏绵，唯一的消遣方法便是讀「紅樓夢」。和每一個小姐一樣，五夫人也希望得着美男子寶玉的鐘情，可是她並不同意黛玉走頭無路的哭泣，然而對於王熙鳳的爲人，到是十分欽佩的。不過她很慚愧；自己果然能像鳳姐那樣的精明强幹嗎？到底是没有充分把握的了。一想到這裏，也就將書本輕輕放下。呆呆的望着窗　發傻。其後又從枕邊拿起張文彬的照片看了一會兒，又不免重重的嘆了一口氣。</p>
<p>一個老媽子拿着一個紙條兒進來，說是外面有一部汽車在等着。五夫人接過那紙條兒一看，知道是二夫人那邊派了車子來接她去打牌。他想：「这到是很好的機會，同二夫人結識結識。一於是馬上打扮，立刻動身，坐上汽車，揚長而去。</p>
<p>汽車夫在開到二夫人家門口的時候，使勁的按了幾下喇叭，唑見司間巡捕立刻打開鐵門迎接，一直駛到石階前停下。五夫人提起斗蓬走下車來，馬上便有女僕前來侍候。走進二夫人的臥室，滿眼都是不曾見過的女人。不過她很聰明，知道那位北京話說得不大純熟的該是二夫人，雖然她完全是中國太太的打扮。再由於二夫人的介紹。才知道兩位年紀輕輕在姑娘是剛從北京來的大小姐和二小姐。自然這二位姑娘都很體面，尤其是大姐的拖着前額的短髮更是嫵媚，不過二小姐手裏抱着那雙全白的小貓，也很馴善可愛。</p>
<p>大家嗑着瓜子噴着紙烟的客氣一通，不久便移至外房坐上牌桌。柴檀桌子面上還蓋上一方絲質的桌布，没有什麼稀奇，不過那一副外面鑲着綠玉的麻雀，却是五夫人家裏没有的，仔細想來，未免慚愧。</p>
<p>一塲牌打下來，大概是因爲手氣不好的原故，五夫人足足輸了二百五十多元。不過五夫人自己知道，假如不是有意的給下家二夫人多吃幾張，二夫人是没有方法兒贏錢的。而且二夫人在一塲牌打過之後，居然和她很爲要好，這豈是一兩百塊可以買得着的？區區的二百五十餘元，算能什麼？所以我們的五夫人雖然輸了錢，仍然滿臉笑容的談笑大方。</p>
<p>在吃晚飯的桌子上，蘇部長很爲歡喜，因爲她們居然能夠如此和睦，加之</p>
<p>晚飯之後二夫人一定要他親自送五夫人回去，於是更加覺得自己的福　不小了。</p>

<h3 id="c271">恐怖片「猿王」的攝製 <a href="#c271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— 羅芬</p>
<p>拆穿西洋鏡原來如此</p>
<p>一九三三年的電影界中，又有許多的恐怖片出現。而其中的最恐怖一片，爲雷電華公司的出品「猿王」Ｈing　Hongo好萊塢的電影界中，有認爲「猿王」一片，實爲恐怖片中駭人之作，足以壓倒一切「龍虎鬭」「洪荒世界」「古屋怪</p>
<p>人」「科學怪人」等等伹是這一部影片是怎樣攝成的呢？即如了隻極大的人猿，高可齊天，抓死了許多人，還拿一個女子抓了去（飾女子爲藎蕾所飾）飾，後來想了許多方法擊死了這個大人猿，救了那女子的性命。當那大人猿爬上紐約最高的屋頂時，用了許多的飛機去轟炸，竟有一架飛機被大人猿毁，這樣的大人猿，怎樣攝製的呢？</p>
<p>「猿王」一片的攝片，完全是假的這是依靠了攝影師佈景師的技巧，用複雜的綴合攝片法，拼湊若干而成的，其中還依了光線的利用法，絲毫没有破痕流露，觀者决不致感覺到這部片子是假的，技術上的精巧，足以稱爲一九三三年的攝片術上的大傑作。</p>
<p>在「猿王」中的緊要一幕，那隻大人猿爬上了紐約高屋頂上，掌中抓住了女子，飛機到天空中轟擊，這一幕用七張片子連綴攝成，第一是在紐約的高屋上去拍攝了紐約天空的景緻，所有高的屋頂盡在片中。第二攝飛機飛在天空時的情形，然後第一第二兩片綴合復攝成一片。第三攝那碩大無朋的人猿時。用的是一隻極渺小的假猿。然後和初次綴合成的一片再互相綴合。最後才攝了一個女子橫倒的側影，再配上第二次綴合攝成的影片。如是一重一重，共用了七張片子，費了四次連綴覆攝的手續，祇要工夫深，鐵尺磨成鍼。工夫自然不小，然而成績是不能說不偉大的。</p>
<p>除了大人猿之外，還有四種怪獸，兇惡異常，爲上古世界所最可怕的動物，也是用了雛型拍攝，同其他的實地攝成的影片連綴複攝而成的。雖然「猿王」一片意義毫無，然其攝片之工作，足開藝術界之新紀元。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3 id="c272">評「淸白」 <a href="#c272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— 培根</p>
<p>因爲注重在淸白上發揮，所以一個摩登舞女，不愛面團團而擁有鉅資的軍閥丨師長丨而接受一個小鬍子獻給她的殷勤，仍念念不忘於畫師的舊情，這樣淸白的舞女，現社會上在找不出的。而這題材的次重要人物，畫師丨意想之頑固簡單，也是絕無僅有的。這片盡力在反面上着想，但也找不出可取，而社會的種種黑幕如提姦，暗殺，金錢和肉的誘惑等，倒演得淋漓盡致。</p>
<p>演員的表情，主角不過如此，其餘更覺平平而已。</p>
<p>舞塲經理的身分，似乎不應賣弄滑稽，逐客出門時翻個筋斗，更見唐突，這樣穿插，弄巧反成拙了。幾個賭徒的面部化裝，破綻不少，舞塲經理好像釘梢，原來到魏家做調人，從這樣引出做舞女的根由，很不自然。師長賄通飬父，私入舞女臥室，被人暗殺。僅費一刀</p>
<p>之力，似嫌不夠。舞女被中一刀，至少也有一聲喊救，僅隔一扇門的人，豈不會聽見？再她被刺倒在門外，好像是舞塲的門，但最後被一個酒醉的人抱去，却又不像是舞塲門，這所在實在有些模糊。盡師挾了一張畫像，跑來跑去，究竟爲的什麼？也莫明其妙。</p>
<h3 id="c273">談「淸白」 <a href="#c273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— 喩家卿</p>
<p>「淸白」這一個名詞是多麼的「高尙」與「尊貴」，這是聯華第四廠的出品。這片的大意是述一個窮畫師愛上了一個狐苦伶仃的女子。她被一個愛賭如命的人領飬着，外表上是他的女兒，實際上是他的「奴隸」，而又是他的「飬活器」，因爲他在賭塲上舞弊，被人逼不得已，只好把他的女兒去當舞女。因爲她太紅了所以閙出了一椿醋海風波的事件，這椿事件被窮畫師知道了，於是就和她决絕了，並且，諷刺她，奚落她，又說她不「淸白」不「純潔」，但是她到了死，仍舊是「淸白」「純潔」。</p>
<p>劇情是很平常，没有什麼指示，導演也没有什麼特殊技巧，小疵點倒也很多。攝影光線有幾處模糊，而佈景也很簡便。</p>
<p>演員如殷明珠表演雖好，但是飾一個十七八歲的妙齡少女，似乎太不合身份。羅克明上半部表情尙好，下半部尙缺面部表情。魏光　太過火，韓蘭根的滑稽，未免也有些做作，其餘無甚特點，演員均平平而已。</p>
<h3 id="c274">「淸白」觀後感 <a href="#c274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— 史斌</p>
<p>這部片子的劇旨，很有些使人捉摸不定，命名雖呌做「淸白」，但是看完了以後，却不免使人感到不「淸」楚而不明「白」。</p>
<p>字幕上告訴觀衆說：「琵琶是一個好女子，她願去做工，不肯去做給大衆擁抱的跳舞女」：但是我於銀幕上看到她那表演的舉動，似乎與其素志大相背反，豈不是一個値得注意的漏洞吧？</p>
<p>蕭畫師本來是很愛琵琶的，但是他後來知道她被監禁入獄了！見了琵琶非但不如以撫慰，而竟不分皂白的大大的責備她一頓，這難道也是爲着愛她嗎？</p>
<p>演員的表情殷明珠女士，表演最好，但是有一點，殷女士的靑春，已隨光陰而逝流了，在本片中，似乎不合那個少女，琵琶，的身份，但是還虧她能夠充分地形容出少女的天眞活潑，管是値得我們欽佩的。其餘如閔德張很是成功，羅克朋不過如此，韓蘭根却有些滑稽得過火了！</p>
<p>總而言之，這部影片，劇情是失敗了丨演員的表情是可取的，導演的手婉也是値得欽佩的。</p>
<h3 id="c275">觀「淸白」以後 <a href="#c275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— 亞化</p>
<p>「淸白」由但杜宇君導演，但君的確很能運用他的天才，把各個畫面很活動地展開，使得觀衆覺到美滿。但錢頭太快而浮，光線也澀滯些。</p>
<p>「淸白」因劇本結搆的不健全，和那些不需要的勉强穿插，使觀衆不能感覺緊張而得不到深刻的印象。</p>
<p>「淸白」的編劇者，是想把劇中的（琵琶）寫成個可憐身世的女郎，所以當畫片開塲之先，是寫十八年前琵琶還在襁褓之中，父因入獄，把琵琶寄與魏光爲飬女，魏光是個好賭殘暴的漢子，自然琵琶的境遇是很慘哀的。</p>
<p>飾琵琶的殷明珠，在飾少女的動作，未見活潑，而後飾的舞女很好。琵琶的情人蕭畫師（羅克明飾），表演很平常，因爲他的表演平常，和劇本分幕的散漫，所以這「湖白」的劇意「愛的焦點」，未能充分演出。全劇的重心旣失，以後各塲分幕都不能自然。</p>
<p>琵琶被馬師長設法誘到西方飯店的一段，攝法是很佳妙的，但是琵琶的舞容吃醋醋殺馬師長，因没有明白的寫出舞容對琵琶如何熱戀，所以覺得突如其來，觀衆們不知道那舞容爲什麼要殺馬師長。</p>
<p>劇情原想寫琵琶至死還是淸白之身，但是畫面並没有　明的寫出，使觀衆對於琵琶的死，只覺得她是不幸而没有一些悲憫性。</p>
<p>總之，但君運用的攝影技巧和布景，及許多小動作，是値得觀賞的，只可惜失敗在劇本上。</p>
<h3 id="c276">天一的兩部「三部曲」 <a href="#c276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— 草央</p>
<p>天一影片公司最近是在積極的轉變中。今後的出品，將完全放棄「追求」「蘭谷萍踪」的戀愛題材，而决然的走上電影觀衆所需要的大道，努力於「反封建」「反帝」的表演。尤著力於中國婦女之前途，與勞苦羣衆生活之暴露。</p>
<p>天一現在正在努力着的有兩部「三部曲」丨丨（一）「黄昏」「黎明」「生機」（二）「死路」「血路」「活路」。這一個消息，應該使得我們多少的歡欣啊，因爲這裏已明示着天一公司的轉變是整個偉大的轉變，而向着眞正的電影藝術之途勇猛前進了。</p>
<p>據聞，「黄昏」和「黎明」正在拍演，而「生機」一片已在首都公映，不日即將返滬。在這一個影片裏，導演邵醉翁，主角陳玉梅和配角袁美雲陸麗霞蕭正中張振鐸等，都表演着一個新的技巧，有有人說：「主演的陳玉梅從來没有這樣努力過。在這裏，她用盡了現在所有的力量了。」這張片子一定値得給我們注意着的了。「生機」的題材是：一個婦女是嫁給一個資產階級的丈夫的，平日裏受盡了那男人的氣和侮辱，於是她覺悟了她自己應走的大道，她終於和勞働階級的婦女去聯合起來，跳出黄金夢的被窩來前進到「生機」之路。詳細內容已載本刋四月二十五日稿內。</p>

<p>「羅宮春色」中女主角克勞考爾白女士，身長不過五尺五寸，重量一百零三磅，可以說是位嬌小玲瓏的女郎了。誰信她精於拳術呢。可是有一天她扮演（IＣover　the　Waterfrbot)中的潑女子，要和對方相打。導演吩咐克勞黛要對待對方女子，十二分粗魯。克勞黛說「我不願意眞的打她，我恐怕現實得太厲害了」。</p>
<p>導演看看她，說道：「你放心。再打重些，亦不至於打傷她」。克勞黛笑笑，準備廝打了。</p>
<p>「開麥拉！動作！」一陣喊。克勞黛看見對方的女子奔過來，不慌不忙地對準她的臉，一拳霍的過去。對方女子倒地而傷了。後來費了十幾分鐘，才把她救醒。</p>

<p>「這孩子眞可憐，她是没有母親的。我看她來到這裏，一天到晚都是愁眉不展。」裴的一個女僕，一面在給她整潔房間，一面這樣自言自語的說。「你說誰呀，」裴士問，「還不是那曼尼拉姑娘嗎！」女僕答。裴柏聽了這話，停頓了一會。然後對女僕說！「你去找她來，我有話對她說」。那女僕答應了一聲，一步一蹺的去了。</p>
<p>一會兒曼尼拉果然跟着女僕進來了。裴柏本來是坐在那裏看劵子的。看見了曼尼拉，她就含着笑容立將起來，走到曼跟前去。和曼握着手，說道：「曼尼拉，你初到此間，灔得什麼事情都不慣嗎？但是再住些時候就好了。你要快樂，不要悲觀！答應我嗎」？以一個多年没有享受母性之愛的曼尼拉；以一個正在追求着愛的姑娘，在這樣一處舉目無親的陌生地方，這些話兒，怎會不句句打入她的心坎呢！於是她感激，她流淚，最後竟伏在裴柏臂膀上，痛哭了一塲！</p>
<p>璫！璫！璫！就寢的鐘聲響了！學生們一個個穿着寢衣，走到床跟前去。裴柏女士，走進她所管轄的房間，先把電燈關了。然後對大家說道：「靜着，我來給你們那個晚别的吻了」！那許多學生，都蹲伏在床邊，雙手扶着床欄杆，好似小鳥等候老鳥哺食一樣，昂着頭，等候裴柏賜吻。最後一個，是挨到曼尼拉了！她的心，不覺頓時興奮起來；她的熱情，在胸中沸騰着；她那似倦的秋波，直向裴柏射着。她竟身不由主的抱着裴柏，把自己的口，對準裴柏的口，下勁的吻了一下，方才靜靜的安睡了。（未完）</p>

At 11 p.m. on the 3rd, they increased the number of heavy troops, concentrated guns and cannons, and launched a fierce attack on the Jinmachang and Xujia Chang areas, and are still attacking me this morning. It is found that Wenhui has launched military action without authorization and has been attacking day and night for more than 20 days. Our central government has been magnanimous and has not punished him, which has led to more and more fierce attacks, with no intention of stopping military operations and returning to the original defense. He only obeyed the order to stop the war in a telegram to deceive the Privy Council and deceive the people of the country. Although the central government is far away in Nanjing, Governor Liu is stationed in Yucheng. Please send aircraft to inspect, which will not be difficult to expose completely. If Xihou's telegram is false, please punish him for deceiving the central government. Wenhui's cessation of hostilities is not real. I earnestly request that strict military laws be enforced and effective measures be taken to stop the conflict as soon as possible. The telegraph is urgent and I await orders."

Because the military part of the two men's written reports must be reported to Chiang first, they must submit them to the government after returning to Beijing from Jiangxi. Ma told the Central News Agency reporter on the 7th, "Our anti-Japanese determination is unwavering. Whether we will go north to reorganize the old troops will be decided after visiting Chiang in Jiangxi. We will follow the orders of the central government. Although the North China ceasefire agreement has been signed, the Japanese army has invaded and occupied our four provinces and is making every effort to operate and cultivate strength. In the future, they may even invade north of the Yellow River, with the ambition to annex our country. I hope that our people will unite as one and take orderly steps to achieve success in resisting Japan, and the lost territories will not be difficult to recover."

<h3 id="e34">Director of Industry Talks About Ways to Relieve the Cotton Industry <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, Liu Yinpu, Director of Industry who attended the Shanghai Cotton Textile Industry Relief Meeting, talked about the relief methods for the cotton industry, which had already been decided. Banks will provide low-interest loans for capital turnover. However, raw material supply was very difficult at the meeting. Fortunately, Minister Song borrowed funds in the United States and designated four-fifths for the purpose of purchasing cotton, so the raw material problem has been solved. At most, the current national cotton yarn raw materials can only supply one month. The date for domestic cotton to enter the market is still far away. The Ministry of Finance has sent a telegram to Minister Song to expedite the first shipment of American cotton to meet urgent needs. According to statistics, the total number of yarn factories in China requires approximately 80 million dan of cotton annually, and domestic cotton production is only approximately 50 million dan, with the remainder needing to be purchased from overseas. Domestic cotton merchants have weak capital and are mostly unable to order large quantities of cotton materials from abroad. The success of this loan, with most of it used to purchase cotton for supply, has been highly praised by the cotton industry. After it is shipped in succession, it will be allocated evenly according to the needs of each yarn factory. The price will be slightly lower than that of cotton merchants ordering from abroad themselves. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing, A government spokesman told Reuters today that negotiations on the recent loan of US$50 million to purchase American cotton and wheat had been underway for a year, but were only successful recently when Song Ziwen visited the United States. He also said that this move was beneficial to both China and the United States. The United States could clear its surplus cotton and wheat, while China could alleviate its food shortage and develop its cotton industry. The central government has received telegrams from both the cotton and wheat industries in the country, all expressing welcome to this loan. (7th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>London, Today's Times editorial stated that the Shanghai merchants' criticisms of the US$50 million loan to China to purchase American cotton and wheat were endorsed by people here. The United States, like the United Kingdom, France, and Japan, is one of the banking consortiums of 1920 and has undertaken to share any investment in China with each other, but only for public fundraising and those that use China's national income as collateral. The investments of private banks are naturally not within the scope of this agreement. The American loan now has no reason to be considered a public fundraising, but if it uses national income, such as customs surcharges, as collateral, it seems to hinder the policy of international cooperation set by the banking consortium.

<p>Ming</p>
<p>The political crisis in Europe has deepened since Hitler came to power in Germany early this spring. The great disaster of war seems almost inevitable. Moreover, due to their dissatisfaction with the Treaty of Versailles, the diplomatic strategies of Germany and Italy towards France, the three small countries in Central Europe, and Poland have become consistent. Before the outbreak of the Great War in 1914, the only tinderbox in Europe was the Balkan Peninsula. Now, from the Free City of Danzig to the Banat region, thick smoke is billowing everywhere, showing signs of an imminent explosion. The task of the British Prime Minister's visit to Rome is to stabilize the European political situation and transform the world's economic panic. Therefore, on April 31, the proposal for a Four-Power Pact to rebuild Europe was put forward.</p>
<p>The main purpose of this pact is to ease the political unrest in Europe and the dissatisfaction of Germany and Italy, to revise the Treaty of Versailles by peaceful means, and to eliminate the biggest unstable factors in Western Europe. It also aims to achieve success in arms reduction and progress in the World Economic Conference. Article 2 of the pact includes: "The four countries, Britain, France, Italy, and Germany, acknowledge that in situations where disputes arise between nations, the Covenant of the League of Nations shall be the standard for revising various peace treaties in principle, but it must be within the framework of the League of Nations to promote mutual benefit and coordinate interests." This is what France has always advocated. Article 3 states that "Germany's demand for equal armament rights must be gradually realized only after the International Disarmament Conference achieves considerable success." This is also in line with France's position. Previously, the five powers, Britain, the United States, France, Germany, and Italy, were the leaders in disarmament. After Germany withdrew due to the dispute over equal armament rights, the Disarmament Conference effectively only involved Britain, France, and Italy. Even in terms of Western European relations, the absence of Germany would lead to a deadlock. Therefore, the "gradual understanding" proposal not only aims to bring Germany back to the table but also hopes for a joint understanding with Austria and Bulgaria. Article 4 stipulates that the four powers jointly pledge to take consistent action on all political or non-political issues, whether in Europe or outside Europe, that are related to the four countries. Thus, the effectiveness of this pact may extend beyond the "Locarno Treaty," and joint action will be taken on issues outside Europe. Its implicit meaning lies in the preparation for launching political attempts and has serious implications for the redivision of the world market. However, if these four powers can truly work together in a consistent manner, it is indeed possible to overcome the current contradictions in Europe. Unfortunately, the actual problems are never as simple as the ideal, and the intense confrontation and conflict are not easily eliminated at the negotiating table. Let us examine the current situation in Europe. Since the Great War, the defeated countries of Germany, Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria have been bound by peace treaties, constantly thinking about breaking these chains to rise again. In 1913, Germany's annual output of various minerals in Silesia was 40 million tons of coal, 100,000 tons of iron ore, and 1 million tons of zinc and lead. Thirty-seven smelting furnaces produced 600,000 tons of pig iron and 1 million tons of steel. Other machinery and chemical industries were extremely prosperous. However, with the cession of Silesia, the metal industry suffered a major blow. Revenge against France is impossible, and industrial recovery is also hindered. In addition, the issue of the Polish Corridor makes it even more difficult for the Germans to forget about armament. This is what the Germans cannot forget for a single day, and it is precisely the incitement of Hitler that has been able to achieve rapid success. The old territory of Hungary has been carved up by Yugoslavia and Romania, and its desire to revise the borders and reclaim the Banat region is growing day by day. Therefore, its unity with Germany and Italy is becoming increasingly close. As for Italy, it was originally one of the victorious countries, but it is angry about the unequal distribution and wants to maintain its hegemony over the Adriatic Sea. Therefore, Albania and Dalmatia on the opposite shore must be completely under its control, and it is unwilling to let go, thus becoming enemies with Yugoslavia. This is the so-called eastward policy of Italy, which can only be realized by revising the borders of Central Europe. Therefore, the foreign policies of Germany and Italy, the Danube Federation, and the organization of the Balkan Federation have similar interests and are approaching each other, taking the same steps to confront France, Poland, and the Little Entente. On the other hand, victorious France's fear and hatred of Germany has a long history and is not easily eradicated. The demand for "security guarantees" is the central policy of French international diplomacy. Poland is virtually an ally of France. Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Romania have all directly seized old Hungarian territories. If the Treaty of Versailles is indeed revised, the rights and interests of the Little Entente will be harmed. Therefore, the three countries are united to jointly restrain Germany and Italy. Moreover, France and Poland are bound to help them in terms of both strength and reason. Thus, the ambitions of Germany and Italy are unlikely to be realized immediately.</p>
<p>Even if this Four-Power Pact is smoothly signed, the excessive internal contradictions, as mentioned above, are enough to hinder European peace and incite world war. Therefore, the Four-Power Pact is only superficially pursuing peace, which may reduce political disputes at the World Economic Conference, but its actual condition remains the same as before. The greatest effect of this pact is no more than a sedative, giving a frightened and uncertain Europe a moment of stability.</p>

<p>Special Tax Increased on Cotton Cloth Imports</p>
<p>Japan's Anti-British Sentiment Continues to Grow</p>
<p>Shimla: The Indian government announced that the minimum emergency special tax on plain, undyed cotton cloth not manufactured in the United Kingdom will be increased from 50% to 75% ad valorem. This measure is due to the depreciation of the Japanese yen and the intense competition of Japanese goods in India, which has affected the Indian cotton cloth industry and several other industries. The announcement mentioned the inapplicability of the 1904 India-Japan Commercial Treaty, but the Indian government reaffirmed its willingness to discuss the current situation in order to resolve the problem. (7th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The increase in import duties on Japanese cloth announced by the Shimla government has caused great indignation among Japanese businessmen. Coupled with the anti-Japanese movement by the British cotton goods industry, the anti-British sentiment in Japan is growing stronger. Japanese newspapers are supporting domestic industrialists and condemning the partiality of British merchants. However, the political circles remain calm, believing that the World Economic Conference is about to open, and trade talks between Britain and Japan will also be realized. The British government will definitely use its restraining power. (7th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will discuss countermeasures after receiving a detailed report on the issue of India's increase in cotton cloth tariffs and will lodge a protest with the Indian government. Tsuda, President of Kanebo Spinning, said that while Japan is working to cooperate with Britain to resolve trade issues, the Indian government suddenly and arbitrarily increased tariffs, which is a joint British-Indian effort to exclude Japanese goods. This increase in tariffs can be regarded as an ultimatum from Britain and India to Japanese cotton merchants. We have no choice but to consider the final means. Kawaguchi, representative of the Japan-India Economic Association, said that there is no denying that the Lancashire cotton merchants of Britain are behind India's increase in tariffs. India is using the pretext of protecting its industries to exclude Japanese goods, and the Netherlands, Italy, and Germany are also affected. (7th Jiji News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Today at 1:00 PM, the Textile Federation held a special committee meeting to discuss countermeasures regarding India's tax increase.

Therefore, the general opinion on the Anglo-Japanese trade agreement is to kick it away. (7th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>

The proposal to ban the shipment of arms and other issues previously raised were not discussed today, nor was a firm date set for the next meeting. There were many absentees among the committee members today. Representatives from Turkey, Poland, Portugal, Panama, Canada, Hungary, and the Irish Free State were not present.

<p>Geneva: The League of Nations Advisory Committee sent a notice to the governments of various countries regarding the non-recognition of puppet organizations, which mentioned ① the issue of the "Manchukuo" puppet organization participating in various international conferences, postal affairs, and postage stamps; ② international non-recognition of the puppet organization's currency; ③ how to deal with the issue of foreign concessions and personnel dispatches in Manchuria arising from recognition; ④ passports and consular status; ⑤ the application of the import and export certification system stipulated in the 1925 Geneva Opium Conference and the 1931 Disarmament Conference. The above notice was sent to all member states of the League of Nations, as well as non-member states that are signatories to the Kellogg-Briand Pact or the Nine-Power Treaty. The Advisory Committee believes that although it is only responsible for providing recommendations to the governments of member states, based on the League of Nations General Assembly's hope that the signatories of the above two treaties will also be consistent with member states in their actions and attitudes when necessary, it is also notified together.

<p>It has always been the basic policy of the Empire to contribute to the maintenance of world peace and the promotion of human welfare.

The intentions of the Empire Government, I believe, are in complete agreement with the noble aspirations of the President, whose purpose is to maintain world peace. As for the various stages mentioned in the President's communique, concrete opinions will be presented at any time as necessary. The Empire Government earnestly hopes that the above two major conferences will quickly reach a fair and reasonable solution, so that the world can escape the difficult situation it is currently encountering.

<p>Roosevelt Steamer: The US delegation to the Economic Conference indicated today that the US President had informally agreed with politicians from several countries during talks at the White House the other day on the use of silver as a reserve for central banks. According to US representative Pittman, this informal and non-binding understanding will be submitted to the Economic Conference for discussion. He hopes that one of the results of its adoption in the future will be to stipulate a worldwide gold-silver ratio. Currently, the understanding does not yet extend to the issue of the ratio of the two precious metals. Its purpose is only to conserve gold. It is planned to stipulate that 25% of the US banknote reserves be gold and 5% be silver. The clothing country also handles it in the same way, but the gold-silver ratio should be slightly different. Central banks of various countries can stabilize the price of silver according to this plan. Even if the market price of silver still inevitably fluctuates slightly, it is not difficult for various banks to equalize the market by buying and selling silver, so that the rise and fall of the price of silver are always within the prescribed limits. If the price of silver falls too much, the central bank can purchase silver, so that the actual amount reaches 5% of the amount of banknotes issued. If the price of silver rises too much, the central bank can sell silver to stabilize the market. According to this method, the use of silver is broad, and its price can be raised slightly compared to the present. Mr. Pitt hopes that the price of silver may be raised to a level that is profitable for silver producers, but he is still unable to say for sure whether a gold-silver ratio can be adopted at the meeting in the future. Moreover, even the understanding between President Roosevelt and the politicians of various countries is not an agreement to adopt this plan, but only recognizes it as an acceptable basis for discussion.

<p>Whether to Pay or Not is Still Undecided</p>
<p>Eagerly Awaiting the US to Provide a Way Out</p>
<p>London: The British Cabinet is scheduled to convene a special meeting on Friday to discuss the payment of debt to the US, which is due on June 15. The government expects that the US will have a statement on the war debt issue on that day. (7th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>London: The question of whether or not the UK will pay the June installment of debt to the US still seems to be largely undecided. Although the payment date is only eight days away, the final decision has not yet been made. The British Parliament is scheduled to reopen on June 13, just two days before the payment is due. It is expected that the Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain will announce the government's decision to Parliament at that time. (7th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington: People at the White House claimed that as of now, the US government has not received any proposals from the debtor countries regarding the issue of resolving the war debt due on June 15. According to news from the UK, regarding the debt due on June 15, the British Cabinet must first know what the US expects of the UK before it can make any decision. US officials are quite surprised by this news and said that when the Hoover moratorium was passed by Congress, Congress voted on a resolution stipulating that war debts should not be reduced or cancelled. Roosevelt therefore did not make any suggestions to the debtor countries, but stated that he was prepared to consider any proposals. Since the debtor countries have not made any proposals, the US government can only maintain its position and wait quietly for the payment due on June 15. Moreover, the US Agricultural Relief Act contains provisions allowing debtor countries to repay part of their debt in silver. After the devaluation of the US dollar, the debtor countries have also indirectly benefited. The government is eager to understand the attitude of the various debtor countries, because the US Treasury needs a huge sum of 100 million yuan on June 15 to repay public debt and plans to issue short-term treasury bills to cope with it. The amount of treasury bills will depend on the payment situation of the various debtor countries. (6th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>London The Financial Times today published an article criticizing the 1932 report of the Chinese government's Purchasing Committee in London. In that year, the committee used 550,000 pounds in British currency, and the total expenditure has now reached 750,000 pounds, with 3.7 million pounds remaining, ready to purchase British-made goods. The newspaper emphasized that this move is of great value from an occupational point of view. The newspaper also mentioned the matter of attracting Chinese students to study in England, stating that American industries have greatly benefited from Chinese students studying in the United States, because when they return to their country after completing their studies, they tend to purchase machinery that they are familiar with. If England were to follow America's example, it would certainly be able to promote the sale of British products. The committee's report has now been sent to China, accompanied by an article from Guo Taiqi, the Chinese Minister to England, as Guo is the chairman of the committee. The report details the various matters handled by the committee in accordance with the exchange of documents between China and Britain in 1930 regarding the use of the British portion of the Boxer Indemnity, and explains that the chairman went to Geneva on official business, so all affairs were temporarily presided over by the Acting Chargé d'affaires Chen. In that year, the committee held several meetings of the technical and financial subcommittees, as well as two plenary sessions. (7th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Managing Privately Manufactured Arms</p>
<p>Another Major Point of Contention Resolved</p>
<p>Geneva The United States has fully agreed to France's request for the issuance of licenses and strict management of privately manufactured arms. Another major point of contention within the General Disarmament Commission has been resolved. When France initially proposed this, it was highly doubtful whether the United States would agree. Until today, the French representative repeatedly stated that France's signature on the Disarmament Convention would depend on whether private companies could be strictly managed. The US representative, Davis, then declared that the United States was prepared to accept this proposal. This move by the Americans can be seen as a change in their consistent stance, as according to the French plan, the export and manufacture of arms will be subject to strict management. This proposal will now be included in the draft of the Disarmament Convention. It is expected that Britain will not object, as Britain's arms exports have always been managed by the government. The General Commission will probably adjourn within this week, while the drafting committee will continue its work. (6th National Telegram)</p>

<p>But Germany Still Holds Reservations</p>
<p>Paris The semi-official summary of the Four-Power Pact is as follows: The preamble states that the main purpose is to give greater effect to the procedures stipulated in the Covenant of the League of Nations, and adds an agreement that the four powers shall not infringe upon the rights of other countries. The treaty has five articles: ㈠ England, France, Italy, and Germany agree to cooperate; ㈡ stipulates the exchange of views regarding the application of the provisions of the League of Nations Covenant, especially Article 10 (maintaining the territorial status quo), Article 16 (sanctions against aggression), and Article 19 (revision of treaties); ㈢ stipulates that if the Disarmament Conference fails, the four powers must consult with each other to seek a solution to the pending issues; ㈣ the four powers may consider economic issues in Europe in which they have a common interest; ㈤ stipulates that this treaty is valid for ten years, and if no notice of termination is given at the end of the eighth year, the treaty may be extended for another ten years. (7th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome It seems difficult to know within a few hours whether all four powers will participate in the pact. Germany has requested that the preamble of the pact be slightly modified. The French ambassador to Italy, Jouvenel, has now sent the German request to Paris for instructions. Rome hopes that Germany's formal objections to the pact will not prevent it from being signed today. Generally, people are anxiously awaiting Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's declaration in the Senate. The Italian Prime Minister must wait until all objections to the pact have been eliminated before he can make a declaration in the Senate. (7th Havas Dispatch)</p>

According to the Italian Prime Minister, negotiations have reached a stage where the pact is sure to be concluded in a way that is imaginable. If necessary, he will speak tomorrow. At the same time, the Paris cabinet today instructed the French ambassador to Italy to accept the current draft, which is also acceptable to Britain. It is expected that a notice of Germany's agreement will also be received soon, at which time the pact can be formally established. (7th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>London Germany still has reservations about the Four-Power Pact because the content of the pact is completely different from the original draft proposed by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, especially because it does not contain satisfactory clauses regarding Germany's demand for equality, and may refuse to sign it. (7th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris The date for the completion of the Four-Power Pact proposed by Mussolini to guarantee peace in Europe is not far away, because England, Italy, and France have already accepted the pact, and Germany may not openly oppose it. It is said that Article 3 of the pact, which relates to disarmament, is extremely moderate in its new form, merely stating that if disarmament fails, the signatory countries will meet to discuss the situation. According to a Reuters dispatch from Berlin, the news that the French government had agreed to sign the pact arrived in Berlin too late, so the stock exchange was not affected.

The secret society members would kneel and bow before their leaders, who would grant them seats and thank them for sitting. The southern faction was in the Suncun area, and the northern faction was in the famous strategic location of Muling Pass. After the government troops surrounded and suppressed them, they sent representatives to see me, requesting to return to farming and abolish all religious titles, only asking that the government troops withdraw slightly, giving them a way out, and not to pursue the past. I have agreed. They have now begun to disband, but a fundamental solution must be sought to avoid a resurgence.

<p>His Wife Hit by Four Bullets, Chauffeur Dies</p>
<p>▲ National Telegram, 7th, Athens: Former Greek Prime Minister Venizelos and his wife were traveling by car out of the city today when they were suddenly shot at nine kilometers from Athens. Mrs. Venizelos was hit by four bullets, but all were minor injuries. The chauffeur was also slightly injured. One of the guards was fatally wounded and died shortly after. The assailant is believed to be a relative of someone executed during Venizelos's term in office. The assassination was clearly planned in detail. After discovering that the Venizelos couple would be traveling in the countryside today, they waited on the road in a car. When their car drove between the Venizelos couple's car and the escort car, they immediately opened fire on Venizelos, firing more than sixteen bullets. Venizelos quickly hid under the car and tried to pull his wife down with him, but unfortunately, she had already been hit by four bullets, but none were fatal. Afterwards, the police were immediately called to pursue and arrest the assailant, but they had already driven into the countryside and have not yet been apprehended. An examination of the car revealed that the seats had been hit by a total of twelve bullets. Venizelos's escape from harm can be described as extremely close. After the incident, the chauffeur immediately drove the car back to the city and sent Mrs. Venizelos to the hospital to remove the bullets. Mrs. Venizelos was still able to sleep peacefully in the evening, and it seems that there will be no problems. Upon hearing the report, the police immediately investigated and arrested communist leaders, because Venizelos had severely suppressed the communist party during his term in office and executed many people, so it is expected that this was a retaliatory conspiracy by communists.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, 7th, Athens: Greek politician Venizelos, who has served as prime minister eight times and has a high reputation, was shot at last night while returning to Athens from Kifissia with his wife. His wife and the chauffeur were injured, but Venizelos himself was unharmed. It is reported that Venizelos, who is now sixty-nine years old, resigned as prime minister due to the violent coup carried out by General Hadjikyriakos, and was succeeded by Tsaldaris. He married his current wife in 1921.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Japanese Publishing Industry Discusses the Dangers of Military Clique Dictatorship <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Army Ministry General Staff Controls Government Meetings</p>
<p>If There Is No Resistance to the Military Clique, Japan's Future Is Worrying</p>
<p>Is Economic Power Enough to Defeat First-Class Powers?</p>
<p>Japan Should Abandon the Inferior Mentality of the Orient</p>
<p>The Yulin Daily's Tokyo correspondent reports that the "Liberation Magazine" published in June will contain two very interesting essays. Reading them reveals that the Japanese do not fully agree with the actions of their military clique and its followers. The reporter, with the kind permission of an employee of the magazine, was shown the contents of the two articles so that readers of the Xiaolin Daily could see them. There are inconsistencies in the writing of the two articles, which shows that the censor has made deletions and modifications. The main points of the two articles are recorded below:</p>
<p>One article, written by Arahata, discusses the resignation of Foreign Minister Arita, which was actually due to disagreements with Foreign Minister Uchida regarding the handling of the China issue and the Japan-Manchuria-Russia negotiations. The article states that the discord among the authorities in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is not a matter of one day or two. As the issue of Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations emerged, this conflict became more acute. Most of the senior officials in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs disagreed with Japan's declaration of withdrawal. Those who were solely under the command of the military clique were not. The conflict between the military and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is well known. At the beginning of the Manchurian Incident, the two sides were unable to tolerate each other. The military could no longer tolerate Shidehara's moderate diplomatic tactics, and drew their swords and declared a public break with him. This is why Shidehara retreated when he saw the opportunity. The author ridicules Matsuoka's final set of tricks in Geneva, which is to say that Japan is now the first line of defense against the possibility of China's redization. Matsuoka also said that if the League of Nations puts Japan in an isolated position, then Annam, India, and Egypt will not be able to safely remain under the power of imperialism. His words are foolish and laughable, and fully reveal Japan's entire policy towards Manchuria. The author's intention is that the Manchurian affairs actually show us that Japan's foreign policy is a transformed domestic policy. Since the European War, military preparations have been repeatedly reduced, and the power of the Ministry of the Army has greatly weakened. The power of the various political parties has continued to grow, resulting in a relative disadvantage. Therefore, the military has devoted all its efforts to resisting the successive foreign ministers, and Shidehara's diplomatic policy, which advocated cooperation with Europe and the United States to reduce the burden of military preparations, was especially opposed by the military. The steps to force Japan to withdraw from the League of Nations are actually nothing more than seeking to maintain the political power that the military clique temporarily enjoys today. The article concludes by saying that the foreign policy of the Army General Staff (Arahata did not mention this organization, because the censor did not allow it, so Arahata only used a certain organization to replace it, but it is clear where its intention lies.) now controls the government, parliament, and all speaking organs of Japan, and has transformed Foreign Minister Uchida from a soft rubber doll into a steel robot. The military clique not only monopolizes diplomatic power, but also draws huge sums of money from an unprecedented budget to expand military preparations. If the Japanese people do not quickly awaken and unite to resist, then Japan is in danger of being tossed about by the wind and rain. Another article, written by Yonebito, wonders whether the people of the country really know that they are currently encountering a serious difficulty, not only actually confronting one or two countries, but also confronting the whole world. However, few journalists or publishers with a little reputation have the courage to firmly oppose the government's current policy at this important turning point in the country's diplomacy, and to inform the people of the crisis of continuing this kind of radical policy. It is truly regrettable that even if one or two journalists have this "dangerous thought," no newspaper dares to disclose it. Although, according to what he knows for sure, it cannot be said that all Japanese people agree with the current so-called national policy. For example, Osaki is one of those who firmly oppose it. (It is reported that Osaki has been a member of parliament since Japan established a party government, and has once served as Minister of Justice. He has lived in England for a long time and has just returned to the country.) Furthermore, Mogi, the former chairman of Yokohama Mogi Company, also greatly doubts whether the authorities' current policies are well-considered. He believes that as a result of the development of imperialism, Europe has already been cleared, and in Asia and other places, it is being slowly cleared by the United Kingdom and the United States. Japan is once again trying to implement an extremely evil new form of imperialism on the East Asian continent. He believes that Japan, with nations such as China and India that are trying to rise up as neighbors, is currently in an extremely difficult position, and its actions must be extremely cautious so as not to leave regrets for the future. He asks whether it is wise to establish a Monroe Doctrine in East Asia to resist the regionalism of the natural development between nations, and doubts whether this kind of Monroe Doctrine and radical policy will be a reaction to world peace. He believes that as China and India are progressing along the path of capitalism, Japan's establishment of this kind of Monroe Doctrine, even if the world powers stand by and watch, is not known whether it will be beneficial to Japan. He also said that Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations at this time can be seen as Japan's diplomacy confronting world diplomacy and world public opinion. This move will not help to truly resolve the disputes between China and Japan, and while China remains in the League of Nations, he actually doubts whether Japan can favorably resolve the disputes between China and Japan by following the current policy. In practice, is it feasible? He then asks whether Japan can isolate itself from the rest of the world, whether it can continue to ignore the Kellogg-Briand Pact</p>
<p>and the Nine-Power Treaty indefinitely, and whether it can implement its continental policy as it pleases, regardless of others. He doubts this deeply, speculating that once Japan is forced to fight against a well-equipped country, its current isolated position is tantamount to fighting the whole world. Japan may be able to win a temporary victory, but the European War has already shown us that modern warfare is determined by economic power and endurance. I sincerely hope that those who believe that Japan can defeat truly first-class powers will pay attention to this. The authorities in charge have undoubtedly conducted a detailed investigation into the country's economic strength, but even with this economic strength, can they be sure that it can definitely support it for a long time without fatigue, or do they think that Japan's industry can only obtain raw materials from Manchuria and is enough to be self-sufficient? But who can prove the reliability of this statement? He believes that there are now those who do not hope for war, but warns those in Japan who want to fight that they must be prepared for the disaster of land sinking before they can do so. He believes that as a result of Japan's war, it will only impoverish its people and exhaust its wealth, leading to the complete collapse of the existing social order. Yonebito finally advocates cooperation between China and Japan to break the current situation of warlord separatism in China, believing that the ideal Sino-Japanese relationship can only be achieved when the economic activities of the two major nations can respect each other, need each other, and have considerable understanding. And he admits that the realization of this ideal Sino-Japanese relationship will take at least several decades. During this period, Japan should strive to cooperate with other nations more sincerely than before, and completely abandon the inferior mentality of the Orient.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Japanese Military Withdrawal Is Quite Slow <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>(Summary)</p>
<p>If There Is Sincerity, the Withdrawal Should Be Expedited</p>
<p>After the signing of the Sino-Japanese armistice agreement, our army has complied with the agreement and withdrawn separately. The various armies have gathered in Pingxiao, and will soon be demobilized and return to their original defenses. A portion of the Northeast Army has been transferred to Zhuozhou and other places on the Pinghan Line. The rest of the main force will also be divided into defense zones and stationed in appropriate locations. The Japanese army currently stationed on the Jixian line is the Hattori Brigade. The 16th Division of Puqi is stationed in Fengrun, Baodi, Sanhe, and other places. The 8th Division of Nishi Yoshiichi is stationed in the Miyun area. The area of Sanhe and Miyun is the area where the main force of the Japanese army is concentrated. There are not many Japanese troops on the front of the Beining Railway. Near Lutai, there are only puppet troops led by Li Jichun and Zhao Lei, totaling about two to three thousand people. The Japanese army's withdrawal is divided into three steps: first, the heavy artillery is withdrawn, then the baggage is withdrawn, and finally the infantry can be withdrawn. Although Japan has claimed to be withdrawing troops in recent days, only a portion has been withdrawn from Fengrun, Baodi, Yutian, and other places. Others are still claiming to be measuring and transporting baggage and heavy artillery, and there is no intention to withdraw far away. It is said that because of the continuous rain in recent days, the roads are muddy, and each division of the Japanese army's heavy artillery has about five or sixty doors, plus the attached bulky military supplies, the number is also quite large, and transportation is difficult. This may be the actual situation, and it is not known. Although the demobilization of our army is in active preparation, the war-time equipment is scheduled to be completed by the 16th of this month. However, whether it will be implemented as scheduled depends on the withdrawal of the Japanese army. It is expected that the Japanese army will withdraw outside the Guan within a month, at the earliest also in two weeks. As for the issue of the disposal of the puppet army, although the Japanese side has stated that it can be disposed of by our side, the difficult situation is not just one aspect. The other side can only not provide relief to this kind of army at the highest limit. If we want it to help us to resolve it by force, it will be difficult to do. In the future, even if we respond with force, but due to the relationship of the non-armed zone, sometimes the force is not enough, it can come and go freely, and it is difficult for us to respond. Before the Sino-Japanese issue is fully resolved, I am afraid that it will not be easy to put it out immediately. As of today, the 6th, the tracks of the Beining Road, Tangfang, and other stations have been repaired. The Luanhe Grand Iron Bridge has been repaired by the Japanese army and restored to its original state. If the puppet army issue can be resolved as soon as possible, the Beining Road train can reach Tangshan to the east, and the Pingyu transportation will be difficult to restore for a while.

<h3 id="e82">Preliminary Preparations for the Establishment of the Political Affairs Commission <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Likely to be Established in the Shortest Possible Time</p>
<p>Central Government Formulates Organizational Outline</p>
<p>Beiping Dispatch: Since Huang Fu was appointed to head the Beiping Political Affairs Reorganization Committee on the 17th of last month, nearly twenty days have passed. Initially, due to the military situation, pressing matters had to be addressed urgently, leaving no time for arranging committee affairs. The guests received daily were almost exclusively military or government personnel. Among the key figures, Huang Shaoxiong was frequently with He Yingqin discussing military matters, while Wang Kemin has been bedridden at Peking Union Medical College after injuring his eye a few days ago. Yu Xuezhong, Zhang Zhitian, Wang Yitang, Zhang Boling, and Wang Shuhan, who were in Tianjin, specifically came to Beiping to meet Tang Erhe. Liu Zhe, Lu Dangping, Song Zheyuan, and Fu Zuoyi also occasionally visited. Ding Wenjiang will soon head south, then proceed to the United States, and seemingly has no attention to committee affairs. Zhou Zuomin is in Shanghai urging his return, while Wang Boqun is ill in Shanghai. Li Shizeng, Zhang Puquan, and Enhe Batu are also not present. Han Fuqu and Xu Yongchang, due to their heavy duties as chairmen, will likely only come when meetings are necessary, although they maintain frequent contact and provide updates. As the ceasefire agreement concluded, North China is transitioning from military to political affairs, so the Political Affairs Commission is now actively preparing for its establishment in the short term.</p>
<p>Tracing the origins of the Political Affairs Commission, it evolved from the previous Political Subcommittee to the Political Affairs Committee under Zhang Hanqing. However, the Political Affairs Committee also included many military figures. With the establishment of the Military Affairs Subcommittee, military personnel, except for provincial chairmen, mostly belonged to the Military Affairs Subcommittee, and the Political Affairs Commission became a purely political organ. The Political Affairs Commission is responsible for reorganizing North China's political affairs and operates as a committee system. However, the organizational law emphasizes the chairman as the central figure, necessitating a precise internal organizational structure. Previously, there was a separate Finance Committee, which has now been merged into the Finance Department. The Political Affairs Commission also had departments for political affairs, confidential matters, and Mongolian and Tibetan affairs, which are now replaced by the Political Affairs Department. According to the organizational law, there are three departments: Political Affairs, Finance, and Secretariat. The Finance Department is the successor to the Finance Committee and is headed by Vice-Chairman Wang Kemin, so personnel matters are already settled. Wang Shuhan, head of the Political Affairs Department, previously came to Beiping, but departmental affairs are still under discussion. The Secretariat is central to the Political Affairs Commission's affairs, as Finance and Political Affairs deal with subordinate provinces and cities, while the Secretariat oversees all internal matters. Secretary-General He Qigong, who serves as the Mayor of Beiping, is very familiar with the local situation. During the organization, it is planned to divide the department into four sections: Documents, General Affairs, Public Relations, and Translation. The Councilors' Office is directly under the Committee, comprising all councilors, advisors, consultants, and specialists, whose main tasks are research, investigation, compilation, and review.</p>
<p>The Political Affairs Commission is the highest administrative organ of the Executive Yuan stationed in Beiping, governing four provinces and two cities, wielding significant power. However, it is an overarching body, with local authorities responsible for implementing measures. The commission merely issues directives, resolves doubts, and makes decisions. Its sole critical task lies in managing crises and uniting factions. From a direct perspective, it is respected but not intimately involved, while from a lateral perspective, it is both observed and respected. However, Chinese politics have always been fraught with factionalism and complex interpersonal relationships, making coordination and maneuvering difficult.</p>
<p>The Political Affairs Commission's location is currently being arranged in the west wing of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Once established, the various departments will move in. Before the formal establishment, a few individuals are handling affairs in Fengze Garden in Zhongnanhai, a former imperial palace. After the revolution, it belonged to the Presidential Palace, serving as a reception area or the office of the Secretary of State. After the Northern Expedition and the capital moved to Nanjing, it became a park and was fully opened to the public. The Zhongnanhai office was established here. When Huang Fu came to Beiping, it was used as his headquarters, conveniently located near He Yingqin's residence in Rentang Hall. Fengze Garden does not have many buildings. The front is Yinian Hall, and the back is Hanhe Hall. Before the commission is established, work is being done in the headquarters. This quiet old building is once again filled with guests, somewhat restoring its former glory.</p>
<p>The organizational outline of the Political Affairs Commission has been formulated and promulgated by the Central Government. The original text is as follows: Article 1: The Executive Yuan, to reorganize the political affairs of the northern provinces and cities, establishes the Executive Yuan's Political Affairs Reorganization Committee in Beiping. Article 2: The committee consists of 23 members, one of whom is designated as the chairman, selected by the President of the Executive Yuan and appointed by the National Government after approval by the Central Political Conference. Article 3: The chairman oversees the affairs of the committee. Article 4: The committee meets once a month, convened by the chairman. The rules of procedure are determined separately. The chairman may convene extraordinary meetings when necessary. Article 5: The committee establishes the following three departments: (1) Secretariat; (2) Political Affairs Department; (3) Finance Department. Article 6: The committee establishes one secretary-general to manage the affairs of the Secretariat, one director of political affairs to manage the affairs of the Political Affairs Department, and one director of finance to manage the affairs of the Finance Department. If necessary, each department may establish deputy directors. The detailed organizational rules are determined separately. Article 7: The committee may appoint councilors, advisors, and specialists as needed. Article 8: The committee may formulate separate regulations within the scope of not conflicting with central laws and regulations, submitting them to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. Article 9: The detailed rules of procedure for the committee are determined separately. Article 10: This provisional organizational outline takes effect from the date of promulgation. (6th)</p>

<p>Business Tax Levied on Lime and Brick Industry</p>
<p>The lime and brick kiln industry has historically operated with individual business permits and was therefore not subject to the general business tax. Now, the provincial government has promulgated special collection regulations for this industry, initially proposing a tax of 10% on net profits, later revised to 5%. Wu Xinren has been appointed as the Director of the Provincial Business Tax Bureau for this industry, dividing the province into eleven districts for separate collection. Songjiang, Fengxian, Jinshan, and Qingpu counties are grouped into one district, with a collection office established. An announcement was issued yesterday, requiring merchants in the industry to comply.</p>

<p>Xie Fengqi Dies Suddenly in Inn</p>
<p>Xie Fengqi, a 29-year-old man from Anhui residing on Hulong Street near Leqiao Doufen Garden, was formerly a revenue collector. This spring, he was introduced to the City Hotel by a friend to work as an external accountant, having deposited a cash pledge of 300 yuan. During the Dragon Boat Festival, the hotel suddenly dismissed Xie without fully returning his deposit, causing him to remain at the hotel, constantly distressed. On the evening of the 6th, he drank two catties of wine in room 15 and chatted happily with the waiter. Unexpectedly, he was found dead yesterday (7th) morning. The waiter, Rong Heshang, discovered Xie lying in a pool of blood with a deep and wide wound. He was rushed to Guangmin Hospital, but due to excessive blood loss, his life was in danger. The weapon used for the suicide, a large kitchen knife, was found under his pillow. Police officer Wang Xun and Xiang from the Second and Third Precincts have taken the case for record.</p>

<p>Crisis in the Revival of Sericulture</p>
<p>This year's spring silkworms were excellent, and farmers in the villages were overjoyed. The silk market also reached a peak, so farmers are mostly making plans for autumn planting. According to a recent survey, about two thousand sheets of silkworm eggs have been ordered near Yuqi Town, and less than half of the farmers have placed orders. It is expected that autumn planting sales will be three to four times higher than spring planting. Yesterday, the reporter visited Dong Shuzhen, director of the Dongcun Guidance Center, run by the county's agricultural farm. According to her, the amount of autumn silkworm eggs ordered by nearby farmers is several times greater than their own mulberry fields can support. Although this is a good sign that farmers are recovering from losses in silkworm production, there is concern that there will be too few mulberry leaves and too many silkworms, creating a great danger. Therefore, after investigating the amount of mulberry leaves available nearby, some restrictions should be imposed to avoid danger. It is hoped that the county agricultural farm and those concerned about the rural economy will pay attention to this.</p>

<p>Robbery of Nunnery and Rape of Nuns</p>
<p>Fushou Nunnery in Wang Village, south of Jinze in the county, has several nuns who accumulate savings through chanting scriptures and offering incense, making them a target for bandits. Around 7 PM the night before last, several bandits suddenly arrived, claiming to be there to request scripture chanting. They knocked on the door and entered, engaging in a large-scale robbery and forcibly raping nuns who were considered attractive. After the incident, it was discovered that seventy or eighty yuan had been stolen. The incident has been reported to the district regiment headquarters for investigation and arrest.</p>

<h3 id="e89">New Currency from the Mint to Circulate <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>American Chief Technician Mr. Grand to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow</p>
<p>Review Committee to Begin Testing New Currency</p>
<p>Since the Central Mint began minting new currency, it has already produced over two million pieces. Various sectors are hoping to see the currency circulate soon. It is learned that the second review committee will meet tomorrow and begin testing the new currency. Mr. Grand, the newly hired American chief technician, is also scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow. It is reported that he will plan to reorganize China's currency system. Details are reported below:</p>
<h3 id="e90">Second Review Committee to Meet Tomorrow <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>After the New Currency Review Committee was established last month, it held its first meeting, deciding on the testing methods and other procedures. It is learned that the committee is eager to put the newly minted currency into circulation as soon as possible. Therefore, the second committee meeting was originally scheduled for yesterday afternoon to conduct testing. However, due to many committee members having other important official duties, it was postponed to 4 PM tomorrow (9th) at the Central Bank's third floor. At that time, inspection and testing will begin. One or two coins will be selected from every ten thousand coins for testing. If they meet the prescribed standards, they will be approved for circulation nationwide.</p>
<h3 id="e91">American Chief Technician to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The Central Mint originally had a foreign chief technician named Li Weide, but he resigned and returned to his country due to old age. Finance Minister Song Ziwen specially hired Mr. Grand, a renowned American minting expert, to Shanghai to fill the position. Mr. Grand has served as the director of various mints in the United States and has extensive experience. He arrived in Shanghai on May 19th aboard the Dollar Steamship Lines' President Coolidge and is scheduled to arrive tomorrow. It is reported that Mr. Grand has a plan to reorganize China's currency system, which will be implemented by the financial authorities.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Minting Process is Quite Complex <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The silver used by the mint is melted down from large thousand-tael bars collected from various banks in Shanghai. First, it is tested and mixed with pure electrolytic copper, then melted into small hundred-yuan bars and rolled into thin sheets using a rolling machine. Then, they are stamped into round blanks, and finally, patterns are stamped using steel molds. Each time it goes through a machine, it must be baked and washed. Therefore, the minting of one silver dollar requires a very complex process. Finally, after being inspected by the review committee, it is circulated on the market. Currently, an average of 200,000 silver dollars can be produced per day. The composition is approximately 88% pure silver and 12% copper, melted together. The coins produced daily are sent to the Central Bank for storage in preparation for issuance.</p>

<p>Anti-Japanese Heroes Continue to Arrive</p>
<p>Zhang Dianjiu and Wang Delin</p>
<p>The anti-Japanese generals of the Northeast will return to China one after another in the near future. In addition to Ma Zhanshan, chairman of Heilongjiang Province, Xie Ke, chief of staff, and Su Bingwen, commander-in-chief of the Northeast People's Salvation Army, who arrived at the port on the evening of the 5th and went to Beijing the next day, others such as Wang Delin and Zhang Dianjiu will arrive in Shanghai one after another. The itineraries of the two men are recorded below:</p>
<p>Wang Delin, commander-in-chief of the anti-Japanese army in Jilin Province, followed Generals Ma Zhanshan and Su Bingwen into Russia. Later, his troops and the troops of Su Bingwen and Li Du jointly traveled to Xinjiang, while his family members arrived in Shanghai last month from Vladivostok on the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Wuyang wheel, and temporarily stayed in this port. Wang himself went from Russia to Italy, and last month took the German Messageries Maritimes' Salrerohen from Genoa, Italy, to China. He arrived in Hong Kong a few days ago and went to Guangzhou at the enthusiastic request of the Guangdong officials and people. According to sources in this port, Wang will stay in Guangzhou and will take a convenient ship to Shanghai soon.</p>
<p>Zhang Dianjiu, commander of the West Route of Su Bingwen's troops, arrived in China on the Salrerohen with Wang Delin. He did not stop in Hong Kong and continued to Shanghai on the original ship. He will arrive tomorrow (9th). Some of Su's subordinates will also come with Zhang Li.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Japanese Envoy Akira Ariyoshi Enters Beijing Yesterday <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Claims to Visit Various Authorities of the National Government</p>
<p>Does Not Involve Sino-Japanese Political Issues</p>
<p>Whether to Go to Beiping is Still Undecided</p>
<p>The Japanese Ambassador to China, Akira Ariyoshi, accompanied by his wife, Counselor and Mrs. Ariyoshi, Secretary Horiuchi, and Mrs. Okazaki, a total of six people, boarded a private car C502 and attached it to the express train departing from Shanghai to Beijing at 10 AM yesterday morning. Approximately 30 people, including Japanese Embassy Secretary Okazaki, Information Director Suma, and Japanese residents, went to the North Station to see them off. The Public Security Bureau of the Fifth District dispatched many armed police officers, together with the road police, to protect the station. The Municipal Government also sent Secretary Wang Changchun to see them off. According to Ariyoshi's statement to Japanese reporters before his departure, his trip to Beijing was to visit various authorities of the National Government and tour Nanjing. He would not engage in any negotiations on Sino-Japanese political issues. He planned to stay in Beijing for two or three days and then return to Shanghai. Whether to go to Beiping was still undecided. At the same time, Secretary Okazaki, who went to see him off, said that the ambassador's trip had no political relationship. A reporter from the New News Agency learned from reliable sources yesterday that Ariyoshi's sudden entry into Beijing was indeed due to a secret order from the Foreign Ministry of his country. His important task was to raise a request to our diplomatic authorities in a private capacity regarding the new tariffs promulgated by our country on May 12 and the anti-dumping taxes to be levied, as the Japanese side believed that after the customs announced the new tariffs, Japanese goods exported to China would be severely hit.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Ministry of Communications Borrows Boxer Indemnity Funds to Purchase New Telegraph Machines from England <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Sixteen Creed Machines and Four Printing Machines</p>
<p>To be Shipped Soon to Various Bureaus for Application</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications believes that most of the telegraph machines used by China's telegraph bureaus are Morse and Hughes, both of which are very fast, but the receiving procedure is cumbersome and slow. Therefore, European and American countries have recently abandoned them and use Creed high-speed telegraph machines. Due to economic reasons, China has not been able to replace them until now. In order to develop the business of various telegraph bureaus and strive for improvement, the ministry has borrowed £10,000 from the China Boxer Indemnity Board and a portion of the water conservancy project funds to purchase sixteen Creed machines and four Inker machines from England. The negotiations have been completed, and the machines will soon be shipped and assigned to telegraph bureaus in Nanjing, Shanghai, Hankou, Beiping, Qingdao, Yantai, and other places for application.</p>
<h3 id="e102">This City will Begin Collecting Land Value Tax <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Collection Scope Limited to the Chinese Area</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the collection of land value tax in this city has been in preparation since the municipal government submitted it to the central government for approval, and a preparatory committee for the collection of land value tax was established. It has been several months, but the Executive Yuan believes that the draft regulations for the collection of land value tax originally proposed by the municipal government still need to be amended, so the preparatory work of the committee has been suspended invisibly. It is learned that the regulations have been approved by the Executive Yuan meeting on the 6th. The reporter specifically asked Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, about this matter. According to him, the Executive Yuan's approval has not yet been received. As soon as the approval is received, preparations will continue, and it is planned to complete the preparatory work and begin collection in a few days. The collection scope is limited to the Chinese area and will be carried out district by district. The survey of the French Concession and other districts of Shanghai has been completed, so the Concession and other districts will start collection first.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Times reported that Finnish aviator Captain Bai Limai flew from Hong Kong to Shanghai yesterday morning (6th) at 5:40 AM. After stopping briefly in Xiamen at 10 AM to refuel, he continued his journey. He encountered headwinds along the way, so he could have arrived at the Hongqiao Airport at 3 PM in the afternoon, but he was delayed until 5:15 PM, flying 500 miles in seven and a half hours. When he departed from Hong Kong, he was thinly dressed. The temperature dropped sharply along the way, and he encountered strong winds, so he felt very cold. After landing and arranging his plane, he and Mr. Salimen, the Finnish acting consul-general in Shanghai who welcomed him at the scene, took a car to Mr. Sa's residence on Groisy Road in the French Concession. Captain Bai departed from Helsinki, the capital of Finland, on May 11th. He stayed in Berlin for 10 days, then passed through Hungary and Turkey to enter Persia, and then flew through India, Bangkok, and the estuary to Hong Kong. This trip is for pleasure and has the purpose of promoting Finland. Mr. Bai previously served in the Finnish Air Force. Last year, he flew alone from the Finnish capital to Cape Town, South Africa, and then flew back, becoming famous in the world. The Ta Mei Evening News reported that Captain Bai Limai is scheduled to fly to Qingdao tomorrow morning, and then take the road through Korea to Japan.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Associated Press President Kent Cooper Flew to Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The Ta Mei Evening News reports that there are two major news agencies in the United States, the Associated Press and the United Press. Kent Cooper, general manager of the United Press, passed through Shanghai yesterday (6th) and will still take the original round to Manila today. The President of the Scripps-Howard Newspaper Group and the Associated Press, Roy Howard, is expected to arrive in Shanghai from Beiping by plane this afternoon (7th). His son, Jack Howard, who used to edit news at the Ta Mei Evening News, is now the Associated Press representative in Manchuria and may come to Shanghai soon. Mr. Howard traveled from the United States, first visiting Japan, then Manchuria and Rehe, taking planes, cars, and trains to observe the current situation in the Japanese-occupied areas, then passing through the front lines of the two armies and arriving in Beiping, where he visited local officials and met old friends. After a short stay of a few days, he flew south again. Mr. Howard visited Shanghai twice in 1925 and 1929, this being his third visit. He has always been deeply concerned about Liaodong, especially the situation in China, so he wants to meet with more people in the region and understand the local situation. His secretary, Fost, arrived in Shanghai directly from Japan last week. However, since this is purely an informal private visit, the local authorities have not yet agreed on a welcome procedure. It is only heard that the Chinese newspapers will periodically host Mr. Howard to socialize and celebrate. After the Manchurian Incident, the Scripps-Howard Newspaper Group has often been able to speak justly for China in the American news industry, freely criticizing various Japanese aggression actions, and Howard has always advocated that for the benefit of the United States, instead of inserting itself into Far Eastern politics, it should concentrate on maintaining international peace institutions, tirelessly explaining his views.</p>

<p>Stating Organizational Goals</p>
<p>Requesting Guidance and Direction</p>
<p>The Shanghai Global Chinese Overseas General Association telegraphed the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission yesterday: "To the esteemed members of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Nanjing National Government, having previously submitted a report, we trust you have noted that the members of this association have always been determined to support the Party and the nation. The esteemed Commission is the highest government agency for managing overseas Chinese affairs, and this association dares not disrespect its support. Our letter of last October clearly expressed our sincere belief that the purpose of this association is to save ourselves and save the nation, while also assisting the government in handling overseas Chinese affairs and finding ways to alleviate the suffering of overseas Chinese. For example, in the recent anti-Chinese incident in Mexico, most overseas Chinese were forced to return home, penniless and displaced. Their plight is tragic. Food, clothing, and travel expenses are urgently needed. The government may be preoccupied with national difficulties and unable to attend to this matter in a timely manner. Therefore, this association, in the spirit of mutual assistance, has taken the initiative to raise funds for relief. This is intended as a temporary measure, and we dare not boast of our achievements. While directly preparing petitions for those who have been forced to return, we are also indirectly assisting the government in addressing the urgent needs. As for how to improve the organization of this association and how to achieve practical results in the future, we rely entirely on the guidance and direction of your esteemed Commission. We respectfully express our sincere hope that you will give this matter your attention. In anticipation of your instructions, we remain at your service. Wu Chengyu, Standing Committee Member, Provisional Executive Committee, Global Chinese Overseas General Association."</p>

<p>The Shanghai General Office of the World Red Swastika Society received a letter from the relief commissioner yesterday, reporting the tragic plight of disaster-stricken children. It is too painful to read. The original letter is transcribed below: "The two previous letters have hopefully reached you. Chairmen Li and Wang of the Dong and Ri Associations have both returned from relief efforts in the western region, remitting 10,000 yuan in relief funds, which has been received. It is planned to continue relief efforts in the Xiapifeng and Wugong counties in the western region, and to establish a disaster relief and care center in Liquan. Refugees in the province are 80% women and children, mostly from counties in the western region. They have lost their homes and their parents have died in ditches. Young children, barely weaned, wander the streets, each holding a small tin can, begging from door to door. On average, they cannot beg even ten copper coins a day. When hungry, they eat onion roots and sorghum stalks. When thirsty, they drink cold water like cattle. It is very difficult to get a bowl of noodle soup. At night, they sleep on the streets, exposed to the elements. It is feared that few will survive this hot summer. We hope that charitable organizations will come to Shaanxi as soon as possible to rescue these disaster-stricken children. The merit of this work cannot be compared to the relief of wounded soldiers.</p>

However, because the implementation methods had not yet been decided, and the framework and implementation methods are closely related, there was no further progress in the discussions the day before yesterday. However, both parties agreed. The Municipal Government and the Municipal Council are currently drafting implementation methods separately, which will be completed soon. Once the drafts are completed, another meeting will be scheduled for further discussion.</p>

<p>Minting New Currency: The new central currency has already begun to be minted, with a daily production of around 200,000 yuan. After being inspected and qualified, it will be put into circulation.

<p>Han Swastika Association Undertakes Relief Work in the North</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Office of the World Red Swastika Society received a telegram from the Beiping General Association yesterday stating that, although the war in North China has ceased, the disaster situation in the post-war areas is dire. Many houses have been burned to the ground, spring plowing has been missed, and refugees lack food and shelter. The future is unimaginable. In addition to establishing reception centers in Beiping, Tianjin, and Chahar to provide temporary shelter, the association is also planning relief efforts in the post-war areas. It has also instructed the previous relief teams to investigate and report nearby areas for future relief. Due to the vastness of the disaster area and insufficient relief personnel, the Hankou Swastika Branch was instructed to form a relief team to go north to carry out relief work. The Hankou branch replied by telegram: "To the esteemed chairmen of the Red Swastika Society, in accordance with the order to form a relief team for dispatch to provide relief, the 19th team has been formed after public discussion following the General Headquarters' organization. It is planned to depart north immediately. Wuhan Red Swastika Association."</p>

<h3 id="e127">The Attempt to Collect Fishing Industry Construction Fees <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Mediation Failed Yesterday</p>
<p>Government and Merchants Persist</p>
<p>Further Discussions This Afternoon</p>
<p>The Fishery Construction Fee Collection Office of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Area Fishery Improvement Committee of the Ministry of Industries, because it forced fish businesses to collect fees on its behalf, aroused dissatisfaction among the majority of members of the Fresh Fish Trade Association of this city, who unanimously denied responsibility for collecting the fees on behalf of the committee. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Yu Zhiqing, Du Yuesheng, Yu Zuoting, and Hu Diansun gathered fishery administration personnel and fish business managers at the 4th floor of the Ningbo Fellow Townsmen Association to discuss mediation. Because both sides persisted in their views, the mediation failed. The detailed situation is recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e128">Attendees <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The attendees included Yu Qiaqing, Du Yuesheng, Yu Zuoting, Hu Diansun, Fang Jiaobo, Zhang Shenzhi, Chen Zhongsheng, Zhou Jianyin, Director of the Fishery Administration Bureau, Lin Kanghou, Section Chief of the Fisheries and Animal Husbandry Department of the Ministry of Industries, and 22 fish business managers from this city, including Zhang Zhenfang and Liu Tonghua. Several hundred fishermen and fish business associates who came to Shanghai to sell fish, and Mao Anqing and Le Badong, representatives from the Dunshou Public Office of the Ningbo Fish Business, were also present. After 3:00 PM, both sides arrived and the mediation began.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Mediation Situation <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>First, Mr. Yu reported the reasons for convening the mediation meeting. Then, he asked each fish business manager for their opinions. Yu Zuoting and Hu Diansun, representing the fish business managers, stated the reasons for the difficulty of collecting construction fees on behalf of the fish businesses, saying that most transactions between fish businesses and fishermen are on credit. The fishermen are unwilling to pay the construction fee, and the fish businesses are not in a position to force them to pay. If the fish businesses were to force them to pay, the fishermen would be making the payment against their will, and the fish businesses' credit accounts would be difficult to collect. Naturally, the result would be that the fish businesses would be paying the construction fee on behalf of the fishermen. Zhou Jianyin then stated the reasons why the construction fee must be collected on behalf of the fish businesses, saying that the order for the fish businesses to collect the construction fee on behalf of the committee was set by the ministry. If the fish businesses were not responsible for collecting the fee on behalf of the committee, it would be equivalent to overturning the collection of the construction fee.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Proposal for Consideration <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Zhou also stated that if the fish businesses were not responsible for collecting the construction fee on behalf of the committee, the collection office would have no choice but to detain all goods for which the construction fee had not been paid in the future and enforce the collection. Each fish business manager stated that because of their own interests, they would rather close shop and cease operations than collect the construction fee on behalf of the committee, thus incurring the cost of the construction fee for no reason. At this point in the mediation, because both sides insisted on their views, it was considered hopeless. Mr. Yu stood up and said that this matter was of great importance and should be considered carefully. It was then decided that this afternoon would be the deadline for a final decision, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<p>Issuing Tax Exemption Certificates and Reduced Fare Shipping Orders</p>
<p>The Shanghai Domestic Products Manufacturers Association, intending to exhibit the products of various factories, requested the Ministry of Industries to issue tax exemption certificates and reduced freight vouchers. They consulted with the Ningbo County Domestic Products Exhibition on methods and the association telegraphed the Ministry of Industries for instructions. The Ministry issued a reply with the Industry Department Business Character No. 18047 stating: "Having received your telegram, this case was previously submitted to the Ministry by the Zhejiang Construction Department. Instructions have already been issued and the enclosed documents have been approved for record. Four copies of the tax exemption certificate and railway and shipping reduction vouchers are now issued. Please forward them to the Ningbo County Government for use in the exhibition and transport of domestic products. Enclosed are two copies of the certificate and freight voucher filling methods. Please forward them to be followed and reported. This order, etc.," which was printed and filed. The telegram was sent to inform.

<h3 id="e132">Reasons for Demanding the Cancellation of Awning Fees <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Thieler Agrees to Submit to the Board of Directors for Discussion</p>
<p>The Second Special District Citizens' Association previously sent several letters to the Municipal Council regarding the French Concession's collection of awning fees, requesting cancellation. However, the French Municipal Council has not responded. The association requested the Director of the Public Relations Department, Zhai Zhenhua, to go to the French Municipal Council to negotiate with Director Thieler and present two reasons: (1) Awnings are used for a very short time and do not obstruct pedestrians, so they should not be used to collect fees. (2) Although there was previously this fee, it was only 20 cents per quarter. This time, the fees are as high as 4 to 5 yuan. In this time of economic depression, merchants and citizens cannot afford to pay. Director Thieler accepted the above two points and agreed to submit them to the Board of Directors for discussion and to develop a sound solution.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Shanghai Disaster Area Fire Insurance Claims Association <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Petitioning Central Authorities to Negotiate Compensation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Disaster Area Fire Insurance Claims Association was initially established because policyholders used their money to benefit the insurance companies, but once an accident occurred, the companies tried to evade responsibility. Therefore, the Fire Insurance Association was formed, and the Claims Association was created. Since its establishment, there has been considerable progress. Recently, because the Coordination Association has shown signs of stagnation, and policyholders are dissatisfied and rumors are rampant, Wang Zhixiang, Mou Yueqiu, and other core members of the Claims Association convened an emergency meeting yesterday. On the one hand, they asked the persons in charge of the Coordination Association about the status of the negotiations, requesting a reply. On the other hand, they sent separate petitions to the central authorities to negotiate compensation to help the disaster victims. The atmosphere at the meeting was tense. Wang Zhixiang then proposed that the final effective method of claim be made within the scope that does not harm the public security and order of the Chinese Concession, so as to achieve the goal of compensation.</p>

<p>Guowen News Agency reports: The Maigen Road station has always been the hub for loading and unloading freight trains on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways in Shanghai. The station's transportation workers, totaling 669, jointly organized a cooperative to undertake this loading and unloading work. They paid a deposit of 6,900 yuan when they initially took over the work. For years, everything has been fine. At 6:00 AM yesterday, Mo Heng, Director of General Affairs of the two railways, and Zheng Baozhao, Director of Vehicle Affairs, along with more than 30 security guards, arrived at the Maigen Road station and ordered the workers to hand over the loading and unloading work to the contractor Yang Hengzhen. The workers protested loudly and refused to comply. As of the afternoon, the situation was still at a stalemate.</p>

<p>Workers Petition the Social Affairs Bureau</p>
<p>Stating the Capitalist Side Violates Labor Union Law</p>
<p>The dispute over the dismissal of workers at the Nanyang Tobacco Factory in this city has been dragging on for months without resolution. It has now been submitted for arbitration. However, Jian Yujie, the general manager of the company, hastily established the Nanyang Office, considering it an illegal organization. He petitioned the Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau to suppress it. On June 1st, the Municipal Government ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to instruct the Nanyang Office to reorganize. The office has been established for nearly three months and has never engaged in illegal activities. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the Fourth District Cigarette Industry Labor Union sent representatives Wu Shiyuan, Zhang Zhang, Hu Duilin, Wang Jiansheng, and others to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition, requesting early arbitration and a thorough investigation to clarify the truth. Zhang Chuqiang from the Third Section received them and promised to submit the petition for review and decision. According to union representative Wu Shiyuan, in addition to submitting a point-by-point refutation of the capitalist side's claims, the union believes that the capitalist side has violated Articles 31, 32, and 33, as well as Articles 48 and 49 of the Labor Union Law, and should be subject to appropriate punishment. The union plans to petition the Municipal Government tomorrow to clarify the truth.</p>

<p>The Corpse Was Collected by the Shop Owner</p>
<p>Various Groups Meeting to Discuss Solutions</p>
<p>The tragic case of the barber's apprentice Gao Yatou occurred a month ago, and a solution has yet to be found. Various groups are still continuing to negotiate the matter. Gao Yatou's body is being stored at the Tongren Fuyuan Hall awaiting re-examination. Recently, the court rejected the re-examination procedure, so it cannot be stored in the hall for long. Shop owner Hu Shunyuan has spent over two hundred yuan to prepare a coffin for its collection. The corpse is stored in the Tongren Fuyuan Hall cemetery in Pudong. If re-examination is possible, it can be retrieved. Gao Yatou's father, Gao Yuanlin, is currently being supported by the Barber's Guild and resides within the guild, awaiting the resolution of the case. However, according to letters from his hometown, the entire family relies on Gao Yatou for their livelihood. The case is delayed, and the family in the village hopes that Gao's father will return home as soon as possible because spring planting is imminent, making further delays difficult. It is reported that the French authorities are using the excuse that Gao died of illness and have not shown any intention to provide relief or maintain a proper aftermath. Therefore, the Yangzhou Fellow-Villagers Association, the Yangzhou Public Office, the Barber's Guild, the Gao Yatou Case Committee of the Barbering Industry, the French Concession Hawker's Association, and other groups involved in assisting with the negotiation of this case are actively continuing negotiations. It is reported that the Gao Yatou Case Committee of the Barbering Industry has scheduled its ninth executive committee meeting for 10:00 AM (today) at the Barber's Guild in Nan Shi Xiejiao to discuss the final countermeasures.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Former New World Tea Server Extorts Money from Inspector <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Shen Guanghua (also known as Gangzi), a Jiangbei native residing at No. 4664 Robert's Road in West Shanghai, used to work as a tea server at the New World Amusement Park. He often disagreed with Wang Songfu, an inspector from Nanjing at the park. During the Lunar New Year this year, New World reopened, but Shen's business was suddenly terminated. Suspecting that Wang had instigated this, his resentment deepened, and he thought of revenge. On the Dragon Boat Festival, Shen invited four accomplices to ambush Wang Songfu at the intersection of Jiujiang Road and Xizang Road. They swarmed forward, blocked his path, and assaulted him with fists and feet. As a result, Wang suffered minor injuries, and his clothes were torn. Shen and the others scattered and fled. However, Wang initially intended to pursue the matter, but Shen's relative, Dong Shuangquan, who served as a headman in the fire brigade, repeatedly mediated with Wang, and the matter was dropped. Unexpectedly, Shen was still unwilling to let it go. At 10:30 AM the day before yesterday, he wrote a threatening letter and mailed it to Wang. The letter contained strong language, recounting the facts of his termination and demanding that Wang compensate him for the loss of his job. He gave Wang two days to reply. If he did not comply, he would take further action. After receiving the letter, Wang reported it to the Xinzha police station, which dispatched detectives Ye Yushan and Dong Shuangquan to investigate Shen's whereabouts. Shen Guanghua was found at the rooftop garden of the New New Company. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian explained the case, stating that according to Article 319 of the Criminal Law on obstructing freedom, the defendant Shen Guanghua was being prosecuted. Wang Songfu, the plaintiff, also testified to the previous events. When questioned, the defendant's testimony was evasive. After a court-appointed public defender and the police lawyer presented their arguments, Judge Liu Yugui reviewed the evidence and announced that the debate in the case was concluded and that the verdict would be announced on Friday of this week.</p>

<p>丨Accuses Madame of Obstructing Freedom丨</p>
<p>Lin Yaqin, also known as A Si, a woman from Haimen, is currently twenty-three years old. When she was twelve, her hometown was devastated by floods, and Lin's entire family was scattered without a trace. Alone and lonely, she encountered kidnappers who lured her to Shanghai and sold her to Madame Yang Ajin. Yang opened a brothel in Fuxiang Lane. Seeing that Lin was beautiful, she instructed her to learn to sing and play musical instruments, preparing her to solicit customers in the future. At the age of fourteen, Lin's training was complete, and Yang forced her into prostitution, changing her name to Wang Baobao. From then on, she was busy with soliciting customers and had no free time. If she slightly disobeyed, she would be frequently beaten and suffered greatly. In 1931, Yang moved her business to Fuyu Lane, renaming herself Xia Jun. Later, because the prostitution business was poor, Yang sold Lin to Feng Deming as a concubine for 1,200 yuan. Lin thought that she could finally regain her freedom and escape the fire pit. Unexpectedly, fate was fickle. Feng was deeply addicted to gambling and had no profession, so he was unable to maintain a living. Feng and Yang Ajin agreed to redeem Lin for 205 yuan. In the spring of this year, she was transferred to Yaqin Brothel in Fuyu Lane as a prostitute for 150 yuan. Before long, the business declined, and Yaqin Brothel closed. Yang then changed her approach and forced Lin to solicit customers at various amusement parks, a practice commonly known as "tangbai." From then on, she engaged in the flesh trade, and her suffering deepened. Over the years, the income from her nightly fees was considerable, and all the clothes and jewelry given by customers were taken and stored by Yang. Lin received not a penny. Resentful, she often thought of escaping the cage and escaping the sea of suffering, but Yang was very vigilant, and there was no opportunity. It wasn't until last month that she finally seized an opportunity to escape. She went to Lawyer Xiong Fei for help, requesting him to find a way to break her relationship with Yang, restore her personal freedom, and return the clothes and jewelry given by customers. Lawyer Xiong immediately sent a letter to Yang questioning her. Unexpectedly, Yang not only refused to return them but also claimed that Lin owed more than a thousand yuan in debt and could only be free after the debt was cleared. Lin had no choice but to ask Lawyer Xiong to file a complaint with the First Special District Court, accusing Yang Ajin of obstructing her freedom and attaching a civil suit, requesting a judgment to return the clothes and jewelry worth 553 yuan. The court approved the request and ordered a summons for yesterday afternoon. Judge Qian Wenji presided over the joint interrogation in the Second Criminal Court. Because the address of Yang written in the original complaint was 837 Fuhua Lane, Pike Road, she could not be found. Therefore, the defendant did not appear. Judge Qian briefly questioned Lin Yaqin and ordered the case to be rescheduled, pending the arrival of the defendant for further questioning.</p>

<p>Taking Care Earnestly in the Name of Fellow Villager</p>
<p>A Look Back and the Wicker Trunk Was Gone</p>
<p>Wu Xiao, a forty-year-old woman from Anhui province, came to Shanghai for business and stayed at the Fuxin Hotel in the French Concession. She became acquainted with a young man who lived nearby. The young man claimed to be a fellow villager of Xiao, so they became even closer. The day before yesterday evening, Xiao purchased some cloth and several items of her own clothing, which she stored in a wicker trunk, preparing to take a boat back home. The young man learned of this and volunteered to carry the trunk and accompany her to board the ship, fulfilling the obligation of a fellow villager. When they reached the gangway of the Shun Ferry at the Jinliyuan Wharf of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Xiao turned around and saw that the young man had disappeared. Xiao was anxious because the cash and clothing in the trunk were worth about a hundred yuan. She immediately returned to the original hotel to inquire about his whereabouts. After a while, the young man did return, but he had changed into a new silk long gown, a new straw hat, and new maoge shoes, looking completely different from before. The wicker trunk was gone. Xiao immediately grabbed him and called the police, who took him to the police station. Since the case occurred on the water, the Maritime Customs Police Station was notified, and Detective Shen Changshan brought the plaintiff and defendant back for questioning. According to the defendant, who identified himself as Chen Zhenghuan, a twenty-five-year-old man from Anhui, the clothing and other items in the plaintiff's wicker trunk had all been pawned off to buy clothes for his use. He still had ten yuan left. The police chief immediately ordered him to be sent to court for trial.</p>

<p>Refrigerating the Corpse with a Large Block of Ice</p>
<p>Police Station Investigates Relevant Persons Based on Reports</p>
<p>At 6:00 PM the day before yesterday, an apprentice fight occurred on Gonghe Road in Zhabei, leading to a death and concealment of the body, attempting to destroy the case. The Fourth District Public Security Bureau and the Detective Team discovered this yesterday afternoon. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e142">Gonghe Road Giant Store <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The Gonghechun Wine and Noodle Restaurant is located at No. 53 Gonghe Road in Zhabei. It is a double-fronted store that has been in business for several years and has a very good business, making it a giant store on Gonghe Road. The owner is a Mr. Xu from Wuxi, who passed away several years ago. All store affairs are now managed by his son, Xu Fengqi. Most of the shop assistants are also hired from Wuxi, including two apprentices: one named San Nv, nineteen years old, with an unknown surname, and one named Han Xi Nv, seventeen years old, also from Wuxi. They specialize in delivering noodles at the restaurant.</p>
<h3 id="e143">A Punch to the Temple <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Around 5:00 PM the day before yesterday (the 6th), the two apprentices suddenly started arguing, and the dispute escalated to a physical fight. They exchanged punches and kicks. However, Han Ding Nv was slightly younger and not as strong as San Nv. He was punched in the temple by San Nv, and Xi Nv immediately fell to the ground. San Nv attempted to add to the assault, but fortunately, the other shop assistants intervened and stopped San Nv. They told Xi Nv to get up on his own. However, Xi Nv's face was pale, and his breathing was weak. They thought he had been hit in the chest and was unable to breathe, or that he was dizzy from the blow. They quickly helped him up, carried him upstairs, and laid him on the bed, covering him with blankets to let him rest.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Sleeping Never to Wake <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>After a while, the other shop assistants became worried because Xi Nv had been sleeping silently for a long time. They asked San Nv to go upstairs with them to check on him. They saw that Xi Nv's face had turned gray and he had no breath. They felt him and he was ice-cold. He had been dead for a long time. The shop assistants were shocked and immediately reported to the young owner, Xu Fengqi. Upon hearing the news, Xu was terrified because the matter involved a death. He quickly discussed solutions with the other assistants. At the same time, Xu was afraid of being implicated himself, so he secretly instructed the other assistants to keep the matter a secret. He then secretly purchased a large amount of ice and refrigerated Xi Nv's body with ice in order to find another way to deal with it.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Police Station Investigation <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Unexpectedly, the matter was not kept secret and was heard by neighbors. At 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon, they secretly reported it to the Fourth District Headquarters. District Chief Lai received the report and immediately dispatched Detective Foremen Wang Shifu and Geng Shoubao, Detectives Miao Jinhai, Fang Chaozu, Wang Songlin, Zhao Huai'ren, and Xu Jingen, and Patrol Officer Mu Chengjin, leading officers to investigate the truth at the restaurant. They indeed discovered a corpse. There was a bruise on the temple of the head. They questioned each shop assistant individually and learned the above details. They immediately arrested San Nv and brought the young owner and the old boss's wife to the headquarters for detention. They also instructed the local bailiff to guard the corpse at the noodle restaurant and reported it to the court for inspection today. After the discovery of this matter, those who came to watch the scene were extremely crowded. When the trial opens in the future, it will likely cause a sensation among tens of thousands of people.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Large-Scale Raid on Opium Dens in the French Concession <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Over One Hundred Opium Pipes</p>
<p>Two Hundred Opium Addicts, Male and Female</p>
<p>Recently, opium pills have become prevalent in the market. Due to the high price of raw opium, most people in the underworld have switched to opium pills. As a result, those addicted to opium pills account for eight out of ten, while those who smoke opium only account for two out of ten. Currently, the two most popular types of opium pills are the "Eleventh Hour" and "Taixing" brands. Opium pill dens (commonly known as "zizi ke") are most numerous on Zilaihuo Street in the French Concession, in Ruifu Lane. The French Chief Inspector learned of this and immediately dispatched a large number of French, Vietnamese, and Chinese detectives and police officers, totaling several hundred, to surround Ruifu Lane yesterday (the 7th) at around 10:00 AM. The Western Detective Chief personally led the Chinese and Western detectives to search house by house. After three hours, they seized three opium pipes, over one hundred opium pill pipes, and countless opium lamps and smoking paraphernalia. They arrested over two hundred people, including den owners and opium addicts, male and female (because the fingers of those who smoke opium pills inevitably turn yellow, the fingers of those arrested were inspected and there was no way to hide it). They filled seven trucks and sent them in batches to the Dazimingzhong Police Station for separate detention and investigation. Since this large-scale raid, the scourge of opium pills in the French Concession may be somewhat curbed.</p>

<p>Japanese Newspaper Elated</p>
<p>Praising Shanghai People's Drinking Capacity</p>
<p>Alas, Chinese Drinkers!</p>
<p>The Japanese Shanghai Daily News stated that in the past ten days, 8,000 cases of beer have been imported from Japan. This includes 6,000 cases imported by the Asosan Maru on the 28th of last month, 1,778 cases imported by the Nagasaki Maru at the beginning of this month, and 300 cases imported by the Mikasa Maru. The Ikoma Maru and Asosan Maru, which are expected to arrive soon, carry approximately several thousand cases. This is truly a unique phenomenon of beer flooding the market. This shows the large drinking capacity of Shanghai people. It is found that the imported products are mainly those produced by Dai-Nippon Brewery and Sakura Beer. In addition to imports from the mainland, the quantity imported from Qingdao is even larger.</p>

<p>Approved by the Municipal Council</p>
<p>Recently, due to the continuous drop in the exchange rate, the Public Concession Tram Company petitioned the Municipal Council to allow it to increase fares appropriately. The Municipal Council approved the request. The newly determined prices are approximately 4-5% higher for first class and approximately 5% higher for second class (the old prices were revised in April 1931). This is still far from the maximum price allowed by the regulations, and the increase per stop is generally only one copper coin.</p>

<p>Sudden Attack While Sound Asleep</p>
<p>The Yin Lianzi Couple Severely Injured</p>
<p>Yin Lianzi, from Yancheng, is thirty years old. He is married to Zhang, who is twenty-four years old, also from Yancheng. Yin works as a teahouse attendant in the Jiangbei Theater on Xiaoshadu Road. Their home is at No. 5 Fuyuan Lane, Xiaoshadu Road. At around 3:10 AM yesterday morning, while the Yin couple was sound asleep, several thugs broke open the back door of the house and rushed directly to Yin's bedroom upstairs. They took out sharp blades and slashed wildly at Yin and Zhang. The two were wounded and were awakened from their dreams, screaming for help. The thugs were caught and quickly went downstairs to escape. Neighbors arrived to find the couple lying in a pool of blood. They immediately reported to the Gordon Road Police Station, which dispatched patrol officer No. 2451 to the scene. The two injured people were transported to Renji Hospital for treatment. Yin was the most seriously injured, with about six or seven cuts to the head and two cuts to both feet. Yin's wife, Zhang, only had one cut to the head. The identity of the perpetrators is unknown because it was dark. However, according to Zhang, someone had previously asked Yin for money unsuccessfully, and this may have been an act of revenge. The Gordon Road Police Station is still investigating.</p>

<p>Ye Ziheng Donates Entire Garden Property to Medical School</p>
<p>Departments for Tuberculosis, Nervous Disorders, and General Cases Established</p>
<p>Officially Admits Patients Starting on the 15th of This Month</p>
<p>The city is a mix of Chinese and foreigners, with a large and prosperous population. In terms of disease treatment, in addition to public and private hospitals, there is a lack of large-scale sanatoriums, which is a deficiency in the medical field. The Ye Family Garden in Jiangwan covers more than eighty acres, with elegant gardens and lush trees. It is open to the public for sightseeing and is highly praised by the citizens. The garden's owner, Mr. Ye Ziheng, is enthusiastic about education and concerned about infectious diseases. Recently, he donated his entire garden property to the National Shanghai Hospital. The National Government and the Ministry of Education have successively praised him for this. After several discussions between the college president, Yan Fuqing, and Mr. Ye, the transfer procedures have been completed. It has been decided that the garden will be the Second Teaching Hospital of the National Shanghai Medical College, with three departments: a tuberculosis sanatorium, a nervous disorder sanatorium, and a general sanatorium. It will be the most complete sanatorium in Shanghai. It will also utilize the inherent scenery as a place for patients to rest and recuperate. Its effectiveness is far above that of medicine, making it the most needed sanatorium in the city. Currently, the internal construction has been completed in order. It has been decided that from the 15th of this month, various types of tuberculosis patients will be admitted first.</p>

<p>丨Ding and Yu Each Fined 20 Yuan丨</p>
<p>Ding Zhiyi and Yu Jun, secret agents from the Supervisory Office of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, learned that Tian Fuyuan, a worker at the Public Concession Telephone Company, was nominally registered as a communist and persuaded him to surrender. They scheduled a negotiation at a tea room near the Continental Marketplace on Jiujiang Road. When Ding and Yu went to fulfill the appointment, a conflict suddenly arose. Tian accused Ding and Yu of instigating him to incite his colleagues to strike, but because he refused, Ding and others tried to kidnap him. He called the police, who arrested them and took them to the police station. The next day, they were transferred to the First Special District Court for trial. The two sides attacked each other. Tian said that Ding and Yu instigated the strike, while Ding and Yu said that Tian was a communist. The judge ordered the original defendant and defendant to post bail separately and await further investigation. After a detailed investigation by the Chinese and Western detectives handling the case, it was confirmed that Ding Zhiyi and Yu Jun interfered with Tian Fuyuan's freedom of movement. Regardless of whether they had orders from superiors, they had crossed the border to make an arrest. Such illegal actions cannot be tolerated. Yesterday morning, the two defendants, Ding and Yu, were brought to the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Ru Bao'yi explained the police's findings, and Tian Fuyuan also came to court to explain the situation at the time. Ding and Yu insisted on their previous statements. After hearing the case, Judge Qian Hongye found that the defendants' statements were unsubstantiated and unreliable. He immediately pronounced the verdict, fining Ding and Yu 20 yuan each as a warning.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Customs Notice Redefines Navigation Jargon for Vessels <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>China Merchants Bureau Orders All Ship Captains to Comply</p>
<p>Collision or Violation Will Result in Fines</p>
<p>The Jianghai Customs, based on the International Maritime Conference, has redefined the navigation jargon for vessels and issued a notice to the China Merchants Bureau, ordering ship captains to comply. The notice states: "For compliance, according to the Customs Notice, the driving jargon has been redefined in accordance with the International Maritime Conference. From now on, all Logbooks and regular jargon must use RightLeft, and portStarboard must not be used. In the future, if a collision occurs due to violations, the violating party will inevitably lose the lawsuit. Therefore, the responsibility of the driver is very important and must be paid special attention to. The explanation of the new jargon is as follows: (A) If the ship's bow is to be turned to the left, everything is left. 1. The command is in English, the captain's command is Left. 2. The helmsman replies Left, the rudder wheel Wheel is turned to the left. 3. The pointer Pointer moves to the left. 4. The rudder Rudder moves to the left. 5. The ship's bow moves to the left. (B) If the ship's bow is to be turned to the right, everything is right. 1. The command is in English, the captain's command is Right. 2. The helmsman replies Right, the rudder wheel Wheel is turned to the right. 3. The pointer Pointer moves to the right. 4. The rudder Rudder moves to the right. 5. The ship's bow moves to the right. This order urgently notifies all ship captains to comply and to instruct the drivers to comply as a whole. This is very important. Do not make any mistakes."</p>

<p>Water Police Second Division Ordered to Patrol</p>
<p>Dinghai Li Port is surrounded by the sea, and most residents rely on fishing for a living. From Qingming Festival to the end of Great Heat, it is called the "Ocean Life Season," and fishermen are divided into two groups: one group catches yellow croaker, and the other catches pomfret. This year's fishing season is very prosperous. Fishermen Bei Xiyuan and Sun Aji, who belonged to the pomfret group, caught thousands of catties of pomfret and planned to transport it to Ningbo for sale. However, when they reached the waters of Dinghai, they were robbed. The people and the boat were taken to Taizhou, and they were only released after a huge ransom was paid. The remaining pomfret had already been auctioned off by the bandits. There are 130 yellow croaker boats and 53 pomfret boats in the port. Upon hearing this news, everyone felt insecure. The fishermen sent Wang Asheng to the Second Marine Police Brigade to petition. After receiving the report, the brigade dispatched the Second Division to patrol the area, ordering the arrest of the escaped bandits within a limited time.</p>

Suspecting their behavior, they quickly pursued them. One officer grabbed one of the men from behind and began a search. Unexpectedly, the other man seized the opportunity, while the officers were unprepared, and pulled out a pistol, firing a shot at officer No. 2528, hitting him in the left wrist. The officer fell to the ground. Officer No. 3314, seeing this, bravely stepped forward to arrest the man, but the gunman fired twice at officer No. 3314, hitting him in the left wrist, causing him to fall to the ground as well. The two rioters then calmly escaped. Nearby officers, hearing the alarm, rushed to the scene to give chase, but to no avail. The injured officers were taken to Huade Road Hospital for treatment.

<p>Yesterday morning around 6:00 AM, a man with a bullet wound sought medical treatment at Baolong Hospital on Route Bo ক্লerk. He claimed to be Wang Youren, 39 years old, from Nanjing, residing at No. 17 at the intersection of Route Beller in the French Concession. He said he had a mistress named Sister Guan, 31 years old, living in a flat in the Bansongyuan Road area of Gaochang Temple in Nanshi. Yesterday morning, he went to Sister Guan's place for a tryst, when her husband suddenly appeared and shot at him, hitting him in the left chest and exiting through his back.

<p>Mao Jichang, a 27-year-old from Ningbo, worked at the duck slaughterhouse operated by Weng Qiyin at No. 88 Huiguan Street, Dongjiadu, Nanshi. A few days ago, he and his fellow villagers, nicknamed Da Lai and Hemp Skin, gathered to play mahjong. At that time, Mao owed Da Lai Hemp Skin three yuan in gambling debts. Mao had already paid back five jiao, still owing two yuan and five jiao. Da Lai Hemp Skin repeatedly demanded payment without success. Yesterday afternoon around 4:00 PM, Da Lai went to the duck slaughterhouse again to demand the outstanding debt, but still received no payment. Da Lai became increasingly angry and argued with Mao, which soon escalated into a conflict. In a fit of rage, Da Lai punched Mao hard in the waist. Unexpectedly, the blow hit a vital spot, and Mao fell to the ground, unmoving. Realizing he had caused a major disaster, Da Lai immediately fled. Mao's colleagues, Ye Aliang and others, heard the noise and rushed out, only to find Mao lying in the courtyard, pale-faced, breathing rapidly, and bleeding from all seven orifices. Knowing he was seriously injured, they quickly took him to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. However, due to the severity of the injury, he died before receiving treatment. They reported the situation to Yi, the chief of the first precinct's first station. Upon receiving the report, Yi, recognizing that this was a matter of life and death, ordered his subordinates to pursue the murderer and instructed Qin Defang, the local chief of the 23rd police division, to report the incident to the local court for an autopsy.</p>

<p>Wen Hong'en, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, previously discovered that lotteries were rampant in Nanshi and Zhabei, and their popularity was due to the strict prohibition by the French Concession authorities, leading them to secretly operate in the Chinese area under the guise of literary societies and poetry riddles. In reality, they were disguised lotteries, and these hooligans even brazenly claimed that certain government agencies had provided financial support. This bold and reckless behavior was intolerable. He issued a sincere proclamation, strictly prohibiting them, and ordered all district stations and teams to arrest them, with the goal of eradicating them completely. As a result, the number of cases cracked by various district stations has been increasing daily. However, to avoid arrest, the lottery organizers have devised various ingenious methods, such as collecting lottery gambling funds in latrines or urinals, or using newspaper vendors' bags to collect them in alleys. The methods are ever-changing, making arrests difficult. Yesterday, Shen Zhenhua, chief of the Second District's First Sub-Station, learned that the rascal Feng Bojin and Wang Weigen had established a large lottery operation at No. 9, Shi Cheng Lane. He dispatched Inspector Luo to lead police officers to make the arrest, capturing Feng and Wang and seizing gambling funds of seven yuan, 70 cents in corner tickets, fifteen double-corner coins, ninety lottery books, three small stamps, and eight hundred copper coins. They were all taken to the station. Additionally, Inspector Zhang Zeqian of Shipin Lane led police officers to investigate and arrest Zhao Asi, a lottery operator, in Daoxing Lane, seizing a bundle of lottery paper. Furthermore, Officer Qi led police officers to investigate and discover a lottery operation on the upper floor of the Tiger Stove in Monk Hong's residence, seizing thirty-one sheets of lottery paper. After interrogation, they were all sent to the General Bureau for legal action.</p>

<p>Despite the Tanggu Truce, the Japanese army is still moving troops into Chahar. The area is located on the automobile road from Zhangjiakou north to Outer Mongolia's Kulun, a vital trade route between China and Russia. Furthermore, the three provinces of Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan are all located outside the Great Wall, in what was formerly Inner Mongolia. The Japanese covet Manchuria and Mongolia. Although they have temporarily acquired our four northeastern provinces, their ambition to gain an inch and then a foot is still focused on Chahar and Suiyuan. The Japanese-Chinese Co-operative Geoscience Society at No. 19 Baolong Fang, Albert Road, this city, has recently published a complete map of the three provinces of Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan, compiled by Su Jiarong. It is bilingual in Chinese and English, and very detailed. Those concerned about national defense should pay attention to it.

<p>| His Wife Petitions for Divorce |</p>
<p>Yang Zhu, a 31-year-old woman from Zhoupu, married Yang Chengxin, from the same village, in 1919. Chengxin is an alcoholic and violent, often beating his wife after drinking. In recent years, he has become involved with a loose woman and started a small family in Shanghai, living together like husband and wife, abandoning his wife and cutting off all daily living expenses. He has also sold off the ancestral farmland to pay for his expenses, leaving Yang Zhu and her two young children without food or clothing. Recently, Yang Zhu found out in Shanghai that Yang Chengxin was renting a house with his mistress at No. 61 Zhanqi Fang, Beizhangjia Street, Sanpailou, in the city. One morning, she went there and found Yang Chengxin and a woman sleeping together in the nude. She immediately called the police, who arrested them and took them to the Second Sub-Station of the First District, before transferring them to the Public Security Bureau, where they were detained for three days and then released on bail. Currently, Yang Zhu has hired lawyers Wu Luping and Zhang Juansheng to petition the local court for a divorce. Yesterday, the court summoned them for mediation, but the defendant did not appear. The judge concluded that the defendant Yang Chengxin had no sincere intention to mediate, and his malicious abandonment of his wife was undeniable. The court has ordered the plaintiff to formally file for divorce.</p>

<p>| Robbers Still Denying Theft from Travelers |</p>
<p>Shang Wu, a Chinese detective from the Dickson Road Police Station, arrested Zhang Cheng, a robber from Guangdong, along with his wife, Ms. Li, around 10:00 PM the night before, on North Zhejiang Road. He learned that they had two pistols hidden in Room No. 1 of the Changxing Hotel at No. 40 Chenjia Mubiao, Songshan Road, in the French Concession. He collaborated with detectives from the relevant police station and rushed to the hotel, where they found a Brown Bess pistol, an automatic pistol, fourteen bullets, and a leather wallet containing twelve pawn tickets behind the bed in the room. They were all taken back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Local Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that the defendant was found to be related to the robbery of property from a certain family at No. 27 Tiantong Road on January 15 of this year. However, the defendant denied the robbery at the police station and requested a postponement for further investigation. He then presented the guns and ammunition for inspection. The defendant claimed that the hotel room was opened by a fugitive named Lu, and that the guns, ammunition, and wallet were also owned by Lu. Ms. Zhang Li's testimony was the same as Zhang Cheng's. The police lawyer then stated that the hotel room was indeed opened by the defendant, and the account books could be used as evidence in the next hearing. Judge Xiao Fen verified the testimony and ordered them to be remanded in custody for further investigation.</p>

<p>More than ten natives of Haining in Shanghai, including Chen Jitang, Cha Zhongjian, Feng Liutang, Zhu Yucang, and Cha Xianbo, are currently gathering former teachers and staff of various schools in their county who are now in Shanghai for a reunion. They issued a notice yesterday, which stated: "Poetry and songs are used to make friends. Do not doubt the sentence 'Why not wear a hairpin together?' The ancients were so sincere to their friends. How much more so to those who have tasted the bitterness of teaching together? Some of us have left our hometowns, while others have become earthworms in Shanghai. In the past, we sought each other out. Today, we are separated. It is difficult to meet face to face, and it is not easy to shake hands after many years. We will not seek the bond of a 'moss and fern' covenant, but rather the alliance of a 'cart and umbrella.' We are gathering our colleagues to initiate this event, planning to drink and talk together every season, hoping to meet and reminisce about the past." It is reported that many people have already joined.</p>

<p>Pudong Bank in this city previously purchased champagne tickets from Henan, Anhui, Hubei, and Sichuan provinces to donate to depositors for charitable purposes, which was well received by all sectors. As the champagne has already been drawn, many depositors have written to request that aviation construction lottery tickets be continued to be donated. The bank believes that aviation construction is also an important national policy, and therefore, at its own expense, it is continuing to donate them. Anyone who deposits 2,000 yuan in the bank's savings department for a term of one year will receive an aviation construction lottery ticket in addition to the regular interest. As a special preferential measure, if there are already deposits in the bank's savings department, a combination of 2,000 yuan will also be eligible for donation. Depositors can gain fixed interest and also great hope. This is a win-win situation. The bank is also acting as an agent for the sale of these lottery tickets at ten yuan each.</p>

<p>Sir, I was deeply shocked to see an interview with me in today's newspaper. As I am swamped with official duties, I do not ask or concern myself with external affairs, and have expressed no opinion on the same. The passage of conversation to which you refer is in no way based on fact, and I request that this letter be published in your column for clarification. Yours truly, Hu Yunlai, 22.6.7</p>
<p>(Note: Yesterday's news was taken from the Huadong News Agency. We hereby declare.)</p>
<p>To the esteemed Editor, I was shocked and baffled to see an article in your newspaper on the 4th of this month concerning a lawsuit between myself and Mr. Ding. Many of the claims made in the article were false, as follows: I am employed only as a cosmetics broker and am not simultaneously teaching at the Minli Middle School, point 1. Furthermore, to say that I was "infatuated with Yang Lanchun" is untrue. I make only a small profit selling cosmetics and can barely make ends meet in expensive Shanghai; there is no time for me to "spend time with courtesans," let alone "infatuation," point 2. If I occasionally attend social gatherings to entertain clients, that does not mean that I am "infatuated" - Mr. Ding's misleading claims are an attempt to unjustly smear my name so that he can gain an advantage in court. I hope you will print a correction and avoid aiding Mr. Ding in this deception. Sincerely, Yang Ziqin, June 7</p>

<p>丨Letter from Ban Yu from Nanyang Sand and Sarawak丨</p>
<p>Advisor,</p>
<p>Most of the overseas Chinese here were forced to come because of extortion by local bullies and gentry in the motherland, accounting for about 40-50%. Among those who earned money and returned home, 20-30% still suffered exploitation. Because of this, I am in a dilemma. I was born in a village often bullied by local tyrants. In the winter of the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, I was kidnapped by a local gentry in the city, in collusion with the army! I had to give him 10,000 yuan to escape! As a result, my family business went bankrupt, and I was heavily in debt! I had no choice but to leave my parents, who were over half a century old, and my young wife and children, and come to Nanyang to make a living. Fortunately, heaven has not failed me. When I first arrived in Sand and Sarawak, I was introduced by a friend and obtained a decent job. The treatment is good, and the salary is considerable. But it has been more than four years now. The debts I owed before have been gradually paid off, and my current job is also coming to an end. At this time, I should go home to visit my relatives, but I am afraid that I will still suffer at the hands of local bullies! It is really worrying and hesitant. But there is no Chinese consulate here to issue a passport, and I am not an intellectual who can ask the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission for protection. So I dare not decide to go back. Please, sir, help me find a safe way.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Your family property was taken away by domestic bullies and bandits, and you found a job in Nanyang. In the reporter's opinion, it is better to live there. What value does the so-called "motherland" have that makes you yearn for it? The four northeastern provinces are discarded like worn-out shoes (in reality, not just in words), so how can there be the mood to care about overseas Chinese who are adrift? And how can there be the mind to care about you, a lonely, insignificant, poor scholar? As for us, we are very ashamed, we can't help you either. We can only hope that you will work hard and fight for yourself.</p>

<h3 id="e185">Intangible Losses <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Intangible losses are the great enemy of domestic goods year. Not only are they the great enemy of domestic goods year, but all domestic goods factories, domestic goods companies, and even those who engage in all domestic goods businesses, suffer great losses from intangible losses. If readers don't believe it, let me give a few examples.</p>
<p>㈠ A good factory, the manager does not study the personnel problem too much, and is not good at controlling the workers, so that the workers go from hope to complaint to resentment, so more coal is burned. Motors and gasoline are wasted, materials are wasted, and goods are secretly stolen. Obviously, the business is very prosperous and the interest is very high, but the result is a loss of money. What is the reason? It lies in this intangible loss.</p>
<p>㈡ A good domestic goods store, at first, all the clerks were full of energy and enthusiasm for business. The manager wore nearsighted glasses, only looking at the immediate and one-sided, and the treatment was a little harsh. The clerks put on "old master faces" and dealt with customers lazily. The customer asks a question, and he reluctantly answers it. The customer wants an item, and he reluctantly takes it out. Originally, dealing with customers was all-round, answering all questions, and asking about all items. At that time, the customer only wanted one item, but he was happy to be asked and bought three or four items. Now the clerks' mentality is that they only hope that customers ask less to avoid trouble and annoyance. The manager thinks that the disposal is appropriate, but why don't you go and see the faces of your subordinates? Hurry up and look further and expand your measure? This is also an intangible loss.</p>
<p>㈢ A factory, a store, an organization, all losses are often due to the lack of a plan, a budget. A printed item is printed a lot, and as a result, a large amount of printing costs are thrown into the wastepaper basket and sold as waste newspapers. There is also an organization that prints irrelevant things horizontally and vertically every day. Others throw it in the wastepaper basket, but it takes effort and wastes resources to do this unjust thing. What is the benefit? There is also tap water that is opened carelessly, and electric lights that are used indiscriminately. Partners and students think that this is public property, so they don't care. However, this intangible loss is countless.</p>
<p>㈣ To get rich, everything can be done. Why don't you do this and don't do that, but you have to sell Japanese goods? For one person to get rich, the result is to harm domestic goods manufacturers, harm social economy, and harm national strength. He thinks that he is doing it secretly, without anyone knowing, as long as he can deceive people and earn money, what else does he care about? It is a pity that Shanghai is doing unconscionable things all day long, all year round by these bastards. How can any mathematician calculate this intangible loss?</p>

<h3 id="e186">Upholding the Implementation of the New Tariff <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>A country's officially promulgated tariff rules are, by their very nature, already established, and there is no need to say anything like "upholding" to promote their implementation. However, in our weak country, under the initial promulgation of this new tariff, there have been attempts to obstruct it, which is unreasonable and painful. Originally, our country has been heavily bound by the lack of tariff autonomy for decades. Imperialists rely on all unequal treaties as a protective charm, pushing all surplus production to all parts of our country, seeking the highest profits with the lowest tax rates, and vigorously dumping and plundering. But on the other hand, they raise export taxes, causing our country's exports to suffer a heavy blow, and the decline in foreign trade is increasing, creating an unprecedented increase in the amount of trade deficit, destroying the development of the entire industrial and commercial future, and gradually forming a situation of the guest overwhelming the host. The current decline in our foreign markets and various financial and economic panics can all be attributed to the impact of tariffs over the years, and the astonishing loss of resources. Looking back on the past, we naturally cannot bear to look back. Now that the government has recovered autonomy for many years, May 6 of this year is also the day when the forced signing of the one-sided beneficial Sino-Japanese reciprocal tariff agreement expires. Looking at the world's countries building high tariff barriers to drive out foreign goods, so that imported goods have no foothold, then the implementation of our new tariff this time can at least hope to eliminate old obstacles and promote the sales of domestic goods (in fact, the regulations of this new tariff, although slightly increased, are still far from the world's countries). However, this cunning and insidious Japanese imperialism, disregarding public reason, still wants to coerce. Recently, it is widely rumored that the local Japanese Chamber of Commerce convened a general meeting, gathered to discuss, drafted a letter of request, handed it to the Japanese envoy Arima, and forwarded it to our country's authorities, making unreasonable demands. Their absurd actions and illegal acts have been openly exposed. Tariff autonomy is a common practice in all countries, and the promulgation of tariffs is a matter of internal affairs. Does Japan, which claims to be civilized (?), still not understand this international common sense? Disregarding national rights, what is their intention? If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? Although the National Goods Production and Sales Cooperation Association and various national goods organizations have repeatedly telegraphed the central government to support it, all citizens should unite and rise up to be the support. They deeply know that the increase or decrease of tax rates is the biggest key to promoting national goods and resisting enemy goods, and it is also the key to the rise and fall of industry. Life is related, how can we ignore it? For our own survival and for the sovereignty of the country, we hope that the government will refute according to reason, strictly refuse, and carry out its original intention without any concessions, in order to maintain sovereignty and cultivate the foundation of the country. Then, of course, not only will it be beneficial to the future of our national goods, but also the basis for the economic revival of the entire people's livelihood.</p>
<h3 id="e187">"Bargain," "Sacrifice," and Others <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Ke Ding'an</p>
<p>"Genuine goods at a fair price" is a saying that comes from old businessmen; but new businessmen of the times must also regard it as a standard. For example, a rice store, the price of the rice you sell is balanced, whether it is white glutinous rice or brown glutinous rice, as long as people buy it to cook rice, it has good swelling properties and few impurities, then people will always trust you, and in the future, they will not go to other stores to buy rice. Looking at the above example, these four words "genuine goods at a fair price" can show its effectiveness.</p>
<p>Shanghai is a prosperous city, with shops lined up and dense smoke. Compared with other famous cities, it is even more so. Therefore, those engaged in the national goods business are also setting up factories in Shanghai to produce and promote their sales. It can almost be said that "China's well-known factories are all gathered in Shanghai."</p>
<p>I don't know who was the first person to create it? 丨丨 Forgive me for not being able to find out its origin, 丨丨 is the one who created "big bargains." When he created it, I also knew that it was because the market was not good, and he used "big bargains" as a call. Sure enough, after the news of "big bargains" was revealed in the newspaper, their business was unexpected. Compared with ordinary days, the total number of businesses exceeded several times. This is certainly due to "big bargains."</p>
<p>"Making money" is the most common idea of a businessman. With such a good shortcut to make money, who would be willing to give up? 丨 So one person imitates it, and a hundred people follow it. At first, it was only limited to Shanghai, and slowly spread to towns and major cities. This shortcut to make money is known all over the country.</p>
<p>When the three words "big bargain" gradually lost their effectiveness, smart merchants used their brains to come up with what: "sacrifices," "cheap goods," and what else: "special sacrifices," "very cheap goods," etc. to call on general buyers. At first, it seemed like taking morphine, which was somewhat effective, but later it felt that there was no response. So they used the method of "wool comes from the sheep" to "big gifts," but it could not last forever and would always be eliminated.</p>
<p>Today, the national crisis is getting deeper and the foreign insults are getting more urgent. The great business community 丨丨 including all the ports in the country 丨 are holding × quarter big bargains, special big bargains, × week anniversary big bargains one after another because of the poor business. You are holding them like this, and they are also holding them like this. On one street, almost the eastern side is beating, and the western side is banging, making the ears of the walking people deafening. In principle, with such grand publicity, the business income</p>
<p>should exceed the usual: but after careful investigation, it will even drop below the usual total business volume. What is the reason for this? Half of it is of course that the market is not good, and the purchasing power of ordinary people is weakening accordingly: half of it is because most stores deceive themselves and cannot gain the trust of ordinary patrons, and even some stores with short-sighted eyes hire people to pull and pull at the door. This is even more losing the rules of the store. I think that those who have local responsibilities, if they don't add restrictions, I am afraid it will create an even worse situation, right? In the near future, you will blow your own horn, and I will ignore and not buy. What kind of panic will it become at that time? It's hard to describe.</p>
<p>I think that stores that specialize in selling domestic goods, or large department stores, should especially prohibit new and unique ideas, and should not follow the trend and imitate others. You must know that the sale of domestic goods depends entirely on uniform pricing, 丨丨 what I said</p>
<p>uniform, is based on the lowest standard price, 丨丨 to gain the trust of buyers. Not long ago, just talking about two-pound thermos bottles, some stores' lowest price was one yuan per bottle, then 95 cents, 85 cents, 80 cents, and some people followed the price drop. Now some people are selling them for 75 cents, 丨 these thermos bottles are all domestic goods, 丨 may I ask, is the cost of a two-pound thermos bottle for 75 cents enough? In this way, isn't it going to lose money? A friend said to me like this: "They lose this, earn that, and average it out to still make money." Business secrets, each has its own. There is nothing wrong with investigating. However, such a reduction in pricing and confusion in the market is really unjustified. Therefore, I think that to improve business and gain the trust of society, it is definitely not enough to rely solely on "big bargains" or "big sacrifices" "big gifts." The fundamental and proper method is still to think about "uniform pricing," "small profits," "superior goods," and "no crazy boasting." If you can do this, in the first one or two months, ordinary people will of course not all know it because they are used to buying cheap goods. I think that now ordinary people have a comparative concept when buying things. They see that the goods you sell are cheaper than the big bargains of others, and the goods are more beautiful; then by their oral propaganda, 丨丨 you must know that the effect of oral propaganda is the greatest! 丨丨 In less than half a year, your total monthly business volume will definitely be considerable. At the same time, the slogan "Practice using domestic goods" can be popularized throughout the country, and in the newspapers, you will not see the shocking news of "increased imports of foreign goods."</p>
<p>Domestic Goods Discussion</p>
<h3 id="e188">Regarding the Mobile Promotion of Domestic Goods <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Chengzhu</p>
<p>The call for a domestic goods exhibition is constantly shaking our eardrums. But after a careful examination, apart from the China National Goods Exhibition held a few years ago, and the Henan Mobile Exhibition that traveled thousands of miles and did some enthusiastic work, other exhibitions in the east and exhibitions in the west are either hastily held in a few thatched sheds, or completely occupied by vendors. Moreover, some manufacturers are holding the idea of profiteering, so the effect is really limited.</p>
<p>This kind of domestic goods exhibition that only promotes in the city and does not instill the concept of domestic goods to the upper-level people is really a superficial waving of flags and shouting. In the metropolis, everyone is shouting loudly, but the countryside is still indifferent. We try to see how many kinds of foreign medicines and cosmetics, they do not hesitate to paint large advertisements everywhere in the interior at cost, and even hire small steamships to drive directly to the countryside to half-sell and half-buy. This kind of selling method that has the heart of sacrifice and is different from others is indeed worthy of reference for those engaged in the domestic goods business.</p>
<p>Several domestic goods traveling groups once did some mobile promotion work for a while. They cooperated with local</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Administrative and educational institutions also used anti-Japanese films to help and strong publicity. We are very happy with the hard work they used, but lately it seems not as energetic as before. It is a pity that they lack sufficient economic resources and do not have a central meaning. The biggest reason is that the factories have become passive and do not have sufficient strength to help them, so that a few people shout themselves hoarse, eat and sleep in the open, and as a result, their spirits are scattered and their efforts are wasted.</p>
<p>Therefore, I believe that to measure the meat and land of the domestic goods mobile promotion countryside, and hope that the people can get a deep image, the only first move is to first actively gather from various famous domestic goods manufacturers, prepare sufficient economic strength, and sufficient talent ideas, and wash away the previous malpractices of the exhibition that were hastily perfunctory, and really work hard.</p>
<p>The level of knowledge and discrimination of the people is very shallow. They can hardly distinguish between domestic goods and non-domestic goods. Moreover, due to the recent collapse of the rural economy, it is easy to be fooled into buying enemy goods at low prices for use. In this year, the promotion and promotion of domestic goods to the interior countryside depends entirely on the use of simple signs and ordinary methods. Otherwise, using the sophisticated methods of the city to call on the public to use them will definitely fail.</p>
<p>Secondly, the mobile promotion of domestic goods is not just about running the wharf-style circling and boasting. It should bear the task of investigating the local market conditions, economic conditions, and the trend of domestic goods. It should not only work with local stores, but also provide detailed guidance to merchants on all good steps in operating and selling domestic goods, in order to achieve a close relationship between "production," "marketing," and "sales."</p>
<p>I would like to contribute the above paragraph to the gentlemen who are recently preparing for the mobile promotion of domestic goods.</p>
<p>Domestic Goods Investigation</p>
<h3 id="e189">The Realm of Domestic Goods <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Chang</p>
<p>My country, with its vast land and abundant resources, has a very wide range of so-called domestic goods. But from the perspective of nature, it can be summarized as the following categories:</p>
<p>(1) Local products from all over the country.</p>
<p>(2) Industrial products manufactured with domestic raw materials, domestic capital, and manpower.</p>
<p>(3) Goods made with domestic capital and manpower, plus foreign raw materials.</p>
<p>(4) Goods manufactured by overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>The first two items are pure domestic goods, and there is no doubt about it. The last two items, if not explained, may cause suspicion. Among the relatives and friends of the reporter, there are those who have questioned this, so I will briefly describe my humble opinion below for the readers of this publication to discuss.</p>
<p>My country's industry has not yet developed, and many of the raw materials used by manufacturers are supplied by foreign merchants. Such as steel, such as aluminum, such as dyes, Taiwanese rayon, such as fragrances in cosmetics, such as the enamel color of enamelware, such as the hardening oil of soap, such as the paper pulp of papermaking, such as the carbolic acid of artificial ivory, my country cannot manufacture them ourselves. We hope that these raw materials can gradually be replaced by domestic products, so as to become complete domestic goods. However, before there are substitutes, being able to use foreign raw materials to process and manufacture, so as to resist the finished products of foreign merchants, its benefit to the national economy and people's livelihood is already not small. Can we say that those are not domestic goods?</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese, empty-handed, under the oppression of foreign governments, rely on their own blood and sweat to establish an economic foundation. Every year, they remit a part of their income back to the motherland, which invisibly makes up for a huge outflow of cash in my country's foreign trade. Moreover, their patriotism is far beyond what domestic compatriots can reach. Throughout history, for revolution, for domestic construction, and for the war of resistance against foreign aggression, the amount of money they have donated is in the tens of millions. The businesses they have created overseas, such as Chen Jiageng's rubber industry in Singapore, Yong An Tang's medicines in Yangon, and the swallow's nests of overseas Chinese merchants in Siam. The socks and shirts woven by overseas Chinese in Nanyang, the mats woven by overseas Chinese in Borneo, and the ginseng planted by overseas Chinese merchants in the Americas can all be transported to China and become powerful enemies of foreign goods. Therefore, the goods manufactured by overseas Chinese can be said to be genuine domestic goods, and domestic goods stores in various parts of the country should do their best to promote them, which should not be denied by anyone.</p>
<h3 id="e190">The Way of Women <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Quan</p>
<p>Men have the "way of husbands," so why don't women have the "way of women"?</p>
<p>The so-called women, as the name suggests, are of course the figures of the housewife class, not young girls.</p>
<p>The housewife is the "Minister of Internal Affairs" in the family, and at the same time she also serves as the "Minister of Finance." Her greatness and the importance of her responsibilities can be imagined.</p>
<p>One person concurrently holds two important positions, whether in theory or in fact, must be "of one heart and one mind" and "must be loyal"</p>
<p>to do it. What's more, in the current unprecedented environment of crisis!</p>
<p>The wheels of the times are moving forward relentlessly, and now we have reached the final critical period of the world. Famine, unemployment, and recession are spreading all over the world.</p>
<p>Steel-like facts have been presented to everyone. No one can deny it, and no one can ignore it</p>
<p>!</p>
<p>For this unprecedented personal prosperity and danger, the enlightened women of various countries are urgently implementing coping strategies.</p>
<p>For their own existence and the prosperity of the country and society, they work diligently and frugally, striving to increase income,</p>
<p>and striving for perfection in frugality, striving to reduce expenses. They do not buy a penny of foreign goods, and they advocate domestic goods.</p>
<p>Don't you believe it? Let me give you a few examples!</p>
<p>Have you ever seen Japanese or Russian women spend a penny to buy our valuable goods?</p>
<p>No, no, they would not do this even if they were burned to ashes.</p>
<p>Have you ever seen them indulging in pleasure and wandering all day long?</p>
<p>No, no, they only have work forever! Work! Work!</p>
<p>This is their "way of women."</p>
<p>At the same time, we certainly hope that it will also be the "way of Chinese women"!</p>
<h3 id="e191">Promoting Domestic Goods to the Interior <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Nangong</p>
<p>The universalization of domestic goods in the interior is the urgent need of the moment, and it is also the common goal of the domestic goods industry. Although there are now many enthusiastic people who are actively organizing domestic goods mobile promotion groups, domestic goods traveling groups, domestic goods mobile propaganda groups, etc., they are tirelessly traveling to various parts of the interior to promote exhibitions. Their deep intentions and painstaking efforts, a spirit of fighting for domestic goods, really make us admire them very much.</p>
<p>Here I have a small opinion, which is also my ideal. I am afraid that the smart gentlemen have already seen it, but it may be useful for our mutual exploration. Of course, their current organization is very necessary, but I think that mobile propaganda can only attract the attention of the people in the interior and make them aware of it for a while. It cannot permanently make them understand and supply their needs. It is a passive promotion, not a thorough and fundamental promotion, because mobile work is only stationed in a city or town for a month or ten days to display and sell, and the goods needed by the people cannot be purchased as much as possible in this extremely short period of time, especially in this period of weak rural economy. How can they have the ability to pre-purchase and prepare goods that are not urgently needed for the time being?</p>
<p>Facts tell us that the material enjoyment of the people in the interior, in addition to a part of the self-reliant earth cloth vegetable rice they use, other daily necessities are purchased from nearby towns, and most of the general shops are for profit, and those with patriotic ideas are very rare. Therefore, the goods purchased by the shops from larger cities or metropolises, regardless of whether they are domestic goods, foreign goods, or even inferior goods, only take the low spring price for sale. Therefore, although the people in the interior have patriotic enthusiasm to use domestic goods, they have to purchase them nearby because there is nowhere to inquire. Therefore, the difficulty of domestic goods penetrating into the interior is mostly manipulated by general merchants, forming a separation between producers and consumers!</p>
<p>Now that we have seen the above malpractices, we must find ways to remedy them. The prudent and meticulous road to instill domestic goods into the interior will have many people's planning. Now I will write down the follies of my mind.</p>
<p>Gather funds to create domestic goods general stores or companies in important cities (such as Shanghai, Tianjin, etc.), and set up branch stores in various cities and towns, distributing them according to the size of the market and the convenience of transportation, so that the interior and the city are connected as one, and sign sales contracts with various domestic goods factories, purchasing in large quantities at the lowest price, distributing them to various branch stores, selling them at low prices to reduce the burden on the people, and using shipping vessels for the transportation of goods (such as shipping vessels in various places) to distribute them to branch stores. If so, there will be no shortage of goods needed in the interior, and there will be no worries about the sales of production factories, connecting the supply and demand of producers and consumers, removing the separation between the interior and the city, and further familiarizing themselves with local customs and habits and improving them, there will be great benefits for the future of domestic goods.</p>
<p>Although this organization is similar to a domestic goods introduction center, etc., one is aimed at the capitals of various provinces, and the other is focused on the rural areas of the interior. The methods are the same, but the intentions are different. It is called each doing their best and each showing their strengths.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Our Country's Mosquito Coil Industry (Part 1) <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Songlu</p>
<p>As the weather gradually gets warmer, those detestable mosquitoes will soon come in swarms to wreak havoc. Let us not neglect these small creatures, as they not only disturb our sweet dreams and suck our blood, but also spread malaria, creating a terrifying society! To maintain peaceful sleep and protect their physical safety, humans have had to devise ways to drive them away and exterminate them. Thus, the mosquito coil has become a necessity for summer.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, our country did not have safe and effective mosquito coils. The ones sold in the market were nothing more than locally made mosquito coils rolled from wood shavings and sulfur. These mosquito coils relied entirely on the intense smoke produced during combustion to temporarily drive away mosquitoes. However, due to the pervasive smoke that irritated the nasal passages, and the fact that sulfur and wood shavings both contained slight toxins, they posed a significant health hazard. Moreover, because of their intense heat, carelessness often led to fires. Therefore, some hygiene-conscious individuals preferred to forgo their use and endure the harassment of mosquitoes.</p>
<p>Since the influx of Japanese-made "Pig Brand Anju" mosquito coils into our country, people found their manufacturing method novel and their effectiveness remarkable. Naturally, the superior prevailed over the inferior, and everyone abandoned the old for the new, rushing to purchase them. Domestically produced mosquito coils were defeated, and foreign mosquito coils flooded the Chinese market, resulting in an annual outflow of over one million yuan for our country.</p>
<p>The manufacturing of new-style mosquito coils uses white pyrethrum powder as the main raw material. Pyrethrum is a herbaceous plant that can be rotated with rice, wheat, and beans. It is also extremely easy to cultivate and can be planted on hillsides, in fields, in orchards, and in vegetable gardens, all with great success. Therefore, in countries like the United States, Australia, and Japan, pyrethrum occupies a significant part of agricultural production. The United States has the largest export volume. According to a 1928</p>
<p>survey, dry pyrethrum flowers alone amounted to over 9 million catties, valued at over 6 million yuan. Australia and Japan also produce a substantial amount. In recent years, Japan's export volume has been increasing annually. In 1910, Japan's dry pyrethrum flower export volume was only over 130,000 catties. Through twenty years of dedicated cultivation and vigorous promotion, it reached over 8.3 million catties by 1929. Such a rapid advancement has almost overwhelmed the United States and Australia in the world market and become the leader in the world. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Zhujun</p>
<p>Here, we must state in advance: this is not an unconscious compliment, nor is it an advertisement for anyone. We feel that such a "foreign-educated doctor" is not easy to find in Chinese society. Although he does not boast of being a "big shot," people generally respect him as "China's Gandhi." This time, when Dr. Tai came south, this reporter had the opportunity to interview him. Now, the general content of the conversation is written out to introduce him to the people of the country and to inform those who aspire to promote national products. The reporter asked: "Promoting national products is indeed a matter of urgent importance, but it has been ineffective for decades. What is the reason?"</p>
<p>Dr. Tai replied: "This question is too broad in scope. In general,"</p>
<p>everyone is driven by the desire for beauty and the improvement of material life, and there is no effective organization in society for promoting national products and revitalizing industries. Furthermore, domestic products themselves often remain stagnant, so "promotion" after "promotion" has never been effective."</p>
<p>"Then what remedial measures does the doctor have for this?"</p>
<p>"For more than ten years, I have consistently advocated starting from each individual! Gradually extending to the general public, the most practical method is, of course, only personal thrift, which is what is called social thrift." Once we all stop using foreign goods, the tens of millions of dollars that go out every year can naturally be recovered. After recovering them, what should we do? We should come together to establish urban factories, rural cooperatives, etc., so that workers have food to eat and farmers have money to use, and then engage in production, selling the products throughout the country. This is what is called 'social production.' In short, these two</p>
<p>things are easy to do, but everyone just doesn't pay attention to them! "</p>
<p>Due to space constraints, many unimportant words cannot be written out one by one, but even this is very worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>Dr. Tai is only thirty-five or six years old, different from Lu Zuofu, the Gandhi of Sichuan. He is tall and sturdy, wearing a blue twill homespun worker's uniform, a duckbill cap, which he says is only worth one and a half cents, and black homespun shoes. His demeanor is gentle, his speech and laughter are kind, and he is thrifty and hardworking in everything. No one would know that he is a doctor from "Columbia" University!</p>

<h3 id="e194">Going to the Countryside to Promote National Products <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Licheng</p>
<p>The mosquito repellent incense used in our country in the old days was made of white paper circles, filled with wood chips containing toxic substances. Not only was the thick smoke irritating to the nose and harmful to health, but after burning, all the utensils in the room would change color, so families above the middle class</p>
<p>did not buy them. The mosquito repellent incense sold on the market now uses pyrethrum as the main raw material, supplemented with other fragrances. It is safe and effective, a wonderful product for boudoirs. Unfortunately, pyrethrum is cultivated very little in our country, and most of it has to be purchased from abroad, especially from Japan. As a result, the rights and interests are leaking out, which is not a small amount. The "Samsung Brand" mosquito repellent incense produced by the China Chemical Industry Society has a wide sales network. Recognizing that relying on other countries for raw materials is not a long-term solution, they have established pyrethrum gardens next to the Wusong River and Anlangdu in this city to promote cultivation. The other day, in order to arouse the interest of those who are interested in studying agriculture, the society invited people from all walks of life to visit the chrysanthemum garden. I also joined in and will briefly describe what I saw below. I believe that it will also be welcomed by enthusiastic comrades who promote national products.</p>
<p>At eight o'clock in the morning of that day, we gathered at the society's headquarters on Henan Road, and then rode in sixty Xiang Sheng Company cars, lined up on Aiyia Road. Each car was inserted with a small triangular flag. In addition to the Samsung trademark, the flag also printed the words "Go to the Countryside." After a while, the mighty force sped westward, passing Yuyuan Road, crossing the railway, passing Bili South Road, and getting off at Beixinjing, walking to Anlangdu, a total of more than 400 people. Everyone held paper fans given by the society to ward off the sun. The villagers along the way suddenly saw this large group of people going to the countryside, and they were all surprised. Old people and children leaned at the door and watched from afar. Some mistakenly thought they were going to the countryside to eat wedding banquets, and some thought they were coming to watch the games. The discussions were varied and innocent. The beans in the fields were withered and black, and the wheat was being harvested. Seeing plants more than a foot tall, with flowers like daffodils, everyone did not know what kind of plant it was. When asked the farmers, it was said that it was the "foreign mountain mushroom," which is used in big dishes. Everyone said that people in the city only know how to eat big dishes, but they don't know the foreign mountain mushroom, the raw material for big dishes, which is also a joke. After walking for three quarters of an hour, we arrived at the ferry. Looking at the flower garden from afar, the flowers were in full bloom, like a snow mountain, with a special flavor. Two ferries took turns ferrying people, which took a long time. Arriving at the chrysanthemum garden, there were more than a hundred farmers, with towels covering their heads and cloth bags hanging around their waists, picking flowers. It is said that each person can pick dozens of catties per day, and the labor cost per catty is 20 yuan. These are temporary short-term workers, because the second flower garden covers more than a hundred acres, and when the flowers are in bloom, the original workers are not enough to allocate. Hundreds of paces away from the flower garden, there are two five-bay thatched sheds (for drying and storing flowers) and a three-bay tile house (for workers to live in). The walls are covered with posters stating that the annual value of US pyrethrum dried flower exports is 7 million yuan and "planting pyrethrum to strive for self-sufficiency in raw materials, the purpose of which is to recover rights and interests," and other slogans. After eating Guanshengyuan refreshments in the thatched shed, we went to visit the flower garden. The reception staff explained in detail the cultivation method of pyrethrum, hoping that the visitors would imitate the planting, and that the society could buy the flowers harvested in the future at a good price, because the two chrysanthemum gardens, although they have hundreds of acres, the flowers harvested are not enough. At that time, the red sun was in the sky, and although everyone was sweating profusely, they were all in high spirits and not discouraged at all. Then the society distributed Yili public-use soda water. After drinking wildly, they felt that the scorching sun was not to be feared. The public relations doctor Huang Jingwan said that the experimental field for rural revitalization is centered on production and education, so he has a Chenggeng Work-Study Group near Huanghuacun in that area, and the China Chemical Industry Society's promotion of imitation of pyrethrum cultivation is the same purpose, and he is doing his best to persuade people to cooperate. Then a group photo was taken in the flower garden. When returning, everyone picked a few pyrethrum flowers, either worn on the chest or inserted on the hat, and everyone smiled. Arriving in Shanghai, it was already noon.</p>

<h3 id="e195">Mr. Wang is Happy <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Zengwei</p>
<p>Not far from Shanghai, there lived a Mr. Wang, who was about thirty years old. He had three sons, two daughters, and a wife, a family of seven, all of whom depended on his income as an accountant in a company. However, his income was very low, and since the place was not far from Shanghai, the atmosphere followed Shanghai. The modern ladies of Shanghai mostly liked to use foreign goods, so the middle and upper class people in that place also followed suit and used foreign goods extensively, resulting in a lot of expenses. Mr. Wang's family, although not considered an upper-class family, could be considered a middle-class family, so Mr. Wang's wife and children inevitably wanted to follow the trend and use foreign goods extensively, causing a lot of expenses and overspending. Mr. Wang repeatedly persuaded his family not to adopt the bad habits of the time, and that it would be better to wear homespun cloth and buy domestic goods. His wife and children were not willing to listen. Mr. Wang was so angry that his beard bristled, and he was so anxious that he could not think of a way. He frowned all day and night.</p>
<p>One day, Ah Lin saw Mr. Wang walking alone from afar, heading towards his place. He thought he was going to see his frowning face again. Unexpectedly, after getting closer and greeting him, he saw that Mr. Wang was very happy, with no trace of his previous worries. He was very surprised and could not help but ask what was going on. This question completely revealed the reason for Mr. Wang's happiness.</p>
<p>How did Mr. Wang become so happy? It turned out that through his own efforts, he had completely persuaded his family to use domestic goods. He had really considered it for a while. He thought that if his family was so superstitious about foreign goods, how could his meager income be enough for their expenses? If they continued to overspend year after year, the future consequences would be unimaginable, so he decided to take an opportunity to persuade them not to use foreign goods and to happily use domestic goods. He had just made up his mind when the China National Products Company held a national products fashion exhibition. He thought that he could take this opportunity to take his wife to see it, and perhaps he could change her mind about liking foreign clothing materials. So, when he had nothing to do at the company, he took his wife to visit the fashion exhibition. The result was very good. His wife said, "Domestic fashion is not worse than foreign clothing."</p>
<p>Some time later, the Ningbo Fellow Association held a national products promotion meeting. Mr. Wang thought that this was another good opportunity to persuade his family to like domestic goods. He took advantage of his free time to take his wife and children to participate in the promotion meeting. There were many people speaking at the promotion meeting, explaining the reasons for using domestic goods very thoroughly, and really hitting everyone's hearts. And everyone also swore to buy domestic goods. As a result, the influence on Mr. Wang's wife and children was indeed not small. They changed their minds from then on and no longer used foreign goods.</p>
<p>Since Mr. Wang's family stopped using foreign goods, the national products markets of the city's chamber of commerce and other national products companies often had the traces of Mrs. Wang and his children. But Mr. Wang's economy was much more relaxed. In the past, his monthly salary was never enough for expenses. Now, not only is it very generous every month, but there is also a surplus, because domestic goods are generally cheaper than foreign goods, and they are mostly durable. The styles may not be very good, but this is not important, and practicality is true. Moreover, the manufacturers of domestic goods are now studying improvement.</p>
<p>Once Mr. Wang's economy was relaxed, his frowning face disappeared, so Ah Lin, who had not seen him for several months, saw that Mr. Wang was very happy that day, and Mr. Wang was also very happy to tell him the reason for his happiness.</p>

<h3 id="e196">The Smiling Tiger's Goodwill Diplomacy <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Qinglu</p>
<p>More than twenty people went hiking together. With a gust of bloody wind, a short-legged tiger jumped out of the mountain hollow, baring its fangs, ready to bite people.</p>
<p>If these people all had weapons for self-defense, then it would be more than enough for twenty people to subdue a fierce tiger. Unfortunately, they were all hiking unarmed, and their internal organization was lax, unable to punish the insult in unison. As a result, this tiger, relying on its sharp claws and teeth, wantonly ravaged this group of defenseless people! As a result, four of the twenty people were swallowed by it. According to the tiger's greed, it would be best to eat these twenty people all up, so that none would escape from the tiger's mouth. But, its heart was willing but its stomach was weak. Eating four people was already filling it up, and it had to digest for a while before it could move its appetite again.</p>
<p>Therefore, the tiger stretched its waist, put away its vicious attitude, and became a smiling tiger, saying to those who survived the tiger's mouth: "Dear ones, from now on, I won't eat you anymore. I want to transform the doctrine of eating people into goodwill diplomacy. Dear ones, don't be afraid."</p>
<p>Among the many survivors, one person said to the tiger: "Don't just be good in words. If you really want to show goodwill, why don't you spit out the four people you ate? Even if you can't spit them all out, you can spit out half. Returning our bones after eating our flesh is much better than empty words of goodwill, isn't it?"</p>
<p>The smiling tiger sneered: "Fool, do you think I'm really kind? The 'kin' I'm talking about is the 'kin' of King Tiger robbing a bride. The 'good' I'm talking about is the 'good' of a robber having a good heart."</p>
<h3 id="e197">The Main Gate Stands Wide Open <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Hualing</p>
<p>"The main gate stands wide open, those without money should not enter." This is how people in ancient times described the officials who only saw money. If you didn't spend white, flowery silver ingots, you shouldn't come to sue or file a lawsuit. Therefore, whenever the upright officials returned to the yamen, there were often aggrieved plaintiffs who bumped their heads on the street, blocking the sedan chair to file a complaint, crying and sniveling to cry out their grievances.</p>
<p>In ancient times, only the yamen had its main gate standing wide open, forbidding entry to the penniless. But now, in this year of 1933, it's no longer the case. No matter what place it is, the main gate stands wide open, forbidding entry to those without money.</p>
<p>Just look, with a school every five steps and a university every ten steps, which one doesn't have its main gate standing wide open? But the fees for tuition, food, lodging, books, servants, sports, library, and school construction, when calculated on the abacus, multiplying and dividing, will surely scare the fathers and brothers who earn a penny with a drop of sweat so much that they stick out their tongues and can't retract them.</p>
<p>The banks that have built 18-story buildings have their main gates standing wide open, but the poor laborers are only qualified to stand outside the wide-open gates and stare blankly for a while. Ordinary stores, although they have the words "Welcome to visit" written on their wide-open doors, if you, sir, have no "bills of exchange" and are just wandering around inside endlessly, the salesperson, afraid that you might steal something, will follow you step by step, "extremely sincere in their hospitality," making you feel embarrassed yourself.</p>
<p>Restaurants, hotels, theaters, dance halls, gambling dens, and brothels, without seven qian, one fen and five li, don't even think about walking into the wide-open gates. Even the compassionate old monks in the ancient temples in the forests, if they are holding a donation book, and you, sir, are blushing, your hand reaching into your pocket but unable to pull it out, that "kindly face" will surely make you pass the wide-open gates three times without daring to enter.</p>
<p>The pawnshop doors that stand wide open are said to be convenient for the poor. But a friend who doesn't even have a piece of foot cloth, even if they just want to admire the face of the pawnbroker, might feel a little cumbersome.</p>

<h3 id="e199">Wu Ziyu, Who Hides His Light in the Ancient Capital <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>General Wu Ziyu of Penglai has recently been living in seclusion in Shijin Garden in the ancient capital, dissipating his heroic spirit and deeply hiding his light. When newspaper reporters go to visit him, the gatekeeper always declines them, saying that the master is ill and cannot see guests. In fact, Wu spends his days planting flowers, raising fish, writing bamboo, chanting scriptures, and studying on his own. There is absolutely nothing wrong with his physical health. There is a type of green camellia in the garden, which Wu especially likes to admire. The camellia flower blooms white as snow, which is why Yang Wanli has the line "scattered fragrance snow blows on the railing," and Yuan Haowen has the line "jade tassels lie in the remnants of spring." It is rarely seen in crimson red. And since there is no bamboo in the north, Wu is even more diligent in painting bamboo, so that the verdant shadows of bamboo are always left between the brush and ink, compensating for what nature has not provided. When Lodong was tense, there were rumors outside that he had considerable contact with the Japanese and was about to be active in North China. Wu was very angry when he heard this, saying: In this time of national crisis, Wu has not been able to wield his hundreds of thousands of troops and sharpen his swords to repay the country, and his heart is deeply ashamed. How could he bear to take actions that betray the country and leave himself open to the contempt of the people? Some say that Wu is a person of extremely stubborn nature and is inherently disgusted with the Japanese. In the past, during the Fengzhi War, Wu led hundreds of thousands of brave and fierce soldiers from Sizhao Hall to Yuguan. The grandeur of the army, the abundance of vehicles, horses, guns, and equipment, the soaring momentum, and the earth-shattering sound were very pleasing to Wu. He invited observers from various countries, promising to report the war situation to foreign countries. However, the bottom draft of the report had to be reviewed by Wu before it could be telegraphed, so as to avoid the leakage of secrets. Unexpectedly, Japanese newspapers often published secret messages from Wu's army. Wu was greatly surprised and ordered a search of the observers' trains. He found twelve military pigeons in the Japanese train, which were the source of the secret messages. Wu was furious and immediately executed the twelve pigeons, grinding his teeth and saying: The Japanese are cunning and will surely harm me in the future. Killing the pigeons is to show my determination to eliminate cunning and eradicate deception. This happened in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China. The words are still in my ears, so it can be known that the rumors in the past are absolutely not true. I deeply hope that Wu will take good care of himself, for there is still a day to protect the country.</p>

<p>— You Qi</p>
<p>The time has come again. From that towering and majestic chimney, there is a long and loud roar that is full of arrogance. Following that, as usual, a large crowd of people squeezed out like a tidal wave.</p>
<p>Here, there is no regulation on age, ranging from seven or eight years old to thirty or forty years old. At the same time, there is no regulation on the province of origin. Whether it is Jiangbei, Jiangnan, or people from other provinces, they are all within the "logic." The so-called logic is not that anyone can be "logged" and then "edited." Those who have not gone through a certain stage are also just "staring blankly." Although they have different ages, they have the same line in the haggard expression shown by the long hours of work. Is it intentional "forced smiles" or an expression of "sincere feelings"? They are talking and laughing with each other, even arguing, and striding in messy steps on the bumpy stone road.</p>
<p>The groups of waiters rub their eyes, which they think are blurred, and shoot out greedy light, rotating and sweeping. The tense expression is revealed in everyone's eyebrows, as if they want to capture something, or as if they want to discover something.</p>
<p>The wheelbarrows that have gathered from nowhere are neatly arranged in formation, waiting for the soldiers and generals flashing out from the "banners and flags."</p>
<p>Sure enough, after no more than two "rounds," they were finally captured, disappearing into the glow of the setting sun under the triumphant harmony of the "creaking" sounds.</p>
<p>No hot summer, no cold winter. Day after day, wheelbarrows gather from all directions and return in triumph.</p>

<p>Chapter Eight: Indignant Words Prompt Youth to Resign and Retreat</p>
<p>Warm Hearted Compassion Shown as Maiden Brings Padded Clothing</p>
<p>At this time, Gui Zhi was indeed paying attention to Ji Zhi's actions, thinking that she had stimulated him with those harsh words the other day, and he should have some kind of response. So she waited quietly for two days to see how things would turn out. Unexpectedly, she waited a whole week without seeing any news. Helpless, she had to use the same method as before to inquire about his whereabouts from the maid of the Gan family. According to the maid, one day, the second master packed up his bedding and luggage and left the yamen. It seemed like he was angry with the master, but the master didn't say anything to him at home. According to our mistress, the master recommended him to the city, and he has got a good job. Gui Zhi asked, "Which day did he leave?" The maid said, "It seems to be the day of the Lantern Festival. We ate Yuanxiao that day, and there was one person missing in the family." Gui Zhi thought, it was indeed on the Lantern Festival that she used words to stimulate him. Unexpectedly, he left that day. This clearly shows that he is avoiding me further. Thinking this way, she didn't need to inquire any further and went straight home. This time, just like the last time she heard the news from the old nanny, she couldn't wait to close the door and cry bitterly. However, her mother was doing work in the room and wouldn't allow her to cry again, so she lay on the tea table outside, pretending to doze off, and tried her best to hold back her tears. Seeing this situation in the room, Jiang Shi guessed that she had committed something to her heart again, and thought to herself that she might as well take this opportunity to make a final effort to explore her tone. She said: "Old girl, bring in the two pairs of thread socks that are drying on the rope. Those are all for Company Commander Zhao. I have to sew them for him." Gui Zhi didn't say anything, brought in two pairs of socks, and threw them on the kang. Jiang Shi said: "Do I have to do this little thing? Just find two pieces of cloth and sew the soles for Company Commander Zhao." Gui Zhi took the socks in her hand and looked at them, and said: "The bottom of the socks is not broken, why add a good bottom?" Jiang Shi said: "You don't know, Company Commander Zhao is a man who knows how to live. He knows that it is always difficult for shoes and socks to be on the drill field every day, so hurry up and make up the soles first. In my opinion, this person is good in every way." Gui Zhi didn't say anything, pulled out a drawer in the broken wooden closet, rummaged in it for a while, found two pieces of cloth, and started to mend the soles of the socks on the kang (93)</p>

<h3 id="e202">Choosing a Wife <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Heng Qiu</p>
<p>丨Analysis of Types of Women丨</p>
<p>All those who are unwilling to be monks have a lifelong event丨marriage丨waiting for you to solve. Why did the ancients regard the two words marriage as a major event? Simply put, it is to tell you not to treat it as a trivial matter that is easy to solve! But now the general youth, when the opportunity is rare, see a woman and try their best to attack her; often before they have any understanding of her nature, they have already developed feelings for her. Once there are feelings between men and women, all reason is destroyed. How dangerous is this? Therefore, it has created divorce, abandonment, remarriage∶∶∶all kinds of marital sins.</p>
<p>All those who are unwilling to be monks must marry a wife. To marry a wife, you must be careful. To be careful, you must make a careful selection of each of the people you know. But before the big selection, we must understand what kinds of women there are in society? After several meticulous analyses, I have about five types:</p>
<p>(1) Rural women who can support themselves</p>
<p>She is a wildflower by the roadside, with a natural beauty that is always revealed, and a natural force to feed herself; she does not need artificial irrigation, nor will she emit a strong fragrance to attract people's attention.</p>
<p>(2) Small family women who take marrying a husband as a profession</p>
<p>Their motto is: "Rely on parents at home, rely on husband after marriage." Their only responsibility after marriage is to pass on the family line for their husband. Most of them are very obedient and admit that they are appendages of men.</p>
<p>(3) Daughters of wealthy families who regard their husbands as slaves</p>
<p>They are the proud children of heaven, and they often want to find a gentle and considerate husband to be their personal slave. Therefore, they like to discuss and study the method of "how to make their husbands succumb" the most, because they have a lot of money, and the law can protect them very well, so they are not afraid of their husbands divorcing them.</p>
<p>(4) Romantic women who regard men as playthings</p>
<p>They can use artificial colors to anesthetize men, and they can use perfume and lipstick to exchange for a beautiful life. Most of them are social butterflies, dancers, actors, and others who make a living by their appearance. Their magic power is: they can overturn your reason, they can transfer your joys and sorrows, and they can manipulate your entire life in their hands. But when they encounter powerful people, they themselves will become men's playthings.</p>
<p>(5) Modern girls with considerable knowledge</p>
<p>Most of them are school teachers, company employees, and red flower vases in government agencies. They all have considerable knowledge. Because they can be independent, they all think they are the most modern women. They look down on any kind of women. Their eyes seem to be born on their foreheads, which can be said to be extremely arrogant. Therefore, it is not easy to be their husbands. Unless they have more knowledge, wealth, and status than them, they can never escape their contempt.</p>
<p>Because there are also many kinds of men, I don't need to determine which kind of woman is the best. I just need to: clarify the types of women before starting the first step of choosing a wife 丨 determine which kind of woman is most suitable for your own environment, 丨 after determining, start to find a woman among the types you have determined whose personality, knowledge, and appearance are suitable for you to be a wife (as to whether she thinks you are suitable or not is another question), then you can always get a really happy result.</p>
<p>Many young people do not have enough common sense in choosing a wife, and they only pay attention to small goals, thinking that as long as the personality, knowledge, and appearance are suitable, it is enough, but they do not know the importance of the big goal 丨 analyzing the types of women 丨, thus causing all kinds of marital tragedies. Because her personality, knowledge, and appearance, although you think they have passed, when her status and environment do not match you, you will get unexpected disappointment. Young people! Young people who are unwilling to be monks! Be careful of your major events</p>

<p>(Manila Special Dispatch) With only one year left before the 10th Far Eastern Games, the Philippine sports community is extremely tense about the preparations for the Games. The Philippine Sports Association is now cooperating with the Manila Municipal Authority to transform the city's existing Lira Ditiro sports field for use as the athletic field for the next Far Eastern Games. The renovation project has been completed, and its scope is no less than that of the Meiji Jingu Athletic Field of the previous Games. In addition, a large swimming pool is being built near the field, which is currently under construction. The pool is 50 meters long and 20 meters wide, and the viewing stand can accommodate 5,000 people. The basketball court will be located at the basketball court of Santo Tomas University. The court is great, with seating for 5,000 around it, so no special construction is required. As for the baseball and volleyball courts, a suitable location has not yet been selected, but it is expected to be completed before the opening of the Games. If necessary, it will be located inside the athletic field. The soccer field is attached to the center of the athletic field, and the tennis courts are already well-equipped tennis courts used by the carnival.</p>

<p>Defeated North Grassland 13 to 2</p>
<p>Chinese Team Currently in First Place</p>
<p>In the Shanghai Grass Tennis Club League A, the Chinese Tennis Club won a second major victory tomorrow, defeating North Grassland 13 to 2. In the five groups, each group had an advantage and won easily. Last week, North Grassland defeated the French Business Association 11 to 4. From this perspective, the Chinese Team's smooth sailing this year should be no problem. However, it all depends on the efforts of each person. The results of each group are as follows:</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai 6 to 3 Ke Erque</p>
<p>(China) 6 to 3 (North)</p>
<p>Liang Deguang 6 to 4 Shi Duke</p>
<p>Jiang Daozhang 6 to 3 Smith</p>
<p>(China) 8 to 6 (North)</p>
<p>Yu Tianguang 2 to 6 Na Xu</p>
<p>Zheng Zhaojia 6 to 3 La Aide</p>
<p>(China) 6 to 3 (North)</p>
<p>Yin Yaobin 7 to 5 Fu Bobosi</p>
<p>Sun Linfang 6 to 3 Pai Late</p>
<p>(China) 6 to 2 (North)</p>
<p>Zhou Guanjun 6 to 2 Mo Er</p>
<p>Zheng Zirong 4 to 6 Ke Liege</p>
<p>(China) 6 to 4 Mi (North)</p>
<p>Zhou Huaful 6 to 4 Xi Po</p>
<p>Among the five groups, the first and third groups are the most impressive. Liang and Qiu are a good match and play very well, making them worthy of first place. Shi Ke is also a fierce general, but not enough to compare, only seeing him tired of running around. Zheng and Qian are a group of young heroes, brave and terrifying. Not only are their shots wonderful in hitting the ball, but their cooperation is also very satisfactory. Yao Bin has made rapid progress and is worthy of admiration. His forehand and backhand shots have improved a lot compared to before. The fourth group, Sun and Zhou, is acceptable, but the second and fifth groups had more difficulty winning.</p>

<p>(Tianjin Correspondence) The Hebei Province preliminary election for the North China Games track and field competition was held on the 3rd and 4th of this month.

Otherwise, the results would have been considerable. The order of the conference was quite good. During the two days of competition, there were no disputes in any of the events, which is very rare.</p>

<p>The cry for freedom is present in every era. I, however, said last time, "Do not want freedom," as if deliberately trying to be strange. But freedom must have limits, must have scope, isn't this what people often say? And most people recognize these words. Freedom that has scope and limits, can it still be freedom? Then, it is better not to have freedom at all.</p>
<p>The struggle for freedom often arises between groups and individuals. Groups often want to limit individual freedom, interfere with individual freedom, and deny individual freedom. If an individual is a member of a group, if he understands that he belongs to the group, he will always be willing not to have freedom, and allow the will of the group to dominate. Because individuals and groups cannot be opposed, the status of the group is higher than the individual, and the group has absolute dominance.</p>
<p>The composition of a group is based on the common and consistent interests of that group. Therefore, the interests of the group are the interests of all the members of the group. The group's absolute power of dominance is based on this point. However, when the organization of a group becomes ill, so that it cannot represent the common interests of a group, each individual feels dissatisfied with the dominance of the group, and the cry for freedom is then issued.</p>
<p>For example, the state was originally organized for the welfare of all the people, and the people always obey the central government and support the government. But when the people realize that a national government is only an institution for collecting taxes, exploiting, and oppressing, the people have a cry for freedom. All the facilities of the state, not taking the welfare of the people as a prerequisite, have already lost the original purpose of the group organization, that is, they have become ill, so there is this discovery of the disease.</p>
<p>The cry for freedom is really a symptom of disease. A clever ruler knows that a disease must be treated, while a stupid one is often very stupid, does not recognize that it is a disease, treats the power of the group as divinely ordained, and does not see the common interests in the fundamental place, and wants to abuse that power to suppress. Then, they will get to the point where it cannot be cleaned up. These fools do not understand the meaning of the group, nor do they understand the basis of power. They rashly engage in politics, which is as dangerous as a blind man driving a car.</p>
<p>Those who feel alarmed by the cry for freedom are still capable of being made. Only stupid people persistently adopt high-pressure policies, and as a result, they will inevitably trigger an explosion of freedom.</p>
<h3 id="e241">Talking About the Eleventh Art <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Li Jinming</p>
<p>When you reach a certain age, entertainment becomes boring. I remember ten years ago, because I felt that I was not a Philistine, I wanted to get involved in anything new, especially movies. Later, my experience of the world gradually changed, and I felt that what movies love to show is not very believable, so I didn't think about it for five or six years. But I didn't know that in these five or six years, movies have made remarkable progress. In terms of both content and technique, they sometimes surpass many great literary works. (Thought cannot be discussed!)</p>
<p>I think that the reason why movies have become an art, and movie stars have become the eleventh muse, is mostly due to the director. In the four films—"Kurier", "The Big House", "Morocco", "Grand Hotel"—I not only saw the directors' ability to manipulate the acting talent of the stars, but also their ability to choose excellent literary themes, and their ability to find some formulas in aesthetic methods, to turn plain impressions into strong impressions, and to turn a plate of bean sprouts into the flavor of curry chicken.</p>
<p>Although "Kurier" is a romance, there is not a single slack spot from beginning to end—the best thing is its contrast (these are all terms in aesthetics and rhetoric). As the saying goes, sorrow is seen through joy—this is originally the principle of drama, and it can be seen in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, where there are jokes. In Chinese old dramas, a play of "Si Lang Visits His Mother" must be followed by a play of "The In-Laws Enter the City to Collect Additional Taxes", which is also this kind of gimmick, but it depends on whether you compare it accurately or not. To put it bluntly, "Kurier" is completely classical; clearly you feel that this kind of thing will not happen, but after watching it, it has to make you believe it.</p>
<p>"The Big House" and "Grand Hotel" are completely realistic, while "Morocco" is realistic and has a symbolic flavor. Some people say that "The Big House" is also symbolic; Wallace Berry's thug represents the revolution, and Louis Stone's prison guard represents the reaction. As a result, the reaction leveled the revolution, and it seemed to say that under the red light, the royalist thoughts of Mussolini and Hitler came out. In art, it is not necessarily something that cannot be written about. However, this kind of explanation, in my opinion, is like professors researching "Dream of the Red Chamber", not necessarily reliable; it is inevitable that it is completely realistic, as long as the audience can experience some prison life. The most touching thing is the revival of Christian thought inside.</p>
<p>"Morocco" is simply an epitome of the life of a fugitive lair. Marlene Dietrich's success is truly amazing. (In my opinion, she is ten times better than Garbo.) Intrigue, insidiousness, assassination, fate, and revenge—in this composition, the heroes and beauties that are born really have nothing that makes people think it is artificial. The ending still says: Love, go to the desert! This is like saying: The bluebird exists, but it cannot be kept in a cage. . . . Comparing "Grand Hotel" to "The Big House" and "Morocco" is like comparing naturalism to realism; the content is not tense, and under the light performance, you see life and death, tragedy and comedy in urban life, and it seems to carry some lessons on how to be a human being.</p>
<p>If China could produce this kind of film, and even if it is subject to all kinds of restrictions, it would not necessarily be glorious.</p>
<h3 id="e242">Ah Lin <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— Peng Xuezhen</p>
<p>Late at night, I emerged alone from Lin Niu's house, securing the broken door, and strolled along the street filled with the whispering June evening breeze.</p>
<p>Just three days ago, Lin was speaking with joy and hope, still supporting her faltering steps to come and go, her face always adorned with a smile. What happened now, that she lies stiffly there, with white wax candles lit at her head!</p>
<p>I gazed at the pair of newborn children lying on Lin's bed, their cheeks flushed with the unique redness of infants, their little eyes closed in slumber. These two ignorant children do not yet know that their mother has left this human world forever, just as they have stepped into this world of light, just as they have opened their slender little eyes.</p>
<p>In the crying of the children is buried the robust life of the young mother, although the children cry because of unease or fear of the new world, Lin gazes at her elderly mother standing before the bed, gazes at the many people around her, known or unknown, and writhing her entire body, begins her journey to another world. Perhaps this journey is eternal, filled with fresh experiences.</p>
<p>Lin was a woman of candid heart. The face tanned by labor under the sun could never hide her healthy skin. She did not speak much, but every word was sincere, convincing to the listener. Every day she would rise so early in the morning to wash clothes, the clear water flowing under the bridge, Lin barefoot, squatting by the riverbank, every strike of the wooden club imbued with the life of her and her mother. Every afternoon they would go to various places to collect clothes, using their hands, plus water and sunlight besides the soap, they truly lived in the gifts of nature.</p>
<p>But one day, Lin suddenly disappeared. It was said that she had left with a man. The old mother, squinting her eyes, told people that her daughter had gone to another city to enjoy good fortune.</p>
<p>"You see, soon Lin and her son-in-law will come to pick me up, and we will no longer suffer, washing clothes, winter is truly bitter." The old woman smiled mysteriously, but the busybodies did not quite believe her words, making wild guesses.</p>
<p>The days flowed away like the water under the bridge, never to return.</p>
<p>Just as when she had left, one day, Lin suddenly quietly slipped back, wearing clothes she had never had before, her eyes appearing sunken, often lost in thought, no longer as lively as before, the old woman no longer smiled and laughed in front of people.</p>
<p>Lin deteriorated further, washing clothes listlessly on the river beach every day, sometimes gazing silently at the river for a long time, returning home with a bitter expression.</p>
<p>No one knew Lin's secret, and no one knew the sorrow in her heart. People simply sighed inexplicably for this girl.</p>
<p>Lin's belly grew bigger day by day.</p>
<p>Childishly, Lin shyly sewed clothes for her future child under the sun, a smile revealing the joy of motherhood, but that joy contained a deep-seated resentment.</p>
<p>Now, Lin has passed away with her secrets and sorrow. Isn't it the dead Lin lying there today? In the sea of life, a bubble has dissolved, carried away by a wave.</p>
<p>Like a ghost, I walked eastward, the river surging as if sobbing, and in the shadow of the ancient trees by the roadside, I felt Lin walking towards me, as lively as before, coming to our alley to collect clothes.</p>
<h3 id="e243">Children <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Su</p>
<p>For several days, I hadn't left my house because I wasn't feeling well; today, I went to see a doctor and took a walk outside.</p>
<p>The places I passed were still the narrow alleys, the sunless streets, and the dusty roads. In those places, I saw many children.</p>
<p>Groups of children gathered in the streets, jumping, running, shouting, and making noise; no one stopped them, and no one protected them. They ran wildly from street to street, as if the street was their only paradise.</p>
<p>In every patch of empty ground along the walls, there were several children tossing coins. They seemed very interested in this activity, staying there for a long time.</p>
<p>As I passed through a quiet alley, a child led a blind child past me; he kept his eyes tightly closed, one hand resting on the shoulder of the child in front, gently tapping a small stick, slowly traversing the secluded alley with his companion.</p>
<p>On the road: three bare-chested children dragged three strings of worn-out straw sandals, panting as they walked; a pre-pubescent rickshaw puller struggled to pull an empty cart, soliciting business from passersby; under the shade of a tree, a woman was feeding the baby in her arms, and standing beside her were several children, who, upon seeing someone approach, would follow behind them, singing: "Good sir, good master, please do a good deed!" extending their hands, hoping people would give them a third of a big pancake as the price.</p>
<p>In front of the garbage bins by the roadside, children scavenging through the trash were bent over, searching in the bins; scraps of torn cloth, empty tin cans, glass bottles, meat bones, chicken and duck feathers, these were all their treasures, which they carefully picked up and placed in their small baskets.</p>
<p>At the foot of the big bridge, two or three children were waiting; when a rickshaw crossed the bridge, they would race each other to push the rickshaw from behind, one hand pushing and the other hand extended, begging for money from the person riding in the rickshaw, whispering "Sir, sir," following them all the way from one side of the bridge to the other.</p>
<p>One of the passengers said, "There are so many children in the streets that they are crowded!"</p>
<p>Returning home, I opened the newspaper that had just arrived, and in one corner was published: "Two Students Simultaneously Missing</p>
<p>丨Will States They Will Enter the Mountains to Seek the Tao"</p>
<p>Ah! These children! Is there anyone who thinks about these children, who is willing to save these children?</p>

<p>— Translated by Lin, from Jules Renard</p>
<p>Spring Water (Continued)</p>
<p>Godfather丨Sleep, you beast, sleep!</p>
<p>But the godfather and godson could not fall asleep. Red Carrot Whiskers tossed and turned, suffocating, seeking air to breathe, which made his old godfather feel a little sorry for him.</p>
<p>Suddenly, just as Red Carrot Whiskers was about to fall asleep, the godfather grabbed his arm and said:</p>
<p>"Are you here, you beast? I'm dreaming, I feel like you're still in the spring water. Do you remember the time you fell into the spring water?"</p>
<p>Red Carrot Whiskers丨As clear as if I were still in there right now, Godfather. I don't blame you for it, but you often bring it up to me.</p>
<p>Godfather丨Poor beast, I shudder all over whenever I think about it. I was asleep on the grass then. You were playing by the spring water, you slipped, you fell into the spring water, you were shouting, you were struggling, and I, damn it all, didn't hear anything. The spring water wasn't very deep, only good enough to drown a cat, but you didn't stand up. That's where the trouble lies, didn't you think to stand up then?</p>
<p>Red Carrot Whiskers丨Do you think I can still remember what I was thinking when I was sinking into the spring water!</p>
<p>Godfather丨In the end, you making such a racket in the water finally woke me up. Luckily, you didn't drown. Poor beast! Poor beast! You were spitting like a water dragon. Someone changed your clothes for you, put you in Little Belna's Sunday clothes.</p>
<p>Red Carrot Whiskers丨That's right, those clothes made me itchy all over. I was scratching all over. It was practically a 　-lined garment.</p>
<p>Godfather丨No, it was because Little Belna didn't have a clean 　shirt to lend you. I'm laughing now, but back then, if it had been one more minute, no, one more second, you would have been dead.</p>
<p>Red Carrot Whiskers丨Then I would be far away from you now.</p>
<p>Godfather丨Don't say that. I'm even saying some stupid things. Since that mess happened, I haven't slept a good night. I suffer from insomnia, this is my punishment; I should be suffering this punishment.</p>
<p>Red Carrot Whiskers丨And me, Godfather, I shouldn't be suffering this punishment, I really want to fall asleep.</p>
<p>Godfather丨Sleep, you beast, sleep.</p>
<p>Red Carrot Whiskers丨If you want me to sleep, Godfather, then please loosen my hand. Let me sleep soundly before you grab me again. And please spread your legs apart too, because the hair on your legs is making me terribly itchy. I can't fall asleep no matter what when someone is touching me.</p>

<p>The gold market was stable yesterday but then weakened. The situation is still average. Initially, overseas silver markets saw London falling and the US rising. The forward silver price on the Five Metals Exchange fell. US cotton also slightly 　. Stock prices both rose and fell. Private electricity prices retreated to just over 125. The raw price opened at 35.6 yuan, with Cuitai selling only at 35 yuan, and people's minds were relatively stable. Dachengyuan, Chuncingfa, Yongdeng, and others successively earned and bought. The initial opening price was flat, but then it tightened again. The opening price rose slightly, but the intraday supply exceeded demand, and the situation hardened, rising to 41 yuan. Later, it gradually moved downstream. HSBC's listing revealed that the British market was flat, while the US market rose by 125, with little fluctuation. In the end, the foreign exchange market hardened further. Reuters reported that the US Treasury Secretary announced the issuance of 500 million yuan in treasury bills and 400 million yuan in bonds, and the price fell sharply. Speculator Mr. Lu and Western merchants sold vigorously. It was found that the sellers had consistently been in a more advantageous position throughout the day, and Western merchants such as Xiangmeng also supplied. The process seemed chaotic, with the cooked price calculated at 68 yuan. The Tian market situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 939 yuan, slightly higher by 1.2 yuan compared to the previous closing. The physical opening was 8.5 yuan. The foreign exchange market opening was also tight. The recent selling price was estimated at 1 shilling 3 pence for British currency and 25.1875 yuan for US currency. Yuanyong immediately bought, gradually rising from 8.2 yuan. Richang also entered, and the price rose twice to 41 yuan. August US dollars were hard to sell at 75. Fuchang, Yifeng, and Yongfuyu all sold, contending at around 40 yuan. After entering, there were no buyers for August US dollars at 8125. Western merchant Xiangmeng sold off contracts. Richang then re-entered and then exited. Dachengyuan, Yuanshengyong, Fuchang also sold, and the price retreated to 36.1 yuan. Huabi ate August US dollars at 875. Richang, Hengxing, Dafayong all entered, while Daxingyong exited, and the situation was still stable. Maijiaili ate September 0625. At this time, it hovered around 8 yuan. HSBC's listing revealed that the British market was flat, while the US market rose by 125. Afterwards, Yuanyong still came to buy, adding to over 9 yuan, but because 0625 September was difficult to sell, the price fell, and the situation suddenly turned vague. Zhejiang ate July 625, and was still able to rebound, but the supply within the 　was more surging. Large firms such as Fuchang, Yuanshengyong, Yuanyong, Dachengyuan, and Qingfayong all sold. Holland sold July US dollars at 625. Fuyu then sold down to 4.5 yuan, because Zhengjin sold August US dollars at 875. Although Richang, Tianfengyong accepted, foreign telegrams reported that the United States had issued a huge amount of bonds, and people's minds were greatly shaken. Hengxingyuan and Daxingyong sold vigorously. Datong even sold July US dollars at 75, and October US dollars at 3125 also had no buyers, and the price fell to 31 yuan. Maijiaili ate September US dollars at 1875. Fuyu, Qingfayong, and Dachengyuan took advantage of the low price to replenish their positions, and it rose to 5 yuan. Zhongfu sold September 1875, and Maijiaili also sold August 9375. Yongfeng and Dachengyuan suddenly sold, and the price fell again to 2.8 yuan. Finally, Yuanchunchang, Shengyong all entered, and the afternoon closing was 934.2 yuan. Physicals closed at 49. It was found that the highest price during the day was 941 yuan, and the lowest was 931 yuan, with a difference of 10 yuan. As a result, the closing price fell by 3.6 yuan compared to the previous closing.</p>
<p>The revealed price rose by 125 due to HSBC's listing, to 25 yuan, which combined to drop the gold price to 960 yuan. Based on the closing price, the 　is less than approximately 26 yuan, which is about 1 yuan less than before. This month's recorded price is 947 yuan, and July's is 934 yuan. The morning water replenishment price is 947 yuan, with the cooked price calculated at 68 yuan. The market was extremely quiet, with a lack of incoming supplies, making it difficult for each spot firm to meet the market demand. Swap trading also lacked formal matching, and each firm did not pay attention. This month's contracts are still counted at 4,879 contracts.</p>
<p>Market trading was not very active, and the situation was extremely chaotic. In summary, Hengxing, Wanxing, Shunli, Yuanyong, Richang, Tianfengyong, Qingfayong, Yuanchun, Dafayong, etc., were on the buying side, while Fuchang, Fuyu, Dachengyong, Yongfeng, Hengxingyuan, Daxingyong, Yuanshengyong, Cuitai, Ruikang, etc., were on the selling side. Dachengyuan and Qingfayong advanced and then exited. The Dalian gang Wanxing轧进了 280 contracts, and Shunli轧进了 364 contracts. The Guangdong gang Hengxing bought in not much. The total number of July筹码 is 23,863 contracts.</p>

The Dalian gang wanted to seek a British-US exchange rate of 4.1 yuan plus zero for September, estimating 1 shilling 1875 and 26 yuan for US dollars, but the bank refused, and the situation hardened.

<p>The market transaction was very leisurely yesterday, and the拆息 market price opened at 8 points in the morning and afternoon, which was equal to the previous day's afternoon market.

<p>Due to筹码 Relations, Fell by a Few Corners to 1.5 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, the market gradually turned weak from chaos. There was no shortage of large-scale long positions emerging on the market. In fact, in the previous few days, the bullish sentiment of each gang was too strong, and the market price rose sharply for two days. All kinds of floating positions had mostly been leveled out, resulting in few customers at one time, and only seeing more sellers and fewer buyers. This was also due to the筹码 relationship for a time, and the supply and demand could not be balanced. If there are no special changes, it should not be about the overall situation. In the first market in the morning, the opening was slightly higher by 1 corner to 3 corners or so. Then, with the selling of No. 11 being extremely surging, No. 2 tried its best to maintain it, but the weak phenomenon was very obvious, causing all bonds to tend to move downstream from 19, with each bond falling by as much as 1, 2 corners to 6, 7 corners. In the second market, due to the general trend, the selling side was even more powerful, and it fell consistently by 1, 2 corners to half a yuan. When the market opened in the afternoon, it continued to fall by 1, 2 corners to half a yuan at the beginning. After entering the 拍统税, Nos. 5 and 50 absorbed quite a bit, and then rebounded by 2, 3 corners. People's minds seemed to have turned slightly stronger again, and the closing was slightly better with the trimming of the troops by editing, while the rest were still trending downward, falling by 2, 3 corners to 6, 7 corners. There were slight unfounded rumors on the market, perhaps to create an atmosphere, so let's just see what happens. As a result of the market price, except for 18 Customs, which rose slightly by 2.5 corners, the rest fell by several corners to about 1.5 yuan. The total number of transactions was 19.908 million yuan, including 8,000 yuan in spot goods. The futures统盐税 accounted for 7,425,000 yuan,裁兵 accounted for 3.35 million, and 19 Customs善 accounted for 2.73 million, 20卷20 Customs accounted for 3.755 million yuan, and the rest ranged from tens of thousands to 450,000.</p>

<p>The Yarn Market is Falling Madly and Abruptly</p>
<p>The yarn market is greatly weakened and the falling is crazy and violent. One is because the US cotton weather is good and falling. The second is that the first batch of US cotton bought on credit will arrive in Shanghai within 50 days. The rumour is extremely popular in the market, so people are greatly alarmed, and at the same time, the actual demand is even more stagnant, so the散多 is showing more and more不安. However, the current situation is abnormally chaotic, and a certain country's yarn has fallen from 206 yuan to 195 yuan.</p>
<p>People's Standard fell by 3.8 yuan, and at the opening of the previous market, with US cotton falling by more than 10 pounds, people's spirits were low, and each month fell by more than 1 yuan. The second and third markets fell again, and as a result, each month fell by 1.7 to 2.5.6.9 corners. The opening of the afternoon market was still virtual, and each month fell by 1.3.5.6 corners again. The total number of transactions for the whole day was统计 78,250 bales. It was found that Dafeng sold 4,200 bales, Renfeng 2,650 bales, Tonghe 2,500 bales, Shenchang 1,100 bales, and Changfeng 1,200 bales. Ruida bought 1,600 bales, Tongfu 1,350 bales, Yichang 2,300 bales, Yichang 2,150 bales, Taichang 1,600 bales, and Daji 1,400 bales. The closing price is listed below.</p>

<p>The Falling Wind of the Cotton Market is Sharp, Because the US Cotton Market Situation is Not Good, and the General Rise is Too Much</p>
<p>In view of the fact that the Chinese government's purchases of US cotton have not 　　　since　　, various factories do not have to worry about shortages. As a result, the bulls are frustrated, and the amount that is about to be advanced is cleared out in large quantities, so the market shows signs of collapse. The future situation is still difficult to tend high. Zheng Biao fell by more than 1 yuan. At the opening of the Zheng Biao market, it fell with the poor external cotton, and the second and third markets fell step by step, and the people's spirits were weak. There was a lack of buyers in the market, and each month fell by about 1.1 yuan. In the afternoon, each month fell by another 2 corners. The total transaction volume was统计 183,300担. It was found that Changfeng sold 11,400担, Dachang 4,000担, Yuchang 4,600担, Yuanfengchang 7,700担, Dafeng 3,100担, and Mingde 2,400担. Suilong bought 6,800担, Guangfeng 3,000担, Yichang 3,700担, Tonghe 4,100担, Yuanda 6,300担, and Chunjie 2,300担. The closing price is listed below.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market experienced mixed conditions. Favorable weather and bull market profit-taking led to a decline. As a result, spot prices fell by 15 points per pound, and futures prices fell by 12 points per pound. The Liverpool cotton market saw no change in spot prices, while futures prices fell by 8 to 9 points. The Egyptian cotton market saw no change in spot prices. The Bombay cotton market initially rose following the U.S. market but then weakened due to bull market profit-taking. Consequently, Pingar rose by 3 rupees, while Omra and White Western both rose by 3.5 rupees. Original telegram on the left (dated June 6th).</p>

<p>Chongde Cocoon Firm Closed: Chongde's cocoon production only reached 30-40% of previous levels, and the firm's receipts were insufficient. Weighing and transactions have now ceased, and the firm has closed. Cocoon prices reached a maximum of 45 yuan for foreign varieties and a minimum of 25 yuan for local varieties.</p>
<p>Changxing Cocoon Prices Relatively Stable: Cocoon firms are gradually ceasing weighing and transactions, with receipts only reaching 50%. The highest cocoon prices are for improved varieties, ranging from 40 to 45 yuan, while local varieties range from 26 to 32 yuan.</p>
<p>Dantu Foreign Varieties Show Little Shrinkage After Drying: Cocoon production is still abundant, and the cocoons are of relatively good quality. Firms are actively weighing and collecting, and the account books are quite lively. Cocoon prices reached a maximum of 50 yuan (for improved variety cocoons), with a drying shrinkage of only 280 catties. Local variety cocoons were priced at 32.3 yuan.</p>
<p>Changshu High-Quality Cocoons Expected to Rise: The number of silkworms raised this year has decreased. Although cocoon production is abundant, many cocoon firms have opened for business. Prices for improved variety cocoons are expected to rise. The initial opening price was 34-35 yuan, which then rose to 37-38 yuan. The current opening price is 40 yuan. The initial opening price for local variety cocoons was 25-26 yuan, which has now reached 30 yuan.</p>
<p>Nanjing Cocoon Reeling Shrinkage is Small: Improved varieties account for 70-80% of production. The cocoons are of relatively good quality. According to the results of trial reeling in Shanghai, the drying shrinkage of improved variety dry cocoons is only 450-460 catties (i.e., 100 catties of raw silk). High-quality local variety cocoons show 560-570 catties.</p>
<p>Changjiang (Yangtze) Trading Houses Continue to Import Artificial Silk: Sichuan, Hubei, and Hunan firms have declared imports of brands such as Golden Double Deer, Black Beauty, Golden Unicorn, and Paida Wu, etc. Forty-eight cases of futures for June and July were traded at prices ranging from 181.75 yuan to 172.25 yuan net.</p>
<p>Shanghai Silk Market Expects Rise in Prices; Holding Back: Yesterday, New York silk prices soared another 5 points, with the current silk price at US$1.80 per pound. Yokohama silk prices also rose sharply by 35 yen, with the price at 945 yen. Shanghai Chinese silk fell sharply but rebounded slightly. Yesterday, overseas yellow and white silk both had incoming orders, but the arrival prices only rose by 1.20 yuan. Sales were difficult due to heavy cost, and sentiment is bullish with the market holding back. Fifty bales of Lu factory silk and eighty bales of Shanghai White factory silk were transacted at a price increase of 20 yuan. Fifteen bales of Sichuan factory silk and three bales of coarse yellow silk were also priced firmly.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the Shanghai tea market, merchants from Yingzhuang, Jinlong, Yihe, and Xiehe, etc., began processing Zhenmei green tea from Wudong, Tunxi, Yin County, and other regions. The market showed slightly more activity. Needle-shaped Zhenmei was particularly popular, and prices were quite firm. Due to demand signaled by telegram from Bombay, merchants from Gaoli Zhuang Gongxi, Baitou Zhuang Qianyi, and Yulong, etc., in Wuyuan also began searching for green tea, which was slightly more stable than before. Although British merchants such as Tianxiang and Baochang, etc., started processing Qimen black tea, the volume was not large, and market prices were weak.</p>
<h3 id="e257">Grains: Rice Prices in Both Northern and Southern Markets Fall Frequently <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai): Sources from more than 50 stores; both are sluggish, and the situation is dull. Changbang, Sujian Japonica, and Nangang thick rice prices are slightly lower by one or two jiao. Only high-quality rice is slightly fresher in color. Qingjiao, Songsi, Xilian, and other thin rice varieties from Jinping and Weisanbang continue to process one thousand several hundred packages, and the price also fell by two jiao. Du Yangjian follows Japonica rice by a small amount of jiao. The exchange is balanced. The market shows no significant gains or losses.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai): Eight or nine boats from the Hexia region. White rice sales are slow, the market is sluggish, and surrounding areas lack trade, causing prices to weaken. Thin rice is dull, and prices are slightly lower by a small margin. Early rice is down by one or two jiao. Yangdu has continuous arrivals, and sales are still acceptable, but prices are down by a few fen. Wharf customer Jianjiao is sluggish, and the exchange is flat and weak. Although there are few arrivals of Baiyuan, there is still stock in the river, and retail discounts are not working. Gao Dingzhong carries a weak tone.</p>
<h3 id="e258">Northern Merchants are Buying Saigon Rice <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign merchants experienced divergent trends in rice prices. The stock of Xiang and Gan rice among the guest rice varieties is very sufficient, and sporadic small quantities continue to arrive at the port. However, sales rely solely on the Fuzhou group. Since the demand from Fuzhou has weakened, sentiment is soft, and merchants are mostly seeking to sell early. Although the Wenzhou group has sales, the volume is ultimately not as large as that of the Fujian group. Yesterday, the Wenzhou group only purchased Nanjing and Wuxi indica rice. Xiang and Gan rice are still purchased exclusively by Fujian merchants. Due to the weak market, transactions are more frequent by small margins. 2230 bags were sold, Nanjing and Wuxi machine-milled rice were at the Shanghai Railway Station Bureau, Nanjing machine-milled rice was at 7.57 yuan, Wuxi machine-milled rice was at 7.60 yuan, Jiangxi machine-milled late rice was at 8.35 yuan, Hunan secondary machine-milled oil rice was at 8.35 yuan, rough red rice was at 8.15 yuan, and rough Jing rice was at 6.90 yuan. Yesterday, the foreign rice market turned brisk due to inquiries from various regions, but there was not much high-quality rice on the market, and merchants uniformly raised prices. Foreign firms held back. Yesterday, Northern merchants purchased in the market, and the situation was particularly good. Subsequently, one lot of 700 bags of Saigon rice was sold, with the Northern merchants taking 500 bags and Fuzhou taking 200 bags, at a price of 8.45 yuan. This was a new shipment brought in by the Fuka Foreign Firm a month ago. Most of the market inventory is old rice, so the selling price was particularly good.</p>
<h3 id="e259">Lending of Wheat and Wheat Attacks on Trademarked Flour Wheat <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>The flour market has gradually weakened since opening this morning, with a downward trend and a bleak outlook. The closing prices were down by 0.025 yuan for November, down by 0.027 yuan each for June and October, down by 0.0175 yuan for July, down by 0.015 yuan for September, and down by 0.0125 yuan for August. There are many reasons for the market decline, the most important being the U.S. lending wheat in large amounts and the new wheat entering the market. The new wheat is good everywhere. Arrivals have been continuous in the Nanjing area, and other places should also see a consistent market within this ten-day period. Traders from the production areas are strongly disposing of goods in view of the situation of foreign wheat. Foreign wheat futures also fell by 0.02-0.03 yuan, and there is talk of a scheduled shipment of large quantities of borrowed wheat, so hoarding and reselling, speculation, and cautious sales are prevailing, and factory dumping is particularly intense. The market is falling again and again and cannot be sustained.</p>
<p>The wheat market continues to decline because foreign wheat telegrams are down by 0.02-0.03 yuan. Borrowed wheat is scheduled to arrive in China, and new and old wheat are gradually arriving in Shanghai. The new wheat harvest is very good, and large quantities are arriving in Shanghai from various places, so the market sentiment is very weak. Traders and brokers are strongly hedging, and prices are falling uniformly for all months. The closing prices were down by 0.05 yuan for July, down by 0.06 yuan each for August and September, down by 0.04 yuan for October, and down by 0.06 yuan for November. New wheat also arrived in the Pudong area, with 325 bags priced at 4 yuan, which was purchased by the Shanghai factory. Because there were not many arrivals and the quality was good, it was traded at the railway station.</p>

<p>After the early small harvest this year, few shipments have arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday, 83 bags of new small-grain broad beans from Hankou arrived in the market. The quality was still good, with an opening price of 3.75 yuan. However, the future market is unlikely to be stable due to weak demand. New rapeseed from Jiujiang, which arrived yesterday, also went on sale, with a price of 6.35 yuan. 80 bags of new Wuhu cowpeas were sold to foreign firms at prices above 7 yuan. Qing broad beans from Minhang are in short supply due to limited sources, and the market was firm this morning. 400 bags of Ningbo broad beans continued to arrive, and were sold at 5.40 yuan, continuing to be purchased by the Fuzhou group.</p>
<h3 id="e261">Sugar Market: Coarse Sand, White Lotus, and Red Sugar All Rebound Slightly <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market initially rose and then fell with the gold standard. The Lotus exchange rate rose slightly, and the trend showed weakness. The association set a price of 20.28 yuan for ordinary grade No. 24 coarse sand white, with several hundred bags traded, down by 0.02 yuan from the previous day. There were no transactions for No. 20 medium sand white. No. 8-9 Lotus Red KNG brand had some movement at 16.15 yuan, down by 0.05 yuan from the previous day. Changxing firm opened with Guanghua factory Lu Zi brand at 10.06 yuan, Shou Zi brand at 10 yuan, ground sand with Guang bag at 10.08 yuan, and RA cotton Lotus White at 10.4 yuan. Zhenji also opened with a batch of cotton white, with No. 1 at 19.75 yuan, No. 2 at 0.55 yuan, No. 3 at 0.35 yuan, No. 4 at 0.15 yuan, and Nos. 5 and 6 below a few jiao, with sales weak. During this summer season, there is considerable demand for cotton sugar from various regions, so sales are not weak. A Chaozhou group opened with dozens of bags of Chongti Zhuangqing at 12.7 yuan. Hainan red sugar opened with 50 bags at 13.75 yuan. Guangdong group merchants opened with more than 100 bags of Huizhou white at 18.6 yuan. The square merchant wanted 3.4 yuan for full grade white sugar, and the trade merchant offered 0.2 yuan, but no transaction occurred.</p>

<p>— Geng</p>
<p>This is probably something everyone would like to hear: the Chinese government will have a large income, namely the 50 million U.S. dollars that Finance Minister Song signed for from the U.S. Reconstruction Finance Corporation.</p>
<p>The story is that Song borrowed this huge sum from the U.S. on the condition that American cotton and wheat be purchased on the spot to alleviate our cotton and wheat shortages. It is believed that this loan will benefit both parties, as it can promote the sale of surplus American products and encourage Chinese people to use American cotton and wheat. The repayment period is three years, with a 5% interest rate for extensions.</p>
<p>Our country is currently facing a severe financial crisis, scraping the bottom of the barrel. Has it received the grace of the U.S., a savior? And must it be converted into cotton and wheat on the spot? We, the common people who "have breakfast but no dinner" and "can cover our shame but not our bodies," how can we not be well-fed and sing with full bellies? However, it always feels like it's never easy to get involved with transactions with high-nosed, blue-eyed people. If you insist on getting involved, the result will definitely be like what the Ministry of Education approves: "always losing out." And after losing out, if the other party or a third party asks, you can only force a smile and repeatedly say, "Thank you, thank you, very good, very good!"</p>
<p>Take the flood relief wheat from a few years ago as an example. The initial huge figures of tens of thousands were enough to make some people rejoice, especially those disaster victims who were crying in agony. But what was the result? The loan became wheat, and the wheat became the loan again. From the West to the East, from Beijing and Shanghai to the inland, after these manipulations and magic, how much actual benefit did the disaster victims truly receive? But the status of debtor, regardless of whether you were a victim or not, all compatriots have already earned it effortlessly. Now, it's like dripping molten iron on raw flesh, adding another "50 million U.S. dollars." I fear that from now on, debt will be added to debt, interest will generate interest, and even unborn descendants will have to preemptively accept "working for others for free."</p>
<p>Taking a step back, last year's bumper harvest led to low grain prices harming farmers. The facts are clear. Where did the "wheat shortage" come from? Even the so-called "cotton shortage" has not been widely discussed. I still need to investigate.</p>

<h3 id="e266">The Evolution of "Long-Term" <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>An ancient proverb says: "When a sage appears, the Yellow River will run clear." Whether this is absurd or not, let's leave it aside for now. Let's talk about the current state of affairs, where "long-term" has emerged, and China is in great turmoil. Looking at past history and examining reality, there is not a single discrepancy, not a single deviation.</p>
<p>Since our Mr. Sun Yat-sen raised the banner of overthrowing the Qing Dynasty and called for revolution, if we extend our hand and count down our thumb one by one, it has been fully fifty years. During this period, there have been many disturbances, and the country has turned countless somersaults. But even now, everyone says that the revolution has not succeeded, except for the veterans who are already chanting scriptures and worshiping Buddha, cherishing the legacy of the past, and enjoying their peaceful lives.</p>
<p>This, I fear, is the origin of "long-term," or at least the author assumes so: the past has been fifty years, and no one can say how many years it will take for the revolution to truly succeed. Long-term, long-term, the Chinese revolution can be considered the number one long-term project.</p>
<p>Following the "long-term revolution," there has been a set of "long-term recuperation," roughly since the fifteenth and sixteenth years of the Republic. This prelude generally unfolds like this: Among important figures, differences in political views are inevitable. Once there are differences, there will inevitably be open and covert struggles. As a result, one side fails and the other side succeeds. The losers become disheartened, retire from politics, move far away to foreign lands, or retreat to seclusion, and invariably say, "long-term recuperation." In reality, what kind of tricks are played after this prelude can only be recalled by the reader from past objective facts.</p>
<p>"Long-term" ultimately has a source and is inherited. Seeing it, it has already been glorified with the times. The Japanese soldiers, regardless of the impropriety, started from the September 18th Incident the year before last, seized our Shenyang, and have been advancing steadily since then, then the entire province of Fengtian, then Heilongjiang, then the entire Northeast, then all the regions north of the Great Wall, and even Pingjin nearly faced a dangerous situation. Fortunately, our authorities have finally awakened, wagged their tails, and yielded. These days, it seems like the clouds have been parted and we can see the blue sky again, the wind is not too strong and the cranes are not crying, and the storm has not engulfed the entire city. However, our authorities do not yield at heart. "Long-term resistance," is this not the current great policy for resisting humiliation? From September 18th until now, and perhaps until the endless future, in every occasion, is it not the sound of "long-term," "long-term," "long-term resistance" filling our ears?</p>
<p>"Long-term" has already been greatly glorified by being applied to resistance to defend the country, and it seems that there is no more brilliant magic weapon. The reality is not so.</p>
<p>For several days, I have been running around outside. The first time, on North Sichuan Road, I encountered two children carrying a cloth banner advertisement as large as a national flag, parading in the street. The subtitle read:</p>
<p>×× Shoe Company</p>
<p>Long-Term Mega Sale</p>
<p>丨Opportunity Not to Be Missed丨</p>
<p>At that time, I looked at it again and again and felt that the phrase "Opportunity Not to Be Missed" was superfluous and actually contradicted the word "Long-Term." For several days, on Bazilu, outside of the Waituo Bridge, I encountered it twice again, and the phrase "Opportunity Not to Be Missed" was still there. I wanted to go up and offer advice, that even changing it to "Why not come?" would be better. But I deeply fear that those two children are unteachable, afraid of bad luck, and inviting trouble. I dare not, I dare not, so I just let it go.</p>
<p>From this, we can see that "long-term" is not only a great scripture for resisting humiliation and saving the country, but it has actually become a magic weapon for merchants to attract business. How it will evolve in the future is truly something that no one can predict.</p>
<p>Turning back to extensively checking Mr. Wang Yunwu's Great Dictionary and the Revised Edition of the Dictionary, neither has an annotation on the "long-term" great scripture, which is deeply regrettable. I hope lexicographers will have something to add to it in the future.</p>
<p>To bring the conversation back, since "long-term has emerged, China is in great turmoil," readers, please look at China today!</p>
<h3 id="e267">Two Trips to Wusong <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Shu</p>
<p>Even I find it strange. I've almost become accustomed to waking up early, but for some reason, today, when I was going to visit Wusong, I woke up especially late—I opened my eyes and it was already five minutes past seven. I jumped out of bed and heard the raindrops outside the window hitting the glass with a crisp sound.</p>
<p>Because I was one of the people responsible, even though we had an agreement that "it would be canceled if it rained," I felt it was still necessary to run to the station. So I quickly washed my face, made a phone call, and called for a car. Fortunately, I arrived at the station at 7:20, twenty minutes before the train was scheduled to leave. In the crowd, I happily found Cheng Yi and Hui Cheng, each carrying a basket of picnic snacks. I asked them, "Has everyone come?" They briefly answered, "Just the two of us."</p>
<p>"Go, go! We'll go even if we have only one companion, let alone now that we have three!" This was our common intention, so we walked into the carriage without hesitation.</p>
<p>As we walked onto the beach of Fort Baoshan, the raindrops became even more intense. Hui Cheng and I had hats, but Cheng Yi's head was bare, so I handed him my raincoat and told him to wear it on his head. So we continued walking, singing marching songs all the way to the end of Fort Baoshan.</p>
<p>The rain was attacking us non-stop, and the wind was also howling and roaring as if it was helping the evil.</p>
<p>Our thin clothes were soaked, our faces were covered with glistening water droplets, and our bodies felt a slight chill; but we didn't feel depressed, we absolutely didn't resent, curse, or hope, we just asked the heavens. We just felt, "Oh, how interesting!"</p>
<p>We wandered around in the wind and rain for a long time, and we took several photos of each other with mirror boxes. Our stomachs were rumbling, so we went to a small teahouse and took out bread and canned food to eat greedily.</p>
<p>At twelve o'clock, we had already walked onto the avenue from Fort Baoshan to Baoshan County. The sky was slowly clearing up, and the number of tourists on the road was gradually increasing. In fact, we didn't feel any pain or itching to whether the sky was clear or raining: the number of tourists did not affect our mood at all, because, you think, you close your eyes and quietly think about it, how beautiful is the seaside on a rainy day, and how poetic is it to stroll along the seaside in the rain! That's enough to satisfy people, how could we say we feel lonely or unhappy?</p>
<p>Because Cheng Yi still had some trivial matters to attend to, he suggested going home early, and we naturally agreed with him because we thought we had gotten reasonably fatigued. When we stepped back into Zhabei, it was already three o'clock.</p>
<p>On the way back and forth, on the train, we passed through the battlefield where the "January 28th" War took place a few years ago. There, broken walls and ruins were everywhere. We stretched our heads out to look, look, and look, we passed one place and then another, and we were all thinking, but we never learned the irrelevant lamentations of the literati, or imitated the unpromising sighs of the weak. We only thought this: The threat of imperialism to us will only increase our "anti-</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>Imperialist" sentiment and strengthen our "anti-Imperialist" determination! Besides, the gains of the imperialists are limited and superficial. Yes, at present, the only way out for our nation is to unite and fight on the organized "anti-Imperialist" battle line. What other way is there?</p>

<p>— Yi Li</p>
<p>"The long-nosed one is coming."</p>
<p>Whenever the principal came, we would always spread the word like this, not out of fear, but because we found it amusing.</p>
<p>The principal's nose was indeed very long, about an inch high and half a foot long, standing trembling in the air. Whenever he was furious with his subordinates, this nose would always vibrate strangely in the air, vibrating so much that you would sometimes be terrified, fearing that it would fall off.</p>
<p>When you meet him, the first thing that makes you recognize him is the length of his nose; then you notice his two thick lips twitching tightly, his words slurred and incomprehensible, and everything else.</p>
<p>Friends who came to the school to find us for the first time would always exclaim in surprise: "Your principal's nose is so long!"</p>
<p>Because the number of people who came to find us was large, the number of times we heard such words was also quite a lot, to the point that we were embarrassed and instead blamed the length of this nose for being a stain on the school. However, sometimes we would think, "Maybe our school will soon become famous because of this nose." Because our school, to tell the truth, is nothing special in the city. So we were very comforted, forgetting all the things that looked down on him, and even hoped that he would continue to sit in that chair and calculate the school accounts all day long.</p>
<h3 id="e269">Shop Assistant Communication: Break Time <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I am currently an apprentice in a money shop, and I only studied up to junior high school. My knowledge is shallow, and I am afraid that I will not be able to gain a foothold in society in the future, so I have obtained my parents' consent to attend Russian language classes at ×× night school. However, due to working hard all day long, coupled with mental state reasons, my body has deteriorated; whenever I read, I feel distracted, and after a while, I feel sleepy. After studying for several months, the result is equal to zero. I think that if this continues, it will not be a long-term solution.</p>
<p>I get up at six o'clock every day to practice calligraphy; I go to work at nine o'clock until four o'clock in the afternoon. I go to school to read at seven o'clock, and I can't return to the shop until 9:45. What time can I take a nap to make my energy strong in the evening? Or what kind of energizing medicine is there? The one that is cheap and works quickly is the most suitable. I hope the teacher can guide me! With this, I wish you peace, student Qian Qingshi respectfully.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: An adult needs about eight hours of sleep every day. If he has eight hours of sleep and still feels unenergized, then there must be other reasons, not because he sleeps too little. Now, Mr. Qian gets up at six o'clock every day and, if he goes to bed immediately after 9:45 in the evening, then he still has eight hours of sleep; logically, it is enough. However, when you are in bed between ten o'clock and six o'clock, you should dispel all distracting thoughts: be sure not to let the imagination run wild. So we cannot agree that you want to find a time to sleep briefly during the day. This is not only unnecessary, but also impossible in reality—too early is unnecessary; too late will lead to insomnia at night: and what would it be like for a person with a job to sleep during the day?</p>
<p>We advise you to have appropriate exercise between 6:00 AM and 9:00 AM, or between 4:00 PM and 7:00 PM. When we are doing things in the writing room, the brain is working, and the limbs are almost completely resting. When we exercise, the opposite is true. The limbs are fully exercised, and the brain rests completely. This way, during the day, the brain and limbs take turns resting; then, with eight hours of sleep at night, your energy will definitely be strong. As for energizing drugs, we dare not introduce them. A person without illness does not need to take medicine; and most energizing drugs contain stimulants, which are harmful if used for a long time. If you do not have symptoms of illness, we advise you not to try them; even if you feel that you already have symptoms of illness and have to resort to medicine, you must ask a doctor for diagnosis. For "patent medicines" in pharmacies, it is best not to take them.</p>

<h3 id="e271">The Life of the Fifth Consort (Continuation 27) <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Twenty-five, 250 yuan</p>
<p>Everyone needs a way to pass the time. Since the young master was no longer as clingy as before, the Fifth Consort's only pastime was reading "Dream of the Red Chamber." Like every young lady, the Fifth Consort hoped to win the favor of the handsome Baoyu, but she did not agree with Daiyu's hopeless weeping. However, she admired Wang Xifeng's character very much. But she was ashamed; could she really be as shrewd and capable as Sister Feng? In the end, she had no full confidence. Thinking of this, she gently put down the book and stared blankly out the window. Then, she picked up Zhang Wenbin's photo from beside her pillow and sighed heavily.</p>
<p>An old maid came in with a piece of paper, saying that there was a car waiting outside. The Fifth Consort took the paper and saw that it was a car sent by the Second Consort to pick her up for mahjong. She thought, "This is a great opportunity to get to know the Second Consort." So she immediately dressed up, left at once, got into the car, and drove off.</p>
<p>As the driver drove up to the Second Consort's house, he honked the horn several times. An inspector immediately opened the iron gate to welcome them, driving all the way to the front of the stone steps to stop. The Fifth Consort got out of the car in her cloak, and a maid immediately came forward to serve her. Walking into the Second Consort's bedroom, she saw women she had never seen before. But she was very smart, knowing that the one whose Mandarin was not very pure was the Second Consort, even though she was completely dressed as a Chinese wife. Then, through the Second Consort's introduction, she learned that the two young ladies were the eldest and second Misses who had just come from Beijing. Naturally, these two young ladies were very decent, especially the eldest Miss, whose short hair covering her forehead was even more charming, but the second Miss, holding a pair of all-white kittens in her hands, was also very docile and cute.</p>
<p>Everyone exchanged pleasantries while cracking melon seeds and puffing on cigarettes. Soon, they moved to the outer room and sat down at the mahjong table. The surface of the sandalwood table was covered with a silk tablecloth, nothing special, but the mahjong set with green jade inlaid on the outside was something the Fifth Consort's family did not have. Thinking carefully about it, she couldn't help but feel ashamed.</p>
<p>After a game of mahjong, probably because she was out of luck, the Fifth Consort lost more than two hundred and fifty yuan. However, the Fifth Consort knew that if she hadn't intentionally let the Second Consort, who was her next player, eat a few more tiles, the Second Consort would have had no way to win money. Moreover, after a game of mahjong, the Second Consort actually became very close to her. How could this be bought with a hundred or two hundred yuan? What did a mere two hundred and fifty yuan amount to? Therefore, even though our Fifth Consort lost money, she still smiled and talked generously.</p>
<p>At the dinner table, Minister Su was very happy because they could be so harmonious, and furthermore,</p>
<p>After dinner, the Second Consort insisted that he personally send the Fifth Consort back, so he felt even more that his good fortune was not small.</p>

<h3 id="e272">The Making of the Horror Film "King Kong" <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Fen</p>
<p>Unmasking the Western Mirror - So It Is!</p>
<p>In the film industry of 1933, many horror films have appeared. The most terrifying of these is "King Kong" from RKO Pictures. Hollywood's film industry believes that "King Kong" is the most terrifying work in horror films, enough to overwhelm all "Dragon Tiger Fight," "The Lost World," "The Old Dark House," "Frankenstein," etc. But how was this film made? For example, a very large ape, as tall as the sky, killed many people, and even took a woman away (played by the actress Fay Wray). Later, many methods were used to kill this giant ape and save the woman's life. When the giant ape climbed to the top of the highest building in New York, many planes were used to bomb it, and even one plane was destroyed by the giant ape. How was such a giant ape filmed?</p>
<p>The filming of "King Kong" is completely fake. It relies on the skills of the cinematographer and set designer, using complex composite photography to piece together several scenes. It also relies on the use of light, without revealing any flaws. The audience will never feel that this film is fake. The technical ingenuity is enough to be called a masterpiece of filming techniques in 1933.</p>
<p>In the key scene of "King Kong," the giant ape climbs to the top of a tall building in New York, holding the woman in its palm. Planes bomb it in the sky. This scene was filmed using seven pieces of film spliced together. First, the scenery of the New York sky was filmed on a high building in New York, with all the high rooftops in the film. Second, the situation of the planes flying in the sky was filmed. Then, the first and second films were spliced together and re-filmed into one film. Third, the huge ape was filmed. A very small model ape was used, and then it was spliced together with the first composite film. Finally, a side view of a woman lying down was filmed, and then matched with the second composite film. In this way, one layer upon another, a total of seven films were used, and four composite re-filming procedures were spent. As long as the effort is deep enough, an iron ruler can be ground into a needle. The effort is naturally not small, but the results cannot be said to be not great.</p>
<p>In addition to the giant ape, there are also four kinds of monsters, unusually ferocious, the most terrifying animals in the ancient world, which were also filmed using models, spliced and re-filmed with other real-life films. Although "King Kong" has no meaning at all, its filming work is enough to open a new era in the art world.</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3 id="e273">Review of "Innocence" <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— Bacon</p>
<p>Because it focuses on elaborating on innocence, a modern dancer does not love the warlord/division commander who is rich and round-faced but accepts the diligence of a small mustache and still remembers her old love for the painter. Such an innocent dancer cannot be found in today's society. And the secondary important character in this theme, the painter, is also extremely stubborn and simple. This film tries its best to think from the opposite side, but it can't find anything commendable, while the various dark secrets of society, such as prostitution, assassination, and the temptation of money and flesh, are performed vividly.</p>
<p>The expressions of the actors are just so-so for the protagonist, and the rest are even more mediocre.</p>
<p>The identity of the dance hall manager doesn't seem to require showing off humor. Turning a somersault when kicking guests out is even more abrupt. Such an interlude is counterproductive. The facial makeup of several gamblers has many flaws. The dance hall manager seems to be tailing, and then he goes to the Wei family to mediate, which leads to the dancer's origins very unnaturally. The division commander bribes the foster father and secretly enters the dancer's bedroom, and is assassinated. It only takes one knife, which seems insufficient. The dancer is stabbed, and at least there should be a cry for help. Wouldn't people only a door away hear it? Furthermore, she is stabbed and falls outside the door, which seems to be the door of the dance hall, but in the end, she is picked up by a drunk, which doesn't seem like the door of the dance hall. This location is somewhat vague. What is the point of the painter carrying a portrait and running around? It is also inexplicable.</p>
<h3 id="e274">Talking About "Innocence" <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Jiaqing</p>
<p>"Innocence" is such a "noble" and "honorable" word. This is a production of the fourth factory of Lianhua. The general idea of this film is about a poor painter who falls in love with a lonely woman. She is taken care of by a gambling addict, who is outwardly her father, but in reality, she is his "slave" and his "source of income" because he is forced to take his daughter to be a dancer due to cheating in the gambling hall. Because she is too popular, a jealous incident occurs. When the poor painter finds out about this incident, he breaks up with her, ridicules her, and says she is not "innocent" or "pure," but until her death, she remains "innocent" and "pure."</p>
<p>The plot is very ordinary, without any instruction, and the director has no special skills. There are many minor flaws. The photography lighting is blurry in several places, and the scenery is also very simple.</p>
<p>The actors, such as Yin Mingzhu, perform well, but playing a seventeen or eighteen-year-old young girl seems too inappropriate for her status. Luo Keming's expressions are good in the first half, but lacking in facial expressions in the second half. Wei Guang is too much, and Han Langen's humor is somewhat contrived. The rest have no special features, and the actors are all mediocre.</p>
<h3 id="e275">Impressions After Watching "Innocence" <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Bin</p>
<p>The theme of this film is somewhat elusive. Although it is named "Innocence," after watching it, one cannot help but feel that it is not "clear" and not "white."</p>
<p>The subtitles tell the audience: "Pipa is a good woman, she is willing to work, but not willing to be a dancing girl embraced by the public." But I see her performance on the screen seems to be greatly contrary to her ambition, isn't that a noteworthy loophole?</p>
<p>The painter Xiao originally loved Pipa very much, but later he learned that she was imprisoned! When he saw Pipa, he not only did not comfort her, but actually blamed her indiscriminately. Is this also for the sake of loving her?</p>
<p>As for the expressions of the actors, Ms. Yin Mingzhu performs best, but there is one thing, Ms. Yin's youth has passed with time. In this film, it seems that she is not suitable for the role of the young girl, Pipa, but it is to her credit that she can fully describe the naivety and vitality of the young girl. The rest, such as Min De Zhang, are very successful, Luo Kepeng is just so-so, and Han Langen is somewhat overly humorous!</p>
<p>In short, the plot of this film has failed, the expressions of the actors are commendable, and the director's skills are also worthy of admiration.</p>
<h3 id="e276">After Watching "Innocence" <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— Ya Hua</p>
<p>"Innocence" is directed by Dan Duyu, and he is indeed very capable of using his talent to unfold each scene very actively, making the audience feel satisfied. However, the pacing is too fast and superficial, and the lighting is also somewhat stagnant.</p>
<p>Due to the unsound structure of the script of "Innocence" and those unnecessary forced insertions, the audience cannot feel tension and cannot get a deep impression.</p>
<p>The screenwriter of "Innocence" wanted to write the (Pipa) in the play as a poor girl, so at the beginning of the film, it is written that eighteen years ago, Pipa was still in swaddling clothes, and her father was imprisoned, so he entrusted Pipa to Wei Guang as a foster daughter. Wei Guang is a gambling and brutal man, so Pipa's situation is naturally very miserable.</p>
<p>Yin Mingzhu, who plays Pipa, has not seen vitality in the action of playing a young girl, but the later dance girl is very good. Pipa's lover, the painter Xiao (played by Luo Keming), performs very ordinarily. Because his performance is ordinary, and the script is scattered, the drama's "focus of love" could not be fully performed. Since the center of gravity of the whole play is lost, each scene after that cannot be natural.</p>
<p>The section where Pipa is lured to the Western Hotel by Ma Shichang is filmed very well, but Pipa's dancing appearance kills Ma Shichang out of jealousy, because it does not clearly write out how passionately Wuyong is in love with Pipa, so it feels abrupt, and the audience does not know why the dancing appearance wants to kill Ma Shichang.</p>
<p>The plot originally wanted to write that Pipa was still chaste until her death, but the screen did not clearly write it out, so the audience only felt that her death was unfortunate and did not have some pity.</p>
<p>In short, Dan Jun's use of photography skills, scenery, and many small movements are worthy of appreciation, but it is a pity that it failed in the script.</p>
<h3 id="e277">Tianyi's Two "Trilogies" <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Yang</p>
<p>Tianyi Film Company has recently been actively transforming. In the future, its productions will completely abandon the love themes of "Pursuit" and "The Lost Orchid Valley," and resolutely embark on the path needed by movie audiences, striving for "anti-feudal" and "anti-imperial" performances. It particularly focuses on the future of Chinese women and the exposure of the lives of the working masses.</p>
<p>Tianyi is currently working hard on two "trilogies"丨丨 (1) "Dusk," "Dawn," "Vitality" (2) "Dead End," "Bloody Road," "Living Road." This news should make us somewhat happy, because it clearly shows that the transformation of Tianyi Company is an entire great transformation, and it is courageously advancing towards the path of true film art.</p>
<p>It is heard that "Dusk" and "Dawn" are being filmed, and "Vitality" has been released in the capital and will return to Shanghai soon. In this film, director Shao Zuiweng, protagonist Chen Yumei, and supporting actors Yuan Meiyun, Lu Lixia, Xiao Zhengzhong, Zhang Zhenduo, etc., are all performing a new technique. Some people say, "The leading actress Chen Yumei has never worked so hard before. Here, she has used all her current strength." This film is definitely worth our attention. The theme of "Vitality" is: A woman is married to a bourgeois husband, and usually suffers all kinds of anger and humiliation from that man, so she realizes the path she should take. She finally unites with the women of the working class, jumps out of the golden dream's bed, and advances to the road of "vitality." Detailed content has been published in the issue of this publication on April 25.</p>

<p>The leading actress in "Cleopatra," Ms. Claudette Colbert, is only five feet five inches tall and weighs one hundred and three pounds. It can be said that she is a petite and exquisite girl. Who would believe that she is proficient in boxing? But one day, she played a shrew in (I Cover the Waterfront) and had to fight the other party. The director ordered Claudette to treat the other party very rudely. Claudette said, "I don't want to really hit her. I'm afraid it will be too realistic."</p>
<p>The director looked at her and said, "Don't worry. Even if you hit harder, you won't hurt her." Claudette smiled and prepared to fight.</p>
<p>"Camera! Action!" shouted a voice. Claudette saw the other party running over, and calmly aimed at her face and punched her hard. The other party fell to the ground and was injured. It took more than ten minutes to wake her up.</p>
<p>"Good friend, do you really hate me so much?"</p>

<p>— Xin Fu</p>
<p>Produced by German Film Company, starring a joint cast of female actors</p>
<p>"One, two, three, turn left! One, two, three, turn left and walk! What is this? It turns out that the students are lining up, waiting for the principal's speech! In the center of the auditorium, there is a lecture platform. Hundreds of students are arranged in a semicircular formation in front of the lecture platform. Several slave-like teachers also stood on both sides. After a while, the self-proclaimed female principal, wearing glasses with lenses, and holding a cane, walked step by step onto the lecture platform. As usual, she ordered the students to sing a sunflower poem song first, and then began her speech. But talking about it, it's just the old clichés of "obeying discipline" and "obeying orders." Recently, she probably found some private letters in the school! So in the end, she said with force! "Whether it is sending out or receiving letters, they must follow the law, otherwise they will be severely punished." Manny Nella saw the principal's attitude in the crowd, and couldn't help but feel chills again.</p>
<p>"This child is so pitiful, she doesn't have a mother. I see that she's been frowning all day long since she came here." A maid of Pei's was cleaning her room, while muttering to herself. "Who are you talking about," Pei asked, "isn't it that Miss Mannella!" the maid replied. Pei Bai heard this and paused for a while. Then she said to the maid! "Go find her, I have something to say to her." The maid agreed and went away with a limp.</p>
<p>After a while, Manny Nella really followed the maid in. Pei Bai was originally sitting there looking at the coupons. When she saw Manny Nella, she stood up with a smile and walked to Manny's side. She shook Manny's hand and said, "Mannella, are you not used to anything when you first came here? But it will be better after staying for a while. You have to be happy, don't be pessimistic! Promise me"? To Manny Nella, who has not enjoyed the love of her mother for many years; to a girl who is pursuing love, in such an unfamiliar place with no relatives, how could these words not hit her heart! So she was grateful, she shed tears, and finally she lay on Pei Bai's arm and cried bitterly!</p>
<p>Dang! Dang! Dang! The bedtime bell rang! The students put on their nightgowns one by one and walked to the bedside. Ms. Pei Bai walked into the room under her jurisdiction, turned off the lights first. Then she said to everyone, "Be quiet, I'll give you that good-night kiss!" The many students squatted on the edge of the bed, holding the bed railing with both hands, as if young birds were waiting for old birds to feed them, raising their heads, waiting for Pei Bai to give them a kiss. The last one was Manny Nella! Her heart suddenly became excited; her enthusiasm was boiling in her chest; her tired autumn waves shot straight at Pei Bai. She couldn't help but hug Pei Bai, and put her mouth against Pei Bai's mouth, kissing it hard, before falling asleep quietly. (To be continued)</p>
