<p>時評</p>
<h3>國人應知自重</h3>
<p>梓·</p>
<p>半月來有前大總統徐世昌密赴東北之謠。後經事實證明。徐氏仍在天津度其書畫自娱之生活。謠乃不關自息。北方報紙。有借此著論。表揚徐氏自愛愛國之言行。以恚年來拼命内閧之巨人及政治慾太熾之軍人策士。吾人則以爲年齡環境如徐氏者能。自愛即巳足。而對於血氣方剛懷才自炫之人。應責以自重。蓋自愛者潔身自好之謂。非所語於鬱勃思動恃才欲試之中年人。而自重之義。爲尊重己身之人格。則足以範圍政治活動者之行爲。使勿入於危害國家之歧途也。數年以來因政治關係。而鬱勃思動恃才欲試者頗不乏人。此等人責以潔身自好。不特言不入耳。且與其修養之程度。相去過遠。告以尊重己身人格。或稍可以節制其行爲耳。</p>
<p>吾人就事實以言。國難縱極嚴重。苟未至政臻上治。天下翕然。自難使國内政治活動。完全絕滅。如欲强求。亦祇徒勞而已。然在另一方面。從事政治活動之人。必須自檢其人格。在今日薄氷深淵之環境中。行動稍失準繩。即於無意中受敵人之利用。以增加國家之危險。同時其自身之人格。亦將隨而發生問題馮玉祥懸崖勒馬。中止其局部行動。倐然赴魯休養。其亦懷於此義而有所覺悟矣乎。</p>
<p>推此義而縱論之。則自重之說。尚有其可以應用之方面焉。最近密勒氏評論報東京通訊。述日人僞親善之言論數種。其主張爲亞洲故與中國親善。狂呼不使中國爲外力所侵入。似稍知彼邦東亞孟羅主義之内容者。不難立見其用意。其較具誘惑性者。如恊助鞏固中國之議。一紙兩面之喻。有力政府之說。則固懇而談。深藏其作用於創言立說以外也。然在事實上。中國如有一鞏固之政府。以統治廣大之領域繁庶之人民。必成一較日本更有力量之世界大國。此豈以亞洲盟主自居之日本所願者。吾人於此。可以明瞭日人甘言中之惡意有識之士。自無有誤信其言而入其　中者。有之必致誤已以誤國。此所以貴自重也。</p>

<h3>馮玉祥離察過平南下</h3>
<p>瑾</p>
<p>離張垣前公祭抗日烈士</p>
<p>宋哲元等　至豐台始别</p>
<p>到魯後生活費宋韓分擔</p>
<p>北平特訊、此次馮玉祥離開張垣、所以具此决心者、固因環境困難、不得不然、一方亦以考慮結果、如仍留張垣或張垣以北、則某種不幸情形、必然發現、宋哲元調停方法、屆時必亦窮盡、而馮自料此種不幸情形發生以後、無論就何方面言、於國家·朋友·本身、均絕對有害、當馮表示决心南行時、部下之激烈分子、曾痛哭失聲、堅切挽留、謂馮不應將此基本的革命武力、輕輕放棄、及見馮無可挽回、彼等乃不復力爭、現在原隸馮之部隊、已完全離開張垣、彼等現駐地點、（甲）方振武駐萬全、張北、（乙）孫良誠駐商都、（丙）吉鴻昌駐多倫·沽源、（丁）檀自新李忠義張礪生支應遴均駐張北、（戊）劉桂堂駐赤城·龍關、就中方振武軍之張人傑部、已由軍分會收編、計共一師、（三團制）業無問題、方氏本人、現居萬全、北平軍事當局、十四日晨特派代表赴萬全促方來平、任軍分會委員、聞方與某當局平日私交尙稱不惡、雖未必即能應召、但或可相當就範、其餘如孫良誠部、亦可容易商量、所最困難者、惟吉鴻昌等部、中央現雖責成宋哲元負責收拾、但其中難題甚多、一時恐尚不易解决、故察事糾紛、馮去雖可告一段落、然尚不能遽認即可從此完全無事也、馮此次毅然南下、對於一年來在張垣所經營之武力、將完全消滅、但中央方面、當然可增進若干好感、其不使調人如宋哲元韓復榘等從中爲難、尤使宋韓今後對馮出處、不得不從旁設法、故馮到泰山後、中央將有相當名義、使馮不致完全投閒置散、至馮是否願就、則又另一問題耳、茲紀馮氏離察經過如次、</p>
<h3>離張經過</h3>
<p>馮氏麻電發表後、魯主席韓復榘曾電馮歡迎赴泰山居住、馮因候晤宋哲元、且個人原擬暫居張北、不欲離察、故一時無所表示、嗣因中央及北平方面、一再電馮請即離察南下、俾宋哲元得以返察、自由處理察省軍政、宋亦恐馮居張北、易爲人挾持利用、故於十二日抵張家口、馮　　下接第十三版</p>

<p>善後、其餘人員、一律離開張垣、是日、馮乃電韓、通知起程日期、韓覆電稱準於十四日晨派鐵甲車北上、至豐台迎接、馮接電後、遂决定十四日晨起程、馮起程之前一日、馮部將領吉鴻昌孫良誠等、均到新村謁馮話别、溯馮於五月二十六日就抗日同盟軍職起、迄八月十四日止、適爲九九之數、此一幕劇、於以告終、</p>

<p>工足三陽等十廠</p>
<h3>作僞心勞日拙</h3>
<p>私進劣貨變造稅單眞相</p>
<p>新聲社云、本埠工足襪廠·三陽棉織廠·久益織廠·鼎新布廠·等十家、最近因購用日貨、變造申新第五紗廠稅單事、業經申新紗廠向第一特區地方法院提起刑訴、該案眞相、茲經調查如下、</p>
<h3>劣貨價廉</h3>
<p>自九一八後、市面劣貨、因受抵制影響、削價偷售、即以紗線一項而論、劣貨市價、較國貨市價、每件往往便宜至二三十元以上、以故本埠各棉織廠、暗中私進劣貨者、仍所不免、惟紗線織成品物、無論是否國貨、已無從辨别、但於出品送往財政部統稅局執運時、依照手續、須將所進原料之稅單同時呈騐、私進劣貨諸廠商、爲避免社會注意起見、均將稅單私行塗改爲中國各紗廠廠名、其塗改方法、係用一種藥水、在紙上稍加擦洗、即可將字跡洗去、故兩年來統稅局受人朦混過去者、紗線已不下數萬件、價値當在千萬元以上、</p>
<h3>塗改稅單</h3>
<p>最近有工足三陽等廠、仍以前項塗改稅單、向蘇浙皖統稅局報運、不料被局方察破、係以日商大康紗廠之稅單塗改爲申新第五紗廠之稅單、不但塗改字跡顯然、而最足使人辨認者、厥爲稅單上統稅局辦事處印章之不符、其故因統稅局、均派有專員、駐在各紗廠徵收紗稅、徵過者均發有稅單、稅單上即鈐以辦事員之印章、此次發覺之假稅單、其單上所鈐印章之辦事員、係統稅局派、駐大康紗廠、而並非申新五廠者、故是項稅單之爲變造、巳無疑問、</p>
<h3>稅局根究</h3>
<p>自統稅局發覺後、即召集工足三陽等十廠經理訊問、各廠以證據確鑿、無可抵賴、局方除將該案經過情形、呈報統稅署核辦外、並一面通知申新五廠依法起訴、茲將其公函三件錄下、（一）案據三陽·工足·永源·久益·各織廠、繳騐申新五廠棉紗完稅照七紙來局、請印發運照、檢騐所繳完稅照、照面廠名牌名、均有塗改痕跡、自應切實根究、照章罰辦、茲定於八月一日下午三時開會審查、除通知各該廠遣派負責代表屆時來局陳述理由外、相應函達貴紗廠查照、即希遣派代表、屆時來局參加審查、陳述意見、幸勿延誤爲荷、（二）案查三陽等八家單純織廠塗改完稅照廠名牌一案、前據貴廠代表胡慶昇·榮華臣·來局聲稱申新五廠對於各該織廠塗改稅照行爲、認爲妨害營業、擬即依法起訴等語、除違反統稅章程部分、已由本局擬議、呈請稅務署核示辦理外、合將該塗改稅照各織廠廠名地址曁稅照號數開單、送請貴廠查照、（淸單略）（三）逕啓者、審查三陽等八家單純織廠、持用塗改完稅照一案、茲經開會審查、業將各該廠廠名稅照號數、開單送請查照在案、茲續據均昌灜洲兩染織廠繳納完稅照兩張、查核均係以大康廠立馬牌細紗五包稅照、改爲申新五廠人鐘牌字様、與前案情形相同、自應照案辦理、除將所送稅照扣留外、相應開單函送貴紗廠查照、此致申新第五紗廠、</p>

<p>培昌並非培錫</p>
<p>培昌鐵號昨致本報函云、逕啟者、閱本月十三日貴報本埠新聞銅鐵機器業公會發表提倡國鐵談話一則、談話内容、爲提倡銷售六河溝國産生鐵、與年來敝號之推銷六河溝生鐵、同一見解、所稱日鐵傾銷、奸商操縱、度係别有所指、惟此談話之由來、則貴報載明因血魂除奸團指培昌須泰兩鐵行、私販日鐵、有函質問而發、培昌自問愛國未必後人、今以私販日鐵、登諸報紙、所稱雖屬空言、而因此誤會、要所難免、自不得不將培昌之銷鐵實况、請貴報一爲揭載、以明黑白、查自九一八事件發生以後、凡屬國人、設非喪心病狂、孰願與日人合作、培昌所銷生鐵、一爲六河溝之國産、一爲英商錦隆洋行所經售之印度産、而所願專銷者、則爲六河溝國産生鐵、是以六河溝啟爐、卽定貨一千噸、次定五千噸、復次六百噸、復次二百噸、復次二千六百噸、復次三千噸、口頭原有九月底以前一家專銷之約、事實上、中途銷與别方者、爲數亦鉅、故培昌僅得一萬二千噸、至英商錦隆洋行之印度生鐵、培昌銷數頗小、然該鐵不獨非日貨、亦非日商經銷、此可就本月四日上海市銅鐵機器業公會所登啟事之後段、與本月五日英商錦隆洋行之啟事、參閱而知者也、綜之、培昌提倡國貨最早、抵制日貨最堅、而謂於國家危急之秋、私販日貨、冤誣太甚、旣私販日貨之說、播傳報紙、則事實眞相、亦不得不求同一報纸之登明、用是臚舉上陳情形、敬請貴報登人來函、庶培昌之信譽營業、不致無端受損、實所厚幸、再貴報本月十四日送登銅鐵機器業公會查獲培昌廠仇貨一則、所謂培昌廠、與敝培昌鐵行、並非一家、且該廠圖記係培　字様、恐被淆混、合併聲明、此上申報館申北培昌鐵號謹啟、中華民國二十二年八月十六日、</p>

<h3>天廚損機解决經過</h3>
<p>原機修理並更換推進器等件</p>
<p>另贈之敎綀機則捐送飛行社</p>
<p>中央社云、天廚味精廠獨捐之全金屬戰鬥機一架、係向德國容克斯廠訂購、乃於抵滬後、尚未交貨之前、爲賣方所雇德駕駛員、於試飛時損壞、經天廚廠迭次向賣方交涉、另換新機、而賣方祇肯負責修理、相持不决者已將一月、日前天廚廠請求航空當局、派遣高級專員、詳加檢查損壞程度、以定交涉方針、當由中央航空學校校長毛邦初、委派廠長王伯修來滬、恊助交涉、王氏由杭乘飛機來滬、在虹橋降落後、即作長時間之檢查、其結果認爲該機因品質堅强、故重要部份、如發動機等、均未受損、乃召集天廚廠及容克斯廠之代表禪臣洋行、提出解决辦法、由賣方負責修理、至損壞部份、如推進器機輪及油箱等、則須配換新件、換就後、仍按照原合同、履行試飛手續、然後正式交貨、天廚廠以祇須換就後、一切標準、能與原定者符合、則此項辦法、亦屬合理、嗣對於已付貨欵之利息、及遲延交貨之損失問題、討論頗久、天廚廠之意、此種要求、雖依理提出、然對於捐輸之欵、却不願收回一部份、故須容克斯廠别謀一較有益於中國航空界之辦法、嗣又由王廠長提議、由容克斯廠將現在運華求售之全金屬Ａ五○式八十匹馬力敎練機一架、無代價交付與天廚廠、禪臣洋行因該機價値八千美金之巨、未便承認、經王廠長以顧全邦交、及商業信用相勗、又往復與容克斯廠電商、始行决定、惟對裝配試飛、不願再負全責、要求天廚廠方、於訂立合同時、書明由受方負責、當經王廠長慨允相助、故相持一月之交涉、始行解决、合同即將於一二日内訂定、現戰鬥機應換之件、巳電德赶運來華、至該廠敎練機、原向華北當局兜售、故現原箱存儲北平、廠方即將備函請求航空學校、將派員赴平裝妥、駛飛上海、並聞天廚廠擬將此項敎練機、贈送中國航空恊會附設之飛行社、作爲訓練航空專才之用、按此次交涉、天廚廠認定非一廠的關係、故絕不退讓、而賣方損失過鉅、自不欲輕率承認、雙方意見頗不易接近、乃因王廠長以極懇切之態度、提出極合理之辦法、故得此圓滿結果、實出初料之外、而天廚廠之始終以國家利益爲前提、及賣方之力顧信用、均屬不可及云、</p>

<h3>在大埔撞沉四鹽船</h3>
<p>鹽部紛起索賠</p>
<p>北晋巳被扣留</p>
<p>直東公司之北晉號輪、此次由華北運煤至海州大埔、停在港内碼頭起卸、適逢大潮、船身被衝至港中心、致同華被其斷練失錨、鄭州輪亦遭冲離碼頭、在港内之鹽船四艘、悉被撞沉、損失頗鉅、致北晉輪被當地鹽坨扣留、發生重大交涉、茲將情形查誌如下、</p>
<h3>北晉遇潮肇禍</h3>
<p>直東公司之北晉輪、在本月十一日、由華北運煤至海州、至大埔港内起卸、北晉輪停在大埔港内第一個碼頭上、而招商局之同華輪、泊在第二個碼頭、在同華之次、則爲合衆之鄭州輪、大埔潮水甚激、一來即漲三尺、爲航輪所畏懼、當時大潮陡增、北晉之船身、受激潮衝盪、前身即横開、苟當時將後尾纜砍斷、則可不致肇禍、但北晉尾纜未砍斷、其後尾乃向同華撞來、同華被撞、船亦離開碼頭、北晉船尾又將碼頭椿撞毁、同華後船尾、同遭擱淺、頭部所抛之兩錨練、盡被砌斷兩支、大錨完全失落港中、合衆之鄭州輪、亦受其震盪、横入港中、一時大埔港中、頓成紛亂不安之狀態、</p>
<h3>鹽船四艘覆沒</h3>
<p>在第三號碼頭之外擋、均停泊載鹽之民船、備駁上各輪而運赴長江各地者、北晉輪經激潮打至港心時、在碼頭之各輪、亦聯帶受其波害、紛離碼頭、港内之水、旣受潮漲之激力、復受各輪之震動、港水頓起旋轉、一時兎起　落、上下顚騰、而在北晉外擋之裝鹽民船四艘經北晉之甩撃、四鹽船全數覆滅、船上裝運之鹽、有數千包完全翻落港中、民船之舟子、亦悉行跌落港中、幸即救起、但鹽則全行沉失無存、損害至爲巨大、</p>
<h3>鹽商扣船交涉</h3>
<p>此事發生後、沉鹽之民船舟子、以北晉所肇禍、當向貨主報告、要求北晉輪賠償損失、而被撞壞之碼頭、亦向北晉交涉、須予修理、鹽商方面、以四船之鹽、成本甚巨、落水以後、便爾溶化、已全部犧牲、須歸肇禍之船負責、當塲報請大埔警察、將北晉輪扣留、不許開行出港、須俟撞沉鹽船問題、交涉得有結果、始可釋放、現此事已經與直東公司提出嚴重交涉、</p>
<h3>招商責撈錨練</h3>
<p>同華輪爲北晉撞斷失落之兩錨及鐵練、價値甚巨、約近萬元、當時同華一再打撈、未能起獲、遂開歸上海、由船主陳報總局、茲經招商局致函直東輪公司、責令將同華輪在大埔港内沉失之兩鐵錨、代爲打撈、如果局方打撈、則損失須歸該公司負担、</p>

<p>吴淞楊林口怪事</p>
<h3>押解海盗忽來二火</h3>
<p>盤旋數匝霹靂一聲竄入</p>
<p>船中數人受傷忽聚一處</p>
<p>前在通州洋面充任游巡隊隊長之朱松舟、年四十三歲、浙江杭州人、自被撤職後、即率其部下約二百餘人、盤居南通洋面之小洋山、流爲海盜船隻被刦者、數不勝數、去歲南通江蘇水上省公安局曾派大批水警前往兜剿、結果均被匪擊退、是後朱部聲勢浩大、手下亦自二百餘增至千餘、而朱則匿居滬上、逍遙自若、本月十一日、經人報告、被法捕房在葛羅路仁元里五號拘獲、角解送第二特院審訊、南通方面、得悉是項消息後、當派江蘇水上省公安局第四區偵緝隊副主任戴俊卿來滬、向第二特院移提、經王綱熙庭長核准、於十三日下午、僱一民船、由外灘起程、詎船將抵吳淞時、忽烏雲密布、雷聲隆隆、及至楊林口、則狂風暴雨繼之而來、當時船仍繼續前進、戴偕武裝二兵士及探員二人在艙内監視朱松舟、其時在船尾把舵之船伙、忽見空中二火球直向船上而來、將至船面、忽向船之週圍盤旋、一時全船大驚、路過之船、睹狀亦不敢近、此時戴遂命停行、詎二火球繞船數匝、即聞</p>
<p>霹靂一聲、隨聲竄入艙内、當將戴之二兵士背部灼傷、而朱松舟之腿部亦被灼、水泡纍纍、痛不可言、其時船員已入艙、將傷人包紮、而此兩火球則在艙内愈施愈急、最奇者又一霹靂、衆人忽聚於一起、排列甚齊、至此二球遂滅、舟中人相顧愕然、呆若木雞、時天已淸朗、烏雲四散、舟子乃解纜開行、一幕怪劇、亦告閉幕、舞女王小妹</p>
<h3>爲送小棺材涉訟</h3>
<p>控某洋行職員張叔良無故損害信譽</p>
<p>自棺材送來後即惡運頓臨患病不起</p>
<p>本案今日下午公開審理</p>
<p>大滬跳舞場舞女王小妹、年華十九、色藝雖非超羣、摩登却是絕倫、致喜與擁抱者每夕競相追逐、該舞女則以爲係其藝術所感召、遂漸目空一切、待對舞客之態度、不免有所軒輊、而曾遭白眼之舞客、積怨於胸、常思發洩、申是乘機與之惡作劇、而</p>
<h3>大開玩笑之事</h3>
<p>層出不窮矣、該舞女家住法租界霞飛路四明里六號、某日忽有酒館遣人送治就之盛饌數席至其家、又一日、忽有汽車行車夫駕駛汽車數輛至其家、均稱係應召而來者、該舞女明知爲人作弄、然亦無可奈何、祇得給付菜價車資、此種金錢損失、如啞子之吃黃蓮、徒自認晦氣而已、該舞女傲岸成性、雖屢遭玩弄、仍自驕氣横秋、故上月廿一夜半、乘汽車兜風納涼、駛經滬西愚園路時、又被稔者所駕之汽車略施手腕、使兩車互撞、雖彼此俱無所損、而其芳心則幾乎驚碎、不料事更愈出愈奇、撞車之一週後、至上月廿七淸晨、其家突來兩人、隨帶</p>
<h3>新製之小木棺</h3>
<p>一具、謂因有人往愷自爾路許長興棺材店定製、此項棺材、着送交尊府者、彼等奉店主命、舁棺前來、並請將棺價給付回店交賬等語、當時王小妹旣驚且恨、即遷怒於舁棺之兩店員、扭送法捕房、請求追究主使之徒、該兩店員初因不知定棺者之姓氏里居、故無所陳述、法捕房亦以事無綫索、爰飭王小妹退去、候查明核辦、從此該舞女</p>
<h3>終日戚戚不樂</h3>
<p>晚間亦不再現色相於舞場、直至上月三十夜、有某洋行職員張叔良因友人贈給大滬舞塲之茶舞劵以爲不須破費乃往觀之、張雖屬翩翩年少、但素來不喜涉足舞榭歌台、是夕之往觀舞猶屬破題　第一遭也詎坐甫定、忽有兩健者疾趨其前、向　略一端視、即稱君之友人立候與君談話、速隨往一晤張以與該兩人素昧平生、拒不欲去、奈被再四纒擾、姑離座隨行、抵該舞塲之衣帽室、兩健者態度陡變、詢張何故</p>
<h3>購棺送王小妹</h3>
<p>家、張立白從無此舉兩健者則强詞奪理、竟欲坐實事由張爲、致互起口角、巡捕聞聲馳至、將雙方一併帶入新閘捕房、而王小妹及許長興棺材店中人亦偕赴捕房、經捕頭逐一質訊之下、王小妹稱、對張向不相識、棺材店中人稱、定棺者形貌似張、故於製就後、是日上午十一時、送往王宅云云、而張即以據呼人所供定棺送棺時間、正彼在洋行工作時間、要求捕頭澈底查究、以免冤抑、捕頭審核結果、認張叔良對於送棺一事、</p>
<h3>並無確切證據</h3>
<p>遂將諸人揮去、張旣離捕房、自思與王小妹以前從未謀面、更無仇怨、而竟無端誣控、有意陷害、當日即委任律師陳德明致函王小妹交涉、要求用書面道歉、否則决以法律周旋、俾明是非、乃該舞女得函、非特對張所提條件不允接受、且爲先發制人計、亦延邬鵬律師具狀第一特區地方法院、控張</p>
<h3>無故損害信譽</h3>
<p>謂該項小棺材實係張指使人所送、即七月廿一午夜、愚園路撞車、亦係張欺伊弱質、故弄狡獪、並將昔日其家由酒館送到酒席及汽車行開往汽車之舊事、一一重提、未則稱自送棺事件發生、使自訴人果遭其殃、無故患病不起、惡運頓臨、精神物質、以及信用、均受損失、被告實犯刑法三百卅條及三百八十三條之罪、請求按律懲治云云、但張叔良不獨否認送棺、並不承有撞車情事、謂本人旣無力置汽車、復不喜御汽車、該舞女所述、若非張冠李戴、便是故意羅織、現此案將於今日下午、由第一特院公開審理、孰是孰非、一經就鞫、不難水落石出也、</p>
<h3>王小妹之訴述</h3>
<p>昨據王女語人云、張叔良與周姓等與小妹因跳舞結下仇隙、先於上月二十一日午夜、余乘自備汽車、駛經愚園路上兜風、適遇周姓之汽車、以余弱質可欺、竟以車相撞、余爲息事寗人起見、不與計較、詎張等復於上月二十七日早晨、竟敢冒余之名義、向法租界愷自邇路許長興棺材店定購童棺一具、即命舁送至余家、當將送棺材之店夥扭至捕房、經夥友供出買材之人音容面貌、事後余領該夥友至大滬跳舞場指認、張叔良即係當時定購棺柩之人、當由舞塲派人報告英捕房、以被告犯罪地點、係在法租界、故不受理、今查張叔良住在公共租界唐家弄徐家花園一九二號、故向第一特區法院管轄衙門起訴、而伊等不但是舁送童棺之惡作劇、且曾屢次有同様之嬉謔、例如無故忽有覺林蔬菜館酒席數桌、抬至家中、又無故忽有出差汽車出差搬塲汽車十餘輛、開至余家、又有順風牌鮮橘水數十打送來余家均以電話囑送、諸如此類之事、不勝枚舉、然余經此之後、受驚得病、臥床不起、經延西醫診治、略得痊愈、然於精神物質及名譽信用上、均受莫大之損失、業由邬律師以刑法三三○條及同法三八三條等罪起訴、請求處以應得之罪、并附帶民訴云云、</p>

<h3>警士突然失踪</h3>
<p>不像潛逃···或謂已死</p>
<p>浦東陸家　英美烟廠請願警趙鳴皐、於前晚自九時至十二時、値江邊第二十五號崗位、當十時許、警長姜茂桂查崗經過、猶見其站守原崗、盡其職務、詎至午夜十二時調差時、另一警士朱甲璠前往接崗、竟未見該警踪影、朱料其係先回警所、亦未可知、不料至昨晨五時、仍踪跡杳然、當經姜警長報明王永懋區員、往趙警寓所調查、（該警本有家眷住在烟廠路附近）據其妻云、乃夫迄未回家、王區員益爲驚疑、旅復派警往站崗江邊偵察、亦無形跡、致失踪原因、難得線索、謂其被匪謀害、或係投浦自盡、似亦可信、至指其濳逃、則無反證、蓋趙警家中衣箱絲毫未動、决不走此一途、是以該警已不在人世之說、益近可靠、昨日午後、王區員已報告三區、由張區長轉報總局、通令飭查、查該警年三十二歲、河北人、爲警已五六年、</p>
<h3>盜刦三千圓</h3>
<p>廣東路白晝盜刧</p>

<h3>减低定期存欵利率</h3>

<p>錦標賽在倫敦附近惠勃爾登全英總會之革塲上舉行、自六月二十六日星期一起迄七月八日星期六止、比賽中發生不少驚人之事、動人觀感之個人與雙打隊在最初數日中、皆遭敗北、馬迪夫人之保持冠軍、早在意料之中、至於梵恩斯、舊的冠軍事前以爲較克勞福佔優勢克在第一日、曾險遭敗滅在過去之三年中、美國之失敗較其成功爲顯著、其雙打冠軍梵恩斯與格蘭希爾敗於澳洲之呑白爾與奎斯脫、全美第三名選手塞德及第六名選手史篤芬、皆未能表顯其平日之成績、塞德且以直落三敗於休斯、英國第一名選手潘葉、第二日卽爲南菲法瓜生所敗、奧斯汀以五盤敗於日本佐藤因而未得到達複賽、本屆參加者、各方各應之明星、搜羅殆盡可謂盛矣、</p>
<h3>六月二十八日（星期三）</h3>
<p>今日爲大會第三日、此驚人之事絕對出諸意料、且非一小的變化梵恩斯與格蘭希爾在中央塲上、敗覆於兩澳人呑白爾與奎斯脫之手、其失敗有非以言語可形容者、美國組旣勝第一第二兩盤、在第四盤完結時、有一線轉機之望、但仍一厥而不復振、梵格兩人、星期五在皇后總會中比賽、情形甚佳、而星期日在洛森浦敦、則又有不能相信之惡劣而失敗、兩人難言彼此、與吞奎之戰、以六比四、七比五苦戰勝首先兩盤、第三盤澳隊得勝又佔前第四盤、奎斯脫發球爲美隊擊破、成各四、比賽不無掃興、四人皆有不可諒解之錯誤格蘭希爾最甚、呑白爾奎斯脫最佳、梵恩斯曾在發球之一局、零零四十、而獲勝利、各四之後、格氏發球、十五四十、進成平等、旣而又佔先一記、忽又不能振作、爲澳隊所獲、又勝次局、而得第四盤、成各二、在此期間、梵恩斯一無精彩、</p>
<p>同時在第一塲中、爲塞德史篤芬對法之　林與白那特、無可稱贊、在中央塲中、掌聲四起、澳選手大受英人之鼓掌、獲得勝利、其勝利爲應有之結局、</p>
<p>從談話中所得、知梵思斯今日每次愈下、且將格蘭希爾拖帶而不可復、格之發球、先被擊破、梵隨之、兩人幾無所作爲、從未有一對第一流雙打、擊球如此惡劣者、此旣非失之不經心不留意、亦非輕視對敵實則不能表演更佳之球技耳、最　之四盤、格蘭希爾最壞、梵雖履次上前、　　線外、較格尚可取、</p>
<p>呑白爾爲是日之英雄、球有力　　而美　、　斯脫從而轉佐之、奎僅在第四盤中、不少錯誤、　擊敗美國雙打冠軍梵思斯格蘭希爾之澳洲雙打隊呑白爾奎斯脫在比賽中間休息之神氣</p>
<p>此錯誤、否則兩澳人目將以直落三得勝矣、全局處處取攻勢、上前攔殺、兩美人則處處後退、步伐紊亂、軟弱不可比、</p>
<p>在一完全不同之局面中、英國他氏得勝澳洲麥格雷斯、大受歡迎、李氏在第一盤中、抓住對敵、繼而直前、不可找禦、正手一擊、制人死命、抽球中五分之四、深入兩翼、使對方疲於奔命、僅反手較弱、其步法、方向、不改變之準確、爲李氏最令人注意之點、其可怕之進攻、自底線進抵半塲、　示其充滿熱血、李氏常使球不入麥之反手、爲一　明之戰術、</p>
<p>在少年之麥格雷斯言、自始至終、皆心與願違、不無减色卽李氏之抽球、麥亦不敢試以高球或上網　之、但平心言、麥之球尚不惡、卽在將失敗且失勇氣之完局時、麥尚在奮鬥、休斯亦使英人歡舞、擊敗日人靑木、總共僅負三局耳、除不少斬球外、擊法與李氏無二、精細、有力、無處不佳、佐藤雖勝拉賽德、但毫不動人、慢、無趣味、反手球較平日軟弱多多、拉賽德爲一特殊之長人、紐西蘭之史丹特曼、與南菲柯豋、苦鬥五盤、史方得勝、史穩健不屈不撓、柯豋勝一四兩盤、但一望而知爲非勝手、美國勃威爾與柯顯戰到第五盤、而以一比○佔先、足可自豪、自不費氣力勝勃爾後、滿抱自信與柯顯戰、第一盤勃威爾勝、柯顯僅獲兩局、勃威爾進步之速可喜、各種擊法俱能、所差欠思　耳、柯勝二三兩盤、第四盤將勝、而爲勃以七比五奪得、勃在第五盤、共得三局、柯顯遠不如平日、大半上網、愛蘭爾勞傑斯勝德人倫特、第五盤爲七比五、南菲勞平斯、敗於美人瓊思、此局爲猛烈發球及進攻、與穩守之决戰、</p>
<p>女子選手、增進球員景色不少、皆衣服美麗、高弗列夫人自史克列文女士手中得勝一盤、混合雙打開塲、馬迪夫人與體斯勝利、</p>
<p>塞德史篤芬對白那特墨林、美隊勝第一盤而失第二在極危中、挽救第三盤、法人旣破對手發球、而墨林得四十○之數、墨立於網前、僅須一殺不須氣力可勝、但墨林竟送人網内、使美人得此一局、又勝其次、使盤數成一比一、法人頓見動搖、美人更覺自信、以六比四勝第四盤、史篤芬爲最弱之人、墨林可取、稍有錯誤、白那特鎭靜、塞德爲有頭腦得分最多之人、入後愈佳、史篤芬隨之上進、雖第一塲之觀衆、對比賽滿意、但錯誤太多、不免减色、</p>

<h3>吸引力與購買力</h3>
<p>— 仰莽</p>
<p>國貨發展，首要在推銷國貨之市塲，而能否誘致一般顧客之注意，第一在吸引力。旣巳吸引顧客之注意矣，又須注意其是否具有購買之力量，與購買力之高下。請分述其旨：</p>
<p>（一）吸引力吸引力最大之利器，首推報紙廣告，儘有極精良廉美之貨物，儘有大量生産之出品，以無廣告之吸引力，而無人光顧，無人過問，此爲如何之不經濟，如何之大損失。天下惟最聰明之經理，纔能利用廣告，知廣告之登載，確有不可思議之效力。用一分之廣告費，可收十分二十分之利益，一般經理以廣告爲應酬品，人情禮物，作爲浪費之開支者，實屬大誤。吾親聞一有經騐之化妝品店主言：廣告之效力，捷於影響，苟某日多用廣告力量，則門市與批發生意，陡增兩倍以上。如果停止數日，则主顧便减少，而貿易額下降。屢試如此，無可强辦。可見吸引力於國貨事業，關係極大，而不容不切實注意，以增關推銷國貨之市塲於無形中也。（二）購買力欲維持國貨之推銷，製造精良，價廉物美，使用耐久，自爲必要條件。而人民具有購買貨物之經濟能力，尤屬必要之必要。市塲上不少高貴物品，僅爲資産階級所享用，而不能普徧於一般平民，並非一般平民所不樂用，實因經濟能力所趕不到也。吾國廠商所製造之國貨，當然爲大多數人着想，以期推銷之範圍廣大。設一般人衣食住重要問題尚在困苦之掙扎中，其他各種日用物品，自無購用之能力。購買力對於貨物之推銷，有聯帶之關係，互爲消長，購買力弱，推銷難，購買力强，推銷易，此爲至易觀察之事理。最近我國農村破産，經濟衰落，内地人民之購買力，年不如年，以致國貨推銷，大受影響。今歲與去年比，各工廠之營業額，平均僅佔十分之五六，此爲如何危險之現象？故今日中國欲期國貨之發展，全在購買力之培養，培養購買力之方法，惟有希望各工廠多多採用内地原料，並設法改良指導，使出品優良，而成本低廉，合於内地人民之需要，使内地人民經濟狀况入於佳境，則國貨之推行，自能事半功倍也。</p>
<p>國貨談話</p>
<h3>如何變入超而爲出超</h3>
<p>— 天虚我生</p>
<p>美棉抛售外商，固爲華商紗廠所僨慨，但爲政府計，需財孔亟，亦屬不得不然，而所借之麥，亦必循此故轍可知。惟吾以爲根本救濟之法，决不在於收回成命，而在我全國之民，同其好惡，即足以挽頽風，試觀同日報載（二十二年八月六日申報）英議員阿士德偑利氏云：『日貨之襲來，比之戰爭尤爲危險，英國行將受此黃禍之厄，雖提高關稅，亦不能防止侵入，吾人應急起力謀驅逐之方法，』雖不知英國所謂急起力謀之方法如何，但就我國民衆而論，人心好惡，大抵皆同，羞惡之心，人皆有之。假令全國學生，工友，到處定傳，勸令各地農村，自紡自織，競以服用土布爲榮，而以服用細紗洋布爲恥，軍警服裝，凡需新置者，悉皆取用土布，上級官長，則屏呢絨而用棉綢，以示表率。上有好者，下必甚焉。交際塲中，見有服用洋貨者，則就大庭廣衆之間，起立演說，勸人勉用國貨。與用高價之洋布，毋寗改用廉價之絲綢，與用人造絲織品，毋寗改用濮綢台絹之類，而且大綢之價，亦已低於人造絲綢之價。予在杭州展覽會中，親見之矣。吾國民衆，不外士農工商四類，此四類人之衣冠，本</p>
<p>皆取用國貨，在此三十年前，惟有喪者之凶服，始屏絲綢而用麻布，好奢侈者，恥爲布衣，乃用羽毛洋緞爲之，社會中人，雖不加以訾議，但以幽默的諷剌熊度，稱服洋貨者爲孝服，其意正謂無人敎訓，乃不肖之子孫耳。富人歛屍必以帛，窮人歛屍則以布，從無採用洋貨者，故凡婚喪嫁娶，消費絲綢之量，實至偉大。即屬車馬几椅門窓板壁以及燈鏡之類，亦必被以絲綢，加以綿繡，是蓋吸收士大夫之過剩金錢，正以救濟農工商者，而一切儀仗虚文，亦爲救濟貧民而設。例如乞丐終日，能得幾文，而掮牌執事，僅勞半日，即足三餐，此種幽默主義，不過未經道破而已。實際上不啻爲貨幣流通主義，正以有餘者，補不足耳。現今社會方針，一味剷除舊習，所爲迷信，非用全勢力打倒不可。殊不知，換湯而不換藥，不迷信於舊習，而迷信於歐化，翻以販自外來之全勢力，打倒我國内之農工商，其禍患之烈，實有甚於洪水猛獸，若不急起力謀，吾民眞無立足地矣。故吾以爲乘此國貨年中，盡力宣傳提倡，使土布絲綢，恢復其固有之用途，即麵食一端，亦屏洋麵粉於不用，華商紗廠及麵粉廠可以聯合一致，直接自設消費社於各都市間，使有購買力者，不致買錯，略如淸眞敎門之食品一般。吾料人心未死，未必漠然無動於中，而天下興亡，匹夫有責，吾人所當急起力謀驅逐之方法，只在此棉與麥米三項。試觀海關歲計，只此三項，入超達五萬萬以上，若將此三項之利權挽回，即足以變入超而爲出超，其事固甚明確，其權固操於任何人之個人身手間也。有不聽者，除非妄人，孟子嘗謂：『妄人者與禽獸何異，人與禽獸奚擇焉，』則但於衣冠食料上覘之可矣，衣冠禽獸，可恥孰甚，主人欵客，而以『豕交之獸畜之』者，不敬孰甚，　是可忍，孰不可忍。好人之所惡，惡人之所好，災必殆乎身，吾願舉國之人，一秉良心作用，以正好惡而反其本，我中國庶有豸乎？</p>
<p>國貨討論</p>
<h3>國貨展覽後的任務</h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>最近這幾個月來蓬勃各地的國貨展覽會，擴大宣傳，盛極一時，自嘉屬六縣·寗波·鎭江·各國展閉幕而後，即有南京·靑島的同時舉行，威海衛·福建省的繼續成立，而遠隔重洋的暹邏·新加坡，聞也將準備前往，車蜃馬腹，乘風破浪，我國貨界在這個年頭裏，加緊工作，努力進行，深知我國幅員之廣，人口之衆，而歷來深受外貨傾銷，充斥内地，一般民衆服用洋貨，相沿成習，今欲謀國貨之發展，自以深入民間，務使家喻户曉爲要圖，而國貨展覽會爲進行前導之唯一利器，可使一般民衆得到相當之認識，密切之結合，用意深長，自不待言，至他的功效和使命，在我們進行發展國貨的程序上，自然是第一重最重大的工作。</p>
<p>不過，暫時性質的國貨展覽會，他只除了有陳列館的可常供陳列外，他的開會時期，總是很短的。過去的事實，我們就可覆按，歷屆展覽會輒以閉幕爲結束點，往往不肯加努力，其實，這是完全錯誤的。國貨展覽會的閉幕，們只可承認是完成了國貨進行的第一部份工作，不能認爲任務已了。須知國貨展覽會的效果，不過使一般民衆暫時的興奮，若不繼續努力，實仍不能牢繁其購買國貨的意志，所以。他是空泛的。我們在這個段落告成後，急應去幹一點實際工作，確切進行，而以管見所及，國貨展覽後似應有下列之任務：　　一·創設永久性之機關無論何地，於國貨展覽會初行閉幕之時，各界人士對於國貨的好感，自必比較任何時侯爲親密，我們眞當乘此良機，進一步的就地創設永久性的機關，最近據國貨産銷彙報所載，靑島·南京·於此展會初停之後，即有國貨公司之组織，前涂順利，行將開幕，這種切實進行的工作，其將來擴展國貨前途，自不待言。　　二·聯絡當地販賣商或人民團體如上列所云之機關，在各大通商要埠，</p>
<p>設立自較便易，不過，以各地情形之不同，商業之盛衰，组織創立，或有不可能者，那麽我們也只有與當地販賣商或人民團體推誠聯絡，成立互約，於閉幕後可仍繼續向滬上國貨廠商，直接訂購，則國展雖閉，精神尚在，功績永留，自也爲我人刻不容緩之工作。　　於此各地國展均將閉幕之際，謹貢區區，未么諸國貨先進，以爲何如。</p>

<h3>國貨鎖</h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>鄕人楊志義君，集資糾集神聖工友，辦一小規模之利用五金工業廠於虹口胡家木橋嘉德里八號，先從呈製造一切鎖類，爲將來事業擴展之出發點，其志可嘉。現在已出有一種彈子門鎖，商標爲狗牌，寓如警犬守門之意，較之舶來品『司匹令』鎖，不相上下。而售價特低，每副二元五角，該鎖材料完全採用國貨，故尤値得提倡，據君說明，狗牌鎖的優點如左：</p>
<p>（一）彈子頂上之彈簧，用耐酸化學錭絲，永不生銹，而其伸縮力，較其他銅絲彈簧，約大二倍。</p>
<p>（二）彈簧不用○形，而成○形，取其阻力减少。</p>
<p>（三）彈子尖端，車成凸形，使彈簧適套其上，而免去軋住不靈之弊。　　（四）所有容納彈子彈簧之洞眼，用特種鑽拙鑽成，故距離深淺，悉能一律，鑰匙進出，毫無阻滯。</p>
<p>該鎖余曾親眼見之，確極堅固耐用，並附揰圖說明書一小册，亦有警策之語，如『吾人對於國貨。與非國貨。當然買國貨。國貨與國貨比較。當然買較好的國貨。』並有三句口號是：『我們反對粗製濫造，我們要爲國貨增光，我們但願國人批評。』</p>
<p>楊君等，確是脚踏實地的去埋頭苦幹，余敢在此寳貴園地，作新工業之介紹，倘亦國貨公司，與同胞所樂聞乎。</p>

<h3>新出品之國貨時鐘</h3>
<p>— 宜菊</p>
<p>時鐘一物，爲普通家庭必須備有之用品，惟考國人所用者，大都爲舶來品，國産時鐘，國内市塲，絕少見有，故每年外貨時鐘之輸入，爲數甚大，此固由於國内實業界之鮮加注意，而國人喜購外貨之心理，亦有以致之。</p>
<p>本埠昌明電器公司製鐘部，年來製造國貨時鐘，頗爲努力，其所出品，式様新頴。精良準確。不特在國内首稱獨步，亦且足與舶來品並駕齊驅，故自出品以來，備受社會人十士之歡迎，故營業一項，亦頗爲發達，預料該公司前途，新近必有發展。</p>
<p>最近，該公司爲擴大宣傳，俾便喚起社會人士之注意，並爲應各界要求起見，特在南京路抛球塲口愼昌鐘表行舉行國貨時鐘展覽會三天，自八月三日起，十五日止，頗受各界之歡迎與注意也。</p>

<h3>古巴革命幽默觀</h3>
<p>— 瞻慶</p>
<p>在這革命的年頭兒，世界各國，閙不完的革命，最近，古巴革命我以爲很有些幽默意味。</p>
<p>總統馬嘉度，國務卿佛拉拉，陸軍總長海拉拉，都是被逐於革命軍旗幟之下。西文譯名，只取諧音，本無一定的字；倘把，馬嘉度譯作『駡街渡』，佛拉拉譯作『伐拉拉』，海拉拉譯作『瞎拉拉』，那便來得幽默了。</p>
<p>『駡街渡』做了總統，鬧得民怨沸騰，這一番衆叛親離，站脚不住，他才坐着飛機逃去；民衆捉不到總，當然在道路上放聲痛駡，於是乎『駡街渡』在駡街聲中飛渡天空而去了。幽默哉古巴逃走總統『駡街渡。』</p>
<p>『駡街渡』逃走以前，他還簽發命令，命陸軍總長『瞎拉拉』爲臨時總统，『駡街渡』旣失民心，『駡街渡』委任的『瞎拉拉』臨時總统，也不得老百姓歡迎；只有兩小時的運命，那位『瞎拉拉』總统，以被民衆逼走了。『五日京兆』，已嫌短促，『瞎拉拉』的兩點鐘總統，可謂短之又短，促之更促了，這不成了朝菌政府，　蛅總统麽？『瞎拉拉』三字，眞個名副其實，『駡街渡』急於脫身，『瞎猫拖了死老蟲』，管他勝任不勝任，便胡亂委任『瞎拉拉』做臨時總統，瞎了眼睛去拉人，『瞎拉拉』三字，不是名副其實麽？　　古巴的國務卿，以呌做『伐拉拉』，左一個拉拉，右一個拉拉，敢是组織了拉拉隊麽？『伐拉拉』也是個寳貝，民衆恨之切齒，他們擁入『伐拉拉』的相府裏面，大伸共撻伐主義；幸而，『伐拉拉』脚快，逃往航空塲，乘飛機亡命美國，才沒有被撻伐者一把拉住了。假使，慢了一步，撻伐者追往航空塲，把他一把拉住了，那才是名不虚傳的『伐拉拉』呢。又有一說：撻伐者拉住了他，他便是『伐拉拉』；撻伐者拉不住他，讓他逃走了，飛機逃命的時候，宛比來了拉引佛，把他拉上西天，他便是佛拉拉了，反以『伐拉拉』也可以喚作『佛拉拉』。</p>
<h3>扇子雜譚</h3>
<p>— 妙神</p>
<p>只見伊扭着兒，坐上車去，把身子斜側坐着，一把玲瓏的鵝毛扇，扔在胸前。』這是小說家描寫少女以扇子爲裝飾，寫得掩映生姿！　　『他醬油色的背上，掛着黃豆般大的汗珠，額角和口顋，汗下如雨，揮着一把蒲扇；緃是上下搖得呼呼有聲，似不曾减少他一些熱度。』這是小說家描寫勞工『流汗』的又一幕了。</p>
<p>我們有一點，確然承認女人和男人有些不同：你看緃是酷暑的夏天，女人們穿着一件絕薄如蟬翼的紗衫，我們依稀望得見伊們的肉色，和兩條雪白的户帶，但很少看見伊們竟香汗淫淫，把件纱衫都汗得貼在肉上了。如紙一般的紗衫，怎不會汗濕的呢？反觀男人們的長衫，背上大都有汗迹的。</p>
<p>有人說女人心靜，所以不易出汗，就是熱，伊們取把扇子也僅微微的扇着胸部；不像男子的常是滿頭大汗，專是狂扇頭部的。</p>
<p>女人果然心靜，但比較年長的高僧，還不如遠甚，你看和尚覺得熱，只以扇子輕輕扇手心。你再看勞工們，他們趕得熱了，以蒲扇狂扇胯下，眞可發笑！　　西洋人緃是大熱天，不取扇子，但也不見他們怎様的汗流浹背，中國人似乎比較的會流些汗，我想。</p>
<p>小調中：『一把扇子七寸長，一人扇風二人凉』；辭雖粗俗，也頗見情趣。從前人談情，大都偷偷摸摸，假納凉爲名，便『一人扇風二人凉，』傾吐私情；現在人談情，堂而皇之，不避耳目，約情人相偕游公園，相倚相偎，當衆接吻　　從前理髮店内，到了夏天，都裝白竹布的拉風扇。命學徒在屋角，以手拉繩，扇動風生，但這種風扇，呆笨而風小；現在理髮店内大都裝了電風扇了，也足見扇子也跟了時代而前進。</p>
<h3>跳舞場裏</h3>
<p>— 東海波臣</p>
<p>這醉人的跳舞塲裏，一切都含有神秘的情緒，酒的陶醉，肉的引誘，微笑的渦，俏媚的眼，雪白的玉腿···：：：這些這些，如蛇一般會使你靈魂兒銷沉。</p>
<p>穿着雪白制服的待者，如小鳥似的飛來又飛去，他引導着舞客，一批，二批，三批，：：：：但沒有一些倦意。　　跳舞的時間還沒有到啦！舞客都在低聲地調笑。幾個憑着大腿生活的舞女，靜靜的在光滑如镜的塲中，練習着探戈式的舞姿，多肉感的醉熊！</p>
<p>某一個角落裏，舞女坐在一個西裝靑年的大腿上，他們在侂効着『璇宮艷史』裏麥唐納和希佛萊Ｋｉｓｓ的姿勢。</p>
<p>『喂！沒有錢用啦』。舞女低聲的說。　　『啊！』大疊鈔票滑到舞女的手裏。　　第一次跳舞開始了，在黑暗的塲中，整個顫動着人影，臉兒，胸部······告靠得多麽緊。『跳啊』！『·····』熱血怒沸正如從容赴義的戰士。</p>
<p>紫色的燈光又照耀到全塲，調笑，情話，開始活躍。　　第二次跳舞開始，第三次·····。　　在魚白色的曙光中，一個個帶着倦意歸去。跳舞塲裏的待者，又忙着整理塲中的工作，預備明天的舞客跳舞啦！</p>
<h3>易容術</h3>
<p>— 醉痴生</p>
<p>一天，在下和幾位朋友，在北市一家酒樓飲酒。隔座有三位西裝靑年，都操着很流利的英國話。起初的時候聽了，以爲其中必有外國朋友在内。後來在他們尊容上仔細一看，原來都是『貨眞價實』的貴同胞，倒不覺詫異起來。有時雖夾着幾句本國話，但不過十中一二。從這談話中窺探出來，曉得他們都是『大學』出身，現在做的是洋行生意。在下就對朋友道：此輩似是而非的新人物，好算是都市中的驕子。他們渾身充滿着洋氣，穿的是洋裝，說的是洋話，學的是洋派，吃的是外國飯，講的是外國道理。『洋理洋腔，』自以爲風頭十足了。但可惜他們的鼻子太低，未美中不足。沒有那高高的『隆準，』究不能和眞正白種人媲美。現在好了，科學發達，往往『巧奪天工。』聽說現在歐美各國，新發明『易容術。』倘然眼睛晕瞎了，能換上和眞一様的眼睛。若鼻子太低，有損美觀。也能照様裝高，毫無痕跡。此種『改造博士，』大可以請到貴中國來，應社會的需要，在都市裏開設幾家『易容院，』把這般『醉心洋化』的貴國人，一一從頭至尾改造起來；先把最緊要的鼻子裝高。再用藥水把烏黑的頭髮，染成棕褐色。（這層摩登女子，也十分贊成的。）再把身體遍搽藥水，使黃色變成白色。那汗毛，也毛茸茸的生長。這様一來，從心所欲，如願以償。雖種族上，是冒牌外國人。但形式上，已完全是外國人，也不必再入什麽外國籍了。到了　那時，躊躇滿志，趾高氣揚。就是亡國，也不怕了。一切的一切，都不必擔憂了，豈不見大大的造化嗎。說得幾位朋友都鼓掌稱善：</p>
<p>這時那三位靑年，好像沟有聽見。仍舊『愛皮西蒂，』談興很濃。在下於是把這一席話，記了下來。謹告普天下『西式同胞，』將來可以如法泡製，『理想』總有成爲『事實』的一日！</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>

<p>關耀武笑道：我想喝冬瓜湯，怎能夠不跑呢？桂枝聽了，也不害臊，大大方方的，在坑沿上坐着。關耀武笑道：表妹也知道我會來嗎？咱們有正經事情商量呢，你知道我要來，就不該躱開。桂枝道：我躱開你作什麽？我到隔壁街坊家有點事情去了。關耀武道：你回來了就很好，大姨爲了這事，現時正要决不下來，你·····桂枝正了顔色搶着答道：婚姻大事，又不是買賣零碎，有個麩來回掉換。我們先是怎麽様子說，還是怎麽様子說。呌人辭差不幹的話，我們可沒有那意思。爲人只要有一分兒誠心，作朋友也好，作親戚也好，比什麽都强。關耀武笑道：這個様子說，老趙總算是有誠心的了，他爲了你他願意辭了連長不幹。桂枝却沒有說什麽，微微的一笑。關耀武看他這種怀形，已千肯萬　肯。趙自强那一番犧牲的决心，總不曾算是白費了。關耀武站起來笑道：旣是這麽着，事情算是大定，我這就回老趙一個信。說着站了起來。桂枝道：表哥咱們是親戚·····說着他噗嗤一聲笑了。關耀武這倒有些愕然，咱們是親戚怎麽様？心裏如此想時，也就望了桂枝作聲不得。桂枝笑道：你發𪳯作什麽？我並不是說别的。我以爲咱們是親戚，遇事你得顧全着我一點。剛才我和你說的這些話，你可别告訴别人。要不，我這話算沒說。關耀武笑道：大姑娘，你眞是好的，旣要裏了，又要面子。我們是親戚，我得那麽辦。你放心得了，這個時候，你封王啦，還能得罪你嗎？於是乎哈哈一笑而去。（一六○）</p>
<p>小常識</p>
<h3>吃西瓜的常識</h3>
<p>— 竹影自靑寄</p>
<p>一到了夏天，任何美酒佳餙，山珍海錯，都不如吃西瓜可口了。</p>
<p>但是在未剖未吃之前，那隻西瓜，是否成熟，是我們所必須知道的。俗話說得好，隔皮猜瓜，隔皮猜瓜那能猜得準呢，卽或那隻西瓜，是完全成熟，也知你買彩票一般僥倖得着絕對不是你有把握而獲得的，那麽怎麽才曉得那西瓜完全成熟呢。</p>
<p>聽瓜諸君你用手敲一敲，那西瓜的外皮，聽一聽那西瓜的聲響，就曉得了，或問什麽聲響是熟的，什麽聲響不是熟的呢，諸君你但聽那西瓜聲響，鏘鏘如撾魚鼓，其聲悅耳，這表明這瓜已是十分成熟的，不會有半點生性了，否則其聲撲撲，與成熟者劃然兩異，這西瓜就是未曾成熟，不過這種聽音擇瓜，其初很難辦别的，但是你如果必須研究這種聽瓜問題，你必須以兩瓜或三瓜並列一處，敲打聽之，那就是很容易聽出來了。</p>
<p>敲瓜敲瓜又比聽瓜來得容易的多了，怎様敲呢，就是請你把一隻十餘斤重的西瓜，託在你自己的左手上，用你的自己的右手，輕輕的敲一敲，如果右手的聲音，震動左手，那麽這一隻西瓜，是己經成熟了，如果你的左手，註着西瓜，當你右手輕敲的時候，不見得有何震動，那是這西瓜距成熟的程度尚遠哩，還有，你如果當將一着手輕敲時，那西瓜先鐺噹直震手心，那是這西瓜，已經成熟過時了，諸君你敲時，有了這三種現象，你可以的確知道這西瓜熟否了。</p>
<p>揑瓜敲瓜，聽瓜，我已說過了，還有一種揑瓜，我再報告大家幾句，這種揑瓜，更是容易的了，諸君你把瓜用雙手捧起，以左右兩手</p>
<p>的拇指，緊按瓜的上端，用力試揑，設其聲沙沙作響，則此瓜業已成熟，反之，則否，但不可用力太猛，力猛設遇瓜此薄者，容易揑破呀瓜瓤的顏色瓜瓤的顏色，大概可分三種，紅的，白的，黃的，等等，以白的爲最佳，以紅的爲最鮮美，色紅如臙脂，黑子綠皮，人人都愛，卽或每一想到，都覺津津有味，但是想看出瓜瓤的顏色，是紅的，或是白的，也是很難猜　得着的，不你但看瓜秧的顏色，是深綠，或是淺綠，一看便知瓜瓤的顏色了。瓜秧深綠者，瓜瓤必是紅色，瓜秧淺綠者，瓜瓤必是白色，瓜秧淡綠而微帶黃色者，瓜瓤必是黃色，也如你看牡丹花的顏色，先看牡丹花的葉子，一様辦法，你明白這看花的辦法，你看瓜也就瞭如指掌了。</p>
<p>切瓜的刀切西瓜時，務必另用一把快刀，不許任何人動用此刀，以切魚肉葱蒜等及一切的菜蔬，最好用一把竹刀，以防鋼刀往往有一種鐵銹氣味，這是不可不注意的。　　乾秧你要注意，大概每一個西瓜上，都聯帶着一寸長短的綠秧。或附帶着一半個，手掌形的小綠葉，如果沒有這種鮮秧的西瓜，人們都說分是乾秧，乾秧就是說這西瓜是未成熟時摘下來的，瓜的成熟，是擱置熟的，不是在秧上成長熟的，擱置成熟的這種瓜的味道，當然不鮮嫩不適口了。</p>
<p>你買的西瓜如有一隻或二隻不甚成熟，你可以擱置三五日，或七八日，慢慢的就會成熟了。西瓜不可着雨水，一着雨水最易腐爛，或當時爆炸的，平日擱在室中，或樹蔭之下。</p>
<p>你剖開一個西瓜之後，吃得了麽，或吃不了，也切不可吃隔夜的西瓜，以其旣剖之後，易</p>
<p>招蒼蠅，易生微生物，而尤易致病了，卽使你剖的西瓜，不甚甜美，你不可參白糖，因爲你參了糖，但有一種甜糖的甜味，更吃不出西瓜的鮮味了。</p>
<p>我國出産西瓜的地方，以我山東德州之拉嘛瓜，最著名，而最價廉，瓜形如枕，抽以又有人說他是枕瓜，或說是喇嘛瓜，他們當地的人，都說是德州瓜，瓜瓤是臙脂一般的顏色，玉露漿般的甜美，路遇德州的無論任何人，都要買一塊嘗嘗，否則空過德放州一次了。</p>

<h3>『揩油』</h3>
<p>— 苯索</p>
<p>『揩油』，是說明着奴才的品行全部的。</p>
<p>這不是『取回扣』或『取佣錢』，因爲這是一種秘密；但也不是偷竊，因爲在原則上，所取的實在微乎其微。因此也不能說是『分肥』；至多，或者可以謂之『舞弊』。然而這又是光明正大的『舞弊』，因爲所取的是豪家，富翁，闊人，洋商的東西，而且所取也不過一點點，恰如從油水汪洋的處所，揩了一下，於人無損，于揩者却有益的，並且也不失爲損富濟貧的正道。設法向婦女　笑幾句，或乘機摸一下，也謂之『揩油』，這雖然不及對於金錢的名正言順，但無大損於被揩者則一也。</p>
<p>表現得最分明的是電車上的賣票人。純熟之後，他一面留心着可揩的客人，一面留心着突來的查票，眼光都練得像老鼠和老鷹的混合物一様。付錢而不給票，客人本該索取的，然而很難索取，也從不見有人索取，因爲他所揩的是洋商的油，同是中國人，當然有帮忙的義務，一索取，就變成帮助洋商了。這時候，不但賣票人要報你憎惡的眼光，連同車的客人也往往不免顯出以爲你不識時務的臉色。</p>
<p>然而彼一時，此一時，如果三等客中有時偶缺一個铜元，你却只好在目的地以前下車，這時他就不肯通融，變成洋商的忠僕了。　　在上海，如果同巡捕，門丁，西崽之類閑談起來，他們大抵是憎惡洋鬼子的，他們多是愛國主義者。然而他們也像洋鬼子一様，看不起中國人，棍棒和拳頭和輕蔑的眼光，專注在中國人的身上。　　『揩油』的生活有福了，這手段將更加展開，這品格將變成高尚，這行爲將認爲正當，這將算是國民的本領和對於帝國主義的復弊。打開天窗說亮話，其實，所謂『高等華人』也者，也何嘗逃得出這模子。但是，也如『喫白相飯』朋友那様，賣票人是還有他的道德的。倘被查票人查出他收錢而不給票來了，他就默然認罰，决不說沒有收過錢，將罪案推到客人身上去。</p>
<h3>談『劉思眞醜婦賦』</h3>
<p>— 羽屏</p>
<p>八月十二日自由談載子展君辭賦與小說篇中引嚴可均所輯先唐文劉思眞醜婦賦一篇，謂其辭語多不可解，疑爲當時俗諺，抑或字誤云。按此文原見唐徐堅初學記卷十九人部下醜人條，其文與子展君所引略有不同，茲錄原文於後，子展若所引有異者附注之。</p>
<p>人皆得令室，我命獨何咎。不遇姜任德，正値醜惡婦。才質陋目儉，姿容劇嫫母。（子展君姿作資）鹿頭獼猴面，椎頞復出口。（子展君椎頞作推額）折頞靨樓鼻，（子展君頞靨作額厭）兩眼　（原注一交切）如曰。膚如老桑皮，耳如側兩手。頭如研米槌，髮如掘掃菷。惡觀醜儀容，（子展君醜作厭）不媚似鋪首。（子展君似作如）闇鈍拙梳鬗，刻畫又更醜。妝頰如狗舐，額上獨偏厚。（子展君獨偏作偏獨）朱　如跳踏血，（子展若如作加）畫眉哪鼠負。傳粉堆頣下，面中不徧有。（子展君徧作偏）領如鹽豉襄，（子展若豉作鼓）袖如常拭釜。履中如和泥，爪甲有垢。脚皸可容箸，（子展若皸作皸）熟視令人嘔。</p>
<p>兩兩對照，子展若所見果有誤字。稍加改正，則難解之語，類皆可解。惟折頞靨樓鼻句尚不易曉，仍恐靨字誤也。初學記醜婦賦與劃　之龐郎賦朱彥時黑兒賦並引，龐郎黑兒二賦各錄數句，卽云詞汎不具載，醜婦賦下無此語，當是引用全文。子展謂疑非全璧，殆未必然。</p>
<h3>萬牲園看象記</h3>
<p>— 李</p>
<p>我到北平的時候，古物已第三批南遷了。</p>
<p>故宮深鎖着，兩尊古砲倒在午門口，牆上掛着柳條，遊客祇好在牆下惘然徘徊着。中南海公園作了×部長的行營，黃色琉璃瓦的大門外有憲兵站着崗，擋住胃失遊客的駕。然面北平到底是偉大的，此外尚有中山公園可以喝喝茶，北海公園可以看看荷花，十刹海可以　逛雜耍。出城呢，玩頣和園遊西山喝天下第一泉的玉泉山汽水。多花二毛錢，還可以走走萬牲園三貝子花園。</p>
<p>長人常樹德他去了，這在萬牲園不過九牛損一毛，其餘九千九百九十牲依然留着任人觀覽，兎子呀，哈叭狗呀，長尾巴狐狸呀，應有盡有；但其中要算鱷</p>
<p>魚和象最引人注目了。</p>
<p>據說鳄魚是有靈性的。那位文藝復興大師韓愈，曾爲牠們做過一篇大文章，我想鳄魚一定是博通方塊漢字的斯文一族，得另眼相看。然面另眼相看的结果，牠是這麽猙獰猥瑣的蠢焉一物；由來文曲星是靑面獠牙的，那還有什麽可說呢？</p>
<p>象的身軀眞龐大，巍巍然有天下獨尊之勢。然面被豢養牠的象奴任意驅使，比哈叭狗還馴復。牠忠心替主人赚錢，自己只嚼些須靑草；有時連這點靑草還得不到嘴，祇好伸着長長的鼻子，被遊客欺騙戲弄着。那一天，我和兩位朋友去看牠的那一天，牠居然生氣了。一位西裝華服的紳士之流先以靑草誘牠，玩弄着牠，不讓牠的鼻子捲到；後來把半枝點着火的香烟塞進他的長鼻子。牠勃然大怒了，躊躇片時，　呼地噴出一鼻子污水在旁邊的穿舊衣服的男子身上。眞是無妄之災，那男子意外的倒了霉。但是這是非常合理的，雖然那男子不曾惹着牠，但開罪華服男子何如噴污穿舊衣服的男子之爲得體呢？這倒是高明的主人敎會了牠，經過精密的打算才做出來的。</p>
<p>據鄕導告訴我，這只象是非常有名的，牠曾把許多野性未除的野象引入陷阱面得到榮譽；爲主人着實出過力。原來牠是這麽富有陷害同類的經騐的，難怪欺弱懼强的手段這麽高明！象這一族不久必列在有功世道人心的一類東西裏面是無疑的！</p>

<p>他說：『我爲了尋求眞理，做了二年半的世界行脚。·····我是從西到東，從北到南的旅行着。』我奇怪：這『二年半』以前，大約他是毫無『眞理』的『眞理』原來像金羊毛様，在等待着被人探訪，受人賞識的。後來，他歸國了，據　　　　『作爲歸朝第一聲的土産，把這一篇文章呈獻於日本全國的熱情俠血的靑年男女之前。』他爲日本帶來了他的眞理：</p>
<p>『昭和六年九月十八日，在奉天城外響起來的一發的砲聲，是殷殷然的響徹全世界六大洲的每一隅每一隅了。</p>

<p>『這是大拿破崙的一生中最得意的聲音。日本民族的生存的途徑，只有前進而已。　　『奔騰於這個偉大的時代之潮中，九千萬的日本民族，現在是做着偉大的世界史的進航了。』</p>
<p>不過『文章兩面看』，一天皇在上，走狗在下，成『天皇』的眼中，鶴見祐輔不就是一位赤心的忠臣了嗎？爲了他的『祖國日本』，我們可以原諒他罷。</p>
<p>以下是對我們的翻譯家而說的。</p>
<p>我常想集許多人的力量，翻譯外國人做的關於我們的文字；不管是謾駡也好，瞎捧也好，於我們一定有益，所謂『他山之石，可以攻玉』是也。可是最緊要的是；將『眞理把握住，不受任何的宣傳。這是翻譯這様的文字的翻譯家所應該知道的。</p>
<p>譬如這一篇鶴見祐輔的『尋求眞理』的文字，至少可以使我們認識了他，自由主義者的眞面目。做奴才：主人這一面，當然感到『唯我獨尊』；第三者看到了，未免不關痛癢，也許泠嘲熱　，至於奴才自己，那麽了天才的奴才以外，决不會『天王聖明，臣罪當誅』地心悅誠服的罷。</p>
<p>然而翻譯這篇文章的人在他的『譯從附記』裡，却『不禁感慨係之』地說道：『素日主張英雄政治，天才政治，高唱熱情主義，文藝英雄主義，憎惡資本主義議會政治，痛恨庸俗文化，亞美利加文化的鶴見祐輔先生，在這篇文章中，他的偉大的格和崇高的識見和不可遏抑的祖國愛的熱情更加躍躍於紙上。·····』我疑惑，這位翻譯先生究竟是中國人不是？</p>
<h3>拉蒲律耶語錄</h3>
<p>— 敷德</p>
<p>女人都是極端的；她們不是比男人好，就是比男人壞。</p>
<p>在愛情方面，女人比大部分男了深刻；但在友誼方面，男子比女人深刻。　　一個男子對於别人的秘密比自己的秘密保守得牢；反之，一個女人對於自己的秘密比别人的秘密保守得牢。</p>
<p>虚榮與愛情可以醫治女人的懶惰。且在生氣勃勃的女人，懶惰即是愛情的先兆。</p>
<p>有時候當一個女人對一個男子隱藏着她的熱情時、這男子却在她面前裝出他其實沒有的熱情。</p>
<h3>秋與春（續完）</h3>
<p>— 林微音</p>
<p>『收到信不復？那是，』他摸了摸他的口袋，『那是因爲我沒有就看。對咧，現在我再當面謝謝你，你把我那本書寄回來。』</p>
<p>『你常冩詩嗎？』</p>
<p>『不常冩。你很喜歡詩？』</p>
<p>露仙點點頭。</p>
<p>斯濱覺得有些什麽不適意，他才想起他還沒有吃過東西，想起了尤其覺得餓得難受。　　『從昨晚以來我還沒有吃過東西，你可以陪我去吃一些？』</p>
<p>『從昨晚？』</p>
<p>『是的，從昨晚起我就在等這一個會面，因此把吃東西都忘了。』</p>
<p>『你在作詩？』</p>
<p>『不，這的確是散文。』</p>
<p>露仙答應，到她的房間中去了大約一刻鐘的様子，就同斯濱一起出去。　　他們在殘秋的將近落山的陽光之下，走到了一個就近的珈琲間。他要了一個雞與沙拉和一杯威士忌蘇達；她不餓，只要了一杯冰朱古力。</p>
<p>聽到了威士忌，露仙有一些感觸，因爲她的一個關係最密找的人，可以說是死於威士忌的。所要的東西來了，她似乎在望着欺濱吃，其實己浸沉於自己的回憶中。她在想男子眞奇怪，在沒有得到他所要的女子的時候，總是想盡方法地要得到她，待旣得到一，却又似有若無地冷擱发她；要不是爲了那様，她的最親近的人也不致於死。</p>
<p>欺濱看到了露仙的沉思，他也不想去打斷它，索性把這沉默維持着，直到吃完他的雞與沙拉。</p>
<p>『抽烟？』</p>
<p>『哦！』露仙從那遞過來的烟盒裏抽出了一支。</p>
<p>『剛才沒有想到給你，對不起，』欺濱劃火給她點了，並點自己的。</p>
<p>『這是我怕對不起你示抽的，我並不常抽烟。』</p>
<p>『謝謝你。可是我還想請你爲我做一件好事，請你陪我到外國去。』</p>
<p>『陪你到外國去？』</p>
<p>『是的，可不可以？』</p>
<p>『必得立刻回答嗎？』</p>
<p>『雖不一定要立刻，可是遲疑似乎於回答並不有助益。我可以說得明顯一些，露仙，我們可應用任何名義，只要你肯同我在一起，而且我决不强求你做你所不願意做的事情。請你應允了如何？』</p>
<p>『我應允，欺濱，』那様急進的要求爲她平第一次遇見，她捨不得拒絕。</p>
<p>欺濱要了一份新聞紙，在同露仙一起找尋輪船出口報告，看要趁那一條船到那一國去。</p>

<p>昨期麥下午開盤後、大致微量俏利、以洋麥報價、坎拿大回好五六角右左、芝加哥無市、開市後、人心尚平、旋因某雜糧行大補空頭、前後市計有五六十車、而市塲之新套户、未見大暢、因此各盤開價、爲之抬住、至下午幾盤、祇八九十交易尚暢、十一十二月份竟未開、照目下粉銷沉寂而言、後步難看續俏也、結果本月份不動、九月份較好二分、十月份好三分、十一月份至一月份則不動、現麥市面、仍趨平疲、開姜堰麥三元七角、次六角四分、揚州麥三元五角二分、次四角三分、淸江麥三元七角八分、次七角三分、實應麥三元五角、次四角、瑤灣麥三元七角七分、次五角、高郵麥三元七角三分、六合麥三元五角、次四角六分、東台麥三元七角、計開八千五百包云、</p>
<h3>廠方又套出遠期粉</h3>
<p>昨粉市上下午開盤後、各月份大致平疲、以洋麥報價芝加哥仍無形停頓、坎拿大回好五六角不等、至近遠期之趨勢、本月份業外已少注目、祇各廠方面、自行抵補、因目下本街現貨喊價、均照標準别低、故客帮抽買、自然不動、因此市面遂呈擯象、遠期各月份、則因業外買氣甚寂、廠方又有套出、微見軟弱、照目下實銷、依然淸淡、恐前途仍屬疲滯之象也、結果本月份不動、九月份小二厘半、十十一月份小七厘半、十二一月份未動、</p>
<h3>河下米到稀帶緊</h3>

<p>（滬北）各帮來源三十餘號、各貨銷塲平淡、北帮白粳價小數分、薄粳及羊尖頂挺次平、杜埠尖新陳客尖平定、早稻及變元稍帶疲勢、東新更無甚上落、</p>
<h3>大連豆呆頓異常</h3>
<p>大連黃豆在本埠市塲頗佔優勢、良以交易旣比他種荳爲普及、故而市勢之轉移、亦以該荳爲目標、惟今年該荳新加運費特高、來源久絕、存底祇有二百餘車、而去路久無大胃、故市無生氣、刻下大連市又步見慘跌、至致申市更覺難於兜售、昨祇大有油廠問津、殺進二十三車、價扯四元八角二、其後情勢、尚難看立定也、</p>

<p>日人造絲銷路益暢　來日本人造絲銷路日益暢達、長江烟靑等帮銷胃最旺、月有二二千籍之銷額、是以歐美人造絲客銷、難望進展耳、　　華絲歐銷呆滯海外生絲市場、絲銷一　不振、華絲電轉寥落、且來價奇小、華絲商益　抛售、市氣呆滯、昨祇仁記等進白廠經四十包黃廠經十包、價仍平　、</p>

<h3>豆米業所用的『元』</h3>
<p>字明·</p>
<p>本埠豆業中所用的『元』字，較任何一業爲多。最著名的爲九八規元這『元』字乃是『元寳』二字之簡稱。『規』字，則與『二規二除，··』等之『規』字意義一様係『分除』的意思。換句話，就是用『九八』去除那元寶的重量成色。後來爲便於行用起見，就將『九八』二字省去，單稱『規元』，不知者正不明規元二字作何解，而不知『規』字本連在九八二字之上，作動詞用；『元』字却爲名詞也。此外商品方面，尚有</p>
<p>元豆係指東三省的黃豆而言。因東三省出産的多數大豆。粒子渾圓，和他處出産的扁形長圓不同。</p>
<p>元米指食米中的糯米，一稱變元。因其粒子變成長條圓桿，和他米之長形平扁不同。</p>
<p>元蔴芝蔴中的黑色一種。此則係從其顏色而名，和上述兩種不同了。　　元麥就是裸　　　　形狀與太麥相象，粒子則圓滑，故有此稱。但是我們看見到元麥。只覺其兩頭尖。並不像豈元米的圓。或者遠有其他原因罷！</p>

<h3>所謂『上海丸箱屍案』！</h3>
<p>— 健</p>
<p>近來本埠各報對於所謂『上海丸箱屍案』，都登着大字標題，佔了長篇幅，其重視可想而知。</p>
<p>日本官廳，尤其十分賣力；從發現以來，經過了幾次三番的化騐，還去驚動英·法兩租界的警務當局。據說『因一屍體而致國際上探捕全部動員，在上海尚爲創見。』其關係重大，自然意在言外。</p>
<p>在日領事署警務人員斷定那女屍是陳巧英的當兒，中間忽跳出個『面目娟好』的陳巧英來，親　跑到日領事署去，用『極流利之日語』證明她尚在人問，並且乘便附帶聲明她祇有愛友三人，並無超過四十的話；又恐機會難得，時乎不再，就此和佐藤刑事部長（？）合攝一影，以留紀念。這　幕外喜劇，更演來有聲有色，動人觀聽。</p>
<p>但此案的内容究竟如何呢？據報載已『水落石出』了。如其確實的話，也不過如此，如此而已：『兇手·····葡國無賴少年，被害的·····廣東美麗女子········愛好·····决裂·····移屍赴日』。</p>
<p>案中情節，何等平淡無奇！案内人物，又何等庸俗卑劣！怎値得那般小題大做，驚开動地呢？</p>
<p>然而，日警方面倒忙得不亦樂乎，所爲何事呢？我想，那無非玩老把戲，借此幌子，又來一次宣傳作用，表示大日本帝國的警務高明，不肯無視人命罷了。</p>
<p>讓我們的視綫來換一個方向，作較深的觀察：</p>
<p>自『九一八』『一二八』直到『塘沽恊定』，我國同胞，慘遭日軍無辜逮捕，任意殘殺，名爲失踪案件，不知多少起。朝鮮革命份子，因政治運動，釀成冤獄，每年被日人暗中捕殺的，也指不勝屈。年來日本資産階級的統治者軍閥，財閥，採取風靡一時的法西欺蒂主義，摧殘革命靑年，暗殺左傾學者，已成了公開的秘密。</p>
<p>這些慘無人道的『莫須有』冤獄，日本警察當局，何曾出力偵查，使案情大白於天下？决沒有這麽一回事！祇有這次『箱屍案』特别起勁，眞是察秋毫而不見輿薪，輕重倒置。這不是分明在投烟幕彈嗎？</p>
<p>你想罷：把那許多無頭案來比這『箱屍案』，簡直是『九牛一毛，滄海一粟』，算得什麽：况且被害的份子内，有許多多具着優秀的天才，卓越的思想，犧牲的精神，又豈是一個浪漫女子所堪比擬！何以輕彼重此？</p>
<p>再退一步講：此案縱算昭雪了，也至多祇能處兇手以徒刑或死刑，徒足增加個人的苦痛，或多死一人；决不能使死者復生，或『無賴少年』變成有志之士；也絕對不能擔保類此的第三案。第三案，第······案不再繼續發生！　　『箱屍案』是現社會制度之下所腐生的恒河沙數中的一枚細小病菌而已。</p>
<h3>『裸體誦經』</h3>
<p>— 白璧</p>
<p>申報八日徐州專電云：『海訊。贛榆白石頭村發現秘密集會，晚間集男女於一室，裸體誦經。舉動猥褻。無知男女。入會甚多。』</p>
<p>這大概可算是一節『極妙的趣聞』吧！大堪玩味。但可惜我已沒有雅興來研究他們入會的男女究竟是『怎様集合？怎様裸體？怎様誦經？怎様猥褻？』了，眞是不勝遺憾之至！</p>
<p>但我會聯想，聯想到『正經』上去。　　其一是：『裸體附帶誦經』，</p>
<p>男女社員身上一絲不掛的作日光浴，口中唸『色即是空空即是色』的經咒。使反對猥褻的裸體運動的先生們不致整個反對，至少『整個之半面』不會反對聖潔的『誦經運動』。這不是拆散了反對者的陣線嗎，提倡裸體運動的『野　人』，大可投機一下。</p>
<p>其二是：『裸體反對讀經』　　在課堂裏，男女學子，大家把衣服脫光，同時打起特有的腔調，奉命一『讀經』。彰明較著的反對『讀經』萬萬及不上這個幽默舉動來得有力，南國靑年，何妨一試！</p>
<p>這個問題談到這裏，我覺得我的聯想太『撒野』了，『閉口大吉』！</p>
<h3>五分鐘的轉變</h3>
<p>— 鑑因</p>
<p>她是個貧弱的少婦，她的丈夫病倒了。家中的日常生活，都靠丈夫賣水菓度日，在熱天之下，她的丈夫被征服了！</p>
<p>『噯！醫藥費倒不要緊，可是要吃飯的呀！』丈夫的話。</p>
<p>『我去鄰舍處借幾個錢來再說·』　　『·····』他點點頭，表示這是沒有辦法的辦法。</p>
<p>她又立在他的面前了，帶着慘淡的神情說：</p>
<p>『大家都口口聲聲訴苦，簡直連一個銅板也借不到！』</p>
<p>『唉！這···』</p>
<p>『我想拿幾件衣服去當當看！』</p>
<p>『又沒有好衣服？』</p>
<p>『我做新嫁娘時，帶來的幾件旗袍倒還新鮮，』</p>
<p>『去試試，病好了馬上贖回來。』</p>
<p>她檢出了四年前老式的旗袍，三件忍痛地包在報紙裏，怱怱地走出了門外，很怯懼地鑽進當舖裏。顫抖着的手，將紙包遞上，她馬上暗想：</p>
<p>『這會可有一二塊白洋錢到手了，』　　『這種陳年老貨，也來當嗎？眞是笑話！』店員帶着鐵靑的面孔，向她看了一眼，將紙包一推，進去了。</p>
<p>『就是當幾角也可以呀！』</p>
<p>『·····』裏面沒有答·</p>
<p>她走進當舖及離開當舖，中間不到五分鐘。她受了一種剌激，於是神經錯亂了。她唱着歌，向前走，許多閒人跟在她後面看熱鬧。她走進自己的家裏，認不淸丈夫：但是她的丈夫，看她的眼角上·還有很深的涙痕掛着。</p>
<p>數日後，他抬進××醫院，而她却在瘋人院了·</p>

<p>(Xuzhou) Road News: The Yellow River waters attacked Dingtao, threatening to submerge it. Han Fuju ordered the people to be moved to Jining for temporary shelter, and then transported to Jinan by armored vehicles to alleviate the crisis. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) The Yellow River water has entered the Jiangsu territory at Dangshan. The provincial government urgently telegraphed Tongshan and more than ten other counties to speed up defenses day and night, and telegraphed water conservancy experts Han Guojun and Xu Dingkang to come to the province to discuss relief measures. Wu Tongju was also sent to Beijing to meet with the Huai River Diversion Committee to discuss everything and request a quick decision. (16th Special Dispatch)  (Xuzhou) The Yellow River breached its banks in western Shandong and has entered its old course, rushing towards the lower reaches of northern Jiangsu. Many of the old dikes along the river have been destroyed, and the riverbed is more than ten feet higher than both banks. The Xuzhou-Huaiyin area is in danger of being flooded, especially Xuzhou City, which is surrounded by the river on three sides, is located in a low-lying area, and whose city walls have been demolished and dikes damaged, losing all protection. Once the flood surges, Xuzhou City is in imminent danger of submersion. Therefore, the people of Xuzhou Prefecture are fearful of the Yellow River's return to its old course. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Yellow River's old course has raging waters. As of the evening of the 16th, it has crossed the borders of Dangshan and Fengxian counties for forty to fifty li. The head of the water has reached Huangkou, heading straight for Xuzhou. The military and civilians of Xuzhou rushed to protect the dikes at 4 PM on the 16th, first focusing on the dangerous breaches from the Chengnan Duanzhuang to the North Gate section, constructing dike works day and night. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)  (Xuzhou) Yang Liang, the magistrate of Fengxian County, telegraphed Xuzhou at 4 PM on the 16th, stating that the Yellow River water was flowing eastward along the old course, already reaching Zhou Sai, with the head of the water being one li wide and five chi deep, and the rear five li wide and over one zhang deep. The water's speed is about seventy li per day. Yang is supervising the construction to raise the embankments and forts, and has also reported to the Jiangsu Provincial Government. Additionally, Dangshan reported via telephone that the Yellow River water had overflowed its old course and flowed eastward, having crossed Zhouzhai and about to reach Xuzhou imminently. Feng and Dang counties have already bricked up the city gates with earth to prevent water from entering the city. Xuzhou has no city defenses, so they can only protect the river forts for now. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)  (Zhengzhou) Liu Zhi received a report from the magistrate of Kaocheng County that the water inside the county seat was five feet deep and the county government had relocated to Hezhuang to conduct business. The water inside the prison was especially deep. Guards were dispatched to escort the prisoners to the city walls, and more than forty people escaped or drowned. The county government's files were completely submerged and ruined. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The magistrate of Caoxian County telegraphed that the breach of the Yellow River in Ji and Yu provinces meant that the county was the first to bear the brunt. Villages within ten li of the county seat were surrounded by water on the west, south, and north sides, with the water reaching three to five feet deep in the flatlands. The water flow was scattered, making it extremely difficult to defend against. The magistrate of Heze County telegraphed that after torrential rains all night on the 14th, the water level suddenly increased, and the newly built dikes all collapsed. The magistrate went down to the villages to protect against the flood, wading through water to return to the city. The northwest and southwest parts of the city had become a vast swamp. The county seat had been surrounded by water and was spreading across the northern part of the county, flowing eastward towards Kaocheng. The water from the Yellow River breach also invaded the southern border, creating a very dangerous situation. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Wang Xizhen, the magistrate of Shanxian County, telegraphed that after the Yellow River breached at Lanfeng, the water had reached Yucheng at the Laojunzhai area where the three counties of Cao, Shan, and others met, reaching a depth of one zhang, five or six chi. It was flowing east along the old course of the Tongwaxiang River from seventy years ago before the breach, but has not yet left the channel. However, the water continues to rise to a depth of three zhang and a width of one to three li, showing a great tendency to return to its old course. If defenses are not erected, all the counties in western Shandong will be affected. Please send river conservancy specialists to supervise the construction of defenses. In addition, the breach at Changyuan has allowed water to reach Shouzhang, with a width of two hundred fifty to sixty meters. It continues to rise and has left the channel, flowing down violently. The north bank's large dike has not seen water for many years and is very dangerous. The River Bureau urgently telegraphed the magistrates of the counties along the river and officials in each section to strictly defend against the water, regardless of wind, rain, day or night. Please provide urgent relief to the counties in western Shandong that have been flooded. Han Yun said that construction of houses should be prioritized after the water recedes. The water level in the North Grand Canal has already started to fall. (16th Special Dispatch)  (Xuzhou) The Yellow River water that flooded south from Caozhou reached Dangshan on the 16th and entered the Yellow River's old course. The Xuzhou water police suddenly reported an emergency. Garrison Commander Zeng Wanzhong urgently telegraphed the 7th Division stationed in Dangshan to coordinate with local forces in rescue operations. Special Commissioner She Nianci separately telegraphed Feng, Dang, and Xiao to block the water. The military and government in Xuzhou have implemented rescue and dike repair work. She himself went to the city's ring dike to inspect and repair it. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Yellow River water from Caozhou flowed south of Shanxian and reached Dangshan on the 16th, flowing into the old course of the Yellow River, with the head of the water reaching four to five chi. It is continuing to flow eastward. Upon receiving the report, the Xuzhou Garrison Command dispatched a regiment from the 7th Division to repair the old city ring dike for defense. The 88th Division stationed in Xuzhou also drew two battalions to repair sections of the dike. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Fengxian telegraphed on the afternoon of the 16th that the Yellow River water had reached Zhouzhai, with the head of the water being five chi high and one li wide, and the rear being over one zhang high and five li wide. The speed is about seventy Chinese li per day. They are rushing to build up the Zhaizhai embankment and have telegraphed Pei County to send workers to assist. (16th Special Dispatch)  (Xuzhou) Dangshan reported by telephone on the afternoon of the 16th that the Yellow River water had reached less than ten li north of Dangcheng, with the head of the water being five chi high. It flowed from Caozhou. The water contains corpses, livestock, utensils, and miscellaneous objects, which has slightly reduced the speed of the water flow. County Magistrate Ren Naigeng is supervising the masses to repair dikes and engage in rescue operations. Furthermore, Fengxian reported by telephone that the Yellow River water is forty li away from Fengcheng. Fengyi has mobilized 10,000 workers to build barriers. The dikes of Xiao County near the river are also being repaired. (16th Special Dispatch)  (Xuzhou) This area has repeatedly received telegrams from the Jiangsu Province on the 15th and 16th, stating that the Yellow River water is flooding south from Lu Cao Yu Kao, and urging that defenses be quickly planned. Also, the dikes on both sides of the abandoned Yellow River Canal and Weishan Lake should be urgently repaired by gathering laborers and patrolling day and night for protection. Caozhou telegraphed on the 16th that the Yellow River water is surging and besieging the city. Telegrams outside the city cannot be delivered, the postal services have been suspended, the Dongming line is blocked and cannot be repaired, and telegrams to the east are being refused. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The Beiyun River in Wucheng has risen steeply by six chi and eight cun in three days, exceeding the highest flood level by one chi and three cun, and is still rising. The Yellow River's breach on the north bank of Changyuan has now reached Zhangqingying in Fan County, 18 li from the county seat. The water is flowing under the dike. The channel is about forty to fifty meters wide and one meter and six or seven deep. Currently, the Yellow River in this province has no major increases or decreases. The water level at Luokou is 28.75 meters. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The Longhai Railway reported on the evening of the 16th that the Yellow River water had reached between Feng and Dang, flowing eastward. However, it seemed to be overflowing and flowing horizontally, failing to fully follow the old course of the Yellow River. Traffic is still unimpeded. The old dikes of Xufu are being urgently repaired from the western section. Upon inspection, the old dikes here have long been destroyed and the city has been demolished. If the Yellow River water overflows, the city will be in great danger. At present, there is a tendency to attack Xuzhou. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Gu Zhutong said that since the Yellow River's violent surge and diversion into the Huai River has caused the river water to overflow to Lanfeng, it will be difficult to defend whether it enters Jiangsu via the old course or enters the Huai via the Anhui route, and the people will suffer a great calamity. In order to quickly find ways to defend against the flood, he specially telegraphed the Huai River Diversion Committee to request the National Government to dispatch a special commissioner to manage the matter. The National Government ordered the Yellow River Conservancy Commission to send personnel to preside over the engineering work. The commission has already sent Xu Xinwu to handle the matter, departing from the 16th. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The Yellow River Conservancy Commission has dispatched Zhang Hanying to Henan to inspect the breach. The commission is scheduled to meet in Kaifeng on September 25th. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Dangshan telegraphed on the morning of the 16th that the Yellow River breach in the Heze area of western Shandong has caused raging waters, with the head of the water reaching about one zhang in height. It is rushing towards the Jiangsu border from western Shandong and has flowed into the old course of the Yellow River, with the head of the water reaching about five chi. On the morning of the 16th, it surged in, reaching more than ten li from Dangcheng, carrying sand, mud, firewood, livestock, bricks, gravel, and other objects, making the situation extremely turbulent. The people of Dangshan are panic-stricken. County Magistrate Ren Naigeng is leading 10,000 laborers to urgently repair dikes for protection. The water in the old course is currently 40 li from Fengxian. County Magistrate Yang Liang is also leading 20,000 laborers to urgently protect the old dikes. The situation in northern Jiangsu has suddenly become critical. Upon receiving the report, Xuzhou Garrison Commander Zeng Wanzhong urgently dispatched a regiment from the 7th Division and two battalions from the 88th Division at noon on the 16th to rush to the Fen embankment north of Xuzhou to build barriers at the dangerous gaps. Administrative Commissioner Yu Nianci personally went to the old dike north of the city in the afternoon to inspect the situation and immediately supervised the soldiers and laborers to jointly repair the river dike. At the same time, he ordered residents in the city and countryside to contribute laborers and first prioritize repairing the Yellow River dike surrounding Xuzhou in order to address the emergency. (16th Central News Agency) (Beiping) The Catholic Father of Caozhou telegraphed the Beijing Disaster Relief Committee, stating that the Yellow River breach had submerged an area 50 li long and 20 li wide in Dongning Caozhou. Crops, except for sorghum, were destroyed. The Father believes that the water in western Shandong will become even more severe. (16th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>After the Fall of Dolon</p>
<h3>We Submit Negotiations to Japan</h3>
<p>Japanese Reply is Strong and Distorted</p>
<p>No Intention to Transfer the Troop</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the Japanese and puppet troops recaptured Dolon, our side decided to lodge representations with the Japanese side through diplomatic channels, requesting Japan to respect the truce agreement and pay attention to peace, and immediately hand over the defense of Dolon. A informal statement had been delivered some days ago, but no reply had been received from the Japanese side as of the present. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chai Shan has replied to He, mainly saying that Li Shouxin's army was originally stationed in Dolon, but was driven out by Feng's army and fled to Rehe. Now that they have recaptured it, it is to maintain the local security, because the area is still rampant with communist bandits, which obviously threatens the security of Rehe. Therefore, there is no intention to transfer the unit elsewhere immediately. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Secret Activities of Traitors</h3>
<p>Liu Jinbiao Organizes the Mind Association</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Liu Jinbiao, the former head of the puppet Political Affairs Department, is currently organizing the Mind Advancement Association in the counties of eastern and western Luan, which is a large traitorous group. The general office is located in Yuguan, and branch offices are widespread in various counties and towns. The leader in Tangshan is Wang Enpu, who has received 8,000 yuan for activities. Zheng Yanhou, the former front-line commander of Li Jichun's army, has reached an agreement with the Kwantung Army. Zheng has arrived in Chaoyang, recruiting bandits to create disturbances in the interior. The rumor that Zheng is the chief of secret agents is not accurate. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Wang Delin Expresses</p>
<h3>Still Willing to Fight the Enemy to the Death</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Wang Delin has established an office in Guangdong, with expenses of 1,000 yuan per month allocated by Guangdong. Wang said that there are still 80,000 of his former troops scattered in eastern Jilin and eastern Yanbian. He is determined to return north within days to reorganize the anti-Japanese front and fight the enemy to the death. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Receiving Yuguan is Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>Japanese Plan a Buffer Zone</p>
<p>Japanese Army Has No Intention to Withdraw from the Great Wall Line</p>
<p>Japanese Army in Tangyu Stationed in Sections for Long-Term Defense</p>
<p>(Tangshan) The issue of receiving Yuguan is still under negotiation. It will be difficult to relocate Linyu County for the time being. The Japanese garrison army in Tianjin has divided the troops on the Beining Line between Tangshan and Yuguan into two sections for long-term defense. Luanzhou to Yuguan is the responsibility of Major Luhe, and Tangshan to Luanzhou is the responsibility of Major Asami. (16th Special Dispatch)  (Beiping) Since Liu Shisun negotiated with the Japanese side on the matter of receiving Yuguan, because there are many puppet state organs in Yuguan city, first the Japanese side must order them to be canceled or withdrawn outside the Guan. Before these pseudo organizations are canceled, it will be inconvenient for our side to take over. There are still a small number of Japanese troops in Yuguan city, who have not yet withdrawn. At the same time, the Japanese side has re-demarcated a buffer zone between Yuguan and Shihe. Our side is negotiating with them, and it is expected that the reception of Yuguan will take place in eight or nine days. The Japanese army has established a supply station and a small number of guard troops in Luanxian, because during the transportation conference last month, the Japanese side claimed that the land transportation of supplies to the Rehe garrison was difficult, and requested our side to allow them to transport them from the Fengshan Road of the puppet state to Luanxian, and then transfer them to Rehe by waterway. At that time, the Japanese side also designated three places, including Shaqiao town in Luanxian, as grain transfer stations, intending to transport sufficient supplies before the river freezes in order to survive the winter. Therefore, the withdrawal of the Japanese troops in Luanxian and other places must wait until after the river freezes. Whether the passes of the Great Wall will be recovered in the future remains to be negotiated with the Japanese side. The reception of Zunhua has been completed, and Li Zeyi returned south yesterday. All reception matters in the war zone are presided over by Yin Tong, who is staying in Beiping.  (Beiping) Yin Tong said that Xinglong County protrudes beyond the Great Wall, and the reception of that place and Dushan has not yet been completed. There are more than 70 passes, large and small, on the Great Wall line from Yuguan to Gubeikou. All the major passes are in the hands of the Japanese army. Because the Great Wall has a glorious historical relationship in China, our side is now trying to persuade the Japanese side to withdraw and reorganize the puppet army to restore transportation. Li Zeyi has gone to Nanjing, and I am responsible for all liaison matters. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Feng Yuxiang Staying Briefly in Jinan</h3>
<p>Deng Zhexi and Others Go to Mount Tai First to Arrange Accommodation</p>
<p>The Five Worthies Temple Has Been Surveyed as Feng's Lodging Place</p>
<p>(Beiping) Han Fuju telegraphed Jiang Bocheng, saying that Feng intended to stay in Jinan for two or three days to rest, and the entourage had gone to Mount Tai to make arrangements. Zhang Zizhong returned to Yangquan today to guard and inspect his troops. (16th Special Dispatch)  (Jinan) Feng Yuxiang's special train arrived in Dezhou at 10:20 this morning. Li Hanzhang, the commander of the 74th Division stationed in Dezhou, led his troops to welcome him at the station. Feng got off the train. Because many of Li's troops were Feng's old troops, Feng inspected them for a long time and praised them. At 11:20, the special train departed south from Dezhou. Reporters boarded the train in Dezhou to visit Feng. Feng said that the military and political affairs have been fully handed over to Song. From the beginning, I made a pact to not point the gun inwards and to arm and protect the border. Now, the lost territory of Chahar Province has been recovered, and not a single shot has been fired internally. The anti-Japanese troops in Chahar who followed me numbered about 110,000, with thousands of casualties. Temples have been built, monuments erected, and graves constructed for them. A public case has been roughly concluded. Dolon is still in the hands of Ji Hongchang's troops. I will go to Taian to rest for a while, and may get off the train in Jinan to see the sights. Because Jiang and Wang telegraphed an invitation, I am still preparing to go to Nanjing for a visit, but the time is uncertain. There are still plans for resisting Japan in the future, and I will talk about it when the time comes. As the train approached the Yellow River, Feng sighed by the window, saying, "Beautiful Yellow River, I wonder if it will still be in our country's territory this time next year. I also wonder if Mount Tai will still be able to provide me with shelter next year." At 2:15, they arrived in Jinan. More than 100 people from all walks of life in the party, government, and military welcomed him. Flags were hung throughout the city, and guards were stationed from the station to the provincial government. Feng got off the train, shook hands with the welcomers one by one, patted Zheng Jicheng on the shoulder on the platform, and gave him a thumbs up, saying "Good job!" He rode in a car with Han to the provincial government. He met with his old subordinates in Han's office and had a pleasant conversation with Han. Han and Feng ate together, four dishes and one soup. Han invited Feng to stay for a while, but Feng decided to go to Mount Tai first. At 5:00, Deng Zhexi, Li Qi, Zhang Jiyong, and others took a special train to Taian to arrange accommodation, probably still at Puzhao Temple. In the train, Feng talked a lot, mainly advocating resistance, with many sad and angry words, saying that when the Jilin-Heilongjiang troops arrived in Chahar, they were still suffering in cotton-padded clothes and fur hats. I spoke for the loss of Northeast and Rehe, all wept loudly, vowing to recover the lost territory. It can be seen that the people of the country all want to save the country, as long as someone inspires them. If you make excuses that military equipment and military strength are inferior, and do not resist, I am afraid that there will be danger north of the Yangtze River. What are the real results of this anti-Japanese resistance? I hope the people of the country will judge it with their conscience. (15th Special Dispatch)  (Jinan) Feng Yuxiang's three special trains were delayed because the order of priority was switched along the way. The first train arrived in Dezhou at 11:00, and it is expected to arrive in Jinan at about 2:00 PM. Here, preparations are being made to welcome him, and the station is heavily guarded. Only those with badges are allowed to enter. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Deng Zhexi and others returned to Jinan from Taian today. According to them, the Five Worthies Temple has been surveyed as Feng's residence, and the attendants and guards will be housed in Guandi Temple, Wangmu Pond, and Puzhao Temple. At 4:00 PM, Han hosted Feng at the Dongda Building, sitting on the floor, with a plate of gourd, a plate of salted tea, and a plate of vegetarian dishes for each person, totaling more than 50 people. Today, Jiang telegraphed Han to inquire about Feng. Feng plans to visit Daming Lake on the 16th and then go to Taian. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) This morning, Han and Feng visited Thousand Buddha Mountain, the sports field, Black Tiger Spring, and the swimming pool. They returned to the provincial government for breakfast at 7:00 AM. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Successful Trial Flight on the Shanghai-Philippines Route</h3>
<p>Departed from Hong Kong Yesterday Morning and Arrived at Destination at 3:30 PM</p>
<p>Philippine Governor's Representative, Mayor, etc. All Came to Welcome</p>
<p>Survey Results Showed That It Was Suitable for Commercial Use</p>
<p>It Is Necessary to Set Up a Stopover Station in Labrado, North Luzon</p>
<p>(Manila) The trial flight of the China National Aviation Corporation's airplane between Shanghai and Manila has been completely successful, and it safely landed on the waters near the Army and Navy Club at 3:31 PM today. Except for the section from Labrado to this place, where visibility was poor due to rain, the rest of the weather was suitable for flying. The people here gathered on the beach, looking into the distance for the arrival of the airplane. Only about 50 people greeted it at the landing site. After the representatives of the Pacific Aviation Corporation, Pikespeck and the pilot Gloweske stepped out of the plane, Deputy Governor Halliday, representing Governor Murphy, was the first to offer his congratulations. The rest of the welcome committee members, including Manila Mayor An Ensu, US Commercial Commissioner Heste, and the Governor's Aviation Advisor Morgan, then crowded around Pike and Gloweske and headed to the Army and Navy Club to rest and dine. Although this was their first survey, based on the experience gained, they believed that the Shanghai-Hong Kong-Manila commercial airline route was technically feasible. The sections of the route were short and suitable for commercial conditions. In the future, when starting scheduled flights, it may be necessary to set up stopover and refueling stations in North Luzon and Labrado. The short flight and small fuel load will allow for carrying more passengers and mail. It is expected that Lake Pulai in North Luzon could be used as a stopover point. This time, it was originally planned to use a small boat to transport gasoline in Labrado Bay, but when they arrived at the bay at 12:30, they could not find the oil tanker. Therefore, they landed on the water and drove along the shore. Later, they met Philippine newspaper reporters Victoriano and Teodoro Asiw, who guided them to the small town of Lingayen to add fuel, and departed at 2:20. The two newspaper reporters became the first passengers and rode together to Manila. It rained frequently on this section of the road, and visibility was poor, but flying was still not difficult.</p>
<p>The plane departed from Hong Kong at 5:40 AM this morning and passed Dongsha Island at 7:45 AM. Dongsha Island is about 200 miles from Hong Kong and is also a place where you can stop on the way, but it did not land this trip. It then arrived at the coast of Luzon at 11:00 AM. The plane traveled excellently. This trip was for the Pacific Aviation Corporation to survey the route. The company is an affiliate of the United Airlines. (16th National News Agency)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) At 5:45 this morning, the Shanghai-Fiji trial flight plane again took off from Hong Kong with Pikesbeck and others heading straight for the Philippines. Two hours later, the plane had passed the Polletas Islands between Hong Kong and the northern tip of Luzon. The plane carries pilot Gloweske, co-pilot Imer, a radio operator, and passenger Ronmill. Their trip may be a prelude to the establishment of a Shanghai-America flight route via the Philippines. (16th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Build Manila Fortress</h3>
<p>Workers Use Life-Sentenced Prisoners</p>
<p>According to the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun, the U.S. military authorities have recently been expanding the Manila Fortress in the utmost secrecy. The U.S. authorities in Manila have recently purchased a large amount of cement from the Japanese Mitsui Yoko, and the purpose of this has now been clarified. The extent to which the U.S. authorities will expand the fortress is currently difficult to ascertain. The report also stated that if the U.S. move becomes a reality, it will be a blatant violation of the Washington Agreement, and its meaning is a naked war against Japan, containing extremely serious significance. It has also been learned that the U.S. authorities are using their own life-sentenced prisoners to carry out this work. Recently, one of the prisoners was leaked to escape, and this news was spread.</p>

(16th Japan United News)  (Tokyo) The Ministry of the Navy announced that the Japanese Emperor boarded the "Hiei" warship at 8:30 this morning and departed from Yokosuka naval port at 9:00 am, setting sail for the exercise site. The confrontation exercise between the Qing and Akagumi armies personally supervised by the Japanese Emperor began at midnight this morning. At dawn, the two armies had local clashes. Because Hachijo Island is an isolated island on the sea, the islanders automatically organized a defense group to participate in the exercise and effectively reported the appearance of enemy ships.

<h3>German Air Defense Exercise</h3>
<p>(Berlin) In the first step of defending against aerial attacks here, all the goods stored in the upper-level warehouses of the city's houses will be removed. There are specially appointed air defense officials who go to the residential houses to check the warehouses and discuss the arrangements with the homeowners in order to remove flammable materials such as old furniture, wooden beds, and wooden boxes. After counting, a list is drawn up, and then special personnel are set up in each residential house to guard them, and special fire-fighting personnel are added. Whenever aircraft bombs cause a fire, the guards at the location will notify the fire-fighting personnel to go and extinguish it. Underground shelters have also been set up inside the mountains of some residential houses. (15th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The People of the Nation Should Know Self-Respect</h3>
<p>Zi</p>
<p>For half a month, there have been rumors that former President Xu Shichang secretly went to the Northeast. Later, facts proved that Mr. Xu was still in Tianjin, enjoying his life of calligraphy and painting. The rumors died down on their own. Northern newspapers took this opportunity to write articles praising Mr. Xu's self-love and patriotism, criticizing the giants who have been fighting each other internally and the military strategists with excessive political desires in recent years. We believe that for those of Mr. Xu's age and environment, self-love is enough. But for those who are full of vigor and flaunt their talents, they should be held accountable for self-respect. Self-love means to maintain one's integrity and stay out of trouble, which is not something to talk about to middle-aged people who are full of vigor, eager to move, and rely on their talents to try. The meaning of self-respect is to respect one's own personality, which is enough to govern the behavior of those involved in political activities and prevent them from entering the wrong path of harming the country. In recent years, there have been quite a few people who are full of vigor, eager to move, and rely on their talents to try because of political relations. Telling these people to maintain their integrity and stay out of trouble is not only useless, but also too far from their level of cultivation. Telling them to respect their own personality may slightly restrain their behavior.</p>
<p>Speaking from the facts, even if the national crisis is extremely serious, unless the government is well-governed and the world is in harmony, it will be difficult to completely eliminate domestic political activities. Trying to force it is only futile. However, on the other hand, those engaged in political activities must examine their own personality. In today's environment of thin ice and deep abyss, a slight misstep can unintentionally be used by the enemy to increase the danger to the country. At the same time, one's own personality will also be questioned. Feng Yuxiang reined in his horse at the edge of the cliff, stopped his local actions, and suddenly went to Shandong for recuperation. Was he aware of this meaning and had some realization?</p>
<p>Extending this meaning to a broader discussion, the theory of self-respect still has its applicable aspects. Recently, the Tokyo correspondent of the Millard's Review described several kinds of pseudo-friendly remarks by the Japanese, advocating friendship with China for the sake of Asia and shouting wildly not to allow China to be invaded by foreign forces. Those who know a little about the content of the Monroe Doctrine in East Asia will immediately see their intentions. The more seductive ones, such as the proposal to help consolidate China, the metaphor of a coin with two sides, and the theory of a powerful government, are sincerely discussed and deeply hidden their effects beyond the creation of new ideas. However, in fact, if China has a consolidated government to rule a vast territory and a large population, it will become a world power even stronger than Japan. Is this what Japan, which claims to be the leader of Asia, wants? Here, we can understand the malice in the sweet words of the Japanese. Knowledgeable people will certainly not mistakenly believe their words and fall into their trap. If they do, they will only harm themselves and harm the country. This is why self-respect is valued.</p>
<p>Soviet Russia Stipulates</p>
<h3>Tomorrow is Air Defense Day</h3>
<p>National Air Force to Conduct Exercises</p>
<p>Moscow National Telegram, 15th August. The Moscow government has ordered August 18th to be Soviet Russia's Air Defense Day. Celebrations will be held throughout the country, with factories and schools closed on that day to allow workers and students to participate in the celebrations and to make the people aware of the importance of air defense. All Soviet Russian aircraft will conduct exercises on this day, centered on Leningrad and the Ural region, and will extend to the Far East. Newspapers have paid great attention to this move, as Japan has also scheduled to hold air exercises in Manchuria on this day (15th National Telegram).</p>

<h3>Short-Term Fast in Prison</h3>
<p>Demanding Continued Work for Millions of Untouchables</p>
<p>Indian Government Finally Grants Request Under Certain Conditions</p>
<p>Congress Acting President Anni Sentenced to Six Months Imprisonment</p>
<p>Poona Gandhi, after demanding complete rights for national criminals, has again begun fasting this afternoon. Gandhi was re-detained on August 4th for refusing to comply with the order restricting his activities after his release from prison. Gandhi admitted to deliberately violating government orders. Although he advocates peace, he has no choice but to disobey this order, so the court sentenced him to one year of imprisonment. Today, he declared a hunger strike to the death. (Sixteenth day, Reuters telegram) Bombay Many believe that Gandhi's hunger strike can be averted if the government allows him to continue to preach for the untouchables. Currently, Gandhi is only eating one meal. Anni, the acting president of the Indian National Congress, was detained on Sunday and has now been sentenced to six months imprisonment for participating in the passive resistance movement (Sixteenth day, Reuters telegram). Poona Gandhi issued a statement this morning in Yeravda Jail, declaring that if he is not allowed to continue working for millions of untouchables in India, then he does not wish to continue living in the world, and will rather starve to death. He then began his hunger strike at noon, but at 3 p.m., because the Indian government had allowed him to continue his efforts for the untouchables under certain conditions, Gandhi stopped his hunger strike.

<p>US Economic Policy and its Impact on the Far East</p>
<p>As the Focus of Discussion</p>
<p>Peng Fu's Round Table Conference of the Pacific Society today focused on discussing whether the results of the U.S. economic recovery movement might lead to economic conflict in the Far East. In addition, the restriction of production, especially the restriction of agricultural products, was also discussed for a long time. Chinese and Japanese representatives suggested a significant reduction in wheat production, and asked for attention to the situation of wheat dumping in the Far East. Representatives from all parties said that the rapid industrialization of the Far East will soon close the market to surplus goods from the West. Even Western representatives seemed to acknowledge this. (Fifteenth day, National Telegram)</p>

<h3>Enters Second Stage</h3>
<p>Disputes over Wages and Working Hours Continue</p>
<p>Difficulties in Handling by Authorities</p>
<p>Garment Industry Strikes in Three States including New York</p>
<p>(New York) The national recovery movement aimed at restoring American prosperity has now entered its second stage, and the difficulties encountered by the government are increasing. For example, basic industries such as oil, iron, steel, and coal are still disputing over working hours and wage regulations. President Roosevelt is now actively trying to use the Supreme Recovery Administration Council to regulate the forces that are in stalemate. Today, the administrative council discussed various methods, including ordering boys and girls who have recently left school to return to school in order to alleviate the severe unemployment situation. At the same time, 60,000 garment industry workers in the three states of New York, Jersey, and Connecticut are now threatening to strike to demand better wages and shorter working hours.

<h3>Cursing Modern Civilization</h3>
<p>Machines Make All Life Tense</p>
<p>The Increase in American Insanity is Proof</p>
<p>Wisconsin - According to Dr. Huthai, there is now a disease that attacks modern life, which can be called "Americanitis." This disease is caused by speed, hope, and noise. In the machine age, the fastest can survive, so all life becomes tense. This tension of modern life can be proven by the fact that although the disease and mortality rates among the American people have decreased, insanity has increased. If a person's nervous system is as strong as iron and the same as the organization of a machine, then we do not have to object to the efficiency of modern industry. However, the fragility of a person's nervous organization is almost the same as that of thin Dresden porcelain. Under unnatural tension, or subjected to rough handling, there is no one that will not break. In the past, when people were afraid of noise, others would tell them, "You'll get used to it after a while." However, according to recent research, noise is a hazard to health, and it has been firmly proven. (World News Agency)</p>
<p>(Washington) The US Industrial Recovery Administration encountered two tricky issues today, and major industrialists and bankers across the country are paying close attention to the development of future events. One is that a major steel company refused to attend the meeting convened by Johnson, the supervisor of the Recovery Administration, to discuss labor issues. On the other hand, the strike of 2,500 garment seamstresses in New York has the potential to evolve into a general strike of women's garment workers tomorrow. Personnel from the Administration are currently engaged in mediation, but there have been no results as of tonight. The steel company has not stated its reasons. It is heard that some leaders believe that the industrial regulations will lead to the total combination of all workers. Some also say that the initial purpose of the industrial regulations was only to stipulate the minimum wage and the maximum working hours, but now it has evolved into an extremely complex issue, leading the government into an infinite state of confusion. The great garment seamstresses rose up because they were dissatisfied with their treatment. In addition, managing the price of retail goods is also the third difficult issue for the Recovery Administration. It is reported that some manufacturers are secretly combining to raise prices above the proper price, but Johnson has declared that he will not hesitate to stipulate prices when necessary. (Fifteenth day, National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) After the American steel industry resisted the government plan, it has softened today, and two of its most important leaders have arrived in Washington to participate in the meeting at Johnson's call. (Fifteenth day, National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Cuban Political Tide Ends</h3>
<p>New Government Has Obtained Recognition from the Diplomatic Corps</p>
<p>US Marines Remain Stationed in the Country to Prevent Incidents</p>
<p>(Washington) The U.S. government believes that the overthrow of the Cuban Machado government and the emergence of a new president have ended the political tide, so all talk of intervention is now off the table. Today, General Stanley sent Lieutenant Colonel Sturtevant to Guantanamo, only to command the Marines there, to be summoned when needed by the new Cuban president. Guantanamo is the naval coal port leased by the United States in Cuba. (Fifteenth day, National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull declared that the change in the Cuban political situation is only that Machado resigned and Dr. Cespedes is acting as president, and there is no change in the current republican system, so the United States has absolutely no need to re-recognize the new Cuban government. Hull also said that the situation in Cuba is improving rapidly, and the entire island has returned to tranquility. (Fifteenth day, Havas telegram) Havana It is heard that the new government led by acting President Cespedes will be recognized by the United States without any difficulty, because the new government obtained power in accordance with constitutional procedures, and even former President Machado recognized this. Today, the Spanish ambassador, in his capacity as chairman of the diplomatic corps, convened a meeting of representatives from various countries. The views of the ambassadors were the same as those of the United States. Mexico and Italy have already recognized the new government from now on. (Fifteenth day, Havas telegram)</p>
<h3>The Difficult Task of Reorganizing Debt</h3>
<p>Havana Acting President Cespedes's most difficult and urgent task is to find a way to reduce the huge public debt left by former President Machado. This is one of the new government's most concerned points. The solution may be to announce a deferral of payment or to re-borrow 160,000,000 US dollars. It is heard that President Cespedes has ordered the Minister of Finance to directly negotiate economic and financial issues related to the two countries with the United States. (Fifteenth day, Havas telegram)</p>
<h3>The Idea of Independence is Increasingly Firm</h3>
<p>The US-Cuba Treaty Needs to be Amended</p>
<p>Havana The overthrow of the Machado government may have a very large impact, that is, the cancellation of the Platt Amendment to the US-Cuba Treaty. The Platt Amendment obligates Cuba to allow the United States to intervene in Cuban affairs at any time. Cuba is very grateful for the United States' help in its independence, and is willing to cooperate sincerely and amicably with the United States, but Cubans believe that the obligations of the US-Cuba Treaty and the Platt Amendment restrict their independence and are becoming unbearable. Now, the resentment of the Cubans is even greater than before. Cubans regard the overthrow of the Machado government as a second liberation, and the idea of independence is increasingly firm. Knowledgeable people in the United States know the independent sentiments of the Cubans, so they think that President Roosevelt should not oppose in principle the amendment of the US-Cuba Treaty and the cancellation of the Platt Amendment.

Now he is penniless in Nassau and has telegraphed friends here to raise funds for his living expenses and to hire a lawyer to protect his huge property and prevent the government from confiscating it. However, although there is no confiscation movement here, the Havana court today received a civil lawsuit accusing Machado of embezzling public funds, requesting an investigation into the flow of public funds during Machado's tenure. It is said that the amount involved in the case is quite large. Machado was originally a Cuban tycoon and invested a lot in various industries. (Fifteenth day, National Telegram)</p>

At present, there is still a gap between the government and the Seiyukai. The government wants to agree with the Seiyukai on the principles of national policy, and first invites Suzuki to serve as a member of the National Policy Deliberation Council. The details will be discussed by this council. The Seiyukai wants to agree with the government on the details of the policy, so the opinions of both sides are still not close.

<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government plans to establish a National Policy Deliberation Council, and win over representatives from various factions as members to serve as a backing for the current government. If President Suzuki agrees, or the national policy agreement is successful, Saito will serve as the chairman, and Suzuki will be invited to serve as the vice chairman. It is heard that the Seiyukai will take this opportunity to abandon its anti-government policy because the national atmosphere is very unfavorable, so the future does not need to be pessimistic. (Sixteenth day, China United Press telegram) (Tokyo) After meeting with the Japanese Emperor in Hayama yesterday, Prime Minister Saito and Finance Minister Takahashi further discussed the issue of cooperation with the Seiyukai. Saito told Takahashi that Hatoyama's opinion had undergone three changes. The first was that the minister without portfolio and the agreement on policy could not be separated, and then he advocated separating the connection, and then changing the agreement on policy to the agreement on national policy. Saito and Takahashi both agreed in principle to the issue of agreeing on national policy, but only the method was undecided. The Seiyukai hopes to agree with the government alone in order to cancel the anti-government banner. The government seems to want to establish a National Policy Deliberation Council, net the forces of all parties, and invite Suzuki to serve as a member to determine the national policy in this organization. Saito returned to Beijing this morning after the Japanese Emperor arrived in Yokosuka. (Sixteenth day, China United Press telegram)</p>

<h3>League of Nations Opium Standing Committee</h3>
<p>Reviewing the Work Report of the Previous Session</p>
<p>Havas, 15th, Geneva The Permanent Central Opium Committee held a public meeting to review the report of the committee's secretariat on the work situation since the last meeting. The committee had previously ordered an investigation into the import of a substance extracted from Peruvian coca juice into Canada. The investigation report has now been reviewed by the committee, proving that this extraction was carried out before the coca was exported from Peru. All doubts have been dispelled. Peru was originally not included in the 1931 Geneva Convention restricting the manufacture and distribution of narcotics. Now that it has joined, it is hoped that the extraction of this Magan will not escape international supervision. Also, the increase in Uruguay's consumption of heroin in 1930 is quite worrying. It has gradually decreased in recent years, and the committee is very satisfied. The committee also plans to hold other public meetings during this session.</p>
<h3>Italy-Russia Treaty Negotiations</h3>

Well-informed sources in Paris all believe that the agreement being negotiated between Italy and Russia will include both non-aggression and neutrality, and will be different from the agreements recently signed by Soviet Russia with its neighbors, because it does not contain a precise definition of aggression. The French press said that after Italy signs this agreement, it will join hands with the Eastern European countries that have signed non-aggression agreements with Britain and Russia.</p>

<p>Deciding on Four Measures</p>
<p>Troops... Discretionary Reorganization</p>
<p>Generals... Separately Appoint to Various Duties</p>
<p>Political Affairs... Partial Reorganization of the Provincial Government</p>
<p>Party Affairs... Party Headquarters Moved Back for Consolidation</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Military Branch Council held a routine meeting this morning. He Yingqin, Jiang Bocheng, Qin Dechun, Men Zhizhong, Bao Wenwei, Rong Zhen, and others attended. Chairman He discussed the post-incident affairs in Chahar Province and decided on four measures: 1. Troops: After Feng went to Shandong, there were still more than 40,000 mixed troops in Chahar Province. Those who have been appointed and reorganized by the Military Branch Council include Zhang Renjie, Liu Zhendong, Tan Zixin, and Li Shouchong's troops. There are still more than 20,000 people left, who will be disciplined with firearms and reorganized at discretion. Of these more than 20,000 people, there is still a militia in the interior, which will still be returned to the people and handled locally. The bandit troops that have been incorporated will be eliminated. 2. Generals: The generals of the Chahar army have already been summoned to Beiping by He to serve as members of the Military Branch Council. It is heard that Fang sent a reply telegram to Beiping yesterday, saying that because the military affairs have not yet ended, he cannot leave the defense for the time being. This side will still urge Fang to come to Beiping in the future. As for Ji Hongchang, he will be given a title to make him leave the army. The rumors that the Chahar generals have new brewing issues, because Sun Liangcheng, Ruan Xuanwu, and others do not agree, it is no longer a problem. 3. Political Affairs: The provincial government will be reorganized. If the heads of the various departments of the original Chahar Provincial Government cannot return to their posts, Song will recommend other members to supplement them. After obtaining Song's consent, the Central Government will formally appoint them. 4. Party Affairs: Since Feng took over the Anti-Japanese Allied Army, the Provincial Party Headquarters moved to Beiping to work. Now that Feng has left Chahar, the Chahar Party Headquarters can move back and a thorough reorganization will be carried out. After the above measures were discussed and decided, they will be submitted to the Central Government for approval and implementation. The meeting was adjourned at noon. During the meeting, the issue of military expenditure in Chahar Province was also discussed. The clothing expenses paid by Song will be paid by the National Government. (Sixteenth day, telegram) (Beiping) Song Zheyuan believes that the authorities have drafted detailed measures for the Chahar affairs, and decided to return to Chahar immediately, and return to Beiping on the 17th. After a slight deployment, he will lead all his personnel to return to Chahar by special train on the 18th, and handle the situation in accordance with the established method. Within one month, he will restore the military and political affairs of Chahar Province to their old state. Zhao Pilian returned to Beijing today. (Sixteenth day, special telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Pang said that he would never enter Chahar, and the military headquarters would be set up in Xuanhua. Guan Linzheng and Wang Jingjiu's troops have taken over defense of Chicheng, Longguan and other places. (Sixteenth day, special telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Huang Fu will go to Beijing from Lushan, and after meeting with Song, he will return to the north. (Sixteenth day, special telegram)</p>
<p>Beiping-Hankou Railway</p>
<h3>Tentative Resumption of Traffic</h3>
<p>North-South Transportation Interrupted for Seven Days</p>
<p>Passengers Transfer to Barges for Crossing</p>
<p>(Hankou) It is reported that the Yellow River water has receded and the entire Pinghan Railway will tentatively resume traffic on the 16th. This north-south transportation interruption lasted for seven days, causing the Railway Bureau a loss of approximately 500,000 yuan. He Jingwu will return to the south bank immediately to consult with Wu Qihe, a technical expert from the Ministry of Railways, regarding repairs. (Special dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) An inspection reveals that seventy to eighty piers of the Pinghan Railway bridge have been blocked by mud or damaged by the water. While there is no major destruction, the bridge body is leaning eastward, making immediate repairs difficult. Currently, north-south passenger and freight trains are still running as usual, but traffic stops on both banks. Six barges are used for crossing the river. Armored trains are also stationed on both banks for protection. He Jingwu is stationed in Zhan Dian to oversee the repair of bridges and roads, initially focusing on protecting the foundations. Wang Jinzhi and Xiao Qizha are also assisting. (Special dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Pinghan Railway Bureau received a report stating that the Yellow River water level is gradually dropping. However, between the 59th and 90th piers of the railway bridge, the stone foundations under the piers have been completely eroded by the fierce current. The iron pillars have lost their support and are visibly shaking. The Railway Bureau is rushing to transport boulders to fill the gaps and reinforce the structure, requiring approximately 50,000 tons of material. Ordinary trains traveling on the line are still stopping on the north and south banks. Passengers must walk across the bridge before boarding the train to continue their journey. Special express trains will resume operation starting today. The procedure is as follows: when southbound trains arrive at the north bank, the locomotive will be detached, and passengers will transfer to covered wagons. The wagons will be pushed manually across the 59th to 90th piers of the railway bridge, then the south bank locomotive will be reattached to proceed northward. The same procedure will be followed when northbound trains arrive at the south bank. Due to the heavy luggage, this procedure is not suitable for ordinary trains. (Special dispatch on the 16th)</p>

<p>American Cotton and Wheat Loan</p>
<h3>Various Parties Request a Share</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The American cotton loan has not yet arrived in Shanghai, and the provinces that have requested a share have been reported previously. Recently, the Guidance of Huai River Committee has requested the allocation of a portion to complete the Huai River Guidance Project. The Hubei Provincial Party Headquarters has requested the allocation of the American cotton loan to dredge the Yangtze River, stating that it does not contradict the standard of use passed by the Legislative Yuan. (Special dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Tang Youren, a Japanese businessman, said that the claim that American cotton is being dumped is based on speculation. The reason for this speculation is that cotton merchants are in financial distress and unable to purchase, so some nervous people have spread this absurd rumor. However, government officials have not heard of such a thing. (Special dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<h3>Xinjiang's Provincial Division Issue</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the issue of dividing Xinjiang into provinces, the government's consideration concluded that the province currently has only over six million people. The area is vast and sparsely populated, and finances are already very difficult. If it is further divided, administrative expenses will inevitably increase the burden on the people. Because the southern part of the province is prosperous and the northern part is poor, it is practically difficult to do so. It is better to postpone the discussion for the time being and consider it again in the future. (Special dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>National Council</p>
<h3>Quota for Hui Members</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Mongolian Council has repeatedly received telegrams from Hui leaders in Xinjiang and Qinghai provinces requesting the determination of the number of Hui members in the National Council. After several discussions by the Council, it was decided that Hui Muslims are scattered throughout the country, and there is a possibility of participating and being elected in professional organizations in various provinces and cities. Therefore, there is no restriction on the number of members. However, the southern part of Xinjiang is entirely inhabited by Hui people, and its social organization has special circumstances. At this time of turmoil in Xinjiang, if the number of Hui members can be clearly stipulated in that region, it can also be used to reassure them. It is planned to collect opinions and submit them to the Executive Yuan for adoption. (Special dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>Ammonium Sulfate Plant</p>
<h3>Decision to be Operated by Chinese Merchants</h3>
<p>Measures for the Treatment of Commercial Shares</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The loan for the ammonium sulfate plant was once informally announced by the Ministry to be suspended due to the lack of sincerity of foreign merchants. It has been decided that Chinese merchants will operate the plant themselves. Recently, someone has been in contact to try out the operation. The capital amount is still set at 11 million yuan, with 5 million yuan from British and German companies and 6 million yuan from the Ministry of Industry. However, the Ministry of Industry will extract 3 million yuan from the 6 million yuan as commercial shares to attract commercial investment. Each share is 100 yuan, and the amount of purchase is at will, but at least one share is required as a unit. This stock offering procedure is currently underway in Shanghai. As for the measures for the treatment of commercial shares, the Ministry has also decided that: (1) Official shares and commercial shares enjoy equal rights under the law; (2) The number of directors elected by official and commercial parties is equal; (3) If the company encounters a major loss, the commercial shares will be responsible first. If it exceeds the amount of 3 million yuan of official shares, the commercial shares will replenish it. The Ministry of Industry is currently waiting for the stock funds to be fully raised, and then the commercial shareholders will elect three representatives to jointly establish a contract with the three representatives of the Ministry of Industry and the British and German representatives. The contract will be effective with the consent of all three parties. It is reported that Mr. Budela, the representative of the Brunner Mond Company of the British side, has asked the head office for instructions on the payment method, and the German representative has also telegraphed back to the country for instructions. As for the factory site issue, it will be resolved in conjunction with the steel plant site after the steel plant site is decided. (Special dispatch on the 16th)</p>

<p>German-Austrian Border</p>
<h3>Hitler</h3>
<p>Narrowly Escaped Disaster</p>
<p>Retinue Car Overturned</p>
<p>Adjutant's Arm Broken, Niece Injured</p>
<p>Reuters, Munich, 15th - Today, German Chancellor Hitler narrowly escaped disaster when his car passed through the border between Austria and Bavaria. The true facts have not yet been ascertained, but it is known that after Hitler's car passed, the car following it suddenly overturned. Hitler's adjutant, Bulukoler, was thrown from the car, resulting in a broken arm and serious internal injuries, which are feared to be difficult to recover from. Hitler's niece and his sister were also injured. It is learned that the route taken by Hitler was decided at the time of departure, so his political enemies could not have known his whereabouts in advance. His encounter with danger was accidental.</p>
<h3>Intense Political Strife in Southern Ireland</h3>
<p>Fanlerala Has Dictatorial Power</p>
<p>Severe Laws to Punish Political Criminals</p>
<p>Reuters, Dublin, 15th - The Irish Free State is now practically under martial law. Fanlerala has dictatorial power, and there is no doubt that he intends to use this power. The Blue Shirts and the Cosgrave Party are holding talks because of the possibility of holding a general election soon in order to stand on the same front. However, this negotiation has reached a stalemate. It is reported that several former cabinet members in the Blue Shirts demanded that General Wardufei be given the position of leader, which Cosgrave did not allow. Rumors are circulating that someone is urging Mr. Ke to resign. Fanlerala has decided to establish a military court to deal with political crimes. According to the Irish Daily News, the authorities will give the police the power to arrest those suspected of being members of illegal groups and can prohibit public meetings. The military court will have the power to deal with cases ranging from a fine of one shilling to the death penalty. It will probably be used to curb the National Guard. The Irish Free State began searching for weapons today. It is reported that a large number of weapons have recently been smuggled into Southern Ireland and are owned by tens of thousands of people, including members of the Blue Shirts and soldiers of the Irish Republican Army. It remains to be seen whether the search will also extend to the Irish Republican Army.</p>
<h3>Feng Yuxiang Leaves Chahar, Passes Through Beiping, and Heads South</h3>
<p>Jing</p>
<p>Public Memorial Service for Anti-Japanese Martyrs Before Leaving Zhangjiakou</p>
<p>Song Zheyuan and Others Only Separated at Fengtai</p>
<p>Song and Han Share Living Expenses After Arriving in Shandong</p>
<p>Beiping Special News - The reason why Feng Yuxiang left Zhangjiakou this time and made this decision was, of course, due to the difficult circumstances, but also because after consideration, if he remained in Zhangjiakou or north of Zhangjiakou, some unfortunate situation would inevitably occur. Song Zheyuan's mediation methods would also be exhausted at that time, and Feng himself believed that after this unfortunate situation occurred, it would be absolutely harmful to the country, friends, and himself in any respect. When Feng expressed his determination to go south, the radical elements of his subordinates cried bitterly and strongly urged him to stay, saying that Feng should not lightly abandon this basic revolutionary armed force. Seeing that Feng could not be persuaded, they stopped arguing. Currently, the troops originally under Feng's command have completely left Zhangjiakou. Their current locations are: (A) Fang Zhenwu stationed in Wanquan and Zhangbei; (B) Sun Liangcheng stationed in Shangdu; (C) Ji Hongchang stationed in Duolun and Guyuan; (D) Tan Zixin, Li Zhongyi, Zhang Lisheng, and Zhi Yinglin are all stationed in Zhangbei; (E) Liu Guitang stationed in Chicheng and Longguan. Among them, Zhang Renjie's troops of Fang Zhenwu's army have been reorganized by the Military Branch, totaling one division (three-regiment system), and there is no problem. Fang himself is currently residing in Wanquan. The Beiping military authorities specially sent representatives to Wanquan on the morning of the 14th to urge Fang to come to Beiping and serve as a member of the Military Branch. It is heard that Fang has a good private relationship with a certain authority on weekdays. Although he may not be able to respond to the call immediately, he may be able to submit to some extent. The remaining troops, such as Sun Liangcheng's, can also be easily negotiated. The most difficult ones are the troops of Ji Hongchang and others. Although the central government has now instructed Song Zheyuan to be responsible for handling them, there are many difficulties and it may not be easy to resolve them for a while. Therefore, although Feng's departure can bring the Chahar incident to an end, it cannot be immediately concluded that everything will be completely fine from now on. Feng's resolute departure to the south this time will completely eliminate the armed forces he has been operating in Zhangjiakou for a year, but it will naturally increase some goodwill on the part of the central government. Especially his not making things difficult for mediators such as Song Zheyuan and Han Fuju forces Song and Han to find ways to deal with Feng's whereabouts in the future. Therefore, after Feng arrives at Mount Tai, the central government will have a considerable title so that Feng will not be completely idle. As to whether Feng is willing to take office, that is another question. The following is a record of Feng's passage through Chahar.</p>
<h3>Passage Through Zhangjiakou</h3>
<p>After Feng issued the telegram, Shandong Chairman Han Fuju telegraphed Feng, welcoming him to reside in Mount Tai. Feng did not express anything for the time being because he was waiting to meet Song Zheyuan and personally planned to reside in Zhangbei temporarily, not wanting to leave Chahar. Later, because the central government and Beiping repeatedly telegraphed Feng, requesting him to leave Chahar immediately and head south so that Song Zheyuan could return to Chahar and freely handle the military and political affairs of Chahar Province, Song also feared that Feng's residence in Zhangbei would easily be used and exploited. Therefore, he arrived in Zhangjiakou on the 12th. Feng welcomed him at the train station in person. Upon meeting, old tears welled up in his eyes. Because there were many people present, Feng said to Song, "Please greet them." Then he returned to the New Village. Song rushed to the New Village, and Feng received him in the bedroom, reminiscing about the past and thinking about the future. They were mutually saddened for a long time. Feng's expression showed no nostalgia, but he had some consideration about his residence. On the 13th, Han Fuju sent a telegram remitting 25,000 yuan, and Feng's determination to go to Mount Tai was settled. The reason why Han sent a telegram of welcome was because certain celebrities in Beiping and Shanghai telegraphed Han, saying that Feng was still in Chahar, which was a difficult situation to resolve, intending to urge Han to resolve this matter thoroughly. Therefore, Han welcomed Feng to Shandong. Feng still planned to issue a declaration on the evening of the 13th. A certain gentleman said that what Mr. wanted to say had already been revealed in the world and telegrams without leaving anything unsaid, so there was no need to say more. Therefore, it was stopped. In fact, a certain gentleman considered Feng's You telegram issued on May 26 (to join the Allied Army) to be drafted by himself. Now that Feng intended to issue the last telegram, he could not bear to write it. On the 12th, Feng and Song and others held a public memorial service for the anti-Japanese martyrs at the Zhangjiakou Martyrs Memorial Tower. In Feng's speech, there were the words "Wash the rivers and mountains with hot blood, exchange the territory with heads, black water and white mountains, forever leave great achievements, heroic feelings and strange節, really sad". Under the words, he followed with weeping. Feng also pointed to the tilted part of the tip of the tower (the tip of the tower is tilted to the northeast) and sobbed to the crowd, "The Northeast has not been recovered, there is such a tower tip, please do not forget it." On the morning of the 13th, Feng summoned the staff of the headquarters to the Self-Reflection Hall in the New Village to give instructions and distributed dismissal fees. Qiu Shanning, the chief of staff, temporarily stayed in Zhangjiakou to handle</p>
<p>Aftermath. The rest of the staff left Zhangjiakou. On the same day, Feng telegraphed Han, notifying the departure date. Han replied that he would send an armored train north on the morning of the 14th to meet him at Fengtai. After receiving the telegram, Feng decided to depart on the morning of the 14th. The day before Feng's departure, Feng's generals Ji Hongchang, Sun Liangcheng, and others went to the New Village to bid farewell to Feng. From Feng's joining the anti-Japanese allied army on May 26 to August 14, it happened to be the number nine. This scene came to an end.</p>
<h3>Situation Passing Through Beiping</h3>
<p>On the 13th, two special trains were prepared at Zhangjiakou Railway Station. The first train had a total of 14 carriages for Feng Song and his entourage. The second train carried Feng Song's pistol team and guards, occupying 23 carriages. It departed first at 2:00 a.m. on the 14th. Feng also boarded the train at 2:00 a.m., only leading a dozen guards. Zhang Jiyong, Guo Zhihan, Liu Zhizhou, Deng Zhexi, and Li Xin and others followed. At 3:00 a.m., Song Zheyuan and Tai Decun boarded the train, and the special train departed at 4:00 a.m. Because it was late at night, there were very few people seeing them off. At dawn, the train passed through Xuanhua, stopped briefly, and continued forward. At 8:00 a.m., it arrived at Qinglongqiao. Because it was necessary to change vehicles, it stopped for a long time. At 9:00 a.m., the special train arrived at Nankou. After Feng Song had breakfast, they went to visit the Memorial Tower of the Martyrs of the National Army in Nankou. Feng smiled at this time, and there must have been infinite emotions in his heart. The special train arrived at the Xizhimen Railway Station in Beiping at 12:45 p.m. on the 14th. Those who came to welcome him included He Yingqin's representative Liu Jianqun, Huang Fu's representative He Qigong, Military Branch Chief of Staff Xiong Bin, Central Committee Member Fu Rulin, Han Fuju's representative Cheng Xixian, 29th Army Division Commander Feng Zhian, Zhang Zizhong, and Feng's former subordinates Men Zhizhong, Shen Ke, and others. Feng's special train stayed for about five minutes. The welcoming staff successively boarded the train, shook hands with Feng, and paid their respects. Feng was very healthy in spirit, wearing blue cloth clothes and pants, blue cloth shoes, his face was old, his beard had been shaved, and he was as tall as before. However, he wore a large maroon Parker fountain pen on his chest, which adorned his cloth clothes and had a unique style. Feng exchanged pleasantries and thanked the welcomers one by one. After a while, the car started again. He Qigong, Fu Rulin, Liu Jianqun, Cheng Xixian, Feng Zhian, Zhang Zizhong, Shen Ke, and others also boarded the car and followed along. At 1:45 p.m., it arrived at Fengtai. Han Fuju sent the second battalion commander of the artillery, Liu Chunen, and Deputy Adjutant Meng, to wait at the station with the Taishan armored train. Feng ordered the armored train to start first. Then, he shook hands with the welcomers one by one to say goodbye. At 2:30 p.m., he still took the original car east. When he arrived at Huangcun, Feng and his entourage changed to the armored train. Song Zheyuan and Division Commanders Feng Zhian and Zhang Zizhong said goodbye to Feng and took the accompanying special train back to Beiping.</p>
<h3>Feng Yuxiang Talks</h3>
<p>When Feng Song arrived at Xizhimen, the reporter boarded the car and followed him to Fengtai. When he arrived at 1:40 p.m., he immediately submitted his name card to request an audience. At that time, Feng was meeting with Fu Rulin, He Qigong, Liu Jianqun, and others. After a short stay, Feng invited the reporter to the third-class passenger car to meet. After Feng shook hands with the reporter, they sat down one after another. Feng first said, "I passed through Beiping and went north on October 10 last year. Today is August 14, and ten months have passed. I am coming south again." After Feng finished speaking, he had the following conversation with the reporter: Reporter (Q): Mr. Feng, how is the situation of handing over the military and political affairs of Chahar Province? Feng (A): I have always advocated that the guns should be pointed outwards and not inwards. The reason for handing over this time is to implement the original intention. My original intention was to recover the lost land first and preserve Chahar Province. After the lost land is recovered, it will be handed over to the government and the people. How I said it in the beginning, that's how I will do it. (Q): Mr. Feng, how about the recovery of the lost land? (A): People in the money class generally said that Duolun did not fight. In fact, when we recovered Duolun, more than 1,600 officers and soldiers were killed or wounded. When I left Zhangjiakou, I specially built a memorial tower for them. At the same time, I built a martyrs' shrine in Mr. Zhang Zhijiang's old house in Zhangjiakou, and all the names of the fallen martyrs were engraved on a very tall monument. Before I left Zhangjiakou, I held a memorial service, and in addition to personally offering sacrifices, I received many plaques from local gentry and businessmen. (Q): What is the situation in Duolun now? (A): Duolun is still in our hands now. Someone outside said very early that it has been lost. In fact, we have waited until now and have not lost it. We have only seen Japanese planes arrive, but we have not seen Japanese troops. Li Shouxin, the puppet army stationed near Duolun, sent a representative to find me, Feng Yuxiang, to ask if we were attacking Rehe. If we attack, he wants to fight on the front line and directly attack Chengde. Otherwise, he will immediately leave the Duolun line and will never help the Japanese to fight himself. The Japanese side has been pressuring Li's troops to capture Duolun. Li's troops have not yet taken action. (According to official news, the puppet army captured Duolun on the 13th.) (Q): Mr. Feng, what are your thoughts on the future of the country? (A): I am also not convenient to say this question. Let's be more forgiving to each other. (Q): Did Sun Liangcheng come with Mr. Feng? (A): I am a ten-mu field, a single sorghum seedling. (Q): Where is Fang Zhenwu now? Can he come to Beiping immediately? (A): Fang is still in the Zhangbei Wanquan area. I dare not say whether he can come to Beiping. At this point, Feng stood up, smiled, and said, "I am not convenient to say any more. The Shaguo I brought from Nankou is very good. Please eat a few to enjoy your appetite." After saying this, he ordered his adjutant to give the reporter five Shaguo, and then he smiled and left.</p>

<h3>Situation Passing Through Tianjin</h3>
<p>Feng’s special train arrived at Huangcun at 3 PM on the 14th. After Feng changed trains, it departed at 3:30 PM and arrived at Langfang at approximately 4 PM. Because it awaited the arrival of the accompanying guard’s special train at Wanzhuang, it stopped in Langfang for about three hours. This area was Feng’s defense zone when he served as the commander of the 16th Brigade in the early Republic of China era, so Feng disembarked to look around and recall old memories. After dinner, it was already 7 PM. The special train continued forward, passing Yangcun and Beicang; the sky had already darkened. By the time it arrived at Tianjin Central Station, thousands of homes were already lit. Those waiting at the station included Wei Jian, the Director of Civil Affairs of Hebei Province; Chen Baoquan, the Director of Education; Ning Xiangnan, the Director of Public Security; and Feng’s subordinates Li Wuzhong, Liu Yufen, and Lin Shuyan, among others. There was also a band at the station playing to welcome him. Security was tight inside and outside the station. The armored train sent by Han Fuju arrived at the station half an hour earlier. Feng’s special train arrived subsequently, carrying five or six third-class and boxcars and one second-class car. Feng stayed in the second-class car, using candles instead of electric lights. Feng did not disembark to meet the welcoming personnel but specially sent Deng Zhexi to disembark, briefly saying that Feng was slightly unwell due to fatigue and eating cold melon along the way and expressed thanks on Feng’s behalf. He then boarded the train. The special train stayed at Tianjin Station for twenty minutes, with only Li Wuzhong, Liu Yufen, and Feng’s brother Daoji boarding the train for a brief conversation. The special train then switched to the Jinpu Railway southward at 9:05 PM.</p>
<h3>Handling Affairs After Leaving Chahar Province</h3>
<p>After Feng Yuxiang went south, the Chahar affair came to an end. What urgently needs to be done next is the issue of handling affairs after leaving Chahar Province. Since Feng’s departure, there are still forty to fifty thousand troops of the old garrison in Chahar Province, all stationed in the northeastern part of Chahar. When Chairman Song Zheyuan accompanied Feng out of Chahar, he had already instructed the various armies to remain in their respective locations and await orders. Qin Dechun, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the 29th Army, followed Feng’s special train southward on the 14th. After getting off the train at Xizhimen, he immediately invited Xiong Bin for a meeting and asked Mr. Xiong to convey the current situation of Chahar Province to Minister He. At the time, He could not meet with Qin due to a toothache and instructed Xiong and Qin to draft a plan with Chairman Song regarding the policies for handling affairs after leaving Chahar Province, so that it could be adopted and implemented. After seeing Feng off to Huangcun, Song Zheyuan returned to Ping on the evening of the 14th. Because it was already dusk, he rested immediately. At approximately 10 AM on the morning of the 15th, Song went to Jurentang to meet He, reporting in great detail on his trip to Chahar and the current situation of Chahar Province, and hoping that the authorities would gather opinions from various parties to handle the aftermath. As for the debts owed by Feng when he left Chahar, such as the uniform expenses of the Allied Army, totaling nearly 100,000 yuan, Song has already agreed to pay them off on his behalf. Han Fuju and Song Zheyuan, among others, are willing to share the daily living expenses after Feng goes to Shandong. Mr. Song will stay in Ping for three or four days to discuss a definite solution for handling affairs after leaving Chahar Province before returning to Chahar immediately. The reporter went to Mr. Song’s private residence today (the 15th) to request an audience and was granted a meeting. What follows is a record of his conversation: "The Chahar incident was brought to a satisfactory conclusion because Mr. Feng’s guns were not pointed inward and the authorities repeatedly advocated for peace. The Central Government’s understanding of Chahar is difficult because it is located in a remote area and the truth is hard to discern, but Minister He (Yingqin) has always advocated for seeking solutions through peaceful means. This spirit of hard work and dedication is truly admirable. When I (Song refers to himself) went to Chahar, I had no definite plan, but I only hoped for two things: (1) to seek a peaceful resolution to the Chahar affair, and (2) to ask Mr. Feng to leave Chahar Province. Now that Mr. Feng has passed Ping and gone south, and the Chahar affair is headed toward a peaceful resolution, the objectives have all been achieved. Beyond this, there is the issue of the aftermath. I met with Minister He this morning. Because the issue of handling affairs after leaving Chahar Province is quite complex, it is necessary to gather opinions from various parties and jointly discuss a suitable solution to hand over to me for handling, which may yield good results. Minister He also quite agrees with this. I will stay in Ping for three or four days. After a decision is made, I will return to Chahar immediately. As for the garrison in Chahar Province, there are still forty to fifty thousand troops. I have ordered them to temporarily stay in their original defenses and await orders. Zhang Renjie is currently in Wanquan, and the old subordinates of Li Shouzhong and Deng Wen, Tan Zixin, etc., are in the Zhangbei Shangdu area. Liu Guitang is in Chicheng. Everyone takes the national interest as the premise. If they can be frank and meet each other sincerely, there is nothing that cannot be resolved. The majority of the Volunteer Army is quite admirable, so they should also be properly handled and cannot be equated with bandits who are incorporated into the army. For example, there is someone in the Volunteer Army who is nearly eighty years old. I have forgotten his name. This person was originally a wealthy household in Beizhen County, Liaoning, with over four hundred guards. After the September 18th Incident, the Japanese army arrived in Beizhen and wanted to occupy his house. This person was so indignant that he eliminated an entire row of Japanese soldiers. This person could not stay in his hometown because of this, so he led his guards to join the Volunteer Army. In situations like this, a way must be found to properly care for them in their later years. The issue of reorganizing the Chahar Provincial Government is that all the current directors are only temporarily maintaining the transition. In the future, they will still have to follow the clear orders of the Central Government. The various military commanders in Chahar Province may all retain their original positions. After Mr. Feng goes south, Li Xiehe (Lie Jun) will go to Shandong to meet Feng. The telegrams from Dolon have recently been cut off. It is said that the Japanese army pressured the puppet army of Li Shouxin, who has already captured Dolon. The details are still unknown."</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Zhangjiakou</h3>
<p>According to someone who returned to Ping on Feng’s special train, the streets of Zhangjiakou are filled with soldiers moving back and forth like weaving shuttles. Red and green slogans are densely plastered on the walls, such as “Welcome Chairman Song,” “Eliminate the Communist Bandits,” and “Strictly Arrest the Roaming Soldiers,” all of which are brand new and were likely posted recently. All the shops are operating as usual, calm as ever, as if they have not experienced any changes. In addition to the original taxes, no additional taxes have been levied. However, during the time of transportation isolation, there was a shortage of various goods, and the market was sluggish, which was a deep concern for merchants. Now that the train has been restored, it will not be affected in any way. According to locals, the population of Zhangjiakou has invisibly increased a lot due to the previous political changes. Those seeking opportunities have flocked to the area, and the new and old agency personnel are gathered and have not yet dispersed. In addition, with the train newly restored, tourists are gathering, so there are more people than before. The hotels are all overcrowded, and the prosperity of business can be seen in general. Although the streets of Zhangjiakou are wide, they are particularly muddy when it rains, and water collects like ditches, making it difficult to move an inch. Large shops are like ordinary foreign goods stores in Beiping, but prices are not more expensive than in Beiping. The level of culture is very low. The schools include the Provincial Normal School, the First Vocational School, and the Agricultural School. The Provincial Government is located in Shangbao, and the various departments are not in the same location. The guards in front of the doors are strict, and the atmosphere of a state of emergency is fully revealed. Because the various department heads have not been fully announced, the state of neglect is immediately visible. Feng’s residence in the New Village is the site of the rural school, with elegant scenery and is one of the few beautiful places in the area. Feng built a monument and memorial hall for the fallen soldiers of the Battle of Dolon to the west of the New Village. The monument has been completed, but the memorial hall has not yet been completed. The completion date will have to wait. (15th)</p>
<h3>Feng Yuxiang Arrives in Jinan</h3>
<p>Many Regretful Remarks En Route</p>
<p>A Short Stay in Jinan Before Going to Mount Tai</p>
<p>Jinan Communication, Feng Yuxiang having left Zhangnan on the evening of the 13th, Chairman Han Fuju of Shandong specially dispatched a special train and an armored train to the north to welcome him. At 9:40 AM this morning (the 15th), Feng’s special train arrived at Sangyuan, having already entered Shandong. The special train</p>
<h3>Feng Yuxiang Upon Arrival in Jinan</h3>
<p>Traveled, with the armored car in front. Li Hanzhang, the commander of the 74th Division stationed in Dezhou and also a former subordinate of Feng, led all officers above the rank of major to wait at the station, and dispatched two battalions of soldiers to be stationed at both ends of the platform for guard duty. There was also a military band and a platoon of pistol team members lined up on the platform to welcome him. At 10:20 AM, the special train entered the station amidst military music. The train stopped, and Feng immediately got off the train, shook hands with the welcoming personnel, and paid attention to the spirit and physique of each person, as they were mostly his former subordinates. He also inspected along the car in front of the pistol team, paying attention to the physique, clothing, firearms, and spirit of the soldiers. Because the military police stationed at the station were wearing yellow military uniforms, Feng also inspected their symbols. When he walked to the front of the broadsword team, he took a broadsword from a soldier’s hand, looked at it for a long time, and said, “It’s a bit too thin.” After the inspection, he said to Li Hanzhang, “Very good, very good. Your spirit is also very good. It’s all based on a good foundation from back then. It’s not something that can be done in a day.” An Shude, the former garrison commander of Pingliang Town, now residing in Dezhou, also arrived at the station to welcome him and met with Feng. Feng asked who he lived with there, and An replied that his parents were there, etc. Feng immediately asked him to send his regards to his parents on his behalf. He then boarded the train with Li Hanzhang and others for a conversation and ordered to buy many watermelons to reward his subordinates. At this time, the special train departed from Dezhou to the south. The reporter, having arrived in Dezhou from Jinan to welcome him yesterday, also boarded the train to return to Jinan. After the train started, the reporter immediately asked Deng Zhexi to request an audience with Mr. Feng, which was granted. The reporter then entered Feng’s room. Feng was staying in a third-class car compartment. On the table were several business cards, a pair of glasses, a copy of “Romance of the Eastern Zhou Dynasties,” a teapot, and a large coarse pottery bowl. Feng sat upright with his eyes closed, resting. When the reporter entered, Feng stood up to greet him and offered him a seat. After exchanging pleasantries, the reporter first asked Mr. Feng how his health was recently. Feng replied, “Good, good.” (Asked) “Now that the Chahar affair has come to an end, what are Mr. Feng’s thoughts on this?” (Answered) “The military and political affairs of Chahar Province have now been completely handed over to Chairman Song. When I telegraphed that I would become the commander-in-chief of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army, I set two conditions for myself: one, never point the guns inward; and two, use armed force to protect Chahar Province. Now, Chahar Province is intact, and the lost territory of the four eastern counties of Chahar has been recovered. The military and political power has been handed over to the Central Government, and not a single shot has been fired inward. The troops who followed me to resist Japan in Chahar Province now number at least 110,000. They are all Volunteer Army soldiers who retreated from Jilin, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, and Rehe. They are all very good anti-Japanese soldiers. Some of them have only a few thousand left out of seventy or eighty thousand. So they are all elite troops. They fought against the Japanese army and died or were wounded, but no one cared about them. Some wounded soldiers were carried to Zhangjiakou, and their wounds were festering because there was no medicine to treat them. Now, in the summer, the anti-Japanese soldiers are still wearing leather hats and coats. When I arrived in Zhangjiakou, I gave everyone a change of clothes, two meals of meat, a bath, and a talk. During the talks, everyone cried loudly because their ancestral graves and families had all been lost. So when they mentioned the three northeastern provinces and Rehe, they cried loudly. With a little encouragement, they were all filled with indignation and were willing to risk their lives to kill the enemy. Everyone was loyal, brave, and unyielding. Even the troops led by Ji Hongchang went to recover the lost territory of the four eastern counties of Chahar. They were conquered without a fight. The Battle of Dolon was extremely fierce. It happened to coincide with heavy rain for seven or eight consecutive days. The army ran out of food, and our army suffered greatly, fighting while enduring hunger. As a result, more than 1,500 people were killed in action, and Dolon was finally recovered. But the domestic propaganda said that Dolon had not been recovered, or that it had been recovered without a fight, or that it had only had a small conflict with the puppet army and then been recovered. I really don’t know what their opinions are. Now I have done two things: one, not point the guns inward; and two, use armed force to protect Chahar Province. I have handed over the military and political power to the Central Government and returned it to the people of the country. I have also built a memorial monument in Chahar for the fallen soldiers of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army who recovered the lost territory in eastern Chahar, and I have transformed Mr. Zhang Zhijiang’s villa in Zhangjiakou into a shrine for the martyrs who fought for resistance against Japan, and I have built a cemetery for the anti-Japanese martyrs. At 2 PM on the afternoon of the 13th, I led all the military officers and Chairman Song, etc., to go to worship. Early on the morning of the 14th, I boarded the train and left Chahar. A public case has come to a hasty end. Looking back over the years, we have lost the three northeastern provinces because we did not resist Japan, and we have lost Rehe because we pretended to resist. Although news of battles has been frequent, only Song Zheyuan and Sun Dianying’s troops really fought a few battles. For example, we raise a dog that can guard the house, a cat that can catch mice, an ox that can plow the field, and a chicken that can lay eggs. What is the use of the country spending so much money to train soldiers? When the enemy comes, not only can they not protect the country, but these kinds of soldiers neither guard the house nor lay eggs. What are they for? Or they use the excuse that their military strength is not as strong or their equipment is not as precise. If their strength is not enough, then they should not lead troops or be military officers. If this continues, the Yellow River and the Yangtze River north of the river will be in danger. As the saying goes, ‘The best dishes are not touched with chopsticks.’ Where in the world is there a country as easy to bully as ours? Who still treats the Chinese as human beings? Who among the Chinese people still treats soldiers as human beings?” (Asked) “How will Mr. Feng’s future residence be resolved?” (Answered) “Not sure. Maybe I’ll go to Tai’an for a short rest.” (Asked) “Do you plan to get off the train when you return to Jinan?” (Answered) “Not sure. In the second year of Xuantong, I came to Jinan to review the troops, and I visited Daming Lake and Baotu Spring. I haven’t had the chance to see them again since then. Maybe I’ll take the opportunity to get off the train in Jinan to see the recent developments.” (Asked) “Does Mr. Feng plan to go to Nanjing?” (Answered) “Because Chiang and Wang sent telegrams to invite me, I plan to go, but the timing is uncertain.” (Asked) “Does Mr. Feng have any plans for future anti-Japanese work?” (Answered) “Yes, I’ll talk about it when the time comes.”</p>
<p>As the special train gradually approached Jinan, passing the Luokou Bridge, Feng looked down at the Yellow River from the window, and many feelings arose in his heart. He sighed with emotion, “If we don’t resist the enemy’s aggression, it will be over. Today I cross the Yellow River, and I look at the Yellow River, but I don’t know if this will still be within our country’s borders this time next year. From the Yellow River, I thought of Mount Tai. I don’t know if this will still be able to provide for our people’s livelihood this time next year.” As he spoke, he shook his head frequently, looking extremely pessimistic. The special train moved slowly forward, passing the Lufeng Yarn Factory, and then forward, passing the Jinan Coal Plant of the Zhongxing Coal Mining Company. Feng heard that the Lufeng Yarn Factory was jointly run by the former Prime Minister Pan Fu and the former Yangtze River Inspector Wang Zhanyuan, and that the Zhongxing Company was capitalized by the former President Li Yuanhong. He again sighed with emotion, “Official merchants, official merchants, only they can do big business, only they can make money, and ordinary people can only sell fried dough sticks.” The reporter then asked Feng how he would criticize Chairman Han’s three years in Shandong. Feng replied, “I have never interfered or inquired, and I have never come to see him, but according to what I have heard, everyone says that he is very good. The last time I lived in Mount Tai, an old friend told me that Han is doing very well in Shandong. The good thing is that the previous government asked for more money, but he (referring to Han) asks for less money. That’s probably true. According to what I have seen since coming to Shandong today, it’s generally very good,” etc. The provincial and municipal authorities, because Feng arrived in Jinan today, specially ordered the entire city to hang flags to welcome him. From the Provincial Government to Jinpu Station, the security team was doubled, with one or two people at each intersection facing inward for guard duty, armed with guns and live ammunition, which was extremely strict. The area near the station was closed to traffic. There were two companies of military bands and pistol brigade broadsword teams at the station to maintain order. No unauthorized people without symbols were allowed to the platform. At 2:30 PM, the important military and political personnel all arrived at the station to welcome him. Han Fuju, the Chairman of the Provincial Government, also arrived at the station in full military uniform to wait. At 2:15 PM in the afternoon, Feng’s special train arrived in Jinan. The welcomers all stood in front of the station, and the military music played loudly. The troops at the station raised their guns in salute. After the train stopped, Han first boarded the train to meet Feng and invited him to get off the train together. Feng then led Deng Zhexi, Li Qi, and others to get off the train and shook hands with the welcomers one by one, saying, “It’s so hot, you’ve all worked hard.” When he shook hands with Zheng Jicheng, Feng smiled and said, “You’ve gotten so fat,” and patted Zheng’s back with his hand, raised his thumb, and praised, “Good job.” When he shook hands with Sun Tonggang, he was overjoyed and repeatedly said, “You’ve grown so tall,” looking extremely affectionate. Han, standing aside, said, “It’s too hot, please come into the city to rest and have something to eat.” Feng hesitated slightly and replied, “Okay, okay.” Then he and the crowd were crowded out of the station. Feng and Han rode in the lead in a military vehicle, and the others followed in vehicles into the city. They arrived at the Provincial Government at 3:30 PM. Feng and Han talked in the chairman’s office, had a meal, and then rested. It is heard that Feng will stay in Jinan for two or three days, and Deng Zhexi, Li Qi, Zhang Jiyong, and others took a car from Jinan to Tai’an at 5:15 PM to prepare a residence for Feng. It is heard that it has been decided to stay at Puzhao Temple. (15th)</p>
<h3>Nanhui</h3>
<p>Tax Police Clash with Salt Smugglers</p>
<p>Yesterday, a villager named Ni, carrying five or six catties of salt, passed through the north end of Liuzhao Bay Town. He was spotted by several salt police, who immediately arrested him and took him to the Adusheng teahouse in the town, where they insulted Mr. Ni in every possible way, causing outrage among the bystanders, resulting in a clash. Mr. Ni took the opportunity to escape. The police then requested the Fourth District Office to arrest Mr. Ni on their behalf and sent someone to report to the Datuan Tax Police Team. The team dispatched more than 20 police officers to the town, armed with guns and live ammunition, setting up sentries and surrounding the district office. At that time, Liu Sifu and Gu Yonggen, the security guards of the district, were leaving the district office to deliver official documents when they were stopped and beaten severely by the police. Liu's head was broken, and Gu's leg was injured. The merchants and residents of the town, angered by the tax police's barbarity, went on strike. Gu Chuanyi, the District Chief, reported the serious situation to the county government by telegram. The county government immediately sent county public security patrol officer Jiao Buying to mediate, but the tax police were unreasonable and forced the female patrol officer Gu, the district chief's daughter, to issue a guarantee before temporarily calming down. Before leaving, they also smashed several shop doors and windows along the street to vent their anger.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>A Lawsuit Regarding a Burned Infant in the Church</p>
<p>A woman named Jiang Wang, the concubine of the deceased Jiang Naibo, once adopted a church infant, a female named Xiguan, from the nursery. She was treated as an adopted daughter, but was actually worse than a slave. She was whipped at the slightest dissatisfaction. Xiguan is only twelve years old, how could she endure such abuse? Last month, for some unknown reason, Xiguan's chest and back were burned, leaving scars like bananas. She was sent to a nunnery for care. Recently, the board of directors of the nursery heard about this and believed that Jiang Wang was so inhuman, so they specially entrusted lawyer Lu Longxiang as their representative to file a complaint with the prosecutor's office. During the interrogation this morning (the 16th), the general public could not bear to look at her. Jiang Wang, the perpetrator, was ordered to be taken into custody.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Rickshaw Pullers Strike Again</p>
<p>The rickshaw pullers in the entire county had previously gone on a general strike for two days, the 6th and 7th of this month, to protest against the rickshaw company's increase of 3.7 cents in rickshaw rental fees. After mediation by various party and government officials, a fair resolution was reached, and all of them resumed work uniformly on the 8th. County Magistrate Yan then summoned representatives from various agencies, groups, labor and management to discuss and decide on the rickshaw rental standards. The highest rental fee should not exceed 1,000 yuan, and the lowest should not be lower than 850 yuan. The county government issued a notice to implement this starting on the 16th. The day before yesterday (the 15th), County Magistrate Yan received a telegram from the Rickshaw Industry Association stating that in the streets and roads, a small number of unscrupulous rickshaw pullers were harboring ulterior motives, inciting good rickshaw pullers and using the excuse that the rental fees were too high and they could not make a living to attempt to instigate a second strike. They requested that the police be dispatched to prevent this from happening. After receiving the report, County Magistrate Yan immediately ordered Wang Wei, the captain of the police brigade, and Wu Dexin, the director of the public security bureau, to order each branch bureau to take strict precautions. At the same time, a notice was issued to the public to pay attention and not be incited. They should know that the decision on rickshaw rental fees was made after careful discussion and comprehensive consideration by various agencies and groups, and they should abide by it and carry on with their lives. If anyone who does not understand the benefits dares to disregard the law and create trouble, they will be arrested and punished severely, and no leniency will be shown. The technical director, Zhang Fulin, also went to meet Shen Zaichuan and Yi Jingting, the representatives of the Yancheng Hometown Association, to inquire about the current situation of the rickshaw pullers. According to them, the rickshaw pullers are divided into two types: short-shift and long-shift. The long-shift pullers have no prejudices, while the short-shift pullers have some unfounded actions. The two of them will be responsible for advising them to quell the source of the trouble. At 7 PM that evening, the police officers of the Second Branch Bureau of Public Security, while patrolling the area outside Guangfu Gate, captured a suspected rickshaw puller named Tang Zizi and transferred him to the General Bureau for questioning. They also discovered reactionary leaflets on the walls of the old site of the Yaoming Electric Light Factory, inciting rickshaw pullers to continue the strike. Yesterday (the 16th) morning, a portion of the rickshaw pullers actually went on strike, but the order was very good. Within a few hours, they resumed work.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Police and Bandits Exchange Fire at Da'an Port</p>
<p>Hupu Town in the 15th district of this county is located by the river and is a place where guest people live in hiding. The day before yesterday, Li Zhanhan, the leader of the 16th public security team stationed in Hupu, received a confidential report from Taicang stating that a group of bandits was scheduled to negotiate ransom payments at Hupu on the 15th. After receiving the report, Li personally led several patrol boats to patrol the river. When they sailed to the vicinity of Da'an Port, they saw three Sanhaizhou boats sailing on the river, with white cloth strips hanging on the masts as a sign. The police team knew that these were bandit ships and fired warning shots first. Unexpectedly, the bandit ships also opened fire in retaliation. The two sides clashed, lasting for more than an hour. The bandits finally gave way, and two ships escaped, leaving only one boat. The police surrounded it. There were no traces of bandits on the boat, only one man and two women bound in the cabin. When questioned, they claimed to be hostages kidnapped from Fuqiao, Taicang, and had been held for many months. They did not know why they were taken to the sea today, but they guessed that it was to negotiate ransom payments. Shi took the hostages to the team headquarters, transferred them to the district headquarters, and notified their families to come and claim them.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>The Perpetrators of the Qiantan Massacre Were Escorted to Suzhou</p>
<p>The Liu family in Qiantan Ten General Stores in Nantong suffered a massacre. The perpetrators, Qiu Kousheng, Liu Gushi, Qiu Er, and Dai Qun, were all sentenced to death by the court. The four perpetrators refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the High Court. They were all escorted to Suzhou on the 15th. Liu Gushi is pregnant and is due to give birth soon.</p>
<p>Bandits Run Rampant; Temporary Curfew</p>
<p>Recently, bandits have been rampant in various parts of Nantong City and the surrounding areas. The coastal areas along the river have also been disturbed by mutinous maritime patrols. On the 15th, Commissioner Ye specially convened representatives from the military, police, and groups to discuss defense and arrest measures. A temporary curfew is in effect every night after 12:00 AM.</p>

<h3>The Daily Newspaper Association Hosted a Banquet Last Night</h3>
<p>For the American Journalism University Travel Group</p>
<p>Mr. Yi Expressed That All Disputes Arise from Misunderstandings; Only Investigating the Truth Can Thoroughly Resolve Them</p>
<p>Professor Yixiu De of the Missouri School of Journalism in the United States led a group of 20 students to form a travel group that arrived in Shanghai some days ago to conduct an investigation, as previously reported. The group visited the Shen Bao and Xin Shen Pao newspaper offices yesterday morning and inspected the Zhabei Wusong war zone in the afternoon. In the evening at 8 PM, the Shanghai Daily Newspaper Association hosted a banquet at Xinghua Lou, attended by Shi Liangcai, Ma Yinliang, and Qian Bohan from the Shen Bao; Wang Boqi, Wang Zhongwei, and Wang Weizhen from the Xin Wen Pao; Huang Bohui and Zeng Manjun from the Shi Bao; Zhang Zhuping, Pan Gongbi, and Xiong Shaohao from the Shishi Xinbao; Pan Gongzhan and He Xiya from the Chen Bao; Guan Ji'an and Qian Cangshuo from the Min Bao; as well as Ying Xianguang, Xie Fusheng, Zhang Yixu, and reporters from various Western newspapers as guests. The toast and cheers continued until 11 PM late into the night before dispersing. The chairman's welcome speech and Mr. Yi's reply are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Address</h3>
<p>Chairman Wang Boqi delivered a welcome address, stating: "Today, the Newspaper Association welcomes Professor Illid and all the distinguished guests. Chairman Shi Liangcai is unable to attend due to other commitments and has asked me to represent him. On behalf of the Newspaper Association, I extend a warm welcome to all of you. Your visit to various countries from afar to directly observe the conditions in each nation is admirable. This spirit and undertaking is of particular importance to the news media, because when places are far apart, the effects of news differ, and the truth is often submerged by propaganda. Only through personal investigation can one understand the reality. A clear example of this is how the country invading China vigorously promotes propaganda in Europe and America, claiming that its actions are unavoidable. I believe that after your visit to the war zones of Zhabei and Wusong, you will deeply understand the falsity of their propaganda. The ruined walls and broken houses that remain in Zhabei and Wusong are all cultural institutions and civilian residences, places that were not defended by arms and yet were destroyed in this manner. I think that once you see this, you will understand the truth. You are the future talents of American public opinion. Sino-American relations have always been friendly, and our country's press has a particularly favorable impression of America, because the obstacles to the development of the news industry are mainly undeveloped education and inconvenient transportation. American industrial investment in China and the return of the Boxer Indemnity are indirectly related to the development of the news industry. I believe that after your on-site investigation in China, you will certainly be able to further promote the friendly relations between the two countries and the close ties between the two great nations. I sincerely hope that you will be able to advocate for people in your country to expand their research into the truth about China, so that they can better understand the situation in China. This is not only important for enhancing friendship, but also for the future of the world. The Far East issue is now the focus of the world, involving many complex events. It can be said that there are many places that will affect the future peace of the world. To maintain world peace, the joint efforts of the two great nations on the east and west sides of the Pacific Ocean are necessary. To awaken the attention of the people of the two countries, maintain the dignity of the covenants, and prevent world peace from being shaken, this responsibility lies with journalists. I only offer this suggestion and deeply believe that journalists from both countries can work together to maintain peace, and the results will certainly be impressive. I wish you all good health."</p>
<h3>Mr. Illid's Reply</h3>
<p>After the Chairman's address, Mr. Illid delivered a reply, saying: "Chairman and distinguished guests, we are deeply honored to participate in the grand banquet of the Shanghai Newspaper Association tonight. However, due to the hasty nature of this trip, we regret that we cannot have a thorough discussion with you. If there is an opportunity in the future, I hope to study your country's language so that I can broaden my knowledge. This trip to the Far East has given me one feeling: that all disputes and conflicts arise from misunderstandings. Misunderstandings lead to a lack of understanding, and nationalists and narrow-minded patriots in various countries develop xenophobic ideas, engage in destruction, and ultimately lead to endless disputes. As for resolving these disputes through world peace conferences and economic conferences, I fear that such conferences, even if held dozens or hundreds of times, will be useless. I deeply believe that to resolve all disputes, a thorough understanding is necessary. And a thorough understanding requires broadening one's perspective and conducting on-site investigations to examine the truth, so that all misunderstandings can be eliminated, and disputes will naturally cease. We are traveling to the Far East for this purpose, to investigate the real situation in various places in order to promote world peace. The results obtained in China are very good. We have already compiled a report and plan to conduct further research after returning to our country. On behalf of my school and classmates, I would like to express my deep gratitude to the Shanghai Newspaper Association and all of you for the grand banquet."</p>

<h3>The Sea Walls of Southern Jiangsu Are in Critical Condition</h3>
<p>Gao Yihan Comes to Shanghai Today for a Second Inspection</p>
<p>The Disaster Situation in the Four Counties of Taicang, Changshu, Songjiang, and Shanghai is the Most Critical</p>
<p>The Autumn Flood Season is Approaching, Urgent Measures Must Be Taken to Handle the Dangerous Sections</p>
<p>Supervisory Committee member Gao Yihan previously came to Shanghai to inspect the situation in Baoshan, Taicang, and other counties because most of the sea walls in southern Jiangsu have collapsed and the situation is critical. He determined that the sea walls in those areas were indeed dangerous. After the inspection, Gao reported the critical situation to the central government and presented detailed suggestions for ways to remedy the situation. Gao also planned to come to Shanghai for a second inspection, details of which are described below:</p>
<h3>The Critical Condition of the Sea Walls in Southern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>Gao Yihan submitted a report to the central government, stating the situation of saving the sea walls in southern Jiangsu, saying: "The sea walls of southern Jiangsu, including Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, have a total length of more than 500 li within Jiangsu province. They surround the borders of the nine counties of Changshu, Taicang, Baoshan, Shanghai City, Chuansha, Nanhui, Fengxian, Songjiang, and Jinshan, protecting more than 12 million mu of coastal farmland. The average harvest per mu is calculated at 10 yuan, so the annual harvest should be more than 120 million yuan. All the resources of the Wu-Yue plain depend on this line of sea walls for protection. During the Qing Dynasty, when the sea walls collapsed, seawater rushed directly to the Suzhou area. Therefore, since the former Qing Dynasty, the sea wall construction costs have been paid from the national treasury. In the fourth year of the Republic of China, a loan of 300,000 yuan was taken from the central tax deed funds to carry out repairs. Since the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, although the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department's budget included sea wall construction costs, except for dangerous sections, the full amount was not allocated. Therefore, the main construction of the sea walls has not been carried out for many years, the slopes have collapsed, and the stone work has also collapsed. As a result, after the great typhoon in August of the twentieth year, the sea walls of the four counties of Baoshan, Taicang, Changshu, and Songjiang successively experienced problems. From June to September of the twenty-first year, the Southern Jiangsu Sea Wall Post-Disaster Committee carried out the main construction of the sea walls, using a total of more than 750,000 yuan in construction costs to build pile stone work and reinforced concrete work, totaling more than 2,500 zhang in length. However, the original three-pile three-stone projects were either not carried out or were changed to two-pile two-stone projects. As of July of this year, the number of unrepaired projects and newly collapsed projects has increased daily. The most critical areas include the four counties of Baoshan, Taicang, Changshu, and Songjiang. The dangerous sections that need to be repaired urgently in Baoshan and Taicang counties include: Gu Longdun dike protection project in Baoshan County 470 (meters) (the same below), Zhangjiazhai north dike protection project 387, Xuejiatan dike protection project 29, Chuchengjing dike protection project 122, and Sanjianyanjing burlap bag project 90, totaling 1,161 meters. The Yuebingtai south dike protection project in Taicang County 60 (meters), Yuebingtai north rubble project 180, Damaodou rubble project 40, Daotangmiao rubble project 40, Yanglinkou dike protection project 60, and Qianjingkou dike protection project 30, totaling 410 meters. All of the above dangerous sections have been inspected. For example, the original top of the dikes at Zhangjiazhai, Xuejiatan, Yuebingtai, and Daotangmiao was three zhang, but now some have collapsed to more than one-third, leaving only four meters. If immediate rescue is not carried out, they will collapse in the event of a large wave. These dangerous and urgent projects have been estimated by engineer Zhang Gongjie, commissioned by the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department, to require 45,000 yuan, and it is heard that they have been approved by the provincial government and will be carried out quickly. In addition, there are the main construction projects of the sea walls in the four counties of Baoshan, Taicang, Changshu, and Songjiang, which were approved by the Southern Jiangsu Sea Wall Post-Disaster Committee last year but have not been carried out. Baoshan County needs about 100,000 yuan, Taicang County needs about 80,000 yuan, Songjiang County needs about 280,000 yuan, and Changshu County needs about 120,000 yuan, totaling about 580,000 yuan for the four counties. If they are not repaired, they will immediately become dangerous sections within one or two years. If we wait until they are in danger before repairing them, the cost will be ten or a hundred times higher than the current cost, and the losses to the people are not included. This is what the central government should immediately find a way to remedy and cannot delay for a moment."</p>
<h3>Gao Comes to Shanghai for a Second Inspection</h3>
<p>Because the autumn flood season is approaching, and the authorities have not yet started to repair the sea walls in southern Jiangsu, Gao Yihan plans to come to Shanghai from Suzhou today (the 17th) and go to Baoshan, Taicang, and other counties for a second inspection. At the same time, he will urge the responsible authorities to quickly allocate funds to handle the dangerous sections, in order to rescue them in case of emergency and to emphasize flood prevention work.</p>
<p>Ministry of Communications Expands</p>
<h3>Coastal Radio Station</h3>
<p>Can Communicate with Airplanes and Ships Worldwide</p>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports that the Shanghai Coastal Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications, formerly the Wusong Coastal Radio Station, which was destroyed in the January 28 Incident and moved to Shanghai for reorganization, is being expanded by the Ministry of Communications due to the importance of coastal radio stations and because Shanghai is a major trading port. Therefore, the Ministry of Communications is expanding the radio station, setting up a transmitting station at Fenglin Bridge, a receiving station at Hongqiao Road, and the general office at No. 230 Sassoon Building on Renji Road. The general receiving and transmitting office is also located in the Sassoon Building on Renji Road, and a branch receiving and transmitting office is located on Avenue Edward VII. It is equipped with three of the latest type of modulated wave radio transmitters, complete with long and short waves, which can directly communicate with airplanes and ships worldwide. The station's engineer, Situ Shangyi, the reporting director, Ge Chenglu, and the foreman, Chen Zhaorong, are very experienced in mechanical reporting. The station's reporting staff are also technically skilled. The station is large in scale, perfectly organized, and is the only coastal radio station in East Asia.</p>
<p>French Radio Station From Yesterday</p>
<h3>Stops Receiving and Transmitting Commercial Telegrams</h3>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports that the French radio station illegally set up in Shanghai was originally used to broadcast weather reports, but then it began to receive and transmit commercial telegrams, infringing on our country's rights. Our government has made representations over the years, and it finally stopped receiving and transmitting commercial telegrams on June 16, 1931. However, when the January 28 Incident occurred and the Japanese destroyed our Wusong radio station, the French took the opportunity to resume receiving and transmitting commercial telegrams, and even intensified their efforts, competing by lowering prices. Recently, our government, with conclusive evidence, has made serious representations to the French Minister, the French government, and the International Radio Union. As a result, it was decided that the station was not allowed to receive and transmit commercial telegrams. Yesterday, the station issued a notice to various shipping companies stating that it would stop receiving and transmitting commercial telegrams from 0:00 on the 16th of this month and would only broadcast weather reports.</p>
<h3>Investigating National Salvation Donations</h3>
<p>Letters from Various Parties</p>
<p>The Donation Investigation Committee Asks for Account Statements to Be Sent</p>
<p>Xin Sheng Society reports that the National Salvation Donation Investigation Committee of All Circles resolved at its fourth regular meeting the other day to announce that the account statements of all donation organizations that handled donations must be sent to the committee for investigation within a limited time. Yesterday, it sent letters to the Local Association, the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, the Northeast Refugee Relief Association, the Liaojihei-Rehe Volunteer Army Support Association, various charitable organizations, the Joint Relief Association for Northeast Refugees, and Shi Liangcai, Chu Fucheng, Zhu Qinglan, etc., stating: "Dear Sirs, At the request of the people of all circles, our committee was jointly organized by fifteen legal entities in this city and is fully responsible for thoroughly investigating the accounts of all organizations that have raised national salvation donations. It has been approved by the party and government organs of this city for filing. Now, at the fourth regular meeting of our committee, it was resolved to announce in the newspapers that your association must send all account statements, receipts, etc. for donations received and spent by your association to our committee by August 23 for investigation and to clarify the facts. This matter concerns your association's social reputation and the donations of the people. Please do not hesitate or delay, lest you cause yourself trouble. In addition to a separate announcement in the newspapers, this letter is sent to you for your information. Please take note and act accordingly."</p>
<p>The Northeast Support Association Asks for the Donation to Be Published</p>
<p>Xin Sheng Society reports that Shen Zuru, Zhang Yichen, Chen Peide, and more than ten other directors of the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association of this port sent a letter to Zhu Qinglan yesterday, stating: "Since the September 18 Incident, you have been running around in the north and south raising donations. The people of the whole country feel the depth of the national crisis and your enthusiasm. Compatriots at home and abroad have tightened their belts and enthusiastically donated. The donations before and after amount to no less than 20 million yuan. When General Ma Zhanshan arrived in Shanghai this time, he announced that he had received only more than 1.7 million yuan. Rumors spread, and there was a lot of controversy. The target of the criticism was you, and you were suspected. We have not dared to believe it. There are many so-called celebrities in Shanghai who use the name of charity and national salvation to enrich themselves and be selfish. However, we have not dared to consider you in the same light. However, General Li Du asked you in a telegram about the so-called four-six split of accounts and using funds to run schools. This came from General Li Du's mouth and can be considered credible history. The accounts of the Relief Association and other accounts handled by you have been delayed for years and have not been published, causing more suspicion among the public. We love you deeply and do not want your reputation to be damaged. We hope that you will preserve your reputation in your later years and quickly publish the detailed accounts of the Support Association, the original receipts, and other donations in order to show good faith. This is a frank statement, and we hope you will understand and take note. Sincerely, Shen Zuru, Zhang Yichen, Chen Peide, and more than ten other directors of the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, August 16."</p>
<p>Pan Xulun Asks for the Basis of the Total Amount According to Yesterday's Newspaper Report, the National Salvation Donation Investigation Committee of All Circles of this city stated in a telegram to the government, "The total amount of donations from various ports at home and abroad to aid the Northeast Volunteer Army should be no less than 20 to 30 million yuan." Accountant Pan Xulun believes that this total amount was previously only street talk and irresponsible rumors. Now that it has appeared in an official telegram from a formal auditing agency to the government, there must be a definite source. Therefore, he sent a letter to the National Salvation Donation Investigation Committee, asking for the basis of this estimated total amount and requesting that it be quickly published. The original letter from Accountant Pan is recorded below: "Dear Sirs, I have read in the newspaper on the 16th of this month that your committee presented a telegram to the central government requesting that the court investigate and prosecute national salvation donations, stating, 'The total amount of donations from various ports at home and abroad to aid the Northeast Volunteer Army should be no less than 20 to 30 million yuan.' I believe that your committee is organized by various formal public organizations in this city and has been approved by the party and government organs for filing. It can be called a formal public organization for investigating anti-Japanese donations. All statements should bear a major responsibility and should not rely on street talk as a basis for credibility. Now that you have made this affirmative statement in a public telegram to the government, there is no need to say that you have a correct basis. Please immediately publish the facts obtained by your committee regarding the 'donations to aid the Northeast Volunteer Army of no less than 20 to 30 million yuan.' Not only will the inspection of the accounts of various organizations begin, but it will also be possible to know for sure that there is a huge amount of corruption. Wouldn't this be a great thing? For the sake of maintaining social credit, I dare not remain silent about your committee's extremely important statement. Therefore, I have sent a special letter to inquire, and I hope to receive a reply. Respectfully, Accountant Pan Xulun to the National Salvation Donation Investigation Committee of All Circles of Shanghai, August 16, 1933."</p>

<p>The City Chamber of Commerce Investigates and Replies</p>
<h3>The Kangtai Factory is a Japanese Business</h3>
<p>A Letter Asking Overseas Chinese Merchants Not to Be Fooled</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Consul General in Manila yesterday, stating, "We received your letter regarding whether the yarn shirts purchased by Tongdehao, an importer in Cebu, were produced by the Shanghai Kangtai Factory or were Japanese goods, and entrusted us to investigate and reply as soon as possible. The Shanghai Kangtai Velvet Factory was opened by the Japanese in Shanghai in the eleventh year of the Republic of China. It falsely claimed to be a national product to the outside world. The former Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the China National Products Maintenance Association to investigate and confirm the facts. All newspapers reported this at that time. In the twenty-first year of the Republic of China, the goods were secretly sold in the Nanyang Islands. For example, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in South Camarines Province, the Philippine Saraya Overseas Chinese National Salvation Association, and the Philippine Legazpi Overseas Chinese National Salvation Support Association all sent letters to our chamber to investigate. To be cautious, we also forwarded the request to the Knitting Industry Association for investigation. According to the reply, there is no such factory in the same industry. The people near the factory all know that it was established by the Japanese. When communicating by telephone, the people who answered were all Japanese. All of this has been reported back. At that time, the Social Bureau also sent personnel to investigate the factory at No. 1080 Huade Road and confirmed that it was established by Japanese merchants who were using Chinese merchant brands. The matter was also reported to the municipal government and forwarded to the Ministry of Industry for verification. We initially thought that after this investigation and reply, the factory's skills of deception would be difficult to implement again. Why do overseas Chinese still mistakenly believe that it is a national product? This is regrettable. Accordingly, we are returning the original documents and sending a letter in reply. Please take note and act accordingly, and announce it to your overseas Chinese compatriots so that they will not be fooled again."</p>
<p>The Ten Factories of Gongzu, Sanyang, etc.</p>
<h3>Making Falsehoods is a Waste of Effort</h3>
<p>The Truth About Privately Importing Inferior Goods and Falsifying Tax Bills</p>
<p>Xin Sheng Society reports that the ten factories of Gongzu Socks Factory, Sanyang Cotton Weaving Factory, Jiuyi Weaving Factory, Dingxin Cloth Factory, etc., in this port have recently been sued by the Shenxin No. 5 Cotton Mill in the First Special District Court for purchasing Japanese goods and falsifying tax bills from the Shenxin No. 5 Cotton Mill. The truth of the case has now been investigated as follows:</p>
<h3>Inferior Goods Are Cheap</h3>
<p>Since the September 18 Incident, inferior goods on the market have been secretly sold at reduced prices due to the impact of the boycott. Taking yarn as an example, the market price of inferior goods is often 20 to 30 yuan cheaper per piece than the market price of domestic goods. Therefore, various cotton mills in this port still secretly import inferior goods. However, it is impossible to distinguish whether the yarn woven into finished products is domestic or foreign. However, when the products are sent to the Ministry of Finance's Unified Tax Bureau for shipment, the tax bills for the imported raw materials must be presented at the same time in accordance with the procedures. In order to avoid social attention, the manufacturers who privately import inferior goods privately altered the tax bills to the names of Chinese yarn mills. The method of alteration is to use a kind of medicine to slightly scrub the paper, which can wash away the handwriting. Therefore, in the past two years, the Unified Tax Bureau has been deceived into believing that no less than tens of thousands of pieces of yarn, worth more than 10 million yuan, have been altered.</p>
<h3>Altering Tax Bills</h3>
<p>Recently, Gongzu, Sanyang, and other factories still used the aforementioned altered tax bills to report to the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Unified Tax Bureau for shipment. Unexpectedly, the bureau discovered that the tax bills from the Japanese Dakang Yarn Factory were altered to tax bills from the Shenxin No. 5 Cotton Mill. Not only was the altered handwriting obvious, but the most telling thing was the mismatch between the seal of the Unified Tax Bureau office on the tax bill. The reason is that the Unified Tax Bureau sends special commissioners to each yarn mill to collect yarn taxes. Tax bills are issued for those that have been taxed, and the seal of the commissioner is affixed to the tax bill. The commissioner whose seal was affixed to the false tax bill discovered this time was sent by the Unified Tax Bureau to the Dakang Yarn Factory and not to the Shenxin No. 5 Cotton Mill. Therefore, there is no doubt that the tax bill was altered.</p>
<h3>The Tax Bureau Investigates</h3>
<p>After the Unified Tax Bureau discovered this, it summoned the managers of the ten factories of Gongzu, Sanyang, etc. for questioning. The factories admitted that the evidence was conclusive and could not be denied. In addition to reporting the details of the case to the Unified Tax Agency for verification, the bureau also notified the Shenxin No. 5 Cotton Mill to file a lawsuit in accordance with the law. The three official letters are recorded below: (1) The Sanyang, Gongzu, Yongyuan, and Jiuyi weaving factories submitted seven tax payment certificates for cotton yarn from the Shenxin No. 5 Cotton Mill to the bureau and requested that shipping permits be issued. Upon inspection of the tax payment certificates, the factory name and brand name on the certificates all showed signs of alteration and should be thoroughly investigated and punished in accordance with the regulations. A meeting is scheduled for 3:00 PM on August 1 to review the case. In addition to notifying each factory to send a responsible representative to the bureau at that time to state their reasons, this letter is sent to your yarn mill for your information. Please send a representative to the bureau at that time to participate in the review and state your opinions. Please do not delay. (2) The case of Sanyang and eight other single-industry weaving factories altering the factory name and brand name on the tax payment certificates. The bureau previously received a statement from Hu Qingsheng and Rong Huachen, representatives of your factory, stating that the Shenxin No. 5 Cotton Mill believes that the act of altering tax certificates by each weaving factory interferes with its business and intends to file a lawsuit in accordance with the law. In addition to the part that violates the Unified Tax Regulations, which has been drafted by this bureau and submitted to the Tax Agency for verification, the factory names, addresses, and tax certificate numbers of each weaving factory that altered the tax certificates are listed in a separate document and sent to your factory for verification. (Clear list omitted) (3) Dear Sirs, The review of the case of Sanyang and eight other single-industry weaving factories using altered tax payment certificates. After a meeting was held to review the case, the factory names and tax certificate numbers of each factory have been listed in a separate document and sent to you for verification. It is now continued that the Junchang and Yingzhou Dyeing and Weaving Factories submitted two tax payment certificates. Upon verification, both are tax certificates for five bales of Dakang Factory's Limapaib yarn, altered to the words "Shenxin No. 5 Cotton Mill, Ren Zhong Pai". The situation is the same as in the previous case and should be handled in accordance with the case. In addition to detaining the submitted tax certificates, a separate document is sent to your yarn mill for verification. To the Shenxin No. 5 Cotton Mill,</p>
<p>Ministry of Communications Electric Machinery Factory</p>
<h3>Yesterday Received Order to Cease Operations</h3>
<p>Employees Given One Month's Salary and Dismissed</p>
<p>Workers Petitioned for Submission to the Ministry for Resumption of Work</p>
<p>Yesterday Went to Party and Government Organs to Petition</p>
<p>According to the Hua Dong News Agency, the Ministry of Communications Telecommunications Machinery Manufacturing Plant in Zhoujiadu, Pudong, has suddenly received an order from the Ministry of Communications to cease operations and to close down by the end of the month. All employees are to be dismissed. The plant, upon receiving the order, has complied and ceased operations. However, all the workers, believing that the cessation of operations is unwarranted and their livelihoods are at stake, have specifically requested the Ministry of Communications to resume operations and have petitioned various government organs. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Plant Situation</h3>
<p>The plant was originally named the Battery Factory and was built in Zhoujiadu, Pudong, in the fifth year of the Republic of China to specialize in the production of batteries for various telecommunications bureaus under the Ministry of Communications. Several new buildings were added the year before last. After their completion, the plant was expanded and merged with the two sections of the Wenjisi Tuolu plant, renaming it the Ministry of Communications Telecommunications Machinery Manufacturing Plant. Internally, it was divided into the first, second, and third workshops. In addition to batteries, various wired and wireless electrical components were also manufactured, with satisfactory results. The past factory directors were Lu Guixiang and Yu Runsheng. The current director is Mr. Yu Ruxin.</p>
<h3>Successive Inspections</h3>
<p>A few months ago, the Ministry of Communications, in order to rectify the national telecommunications administration, sent personnel to the plant for inspection several times. The inspecting personnel successively submitted the results of their inspections to the Ministry of Communications. The plant director, Yu Ruxin, had previously submitted his resignation to the Ministry of Communications, but it has not yet been approved. Therefore, Mr. Yu continues to report to the plant for work as usual.</p>
<h3>Ministry Order to Cease Operations</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday, Monday, Director Yu suddenly received an order from the Ministry of Communications to cease operations at the plant. It stated, in essence, that repeated reports indicated that the plant's internal operations were severely lacking and that it should be closed down immediately by the end of the month for improvement. All employees, except for telegraph technicians and operators, who should be reassigned after the completion of the closure, should be dismissed, each receiving one month's salary as severance pay. All registers and reports should be completed by the end of August. The technicians from various provinces who were sent to the plant for training and learning should be given travel expenses and ordered to return to their original bureaus. Compliance was required.</p>
<h3>Plant Notice</h3>
<p>Upon receiving the instructions, Mr. Yu immediately issued two notices: (1) Notice: In accordance with Instruction No. 4197 of the Ministry of Communications (omission)...Reporting, etc. Therefore, this plant should comply and issue a notice for general knowledge. (2) This plant is ordered to close. All employees are prohibited from taking any items out of the plant without the permission of the responsible personnel.</p>
<h3>Work Has Stopped</h3>
<p>However, it was already after work hours, so the workers were not yet aware. It wasn't until the previous morning, when the workers went to the plant to work, that they saw the notice and were unable to work. They immediately raised two points and asked Director Yu for a response: (1) Request an announcement of the reasons for the dismissal. (2) Request the sealing of the workshop doors. Director Yu replied that the first point was by order of the Ministry, and he was unaware of the reason. He would only know after going to Beijing to meet with the authorities. As for the second point, the workshop doors would be sealed, but the storage areas for materials had not yet been sealed.</p>
<h3>Petition for Resumption of Work</h3>
<p>All the workers of the plant specially drafted a petition to the Ministry of Communications requesting resumption of work in order to maintain their livelihoods. The original petition has been submitted to Director Yu. The original petition stated in essence: Submitted to the Ministry: Recently, Instruction No. 4197 of the Ministry stated that repeated reports indicated that the plant's internal operations were severely lacking and that it should be closed down immediately by the end of the month, etc. Upon receiving this, we find that if the technicians have made any mistakes, the regulations provide for it. Moreover, the technicians are mostly from this plant's training program and specialize in the manufacture of various telecommunications machines. If they were to lose their jobs, it would be difficult to make a living and would be a disservice to the Ministry's cultivation. Furthermore, the government is currently trying to find ways to relieve unemployment. Now, the Ministry suddenly orders the cessation of work and dismissal. The technicians are extremely apprehensive upon receiving the order. As for the deficiencies in internal operations, this is not the fault of the technicians. Moreover, the technicians have all been approved by the Ministry and there are no dismissal clauses in the regulations. Therefore, we can only request the director to forward this to the Ministry to withdraw the order and allow resumption of work, in order to maintain the livelihoods of the more than one hundred technicians. We submit this with utmost urgency, awaiting orders. Respectfully submitted by the plant director Yu, followed by the names of all the workers.</p>

<h3>Peichang Ironworks Statement</h3>
<p>Promoting Domestically Produced Pig Iron</p>
<p>Peichang Is Not Peixi</p>
<p>Peichang Ironworks sent a letter to this newspaper yesterday stating: "Dear Sir, Having read the article in your newspaper's local news section on the 13th of this month, in which the Shanghai Iron and Steel Machinery Industry Association published a discussion on promoting domestically produced iron, the content of the discussion, which promotes the sale of pig iron from the Liuhegou mine, is in line with our company's promotion of Liuhegou pig iron over the years. The reference to Japanese iron dumping and manipulation by unscrupulous merchants refers to something else. However, the origin of this discussion, as stated in your newspaper, is due to the 'Blood Soul Eradication Group' pointing out that Peichang and Sutai Ironworks were privately selling Japanese iron and sending a letter of inquiry. Peichang dares to say that its patriotism is no less than others. Now, the accusation of privately selling Japanese iron has been published in the newspaper. Although the accusation is unsubstantiated, misunderstandings are unavoidable. We have no choice but to have your newspaper publish the true situation of Peichang's iron sales in order to clarify the truth. Since the September 18th Incident, all Chinese people, unless they are insane, would be willing to cooperate with the Japanese. The pig iron sold by Peichang is either domestically produced from Liuhegou or Indian produced and sold by the British firm Jinlong Trading Company. We prefer to specialize in the sale of domestically produced Liuhegou pig iron. Therefore, when Liuhegou started its furnace, we immediately ordered 1,000 tons, then 5,000 tons, then 600 tons, then 200 tons, then 2,600 tons, then 3,000 tons. There was an oral agreement to be the exclusive seller until the end of September. In fact, the amount sold to other parties midway was also significant. Therefore, Peichang only obtained 12,000 tons. As for the Indian pig iron from the British firm Jinlong Trading Company, Peichang's sales were quite small. However, this iron is not only not Japanese goods, but also not sold by Japanese merchants. This can be seen by referring to the latter part of the advertisement published by the Shanghai Iron and Steel Machinery Industry Association on the 4th of this month and the advertisement by the British firm Jinlong Trading Company on the 5th of this month. In summary, Peichang was the earliest to promote domestic goods and the firmest in resisting Japanese goods. To say that we privately sell Japanese goods in the autumn of national crisis is a great injustice. Since the rumor of privately selling Japanese goods has been spread in the newspaper, the true facts must also be published in the same newspaper. Therefore, we have listed the above situation and respectfully ask your newspaper to publish our letter so that Peichang's reputation and business will not be damaged for no reason. We would be most fortunate. Furthermore, the article published in your newspaper on the 14th of this month regarding the Shanghai Iron and Steel Machinery Industry Association discovering contraband goods at the Peichang factory, the so-called Peichang factory, is not the same company as our Peichang Ironworks. Moreover, the factory's logo is the character 培, which may cause confusion. We combine this with the above statement. Sincerely, Peichang Ironworks, Shenbei, Shanghai Newspaper Office. August 16, 22nd year of the Republic of China."</p>
<h3>Ma Hongbin Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday from Lu</h3>

He went to Lu at the invitation of Chairman Jiang to meet with Mr. Jiang and give a detailed account of the recent military and political situation in Ningxia. He also asked Mr. Jiang for instructions on everything. It is said that Mr. Ma stayed in Lu for a total of four weeks and then went to Nanjing to meet with important figures such as President Wang. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Nanjing.</p>
<h3>The Resolution of the Tiānchú Aircraft Damage</h3>
<p>Original Aircraft Repaired and Propeller Replaced, etc.</p>
<p>Another Trainer Aircraft Donated to the Aviation Society</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the all-metal fighter aircraft donated solely by Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory was ordered from the German Junkers factory. However, after arriving in Shanghai, before delivery, it was damaged during a test flight by a German pilot hired by the seller. After repeated negotiations with the seller by the Tianchu factory to replace the aircraft with a new one, the seller was only willing to be responsible for the repair, and the stalemate lasted for a month. Recently, the Tianchu factory requested the aviation authorities to send senior specialists to thoroughly inspect the extent of the damage in order to determine the negotiation strategy. Mao Bangchu, the principal of the Central Aviation School, appointed Wang Boxiu, the factory director, to come to Shanghai to assist in the negotiations. Mr. Wang flew from Hangzhou to Shanghai and, after landing at Hongqiao, conducted a lengthy inspection. The result was that the aircraft was strong in quality, so important parts such as the engine were not damaged. He then summoned the representatives of the Tianchu factory and the Junkers factory, the Chansen Trading Company, and proposed a solution: the seller would be responsible for the repair, and damaged parts such as the propeller, wheels, and fuel tank would be replaced with new ones. After the replacement, the test flight procedures would still be carried out in accordance with the original contract, and then the delivery would be formally completed. The Tianchu factory believed that as long as all the standards could be met after the replacement, it was reasonable. Subsequently, the issue of interest on the paid purchase price and the loss of delayed delivery was discussed for a long time. The Tianchu factory's intention was that although such requests were justified, it did not want to recover part of the donation, so the Junkers factory should seek a more beneficial solution for the Chinese aviation community. Then, Factory Director Wang proposed that the Junkers factory deliver an all-metal A50 80-horsepower trainer aircraft, which is now being transported to China for sale, to the Tianchu factory without compensation. Chansen Trading Company believed that the value of the aircraft was as high as 8,000 US dollars and could not agree to it. Factory Director Wang encouraged them to consider diplomatic relations and commercial credit, and then telegraphed the Junkers factory back and forth before making a decision. However, they were unwilling to be fully responsible for the assembly and test flight, and requested the Tianchu factory to state in the contract that the recipient would be responsible. Factory Director Wang generously agreed to assist, so the stalemate of one month was resolved. The contract will be signed within one or two days. The parts that need to be replaced on the fighter aircraft have been telegraphed to Germany for urgent transportation to China. It is said that the factory originally wanted to sell the trainer aircraft to the North China authorities, so it is now stored in a box in Peiping. The factory will send a letter to the Aviation School to send personnel to Peiping to assemble it and fly it to Shanghai. It is also heard that the Tianchu factory intends to donate this trainer aircraft to the Flying Society affiliated with the China Aviation Association for the purpose of training aviation professionals. According to the current negotiations, the Tianchu factory believed that it was not a matter for one factory, so it would not give in. The seller's losses were too great, so it did not want to admit it easily. The opinions of both sides were not easy to reconcile. However, Factory Director Wang put forward a very reasonable solution with a very sincere attitude, so this satisfactory result was achieved, which was unexpected. It is said that the Tianchu factory always puts the interests of the country first, and the seller strives to maintain its credibility, which is beyond reach.</p>

<h3>Ministry Approves Responsibility of Railway Bureau</h3>
<p>However, the Consignment Note Issued by the Transfer Company Still Needs to Be Stamped</p>
<p>The Shanghai Transfer Industry Association previously submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance for approval to implement the responsibility of the railway bureau to affix stamp tax for railway bills of lading. Yesterday, it received Approval No. 3140 from the Ministry of Finance, stating, "All submissions received are noted. As the railway has stipulated responsible transportation measures, and the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways have fully implemented them, the railway bureau should be responsible for affixing stamp tax to the bills of lading or responsible cargo receipt issued by the railway bureau in the future. The association's request to exempt members from responsibility should be approved. In addition to informing the Ministry of Railways to order the railway bureau to comply with the affixing of stamp tax and ordering the Stamp Tax and Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureaus of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to take note, you should also be informed. The consignment note issued by each transfer company should still be stamped by the company in accordance with regulations and should not be mixed up in any way. You should also inform all members to comply." This concludes the approval.</p>

<p>North Jin Steamer</p>
<h3>Collided with and Sank Four Salt Boats in Dabu</h3>
<p>Salt Merchants Raise Claims for Compensation</p>
<p>North Jin Has Been Detained</p>
<p>The North Jin steamer of the Zhīdōng Company transported coal from North China to Dabu, Haizhou. While berthed at the dock in the port for unloading, it encountered a high tide and the hull was pushed to the center of the port, causing the Tóng Huá to lose its anchor due to its broken chain. The Zhengzhou steamer was also washed away from the dock. Four salt boats in the port were all sunk by the collision, resulting in heavy losses, causing the North Jin steamer to be detained by the local salt mound and a major dispute to arise. The situation is checked and recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>North Jin Encountered a Tide and Caused a Disaster</h3>
<p>The Zhīdōng Company's North Jin steamer transported coal from North China to Haizhou on the 11th of this month and arrived at the Dabu port for unloading. The North Jin steamer was berthed at the first dock in the Dabu port, and the China Merchants Bureau's Tóng Huá steamer was berthed at the second dock. Next to the Tóng Huá was the Hézhòng's Zhengzhou steamer. The tides in Dabu are very rapid, rising three feet at a time, which is feared by航轮. At that time, the high tide suddenly increased, and the hull of the North Jin was impacted by the surge, and the front of the ship was opened horizontally. If the stern cable had been cut at that time, it would not have caused a disaster. However, the stern cable of the North Jin was not cut, and the stern crashed into the Tóng Huá. The Tóng Huá was hit and also left the dock. The stern of the North Jin also destroyed the dock piles. The stern of the Tóng Huá was also stranded. The two anchors thrown by the bow were completely cut off and the large anchors were completely lost in the port. The Hézhòng's Zhengzhou steamer was also shocked and entered the port horizontally. For a time, the Dabu port became chaotic and uneasy.</p>
<h3>Four Salt Boats Overturned</h3>
<p>Outside the third dock,民船 carrying salt were all docked, ready to transport to various ships for transportation to various places along the Yangtze River. When the North Jin steamer was hit by the surging tide to the center of the port, the ships at the dock were also affected and left the dock one after another. The water in the port was both impacted by the surge and震动 by the ships, and the port water suddenly spun. At the time of confusion, the four装盐民船 outside the North Jin were wiped by the甩撃 of the North Jin, and all four salt boats overturned. Several thousand bags of salt loaded on the boats completely fell into the port. The boatmen of the civil ships also fell into the port. Fortunately, they were rescued immediately, but all the salt was lost without存, and the damage was extremely huge.</p>
<h3>Salt Merchants Detained the Ship and Negotiated</h3>
<p>After this incident, the sinking salt民船 boatmen reported to the cargo owners that the North Jin had caused the disaster and requested the North Jin steamer to compensate for the losses. The damaged dock also negotiated with the North Jin to repair it. The salt merchants said that the cost of the salt on the four ships was very large. After falling into the water, it melted and was completely sacrificed. The ship that caused the disaster should be responsible. At that time, the Dabu police were reported to detain the North Jin steamer and not allow it to leave the port until the issue of the sunken salt boat had been negotiated and a result had been obtained before it could be released. The matter has been seriously negotiated with the Zhīdōng Company.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Bureau Responsible for Salvaging Anchor Chains</h3>
<p>The two anchors and铁练 lost by the Tóng Huá due to the collision by the North Jin were of great value, about nearly ten thousand yuan. At that time, the Tóng Huá tried to salvage it repeatedly but failed to retrieve it. As a result, it opened and returned to Shanghai. The shipowner reported to the head office. The China Merchants Bureau has sent a letter to the Zhīdōng Steamship Company, ordering it to salvage the two iron anchors lost by the Tóng Huá steamer in the Dabu port on its behalf. If the bureau salvages it, the loss shall be borne by the company.</p>
<h3>Zhu Jiqing Returns North Tonight</h3>
<p>Zhu Jiqing, the Director-General of the Northeast National Salvation Army, came to Shanghai a few days ago to announce the income and expenditure accounts of donations from various parties. He also hosted banquets for the collectors of donations in Shanghai the day before yesterday. He has completed his official duties and is scheduled to take the night train to Beijing tonight and then go to North China to wait for an opportunity to carry out anti-Japanese work.</p>
<p>A Major Criminal in the Assassination Attempt on Song Ziwen</p>
<h3>Niu Jinpu Escaped from Prison</h3>
<p>Zhou Zhizhang, Wang Shuchiao, Hong Yaodou, Niu Jinpu and other four criminals who had attempted to assassinate Minister of Finance Song Ziwen at the North Station, killing Song's secretary Tang Yulu, and assassinating Zhao Tieqiao, the Director of the China Merchants Bureau, were discovered by the Old Gate Patrol Room of the Public Concession and then investigated by the Municipal Public Security Bureau. On the 18th of last month, they requested the First Special District Court to transfer them for questioning, so as to confront the two criminals, Long Lin and Tang Ming, who had already been arrested. Although the patrol room lawyer Ru Bao-yi and the defendant's lawyer vigorously opposed it at the time, the court only approved the transfer after the repeated requests of Zhan Ji-feng, the representative lawyer of the Public Security Bureau. However, it was limited to three days, and they had to be sent back to the patrol room. Therefore, the four criminals were escorted to the Public Security Bureau by the head of the detective team, Gao Wansheng. However, after the criminals were transferred to the bureau, Director Wen treated them very well and imprisoned them in the third squad of the nearby Vulcan Temple. However, as a precaution, all four criminals were nailed with large-sized leg shackles. A total of seven people were held there. Unexpectedly, Niu Jinpu, one of the four criminals, had long been thinking of escaping from prison and found a way to file off the leg shackles. At about 11:00 p.m. the night before last (the 15th), Niu犯 suddenly wanted to poop and was accompanied by an armed squad soldier. After waiting for a long time, he did not come out. When he re-entered the toilet to check, Niu had disappeared without a trace, and the filed shackles were abandoned on the side of the toilet. The squad soldier was extremely horrified and immediately reported to Meng Xianqi, the captain of the squad, who immediately dispatched all the squad soldiers to round up the area. However, he had already fled far away. He immediately reported to the director. Director Wen, upon hearing the news, immediately drove from his residence to personally inspect the traces. Only then did he realize that the criminal had climbed the wooden post on the west side of the toilet, climbed to the roof, and jumped to the alley next door to escape. He immediately ordered his subordinates to arrest him strictly.</p>

<p>Public Notice from the Public Works, Public Security, and Public Utilities Bureaus</p>
<h3>Prohibiting Rascals from Extorting at the Docks</h3>
<p>Xing Zhigang, a representative of the shipowners in Pudong West, had previously submitted a request to the Municipal Public Works Bureau, voluntarily paying the fee, requesting the construction of the Nanhui Hall Dock, and begging to eliminate the bad habits of rascals extorting and collecting the rule in order to maintain shipping and other situations. Yesterday, the Municipal Public Works, Public Security, and Public Utilities Bureaus issued a joint notice as follows: For the purpose of issuing a notice, it has been found that all public docks in South Shanghai of this city are in accordance with Article 3 of the Regulations on the Management of Public Docks in this city. All ships docked at public docks, except for public steamer docks, are not charged. However, it has recently been reported by shipowner representative Xing Zhigang and others to this Public Works Bureau that rascals are extorting and collecting the rule and obstructing the loading and unloading of goods at the South Shanghai Hall Dock. It has also been jointly reported by the Public Security and Public Utilities Bureaus, which have sent personnel to investigate. It is true that there are rascals in the dock who are setting up houses to collect fees. This should be strictly prohibited in order to facilitate transportation. In addition to the fact that the Public Security Bureau has arrested Jing Yihe, a rascal who set up a house to collect fees, and transferred him to the court for punishment, and set up a public dock management rule and enamel sign on the site for compliance, it is hereby announced for public knowledge. In the future, if there are local rascals who dare to collect the rule without authorization and obstruct the loading and unloading of goods, all shipowners shall be allowed to hand them over to the water patrol team for strict handling in order to show deterrence. This concludes the notice.</p>

<h3>Bansong Garden Will Hold a Garden Tour</h3>
<p>Yu Ji Company Holds the Venue</p>
<p>Scheduled to Be Held from the 25th</p>
<p>In recent years, the number of citizens in South Shanghai has been increasing, and the market development has also been progressing. However, there is a lack of public entertainment venues, which makes the citizens living in South Shanghai feel that they lack a proper place to消遣 after work. Even if they occasionally go out for sightseeing, they have to go to the concession. Long-distance travel is quite inconvenient, and Nanshi must also have the necessity to revitalize the market and develop entertainment venues to compete with the concession for the same prosperity. Therefore, Yu Ji Company in this city, in view of the above situation, paid attention to this point and was determined to seek happiness for the society at the expense of sacrifice and without fear of difficulties. In order to thoroughly revitalize the Nanshi market, the first step of the plan is to hold a游艺大会 at Bansong Garden, the first scenic spot in South Shanghai. The date has been set on the 25th of this month, day and night. The due date is just the festival of the Double Stars Crossing the River. Good times and beautiful scenery, timely enjoyment, and it is heard that the company, in addition to collecting various novel, interesting, high-end and precious游艺 as much as possible to enhance雅兴, also plans to tie up a large number of seasonal lanterns. Standing in the midst of it, the fireworks are dazzling, the colored lights illuminate the city, and it is expected that the South Shanghai road will be crowded with people and仕女 at the due date. From then on, South Shanghai will have a high-end entertainment venue that is more热闹繁荣.</p>
<p>Fifth District Cigarette Workers Union</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Representative Meeting</h3>
<p>Scheduled for Petitioning the City Government Today</p>
<p>The Shanghai Fifth District Cigarette Industry Workers' Union held an emergency representative meeting yesterday at 5:00 PM. 127 representatives attended. The presidium consisted of Chen Peide, Zhang Ziping, and Lou Jingguan. Sun Xiaozhu served as the recording secretary. Representatives from the city party headquarters, Lu Yinchu, and the Social Bureau, Wang Gang, were also present.

For the above cases, the assembly elected representatives to petition the city government tomorrow (i.e., today) to seek legal arbitration immediately. (5) The factory defied government orders and refused to reinstate Fang Fu, a long car worker from Xin Yin Chang. (6) Obstructing the collection of union dues in various departments. (7) Arbitrarily dismissing worker No. 146 from Lao Ye. For the above cases, a report will be submitted to the city party headquarters and Social Bureau for a reasoned appeal.

Subsequently, guidance was provided by higher-level representatives, and the meeting adjourned at 10:00 PM.</p>
<p>Union Declaration</p>
<p>Declaration of the Representative Assembly of the Shanghai Fifth District Cigarette Industry Workers' Union: This representative assembly affirms that the factory's recent measures have completely eliminated the possibility of labor-management cooperation, reverting to the hostile behaviors of the sixteenth year. The representatives and workers are in a precarious situation under the strict barriers of imperialist capitalists. Not wanting to witness the past tragedies again, and seeing that even repeated compromises are futile today, we cannot avoid the future expansion of the dispute to an unforeseeable degree. However, this representative assembly must declare its responsibility and make a concrete statement to all our workers and people from all walks of life. (The middle section lists nine points: amending the contract, refusing mediation, unilaterally setting factory rules, depriving benefits, illegally recording demerits, dismissing workers, defying orders, refusing reinstatement, violating the contract, undermining education, obstructing fee collection, suppressing the labor movement, refusing to pay wages during work stoppages, using spies to sow discord, and disrupting unity. The text is lengthy and omitted.) The above points are merely the most obvious; countless others are too numerous to list. The factory has always claimed to treat its workers generously, but facts now prove that it oppresses workers in the same way as other imperialist capitalists, with no significant difference. We, the representatives and all the workers, are at a critical juncture for survival, and can only prepare for the last stand with the greatest determination. Heads can be broken, bodies can be shattered, but as long as there is breath, this resolve will not change. This is our declaration.</p>
<p>Emergency Notice</p>
<p>The union's council intends to issue an emergency notice to all departments this morning, regarding the matter of an emergency notice. Based on the resolution of the representative assembly, during this turbulent period for labor and management, the membership certificates of workers in various departments may be lost or have incomplete stamps. Once an incident occurs, it will be impossible to rectify the situation. It was decided on the spot to task the organization section with consolidating them immediately. Therefore, a special notice is issued: If any worker has lost their membership certificate or lacks stamps, please report to their respective department representative for replacement to avoid problems. This is a special notice.</p>

<p>Huoshan County</p>
<h3>Gentry and People Send Letter of Thanks to the Red Swastika Society</h3>
<p>The World Red Swastika Society China Southeast Main Association Shanghai Office, previously, due to the discovery of over 10,000 bodies killed in Zhufuo Temple in Huoshan County, buried in the sand along the riverbank, the society, fearing that flash floods would wash the bodies into the Huai River and then into the Yangtze River basin, causing an epidemic, organized a large-scale burial team to re-excavate and bury the bodies submerged in sand. It is now heard that the local gentry and people of the county, Liu Yichen, Zhan Jinru, Hu Guan'san, Xie Dingchu, etc., have sent a letter of thanks to the Red Swastika Society. The original letter is recorded below. Respectfully, We, the people of Huoshan County, Zhufuo Temple, unfortunately fell victim to bandits in 1919, suffering three years of devastation. Over ten thousand were killed. The survivors fled to other places, displaced and homeless. Those killed were abandoned in the fields, their bones buried in the sand, a sight that saddened all who saw it and caused grief to all who spoke of it. It was not until the autumn of the following year that the national army recaptured the area, and the refugees were finally able to return. Without clothing or food, and with tears of despair, they anxiously awaited relief. Fortunately, your society's benevolence reached far and wide, sending officials with substantial funds to provide relief, enabling the dying to survive. The tens of thousands who were killed were also given new graves by your officials, who came with funds to rebury them, retrieving them from the water and sand. Severed heads, broken bones, and decaying corpses were all collected and buried. The tomb was named "Ten Thousand People's Tomb," and a stone monument and tomb pavilion were erected on their behalf, surrounded by trees and flowers, allowing the wronged souls of the ten thousand to rest in peace. Your society saves lives and comforts the dead, extending grace to the departed, and your great virtue and profound benevolence have won the hearts of all, both living and dead. We, the citizens, are filled with gratitude and hereby express our heartfelt thanks, and we present a map of the Ten Thousand People's Tomb as a permanent memorial, etc.</p>

<p>Requesting Transfer of Order to Shanghai Court for Swift Execution</p>
<p>The shutdown dispute at the San You Industrial Society General Factory in Pudong has been concluded through three trials and handed over to the Shanghai District Court for legal execution in accordance with the city government's arbitration decision.

<h3>Progress in the Box Corpse Case</h3>
<p>Sufficient Evidence to Prove the Defendant's Guilt</p>
<p>The Consular Corps Also Advocates Thorough Investigation</p>
<p>The box corpse case is currently under investigation after preliminary examination by the Portuguese Consulate. The latest news is recorded below.</p>
<h3>Important Evidence Seized</h3>
<p>Regarding the brutal murder of Cai Lian and the packing and shipping of the body by the two criminals, Badrel and Qiusifu, both steadfastly denied murder and abetting the crime during the preliminary hearing. Therefore, the Portuguese Consulate both returned the defendant and also, Consul Xue Erfo, together with Prosecutor Lixi and a forensic doctor, and also accompanied by police officers *Japanese police officers* etc. went to 15 Jiaxing Road and 174 Yifeng Li to conduct a detailed search. It is now heard that strong and important evidence has been seized in the house at 15 Jiaxing Road, sufficient to prove that Badrel was indeed the perpetrator. However, this evidence has not yet been allowed to be released.</p>
<h3>The Consular Corps Advocates Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Consular Corps also advocates a thorough investigation into the killing of a human life by the two Portuguese men. It is still necessary to investigate the rickshaw pullers who transported the body box at that time. Once the rickshaw pullers are found, they will also be able to provide considerable assistance in terms of witness testimony. The box containing the body is still at the Japanese Consulate and has not yet been taken to the police station.</p>
<h3>The Defendant's Lawyer States</h3>
<p>The lawyer hired by the defendant, Lun Gu, was selected from among all the Portuguese expatriates in Shanghai to defend the two defendants. He is currently asking the defendant for his opinion on the case to prepare for his defense. According to lawyer Lun Gu, Portugal has no death penalty. If the defendant is truly guilty, he will be transferred to Macau for trial. According to Portuguese law, a murderer is sentenced to 25 to 28 years of imprisonment, but must perform hard labor in the African colonies. The climate there is very hot, and most prisoners die within a few years. The formal trial is expected to begin around the 22nd to 24th. After the trial, a decision will be made to transfer them to Macau.</p>
<p>Strange Event in Yanglinkou, Wusong</p>
<h3>Escorting Pirates Suddenly Encountered Two Fires</h3>
<p>Circling Several Times, a Thunderclap Entered the Ship</p>
<p>Several People Were Injured and Suddenly Gathered in One Place</p>
<p>Zhu Songzhou, 43, from Hangzhou, Zhejiang, who previously served as the captain of the patrol team in the Tongzhou waters, was dismissed from his post. He then led his subordinates, about 200 people, to occupy Xiaoyangshan in the Nantong waters and became pirates. Countless ships were robbed. Last year, the Nantong Jiangsu Provincial Maritime Public Security Bureau sent a large number of water police to suppress them, but they were all repelled by the bandits. Since then, Zhu's forces have grown in strength, and his subordinates have increased from about 200 to over 1,000. Zhu himself has been hiding in Shanghai, living freely. On the 11th of this month, after a report, he was arrested by the French police at No. 5 Renyuanli, Grolier Road, and escorted to the Second Special Court for trial. After learning of this news, Nantong sent Dai Junqing, deputy director of the Fourth District Detective Team of the Jiangsu Provincial Maritime Public Security Bureau, to Shanghai to request transfer from the Second Special Court. Judge Wang Gangxi approved the request, and on the afternoon of the 13th, a civilian ship was hired to depart from the Bund. Unexpectedly, when the ship was about to reach Wusong, dark clouds suddenly gathered, and thunder rumbled. When it reached Yanglinkou, a strong wind and rain followed. At that time, the ship continued to move forward. Dai and two armed soldiers and two detectives were monitoring Zhu Songzhou in the cabin. At that time, the boatman steering the ship at the stern suddenly saw two fireballs coming straight towards the ship from the sky. When it reached the ship's surface, it suddenly circled around the ship. For a time, the entire ship was shocked, and passing ships did not dare to approach. At this time, Dai ordered them to stop. Unexpectedly, the two fireballs circled the ship several times, and then a</p>
<p>thunderclap was heard, and the sound of the ball entering the cabin. Dai's two soldiers were burned on their backs, and Zhu Songzhou's legs were also burned, with blisters all over, causing unbearable pain. At that time, the crew had entered the cabin and bandaged the injured people, but the two fireballs were becoming more and more urgent in the cabin. The strangest thing was another thunderclap, and the crowd suddenly gathered together, arranged very neatly. At this point, the two balls disappeared. The people in the boat looked at each other in astonishment, dumbfounded. At this time, the sky was clear and the dark clouds scattered. The boatman then untied the cable and sailed away. A strange drama also came to an end. The Dancing Queen, Wang Xiaomei</p>
<h3>Sues for Sending a Small Coffin</h3>
<p>Accuses Zhang Shuliang, an Employee of a Foreign Company, of Damaging His Reputation Without Cause</p>
<p>After the Coffin Was Sent, Bad Luck Immediately Struck, and He Became Ill</p>
<p>This Case Will Be Publicly Tried This Afternoon</p>
<p>Wang Xiaomei, the dancing queen of the Shanghai ballroom, is nineteen years old. Although her talent is not outstanding, her fashion sense is unparalleled. As a result, every evening there is fierce competition among those who love and hug her. The dancer believes that she is inspired by her art, and gradually looks down on everything, and the attitude towards the dance customers is inevitably somewhat uneven. Dance customers who have been snubbed often harbor resentment and are always thinking of venting, so</p>
<h3>Big Pranks</h3>
<p>emerge one after another. The dancer lives at No. 6 Siming Lane, Avenue Joffre, French Concession. One day, a tavern suddenly sent several tables of delicacies to her home. Another day, a car driver suddenly drove several cars to her home, all claiming to have been called. The dancer knew she was being made fun of, but she couldn't do anything about it. She had to pay the price of the food and the fares for the cars. This kind of monetary loss was like a mute eating huanglian, and she could only recognize her misfortune. The dancer is arrogant by nature, and although she has been repeatedly teased, she is still proud and arrogant. Therefore, one night on the 21st of last month, while driving in a car to cool off, when she drove past Yu Garden Road in West Shanghai, a car driven by an acquaintance used some tricks to make the two cars collide. Although neither of them was damaged, her heart was almost shattered. Unexpectedly, things got even stranger. A week after the car accident, on the morning of the 27th of last month, two people suddenly came to her house, carrying</p>
<h3>A Newly Made Small Wooden Coffin</h3>
<p>They said that someone had ordered it from the Xu Changxing Coffin Shop on Avenue Haig and that the coffin was to be delivered to your residence. They were ordered by the shop owner to bring the coffin and asked to pay the price of the coffin back to the shop for accounting. At that time, Wang Xiaomei was both surprised and hated, and she immediately blamed the two shop assistants who were carrying the coffin and sent them to the French Police Station, requesting that the instigators be investigated. At first, the two shop assistants could not state anything because they did not know the surname or residence of the person who ordered the coffin. The French Police Station also believed that there was no clue, so they ordered Wang Xiaomei to leave and wait for the investigation to be completed. From then on, the dancer</p>
<h3>Was Unhappy All Day Long</h3>
<p>and no longer appeared in the dance hall in the evening. Until the night of the 30th of last month, Zhang Shuliang, an employee of a certain foreign company, went to watch because a friend gave him a tea dance ticket for the Shanghai Ballroom, thinking that it would not cost him anything. Although Zhang was a handsome young man, he had never liked to set foot in dance halls and singing stages. That night was his first time watching the dance. As soon as he sat down, two strong men quickly approached him and, after looking at him slightly, said that a friend of yours was waiting to talk to you and asked you to go and meet him quickly. Zhang refused to go because he did not know the two men. However, he was pestered repeatedly, so he left his seat and followed them. When he arrived at the cloakroom of the dance hall, the two men's attitudes suddenly changed. They asked Zhang why</p>
<h3>He Bought a Coffin and Sent It to Wang Xiaomei's</h3>
<p>House. Zhang immediately denied that he had ever done such a thing. The two men then forced their reasons, trying to establish Zhang's actions as facts, which led to arguments. The patrolmen arrived after hearing the noise and took both parties to the Xinzha Police Station together. Wang Xiaomei and the people from Xu Changxing Coffin Shop also went to the police station. After the police chief questioned them one by one, Wang Xiaomei said that she had never met Zhang before, let alone had any grudges. The people from the coffin shop said that the person who ordered the coffin looked like Zhang, so they sent it to Wang's house at 11 a.m. that morning. Zhang immediately stated that the time the coffin was ordered and delivered, as stated by the people, was the time when he was working at the foreign company, and he asked the police chief to thoroughly investigate to avoid injustice. After reviewing the results, the police chief believed that Zhang Shuliang</p>
<h3>There Was No Definite Evidence</h3>
<p>regarding the coffin sending matter, so he dismissed everyone. After leaving the police station, Zhang thought to himself that he had never met Wang Xiaomei before, let alone had any enemies, but he was accused for no reason and deliberately framed. That day, he hired lawyer Chen Deming to send a letter to Wang Xiaomei for negotiation, requesting a written apology, otherwise he would resolve the matter legally to clarify the truth. However, the dancer not only refused to accept the conditions proposed by Zhang, but also took preemptive measures and hired lawyer Wu Peng to file a complaint with the First Special District Court, accusing Zhang of</p>
<h3>Damaging His Reputation Without Cause</h3>
<p>She said that Zhang had instructed people to send the small coffin and that the car accident on Yu Garden Road on the night of July 21 was also Zhang's trickery, taking advantage of her weakness. She also repeated the old story of the tavern sending the banquet and the car companies sending the cars to her house in the past. Finally, she claimed that since the coffin incident occurred, the plaintiff had suffered the consequences, became ill for no reason, suffered bad luck, and suffered losses in spirit, material, and credit. The defendant had committed the crime of Articles 330 and 383 of the Criminal Law and requested punishment according to the law. However, Zhang Shuliang not only denied sending the coffin, but also denied the car accident, saying that he could not afford a car and did not like to drive a car. The dancer's statement was either a mistaken identity or a deliberate fabrication. The case will be publicly tried by the First Special Court this afternoon. The truth will be revealed once the trial begins.</p>
<h3>Wang Xiaomei's Accusations</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Miss Wang told someone that Zhang Shuliang and Zhou and others had a feud with Xiaomei over dancing. First, at midnight on the 21st of last month, Yu was riding in his own car and driving around Yu Garden Road, when he happened to encounter Zhou's car. Seeing that Yu was weak and could be bullied, he crashed the car on purpose. In order to avoid trouble, Yu did not pursue the matter. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 27th of last month, Zhang and others dared to use Yu's name to order a child's coffin from the Xu Changxing Coffin Shop on Avenue Haig in the French Concession and ordered it to be sent to Yu's house. The shop assistant who delivered the coffin was taken to the police station, and the shop assistant provided the appearance of the person who bought the coffin. Afterwards, Yu took the shop assistant to the Shanghai Ballroom to identify him, and Zhang Shuliang was the person who ordered the coffin at that time. The ballroom sent someone to report to the British Police Station, but because the defendant's crime was in the French Concession, it was not accepted. Now it is found that Zhang Shuliang lives at No. 192 Xujia Garden, Tangjia Lane, Public Concession, so the lawsuit was filed with the jurisdictional government of the First Special District Court. They not only sent a child's coffin as a prank, but also repeatedly played similar pranks, such as suddenly having several tables of banquets from the Jue Lin Vegetable Restaurant brought to their homes, and suddenly having more than a dozen business cars and moving cars opened to Yu's home, and dozens of cases of Shunfeng brand fresh orange water sent to Yu's house, all ordered by telephone. After this, Yu was frightened, fell ill, and was unable to get out of bed. After being treated by a Western doctor, he recovered slightly, but he suffered great losses in spirit, material, reputation, and credit. The lawyer Wu has filed a lawsuit under Article 330 of the Criminal Law and Article 383 of the same law, etc., requesting that he be punished for the crime he deserves, and also an incidental civil lawsuit, etc.</p>
<p>Binlang Brand Cigarettes</p>
<h3>Dispute over the Prize Redemption Coupon for First Prize</h3>
<p>Three Coupons with the Same Prize Number Were Discovered</p>
<p>The Real Coupon Was Won by Chinese Constable Zhu Wenjiang</p>
<p>Li Dongtao, Who Had a Coupon but No Prize, Filed a Lawsuit</p>
<p>The 20-pack hard-shell Binlang brand cigarettes produced by China Huadong Tobacco Company previously issued a prize redemption coupon to reward customers. There were two groups, totaling one million numbers. The exchange method was that for every five empty packs collected, one prize redemption coupon could be exchanged at the designated cigarette paper shops. The prizes were divided into five types: one first prize of 5,000 yuan in foreign currency, two second prizes of 500 yuan in foreign currency each, four third prizes of 100 yuan in foreign currency each, ten fourth prizes of 15 yuan in foreign currency each, and fifty fifth prizes of 10 yuan in foreign currency each. The date of the prize drawing and the winning numbers were based on the first phase of the Aviation Highway Construction Prize Redemption Coupon drawn by the National Government on July 31, 1933. When the first prize number drawn at the expiration date was 226622, it was</p>
<h3>Zhu Wenjiang</h3>
<p>a Chinese constable number 3173 from the general patrol station, who won the prize. Zhu held the prize redemption coupon on August 5, affixed his personal seal on the back of the coupon, and received a prize of 5,000 yuan in foreign currency from the Central Trust Company on Beijing Road. This matter was also recorded in the newspapers of this port. Unexpectedly,</p>
<h3>Li Dongtao</h3>
<p>an employee of the Ruiji Company at No. 300 Yingchunfang, Hubei Road, also drew a Binlang brand prize redemption coupon number 226622 and held it to Huadong Tobacco Company to collect the prize. The company refused because the prize had already been collected by Chinese constable Zhu Wenjiang, who held the coupon. How could the same prize redemption coupon number be found again? Li then hired lawyer Yao Junyu to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Court, accusing Li Xuetong, the Cantonese manager of Huadong Tobacco Company, of fraud, and filed a private lawsuit for 5,000 yuan in foreign currency. The court approved the complaint and ordered a summons. Yesterday afternoon, Magistrate Huang Risheng took the seat in the Fifth Tribunal for questioning. The defendant hired lawyers Wu Linkun and Chen Zhongyin to appear in court to defend. The plaintiff Li Dongtao did not appear and his agent lawyer stated the case in court. The original Binlang brand prize redemption coupon number 226622 was presented as evidence. Then the defendant's agents, lawyers Wu and Chen, stated that the Huadong Tobacco Company issued a total of 1 million Binlang brand prize redemption coupons, printed by Daxing Printing Factory, and entrusted Xielong Tobacco Company as the general agent to distribute the ordered coupons and stubs to the designated cigarette paper shops for exchange. After the prize drawing, the first prize coupon had already been collected by Chinese constable Zhu Wenjiang. Later, the same first prize coupon was suddenly discovered several times. The company did not know about this at first. After receiving</p>
<h3>Chen Qun's</h3>
<p>letter, stating that he had drawn a blank prize redemption coupon paper, with no number on it, and attaching a photo. Lawyer Tang Youwei also sent a letter stating that he also had a prize redemption coupon number 226622, requesting to collect the payment. Huadong Company then began an investigation and collected all the stub books of the issued coupons and checked the numbers. It was found that about 20 prize redemption coupons and stubs had the numbers omitted. This was probably because the printing factory was too busy and accidentally omitted the numbers when printing so many tickets, resulting in 20 tickets being issued without numbers. After the prize drawing, profiteers who held blank coupons privately printed the first prize number on them, hoping to fraudulently collect the prize from the company. The constable who claimed the prize today and the Daxing Printing Factory, Xielong Tobacco Company, and Dashun Cigarette Paper Shop have all arrived in court and can provide evidence. Moreover, the prize redemption coupon presented by the plaintiff today, number 226622, is different from the number issued by Huadong. Witness Zhu Wenjiang testified that he was from Tianjin and served as a Chinese constable No. 317 at the General Patrol Station. I exchanged this prize redemption coupon at Dashun Cigarette Paper Shop at the intersection of Sichuan Road and Ningbo Road. The number was 226622. I affixed my seal on the morning of August 5 and received 5,000 yuan in foreign currency from the Central Trust Company on Beijing Road. The factory director of Daxing Printing Factory</p>
<h3>Jiang Hancheng</h3>
<p>testified that the prize redemption coupons of Huadong Tobacco Company were printed by our factory, and a contract was signed. After the coupons were printed, the numbers were printed. At that time, because the ink on the prize redemption coupons was not dry, some of them stuck together, resulting in the numbers being omitted. We did not pay attention to it at the time. The court then asked Jiang to examine the prize redemption coupon presented by the plaintiff. After Jiang read it carefully, he replied that the ticket was indeed genuine, but the color and stroke thickness of the number did not match. The court believed that the facts of the case were quite clear, and ordered the start of the debate. Then the lawyers of both parties, Yao Junyu, Wu Linkun, and Chen Zhongyin, stood up and debated for a long time. Magistrate Huang declared the debate over and scheduled the verdict for the 20th of this month in the Shen Mengyi case.</p>
<h3>Two Kidnappers Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>Other Accomplices Also Severely Punished</p>
<p>Shen Mengyi, an employee of the foreign exchange department of the Bank of China and the son of Shen Tianxin, a wealthy businessman from Huzhou residing in Shanghai, was kidnapped on June 20th in front of the customs library on Xin Zha Road. A large ransom was demanded. Subsequently, Yu A'gen, the Chinese chief detective of the Old Zhabei Police Station, along with detectives Liu Junqing, Zhou Guilin, and informant Shen Jinwen, rescued Shen from No. 559 Route Lafayette and apprehended the kidnappers, including Ma Rongsheng, totaling fourteen individuals. After interrogation by the First Special Court, it was discovered that Gao had previously committed the kidnapping of He Jiachun, a major grain merchant, for ransom, as well as armed robbery of jewelry from the prostitute Hong Juhua. The interrogation having concluded, yesterday morning, presided over by Feng Shide, the presiding judge of the criminal court, the First Criminal Tribunal announced the verdict: Ma Qiaosheng and Gao Changsheng were each sentenced to death; Wen Youtang, Wu Decheng, and Tao Xiaozhang were each sentenced to life imprisonment; Du Yongliang was sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment; Mao Zifeng was sentenced to thirteen years of imprisonment; Chen Wangshi was sentenced to three years of imprisonment; Zhou Yinglong was sentenced to one year of imprisonment; and Jiang Zhiping was sentenced to three months of imprisonment. Except for the death and life sentences, the remaining defendants' pre-trial detention days would be credited, with two days offsetting one day of imprisonment. Three pistols and sixteen bullets were confiscated. The equipment inside No. 559 Route Lafayette was permitted to be sold by the police station and turned over to the court. Ma Rongsheng, Shu Renchang, and Gu Juhua (female) were all found not guilty. The police station's lawyer, Ru,</p>
<p>Bao Yi declared that he would waive the right to appeal regarding the not-guilty verdicts. Shu Renchang's lawyer, Fan Gang, requested his immediate release, which the court granted.</p>
<h3>Police Officer Suddenly Missing</h3>
<p>Doesn't Seem Like He Deserted... Some Say He's Dead</p>
<p>Zhao Minggao, a guard employed by the British-American Tobacco Company in Lujiazui, Pudong, was on duty at post No. 25 along the riverbank from 9 PM to 12 AM the night before last. Around 10 PM, Sergeant Jiang Maogui inspected the post and saw him standing guard, fulfilling his duties. Unexpectedly, when another officer, Zhu Jiafan, went to relieve him at midnight, he could not find any trace of the officer. Zhu assumed he might have returned to the police station. However, by 5 AM yesterday morning, he was still nowhere to be found. Sergeant Jiang reported this to District Officer Wang Yongmao, who went to Zhao's residence to investigate (the officer's family lived near Tobacco Factory Road). According to his wife, her husband had not returned home. District Officer Wang became increasingly alarmed and sent police officers to investigate along the riverbank where he was stationed, but there were no signs. The reason for his disappearance remains a mystery. It is believed that he may have been murdered by bandits or committed suicide by jumping into the Huangpu River, which seems plausible. However, there is no evidence to suggest that he deserted, as none of his clothes or luggage at home had been touched, ruling out that possibility. Therefore, the theory that the officer is no longer alive seems increasingly credible. Yesterday afternoon, District Officer Wang reported the matter to the Third District, and District Chief Zhang relayed the information to the General Bureau, ordering a thorough investigation. The officer is 32 years old, from Hebei, and has been a police officer for five or six years.</p>
<h3>Robbery of 3,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Daylight Robbery on Guangdong Road</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 10:40 AM, a clerk from the Dingtai Southern Goods Store at No. 151 Guangdong Road in the Public Concession was instructed to carry banknotes totaling 3,000 yuan, along with a check for 300 yuan, in a hired car to the Bank of China on the Bund to deposit the funds. Shortly after departing, as the car turned north onto Guangdong Road, two thugs suddenly appeared and blocked the car. They pulled out pistols and ordered the clerk to remain silent. Seeing the aggressive approach, the clerk threw the bag of money onto the road. One thug fired a shot and guarded the clerk, while the other thug picked up the bag of money and fled north together. The clerk witnessed their escape and returned to the store to report the robbery. The store owner then reported the incident to the Fourth Road General Police Station, requesting that the robbers be apprehended and brought to justice.</p>

<p>Shanghai Bank</p>
<h3>Reduced Interest Rates on Fixed Deposits</h3>
<p>Yet Deposits Greatly Increased</p>
<p>The major banks in Shanghai offer relatively favorable interest rates on ten-year fixed deposits, at least one percent. Due to its prosperous business over the years, the Shanghai Bank on Ningbo Road has an even larger amount of fixed deposits. The bank initially planned to temporarily stop accepting new deposits. However, due to the demands of many customers, it continued to accept them, but in order to slightly restrict the volume, it recently stipulated that the annual interest rate would only be eight percent. However, in the past one or two months, fixed deposits from customers have not decreased at all, but have greatly increased. The interest rate is not a major concern. This demonstrates the bank's outstanding credit and the depositors' faith in the bank.</p>

<h3>A Masterpiece from the Chinese Economic Society</h3>
<p>Publication of Sino-Japanese Trade Statistics</p>
<p>Cai Zhengya, director of the Sino-Japanese Trade Research Institute of the Chinese Economic Society, told visitors yesterday that for the past year, he has been very busy with tasks such as investigating substitutes for national products and compiling Sino-Japanese trade statistics, with the compilation of Sino-Japanese trade statistics being the most burdensome. The materials used were extracted from Chinese customs documents and statistics published by the Japanese Ministry of Finance. The analysis of charts and tables was very detailed. The content includes statistics on China's trade with Japan, foreign trade, and Japan's trade with China over the past 60 years, classification of import and export goods, analysis of China's import and export goods with Japan, the impact of previous boycotts on trade between the two countries, and the Liaoning Incident and Sino-Japanese trade. The entire book contains 348 pages, with 30 figures, 32 tables, and 9 appendices. The book was published by the China Book Company and was released last month. According to reports, Chinese customs documents are voluminous and extremely difficult to organize. Regarding the organization of statistics on China's international trade, there was the work of Yang Duanliu of the Academia Sinica on the statistical data of China's international trade for 65 years. However, the organization of statistical data on trade between China and Japan is credited to the Sino-Japanese Trade Research Institute.</p>

<h3>Important News</h3>
<p>All Schools Nationwide Should</p>
<p>Emphasize Border Issues</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 16th dispatch) In order to ensure that the people of the country fully understand border issues, the General Staff Headquarters has made the following recommendations to the Ministry of Education: 1. Compile reference books on the history, geography, politics, and religions of various ethnic groups in the border regions and include them as required courses. 2. Establish specialized departments for border languages in universities across the country, and graduates who pass the examination will be assigned by the government to serve in various border provinces. 3. Universities should organize border survey teams, with travel expenses subsidized by the government. 4. Establish special incentive measures for writings on border issues. 5. Compile textbooks in both Mongolian and Han Chinese, and Mongolian and Hui Chinese, for application in border schools. The Ministry of Education has expressed its agreement with these recommendations.</p>
<p>Ministry of Education Inspector Visits</p>
<h3>Opinions on Education in Henan Province</h3>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>In May of this year, the Ministry of Education dispatched inspectors Dai Xia and Zhou Bangdao to inspect education in Henan Province. They inspected 127 educational institutions, including 13 educational administrative bodies, 3 higher education institutions, 49 secondary education institutions, 43 primary education institutions, and 22 social education institutions. It is reported that the overall inspection report has been largely completed and will soon be submitted to the vice minister of the ministry. The following is a summary of their inspection opinions:</p>
<p>A. Educational Administration Aspect</p>
<p>(1) The organization of provincial and county educational administrative bodies is quite orderly, and the spirit is generally consistent. (2) Provincial and county educational funding is independent, which is commendable. However, the amount is still insufficient and should be increased. (3) In a few counties, educational undertakings often stagnate due to budget deficits or poor harvests in the off-season. The provincial department should make overall plans and set standards, and the county education bureau should consult with the county government based on local conditions to make adjustments. (4) The allocation of staff in the Education Department is appropriate, and most of them strive to fulfill their duties. However, given the vast area of the province, five provincial inspectors are insufficient and should be increased. The salaries of provincial inspectors should also be standardized and appropriately increased. (5) Too many staff in county education bureaus reside in the bureaus to handle affairs. Most county inspectors are alone, making widespread inspection difficult. The number of staff should be increased or decreased based on actual needs. County inspectors should also develop plans, conduct inspections on schedule, and provide practical guidance without favoritism. (6) Among county education bureau chiefs, some lack the ability to handle affairs effectively, and others find it difficult to exercise their powers due to improper command from administrative superiors. Strict investigations should be conducted, and appointments and removals should be handled properly. (7) The accounting in provincial middle and primary schools is handled by appointments from the Education Department, which is a good system. However, issues such as the training, transfer, and supervision of accounting personnel should be improved to achieve perfection. (8) Graduation examinations are held for all middle schools, normal schools, vocational schools, and primary schools throughout the province. Semester examinations are also held for first- and second-year students, selecting subjects. This has been done for three years with noticeable results. It is particularly unique to test students of the same grade in the entire province or county with the same questions at the same time. (9) The school building and equipment committee established by the Education Department has a designated amount of 200,000 yuan per year and is responsible for investigation, planning, undertaking, inspection, and guidance for the construction and equipment of provincial schools and other educational institutions. The system is very good. (10) Public primary schools and schools above the high school level are stipulated not to charge tuition fees. Students attending national and provincial universities receive student loans, and students attending secondary schools receive scholarships, which greatly benefit the advancement of poor students. In addition, the measures for rewarding Henan researchers at home and abroad and for rewarding Henan citizens for academic works are also very appropriate. (11) Each county has an educational administrative committee, which is well-intentioned. However, the work is somewhat lax and should be strictly supervised to achieve practical results. (12) County and district education committee members bear significant responsibility. Their powers and treatment should be appropriately increased, and personnel with educational knowledge and experience should be carefully selected to fill these positions. (13) Production in the province is backward, and there are many unemployed people. Vocational schools at all levels should be established as much as possible, and vocational supplementary education should be promoted using existing equipment. Specialized schools above the junior college level with an industrial nature should also be established as appropriate. Academic organizations that research and improve industries should also be promoted, organized, and rewarded. (14) The distribution of provincial middle schools and normal schools throughout the province is not balanced. Adjustments should be made in the future. (15) Middle school teachers are generally paid by the hour without a dedicated system, resulting in unrestricted part-time teaching and multiple jobs, which causes many drawbacks. Standards for service and treatment of middle school teachers should be established quickly, and the number of part-time positions should be limited in accordance with middle school regulations. (16) Vocational schools should, except in special circumstances where several departments may be established, follow the principle of establishing single departments in accordance with the Vocational School Law. (17) The names, organization, curriculum, graduation years, and qualifications of teachers in county-run middle schools, normal schools, and vocational schools are largely inconsistent with current regulations and should be reorganized and improved urgently. (18) Qualified primary school teachers are still lacking. Provincial normal schools should find ways to expand class sizes and increase the number of rural normal schools as much as possible. (19) Some counties have hundreds of county-run primary schools, making management and supervision inconvenient. County funds should be prioritized for fully established primary schools, and district funds, township and village funds, etc., should be used as much as possible for junior primary schools. If there is a surplus in county funds, a portion can be allocated as subsidies for primary schools other than county-run schools. (20) There are too few rural primary schools in each county, making it difficult to popularize compulsory education. More rural primary schools should be established, and short-term primary schools should be quickly and extensively established to provide relief. (21) Many private middle schools are poorly managed and should be strictly examined and resolutely banned. (22) Rural primary schools and social education institutions in each county are mostly poorly managed. County Education Bureau chiefs should be instructed to strictly rectify them. (23) There are many private schools in various places. The "Implementation Measures for the Management of Private Schools in Jiangsu Province" should be referenced to effectively supervise improvements without resorting to passive bans. (24) Primary school teachers should be hired from normal school graduates as much as possible. The qualifications of non-examined and certified teachers should be strictly enforced in accordance with primary school regulations. (25) Many teachers and staff in provincial schools still advance or retreat with the principal, assigning positions based on factionalism regardless of academic merit or talent, which greatly hinders educational effectiveness. This bad habit should be thoroughly eradicated again. (26) The equipment expenses of provincial middle and primary schools should be re-determined with reference to middle and primary school regulations, appropriately increased, and equipment standards should be established. The equipment section of the school building and equipment committee or another school science equipment committee should be established to oversee all equipment matters in a more economical and convenient manner. (27) In areas with a large number of schools but simple equipment, public science museums should be organized to purchase and concentrate valuable instruments and specimens so that students from various schools in the area can observe and experiment together. (28) County-run, district-run, and township-run primary schools in each county have an excessive number of schools and use ordinal numbers for school names, which is inconvenient. School names should be based on the local place names in accordance with primary school regulations. (29) The salaries of rural primary school teachers are too low. The Education Department should issue an order to its subordinates to appropriately increase salaries to enhance educational effectiveness. (30) The Committee for Experimental Education in Kaifeng gathers educational experts and works diligently on planning and implementation. However, the primary schools, community schools, and other community education institutions under its jurisdiction have not yet shown significant results in experimental education. Efforts should be made to promote this further to achieve good results. (31) The amount of graduation visit subsidies received by students of normal and vocational schools in their hometowns should be limited to avoid hindering county education. Those who have received fees but have not gone out to visit should be pursued to save public funds. (32) The Education Department publishes the "Henan Education Monthly" and the "Henan Education Daily," which are exceptionally well-informed about educational news throughout the province. They also greatly assist in the promotion of government policies. However, the daily newspaper should reduce ordinary news as much as possible and increase educational news to truly match its name.</p>
<h3>Certificates Issued for Higher and General Examinations in Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>The higher and general examinations for certification in Jiangsu Province have been completed, and the names of all those who passed the entire examination and those who passed specific subjects have been posted. It is reported that the Jiangsu Provincial Examination Committee has set the period from August 19th to August 29th as the period for issuing certificates and proofs. All those who passed must personally go to the committee to receive them within the prescribed time limit. However, for the convenience of all members, they may also entrust reliable relatives and friends in the provincial capital to collect them on their behalf, and they may also send a letter to request the committee to send them directly, but they must attach stamp tax fees and return registered postage to avoid errors.</p>
<h3>Opening of the Guangdong Provincial Education Exhibition</h3>
<p>(Guangzhou, 16th Dispatch) The Education Exhibition initiated by the Provincial Education Department opened today at the National College of Law and Politics. The exhibits are divided into twelve categories, and there are music, singing, and martial arts performances.

<h3>Admissions at Various Schools</h3>
<p>Modified Measures for Northeastern Students</p>
<p>Notification from the Municipal Education Bureau</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau issued an order yesterday to middle schools and higher institutions in the city: "We have received Instruction No. 7805 from the Ministry of Education, which states: 'We have approved the official letter No. 3218 from the Secretariat of the Central Executive Committee, forwarding the telegram from the Northeast Party Affairs Office requesting remedies for the enrollment of Northeastern students. The original telegram was intended to allow students from outside Shanhaiguan to study inside Shanhaiguan, so appropriate modifications should be made. It has now been stipulated that when schools enroll students, Northeastern students holding graduation certificates issued before the September 18th Incident in 1931 (those who have not had time to exchange for formal graduation certificates) and those who have not taken graduation examinations should be temporarily allowed to enroll this year. Those holding graduation certificates issued in the name of pseudo-organizations should first be given separate examinations in subjects such as Chinese, Party Principles, History, and Geography. If they pass, they should then be allowed to participate in the entrance examination. In addition to distributing this to other departments, we are issuing this order to instruct the schools under your jurisdiction to comply accordingly.'"</p>

<p>Municipal Education Bureau</p>
<h3>Ban on China Industrial Primary School</h3>
<p>The private China Industrial First Primary School, located in Zishouli, Xiqiujiang Road, Zhabei, was founded by Cao Youguang. Its performance has been poor, so the Municipal Education Bureau has classified it as a school to be improved. Recently, someone filed a complaint with the Education Bureau, stating that the school falsely claimed to be registered, had an improper organization, was corrupt in content, and that the principal, Cao Youguang, was using the school to collect money. It is reported that the bureau has sent personnel to investigate and found that most of the allegations are true. The bureau has sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau to strictly ban the school as a warning to others.</p>
<p>Cinema Education Association</p>
<h3>Actively Preparing to Screen Educational Films</h3>
<p>Dispatching Staff to Contact Various Schools</p>
<p>University Federation Willing to Provide Strong Assistance</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai Branch of the China Education Film Association has been striving to realize its plan to screen educational films, and it is scheduled to start screening in various schools in the city from the next semester. Staff have been dispatched to contact various schools. The association had previously sent a letter to the University Federation requesting strong assistance in screening educational films at various universities. It is reported that the University Federation has replied in a letter stating: "We have received your letter regarding the proposal to screen educational films at various universities and requesting assistance. This matter has been submitted to the 15th Standing Committee meeting of the association for discussion. It was unanimously agreed that this is an important way to promote the physical and mental cultivation of young people, and the association will wholeheartedly cooperate and assist in its implementation. However, whether this educational film can achieve widespread practical results depends on whether its content meets the interests and psychology of the students. It is proposed that your association first hold a test screening at the opening ceremony or welcome freshmen's gathering at various universities, and then determine the direction of promotion based on the students' impressions. In addition to this association issuing a notice to the student unions of each university to investigate the date of the opening ceremony and declaring cooperation with your association to the school authorities, we are sending this letter in reply. Please check. As for the subsidy funds, please send someone to discuss the details with Mr. Xue Guangqian, the representative of Soochow University at our association."</p>

<h3>Recent Developments in Enrollment at National Tongji University</h3>
<p>Special German Language Remedial Class for Higher Surveying Department</p>
<p>Increased Enrollment in Senior Vocational School Civil Engineering Department</p>
<p>The College of Engineering of Tongji University has established a Department of Higher Surveying. The educational cooperation measures previously agreed upon with the Land Survey Bureau of the General Staff Headquarters have been slightly modified. It has been decided that in this academic year, a special German language remedial class will be established, with a quota of 20 students. They will study German at the school for one year and then go to the Nanjing Survey Bureau for an internship while continuing to study German in order to be able to listen to lectures directly. After one year, they will return to the school, where German surveying experts will teach advanced surveying knowledge and technology. After three years, they will return to the Survey Bureau for another six-month internship before returning to the school for various research and organization work. After one year, they will graduate and be employed entirely by the Survey Bureau. According to this plan, the department will only require six years of study, and it will be the first class to cultivate high-level surveying talents for our country. The Survey Bureau will plan their future career paths in advance, which is a shortcut to success. After receiving a portion of the former Laodai University's property, the school added a senior vocational school. Originally, only one class was planned for the mechanical engineering department. After consultation with the Ministry of Education regarding the establishment of departments, a civil engineering department was added, with a quota of 50 students, specializing in architecture, bridge, river, and maritime engineering to prepare for the country's construction needs. The school is the first national vocational school, and the Ministry of Education attaches great importance to it. Most of the faculty members are industrial experts who have studied in Germany, and their excellent results can be predicted.</p>
<h3>Material Improvements at Chih Tze College</h3>
<p>After the school buildings of Chih Tze College, located on Shuidian Road, Zhabei, were bombed by Japanese soldiers during the January 28th Incident, efforts were made to repair them, and they were restored to their original state long ago. Last semester, a large sports field was built, and the project has been completely completed. There are many running tracks, soccer fields, basketball courts, tennis courts, and volleyball courts, which are sufficient for the sports needs of a large number of male and female students. The school has an electric generator and a well, and all the electricity and drinking water are supplied by itself. However, the lights sometimes break down and flicker. From next semester onwards, the school's water and electricity will be connected to the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company. If the school's own generator fails, the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company can immediately supply electricity. All classrooms, student dormitories, and offices in the school are equipped with heating pipes, making them extremely comfortable even in the cold winter. It is also reported that the school has newly hired professors, including Shao Xunbei, former professor at Chaoyang University; Cao Jie, Bachelor of Law from Peking University and former judge of the Shandong Higher Court; Huang Qingzhong, former professor at the Zhejiang Provincial School of Law and Politics; Li Zuqi, Bachelor of Commerce from the school and Master of Commerce from the University of California, USA; Yao Bolong, Master of Politics from Columbia University, USA; and Cai Wenxi, Master of Commerce from the University of Wisconsin, USA.

Ms. Shao graduated from Liangjiang and is one of the few female athletes in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>New Developments at YMCA Middle School</h3>
<p>Since hiring educational experts to improve the curriculum and adopting scientific teaching methods at the YMCA Middle School in this city two years ago, the facilities have become increasingly complete, and the number of students has also increased sharply. Last year, the Chinese Education Department of the Public Concession provided a large subsidy, which was used to expand the biology, physics, and chemistry laboratories, workshops, and libraries. Since the summer vacation, the teaching staff has held many meetings and decided that from the next semester onwards, in addition to English, a second foreign language will be added, and several Chinese and Western female teachers will be hired to specialize in teaching each subject to ensure accurate pronunciation and pleasant intonation. In the field of natural sciences, several experts have been newly hired, who will not only raise the level of instruction but also focus on experiments and practice to correct the previous habit of only lecturing on theory and having a superficial understanding. Extracurricular activities are designed to make students view the school as a family and society and to enhance their ability to handle affairs in their future careers. The school has conducted repeated research and experimentation over the past two years. The existing newspaper society, business art society, calligraphy and painting society, literary society, and music society have achieved satisfactory results. Starting this semester, experts will be hired to guide them, and new organizations such as sports clubs and drama groups will be established. It is also reported that the school's night school will be renamed a vocational night school. The proposed subjects include practical Chinese, commercial English, practical commerce, and practical accounting. The graduation years and tuition fees have been properly stipulated to break the previous record of 1,500 students.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Grants Special Permission to Establish Zhaohe Middle School</h3>
<p>Zhaohe Middle School, located at 467 Haig Road, has been praised by society since its establishment for its pure purpose and the responsible efforts of its school board members. However, one matter is still of concern, namely the school's registration. Whether a school is registered or not is not only related to the school's address but also affects the future of the students. Therefore, the school authorities, even in the midst of the busy establishment period, initially followed the educational laws and regulations and paid attention to them repeatedly. Because the Ministry of Education has issued a notice restricting the establishment of ordinary middle schools in the city, and because the school has a slightly different nature as a memorial to revolutionary martyrs, a special solution must be sought outside the regulations. Therefore, when the school applied to the education authorities for approval of its establishment a month ago, Director Pan forwarded the application to the Ministry of Education, and school board members Sun Ke and Wu Zhihui explained the reasons for requesting permission to establish the school to Minister of Education Wang Shijie, who ordered the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau to grant special permission for its establishment and immediately replied to Sun and Wu. The original letter from President Sun to Yang Hucheng is excerpted below: "Brother Xiaotian, I have just received a reply from Minister Wang Xuejie (Wang Shijie), stating that Zhaohe Middle School is established to commemorate the martyrs, and the situation is special. All matters related to the application for establishment by the school board members will be handled in accordance with the instructions, and the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau has been instructed to comply. In the future, I hope you will inform the responsible members of the school to work hard and strive for great results. Please take note of this and pray for your safety. Sun Ke respectfully."</p>
<h3>Pudong Middle School Adds Second Attached Primary School</h3>
<p>Since Dr. Xu Quzhi became the president of Pudong Middle School in this city this semester, he has been striving to expand the school. Recognizing the large population in Pudong and the scarcity of primary schools, and in order to popularize education and provide relief to rural children who are out of school, he consulted with the school's directors, Zhang Shuqin, Wang Keming, and Gao Naitong, and proposed to add a second attached primary school in Pudong. It was unanimously agreed, and the matter was brought up for discussion at yesterday's school administrative meeting. Xu Zelin, the school's director of student affairs, has been engaged in education for many years and has extensive experience. It was unanimously decided to elect Xu as the principal of the attached primary school and to start enrollment immediately. It is reported that there is a school building nearby with a spacious playground, and all the equipment is already available. Enrollment is expected to be enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>Dongya Boy Scout Training Class Returns to Shanghai from Mount Lu</h3>
<p>The Boy Scout training class of Dongya Physical Education College in this city traveled a long distance to hold a summer camp in Mount Lu, Jiangxi, which was greatly praised by the national government and local dignitaries. The news was reported in this newspaper. It is reported that the group stayed in Mount Lu for a total of six days. Every morning, they practiced various outdoor courses, and in the afternoon, they enjoyed the famous scenic spots. On the evening of the 11th, they held a campfire party to entertain local residents, and about a thousand Chinese and foreign people attended, which was an unprecedented event in the area. Mr. Jashi, the first Boy Scout trained by the founder of the World Boy Scout Movement, Baden-Powell, also participated in the guest speech, which was particularly commendable. On the morning of the 12th, the group broke camp and descended the mountain, and Chinese and foreign people from nearby bade farewell along the way, showing great reluctance. It is reported that the group of eighty people arrived safely in Shanghai yesterday morning on the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangshun ship. They will hold a graduation examination starting today, and the graduation swearing-in ceremony will be held on the 19th. Letters have been sent to the Boy Scout Council and various Party and government agencies inviting them to attend and guide the ceremony.</p>

<p>U-You Cup Tennis</p>
<h3>Zheng Zhaojia Triumphs Over Liang Deguang</h3>
<p>Result: Two to One</p>
<p>The Youyou Cup Tennis Tournament featured the most exciting match yesterday between Zheng Zhaojia and Liang Deguang. Liang Deguang had just returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong. In yesterday's match, Mr. Liang showed significant improvement compared to the past. In the first set, he used sharp-angled, fast serves to prevent Zheng Zhaojia from retaliating, winning 6-4. In the second set, Mr. Zheng rallied, leading 4-2, but Mr. Liang caught up, making it 5-5. However, Liang's strength waned, and Zheng won 7-5. In the third set, the two sides were evenly matched, but Liang ultimately lost to Zheng due to fatigue, with Zheng winning 6-4. The quality of the rallies between the two was rare in this tournament. Sun Linfang's victory over Tang Yongchun was also hard-earned. Chen Chuanzhang's win over Zhuo Guanpei, known as "gumdrop," was closely contested, and Chen found it difficult to win. The results from yesterday are as follows:</p>
<p>Zheng Zhaojia defeated Liang Deguang 4-6, 7-5, 6-4</p>
<p>Sun Linfang defeated Tang Yongchun 6-1, 6-2, 7-9</p>

<h3>World Tennis Championships Diary (I)</h3>
<p>Special Dispatch from London by Yizhi</p>
<p>The 53rd Wimbledon Championships of the All England Lawn Tennis Club was unprecedented, with spectacular matches, beautiful weather, and increasingly large crowds. The management was also impeccable. In two of the events, the veterans retained their titles: Mrs. Moody, champion of the women's singles, and Borrow Clough and Browning, champions of the men's doubles. The other three events produced new champions. Australian Crawford, in addition to winning the Australian and French singles championships, now added the Wimbledon championship. American Miss Landis and French Madame Mathieu won the women's doubles title together, and Germany also made its first entry into the championship list, with Madame Kravin and Kramm winning the mixed doubles championship without losing a single set. In terms of nationality, Australia, America, France, and Germany each won one title, and the United States and France combined to win another. This great new champion, Crawford, is British, and another British player, Miss Rounde, fought hard with Mrs. Moody for the title, only narrowly failing.</p>
<p>The championships were held at the All England Club grounds in Wimbledon, near London, from Monday, June 26 to Saturday, July 8. Many surprising events occurred during the competition. Some inspiring individuals and doubles teams were defeated in the early days. Mrs. Moody's retention of the championship was expected. As for Vines, the old champion was thought to be superior to Crawford before the event, but Crawford nearly suffered defeat on the first day. In the past three years, the American failures have been more prominent than their successes. Their doubles champions, Vines and Gran Hill, lost to the Australian Thon Bill and Quest Off. The third-ranked and sixth-ranked American players, Seed and Steven, both failed to perform to their usual standards. Seed even lost to Hughes in straight sets. The first-ranked British player, Pan Yeh, was defeated by the South African Fagua Sheng on the second day. Austin lost to the Japanese Sato in five sets and thus failed to reach the quarter-finals. The participants in this year's competition were the stars from all sides, making it a truly grand event.</p>
<h3>June 28 (Wednesday)</h3>
<p>Today, the third day of the tournament, unexpected things happened, and not just minor changes. Vines and Gran Hill were defeated by the two Australians, Thon Bill and Quest Off, on the center court. Their failure was indescribable. After the American team won the first two sets, there was a glimmer of hope at the end of the fourth set, but they collapsed and never recovered. The situation was very good for the two in the Queen's Club competition on Friday, but the failure in Lawson Pudon on Sunday was unbelievable. It was difficult for the two to say to each other. In the battle with Tunqiu, they struggled to win the first two sets with 6-4 and 7-5, the Australian team won the third set and took the lead in the fourth set, and Quis Te's serve was broken by the US team, making it 4 each. The game was disappointing, and the four had inexcusable mistakes. Gran Hill was the worst. Thon Billquist was the best. Vines once had zero or forty in the serve, and won the victory. After four each, Ge's serve was fifteen or forty, and it became equal, and then occupied the first note, but suddenly he could not cheer up and was obtained by the Australian team, and won the next round, and got the fourth set, and became each two. During this period, Vines had no excitement.</p>
<p>At the same time, in the first game, there was nothing to praise about Sedstein's game against Lin and Bai Nat of France. On the center court, applause rang out, and the Australian players were greatly applauded by the British people and won the victory, which was the inevitable result.</p>
<p>From the conversation, it is known that Fan Sisi is getting worse every time today, and will drag Gran Hill and will not recover. Ge's serve was broken first, and Fan followed, and the two had nothing to do. There has never been a first-class doubles player who hits the ball so badly. This is neither unintentional nor inattentive, nor does it despise the enemy, but in fact cannot perform better skills. In the last four sets, Gran Hill was the worst, and Fan could still take the front line, and he was better than Ge.</p>
<p>Thon Bill was the hero of the day, and the ball was powerful and beautiful, and Stowe switched to help. Quis only made a few mistakes in the fourth set, otherwise the two Australians would win in straight sets. The overall situation was attacking everywhere, going forward to intercept and kill, while the two American beauties retreated everywhere, their steps were chaotic, and they were incomparably weak.</p>
<p>In a completely different situation, the British He Shi won the victory over the Australian McGrath and was very popular. Li caught the enemy in the first set, and then went straight forward, and could not find the imperial resistance, and hit the dead spot with a forehand. Four-fifths of the ball went deep into the two wings, making the other party exhausted. Only the backhand was weaker. The accuracy of his footsteps and direction without changing was the most striking thing about Li. His terrible offensive, from the bottom line to half the field, showed his full blood, and Li often made the ball not enter Mai's backhand, which was a clear tactic.</p>
<p>For the young McGrath, from beginning to end, the heart and the wish were against each other, not without fading even Li's draw, Mai did not dare to try to hit high balls or go online, but frankly speaking, Mai's ball was not bad, even in the end of the game when he was about to fail and lose courage, Mai was still struggling, Hughes also made the British dance and defeated the Japanese Aoki, losing only three games in total. Except for many chopping balls, the hitting method is no different from Li, exquisite, powerful, and nowhere is not good. Sato won Rassed, but it was not moving, slow, uninteresting, and the backhand was much weaker than usual. Rassed was a special giant, and Stanley, New Zealand, and South Africa Korton fought hard for five sets, and Shi Fang won. Shi was steady and unyielding, and Korton won one or four or two sets, but it was obvious that he was not a winning player. The American Boer and Ke Xian fought to the fifth set, and they were proud to take the lead with a score of 1 to 0. After confidently defeating Boer without effort, he fought with Ke Xian, and Boer won the first set, and Ke Xian only won two games. Boer's progress was rapid and gratifying, and he was able to use various hitting methods, but he lacked consideration. Ke won the second and third sets, and the fourth set was about to win, but Boer won with seven to five. Boer won a total of three games in the fifth set. Ke Xian was far inferior to usual, and most of them went online. Ireland Lowe defeated Germany Rent, and the fifth set was seven to five. South Africa Lau Pins lost to the American Jones. This game was a decisive battle between fierce serve and attack and steady defense.</p>
<p>Female players have added a lot of scenery to the players, all of them are beautifully dressed, and Mrs. Goflie won a set from Miss Scriven. The mixed doubles started, and Mrs. Madi and Ti were victorious.</p>
<p>Cede Stowe vs. Bai Natte Merlin, the American team won the first set and lost the second one, and saved the third set in extreme danger. The French broke the opponent's serve, and Merlin got the number of forty or zero. Merlin stood in front of the net, and only needed to kill without effort to win, but Merlin sent it into the net, so that the beauty got this game, and won the second time, making the number of sets one to one, and the French were shaken, and the beauty felt more confident, and won the fourth set with six to four. Stowe was the weakest person, and Merlin could be taken, with a little mistake, Bai Nat was calm, Cede was the most thoughtful person to score, and he was getting better and better, and Stowe followed him and improved. Although the audience in the first game was satisfied with the competition, there were too many mistakes, which inevitably reduced the color.</p>

<h3>Attractiveness and Purchasing Power</h3>
<p>— Yang Mang</p>
<p>The development of national goods primarily lies in promoting the market for national goods, and the first thing to consider in attracting the attention of general customers is attractiveness. Once the attention of customers has been attracted, it is also necessary to pay attention to whether they have the purchasing power and the level of that purchasing power. Please elaborate on these points:</p>
<p>(1) Attractiveness: The greatest weapon of attractiveness is newspaper advertising. There may be very fine and inexpensive goods, and there may be products produced in large quantities, but without the attractiveness of advertising, no one will patronize them, and no one will care about them. This is how uneconomical and how great a loss. Only the most intelligent managers can utilize advertising and know that the publication of advertisements has truly incredible effects. One unit of advertising expenditure can yield ten or twenty units of profit. It is a great mistake for general managers to regard advertising as a mere formality, a personal favor, or a waste of expenditure. I personally heard an experienced cosmetics store owner say: "The effectiveness of advertising is immediate. If more advertising is used on a certain day, the retail and wholesale business will suddenly increase by more than two times. If it is stopped for a few days, then the customers will decrease, and the trade volume will decline." This has been tested repeatedly, and there is no way to change it. It can be seen that attractiveness is extremely important to the national goods business and must be paid close attention to in order to increase the market for national goods in an invisible way. (2) Purchasing power: To maintain the promotion of national goods, it is necessary to manufacture fine goods that are inexpensive, of high quality, and durable. And it is even more necessary for the people to have the economic ability to purchase goods. Many expensive goods on the market are only enjoyed by the bourgeoisie and cannot be universally available to the general public. This is not because the general public does not like to use them, but because their economic ability cannot reach that level. The national goods manufactured by our country's manufacturers should, of course, be considered for the majority of people, in order to expand the scope of promotion. If the important issues of food, clothing, and shelter for the general public are still struggling in hardship, then they will have no ability to purchase other daily necessities. Purchasing power and the promotion of goods are interrelated, and they grow and decline together. Weak purchasing power makes promotion difficult, and strong purchasing power makes promotion easy. This is an easy principle to observe. Recently, our country's rural areas have gone bankrupt, and the economy has declined. The purchasing power of the people in the interior is declining year by year, which has greatly affected the promotion of national goods. Compared with last year, the turnover of each factory this year accounts for only five or six tenths on average. How dangerous is this phenomenon? Therefore, if China wants to see the development of national goods today, it all depends on the cultivation of purchasing power. The only way to cultivate purchasing power is to hope that the factories will adopt more domestic raw materials, and to find ways to improve and guide them so that the products are excellent and the cost is low, meeting the needs of the people in the interior. If the economic situation of the people in the interior is in a better state, then the promotion of national goods will be able to achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>National Goods Talk</p>
<h3>How to Transform Import Surplus into Export Surplus</h3>
<p>— Tian Xu Wo Sheng</p>
<p>The dumping of American cotton by foreign merchants is indeed causing resentment among Chinese yarn factories, but as far as the government is concerned, the need for funds is urgent, and this is also unavoidable. And it can be known that the wheat borrowed will also follow this old path. However, I believe that the fundamental solution lies not in taking back the orders, but in the fact that the people of our country all have the same likes and dislikes, which is enough to reverse the decline. Just look at the same day's report (Shen Bao, August 6, 1933): British Member of Parliament Astor Petri said: "The invasion of Japanese goods is more dangerous than war. Britain is about to suffer the calamity of this yellow peril. Even raising tariffs cannot prevent the invasion. We should urgently rise up and strive to drive it out." Although I do not know what methods the British are referring to when they say "urgently rise up and strive," but as far as our Chinese people are concerned, people's likes and dislikes are generally the same. A sense of shame is something that everyone has. Suppose that students and workers all over the country are spreading the word everywhere, advising rural areas to spin and weave their own cloth, competing to take pride in wearing native cloth and taking shame in wearing fine yarn foreign cloth. The uniforms of the military and police, whenever new ones are needed, should all be made of native cloth. Senior officials should abandon wool and use cotton silk instead, to set an example. When the superiors like something, the subordinates will certainly do even more. In social situations, when seeing someone wearing foreign goods, one should stand up and give a speech in public, advising people to use national goods. Instead of using expensive foreign cloth, it would be better to use inexpensive silk. Instead of using rayon fabrics, it would be better to use Pu silk and Tai silk. Moreover, the price of large silk is already lower than the price of rayon. I personally saw this at the Hangzhou Exhibition. The people of our country are nothing more than four categories: scholars, farmers, workers, and merchants. The clothing of these four categories of people originally all used national goods. Only the funeral clothes of the bereaved began to abandon silk and use hemp cloth. Those who liked luxury were ashamed to wear cloth clothes, so they used feather foreign satin to make them. People in society, although they did not criticize them, used a humorous sarcasm to call those who wore foreign goods filial clothing, the meaning of which was that there was no one to teach them, so they were unfilial descendants. Wealthy people must use silk to enshroud the corpse, while poor people use cloth to enshroud the corpse. There is never anyone who uses foreign goods. Therefore, the amount of silk consumed for weddings and funerals is truly great. Even vehicles, horses, tables, chairs, doors, windows, planks, walls, and lamps and mirrors must be covered with silk, and embroidered with cotton. This is precisely to absorb the surplus money of the scholar-officials in order to save the farmers, workers, and merchants. And all the ceremonial pomp is also set up to save the poor. For example, a beggar can get a few coins all day long, while a person who carries a sign and holds an office only needs to work for half a day to have enough for three meals. This kind of humorous doctrine is only that it has not been broken down. In fact, it is no less than a monetary circulation doctrine, precisely to supplement the lack of those who have excess. The current social policy is to blindly eliminate old habits, which is called superstition, and it must be overthrown with all force. However, it is not known that changing the soup without changing the medicine, not being superstitious about old habits, but being superstitious about Europeanization, on the contrary, using the full force of selling from abroad to overthrow our country's farmers, workers, and merchants, the intensity of the disaster is really worse than floods and wild beasts. If we do not urgently rise up and strive, our people will really have no foothold. Therefore, I think that we should take advantage of this national goods year and do our best to publicize and promote it, so that native cloth and silk can restore their inherent uses. Even on the end of noodles, we should abandon foreign flour. Chinese yarn factories and flour factories can unite as one and directly set up consumer cooperatives in various cities, so that those who have purchasing power will not buy the wrong things, just like the food of the Qingzhen religion. I think that people's hearts have not died, and they will not be indifferent, and the rise and fall of the world is the responsibility of every man. The method we should urgently rise up and strive to drive out is only in these three items of cotton, wheat, and rice. Just look at the customs' annual accounts. Only these three items have an import surplus of more than 500 million. If we can recover the rights and interests of these three items, it will be enough to transform the import surplus into an export surplus. The matter is very clear, and the power is in the hands of any individual. Those who do not listen, unless they are madmen, Mencius once said: "How is a madman different from a bird or beast? How do people differ from birds or beasts?" Then it can be seen from clothing, food, and materials. Clothing and beasts are shameful. The host is extravagant, and the guests are "swine." It is very disrespectful, and it is tolerable, which is intolerable. Loving what good people hate, and hating what bad people like, disasters will surely befall oneself. I wish that the people of the country would use their conscience to act, and use their good likes and dislikes to reverse their origin. I hope that China will have a trace of it.</p>
<p>National Goods Discussion</p>
<h3>Tasks After the National Goods Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>The national goods exhibitions that have recently flourished in various places have expanded publicity and have been very popular for a while. Since the closing of the national goods exhibitions in Jia County, Ningbo, and Zhenjiang, there have been simultaneous exhibitions in Nanjing and Qingdao, and the continued establishment of Weihaiwei and Fujian Province. It is said that Siam and Singapore, which are far across the ocean, will also be preparing to go there. In this year, our national goods industry is intensifying its work and working hard to carry out. We know that our country has a vast territory and a large population, and has historically suffered from the dumping of foreign goods, which has filled the interior. The general public is accustomed to using foreign goods. Now, if we want to develop national goods, we must go deep into the people and make sure that everyone knows about it. The national goods exhibition is the only weapon to guide us forward, so that the general public can get a considerable understanding and close integration. The intention is profound, needless to say, and its effect and mission are naturally the first and most important work in our process of developing national goods.</p>
<p>However, the national goods exhibition, which is temporary in nature, only has a permanent exhibition hall, and its opening period is always very short. We can review the facts of the past, and the past exhibitions have always ended with the closing, and often refuse to make more efforts. In fact, this is completely wrong. The closing of the national goods exhibition can only be acknowledged as having completed the first part of the national goods process, and cannot be considered as having completed the task. It must be known that the effect of the national goods exhibition is only to make the general public temporarily excited. If we do not continue to work hard, we still cannot firmly develop their will to purchase national goods, so it is empty. After the completion of this paragraph, we should urgently do some practical work and carry out the work in a concrete way. As far as the scope of my vision extends, the national goods exhibition should have the following tasks: 1. Create a permanent agency. No matter where it is, when the national goods exhibition is about to close for the first time, the people of all walks of life will definitely have a closer sense of goodwill towards the national goods than at any other time. We should really take advantage of this good opportunity to further establish a permanent agency on the spot. According to the national goods production and sales report, Qingdao and Nanjing have organized a national goods company after the initial cessation of the exhibition, and the future is smooth, and it will be opened soon. This kind of practical work will inevitably expand the future of national goods. 2. Contact local vendors or people's organizations. As mentioned above, it is easier to set up such an agency in major commercial ports. However, due to the different conditions in various places and the prosperity and decline of commerce, the organization and establishment may be impossible. Then we can only sincerely contact local vendors or people's organizations, establish mutual agreements, and continue to order directly from national goods manufacturers in Shanghai after the closing, then although the national exhibition is closed, the spirit is still there, and the merit will last forever, which is also the work that we cannot postpone. At the time when national exhibitions in various places are about to close, I would like to offer my humble opinions to the national goods pioneers. What do you think?</p>
<p>New Industrial Introduction</p>
<h3>National Goods Lock</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>A fellow villager, Mr. Yang Zhiyi, gathered capital and assembled skilled craftsmen to establish a small-scale metalworking factory at No. 8 Jiadeli, Hujia Mu Bridge, Hongkou. They started by manufacturing various types of locks, as a starting point for future business expansion, which is commendable. They have already produced a type of tumbler door lock, trademarked with a dog logo, symbolizing the idea of a guard dog protecting the door, comparable to imported "Spirella" locks. However, the price is particularly low, at two yuan and fifty cents per set. The lock's materials are entirely made from domestic products, making it even more worthy of promotion. According to Mr. Yang, the advantages of the dog logo lock are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The spring at the top of the tumbler uses acid-resistant chemical steel wire, which never rusts, and its elasticity is about twice as strong as other copper wire springs.</p>
<p>(2) The spring is not ○-shaped, but ◐-shaped, to reduce resistance.</p>
<p>(3) The tip of the tumbler is machined into a convex shape, allowing the spring to fit properly on it, avoiding the disadvantage of getting stuck. (4) All the holes accommodating the tumbler springs are drilled with a special drill bit, so the distance and depth are uniform, and the key enters and exits without any hindrance.</p>
<p>I have personally seen the lock, and it is indeed very strong and durable. It also includes a small booklet with illustrations and instructions, which also contains cautionary language, such as "We should naturally buy domestic products over non-domestic products. When comparing domestic products, we should naturally buy the better ones." There are also three slogans: "We oppose shoddy workmanship, we want to enhance the glory of national products, and we only wish for criticism from our fellow countrymen."</p>
<p>Mr. Yang and others are indeed working diligently and practically. I dare to introduce this new industry in this valuable space, hoping that it will be welcome news to national products companies and compatriots alike.</p>

<h3>New Product: National Goods Clock</h3>
<p>— Yiju</p>
<p>A clock is an essential item for ordinary families. However, most clocks used by Chinese people are imported. Domestically produced clocks are rarely seen in the domestic market, so the import volume of foreign clocks is very large each year. This is due to the lack of attention from domestic industrialists, and also to the psychology of Chinese people who prefer to buy foreign goods.</p>
<p>The clock manufacturing department of the Changming Electric Company in Shanghai has been working hard to produce national goods clocks in recent years. Their products are innovative in style, refined, and accurate. Not only are they the first of their kind in the country, but they can also compete with imported products. Therefore, since their launch, they have been well-received by people from all walks of life, and their business is also quite developed. It is expected that the company will have new developments in the future.</p>
<p>Recently, in order to expand publicity, so as to awaken the attention of people from all walks of life, and in response to the requirements of various circles, the company held a national goods clock exhibition for three days at the Shenchang Watch Shop near the Nanjing Road Ball Field, from August 3rd to 15th, which was well-received and noticed by all circles.</p>

<h3>A Humorous View of the Cuban Revolution</h3>
<p>— Zhanqing</p>
<p>In this revolutionary year, revolutions are constantly erupting in countries around the world. Recently, I found the Cuban revolution to be quite humorous.</p>
<p>President Machado, Secretary of State Ferrara, and Army Chief of Staff Herrera were all ousted under the banner of the revolutionary army. The Chinese translations of their Western names are based on homophones and are not fixed. However, if Machado is translated as "Curse Street Crosser," Ferrara as "Cut and Pull," and Herrera as "Blindly Pull," then it becomes humorous.</p>
<p>"Curse Street Crosser" became president, causing widespread public resentment. This time, he was abandoned by all and could not stand his ground. He had to escape by plane. Since the people could not catch the president, they naturally cursed loudly in the streets. Thus, "Curse Street Crosser" flew across the sky amidst the curses in the streets. How humorous is the Cuban fugitive president, "Curse Street Crosser."</p>
<p>Before "Curse Street Crosser" fled, he issued an order appointing Army Chief of Staff "Blindly Pull" as interim president. Since "Curse Street Crosser" had lost popular support, the interim president "Blindly Pull," appointed by "Curse Street Crosser," was also not welcomed by the people. With only two hours of fate, that president "Blindly Pull" was forced away by the people. "Five-day magistrate of the capital" is already considered short-lived, but "Blindly Pull's" two-hour presidency is even shorter and more rushed. Doesn't this become an ephemeral government, a flash-in-the-pan president? The three characters "Blindly Pull" are truly befitting the name. "Curse Street Crosser" was eager to escape and grabbed anyone in desperation, regardless of whether they were competent, and randomly appointed "Blindly Pull" as interim president. Pulling people blindly with blind eyes, aren't the three characters "Blindly Pull" truly befitting the name?</p>
<p>The Cuban Secretary of State is called "Cut and Pull." One "Pull," another "Pull." Could they be organizing a cheerleading squad? "Cut and Pull" is also a treasure. The people hated him to the core. They stormed into "Cut and Pull's" office and launched a collective attack. Fortunately, "Cut and Pull" was quick on his feet and fled to the airport, escaping to America by plane, and was not caught by the attackers. If he had been a step slower, the attackers would have chased him to the airport and grabbed him. That would have truly been a "Cut and Pull" who lived up to his name. Another saying goes: If the attackers grabbed him, he would be "Cut and Pull." If the attackers could not grab him and he escaped, then he would have been pulled to the Western Paradise, like a ferryman pulling the Buddha, and he would be "Buddha Pull," so "Cut and Pull" can also be called "Buddha Pull."</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Talks on Fans</h3>
<p>— Miaoshen</p>
<p>"I only saw her twisting her body, getting into the car, sitting sideways, and throwing a delicate goose feather fan in front of her chest." This is how a novelist describes a young woman using a fan as an ornament, written with grace and charm! "His soy sauce-colored back was covered with sweat beads the size of soybeans, and sweat poured down his forehead and chin like rain. He waved a palm-leaf fan, but even though he shook it up and down with a whirring sound, it didn't seem to reduce his heat at all." This is another scene of a novelist describing a laborer "sweating."</p>
<p>We certainly acknowledge that women and men are somewhat different. You see, even in the scorching summer, women wear a gauze shirt as thin as cicada wings, and we can vaguely see their flesh color and two snow-white undergarments, but we rarely see them sweating profusely, sticking the gauze shirt to their skin. How could a paper-thin gauze shirt not be soaked with sweat? In contrast, men's long gowns usually have sweat stains on the back.</p>
<p>Some say that women are calm, so they don't sweat easily. Even when they are hot, they only take a fan and gently fan their chest, unlike men who are often covered in sweat and only fan their heads frantically.</p>
<p>Women are indeed calm, but they are still far less so than older monks. You see, when monks feel hot, they only gently fan the palms of their hands with a fan. And look at the laborers, when they get hot, they frantically fan their crotches with a palm-leaf fan, which is truly laughable!</p>
<p>Westerners don't take fans even on hot days, but we don't see them sweating profusely. Chinese people seem to sweat more comparatively, I think.</p>
<p>In a ditty: "A seven-inch-long fan, one person fans, two people cool down"; the words are crude, but they have a certain charm. In the past, people mostly fell in love secretly, using cooling off as an excuse, so "one person fans, two people cool down," pouring out their private feelings. Now, people fall in love openly, without avoiding ears and eyes, arranging for lovers to stroll in the park together, leaning against each other and kissing in public. In the past, barber shops were equipped with white bamboo cloth pull fans in the summer. Apprentices were ordered to pull the rope in the corner of the room by hand, creating a breeze, but this kind of fan was clumsy and the wind was small. Now, most barber shops are equipped with electric fans, which shows that fans have also kept pace with the times.</p>
<h3>In the Dance Hall</h3>
<p>— Donghai Bochen</p>
<p>In this intoxicating dance hall, everything contains a mysterious atmosphere. The intoxication of wine, the enticement of flesh, the vortex of smiles, the charming eyes, the snow-white jade legs... these, like snakes, will make your soul sink.</p>
<p>The waiters in snow-white uniforms fly back and forth like birds. They guide the dancers, batch after batch... but without any fatigue. The dance time has not arrived yet! The dancers are all joking in low voices. Several dance girls who live by their thighs are quietly practicing tango-style dance steps in the smooth-as-mirror hall, so fleshy and drunken!</p>
<p>In a corner, a dance girl sits on the lap of a young man in a suit. They are imitating the kissing pose of McDonald and Schiffer in "The Merry Widow."</p>
<p>"Hey! I'm out of money." The dance girl says in a low voice. "Ah!" A large stack of banknotes slides into the dance girl's hand. The first dance begins. In the dark hall, the whole place is shaking with shadows, faces, chests... How close they are. "Dance!" "..." Hot blood boils, just like a soldier going to his death calmly.</p>
<p>The purple light shines on the whole hall again, jokes and love words begin to liven up. The second dance begins, the third dance... In the fish-belly-white dawn, one by one, they go home with fatigue. The waiters in the dance hall are busy cleaning up the hall again, preparing for the dancers of tomorrow to dance!</p>
<h3>Face-Changing Art</h3>
<p>— Zuichisheng</p>
<p>One day, I and several friends were drinking in a restaurant in Beishi. There were three young men in suits at the next table, all speaking very fluent English. At first, I thought there must be a foreign friend among them. Later, I took a closer look at their faces and realized that they were all "genuine" compatriots, and I was not surprised. They sometimes interspersed with a few Chinese words, but only one or two out of ten. From this conversation, I learned that they were all "university" graduates and were now doing business in foreign firms. I said to my friends: These pseudo-new characters are considered urban darlings. They are full of foreign flavor, wearing foreign clothes, speaking foreign languages, learning foreign ways, eating foreign food, and talking about foreign principles. They think they are very stylish with their "foreign reasons and foreign accents." But it's a pity that their noses are too low, which is the only flaw. Without that high "prominent nose," they can't compare with real white people. Now, it's good that science is developed and often "seizes the work of heaven." I heard that in Europe and America, a new "face-changing art" has been invented. If the eyes are blinded, they can be replaced with eyes that are exactly the same as the real ones. If the nose is too low and unsightly, it can also be raised in the same way, without any traces. This kind of "transformation doctor" can be invited to your noble China to meet the needs of society and open several "face-changing clinics" in the city, to transform these "foreign-obsessed" compatriots from head to toe. First, raise the most important nose. Then, use chemicals to dye the black hair brown. (This is something that modern women also strongly agree with.) Then, apply chemicals all over the body to turn the yellow skin white. And let the body hair grow shaggy. In this way, you can do whatever you want and get what you want. Although racially, they are counterfeit foreigners, but formally, they are completely foreigners, and there is no need to immigrate to any foreign country. At that time, they will be complacent and arrogant. Even if the country is destroyed, they will not be afraid. Everything, everything, they don't have to worry about. Isn't this a great creation? Several friends applauded and praised.</p>
<p>At this time, the three young men seemed to have heard it. They were still "ABC," talking enthusiastically. So I recorded this conversation. I would like to tell all the "Western-style compatriots" in the world that they can follow this method in the future, and the "ideal" will one day become a "reality"!</p>
<h3>Four Company Commanders of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Thirteen: Ye Zhi Sees a Soulmate's Silent Promise; Cheng Jia Receives Cheerful Celebration from Healthy Sons</p>
<p>Guan Yaowu said with a smile: I wanted to drink winter melon soup, how could I not run? Gui Zhi, hearing this, was not shy and sat boldly on the edge of the pit. Guan Yaowu smiled: Did cousin also know I would come? We have serious matters to discuss. Knowing I was coming, you shouldn't have dodged away. Gui Zhi said: Why would I dodge you? I went to a neighbor's house next door for something. Guan Yaowu said: It's good that you're back. Aunt is currently undecided about this matter, you... Gui Zhi, with a straight face, interrupted and said: Marriage is not like buying and selling odd bits and pieces, with a bran to swap back and forth. How we talked before, we still talk now. We don't mean for people to resign from their posts. As long as people have a sincere heart, whether as friends or relatives, it's stronger than anything else. Guan Yaowu said with a smile: That being said, Lao Zhao is considered sincere. For you, he is willing to resign from his post as company commander. Gui Zhi didn't say anything, but smiled slightly. Guan Yaowu, seeing her demeanor, knew that she was agreeing a thousand times, ten thousand times. Zhao Ziqiang's determination to sacrifice was not in vain. Guan Yaowu stood up and said with a smile: Since that's the case, the matter is settled. I'll send a letter back to Lao Zhao. Saying this, he stood up. Gui Zhi said: Cousin, we are relatives... Saying this, she burst out laughing. Guan Yaowu was somewhat stunned by this. We are relatives, so what? While thinking this, he looked at Gui Zhi and couldn't say anything. Gui Zhi said with a smile: Why are you stunned? I'm not saying anything else. I thought that since we are relatives, you have to take care of me a little in case of trouble. Don't tell anyone what I just said to you. Otherwise, I didn't say it. Guan Yaowu said with a smile: Miss, you are really good, wanting both the substance and the appearance. We are relatives, I have to do that. Rest assured, at this time, even if you were crowned king, would I dare to offend you? And so he laughed and left. (160)</p>
<p>Common Knowledge</p>
<h3>Common Sense of Eating Watermelon</h3>
<p>— Zhuying Ziqingji</p>
<p>Once summer arrives, any fine wine, delicacies, or rare delicacies cannot compare to the deliciousness of eating watermelon.</p>
<p>However, before slicing and eating, we must know whether the watermelon is ripe. As the saying goes, guessing a melon through its skin, how can we guess accurately? Even if the watermelon is fully ripe, it's like winning the lottery, just a lucky chance and not something you can obtain with certainty. So how do we know if the watermelon is fully ripe?</p>
<p>Listen to the melon, everyone. Use your hand to knock on the outer skin of the watermelon and listen to the sound. Then you will know. Or ask, what sound is ripe, and what sound is not ripe? Everyone, just listen to the sound of the watermelon. If it sounds like striking a fish drum, and the sound is pleasant, it indicates that the melon is fully ripe and will not be unripe at all. Otherwise, if the sound is dull, distinctly different from a ripe one, then the watermelon is not yet ripe. However, it is difficult to distinguish this kind of sound selection at first. But if you have to study this listening melon problem, you must place two or three melons side by side, knock and listen, and it will be easy to hear.</p>
<p>Knocking the melon is much easier than listening to the melon. How to knock? Please hold a watermelon weighing more than ten pounds in your own left hand, and gently knock it with your own right hand. If the sound of the right hand vibrates your left hand, then this watermelon is already ripe. If your left hand holds the watermelon, and when you tap it lightly with your right hand, you don't see any vibration, it means that this watermelon is still far from being ripe. Also, if the watermelon first vibrates straight into the palm of your hand when you gently tap it, then this watermelon has already matured too much. Everyone, when you knock, if you have these three phenomena, you can definitely know whether the watermelon is ripe or not.</p>
<p>I have already talked about pinching the melon, knocking the melon, and listening to the melon. I will report a few more words to everyone about pinching the melon, which is even easier. Everyone, lift the melon with both hands, and press the upper end of the melon tightly with the thumbs of your left and right hands, and try to pinch it hard. If it sounds like rustling, then the melon is already ripe. Conversely, it is not. But don't use too much force, if the force is too strong and you encounter a thin melon, it is easy to pinch it open.</p>
<p>The color of the melon pulp can be roughly divided into three types: red, white, yellow, etc., with white being the best and red being the most delicious. The color is as red as rouge, with black seeds and a green skin, and everyone loves it. Even just thinking about it makes you feel delicious, but it is also very difficult to guess whether the color of the melon pulp is red or white. You can just look at the color of the melon vine, whether it is dark green or light green, and you will know the color of the melon pulp at a glance. If the melon vine is dark green, the melon pulp must be red. If the melon vine is light green, the melon pulp must be white. If the melon vine is light green and slightly yellow, the melon pulp must be yellow. Just like when you look at the color of a peony flower, first look at the leaves of the peony flower, the same method. Once you understand this method of looking at flowers, you will know everything about looking at melons.</p>
<p>When cutting a watermelon, be sure to use a sharp knife separately. No one is allowed to use this knife to cut fish, meat, scallions, garlic, and all vegetables. It is best to use a bamboo knife to prevent the steel knife from often having a rusty smell, which cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>You must pay attention to the dry vine. Generally, every watermelon is connected to a one-inch-long green vine. Or attached to half a small green leaf in the shape of a palm. If there is no watermelon with this fresh vine, people say it is a dry vine. A dry vine means that the watermelon was picked when it was not ripe. The maturity of the melon is due to being placed until it is ripe, not growing ripe on the vine. The taste of this kind of melon that is placed until it is ripe is of course not fresh, tender, and unpalatable.</p>
<p>If one or two of the watermelons you bought are not very ripe, you can put them aside for three or five days, or seven or eight days, and they will slowly ripen. Watermelon must not be exposed to rain, it is most prone to rot when exposed to rain, or explode at that time. Usually, it is placed in the room or under the shade of a tree.</p>
<p>After you cut open a watermelon, can you eat it all, or can't you eat it all? You must not eat leftover watermelon, because after it is cut open, it is easy to attract flies, easy to produce microorganisms, and especially easy to cause disease. Even if the watermelon you cut is not very sweet, you should not add white sugar, because if you add sugar, it will only have the sweet taste of sweet sugar, and you will not be able to taste the fresh taste of watermelon.</p>
<p>Among the places in our country that produce watermelons, the Lama melon from Dezhou, Shandong is the most famous and the cheapest. The shape of the melon is like a pillow, so some people say it is a pillow melon, or a Lama melon. The locals say it is a Dezhou melon. The color of the melon pulp is like rouge, and the sweetness is like jade dew. Anyone who meets a Dezhou person must buy a piece to taste, otherwise they have wasted a trip to Dezhou.</p>

<h3>"Squeezing Oil"</h3>
<p>— Bensuo</p>
<p>"Squeezing oil" completely describes the behavior of a lackey.</p>
<p>This is not "taking kickbacks" or "taking commissions," because this is a secret; but it is not stealing either, because in principle, what is taken is actually very little. Therefore, it cannot be said to be "dividing the spoils"; at most, it can be called "malpractice." However, this is also open and aboveboard "malpractice," because what is taken belongs to wealthy families, rich men, the well-to-do, and foreign merchants, and what is taken is only a little bit, just like wiping it from a place full of oil, which does not harm the other person but benefits the wiper, and it is also a righteous way to relieve the poor by harming the rich. Trying to make a woman smile a few times, or taking the opportunity to touch her, is also called "squeezing oil." Although this is not as legitimate as squeezing oil for money, it is also true that it does not greatly harm the one being squeezed.</p>
<p>The most obvious example is the ticket seller on the streetcar. After becoming skilled, he pays attention to the guests who can be squeezed on the one hand, and to sudden ticket inspections on the other. His eyes have been trained to be like a mixture of a mouse and an eagle. Paying money without giving a ticket is something the guest should demand, but it is difficult to demand, and no one is ever seen demanding it, because what he is squeezing is the oil of foreign merchants. Since they are all Chinese, there is of course an obligation to help. Demanding a ticket would mean helping the foreign merchants. At this time, not only will the ticket seller give you a hateful look, but even the guests in the same car will often show a look that implies you are ignorant of current affairs.</p>
<p>However, that was one time, this is another. If a copper coin is occasionally missing from a third-class passenger, you will have to get off the car before reaching your destination. At this time, he will not be accommodating and becomes a loyal servant of the foreign merchants.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, if you chat with policemen, doormen, or servants, they mostly hate the foreign devils, and they are mostly patriots. However, like the foreign devils, they also look down on the Chinese. Sticks, fists, and contemptuous looks are focused on the Chinese.</p>
<p>The life of "squeezing oil" is blessed. This method will be further developed, this character will become noble, this behavior will be considered proper, and this will be regarded as the national ability and the counter-damage to imperialism. To be frank, in fact, the so-called "high-class Chinese" also cannot escape this mold. But, like the "eating idle food" friends, the ticket seller still has his morality. If the ticket inspector finds out that he collected money without giving a ticket, he will silently accept the fine and never say that he did not collect the money, pushing the crime onto the guest.</p>
<h3>Discussion of "Ode to the Ugly Woman by Liu Sizhen"</h3>
<p>— Yu Ping</p>
<p>In the Free Discussion section of the August 12th issue, Mr. Zizhan's essay "Rhymes and Novels" cited Liu Sizhen's "Ode to the Ugly Woman" from the pre-Tang dynasty writings compiled by Yan Kejun, stating that many of the words and phrases were incomprehensible and suspected to be contemporary slang or misprints. According to my research, this text originally appeared in Volume 19, "Human Affairs, Inferior People" of Xu Jian's "Elementary Records" from the Tang Dynasty. The text differs slightly from the version cited by Mr. Zizhan. I am now recording the original text below, with any discrepancies from Mr. Zizhan's citation noted:</p>
<p>"Everyone obtains a beautiful wife, but why is my fate uniquely blameworthy? Not encountering Jiang Ren and De, I precisely meet an ugly and wicked wife. Her talent and disposition are base and stingy, her appearance is even worse than Mo Mu's. (Mr. Zizhan's 'appearance' is written as 'assets'). She has a deer's head and a monkey's face, a mallet-like nose and a protruding mouth. (Mr. Zizhan's 'mallet nose' is written as 'pushing forehead'). A broken nose with sunken cheeks and a collapsing nose (Mr. Zizhan's 'sunken cheeks' is written as 'loathing forehead'), her eyes are squinted like □ (original note: pronounced 'jiao'). Her skin is like old mulberry bark, her ears are like hands placed on their side. Her head is like a rice-milling pestle, her hair is like a worn-out broom. Her ugly appearance and demeanor (Mr. Zizhan's 'ugly' is written as 'loathing') are not as attractive as a door knocker. (Mr. Zizhan's 'as' is written as 'like'). She is dull and clumsy when combing her hair, and her embellishments only make her uglier. Her makeup on her cheeks is like a dog's lick, and her forehead is particularly thick. (Mr. Zizhan's 'particularly' is written as 'especially'). Red □ is like splashed blood, (Mr. Zizhan's 'like' is written as 'adding') how can her drawn eyebrows bear the burden of a rat? Powder is piled under her chin, and it is not evenly distributed across her face. (Mr. Zizhan's 'evenly' is written as 'biased'). Her collar is like a bag of salted beans, (Mr. Zizhan's 'beans' is written as 'drums') and her sleeves are like constantly wiping the pot. Her shoes are like walking in mud, and her nails are dirty. Her chapped feet can hold chopsticks, (Mr. Zizhan's 'chapped' is written as 'chapped') staring at them makes people vomit."</p>
<p>Comparing the two side by side, Mr. Zizhan's version does indeed have erroneous characters. With slight corrections, the difficult-to-understand phrases can mostly be deciphered. However, the line "A broken nose with sunken cheeks and a collapsing nose" is still not easily understood, and it is still suspected that the character "sunken" is a mistake. The "Elementary Records" includes the "Ode to the Ugly Woman" alongside Pang Lang's "Ode to the Pockmarked Man" and Zhu Yan's "Ode to the Black Child." For the odes to Pang Lang and the Black Child, only a few lines are recorded, with the comment that "the words are too broad to be fully recorded." The "Ode to the Ugly Woman" does not have this comment, suggesting that the entire text was quoted. Mr. Zizhan's suspicion that it is not a complete text is likely incorrect.</p>
<h3>Record of Watching Elephants at the Zoological Garden</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>When I arrived in Beiping, the third batch of antiquities had already been moved south.</p>
<p>The Forbidden City was deeply locked, with two ancient cannons lying in front of the Meridian Gate. Willow branches hung on the walls, and tourists could only wander around outside the walls in bewilderment. Zhongnanhai Park had become the camp of a certain minister, and military police stood guard outside the yellow glazed tile gate, blocking the path of would-be tourists. But Beiping was still grand after all; there was still Zhongshan Park where one could drink tea, Beihai Park where one could admire the lotus flowers, and Shicha Lake where one could watch street performers. Outside the city, one could visit the Summer Palace and travel to the Western Hills to drink Yiquanshan soda, "the best spring water under heaven." For an extra two mao, one could also stroll through the Wansheng Yuan and the Garden of the Third Prince.</p>
<p>The tall man Chang Shude had left, but this was no more than a drop in the ocean for Wansheng Yuan. The remaining nine thousand nine hundred and ninety creatures were still there for people to observe: rabbits, pugs, long-tailed foxes, everything one could want. But among them, the crocodile and the elephant were the most eye-catching.</p>
<p>It is said that crocodiles have a spiritual nature. The great Renaissance master Han Yu even wrote a long essay about them. I thought crocodiles must be a civilized species that understood Chinese characters, and deserved special respect. But the result of this special respect was that it was such a ferocious, wretched, and stupid thing. Since the star of literature is usually portrayed as having a green face and fangs, what else can be said?</p>
<p>The elephant's body is truly enormous, possessing the imposing manner of a sovereign ruler. Yet it is arbitrarily driven by its elephant keeper and is even more docile than a pug. It faithfully earns money for its master, only chewing on a bit of grass for itself. Sometimes, it doesn't even get that bit of grass and can only extend its long trunk to be deceived and teased by tourists. One day, the day when I went to see it with two friends, it actually got angry. A gentleman of the fashionable type, dressed in a Western suit, first lured it with grass, toying with it and not letting its trunk grab the grass. Later, he stuck a half-lit cigarette into its long trunk. It flew into a rage. After hesitating for a moment, it suddenly sprayed a trunkful of dirty water onto the man next to it, who was wearing old clothes. It was a completely undeserved disaster, and that man was out of luck. But this was extremely logical. Although that man had not provoked it, wasn't it more appropriate to offend the man in old clothes than to offend the man in the fashionable suit? This must have been taught to it by its clever master, after careful calculation.</p>
<p>According to the local guide, this elephant is very famous. It had lured many wild elephants, whose wildness had not yet been tamed, into traps and earned honor for doing so. It had truly exerted itself for its master. It turns out that it is so experienced in harming its own kind; no wonder it is so skilled in bullying the weak and fearing the strong! There is no doubt that the elephant species will soon be listed among those who have contributed to the world and to people's morals!</p>
<h3>The Truth of Tsurumi Yūsuke</h3>
<p>— Sun Yong</p>
<p>Tsurumi Yūsuke, it is said that his specialty is law, and he advocates liberalism.</p>
<p>Recently, I read his essay, "Reflections on Rome" (The Yellow Bell Bi-Monthly, No. 28). It is a piece of writing that allows one to recognize his true face.</p>
<p>He said: "In order to seek the truth, I spent two and a half years wandering the world... I traveled from west to east, from north to south." I find it strange: before these "two and a half years," he presumably had no "truth" at all. "Truth" was originally like the Golden Fleece, waiting to be explored and appreciated. Later, he returned to his country, and reportedly, "as the first souvenir of his return, he presented this article to the enthusiastic and chivalrous young men and women of Japan." He brought his truth to Japan:</p>
<p>"On September 18, Showa 6 [1931], the sound of a single cannon fired outside Fengtian [Mukden] reverberated throughout every corner of the six continents of the world.</p>
<p>"In this place, a new page in world history has been opened." "The Japanese people cannot retreat from this step that has already been taken."</p>
<p>"Forward!"</p>
<p>"This is the voice of Napoleon's most proud moment. The only path for the survival of the Japanese people is to move forward." "Surging in the tide of this great era, the ninety million Japanese people are now embarking on a great journey in world history."</p>
<p>However, "articles can be viewed from two sides." With the emperor above and the lackeys below, in the eyes of the "emperor," wouldn't Tsurumi Yūsuke be a loyal subject with a red heart? For the sake of his "motherland Japan," we can forgive him.</p>
<p>The following is addressed to our translators.</p>
<p>I often think of gathering the strength of many people to translate foreign writings about us; whether they are insults or blind praise, they will surely benefit us. As the saying goes, "The stones from other hills can be used to polish jade." But the most important thing is to "grasp the truth and not be swayed by any propaganda." This is what translators of such writings should know.</p>
<p>For example, this piece by Tsurumi Yūsuke on "Seeking the Truth" can at least allow us to recognize him, the true face of a liberal. To be a slave: from the master's perspective, of course, one feels "uniquely superior." When a third party sees it, they may not feel any concern or pain, or perhaps they will coldly mock it. As for the slave themselves, apart from a talented slave, they will never sincerely and willingly say, "The king is wise, I am to blame."</p>
<p>However, the person who translated this article, in his "Translator's Note," said with "uncontrollable emotion": "Mr. Tsurumi Yūsuke, who has always advocated heroic politics, genius politics, passionately promoting romanticism, literary heroism, hating capitalist parliamentary politics, and loathing vulgar culture and American culture, in this article, his great character, lofty insights, and irrepressible patriotic fervor leap even more vividly from the page..." I wonder, is this translator even Chinese?</p>
<h3>Maxims of La Bruyère</h3>
<p>— Fu De</p>
<p>Women are all extremes; they are either better than men or worse than men.</p>
<p>In matters of love, women are more profound than most men; but in matters of friendship, men are more profound than women.</p>
<p>A man keeps the secrets of others more securely than his own; conversely, a woman keeps her own secrets more securely than those of others.</p>
<p>Vanity and love can cure a woman's laziness. And in a vibrant woman, laziness is the prelude to love.</p>
<p>Sometimes when a woman hides her passion from a man, that man pretends to have a passion for her that he doesn't actually have.</p>
<h3>Autumn and Spring (Continued and Finished)</h3>
<p>— Lin Huiyin</p>
<p>"Didn't reply to the letter? That's because," he patted his pocket, "that's because I didn't read it right away. That's right, I'll thank you in person now, you sent my book back."</p>
<p>"Do you often write poetry?"</p>
<p>"Not often. Do you like poetry a lot?"</p>
<p>Lu Xian nodded.</p>
<p>Si Bin felt a little uncomfortable, and he remembered that he hadn't eaten anything yet. The thought made him feel especially hungry. "I haven't eaten anything since last night, can you accompany me to get something to eat?"</p>
<p>"Since last night?"</p>
<p>"Yes, since last night I've been waiting for this meeting, so I forgot to eat."</p>
<p>"Were you writing poetry?"</p>
<p>"No, this is definitely prose."</p>
<p>Lu Xian went to her room for about a quarter of an hour, and then went out with Si Bin. In the late autumn, under the setting sun, they walked to a nearby cafe. He ordered chicken and salad and a glass of whiskey soda; she wasn't hungry and only wanted a glass of iced chocolate.</p>
<p>Hearing the word whiskey, Lu Xian felt a pang, because someone she was very close to could be said to have died from whiskey. When the things they ordered arrived, she seemed to be watching Si Bin eat, but was actually immersed in her own memories. She was thinking that men were really strange. When they hadn't obtained the woman they wanted, they always tried every possible way to get her. But once they got her, they seemed to disregard her with indifference. If it weren't for that, the person closest to her wouldn't have died.</p>
<p>Si Bin saw Lu Xian's contemplation and didn't want to interrupt it. He simply maintained the silence until he had finished his chicken and salad.</p>
<p>"Smoke?"</p>
<p>"Oh!" Lu Xian took a cigarette from the box that was handed to her.</p>
<p>"I didn't think to offer you one just now, sorry," Si Bin struck a match to light it for her, and lit his own.</p>
<p>"I'm smoking this because I'm afraid of letting you down, I don't smoke often."</p>
<p>"Thank you. But I would like to ask you to do me a favor, please accompany me abroad."</p>
<p>"Accompany you abroad?"</p>
<p>"Yes, is that possible?"</p>
<p>"Do I have to answer immediately?"</p>
<p>"Although it doesn't have to be immediate, hesitation doesn't seem to help the answer. I can be more explicit, Lu Xian, we can use any name, as long as you are willing to be with me, and I will never force you to do anything you don't want to do. Please agree to this, how about it?"</p>
<p>"I agree, Si Bin," she had never encountered such a rapid request before, and she couldn't bear to refuse.</p>
<p>Si Bin asked for a newspaper and searched for the shipping reports with Lu Xian, to see which ship to take to which country.</p>

<p>October Call Money</p>
<p>The Market Opens with a Steady Attitude</p>
<p>Although Lower, the Volume of Short Covering Remains High</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market remained steady. The shorts could not hold out for long, and the atmosphere of short covering remained strong. In the morning, due to declines in the British and American silver markets, the British-American and American-British exchange rates continued to trend downwards. The five metals exchange's forward silver price fell 3 li. There was no movement in American wheat, and American cotton fell 19 points. Stock price increases and decreases were minimal. The wool market opened at 77.78 yuan, and gradually declined afterwards due to market sentiment. After the opening, due to the strengthening of the exchange rate, banks supplied more aggressively at lower prices, and prices retreated to within 70 yuan for quite some time. As banks took advantage of the low prices to acquire, and silver companies covered their near-term US dollar positions, prices gradually rebounded. Speculator Wu and others, as well as Western merchants in the Hong Kong and Mongolian gold industry, scrambled to cover their positions, and the situation continued to strengthen, but mostly with struggles. The final result, calculated with the addition of the premium paid by the swap longs, was higher than the previous close. Reports of Pittman's comments on the silver agreement, as well as a Reuters dispatch midway through the day stating that the US was considering encouraging agricultural product exports and raising the prices of wheat and cotton, lacked stimulation, as they were already a thing of the past. The high price of raw silver remained at 180 yuan plus, and the Tianjin gang continued to supply. The September-October swap was priced from 6 yuan to 6.5 yuan. The situation in the market for half a day is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was at 872.8 yuan, with the premium rising slightly by 1.8 yuan compared to the previous close, after deducting the swap. Goods opened at 2.2 yuan. The exchange market opened with the selling price for near-term British currency at 1 shilling, 2 and 7/8 pence, and the US dollar at 27.375 yuan. Sassoon and others sold aggressively, and the Chinese firms actually sold the same month at 8.125 yuan, reducing it from 3 yuan to 67 yuan. Yuansheng, Yongheng, Yu Hongli and others acquired contracts at low prices and rose to over 70 yuan, but Dadecheng, Fuyu and others continued to sell, and prices retreated again to 67.6 yuan. It was heard that HSBC quoted 1.125 shillings for the pound, and the US dollar remained unchanged. At this time, the price hovered around 9 yuan. Dongya sold November US dollars at 9.375 yuan, and Pan Gen covered at the same price. At this time, the situation was uncertain and fluctuating. Pan Gen ate November US dollars at 9.375 yuan, and Sumitomo covered September at 5.625 yuan, and prices rose to 73.7 yuan. Hengxing and Wanxing came to sell and prices retreated to within 2 yuan. Afterwards, silver companies aggressively covered their near-term US dollar positions, and Yuanmao, Yongheng, Yu Zhengchang and others aggressively bought goods, and the situation strengthened upwards. Although Pan Gen sold October US dollars at 8.75 yuan, Zhaofengchang, Wanxing, Shunli and others still advanced, and prices gradually rose. During this time, although Fuyu, Yuanmao and Hengxing supplied, afterwards Zhifengyong aggressively covered US dollars, and November had 75 and 68.75 yuan matched up. Shunli, Hongli, Ruikang, Zhaofengchang, Yuanxiang, Zhifengyong and others in the market worked hard to acquire contracts, market sentiment was boosted, and prices rose to 5.7 yuan. Wa Bee came out with October US dollars at 5.625 yuan. Slight unfavorable news from the wire services caused Dadecheng and Shunmao to dispose of holdings, and prices decreased to 3.8 yuan. But due to eager short covering, the domestic market was dry. Yuanmao, Yongrui, Kangqianchang, Xiangyuanchun and others came with even more aggressive purchases, and prices rose to 6.3 yuan. Goods and others supplied contracts, Yuanmao sold again, and Zhongfu came out with November US dollars at 75 yuan, and prices were at 4 yuan. The noon close was at 875.2 yuan. After the close, goods were pressed down, and Chunyuanyong and others aggressively supplied over a thousand contracts. Although Hengyu advanced, prices still fell to within 3 yuan. Goods were auctioned at 3.5 yuan. The highest price for half a day was 876.3 yuan, and the lowest price was 867 yuan, with a range of 9.3 yuan. The result was a rise of 4.2 yuan compared to the previous close (adding the premium of 6 yuan paid by the swap longs).</p>
<p>The disclosed price was 889 yuan, as the HSBC bank's US dollar quote remained unchanged at 27 yuan. According to the closing price, the price was about 14 yuan short, which was about 2 yuan weaker than the previous close. The ledger price for this month was 886 yuan, for September 881 yuan, and for October 875 yuan. The morning water replenishment was 886 yuan. The price of raw silver remained at 180 yuan plus, and the market was still supplied by the Tianjin gang. The price started at 178 yuan plus and rose to 185 yuan plus, which was paid by fellow merchants, totaling about a thousand taels. The initial price for the September-October swap was 6.5 yuan, which Ruikang, Hengchang, Yong and others paid out. Qianchangxiang and Hengxing paid in, but as Qianchangxiang worked hard to swap out, the Dalian gang and Yuanxingyong and others paid in again, and Dadecheng and others paid out, and prices retreated to 6.15 yuan and 6.23 yuan. Yuanmao paid only 6 yuan to Yongfeng, but only 7 contracts were traded. 763 August contracts remained.</p>
<p>The market transactions were still active, and short covering was strong. In summary, Hengxing, Chunyuanyong (selling more than a thousand contracts after the close), Wanxing, Dadecheng, Fuyu, Shunmao, Yuanmao, Yicheng and others all sold. Shunli, Ruikang, Qianchangxiang, Hongli, Yuanmaoyonghengyu, Zhaofengchang, Zhifengyong and others all advanced. The Dalian gang advanced over 500 and sold over 800 contracts. Shunli made over a thousand deals in total, netting 168 contracts. The Guang gang Hengxing slightly sold over 200 contracts. There are still over 2,600 September contracts that have not been properly swapped. Yifengyong and Shunli still held a majority of the long positions, while Dachangxiang, Fuchang, Hengyu, Yuanyida, Yongda, Dadecheng, Daxingyong and others held the short positions. The total number of contracts was still 3,836. There were 19,859 new October contracts in total.</p>

HSBC quoted the pound up by 0.125, while the US dollar remained unchanged. At the time of disclosure, the situation hovered.

<h3>The Bleak Scene of the Silver and Money Industry</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the overnight interest rate was still 5%. There were absolutely no fluctuations in the morning or afternoon markets. Even adding water to the flat rate did not open a price, and everything was done at the flat rate. The transaction volume for overnight bills increased by over 4.3 million in the morning, with new transactions of 1.23 million. The transaction volume for the afternoon market was 300,000. The transaction volume in the Small General Association was 700,000. Although the bank clearings were slightly better than the previous day, the situation was still very bleak. Foreign banks cleared over 1.4 million in bill payments, 2.4 million in foreign currency, and cleared over 3.78 million in silver and 3.1 million in foreign currency from various goods exchange deposits.

Over 39,200 strings of transactions were made, totaling 12,400 yuan in value.</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Finances in June</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of the month, commercial markets in various regions have been sluggish, and the number of merchants coming to Shanghai to purchase silver dollars has been limited. In the first two weeks of this month, an average of only 100,000 to 200,000 silver dollars were shipped from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces daily, and only 200,000 to 300,000 silver dollars from the Yangtze River region. Such scarce circulation is rarely seen. Furthermore, the Yangtze River region has been hit by floods, causing widespread panic. Merchants have telegraphed to halt the shipment of goods, resulting in a decline in business. The outflow of silver dollars is stagnant, making it difficult for native bank drafts to rally. Although the end of the month marks the semi-annual settlement period, silver and money houses are receiving more payments, but in reality, most of these are foreign exchange settlements, such as payments for imported goods and documentary bills, telegraphic transfers, etc. There are very few transactions in domestic trade, highlighting the sluggishness of the market.</p>
<p>The trend of native bank drafts remained stable throughout the month, with daily rates fluctuating by only a few points. Only on two days did they exceed one dime. Overall, the financial market experienced frequent turmoil in the price of gold, with sharp declines. The exchange rate was 191.54, a decrease of 11.07 compared to the previous month. The price of silver bars fluctuated greatly, but returned to normal at the end of the month, with an exchange rate of 66.5, an increase of 0.38 compared to the previous month. Foreign exchange rates for British, American, French, and Japanese currencies showed mixed fortunes. The British pound was stable, while the American dollar declined. The overall index was 1502, a decrease of 5.2 compared to the previous month. Native bank drafts remained sluggish as usual, showing signs of weakness. The average price for the month was 7.2 cents, a strong increase of 6.7 cents compared to the previous month. Small silver coins from Jiangsu and Guangdong both showed weakness. The exchange rate excluding seasonal factors was 98.8, the same as the previous month. Copper coins remained stable, with minimal fluctuations. The exchange rate excluding seasonal factors was 120.5, an increase of 1.0 compared to the previous month. The exchange rates for gold, silver bars, foreign exchange, domestic exchange, native bank drafts, small silver coins, and copper coins for this month are listed below:</p>

<p>Securities</p>
<h3>Government Bonds</h3>
<p>Only Straddle and Short Covering Trades</p>
<p>All Rose Between 10-20 Cents to 50-60 Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange still showed little activity. The trend was slightly stronger, with very few large-scale transactions. The market was mainly dominated by straddle trades by retail investors and some short covering. Northern merchants were slightly active, but there were no special circumstances. The market opened steadily in the morning. The reduction of troops turned from low to high, which gradually strengthened investor confidence. Retail investors engaged in straddle trades and short covering, with more short-selling straddles. As a result, the morning session rebounded by 10-40 cents. The closing situation was largely the same, with active straddle trading. Market prices continued to rise by 10-30 cents. The market results showed increases ranging from 10-20 cents to 50-60 cents. Due to the large number of outstanding positions, the future trend is expected to be volatile.</p>
<p>The total transaction volume was 5,639,000 yuan, including 4,000 yuan in spot transactions. Futures contracts included 2,065,000 yuan in consolidated salt tax bonds, 560,000 yuan in troop reduction bonds, 510,000 yuan in 1921 customs bonds, 735,000 yuan in 20-year customs bonds, 600,000 yuan in 1927 bonds, and over 400,000 yuan each in gold short-term bonds and consolidated bonds. The remaining transactions ranged from 10,000 to over 200,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Strong Then Weak</h3>
<p>According to a report from the New Feng Foreign Firm, the New York stock market opened strong on Tuesday (the 15th), but later weakened due to a lack of buyers. The result was almost no change. The total trading volume for the day was only 910,000 shares. Chicago wheat prices were temporarily on hold as the exchange will eliminate the minimum price limit from tomorrow. The market situation tomorrow may continue to weaken. The exchange authorities have also increased the wheat margin from one cent to five cents. American cotton prices continued to fall due to good harvest reports and hedging sales. The government is currently working on a recovery plan and will not engage in currency inflation for the time being, so there are very few buyers. The silver market is very sluggish. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>
<p>|                          | Closing Price | Change from Previous Day |</p>
<p>| :----------------------- | :------------ | :--------------------- |</p>
<p>| 30 Industrial Stocks     | 96.63         | Up 0.10              |</p>
<p>| 20 Railroad Stocks       | 48.58         | No Change            |</p>
<p>| 20 Utility Stocks        | 30.59         | Down 0.19            |</p>
<p>| 40 Bonds                 | 87.92         | Down 0.06            |</p>
<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<h3>Standard Yarn Rallies After Consecutive Declines</h3>
<p>Yarn prices rose slightly as consecutive declines over several days prompted profit-taking short covering. However, only 400 packages were purchased by spot buyers, while the yarn inventory in warehouses remains at 36,000-37,000 packages. Manufacturers are increasingly hedging forward standard yarn sales.</p>
<p>(Yarn Prices Rebound 30-80 Cents)</p>
<p>The pre-market opening for standard yarn was flat due to the consecutive declines in American cotton prices. However, some traders engaged in short covering opportunistically, causing the market to rebound by 10, 20, 30, or 40 cents. The afternoon session remained strong, with prices rising another 30-40 cents across all months. The total trading volume for the day was 46,900 bales.

<h3>Cotton Bulls Increase Positions This Month</h3>
<p>The cotton market initially fell and then rose. Although American cotton prices fell, the local cotton market was strong because the bulls continued to increase their positions this month. However, long-term prospects are uncertain due to favorable weather, early market entry of new cotton from various regions, and the closure of many yarn factories, resulting in sluggish sales. As a result, many traders are hedging sales in Shanghai. The market price of Ningbo Yaohua cotton is falling, and factory inventories are sluggish.</p>
<p>(Cotton Prices Rebound 75 Cents This Month)</p>
<p>The pre-market opening for standard cotton fell due to unfavorable external cotton prices. Later, short covering pushed prices up by 5 points to 1.5 dimes across all months, with the current month rising by 4.5 dimes. In the afternoon, the current month rose another 3 dimes, and long-term prices rose by 1 dime. The total trading volume for the day was 138,700 dan. Sales included 5,800 dan from Ruidai, 2,100 dan from Yuanda, 5,200 dan from Chunji, 3,100 dan from Yuande, 4,400 dan from Yuchang, 3,200 dan from Renfeng, 3,000 dan from Changhe, and 2,600 dan from Changfeng. Purchases included 4,100 dan from Chunji, 7,300 dan from Hengde, 3,500 dan from Renfeng, 2,700 dan from Jifeng, and 2,300 dan from Daji. The closing prices are as follows:</p>

<p>| Nov   | 41.65         | Up 05  | 166,400   |</p>
<p>(New Cotton Trading Gradually Picking Up)</p>
<p>Spot cotton business is gradually picking up with new cotton trading, but prices are very low. New fire-machine cotton is at 38.25. Shenxin Factory purchased 20,000 bales. Newly sent Tai Cang cotton is at 59.00 with another 1,000 bales. Also</p>
<h3>American Cotton Re-enters the 9-Cent Range</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market fell due to good harvests and hedging sales in the South. Spot prices fell by 15 points per pound, while futures prices fell by 15 to 21 points per pound. Liverpool cotton spot prices fell by 5 points, and futures prices fell by 5-6 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 6 points. The Bombay cotton market initially fell along with American cotton, but later rebounded due to short covering. As a result, Pingal rose by 2.5 annas, Omlar rose by 1.5 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell by 0.75 annas. The original telegram is recorded below (dated the 15th):</p>

<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>Wheat Futures Show a Slight Bullish Trend Due to Short Covering</p>
<p>8,500 Bags of Wheat Open Flat to Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the afternoon opening of wheat futures, there was generally a slight bullish trend. The quoted price for foreign wheat, Canadian, rebounded by about 50-60 cents. There was no market in Chicago. After the opening, investor confidence was still flat. However, a certain grain company heavily covered its short positions, totaling 50-60 cars in the front and back sessions. There were no large new hedging accounts in the market, so the opening prices of each contract were raised. In the afternoon, only eight or ninety transactions were active. The November and December contracts did not even open. Considering the current sluggishness of flour sales, the subsequent trend is unlikely to be bullish. As a result, the current month remained unchanged, September was up by 2 points, October was up by 3 points, and November to January remained unchanged. The spot wheat market remained flat to weak. Jiangyan wheat opened at 3.70 yuan, secondary at 64 cents; Yangzhou wheat at 3.52 yuan, secondary at 43 cents; Qingjiang wheat at 3.78 yuan, secondary at 73 cents; Shiying wheat at 3.50 yuan, secondary at 40 cents; Yaowan wheat at 3.77 yuan, secondary at 50 cents; Gaoyou wheat at 3.73 yuan, and Liuhe wheat at 3.50 yuan, secondary at 46 cents; Dongtai wheat at 3.70 yuan, with a total of 8,500 bags opened.</p>
<h3>Factories Again Hedge Forward Flour</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the morning and afternoon openings of the flour market, the prices of each month were generally flat to weak. The price of foreign wheat, Chicago, remained stagnant, and Canadian wheat rebounded by 50-60 cents. As for the trend of near-term and long-term contracts, those outside the industry have paid little attention to the current month. The various factories have been covering their own positions because the current asking prices for spot goods on the street are lower than the standard, so customers are naturally reluctant to purchase, resulting in a sluggish market. For the long-term contracts, there is little outside buying interest, and the factories have again been hedging sales, showing slight weakness. Considering the current sluggish sales, the future prospects are likely to remain sluggish. As a result, the current month remained unchanged, September was down by 2.5 li, October and November were down by 7.5 li, and December and January were unchanged.</p>
<h3>Sparse Arrival of Heshia Rice, Supply Tight</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai)</p>
<p>Only about ten sources, retail and wholesale appetites remained similar to before. The situation was relatively tight, mainly due to the limited arrival of goods, especially the Nanhai thick rice and various kinds of thin rice. The market situation was also most favorable for these two types of goods. Chang Bang, Su Tong Bang white glutinous rice, and Du Yang pointed rice remained flat. However, even for the popular items, the outlets were limited, and it was difficult to be overly optimistic. The exchange rice supply and demand were balanced, and the prices remained firm. There was still no change in Dongxin rice. Statistics show that the total supply from the above gongbang packages was only about 700-800 packages.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai)</p>
<p>Over thirty sources of various types of rice arrived. Sales in various markets were flat. The price of white glutinous rice from the Northern Gang was slightly higher, while thin glutinous rice and yang tip rice were firm with secondary grades remaining flat. Du Bu pointed new and old customer tip rice prices were stable. Early rice and exchange rice were slightly sluggish. There was little change in Dongxin rice.</p>
<h3>Dalian Soybeans Unusually Sluggish</h3>
<p>Dalian soybeans have a significant advantage in the local market. The volume of trading surpasses that of other varieties, so price fluctuations for those soybeans are an industry barometer. This year, however, the freight charges from Dalian are especially high, supplies are scarce, with inventories only around 200 trucks, and demand is low, resulting in a stagnant market. Currently, the Dalian market is also seeing a sharp drop in prices, making it even more difficult to sell in the Shanghai market. Yesterday, only Dayou Oil Factory showed interest, buying 23 trucks at a price of 4.82 yuan. The future trend is still difficult to determine.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>The Current Situation of Autumn Silkworms in Zhejiang is Not Good</p>
<p>New Disease Discovered in Xinchang Silkworms. In Xinchang, Huangze, and other places, the silkworm eggs this year were very strong. They have now entered the third molt and are about to wake up. However, for the past ten days, the weather has been unfavorable, with continuous rain. The silkworms have been found to have diseases, with symptoms of diarrhea, yellowing, vomiting black liquid, and even rotting and dying. The current situation is not good.</p>
<p>Japanese Rayon Sales Increasing Steadily. The sales of Japanese rayon are increasing steadily. Sales to the Changjiang and Yanqing gangs are the strongest, with monthly sales of 2,000-2,000 volumes. As a result, it is difficult to expect progress in the sales of European and American rayon.</p>
<p>European Sales of Chinese Silk Sluggish. The overseas raw silk market is in a slump, and the turnover of Chinese silk is limited. Prices are also unusually low, causing Chinese silk merchants to continue selling off their stocks. The market is sluggish. Yesterday, only Renji and others purchased 40 packages of white silk and 10 packages of yellow silk, with prices remaining flat.</p>
<h3>Sales of Zhenmei Tea from Wuxi and Zhejiang Move Slightly in Europe</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market in the foreign concessions saw activity in Zhenmei green tea from Wuyuan and the Northeast. Jardine Matheson, Tianyu, Tianxiang, and Yongxing, the various foreign firms, all began to purchase, and transactions were fairly lively. Top-quality hand-picked tea opened at 213 yuan, and ordinary batch goods sold for 135 yuan, with little change from before. However, the sales of mid- and low-grade Zhenmei tea were slightly more active, but prices were low. Needle-shaped tea and other items remained firm. Sales of Road Zhuang Ping Shui tea also increased slightly, but market prices fell by 23 to 45 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>The Sugar Market Shows Slight Weakness</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was slow to increase in value, but after a gradual rise in prices, the trend has turned stable. The Public Association priced grade 24 coarse white granulated sugar at 21.15 yuan, the original price; grade 20 medium white granulated sugar at 20.6 yuan, Dutch red high-grade sugar at 16.7 yuan, and general grade sugar at 16.45 yuan. There were no transactions, indicating that it may be difficult for the market to continue rising. Taikoo sugar B was still priced at 21.6 yuan. China and Guohua cotton white sugar were each down by 5 points, top grade at 20.4 yuan, grade 1 at 20.2 yuan, grade 2 at 20.0 yuan, grade 3 at 19.8 yuan, and grade 4 at 19.6 yuan. Grade 3 rock sugar was up by 1 dime at 22.8 yuan, and the rest remained unchanged. Jian Gang's Five Blessings standard white rock sugar continued to open slightly, with the price remaining at 17.8 yuan.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods</h3>
<p>Xiamen Soft Cakes Open at 28 Yuan</p>
<p>Orchid Seeds in Short Supply</p>
<p>The Xiamen soft cakes that arrived the day before yesterday were on display yesterday. The goods were of good quality and immediately opened at a price of 28 yuan. There were also a dozen boxes of small tangerine cakes, which were being negotiated, but no transactions were made. The market situation was firm.</p>
<p>The arrival of orchid seeds this week was limited, and high-quality goods were especially scarce. Demand was for good-quality goods, so ordinary grades had difficulty fetching good prices. Currently, high-quality goods with coarse grains, all-yellow color, and dry texture are out of stock.</p>

<h3>The Word "Yuan" Used in the Bean and Rice Industry</h3>
<p>By Ming</p>
<p>The word "yuan" is used more frequently in the local bean industry than in any other. The most famous is the "98 gui yuan." The word "yuan" is a short form of the characters "yuan bao" (silver ingot). The word "gui" has the same meaning as "gui" in "er gui er chu" (divide by two and remove), etc., meaning "divide and remove." In other words, the weight and fineness of the silver ingot are divided by "98." Later, for ease of use, the two characters "98" were omitted, and it was simply called "gui yuan." Those who don't know may not understand what the two characters "gui yuan" mean, and they don't know that the character "gui" is originally connected to the two characters 98 and is used as a verb; the character "yuan" is a noun. In addition, there are also the following types of goods:</p>
<p>Yuan beans refer to soybeans from the three northeastern provinces. Because the majority of soybeans produced in the three northeastern provinces are large-seeded and round, unlike the flat, long round beans produced elsewhere.</p>
<p>Yuan rice refers to glutinous rice among edible rice, also called "bian yuan." Because its seeds turn into long, round rods, unlike the long, flat rice from other places.</p>
<p>Yuan sesame is a type of black sesame seed. This is named from its color, which is different from the above two types.</p>
<p>Yuan mai (naked barley) has a shape similar to wheat, but the seeds are round and smooth, hence the name. However, when we see yuan mai, we only feel that its two ends are sharp, and it does not look like the round rice of qi yuan. Perhaps there are other reasons!</p>

<h3>The So-Called "Shanghai Coffin Corpse Case"!</h3>
<p>— Jian</p>
<p>Recently, the local newspapers have all published the so-called "Shanghai coffin corpse case" with large headlines, occupying a long space. Its importance can be imagined.</p>
<p>The Japanese authorities, in particular, have been very active; since the discovery, they have gone through several rounds of autopsies, and even disturbed the police authorities of the British and French concessions. It is said that "it is unprecedented in Shanghai for an international search to be fully mobilized due to a single body." The great significance of the case is self-evident.</p>
<p>Just as the Japanese Consulate police determined that the female corpse was Chen Qiaoying, suddenly a "beautiful" Chen Qiaoying jumped out, personally running to the Japanese Consulate to prove in "extremely fluent Japanese" that she was still alive, and incidentally stating that she only had three lovers, and not more than forty; fearing that the opportunity would be lost, she took the opportunity to take a photo with Inspector Sato (?) to commemorate the event. This behind-the-scenes comedy was even more colorful and moving.</p>
<p>But what exactly is the content of this case? According to reports, it has been "brought to light." If it is true, it is nothing more than this: "The murderer... a Portuguese rogue teenager, the victim... a beautiful Cantonese woman... love... break-up... moving the body to Japan."</p>
<p>The plot in the case is so ordinary and unremarkable! The characters in the case are so vulgar and despicable! How is it worth such a fuss and commotion?</p>
<p>However, the Japanese police are busy and happy. What are they doing? I think it is nothing more than playing an old trick, using this as a pretext to once again conduct a propaganda campaign, showing that the police of the Great Japanese Empire are highly skilled and will not ignore human life.</p>
<p>Let us shift our vision and make a deeper observation:</p>
<p>From the "September 18th Incident" and the "January 28th Incident" to the "Tanggu Truce," countless Chinese compatriots were innocently arrested and arbitrarily killed by the Japanese army, in cases known as disappearances. The number of Korean revolutionaries who were secretly arrested and killed by the Japanese each year due to political movements is also countless. In recent years, the rulers of the Japanese capitalist class, the military cliques and the zaibatsu have adopted the fascist ideology that was all the rage, destroying revolutionary youth and assassinating leftist scholars, which has become an open secret.</p>
<p>The Japanese police authorities have never made an effort to investigate these inhumane trumped-up charges and injustices to reveal the truth to the world? Absolutely not! Only this "coffin corpse case" is particularly vigorous. It is really observing the slightest detail while failing to see a cartload of firewood, and reversing the importance. Is this not clearly throwing up a smoke screen?</p>
<p>Think about it: Compared with these many unsolved cases, this "coffin corpse case" is simply "a drop in the bucket," what is it worth? Moreover, many of the victims possess outstanding talent, extraordinary thoughts, and a spirit of sacrifice, which cannot be compared with a romantic woman! Why treat them so differently?</p>
<p>Taking a step back: Even if this case is cleared, it can only impose imprisonment or the death penalty on the murderer, which only increases personal suffering or kills one more person; it can never bring the dead back to life, or turn a "rogue teenager" into an ambitious person; nor can it absolutely guarantee the third case of this kind. The third case, the... case will not continue to happen! The "coffin corpse case" is just a tiny bacterium among the countless ones that are born from corruption under the current social system.</p>
<h3>"Nude Chanting"</h3>
<p>— Baibi</p>
<p>The Shen Bao's Xuzhou special dispatch on the 8th stated: "Maritime News. A secret gathering was discovered in Baitoushi Village, Ganyu, where men and women gathered in a room at night, chanting scriptures naked. The actions were obscene. Many ignorant men and women joined the group."</p>
<p>This can probably be considered a "very wonderful anecdote"! It is worth pondering. But unfortunately, I no longer have the interest to study "how the men and women gathered, how they stripped naked, how they chanted scriptures, and how they were obscene." It is really a great pity!</p>
<p>But I have associations, associations with "legitimacy." One is: "Nude with Chanting,"</p>
<p>The men and women members sunbathe naked, chanting the mantra "form is emptiness, emptiness is form." So that the gentlemen who oppose obscene nude movements will not oppose it entirely, at least "half of the whole" will not oppose the holy "chanting movement." Doesn't this break up the ranks of the opposition? The "savages" who advocate nude movements can speculate on this.</p>
<p>The second is: "Nude Opposition to Scripture Reading" In the classroom, male and female students, everyone undresses and, at the same time, reads the scriptures with a unique tone. A clear opposition to "reading scriptures" cannot be as powerful as this humorous act. Why not give it a try, young people of the South!</p>
<p>Talking about this issue here, I feel that my associations are too "unruly." "Silence is golden"!</p>
<h3>Five Minutes of Change</h3>
<p>— Jianyin</p>
<p>She was a poor and weak young woman, and her husband had fallen ill. The family's daily life depended on her husband selling fruit. Under the heat, her husband was defeated!</p>
<p>"Alas! The medical expenses don't matter, but we need to eat!" Her husband said.</p>
<p>"I'll go to the neighbors and borrow some money and see..." "..." He nodded, indicating that this was the only way.</p>
<p>She stood in front of him again, with a miserable expression, saying:</p>
<p>"Everyone is complaining, and I can't even borrow a penny!"</p>
<p>"Alas! This..."</p>
<p>"I thought I'd take a few clothes to the pawnshop and see!"</p>
<p>"But there are no good clothes?"</p>
<p>"The few qipaos I brought when I was a new bride are still fresh,"</p>
<p>"Try it, and redeem them as soon as I get better."</p>
<p>She took out the old-fashioned qipaos from four years ago, painfully wrapped three of them in newspaper, and hurried out of the door, timidly sneaking into the pawnshop. With trembling hands, she handed over the paper package, and she immediately thought to herself:</p>
<p>"Now I can get one or two silver dollars," "You're pawning this kind of old goods? It's a joke!" The clerk looked at her with an iron face, pushed the paper package away, and went inside.</p>
<p>"Even if you pawn it for a few cents, it's okay!"</p>
<p>"..." There was no answer inside.</p>
<p>She spent less than five minutes going into the pawnshop and leaving the pawnshop. She was stimulated, and then her nerves went haywire. She sang songs and walked forward, and many idlers followed her to watch the fun. She walked into her own home and couldn't recognize her husband; but her husband saw that there were still deep tear stains hanging in the corners of her eyes.</p>
<p>A few days later, he was carried into the ×× Hospital, while she was in the mental hospital.</p>
