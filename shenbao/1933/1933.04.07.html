<p>日軍旣不得逞於喜峯口。乃轉其兇鋒。利用九門之便。襲擊石門。以少數敵騎撲海陽鎭。現時之戰。殆爲前線步哨接觸。而尚非眞面目之爭戰也蓋其駐在錦州之步兵第四旅團。未嘗正式參戰。僅以獨立守備第三大隊長岩田文男統率之千餘人爲主力。爲側面之襲擊。加以僞國烏合之衆作擾亂之舉。在我方觀察。或亦以其爲非正式挑戰。故取純粹的防守姿勢。敵來則應戰。敵去亦不窮追。然而敵方則正可因此進退自如。伸縮隨意。我反處於被動地位矣。　　日本處世界經濟恐慌狂潮之際。外與列國利害衝突。内因國民饑寒交迫。惶擾不寗。由其近半年來稅收之減少。政治社會。均感不安。足徵其内部動搖。政治的社會的經濟的癌腫。日漸增大。設使不故意惹起外患者則當前之政爭。即可陷日本於不可收拾之地位。故必一力侵略。而又不肯冒戰爭之名。自九一八事變以還。皆口道和平。倡爲地方解决之謬說。一則彌縫彼自身之矛盾。唤起其所謂共赴﹁國難。﹂再則借此緩和我國同仇敵愾之心。以遂其逐步蠶食之詭謀。此其有利者一也。設使發動正式戰爭。中國雖弱。而養兵二百餘萬。半數精兵亦可立集。人民窮困巳成素習。耐苦茹辛之精神。堪稱當世第一。以整個的民族。與日本軍國主義爲生死之搏戰。日本雖兇横。亦必無倖勝之理。即使曠日持久。我國失陷若干地盤。但若能繼續作戰。最後勝利。必歸我國。是以日本利於以小部隊作戰。運用聲東擊西之舊法。處處爲各個擊破之秘計。此其分部侵蝕之有利者二也。</p>
<p>日本且審知我國内部欠充實。人民少訓練。官吏多貪墨。而尤以邊疆文化落後諸省爲尤甚。彼更得利用傀儡以蠱惑人心。遂其野望。於是在内蒙東部一帶。早伏線索。買收一部分不肖王公。作皮爪牙。雖有多數蒙人。傾心内向。但與本部相距遙遠。亦無能爲也。現彼方鐵騎四出。表面高倡不越長城不過灤河者。徒以對英法美各國之向背。觀察未淸。稍作滯疑而已。然將伸其魔手於内蒙。勢已至明。無庸贅述。矧熱河之役。依附僞國諸人所部。無處消納。其最善處置之道。莫如令彼輩爲先遣隊。與我軍衝突。戰而敗殁。所損失正爲日帝國所欲消除而難於下手者。假我國之手以除之。同時使我國軍隊。亦受相當損失。戰而勝。則被魚肉者爲我國人民。被蹂躪者爲我國領。土日本乃坐收大利。　　當此時也。我國萬不宜再事遷延。尤不能放鬆一步。欲保持平津。固守華北。必以全力維護多倫。以多倫爲入蒙古之要道。亦平綏路之前衛。西北諸省之屏藩也。至於交通不便。道路崎嶇。則敵我共之。且正可以利用此不便。而運用我拙劣之迂廻。以擊敵之所短。况彼日軍遠道來攻。拿頗崙遠征俄羅斯。足爲殷鑑。而萬里沙漠。僅有水草。是天然之堅壁淸野。足陷敵人於絶地。故我國民宜速奮起。拚最後之一滴血。以最後之一粒子彈。以北保多倫。東護灤東。則尚不難挽轉現時危難之局。開未來之新生機也。</p>

<h3 id="c75">日本戰爭總動員之準備（三續） <a href="#c75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>九工業動員與平時的調查關於工業動員的調查、這由軍需調查會或資源調查會來負責、對於許多工廠、計劃着戰時的狀態、從平時就命令其舉行調查的、一旦戰爭爆發的時候、第一要使這些工廠立刻就從事於軍需品的製造的、但是在這裏必須注意的就是日本的産業多徧重於紡績工業和食料品工業、而關於軍需工業所必須的金屬工業、機械器具工業、和化學工業、比較的不振作、這是美中不足的、</p>
<p>關於工業動員的進行法、如果把歐洲大戰以來提出於議會的案件來考察、我們似乎可以把牠來分做兩個系統、一個是政府本身不來管理軍需品製造工廠、而委之於團體或公司、另一個就是政府親自管理工廠的方式、前者爲大戰時德國所採用的方式、後者爲戰後法國及意國所欲進行或正在進行的方式、日本的工業動員法也用政府的權限來管理、使用、或收用工廠、所以屬於後者、</p>
<p>輸送機關的徵發、那是要根據微發令來動作的、輸送機關的徵發全部並不單是爲工業動員的、如果是軍隊用、就要由軍來徵發、由軍來使用、但是有一種保護汽車、應該要按照軍用保護汽車法、拿出一定的補償金來收用、</p>
<p>在德國時常聽到的、伯林公園的椅子、每逢戰事發生就立刻不翼而飛、終被搬入貨車中當兵卒輸送時之用、因爲事前就有預算、所以椅子的長短也早巳决定了的、並且爲了收容戰傷者、當時火車中的臥室不夠用、也用了長凳子來代替、這也是事前計劃的、像這樣、要進行總動員、應該着眼於平時施設的、</p>
<p>現在國防婦人會也逐漸盛行於全國了、會員每人平時都掛着一隻金戒指來當做會員的記號、一旦到了國家非常時期的時候、都要脫下金戒指來獻納給國家、紙幣每因時價而昇降無常、但是金戒指却是穏固的、這樣的計劃現在正在進行着、所以日本婦人每人各帶着金戒指、而一旦有戰事的時候、立刻就可以增加了幾萬萬元的了、這現在鼓吹得很有起色、現在關西方面、敎員和學生所穿的外套以至於衣服帽子、都和軍隊所穿的質料相似、這就是京都一帶學校的制服、並且也擴充到了大阪方面、這就是從國家總動員的見地來進行的、在大阪被服廠、就可以看到有被服協會的組織、在這裏面當然有軍人參加着、毛織業者、染料業者都參加着、其顯然的成績就是使民間不斷的製出了灰色質料的被服、這些事縱使不是爲總動員而進行、然而其结果也是屬於總動員的平時施設之一種、一旦戰事發生的時候、立刻就有用處、就算是成了被服資源的培養、把這個、從總動員的見地來觀察、可以說被服協會進行着總動員的工作、這樣的事體自九一八事變以來、似乎到處都可以看到的、</p>
<p>這樣的事體如果在動員計劃中積極的進行、這就是國民一致對於國防力向上的帮助、也是國家總動員的平時施設之一種、</p>
<p>還有罐頭的形狀、也成陸軍用的一定大小了、北海道方面的某罐頭業者、似乎巳經完全把牠改成軍用式了、</p>
<p>十日本無自給自足的國力講到日本要能有自給自足的國力、必須經過相當的時間、所以在現在日本的狀態、一旦戰事開始、並没有立刻就有自給自足的能力、現在正在進行着這種自給自足的途徑、如果目前戰事一開始、我們立刻感到不足的第一就是石油、我們雖然也有滿洲樺太的油田也大可以開發、其他關於國防重要資源、也可以仰給於滿洲方面、但是並不能一開掘立刻就可以得到油的、所以現在的日本國内無論如何是不能自足的、最感到不足的就是石油、要使石油在國内能得到某程度的自給應該如何辦法、這是一個大問題、現在石油從美國輸入的很不少、如果能像平時從美國不斷的輸入、那就不成問題了、如果一旦遭遇着不得仰給於美國的時候、自非另外設想不可的、此外也可以仰給於南洋方面或俄國的油、或設法從歐洲方面輸入、而其實行的可能性祇有待於我們的周密計劃和平時的準備、否則在事實上是很困難的、</p>
<p>十一日本的戰費是否充分但是一方面最堪憂慮的、就是運用資源的金錢的問題、這是關於將來的戰爭、一年應需要多少金錢的問題、一年總須要五六十萬萬之數、倘如繼續兩年、必須百十萬萬、這單是陸軍所需的數目、國家方面必須需要更多、但是關於戰費的問題、從過去的戰爭看來、增稅祇不過是戰費的一部分而巳、戰費的主力當以公債及不换紙幣爲主、金錢的問題倘如打勝了就不成問題、倘如打敗了、就不得了、德國打敗、一兆馬克更暴落到五角錢、日本如果打敗仗、那就糟了、日本國民無論誰都以爲戰事一起、困難的就是資源的問題、並且以爲困難的尤其是金錢、</p>

<p>日人對我作戰、完全利賴現代武器、其實日兵胆量極小、最怕我軍大刀、彼謂如被大刀砍殺、來世不能轉生人類、故每人均佩帶神符二三件、以保不死、或死後再生人類、其怯其愚、足資證明日本軍閥之罪大惡極、其神符文曰﹁　户神社（武運常久）御守﹂、又﹁天津日高彦火歹出見命御守﹂、前者之﹁神﹂字上及後者之﹁高彦﹂兩字間、均蓋有紅印、字跡不明、符上之字、亦極工整﹂、（四月二日）</p>

<p>宋子文談</p>
<p>本人辭中央總裁係積極負責</p>
<p>財部統籌全局致力經濟建設</p>
<p>中央銀行基礎已固益可發展</p>
<p>丨昨晨宋訪孔勸任總裁孔堅辭丨</p>
<p>行政院副院長兼財長宋子文氏、前晚夜車離京、於昨晨抵滬、即返西愛咸斯路私邸、並至駐滬辦事處辦公、九時許招商局總經理劉鴻生·航空學校校長毛邦初、相繼往訪、十一時、宋氏訪孔祥熙、敦勸出任中央銀行總裁、共負艱鉅、孔婉辭、並對記者表示用非其才、决不就、兹分誌兩氏談話如下、</p>
<h3 id="c98">宋氏談話 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>積極負責日來外間謠傳、有因負責軍事者、不願對日軍事擴大、故宋氏表示消極、有倦勤之意、新聲社記者特於上午十時、造謁宋氏、詢以究竟、宋氏答謂、絶無其事、此謠傳之起源、當爲余辭中央銀行總裁所附會、實則余辭中央銀行總裁、正所以積極負責、其理由有三、</p>
<p>基礎已固中央銀行設立之初、因組織草創、始基未固、不得不由財長兼任、數年以來、歷經内亂·水災·外侮·及銀價低落等重大險惡之環境、而中央銀行、均兀然未稍受影響、今基礎巳甚鞏固、業務發展、已無庸再由余兼任矣、此其一、　　統顧全部且余爲財政部長、在職責上對全國金融經濟之維護調劑、應一體兼顧、身兼中央總裁、反有偏顧一行、忽略全體之嫌、殊有不便、此其二、</p>
<p>經濟建設今日財政上最要者、固爲規劃戰時軍費、然對於經濟建設、亦不能忽視、蓋經濟爲立國大本、我國近狀、極幼稚落後、倘於此不急起直追、而僅作洽標之圖、則必有山窮水盡之一日、本人今後擬致力於此、而中行組織、日趨複雜、勢難兼顧、此其三、</p>
<p>一仍舊貫基此三由、故余辭去中央銀行總裁後、即由汪院長推請孔前部長繼任、中央銀行監事等、並無更變、一切政策、悉仍舊貫、今後財部對中央銀行、當然盡維護之全責、收指臂相使之效、專責有人、當益可發展也、</p>
<p>决不妥協至蔣委員長之赴南昌、因贛省共匪猖獗、不得不親自一行、决非放鬆華北戰事、謠傳有人主張妥協、實捕風捉影之談、余重言以申明之、政府中央、無一人肯作李鴻章也、其他政治問題、因余巳卸行政院職、不願表示、華北戰事、據海關消息、謂離秦皇島北五英里有戰事、</p>
<h3 id="c99">孔氏談話 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>表示不就孔祥熙晤宋部長後、出語中央社記者云、宋部長因事繁、辭去中央銀行總裁職務、中政會議决任命本人繼任、但本人尚未奉到正式命令、故尚無表示就否之可能、兹退一步而言、即或中央正式任命本人爲該行總裁、本人亦决表示不就、蓋中央銀行爲國家銀行、規模宏大、非有學識經騐如宋部長者、不克勝任、本人學識淺陋、素乏處理銀行之經騐、對此重大之國家金融機關、實覺不能勝任、至於本人前在任實業部長時、曾創辦國貨銀行、但國貨銀行、規模較小、處理容易、當與此不同者、謂當此國難、中國金融不景氣時代、凡屬國人、均應共赴艱鉅、但須知習工者不善種植、爲農者不善作賈、若欲勉任亦所不能、故本人表示不就、即此意也、云云、</p>

<p>現正由實業部分别研究</p>
<p>俟俄使到滬再正式磋商</p>
<p>中俄貿易問題、自中俄復交以後、實業部竭力主張國營、以免造成一方傾銷、兹據國際貿易局消息、關於中俄貿易問題、曾由雙方非正式交換意見、我方則絶對主張國營、俄方則反對此舉、且俄方經濟、賴輸出爲維持、故對於雙方貿易、提出要求、輸俄者貨欵不能現付、輸華者皆須現付、以致雙方相差甚遠、同時國際貿易局據茶商報告、華茶輸俄、向例須十五月付欵、致茶商限於財力、無法經營、而查我國對俄輸出品之大宗、祗有茶荳兩項、荳自東三省失陷後、其地位已隨之失去、茶因上述情形、在俄市塲、已盡爲日茶錫蘭茶所奪、故照此情形、祗有我爲他人市塲、而形成一國傾銷、雖中俄國交、現已恢復友善地位、但爲維持我國工商業計、非國營不足以、</p>
<p>調劑均等、故國營原則、業已經中政會議决、其辦法亦已由國際貿易局擬呈實業部採用、最關重要者、計有兩點、（一）輸出品以不妨碍我原料及民食需要爲原則、（二）輸入品以不妨碍我國固有之工業及小工業爲原則、並定方式三種、（一）組織中俄貿易公司、以專司其事、（二）由各銀行組織銀行團、以辦理進出口貨之欵項往來、（三）由國家銀行協助此事、此項辦法、現正由實業部分别研究、一俟俄使到滬、再行正式磋商云、</p>

<p>丨本埠劉思民君來信丨</p>
<p>記者先生，我讀了四月四日的讀者顧問，正在爲雄聲君納悶，並爲中國的整個社會納悶，今天看到讀者顧問的標題，說是﹁自由農塲尤懷臯先生來信答復本欄雄聲君﹂的討論，我高興得非常，心裏想，尤君一定可以給我們許多新的意見，但是一開首讀他的信，便我失望，尤君說：﹁久居城中的人，或要感到枯寂無聊的少趣，然而我覺得在國難臨頭的時節，眼見都市醉生夢死的一活，倒不如覓一個幽靜可愛的鄉村去另謀出路，憑我脂力所及，用十年的工夫，來建設一個意想中的新式的桃花源，﹂好一個﹁新式的桃花源﹂，好一個﹁意想中的桃花源﹂，我們尤先生旣然夢想着這釋﹁意想中的新式的桃花源﹂，爲什麽自己不去試一試，﹁用十年的工夫﹂去試一試，關起門來，做他的好夢，享他的淸福，卽使日本軍隊打了來，或是什麽地方的赤匪打了來，也不會光顧到他，因爲陶淵明的﹁桃花源﹂中的人﹁不知有漢，無論魏晋，﹂尤先生的﹁意想中的新式的桃花源﹂，一定是﹁不知有周秦，遑論中華民國，不知中華民國，遑論日本英美，﹂依我看來，桃花源旣如是地開心，還是勸尤先生先去試騐試騐，一來是這樣甘美而安樂的世外桃源，怎樣會議人去享受，二來是尤先生去絶不會像雄聲先生那樣爲難，﹁二百元﹂的借欵，在尤先生是不發生問題的，然而在雄聲先生便無處設法，（或許尤先生大發慈悲，借二百元給他，那又是一個問題，）因爲他是個﹁赤貧﹂的人，尤先生你鼓起勇氣罷，好好地去幹罷，至於日本帝國主義者，現在才佔領東北四省，一時還打不到我們江蘇來（？），江西的赤匪，一時也還共不到我們江蘇的産，就是打到了江蘇或是共到了江蘇，那你的﹁新式桃花源﹂，也一定能以﹁巍然獨存﹂，因爲牠﹁不知有周秦，遑論中華民國，不知有中華民國，遑論有日本，英美﹂呀，讀者大衆不要以爲我是在開玩笑，非也，非也，老實說罷，尤先生這種思想是目前中國資産階級對於現政治的一個眞切的反映，因爲中國資産階級在這個當口，進不能進，退不能退，乾脆地求和，固所願也，然而不能，至少是不好意思，眞正抵抗，全國動員來抵抗罷，又不敢，他的社會關係和運命决定了他，於是徘徊歧路，就一定有這種避世的幻想，幻想，幻想，至於尤先生所謂﹁先决條件﹂咧，其牠一切辦法咧，皆是從此幻想出發的枝葉問題，若果一條一條來討論，恐怕還要加一倍的篇幅，够了，够了，先生以爲何如，</p>
<p>再者，尤先生是﹁主張鄉村敎育救國的一個人﹂，所以他對於雄聲君不厭求詳地替他﹁運籌借箸﹂，可惜他不曉得現在的資本主義的社會是鄉村支配於城市，誰也逃不出這個公例，自然在另一進步的社會裏，卽社會主義的社會裏，是要打破這一公例，消滅城市與鄉村的對立，然而這絶不是現社會的勾當，美國的大農業與日本的比較小規模的農業，皆是資本主義社會的典型，然而牠們的農村破産，恐慌日甚，我要請問，難道牠們的鄉村敎育辦得不比我們十百倍的好麽，爲什麽也還在岌岌不可終日呢，因爲問題不在此，尤先生的鄉村敎育，至多也不過追踪美國，但是結果也一定無濟於他們的一百二十萬萬或五六十萬萬的債務的窮迫，還有一層，尤先生也是只知其一，不知其二，譬如，他說：﹁鄉村中的好處······人民誠實，没有城中的欺詐，﹂其實不然，城市的人不是整個人，上層分子，市僧，官僚，胸中只有勢利，眼中只有金錢，他們的舌劍腸冰，爾虞我詐，尤先生的批評是對的，然而，譬如上海罷，三百二十萬人中的大多數人（店員工人一部分的靑年學生）他們都還是誠實無欺的，尤先生的眼睛着了色，自然看不淸這一階層，而且，我想他的頭也許未曾轉到這一方面來，我們要提醒他一句，﹁回過頭來﹂，</p>
<p>記者按：記者想尤先生讀了劉君的信，一定還有高見可以答辯的，我們等着罷，不過記者在這兒要有一個聲明，我們對於讀者大衆的討論，有一個根本見解，就是由部分的問題，引到一般的問題，由枝葉問題引到根本的問題，雄聲君前信說要到鄉村去，而他的目的却又專在謀個人生活，所以記者答他道，﹁在這種情形之下，想回到農村去專爲謀生起見，那我們實在看不出什麽樂觀的前途，﹂這句話應重讀﹁專爲謀生起見﹂數字，言外之意可見，特爲讀者誦之，</p>

<p>— 張芷痕</p>
<p>有一處繹鎭，離城很遠，那處大小一切事，都由當地幾位鄉紳處理，絶不驚官動府。且說鎭上有一家人家；因爲有一件事，犯了本地各鄉紳的衆怒。各位鄉紳這一氣，非同兒戲，大家就在本鎭的議事廳，開了大會，大家議論紛紛，都說：非敎這家人家看着他們的顔色不可。結果：大家議定，敎這家人家把各處産業，交給他們代管，其中南村一帶的田地，就請住在靠近渾名呌做十三拳的叚　紳代爲管理，這家人家，正在失勢的時候，誰也不肯帮着他說話，不得不遵命交出。</p>
<p>過了好多年之後，這位叚鄉紳，却因爲另外一件事，同各位鄉紳閙起意見來，氣憤憤地向着各位鄉绅說：﹁以後本地公衆事件，諸位休來問我，我也不願再到議事廳裏去。﹂有人在旁邊對這位叚鄉绅說：﹁你旣然閉門不問本地公衆的事，那麽，以前請你代管的那家人家的南村田地，你應得把它退出來了。﹂叚鄉紳聽了這話，就現出十足道地的土棍式鄉紳的臭架子起來，把小瓜皮帽兒斜在頭頂上，把兩隻袖口兒高高地播起，一隻手指到這人的譣上，說：﹁南村的田地麽？那另是一個問題，老爺的一家，現在靠着它吃着呢，要我把它退出麽？休得做夢！﹂</p>
<p>哈哈！别人家的産業，不過是請他代管罷了，那知他却當着主産，霸佔不交，靠它吃着起來，這豈不是一個絶大的笑話？</p>
<p>日本燈人，現在退出國聯，但它對南洋德屬舊殖民地的委任統治，認爲是日本的生命綫，絶不肯交出。不知同那位霸佔産業的叚鄉绅有没有分别？</p>

<p>太平軍之據有蘇松太各地也，江蘇紳士，醵重金，雇洋商巨艦，由海道載李鴻章淮軍到上海。請兵專使爲錢鼎銘，太倉人，前湘撫錢寳琛之子，寳琛與曾國藩有交誼，故公推鼎銘入曾營請兵也。李鴻章被派來滬，鼎銘與俱。旣而與太平軍開仗，鴻章即邀鼎銘參觀，接觸漸近，太平軍所發槍子，聲虎在頂上飛過，鴻章兀坐不動，談笑自若。鼎銘遽失常態：鴻章笑謂之曰，槍子有眼珠的，他不妄傷人，調甫放心安坐可耳。調甫鼎銘字：蓋鴻章久歷行陣，習慣自然，練膽已到純熟時期。其云槍子有眼珠，不妄傷人，乃權術語，大約告其部屬，常用此言也。其後鼎銘屢隨鴻章督戰，膽漸大，以舉人積軍功，亦官巡撫。</p>
<p>蘇人朱永璜，以武進士入長江水師營，日習打靶，槍無虚發矣。回蘇隨某統領入太湖剿梟匪，在湖面接仗，所發槍無一命中，非過高越匪船，即太低不及船而放水。某統領謂爾尚無經騐，没有膽，心房跳則兩膀震動，瞄不準了。後屢接仗，漸漸膽壯，從前打靶時槍無虚發之長技，至是始得展。</p>

<h3 id="c176">特别證章 <a href="#c176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— 大聖</p>
<p>去年，我有一位朋友從德國留學回國，另一位朋友的德　夫人同行。這位德國女士來到中國還是第一次，當然絲毫不能理解中國這一大謎。他們到上海後，又同去南京，進城的時候，這位德國女士眼見每一個進城的人都必須受守門警士翻箱倒篋的檢查，只有我那位朋友不知是拿着什麽法寶向警士幌了一下，馬上得安然通行，並未受檢查的麻煩，她十分的鶩異，例問道：</p>
<p>﹁這是什麽緣故呢？﹂</p>
<p>﹁因爲我拿了一枚軍事機關的特别證章給警士看過，所以可免檢查。﹂我的朋友這樣解釋。﹁那末，有軍事機關的證章便可以不受任何檢查嗎？﹂</p>
<p>﹁在中國就是這樣。﹂</p>
<p>"WonderfullWonderfull"（奇怪）最後，這位德國女士還是這樣喃喃自語，表示十分的驚奇！</p>
<p>其實，這有什麽鶩奇呢？在中國，將爺們，爵爺們，降而至於警爺們，到處都是有﹁權﹂佔便宜的，﹁利﹂之所在者固不必說，卽小而至於乘車坐船，以至看戲之類，亦無不佔便宜。其理由很簡單：古聖先賢不是說遇嗎？﹁治人者食於人，﹂食於人的意思，就是，有一羣人天然該佔便宜，而另一羣人則天然該被占便宜，這其間并一點也用不着Wonderful！</p>
<p>古語又曾說：﹁王子犯法與庶民同罪﹂，當然這只是騙人的話。本來，﹁法﹂是什麽，也就很難說，就是王子而眞有﹁罪﹂，拿着﹁王子﹂的證章，也天然的應該佔些便宜。舉例來說，最近據說因爲某種嫌疑，在上海同時捕獲廖乂乂等五人，如果說﹁有罪﹂的話，自然五人都有罪了，然而因爲廖乂乂是先烈的公子，便有人給他一枚可以佔便宜的證章，因而很快的便被保釋了，而其餘四人則終於﹁解京法究。﹂</p>
<p>當然，我們並不是說准許廖乂乂保釋是不應該的事，我們不過覺得因爲廖乂乂是先烈的公子便准許保釋，實在是非常可怪的事。但廖乂乂因爲是先烈的公子，便宜是已經佔定了，其餘四人呢，我們一想到近年來許多靑年在解京之後便不知下落的事實，眞禁不住爲他們的前途擔心！</p>
<p>革命據說已經成功，﹁民權﹂亦已列入救世的經典，然而﹁民權﹂究竟不及﹁軍權﹂﹁官權﹂的來頭大，還有賴於特種證章的保護，於是同時而又在同一地方被捕的靑年，便天然有的該被保釋，而有的該解京，該法究，該不知所終。至於進南京城時須受檢查與否，究竟還只是狠小的區别。</p>

<p>— 林微音</p>
<p>究竟在跑些什麽？我可告訴你。</p>
<p>我每次出門都似乎是去赴一個非赴不可的約，或者去作一些非作不可的事。在出門以前雖然没有想到去什麽地方，但出了門，總有個把地方會顯現進意識中來的。於是我就到那意識到了的地方去，彷彿在那裏有什麽所愛見的人在等着，或者我所偏好的事情在進行似地。到了，如我所早該想像到的，才知什麽都没有，有的依舊是平淡的人在談庸腐的話。於是我等着，等着我所愛見的人和我所偏好的事，在那一羣談庸腐的話的平淡的人的中間。</p>
<p>在那一羣人中間，我聽他們談，談得很有味。我傾聽着，有時彷彿我是那談話的一羣或數羣的一員或每羣的一員。有時呢，他們的話我什麽都不聽到，彷彿我是在一個萬籟俱寂的地方似地。我只是我，獨自的我。我看他們來，看他們去；有時忽然看到或一桌上已換了一個集團，不知前者去於何時，後者來於何時。可是我所愛見的或偏好的依舊没有蒞臨。</p>
<p>於是我知道我錯了，要是我不到這里來而到了另一地方去，我該已碰到了我的欲望的對象了的。於是我起身，又到了另一公衆塲所去。而我的欲望依舊不能被完成，這於我自己却似並不驚異。可是，什麽是我的欲望？或者說什麽是我所愛見的人，什麽是我所偏好的事？這，我答不大出來，實在，我不大淸楚。或者就是那跑了一個公衆場所又跑一個公衆塲所？我不大淸楚。</p>
<p>是的，這就是我的跑的究竟。</p>

<p>﹁老林，再拿一個給我。﹂</p>
<p>這眞嚇了他一跳，何以世光吃得那樣的快。他再走過去檢了一個來給了世光。</p>

<p>第二天早上起來時，九點多鐘了。他只看見秋英在替小孩子换水布。世光不知跑向那兒去了。</p>

<p>丨不要開頑笑。使得這些蠢人注意的唯一的方法，駝石，祇在幹些非常的事情。揚言你要到北極去作畫。打扮得像埃及王一樣在外面徘徊。創立一種宗派。把一些術語拌在一塊：如力的表現之類，並擬出一些宣言。否認動或靜，白或黑，圓周或矩形。發明只能辨出紅黄兩色的新荷馬風畫，圓柱形畫，八面體狀畫，四元畫······</p>
<p>這時，一種奇異而温和的芳香報告科斯勒烏斯加夫人進來了。這是駝石所傾倒的一個漂亮的波蘭女人。她定閱一些高價的雜誌，這些雜誌化着很大的本錢翻印一些三歲小孩的傑作；她因爲在這裏面尋不出誠實的畫家駝石的名字，便看不起他的繪畫。她倒在沙發上，瞧着那幅已經着手的畫布，搖着她那頭金黄的頭髮，帶着些兒遺恨微笑着：</p>
<p>丨我昨天看見，她用一種如簧的婉轉的聲調說，一個現代黑人藝術展覽會。啊！這種藝術的感受性，想像和力哟！畫家把他自己滿意的一幅肖像畫轉給她看。</p>
<p>丨不壞。她隨便說，隨後帶着她那如簧的婉轉的聲調，滿身的芳香消失了。駝石把調色板丢在一邊，倒在沙發上：﹁我要改行去做保險公司的稽查，銀行的辦事員，警務人員等等。繪畫是最下的職業。由那些愚人做就的成功·祇有那些陰謀家才能得到。批評家不尊重畫師，却鼓勵那些野蠻人。這事我眞夠受了，我不再幹了。</p>
<p>格萊絲一面聽着他的話，一面燃吸着一支紙烟，考慮了一會：</p>
<p>丨你願意給這些時俗之徒和僞藝術家一個應得的敎訓嗎？他終於說話了。你覺得你有能力對科斯勒烏斯加和别的耽美主義者神秘而又嚴肅地宣稱，你十年來就已從事於你的畫法的革新嗎？</p>
<p>丨我嗎？誠實的駝石吃驚地說。</p>
<p>丨聽我說······我去用兩篇很觸目的論文告訴大家，說你創立了觀念分析派。在你以前的肖像畫家，祇曉得研究人的臉孔。無意識的事啊！這是不對的，眞的代表一個人的，是他在我們心裏所唤起的觀念。譬如一個大佐的肖像，那是籃色和金色的底子上横列着五條巨大的袖章，一個角上畫着一隻馬，另一個角上畫着一些勛章。一個實業家的肖像，那是一府工廠的烟囱，一隻放在桌上的緊握着的拳頭。駝石，你懂得你要給人家的東西嗎？並且你能夠在一個月裏給我畫二十幅觀念分析派的肖像嗎？</p>
<p>畫家悄然微笑着。（未完）</p>

<p>一現新價一一零一元終於升兩元六</p>
<p>晨開爲將徵出口銀稅而漲</p>
<p>旋爲美限制藏金訊而回跌</p>
<p>後市爲德擬棄金本位續小</p>
<p>金市昨日變幻百出、初高而後低、晨初因外電大條銀略升零六二五、紐約銀價長一二五、英美美英兩匯兌升六二五及五六二五、遠期銀價升五毫及一釐半、最後之兩月份跌一釐及一毫、美棉漲五磅音、雖不見多、加之中央政治會議决議廢兩改元後、出口幣材一律徵稅百分之二·二五、人心遂好、毛盤開出卽跳爲九十二三元、恒餘福昌日昌春源永義豐永均有買進、而升至九十七八元、此時私電報來長一二五、略形退下、迨開盤爲一零九七元二角、匯市開出略緊、但因外電美國政府頒令民户每家祇能藏金一百元、逾額須受處分、此與禁金令無異、蓋民間除每户藏有現金一百元外、盡爲紙幣矣、乃起跌風、廣帮仍來售條、匯市略硬、遂破九十元關、而降至一零八八元三角、入後匯市轉佳、七月份美金由二十九元半做至三一二五、而漲至一千一百零一元新高價、華比出七月份美金二五、午收遂爲一零九八元七角、下午開盤九元半、跌風仍猛、外電美財長搜集銀價會議材料、孟買升二安那、以及德國行將放棄金本位等等不利消息傳來、價遂降至九十元、雖因德國尚無一定辦法、回升四元餘、但因猶太商喬直夫售條、故又破九十元至八十九元半、收盤爲一零九零元二角、烚赤初加二十五六元、最後照加二十一元、掉期貼價由十二元退至九元、現貨來源不絶、今將一日間市况誌之於後、</p>

<p>下午開盤爲一零九九元半、物品開八元八角、恒興限盤欲賣而未得、福昌趁勢脫售少數、遂退至八元内、蓋因五月份美金八七五六月份二五可結也、協興永則進、盤旋於八元内外、福餘售條、而爲七元三角、物品及日昌爭購、乃一躍而至九元、正金出來七月份美金三一二五、春源永福餘又出、而降至七元内、元茂永亦賣、而爲五元半、志豐永上塲納條、好到六元六角、金城亦塞七月份美金三一二五、元茂永又售、而降至五元光景、五月份美金九三七五銀行肯出、元盛永恒餘奮售、退至三元、志豐永仍納、大德成亦買、而至四元半、此後匯市缺乏成交、塲内全由人心而上落、外電德國將廢止金本位之訊傳來、孟買亦升、一時賣氣忽盛、義豐永兆豐昌志豐永爭售、一瀉四元餘、降爲九十元、恒餘連續買進、散户又抬、漸漸升至四元外、無何恒餘忽來脫手、對手缺乏、仍形下游、福昌亦賣、又降至九十元、但因源康祥買進、而升上三元、蓋此時市價缺乏標準、散户本抬撳之能事、金價遂怱上怱落、其後德國放棄金本位之說再傳、瑞興脫售多次、銀行對做本月份美金八七五、乃破九十元關、退至八十九元半、收盤爲一零九零元二角、收市後續形下游、物品傾售、故物品拍八十八元八、查全日最高一一零一元、最低八八元三角、有十二元七角上落、結果較前收略升二元六角、</p>

<p>掉期貼價續低、乾昌祥（泰康潤）盈豐恒等爭先掉同、同豐恒亦有落手之勢、寶因客帮來源川流不息、現貨號納胃俱飽、不得不賤價做掉期、故上塲卽由乾昌祥（泰康潤）貼進十二元、由恒餘貼出一百零五條、大興永貼予盈豐恒七十條、十一元半、大康貼予盈豐恒三十五條、爲十一元、恒興貼予盈豐恒又减至十元零五角、（盈豐恒吃進客帮到貨）成交七十條、恒興又貼予乾昌祥二十八條、亦爲十元零五角、恒興劃予盈豐恒四月份條子一百七十五條、價一一零二元、後市更賤、元茂永貼出二百十條、祥豐七十條、俱由盈豐恒貼進九元、元茂永貼予大豐恒七十條、同價、四月份條子尚剩四千二百九十八條　　四月份公單由乾昌祥解出一百十九條、盈豐恒四十二條、由同豐恒收進一百十二條、潤昌永二十一條、潤昌裕十四條、恒興恒餘各七條、共計一百六十一條收解、</p>
<p>後此大約以銀子輸出有納稅之關係、輪出不無减少、大條因之見長金價或將帶小、但外匯以貿易逆轉之影響、本當輸出銀貨、以抵補貿易上之入超額、恐特以銀輸出有稅之故、或將更緊、昨市軋平交易甚多、卽慮此後金價之變化也、</p>

<p>對時局之認識處目前内外時局之重大性、已經在去年春頭及舊臘召集之團隊長會議席上、曾經極詳細之說明、這裏無庸贅啄、自從去年九月十五日日本正式承認﹁滿洲國﹂、以至於最近堅决脫出國際聯盟、日本帝國雖處於對外孤立、對内混亂之中、然吾等軍人能以百折不撓步武處治非常時期之危機、殊爲帝國之前途慶祝、今後深望各位能更堅决負起衛國精神之使命、上下一致準備國家總動員、善處未來更大之危局、</p>
<p>軍隊之統率與指導我輩軍人已負起如此重大使命、那末爲發揮軍隊之本質、只有加緊鞏固軍隊内部之統率、與對組織活動及統制精神之嚴密指導、中央首腦部特别留意此點、經過幾次攻究結果、認爲今後對組織上原動樞軸之各級隊長之地位與職權、有特别尊重與擁護必要、尤其對新進之靑年將校、指揮官應負有嚴格之統率監督、和以慈愛之善導誘掖、俾使全軍能自憤自省、團結在嚴肅軍紀之下努力振作</p>
<p>兵備改革案之實施久在計劃中之時局匡救兵備改善案、巳在六十四屆國會通過、此乃陸軍主要對策之一、只要預算成立、就即刻進行實施、時局兵備改革案、爲適應時局之危急而施設、諸制度之改善内容、以一九三三、三四年度之緊急事業爲基礎、但認爲必要時、可施爲恒久之整備、</p>
<p>人員之補充關於作戰人員之處置、去年師團長會議時已有充分之叙述、爲要鞏固統率之實力、必定要有優秀技術人員之提拔、與作戰隊長之充實、中央部特别留意此點、深望各位能切實選拔新進人材、又隨着兵備改革之實施、特别志願士官之擴大與特務曹長定員之增加、應適當加以配置、至於特别志願士官之採用、更要特别留意其履歷和人格、經徹底之審查之後始可收留、應加緊提防赤化份子之潛入、</p>
<p>關於軍事預算依照目前日本財政及經濟界之狀態、世人往往抱懷悲觀論調、但吾人深信國民能負起此巨大預算的、雖然在非常時國家財政上不斷增加了不少赤字公債、但爲挽救目前之緊急不得不使然、希望各位能體貼國家財政之現狀、與本預算編成之本旨、竭力排除各種濫費、積極在適當之兵備改善與技術人員補充上面使行、</p>
<p>關於全國民之後援在現代戰爭之下、最主要爲全體國民之總動員、能爲國防之後盾、所以應努力動員所有力量、在各地擴大並加强國防協會與防空協會之組織、積極說明内外危機之情勢、務使全體國民能在軍部指揮之下、撲滅外來思想之輸入、上下一致在挽救國難使命之下邁進、</p>
<p>在鄉軍人會之改組戰爭開始以來、全國在鄉軍人能奮起爲國家效勞、的確舉得感激、但在此時機應對在鄉軍人會從來所有之懸案及内部陣容有所改革、努力補充其不足、加强在軍民一體精神之下、澈底施以救國敎育使其更有力爲國防服務、</p>
<p>學生及靑年訓練純潔的靑年及學生、往往會被外來思想所迷、諸位對此應施以特别敎育、尤其上級學校學生更加需要積極之指導、不久幹部候補生制度改正、形將實施、所以對全國上級學校之學生敎練、要重新改组起來、對學校當事者尤其努力使其振作、加緊對學生思想之監督與指導、靑年爲國家百年大計最重要份子、各地靑年訓練所尤其要切實之援助與敎育才對、（下略）</p>

<p>改革警政制度、前文局長曾有此提案、嗣因冬防時期、未予實行、兹據俞氏表示、謂警政制度改革之進行、現尚未至實施時期、蓋因一方面閘北各區、忙於整理復興、同時欲先將警察力量充實、並增加訓練工夫、一俟此兩點工作完竣、然後方能實施改革、至於公安局遷往舊上海縣址一事、因現在正將縣址修葺中、恐尚稍需時日、</p>

<h3 id="c259">芳澤來哉！ <a href="#c259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>近日來，春光日見明媚，口外日見和平，一般熱心於﹁决心抵抗﹂的同志仁兄，皆大歡喜，少不了彼此稱賀，大家握手道好，﹁勞駕勞駕，這次總算又是大功告成﹂從此可告天下太平。。</p>
<p>恰好，這時候。，同文而又同種的友邦之芳澤。，居然於這兩國邦交素稱隆重而馬上更要密切的情形中翩然蒞止了。。眞是巧極。。</p>
<p>芳澤爲甚來華？盡人皆知，原因十足，不僅是游游而已，而且要訪問﹁老友﹂。據芳澤自己說，這老友即是王正廷同志，以老友會老友。，當然大家都是同志。，不消說。，其出也，融融。！</p>
<p>在此以前，記得蔣公使被召還朝，到現在還没有回任，雖然這與芳澤來華未必有前因後果，不過聯想起來。，亦可槪見冠蓋往來之盛。。</p>
<p>但是芳澤這次駕臨，似乎不免掃興，最明顯的便是政府的﹁决不招待﹂（見一日中央社電）。然而不要緊。，政府由牠公事公辦。，同志交誼總不麻胡。。所以將來﹁老友﹂齊聚一堂。，談談笑笑。，仍是很有﹁道理﹂的。。何况日外省旣經負責聲明：﹁全係私人行動，不負政府使命﹂，當然芳澤之來。，不一定就要我政府之堂皇的招待。，只要﹁老友﹂﹁同志﹂陪着他游歷游歷。，也就很可以心領神會。，很合乎所謂﹁大家都是一家人。，何必拘禮節。？﹂而且同日電文中，又有羅外長﹁恐有盲目之虞，將赴滬延德醫割治，﹂所以芳澤竟不去首都。，亦未始不可。。</p>
<p>復次，革命如中央的﹁一貫方針永不改變﹂，也是使我們正在掙扎着的老百姓十分相信得過的，現在再來一個决不招待。，以示决心。，眞足以告鬼神而昭日月了。。可見這與直接交涉的謠言完全無關。，眞是鬼都也不疑。。</p>
<p>如上所述，那末北平工會救國聯合會雷國府，請勿招待芳澤，以杜謠傳，那眞是狗屁之極。</p>

<p>俺是一個無業者，不過俺可不是游民。</p>
<p>俺幹的那調調兒，壓根兒用不到一個大做本錢兒，是不列在三百六十行之内的。甚麽將本求利啦，甚麽一本萬利啦，在俺眼珠子裏轉，都是幹着强盜的勾當。搶人家的錢，騙人家的錢，没命的望腰包裏裝，夠丢臉哪。</p>
<p>有人說，你花不了一個大做本，莫不是伸手大將軍？</p>
<p>呸，跟着人呌化，俺都瞧不上眼皮兒，俺倒偷偷摸摸地幹亡八羔子的扒兒手不成。</p>
<p>一個人，爸娘成着釘鈀般的二隻手，還怕没得吃喝麽？俺也曾口袋裏裝過上千上萬，花花綠綠的鈔票兒，俺也曾有過花姐兒做姨太太。麕甚麽玩意兒没幹過？小傢伙兒，樓着好精兒跳呀跳的，顫呀顫的，呸，希甚麽罕。俺若不是把上千上萬白花花的銀子，眼看着打指縫裏滾出去，今日之下，誰敢來挑俺的眼？</p>
<p>得囉，俺如今是望麽都看破了。富貴榮華，也不過是那麽一回事。整天價括天括地，孤拐兒一挺，又帶不進棺材，爲甚麽來着？</p>
<p>俺是一個無業者，不過俺可不是游民。</p>
<p>俺的生活，跟那些上跳戲塲，樓女人的小傢伙兒，倒有些像，不到下午三四點鐘出們，俺就覺得甚麽都没得勁兒。</p>

<p>俺在馬路上找烟屁股兒，一天祗十二口袋，二口袋滿了，俺就把牠帶到張四那傢伙店裏去。張四那傢伙眞夠朋友，二口袋烟屁股，不多不少，不管好歹，總給俺半吊錢。八個子兒，換一頓吃，喝，八個子兒，留着明天吃喝。多着的，哈哈，說起了精神抖擻，紅珠子，俺不愛吸，不客氣，烟泡，土皮，已夠俺一天一夜的受用。</p>

<p>— 溪</p>
<p>四月一日，爲西人的﹁說謊節﹂。西俗：每年是日，可以﹁說謊﹂，以﹁愚弄﹂友人，不以爲﹁侮﹂；惟此事起源，則漫不可考矣。</p>
<p>或曰；西人﹁謊﹂而可﹁說﹂，且爲之特置一﹁節﹂，不啻標榜狡黠之風。此風一長，爾虞我詐，交相愚弄，世道人心，尚堪聞問乎？咱們貴國，畢覺尚懸着﹁禮義之邦﹂，﹁信義爲本﹂之金字招牌，所以舊有節氣，多至念四，今因歐風東漸，又添上什麽﹁婦女節﹂﹁兒童節﹂﹁敎師節﹂﹁勞動節﹂﹁禁烟節﹂等等等等，獨不把說謊佳節盛行起來，甚至歐化之高等華人亦鮮有向它問信者，即恐與金字招牌抵觸，大有﹁碍難照辦﹂之苦衷在也。</p>
<p>抑知咱們貴國，名義上雖尚無說謊佳節之審定頒佈，但在實際上，一般聰明的國人們，尤其是負有守土衛國責任的將爺們，對於﹁說謊﹂一道，早巳﹁身先士卒﹂地風行着了，只不過尚未正式﹁擇吉開張﹂，明令歸定何日爲佳節而巳。</p>
<p>熱河未失守，則通電全國，表示﹁抵抗决心﹂，發表談話，表示﹁誓死守士﹂；及至失守，則又說﹁這是意料中事﹂併且﹁不難反攻﹂！</p>
<p>西南當局，對於出師抗日軍事，聽說早已决定具體計劃，并已行過誓師典禮。但下文﹁即日北上﹂四字，像煞﹁長期抵抗﹂之妙用，不怕望穿了多至四萬七千萬雙的眼睛！</p>
<p>﹁討伐僞國﹂，﹁收復失地﹂，﹁反攻承德﹂，說油了要人的口，聽膩了國人之耳，幾乎完全成了二十世紀大中華民國油口膩耳之現代神話！</p>
<p>最近乂乂先生又高唱着：﹁不出今年年底，東北失地，决可恢復﹂。某中委也有﹁十年内日本必有大革命﹂之料。其肯定口吻，似比袁天罡的推背圖，劉伯温的燒餅歌，還來得準確。</p>
<p>他如監察院嘗彈効某某官吏，但結果坐罪與否？則往往如石落大海。商店冒國貨之名，實則暢銷仇貨；掛着戒烟藥膏之招牌，實行售賣鴉片之勾當；大吹大擂之血本犧牲，反在貨價上大大加上一筆宣傳費。一切的一切，要皆極盡﹁說謊﹂之能事，集盡﹁愚弄﹂同胞之大成，一年三百六十天，幾乎天天都在大有人﹁說謊﹂，﹁愚弄﹂同胞，即無異天天都是過着普天同慶的東方式的﹁說謊佳節﹂！</p>
<p>但是牢牢記着：西人只四月一日，謹存被人愚弄之戒心，我國則一年到底都要飽聽﹁姑妄言之﹂的鬼話，防不勝防。這顯然是我們被人愚弄了，不知仿西人引爲大侮，才致養成對方的這樣﹁積重難返﹂的惡習的吧！</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我是一個十七歲的弱女子丨丨不是店員丨丨想來不會拒絶我的請求吧？我的父親不幸於去年逝世了，現在家裏祇有一位慈母和一個弱弟。我在十二歲那年父親與我許了一門親，那時我一些也不懂，一切都由父母作主，對方現在已二十五歲了，在一家商店裏做夥友，每月的收入雖微少，不過他尚知自儉，面貌是平常，性情倒還温和，這一切都由母親說我聽的，我的心裏，有幾分不願意嫁，不願意的理由有三個：（一）年齡相差八歲，（二）對方家無恒産，（三）定本年底結婚，所以我想解約，但又有三個難題（一）母親頗爲贊成，我若决意反對，必使母親不快，我亦不安，（二）訂婚時曾交換照片庚貼，並有媒證，（三）解約後，再行擇配，是否定能比前者美滿，我没有把握！没有决斷力丨全仗先生大力丨在報端賜我一個美滿的答復。此請</p>
<p>撰安！弱女羅玉瓶謹上四月三日</p>
<p>乂　　乂　　乂　　乂　　乂</p>
<p>編者按：盲目的婚姻，現時代的一般人都巳加以詬病子。假使羅女士已覺察對方有﹁不堪爲偶﹂的地方，那麽不妨儘管題出解約，法律上亦得到相當的保障，因爲這是没有得到本人的同意。不過我們從羅女士的來信中看來，雖然由她的父親給她訂婚於五年前，可是與對方一面都没有見過。所以羅女士雖提出三個不願意的理由，我們認爲都是膚淺的不願意，並不是有了眞切認識的不願意。我們姑且先把這三個理由來研究一下：</p>
<p>關於第一點，古者﹁男子三十而娶，女子二十而嫁﹂；依照生理學上講，雙方配偶，也應當以女子小於男子爲準則，並且女子容顔較男子爲易老。故年齡上相差，我們認爲不成問題。至於第二點，我們以爲不當以﹁有恒産無恒産﹂爲標準，應當以﹁有没有自立能力﹂爲標準第三點我們深表贊同，女士不妨以年齡尚穉爲推託，請令堂挽人與對方商量，展緩一年或半載，在這一年半載的當中，先作爲一種友誼的認識，（但切勿以﹁已訂婚﹂的觀念預先梗在胸中）然後使對方的性情能力及其他方面，加以詳密的觀察，這樣可以比較耳聞來的可以眞切一點。那時如發覺對方確有﹁不堪爲偶﹂的地方，再行提出解約，那便﹁難題﹂也不成爲﹁難題﹂的了。設能性情相投，那麽在這一年半載友誼之中，愛苗滋長，結果便是美滿的婚姻。因爲婚姻的眞諦，是建築在﹁愛情﹂上的呀。</p>

<p>— 西容</p>
<p>魯道爾夫范倫鐵諾死後</p>
<p>最爲女性所追求之一人</p>
<p>凡稍知影界掌故的人，都能記得魯道爾夫范倫鐵諾（RudolpbValentins）死後出殯時的盛况；那是一位大總统身後的哀榮，還不能及其一半。范倫鐵諾生前之爲女性所傾倒，到處爲女性羣衆所困，那是更不用說的了。現在好萊塢，新出了一位范倫鐵諾第二；形貌舉止，幾與范倫鐵諾一般無二。這位新出的星，名字呌喬治賴甫脫（GeorgeRaft）。他自在﹁傷面人﹂片中一露身手之後，已經轟動了全美的影迷們，都說范倫鐵諾復活了。賴甫脫在范倫鐵諾的生前，已與他相交莫逆。他們二人，雖然一生於墨西哥，一生於美國的紐約，但他們能相聚一處，同事多年，並且二人形貌相像，見之者俱疑爲兄弟，亦可謂天緣巧合了。</p>
<p>後來范倫鐵諾生前放棄了跳舞生涯而入影界。那時候他曾勸賴甫脫同去好萊塢，因爲他們非但可以在銀幕上扮作兄弟，並且就是在銀幕上作他的替身，亦没有人認得出來。不意賴甫脫，一來不欲因人成事，二則跳舞生涯，亦不願一旦放棄，所以就與范倫鐵諾分手了。現在重來好萊塢，與范倫鐵諾已相隔泉壤，不禁有滄桑之感了。</p>
<p>賴甫脫到處爲瘋狂的女性所困，亦與范倫鐵諾生前相仿。賴甫脫雖有保鏢書記僕人等等，但終不能防止女性的向賴甫脫侵擾。無論是火車站，旅館的客室，戲院門口，他的汽車週圍，都圍滿了如痴如醉的女性：有時竟乘人不備，攔入他的寢室，要求一吻；雖說這是艶福無窮，却也閙得他寢食不寗，毫無自由樂趣。再則向他求紀念品的，除了簽名題字之外，他的帽子，手巾襟花，衣服上的鈕扣，鞋上的鞋帶，她們都要攫取。有一天賴甫脫在蒂脫勞意地方一家戲院出來，爲許多女性包圍了，將他衣服都撕破了。等到警察將他救上汽車，上身的衣服都不知去向了，袴子亦撕得粉碎。</p>
<p>范倫鐵諾前在波士頓亦有同樣的經騐。那時有一羣女性在戲院門口將他包圍住了。等到范倫諾殺出重圍，身上除了幾處傷斑血印之外，幾乎一無所有了。現在賴甫脫再不敢走戲院的正門，必定要等人羣散了之後，從旁面小門中溜出去。有時候終夜睡在戲院室中，尚還有淘氣的女子，從救火梯爬上去要和他一會。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c267">評﹁古屋疑雲﹂ＡＤangerousAffair <a href="#c267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>近半年來﹁恐怖﹂化的影片，的確是投一般人的所好，而得到了莫大的勝利。所以昨天卡爾登所映的﹁古屋疑雲﹂，吸引去了不少的觀衆。</p>
<p>牠述一位巡長和一位記者友善，他們同時認識了一位女郎，那記者夜入女郎屋中竊得項圈，打算借此與女郎親近。不料那時一位女郎的一位尊長，死後遺囑上說，一切産業槪歸女郎，但女郎在接受此遺産時，必須仍保有巳往的手飾項圈。這時記者和巡長打算交還項圈，而竟又被竊。於是一同到女郎尊長所有的古屋裏去偵查，幾番波折卒得珠還合浦。案旣大白：記者和女郎也就償了宿願。</p>
<p>在編劇者的目的，除了描寫遺産爲害，足使同族成仇讐以外，就僅僅用恐怖的色彩，來號召而已，劇義上是非常淺薄的。</p>
<p>全片中，完全用滑稽的方式來表演。所以牠的恐怖，只好算一部份的穿揷。然而牠不能算滑稽片的，因爲牠有良好丨合理化丨的劇情。戀愛方面描寫，除收尾一吻外，什麽也没有。哥倫比亞是新興公司，牠這張出品，我只好認爲牠是新興的另具作風的喜劇。的確，這片子有極特别，極新頴的意味。</p>
<p>劇情長，影片短，所以除去述事以外，勢難再含有多量的表情。傑克霍特</p>
<h3 id="c268">蘇俄影片﹁亞洲風雲﹂今日公映 <a href="#c268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>蘇俄影片最負繁名之作﹁亞洲風雲，﹂現悉已定今日起在福生路明珠大戲院開始放映。微聞外界最初有傳該片將在上海大戲院開演之說，兹查未成事實因該片抨擊現代壓迫者甚力，該院大門門首，正當租界，恐有種種不便。故决定排在完全中國地帶之明珠大戲院，正式公映。至價目一層，該院爲力求大衆化起見，祗售小洋三角五角。按蘇俄影片售價之如此低廉者，此其爲第一次云。</p>
<p>JockHolt飾的巡長，十足的君子風度，沉默中的表演，也居上乘。全片中，他作了一個領導者，綽綽有餘。不過特别精彩地方，却没有什麽，這片子裏，除他以外都是配角丨没有副主角丨表演大致還好，多半是極詼諧的角色，打破了﹁恐怖﹂的沉悶。</p>
<p>光線不錯。攝影極平庸，許多鏡頭，用同一的地位攝出，很是單調。對白中有無數可笑的詞句，所以並不討厭。發音上，略有雜音，似乎是放映機的毛病。在技術，這片子的特長是組織和剪接上下的緊凑，增加許多恐怖和笑料，生色不少。佈景平常，夠不上神秘和偉大。</p>
<p>這片子很大的缺憾，是表出不夠。有許多人物和事情，呌看的人，不能明瞭，此外的小漏洞也有，例如手槍的稀少等等，不必深論了。</p>

<p>— 影微</p>
<p>從幾大前的電影專刊中，翻閱到一篇﹁由都會的早晨﹂說到﹁城市之夜，﹂不禁使我啞然失笑了。</p>
<p>我們且要去說﹁城市之夜﹂與﹁都會的早晨﹂是那一部成功或失敗，因爲！兩片開映時都同樣有整幅的批評，批評者及觀衆都很明白。</p>
<p>假如不是像﹁椀﹂先生那麽無知，那末丨每個關心電影的讀者必然會知道﹁都會的早晨﹂與﹁城市之夜﹂的開始攝片，是否先後兩三個月，是不是﹁都會的早晨﹂開攝後，中間又停了我幾個月，等候﹁城市之夜﹂出來了，好去模仿，</p>
<p>再說﹁都會的早晨﹂的﹁光明之路﹂暗示得不大請楚而﹁城市之夜﹂的﹁光明之路﹂則只好讓你椀先生自己去﹁掙扎前進。﹂</p>
<p>編者按：﹁城市之夜﹂及﹁都會的早晨﹂攝製的先後及相隔之時間，影微君如有所知，儘可據實駁倒﹁椀﹂君的理論；但認﹁椀﹂不知攝影公司攝製兩片之先後，卽謂爲﹁無知，﹂極非忠恕之道。况旣闢一﹁親衆意見﹂欄，原屬給與電影觀衆以一披　意見之地位。意見各有不同，亦不可强人以相同，望閱者能諒此點，勿將此欄闢爲戰場可也。不敏</p>

<p>Our Cavalry Counterattacks and Breaks Through Enemy Defense Line</p>
<p>Enemy Reinforcements Launched a Counterattack on Houmafang</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Launched Three-Pronged Attack on Haiyangzhen, All Unsuccessful</p>
<p>British and American Warships Protect Kailuan Mining Bureau</p>
<p>Situation in Qinhuangdao Slightly Eases, Passenger Train Service to Beining Resumes</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the enemy occupied our Shimentun, their offensive plan divided into two routes. One route crossed the Liujiang River directly to attack Haiyang. The other route advanced from Shihe Hongwadian to attack Tang River Tiema Village, intending to outflank Qinhuangdao. The enemy's right flank on the Haiyang line was repelled by our forces, reducing the enemy's activity on its left flank. Our division commander Wang Qifeng and commander Yao Dongfan transferred troops on the fifth night to launch a fierce attack on the enemy at Tang River. This morning at 8 o'clock, the enemy on the Tang River front retreated to the vicinity of Hongwadian. Our left flank also launched an attack, forcing the enemy to retreat to the highlands east of Anminzhai, where they stubbornly resisted, (Sixth Dispatch).</p>
<p>(Beiping) Luanzhou telegraph: Our cavalry division commander supervised a regiment and two companies of infantry at midnight on the sixth, launching a counterattack against enemy troops in the Jianglu area. Fierce fighting continued until about 8:00 AM when our army broke through the enemy's defense line and occupied two key locations. The enemy retreated, their main force retreating to the line of the Zha City tribal villages. Our cavalry is currently pursuing. Zhang Shengda, the third company commander of our cavalry, was seriously injured. On the line of Houmafang, north of Qinhuangdao, we are still confronting the enemy (Sixth Dispatch).</p>
<p>Linyu, from dawn to afternoon on the fifth, five or six hundred enemies attacked our Haiyangzhen several times along the left bank of the Tang River. All were repelled by our cavalry troops. A portion of the enemy advanced south along the Liujiang Railway, appearing to be probing Zhai Huangdao (Fifth Dispatch).</p>
<p>(Beiping) After our army recovered Haiyangzhen, the enemy launched fierce attacks last night, dividing its attack on Haiyangzhen into three routes. One route attacked Haiyang along the Liujiang Railway line. Last night around 10 o'clock, enemy infantry and cavalry teams, each numbering more than five hundred, advanced from Hanzhuang. They encountered our army in Zhaozhuang, and a fierce battle ensued. The enemy was unable to withstand the attack and was eventually repelled by our forces. This morning at 2:00 AM, the enemy redeployed reinforcements from Shimentun and continued to attack Haiyang. They are currently still in a standoff. Another route attacked the Taipingzhai Dawangzhuang Xiaojiagang area from the Anminzhai area, attempting to attack the front of our Haiyangzhen. This enemy force numbered more than a thousand and was very rampant. Last night, they bombarded the positions around Dawangzhuang Shishan with heavy artillery. Our unit defended the area, engaging in a desperate battle with the enemy. The enemy ultimately failed to succeed. Fierce fighting continued in the area this morning. Another enemy route crossed the Beining line from Dong Fujiatun, using Xiangjiazhai as its base, and attacked Qianmafang, Houmafang, and Lijunzhuang, a dozen miles from Qinhuangdao, attempting to seize Qinhuangdao and cut off the Haiyang communication line. After 10 o'clock last night, fierce fighting broke out in the area. The sound of artillery fire was deafening. Our army has increased its troops. Fighting continued at around 2 o'clock this morning. It is reported that the enemy is determined to capture Tai Island and Haiyang. Both sides have suffered heavy casualties in recent days (Sixth Dispatch).</p>
<p>(Beiping) Luan County telephone: This morning, the enemy troops have withdrawn from Tiezhuang. A unit of our army has advanced to the position and is in contact with a certain regiment of Qinhuangdao. After 7:00 AM this morning, there was light rain and heavy sea fog near Qinhuangdao. Enemy planes did not come. At 2:00 PM, three enemy planes scouted near Shenhebao. Yesterday evening, British and American warships arrived at Qinhuangdao to protect the Kailuan Mining Bureau (Sixth Dispatch).</p>
<p>(Beiping) Passenger train services between Qinhuangdao and Beiping on the Beining Line will resume as normal today, according to a notice from the Beining Railway Bureau, due to the easing of the situation in Qinhuangdao (Sixth Dispatch).</p>
<p>(Beiping) At dawn today, more than 300 enemy troops were discovered in the Fanjiaodian area, attempting to bypass Qian Yuezhuang and attack our Haiyangzhen directly. We discovered and surrounded the enemy, and after more than an hour of fierce fighting, we finally defeated the enemy. The enemy attacking Qinhuangdao retreated after a fierce battle with our army in Houmafang due to being unable to sustain their attack. This morning, the enemy deployed reinforcements from the pier and launched another attack on Houmafang. The situation is critical and is currently stalemated with our army (Sixth Dispatch).</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Transportation circles report that fierce fighting continued between Haiyangzhen and Houzhuang, and near Tang River, from morning to noon on the sixth. Enemy planes continuously bombed our positions. The sound of gunfire was very clear in Qinhuangdao, and the sound of artillery fire was deafening. Because of the Kailuan Mining Bureau, enemy planes and artillery dared not bomb the island. The situation on the ground was tense on the morning of the sixth, and the people fleeing west were in chaos (Sixth Dispatch).</p>
<p>(Beiping) On the Tang River side, on the fifth, three to four hundred enemy cavalry advanced to the vicinity of Tiezhuang. Their follow-up troops also advanced towards Houmafang and came into contact with our cavalry in Xinli Wuzhuang. By 9:00 PM, more than 100 enemy troops attacked the Ping Shan Ying Nan Xing Zhuang area and were repelled by our forces. Around 10:00 PM, a large unit of enemy soldiers, about 600, invaded the Wangjialing Haojiazhuang line and are currently engaged with our army (Sixth Dispatch).</p>
<p>(Beiping) Haiyangzhen became a contested battleground all day yesterday, and it was extremely fierce. To avoid the railway line war, the enemy is now advancing towards the Pingyu Avenue. He Zhuguo has transferred a unit to block the attack (Sixth Dispatch).</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Transportation circles report that the situation in Qinhuangdao is deteriorating, and the Kailuan mining area south of the railway is also filled with an atmosphere of terror. Merchants and residents north of the railway have closed their doors, shrouded in the cloud of war. There are many frights in one night. Enemy ships have been patrolling between Beidaihe and Qinhuangdao because British ships prevented marines from landing at the Kailuan Pier, attempting to land on the shore. They have not been able to do so because the beach is shallow (Sixth Dispatch).</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to a certain source, Muto has issued a secret order to Zhang Haipeng and the commanders of the Japanese divisions, limiting them to occupy the counties of eastern Luan within ten days. The 16th Division of the Pomu, which recently arrived in Jinzhou from Japan, has been dispatched from Yuguan since the fifth, and it is reported that it will be the main force attacking Haiyang Funing. Qinhuangdao will become a difficult place to hold (Sixth Dispatch).</p>
<p>(Luanzhou) The war in eastern Luan is expanding to Qinhuangdao. He Zhuguo is determined to defend to the death and has ordered his troops not to lose an inch of land. On the morning of the fifth, enemy troops spied on Qin along the Liujiang coal mine railway line, clashing with the garrison in Houmafang, five miles north of Qin, and were blocked by our troops. At noon, more than fifty enemy planes threatened Qin Port in formation for more than an hour. The situation was serious. The whole city was panicked, and the Kailuan area was also pessimistic. Our army is guarding the fortifications strictly. A large number of enemy ships are anchored on the sea surface of Yuyu, Qin, and Beidaihe. Five are in Guitizhai, west of Qin, and one is flying a flag at the south end of the Nanda Temple station. The aircraft carrier moved to the South Sea off Yuguan at Weishi (Fifth Dispatch).</p>
<p>(Luanzhou) He Zhuguo reiterated to the British and American troops stationed in Qin and the Kailuan mining area that Japan would be responsible for any war in Qin Port (Fifth Dispatch).</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to foreign sources today, Qinhuangdao now seems as peaceful as before, and the atmosphere is not as tense as before. The Chinese army is still stationed there and has no intention of leaving the country. It is now confirmed that Haiyang County is still in the hands of the Chinese army. There is currently one Japanese patrol ship in Qinhuangdao, one aircraft carrier and two patrol ships outside Yuguan. At the same time, Japanese planes still occasionally scout the Chinese army's lines (Sixth Reuters Report).</p>
<p>(Tianjin) There are currently three Japanese warships anchored between Qinhuangdao and Beidaihe. The situation is tense, but railway personnel are still working as usual (Sixth Reuters Report).</p>

<h3 id="e3">Japanese Side Changes War Plan <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Pomu 16th Division has just arrived from Japan and is being transported to Rehe day and night. The newly formed puppet army has now been sent to Rehe. The new puppet army has established the 3rd Garrison Army, with Huang Xiling as the army commander. The military routes built by the Japanese army in Rehe have been completed. The Japanese side has recently made some changes to its war plan, drawing Suzuki and Hattori's units from outside Xifengkou and sending them to the eastern route to cooperate with the Iwata detachment, Cheng Guorui, Li Jichun, and other puppet troops to make every effort to attack our eastern Luan inside Jiumenkou. The troops of Mogi, Zhang Haipeng, etc. are attacking Duolun. The enemy has set up power grids and built defensive works near Xishuangshan, 50 miles northeast of Lengkou (Sixth Dispatch).</p>
<h3 id="e4">Enemy Troops Discovered Outside Qian'an City <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>

<p>(Beiping) People from Gubeikou talked about how the Japanese army in Gubeikou is no more than 2,000 people, sometimes rushing toward us, and actively building strong trenches. A few days ago, the enemy army forcibly seized more than 200 of our residents, who were forced to bury landmines and erect barbed wire and other obstacles for them day and night. After the installations were completed, our civilians were used to test them. Finally, the Japanese army drove all of our civilians to a mountain ditch and strafed them with machine guns. All were brutally killed. Now, nearby villagers are outraged and are planning to defend themselves to resist the Japanese atrocities (Sixth Dispatch).</p>
<h3 id="e6">Japanese Cavalry Suddenly Arrives at Jianganling <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) In the Jielingkou area, at about 6:00 PM last night, 67 Japanese cavalry suddenly arrived at Zhaziling and Fenchang areas north of Jianganling and drove away the local people, declaring that a large army would arrive. Recently, five or six hundred enemy infantrymen have arrived at various fortresses from the Dushan area. It is expected that the enemy troops in this area seem to be continuing to invade our army. The enemy in front of us harasses our position with small units every night, but they are repelled by our army. The various passes on the Great Wall on the right wing and the Dongbianmen area are all tightly guarded by our army. If the enemy invades, it will be difficult for them to succeed (Sixth Dispatch).</p>
<h3 id="e7">Enemy Planes Fill the Sky Over Eastern Luan <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Formations Bombard, Dropping Bombs Like Rain</p>
<p>Houses Destroyed, Flesh and Blood Sputtered</p>
<p>The Police Chief of Funing Was Shot and Killed</p>
<p>(Luanzhou) From morning to noon on the fifth, enemy planes filled the sky over the counties of eastern Luan. At 2:30 PM, eight enemy planes in formation bombed Qian'an County for an hour, dropping more than 40 bombs, causing terrible damage. Eighteen soldiers and civilians were killed and twenty-eight were injured, and the rest are under investigation. Several bombs hit the county government, but the county magistrate was unharmed. In Funing County, two enemy planes dropped more than ten bombs, killing the police chief and wounding many soldiers and civilians. Five planes came to Nanda Temple Station, scouting north of the station for more than an hour. One plane each came to Lulong and Changli, scouting for several rounds. At noon, one plane came to Luan and circled once (Sixth Dispatch).</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shang Zhen telegraphed to Ping late on the fifth that on the fifth, Japanese planes flew over Qian'an County twice and dropped more than a hundred bombs. Residents of the city gate were suddenly attacked, and flesh and blood flew everywhere, making it unbearable to watch. Houses collapsed and trees fell, killing many people. Qian'an City is not within the war zone, nor is it a concentration point for our troops. The Japanese army failed to attack Lengkou, so they took this last resort. What is the guilt of our people to suffer such a calamity (Fifth Dispatch).</p>
<p>(Beiping) A large number of enemy planes bombed the county towns in the eastern Luan area. Our military and civilians suffered heavy casualties. At Yejiatun in Jianchang, eight enemy planes opened fire on various villages with machine guns for an hour. Countless people were killed and injured. It is estimated that more than 40 bombs were dropped in Jianchang County and more than 20 bombs were dropped in Lulong. Many buildings in the counties were destroyed by the bombing. The provincial government of Hebei has ordered the county magistrates to investigate and report the details (Sixth Dispatch).</p>
<p>(Luanzhou) Five enemy planes bombed Qian'an County again at Shenshi on the sixth, dropping three bombs and injuring three people (Sixth Dispatch).</p>
<p>Linyu: Three or four enemy planes came to Shenhebao several times today to scout, and dropped several bombs on Funing, killing several people. The losses are unknown (Fifth Dispatch).</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Enemy planes scouted in Funing, Lulong, and Qian'an on the sixth and scattered propaganda, warning people to evacuate quickly to avoid being sacrificed by artillery fire (Sixth Dispatch).</p>
<h3 id="e8">Enemy Troops Have Not Entered Chahar Territory <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Duolun and Guyuan Areas</p>
<p>Complex Situation of Stationed Troops, Chaotic</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Zhangyuan reported that fifty to sixty refugees from Duolun and Guyuan fled to Zhangyuan. The Pingduo line has been blocked again, indicating that a major incident has occurred in that area. One party propagated that the troops stationed there are complex, and that the Tang department in western Rehe has concentrated in eastern Chahar. The situation is chaotic, which is true, but enemy troops have not entered Chahar territory, and the situation in eastern Chahar has not reached a serious level (Sixth Dispatch).</p>
<p>(Beiping) Feng Zhanhai telegraphed from Guyuan that his headquarters had received a telegram from the Ping Military Commission, ordering him to defend the line near Guyuan. He had arrived at the designated location today and was constructing fortifications. The original Duolun defense area has been discussed with Commander Zhao Chengsheng, and concrete support measures have been taken. The defense of Duolun is very stable, he reported (Sixth Dispatch).</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying was shot in the right shoulder when he was fighting in Chicheng, but he has now recovered. There is a large, strong militia group of more than a hundred people in the Datanzhen area near Fengning, who have built a solid stone dam in the area and are willing to help the garrison in the anti-Japanese work. The main force of the Jin army has now arrived in Guyuan and is building strong defensive fortifications there. Tang is in Datanzhen, expressing his determination not to be a traitor (Sixth Dispatch).</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying was previously ordered to mobilize his troops to the border area of eastern Chahar to coordinate with other armies. Most of the army has gradually moved to a new front in a certain area. In the Rehe territory, there is still a reserve brigade in the vicinity of □□□ (Sixth Dispatch).</p>

<p>Expressing Sincere Support for the Central Government</p>
<p>(Beiping) Wan Fulin, Yu Xuezong, Wang Shuchang, and others have recently found that unscrupulous people have been spreading leaflets under the name of the Northeast Army, confusing rumors and trying to do something wrong. In addition to the military and political chiefs reporting the situation to the authorities and strictly investigating these leaflet spreaders, the generals are also planning to send a telegram to the country, stating that they will abide by Zhang Xueliang's intentions and sincerely support the central government. Military personnel are required to obey as their duty. At this time of national crisis, these rumors may confuse the public, so we are making this statement to dispel doubts, etc. This telegram is still being discussed and will be officially issued soon (Sixth Dispatch).</p>

<h3 id="e10">Eastern Luan is in Emergency, Duolun is Tense and Ominous <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese army having failed at Xifengkou, turned its fierce attack and utilized Jiumen to launch an attack on Shimen. With a small number of enemy cavalry launching a raid on Haiyangzhen, the current battle is only a contact of front-line sentries, and not a true battle. The 4th Infantry Brigade stationed in Jinzhou has not formally participated in the war, only the independent 3rd Guard Battalion Commander Iwata Fumio, leading more than a thousand people as the main force, is carrying out a flank raid, coupled with the rabble of the puppet state to create disturbances. From our perspective, it may be considered an informal challenge, so a purely defensive posture is taken. If the enemy comes, we respond; if the enemy retreats, we do not pursue. However, the enemy can therefore advance and retreat freely, expanding and contracting at will, while we are in a passive position.</p>
<p>Japan is in the midst of the global economic panic, with conflicts of interest with other countries externally, and the people suffering from hunger and cold internally, creating unrest. The reduction in tax revenue in the past six months and the political and social unrest both indicate internal turmoil. Political, social, and economic cancers are growing daily. If external troubles are not deliberately provoked, the current political disputes could plunge Japan into an irrecoverable position. Therefore, it must aggressively invade, yet not risk the name of war. Since the September 18th Incident, it has spoken of peace and advocated the fallacy of local resolution, both to cover up its own contradictions and to arouse the so-called shared national crisis, and to take advantage of this to ease our country's hatred, in order to achieve its cunning scheme of gradual encroachment. This is one of its advantages. If a formal war were launched, China, although weak, has more than two million soldiers, half of whom are elite soldiers that can be quickly gathered. The people's poverty has become a habit, and their spirit of enduring hardship and bitterness can be said to be the first in the world. With the entire nation engaged in a life-and-death struggle with Japanese militarism, Japan, though fierce, would certainly have no hope of victory. Even if it is prolonged, and our country loses some territory, if we can continue to fight, the final victory will surely belong to our country. Therefore, it is beneficial for Japan to fight with small units, using the old method of creating a diversion to attack from the east and west, with secret plans for piecemeal destruction everywhere. This is the second advantage of its piecemeal invasion.</p>
<p>Japan also understands that our country's internal strength is insufficient, the people lack training, and officials are mostly corrupt, especially in the culturally backward provinces on the border. It is even able to use puppets to bewilder the people and achieve its ambitions. Therefore, it has laid the groundwork in the eastern part of Inner Mongolia, buying off some unscrupulous princes to act as pawns. Although most Mongolians are inclined toward us, they are far away from the central government and cannot do anything. Now their iron cavalry is running wild. The surface claim of not crossing the Great Wall or the Luan River is only a hesitant pause while observing the attitude of Britain, France, and the United States. However, the intention to extend its devilish hand to Inner Mongolia is already clear and needs no further explanation. In the Rehe campaign, the subordinates of those who rely on the puppet state have nowhere to be accommodated. The best way to deal with them is to have them as the advance guard, clashing with our army. Losing in battle is exactly what the Japanese Empire wants to eliminate but finds difficult to do. Using our country's hand to eliminate them, while at the same time causing our country's army to suffer considerable losses. If they win, then our people are the ones who are slaughtered, and our territory is the one that is trampled upon. Japan then reaps the great benefits while sitting back and doing nothing.</p>
<p>At this time, our country must not delay any longer, and especially must not relax one step. To maintain Tianjin and to defend North China, we must maintain Duolun with all our strength. Duolun is the main road into Mongolia, and it is also the vanguard of the PingSui Road, and the barrier of the northwest provinces. As for the inconvenient transportation and rugged roads, both the enemy and we share them. We can take advantage of this inconvenience and use our clumsy detour to strike at the enemy's weaknesses. Moreover, the Japanese army is coming from a long way away. Napoleon's expedition to Russia serves as a historical lesson. The vast desert has only water and grass, which is a natural scorched-earth tactic that can trap the enemy in a desperate situation. Therefore, our people should quickly rise up and fight with the last drop of blood and the last bullet. By defending Duolun to the north and protecting eastern Luan to the east, it is still not difficult to reverse the current dangerous situation and create a new opportunity for the future.</p>

A small group of bandits in southern Henan is being searched and suppressed and can be eliminated soon. I am determined to resist Japan, because at this time, there is no other way but to resist. I was previously ordered to act as the bandit suppression officer of the three provinces, but I did not take office because of the busy affairs of Henan Province. Yang said that Shaanxi Province is very peaceful, and the Red Bandits have fled to Sichuan and are now assisting in the pursuit and suppression.

<p>(Beiping) Feng Yuxiang said to people in Zhangyuan that his consistent position is resistance, and the most important purpose is how to realize the resistance plan. Rumors say that the government will appoint me in some capacity, but I think that the individual capacity is not important, but only seeks to achieve the anti-Japanese desperate purpose. The people and the government, no matter what they want me to do, as long as it is conducive to the anti-Japanese work, I am willing to do it. I have a very close relationship with Chiang. Chiang has repeatedly stated that there is no way to survive without resistance, and messengers have been exchanged many times. As far as my humble opinion is concerned, I should contribute to the anti-Japanese plan to the best of my ability. Therefore, in the anti-Japanese process, I can only help him to complete the anti-Japanese plan as soon as possible (Sixth Dispatch).</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Feng Yuxiang replied to Chiang with a written book, outlining his personal anti-Japanese opinions, generally requesting that 80% of the country's troops be sent to the front line to resist Japan, and that 80% of the country's military spending be used for anti-Japanese purposes, and recommended Li Jishen, Cai Tingkai, Jiang Guangnai, Song Zheyuan, Sun Dianying, Zhang Fakui, and other gentlemen as the vanguard of the anti-Japanese forces (Sixth Dispatch).</p>

<p>(Beiping) The Division Headquarters of the Chaoyang city are located south of the east gate of Nanmen in two locations. The Japanese changed the Chaoyang County Government to the Guidance Department, setting up a guidance officer, a Japanese, to take charge of the county's political affairs. It is divided into three committees: Administration, Judiciary, and Police. The Japanese set up an aircraft factory at Chaoyang South Horse Factory, where they put five biplanes and five monoplanes, which are both combat and transport aircraft, and are guarded by Japanese soldiers. Chaoyang has only more than two hundred Japanese soldiers, and the officers are all Japanese. Most of the soldiers are Korean slaves. Japan has completed the three railways from Beipiao to Chaoyang, which was hastily completed by nearly 10,000 laborers working day and night. The Japanese in various counties in Jinzhou and Suizhong are forcibly sending male children between the ages of five and eight to Japan, and it is not known what they are for (Sixth Dispatch).</p>
<p>(Beiping) When the Japanese entered Chaoyang, residents who bowed to their officials were said to be bad people and were executed. Those who cupped their hands to them were said to be good people. Their way of fooling the people is like this. The slogans posted by the Japanese are: Down with the rebellious bandits, Manchuria-Japan cooperation is the happiness of your people, there are no bandits allowed in Rehe, obeying Manchuria is ascending to heaven, those who do not obey are going to hell, farmers quickly go to the Great Manchuria to enjoy happiness, Japanese soldiers are all from good families who protect the people (Sixth Dispatch).</p>

<p>The Issue of Civil Rights Protection</p>

<p>Captured Communists Should Be Handed Over for Trial Separately</p>
<p>Formulate All Regulations to the Extent That They Do Not Hinder Military Affairs</p>
<p>Fully Protect the People's Freedom of Speech, Publication, and Assembly</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At the Central Standing Committee meeting on the 6th, Wang Jingwei reported on the demands of the China Civil Rights Protection League, represented by Soong Ching-ling and others: 1. Release all political prisoners. The Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee last year had already resolved to implement this, but because the communists in Jiangxi, Hubei, and other places were gathering in rebellion, strict measures had to be taken. If the innocent are implicated as a result, it is also inappropriate. It is proposed to make the following two proposals: A. Communists who are captured and have direct or indirect evidence of endangering military affairs should be handed over to military law for trial. B. Communists who are captured and have acts of riot should be handed over to the court for trial. 2. Regarding the freedom of speech, publication, association, and assembly, the general public already has guarantees, but since the communists are still gathering in rebellion in Jiangxi, Hubei, and other places, all communists may be considered to be directly or indirectly related to the rebellion, so special attention must be paid. It is proposed to make the following two proposals: A. The Central Standing Committee has already resolved to convene a Provisional National Congress to discuss the early convocation of the National Assembly, so it is more appropriate to be lenient on civil rights protection. It is proposed to formulate all regulations to the extent that they do not hinder military affairs, and to fully protect the freedom of speech, publication, association, and assembly of the general public. As for political associations, they will be formulated after the Provisional National Congress decides to convene the National Assembly in advance. B. In the constitutional era, the people have freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and association within the scope that does not harm social order, and communists are no exception. However, since the riots in Jiangxi and Hubei have not yet ended, the matter should be discussed again after the riots are pacified. 3. As for the abolition of special laws, the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee last year had already made a resolution, which was handed over to the legislative, judicial, and administrative organs for separate implementation. Following Ye Chucang and Chen Guofu's reports, the Party Department has not directly arrested or interrogated any of the communists who have been arrested over the years. All executions of reconnaissance and arrests have been carried out by judicial or military police organs in accordance with the law. Therefore, all kinds of rumors from the outside world can be clarified after an on-the-spot investigation. Sun Ke, Zhang Ji, Gu Zhenglun, and other committee members all expressed their opinions on this. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>

When I looked at them, blood was flowing from both feet. I could not help but think of Prime Minister Hamaguchi's incident. Then I thought of the Shanghai Truce Agreement that was in progress, and I must not die. My spirit was strengthened. I do not know much about the recent China issue.

<p>The League of Nations' Strength is Slightly Weaker Due to Japan's Withdrawal</p>
<p>But it is Spiritually Stronger</p>
<p>(London) League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond said in a radio address today that although the League of Nations' strength is slightly weaker due to Japan's withdrawal, it is spiritually stronger because it resolutely responded to its unprecedented and most difficult situation. If Japan had obeyed the League of Nations Covenant earlier and presented its difficulties to the League of Nations, it would have been listened to with sympathy and obtained appropriate measures to fully protect its interests in Manchuria. Unfortunately, the policy adopted by Japan runs counter to the principles advocated by the League of Nations. It is hoped that Japan will reconsider its decision and agree to the Lytton Commission's proposal to maintain peace in the Far East, to be friendly to China, and not to wage war against China. Japan can make a great contribution to the East. The League of Nations is always prepared to assist Japan within the scope of the Covenant. (5th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>To Discuss Important International Issues</p>
<p>Roosevelt Declares Welcome</p>
<p>Reuter, London, 5th – British Prime Minister MacDonald has accepted President Roosevelt's invitation to visit Washington during the Easter period to discuss war debts and economic issues. London is now planning the meeting with the US President. It is learned today that the Prime Minister will leave the UK on April 15th, accompanied by his daughter and financial expert, Mr. Fu.</p>
<p>National, Washington, 5th – US President Roosevelt issued a statement today, stating that during this time when the UK and the US are informally exchanging views on the general economic situation and the war debt issue, he felt that the British Prime Minister's visit to Washington would be of great benefit. He solemnly expressed his hope that the British Prime Minister would come to the US for talks when he first met with British Ambassador Sir Lindsay at the hot springs. The public believes that this statement is sufficient to indicate that President Roosevelt had invited MacDonald to come to the US, but MacDonald had not yet notified the exact date of departure, and Roosevelt hoped that he would come to the US as soon as possible. Therefore, it is expected that a formal statement will be issued soon. The news that MacDonald will come to the US during the Easter holiday is because Congress will have a short recess during Easter, at which time the US government can concentrate on discussing everything with the British Prime Minister, so it is most appropriate for MacDonald to visit the US at this time. It is now speculated that after the British Prime Minister arrives in the US, the disarmament issue will also be discussed.</p>

<p>Havas, Washington, 6th – President Roosevelt recently informed French Ambassador Claudel of British Prime Minister MacDonald's intention to come to the US as soon as possible, and said that he would be very happy if the US and France could hold talks at the same time. Roosevelt's intention seems to be that the future talks should be in the form of a conference of the three countries, the UK, France, and the US, which would be more appropriate. Although Roosevelt has not formally invited the French government to participate in the talks, he is willing to negotiate with French representatives on the preparations for the World Economic Conference, and then begin to discuss general political issues.</p>

<p>National, Paris, 5th – Davis, the US representative to the Disarmament Conference, met with French Prime Minister Daladier today for more than an hour of in-depth discussions. All matters related to the Disarmament Conference and the Four-Power Pact were discussed. After the talks, Daladier immediately convened a cabinet meeting to report on the content of the talks with Davis. It is said that the French cabinet has decided to agree to the US proposal to convene a meeting of experts in Washington as a preliminary step to the future London World Economic Conference. The reason for France's agreement to this proposal is that France can first negotiate with the Washington authorities on the war debt issue when this preliminary meeting is convened.</p>
<p>National, Berlin, 6th – US Representative Davis is expected to arrive here on Saturday and Sunday to meet with Foreign Minister Neurath to discuss disarmament and the World Economic Conference.</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, 6th – Political circles believe that the visit of Davis, the chief representative to the Disarmament Conference, to Berlin is extremely important. They fear that Germany's reorganization of its armaments will cause the Disarmament Conference to fail. They hope that Davis can avoid this. This is the main task of Davis's trip to Europe. Generally, people also believe that economic truce, if Germany can cooperate, it will be of great value.</p>

<p>German Deputy Chancellor to Visit Rome</p>
<p>National, Paris, 6th – France's memorandum on the Four-Power Pact will not be submitted in Rome and London today. According to reports, the reason for the delay is due to opposition from French political circles to the entire plan. All newspapers say that France's memorandum only recognizes that the Four-Power Pact is a regional security agreement and must be included in the League of Nations Covenant. According to the Morning Post, the French government is willing to completely delete the revision of the treaty item from the agreement and replace it with a clause stipulating increased security and prohibiting Germany from re-establishing armaments.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 5th – The State Council met at the Presidential Palace today. Foreign Minister Poncet explained the French memorandum on the British-Italian Four-Power Pact plan, and the main part of it was approved by the State Council. This diplomatic note must be drafted at least two days later. After the State Council adjourned, government officials believed that Foreign Minister Poncet would explain the content of the diplomatic note when the House of Representatives discussed the budget.</p>
<p>Reuter, Berlin, 5th – Deputy Prime Minister von Papen and Speaker of the Reichstag Göring will go to Rome in the next few days to discuss disarmament issues and the Four-Power Pact with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. This news has been officially confirmed today.</p>
<p>National, Berlin, 5th – According to news from the Berlin Daily News, German Deputy Prime Minister von Papen will go to Italy in the next few days to consult with the Pope in Rome on the cooperation between the Catholic Church and the German National Socialist Party. These conditions for reconciliation have been under negotiation between the two sides for a long time. Papen's trip is just to complete the final formalities. Furthermore, German Aviation Minister Göring will also go to Italy to meet with Italian Air Minister Balbo, or perhaps pay homage to Prime Minister Mussolini. Therefore, there are many speculations about the two's trip to Italy. It is said that their trip will be the prelude to a meeting between German Chancellor Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini.</p>

<p>Otherwise, Naval Power Will Be Ranked Fifth</p>
<p>National, Washington, 5th – US House Naval Committee Chairman Vinson stated in the committee today that the US Navy has fallen into a tragic situation. If it does not immediately start building ships, it will be reduced from its current third place in the world naval power to fifth place within three years. As for battleships alone, the United States will be on an equal footing with the United Kingdom. As for other important warships, the United States will be in fifth place by the end of 1936. For example, in terms of light cruisers, the United States will only have ten old ships by then. On the contrary, the United Kingdom will have twenty-one, Japan will have eighteen, and France and Italy will each have twelve. For example, in terms of destroyers, the United States will only have eleven ships by then, while the United Kingdom will have sixty-five, Japan sixty-seven, France fifty-eight, and Italy forty-eight. For example, the submarines that the United States currently has are rapidly becoming old. By 1936, there will only be twenty old ships. On the contrary, the United Kingdom will have thirty-nine, Japan eighty-one, France fifty-four, and Italy forty-seven. Although Vinson has always been known as a large navy faction, most of the committee members agree with this view. Therefore, the committee has decided today to immediately begin a detailed study of the need for shipbuilding and has invited Navy Chief of Staff Swanson to discuss this matter with the committees tomorrow. Vinson also stated that while the US Navy's strength is diminishing due to not building new ships permitted by the treaty, discussing disarmament with the great powers is of little value. Because the United States' failure to build new ships is equivalent to actual disarmament, it is difficult to discuss further reductions.</p>

<p>The Hague Court Rules in Favor of Norway</p>
<p>Reuter, The Hague, 5th – Denmark and Norway have been unable to resolve their dispute over certain parts of Eastern Greenland, so they have asked the Permanent Court of International Justice in The Hague to adjudicate. Today, the court ruled in favor of Denmark by twelve votes to two. When the two countries submitted the case, they stated that they would accept the court's verdict without reservation. The cause of the dispute was that a Norwegian private hunting team landed in Eastern Greenland, raised the Norwegian flag there, and recognized that part of the land belonged to Norway. The Norwegian government later formally recognized this move. The Hague Court has now determined that Norway's occupation of the land violates current law, so it ruled that the land should still belong to Denmark.</p>
<p>National, Oslo, 5th – Norwegian Prime Minister Mowinckel told a news reporter today that Norway has submitted the Eastern Greenland case to the International Court of Justice, and now that the court has ruled in favor of Denmark, the Norwegian government will naturally obey in order to maintain close friendship with the Danish people. He also said that Denmark's economic interests in Eastern Greenland are guaranteed by the 1924 Danish-Norwegian treaty, which will not expire until 1944.</p>

<p>National, Washington, 5th – Today, the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee invited representatives from the State Department and the Department of Justice to attend a meeting to explain the reasons for requesting the enactment of a bill to prohibit the publication of government secret documents. This request was made by the State Department and no explanation was given at the time. Although it has now been hastily passed by both houses of Congress, the Senate was surprised to learn that this case was advocated by Secretary of State Hull personally. Moreover, those who advocated the passage of this case at the time expected that the government's goal was to prohibit the publication of Jett Lauck's book on Japanese diplomatic secrets. However, according to what was heard today, the State Department's move was not solely for this book, so it wants to ask the two departments to explain. However, all committee members believe that in such matters, especially when there is a need to enact laws, the State Department should be absolutely trusted, so their request for an explanation is only to hear the truth and has no other opinions. When the representatives of the two departments attend the meeting to explain, a closed-door meeting will be held to maintain confidentiality. Although Secretary of State Hull said that Congress should legislate to protect US secret codes, there is no claim that US codebooks have been stolen.</p>

<p>National Finance Still Not Out of Emergency State</p>
<p>National, Washington, 5th – The US President issued an executive order today, declaring that the national finance has not yet emerged from the emergency state, and all emergency orders and regulations are still valid. He also reaffirmed the order prohibiting the hoarding of gold coins, bullion, and gold securities, except for those specifically exempted. Those who have gold must send it to the Federal Reserve Bank or its agent before May 1. The gold coins or gold securities that each person keeps for personal use must not exceed one hundred yuan. However, gold legally used for industrial purposes does not need to be handed over, and gold coins collected by antique collectors are also exempt, but only those collected as antiques. Gold coins marked as owned by foreign governments and banks and gold coins approved for transportation are also exempt.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Gold Export Restrictions May Be Relaxed Slightly <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>National, New York, 5th – The National Chamber of Commerce has been investigating the financial situation for a long time, and several of its suggestions have been adopted by the US President, so it occupies a significant position in the US financial policy. Tonight, it also suggested that foreign exchange restrictions should be lifted, as long as it does not conflict with gold export restrictions. It said that it is now necessary to restore the free exchange of gold pounds and other foreign currencies. If this measure is not enough to promote the progress of business, then the value of the US gold dollar will have to be reduced so that foreign countries can buy gold dollars at a lower cost to buy US goods. The committee includes many well-known figures in the business and financial world, such as Rosenwald, Ping Dix, and Rand. They previously suggested banning the transportation of gold and stopping the payment of currency. They still suggest continuing to ban the transportation of gold until the UK and the US can hold a joint meeting to discuss this matter and advocate that efforts to maintain the full price of the gold dollar can be stopped. The joint meeting between the UK and the US should aim at restoring the true gold standard at the same time.</p>

<h3 id="e75">Preparations for Japan's Total War Mobilization (Continued from Part 3) <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>9. Industrial Mobilization and Peacetime Surveys</p>
<p>The survey on industrial mobilization is the responsibility of the Military Demand Survey Committee or the Resource Survey Committee. For many factories, wartime conditions are planned, and they are ordered to conduct surveys from peacetime. Once war breaks out, the first thing is to make these factories immediately engage in the manufacture of military supplies. However, it must be noted here that Japan's industries are mostly biased towards the textile industry and the food industry, while the metal industry, machinery and equipment industry, and chemical industry, which are necessary for the military industry, are relatively sluggish. This is a shortcoming.</p>
<p>Regarding the method of conducting industrial mobilization, if we examine the cases submitted to the parliament since the European War, we seem to be able to divide it into two systems. One is that the government itself does not manage the military supply manufacturing factories, but entrusts it to groups or companies. The other is the method by which the government directly manages the factories. The former is the method adopted by Germany during the Great War, and the latter is the method that France and Italy wanted to carry out or are carrying out after the war. Japan's industrial mobilization law also uses the government's power to manage, use, or requisition factories, so it belongs to the latter.</p>
<p>The requisition of transportation agencies is to be done according to the requisition order. The requisition of transportation agencies is not entirely for industrial mobilization. If it is for military use, the military will requisition it and the military will use it. However, there is a kind of protection car that should be requisitioned according to the Military Protection Car Law and a certain amount of compensation should be paid.</p>
<p>In Germany, it is often heard that the chairs in Berlin parks disappear immediately whenever a war breaks out and are eventually moved into trucks for transporting soldiers. Because there is a budget in advance, the length of the chairs has been decided long ago. And in order to accommodate the war-wounded, there were not enough beds in the train, so benches were used instead. This was also planned in advance. Like this, in order to carry out total mobilization, one should focus on peacetime facilities.</p>
<p>Now the National Defense Women's Association is also gradually becoming popular throughout the country. Each member usually wears a gold ring as a sign of membership. Once the country is in a state of emergency, they must take off their gold rings and donate them to the country. Paper money rises and falls irregularly due to the current price, but gold rings are stable. Such a plan is now underway, so Japanese women each carry a gold ring, and once there is a war, it can immediately increase by hundreds of millions of yuan. This is now being promoted very well. Now, in the Kansai area, the coats, clothes, and hats worn by teachers and students are similar in material to those worn by the military. This is the uniform of schools in the Kyoto area, and it has also been extended to the Osaka area. This is being carried out from the perspective of national total mobilization. In the Osaka clothing factory, you can see the organization of the Clothing Association. Of course, there are soldiers participating in this. Woolen fabric operators and dye operators are all participating. The obvious achievement is that the private sector has continuously produced gray-quality clothing. Even if these things are not carried out for total mobilization, the result is also a kind of peacetime facility for total mobilization. Once a war breaks out, it will be useful immediately. Even if it becomes the cultivation of clothing resources, from the perspective of total mobilization, it can be said that the Clothing Association is carrying out the work of total mobilization. Such things seem to be seen everywhere since the September 18th Incident.</p>
<p>If such things are actively carried out in the mobilization plan, this is a help for the national consensus towards improving national defense power, and it is also a kind of peacetime facility for national total mobilization.</p>
<p>Also, the shape of the cans has also become a certain size for army use. A certain canning company in Hokkaido seems to have completely changed it to a military style.</p>
<p>10. Japan's Lack of Self-Sufficiency</p>
<p>Speaking of Japan's ability to have self-sufficient national power, it must go through a considerable amount of time. So, in the current state of Japan, once a war starts, there is no ability to be self-sufficient immediately. This path of self-sufficiency is now underway. If a war starts now, the first thing we immediately feel is the lack of oil. Although we also have oil fields in Manchuria and Sakhalin that can be developed, other important resources for national defense can also be supplied from Manchuria. However, oil cannot be obtained immediately after it is mined, so the current state of Japan cannot be self-sufficient no matter what. The most felt is the lack of oil. How to enable oil to be self-sufficient to some extent in the country is a big problem. Now, a lot of oil is imported from the United States. If it can be continuously imported from the United States as usual, then there is no problem. If we encounter a situation where we cannot rely on the United States, we must think of another way. In addition, we can also rely on oil from the South Seas or Russia, or find a way to import it from Europe. However, the feasibility of its implementation only depends on our careful planning and peacetime preparation. Otherwise, it is very difficult in practice.</p>
<p>11. Is Japan's War Expenditure Sufficient?</p>
<p>However, on the one hand, the most worrying thing is the issue of money for using resources. This is about the question of how much money will be needed for the future war. In total, 500 to 600 million is needed a year. If it continues for two years, 100 to 100 million is needed. This is only the number needed by the army. The country must need more. However, looking at past wars, the issue of war expenditure, an increase in taxes is only a part of the war expenditure. The main force of war expenditure should be based on public bonds and non-convertible paper money. The problem of money is not a problem if we win the war. If we lose the war, it is terrible. Germany lost, and one trillion marks plummeted to five cents. If Japan loses the war, it will be terrible. Every Japanese citizen believes that the difficulty when a war starts is the problem of resources, and especially the difficulty is money.</p>
<h3 id="e76">The Tragic State of Jianchang Camp After the Japanese Plane Bombing <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Each Bomb Weighed Over 240 Pounds</p>
<p>No Land Intact Within the City, Many Deaths</p>
<p>Refugees Claim Japanese Soldiers Committed Rape and Murder at Will</p>
<p>A Tangshan dispatch: Yang Letian, an executive member of the Tangshan City Party Department, returned yesterday from Qian'an. He spoke of the devastating bombing by Japanese planes in the Lengkou Jianchang Camp area, a situation too terrible to bear. The following is a record of Yang's account:</p>
<p>"Currently, at Xifengkou North and various other passes, the enemy and our troops are confronting each other both inside and outside the passes. However, Dongjiakou, east of Xifengkou, is now occupied by the enemy.</p>
<p>The [missing characters] army units are mostly stationed in the Xiaojiaying and Madaogou areas, more than twenty miles outside Lengkou, constructing strong defensive works and maintaining strict vigilance. They are also facing each other. Both enemy and our positions are on the mountains, but the enemy's mountain is higher than ours. They constantly shoot at us with machine guns. Our soldiers have high morale and ignore the enemy's aimless firing. They wait for the enemy to get close, then launch fierce attacks with broadswords and hand grenades. Every attack hits its mark, and every swing of the sword finds its target. Enemy planes constantly drop bombs on various villages inside and outside Lengkou, causing great damage. Jianchang Camp was the most severely bombed, with hardly any land intact within the city. Judging from the extent of the explosions, the bombs weighed over 240 pounds each. For example, a bomb dropped in front of the Yuqingyong store on East Street not only destroyed the building and created a large crater, but also blasted a two-foot square flagstone into the air, landing it on the roof of a house on the north side of the street. The soil blasted from the crater could level the surrounding buildings, and after the buildings next to the crater were bombed a second time and collapsed into the crater, the crater was still over ten feet deep. The cruelty of the Japanese is unmatched. A bomb dropped inside the Catholic Church on North Street killed two people, including a priest, it is said. Four people died in the east neighbor, and two people died in the west neighbor. The Shunxing store on West Street was also hit by a bomb, killing and injuring one person each, and also killing a donkey. One person was killed at the Little West Gate. The Yuan Rong residence in Xiguan was bombed, killing two men and one woman. The fate of the children is unknown. The Yuqingyong, Yongshenglong, Fuji, Yong Sheng He, and Xu Zhang residences on East Street were all hit by multiple bombs, and the casualties are unclear. The Zhao Family Inn, Haiji Pawnshop, Li Residence on South Street, as well as the houses on both sides of the city wall and gate in Nanguan, were all destroyed by bombs. Three houses were destroyed in Wang Family Shop in Nanguan, with no trace of bricks and tiles, only a large crater.</p>
<p>Currently, the residents of Jianchang Camp have all fled. It is said that although there has been no detailed investigation of the number of people killed by the bombing, it is known that there are already more than thirty people. On the 30th of last month, eleven enemy planes bombed Baiyangluokou on a large scale. The extent of the bombing is currently unknown.</p>
<p>According to refugees who escaped from Dushan, there are many Mongolians and Koreans in the Japanese army, but few Chinese. Several are translators. The Japanese are extremely cruel to the Chinese. Once Chinese land is occupied, they want to kill all intellectuals to eliminate future troubles. Therefore, whenever they encounter men with long robes and delicate hands, resembling literate men, they kill them without asking questions. Whenever they see people with rough clothes and dirty faces, short, hard fingers, and braids hanging down their backs, the Japanese always say "Good, good." As for women, their suffering is beyond words. It is not easy to endure humiliation and survive, and it is difficult to seek death. The Japanese openly commit rape, and almost all women are humiliated. They also occasionally give small favors to the villagers to win their hearts. They forcibly search and burn books in schools and civilian homes.</p>
<p>The Japanese rely entirely on modern weapons to fight against us. In fact, the Japanese soldiers have very little courage and are most afraid of our army's broadswords. They say that if they are killed by broadswords, they cannot be reincarnated as human beings in the next life. Therefore, everyone wears two or three amulets to ensure they will not die or be reborn as human beings after death. Their cowardice and ignorance prove the extreme wickedness of the Japanese warlords. The text on their amulets reads "戸户神社 (May martial luck last forever) Amulet" and "天津日高彦火歹出見命御守". The character "神" (God) in the former and the characters "高彦" (Takihiko) in the latter both have red seals stamped on them, but the characters are unclear. The characters on the amulets are also very neatly written." (April 2nd)</p>

<p>Soldiers Selected by Drawing Lots</p>
<p>Those Selected Rejoice, Those Not Selected Are Disappointed</p>
<p>A Fuzhou dispatch: Cai Tingkai, Commander-in-Chief of the 19th Route Army, flew from the province to Zhangzhou on the afternoon of March 30th to prepare for sending troops to aid Rehe. Zhang Yan and Tan Qixiu had previously been rumored to be appointed as commanders of the aid-Rehe army columns and had already gone to Guangdong to make arrangements. As for the 19th Route Army's plan to send troops, it was originally planned to select twelve people from each company to form [missing character] regiment. Soldiers who volunteered to go filled out application forms and waited to be selected. However, after this order was issued, soldiers competed to go, and some entire companies even submitted applications, making it impossible for the regimental headquarters to select. Therefore, they decided to use drawing lots to decide. Those who were selected were all joyful and excited, while those who were not selected were very disappointed. The troops stationed in northern Fujian have now been fully selected and organized and are marching empty-handed to Zhangzhou to receive new, sharp firearms. They will join the troops selected in southern Fujian and go north to Guangdong. All sectors of Yong'an specially held a large meeting the other day to bid them farewell and presented them with a satin banner that read "Kill the Enemy for the Country" as a memento. At that time, a soldier representing the entire group took the stage and gave a speech that was extremely tragic. He said that they would go with the determination to die without returning and fight the enemy to the end. He only hoped that those who followed could step on the heads and blood of those who went before and advance forward, and that they would not look back until they had achieved the goal of recovering lost territory. The audience was deeply moved. In addition to holding a large anti-Japanese national salvation donation drive from the 1st to the 3rd, raising funds to purchase items for comfort, the male and female students of the normal and vocational middle schools in Fuzhou also launched the organization of an ambulance team. The various procedures have now been roughly prepared, and they are scheduled to go to Zhangzhou after the spring vacation and depart with the army. In addition, the Pacification Headquarters had previously issued a notice to the counties to raise and transport teams. Now, more than 1,900 people have been sent from the counties and will be divided into 36 classes, exclusively for bandit suppression. Outside rumors that they will also go north with the army are not true. Regarding the news of bandit suppression on the Fujian border, after the bandit army in Changting was attacked by the three divisions of Qu Shounian, Shen Guanghan, and Huang Renhuan, divided from Liancheng, Shanghang, and Nanyang, their situation became increasingly desperate. Now, only Li Shaozhou's false independent regiment remains in Ting City, and the rest have fled back to Ruijin. (April 3rd)</p>

<p>Xu Fengshan, the leader of the investigation team of the Songhu Bandit Suppression Headquarters, was recently accused by Zhou and others in a petition to the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Department of Civil Affairs, accusing him of privately colluding with bandit gangs, abusing investigators, engaging in private corruption, and opening classes to accept disciples. They requested a thorough investigation and prosecution. The Jiangsu Provincial Government secretly ordered the Wuxian County Government on the 6th to investigate and report the matter in detail for verification. It is said that the reason for the accusation is that Wu Xiaonan, the head of the investigation team, was originally a well-known gambler in Suzhou. Recently, he shot and injured Du A'er with a handgun over a trivial matter and fled without a trace. Wu is a disciple of Xu Fengshan. There is also Chen Zhengxiang, who claims to be an investigator of the team, who defrauded Ge of 100 yuan at the New Suzhou Hotel.</p>

At that time, he was suspected of being a communist bandit and was sent to the Suzhou High Court for investigation, where he was declared innocent. However, regarding the robbery and arson in Xinjie, the suspect confessed and there was material evidence, so the case was sent back to the county court for clear investigation and public prosecution. After repeated inquiries and final conclusion, Judge Zhang announced the verdict yesterday, sentencing Wu Qinghe to life imprisonment for robbery, arson, murder, and other acts in Xinjie.</p>

<p>Qian Xingsheng's son, a villager from Qianjia Wooden Bridge, Jingyun City, Bai Mu Township, Second District of the county, recently had a dispute with Qian A'pei over the issue of a base. After repeated negotiations, no solution was reached. At 8:00 AM yesterday morning, Qian's son went to A'pei's house to argue again. A'pei was out on business at the time, so his wife, Madam Mou, came out to deal with him. A misunderstanding arose during the conversation, leading to a quarrel. Qian's son, in a fit of anger, raised an iron bar and struck Madam Mou three times, causing her to fall to the ground and die instantly. The murderer, realizing the trouble he had caused, immediately fled. After the incident, the deceased's husband, Qian A'pei, returned home after learning the news and was grief-stricken to see his wife's tragic death. He carried the body to Qian Xingsheng's house and started a major dispute. He reported the information to Meng Yangsu, the head of the township, and Hang Deyu, the ward leader, asking them to report the matter to the county court for an autopsy and to arrest the murderer. Meng and Hang received the report and decided to come to the city this morning to petition the county court for an autopsy.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction, in order to consolidate the foundation of construction in the province, is preparing to establish a construction bank and has issued an order to the counties to pool funds for development. The department planned to open the bank at the end of April, but the funds paid by the counties are very few.</p>
<p>Now that administrative inspector commissioners are being established throughout the province, the Construction Department has drafted three types of limited payment methods and issued an order to each commissioner to strictly comply with them. The regulations stipulate that first-class counties pay 8,000 yuan, second-class counties 5,000 yuan, and third-class counties 3,000 yuan. In any case, the funds must be pooled and presented to the department by the end of this month, and a decision will be made to open the bank in mid-May. Once the funds are raised, the bank's address will be built on the vacant land next to the Construction Department.</p>

<p>Three bandit boats suddenly arrived in Wangjiazhuang, Tenth District of the county, at around 6:00 PM the day before yesterday, carrying more than 30 bandits. Among them, seven or eight people were armed with guns, while the rest of the bandits were carrying wooden sticks and sharp blades. They rushed ashore, intending to loot the entire village. Many of the residents of the village are wealthy and have self-defense guns. When the villagers saw the bandits landing, they used their self-defense guns to resist the bandits. Seeing that the situation was not good, the bandits re-boarded their original boats and quickly fled. The villagers are afraid that the bandits will return, so they have organized a patrol team to patrol every night to prevent accidents.</p>

<h3 id="e92">Meeting of Foreign Banks <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Foreign banks held a joint meeting at the Chartered Bank on the Bund at 4:00 PM yesterday. Representatives from HSBC, Chartered, Citibank, Banque de l'Indochine, Yokohama Specie Bank, Mitsui Bank, Bank of Taiwan, and Banque Belge pour l'Étranger attended. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM. A reporter from the New Sound Society visited a deputy comprador of the Chartered Bank last night. According to him, the joint meeting of foreign banks resolved two items: (1) The receipt and delivery of silver taels and silver dollars between foreign banks will continue as before; (2) The receipt and delivery of silver taels from Chinese banks and money shops will be calculated in silver dollars.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Foreign Merchants Temporarily Continue to Use Silver <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reports that the Ministry of Finance's telegram ordering the implementation of abolishing taels and changing to yuan today (6th) should, in theory, be binding on all foreign banks. However, according to a Mr. from the American Far East Bank this morning, foreign banks will temporarily continue to use silver. Foreign bankers initially did not expect the silver dollar to become the sole legal tender so quickly. They were shocked by the sudden implementation of abolishing taels in one night. Therefore, they will temporarily continue to use silver taels for transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e94">All Industries Implement Abolishing Taels <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>After the silver and money industries were ordered to implement abolishing taels and changing to yuan, the banks and money shops yesterday stopped issuing silver tael notes. All silver tael notes issued before April 6th were annotated on the back with the amount of silver dollars converted at a rate of 715 thousandths of a silver dollar upon receipt and delivery. All silver tael calculations for various business clients were converted to silver dollars. The receipt and delivery of silver taels from foreign banks was changed to be calculated in silver dollars. Starting today, the Banking Association will handle the registration of long-term silver tael notes that mature after April 15th. As for foreign exchange transactions, silver dollar notes will be used for receipt and payment.</p>

<p>The Preparatory Committee of the Joint Association of Banking Associations issued a notice yesterday: "To whom it may concern, the Banking Association of this city received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance today stating that, starting April 6th, all public and private funds, contracts, notes, and transactions must be converted to silver dollars and silver taels may no longer be used. The association has immediately resolved three implementation methods and sent them for publication in the newspaper. Based on the above regulations, this association has decided that: (1) The exchange of silver taels and silver tael drafts by this association will be abolished starting April 6th; (2) Starting April 6th, for silver taels and silver tael drafts received by the exchange bank that were issued before April 6th, each note should be converted into silver dollars and silver dollar drafts at the legal rate of 715 thousandths of a silver dollar, and the converted amount should be indicated on the note in red numbers before being presented for exchange; (3) If there are silver tael and silver tael draft accounts with business clients of the exchange bank, this association will transfer them to silver dollar and silver dollar draft accounts at the legal rate of 715 thousandths of a silver dollar on April 6th. In addition to notifying the exchange, this notice is hereby sent to you for your information. The Money Industry Association's interbank single (i.e., note exchange) will abolish silver tael singles and only handle silver dollar singles starting yesterday.</p>

<p>The Silver Taels and Silver Dollars Exchange Management Committee, jointly formed by the Central, China, and Communications Banks under the order of the Ministry of Finance, was established on March 10th and began operations. Yesterday, it received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance: "To the Silver Taels and Silver Dollars Exchange Management Committee: This ministry has decided that, starting April 6th, all public and private funds and transactions must be converted to silver dollars and silver taels may no longer be used. As for the exchange of silver taels and silver dollars, it is no longer necessary to continue operations. You are hereby ordered to abolish and cease the exchange operations immediately. Minister of Finance Song Ziwen." After receiving the order, the committee immediately proceeded with the closure. The attached office of the Central Bank has ceased the exchange operations since yesterday.</p>

<p>Song Ziwen Talks</p>
<p>My Resignation as President of the Central Bank is an Active Assumption of Responsibility</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Coordinates the Overall Situation and Strives for Economic Construction</p>
<p>The Foundation of the Central Bank is Solid and Can Be Further Developed</p>
<p>丨Song Visited Kong Yesterday Morning to Urge Him to Serve as President, But Kong Firmly Declined丨</p>
<p>Song Ziwen, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, left Nanjing by overnight train the night before last and arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. He immediately returned to his private residence on Route Américan and went to the Shanghai office to work. At around 9:00 AM, Liu Hongsheng, General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and Mao Bangchu, Principal of the Aviation School, visited him one after another. At 11:00 AM, Song visited Kong Xiangxi to urge him to serve as President of the Central Bank and share the arduous task. Kong politely declined, telling reporters that he was not qualified for the job and would definitely not accept it. The following is a record of the speeches of the two:</p>
<h3 id="e98">Song's Speech <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Active Responsibility: There have been rumors recently that someone in charge of military affairs is unwilling to expand military operations against Japan, so Song has expressed negativity and is tired of his duties. A reporter from the New Sound Society specially visited Song at 10:00 AM this morning to inquire about the matter. Song replied that there was no such thing. The origin of this rumor must be due to the speculation surrounding my resignation as President of the Central Bank. In fact, my resignation as President of the Central Bank is precisely to actively assume responsibility. There are three reasons:</p>
<p>The Foundation is Solid: In the early days of the Central Bank's establishment, due to the initial organization and the unsteady foundation, the Minister of Finance had to serve concurrently. Over the years, it has gone through major and dangerous environments such as internal strife, floods, foreign humiliation, and falling silver prices, but the Central Bank has remained unaffected. Now the foundation is very solid, and business development no longer needs to be handled by me concurrently. This is one reason. Overall Consideration: As Minister of Finance, in terms of my responsibilities, I should take into account the maintenance and adjustment of the national financial economy as a whole. Serving concurrently as President of the Central Bank would create the appearance of favoring one bank and neglecting the overall situation, which is inconvenient. This is the second reason.</p>
<p>Economic Construction: The most important thing in finance today is to plan wartime military spending, but economic construction cannot be ignored. The economy is the foundation of the country, and our country's current situation is very immature and backward. If we do not catch up quickly and only make plans for stopgap measures, there will inevitably be a day when we run out of resources. I plan to devote myself to this in the future, but the organization of the Central Bank is becoming increasingly complex, and it is difficult to take care of both. This is the third reason.</p>
<p>Maintaining the Status Quo: Based on these three reasons, after I resigned as President of the Central Bank, President Wang recommended former Minister Kong to succeed me. There have been no changes to the supervisors of the Central Bank, and all policies will remain the same. In the future, the Ministry of Finance will, of course, fulfill its full responsibility for maintaining the Central Bank and achieve the effect of working together. With someone in charge, it can be further developed.</p>
<p>No Compromise: As for Chiang Kai-shek's trip to Nanchang, it was because the communist bandits in Jiangxi Province were rampant that he had to go there personally, and it was definitely not to relax the war in North China. Rumors that someone advocated compromise are pure speculation. I repeat this to make it clear. No one in the government or the central government is willing to be a Li Hongzhang. Other political issues are not for me to express, as I have already resigned from my position in the Executive Yuan. According to customs news, there is fighting five miles north of Qinhuangdao in the North China war.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Kong's Speech <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Expressing His Refusal: Kong Xiangxi told a reporter from the Central News Agency after meeting with Minister Song that Minister Song had resigned from his position as President of the Central Bank due to busy schedules, and the Central Political Conference had resolved to appoint him as his successor. However, I have not yet received a formal order, so I cannot express whether or not I will accept the position. Taking a step back, even if the central government formally appoints me as the president of the bank, I will definitely refuse to accept the position. The Central Bank is a national bank, and its scale is huge. Only those with scholarship and experience like Minister Song can be competent. I have shallow scholarship and lack experience in managing banks. I feel that I am not competent for this important national financial institution. When I was Minister of Industry in the past, I founded the National Goods Bank, but the National Goods Bank was smaller in scale and easier to manage, which is different from this. At this time of national crisis and China's financial recession, all Chinese people should share the arduous task, but one must know that those who are skilled in craftsmanship are not good at farming, and those who are farmers are not good at being merchants. If one tries to force oneself, one will not be able to do it. Therefore, my expression of not accepting the position is just this meaning.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Song Zheyuan's Representative Reports on the Bloody Battle at Xifengkou <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Receiving the Press at the YMCA Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>All the Officers and Soldiers of the Army Hold the Determination Not to Retreat Until Death</p>
<p>Hope that the National Army Will Rise Up to Recover Lost Territory</p>
<p>Xiao Zhenying, the representative of Song Zheyuan, the Commander-in-Chief of the Third Army Group and concurrently the Commander of the Twenty-Ninth Army, accompanied by Sun Longji, the representative of the army stationed in Shanghai, received the local press at the ninth floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA at twelve o'clock yesterday afternoon, reporting on the army's battle against the enemy at Xifengkou. More than forty reporters from various newspapers attended. Xiao and Sun detailed the desperate battle against the enemy, which was so passionate and tragic that all the reporters were moved. The details are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3 id="e101">The Big Sword for Slaying Enemies <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, after the reporters arrived one after another, Mr. Xiao and Mr. Sun, the two representatives, displayed three types of photographs of war trophies from the victory of their army at Xifengkou, as well as a diagram depicting the army's flanking maneuver to encircle and kill the enemy. The photos included steel armored vehicles, Junkers aircraft, military flags, military caps, and more. Subsequently, they displayed a large sword used for killing enemies, with fresh bloodstains on it. They stated that this sword had already killed more than ten enemies on the front lines. When Mr. Kong Xiangxi visited Xifengkou previously, he specially brought it to Shanghai as a memento. In addition, there were more than ten absurd proclamations from the enemy's command headquarters, and two satirical drawings.</p>
<h3 id="e102">A Detailed Account of the Bloody Battle <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>During the gathering, Mr. Xiao Zhenying, the representative, first reported, "Our army's actions in killing the enemy at Xifengkou were truly the duty of soldiers, and not worthy of praise. However, we are grateful for the encouragement of national public opinion and the added support from all sides. We would like to express our deepest gratitude. To ensure that all sectors understand the overall situation of this defensive battle, we are taking advantage of today's gathering to provide some supplementary details. In today's world, the tools of war are becoming increasingly scientific. Aircraft and cannons are the tools of victory. Our army, lacking equipment, wants to compete with others. We feel that flesh and blood cannot be 'scientified,' and our hands and feet cannot be turned into cannonballs. Thinking about this, the situation is indeed vastly different, and we would be defeated before the battle even begins. How can we talk about resistance? But the reality is not entirely so. Based on the experience gained from our army's battle, we know that victory does not depend entirely on sophisticated weapons and equipment. It is only when the spirit is strong that the battle can be won." At this point, Mr. Xiao produced a battle map of Xifengkou and hung it on the wall, continuing to describe the situation of the bloody battle at the time. "When the Northeast Army began to withdraw on March 8th, it had withdrawn to Xifengkou by the 9th. The Japanese army followed closely behind, arriving at Xifengkou within three hours. At that time, Army Commander Song was stationed in Zunhua, sixty miles east of Xifengkou. The Japanese army arrived successively and occupied the high mountain positions in and outside of Xifengkou, placing eighteen cannons at Heishan Mouth. Our army rushed to support at a rate of twenty miles per hour. The Japanese army, positioned high above, bombarded us with artillery fire. The two companies of our army's vanguard were completely wiped out. Two more companies were sent forward, but only a dozen or so survived. At the same time, Brigade Commander Zhao used the telephone to ask Army Commander Song for instructions. Song believed that if Xifengkou was lost, Tianjin and Beijing would be in danger. He repeatedly ordered that they advance without retreat, and fight to the death. He personally went to the front line to supervise the battle. After three days and nights of bloody fighting, our army had suffered 2,000 casualties due to the terrain. A cadre meeting was then convened. Army Commander Song said that the enemy occupied superior geographical positions, making it very difficult to attack. We would have to resort to unconventional tactics to win. Therefore, it was decided to implement a large-scale encirclement, dispatching Brigade Commanders Zhao Dengyu, Wang Zhibang, and Tong Zeguang to divide their troops into three routes, encircling the rear of the enemy. At that time, Brigade Commander Zhao had not fully recovered from his leg injury, and many advised him not to go. Zhao jumped out of bed and declared, 'Now is the time for men to serve their country! Why hesitate?' He advanced despite his injury. Overnight, they completely surrounded the enemy. It was at night, with close-quarters combat. The enemy could not distinguish between reality and illusion, and they killed each other, collapsing without forming ranks. In this battle, all the enemy units stationed from Xifengkou to Hengcheng to Baozi, and north to Langdongzi, were annihilated, totaling about 10,000 men. When the fighting was intense, more than sixty civilians acted as guides, burning all of the enemy's supply train at Caijia Ridge, so that the fire lit up the sky. The surrounded enemy then recognized the truth. When they tried to bombard our position with artillery, our army had already changed the enemy's position into our own. In this battle, Brigade Commander Zhao Dengyu and Regiment Commander Li Zenzhong were the bravest, advancing despite their injuries, so they could inspire the morale and achieve this success. If Brigade Commander Wang Zhibang had not arrived an hour late due to the distance, and if it were not for the fire at Caijia Ridge, our army would have followed the advance directly to Chengde. Now our army's position is secure, and there are no enemy traces fifty miles away. The Japanese army is indeed afraid of the bravery of our big sword teams."</p>
<h3 id="e103">Soldiers Should Sacrifice <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Before the whole army resisted, Army Commander Song had instructed the soldiers, "Our country now has no other way out except to resist and sacrifice. And those who should first resolve to sacrifice are our soldiers. Japan's strength came from the Russo-Japanese War. In one battle, they advanced to occupy a ridge, sacrificing more than 5,000 men. If Japan had not made sacrifices at that time, how could it have the strength of today, and further invade our China? At that time, the disparity in strength between Japan and Russia was vast, but Japan won by fighting to the death and sacrificing. Therefore, our country's soldiers, at this time, should also fight to the death to the end. If there is one soldier left, we will never retreat, to avenge the entire nation and be the first to advocate for all the country's soldiers." At that time, the soldiers all unanimously expressed their willingness to kill the enemy and sacrifice. He continued, "Our army is hosting you today, not to boast about the battle, nor to flaunt the success of a single battle. The purpose is to hope that you can advise all the country's soldiers. From the Shanghai War and the Xifengkou War, we can see that the Japanese army relies only on aircraft, cannons, and other sophisticated weapons. But their strength can only extend to destruction. In true close-quarters combat, the Japanese army is actually inferior to us. As long as the country's soldiers can prepare to sacrifice, they will surely be able to avenge the national shame and recover the lost territories."</p>
<h3 id="e104">Report by Representative Sun <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>After Mr. Xiao's report, Mr. Sun Longji, the representative of Mr. Song, also reported on the army's sincere attitude towards defending the country, saying that after the Japanese occupied Shenyang on September 18th, the people of the whole country believed that the Japanese army was strong and that it would be difficult for us to resist in any way. However, since the Shanghai War on January 28th, our 19th Route Army resisted the Japanese with sincerity, repeatedly defeating strong enemies, sweeping away the previous demoralization. The soldiers of the whole country have also realized that as long as they resist desperately, they can destroy the tyranny. Army Commander Song has been advocating for active resistance. When the 19th Route Army was carrying out the war of resistance in Shanghai, Mr. Song specially sent four senior staff officers to Shanghai to inspect. Based on the experience gained from the inspection, they trained the soldiers. Therefore, in this battle, all the soldiers of our army were inspired to resist the enemy's strong weapons with our flesh and blood, and finally recovered the lost Xifengkou, ensuring the safety of the gateway to North China. Up to now, there are no enemy traces fifty miles away, and our army also goes on the offensive from time to time. In this battle, our army gained a lot. Just for machine guns, we have more than a thousand. Other items such as cannons are even harder to count. When the news of the victory came out, the British, American, and French embassies in China all sent military attachés to inspect. They were impressed by the bravery of our army, but also felt confused. Our army's chief of staff explained the truth of the battle, saying that the Japanese army's aircraft and cannons can only be used for destruction and long-range trench warfare. In close-quarters combat, they completely lose their effectiveness. Our army uses broadswords in combat. Although machine guns are like a string of pearls, they still have a chance to rest. Our army takes advantage of this to send one or two people to the front line. The enemy is cut down by the broadswords, and the machine guns are seized by us, ultimately winning the final victory. Currently, our army is firmly guarding the front line. Soldiers and officers are all determined to sacrifice, and we will never give up an inch of land. Hosting you today is not to boast about the victory, but just to briefly report the truth, so that the country's soldiers can rise up and recover the lost territories.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Talk by Li Weishi, American Advisor to the Chinese Delegation to the League of Nations <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>China Has Gained International Sympathy</p>
<p>Justice Will Eventually Prevail After a Long Time</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that Dr. Li Weishi, an American advisor to the Chinese delegation to the League of Nations in Geneva, arrived in Shanghai on the President Jefferson on Tuesday night. A reporter specially visited him to inquire about the situation in Geneva. He said that Yan Huiqing, Gu Weijun, Guo Taiqi, and other representatives of China displayed their talents on the diplomatic stage, and finally made the League of Nations General Assembly publish a judgment condemning the Japanese aggression, which is worthy of pride. The three representatives presented facts and analyzed legal principles in Geneva, which were precise and touched on the key points, and were able to gain the trust of politicians and diplomats from the forty countries attending the League of Nations General Assembly. After careful investigation and thorough discussion, they finally recognized that the statements made by the Chinese representatives were true. This judgment, which maintained China's sovereignty in Manchuria, can be regarded as a great spiritual victory for China. Therefore, China now occupies a leading position in the world, and at the same time, it can be regarded as the greatest achievement in international law. At the beginning, there were rumors that since the case involved a strong country, the League of Nations would deviate from justice and demean itself to please Japan. Now, after the League of Nations General Assembly adopted the report of the Committee of Nineteen, clearly designating the aggressor, all rumors have been refuted. Afterwards, the reporter raised two questions: Since the League of Nations has shown courage, maintained justice, and helped China, what will be the next step? Will it impose sanctions to punish the Japanese? Mr. Li did not answer directly, but asked the reporter, "Why has Japan's heavy industry been working day and night since last summer?" He also said that China has obtained one of the world's strongest social essences, which cannot be used to expect immediate gains, but can win the final victory. He firmly believes that justice will eventually prevail after a long time. Mr. Li also said that he is currently compiling the final report to be submitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and will go to Beijing as soon as it is completed. According to reports, Mr. Li served as Gu Weijun's advisor when the League of Nations investigation team came to the East to investigate last year, and accompanied him to Manchuria, knowing the truth about the Manchurian case. He then went to Geneva in November to serve as an advisor to the Chinese delegation. At the beginning of this year, he went to the United States from Geneva due to important tasks, and is now coming to Shanghai from the United States.</p>

<p>Designated Bank Custody</p>
<p>Strictly Regulate Usage</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed all chambers of commerce and overseas Chinese chambers of commerce yesterday, stating that the chamber is concerned that foreign troubles are becoming increasingly urgent, and the loss of territory is expanding daily. It is necessary to quickly plan to enrich the air force, assist the righteous men in the Northeast, restrain the Beijing area, make the Japanese enemies exhausted, and prepare military supplies for the anti-Japanese soldiers in North China to increase their combat power. Otherwise, the disaster of aggression will spread to the whole country and cause an unmanageable situation. Therefore, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Aviation Save-the-Nation Donation Custody Committee and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Fundraising and Rescue Northeast Donation Office are established to concentrate the strength of the business community and jointly seek to resist insults. Aviation donations and rescue Northeast donations are designated to be stored and managed by reliable banks and money shops. In the future, if there is no need to purchase aircraft, the aviation donations will be refunded in full to show good faith. The donations to rescue the Northeast will also be strictly regulated and limited to necessary uses, and appropriate arrangements will be made. In short, the money obtained through hard work must be used for the actual purpose of saving the country and resisting insults, and not a penny will be wasted to live up to the people of the country. This should be a firm statement to the donors. Foreign troubles are pressing, and it is urgent. Collecting more money is to enrich the effect of resisting insults by one point. I hope that you gentlemen will quickly plan for it. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce bows and asks for contributions.</p>

During the banquet, Mr. Wu Zhihao, General Zhu, and Representative Xiao gave heartfelt speeches and raised 13,360 yuan in national currency and 150 sets of woolen pants on the spot to aid the Northeast refugees and the volunteer army. The speeches are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Wu Zhihao said that the significance of hosting a banquet for General Zhu, Representative Xiao, and all of you gentlemen today is twofold. First, from the perspective of the people, to express our gratitude to General Zhu for his meritorious service in traveling around the country and working hard for the country, and to admire the soldiers of Commander Song Zheyuan, represented by Mr. Xiao, who repelled the enemy army with big swords at Xifengkou last month, and whose spirit of sacrifice is especially admirable. Second, there are many wounded soldiers on the front lines, and the refugees are crowded together, and all supplies are lacking. We, the people in the rear, should try to provide assistance so that the frontline soldiers can make persistent efforts and resist to the end. All my colleagues who are willing to donate money for assistance can take it to the north with General Zhu before he leaves Shanghai, or General Zhu can choose to purchase urgently needed items and transport them to the front.</p>
<p>Representative Xiao reported on the glorious battle of the 29th Army at Xifengkou, saying that before our army responded, the enemy army had already attacked the important mountainous areas around Xifengkou, occupying high ground and using the cover of artillery and tanks to bombard and rush at our positions. The situation was fierce and dangerous. Our 29th Route Army, with its incomplete guns and equipment, felt that it would be difficult to cope with. At this time, Commander Song gathered all the generals and soldiers and gave a speech, saying, "Japan's strength was created by 20,000 brave men sacrificing in hand-to-hand combat in the Russo-Japanese War. If our 40,000 brothers are willing to sacrifice their blood, we can turn China from weak to strong. Moreover, we were fortunate not to die in the civil war. Today, we die for the country, and our descendants will be citizens of a strong country." When the whole army heard this, they were all righteous and eager to be in the vanguard. The eight-character military order of "Advance Without Retreat, Death is the End" was issued on the spot, and the entire big sword team was led by Brigade Commander Zhao, who accepted the order despite his injuries and set off on a detour around Tie Menguan and somewhere else. In the dark night, they hurried and rushed past the enemy's front line, reaching the heavy artillery team's position, using the fire in the four fields as a signal, and advancing on three sides at the same time, using broadswords to attack and kill. After repeated victories, the Japanese enemies encountered this strong enemy and were at a loss. Therefore, they did not expect that in an instant, the sound of killing shook the sky, blood flowed into rivers, and corpses lay all over the field. The Japanese invaders all knelt down and begged for forgiveness, abandoned their weapons and fled. In this battle, after three days and nights of fierce fighting, a total of 18 heavy artillery pieces were captured, countless guns and ammunition, a military flag personally awarded by the Japanese Emperor, and many tanks were destroyed. The enemy suffered 10,000 deaths, and our side suffered about 4,000 casualties. At this point, the Xifengkou area was completely recaptured by our army. However, there were a large number of wounded soldiers, as many as five or six days. The rear hospitals were extremely lacking, and there were no cars to transport them, resulting in many injured soldiers dying halfway due to the long distance and the fact they were carried. This is a painful thing for us, and a regrettable loss. Now I hear that the people in the rear are doing their best to help set up hospitals and provide all kinds of military supplies.</p>
<p>General Zhu reported on the work done over the past eight months: 1. The people of the Northeast, after being under the control of the violent Japanese, have not succumbed to the violent enemy. On one occasion, more than 2,000 villagers in Pingjinshan hated the Japanese to the bone. They were driven to the top of the mountain and shot to death with machine guns. Only one child was left, who was still seriously injured. This inhuman act is truly outrageous. 2. The enemy is very short of food and often forces the people to exchange food for an unlimited number of counterfeit national banknotes, and uses the counterfeit banknotes to pay the troops of the puppet state. Their intention is to rob our food and drive our ignorant people with worthless counterfeit banknotes. The viciousness of their means is imaginable. 3. Recently, our army seized a map of Manchuria from the enemy. On it, the borders of Inner Mongolia and Manchuria are all marked with very thick national border lines. Only the provinces of Hebei and other provinces bordering our Great Wall are not marked with lines or analyzed by boundary. It is then the intention of the Japanese side is not limited to occupying Rehe and the Great Wall area, but to further take our Hebei and Shandong provinces, or even attempt to change the color of our map to fulfill their dream of annexation. The people of the country can be awakened. 4. Whenever a wounded soldier is carried to the hospital, because they have been fighting in the sandy field for a long time, their clothes, pants, and socks are all soaked in hot blood and mud, drying and wetting again and again countless times. Therefore, once injured, the clothes they are wearing are firmly attached to their skin and flesh. If you want to treat their injuries, you must use iron scissors to cut open their clothes, so the pain they suffer is another layer of pain.</p>
<p>Finally, those present generously pledged to donate 13,360 yuan and 150 sets of woolen shirts and pants, which were handed over to General Zhu to transport north for temporary use. It is estimated that the Textile Industry Association contributed 5,000 yuan, Yu Zuoting, Zhu Meixuan, Jin Runxiang, Xue Chunsheng, Wu Yaqin, Hu Xiyuan, and Ren Jinping contributed 5,000 yuan, Wen Lanting contributed 1,000 yuan, which is temporarily designated to subsidize the wounded soldiers' hospital organized by the Guanghua Temple Charity Group in Beiping. The Cotton Cloth Industry Association contributed 1,000 yuan, Zhang Zilian contributed 500 yuan, and medicine worth 500-600 yuan. The Crepe Industry Association contributed 500 yuan, Shao Daren donated 150 sets of woolen shirts and pants, Guo Yonglan donated 300 yuan, and Wu Wenjing donated 200 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e109">The Northeastern Righteous People Beg for Help <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Yang Zhibin and Others Telegraphed the Story of Killing the Enemy</p>
<p>Hiding in the Wilderness, Asking for Assistance to Reorganize and Try Again</p>
<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Association in this city received a telegram yesterday from Yang Zhibin and other righteous people from the Northeast, saying, "Since the Japanese invaders occupied the Northeast, seventeen months have passed in a blink of an eye. In these seventeen months, the Japanese invaders have used their gradual encroachment and devouring plans every day to achieve their goals, occupying our land, massacring our people, and arousing the common hatred of all people and the common anger of heaven and man. Anyone with blood and energy cannot help but be furious. Zhibin, Yongzi, and others, motivated by the sense of duty of the common people, gathered righteous men and raised their arms to kill the enemy. The anti-Japanese experience is briefly described below, as a cry to the people of the country. Zhibin, Yongzi, and Zhao Zaiyin had more than 30,000 men. In May and June of last year, they attacked Fangzheng County, defeating the rebel army of Yu Shencheng, Li Wenbing, and Liu Yushu in Tongzigou, and defeating the Japanese army at Hongtuya, killing more than 200 Japanese soldiers, and sinking two Japanese warships in the Songhua River. In July and August, they captured Hecheng, and the rebel army of Chen Decai was defeated and scattered, killing more than 300 Japanese soldiers. In September and October, they attacked Shuangcheng and fought bloodily for three nights, finally recapturing it, and incorporating the 1,500 men of the rebel army of Zhang Yingjie, killing more than 50 Japanese soldiers. In November, they sent a team to blow up the Songhua River Bridge on the Ha-Chang Line, and more than 20 Japanese military vehicles fell into the water, and the Ha-Chang Road was blocked for more than ten days. This is a brief overview of the anti-Japanese efforts of Zhibin, Yongzi, and others. (omitted) The comrades are exposed to the wind and rain, sleep in the snow and eat frost, break through the forest of guns and brave the rain of bullets, and hide in the wilderness. For four days, they do not know the taste of salt. The various predicaments are too numerous to describe. Alas, to prevent Baishan from collapsing, we must throw our heads. To seek the long flow of the Blackwater, we must pour out iron blood. Han Guang and others have promised their bodies to the country and have no regard for anything else. As long as there is a breath left, we will definitely fight the Japanese invaders to the end. We only hope that the people of the country will give us assistance and generously contribute to the righteous cause. One bullet can kill one enemy, and one dou of millet can feed one soldier. We must enable patriotic men to continue their work, and the recovery of lost territories can be expected. Weeping and stating our case, we implore you to understand. Song Yongzi, Zhao Zaiyin, Wang Hanguang, Hou Laozhen, Wang Caichen, Liu Guodong, Yang Zhibin, and Rui Daoyi, Righteous People of the Northeast.</p>

<p>A General Meeting Will Be Held at the City Chamber of Commerce on the 9th</p>
<p>The First Special District City Federation, in view of the increasingly urgent foreign troubles, believed that it was imperative to promote national goods to save the crisis. Therefore, it was decided to hold a national goods movement meeting at the City Chamber of Commerce Hall in Tianhougong Bridge on the 9th of this month. Recently, it has been actively preparing and inviting various national goods manufacturers to participate. The letter to the representatives and manufacturers is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>To All Representatives,</p>
<p>Our association is organizing the National Goods Movement Committee to promote national goods, widely publicize them, and work hard to carry out the work. It has also been supported by all sectors. In order to expand publicity, we have scheduled to hold a National Goods Movement Meeting at the City Chamber of Commerce Hall at 1:00 PM on April 9th.

<p>This is to your esteemed representatives.</p>
<p>A Letter to Members Regarding the Announcement,</p>
<p>The Japanese army has invaded and occupied the Northeast, and has invaded Rehe, intending to covet Pingjin. The ambition of the Japanese bandits is to annex</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>China. Our people's salvation of the country, although there is no iron to resist the enemy, has only the urgent boycott of Japanese goods and the promotion of national goods to save the crisis. In view of this, our association is actively carrying out the national goods movement, implementing large-scale publicity to arouse the attention of the people and give them a profound understanding. We have specially scheduled to hold an entertainment meeting on the 9th of this month to publicize the purpose of national goods and saving the country. At that time, various national goods such as cosmetics, candies, and cigarettes will be distributed based on tickets. We hereby enclose a ticket of admission. Please check and receive it.</p>
<h3 id="e111">The International Trade Bureau Plans to Formulate State-Run Measures for Sino-Russian Trade <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Currently Under Study by Various Departments of the Ministry of Industry</p>
<p>Formal Consultations Will Be Held After the Russian Envoy Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Sino-Russian trade issue, since the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, the Ministry of Industry has been striving for state-run operation to avoid creating one-sided dumping. According to news from the International Trade Bureau, regarding the Sino-Russian trade issue, the two sides have exchanged views informally. Our side absolutely advocates state-run operation, while the Russian side opposes this move. Moreover, the Russian economy relies on exports for its maintenance, so it has made demands for trade between the two sides. The payment for goods exported to Russia cannot be made in cash, while the payment for goods exported to China must be made in cash, resulting in a large difference between the two sides. At the same time, the International Trade Bureau has reported from tea merchants that the export of Chinese tea to Russia has always required payment within fifteen months, causing tea merchants to be limited by their financial resources and unable to operate. And upon investigation, the major exports from our country to Russia are only tea and soybeans. After the loss of the three northeastern provinces, its position has been lost. Due to the above situation, tea in the Russian market has been completely taken over by Japanese tea and Ceylon tea. Therefore, according to this situation, we are only a market for others, forming one-sided dumping. Although Sino-Russian relations have now restored friendly relations, it is necessary to have state-run operation to maintain our country's industry and commerce, and to regulate equality. Therefore, the principle of state-run operation has been decided by the Central Political Conference, and the measures have also been submitted by the International Trade Bureau for adoption by the Ministry of Industry. The most important points include two: (1) The principle of exports is not to hinder our raw materials and people's food needs. (2) The principle of imports is not to hinder our inherent industries and small industries. And there are three ways: (1) Organize the Sino-Russian Trade Company to specialize in its affairs. (2) Organize a banking group by various banks to handle the exchange of funds for import and export goods. (3) The National Bank assists in this matter. These measures are currently under study by the various departments of the Ministry of Industry, and formal consultations will be held after the Russian envoy arrives in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Mr. Liang Shiyi previously came to Shanghai from Hong Kong, intending to go north to participate in the anti-Japanese war effort. After arriving in Shanghai, he felt unwell due to anxiety over the fall of Rehe. Subsequently, he discussed financial and industrial matters with friends in the economic sector from morning till night, becoming overly fatigued, and his illness did not heal. He moved into Baolong Hospital for treatment, but continued to concern himself with current affairs every day. Hearing about the recent situation in the North, his anxiety and indignation grew. Yesterday morning, he coughed up a lot of blood. A German doctor diagnosed a rupture of a cardiac aortic aneurysm, which is extremely dangerous. His family members have already rushed to his side separately.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Sixth Announcement of the Ningbo Association's Aviation Patriotic Fundraising Committee <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>

Thanks to the enthusiastic efforts of the team leaders, the total amount had reached over 80,000 yuan, but was still far from the original goal. Because it was around Qingming Festival, many people had returned to their hometowns to sweep graves, resulting in a significant number not yet submitting their donations. It was decided to extend the period by one month, with an announcement every ten days. Next, Chief Secretary Chen Qibo reported on the performance of each team in this session: Chen Shifan team 275 yuan, Shao Dabao team 200 yuan, Wu Yanqin team 149.32 yuan, Wu Hongming team 65 yuan, Zhu Jinjiao team 334 yuan, Lin Mianzhai team 36 yuan, Wu Jingsen team 100 yuan, Lin Boquan team 33.46 yuan, Tong Xianting team 100 yuan, He Shaoting team 500 yuan, He Shaoyu team 1000 yuan, Jin Shunliao team 230.03 yuan, He Juxing team 44 yuan, Zhou Daoxing team 120 yuan, He Gengxing team 89 yuan, Sheng Xuzu team 36 yuan, Zhou Yongsheng team 300 yuan, Mao Heyuan team 1335 yuan, Xue Runsheng team 200 yuan, Dong Xinqin team 10 yuan, Liu Pinsan team 30 yuan, Qian Guifu team 8.5 yuan, Wang Zuan team 16 yuan, Yu Xingben team 670 yuan, Shao Deming team 280 yuan, Zhang Youfu team 308 yuan, Hu Yonglai team 80 yuan, Chen Xingsun team 20 yuan, Sun Xianggui team 50 yuan, Tong Huitang team 200 yuan, Yu Dongxun 23.328 yuan, Dai Yulin team 200 yuan, Zhang Liyu team 201 yuan, Xin Fanseng team 80 yuan, Chuan Qilin team 120 yuan, Fang Chunsheng team 26 yuan, Shi Zhong'an team 100 yuan, Yu Zuoting team 1000 yuan, Yu Wenhao team 200 yuan, Li Lishui team 200 yuan, Chen Gengxin team 150 yuan, Qian Jinhua team 80 yuan, Shu Wanyao team 343 yuan, Chen Jingtang team 31 yuan, Jin Shantong team 200 yuan, Straw Mat Trade Association 70 yuan, Chen Jiugao team 5 yuan, Automatic Zero Contribution Account 50.778 yuan, Fan Huichun team 200 yuan, Shi Zhikun team 125 yuan, Ying Shenglin team 20 yuan, Ye Qifeng team 130 yuan, Xu Tingzuo team 125.9 yuan, Jin Runxiang team 1291.3 yuan, Chen Songyuan team 200 yuan, Hu Yongqi team 100 yuan, Ye Xianggao team 46.49 yuan, Shui Xiangyun team 50 yuan, Dai Yongtang team 541 yuan, Yan Boying team 106 yuan, totaling 12,744.106 yuan.

<p>League of Nations Review of the Report on the Investigation of Trafficking in Women and Children</p>
<p>My Representative Hu Shize Points Out Various Errors</p>
<p>Geneva, 5th (Havas) – The League of Nations Advisory Committee on the Protection of Children and Youth continued to review the report of the Far East Investigation Mission on Trafficking in Women and Children and listened to the explanation of Chinese Representative Hu Shize. Mr. Hu praised the investigation mission for overcoming various difficulties and finally completing its work, but said that the narrative part of the report gave the world the impression that Chinese women were most likely to fall into brothels, which was inevitably wrong. Regarding various proposals to prevent trafficking in women, Mr. Hu said that China agreed to establish a supervisory body under the central government, and that closer cooperation among local authorities in various places was especially necessary. This was because the situation in some parts of China was unique. For example, in Shanghai alone, the municipal government prohibited the opening of brothels, while the concession allowed them, which was one aspect of it. Regarding the fact that most of the staff in institutions protecting women and children were women, Mr. Hu stated that since the Chinese revolution, women could also seek employment, no different from men. As for the special issue of Russian women, Mr. Hu said that most of these women came from Manchuria, and the Chinese government could not bear responsibility for this part of the territory. Furthermore, Russian women who became prostitutes mostly did so within the concession. Finally, Mr. Hu repeatedly stated that the report acknowledged that the Chinese government was making great efforts to prohibit prostitution and hoped that education could prevent the scourge of brothels in the future, so that they would not spread.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Grand Occasion of the Annual Meeting of the Road Association <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Four Important Cases Resolved</p>
<p>Directors for the Current Term Elected</p>
<p>The China National Road Construction Association held its annual meeting yesterday at the Wen Zhi Hall of Jiaotong University, reporting on association affairs, preliminary budgets, and opening ballot boxes. International roads' latest films were also screened in the evening. The grand occasion is recorded in detail below.</p>
<p>Attendees: Attendees included President Wang Zhengting, Vice Presidents Kong Xiangxi, Xu Shiying, Xiao Zhenying (representative of Song Zheyuan), Sun Longji, Zhang Junjie, Municipal Government Representative Zhu Weiyao, Zhao Zukang of the National Economic Council, and League of Nations engineering consultants Ao Jingji and Puddley, American Commercial Officer Shi Fangnan, Dean Li Shuhe of Jiaotong University's College of Engineering, Representatives Li Yu and Tang Zhifu of the Jiangsu High Court No. 2 and 3, and representatives from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Public Works Bureau, Public Utilities Bureau, Education Bureau, Social Affairs Bureau, and various levels of members, directors, and staff, totaling over 200 people.</p>
<p>Meeting Proceedings: At 3:00 PM, President Wang Zhengting chaired the meeting and announced its opening. The entire assembly stood, and the President respectfully read the second article of the Prime Minister's Outline for National Construction. After everyone was seated, the President delivered an opening address, reported on the previous year's final accounts and this year's budget, and Chief Secretary Wu Shan reported on the association's progress and an outline of this year's work plan. All of these were printed and distributed on the spot.</p>
<p>Summary of Speeches: Vice President Kong Xiangxi spoke about his impressions from his recent travels to Europe and America to inspect road and municipal administration, such as how Germany was diligently researching substitutes for gasoline due to a lack of oil and minerals, and how transportation in the United States was convenient, but wages were too high, leading to some fruits being abandoned without anyone to purchase them. Our country is currently actively building roads and should pay attention to national defense and production to meet the needs of the country and the people. Ao Jingji, a member of the League of Nations China Engineering Inspection Team, spoke about the progress of construction in China in recent years, especially the development of highways. This proves the achievements of the Road Association's advocacy work, which is admirable. It is hoped that efforts will continue to be made so that the national highways can be completed as soon as possible, facilitating transportation and enhancing international glory.</p>
<p>Important Resolutions: There were four important resolutions: (1) Members Ao Jingji, Shi Fangnan, and Zhao Zukang proposed that the association should advise the government to establish a fixed annual highway fund for the entire country and each province and to plan organized road maintenance for the purpose of actively building highways and maintaining existing highways, and that these two matters should be considered as equally important highway policies as building new roads. (2) Cao Youying and Hu Siyi proposed that the association should open a road administration college in the near future to train specialized road administration talents for the application of road construction in various provinces and cities. (3) Ao Jingji, Shi Fangnan, and Zhao Zukang proposed that the association should recommend to the expert meeting of this year's Jiaotong University Engineering and Iron Exhibition that road construction be recognized not only as a feeder line for railways, but also as being equally important to railways in terms of promoting national sentiment, harmonious education and culture, and convenient national defense transportation, and that this be included in the conclusions to be widely publicized. (4) Shi Fangnan proposed that the National Economic Council's excellent work under the guidance of Zhao Zukang, Ao Jingji, and Puddley last year was commendable, and that its cooperation with the Road Association was not uncommon. The assembly should express its gratitude. All were unanimously approved and a letter of thanks will be sent separately.</p>
<p>Solemn Ballot Counting: The President appointed Ji Zhengkang and Cao Liheng as supervisors, and Zhao Zukang and Zhu Fanhua as ballot counters. Li Shuhe was asked to hand over the key to the ballot box, and Municipal Government Representative Zhu Weiyao publicly opened the ballot box to check the ballots. A total of 261 ballots were obtained and handed over to the ballot counters for detailed inspection, registration, and reporting.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Research on Factory Fires in the Public Concession in the Last Six Years <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Council has a report on the Zhengtai Rubber Factory explosion, so it is worthwhile to research the records of factory fires in Shanghai. According to the Fire Department's records, from 1927 to 1932, in the 3,404 fire and accident alarms, factories were the location of 391 incidents, accounting for 11.5 percent. The property losses were also greater for factories than for other items, accounting for 28 percent of the total amount. In 1927 alone, factory losses accounted for seven-tenths of the total fire losses, amounting to approximately 750,000 taels. Since factories are places where many people gather, the risk of fire endangering lives is also greater. Fortunately, this was not seen much in these six years, but if the numbers for this year are included, the proportion will greatly increase. From 1927 to 1932, a total of 125 people died in fires, including 23 in factories, and 356 people were injured, including 82 in factories. The Zhengtai factory incident was fortunate to be an exception, but soon after, a similar tragedy occurred outside the concession, showing that the types of industries in Shanghai are becoming increasingly diverse, and many of them require dangerous goods, so the risk of death and injury is also increasing. The Fire Department has recently divided industrial fires into seven categories according to international practice for comparison: 1. Textile industry, 2. Chemical industry, 3. Public utilities, 4. Food and tobacco industry, 5. Iron and other metal industries, 6. Printing and paper industry, 7. Miscellaneous. Rubber factories have developed particularly rapidly in the last five years and have been proposed for separate statistics. Cotton mills have the most fire incidents, with 125 in six years, followed by printing and paper industries, with 68. Food and tobacco industries and metal industries are roughly equal, with 31 and 32 respectively. In terms of losses, flour mills are the highest, followed by yarn mills, then food and tobacco industries, and then printing and paper industries. In terms of loss of life, one person died in the printing and paper industry, and six in yarn mills. Silk mills had the most injuries, with 30, followed by yarn mills with 11, food and tobacco industries with 21, and printing and paper industries with 16. According to the records for 1927, there was only one rubber factory. There were no fires in this industry in the three years from 1927 to 1929. In 1930, there were three, in 1931 there were four, and in 1932 there were five. There were no deaths, and only three injuries. However, the records for this year will be very different. Factories often have dust-filled air, and if it contains combustible fibers, it is extremely dangerous. This is a recognized fact in the industrial world in other countries. If more attention is paid to management in Shanghai's factories, the loss of life and property can be greatly reduced. Looking at the records of factory fires in the past six years, it can be seen that strict official supervision is extremely necessary. In 1927, a flour mill on Yichang Road caught fire. The factory had two buildings, old and new, and thousands of bags of grain were stacked between the two buildings, and another 30,000 bags were stacked on the side of the new building facing the courtyard, so that the fire brigade's turntable ladders could not be used. When the firefighters could not stand inside the building (nine of them almost encountered danger), they had no choice but to stand by and watch it burn. In March 1928, a two-story Chinese-style cigarette factory near Bianer Road was carelessly remodeled. The factory building did not have a building permit. When the fire started, the female workers rushed to the stairs. One side of the stairs was a wall, and the other side was a board wall. The door opened inward, so 19 female workers were trapped and could not get out. After the fire brigade arrived, they broke through the wall and rescued them. Two of them died from their injuries. At the beginning of the following year, a female worker in a silk factory had a match in her pocket suddenly explode. Two thousand workers panicked and rushed to the commonly used large staircase. In fact, there were four other staircases, but because they were not trained, they did not know how to use them. When the fire brigade arrived, they could hardly get in because of the crowds. When the incident occurred, some of the female workers, including relatives of the firefighters, immediately shouted to the crowd not to panic, so those workers were the only ones who were not injured. Thirty-one people were injured and sent to the hospital, three died from their injuries, and many others had minor injuries. In May of that year, a metal shop and oil depot on Xinji Bang Road caught fire, killing ten people, all because they could not escape. In July, a printing shop on Baker Road with an unlicensed top floor caught fire. In August, a cigarette factory on Zhoujiazui Road was careless, and a lane next to it was blocked by objects, making rescue very difficult. In 1931, a printing factory on Qipu Road caught fire, and eleven people were injured after jumping out of the building. In October of the same year, a fire in a refining factory injured three firefighters. In the same month, a fire in a yarn mill on Yichang Road spread to an unauthorized mat shed outside the building. Hundreds of female workers fled for their lives, and each floor had only one unlocked door. After being rescued by the fire brigade, six people were dead on arrival at the hospital, and five were seriously injured.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Two Gangs of Boatmen Fight Over Dock Space <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Changshu and Chongming Refuse to Yield</p>
<p>The two sides fought fiercely four times</p>
<p>The day before yesterday evening, in the Suzhou River, boatmen from Chongming and boatmen from Changshu clashed fiercely over dock space, engaging in four mutual brawls, resulting in injuries to many on both sides. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Chongming Gang Repels Changshu Gang: At 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, a Changshu cargo ship, captained by Xu Jinxiang, along with several crew members, sailed into the Suzhou River under the Jiangxi Road Bridge, intending to dock on the south bank to load tea. At that location, there were seven Chongming cargo ships connected together, preventing the Changshu ship from docking. Captain Xu Jinxiang became angry and strongly demanded that the Chongming ships yield the dock. The language was very intense and may have offended the Chongming ships. Shen Xigou and Yang Chuanfu, the captains of the Chongming ships, were angered by Xu's words and refused to move their ships. As a result, the two sides argued even more fiercely and refused to back down, leading to a sudden clash. Because the Chongming gang had more people, each holding bamboo poles and wooden sticks, they surrounded the Changshu gang. The Changshu gang could not resist the bamboo poles and sticks, and were all injured. Xu Jinxiang, Wang Louer, and Lu A'er were the most seriously injured, with broken heads and bleeding, and multiple serious injuries to their bodies. After persuasion from bystanders, they stopped fighting. The Changshu gang was filled with hatred and sought revenge. Considering it a great humiliation to be outnumbered and injured, they went ashore and gathered more people, returning to the ship at 5:00 PM to retaliate. As a result, the two sides clashed again, becoming more intense. Someone proposed peace, but the representatives of the two gangs refused to yield, and negotiations broke down. Before long, they fought again, and were persuaded by mediators to stop. However, after further arguments, it was still difficult to reach a peaceful resolution. The fourth clash then followed under the electric lights. At this time, there were many onlookers on both banks, and the enthusiasm for fighting on both sides grew stronger. The fighting lasted until nearly 7:00 PM, when water and land patrolmen arrived one after another after being reported. The crowds from both gangs scattered and fled, and Shen Xigou, the leader of the Chongming gang, intended to go ashore and escape, but was caught by the concession patrolmen. Western and Chinese patrolmen from the Customs Water Patrol also arrested Yang Chuanfu, Zhou Shuigang, Ning A'shi, Wang Feigang, Xu Xianggang, Gong Jinqi, and six others from the Chongming gang who had committed the assault, and sent the seriously injured Xu Jinxiang, Wang Louer, and Zhang A'er from the Changshu gang to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Both Gangs of Boatmen are Brought to Court: During the last battle, the clash was the fiercest, and many on both sides were injured. However, because there were no sharp weapons used during the fighting, there was not much bloodshed. When they caught sight of the patrolmen arriving, they fled in fear of punishment. After the Water Patrol detained the six arrested members of the Chongming gang, they continued to bring Xu et al. from the Changshu gang, who had finished bandaging in the hospital, back to the patrol station at 10:00 PM that night. At the same time, they sent personnel to the concession patrol station to transfer the leader of the Chongming gang, Shen Xigou, to be brought to justice for interrogation. They confessed to the circumstances of the clash, but the Chongming gang claimed that the Changshu gang had struck first and gathered hooligans to seek revenge, while the Changshu gang claimed that they were defeated because they were outnumbered, and that bystanders volunteered to go on board to help. The two sides' statements were contradictory. After taking their statements, the patrol station sent Detective Xue Silin at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon to send both sides to the local court to be prosecuted for disrupting waterborne security.</p>

<p>But death was not caused by abortion</p>
<p>Autopsy proves death was due to peritonitis</p>
<p>Gao Ruyizi, a female worker at the Dakang Yarn Mill on Pingliang Road, died of illness on the 3rd of this month at the home of her fellow villager, Sheng Chunlan. Someone reported this to the Yangshupu Patrol Station, saying that she had died from an abortion. The patrol station then ordered a detective to send the female corpse to the Filun Road Mortuary. After the First Special Court assigned Prosecutor Guo Wei to visit the mortuary to examine the body, he interrogated Kikuchi Tadao, a Japanese night watchman at the Dakang Mill, who stated that the deceased had an affair with Sheng and was pregnant. Sheng bought abortion drugs and made her swallow them, causing her to become ill and die. Prosecutor Guo then ordered the body to be...</p>
<h3 id="e120">Murder Case Involving One Yuan <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>You Deming Owes Money, Refuses to Pay</p>
<p>One Punch Kills the Creditor</p>
<p>He Yongfang, a native of Rugao, residing at No. 18, Xiaozha Bridge Street, outside Xiaonanmen in the Nanshi district, was 26 years old. He made a living pulling a rickshaw. You Congming, a fellow townsman, 27 years old, lived with He. Previously, due to lack of funds, he borrowed one silver dollar from He. More than a month had passed, and he had not repaid it. Although He repeatedly demanded the money, You always claimed he had no money. On the 2nd of this month, He again asked You for the money, but You still replied that he had no money to return. He became very angry and started cursing. You also refused to yield, leading to a quarrel. In a fit of rage, You punched He hard in the waist. People intervened to stop the fight, and the matter subsided. The next day, He suddenly felt a dull pain in his waist. He went to a doctor for treatment. The doctor examined him and said that he had suffered serious internal injuries and that treatment would take a long time. He was shocked to hear this, fearing something unexpected would happen. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, at around 2 PM, he grabbed You and reported him to Zhang Fengxiang, the guard at post number sixteen. Zhang brought him to the Third Section of the First District. After preliminary questioning by Chief Jin, the case was transferred to the Shanghai Local Court for investigation. The police from the section escorted the two to the court. The court detained You Deming and ordered He to return home first.</p>
<p>He was to seek medical treatment at the hospital and be summoned again when the court hearing took place. Unexpectedly, He's condition suddenly worsened when he returned home, and he died before he could be treated, at around 11 PM that night (the night before last). Yesterday morning at around 10 AM, Chief Jin learned of the incident and immediately dispatched Police Chief Wang Zuoxian to investigate. He also instructed Qin Defang, the local head of the Twenty-third Ward, to report to the court for an autopsy.</p>
<p>Details of the autopsy, etc., were previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday was the continuation of the inquiry.</p>
<p>According to the doctor's report, the autopsy revealed that the deceased had indeed miscarried a two- or three-month-old fetus. However, the cause of death was peritonitis. Mr. Guo informed the police of the above situation and inquired of Sheng whether he had had a relationship with the Gao woman. Sheng claimed that he had not. It was also possible that the deceased had engaged in physical relations with someone else. Mr. Guo concluded that the deceased, Gao Ruyi, died of illness before death, and the body was returned to Sheng Chunlan with a written guarantee for burial.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Closure of Bicycle Rental Shops in the French Concession <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Protest Against Repair Tax</p>
<p>Electing Representatives to Petition</p>
<p>There are more than 40 bicycle rental shops in the French Concession of this city. In January of this year, the French Municipal Council, noting that these shops also engaged in repairs, sent officials to inform them that they had to pay for a repair license according to regulations, at the rate of three taels of silver per quarter. The shops believed that repairs were not the same as establishing a factory or employing workers specifically for repairs, but rather a matter of occasional parts replacement. Their capital was very small, and their profits were meager. Since they already paid for business licenses, they could not afford to pay for repair licenses. Therefore, they unanimously refused to pay. It is now known that the French Municipal Council is determined to implement the tax. Seeing the opposition from the industry, they cut off electricity to more than ten shops, including Fei Dian and Xia Fei, that refused to pay the tax. At the same time, they announced to all shops that they must pay for licenses by a certain deadline. Upon hearing the news, all the shops were panicked. Starting yesterday, all 40-odd shops closed down. They also convened a meeting to discuss countermeasures. The following resolutions were made: (1) Establish a joint office; (2) Elect five representatives to petition the local citizens' association and other organizations; (3) Petition the Party and government authorities to find ways to stop the tax; (4) Notify the industry to await a resolution; (5) If the purpose of abolishing the tax cannot be achieved, they are willing to close down permanently and never reopen.</p>
<h3 id="e122">China Merchants Public Bus Company Adds Special Express Bus Service Between North Station and Zhenru <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>China Merchants Public Bus Company Limited (decided to start from the 8th of this month) will add a new special express bus service on the North Station-Zhenru route. Yesterday, a special announcement was made to all sectors of society: We, the company, are responsible for the transportation in the northern part of the city. We have been operating diligently for four years. Although we have been affected by the economic crisis and the January 28th Incident, we have tried our best to maintain the business and facilitate transportation in order to assist in the commercial prosperity of the city. After investigation, the passengers on the North Station-Zhenru route (i.e., Route 3) include students, gentlemen, merchants, ladies, rural people coming to the city for business, and small vendors, all with different interests in the speed and convenience of transportation. In view of this, our company has purchased several new and sturdy chassis and installed modern bodies to ensure the carriages are elegant and the seats are comfortable. It is scheduled to start running special express buses on the morning of the 8th of this month (i.e., Saturday). The buses will run from the Baoshan Road North Station, along Baoshan Road, Gongxing Road, Zhongxing Road, and Jiaotong Road, directly to the entrance of Jinan University. Except for the two terminals, where passengers will be picked up and dropped off on time, the buses will not stop along the way. They will run back and forth every five minutes to live up to the name of special express buses. The buses will run from 7 AM to 7 PM every day. The fare is set at 20 cents per passenger. We hope that people from all walks of life will travel frequently and provide guidance so that we can continue to improve.</p>

<p>Yuan Shixun, the director of the Hongzhen Fire Brigade, stated that although the area suffered from the January 28th Incident last spring, there were no significant casualties. Therefore, the number of residents and shops has been increasing day by day. The existing old fire truck is no longer sufficient. It is imperative to expand the fire fighting capabilities to maintain public safety. With the consent of the captain, deputy captain, and all members, and based on their ability to contribute, they raised a large sum of money in advance and contracted with Zhang Heji Machinery Factory in western Shanghai to build a new-style pumper truck. After six months, the work was completed the day before yesterday. It has been tested once and the results are excellent. It is said that notices have been sent to relevant groups. A large test will be held on the 9th of this month.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Expansion of Pudong Electric Company <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>| Extending to the Seventh District of Nanhui County |</p>
<p>The towns of Beicai and Zhangjiangzha in the Seventh District of Nanhui County each originally had a power plant to supply electricity to the residents. However, due to their small scale and poor business, further expansion was not a fundamental solution. Therefore, local scholars and businessmen Gong Huibo, Huang Bingquan, Min Luxi, and others initiated a fund-raising effort of 25,000 yuan to form the Huibei Electric Co., Ltd., which would no longer generate electricity on its own, but would instead contract with Pudong Electric Co. to purchase electricity for redistribution. Pudong Electric Co. has installed seven British standard No. 16 three-phase high-voltage lines, starting from Tangqiao Town, passing through Yanjiaqiao Town, and reaching the Shangnan border near Wangjiazai, with a total of more than 120 poles planted. From the Shangnan border, Huibei Electric Co. extended the same type of high-voltage lines, passing through Diguqiao to Beicai Town, and then from Beicai Town extending the high-voltage lines, passing through Qianjia Catholic Church, to Zhangjiangzha Town, with a total of more than 240 poles planted. A 20 kVA transformer was installed in Beicai Town, and a 30 kVA transformer was installed in Zhangjiangzha Town, to supply electricity to the residents. This line project was also contracted to Pudong Electric Co. The original low-voltage lines in the two towns, which were extremely disordered, were also thoroughly reorganized. The work was completed and electricity was supplied yesterday (the 5th). The voltage immediately stabilized, the lights suddenly brightened, and electricity was supplied day and night, which was especially welcomed by the users. Therefore, those who had stopped using electricity due to dim lights and other inconveniences have been requesting reconnection one after another, and new users are applying for installation in an endless stream.</p>

Yesterday, the association held an opening ceremony in Haiyan. More than 10,000 people attended, and the business of each factory was overwhelming. It is also reported that Chairman Lu of the association said that the enthusiasm of the local gentry and businessmen in Haiyan is unmatched by that of the gentry and businessmen in previous mobile exhibitions of national goods. In particular, Zhou Yangsong, chairman of the Haiyan Chamber of Commerce, strongly supported the exhibition and specially invited a Beijing opera troupe to perform at the site. Those who purchased goods worth more than three yuan were given a free opera ticket, so the customers were especially crowded. Mr. Lu returned to Shanghai yesterday to report on the event and to welcome factories to participate.</p>

<p>Across from the Huanlu Rainbow on Nanjing Road, the Shanghai National Goods Company was one of the earliest national goods companies established on Nanjing Road. Since its opening last year, its business has been exceptionally prosperous. This year, on Children's Day, to encourage children's patriotism and promote the foundation of national goods, it has added a children's playground in addition to the existing departments of silk, cotton textiles, knitwear, woolens, cosmetics, food, candy, Western clothing, apparel, new clothes, hardware, gifts, enamelware, glassware, electrical appliances, pharmaceuticals, and daily necessities. The playground specializes in selling children's toys and children's supplies. Although the playground has only been open for three days since the 4th, children have been crowding to shop. According to the statistics of the commemorative gift certificates given out, the number of children buyers has been nearly 4,000, averaging about 1,200 to 1,300 per day. The number of visitors is not included. The business of each department has also increased and flourished as a result. This shows the enthusiasm of the Chinese people for national goods. Now, in order to expand, the company has rented the premises at No. 393 Nanjing Road to plan for expansion. In addition to expanding the existing departments, it will add departments such as porcelain, pottery, lacquerware, carpets, straw mats, copper and iron beds, and appliances to meet the needs of the Chinese people's enthusiastic promotion of national goods.</p>

The goods are of high quality and the prices are low, which bodes well for the future development of domestic products.</p>

<p>Hua and Sang Wedding The wedding of Hua Qifeng, a Chinese employee of the French-American Insurance Company, and Ms. Sang Yizhuang, a famous woman from Suzhou, was held at the Central Grand Hotel yesterday (the 6th). The wedding officiant was Li Zanhou, Minister of Finance. The introducers were the famous lawyer Gu Gongbing and the great merchant Zheng Zijia. Mr. Hua has a wide circle of friends, so there was a lot of traffic in front of the hotel that day, and the guests filled the room. The scene was very grand.</p>
<p>Director of the Women's Temperance Society on Sick Leave Ms. Liu Wang Liming, director of the Chinese Women's Temperance Association, has been managing the affairs of the association for 13 years. Under her guidance, the association has established more than a dozen branches throughout the country, and has also created the Women's and Children's Training Institute in Jiangwan, which is the forerunner of the anti-begging movement. The Home Economics School seeks economic independence for poor women, and the women's public apartments in the French Concession seek welfare for women in the workplace. Also, in view of the lack of a proper media outlet for women in China, she gathered Wang Yiyun, Lu Yin, Shi Yifan, He Emei, and other women leaders from national universities last autumn to create the "Women's Voice" biweekly, which has been highly praised by society. Regarding her writings, in addition to "Happy Family" reprinted by the Commercial Press and "The Road to Self-Strengthening" reprinted by Liangyou Company, she has recently written "The Chinese Women's Movement," which is over 100,000 words long and is a masterpiece for women. However, since the beginning of spring, Ms. Liu has been overworked and suffering from heart weakness and insomnia. It is reported that Ms. Liu has followed the doctor's advice and requested a two-month leave of absence from the association's first board meeting this year to recuperate at home. All affairs of the association are entrusted to Vice Director Yang Meizhen to handle.</p>

<p>Popularity of Home Treatment Collection for Meningitis The Home Treatment Collection for Meningitis, written by Dr. Yan Cangshan, director of the Family Medicine Consulting Agency at No. 420 Rue Paul Beau in the French Concession, has been sought after since its publication last autumn. This spring, the weather has been abnormal, with warming followed by cold, and meningitis has been prevalent in various places, including Shanghai. According to the report of the agency, more than 1,000 copies of this book have been sold recently through retail and wholesale distribution. Opening of the Shanghai-Anhui Hospital Tomorrow Dr. Wang Guning of Anhui, who graduated from the University of Leuven in Belgium, specializing in medicine, received a doctorate degree. He then interned in the pathology laboratory of the Belgian Railways Health Bureau, and held various positions in internal and external medicine of venereal diseases and women's diseases at the Manchester University Hospital in the United Kingdom and the General University Hospital in Germany, staying in Europe for 12 years. He is now the director of the Shanghai-Anhui Hospital, mainly responsible for venereal diseases and women's internal and external medicine and nervous system diseases, and also treats other departments. The hospital is located at No. 5 Wenyuanli, across from the Far East Hotel on Tibet Road, telephone number 93405. The hospital was organized by enthusiastic people from Anhui, hence the name. It is scheduled to open tomorrow.</p>
<p>Reopening of Fulv Zhongyi Hospital The Shanghai Fulv Guild, in view of the fact that most of the fellow workers are from other places, and when they are sick, they are lonely and helpless in a foreign land, has been donating funds since the Republic of China 17 to create the Fulv Zhongyi Hospital for the benefit of the workers. A Western-style ward was specially built, and famous national doctors were hired to provide medical treatment and medicine to fellow workers and people outside the industry year-round, with a completely charitable nature. All expenses are covered by the annual donations from fellow workers, and the shortfall is subsidized by the guild. The hospital has more than 20 large and small wards, all of which are tall, clean, and well-ventilated. The doctors and nurses are very kind. It is not only the blessing of Fulv workers, but also the benefit of the public. According to Mr. Tao Hongfan, the director of the hospital, more than 4,200 patients were treated last year. The hospital was temporarily closed last winter due to insufficient funds. Recently, due to the changing climate and the increasing number of people seeking treatment, it was reopened as usual yesterday (Thursday). Anyone who is sick can go for treatment, and medical treatment and medicine will be provided as usual.</p>
<p>Savior of Women and Children Dr. Chen Jingfang, female doctor and director of the Sisters' Women and Children's Obstetrics Hospital at the intersection of Ningbo Road and Guizhou Road in the Public Concession, has been the director of the obstetrics department of major hospitals in this city for many years. She has treated countless women and babies, and has performed breech births. Her academic arguments are profound and her surgery is swift. It is recently heard that Mrs. Wang Rongsheng, the wife of the employee of the Second Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross Society on Xinzha Road, had a breech birth, Mrs. Gao Yuebo, the manager of the Yiyue Company at No. 458 Avenue Joffre, had a shoulder presentation, and a Zhou woman at No. 5 Yongxingli on Xiamen Road had a dead fetus in her abdomen and was bleeding excessively, making the delivery difficult and dangerous. All were saved by Dr. Chen, who injected the latest medicine and used forceps to remove the fetus. As a result, both the mother and the fetus were safe. They sent a plaque (Savior of Women and Children) to express their gratitude.</p>

<p>Reader's Advisory</p>
<h3 id="e139">Discussion on "Can One Return to the Countryside?" <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>丨Letter from Mr. Liu Simin of This City丨</p>
<p>Mr. Reporter, I read the Reader's Advisory on April 4th, and I was puzzled for Mr. Xiongsheng, and for the entire Chinese society. Today I saw the title of the Reader's Advisory, saying that it was a discussion of "Letter from Mr. You Huaigao of the Free Farm Answering Mr. Xiongsheng in This Column," and I was very happy. In my heart I thought that Mr. You would definitely give us many new opinions, but as soon as I started reading his letter, I was disappointed. Mr. You said: "People who have lived in the city for a long time may feel a little bored and lonely, but I think that in this time of national crisis, seeing the city living a life of drunken stupor, it is better to find a quiet and lovely countryside to seek another way out, relying on my own ability to spend ten years building a new kind of Arcadia in my imagination." What a "new kind of Arcadia," what an "Arcadia in my imagination." Since our Mr. You is dreaming of this so-called "new kind of Arcadia in his imagination," why doesn't he try it himself, spend "ten years" trying it, close the door, make his good dreams, and enjoy his peace? Even if the Japanese army attacks, or some bandits attack, they won't patronize him, because the people in Tao Yuanming's "Peach Blossom Spring" "did not know there was a Han, let alone Wei and Jin." Mr. You's "new kind of Arcadia in my imagination" must be "did not know there was Zhou and Qin, let alone the Republic of China, did not know the Republic of China, let alone Japan, England, and the United States." In my opinion, since Peach Blossom Spring is so happy, it is better to persuade Mr. You to try it out first. First, how will people enjoy such a sweet and peaceful paradise, and second, it will never be as difficult for Mr. You as it is for Mr. Xiongsheng. The "200 yuan" loan is not a problem for Mr. You, but Mr. Xiongsheng has no way to get it (perhaps Mr. You will have mercy and lend him 200 yuan, which is another question), because he is a "pauper." Mr. You, pluck up your courage and do it well. As for the Japanese imperialists, they have only occupied the four northeastern provinces for the time being, and they won't be able to attack our Jiangsu for a while (?). The bandits in Jiangxi won't be able to share the produce of our Jiangsu for a while either. Even if they attack Jiangsu or share the produce of Jiangsu, your "new kind of Arcadia" will definitely be able to "stand alone," because it "did not know there was Zhou and Qin, let alone the Republic of China, did not know the Republic of China, let alone Japan, England, and the United States." Readers, don't think I'm joking, no, no. To be honest, Mr. You's thinking is a true reflection of the current Chinese bourgeoisie's attitude towards current politics, because the Chinese bourgeoisie is at a point where it cannot advance or retreat. To simply seek peace is what they wish for, but they cannot, or at least they are embarrassed to. To truly resist, to mobilize the whole country to resist, they dare not. His social relations and destiny have determined him. So he is wandering on the fork in the road, and there must be this kind of escapist fantasy, fantasy, fantasy. As for Mr. You's so-called "preconditions" and all other methods, they are all branch issues that arise from this fantasy. If we were to discuss them one by one, I am afraid that we would have to add twice as much space. Enough, enough, what does the teacher think?</p>
<p>Furthermore, Mr. You is "a person who advocates saving the country through rural education," so he is tirelessly "planning and strategizing" for Mr. Xiongsheng. Unfortunately, he does not know that in the current capitalist society, the countryside is dominated by the city, and no one can escape this common rule. Naturally, in another progressive society, that is, a socialist society, this common rule must be broken and the opposition between the city and the countryside must be eliminated. However, this is definitely not the business of the current society. America's large-scale agriculture and Japan's relatively small-scale agriculture are both typical of capitalist societies, but their rural areas are bankrupt and their panic is getting worse. I would like to ask, is their rural education not ten or a hundred times better than ours? Why are they still on the verge of collapse? Because the problem is not here. Mr. You's rural education is at most following in the footsteps of the United States, but the result will definitely not help their 1.2 billion or 560 million debts. There is another level. Mr. You only knows one thing, but does not know the other. For example, he said: "The benefits of the countryside... the people are honest, there is no deceit in the city." But that's not true. The people in the city are not the whole people. The upper class, monks, and bureaucrats only have power and money in their hearts. Their tongues are like swords and their intestines are like ice. Mr. You's criticism is correct, but for example, in Shanghai, the majority of the 3.2 million people (shop assistants, workers, and some young students) are still honest and trustworthy. Mr. You's eyes are colored, so he naturally cannot see this class, and I think his head may not have turned to this aspect. We want to remind him, "Turn around."</p>
<p>Reporter's note: The reporter thinks that Mr. You will definitely have more insights to reply after reading Mr. Liu's letter. We are waiting. However, the reporter wants to make a statement here. We have a fundamental view on the discussion of the readers, that is, from the partial problems to the general problems, from the branch problems to the fundamental problems. Mr. Xiongsheng said in his previous letter that he wanted to go to the countryside, but his purpose was only to seek personal life. Therefore, the reporter answered him, "In this situation, if you want to return to the countryside solely for the purpose of making a living, then we really cannot see any optimistic future." This sentence should emphasize the words "solely for the purpose of making a living." The implication is obvious, and it is especially recited for the readers.</p>

<p>Detailed Information on the Northeast for Public Viewing</p>
<p>Cooperation Personnel Training Class Has Begun</p>
<p>Four National Cloth Sales Offices Have Been Established</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Minhang County People's Education Center recently made a three-dimensional map model of the Northeast, which is displayed in the central tea garden for public viewing, and has established a cooperative personnel training class and four national cloth sales offices. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Cooperation Personnel Training Class The first district cooperative established under the guidance of the center has been operating for two years and has been very effective in relieving the rural economy. Villagers from all villages have requested guidance and organization. Director Jin and Director Xi of the center, in addition to guiding the formal establishment of Huangfu Township, Li Dian Township, and Zigang Township in the first district in stages, also felt that there was a great shortage of cooperative personnel. Therefore, they specially drafted a simple charter, submitted it to the Education Bureau for approval, recruited elementary school graduates, and trained them for one month. Upon completion, they will be assigned to serve in cooperative societies in various villages. It is now heard that the class has started yesterday.</p>
<p>Northeast Three-Dimensional Map Model In view of the tense situation in the Northeast, the center, in addition to extracting important news from major newspapers and compiling them into wall newspapers, which are posted in various thoroughfares every day, recently designed a map and asked painter Gu Tifan to use clay, plaster, paint, and other materials to make a three-dimensional map model of the Northeast. On one side, it will write explanations of the customs, human feelings, products, and population of the three northeastern provinces and Rehe, so that the public can have a clear understanding of the situation in the Northeast after viewing it. It has now been made and displayed in the central tea garden, and the number of people going to visit it these days is very crowded.</p>
<p>National Cloth Sales Offices In order to relieve the rural economy, the center has specially stipulated the size, front, color, and style, and the first district cooperative will release white and colored yarn to rural women in various villages for spinning and weaving. The woven cloth will be sold by the marketing department on its behalf. It is now heard that in addition to the Aiqun Girls' School having purchased hundreds of bolts to be used for the school uniforms of the girls, it has also obtained the consent of Shanghai Wing On Company, the Mainland Department Store, the Zhabei National Goods Department Store, and the Penglai Market to sell it on their behalf.</p>

<p>More than 20 students from the Industrial College of Tianjin National Beiyang University, led by Dean Wang Jixu, took advantage of the school's spring break and arrived in Shanghai yesterday to visit the industrial and commercial situation in the city. They first went to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to ask for an introduction. The Chamber immediately sent letters to the Naval Aircraft Factory and factories in all sectors, asking them to provide proper reception. They are scheduled to start visiting one after another from today.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Results Were Only 47 Points Ahead</p>
<p>Highest Record of 169 Points</p>
<p>Liu Fuzong's Amazing Performance</p>
<p>丨Second Half Surpasses the Pellet King丨</p>
<p>丨Today, Li Gongying Meets Nie Kaor丨</p>
<p>Liu Fuzong is truly a master. Last champion Medinah was defeated in the preliminary round of the amateur Group A pellet shooting yesterday. At that time, there was still considerable room, and the loss of 47 points was not difficult to make up with one shot. We are abandoning talk of victory or defeat and talking about the facts. We feel that Liu's average stability is commendable. Medinah is of course an outstanding person, scoring 169 points in one shot, which is likely to be the highest record of this year's competition. Unfortunately, in the last few shots, his technique was flustered and he did not advance, almost ruining the big event. At the beginning of the competition, Liu's performance was good and he was often in the lead. He once led with 334 points to 256 points, but then he accidentally touched another pellet, which caused him to fall behind. Seeing Medinah score 169 and 33 points in a row, he finished the first half 500 points ahead, while Liu only had 361 points (a difference of 139 points). In the second half, Liu was able to confront the enemy and compete with each other at around 150 points. Until the end of the count, Liu's performance was particularly good, surpassing all the Shanghai pellet kings, including Medinah. The audience was amazed. If only the second half is considered, Liu actually won 92 to 00. Although the result was a loss of 953 to 1000 points, Liu can also be considered one of the masterpieces of his life. Today at 5:30 PM, our pellet king Li Gongying meets Nie Kaor. It is likely that Li will be able to cross the other side safely in calm conditions.</p>

<h3 id="e170">Seizing Property <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhihen</p>
<p>There was a market town far from the city where all matters, large and small, were handled by the local gentry, without disturbing the officials. Let's talk about a family in the town who, due to an incident, offended the local gentry. The gentry were seriously angered and convened a general meeting in the town hall. Everyone discussed and said, "We must show this family who's boss." As a result, they agreed to have this family hand over all their property for them to manage. The farmland near Nan Village was to be managed by the gentry living nearby, nicknamed "Thirteen Fists." The family, being in a state of decline, had no one to speak for them and had to obey.</p>
<p>Years later, this Squire Jia had a disagreement with the other gentry over another matter. Angrily, he said to the gentry, "From now on, don't ask me about local public affairs. I don't want to go to the town hall anymore." Someone next to him said to Squire Jia, "Since you're closing your doors and not asking about local public affairs, then you should return the Nan Village farmland of the family you were managing." Upon hearing this, Squire Jia showed the full arrogance of a local bully, tilting his small melon-skin hat on his head, rolling up his sleeves high, pointing a finger at the person's nose, and saying, "The Nan Village farmland? That's another matter. My family is living off of it now. Return it? Don't even dream about it!"</p>
<p>Haha! It was only managing someone else's property, but who knew he would treat it as his own and seize it, living off of it. Isn't this a great joke?</p>
<p>The Japanese are now withdrawing from the League of Nations, but they consider the mandate over the former German colonies in the South Seas to be Japan's lifeline and refuse to hand it over. I wonder if there's any difference between them and Squire Jia, who seized property?</p>
<h3 id="e171">Courage Training <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Bicheng</p>
<p>When the Taiping Army occupied the areas of Suzhou, Songjiang, and Taicang, the Jiangsu gentry raised a large sum of money and hired foreign merchants' giant ships to transport Li Hongzhang's Huai Army to Shanghai. The special envoy for requesting troops was Qian Dingming of Taicang, the son of former Hunan Governor Qian Baozhen. Baozhen had friendship with Zeng Guofan, so Dingming was publicly recommended to enter Zeng's camp to request troops. Li Hongzhang was sent to Shanghai, and Dingming accompanied him. Soon after, when the fighting with the Taiping Army began, Hongzhang invited Dingming to observe. As they got closer, the bullets fired by the Taiping Army whizzed overhead. Hongzhang sat motionless, talking and laughing as if nothing were happening. Dingming suddenly lost his composure. Hongzhang smiled and said to him, "Bullets have eyes and don't injure people indiscriminately. Just relax and sit comfortably." Dingming's courtesy name was Diao Fu. Hongzhang had been through many battles and was naturally used to it; his courage training had reached a stage of pure skill. His saying that bullets have eyes and don't injure people indiscriminately was a rhetorical trick, probably a common saying he used to tell his subordinates. Later, Dingming repeatedly followed Hongzhang to supervise battles, gradually gaining courage. He accumulated military merit as a Juren (a successful candidate in the imperial examination) and also became a provincial governor.</p>
<p>A man from Suzhou, Zhu Yonghuang, entered the Yangtze River Navy Camp as a martial arts Jinshi (a successful candidate in the highest imperial examination) and practiced target shooting every day, never missing a shot. After returning to Suzhou, he followed a certain commander to Taihu Lake to suppress bandits. In a battle on the lake, none of the shots he fired hit their target, either flying too high over the bandit ships or too low, landing in the water before reaching the ships. The commander said to him, "You still lack experience and courage. When your heart races, your arms shake, and you can't aim accurately." Later, after repeated battles, he gradually became bolder, and his long-standing skill of never missing a shot when practicing target shooting was finally able to be displayed.</p>
<p>Judging from the above two incidents, courage training is indeed the most important task for a general. Since it's called training, it's naturally not something that can be accomplished quickly in one or two attempts. One must fight many battles and go through several fierce battles before having confidence. One must never harbor self-abandonment due to initial timidity and neglect to practice, ultimately leading to fleeing at the sight of the enemy, delaying national affairs, and ruining one's own reputation and career. This is something that those in military service must carefully consider.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Resume <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Lu</p>
<p>The more underpaid and poorly clothed the position is, the more difficult it is to get. Besides the written and oral tests, the most important thing is the so-called resume.</p>
<p>Because of the resume, Zhu was successful, and so it is even more difficult for a class of impoverished young men with genuine learning to get a small-paying teaching job in primary school, or a clerkship in an organization, than to ascend to Heaven. In this era of talent identification and selection, the impracticality of education and the lack of propriety in politics are still being loudly proclaimed from time to time in newspapers and in the mouths of the people. It makes this unqualified, impoverished person watching seem as preposterous as watching a Raymond Chandler mystery and wondering what the punchline is.</p>
<p>However, the resume of the great American inventor Thomas Edison was that of a primary school dropout and a newsboy... The resume of the great modern writer Maxim Gorky was that of a lawyer's clerk, a reporter for a newspaper, and a ticket seller for the telegraph... In general, they were complete vagabonds. Their resumes generally did not have the T.M. MR titles. However, how did their careers and literary fame startle the whole world instead? It makes this unqualified person even more perplexed.</p>
<p>Utterly bored, I pulled out a book of ancient prose to look at. "Bai Longxi was a commoner from cloth who drifted to the land of Chu and Han. At fifteen, he loved swordsmanship and visited the various lords. At thirty, he composed essays and strongly criticized the ministers..." Strangely, Li Bai, who took off his boots in the golden palace and composed Qing Ping Yue for the Tang Emperor, was actually such a sword-loving madman from Chu. "Generals and ministers are not born noble, a man should strengthen himself." "Heroes are not judged by their low origins." Even in the era of autocracy, there were such arguments. How is it that in this modern era of overthrowing feudalism, resumes are emphasized instead?</p>
<p>However, there are many remnants of XXX among the great men of modern times. I don't know how their resumes are written:</p>

<p>— Ke Ding'an</p>
<p>Having left the solemn and frigid weather, we have now entered the mild and gorgeous season. According to most people, "This is the birth of the god of spring."</p>
<p>In the silent garden, due to the birth of the god of spring, the withered grass turned tender green; the withered trees became lush; the faded flowers became more vibrant, and the birds that had stopped singing resumed their songs... To the point that everything greeted the god of spring with great enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The god of spring was immensely pleased. It thought, "All the creatures on earth expect me and yearn for me in this way. I should give them the ultimate comfort." So it scattered the seeds of happiness among humanity.</p>
<p>乂　　乂　　乂　　乂</p>
<p>"Saving the country through aviation" is truly the only patriotic method this spring. The number of people who generously donated must be considerable. It is said: "Spending two yuan allows one to obtain a badge." Because spending two yuan allows one to obtain a badge, more and more people are donating.</p>
<p>The so-called modern people take this novel and unique badge to decorate themselves. For men, it is seen on the brim of the felt hat, on the left lapel of the long gown, on the left lapel of the suit... For women, it is seen on the short coat, on the long cheongsam..., one can see the small, novel, and unique badge of "Saving the country through aviation."</p>
<p>乂　　乂　　乂　　乂</p>
<p>Modern women welcome the arrival of the god of spring the most. They have now shed their bulky fur coats and put on light jackets. What is popular these days is a long cheongsam made of soft double crepe, covered with a short coat of matching color, or a light-colored short-sleeved long cheongsam paired with a woolen vest with an open front, or a short-sleeved pleated long cheongsam worn with a vest that is tightly fitted at the waist and about a foot long..., It is always necessary to match the climate and weather of spring in order to express the typified image of women.</p>

<p>Chapter 3: Ultimately Failing to Untie the Knot and Visiting the Door to Make a Mistake, Secretly Pitying the Wish of the Young Maid to Share Food and Give Kindness</p>
<p>With love, sensible families and insensible families can be brought together. Don't you like to read the news, don't you like to read social news? There are often young men and women who betray their families and run away together. This is because the man and woman are willing, but the families are insensible. This is what that is all about. Zhao Weng laughed, "Don't let the conversation stray further and further. You should go back to the camp and not delay public affairs." Zhao Ziqiang smiled, "My brothers have heard that you have moved here and want to get together for a meal." Zhao Weng said, "It's okay for everyone to come here to chat. Buy four liang of bai gan (white liquor) and a jin of peanuts, and everyone can have a fragrant and crispy meal. Don't waste money buying things to send over, I won't accept it. Soldiers only have a few hard-earned coins, why waste them?" Zhao Ziqiang said, "I know your temper. I've stopped them more than once, so they didn't come." As he spoke, he casually put the hat hanging on the wall on his head. Zhao Weng said, "A soldier should always be neatly dressed to have spirit. How can you wear your hat askew?" As he spoke, he walked forward, held the hat with both hands, and straightened it for him. He smiled and said, "You're a head taller than me now." As he spoke, he patted him on the shoulder and said, "Child! It wasn't easy for me to raise you to adulthood." As he spoke, he bent over and compared his height to his knee, saying, "I was only this tall when your mother died. I raised you to be this big. If your mother were alive, she would be so happy to see you today." Zhao Ziqiang said, "My mother has been dead for over twenty years, you still can't get over it. Don't think about it, I'm leaving. Invite Old Lady Yang over for a chat." Zhao Weng said, "No, she has to rush to work." As he spoke, Zhao Ziqiang walked outside, and Zhao Weng followed him out. Zhao Ziqiang said, "Don't come out, look, the yard is full of snow, don't slip and fall." Zhao Weng stood at the doorway and said, "When will you be back?" Zhao Ziqiang said, "I'm afraid it will be three days before I can come back." As he spoke, he stepped on the snow and walked towards the outer courtyard. When he reached the gate of the courtyard, he turned around again and said, "Tomorrow, have Xiaolin buy a chicken to stew for you to eat, okay? Chickens are very cheap in the countryside. Don't save money." (34)</p>

<p>— Ren Yu</p>
<p>Formal training begins tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>"Roll call"!</p>
<p>"All present"! Because this is the first day, there are definitely no absences, not even tardiness. Then:</p>
<p>"Attention"!</p>
<p>"Right face"!</p>
<p>"Forward"!</p>
<p>"Take large steps"!</p>
<p>··················</p>
<p>Dawn, to the next dawn, to the third day... It passed quickly like a movie. The weather gradually warmed up. The feelings between the soldiers and Mr. Sun gradually became harmonious. However, uh-oh! The sounds of talking and disobeying orders during drills gradually stirred up. And because the soldiers had never been on the front lines and faced bullets, their numbers gradually dwindled.</p>
<p>This kind of situation became more common:</p>
<p>"Cannonballs flying ahead! Kneel"!</p>
<p>Originally, the soldiers should kneel on the ground quickly and mechanically. But,</p>
<p>"Sir! I can't! The ground is too wet"!</p>
<p>"I can't! It's too dirty here! Like a dog pooped here"! "No! I can't kneel! My pants will tear"!</p>
<p>Also:</p>
<p>The squad leader nicknamed "Pretty Boy" also came to drill wearing a hybrid military-civilian outfit: On top, he wore a Western-style red sweater with a high collar turned up, and on the bottom, he wore a cloth military pants and leather boots.</p>
<p>"No way! Look at you! What is this mess! Change"!</p>
<p>"No"! Pretty Boy mourned with his pretty face.</p>
<p>"Why not"?</p>
<p>"I washed it last night, and it's not dry yet. I don't have a military uniform, and I'm not allowed to wear other clothes, should I come to drill naked"?</p>
<p>Yi! Huzzah! Huzzah! A burst of cheers thundered. Mr. Sun also laughed.</p>
<p>(IV)</p>
<p>Because there were so few soldiers, so few that it was a bit pitiful, they couldn't be a threat.</p>
<p>Mr. Sun! His mind was also flexible enough. He said: "The infantry manual is finished. Now it's time to teach the structure of guns and cannons." Back to the lecture hall.</p>
<p>Still trouble.</p>
<p>Mr. Sun did his best to draw a gun on the blackboard. "This is the barrel... this is the bolt... the safety device"...</p>
<p>But, sketching orchids, reading novels, talking, ... also created a smoky atmosphere.</p>
<p>(V)</p>
<p>"Hey! Why hasn't Mr. Sun been in the lecture hall for the past few days"?</p>
<p>"Maybe that old man from Hubei went to open a wonton shop"!</p>
<p>Indeed, Mr. Sun hasn't been here for several days. Go back to his hometown? No, he doesn't have a home in Hubei. Sick? Not likely either. And he didn't ask for leave from the school either. Hey! Really strange!</p>
<p>A month later.</p>
<p>"Military training officer Sun XX of XX school... used the name of Minister XX XX XX and requested a position from the XX Bureau of this city... It is confirmed to be forgery and is being charged with the combined crimes of deception and forgery and sentenced to imprisonment..."</p>
<p>Oh! So that's the kind of Mr. Sun! Finished! Finished!</p>
<p>"The Yellow Crane is gone, never to return! Only the great drill field remains here"! The soldiers simply sang it as their military song.</p>
<p>It was almost winter vacation.</p>
<p>Strange! Another disappearance: our big shot, our chairman, our student army preparatory member is also gone.</p>
<p>A few days later. The owner of the military clothing shop, Mr. Wang, brought a bill - a bill for over a thousand yuan, to our school. But no one came to accept it.</p>

<h3 id="e176">Special Badge <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Dasheng</p>
<p>Last year, I had a friend returning from studying in Germany, accompanied by another friend's German wife. It was the first time for this German lady to come to China, and of course, she couldn't understand the great mystery that China is. After arriving in Shanghai, they went to Nanjing together. When entering the city, the German lady saw that everyone entering the city had to have their luggage searched by the guards at the gate. Only my friend, I don't know what magic weapon he held up to the guards, immediately passed through safely, without the trouble of being searched. She was very surprised and asked:</p>
<p>"What is the reason for this?"</p>
<p>"Because I showed a special badge from a military organization to the guards, so I can be exempt from inspection," my friend explained. "So, with a military organization's badge, one can be exempt from any inspection?"</p>
<p>"That's how it is in China."</p>
<p>"Wonderful! Wonderful!" In the end, the German lady murmured to herself, expressing great surprise!</p>
<p>In fact, what's so surprising about this? In China, generals, lords, and even police officers, everywhere, have the "power" to take advantage. It goes without saying where "profit" lies, even in small matters like taking buses, boats, or going to the theater, they invariably take advantage. The reason is simple: Didn't the ancient sages and worthies say? "Those who govern are fed by the people." The meaning of being fed by the people is that a group of people is naturally entitled to take advantage, while another group is naturally meant to be taken advantage of. There's no need for "Wonderful!" in this.</p>
<p>An ancient saying also says: "The prince who violates the law is punished the same as commoners." Of course, this is just deceptive talk. Originally, it's hard to say what "law" is. Even if the prince truly commits a "crime," holding a "prince's" badge naturally entitles him to some advantage. For example, recently, it is said that Liao XX and four others were arrested simultaneously in Shanghai on suspicion of something. If we say that they are "guilty," then naturally all five are guilty. However, because Liao XX is the son of a martyr, someone gave him a badge that allows him to take advantage, so he was quickly released on bail, while the other four were eventually "sent to the capital for legal investigation."</p>
<p>Of course, we are not saying that allowing Liao XX to be released on bail is something that shouldn't have been done. We just feel that allowing bail because Liao XX is the son of a martyr is really strange. But Liao XX has already secured the advantage because he is the son of a martyr. As for the other four, when we think of the fact that many young people have disappeared without a trace after being sent to the capital in recent years, we can't help but worry about their future!</p>
<p>The revolution is said to have succeeded, and "people's rights" have also been listed as a classic for saving the world. However, "people's rights" are ultimately not as powerful as "military power" or "official power," and still rely on the protection of special badges. Thus, young people arrested simultaneously and in the same place are naturally destined to be released on bail or sent to the capital, legally investigated, or disappear without a trace. As for whether or not one needs to be inspected when entering Nanjing, that is ultimately a very small difference.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Empty Running <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Weiyin</p>
<p>What exactly am I running for? Let me tell you.</p>
<p>Every time I go out, it seems I'm going to keep an appointment that I absolutely must keep, or to do something I absolutely must do. Before leaving, although I didn't think about where to go, once I'm out, there will always be a place that appears in my consciousness. So I go to that place I became aware of, as if there is someone I love to see waiting there, or something I prefer doing is taking place. When I arrive, as I should have imagined, I realize that there's nothing there. What's there is still ordinary people talking trivial nonsense. So I wait, waiting for the person I love to see and the thing I prefer doing, in the midst of that group of ordinary people talking trivial nonsense.</p>
<p>Among that group of people, I listen to them talk, and find it quite interesting. I listen intently, sometimes as if I am a member of that talking group or several groups, or every group. Sometimes, I don't hear anything they say, as if I am in a completely silent place. I am just me, solely me. I watch them come, watch them go; sometimes I suddenly see that a group at a table has changed, not knowing when the former group left and when the latter group arrived. But the person I love to see or the thing I prefer doing still hasn't arrived.</p>
<p>So I know I was wrong. If I hadn't come here but had gone to another place, I would have encountered the object of my desire. So I get up and go to another public place. But my desire still cannot be fulfilled, which doesn't seem surprising to myself. But what is my desire? Or, what is the person I love to see, what is the thing I prefer doing? This, I can't really answer. In fact, I'm not very clear. Or is it just running from one public place to another public place? I'm not very clear.</p>
<p>Yes, this is the ultimate purpose of my running.</p>

<p>— Zhou Lengjia</p>
<p>Avenue Joffre in spring is as dry as a desert. Every car that drives past kicks up a cloud of dust.</p>
<p>The sidewalks on both sides are full of foreign gentlemen and ladies with high noses, fashionable men walking arm in arm, and Pekingese dogs that eat twenty cents worth of raw beef every day.</p>
<p>The sun hangs obliquely on top of a seven-story building, and a French flag flutters in the air on top of it.</p>
<p>Several coolies pull a coal-laden cart, passing by on the road. Coal stains their faces, and sweat pours down their heads, like black devils. "Hang yu! Hang yu!" It makes one think of the Volga Boatmen's Song. At the intersection of Songshan Road, a row of five Vietnamese police officers stand guard, blue uniforms, pointed hats, rifles, creating an atmosphere of solemnity. People walking by feel a shiver in their hearts. In front of the Paris Grand Theater, two white cloth advertisements hang on the polished marble pillars on either side of the entrance. The advertisements are written with large characters about a foot in diameter: "Flower Butterfly." More people go in than there are flower butterflies.</p>
<p>The XX Electric Company, the five-tube radio in the window is broadcasting, broadcasting Wang Wuneng's "Crying for Old Uncle Du." A large circle of people surrounds it, listening.</p>
<p>Russian restaurants are competing for business, five cents for a soup, two dishes, and coffee.</p>
<p>"Dong! Dong! Dong!" "Tap! Tap!" A squad of Vietnamese soldiers turns from Luban Road and enters the barracks. At the intersection of Avenue Ferguson, a fire truck rushes past in front of a streetcar, high ladder, red body, the firefighters' brass helmets glinting in the sunlight. "Ming du du du!" Whizzing by, the ground vibrates.</p>
<p>Avenue Joffre, this is Avenue Joffre, filled with the contradictions of the current stage of capitalism.</p>

<p>— By A. Maurois, translated by Wei Ke</p>
<p>(In recent years, the cry of "Master" within the country is deafening. Many people do not know the origin of such fellows. Having recently read a novel by Maurois, I saw this piece and hurriedly translated it to share with readers.)</p>
<p>When the novelist Grace walked into the studio, the painter Hunchback Stone was about to finish a still life painting: a few flowers inserted in a glass jar, a few mushrooms placed on a plate. Grace stared at her working friend for a while and said decisively:</p>
<p>| No.</p>
<p>The one who was working, surprised, raised his head and put down the work of embellishing a mushroom.</p>
<p>| No, Grace repeated, in a stronger tone, no, you will never succeed. You paint skillfully, you are quite talented, you are very honest. But your paintings are very ordinary, my child. Such paintings will not move people, will not arouse people's talk. In a salon displaying five thousand paintings, yours will never attract the attention of the sleeping audience... No, Hunchback Stone, you will never succeed. That's credible.</p>

<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>"Bring me one of the steamed buns in that basket to eat."</p>
<p>"·····················"</p>
<p>Haiquan was relieved when he heard that. He hurried to the vegetable basket and took a big bean paste bun and gave it to Shiguang. Shiguang's mouth was covered by the big bun, and the room became quiet.</p>
<p>"Old Lin, bring me another one."</p>
<p>This really startled him, how could Shiguang eat so quickly. He went over again and picked one for Shiguang.</p>
<p>"·········Aren't you eating?"</p>
<p>Shiguang asked Haiquan while biting.</p>
<p>"I ate noodles this morning. Sister-in-law, aren't you eating?"</p>
<p>Haiquan asked Qiuying.</p>
<p>"I've eaten. ············"</p>
<p>"You've eaten? You ate on the road?"</p>
<p>"No. A friend invited me to a teahouse. ..."</p>
<p>This time she smiled at Haiquan very meaningfully again. Haiquan then thought, this woman is really more special than ordinary women, the child is sick at home, the husband is hungry at home, and she is still in the mood to go to the teahouse with friends outside to drink tea.</p>
<p>Thirty-two</p>
<p>Haiquan really slept on a military bed in Cao Shiguang's couple's room for three nights. The first night, he only heard the rustling sounds on their bed. He was so nervous that he didn't dare to cough, just endured his saliva and listened. At first, Qiuying advocated not turning off the lights. But Cao Shiguang advocated turning off the lights. Of course, Haiquan also agreed, because he knew that if the lights were on, all three of them might not be able to sleep. Haiquan's military bed was far from their bed, so of course he couldn't see anything. But Haiquan was always nervous, his spirit excited, and he couldn't sleep. By the third night, he thought that if he slept here for two more nights, he would definitely have neurasthenia, especially this night. He seemed to hear Qiuying's very slight chuckle. After he heard it, he couldn't sleep even more, but he had to pretend to snore loudly. He thought, if the pavilion room wasn't empty tomorrow, he would have to open a hotel outside. Even if it cost more money, he wouldn't hesitate.</p>
<p>When he got up the next morning, it was past nine o'clock. He only saw Qiuying changing the child's diaper. He didn't know where Shiguang had run off to.</p>
<p>| Why? Honest Hunchback Stone sighed. I do what I see, I don't expect anything else.</p>
<p>| But there is one more thing you have to pay attention to: you have a woman, my child, a woman and three children. Now milk is eighteen sous a liter, and eggs are one franc each. And there are more paintings than people who buy paintings, and there are more ignorant fools than people who know the goods. So, Hunchback Stone, what method do you have to stand out?</p>
<p>| Work?</p>
<p>| Don't joke. The only way to make these fools pay attention, Hunchback Stone, is to do something extraordinary. Spread the word that you are going to the North Pole to paint. Dress like an Egyptian king and wander outside. Found a sect. Mix some terminology together: such as the expression of force, and draw up some declarations. Deny movement or stillness, white or black, circumference or rectangle. Invent new Homeric-style paintings that can only distinguish between red and yellow, cylindrical paintings, octahedral paintings, quaternion paintings...</p>
<p>At this time, a strange and gentle fragrance announced the arrival of Mrs. Koslezusga. This was a beautiful Polish woman whom Hunchback Stone admired. She subscribed to some high-priced magazines, which spent a lot of money reprinting the masterpieces of three-year-old children; because she couldn't find the name of the honest painter Hunchback Stone in them, she looked down on his paintings. She leaned on the sofa, looking at the canvas that had already been started, shaking her golden hair, smiling with some regret:</p>
<p>| I saw yesterday, she said in a reed-like melodious tone, a modern black art exhibition. Ah! This kind of artistic sensibility, imagination and power! The painter turned a portrait of himself that he was satisfied with to show her.</p>
<p>| Not bad. She said casually, and then disappeared with her reed-like melodious tone, full of fragrance. Hunchback Stone threw the palette aside and fell on the sofa: "I'm going to change careers to be an insurance company auditor, a bank clerk, a police officer, etc. Painting is the lowest profession. Success is made by those fools. Only those conspirators can get it. Critics don't respect painters, but encourage those barbarians. I've really had enough of this, I won't do it anymore.</p>
<p>Grace listened to his words while smoking a cigarette, and considered for a while:</p>
<p>| Would you like to give these worldly people and pseudo-artists a deserved lesson? he finally said. Do you feel you have the ability to solemnly and mysteriously declare to Koslezusga and other aesthetes that you have been engaged in the innovation of your painting method for ten years?</p>
<p>| Me? Honest Hunchback Stone said in surprise.</p>
<p>| Listen to me... I will use two very eye-catching papers to tell everyone that you founded the Conceptual Analysis school. Before you, portrait painters only knew how to study people's faces. Unconscious things! This is not right. What truly represents a person is the concept he evokes in our hearts. For example, a portrait of a colonel is five huge sleeve badges horizontally arranged on a blue and gold background, with a horse painted in one corner and some medals painted in another corner. A portrait of a businessman is a factory chimney and a clenched fist placed on the table. Hunchback Stone, do you understand what you are going to give people? And can you paint twenty Conceptual Analysis portraits for me in a month?</p>
<p>The painter smiled quietly. (To be continued)</p>

<p>The Volatility of Gold Prices is Extremely High</p>
<p>New Price of 1,101 Yuan Appeared, Finally Rising 2.6 Yuan</p>
<p>Morning Opening Rose Due to Imposition of Export Silver Tax</p>
<p>Turned Down Due to U.S. Restrictions on Gold Hoarding</p>
<p>After-Market Continued to Rise Slightly Due to Germany's Plan to Abandon the Gold Standard</p>
<p>The gold market fluctuated greatly yesterday, initially rising and then falling. At the beginning of the morning, the overseas electricity reported that the silver slightly rose by 0.0625, the New York silver price increased by 125, the British-American and American-British exchange rates increased by 0.625 and 0.5625, the forward silver price increased by 0.5 cents and 1.5 mils, and the last two months fell by 1 mil and 1 cent. The American cotton rose by 5 pounds. Although not much, coupled with the Central Political Conference's resolution to abolish taels and change to yuan, and a 2.25% tax on all export currency materials, people's confidence improved. The gross price opened with a jump to 923 yuan. Hengyu, Fuchang, Richang, Chunyuan, Yongyi, Fengyong, and Junyong all bought in, rising to 978 yuan. At this time, a private telegram reported a increase of 125, slightly declining. By the time the market opened at 1,097.2 yuan, the exchange market opened slightly tighter, but because the U.S. government issued an order that each household could only hoard 100 yuan in gold, and any excess would be punished, which was no different from a gold ban, as people had cash of only 100 yuan per household, and the rest was paper money, a rise and fall began. The Guangdong gang still sold bars, the exchange market was slightly firmer, breaking the 90 yuan mark and falling to 1,088.3 yuan. Afterwards, the exchange market improved, and the July U.S. dollar rose from 29.5 yuan to 31.25 yuan, rising to a new high price of 1,101 yuan. Huabi offered 25 for the July U.S. dollar, and the noon closing was 1,098.7 yuan. The afternoon opening was 9.5 yuan, and the downward trend was still strong. Overseas electricity reported that the U.S. Treasury Secretary was collecting materials for a silver price meeting, Mumbai rose by two annas, and unfavorable news such as Germany's impending abandonment of the gold standard came, and the price fell to 90 yuan. Although it rose by more than 4 yuan due to the lack of a definite method in Germany, it broke 90 yuan to 89.5 yuan due to the sale of bars by the Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu. The closing price was 1,090.2 yuan, with a red addition of 25.6 yuan at the beginning and a final addition of 21 yuan. The swap spread retreated from 12 yuan to 9 yuan, and the source of spot goods was endless. The market conditions of the day are recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 1,097.2 yuan, a rise of 9.6 yuan compared to the previous close, which was beneficial to the gold market due to the central news. The goods opened at 6.5 yuan, and the exchange market opened with British flat and American slightly tight. The near-term offer was British exchange at 1 shilling 8 pence 25, and the U.S. dollar at 28.8125 yuan, which was not satisfactory, so it gradually fell back from 7.6 yuan. In addition, the overseas environment was not good, and Fuyu, Zhifeng, and Yong all sold. The U.S. dollar for this month could be settled at 8125, and Dadeshun and Hengyu competed to sell, falling to 4 yuan, while Fuyu bought in. The July U.S. dollar was difficult to settle at 4375, and there was a slight rebound. Before long, Huabi came out with the July U.S. dollar 375, Pan Gen also stuffed the June U.S. dollar 1875, and Shengda went to the market to sell bars, with a strong momentum. Although Fuyu bought in, it still fell to 3 yuan, hedge buying, and it was about 4 yuan. The HSBC listing was announced at this time, and the British and American currencies were not changed. Pan Gen stuffed the July U.S. dollar 4375, and Shengda still came to sell bars, retreating to 2 yuan. Huabi stuffed the U.S. dollar 875 this month, Qian Changxiang sold bars, and Hengyu also came out, falling to 90 yuan. At this time, people's minds were extremely chaotic, and the news was not good, so the selling wind was extremely strong. The July U.S. dollar 0.5 yuan was also difficult to sell, and Zhaofengchang and Hengyu even sold to 89 yuan. Shunli entered bars, once pulling up more than 1 yuan, but still retreated to 88.3 yuan. Fuchang and Shunli both entered, and the shape rebounded. After that, the bank stuffed the July U.S. dollar 0.5 yuan quite frequently, and the price hovered around 90 yuan. When Hua Huo ate the June U.S. dollar 25, Qian Changxiang and Shunli competed to enter, rising to 91 yuan. Zhaofengchang, Wanxing, Yifeng, and Yong also paid, reaching 2.8 yuan, while the goods came out, retreating to 2 yuan. Zhongfu ate the July U.S. dollar 4375, and Fuyu and Yuankangxiang entered to 3.3 yuan. Although Hengxing sold to 2 yuan, people's confidence had improved, and the exchange market also showed signs of improvement. Daxingyong bought fiercely, and Hengyu also bought, reaching 5 yuan, which was Mitsui grabbing the July U.S. dollar 375. After that, the buying intention in the market was still strong, and Yuanxin Yong bought fiercely, and Xiexingyong also paid. The July price of 375 was difficult to settle, and the gold price jumped, soaring upwards. Daxingyong entered again, reaching 100 yuan. Tongtaichang sold bars, retreating to 9 yuan. HSBC grabbed the July U.S. dollar 3125, Fuchang entered fiercely, rising again to 100 yuan. Zhifeng Yong entered again, reaching 01 yuan. Huabi came out with the July U.S. dollar 25, Shunli sold bars, Hengxing also came out, and the noon closing was 1,098.7 yuan. After the closing, Shengda still came out, retreating to about 8 yuan, and the goods had already been auctioned at 9 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon opening was 1,099.5 yuan, and the goods opened at 8.8 yuan. Hengxing limited the market and wanted to sell but couldn't, and Fuchang took the opportunity to sell a small number, retreating to 8 yuan, because the May U.S. dollar 875 and the June U.S. dollar 25 could be settled. Xiexing Yong entered, hovering around 8 yuan. Fuyu sold bars, to 7.3 yuan, and the goods and Richang competed to buy, soaring to 9 yuan. Zhengjin came out with the July U.S. dollar 3125, Chunyuan Yongfuyu came out again, falling to 7 yuan, Yuan Maoyong also sold, to 5.5 yuan. Zhifengyong went to the market to pay bars, reaching 6.6 yuan, and Jincheng also stuffed the July U.S. dollar 3125, Yuan Maoyong sold again, falling to 5 yuan. The May U.S. dollar 9375 bank was willing to come out, Yuanshengyong and Hengyu sold desperately, retreating to 3 yuan, Zhifengyong still paid, and Dadesheng also bought, reaching 4.5 yuan. After that, the exchange market lacked transactions, and the market rose and fell entirely due to people's intentions. Overseas electricity reported that Germany would abolish the gold standard, and Mumbai also rose. For a time, the selling atmosphere suddenly became strong, and Yifengyong, Zhaofengchang, and Zhifengyong competed to sell, a 4 yuan cascade, falling to 90 yuan. Hengyu bought in continuously, and retail investors also raised, gradually rising to 4 yuan. Suddenly Hengyu came to sell, lacked opponents, and still went downstream. Fuchang also sold, falling to 90 yuan, but because Yuankangxiang bought in, it rose to 3 yuan, because at this time the market price lacked standards, and retail investors could do the tricks of lifting and pressing. The gold price then rose and fell suddenly. Afterwards, the saying that Germany would abandon the gold standard was spread again. Ruixing sold many times, and the bank did the May U.S. dollar 875 for the month, breaking the 90 yuan mark and retreating to 89.5 yuan. The closing price was 1,090.2 yuan. After the closing, the downstream continued to take shape, and the goods were dumped, so the goods were auctioned at 88.8 yuan. The highest price for the whole day was 1,101 yuan, and the lowest was 88.3 yuan, with a fluctuation of 12.7 yuan. As a result, the price rose slightly by 2.6 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The listed price was due to the HSBC Bank listing of British and American currencies unchanged, the U.S. exchange rate was 28.5 yuan, and the alloy price was a strong 1,177.7 yuan. According to the closing price, the press was about 87 yuan, which was a little less than 3 yuan weaker than the previous close (the shilling listing price was 814.3 yuan). The account for this month was 1,113 yuan, May was 1,099 yuan, the morning supplement was 1,110 yuan, and the afternoon account for this month was 1,104 yuan, May was 1,090 yuan, and the supplement was 1,101 yuan.</p>
<p>The market transaction was mediocre. In summary, Shengyong, Shunli, Yuanshengyong, Ruixing, Fuchang, Tongtaichang, Zhaofengchang, Hengyu, Dadesheng, etc. all sold, and Daxingyong, Qian Changxiang, Yuanxinyong, Xiexingyong, Richang, Yuankangxin, Zhifengyong, and Tianfengyong, etc. entered. The Dalian gang sold first and then entered, and finally came out. The Guangdong gang, Shengda, sold 300-400 bars. Hengxing came out in the foremarket and entered in the aftermarket. The total number of bars in May was 18,221.</p>
<p>The red addition at the beginning was estimated to be 25.6 yuan. Tongfengheng entered more than 100 taels, which was sold by the silver shop Laofengxiang, estimated at 26 yuan. Later, the off-market price gradually decreased. The Tianjin gang continued to come out and offer, estimated to sell 800 taels to Yingfengheng, at a price estimated at 24 yuan. The aftermarket was even lower, and the Hakka gang continued to sell, with the off-market price estimated at 21 yuan.</p>
<p>The swap spread continued to decrease. Qian Changxiang (Taikangrun) and Yingfengheng, etc. scrambled to swap together, and Tongfengheng also had a tendency to let go. Because the source of the Hakka gang was constantly flowing, the spot number had a full stomach, and had to do a cheap swap, so the market was immediately given 12 yuan by Qian Changxiang (Taikangrun), 105 bars were given out by Hengyu, 70 bars were given to Yingfengheng by Daxingyong, 11.5 yuan, and 35 bars were given to Yingfengheng by Dakang, for 11 yuan. Hengxing also decreased to 10 yuan, 5 cents and was given to Yingfengheng (Yingfengheng ate the goods arriving from the Hakka gang), and 70 bars were transacted. Hengxing also gave 28 bars to Qian Changxiang, also for 10 yuan, 5 cents. Hengxing allocated 175 April bars to Yingfengheng, with a price of 1,102 yuan. The aftermarket was even cheaper. Yuan Maoyong gave out 210 bars, and Xiangfeng gave 70 bars, all entered by Yingfengheng for 9 yuan, and Yuan Maoyong gave 70 bars to Dafengheng, at the same price. There are still 4,298 April bars left. 119 April public orders were released by Qian Changxiang, and 42 orders were released by Yingfengheng, with 112 orders received by Tongfengheng, 21 orders by Runchangyong, 14 orders by Runchangyu, and 7 orders each by Hengxing and Hengyu, for a total of 161 orders.</p>
<p>After this, it is likely that the export of silver has a tax relationship, and the export will be reduced. Large bars will therefore increase in gold price, but foreign exchange is affected by the reversal of trade. Silver goods should be exported to offset the excess of imports over exports in trade. It is feared that because the export of silver is taxed, it will become tighter. There were many flattened transactions in yesterday's market, which is to worry about the changes in gold prices in the future.</p>

<p>American Exchange Speculation and 期標</p>
<p>Hedging Will Become Increasingly Distant</p>
<p>Yesterday's Foreign Exchange Quotes Still Calculated in Silver Taels</p>
<p>According to yesterday's foreign dispatches, London's long and short term rates both rose by 0.0625. British exchange rose against the US exchange by 0.0625, and US exchange rose against the British by 0.05625. The near-term British exchange opened at one shilling and eight and a quarter pence (equivalent to $16.576 in national currency). True receipts were at par. New York silver prices rose by 0.125, and short-term silver prices also increased. Private silver also rose by 0.125. American cotton increased significantly, but because the gold market was rising, the American market was slightly tight, calculated at $8.8125 (equivalent to $4.85 in national currency). It remained firm after opening, because the United States had measures to restrict gold. July U.S. gold continued to reach $29.5, difficult to sell. Pan Gen and others were dumping small amounts of Luzon currency. At this time, after the exchange rate was announced at HSBC, neither the shilling nor the American exchange changed. Thereafter, transactions were difficult, with few buyers. Appetite improved, and it gradually became tight. July U.S. exchange had moved from $29.5 to $31.25, with banks still accepting. The banks stopped buying at noon, and there were very few transactions in the afternoon. Abolishing the tael and adopting the yuan is our country's determined policy, but Western merchants have not agreed. Therefore, the opposite side is lacking. The foreign exchange news was not good. A telegram from Bombay reported a rise of two annas. Finally, banks did deals for this month's U.S. exchange at $8.875. At the close, recent bids were slightly tighter than the previous close by 0.0625. British exchange was at one shilling and eight and one-eighth pence ($16.627). American exchange was at $8.75 ($4.84). Banks tightened, and slightly absorbed before noon. Gold merchants were speculating on the American exchange and 套出期標. The trend seemed firm. Hedging has moved further away today. However, due to the obstruction of silver exports, the hedging trend still needs to be resolved. Therefore, gold merchants have to speculate on the American exchange and 出期標 in order to close out hedges. The bank's daily transactions are recorded below.</p>

At noon, the asking price ranged from $8.625 to $9.25. There were very few transactions in the afternoon due to the silver dollar dispute. Only Jin Cheng and Pan Gen plugged July's currency at 3125. Finally, HSBC sold to Huayi April's currency at 875. At the close, the selling price for April was $8.875 (one U.S. dollar equaled 48.4 cents in national currency), May was $9.0625 ($4.81), June was $25 ($4.78), and July was $4375 ($4.75).

<p>丨Morning and Afternoon Interbank Interest Rate Both at Five Percent丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, banks and money houses, upon receiving orders from the Ministry of Finance, implemented the abolition of the tael and the use of the yuan. People in the industry were extremely busy sorting out previous procedures that day and had no time to attend to business. As a result, news about receipts and disbursements could not be calculated at all. Also, the exchange of silver dollars in the market was impossible. Only a few interbank draft transactions took place yesterday, with interbank interest only at five percent for both morning and afternoon sessions. Silver public orders were also cancelled. Small money houses made subsidiary currency. Jiangnan small silver dollars were at 860 yuan for both morning and afternoon sessions, with 6,000 jiao transacted in the morning session and 5,000 jiao in the afternoon session. Guangdong small silver dollars were at 804 yuan and 5 jiao in the morning session and 804 yuan and 2 jiao in the afternoon session, with 95,000 jiao transacted in the morning session and 40,000 jiao in the afternoon session.

<p>Various Groups Unanimously Dumping, Prices Dropping by Several Jiao to One Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, after a four-day market closure for government bonds, changes in the current situation and its brewing became increasingly clear. In terms of war, the situation fluctuated between tense and relaxed, with no significant progress. Furthermore, Qinhuangdao was reported to be tense, and the spread of communist bandits in Hebei Province was becoming increasingly rampant. Market rumors were even more prevalent. In the first session yesterday morning, various groups leaned towards selling, and the decline was severe. However, most of the sellers were scattered retail investors, and major players seemed to be adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Market prices plummeted by more than one yuan, and sentiment suddenly turned weak. In the second session, except for Serial Number 1, which was slightly in demand and rose by two jiao, the rest continued to fall by three to five jiao due to more sellers than buyers. The Northern groups also sold slightly. When the market opened in the afternoon, the situation gradually eased, and market prices showed mixed gains and losses, amounting to about two or three jiao. At the close, due to Serial Number 1 and 47 being slightly in demand, market prices uniformly rebounded by one or two jiao to three or four jiao. As a result, compared to before the holiday, it still fell by several jiao to more than one yuan, and the trend appeared slightly chaotic. The total transaction volume was 9,044,500 yuan, including 14,500 yuan in spot and 9,030,000 yuan in futures, of which salt tax bonds accounted for more than 3.6 million, troop reduction bonds were over 1.2 million, and the remainder ranged from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands.</p>

<p>A report from Xin Feng Foreign Firm stated that on Wednesday (the 5th), the New York stock market was generally firm, mainly because the Chicago grain prices continued to rise. However, railroad stocks were slightly weaker than yesterday due to the sharp decline of the Chicago Northwestern Railroad. The total transaction volume for the day was 1.14 million shares. According to the Steel Age magazine, the steel capacity utilization rate this week was estimated to be 16.5%, an increase of 1.5% over the previous week, due to the increase in automobile production and the orders for a large number of iron barrels by the brewing industry. The Dow Jones indices are listed below:</p>

<p>Deliberations on Changing Yarn Transactions to Yuan Basis, Auctions Still Suspended Yesterday</p>
<p>Due to reports that the Ministry of Finance had issued a telegram ordering the implementation of the abolition of the tael and the adoption of the yuan starting yesterday, the Silver and Money Industries had a meeting and decided that the Exchange should also properly deliberate on measures. Due to numerous procedures, the market was temporarily closed for one day yesterday. Therefore, the morning and afternoon sessions were not open for auctions. However, spot yarn trading on the market was still smooth. Activity was gradually seen in the South China area. However, the Sichuan groups had very strong intentions, exclusively purchasing 4,500 bales of 20-count Red Kui Xing yarn for April, May, and June delivery. According to some, the rumors of yarn mills reducing production were very strong, and they were deeply afraid that prices would be expensive in the future, so they were taking precautionary measures, all of which were speculative in nature. The majority of the market expected that the auction yarn tomorrow would rise by more than one yuan. What the future holds still requires considering actual needs and adjusting accordingly. It was found that over the past two days, guest groups purchased a total of 1,795 bales of spot and the Sichuan groups purchased 4,500 bales of futures. Market prices rose by 2.5 to 5 cents. The purchase amounts of each group are as follows:</p>
<p>Jiangxi 100 Anqing 15 Xiamen 80 Mainland 85</p>
<p>Sichuan 305 Weihaiwei 15 Guangdong 585 Hankou 50</p>
<p>Ningbo 5 Shantou 235 Fellow Traders 320</p>
<p>Spot cotton sales were mediocre, and market sentiment was relatively stable. Because yarn sales were active, market sentiment was good. However, the Indian cotton market was sluggish, and the sources were estimated at 1,000 bales of Yao cotton.</p>
<p>Cao Nan Cotton 51.00 Tong Yi purchased 500 bales for delivery to the factory</p>
<p>Lao He Kou Cotton 31.50 Tong Yi purchased 170 bales for delivery to the factory</p>

<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton was initially weak due to foreign merchants selling, then firm due to reactionary buying, and finally soft again due to some 期頭 closing out. Futures rose by 3 to 6 points, and spot rose by 5 points. British cotton futures rose by 2-3 points, and spot rose by 2 points. Egyptian cotton spot rose by 4 points. Indian cotton was weak due to numerous deliveries and 期頭 closing out of April and May contracts. Pingguoer and Aomula rose by 1.5 rupees, and Bairoxi rose by 1 rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated the 5th):</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than 40 sources, and urban and rural stores showed strong demand. Therefore, the market conditions suddenly became fresh, not restrained by the slightly larger sources. Guest houses opened for business, and the market conditions for thin rice stabilized. In summary, the prices of Su Tong Group and Nangang Green Tip and other rice were high by several jiao. Du Yangjian and Yin Yuan rice showed more improvement, and prices rose by several jiao. Bian Yuan had no ups and downs.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 22-23 boats arrived from various groups along the river. White japonica rice was active in the early morning market, causing prices to be shouted higher. The market turned stagnant in the afternoon, and the market form was highly determined. Medium and lower grades increased by nearly a chi. Thin early rice arrived and sold well, and prices were stable. Sheep Tip rice was slightly tight by a fraction. Du Tip rice was stable. Wharf Guest Tip was flat and correct. Yin Yuan arrived in small quantities and sold actively, and prices showed a tightening trend. White Yuan rice was high and firm, and medium and lower grades had a stable trend.</p>

<p>丨During the Transition Period, Prices of All Goods Temporarily Remain Stable丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, spot sales of miscellaneous grains were converted to Yuan pricing. During the transition period with prices in taels and yuan, the prices of all goods temporarily remained stable. A total of 12 cars of Niuzhuang beans were sold, with prices ranging from $5.42 to $5.40. This street's Yuanfang (source) group sold 3-4 cars, and the rest were taken by factories. Two cars of beans were sold, with Zhengyangguan beans at $5.32 and Yizhou beans at $5.28, purchased by export groups. Du beans and Shayang went quickly and sold well, and the market was showing signs of recovery. Because bean cakes were using Yuan pricing for the first time, factories sold hundreds of pieces each to meet the market's demand. The Jiangbei group purchased more than 300 packages of red sorghum, with prices at $3.50 for Gao Hongke and $3.28 for Chong Hongke. The market was tight with high prices and a shortage of goods. Medium and lower grades were only mediocre.</p>

<p>Foreign Wheat Prices Reported Good, Guest Groups Purchasing, Prices Rising in All Months</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Grain Exchange was closed, and the Noodle Exchange was only open for half a day in the afternoon because it was following the government's order to uniformly switch to the Yuan system on April 6. Because the procedures were not completed in time, the market was closed for half a day. The Noodle Exchange opened as usual in the afternoon. Because foreign wheat futures and spot prices were reported to be high, market sentiment was upward. Factories, large and small, were covering positions, while customers were purchasing from Shandong groups. After the market opened, prices rose uniformly in all months. In the middle, prices once fell again because Tianjin guest groups sold. At the close, there were again customer demands, and prices turned for the better again. In the end, April increased by 1.25 cents, May increased by 2.75 cents, August increased by 2 cents, and the rest of the months increased by 2.5 cents each, all calculated in Yuan. The outlook is that because overseas reports are high and factories and customers are covering positions, market sentiment is generally upward.</p>

<p>Xiamen tangerine cakes have been scarce recently, but name-brand goods still have some inventory. In terms of inventory, the market is extremely stable. However, sales have been rare recently, and they are being squeezed by local Wenzhou factory cakes. The trend is flat. Yesterday, it was heard that name-brand shops opened dozens of barrels. The goods were still good and were three cents less than the previous market price. If land prices follow and loosen in the future, then Shen reporting can be cost-effective.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw the auction gold price increase again, with a tightening trend. The Sugar Industry Association's division of the market for abolishing the tael and adopting the yuan was implemented yesterday. Therefore, the Sugar Industry Association decided on several measures for changing to the yuan system as follows: "(1) All sugar markets will implement the abolition of the tael and the adoption of the yuan starting today. (2) The unit of yuan for incoming and outgoing goods will be in cents. Five li or more will be rounded up to one cent, and less than five li will not be counted. (3) The labor fee on this street will be changed to $0.14 per dan, with a 10% discount. The guest group labor fee will be changed to $0.17 per dan, with a 3% discount. (4) The customs inspection fee will be changed to $0.04 per dan, with a 50% discount. (5) The price of unbagged refined sugar sold according to the tael standard should be converted to yuan at an exchange rate of 715. (6) The money for goods sold before today will be converted to yuan at an exchange rate of 715 on April 5th. (7) Invoices issued by merchants will be calculated in yuan from today onwards." As a result, sugar prices have also been changed to yuan pricing. Ordinary grade 24 coarse granulated white sugar was priced at $21.15. Later, it was divided at $21.12, slightly higher than before. No. 20 medium granulated white sugar was priced at $20.04. Guanghua Factory opened by Changxing was selling 50 bags of powdered sugar at $21.68. Lu Zi cotton white sugar was at $21.4, and Shou Zi sugar was at $20.098. Chao groups opened authentic Shang Bing white sugar at $21.82, about 3 jiao higher than before. This factory's car ice No. 1 was opened at $24.7, and No. 2 was at $24.7. Zhenxin opened Binghuaqing at $16. (Yesterday's report listed the Hechi futures price as $3.775, and the character "三" was misprinted as "一". It should be corrected.)</p>

<p>Yesterday, the silk market in this port's foreign firms was still lonely and lackluster. Although New York silk futures had some rise in points, the current factory sales were not rising.

<p>Justice Minister Stages a Last Stand and Resigns, Then is Persuaded to Stay</p>
<p>The Saito Cabinet Can Temporarily Prolong its Existence</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 7th Fast Telegram: Justice Minister Oyama visited Prime Minister Saito at the Prime Minister's official residence at 9:30 AM this morning, before the scheduled cabinet meeting, and formally submitted his resignation. He left at 9:40 AM and entered the Imperial Palace at 9:50 AM to report to Chief Aide-de-Camp Suzuki, asking him to forward the message. This move by the Justice Minister was expected to be met with efforts to persuade him to stay, so he staged this last stand to make it impossible for them to do so. After Justice Minister Oyama resigned, it was generally expected that the Saito Cabinet would take a sharp turn for the worse and would have no choice but to resign en masse. However, Prime Minister Saito immediately reported to Finance Minister Takahashi and Home Minister Yamamoto, and at the scheduled cabinet meeting at 10:00 AM, he made great efforts to persuade the Justice Minister to stay. Before the cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Saito, Home Minister Yamamoto, and Finance Minister Takahashi, the three giants, discussed the matter and decided that the Prime Minister should strongly urge him to withdraw his resignation, saying that if the Justice Minister resigned at this time, it would directly lead to the resignation of the entire cabinet, which is not appropriate given the current political situation and national conditions. He asked him to resign together at an appropriate time. At the same time, the cabinet used its authority to ask him to reconsider his resignation. Justice Minister Oyama also understood and withdrew his resignation, deciding to stay in office. Thus, the crisis of the cabinet's mass resignation was averted for the time being.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 7th Fast Telegram: When Chief Aide-de-Camp Suzuki reported Justice Minister Oyama's resignation to the Emperor, the Emperor believed that resignation should not be considered at this time of emergency and issued an imperial decree to persuade him to stay. Justice Minister Oyama was grateful for the Emperor's grace and hastily withdrew his resignation, deciding to remain in office.</p>

<p>Reuters, New York, 6th: The millions of Americans who are eager to indulge in their drinking habits may be slightly disappointed that the 18th Amendment to the Constitution will not be repealed tonight.

<p>German Nationalism Flourishes</p>
<p>Poses a Great Threat to its Western Neighbor</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 6th: French Prime Minister Daladier delivered a long-awaited diplomatic speech in the Chamber of Deputies today, expressing France's anxiety about the situation in Germany and asking the question, "In view of a resurgent nationalism, should Europe redraw the map to seek peace?" Daladier continued, stating that France intends to pursue a constructive policy and opposes the supervision of great powers, as it is even more ambitious than the Holy Alliance. Any convention must logically be based on the Kellogg-Briand Pact, the Locarno Treaty, and the entire League of Nations Covenant, and not on a part of the Covenant, so that this revision does not lead to jealousy among nations. France will submit practical amendments to the British disarmament plan, but France sincerely hopes that Britain's loyal efforts will be fully successful. In his speech, Daladier praised Britain and Italy, and in the economic sphere, he said that he would gladly acknowledge the goodwill expressed by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini towards France. After the speech, the Chamber of Deputies passed a vote of confidence in the government by a vote of 430 to 107.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 6th: French Foreign Minister Peng Gu spoke in the Chamber of Deputies before the vote of confidence, stating that Germany's combination of political and police agencies is a clear violation of the peace treaty. France is now consulting with the signatories of the Locarno Treaty to question Germany, and if necessary, will raise the matter in Geneva. He continued, stating that the Disarmament Conference is now encountering opposition from the Italian-German bloc, and if the bloc continues to do so, it will trigger tomorrow's war in Europe. Peng Gu also praised Britain's loyalty and concluded that Italy's proposals should be considered so that the four major powers can cooperate on relevant issues.</p>

<h3 id="e232">Japanese Division Commander Conference, Army Minister Araki Barks Madly <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>Using the Guise of an Extraordinary Period to Encourage Militarism Among the People</p>
<p>Supplementing Military Personnel and Preventing Communist Infiltration</p>
<p>China United News Agency, Tokyo: The highly anticipated Japanese National Division Commander Conference opened at 9:00 AM on the 30th of last month in the First Conference Room of the Ministry of the Army. In an atmosphere of extreme tension, Army Minister Araki gave a lengthy speech, the content of which is worthy of attention. The outline is as follows:</p>
<p>Understanding of the Current Situation: The importance of the current domestic and international situation was explained in great detail at the team leader conference convened last spring and at the end of last year. There is no need to repeat it here. Since Japan officially recognized "Manchukuo" on September 15th of last year and resolutely withdrew from the League of Nations recently, the Japanese Empire has been in a state of external isolation and internal chaos. However, our soldiers have been able to overcome difficulties and deal with the crisis in this extraordinary period, which is a cause for celebration for the future of the Empire. I hope that everyone will be even more determined to fulfill the mission of defending the country, prepare for total national mobilization, and properly handle even greater crises in the future.</p>
<p>Leadership and Guidance of the Army: Since we soldiers have shouldered such a major mission, in order to give full play to the essence of the army, we must strengthen the consolidation of leadership within the army and the strict guidance of organizational activities and the spirit of control. The central leadership is paying special attention to this point. After several studies, it is believed that it is necessary to give special respect and support to the position and authority of the team leaders at all levels, who are the driving force of the organization, and especially to strictly lead and supervise the newly appointed young officers, and to guide them with love, so that the entire army can reflect on itself, unite under strict military discipline, and strive to revitalize itself.</p>
<p>Implementation of the Military Reform Plan: The Military Improvement Plan to save the situation, which has been planned for a long time, has been passed by the 64th National Diet. This is one of the main countermeasures of the army. As long as the budget is approved, it will be implemented immediately. The Military Reform Plan is designed to adapt to the urgency of the situation. The content of the improvement of various systems is based on the emergency projects of 1933 and 1934. However, it is believed that it can be implemented as a permanent improvement when necessary.</p>
<p>Supplement of Personnel: Regarding the disposition of combat personnel, a full account was given at last year's Division Commander Conference. In order to consolidate the strength of leadership, it is necessary to promote excellent technical personnel and to strengthen the combat team leaders. The central leadership is paying special attention to this point. I hope that everyone can conscientiously select new talents. Also, with the implementation of the military reform, the expansion of special volunteer officers and the increase in the number of special warrant officers should be appropriately allocated. As for the employment of special volunteer officers, special attention should be paid to their resumes and character. They should be admitted only after a thorough review. We should step up precautions against the infiltration of communist elements.</p>
<p>Regarding the Military Budget: In view of the current state of Japan's finances and economy, the world often holds pessimistic views. However, we firmly believe that the people can bear this huge budget. Although the national finances have continuously increased a lot of deficit bonds in this extraordinary period, it is necessary to do so in order to save the current emergency. I hope that everyone can understand the current state of the national finances and the purpose of this budget, and strive to eliminate all kinds of waste and actively use it for appropriate military improvement and the supplementation of technical personnel.</p>
<p>Regarding the Support of the Entire People: In modern warfare, the most important thing is the total mobilization of the entire people, who can be the shield of national defense. Therefore, we should strive to mobilize all forces, expand and strengthen the organization of national defense associations and air defense associations in various places, actively explain the internal and external crisis situation, and ensure that the entire people can eliminate the import of foreign ideas under the command of the military and move forward under the mission of saving the country.</p>
<p>Reorganization of the Veterans' Association: Since the beginning of the war, veterans across the country have been able to rise up to serve the country, which is truly commendable. However, at this time, the Veterans' Association should reform all the pending issues and internal structure, strive to make up for its shortcomings, strengthen the spirit of military-civilian unity, thoroughly implement national salvation education, and make it more powerful to serve national defense.</p>
<p>Training of Students and Youth: Pure youth and students are often confused by foreign ideas. You should provide them with special education. In particular, students in higher schools need more active guidance. The system of reserve officers will soon be revised and implemented. Therefore, the student training in higher schools across the country must be reorganized. Especially, the persons in charge of the schools should strive to revitalize it and step up the supervision and guidance of student ideology. Youth are the most important part of the country's long-term plan. Youth training centers in various places must provide them with practical assistance and education. (Omitted below)</p>
<h3 id="e233">British House of Commons Passes the Bill to Ban Russian Imports on Third Reading <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>Effective for Three Months from the Date of Publication</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Hopes It Will Not Be Implemented</p>
<p>British Lawyers Go to Moscow to Attend the Trial</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 6th: The bill to ban Russian imports was passed on the third reading in the House of Commons today by a vote of 291 to 41. Liberal Party members such as Samuel voted in favor on the third reading because Trade Minister Runciman announced an amendment stipulating that the ban would only be effective for three months from the date of publication and would be repealed if not continued after the expiration. The continuation of this ban would also require the consent of Parliament. Runciman, in response to questions from former Foreign Secretary Chamberlain, Liberal Party leader Samuel, and others, said that what needs to be understood now is that the power conferred by this bill can only be exercised when the detention of British engineers reaches a serious point. Foreign Secretary Simon concluded the debate on the bill, saying that he hoped that the bill would not be implemented, but that the possibility depended on the Russian authorities.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 6th: London lawyer Dunner, legal counsel for Vickers, will go to Moscow tonight to attend the trial of the arrested British engineers. The Russian authorities have now confirmed that the trial will open on April 10th. The Russian consul in London has issued a passport to Dunner, accompanied by a skilled Russian interpreter. Vickers has also authorized Mr. Monkhouse, the head of its Moscow branch, to hire lawyers to defend the engineers, who are also defendants. The Soviet Foreign Minister replied that one British lawyer could be allowed to attend the trial. London considered this unsatisfactory and is still making every effort to persuade the Soviet Union to allow the engineers to have British lawyers as consultants and assist them during the trial. Sir Paul, chairman of Vickers, said in London today that the Soviet Union had made a big mistake. He was particularly pleased that the engineers had received strict orders from the company not to get involved in the political or other disputes of the Soviet government.</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 6th: The bailers of the five British defendants from Vickers were notified today that they could inspect the detailed text of the charges tomorrow to prepare a defense. It is said that the defendants do not want to rely on the lawyers provided by the court and will hire lawyers from the members of the Bar Association.</p>

<p>According to the Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun, Osaka Ashihara Police Station detective Ishii, on the 27th of last month at 10 PM in Shinsekai, Naniwa Ward, noticed a man loitering suspiciously. Upon questioning, the man was identified as Tsukazaki Sachi, a resident of Ibaraki Prefecture. He had previously committed a crime and was sentenced to one year and six months of penal servitude. He had recently disguised himself as a soldier and infiltrated the Osaka Army Arsenal, plotting a bombing. Fortunately, his plan was detected in advance, averting a major disaster. The military police authorities, noting the recent surge in far-left activities and the current extraordinary circumstances, immediately detained the suspect at the Namba Military Police sub-station for strict investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e235">Japanese Intellectual Class Unemployed, No Relief Available <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>According to the Tokyo Kokumin Shimbun, the number of unemployed intellectuals in Tokyo Prefecture and Tokyo City is increasing daily. For emergency relief, last year there were 1,307,642 unemployed people, and the relief fund was 1,406,000 yen. This year, the number has increased to 1,527,700 yen, with the number of people reaching 1,176,500. The number of people who are relieved and employed daily is only 3,515, less than one-tenth of the unemployed. The actual number of unemployed is likely to be several times higher. Moreover, the number of new graduates from schools is increasing year by year, while the employment by government offices and city governments is very small. Many private companies are unable to provide appropriate placement. Therefore, from the 7th to the 8th year of the Showa era, the number reached 138,800, an average increase of approximately 2,381 people per day. According to actual estimates, the number of unemployed should increase by 3,185 people. Since the year before last, the number of unemployed has been increasing year by year. On September 1, Showa 6, it was 25,462; in December of the same year, it was 32,559; and in January of the 8th year, it was 35,744. The Tokyo City government has planned relief measures for the unemployed and set conditions, stipulating that for university graduates, the daily allowance is 1.5 yen during a certain probationary period; for vocational school graduates, it is 1.2 yen per day; and for secondary school graduates, it is 0.9 yen per day. Half of the salary burden is subsidized by the national treasury, and the other half is borne by the employing organization. However, private organizations are still not enthusiastic about the trial employment idea. Therefore, the number of unemployed from January 1st of this year to the present has reached 96,300. However, recently, due to the impact of the current situation, it has been easier for skilled workers to find employment in military factories. As for other unemployed people, there are no relief measures available.</p>

Italian merchant ships rank first, followed by British, Greek, Norwegian, and French ships.</p>

Therefore, there is great concern for her safety.</p>

<p>Reuters, Chicago, 6th - 14,000 students from various high schools in Chicago went on strike today to protest the overdue payment of teacher salaries. School authorities are not concerned that the strike will spread to other schools because the students' demonstration is out of indignation, and not as serious as "a slight feeling of spring fever."</p>
<h3 id="e239">Yu Hongjun Talks About Municipal Facilities <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>Factory Inspection Implemented in Concessions</p>
<p>Police Reform Difficult to Implement Immediately</p>
<p>Land Value Tax Collection Being Prepared</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency visited Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, today to inquire about various issues regarding municipal facilities. He was informed as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e240">Factory Inspection <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>According to Mr. Yu, after repeated discussions with Mr. Fessenden, Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, on the progress of factory inspections, agreement could be reached on the point of our assistance. However, regarding the method, they require us to send trained inspection personnel to be under the control of the concession authorities. However, the Factory Law was promulgated by the National Government, and the Municipal Government is ordered to implement it. This kind of request actually hinders our administrative power. Moreover, the citizens of the concession should naturally abide by the orders of the Chinese government and be protected by the Chinese government. Therefore, the administrative power of the Chinese government can naturally be implemented in the concession, so that the Chinese and foreign boundaries are treated equally. Because of this, there has not been a substantial result. According to the concession authorities, this issue will be handled in the amendment of the Yangjingbang Regulations at the upcoming annual meeting of Western taxpayers. However, the Yangjingbang Regulations also clearly stipulate that the amendment of the articles must also be approved by the Chinese government before it can take effect.</p>
<h3 id="e241">Police System <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>Former Director Wen had a proposal to reform the police system, but it was not implemented due to the winter defense period. Now, according to Mr. Yu, the reform of the police system has not yet reached the implementation stage. This is because the various districts of Zhabei are busy with consolidation and reconstruction, and at the same time, they want to strengthen the police force and increase training. Only after these two tasks are completed can the reform be implemented. As for the relocation of the Public Security Bureau to the old Shanghai County site, because the county site is currently being repaired, it will probably take some time.</p>
<h3 id="e242">Tax Collection <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>After the Director of the Finance Bureau negotiated with the concession authorities regarding the amusement tax, there has not been a substantial result, so it is still difficult to levy. The business tax is suspended. The preparation for the collection of land value tax has been fully completed. The date of commencement has not yet been determined, but it will definitely be realized soon.</p>
<h3 id="e243">Reconstruction Situation <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>Since the allocation of funds for the plan to revitalize the prosperity of the city, it has been actively implemented. The construction of main roads and municipal libraries and hospitals has been implemented in order. The progress is quite rapid. The municipal government building and various main roads in the city center area will also be completed separately. However, the entire project will have to be completed by the end of this year. Therefore, although the relocation of various agencies of the municipal government was previously expected to be realized in mid-July, judging from the actual situation, it will also be at the end of this year.</p>
<h3 id="e244">Cross-Boundary Telephone Contract to be Signed <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>Trial for One Year Before Long-Term Contract</p>
<p>The cross-boundary road construction telephone contract has been under discussion since last year, for more than half a year. Now, the Shanghai Telephone Company has obtained the consent of the two concession authorities, and the distribution of all the burden fees for obtaining operating rights has also been completely resolved. The signing procedures are also ready. However, there is still one issue that is being reported to the Ministry of Communications Telephone Bureau for instructions. The contract will be in both Chinese and English, with detailed route maps attached. The signatories will be Mr. Bader, Manager of Shanghai Telephone Company, and Mr. Xu Xueyu, Director of the Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, and Mr. Xu Peihuang, Director of the Public Works Bureau. Once the Ministry of Communications sends personnel to Shanghai, the contract can be formally signed within two or three days at the latest. This contract is still a temporary arrangement, with a term of one year. If the trial implementation is satisfactory in the future, a long-term contract will continue to be signed.</p>
<h3 id="e245">Whereabouts of Kong Xiangxi <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>Considering the Presidency of the Bank of China</p>
<p>Resolutely Declines the Post of Envoy to Italy</p>
<p>Finance Minister Song Ziwen resigned from his concurrent post as President of the Central Bank. The Central Political Conference decided that Kong Xiangxi should succeed him. Yesterday, Song visited Kong to persuade him to take the post, and Kong expressed his humility. This morning, the National Government's appointment was seen. Although Kong has not yet agreed to take office, after unanimous urging from all parties, he has agreed to consider it carefully. After a considerable period of time, he should be able to take office. As for the post of Envoy to Italy, Kong has decided not to take it.</p>
<h3 id="e246">Abolishing Taels and Changing to Yuan, Shanghai Merchants Comply with Convenience <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>Silver and Money Industry to Start Registering Forward Silver Notes Today</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance ordered the implementation of abolishing taels and changing to yuan, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has today announced to all industries to comply. The silver and money industry feels quite convenient. The Banking Association has started to register forward silver notes. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e247">Chamber of Commerce Announcement <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>Now, we have received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance, stating that the Ministry has now decided that from April 6th, all receipts and payments of public and private funds, as well as the signing of contracts, notes, and all transactions, must be uniformly changed to silver coins, and silver taels must no longer be used. For those that were originally stipulated to be received and paid in silver taels before this date, the standard in Shanghai should be to convert one silver tael of treasury yuan into one silver coin. The receipts and payments should be made in silver coins. In other places outside Shanghai, the treasury yuan should first be converted according to the Shanghai exchange rate on April 5th, and then the treasury yuan should be converted into silver coins. After this date, new contracts and notes, and the receipts and payments of public and private funds, and all transactions that still use silver taels, will be legally invalid. Those who hold silver taels may, in accordance with the regulations for the minting of silver standard coins, request the Central Mint to mint silver coins on their behalf, or send them to the local Central Bank of China and Bank of Communications to exchange for silver coins for circulation, in order to facilitate matters. In addition to posting this notice and distributing it to various industries, we have urgently telegraphed to inform you and request that you forward it to your subordinates for compliance. This notice.</p>
<p>[P Suitable for Both Chinese and Foreign&gt;</p>
<p>A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency met a leader of the silver and money industry this morning. According to him, after the Ministry of Finance's order to abolish taels arrived in Shanghai, member meetings were convened separately to decide on domestic and foreign measures. All incoming and outgoing silver tael funds were converted into silver yuan for transfer yesterday according to the rate of 715. The issuance of silver notes has been suspended. This matter happened suddenly, and foreign merchant banks initially found it difficult to receive and deliver. Now, foreign merchant banks have decided to convert the receipt and delivery of silver taels from Chinese merchants into silver yuan. Therefore, there is no difficulty at all, and it is actually more convenient. As for the conversion rate of 715, it is the legal price set by the government, and all industries abide by it uniformly, so there are no problems with silver tael transfers.</p>
<h3 id="e248">Registration <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>The Silver and Money Industry Association has decided to submit eight resolutions of the member meeting to the Ministry of Finance this afternoon for transfer to the judicial authorities for record. As for the forward silver tael notes that are due after April 15th, the Banking Association has decided to start registration tomorrow morning. After these notes are registered, the association will stamp a seal on the back of the note.</p>
<h3 id="e249">Increasing Unemployment Among Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>Reaching Over 284,000 People</p>
<p>Ministry of Industry and Commerce Formulating Relief Plan</p>
<p>In recent years, due to the impact of the appreciation of gold and the depreciation of silver, all businesses in various parts of Southeast Asia have shown extreme decline, especially the rubber and tin rice industries, resulting in our overseas Chinese residing in various parts of Southeast Asia being forced into unemployment. According to a survey by a reporter from the East China News Agency at the International Trade Bureau, in the past year, the total number of unemployed overseas Chinese who have returned to China from various British and Dutch possessions in Southeast Asia has reached 283,890, accounting for approximately three-tenths of the total number of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. Moreover, most of them are self-employed businessmen, and their total capital is no more than 1,000 yuan. Due to years of business failures, their funds have been almost completely lost. Moreover, the governments of various places in British and Dutch Southeast Asia are heavily taxing various rates. If the overseas Chinese are unable to pay, they are expelled and returned to China, resulting in unemployment. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce is now planning to investigate the unemployment of laborers, distributing forms for investigation to its subordinates. In addition, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Management Office is drafting a plan to relieve the unemployment of overseas Chinese and to encourage overseas Chinese to return to China to start businesses, and is submitting it to the Central Government for review and implementation. It is also ordering the Immigration Section to follow the precedent of immigration in various countries, collecting reference materials, and drafting an immigration law to meet the needs.</p>

<p>Arima to Return to Shanghai Around the 20th</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, Arawazawa Yoshihisa stayed at the Astor House Hotel. A reporter from the East China News Agency inquired with Minister Arino of the Japanese Embassy, who said that the two members of parliament, Tomomoto, and former Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Iwake Tokuryuko, who accompanied Arawazawa to Shanghai, went to Hangzhou for sightseeing yesterday morning and are scheduled to return this afternoon.

<p>The Accident Site is Near Xiaotang</p>
<p>More Than Ten Passengers in the Car Injured</p>
<p>At 12:40 PM yesterday, a tragic accident occurred near Xiaotang on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway when a Shanghai-Hangzhou public bus overturned. More than ten passengers in the car were injured. The details obtained by a reporter from the East China News Agency are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e254">Cause of the Accident <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway opened to traffic on October 10th last year, it has been very convenient for transportation. However, accidents have occurred from time to time. At 2:40 PM yesterday afternoon, a Shanghai-Hangzhou public bus picked up more than ten passengers in Minhang. While being driven by Zhu Liang, the bus had only traveled a few miles when, near Xiaotang, in an attempt to avoid a child, the driver steered the car into a ditch on the side of the road. He was unable to brake in time, causing the bus to overturn. The passengers in the car were all thrown about, suffering severe shocks, injuries, and bleeding. The windows of the bus were also shattered. After the accident, the villagers came forward to help the passengers out of the bus one by one.</p>
<h3 id="e255">Fortunately, No Deaths <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>However, all the passengers had bleeding limbs and back pain to varying degrees. The slightly injured passengers were not far from their homes, so they all walked home. Those who were more seriously injured were helped across the river by the villagers and sent to Minhang Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e256">Injury Investigation <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>This morning, a reporter from the East China News Agency drove to the accident site to investigate. The wrecked bus had already been repaired in Minhang. The body of the car was slightly damaged, and several pieces of glass were shattered. The damage is estimated to be around one or two hundred yuan. He also visited Mr. Huang Bingjun, the director of Minhang Hospital, to inquire about the condition of the injured. According to him, after the injured passengers arrived at the hospital, they were all slightly injured. After being bandaged, they were discharged from the hospital. Therefore, no one stayed in the hospital last night. The injured who arrived at the hospital were Zhou Moqing, Song Yunsheng, Liang Yungeng, Wang, and Shi Xiaoqin. Among them, Wang was more seriously injured.</p>

<p>Wu Junxuan Died in the Line of Duty</p>
<p>Injured Gang Member Captured</p>
<p>At around 5:00 AM today, just as dawn was breaking, a robbery occurred at the Jian Dao Bridge on Huining Road in Nanshi. The robbers opened fire, killing a police officer. A stray bullet accidentally injured a fellow gang member. The details are recorded on the left. Wu Junxuan, a 28-year-old Tianjin native, is a police officer at the Manufacturing Bureau Road Police Station in the Second District. He had only been on duty for six days. This morning, he was assigned to patrol the Jian Dao Bridge on Huining Road. At dawn, he saw three suspicious-looking individuals walking from east to west, talking as they walked, looking fierce and menacing. Knowing that they were not good people, he ordered them to stop. Just as he was about to step forward to search them, the robbers, knowing that they were guilty, preemptively struck. Two of the robbers rushed up and grabbed the police officer Wu's arms. The police officer immediately lost his ability to resist and could not escape. Another robber took out a pistol and shot at him, firing five shots in a row. Two shots hit him, with the bullets entering from the upper ends of his breasts on the left and right sides and exiting from his back, injuring his lungs. He immediately fell to the ground and died. A stray bullet injured a gang member named Jia (said to be from Yancheng). The robbers fled in a panic. The police officer on the next post heard the gunshots and rushed over to investigate. Seeing Jia running wildly, he knew what they had done and chased after him. He chased him all the way to Sanguantang, where he finally captured Jia. The rest escaped. Jia was escorted to the Second District Police Station, where it was found that he was seriously injured. He was immediately sent to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. Police were dispatched to the scene of the incident to collect five bullet casings from the ground. At the same time, the local land officials were ordered to report to the local court for an autopsy. Later, the prosecutor arrived at the scene and confirmed that the police officer Wu Junxuan had indeed died from gunshot wounds. He filled out a form ordering that the body be collected and prepared for instructions. It was found that the police officer's hometown had an elderly mother, a wife, and a five-year-old son, all of whom depended on the police officer for their livelihood.</p>

<p>Li Zikui, a 35-year-old Jiangyin native, lived at No. 23 Guanyinge. He usually worked as a porter on the Yantan pier. Yesterday, he and his companion Zhang Da went to a nearby small restaurant for a meal and bought a plate of puffer fish roe for fifteen copper coins. The two of them ate it together. After eating, when they returned home, Zhang Da died from poisoning first. Li was sent to Shanghai Hospital for treatment by car, but because he was deeply poisoned, it was impossible to save him. He died at 11:00 PM in the evening. What a tragedy!</p>

<h3 id="e259">Arawazawa is Coming! <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— Me</p>
<p>In recent days, the spring scenery has become brighter day by day, and the situation outside the pass is becoming more peaceful day by day. The comrades and brothers who are enthusiastic about "resolving to resist" are all very happy, and they cannot help but congratulate each other, shake hands, and say hello: "Thank you, thank you, this time it's another great success." From now on, we can announce that the world is at peace.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, at this time, Arawazawa, the friend from the friendly nation who is of the same culture and race, actually came to visit in this situation where the friendship between the two countries has always been grand and is about to become closer. It is really extremely coincidental.</p>
<p>Why is Arawazawa coming to China? Everyone knows that the reason is sufficient. It is not just for sightseeing, but also to visit "old friends." According to Arawazawa himself, this old friend is Comrade Wang Zhengting. Old friends meet old friends, of course, everyone is a comrade. Needless to say, his coming is harmonious!</p>
<p>Before this, I remember that Envoy Jiang was recalled to court and has not yet returned to his post. Although this may not have a cause-and-effect relationship with Arawazawa's visit to China, thinking about it together, one can get a glimpse of the grandness of the comings and goings of dignitaries.</p>
<p>However, Arawazawa's visit this time seems inevitable to be disappointing. The most obvious thing is the government's "resolute non-reception" (see the Central News Agency telegram of the 1st). However, it doesn't matter. The government will handle it officially. The friendship between comrades is always genuine. So, in the future, "old friends" will gather together, chatting and laughing, which is still very "reasonable." Moreover, the Japanese Foreign Ministry has already made a responsible statement: "The whole thing is a private action and does not carry a government mission." Of course, Arawazawa's visit does not necessarily require a grand reception from our government. As long as "old friends" and "comrades" accompany him on his travels, it will be very understanding and very in line with the so-called "everyone is one family, why bother with formalities?" Moreover, in the same telegram, Foreign Minister Luo "fears that there is a risk of blindness and will go to Shanghai to have Dr. Yan de perform surgery." Therefore, Arawazawa will not go to the capital, which is also not impossible.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the revolution, like the Central Government's "consistent policy that will never change," is also something that our struggling people can trust very much. Now, there is another resolute non-reception to show determination, which is really enough to tell the gods and demons and illuminate the sun and moon. It can be seen that this has nothing to do with rumors of direct negotiations, which even ghosts would not doubt.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, then the Beijing Workers' Union National Salvation Federation's request to the National Government not to receive Arawazawa in order to prevent rumors is the utmost nonsense.</p>
<h3 id="e260">Transcendental Occupation <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— Jingxian</p>
<p>I am unemployed, but I am not a vagrant.</p>
<p>The kind of work I do doesn't require much capital at all, and it's not included in the three hundred and sixty professions. Talking about investing capital to make profits, or making a huge profit from a small investment, it all looks like robbery to me. Snatching other people's money, swindling other people's money, desperately stuffing it into one's own pocket, that's shameful.</p>
<p>Some people say, if you don't spend much capital, are you a master of begging?</p>
<p>Bah, I wouldn't even look at that. I wouldn't secretly become a bastard pickpocket either.</p>
<p>If a person has two hands like nail rakes, why worry about food and drink? I've also had thousands upon thousands of colorful bills in my pockets, and I've even had a courtesan as a concubine. What haven't I done? Little ones, jumping and jumping with all their energy, trembling and trembling, bah, what's so rare about that? If I hadn't watched thousands upon thousands of silver dollars slip through my fingers, who would dare to look down on me today?</p>
<p>Well, I've seen through everything now. Wealth and glory are nothing but that. Spending the whole day bragging and boasting, sticking out your stiff leg, you can't take it into the coffin, so what's the point?</p>
<p>I am unemployed, but I am not a vagrant.</p>
<p>My life is somewhat like those little guys who go to the theater and hang out with women. I don't feel any energy until I go out at three or four in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Every day at three or four in the afternoon, I take a bamboo stick about two feet long, carry two yellow pockets, and walk along the road like an old woman going on a pilgrimage, bowing all the way. No, damn it, what bodhisattvas, what lords, pretending to deceive people, even though I'm poor to the bone, I won't even give them a second glance. I am looking for cigarette butts on the road.</p>
<p>I look for cigarette butts on the road, only filling twelve pockets a day. When two pockets are full, I take them to that fellow Zhang Si's shop. That fellow Zhang Si is really a good friend. Two pockets of cigarette butts, no more, no less, regardless of quality, he always gives me half a string of cash. Eight coppers, I exchange for a meal and a drink. Eight coppers, I save for tomorrow's food and drink. As for the extra, haha, speaking of which, I perk up. Red pills, I don't like to smoke. You're welcome. Opium paste is enough for me to enjoy day and night.</p>
<p>I don't like to look for them at the tram station. Those skinflints who ride the tram like to puff on cigarettes until their lips are swollen before they throw away the cigarette butts. If they don't do that, they won't be able to sleep all night. It's even less use looking in front of the bank. Those who go in and out of that bank, each one has to be weighed on a scale to see how heavy they are, and they are even more hopeless than me. Never in their lives will a cigarette butt as thick as the sky fall from their dog mouths.</p>
<p>Movie theaters, theaters, San Dong Yi Pin, No. 181, in front of these places, there's gold all over the ground, as long as your two nail rakes are willing to move. The little guys in their nice Western suits look like devils from behind, holding women with big butts, jumping and jumping, trembling and trembling, going in and out, as if they can't take their cigarettes inside, so they throw them away at the door. I pick them up with my big bamboo chopsticks, damn it, at least an inch long. White tin foil is the minimum, and there are plenty that I don't even know the names of. Mei Li Brand, White Gold Dragon, bah, Chinese goods. Picking up Chinese cigarette butts is hopeless. I don't like to smoke Chinese cigarettes.</p>
<p>I am unemployed, but I am not a vagrant. I don't become an official, I don't do business, I don't steal, I don't rob, I don't swindle, I don't beg. I do something that doesn't deceive heaven and earth, doesn't deceive my ancestors, and is not included in the three hundred and sixty professions. White rice, brown rice, no need to worry, damn it, it's more comfortable than anything else.</p>
<p>That young fellow Wang Xiaoliuzi went to Huangpu to jump in the river the day before yesterday, what a fool. He was born with a pair of nail rakes, how could he not find food and drink? Half a string a day, without spending a penny, it's all mine, haha.</p>

<h3 id="e261">April Fool's Day <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— Xi</p>
<p>April 1st is the Westerners' "April Fool's Day." According to Western customs, on this day each year, one can "tell lies" and "fool" friends without being considered "insulting." However, the origin of this matter is unverifiable.</p>
<p>Some say: Westerners "lie" and are allowed to "tell" lies, and even specially set up a "holiday" for it, which is tantamount to promoting a cunning style. If this style persists, with mutual deception and mutual fooling, can the morality and people's hearts still be inquired about? Our noble country still hangs the golden signboard of "Land of Propriety and Righteousness" and "Integrity as the Foundation." Therefore, there used to be as many as twenty-four solar terms, and now, due to the eastward spread of European customs, we have added "Women's Day," "Children's Day," "Teachers' Day," "Labor Day," "Anti-Smoking Day," and so on. However, we do not popularize the April Fool's Day, and even the highly Westernized Chinese rarely inquire about it, fearing that it conflicts with the golden signboard, and there is a difficult dilemma of "difficult to comply with."</p>
<p>It is not known that although our noble country does not have an officially determined and promulgated April Fool's Day in name, in reality, the generally clever countrymen, especially the generals who are responsible for defending the territory, have long been "taking the lead" in popularizing "lying." It's just that they have not formally "chosen an auspicious day to open" and clearly stipulated which day is the holiday.</p>
<p>Before the loss of Rehe, they telegraphed the whole country, expressing "determination to resist" and issuing statements, expressing "vowing to defend the territory to the death." When it was lost, they said, "This was expected" and "It is not difficult to counterattack"!</p>
<p>The Southwest authorities, regarding the military expedition to resist Japan, I heard that they have already decided on a specific plan and have conducted a swearing-in ceremony. However, the words "going north immediately" are like the wonderful use of "long-term resistance," not afraid of wearing through as many as 470 million pairs of eyes!</p>
<p>"Punishing the puppet state," "recovering lost territory," "counterattacking Chengde," have oiled the mouths of important people and made the ears of the people of the country tired, almost completely becoming a modern myth of the great Republic of China in the 20th century that has oiled mouths and tired ears!</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. XX is also singing loudly: "Before the end of this year, the lost territory in the Northeast can definitely be restored." A certain member of the Central Committee also predicted that "Japan will definitely have a major revolution within ten years." The affirmative tone seems to be more accurate than Yuan Tiangang's Tui Bei Tu and Liu Bowen's Shao Bing Ge.</p>
<p>In other cases, the Supervisory Yuan once impeached a certain official, but what was the result of the conviction? It is often like a stone sinking into the sea. Shops falsely claim to be selling domestic goods, but in reality, they are selling enemy goods; hanging up signs for quitting smoking medicine, but actually selling opium; boasting greatly about sacrificing capital, but adding a large promotional fee to the price of goods. Everything, everything, is to the best of our ability to "lie" and gather the great achievements of "fooling" compatriots. For 360 days a year, almost every day, many people are "lying" and "fooling" compatriots, which is no different from celebrating the Eastern-style "April Fool's Day" every day!</p>
<p>But keep in mind: Westerners only have April 1st, keeping in mind the warning of being fooled. Our country has to listen to the nonsense of "just speaking casually" all year round, and it is impossible to guard against it. This is obviously because we have been fooled. I don't know if we should imitate the Westerners and regard it as a great insult, which has led to the other party's "deep-rooted" bad habits!</p>
<p>Clerks' Correspondence</p>
<h3 id="e262">The True Meaning of Marriage <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I am a weak woman of seventeen—not a clerk—I don't think you will reject my request, right? My father unfortunately passed away last year, and now there is only a loving mother and a weak younger brother at home. When I was twelve years old, my father arranged a marriage for me. At that time, I didn't understand anything, and everything was decided by my parents. The other party is now twenty-five years old and works as a partner in a shop. Although his monthly income is small, he knows how to be frugal. His appearance is ordinary, but his temperament is mild. All of this was told to me by my mother. In my heart, I am somewhat unwilling to marry. There are three reasons for my unwillingness: (1) the age difference is eight years, (2) the other party's family has no permanent property, (3) the wedding is scheduled for the end of this year, so I want to cancel the engagement, but there are also three difficulties: (1) my mother is quite in favor of it. If I resolutely oppose it, it will definitely make my mother unhappy, and I will also be uneasy, (2) photos and birth dates have been exchanged during the engagement, and there is a matchmaker as a witness, (3) after canceling the engagement, whether choosing another match can be more satisfactory than the previous one, I am not sure! I have no decisiveness—I rely entirely on you, sir—to give me a satisfactory answer in the newspaper.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Luo Yuping, a weak woman, April 3rd</p>
<p>乂　　乂　　乂　　乂　　乂</p>
<p>Editor's note: Blind marriages are now criticized by the general public. If Ms. Luo has realized that the other party has aspects that are "unworthy of being a partner," then she may as well raise the issue of canceling the engagement. The law also provides considerable protection because this has not been done with the consent of the person. However, judging from Ms. Luo's letter, although her father arranged the engagement for her five years ago, she has not even met the other party. Therefore, although Ms. Luo raises three reasons for her unwillingness, we believe that they are all superficial unwillingness and not unwillingness based on genuine understanding. Let's first study these three reasons:</p>
<p>Regarding the first point, in ancient times, "men marry at thirty and women marry at twenty"; according to physiology, the couple should also follow the principle that the woman is younger than the man, and the woman's appearance is easier to age than the man's. Therefore, we believe that the age difference is not a problem. As for the second point, we believe that we should not take "having permanent property or not having permanent property" as the standard, but should take "whether or not there is self-reliance ability" as the standard. We deeply agree with the third point. Ms. Luo may use her young age as an excuse and ask her mother to ask someone to discuss with the other party and postpone it for a year or half a year. During this year and a half, first establish a kind of friendly acquaintance (but do not let the concept of "already engaged" be preconceived), and then carefully observe the other party's temperament, ability, and other aspects. This way, it can be more real than what you hear. At that time, if you find that the other party does have aspects that are "unworthy of being a partner," then raising the issue of canceling the engagement will not make the "difficulty" a "difficulty." If you can get along well with each other, then during this year and a half of friendship, the seeds of love will grow, and the result will be a satisfactory marriage. Because the true meaning of marriage is built on "love."</p>

<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Wu Yi had no siblings, and he regarded Miss Mao with as much joy and care as if she were his own little sister, often praising her endlessly in front of his wife, Miss Liu. Miss Liu's response each time was always a mysterious smile, but she absolutely did not restrict Wu Yi from going to the Wang family. She still quietly and patiently took care of the household affairs, unknowingly planting the seeds of Wu Yi's later epiphany.</p>
<p>"What? Isn't she home today?" Miss Mao loved music the most, and she was especially good at playing the piano. Wu Yi always came to Yu Lin's house at about 6:30 every day, as if he had made an appointment with her. Similarly, she would start playing her favorite Western music on the Pia Xiana from 6:15 every day until Wu Yi pushed the door in to stop her. Today, Wu Yi arrived on time as usual, but the sound of the piano was silent, making him hesitate outside the door, not daring to go in.</p>
<p>"The young mistress is sick! She's lying upstairs!" He finally went in, and bumped into an old nanny, who gave him a report that was actually not surprising, but which he considered to be very surprising.</p>
<p>He immediately felt another layer of hardship. "Lying upstairs?" Upstairs was her bedroom. Going up would inevitably seem inappropriate to onlookers, but not going up, he didn't have that decisive courage! He was like a new soldier about to go to the front line, hesitating, sometimes standing up, sometimes sitting down. No matter how careless a person was, they could definitely see his morbid state clearly.</p>
<p>"Uncle! Haha...!" Yu Lin's three-year-old child, Xiao Lin, suddenly came down from upstairs, hugged his Auntie Jin, and unexpectedly conveyed Miss Mao's words, saying that she was inviting Young Master Wu to come up.</p>
<p>Wu Yi finished a flight of twenty or thirty stairs in just two jumps.</p>
<p>"Sister-in-law... little friend!" He stood under a purple-red curtain, both surprised and delighted, pausing slightly, planning to formally call out "sister-in-law," but he was unwilling, and after saying one word, he stopped, still calling out softly according to the title he had predetermined in his heart. "What? Are you sick? Do you have a fever? Did you catch a cold? Yu has gone to Nanjing, why didn't you take care of yourself!"</p>

<h3 id="e266">George Raft's Inversion of All Women (Part 1) <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Rong</p>
<p>One of the Most Sought-After Men by Women After the Death of Rudolph Valentino</p>
<p>Anyone who knows a little about the anecdotes of the film industry can remember the grand funeral of Rudolph Valentino after his death; the mourning and honor after the death of a great president could not even reach half of it. It goes without saying that Valentino was admired by women during his lifetime and was besieged by female crowds everywhere. Now, Hollywood has a second Valentino; his appearance and demeanor are almost identical to Valentino. This new star is named George Raft. Since he showed his skills in "Scarface," he has already caused a sensation among movie fans across the United States, who all say that Valentino has been resurrected. Raft was already a close friend with Valentino during his lifetime. Although one was born in Mexico and the other in New York, USA, they were able to meet in one place and work together for many years, and the two of them looked alike, and those who saw them suspected that they were brothers. It can also be said that they were a match made in heaven.</p>
<p>Later, Valentino gave up his dancing career and entered the film industry during his lifetime. At that time, he persuaded Raft to go to Hollywood with him, because not only could they play brothers on the screen, but also act as his double on the screen, and no one would recognize him. Unexpectedly, Raft did not want to succeed because of others, and he was unwilling to give up his dancing career, so he broke up with Valentino. Now that he has returned to Hollywood, he is separated from Valentino by the grave, and he can't help but feel a sense of vicissitudes.</p>
<p>Raft is also besieged by crazy women everywhere, similar to Valentino during his lifetime. Although Raft has bodyguards, secretaries, servants, etc., he still cannot prevent women from harassing Raft. Whether it is at the train station, hotel rooms, theater entrances, or around his car, they are surrounded by infatuated women: sometimes they even take advantage of people's unpreparedness and break into his bedroom, asking for a kiss; although this is said to be an endless blessing, it also makes him restless and has no freedom or fun. In addition to signing autographs and inscriptions, those who ask him for souvenirs also want to snatch his hat, handkerchief, buttonhole, buttons on his clothes, and shoelaces on his shoes. One day, Raft came out of a theater in the Tituo Lawi area and was surrounded by many women, who tore his clothes. By the time the police rescued him into the car, his upper body clothes had disappeared, and his trousers were also torn to pieces.</p>
<p>Valentino had a similar experience in Boston before. At that time, a group of women surrounded him at the theater entrance. By the time Valentino broke through the siege, he had almost nothing left on his body except for a few scars and blood marks. Now Raft no longer dares to walk through the main entrance of the theater, and must sneak out from the side door after the crowd has dispersed. Sometimes he sleeps in the theater room all night, and there are still naughty women who climb up the fire escape to meet him. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e267">Review of "The Old House Mystery" A Dangerous Affair <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>In the past six months, "horror" films have indeed catered to the preferences of the general public and have achieved great success. Therefore, "The Old House Mystery," which was shown at the Carlton yesterday, attracted a lot of audiences.</p>
<p>It tells the story of a friendly patrolman and a reporter who both meet a girl. The reporter breaks into the girl's house at night to steal a necklace, intending to use it to get closer to the girl. Unexpectedly, at that time, a senior of the girl died and said in his will that all the property would be returned to the girl, but the girl must still retain the jewelry necklace she already had when accepting the inheritance. At this time, the reporter and the patrolman planned to return the necklace, but it was stolen again. So they went to the old house owned by the girl's elder to investigate, and after several twists and turns, they finally recovered the pearl. As soon as the case came to light: the reporter and the girl also fulfilled their long-cherished wish.</p>
<p>In the screenwriter's purpose, in addition to describing the harm of inheritance, which can make clansmen become enemies, it is only to use the color of terror to call. The meaning of the play is very shallow.</p>
<p>The whole film is performed entirely in a comedic way. Therefore, its horror can only be regarded as a part of the insertion. However, it cannot be regarded as a comedy, because it has a good丨rationalized丨plot. The depiction of love aspects, in addition to the final kiss, there is nothing. Columbia is a new company, and I can only consider this product to be a newly emerging comedy with a unique style. Indeed, this film has a very special and novel meaning.</p>
<p>The plot is long and the film is short, so in addition to telling the story, it is difficult to contain a large amount of expression. Jack Holt</p>
<h3 id="e268">Soviet Film "Storm Over Asia" Premieres Today <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>It is now known that the Soviet film "Storm Over Asia," the most famous work of the Soviet Union, will start screening at the Mingzhu Grand Theater on Fusheng Road today. It is rumored that the outside world initially rumored that the film would premiere at the Shanghai Grand Theater. After investigation, this was not true, because the film strongly criticized modern oppressors. The entrance of the theater is right in the concession, and there may be various inconveniences. Therefore, it was decided to arrange it at the Mingzhu Grand Theater in the completely Chinese area for official release. As for the price level, the theater only sells for a small amount of three-fifths of a dollar in order to seek popularity. This is the first time that Soviet films have been sold at such a low price.</p>
<p>The patrolman played by Jock Holt has a complete gentlemanly demeanor, and his silent performance is also top-notch. In the whole film, he is more than capable of being a leader. However, there is nothing particularly exciting, and everyone except him in this film is a supporting role (there is no supporting actor). The performances are generally good, and most of them are extremely humorous characters, which breaks the dullness of "terror."</p>
<p>The light is good. The photography is very mediocre, and many shots are taken from the same position, which is very monotonous. There are countless funny words in the dialogue, so it is not annoying. There is slight noise in the sound, which seems to be a problem with the projector. In terms of technology, the advantage of this film is the tight organization and editing, which adds a lot of horror and jokes, making it more colorful. The setting is ordinary and does not reach the level of mystery and greatness.</p>
<p>The biggest flaw of this film is that the expression is not enough. There are many characters and things that make viewers unable to understand. There are also minor loopholes, such as the scarcity of guns, etc., which need not be discussed in depth.</p>
<p>"A Scene in First Love" will be released at the Paris Grand Theater soon</p>

<p>— Mobo Feng</p>
<p>Southern Film Company was founded by Cantonese actor Xue Juexian. The film "White Gold Dragon" commissioned to Tianyi Company has been around for a long time, and the entire film has been completed. It was sent to the Film Censorship Committee for inspection a few days ago. Unexpectedly, it was not approved due to inconsistent language in the film. Now Xue Juexian and his wife Tang Xueqing will return to Guangdong together, so the release of "White Gold Dragon" will be a long way off.</p>

<h3 id="e270">Reading "Morning of the Metropolis" and Speaking of "City Nights" <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— Shadow</p>
<p>Rummaging through a movie special issue from several days ago, I stumbled upon an article that talked about "Morning of the Metropolis" and then went on to "City Nights," which couldn't help but make me smile wryly.</p>
<p>Let's not talk about whether "City Nights" or "Morning of the Metropolis" was a success or failure because! When both films premiered, they both received whole-page criticisms, and the critics and audiences understood very well.</p>
<p>If it weren't for someone as ignorant as Mr. "Wan," then every reader who cares about movies would surely know whether "Morning of the Metropolis" and "City Nights" started filming two or three months apart, and whether "Morning of the Metropolis" stopped filming for several months in between, waiting for "City Nights" to come out so they could imitate it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the "path of light" in "Morning of the Metropolis" was not clearly implied, while the "path of light" in "City Nights" can only be let Mr. Wan himself "struggle forward" on.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: If Mr. Shadow knows the order in which "City Nights" and "Morning of the Metropolis" were produced and the time between them, he can refute Mr. "Wan's" theory based on facts; but to deem Mr. "Wan" as "ignorant" just because he doesn't know the order in which the film companies produced the two films is extremely uncharitable. Moreover, since we have opened a "Public Opinion" column, it is intended to give movie audiences a place to express their opinions. Opinions vary, and no one should be forced to agree. We hope readers can understand this point and not turn this column into a battlefield. (Unsigned)</p>

<p>— Zhang Guan</p>
<p>"First Love" is a valuable work that embodies the true meaning of love. It tells the story of a duke who falls in love with a girlfriend. Later, this girlfriend is torn between two lovers, and the duke is willing to sacrifice himself to show his pure love. Although the plot is simple, it is quite tortuous and interesting. The main actors, Ronald Colman, Merle Oberon, and Josette Day, are all quite successful. The whole play is well-paced and full of interest. It premiered in Paris on the 7th.</p>

<p>They left the Ferris wheel, strolling around, seeming not to notice the crowds of people. "What would you like to do now?" Pantoff asked.</p>
<p>"Take me to see your newspaper office," Maggie suggested. Pantoff hesitated, telling her that there were too many colleagues there, which was very inconvenient, making Maggie feel a sudden chill. Didn't he want his friends to see her? she thought.</p>
<p>"I would most like my colleagues to see you!" Pantoff said firmly. "But before we go there, I want you to promise me one thing!"</p>
<p>"What is it?" Maggie asked blankly.</p>
<p>"That is! Tonight or tomorrow, you will marry me," he said. This made Maggie even more confused. She asked him what the reason was. "Because," Pantoff, at least very humbly, said depressingly. "My past life has been too despicable... I never thought I would genuinely treat a woman sincerely... So, Maggie, if they see you with me, they will gossip about you. But if you marry me..."</p>
<p>Maggie stared blankly. It seemed that everything was shrouded in darkness. Finally, she said dejectedly, "I don't think I want to go to the newspaper office anymore. There's probably nothing good to see there."</p>
<p>"Would you like to take a car ride and feel the wind, go to the place where we were last night?" Pantoff forced a smile.</p>
<p>"Okay," Maggie's voice had a hint of bitterness.</p>
<p>In Emeline's bedroom, Wayne and Emeline stood closely embracing each other.</p>
<p>"I still can't believe I've had such an amazing encounter," Wayne said, his arm reaching out to embrace her.</p>
<p>Emeline returned his kiss. Then, deftly, she freed herself from his embrace to turn on the electric light.</p>
<p>"This is our last night, Wayne," she said. There was an irreversible meaning in her tone.</p>
<p>Wayne was suspicious. "You can believe," he protested bravely. "There are still countless sweet nights for us to enjoy in the rest of our lives. You can't think that I'll let you slip away now." Suddenly, Emeline, standing in front of the window, turned her back to him, and he couldn't help but shout, "Why, Emeline? What have I done wrong?" (To be continued)</p>
