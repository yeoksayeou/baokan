<p>會塲公報　十九國委員會發表簡略公報如下、「十九國委員會頃於今晨開會、由瑙威代表蘭奇主席、國聯會秘書長德魯蒙當向委員會報告履行任務情形、因渠曾受委託、向日本代表團通告十九國委員會對於日本最後建議之意見、及委員會所决定採用之程序故也、德魯蒙謂彼曾於一月二十日通告中國代表團、謂委員會因欲迎合日本政府之願望、正繼續考慮將决議案及理由說明書加以修正、又謂現有理由可以相信日本代表團正準備提出他項建議云、十九國委員會嗣乃獲得結論、以爲國聯會秘書長所提出之報告、對於原來局勢毫未加以變更、因此决定繼續討論報告書所應包含之原則、俾調解程序最後失敗時、得依照盟約第十五條第四項、將此項報告書提付大會、此層經十九國委員會乃令起草委員會準備報告書最後一部分、聽候取决、起草委員會定於明晨開會、」（六日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）今日十九國委員會會議時、對於倘當事國一造拒絕接受建議後、則盟約第十六條（現定制裁條欵）是否即自動提出一層、亦曾略加討論、但大都同意於星期六秘書長德魯蒙提出之解釋、謂盟約各欵彼此獨立、必須分别解釋、蓋各代表多認此項解釋爲正確、可資依循、但又同意商定對於當事國不接受建議後之國聯行動、不宜預先决定、西班牙代表馬達利亞加曾聲稱、委員國不應於未抵橋時、先作過橋之謀、又桑特勒提議、建議中應列入設置委員會監督建議之實施一項、德代表方凱勒反對此舉、宣稱盟約第十五欵第四項旣未有此項委員會之規定、吾輩以就條文範圍内行動爲宜、當時會塲中亦多贊同此意、桑氏提議遂遭拒絕、此外又在實際上决定對於國聯大會與對於中日兩國之重要建議、應行列入委員會報告書一章之内、再經長時間討論後、又决定請美俄兩國道義的與積極的擁護國聯大會所通過之建議、但委員會報告書内不明提美俄國名、僅統稱爲「第三者」、並决定委員會在得國聯大會通過以前、尙不能即時進行獲得美俄合作之企圖、英外務次官艾登與德代表方凱勒並勸起草委員會草擬建議、應審愼而温和、力求其符合蘇俄與美國所已表示之意旨、（六日國民社）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）今日法代表馬錫格里於討論不承認原則時、曾明白指示此種聲明、其意義即謂國聯會員國與滿洲國無論如何、不能有合作情事、並鄭重申述採用此項政策後、其意義即謂各會員國不能給予滿洲國財政助力、法代表作此非當明確解釋後、其他十五國代表皆默表同情、無一發言、</p>
<p>按日本雖堅决反對國聯此舉、曾屢次作退出國聯之恫嚇、伹各國爲維持國聯地位計、卒不爲日人恫嚇所動、今晨除墨西哥·巴拿馬·與比利時三國未出席外、到會各代表無一作反對語者、同時委員會又議决接受李頓報告書中十項建議、爲委員會向國聯大會建議之基礎、按今日之會、西班牙前代表馬達利亞加亦偕現任代表蘇路泰一同出席、頗引起外間之議論、蓋前傳馬氏因去年十一月間在會塲有逾越訓令範圍、作過於反日之語情事、爲政府所不滿、以故退避賢路者也、（六日國民電）</p>

<p>（東京）日國會下院外交分科會、因昨日松本質問内田外交部長、日本果退出國聯或屬宣傳、内田外長要求秘密會、今日下午二時四十分國會應請開秘密會、席上内田報告約十分鐘、據内田所報告、大要爲了日政府以不退出國聯爲原則、故派松岡往日内瓦、參加保留中之第十五條討論、國聯雖欲援用第四項作勸告、政府令代表極力阻止、亦不外於此、如一切努力不見效、若勸告文内容非大不得了、則僅令代表還國、放任其自然推移、勸告文滿責難日本太甚、不留餘情、爲欲顧全國家面子、維持恫嚇宣傳之威信、則不得不退出國聯、故日外交部對付國聯政策、乃以「不退出」爲原則、「退出」屬於不得已之事云、（六日華聯電）</p>

<p>日海軍當局之意見</p>
<p>（東京）據日本海軍當軸意見、日本之退出國聯、未必即爲日本亦退出軍縮會議之解、其理由有二、一爲軍縮會非盡國聯會員國所組織、非會員國亦參加之、二爲日本海軍新近提議之性質、尙未向軍縮會說明之、若日本此時退出軍縮會、則世人將責日本對於軍縮未有誠意也、（六日路透電）</p>

<h3 id="c71">英國對華之態度與妥洽主義者乃 <a href="#c71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>中日糾紛中。英國之對華態度。常陷於矛盾百出不可捉摸之象。時而親華。時而袒日。時而模稜兩可於其間。最近西門外相在日内瓦反對否認「滿洲國』之後。忽復以𢌞避出度聞矣。</p>
<p>列强之對華政策。吾人若僅就政治上表現作枝枝節節皮相之觀察。誠若恍惝莫測。若就其經濟上利害關係窺及其核心。固仍有可尋之條理。一言以蔽之。則爲維持與策進其在華之權益。以肆其侵略而已。</p>
<p>維持與策進在華權益之道如何。力所能及。則出以强硬之手腕。力所不及。乃不能不委屈求全而出於妥。洽前者有若年來之日本。後者則目下之英國。實爲其顯例。英帝國自大戰以還。殖民地動搖之狀態。日甚一日。瀰漫全印度之革命運動。固足使英倫政治家焦思竭慮。晝夜匪寗。而愛爾蘭之反側。患在肘腋之間。尤令其寢食不安。手足失措。凡諸種切。舉足使英國感於殖民地治理之不易。而目下更無餘力以經營新殖民地。亦事之顯而易見者。英國自民十五以還。交回漢潯租界。退還庚子賠欵。要皆爲其對華採取温和的妥洽政策之明證。此項政策。實爲英國對華唯一有利之途徑。吾人甚信其捨此以外。不能更有所企圖也。</p>
<p>此種温和的妥洽政策。其命意所在。主要的所以求長江流域之安寗。使英國在華之商務利益。可以維持於不敗。易言之。即英國過剩之商品。可藉此以爲傾銷之尾閭。此項關係。在英國放棄金本位。商品成本减低。長江流域及華南一帶。因抵制日貨之結果。英貨漸取日貨市場而代之之際。尤有積極維持之必要。然惟其如此。於是。一面須博華人之好感。而一面復須設法使日帝國主義之軍事行動。不致擴大其範圍。於是。對華妥洽之外。不得不復有對日之妥洽。然中日糾紛。方在高潮。於是此周旋兩方之英國。不免左右爲難。其表現於外交方面者。遂不能不矛盾百出。而幾於無以自解矣。</p>
<p>吾人于此。當可曉然于英國對華之立塲矣。其一則英國者。無所愛于中國民族者也。英國之欲者。爲一和平落後之中國市塲。可以供其長時期之剝削。而中國民族所遭受之任何奇恥大辱。决非其所計及。其二。則英國對于日人之併呑東省。固非其所願。然在軍事上。旣無餘力以與日人在遠東角一日之短長。而因。利害關係原極幾微之東三省。引重戰事。以擾亂其經濟勢力大本營所宜之長江流或。　爲得不　此。故　與日人妥洽。以　　　長江及華北華南之安寗外。實無其他更妥善之辦法。其三。則英國之對日妥洽。原爲迫不獲已之舉。對日妥洽之目的。現在保持在華之市塲。固决不敢于引起華人之惡感。否則不幸因此而引起排英之風潮。則所以保持市塲者。適以危害市塲。英人之愚。將不可及矣。</p>
<p>由此觀之。則英國之于我國。縱無領土之野心。而在客觀上。終不出于設定勢力圈。以肆其經濟上之宰割。瓜分豆剖。不過易其方式而行。列强對于弱小民族之政策。一脈相承。無能外此。吾人固無足爲英人怪。所可痛者。則國内之妥洽主義者。其立塲乃無以異于英人耳。和平之市塲。爲英國之所需。然亦即爲我國買辦階級之所需。東三省之淪亡。無與于英國。然似亦無損于以長江流域爲根據地之買辦階級。苟且偷安。對于民族所受之奇恥大辱。視若無覩。買辦階級之妥洽主義者。胥無異于英人焉。于是列强與買辦階級之合以謀我。彰彰明甚矣。</p>
<p>最近事實之所昭告于吾人者。則責英之空氣方興。英國已倐變其袒日之態度。吾人對于以辱國賣國之方式以求保持其一己之地位與利益者。必須使其了然于終將受人民之裁判。堅决抗爭之高潮旣起。妥洽主義者。自必匿跡銷聲矣。</p>

<p>零星捐募飛機不能救國</p>
<p>應由國民自動剏立空軍</p>
<p>徵集五百個捐募的單位</p>
<p>限本年底捐募五千萬元</p>
<p>漢口通信、平漢路委員長何競武、日昨在該路紀念週演講組織國民空軍之必要、茲紀詞如次、諸位同仁、我們的肩上、有兩個萬鈞的責任、一個·是如何把平漢辦好、一個·是如何救國、關於本路的、平常已說得很多、今天大家來討論一個國家重大問題、就是航空救國、救國何以重在航空、我請分條來講、</p>
<p>第一、空軍設備的必要、現代的世界、是空軍競爭的世界、中國自九一八以來、國難日甚一日、國人的救國主張很多、理論都是對的、只可惜沒人去實行、競武是個軍人、主張堅决抵抗、但是抵抗必須武力、我們的武力怎麽様、中國海軍軍艦只七八萬噸、日本的海軍軍艦噸位比我要多十倍以上、這種懸殊的比例、能否相抗、我相海軍中人、不會有良好答案、陸軍呢、中國陸軍的耐戰力、並不比日本弱、淞滬一戰、就可證明、雖然利器稍弱、精神是極好的、且陸地廣大、他的坦克車·平射砲·雖然利害、但是只能在平原使用、我們可以離開平地到山地去和他短兵相接、如現在的熱河、敵人就不能使用這種利器、日本每師團平時一萬二千人、戰時編制爲二萬五千人、他來二十個師團也只五十萬人、决不能分兵於中國各地、也决不能如日軍閥大言不慙的三小時佔領上海、兩星期佔領全華、只要我們與他作持久戰、勝利不一定屬日本、我們現在的陸軍數目、只怕比日本在東北的多幾十倍、所以說陸軍是可以作戰的、我們最大困苦就是空軍、日本空軍的實力、約在二千架、除去一部份留充國防、可以飛到中國的假定約有一千架、軍艦、坦克車·平射砲、都有地域的限制、獨有飛機可以到處飛行、我又沒有空軍、和他對抗、保護我們的制空權、假使一旦開戰、他可以拿他優勢的飛機在最短期内、掃蕩我們重要的城市、炸毀我們的火藥庫、消滅我們的兵工廠、破壞我們的交通線、使我們的陸軍運輪不　、槍彈沒法補充、失了固有的戰鬭力、那時我們才眞正痛苦、現在國人狂呼航空救國、就是這種原因、我個人以爲中國飛機雖不能飛到日本去轟炸、若以全力設法抵抗遠來的日機、是可以做得到的、譬如日本來一千架、我們若有五百架、就可以與他抵抗一下、淞滬戰事、日本陸軍着着失敗、海軍也於我無多損失、我們的吃虧、全在領空不能防禦、任意被日機自由投彈破壞、假使我們有與日本相當數量的空軍力、與之對抗、那日機就可驅逐、閘北不致有如此損失、陸軍必可取勝、所以我們要堅固我們的國防、惟一的要增加空軍力量、否則决不能維護我們的國脈、四萬萬同胞、人數雖多、精神雖好、也只能在敵人飛機下面、同歸於盡、國難迫在眉睫、我們想在最短期間擴充海軍、是經濟和時間所不許可的、只有多買飛機、國民的財力可以做到、</p>
<p>第二、過去空軍的缺點、中國現時非無空軍、何以不能與人抗戰、這固然是數量不敵、但最大原因、還是沒有組織系統、國家的飛機、成了軍人私有的護身器、只有私人能運用、政府無統制調遣的權柄、航空人員、也成了各個部分的戰士、不是國家的戰士、我們聽到飛鷹軍艦的轟沉聲、和四川飛機的爆炸聲、我們只有聽候亡國、現在國内的飛機塲的設備、也很簡陋、其他製造廠·彈藥廠·材料廠等、都還沒有準備、要是這種現像、不想設法改善、那就絕對談不到衛國、絕對談不到救國、</p>
<p>第三、過去捐贈飛機的失策、自淞滬戰後、國人已深深地感到空軍的重要、航空救國的呼聲、響遍全國、愛國志士、自行捐機於政府的很多、這固然是很好的、但是這種零星捐贈、陸續損毀、不能增加國防的實力、他的缺點、還是在沒有整個的組織和系統、空軍作戰、不比陸軍可以少勝多、完全是量數的比例、因爲飛機上的武器、有一定的限制、每架的戰鬥力、不能相去很遠、數量小的、當然被數量大的毀滅、去年淞滬戰箏、日機十二架襲擊杭州、我車以六架迎戰、結果雖然毀了他兩架、而我終於失敗、又在蘇州方面、我戰鬥機一架、由美人駕駛、被日機四架包圍、結果被擊落地、機師亦以身殉、所以空軍作戰、必須集中力量方能取勝、</p>
<p>第四、我們應如何組織空軍、空軍的重要和過去我國空軍的缺點、已如上述、我們今後應如何補救挽回呢、我以爲只有國民自動組織起來、我現在正式提議、由平漢發起國民空軍創立分會、向全國宣傳、造成五百個單位、每一單位捐機一架、我們平漢卽就今日起成立國民空軍創立會、全路員工、均爲分會會員、首先認捐飛機一架、定名爲平漢號、以次向全國各路各省市縣各法團各愛國志士勸捐、全國各路、愛國具有同心、假定大路獨捐一架、小路合捐一架、我鐵路界至省可得十個單位、此外郵政電報方面、至少可得五六架、海員工會、勢力雄厚、並可認捐若干架、合計交通界當可認二十個單位、中國有一千餘縣、大縣捐一架、小縣兩縣或三縣全捐一架、可得數百個單位、加以各省各特别市各機關各職業團體、以及急公好義的資產家、大家惕於亡國無日、慷慨解囊、我想五百個單位、不難募集、五百單位限二十二年底造成、同時成立國民空軍創立總會於上海、再請願政府將現有航空署、擴充爲空軍部、會同國民空軍創立總會、確立空軍建設之程序、積極準備航空材料廠·彈藥廠·飛行塲、限期訓練駕駛人員、每年至少五百人、這様一來、中國空軍才是有計劃有組織的、才是整個的非零星的、才是國民的非某人私有的、才是用於國防的非用於内戰的、有了這個偉大的力量、防禦敵機的襲擊、掩護我們的陸軍、那末、軍事方面、一定可以得到很大原效果、我的主張如此、天下興亡、匹夫有責、我愛國同人、如果認爲可行、大家就組織起來、以本星期爲對外宣傳之日、全體員司分組出發、向各處宣傳航空救國的意義、凡事只在人爲、只要努力去作、沒有做不到的、這個問題、關於國家的命脈、是各個人應盡的責任、救國要各個人自己去幹、切不可消極的希望别人去幹而反自己忘掉、更不可妄自菲薄、以爲藐躬無足重輕、平漢的男兒、來、把我們的熱血、連合全國同胞的熱血、組織國民空軍救國軍、與强敵作殊死戰、</p>

<p>濟南通信、魯省年來積極整頓民團、頗有成績、最近省府以外侮日亟、更將民團四區改爲五路、加緊訓練、民政廳長李樹春、上月又有民團興革辦法、摺陳省府、主張恢復民團舊額、一等縣三百、二等縣二百、三等縣一百、並添購槍枝、編練徒手大刀隊、以增厚民衆武力、此外對設置專管機關、發放民團薪餉辦法等、均有條陳、當交民財兩廳會核去後、據覆、以現在二十一年度未終、未便中途變更、俟二十二年度時、再行斟酌地方情形、呈請核辦、今日（三日）省府政務會議、再提該案討論、議决、照案通過、茲將該提案原文錄左、「秘書處報告、民財兩廳會呈稱、奉令以據民政廳摺陳關於民團之編組及訓練上、應行應革事項一案、飭即會核、等因奉此、遵經詳核、除關於會商各項外、所有摺陳㈠系統·㈡訓練·㈢編制·三項内所列各欵、尙無不合、似應准予如擬辦理、惟其中有應特别規定者三項、亦經會商妥協、謹將辦法分陳於下、㈠原摺所擬民團總部、擬設專管機關一節、擬由鈞府就主管科設一民團股、或指定職員數人、專辦民團事宜、㈡原摺所擬各縣民團薪餉、應由各縣呈解財政廳轉發各區指揮部、按月發放一節、此項辦法、輾轉解撥、困難殊多、應仍照現行辦法、由縣政府按月就近關發呈報總部及區部備案、㈢原摺所擬恢復各縣民團舊額、（即一等縣三百名二等縣二百名三等縣一百名）并添購槍械、編練徒手大刀隊一節、現在各縣民團數額薪餉、已經鈞府核定、編入二十一年度縣地方預算、年度未終、未便中途變更、應仍照本年度預算辦理、俟二十二年度時、再行斟酌地方情形、呈請核辦、以上三項、經一再商榷、意見相同、是否有當、理合呈請核示、如蒙核定、即祈通令施行等情、應如何辦理、請公决、一」</p>

<p>現被各軍大舉圍勦</p>
<p>成都通信、供匪賀龍·鄺繼勛·徐向前三部、在陜邊煤旣不能立脚、乃乘川局混亂時機、向四川進攻、當以一部由陜趨川北進展、同時還有一部分在城口巴東活動、進攻川北的主力是徐向前、在城口巴東活動的是賀龍鄺繼勛、這兩股力量合起攏來、目的是在攫取整個的川北、當時四川軍閥、是輕視了其匪的勢力、及城口通江等縣失陷後、纔吃驚不小、飛調軍隊防堵、</p>

<p>謂始終未變絕交主張</p>
<p>决不致引起世界大戰</p>
<p>前外交部長陳友仁、前晚由歐返滬後、外間對陳氏此次突然歸國、頗多揣測、昨日下午六時、陳氏在其西愛咸斯路寓次、接見中西各報社記者、陳氏表示暫不晉京、亦不願担任何種職務、至對日絕交主張、始終未變、茲分遽其談話如次、</p>
<h3 id="c89">倦遊今歸來 <a href="#c89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>記者首詢陳氏此交回滬、有無任務、及是否應政府之電召、陳氏謂渠家居流上、去年六月間出國、赴歐遊歷、今已七月於茲、故倦遊歸來、旣非政府中人所電召、亦無河項任務也、</p>
<h3 id="c90">主張未變更 <a href="#c90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>陳氏繼答記者之問、表示其以前所主張之對日絕交等意見、仍未變更、對國際間之形勢、謂各國之視我也、正如丐者之乞憐於人、且認我國早應全國一致動員、以顯示我國並不自弱、并不專事依賴他人、如此、則始能使國際間重視、否則如今日之所爲、直完全依賴國聯、而予國際間以輕視我國之地位、乞丐之哀音、路人無不輕視之也、且日本在國聯方面、早與英法各國交換意見、對英則以英國在遠東之印度爲言、對法則以法屬安南爲言、因之英法各爲其利害關係、自不願與日爲仇、我國之所求乞於人者、其結果亦只成幻夢耳、</p>
<h3 id="c91">不引起大戰 <a href="#c91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>陳氏并表示滿洲問題即或决裂、亦斷不能引起世界二次戰事、因今日美國决不敢言戰、除非英美兩國聯絡、一致對日、然英美間殊無合作可能、英美之何以不能聯成一氣、陳氏未言其理由、但英意蓋聞英美間有複雜的戰債問題在也、</p>
<h3 id="c92">外交策爲何 <a href="#c92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>陳氏又謂、各國均有其一定之外交政策、故其辦理外交也、只須依其已定之外交政策進行、故如英使監浦森之駐華也、一切事宜、均可依其本國之久交方計針、自由進行、有處理之全構、試問我國之外交方針爲何耶、</p>
<h3 id="c93">道德上制裁 <a href="#c93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>陳氏言及對外問題時、曾引證一八六七年之日本歷史作證、繼謂依頼國聯、終必失敗、國聯只能作道德上之制裁、單獨靠國聯、係屬無用、本人之意早宜對凱洛格非戰公約及華盛頓會議各國（即九國公約）發表宣言、促其召集會議、蓋主要目的、乃在使美國正式參加、而議决案方有事實上執行的力量、至中俄復交問題、陳氏認爲此不過恢復國交耳、應有更進一步之工作、此外陳氏並言及經濟問題之抵制日貨、謂如現下之經濟絕交、不足使日本商業受何等之損失、蓋日貨尙可經由印度化裝輸入中國也、最後陳表示渠不入京、因渠即使長外交、仍不能發揮其權威、使其主張實現、故入京又何用云云</p>

<p>并稱在平視察監獄情形昨據國民社巴黎電、世界名流所組織之非戰會、將組調查團來華、前往東北調查云云、孫夫人宋慶齡女士、且已去電歡迎、新聲社記者、昨特往中央研究院、面晤副院長楊杏佛氏、據詢内容、同時并與談在平視察監獄情形如下、</p>
<p>反帝國大同盟　據楊氏稱、該項組織、實名「反帝國主義大同盟」、孫夫人爲該同盟名譽會長之一、參加國家、歐美及中印等國咸有之、重要分了、係包括社會黨與工黨等、以站於左傾方面者居多、其中皆屬世界有名著作家及科學家、均極有地位而有權力者、惟其名現尙未能宣布、其目的在反對任何一國、以武力侵略其他國家、如日本此次之以暴力侵略我東北是也、尤其是反對帝國主義者聯合一綫、以壓迫弱小國家、是以當一二八淞滬戰爭之時、該同盟曾有極長宣言、痛斥日本之非、惟我國當時因未曾譯出、故未經披露、最近該同盟會曾舉行重要會議、討論『不侵略中國問題』、並因李頓調查團報告書、係出於帝國主義集團之手、頗多不忠實之處、遂决意自組調查團來華調查、另繕一報告書、以眞實情形、昭告於全世界人士、惟其來華日期、因尙未接其電告、故不深悉、、惟孫夫人等已準備屆時招待云云、</p>
<p>調查監獄經過　本人此次在平調查監獄情形、尙係初次、結果計被調查者、一爲陸軍監獄、一爲軍分會反省所、一爲軍事執法看守所、法院監獄及公安局看守所等、均未及調查、此三監獄、被拘者有一百五十餘人、其中皆係青年學生居多、經分别與之談話、結果年齡四十左右者、衹前傳已死之共產黨韓麟符一人、此人曾於容共之時、担任中央工作、其餘咸在二十至三十左右、其犯罪緣由、半於分共之際、因共產嫌欵而被拘入、半係革命護濟會、因與其黨有關係、而被拘入者、其中有女子一人、年衹十八、亦同在押禁中、此外尙有情形特殊者一人、監獄房屋、因經濟關係、咸係工廠所改建、因陋就简、一室之内、容人十六、於衛生上極爲不合、較之模範監獄、眞有天壞之别、亟須加以改良也、至於此後調查、現尙未定、但將來尙須請專家加入、同往調查云云、</p>
<p>古物被阻原因　繼又謂、中央研究院運滬之一百二箱古物、原與故宮古物不同、中央研究院者、係龜甲陶片銅質之屬、係當年在鄭州土中掘出、其中殘缺者居多、僅又作歷史上一種研究之用、故宮古物南運、原爲避免危險、係北平人士、認爲該項古物、得繁榮北平之要件、一旦移去、必受影響、是以極端反對、將箱以後、汽車行脚夫之類、因恐地方人士之責備、皆不肯担任搬運、以致發生阻滯、至於出賣古物之傳言、係另有作用之一種宣傳、故最後平人之意、希望於危險時期過去、仍運平保存、現經易培基等向宋代院長請示、宋氏已復電、允於平靖時運回北平、想經此一電、必可免去阻滯、此本人所悉之槪况也云云、</p>

<p>丨洪懐德君來信丨</p>
<p>我每天讀貴報的讀者顧問，間接解决了我不少的疑難。但有時我也有不同情形的難題，我屢欲請問、又恐貴報以我意思幼稚而不答我。我今有生死關頭的難題，請先生指導一下。我今年二十歲，因爲家境窘迫，綴學已六年了！現在一家小百貨店裏當店員，月薪低微，只够個人化用。以前在小學讀書的時候，有一個小我三歲的女同學，和我要好，以後她家裏搬在江西住了幾年，因此兩下，都忘掉。㤷巧，在去年又搬在我店附近，我們久别從逢，一度交談，感情益深了。有時我抽空和她在郊野談心，愛情就漸縐濃厚。我倆的志意，年齡，貎像，都相當，可恨我倆家庭環境太不相當了！她是中產階級家庭的六小姐，我是前途茫茫的苦少年，除本人之外，絕無一　依靠，在舊式社會裏，誰不見「養女望高門」她父出决不會把門當户對的觀念丢開，將她嫁給找這様的苦少年的！在半年前，她已由她父母許給一個所謂少老闆，她死力反抗無效。她因此日見消瘦，我總是設法安慰她。我又招忌店主，我迫於環境不得不疏遠她了！她憤極自殺，意在表明她愛我的心跡，幸被她家人發覺，得　更生。我呢，清夜捫心自問，實在負她一片苦心了！我决不顧和她私奔，一來有觸法網，二來連累她父親的聲譽，想來思去，在倆唯一出路，只有自殺！先生經濟豐富，足爲我暗室明證，兩除死以外；還有什麽辦法沒有？</p>
<p>答：讀罷來信，不禁先替足下灑了一掬同情之淚。足下的問題乃是現代社會的一般青年的問題，本報對於讀者的「顧問」，沒有不竭誠盡智以告的，</p>
<p>至於同人等知識有限，見聞有所不及，則當公開研究，海内不乏明達先覺之士，亦必有以敎之。足下恐怕因「思想幼稚而不答」，那實在是誤會。這是在未答復來信之先應該向足下鄭重聲明的。我們對於男女關係有一個基本觀念，就是；凡於男女兩性的關係即愛情完全建築在「兩相情願」，「互相認識」的基礎之上的，我們皆對之表示極端的同情。但是所謂「兩相情願，互相認識」又必須有一個必要的條件：即兩方面必須是經過相當的互相考察的時間，在這個考察時間，一定要用兩方的理性與知識及經騐來分析兩方的性情，習慣，經濟生活的能力以及將來同居的計畫萬不可憑兩方一時的盲目的感情貿然行動：「自殺」固絕對不是辦法：「私奔」也非得計。爲什麽呢？㈠婚姻不自由是現在社會制度的必然現象，我們因爲婚姻不自由，正應積極地向這種使牠不自由的社會進攻，才是好漢，自殺便是對這種不自由的社會表示屈服，退讓，雖然美其名曰消極抵抗，實則一死了之，豈不爲識者所笑，縱然死了，出算不得一個雄鬼，所以我們根本反對自殺。㈡「私奔」在下述的幾個條件之下原來是可以的：（A）兩人都對於前途認識極澈底，看透了前途是有無窮的困難危險而誓與之奮鬭到底：）B）兩人對於社都會有相當的經歷，不致一出大門，便是天涯；（C）兩人　元澂·陶牧·黃伯度·　愼予·　際安·　　平·李子寛·姜及胡·租·兩方家族、計共百餘人、雙方主婚人致詞後、來賓公推許世英代表致詞、婚禮卽告成、新郎現肄業交通大學機械科、新娘爲南京匯文女子中學高材生、翟君世居蘇湖、與胡君爲三十餘年前患難交、當前清光緒季年、胡·翟·兩君合辦農墾於萬頃湖　、以兵法部勒農佃、以冀光復舊物、時蘇曼殊·劉光漢·執敎鞭於安徽公學、陳獨季創辦安徽白話報於科學圖書社、均時通聲息、翟君長公子毅夫、美國芝加哥大學政治學碩士、曾任南開大學敎授、金總縣長、現任江蘇建設廳視察、次公子晋夫、美國西北大學法學博士、現任職立法院　審夫晋夫之夫人曹美恩女士、亦美國偉丁堡大學敎育碩士、均蜚聲於社會云、</p>

<p>誌謝　昨承商務印書館惠贈英語週刋第十七期、兒童畫報第七期各一册、謝謝、</p>
<p>都有狠好的生活技能，對於謀職業一層有十分把握；「D」兩人走了之後，母家不會用法律力量來窮追，果然窮追，有什麽善法與之相抗！訴訟若眞具備這些條件私奔也未始不可。據我們看來恐怕未必。第一件你的愛人是個中產階級的小姐，你是一個窮措大，在這種社會舊勢力的重圍中，你想用這個手段衝破網羅，結果是馬上失敗。無已，只有一法；你和你的情人商量；請她第一步先堅决地拒絕彼方的婚約，第二步要求她的父母給她學費，出來讀書，趕緊準備一種獨立生活的技能，一方面你也到她讀書的地方找一個工作，旣然離開家庭，又預備有了生活技能，那還怕誰人來干涉呢？所以怕人干涉或受家庭干涉，根本都是因爲要依靠那種干涉她的勢力。而且你們在此時間，行動一定比較自由，兩人也可乘此機會平心靜氣互相觀察對方的一切，看着到底是不可以矢志不移。若是事過境遷，兩人的感情又各有懐抱，那便趁早收帆，各行其是，免得關係愈深，煩惱愈大；若果眞是彼此情好無閒，始終如一，那你們便在相當時期成就好事，也算功德圓滿。旁觀之言，聊貢一得，促下幸三思之。</p>

<p>嘗考神經衰弱構成之原因、或由於過度使用腦力、或由於不正當之性懲衝動、及無節制之縱懲、前者關係於學校敎育、後者關係於社會環境、而後者當尤重於前者、夫物質文明之開展、男女交際之變遷、潮流所趨、旣大異於往昔矣、青年脆弱心情、受其激　、任意追逐、不能自止、結果惟有日趨陷溺耳、須知慾念本無滿足之境、縱欲卽爲罪惡之媒、社會惡魔之誘惑、旣已層出而不窮、個人心旌之動搖、遂亦莫如其所屆、苦悶·抑鬰·悲觀·厭世·相繼而生、勢所必至、夫精研科學、努力勞作、服務社會、保　國家、是皆全國人民所厚望於今日之青年者、而青年固已如此矣、天下痛心之事、執有過於此者乎、</p>
<p>同人等、對於中等學校當局、施敎施謂、固切盼其能精密注意於學生身心、對於社會負有維持風化責任之領袖、固切盼其能謹愼持　、無再示後生以惡範、而於現在高中大學或畢業高中大學之青年、血氣將定、學識漸充、更不能不具萬分願望、以期其能由自省而達於自立、</p>

<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>我有一位久在政界的老朋友紫陽先生新從北平回來，相見握手道無慈以外，我略問現代政界情狀；他摸着小　子答道；「一部廿四史，將從何處說起？但說幾句慨括的話，我曾經　一副六字對聯，非但對仗腿工；而且，抵得一部新官塲現形記」。我間；「六字聯，怎麽様？」他說：「拍馬屁，過日脚；吹牛皮，出風頭。」</p>
<p>六字聯的對仗工巧，眞呌做：「文章本天成，妙手偶得之」；但說抵得一部新官塲現形記，這範圍未免太狹了啊！須知「拍馬屁過日脚，吹牛皮出風頭」，任何古今中外的種種社會，總脫不了這六字對聯的意味；所差異的，不過質量的濃厚和稀薄罷了！</p>
<p>馬屁的力量，可以涵蓋世間一切的一切而有餘；只爲時代之輪是向前不絕的推進；凡是，追隨不上的形形色色，都有落伍的日子。聖賢要落伍，經傳要落伍，科學藝術要落伍；惟有宜古，宜今，宜將來的馬屁專家，永遠沒有落伍的日子！俗語說的：「千穿萬穿，馬屁不穿；」這便是馬屁家不會落伍的鐵證啊。</p>
<p>吹牛皮的習慣，任何人都不能打破；尤其是文人、試看古往今來的著作家，誰不做些牛皮式的詩古文詞？尤其是商人，試看環球各國的行商居賣，誰不做些牛皮式的商業廣告？尤其是軍政界中的宣傳人員，誰的牛吹的足，便是誰的風頭出的健；他們的工作，除郤「吹牛皮出風頭」以外，好說一句「不作别用」了。</p>
<p>紫陽先生的六字對聯，確乎是古往今來由中至外　撲不破的話。</p>

<p>丨侵略者留心變壞丨</p>
<p>自由戀愛，本可打倒盲目婚姻。自由戀愛，本是男女正當結合的大路。但是我國的青年男女，年來開口自由戀愛，閉口婚姻自由，弄到後來，十分之九，都未到正式結合，早已别有所戀了。「自由戀愛」，竟成了男女苟合的代名詞。</p>
<p>雅片，碼啡，安眼藥片等等，在歐美各國，要來都是供醫藥用的，正不知有多少病人，叨了這些藥品的光。但是雅片到了我國，大家呑雲社霧的吸食，嗎啡等等，製造紅丸，白丸。安眠樂片，更成爲一種直接自殺的工具。</p>
<p>留學生們到外國去留學。讀政治學的，回國來專管撈錢鬧意見。讀軍事學的，回國來尃致力於内戰。這此留學生，在外國所學得的，難道也是這些學問麽？</p>
<p>社會主義在蘇俄，造成了四年完成五年計劃的驚人成績，國内秩序井然，各國敬畏。但是我記得國共未分家時，社會主義也曾風行一時，可是其結果，却弄得妻殺其夫，子殺其父，金融破產，百業停滯，形成了公妻共產的局面，破壞得不知所云。就以最近的江西共匪而論，其成績也無非是殺人放火而已。</p>
<p>日本人說：「不拘甚麽事。在别國很好的，一到了中國，便甚麽都變壞了。」這句話，似乎很帶些侮辱性。但是我們仔細一想，這話倒也有三分道理。上面所說的幾個例子，不過是隨手拈來的，已很夠證明日本人所說的話了。</p>
<p>「橘踰淮而變枳」，不拘甚麽事，到了中國，都會變壞的，所以有人來侵略中國，我們儘讓伊來侵略。伊們若到中國土地上幹甚麽事，保險也一敗墮地·不得好结果。</p>

<p>各行都在競爭，玻璃窗中陳列得五花八門，都想吸引些顧客；而各家的門口，平均都站着一個討飯的。尤其是夜晚，街　前蹲伏着，道路上呌走着，丨是難民是乞丐？竟能賽勝了六千多號的街車及數不清的飽飯者。這是一月二十五以前的印象。</p>

<p>大家看　狗咬人的事吧：當牠咬的時侯，牠是張牙舞爪，不顧性命將向前撲去！牠不管被咬的是徒手，是拿着棍棒，甚至向牠瞄準了刀槍！然百人，你說他可這様呆麽？他平時「二尺半」丨武裝一穿，你看有多神氣！可是，一　人家說聲打來，他却跑得比狗快得多了！因爲他比狗聰明，他如道：忍辱負重！不吃眼前虧·這是一。</p>
<p>狗咬人咬得敗了時候，只有「嘷」的一聲，尾巴一夾，一溜烟的跑了，此外甚麽動作也沒有，至於人，那可不然；敵人還不曾打來，一拉架子，他就沒命的跑！他滿心：「貪生怕死，苟且偷安」！却滿口嚷着：「你們都要鎭靜，讓我慢慢呌對付去」！請問：狗有這様聰明嗎？這是二。</p>
<p>狗被打了，就記着仇恨：第逢遇着他的敵人，總是張牙舞爪的！呌牠的敵人知道：我有深仇未報！而人，可謂不在乎：那怕破我門，入我室，打得我斑斑塊塊，紅紅紫紫，一轉臉，却又能「杯酒言歡』！這種寛宏大量，狗那能比得上！這是三，</p>

<p>有一個會說中國話的敵人，大聲嚷着說：喂，現在皇上瞧你們怪可憐的，呌咱們拿了許多大洋錢來賞你們·········你們怎麽不懂規矩喲？快點兒跪下喲·········全跪下了麽？·········好，這麽跪着，别動，讓咱們先給你們照個相給皇上瞧，知道你們全領了賞啦·········跪好，别動，照完了相就領賞·········」</p>
<p>三千多的男男，女女，老老，少少的人們挺着腰，直着脖子跪在地上，呆呆的瞅敵人，不知道他要編些什麽鬼。</p>
<p>「這様不行喲，全得低下頭，不能抬起來·········要不然，照了相，皇上要說你們不恭敬，下次不賞你們啦·········」</p>
<p>三千多的男男，女女，老老，少少的人們眞聽話，一個個全把頭俯下來，眼看着地上，遠遠的望去，彷彿是黑壓壓的一羣頭藏在肢翼裏正在熟睡的鳥兒。他們的頭一低下、脖子便露在外面了；雪一團團的落在皮膚上面，頭只管搖動，又不敢用衣袖去遮着，只得咬緊了牙齒，眼皮往上翻着偷看那些敵人怎様給他們照相，心裏希望快點兒胡亂照一下不算啦。跪在第一排的人們，眼稍裏果然瞧到那些敵人忙着　好了三脚架，隨後在三脚架上裝好了一個黑黝黝，亮晶晶的圓筒，又見日本兵把一條布帶往裏塞；圍着他們一個大圈兒至少也有十七八架。他們全透着奇，忖着：這個圓筒就是照相機麽？這些人們全照在那條布帶兒上面麽？今天眞交運：有賞錢，又能開開眼兒！照相·········</p>
<p>在中間幾排的人們，因爲脖子裏只管给　淋着，化了水全凍成冰塊，怪難受的，便往外面偷看了一眼，不知道幾個敵人全蹲在地上幹什麽，不在注意他們；就微微的抬起頭來，想使脖子活動一下。（六）</p>

<p>郵票小史　　在世界上使用約郵票，種類很多。而且層出不窮，可算得極盡五花八門之妙。考它約歷史，他有九十八年了。那第一次郵票發明約時代，是在一八三四年。郵發明約，是一個英國人，名字呌　　斯，却　　斯，GuuegGkulmers</p>
<p>英國政府在一八四○年，曾有一件　案：創製一種一辦士郵票，印刷在信封上面，並訓令人民使用　種郵票信封。可是因　使用不　，民衆一政反對，結果就採肜郵却爾是斯發明的黏貼郵票。</p>
<p>美國在一八四七年，才使用郵票：也是採用黏貼郵票的。這就是郵票的一叚小小的歷史　　世界上有多少方言　世界上的方言，包括各種土語在内，約有三千四百多種。那些方言，大中因着風土的　隔，和相沿的習慣，永遠地不易改變。這巨大的方言數目，自然大部分屬於未開化野　人的。在亞洲約有九百多種，歐洲約有六百多種，菲洲約有二百七十五種，和美洲一千六百多種。</p>
<p>痛楚的原因　我們的身上，無論那一部分，生了一個　，或者給刀割碎了，立刻就會覺得痛楚。但痛楚的過程怎様，我們又怎様會感覺呢？那就因着人們的背脊上，有一個神經的中樞；由這中樞上把細小的神經，像蛛綱般的滿佈在人身的各部。假使我們的某一部分，發生了反常狀態，那細神經立時報告中樞，我們就感到痛楚了。但神經的布列，有的部分比較稠密，或更接近着皮膚，那部的感覺，就特别敏銳些。反之，感覺就比較遲純了。倒如足跟的神經，並不接近皮膚表面，所以感覺上最是遲鈍。</p>
<p>我們割碎了一枚手指，手指上的血管和細神經同時斷折。那循瑕的血，旣不能由原管中輸回心房，就從斷口中湧出，便成爲流血。同時細神經又把遭遇的不安，報告腦部我們便感痛楚。因着割處皮膚碎裂，内部接觸了空氣中的氧氣，更使細神經發生播動，腦部就增了痛楚的感覺。所以简單些說，痛楚的原因，祇是神經不安而引起的一種感覺罷了。例加醫院中割症時，把那被割處的神經先行麻醉了，開割時病人就不會感受痛楚；又如牙醫生把腐齒的神經，用麻醉方法取去以後，雖然腐齒的現狀依然存在，那病人却永遠不會再發生痛楚。那就因爲神經已失了報告能力，腦部就像不聞外事的桃源中人，永居於麻木的，盛平之世，不會感覺痛楚哩！</p>
<p>我們怎様會饑餓　饑餓，滑稽說來，是「　殿作崇」，而進一步的見解，却認爲是胃部需要食物。但照生理學講，第二種說素，也是似是而非。因爲人類的血液，是循環着不斷的在生長，到了相當時機，製造新血液的材料，宣告了缺乏；這缺乏血料的報告，達到胃部，人們就感覺饑餓了。因爲人們的食物，到了胃部，由胃吸收了食的中的要素，和另一種汁液混合了，製造集新的血液。所以胃，不過是製造血液的一個工廠，可知人倔饑餓的緣因，也不是胃一部的事，却是全身需要新血材料而起的。我們可以用極简單的事實，來證明這話。一個餓極的人，祇須把製造血液的材料，注射到大腸裏面，雖不經過胃，那人的饑餓，也可和吃了</p>

<p>凡購呢絨衣料。（一）在研究其質料是否經着耐穿。（二）在要做何種衣服須配何種質料。如做夾袍子或駱駝絨袍。最好選取深褐色的花呢。或素色與夾色華特呢之類。配料究屬易與。選料爲外行所難能。假如要買花呢。務　質地柔軟。向天空照看漏空甚少者爲佳。華特呢務要雙面。以身骨厚重者爲上。並以手指搓揑之（用大指食指二只）如推動柔活者毛質居多。搓推不動而呆滯者其質多紗。大凡呢絨一門。質地結實爲佳。質地鬆硬爲劣。質結實耐穿而久不發毛。質鬆易起毛頭而不經穿。故毋論嗶嘰花呢。華達呢。直貢呢。其他一切諸般毛織品。俱以質地緊結者爲貴。内行看貨。亦先研究此着。素嗶嘰尙要看花紋之粗細。細密者較優。元直貢以貢紋清楚。顏色光純者爲上乘。麗華染色及有西文英地果字様者。保不退色。試以硝　水一滴、色老虎黃者、亦得不退、若變他種顏色。均要退色。然此限於直貢嗶嘰華特呢之染色一類。其夾色混合織成的花呢。則不在此例。因花呢多三四色毛線織成。故不能變色。如在夏季。欲做單長衫。最好做質堅而飄薄的花呢。或做西裝料的全毛羽紗呢。切不可做普通的絲光條子羽紗呢。因夏季的長衫。皆要洗燙。人造絲條子羽紗呢。不經幾時就要損壞。一經日光曝曬。反色絕快。故萬不可貪價廉而反受虧。如要便宜。寗可剪素色羽紗呢。至七八角一尺的素嗶嘰。大多數都是法國貨。穿不幾時。就要變色。亦不經穿。與華達呢相較。以一比三。不如購剪生毛或芝蔴色等嗶嘰較宜。如在冷天時候。則可買麥爾登或爛糊呢。價反便宜。而甚牢固。較諸下檔七八角一尺的熟毛嗶嘰。耐穿多矣。</p>

<h3 id="c237">蘇小小與白娘娘娘（二） <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>我們且把這兩個故事，錯綜地看一看，這是很好的對照。蘇小小所過的是唯美的享樂主義的生活，她是典型的摩登女子；她是東方的茶花女。白娘娘正與之相反，她是賢妻，完全爲她的丈夫犧牲她自已。但是蘇小小以她自己爲中心，把男性旋轉得天昏地暗；千百年後的文人還不斷地替她捧塲。白娘娘以「夫」爲「天」，跟着丈夫跑，丈夫當她是妖怪是蛇，用缽盂罩在她的頭上，用雷峯塔鎭在她的身上，使她不能出世。我們中國的禮敎網，自南宋以後，漸漸完密，何以對於蘇小小道様優容，對於白娘娘這様苛刻？這不是値得我們考量一翻嗎？原來農業社會的有閑享樂生活，爲貴族（王族，卿相，）地主階級所獨佔；貴族地主的門下，有幕僚清客這些清高的文人替他們帮閑，凑趣。蘇小小的生活，雖爲禮敎所不容，却正是有閑階級的享樂對象；孔老夫子尙且願意去見南子，王孫公子自然心甘意願爲蘇小小所顚倒的了。浦高的文人，至少都有八斗才，個個都是才子；有才子必有佳人，蘇小小正是千百個才子的最好對象，！哼「湖山此地曾埋玉」的才子，天天可以在湖堤上看見。所以蘇小小的生活蓶在士大夫禮敎之外，却在士大夫對象之中，可以留在那邊，替湖山生色的。　　至於白娘娘，她是許宣的家主婆；媳婦一進門，婆婆就不高興。婆婆談起她的媳婦總必搖頭嘆氣道：「自從我家那個狐狸精進門，我的兒子聽了床頭哄，什麽都變了様兒子！」於是東也是那個妖精不也，西也是那個妖精不好，迫得兒子虐待了媳婦，那才稱她老人家的心願。睹位同學，你莫以爲我們是生在二十世紀，受過敎育的。你若嫁在一個大家庭，進門那幾年，男家沒有什麽變故便好，若是風吹草動，公公丢了官，丈夫失了業，都　怪你是個尅星，天天詛咒你，使你不得安身的。要忠實做賢妻的女子，註定是「妖怪」，「蛇」的命運，那眞無可逃避的呀！上海四馬路有一家藥房的窗樞裏，坐了一位長衫馬褂的少年，他的身上糾纏了一條大蛇，蛇的頭正是一個美人；那正是「女人是蛇」的最好說明。禮敎先生說：若非我的母親是女人，我早殺盡一切女人！！！當然不殺蘇小小。</p>
<p>的娘娘並不怕許宣，但是許宣有法海禪師給他口缽盂，罩在頭上，使她不能縳動。這個缽盂是什麽，那便是經濟權。白娘娘壓在地底，法海禪師砌了塔基，便有許多人願做功德，造成一座巨大的雷峯塔。這巨大的雷峯塔，便是千百年來的傳統思想。「經濟權」和「傳統思想」，把一切女人都壓信了。</p>
<p>現在，雷峯塔是倒掉了，鑽出來的白娘娘，她頭上還罩着法海禪師的缽盂，她能轉動嗎？誰來替白娘娘敲破這個缽盂呢？諸位同學，請他細想一想！（完）</p>
<h3 id="c238">某一種人 <a href="#c238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— 李冰</p>
<p>在中國，某一種人似乎專是爲了歎氣而存，恰像另一種人專是爲享樂而生存一様。</p>
<p>當革命黨人趕跑了宣統小子，翦掉了「滿人」帶來的辮子，把龍旗換了五色旗的時候，某一種人的歎息曾此起彼應地熱鬧過一時。</p>
<p>時間過去了，人們漸都習慣於「光頭」生活，皇帝改了大總統，似乎也對他們沒有什麽壞處，照理應該安靜了，然而内戰起來了，捐稅加重了，生活更困難了，因此，爲「歎氣而生存」的人們，爲了這，爲了那，又長吁短嘆起來這聲音，和「天子」被趕跑時沒有二様。</p>
<p>到前年，「國難」又來了，首先是全國大水災，次之是東三省被日本佔去，次之是上海被搗毀了一隻角，政府束手無策，自然這又是爲「歎氣而生存」的人們伸長頸子歎氣的絕好幾會。於是一聲長，一聲短，一聲唉，一聲呵的互相呼應，那陰森森的絕望的聲音，也還是二十三年前的傳統的一套！</p>
<p>人感受到痛苦，對現實不滿的時候，應該有勇氣復仇，有力量改造，退一步講，也應該有辭嚴義正的批評與判斷，再退一步，苛刻的嘲諷和幽默的譏刺，至少也還是活人的行動。只有那陰森森的歎氣却表示了絕望仁幻滅！</p>
<p>一個切實地抓住了生命的人，是無暇爲自己歎氣的。無論怎様的困難，無論怎様的慘敗，無論怎様的被壓迫，他只有不斷的爭鬥，爲自己的生命盡責，歎氣是表示着對自己的生命都沒有把握的可憐的得爲，是鬼魂的呻吟，是幽靈的哀呌。</p>
<p>不過，有鬼魂的呻吟，有幽靈的哀呌，至少亦已說明了這年頭不是陽光照耀的「白晝」，而是黑暗的「死夜」，那末，我們讓這陰森森的呻吟和黑暗的死夜一起過去罷！</p>
<h3 id="c239">讀「詞的解放運動專號」後恭感 <a href="#c239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— 陽秋</p>
<p>月之五日下午，偶過「我的朋友」黎烈文兄處，又偶然看到他的案頭上擺的新時代（丨）月刋「詞的解放運動專號」。我想，詩的解放運動旣已使我們的（不是「我的朋友」）胡老博士適在我國享了十幾年盛名，則詞的解放運動當然也不怎様「替板」，何况這又是「專號」，自然更是「青年男女，不可不讀」，一讀之後，更有「意想不到之效力。」於是我便打定主意，向「我的朋友」黎烈文兄專要這本「專號」，帶回和「我的夫人××女士」共讀。「我的朋友」黎烈文兄畢竟慷慨，「專號」是一索即得，於是我欣欣然携回，焚三炬清香，泡兩碗龍井茶，肅然展開「專號」，一本正經，夫唱婦隨的讀起來。</p>
<p>畢竟，「解放了的詞」和「沒有解放的詞」是「大不相同」，正如像女人們解放了的小脚與未解放的三寸金蓮大不相同一様。我同「我的夫人××女士」一篇一篇地讀下去，便讀到了曾××先生的「絕妙好詞」，曾××先生者，即「詞的解放運動的首創者」也，首創者的「詞」，！！不，「解放了的詞」，畢竟尤其「大不相同」，「我的夫人××女士」讀得喜出了眼淚之後，硬要我「廣爲宣傳」，就是我也覺得這件功德是不可當頭錯過，於是洗手添香，特爲恭錄，你瞧，下面就是：</p>
<p>畫堂春</p>
<p>一年開始日初長，客來慰我凄凉。偶然消遣本無妨，打打麻將。都喝干杯中酒，國家事管他娘。樽前猶幸有紅妝，但不能狂。</p>

<p>東北正嚴寒，不比江南暖；僞國居然見太平，何似中原亂？「全會」亦曾開，救國成懸案；出席諸公盡得官，國難無人管。</p>
<p>一件功德已了，　們又繼續讀下去，居然，「天下事，無獨有偶」，我們又發現了「天才」邵某的「天才詩」。自然，這樁功德是更不可錯過，不待我的夫人要求，我便自動的再次洗手恭錄如下：</p>
<p>題劉海粟的「秋天落日」</p>
<p>一九三二年十二月十七日下午，走訪當代畫家劉海粟先生於松筠别墅，一見傾心，相談甚歎，劉先生極贊美余時，開以「天才」二字贊余，銘感者久之。顧年來淪落天涯，潦倒青衫，崇拜余者固多，了解余者實少。今遇海粟，始感知音已遇。蓋藝人之同情，自與平凡者大不同也。别後欣喜異常。翌農憶起海粟之「秋天落日」一畫，爰執筆題之。海粟讀之，以爲何如？</p>
<p>紅日在天空板着臉，</p>
<p>壓得樹枝搖了。</p>
<p>河水如呆立的棺。</p>
<p>紅日變得如雲的Ｍask，</p>
<p>山谷如黃昏的鳥，</p>
<p>無聲地拖着嘆息。</p>
<p>兩樁功德旣了，心安氣靜，怡然自得。我的夫人忽然失聲「呵呀」，我問「呵呀」則甚？她說：「你做了兩樁功德，却平白地害了排字工友，而且又糟塌了這様好的紙頭，你是暴殄了天物呀，這罪過可不小呀！」經她這様一說，我不禁駭得伸出舌頭，爰口號一首，以誌吾過。詩曰：</p>
<p>阿彌陀佛你在上，小子做事眞荒唐！人家時長日也長，自該消遣打麻將；人家樽前不紅妝，管他能狂不能狂？河水呆立如棺木，紅日變得如雲醬，海粟且贊他「天才」，誰敢說是「不很像」？「時代」新了你守舊，管他娘呢管他娘！抄錄妙句猶可恕，害了工友不應當；害了工友猶可恕，糟塌紙頭喪天良！阿彌陀佛你在上，下次决不再荒唐。</p>

<p>— 珍</p>
<p>據路透社電訊，已故的英國文學家高爾斯華綏，有將在倫敦WeslminsterAbbey舉行國葬之說，這雖則還是一個提議，然卽此已可見英國人對於文學家，是怎様一副眼光了。高氏的許多好友，脫出來，當然都是當代著名的文人，現在聯名要求當局准許這個請求，看上去，當局是不會拒絕的。</p>
<p>高氏在臨危候，還有一個遺囑，便是要將他的屍體火葬，他的夫人在他死後的第一天便接着项皇及后從聖得林罕宮發來的唁電，說皇后二人聽着他的死訊，不勝悲悼，特對高夫人表示十二分的同情。他倆深覺高爾斯華綏之死，是文壇上一個甚的大損失，英國人，無論在國内或國外，都要感覺悲痛。</p>
<p>首相麥克唐納爾也有一個唁電：「請讓我獻上我那至深的同情·他的「死」是世界文壇上一個永不能塡補的漏洞。」</p>
<p>高氏在病危的兩天以前，寫完他繼「侍女」「有花的曠野」而作的三部曲的最後一章，原稿約有十萬字，雖全是初稿，但知道高氏文筆的人，曉得高氏在下筆時候，是那麽精細，卽使是初稿，也沒有多大修改的。然而這些稿，只有他最知己的親友才能看見，據刋行他大部份著作的海尼門書店的一個職員說：「高爾斯華綏的初稿，和别的作家的修正稿，是一様的精美。」</p>
<p>至於高氏最近所得的諾貝爾文學獎金，數目有九千六百鎊，依高氏的志願，要全數交給筆會保管，倘若筆會停頓，便將牠改作皇家文學會基金。筆會是全世界文人的集合，高氏自已還是一個主席呢。</p>

<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>他儘注視着任夫人那一角。他覺得今晚上的佩珍特别美麗。這不單是衣裝入時，而是她的固有的姿態動人。她的體態輕盈，長身玉立，在艶麗之中，還帶有高雅的成分。他覺得她　　「你認識她？你去要求她和你跳一回吧。」</p>
<p>鶴子夫人的聲音聽得出來是帶有點醋意。</p>
<p>「瞎說！」</p>
<p>他翻轉頭來顧着她笑了。</p>
<p>他看見佩珍，還是給那個又高又胖的大漢擁抱着，走出來了。海泉此刻拚命地注意那個大漢是怎様的一個人物。他愈留心看，愈覺得那個巨人的面貎凡俗，并且臉色也非常的黑。搭在佩珍肩背上的五個指頭，似乎有廣東某蔗那様的粗笨。海泉再注意他的雙脚，那更不得了，雖然是給西裝褲筒包裹住了，但也可以想像得出它的笨重不靈活的様子，只有「象腿」兩個字可以形容它吧。他想，那個巨人的腿一定是一直筒地沒有股，膝，脛等部分的區别吧。　　「任夫人何以和這様的巨人交際呢？這位巨人不消說是中國第一級的人物，！！軍閥了，」</p>
<p>他想着，又微吁了口氣。</p>
<p>二十四</p>
<p>還沒有嚮十一點，他倆便回到家裏來了。</p>
<p>大槪晴暖了兩三天，氣候轉變了。當他倆從跳舞場走出來時，感着了意外的凛烈的朔風。</p>
<p>「定要下雪了。」</p>
<p>他剛踏入後門，像自語地這様說。但是她沒有回答他。他不知道她爲甚麽那様的不高興，從跳舞塲一出來，便那様默默地不開口。每次他向她問一句半句話，她也只是微哂着不回答。這却呌他有些不好應付了。當他上樓梯時，以爲她一定定跟着上來的。但是在下面的客廳裏，像來了二三個日本客人，和那個東洋佬坐在火爐前，談得滿高興。只有那個美麗的小姑娘，聽見他倆回來了，便飛着似的跑了出來。她看見海泉，和平時一様媚笑着行了一個鞠躬禮。</p>
<p>鶴子夫人看見有客來了，忙走各前頭客堂裏去了。她也不對他說一聲，等息就會上來看他。</p>

<h3 id="c242">怎様做人？ <a href="#c242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>怎様做人？</p>
<p>這似乎是一個不成問題的問題，（去年本刋編者「佛」先生早已言之詳矣）但是再來談談，也許是很有趣的。</p>
<p>人有各色各様，因之出有各色各様的做人的法規，很難於四方八面都說得周全，所以只就我們這種人來略事一談。</p>
<p>那麽我們現在是怎様做人的呢？好得很，謹遵聖人之道，不愧爲我們五千年古國的大好兒孫。情願窮得三餐沒有飯吃，但是不做綁票匪。情願一天沒有一個銅板買一根香烟，但是不在馬路上拾起一節烟屁股。情願給自己的老婆打得皮破血流，但是，不便公然和别人的婕太太勾勾搭搭。其一是有傷道德，其二是顏面攸關。至於愛國一道，我們更是認眞；爲了表示不買劣貨的决心，我們不打從那種店家門口經過，爲了决心不做亡國奴，我們對洋人不惜怒目而視。雖然這不免有損君子之風，但是到也無傷大雅。</p>
<p>然而仔細思量，似乎有點不對，其後對於處世之道，也就不免懐疑起來。當然非另找門徑不可。雖然做强盜綁票，固然大可不必，不過對於人格之「薄利多賣，血本犧牲，」一點，到也未始不可吧。於是我們得研究今後之做的人藝術了。</p>
<p>起初我們得做就一身比較醒目的西裝，練就一套「多謝，多謝」，「不敢，不敢」的官話。在達官貴人之前，我們得渾身是禮的恭而敬之，除了恭喜他的官運亨通之外，還要說他怎様的福國造民。在資本地主之前，除了不能問他借銀或說他爲富不仁之外，而且千萬不能顯出自己的窮酸。他們姨太太做二十高壽，就是當了包脚布也得送上花籃或是銀盾。他們明天由上海到崑山，也得設筳餞行。他們假使出洋，就昨代買船票。他們做文章講演，就得拍手讚揚。至於賀年拜節，必須親自上門，乃是起碼道理了。</p>
<p>以上是對於高於我們一等的大春物而言。至於對於經濟地位在我們之下的人們，當然要擺起一副神氣十足的格曲。吃飯必須要有用人立在背後，坐黃包車必須不講價錢，電車必須頭等，看戲必須上樓。</p>
<p>於是，這様，我們便一步一步的擠上高等社會中了。不但是看回力球買香檳票不成問題，就是在「安内」而後「攘外」的國難之秋，就在「長期抵抗」以至於「精神抵抗」的時候，我們不妨再發明一種「吃飯救國」當然是一鳴驚人。至於在居然賣國的生意塲中，我們又何嘗不可以藉口中國無可救藥的哲理而挿入一脚？</p>
<p>是以做人决非難事，只看如何切實做去而已。</p>

<p>— 范</p>
<p>自從安迭生發明了電燈以來，全世界人士受他光明的賜與。不過在剛發明電燈的時候，電流用得很多，而光線還是暗淡，經過不少電學家埋頭在試騐室裏的努力，方有今日的電燈如同白晝的成績。</p>
<p>在幾十年以前，我們的電燈，光線還是非常暗淡而帶黃色的。因爲那時的燈絲是以炭絲製造的，這炭絲成本很貴，而又不經用。到了後來，又發明了一種金屬，名爲鎢的，作爲燈絲，則比較以前的炭絲，又省電，又明亮，又耐用。近來市上通用的長燈泡，即是鎢絲做的。不過長燈泡，也有一種短處：因爲鎢絲的特性，經了長期間的燃燒，能分泌出一種氣體，這種氣體粘附在電燈泡上，即是一種黃色的東西，這種黃色的東西，呈則可以减去光力，二則又有損美觀，故非常可厭。又這種燈泡燃燒了長久，燈泡的玻璃能傳熱得放不上手，這也是缺點之一。</p>
<p>我們知道，如要燈絲發亮，非有高熱度的熱不可，故燈泡内是十二分的焦灼的，但我們却不希望在泡外也發生高熱。於是又有一位發明家，他以一種淡氣裝在燈泡内，發生了顯著的功效：㈠燃燒久了，燈泡不會發生黃色的東西·㈡不會傳熱。㈢比鎢絲燈省電。㈣比鎢絲燈耐用。旣有了這様四大優點，但也有一個缺點，即是價格比鎢絲燈昂貴。可是比較起來，還是昂貴的値得。這燈本名淡氣燈，但市上也有呌他爲哈夫燈的，因爲哈夫（Ｈaif）解釋一半，蓋即可以省電一半的意思。</p>

<p>天公做美，廢曆年頭連日晴明，各影戲院和平戲館，無不每日上下客滿，遊藝塲更擁擠不堪，，眞可謂救國不忘娱樂，我想各游藝塲和各戲院老板，去年「一二八」所受損失，今年一次就可以賺轉了。</p>
<p>㈡</p>
<p>我們人的守舊性，爲任何國人所不及，即如政府早經改用國曆，而民間終是陽奉陰違，對於廢曆終未能堅心革除，這様極简便極易行的事，猶且如此，無怪一切皆落人後也，一嘆！</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>族居在外的人們，雖然有各種娱樂</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>塲所可以消磨業餘的光陰，談得來的朋友作遊玩的伴侶。但是，在一種時期，心頭總覺得有一種說不出的「煩悶」。先生！我便是其中的一個。</p>
<p>在我離開家鄕到上海來，不過兩個多月，每天的生活，憑良心說不能不算滿意，有增進智識的機會，有接觸社會的可能；對於所服務的事業，也感得到興趣。並且每星期有一天休息，得作其他的正當娱樂，以調劑生活的枯燥。在理，這種環境，正爲一般人求之而不得的，可以一無以求了吧？不過，人的心是不會滿足的，我在這種環境裏，却憧憬起所謂「族人的煩悶」來。！想找一個異性朋友來滿足我的欲望。</p>
<p>但，我得鄭重的聲明：所謂「欲望」，並不是鄙恥賤醜的「肉慾」，而在萬惡的上海要滿足個人的「肉慾」也並不是艱難的事，我所要解决的，只是說不出的「煩悶」而　。</p>
<p>我是一個已婚的男子，並且與我的妻子非常要好，因爲滬上的和活程度高並且她有她的環境使我不能毅然决然的將她携到上海來：於是我想找一個我理想中的異性朋友了。但是我又不敢，我怕跌入情羅愛網，使我翻不起身來；我恐我理想中的異性朋友受到社會的非難，而有進退維谷之勢。因爲我曉得男女青年時代的火熖是旺盛的，一接觸就可以燃燒在一塊；同時我曉得現社會是在新舊過渡，新的趨勢與舊的道德正在搏戰，女的與男的交了朋友很容易引起社會誤會，或竟成了時代的犧牲品。但我又無法解除我的「煩悶」。矛盾的心理在我胸中顚來倒去已非一日了，總無法得到解决。先生！請你指敎吧！謝謝你。　　狄吉，二十二，二，五。</p>
<p>編者按：讀了狄君的來信，我們深信狄君目下心目中的「欲望」誠然是「並不是鄙恥賤醜的肉慾」，而只是要解决說不出的煩悶」。但是天下事豈「有說「不出」的呢？我們敢武斷，這種「煩悶」，當然與「性」多少發生關係。否則在已經有了「談得來的朋友，作遊玩的伴侶」之後，又何必一定要找「一個異性朋友，來滿足我的欲望」呢？我們以爲這種「慾」的要求，是很自然的，大家不必諱言，像狄君那様藏頭露尾，說怎麽「說不出的煩悶」等話。照生理學說來丨一個成处人每天所用的營養料，變成兩種力量，一種是「動力」，一種是「潛力」。「動力」就是我們每天作事時費去的精力；「潛力」則潛藏於我們四肢百官之内，準備繁殖的。所以無論男女，達到相當年齡之後，這種「潛力」就作怪起來，需要一個異性做對手，來盡他們天賦的繁殖義務。不過在沒有對手的時候，這種「潛力」無用武之地，就變成了狄君所謂的「說不出的煩悶」罷了。</p>
<p>所以在「性慾」沒有解决的時候，與異性友人相交過密，的確難免要把「愛」「情」「慾」混爲一談。至於走入這種歧路後的差　與危險，狄君來信，說行明白無遺，我們似可不必饒舌。我們主張狄君趕快在經濟方面奮鬥，打破環境：把他的愛妻携到上海來同居。那時你再去交幾個異性朋友，我們倒可以贊成現下却勸你不可嘗試，這也是曲突徙薪的辦法呢！</p>

<p>— 汪仲賢</p>
<p>㈦眼睛裏吹了砂子進去</p>
<p>住在大菜間裏的，有若華，幼中和黛秋小姐，他們這一齣叔嫂戀愛的把戲，當然瞞不過黛秋。黛秋看見了，心裏說不出的難過。若華是她的娘，奈保不得，她只把幼中恨如切骨。</p>
<p>從前，黛秋和幼中的感情最好。她曾經對他說：『我爲什麽要呌你叔叔？這是多麽疏遠的稱呼呵！我若呌你阿哥，豈不是更親熱嗎？』</p>
<p>幼中對好說：『在無人聽見的時候，你儘管呌我阿哥，我只有二十三歲，我也秘願意呌你妹子呵』。</p>
<p>幼中時時的買了東西送給她，她也時常瞞了娘要幼中買東西，他們倆個常常躱在一間房裏說話，說些什麽，誰也不知道。</p>
<p>自從發現了幼中和她的娘有過苟且行爲以後，她便賭氣不要吃飯。娘問她爲什麽不吃，她推說暈船頭痛；幼中問她，她把嘴唇一直披到下頦。幼中避了若華的耳目，仍像平常一様，過去握她的手，想與她談話。她使勁一洒，將他的手洒開了，瞼掉到窗口去望着洶湧不定的海水。</p>
<p>『你什麽事情同我生氣？』幼中婉轉地問。</p>
<p>黛秋給他一百個不睬，幼中釘着問一個不休。她用手掌向下一劃，表示與他劃地絕交。他還是纏擾不休。她便堅决的答道：</p>
<p>『你是個骯髒人，從今以後，不要再同我說話！我當你已經死了，你了當我死了吧！』</p>
<p>這兩句比醋溜青梅還要酸的話，幼中聽了，心裏自像吃了螢火蟲一般明亮。但是，她僅僅是一個十五歲的女孩子，何以會有這麽大的嫉妒心？何以竟會領略男女之私？並且還有獨佔一個美男子的雄心？大槪是世界的進步太速了，女性的發育也特别增速，近以未成年的女孩子也懂得拈酸。</p>
<p>再說一句天地良心的話，幼中的確做夢也不曾想到姪女兒黛秋會與他發生戀愛。他們初見面的時候，她才十二歲，也可以說他是看她長大的。在這三年之中，他確是委愛她！！他樓抱過她的楊柳般的腰，他吻過她的蘋果般的頰！丨然而這些决不是變愛之愛的表現。聰明伶俐而又長得眉清目秀的小孩子，人人見了都歡喜的出鬍子的老伯伯，摟抱一個十歲左右的小姑娘，秃光了頂的老好婆，吻一個剛出門牙的小孩子，誰也不會轉歪　頭，連想到性的問題上去，幼中之愛黛秋，也是如此。</p>

<p>(Geneva) The Committee of Nineteen held another meeting this morning and resolutely decided to adopt the ten principles of Chapter Nine of the Lytton Report as the basis for recommendations. The recommendations will clearly condemn the illegality of "Manchukuo," declare that it will not establish any political relations with "Manchukuo," and will notify the United States and Russia to request their unified action. The recommendations can then be drafted by the nine-member drafting committee based on the above principles. (Central News Agency telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, the Chinese delegation protested to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Drummond, regarding his recent collusion with the Japanese representative, Matsuoka. (Central News Agency telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) This morning, the Committee of Nineteen met for two hours and decided to entrust the work of drafting various recommendations in accordance with the discussions at today's meeting to the Nine-Member Subcommittee. This morning's meeting identified three important principles as follows: 1) Unanimous agreement on the non-recognition of "Manchukuo"; 2) The meeting advocated that Chiang Kai-shek's recommendations be sent to neighboring countries and signatories to the Nine-Power Treaty to seek their cooperation; 3) The meeting advocated the establishment of a subcommittee to continue to represent the League of Nations in contacting the Far East situation. The Committee of Nineteen has instructed the Nine-Member Subcommittee to meet tomorrow and prepare a draft recommendation based on the views expressed at this morning's meeting and report it to the Committee of Nineteen. The first speaker at this morning's meeting was British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Eden, who advocated putting forward a resolution declaring that "Manchukuo" should not be recognized because "Manchukuo" does not have the qualifications to be recognized. He also said that the great powers must be bound by honor and must not act in a manner contrary to the spirit of this recommendation, otherwise this resolution would be ineffective. Eden also said that the members of the meeting had the same opinion on the policy to be adopted, and the difficulty lay in expressing it in appropriate words. The French representative, Massigli, agreed with this view, saying that the members of the meeting should also decide not to cooperate with "Manchukuo." The Czech representative, Piniš, enthusiastically supported the British representative, Eden's, remarks and suggested seeking US and Russian cooperation to support the League of Nations' recommendations and the plan for non-recognition of "Manchukuo," saying that the League of Nations' recommendations should be notified to neighboring countries (referring to Soviet Russia) and signatories to the Nine-Power Treaty (referring to the United States) in order to obtain their consent and cooperation. The members of the meeting heard this suggestion with great approval, so this suggestion will be included in the draft report. The Swedish representative, Undén, stated that after the adoption of the recommendations, there should be a way to prevent future developments, so he suggested organizing a committee to monitor the implementation of the recommendations. The members of the meeting did not oppose this suggestion, but felt that there were many difficulties in this move, so it was decided to leave this plan for future discussion. Today, the opinions of the executive committee members were completely unanimous, which was unexpected. All those who enthusiastically supported the League of Nations Covenant also expressed deep appreciation for the attitude of the British and French representatives. (Reuters telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Meeting Communiqué: The Committee of Nineteen issued a brief communiqué as follows: "The Committee of Nineteen met this morning, chaired by the Norwegian representative, Lange. The Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Drummond, reported to the committee on the fulfillment of his mission, as he had been entrusted to inform the Japanese delegation of the Committee of Nineteen's views on Japan's final recommendations and the procedures adopted by the committee. Drummond said that he had informed the Chinese delegation on January 20 that the committee was continuing to consider revising the resolution and explanatory memorandum in order to meet the wishes of the Japanese government, and said that there was reason to believe that the Japanese delegation was preparing to submit other recommendations. The Committee of Nineteen subsequently concluded that the report submitted by the Secretary-General of the League of Nations had not changed the original situation in any way, and therefore decided to continue discussing the principles to be included in the report, so that in the event of the final failure of the conciliation procedure, the report could be submitted to the General Assembly in accordance with Article 15, paragraph 4 of the Covenant. This level was then ordered by the Committee of Nineteen to prepare the final part of the drafting committee's report, pending a decision. The drafting committee is scheduled to meet tomorrow morning." (Havas telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) At today's meeting of the Committee of Nineteen, there was also a brief discussion on whether Article 16 of the Covenant (the current system of sanctions) would be automatically invoked if one of the parties refused to accept the recommendation, but most agreed with the explanation given by Secretary-General Drummond on Saturday that the articles of the Covenant were independent of each other and must be interpreted separately, as most representatives considered this explanation to be correct and worthy of following, but also agreed that the League of Nations' actions after a party's rejection of the recommendation should not be predetermined. The Spanish representative, Madariaga, stated that the member states should not make plans to cross the bridge before they reach it. Sauter proposed that the establishment of a committee to supervise the implementation of the recommendation should be included in the recommendation. The German representative, von Keller, opposed this move, declaring that since Article 15, paragraph 4 of the Covenant did not provide for such a committee, we should act within the scope of the provisions. At that time, many people in the meeting agreed with this view, and Sauter's proposal was rejected. In addition, it was practically decided that the important recommendations to the League of Nations General Assembly and to China and Japan should be included in a chapter of the committee's report. After a long discussion, it was decided to ask the United States and Russia to morally and actively support the recommendations passed by the League of Nations General Assembly, but the committee's report did not explicitly mention the names of the United States and Russia, but collectively referred to them as "third parties," and it was decided that the committee could not immediately proceed with attempts to obtain US and Russian cooperation until the League of Nations General Assembly had passed it. British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Eden and German representative von Keller also advised the drafting committee to draft recommendations that should be prudent and moderate, and strive to conform to the intentions already expressed by Soviet Russia and the United States. (National News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, the French representative, Massigli, clearly indicated when discussing the principle of non-recognition that the meaning of this statement was that member states of the League of Nations could not cooperate with Manchukuo in any way, and solemnly stated that after adopting this policy, the meaning was that member states could not give financial assistance to Manchukuo. After the French representative made this unusually clear explanation, the representatives of the other fifteen countries all expressed sympathy in silence, without a single speech.</p>
<p>According to reports, although Japan has resolutely opposed this move by the League of Nations and has repeatedly threatened to withdraw from the League of Nations, the countries have not been moved by Japan's threats in order to maintain the status of the League of Nations. This morning, with the exception of Mexico, Panama, and Belgium, which were absent, none of the representatives present made any dissenting remarks. At the same time, the committee also resolved to accept the ten recommendations in the Lytton Report as the basis for the committee's recommendations to the League of Nations General Assembly. According to today's meeting, the former Spanish representative, Madariaga, also attended with the current representative, Solote, which aroused a lot of discussion from the outside world, because it was previously reported that Madariaga had exceeded the scope of his instructions at the meeting in November last year and made remarks that were too anti-Japanese, which was displeasing to the government, so he retired to make way for the worthy.

<h3 id="e3">Special Committee Weakens Draft Resolution; Our Delegation Declares Opposition <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) In a communiqué issued by the Secretariat of the League of Nations, there is a section stating that "the Committee of Nineteen ordered the Secretary-General to notify the Japanese delegation that the Committee believed that the only basis for obtaining a favorable conclusion was for the Japanese government to accept the motion of December 16 of last year and make two amendments, namely, not to invite non-League of Nations member states to participate in the Conciliation Committee, and to grant the parties the right to make reservations when the Chairman represents the Committee of Nineteen in presenting the Explanatory Memorandum." Having read this, the Chinese delegation was extremely surprised, believing that if the Committee of Nineteen wished to continue negotiations in accordance with Article 15, paragraph 3 of the Covenant, the parties should stand on an equal footing and accept consultations, and that the amendments proposed by the Committee of Nineteen were of a nature that would further reduce the strength of the draft resolution and Explanatory Memorandum of December 16 of last year, which was obviously unacceptable to the Chinese delegation. The Chinese delegation had already stated its attitude towards this document in a memorandum on December 16 of last year and in a declaration on January 20 of this year, and it was even more necessary to solicit the opinions of the Chinese delegation before the Committee of Nineteen proposed amendments. Now that the Chinese delegation has not been able to obtain an equal opportunity to explain its views, it would be unfair if the world were to blame it for disrupting this shifting and unagreed conciliation procedure if this amendment were accepted by Japan and rejected by China. The Chinese delegation frankly declared that it considered two points to be the most important among the points that had been pointed out: 1) The non-recognition of "Manchukuo" should be clearly stipulated in the final solution and should be recognized by both parties; 2) The United States and Russia should be invited to participate in the conciliation.

<p>Ambassador Lampson Changes His Plans to Depart for Beiping Today</p>
<p>Made Important Contributions to the British Government</p>
<p>(Nanjing) British Ambassador Lampson will depart for Beiping on the 7th. On the 6th, Lampson visited Foreign Minister Luo again to discuss Sino-Japanese issues and Sino-British relations in detail. It is reported that Lampson sent a telegram to the British government on the 5th, reporting in detail on our country's attitude towards the League of Nations and the policy that Britain should adopt. The content was very important, making powerful contributions and suggestions. It is reported that Britain's foreign policy towards the Far East has changed significantly due to Lampson's suggestions. The British representative was the first to oppose Matsuoka's new proposal to the League of Nations a few days ago, which led to the failure of Matsuoka's proposal.

<h3 id="e5">British Newspaper Comments that League of Nations Mediation is Clearly Hopeless <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Saying that the British government has always supported the Covenant</p>
<p>Washing Away Suspicions of Simon Favoring Japan and Suppressing China</p>
<p>(London) The Times today published an important editorial entitled "Japan and the League of Nations," saying that there is now no doubt that continuing attempts to find a basis for reconciliation and compromise between China and Japan have failed, and that Simon and Eden's encouragement of the Japanese representative to continue to make efforts in this matter can be said to be timely. The scope of the conversations between the British and Japanese representatives in Geneva, as reported in Japanese newspapers, is obviously mostly inaccurate and misunderstands Simon's intentions. Simon only offered advice, which has proven to be not entirely unacceptable. Judging from the phenomenon, Japan will not make any concessions on the important issues it has repeatedly stated, and the method of mediation seems hopeless at present. It is important to know that Simon's intervention was not malicious or inappropriate. There were strange whispers in the Geneva gallery criticizing Simon, and the atmosphere was filled with slander, saying that there was a conspiracy behind British policy. There is no room for such remarks to exist. The most inaccurate thing is the suspicion that has arisen among the general public, especially among the representatives of the small countries, that Britain will not support the League of Nations Covenant in the final plan. The Times continued by saying that there are many dangerous elements in Europe today, and the best guarantee to avoid the outbreak of war is practical arms reduction compromises and a consolidated League of Nations. Britain will never want to weaken the prestige of the League of Nations. Those who can see the situation in Europe clearly are now no match for Britain. China has complained about the League of Nations' handling of the Sino-Japanese dispute with unwarranted delays, which is not surprising, but this case has special difficulties, and delays are inevitable. The League of Nations is not a supreme state and has done its best within the limits of what it can do under the circumstances. The League of Nations has never had the power (even if it takes it for granted) to force the autocratic Japan. Now, the League of Nations General Assembly can only prepare a report on the dispute and put forward a resolution. According to the phenomena shown by Japan, it will eventually be forced by the environment to find a solution in accordance with the methods described in the Lytton Report. The most important thing at present (Europe is more concerned than the Far East) is that the principles of the League of Nations must not be undermined in the League of Nations' report. The Times concluded by saying that it does not want to expel Japan from the League of Nations, but there is no reason to say that the report should force Japan to withdraw from the League of Nations. However, in the dangerous European atmosphere, the League of Nations Covenant must be upheld in order to preserve this peace mechanism. (Reuters telegram, 6th)</p>

<p>Insist on Opposing and Denying the Puppet State</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the League of Nations' new compromise proposal, Representative Matsuoka's request for instructions telegram arrived at the Japanese Foreign Ministry last night. Foreign Minister Uchida convened a ministry meeting this morning to discuss countermeasures. It is reported that Foreign Minister Uchida requested an extraordinary cabinet meeting on the case to decide on the content of the instruction telegram. (China United Press telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At 4:28 p.m. today, Japanese Foreign Minister Uchida entered the Imperial Palace to meet with the Emperor to report on the recent situation at the League of Nations, the content of the new compromise proposal put forward by Matsuoka, and the outline of the instruction telegram drafted by the emergency cabinet meeting, and requested the Emperor's approval. He left the Imperial Palace at 5 p.m. and immediately telegraphed Representative Matsuoka with the following main points: 1) The Imperial Government has not abandoned the efforts for a third conciliation, so it agrees to use the new method as the basis for the conciliation procedure; 2) It requests amendments to the following points of the method: (A) In the terms of the conciliation committee's mission, there is "to take the Lytton Report as the basis and, in light of subsequent events, to reach a reconciled solution," which is not an unconditional adoption of the Lytton Report. The so-called "subsequent events" should be clarified to be consistent with the Imperial Government's recognition of "Manchukuo"; (B) Regarding the sentence on the sovereignty of "Manchukuo" in the last item of the Chairman's Declaration, if it is in the form of a quotation from the Lytton Report, then there is the original sentence in the Explanatory Memorandum of the Resolution of December last year, which should be replaced by the sentence in Chapter Nine of the Report. The Imperial Representative should declare opposition to the Chairman's Declaration; 3) If the above-mentioned amendments are not adopted by the Committee of Nineteen and the efforts for conciliation fail, it is not Japan's responsibility. (Electric News Agency telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After being approved by the Emperor, the Japanese government's instructions were sent to the Japanese delegation in Geneva this afternoon, indicating that the Japanese government was not completely satisfied with the recent proposal drafted by the Japanese delegation, but did not oppose it in principle.

<p>Deliberately Making Things Difficult in the Name of Inspecting Passports</p>
<p>The American Captain Had No Choice But to Endure Humiliation and Apologize</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Yesterday, the American ship President Harrison arrived at the Yokohama Pier. Because the Japanese police inspected passports, there was a disagreement with the purser. The Japanese police then displayed the authority of the Yamato spirit. In anger, they recalled the Japanese police and left only three patrol officers on the ship to monitor. The captain of the ship visited the governor of Kanagawa Prefecture, Yokusama Sukeshige, to explain what happened because passengers could not disembark without their passports being inspected, and asked for understanding. However, Governor Yokusama showed unexpected stubbornness, saying that the governor could not interfere with the police department unless the American captain submitted a formal letter of apology to the police station, and there was no other way. When the passengers of the ship heard the news, they became furious and scolded the Japanese police for their unreasonable interference. Afterwards, the captain had no choice but to seek the help of the American consul and endure the humiliation of submitting a formal letter of apology to end the matter because he was in a stubborn sphere of influence. Since the occurrence of this incident, the general impression here has been bad, saying that such a demonstration by the Japanese police is enough to affect Japanese-American relations.

<h3 id="e8">Three Paths for Japan to Choose Freely <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The situation in Geneva is now particularly complicated. The impact of yesterday's meeting of the Committee of Nineteen is to allow Japan to choose one of three ways to go: 1) Accept the draft resolution and explanatory memorandum, but with the reservations that have already been expressed regarding the explanatory memorandum; 2) Allow the Committee of Nineteen to proceed with the work of preparing its report based on the reasons for the failure of conciliation, and place the obligation for subsequent actions on the League of Nations; 3) Break with the League of Nations on the grounds that its proposed amendments have been rejected. Of the above three points, it is generally believed in Geneva that Japan is likely to adopt the last one, because Japan has recently expressed its willingness not to close the path of conciliation. The second method only prolongs the dispute, and the first method, judging from the current situation, is also enough to lead to a more chaotic situation, because the Chinese delegation will be in a dilemma. If Japan accepts this final recommendation of the Committee of Nineteen, then what China has requested, such as the participation of non-member states in the negotiations, will be completely overturned, and the Chinese representative will inevitably have to protest. It is reported that Japanese Representative Matsuoka has advised his government to accept the League of Nations' final contribution. (Reuters telegram, 5th)</p>

<p>Fearing that it Will Fall into Diplomatic Isolation</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Local newspapers report that the Committee of Nineteen of the League of Nations will reconvene at 10:30 this morning to review the draft recommendation. If the Japanese government's instruction telegram has not arrived, it will not be mentioned. Most representatives of the countries regard Matsuoka's proposal as a consistent delaying tactic and not worth mentioning. The main question at present is whether Japan has the courage to withdraw from the League of Nations. The atmosphere in the small countries still hopes that Japan will withdraw from the League of Nations in order to maintain the authority of world justice. (China United Press telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At the meeting of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee of the Lower House of the Japanese Diet, Matsumoto questioned Foreign Minister Uchida yesterday whether Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations was propaganda. Foreign Minister Uchida requested a closed-door meeting. The Diet should request a closed-door meeting at 2:40 p.m. today. Uchida reported on the seat for about ten minutes. According to Uchida's report, the main point was that the Japanese government's principle was not to withdraw from the League of Nations, so it sent Matsuoka to Geneva to participate in the discussion of Article 15 with reservations. Although the League of Nations wanted to invoke paragraph 4 to make a recommendation, the government ordered the representative to do its utmost to prevent it, which was nothing more than this. If all efforts are ineffective, if the content of the recommendation is not too serious, then the representative will only be ordered to return to the country, allowing it to develop naturally. The recommendation is too critical of Japan and leaves no room for maneuver. In order to save face and maintain the credibility of the intimidation propaganda, it will have to withdraw from the League of Nations. Therefore, the Japanese Foreign Ministry's policy towards the League of Nations is "not to withdraw" in principle, and "withdrawal" is a last resort. (China United Press telegram, 6th)</p>

<p>The Opinion of the Japanese Naval Authorities</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the opinion of the Japanese naval authorities, Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations does not necessarily mean that Japan will also withdraw from the Disarmament Conference. There are two reasons for this: one is that the Disarmament Conference is not entirely organized by League of Nations member states, and non-member states also participate; and two is that the nature of the Japanese Navy's recent proposal has not yet been explained to the Disarmament Conference. If Japan withdraws from the Disarmament Conference at this time, the world will accuse Japan of not being sincere about disarmament. (Reuters telegram, 6th)</p>

<p>Contacting Diplomats and Military Figures</p>
<p>Coping with International Economic Blockade</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese financial circles are now deeply aware of the seriousness of the development of the situation in Geneva and are preparing to deal with it. Leaders from Tokyo's financial, industrial, and commercial circles have all agreed to work closely with diplomats and military figures in order to put forward possible constructive suggestions to deal with any situation in Geneva arising from the Sino-Japanese dispute. Although all financial leaders do not believe that Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations will have a serious impact on Japan's economic position, they are quite concerned that international relations may be disrupted as a result. Some advocate that the financial circles express their opinions on the current situation in the name of an organization, but most people believe that the current situation in Geneva is very complicated, and it is better to remain silent at this time and not take this action. Baron Go, chairman of the Japanese Economic Federation, expressed his opinion that, from a practical point of view, an economic blockade of Japan is inconceivable. Kodama, president of the Yokohama Specie Bank, said to guests that no matter what recommendations the League of Nations General Assembly may make in the future, the Japanese only need to answer "I know" and do not need to take any concrete action. Common sense dictates that an economic blockade is not a problem, and that friendly relations between France and Japan will not be affected by the actions of the League of Nations. The United States may take action, as it has done in the past, to increase the severity of the relationship between the United States and Canada, but the so-called Stimson policy cannot achieve anything. In his view, the United States will not take anti-Japanese actions, so the actions of the League of Nations will not have major consequences on Japan's economic and financial position. The anxiety felt by the American financial circles towards Japan is not due to Japan's policy towards the Asian continent, but the United States is worried that Japan's financial position will not be able to support its military actions in Manchuria.

The Japanese army in Tongliao has now reached more than 3,000 men, doubling their previous strength. At the same time, the Japanese 8th Division on the Jin-Chao line has been completely withdrawn from Yu-Sui, and the defense has been taken over by newly arrived Japanese troops. The Suzuki Brigade has moved to Yixian. The commander of the 8th Division, Nishi Yoshiichi, arrived in Yixian on the 4th with Umezu and others. Umezu and others are still staying in Jin County.

According to opinions from responsible parties, the Japanese army will likely not be fully prepared before the middle of this month. Therefore, the date of the Japanese army's launch will likely be two weeks later. As for the rumored Japanese invasion of Rehe, it likely refers to the recent repeated attacks on Kailu and Chaoyang by the Japanese army with aircraft and 2,000 infantry.

<p>Vowing to Struggle Against the Brutal Japanese to the End</p>
<p>Chengde: On the evening of the 5th, Tang Yulin hosted a banquet for the National Salvation Propaganda Troupe at the Provincial Party Headquarters. During the banquet, he gave a welcoming speech, stating, "You have braved the cold wind and snow to come from afar to assist in the anti-Japanese work. On behalf of the Provincial Party Headquarters and the Provincial Government, I express my sincere welcome and heartfelt gratitude. At this critical time in Rehe, you have risked going to the front lines to conduct widespread propaganda, awakening the determination of the military and civilians to unite and resist Japan. You have also spared no effort to film the anti-Japanese efforts of the National Army and the suffering of the people, publicizing them at home and abroad, focusing attention on Rehe and arousing unified attention. We are all very grateful for this kind of enthusiasm. Since the September 18th Incident, Rehe has been in direct conflict with Japanese imperialism. The environment has been extremely difficult in the past year. Although the brutal Japanese have repeatedly invaded, fortunately, our officers and soldiers have bravely resisted, vowing to defend every inch of our land. In the future, we should vow to struggle against the brutal Japanese to the end, striving for the survival of the nation and the integrity of sovereignty.

<h3 id="e21">Chen Shaokuan Speaks of Navy Funds Not Being Secured <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>All Plans Cannot Be Realized</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Navy Chief Chen Shaokuan said that this was the sixth time he had resigned since taking office as Minister. If oral resignations are included, it would be more than a dozen times. The Ministry of Navy bears the important responsibility of consolidating national defense, and all plans must be thorough. However, due to limited funding, they all become empty talk on paper. Building warships costs millions at every turn. The Ninghai, which was built last year, also required several million. It was ordered more than three years ago, when there was more funding, but it still has not been fully paid for to this day. From December of the year before last to January of last year, due to changes in government management of expenditures, no money was received for two months. Therefore, after the January 28th Incident, many outsiders criticized the navy for being most afraid of the enemy, and the warships' smokestacks did not emit smoke, because there was no money to buy coal. The Ministry of Navy's funding was originally more than 1.2 million yuan per month. According to the resolution of the Legislative Yuan, it had already been written off with a single stroke. However, the Ministry of Finance issued only tens or two hundred thousand yuan per month, at most no more than three hundred thousand yuan. Compared with the military expenditures of the national army, it was only a ratio of 1/60. Compared with foreign navies, it was only enough for one warship. The Ministry of Navy spends one-third of the money it receives each month on coal and oil, one-third on repairs, and one-third on maintaining the livelihood of naval officers and soldiers nationwide. How can new plans be realized with such limited funds? During the Shanghai war last year, everyone blamed the Ministry of Navy for not buying torpedoes, and said that a submarine could be bought for 2,000 yuan. The value of a torpedo is 6,000 yuan, and at least 10,000 would cost 60 million yuan. 2,000 yuan cannot buy a submarine, and we don't have even those 2,000 yuan. In short, sitting idly by deserves criticism, and my own conscience cannot bear it. Therefore, I resolutely resigned so that the government could find someone who can implement the plans that the Ministry of Navy must carry out. Now, due to urging from all sides, I am temporarily returning to the ministry. If there is hope of realizing new plans, I will still seek another responsible person to be better.

<p>Reuters Istanbul, Turkey Dispatch: Fishermen here are currently searching for the "Turkish Robinson." The man, who had lived alone on the isolated island of Oxeia for forty years, recently disappeared. This extraordinary individual, named Vansil, is a Turk of Greek descent. In 1892, due to heartbreak, he sought refuge from the world and retreated to an isolated island several miles from Istanbul, where he lived alone for forty years. During this period, he made a living by fishing. Twenty years ago, the Turkish authorities, believing that the island was uninhabited, used it as a place to exile stray dogs. For a time, Vansil was in danger of being devoured by the stray dogs, but he refused to leave and merely took precautions around his wooden house to prevent the stray dogs from rushing in. After the stray dogs died out, he regained his freedom. Recently, it was reported that he disappeared. It is thought that he has drowned.</p>

<p>Reuters, Berlin, 5th: According to reports from various parts of Germany, turmoil continues to occur, mostly clashes between the National Socialist Party and the Communist Party, some resulting in loss of life. This afternoon in Chemnitz, National Socialist Party members clashed with members of the Republican Flag League, resulting in one death and multiple injuries among the Republican Flag League members. In Breslau, a student wearing the "Iron Front" symbol was stabbed to death during a street fight, with several others injured. Police rushed to the scene, arresting several people, and order was restored. The mayor of Stassfurt was shot and killed in the town today by a seventeen-year-old student because the mayor had ordered the arrest of someone after a political disturbance occurred in the town. Serious turmoil also occurred in Munich. When ten thousand members of the National Socialist Party held a "victory parade," Communist Party members repeatedly attacked them, resulting in fighting throughout the day, with many injured and over a hundred arrested. A special police force is now stationed at the Munich National Socialist Party headquarters.</p>
<p>Dissolution of the Prussian Parliament: National, Berlin, 5th: Because the previous plan to dissolve the Prussian State Parliament failed, the Federal Government has decided to use other tactics to remove the Central and Leftist majority in the Prussian State Parliament. It is said that the government will take two steps: the first is to invoke Article 48 of the Federal Constitution and issue an emergency decree by the president to dissolve the Prussian State Parliament; the second is to remove the cabinet committee of the chairman of the Prussian state cabinet, Braun, and appoint Vice-Chancellor Papen as the central government administrative commissioner of Prussia, replacing Braun. However, whichever step is taken in the future, it will cause the people to shout out, considering it a violation of the constitution.</p>
<p>National, Berlin, 6th: Today, German President Hindenburg signed an emergency decree, dismissing the powers of the Braun cabinet in Prussia and replacing it with a new government headed by Federal Vice-Chancellor Papen. After being ordered, Papen immediately convened the Prussian State Council, attended by himself, Kerrl, and Adenauer, to formally vote to dissolve the Prussian Parliament and order Prussian parliamentary elections to be held on March 5th.</p>
<p>Hitler Refuses Official Salary: Reuters, Berlin, 6th: Hitler declared that the income he earns from writing is sufficient for his livelihood, so he does not want to receive the Prime Minister's salary. He also stated that the National Socialist Party headquarters will remain in Munich. Hitler flew from Berlin to Munich by plane yesterday to prepare for the general election on March 5th. When the Berlin Cathedral held a memorial service yesterday for a police officer and a National Socialist Party leader who were killed a few days ago, thousands of National Socialist Party stormtroopers in uniform paraded through the streets to attend the service. Despite the heavy rain, many people came from all over to attend. Hitler and other National Socialist Party leaders also attended the service. The former German Crown Prince, dressed in his old military uniform, was also among them. Since the founding of the German Republic, only two people have had public funerals held at the Berlin Cathedral: the first was the first president, Ebert, and the second was former Foreign Minister Stresemann. Today, when the motorcade traveled, several airplanes adorned with black flags flew above it, and onlookers lined the streets, many standing in the rain for hours.</p>
<p>Protest Against Restrictions on Freedom: Havas, Berlin, 5th: The order restricting freedom of the press and assembly will be promulgated tomorrow, with provisions even stricter than those promulgated by former Prime Minister Papen last June. The German Journalists' Association is greatly concerned and passed a resolution today, submitted to Hindenburg, protesting the new order restricting freedom.</p>
<p>National, Berlin, 6th: Germany recently issued an emergency decree instructing police authorities to crack down on political gatherings and newspaper reports at any time. The order was signed by President Hindenburg this morning and will be announced this afternoon. According to the order, newspapers whose text is suspected of inciting people's hearts or agitating strikes may be banned for six months. Other minor offenses, such as desecrating the President, Prime Minister, and ministers, and disseminating false news that is detrimental to the interests of the country, will be subject to appropriate penalties. According to the Berliner Tageblatt, renowned scientists, writers, and critics such as Einstein have organized a committee to protect the fundamental principles of democracy and freedom of thought and have issued a national petition.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 5th: 250,000 unemployed workers in Britain, led by former cabinet member and Labour Party leader Lansbury, staged a demonstration today, marching to Hyde Park to hold a meeting and give speeches opposing the government's economic policies. The organization of this demonstration was by the British Trades Union Congress, the Labour Party, and members of Parliament from the Labour Party. The number of participants was similar to the great assembly in 1891 demanding an eight-hour workday. Eight platforms were set up in Hyde Park, and labor leaders gave speeches, making earnest protests against wage cuts and other issues, and demanding that the government immediately change its economic policies. Lansbury led the demonstrators in singing "The Red Flag" and "The Internationale." Hyde Park and the streets at the west end were filled with 15,000 police officers, and special police officers managed city traffic and maintained order. Although the situation was tense, there was no riot, and only two people were arrested.</p>

People stopped to enjoy a parade of models. After an investigation, it was found that the bathhouse had not collapsed. It was a prank by a certain female customer, who had taken the opportunity to snatch everyone's clothes while they were running out naked.</p>

<h3 id="e71">Britain's Attitude Towards China and Accommodationists <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>In the Sino-Japanese conflict, Britain's attitude towards China has often been contradictory and elusive, sometimes pro-China, sometimes pro-Japan, and sometimes ambiguous. Recently, Foreign Secretary Simon opposed the denial of "Manchukuo" in Geneva, but suddenly heard rumors of evading departure.</p>
<p>If we observe the policies of the great powers towards China only from a political point of view, focusing on trivialities and superficial appearances, it is truly confusing. However, if we look at their economic interests and grasp the core, there is still a logical order to be found. In a word, it is to maintain and promote their rights and interests in China in order to carry out their aggression.</p>
<p>How to maintain and promote rights and interests in China? If it is within their power, they will use strong-arm tactics. If it is beyond their power, they cannot but compromise and seek accommodation. The former is exemplified by Japan in recent years, and the latter is the current Britain, which is clear and obvious. Since the Great War, the state of flux in the British Empire's colonies has worsened day by day. The revolutionary movement that has spread throughout India is enough to make British politicians think anxiously and be restless day and night. The rebellion in Ireland, a trouble at the elbow, makes them even more uneasy and at a loss. All sorts of situations make Britain feel the difficulty of colonial governance, and it is obvious that they have no more strength to manage new colonies. Since the 15th year of the Republic of China, the return of the Hankou and Xiamen concessions and the refund of the Boxer Indemnity are all clear evidence that Britain has adopted a moderate policy of accommodation towards China. This policy is the only beneficial path for Britain towards China. We firmly believe that they cannot attempt anything else.</p>
<p>The intention of this moderate policy of accommodation is mainly to seek stability in the Yangtze River basin so that Britain's commercial interests in China can be maintained without defeat. In other words, Britain's surplus goods can use this as a tail-end for dumping. This relationship has become even more important since Britain abandoned the gold standard, reduced the cost of goods, and British goods gradually replaced Japanese goods in the Yangtze River basin and southern China as a result of the boycott of Japanese goods. Therefore, on the one hand, they must win the goodwill of the Chinese, and on the other hand, they must find ways to prevent the military actions of Japanese imperialism from expanding its scope. Therefore, in addition to accommodating China, they must also accommodate Japan. However, the Sino-Japanese conflict is at its climax, so Britain, which is maneuvering between the two sides, is inevitably in a difficult position, and its diplomatic expressions cannot but be contradictory and almost impossible to explain.</p>
<p>Here, we can understand Britain's position towards China. First, Britain does not care about the Chinese nation. What Britain wants is a peaceful and backward Chinese market that can be exploited for a long time, and any humiliation suffered by the Chinese nation is not their concern. Second, Britain does not want Japan to annex the Eastern Provinces. However, in military terms, they have no remaining strength to compete with Japan in the Far East, and because the interests are minimal in the Eastern Three Provinces, they should not start a war to disrupt their economic base in the Yangtze River basin. Therefore, in addition to accommodating Japan in order to maintain the stability of the Yangtze River, North China, and South China, there is no other better way. Third, Britain's accommodation of Japan is a last resort. The purpose of accommodating Japan is to maintain the market in China, and they certainly dare not cause the Chinese to feel resentment. Otherwise, if they unfortunately cause an anti-British movement, the purpose of maintaining the market will be to harm the market. The foolishness of the British will be unparalleled.</p>
<p>From this point of view, although Britain has no territorial ambitions towards our country, objectively, it will still establish spheres of influence to carry out its economic domination. Partitioning is simply done in a different way. The policies of the great powers towards small and weak nations are consistent and cannot be avoided. We do not find it strange that Britain does this. What is painful is that the position of the accommodationists in our country is no different from that of the British. A peaceful market is what Britain needs, but it is also what our country's comprador class needs. The fall of the Eastern Three Provinces has nothing to do with Britain, but it seems that it will not harm the comprador class based in the Yangtze River basin. They are content with temporary ease and security, and they turn a blind eye to the humiliation suffered by the nation. The accommodationists of the comprador class are no different from the British. Thus, the collusion between the great powers and the comprador class to plot against us is very clear.</p>
<p>What recent events have revealed to us is that as the anti-British sentiment is rising, Britain has suddenly changed its pro-Japanese attitude. We must make it clear to those who seek to maintain their own position and interests by means of humiliating and selling out the country that they will eventually be judged by the people. Once the tide of resolute resistance rises, the accommodationists will inevitably disappear.</p>

<p>The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun reported that "Manchukuo," centered on Heihe Province, along the Heihe River and the Songhua River basin, has inexhaustible treasures. A group of reservists, totaling over two hundred people, will form a major gold vein exploration team, departing for investigation when the river thaws. On the 24th, Mr. Kuraochi Ginjiro, professor of the Engineering Department of Kyoto Imperial University and a mining investigator from the Fourth Section of the Kwantung Army Special Service Department in "Manchukuo," specifically visited Tokyo for this matter. In addition to hiring experts from Japan and selecting reservists, he also consulted with military authorities to plan the project. According to his statement, "The sand gold in the Heihe River and Songhua River basin, centered on Heihe Province, is estimated to have reserves of 5-6 billion tons. Furthermore, Russian expert Yanalt has estimated, based on on-site investigations, that there are 35 million tons of pure gold. After contacting the Colonization and Army Ministries, I will return to Manchuria to prepare everything and begin the investigation, devising methods for extraction."</p>

<h3 id="e73">He Jingwu's Proposal for Air Force Organization Plan <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Scattered Donations of Aircraft Cannot Save the Nation</p>
<p>The People Should Autonomously Establish an Air Force</p>
<p>Solicit Five Hundred Donation Units</p>
<p>Limit the Fundraising to Fifty Million Yuan by the End of This Year</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: He Jingwu, Commissioner of the Pinghan Railway, spoke at the railway's anniversary celebration the other day about the necessity of organizing a national air force. The following is a record of his speech: Colleagues, we bear two immense responsibilities. One is how to manage the Pinghan Railway well, and the other is how to save the nation. I have spoken a lot about the railway in the past. Today, let's discuss a major national issue, which is saving the nation through aviation. Why is aviation so important for saving the nation? Let me explain this in several points:</p>
<p>First, the necessity of air force equipment. The modern world is a world of air force competition. Since the September 18th Incident, the national crisis has worsened day by day. Many Chinese people have proposed ways to save the nation, and their theories are all correct, but unfortunately, no one has put them into practice. I, Jingwu, am a soldier and advocate resolute resistance. However, resistance requires military strength. What is our military strength like? China's navy has only 70,000 to 80,000 tons of warships. Japan's navy has more than ten times that tonnage. Can we compete with such a disparity? I don't think anyone in the navy would give a positive answer. What about the army? The Chinese army's ability to endure war is not weaker than Japan's. The Battle of Shanghai proved this. Although our weapons are slightly weaker, our spirit is excellent. Moreover, our land is vast. Their tanks and flat-trajectory guns, though powerful, can only be used on plains. We can leave the plains and engage them in close combat in the mountains. As in Jehol now, the enemy cannot use these powerful weapons. Each Japanese division has 12,000 men in peacetime and 25,000 men in wartime. Even if they send twenty divisions, that's only 500,000 men, which is not enough to divide forces across China. Nor can they shamelessly claim, as the Japanese militarists do, that they can occupy Shanghai in three hours and all of China in two weeks. As long as we wage a protracted war against them, victory will not necessarily belong to Japan. The number of our current army is probably dozens of times more than Japan's in the Northeast. Therefore, the army can fight. Our biggest difficulty is the air force. Japan's air force strength is about 2,000 aircraft. After deducting some for national defense, they can hypothetically fly about 1,000 aircraft to China. Warships, tanks, and flat-trajectory guns all have geographical limitations. Only aircraft can fly everywhere. If we don't have an air force to counter them and protect our airspace, they can use their superior aircraft to sweep across our important cities, bomb our arsenals, destroy our ordnance factories, and disrupt our transportation lines in the shortest time, making it impossible for our army to transport supplies, and our bullets cannot be replenished. We would lose our inherent fighting power. That's when we would truly suffer. This is why the Chinese people are frantically calling for saving the nation through aviation. I personally believe that although Chinese aircraft cannot fly to Japan to bomb them, we can make every effort to resist the incoming Japanese aircraft. For example, if Japan sends 1,000 aircraft, we can resist them if we have 500. In the Battle of Shanghai, the Japanese army failed repeatedly, and the navy did not inflict much damage on us. Our losses were entirely due to our inability to defend our airspace, and we were freely bombed by Japanese aircraft. If we had an air force comparable to Japan's to counter them, the Japanese aircraft could be driven away, and Zhabei would not have suffered such losses, and the army would have been victorious. Therefore, to strengthen our national defense, the only way is to increase our air force strength. Otherwise, we will never be able to maintain our national lifeline. Although we have a large population of 400 million and a good spirit, we can only perish together under the enemy's aircraft. The national crisis is imminent. We cannot expand our navy in the shortest time due to economic and time constraints. Only buying more aircraft is something that the people's wealth can achieve.</p>
<p>Second, the shortcomings of the air force in the past. China is not without an air force now, but why can't it fight against others? This is certainly due to the lack of numbers, but the biggest reason is the lack of an organized system. The country's aircraft have become the personal bodyguards of military men. Only individuals can use them, and the government has no power to control and dispatch them. Aviation personnel have also become soldiers of various departments, not soldiers of the country. We hear the sinking of the Flying Eagle warship and the explosion of aircraft in Sichuan. We can only wait for the country to perish. The equipment of the existing airfields in the country is also very rudimentary. Other manufacturing plants, ammunition factories, and material factories have not been prepared. If this situation is not improved, we cannot talk about defending the country, and we cannot talk about saving the country.</p>
<p>Third, the failures of donating aircraft in the past. Since the Battle of Shanghai, the Chinese people have deeply felt the importance of the air force. The call to save the nation through aviation has resounded throughout the country. Many patriotic people have voluntarily donated aircraft to the government. This is certainly very good, but these scattered donations, which are gradually destroyed, cannot increase the strength of national defense. The shortcoming is still the lack of an overall organization and system. Air force combat is not like the army, where a small force can defeat a larger force. It is entirely a matter of numerical proportion. Because the weapons on aircraft are limited, the combat power of each aircraft cannot be very different. A small number of aircraft will naturally be destroyed by a large number of aircraft. Last year, during the Battle of Shanghai, twelve Japanese aircraft attacked Hangzhou, and we countered with six aircraft. Although we destroyed two of them, we ultimately failed. Also, in the Suzhou area, one of our fighter aircraft, piloted by an American, was surrounded by four Japanese aircraft and was shot down. The pilot also died in the line of duty. Therefore, air force combat must concentrate forces to win.</p>
<p>Fourth, how should we organize the air force? The importance of the air force and the shortcomings of our country's air force in the past have been described above. How should we remedy and reverse this in the future? I believe that the only way is for the people to organize themselves automatically. I now formally propose that the Pinghan Railway initiate the establishment of a National Air Force Founding Association to publicize it nationwide and create five hundred units, each unit donating one aircraft. We, the Pinghan Railway, will establish the National Air Force Founding Association starting today. All employees of the railway are members of the branch association and will first pledge to donate one aircraft, named "Pinghan." Then, we will persuade various roads, provinces, cities, counties, legal entities, and patriotic people across the country to donate. If each major road donates one aircraft and several smaller roads jointly donate one aircraft, we can obtain ten units from the railway industry alone. In addition, we can obtain at least five or six aircraft from the postal and telegraph services. The Seamen's Union is powerful and can also pledge to donate several aircraft. In total, the transportation industry can pledge twenty units. China has more than 1,000 counties. If each large county donates one aircraft and two or three small counties jointly donate one aircraft, we can obtain hundreds of units. In addition, if various provinces, special cities, agencies, professional groups, and public-spirited capitalists, all aware that the country will soon perish, generously donate, I think it will not be difficult to raise 500 units. These 500 units should be completed by the end of 1933. At the same time, the National Air Force Founding Association should be established in Shanghai. We should then petition the government to expand the existing Aviation Administration into the Air Force Department and, together with the National Air Force Founding Association, establish the procedures for air force construction, actively prepare aircraft material factories, ammunition factories, and airfields, and train at least 500 pilots each year. In this way, the Chinese air force will be planned, organized, whole rather than scattered, national rather than privately owned, and used for national defense rather than for internal warfare. With this great force to defend against enemy aircraft attacks and protect our army, we can certainly achieve great results in military affairs. This is my proposal. The rise and fall of the world are the responsibility of every individual. If my patriotic colleagues think this is feasible, let's organize ourselves. Let's designate this week as the day for external publicity. All employees should be divided into groups to promote the significance of saving the nation through aviation. Everything depends on human effort. As long as we work hard, there is nothing we cannot achieve. This issue concerns the lifeblood of the country and is the responsibility of every individual. To save the nation, each individual must do it themselves. We must not passively hope that others will do it while forgetting ourselves, nor should we underestimate ourselves and think that we are insignificant. Men of the Pinghan Railway, come, let's combine our hot blood with the hot blood of our compatriots across the country, organize a national air force to save the nation, and fight to the death with the powerful enemy.</p>
<p>The Shandong Militia Corps Will Restore Its Old Strength</p>
<h3 id="e74">Augmenting the Military Force of the People <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: In recent years, Shandong Province has been actively reorganizing the militia corps and has achieved considerable results. Recently, the provincial government, deeply concerned about the daily increasing foreign aggression, has changed the four militia districts into five routes and intensified training. Li Shuchun, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, also submitted a memorandum to the provincial government last month regarding the reform of the militia corps, advocating the restoration of the old militia corps strength: 300 for first-class counties, 200 for second-class counties, and 100 for third-class counties, and the purchase of additional firearms and the organization of bare-handed broadsword teams to augment the military force of the people. In addition, he also made recommendations on the establishment of special management agencies and the distribution of militia corps salaries. The memorandum was sent to the Departments of Civil Affairs and Finance for review. According to the reply, it was deemed inappropriate to make changes mid-year as the twenty-first year had not yet ended. It was suggested to reconsider the local conditions in the twenty-second year and submit a request for approval. At today's (3rd) provincial government administrative meeting, the case was brought up for discussion again. It was resolved to approve the proposal. The original text of the proposal is recorded on the left: "Report from the Secretariat: The Departments of Civil Affairs and Finance jointly reported that they were ordered to review the memorandum submitted by the Department of Civil Affairs regarding the organization and training of the militia corps. After careful review, it was found that all the items listed in the memorandum under the headings 1) System, 2) Training, and 3) Organization were appropriate and should be approved as proposed. However, there are three items that should be specially regulated, which have also been agreed upon after consultation, and the measures are presented below: 1) Regarding the establishment of a special management agency for the proposed militia corps headquarters, it is proposed that the government set up a militia corps section in the responsible department or designate several officials to handle militia corps affairs exclusively. 2) Regarding the militia corps salaries proposed in the original memorandum for each county, which should be submitted by each county to the Department of Finance for transfer to the district command headquarters for monthly distribution, this method of transferring and disbursing is too cumbersome and difficult. It should continue to be handled according to the current method, with the county government issuing the salaries nearby each month and reporting to the headquarters and district headquarters for record-keeping. 3) Regarding the restoration of the old militia corps strength in each county (i.e., 300 for first-class counties, 200 for second-class counties, and 100 for third-class counties) and the purchase of additional firearms and the organization of bare-handed broadsword teams, the current number of militia corps and salaries in each county have already been approved by the government and included in the twenty-first year's county local budget. It is not appropriate to make changes mid-year. It should continue to be handled according to the current year's budget. It is suggested to reconsider the local conditions in the twenty-second year and submit a request for approval. The above three items have been repeatedly discussed, and the opinions are the same. Is this appropriate? Please submit for approval. If approved, please issue an order for implementation, etc."</p>

<p>The Daladier Cabinet is Increasingly Unstable</p>
<h3 id="e75">The Socialist Party Will Not Join the Government, and the Central Parties Will Not Support It <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Paris, 6th (National Telegram): The position of the French Daladier Cabinet is now increasingly unstable, as the executive committee of the Socialist Party decided today not to join the new government. Their support for the government is entirely dependent on whether the government can vigorously implement radical policies. If the government cannot implement radical policies, the Socialist Party members in the parliament will vote against the government. The current public opinion circles believe that the Daladier Cabinet, under such circumstances, will fail if it cannot obtain the support of the central parties. However, the central parties may not necessarily have any goodwill towards the new government either.</p>
<p>Paris, 5th (Havas): At a public banquet held by the Republican press, President Lebrun stated that the current situation is serious and that immediate efforts are needed to improve the financial situation. However, the expressions of various regions seem to resist this effort. Therefore, the task of the press at present is to eliminate temporary impulses, rectify the situation, and advise the people to assist the country within their proper scope.</p>
<p>Paris, 5th (Havas): The Socialist Party's national executive committee continued its meeting in the evening. Representative Lelorre supported joining the cabinet, saying that this was necessary to maintain the left-wing majority. Then, the party leader Blum explained in detail the activities of the party's representatives, saying that the party should not be bound by the two issues of supporting or opposing joining the cabinet, because even if it does not join the cabinet, there are still those who can be assisted. Blum said that he hoped the Daladier cabinet could last for a long time. He believed that there was a danger of the parliamentary majority party changing direction. If the Socialist Party did not firmly oppose the government, this danger could be avoided. In his view, there was a great possibility for the Socialist and Radical parties to reconcile with each other to maintain the cabinet. However, several party members proposed motions that contradicted his opinions. Despite Blum's best efforts to persuade them, they were not withdrawn. One motion advocated adhering to the decision of the party's national congress and leaving the issue of joining the cabinet to the party's national congress for further decision. The request from the Radical Party to form a standing committee jointly by the two parties was rejected. This motion was passed with 2,636 votes.</p>
<p>Marseille, 5th (Havas): Members of the central and right-wing Republican parties held an important meeting, chaired by Representative, former cabinet member, and Vice-President of the Republican Federation, Lybert. Lybert emphasized that the situation was serious, and the majority party showed incompetence after the general election of the parliament. Therefore, the various parties should be reorganized and a cabinet with a definite backing should be formed in order to implement necessary reforms.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Mutiny in the Dutch Navy <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Officers Imprisoned, Ships Seized, and Escape</p>
<p>The Hague Authorities Dispatched Ships to Pursue and Arrest</p>
<p>The Hague, 5th (National News Agency): After the Dutch Navy reduced salaries, soldiers stationed in Asia harbored resentment. There had already been two instances of insubordination within a week. Recently, there was a mutiny and ship seizure, becoming the most serious situation in the history of the Dutch Navy stationed in Asia. This time, the ships were returning to Oelee Harbour after exercises in the Celebes Sea. All the senior officers went ashore, and soldiers on the cruiser HNLMS Tromp suddenly imprisoned nine junior officers and seized the ship. It is now being pursued by the auxiliary ship HNLMS Altair and several gunboats. Naval personnel here, based on reports from the Governor of Northwest Sumatra, are deeply concerned that the mutinous soldiers will suddenly enter Surabaya, occupy the port, and release the four hundred insubordinate sailors who were arrested a few days ago. This is because the Governor received a report from a gunboat stating that the cruiser was seen west of Meulaboh in Northwest Sumatra Province, heading towards Surabaya at full speed. The pursuing ships are clearly communicating with the mutinous ship by radio, so they reported to the Governor that the mutineers seized the ammunition depot before imprisoning the officers, so they have ample ammunition and are prepared to resist. However, it is still unknown whether the Dutch fleet is prepared to besiege the ship at sea or force it to enter Surabaya Harbour.</p>

<p>London, 6th (Reuters): The famous aviator Jim Mollison took off from Lympne Airport at 8:11 this morning in his aircraft, "The Heart's Content," bound for Natal, Brazil, with an estimated flight time of three and a half days. About an hour before Mollison's departure, Squadron Leader Gayford and Flight Lieutenant Nicholetts also took off from Cranwell in their aircraft bound for Cape Town, planning to fly non-stop. If all goes well, they will reach Tunis tomorrow. This trip requires flying 5,074 miles to break the long-distance record set by the Americans Boardman and Polando from New York to Constantinople. The aircraft is equipped with an automatic pilot, whose accuracy cannot be matched even by the most skilled pilots.</p>
<p>Cranwell, 6th (National News Agency): Royal Air Force Squadron Leader Gayford and Flight Lieutenant Nicholetts took off from here at 7:15 this morning in a specially made Fairey Long-Range Monoplane, intending to fly non-stop directly to Plettenberg Bay, aiming to break the world long-distance aviation record held by the United States. The world record was set by American aviators Boardman and Polando in July 1931, flying non-stop from New York to Istanbul, a distance of 5,012 miles. Today's flight from Cranwell to Cape Town is about 6,000 miles, and it is planned to fly for sixty hours.</p>
<h3 id="e78">After the Communist Bandits Fled into Sichuan Province <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>The Bandits are Fleeing in Two Routes</p>
<p>They are Now Being Heavily Besieged by Various Armies</p>
<p>Chengdu Correspondence: The Communist bandits He Long, Kuang Jixun, and Xu Xiangqian, unable to establish a foothold in the coal mines on the border of Shaanxi, took advantage of the chaotic situation in Sichuan to attack Sichuan. One part attacked Sichuan from the north of Shaanxi, while another part was active in Chengkou and Badong, attacking the main force in northern Sichuan, namely Xu Xiangqian, and the forces active in Chengkou and Badong were He Long and Kuang Jixun. The purpose of these two forces combined was to seize the entire northern Sichuan. At that time, the Sichuan warlords underestimated the strength of the bandits. Only after the fall of counties such as Chengkou and Tongjiang did they become alarmed and urgently mobilized troops to block them.</p>
<p>Before Kuang Jixun's troops entered Sichuan, villages near the Wanyuan and Zhuxi passes were suddenly looted by bandits, killing many local security personnel and posting reactionary slogans, which were naturally the work of the Communist bandits. Liu Cunhou, the Sichuan-Shaanxi Border Defense Commissioner stationed in Suiding, ordered Commander Liao Liangchen stationed in Dongxiang, Chengkou, and Wanyuan to guard the key passes of Lianghekou and Zhuyemiao, while also transferring his younger brother Liu Zhaogan's division from Chengdu to return to Suiding to defend. As a result, the reinforcements did not arrive, and Chengkou had already fallen, greatly alarming Wanyuan and Suiding. At the same time, Liu Zhaogan's division had won considerable victories in participating in the Allied Forces' operations and was confronting the 24th Army between Chengdu and Shuangliu. He was unwilling to be transferred back to Suiding to suppress the bandits and was preparing to seek new opportunities in the future. Under this extremely anxious situation, Liu Cunhou appealed to the various Sichuan armies to cease fighting and suppress the bandits together, while also contacting the Shaanxi authorities for joint suppression. At this time, the Central Army's two divisions under Hu Zongnan and Liu Maoen were pursuing the Communist bandits. Chengkou was recovered by Liu's division, and Kuang Jixun and his troops changed their strategy and dispersed. One group went deep into the interior of Sichuan towards Wanyuan and Suiding, while another group developed towards Tongjiang, Zhaohua, and Guangyuan. Because Kuang Jixun was originally a Sichuan soldier, he was very familiar with the terrain of Sichuan Province and the internal situation of the Sichuan army.</p>
<p>Tongjiang and Nanjiang bordered Shaanxi Province. After years of exploitation by troops and local bullies, the local vitality had long been exhausted. In addition, there had been continuous droughts and a vast disaster area. Since the outbreak of the Sichuan War, after Tian Songyao became the main force of the Sichuan War, the remote areas were particularly heavily taxed for military expenses, and the people could not afford to supply them. This environment was conducive to the incitement of communism. Tongjiang and Nanjiang had previously been dens of bandits. Now that the Communist Party had infiltrated, the previously hidden bandits were revived. Before Kuang Jixun and his troops reached Tongjiang and Nanjiang, peasants in Tongjiang suddenly rioted, stormed into the city, destroyed the county government, and the county magistrate was killed. A mutiny also occurred in Nanjiang at the same time, responding to the Communist bandits. More local farmers, unable to pay the exorbitant taxes, also became peasant bandits. They occupied the mountains, with bandits with guns in the inner layer and bandits with bare hands in the outer layer. As a result, Kuang Jixun and his troops gained great momentum and spread to Bazhong, Cangxi, and other places in southern Sichuan. Kuang intended that once Bazhong was captured, he could drive straight into the entire northern Sichuan, and then attack Yingshan and Qu County from the Jiangkou Township of Bazhong. Moreover, before Kuang's troops reached Bazhong and other places, Zhang Youqi and others in Sunjia Temple in Nanbu County dragged away the local militia, raised the red flag, and planned to lead their troops to attack Nanbu County. It was also reported that Gong Xinyi and Liu Kunlun, bandits in Shunqing and Pengxi, were also in contact with Kuang's troops. At that time, the city of Nanbu was closed, and there was great panic. When the 25th Regiment of the Third Division of Tian Songyao's 29th Army stationed in Nanchong heard the news and rushed to the scene, Zhang Youqi led his troops and thousands of farmers to the Siyi Market, Jinxiangu, and Dongjiao Temple areas near Cangxi in the south. Government troops are now tracking and pursuing them.</p>
<p>It is reported that the participants in the bandit suppression in Tian's army include the First Route under Li Weiruo, the Second Route under Liu Hanxiong, the 14th Brigade under Luo Shaolin, the Garrison Commander Tian Zefu, one brigade of the Third Division under Luo Naiqiong, and the entire Independent Division under Fen Jiantang, totaling more than twenty regiments. The two divisions of the Central Army under Hu Zongnan and Liu Maoen, and the Shaanxi Army under Wang Zhiyuan, who entered Sichuan from southern Shaanxi, have established contact with Liu Cunhou's troops and are implementing a strategy of encircling the Communist bandits. Therefore, the Communist bandits will not easily succeed.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Yu Hanmou Returns to Guangdong from Southern Jiangxi <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Recently, leaders from various southwestern provinces gathered in Guangzhou to discuss the issue of jointly suppressing the bandits. Principles have been agreed upon and handed over to Huang Shaohong to bring back to Nanjing for examination and approval by the central government. Later, due to the issue of bandit suppression, it was still necessary for Yu Hanmou, commander of the First Army stationed in southern Jiangxi, to return to Guangdong to participate and provide his opinion. Chen Jitang telegraphed Yu to return to the province, and Yu telegraphed back that he would set out immediately. Therefore, Huang Shaohong originally scheduled to take a steamer from Guangzhou to Hong Kong on the morning of January 30 and then go north, but he suspended his trip and stayed in Guangdong to wait for Yu. It is reported that Yu left Dayu garrison on January 30, accompanied by Li Xuhuan, a political training student of the First Army, and flew to Shaozhou. He arrived in Shaozhou at 2:30 pm. Yu inspected the defense of the North River and stayed in Shaozhou overnight. On the morning of the 31st, he returned to Guangzhou by special train from Guangzhou to Shaozhou. First, he went to Chen Jitang's residence in the Dongshan Model Village to report on the progress of the Guangdong army's bandit suppression in southern Jiangxi and the recent plight of the Jiangxi Communist bandits. Finally, he discussed major plans such as bandit suppression and resistance against Japan. Yu also believed that the First Army had a close relationship with future bandit suppression. If the 19th Route Army stationed in Fujian was ordered to go north to resist the invaders, the defense of Fujian Province would have to be taken over by troops dispatched by the Guangdong army. Yu then visited Cai Tingkai to discuss everything, and then visited Huang Shaohong, Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, and others, reportedly to discuss major plans for resisting Japan. But the main figures will hold another meeting during the day. Yu participated in the meeting and then returned to his garrison on February 1.</p>
<h3 id="e80">New Book Donation to Shandong Library <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Leftover from Henan's Liu Chunzhai</p>
<p>Ninety Boxes of Books, Calligraphy and Paintings</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Liu Chunzhai from Zhigou, Henan, was a renowned book collector. He once traveled to Shandong for business. When he passed away the year before last, he left a will donating sixty-eight boxes of books to the Shandong Library. The library had already requested the provincial government to send personnel to oversee the inventory. Besides these sixty-eight boxes, there were also twenty-two boxes of calligraphy and paintings. Because Liu owed debts to Xu Xiaohang and Wei Fucun, the court ordered an auction to repay the debts. After negotiations by the library, the twenty-two boxes of calligraphy and paintings were donated to the library under the names of Xu and Wei. The library provided 750 yuan to prevent losses and gave Liu's family 1,000 yuan as funeral expenses for Liu Chunzhai. The Department of Education submitted this matter to the provincial government's political affairs meeting on the 3rd, and it was resolved to approve the proposal. The original text of the Education Department's proposal is recorded below: "According to the report from Wang Xiantang, the director of the Provincial Library, Mr. Liu from Fugou, Henan, donated sixty-eight boxes of books to our library, which were previously inventoried by personnel sent by the provincial government. In addition, there are twenty-two boxes of calligraphy and books. Because Liu owed debts to Xu Xiaohang and Wei Fucun, the Jinan District Court auctioned them off at the request of the creditors to repay the debts. Our library believes that these books were clearly designated for the library in the will of Liu's ancestor, Mr. Chunzhai, so their ownership no longer belongs to his descendants and cannot be used to repay debts. At the same time, Liu's descendants are donating these books to our library, and our library has the right to accept them according to law. We have already submitted a request to your department to send a letter to the High Court to demand their return. Our library has also filed an objection with the Jinan District Court. After several court sessions, the creditors are willing to give up the right to auction and return the items to our library. Moreover, Liu had already gone bankrupt and had no other property to repay the debts. The value of the books is used as Liu's debt repayment. Although the procedure for donating the books to our library under the names of Xu and Wei has changed, the original intention has been achieved. We should gladly accept it. After inspecting the calligraphy and paintings, the Jinan District Court initially estimated their value at 2,639.5 yuan. Xu and Wei are not wealthy. Although they are generously donating to the public, according to principles of fairness, the government should provide them with a small subsidy to show its consideration, intending to give them 750 yuan to avoid losses and to encourage donations from all sectors. Furthermore, Mr. Liu Shigu, a descendant of the ancient gentleman Liu, donated sixty-eight boxes of books according to the will of his grandfather, Mr. Chunzhai, estimated to be worth more than 20,000 yuan, which is the largest donation since the library's establishment. However, Liu suffered losses in business, and his property was sold off. Mr. Chunzhai's coffin is still in Jinan, and there is no money to transport it back to his hometown. The government should also provide some assistance to alleviate his suffering, intending to award 1,000 yuan for funeral expenses, to be received by his grandson, Shigu, to transport the coffin back to his hometown on a specified date for funeral purposes, so as to prevent creditors from seizing it. All two items of expenses, totaling 1,750 yuan, should be budgeted and submitted for approval and allocation." Based on this, Liu and Xu, Wei, donate significant book and calligraphy worth a great deal to the library. It is deemed appropriate to grant 1,000 yuan for Liu's funeral expenses and 750 yuan to subsidize Xu and Wei for the book value, respectively. It should be covered by the 21st year of education preparatory expenses item, should it be approved or not, please make a decision." (4th)</p>
<h3 id="e81">Bandits in Songjiang Resist Arrest, Killing Soldiers <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>On the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway tracks at the 31st Foreign Bridge in Shihudang, a village within the county, at around 6 PM on the 5th of this month, a cake vendor was selling his goods when three bandits suddenly came forward and robbed him of over 1,900 copper coins. He immediately reported to the nearby Third Battalion, Twelfth Company police outpost of the Second Security Regiment, which was stationed to guard the bridge. Guard soldier Wu Nairu went to pursue and caught one of the bandits, confiscating a homemade pistol, a small firearm, and eight bullets from his person. He brought the bandit back to the outpost for questioning. Around 11 PM, more than ten bandits suddenly arrived, carrying about five or six handguns. They stormed into the outpost, intending to rob and free the captured bandit. Seeing this, the guards ordered the group to disperse in preparation to capture the arriving bandits. The bandits opened fire, and the captured bandit took the opportunity to escape by swimming away. Soldier Wu bravely pursued them but was shot in the left chest by the bandits. The bullet did not pass through, and he died instantly. The remaining soldiers returned fire, and bullets flew everywhere. Another bandit was re-captured, suffering a gunshot wound to the forehead. The bandits, unable to withstand the force, scattered and fled. However, the area is crisscrossed by waterways and is a known haunt for bandits, and it was already late at night, so they were not pursued further. On the afternoon of the 6th, the captured bandit was escorted to the regimental headquarters. After a preliminary interrogation by Deputy Regiment Commander Wan, he confessed his name as Li Runfa, 28 years old, from Ningbo. He had previously served as a soldier in the Third Company of the First Security Battalion of Zhejiang and had committed robberies in Jiaxing, Pinghu, and other places. He did not deny the robbery of the cake vendor's copper coins and resisting arrest. During the incident, in addition to guard soldier Wu Nairu's immediate death, two small firearms were damaged by the bandits. The bandit is currently temporarily detained in the county prison, and the soldier's body has been transported to Songjiang, awaiting family members to arrive to collect it for burial.</p>

<p>The Litchuan and River China (Hehua) small steamships of the Suzhou China Merchants Inland River Steamship Bureau usually carry passengers between Suzhou and Hangzhou. On the 5th, the Litchuan ship towed a scrap ship from the Waste Profits Company and a pig boat, carrying more than 50 passengers. It departed from Suzhou at 3 PM. Two plainclothes bandits were mixed among the passengers. When the ship passed Wujiang, five more bandits disguised as passengers and disembarked. When the ship reached Duiqiao, the seven bandits pulled out handguns, threatened to stop the ship, and robbed at will. A hotel worker was robbed of 150 yuan, a butcher lost 50 yuan, and a female passenger lost a gold bracelet. In total, approximately 500 to 600 yuan in cash was robbed. The bandits then jumped into the pig boat, untied the rope, and fled.</p>

The plane was slightly damaged, and Zhang suffered minor abrasions on his face, lips, and chest. His knees were more seriously injured. He was sent to Guangji Hospital for treatment. Except for his left knee, which still needs to be examined by X-ray for any fractures, the other injuries are not serious. Zhang is from Hefei, Anhui. He graduated from Jinan Aviation School in 1925. He has participated in various campaigns to suppress rebellion and bandits. He came to Hangzhou last September to assume his current position.</p>

<h3 id="e88">Chen Youren Expresses His Diplomatic Views on Japan <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>States That His Advocacy for Severing Relations Has Not Changed</p>
<p>Will Definitely Not Lead to a World War</p>
<p>Former Foreign Minister Chen Youren, after returning to Shanghai from Europe the night before last, has sparked much speculation about his sudden return home. Yesterday at 6 PM, Chen met with reporters from Chinese and Western newspapers at his residence on Avenue Road. Chen stated that he would not be going to Nanjing for the time being, nor would he be willing to take on any position. As for his advocacy for severing relations with Japan, it has not changed. The summary of his conversation is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e89">Tired of Traveling, Now Returning Home <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Reporters first asked Chen if he had any mission upon returning to Shanghai and whether he was responding to a government summons. Chen said that he was living in exile. He went abroad to Europe for travel in June last year and has been away for seven months. Therefore, he is returning home because he is tired of traveling. He was not summoned by anyone in the government, nor does he have any mission.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Advocacy Unchanged <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Chen continued to answer reporters' questions, stating that his previous advocacy for severing relations with Japan and other opinions remains unchanged. Regarding the international situation, he said that other countries view us as beggars pleading for sympathy. He also believes that our country should mobilize the entire nation as one to show that we are not weak and do not rely solely on others. Only in this way can we gain international respect. Otherwise, as it is today, we are completely relying on the League of Nations, giving other countries the impression that we are underestimating our country's position. No one pays attention to the mournful sound of a beggar. Moreover, Japan has already exchanged views with Britain and France on the League of Nations. To Britain, they mentioned Britain's India in the Far East. To France, they mentioned French Annam. Therefore, Britain and France, each for their own interests, are unwilling to become enemies with Japan. Our pleas to others will only end up as an illusion.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Will Not Cause a Major War <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Chen also stated that even if the Manchurian problem leads to a split, it will definitely not lead to a second world war, because the United States would definitely not dare to declare war today, unless Britain and the United States unite and confront Japan together. However, there is no possibility of cooperation between Britain and the United States. Chen did not give his reasons for why Britain and the United States cannot unite, but it is rumored that there are complex war debt issues between Britain and the United States.</p>
<h3 id="e92">What is the Diplomatic Strategy? <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Chen also said that all countries have their own set diplomatic policies. Therefore, when handling diplomacy, they only need to proceed according to their established diplomatic policies. For example, when British Ambassador Lampson is stationed in China, all matters can be freely conducted according to his country's long-standing policies, with a complete framework for handling them. What is our country's diplomatic policy?</p>
<h3 id="e93">Moral Sanctions <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>When Chen spoke about foreign affairs, he cited Japanese history from 1867 as proof. He continued to say that relying on the League of Nations will ultimately fail. The League of Nations can only impose moral sanctions. Relying solely on the League of Nations is useless. He believes that we should have already issued a declaration to the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the countries in the Washington Conference (i.e., the Nine-Power Treaty), urging them to convene a meeting. The main purpose is to have the United States formally participate, so that the resolution has the power to be implemented in reality. Regarding the issue of the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, Chen believes that this is only the restoration of diplomatic relations. There should be further work. In addition, Chen also mentioned the issue of economic boycott of Japanese goods, saying that the current economic severance of relations is not enough to cause any loss to Japanese businesses, because Japanese goods can still be imported into China in disguise through India. Finally, Chen said that he would not go to Nanjing, because even if he were to become the Foreign Minister, he would still not be able to exert his authority to realize his advocacy. Therefore, what is the point of going to Nanjing?</p>

<p>Although the Aviation Association has not yet completed preparations and has not yet started to publicly solicit members, various places have been sending letters and telegrams to request the articles of association and membership application forms. At least several arrive daily. A reporter from the Central News Agency was at the association yesterday when Director Wang Rutang called and requested one thousand copies of the articles of association, which shows the enthusiasm of various circles to join the association. There are also many donations from various places. In addition, He Xiangyu, a 14-year-old boy from Haimen, Zhejiang, sent a letter to the association and attached four yuan of New Year's money to buy a children's aircraft. The association commended his patriotic fervor and published the original letter to encourage others. The original letter reads: "To President (Association head) Greetings! Yesterday, I saw in the newspaper that four patriotic children donated four yuan, the money they earned selling food for their savings, to the mayor, who gave it to your association, to buy airplanes to fight the Japanese. This kind of fervent patriotism makes me extremely admire them! I am also a 14-year-old Chinese boy. If I do not donate money to buy airplanes to save the country, then others will probably scold me as a unpatriotic child and also do an injustice to these four patriotic initiators. I dare not lag behind others, so I donated the four yuan given to me by my parents in the new year to your association to buy an airplane 'Children's Plane!' Although this money is insignificant, I think the children throughout the country will certainly support as I do. In the previous days, four patriotic like-minded brothers donated some money to buy an airplane to fight the Japanese. Then this 'Children's Plane' will be successful. From He Xiangyu, fourteen years old, a child from salt shop Alley of Haimen, Zhejiang"</p>

<h3 id="e102">The All-Shanghai Real Estate Industry Holds an Emergency Meeting Yesterday Regarding the Water Fee Dispute <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Resolved to Issue a Declaration Jointly with the Western Property Owners Association</p>
<p>The Public Works Department Held a Meeting to Discuss the Case Yesterday</p>
<p>Representatives of Chinese and Western Property Owners Met with the Secretary of the Public Works Department Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association, in view of the fact that the British-owned Water Company has installed water meters and increased water charges by several times compared to before, causing not only extra losses to landlords but also unsettling to the city's residents, convened an emergency meeting at the association yesterday afternoon at 4 PM to discuss response measures. In the morning, Dou Yaoting, a member of the association's standing committee, along with the two chairmen of the Western Property Owners Association, met with Jones, the Secretary of the Public Works Department, to report that the current water fee problem has reached a serious stage. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e103">Members Present <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Around 3 PM in the afternoon, representatives from various property owners arrived at the meeting, including representatives from Delly, Yicheng, Xiyuan, Gu Lanji, Central Trust Company, Dong Yu, Cheng Yu, Changtai, Taili, Xinghe, Yizhong Yin Company, Yongqing Ruiji, Darley Accountants, Zhongde, Xichangxing, Zhonghe, China Land Reclamation Bank, Gaochang, Xu Xiangji, the trust department of the Continental Bank, Zhenyi, Mingchang, Wei Chengji, He Kun Trust Company, Jingji, Yide, Yunji, Fenxing, Hexing, Jiuxing, Shenyutang, Donglai Bank, Zhou Gengji, Changfeng, Dayufeng, Xiangmao Foreign Firm, Longzhang, Huada, Sanjin, Zhenye, Xielong, Jingqin, and China Business Company.

<h3 id="e104">Important Matters Resolved <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Shen Jixuan and recorders Tao Leqin and Zeng Xianyuan started by having Standing Committee Member Li Bohan report on the disputes after the installation of water meters. Then, representatives from Delly Company, Qinyu Company, Yizhong Yin Company, Darley Accountants, and others reported on the circumstances of their water being cut off by the Water Company. Next, Standing Committee Member Dou Yaoting reported on the circumstances of contacting the Water Company after the water was cut off in various places, and the meeting with the Secretary of the Public Works Department. After everyone expressed their opinions, they were very agitated about the Water Company's sudden water cutoff. The chairman summarized the opinions and resolved the following important matters: 1. Issue a joint declaration with the Western Property Owners Association. 2. The issue of universal water meter installation will be resolved after the results of the Public Works Committee meeting this afternoon (today). 3. If the Water Company continues to cut off the water or cuts it off without turning it back on, implement emergency self-defense measures permitted by law. 4. Schedule a reception for various sectors to explain the content of the water case and its relationship to the interests of various sectors. 5. Upon receiving the Western Property Owners Association's notification, inform each property owner to make a blank form report, submit it to the police station for record-keeping every month, and send a letter to the police station to prepare and issue blank forms. Other cases were then discussed and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Water Cutoffs in Various Places <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>During yesterday's meeting, various representatives reported the following situations: 1. Delly Company's water to Huasheng Road, Fenzhou Road, and Bolu in Yangshupu was cut off at 11 AM on December 5th of last year. The tenants reopened it themselves. 2. The water to more than one hundred buildings of Huada Company on Zhoujiazui Road and Shuncheng Li in Yangshupu was cut off, with the monthly charge still being the same with the package delivery. The total stopcock was closed on December 15th, at 3 PM. The company still did not turn the water back on. For a hundred buildings in Yuanfu Li on Tangpu Road and Baoding Road, the water company used water meters from July. The water fees increased by more than four times. On January 24th, the company sent a letter to each tenant saying that if the water fee was not paid, they would have to stop supplying water. At 2 PM on the 2nd of this month, the water was cut off. The tenants reopened it themselves. 3. Fenxing Company received a letter from the water company stating that it owed more than 150 yuan and must be paid before February 1st, otherwise the water would be cut off. The company's water was cut off on the 2nd. The tenants jointly discussed and reopened it themselves. 4. The water to two hundred and fifty buildings of Yizhong Yin Company in Huaxin Fang on Yangshupu Road was cut off twice on February 2nd and 3rd. 5. Qinyu Company's water to houses numbered 5 to 137 in Qinyu Li on Linqing Road in Yangshupu, was a packaged-water arrangement, and the total cost for July to December was 436.65 yuan. On January 17th, an immediate bank check was sent, but the company returned it and refused to accept it. The water was cut off on February 3rd. The tenants reopened it themselves. The company then closed it again and sent people to guard it. The tenants still freely turned on the water. 6. The water to Jinyang Li on Beidier Road in Yangshupu, represented by China Business Company, was cut off by the water company at 9:30 AM on February 1st.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Negotiation Process <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, Dou Yaoting, a member of the standing committee of the Real Estate Association, along with Mr. and Mrs. Plosserden and Mr. Spike, the chairmen of the Western Property Owners Association, went to the Public Works Department and met with Secretary Jones. Dou and others explained that after the water company installed the main water meter, the water fees had skyrocketed. They pointed out that the water company's water price had already increased to 7.5%, so there was no need to worry about the company losing money. The company's revenue had greatly increased since the actual delivery. On the other hand, the landlords had suffered a great loss. The water cutoff issue had now reached a serious state in the city. As the highest administrative body in the concession, the Public Works Department should pay attention to it. The Secretary asked for the specific opinions of the property owners. Dou explained that the memorandum submitted to the Public Works Department the other day was the opinion of the property owners. At that time, the Secretary replied that the case had been submitted to the Public Works Committee for discussion this afternoon (6th), and that a reply would be given as soon as the results were available, stating that the installation of water meters by the Water Company was imperative, but that another method would be used in the future so that property owners would not suffer significant losses. After speaking, Dou and others left.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Mr. Feng's Opinion <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of universally installing water meters, Feng Bingnan has been actively mediating. Our reporter obtained Mr. Feng's suggestions in a written statement to the Public Works Department, which are translated as follows: ("Mr. Feng Bingnan's Opinion on the Issue of Universal Water Meter Installation" - Abridged Translation of Mr. Feng's Letter to the Public Works Department, December 5, 1932). Since the water meter contract was signed between the Public Works Department and the Shanghai Waterworks Company on December 24, 1931, the Waterworks Company has been installing water meters within the settlement. Since the trial use of metered water billing began, water bills have sharply increased, with some even quadrupling or ninefold the original cost. As it is customary in Shanghai for water fees to be included in the rent and collected by landlords on behalf of the company, the increased water fees primarily affect landlords. The Real Estate Association has risen in opposition, and negotiations have been protracted without resolution. Currently, landlords and the company find it difficult to reach an agreement. Prior to the twelfth year [of the Republic], officials of the Public Works Department foresaw this issue. The Chief Officer at the time drafted a memorandum stating, "Water meter prices should be graded so that after meter installation, the water price paid by users will not be higher than the packaged water system. As for Chinese-style houses, due to Shanghai's customs, fees are paid by landlords. Therefore, legal protection should be provided to prevent tenants from wasting water to protect the interests of landlords." His intention was, "The company should first select fifty households for trial meter installation to test the average water consumption and then determine the value of the water meter accordingly." Metered billing means the monthly fees fluctuate, with no fixed amount compared to the previous month. However, rent is fixed monthly and cannot increase or decrease with water prices. This is obvious. Furthermore, landlords cannot restrict tenants' water usage. Due to these two reasons, the Real Estate Association strongly opposes the Waterworks Company's plan to universally install water meters. The Chief of the Public Works Department of the Public Works Bureau stated at the Public Works Committee meeting on November 16, 1931, "Due to the current Shanghai custom, water fees are paid directly by landlords, not tenants. Therefore, it is difficult to predict whether installing water meters will achieve the goal of saving expenses." Therefore, unless users become direct payers, there will inevitably be a day when rental income is insufficient to cover water fees. Mr. Hill also only conditionally approved of universally installing water meters. Summarizing Mr. Hill's opinion, it stated that if Shanghai and American cities had identical customs and systems, universal water meter installation would be as effective in preventing waste as it is in American cities. However, if Shanghai has customs not found in America, the effectiveness of universal water meter installation compared to American cities becomes questionable. Regarding water meter prices, the contract between the Public Works Department and the Waterworks Company stipulates they are too high and not based on actual field testing. The Waterworks Company has discounts for users billed by meter, indicating the company also recognizes its prices are expensive. Mr. Hill believed water meter prices should not increase the burden on poor users, but those in charge ignored this. Furthermore, if Chinese-style properties are rebuilt, new landlords will inevitably demand the company install meters for each household according to the new contract schedule, requiring tenants to pay directly. The purchase price of these water meters and their maintenance costs will undoubtedly increase the social burden. It is true that water meters have been installed in Zhabei, the South, and the French Concession, but the situation is very different from the Public Settlement. In the other three areas, the packaged water system has not been in place for as long as it has in the Public Settlement. Furthermore, the other three companies would be unable to maintain balanced income and expenses without using the water meter system. The Public Settlement Waterworks Company has been highly profitable since its inception, enough to pay statutory dividends and more. Therefore, there is no need to specifically switch to the water meter system to cover expenses. The Waterworks Company's capital is in gold pounds, so there are insufficient dividends due to the excessive difference in the gold-silver exchange rate. However, whether the company can increase monthly prices because of this is questionable. The Public Works Department or society cannot force the company to change its gold capital to silver. Only shareholders have the right to decide this. This type of change would undoubtedly benefit users. Based on the above, revising water meter prices or setting graded price lists is insufficient to resolve this issue. The best solution is to give landlords and tenants one year to revise their contractual relationships so tenants become direct payers. During this year, old water prices should continue to apply. Once the habit of users paying directly is established, the meter installation fee per household, which is a major expense, should not be overlooked and should be carefully considered.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Letter to Tenants <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The Real Estate Association believes the Waterworks Company's installation of master meters directly increases landlords' expenses, which will inevitably increase tenants' burdens. Their announcement is as follows: Tenant water usage should originally be paid for by tenants themselves. It is only for convenience that it is customary for landlords to collect and pay water fees within the rent. Originally, water fees only accounted for 5% of the rent, later increasing to 6%. In the nineteenth year of the Republic [1930], the British-owned Shanghai Waterworks Company demanded an additional 25% payment. The Shanghai Real Estate Association actively opposed this increase in water fees, as it directly increases landlords' expenses and inevitably increases tenants' burdens. This effort did not achieve its goal of cancellation. Our [waterworks] company uses water meters to calculate water fees, resulting in much higher fees than before, with some increasing up to ninefold. For example, with a monthly rent, the water fee was previously calculated at 7.5% of the rent, requiring only $1.50 per month. Now, calculated by meter, the water fee is $13.50 per month. Considering that tenants previously paid only $1.50 for water, they now have to pay $13.50. Thus, for a monthly rent of $20, in addition to the original water fee of $1.50, an additional $12 water fee must be paid. It is illogical and impractical for landlords to pay this water fee on behalf of tenants. The Shanghai Real Estate Association is actively opposing this, but the Waterworks Company insists on implementation and even threatens to cut off water. Landlords have advocated for tenants for a long time without success and can only explain to tenants that if tenants are willing to increase water fees, landlords should deduct the water fees collected within the rent, leaving tenants to manage it directly. If they are unwilling to increase water fees, they should work together to find a solution. Otherwise, landlords have no power to prevent the Waterworks Company from cutting off water and even less power to pay water fees on behalf of tenants because landlords must fully pay the Waterworks Company the water fees collected within the rent. This announcement is hereby issued for the public's information.</p>

In addition to the Academia Sinica in Shanghai holding an exhibition of collected items on the 18th of this month, Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo and Minister of Finance Song Ziwen have consulted and decided that the Ministry of Finance will allocate $250,000 to send personnel to the United States for active preparations. The preparatory committee has resolved in a meeting to send personnel to Chicago this month for arrangements and simultaneously remit the funds. Currently, the Chicago side is temporarily being handled by the Chinese Consul General in Chicago.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, Gu Zhutong arrived in Shanghai from Zhen yesterday morning. At 10:30 AM, he went to Qiqi Road to visit President Song of the Executive Yuan, personally presenting the details of the Liu Yun-sheng execution case. He left after two hours. Gu has been extremely passive recently due to the Liu case being impeached by the Control Yuan and facing criticism from all sides. It was rumored that Gu was resigning. Our reporter inquired about this matter with Secretary-General Chu of the Executive Yuan yesterday (Chu was also present when Gu visited President Song). Mr. Chu did not deny it.</p>

<h3 id="e111">Yang Xingfo Explains the Anti-Imperialist League <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>And States the Situation of Inspecting Prisons in Beiping. According to a telegram from the National News Agency in Paris yesterday, the Non-War Association, organized by world celebrities, will form an investigation team to come to China to investigate the Northeast. Madame Sun Yat-sen, Soong Ching-ling, has already sent a telegram to welcome them. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency went to the Academia Sinica yesterday to meet with Vice President Yang Xingfo to inquire about the details and discuss the situation of inspecting prisons in Beiping.</p>
<p>Anti-Imperialist League According to Mr. Yang, the organization is actually named "Anti-Imperialist League." Madame Sun Yat-sen is one of the honorary presidents of the league. Participating countries include European, American, Chinese, and Indian nations. The major components include the Socialist Party and the Labour Party, mostly from the left-leaning side. All are world-renowned writers and scientists, holding significant positions and power. However, their names cannot be announced yet. Their purpose is to oppose any country's use of force to invade other countries, such as Japan's violent invasion of our Northeast. In particular, it is to oppose the alliance of imperialists to oppress weak countries. Therefore, during the January 28th Shanghai Incident, the league issued a lengthy statement condemning Japan's actions. However, our country did not disclose it at the time because it had not been translated. Recently, the league held an important meeting to discuss the "Non-Invasion of China Issue." Because the Lytton Commission report was produced by the hands of an imperialist group and contained many inaccuracies, they decided to form their own investigation team to come to China for investigation and compile another report to inform the world of the true situation. However, the date of their arrival in China is not known because their telegram has not been received. Madame Sun and others are preparing to receive them at that time.</p>
<p>The Process of Investigating Prisons Mr. Yang's inspection of prisons in Beiping was his first time. The results included the investigation of the Army Prison, the Military Branch's Reflection Center, and the Military Law Enforcement Detention Center. The Court Prison and the Public Security Bureau Detention Center were not investigated. There were over 150 detainees in these three prisons, mostly young students. After talking to them separately, it was found that only Han Linfu, the former communist believed to be dead, was around 40 years old. This person held a central position during the period of cooperation with the communists. The rest were around 20 to 30 years old. Half of them were detained due to communist suspicions during the separation of communists, and half were detained due to their relationship with the Revolutionary Relief Society. Among them, there was a girl, only 18 years old, also detained. In addition, there was one person with special circumstances. The prison buildings were converted from factories due to economic constraints. They were crude and simple, with 16 people in one room, which was extremely unsanitary. Compared to the model prisons, they were worlds apart and urgently needed improvement. Future investigations have not been decided yet, but experts will be invited to join the investigation in the future.</p>
<p>Reasons for Obstructing Ancient Artifacts Continuing, he said that the 120 boxes of ancient artifacts transported from the Academia Sinica to Shanghai were different from the ancient artifacts of the Palace Museum. The ancient artifacts of the Academia Sinica were turtle shells, pottery shards, and bronzes, excavated from the soil in Zhengzhou. Most of them were incomplete and only used for historical research. The southward transport of the ancient artifacts of the Palace Museum was originally to avoid danger. People in Beiping believed that these ancient artifacts were essential for the prosperity of Beiping. Once removed, it would be affected. Therefore, they strongly opposed it. After boxing them up, the porters and rickshaw pullers refused to transport them for fear of being blamed by the locals, leading to obstruction. As for the rumors of selling ancient artifacts, it was another form of propaganda. Therefore, in the end, the people of Beiping hoped that after the dangerous period passed, they would still be transported back to Beiping for preservation. After Yi Peiji and others inquired to President Song, Mr. Song replied by telegram, promising to transport them back to Beiping when the city was stable. It is hoped that this telegram will prevent obstruction. This is the general situation I know.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Legislative Member Deng Zhexi Discusses Feng Yuxiang's Recent Attitude <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Legislative member Deng Zhexi and Third Route Army representative Tang Focai came to Shanghai. Our reporter believes that since Mr. Deng and others recently came south from Zhangjiakou, they will be able to provide a very detailed introduction of Feng Yuxiang's recent attitude. Yesterday, we drove to visit them and had a brief conversation. According to Mr. Deng, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek previously sent Wang Lizhai to Zhangjiakou to verbally urge Feng to immediately go to Nanjing to face the national crisis together. Feng said that if the central government is determined to resist Japan to the end, then he is willing to go to Nanjing immediately to participate in the work and do his part as a citizen, without needing any titles or positions. Otherwise, there is no need to go to Nanjing. He also said that Feng has been very active in Zhangjiakou in the anti-Japanese work, such as donating leather jackets to the volunteer army.</p>
<h3 id="e113">The Ministry of Railways' Land Grab Plan Remains Unchanged; Villagers Request Reconsideration Again <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways is grabbing land in the Pengpu area to build a joint transportation station. The villagers of Wangjiajing, Zhuxiang, Zhaojia Garden, and other villages in the area have repeatedly requested to find a way to avoid this. After consultations among the Ministries of Interior, Industry, Railways, and Military Affairs, the original plan remains unchanged. The villagers of the area submitted another petition to the Executive Yuan yesterday, requesting reconsideration. The document stated, "Submitting this to request reconsideration of the land grab for the joint transportation station because the decision of the four ministries' consultation is still unfair. According to reports in the Shanghai newspaper, the land grab issue for the joint transportation station between the Zhenru and Pengpu areas has been decided by a meeting of the Ministries of Interior, Military Affairs, Industry, and Railways, and the original plan of the Ministry of Railways will be carried out. Building a station in the Pengpu area is impractical and does not conform to general academic theory. We have already prepared detailed reports and illustrations to request to avoid this. Unexpectedly, this time the ministries' meeting did not change the plan and did not consider the actual situation and the hardships of the people. National construction cannot be based solely on the perspective of the authorities and become an arbitrary iron case. This is one reason why we should adopt academic theory and facts for reconsideration. The people have repeatedly detailed the suffering after the land grab and the reasons why the station should be built between the existing Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways. Whether the points presented can be adopted, whether the four ministries discussed them, and what the reasons are for the meeting's results remaining the original plan have not been clearly announced or answered. This is the second reason why we should follow the people's will and reconsider. The Zhenru area has ceded over 1,400 mu of open space, and the Pengpu area has added over 700 mu of village households. Where is the sufficient reason for ceding on one side and adding on the other? The Ministry of Railways has never clearly indicated this. This is the third reason why we should carefully consider and reconsider. The Ministry of Railways said that the joint transportation station occupies an area of 2,800 mu, but the staked boundary reaches over 4,000 mu. How will the remaining land be disposed of? This has not been clearly announced. This is the fourth reason why we should plan in detail and reconsider. Based on the above reasons, we dare to submit this document again to request review, order the relevant ministries to conduct a thorough reconsideration, and provide a satisfactory answer to each of the points presented. Otherwise, this concerns the lives and property of the people, and we vow not to recognize it. This urgent plea is submitted to Acting President of the Executive Yuan Song."</p>

<h3 id="e115">The Central Government Approves Shanghai's Collection of Land Value Tax <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The Date of Collection Has Not Been Determined Yet</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, regarding the city's collection of land tax, Secretary-General Yu Hongjun of the municipal government issued a statement yesterday stating that the city originally planned to collect land tax this year. Last year, the Finance and Land Bureaus jointly discussed the collection methods. After the implementation of this tax revenue, the city's finances will be greatly enriched. However, after the two bureaus agreed on the collection methods, the municipal government submitted them to the central government for approval and instructed the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Interior to review and report back. The central government instructed the municipal government that the collection methods have been approved. However, the name will not be land tax in the future, but land value tax. As for the date to start collecting, it has not been determined yet.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Xu Peihuang Discusses the Results of the Meeting on Power Supply in Western Shanghai <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The Signing of the Cross-Border Telephone Contract is Still Pending. Xu Peihuang, Director of the Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau, attended a meeting in Beijing on the 1st of this month due to the power supply issue in western Shanghai and returned to Shanghai last Friday. Our reporter met Mr. Xu at the municipal government yesterday and was informed of the results of the discussion and the cross-border road construction telephone issues, as follows:</p>
<p>Power Supply Issue According to him, the issue of the business rights for power supply in western Shanghai has been pending for a long time. The Public Utilities Bureau and the concession power company are still constantly discussing it. The principles have also been decided before. The Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Industry, and the Construction Committee all felt that some principles were not appropriate, so they discussed them again on the 1st of this month. I also attended the meeting in Beijing. The principles have been largely decided as a result of the meeting. The main points of the content will not be announced temporarily because it is not yet the time for public announcement. If it is deemed necessary in the future, relevant agencies will continue to meet together. The Public Utilities Bureau will still be responsible for discussing the implementation methods with the concession. This issue is related to a large amount of content, so it may not be resolved in a short time.</p>
<p>Cross-Border Telephone The telephone business rights for cross-border road construction are still being blocked by the French Public Works Bureau on one hand and still need to be reviewed and studied by the Public Settlement authorities on the other. Signing may still be pending. However, my personal opinion is that since the convenience of residents is the focus, the focus of research should also be based on the premise of facilitating residents. If it is repeatedly delayed for a long time, then the convenience for residents will be inconvenient, which is quite inappropriate. Therefore, I hope that foreign businessmen will abandon their profit-making goals, and the resolution will be easy.</p>

<p>The Northeastern Volunteer Army Support Association received a telegram from Geng Jizhou yesterday, replacing its representative in Shanghai. "To whom it may concern, Jizhou previously sent Yang Yijie and Cao Fengchun to the south to beg for support because there was no continuation of support. Unexpectedly, after Yang returned to Beiping, he left his post privately and secretly went south to engage in sabotage. Jizhou has already instructed Cao Fengchun to report in Shanghai that all of Yang's actions are unrelated to our army. Now, I have learned that the rear area is undecided about their trust in Jizhou's representative, so I have specially sent my son Chongde south to investigate and explain all misunderstandings. Please give him contact and instructions. I am very eager for this. Respectfully to the Northeastern Volunteer Army Support Association, Geng Jizhou."</p>

<p>The Shanghai County Finance Bureau, due to the expiration of the two-month deadline for the winter grain tax collection in the twenty-first year [of the Republic] and the low collection rate, immediately submitted a request to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance to extend the deadline to alleviate the difficulties of the people. The bureau received instructions from the Department of Finance yesterday, approving a 20-day extension. Director Wang immediately issued a notice to the county's business owners to pay the tax at the counter from January 25th to February 14th without incurring late fees. The two extensions last year and this year deeply sympathize with the people's plight, and the situation is special. This will not be used as an example in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Bandits Attempt Robbery and Open Fire on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Bandit Li Shunfa Escapes but is Recaptured</p>
<p>Soldier Wu Nairu Sacrifices His Life in the Line of Duty</p>
<p>At the 31st bridge on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway between Songjiang and Shihudang, there is a sentry post of soldiers from the 12th Company of the 3rd Battalion of the 2nd Regiment of the Jiangsu Security Force (the regimental headquarters is stationed in Songjiang). On the night before last (the 5th), around 6:00 PM, soldier Wu Nairu of the bridge sentry post apprehended a bandit and confiscated a short gun converted from a rifle and a row of bullets. Unexpectedly, around 11:00 PM that night, a large gang of more than 20 bandits suddenly arrived and opened fire on the bridge sentry post, intending to rob it and rescue the captured bandit. Both sides exchanged fire as if facing a major enemy. After about 15 minutes, the bandits, unable to withstand the pressure, fled, fatally wounding security force soldier Wu Nairu. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Black-Clad Vanguard: The sentry post of soldiers from the 3rd Battalion of the 2nd Regiment of the Security Force at the 31st bridge on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway between Songjiang and Shihudang, consisting of about 11 soldiers, was approached by a man dressed in short black clothes around 6:00 PM on the (5th). His appearance was suspicious, and he headed straight for the 31st bridge. Sentry Wu Nairu spotted him and immediately intercepted him with his gun, inspecting him. He found a short gun converted from a rifle and a row of bullets concealed on the man's body. The bandit did not resist and was immediately apprehended and taken to the sentry post under the bridge for temporary detention, intending to be sent to the Songjiang regimental headquarters for interrogation the next morning. The bandit was taken to the sentry post and briefly interrogated by the platoon leader. The bandit confessed to the name Li Shunfa, age 28, from Ningbo, and admitted without hesitation to conspiring with a gang to commit robbery. Due to the lateness of the hour, he was not sent to the Songjiang regimental headquarters but was temporarily bound with hemp rope and detained. Attempt to Seize the Bandit Leader: Unexpectedly, around 11:00 PM that night, about 120 meters west of the bridge, a large gang of more than 20 bandits was suddenly discovered. They lined up and opened fire on the bridge sentry post, as if facing a major enemy, intending to rescue the captured bandit leader, Li Shunfa. At that time, all the soldiers at the bridge sentry post fought back bravely. Both sides exchanged fire for about 15 minutes. As a result, the bandits were unable to withstand the pressure and fled. However, bridge guard soldier Wu Nairu was shot in the right chest by the bandits and died on the spot.</p>
<p>Biting the Rope and Jumping into the River: Li Shunfa, the detained bandit, took advantage of the firefight to bite through the rope binding him with his teeth and escaped. He jumped into the river to flee, but was spotted by the sentry, who wounded him in the head and recaptured him. He was taken back to the sentry post for detention.</p>
<p>A Suspect: Around 5:00 AM on the morning of the (6th), the bridge sentry was searching in the vicinity and apprehended a suspect. The suspect confessed to the name Wu Chengjun, age 34, from Anhui, wearing a gray cloth military uniform. He claimed to be a discharged soldier who, lacking travel expenses, planned to walk along the railway line to Shanghai to return home. The sentry immediately sent the wounded bandit Li Shunfa and the suspect Wu Chengjun to the Songjiang Second Security Regiment headquarters for interrogation yesterday morning at 7:00 AM. Meanwhile, soldier Wu Nairu, who was shot and killed by the bandits, was prepared for burial in a coffin.</p>
<p>Military Police Deployed: Police Chief Wang of the South Station Police Team of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, based on a report from the Shihudang Railway Police, immediately dispatched nearby railway police to assist the bridge sentry in rounding up the bandits. He also led senior police officers and inspectors to investigate the scene to report to the two railway police departments for investigation. The bridges along the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway line are vital to transportation and are of utmost importance. The fact that these bandits dared to be so rampant is indeed disruptive to travelers. After investigation, the 31st bridge is guarded by a sentry post of soldiers from the 12th Company of the 3rd Battalion of the 2nd Regiment of the Jiangsu Security Force, and the 34th bridge is currently guarded by two water police patrol boats. However, the remaining 30th, 38th, and 43rd bridges, as well as the Shihudang area, have no military presence, only railway police patrolling. The police force is weak. The railway police chief has not only dispatched additional railway police to guard these bridges but has also sent a letter from the railway bureau to the military units stationed in each area, requesting them to dispatch troops to guard them in order to strengthen the force and ensure transportation.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Public Concession Plans to Implement Mandatory Registration of Doctors <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The Public Concession's Municipal Council has been deliberating for years on the mandatory registration of practicing physicians in the concession. In 1925, based on the report of the Poison Investigation Committee, the Health Department formally recommended this matter. However, as the Municipal Council did not yet have the legislative power for this mandatory registration, it was not immediately implemented. However, to protect the public and gradually eliminate unqualified doctors, a voluntary registration system was established in 1931 under the supervision of the Shanghai Medical Committee. The names, qualifications, nationalities, etc., of voluntarily registered physicians, dentists, and veterinarians were compiled into a register and published. This register has been published twice, in August 1931 and July 1932. The third edition of the register is currently being printed, which includes 606 physicians, 115 dentists, 14 veterinarians, and 33 traditional Chinese medicine practitioners. Those listed in the register are registered doctors recognized by the Shanghai Medical Committee. Recently, public opinion has held that the implementation of mandatory registration cannot be delayed any further. The last Shanghai Medical Committee meeting resolved to request the Municipal Council to proceed with this matter as soon as possible. The majority of members believe that without mandatory registration, the malpractice of incompetent doctors and the rampant advertising, etc., cannot be dealt with. Furthermore, given that the Shanghai Municipal Government and the French Concession both have mandatory registration measures, the Public Concession cannot delay any longer. The Municipal Council's Health Committee has expressed its approval in principle of this proposal and will soon submit it to the Board of Directors for a decision. Many taxpayers have also submitted opinion letters on this matter.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Two Robbers and Murderers Sentenced to Death <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Wang Zhongde and Sun Lianfu Both Sentenced to Death</p>
<p>Han Sen Sentenced to Fourteen Years of Imprisonment</p>
<p>Wang Zhongde, also known as Chun Si, age 33, from Anhui, became acquainted with the wife of a friend, surnamed Yao, the year before last winter. Later, during the war in Zhabei, he colluded with a fellow villager named Little Liu to secretly assassinate Yao. Afterwards, Little Liu frequently demanded money from Wang for expenses. On the evening of July 20th last year, around 9:00 PM, Wang, deeply resenting him, entrusted Sun Lianfu (also known as Little Lianfu), age 19, and Han Sen (also known as Little Lao Han) to each carry a handgun to the entrance of Jixiang Lane on Yulin Road. Taking advantage of Little Liu sleeping on a canvas chair enjoying the cool air, they shot him in the head, killing him. After the incident, Wang and the other three were successively apprehended by Chinese Detective Lu Gengsheng of the Yulin Road Police Station. It was found that Sun Lianfu and Han Sen had, between June 6th and July 19th last year, formed a gang and used weapons to rob Chen Guozhi at No. 60 Fenzhou Road and Chen Qingsong at No. 342 Yangzhou Road, among other two households' property. A handgun and seven bullets were also seized from the house at No. 41 Qiwupu Road, and together with the suspect Ouyang Shilong, also from Anhui, they were handed over to the First Special District Local Court. After repeated investigations, a date was set for the pronouncement of the verdict, the details of which have been reported in the newspapers. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Zehan took the bench in the Third Criminal Court and announced the verdict. The defendant Wang Zhongde (aka Chun Si) was sentenced to death for the crime of jointly premeditating murder, with permanent deprivation of civil rights. Sun Lianfu (aka Little Lianfu) was sentenced to death for the crime of jointly premeditating murder, with permanent deprivation of civil rights, and sentenced to seven years of imprisonment for the crime of armed robbery by a gang of three or more people. The death sentence was to be executed. Han Sen (aka Little Lao Han) was sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment for the crime of aiding and abetting premeditated murder, with ten years of deprivation of civil rights, and sentenced to seven years of imprisonment for the crime of armed robbery by a gang of three or more people, to be executed for fourteen years, with ten years of deprivation of civil rights. The number of days of pre-trial detention was to be counted as two days for one day. Ouyang Shilong was sentenced to a fine of one hundred yuan for the crime of privately possessing military firearms and ammunition. If unable to pay the fine, he would serve one day of imprisonment for every two yuan. The firearms and ammunition were confiscated.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Thugs and Local Bullies Impersonate Detectives to Investigate Cigarettes <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Taking Advantage of the Opportunity to Extort Money and Commit All Kinds of Evil Deeds</p>
<p>Several Cases Have Been Verified</p>
<p>In recent years, the Public Concession authorities have been strictly cracking down on the cigarette ban within the concession. This anti-smoking work is all handled by the specially established Narcotics Division. Since its establishment, it has achieved remarkable results. Therefore, regardless of the size of the smoking case, such as private trafficking of opium, setting up smoking dens, etc., there is hardly a day without it in the First Special Court. However, there is a group of unemployed thugs who take advantage of this time to impersonate detectives from the Narcotics Division, etc., to extort money from residents within the concession. There are several cases of victims every day. Recently, the Narcotics Division learned of this and conducted a thorough investigation. On the 16th of last month, they apprehended the criminals Zhang Shunchang, Xu Yuangui, Lu Ronggui, and Wu Shiqing, who were extorting money under this pretense, in Room 20 of the Aido Hotel on Aidoa Road. Letters, flashlights, batteries, and other items were seized. They were handed over to the First Special District Court for questioning. Because the police were investigating, the discussion was changed to a later date. This has been reported in this newspaper. Now, Song Bingzheng, Chen Yaoting, and West Detective Mai Fei, who are handling this case in the Narcotics Division, have found that the defendants have committed nine cases of extorting silver dollars from residents in the concession under the guise of police detectives from November of last year to the time of their arrest this year. 1) On January 6th of this year, they extorted 20 yuan from the Xu Jianquan family at No. 563 Pike Road under the pretext of searching for opium. 2) On November 19th of last year, they extorted 80 yuan from Li Mei at No. 129 Back Road. 3) On November 20th of last year, they extorted 5 yuan from Du Quefeng at No. 14 Xinzha Road. 4) On December 25th of last year, they extorted 10 yuan from Wang Li at No. 137 Back Road. 5) On November 20th of last year, they extorted 50 yuan from Qian Wu at No. 8 Xinping Lane, Longmen Road. 6) On November 13th of last year, they extorted 200 yuan from Jing Shiyuan at No. 954 Broadway Road. 7) On December 30th of last year, they extorted 75 yuan from Wang Yuzhang at No. 93 Fujian Road. 8) On November 28th of last year, they extorted 300 yuan from Fei Lianshi and Xu Chunchu at No. 276 Shandong Road. 9) On November 20th of last year, they extorted 50 yuan from Zhang Liu at No. 64 Shandong Road. Yesterday morning, they were handed over to the Second Criminal Court of the Special Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang requested a special hearing at a later date due to the large number of witnesses in this case. Judge Qian Wenqi approved the request and ordered that the case be heard again tomorrow afternoon (i.e., today). In addition, the Narcotics Division recently apprehended a criminal named Fan Debiao and seized a pair of handcuffs, which were brought to the police station. It was found that Fan was also one of the gang of thugs who extorted money. On September 25th of last year, he broke into the house of Chen Heshang, a resident at No. 142 Shanxi Road, claiming to be a detective sent by the police to investigate opium. He found smoking paraphernalia and, as a result, extorted 4 yuan. Therefore, Chen Heshang was summoned to testify against Fan Debiao yesterday morning and handed over to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. According to police lawyer Wang Yaotang's statement of the case, there have been many cases of impersonating detectives to extort money recently, which has made it difficult for Narcotics Division detectives to handle cases. He requested that the defendant be severely punished to deter others from following suit. According to Chen Heshang's testimony, Fan Debiao's confession was evasive, and he hired lawyer Li Fengshen to defend him in court. Judge Qian verified the confession and sentenced Fan Debiao to four months of imprisonment for the crime of extortion.</p>
<h3 id="e125">An Old Thief, With No Hope of Getting Out of Prison, Resorts to His Old Tricks the Day After His Release <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The Number of Theft Cases Committed in His Life is Countless</p>
<p>He Has Been Apprehended and Punished Fifteen Times</p>
<p>Around 2:00 AM on the morning of the day before yesterday, the residence of a Westerner, Hai Qiawan, at No. 257 Columbia Road in West Shanghai, was visited by a thief who pried open the door and entered. As Mr. Hai was out at the time, the thief was able to go upstairs and into the room, stealing gold and silver utensils worth 530 yuan and carrying the loot out. But feeling unsatisfied, he hid the stolen goods in a nearby wasteland and returned to Mr. Hai's bedroom, intending to steal other items. Just then, Mr. Hai returned home and saw a dark figure in the room. He shouted, "Who is there?" But received no answer. Realizing it was a criminal, he was about to arrest him when the thief jumped out of the window and fled. Mr. Hai drew his own handgun and fired three shots, but missed. The thief managed to escape with the loot. Mr. Hai reported the incident to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which notified all police stations to be on the lookout. Unfortunately, the thief's luck ran out. While carrying the loot and passing through the intersection of Zhapu Road and Tiantong Road in Hongkou around 9:00 AM, he was spotted by a Chinese constable from No. 618 Police Station, who apprehended him. When questioned about the origin of the items in his bag, he confessed that they were stolen. He was taken to the police station and transferred to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. Chinese Detective Yang Xinzheng investigated and found his name to be Jiang Deming, a native of Shanghai, age 42 (also known as Lin Deren, Jiang Derun, Zhang Shisheng, and You Asheng). Stealing was his regular occupation. The number of theft cases he had committed in his life was countless. He had been apprehended and punished as many as fifteen times. This time, he had just been released from the Caohejing Prison in the interior on the 4th of this month, and on the 5th, he was arrested again for theft. He could be called an old thief. Yesterday morning, the police handed Jiang over to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated the above situation and requested that he be severely punished. The Westerner Hai Qiawan also sent a representative to the court to testify that all the items retrieved by the police were indeed the original stolen goods. When questioned, Jiang Deming bowed his head and remained silent. Judge Qian Wenqi verified the confession and sentenced Jiang Deming to two years of imprisonment for the crime of habitual theft. The stolen goods were to be returned to the original owner for collection.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Restoration of Wusong Telephone Service <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Work Started Yesterday</p>
<p>The Wusong telephone service has not been restored since the January 28th Incident. The original commercial Songyang Telephone Company was completely destroyed and suffered heavy losses, and has gone bankrupt. The Wusong municipal authorities and the Chamber of Commerce believe that the lack of telephone service in Songjiang for a long time not only hinders communication but also greatly affects local security. Therefore, they have repeatedly sent letters to the Shanghai Department of Transportation Telephone Bureau to handle the matter. The bureau already had a branch office on Guizi Road in Wusong, specializing in the Songjiang-Shanghai long-distance telephone line. It is now known that the bureau dispatched Engineer Xu yesterday, leading more than 20 workers and transporting a large amount of materials to Songjiang, to rush to erect poles and lines for the entire Wusong area. It is estimated that it will take three weeks to complete the work.</p>
<h3 id="e127">New Launch of the Seaport Quarantine Station Named Hua Tuo <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The Zi Lin Newspaper reports that the National Seaport Quarantine Station added a new motor launch today (the 6th), named Hua Tuo. The boat is 56 feet long, 11 feet wide, and 6 feet 9 inches deep, with a speed of 8 miles per hour. It is equipped with a Schneider-Diesel engine, between 55 and 65 horsepower, with three cylinders rotating 550 to 625 times per minute. This launch was originally intended to be assigned to the Wusongkou to pick up and drop off medical officers boarding and disembarking from ships. Now, due to the busy inspection work in the Huangpu River, the original launch is not sufficient, so it is temporarily used in the Huangpu River.</p>
<h3 id="e128">New Discovery of Radio <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Stove as Radio Receiver</p>
<p>On the north side of the upper floor of the Science Hall of the Jiangsu Provincial Education Institute in Wuxi, there is a radio broadcasting station. On the south side of the lower floor (separated by about six or seven feet), there is an agricultural laboratory with a stove inside. When broadcasting, a sound is emitted from the stove, and the sound is quite clear, like the small speaker of a third-class radio. A certain gentleman in the institute is currently studying it, and it is hoped that domestic experts will also study it together so that there may be inventions in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Qingpu Vessel Aground at Taizi Shoal <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Vessel Sends Telegraph Requesting Assistance: The river has been very shallow recently, and the retreat of the river near Taizi Shoal, Anqing, is even worse. The Sanbei Company's Fengpu vessel ran aground on the 26th of last month. The bureau dispatched a ship to tow it for three days before it was pulled out. It is currently coming from Datong with coal and has not yet arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday afternoon, the company received a telegram from the Qingpu vessel, stating that the ship, traveling east from Hankou, ran aground again on the Jiangmian of Taizi Shoal the night before last (i.e., the 5th) due to shallow water. The Qingpu was loaded with many goods and passengers, so the hull was trapped in the sand and mud, and the vessel could not move.</p>
<p>Awakened Lion's Rescue Ineffective: After the Qingpu vessel ran aground, it immediately sent a wireless telegram for help. The company's upstream Yangtze River vessel, the Awakened Lion, received the telegram and immediately sailed to tow it. When the Awakened Lion arrived at Taizi Shoal, the water was still shallow, and it could not get close to the Qingpu. It used an iron cable to connect to the Qingpu vessel, and the Awakened Lion tried its best to tow it. The Qingpu also reversed the engines, but as the Qingpu vessel was heavily loaded with cargo and the draft was deep, it was stuck firmly. The Awakened Lion's rescue was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Changxing Towing Barge to Tow: The only way to rescue it now is to unload part of the cargo from each cabin of the Qingpu to reduce the draft, and to transfer a batch of passengers first, and then tow it again when the tide rises. After discussion, the Qingpu shipowner telegraphed the Hankou branch to order the Changjiang downstream vessel, Changxing, to bring a towing barge and rush to Taizi Shoal to unload the Qingpu cargo in order to tow it. Hankou replied to Shanghai, approving the dispatch of the Changxing and towing barge to rescue it.</p>

The procedures for changing the name and customs vessel license have also been completed. It is scheduled to depart from Shanghai tomorrow evening (the 8th) with cargo and passengers, heading directly to Chongqing.</p>

<p>Yu Jinmao, 52 years old, from Shaoxing Yaoxian, has been running Hengde Coal Store at No. 175 Fuyou Road, inside the New North Gate of this city, for 22 years. Yu's wife, Shao, 48 years old, lives upstairs in the store. They have a son and a daughter. The eldest son, Weiliang, 24 years old, is a student at Guanghua University and is about to graduate this semester. He is married to Mao. The younger daughter, Xinggen, 19 years old, is studying at the Shanghai High School. Because Yu has been ill, Shao assists with the daily store business and also manages over thirty rental properties on Daxing Street, near the Small West Gate, collecting rent monthly. The couple works diligently and thriftily, and their business is doing well, with some savings accumulated. This has attracted the attention of thieves. At about 7:00 PM yesterday, just after Yu and his family finished dinner, five thieves, armed with two handguns and a dagger, broke into the store, brandished their weapons, and threatened them not to make a sound. They drove the shop owner and his family into a room to monitor their movements. The other robbers rushed upstairs and robbed them of 350 silver dollars, about 50 dollars' worth of copper coins, a gold watch, a gold pocket watch, three gold bracelets, a gold chain, and two gold rings. After the robbery, they took the stolen goods and fled out the door, escaping towards Zhangchuan Lane, inside the New North Gate. Shao immediately reported the incident to the patrol police at the Second Precinct of the First District. Meanwhile, Yu's daughter followed the thieves, tracking them to a dark alley next to Jishan Temple on Jishan Street. The thieves threatened her, so she dared not go further and stopped the pursuit, returning home. Afterwards, Precinct Chief Xu Chenghuang received the report and led police to surround and search the area, but the thieves had long since fled without a trace. The case was reported to the General Bureau for record and assistance in the investigation. Director Wen, upon receiving the report, sent personnel to investigate the scene and ordered the detective captain, Lu Yingxun, to have the stationed detectives inquire about clues from the victims. According to reports, the silver dollars were intended to pay for the children's tuition fees today. The daughter, knowing that her tuition fees had been robbed and that she might not be able to continue her studies, bravely pursued the robbers. However, the eldest son is near graduation, and it would be a pity for him to drop out. The entire family is dejected, a heartbreaking scene to witness.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Shanghai Public Safety Bureau Issues New Measures for Handling Transiting Refugees <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Orders Distributed to All Districts and Precincts Yesterday</p>
<p>Refugees from various regions come to Shanghai seeking food every day. Some cunning ones often return after being sent away, regarding fraudulently obtaining rations as a lucrative business. The Municipal Public Safety Bureau believes that if such situations are not strictly controlled, it will not only tarnish the city's image but also easily affect public safety. Therefore, it has formulated four measures for handling transiting refugees and distributed them to all districts and precincts yesterday. The original order and measures are as follows:</p>
<p>Order: Regarding the matter of issuing orders, this city is commercially prosperous and has convenient transportation. Refugees from various regions come here seeking food every day. Whenever refugees enter the city, the district or precinct in charge immediately telegrams the point of origin or directly informs the Social Affairs Bureau to transfer aid to charitable organizations for issuing rations. Then, the district or precinct in charge escorts them out of the city. However, there is a lack of communication between the parties, and there is no detailed registration of the refugees' entry and exit points for investigation. As a result, some refugees receive rations in Pudong in the morning and seek food in the South City in the evening, moving back and forth within Shanghai. This situation, where they are driven away from one place only to move to another, is endless. This can seriously affect public safety and, to a lesser extent, harm the city's image. Therefore, four measures for handling transiting refugees and a reporting form are hereby established. In addition to sending a letter to the Social Affairs Bureau to inform all charitable organizations that after rations are issued, they must notify this bureau for verification. Besides distributing this notice, the aforementioned measures and reporting form are attached and issued with this order. The district and precinct chiefs are ordered to strictly comply and implement them. This is of utmost importance. Respectfully, this order. February 6th, 1933, Director Wen Hongen.</p>
<p>Measures: 1. When refugees enter the city, the district or precinct in charge shall immediately telegram the bureau and quickly find a temporary residence address and send police to guard them, preventing them from moving freely or forcibly soliciting on the streets. Once a charitable organization issues rations, the district or precinct in charge shall immediately send police to escort them out of the city limits and quickly fill out a report form to be sent to the bureau for record. 2. If a district or precinct verifies, through the refugee's residence permit or other means, that the refugees have already received rations, they must be escorted out of the city. 3. If refugees must pass through the territory of another district or precinct when leaving the city, and it is deemed necessary to continue to send police, the district or precinct in charge may directly discuss the measures via telegram. The district or precinct in charge must not shirk responsibility or refuse to send police. 4. If it is found that any district or precinct intentionally delays, causing refugees to stay in their territory for a long time, the responsible officers of the district or precinct in charge will be severely punished. If it is found that any precinct performs well and has made meritorious contributions, the responsible department may submit a request for review and reward.</p>

<p>Objecting to Employers' Unjustified Dismissal of Employees</p>
<p>Several stores in the city's coal industry, including Yuansheng, dismissed dozens of employees, including Yu Zhicheng, during the Lunar New Year. The workers reported the matter to the labor union, which sent representatives to mediate, but to no avail. They immediately submitted a petition to the party and government agencies, requesting assistance. The Municipal Party Department sent representatives to mediate and decided that the stores should not expel the workers from the stores before a resolution is reached. The dismissed workers went to the stores the day before yesterday to await a resolution. However, Yuansheng Coal and Charcoal Company requested the Public Safety Bureau to send plainclothes detective Fang Chao to prevent this and detained seven people, including Yu Huifeng, director of the labor union, and Yu Zhicheng, the worker, at the Fourth District Public Safety Bureau. They were released because there were no charges against them. The workers were enraged, and yesterday they sent more than ten representatives, including Li Hua, Zheng Xiaotang, and Hu Chuchao, to the Municipal Party Department with a petition. Lu Yinchu, a staff member of the Civil Affairs Department, received them and, after inquiring about their intentions, promised to coordinate with the Social Affairs Bureau to mediate. They then went to the Social Affairs Bureau to make the same request, asking for practical assistance to maintain the workers' livelihoods.</p>

<p>The Tongru Chonghai Qi Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai, upon receiving news of the Lyusi Mutiny, convened a meeting of the Executive Supervisory Committee at the association's office at 2:00 PM yesterday. More than twenty committee members, including Mao Huiru, attended. Chairman Mao chaired the meeting. After discussing the Lyusi Mutiny, they decided to send telegrams to the province and county requesting them to send troops to suppress the mutiny and to send a letter to the Lyusi Chamber of Commerce inquiring about the details of the mutineers' looting and the extent of the damage, in order to properly discuss the aftermath. The original telegrams are recorded below:</p>
<p>To the Provincial Government: To Governor Gu, Chairman of the Zhenjiang Provincial Government, and to Zhao, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, and Han Jun, Director of the Security Department: The garrison guerrilla troops in the Lyusi District of Tong Prefecture suddenly mutinied on the 豔 day, looting both towns, causing great losses, killing three people including Chen Zhixi, and abducting many men and women, fleeing by sea. The news of the alarm has spread, and we are shocked. In recent years, Tong Prefecture has been repeatedly harassed by pirates and ravaged by bandits. The city is desolate, and the people's livelihoods are impoverished. The wounds are deep, and the pain is immense. Just when we were hoping to recuperate and breathe, unfortunately, a mutiny broke out in the heart of the land, causing another disaster. The suffering is unimaginable. These mutinying troops were originally pirates who were recruited and reorganized. Their ambitions are difficult to tame. Now that they have rebelled and become bandits, their ferocity is fully revealed. We believe that they should be completely suppressed and not allowed to flee far away. Otherwise, the troops will come and the bandits will go, and the bandits will come when the troops leave. The past of Pan Sang can serve as a warning. The people of this association in Shanghai are deeply concerned about their hometown and are filled with grief. We dare to telegram you, Your Excellency, requesting you to send capable naval vessels to the area and strictly order County Magistrate Zhang to supervise the local police force and jointly suppress the mutiny on land and sea. With the determination to eliminate evil, we seek a long-term solution and fundamentally eliminate the problem, preventing it from spreading. Please order County Magistrate Zhang to rescue and properly settle all the abducted people and affected households, so as to stabilize the local area and reassure the people. We anxiously await your orders. Tongru Chonghai Qi Fellow-Provincials Association respectfully bows. To County Magistrate Zhang, Nantong: To County Magistrate Zhang of Nantong, and to the Liaison Defense Office and the Security Committee: We have just learned that the garrison guerrilla troops in the Lyusi District suddenly mutinied, looting both towns, causing great losses, killing three people including Chen Fuzhixi, and abducting many men and women, fleeing by sea, and so on. The news of the alarm has spread, and we are shocked. In recent years, the county has been repeatedly harassed by bandits and pirates, causing deep wounds. The vitality has not yet recovered. Commerce is currently in a state of decline, and the countryside is facing bankruptcy. Just when the people are exhausted and hoping to recuperate and breathe, unexpectedly, a mutiny broke out in the heart of the land, causing another disaster. The suffering is unbearable. The people of this association in Shanghai are deeply concerned about their hometown and are filled with grief. We dare to telegram you, Your Excellency, requesting you to supervise the local police force and urgently dispatch land and naval forces to jointly suppress the mutiny. We also request you to consult with neighboring counties to strictly prevent and block the mutineers, ensuring that they are all wiped out and not allowed to flee and spread, so as to eliminate hidden dangers. Please investigate and rescue all the abducted people and affected households, so as to stabilize the local area and reassure the people. We anxiously await your prayers. Tongru Chonghai Qi Fellow-Provincials Association respectfully bows.</p>

<h3 id="e148">『Elopement』or『Suicide』? <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>丨A Letter from Mr. Hong Huaide丨</p>
<p>I read your newspaper's reader advisory column every day, and it has indirectly solved many of my problems. However, sometimes I have difficult issues of a different nature. I have repeatedly wanted to ask you, but I worry that your newspaper will think my ideas are immature and not answer me. Now I have a life-or-death problem. Please guide me, sir. I am twenty years old this year. Because of my family's poverty, I stopped attending school six years ago! I now work as a clerk in a small department store, and my monthly salary is meager, only enough for my personal expenses. When I was in elementary school before, there was a female classmate three years younger than me who was close to me. Later, her family moved to Jiangxi Province for a few years, so we both forgot about each other. By chance, last year they moved near my store. We met again after a long separation, and our feelings deepened. Sometimes I take time to chat with her in the countryside, and our love has gradually grown stronger. Our ambitions, ages, and appearances are quite compatible, but it is a pity that our family backgrounds are too different! She is the sixth young lady from a middle-class family, and I am a struggling young man with no clear future, with absolutely no one to rely on except myself. In the old-fashioned society, who doesn't see "raising a daughter to marry into a high-ranking family"? Her father will definitely not abandon the concept of marrying someone of equal social status and marry her to a struggling young man like me! Half a year ago, her parents had already betrothed her to a so-called young boss. She resisted desperately, but to no avail. As a result, she has become increasingly thin. I always try to comfort her. I am also disliked by the store owner, and I am forced by circumstances to distance myself from her! She was extremely angry and attempted suicide, intending to show her love for me. Fortunately, her family discovered it, and she was able to recover. As for me, I ask myself in the quiet night, and I really feel sorry for her dedication! I am determined to elope with her regardless, but firstly, it would violate the law, and secondly, it would implicate her father's reputation. After thinking it over, the only way out for us is suicide! Sir, you are experienced and knowledgeable, enough to shed light on my dark room. Besides death, is there any other solution?</p>
<p>Answer: After reading your letter, I cannot help but shed a tear of sympathy for you first. Your problem is a common problem for young people in modern society. Our newspaper's "advisory" service to readers is dedicated to providing sincere and intelligent advice.</p>
<p>As for the limited knowledge and experience of our colleagues, we will openly discuss and research. There is no shortage of enlightened and insightful people in the country, and they will surely be able to teach you. Your fear that we would not answer because of "immature thoughts" is indeed a misunderstanding. This is what we should solemnly declare to you before answering your letter. We have a basic concept regarding the relationship between men and women, which is that we express extreme sympathy for any relationship, including love, that is entirely built on the foundation of "mutual consent" and "mutual understanding." However, the so-called "mutual consent and mutual understanding" must have a necessary condition: that both parties must have a considerable period of mutual observation. During this observation period, both parties must use their reason, knowledge, and experience to analyze each other's temperament, habits, ability to earn a living, and plans for future cohabitation. Never act rashly based on temporary blind emotions: "Suicide" is definitely not the solution: "Elopement" is also not a good idea. Why? ㈠ Lack of freedom in marriage is an inevitable phenomenon in the current social system. Because of the lack of freedom in marriage, we should actively attack the society that makes it unfree, that is the mark of a hero. Suicide is a surrender and retreat to this unfree society. Although it is euphemistically called passive resistance, it is actually ending it all with death. Wouldn't that be laughed at by those who know better? Even if you die, it wouldn't count as a brave ghost, so we fundamentally oppose suicide. ㈡ "Elopement" is originally possible under the following conditions: (A) Both people have a very thorough understanding of the future and see that there are endless difficulties and dangers and vow to fight to the end: (B) Both people have considerable experience in society, so that they will not be at a loss as soon as they leave the door; (C) Both Yuan Cheng · Tao Mu · Huang Bodu · Shen Yu · Ji An · Ping · Li Zikuan · Jiang Ji Hu · Zu · both families, totaling more than a hundred people, after the wedding hosts from both sides gave speeches, the guests unanimously elected Xu Shiying to give a speech on behalf of them, and the wedding was concluded. The bridegroom is currently studying in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Jiaotong University, and the bride is a top student at Nanjing Huiwen Girls' Middle School. Mr. Zhai has lived in Suhu for generations, and he and Mr. Hu were comrades in adversity more than thirty years ago. During the Qing Dynasty's Guangxu years, Mr. Hu and Mr. Zhai jointly established agricultural reclamation in Wanqing Lake, using military methods to control farmers and tenants, in order to restore the old order. At that time, Su Manshu and Liu Guanghan taught at Anhui Public School, and Chen Duxiu founded Anhui Vernacular Newspaper at the Science Bookstore. They were all in communication. Mr. Zhai's eldest son, Yifu, has a master's degree in political science from the University of Chicago and was once a professor at Nankai University and the head of Jin County. He is currently an inspector at the Jiangsu Construction Department. The second son, Jinfu, has a doctorate in law from Northwestern University and currently works in the Legislative Yuan. Mr. Jinfu's wife, Ms. Cao Meien, also has a master's degree in education from Wittenberg University in the United States. Both are well-known in society.</p>

<p>People all have very good living skills, and they are very confident in their ability to find employment; "D" After the two leave, the mother's family will not use legal force to pursue them relentlessly. If they are indeed pursued relentlessly, what is a good way to resist them! Litigation if the above conditions are really met, elopement may not be impossible. In our view, this is probably not the case. First, your lover is a middle-class young lady, and you are a poor scholar. In the midst of this old social forces' siege, if you want to break through the net with this method, the result will be immediate failure. There is only one way: you and your lover should discuss it. The first step is for her to resolutely reject the other party's marriage proposal. The second step is to ask her parents for tuition fees to go out and study, and quickly prepare for independent living skills. On the other hand, you can also find a job where she studies. Since she has left her family and is prepared to have living skills, then who is there to fear interfering? The fundamental reason why people fear interference or are interfered with by their families is because they rely on the power that interferes with them. Moreover, your actions will definitely be more free during this time, and the two of you can also take this opportunity to calmly observe each other in every way, to see if you can truly be unwavering. If the situation changes and the two have different feelings, then you should set sail as early as possible and go your separate ways, so as not to deepen the relationship and increase your troubles. If you truly love each other with all your heart, then you can accomplish good things at the appropriate time, and that would be a complete success. Words from an outsider, offering a little advice, I hope you will think carefully about it.</p>

<p>Fudan Principal Agrees to Severely Punish the Offending Students</p>
<p>Apology to Mr. Chen and the Referee Association in Writing</p>
<p>Since the incident in December last year when Chen Jixiang, a member of the Chinese Sports Referees Association, was injured after being beaten while serving as a referee for a Jiangda football match, the sports community in Shanghai has been lamenting and seeing public service as a dangerous path. If the relevant authorities can truly use their authority to correct and protect such unfortunate events after they occur, it may not be impossible to lead the sports spirit back to the right track. After deliberation by the refereeing committee, Fudan authorities were instructed to implement an appropriate solution. Now, it is learned that Fudan University President Li Denghui has sent a special letter to Mr. Chen to apologize, bear medical expenses, and promise to thoroughly investigate the offending students and assign responsibility. It is anticipated that since the principal of the school has made this statement, he will definitely be able to effectively punish the offending students to comfort the refereeing committee and Mr. Chen. The original letter is reproduced below:</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Chen Jixiang, On the 18th of last month, there was an unfortunate incident of beating during a football match between Jiaotong and our school. Our school's Department of Physical Education Director Chen Bingde sent a letter of apology after the incident, which I hope you have seen. We have already thoroughly investigated the offending students, and two or three who were involved have been identified and punished. The leader is still under investigation. You are enthusiastic about sports, and were unreasonably insulted. Our school is deeply ashamed. Please let us know the total amount of medical expenses, which our school will bear. Sincerely, Li Denghui, Principal of Fudan University, January 14th,</p>
<h3 id="e161">A Message to the Youth of the Nation <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Jiang Hengyuan and Yang Weiyu of the China Vocational Education Society, and Liu Zhanen and Pan Wenan of the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Institute, have discovered that a large number of young people suffer from neurasthenia and recognize this as a great concern for the country. As the former German Chancellor Bismarck said, "If you see how your young people are, you can understand the future of your country." Every time I recite this, I cannot help but sigh deeply. Indeed, the composition of a country must be based on the youth as the main pillars. The rise and fall of a country's destiny depends on whether the youth are excellent or inferior. Is this not the reason? The Shanghai Vocational Guidance Institute, affiliated with the China Vocational Education Society, has hired health instructors to provide advice to young people who come to the institute. According to reports from the instructors, the most common illness among the young people who come for advice is neurasthenia, accounting for almost nine out of ten. If this is the case in one corner, it can be inferred elsewhere. The colleagues of our society and institute deeply feel that this issue is extremely serious, and dare to express their utmost sincerity to the beloved youth of our country.</p>
<p>A sound mind must reside in a sound body. The mind and body are inherently closely connected. Since the Qin Dynasty, China has emphasized literature over military affairs, which has become a common practice. Scholars despise physical education and do not emphasize vitality. Inherited from their ancestors, their physical condition is already weak. In this era of flourishing science and fierce economic competition, we cannot survive without being enterprising, and we cannot protect ourselves without striving. If we use this physical condition to compete with others, how can we not fail? As a result, our country's production is insufficient, the people's strength is declining, external disasters are urgent, and morale is declining, all of which have been clearly revealed. There are many reasons for this, but poor physical health is one of the main ones. Now, according to reports from the instructors, it has been discovered that the young people who are the main pillars of the country are in such an unfortunate condition. It is truly chilling. We cannot help but recognize that this is a great concern for the country. If we can take measures to save the situation as soon as possible, how can we not hope for the future of our nation?</p>
<p>I have often considered that the causes of neurasthenia are either due to excessive use of the brain, or due to improper sexual impulses and unrestrained indulgence. The former is related to school education, and the latter is related to the social environment, and the latter is even more important than the former. With the development of material civilization and the changes in male-female interaction, the trends are very different from the past. Young people's fragile minds are stimulated, and they chase after them arbitrarily, unable to stop themselves. As a result, they can only sink deeper and deeper. It must be known that desires have no limit to satisfaction, and indulgence is the medium of sin. The temptations of social demons are endless, and the shaking of individual hearts is also irresistible. Distress, depression, pessimism, and world-weariness arise one after another, which is inevitable. To study science diligently, work hard, serve society, and protect the country are all the great expectations that the people of the country have for today's youth, but the youth are already in such a state. Is there anything more heartbreaking in the world?</p>
<p>We colleagues, regarding the authorities of secondary schools, earnestly hope that they can pay close attention to the students' physical and mental health when implementing education. For leaders who bear the responsibility of maintaining morality in society, we earnestly hope that they can be cautious and not set bad examples for future generations. As for the young people who are currently in high school, university, or have graduated from high school or university, their blood and energy are about to be determined, and their knowledge is gradually increasing. We cannot help but have ten thousand wishes, hoping that they can achieve self-reliance through self-reflection.</p>
<p>The desire to improve is inherent in everyone. Material desires should be despised by young people. However, due to the temptation of the environment and the lack of advice, they unconsciously seek temporary pleasure and forget their ambitions. Young people, the boundary between humans and animals and the key to life and death, how can you not distinguish it? At this time, you should carefully compare the advantages and disadvantages and strengthen your determination, so as not to be affected by external things or shaken by external forces, so as to understand your own responsibilities. Have I not completed my studies, mastered my skills, established my character, or erased my shame? Can I be considered a human being? I say no. If not, what should I do? If my clothes are not as good as others, I can still avoid the cold. If my food is not as good as others, I can still avoid hunger. Am I still dissatisfied? Please look at those who are cold and have no clothes, those who are hungry and have no food. What will I do? Protect my body for the service of the country, and protect my country to fulfill my responsibilities. Since I have read books, I should understand this principle. If I do not know how to protect myself or my country, what is the use of reading books? All these things, I sincerely hope that my beloved youth will constantly reflect on themselves in order to achieve self-reliance. The country's heavy responsibility of ten thousand jun (a unit of weight) and the nation's long journey of ten thousand li (a unit of distance) all hope that you will carry it on your shoulders and walk it on your feet.</p>
<p>Do not be trapped by material things, do not indulge in sexual desires, protect your useful body, and diligently engage in reasonable exercise. This is truly the most important responsibility for young people to themselves and to the country. We colleagues truly cannot bear to blame the youth any further, but only sincerely and passionately ask our beloved youth to accept it.</p>
<p>Hengyuan still remembers last year when my friend Mr. Yang returned from Europe and told me what he had seen. One day, he visited a middle school at a German military base and saw fifty or sixty students practicing martial arts naked, with heat evaporating from their faces and backs. At that time, it was the dead of winter, and fine snow was falling in the sky. The visitors were wearing leather coats and still felt cold. After their class was over, they went forward and asked, "Are you not suffering?" Three of the students replied with emotion, "Sir, do you know that Germany has been disarmed? We have no guns to fight the enemy, so we can only forge our bodies into steel to fight them!" When I heard these words, I felt my nerves tremble. Alas, this is what is meant by German youth! How will the future of the German nation be? It can probably be seen from this. Beloved youth of our country, what will your thoughts be after seeing this?</p>
<p>The country is about to fall, and the time will not come again. Words have limits, but intentions are endless. May all the beloved youth of our country take heed of this.</p>

<p>Lin Baohua: Badminton is one of the most common competitions in the West and is even more popular in England. Overseas Chinese all practice it. Its fun may surpass tennis. One game of badminton is better than one set of tennis. However, in Shanghai, although it has become a common sport among Westerners, the Chinese are indifferent to it. Mr. Qiu's participation this time is intended to promote it. Since there is no venue for this kind of competition, there is no practice. I hope that the Chinese can be interested during the competition.</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai: Very few Chinese in Shanghai play badminton. In Hainan, such as Singapore, many people love it. This competition is indoors, so it is a very good sport for tennis players to practice their skills in winter. It is suitable for both men and women and is full of interest. I hope that the Chinese will start practicing it, organize clubs, prepare venues, compete with foreigners, and win the championship.</p>
<p>Competition Group Formation</p>
<p>The competition is sponsored by the Bu Hai Badminton Club. There are a total of five championships: men's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, women's singles, and mixed doubles. Ten people participate in the men's singles, eleven groups in the doubles, six people in the women's singles, eight groups in the women's doubles, and eleven groups in the mixed doubles. Since there are no Chinese participants in the women's singles, doubles, and mixed doubles, they are omitted. In the men's competition, Meiyeshi is hopeful for the singles championship. Mei was the champion in 1931. Last year, it was not held due to the Shanghai war. The doubles is also the strongest group with Meiyeshi and Beilunzi. Lin Baohua has the hope of reaching the semifinals against Beilunzi, but in the doubles, they will immediately face the veteran generals Xina and Xue Erfu, and I am afraid they must work hard to cope.</p>

<p>49 to 37, Western Youth Wins Over Tongji, 52 to 23 丨Two Group A Games Tonight丨</p>
<p>The Shanghai College and Zhenru basketball teams played a Group A match of the Shanghai Basketball Association last night at the Chinese Basketball Hall. The agile passing and wonderful shooting of both sides won continuous applause from the audience. It can be said to be the most exciting game of the Shanghai Basketball Association this season. As a result, Shanghai College won 49 to 37. In another Group A game, Western Youth defeated Tongji 52 to 23. In Group B, Qingxin defeated Zhengfeng 42 to 31, and Evening Star defeated Morning Team 51 to 16. There are only three games tonight. The schedule is as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e169">Shanghai College Defeats Zhenru <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai College Takes the Lead Right from the Start. Shanghai College used a feint to attack Zhenru directly. Two point guards, Sun Maiqing and Lu Hui, scored five points. Qian Jing罰 scored one point. Zhenru hurriedly defended, losing six points in a row, and then rushed to catch up. Huang Zhaolin used his sharpshooting skills to throw the basketball, catching up with five points.</p>
<p>Zhenru Gradually Reveals Its Edge. Qian Jing罰 added two points for Shanghai College, and Feng Nianhua罰 scored one point, leading 9 to 5. Zhenru did not show weakness, with a well-organized lineup, not flustered at all, pouncing in like a hungry tiger, brave and extraordinary. Huang Zhaolin and Wang Nanzhen scored successively, tying the score at 9 to 9. Shanghai College's Sun and Feng each罚 scored one point, thus taking the lead again by two points. Zhenru's spirit was extraordinary, unstoppable. Old Huang Zhong (Huang Zhaolin) and Yin Guiren scored two goals in a row, surpassing Shanghai College 13 to 11. Shanghai College's Passing Is Excellent. Shanghai College called a timeout, reorganized its forces, and Feng Nianhua scored two long shots, greatly boosting morale, thus surpassing Zhenru again 15 to 13. Han Zhenyuan made it 15-15. Shanghai College's five tigers worked together in perfect harmony, showing excellent short passing, which was magical and breathtaking. The five tigers worked hard, each showing their unique skills. Although Zhenru was strong, they were troubled by the tight defense of each player, with few chances to shoot the basket. Therefore, at the end of the first half, Shanghai College won 27 to 16.</p>
<p>Smooth Sailing From Then On. After the break, Huang Zhaolin of Zhenru罰 scored first, and Xu Rongshui and Han Zhenyuan each scored one, adding five points. Shanghai College, with its tight defense and fierce forwards, had smooth sailing from then on, always victorious. Zhenru, at this point, felt inferior. Although they were still unwilling to show weakness, Huang Zhaolin repeatedly made wonderful long shots, winning praise from the audience. However, the gains did not offset the losses, and it was difficult to recover. The largest score difference was 39 to 23. As a result, Shanghai College won 49 to 37.</p>

<p>The Western Youth basketball team, i.e., the champion team of the Western Youth Basketball League, the Pirates, is strong, needless to say. In the last game against Jianhua, due to Jianhua's forfeit, they did not have the chance to show their skills. Last night was the first official show of their skills against Tongji, which also had some impressive players. The competition between the two sides was quite interesting. However, Tongji was too careless in the first half, and Western Youth won 35 to 9. In the second half, Tongji worked hard, and the situation was quite good. Western Youth was difficult to suppress and could not reduce their momentum. The situation suddenly became balanced, and Tongji was only behind by three points, which was not easy. But in the end, Western Youth won 52 to 23.</p>

<h3 id="e176">Six-Character Couplet <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>I have an old friend, Mr. Ziyang, who has been in politics for a long time and has just returned from Peiping. When we met, after shaking hands and exchanging pleasantries, I asked him about the current political situation. He stroked his goatee and replied, "Where to begin with a history of twenty-four dynasties? But to say a few summarizing words, I once composed a six-character couplet that is not only well-matched but also worth a new exposé of the officialdom." I asked, "What is the six-character couplet?" He said: "Flatter superiors, pass the days; brag loudly, steal the show."</p>
<p>The matching of the six-character couplet is ingenious, truly "the essence of writing is natural, the marvel comes by chance"; but to say that it is worth a new exposé of the officialdom, this scope is too narrow! It must be known that "flatter superiors, pass the days; brag loudly, steal the show" is the meaning of the six-character couplet from any society, ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign; the only difference is the thickness and thinness of the quality!</p>
<p>The power of flattery can encompass everything in the world and more; only because the wheel of time is constantly advancing, everything that cannot keep up will have its day of obsolescence. Sages will become obsolete, classics will become obsolete, science and art will become obsolete; only the flattery experts who are suitable for the past, the present, and the future will never become obsolete! As the saying goes: "A thousand wears, ten thousand wears, flattery never wears out;" this is the ironclad proof that flatterers will not become obsolete.</p>
<p>The habit of bragging cannot be broken by anyone; especially writers, look at the authors of the past and present, who does not do some bragging poetry and prose? Especially merchants, look at the merchants selling around the world, who does not do some bragging commercial advertising? Especially the publicity personnel in the military and political circles, whose bragging is strong, is whose limelight is healthy; their work, besides "bragging loudly, stealing the show", is best described as "not for other use".</p>
<p>Mr. Ziyang's six-character couplet is indeed an unbreakable saying from ancient times to the present, from China to abroad.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Good Things All Turn Bad <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Lily</p>
<p>丨Aggressors Should Be Careful of Turning Bad丨</p>
<p>Free love could have overthrown blind marriages. Free love could have been the main road for legitimate unions of men and women. However, in recent years, Chinese young men and women have been talking about free love and marriage freedom, and in the end, nine out of ten, before they even reach formal union, have already loved someone else. "Free love" has become a synonym for illicit cohabitation between men and women.</p>
<p>Opium, morphine, sleeping pills, etc., have always been used for medical purposes in Europe and the United States, and countless patients have benefited from these drugs. But when opium arrived in China, everyone swallowed clouds and spat fog to smoke it, and morphine, etc., were made into red pills and white pills. Sleeping pills have become a direct tool for suicide.</p>
<p>Students go abroad to study. Those who study political science come back to China to specialize in making money and arguing. Those who study military science come back to China to devote themselves to civil war. Is this what these students learned abroad?</p>
<p>Socialism in Soviet Russia has created the amazing achievement of completing the Five-Year Plan in four years, with orderly domestic order and the respect of all countries. But I remember when the Kuomintang and the Communist Party were not divided, socialism was also popular for a while, but the result was that wives killed their husbands, sons killed their fathers, finances went bankrupt, and all industries stagnated, forming a situation of public wives and common property, destroying everything beyond recognition. Even with the recent Communist bandits in Jiangxi, their achievements are nothing more than killing and arson.</p>
<p>The Japanese say: "No matter what it is, if it is good in other countries, it all turns bad when it comes to China." This sentence seems to be somewhat insulting. But when we think carefully, there is some truth in this statement. The examples mentioned above are just a few that have been picked up casually, and they are enough to prove what the Japanese said.</p>
<p>"Oranges change to trifoliate oranges when they cross the Huai River." No matter what it is, it will turn bad when it comes to China, so if someone comes to invade China, we will let them invade. If they do anything on Chinese land, they are guaranteed to fail and end badly.</p>

<p>— Shao Zhenzhi</p>
<p>丨New Year's Eve丨</p>
<p>All industries are competing, and the glass windows are displaying all kinds of goods, all trying to attract customers; and at the door of each house, on average, there is a beggar standing. Especially at night, squatting in front of the streets, yelling on the roads, are they refugees or beggars? They can even surpass the six thousand streetcars and countless well-fed people. This is the impression before January 25.</p>
<p>The snow is fluttering, the hotels are warm, the cinemas are full, the Taoist temples, temples, and Buddhist associations are all ringing bells to pray! The charity halls are, as usual, distributing rice tickets to those who are not really poor and in pain, and the lower-class prostitutes are still selling cold on the streets when people call out in the middle of the night. The cold north wind is constantly bullying them.</p>
<p>Are they not as good as dogs? This is not necessarily the case. In my opinion, people are still smarter.</p>
<p>Let's look at the matter of dogs biting people: when they bite, they bare their teeth and claws and pounce forward regardless of their lives! They don't care if the person being bitten is empty-handed or holding a stick, or even aiming a knife or gun at them! But people, do you think they are so stupid? Usually, when they put on their "two and a half feet" of armed uniform, look how smug they are! But as soon as someone says they are coming to fight, they run faster than dogs! Because they are smarter than dogs, they know: endure humiliation and bear heavy burdens! Don't suffer immediate losses. This is one.</p>
<p>When a dog fails to bite someone, it only "howls" once, tucks its tail, and runs away in a puff of smoke. There is no other action. As for people, that is not the case; the enemy has not yet attacked, and as soon as they put up a fight, they run away without their lives! Their hearts are full of "greed for life and fear of death, and living in ease and comfort"! But they shout out loud: "You all have to calm down, let me slowly call for countermeasures"! May I ask: Is a dog this smart? This is two.</p>
<p>When a dog is beaten, it remembers the hatred: whenever it encounters its enemy, it always bares its teeth and claws! To let its enemy know: I have a deep hatred that has not been avenged! But people, they don't care: even if they break my door, enter my room, and beat me black and blue, as soon as they turn around, they can "drink wine and make peace"! Dogs cannot compare to this kind of magnanimity! This is three.</p>
<p>Also, dogs cannot resist, they tuck their tails and squat.</p>

<p>There was an enemy who could speak Chinese, shouting loudly: "Hey, now the emperor sees that you are very pitiful, and told us to bring a lot of silver dollars to reward you... How can you not understand the rules? Kneel down quickly... Have you all knelt down?... Good, kneel like this, don't move, let us take a photo of you first for the emperor to see, so that he knows that you have all received the reward... Kneel well, don't move, you will receive the reward after the photo is taken..."</p>
<p>More than three thousand men, women, old and young people knelt on the ground with their waists straight and necks straight, staring blankly at the enemy, not knowing what kind of trick he was going to play.</p>
<p>"This won't do, you all have to lower your heads, you can't raise them... Otherwise, if the photo is taken, the emperor will say that you are not respectful, and he won't reward you next time..."</p>
<p>More than three thousand men, women, old and young people listened obediently, and one by one they lowered their heads, looking at the ground. From a distance, it looked like a dark mass of heads hiding in their wings, sleeping birds. As soon as their heads were lowered, their necks were exposed; the snow fell on their skin in clumps, and they could only shake their heads, not daring to use their sleeves to cover them, and had to clench their teeth, rolling their eyelids upwards to peek at how the enemies were taking pictures of them, hoping in their hearts that they would hurry up and take a picture casually. The people kneeling in the first row saw in the corner of their eyes that the enemies were busy setting up tripods, and then installed a dark, shiny cylinder on the tripod. They also saw Japanese soldiers stuffing a cloth strip inside. There were at least seventeen or eight of them surrounding them in a large circle. They were all curious, thinking: Is this cylinder the camera? Are all these people photographed on that cloth strip? They are really lucky today: they can get a reward and open their eyes! Photography...</p>
<p>The people in the middle rows, because their necks were constantly being drenched, and the water turned into ice, which was very uncomfortable, peeked out and saw that several enemies were squatting on the ground, not paying attention to them; they slightly raised their heads to move their necks. (Six)</p>
<p>"Please, Stove God!" "Winter plum, winter plum," "Charcoal, charcoal," "Golden flower, Yuanbin flower," "Large version of the almanac, small version of the almanac," ... Ding ding da da; large baskets and small baskets of "New Year's goods" are very lively.</p>
<p>Firecrackers are louder than machine guns, and the sound of "Congratulations on getting rich" is still as good as in previous years. The phenomenon of "unease" was in Shanghai last year, and this year it is in Peiping. Hankou doesn't need to worry anyway, and just goes on "doing its own thing." Only on January 28 did entertainment stop for one day, and on January 28, a tragedy of "Song Ruhai being hit hard" was staged at the Zhongshan Park ball field.</p>
<p>"Alive, alive," vendors of lantern sell lanterns again.</p>
<p>There are especially many people at Guiyuan Temple in Hanyang, with many red men and green women squeezing in to worship. It is fun and beautiful. "Shang Jiu Wan" and "Yuanxiao" are especially crowded, and other Zen forests cannot compare.</p>
<p>Bronze drums, foreign horns, machine plays, sound machines, and silk strings and gongs and drums, ... modern men and women, fashionable lanterns, beggars, refugees, ... these can be seen and heard in hotels, cinemas, shops, streets and alleys.</p>
<p>However, the content of Hankou is still difficult to figure out?</p>

<p>— Fei Fei</p>
<p>丨People Are Still Smarter丨</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Yiyi's great work "Are People Not As Good As Dogs" the other day, it was really flavorful! But after thinking carefully: When a dog is talked about, it bows its head and has nothing to say. However, this is not the case with people. They do not allow you to laugh, do not allow you to cry, and do not allow you to shout! Otherwise, he snorts and immediately tells you to "stop breathing"! How many chapters and articles, how many 'damn'! May I ask: Does a dog have this kind of power? This is four.</p>
<p>The kind of person I mentioned, although not many in our group, really exists! For years, I have been obliged to praise Yang Yizhang's "hidden virtue" and "hidden light"! Its merit is probably no less than Yu's!</p>
<h3 id="e181">Small Knowledge <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>A Short History of Stamps</p>
<p>The stamps used in the world are of many kinds and are constantly emerging, which can be described as the ultimate in variety. Looking at its history, it is ninety-eight years old. The era of the first stamp invention was in 1834. The inventor of the stamp was an Englishman named GuuegGkulmers.</p>
<p>In 1840, the British government had a proposal to create a one-penny stamp, printed on the envelope, and instructed the people to use this kind of stamped envelope. However, because it was not easy to use, the public opposed it, and as a result, they adopted the adhesive stamp invented by Postalers.</p>
<p>The United States did not use stamps until 1847: it also used adhesive stamps. This is a small piece of the history of stamps.</p>
<p>How Many Dialects Are There in the World?</p>
<p>The dialects in the world, including various local languages, number about three thousand four hundred. These dialects, mostly due to the isolation of the climate and the habits that have been passed down, are forever difficult to change. This huge number of dialects naturally mostly belongs to uncivilized savages. There are more than 900 in Asia, more than 600 in Europe, more than 275 in Africa, and more than 1,600 in the Americas.</p>
<p>The Reason for Pain</p>
<p>No matter which part of our body has a sore or is cut by a knife, we will immediately feel pain. But how does the pain process work, and how do we feel it? It is because there is a nerve center on people's backs; from this center, tiny nerves are spread like spider webs all over the body. If an abnormal state occurs in a certain part of our body, the tiny nerves immediately report to the center, and we feel pain. However, the distribution of nerves is denser in some parts, or closer to the skin, and the sensation in those parts is particularly sensitive. Conversely, the sensation is relatively slow and pure. For example, the nerves in the heel of the foot are not close to the skin surface, so the sensation is the slowest.</p>
<p>When we cut a finger, the blood vessels and tiny nerves on the finger are broken at the same time. The sneaky blood cannot be transported back to the heart from the original tube, so it gushes out from the cut, becoming bleeding. At the same time, the tiny nerves report the discomfort to the brain, and we feel pain. Because the skin at the cut is broken and the inside comes into contact with oxygen in the air, the tiny nerves are agitated, and the brain increases the sensation of pain. Therefore, to put it simply, the reason for pain is just a feeling caused by nerve agitation. For example, when cutting a disease in a hospital, the nerves in the area to be cut are anesthetized first, and the patient will not feel pain when cutting; also, if the dentist removes the nerves of a decayed tooth using anesthesia, although the decayed tooth still exists, the patient will never experience pain again. That is because the nerves have lost the ability to report, and the brain is like a person in Peach Blossom Spring who does not hear about outside affairs, and will forever live in a numb and peaceful world, without feeling pain!</p>
<p>How Do We Feel Hungry?</p>
<p>Hunger, jokingly speaking, is "the stomach is doing mischief," but a further understanding is that the stomach needs food. But according to physiology, the second theory is also seemingly right. Because human blood is constantly circulating and growing, and when the time is right, the materials for making new blood are declared to be lacking; this report of lacking blood materials reaches the stomach, and people feel hungry. Because people's food, when it reaches the stomach, absorbs the essential elements from the food through the stomach and mixes it with another kind of juice to make new blood. Therefore, the stomach is just a factory for making blood. It can be seen that the reason for human hunger is not just a matter of the stomach, but the whole body needs new blood materials. We can use extremely simple facts to prove this. A person who is extremely hungry only needs to inject the materials for making blood into the large intestine, and even if it does not pass through the stomach, the person's hunger can be alleviated and eaten.</p>

<h3 id="e182">Financial News: Gold Price Rises, Buyers Delighted <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign dispatches indicated: London spot and forward rates both rose 0.0625; the British-American exchange rate hesitantly rose 3.75; the American-British exchange rate rose 1.875; the New York silver price appeared to rise 0.25, but in reality, the increase was not significant, as it remained unchanged from last Saturday; forward silver prices only rose 0.003 to 0.009, which was also insignificant; a bank private dispatch showed a rise of 0.0625; American cotton fell 0.05-0.06 pounds. Therefore, although the Shanghai gold market opened low, it remained relatively stable, at 787.2 taels. The exchange market saw April U.S. dollars hard to sell at 28.625 yuan, dropping to 5.8 taels. Afterwards, prices trended higher, with major players actively buying, including Heng Yu, Fu Yu, and Yuan Mao competing to purchase large quantities. The exchange market also tightened. The Yokohama Specie Bank frequently engaged in arbitrage, buying up current-month U.S. dollars at 3.75, pushing through the 90 tael barrier, and further arbitraging the same month at 3.125, reaching 793.4 taels. The midday close was at 3.1 taels. In the afternoon, prices initially rose and then stabilized. Zhejiang bought up April U.S. dollars at 3.75, further fueled by May already trading at 5.625, pushing the price to 94.3 taels. Both the exchange and gold markets then gradually turned back. Banque Belge bought February U.S. dollars at 3.125, and Hefeng offered March at 3.75, leading to a downward trend. Furthermore, American Express sold March at 4.375, causing a drop to 1.8 taels. Major players forcefully supported the market, pulling prices back and hovering around 2 taels. Finally, the market closed at 792.3 taels. The sentiment throughout the day was extremely positive, with major players all buying in, demand exceeding supply, justifying the price increase. The Central Bank’s spot market was weaker and extremely quiet today. Swap spreads were still posted by short sellers, with slightly higher prices, ranging from 1.2 to 1.3 taels, but trading volume was minimal. The daily market conditions are detailed below:</p>
<h3 id="e183">Breaking 90 Taels <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>The morning opened at 787.2 taels, slightly lower by 1.1 taels from the previous close. Sentiment was stable, so prices hovered between 7 and 7.5 taels after the opening. The exchange market opened with the British exchange rate relatively flat, with near-term prices quoted at 1 shilling 8.0625 pence. The U.S. dollar was slightly softer, at 28.4375 yuan. Tianfeng Yong first sold, and Fuchang also sold down to 6.5 taels. Dadecheng advanced to around 7 taels. April U.S. dollars at 6.25 were difficult to sell. Fuchang sold again, and Yuanheng also offered, causing prices to fluctuate and trend downwards, gradually retreating to 85.8 taels. After that, adversity turned into prosperity. The gold price, after being suppressed for consecutive days, found a way out. Citibank bought up April U.S. dollars at 6.875. Zhaofengchang made slight advances, at 6.5 taels. Hengxing advanced to around 7 taels. Andar sold May at 7.5, still retreating to 6.3 taels. Hengxing, Zhifeng Yong, and others advanced to around 7 taels.

Zhifeng Yong and Fuyu continued to buy, pushing the price past the 90 tael barrier, reaching 90.08 taels, as the Yokohama Specie Bank bought current-month U.S. dollars at 3.75. Yongfeng came to unload, returning within 90 taels, at 9.8 taels, then observing outside 90 taels. Banque Belge bought May at 6.875. Hengxing bought, reaching beyond 1 tael. The Yokohama Specie Bank again bought current-month U.S. dollars at only 3.125. Fuyu and Yongfeng bought up to 2 taels. Fuyu, Daxing Yong, and Zhifeng Yong further engaged in aggressive buying, reaching 93.4 taels. At this point, the gold market stabilized. Dadecheng and Fuyu occasionally sold, but sentiment was stable, allowing them to hold above 2 taels for a long time. When current-month U.S. dollars were again priced at 3.75, Zhaofengchang sold within 2 taels. Fuyu came to add to its position, returning to 2.5 taels. At this time, it was near the close, and the market became slightly quieter. Arbitrageurs suddenly came to add to their positions, reaching beyond 3 taels. Soon after, the market closed at 793.1 taels. Arbitrageurs sold at 2.8 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Gradual Stabilization After Rise <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>The afternoon opened at 792.8 taels. Initially, the market was extremely quiet, hovering around 3 taels for a long time. Before long, Hengyu buying in boosted the market, reaching 4 taels. Zhifeng Yong, limited by its trading limit, sold at 4 taels, temporarily halting the advance and retreating to 3.5 taels. Richang and Yuanmao Yong bought in, but Fuchang and Hengxing sold, resulting in weak trading activity, taking a long time. Later, Zhejiang buying up April U.S. dollars at 3.75 pushed the market beyond 4 taels to 94.3 taels. Dadecheng made slight advances around 4 taels. Although retail investors sold, the market was still able to hold. When East Asia sold May U.S. dollars at 5.625, the market retreated within 4 taels. The gold price then turned back, further fueled by Banque Belge quoting current-month U.S. dollars at 3.125, and Hefeng offering March at 3.75, and Zhongfu selling April at half a yuan, reaching 3 taels. Qingfayong came to unload, falling below 3 taels. Hengyu bought in, holding at around 3 taels.

Retail investors sold, retreating 0.03 taels, to 2.2 taels. At this time, it was nearing the close, and various firms had stopped buying and selling. The market was only maintained by retail investors and arbitrageurs. Finally, the market closed at 792.3 taels. After the close, retail investors seemed to be trending towards buying, but Hengxing sold at a limited price of 2.5 taels, so arbitrageurs still sold at the same price. The highest price of the day was 794.3 taels, and the lowest price was 785.8 taels, a fluctuation of 8.5 taels. As a result, the price rose by 4 taels compared to the previous close (last Saturday).</p>
<h3 id="e185">Short by Four Taels <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>The listed price, due to HSBC's rates for the U.S. dollar remaining unchanged at 28.125 yuan, translates to a standard gold price of 853.333 taels. Based on the closing price, it was suppressed by approximately 61 taels, less suppressed by 4 taels compared to the previous close. The registered price for this month was 794 taels, and for March, 793 taels. The morning replenishment was 794 taels, and the afternoon was 793 taels.</p>

The Dalian group sold slightly, and the Guangdong group, Hengxing, made slight advances. Shengda made minimal purchases and sales.

<p>Yesterday's Hage chits were still calculated at 10.075 taels per 100 taels. The market was extremely quiet, and trading was leisurely. Only Yingfenghang sold a flat to Tongfeng Yong, with a trading volume of less than 100 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Swap Spreads Also Quiet <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>

Dadecheng gave Yongfeng 7 swaps, priced at 1.3 taels. In the afternoon, Dadecheng gave Hanheng 84 swaps, priced at 1.2 taels, but this price was hard to get. Hengxing has recently been inclined to offer swaps, acting on behalf of customers.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Exchange Market Turns Bullish From Weak <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's exchange market was initially weak and then tight. Initially, foreign dispatches indicated that London spot and forward rates both rose 0.0625, slightly raising exchange rates. Therefore, the British exchange market opened relatively flat, with near-term prices quoted at 1 shilling 8.0625 pence.

Therefore, although the U.S. dollar opened higher, the increase was not significant, with near-term prices quoted at 28.4375 yuan. Initially, it briefly trended firmer, but after HSBC's rates remained unchanged, it turned tighter, increasing by about 1.875.

<p>Wide fluctuations due to ample supply of spot goods!</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign interest rate was slightly lower by 0.0025, at 0.0712875. The situation remained stable. The volume of interbank transfers made was 655,000 yuan, banknotes 50,000 yuan. Outside the market, banknotes were 75,000 yuan, and checks were 35,000 yuan. There was still no market activity in the afternoon. Trading between banks was 850,000 yuan. The morning silver interest rate still opened white interest. In the afternoon, the Shanghai Bankers' Association still did not inject additional funds. The turnover of interest rate tickets was over 2.8 million yuan. Bank receipts and disbursements, and transactions with foreign firms were only over 700,000 yuan. Yarn tickets received and issued were 1.4-1.5 million yuan. Silver receipts and disbursements, and receipts and disbursements of tickets by Chinese merchants were 1.5-1.6 million yuan. Receipts and disbursements of tickets by foreign merchants were over 1.9 million yuan. Receipts and disbursements for various items such as exchange, goods, mortgages, customs duties, special expenses, advances, and telegraphic transfers were over 1.1 million yuan. Warehouse entries were 300,000 yuan, and warehouse exits were 500,000 yuan. Receipts and disbursements for money shops and foreign public notes were over 3.2 million yuan.

The morning price of auxiliary currency, Jiangsu small coins, was 0.0633 yuan, with a trading volume of 6,000 jiao. Guangdong small coins fell sharply due to abundant inventory of Dalian coins, which could not be sold off. Yesterday, it fell slightly by 0.000475, to 0.05935 yuan, with a trading volume of 55,000 jiao. Copper coins remained unchanged, still at the same price as the previous day, at 416 wen, with a trading volume of 47-48,000 wen.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Reversal of Fortune for Jiao Coins <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>In late January of this year, which was the Lunar New Year holiday, due to the customary practice of small money shops, there was a significant surge in auxiliary currency at the end of the year. Therefore, many small money shops hoarded large quantities of Dalian double jiao coins in their warehouses, and mortgaged them to banks and money shops, hoping to get a good price at the time and seek a hefty profit. Unexpectedly, this time during the New Year holiday, a large batch of spot jiao coins from Dalian was shipped to Shanghai, and the areas along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway and the Yangtze River, knowing that jiao coins would rise at the end of the year, all shipped large quantities to Shanghai without prior agreement. Unexpectedly, the goods became stagnant upon arrival, overwhelming the market. In recent days, spot goods have been abundant. The large quantities of spot goods hoarded by Shanghai money shops were mortgaged and had to be sold off when the mortgages expired. As a result, they sold off their goods one after another, and market prices fell sharply. Yesterday, the exchange rate was so bad that it was possible to exchange 12.01 jiao for one yuan. This was truly an unexpected and special market situation.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Securities and Bond Market Resumes Full-Day Trading <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Prices Vary, and Trading is Not Smooth</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange and the Government Bond Market resumed full-day trading. Market prices fluctuated, and fluctuations were not consistent. After a brief rebound last Saturday, sentiment gradually became uncertain. In the morning's two trading sessions, the 20th series sold off heavily, while the 47th series had a strong absorption capacity, and the 4th and 5th series were also being bought in. However, due to numerous retail sales, price fluctuations were inconsistent. The first session initially saw a slight rise of a few cents, then rebounded by several cents. The second session saw a large rise of two to three cents. The consolidated salt tax, due to the heavy selling of the 20th series, fell slightly by 0.03-0.05 yuan. Therefore, trading was more active in the morning, with the consolidated salt tax and salt tax trading exceeding 2 million yuan. Trading was quieter in the afternoon. Retail investors continued to sell in the first session, and prices consistently retreated by 0.02-0.03 to 0.05-0.06 yuan. Before the close, various series saw a slight rebound. Retail investors and floor traders covering short positions rebounded by 0.03-0.05 yuan for the consolidated salt tax and salt tax. Overall, the market prices fluctuated throughout the day, showing signs of hovering. Whether the future of the situation will change, the situation has reached a critical point. Whether the situation will expand or become peaceful, the clear period should not be far away. Therefore, speculators are becoming more cautious, and trading has not been smooth as a result. Market prices are also fluctuating and uncertain. Yesterday's results showed that the forward salt tax rose by 0.015 yuan, the 96 series rose by 0.03 yuan, and the rest fell. The 19 series fell the most, by 1 yuan. The regular 6 consolidated tax and salt tax only fell by 0.02-0.03 yuan this month, and the rest fell by about 0.5 yuan. The total trading volume was 7.093 million yuan. The spot trading volume was only 23,000 yuan. The futures trading volume for the consolidated salt tax was around 2.8 million yuan, and the rest of the series totaled only 4 million yuan.</p>

<p>Newfeng Foreign Firm reported that the New York stock market last week saw continued strength in gold mining stocks, reaching new highs for the year. Other stocks were weak. The total trading volume for half a day was only 420,000 shares. The total number of railway freight cars was 472,088, a decrease of 24,346 from the previous week. It was also heard that members of the Senate Monetary System Committee believed that the implementation of the silver proposal was practically impossible. The stock market last week was quite weak, with dividend reductions for several top stocks, weakness in the Canadian exchange rate, uncertainty in negotiations on war debt issues, adverse effects of extending rural lending, and a general lack of confidence in the recovery of spring industry and commerce, all contributing to the market's weakness. However, it is not expected to cause a large-scale selling panic. The situation in the coming days may continue to be weak, but it should be able to maintain the resistance line that has been in place for several months. The Dow Jones index for the 4th is listed below:</p>

<p>The yarn market remains stagnant, with no signs of recovery. The industry feels increasingly depressed, and the market is unusually quiet. However, many people believe that the market is weak at its base, and the sales of yarn will improve this year. They remain committed to the bullish outlook. However, recalling the commercial failures and financial exhaustion in various regions last year, the unstable situation, and the increasingly urgent external anxieties, how can business have a full chance of success? In addition, the domestic and foreign cotton yarn situation is trending downwards. If yarn sales remain stagnant, inventory will accumulate more and more heavily. The delivery of February is as high as 6-7,000 bales, and future changes cannot be predicted.</p>

However, a group of speculators remained bullish and refused to let go. In the afternoon, the gold price was slightly higher, and the intention to raise prices was renewed. The delivery volume for February is estimated at 230,000 dan of coarse velvet cotton. From the perspective of the global trend, the future of the cotton market is not optimistic.</p>

<p>Yesterday, sources included a few number twenties, after Shanghai has been contracting due to the continuous contracting in Pudong. Shanghai sources were thin. Though the sale of small amounts of rice are still not smooth, but there were limited amounts of rice. there are low inventories of rice, in addition to there is the continous activity of large purchases of thousand stones. The Su Tong gang and the green angle rice of South port also quoted higher prices and the sharp Lu rice also quoted higher prices. The price of rice that is a sharp Yang type is stable. The newly released Lu rice is priced at 8 yuan 4 jiao per year. It has been heard that large scale purcahses have been activated but the rice market activity will not see a boom for the time being. Influenced by the situation in Tianjin, the money supply is tight, causing the price there to be only 10.08-10.09 yuan. The market price of 9.45 yuan for old Hai rice in Shanghai is suitable. On top of the water fee of 1.4 yuan, there is no profit from trade. Therefore, Tianjin rice merchants are unwilling to buy much. Looking back at the passport statistics, before and after, 330,000 bags have been received. Since the government cancelled the domestic circulation passport on February 1, Shanghai rice merchants have only used more than 200,000 bags of passports. Nearly hundreds of thousands of bags have not been used. After the cancellation, Shanghai merchants have suffered losses. It has now been agreed that 0.08 yuan per bag of rice will be added to compensate for the loss of passport fees. The passports will be cancelled after the full amount is withdrawn.</p>

<p>Yesterday, over thirty shops sourced their rice from areas around the river, of which high quality white rice was selling fast but medium quality was selling flat. The market shape of Zhong Guan saw an increase in quotes, in addition thin rice continued to arrive for sale. the market shape was smooth. The amount of early rice arriving was little and sales were lively and its market shape was thriving. There were few sources of Yangjian rice, sales were brisk, and the price shape was stable. There was a lack of rice coming from the port and the custom rice price trend was set. There were few sources of Yin Yuan rice and the price was stable, but there was a constant stream of Bai Yuan rice arriving which slowed down disassembly and sales, and the price was shortened by 0.2-0.3 yuan again.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Passenger Xiang Price Falls, Sales Are Active <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, both the Passenger Xiang and local Passenger rice were selling actively, but the price fell slightly by 0.1-0.3 yuan. The market for Passenger Xiang and Passenger Yuan rice has been soft. Yesterday, 5,000 bags of newly arrived Hunan-made Passenger Xiang and over 1,000 bags of Passenger Yuan also arrived. The owners were keen to sell early, so there were many price cuts to seek sales. The slight decline in prices attracted purchases from Dingzhou and local merchants, and the market was quite active. However, the general market price declined. The local merchants bought 1,500 bags of Jiangxi-made late rice from the local market, with prices ranging from 9.04 yuan to 8.7 yuan. The Fuzhou merchants also bought 220 bags of Hunan-made machine-pressed oil rice, with prices ranging from 9.2 yuan, 9.12 yuan to 9 yuan. In addition, 300 bags of machine-pressed red rice were sold for 8.6 yuan. 574 bags of machine-pressed Yuan rice from Wuhu were sold for prices ranging from 10.03 yuan, 10.01 yuan to 9.7 yuan.

<h3 id="e210">Bean Cake Sales Not Strong, Bean Market Still Flat <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean cake factories' desire to sell soybeans was just starting to bud because bean cake sales had only just begun to move, and there were no large-scale movements. Therefore, the bean side showed a lack of vigor, so the bean market temporarily lacked momentum to rise. However, in terms of supply, a small number of trains arrived. Dalian beans had disappeared. In the future, once the bean market becomes active, in this thin and scarce situation, there may be a surprising surge. Some merchants from Wenzhou inquired about bean cakes, but because the factory price for authentic bean cakes had to be 1 tael and 4 qian, no transactions were made. According to industry insiders, price cuts are necessary to stimulate demand. Red bean stock is thin, and supply is also small. Demand from rural villages is still strong. Taicang beans are several cents more expensive. Sesame is high and flat, then weakens. Only a small number of shipments of wheat from Wenzhou arrived continuously. Because the market has few goods, it is stable. Buyers are actively purchasing along the factory route. It is said that the current wheat market depends on the factory's increase or decrease in the standard flour wheat price.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the flour market was generally flat in the morning for all months. Imported wheat quotations were slightly lower by about 1 jiao. However, the current lack of confidence is due to completely quiet customer sales. There is no activity in the spot market. Historically, the current month has always ended up inverted, but now it is gradually leveling out. The inverted situation is purely due to the tight spot delivery. When the market opened in the afternoon, the far-term months still tended to be stable. However, the current month still fell sharply, because there were fewer sales in the market, and customers continued to withdraw. The factory's asking price for spot flour also showed signs of softening. Standard "Battleship" and "Old Car" brands added only 5 fen, and miscellaneous brands added 3 fen. The asking price for Australian wheat was still 3 taels and 5 qian. The Nanjing factory required Nanjing packaging and offered 3 taels, 5 qian, and 3 fen. Foreign firms were only willing to trade if a whole ship was purchased. The factory reportedly only had enough appetite for half a ship, so no transaction was made. It is expected that it will be necessary to wait for customer activity to generate vitality. As a result, the current month fell sharply by 2.75 fen compared to the previous week, March fell slightly by 5 li, and there was no change in April to July.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning, the wheat futures market was generally calm. There were very few transactions in the near-term months, with little fluctuation. July new wheat futures were soft due to low prices of imported wheat, with a fall of 2 fen compared to the previous week. When the market opened in the afternoon, the market was slightly firmer due to outside speculators covering shorts. However, industry insiders who wanted to get out of their hedges could not find anyone to take them. The July new wheat futures also became firmer as some firms from Hubei made some purchases. As a result, the current month did not open, March was up by 1 fen, April was up by 2 fen, June opened at 3 taels, 2 qian, and 7 fen, but there was no such price, and July was up by 1 fen.</p>
<p>(4th) Chicago wheat fell due to a weak stock market and selling from the East. On the 3rd, a total of 10 million bushels were traded. The market prices on the 4th are listed below:</p>

<p>The prices of Kailuan coal sold in the market recently vary between the company and the merchants. The reason is that the goods currently sold by the merchants are all orders placed last year when prices were low, while the large quantities currently sold by the company are based on this year's new market conditions, so they are higher. Therefore, the selling prices of the two parties cannot be consistent. For example, the prices made in the market yesterday were 8 taels and 3 qian for No. 1 coal dross and 7 taels and 8 qian for No. 2 coal dross, and 8 taels and 5 qian for Kailuan coal blocks, while the prices sold by the merchants were 1 qian, 2 qian, 3 qian, or 4 qian lower per ton.</p>

<h3 id="e222">Simple Identification Method for Woolen Cloth Quality <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>When purchasing woolen cloth for clothing: (1) Consider whether the material is durable and wearable. (2) What kind of material should be matched for what kind of clothing? For example, for lined robes or camel hair robes, it is best to choose dark brown patterned woolen cloth or solid-color and mixed-color Ward woolen cloth. Matching materials are easy, but selecting materials is difficult for laymen. If you want to buy patterned woolen cloth, the texture must be soft, and it is best to hold it up to the sky and see that there are very few holes. Ward woolen cloth must be double-sided, and the heavier the body, the better. Rub it with your fingers (using your thumb and forefinger). If it moves smoothly, it has more wool content. If it is stiff and does not move, it is mostly yarn. In general, for woolen cloth, a firm texture is good, and a loose and hard texture is bad. A firm texture is durable and does not shed hair for a long time. A loose texture easily generates hairballs and is not durable. Therefore, whether it is serge, patterned woolen cloth, Ward woolen cloth, gabardine, or other various woolen fabrics, a tight and firm texture is valuable. Experts look at goods by first examining this point. For plain serge, also look at the thickness of the pattern. A fine and dense pattern is better. For yuan gabardine, a clear grain and pure color are of the highest quality. Lihua dyeing and those with Western English “England Fruit” characters are guaranteed not to fade. Test with a drop of nitric acid water. If the color turns tiger yellow, it will also not fade. If it changes to another color, it will fade. However, this is limited to the dyeing of gabardine and Ward woolen cloth. Patterned woolen cloth, which is woven from mixed-color wool threads, is not subject to this rule because it is woven from three or four colors of wool thread, so it cannot change color. In the summer, if you want to make a single long gown, it is best to make patterned woolen cloth that is firm and light, or all-wool feather yarn for suits. Do not make ordinary mercerized striped feather yarn. Because summer gowns must be washed and ironed, rayon striped feather yarn will be damaged in no time. Once exposed to sunlight, it fades very quickly. Therefore, never be greedy for cheap prices and suffer losses. If you want something cheap, you can cut plain-colored feather yarn. As for plain serge that costs 7 or 8 jiao per foot, most of it is French goods. It will change color in no time and is not durable. Compared to Ward woolen cloth, at a ratio of one to three, it is better to buy raw wool or sesame-colored serge. In cold weather, you can buy melton or rotten paste wool, which is cheaper and very durable. It is much more durable than lower-grade cooked wool serge that costs 7 or 8 jiao per foot.</p>

<h3 id="e238">Su Xiaoxiao and Lady White Snake (2) <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Let's look at these two stories in a complex way. This is a good comparison. Su Xiaoxiao lived a life of aesthetic hedonism. She was a typical modern woman; she was the Oriental Camille. Lady White Snake is the opposite. She is a virtuous wife, completely sacrificing herself for her husband. But Su Xiaoxiao takes herself as the center and spins the male world upside down; writers thousands of years later continue to support her. Lady White Snake takes her "husband" as "heaven", following her husband's lead. The husband treats her as a monster and a snake, covering her head with a bowl and suppressing her body with the Leifeng Pagoda, preventing her from being born. Since the Southern Song Dynasty, our Chinese ethical code has gradually become complete and meticulous. Why is Su Xiaoxiao treated with such tolerance, and Lady White Snake treated so harshly? Isn't this worth considering? Originally, the leisurely and enjoyable life of an agricultural society was monopolized by the aristocracy (royal family, ministers, etc.) and the landlord class. Under the doors of the aristocracy and landlords, there were staff members and scholars who helped them in their leisure activities. Although Su Xiaoxiao's life was not tolerated by ethical codes, it was precisely an object of enjoyment for the leisurely class. Confucius was even willing to see Nanzi, and the princes and grandsons were naturally willing to be overthrown by Su Xiaoxiao. The writers of Pucao had at least eight dous of talent, and each was a talented scholar; where there are talented scholars, there must be beautiful women, and Su Xiaoxiao is the best target for thousands of talented scholars! The talented scholars who hum "This is the place where jade was buried" can be seen on the lake embankment every day. Therefore, Su Xiaoxiao's life, although outside the ethical code of the literati and officials, was within the scope of the literati and officials and could stay there to add color to the lakes and mountains. As for Lady White Snake, she is Xu Xuan's housewife; as soon as the daughter-in-law enters the door, the mother-in-law is unhappy. Whenever the mother-in-law talks about her daughter-in-law, she always shakes her head and sighs, "Ever since that fox spirit from my family entered the door, my son has been listening to her pillow talk, and everything has changed!" So the east is that fairy is not good, and the west is that fairy is not good, forcing the son to abuse his daughter-in-law, which is what the old lady wants. Fellow students, don't think that we were born in the 20th century and received education. If you marry into a big family, it's good if there are no changes in the man's family in the first few years after entering the door. If there is any trouble, the father-in-law loses his job, the husband loses his job, and they all blame you as a jinx, cursing you every day, making you unable to live in peace. Women who faithfully do their duty as virtuous wives are destined to be "monsters" and have the fate of "snakes", which is truly unavoidable! In the window frame of a pharmacy on Simar Road in Shanghai, there sat a young man in a long gown and mandarin jacket. A big snake was entangled around his body, and the snake's head was a beauty; that was the best illustration of "women are snakes". An ethical teacher said: If my mother weren't a woman, I would have killed all women!!! Of course, Su Xiaoxiao will not be killed.</p>
<p>Lady White Snake is not afraid of Xu Xuan, but Xu Xuan has the bowl given to him by the Zen Master Fahai, covering her head, making her unable to move. What is this bowl? It is economic power. When Lady White Snake was pressed underground, Zen Master Fahai built the foundation of the pagoda, and many people were willing to do good deeds and build a huge Leifeng Pagoda. This huge Leifeng Pagoda is the traditional thinking of thousands of years. "Economic power" and "traditional thinking" have crushed all women. Now that the Leifeng Pagoda has collapsed, Lady White Snake, who has emerged, still has the bowl of Zen Master Fahai covering her head. Can she move? Who will break this bowl for Lady White Snake? Students, please think carefully! (End)</p>
<h3 id="e239">A Certain Kind of People <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Li Bing</p>
<p>In China, a certain kind of people seem to exist solely to sigh, just like another kind of people exist solely for enjoyment.</p>
<p>When the revolutionaries drove away the boy Puyi, cut off the queue brought by the "Manchus", and replaced the dragon flag with the five-color flag, the sighs of a certain kind of people were noisy for a while.</p>
<p>As time passed, people gradually got used to the "bald head" life. Changing the emperor to the president did not seem to do them any harm. It should have been quiet, but civil wars started, taxes increased, and life became more difficult. Therefore, the people who "live to sigh" sighed long and short for this and that. The sound was no different from when the "emperor" was driven away.</p>
<p>Until the year before last, "national disasters" came again. First, there was a major flood disaster across the country. Secondly, the three northeastern provinces were occupied by Japan. Thirdly, a corner of Shanghai was destroyed. The government was at a loss, and naturally this was another excellent opportunity for people who "live to sigh" to stretch their necks and sigh. So, a long sound, a short sound, a sigh, and a huff echoed each other. That gloomy, hopeless sound was still the traditional set of twenty-three years ago!</p>
<p>When a person feels pain and is dissatisfied with reality, he should have the courage to take revenge and the power to transform. Taking a step back, he should also have solemn and righteous criticism and judgment. Taking another step back, harsh sarcasm and humorous satire are still the actions of living people. Only that gloomy sigh expresses despair and disillusionment!</p>
<p>A person who firmly grasps life has no time to sigh for himself. No matter how difficult, no matter how disastrous, no matter how oppressed, he can only keep fighting and be responsible for his own life. Sighing is a pathetic act of expressing that he has no grasp of his own life, it is the groan of a ghost, and the wail of a phantom.</p>
<p>However, the groans of ghosts and the wails of phantoms at least show that this era is not a "daytime" illuminated by sunshine, but a dark "night of death". Then, let us let this gloomy groan and the dark night of death pass together!</p>
<h3 id="e240">Humble Feelings After Reading the "Special Issue on the Lexical Liberation Movement" <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Qiu</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 5th of this month, I happened to pass by the place of my "friend" Li Liewen and accidentally saw the "Special Issue on the Lexical Liberation Movement" of his New Era (1) monthly magazine on his desk. I thought that since the poem liberation movement had already allowed our (not "my friend's") old Dr. Hu to enjoy his fame in our country for more than ten years, then the lexical liberation movement would certainly not be "very rigid", let alone this being a "special issue", which is naturally more "Young men and women, must read," and after reading it, there will be "unexpected effects." So I made up my mind to specifically ask my "friend" Li Liewen for this "special issue" and take it back to read with "my wife, Ms. XX." My "friend" Li Liewen was generous after all. The "special issue" was obtained immediately, so I took it back happily, burned three incense sticks, brewed two bowls of Longjing tea, solemnly opened the "special issue," and began to read it seriously, singing along with my wife.</p>
<p>After all, the "liberated lyrics" and the "unliberated lyrics" are "very different," just as women's liberated feet and unliberated three-inch golden lilies are very different. My wife, Ms. XX, and I read it piece by piece, and we read Mr. Zeng XX's "extremely wonderful words." Mr. Zeng XX is the "founder of the lexical liberation movement," the founder's "lyrics,"!! No, the "liberated lyrics," are especially "very different." After my wife, Ms. XX, read and burst into tears of joy, she insisted that I "publicize it widely," and I also felt that this good deed should not be missed, so I washed my hands and added incense and specially transcribed it respectfully. Look, here is it:</p>
<p>Painting Hall Spring</p>
<p>The day starts long at the beginning of the year, guests come to comfort my desolation.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter if you occasionally pass the time, just play mahjong.</p>
<p>Drink all the wine in the glass, who cares about national affairs?</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are beauties in front of the wine vessel, but you can't be crazy.</p>
<p>Divination Ballad</p>
<p>The Northeast is severely cold, not as warm as Jiangnan;</p>
<p>The puppet state actually sees peace, how is it like the chaos in the Central Plains?</p>
<p>The "plenary meeting" was also held, but saving the country became a hanging case;</p>
<p>All the attending gentlemen got official positions, but no one cares about the national crisis.</p>
<p>One good deed has been done, and we continued to read on. Surprisingly, "things in the world are never unique," and we also discovered the "genius poetry" of a "genius" Shao. Naturally, this good deed is even more not to be missed. Without waiting for my wife's request, I automatically washed my hands again and respectfully transcribed the following:</p>
<p>Inscription on Liu Haisu's "Autumn Sunset"</p>
<p>On the afternoon of December 17, 1932, I visited the contemporary painter Mr. Liu Haisu at Songyun Villa. I was captivated at first sight and talked very happily. Mr. Liu praised Yu very much at the time, praising Yu with the word "genius," which I have been grateful for for a long time. I have been wandering around the world for many years, and I have been a down-and-out scholar. There are many who admire Yu, but few who understand Yu. Today I met Haisu, and I realized that I had met a confidant. The sympathy of artists is very different from that of ordinary people. After saying goodbye, I was exceptionally happy. The next day, I remembered Haisu's painting "Autumn Sunset" and took up my pen to inscribe it. Haisu read it, what do you think?</p>
<p>The red sun has a long face in the sky,</p>
<p>Pressing down on the shaking branches.</p>
<p>The river is like a coffin standing still.</p>
<p>The red sun becomes like a cloudy Mask,</p>
<p>The valley is like a bird at dusk,</p>
<p>Silently dragging a sigh.</p>
<p>Now that two good deeds have been done, I felt at ease and content. My wife suddenly exclaimed "Oh dear!" I asked, "Oh dear," what is it? She said: "You have done two good deeds, but you have harmed the typesetting workers for nothing, and you have also ruined such good paper. You are wasting things, and this sin is not small!" After she said this, I couldn't help but stick out my tongue in shock, so I spoke a slogan to record my fault. The poem says:</p>
<p>Amitabha Buddha is above, I am doing things really absurd!</p>
<p>People have long days, and they should pass the time by playing mahjong;</p>
<p>People don't have beauties in front of the wine vessel, who cares whether they can be crazy?</p>
<p>The river stands still like a coffin, the red sun becomes like a cloudy paste,</p>
<p>Haisu also praised him as a "genius," who dares to say that it is "not very similar"?</p>
<p>"The Times" is new, but you are old-fashioned, who cares, who cares!</p>
<p>Copying wonderful sentences is still forgivable, but harming the workers is wrong;</p>
<p>Harming the workers is still forgivable, but wasting paper is a loss of conscience!</p>
<p>Amitabha Buddha is above, I will never be absurd again.</p>
<h3 id="e241">Various Things After the Death of Galsworthy <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>According to Reuters news, the late British writer Galsworthy may have a state funeral held at Westminster Abbey in London. Although this is still a proposal, it can already be seen how the British view writers. Many of Galsworthy's friends, of course, are all well-known contemporary writers, and are now jointly requesting the authorities to approve this request. It seems that the authorities will not refuse.</p>
<p>Galsworthy also had a will when he was critically ill, which was to have his body cremated. His wife received a condolence telegram from the Emperor and Queen from Sandringham Palace the day after his death, saying that the Queen and her wife were deeply saddened by the news of his death and expressed their sincere sympathy to Mrs. Galsworthy. They deeply felt that Galsworthy's death was a great loss to the literary world, and the British people, both at home and abroad, would feel grief.</p>
<p>Prime Minister MacDonald also had a condolence telegram: "Please allow me to offer my deepest sympathy. His death is a permanently unfillable hole in the world of literature."</p>
<p>Two days before Galsworthy was critically ill, he finished the last chapter of the trilogy he wrote after "Maid" and "Flowering Wilderness," with a manuscript of about 100,000 words. Although it was all a first draft, people who knew Galsworthy's writing style knew that Galsworthy was so meticulous when writing that even the first draft did not require much revision. However, these drafts can only be seen by his closest relatives and friends. According to an employee of Heinemann Bookstore, which publishes most of his works: "Galsworthy's first draft is as exquisite as other writers' revised drafts."</p>
<p>As for the Nobel Prize for Literature that Galsworthy recently received, the amount is 9,600 pounds. According to Galsworthy's wishes, he wants to give it all to the PEN Club for safekeeping. If the PEN Club stops, it will be changed to the Royal Literary Society Fund. The PEN Club is a gathering of writers from all over the world, and Galsworthy himself is still the chairman.</p>

<p>He kept staring at Madam Ren's corner. He felt that tonight's Peizhen was particularly beautiful. This was not only because her clothes were fashionable, but also because her inherent posture was moving. Her figure was light, and she stood tall and jade-like, with an elegant element in her beauty. He felt that she "Do you know her? Go ask her to dance with you."</p>
<p>Madam Hezi's voice could be heard with a bit of jealousy.</p>
<p>"Nonsense!"</p>
<p>He turned his head and smiled at her.</p>
<p>He saw Peizhen, still being embraced by that tall and fat man, walking out. At this moment, Haiquan desperately paid attention to what kind of person that big man was. The more he paid attention, the more he felt that the giant's face was vulgar and his face was also very dark. The five fingers that were resting on Peizhen's shoulders seemed to be as thick and clumsy as some sugarcane in Guangdong. Haiquan paid more attention to his feet, which was even worse. Although they were wrapped in suit pants, it could be imagined that they were heavy and inflexible. Only the words "elephant legs" could describe them. He thought that the giant's legs must be straight and without any distinction between the thighs, knees, and shins. "Why does Madam Ren associate with such a giant? This giant is undoubtedly a first-class figure in China, a warlord!"</p>
<p>He thought to himself, and sighed softly.</p>
<p>Twenty-four</p>
<p>Before eleven o'clock, they returned home.</p>
<p>After about two or three days of sunshine and warmth, the weather changed. When they came out of the dance hall, they felt an unexpected and fierce northerly wind.</p>
<p>"It must be snowing."</p>
<p>As soon as he stepped into the back door, he said this as if to himself. But she didn't answer him. He didn't know why she was so unhappy. From the moment she came out of the dance hall, she was silent and didn't say a word. Every time he asked her a question, she would only smile slightly and not answer. This made it a little difficult for him to deal with. When he went upstairs, he thought she would definitely follow him. But in the living room below, it seemed that two or three Japanese guests had come and were sitting in front of the fireplace with that Oriental guy, talking happily. Only that beautiful little girl, when she heard that they had returned, ran out as if flying. When she saw Haiquan, she smiled charmingly and bowed as usual.</p>
<p>When Madam Hezi saw that guests had arrived, she hurried to the front hall. She didn't say a word to him, waiting for him to come up to see him.</p>

<h3 id="e243">How to Be a Person? <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— I</p>
<p>How to Be a Person?</p>
<p>This seems like a question that shouldn't be a question (last year, the editor of this publication, Mr. "Buddha," already spoke about it in detail), but to talk about it again might be very interesting.</p>
<p>People come in all shapes and sizes, and thus there are all sorts of rules for being a person, which are difficult to cover comprehensively. So, I will just briefly talk about how we people do it.</p>
<p>So, how are we doing it now? Very good. We respectfully follow the way of the sages and are worthy sons and grandsons of our great five-thousand-year-old ancient country. We would rather be so poor that we don't have food for three meals than become kidnappers. We would rather not have a single copper coin to buy a cigarette than pick up a cigarette butt on the street. We would rather be beaten black and blue by our wives, but it is not appropriate to openly flirt with other people's concubines. First, it is harmful to morality, and second, it is a matter of face. As for patriotism, we are even more serious. To show our determination not to buy inferior goods, we do not pass by the doors of such stores. To show our determination not to be slaves of a conquered nation, we glare at foreigners. Although this inevitably detracts from the gentlemanly demeanor, it is not a big deal.</p>
<p>However, upon careful consideration, it seems a bit wrong. After that, we can't help but start to doubt the way to conduct ourselves in the world. Of course, we must find another way. Although it is certainly unnecessary to become a robber or kidnapper, perhaps the principle of "small profits and quick turnover, sacrificing capital" in one's character might not be entirely impossible. So, we have to study the art of being a person in the future.</p>
<p>First, we have to get a conspicuous Western suit and learn a set of polite official phrases like "Thank you, thank you" and "You're too kind, you're too kind." Before high-ranking officials and nobles, we must be full of respect and reverence, congratulating them not only on their prosperous official career but also on how they benefit the country and its people. Before capitalists and landlords, in addition to not asking to borrow money or saying that they are rich and unkind, we must never show our own poverty and sourness. When their concubine celebrates her 20th birthday, even if it means using bandages for bound feet, we must send flower baskets or silver shields. If they go from Shanghai to Kunshan tomorrow, we must hold a banquet to see them off. If they go abroad, we must buy their boat tickets for them. When they write articles or give speeches, we must applaud and praise them. As for New Year's greetings and holiday visits, we must personally go to their door, which is the minimum requirement.</p>
<p>The above is for the big shots who are superior to us. As for the people whose economic status is below us, of course, we must put on an air of full of arrogance. When eating, there must be servants standing behind us; when taking a rickshaw, we must not haggle over the price; we must take first class on the tram; and when watching a play, we must go upstairs.</p>
<p>Thus, in this way, we will gradually squeeze into the upper class. Not only will it be no problem to watch racquetball and buy champagne tickets, but also in the autumn of national crisis when we "pacify the internal and then resist the external," in the time of "long-term resistance" and even "spiritual resistance," we might as well invent a kind of "eating to save the country," which will of course be a sensation. As for the business arena of actually selling out the country, why can't we take the opportunity to insert a foot in, using the philosophy that China is hopeless as an excuse?</p>
<p>Therefore, being a person is by no means difficult; it just depends on how earnestly you do it.</p>
<h3 id="e244">Petitioning and Asking for Leave <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Tan Yu</p>
<p>In the winter of the past year, students in Beiping braved wind and snow, lying on the rails to petition in Nanjing, demanding to send troops to resist Japan. Who didn't say they were enthusiastic and patriotic!</p>
<p>Now that the violent Japanese have occupied Yu Pass, and Tianjin and Peiping are in danger, this is precisely the time for them to petition. But the fact is exactly the opposite: they have asked for leave!</p>
<p>Alas! Enthusiasm! Patriotism! Is this the spirit of the Chinese nation! (Repaid) Science</p>
<h3 id="e245">The Evolution and Manufacturing of Light Bulbs <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Fan</p>
<p>Since Edison invented the light bulb, people all over the world have benefited from its light. However, when the light bulb was first invented, it used a lot of electricity, and the light was still dim. Only after many electrical scientists devoted themselves to hard work in the laboratory did we have today's light bulbs that are as bright as daylight.</p>
<p>Decades ago, our light bulbs were still very dim and yellowish. Because at that time, the filaments were made of carbon filaments, which were very expensive and not durable. Later, a metal called tungsten was invented for use as a filament, which was more energy-saving, brighter, and more durable than the previous carbon filaments. The commonly used long light bulbs on the market today are made of tungsten filaments. However, long light bulbs also have a shortcoming: because of the characteristics of tungsten filaments, they can secrete a gas after a long period of burning. This gas adheres to the light bulb, which is a yellowish substance. This yellowish substance can reduce the light and also detract from the appearance, so it is very annoying. Also, when this type of light bulb has been burning for a long time, the glass of the light bulb can transmit heat to the point where you can't put your hand on it, which is also one of the drawbacks.</p>
<p>We know that if we want the filament to glow, it must have a high temperature, so the inside of the light bulb is extremely hot, but we do not want the outside of the bulb to also generate high heat. So, another inventor came up with the idea of filling the light bulb with an inert gas, which had a significant effect: 1) The light bulb will not develop a yellowish substance after burning for a long time; 2) It will not transmit heat; 3) It saves more energy than tungsten filament lamps; 4) It is more durable than tungsten filament lamps. With these four major advantages, there is also a disadvantage: the price is more expensive than tungsten filament lamps. But compared to the advantages, the higher price is worth it. This lamp is originally called an inert gas lamp, but it is also called a Half lamp in the market, because "Half" means half, which means it can save half of the electricity.</p>
<h3 id="e246">Random Thoughts on the Year of the Abolished Lunar Calendar <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Jinmen</p>
<p>1.</p>
<p>Heaven is kind, and the weather has been sunny for days in the year of the abolished lunar calendar. All the cinemas and theaters are packed every day. The amusement parks are even more crowded. It can be said that people don't forget to have fun while saving the country. I think the owners of the amusement parks and theaters can make up for the losses they suffered last year during the "January 28th Incident" in one go this year.</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>Our people's conservatism is unmatched by any other country. Even though the government has long adopted the Gregorian calendar, the people still outwardly comply but inwardly resist, and have not been able to firmly abolish the abolished lunar calendar. Even such a simple and easy thing is like this. No wonder we lag behind in everything. Alas!</p>
<p>3.</p>
<p>On the anniversary of the "January 28th Incident," various newspapers published a notice from the Citizens' Federation: "...All amusement parks and theaters will suspend entertainment for one day to commemorate the event..." However, very, very few people actually followed it. Most places were still as crowded as usual. Of course, the theater owners are making full house these days, so how could they be willing to sacrifice the profits of this one day! Alas!</p>
<p>4.</p>
<p>On the anniversary of the "January 28th Incident," many shops hung half-masts at their doors, but inside they were banging drums. I don't know if they were in sorrow or in joy. Such a contradiction is laughable.</p>
<h3 id="e247">The Way Out for Shop Assistants' Communications <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>People living away from home, although there are various entertainment</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>places to spend their spare time, and like-minded friends to be companions for entertainment. But, at a certain time, there is always an indescribable "boredom" in my heart. Sir! I am one of them.</p>
<p>I have been away from my hometown to Shanghai for only more than two months. Every day, my life, honestly, cannot be considered unsatisfactory. There are opportunities to increase knowledge, and there is a possibility of contacting society. I am also interested in the business I serve. And there is one day off every week, where I can do other proper entertainment to adjust the monotony of life. In theory, this environment is exactly what most people seek but cannot get, so there is nothing more to ask for, right? However, people's hearts are never satisfied. In this environment, I am yearning for the so-called "boredom of my peers"! I want to find a friend of the opposite sex to satisfy my desires.</p>
<p>But, I must solemnly declare: The so-called "desire" is not the mean and ugly "carnal desire," and it is not difficult to satisfy one's "carnal desire" in the evil Shanghai. What I want to solve is only the indescribable "boredom."</p>
<p>I am a married man, and I get along very well with my wife. Because the living standards in Shanghai are high and she has her own environment, I cannot resolutely bring her to Shanghai: so I want to find an ideal friend of the opposite sex. But I dare not, I am afraid of falling into the net of love and being unable to get out; I am afraid that my ideal friend of the opposite sex will be criticized by society and be in a dilemma. Because I know that the flames of young men and women are strong, and they can burn together at first contact; at the same time, I know that today's society is in a transition between the old and the new, and the new trends and the old morals are fighting. It is easy for a woman to make friends with a man and cause social misunderstandings, or even become a victim of the times. But I cannot relieve my "boredom." The contradictory psychology has been tossing in my chest for more than a day, and I can't find a solution. Sir! Please teach me! Thank you. Di Ji, 22, 2, 5.</p>
<p>Editor's note: After reading Mr. Di's letter, we firmly believe that Mr. Di's "desire" in his heart is indeed "not the mean and ugly carnal desire," but only to solve the indescribable boredom." But how can there be anything "unspeakable" in the world? We dare to assert that this "boredom" is of course somewhat related to "sex." Otherwise, after already having "like-minded friends as companions for entertainment," why must you find "a friend of the opposite sex to satisfy my desires"? We believe that this demand for "desire" is very natural, and everyone does not need to avoid it, like Mr. Di, hiding and covering up, saying something like "indescribable boredom." According to physiology, the nutrients used by an adult every day become two kinds of power, one is "kinetic energy" and the other is "potential energy." "Kinetic energy" is the energy we spend on doing things every day; "potential energy" is hidden in our limbs and officials, ready to reproduce. So, whether male or female, after reaching a certain age, this "potential energy" acts up, and they need a partner of the opposite sex to fulfill their innate reproductive obligations. However, when there is no opponent, this "potential energy" has no place to be used, and it becomes what Mr. Di calls "indescribable boredom."</p>
<p>Therefore, when "sexual desire" is not resolved, it is indeed inevitable to confuse "love," "affection," and "desire" when interacting too closely with friends of the opposite sex. As for the deviations and dangers after entering such a wrong path, Mr. Di said it clearly and unambiguously in his letter, so we don't need to dwell on it. We suggest that Mr. Di quickly strive in the economic field, break the environment, and bring his beloved wife to Shanghai to live together. At that time, if you go to make some friends of the opposite sex, we can agree, but now we advise you not to try it. This is also a way to remove the fuel from the stove!</p>

<p>— Wang Zhongxian</p>
<p>7. Sand Blew into Her Eyes</p>
<p>Living in the large kitchen were Ruohua, Youzhong, and Miss Daiqiu. This play of uncle and sister-in-law in love, of course, could not be hidden from Daiqiu. When Daiqiu saw it, she felt indescribably sad. Ruohua was her mother, and she couldn't protect her, she just hated Youzhong to the bone.</p>
<p>In the past, Daiqiu and Youzhong had the best feelings. She once said to him: "Why do I have to call you uncle? This is such a distant address! Wouldn't it be more intimate if I called you brother?"</p>
<p>Youzhong said to her: "When no one is listening, you can call me brother as much as you like. I am only twenty-three years old, and I am secretly willing to call you sister."</p>
<p>Youzhong often bought things to give her, and she also often hid from her mother and asked Youzhong to buy things. The two of them often hid in a room to talk, but no one knew what they were talking about.</p>
<p>Since discovering that Youzhong and her mother had immoral behavior, she had been sulking and refusing to eat. Her mother asked her why she didn't eat, and she said that she was seasick and had a headache; Youzhong asked her, and she pursed her lips all the way down to her chin. Youzhong avoided Ruohua's eyes and ears, and still like usual, went over to hold her hand, wanting to talk to her. She exerted herself to fling his hand away, turned her face to the window and looked at the turbulent sea.</p>
<p>"What are you angry about with me?" Youzhong asked gently.</p>
<p>Daiqiu ignored him a hundred times, and Youzhong kept asking. She drew a line downward with her palm, indicating that she was breaking off all relations with him. He still kept pestering her. So she resolutely replied:</p>
<p>"You are a dirty person. From now on, don't talk to me again! I'll pretend you're dead, and you pretend I'm dead!"</p>
<p>Hearing these words, which were more sour than pickled green plums, Youzhong's heart was as bright as if he had eaten fireflies. But, she was only a fifteen-year-old girl, how could she have such great jealousy? How could she understand the privacy of men and women? And also have the ambition to monopolize a handsome man? Probably the progress of the world is too fast, and the development of women is also particularly accelerated, and even underage girls know how to be jealous.</p>
<p>To say another word of conscience, Youzhong certainly never dreamed that his niece Daiqiu would fall in love with him. When they first met, she was only twelve years old, and it can be said that he watched her grow up. In these three years, he really loved her!! He hugged her willow-like waist, he kissed her apple-like cheeks! 丨However, these are definitely not expressions of erotic love. Everyone is happy to see a smart and beautiful child, even the old uncles with beards, hugging a little girl of about ten years old, and the old ladies with bald heads kissing a child with just erupted teeth, no one will turn their head askew and think of the issue of sex. Youzhong's love for Daiqiu is also like this.</p>
