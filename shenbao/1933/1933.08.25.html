<p>意大利黑衣宰相墨索里尼。與奥總揆杜爾夫斯會談之結果。雖秘密不宣。但據一般政治家之推測。大約不外以經濟爲基幹。而以政治爲輔。換言之。即溝通德意奥匈之關係。與法國所領導之「凡爾賽體系」相抗衡是也。何以言之。意大得天産貧乏。其鐵鑛出産量。不過德國十分之一。石炭産量亦甚微。而今日産業上及軍備上所必不可缺之石油。意大利本國幾至一滴俱無。工業上差可在世界立足者。惟人造絲一項而已。以此區區烏能稱雄世界。爭霸歐洲也哉。然而意大利。固時時欲與法蘭西平分歐洲大陸之支配權。欲獨攬地中海以制服北非。併欲將亞德得亞海收爲其内海。但在今日旣缺適當之軍港。沿亞德利亞海　延四百餘里之海岸。幾全屬沙灘。絶無可以開闢港灣之地。而對岸之猶哥斯拉夫所屬塔爾馬担亞海岸。類皆斷崖絶壁。面海背山自成形勝。可以駐軍艦。可以停商船之處。不下十數。此巴黎和會中鄧南遮之所以運用民族利益而以武力占領「伍由買」也。現在意大利旣爲法西斯　國家之前鋒。又爲歐洲覇者之一。埀涎其對岸諸港灣。殆巳無可隠諱。是以墨索里尼與麥唐納會談之後。四强公約未成立之前。英國即有同意於意大利領有塔爾馬提亞海岸之傳說也。</p>
<p>無如法蘭西盡力支撑凡爾賽條約。一心维護其覇權。保持中歐各小國現時國境。其用意亦即所以制限意大利之突飛。防止德國軍國主義之膨脹。德意窥見此種情勢。遂亦愈加促進兩國間之諒解。修改「凡爾賽和約」之聲浪。高但入雲。中歐空氣。乃更漸趨緊張。大有非戰爭不能解决之勢矣。</p>
<p>至於德奥之關係。自聖潔門對奥講各條約成立以後。奥大利土地日削。北扼於「捷克。」南制於「猶哥。」而人口稠密。维也納一城。現時人口已至二百萬。占全奥人民三分之一農業限於地域無可展。工業苦無原料。匈牙利亦同此情勢。其講和條約。不啻宣告奥匈之死刑。最少亦可謂爲加以鐐拷。絶無轉動餘地。故除與德國合併或甘作附庸外。絶無生存之可能。此兩年前德奥關稅同盟提倡之初。德奥合併之說即隨之而起也。德國在此風雨飄颻之際。固其希望有國附間之助力。其後遭受外力阻擾。合併雖不能成。而兩國之關係。依舊密切。蓋在政治上經濟上有不能不互相結合之勢。然則今日奥大利何以又阻止希特勒黨在奥活動。且進而親近意大利。其原因又何在。</p>
<p>德國自希特勒取得政權以來。激於愛國主義。肆力排擠猶太人。而惟德意志民族是尊。隣近小國如匈如奥。見此情形。不能不心懷疑懼。國家主義極度發達而後。惟有行侵略。德國在過去歷史上表現。已極明顯。至於德意合作。僅爲一時的利害關係。設令法國能再對德讓步。修改或廢棄「凡爾賽和約。」德國有擴張軍備之機會者。德意兩國之矛盾。必將顯著。奥大利界乎兩大之間。審度時勢。熟權利害以爲意大利之惡意。或較德國爲少。而意奥經濟關係。又復易於合作。是以意德奥匈四國經濟同盟之中心。勢將由德國而移轉於意大利矣。此後歐歐際間形勢之對立。將愈趨尖氏銳。固無可疑也。</p>

<p>否認政府外交政策變更說</p>
<p>蔣作賓公使暫將不願回任</p>
<p>財宋或過日酬酢未接電告</p>
<p>新任外交部常務次長唐有壬、昨晨八時、偕汪院長夫人陳璧君女士、鐵道部長曾仲鳴、由京乘夜車來滬、昨晨十時、唐氏在寓次、接見各報社記得者、堅决否認中央外交方針變更之說、復謂蔣作賓公使、暫不東渡回任云、唐偕曾仲鳴·于右任·張之江等、均於昨晚、乘夜車晋京、茲將唐氏談話、分述如次</p>

<p>京滬連日盛傳中央外交方針、有所變更云云、唐氏堅决否認此說、據唐氏談、羅部長决於明日（二十五日）首途赴新、在羅部長出巡期内、外交部務暫由汪院長兼署、但中央之對外方針、一仍舊賞、並不變更、至於本人日前往訪日本駐華公使有吉明氏、完全係屬駇人應酬性質、並無任何任務、蓋日使前曾來京過訪、本人上週乘返滬之便、乃往日使館一行、答訪有吉公使、</p>

<p>關於駐日公使蔣作賓回任問題、在廬山會議時、有人請蔣氏早日返任、但蔣氏本人之意、暫時尙不願回任、故外傳蔣氏即將由廬山返滬、下月初旬東渡回任諸說、並非事實、</p>

<p>對郵局裁員事</p>
<p>郵政當局、以目前郵政虧損、设法彌補、定於本年九月一日起將全國資深人員三十餘員、實行强制裁退、此事已引起郵務兩會反對堅决、昨據郵務兩會某常委等、發表負責谈話云、郵局經濟虧損、最大原因、由於儲匯局之分立、航空公司之津貼、及交通部解欵之漫無限制、本兩會鑒於事態之嚴重、長此以往、郵政經濟、將瀕破産、　於去年詳審郵政經濟虧損原因、擬具鞏固郵基方案、並採罷工手段、以求實施、當由政府代表、地方領袖、接受原則、並於本年五月、由郵政經濟制度研究委員會、擬具實施綱要、建議當局、採納施行、然直至今日、　　局分立如故、航空公司津貼、於過去半年間、已達三十餘萬元、至於解部欵項、本爲每月三萬元、儲匯局分立後、每月增加三萬元、去年護郵運動後、每月又增加三萬元、試思如此竭澤而漁、郵政經濟狀况、安得不每况愈下、在此情形之下、郵政當局、忽捨本逐末、强迫　退一部份人員、並將養老基金補助金、按全國員工薪水總數百分之七者、改爲百分之五、查郵政員工進局、均經考試、任職受有保障、並無强迫裁退之先例、據郵政總局第二六七六八八○三號訓令稱、该員等服務已久、比較年老力衰、而辦事亦復平庸、成績不良、然該被裁人員、年齡均在五十二三左右、照章可服務至六十歲、年旣未老、體格頗强、力亦未衰、所擔任者、又均屬重要職務、並無隕越可知、辦事並不平庸、成績報告均屬優良、所謂不良、不攻自破、當局以莫須有事故、强迫裁退、員工職位、毫無保障、人存自危之心、郵政效能、必大受影響、又養老金制度、至良且善、郵政員工、所以忠勤自勉者、皆以將來退休後、養老有資脫境不愁、今郵政當局、將補助金减低百分之二、此事一行、結果養老金必見動摇、人心恐慌、郵政良好制度、行見紊亂、本兩會爲受護郵政計、自此事發生後、本委曲求全之旨、輒與部方磋商、以求妥善辦法、部方表示頗見緩和、不意郵政　局局長黃乃樞、一意孤行、橫加阻梗、殊不知是何居心、如必欲破壞郵政制度、　削員工之利益者、本兩會當以全力與之週旋云、</p>

<p>最近擬設法實行播音檢查</p>
<p>本市無線電台、以商辦者多於官辦、而其間頗多不受交通部節制者、即各電台間亦彼此不通聲氣、故時有兩電台間之音波、發生混亂衝突交通部有鑑及此、乃實行無線電統制、其第一步爲先使各電台實行登記、第二步由交通部校正各電台之音波、第三步則爲審查各電台之播音内容、現在第一第二兩步、業已辦到、至於第三步則因手續麻煩、尙在準備中、茲將其詳情分誌如下</p>

<p>交通部對此事之第一步計劃、即令各商用無線電台舉行登記、以便著手進行、嗣後工作、現在各無線電台、均已遵令、雖租界上之電台、亦均前往登記、至於洋商電台、自經交部與之接洽後、完全遵照辦理、與中國電台同受部中節制、</p>

<p>當未登記前、各電台播音、均不甚統一、且有違反國際電台章程者、因國際方面規定、我國所用電台播音號碼爲ＸＧ·而有少數電台、則用ＸＣ·該項號碼、爲墨西哥國所</p>
<p>用、我國實不能用、又有數外國電台播音號碼、竟爲ＩＵＯＫ·此種遊戲播音、實非應用、自向交通部登記後、部中已令各電台禁用此種越軌之號碼、刻已完全取締矣、</p>

<p>交通部又因各無綫電臺送來所播消息、多有诲淫及妨礙風化之歌曲、予市民以不良之印象、無綫電原爲傳播文化之器具、如此則與原則相背、故擬辦理檢查、使各無綫電臺於播音前、先將播音之節目、及時呈交部檢查、則不特可免除流弊、且可使各電臺播音時間不受衝突、此事現方在籌備、大槪可於短期間實現云、</p>

<h3 id="c142">市衛生局建設吳淞鄉村衛生模範區 <a href="#c142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>建築治療機關便利鄉民求醫</p>
<p>灌注衛生知識增進農民健康</p>
<p>市衛生局鑒於衛生、關係農村經濟之復興至鉅、對於本市鄉村區域之衛生設施、莫不積極進行、最近復劃定吳淞爲本市鄉村衛生模範區指撥經費、積極建設、雖創辦伊始、已得相當效果、茲將詳情、分誌如下、</p>
<h3 id="c143">建設模範區之動機 <a href="#c143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>在一二八戰事發生前、市衛局卽在吴淞方面设有衛生事務所、及吳淞鄉村衛生模範區辦事處各一所、醫務設備方面、則有海濱醫院、及上海醫學院二處、旋以戰事爆發、醫院及校址、均被燬於砲火、致一切衛生行政、均無形停頓、停戰後、衛生局方面、以吳淞戰區受損極鉅、更有積極恢復各項衛生設備之必要、同時同濟醫學院、亦向市府請求、願共同合作、俾該校公共衛生系學生、可以在此實習、而借此機會、深入農村、努力鄉村衛生運動、當經市府通過、並議决所有建設經費、由衛生局同濟醫學院共同負担第一期經費、巳規定爲四萬元、並决定在吳淞區内、實行普遍衛生敎育及衛生設施運動、並指定該區爲鄉村衛生模範區、俾將來依此推廣</p>
<h3 id="c144">衛生事務所將落成 <a href="#c144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>當一二八戰事停止後、所有吳淞區内之醫治機關多爲砲火所燬、吳淞數十萬之農民、均感患病無處醫治之痛苦、市衛生局有鑒及此、曾一度设置巡迴診療汽車、隨時分别馳赴各村落及居民蝟集處所、予以求醫之便利、但以求醫人數遇多、頗難應付、乃感覺有設立大規模治療所之必要、復由衛生局會同同濟醫學院、集資在海濱醫院舊址、建造吳淞衛生區事務所、業於七月一日舉行奠基禮、下月中旬、卽可全部落成、内部將設置治療等各部、在正式所址未完成以前、暫借同濟醫學院一部份校址辦公、並聘請公共衛生專家李宣果爲該所主任、由衛生局派技士李玉仁爲副主任、卽以該所爲中心、逐步實施鄉村衛生敎育之建設與宣傳、該所工作進行、雖屬初步、然已獲得相當效果、計七月份中、所經就治人數、業已近千、在夏令期中、對於各種防疫工作、亦均有顯著之成績、</p>
<h3 id="c145">實施鄉村衛生敎育 <a href="#c145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>復興農村、爲我國目前内政最要之設施、而農村經濟之復興、與農民衛生問題、關係極爲重大、蓋無健康之農民、則農村一切將無由進步、衛生局對建設吳淞鄉村衛生模範區之主要目的、除代農民診治疾病外、其最大任務、在領導農民、對衛生建設加以注意、而以衛生敎育及提高農民衛生智識爲最後之目的、聞其初步實施方法、將分三點着手、㈠實行訪問治療、特派遣看護及醫學院實習學生、向有病人之農民家庭中、代爲診治、並隨時輸以衛生常識、㈡當病人來所求治時、隨機應變、對衛生敎育方面、加以指示、並使其對指導機關、</p>
<p>發生信仰、㈢公開宣傳、印刷衛生宣傳品、公開衛生演講、舉行鄉村衛生運動等、此外如舉行檢騐體格、敎以科學方法、驅除害蟲、俾使區内農民、日趨於健全、</p>
<h3 id="c146">指導區内工廠衛生 <a href="#c146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>吳淞區内工廠林立、該所除努力於鄉村及學校外、同時對各工廠内之衛生設備、亦加以注意、因工廠衛生、較一般尤爲重要、聞该所最近已在準備一切、將於下月起、對區内各工廠衛生狀况、先加以縝密調查、並隨時派員前赴各廠、加以指導、如有不妥善者、隨時加以糾正以避免各種危險、而增進勞工之健康云、</p>
<h3 id="c147">兩路吳淞機廠怠工實况 <a href="#c147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>翻砂部工作迄未恢復</p>
<p>大白社云、兩路管理局吳淞機廠工人、對於翻砂部工作、時有發生糾紛迭次請求取銷包工制、工會方面、曾於本年三月間、據情呈請路局核辦、迄今數月、並不見復、於八月初又因翻砂部工作淸淡、擬將實行减工制度、以减輕包工頭之負担、乃引起全廠工友之注意、於是該會召集組長聯度會議、提出討論、僉以該包工頭如一日不取銷、恐將來有波及全廠之勢、遂議决限十日内請求撤銷包工制、否則由全廠工友、一致援助該部工友、作相當應付、一面當卽函知吳淞廠長、及包工頭單榮生、一面呈請工會理事會轉呈路局限期撤銷、然未經十日、該翻砂部風潮尙未解决之時、路局又因趕造平滬通車之餐車臥車等、與木匠部工頭韓則佩接治承包、事爲全廠工人报悉、以路局一意企圖恢復包工制度、未知用意何在、在翻砂部風潮尙未解决、今又欲於木匠部試用包工制、衆心憤激、遂於星期一（二十一日）晨、實行怠工、并因言語衝突、互相毆打、工會得訊、卽派員前往制止、但已傷及工友二名、是日下午、工會理事會因恐事態擴大、特由常務理事陳伯華前往调查制止、惟是日路局並未派員前往、故無結果而散、翌晨（星期二）繼續怠工、至下午三時許、局方始派袁伯揚、偕同黨部委員陳承栻等、前往勸解、並接受工方要求、各工人遂認爲滿意而散、現木工部之包工制實行取消、故工人已照常工作、翻砂部取消包工原則、雖經路局接受、然須俟該部工友申述理由、再行核辦、故該部工作至今尙未恢復、關於此點、於二十三日晨、曾由黨部委員陳承栻率領工友代表二十餘人、向局方接洽後、方由陳承栻會同該廠工友重要份子、擬具辦法後、再供獻路局採納施行、惟此次該廠怠工以來损失甚大、每日竟達五千元之鉅、若不從速解决、其損失實屬不貲也云云、</p>
<h3 id="c148">市民呈請承辦滬南公共汽車 <a href="#c148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>市當局尙在考慮中</p>
<p>本市滬南區交通、除有各路電車行驶外、以前尙有滬南公共汽車、惟自一二八案發生後、滬南公共汽車公司虧本過鉅、無法維持、乃宣告停業、但邇來市面巳恢復如舊、爰有李曉滄等呈請市公用局承辦行駛公共汽車、惟爲審愼起見、將先開行自西門至龍華及圜城圓路兩綫、規定資本二十萬元、實收十萬、並將訂購德國新式朋馳牌柴油汽車十四輛、如營業得有起色、將再謀擴充、但據另訊、市府對於滬南行駛公共汽車、或將收歸市辦、則此說是否可以實現、尙須經各方之考慮、</p>

<p>葡總領事在開庭時、先詢充任救火會會員之葡人皮狄賴、蓋皮居嘉興路二十二號與行兇之十五號屋適爲對門、皮狄賴供、十五號屋先一西人租住、後見該西人與一中國女子口角、而發生毆打、葡領即令皮在兩被告吕指認、而皮狄賴即指出巴德列爲毆打之行兇人、葡領又詢毆打時爾目覩否、皮言親之、</p>
<h3 id="c152">屍箱認定 <a href="#c152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>葡領又傳匯山碼頭七號小工訊問、八月五日裝屍鐵箱、何人送到碼頭、是西人抑係華人、該工人供、係一西裝少年裝來、但籍貫面貌、當時未加經意、故已忘懷、惟當時運箱者曾給我小洋二角、迨葡領令認兩被告時、該小工以難以辦識答之、惟箱子則確屬不錯、</p>
<h3 id="c153">搬屍經過 <a href="#c153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>

<p>倫敦特約通信一志寄</p>
<p>七月三日（星期一）</p>
<p>（七月二日星期日停賽）今日安靜空氣、籠罩各部各處、星期六滿坑滿谷之塲地、已不再見、皇婦貴族、亦未蒞臨、比賽亦未生意外、天時仍繼續晴朗、卽氣象報告處亦表示樂觀、屈指已九日不雨、今日爲第十日矣、今日爲第二星期之開始、氣候殊熱、倫敦之寒暑表、升至八十四度、日中更熱、在塲及離塲者、皆流汗、咸以陰凉處爲舒服、惠勃爾登之草地、久旱需雨、足立其下、安穏毫不覺其溜滑、在中央塲上、克勞福之勝休斯、如爲怒潮狂捲以去、斯已不見前日勝賽德時之勇、惟若花瓶匠手中之泥而已、克勞福則精細、自滿、安閒、輕快、抱有可羡慕之管束力、表演其更進步之網球、重壓攔殺、随心怕欲、在第一第二兩盤、皆連勝五局、而放棄一局、在第三盤休斯漸復平態、以四比二局佔先、但結果仍爲此澳洲選手以七比五所屈服、克勞福之得勝、自在意中、但不料若是之懸殊也、</p>
<p>史篤芬疲乏若一半殘廢之人、能勝柯顯第　盤、第二盤亦曾下死戰、良可嘉許、史爲其障礙所束縛、手指受傷、太感不便、最後以顧慮而失敗、史以有力之發球、　壓柯顯、但其錯誤卽在球出後、不在底絑守候較弱之回球、而隨卽跟進上網、柯顯殊現慌亂、鬆弛而無力、逐漸回復其原狀、錯誤甚多、令人疑異、其最近之兩塲比賽、顯示特殊進步、其次對梵恩斯之大戰、將爲其莫大試煉、在第四盤中、對手如若無人、史篤芬得勝一局而已、</p>
<p>英國第一名女選手希　女士（右）販於馬迪夫人（左）</p>
<p>孟瑞爾與梵恩斯、劇戰四盤、大半在守禦線上、其輕快之對角抽與其上網後之壓殺、相互交替此賽在中央塲舉行、孟瑞爾以六比三勝第三盤此賽在中央塲舉行、孟瑞爾以六比三勝第三盤但絶不似一能最後得勝者、比賽安靜過去梵恩斯一望而知未曾盡用其力、常改變其擊法、如輪流試騐其各種擊法者、有時任其所之、若祇欲確擊愈佳、時鬆時緊、使對方無從捉摸、</p>
<p>梵恩斯以六比一勝第一盤、如表演網球應如何擊法者、孟瑞爾亦並不若比數顯示之軟奸、孟因跳動而足誤、阻礙其發球、旣破孟之發球成四比一、梵已達最高峯、而不再使用其最高速度之抽球、使孟無從回答、</p>
<p>二盤梵恩斯更爲温和、各四後擊落孟之發球、再勝其自己者、梵如在展覽會中、梵放棄第三盤、第四盤再度加緊、得四比一、而以六比三獲勝、梵在比賽中、似若有所深思者、但精神甚佳、一次擊落孟之發球得一分、而堅持必須重發、蓋爲一觸帶球也、孟較梵爲怕熱、仰慕梵之得勝不已、有時球未至而已先出其　美之聲者一年之前、在一不似今日之乾燥與堅實之塲地上、奥斯汀擊敗佐藤、今日則事物大變、奥斯汀在連失一二兩盤後、已無力再　遠其欠欵、第一盤奥曾破發球、而得一線希望、但佐藤以壓力回答之而以七比五攫得、第二盤佐藤捷足先登、加緊速度、以六比三再勝、佐藤因取之太易、在表示滿足、結果奥以小心有力之球、以六比二勝第三盤、咸如是小心、冒險者常遭失敗、終於奥之發球、得第四盤、更可注意者、操縱局面之抽球皆不深而少步法、</p>
<p>比賽旣成平等局面、受剌　後之佐藤、開始對將倒而尙在扎掙之奥斯汀、先以四比二居先、發球得力、戰成五比二、在最後分勝負臨了一局之最後一分、奥斯汀盡傾其力、平等者二次、佐藤卒以有力之一記抽球六比二告勝、</p>
<p>此塲旣無動人可觀處、亦少有力之火氣、但爲穏健、留意、有腦力之比賽、在第四盤中、佐藤並非全不留意其復原之力較奥爲大耳、在第五盤中能及早用其壓力、中央塲看座客滿、皆希望英人得勝、但精神殊佳、亦予佐藤以充份鼓掌</p>
<p>巴育夫人、六比四、六比一、此瑞士女子因集中力量之結果、曾一連串得勝三局、亦有表示驚奇者、但馬迪夫人似乎在炎熱之天氣中、顯露不耐煩、而任其所之者、退後而守、造成幾許不必有之錯誤、在第二盤中、巴育之力已盡、無抵抗而屈服、</p>
<p>斯與勃惠爾對老將鮑羅屈拉與勃魯寗、第二盤以六比二打成平手、似乎有一希望、展開新局面、鮑之蹂　一切之球、與莫明其妙之失誤相混合、勃魯寗之過頭殺球、亦少把　握斯之發球旣常得分、而勃惠爾亦搭配熨貼、因此似乎有繼續勝利之希望、但渐陷於錯誤、　斯更甚、法　乘此進步、以兩個六比四勝利、</p>
<p>在外塲高弗列夫人米克爾夫人以七比五七比五勝史克列文女士與西茄夫人、爲一特殊比賽、更在雙打比賽中、尙須再加探討、其姿勢不佳、西茄則缺少一重要之力量、高米之勝爲應得者、混合雙打在比賽進行中、但未有值得注意者、</p>

<h3 id="c232">腿之謎 <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>腿，是人人有的，然而，腿的應用不同。吾想：警察先的腿，是電桿木變的；郵局使者的脚，是園中竹子變的；黃包車夫的脚，是兩根鼓搥變的；財閥富豪的脚，是全副壽板變的；這四個便是腿之謎。</p>
<p>第一謎，是很容易猜的；警察站崗，兩條腿卓立不動，差不多是電桿木的　形，所以說是電桿木變的。</p>
<p>第二謎，郵差的腿，和園中的竹子，當然有幾分相同之點。竹是報平安的，郵差的腿，也負着報告平安的使命；這是性質上的相同。竹子，是　着绿色的竹筠，郵差的腿，也裹着绿色的腿布，這是形式上的相同。</p>
<p>第三謎，黃包車夫拉車飛跑的時候，都在那　脚打屁股，雖然没有打到屁股上，但是，相差很不遠了。屁股成了鼓，他的兩腿便成有了兩根鼓搥，所以說是鼓搥變的。</p>
<p>第四謎，財閥富豪的兩腿，绝少應用的時候。他坐在家裏，要什麽東西，不須勞動他的尊腿，只須捺一捺電鈴，要茶便是茶，要酒便是酒，姨太太來了，僕婢們也來了。逢到出門，他的兩腿總放在汽車裏面，更不用僕僕往來。這兩條絶少勞動的尊腿，大可貼上兩條紅紙標語，標語用什麽字樣？儘可仿着全副壽板上面所貼的字樣呌做：備而不用。</p>
<h3 id="c233">黃白黑 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 賢賢</p>
<p>白人，是天之驕子，是這個世界上的統治者。黑人，是上帝特意創造着供白人做奴隷的，祖而父，子而孫，老是受白人的統治。這是誰都不能怪誰的，怪只怪在那一張皮色上有了分别。</p>
<p>白人，黑人之外，還有我們這些白不白，黑不黑，酌乎其中的黃人，眞是尷尬。</p>
<p>在前些時，時髦男女，眼睄着白人白得不可一世，於是大家想把從老子娘胎裏帶出來的那張黃皮膚，用人工改造成白色，冒充一下子统治階級的白人。臉上，手上，每天塗上半斤雪花膏之外，還得堆上一厚　白粉，活像戲臺上跑出來的曹孟德。但是隨你化裝到如何程度，就是臉上塗一層白漆，終究仍舊是一個黃人，而冒充不成白人的。這雖然是十分遺憾的事，但這是上帝創造得如此的，牛吃稻柴鴨吃榖，誰都眼紅不了誰　這一程子，時髦男女，一變而爲摩登男女，於是對於染膚術，也都改變了作風，竸尙黑化。本來是蠟黃的皮膚，經了若干年雪花膏與粉的醃漬，逐漸地把皮膚變白了百分之一，如今忽然地一大批，一大批的趕到高橋海水浴塲去，醮着海水，躺在沙灘上，任着一百度左右的日光，把一身不雅觀的黃皮膚，蒸晒得由黃而由褐而黑，黑得印度人望而却步，尼格羅甘拜下風，那才算黑得美不可言。</p>
<p>從前要做黃底的白人，猶還情有可原，爲的是想從半殖民地的準奴隷地位，一躍而爲統治者。畫虎數十年，一無成就，如今忽然想做起黃底的黑人來了，眞不知是安着甚麽心思，難不成準奴隷做得不爽脆，索性再進一步，而求爲白人的正式奴隷麽。</p>
<p>我看黃底的黑人，也不見得比正式的黑人吃香，我們還是跟着高麗，滿洲，做黃人的奴隷罷。</p>

<p>— 方志誠</p>
<p>近幾月來，我常聽到節制女子家事學校的消息，這不但惹起了我的好奇心，我爲補救伊的失學，正有找到這麽一個學校的需要。但是，爲愼重起見，我便先去參觀，校址在江灣翔殷路口，那天，我走進學校門，把名片遞進去，一會兒，一位衣裝很簡樸的中年女子出來了，伊和藹地向我點了頭，我便把來意說了一番。伊說：「承參觀敝校，我們很歡迎，請進來吧！」伊一面講，一面把手向前面指。我便同伊上了石階，進了樓房，向右是一間極淸潔的會客室，據說桌上所鋪的檯布都是學生們自己　的。這會客室的後而是樓梯。向左是一間課室。敎員正在敎課，敎的是新法保婴。後面是一個大敎室，有三十餘學生在那裏预備菌課，我站在那裏，伊們一點也不介意。後來我們上了二樓，那裏有六間大小的房間，一間是撫嬰習騐室，一間是實習嬰兒園，其餘的是敎室，缝衣及剌繡間。三樓是敎員的寢室。向後走，我們就到了廚房和飯廳，那時在廚房裏，正有幾個穿了白圍裙的少女在那裏炊飯，經那位女敎員介紹之後，我便說「你們的圍裙真淸雅！」伊們毫不羞澀，其中一位說：「這就是我們自製的制服呢。」那位招待員微笑地向我說：「這裏我們本不准男子參觀的，不過先生旣有女親來念書，我們就破個例罷！」我謝謝伊幾句，我們又到了那些简單，但是極淸潔的臥室，在我臨走的時候，伊又告訴我：「本校是婦女節制恊會所創辦的，宗旨是：㈠培豢健全的母性，㈡訓練一般刻苦耐勞的女子，將來去作農村婦女解放運動，或到都會裏人家去作管理員；㈢爲貧窮人家的女兒造成求學的機會，及補救一班失學的女子。我覺得這個學校辦理得法，内容優美，所以特地介紹給讀者，並貢獻與有志研究家政的女子們。（却酬）</p>

<p>— 夏天吾</p>
<p>「午睡，」一般人說法呌做「打中覺」。實在炎炎長夏，侂短晝長，人們在白天忙了一天，到了晚上，還是得不到好睡。　如，貧窮的人，與蚊蚋臭蟲爲敵，肉捕終宵；中層階級，設備不起電扇冷氣，苦熱　蒸，揮扇不已，决不能一　睡到天亮；富貴人在夜間是逍遥世界，跳舞塲，電影院，大飯店┆┆</p>
<p>所以在夏季，無論上中下三層階級中的人，都不會在夜裏有充足的睡眠。</p>
<p>夜間睡眠不足，白天就要覺得勞倦，更是中午酷熱，街上的情景也靜寂些，飯飽茶足，靜坐一隅，「讀書已覺眉稜重，就枕方欣骨節和，」二重眼皮自然受的話，那麽有人在中午有一次「打中覺」的時間，也算不易得幸福了。</p>
<p>這裏有詩二首，眞是十足的］說出「打中覺的甜味：</p>
<p>「相待蒲團睡味長，主人與客兩相忘。須臾客去主人覺，一半西窗無夕陽。」丨丨陸放翁。</p>
<p>「紙屏瓦枕竹方床，手抛卷書午夢長。睡起莞然　獨笑，數聲漁笛在滄浪。」丨丨蔡持正。</p>
<p>學校在夏委所以要放暑假，我可說，大原因爲了學生在課堂上要「打瞌睡，」不然，如果暑期裏一般的照平常上課，一定三分之二光陰在「打瞌睡」中消耗了　　如果人是有這般的幸福，在夏天能每午打上一個「中覺，」也不能处算是懒惰；因爲這是生理上的作用。馬相伯老人曾說：「我之養生，亦並無何等奇妙方法，每日飲食有節制，午飯之後，閉目靜坐，摒除雜思，假寐一時┆┆「」可見「打中覺」還是件衛生要訣。單直的看起來似乎每天廢上一時「打中覺」的時間很不經濟：但在大體上看，人生壽命延長，就補足了那每天所費去的。所以「打中覺」却是經濟的年益壽法。</p>

<h3 id="c238">黃河之水天上來 <a href="#c238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>唐潮那位大詩人留下「黃河之水天上來」的名句，這是那的。黃河之水天上來，呌我們有麽辦法呢？盡人事以待天命，牠要從北邊白相到南什邊，只好聽牠的尊便了。不是蛇大王今年又出世了嗎？黃河决口，此中蓋有天意。古往今來，　黃河的，惟有這句詩最爲徹底；李靑蓮眞愧爲詩仙。</p>
<p>待天命派的黃河專家，自由談没有這許多篇幅來给我排道統；文獻不足徴，也有些地方接不上去。不過「河工夫役，州縣取之里甲，里甲視甲資爲出夫之等，一家雇夫五名，則月費十金，　産資子，閭閻一空。及夫至工，百計索求，致令逃去，檄移雇補，費復如前。官徒有募夫之名，而害歸於藉名者之家，利歸於管工者之手。」（明萬唇間禮部主事陳應芳奏。）這種靠黃河的心法，一線相傳，於今未隨。史載從嘉慶二年七月到二十四年八月，黃河决口十七次；十三年那一年，决了三次口；就只嘉慶十三十四兩年，南河修堵，費四千餘萬；河臣「濫　侵漁，　費無算；軍餉以外，此爲大宗。」</p>
<p>待　了天命，那就该盡人事派出力了。盡人事派奉大禹爲不祧之祖，大禹以下就分賈讓派，王景派；　　治河三策，主不與河爭地，「今行上策，徒冀州之民，當水　者，决黎陽，遮害　，使北入海。┆┆如出數年治河之費，以業所徒之民；此功一立，河定民安。」王景派治法，與賈讓正相反，主張抑洪水，說是從禹貢「播爲九河，同爲逆河」的「播」「同」兩個字上悟出來的。大槪從東漢以後，治河策上就有不爭地的賈學和抑洪水的王學，賈事行了一些時，黃河之水還是天上來，就改用王學；王學行了一些時，黃河之水仍是天上來，又改用　學；不過史臣總是說用了某學，黃河之水有許多時候不從天上來，以見人事之當盡。</p>
<p>順治十五年，河决山陽；康熙元年，河决原武祥符；康熙十六年，河水四溢，以靳輔爲河道總督，靳輔創蓄淸敵黃，束水攻沙之法。可是撫臣干成龍謂下河宜挑不宜停，重堤宜停不宜築，和靳輔意見不合。其時，延臣贊成靳輔之議，而康熙左袒于成龍，築堤派是朱敗的。大槪築堤派和反築堤派對康熙皇帝盡了一番人事，到了嘉慶年間待了一番天命，至咸豐五年，河決　瓦廂，牠老人家又白相到北邊去了！</p>
<p>現在不是黃河之水双天上來了嗎？盡人事乎？待天命乎？盡人事以待天命乎？所以古往今來，論黃河的，惟有李靑蓮這詩句說得最徹底，賈學王學之外，應該别開李學。</p>

<p>— 何如</p>
<p>文壇登龍旣有其術，復有其書矣。予謂今日之文人，皆自命爲天才，目人爲低能。倘以魚龍喻人，人皆魚，自視固神龍也，何龍之多乎？羣龍無首，適爲今日文壇之現象。孰爲龍頭大哥，似猶有待於貨眞價實之天才也。天才天才，予誠寤寐以求之。長夏無事，作文壇龍頭論。</p>
<p>東　未葉，朝廷日亂，綱紀頺弛，李膺獨持風裁，以聲名自高，士有被其容接者，名爲登龍門。唐章懷太子注曰，以魚爲喻也。龍門河水所下之口，在今　州龍門縣。辛氏三秦記曰，河津一名龍門，水險不通，魚　之屬莫能上。江海大魚，薄集龍門下數千不得上，上則爲龍也。登龍一詞，蓋出於此。夫李膺之得爲龍頭，以其憂國忠公，淸心忌恶，危言深論，不隠豪强，挺身而出，被禍不辭，爲天下之楷模，黨人之魁桀也。今日之文壇果有其人乎？其亦有人以此自勉乎？</p>
<p>當八王五胡之亂，安内攘外，胥有未能。文人苦悶，淸談是尙。王衍妙善玄言，傾動當世。朝野翕然，謂之一世龍門。後進之士莫不景慕倣效。可知王衍亦書爲文人中之龍頭也。竊嘗論之。王衍淸談，未爲大惡。不得以放屁放屁，眞正豈有此理　之也。然以雅好玄虚，信仰無治，而又身居重任，尙言不豫世事。是故山　　爲誤盡蒼生，石勒責以破壞天下。今日之文壃果有其人乎。其亦有人可以稍稍相擬乎？</p>
<p>齊梁之際，任　文譽甚隆，好交結奬進，士友得其延譽者，率多升擢，坐上　客，恒有數十，時人慕之，號曰任君，言如　之三君也。後進之士如劉孝绰陸　到旣到洽張率劉顯劉苞殷坛諸人，皆出其門下，時人號爲龍門聚，成號蘭臺聚。所謂聚，猶今言集會，所謂龍門聚蘭臺聚，則爲任　宅第文人集會之名，猶今言文學茶話之類也。至劉孝綽之流，則希冀任眆爲之汲此，假以升官發財者也。任眆旣雅善屬文，尤長載筆，又能憂人之憂，樂人之樂，差能爲一時文壇之龍頭。今日之闊人，未嘗無附庸風雅，覬　文壇者，試問今日之文壇果有任眆其人乎？其亦有人可以稍稍相似乎？</p>
<p>鳴呼！天才不出，如文壇何！莫謂龍頭無人，差喜登龍有術，予亦何幸而爲今之文人耶！</p>
<h3 id="c240">讀「論續作」爲曹聚仁先生進一解 <a href="#c240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— 邱竹師</p>
<p>曹先生在「論續作」裏說出兩點重要的意思：一是，屬於社　的事業，續作不但無妨，而且有時爲必要的，如「史；」一是，文學的創造本爲社　的，故與史篇之有待於續作並無不同，例如水滸。第一點，我極端贊同，第二點去不能無所異議了。</p>
<p>史的任務和性質，與文學不同，它是科學化的東西。只要觀點和方法相同。一部史不要說一二人續作，就是數十，數百，以至數千人續作或合作，都無不可。文學作品怎樣呢？誠如俞平伯先生所說「續書（案：指文學書。）没有好的，不是定說續書的人才情必遠遜於前人，乃因才性不同，正如其面，强其相從，反致兩傷」者也。</p>
<p>文學作品之所以徫大，所以能永久，「一種」正確的觀點是必要的。同樣一個题材，在觀點不同的兩個人寫來，可以有完全異樣的結果。令一個觀點與前作的作者不同的人續作，就算不是「狗尾續貂，」也豈非「牛頭不對馬嘴？」何况續作所取的題材未可盡同於前作耶？則其結果，且將令讀者　亂而莫明其妙。</p>
<p>其次，文學作品之所以偉大，所以能永久，「一種」獨創的　格，「一種」特異的筆調也是重要的。姑假定續作者和前作者的觀點完全相同，而風格和筆調不能一致，續作還是徒勞無功的。紅樓夢的續作（如　紅樓夢）的失敗坐此，水浒的續作（如蕩寇志）的失敗也還坐此。</p>
<p>再次，曹先生說，「自古歌謡的吟，故事的傳述，人人都參加創作的工作，幾乎無從知其孰爲創作，孰爲續作。水漩一書只能說是南宋以來千百年間千萬人的共同創作，直到今天，東方書塲的說話人，還在那裏做續作的工作。」這裏是有語病的。歌謡歷代的傳唱，是增修而非續作，故事的傳述，也是增修而非續作，到最後才經寫定而成今狀，如孔雀東南飛，木蘭辭，以及各種「變文」，徐文長故事等是。水滸又和這些不同。水滸旣不續作，又不是增修，乃是創作。（曹先生未嘗不認識這一點，故說「水滸一書只能說是南宋以來千百年間千萬人的共同創作」，但他忽然又掉過筆頭說，「直到今，東方書場的　　　　　　　　作的工作」，這就出了毛病。）水滸雖也如故事的傳述一樣，經過許多年，許多人的增修，但增修的只是一堆材料，這些材料要通過者的心，眼，加以抉擇和鍜鍊，根據作者的觀點，重新用作者自己的筆表之，才成水滸，正如文學家從現實社會取得材料寫成文學作品一樣，故曰創作，惟其如此，所以作者的技巧對於作品的好壞關係很大，試拿三國演義和水滸比較，雖同是依據傳述的材料，而各自的文學價値大相差異，便可知道了。西廂記雖有趙德粼的商記雖有，滿村傳唱蔡中郎」（註的盲翁的唱詞做）</p>
<p>材料，畢竟不是續作啊。荷馬的史詩，據有一派的說法，「荷馬」的意義是「散片的集合者」，則更可以從西洋的事實來證明歌謡故事是可以增修，寫定，或創作的，而否决曹先生所謂的續作。</p>
<p>本來是曹先生「抛磗引玉，請豈凡先生再談一談，」現在却弄成我這瓦片來獻醜了。</p>
<p>註：原文是「滿村聽唱蔡中郎。」</p>

<p>㈠閒人閒事</p>
<p>名「下帷短牒」云：</p>
<p>王粲好馿，家畜數頭，其價有至百金者。其一曰：「落釵，」其二曰：「遠遊，」其三曰：「　鳥，」其四曰：：「白鳳，」其五曰：「臨江，」其六　　　　　　　　　七日：「奔　，」其八曰：「飛星。」</p>
<p>根據這，王粲是至少畜過八頭馿，而這些馿還有非常動聽的命名，有的香艶，有的優美，有的雄壯，有的飄逸。就因着王粲的馿，我想到吾家少帥所最歡喜的哥爾夫球。都會人生活的緊張忙碌，大概呼吸着都會的空氣的都能知道，但是，當你偶而得着一個機會，跑進哥爾夫球塲時，就會使你感到，在都會裏，也有那麽多的古之閒人，把球向遠遠的洞裏撥，一直要撥十八個小球塲十八個洞。一次撥進一個洞去的因然有，經過六十幾次，而撥不進一個洞的，據說也很普通。一個圈子　過來，一二小時，或者一夜晚，就會給你消磨了。這樣的生活，眞不愧爲有閑階级的有閑生活，比王粲是更高雅。當一個朋友領我去看時，他告訴我，這玩意兒，在美國巳經不新鮮了。不新鮮的理由他没有說，我想這是可以推想得出的，第一，是玩意兒應該常常翻新才有趣，第二，就是十八個洞，或許還不夠消磨。閒着没事想消費的玩意兒，前途總會是廣大的，那麽加上一倍變成三十六個洞的高爾夫球塲，在最近的將來總會實現罷？然而，我從這裏，是看到没落階級無可奈何的生活的糜爛了。（未完）</p>

<p>（秋天，彷彿春天的秋天。）</p>
<p>某醫院裏三樓甬道上，一個頭戴白帽身穿白色長袍的年輕看護婦，手托小小白磁盆子，忽忽忙忙從東邊迦廊走向西去。到樓梯邊時，一個招呼聲止信了她的脚步。從二樓上來了一個女人，在寛闊之字形樓梯上盤旋，身穿绿色長袍，手中拿着一個最時新的朱紅皮夾，使人一看有「　肥紅瘦」感覺。這女人有一雙長長的腿子，上樓時便　得十分輕盈。年紀大約有了二十七八，由於裝飾合法，又彷彿可以把他歲數减輕一些。但醫　之間，時間對於這個人所作的記號，却不能倚賴人爲的方法加以遮飾。就是那寫在口角眉目間的微笑，風度中也巳經帶有一種佳人遲　的調子。</p>
<p>她不能說是十分美麗，但眉眼却秀氣不俗，氣派又大方又尊貴。身體長得修短合度，所穿的衣服又非常稱身，且正因爲那點「绿肥紅瘦」的暮春風度，故使人在第一面後，就留下一個不易忘掉的良好印象。</p>
<p>這個月以來她因爲每按時來院中看一病人，同那看護巳十分熟習，如今在樓梯邊見到了看護，故招呼著，隨卽快步跑上樓了。</p>
<p>她向那看護又親切又温柔的說：</p>
<p>「夏小姐，好呀！」</p>
<p>那看護含笑望望喊她的人手中朱紅皮夾。</p>
<p>「如　小姐，您好！」</p>
<p>「夏小姐，醫生說病人什麽時候出院？」</p>
<p>「曾先生說過一禮拜好些，可是梅先生自己，上半天却說今想走。」</p>
<p>「今天就走嗎？」</p>
<p>「他那麽說的。」</p>
<p>穿绿衣的不作聲，把皮夾從右手遞過左手。</p>
<p>穿白衣的看護彷彿明白那是什麽意思，但接著說：</p>
<p>「曾先生說「不行。」他不簽字，梅先生就不能出院。」</p>
<p>甬道上西端某處病房裏門開了，一個穿白衣剃光頭的男子，露出半個身子，向甬首中的看護喊</p>
<p>「密司夏，快來一點」！</p>
<p>那看護輕輕的說：「我偏不快來」！用眉目作了一個不高興的表示，就怱怱的走去了。　　如　小姐站在樓梯邊一陣子，　不卽走，看到一個年靑圓臉女孩，手中執了一把淺藍色的大花，　扶了一個靑年優美的男子，慢慢的走下樓去。男子顯得久病新　的樣子，臉色蒼白，面作笑容，女孩則臉上光輝紅潤，極其榆快。</p>
<p>一雙美麗　活的眼睛，　著那兩個下樓人在之字形寛闊的樓梯上轉著，到後那　影不見了，爲樓口屏風掩着消滅了。這美麗的眼睛便停頓在樓梯邊棕上草　上，那是一朶細小的藍花。</p>

<h3 id="c264">「馬馬虎虎」 <a href="#c264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— 文炳</p>
<p>「馬馬虎虎」，大言之，是說明着民族性的墜落的全部；小言之，是說明着個人的不長進的生活熊度。</p>
<p>這不是不願幹或簡下袖手而不幹，因爲這是處斷某一事件的「殺腰」的一句話，顯然是曾經幹到了相當的一個階段。所以不能說他没有上進的初心，只能說敷衍從事，没有澈底的勇氣，以至中途敗傷，而以「馬馬虎虎」不了了之。</p>
<p>考馬馬虎虎的來頭，不外是困難與畏怯。</p>
<p>某一事，從始至終，從嘗試以至成功，必然的，其中過程是隠伏着不少的困難，衝得破這困難關頭，便可底於終，底於成功，否則就中止在關頭的前梢，必然會　额而嘆曰：「馬馬虎虎算了吧。」</p>
<p>所以「困難」是馬馬虎虎的第一個勁敵。</p>
<p>然而困難原也不過一種困難，畢竟是能征服得了的，所謂「天下無難事，只怕有心人」，「困難是成功的燈塔」，巳簡切的說明着「事在人爲」，不過這事在人爲，究竟需要一種再接再厲，百折不撓的勇氣，那才衝得破難關。若是畏怯不前，結果亦終不免於「馬馬虎虎」。</p>
<p>所以「畏怯」是馬馬虎虎的第二個勁敵。</p>
<p>淸季伊犂條約失敗於俄，繼由紀澤氏折衝樽俎以規復这。獨佔外交史上的光榮。乃父文正公以練團練而能收復被太平天國奪佔的半壁河山，都是勇敢戰勝困難，不曾「馬馬虎虎」之所致。（曾氏爲滿族所奴役，而無民族思想之差誤，是係另一回事。）</p>
<p>時至今日，事之困難者固多，而勇敢之人實少，上至要人，下逮草野，無不蜷伏於「馬馬虎虎」的烟幕彈下，不能自拔。</p>
<p>就單别的某個人說，問他所做的事怎樣，答話十九是一句「馬馬虎虎」。事</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>實上果然大有人在，難事不願下手，願下手的事，若遇困難，也就轉　換向，掉頭不顧了。</p>
<p>另一面，馬馬虎虎更是附强制弱葬送公理的罪行。無論何事，儘可不問雙方的理直與理屈，第一聲得搬出「馬馬虎虎」來，你一句，我一句，才能把事情弄得轉圓。結果是强者佔上峯，弱者是揑住鼻子不能出氣，公理也就鳴呼尙　了。</p>
<p>就是衖堂裏的白相朋友樂的快活，踢翻小販一担蔬菜，也總是由第三者凑上幾聲「馬馬虎虎」以就了事了的。</p>
<p>「馬馬虎虎」便是這樣：牠是成功事業與伸張公理之大敵，說得澈底一些因爲「馬馬虎虎」，所做的事就等於不做，調處别人的事，便是爲强者而帮閒。</p>
<h3 id="c265">婦女獨身之三大原因 <a href="#c265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— 史斌</p>
<p>婦女也是民衆之一，她地位的重要，已毋庸我最來　述了！自民國肇興以來，受着歐風美雨的感化，和國内先知者的啓導，在婦女本身上，巳覺悟到過去數千年以來，人權的喪失，亟宜謀策恢復，於是乎男妇平等的一切口號與標語，頓時風行全國，以致一般智識淺薄，只知平等名詞，而不明平等實際的婦女，誤入歧路的，實在不少；徒然使一個虚弱的國家，平空的增加着無數的波折吧了！而結果呢？她們的行動和意志，便引起了社會人士的評議和注意，以爲現在的女子太解放而太放浪不　了！那裏知道同時有一部你們所不注意至，而很値得注意的女子，她們正隠在社會的一　呢？這便是本文所要說的「獨身婦女。」現在憑着我們切實的探察，和多方面的調查，知道她們决不是爲了失戀或者是舊制婚姻而不結婚，她們有一種特殊的心理和感覺；經過了我多時愼密的考慮！多方始决定她們獨身的原因，茲特分端記述于下：</p>
<p>（一）恐懼　現在婦女們的要求解放提高，有一般男子們，他們就很熱心地來帮她們的忙（？）唯一的帮忙方法，便是講戀愛；而他們的心理呢？不是朝秦暮楚，便是始亂終棄；還有一般所謂仁人君子們，他們另外載上了一副面具，便會幹出了一娶再娶三娶┆的把戲來，甚至子女已成羣了，也要離婚；這種事情，在當事者，或許算不得什麽一會事，但是被一般富有仁慈性的理智性的女子們看起來，以爲這是喪心埋理的舉動；大有「天下事無以過之」的感慨！於是乎她們看透了男子們以爲皆是如此，根本上便起了懷疑，再從懷疑而發生了「恐懼，」這種恐懼的觀念，在她們的腦海中，越印越深刻，越深而越堅固了！　　（二）旁觀從前的女子僅僅墊居家庭，見聞不廣；現在則不然，他們和男子一樣的厮混在社會的一起，她們可以直接和間接，或看到和聽到，一切爲了婚姻而發生了不幸的事件，最後件件終歸是女子的吃虧；並且她環看着朋友們結婚以後，十九都不能滿意，有的爲了家庭的麻煩而生怨恨之心，有的爲了丈夫不合作而悲憤；她們「旁觀」着别人的痛苦，一面她固欣然慶幸自己還未捲入旋渦，一面便竭力的設法避免一切結婚的引線。</p>
<p>（三）後盾以前的中國，好像是没有女子的份兒似的，一切都是由男子獨權覇佔；旣不許她們去求學，更不允她出外做事；她們無論什麽事情，除掉了仰仗男子以外，一些也没有旁的法子可想；所以她們命運的優劣，是跟着男子們而轉移的。便是受到了種種壓迫與寃屈，也只有俯首忍受。而今的環境，却大大的不同了！什麽事都有了女子的份兒，她們一旦從狹窄的家庭裏，跑到廣泛的社會上來，好比放出了一羣籠中之鳥，還我自由；在她們新覺得的感情上，便引起了心坎中無限的興趣，並且有穏固的職業，做着「後盾」，在物質上旣樂存　用，在精神　　　自由；安適而又自然，那般自命看透了世故人情的女子，她們看着結婚。好似要她們進　　似的，堅實地不願意了！</p>
<p>以上的三個原因，都有互相的關係而發生，唯後者最佔重要，這種富有傳染性的不結婚主義，到現在已大有一唱百和之槪；她們深信着羡慕着，一般抱獨身主義的先進者的生活之舒適，與深　着家庭生少的麻煩束約，所以傾向於這種主義的女子，日見增加，却不見减少了：</p>
<p>末了！在下還得說一句：獨身的女子，大多皆學識宏博者，她們辦事幹練，富有思想，倘使運用于家庭，那末家庭組織，子女敎育，定多貢獻；可惜她們不顧大局，眞是影響社會不淺啊：可嘆！二二，八，六，草於孟樓</p>

<p>編者先生；</p>
<p>我是小烟纸雜貨店裏的學徒；店裏每天要銷售金鼠牌美麗牌等各種國貨紙烟，爲數很是可觀。這許多國貨香烟，每小包内，例脸小　片一張；刷精，背有廣告。但是我看大一半買烟的人，總是把這小　片抛棄於地，很少加以注意的。因想這筆巨額的印刷費，豈不完全是拿錢抛於水中嗎？爲何不將此錢省下，向美國購二架戰鬭機，平時在這飛機上，一樣可以寫些廣告；牠的力量，也許會比目下的小畫片大得多呢！我想設法使國貨烟公司採納這個建議。</p>
<p>先生，你能贊成這個辦法嗎？你能夠帮帮我的忙，把這封信，在貴報本埠附刋店員通訊欄登出嗎？余知靑謹啓</p>
<p>編者　　余君這個建義，的確是一個切實可行的辦法。我們知道，每一個些稍有點地位的國貨烟公司，像南洋華成等幾家，每年所耗於這小畫片上的金錢，至少要有四五萬；把牠集中起來，其數實屬可觀。這小畫片的効力，因爲什九是被棄的緣故，無疑地很是微弱。各公司要是一律把牠省了，决不會對於營業上發生影響。前年紅錫包（非國貨）不是曾經因爲烟價飛漲而實行過嗎？結果，牠的銷路，仍舊有增無减。何况將這筆欵子，移充救國之用呢？我想吸烟的人，决不會有異議的。國貨烟公司的當局呀！你們倒考慮考慮看呢？</p>

<h3 id="c269">美國電影界的窮迫 <a href="#c269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— 侯楓</p>
<p>我們在美國的電影藝術史裏，是找不到像德國一樣的藝術思潮的變化的。表現派的電影和Ｒｏｍａｎｕｃ的電影，是德國特有的東西。美國的電影可以說是完全没有内容的。藝術有了進展和變遷，我們纔可以檢討牠的内容；但没有内容的美國電影，這種檢討是非常困難的　　從無聲電影的黃金時代，到現在的有聲電影的勃興期，其進化的程度到底是怎樣？</p>
<p>美國的電影界，在現在可以說是窮迫疲弊已至極點的時期了。經濟界破天荒所未有的不景氣直接影響到電影的觀衆，各家電影院的觀客比着從前，是要少得多了！</p>
<p>當然，所謂藝術的黃金時代，便是衣食住滿足的時代。如果衣食住不能滿足，那裏有需　藝術的工夫？然而經濟充裕的人，他們對於藝術反覺得格格不入了；他們所需要的反是女人的曲線美，所以Ｒｅｖｕｅ歌舞的電影之所以盛行，便在這一點。</p>
<p>藝術本來常常是在藝術家的窮迫的時候産生出來的。然而這是個人的窮迫，並不時代的窮迫。時代窮迫的時候，是絶對没有産生好的作品的。况且電影並非個人的藝術。在這暴風雨一樣的世界恐慌中，要希望着有好的藝術電影作品出現，那只是一個幻夢罷了。</p>
<p>像派拉蒙，華纳兄弟，米曲羅，福斯等大公司，無不被捲入經濟恐慌的旋渦中，使他們有的把幹部縮小，有的把經費節省，都是專心一意地去實行整理。同時，要打開此不况，不是用好的藝術作品而是用娯樂的和有趣味的作品，來把握着社會的傾向，這是最近美國電影界的情勢。戰爭和經濟恐慌的時代，是没有産生出眞正的藝術之可能性。電影是美國五大産業之一，在此經濟恐慌尖銳化的時期，也决不能逃脫此恐慌的範圍以外。</p>
<p>缺乏正鵠的感情的電影製作者，不論他們怎樣去努力創造藝術，到底是不可能。他們的良心已經是喪失的了。他們只有將一些没有藝術的價値平凡無味的電影，來奉獻給忘却了批評的美國的觀客之前。</p>
<p>美國的電影製作者們，對於趣味平凡的電影和猛　電影等，像洪水一般的濫發，是一九三三年的一個無情的樣相，是電影藝術史上的污點。Ｒｅｖｕｅ電影本來是一時消聲滅跡了，我們以爲這是有聲電影初期變態的畸形兒。然而近來美國的電影界，對於Ｒｅｖｕｅ電影的讚美之聲，可以說是高達雲霄了，「24ＮＤ　Ｓｕｅｔ」便是他們如　似狂的讚美着的出品。</p>
<p>我們將美國和德意忐來比較吧！在世界大戰的苦惱中的德國，却産生出表現主義的電影，和其反動的史劇電影，而在此經濟恐的困境中的美國，祇有Ｒｅｖｕｅ電影，獵艶的和趣味的電影之出現。</p>
<p>總之，美國的電影界，是恐怕已没有産出眞正的藝術之可能了！</p>

<h3 id="c270">評「動物院慘案」Ｍｕｒｄｅｒｓ　ｉｎ　ｔｈｅ　ｚｏｏ <a href="#c270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— 白亮</p>
<p>丨大光明映丨</p>
<p>看過了「動物院慘案」這片以後，我就可以毫不躊躇的告訴一般後去的觀衆們：</p>
<p>㈠若是你對這片懷着極大的希望丨希望它對社會有什麽新貢獻的話，那末，一定會使你失望，而且會萬分的懊喪</p>
<p>㈡若是你想從這個片中，去認識社會的實際生活的，那末，倒還可以，因爲它正可以使你看到這現社會的一層的情形。而且，這一層。還是最美麗的一層。</p>
<p>㈢如果你原來是對於看任何的影片是當做茶餘飯後的消遣的：那末，我不是說句過分的話，我可以負責的告訴你，你很可以得。因爲這故事正似它的標題那樣動人，那樣的眞切；它裏面有人和人的肉搏，畜和畜的角鬭，有人的悲嚎，有畜的狂嘯。當你講這故事給别人聽的時候，一定可以眞切的感動許多聽衆的，你可以嚇得你的孩子逃跑，你更可以嚇得你的愛人，躲進你的懷裏來。</p>
<p>講到這故事的題材呢，那末，無疑義的，它是在暴露現社會底最美麗一層中的罪惡，醜態。自然，某一部份的人，是决不會相信，所謂罪惡醜態的這種事情，是會發生在現社會的最美麗的一層中，尤其是所謂上層階級中：可是，事實是事實，不要說在外國，就是在咱們這老大的中國裏面吧，現制度下面的買辦地主豪紳官吏等階級中的人物，爲達到他們底某一種的卑鄙的慾望，有不少是整天的在努力創造着各式各樣的罪惡呵？這是誰也瞞不了誰的事情。我們的「動物院慘案」的編劇者，他就是緊緊的抓住了這一點。他很有力的描寫出一個社會中占有很高地位的動物學者，他爲了獨占他對他妻的愛情，他不惜用了很精細的科學方法，去殺死他凡是和他的妻親近的情敵。結果，雖是因此而被殺，但是，的編劇者的主旨，是無論如何也掩飾不了的。</p>
<p>至於導演，收音，配光等都可以說很不差。演員方面，Ｌｌｏｎｅｌ　ａｌｗｉｌｌ扮演動物學者的那種陰險沉毅的態度，和他的妻丨Ｋａｌｈｌｅｅｎ　Ｂｕｒｋｅ　扮演丨底活潑眞切的表情，相當的都可說是成功的。　　綜觀全劇，在美國過去運來中國的同一類的片中，不能不算是一部富有鑒賞價値的片子。不過，話又得說回來，如果，我們希望電影能負起文化使命來的話，那末，這片子總好像還不是大衆所需要的吧。</p>
<h3 id="c271">評「海賊」 <a href="#c271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— 摩爾</p>
<p>從「海賊」的大體上說來，還是男女糾紛的影片，并且最後也拿結婚的大團圓終結。但是「海賊」，到底和美國式的愛情影片不同。它的故事，是一段非常帶有懚感的悲劇。史訶夫旣然私愛瑪麗凱瓏玲，而又和印度少女迪娜，堕入情網。但因麥的愛人馬考夫的友谊關係，浪跡天涯，流爲海盜。這種少年維特的精神雖則愚蠢，然而的確極動人的。後來即和瑪麗結合，也只是瑪麗的一往情深，說是變愛，還不如說是感激好些。這種故事，美國片中是不多見的。</p>
<p>同時「海賊」還有他的重要地方，就是他對於宗敎的解釋。他對於「神」是懷疑的，但是它以爲「信仰」是應該有的。這種不徹底的「宗敎」見解，是可以代表歐州一部份人物的。自然，在耶穌敎傳統的包圍之下，它還只能對旁的「神敎」（印度的）攻擊，假使觀衆以爲他攻擊「印度的神敎」，就以爲是對於「耶敎」的保護，是不對的。字幕「如果你有靈，我準到敎堂去向你祈禱」，「如果你有靈」一句，我覺得應該重視的。</p>
<p>技術方面，導演者似乎没有駡御這一個故事的力量「特别是感情方面。我覺得富有感情的戲，而導演者不能十分的抓緊感情寫，是極大的失敗。并且史訶夫流爲海盜以後，導演者以「性忽粗暴」，來表現它的靈魂的創傷是非常好。不過在無人之處，應該來幾個落寞傷神的塲面和表情，因爲只寫「粗暴」，是不夠的。還有史訶夫在「友誼」和「變愛」衝突的時候，導演者應該用盡一切的方法來表現他的痛苦。說極端一點「海賊」中最可以做戲的就在這地方，而海賊的導演忽略了。</p>
<p>演員方面，男主角是會做戲的，不過導演者不能使他盡其所長女主角做戲的機會少得多，没有十分好的表演，是當然的了。他如镜頭分幕，都有可觀。　　總之「海賊」，是并不十分出色的片子。但和美國片比，無論故事和技術方面，都還過得去</p>

<p>— 沈西苓</p>
<p>有幾個電影製作方面的朋友說：現在的電影批評者只顧到自己的說話，　格的要求，從不注意到製作上的難處，要他自己來製作一張片子的時候，我相信一定是不成一個東西。同時有幾個電影批評方面的朋友說：「現在中國的電影，不論在那一方面，總是粗劣，幼穉┆┆」</p>
<p>他們都有相當的理由，便他們都没有十二分地了解或許是忽略了兩者間的分劃和聯關。　　實際，批評者確是忽略了製作上的客觀條件。但製作者却也不必强要批評者來製作一張片子的必要。製作者的任務是在開拓他的創造，是在他的偉大的創造。批評者的任務重要的，是在　明某一作品的内在意味，和它的存在的價値。爲了這樣，他必然地得知道製作上的一切客觀條件和社會科學的知識。</p>
<p>製作者爲了要探求他創造的源泉；這裡，至少批評者可以貢獻他一些線索，同時至少可以給他一些方向上的啟示。丨當然他也須運用他的明確頭腦，來檢别五花八門中的批評的準確路線。批評者與製作者多有各自修養的軌道。同時中國電影的前進，不是在兩者間的相互譏笑，而在兩者相互的鼓勵下。</p>

<p>丨東和館的沿革和内容丨</p>
<p>在這中日間關係非常「密切」的當兒，似乎日本的電影事業也爲吾人所需要注意的吧。我現在姑且一述上海的日本寫眞館（電影院）的情况罷。按上海四五年前，有一　日本影院（院名忘）設在北四川路上海大戲院附近，因爲規模較小，又不善選片，不久關門大吉；可是具有數十年歷史的「東和館」却依然存在。也可以說，它是成了今日上海唯一的日本電影院了。五年前它是設在虹口武昌路的，現在巳搬到了乍浦路海寗路中。門口式樣，並不偉大，裏邊却純粹「和化」極盡精緻布置之能事。樓上樓下可容二三千觀衆；不過樓上是女賓席，没有座位一個厚厚的墊子，攤在地上，前低後高，總分三級；每級前圍有銅欄使她們可以席地倚欄而觀。樓下呢，女子也有。禁價分樓下六角樓上一元兩種。白天停映，祇映夜間一塲，星期日呢例外。看客很多，不過逢軍人和學生，則减收半價座費。他們所映的片子，可分「新」「舊」兩種。「新」係指時代作，「舊」乃純是古裝的歷史影片，都有深刻底意識，技巧上也絶對不是粗製濫造。字幕是唯美派，十分考究，今日也多映有聲片，好的默片，當然也不因此放棄，間或開映。映片時候，有男的女的，在台旁依照着片中的情景，作各個淺顯的對白，務使一般觀衆完全了解，這是爲各國所没有的創舉。戲院原是商辦的，所以也没有禁止地說「祇限本國人入内」，然而事實上，外國人進日本電影院的很少很少。</p>

<p>Negotiations Temporarily Stalled</p>
<p>(Beiping) The issues of receiving Doushan and various passes of the Great Wall, as well as the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Dongshixia, have been temporarily stalled due to the change of personnel in the Japanese Kwantung Army. The new Commander of the Kwantung Army, Hishikari, has arrived in Changchun to take office and is expected to receive a reply from the Japanese side within days to continue negotiations. Liu Shisun, the commissioner responsible for negotiations on our side, is now going to Tianjin to await the Japanese reply. Regarding the war zone, there are a total of more than seventy large and small passes of the Great Wall. Except for five passes including Jieling, Lengkou, Xifeng, Dongjia, and Gubei, which are guarded by Japanese soldiers, the remaining sixty or so minor passes such as Malanyu are either scattered with Japanese troops, but in very small numbers. Our side intends to negotiate with the Japanese immediately to have the secondary passes taken over by war zone police first. The other five major passes must wait until the Japanese troops withdraw before our side can begin taking over. As for the Japanese troops stationed in Luanzhou, Qian'an, and Shixia, they are still using the excuse that after the Sino-Japanese ceasefire, Bangyi has not yet restored its original peaceful state, hence the delayed withdrawal, intending to monitor us. However, they do not interfere with our administrative power. The Japanese army uses the Luan River to transport military supplies to Rehe, and it is expected to be completed before the river freezes. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Jiang Bocheng, Xiao Zhenying, and senior staff officer Hou Ying, etc., are going to Zhangjiakou today. Jiang said that he was invited by Song's telegram to go and discuss all matters. Except for the two Jilin army units, all other miscellaneous armies in Chahar Province have sent representatives to Zhang, and thorough consultations have been held. Regarding the two Jilin army units, the central government has decided on measures to deal with them. As soon as he arrives in Zhang, he will telegraph to invite representatives of the two to discuss everything in person. As for which units of each army should be incorporated and which should be disbanded, it has now been determined and will be in accordance with the central government's intentions and the principles set by the Beiping Military Branch. Apart from the 100,000 yuan that Song brought with him, the remaining 50,000 yuan for Chahar's military expenses has been gradually sent by the Military Branch. The August salary has been telegraphed to the central government to be issued as soon as possible, but no reply has been received yet. He will return to Beiping in three or four days, and Xiong Bin will return to Beiping first the day after tomorrow. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xiao Zhenying said that he went to Zhang this time with Jiang Bocheng to assist Song Zheyuan in handling affairs in Chahar. Three measures have now been decided for the two Jilin army units: 1) Telegraph to Jilin first, asking them to send representatives to Zhangjiakou to discuss everything openly and honestly; 2) If the two parties are unwilling to send representatives, representatives will be sent by Jiang, Xiong, Song, and others to the defense areas of Jilin to facilitate contact; 3) If it still cannot be resolved, Jiang, Xiong, Hou, and others will consult with Song and handle it with full authority, without the need to ask for instructions. Now that the weather is cool, the two Jilin army units are short of food and clothing, and the morale of the army is disintegrating. With careful methods to deal with them, they can definitely be subdued. As for the list of Chahar committee members, it has been submitted to the central government for review and will be announced soon. Zhang Jiyong said that after they sent Feng first to Mount Tai, Feng felt that since he had entered the mountains, he was afraid he was not deep enough and would rest in Mount Tai for the time being. The central government has telegraphed to urge Feng to enter the capital, but Feng said that he plans to go south after the autumn cools. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>

After he arrives in Zhang, he will ask Fang and Ji to send representatives to Zhang to discuss the reorganization. (24th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>The People's Dikes in the Middle Reaches Are Weak and Mostly Flooded</p>
<p>Sun Tonggang's Plane Encountered Wind and Rain and Returned to Dong'e</p>
<p>(Jinan) Today, the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River are still rising. In the middle reaches, Luokou rose by seven centimeters, with a water level of 31.012 meters. In the lower reaches, Dama Village, Zhang Sang, rose by three centimeters, with a water level of 15.036 meters. Both are new records in the past three years. Fortunately, Dongzhuang in the upper reaches has fallen by seven centimeters since the 22nd. If the upper reaches do not rise again, the water level in the middle and lower reaches can fall tomorrow. However, the people's dikes in the middle reaches are weak and mostly flooded. 1. The Maowang Village in Dong'e was flooded, affecting the Dongping 97 districts, which have become a swamp. 2. The people's dike in Sunwo Village in Feicheng overflowed. From that village to the Xiaba Village under the Changqing Dike, about thirty miles to the north, has become a swamp, with a water depth of over ten feet. 3. The people's dike in the Dongqiao area of Changqing overflowed by seven or eight feet, and the water along the river mostly flowed out over the dike. Villages in the Huanghuayuan Xiadian Village area are all seven or eight feet deep in water. Pan Yifen, the section chief of the River Bureau, is now supervising the emergency rescue in Changqing. However, the above are all people's dikes, and the large dikes defended by the River Bureau are not in danger. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) At 2:00 PM, Sun Tonggang and He Siyuan flew to Caozhou again to inspect. On the way to Dong'e, they encountered strong winds and rain and immediately turned back from the north bank of the Yellow River, arriving in Jinan at 5:00 PM. According to reports, dozens of villages where the people's dikes in Changqing overflowed were flooded. The dikes were crowded with people, all of whom were evacuating from the water. In villages between the large dikes and people's dikes more than ten miles west of Luokou, villagers could see the water. Villagers, both men and women, young and old, were all blocking the water together, and the situation was tense. Sandbags have been used to block the water. The opposite bank, North Luokou, is close to the water. Li Shuchun, the director of the Civil Affairs Department, will go to Luokou again tonight to inspect and supervise the work.

<p>(Xuzhou) Li Mingyang, accompanied by She Nian, inspected the Xubu Ring City Dike on the 24th, believing that it was necessary to thoroughly rectify it, and inspected the anti-flooding dikes in the north of the city and the Tongwei River channel. In the evening, various groups hosted a banquet for Li, requesting the province to subsidize the repair of the dike to permanently prevent flooding. Li agreed to telegraph the province to allocate funds so that the Xubu dike can be restored to its original state. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) The Provincial Government received a telegram from the Transportation and Construction Bureau, sending Ding Qiqian to Hanzhuang to inspect the water situation of Weishan Lake. Ding Qiqian telegraphed that the Yellow River had breached its banks, and the situation in western Shandong was critical. Fengdang had water, Tongpei was not in danger, and Weishan Lake had not risen. The water level of the Zhishi shed at the lake entrance was 1.96 meters. After checking that the zero point of the Zhishi shed at the lake entrance of Hanzhuang was 29.161 meters above sea level, it was estimated that the water level of the lake was 31.121 meters above sea level. The First Route Army has ordered the troops stationed along the canal to assist in the emergency rescue and has also built a Yu Huang Dam on the Shunqing River to prevent the Yellow River water from invading. On the 24th, the water levels along the canal all fell. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Report on the Progress of Negotiations on Yellow River Management</p>
<p>(Jinan) Wang Yingyu and Zhang Hanying returned to the capital today to report on the progress of negotiations with Han and Liu Zhi on Yellow River management. Wang said that the Yellow River management plan has not yet received a reply from Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei, but the 500,000 yuan that Wang has ordered him to freely dispose of is not a problem. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed to Wang Jingwei, Huang Shaoxiong, Zou Lin, Xu Shiying, Wang Yingyu, etc., stating that according to Gu Zhutong's telegram on the 17th, which was forwarded based on reports from various counties under Xuzhou, the Yellow River water had reached Gaozhai in Dangshan, with a width of one mile at the head of the water and a height of five feet, and a width of five miles at the rear and a height of over ten feet, with a speed of more than ten miles per hour, with a tendency to enter Zhaoyang Lake. After checking that the Yellow River water is bound to enter the canal through the Huai River, the counties of Pipi, Suisui, Siliang, and Huai in northern Jiangsu will all be flooded. The matter is serious. Please quickly find ways to detain and rescue them. In addition to telegraphing a reply, please immediately order the relevant provinces to quickly send personnel to jointly prevent and block the water, and convene a meeting within a specified period to earnestly plan to save the situation. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Zhi telegraphed Xu Xinwu, stating that the two telegrams received on that day were all read carefully. Rectifying the river mouth by organizing the eastern waters of Changti is too slow to solve the urgent need, and it cannot be achieved with 300,000 yuan. In an emergency, we must treat the symptoms, so we have to repair the ruins and fill the gaps, starting with the disaster area first. It is hoped that you will consult with Chairman Li and start construction as soon as possible. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Li Yizhi's Talk After Arriving in the Capital</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Li Yizhi, Chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, arrived in the capital on the morning of the 24th. According to him, this Yellow River flood is unprecedented in nearly ninety years. It is not certain whether the disaster situation will expand in the future. Currently, the committee is handling the following matters: 1) Surveying the actual situation of the disaster areas in Henan, Hebei, Shandong, and Jiangsu, so as to propose a flood control meeting to decide. At the same time, it is cooperating with the Land Survey Bureau of the General Staff Department, and aerial surveying is also in progress. Disaster area maps of 1:100,000 can be drawn in two weeks. 2) Convening a flood control meeting of six provinces, and the meeting yesterday discussed the preparation of relief measures (technical and financial), which will definitely be satisfactorily resolved. 3) The work of repairing the dikes has been requested to be presided over by Commissioner Xu. After the closing of the flood control meeting, he will take the technicians to the disaster area and implement it in sequence according to the predetermined procedures. After this symptom-treating work is completed, the committee will engage in fundamental management for a long period of time. 4) After the flood control meeting of the six provinces, it is proposed not to organize a flood control meeting, but to establish a central flood control office to supervise the river affairs personnel of the provinces to handle the closing of the breach and flood control projects. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Li Yizhi presented to President Wang, stating that according to the telegram from Wang Yingyu, it is better to choose the key points for practical treatment of both symptoms and root causes than to distribute limited resources in a widespread and ineffective manner. After further investigation, the cost of the Changti project at the river mouth is more than 1 million yuan, and the stone dams around Tongwaxiang are about 400,000 yuan. It is proposed to hand over 300,000 yuan to Chairman Han to supervise the completion of the Changti at the river mouth by the military and civilians under his command, and to hand over the remaining 200,000 yuan to Chairman Liu, after deducting more than 20,000 yuan for surveying the key areas of a thousand square miles and for the expenses of the opening of the flood control conference, to request him to work with the authorities in Jiangsu and Anhui to supervise the military and civilians to build the stone dams around Tongwaxiang. While it was being reviewed and handled, Commissioner Xu Xinwu also submitted a signed report, stating that Vice Chairman Wang suddenly advocated building long water-gathering embankments and rectifying the river mouth in his telegram on the 22nd. At present, the most important thing is to close the breach and rescue the disaster. How can we talk about other plans? After checking, the Executive Yuan transferred 50 million yuan from the Jiangfang surplus to the association to prevent and block the breaches along the river to consolidate disaster prevention. The governments and people of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu have repeatedly telegraphed appeals, which are also for this and not for that. Moreover, in this Yellow River flood, there are breaches in the attributes of Hebei and Shandong, not just around Tongwaxiang. The flood prevention project cannot be covered by 50 million yuan. If a large amount of money is transferred to other projects, and only 180,000 yuan is used to build the Tongwaxiang stone dam, it would be to reverse the importance of the matter, and neither treating the root cause nor the symptoms would be of any benefit. If we follow Vice Chairman Wang's proposal, it will inevitably cause disputes, delay disaster relief, and it is not shallow. After checking, this Yellow River flood is unprecedented in decades, and the disasters in Shandong, Hebei, Henan, and Jiangsu are particularly severe. The association is still preparing and has not been able to plan ahead. It has been ordered to convene a flood control conference to discuss and discuss rescue plans with the relevant agencies to jointly plan the implementation. The breaches are not in one place, and the disasters vary in size and affect six provinces, and the severity is different. How to implement the project and how to allocate the funds are all matters that need to be resolved in a concrete manner by the conference to be fair. It is also in line with the three guidelines issued by the Junwen Order, and it can slightly console the request of the disaster-stricken areas. Vice Chairman Wang had the idea of treating the root cause in an urgent manner, so he made a proposal in his telegram. Commissioner Xu was once assigned to preside over the lower reaches of the Yellow River embankment and was afraid that if the funds were not allocated, the provinces might have criticisms, so he also made a statement. Although the tendencies are different, the intentions are the same. The flood control conference is about to be held, and I have been working hard to come to the capital as soon as possible to discuss this issue publicly to comply with the Ming Order. Is it appropriate? Please review and indicate compliance. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>丨The Four Countries of Germany, Italy, Austria, and Hungary Are Brewing an Economic Alliance丨</p>
<p>The result of the meeting between Italian Black Shirt Prime Minister Mussolini and Austrian Prime Minister Dollfuss, although kept secret, is generally speculated by politicians to be based on economics and supplemented by politics. In other words, it is to connect the relationship between Germany, Italy, Austria, and Hungary to confront the "Versailles system" led by France. Why do we say this? Italy has a poor natural endowment. Its iron ore production is only one-tenth of Germany's, and its coal production is also very small. Today, Italy produces virtually no oil, which is indispensable for industry and military preparations. The only industry that can stand on its own in the world is rayon. How can this small country dominate the world and compete for Europe? However, Italy always wants to divide the control of the European continent with France, to monopolize the Mediterranean to subdue North Africa, and to take the Adriatic Sea as its inland sea. But today, it lacks suitable military ports. The 400-mile coastline along the Adriatic Sea is almost entirely sandy beaches, with no place to open up ports. The coast of Dalmatia, belonging to Yugoslavia on the opposite side, is mostly cliffs and precipices, facing the sea and backing mountains, forming a scenic spot that can station warships and stop merchant ships in no less than a dozen places. This is why D'Annunzio used national interests and occupied "Fiume" by force at the Paris Peace Conference. Now that Italy is the vanguard of Fascist countries and one of the European hegemons, it is almost impossible to hide its desire for the ports on the opposite side. That is why there were rumors in Britain that it agreed to Italy's possession of the Dalmatian coast after Mussolini's meeting with MacDonald and before the establishment of the Four-Power Pact.</p>
<p>France, however, has been doing its best to support the Treaty of Versailles, single-mindedly maintaining its hegemony and preserving the current national borders of the small countries in Central Europe. Its intention is to limit Italy's rapid growth and prevent the expansion of German militarism. Germany and Italy see this situation and are increasingly promoting understanding between the two countries. The voices for revising the Treaty of Versailles are high and reach the clouds. The air in Central Europe is becoming increasingly tense, and it seems that it cannot be resolved without war.</p>
<p>As for the relationship between Germany and Austria, since the establishment of the St. Germain Treaty against Austria, Austria's land has been shrinking day by day. It is strangled by "Czechoslovakia" in the north and controlled by "Yugoslavia" in the south. The population is dense. Vienna alone has a population of 2 million, accounting for one-third of the Austrian people. Agriculture is limited to the area and cannot be expanded. Industry suffers from a lack of raw materials. Hungary is in the same situation. Its peace treaty is tantamount to declaring Austria-Hungary's death sentence. At the very least, it can be said to have been shackled, leaving no room for maneuver. Therefore, apart from merging with Germany or being a vassal state, there is no possibility of survival. This is why the talk of Austria-Germany merger arose with the initial promotion of the Austria-Germany customs union two years ago. In this precarious situation, Germany hopes to have the help of neighboring countries. Later, after being hindered by external forces, the merger could not be achieved, but the relationship between the two countries remained close. There is a force that cannot but be mutually combined politically and economically. So why is Austria preventing the activities of the Hitler Party in Austria today and becoming close to Italy? What is the reason?</p>
<p>Since Hitler came to power in Germany, driven by patriotism, he has vigorously squeezed out the Jews and respected only the German nation. Neighboring small countries such as Hungary and Austria cannot but feel apprehensive about this situation. After nationalism is extremely developed, there is only aggression. Germany's performance in the past history has been extremely obvious. As for German-Italian cooperation, it is only a temporary relationship of interests. If France can make concessions to Germany again and revise or abolish the Treaty of Versailles, giving Germany the opportunity to expand its military preparations, the contradictions between Germany and Italy will become apparent. Austria is between the two major powers, assessing the situation and weighing the advantages and disadvantages, believing that Italy's malice is less than Germany's, and that the economic relations between Italy and Austria are easier to cooperate. Therefore, the center of the economic alliance of the four countries of Italy, Germany, Austria, and Hungary will shift from Germany to Italy. From then on, the opposition of the European and European situations will become more acute, which is undoubtedly true.</p>

<p>Tragically Passes Away Upon Achievement</p>
<p>Berlin, National News Agency, 23rd – Li Jige, a 19-year-old girl, set a world record by swimming for 100 hours non-stop. However, tragically, she passed away upon achieving this feat. It is now known that the cause of her death was due to the greed of her manager and her mother. Previously, the young woman had already set a record by swimming for 73 hours non-stop. She wanted to increase her record to 100 hours, so she started swimming in Lake Baldeney near Essen on Sunday. This was an attempt to earn money with her athletic skills. After swimming for 20 hours, the weather suddenly turned cold, and the young woman wanted to stop. When she reached 79 hours, she wanted to get out of the water again, but her manager and her mother prevented her. When she reached 100 hours, she lost all consciousness. People on the shore fired guns, threw bombs, and played music loudly, hoping to wake her up, but all in vain. After administering medicine, a heavy dose of camphor was given, and she woke up for a moment, but soon died of exhaustion. How tragic! When the young woman entered the water, she was covered with thick grease to prevent the cold. When she came out of the water, the grease had all frozen and peeled off in pieces.</p>

<p>Vienna, National News Agency, 23rd – Austria's internal problems are now undergoing a rapid change, but its scope is still unpredictable. It is difficult to expect the current situation, which relies solely on emergency orders to maintain the situation, to last. It is predicted that before winter, Austria must have a new organization to save Austria's internal crisis. In this effort, there are already three distinct trends: The first is the establishment of a "strong government." Those who advocate this theory are Prince Starhemberg and Dr. Fey, and the Heimwehr organization is supporting them. The second faction is the Christian Social Party, centered on the current Prime Minister Dollfuss and Defense Minister Vaugoin. They strongly oppose the involvement of domestic troops in politics and are willing to organize a political committee to replace the old parliament without holding new elections. The third faction is led by the current Deputy Prime Minister Winkler, who is opposed to the first faction and is the mainstay of the pro-German faction. Their claim is that Austria is actually a part of Germany and should cooperate with the motherland.</p>
<p>Paris, National News Agency, 24th – Le Matin published a report from Rome saying that there are rumors in Italian political circles that the foreign ministers of France, England, and Germany will go to Rome in the second half of October to discuss everything with the Italian Prime Minister. However, the Roman French Embassy has not received any news about this matter. Rome, Havas, 23rd – The Times published a news item from Vienna stating that Czech Foreign Minister Benes will come to Rome. The newspaper commented, "No one can deny that the Czech Foreign Minister is good at diplomacy. However, his excessive suspicion of Rome's influence on the new European policy may not be his shortcoming. The reason why the relationship between Italy and Czechoslovakia has not been clarified in a reasonable period within the scope necessary for the interests of the two countries lies with the Moldau River (referring to the Czech capital) rather than with the Tiber River (referring to Rome). But in any case, it is better for the Czech Foreign Minister to come to Italy as soon as possible. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's plans and methods are very clear, and any diplomatic negotiations will be extremely convenient."</p>

<p>Standard Price Depends on the British Market</p>
<p>Advisory Committee Established to Temporarily Supervise Implementation</p>
<p>London, Reuters, 23rd – This afternoon, the International Wheat Conference, attended by representatives from 31 countries, has agreed on the international wheat price. This is a real step towards the international wheat agreement. It is reported that what has been set is the gold price for delivery at the destination dock, excluding tariffs. This price is based on the average market price of imported wheat sold weekly at British ports. The average market price of wheat will be maintained for four months, and then the importing countries can change their tariffs. This price will be discussed in French and American gold coins. The Wheat Advisory Committee currently being organized will be temporary in nature to monitor the implementation of the wheat agreement and to determine the measures contained in the agreement, but it will not monitor wheat production and trade. Major exporting countries and the Soviet Union will each have representatives to join the advisory committee, and the Danube countries will jointly send two representatives to join. The number of representatives sent by importing and exporting countries will be equal on both sides. It is expected that the final agreement can be obtained tomorrow.</p>

<p>Washington, National News Agency, 23rd – The US government has formulated a wheat control plan, mainly to greatly reduce the number of acres planted with wheat. Regarding exports and pricing, etc., will be changed at any time. Agriculture Secretary Wallace had originally planned to publish it tonight, but because he heard of progress at the London Wheat Conference, he temporarily postponed the disclosure. Wallace claimed that the United States is happy to join any suitable movement to raise wheat prices and regulate production.</p>
<p>US Authorities Work Hard to Promote Recovery Industry Regulations</p>
<h3 id="e76">Coal Industry Agreement to Take Time to Establish <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Washington, Reuters, 24th – National Industrial Recovery Act Executive Officer General Johnson warned last night by broadcasting to those who obscured the axis and did not comply with the industrial recovery case, saying that they would find ways to force compliance with industry regulations. He further said that employers in the United States who agreed to increase wages and reduce working hours have accounted for one-third. Although President Roosevelt strongly urged industrial peace, there are still many labor disputes. The authorities implementing the recovery case have decided that although workers are free to choose their own labor unions, in the event of a dispute, an anonymous vote may be held, without adhering to the protests of the labor advisory committee. At present, the coal industry still does not have the prospect of establishing an agreement soon.</p>
<p>Washington, Reuters, 23rd – General Johnson, Executive Officer of the Industrial Recovery Act, discussed commercial lending with the Federal Reserve and the Financial Rehabilitation Corporation today to address the financial issues required by commerce in promoting the national prosperity plan. The methods to be adopted have not yet been agreed, but some progress has been made. General Johnson is still fully handling the coal industry issue. President Roosevelt has paid close attention to the complexity of this matter. The deadline for submitting the coal industry regulations will expire tonight, but the drafting of the coal industry and automobile industry regulations is proceeding very smoothly. The discussions on the retail industry have revealed a serious situation, because there are a large number of retailers in the country. If retailers are not subject to the provisions of the recovery regulations, it is feared that it will harm the business of large merchants.</p>
<p>Washington, Reuters, 23rd – General Johnson explained the collective bargaining clause in the Recovery Act, saying that the words "open shops or closed shops" cannot be included in current laws. Johnson's claim is to allow employees to work under the industry regulations organized in the public union or the labor union, but employers are not allowed to force employees to join the company's union.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Gandhi Wasting Away <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Bombay, Havas, 23rd – Gandhi is getting thinner day by day, has lost two pounds, and is vomiting constantly. Meetings are being held all over the country demanding the release of Gandhi. The Bombay government is quite concerned because if Gandhi dies in prison, there will be serious consequences. However, the central government in Shimla considers this matter to be ridiculous. The parliament opposed the government sending representatives for Gandhi's affair and filed an impeachment against the government. As a result of the vote, the government finally won because government-appointed personnel participated in the vote.</p>
<p>Bombay, Havas, 23rd – This afternoon, when Gandhi was about to lose consciousness, the government immediately decided to release him. When Gandhi was sent to Mrs. Linkeshe's villa, several private doctors were urgently summoned to treat him.</p>
<p>Poona, Reuters, 23rd – When the news of Gandhi's unconditional release reached the hospital, Gandhi's close friend, the old pastor Andrew, happened to be by his side. Gandhi looked very conscious and only asked Andrew to recite a prayer. Gandhi responded in a low voice. After the prayer, he drank a little orange juice, and then was transported to Mrs. Linkeshe's Marble Palace in a sick car and recuperated in the corridor. Gandhi's wife did not hear the news of the release at first, and met the sick car on the way, so she followed her husband to the Marble Palace.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Southern Ireland's Blue Shirt Team Meetings Under Surveillance <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Dublin, Reuters, 24th – General O'Duffy's Blue Shirt Team, i.e., the National Guard, is now resisting the government's order that the Blue Shirt Team is an illegal organization. This morning, in the town of Cothi Hill, 100 miles from here, some people openly wore Blue Shirt uniforms, walked in the streets, and went to the city council hall for O'Duffy's speech. The police were monitoring the meeting place but did not interfere or cause any disturbance. At the same time, Dublin is very quiet. The military court, which has the power to sentence Blue Shirt Team members to death, has now been organized. The reason why the current situation is unexpectedly calm is that the government does not want to start the conflict itself, causing the opposition to be justified. The government prohibits the search of arms, so the police will only take action against the National Guard when the Public Security Act is clearly endangered. During this hesitant period, those in the Blue Shirt Team who enjoy army pensions may withdraw, because once they are convicted by the military court, even for a minor crime, the pension will be revoked.</p>
<p>Dublin, National News Agency, 24th – It is rumored here that the Free State government will set up a Blue Shirt Team detention center near the capital. General O'Duffy said in a speech to the Blue Shirt Team representatives today that the National Guard (i.e., the Blue Shirt Team) now has 45,000 people. He believes that 20,000 people will participate in the parade in the Kirk area on Sunday. O'Duffy also said that the power in Kirk and the surrounding areas is now in the hands of the National Guard.</p>

<h3 id="e80">The War Zone is Still Not Fully Recovered <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Japan Refuses to Return Yuguan and Areas Outside the Great Wall</p>
<p>Bandits Run Rampant in the Xinglong Area, Our Police Force is Weak</p>
<p>Everything Will Be Negotiated With the Japanese Side After Huang Fu Returns to Beiping</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Beiping: Of the counties in the war zone, only Yuguan City and the county areas protruding beyond the Great Wall have not been agreed to be returned by the Japanese side. After the recovery of Miyun County, the areas outside the city have also not been taken over due to rampant bandits. The War Zone Reception Committee, Yin Tong, Tao Shangming, Liu Shisun, etc., considering that Huang Fu and Yu Xuezhong are not in Beiping, should urgently discuss a concrete plan for all outstanding and pending matters to facilitate their implementation. Therefore, it was decided to hold a meeting in Beiping within the next few days to jointly determine the direction. As for the continuing banditry in the war zone, the security police are finding it difficult to quell due to their limited strength. There are currently no preparations for the establishment of an administrative inspector for the war zone; everything will be resolved when Huang Fu returns to Beiping.</p>
<p>Yin Tong, a member of the War Zone Reception Committee, issued a statement yesterday, roughly saying that the lost territories in the war zone have been mostly recovered and that the handover of Ping and Yu can be completely resolved. However, the reception of Yuguan has not yet been realized, leading to many misunderstandings in the outside world. In fact, since the death of Japanese Army Commander Muto Nobuyoshi, everything has come to a standstill. Therefore, all unresolved matters must wait for Hishikari Takashi to take office before negotiations can continue. In the future, the return of Yuguan should not encounter any difficulties. As for the import tariffs on goods entering from outside the Guan and the entry of vehicles from the puppet Fengshan Railway into the Guan for transportation, these can also be resolved after some negotiation. In short, there should be no further complications in the future. However, banditry is rampant in the territories of various counties, especially in Xinglong and Malanyu, where it is extremely rampant. The police force dispatched by our side this time consists of only over 2,000 officers, with each county being allocated only two to three hundred officers, which is a rather weak number. The Hebei Provincial Government originally planned to allocate 9,000 police officers in the war zone, but the number currently allocated is far from that. Tracing back to the deployment of police forces by our side after the recovery of the lost territories, the Japanese side did not fix any restrictions during the ceasefire agreement. If banditry is allowed to spread in these disaster-stricken areas, the future will be unimaginable. On this point, it is highly hoped that the Hebei Provincial Government will promptly organize the police force, strengthen its strength, and then actively implement the suppression of banditry to bring peace to the people as soon as possible. The various passes along the Great Wall line are still guarded by the Japanese army, and the issue of their return will also need future negotiations to be effective, but this will have to wait until Chairman Huang and Chairman Yu return before there is a suitable negotiation approach.</p>
<p>Zhao Enqing and over twenty other representatives of the people from the counties of the Dongji Beizhan area submitted a petition, because bandits are rampant everywhere. If special agencies are not established to thoroughly suppress them, it is feared that the police force is too weak, and the situation may spread, and the future will be unimaginable. Therefore, they came to Beiping to visit the military and political authorities and explain everything in detail. Yesterday, Zhao Enqing spoke about the rampant banditry in various places, saying that there are currently many bandits in the Luandongxi area, who kill and plunder at will, and it is deeply feared that this will cause diplomatic problems. Therefore, they have come to Beiping to petition the Military Branch of the Political Readjustment Committee, and the results are quite satisfactory. Currently, the bandit situation along the border can be divided into ten groups: 1) The Funing area, led by bandits Weng Lingge, Rong Shan, and Si Haijiao, has several thousand men, plus the small groups of Qingshan and Da Wulong, which are also no less than seven or eight hundred men. 2) Dongyangsheng has over seven hundred men, entrenched outside Liujiakou, while Xilaihao, Kouwailouzi, and Da Shire, with five to six hundred men, are also based near Liujiakou. 3) The bandit leader Lao Haozi and the Lingyuan bandit Zhang Dahuzi are both recruiting about a thousand men in the Doushan area of Qinhuangdao, with seven or eight cannons and over ten machine guns. 4) Si Haile has over four hundred men, based in the Qingshan area of Funing, with complete firearms. The number of people in Funing city who have fled to avoid bandits has increased to over 20,000. 5) The Tangdao River in Doushan County has a group of bandits of about two thousand men, with a considerable force. The bandit leader is Ma Wu, named Cheng Zhang, who is from Da Zhangzi outside the Guan and has over forty machine guns, sixteen heavy cannons, and over ten handheld machine guns. This group was originally a mutiny from a certain army, so they have plenty of weapons and ammunition. 6) Scattered small groups are located in Nan Shagou and Xiangshuilue in Lulong, Fenshan and Fenghuangshan in Changli, Changling in Luan County, and the Haixia area in Laoting, with dozens, hundreds, or hundreds of people forming gangs and becoming very powerful. 7) Over two hundred bandits were found in the North Langzhuang in Henghe Town, Lulong County, who indiscriminately rob and plunder. 8) There are thirteen bandit gangs in the Xinglong County area, with the bandit leader Zuo Shandiao having about three thousand men and running rampant in the Luowenyu area of Zunhua. 9) There are over four thousand bandits in the Jixian County area, causing the most damage. The bandit leaders are Wan Renchou and Si Haihong, etc. 10) There are over two thousand bandits near Xifengkou and Saheqiao. It is heard that the Japanese army brigade commander Hattori has telegraphed Li Jichun to Yu to discuss ways to suppress the bandits, and our side is paying close attention to this. (Jin)</p>
<h3 id="e81">The Water Level in Western Shandong Rises, Xuzhou Repairs Dikes to Prevent Disasters <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The Water Level in Fengpei Drops, Already Out of Danger. The Provincial Government Dispatches Li Mingyang to Inspect Flood Prevention.</p>
<p>The Dike Repair Committee Builds a Ring-City Dike</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: The Xubu flood was fortunately averted, and the Fengpei flood has also been resolved. However, the water level in the upper reaches of western Shandong is rising daily, and the Xuzhou area is still not completely safe. Flood prevention work has not been relaxed at all, and post-disaster relief also needs to be addressed. Recently, the provincial government dispatched provincial committee member Li Mingyang to Xuzhou to inspect the water level and supervise flood prevention. The Dike Repair Committee is building a ring-city dike to prevent any eventuality. The situation of escaping danger and the recent situation of the water level are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e82">The Process of Fengpei Escaping Danger <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>The flooding of Fengpei by the Yellow River north of Xubu is due to the old river channel being higher than the terrain of Fengpei. The Dasha River, which connects the old channel and the Hui Lake, is a natural path for water drainage. Therefore, when the Yellow River headed north through the Dasha River on the morning of the 18th, it became torrential and unstoppable. The people of Fengpei initially wanted to build a dam on Gaozhai, but seeing that the Yellow River was irrigating the Dasha River, it had a high vantage point. The water was swift, and the river was narrow, causing head-on collisions. Dangerous lateral flows occurred at sharp bends. Huashan, Songlou, Baimiaokou, Fengji, etc., in Feng County, which are 12 miles away from the city, and Loulou, Youfangkou, Panlongji, etc., in Pei County, which are more than ten miles away from the city, are important junctions for the Dasha River to bypass the west side of Pei City and enter Zhaoyang Lake. The water flow was particularly rapid. Therefore, on the 18th and 19th, Feng City felt extremely dangerous, and Pei City was even more likely to be threatened. Fortunately, the water flow reached Zhaoyang Lake on the evening of the 19th, and the people of Fengpei were relieved. Zhaoyang Lake is connected to Weishan Lake and has always been a place for storing water. It is connected to Nanyang Lake in southern Shandong. Normally, the lake water is low and shallow, and the dry land on the shore is a great benefit to Pei County. The reason why the people of Fengpei previously dredged the Dasha River was to provide water for irrigation. They did not expect that the backflow of the Yellow River would cause harm. After the Yellow River entered Weishan Lake, it was stored, and the upstream source decreased. The old site of Dangshan has reported a drop in the water level, and the water overflowing the banks of the Dasha River has returned to the channel. However, the flooded fields have been completely submerged, and the disaster cannot be reversed. The county chiefs of Fengpei are trying their best to ensure the safety of the urban area and are particularly concerned about the recurrence of floods. Prevention has not stopped. Relief for the flooded rural areas has not yet begun, but the water in Weishan Lake has increased compared to before, and the lake fields have also been flooded. Fortunately, it has not yet overflowed the banks. If the water from western Shandong enters Weishan Lake again, Weishan Lake may also overflow, which is what the people of Fengpei are most worried about.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Investigation of the Water Level in the Upper Reaches <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The source of the Yellow River in Xuzhou this time is all in the upper reaches of western Shandong. She Nianci investigated the downstream after flood prevention to prepare for further prevention. Mr. Tian initially arrived in Yanzhou via Jining, and then went to Jiaxiang from Jining. When he went to Juye from Jiaxiang on the 20th, he encountered the Yellow River on the way, and traffic was cut off. So he returned to Jiaxiang. He telegraphed She that the water in western Shandong was too high to trace back to Heze. He returned to Xuzhou on the 22nd. According to his report, the source of the Yellow River was all due to the breach of the river in Dongming, with a breach of more than fifty feet and a water depth of more than ten feet. The momentum was extremely fierce and rushed eastward, dividing into three streams. One stream in the northeast goes straight to Jining, and it will enter the canal. One stream in the east passes through Juye Jiaxiang and will rush to Weishan Lake. One stream in the southeast floods to Cao Dan, turning to enter Zhaoyang. The one in the northeast flows down the Zhao Wang River, the one in the east flows down the Zhu River, and the one in the southeast flows down the Wanfu River. Although the above rivers have river channels to follow, the water is too swift, and the river channels are narrow, overflowing everywhere and causing great harm. The Grand Canal connects to Weishan Lake. The Grand Canal passes between Jiangsu and Shandong, and Weishan Lake is the place for storage and drainage. Zhaoyang is connected to Weishan Lake. Although they are called two lakes, they are actually one. If all the water pours into Wei, northern Jiangsu will become a swamp. On the 21st and 22nd, Jia and Ju also received telegrams, Yuncheng was surrounded by the Yellow River, and the water outside the gates of Ju City was vast, and Jiaxiang was also feared to be unavoidable. Currently, all telegrams to the counties in western Shandong are forwarded by the Xuzhou Bureau to Guide and Cao County. The traffic to western Shandong is almost completely cut off, and the water is so vast that it has destroyed poles and damaged lines, and there is no way to repair them. The postal service has long been suspended, and the magnitude of the water can be imagined. As for how dangerous northern Jiangsu will be in the future, it is still unpredictable.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Preventing Downstream Floods <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>The only place that the Yellow River passed through in the west of Xubu is the old river channel between Fengpei and Xiaoai. The harm is only in the Yellow River. To the east of it are the old river channel of Pisuicui, and the Grand Canal. The old river has been silted for a long time, and the Grand Canal has also been abandoned for a long time. There is also the problem of transport water. Therefore, when the Yellow River came east, the authorities repeatedly telegraphed here to inquire. As the reporter said in his previous letter, after the Yellow River enters Wei, the disaster in the lower reaches will not be the Yellow River but the transport water. Now, the water in western Shandong will all take Weishan Lake as a teacher. If the water level of Wei rises, it will flow down along the transport, and Pisuicui will bear the brunt. After She Nianci sent a telegram to various counties to prevent floods, all counties have been prepared. Among them, Suqian County is the most disadvantaged, because the Yellow River Canal passes through Suqian City. Therefore, County Chief Feng once said that the Yellow River and the Canal came together, and the only thing to do was to wait for death. Moreover, the two rivers sandwiched the city, and the siltation has been for a long time. The bottom is high and the ground is low. Even if 200,000 people are recruited, they will not be able to block it. Fortunately, the water level has slowed down, and Feng has convened local flood prevention, and decided to rush to repair the Yellow River, the Canal, the Yang River, the Zao River, and the branch river dikes. There are city dikes, Si Cao dams, Yaowan dikes, Guanjiazhuang, Xu Taoyuan, etc. Each dike, and the various culverts of Chengxiang, Zhang Yao, He Zhuang, and Xiwu, all ten districts of the county, mobilized 26,000 workers to rush to repair them day and night. Pi reported that the water level had not risen greatly. However, according to the people in western Shandong and near the lake, according to previous experience, the water in western Shandong must flow through Wei for ten days before reaching it. Then the water from the three streams in western Shandong will have to wait several days before reaching Wei. After entering Wei, depending on the size of the water and the height of the water storage in Weishan Lake, it will be able to irrigate the Canal and flow downstream. The areas along the Canal can take advantage of this time to plan well and prevent things from happening.</p>
<h3 id="e85">The Provincial Government Dispatches Personnel to Prevent Floods <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The provincial government attaches great importance to the floods in northern Jiangsu. Since Li Mingyang, a member of the Provincial Committee, is from Xuzhou, he was specially dispatched to Xuzhou to inspect flood prevention. Li arrived in Xuzhou on the morning of the 22nd by train from Pingpu. Accompanying him were item engineers from the Construction Department and Sangke members from the Security Department. After getting off the train, he stayed at the Garden Hotel. At that time, he accompanied She Nianci, the administrative commissioner of the twelfth district, and Wang Shicai, the director of the Public Security Bureau, in a car to Fengpei to inspect. He set off at 9:00 a.m. Before leaving, Li told reporters that the Yellow River in western Shandong had breached its banks and flooded northern Jiangsu. The reports from various counties were very serious. Therefore, the provincial government sent me to conduct on-the-spot inspections. This trip will go to Pei to inspect the water level of the Dasha River, then to Weishan Lake to inspect, and then to Feng County to inspect. After the Fengpei survey is completed, we will wait for the Yellow River to be surveyed in the old Yellow River channel in Gaozhai, Dangshan, and the water levels of Xiaoxian County. After the survey of the counties is completed, we will follow the downstream to survey the counties of Su, Pi, and Cui, focusing on flood control, and aiming to prevent or reduce floods in northern Jiangsu. It is checked that Mr. Li is familiar with the situation in Xuzhou, so he will be able to prevent everything. The people may be in danger of the fish. Commissioner She also reported to Li on the local flood prevention, rescue, and plans to completely repair the ring city dike, and requested the province to allocate funds. The Xuzhou group also plans to wait for Li to inspect and return to Xuzhou to meet with him and suggest that the provincial government allocate a large amount of water conservancy funds to repair the big dike, which will be a one-time solution.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Dike Repair Committee Meeting <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Before the flood on the 15th, a committee was established to repair the Yellow River Dike. After the rescue, a meeting was held yesterday to decide to completely repair the ring city dike with all our strength, and block the road and Pipa Mountain dam to prevent the south irrigation of Weishan Lake, and replenish the dike of Wangzha Tianqimiao to resist the east encroachment of the west water. The army for rescue was given pig wine as a reward. After the dike is completed, we will continue to plan for the thorough dredging of the river in the territory. In the past, the counties were governed by themselves, and the interests of each other were conflicting. Now that the administrative area belongs to the twelfth district, we can plan comprehensively. I remember that in the 20th year of the Republic of China, the city of Xuzhou was flooded, and after the groups rescued and prevented the disaster, a commemorative stele of water disasters was published, pointing out the most details. The stele has also been published, and here is the inscription of the stele: "Xuzhou Water Disaster Precept Stele, in the summer of the 20th year of the Republic of China, the Xuzhou River was flooded and the embankment was broken. The residents were terrified. On August 7th, there was another heavy rain, and the water was three feet deep on the plain. The houses were floating. By dusk, it was suddenly reported that the embankment had broken in four or five places, and the water was about to enter the city. Everyone was shocked and ran away, not knowing where to go. Fortunately, officials and people rushed to block the embankment day and night, and it did not collapse completely. However, they were afraid that disaster was coming, and it has not ended yet. The Yellow River has been a disaster for Xuzhou for more than a thousand years. The dikes and defenses were the most solid. After the river moved, the officials and people loved and protected it without slackening. For the past eighty years, it has never been a disaster. This summer's rainfall is equal to that of ten years ago, and the danger is so great. The reason is that the local area has not paid attention to it for years, and there are few long-term plans. If it can be profitable in the present, it will open roads, build roads, flatten Guo, fill rivers, destroy dikes, and decide banks regardless. Therefore, some people use embankment stones to build roads, some people build tombs, some people take advantage of the opportunity to steal and sell them, and some people build houses along the banks. The embankment of thousands of years to protect the city and the stone bank built by millions of dollars will be destroyed in a few years. Internal and external blockages have almost caused a great disaster. Isn't it strange? The past is over, and the future can be pursued. However, at the beginning of the water retreat, people have not forgotten the disaster, or they still know the precepts. If they delay a few years, they will forget again. Those with foresight and long-term plans have also been vigilant and have considered this, but in the end, there is no remedy for the destroyers. The harm is gone, and people are easy to neglect. This association punishes the past and strives to maintain the status quo, and hopes to complete the embankment and dredge the river in the shortest possible time to eliminate water disasters and ensure eternal peace. If there is no regard for public hazards, arbitrarily blocking the river and deciding the embankment, it will be reported to the competent authorities for strict detention and punishment. Therefore, this stele is built to show the precepts. The gentleman of the country, please encourage each other." From this inscription, we can know the depth of the water disaster, but the dike defense is incomplete due to the lack of funds. How long has it been, and the water police reported again. This time, the meeting of the dike repair decided to complete the work of the great dike. I think the provincial government will have something to help with. (23rd)</p>

<p>The Disaster Area in Heze Accounts for Four-Ninths of the County</p>
<p>The Provincial Relief Association Asks for a Portion of the National Tax to be Used for Relief</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Han Fuqu, Chairman of the Provincial Government and Chairman of the Provincial Relief Association, yesterday received a telegram from Wang Jiayan, County Chief of Yuncheng County, stating that the Yellow River has arrived in the county. It is also reported that Wang Shaochang, Deputy Dean of the Heze Rural Construction Institute, reported that the disaster in Heze was extremely severe, and the disaster area accounted for four-fifths of the county. Han believed that relief and assistance were the most urgent needs at present, so he telegraphed the National Government and the Executive Yuan again to request relief. The Provincial Relief Association also telegraphed the Central Government, requesting that, starting from the 22nd year, 10% of the national tax revenue in Shandong be retained for the purpose of saving the massive disaster. The various telegrams are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Han sent a telegram to President Wang of the Executive Yuan, addressed to Executive Yuan President Wang Junjian, reporting repeatedly that the disaster situation in the counties of western Shandong was extremely severe, and asking urgently for prompt relief. I received your telegram stating that the Yuanhui decided that the Ministry of Finance should first transfer the unpaid amount of 600,000 yuan from the Yangzi River Flood Prevention Committee. Millions of lives in western Shandong are drifting and displaced, and their cries are everywhere. Relief cannot be delayed. I can only telegraph again and ask your Lordship to quickly order the Ministry of Finance to prepare the funds as soon as possible to save the survivors. I am grateful and awaiting orders. Sincerely, Han Fuqu bowed.</p>
<p>Han sent a telegram to Jiang, Wang, Lin, etc., addressed to Chairman Jiang of Guling, Executive Yuan President Wang, Chairman of the National Government Lin, Minister of Interior Huang, stating that the flood situation in the counties of western Shandong has been reported in detail. It is now based on the telegram from Wang Jiayan, County Chief of Cheng County, that the Yellow River arrived at the border at noon and flowed east in two streams, with the shallowest being two feet deep and the deepest being more than one zhang deep, and the current was turbulent. Also, according to Wang Shaochang, Deputy Dean of the Rural Construction Research Institute, the current flood disaster is extremely severe, and the area flooded in Heze accounts for four-fifths of the county, with more than a thousand villages completely submerged, and about 300,000 people affected, living in the open and lacking food, which is unbearable to witness. Please quickly telegraph the National Government to have mercy on the victims and provide generous relief. In addition to ordering the government to do its best to rescue them, I would like to report this telegram for your review and order relief to save the people. Sincerely, Han Fuqu bowed.</p>
<p>The telegram from the Provincial Relief Association to the National Government Executive Yuan Central Relief Association: Shandong Province has repeatedly reported the tragic situation to Han Fuqu, Chairman of Shandong Province and Chairman of this Association, and has asked for the rapid issuance of relief funds. It is checked that the river disaster came suddenly. Although this province has been able to prevent disasters by managing the river, other provinces have made the neighboring country a gully by breaching its banks. In addition, continuous yin rain and flooding have made dozens of counties and countless people into a swamp in a few days. Telegrams are requesting relief and awaiting orders. This association is in charge of relief and has an inescapable responsibility, but the relief funds have been suspended by the Ministry of Finance for a long time, and the requests have not been approved by the Central Government. Repeated calls have been ineffective. This association has no rice to cook, and the victims cannot be left to die. In addition to doing our best to plan and distribute emergency relief, all aspects of rescue, accommodation, prevention, and rehabilitation cannot be achieved without a large amount of relief funds. Please have compassion for the victims, quickly issue a large amount of funds, and also check the repeated telegrams from this association, and follow the provisions of the Premier's Outline of Nation Building to retain at least 10% of the national tax to handle local charities. Please allow 10% of the national tax revenue in Shandong to be retained for the rescue of the massive disaster, starting from the 22nd year, in order to help the people, which is extremely urgent. Shandong Provincial Relief Association Standing Committee members Li Shuchun, Zhao Xinru, Xin Zhujiu, Committee member Zhang Zicun, He Supu bowed. (23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e88">Military Tension in Northern Fujian Suppressing Bandits <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Fierce Battles for Days, Over Five Thousand Red Bandits Killed or Wounded</p>
<p>Lu and Liu's Divisions Successively Recovered Mingxi and Tai Ning</p>
<p>Cai Tingkai Flew to Zhangzhou on the 15th to Command</p>
<p>The Counties in Northern Fujian Have Had Poor Harvests, and Refugees Are in Dire Need of Relief</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Since being besieged by the Central Army, the Red Bandits in eastern Jiangxi retreated into northern Fujian and successively fell into Chong'an, Guangze, Taining, Jianning, Ninghua, Mingxi, Qingliu, Liancheng, and other counties. The situation in the upper reaches of the Minjiang River suddenly became tense. Later, the Liu Heding, Lu Xingbang, Zhou Zhiqun, Ma Hongxing, Nie Jinlong and other troops, guarded Jianyang, Shaowu, Jiangle, Shaxian, Yong'an, Pucheng, and other counties, and fought fiercely with the bandits. This went on for half a month. The Qu Shounian Division of the 19th Route Army also opened from Liancheng into Yong'an to coordinate defense, and the bandits began to fail. Among them, the Qu Division in the Liancheng area, the Lu Division in the Mingxi area, and the Liu Division in the Taining area had the fiercest battles. From August 1st to 10th, it is estimated that more than 5,000 bandits were killed or wounded. Our army also suffered considerable losses. Currently, Mingxi and Taining have been successively recovered by the Lu and Liu divisions, and the bandits have retreated to Qingliu and Jianning. The Qu Division has also advanced to the border of Liancheng for deployment.</p>
<p>Recently, the bandits changed their course to western Fujian due to repeated setbacks in northern Fujian. On the 13th, they attacked Longyan from Liancheng. In recent days, they have been in fierce battle with the Shen Guanghan and Zhang Yan divisions of the 19th Route Army. Cai Tingkai took off from the provincial capital on the 15th to fly to Zhangzhou to command, because the military situation in the front was urgent. The situation in northern Fujian has become more relaxed. However, since the beginning of this year, the counties in northern Fujian have suffered from drought and no rain, and the summer harvest has been hopeless. The areas producing rice in the Yanjanshao three counties used to transport Xi rice to the province for sale, but this year they have to come to the province to purchase sea rice and send it for relief. Now, at the time of the autumn harvest, they have suffered from banditry again. The farmers have fled to each other, and the fields have been left barren. Currently, tens of thousands of refugees in the bandit areas have fled to Jianyang, Shunchang, Jian'ou, and Jiangle. They are waiting to be fed. The county governments are unable to provide food and want to send them to the province. The Civil Affairs Department heard the news and urgently telegraphed to stop them, ordering them to set up shelters on the spot and allowing the province to allocate funds for relief. As for the refugees who have already arrived in the province, they were ordered to work with the various charities in Minhou County to find ways to provide relief. (August 17th)</p>

He has been escorted to Suzhou and is being held in the Anti-Banditry Department's Investigation Team, pending interrogation. Captain Xu also discovered that Xue San, an accomplice of Jiang Minsheng, was hiding in the Zheng San Shipyard in Yangjing Town, Shanghai. He immediately led detectives Yu Lianyuan and others to Shanghai and arrested Xue San and Xue Wang at the destination. He is temporarily detained at the Second Branch of the Third District of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau and will be escorted to Suzhou for interrogation today (25th).</p>

<h3 id="e92">Appeal of the Changshu Murder Case Concluded <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Last year, on July 20th, Yan Hongqing of the fourth district of Changshu, Shazhou City, and Jiang Qinsheng, who was a drill instructor in the local militia, caught his wife, Jiang Wang, having an affair with Yu Sanbao. The adulterous couple strangled Jiang Qinsheng to death on the 11th of the same month and buried his body in a mud pit in an attempt to cover up the crime. Later, Jiang Lisheng, the victim's brother, saw a pack of dogs digging at the mud pit and discovered the body. When he questioned his sister-in-law and nephew, Xiao Ying, they both claimed that Jiang Wang and Yu Sanbao had strangled Jiang Qinsheng. Jiang Lisheng reported the crime, and the Public Security Bureau arrested the adulterous couple, who confessed to the county government. The county sentenced both to death. They refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Jiangsu High Court. Yesterday, Hu Shancheng, the judge of the Second Criminal Court, presided over the trial. Jiang Lisheng, the deceased's brother, and witnesses Gu Gaoer also appeared as summoned. The initial interrogation of Jiang Wang revealed that she was 38 years old. Her confession in Changshu was obtained under duress and was not factual. She denied being an accomplice. Yu Sanbao, 32 years old, also vehemently protested his innocence, denying any intimate relationship with Jiang Wang or involvement in the conspiracy to strangle Jiang Qinsheng. After the witnesses Gu Gaoer testified, Prosecutor Zhan Fen stood up and argued that the facts of the case had already been admitted by Jiang Wang and Yu Sanbao in the first trial and could not be denied. The death sentence was appropriate. After a lawyer presented a defense, the court declared the debate closed and scheduled the verdict for the 30th.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Female Worker Attempts Suicide, Moves Corpse to Frame <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Tang Xiaomei, a 25-year-old unmarried female worker at the Gansheng Silk Factory under Gongyun Bridge, was of a fierce and impulsive nature. On the morning of the 21st of this month, she had an argument with Zhang, another female worker in the factory. Around noon the day before yesterday, Xiaomei gathered other female workers like A-cai and waited near the ferry crossing near the factory. When Zhang Qian arrived at the factory for work, they confronted her and violently beat her. Zhang Qian was pregnant and the assault caused her to be severely injured. Afterwards, her husband, Zhang Zhixiang, negotiated with Tang Xiaomei. Eventually, Xiaomei's brother, Ren Gen, apologized to Zhang on behalf of his sister, settling the matter. However, Tang Xiaomei was fired by the factory. Angered, Xiaomei committed suicide by drinking sedative water. Her family discovered her too late to save her. Her brother, Tang Ren Gen, believed that the incident stemmed from the argument with Zhang Qian. He blamed Zhang Qian and, yesterday morning (the 24th), hired workers to move the body to Zhang Qian's house at 9 Beicangmen. Zhang Qian was terrified upon seeing this and immediately reported the incident to Xi Xuechang, the head of the 13th Tu in that area, who reported it to the court for inspection. She plans to accuse the Tang family of moving the corpse to frame her.</p>

<p>Gu Yunsheng, a 36-year-old villager from Shangtang Village, Wusan Tu, about three miles from Anzhen in the eighth district (Huai Township), lost his father early in life. His mother, Zhang, could not bear her widowhood and secretly became intimate with Ding Enrong, a local thug. Yunsheng discovered the affair and advised his mother kindly. Zhang felt that the affair was exposed, and it was a matter of face. She went to Suzhou to work as a maid. However, Ding Enrong hated Gu to the core. Gu's wife, Zhang, who was past her youth, also felt that her husband was not handsome and that there was a wide age gap between them. She also became intimate with Sun Awu (27 years old), a villager. They secretly met from time to time. On the 20th of last month, Gu came to the city to buy goods and returned home late at night. He saw a dark figure rushing out of the door. He questioned Zhang sternly, but Zhang made excuses. The next day, Zhang conspired with her lover, Ah Wu, and asked Enrong to help them kill Gu Yunsheng. Enrong hated Gu and was bribed with money from Ah Wu. He agreed to assist the adulterous couple in killing Gu. On the 30th, around 11:00 PM, Zhang took off her clothes and opened the door to let Sun Awu and Ding Enrong into the house while her husband was asleep. Zhang stuffed cotton into her husband's mouth, Ah Wu held down his legs, and Enrong used a hemp rope to strangle him to death. Afterwards, they tied a large stone to the body and threw it into the nearby river to cover up the crime. At 11:00 AM on the 23rd, a water-pumping boat turned on its machine and passed through the area. The body was dislodged and floated to the surface. The incident was reported to the 16th Branch of the Public Security Bureau. Chief Tan of the branch received the report and led police officers to investigate. He hired a net boat to retrieve the body. The entire body was naked and had not yet decomposed. There was a hemp rope tied around the waist, and there were marks on the neck from the strangulation. The adulterous woman, Gu Zhang, the adulterer, Sun Awu, and the accomplice, Ding Enrong, were all arrested and interrogated. They confessed to conspiring to kill Gu Yunsheng. The bureau chief believed it was a major murder case, so yesterday (the 24th), the three criminals were transferred to the County Public Security Bureau for interrogation. After the case occurred, Tu Hezheng Pu Zhongying reported it to the county court, requesting an inspection.</p>

<p>Wang Xiaoan, a police detective from the Taicang County Public Security Bureau, falsely accused Yu Junhai of being a bandit from Taicang because of a dispute over his mistress, He Guixiang.

<p>The riverbank of Nantong collapsed greatly. The Yangtze River Waterway Management Committee advocated that local capabilities should be used first to maintain the twelve embankments that have not collapsed, so that the collapsed shoreline would not be prolonged and expanded. Since the lower reaches of the Yangtze River are a whole problem, the central government decided that engineers from the United States and America would draw up a plan to protect the areas that have collapsed below Jiangyin and develop the areas that have risen to fix a water channel for the Yangtze River. The construction cost is estimated to be 3.5 million yuan.</p>

Although discussions were held, no results were obtained. The union then petitioned the party and government organs for mediation. It is heard that the county party headquarters, to understand the situation of both parties, recently summoned labor and capital to separate talks. Both parties sent representatives to state their cases. After these talks, the department will hold the first labor-capital mediation meeting in the coming days to avoid disputes.</p>

<p>The China Land Reclamation Bank has set up an office in Yuguan Street, Yuyao, to circulate funds in the interior and help rural revitalization. It opened today (the 24th). Qin Runqing, chairman and general manager of the bank, and Yu Zuochen, manager of the Ningbo branch, personally came to Yao to preside over the opening ceremony. Congratulatory messages from all walks of life poured in. Yuyao is the main cotton producing area in eastern Zhejiang. The annual output is worth 10 million silver yuan. The Zihai area is especially rich in salt benefits, and the straw hat cords woven by women are also a major export product of eastern Zhejiang. In recent years, the domestic financial situation has been stagnant and the market has been depressed. The bank is extremely willing to do its best to help the revival of the rural economy.</p>

<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Security Department determined that the Red Bandit Ren Boxiang (aka Ren Changxun) was originally engaged in kidnapping and killing in Yongkang and committed numerous crimes. In November of the 19th year of the Republic [1930], he surrendered to seek self-renewal, which was approved by the county and reported to the provincial government. In October of last year, Ren relapsed and, together with Ying Zhiying and A-ming from Taimen, resumed activities. They carried firearms to Xianju to collude with the bandit leader "Quezui Hong". When they returned to Yongkang and passed through Cao Dian in Xianju, they attempted robbery. The local militia caught them on the spot and shot Ying A-ming and Feng Mingdai to death, seizing one wooden-cased gun. Cao Dawang, a member of the militia, was injured and killed by the bandits. The case was sent to the Fifth Regiment and then to the Provincial Security Department. Interrogation revealed that the criminal joined the Red Army, committed murder and arson, and continued to collude with traitors and endanger the Republic and disrupt public order after his self-renewal. The evidence was conclusive and he was sentenced to death. Yesterday (the 24th) at 9:00 AM, he was taken to the execution ground outside Qingbo Gate and executed by firing squad.</p>

<p>Denies Government's Change in Diplomatic Policy</p>
<p>Envoy Jiang Zuobin Will Not Return for Time Being</p>
<p>Finance Minister Song May Have Social Engagements in Japan; No Telegram Received</p>
<p>Tang Youren, the newly appointed Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, accompanied by Madame Chen Bijun, the wife of President Wang, and Minister of Railways Zeng Zhongming, on the overnight train from Nanjing. At 10:00 AM yesterday morning, Mr. Tang met with reporters from various newspapers at his residence and firmly denied the rumors that the Central Government's diplomatic policy had changed. He also stated that Envoy Jiang Zuobin would not be returning to his post for the time being. Mr. Tang, along with Zeng Zhongming, Yu Youren, Zhang Zhijiang, and others, took the overnight train to Nanjing last night. Mr. Tang's remarks are summarized as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e105">Diplomatic Policy Unchanged <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Rumors have been circulating in Nanjing and Shanghai in recent days that the Central Government's diplomatic policy has undergone some changes. Mr. Tang firmly denied these rumors. According to Mr. Tang, Minister Luo is scheduled to depart for Singapore tomorrow (the 25th). During Minister Luo's absence, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will be temporarily headed by President Wang concurrently. However, the Central Government's foreign policy remains the same and will not change. As for my visit to the Japanese Ambassador to China, Akira Ariyoshi, a few days ago, it was purely a matter of personal courtesy and did not involve any specific mission. The Japanese Ambassador had previously visited Nanjing, so I took the opportunity to return to Shanghai last week and paid a return visit to Ambassador Ariyoshi.</p>

<p>Regarding the question of the return of Envoy Jiang Zuobin to Japan, some people at the Lushan Conference asked Mr. Jiang to return to his post as soon as possible. However, Mr. Jiang himself is unwilling to return for the time being. Therefore, the rumors that Mr. Jiang would return to Shanghai from Lushan and travel east in early September are not true.</p>

<p>Finance Minister Song Ziwen is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 29th aboard the President Jefferson of the Dollar Steamship Lines. A Reuters dispatch stated that Mr. Song, led by Zhang Gongquan, General Manager of the Bank of China, will visit various figures in Japanese political and business circles while returning to China. This is not the case. The Central Government has not received any telegram from Mr. Song stating that he will visit Japanese authorities. However, in accordance with international protocol, it is possible that he may attend social engagements ashore.</p>

<p>The use of the US wheat loan should be carefully studied. Regarding the Reuters dispatch stating that the US side expressed dissatisfaction that the Chinese government would use this loan to order machinery from the UK and Germany, Mr. Tang stated that he found this incomprehensible. Although the Central Government has not yet decided on the use of this loan for construction purposes, it still needs to be discussed in detail after Finance Minister Song returns to China.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Liu's Appointment to Europe Confirmed <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The reporter then inquired whether the rumor of the former Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Liu Chongjie being appointed as envoy was true. Mr. Tang replied that the rumor that Mr. Liu would be sent abroad was indeed true. However, whether he would be appointed as envoy has not yet been determined, as the appointment of foreign envoys requires the prior consent of the host country. What I can tell you is that Mr. Liu has been confirmed to be appointed to Europe. As for which country, it will be officially announced after the consent of the host country has been obtained.</p>

Therefore, the preparatory committee held its fourth meeting yesterday and decided to hold the ceremony on September 9th. The location was also changed to Hongqiao Airport. The details are as follows:</p>

Therefore, I immediately reported to the preparatory committee and decided on the date. It is also learned that the five aircraft will take off from Hangzhou and arrive in Shanghai on the morning of that day.

<h3 id="e118">Shanghai County Party Headquarters Cables Opposition to Continued Winter Grain Tax <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Demands Unified Stance</p>
<p>According to Daily News, the Shanghai County Party Headquarters has expressed strong opposition to the Jiangsu Provincial Government's recent request to the central government to continue levying an additional two yuan per picul of winter grain tax this year. It has also telegraphed all county party headquarters and agencies in the province, demanding a unified stance and joint efforts to fight for the interests of the people of Jiangsu. The original telegram is transcribed below: To all county party headquarters, directly affiliated district party headquarters, county public fund and property management offices, county food management committees, and county chambers of commerce in Jiangsu Province: It is well known that the land tax in our province is the highest in the country. In recent years, the amount of various taxes levied on each county's fields has already exceeded several times the regular tax. Although the name of labor tax has been abolished and changed to land value tax, it has in fact exceeded the late Premier Sun's legacy of one percent taxation on every hundred yuan in value. Moreover, in recent years, the rural economy has continued to decline, and the farmers' livelihoods have become more difficult. Land value has decreased rather than increased, and the government is seeking relief. However, it was recently heard that the Jiangsu Provincial Government has again requested the central government to continue levying an additional two yuan per picul of winter grain tax this year. Upon hearing this, we were greatly surprised. This additional levy originated during the Sun Chuanfang era and was called "borrowed grain tax". At that time, there was a clear statement that it would be deducted in the following year. In the 17th year [1928], it was continued for one year and renamed "Northern Expedition Donation". In the 18th year [1929], it was originally discontinued. In the 19th year [1930], the provincial government used the pretext of provincial treasury shortages to request and approve its continuation for one year. The glorious laws clearly stated that it would only be collected for one year and would not be extended. Unexpectedly, year after year, the government repeatedly broke its promises to the people. Speaking of this, we cannot help but feel disappointed. Now, low grain prices are hurting farmers, and farmers' income is barely enough to survive. As a result, they are abandoning farmland and flocking to the cities. The countryside has become bankrupt. Our central government is organizing a Rural Reconstruction Commission to plan for relief. Local governments should reduce taxes and levies to alleviate the people's plight. How can they act perversely, imposing extra taxes outside the law? The county party headquarters feels that the situation is critical and cannot remain silent. Therefore, it is submitting this document to your organization for review and verification. In accordance with our party's commitment to protecting farmers, we urge you to promptly forward this to the central government and the National Government, ordering the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance to strictly reject the Jiangsu Provincial Government's request to continue levying additional grain tax in order to alleviate the farmers' hardships and prevent rural bankruptcy. This is the duty of the Party. I hereby send this telegram, hoping that you will unite in advocacy and struggle to protect the people of Jiangsu and alleviate the hardships of farmers. Ma, Executive Committee of the Kuomintang Jiangsu Provincial Committee, Shanghai County.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Yao Wen-nan's Two Submissions <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai gentleman Yao Wen-nan submitted a petition to the Municipal Government regarding land value tax and housing rental rules, stating his concerns. The following is a record of the submissions:</p>
<p>Submission One: A Petition Regarding the Implementation of Land Value Tax in This City, Which Property Owners Cannot Afford, Humbly Requesting Approval for Delayed Implementation to Alleviate the People's Hardships and Align with Public Sentiment. It has recently been reported multiple times that your government has announced the "Provisional Land Value Tax Regulations for This City," along with detailed implementation rules and organizational regulations for the valuation committee. The tax rate is set at six per thousand, and the tax collection date is set to begin on August 1st of this year. Upon hearing this, property owners have expressed their dismay. They believe that land consolidation is a policy of unifying tax revenue initiated by the late Premier Sun Yat-sen. The central government will have comprehensive plans for this policy in the future and should have a holistic approach. Currently, the Land Law has not been implemented. The central government also considers this matter significant and emphasizes caution, so it has not yet issued a unified national tax rate. However, this city is urgently announcing this separate law, setting a national precedent, which is unfair to the people's burden. Moreover, in civilized countries, any increase in the people's burden must be approved by a representative body of public opinion before it can be implemented. The Provisional Municipal Assembly of this city has already been established. Although many assembly members are from other provinces, they are all respected figures of the time and have the qualifications to represent the people. Although this land value tax measure has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval by your government, it has not been decided by the representative assembly of public opinion, and there is no obligation to bear the burden according to the law. Furthermore, since Shanghai experienced the war of January 28th, it has not yet recovered. It is hoping for time to recuperate and rebuild, and there is no surplus capacity to increase the burden. Upon investigation, the tax rate for the land value tax collection is much higher than the original land tax. The amount has increased several times in small cases, and tens or hundreds of times in large cases. After the people have experienced great trauma, the sudden direct increase of such a burden is beyond the capacity of the people. Even in terms of the currently promulgated land value tax collection measures, the land price is determined by the property owner. This was seen in the late Premier Sun Yat-sen's instructions. However, upon examining the detailed rules for the implementation of the provisional land value tax collection regulations, although the property owner also reports, the land price is actually determined arbitrarily by the valuation committee. Moreover, the members of the committee are all section chiefs from your government and its subordinate bureaus. Citizens have no right to participate in representation. With such measures, the prices determined in the future may not be fair. If the price is not fair and citizens are hastily required to fulfill their tax obligations, who will be willing? Isn't it only right to investigate whether tax collection is fair? This is an easy principle in economics. In 1929, your government announced the conversion of the general tax into a housing tax, collected equally from landlords and tenants. At that time, it was repeatedly stated that this was a transitional measure before the promulgation of the land tax. In the future, after the land tax law is promulgated, the landlord will bear the land tax, and the tenant will bear the housing tax. This is not only seen in the instructions of the former Director of the Finance Bureau, but also specified in Article 4 of the Housing Tax Collection Regulations of this city. Now, the land value tax has been scheduled to start collection, but how the housing tax collection method will be changed has not been announced at the same time. Property owners are very suspicious, and the autumn housing tax has already started to be collected. However, the method of equal sharing between landlord and tenant remains the same. The special levy has lost the credibility of the citizens and has placed a double burden on our property owners, which is unfair to the principle of equal taxation. All of these are things that our citizens cannot accept. I have always admired the mayor for his compassion for the people's hardships and his attention to detail. We believe that the time for this land value tax has not yet arrived. Therefore, we have jointly stated the reasons and submitted a written request to your government for review and approval to delay the implementation to alleviate the people's hardships and align with public sentiment. We are extremely anxious to await your orders. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Government.</p>
<p>Submission Two: A Petition Regarding the Promulgation of Housing Rental Rules in This City, Which Are Difficult to Implement, Humbly Requesting Approval for Repeal to Avoid Disputes. It has recently been reported that your government has promulgated seventeen articles of the "Housing Rental Rules for This City," which have been scheduled to take effect on August 1st. Upon hearing this, citizens have expressed their doubts and suspicions. It is generally believed that the promulgation of these rules is due to the difficulty in resolving rental disputes in this city, so this measure is specially set up to provide relief. It is the authorities' great intention to protect the rights of our property owners. If it is beneficial to promote in terms of law and fact, our property owners will all offer incense and prayers. However, upon reviewing the content, the entire judiciary is suspected of being fragmented. For example, guarantee of debt, termination of real estate lease contracts, etc., the civil law promulgated by the central government has clearly stipulated that it is purely within the scope of the judiciary and absolutely cannot be encroached upon by administrative authority. Moreover, upon investigating the guarantee responsibility stipulated in the rules, it is limited to two months' rent. If the landlord declares termination of the contract and orders the tenant to move out, three months' notice must be given in advance, and various restrictions such as exemption from two or three months' rent must be given. This means that the rental conditions and period completely lose the freedom of contract and clearly contradict the spirit of the current civil law. Even regarding the crackdown on rent arrears, according to the original Rule 4, if the tenant owes rent for three months, it should be handled according to Rule 13. However, Rule 13 states that if the tenant owes rent for more than three months, the police district should be reported to handle it according to these rules. However, after reviewing the entire text of the rules, there are no regulations on any method. Such vague wording is somewhat ridiculous. As a result, there is still no effective solution to rental disputes, and our property owners are at a loss. This is difficult to implement in terms of law and fact. Furthermore, upon investigation, the rent book stipulated in Rule 2 is stipulated to be purchased by the landlord from the police district in charge. However, now the police station in each district has sent police to sell this rent book to each tenant, and the price is deducted from the rent. Such a method is too disturbing and should be strictly prohibited. I have always admired Mayor Lu for his open-mindedness and willingness to accept good advice. Therefore, we have jointly stated the reasons and submitted a written request to your government to review and approve the repeal of the Housing Rental Rules to avoid disputes and align with public sentiment. We are extremely anxious to await your orders. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Government.</p>

<p>Willing to Come to the Association to Check Accounts Within One Week</p>
<p>The Shanghai All Circles Investigation and Rescue National Donation Committee yesterday sent personnel with a letter to the Local Association to investigate the national donation accounts of the former Local Maintenance Association. Now, the Association's reply letter has been found, which roughly states: "Yesterday, we received a letter stating that on August 16th, your committee announced that it would like our association to send all receipts for various national donation collections and expenditures handled by your association to your committee for investigation. We hope that you will consider this. Now that the deadline is approaching, we have specially sent personnel to contact everything in advance. We ask that you dispatch responsible personnel to give contact." In addition to having responded to the representative of your committee in person, we are sending Shanghai City, People's Local Maintenance Association National Donation Report and Relief Group Work Report, one copy each, for your review. After gathering the responsible personnel of the former Local Maintenance Association to discuss the results, it was publicly decided that from the 28th of this month to the 4th of next month, within one week, from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM every day, we will respectfully wait for your committee to designate responsible personnel to bring your committee's seal letter to the association to jointly check the accounts and receipts to show caution. In the letter, we also ask for the names of those who will come to the association to read the accounts to facilitate contact. As for the sending of the accounts and receipts to your committee, for the sake of careful safekeeping, everyone believes that it is difficult to send them out. We ask for your understanding. We hope that you will reply in advance, etc."</p>

<p>Recruiting Old Troops to Supplement the Volunteer Army</p>
<p>Requesting Assistance from All Parties with Military Supplies and Ammunition</p>
<p>Wang Gongjue, Commander of the Third Route of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, recently sent a telegram from the front to the Shanghai-based liaison office, stating that the troops stationed in the Fengwangkou area, following the order from Commander-in-Chief Zhu, forwarded instructions to all units to advance towards the border of Chahar day and night, and arrived at the northeast Goujiazi Xinyingzi of Rehe on the 15th. According to reconnaissance reports, the Japanese army led by Colonel Murakami Tatsuo attacked our army. Yang Xianfu's troops of the First Column of Xinyingzi bravely intercepted the enemy, and fierce fighting continued until dawn on the 17th, with dozens of hand-to-hand combats. Due to the fierce Japanese artillery fire, the sacrifices were great. The Second Column was then mobilized to outflank the enemy's rear, and with the assistance of volunteer armies from all routes, the enemy was finally repelled, and three Japanese officers were captured. The enemy also suffered heavy casualties. In recent days, local militias such as Qu Zhicheng, Zhang Mouzi, and Bu Minguang have also led troops to participate in the killing of the enemy, and the morale of the people is very high. A large-scale anti-Japanese war will soon break out in Rehe Province, and the area west of Rehe has become tense. However, the army of this route currently lacks military supplies and ammunition, and the casualties are too great. I am scheduled to leave for the Pass within days to recruit old troops in various places for prompt replenishment, and to request sufficient ammunition and a large amount of military supplies and funds from all parties to prepare for participating in the anti-Japanese war and achieve the recovery of lost territories."</p>
<h3 id="e123">Continued Report on Restrictions on Chinese Immigration to Singapore <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Singapore has the largest number of overseas Chinese, and many businesses are operated by overseas Chinese. This year, rubber and other items in the area have been affected by the global economic downturn. The number of factories reducing workers and suspending production is increasing day by day, and the number of unemployed workers in the area is increasing day by day, so there is a restriction on Chinese immigrants. This matter has been recorded in this newspaper. Now, after detailed investigation by reporters, the situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Quota Regulations: Since the end of last month, when European postal ships traveling from Shanghai to Europe carrying overseas Chinese to Singapore encountered the problem of being prohibited from landing upon arrival, the European class of wheel companies, for business reasons, reduced the sale of tickets to Singapore, while consulting the British Consul in Shanghai, whether there are any restrictions on the number of overseas Chinese going to Singapore in the future. At the same time, they wired the Singapore branch to inquire with the colonial government to avoid disputes. Telegrams went back and forth and were discussed for a long time. It is now heard that the colonial government has agreed that each postal ship from Shanghai to Singapore shall carry no more than 25 Chinese passengers. If the quota is exceeded, a fine of no more than 1,000 Singapore dollars will be imposed for each Chinese passenger.</p>
<p>Ticket Purchase Restrictions: The Singapore colonial authorities, under strict restrictions on the number of Chinese going to the Nanyang Islands, and those going to Singapore, those of property class and substantial merchants, and those who travel, because they go to Singapore, belong to the surplus of life, and are prepared to go to consumption, or are related to trade, and are also sufficient to make Sing埠 profit, there is no problem at the time of entry, and it is still convenient to purchase tickets and sign for a passport. If there are no wealthy Chinese who want to go to Nanyang to seek a living, it is very difficult at the time of entry, and it is not easy to purchase tickets and sign for a passport.</p>
<p>Strict Inspection of Private Stowaways: Often, ship personnel of cargo ships privately accept bribes and hide laborers on board at Chinese ports, or hide them in cargo holds or pose as sailors, and secretly bring them to the new ocean islands to sneak into the country. It has been discovered many times. Therefore, the colonial authorities have strictly inspected cargo ships from Chinese ports to Singapore and other ports to prevent the smuggling of Chinese into the country.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Joint Meeting of the Eight Charity Groups the Day Before Yesterday <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Association, in view of the recent heavy disasters, wants to provide relief, but its strength is weak, so on the 22nd, it invited the Red Swastika Society, the Bodhi Dharma Assembly, the Lianyishan Society, the Qiyuan Dharma Assembly, the Moral General Association, the Yishan Society, Weizhongtang, and even the Association, a total of eight charity groups, to hold a joint degree meeting. More than 20 people including Zhang Lanping, Weng Yinchu, and Huang Hanzhi attended the meeting. Xu Qianlin was publicly elected chairman. After discussion, it was decided that the group would do its best to handle disaster relief matters. However, the disaster situation is widespread in the country, and it is not easy to raise funds. It is willing to provide relief, but lacks the ability to raise funds. This is a big concern. It was decided that there are many disaster victims in Zhengyang. It is urgent to collect several thousand dollars first and entrust the Red Swastika Society to check and release emergency relief. After that, each will do its best and work together to promote good relations. It is especially hoped that charitable people on the sea will rise up upon hearing the news, uphold the virtue of heaven's love of life, have the heart of a compatriot, save on food and clothing, and provide more assistance, so that one point of financial resources can increase one point of good will. It is observed that the cold wind will rise sharply in late autumn and winter. The disaster victims who have no clothes and no food are waiting for relief. It is even more difficult to rely on relief. It is hoped that enthusiastic people will generously donate to alleviate the accumulated difficulties.</p>

<p>Houses Destroyed, People and Animals All Killed</p>
<p>What I Saw and Heard Was Extremely Tragic</p>
<p>The Chinese Children's Relief Association, in view of the large number of refugees in the North China war zone, where women and children were the most affected, the association appointed Zhao Jinqing, Li Tingan, Zhu Lide, etc. to establish a relief committee and sent representative Chen Tiesheng to the war zone to provide on-site relief. It has been nearly half a year since then. In addition to running around between Tianjin and Peking to contact local organizations and establish shelters and handle the welfare of disaster-stricken children, the representative also went to Qinhuangdao, Changli, Miyun, and various places in the Luan River to investigate the disaster situation and plan relief, which has been quite successful. The association received a telegram from representative Chen from Zunhua yesterday, reporting that he had recently visited the villages and towns in the county that were most severely affected by the war, such as Ershilipu, Santunying, Shouyidian, Luanyangcheng, Xifengkou, and Cizhao outside the Pass, a total of more than 70 places. What he saw and heard was extremely tragic. The houses were destroyed, and the people and animals were all killed. Those who were fortunate enough to escape were mostly starving to death and in need of urgent relief. Therefore, the representative will report the results of the survey to the local authorities in Peiping and enthusiastic people to raise a large amount of rice and cash to carry out relief.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Members of the Postal Affairs Associations Issue Responsible Remarks <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Regarding Post Office Layoffs</p>
<p>The postal authorities, in order to compensate for the current postal losses, have decided to forcibly retire more than 30 senior personnel across the country starting on September 1st of this year. This matter has aroused strong opposition from the postal affairs associations. According to a certain standing committee member of the postal affairs associations, he issued responsible remarks yesterday, saying: "The biggest reason for the post office's economic losses is due to the separation of the savings and remittance bureau, the subsidies for airlines, and the unrestricted transfer of funds from the Ministry of Transportation. In view of the seriousness of the situation, if this continues, the postal economy will be on the verge of bankruptcy. In the past year, we have thoroughly reviewed the reasons for the post office's economic losses, drafted a plan to consolidate the postal base, and adopted strike measures to seek implementation. The government representative and local leaders accepted the principles, and in May of this year, the Postal Economic System Research Committee drafted an implementation outline and recommended that the authorities adopt and implement it. However, to this day, the savings and remittance bureau is still separated, and the airline subsidies have reached more than 300,000 yuan in the past six months. As for the transfer of funds to the ministry, it was originally 30,000 yuan per month. After the separation of the savings and remittance bureau, it increased by 30,000 yuan per month. After the postal protection movement last year, it increased by another 30,000 yuan per month. If we think about it, how can the postal economic situation not get worse under such a situation? Under this situation, the postal authorities suddenly abandoned the fundamental and pursued the superficial, forcibly retiring a part of the personnel, and changing the pension fund subsidy from 7% of the total salary of the national employees to 5%. Upon investigation, postal employees enter the bureau after passing the examination, and their positions are guaranteed. There is no precedent for forced retirement. According to the Postal General Administration's training order No. 26768803, these members have served for a long time, are relatively old and weak, and their work is mediocre and their performance is poor. However, the ages of the laid-off personnel are all around 52 or 53, and according to regulations, they can serve until they are 60 years old. They are not old, their bodies are quite strong, their strength has not declined, and they are all important positions, and there is no failure to know. The report of the result is not mediocre, and the performance reports are excellent. The so-called bad news will be attacked. The authorities forcibly laid off personnel with unwarranted accidents, and the employees' positions have no security. The people are in a state of self-danger, and the postal efficiency will be greatly affected. In addition, the pension system is excellent and good. Postal employees are so loyal and diligent because they will have funds to support themselves after retirement and are not worried about leaving the country. Now the postal authorities have reduced the subsidy by 2%. If this is done, the pension will inevitably be shaken, people will panic, and the postal system will be disrupted. For the sake of protecting the post office, this association has always sought a thorough solution and has consulted with the ministry to seek a proper solution. The ministry has expressed that it is very calm. Unexpectedly, Huang Naishu, Director of the Postal Bureau, insisted on his own way and obstructed it. I don't know what his intention is. If he wants to destroy the postal system and cut the benefits of employees, this association will do its best to deal with it."</p>

<p>Since the Ministry of Transportation Telecommunications Machinery Manufacturing Factory was ordered to be shut down, the Ministry sent two special commissioners to Shanghai to take over and organize the machinery. However, all the technicians of the factory were worried about their livelihoods after the shutdown. Although they had petitioned the city party headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau once before, there were no significant results. Therefore, they again elected representatives Shi Longbao, Yan Yucai, and Ye Junru to petition Yan Renguang, Director of Telecommunications Administration, for resumption of work, or to give priority to employing old workers when the factory is restored in the future. On the one hand, they also sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, explaining that the factory is related to national defense transportation, and requested that it be ordered to continue operating. In addition, there was a memorial of more than 4,000 words, detailing the reasons why it should not be shut down to Minister of Transportation Zhu Jiajun. The worker dismissal fee stipulated by the ministry has not yet been issued and must be claimed when all work is completed. It is heard that the factory was reorganized from the former Ministry of Transportation Material Office on Maigen Road, and is divided into the Telegraph Machine Wireless Radio Dry Battery Department, all manufactured with domestic raw materials and supplied to domestic telecommunications bureaus and radio stations. All parts made are quite suitable.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Ministry of Transportation Implements Radio Control <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>All Radio Stations are Registered and Calibrated</p>
<p>Planning to Implement Broadcasting Inspection Recently</p>
<p>In this city, there are more commercial radio stations than government-run ones, and many of them are not controlled by the Ministry of Transportation. Even among the radio stations, they do not communicate with each other, so there are often confusions and conflicts between the sound waves of the two radio stations. In view of this, the Ministry of Transportation is implementing radio control. The first step is to make all radio stations register. The second step is for the Ministry of Transportation to calibrate the sound waves of each radio station. The third step is to review the broadcasting content of each radio station. Now, the first and second steps have been completed, but the third step is still in preparation due to cumbersome procedures. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e129">Circular on Registration <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The first step in the Ministry of Transportation's plan for this matter is to order all commercial radio stations to register in order to start work later. Now all radio stations have complied, and even radio stations in the concession have gone to register. As for foreign radio stations, after the Ministry of Communication contacted them, they fully complied and were subject to the control of the Ministry of Communication as Chinese radio stations.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Calibration of Wave Numbers <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Before registration, the broadcasting of each radio station was not very uniform, and some violated the international radio station regulations. According to international regulations, the radio station number used by our country is XG, while a small number of radio stations use XC. This number is used by Mexico, and our country cannot use it. There are also several foreign radio stations broadcasting numbers that are IUKO. This kind of game broadcasting is not applicable. Since registering with the Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry has ordered each radio station to disable this out-of-bounds number, and it has been completely banned.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Going to Inspection <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation also found that the messages sent by various radio stations often contain obscene songs and songs that obstruct public morals, giving citizens a bad impression. Radio was originally a tool for spreading culture. In this way, it is contrary to the principle. Therefore, it is planned to conduct inspections so that each radio station will submit the broadcast program to the Ministry for inspection in time before broadcasting. This will not only eliminate abuses, but also prevent the broadcasting time of each radio station from conflicting. This matter is currently being prepared, and it can probably be realized in a short period of time.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Arbitration of Labor Disputes over Wage Cuts in British-American Tobacco Factory <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency stated that the labor dispute over wage cuts in the British-American Tobacco Factory was previously guided by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Public Security Bureau. As a result, Labor No. 137 mediation records were made. The dispute over how many days of work per week after June 8th was resolved on the 5th of this month by the Social Affairs Bureau convening both labor and management to mediate. The labor representative requested that the number of days of work per week should not be less than four days in the future. The management representative agreed to work four days or more than four days per week from June 1st to July 10th. After July 10th, if it is necessary to work less than four days, the factory should first submit it to the bureau for approval, but it is only willing to be responsible for fulfilling this method and is unwilling to sign the mediation record. In addition, the labor representative requested that wages be paid as usual during the previous wage reduction period. The reason is that this has been the case in the past. The management representative believes that it was the management's generosity in the past. In the future, if you don't work, you will not be paid wages. After repeated persuasion by the chairman of the association, it failed to reconcile. The situation of the case dispute is serious and has been extended for more than a month. It was declared on the spot that the mediation was not established. The Social Affairs Bureau has now submitted a request to the Municipal Government to submit the case to arbitration in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 of the Labor Dispute Handling Law to eliminate disputes.</p>

<p>After Mr. Fei Kailai, the Chilean Representative to China and Consul General in Shanghai, took a leave of absence to return to his country, his position as Representative and Consul General was temporarily entrusted to Mr. Wang Tuo, the Chilean Representative to Japan. After Mr. Wang and his wife arrived in Shanghai a few days ago, they visited Yu Ming, Director of the Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Shanghai, on Fenglin Bridge at about 11:00 am yesterday. Yu was in Beijing on official business, so Zhao Tiezhang, section chief, received him instead. They talked for about ten minutes and then left. It is heard that Mr. Wang Tuo will, according to custom, send an official letter to the Engineering Bureau and other consulates in various countries to inform them that he is also acting as Consul General in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Shao Zhu Joint Telegram on Finance Minister Song Unifying the Special Tax Collection on Shaanxi-Gansu Native Tobacco <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reports that Shao Lizi, Chairman of Shaanxi Province, and Zhu Shaoliang, Chairman of Gansu Province, in order to revitalize the native tobacco industry in Shaanxi and Gansu, jointly telegraphed Song, the Minister of Finance, requesting approval to levy a special tax on native tobacco to benefit agriculture. The original telegram is as follows: Respected Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance, Nanjing. It has been observed that counties such as Gaolan in Gansu produce green, yellow, striped tobacco leaves, which are the only export products of Gansu. Merchants in Shaanxi have also been transporting and selling tobacco leaves here. In recent years, due to frequent disasters, the production volume has already sharply decreased. Furthermore, after the loss of the Northeast, the Niuzhuang and Dalian markets were cut off. Other regions have also been affected by the impact of imported cigarettes, and sales have been sluggish, leading to a crisis. Rural areas are declining, and markets are bleak. This is a major cause. Previously, I, Lizi, in order to support agriculture and revitalize local products, together with President Yu Youren, advocated improved production to facilitate sales. After I, Shaoliang, arrived in Gansu and examined the situation, I also felt that maintaining tobacco leaves was an essential measure to revive the local rural economy. We were just about to submit a request to the government when we learned that your ministry had implemented a special tax on native tobacco in seven provinces, including Jiangsu and Zhejiang, demonstrating your intent to protect local products and resist foreign goods. We deeply admire your grand plan. The situation in Shaanxi and Gansu is the same. Therefore, we are jointly telegraphing you to earnestly request that you consider the poverty of the Northwest and the scarcity of products, and include this type of native tobacco in the special tax zone along with the seven provinces for unified collection, so as to avoid the suffering of repeated taxation during transportation and sales. In this way, the markets and rural areas of Shaanxi and Gansu can prosper, and the national economy and the people's livelihood will benefit. We are sending this special telegram for your consideration and reply. Yours sincerely, Shao Lizi, Zhu Shaoliang, respectfully.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Cotton Cloth Association, in response to a letter from the Citizens' Association for Promoting National Products requesting strict sanctions against factories such as Gongzu, Zhou, etc., for privately importing enemy goods and reselling them with changed labels, sent a reply to the association yesterday, stating: Respectfully, we received your letter dated the 23rd of this month, stating that the Gongzu Sock Factory, Zhou Dingxin, Junchang, Tonghe Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Sanyang, Jiuyi, Yukang Cotton Weaving Factory, Yongyuan Mercerizing Factory, and Yixing Company,</p>
<p>illegally transported enemy yarn of the Dakang Yarn Factory's "Liuma" brand, changed it to the "Ren Zhong" brand of the Shenxin No. 5 Factory, and wove it into goods for sale in various ports. This not only deceives the public but also undermines the national product movement. You requested that we take strict measures to address this. Upon investigation, except for the Gongzu Sock Factory, the other factories are engaged in the silk and mercerized cotton weaving industry and are not within the scope of our association. Therefore, we have no way to handle this. However, to ensure that our members are aware and can distinguish between these products, we have already sent a notice as per your letter. We respectfully request your attention to this matter.</p>

<h3 id="e140">The Municipal Health Bureau is Constructing a Model Rural Health Area in Wusong <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Building Treatment Facilities to Facilitate Villagers' Access to Medical Care</p>
<p>Instilling Health Knowledge to Improve Farmers' Health</p>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau believes that health is of great importance to the revival of the rural economy. It is actively carrying out health facilities in the rural areas of the city. Recently, it has designated Wusong as a model rural health area in the city, allocated funds, and actively carried out construction. Although it is just beginning, it has achieved considerable results. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e141">The Motivation for Constructing a Model Area <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Before the January 28th Incident, the Municipal Health Bureau had already established a health office and a rural health model area office in Wusong. In terms of medical equipment, there were the Seaside Hospital and the Shanghai Medical College. However, due to the outbreak of the war, the hospital and school buildings were destroyed by artillery fire, causing all health administration to come to a standstill. After the ceasefire, the Health Bureau believed that the Wusong war zone had suffered severe damage and that it was necessary to actively restore various health facilities. At the same time, Tongji Medical College also requested the Municipal Government to cooperate, so that students of the Department of Public Health could practice here, and take this opportunity to penetrate into rural areas and strive for rural health movement. The Municipal Government approved this and decided that all construction expenses should be borne jointly by the Health Bureau and Tongji Medical College. The first phase of funding has been set at 40,000 yuan, and it was decided to carry out universal health education and health facilities movement in the Wusong area, and designate the area as a rural health model area, so that it can be promoted in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Health Office to be Completed <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>After the January 28th Incident, all medical treatment facilities in the Wusong area were destroyed by artillery fire. Hundreds of thousands of farmers in Wusong felt the pain of having nowhere to seek medical treatment when they were sick. The Municipal Health Bureau, in view of this, once set up a mobile clinic car to travel to various villages and places where residents gather at any time, to facilitate medical treatment. However, due to the large number of people seeking medical treatment, it was difficult to cope with the situation. It was felt that it was necessary to establish a large-scale treatment center. The Health Bureau and Tongji Medical College jointly raised funds to build the Wusong Health District Office at the old site of the Seaside Hospital. The foundation stone was laid on July 1st, and it will be fully completed in the middle of next month. The interior will be equipped with various departments such as treatment. Before the official site is completed, a part of the Tongji Medical College's campus will be temporarily borrowed for office use, and public health expert Li Xuanguo will be hired as the director of the office, and technician Li Yuren, dispatched by the Health Bureau, will be the deputy director. The office will be the center, and the construction and publicity of rural health education will be gradually implemented. Although the work of the office is in its initial stage, it has achieved considerable results. In July, the number of people treated has been nearly a thousand. During the summer, significant achievements have also been made in various epidemic prevention works.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Implementing Rural Health Education <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Revitalizing the countryside is the most important domestic policy measure in our country at present, and the revival of the rural economy is extremely important to the health problems of farmers. Without healthy farmers, everything in the countryside will not progress. The main purpose of the Health Bureau in constructing the Wusong Rural Health Model Area, in addition to diagnosing and treating diseases for farmers, its greatest task is to guide farmers to pay attention to health construction, and to take health education and improve farmers' health knowledge as the ultimate goal. It is heard that the initial implementation method will be carried out in three points: (1) Implement home visits for treatment, specially dispatching nurses and medical students to the homes of farmers with diseases to diagnose and treat them, and at any time convey health knowledge. (2) When patients come to the office for treatment, take the opportunity to provide instructions on health education and make them believe in the guiding agency. (3) Publicize openly, printing health propaganda materials, giving public health lectures, holding rural health movements, etc. In addition, carry out physical examinations, teach scientific methods, and eliminate pests, so that farmers in the area will become healthier day by day.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Guiding Factory Hygiene in the Area <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>There are many factories in the Wusong area. In addition to working hard in the countryside and schools, the office also pays attention to the hygiene equipment in the factories. Factory hygiene is more important than general hygiene. It is heard that the office is currently preparing everything and will start next month to conduct a thorough investigation of the hygiene conditions of each factory in the area, and send personnel to each factory at any time to provide guidance. If there are any improprieties, they will be corrected at any time to avoid various dangers and improve the health of workers.</p>

<p>The Sand Casting Department has not yet resumed work</p>
<p>Dabai News Agency reports that workers at the Wusong Machinery Factory of the Two-Way Administration often have disputes over the work of the sand casting department. They have repeatedly requested the abolition of the contracting system. The union submitted a request to the Road Bureau for review in March of this year, but has not received a reply to date. At the beginning of August, the work of the sand casting department became light, and it was planned to implement a work reduction system to reduce the burden on the contractor, which aroused the attention of all the factory workers. Therefore, the association convened a joint meeting of group leaders and put forward a discussion. All agreed that if the contractor is not abolished one day, there will be a tendency to affect the entire factory in the future. Therefore, it was resolved to request the abolition of the contracting system within ten days, otherwise, all the workers in the factory would assist the workers in the department to make a corresponding response. The Wusong factory director and contractor Shan Rongsheng were notified immediately, and the trade union council was asked to forward the matter to the Road Bureau to abolish the system within a time limit. However, before ten days had passed and the turmoil in the sand casting department had not been resolved, the Road Bureau contracted the construction of dining cars and sleeper cars for the Pinghu through train to the carpenter department contractor Han Zepei. All the factory workers learned about this. The Road Bureau intends to restore the contracting system, and it is unknown what the intention is. The turmoil in the sand casting department has not yet been resolved, and now it is planned to try the contracting system in the carpenter department. The public was indignant and implemented a work stoppage on Monday morning (21st), and there were verbal conflicts and fights with each other. The union received the news and sent personnel to stop it, but two workers had been injured. In the afternoon of that day, the executive council of the union, fearing that the situation would escalate, specially sent the executive director Chen Bohua to investigate and stop it. However, the Road Bureau did not send personnel to the scene that day, so there was no result and the meeting was adjourned. The following morning (Tuesday), the work stoppage continued. At about 3 p.m., the bureau finally sent Yuan Boyang, together with party committee member Chen Chengshi, to persuade and accept the demands of the workers. The workers were satisfied and dispersed. The contracting system of the carpentry department has been abolished, so the workers have resumed work as usual. The Road Bureau has accepted the principle of abolishing the contracting system in the sand casting department, but it must wait for the workers in the department to state the reasons before reviewing it. Therefore, the work in the department has not yet resumed. Regarding this point, on the morning of the 23rd, more than 20 worker representatives, led by Party Committee member Chen Chengshi, contacted the Bureau, and then Chen Chengshi and important members of the factory's workers drafted a plan and then submitted it to the Road Bureau for adoption. However, since the work stoppage at the factory, the losses have been great, reaching 5,000 yuan per day. If it is not resolved quickly, the losses will be very large.</p>

<p>The Municipal Authorities are Still Considering It</p>
<p>The transportation in the Shanghai-South district of this city, in addition to the trams running on various lines, used to have the Shanghai-South Public Bus service. However, since the January 28th Incident, the Shanghai-South Public Bus Company suffered excessive losses and could not maintain its operations, so it declared bankruptcy. However, the market has now recovered to its former state, and Li Xiaocang and others have petitioned the Municipal Public Works Bureau to undertake the operation of public buses. However, for the sake of prudence, they will first open two lines from Ximen to Longhua and Yuancheng Yuan Road, with a capital of 200,000 yuan and 100,000 yuan actually paid up, and will order 14 new German-style Benz diesel buses. If the business improves, they will seek to expand. However, according to another news, the municipal government may take over the operation of public buses in Shanghai-South. Whether this statement can be realized still needs to be considered by all parties.</p>

<p>Four Witnesses Summoned Yesterday for Detailed Questioning</p>
<p>At the End, the Portuguese Consul Suddenly Prohibited Public Attendance</p>
<p>丨The Final Hearing Will Be Held Today丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Portuguese Consulate summoned witnesses again in the box corpse case and opened the third hearing. At first, it was still open to the public, but later the presiding judge prohibited public attendance. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e148">Summoning Witnesses <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The third preliminary hearing opened at 10 AM yesterday. The Portuguese Consul, Xiang Erfo, first brought the two main suspects, Padraile Ramidio and Zhou Shifu Ramidio, from the Xiamen Road Western Prison to the consulate for the third interrogation. Regarding the investigation of criminal evidence, there had been some progress after two hearings. Yesterday's third interrogation involved summoning four people to the case: Pi Dilai, a member of the Hongkou Fire Brigade, a dock worker named Zhang from the Huishan Wharf, Zhang He, the female landlord of No. 15 Jiaxing Road, and her son, Zhang Jingui. They were ordered to truthfully provide information to prove that the two main offenders committed the murder and moved the body.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Stating the Facts of the Case <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>When the Portuguese Consul General opened the court, he first asked the Portuguese Pidelai, who was a member of the fire brigade. Pi lived at No. 22 Jiaxing Road, which was opposite No. 15, where the murder took place. Pi Dilai testified that a Westerner first rented No. 15, and later he saw the Westerner arguing with a Chinese woman and hitting her. The Portuguese Consul immediately ordered Pi to identify the two defendants. Pi Dilai pointed out that Padraile was the person who committed the assault. The Portuguese Consul then asked if he had witnessed the assault. Pi said he did.</p>

<p>The Portuguese Consul then summoned the dock worker No. 7 from the Huishan Wharf to ask who delivered the iron box containing the corpse to the dock on August 5th, a Westerner or a Chinese person. The worker testified that it was a young man in Western clothes who delivered it, but he did not pay attention to their origin or appearance at the time, so he had forgotten. However, when the Portuguese Consul ordered him to identify the two defendants, the worker replied that it was difficult to identify them, but the box was definitely the correct one.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Portuguese Consul questioned the landlord Zhang He. Was the renter a foreigner? What was their name? Zhang He replied that it was a Westerner, but she did not know their name. While speaking, she pointed to Padraile and said that he was the one who rented the house. The Portuguese Consul asked if she knew his brother. She replied that she did not recognize him. He then asked who carried the iron box to the upstairs room. Zhang He said that two people carried it to the upstairs room at the same time. He then questioned her son, Zhang Jingui, who said that he had seen the landlord hitting a woman. At this point, the Portuguese Consul re-examined Pidelai's statement that the defendant's house was diagonally opposite his, and that the Chinese woman was indeed assaulted by Padraile Ramidio.</p>

<p>Police Investigation Not Yet Completed</p>
<p>Rescheduled for Re-Examination on the 31st</p>
<p>丨Gao's Request for Bail Denied丨</p>
<p>Gao Lansheng, also known as Gao A'gen, also known as Ma Pi A'gen, a 32-year-old Hangzhou native from No. 4 Sande Alley, Sapo Sai Road, French Concession, previously opened a large flower gambling den in the French Concession and privately manufactured red pills and sold morphine. The police found out and went to arrest him. He fled upon hearing the news. The Second Special District Court issued a warrant for his arrest. The other day, the criminal police learned that Gao was hiding in the Cangzhou Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road. The Chief Western Detective Rao Boze led a team of Western detectives and, together with the Jing'an Temple police, rushed to the scene and arrested Gao and his accomplice, Sun Qihai (30 years old, from Chuansha), together. The details have been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, the police escorted Gao and Sun to the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. Judge Zhang Chaozuo interrogated them. First, the police lawyer Yao Zhao stated the facts of the case, saying that the first defendant, Gao Lansheng, was wanted by your court for the crimes of murder, flower gambling, and selling opium substitutes. Gao fled the Cangzhou Hotel to evade punishment and was now arrested by the police. The second defendant, Sun Qihai, was arrested in the same location and is also suspected of selling drugs. The police requested a one-week postponement to complete the investigation and file a lawsuit. The judge briefly questioned the two defendants. The lawyers hired by the defendants, Wang Shizong, Jiang Yiping, Zhu Dianqing, Wu Linkun, and Jiang Baoli, requested that the defendants be released on bail pending trial.</p>
<p>The court considered the case to be serious and denied bail. The case was adjourned to the 31st for re-examination. The defendants were detained.</p>
<h3 id="e155">A Large Batch of Gold Bars Confiscated on the Haiyan Steamer <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Since the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company sent police to inspect the Haiyun Steamer, a Wenzhou-bound vessel, a large number of illegally carried gold bars were found. The general situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>According to regulations, gold and silver ingots must be declared and taxed when brought into or out of the country. Entrusting a steamer to transport them and listing them on the manifest is in accordance with the procedures. However, a certain jewelry store in this port, recently in need of gold from Wenzhou colleagues, specially sent an employee with a large batch of gold to Wenzhou to distribute it to various colleagues' jewelry stores. At that time, they were greedy for small profits and did not declare it, nor did they hand it over to the shipping bureau. Instead, the employee carried it with them, boarded the steamer to Wenzhou, hoping to get through.</p>
<p>In order to prevent pirates from mixing in, the shipping companies have been sending police to inspect each departing steamer, which is very strict. The China Merchants Bureau specially sent eight Russian police officers, together with the wharf patrolmen, to inspect each steamer before departure, one hour before departure after all passengers had arrived. When the Haiyan Steamer was about to depart from Shanghai, the Russian police patrolmen also entered the cabin to search. In the official cabin, a large amount of gold was found. When the gold bars were confiscated, it was late at night, just before the Haiyan was about to depart. The Russian police patrolmen searched the official cabin and found a passenger's luggage with glittering gold, as many as thirty-four bars. The total weight, calculated at ten taels per bar, was also more than three hundred taels. Calculated at the market price, the value was tens of thousands of dollars. At that time, the inspectors, because they were privately carrying the gold in violation of the ban, immediately reported to the South Wharf to ask for instructions.</p>
<p>The South Wharf manager received the inspector's report and ordered the confiscated gold bars to be secretly sent to the South Wharf manager's office, and the person carrying the gold was also taken there. It was late at night, and there were not many people there. The witnesses were also taken to the manager's office. After repeated questioning by the manager, the passenger initially refused to tell the truth, only saying that they often went to Wenzhou to make jewelry for jewelry stores and were not privately transporting it. The gold bars were temporarily stored, and the name of the Shanghai jewelry store was asked. The South Wharf paid the way to inquire and confirmed the information, and then imposed a fine according to the regulations for illegally transporting goods. The confiscated gold bars were all returned. As for the amount of the fine, the parties kept it a secret, so it was impossible to know. The customs authorities have also received this news and have sent people to investigate the truth of the case.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Package of Lead Bars Passed Off as Fifty Dollars <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Luckily the Shop Assistant Was Experienced, Otherwise, They Would Have Been Greatly Deceived</p>
<p>At precisely 3:45 PM the day before yesterday, two men, Huang Yu from Hubei and Wang Huanlian from Jiangxi, arrived together at the Yong Heng Gold Shop located at No. 210 Nanjing Road. They selected a gold bar and paid a deposit for it, weighing three taels and five mace, equivalent to 371 yuan at market price. Huang and Wang then took out 330 paper yuan and a package of cash, totaling 50 yuan, from their person. After the shop assistant, Fu Yulin, inspected it and found it correct, he turned to go upstairs to stamp the gold bar. Unexpectedly, Huang and Wang harbored ill intentions and took advantage of this time to replace the 50 yuan in cash with lead bars, shaping and wrapping them to resemble 50 yuan, hoping to deceive. However, when Fu came downstairs, he needed to return nine yuan in change, so he wanted to unwrap the package to take out the money. Huang and Wang, seeing that things were going wrong, hurriedly claimed to Fu that it was not necessary to make change at this time. The remaining nine yuan could be temporarily kept in the shop because they still needed to take the gold bar back home for his concubine to inspect. If she deemed it acceptable, they would return later. However, Fu refused and insisted on unwrapping the package to make the change. Seeing their plan foiled and in desperation, Huang and Wang had no choice but to turn and flee. Fu immediately blew the alarm whistle, and Chinese Constable No. 2835 and Chinese Detective Huang Yongji arrived, apprehending Huang Yuyi and Wang Huanlian. Together with the lead bars, paper money, and gold bar, they were taken to the Central Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer, Zhang Shizhu, presented the case, stating that the police are now prosecuting them for attempted fraud under Article 363 of the Criminal Law. However, the case still needs to be investigated, so he requested a postponement. Fu Yulin, the shop assistant from Yong Feng Heng Gold Shop, also testified to everything. When questioned, the two defendants gave evasive answers. After the judge reviewed the statements, he ordered the two defendants to be remanded in custody, pending a further hearing in seven days after investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Rascals Impersonating Detectives Extort Money Under the Pretense of Inspecting for Opium <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Countless Smokers Suffer</p>
<p>Even a Monk at the Guandi Temple Was Extorted</p>
<p>In the spring of this year, unscrupulous individuals impersonating police detectives broke into residents' homes. Under the pretext of searching for drugs, they would extort large sums of money if they discovered opium paraphernalia. Those who possessed such items knew they were violating the law, so they dared not speak out even when exploited. When the police authorities learned of this, they ordered a thorough investigation. Two men, Tang Yonggui and Zhang Shunchang, were apprehended and handed over to the First Special District Court for legal punishment. This practice subsided somewhat. However, over time, Tang's accomplices have resumed their activities, again impersonating police officers, claiming to be searching for opium, and extorting money everywhere. Many have suffered. Recently, Chinese Detective Song Bingzheng and Detective Chen Yaoting apprehended three men: Wang Jinyu from Tianjin, Tang Yilong from Jiangbei, and Zhuang Arong from Pudong. According to the detectives' investigation, the following people had been defrauded of money: Xu Jianquan of 563 Park Road lost 20 yuan, Du Caifeng of 14 Xin Zha Road lost 50 yuan, Mrs. Ma of 129 Park Road lost 80 yuan, Mrs. Wang Li of 187 Park Road lost 10 yuan, Qian [blank]liang of 8 Xinping Lane, Longmen Road lost 50 yuan, Wang Yuzhang of 93 Fujian Road lost 75 yuan, Jing Shiyuan of 954 Broadway Road lost 200 yuan, Fei Lianshi and Xu Yangchu of 276 Shandong Road lost 300 yuan, Zhang [blank]shi of 64 Shandong Road lost 50 yuan, Ding [blank]yan of 7, Lane 140 Xin Zha Road lost 141 yuan, Mrs. Zhang Qian of 44, Lane 66 Xin Zha Road lost 30 yuan, and Wang Haisheng of 90 Longmen Road lost 120 yuan. In addition, the monk Xi Jing inside the Guandi Temple on Danshui Road was also extorted by Wang Jinyu and his gang, suffering incalculable losses. Yesterday, the police brought the three suspects, Wang, Tang, and Zhuang, along with the victims, to the First Special District Court. Judge Liu Yugui opened the court for interrogation. The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated that the defendants habitually impersonated detectives. If they learned that someone possessed contraband, they would forcibly search the premises and extort money. The residents suffered greatly. Now that they have been apprehended, he requested that they be severely punished according to the law. The court then questioned the victims about the circumstances of the defendants' impersonation and extortion. Afterwards, the court questioned the defendants individually and ordered them to be remanded in custody for further investigation.</p>

<p>His Wild Nature Doesn't Change and Always Causes Trouble</p>
<p>The Guest Monk Is Beaten and Seriously Injured</p>
<p>A stonemason named Liang Maotai recently had his fifteen-year-old son, Xiao Nan, work at the Fancang Temple on Route Galle, No. 271, in the French Concession. The day before yesterday afternoon, Xiao Nan was drying a short shirt in the courtyard when Changming, the temple's incense-lighting monk (who manages the kitchen, cleaning, and miscellaneous tasks), saw him. Without asking why, Changming slapped Xiao Nan twice. Later, Xiao Nan complained to his father, Liang Maotai, who went to Changming to reason with him. Not only did Changming refuse to listen, but he also struck Liang in the back with a brick and pushed him down the stairs, causing severe injuries. When the abbot, Hui Kai, learned of this, he questioned Changming, who remained unruly and spoke disrespectfully. Abbot Hui Kai and the guest master decided to let the matter drop in the interest of peace and order, and simply ordered Changming to leave the temple immediately to prevent further incidents. However, less than two hours after leaving the temple, Changming returned with more than ten thugs, making a great commotion, seeking the abbot for revenge. Unable to find the abbot, they grabbed the guest monk (who manages the temple's accounts and affairs) and beat him violently, causing his nose to bleed profusely. At that moment, Chinese Detective Zhou Ruzhang and Western Constable No. 322 from the French Police happened to pass by and heard the commotion. They entered the temple and apprehended Changming, while the rest of the gang scattered and fled. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. The police lawyer, Fei Xizhen, presented the case, prosecuting him for assault under Article 293 of the Criminal Law. Abbot Hui Kai of the Fancang Temple testified about the previous incident, stating that the defendant had a fierce nature and often caused trouble, violating not only the national laws but also the temple rules. It was discovered that the defendant had been convicted of theft in 1927 and handled by the British Concession Court. Therefore, he was familiar with criminals. After being released from prison, he shaved his head and became a monk at the temple. Unexpectedly, he did not change his wild nature and resorted to violence at every turn, which was extremely illegal. He requested that he be severely punished according to the law. The witness, Monk Huaxing, and Liang Maotai and his son testified about the defendant's assault. When questioned, Changming gave evasive answers. After Judge Qiu Huan [blank] reviewed the statements, he ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody for further questioning.</p>

<p>The National Products Movement Exhibition in this city has seen enthusiastic participation from factories since registration began the day before yesterday. The planned 150 booths have been expanded to 200, but still fall short of demand. The venue fee was originally set at 20 yuan per booth. However, after detailed review in recent days, the total expenditure is estimated to be 6,000 yuan in national currency. The revenue from the venue fees, calculated at 200 booths, is only 4,000 yuan, a shortfall of 2,000 yuan. The association specially convened a preparatory committee meeting the day before yesterday afternoon to discuss this matter. It was resolved to increase the fee by five yuan per booth, bringing the total fee to 25 yuan per booth. It is reported that the association has already notified all participating factories to pay the additional venue fee. The notice stated: "Regarding the venue fee, it was originally set at 20 yuan per booth. However, due to the significant shortfall between revenue and expenditure, it was resolved at the first preparatory meeting to add five yuan per booth, bringing the total to 25 yuan. Accordingly, we issue this notice, requesting your esteemed factory to bring the funds along with the receipt to the association to exchange for a new receipt as soon as possible."</p>

<p>He Committed 48 Kidnapping Cases</p>
<p>More Than 30 Hostages Were Ransomed</p>
<p>Since the notorious bandit Tai Bao Ashu was arrested and executed, his gang of several thousand members mostly split into groups and scattered, each engaging in robbery, kidnapping, and extortion. As a result, the areas bordering Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces suffered greatly. Therefore, the Suzhou-Songjiang Water Bandit Suppression Headquarters spared no effort to track down the gang to bring peace to the people. Some time ago, they learned that members of the gang had committed crimes in Suzhou and fled to Shanghai. Therefore, they specially dispatched Xu Fengshan, the head of the investigation team, to Shanghai to work with Chinese and Western detectives from the French Concession Police. They arrested four bandits on Route Lafayette: Xue Xiaomingzi, Gao Guiyou, Huang Cailin, all from Yancheng, and Zhang Yaofei from Pudong. After interrogation, the four confessed without reservation. The headquarters submitted their statements to the provincial government, which approved the death sentences for Gao and others. At that time, Huang confessed that the leader of the kidnappers, Xue San from Yancheng (the younger brother of the arrested Xue Xiaomingzi), was hiding. He also revealed that Xue San had committed as many as 48 kidnapping cases, using a small boat that he repaired at Zheng San's shipyard in Yangjing Town, Pudong, specifically to hide hostages. More than 30 hostages had been ransomed from that boat. After reviewing the confession, the headquarters immediately dispatched Xu Fengshan to investigate Xue's hiding place. He specially came to Shanghai with a letter to request assistance from the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's Investigation Team. Gao Wansheng, Zhao Jinshan, Bao Ziying, Zhao Pire, Jiang Jinxiang, and other detectives from the team, along with several police officers from the Third District, Second Precinct of Pudong, went to the shipyard in Yangjing Town at around 6:00 AM yesterday morning and arrested the kidnapping ringleader Xue San (36 years old) and his wife, Xue Wangshi (28 years old). They were brought back to the team along with the suspects. After obtaining approval from Director Wen, the two suspects were handed over to the personnel from the headquarters to be escorted back for legal proceedings. It is reported that they were escorted to Suzhou on the 11:30 AM express train yesterday.</p>

<p>Municipal Government Sends Personnel for Inspection</p>
<p>The Rihui Port and Pu Zhao River had been silted up for years, greatly hindering transportation in the Nanshi area. The Public Works Bureau previously solicited bids for the project, which was undertaken by Xin Yunji. Since the start of construction several months ago, the most difficult part of the work was the area from Damu Bridge to Tian [blank] Bridge. This was because the area along the river was in the French Concession, with too many earthenware pipes which repeatedly obstructed the work. Now, after extensive repairs, the silting has been cleared. It is reported that the Public Works Bureau specially sent Directors Dai and Lin to supervise the project diligently. The project was completed yesterday. The contractor has submitted a request to the Municipal Government and the Economic Committee to send personnel for acceptance inspection. It is reported that the Municipal Government has scheduled personnel for inspection today.</p>

<p>Before January 28th, the bureau had a police training school on Gongxing Road in Zhabei. However, it was shut down due to financial reasons. Recently, the bureau, recognizing the importance of training police officers, drafted a plan to re-establish the police training school and submitted it to the municipal government. After the municipal government approved it, the bureau assigned Commissioner Li Guangzeng and others to organize a committee. Various plans are now underway. However, part of the original site was destroyed by gunfire, and the remaining part is being used by the security team. Therefore, another solution is needed. The committee has located the old site of the Arsenal Factory. The premises are spacious with a large open area, making it very suitable for training police officers. They have submitted a request to the municipal government to forward to the Ministry of Military Affairs to borrow the site.</p>

<p>Because the existing premises are insufficient, the bureau plans to move to the old Shanghai County Office, while the existing site will be sold at auction. The proceeds, estimated at over 100,000 yuan, will be allocated to repair the various district offices. Recently, the original site of the Fifth District Police Bureau in Zhabei was completely destroyed by gunfire. Although they are currently using rented premises, it is not suitable, and the rent is expensive. There is a public land east of the Zhabei Oriental Library, where the Jisheng Hospital was originally located. However, the hospital was also destroyed in the January 28th Incident. Therefore, the district plans to allocate this land to build a new district office. The plan has been submitted to the municipal government for approval.</p>

Passengers wishing to visit the beach or swim in the sea had to transfer to a small car or rickshaw, which was time-consuming and the roads were rough, causing inconvenience. Recognizing this, the Municipal Public Works Bureau, after consultation with the Public Works Bureau, opened the Gaoqiao-Beach Road, running directly from Gaoqiao Town to the beach. The entire road has been completed. From August 27th, the public bus will run directly from Gaoqiao Pier to the beach in less than 20 minutes.

<p>Yesterday was the third day of the National YWCA Triennial Convention. The night before, Mr. Wan Shuyong reported on the recent situation of the Christian student movement, and labor representatives performed the play "Where to Go?". The plot depicted urban unemployment, rural collapse, and workers and peasants with no way out. The performance was realistic and lifelike, gaining much sympathy from the audience. Yesterday morning, group meetings were held, and the question "What are the YWCA's views and work on solving livelihood problems?" was discussed. In the afternoon, rural representatives held a tea party. In the evening, Mr. Wu Yaozong gave a lecture on "Religion and Social Reform."

<p>The houses on the upper and lower banks of North Fujian Road, from the Old Zhabei Bridge to Tangjia Lane, are all leased by the Lao Gong Mao Foreign Firm. Recently, citing increased tap water and land taxes, they notified all residents that rents would be increased by 50% starting from July. The residents, due to the area being naturally quiet and the market extremely depressed after January 28th, which has not yet recovered, are finding it difficult to maintain the status quo. Economically, they cannot afford to bear the increased rent burden. They jointly requested assistance from the North Fujian Road Business Association, which has repeatedly contacted Lao Gong Mao but without result. Therefore, a majority of residents requested a meeting to discuss countermeasures. A meeting was convened for all residents of the road at 2:00 PM yesterday (August 24th) to discuss the measures. 92 representatives attended, and He Xiangsheng, Liu Xuemei, and Yuan Bingqi were elected as the presidium. First, the chair reported on the process. Then, the residents expressed their opinions. In general, they were all unwilling to increase the rent, and some even pointed out that in other more prosperous areas, there were examples of requesting rent reductions, and they also wanted to express their desire for rent reductions. The atmosphere was very tense. Finally, countermeasures were agreed upon as follows: (1) The market is depressed and difficult to maintain. A reluctant increase of 5% to maintain the relationship between the landlord and the residents. (2) Each resident should first prepare funds to oppose the rent increase and deposit them in the bank. (3) He Xiangsheng, Bao Jiebei, and Chen Baode were elected as members of the residents' reserve fund management committee. (4) Organize the North Fujian Road Residents' Anti-Rent Increase Committee. (5) The reserve fund will be collected immediately after the procedures are completed.</p>

Recognizing that many young men and women lack sexual knowledge and suffer from venereal diseases, and that many are reluctant to seek medical treatment, unaware of how to recuperate, resulting in worry and frustration, ruining their lives, and even causing marital discord, indirectly affecting the country and society, he has based on his years of clinical experience to write a book on venereology. The book describes all kinds of male and female sexual diseases, detailing their causes, pathology, symptoms, as well as methods of maintenance and treatment. It is very detailed. Many sex books have been published in recent years, but most focus on venereal diseases and neglect true sexual diseases. The book is divided into two parts: the first part is male diseases, and the second part is female diseases. It opens the mysterious door of love from ancient times to the present, filling the gaps in medical books. Dr. [blank]'s is a unique work. The book has been published and sells for one yuan. Purchasers are very enthusiastic. Dr. Xia Shenchu's clinic at 106 Xiafei Road and the Minzhi Bookstore, among others, sell the book.</p>

<h3 id="e173">Seeking Capitalist Cooperation <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese typewriter, patented by the Ministry of Industry of the National Government, has been successfully developed and marketed since 1930 by Mr. Yu Binqi, a mechanical engineering technician who returned from studying in Japan. Certain foreign products have disappeared from the market, and the machine has been improved repeatedly. All raw materials are entirely domestically produced. The machine is sensitive, the characters are steel, strong and durable, and will not be damaged for ten years. Hundreds of units have been purchased by government agencies at all levels, banks, companies, commercial firms, and foreign firms across the country, and all have praised it. Because the inventor lacks capital, the supply cannot meet demand, and there is no formal factory, resulting in high costs, hindering the popularization of culture, which is a great regret. Moreover, there is an order from the National Government that all agencies should pay attention to the Chinese language in the future, and business will certainly develop more. It is definitely not a small-scale operation that one person can control the progress of culture. He is now willing to cooperate with Chinese nationals who can raise 10,000 to 20,000 yuan in capital, or sell the invention rights. However, it is limited to Chinese nationals. Those who are interested in this business can write to Mr. Ma Chonggan of this newspaper, who will arrange a face-to-face meeting to discuss everything.</p>

With her parents deceased, her marriage is arranged by her elder brother and sister-in-law. Her brother intends to marry Lin to a northerner, but Lin objects and plans to find a suitable match in the south. On the second day of this lunar month, it was Liangcheng's birthday, and all his sisters came to wish him a happy birthday. During the dinner, they discussed Lin's marriage, causing an argument between the siblings. Lin, thinking of her deceased parents and denial of freedom of marriage, contemplated suicide. On the evening of the 23rd, she secretly swallowed raw opium. At midnight, her sister-in-law discovered her and tried to save her by giving her soapy water, but it was ineffective. She was taken to Paulun Hospital by car at 3:00 AM yesterday morning, but the treatment was ineffective. She died at 6:00 AM. The hospital reported to the Xinzha Police Station, which informed the French Police, who sent detectives to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home to examine the body. They also investigated the circumstances of the suicide. At noon that day, they reported to the Second Special District Court. The local prosecutor went to the site and determined that the deceased, Hong Lin, had committed suicide by taking poison. The official ordered her brother, Hong Liangcheng, to prepare a coffin for burial.</p>

<p>Yesterday at around 11:00 AM, a conflict occurred between the owner of the Yiqingyong Wine Shop, Shu Yuanhe, at No. 76 [blank] Lu, Nanyang Bridge, French Concession, and armed police. The police used force, and a Chinese constable from the French Police was injured while trying to stop them. As a result, the shop owner, Shu Yuanhe, was arrested by the police. Afterwards, the police were notified, and the Wine Merchants Association investigated and negotiated. The investigated details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e179">Strict Inspection of Tax Evasion <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, Shu Yuanhe, the owner of Yiqingyong at No. 76 [blank] Lu, Nanyang Bridge, and an old clerk were transporting over ten loads of wine when they were inspected by patrol police from the Second District in the Chinese Concession. The police believed they were evading stamp tax and took Shu and the wine to the district office. Shu stated that the wine tax had been changed to the Tobacco and Alcohol Special Tax and the Domestic Wine Fixed Tax on July 1st, and stamp tax had long been abolished. He also had a letter from the Wine Merchants Association to prove it. At around 10:00 AM, he was released.</p>

<p>At around 11 o'clock, two armed police officers and three or four plainclothes officers went to the shop to demand one yuan in overdue liquor charges. The shop owner, Shu Yuanhe, pleaded with them, saying that they didn't need to repay the one yuan debt and only needed to refrain from detaining tax-bearing alcohol. A conflict arose from their verbal exchange, leading to the use of force and a brawl. The liquor jars and vats were destroyed. Upon seeing this, the shop assistants blew a whistle, and French constables arrived to stop them, but to no avail. The police officers drew their bayonets and stabbed Yuanhe fiercely. Two Chinese constables also suffered cuts on the back of their hands. As a result, the shop owner was arrested and taken to the Second District Headquarters.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Lost Collar Tab <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>The two Chinese constables failed to stop them and returned to the police station to report. The head constable immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to the scene. The police officers had already left, but a police collar tab with the number 1154 was found on the ground, along with two broken liquor jars and seven vats. The ground was covered in spilled liquor. The shop owner's son, Changjin, immediately asked a photographer, Mr. Liu, to take photos as evidence for future negotiations. He also went to the French police station to report all the details of the incident.</p>

<p>Jinhua Dispatch: The newly built Jinhua River Railway Bridge on the Jinyu section of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway, located approximately eight li west of Jinhua County, spans the Jinhua River. The bridge consists of twelve arches and is over 900 feet long. The bridge piers are constructed of reinforced concrete, and the bridge beams and deck are made of steel, with a total weight of approximately 7,500 tons. The steel plate bridge deck project was contracted to the Shanghai Yangzi Construction Company. The materials were ordered from a renowned German factory. It is said that the materials were delayed by a month after leaving the German factory and faced logistical challenges in transporting them from the Shanghai factory to the construction site, resulting in a slight delay in the commencement of work. Fortunately, the company accelerated the construction, and the project was completed on the 22nd of this month. The installation of the bridge beams, from the initial placement to the complete completion, took only two months, and the erection of the third to tenth arches was completed in just one month. The speed and efficiency with which this challenging project was completed in such a short period are truly admirable.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Rickshaw Guild Hosts Banquet for the Press Yesterday <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Reporting on the Inspection of Vehicles by the Concession Authorities</p>
<p>Gu Songmao, Zhu Heqing, and others from the Shanghai Rickshaw Guild hosted a banquet for newspaper reporters at Xinghua Lou last night at 7 p.m. to report on the inspection of vehicles by the concession authorities. According to them, the rickshaws operating in Shanghai, particularly those in the Public Concession, have always been the best. Since the January 28th Incident, vehicles have been unable to be inspected, resulting in a small number of unclean vehicles operating. The Public Concession authorities have rigorously rectified this, instructing vehicle owners to have their vehicles inspected monthly. However, since May, the industry has effectively cleaned and improved vehicles. They have been approved by the Public Works Department to employ inspectors for regular inspections and guidance. This will encourage rickshaw pullers to maintain their vehicles and keep them clean, avoiding the need for monthly inspections. The Public Works Department has agreed to withdraw the monthly inspection order. As for the former owner of the Flying Yesterday Company, due to their disinclination to operate the business in 1928, they sold all vehicles, factory buildings, etc., to Gu Jun Songmao and others. This was a complete sale, without any gifts or bequests to others. The newspaper report was a misunderstanding.</p>

<p>Publishing a Commemorative Album</p>
<p>The Nanjing Global News Agency, founded a year ago by Li Gongpu and Jin Keqian, is dedicated to translating and compiling opinions from abroad and domestic sources, issuing domestic news dispatches, and translating domestic political and economic news into English, French, and other languages for distribution to foreign opinion outlets and cultural, peace, and religious organizations. This is done to prevent friendly nations from being misled by counter-propaganda and to enhance their understanding of China. However, at the beginning, there was a severe lack of funds and talent, so most of the work had not yet begun. Only domestic news dispatches were issued from Nanjing for use by various newspapers. Since the release of the dispatches, the news has been swift and the records detailed, which has been highly praised by the press in Jiangsu, Shandong, Hebei, Henan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces. Now that the first anniversary is approaching, the agency's operations, after much difficult management, have established a considerable foundation, and it has been decided to greatly expand its operations and establish a Shanghai branch, implementing the original plan to achieve the initial goals. This plan will soon be realized. The agency has also recently compiled and published a first-anniversary commemorative album, which was released last week. The content is entirely focused on the Northeast problem, with extremely rich materials, including Qi Qifang's "The Survival of the Northeast and the Survival of China," Wang Konghang's "Anti-Japanese Literature of the People of the Northeast," He Qingming's "Observations on Inspecting Disaster Areas and Battlefields in the Past Two Years," Dong Wei's "The History of the Three Northeastern Provinces and Plans for Future Recovery," Zhao Ximeng's "Revisiting the National Crisis," and other works by Chen Lifu, Chu Minyi, Zhu Shikang, and Tang Qiyu, all of which are carefully crafted masterpieces. There are also recent situations in various parts of Rehe and various photos of northwestern customs, which have not been published elsewhere and are extremely valuable. In addition, there are recent photos and inscriptions of various anti-Japanese generals and celebrities, with a total of fifty or sixty illustrations. If people from all walks of life need this publication, they can attach a five-cent stamp and send it directly to the agency at 162 Huaihai Road, Nanjing, to purchase it.</p>

<p>Amazing Effect Insecticide King Invents Everyone knows the harm of bedbugs. There have long been various inventions and sales of potions on the market. Why do we have to compete again? However, the effect of the test is only to anesthetize. Once the medicinal properties are over, it can be resurrected. By advertising and calling, it is intended to profit from people. Bedbugs and others still do not disappear, wasting time and money. Now, China Insecticide Company, No. 9 Hankou Road, this city, has invented a kind of Insecticide King potion based on the real experience of killing insects and scientific methods. By spraying or injection, bedbugs, etc. will fall when they smell the gas, and they will die immediately. The effect is great and I am afraid that people from all walks of life will not believe it. I have specially applied to the Shanghai Municipal Industrial Testing Institute to prove it as before, and I have received the 23rd certificate.</p>

<p>I have checked your newspaper today. The local news column on the fourth page states that the two warships were converted into merchant ships, and that Zhou Houkun, the chief of the shipping section, went to Beijing to inspect Jing'an, etc. This is indeed a misinterpretation. I have not been to Beijing in the past two months, and I have never inspected Jing'an. Please publish it in the letters column to correct it. Sincerely, Zhou Houkun, August 24.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, I have just read your newspaper's report on the 23rd of this month, on the fourth page, about the police chief of the second precinct's inner service being bribed to release the head of the smugglers of small goods, Yu Maogui, and being replaced by A Da (nickname Xiao Mapi) and three others. It is said that I am also suspected of a major crime, which is very shocking. After investigating the case, a total of six people, including Yu Maogui, were arrested. When the case was handed over, Yu Maogui happened to have a fever, so he asked his friend Zhang Shaorong to ask the police chief to temporarily keep Yu Maogui for medical treatment on the way and send his nephew Yu Ada to the case instead. However, I was not aware of the previous situation beforehand, and the police chief did not report it. After learning the information, I immediately investigated and sent the police to arrest Yu Maogui and the guarantor Zhang Shaorong. Together with the police chief of the inner service, they were all sent to the bureau for interrogation. I have no suspicion of involvement in this case. Now, what is reported in your newspaper is not consistent with the facts. I should write a letter and hope to check it and give a correction to clear up the doubts. Sincerely, Jiang Sheng, Chief of the Second Precinct of the Third District, August 24.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, I have just read a news item on the fourth page of your newspaper on August 24 about investigating the illegal detention of people, which is not consistent with the facts. It was found that Dong Yuhua was surrounded by local people, and Zhang Chuanzhong was arrested and handed over to the post office and taken to the bureau. Then, the Second District Office released him on bail. The injured person, Zhang Chuanzhong, has already proven his injuries in court according to law. Mr. Wang neither interfered nor brought the police to arrest him illegally. I believe that the interview was inaccurate. I am especially writing a special letter to clarify and correct it, so as to fulfill the responsibility of the local notary. I hope that you will immediately publish it in the correction column to correct the hearing. Please, Shenbao Museum, Jin Maoji Xieji Transportation Company, Nanzhan Tonghe Xie Company, and Tongshang Xingji Company. August 24.</p>

<h3 id="e199">China Library Association Assigns Qiu Kaiming to Attend the International Library Conference (2) <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Investigation Undertakings</p>
<p>(1) National Library Investigation: The national library survey form compiled and printed by the association has always been valued by the academic community. The one printed last year was the fourth revised edition. At the same time, the Department of Social Education of the Ministry of Education also printed a book of national library survey forms, which was co-authored with the Public Education Museum, so the number was relatively small. However, among them, the provincial, municipal, and county libraries have many places where the original form of the association can be corrected. Now, the association has continued to investigate for a year and has continued to increase. It plans to re-edit and record the expenses, the number of books in the collection, the classification and cataloging methods, and the reading status of each newspaper to form a systematic survey form, which will be published in a special issue in the 9th volume of the society newspaper, and will also be printed separately for purchase and reference. (2) Provincial Library Investigation: Last year, Hebei and Sichuan provinces sent members to investigate on behalf of the association. In addition to the reports from Hebei Province being published successively in the 7th volume of the society newspaper and the 2nd issue of the 6th volume of the quarterly magazine, the report on the investigation of Sichuan Province Library was published in the 3rd issue of the 8th volume of the society newspaper published this year because it was sent later. This year, in order to improve the guiding principles of library education and promote the development of library services, Shen Zurong, the president of the Wu Xiang Wenhua Library School, was specially entrusted to investigate the libraries along the way from Hubei to Pingdi via Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces.</p>
<p>President Chi went north from Han in early April for a period of one month before completing the task (3) Periodical Investigation: The publication of periodicals in our country is becoming more and more frequent, and there is a lack of complete catalogs, so the subscription of periodicals is the most difficult thing for libraries. Since the 16th year of the Republic of China, the Association has had periodical survey catalogs published in the association newspaper every period, which can be used for libraries to refer to. After the 20th year of the Republic of China, the number of new publications in the past two years has become more prosperous, and experts Li Wenyi have continued to compile the list, which will be published in the 9th volume of the association newspaper in the future (4) Bookstore Investigation: The association has always been very committed to the investigation of bookstores in various places, but our country has a vast territory, and it is difficult for the association to send people to investigate one by one, so it must rely on the support of libraries in various places to be able to help. This year, members were again entrusted to investigate, and the returned items were very clear, especially the Guangxi Statistical Bureau Library provided the most assistance (5) Rare Book Investigation: The Rare Book Investigation Committee was initially presided over by Liu Yizheng, and the achievements over the years have been considerable. This year, the special committee was reorganized, and the rare book investigation was merged into the Board Investigation Committee, which was still presided over by Liu. The following Song and Yuan editions will be investigated one by one: (1) Jiaye Library, (2) Songjiang Han's Library, (3) Nanhai Kang's Library,</p>
<p>Classification and Cataloging</p>
<p>The Classification Committee has made great progress since collecting the current classification methods. After the Jiangsu Provincial Guoxue Library's Cataloging and Classification Outline was published, the Association published it in the 5th issue of the 8th volume of the Society's newspaper. The classification is detailed, and the outline is in the outline, which can be used as a reference for those who are engaged in classification in various libraries. The society has also published Bi Xiaopo's Modern Library Cataloging Method in the 8th volume, which has been printed and will be published in a separate edition. As for reference books on cataloging, such as Ming and Qing Books Collected by , Ye Qidong's Examination of the Four Libraries' Complete Book Catalog Edition, and Xing Yunlin's Research on the Details of the Book Style Catalog, are all the results of the members' efforts in recent years. After the reorganization of the Cataloging Committee, Qiu Kaiming, the chairman of the Cataloging Committee, formulated a national library cataloging survey form, and first engaged in investigating the cataloging status of various libraries as preparation for improving cataloging methods and standardizing cataloging regulations. The form has been sent to each library, and a small number have not been completed, so the statistics cannot be published.</p>

In order to promote this kind of education, the Xueyou Bookstore and Art Society at 556-557 Fourth Road in Shanghai has specially hired experts to compile and print various science charts, using realistic pictures and simple text to concretize and child-ize the teaching materials of natural science, so that teachers do not have to laboriously explain abstract and superficial concepts, and children can have concrete and profound impressions. The published ones include physiology and hygiene, astronomy, and special animals. Since their publication, elementary schools across the country have been happy to adopt them. Now, three types such as meteorology group, botany group, and machine world are being compiled, and they can be published soon.</p>

<p>Special Correspondence from London by Yizhi</p>
<p>July 3rd (Monday)</p>
<p>(No games were held on Sunday, July 2nd) Today, a tranquil atmosphere pervades every part of the grounds. The overflowing crowds from Saturday are nowhere to be seen, and neither are the royal and noble spectators. No unexpected events occur in the matches. The weather remains consistently sunny, and even the weather forecast office expresses optimism. It has been nine days without rain, and today marks the tenth. Today is the start of the second week. The weather is exceptionally hot; the London thermometer rises to 84 degrees. It is even hotter during the day. Both those in the stands and those leaving the grounds are sweating profusely, seeking the comfort of the shade. The Wimbledon grass courts, parched by the prolonged drought, desperately need rain. Standing on them, one feels secure and not at all slippery. On the center court, Crawford's victory over Hughes was like a raging torrent sweeping him away. Hughes no longer exhibited the bravery he displayed when defeating Sydes the previous day; he was merely like clay in the hands of a potter. Crawford, on the other hand, was precise, confident, relaxed, and agile, possessing an admirable command of the game. He demonstrated his improved tennis skills with forceful smashes executed with unwavering precision. In the first two sets, he won five consecutive games and conceded only one. In the third set, Hughes gradually regained his composure, taking a 4-2 lead. However, the Australian ultimately prevailed with a score of 7-5. Crawford's victory was expected, but not by such a wide margin.</p>
<p>Stoffen, appearing half-crippled from fatigue, deserves commendation for winning the first set against Cochon, and for fighting fiercely in the second set. Stoffen was hampered by his injury, his injured finger causing considerable inconvenience. Ultimately, he lost due to his cautious play. Stoffen pressured Cochon with his powerful serves, but his mistake was to follow up his serves to the net instead of waiting behind the baseline for weaker returns. Cochon seemed flustered, lacking energy and power. He gradually recovered his form and committed numerous errors, which was surprising given his recent performances. His upcoming match against Vines will be a major test. In the fourth set, Stoffen only managed to win one game.</p>
<p>The leading British female player, Miss Hee (right), is defeated by Mrs. Marty (left).</p>
<p>Morell and Vines engaged in a fierce four-set battle, mostly along the baseline, alternating between sharp cross-court shots and aggressive volleys at the net. The match was held on center court. Morell won the third set 6-3, but did not appear to be a likely winner overall. The match proceeded quietly. Vines gave the impression of not exerting his full effort, constantly changing his shots as if experimenting with various techniques. Sometimes she let the ball go where it may, as if only wanting to hit it cleanly. She would tighten and loosen her grip, making it difficult for her opponent to predict her next move.</p>
<p>Vines won the first set 6-1, demonstrating how tennis should be played. Morell was not as weak as the score suggested. Morell's footwork was hindered by her jumping, which disrupted her serve. After breaking Morell's serve to take a 4-1 lead, Vines reached her peak but then stopped using her fastest shots, giving Morell no chance to respond.</p>
<p>Vines played more gently in the second set. After a 4-4 tie, she broke Morell's serve and then won her own. Vines seemed to be putting on a show. She conceded the third set and then accelerated again in the fourth, taking a 4-1 lead and winning 6-3. Vines appeared thoughtful during the match, but her spirit was excellent. Once, after winning a point by hitting Morell's serve, she insisted on a replay because she had touched the ball with her racquet. Morell seemed more susceptible to the heat than Vines, and admired Vines' victory. She occasionally exclaimed beautiful sounds before the ball arrived. A year ago, on a court that was less dry and firm than today, Austin defeated Sato. Today, however, things were very different. After losing the first two sets, Austin was unable to recover. Austin broke Sato's serve in the first set, offering a glimmer of hope, but Sato responded with pressure to seize the set 7-5. Sato gained an early advantage in the second set, intensifying his pace to win 6-3. Sato, satisfied with his easy victory, eased up, and Austin won the third set 6-2 with careful and powerful shots. Such caution often leads to failure, and ultimately, Austin's serve secured the fourth set. Notably, the shots controlling the game were not deep, and there was little footwork.</p>
<p>With the match tied, the aroused Sato began to pressure the struggling Austin, taking a 4-2 lead. He served powerfully to make it 5-2. In the final point of the deciding game, Austin exerted all his strength. There were two deuces, and Sato finally won 6-2 with a powerful shot.</p>
<p>The match lacked excitement and intensity, but it was a steady, attentive, and thoughtful contest. Sato, unlike Austin, had more stamina to recover in the fourth set, and he was able to apply pressure early in the fifth set. The center court was filled with spectators, all hoping for an English victory, but they were in good spirits and gave Sato a full round of applause.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bayot won 6-4, 6-1. The Swiss woman gained momentum and won three consecutive games, causing some surprise. However, Mrs. Marty seemed impatient in the hot weather and allowed her to dictate the game, making some unnecessary mistakes. In the second set, Bayot ran out of strength and surrendered without resistance.</p>
<p>Spears and Burke, against the veteran team of Boughlot and Bruin, tied the second set 6-2, raising hopes for a comeback. Ball's sweeping shots mixed with inexplicable errors, and Bruin's overhead smashes lacked accuracy. With Spears' serves frequently winning points and Burke providing solid support, there seemed to be a chance of continued success. However, they gradually succumbed to errors, especially Spears. The French seized the opportunity to win with two scores of 6-4.</p>
<p>On the outer court, Mrs. Godfrey and Mrs. Mykal defeated Miss Skrivan and Miss Siga 7-5, 7-5 in a special match. More investigation is needed in doubles matches. Her posture was not good, and Siga lacked a significant amount of strength. Gomi's victory was well-deserved. Mixed doubles matches are underway, but nothing noteworthy has occurred.</p>

<h3 id="e230">The Mystery of Legs <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Everyone has legs, but the way they are used varies. I think: a policeman's legs are made of telephone poles; a postman's legs are made of bamboo from the garden; a rickshaw puller's legs are made of drumsticks; a wealthy tycoon's legs are made of coffin planks. These four constitute the mystery of legs.</p>
<p>The first mystery is easy to guess. When a policeman stands guard, his legs remain firmly planted, almost like a telephone pole, so they are said to be made of telephone poles.</p>
<p>The second mystery is that a postman's legs and bamboo from the garden certainly have some similarities. Bamboo brings news of peace, and a postman's legs also carry the mission of delivering news of peace. This is a similarity in nature. Bamboo is wrapped in green bamboo skin, and a postman's legs are also wrapped in green gaiters. This is a similarity in form.</p>
<p>The third mystery is that when a rickshaw puller runs, his feet hit his buttocks. Although they don't actually hit his buttocks, they are very close. Since his buttocks become a drum, his legs become drumsticks, so they are said to be made of drumsticks.</p>
<p>The fourth mystery is that wealthy tycoons rarely use their legs. They sit at home and want something, they don't need to move their honorable legs. They just press the electric bell, and if they want tea, it's tea; if they want wine, it's wine; if a concubine comes, the servants also come. When they go out, their legs are always inside a car, so there's even less need to walk. These two rarely used honorable legs can be labeled with two red paper slogans. What words should the slogans use? You can imitate the words pasted on coffin planks and call them: "Prepared but not used."</p>
<h3 id="e231">Yellow, White, Black <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Xianxian</p>
<p>White people are the darlings of heaven, the rulers of this world. Black people are specially created by God to be slaves to white people. Generation after generation, they are always ruled by white people. No one can blame anyone for this; the only blame lies in the differences in skin color.</p>
<p>Besides white and black people, there are also us yellow people, who are neither white nor black, stuck in the middle. It's truly awkward.</p>
<p>In the past, fashionable men and women, seeing white people being so incredibly white, wanted to artificially transform their yellow skin, which they were born with, into white, pretending to be white people from the ruling class. They would apply half a pound of vanishing cream and a thick layer of face powder to their face and hands every day, looking like Cao Mengde from the opera stage. But no matter how much you dress up, even if you paint a layer of white paint on your face, you're still a yellow person and can't pretend to be white. Although this is very regrettable, this is how God created things. Cows eat rice stalks, ducks eat grain, and no one can envy anyone.</p>
<p>Recently, fashionable men and women have transformed into modern men and women. They have also changed their style of dyeing their skin and are competing to become black. Their skin, which was originally sallow, has gradually become one percent whiter after years of pickling in vanishing cream and powder. Now, suddenly, large numbers of people are rushing to the Takahashi beach, soaking in the seawater, lying on the sand, and letting the sunlight, at about 100 degrees, bake their unsightly yellow skin from yellow to brown to black, so black that Indians shy away and Negroes concede defeat. Only then is it considered beautifully black.</p>
<p>It was still understandable to want to be a white person with a yellow base in the past, because they wanted to jump from the quasi-slave status of a semi-colony to a ruler. After decades of drawing a tiger, they achieved nothing. Now they suddenly want to become black people with a yellow base. I really don't know what they're thinking. Could it be that being a quasi-slave isn't crisp enough, so they want to take a step further and seek to be a formal slave of white people?</p>
<p>I don't think a black person with a yellow base is more popular than a formal black person. We should still follow Korea and Manchuria and be slaves to yellow people.</p>
<h3 id="e232">A Visit to the Women's Temperance Home Economics School <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Zhicheng</p>
<p>In recent months, I have often heard news about the Women's Temperance Home Economics School. This not only piqued my curiosity, but I also needed to find such a school to remedy my daughter's lack of education. However, to be cautious, I first went to visit. The school is located at the intersection of Jiangwan and Xiangyin Roads. That day, I walked into the school gate, handed in my business card, and after a while, a simply dressed middle-aged woman came out. She nodded amiably to me, and I explained my intention. She said, "We welcome your visit to our school. Please come in!" As she spoke, she pointed her hand forward. I followed her up the stone steps and into the building. To the right was a very clean reception room, and it is said that the tablecloths on the tables were all woven by the students themselves. Behind the reception room was a staircase. To the left was a classroom. The teacher was teaching a lesson, teaching new methods of infant care. Behind it was a large classroom where more than thirty students were preparing for a microbiology lesson. I stood there, and they didn't mind at all. Later, we went up to the second floor, where there were six rooms of various sizes, one was an infant care practice room, one was a practical kindergarten, and the rest were classrooms, sewing, and embroidery rooms. The third floor was the teachers' dormitory. Walking back, we arrived at the kitchen and dining hall. At that time, there were several girls in white aprons cooking in the kitchen. After being introduced by the female teacher, I said, "Your aprons are so elegant!" They were not shy at all, and one of them said, "This is our self-made uniform." The receptionist smiled at me and said, "We don't normally allow men to visit, but since your daughter is coming to study, we'll make an exception!" I thanked her a few times, and we went to the simple but very clean bedrooms. As I was about to leave, she told me again: "Our school was founded by the Women's Christian Temperance Union. The purpose is: 1) to cultivate healthy motherhood, 2) to train hard-working women to engage in rural women's liberation movements in the future or to work as managers in urban families; 3) to create opportunities for girls from poor families to study and to remedy the lack of education for a group of women who have dropped out of school." I think this school is well-run and has excellent content, so I am introducing it to readers and offering it to women who aspire to study home economics. (Remuneration declined)</p>
<h3 id="e233">Taking a Noon Nap <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Xia Tianwu</p>
<p>"Noon nap," is commonly referred to as "taking a midday siesta." Indeed, during the long summer days, the days are short and the nights are long. People are busy all day, and at night, they still can't get a good sleep. For example, poor people are enemies with mosquitoes and bedbugs, hunting them all night; the middle class can't afford electric fans and air conditioning, suffering from the oppressive heat and fanning themselves incessantly, unable to sleep soundly until dawn; the wealthy live in a world of leisure at night, with dance halls, movie theaters, and grand hotels...</p>
<p>Therefore, in summer, people from all three classes, upper, middle, and lower, do not get enough sleep at night.</p>
<p>Lack of sleep at night makes people feel tired during the day, especially with the midday heat and the quieter streets. After a satisfying meal, they sit quietly in a corner. "Reading already feels heavy on the brow, and lying down brings comfort to the bones." If the eyelids naturally droop, then having time for a "midday siesta" is a rare blessing.</p>
<p>Here are two poems that perfectly express the sweetness of "taking a midday siesta":</p>
<p>"Waiting for the futon, the sleep is long, the host and guest forget each other. Soon the guest leaves and the host wakes, half the west window has no sunset." -- Lu Fangweng.</p>
<p>"Paper screen, tile pillow, bamboo mat, a book tossed aside, a long midday dream. Waking up with a chuckle and a smile, several fishing flutes sound in the waves." -- Cai Chizheng.</p>
<p>Schools have summer vacations because students "doze off" in class. Otherwise, if classes were held as usual during the summer vacation, two-thirds of the time would be spent "dozing off." If people are fortunate enough to take a "midday siesta" every day in summer, it shouldn't be considered laziness, because it is a physiological function. Ma Xiangbo once said: "My way of maintaining health is not some miraculous method. I eat and drink in moderation every day, and after lunch, I close my eyes and sit quietly, eliminating distracting thoughts, and take a nap..." This shows that "taking a midday siesta" is still a secret to good health. It may seem uneconomical to waste time on a "midday siesta" every day, but overall, extending one's lifespan compensates for the time spent each day. Therefore, "taking a midday siesta" is an economical and life-extending method.</p>

<p>Chapter 14: Difficult Marriage, Hesitant Worries; Inviting Friends for a Small Gathering, Reluctantly Recalling the Past</p>
<p>Mrs. Jiang stood up, wiping her wet hands with her apron, and repeatedly said, "Please come in and sit, please come in and sit." Guan Yaowu entered the house, took off his hat, and bowed deeply to Mrs. Jiang, saying, "Congratulations, congratulations!" Mrs. Jiang smiled, "What's there to congratulate?" Guan Yaowu said, "Is my cousin at home?" Mrs. Jiang said, "You are an elder brother. If you intend to make this a good match with my cousin, you have to do it properly and don't joke with her. Please sit down." Mrs. Jiang threw out the laundry water, swept the house hastily, and then sat down opposite Guan Yaowu. Immediately she stood up again and smiled, "Look at me, I'm so busy that I forgot to prepare tea and cigarettes for the guest." Guan Yaowu waved his hand, "Don't bother, I didn't come for tea and cigarettes. I'm now asking you a question as a cousin. You always approve of this marriage and have no objections?" Mrs. Jiang said, "Even in business, you can't go back and forth. Marriage is a big deal. There's no reason to say one thing today and another thing tomorrow. But there are still many things to discuss. First..." Before she could state her condition, she heard a crisp voice from inside the house calling "Mom." Mrs. Jiang thought that maybe her daughter had some preconditions, so she answered and went into the room. She saw Guizhi sitting in the room alone, looking up at the ceiling, smiling slightly, just calling "You come in." Mrs. Jiang said, "There's nothing wrong. Why did you call me in?" Guizhi said, "If there was something, I wouldn't dare to ask you to come in. Didn't you say yesterday that you wouldn't care anymore? Since you're not caring anymore, why are you babbling so much in the outer room?" Guan Yaowu said, "Cousin, what's wrong with you? Is there anything else to discuss?"</p>

<p>— Qian Taisheng</p>
<p>On the birthday of the lotus flower, Jiaxing, this city in the corner of the southern lake, all the people in the city, all the farmers in the countryside, from the small merchants in the county to the fashionable ladies and female students, from every road around the city to every small river in the countryside, everyone is like attending a grand banquet, like going to an ancient market. They bring some cash with them, wear new clothes, and rush to the Misty Rain Tower, the "South Lake" with its misty waves and shimmering waters.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, the boat ladies who park their boats on the edge of the streets and markets put rouge on their lips, wear fragrant flower water, and go to the Xuan Gong Bridge and Xin Ma Road to wait for their first customers of the day in their boat cabins. In the countryside, the sky is barely bright, and those proletariat crowds take the watermelons from their melon fields, bring their wives and children, and row to the city in their bare boats in the faint morning light.</p>
<p>The day before, small merchants and the leisure class who sit in teahouses ordered silk net boats from Wuxi and booked a sumptuous banquet in advance, preparing to play a loud flute and sing Kunqu opera with three cups of "Gaoliang wine" in the evening breeze of the South Lake.</p>
<p>At the East Gate, small ferry boats are parked on every riverbank, lined up neatly, close to the bank. The public ferries, which have raised flags especially for today, are parked at designated docks, flying white bamboo cloth flags with black characters.</p>
<p>The temporary public ferries for bare boats also raise flags, pulling people on the shore and shouting.</p>
<p>Under the dark iron foreign bridge, the public ferries are carrying full boats of people. The pretty ferry ladies, standing at the bow of the boat and shouting the number of passengers, often turn around to make a few crude jokes to the passengers in the cabin. The wind on the water and the powder on their faces, black with white, are actually praised by the passengers as "black roses" in this small city!</p>
<p>Boat after boat, large silk net boats, small ferry boats, and bare boats, the people on the boats use bamboo poles and oars to touch the water surface and row through the water. The wind of summer floats on the water surface. Passing the small Misty Rain Tower, the classical oriental Misty Rain Tower, surrounded by green, and a bright South Lake are reflected in front of them.</p>
<p>The Misty Rain Tower, this classical building surrounded by water and green gardens, an oriental building, with a pavilion, a hall, some rockeries, corridors, small pavilions, a small lotus pond, a small bridge, and the fresh, sweet, and tender South Lake water chestnuts are produced on all sides.</p>
<p>The four gardens on the lakeside are tightly packed with large boats and small boats. Boat after boat of guests jump down from the boats. Inside, they include women who have been refined by the urban soul with rouge, powder, and perfume. Black, green, soft silk and soft yarn, long and narrow-waisted cheongsams reveal fleshy arms. There are also figures in silk shirts, white straight pants, and so-called double-paid young masters, students; small merchants; still fluttering in white summer cloth long shirts and Indian silk Hangzhou silk wide trousers; small shop friends and clerks, wearing white short shirts and trousers, squeezing in the crowd, devouring line powder, mung bean soup, dried bean curd, and watermelons. Women who are slightly prettier naturally have a group of young and brave bodyguards protecting them, and the funny sound of spring chasing in the autumn wind wafts through the air.</p>
<p>The sound of flutes rings on the lake, and Kunqu opera spreads from the boats on the water.</p>
<p>White awnings, green small foreign boats, white clothes, shadows of women, four oars, hitting the water surface, and the sounds of harmonicas and silk strings faintly come through. People are still coming boat after boat, but the sky is gradually turning into night.</p>
<p>The lights are lit at the head of the Misty Rain Tower, illuminating the bright water surface. In the small ferry boats and the large silk net boats, the autumn wind blows coolly, and the shallow smiles on the eyebrows, corners of the eyes, and lips of the women under the night lights!</p>

<h3 id="e236">The Yellow River's Waters Come from Heaven <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>That great poet of the Tang Dynasty left the famous line, "The Yellow River's waters come from heaven." What can we do about that? We can only do our best and await fate. If it wants to meander from the north to who-knows-where in the south, we can only let it have its way. Wasn't the Snake King reborn this year? The breaching of the Yellow River must be the will of Heaven. Throughout history, only this line of poetry has truly captured the essence of the Yellow River; Li Qinglian truly deserves to be called the Poet Immortal.</p>
<p>The "await fate" school of Yellow River experts – the Free Talk section doesn't have enough space for me to trace their lineage. The historical records are insufficient, and some parts don't connect. However, regarding "river conservancy labor, prefectures and counties extract it from the Lijia system, with the Lijia assessing corvée labor based on wealth. If a family hires five laborers, the monthly cost is ten taels of gold, depleting their wealth and leaving them destitute. When the laborers arrive at the worksite, they demand everything, causing many to flee. Summons are issued to hire replacements, incurring the same expenses again. Officials only have the name of recruiting laborers, while the harm falls on the families of those nominally hired, and the benefits go to the supervisors of the works." (Memorial of Chen Yingfang, a secretary in the Ministry of Rites during the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty.) This approach of relying on the Yellow River's fate has been passed down through the generations and continues to this day. Historical records show that from July of the second year of the Jiaqing reign to August of the twenty-fourth year, the Yellow River breached its banks seventeen times. In the thirteenth year alone, it breached three times. In just the thirteenth and fourteenth years of Jiaqing, the cost of repairing and blocking the southern breaches exceeded forty million taels. River officials engaged in "rampant embezzlement, and the expenses were incalculable; aside from military expenditure, this was a major item."</p>
<p>Having "awaited" fate, it's time for the "do your best" school to step up. This school venerates the Great Yu as their founding ancestor. After the Great Yu, there are the Jia Rang school and the Wang Jing school. Jia Rang's three policies for governing the river emphasized not competing with the river for land, "Now, implementing the best policy, relocating the people of Ji Province who are in the path of the water, breaching Liyang, diverting harmful floods, and directing them northward to the sea... Using the funds spent on river management over several years to provide livelihoods for the relocated people; once this is accomplished, the river will be stabilized and the people will be at peace." The Wang Jing school's methods were the opposite of Jia Rang's, advocating for suppressing floods, claiming to have realized this from the words "spread" and "unite" in the Yu Gong's description of "spreading into the nine rivers, uniting into a counter-flowing river." Generally, from the Eastern Han Dynasty onwards, there were the Jia school of not competing for land and the Wang school of suppressing floods in river management policies. After the Jia school was implemented for a period, the Yellow River's waters still came from heaven, so they switched to the Wang school; after the Wang school was implemented for a period, the Yellow River's waters still came from heaven, so they switched to the Jia school again. However, the historians always said that by using a certain school, the Yellow River's waters did not come from heaven many times, to show that human effort should be exhausted.</p>
<p>In the fifteenth year of the Shunzhi reign, the river breached at Shanyang; in the first year of the Kangxi reign, the river breached at Yuanwu and Xiangfu; in the sixteenth year of the Kangxi reign, the river overflowed in all directions. Jin Fu was appointed Director-General of River Conservancy, and Jin Fu created the method of storing clear water to combat the yellow water, and using water flow to scour the sand. However, the Governor Gan Chenglong said that the lower river should be dredged, not retained, and heavy embankments should be retained, not built, which disagreed with Jin Fu's opinion. At that time, the officials supported Jin Fu's proposal, but the Kangxi Emperor sided with Gan Chenglong, and the embankment construction faction was defeated. Generally, the embankment construction faction and the anti-embankment construction faction exhausted their human efforts for the Kangxi Emperor. By the Jiaqing period, they awaited fate. In the fifth year of the Xianfeng reign, the river breached at Tongwaxiang, and it meandered to the north again!</p>
<p>Now, haven't the Yellow River's waters come from heaven again? Exert human effort? Await fate? Exert human effort and await fate? Therefore, throughout history, only Li Qinglian's poem has captured the essence of the Yellow River. Besides the Jia and Wang schools, a Li school should be established.</p>
<h3 id="e237">On the Literary Scene's Leader <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— He Ru</p>
<p>There are both methods and books on ascending the literary dragon. I say that today's literati all consider themselves geniuses and look down on others as incompetent. If people are compared to fish and dragons, then everyone is a fish, and they consider themselves divine dragons. How can there be so many dragons? A group of dragons without a head is the phenomenon of today's literary scene. Who is the head dragon, it seems, still awaits a genuine genius. Genius, genius, I truly seek it day and night. During the long summer days, I write this essay on the literary scene's leader.</p>
<p>At the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty, the court was in chaos, and the principles of conduct collapsed. Li Ying alone upheld moral integrity and elevated himself with his reputation. Scholars who were received by him were said to have ascended the Dragon Gate. Prince Zhanghuai of the Tang Dynasty commented that it was a metaphor using fish. The Dragon Gate is the mouth of the river, located in Longmen County in present-day Hezhou. The "Sanqin Records" by Xin Shi states that the River Ford is also known as the Dragon Gate. The water is dangerous and impassable, and no fish or crabs can ascend it. Large fish from the rivers and seas gather below the Dragon Gate by the thousands, but cannot ascend. Those who ascend become dragons. The term "ascending the dragon" originates from this. The reason why Li Ying could become the leader was that he was concerned about the country, loyal and public-spirited, had a pure heart and hated evil, made dangerous and profound arguments, did not hide from the powerful, stood up bravely, did not shirk from disaster, and was a model for the world, the chieftain of the partisans. Does the literary scene of today have such a person? Are there those who encourage themselves with this?</p>
<p>During the chaos of the Eight Kings and the Five Barbarians, internal stabilization and external defense were not achieved. Literati were distressed, and pure conversation was valued. Wang Yan was skilled in abstruse discussions, captivating the people of the time. The court and the public unanimously called him the Dragon Gate of the generation. Later scholars all admired and imitated him. It can be seen that Wang Yan was also written as the leader among the literati. I have often discussed this. Wang Yan's pure conversation was not a great evil. It should not be considered as farting, farting, how could this be true? However, he was fond of arcane emptiness, believed in inaction, and held an important position, yet he claimed not to be involved in worldly affairs. Therefore, he caused countless people to be misled and Shi Le blamed him for destroying the world. Does the literary scene of today have such a person? Are there those who can be slightly compared to him?</p>
<p>During the Qi and Liang dynasties, Ren Fang had a great literary reputation. He liked to associate with and promote others. Scholars and friends who were praised by him were often promoted. He always had dozens of guests at his seat. People at the time admired him and called him Lord Ren, comparing him to the three lords of Mengchang. Later scholars such as Liu Xiaochuo, Lu Chui, Dao Qian, Zhang Lü, Liu Xian, Liu Bao, and Yin Dan all came from his school. People at the time called it the Dragon Gate Gathering, or the Orchid Terrace Gathering. The so-called "gathering" is like saying a gathering today. The so-called Dragon Gate Gathering and Orchid Terrace Gathering are the names of literary gatherings at Ren Fang's residence, like literary tea parties today. As for those like Liu Xiaochuo, they hoped that Ren Fang would recommend them and use this to get promoted and make a fortune. Ren Fang was not only good at writing, but also excelled at taking notes. He could also share people's worries and enjoy their happiness. He was able to be the leader of the literary scene for a time. Today's rich people have never lacked those who attach themselves to elegance and seek to dominate the literary scene. Let me ask, does the literary scene of today have such a person as Ren Fang? Are there those who can seem to be slightly similar?</p>
<p>Alas! If genius does not appear, what will happen to the literary scene? Don't say that there is no one who is the head dragon, just be happy that there are methods to ascend the dragon. How lucky am I to be a member of today's literati!</p>
<h3 id="e238">Reading "On Continuing a Work": Another Explanation for Mr. Cao Juren <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Qiu Zhushi</p>
<p>Mr. Cao said two important things in "On Continuing a Work": first, for the sake of society's undertakings, continuing a work is not only harmless, but sometimes necessary, such as with "history;" second, literary creation is inherently social, so it is no different from historical works which need to be continued, such as the Water Margin. I extremely agree with the first point, but I cannot but disagree with the second point.</p>
<p>The task and nature of history are different from that of literature. It is a scientific thing. As long as the viewpoints and methods are the same, it is okay for a history to be continued or collaborated on by not just one or two people, but by dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of people. What about literary works? As Mr. Yu Pingbo said, "There are no good continued books (Note: referring to literary books). It is not necessarily that the talent and sentiment of the person continuing the book is far inferior to that of the predecessor, but because the talent and personality are different, just like their faces, forcing them to conform will only hurt both."</p>
<p>A "correct" point of view is necessary for literary works to be great and permanent. The same theme can have completely different results when written by two people with different points of view. If someone with a different point of view from the author of the previous work continues the work, even if it is not a "dog's tail continuing a sable," wouldn't it be "a bull's head not matching a horse's mouth?" Moreover, the themes taken for the continuation may not be exactly the same as those of the previous work? Then the result will confuse the readers and make them not understand what is going on.</p>
<p>Secondly, a "unique" style and a "special" tone are also important for literary works to be great and permanent. Let us assume that the point of view of the continuer is exactly the same as that of the previous author, but if the style and tone cannot be consistent, the continuation is still futile. The failure of the continuation of Dream of the Red Chamber (such as Continuation of Dream of the Red Chamber) is due to this, and the failure of the continuation of Water Margin (such as Conquering the Bandits) is also due to this.</p>
<p>Again, Mr. Cao said, "Since ancient times, everyone has participated in the work of creation in the chanting of ballads and the telling of stories. It is almost impossible to know who is the creator and who is the continuer. The Water Margin can only be said to be the joint creation of thousands and millions of people over hundreds of years since the Southern Song Dynasty. Even today, storytellers in Oriental bookstores are still doing the work of continuing the work." There is a grammatical error here. The singing of ballads through the ages is an addition and modification, not a continuation. The telling of stories is also an addition and modification, not a continuation. Only at the end is it written down and becomes the current state, such as The Peacock Flies Southeast, Mulan Ci, and various "bianwen," stories of Xu Wenchang, etc. Water Margin is different from these. Water Margin is neither a continuation nor an addition and modification, but a creation. (Mr. Cao has never failed to recognize this point, so he said that "The Water Margin can only be said to be the joint creation of thousands and millions of people over hundreds of years since the Southern Song Dynasty," but he suddenly turned around and said, "Even today, storytellers in Oriental bookstores are still doing the work of continuation," this is where the problem lies.) Although Water Margin, like the telling of stories, has undergone many years and many people's addition and modification, but the addition and modification is only a pile of materials. These materials must be chosen and forged by the heart and eyes of the author, and re-expressed with the author's own pen according to the author's point of view, before it becomes Water Margin, just as a writer obtains materials from real society to write literary works, hence it is called creation. Only in this way is the author's skill very important to the quality of the work. Try comparing Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Water Margin. Although they are both based on the materials that have been told, the literary value of each is very different, then you can know. Although the Romance of the Western Chamber has materials from Zhao Delin's Shang Ji, "The whole village sings Cai Zhonglang" (Note: the blind old man's lyrics are used), after all, it is not a continuation. Homer's epic, according to one school of thought, the meaning of "Homer" is "a collector of scattered fragments," then it can be further proved from Western facts that ballads and stories can be added, modified, written down, or created, and negate Mr. Cao's so-called continuation.</p>
<p>Originally, it was Mr. Cao "throwing a brick to attract jade, asking Mr. Qi Fan to talk about it again," but now it has become my tile coming to make a fool of myself.</p>
<p>Note: The original text is "The whole village listens to Cai Zhonglang."</p>

<p>— A Ying</p>
<p>(1) Idle People and Idle Matters</p>
<p>"Xia Wei Duan Die" says:</p>
<p>Wang Can liked donkeys and kept several at home, some of which were worth as much as a hundred gold. One was called "Fallen Hairpin," the second was called "Distant Journey," the third was called "Blue Bird," the fourth was called "White Phoenix," the fifth was called "Facing the River," the sixth ... the seventh was called "Running Lightning," and the eighth was called "Flying Star."</p>
<p>According to this, Wang Can kept at least eight donkeys, and these donkeys also had very pleasant names, some fragrant and seductive, some beautiful, some majestic, and some ethereal. Because of Wang Can's donkeys, I thought of golf, which is most popular with my family's young marshal. Everyone who breathes the air of a metropolis probably knows the tension and busyness of metropolitan life. However, when you occasionally get a chance to run into a golf course, you will feel that in the metropolis, there are also so many idle people of ancient times, pushing the ball into the distant hole, and have to push eighteen small ball fields and eighteen holes. It is natural to push a ball into a hole once, but it is said that it is also very common to push more than sixty times and not push a ball into a hole. A circle comes over, one or two hours, or one night, will waste you. Such a life is really worthy of the idle life of the leisure class, which is more elegant than Wang Can. When a friend took me to see it, he told me that this thing is no longer new in the United States. He did not say the reason why it is not new. I think this can be inferred. First, the thing should be constantly renewed to be interesting. Second, perhaps eighteen holes are not enough to waste. The thing that you want to consume when you have nothing to do has a broad future, so will the golf course with thirty-six holes, which is twice as many, be realized in the near future? However, from here, I see the decadence of the hopeless life of the declining class. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Shen Congwen</p>
<p>(Autumn, like spring in autumn.)</p>
<p>On the third-floor passageway of a certain hospital, a young nurse wearing a white cap and a white robe, carrying a small white porcelain basin, walked hurriedly from the east corridor to the west. When she reached the stairs, a greeting stopped her footsteps. A woman came up from the second floor, swirling on the wide zigzag stairs, wearing a green robe and holding a most fashionable vermilion leather wallet, giving people a feeling of "red amid green." The woman had a pair of long legs, making her walk very lightly when going upstairs. She was about twenty-seven or eight years old. Because the decoration was legal, it seemed that her age could be reduced a little. However, in the medical field, the marks made by time on this person cannot be concealed by artificial methods. That smile written on the corners of her mouth and between her eyebrows, and her demeanor, already carried a tune of "a beauty arriving late."</p>
<p>She could not be said to be very beautiful, but her eyebrows and eyes were delicate and refined, and her manner was generous and noble. Her body was well-proportioned, and the clothes she wore were very flattering, and precisely because of the late spring demeanor of "red amid green," she left a good impression on people that was not easy to forget after the first meeting.</p>
<p>Since she had been coming to the hospital on time this month to see a patient, she was very familiar with the nurse. Now, seeing the nurse by the stairs, she greeted her and quickly ran upstairs.</p>
<p>She said to the nurse in a kind and gentle voice:</p>
<p>"Miss Xia, how are you!"</p>
<p>The nurse smiled and looked at the vermilion leather wallet in the hand of the person who called her.</p>
<p>"Miss Ru, how are you!"</p>
<p>"Miss Xia, when did the doctor say the patient will be discharged?"</p>
<p>"Dr. Zeng said that he would be better in a week, but Mr. Mei himself said this morning that he wanted to leave."</p>
<p>"Leave today?"</p>
<p>"That's what he said."</p>
<p>The woman in green did not speak and passed the wallet from her right hand to her left.</p>
<p>The nurse in white seemed to understand what that meant, but then said:</p>
<p>"Dr. Zeng said, 'No.' If he doesn't sign, Mr. Mei cannot be discharged."</p>
<p>The door of a certain ward at the west end of the passageway opened, and a man in white with a shaved head showed half of his body and shouted to the nurse in the passageway:</p>
<p>"Miss Xia, come here quickly!"</p>
<p>The nurse said softly, "I'm not coming quickly!" She made an unhappy expression with her eyebrows and hurried away. Miss Ru stood by the stairs for a while, not leaving immediately. She saw a young, round-faced girl, holding a large light blue flower in her hand, supporting a young and handsome man, slowly walking downstairs. The man looked like he had just recovered from a long illness, his face pale, with a smile on his face, while the girl's face was bright and rosy, extremely happy.</p>
<p>A pair of beautiful and lively eyes watched the two people walking down the stairs in a zigzag pattern, until their shadows disappeared and were obscured by the screen at the stairwell. These beautiful eyes then stopped on the brown grass mat by the stairs, which was a small blue flower.</p>

<h3 id="e241">Financial Exchanges, Exchange Rates and Silver Prices All Rise, Gold Prices Continue to Fall by Ten and a Half Yuan <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>Foreign Exchange Tightens, Rising Midway</p>
<p>The U.S. Again Proposes the Bimetallic System, Still Downstream</p>
<p>The gold market fell again yesterday, due to the rise of the British and American silver markets and the consistent rise in exchange rates. The forward silver price on the Five Metals Exchange rose by 2.1%, and the private telegram silver price also rose by 0.5%. Although commodity prices and stock prices are slightly cheaper, people's hearts are quite bad. The opening price for the crude price was a sharp drop of ten yuan, but after the opening, the bank's appetite was extremely healthy, and the situation rose. HSBC quoted British flat and American up 2.5, which was not much. At this time, it was extremely flat, and the supply from the industry was quite strong. The Exchange Rate and the gold market showed a state of hesitation. Retail investors in the market had switched to force-selling, but the bank's appetite was still accepting, and the situation remained stable throughout. The forward exchange rate was even tighter, and the gold price tended to rise again, but because the industry's psychology was not tight, although it rose, there was much struggle, and although it was high, the suppliers were extremely active. After entering the market, the banks did business with each other. The industry learned that the U.S. Evening Post had reported that U.S. Senator Thomas would propose the adoption of a bimetallic system at the next parliament meeting, and the closing price returned to its original position. The "cooked red" price was still 210 yuan, and the swap premium for September and October was 7 yuan. Now, the market conditions for the day are recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 832 yuan, a small rebound of 10.02 yuan from the previous close. Commodities opened at 3 yuan. The opening price for the recent selling price of the exchange rate was calculated as British Exchange one shilling three pence zero six two five, and American Exchange twenty-eight and a half yuan. Hengyu worked hard to buy in, and Fuyu, Qianchangxiang, Zhifeng, Yongda and Decheng all purchased. Pan'gen also "扒" October U.S. dollars at 8.125, and rose to 4 yuan. Citibank came out with November 29 yuan and slightly retreated. Macquarie "扒" the same month at the same price. Helan further accepted December U.S. dollars at 125. Xunzhaofeng, Chang, Zhengchang, Fuyu, Yongfeng and others entered again, and it rose to 4.8 yuan. HSBC quoted British flat and American up 2.5. At this time, it hovered around 4 yuan. After entering the market, Yifeng, Yongyongfeng, Fuyu and Qingfa Yongfu Changlian sold, and people's hearts were depressed, and the Exchange Rate was slightly relaxed, and fell to 1 yuan. Huabi and others "咸扒" November U.S. dollars at 0.625 and were stable. Although Ruikang sold, Hengxing and Liangxing both entered. Pan'gen ate December U.S. dollars at 1.875 again, and rose to 3.5 yuan. After this, the situation stabilized, and the hesitation was quite quiet. Most of the gold industry was still supplying, and the bank's acceptance once stagnated, and retail investors turned to force-selling. Zhaofengchang, Tongtaichang, Shunli, Dacheng, Qingfa Yong and others came to sell, and it fell to 30.01 yuan (it had done 30 yuan). The bank was still accepting, and commodities Hengyu, Zhifeng, Yonghongxing and others came to enter again, and it rose back to 3.3 yuan. Ruixing and others supplied, and it fell to 1 yuan again. Huabi ate November U.S. dollars at 0.625. The afternoon close was still pulled to 832.2 yuan, and commodities were shot at 2 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon opening was 832.3 yuan, and commodities opened at 1.5 yuan. The bank was still accepting, so after 1.3 yuan, the situation was still stable. Pan'gen wanted November U.S. dollars at 0.0625. Qianchangxiang and Zhengchang slightly purchased, and it rose to more than 3 yuan. The bank sought November 29 yuan. Yifeng Yongyuanxiang entered to more than 4 yuan. Although Changsheng Yong sold, Wanxing entered, and there was a slight struggle. HSBC ate November U.S. dollars at 29 yuan, and Zhengjin "扒" the same month at 9.375. Daxing Yongheng Yu Fuyu and others hovered and rose to 36 yuan. After that, Hengtai sold and Yifeng Yong entered, struggling at 5 yuan. Commodities Qianchangxiang sold to 3.5 yuan. Fuchang Zhengchang Dafa Yong and others sold in succession, and gradually went downstream, falling to 2 yuan. Yuanxing Yonghongli and others all had purchases, and the situation was mostly sideways. The closing price was 842.2 yuan, and Liangxing sold strongly. Commodities slightly raised a discount of 2.5 yuan. It was found that the highest price of the day was 836 yuan, and the lowest price was 830.1 yuan, with a difference of 5.9 yuan. As a result, it fell 10.05 yuan from the previous closing.</p>
<p>The quoted price was HSBC's U.S. dollar listing up 2.5, at 28.125 yuan. The implied gold price was more than 853 yuan. According to the closing price, it was about 21 yuan, 3 yuan weaker than the previous closing. The logging price for this month was 843 yuan, September was 838 yuan, and November was 832 yuan. The morning water replenishment was 843 yuan, and the afternoon price was the same. The "cooked red" price was still 210 yuan, still because the futures price was low. In the market, Tianjin bang first sold to Yingfeng Heng Erping, plus 218 yuan. After entering the market, Tongfeng Hengzeng ate plus 203 yuan, more than 300 taels. Tianjin bang sold to outsiders plus 226 yuan. Tongfeng Heng sold to Hong Kong plus 230 yuan, about more than 300 taels. In the afternoon, the futures price rose, and the buyers seemed sluggish. At first, Tianjin bang sought to sell, but plus 222 yuan was not obtained. Finally, Yingfeng Heng came to accept. For the September and October swap, Changsheng Yong Wanxing each posted 35 strips to Qianchangxiang, for 7 yuan.</p>
<p>There was not much trading in the market, and it was extremely quiet. In summary, Hengxing Hengyu Zhifeng Yonghongxing Qianchangxiang Zhengchang Hongli Yifeng Yongwanxing and others were on the buying side. Dacheng Bingxing Tongtaichang Shunli Qingfa Yong Ruixing Ruikang Changsheng Yong Dafa Yong Fuchang and others were on the selling side. Dalian bang Wanxing entered a total of more than 1,200 yuan, and exited 1,000 yuan. Shunli entered a total of more than 1,000 yuan, and exited about 1,300 yuan. Guang bang Hengxing entered less than 200 strips. The number of strips left this month was 763, September was 2,457, and October was 26,201.</p>

<p>Yesterday, according to foreign telegrams, London's large strips rose by 125, both near and far. American silver rose by half a point. British exchange to U.S. exchange rose by 5/125, and U.S. exchange to British exchange rose by 4/125. The forward silver price rose by 2.1%, and the private telegram rose by 2.5%. The opening price for the recent selling price of the Exchange Rate was calculated as British Exchange one shilling three pence zero six two five, and American Exchange twenty-eight and a half yuan, compared to the previous close British hard up one two five, and American hard up three one two five.

<p>丨Yesterday Opened at Seven Percent丨</p>
<p>For days, the market rate for foreign call loans had remained consistently at five to six percent, lasting for over a month without change. The market's dullness was quite evident. Yesterday, a new rate of seven percent suddenly emerged, both in the morning and afternoon. The reason is attributed to a relatively large volume of imported goods, leading to a slightly profitable trend. "Hua tou" rates were also around two to three percent.</p>
<p>Call loan transactions on the market: morning clearing totaled over 4.9 million, new transactions over 800,000, annual market transactions over 500,000, small general association transactions over 600,000, foreign collateral loan transactions over 900,000, silver notes collected and issued totaled 2.23 million.

<p>丨Large Holders Preparing for Settlement丨</p>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Securities Exchange, settlement was approaching, with only two days remaining. However, both the bulls and bears appeared well-prepared, showing no signs of urgency or panic, and no signs of short or long squeezes. While both sides seem ready for settlement, the trading volume for the month was not particularly low. If they were still waiting to observe, the deadline would arrive in an instant. It was previously learned that large holders, both bulls and bears, were preparing to settle on the 30th. The number of retail investors was not significant, and it was difficult to ascertain whether their positions were floating or real. Such repeated hovering so close to settlement was quite rare.</p>
<p>Morning trading was not active, less so than the previous day. The market remained weak, with only small fluctuations of around three "jiao" for the 96 series, and only five "fen" to one "jiao" for others. The afternoon opening remained weak and lifeless, with trading volumes for all groups being sparse. Market prices weakened by another "jiao" or so, and trading volume further decreased at closing. Market prices showed mixed gains and losses, with more declines than gains. The final market prices for the unified issue varied from five "fen" to four "jiao" down, and the overall trend remained stagnant. The total transaction volume was 8,223,000 yuan, including 3,000 yuan in spot goods. The 96 series was particularly high at 1,455,000, unified salt tax totaled 2,665,000, demobilization bonds accounted for 580,000, the 1921 customs bonds totaled 820,000, the 20-year, 20-tax bonds totaled 1,210,000, and the entire six series traded at 600,000, with the rest ranging from tens of thousands to one or two hundred thousand.</p>

<p>According to a report from the New Fong Foreign Firm, the New York stock market was slightly weaker on Wednesday (the 23rd) than the previous day. Initially, the market rose across the board in the morning due to the strength of US government bonds, which speculators believed was due to the Federal Reserve Bank's purchases to promote the government's inflation plan. However, pessimism gradually increased in the afternoon. Nevertheless, market absorption was still good, and it is predicted that market conditions will change little tomorrow. The total daily trading volume was 2.58 million shares. Wheat initially rose due to the strength of spot prices but then fell due to long liquidation, resulting in little overall change. Cotton was quite stable but softened before closing due to selling in the South. Government reports were good, and ginning numbers were lower than expected. Brokers generally believe that the market has a slightly upward trend. The Dow Jones indices are listed below:</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks: 100.38, down 0.96</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks: 50.51, down 0.28</p>

<p>The yarn market is good because current yarn sales have been maintained recently. Simultaneously, there is talk that factories are setting limited purchase prices, bolstering confidence. Another rumor suggests that a high-ranking government official returning to the capital may have substantial measures for cotton yarn, leading to slight bullish activity. However, manufacturers are still aggressively selling at high prices, making the future uncertain.</p>
<p>(Yarn prices in yuan, excluding) Bidding for imported cotton was flat due to poor imported cotton conditions. Scattered short covering on the 2nd and 3rd disks caused the market disk to rise. There are also many rumors that manufacturers intend to maintain prices, causing tightness. Prices for various months rose by six, eight "jiao" to one yuan and one "jiao" and three "fen". The afternoon market atmosphere was still good, with various months rising again by one, two, three, four "jiao". Total transactions were 38,900 bales. Sales included 1,700 bales from Yuan Da, 1,200 bales from Yuan De, 1,700 bales from Heng Ren, 2,650 bales from Rui Da, and 800 bales from Heng Long. Purchases included 1,150 bales from Da Feng, 2,000 bales from Da Fu, 1,050 bales from Xie Sheng, 1,700 bales from Guang Yu, and 3,600 bales from Chang Feng. Closing prices are as follows:</p>

<p>(Current Sales of 810 Bales) Current yarn sales remain good. Statistics show that various merchants purchased a total of 810 bales throughout the day. Prices are flat. Purchase amounts for various merchants are as follows:</p>
<p>Xiamen 100, Inland 400, Jiangxi 10, Fujian 25, Northern Merchants 20, Fellow Merchants 70, Guangdong 30, Ningbo 40, Nanjing 5, Yunnan 40, Zhenjiang 35, Shantou 35.</p>

<p>The cotton market is becoming stronger, but the overseas cotton market is trending downwards. Local sentiment is good because Ningbo merchants are significantly covering short positions, totaling approximately 40,000 "dan" in both the near and distant markets, causing a tight situation and a sudden surge in the market. However, a certain manufacturer is selling heavily in distant months. There is bearish private news regarding American cotton. However, Japanese merchants have slightly increased their purchases of Chinese cotton in recent months, strengthening bullish momentum, although the volume of bales is not large.</p>
<p>(Zheng Biao Rises) Zheng Biao opened lower in the morning market. Due to the poor condition of imported cotton, the market was flat, with various months down one to two "jiao". Short covering on the 2nd and 3rd disks caused various months to rise by five "fen" to one "jiao", although the current month was down four "jiao". The afternoon market atmosphere remained high, with various months rising again by three "jiao" to one and a half "jiao". Total daily transactions were statistically 118,000 "dan". Sales included 3,900 "dan" from Yuan Da, 6,100 "dan" from Yuan De, 2,500 "dan" from Heng De, 3,500 "dan" from Ren Feng, 3,300 "dan" from Heng Yi, 5,800 "dan" from Yi Feng, 2,800 "dan" from Chang He, and 3,500 "dan" from Tong Xing.

<p>(Eastern Shandong) Areas along the Jiaoji Railway, north and south of the Yellow River, specializing in fine velvet cotton, such as Binzhou, Putai, and Lijin, produce approximately 200,000 "dan" annually. It does not reach Jinan but is transported to Qingdao via the Zhangdian Station on the Jiaoji Railway. Therefore, there are very few cotton merchants in Jinan. There was heavy rain on the 30th, with about 80% of the expected rainfall.</p>
<p>(Southern Shandong) Cotton produced in areas such as Caozhou Prefecture is mainly coarse velvet, and the quantity is small. It is not shipped to Jinan but is only used locally for making wadded quilts. In recent years, local products have suffered drastic declines. Farmers, due to the high price of cotton, planted 10-20% more this year than last year. Last year, Shandong produced approximately 600,000 bales of cotton, which were traded in Jinan. The cotton produced in Binzhou, Putai, and Lijin in Eastern Shandong is not included in this figure. According to the heavy rain on the 23rd of the 7th lunar month, all areas in Shandong received moisture. However, areas that had not received rain for a long time, such as Wuqiao and Ningjin in Northern Shandong, benefited greatly. On the other hand, areas such as Gaotang and Xiajin in Western Shandong experienced a sudden reduction in production due to the heavy rain on the 30th. New cotton will be available around the beginning of the 7th lunar month. (End)</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially strengthened due to good news from Liverpool but then declined due to Southern selling and long liquidation. As a result, spot prices fell by 20 "bang yin", and futures fell by 11 to 17 "bang yin". In the Liverpool cotton market, spot prices rose by 12 points, and futures rose by 4-5 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 14 points. In the Bombay cotton market, prices strengthened due to short covering in response to good American cotton news. As a result, Pingar rose by 1.5 rupees, Omra rose by 1.25 rupees, and Bairakee rose by 1.75 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated the 23rd):</p>

<p>丨Factories Intend to Maintain Prices丨</p>
<p>After the opening of the flour market yesterday, various months showed signs of initial flatness followed by increased demand. Prices for imported wheat, Chicago, and Canada were down slightly by one to three "jiao". Sentiment was flat after the opening price. However, in subsequent trading sessions, outside shorts covered their positions, and factories both sold and bought. As a result, the market declined sharply but then gradually recovered after that decline, improving by one "fen" compared to the lowest point of the day. When the afternoon market opened, due to repeated new lows on the market, factories considered maintaining prices, and the market atmosphere improved again. However, actual sales to customers remained weak, and factory inventories continued to increase daily. This type of sharp decline followed by a slight recovery cannot be predicted. As a result, the current month was better by two and a half "fen" compared to the previous day, September/October were better by two "fen" and two "li" and a half, December was better by two "fen", and January was better by seven and a half "li".</p>

<p>丨Afternoon Flour Market Recovers, Bulls Cover丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market, prices for various months were down slightly by one to three "jiao" due to imported wheat prices. Moreover, market sentiment was shrouded in a pessimistic atmosphere. Therefore, market sentiment was extremely uneasy after the opening price. The current month fell sharply again due to the proximity of delivery and the urgency of bulls to liquidate, and the lowest point reached 3.53 yuan, a sharp decline of 1.2 "jiao" compared to the previous day, marking another rare record. Distant months also fell by 3-5 "fen". When the afternoon market opened, the flour market rebounded, bull sentiment stabilized, and distant months such as September/October saw large holders continuously entering the market, causing the market atmosphere to improve rapidly. As a result, the current month was still down slightly by three "fen", September was better by one "fen", October was better by three "fen", November was better by four "fen", December was better by three "fen", and January was better by two "fen". In the current wheat market, because the standard price has fallen sharply and because traders have already sold their imported wheat in warehouses, reportedly at a price of only four yuan for 9,000 bales, the current market is also unimaginable. Prices opened at 3.65 yuan for Qintong wheat, 3.65 yuan for Gaoyou wheat, 3.63 yuan for second-grade Gaoyou wheat, 3.85 yuan for Wuhe wheat, 3.05 yuan for Chongming wheat, and 3.50 yuan for Danyang wheat, with the second grade at 3.48 yuan, totaling 7,000 bales, which were purchased by Fu Xin.</p>

<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday's arrivals were nearly number 30. Statistics showed that stocks in Puzhong were already thinning due to few arrivals in recent days, coupled with reasonable supply and demand. Only 50-60 boats were heavily loaded, while the remaining 40-50 boats had not completed unloading. Therefore, although sales had not improved significantly, market sentiment seemed to be strengthening, and the market showed signs of rising. The market was stable and firm, but due to weather conditions, prices were unable to rise sharply, hovering between five and ten "fen". Sales from Northern merchants were only a few thousand bags, but the market was still able to maintain its position. The Changbang glutinous rice market saw no gains or losses. High-quality glutinous rice from Sutongbang Nangang and Duyangjian saw prices rise by a few "jiao". Prices for thin rice such as Qingjiao, Songjiang, and Si were unchanged. Bianyin Yuan was stable. Dongxin Rice arrivals were quite strong, and sales were brisk, maintaining the original prices.</p>
<p>(Lu Bei) Yesterday, there were 16-17 boats from Heshia. Sales of various types of rice in the market were average. The market for white glutinous rice was stable, and thin rice, Yangjian, and Dongxin rice were flat. Du Jiao, Xin Ke Jian, and Jiaobaijian were slightly flat and weak. Chen Ke Jian Baiyuan saw no gains or losses.</p>

<p>Yellow sesame from Shaobang continues to be used for oil extraction, but purchasing appetite is not strong, making it difficult for cargo owners to sell. Therefore, prices fell again yesterday, with Yingzhou goods trading at 8.4 yuan for 334 bags and Suqian goods trading at 7.35 yuan for 150 bags. Due to excessive deductions, there are few new sesame arrivals, so there is no market.</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market maintained its firm trend due to a slight increase in Customs Gold. The association's clearing price for Grade 24 coarse white ordinary sugar was called up by two "fen" by the delivering merchants to 21.05 yuan. Later entrants returned to the original price of 21.03, with several hundred bags trading. Medium white sugar and Dutch red sugar also saw transactions. Taikoo sugar rose after initially being capped, with B mark rising by five "fen" to 21.45 yuan and CW mark rising by one "jiao" to 21.40 yuan. DY remained unchanged at 20.85 yuan. Chao merchants opened at 16.4 yuan for dozens of bags of yellow refined red sugar, which was of inferior quality. Zhenxing native factory white opened at 19 yuan for 40 bags. Zhonghua Guohua native factory ice sugar rose by one "jiao" each, with Grade 1 at 23.8 yuan, Grade 2 at 23.6 yuan, and Grade 3 at 22.8 yuan. Crystal ice sugar remained unchanged at 25.6 yuan. Refined white sugar decreased by five "fen" each, with the top grade at 20.3 yuan, Grade 1 at 20.1 yuan, Grade 2 at 19.9 yuan, Grade 3 at 19.7 yuan, and Grade 4 at 19.5 yuan.</p>

<p>Tianjin red dates are recently experiencing tight supplies due to depleted stocks, and local goods are also scarce, with prices remaining firm and high. Therefore, trading here is exceptionally tight. Top-grade red dates are sparsely sold to Southern merchants at 35 yuan, first-grade red dates are at 20-22 yuan, second-grade are at 13-15 yuan, and third-grade are at 9-10 yuan.</p>

<p>(Wuxing Autumn Silkworms Entering Third Sleep, Opening Leaves) In various cities and villages, this year's autumn silkworms are all improved breeds, and the weather is suitable, allowing the silkworms to develop smoothly. Unfortunately, mulberry tree production is insufficient, resulting in abundant silkworms but scarce leaves. The early batches have already entered their third sleep and are opening their leaves.

<p>(Huiping Rayon Sales Clear, Prices Firm) Yesterday, the exchange rate was stable, and rayon sales showed no improvement. Only Huzhou merchants imported 24 cases of Five-Star, Three-Star, and Lady brands for current and futures trading, priced at 181.75 to 167.5 yuan net.</p>
<p>(European and American Silk Sales Increasingly Lifeless) New York silk factories remain sluggish in their imports, and silk prices show minimal fluctuations. Lyon, due to Japanese silk encroachment, did not forward telegrams for Chinese silk, and the market is stagnant. Only Jardine Matheson and others imported 20 bales of white factory silk, and prices remained flat.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Ying Yuan's northeast route Gaozhuang Zhenmei green tea and British merchants Jardine Matheson, Paulson, Tongfu, and the Chinese Tea Company all had purchasing appetite, and trading was not sluggish. Among them, high-quality pulled core goods opened at 210 yuan at the top of the market, with no increase or decrease compared to the previous day. However, European merchants remained hesitant towards mid- and low-grade teas from Tunxi, Shexian, and other areas. There were no large transactions in the entire city. Due to Jardine Matheson's actions, the market was slightly more active. Other items such as Zhenmei, Gongxi, and Xiami, with excellent quality, had good sales, while ordinary and lower-quality goods were mostly stagnant. The overall tea market is showing a trend of increasing high-end goods and suppressing low-end goods.</p>

<h3 id="e262">"So-So" <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Bing</p>
<p>"So-so," in the grand scheme, explains the entirety of the decline of national character; in the smaller scheme, it explains an individual's lack of progress in life.</p>
<p>This is not a case of being unwilling to do something or simply folding one's sleeves and not doing it. Because this is a word used to "cut off" or dismiss a certain event, it clearly indicates that one had engaged to some degree. So one cannot say that there was no initial intention to improve; one can only say that one performed perfunctorily, without the courage to be thorough, to the point of failing midway and then dismissing it with a "so-so."</p>
<p>Examining the origin of "so-so," it's nothing more than difficulty and timidity.</p>
<p>A certain matter, from beginning to end, from attempt to success, inevitably, the process is fraught with many hidden difficulties. Breaking through these difficult points allows one to reach the end, to reach success; otherwise, one stops before the turning point and inevitably sighs, "So-so, let's just leave it at that."</p>
<p>So "difficulty" is the first formidable enemy of "so-so."</p>
<p>However, difficulty is just difficulty, and it can ultimately be conquered. As the saying goes, "Nothing is difficult in the world for one who sets his mind to it," and "Difficulty is the lighthouse of success," succinctly explaining that "success depends on human effort." However, this human effort ultimately requires a courage of perseverance and indomitable spirit; only then can one break through the difficult barriers. If one is timid and does not advance, the result will inevitably be "so-so."</p>
<p>So "timidity" is the second formidable enemy of "so-so."</p>
<p>During the late Qing Dynasty, the Treaty of Livadia failed with Russia, but it was later restored through negotiations by Marquis Tseng. This alone monopolized the glory of diplomatic history. His father, Zeng Guofan, was able to recover half of the country that had been seized by the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom by training local militias. Both of these men bravely overcame difficulties and never resorted to "so-so." (The fact that Zeng Guofan was enslaved by the Manchus but did not harbor misguided notions of nationalism is another matter.)</p>
<p>In this day and age, there are many difficult things, but few brave people. From high officials to commoners, all are huddled under the smokescreen of "so-so," unable to extricate themselves.</p>
<p>Looking at any individual, ask him how his work is going, and the answer will almost always be, "So-so."</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>In reality, there are indeed many people who are unwilling to tackle difficult tasks. For those things that they are willing to do, if they encounter difficulties, they change direction, turn around, and ignore them.</p>
<p>On another level, "so-so" is even more a crime of empowering the strong, oppressing the weak, and burying justice. In any matter, one can disregard whether either side is in the right or wrong; the first word that must be brought out is "so-so." Only by saying it once and I saying it again can the matter be smoothed over. The result is that the strong prevail, the weak are held by the nose and unable to breathe, and justice cries out.</p>
<p>Even the idle friends in the alleys, happily kicking over a peddler's load of vegetables, always have a third party chime in with a few "so-so" to settle the matter.</p>
<p>"So-so" is like this: It is the great enemy of successful endeavors and the upholding of justice. To put it more bluntly, because of "so-so," what is done is equivalent to not being done. Mediating the affairs of others means serving as a helper for the strong.</p>
<h3 id="e263">Three Major Reasons for Women Remaining Single <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Bin</p>
<p>Women are also members of the populace, and the importance of their position needs no further elaboration! Since the founding of the Republic of China, influenced by European and American trends and guided by domestic pioneers, women themselves have become aware of the loss of their human rights over the past several thousand years and the urgent need to restore them. As a result, slogans and banners advocating equality between men and women suddenly became popular throughout the country. This has led many women with shallow knowledge, who only understand the term "equality" but not its actual meaning, to stray onto the wrong path, needlessly adding countless complications to an already weak nation! And what is the result? Their actions and wills have attracted the criticism and attention of society, who believe that modern women are too liberated and too unbridled! Little do they know that there is a group of women that you don't pay attention to, but who are very worthy of attention, and who are hidden in a corner of society? This is what this article is about: "Single Women." Based on our thorough investigation and multifaceted research, we know that they are definitely not unmarried because of broken hearts or old-fashioned marriages. They have a special psychology and feeling. After my many times of careful consideration! After many efforts, I have decided the reasons for their being single, and I will record them below:</p>
<p>(1) Fear Now that women's demands for liberation are increasing, some men are very enthusiastic to help them (?). The only way they help is by talking about love; and what is their psychology? It is either changing allegiance in the morning and evening, or abandoning them after the initial affair; there are also some so-called benevolent gentlemen, who put on another mask, and will do the trick of marrying again and again, even if their children are already in groups, they still want a divorce; such things, to the parties involved, may not be a big deal, but to the general women with compassion and rationality, they think this is an act of losing their minds and burying their reason; there is a sigh of "nothing in the world is more than this"! Therefore, they see through the men and think that they are all like this, and fundamentally begin to doubt, and then from doubt arises "fear," this concept of fear, in their minds, the more imprinted the more profound, the more profound and more solid! (2) Observation In the past, women only lived in the family, and their knowledge was not wide; now it is not the case, they mingle with men in the society together, they can directly and indirectly, or see and hear, all the unfortunate events that occur for the sake of marriage, and finally everything ends up being the loss of women; and she looks around at her friends after marriage, 19 are not satisfied, some are resentful because of family troubles, some are sad and indignant because their husbands do not cooperate; they "observe" the pain of others, on the one hand, she is gladly celebrating that she has not yet been involved in the vortex, on the one hand, she is trying to avoid all the marriage leads.</p>
<p>(3) Backing In the past, China seemed to have no share for women, everything was exclusively occupied by men; they were not allowed to study, and they were not allowed to work outside; they had no other way to think of anything except relying on men; so the quality of their fate was shifted with the men. Even if they suffered all kinds of oppression and injustice, they could only bow their heads and endure. Now the environment is very different! Everything has a share for women, once they run from the narrow family to the broad society, it is like releasing a group of caged birds, return me to freedom; in their newly felt feelings, they have aroused unlimited interest in their hearts, and have a stable career, doing "backing," in the material is both happy to deposit and use, in the spirit is free; comfortable and natural, those self-proclaimed women who see through the world's affairs, they look at marriage. It's like asking them to enter hell, steadfastly unwilling!</p>
<p>The above three reasons are all related to each other and occur, but the latter is the most important, this contagious unmarried doctrine, has now been a great echo; they deeply believe in admiring, the advanced life of the unmarried, and deeply sad about the family life of trouble and constraints, so the women who tend to this doctrine, are increasing day by day, but not decreasing:</p>
<p>Finally! I have to say one more sentence: most of the single women are knowledgeable, they are capable, thoughtful, if applied to the family, then the family organization, children's education, will certainly contribute more; unfortunately, they do not care about the overall situation, it really affects the society a lot: alas! 22, 8, 6, drafted in Meng Lou</p>

<p>Clerk Communication</p>
<h3 id="e264">A Huge Sum of Money <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>Editor Sir:</p>
<p>I am an apprentice in a small cigarette paper grocery store; the store sells various domestic cigarette papers such as Golden Mouse Brand and Beauty Brand every day, and the number is very considerable. In each small packet of these domestic cigarettes, there is a small card with exquisite printing and advertisements on the back. But I see that most of the people who buy cigarettes always throw this small card on the ground and rarely pay attention to it. I think this huge amount of printing money, isn't it completely throwing money into the water? Why not save this money and buy two fighter planes from the United States? Usually, you can write some advertisements on these planes; its power may be much greater than the current small cards! I want to find a way to get the domestic cigarette company to adopt this suggestion.</p>
<p>Sir, can you agree with this approach? Can you help me to publish this letter in the clerk communication column of your newspaper's local supplement? Sincerely, Yu Zhiqing</p>
<p>Editor Yu Jun's suggestion is indeed a practical and feasible approach. We know that every domestic cigarette company with a slightly higher status, such as Nanyang Huacheng and other companies, spends at least 40,000 to 50,000 yuan on these small cards every year; if you concentrate it, the amount is really considerable. The effectiveness of this small card is undoubtedly very weak because 90% of them are discarded. If the companies uniformly save it, it will definitely not affect the business. Wasn't the Red Tin Package (non-domestic product) implemented the year before last because of the soaring cigarette prices? As a result, its sales are still increasing. What's more, transfer this money to save the country? I think smokers will definitely not object. The authorities of domestic cigarette companies! You might as well consider it?</p>

<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Scene 1: Life and Death</p>
<p>Old man: Isn't that right? In the past, when it was this time of day, the old monk would ring the bell. Even dozens of miles away, you could hear it. People outside would definitely hear the bell and lead their mules home. Every hot night, everyone would come here to cool off, talking and laughing. But the world really changes fast. Not long ago, this place completely changed. Of course, this is also the luck of our village. Look, even the big tree that is more than 50 years old has suddenly died. It's really God's will.</p>
<p>Old woman: Alas! No one comes to light a candle all year round, and even the Bodhisattva doesn't bless us anymore.</p>
<p>Middle-aged C: It's useless to talk about the past. It's getting dark, and I've finally lost hope for my livestock again. I'd better go back. (Exit)</p>
<p>Wounded soldier A: Why hasn't the big brother who went to get the straw come back yet? I really want to lie down for a while.</p>
<p>Middle-aged B: Then I'll help you in first. He'll probably be here in a while. (He helps wounded soldier A up. The old man also hurries forward to help.)</p>
<p>Wounded soldier A: No need, no need, grandpa! You're so old, how dare I ask you to serve me? I can still walk.</p>
<p>Middle-aged A: (Carrying straw) Huh? Did they leave? Ah! You're still here. (Points to wounded soldier D)</p>
<p>Old man: No, the other one went in first and is waiting for your straw. Send it in quickly, spread it out, and then carry this big brother in. (Middle-aged A enters the temple)</p>
<p>Wounded soldier D: Thank you so much, I didn't expect you to treat us so well.</p>
<p>Old man: Don't be polite, "Rely on your parents at home, and rely on your friends when you're away," "There's nowhere in life that you won't meet"!</p>
<p>(Middle-aged B comes out of the temple) Look, this big brother is getting polite, he says you treat him too well.</p>
<p>B, this counts as... We common people are risking our lives, can't we even do this little thing? We are all common people, we were originally like a family.</p>
<p>Old woman: Soldiers like you who understand the truth are good soldiers. I have to go back, I won't accompany you. They will come to carry you in later. (Exit, but immediately comes back.) I'm really sad. The one who grabbed me and called me mom just now was really pitiful. Now he's being shaken so badly in the rickshaw, I don't know... It's good to say it's not bad; I don't know if he's still okay. I'm afraid there's no one left.</p>
<p>Middle-aged B: Who knows? That military doctor is really hateful, if he hadn't run fast, I would have wanted to beat his mother to death.</p>
<p>(Middle-aged A comes out carrying a piece of broken board. Calls to B to carry wounded soldier D in.)</p>
<p>Voice: ...Run! ...They're coming.</p>
<p>Old woman: What is it again? (Soliloquy)</p>
<p>Voice: Run! Everyone get out of the way! (From noisy to gradually clear.) ...The soldiers are coming</p>
<p>Old woman: Oh! God, the soldiers are coming again</p>
<p>(She runs in a panic, but immediately shouts loudly.) Run! Soldiers, soldiers are coming, Japanese soldiers are coming! (Exit)</p>
<p>Middle-aged A: (Comes out of the door.) Are the Japanese soldiers coming? Ah! The Japanese soldiers are coming... (He asks loudly into the distance) Are they Japanese soldiers? Are they really Japanese soldiers?</p>
<p>Voice: Run quickly, the soldiers are coming...</p>
<p>Old man: (Following behind middle-aged B comes out of the door.) What's going on?</p>
<p>Middle-aged B: Are they really Japanese soldiers?</p>
<p>Middle-aged A: (Preparing to run) Who knows. They just shout soldiers. No matter what, let's go.</p>

<h3 id="e267">Poverty in the American Film Industry <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— Hou Feng</p>
<p>In the history of American film art, we cannot find the changes in artistic trends like those in Germany. Expressionist films and Romanuc films are unique to Germany. American films can be said to have no content at all. We can review the content only when art has progressed and changed; but with American films that have no content, this review is very difficult. What is the degree of evolution from the golden age of silent films to the current rise of sound films?</p>
<p>The American film industry can be said to be at the extreme of poverty and exhaustion. The unprecedented economic recession has directly affected the film audience, and the number of moviegoers in each cinema is much less than before!</p>
<p>Of course, the so-called golden age of art is the era when food, clothing, and shelter are satisfied. If food, clothing, and shelter cannot be satisfied, where is the need for artistic effort? However, people with sufficient economic means feel out of place with art; what they need is the curvaceous beauty of women, so the reason why Revue dance films are popular lies in this point.</p>
<p>Art originally often arises when artists are poor. However, this is personal poverty, not the poverty of the times. When the times are poor, there is absolutely no good work produced. Moreover, film is not a personal art. In this storm-like world panic, hoping for good artistic film works to appear is just a dream.</p>
<p>Major companies such as Paramount, Warner Brothers, Metro, and Fox have all been swept into the vortex of economic panic, causing some to reduce their executives and others to save expenses, all focusing on implementing reorganization. At the same time, to open up this situation, they are not using good artistic works but using entertaining and interesting works to grasp the social trend. This is the recent situation in the American film industry. The era of war and economic panic has no possibility of producing true art. Film is one of the five major industries in the United States, and in this period of sharp economic panic, it cannot escape the scope of this panic.</p>
<p>Film producers who lack accurate feelings, no matter how hard they try to create art, are ultimately impossible. Their conscience has already been lost. They can only offer some ordinary and tasteless films without artistic value to the American moviegoers who have forgotten criticism.</p>
<p>The American film producers' flood-like release of films with ordinary tastes and fierce violence is a ruthless aspect of 1933 and a stain on the history of film art. Revue films originally disappeared for a while, and we thought this was a deformed child of the early stage of sound films. However, recently, the voices of praise for Revue films in the American film industry can be said to be soaring to the sky, "24ND Suet" is the product they are praising like crazy.</p>
<p>Let's compare the United States with Germany and Italy! Germany, in the suffering of the World War, produced expressionist films and its reactionary historical drama films, while the United States, in the predicament of this economic fear, only has Revue films, sexy and interesting films.</p>
<p>In short, the American film industry is probably no longer able to produce true art!</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e268">Review of "Murders in the Zoo" <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Liang</p>
<p>丨Great Light Projection丨</p>
<p>After watching "Murders in the Zoo," I can tell the audience who come later without hesitation:</p>
<p>(1) If you have great hope for this film, hoping that it will make some new contributions to society, then you will definitely be disappointed and extremely frustrated.</p>
<p>(2) If you want to understand the actual life of society from this film, then it is still possible, because it can show you a layer of the current society. Moreover, this layer is the most beautiful layer.</p>
<p>(3) If you originally regarded watching any film as a pastime after dinner: then, I am not saying anything excessive, I can responsibly tell you that you can get a lot. Because this story is as moving and as true as its title; there are hand-to-hand combats between people, fights between animals, human wails, and animal roars. When you tell this story to others, you can definitely sincerely move many listeners, you can scare your children to run away, and you can scare your lover into hiding in your arms.</p>
<p>Speaking of the subject matter of this story, it is undoubtedly exposing the evils and ugliness in the most beautiful layer of current society. Naturally, some people will never believe that such things as evils and ugliness can happen in the most beautiful layer of current society, especially in the so-called upper class: but, the fact is the fact, not to mention in foreign countries, in our old China, for the compradors, landlords, gentry, officials and other classes under the current system, in order to achieve some kind of despicable desire of theirs, there are many who are working hard to create various kinds of evils all day long? This is something that no one can hide from anyone. The screenwriter of our "Murders in the Zoo" has firmly grasped this point. He powerfully depicts an animal scholar who occupies a very high position in society. In order to monopolize his love for his wife, he does not hesitate to use very sophisticated scientific methods to kill all the love rivals who are close to his wife. As a result, although he was killed because of this, the screenwriter's main point is impossible to conceal anyway.</p>
<p>As for the director, sound recording, and lighting, they can all be said to be very good. In terms of actors, the insidious and resolute attitude of Lionel Alwill, who plays the animal scholar, and the lively and true expression of his wife, Kathleen Burke, can be said to be successful. Looking at the whole film, it cannot be regarded as a film with high appreciation value among the films of the same type that the United States has transported to China in the past. However, if we hope that movies can take on a cultural mission, then this film does not seem to be what the public needs.</p>
<h3 id="e269">A Critique of "The Pirate" <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— Moore</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, "The Pirate" is still a film about the romantic entanglements of men and women, ending with the typical happy marriage. However, "The Pirate" differs from American-style romance films. Its story is a tragedy imbued with a sense of sorrow. Shikov, while privately in love with Mary Carroll, also falls into a romantic relationship with the Indian girl, Dina. But due to the friendship with Mackoff, the lover of Mary, he wanders the world, becoming a pirate. This kind of youthful Wertherian spirit, though foolish, is indeed very moving. Later, his union with Mary is merely due to Mary's deep affection; calling it love is more like gratitude. This type of story is rarely seen in American films.</p>
<p>At the same time, "The Pirate" also has its significance in its interpretation of religion. It is skeptical of "God," but believes that "faith" is necessary. This incomplete view of "religion" can represent a section of European figures. Naturally, surrounded by the tradition of Christianity, it can only attack other "divine religions" (Indian ones). It would be incorrect for viewers to assume that his attack on "Indian divine religions" is a protection of "Christianity." The subtitle, "If you have a spirit, I will go to the church to pray to you," the phrase "If you have a spirit," I think should be emphasized.</p>
<p>Technically, the director doesn't seem to have the power to control the story, especially emotionally. I feel that emotional scenes, which the director fails to fully grasp and portray, are a great failure. Furthermore, after Shikov becomes a pirate, the director's use of "sudden violence" to express the trauma to his soul is very good. However, in moments of solitude, there should be scenes and expressions of loneliness and sorrow because simply writing about "violence" is not enough. Also, when Shikov is torn between "friendship" and "love," the director should use every means to express his pain. To put it extremely, the most dramatic part of "The Pirate" lies in this area, which the director of "The Pirate" neglected.</p>
<p>In terms of acting, the male lead can act, but the director cannot allow him to give his best performance. The female lead has far fewer opportunities to act, so it's natural that she doesn't deliver a particularly outstanding performance. Other aspects, such as camera angles and scene divisions, are worth seeing. In short, "The Pirate" is not a particularly outstanding film. But compared to American films, whether in terms of story or technique, it is still acceptable.</p>
<h3 id="e270">Film Critics and Producers <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Xiling</p>
<p>Some friends in film production say: "Today's film critics only care about their own opinions and strict demands; they never pay attention to the difficulties of production. If they were to produce a film themselves, I believe it would be a mess." At the same time, some friends in film criticism say: "Today's Chinese films, in every aspect, are crude and immature..."</p>
<p>They both have their reasons, but they haven't fully understood or have overlooked the divisions and connections between them. In reality, critics do overlook the objective conditions of production. But producers shouldn't necessarily force critics to produce a film themselves. The producer's task is to explore his creativity and achieve his grand creations. The critic's important task is to illuminate the inherent meaning of a work and its value. To do this, he must know all the objective conditions of production and the knowledge of social sciences.</p>
<p>In order to seek the source of his creation, the producer can at least receive some clues from the critic, and at least some directional inspiration. Of course, he must also use his clear mind to distinguish the accurate path among the various criticisms. Critics and producers each have their own paths of self-cultivation. Furthermore, the progress of Chinese cinema does not lie in mutual ridicule but in mutual encouragement.</p>
<h3 id="e271">Japanese Cinemas in Shanghai <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— Chengda</p>
<p>丨The History and Content of the Towa Hall丨</p>
<p>At a time when Sino-Japanese relations are very "close," it seems that the Japanese film industry should also be worthy of our attention. I will now briefly describe the situation of Japanese photography halls (cinemas) in Shanghai. About four or five years ago, there was a Japanese cinema (I forgot the name) located near the Shanghai Grand Theater on North Sichuan Road. Because it was small and did not select films well, it soon closed down. However, the "Towa Hall," which has a history of decades, still exists. It can be said that it has become the only Japanese cinema in Shanghai today. Five years ago, it was located on Wuchang Road in Hongkou; now it has moved to the intersection of Zha Pu Road and Haining Road. The style of the entrance is not grand, but the interior is purely "Japanese-style" and extremely refined in its decoration. Upstairs and downstairs can accommodate two or three thousand spectators; however, the upstairs is reserved for female guests, with no seats but a thick cushion spread on the floor, low in the front and high in the back, divided into three levels. Each level is surrounded by a copper railing so that they can lean against the railing while sitting on the floor. There are also women downstairs. Tickets are priced at six cents downstairs and one yuan upstairs. There are no daytime screenings, only one screening at night, except on Sundays. There are many viewers, but soldiers and students receive a 50% discount on tickets. The films they show can be divided into "new" and "old." "New" refers to contemporary works, and "old" refers to historical films in ancient costumes, all with profound consciousness, and the techniques are absolutely not crude. The subtitles are aesthetic, very elaborate, and today they also show many sound films. Good silent films are of course not abandoned, and are shown occasionally. During the screening, men and women stand beside the stage and recite simple dialogue according to the scenes in the film, so that the general audience can fully understand, which is an innovation that no other country has. The theater is commercially operated, so there is no prohibition on saying "only nationals are allowed in," but in fact, foreigners rarely go to Japanese cinemas.</p>

<p>— Dake</p>
<p>Upon hearing a word from his wife, Du Sheng immediately pushed open the window and shouted downstairs! "You madmen, come on in!" He hurriedly put on his clothes, went downstairs and opened the door, and the crowd surged into Du Sheng's house. They said in unison, "We've come to say goodbye. We received an emergency order to depart for the front lines at dawn tomorrow." Du Sheng stepped forward, expressing sincere emotion, and patted Qisa on the shoulder, saying, "Really?" Qisa said, "Really, we're taking the train early tomorrow morning."</p>
<p>The Gypsy orchestra of Ji Jinxixi suddenly started playing music. A young officer in the crowd, Jiao San Heli, stared at Elena on the staircase, and everyone saw her. Elena said happily to them, "Good evening, or good morning. Welcome to have supper, or breakfast. San Heli bowed and said, "We only need to see you and we are happy." Someone said, "It wouldn't hurt to have some wine." Everyone echoed and laughed. Du Sheng then led the way, shouting in front, "Those who want to drink, come this way, there's plenty of wine here for you to drink." They filed in and entered Du Qian's dining room. They cheered and drank freely until the east turned fish-belly white and the first light of dawn shone through the windows. But their enthusiasm showed no sign of waning.</p>
<p>Elena secretly slipped out and ran into the large living room, pressing her hand to her eyes, deeply feeling the fatigue and dullness of life. And Qisa came in. He also called her over and said, "You haven't said two complete sentences to me tonight." Qisa said, "That's because we are together." Elena said with a smile, "This kind of place where everyone gathers feels like everyone is conspiring to prevent us from talking. Don't you think it's strange!" Qisa said, "This is called being near yet far, people's intentions are distant." Elena continued, "Inside the same room, you are on the east side, and I am on the west side, separated by many people's shoulders and strangely shaped heads, isn't it like being separated by layers of peaks?" Qisa said, "If I were to shout loudly to you, 'Hey, you with the most beautiful eyes, I want to be with you,' I don't know what kind of changes would occur in those strangely shaped heads." Elena gently embraced Qisa and quietly reprimanded him, "Then you don't need to shout like that. Haven't I already heard the voice in your heart?"</p>
<p>As they were talking in such a gentle and tender way, the Gypsy music outside continued to play. Qisa sighed, saying that Du Sheng and Elena had treated him so well these past few months, and now the time of joy was coming to an end. Elena said sadly, "If I had known this earlier, why didn't I..." (To be continued)</p>
