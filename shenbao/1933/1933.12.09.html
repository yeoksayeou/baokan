<p>時評</p>
<h3>運銷糧食救濟農村愼</h3>
<p>八省糧食會議代表。已於七日在滬集會。議决籌備設糧食運銷局。并已擬定章程。待批准之後。即將開始籌備。據會議記錄。運銷局章程第二條所揭示之宗旨。其營業爲運銷糧食。目的在調節糧價救濟農村。此種重大使命。論精力須全國一致努力。乃克收獲成效。論財力尤須藉政府之權能以應付此舉。乃能有濟。百萬資金。在私人經營。誠可視爲巨大之財力。而在調劑擁有三萬萬以上人口之農民。救援三千四百萬方里以上之地面。則未免盃水軍薪。補益恐不甚多。蓋我國農村之衰敗。已遍佈於全國。並非一省一縣之局部問題。譬如在北方。則地力日薄。從事於農力者。雖終年辛勤。樂歳猶不免凍餒。加以近代工業資本侵入中國以來。農村自給自足之憧憬。巳完全打破。農業生產物品。不復爲農村自用之物品。而爲商場中之商品。如能運輸便利。週轉靈活。或尚可保持現狀。無如工業國家之生產品。與農業產品。源源輸入中國。致我農村。日趨緊。迫糧食運輸。幾全停滯。以故豐收之處。米價跌至五元以下。而荒旱省分。依然餓莩載途。至改良種子。經營土地。更少人注意矣。此類畸形現象。如果任其延長。而不加糾正。即令爲太平之局。亦恐將釀成禍亂。况在今日外有强敵侵逼。内有匪患相乘之情形下耶</p>
<p>農業國家。處現世界正在轉換局勢之時期中。舊有農村經濟。安能抵抗資。</p>
<p>本主義之狂潮。故惟有隨潮流之所趨。幸偷朝夕之安而巳。不過在歐洲諸國。當十九世紀工業繁興之際。農村雖不免困難。而城市則次第興盛。同時可由殖民地市塲取得意外之財富。以補充其國力之不足。我中國固有不可數計之財源。藏於地底得以待開發。但在此競爭劇烈之時。自身經濟薄弱。欲急謀工業上之開拓。勢不可能。是以城市乃隨世界經濟恐慌而同其衰頽。氣力微弱之農村。更間接受其影響。而愈見疲敝不堪之狀矣。。</p>
<p>現在爲救濟農村經濟之策劃。須使農村經濟。週轉靈活。必令農產物品。不堆積倉庫之中。任其糜爛。同時尤須注意者。農民一般生活。已降至不能再低之程度。其於工業製造品之消費能力。幾等於零。故農村中之高利剥削。必需嚴加取締。收買期貨之舉。須由公正機關。秉公執行。然後農民乃飽逐漸回復其能力。城市經濟之轉機。實繫於此。蓋我國無論大不都市。其發達也。或賴政治關係如北平是。或賴商業流通如漢口天津是。上海雖有若干近代工業之組織。似乎巳具備工業資本之雛形。其實上海一隅。商業上之資力。較之工業資本。究竟龐大。而輸出貨品。又多爲農業產物及農業副產物。純粹工業製品。大多屬於手工業製造。總之我國國民經濟整個之繁榮。繫於農業方面者多。而繫於工商業者較少。不過因商工業資力集中。故其所表現之力量大。而農業經濟則散處四鄉。雖多亦不占重要耳。然究其實際。農村不得適當之救濟。則城市亦終將困窘而無由自拔。是着手救濟農村之初。所不可不注意者。也　　糧食之運銷。在我國固爲當前之急務。但未必能解救農村經濟之全部厄運。至少應能打消糧食停滯之病態。解除農村經濟週轉不靈之困難。此二端如能確實執行。則受惠者不祇主限於農村。即城市繁榮之回復亦基於是工業之發展。猶有賴於農村。故吾人於八省糧食會議之前途。糧食運銷之賣施。誠心祝禱其成功。并望其擴大至於全國也。</p>

<h3>法西斯式之國際新組織呼聲　英認意欲以歐洲唯一仲裁人自居　不啻對國聯下一戰書　法捷等國共商應付策　美重申不願與聞歐事</h3>
<p>羅馬　目前意大利之政策、似謀使德國重行加入改造後之國聯會、國聯會之組織應根本改革使成爲一種世界建築、而以西方四大强國所組成之指導委員會爲其基礎、由是則可將四强公約與新國聯會盟約互相混同、此新國聯會盟約、自將與凡爾賽條約完全分離、新國聯會之會所、亦無設於日内瓦之必要云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　法西斯大會所提出改革國聯組織織與目的之哀的美敦書、已使國聯處於分裂之途徑、此種情形、倫敦方面不爲諱言、位置頗高之某外交家今日與路透訪員談及此事、謂意國欲藉德俄國日本之援助、爲歐洲獨一仲裁人、此種情形之唯一結果、勢必爲歐洲民治國與獨裁國間之分裂、英國固或可主張折中辦法、希望國聯得以安然經過有建設性的改革、但各國中有欲修改凡爾賽和約者、亦有竭力反對此種步驟者、二者之中欲求調和、恐非易事也云、意國之哀的美敦書在此間人士觀之、將促進近東與遠東諸國另樹一幟之趨勢、此乃觀於巴爾幹與十耳其政治家秋間迭次訪問而可知者、近東與遠東諸國之新團體如果成立、則其所根據者、爲對於大國私自支配之恐懼、及對於條約修改之堅决反對、衆料無論國聯改革與否、美國終未必加入國聯、蓋美國國會不主張參加國外之糾紛也、此間政治批評家確信中國將反對國聯之改組、、因恐國聯改組後、日本復至日内瓦而處於統制之地位也、（七日路透電）</p>

<h3>如聞晴天壀靂</h3>
<p>（巴黎）　意大利最近含有恫嚇性質之聲明、謂倘國聯不有根本之改組、意大利勢將脫離國聯云云、此處輿論界聞之、認爲不啻青天之霹靂也、而政界方面、認法國政府之邀請捷克外長皮尼斯氏、之來法、爲自接到意大利法西斯大會决議案報告後之直接響應、皮尼斯約於下星期一二即可抵法、而其與法外長之晤談、聞己定期於十二月十四日云、此處著名政治記者波丁那氏在巴黎廻去報中著論聲稱、四强公約之成立、實爲意大利企圖修改和約之第一步、而最近之要求國聯改組則爲同一趨向之第二步云、並據波丁那氏之意見、首相墨索里尼實爲促成法西斯大會决議案之一人、而其動因則爲法國送達意政府之牒文、内稱、爲德國不重返國聯、法國將不批准四强公約是也、波丁那氏並謂法國之邀請皮尼斯氏之來法、實即可作法國拒絶意大利要求之解釋云、此外復有名記者桑白利士氏亦在巴黎日報中披露一重要論文稱、國聯現已入於解組之進行中、因各大國實已不願聽從國聯空想之指揮而無行使實權之能力也、其他各報亦都爲國聯抱悲觀、所著論文標題爲「日内瓦之毁滅」及「英法戰綫之殘餘」等觸目皆是、（七日國民電）</p>
<h3>美國不欲上鈎</h3>
<p>（紐約）　紐約時報華盛頓訪員電稱、美京一般人士對於法西斯黨大會决議案之評論、爲美國無可誘其加入國聯、如墨索里尼之目的在此、則其努力不能感動美人云、參議員波拉氏之評論曰、美國决不稍嘗此餌、（八日路透社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　此間官塲人士對於意大利汎繫黨大會要求改組國聯會事、發表意見、謂美國無論國聯會維持現狀、抑或實行改組、均不願加入、美國不欲與問歐洲政治之念、至今日尤爲堅决、聞蘇俄外交委員李維諾夫在華府時、羅斯福總統曾以此意直率告之、至軍縮會議之工作、雖願賡續參加、但歐洲方面任何政治計畫、其約束若較凱洛克白里安非戰公約所規定者尤爲明切、則非美國所能接收、一般人對於意大利改組國聯會計畫所可成就、頗爲懷疑、類皆認爲意相墨索野尼之巧妙策略、其目的端在充實四强條約、華盛頓明星報載稱、歐洲若干小國或認爲若干大國之「衛星」、恒於討論政治問題之際出而干涉、頗有不便之感、墨索里尼乃欲以歐洲各大國建蘇聯在内、主持一切、而不受各小國之筆制、墨氏并欲在國聯會及凡爾賽和約範圍之外、解决歐洲若干政治問題、至官塲人士則謂此項計畫、非法國所能接受、最近意俄兩國代表談話、其要點不在改組國聯、而在俄意兩國之接近、或繼之以俄德兩國邦交之改善、此蓋意大利認爲維持歐洲和平所不可少之條件也云云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>漢德森爲軍縮僕僕英法間　深以國聯基礎動摇爲慮</h3>
<p>（倫敦）　軍縮會議主席漢德森今日自巴黎返倫敦後、語人云、目下不僅軍縮會議前途、即以國聯爲基礎之全部「集合的和平」制度、亦正在危急存亡之秋、按漢氏日來曾爲列强與德外交談判問題、訪晤歐洲政治領袖多人、但結果尚未完全失望、表示渠仍希望此種秘密談判、將可產生充分同意方案、俾軍縮會議復可於明年一月召集、惟渠在軍會重開以前、則擬暫留英國云、（七日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　軍縮主席漢特森今午晤英外相西門有所商談、按漢特森在巴黎曾再三申明軍備只能縮減、不能增加、但英國傾乃承認德國一部分重整軍備之主張、此兩事實相抵觸、此間一般人殊不能加以諱飾、一般人以爲就各國自由允許之基礎、以限制軍備、並倣照倫敦海軍恊定、以定各國軍備之比率、此種主張較諸單純之軍縮計畫更易產生效果、蓋就近數月來事變之所指示、單純之軍縮計畫多屬徒勞無益、且多危險故也、如此種規定比例之程序、苟經各國承認、同時並實施軍備監察制度、則必能使世界戰爭之潛能、從實質上加以削減、因以避免軍備之競爭云、至於英國接受德國一部分重整軍備之主張、其用意在於使德國感覺與他國受同等待遇、而視爲滿意、但在目前開始之談判中、英國將力謀減少所謂一部分重整軍備之限度、換言之、一部分重整軍備必係萬不得已而後爲之、此外英國爲持平之計、將繼續使德國之各鄰邦從安全方面獲得慰藉、對於法國向所主張安全觀點之正當、絶不加以否認、但以上所述各項用意如何成爲積極之提議、則當視有關各國首都所遭遇之情勢而加以决定云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>羅馬　蘇聯外交委員李維諾夫致電首相墨索里尼、對於渠在羅馬談話情形、表示好感、謂「意俄兩國友誼堅實綿長、業巳證實此於世界和平關係綦重」云云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>美意俄結合對日爲共同目標　西班牙報紙之觀察</h3>
<p>瑪德里　自由報對於蘇聯外交委員李維諾夫應遊美意兩國一事、撰文加以評論、謂「意美俄三國與日本間皆多少有尖銳性之衝突、或至少有衝突之可能性、」故李氏歷遊美意兩國、不知是否爲美意俄三國締給同盟、預作佈置、該報繼將所謂「意日兩國間衝突之可能性」予以說明、謂日本推行傾銷政策、意大利經濟爲之感受嚴重損害、不寗惟是「日本以和平手段、侵入菲洲亞比西尼亞國、意國外交忸於勝利、不料竟至在亞國方面失敗、此則意大利所最爲忿激者也」云云、（按亞比西尼亞爲意國勢力範圍、最近日本人在該國境内取獲種棉讓與權、所謂以和平手段侵入、當係指而生、）（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>英國擴充空軍擬定實施步驟　四年内擴至五十二隊</h3>
<p>（倫敦）　據晨報政治記者所得消息、航</p>
<p>空大臣倫登德里業已採取種種步驟、俾將英國空中防禦設備予以充實、若軍縮恊定確無成立之期、則四年之中、英國將建造飛機十隊、空軍軍力將加至五十二隊云、按昨日上議院討論航空軍備問題時、倫登德里勛爵曾謂、「目前各國對於航空軍備、並未從事裁減、故英國在十年前業巳擬定之空軍計劃、决不能無期延緩、此項計畫、固英國國防所必需之最低限度也」云云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　航空大臣倫登特里今日於上院辯論阿蘭勳爵所倡拆毁海陸軍用飛機並將民用飛機移交一世界總機關管理之議時宣稱、英政府以爲組織國際空軍歸國聯調遣之舉、碍難實行、且不願出此、美國不能計議在日内瓦建設一太上國、且如是則國聯須於海陸置全副軍備而後可、此種混合軍以之對抗一頭等國、其有獲勝之機會乎、萬一日内瓦受炸彈之轟擊擊則吾人不能坐視國聯之失敗也、無論如何、必有强國而不爲國聯會員者云云、（七日路透電）</p>
<h3>比利時鞏固東陲國防　預算案通過衆院</h3>
<p>比京　國防部長特凡士、本日出席參議院發表重要演說、爲政府國防經費案作辯護、此項經費共達七五元·０００·０００比國法郎、將用以充實東境防禦工事、及增加戰時軍隊之設備、特氏說明比國在安全方面、頗多可慮之處、最近瑞士將一九三四年軍事預算增至九一·二００·００瑞幣、其意義頗足玩味、特氏繼謂目前國際時局如此、不得不增加國民負担、參院爲比國獨立及榮譽起見當予接受云云、右派全體皆表贊成、但社會黨代表、以該黨名義發表宣言書、謂將投票反對國防經費案、社會黨要求政府毅力行動、俾達到各國與德國普遍裁軍之目的、但若德國决心重整軍備、使種種努力歸於失敗、則比國當聯合愛好和平之各民族一致對德云云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>比國　衆議院討論常年預算案、業已終結、當以八七對六八票予以通過、又外交預算案及國防非常經費案各條欵、亦經先後通過、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英法談判順利進行貿易戰爭可免</h3>
<p>（倫敦）　英法兩國間之貿易戰爭、似可避免、今日路透社探悉目前英政府對於法方現對英貨進口徵百分之十五附稅及百分之六之落地稅之舉、並無報復之意、英政府對於兩星期來英法雙方謀和緩解决談判之進行、表示滿意、認爲談判當不致發生阻碍、且英國不願使地位漸趨穩固之法國新政府因此爲難、但談判如無結果、則英國亦將對法貨進口加重徵稅也、（八日路透電）</p>
<h3>松岡洋右宣告脫黨　並辭國會議席　打銷政黨論爲理由　與政友會極大衝動</h3>

<p>（東京）　日軍部所造成之外交英雄松岡洋右、今日上午十時訪鈴木政友會總裁正式手交離黨聲明書、因與中島知久平（即中島飛機製造所長）及愛國同盟總務中野正剛合作、進行愛國運動失敗、定今日下午九時四十五分離開東京、退隱家鄉山口云、（八日路透社）</p>
<p>（東京）　松岡洋右之退出政友會、與政界以多大之衝動，尤以政友會曾以松岡氏爲招牌、標榜積極與自主外交、故精神上頗受損失、惟實質的結果難測、因此表面裝作冷靜、暗中則監視黨員之行動、（八日電通電）</p>

<h3>閩教縣長鄭貞文到滬縱談閩變新近情形　閩中教育行政五花八門　僞組織之籌欵辦新奇</h3>
<p>閩變發生後、所有福建省政府委員多數不願附逆、紛紛逃滬、惟省委兼教育廳長鄭貞文則久滯閩中、鄭前在滬任商務印書館編輯、爲閩省府改組時、由國府主席林森介紹人閩、至是外間頗多揣測之辭、兹悉鄭氏業於前（七日）偕同福建團務訓練所所長蕭叔宣（前任省防軍旅長、被十九路軍改編後、調斯職、現已辭職）由閩抵滬、日日社記者頃特趨謁鄭氏於私邸、卽詢閩省新近情形、承見告甚詳、亟錄之如下、</p>
<h3>本人遲遲離閩原因</h3>
<p>鄭氏首稱閩變發生、僞組織卽脅迫本人任民衆教育館館長、（未就）本人不願目睹毁黨叛國之行爲、極思早日去職脫離虎口、惟爲求教育界明瞭本人任内教育費以及整理閩省教育之經過一切情形計、不得不予最短期間内、留閩辦理此項手續、現己完竣、故於前日秘密離閩來滬、擬最近晋京、向中央報告一切、</p>
<h3>教育行政五花八門</h3>
<p>至目下之閩省教育行政五花八門、不堪聞問、當本人卸任之際、所有教育廳印信文卷、原由改組後之省府文化科（卽教育廳）接收、旋又被文化處委員會派人先期佔領、引起許多爭執糾紛、前教育廳長辦公館舍、亦爲文化委員會委員長所佔、現已接收旬餘日、而一切行政事項、毫未辦起、前日突由文化委員發出通令、中等以上學校校長曁應由該委員會改委、聞將安揷大批社民黨下級人員云、</p>
<h3>人民政府籌欵辦法</h3>
<p>談次鄭氏復提及僞組織之籌欵辦法新奇滑稽、盛傳閩方曾向日人借欵之說、屬於機密事件、本人不敢證實、惟僞組織以開辦經費無着、最近訓令公安局、勒迫全市不論商店住宅、每户應購買中華人民共和國國族一面、收費大洋二元、人民不得私製、達者嚴勵處罰、聞該旗幟每面製造成本僅四角、政府出賣國旗、每方可得一元六角之利益、所以計亦頗不資云云、</p>

<p>歡迎馬可尼專號</p>
<h3>歡迎馬可尼來華</h3>
<p>— 記者</p>
<p>無線電發明家威廉馬可尼（ＧuglielmoＭarconi）已於前日來滬，中國無線電同志聞此訊息，是多麽欣喜而熱烈歡迎呢？</p>
<p>馬可尼今已被共尊爲無線電發明家，雖在馬可尼之前研究無線電者尚有馬克斯威爾（Ｍaxwell）銳特（Ｒight）赫芝（Ｈertz）勃蘭來（Ｂranly）等惟祗有空恫的理論，而無眞實的試騐。至馬可尼出，乃獨秉其天才，將前人的理論，造成適用的器具。及一九０一年無線電横渡大西洋告成，遂爲世人所驚奇注意，互相研侒，其同改良，於是無線電乃日趨進步，射程遼逺，使用便利，於商用外，復可傳遞軍事上的消息，保護航海及航空的安全，將二十世紀電世紀轉變爲無線電世紀，馬可尼的大名，殆已傳播世界婦孺皆知了。</p>
<p>馬可尼第一次試騐的無線電機，甚爲簡陋，發報機的振盪器有一部分是用二個銅球製的，一接鋁製的電線，繫於放在天空中風筝線上作爲天線，一接銅線連於地中作地綫，收報機的檢波器則用金屬屑聚在玻璃管内的黏連器，開始播送。距離由半里，一里，九里，十二里而漸漸增逺。但仍埋首研究，逐步改良，未嘗以成功之大而鬆弛其進取的精神，利用自己所有的學識，相信自己潛在的能力，終身爲無線電事業服務，這足以使人欽敬不置的！</p>
<p>馬可尼試騐無線電的時候，經濟窘迫，他自己的政府不加援助，差不多使他失望，然他有不屈不撓的精神，愈挫愈奮的毅力，卒至於成。「世間惟大人物才能戰勝環境，」馬可尼的成功，眞可爲我國研究科學者的借鏡。</p>
<p>無線電事業落後的中國，比年以來，因政府的提倡，漸有萌芽發展氣象，我們希望發明家馬可尼氏此來，能指示我們南針。若更能作一二次公開演講，俾吾國民衆得共瞻發明家的風采，提高研究無線電的興趣，藉以促進中國無綫電事業的進步，這是我們在熱烈歡迎馬氏來華聲中所竭誠盼望的</p>

<h3>世界的發明家無線電界偉人馬可尼</h3>
<p>— 婁</p>
<p>馬可尼（Ｍarconi，Ｇuglieims），無線電發明者，於一八七四年四月二十五日生在意大利的布洛搿那（Ｂologna）他的父親是一個意大利的紳士，一八六四年與愛尼女士（ＭissＡnnieＪameson　)結婚。生了兩個兒子，馬可尼乃是幼者。</p>
<p>馬可尼在幼年讀書的時候，很喜歡研究物理學和電學。一八九五年，始專心研究電報學，其目的想利用電波來傳達電信。那一年的初夏，他在家裏做了許多實騐。這許多實騐所用的器具，雖都很簡陋，但他已得到一個結果：在一英里以上的距離間，可利用電波來互通消息。</p>
<p>他的最初的成功是利用高置的發報機和收報天線。經發電機及檢波器而接入地中的。他發明用一根環狀的電線，把一個火花間隙連接到一個埋在地中的金屬平面，便可增强電流的力量。他的收報機是用一靈敏的檢波器名爲Ｃoherer，連接於地下及高置的發報機。這樣的裝置，便能接到自他站發來的電信。同時，他又發明祗要天線裝置愈高，則通信的距離也可愈逺。</p>
<p>翌年，馬可尼到英國，在倫敦繼續他的研究。他把研究的結果，表演給英國的郵務官和其他政府機關的代表們看着。這種表演，最初是在倫敦郵政總局的屋頂上舉行的，其後，實騐的區域逐漸擴大，在相距九英里間的地方，也可利用電波來互通消息了。</p>
<p>一八九七年六月，馬可尼應意大利政府的邀請，前往斯班柴（Ｓpezir）那兒巳建立了一個無線電站，利用電波和距離十二英里以外的意大利戰艦互通消息。其後，他又被邀請到羅馬表演，在前意皇和皇后都出席欣賞他的試騐時，他又獲得了一次更進步的成功。</p>
<p>在那時候，大家都想把無線電應用到商業上來。一八九七年七月，在倫敦設立了一個公司，獲得馬可尼的特許，除意大利外，力向其他各國發展，這個公司起初呌做無線電報信號公司（ＷirelessＴelegraphＳignalＣoＬtd）。一九００年又改稱做馬可尼無線電報公司（ＭarconisＷireessＴelegraphＣoＬtd）。這個公司的努力發展和無線電進步是互有因果關係的。</p>
<p>無綫電最初應用於商業是在一八九八年。就在那一年，馬可尼被英國請去建立無線電工程，俾便維多利亞女皇（ＱueenＶictoia）和愛德華第七（ＥdwardＶii）互通音信。同年，無線電又被使用爲航舶和陸地間的通信工具，但船舶和陸地的距離不過十二英里。</p>
<p>在這一個時期中，馬可尼仍孜孜不倦地研究和改良着，故無線電的進步，日有增加。到一九００年，在相距二百英里間，他可利用牠來互通消息。一九０一年，更有驚人的進步，那年十二月十二日，馬可尼的初次試騐，——在大西洋的兩岸，利用無線電來互通消息。——也成功了。此後，他又屢次試騐都有相當的成功。他才確信在任何距離間無線電可使用爲通信的工具。</p>
<p>一九０二年，馬可尼在旅行美洲的旅程中，白日裏接到七日英里以外發給他的電信，黑夜裏，接到二千英里以外發給他的電信。這一個發見，使他知道無綫電能傳達的距離，黑夜大於白日。</p>
<p>馬可尼並不以這些發見爲滿足，他仍繼續地研究和改良。一九一０年，他得郎特（Ｈ·Ｊ·Ｒound）的帮助，能在六千英里以外，利用無線電互通消息。一九一二年，他又發明一種新的通信方法。這種通信方法普通呌做ＴheＴimedＳlparkＳystom到一九一八年，他便用這種方法在英國和澳洲間互通音信。</p>
<p>世界大戰中，無線電固已應用於軍事通信。正在這個時候，馬可尼又發見電波的應用還有所不便，於是又專心研究改良方法，這便樹立了短波的發明的基礎。</p>
<p>一九一六年，他得富蘭克林（Ｆrankin）的帮助，專心研究。到一九二四年，他又發見三十米的短波，在白日中也能應用於任何距離間的通信，近年來他更進而研究超短波——幾乎同光綫的波長同樣的電波，也巳經達到相當的成功了。</p>
<p>馬可尼在科學上的建樹是很偉大的，舉世的學者莫不知道他的大名。他不僅努力於科學的研究又參加政治的活動。在歐洲大戰的時候，他曾在意大利的軍隊中服過務，並被意皇任爲巴黎和會的代表；一九三０年又做了法西斯黨的議員。現在他正週游各國，於本月七日到上海。</p>
<h3>馬可尼氏之初期發明及其對於無綫電界之貢獻</h3>
<p>— 黄鑑村</p>
<p>美國愛迪生氏對於科學界的貢獻，其令譽遍佈全球，人莫不知其偉大；而意大利馬可尼氏對於無綫電界之偉大的貢獻，知之者反不若知愛迪生氏者之衆。須知馬氏之偉大正不亞於愛氏。兹乘馬氏之光臨，特將其對於無綫電界之貢獻，略爲介紹於次。</p>
<p>在馬氏未聞名之前，無線電的學說早己有了相當的基礎。即於一八六五年數學大家馬克思威爾氏（ＳamesＣlerkＭaxwell）發表了所謂「光的電磁說」，斷言由振盪的放電可發射電磁波於空間，其性質與光波相似。其後於一八八七年赫芝氏（Ｈertz）對於電磁波的存在，實地試騐，證明「光的電磁說」之正確無誤。這種發現啓發了馬可尼氏對於無線電之發明。馬氏對於無線電的探討是從十八歳時開始的，到了一八九五年方發明了無線電機械，這是無線電史上頗可紀念的。馬氏當時所發明的無線電機，在今日的眼光看來，雖極幼稚，然而在當時是一鳴驚人的寳物，其構造如次圖所示。即如（Ａ）圖，將赫芝振盪器之一端埋於地下，他端高懸於空中，前者俗稱接地，後者稱天綫。天線與接地間有一火花間隙Ｇ，如供給高電壓於自感量線圈Ｉ，則發生火花放電，於是在天線與接地間之電路（俗稱天減幅振盪，是爲發報裝置。如欲發出電報符號，則在自感量線圈之初級電路須揷入一電鍵Ｋ。當電鍵被下時，電流則由電池Ｂ流出，而使自感量線圈動作。此時因電鍵開關無恒，而使在初級線圈所流通之直流斷續不定，於是在次級線圈引起高壓，便Ｇ發生火花放電，在天線電路引起振盪，卒由天線將電波發射於空間。馬可尼氏最初所用之天線，如將</p>
<p>馬可尼夫婦在地中海船上以最新式短波機向美國通話</p>
<p>三十纒立方之洋鐵罐高懸於二十一米突高時，則能作距離三十米突之通信，如將洋鐵罐高懸至四十二米突高時，則能作九十米突距離之通信，如更將洋鐵罐之高度增加時，則能作二千四百米突距離之通信云。馬氏在其收報裝置（如Ｂ圖所示）亦利用天線Ａ與接地Ｅ，在兩者之間揷入凝屑器Ｃ（Ｃoherer），Ｃ之兩端連接有阻流圈ＣＣ，電池Ｂ及繼電器Ｒ（Ｒelay）。在繼電器電路中揷入電Ｂ２及莫爾斯墨水記錄器。在平常，Ｂr，ＣＣ，Ｃ，Ｒ之電路中因凝屑器之耗阻過大，故電流不能流通。但如有電波感觸於天線時，則天線電路有振盪電流通過，因此凝屑器之耗阻必爲之減少，故Ｂ，ＣＣ，ＣＲ之電路有電流通過，而使繼電器働作。繼電器一作用，則Ｂ２Ｍ之電路爲所關閉，電流遂能流通，終在莫爾斯墨水記錄器上現出所接收之信號。是爲馬氏當初所發明無線電機之梗概。當時每分鐘僅可收十字以至十五字而己。該機發明後之翌年，馬氏則携之渡英，得當時郵政總局總工程師部里斯氏之援助，逐漸從事於裝置之改良，遂於一八九八年作十八基羅米突距離之通信而成功。然馬氏之雄心未已，終於一九０一年横渡大西洋完成其二千英里之長距離通信，其對於無線電界之貢獻，如此之偉大，馬氏之令名，可傳千古矣。</p>
<h3>馬可尼與超短波</h3>
<p>— 明襄</p>
<p>超短波（ＵitraＳhortＷave）無線電通訊的發明，雖僅有三四年的歷史，但一般無線電工程師以及業餘研究家，都趨之若鶩，一致認爲最有興趣亦最有希望的試騐，實足使無線電史上，另創一新紀元。試騐最有成效者，當推無線電發明鼻祖－馬可尼先生。</p>
<p>超短波的範甲，大約指３００００Ｋ·Ｃ·以上的電波，其性質幾與光波相近似，一切特性，與通常的短波，有許多顯著不同之點，現在試騐期間，尚不能達逺距離通訊，但觀於馬氏的成就，己屬可驚了。</p>
<p>一九０一年馬氏完成其横跨大西洋短波通信時，收發距離達３０００哩以上，但當時的科學家，事前曾以精密高深的數學公式，證明此項通信的距離，最逺不能超過１６０哩，而馬氏竟打破此理論上的限度，故彼嘗謂「無論何事，勿顧其可能與否，均須試騐之，」最近馬氏之試騐超短波，何嘗不與當時情形一樣，以其毅力，自有今日之成功。</p>
<p>馬氏試騐超短波的最大動機，由於歐戰時，無線電應用於軍事上極廣，然軍事通信，首貴秘密，而無線電發射，漫無限制，於是引起馬氏，注意到無線電發射的方向問題，發覺方向性實爲超短波僅有的特點，在１９１９－２４年期間，馬氏嘗以十米突至六米突的電波試騐，成效大著。</p>
<p>馬氏謂「超短波的方向特性最爲珍貴，且極敏銳，至於收發的機件設備，更是簡單，無需强大電力裝置，並可不受雲霧的影響，天電的騷擾。」</p>
<p>一九三二年十二月二日，馬氏在皇家學會（ＲoyalＩnstitute）宣言其試騐超短波無線電通信之成功，因方完成靠近羅馬之ＲoccadiＰapa與ＣapeＦigariＳadinia兩處間之通信，其距離達１６８哩（較諸此時理論上所能達到的限度，已超出一百哩。）而更逺的通信，亦己有把握，通信的波長，巳創２２吋（不到一米突）的新紀錄，此種事實，在當時學理上認爲不可能者，馬氏竟能之。</p>
<p>超短波的應用於廣播無線電，亦經馬氏於不列顚廣播公司（Ｂ·Ｂ·Ｃ·）之倫敦總部内，建設一超短波廣播發射機，波長爲七·七五米突，現正由馬可尼公司工程師與廣播公司共同實騐中。</p>
<p>馬氏深信超短波亦可應用於無線電傳影（Ｔeievision），波長範圍，約在二米突與四米突之間。</p>
<p>並謂「此種超短波，現已可使之變成光的訊號，以作長距離通信之用，如沿海岸的各信號站間，或邊疆上各城堡間之通信。」</p>
<p>最近八月八日，意大利ＳantaＭargueriteＬigura與ＲoccadiＰapa兩地間，已試用馬氏最新發明的超短波無線電話，機件極爲靈便，可置之袋中，隨身携帶，免去現在電話機複雜的接線，試騐的成績，己可達一百英哩，清晰異常，將來成功普及後，請諸君享用吧！</p>
<h3>從馬可尼來華談到中國無綫電家</h3>
<p>— 微言</p>
<p>意大利無線電發明家馬可尼氏，（ＭarchessＧugliemoＭarconi）週游各國，於本月六日由北平來京，當晚乘夜車赴上海。關於馬氏行蹤及生平事蹟，多已陸續散見各報章雜誌，本文不再贅述。現在僅就個人對於馬氏來華後之感想，略述一二於左：</p>
<p>在中國，從事研究無線電的人，其數目雖無確實的統計，但是根據歷年來輸入各種無線電材料銷路暢旺的情形看起來，可知也並不在少數。不過旣有許多人在研究着，爲什麽却很少聽到他們對於無線電學術，有什麽新的發明或是什麽新的貢獻？固然，歷年來天災人禍，内憂外患，都足以阻碍一切事業的發展，但是我以爲最大的原因，是在於一輩研究無線電的人，没有認清他們本身應走的路程和應有的努力。</p>
<p>我們知道無線電最近十年來的進步，差不多全是得力於一輩業餘無線電家</p>
<p>本館贈送馬可尼勳爵之禮物</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>（ＲadioＡmateur）的努力。中國各地所有的業餘家，也不在少數，（據說單是上海一埠，裝置收音機的巳有三十萬人，假定裏面百分之一是業餘家而不是純粹的享樂家，那麽，爲數巳有三千。）何以却始終總是無聲無臭。原來中國的業餘家有一大半是行而不知的。他們日常所從事的實騐工作，祗會依照範本刻板去做，成功是他們的僥倖，失敗却又莫明其妙。肯隨時瀏覽各種報章雜誌的，巳是鳳毛麟角。至於研侒而有什麽心得的，那就更是絶無而僅有。這樣暗中摸索依樣畫葫蘆地去研究科學，結果徒然增加一筆漏巵而已！</p>
<p>有專門研侒的，也未嘗没有。譬如每次放洋的留學生中，就有不少是專攻無線電的。但因爲他們回國以後，祗肯在書本上或是粉筆中用功夫，把日常所有應做的實騐工作，差不多完全丢了。平時便輕易不肯踏進實騐室去。「知而不行」，結果也正與一輩「行而不知」的業餘家同。</p>
<p>從來科學家的成功，决没有「行而不知」或是「知而不行」便能完成的。過去的如發明怪傑愛迭生，他在做賣報童子的時候，對於有關電氣的書籍，便幾於無一不閱。成年後以迄老死，又幾於無一日不在實騐室中過生活。他如牛頓，達爾文，湯姆生以及愛因斯坦等，那一個能單靠幾本教科書或是胡亂試騐，便能完成他們的事業。所以我以爲要想在科學上有所發明，必須理論與實騐並重——換句話就必須「知行合作」纔能達到目的。</p>
<p>因爲一時的感觸，便不知不覺地就說了這麽許多廢話。希望這次馬可尼來華後，國内研究無線電的同志們——業餘家和非業餘家，鑒於外國科學家所以能成功的緣故，自己能懲前毖後，認清目標，在手與腦二方面，同時努力做去。這樣，纔能避免落伍，纔能有所成就，纔能不辜負這位大發明家來華的盛意最後敬祝這位爲人羣謀福利的馬可尼先生，旅途平安！</p>
<h3>上海之馬可尼無綫電機製造廠</h3>
<p>— 卿雲</p>
<p>「馬可尼中國」，（Ｍarconi-Ｃhina）這名稱是何等偉大啊！馬可尼的發明將何所止境，中國未的一切將如何情形，是没有人能夠料想的。無線電正像一個幼年的英雄，中國彷彿是將醒的睡獅，在世界注目中，「中國馬可尼」廠，或名中國無線電報公司－之組織，實含有重要的意義。</p>
<p>歐戰時代，我國以參戰關係，己感無線電事業之重要，故與倫敦馬可尼無線電公司合作，經營在華關於無綫電之種種企業，創立製造廠，近年我國無綫電事業之發達，該廠實與有力焉。</p>
<p>馬可尼無線電製造廠試騐船舶用發報機</p>
<p>廠設本埠韜朋路七五九號，其配用於陸，海，空的種種器件，先經縝密的審核，至於發報收報及放大用所有另件，則均經一萬弗打之試騐，方才使用。木及鋼之模型，均在特定計畫中儲藏之，粗細電纜，概細心構造，决不致因電力之升降而生妨碍。廠基占地十畝，都爲己有，若於後從事擴充，亦屬易事。樣子間設北京路二號，聘有專家，爲各界服務，簡便收信機之製造，大力發報機之裝置，以及大陸通信等，均可供應。　　「馬可尼警號臺」早爲上海附近航程上危險時之救援者，現在海岸各口海盜之防禦，私貨輸運之取締，又均受無綫電之控制。而所用者即爲馬可尼之機械，上海公共租界警務上之無綫電交通器具，亦全爲馬可尼之裝置。最近政府且與倫敦馬可尼無線電公司聯絡收發英美電報，此則更足以便利東西之通信矣。</p>
<p>逺東地面廣大，有待無綫電之接續可無待言，若華英合組之該廠，能以固有之成功，再加强力擴張。則將來之發達，殊未可限量也。</p>

<h3>由無線電發現天電</h3>
<p>— 雷微</p>
<p>美國東部新澤稷州荷爾姆代有一無線電名家卡爾傑斯凱（ＫarlＪansky）者，最近一年來，由無線電機的收音中突然發現一奇怪的現象，經過了一年的研究，己證明這種收音機中收到的聲浪是宇宙間天河中所發生的天電。這一件發現，是最近無線電界中認爲最奇特而最值得注意的一件事。</p>
<p>卡爾傑斯凱用一效力强大的收音機，裝置一天線，這條天線與宇宙的中心成　一直角形，就是偏向於地球之外，當拿這天線的頭端，向南的時候，在收音機中聽到很清晰的潺潺之聲，好像山谷中的流水，這種聲音好像有一定的規律，並不有别的雜聲相擾，於是引起了卡爾的好奇心而加以研究。</p>
<p>他從長波機換上中波及短波機，每換一種收音機時，能發現許多聲浪，研究的結果，斷定這種聲浪是天空中的天電，然後又繼續研侒，才測定這種電浪在最强時候的波長，有十四·六米突之長，而這種電浪是從地球之南方來的，斷定爲天空中的星河中所發出，有强烈的磁力感應，這種雖爲臆說，但己有許多電學專家共同研侒而斷定爲天空中向地球襲擊的一種電力，這種電力就是以前在無線電學中的Ｐoworlioe。</p>
<p>這種天電的力量極强大，電源和地球的距離有四千光年（Ｌightyear即一年間光所行走之距離），在天空中，如果用聲逺鏡向天電所發生的來源處窺視，有許多的灰沙和氣體遮掩着，所以不能很明白的看見，祗見一層薄薄的白光而已，其中有幾百萬數量的星，星和星之間因爲有一種吸力的樞紐，這個吸力的樞鈕成功一種互相感應的力量，好像幾百萬的大線圈，彼此感應而產生一種强大的天電，那就是現在卡爾氏在收音機中所收到的電浪了。</p>
<p>由一年的繼續研究，發現這種天電的中心因爲過於巨大而不易更變，雖地球繞太陽而行，有六００·０００·０００英里的周圍，然而電浪方向没有更變，於此可知這種天電電力的巨大和影響的一般了。</p>
<p>至於其他許多的問題，天電的力量能夠使地球上發生怎樣的變動，尚在研究之中，現在所知道的，就是這天電佈滿了宇宙，使地球上的空氣分子發生離子，而所謂以太（Ａether）即從這中間而生，這又是無線電上重要的臆說。</p>
<h3>内外消息</h3>
<p>袖珍式無綫電機出現　袖珍式無綫電機巴由美國密支根的恩挨勃國際無綫電公司製造ＡnnＡrborＩnternationalＲadoＣooperationＵ·Ｓ·Ａ·）全機重祇兩磅，面積爲６“Ｘ４１／２”，</p>
<p>大如明信片式的摺疊鏡箱，機内有眞空管二只，據該公司謂此管足抵平常五管的效力，電源可由直流或交流電供給，機内尚有三吋的小擴聲器。</p>
<p>該機綫路由威福爾氏（ＲobertＷuerfel）設計，謂廣播訊號經第一管後可增强三倍，足够</p>
<p>够放大，第二管司電力輸出與整流兩作用，調節音量用一滑桿移動之，選聽訊號及音樂可轉動一喜形刻度盤，配諧電容器由兩錫片製成，使開合的角度變動而增减其容量云。</p>
<p>— 一知</p>
<p>帮助殺人的擴聲器　無綫電可以帮助文化的向上，同時又可以帮助殺人。大規模的就是利用無綫電來控制無人駕駛的飛機，坦克車，軍艦，水雷等，在戰塲大施其殺人的手段，這些可怕的殺人的無綫電機，各國都爭先恐後的盡其發明的能事，在最近的未來大戰，我們必能目覩的。</p>
<p>至於擴聲器是可以發出優美的音樂來供人娛樂的，牠能帮助殺人，誰都不敢相信，但是這是的確的消息。殺人事件是在法國發生的。據殺人犯的自供說：當他要加害於死者的時候，恐怕事情洩漏，有礙於施殺，因室内有收音機擴聲器，當時就利用擴聲器，接收廣播音樂，在優美音樂的演奏中，在響亮的雜音中，殺了死者，因此當時就遮蔽了室外人的耳目不曾洩漏了出來。</p>
<p>— 鑑村</p>
<p>可驚的空電强力，無綫電的種種問題中最難解决的就是空電的干擾（註：超短波不受空電的干擾所影響，當然不成問題），其干擾之大者，足以阻礙廣播收音。根據最近美國電報電話公司的調查技師Ｗhites氏之發表，謂「空電之大者，其電壓有十萬伏脫，其電流有二十萬安倍，若以之換算爲電力，則有二百萬萬華脫，卽二千萬基羅華脫」云，空電的偉力，可想而知。</p>

<h3>糧食現洋麥不斷兜售期粉麥一致低落</h3>
<p>粉市上午開盤後、各月份市面、呈先漲後跌之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥續好二三角、坎拿大好一角左右、故開價後、各月份市面、均帶俏一分外、惟至二盤後、則市面又忽下落、因傳現洋麥之兜售不絶、并以滙率之故、喊價奇廉、聞本埠某廠又成交阿根庭麥一船、價廉至三元九角半、美國白麥亦廉至四元零五分、致三四五月份、一致狂瀉、尤以四五月份爲更甚、較初開竟跌四五分之巨、迫至下午開盤、各月份趨勢雖仍不佳、但尚平和、近因天津報價仍弱、逺期則小廠微有出檔、市况軟弱不堪、票洋麥如是濫兜、逺其局面難免變動也、結果本月份較前日跌二分七厘半、一二月份跌二分七厘半、三月份跌三分二厘半、四月份跌三分半、五月份跌三分七厘半、</p>
<p>麥市上下午開盤後、各月份市面、大致呈平疲不振之態、當上午初開時、因洋麥報價、回漲一三角及一角左右、故初開時、市面尚見平定、迨後因粉市轉軟、并以洋麥之兜售不絶、人心遂又一致看軟、各月份成交雖未甚暢、價則跌三五分不等、迨至下午開盤、趨勢仍然平均、惟盤旋之中、微呈定局、因洋麥之套頭、尚少發生也、結果本月份較前日小一分、一月份小三分、二月份小四分、三月份小二分、餘無出入、現麥市面、仍然穩俏、開山東麥四元三角七分、瑶灣麥四元三角、揚州麥四元二角、東台麥四元二角、通州麥四元一角七分、五河麥四元一角半、安定麥四元零二分、蕪湖麥四元、由華豐去二千包、信大去五百包、</p>

<p>昨日客秈市况、經前日本街囤買問津、人心向上、囤户繼續問津、又引起客帮之辦裝、查閩省當地需要甚亟、祇回事變後需要呆阻、船運不便、致未能如願暢辦、惟近日來商業上己經恢復舊狀、福州帮辦胃漸次活動、前經本街囤户暢辦後、福州辦與又活、泉州亦有續辦、市乃繼續步砌、比之前日市價較漲五分至一角不等、統市由本街囤户等辦去湖南機油米一千包、價七元一角、又機晚三百包、價七元五角八分、無錫機元米五百包、價八元四角至八元、蕪湖機元米由寗波辦去三百包、價七元六角七分至七元四角、福州辦去湖南糙油米三百二十六包、價六元一角、糙靖一百七十七包、價五元八角、糙紅米一百七十三包、價五元七角四分、本街與泉州合辦機靖二百八十五包、價七元二角、次六元六角、</p>

<h3>南北貨厦桔餅銷滯轉跌</h3>
<p>厦門桔餅近無續到、查前存號貨、數亦不多、惟貨品不甚軟熟、色尚佳、除零星稍有銷胃外、竟乏整批交易、因此市象甚疲、昨聞暗盤略有成交、較之前盤跌去二元許云、</p>
<h3>五金東白鐵紛紛跌價</h3>
<p>東白鐵自到貨踴躍後、市上存貨十分充斥、客帮若寗波等埠因反日會嚴重調查、均不敢裝貨而長江路一帶客帮、亦無買賣、市上交易奇少、一般利令智昏之同業、以走銷不旺、大起恐慌、致行情紛紛跌落、如七尺成本要一元二角一二分、而市上實際開出祗能估一元一角五分、六尺成本要一元、而估出祇九角六七分、因此虧本者屢屢、其他若法西釘新鉛絲水門汀等東貨、均絡繹來申、所以行情一節、多趨鬆動、</p>

<h3>從撲滅蒼蠅說起</h3>
<p>— 傳翼之</p>
<p>鐵絲網和篾條製成的「蒼蠅拍」，竟做了我唯一洩恨的兇器，它－蒼蠅想從玻窗中尋找它的出路，結果，這出路成了它的致命傷，身體己給它自己的血肉膠在玻璃窗上了，它們爲了覓食而向我的書面，桌上忙奔，結果，這書面，桌上，也做了它們爲生存而犧牲的刑塲，它們的同類爲了它們的受刑而來祭弔，或者，也爲了，自己覓食而誤走到這刑塲來，終於一個個成了我殺戮的對象，大有「尸横遍野，血流成渠」的樣子，我痛快到無以復加；但頃刻便又發覺我是個極殘暴的魔君，我受良心的驅使，把它們掃在一堆，想用紙包好給它們做個偉大的「京觀」。</p>
<p>然而，這畢竟是「貓兒哭耗子」的一片假心腸，古代不是有用人祭神嗎？中古也嘗以人殉葬，商紂好奇心發動了，便拿到比干來開刀，爲得要看聖人的七竅心，孟德夢中還好殺人，近聞某處土匪把「肉票」的雙脚綑在靠近竹林的樹樁上，就近拉灣大竹，縛在「肉票」的頸上，再用利刄披開他的頸胛間的皮肉，然後把竹彈轉，頭連氣管便很輕鬆的脫離肢體了；這是磔刑的遺法，也不有什麽希奇，「弑戮」，似乎是造物給予人類的本能，「是件肉的娛樂」；因爲人的生性是好「殺戮」的小孩子捉到小禽獸和小蟲豸，便要設法把他弄死：李逵幾天不殺人，便要感到頭痛「見舊劇」，殺死一羣媒介病菌的蒼蠅，眞的會和林黛玉惜花，葬花的那麽蠢？</p>
<p>記得法國小說家莫泊桑的「一個瘋子」中有這一段話：「相信大家要輕視那班預備開設」人類屠房的人們，實際呢？人家却把榮耀堆在他們的身上，他們胸前常常掛着什麽金光燦爛的榮譽牌子；還有人給他們什麽奬金，頭銜，和十字動章呢，他們背着器械往街上經過，紳士們都用羨慕的眼光去注意，因爲他們是流灑人血的使者呵？」（大意見李青崖譯文）的確，殺人愈多，地位和榮譽愈會增高，官爵，財寳，勳旗，都可不期而至，所以各資本帝國主義國的軍人，纔會磨拳擦掌，準備第二次世界大戰；或者，纔有關起門來自家厮殺的一個國家；反戰會，什麽大同盟，簡直是夢想！</p>
<p>我没有庖丁那般批却導竅的本領去殺個把人，只好拿到蒼蠅當作一件摧殘生命的娛樂；我有想做足不履蟲豸的仁獸，只怪蒼蠅自己没有自衛和反抗的能力呵，是不是呢？</p>

<h3>冬之漫話</h3>
<p>— 賢賢</p>
<p>秋去科來，「冬季大廉價」的市招，巳掛滿了各街各巷，毛冷的絨線的東西，巳塞滿了百貨商店的櫉窗，全狐四圍住了女人的粉頸，呢大衣包裏着每一個摩登男女，形成了一個個肉瘤，－－天氣果然冷了，温度己降到了四十度左右。</p>
<p>在冬季裏，樹葉都脫落了，一切小動物，凍死的凍死，冬眠的冬眠，就是太陽光，也顯示着淡黄的色彩，甚麽都表示着萎縮的態度。但是也有例外的，在舞場裏，大家都儘着汗流浹背，而跴開了大步飛奔的洋車夫，也儘會迎着西北風，熱汗直流。有人說，這便呌做「冬天裏的春天」。</p>
<p>冬天，自然是家有摩登妻子的丈夫，負擔最重的一個季節。因爲冬季衣服，要供給得使妻子不呼冷號寒，便不是容易的一回事。再以每一襲冬裝的代價而論，往往可抵得幾襲春夏秋裝。而且又迫近年關，更難應付。此外，還得預備下一筆凍瘃藥膏費，以備醫治絲襪裏的六寸膚圓上的凍瘃。所以一般人都說「熱天好過，冬季難挨」，原來如此。</p>
<p>但是也有人愛「冬」的，據說，冬季裏窩「熱被窩」，也是人生一樂。理由是，一不受臭虫騷擾，二不受蚊子威脅，儘着窗外的西北風，進攻得一切靜物哀呼慘呌，可是熱被窩裏，却儘着温暖如春。若是春宵一刻，可值千金的話，那麽冬季裏的熱被窩，時值估價，便該不折不扣的值到萬金。而更其是有粉臉婆，黄臉婆，同衾共枕者。</p>
<p>温度己降到了四十度左右，無疑地，「冬」己降臨了。烘熱水汀，喝白蘭地，擁姨太太，蓋全山毯的大老官，自然滿不在乎，但是就砒酒都喝不到一蛊，破棉襖都没有一件，以弄口爲逆旅的流浪者，一樣的會得挨過這一個冰天雪地。那麽，我們又何必對「冬」謳歌，或是咒詛呢。</p>
<p>不用歡喜，也不用躭憂，大家凖備着過冬罷。——「冬」，不過這麽短短的一個時期。</p>

<p>第二十回　卜吉有期老人連日笑　剷愁不盡舊雨對門居</p>
<p>趙桂枝靠在枕上，臉上兀自帶着淚痕，母親和他一說話，他忽然之間，又露着牙齒笑了。江氏這倒有些納悶，究竟是傷心呢，還是高興呢？怎麽半哭半笑的躺着呢？他坐在坑對面一張椅子上，望了桂枝的臉，只管出神。桂枝道；你誰着我幹什麽？我臉上今天没有多長一塊肉。江氏道：你睢着罷，你一會子哭，一會子笑，這一會子好像又有些生氣，我眞摸不着，你這是爲了什麽原因。桂枝道：你瞧，好好的一個人，又不燒，又不冷，身體發軟，生起病來，心裏怎樣不煩惱。可是想起我這樣大的人，還忍不住生病，所以我又笑了。江氏道：你可病不得，說話喜期也就到了，自强要回家來完婚了，裏裏外外，全忙着我一個人，我可有些忙不過來呢。桂枝的思想，雖然維新了許多，可是提到自己出閣的事，自己若是大張旗鼓的說着，那究竟有些不好意思。順手一掏，在枕頭下面，掏出了一本連環圖畫的小說，兩手展開來，低了面孔看着。江氏看他那情形，雖不作聲，却是很願意知道自强的行期，便道：我的意思，倒不拘定什麽日期。可是自强寫信回來，總是有些不過意的樣子，倒是願意把喜事辦完了。他那意思，若是他在喜峯口駐防日子長着的話，打算把家眷也接了去。我想口外的日子，怎樣也不如我鄉好。再說那裏又是駐兵的地方。桂枝就搶着道：那要什麽緊？生長在口外的人，那别過日子了。我現在倒願掉換一個地方住住，換個新鮮口味。江氏道：我們作上人的，有什麽話說，隨方就緣，到那裏也可以住家。</p>

<h3>談結婚</h3>
<p>— 郁達夫</p>
<p>前些日子，林語堂先生似乎曾說過女子的唯一事業，是在結婚。現在一位法國大文豪來滬，對去訪問他的新聞記者的談話之中，又似乎說，男子欲成事業，應該不要結婚。</p>
<p>華盛頓，歐而文是一個獨身的男子，但見聞短記裏的一篇歌頌妻子的文章，却寫得那麽的優美可愛。同樣查而斯，蘭姆也是個獨身的男子，而愛麗亞的「獨身者的不平」一篇，又冷嘲熱諷，將結婚的男女和婚後必然的果子——小孩們——等，俏皮到了那一步田地。</p>
<p>究竟是結婚的好呢，還是不結婚的好？這問題似乎同先有鷄呢還是先有鷄蛋一樣，常常有人提起，而也常常没有人解决過的問題。照大體看來，想租房子的時候，是無眷莫問的，想做官的時候，又是朝裏無裙莫做官的，想寫文章的時候，是獨身者不能寫我的妻的，凡此種種似乎都是結婚的好。可是要想結婚，第一要有錢，第二要有閑，第三要有職，這潘驢……的五個條件，却也很不容易辦到。更何况結婚之後，「兒子自己要求」，在這世界人口過剩，經濟恐慌，教育破產，世風不古的時候，萬一不愼，同蘭姆所說的一樣，兒子們去上了斷頭臺，那眞是連祖宗三代的楣都要倒盡，那裏還有什麽官人請！娘子請！的唱隨之樂可說呢？</p>
<p>左思右想，總覺得結婚也不好，不結婚也不好的。中庸之道，若在男女婚姻上能適用的話，我倒很想把某先生駁覆林先生的話再來加以吟味，先將同胞們都化成了像魏忠賢一樣的中性者來試試看如何？</p>
<h3>俄法揷畫展覽會</h3>
<p>— 須白石</p>
<p>由於一向對木刻的心好，托星期日的福，下午跑到老靶子路去看了一個小小的展覽會。上海的展覽會空氣是給什麽「師輩」之類開濫了，吹呀吹擂呀擂的，使人頭昏眼花，不能忍受。因此，說句慚愧話，我雖然也是個「藝徒」，却不想多看時下的展覽會的。但今天是例外了，例外的原因一半由於木刻的偏好，一半也由於我頗能信任外國人，！在新興美術的一切成績上，我是願意竭誠拜倒，不避「洋奴」之諱的。</p>
<p>地點是老靶子路青年會。經過一段「紳士之街」（北四川路），轉一灣，到了那地方。房子很小，而且灰色，逺没有八仙橋青年會那麽趾高氣揚。進門，一眼看見一塊日文字母的木牌，這才知道原來是日本人的青年會。</p>
<p>是二層樓上兩間小室。展覽品四十件。起先我本聽說是木刻展覽會，一看目錄，才知是「俄法書籍揷畫展覽會」。其中木刻也有十八幅，却並不是單行的木刻，而是作爲書籍揷圖的木刻。</p>
<p>所謂揷畫，大半是素描，一部分印着簡單的三色或二色，另一部分是圖案式。那些素描是好的。說到書籍的揷畫，總與書籍内容相關聯；往往有許多揷畫放在書裏極有意趣，拿出書外則全然無味，中國的揷畫大都如此，即活潑如豐子愷君的手筆也不能例外；（這在乎技衛修養的深淺，自不能深責任何人）。但這裏許多揷畫非特揷在書中非常合式，即拿出書外，也還能單獨地成爲畫的講到木刻，第一點令我奇異的，就是在校術上與我前此所見的大不相同。平常習見的木刻大都爽朗，粗魯，但這裏的都非常細膩。其中Ａleksoev所刻高爾基母親的揷畫，可說是最精細，寫實不過的東西。人物的輪廓，體積，逺近，都眞確的活現着，而又各有各的表情。粗看上去，彷彿他用着極尖細的鋼筆在黑紙上畫出各個物體的受光部分－暗部讓黑着！，筆致寥落，而堅實之感爽然。這種手法與麥綏萊勒等的完全不同，一邊常利用一些失實的誇張以顯露緊張，而這裏是細銳，眞實，而又堅强。</p>
<p>另一部Ｆodin城市與年的揷畫，筆致與母親相彷，而氣氛則又不同。這部裏，都刻着天氣的變象－雪，雲，暴風雨等。那表現力自然是充分的。尤其是暴風雨的景象，那種由鬱悶而至活放的空氣，是完全畢露着在。而各種物體被天氣變化了的景象如光暗，隂影……，也是一點也不曾遺漏忽略過。</p>
<p>這樣說起來也許太累贅吧。上面兩部是我認爲最好的；其餘還有五道河，愉快書室印度故事三部，比較次一點，但傾向都一律；非常寫實。</p>
<p>這裏是俄，法兩國的作品。被認爲木刻最發達的德國作品，没有。在量上，似很少，在質上，則純粹是精品。法國木刻祇八幅，餘均畫，唯美氣味甚重；俄則全是木刻，而旦却是現實的題材，於此可見兩國傾向之不同。</p>
<h3>小玩意</h3>
<p>— 青農</p>
<p>一天下午，好像人們憂愁得哭出來，樣的臉孔似地鉛色的天空飛動著深灰色的雲塊，街上商店的招帘被秋風吹得摇拂不定，我擠在人的潮與車的潮裏走到了東方巴黎的英大馬路。那天正是星期日，男人女人紳士小姐手裏提的拿的都是「大减價」商店裏頭買來的物品，又都在人行道上擠着，在「大减價」商店的門口湧着，上海的人們是這樣的喜歡購買物品。我受了這一種空氣傳染着，忽然心裏頭也想要買一兩件想了好久而没有買成的日用必需品，可是摸一摸口袋，錢不够，正在似乎一半羨慕人家嫉妒人家一半痛恨自己爲什麽没帶錢出來的時候，走過了大陸商場門口，遇著一個小癟三手裏拿着幾隻橡皮的馬兒狗兒的小玩意在呌賣，就想起要去看一個朋友無妨買一隻狗兒給她的寳寳玩。自己心裏有了動機，加添那小癟三殷懃地勸買，僅僅兩隻小洋就可以有一隻狗兒，爲什麽不化這小錢？買成了拿在手裏問他有紙頭包没有，没有，就拿在手頭罷。在路上走着，心裏十分快慰，望一望人們，心裏告訴他們，我也買了物品。可是，手上拿着那麽一隻不小的橡皮狗兒，拿牠的頭覺得不好，拿牠的脚覺得也不好，自己不覺侷促起來，好像路人的眼光都在批評我拿的姿勢不對，又好像都在批評我爲什麽手上拿了一隻小孩子玩的小玩意的橡皮狗兒。終於那橡皮狗兒在我的手上翻來覆去地拿着走。而我的心裏總是侷促不安。坐電車去吧？路那麽逺，狗兒拿在手上走路怪難爲情的。於是乎上了電車。在電車上，人們的眼光都望望我，奇怪！我的臉上自己覺得　了紅暈地有點熱意。</p>
<p>「東洋人！」旁邊一個穿藍布短打的工人模樣的人對他的朋友說，望了我一眼，輕視地。</p>
<p>東洋人？我？在去年上海打仗時曾經因爲容貌像東洋人而受辱的心嚇了一跳。趕緊向他說，「弗是格，阿拉弗是東洋人。」他冷笑了一聲，吸他的香烟。他的朋友亦是一個穿藍布短打的工人模樣的人，深切地望了我幾眼，摇着頭說，「弗是，廣東人。」得救了，他的朋友有眼力。</p>
<p>「東洋人講上海話就是格拿樣子，廠裏的拿馬温阿弗是格拿樣子怪腔怪調格？」</p>
<p>「廣東人講上海話也是和東洋人一樣格。」</p>
<p>「同拉是廣東人嘸没錯，上海話講相來！」我　乙向他證明。</p>
<p>他仔細地再望我一眼，半信半疑，忽然間望到了我手上那隻橡皮狗兒，</p>
<p>「你看，手上還是拿着東洋貨！」他的態度是由輕視到了鄙視的了！</p>
<p>東洋貨？我心裏着了慌，忙將手裏的橡皮狗兒查察了一遍，糟了，在狗腿上就有着英文字寫明着日本製造的字樣和商標！這回不待他的責難，我的臉上己經發熱得有如火在燒着，心頭也撲通撲通地跳。</p>
<p>一在大馬路買的，我不曉得牠是東洋貨！」自辯地說。</p>
<p>右手隔壁的人同情似地說，「馬路上賣東洋貨的頂多。」</p>
<p>我不敢再和那兩個工人說話，爲了遮掩自己的害羞和申明自己的理由，就和那說話的人談了關於我如何買了那橡皮狗的來由。</p>
<p>「兩角錢？陳嘉庚的才四角！」</p>
<p>那人似乎是一個店員，關於物價很内行似地這麽一說，我的臉上更慚愧地熱了一陣。</p>
<p>電車一到目的地，恨不得就從窗口跳下去。到了朋友的家。小朋友一見那小玩意的橡皮狗兒高興得張開着他的小嘴巴在學着「狗，狗」的喊，幾乎連飯都不想吃了。我雖然爲了這小玩意吃虧不少，可是小朋友一高興，也就覺得足以賠償我的損失了。</p>
<h3>客窗小記</h3>
<p>— 殊</p>
<p>十二</p>
<p>閒逛奮書肆，無意中購得黄本驥（虐疼）所編的「明尺牘墨華」增訂本三卷，此書所收，大都是明人的短牘，編者從各家墨蹟中抄出的。計上卷收聶大年等三十家，信五十九通；中卷收董其昌信九十三通；下卷收陳繼儒等二十一家，信七十三通，其間頗多不經見的佳作。編者論尺牘，亦到深到之語，我極愛其在序中所說的：</p>
<p>惟短柬片扎親手自書，或言國政，或言交情，或言家常瑣屑，極細極微之事，大抵皆倉卒濡毫，不假修飾，聊聊數語，流落人間，而其人品之醇駁，性情之邪正，往往於無意中流露而出。</p>
<p>而跋董其昌尺牘所云：「隨手拈來，不擇紙筆，其亂頭粗服，自饒意致，往往有書不盡筆，筆不盡意之妙」，尤能說到短牘的妙處。不過，後來的許多書信作者，却順有不同，雖有如此的短的手扎——漂亮的文章，然大都是模仿前人，没有内容的無靈魂之作。這樣，當然不能從尺牘中去認識作者，不過是古尺牘模擬之作與譯品而已，吾無取焉。</p>
<h3>兩兄弟（五三）</h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑著李維克譯</p>
<p>「不相干」，羅蘭老爺接着說，「不能夠因爲這個緣故便像野蠻人一樣溜走」。</p>
<p>陸太太想給這事做個轉圜，她說道：</p>
<p>「不對，不對，他是用英國式的禮貌走了的；人家有急事的時候是常常這樣從大庭廣衆之」</p>
<p>中溜走的」</p>
<p>「啊」！哲安回答，「在大庭廣衆之中，這是可能的，可是没有人以英國式的禮貌來對付自」</p>
<p>己的家族，而我的哥哥近來却專門斡着這一手」。</p>
<p>六</p>
<p>在一兩星期間，羅蘭家裏一切如常。父親釣着魚，哲安和母親兩人忙着籌備新店，筆爾則面色非常隂沉，祇在吃飯的時候見到他。</p>
<p>有天晚上他的父親問他道：</p>
<p>「見了什麽鬼，你一直對我們哭喪着臉？這事我並不是今天才看出來的」。</p>
<p>醫生回答：</p>
<p>「這是因爲我痛感着生活的重荷的緣故」。</p>
<p>這老實人兒一點也不懂得這話的意思，他現着憂愁的臉色說道：</p>
<p>「眞的這太厲害了。自從我們有運氣得到這筆遺產後，大家都像不幸似的。這竟像是我們遭着了什麽意外，竟像是我們哭着什麽人似的」！</p>
<p>「我確是在哭着一個人呢」，筆爾說。</p>
<p>「你嗎，哭着誰呢」？</p>
<p>「啊！」個你所不認識的，而是我所痛愛着的人。</p>
<p>羅蘭老爹以爲這是一宗闢於愛情的勾當，這是指的一個和他的兒子有來往的輕薄女人，他問道：</p>
<p>「這一定是一個女人啦」？</p>
<p>「對啦，是一個女人」。</p>
<p>「死了嗎」？</p>
<p>「不，比死還壞，她失身了」。</p>
<p>「啊」！</p>
<p>老頭兒聽見他兒子以一種奇怪的語調，當着他女人的面，說出這番出人意外的隱事，雖也覺得奇怪，但他以爲這類事與第三人無關，也就不再追問下去了。</p>
<p>羅蘭媽媽好像毫没有聽到似的；她臉色慘白，像是病了。她丈夫早己好幾次出乎意外地看見她坐下時像倒下在椅子上一樣，聽見她喘息着像再也不能呼吸了一樣，這時對她說道：</p>
<p>「眞的，路易兹，你的臉以很壞，你一定是給哲安預備新居累得太厲害了！你也稍爲休息一下罷！這東西現在旣然有錢了，也並不急急於此呢。」</p>
<p>她摇摇頭没有回答。</p>
<p>她今天臉色白得那樣厲害，所以羅蘭重又注意着了。</p>
<p>「哎，這不行，你應當調治才對。」他說。</p>

<h3>戴院長的幽默</h3>
<p>— 韋拔</p>
<p>在本月三日本報「考試院舉行授證典禮」的大字標題之下，看到一節小小的新聞，頗有吃橄欖一樣的滋味，爰本「奇文共欣賞」主義，將原文照錄如下：中央社二日南京電，考試院二日舉行授給二届高考及格人員證書典禮時，行禮秩序中之靜默三分鐘，贊禮者在數秒鐘時，即呼默畢，戴傳賢大怒，事後將贊禮人員記過，並自呈請國府，予以記過處問。</p>
<p>初讀此文，覺頗有「論語派」的作風，疑出自林語老的手筆。再讀則固赫然南京專電也。三讀而深歎戴院長篤敬之忱，巨細不遺，贊禮者的玩忽之罪，記過處分，眞是咎有應得。</p>
<p>易曰：「履霜而堅冰至。」君子以爲是見微而知著的表徵。我們戴院長年來雖然潛心佛學，却亦深通於易。因爲倘「三分」而可縮做「數秒」，則「三民」亦可縮爲「一民」了。對總理遺像而說謊，這簡直是有點尋開心。詎不大背「夙夜匪懈」與「必信必忠」的宗旨。此而不怒，更待何時！於是戴院長雖修養功深，亦不能不破五戒六戒，而將贊禮人員「記過」了。祇是「自請處分」一節，未免是代人受過，這或者也是一種負責的表示，亦以見大政治家的一種不苟精神，可作後生楷模的。</p>
<p>但年來「失敬」之事，似乎並不止此一樁。時間固有鐘錶可查，政治亦不無「古本」可對證也。然而戴院長不怒於前，不怒於後，不怒於左，不怒於右，面恰恰怒在一個無名無姓的贊禮人員的身上，是何故與？說者謂這是戴院長的「幽默」，然而如此我便不能不爲該贊禮者呌一聲「屈」了！</p>
<h3>還是先醫自己的心腸呀</h3>
<p>— 敬安</p>
<p>機器用壞了要技師來修整，人身患了病也要醫生來療治，所以醫生和人類發生了極密切的關係。醫生若是好的可做人類的救命星，醫生若是壞的反做了殺人的劊子手。所謂好的又有兩項必不可少的條件，那就是醫術和醫德。有了精深的醫術，又要有良好的醫德才能夠眞正爲人類謀幸福，爲國民保健康。現下的醫生精　醫術的較多，至若醫德好的雖不少，但是壞的奸滑的欺騙人的總居多數。病人如果碰到醫德好的醫生，自然有生機；不然，那就要遭醫生的欺騙，甚至於遭醫生的殘殺！因爲許多醫生診金定得高原，病人若出不到此種診金就不給他看症，或遷延時日，或糊塗了事。患病的人痛苦萬分，甚至於命危旦夕，怎可遷延？怎可糊塗？又遷延，又糊塗，一定要結果人家的性命，像上海的醫生最是架子十足的，例如門診是一元或二元，出診就要十元二十元，夜間或逺途加倍。還有更無人道的惡例，就是經過一個租界要加收一倍診金，如原定公共租界要十元的，請到法租界就要三十元，若又在夜間再加一倍，則一副棺材本都要交給他了！請來看了又不一定就醫得好，所以家堍不好的，還是保着棺材本好！</p>
<p>不過在另一方面看來，却又不見得一定就醫生的不是；因爲病人的心理往往以爲貴族式的醫生，診金藥費很重的，一定可以藥到回春；醫藥費低廉的，他總視若殺人的砒霜。這樣的人列世上很常見，我從前在某刋物上看見一位醫生說：「有一個患花柳病的人，請一位甚狠毒醫生注射六零六花了二十塊錢：後來病還没有好，醫生又因事跑到旁的地方去了，就請過别一個醫生來注射，這位醫生忠厚一點，祇算他五塊錢，病者反驚駭不置，何以價錢差得這樣逺？於是懷疑到他的是假貨，雖經醫生再三解釋都不相信，一定要找過二十元一針的六零六，結果錢雖花了病又還一樣」像這樣的病者心理上多麽錯誤呢？對忠厚的醫生，懷疑他賣假藥，對狠毒的醫生，反認到他賣仙丹，這不是認賊作父嗎？由此觀之，醫生的醫德已不好，病人的心理又錯誤，才弄到世上的人纏擾在病魔手中。但深想起來，究竟是醫生先壞還是病者先錯？照上面的例看來當然是病者先錯，上海有一位姓何的中醫也認到這樣。他說：「十年前，有一位醫生坐黄包車到一家大人家中看病，進門後，其家中竊竊私語曰：先生坐的是包車，後來聽說病者竟因此不服他的藥」。像這樣祇注意醫生的車子，而不注醫生的醫術，當然是病者罪過，但我以爲推原禍始又還是由於醫生先壞。因爲人類的心理係自私的，從前的病人，無論他怎樣闊老，總希望能以極少的醫藥費醫好他的病；在反面說來，醫生是操生殺之權的，結果當然是醫生得着勝利。今日這種惡習己牢不可破，人人都認到多花醫藥費才是好的，故禍端還是醫生起的。譬如經過租界要加倍徵收也是這樣，在未有此例之時，怪怕没有闊人無故加倍給診金的，或未加診金，病者就拒絶他看症的。現已定了這例，若有一個醫生敢破例不加收，人家就一定認到他是庸醫了。所以一定是醫生先壞，然後才有病者的錯誤，斷不是病者先錯誤，醫生才壞的，這己變成了鐵案！，</p>
<p>我眞百思不解，何以號稱救人命的醫生心腸還是這樣狠毒，尤其是現下的西醫，診金己高，藥價又貴，即到去門診一次，起碼要花數塊錢。若說你們的醫學和藥費成本都貴，要多得到息，則恐怕世上已無此好利息的生意：若說生活程度日高，每月無數百元收入不夠開銷，則更是瞞着良心講說話，認到醫生係一種特殊階級，即普通人都要這樣才可過活，則其他每月數十元或數元收入的人通通都要餓死！我以爲生活程度越高，一般平民生活越困難，醫生越發要放出菩薩心腸以救人。生活程度提高之日，正是醫生行善作福之時！若在生活高漲時，多敲取病人的醫藥費，正所謂「趁火打刦」屠殺人類的劊子手！是人類的公敵，我們當鳴鼓而攻之！故我很希望醫德好的醫生，此後能勉力服務社會，診金之收入，祗求能維持布衣粗食的生活；醫德壞的醫生能痛改前非，以造福人羣，「救人命」己「值千金」，何須多求代價？</p>

<h3>關於大餅油條</h3>
<p>— 文炳</p>
<p>題目標得這麽低下，却先要叙述一段革命逸話。</p>
<p>據說有某某要人是曾經嚼過大餅油條的，生活旣低到這一步，自然還是巷里英雄，胸懷是憤憤的，氣概是很高的，那麽，大餅油條的滋味，也許就會像西餐大菜一樣的適口果腹，老百姓在他們的各種美俏的掩護下，有不少在忠誠的拜眼他們，於是革命就有了基礎，花樣層層翻新，使力的唱喊開去，再經過一二度國難，在朝的天子便御喚一聲：「精誠團結」，於是乎大家伙合起來，巷里英雄也就摇身一變，成了當代扛鼎的要人了。</p>
<p>自然，在這過程裏，還有成羣成行的鑼卒，肩夫，這輩人看見革命己經成功，當然也要丢下鑼，摔掉扁挑，陞一級，要領些革命的果漿，來塡補奔跑惹得的滿身窟窿，於是就去敲扛鼎要人的門。</p>
<p>不料時代完全不同了，扛鼎要人也翻了臉，開初一二面，還是滿面春風，笑容可掬的禮待，說好話，開支票。天天去，而且去的人又多，要人就感受到從未有過的煩瑣，不免有些不眯人了，於是鑼卒肩夫氣不可當，聽說半點不斯文的指上要人的肥面袋，放肆的駡，有些更動起武來，唯一的理由，就是：</p>
<p>「你忘記了我們一同嚼大餅油條的時候了！你忘記了我們一同嚼大餅油條的時候了！」</p>
<p>至於駡，打的結果，是不是匀分到了革命的菓漿，是不是躋列上了嚼大餅油條時代的親愛精誠，甘苦共嘗，不大清晰。</p>
<p>總之，革命舞台上曾有過這麽一齣喜劇。</p>
<p>我們老百姓很明白，大餅油條雖是隨便什麽人都可以嚼，却不是隨便什麽人能把它意識得透，智識階級的嚼大餅油條，往往是不可靠的事，至若賣狗肉的革命同志，改治活動者的嚼大餅油條，那簡直是笑話之至。在嚼的時候，確實是一個個一條條的嚼下去的，而且也許是有餅有條大家嚼，非常公平。但是一到有了拍賣靈魂的機會，就連件帶伴的扔掉獨自個兒移開了。也就是某一時代之所以嚼，實實是因爲距離「剥削」的台幕還逺，財袋裏空空如也，迨到爬了上去，啓用剥削鏡，放出爪牙，情形就異樣了，財袋很快就會滿滿的。如此而後，不但不嚼大餅油條了，就是超等中餐也不會吃了，一定要嚼西餐大菜，才能煞得住癮，凸得出肚皮。同時爲了自己要嚼西餐大菜，油不可走散，所以先前的一些伙伴，也就必然的要被扔開。</p>
<p>眞在能嚼大餅油條的，不僅在中國，全世界都只有一些賣苦力的人，他們不曉得什麽「咬得菜根，才能富貴」，事實上他們的命，就這樣苦定了，連大餅油條都有時發生恐慌。也並不是他們眞的連大餅油條的份兒都没有，爲的是扛鼎的要人們間接直接的把他們的大餅油條都挖去了，移到他們的西餐大菜的台面上走油去了。</p>
<h3>槍聲</h3>
<p>— 敬嘉</p>
<p>今晚那個賣夜報的女人比往日來得更遲，鐘敲過七下，才見她帶了驚惶的臉把報遞給我。</p>
<p>「來得這樣遲！」我埋怨着。</p>
<p>「你先生没聽見槍聲？」她喘着氣說</p>
<p>「槍聲？」我驚問着。連正在哭着要銅板買泥人的弟弟也靜下來了。</p>
<p>「是的，就在××」路轉用。你們就没聽見？」</p>
<p>「没。什麽事？」</p>
<p>「捉强盜。强盜開槍，巡捕也開槍。結果，强盜跑了，×××菜館門前打死了一個過路的女人。怪可怕。一個洞，從背後穿到胸口。血流滿了那一塊行人路。」</p>
<p>「啊呀！」弟弟呌起來了。</p>
<p>「你先生不去看看？」她說完了就走了。我馬上跟着出去。</p>
<p>到了那兒。擠滿了人。一堆堆地分開着講着過去的一回事。人羣的中間一個女人躺着。血還在流。旁邊伏着一個在大哭着的女孩子，穿着破舊的衣裳。聽說是死者的孩子。</p>
<p>我故意擠在那一些在講着的人的中間，爲了想知道得詳細一些。據說死掉的是一個女乞丐，没有别人，除了那個孩子以外。他們都在嘆息着，賜給那哭着的孩子一些同情。</p>
<p>但，我是爲那個死者歡樂的，雖然未免太殘酷一點。離開了這悲哀的世間不比在街頭路角向人們要一個銅子强？于少，她不需要再爲明日的大餅發愁。</p>
<p>只有那個孩子是可憐的。然而一些空虚的同情並不能使她得救的。我相信她一定在怨恨强盜，没有强盜她不會　成一個没依靠的孤零人。然而强盜的產生，又不能使她有所了解的。世界是這末大，但又是這樣小，小得連一些立足的地方都没有啊上</p>

<h3>流浪者要歸宿－要家</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我爲什麽要受這麽多的挫折與磨難？我問過我自己，但自己也不能明白的告訴我：也許這問題你也是解决不了的。孤獨，窮，甚至於不能再活，使我對於這個問題更加懷疑？爲了這種種，我也只得向你吐一吐，向同情我的讀者吐一吐，即使没有什麽……然而能得透過一口抑積的悶氣，也是好的！唉！編者先生：我是一個没有的人啊！</p>
<p>一個没有父母，没有故鄉，没有其他一切的人！除了我這麽的一個外，或許是找不到同樣可憐的人吧！這裏，我用不着背歷史背自傳，——並且篇幅已不允許我；簡單的說：我是一個無家可歸的孩子，父母死得太早了；自私的人情，有誰肯憐憫這個孤兒一切呢？因爲不願意死，餓着肚皮，挨着凍，還硬硬的掙扎着——一天一天的想活下去，也一天一天的老是無定的流浪着。我眞僥倖，從街頭的閱報處認識了幾個字：同時我也眞不幸，識了這幾個字，使我感覺得苦痛。假如我像十二歳前的我——一字不識的我，那麽也許現在不會有這樣的問題吧！</p>
<p>一數年來，在大上海一要想找幾個同情我的朋友，在精神上學識上給我一些帮助。天哪！結果還是失望的，那裏有我的朋友——能夠給我同情與安慰的朋友呢？</p>
<p>雖然，我現在能免費在一個中學裏唸書；「銅臭」支配了我的心，委實太作弄我了。書要買的没錢？紙筆墨要買，也是没錢？天，天又冷了，衣！有什麽辦法啊！編者先生，一個身當其境的我。是如何的難堪呢？何况過去是受過生活的煎熬，遍體創痕。我想要一個家，我需要歸宿，然而，我是個流浪者，可怎辦呢！</p>
<p>編者先生，我肯信，同情的朋友是有的，不過是没有找到或是没有機會。即使其他是一個没有的話，至少你一定也會給我些許的同情吧！</p>
<p>記得天盧先生在青光上給某女士做了一件好事，雖然我是男性，請你也給我刋載出來吧！也許「人吃人肉」的現社會，還有許多同情於我的朋友。</p>
<p>我活不下去了，自殺的影子在我的週圍旋轉。</p>
<p>編者先生和親愛的讀者們！我應該走那一條路呢？你們能夠給我解答嗎？我在這裏盼望着，期待着！敬祝</p>
<p>撰安　萍上</p>
<p>編者按：人是過精神生活的動物，所以物質上儘可做一個流浪者，但精神上却不能不找個歸宿。有了歸宿，生活才會有推動力，才會有意義。</p>
<p>家——誠然是一般人所認爲精神的歸宿，但人的歸宿點，决不是非家不辦。大而功勛學業，小而彫蟲末技，亦莫不可以作爲我的歸宿也。</p>
<p>萍君是個流浪者，找個歸宿，誠然是需要的。但是一定要以家爲歸宿，則大可不必。萍君試稍一考量，即可覺悟，至少在你目下這種情景之下，家决不能慰藉你的。萍君萍君，快快在家之外，别找你的歸宿罷！</p>

<h3>上海（十五）</h3>
<p>— 張老三</p>
<p>我追上捉住她的手臂，想回她一句，却不好意思出口，在喉頭咽住了。　　「說啊！」</p>
<p>「想……眞想寫封信給她呢。」</p>
<p>「你要說的不是這句話。」敏姊掙脫我的手，忽然鄭重地說：「你應該寫封信給她！」</p>
<p>新牙的月窮己從東方探出頭來，我們踏着瑣碎的月影慢步歸去。</p>
<p>廿四橋</p>
<p>兩天後，我們接到了弟弟的信到火車站，在月臺上等候從杭州來的特别快車，我隨意對敏姊說：</p>
<p>「我這次脫離家庭，想不到能携我的弟弟同來上海；更想不到你亦同時脫離你汉父的勢力範圍。從媽放世到現在，反跑上同一的途徑，也是緣吧？」</p>
<p>敏姊望了我半嚮，我感覺我的失言，火車恰在這特蠕蠕的進站，我們就雜在人羣中向前走去。弟弟巳瞧見了我們，半個身子探出在窗外，揮動他手中的白布巾，蘋菓臉上盎然的微笑，顯示他小小的心扉中充滿着愉快。火車慢慢地停住，他搶在人前第一個跳下車來注視着敏姊似乎想開口。</p>
<p>「敏姊，認識嗎」？我問</p>
<p>「像在那裏瞧見過的。」傾了頭想。</p>
<p>「瞎說！」</p>
<p>「眞的，哥！」他握住敏姊的手「有一次，在小橋那邊瞧見過你，敏姊是嗎？」</p>
<p>「那裏？」我疑惑起來。</p>
<p>「就是即頂小橋。」弟弟舉起手來想指點似的，碰着了一個脚夫。</p>
<p>「好記性！」敏姊說，撫着他的頭。</p>
<p>「好常性！」我微笑。</p>
<p>「哥哥没有瞎說。」弟弟走在中間，他仰起頭來望着我們。</p>
<p>從旅館招待的噪雜音中踏出車站，我想趣了前夜的黄包車夫。</p>
<p>「那裏去？」我問敏姊。</p>
<p>「辣斐德路啊！」</p>
<p>獨自笑了，敏姊也像明白什似的，携着弟弟的手說：</p>
<p>「我們乘電車。」</p>
<p>弟弟第一次上上海來，他瞧着一切的景物，都是十分驚奇。電車馳上垃圾橋，他說：</p>
<p>「哥哥，」這橋大得很呢。及至望見底下污濁的黄浦「没有鄉下的好玩」　　廿五姐姐來了</p>
<p>兩個月後，由金體社員的努力，雜誌同學同時恢復。各人拼除意見，盡力各人的責任。學校由高飛親自主持，校址就是我們的社，所不同的這次並不是義務，收一點最低的學費，因爲我們對於濟没有意外的收入。雜誌委任了我，發了幾條義務徵稿的消息之後，復刋號上己有外界投來的稿件。敏姊對文藝很發生興趣，小品文寫來艶麗婉約，重慶笑風也都能寫稿，這一項雜誌的收入，就是我們基本金的全部了。</p>
<p>是初夏的晚上，白熱的電燈光下，己有成羣的飛蛾的投撲。我們正在整理正誼第二期的稿子，弟弟跑進來喊我：</p>

<h3>電影史上有名大失敗的事蹟（下）</h3>
<p>— 嘉榖譯</p>
<p>影片的失敗，是個個大明星，大導演，大製片家所不能免的。有的時候，聚了兩個大人物的智力，造成一張失敗的片子。即如曼麗璧克福的（Ｒlsita）。那個時候，德國的一張大片子，呌（Ｐassion）的，剛到美國受了美國大衆的歡迎。那張片子的主角是波拉尼格利（ＰolaＮegri）；導演是赫赫的劉别謙（ＥrnestＬubitsch）。曼麗心想著波拉尼格利旣可以做得那麽好，她自己决不會差的，不過要想法子，拿劉别謙請到美國來。劉别謙亦很贊成，因爲他深知這位美國的甜心是位絶頂聰明的女子，他就欣然就道了。他們於是極力合作起來，用盡心思拍攝那張（Ｒosita）結果是失敗了。但是曼麗璧克福和劉别謙名氣太大了，他們的聲名前途並没有受多大的影響。</p>
<p>却利卓别麟亦曾拍過還不值買膠片的錢片子，他拍過一張「巴黎一婦人」，（ＡＷomanofＰaris）他因爲要自己作導演，就在巴黎找到了一男一女拍起戲來。結果是一團糟。但很奇怪的，却因此造就了一位明星，就是扮那男角的亞道爾夫孟郁（ＡdolpheＭenjou）。</p>
<p>光榮的導演西昔地米爾，亦不是没有失敗的事蹟。他的聲明，曾因那張（ＴheＧodlessＧirl）而受到片刻的影響。那張片子是表現婦女訓導所裏的黑暗的，但是表現得過於殘酷了，和社會的冐口不適宜，因而失敗了。他還做過一張（ＪoantheiＷonan），是叙述法國ＪoanofＡrc一生的事蹟的。那亦是一張完全失敗的片子，但是奇怪得很，他這次的失敗，非但於他的聲名没有損失，並且帮助了他的事業，造就了一位大明星華雷斯李德（ＷallaceＲeid）。所以失敗這個東西，又像電光石火，不可捉摸的。</p>
<p>馮史都漢是個很特别的導演。他所拍製的影片，不是大成功，就是大失敗，在他自己是没有多大關係的，或是駕駛一條將沉的船，或是駕駛一只無敵的戰艦。Ｔhe　　　rryＷidow是他的偉大成功，賺進了無數的金錢。但是Ｇreed和ＴheＷeddineＭarch却又是無以復加的大失敗。Ｇreed裏面的一切，都是無人要看的一切物事的代表，但是公司裏居然讓他全本拍完了。這也祗可以歸之於</p>
<p>天數了。</p>
<p>詹姆士克魯斯（ＪamesＣruze）在成功了偉大的歷史劇（ＴheＣoveredＷagon之後，又拍了一部（ＢeggaronＨorseback），於是他因前一片所造成的光榮的記錄，又被第二片掩蓋了。愛末脫弗林（EmmetFlynn）所導演的（ＩntheＰalaceoftheKing），和勒克斯英格蘭姆所導演的（ＭareＮostrum）都使他們的名聲降落了。大概像金維多（ＶictorＫing）那樣鼎鼎大名的導演，要是連打兩張失敗的片子，要是没有絶頂的重振旗鼓的能力，就算是一生的事蹟完了。（完）</p>

<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「採珍記」ＯrdersＩsＯrders</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>在矛盾的政治體系之下，我們又發現了這一奇蹟。英國的製片者在和軍隊開玩笑了。</p>
<p>什麽是命令？「命令即是命令」，這是軍隊中最大的特點。然而有些人們却認爲這是十分可笑的了。可不是麽？這一影片就是和軍隊正面譏諷的了。同時製片也就以自身的立塲來解說一切。作者一方面顯揚軍隊的紀律嚴格，但反面却描畫他們的腐敗。軍隊當局先不肯給製片者拍攝電影，及後因製片商「百般解喻」，終於借軍隊來攝製印度的駐軍和叛民之間的衝突事件，——所謂有歷史性的「拿福克」事件。可是到後來到底因該片有關於國家文明，因一偶然的機會而將製成之影片燒燬了。</p>
<p>我們並不相信英國軍隊眞的如影片上所說的那般可笑，不過以電影生活和軍隊生活相比較，却更見有味了。我們看罷，大批的女人，走進軍營，使兵士們眉飛色舞，居然在嚴肅的軍營中，飲酒作樂。將軍的神氣活現，以女導演放肆輕佻相對照，他如電影生活的人們在軍營中居然賭博，而將軍見之只好摇頭。這些都是很有趣味的譏諷，然而主要的却是將製成的影片因顧全國家體面而焚燬，由此我們可知他們是何等的企圖掩飾。而在此劇作者存心不肯讓製片者屈服於軍令之下，因而藉二小兵之失愼焚之了事。至於在拍印度叛民暴動時之場面，那弄假成眞的事實，更見生動。</p>
<p>ＷalterＦorld的名字，中國人雖覺生疏，但其導演之成績至足稱譽。同樣是一部喜劇，英國人的手法之下，决不像美國人的盡情誇張。我以爲這裏的成績，就是在喜劇中發生眞實之感。他如前後對於軍隊生活的素描，傳達命令時的連續的面部特寫。快和慢的Ｔenpo之調節，都證明導演者的聰明和經騐。</p>
<p>飾團長的那位老演員眞有演劇的天才，不輕佻而含藴，不誇大而自然，眞可謂難能可貴。至於那一個在美國西部片子中常飾教頭之類的傑姆斯格利生，在這裏却一貫的是美國風味。姑勿論他如何努力，到底不會討好的。</p>
<h3>評「神女」（卽神奇女子）ＴheＭiracleWoman</h3>
<p>— 摩爾</p>
<p>這張「神女」就意義而論，却是美國片中稀有的佳作。在這裏，我們看到「上帝的女兒們」，是怎樣不加憐恤的撤換清廉貧病的老牧師，而一定要使他的女兒代替講道。在這裏我們可以看到人們，因爲要「利用而生財」，而組織宗教機關，專以宗教醫病，或稱使憂苦者轉爲安樂，可是我們看到人們在利用宗教藉以號召外，結果并連工具（牧師）而毁之。這種宗教的内在，我們是應該知道，而舊藝術家是輕易不肯暴露出來的，「神女」中却說明了。</p>
<p>當然，「神女」的作者，并不是十分正確的站在反宗教的立塲上的，他只是認爲人們利用宗教，而宗教的本身是不壞，所以他借少女的口，拿宣教的聽衆大駡爲假仁假義，他把飛行家約翰加生，寫成誠實的信徒。但是「神女」的製作者，也不是宗教的擁護者，這點在最後約翰加生救出了小女，「於是與女另謀生計」，而再也不願到宗教，就可以看到，至少他認爲宗教雖則不壞，但是個空虚的東西。他的意思，以爲宗教這東西是可以暫時放棄了。原因自然因爲有人利用宗教，而不是了解宗教本身的「雅片」作用。歐美舊藝術家肯於這樣主張，確是了不起的。</p>
<p>「神女」的意義，雖則相當可取，但是他的技術「即使舊的」是極拙劣的。粗粗一看，我這樣說是有内容形式二元論的傾向，實際上，并不是的，因爲舊的形式，只合舊的内容，新的内容，也要有新的形式纔是。「神女」的内容，旣然相當的進步，而新的形式，在目前美國電影界，還没有好好的成長，於是，作者只能運用較舊的形式，無疑地，他就因此而不調和，不適合，結果是兩敗俱傷，新的形式的成熟，一定是漫漫的逐漸發展，而不是一躍而至。「神女」的形式上的失敗，正是證實了内容形式的一元。舉例來說，像少女在講壇上駡聽衆爲假仁假義時，無論如何，總要聲色俱厲，同時更因爲他的講道者，所以要含有靜穆的神態，現在「神女」中女主角的表演，旣然樣歌女在聽衆面表演的弄姿作態，而導演者，也用表現舞台歌塲，同樣迅速變換的短鏡頭。無疑地，因爲女主角做慣了「歌舞美人」，而導演者也製作慣了風情影片。我們在這種地方，一定「會心非逺」。至於羣衆間宗教空氣的不濃厚，本來是能夠帮助說明，聽衆并不是眞心信教的，尤其是講道的一塲，不過，得不償失罷了。</p>
<p>總之，就意義力面講，「神女」不失爲佳作。特别是說「向美國片要求正確的意識是滑稽」的人們，是更應該注意的。雖則「神女」并不是百分之百的正確，但較肉感神怪者又何如？</p>

<h3>鹽潮&lt;不久公映P]　　「香草美人」因爲反帝意識太濃烈，遭租界當局之忌，加以禁映了。目前明星公司當局正在據理力爭，希望不久仍能在租界與觀衆相見。繼「香草美人」以後在新光公映的，將爲徐欣夫往返滬杭道上十餘次而攝成的「鹽潮」。該片外景地點在，東力大港」的澉浦，攝取十分困難。因此「鹽潮」的公映，實爲電影界值得紀念之事。又：皇后胡蝶據說要編自傳，「鹽潮」是她在待欣夫導演下第一次對鏡頭赤脚：這，在她的自傳中該也是重要的一頁。電影小說花蕚情深（ＬittleＷoman）（四）  素因　　他們初次見面，總不免有些拘束，但是侍者送上茶點來他們吃着喝著，就漸漸歡治起來了。他告訴她，他的名字本來呌西奥都爾，但是大家都稱他爲勞萊。他又告訴她，他們的名字他都知道了。他說：（你們總是怪有趣的，我，就情不自禁要常常偷看你們了。一奇奥說）；「那我們從此以後，不拉没窗簾，儘你看好了。但是，有這樣張望的，你不好走過來和我」們一淘玩嗎？我們是歡迎你的。勞萊很歡迎地接受了她的請求，因爲他覺得他的龍父，一走會答應的。　　奇奥看著墻上掛的大油畫，她自言自語著；「你看，要是走近了他，他到亦不見得怎樣」可怕呢？」她清脆的聲音，傳到客堂喪兩個人的耳朶裏。一個是勃羅克，他來授課了。他聽了奇奥的話，很侷促地看著他的東家說道；「我在樓下等一等吧。」他說著就怱怱下樓去了。勞倫斯老先生走近了會客室，奇奥和勞萊都没有注意他。奇奥又說道：「我是不怕他的。不過他的相貌，多呌人心悸呀。他的眼睛，慈愛得很，我很喜歡他，但他狗呌起來，一定很嚇人的。」勞萊道：「你還没有看見他暴怒的時候呢。」勞倫斯進來了，他盛氣向著奇奥道：「好，你不怕我嗎？」奇奥給他一嚇，嚇得話都說不上來了。她囁嚅著道：「不不不——不—不很怕。」她的腿都抖擻了。勞倫斯道，「不是我的相貌，能夠呌人心悸的嗎？」奇奥强辯道；「我說或者可以的，」勞倫斯一步不肯放鬆的道；「我會狗呌的，是不是？」奇奥道：「那是偶然的事。」勞倫斯又問道：「雖然這樣，但是你還是喜歡我的，是不是？」奇奥這纔恍然那老頭子是尋她的開心呢。她連忙說道；「是的，不錯的，我很喜歡你。」那老頭子一臉的氷霜融化了，他說；「我亦喜歡你。」奇奥要回家了，老頭子還很高興地親自送她到家門口。　　這樣一來，雖則南方打著很猛烈的仗，雖則他們爲父親的安全而擔憂，雖則爲貧窮而煩惱，雖則有全家孩子教書的苦楚，雖則有姑母的脾氣古怪，馬區家倒也融融洩洩，過了一冬。四位小姑娘時常因爲勞倫斯老先生的請求，而到他家裏和勞萊一齊玩耍。美格和約翰勃羅克很投機，他們常在禮拜日從禮拜堂出來之後，同去游玩。奇奥看著他們二人的愛苗怒發，私下擔著憂。蓓絲自己的鋼琴壞了。勞倫斯常請她到他家裏用他的鋼琴。奇奥空下來還常常從事於著作。有一天勞萊看見奇奥從一家報館裏出來。他問她到報館裏做什麽事情。奇奥因爲勞萊問得太急了，就給他一張支票看，上面寫著付給奇奥馬區小姐大洋一元五角。她告訴他這是賣掉了一段小說的錢。勞萊喊了起來；「呼啦，馬區小姐，美國著名的女作家！」從此以後，勞萊更加佩服奇奥了。（未完）</h3>

<h3>Huang Shaoxiong Arrives in Beiping Yesterday Huang Discusses... The Three Provincial Authorities Agree in Principle to the Organizational Principles of the Mongolian Autonomous Region Government Awaits Report to the Central Government in Nanjing to Draft Measures to be Passed and Implemented Bai Yunti Initiates a Gathering of Fellow Mongolian Provincials in Beiping</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Huang Shaoxiong arrived in Beiping at 2 PM today. According to his talk, the authorities of the three provinces of Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan have agreed in principle to the organization of the Mongolian Autonomous Region Government. He himself must return to Nanjing to report, and then the central government will draft measures. Only after the Legislative Yuan passes the organizational regulations can work begin to establish the Autonomous Region Government. The current Presidium of the Autonomous Council is still in Bailingmiao. There are rumors of a meeting being held in Pangjiang, but he has not heard of it. The truth about the autonomous region organized by the Japanese in Dolon is still unclear. Dolon is currently occupied by puppet troops, and other issues can only be discussed after the government recovers Dolon through diplomatic means. He himself will go to Nanjing in two or three days, and representatives of Prince Yun and others will also go to Nanjing to consult on the organization of the Autonomous Region Government. Fu and Zhao are still in Taiyuan. The report on this trip to Mongolia is still being drafted. It is undecided whether he will go to Jiangxi after arriving in Nanjing. There was no telegram from Fu and Jiang inviting him to take a trip to the Southwest. He only discussed Mongolian affairs with Yan in Taiyuan, and did not mention the current situation. He himself is in a remote and isolated area, and is also unclear about the current situation. Huang has arranged to meet He and Huang tonight for discussions. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A prominent Mongolian from Mongolia who arrived in Beiping said that after Inner Mongolia requested autonomy, Huang Shaoxiong and the Mongolian princes discussed and reached a proper solution. The Mongolian youth hoped to organize an autonomous government and have the central government dispatch senior officials to guide it, but Huang did not agree. The youths also nodded in agreement after being persuaded by the princes, but they hope that the government can proceed with all matters in accordance with the results of the discussions in Bailingmiao. The locations of the first and second autonomous region governments have not yet been found. A decision can be made after the organizational law of the autonomous region government is promulgated. After the princes met in Bailingmiao, they went to Pangjiang for another meeting. It is heard that the focus was on the Usuqin and Xilingol Leagues, discussing internal issues such as the selection of representatives to be sent to Nanjing, how to present the intention to request autonomy to the central government, and future border defense and diplomatic intelligence. The Ikher League will also convene a meeting in Suiyuan in the coming days to engage in discussions. It is heard that the representatives to be sent to Nanjing in the future will be organized by league, and each league will be led by a Meiren. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Bai Yunti and others initiated a gathering of fellow Mongolians in Beiping, scheduled for noon on the 10th. The organization of the Inner Mongolia Regional Government will be discussed, urging the central government to promulgate the organizational law of the regional government as soon as possible, and go to the Central Executive Committee in Nanjing within a week.

<h3>Huang Invites Yin Tao and Others to Discuss North China Diplomacy Concrete Decisions Made on Various Issues Tao Shangming Says the Takeover of Yuguan May be Realized by the End of the Month</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Huang invited Yin Tong, Tao Shangming, Li Zeyi, and others last night to exchange opinions on the North China diplomatic issues. Concrete measures have been drafted for the issues of traffic, postal service, and customs establishment, and have been telegraphed to the central government for approval. Once approved, they will be implemented accordingly. After the Japanese Embassy Naval Attaché Fujiwara returned to his country, his successor, Major Okino, has departed for China and is expected to arrive in Beiping on the 11th. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tao Shangming said that his previous visit to Yuguan to visit Imai and Imai's visit to Beiping were both to solicit the intentions of relevant parties regarding the takeover of Yuguan. It was decided that the takeover will be carried out according to the method previously agreed upon in Yuguan. After Imai informs our side of the handover period and detailed procedures by letter, our side will then take over. After Imai returned to Yuguan, he is currently communicating with the Kwantung Army by telegram. The takeover of Yuguan is generally not a problem and may be realized by the end of this month. Huang convened figures related to North China diplomacy last night to discuss general meeting affairs. The Japanese side, citing that Dongluocheng is outside the Great Wall, demanded that it be assigned to the puppet state and prepared to build a memorial to the Japanese soldiers who died in the Yuguan Incident in Yuguan, but this has not been formally proposed. It is heard that the Japanese side will expand the puppet organization in Yuguan and prepare to build a large-scale market outside Dongluocheng. Although this matter has not been verified, it is worth noting. The date of inauguration of the new magistrate of Linyu County, Yuan Tai, is undecided. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Rugeng said that the Jixian-Miyun Commissioner's Office is being renovated and will be formally established within a week. He himself will go to work after its establishment and will invite the magistrates of the counties under his jurisdiction to consult on ways to improve local administration and security. After completing these tasks, he will inspect the counties. (8th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Fourth Plenary Session May Be Slightly Delayed So That Southwest Central Committee Members Can Participate</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Party is still optimistic about the Fourth Plenary Session. A certain central committee member said that before Zhang Ji and others went to Shanghai, the central government instructed Zhang and others to meet with the Southwest central committee members in Hong Kong and Guangdong, urging Hu and others to come to Nanjing together before the 15th to avoid delaying the meeting. If due to factual obstacles they cannot arrive as scheduled, it is proposed that after the opening ceremony of the Fourth Plenary Session on the 20th, it may be delayed by one or two days before the formal meeting is held. Another central committee member said that whether the plenary session can be held as scheduled depends on the facts. In the event of a postponement, it will not exceed one month at most.

<h3>Naval Department Suffers Heavy Losses in Fujian Rebellion</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) During the Fujian rebellion, the Naval Department estimates that the losses were extremely heavy. The department's large quantities of military supplies, previously stored in the naval warehouses of the Mawei naval port in Fujian, were not evacuated in time and were all confiscated by the Fujian side, totaling a value of more than seven million yuan. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Fujian Province Traffic Issues Telecommunications, Shipping, and Postal Services</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain important traffic official said that the telecommunications agencies directly under the Ministry of Communications in Fujian include the Fujian Telecommunications Administration and the Fuzhou and Shantou radio stations. After the Fujian rebellion, the two radio stations were the first to be occupied. As for the director of the Telecommunications Administration, who was originally recommended by Jiang Guangnai, the other side did not need to use force to take over. However, although the above agencies have been seized, apart from the radio station buildings being forcibly occupied by them, the central government has not suffered any losses in terms of the current income from telecommunications, because Fujian's administration has always been poor and the income from telecommunications has been freely disposed of and never remitted to the central government. In terms of shipping administration, apart from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company immediately suspending operations when the Fujian affair was exposed last month, other national and foreign shipping companies have been instructed by the Shanghai Shipping Administration Bureau to suspend operations uniformly to avoid accidents. As for foreign companies such as Jardine Matheson and Nissin Kisen, they are still operating as usual to this day. In order to cut off their supplies and eliminate them as soon as possible, the central government has to negotiate for a unified suspension of operations. However, these two companies, in order to seek business, have taken the opportunity to add more liner services and are not subject to inspection by our warships, which is deeply regrettable. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently negotiating with the British and Japanese embassies and consulates in China to respect our national laws and regulations, while the Naval Department is strictly enforcing inspections of incoming and outgoing vessels. In Fujian's postal service, including the Fuzhou Postal Administration, there are one first-class post office and more than sixty second- and third-class post offices in various places. The postal director of the bureau is an Englishman named Greenfe, so the other side did not dare to forcibly take over. The rumor that it has been seized is completely inaccurate. However, the other side is conducting very strict inspections of mail, which is causing many difficulties. At present, formal official documents and mail have been ordered by the Directorate General of Posts to be prevented from reaching them, while ordinary letters are still being sent as usual to avoid affecting people's communication. What method will be adopted to deal with this in the future will depend on future circumstances. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Resolutions of the National Government Meeting Seven Cases of Resolved Expenditure Calculations Approved Turning Over the Motion to Relieve the Pudong Wind Disaster The President of the Examination Yuan's Request for Demerit Should Not Be Discussed</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government Committee held its ninth meeting on the 8th, attended by Committee Members Ye Chucang, Yang Shuzhuang, Jing Hengyi, and Huang Fusheng, chaired by Lin Sen, with Secretary-General Wei Huai, Chief Aide-de-Camp Lu Chao, Comptroller-General Chen Qicai, Director of the Document Bureau Xu Jingzhi, Director of the Printing Bureau Zhou Zhongliang, and Secretaries Zhu Wenzhong and Gao Lingbai. Report one item (omitted)</p>
<p>Matters for discussion</p>
<p>(1) The case of the Tianjin Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry's calculation book for January to June of the 21st year of the Republic exceeding 50% of the approved budget. Resolution: The overspending is too large, but it is approved for cancellation, and the Auditing Department is instructed to pay attention to auditing its calculation books.</p>
<p>(2) The case of the Ministry of Education's expenditure calculations for April, May, and June of the 21st year of the Republic exceeding 50%. Resolution: Approved for cancellation.</p>
<p>(3) The case of the expenditure calculations for April to June of the 21st year of the Republic of the Capital National Goods Exhibition Hall of the Ministry of Industry exceeding the reduced standard. Resolution: Approved for cancellation.</p>
<p>(4) The case of the expenditure calculations for February to July of the 21st year of the Republic of the business institutions such as the Nanjing Railway Administration Office under the Nanjing Municipal Government exceeding 50% of the original budget. Resolution: Approved for cancellation.</p>

<p>(6) The case of the expenditure calculations for February to May of the 21st year of the Republic of the Film Examination Committee exceeding the reduced standard. Resolution: Approved for cancellation.</p>
<p>(7) The case of the expenditure calculations for February to June of the 21st year of the Republic of the Ningbo Branch of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau exceeding 50% of the principled budget. Resolution: Approved for cancellation.</p>
<p>(8) Comptroller-General's presentation on following the review regarding the Minister of Finance's proposal to allocate 200,000 yuan to relieve the wind disaster in various counties of Pudong. After investigation, the request is indeed urgently needed. It is proposed to handle it in accordance with the provisions of Article 39 of the Budget Regulations and separately instruct compliance. Resolution: Approved as is.</p>
<p>(9) Presentation by Dai Chuanxian, President of the Examination Yuan, and Niu Yongjian, Vice President, regarding the awarding of certificates to the successful candidates of the Second Higher Examination held by the Yuan on the 2nd of this month. During the etiquette procedure, regarding the matter of silence, it was originally set for three minutes. The usher had already announced three minutes, but it was abruptly ended after only a few seconds. The awarding ceremony was so grand, yet there was such a mistake, which was extremely impolite. The successful candidates are just entering the government and were immediately given such a bad impression, which is particularly shameful. It is proposed to conduct self-reporting and request that your government give a demerit as a warning. In addition to the staff responsible for the ceremony already receiving a demerit from the Yuan, it is appropriate to present the case for your review and implementation. Resolution: The requested punishment should not be discussed. (8th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Cautious Transport and Sale of Grain to Relieve Rural Areas</h3>
<p>Representatives from the Eight Provinces Grain Conference gathered in Shanghai on the 7th and resolved to prepare to establish a Grain Transport and Sales Bureau, and have already drafted the regulations. After approval, preparations will begin. According to the conference record, the purpose stated in Article 2 of the Transport and Sales Bureau's regulations is to transport and sell grain, with the aim of regulating grain prices and relieving rural areas. This important mission requires the united efforts of the entire country to achieve success. In terms of financial resources, it is especially necessary to rely on the power of the government to cope with this undertaking. Only then can it be effective. One million yuan in capital, if managed by private individuals, can indeed be regarded as a huge financial resource. But in terms of adjusting the prices of food for farmers who own three hundred million or more people, and rescue more than 34 million square miles of land, then is inevitable a drop in the bucket. Aid is feared to be not very much. The decline of our country's rural areas has spread throughout the country, not a local problem of one province or one county. For example, in the north, the land is becoming less fertile every day. Those who engage in agricultural labor, even if they work hard all year round, are still inevitably frozen and hungry in good years. In addition, since the invasion of industrial capital into China in modern times, the dream of self-sufficiency in rural areas has been completely shattered. Agricultural products are no longer used for self-use by rural areas, but have become commodities in the market. If transportation is convenient and circulation is flexible, it may still be possible to maintain the status quo. However, the products of industrial countries and agricultural products are continuously imported into China, causing our rural areas to become increasingly tight. The grain transportation has almost completely stopped, so the rice price in places with good harvests has fallen below five yuan, while famine-stricken provinces still have starving people everywhere. Even fewer people pay attention to improving seeds and managing land. If such abnormal phenomena are allowed to continue without correction, even in a peaceful situation, it is feared that it will lead to disaster. What is more, in today's situation where there are strong enemies invading externally and bandit disasters multiplying internally?</p>
<p>Agricultural countries are in a period of transition in the current world situation. How can the old rural economy resist capital?</p>
<p>The frenzy of the original theory. Therefore, one can only follow the trend and seek temporary peace. However, in European countries, when industry flourished in the 19th century, rural areas were inevitably difficult, but cities gradually prospered. At the same time, unexpected wealth can be obtained from colonial markets to supplement the country's lack of national strength. Our China has countless sources of wealth, hidden underground and waiting to be developed. However, at this time of intense competition, its own economy is weak, and it is impossible to urgently seek industrial development. Therefore, the city is in decline along with the world economic panic. The weak rural areas are even more indirectly affected and appear more and more exhausted. .</p>
<p>The current plan to rescue the rural economy must make the rural economy circulate flexibly. It must ensure that agricultural products are not piled up in warehouses and allowed to rot. At the same time, what must be paid attention to is that the general living standards of farmers have fallen to a level that cannot be lowered any further. Their ability to consume manufactured goods is almost zero. Therefore, high-interest exploitation in rural areas must be strictly prohibited. The act of buying futures must be carried out fairly by impartial institutions. Only then can farmers gradually regain their ability. The turning point of the urban economy is tied to this. Whether our country is large or not, its development depends on political relations, such as Beiping, or on commercial circulation, such as Hankou and Tianjin. Although Shanghai has some modern industrial organizations, it seems to have the prototype of industrial capital. In fact, in Shanghai, the capital power of commerce is still larger than that of industrial capital. Moreover, the exported goods are mostly agricultural products and agricultural by-products. Most of the purely industrial products belong to handicraft manufacturing. In short, the prosperity of the entire national economy of our country depends more on agriculture and less on industry and commerce. However, because the capital of industry and commerce is concentrated, the power it expresses is greater. Agricultural economics are scattered throughout the countryside. Although there are many, they do not occupy an important position. However, in reality, if rural areas do not receive appropriate relief, cities will eventually be trapped and unable to free themselves. This is what must be paid attention to at the beginning of providing relief to rural areas. The transportation and sale of grain is indeed an urgent task in our country, but it may not be able to solve all the misfortunes of the rural economy. At the very least, it should be able to eliminate the pathological state of grain stagnation and alleviate the difficulties of inflexible circulation in the rural economy. If these two points can be effectively implemented, then the beneficiaries are not only limited to rural areas. Even the recovery of urban prosperity is based on this. Industrial development still depends on rural areas, so we sincerely pray for the success of the Eight Provinces Grain Conference and the implementation of grain sales, and hope that it will expand to the entire country.</p>
<h3>Liu Xiang Orders Blockade of Bandit Areas and Puts Rear Cities Under Martial Law Xuan Sui Can Be Captured Immediately</h3>
<p>(Hankou) Liu Xiang ordered the blockade of bandit areas and placed the rear cities of Chongqing, Wanxian, and Chengdu under martial law. The Jiangxi Headquarters has established a fourth recruitment office in Hankou. No other departments are allowed to establish their own. (8th Telegram)</p>

<h3>Wan Fulin Discusses the Recent Situation of the Northeast Army Zhang Xueliang May Arrive in Shanghai This Month Giving Supplies to the Anti-Japanese Army in the Northeast is Difficult 150,000 Northeast Soldiers Remain</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Wan Fulin visited Jiang in Jiangxi and said in Nanjing that the generals in North China have been hoping for Zhang Xueliang's return since his departure. Chairman Jiang also telegraphed Zhang, instructing him to start his return journey immediately. He may arrive in Shanghai and enter Nanjing this month, or may attend the Fourth Plenary Session. However, the Central Government has not yet determined what responsibilities will be given to him. The number of anti-Japanese soldiers remaining in the mountains and jungles outside the pass is approximately 60,000, belonging to Wang Delin's old troops. The Japanese puppet troops are helpless when they see them. They launch attacks several times and take advantage of fatigue to plunder. Moreover, during the Qing Sha Zhang month from April to June, they destroy everywhere. However, they feel a great lack of military pay. More than 20,000 Northeast refugees have entered the pass and are scattered in the Tianjin and Beiping areas, living in hardship. The central government intends to form a relief association, but it has not yet been established. He himself discussed it once with Director Zhu, and Wang agreed to allocate funds for relief. However, some of the refugees own fields outside the pass and miss their hometowns very much. They have already left the pass first, also numbering several thousand. The Northeast Army hates civil strife and expressed indignation at the Fujian Rebellion. From now on, they will obey the orders of the central government. In addition, due to financial relations, they have been greatly reduced in size. The current remaining force is approximately 150,000 men. The monthly pay was originally 4.5 million, but now it has been changed to 3.7 million yuan issued by the central government each month, which is barely maintained. Within the most recent period, the Japanese army within the pass can, in accordance with the agreement, retreat to the designated areas. (8th Dispatch)</p>

However, through traffic is still being pursued by Tao Shangming, Li Zeyi, Yin Tong, and others. Yin Tong has already drafted measures for reference. However, whether through traffic can be implemented still needs to be approved by the Ministry of Railways, and there is a possibility of realization. As for the issues of postal service and customs, because the intentions of both sides are still difficult to reconcile, there is no discussion of this for the time being. The original budget for the Political Affairs Council was 80,000 yuan per month. Since the Finance Office was abolished and the Political Affairs Office was merged into the Secretariat, after the original Councilor's Office was reduced in scope, the total monthly expenditure is now about 65,000 yuan.

<h3>Call for a Fascist-Style New International Organization; Britain Believes Italy Intends to Position Itself as the Sole Arbiter of Europe; No Less Than a Declaration of War Against the League of Nations; France, Czechoslovakia, and Other Countries Discuss Countermeasures; United States Reaffirms Unwillingness to Interfere in European Affairs</h3>
<p>Rome: Italy's current policy seems to be to seek Germany's re-entry into a reorganized League of Nations. The organization of the League of Nations should be fundamentally reformed to become a kind of world architecture, with a steering committee composed of the four major Western powers as its foundation. This would merge the Four-Power Pact with the new League of Nations covenant. This new League of Nations covenant will be completely separate from the Treaty of Versailles. The headquarters of the new League of Nations does not need to be located in Geneva. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(London) The "aide-memoire" on the reform of the League of Nations organization and its purpose, proposed by the Fascist Congress, has put the League of Nations on the path of division. This situation is not denied in London. A diplomat in a high position spoke about this matter to a Reuters reporter today, saying that Italy wants to become the sole arbiter of Europe with the help of Germany, Russia, and Japan. The only result of this situation will inevitably be a division between democratic and dictatorial countries in Europe. The United Kingdom may advocate a compromise solution, hoping that the League of Nations can safely undergo constructive reform. However, there are those who want to revise the Treaty of Versailles, and there are those who strongly oppose this step. It may not be easy to reconcile the two. In the view of people here, Italy's aide-memoire will promote the tendency of countries in the Near East and Far East to establish their own separate banners. This can be seen from the frequent visits of Balkan and Turkish politicians in the autumn. If the new group of countries in the Near East and Far East is established, it will be based on fear of the great powers' private control and strong opposition to treaty revisions. It is expected that the United States will ultimately not join the League of Nations, whether the League of Nations is reformed or not, because the US Congress does not advocate participating in foreign disputes. Political critics here are confident that China will oppose the reorganization of the League of Nations, fearing that after the League of Nations is reorganized, Japan will return to Geneva and be in a position of control.

<h3>Like a Bolt from the Blue</h3>
<p>(Paris) Italy's recent intimidating statement that if the League of Nations is not fundamentally reorganized, Italy will withdraw from the League of Nations has been heard by the public here and regarded as nothing less than a bolt from the blue. In the political circles, the French government's invitation to Czech Foreign Minister Beneš to come to France is considered a direct response after receiving the report of the resolution of the Italian Fascist Congress. Beneš is expected to arrive in France next Monday or Tuesday, and his meeting with the French Foreign Minister is scheduled for December 14. Renowned political reporter Botina wrote in the Paris Echo newspaper that the establishment of the Four-Power Pact was actually the first step in Italy's attempt to revise the peace treaty, and the recent demand for the reorganization of the League of Nations is the second step in the same direction. According to Botina's opinion, Prime Minister Mussolini was actually one of the promoters of the resolution of the Fascist Congress, and his motivation was the note sent by France to the Italian government, stating that if Germany does not return to the League of Nations, France will not ratify the Four-Power Pact. Botina also said that France's invitation to Beneš to come to France can be interpreted as France's rejection of Italy's demands. In addition, the famous reporter Sanbelis also disclosed an important article in the Paris Daily News, stating that the League of Nations has now entered the process of dissolution, because the major powers are actually unwilling to listen to the League of Nations' fantasy commands and have no ability to exercise real power. Other newspapers are also pessimistic about the League of Nations, and articles with titles such as "The Destruction of Geneva" and "The Remnants of the Anglo-French Front" are everywhere.

<h3>United States Does Not Want to Take the Bait</h3>
<p>(New York) A Washington correspondent for the New York Times telegraphed that the general opinion in Washington on the resolutions of the Fascist Party Congress is that the United States cannot be induced to join the League of Nations. If Mussolini's purpose is this, then his efforts will not move the Americans. Senator Borah commented that the United States will never taste this bait. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Officials here expressed their opinions on the Italian Pan-Fascist Congress's request to reorganize the League of Nations, saying that the United States is unwilling to join whether the League of Nations maintains its current status or implements reorganization. The United States' desire not to interfere in European politics is even stronger today. It is heard that when Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov was in Washington, President Roosevelt directly told him this intention. Although he is willing to continue to participate in the work of the disarmament conference, any political plan in Europe, if its constraints are more explicit than those stipulated by the Kellogg-Briand Pact, will not be accepted by the United States. The general public is quite skeptical about what the Italian plan to reorganize the League of Nations can achieve, and all believe that Prime Minister Mussolini's clever strategy is aimed at enriching the Four-Power Pact. The Washington Star reported that some small countries in Europe, or what some consider the "satellites" of some large countries, often intervene when discussing political issues, which is quite inconvenient. Mussolini wants the major European countries, including the Soviet Union, to be in charge of everything and not be subject to the constraints of the small countries. Mussolini also wants to solve some European political problems outside the scope of the League of Nations and the Treaty of Versailles. Officials said that this plan would not be acceptable to France. The key point of the recent talks between Italian and Russian representatives is not the reorganization of the League of Nations, but the rapprochement between Russia and Italy, or the subsequent improvement of relations between Russia and Germany. This is considered by Italy to be an indispensable condition for maintaining peace in Europe. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>Germany Expresses No Opinion</h3>
<p>Rome: The German ambassador to Italy met with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini today and said that Hitler has no suggestions on disarmament and the League of Nations. It is now believed that the Italian Prime Minister is quite disappointed. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Rome: The Italian government is eager to start negotiations with Germany on important international issues. Foreign Minister Suvich will go to Berlin within two or three days to meet with German Chancellor Hitler. The issues to be discussed by both parties will be: (1) Mussolini's plan to reorganize the League of Nations; (2) the disarmament issue; (3) whether to expand the Four-Power Pact to include Russia, Japan, and the United States. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>
<h3>Views of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Italian Prime Minister Mussolini advocated reforming the League of Nations and advised the United States, Germany, Japan, and Russia to participate. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has the following views on this: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not received any negotiations from any country. Judging from news telegrams, if the League of Nations is to be strengthened, it is necessary to add the four major powers of the United States, Germany, Japan, and Russia. Italy's advocacy is indeed a natural move. However, regarding Japan, since withdrawing from the League of Nations, there was an imperial edict issued on March 27 stating that although Japan has withdrawn from the League of Nations, it will continue to cooperate in all peaceful endeavors. Therefore, Japan's attitude must depend on whether the content of this League of Nations reorganization plan is in line with this intention. Italy strongly advocates expanding the League of Nations' economic activities to seek international distribution of raw materials. In fact, the unfair distribution of world raw materials is a cause threatening world peace, and the major countries with the richest raw materials should reflect on this as soon as possible.

<h3>Avenol Goes to London</h3>
<p>(Geneva) League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol departed from here tonight for Paris and London. On Sunday of next week, Avenol will speak to members of the British Parliament, and on Tuesday, he will speak at the Royal Institute of International Affairs. The topics are all related to the League of Nations. Because the situation of Italy advocating the reorganization of the League of Nations is serious, Avenol's speech in England this time must have special significance. (Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>
<h3>Henderson Travels Busily Between Britain and France for Disarmament; Deeply Concerned About the Shaking Foundation of the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(London) Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson said after returning to London from Paris today that not only the future of the Disarmament Conference, but the entire "collective peace" system based on the League of Nations is also in a critical moment of survival. Henderson has visited many European political leaders on the issue of diplomatic negotiations between the great powers and Germany, but the result is not entirely disappointing. He expressed that he still hopes that these secret negotiations will produce a fully agreed-upon plan so that the Disarmament Conference can be reconvened in January next year. However, he intends to stay in the UK temporarily before the military conference reopens. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>(London) Disarmament Chairman Henderson met with British Foreign Secretary Simon this afternoon for discussions. Henderson repeatedly stated in Paris that armaments can only be reduced, not increased, but the United Kingdom is inclined to acknowledge Germany's claim to a partial rearmament, a contradiction that is undeniable here. It is generally believed that it is easier to achieve results by limiting armaments on the basis of free allowance by various countries and determining the ratio of armaments of various countries in accordance with the London Naval Agreement, than with a simple disarmament plan. As indicated by events in recent months, simple disarmament plans are mostly futile and dangerous. If this procedure of stipulating proportions is recognized by all countries and a system of arms inspection is implemented at the same time, it will be possible to substantially reduce the world's potential for war and avoid the competition of armaments. As for Britain accepting Germany's claim to a partial rearmament, its intention is to make Germany feel treated equally with other countries and to be satisfied. However, in the current negotiations, the United Kingdom will strive to reduce the limit of the so-called partial rearmament. In other words, partial rearmament must be a last resort. In addition, in order to maintain fairness, the United Kingdom will continue to provide reassurance to Germany's neighbors in terms of security and will never deny the legitimacy of France's security viewpoint. However, how the above-mentioned intentions will become active proposals will depend on the situation encountered in the capitals of the countries concerned. (Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>

<h3>Litvinov, Successful in Diplomacy, Hastens Home; Sends Telegram to Italian Prime Minister Expressing Goodwill</h3>
<p>(Washington) Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov arrived at Warsaw Station at 6:00 AM from Berlin. He did not meet with reporters and did not make a statement. Litvinov's train continued to the Niagoralaroi Station on the Soviet border at 7:00 AM and then transferred to Moscow. (Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Rome: Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov telegraphed Prime Minister Mussolini, expressing goodwill for the situation of his talks in Rome, saying that "the solid and long-lasting friendship between Italy and Russia has proven to be of great importance to world peace." (Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>
<h3>US-Italy-Russia Combination Has Japan as a Common Goal: Observations of a Spanish Newspaper</h3>
<p>Madrid: Libertad commented on Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov's visit to the United States and Italy, saying that "the United States, Italy, and Russia all have more or less sharp conflicts with Japan, or at least the possibility of conflicts." Therefore, it is not known whether Litvinov's visit to the United States and Italy is a preliminary arrangement for the three countries to form an alliance. The newspaper went on to explain the so-called "possibility of conflict between Italy and Japan," saying that Italy's economy is suffering serious damage from Japan's dumping policy. Moreover, "Japan used peaceful means to invade the African country of Abyssinia. Italy's diplomacy was willing to win, but unexpectedly failed in Abyssinia, which is what Italy is most angry about." (Note: Abyssinia is within Italy's sphere of influence. Recently, the Japanese have obtained cotton planting concessions in the country. The so-called peaceful means of invasion refers to this.)

<h3>Britain Formulates Steps to Expand Air Force; To Expand to Fifty-Two Squadrons in Four Years</h3>
<p>(London) According to news obtained by the political correspondent of the Morning Post, Aviation Minister Londonderry has taken various steps to strengthen Britain's air defenses. If a disarmament agreement is not forthcoming, Britain will build ten squadrons of aircraft within four years, increasing its air force to fifty-two squadrons. When the House of Lords discussed the issue of air armaments yesterday, Lord Londonderry said, "At present, countries have not engaged in reducing air armaments, so the air force plan formulated by Britain ten years ago cannot be indefinitely delayed. This plan is the minimum required for Britain's national defense." (Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) Aviation Minister Londonderry declared in the House of Lords today during the debate on Lord Aran's proposal to dismantle naval and military aircraft and transfer civilian aircraft to a world general agency, that the British government believes that it is difficult to implement the organization of an international air force under the command of the League of Nations and is unwilling to do so. The United States cannot contemplate building a supreme state in Geneva, and if so, the League of Nations must be fully equipped with naval and land forces. Does this mixed army have a chance of winning against a first-class country? If Geneva is bombed, we cannot stand by and watch the failure of the League of Nations. In any case, there must be a strong country that is not a member of the League of Nations. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>Belgium Consolidates Eastern Border Defense; Budget Passed by the Chamber of Representatives</h3>
<p>Brussels: Defense Minister Theunis gave an important speech in the Senate today, defending the government's national defense funding plan. This funding, totaling 75,000,000 Belgian francs, will be used to strengthen the defenses on the eastern border and increase the equipment of the wartime army. Theunis explained that Belgium has many concerns in terms of security. Recently, Switzerland increased its 1934 military budget to 91,200,000 Swiss francs, which is quite meaningful. Theunis continued to say that in the current international situation, it is necessary to increase the burden on the people. The Senate should accept this for the sake of Belgium's independence and honor. The entire right wing expressed its support, but the representative of the Socialist Party issued a declaration in the name of the party, saying that it would vote against the national defense funding plan. The Socialist Party demands that the government act resolutely to achieve universal disarmament among all countries and Germany. However, if Germany is determined to rearm, causing all efforts to fail, then Belgium should unite with all peace-loving nations to face Germany. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Belgium: The House of Representatives has concluded its discussion of the annual budget, and it has been passed by a vote of 87 to 68. In addition, the various clauses of the foreign affairs budget and the extraordinary national defense funding plan have also been passed successively. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>Smooth Progress in Anglo-French Negotiations; Trade War May Be Avoided</h3>
<p>(London) A trade war between England and France seems avoidable. Reuters has learned today that the current British government has no intention of retaliating against France's imposition of a 15% surtax and a 6% landing tax on British imports. The British government is satisfied with the progress of the Anglo-French negotiations over the past two weeks to seek a peaceful resolution, believing that the negotiations will not encounter obstacles. Furthermore, Britain does not want to embarrass the gradually stabilizing new French government. However, if negotiations fail, Britain will also increase taxes on French imports.

<h3>Matsuoka Yosuke Announces Withdrawal from Party and Resignation from Diet Seat; Abolition of Political Parties Given as Reason; Great Shock to the Seiyukai</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Matsuoka Yosuke issued a declaration today, announcing his withdrawal from the Seiyukai party and his resignation from his seat in the Diet. In his declaration, Matsuoka called for the abolition of all political parties in Japan, arguing that they hinder national unity during a time of national crisis. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Matsuoka Yosuke, the diplomatic hero created by the Japanese military, formally submitted his letter of resignation to Suzuki, the president of the Seiyukai party, at 10:00 AM today. His patriotic movement in cooperation with Nakajima Chikuhei (director of Nakajima Aircraft Company) and Nakano Seigo, Secretary-General of the Patriotic League, failed, and he is scheduled to leave Tokyo at 9:45 PM today to retire to his hometown in Yamaguchi Prefecture. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Matsuoka Yosuke's withdrawal from the Seiyukai party has caused a great shock in political circles, especially since the Seiyukai had used Matsuoka as a figurehead to promote active and independent diplomacy, resulting in a significant loss of face. However, the actual consequences are difficult to predict. Therefore, the party outwardly maintains a calm demeanor while secretly monitoring the actions of its members. (Dentsu dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Matsuoka's reason for leaving the party is the abolition of political parties. While some within the party may sympathize with the idea of strengthening party discipline and reforming the party internally, they find it difficult to immediately endorse the abolition of political parties. Even Representative Kobayashi, who has a special relationship with Matsuoka, has declared that he will never leave the party, indicating that the party will not be destabilized. Regarding Matsuoka's reasons for leaving, the Seiyukai's executive members are generally in agreement to approve his withdrawal. However, they will implement comprehensive plans to ensure the consolidation of party control in the future. Meanwhile, Speaker of the House of Representatives Akita has stated that the House will consult with the council regarding whether to approve Matsuoka's resignation during the next Diet session. (Nichiren dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Matsuoka Yosuke met with Suzuki, the president of the Seiyukai party, on the morning of the 8th and immediately returned to his residence. He then issued the following statement to reporters: "As a person who has always advocated the abolition of political parties, it is unreasonable for me to continue working for the Seiyukai. I have been deeply troubled since returning from Geneva. For this reason, the Seiyukai should also expel an unworthy person like myself from the party. This time, I am taking a free stance to carry out my work, and I have reached a corresponding conclusion to withdraw from the party. Therefore, I have submitted my application for withdrawal today through Representative Kobayashi to Secretary-General Yamaguchi. At the same time, to express my intentions, I paid a special visit to President Suzuki. The president earnestly urged me to stay in the Seiyukai and work for the country, and his words were extremely sincere. I also fully disclosed my feelings to seek understanding and expressed my gratitude for the friendship and goodwill I have received. Then I took my leave. I have also submitted my resignation from my position as a member of the House of Representatives. Since I was a publicly recognized candidate of the Seiyukai and am now withdrawing from the party, it is only natural for me to resign from my seat. However, I am by no means denying parliamentary politics. My view is that parliamentary politics can be exercised even without political parties, and that party politics is not suitable for the national conditions of Japan. The world is making various speculations about me in this regard, but I have not contacted anyone or engaged in any activities. In the future, I intend to thoroughly liquidate my past self. Now I am fortunate to be a completely naked person with empty hands, and I feel delighted to disclose the truth to the Japanese people. My concern lies here. This is not a political movement, but a spiritual movement. Therefore, I will never engage in fighting with political parties. Today, when I submitted my application for withdrawal, is a memorable day that I will never forget, because on this day last year, I attended the League of Nations to pay homage to the Emperor of the East and dropped a bombshell. A year has passed since then, and today I have become a free self and taken my newest first step. How can I express my feelings?" (Nichiren dispatch, 8th)</p>
<h3>Death of Naval Elder Statesman Yamamoto Gonnohyoe</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Naval Elder Statesman, Admiral Count Yamamoto Gonnohyoe, passed away at his residence in Takanawa, Shiba District, while receiving treatment for prostatic hypertrophy. His condition suddenly worsened on the morning of the 8th, and he became weak. At 6:30 PM, his pulse was faint, and he became unconscious. He passed away at 10:52 PM at the age of 82. He was born in Kagoshima in October of the fifth year of the Kaei era. In the third year of the Meiji era, he entered the Naval Academy. In the seventh year, he participated in the conquest of Taiwan and was appointed as a naval ensign. He rose through the ranks, and in the 37th year, he was promoted to admiral. During that time, he was dispatched to Europe and America. In the 31st year, he was appointed Minister of the Navy. In the 35th year, he was granted the title of baron. During the Russo-Japanese War, he served as Minister of the Navy, controlling military affairs. Due to his meritorious service, he was awarded the first rank, and in the 40th year, he was promoted to count. In the second year of the Taisho era, he served as Prime Minister. In the 12th year, he re-formed the cabinet and was awarded a great honorary title. Although he is currently in retirement, he is the founder of the Japanese Navy, and like the late Marshal Yamagata in the Army, he is one of Japan's most distinguished figures.

<h3>The Japanese Cabinet Faces Another Crisis; Araki's Strong Stance on Rural Countermeasures; Internal Affairs Conference May End Inconclusively</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the internal affairs cabinet meeting, Minister of War Araki has stated his determination to never allow a lenient resolution. In future meetings, the Minister of War's attitude will become even more assertive. While the Minister of War also supports the principle of self-reliance advocated by Finance Minister Takahashi, he believes that the current situation in rural areas, although not nationwide, cannot be resolved solely through self-reliance. From this viewpoint, Minister of War Araki feels considerable resonance with the plan of Minister of Agriculture Goto. At the first internal affairs conference before the budget cabinet meeting, the Minister of War submitted a written opinion to Prime Minister Saito. Because the contents of that opinion are similar to Goto's plan, Minister of War Araki and Finance Minister Takahashi will inevitably take opposing positions on how the internal affairs cabinet meeting proceeds. However, the Minister of War Araki's strong determination on this issue is not aimed at toppling the cabinet, but at upholding his beliefs. However, the result is bound to push the cabinet to the point of collapse. If the Finance Minister insists on self-reliance and refuses to compromise, the political crisis is likely to be unavoidable. (Dentsu dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The contents of the rural countermeasures plan distributed by Minister of War Araki at the fourth internal affairs conference are as follows: (1) To stabilize the lives of farmers, careful consideration must be given to the issue of debt reorganization and reduction. (2) To stabilize the prices of agricultural products, measures to maintain prices must be taken. (3) Protective policies must be considered to prevent the purchasing power of rural areas from fluctuating due to changes in the value of currency. (4) Rural countermeasures have a significant relationship to national defense. Therefore, rural countermeasures must be considered in conjunction with the national defense policy decided by the Five Ministers' Conference. These are further divided into emergency measures and permanent measures. Emergency measures should include a corresponding additional budget and should be implemented promptly. Permanent measures should be implemented after thorough investigation. (Dentsu dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Judging from the state of the reopened internal affairs conference, the initial enthusiasm of Minister of Agriculture Goto and others seems to have disappeared. Those involved are already pessimistic about the future, saying that rural countermeasures will be fruitless and the conference will end inconclusively. (Dentsu dispatch, 8th)</p>
<h3>US Committee of Pacific Institute Urges Attention to Pacific Issues</h3>
<p>(New York) The American Committee of the Pacific Institute has issued a statement claiming that the relationship between the United States and Pacific events has become increasingly close. Therefore, the lack of attention to Pacific nations in American education has become an increasingly important issue. According to a preliminary investigation by the committee, the space devoted to Far Eastern countries in history and geography textbooks averages less than 10%, and sometimes only 2%. Moreover, the content of these accounts is mostly objective and passive, emphasizing the point that the United States adheres to the truth in its relations with the Far East. As for the policy of rejecting Eastern ethnic groups, the economic necessities of the United States are cited as a matter of course, and there is very little discussion from the perspective of the interests of China or Japan themselves. Although there are signs of progress, especially in schools on the Pacific coast, where a great plan to study the Far East is being implemented. Finally, it is said that the content of textbooks is showing signs of major changes in the near future, but it is not appropriate to have a thorough discussion on the future of Pacific issues until the American Historical Association's Committee of Social Science Professors publishes its report, because the report will provide the necessary basis for determining which methods and scope are beneficial for teaching about the Far East.

<h3>"Japanese War Mania": American Magazine Publishes Article; Hirota Protests Against Anti-Japanese Sentiments</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The November issue of the well-known American magazine "Current History" published an article by Princeton University professor Denny, entitled "The Growing Mania for War in Japan," which is full of anti-Japanese sentiments. It fabricated a statement by Uchida Ryohei, president of the Japanese Production Party, as the opinion of Foreign Minister Hirota. The article states that "Foreign Minister Hirota said that if the United States intends to resolve Japanese-American relations, it should quickly repeal the immigration law and allow Japanese immigrants to enter the country. The United States must trust Japan's actions in Manchuria and not interfere. As for the Washington and London international conferences, they were war conferences under the guise of peace conferences, and their purpose was to subjugate Japan." Because Foreign Minister Hirota has never made such a statement, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that the magazine deliberately fabricated this report and has decided to order Consul General Horiuchi in New York to lodge a serious protest with the editor-in-chief of the New York Times, who is responsible for the magazine, and with Professor Denny.

<h3>The United States Achieves a Great Victory at the Pan-American Conference; Debt Problem Postponed; Mexico Plans to Fight Alone</h3>
<p>Montevideo The United States has achieved a great victory at the Pan-American Conference. The Steering Committee unanimously resolved today to temporarily shelve the issue of debts between American countries. This issue was the most contentious one that could jeopardize coordination within the conference. It will now be handled by the Inter-American High Commission, which will be held in the capital of Chile or Argentina next spring. It is also believed that Mexico's plan to establish an all-American bimetallic system will be shelved and may not be addressed at the conference. However, Mexican Foreign Minister Caso still has not given up on the fight for silver. (Guomin dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Montevideo Today, Uruguayan representative Marquez proposed to the Pan-American Conference that North and South American countries should impose a tariff truce until next June, and then reduce their tariffs to the average level of the past five years, in order to promote trade within the continent.

It is also heard that the Steering Committee is slightly supportive of Venezuela's proposal for the participating countries to conclude a gentleman's agreement, recognizing war as illegal. In addition, representatives from Paraguay and Bolivia have agreed to the conference organizing a subcommittee to study the serious situation in the Chaco region and have agreed to consider various efforts for peace within the conference.

<h3>Roosevelt Personally Mediates, Agricultural Department Internal Dispute Resolved</h3>
<p>(Washington) An internal dispute arose in the Agricultural Department, and Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau took steps to reduce the power of his subordinates, resulting in a divided administration. This afternoon, President Roosevelt specially invited all parties involved to the White House to personally mediate. Secretary of Agriculture Wallace told people that they all have the same goal, which is to ensure that farmers have adequate income. Morgenthau told people that secret events in the Treasury Department will no longer be managed by Undersecretary Hsu Shih, because the Secretary himself must have direct contact with the heads of each department in the ministry.

<p>(Washington) After a day of discussions at the White House, the internal dispute in the Agricultural Department has ended. Secretary Wallace has given rural administrator Peek a new position. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>Parliamentary Debate on Financial Bill; French Cabinet May Weather the Storm; Socialist Party Abandons Voting Rights</h3>
<p>(Paris) Today it was heard that the French Socialist Party members have decided to abandon voting rights for all fiscal bills. This move will secure a substantial majority in the House of Representatives for the Daudet cabinet, because the Socialist Party’s opposition to modifying tax proposals and reducing civil service wages were the main reasons that the previous two Daudet and Sarraut cabinets resigned. However, the debate on the fiscal bill within the National Assembly was fierce today. Legislator Peysson kept reiterating his proposed countermeasure and refused to leave the podium, which caused the speaker to announce an adjournment. (Guomin dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Lower House continues to debate the financial bill and cannot complete it tonight. It has now rejected the countermeasure proposed by the Socialist Party by a vote of 413 to 123 and has immediately begun to discuss the thirteen articles of the government bill.

<h3>Performance of "Pipa Ji" in Berlin Creates Quite a Stir</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Last night's performance of the ancient Chinese drama "Pipa Ji" at the Schumann Hall here was presented by the Nildel Student Opera Troupe, under the auspices of the German branch of the East Asia Art and Health Research Association. The performance of this play here has indeed caused quite a stir. Before arriving in Berlin, the opera troupe toured the world for two and a half years and was welcomed everywhere. It is heard that the first rehearsal of "Pipa Ji" was in Qingdao, and all the costumes were ancient Chinese theatrical costumes, thus clarifying many aspects of Chinese stage art. After the troupe's performance, the leader of the troupe reported on his tour around the world, and his account of the welcome he received in China was particularly moving. He also said that the initial purpose of the troupe's rehearsal of this play was to make people in his homeland understand that Germany and China actually have many points in common in terms of culture and thought.

<h3>Strange Animal Found in Scottish Sea; Over One Hundred Feet Long; Resembles a Whale with Four Legs</h3>
<p>(London) According to several people who are known for their integrity, an unusual animal, about 100 feet long, has been sighted in Loch Ness in recent weeks. Its shape is between that of a whale and an ancient reptile. The Scottish Secretary of State has now written to the Sheriff of Inverness-shire, asking him to take appropriate precautions and prohibit the netting, shooting, or harassment of the animal. Public opinion is greatly relieved. However, zoo officials, while having film of the animal, remain skeptical. According to the Sheriff's reply to the Scottish Secretary of State, he has dispatched police to patrol around Loch Ness to protect the animal. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>

<h3>Military Focus in Fujian Province Shifts to Northern Fujian: Liu Heding's Troops Prepare for Battle in Jian'ou, Tan Qixiu Builds Pillboxes in Yanping; Fujian Province to Launch Action in About a Week</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: Lu Xingbang, commander of the newly compiled Second Division stationed in Yong'an, Shaxian, Youxi, and Datian in Northern Fujian, has recently been appointed by the so-called People's Government as commander of the 15th Army, with the two brigade commanders of his department, Ye Xingjin and Tong Yonghan, promoted to division commanders, directly under the Military Council. Liu Heding, commander of the 56th Division of the Army stationed in Jian'ou, Jianyang, Songxi, and Zhenghe in Northern Fujian, has not yet been given any title by the so-called People's Government. However, both Liu Heding's and Tan Qixiu's troops are building pillboxes and repairing city walls in Jian'ou and Yanping, respectively, and both projects have now been completed. The importance of Yanping and Jian'ou in future military operations in Northern Fujian will increase. In recent days, the provincial authorities have transported a large quantity of military supplies to Yanping. It is reported that Deng Shizeng has completed his negotiations in the province and will go to Yanping within days to preside over military affairs. As for the Marine Corps stationed in Fujian, most of them are concentrated in Sandu Seaport, Fuding County, Eastern Fujian, under the command of Lin Bingzhou, who has sent troops to the tax offices in various counties of Fuding to extract taxes to supplement military funds. Chen Qixuan's troops, reorganized from the Security Brigade into the First Independent Brigade of the 19th Route Army, have recently moved from Gutian and Pingnan to Shouning and Fuxin in Fuding County, jointly defending with the Marine Corps. The Guangdong Army Huang Renhuan's division, originally stationed in Shanghang, Yongding, and Wuping counties in Western Fujian, has been withdrawn to the Guangdong border, and Zhang Yan's troops stationed in Longyan have sent troops to take over the defense. Looking at the current military situation in Fujian Province, the focus is on Northern Fujian, possibly entering Zhejiang via Jian'ou and Pucheng. Active arrangements are currently underway, and action will be launched as soon as the general offensive order is given. According to a source in a certain military organization, the latest it will be is about a week. However, the rumor circulating outside that the former head of the Public Security Bureau of the provincial capital, Qiu Zhaochen, will be appointed as the vanguard commander, leading six regiments to set out, is absolutely untrue. On December 1st, the Central Army sent three airplanes to Shaxian in Northern Fujian and Quanzhou in Southern Fujian, dropping bombs during the celebration meeting, causing several civilian casualties in Shaxian with nine bombs dropped, and more than ten civilian casualties and one soldier killed in Quanzhou with six bombs dropped. Yong'an and Datian only had airplanes flying over without dropping bombs, resulting in a tense atmosphere. The Mass Training Office of the Cultural Committee specially convened a representative assembly of all circles on the morning of the 4th at the committee's hall (i.e., the former provincial party headquarters) to discuss countermeasures, resolving to organize a people's self-defense association and raise funds to purchase air defense equipment. It was found that these airplanes all flew from Jian'ou. (December 5th)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Orders Two Divisions Stationed in Jiangxi to Return South: To Be Assigned to the East and West Rivers for Suppression; Qiongyai Garrison Brigade Also Returns to the Province; Chen Jitang Recruits Soldiers in the Southern Route</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Recently, the situation on the Fujian-Zhejiang border has become tense, and the attitude of Guangxi Province is also very ambiguous. Guangdong is located between Fujian and Guangxi, so border defenses have suddenly become serious. According to news from the front, about 10,000 troops from the 62nd and 49th divisions of the 19th Route Army have been found in Pinghe County and other areas in Southern Fujian. Li Yangjing, commander of the 3rd Army, arrived in Meixian yesterday to discuss the front's deployment with the generals there. Deng Longguang, commander of the Independent 4th Division, has also gone to the Huizhou area to arrange a second line of defense in the eastern district. The 5th Division, under Li Zhenliang, originally stationed in Heyuan and Zijin counties, has moved towards Meixian. Zhang Wentao's 3rd Independent Regiment, directly under the headquarters, also set out from Shantou yesterday to Raoping to cooperate with Zhang Ruigui's Independent 2nd Division in guarding the border. Although there are currently more than 20 regiments in the Chaozhou-Meizhou area, the authorities, to take into account other aspects, have recently ordered the 2nd Division of the 1st Army, under Ye Zhao, and the 4th Division of the 2nd Army, under Zhang Da, stationed in Southern Jiangxi, to move south from San'nan, Xinfeng, An Yuan, and other places, to be assigned to the East and West Rivers for suppression. It is said that Zhang Da's division will take the route through Wengyuan, directly to Lianping and Heping, and then to Xingning, to support Chaozhou-Meizhou as a reserve force for the front armies. As for the defense area of Xinfeng, it will be filled by Li Zhenqiu's 1st Division of the 1st Army in Southern Jiangxi, transferring the defense area of Nankang, which will be the responsibility of Chen Zhang's Independent 2nd Brigade and He Lianfang's regiment in Shangyou. The Shangyou defense will be transferred by Liang Rongqiu's regiment stationed in Yingqian. As for Yingqian and other places in Western Jiangxi, they will be taken over by Wang Dongyuan's division of the Hunan Army. It is reported that the 2nd and 4th divisions are expected to depart around the 8th. It is also reported that the guard brigade under Chen Hanguang and the regiment under Huang Guoliang, stationed in the Southern Route, have also been ordered to return to the province to await orders. After receiving the order, Huang's regiment took a ship from Hainan to the province on the 3rd, and is expected to arrive around the 6th. As for the urban area of Guangzhou, a key area of the provincial capital, in addition to the strict maintenance of public order by the military police and security teams, the training division is responsible for guarding the suburbs. The 1st and 3rd regiments of the division are stationed along the northeast suburbs of Longyandong, Yantang, Sanyuanli, Xiaogang, and Shangpanyu, while the 4th regiment is stationed in Huangpu Butterfly Hill and other places. Amidst this hectic troop mobilization, the authorities have intensified the recruitment of idle laborers. On the 1st Army's side, as the 2nd and 4th divisions are about to return to Guangdong, it has yesterday ordered the counties of Southern Jiangxi to recruit 100 idle laborers per county to be available for dispatch. The recruitment method is that idle laborers will serve for three months at a time, rotated to ensure equal labor and leisure. The salaries for idle laborers are 16 yuan per month, with 6 jiao for straw shoes, paid monthly. The 1st Group Army headquarters, in order to replenish the armies, yesterday specially telegraphed the 17 counties under the jurisdiction of Gaozhou, Leizhou, Qinzhou, and Lianzhou in the Southern Route, ordering them to recruit 500 new soldiers per county within a short period of time. All recruitment expenses will be paid by the respective county governments, and forced recruitment is not allowed to avoid disturbances. The counties have begun recruitment upon receiving the order, and it is expected that 8,500 people will be recruited soon and sent to the province for training in preparation for allocation or distribution to various armies for replenishment.

<h3>Zhang Qun's Discussion on the Current Situation: The Fujian Rebellion Can Be Easily Resolved, the Central Government Has Already Decided on a Major Plan; The Guangdong Government's Formation and the Shanghai Preliminary Meeting Are Both Rumors; The Central Government Is Preparing to Implement Constitutional Governance Without Waiting for Suggestions; The Advocacy of Separatist Rule Only Benefits Private Interests and Harms the Country</h3>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: Zhang Qun, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, was summoned to Beijing by President Wang due to the outbreak of the Fujian Rebellion to jointly decide on a major plan. He returned west by boat on the 1st of this month, arriving in Xunyang on the 3rd, and then went to Nanchang to visit Chiang. On the 5th, he accompanied He Jingwu, Chairman of the Pinghan Railway Committee, to Xunyang, and on the 6th, they returned to Hankou together on the Xianghe ship, arriving at 7:00 AM on the 7th. That afternoon, he issued a statement on the current situation, which stated, "The rebellion in Fujian Province was caused by a group of reactionary elements. The theory is extremely absurd, and the facts are even more ridiculous. Upon examining the figures in the puppet government, there are so-called Social Democrats, the Third Party, Communist Party liquidationists, Nationalists, etc., all mixed together. The Communist bandit Peng Dehuai also went to Fuzhou several times to attend meetings. The elements are complex, the opinions are divided, and the strength is weak, and the finances are difficult. Therefore, the result of their rebellion against the Party and the country is to invite their own destruction. Moreover, the rebels call themselves the Republic of China Production Democratic Republic and the so-called People's Government, which is also extremely absurd in name. Their changing of the era name and system is entirely based on the private intentions of a few people. What does it have to do with the people, and what does it have to do with the agricultural and industrial workers? To call themselves this is truly shameless. The central government has now decided on a plan for prompt and severe handling, and all parties have expressed indignation, hoping that the central government will resolve it as soon as possible. The troops of Liu Heding, Lu Xingbang, Zhou Ziqun, and others are still staying in Fujian, expressing their support for the central government. Outside rumors say that there has been contact on the Fujian-Zhejiang border, but this is not confirmed. However, the central government's deployment is strict, and the date of resolution will be near. The Fourth Plenary Session will be held as scheduled, and the Central Committee members staying in Guangdong should come to Beijing to attend. Guangdong absolutely does not approve of the Fujian Rebellion. The attitude can be seen from the Southwest Executive Department's telegram. Outside rumors of organizing a third government are purely rumors. Also, there is no such proposal to hold a preliminary meeting of the Fourth Plenary Session in Shanghai first. Zhang Ji's departure south was not seen in a clear order when I left Beijing, but the atmosphere was strong, so it is likely to happen. As for some people suggesting shortening the period of political tutelage in order to implement constitutional governance, the central government has already been actively preparing for this matter. A draft of the constitution is being drafted, and it is also planned to allocate one million or two million yuan to build a National Assembly hall that can accommodate more than 2,500 people. Therefore, in fact, there is no need to wait for suggestions. I also heard that some people advocate separate rule and cooperation. This kind of propaganda is probably harboring private intentions. Those who cause trouble are afraid that the world will not be chaotic, only seeking personal gain and not caring about the interests of the country and the nation. The situation in North China is extremely stable. Zhang Xueliang is prepared to return home. Wang Shuhan and Wan Fulin met in Nanchang, and the day before yesterday, they traveled to Xunyang and then to Beijing in the same car as me, only staying for a day or two before returning north. The military campaign to suppress bandits in Jiangxi Province is proceeding smoothly, and the blockade policy is particularly effective. The supply of materials in the bandit areas has been completely cut off, and those who surrender with weapons are constantly arriving. Chiang Kai-shek believes that the Fujian incident can be easily resolved, so he continues to stay in Jiangxi to supervise the suppression and clear the bandits as soon as possible. Chiang and Wang are both paying close attention to the aftermath of the bandit areas and the restoration of the countryside, and have decided to allocate 600,000 yuan from the central government for the use of treating the aftermath of Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, and Anhui provinces. The aftermath in the border areas of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui is underway and is still under the responsibility of Liu Zhenhua. The other day, my boat passed Anqing, and Liu met me on the Yongfeng warship to discuss this matter. However, there has been no news about Liu being appointed as the Special Commissioner for the aftermath in the border areas of the three provinces. In Beijing, in addition to visiting President Wang, I also discussed with Minister Wang Shijie the revitalization of education, and with Minister Kong Xiangxi the reorganization of finances. In Shanghai, I discussed with Song Ziwen the subsidies for the construction of highways. Furthermore, due to the destruction of Hubei Province and the suffering of the people, I specially invited various groups in Shanghai to organize a visiting delegation to inspect Hubei, so that they could witness the suffering and find ways to relieve and rehabilitate the refugees. I also promoted to the Shanghai business and financial circles, requesting them to invest in Hubei Province to engage in industries and develop it. Friends in both circles have expressed their agreement. Hubei Province is the center of industry and commerce in the country, and for the sake of the entire country, it is necessary to invest in it, not only to prosper Hubei Province itself. Regarding provincial affairs, I have suggested that the provincial government office should be jointly managed, and Chiang Kai-shek has distributed it to various provinces for review. Now, they have submitted separate replies, and Chiang will gather them into a general opinion and reconsider and determine it. Whether or not this province will implement it depends entirely on Chiang's orders." (7th)</p>
<h3>Xuzhou's Measures for Dealing with Private Banknotes: Reorganize and Clean Up the Banknote Committee, Detain Those in Charge of Banknote Shops Pending Investigation</h3>
<p>Xuzhou Dispatch: The seven private banknote shops, including Xupu Gongyu, have been ordered to stop cashing in banknotes since the 2nd of this month, with the approval of the county government. The Cleanup Committee has resolved to fully cash in the banknotes within a period of one month. However, the current social situation is already difficult to maintain, and there is no definite method for the future cleanup and aftermath. Moreover, with the end of the year approaching, the market is showing signs of great panic. There are many banknotes stored in the countryside, and there are various problems. The county government specially convened various agencies, groups, and impartial gentry on the afternoon of the 6th to discuss specific post-disaster measures for implementation. More than 50 people attended, chaired by County Magistrate She Nianci. From 2:00 PM to 7:00 PM, they conducted a full day of discussion and established the following plan: (1) Regarding the case of detaining those in charge of the banknote shops, it was resolved to detain the persons in charge and their direct family members of Chunquan, Juhechang, Buxinji, Shixingchang, Yizhenxiang, and Tianbaoyu, six shops, and the persons in charge must be shackled and imprisoned. (2) Regarding the case of sealing up the assets of the banknote merchants, it was resolved to: 1. Seal up the assets reported and registered by them; 2. Thoroughly investigate whether there are other real estate and movable properties and seal them up together; 3. Order the banknote merchants to issue a signed statement of "willing to be severely punished if there are any concealed assets"; 4. Announce the amount of assets and use the estimated price as the standard. (3) Regarding the case of reorganizing the Banknote Cleanup Committee, it was resolved to: 1. Organize it with eleven agencies; 2. Recommend the County Party Department, County Government, Farmers' Association, Chamber of Commerce, Education Association, Public Security Bureau, Education Bureau, First District Office, Property Office, Relief Institute, and Reporters' Association as cleanup committee members, to be convened by the County Party Department; 3. The heads of each agency must attend the meeting; 4. The resolutions of the Cleanup Committee shall be executed by the County Government. (4) Regarding how to cash in the banknotes, it was resolved to: 1. Request the Provincial Government to designate the Provincial Bank to issue circulation vouchers to replace and recover the banknotes; 2. Recommend representatives from the County Party Department, Farmers' Association, and Chamber of Commerce to go to the province to appeal, and also request Provincial Committee Member Wu and County Magistrate She to go to the province together to make a personal statement; 3. The circulation vouchers shall be guaranteed by the assets of the banknote merchants and the accumulated additional taxes owed by the Property Office; 4. The reserve fund for the circulation vouchers shall be partially assumed by the Provincial Government and the Provincial Bank, and the other part shall be borrowed and pledged from local wealthy merchants using the assets of the banknote merchants. (5) Regarding the case of ordering Gongyu to fully cash in banknotes, it was resolved to: 1. Clearly order the shareholders of Gongyu to bear unlimited liability; 2. If the shareholders of Gongyu expose any malpractice by the directors and managers, they shall be investigated and severely punished; 3. Order them to fully cash in the banknotes by January 2023. If they violate the deadline, the persons in charge and shareholders will be treated in the same way as the persons in charge of the other six banknote shops. After the announcement of this plan, the county government immediately implemented it separately. The banknote merchants did not expect the measures to be so strict. Given this urgent situation, perhaps the banknote merchants themselves, for the sake of their own assets and out of the impossible, will find a way to come up with a way out. The banknote holders may be able to suffer less of a loss, and it will also preserve a lot for the local area. (7th)</p>
<h3>Xiangxiang County, Hunan Province Opposes Increasing the Head Tax, Because It Violates the Central Government's Regulations and Increases the Burden on the People</h3>
<p>Changsha Dispatch: The field taxes in various counties of Hunan Province have always been uneven, and the head tax surcharge is even more inconsistent. Recently, the provincial government ordered all counties to uniformly add a head tax of five yuan per tael, ostensibly to equalize the burden, but in fact, the surtax was increased in more than 30 counties and decreased in more than 40 counties. Among them, Xiangxiang County has increased by more than 100,000 yuan per year. Representatives of the county, such as Chuan Dingxiang, believe that this move by the provincial government not only violates the central government's order that the surcharge should not exceed twice the regular contribution, but also intends to transform the surcharge into a regular contribution and transform the temporary into permanent, which is difficult to recognize. Therefore, they jointly resisted with various counties. The text of their telegram is recorded below to show the truth:</p>
<p>"To the public legal groups and newspaper offices in Hunan Province, and to the elders of Xiangxiang residing outside the province: Recently, this association submitted a telegram to the central government and the ministries and commissions of the National Government, stating: 'Recently, the Hunan Provincial Government issued the General Outline of the Security Plan for the First District, which states that each county's head tax surtax is set at five yuan per tael and collected from 23 years onwards. Calculating based on Xiangxiang's existing 41,800 taels, with a head tax surcharge of 2.5 yuan per tael, it already exceeds 100,000 yuan. The people are already burdened with a thousand pounds, and have no way to cry out. Now, suddenly doubling it, will Xiangxiang's 1.3 million people be completely placed in exile and despair? As representatives of the people, at this critical moment of life and death, we have to earnestly advise you. Field tax surcharges cannot exceed the regular contribution, the central government has long issued a clear order, and recently Chiang Kai-shek's Nanchang headquarters also telegraphed to all parties, stating that the first rule is that field taxes cannot be increased without authorization. However, our provincial counties have suddenly increased the head tax surcharges, which is alarming. A public document has caused the people to shoulder an additional financial burden of hundreds of thousands of yuan, disregarding the orders of the central government and turning a blind eye to the suffering of the people. This is something that the people of Xiangxiang will swear not to recognize. First, Xiangxiang's field tax, since the Ming Dynasty's Emperor Taizu blamed the people of Xiangxiang for helping Chen Youliang with grain, resulting in a sudden increase of more than 108,000 taels of field tax throughout the county. Although it was gradually reduced during the Qing Dynasty, more than 41,800 taels still remain today. Hunan, except for Hengyang, which was originally merged from the two counties of Hengyang and Qingquan and has more than 10,000 taels more than Xiangxiang, Xiangxiang is the most. Because the quota is heavy, the local legal groups and chambers of commerce are very cautious about the amount of surcharges, even between fractions of a cent. For decades, the local financial vitality has been able to avoid reaching a state of complete chaos and destruction. Now, the provincial government is cutting flesh to heal sores, urgently choosing to put the people of Xiangxiang to death. This is something that the people of Xiangxiang will swear not to recognize. Second, the head tax is originally a local self-defense force, which is different from the provincial and national defense forces. It is only right and proper to use the money provided by the people to protect the interests of the people themselves. Moreover, maintaining local order is the same as maintaining a province and a country. However, the provincial government, due to the weakness of the provincial defense military force, uses its ingenious mind and the highest pressure, first changing the household head tax to a security head tax, directly appointing officials, then checking the head tax surcharge, inspecting the firearms, then transferring and stationing remote counties, mixing the formations, then repeated requests from the local bandits and police to transfer back a part of the team to suppress the disturbance were all answered with 'no need to discuss'. Fifth, the annual payment of more than 100,000 yuan of head tax does not win the name of 'collaborative funding'. Recently, they have boasted of reducing 2 million yuan throughout the province, but in reality, they have increased Xiangxiang by more than 100,000 yuan. In other words, the team is incorporated into the provincial army, the head tax guns become provincial guns, the surcharge becomes a regular contribution, and the self-defense force of the majority of the people becomes a tool of power for a few soldiers. In simple terms, Xiangxiang secretly sends 100,000 yuan to the government for the first time and it is not enough, and it will not be satisfied until it sends another 100,000 yuan. Try to think for Xiangxiang, what have the people done to wrong the government, and what hatred does the government have for the people? It is already unbearable to bear the burden of this huge sum of money that cannot protect the locality, and it is already unjustifiable to complain. How can we silence ourselves and allow the government to make endless demands? This is something that the people of Xiangxiang will swear not to recognize. Third, Xiangxiang's rural economy has reached a state of no assets to break. This year's so-called national salvation public bonds, taking advantage of the people's gasping, were absorbed and distributed by force, reaching 78,000 yuan, plus the field tax surcharge calculated to more than 230,000 yuan, and with the addition of more than 100,000 yuan, it will increase to 340,000 to 350,000 yuan. The remaining national and provincial regular and miscellaneous taxes have not yet been totaled. Think about this county with many mountains and few fields, and people with no other production, the government does not plan to find a way out and develop the economy, but only focuses on increasing taxes every day. Taking from the people without any rest, how can the people bear their fate? This is something that the people of Xiangxiang will swear not to recognize. Fourth, in the previous term, the provincial government sent personnel to the county due to the lack of funding for local autonomy, ostensibly to reduce the surcharge, but in reality, they were cutting off the surcharge in the A area to make up for the loss in the B area, and only reduced one dime out of the local surcharge of seven dimes, which hindered public welfare matters, while the head tax was not damaged in the slightest. However, the provincial government absolutely did not allow and criticized the few surcharges for autonomy that the people had been hoping to develop and for maintaining vocational schools. If the people seek a dime that is beneficial to the locality, the government forbids it without hesitation. If the people think it is painful and not beneficial to the locality, the government adds several yuan, and does not hesitate to violate the will of the people and disregard the difficulties of the people, only following the will of a few people and disregarding the interests of the majority of the people. This is something that the people of Xiangxiang will swear not to recognize. Fifth, the amount of field tax in various counties of Hunan Province is the lightest in remote counties. There are also those who have not been actually levied due to the change of land to flow, and there are also those who have returned later and have been treated generously. At this time, the land has not been measured, and the tax has not been reformed. There is no standard for unevenly distributed. What does the so-called reduction of 2 million yuan of head tax refer to and how can it be said to be true? Even if there is such a huge amount to be reduced, why should Xiangxiang be increased by more than 100,000? Others, such as the neighboring Hengyang, Ningxiang, Xiangtan, Xiangyin, Anhua, and Leiyang counties, are increased by 60,000 or 70,000 and 40,000 or 50,000. Extending to the whole, it is enough to show that there is an increase without reduction, to sell the name of reduction and do the act of increasing, to deceive the central government and confuse the public. This is something that the people of Xiangxiang will swear not to recognize. Sixth, the provincial government has already passed and implemented the reward and punishment method for sorting out the head tax, and Article 4 states that if the county magistrate, agencies, groups, and people of each county have any acts of resisting, delaying, obstructing, or violating the situation, once they are investigated and confirmed, the security headquarters will submit a request to the provincial government for separate punishment. The county magistrates of each county dare not disobey the order, and the people dare not listen obediently. However, Sun Yat-sen once showed us that there is people's rights and veto power. It seems that only knowing how to exploit the people's wealth and being manipulated by a few people to control the judicial and legislative systems, trying to silence the public, put the necks to the chopping block, the oppression is more than the monarch, and the lives of the people are as light as grass. Then the government is opposing the people, not the people resisting the government. With this creed, all the people are united. This is something that the people of Xiangxiang will swear not to recognize. Seventh, in short, the central government is the highest guide and power holder for the people, and it is also the last comfort and rescuer for the people. For this case of sorting out the head tax in Hunan Province, which is deceiving the top and misleading the bottom and the name does not match the reality, we earnestly request that an order be issued to immediately cancel and stop the execution. Otherwise, the people cannot bear their fate, the lives of the people have no support, and looking forward to the future, there will be unimaginable consequences. Presenting this with fear, blood and tears flow together, and we hope that the leader who is highly respected in the party and the country will understand it. We respectfully present it, and we hope that you will support it unanimously, and we will be grateful. All the public legal groups of Xiangxiang County bowed in unison.'"</p>
<h3>Archaeological Work in Southern Shandong Concludes: Dong Zuobin and Others to Return to Jinan in the Coming Days; Painted Stones Discovered in a Northern Ming Dynasty Han Tomb</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The archaeological work at Anshang Village, Teng County, and the Cao Wang Tomb has now concluded. A total of 43 pits were opened in Anshang Village, and various pottery shards, bones, and other objects were collected. The rough washing and numbering have been completed, and they can be loaded into approximately 20+ boxes. Fifteen tomb pits and six stone sarcophagi were excavated from the Cao Wang Tomb. Twenty-five Han Dynasty painted stones, removed from the walls of the San Guan Temple, were escorted to Teng County by Pan Ke on the first of this month and temporarily stored at the No. 1 Primary School in the North Pass District. After the personnel excavating ancient artifacts from Anshang Village gather in Teng, they will all come to Jinan together. Wangfenyu, to the west of the Anshang Site (Guduidin), had three pits previously dug, but after examination, it was deemed to have no great promise and was stopped. Pan Ke went to Northern Ming the day after arriving in Teng (2nd). Northern Ming is located more than 30 li north of Sheng. In the spring of this year, a Han tomb was discovered, which was also a stone sarcophagus. Its internal structure is similar to the stone sarcophagus of Cao Wang's tomb. The locals of Northern Ming call the tomb structure an oil basket shape. It is also a stone building, but the stone carvings of the stone sarcophagus are more exquisite than those of Cao Wang's tomb. When it was discovered, it was heard by the local gentry Huang Futang, who went to inspect it and confirmed that it was a Han Dynasty painted stone, and then transported several pieces to be temporarily stored at the No. 1 Primary School in the North Pass District. Before Dong Zuobin and others went to Southern Shandong for archaeological work this time, they also inspected it once. Now that the work on Cao Wang's tomb has ended, Pan Ke was ordered to go to that place to continue searching along the original tomb site, and found four more Han painted stones at the bottom of the tomb. One of them is a long strip, with a fishing scene engraved on it. At the front end are four people pulling a towline, followed by a boat. Behind the helmsman, there are those who release fishing eagles, those who spread nets, and those who catch fish. The total length is about one meter and the width is about three or four inches, making it the most complete and rare Han painted stone obtained this time. There are also many pottery shards, two with coin patterns, and fifty-five five-baht coins. Pan Ke took a copy of each of the painted stones found at the bottom of the tomb, and brought the pottery shards and five-baht coins to Teng County on the afternoon of the 3rd, waiting for Dong Mou and others to arrive before returning to Jinan together.</p>
<p>Liu Ziheng, a student from Shandong University in Qingdao, participated in the archaeological work this time and has now left Teng and returned to Qingdao. According to Liu, he had just returned to school after completing the examination of Ji Wangcheng. Ji Wangcheng is located about 70 li east of Teng County, with the Yi Mountain to the north, the Small Green Mountain to the south, the mountains and hills to the east, and the Great Plain to the west. It is surrounded by 20 li, and there are three villages inside. Its city walls are of plank construction and are more exquisite than Xuecheng. The ancient artifacts found on the ground include pottery shards from the Spring and Autumn Period, more than a dozen of which were collected this time, as well as one li-foot (leg of tripod cauldron) and one broken dou (pedestal cup) stem. On the way from Tieshan to Zou County, five ancient bricks were picked up in the valley, with patterns on them, including horses and arrowheads, similar to the arrowheads unearthed at the Anshang site, etc. (6th)</p>
<p>Inspection Record of Jiangxi, Anhui, Hunan, and Hubei Provinces, Special Correspondent Ren An</p>
<h3>From Nanzhang via Jingmen to Zhongxiang</h3>
<p>A communication from Zhongxiang: When I was about to leave Nanzhang, I went to bid farewell to County Magistrate Zeng. He inquired about my impressions of Nanzhang. I briefly told him that the merits were the extensive irrigation and the diligence and simplicity of the people, while the demerits were the opium scourge and foot-binding, which urgently needed to be eradicated thoroughly. He replied, "Among the demerits, there is still one item missing: the bandits in remote areas have not yet been pacified. Currently, the governing plan of our county, in terms of negative aspects, is to eliminate these three demerits entirely. However, it is not possible to achieve success immediately, and I really feel the difficulty of 'three mores' and 'three lesses'." What does this mean? It means that although the county magistrate is nominally a local official, due to the abundance of orders, instructions, and regulations from superiors, and the scarcity of government funds, staff, and ammunition, every undertaking to promote benefits and eliminate evils faces objective resistance. If it is not fearing hitting the mouse and breaking the vase, it is the worry of "seeing the elbow". Under these circumstances, I can only hold the thought that "success depends on human effort" and strive to do my best. If I sow melons, I will reap melons, and I believe there will be corresponding results." These few words can be said to have fully revealed the crux of the position of ordinary county magistrates and the pathological state of their minds.</p>
<p>Traveling to Yicheng, I took a car south. Passing a small station, seven passengers boarded, each carrying heavy packages. Upon inspection, it was found that they were all cash. An assistant driver, knowing what business they were in, casually asked, "How much is the price of the goods you sell?" One person replied, "It's a losing business. The selling price is only one yuan and six jiao." He asked again, "The original price in Sichuan is said to be only two or three mao, and you gentlemen don't take the main road (meaning Wuhan or Laohekou). With such a good price, how can you still lose money?" The merchant replied, "Although the original price is only three jiao, and no formal special tax has been paid, passing through Kaixian, every load (weighing sixty or seventy jin) had to pay 200 yuan of tax for leaving the province, 100 yuan of miscellaneous taxes. Although the local defense corps does not have a written fee, every load also has to be levied 100 liang of goods. When entering Hubei, passing through the secluded paths in the mountains, it is also necessary to reward the local defense for escorting. This trip has a total of eight large and small taxes, with each liang of goods costing one yuan and one jiao in tax. Adding the cost, it is one yuan and four jiao. Now selling it for one yuan and six jiao, and having gone through countless hardships, how can it not be a losing business?" While talking, suddenly more than a hundred people with disheveled clothes, holding guns and knives, appeared. The situation was turbulent. They lined up on the roadside. When the car arrived, they suddenly fired two shots and shouted to stop the car. The reporter guessed that they were bad elements. Looking around at the merchants, their faces were pale as dirt. They hid their packages under their seats. The driver stopped the car in response. Upon inquiry, it was learned that they were a nearby anti-communist militia. They had just dispersed after a meeting in a mountain temple. The crowd surrounded two or three of their gray-haired leaders, claiming they wanted to hitch a ride for a short distance. After the old men got off the car, some said that they were a disguised form of the Gelaohui. Before long, dark clouds gathered, and heavy rain suddenly came. The car arrived in Jingmen, but stopped and did not proceed. There are quite a few troops stationed in Jingmen, and the division headquarters is also located here. However, even fifteen li outside the city, there is still occasional fear of banditry. Regarding the hardships of the people, there are two points that can be credibly confirmed. One is that for the land occupied by the highways and county roads, the original owners have already suffered losses from land donation and still have to pay taxes. They have repeatedly requested exemption, but have not achieved their goal, and their pain and sighs cannot be described in words. The second is that in May of this year, the former county magistrate, due to the lack of militia funds, obtained the consent of local organizations to issue 30,000 yuan of "mu donation offset vouchers" to maintain operations, and ordered all districts to announce to the public that paying the "mu donation" could use the vouchers. However, when collecting taxes this autumn, the current county magistrate suddenly issued a notice stating that the offset vouchers could only be used to pay last year's "mu donation", while this year's "mu donation" must be paid in cash. But in fact, last year's "mu donation" was mostly paid off. If it wasn't, they would not have the power to purchase the offset vouchers. Those who could afford the voucher are definitely not the old grain debtors. If they cannot pay this year's autumn tax, wouldn't the offset vouchers they obtained with cash become worthless paper? This matter not only increases the burden on the people but also damages the government's credibility. The people have elected representatives to request prompt correction, but it has been a long time and there has been no concrete result. The current county magistrate, Fang Yi, in his spare time, has quite a belief in Buddhism. Next to his office, there is also a Buddhist hall. With such good intentions, everyone expects that the correction of the offset voucher case will be beneficial to the people. The next morning, I went east to Zhongxiang and spoke with people from all sides. I learned that the rural economy of the county has a concentrated land ownership, forming a manor system. Five years ago, there were many people who owned up to 50,000 mu of land. Later, due to banditry, they tried their best to sell it. Up to now, there are still several families with tens of thousands of mu. Tenant farmers account for 80% of the total number of farmers. The farming situation is purely northern style, mostly producing miscellaneous grains, especially in the northern mountains, where wheat is the main crop. The south is adjacent to Tianmen, the center of cotton production, so cotton is also widely produced. The old town of Jiukou, fifty li from the city, is a major market for the gathering and distribution of cotton. In the past, merchants from Sichuan and Shaanxi dealing in cotton cloth gathered here, but later it was captured by bandits and severely damaged. Now, those who newly arrive in the area cannot even find a hotel. Near the village, there is a place called Xuejiaqiao, where bandits turned the people into bandits, and as many as two thousand people were killed. The scene is so desolate that one cannot bear to look at it.</p>
<p>The transportation in Zhongxiang is well-developed because the land is mostly plains, and roads were diligently repaired during the suppression of bandits to facilitate military transportation. The county roads are well-developed, surpassing neighboring areas. In recent years, banditry has been suppressed, and car transport has decreased. There are even several roads where cars have never traveled. Generally, ignorant farmers, either because their land is close to the roadside, or because the highway originally belonged to their land, take the opportunity to imitate each other, arbitrarily digging up the road base, merging it into their own fields, and cultivating it. If this is not immediately prohibited and strictly protected, it is feared that in five or six years, it will be completely encroached upon. This not only means that the great project that was painstakingly built will be reduced to nothing, but also a great loss in terms of the impact on transportation.</p>
<h3>Qingpu County Government Executes Seven Bandits by Firing Squad</h3>
<p>The bandits Jin A'yun and others had committed numerous crimes in this county. They were captured by the Sixth and Twelfth District Defense Corps in March of this year. They confessed to forming gangs, looting, kidnapping villagers, extorting huge sums of money, and cruelly killing hostages. The victims came to the county government to identify them. The county government considered that the bandits' crimes were serious and that severe punishment was necessary to serve as a warning. Therefore, the bandits were sentenced to death and reported to the provincial government for approval. On the 4th of this month, the county government received a telegram from the province stating that the seven bandits Jin A'yun, Zu Rongchang, Niu Aqi, Shen Fubao, Jiang Laohu, Chen Deyan, and Le Jinxiang were approved to be executed. The county magistrate was ordered to carry out the execution immediately and report back. After receiving the telegram, the county magistrate summoned the bandits at 7 a.m. on the 5th, verified their identities, and escorted them to the execution ground outside the West Gate to be executed by firing squad.</p>
<h3>Southeast Township School of Jiangyin Complies with Orders to Hand Over Control</h3>
<p>The provincial government ordered the county to take over the Southeast Township School and the West Township Public Office, but it was not completed. The executive committee members were detained, and representatives from each township went to the provincial government to petition. Now, the provincial government's Department of Education has formulated a compromise solution. On the 6th, a telegram was sent to County Magistrate Ruan, ordering him to comply and use the funds from the Southeast Township School to prepare for the establishment of the Jiangyin County Southeast Township Junior Vocational School, so that the children of the 26 townships in the southeast can attend school without paying tuition fees. After receiving the telegram, County Magistrate Ruan, in addition to forwarding the order to the Southeast Township School, personally went to take over at 2 p.m. The executive committee members Chen Zhongda and Zhu Zhaokui first handed over the seals. At the same time, County Magistrate Ruan sent a telegram to the provincial government to report. The West Township Public Office also complied with the order to hand over control, planning to set up a farm. The executive committee members Chen and Mao were immediately released.</p>
<h3>Provincial Committee of Changzhou Secretly Investigates Drugs in Changzhou</h3>
<p>Inspector Zhao Shu (Zi Gongwang) of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, when he came to Changzhou for inspection last time, received a secret report that the sales of opium pills in Wujin were very large, sold in the Yili area. After Zhao returned to Changzhou, he went to Yili for inspection and then returned to the province to report. He had a face-to-face meeting with Chairman Chen, who allowed him to bring two staff members to Changzhou to investigate the opium pill institution. Zhao arrived at Benniu by car on the 6th, then took a car to Changzhou, using an alias to stay in a hotel. He asked the waiter for red pills and opium to smoke. On the morning of the 7th, together with Xu Baoguang, the director of the Public Security Bureau, they found opium pills and other items on Zhang Baomin's body at No. 20 Zhenjue Temple. They also found smoking paraphernalia, Wang Xilin's Yun soil, and heroin on Xu Wang's body. They immediately took the witnesses to the bureau. Zhao's staff member, who was staying at the Tongshang Hotel, ordered the waiter to buy heroin. He bought it immediately and was taken to the bureau. Chen Fubao was also arrested on Xianzhi Street. All were interrogated in the Public Security Bureau. There was also a reporter named Shi Zonghan, who was found impersonating someone, was also arrested. Inspector Zhao returned to the province that night to report.</p>
<h3>Changshu Miaoquan Robbery Case Continues to Catch Major Thieves</h3>
<p>The home of Zhang Haijin in Miaoquan Town, the second district of this county, was robbed on the 5th of last month. In addition to the loss of items, there was also a one-thousand-yuan draft from the Tongyi Bank. Zhang immediately reported the loss to the bank. It was discovered on the 15th of last month that someone was still presenting the business card of Zhu Xian, the former head of the security team, to cash it. The Public Security Bureau's detective team found out that the card was stolen. Based on this clue, a female suspect, Xu Meimei, was arrested. The day before yesterday, after an investigation, it was learned that the principal offender, Xia Desheng (Da Mao), was hiding in Kunshan. Detective Xie Desheng and Ding Songliang were dispatched. It was learned that he had been transferred to Shanghai and was arrested at the North Railway Station. He was escorted to Changshu on the 8th. According to Xia's confession, he was 31 years old, from Anhui, and had served as a member of the anti-smuggling camp. The Zhang robbery case was induced by someone and this was his first time committing a robbery. There were twelve people who accompanied him at that time. They also stole eight water police guns and dispersed after sharing the loot in Zhitang. He is currently being held at the detective team headquarters, waiting for the capture of other criminals before being interrogated and sent to the county. In addition, it was learned that the principal offenders, Yu Laoda, Sanlian, and Wu Zhiyou, were also captured by the 16th team of the 4th district of the Taicang Water Police and are currently being held at the county government of that county. Upon receiving the news, the Public Security Bureau dispatched the captain of the detective team, Zhu Shunqing, to pick them up and bring them to Changshu for prosecution.</p>
<h3>Police and Militia Clash Over Salvaging Floating Objects</h3>
<p>The patrol boat of the 16th team of the 4th police district of this county discovered the beaches of Xianshengqiao Haikou and Fukoushan in this county and went to salvage. However, the 2nd district militia of Xianshengqiao also intended to go to salvage. Unexpectedly, the water police did not allow it, intending to take it to Hupukou, claiming that this was their duty of overseas defense. This led to a major dispute between the two parties, and a military drama almost broke out. Fortunately, the local district office mediated, and both parties requested instructions from the county government. Before the official document arrived, it was not allowed to move. However, the county government believed that the timber must have broken loose from a cable in the river and washed up with the tide. The objects had their owners. The police and militia should temporarily take custody of the timber and wait for the owners to come to Changshu to claim it.</p>
<h3>Provincial Department's Approval Amidst the Call for Tax Reduction in Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Previously, 72 citizens, including Dan Jinhe and Bao Xiangzhong, believed that the additional taxes in this county were very high and the people could not bear it. Therefore, they jointly petitioned the responsible agencies in Beijing and the province to grant a reduction to relieve the people's difficulties. Now it is learned that the provincial government and the Civil Affairs and Finance Department have both approved it. The approval of the provincial government reads, "The petition has been noted, and the Finance Department has forwarded it. Regarding the case of limiting additional land taxes, we have received a telegram from Chairman Jiang ordering the government to order each county to list in detail the current taxes and surcharges being collected and to list the facts and provide explanations as to which surcharges can be reduced and which can be eliminated. The Finance Department has already notified all counties to submit their reports for review and action, and should await further action." The Civil Affairs Department wrote, "The petition is noted and the county is ordered to investigate and report back to us for review."</p>
<h3>Bandits Rampant in the Tenth District of Gaoyou</h3>
<p>In the county's tenth district, bandits have been unusually rampant recently. Cases of kidnapping are heard every day. The bandits have more than ten large ships gathered in the rivers and reeds. Each ship has machine guns and each bandit has guns and ammunition. The situation is grand. Large and small households in the area are terrified, hearing every noise as a potential threat. The wealthy families have all moved away.</p>
<h3>Seventeen Murder Case Will Be Skeletal Examination</h3>
<p>In the county's second district, Gongtian township, during the breach of the dyke in the twentieth year of the Republic of China, farmers engaged in robbery, resulting in seventeen deaths, including Xu Yongmao. Xu Yongnian and other family members reported the case to the county government, and the township head Bai Weixiang was summoned and questioned. The case has been suspended and unresolved. Now it is heard that the High Court intends to thoroughly investigate the case to redress the wrong. The county government has been ordered to open the coffins for a major examination, and Ma Zhenbang, the county head of Jiangdu County, has been sent to supervise. The skeletal examination will be carried out shortly.</p>
<h3>Change of Director of Jiashan Business Tax Bureau</h3>
<p>Hu Tingyu, director of the Third District Business Tax Bureau, has been ordered to be transferred to the Second District Business Tax Bureau. The vacancy in the Third District will be filled by Shen Ruji, appointed by the province. It is now learned that the new and old directors have taken over on the 8th. Most of the staff in the bureau have been changed. However, the investigators are all experienced in tax affairs and familiar with the business conditions in Jiashan, so they are not changed to benefit tax revenue.</p>
<h3>Jiashan Thoroughly Investigates Public Properties in Sand Fields</h3>
<p>The Yekudang and other sand fields in the county, bordering Su Sheng, Qing Wu and other counties in the north of this county, extend to seventy or eighty thousand mu. Only a few dozen mu pay taxes, while thousands of mu or more have been occupied by private individuals. The provincial office for cleaning up the official properties in the sand fields of Hangjia prefecture, based on the petition of Qian Ze and other citizens of this county, has specially dispatched Shi Rongfu to conduct a thorough investigation in conjunction with the county government. Except for those who pay taxes, all private occupations will be auctioned.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Villagers Keeping Faith and Upholding Justice are Commendable</h3>
<p>In Hangzhou Ao, Xixiang, Cixi, there is a Zhang Jiachun, who is from a scholarly family, keeps to his poverty, and completes his life by working in the fields. His father, Zhang Zhufu, made a living by teaching children in the village, and his family was extremely poor. He suffered a fire and borrowed 120 yuan from his friend Ye Yuntan. Because they were good friends, no promissory note was made. When Zhufu was old and ill and about to die, Jiachun was still an infant. Knowing that he would not be able to repay it in this life, he made a promissory note and instructed his wife to give it to the Ye family, repeatedly instructing her, "I have never owed anyone a penny in my life. My son and grandson must repay this for me. Do not forget." When he died, Ye Weng went to mourn and burned the promissory note as a gift in front of the spirit. This matter has been going on for fifty years. Jiachun is also old. Eager to fulfill his last words, he gathered the proceeds of his hard work and deposited them in full. He entrusted Chen Qihuai, a respected elder in the village, to deliver it to the Ye family. The descendants of the Ye family refused to accept it because there was no evidence. They said, "If there is such a thing, Zhang's last words should be followed, but how can we go against the good intentions of our ancestors?" They declined it repeatedly. Jiachun insisted on paying it. Later, Chen Jun made a public judgment and moved the money to help the Ye family's Shilin Elementary School as a fund. The villagers praised the two for their good deeds. It is said that the whole story will be written in detail and sent to the county government for archival purposes, to be included in the literature section of the local gazetteer in the future to improve social customs.</p>

<h3>Academic Groups Welcome Marconi and Wife Yesterday, Italian Community Holds Public Banquet at Noon, Lays Foundation Stone for Jiaotong University Radio Station</h3>
<p>Italian radio inventor Marquis Marconi arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and was welcomed by people from all walks of life. Yesterday at noon, the Italian community originally planned to hold a public banquet for Mr. and Mrs. Marconi at the Italian Club at 285 Fousen Road. However, because Marconi had a cold, it was temporarily canceled. But at 4 p.m., Mr. and Mrs. Marconi still responded to the invitation of various academic groups in the city and held a grand tea party at Rong Hong Hall of Jiaotong University. During the tea party, Cai Yuanpei, President of the Academia Sinica, delivered a welcome speech. Marconi made a short speech and laid the foundation stone for the Jiaotong University Radio Station as a memorial. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Representatives in Attendance</h3>
<p>In addition to specially inviting Cai Yuanpei, President of the Academia Sinica, to be the chairman, the representatives of the other groups in attendance included Xu Peihuang, Shen Yi, and Shi Konghuai of the Chinese Institute of Engineers; Zhou Changshou of the Chinese Academic Society; Zhao Yilin of the International Telecommunications Bureau; Fang Ziwei and Wang Mingshan of the China Radio Engineering School; Yu Bingjian of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau; Jin Xiangyan, Tao Jun, Tao Mo, Zou Songqing, and Wang Zhenxiang of the Chinese Radio Research Society; Su Zuguo of the Shanghai Broadcasting Station; He Jiacheng and Shen Quanwu of the Telephone Employees Welfare Association of the Ministry of Communications; Zhang Tingjin of Jiaotong University; Yang Yufang of National Jinan University; Zheng Hongnian of the Shanghai Education Association; Zeng Shengdian of the Shanghai Education Bureau; Kang Xuanyi of the University Joint Council; Yang Xiaoshu of the China Science Society; Yang Zhaoyan of the National Academia Sinica; Chen Jicheng of the Secondary School Teachers and Staff Union; and more than one hundred reporters from various newspapers.</p>
<h3>Marconi's Arrival</h3>
<p>Mr. Marconi, accompanied by his wife, the Italian Minister and his wife, Mr. Poskeli, the Italian Consul Mr. Nylon, his secretary and staff, arrived at 4 p.m. He was received by Li Zhaohuan and Fang Ziwei, and introduced to Chairman Cai Yuanpei for a handshake. Ms. Wu Lintongyao received Mrs. Marconi. The guests and hosts were extremely happy to meet each other. Shortly after, President Li invited Marconi to take his seat, and the guests also took their seats one after another. After a light refreshment, the photographers gathered for more than ten minutes. First, Li Zhaohuan, in his capacity as host, made a brief introduction, followed by Chairman Cai Yuanpei, who delivered a welcome speech.</p>
<h3>Li Zhaohuan's Speech</h3>
<p>Mr. Li delivered the opening remarks, briefly stating, "Today, fourteen academic and educational groups in Shanghai are holding a welcome reception at Jiaotong University for Mr. Marquis Marconi, the great inventor of radio, and his wife. Considering the two greatest factors of change and progress in the world, they are discovery and invention. From ancient times to the present, among the countless discoveries and inventions, the ones that have had the greatest impact on the changes in the modern world are the discovery of America and the invention of radio telegraphy. Those who first discovered and invented both belong to the Italians. Their great achievements have been recorded by historians, geographers, and scientists. We are gathered here today to express our utmost respect and gratitude to this great inventor. Moreover, Italy and our country have a close relationship. I still remember that the first person to discover Chinese civilization was an Italian. Later, countless Italians exchanged knowledge and goods between the two countries, promoted international relations, and promoted education and religion. Although Italy is recognized as a strong country in the world, it has never infringed on China's territorial or political integrity. Jiaotong University is the first university in China to teach telegraphy theory and practice. It has long been a famous university in electrical engineering. Today, it is a great honor to be attached to the end of the fourteen academic and educational groups to welcome Sir Marconi. I wish Mr. Marconi a successful future." He then announced that Mr. Fang Ziwei, a student of the university, proposed to build a "Marconi Memorial" in front of the engineering building of the university. Its structure is inspired by the antenna and transmitter invented by Marconi. He asked Mr. Marconi to personally perform the foundation laying ceremony to commemorate Mr. Marconi's visit to the school today.</p>
<h3>Cai Yuanpei's Speech</h3>
<p>Chairman Cai Yuanpei delivered a welcome speech saying, "Today, our Shanghai academic groups are here to welcome Mr. Marconi, the inventor of radio, and his wife. We are very honored to have you here. We have a joyful mood at this gathering. There is no one among us who has not enjoyed the benefits of radio, and there are several who are working hard to manufacture machines for the application of radio, and there are several who are studying the theory of radio. They all admire Mr. Marconi, and today we have the opportunity to admire the demeanor of the great inventor, so naturally we are extremely happy. Secondly, it arouses our ambition to strive. Before Mr. Marconi, the academics of radio, such as Hertz in Germany and Moxwell in England, had already invented the theory of electric waves and the wave detector, and all the other past electrical scientists were pioneers for Mr. Marconi, but we did not make such efforts, which is what we are ashamed of. However, our nation does not lack creativity. Like the compass, printing, and gunpowder, our ancestors have made great contributions. As long as we are willing to work hard, we will not be helpless and only take advantage of ready-made things. Mr. Marconi is now engaged in the most convenient wireless telephone, and also feels that there is hope for success in the communication between the earth and various planets. There are still many places where we can work hard on other similar issues. It is also natural that we are especially aroused by the enthusiasm to catch up because of Mr. Marconi's presence. We look forward to Mr. Marconi's advice. We wish Mr. Marconi and Mrs. Marconi health and happiness during this trip."</p>
<h3>Marconi's Reply</h3>
<p>After Mr. Cai finished his speech, Li Zhaohuan translated it into English. After the translation, Mr. Marconi stood up to reply. Mr. Marconi spoke very fluent English, and his voice was very similar to that of the British and Americans. His meaning was slightly, "I am very honored to be here to receive the welcome of various academic groups, and I would like to express my deep gratitude to Chairman Cai and President Li. I am very pleased to be welcomed by the political authorities and academic groups everywhere I go on this tour in your country. However, China is too big and I have too little time to travel. In such a short period, I want to see such a big China, so what I have learned is of course too little. However, I have seen a glimpse of the beauty and greatness of China in Beijing and Nanjing. In the past, Mr. Marco Polo of my country was a Chinese official and did things for China. This is well known to everyone present. I am very ashamed that I have not been able to reach the former people. I now see that many people in your country are now working hard on the research of physics and other subjects, which is a very gratifying thing. Just now, Chairman Cai reported that China has contributed to the world by inventing gunpowder, printing, and the compass. I hope that the people of your country will continue to make more inventions. Although my time to visit your country this time is short, I hope to have the opportunity to come to China again in the future to meet you again. I am very sorry that there is no time to give a detailed lecture on radio. Please forgive me, thank you for your kindness."</p>
<h3>Radio Station Foundation Stone</h3>
<p>After Mr. Marconi finished his reply, President Li announced that he would invite Mr. Marconi to the front of the school's Science Museum to lay the foundation stone for the radio station to be built as a memorial to Mr. Marconi's visit to China. After the announcement, the meeting was adjourned. Everyone followed Mr. Marconi and President Li to the front of the school's Science Museum, where Mr. Marconi personally erected a copper radio station pillar. After the ceremony, the crowd applauded, and Mr. Marconi and his wife said goodbye to the welcoming representatives, boarded the car and left. According to the report, the copper pillar was specially made, very heavy in quality, and about twenty feet high. It was donated to the alma mater by Mr. Fang Ziwei. In the past, Fan Fengyuan, Wang Mingshan, Shen Xibao, Zhu Shun, Chen Ruisheng, and Huang Zhongyuan of the China Radio Engineering School escorted it to Jiaotong University. The memorial is inspired by the radio antenna invented by Marconi, and a stone altar is planned to be built next to it to form the focus of the parabola to match its original meaning. Marconi praised the structure of the memorial as new, smart, and agile, and smiled at Mr. Fang and said that if it is used for radio ultra-short waves (Micro Radio Wave), the copper pillar would still be too long. His degree of research on short waves can be seen here.</p>
<h3>Zhang Ji and Other Four Representatives to Go to Hong Kong This Morning to Mediate the Situation: Exchange Opinions and Urge Southwest Commissioners to Go to Beijing; First Meet with Hu Hanmin, Then Visit Chen and Li in Guangdong and Guangxi; The Fourth Plenary Session Will Not Be Postponed, or the Opening Ceremony Will Be Held First</h3>
<p>The Central Government has specially appointed Central Committee members Zhang Ji, Ma Chaojun, Chen Zhaoying, and Wang Luyi to go south to Shanghai, Guangdong, and other places in a private capacity to visit Hu Hanmin and the Central Committee members in the Southwest, exchange opinions on resolving the current situation, and urge them to go to Beijing to attend the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee. Ma, Chen, and Wang departed from Beijing by overnight train at 7:30 yesterday morning and arrived in Shanghai first. Zhang Ji was delayed due to business and did not arrive until 2:20 in the afternoon. They are scheduled to take the President Pierce of the Great American Company from Shanghai to Hong Kong this morning. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>The Four Representatives Yesterday</h3>
<p>After receiving the Southwest's suggestions, the Central Government presented them for discussion at the Standing Committee meeting this past Thursday (the 7th). A concrete decision was immediately reached, and four Central Committee members, Zhang Ji, Ma Chaojun, Chen Zhaoying, and Wang Luyi, were dispatched to Guangdong to visit Hu Hanmin and the Central Committee members in the Southwest to solicit their opinions on resolving the current situation and invite them to Beijing to attend the meeting. After receiving their orders, the three representatives, Ma, Chen, and Wang, took an overnight train from Beijing the night before and arrived in Shanghai at 7:30 yesterday morning. Zhang stayed in Beijing for one night due to official business and took an early express train to Shanghai yesterday morning, arriving at 2:45 in the afternoon. Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng specially sent Secretary Huang Jianfen to the station to welcome him.</p>
<h3>Taking the American Ship to Hong Kong This Morning</h3>
<p>The four representatives boarded a ship at the New Customs Wharf around 10:00 last night and went to the Bailianjing Wharf in Pudong to board the President Pierce of the Great American Company. The ship set sail from Shanghai at around 5:00 this morning and is expected to arrive in Hong Kong on the 11th. In addition to legislator Fu Bingchang, Zhang Ximan, a specialist from the Border Affairs Group of the General Staff Headquarters of the Military Commission, and nine other attendants are also traveling with them. Mr. Fu Bingchang is going to Hong Kong to visit his wife and has no other mission.</p>
<h3>Zhang Visited Wu and Li, among Others</h3>
<p>After getting off the train at the North Station yesterday afternoon, Central Committee member Zhang Ji immediately accompanied Huang Jianfen, the welcoming representative of Mayor Wu, to Haige Road to meet with Mr. Wu. They talked for about half an hour before leaving. Subsequently, he visited Li Shizeng and Zhang Jingjiang, among others, before returning to the Dongya Hotel to rest in the evening.</p>
<h3>Yang and Ma Meet to Exchange Opinions</h3>
<p>Yang Dezhao, the representative of Chen Jitang, the commander-in-chief of the Southern Route Army for Bandit Suppression in the Five Provinces, visited Mr. Ma Chaojun at around 9:30 yesterday morning to exchange opinions. He left after talking until about 10:00. Regarding the Southwest's alleged five conditions to the Central Government, Yang said he had not heard of them and consistently denied them.</p>
<h3>Ma Chaojun Discusses the Mission of This Trip</h3>
<p>According to Ma Chaojun, who spoke to reporters yesterday, the group going south includes Zhang Ji, Chen Zhaoying, Wang Luyi, and himself. Committee member Zhang had unfinished official business yesterday and changed his plans to take the Beijing-Zhabei intermodal express train to Shanghai this morning (i.e., yesterday morning). The mission of our trip south is merely to consult with old friends in the Southwest in a private capacity to discuss the current situation and urge them to go to Beijing as soon as possible to attend the Fourth Plenary Session and work together for the country. Therefore, we have no central government orders for this trip, nor do we carry private letters from Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei. Regarding his observations on the situation in Fujian, Ma said that the measures taken by the rebels Li and Chen are insane and cannot be resolved by political means. The rumor that Guangdong is remitting funds to help Fujian is absurd. One can see that from the increased defenses of the Guangdong army in recent days. Guangxi Province is quite dissatisfied with the actions of Fujian Province. The meeting between Li Jishen and Li Zongren also did not happen. As for Fu Bingchang's trip to Guangdong, it is purely a private matter, he said.</p>
<h3>Zhang Puquan Talks About Sincere Consultation</h3>
<p>Central Committee member Zhang Ji arrived in Shanghai from Beijing at 2:30 yesterday afternoon. When reporters interviewed him on the train, he said that we plan to go to Hong Kong first on this trip to Guangdong to meet with Hu Hanmin, and then to Guangzhou to visit Chen Jitang and others to invite the Central Committee members in the Southwest to Beijing to work together for the country. If there is enough time, we may go to Guangxi to meet with comrades Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi. We plan to rush back to attend the Fourth Plenary Session before the 20th of this month. Regarding the Fujian Incident, we hope that the Southwest will jointly take responsibility for eliminating it. Since our country is currently facing both internal and external troubles, uniting to resist foreign aggression is something we don't have time to do, let alone divide and collapse, creating opportunities for enemies. Therefore, on this trip, we plan to exchange opinions on the handling of the Fujian matter privately with Mr. Hu Zhan Tang and others. However, Mr. Chiang (Kai-shek) and Mr. Wang (Jingwei) did not give us any written documents to take with us. As for the rumored five conditions for resolving the current situation proposed by the Southwest, I am not yet aware of them and cannot tell you. The Central Government has decided that the Fourth Plenary Session to be held in Beijing on the 20th of this month will open as scheduled. As for whether the organization that destroyed the party and the country in Fujian this time can gain the sympathy of the people, the world will have its own public opinion, and there is no need for me to condemn it verbally. In short, the most important task of this trip is to invite the Central Committee members in the Southwest to Beijing to attend the Fourth Plenary Session and sincerely discuss the unity within the party to cope with the national crisis, he said.</p>
<h3>Chen Zhaoying Talks About Hope for Understanding</h3>
<p>Reporters met with Mr. Chen Zhaoying and Wang Luyi yesterday morning. According to Mr. Chen, the Central Government, in order to seek party unity, specially sent us to Hong Kong and Guangdong to visit the Southwest Committee members, convey the Central Government's intentions, explain the government's past domestic and foreign facilities, eliminate all kinds of misunderstandings, hope for understanding, and exchange concrete opinions on resolving the current situation. We also urge the committee members to come to Beijing to participate in the Fourth Plenary Session and work together for the country. The Central Government has no written opinions or private letters from Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei to take with us on this trip. All opinions on resolving the current situation must wait until we meet with the Southwest Committee members in Hong Kong and Guangdong, and then discuss them in detail based on the opinions they put forward. It is rumored that the Guangdong authorities have proposed five measures to the Central Government, such as holding a peace conference in Shanghai, implementing constitutional government early, and canceling the People's Government in Fujian, etc. The Central Government has not received the official proposal, and it is said that it is the opinion of one or two individuals in the Southwest. The Central Government hopes that we will be able to urge the Southwest Committee members to come to Beijing to participate in the Fourth Plenary Session. If there is not enough time, the opening ceremony of the Fourth Plenary Session on the 20th can be held first, and then the formal meeting will be held after the Southwest representatives arrive in Beijing. There is no need to postpone the meeting. If the Fujian matter needs to be resolved peacefully, it is not possible unless the Fujian side first cancels its pseudo-organization. As for opening up political power, it cannot be achieved by empty words. It is not possible to advocate opening up political power today and implement it tomorrow. There must be certain steps and considerable preparation. The second draft of the constitution will be announced and opened for discussion in about half a month. In the future, when the National Assembly is held and constitutional government is implemented, it will be the time for the Kuomintang to open up political power, and the deadline should not be far away.</p>
<h3>Chiang's Reply to Li Liejun's Letter: Agrees with the Principles of Joint Political Proposition; Also Hopes for Peaceful Resolution of the Fujian Issue</h3>
<p>Central Committee member Li Liejun previously sent a letter to Chairman Chiang expressing his strong advocacy for peace and the speedy liberation of the people from bondage. It has been recorded many times. Now it has been learned that Chairman Chiang's reply letter is quite sincere, which shows Chiang's hope for peace and his agreement with Li's political propositions. The original letter is copied below:</p>
<h3>Chiang's Reply Letter</h3>
<p>Having just received your letter, it is as if I have personally received your teaching. The Fujian Rebellion broke out suddenly, not caring about colluding with the Communists and Japan, destroying the party and changing the era to achieve their goals. It was truly unexpected. Having gone so far astray, whether a peaceful resolution can be effective is still questionable. If there is a glimmer of hope, I would be happy to follow it. Your discussion of liberating the people's freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and association is what I have always agreed with, and we have discussed it many times. However, these are all ways to strengthen the foundation, and the current Fujian Rebellion has the potential to expand the bandit area and summon foreign aggression again. Using this to respond to the situation, I am afraid it will be too late. I still ask for your advice, do you think so? This is a special reply, and I respectfully wish you success, Chiang Kai-shek.</p>
<h3>Li's Speech</h3>
<p>The New News Agency reporter visited Li at his private residence yesterday morning. His published speech is recorded below: The Fujian matter is like wild fire and accumulated firewood, and its end cannot be foreseen. Moreover, there have been years of war in the country, and it is especially inappropriate to have another war. Therefore, I very much hope for a peaceful resolution. To achieve this goal, we must explore its principles, reform ourselves, and seek the trust of the world. It cannot be delayed. My words and actions have always had a certain pattern. My academic ability is insufficient to express my intentions, and I am deeply willing to hear the guidance of the world.</p>
<h3>British Acting Consul General Hosts Blue Pyenson Yesterday; Many Chinese and Foreign Guests Arrive</h3>
<p>British Acting Consul General in Shanghai, Davidson, hosted a tea party at the British Consulate on the Bund at 6:00 last night to entertain British Minister Blue Pyenson, who is being transferred to Egypt as a diplomatic official and will return to China on the British ship Lanqi on the 12th of this month, and important figures from various Chinese and foreign organizations. Those who participated included Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Municipal Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, Jianghai Customs Superintendent Lan Du Tang Hai'an and his wife, Zhao Tiewei, representative of the Foreign Affairs Office, Wen Hongen, Director of the Public Security Bureau, Secretaries Li Mu and Tan Baoshou, etc. On the foreign side, there were many male and female guests such as General Tax Secretary Meyler and President of the British Chamber of Commerce, Maxwell. Davidson and his wife personally hosted them and served champagne and Western pastries. They began to leave one after another around 8:00.</p>
<h3>Japanese Captain Talks About the Fujian Incident: Troops Practice Street Fighting and Fire at Each Other; Soldiers Injured 27, Merchants Injured 3</h3>
<p>Hualian News Agency, local news. Shanghai Daily reported that at 2:30 yesterday afternoon, the Osaka Lines ship Fujian Maru arrived in Shanghai from Fujian. Kawahara Tasuke spoke to Japanese reporters about the recent situation in Fujian as follows: The new Fujian organization claims that its annual revenue is about 20 million yuan, seemingly wanting to show its stability through the amount of financial revenue. The new national flag is displayed at all fortresses, except for the customs. Because the revenue does not meet the expenditure, the new organization may take over the customs. The new tariff rate has not yet been determined. Fujian officials and civilians are nervous due to the unstable foundation of the political situation. On the 5th of this month, some troops in Fuzhou conducted street fighting exercises in the city. However, one team mistakenly thought that another team was rebelling and loaded their guns and fired. The other team also fired back in a panic. The two sides fought fiercely for half an hour before stopping. At that time, 27 soldiers had been injured and three civilians had been killed. The troops in Fuzhou are a mixed bag of soldiers, and their discipline is not very orderly. There are also many red elements in the provincial capital, he said.</p>
<h3>Dumping Tax on Foreign Rice and Wheat</h3>
<p>Collection to be advanced from the 16th of this month. It is said that the measures will be announced on the 28th. Regarding the issue of collecting dumping taxes on foreign rice and wheat, rice merchants from various provinces and cities across the country have previously requested the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry to promptly start collecting taxes in order to save the rural economy and stabilize the price of domestic rice. Subsequently, the two ministries drafted the amount of tax to be collected and the types of goods subject to tax, and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for approval and ordered their implementation. The original plan was to start collecting taxes from January 1 next year. According to reliable sources from the Greater China News Agency, the Ministry of Finance has decided to advance the dumping tax on foreign rice and wheat and start collecting it from December 16. The tax collection method is to collect one yuan (calculated in gold units) per 100 jin of foreign rice and 0.25 yuan (calculated in gold units) per 100 jin of foreign wheat. Detailed measures will be officially announced within a few days.</p>
<p>Huadong News Agency said that in recent years, foreign wheat from various countries has been dumped in large quantities while China's rural areas are bankrupt, causing the price of domestic wheat flour to decline day by day. Farmers are suffering unspeakably. The Ministry of Finance previously agreed to the request of agricultural and commercial institutions in various places and decided to collect a tax on foreign rice, which was scheduled to be implemented from New Year's Day next year. According to Huadong News Agency, the foreign wheat and foreign flour have been decided to be handled, and the detailed rules for implementation will be announced on the 28th of this month. The tax rate is 1.5% for foreign wheat and 2.5% for foreign flour. Because China lacks raw materials for foreign wheat, it needs to be supplemented by foreign wheat. China produces a lot of wheat flour, and making flour from wheat can maintain many factories and workers in the country, it is said.</p>
<h3>Japanese Police Greatly Expel Overseas Chinese; Searches Conducted Simultaneously in Various Places</h3>
<p>In recent years, Chinese businessmen and workers residing in Japan have suffered various forms of discrimination from that country, resulting in an increasing number of unemployed. Many batches have been repatriated to China by our embassy and consulates in Japan, and many have been expelled from Japan by the Japanese authorities to Shanghai. However, recently, another large number of Chinese merchants in Japan have been押登 Japanese ships and expelled back to Shanghai by police in various parts of Japan due to unemployment. The investigation report is as follows:</p>
<h3>Aichi Prefecture</h3>
<p>Most of the overseas Chinese in 5th District, Nakafukuguchi-cho, Nagoya City, Aichi Prefecture, etc., are engaged in work and small-scale vending. This year, affected by the sluggish market in Japan, unemployment has gradually increased. The Aichi Prefectural Police Department immediately intervened and expelled them. They first arrested more than 20 Chinese people, including Yu Amu, Chen Qifu, Zhang Yanbao, Liu Zhushi, Xi Xulu, Du Minglong, Zhang Yaozhang, Lin Youjin, Zhou Dexi, Zhang Haishui, Xia Chunfang, and Zheng Heshu Chen Zu Cao, etc., and detained them in the police station to prevent them from sneaking to other places. When the Japanese ship Asosan Maru arrived in Nagoya, they were all押上 onboard and expelled back to Shanghai. The overseas Chinese all arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The situation was very embarrassing. They are temporarily staying in small inns in the 16th Puli.</p>
<h3>Kanagawa</h3>
<p>Most of the overseas Chinese in the Miyagi and Sendai areas of Kanagawa Prefecture are from Fujian and Guangdong. Some run restaurants and others are呉服 merchants. This time, the Japanese expelled unemployed overseas Chinese. The Kanagawa Prefectural Police Department sent police to check around. They arrested a group of Cantonese people, including Qu Zhifeng and Liu Xunnian, and Fujianese people, including Liu Congqing and Tang Ahua, etc., in Miyagi and Sendai, etc., and detained them in the police station. Later, they were sent to Kobe and ordered to take a ship back to their country. If they did not have enough travel expenses, they抵行李物件. Yesterday, the Qu arrived in Shanghai. Due to economic difficulties, they were unable to return to their hometowns in Guangdong and Fujian immediately, and they were very distressed.</p>
<h3>Tokyo</h3>
<p>The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department also sent police to check within its jurisdiction and found a group of unemployed Chinese workers, including Lin Weirui, Lin Hongshun, Wu Jinde, and Zhou Wenqin, etc. From the 1st of this month, they were taken into custody at the police department. When a ship was available, they were押上 onboard the Japanese ship and expelled to Shanghai. They were closely monitored along the way to prevent them from landing again. The overseas Chinese arrived in Shanghai yesterday, and their situation was as embarrassing as the previous two batches.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Industry Establishes a Fish Market in Shanghai; Ministry Member Yu Kai Zhan Comes to Shanghai to Negotiate</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry has reached an agreement with the Shanghai Municipal Government to establish a fish market in Shanghai. The capital is set at 1.5 million yuan, with the Ministry of Industry and the Shanghai Municipal Government taking on 1 million yuan, and the fishermen taking on 500,000 yuan. Yu Kai Zhan has been sent to Shanghai to negotiate with the fishermen.</p>
<h3>Chinese Officials in the Interior Give Preferential Treatment to Foreigners, Causing Trouble; Two Young Men Have Now Returned to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Great American Evening News reported that Martin, an Englishman, 20 years old, and Scott, 23 years old, took a car to Hangzhou along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Main Road on Tuesday morning for a pleasure trip. When they drove to the Haiyan area, they knocked down a woman and were detained by the local police. Martin's father is the manager of the machinery department of Tienshang Foreign Company in this city and lives at No. 610 Lafayette Road. After receiving the news on Wednesday night, he went to Haiyan in person yesterday to meet with local officials. He brought the two young men back to Shanghai that night. It is said that the preferential treatment they received could not be obtained in any country. It is also said that the matter is currently being handled by the British Consul General, and he is unwilling to disclose the details until the British officers have completed the investigation and allowed it. Some foreign newspapers reported that Chinese officers had made various kinds of difficulties and that he had brought a large sum of money to rescue them, which is not accurate. For the sake of fairness, he will publish the circumstances of the treatment received by the two young men in the next few days, that is, his son's letter that day also said that the treatment he received was quite good, and he also had good reviews for the Chinese officers after returning. As for asking the British Consul General to investigate, it is hoped that this will dispel the doubts of foreigners about the Haiyan local officials and that they will know that they have provided the two young men with great assistance this time. In addition, the release of the two men did not involve paying any money. If the injured woman needs compensation, it will be paid within a few days, he said.</p>
<h3>Heavy Fog at the Wusong Estuary Obstructs Merchant Ships</h3>
<p>The weather has been overcast for several days, and there has been heavy fog along the coast and at the mouth of the Yangtze River. Merchant ships entering and leaving have been obstructed. The Taikoo's Yangtze River ship Huangpu and the Jardine Matheson's Fuzhou ship Jiesheng were both obstructed by fog outside the Wusong Estuary, causing them to fail to arrive on time. There are also many ships leaving the port that are anchored and waiting for clear weather outside the Wusong Estuary.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke and Others Arrive in Shanghai This Morning</h3>
<p>Sun Ke, Gan Naiguang, Qin Zhen, Fu Rulin, Liu Weichi, and Peng Xuepei arrived in Shanghai last night on an overnight express train.</p>
<h3>Java Restricts the Import of Foreign Rice; Originally Scheduled for Only Four Months; Now It Will Continue Forever</h3>
<p>According to news from the Guidance Department of the International Trade Bureau yesterday, the Javanese government, in view of the large amount of rice produced in the area, has created a situation where supply exceeds demand. In addition, the area restricts sugar production, so many private sugarcane fields have been converted into rice paddies, resulting in a sharp increase in harvests. If foreign rice is allowed to enter and be dumped, it is feared that the Javanese market will be unbearable. Therefore, emergency measures have been taken to restrict the import of foreign rice. According to the memorandum submitted by the government to the National Assembly, it is not intended to raise local rice prices, but to sell the country's stored rice so that it will not accumulate. The restriction was originally scheduled for four months, from March to July of this year, but has now been changed to an indefinite continuation, it is said.</p>

The above totals £110,338. The amounts to be deducted are: European expenses £15,135, the cost of new interest coupons and registered shares £1,102, directors' fees £4,200, income tax £49,188, and dividends paid in advance on May 4 this year £49,000. The above totals £118,625. After deducting the two, there is a shortfall of £8,287. The directors propose to allocate £10,000 from the reserve fund to meet the above. The remaining £1,713 will be carried over to the next session's account.</p>
<h3>The Newspaper Association Will Undertake Newspaper Sales on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line; A Contract Has Been Signed with the Railway Bureau; Effective from the 1st of This Month</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration will allow the newspaper sales on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line passenger trains, since the contractor Zhou Yizhang was murdered, the contract signed by both parties is no longer valid. They immediately contacted the Newspaper Association to undertake the matter. Both parties have now reached an agreement and signed a contract. The process and the main points of the contract are as follows:</p>
<h3>Negotiation Process</h3>
<p>The newspaper sales on the Hangzhou-Shanghai line passenger trains were previously contracted by Zhou Yiting with the Railway Bureau. In March of this year, Zhou Yiting was suddenly murdered. At that time, the contract had not yet expired, so Zhou Youyi temporarily represented him. Subsequently, the Railway Bureau asked the consulting lawyer to study the case. It was considered that since the original contractor Zhou Yiting had died, the contract was naturally extinguished. Therefore, the Shanghai Newspaper Association, which contracted the newspaper sales on the Nanjing-Shanghai line passenger trains, was contacted to undertake the newspaper sales on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line passenger trains as well. The contract fee and license fee are calculated in proportion to the passenger volume of the two lines and the first and second class passengers, that is, the Shanghai-Hangzhou line is about 58% of the Nanjing-Shanghai line. A contract has now been signed and is effective from December 1.</p>
<h3>Contract Summary</h3>
<p>The important clauses of the contract signed by both parties are extracted as follows: (Article 1) The Railway Bureau allows the contractor to hire newspaper vendors (one per passenger train) to sell newspapers exclusively. The newspaper vendors must be selected from those who are legitimate and have a guarantor. They must be hired in a certain direction and wear clean uniforms when serving (the style of the uniforms must be submitted to the director of the Traffic Department for approval and provided by the contractor themselves) and wear numbered copper plates (the copper plates are issued by the Railway Bureau and cost one yuan each). They must also carry a license issued by the Railway Bureau. Otherwise, in addition to paying the price according to regulations, they will be punished appropriately. (Article 2) The contractor shall pay three months' rent as a deposit upon signing the contract and deposit it with the Accounting Department of the Railway Bureau and provide a reliable guarantee to guarantee the performance of the contract clauses. However, if the guarantor changes during the period, it must be reported immediately and a suitable guarantor must be found, otherwise, it will be deemed as deception once detected and punished severely. (Article 3) The contractor shall pay the contract fee of 290 yuan and the license fee of 88 yuan in full to the Railway Bureau on the first day of each lunar month before obtaining a license. Otherwise, the newspaper vendors shall not be allowed to board the train to do business even if they purchase tickets themselves. (Article 7) The newspapers carried by the newspaper vendors on the passenger train for sale shall be limited to the bag they are carrying, and they shall not bring extra newspapers. Otherwise, they will be fined according to regulations once they are caught. (Article 8) The newspapers carried by the newspaper vendors on the passenger train for sale must be folded in advance before boarding the train and shall not be folded on the train. Violators will be punished. (Article 13) The newspaper vendors shall charge the price stipulated in the Railway Bureau's Traffic Board when selling newspapers and shall not increase the price without authorization. Violators will be severely punished. (Article 14) The premium for the exchange of large and small silver dollars shall be handled in accordance with the premium table of the Railway Bureau's ticket office. (Article 16) The contractor and its newspaper vendors shall not privately transport or carry goods and contraband in the Railway Bureau's boundary or on the train. Once discovered, in addition to being fined according to regulations and the offenders being sent to the court for punishment, the contractor will be fined 250 yuan for the first offense and 500 yuan for the second offense. For the third offense, in addition to the above punishment, the contract will be cancelled. If the contractor suffers losses as a result, the Railway Bureau will not be responsible. However, if the contractor discovers and reports it on their own initiative, the Railway Bureau will handle it according to the circumstances. (Article 19) The contractor shall not lease or assign all or part of the benefits that they should receive under the contract to others. If there is such corruption, it will be deemed a violation of the contract and the contract will be cancelled immediately. (Article 22) The validity period of this contract is one year, from December 1, 1933 to November 30, 1934. However, at any time during the period, if either party believes that the contract should be cancelled, they shall notify the other party in writing one month in advance to terminate the contract.</p>
<h3>National General Chamber of Commerce Cables Request to Reduce Factory Taxes: Clarifies Necessity of Cotton Yarn, Flour, and Matches</h3>
<p>The National General Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a cable to the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing stating: "To Your Excellency, Ministry of Finance, Nanjing: We recently received a cable from the Shanxi Provincial General Chamber of Commerce stating that the Third Session of our Membership Representative Assembly received a proposal from the Pingyao County Chamber of Commerce requesting the central government to reduce factory tax rates to maintain domestic goods and stop financial leakage. We believe that the current trade deficit is alarming the nation, and economic construction is a national concern. However, to stop financial leakage, we must first maintain domestic goods, and to maintain domestic goods, we must reduce tax rates. Since the abolition of the Likin tax, the tax rates set by our central government for various factory taxes are excessively high. For example, the production tax for cotton yarn is eight yuan and thirty-nine cents per bale, the factory tax for flour is one dime per bag, and the factory tax for matches is ten yuan per box, which is several times higher than in previous years. Such high tax rates lead to high costs and uncompetitive prices, resulting in the dumping of foreign goods and the failure of domestic goods. For example, the yarn factories in Yuci and Xinjiang, the flour factories in Taiyuan and Yuci, and the match factories in Taiyuan, Pingyao, Fenyang, and Xinjiang are unable to develop their businesses or have shut down not due to poor management, but because of the heavy burden of factory taxes. Furthermore, cotton yarn is related to the clothing of ordinary people, flour is related to food, and matches are related to daily use. All three are necessities for people's livelihoods. If no measures are taken to help them, not only will commerce be affected, but also the people's livelihood will be greatly affected. How can we stop financial leakage and promote domestic goods? We request the Assembly to make a public resolution, present it to the Ministry of Finance for review and reduction, and cable the National and Provincial General Chambers of Commerce for unanimous support." We have learned that our country's production is lagging behind, and almost all goods are imported from abroad. Although there are a few factories that can resist, the factory taxes are too heavy, making it difficult to compete. Therefore, although it has been advocated for many years, the market is still full of foreign goods, and the amount of annual financial leakage is heartbreaking. If we do not try to remedy the situation, we will lose our country and reduce our food supply. The only way to remedy this is to fundamentally reduce tax rates, so that domestic goods can be produced at low cost, and sales can be expanded, and imported goods will be eliminated without resistance. We are now cabling this information to you, hoping that you will forward it to the Ministry of Finance for review and approval of the reduction of factory taxes to promote domestic goods. This is our earnest prayer. National General Chamber of Commerce, respectfully. (Official Seal)"</p>
<h3>Silk Industry Representatives from Various Regions Urgently Request Establishment of a Control Association: Song Ziwen Agrees to Submit to the Next Standing Committee Meeting for Discussion</h3>
<p>Following the decline of the silk industry, silk factory associations from Shanghai, Zhejiang, Wuxi, and other regions yesterday sent representatives to petition the National Economic Council, requesting the immediate establishment of a Silk Industry Control Association. Silk industry representatives from Chongqing also made the same request to the Economic Council. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Joint Petition</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 10:00 AM, the silk industry associations from Shanghai, Wuxi, Zhejiang, and other regions sent five representatives, including Shen Huachen, Chu Huiseng, Cheng Bingruo, Chen Zezhong, and Sun Rongchang, to the National Economic Council to meet with Standing Committee member Song Ziwen. However, three representatives, including Jiang Huaxian, Zhang Yunsheng, and Qian Fenghao, were unable to attend due to other commitments. Song Ziwen personally received them. The representatives first stated the decline of the silk industry and requested the speedy establishment of a Silk Industry Control Committee to purchase silk in stock, promote it abroad, stabilize market prices, and save silk merchants from bankruptcy. Mr. Song agreed to submit the representatives' requests to the next Standing Committee meeting for discussion and decision, and hoped that a written report would be prepared. The representatives left around 11:00 AM.</p>
<h3>Urgent Need for Relief</h3>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency interviewed Shen Huachen, chairman of the Shanghai Silk Factory Association, yesterday. According to him, the silk industry has been in decline for many years and has reached its peak. It is now affected by the dumping of Japanese silk in the European and American markets, which has caused the price of Chinese silk to fall. This spring, when the price of Chinese silk was 900 yuan per bale, factories were already losing money on the silk they had produced. Now, the price has fallen from 900 yuan to 500 yuan per bale, and there is no transaction. Factories are suffering even greater losses and are on the verge of bankruptcy. In Shanghai alone, 113 silk factories are struggling to survive, and only six are operating. Soon, all of them will be forced to shut down. As for the methods of rescue, the silk merchants themselves are powerless and must rely on the government. Therefore, they have jointly appealed to the National Economic Council to request the speedy establishment of a Silk Industry Control Association for relief.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Merchants' Petition</h3>
<p>Since arriving in Shanghai, Li Kui'an, the silk industry representative from Chongqing, has been paying close attention to the government's establishment of silk industry control. Yesterday, he also petitioned the National Economic Council to quickly form a silk industry relief association. The petition stated: "Regarding the urgent need to organize a Silk Industry Control Committee to save the silk industry from crisis, we have learned that your association intends to save industry and restore the rural economy to save the country, and has various control organizations. Since the issuance of the order, the whole country has been looking forward to it. The cotton industry control has now been successful, and the cotton industry is expected to recover. Chinese silk has recently been affected by the dumping of Japanese silk and the resistance of rayon, and its price has fallen drastically. In recent months, old silk has been piled up and no one has been interested in it. Factories have been shutting down one after another, and workers have been gradually losing their jobs. In the face of this common disaster and social hidden concerns, it is unthinkable. It will not be successful unless a control is organized quickly, a thorough solution is sought, and a fundamental relief is provided. Kui'an previously telegraphed your association, respectfully requesting the speedy organization of control on file. In recent days, the silk industry in Sichuan Province has suffered this hardship, and the situation is urgent and cannot be delayed. Therefore, we specially present it to your association again, respectfully requesting the speedy organization of a silk industry relief association to save the silk industry from danger. We anxiously await your orders. This petition is to the National Economic Council, by Li Kui'an, Chairman of the Chongqing Silk Industry Association, silk merchant representatives Li Jiqing, and eight others."</p>
<h3>Water Company's Letter to the Real Estate Association Regarding the Decision on Non-Domestic Water Usage</h3>
<p>The British Shanghai Water Company sent a letter to the Real Estate Association yesterday, stating: "To whom it may concern: According to the contract signed by our company with the Public Works Department on May 3, 1932, if an owner or resident draws water from the same water pipe for both domestic and non-domestic use, and (one or more) are used for this non-domestic use, a contract shall be signed with the user (single or multiple) to charge for this non-domestic water usage according to the prices in effect for non-domestic water usage at any time, or at the company's discretion, install auxiliary water meters (one or more) to calculate the quantity of this non-domestic water supply, and simultaneously sign a contract to charge for this supply according to the prices for non-domestic water usage. The above is the contract signed with the Public Works Department, and it is also stipulated that these auxiliary water meters shall be installed by the company, but the installation costs shall be borne by the owner or user, and the company shall maintain them and inspect their records in accordance with the rules or methods determined by the company at any time, and the owner or user shall pay the company a monthly fee of one yuan, eight dimes, and seven and a half cents for each auxiliary water meter. This fee shall be paid in advance at the beginning of each quarter. Our company has repeatedly investigated places where water usage is excessive for a long time. Wherever non-domestic water usage has been found, the owners have been asked to handle the procedures for separate supply or install auxiliary water meters. However, although some owners have followed this proposal, many are still waiting and seeing, so the problem of excessive water usage is still difficult to resolve satisfactorily. However, if the supply of non-domestic water is not strictly separated, it will be difficult to establish a proper standard for domestic water rates. To facilitate the early implementation of this separation method, it has been decided that this decision, which has been approved by the Public Works Department, will install auxiliary water meters for all supplies of non-domestic water. The installation costs will be borne by our company, and no monthly fees will be charged. However, the decision of who should install and who should not install will be made by our company. As for the method of installing these auxiliary water meters, it will be gradually implemented within the scope permitted by the quantity of inventory, the quantity of new goods in the future, and the number of staff. However, the selection should try to prioritize users with the largest non-domestic water usage. As for owners who wish to add auxiliary water meters, they can still request installation in accordance with the previous methods."</p>
<h3>Wusong Wheel Case to be Mediated by Officials Sent by the Ministry: Seamen's Union Denies Conditions Signed by Guangdong: Appropriate Solution to be Agreed Upon in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports that the Wusong Wheel expulsion of workers case of Taikoo Company has been resolved by the Guangzhou Seamen's Union, but many of the conditions are inappropriate, causing resentment among the seamen. The Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union believes that this matter is related to the future protection of seamen, and is by no means comparable to ordinary events. It has seriously expressed its intention to renegotiate suitable conditions, so the situation has become serious again. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Union Denies Conditions Agreed Upon in Guangdong</h3>
<p>The Preparatory Committee believes that the resolution of this dispute by the Guangdong side was in the name of the Chinese Seamen's Industrial Federation, which was revoked by the 146th Standing Committee meeting of the Central Government in the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931). The treaty signed by the group that has already been revoked cannot take effect. Furthermore, the content of the conditions includes the entire problem of reorganizing the steerage workers, but the reorganization standards and the exact number of workers remaining on board are not clearly stipulated, which is quite inappropriate. As for all losses of the workers during the strike period, there is no discussion of appropriate compensation, which is not the true meaning of a resolution. Therefore, in addition to sending Secretary Sun Liping to negotiate with the company and strictly correct the Guangdong side, the 20th meeting was held yesterday and the following five measures were resolved: (1) Send a letter to Taikoo Company denying the validity of the conditions agreed upon by the Guangdong side; (2) Report to the central government; (3) Secret; (4) Issue a declaration; (5) Secret. The letter to Taikoo Company denying the conditions agreed upon by the Guangdong side has already been sent out yesterday.</p>
<h3>Officials Sent by the Ministry to Shanghai for Mediation</h3>
<p>The authorities of the Ministry of Communications are also very concerned about the Wusong Wheel case. However, it is heard that after the Guangdong side resolved it, various seamen's groups in Shanghai suddenly opposed it. In order to prevent this case from escalating, Director Gao Tingzi of the Navigation Administration Department and Chairman Yu Senfu of the Labor Affairs Committee were specially sent to Shanghai for mediation. The two arrived in Shanghai yesterday and summoned Zhang Jianri, Secretary Hou Dachun, Sun Liping, and others from the Standing Committee of the Preparatory Committee for a discussion at 2:00 PM to inquire about everything in detail. It is heard that a solution has been drafted. The two will mediate in this matter. If the company has the sincerity to accept it, the case is expected to be resolved soon without escalation.</p>
<h3>Children's Dental Clinic of the Home Industry Cooperative to Open Soon</h3>
<p>The Home Industry Cooperative, founded by the great literary master and veteran journalist Tianxu Wosheng, has been developing its business for more than ten years. It recovers no less than millions of dollars in lost revenues every year, and is indeed the strongest resistor in the domestic goods industry. Now, the cooperative, in view of the fact that the unsound teeth of children are closely related to physical development and the strength of the nation, has proposed a sum of money to prepare for the establishment of a Children's Dental Clinic on the second floor of the Wuchang Pai General Distribution Office, Paobou Field, Nanjing Road, Shanghai. The cooperative has applied to the Municipal Health Bureau for approval, and the bureau has sent Dr. Su Jielang, director of the dental department, to guide the project. It has been preparing for more than three months, and all the equipment is domestic goods, which are extremely perfect. It is also learned that the hospital has hired three German and Japanese dental doctors, and the position of chief physician has been taken by Dr. Gu Hailing, who was introduced by Dr. Su. Dr. Gu studied medicine at the National Tongji University, and in 1928, he went to Germany at his own expense to specialize in dentistry. In the winter of 1933, he passed the German National Dental Examination and obtained the highest grade certificate. At the same time, the University of Erlanggen in Bavaria awarded him a doctorate in dental medicine. His thesis, entitled "The Cause of Whitening of Boiled Blood Culture Medium", was highly praised by the scientific community in Germany. Later, he assisted Professor Ross, a professor at the Dental College of the University of Erlangen, Germany, in oral surgery for many years. His experience and knowledge are outstanding talents in China. After returning to China, he set up a Puji Hospital in Shanghai, embracing the charitable heart of helping the public. For a time, those who sought medical treatment were extremely enthusiastic. Now, Dr. Su sincerely and earnestly helps this cause. Dr. Gu declined to be in charge, as it was a matter of charity, and resolutely sacrificed his already successful Puji Hospital to take charge of the hospital. His enthusiasm for helping others and caring for children is truly rare.</p>
<h3>Jincheng Grand Theater to Open Soon</h3>
<p>The Jincheng Grand Theater, which has been rumored for a long time, has been rushing to build day and night. All the engineering work has been 90% completed. It is expected to open around the end of the Gregorian calendar. The speed of this project has decisively broken the record of all major buildings in Shanghai. If it were not for the careful design of the architects of Huagai and Huaqi and the efforts of Xin Hengtai in building, how could this be achieved? The exterior of the theater is magnificent and majestic, and the interior is exquisite and transparent. The beauty is all-encompassing, and the nobility is followed.

<h3>Shoemaker on Xinzha Road and Hele Lane Suddenly Assassinated - Dispute Arose from Two Apprentices Leaving on Bad Terms - Assailant Dealt a Poisonous Blow, Blood Flowing from Both Chests - Lu Adi's Unexpected Calamity, Dying a Wrongful Death -</h3>
<p>At 9:30 AM yesterday morning, a bloody incident occurred in Hele Lane, Xinzha Road, Public Concession. The victim was a shoemaker who died on the spot due to his injuries. Details of the incident are described below.</p>
<h3>Quarrel Between Two Apprentices</h3>
<p>Chen Jinji Shoe Shop specializes in making leather boots and shoes for major companies. It is located at No. 57 Hele Lane, Xinzha Road, Public Concession, and employs more than 30 shoemakers of all skill levels. However, with so many workers, there is bound to be a variety of characters. Among them is Lu Adi, a native of Pudong, aged 28, who has an apprentice named Zheng Rong, aged 17, learning the trade from him. At the same time, there is also a shoemaker named Xu Miaoxiang in the shop, who also has an apprentice named Xiao Yuanzi, aged 16. Lu and Xu both like to show off, so they have always been at odds. A month ago, Zheng Rong and Xiao Yuanzi suddenly had a quarrel over a trivial matter. Xiao Yuanzi, feeling resentful, first used a knife to slash Zheng Rong's cotton quilt. Zheng Rong, helpless, ran to his master Lu Adi to complain.</p>
<h3>The Result of the Mediation</h3>
<p>Lu, upon learning of this, immediately went to Xu Miaoxiang to reason with him. However, Xu was not one to be trifled with, so nothing came of it. Lu then gathered a group of hooligans and took Xu to a nearby teahouse to mediate. Xu, outnumbered, agreed to pay ten yuan in silver as compensation later. However, Xu only made excuses afterward and never fulfilled the agreement. As a result, Lu again gathered a group to demand the money from Xu. After a disagreement, Xu was slapped several times by the hooligans. Xu, feeling humiliated, was furious and ran to Lu Adi's father, Chen Gengsheng, to complain. Chen stepped in to mediate, ordering Xu to reduce the compensation by four yuan, and the matter was settled.</p>
<h3>Masters and Apprentices Suddenly Quit</h3>
<p>However, Xu still harbored resentment. The day before yesterday was the day the shop paid wages. Unexpectedly, that evening, Xu suddenly resigned from the shop of his own accord, and when he left, he also ordered his apprentice Xiao Yuanzi to leave with him. They had not returned to the shop until last night. At about 8:00 AM yesterday morning, the shop workers and Lu Adi all went to the Quan'an Teahouse near Xinzha Bridge for tea, and they all found it strange that Xu Miaoxiang and his apprentice had suddenly quit. Around 9:00 AM, the workers saw that it was time to work and left one after another. Lu also followed the crowd and walked alone into Hele Lane. Lu suddenly felt a need to relieve himself, so he went to the public lavatory there.</p>
<h3>Assassinated and Killed</h3>
<p>Unexpectedly, at this moment, two assailants suddenly rushed forward. Seeing Lu squatting down, they immediately drew sharp blades from their sleeves and stabbed Lu twice in the left and right chest before fleeing. After being stabbed, Lu bravely stood up and tried to escape into the lane, but after only a few steps, he fell near the back door of Shunchang Tizhuang. Fortunately, Lu's colleague Gong Langen caught sight of him and rushed over to check. Lu was already on his last breath, blood gushing from his clothes. Gong knew something was wrong and rushed to report the incident to the police station at No. 847 nearby and then to the police station. The police quickly dispatched detectives to investigate and rushed Lu to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, because the injuries were in vital areas, he died on the way. The hospital notified the police station to transfer the body to the coroner's office, and reported to the court for examination. Meanwhile, detectives were dispatched to hunt down the killer and bring him to justice.</p>
<h3>Shen Linghua's Autopsy Results Confirm It Was Not Suicide - Caused by Internal Injuries from Beatings - Then Hung on a Tree to Die</h3>
<p>Shen Linghua, a tailor from Yaojia Bridge in Yinxiang District, was involved when his partner, Xun Linsheng, introduced a widow, Wu Qiaoshi, for illicit relations with Min Zixiang and Min Wangshi, a married couple. The widow had a former lover named Zhu Along, who, out of jealousy, demanded money from Dong but was refused. He then attacked Dong with a knife at night. At the same time, Shen Linghua suddenly disappeared, and the next morning, his body was found hanging from a tree at the end of Huasheng Road. The local bailiff, Chen Bingsong, reported it to the local court as a suicide. According to the legal examination, the deceased had no external injuries on his body, and the rope marks on his neck were clear, confirming the suicide. After the body was collected, the family went to the court to accuse others, claiming that Shen Linghua had been taken away by the murderers while trying to mediate, that his leg bones had been cut, and he had been injured to death. Afterward, they faked a suicide to cover it up. To be cautious, the prosecutor sent the body to the Zhenru Forensic Institute for an autopsy. Yesterday, the coffin was opened, and the body was examined. There were no signs of knife cuts, but although there were clear marks on the neck, the trachea was not severed, indicating that it was not a suicide. Therefore, an autopsy was performed, revealing that the intestines, liver, and kidneys in the abdomen had been damaged, indicating severe injuries. It appeared that he had died from internal injuries caused by beatings. While his body was still warm, his blood had not yet dissipated, and his breath was not completely gone, a rope was immediately put around his neck and hung up to make it look like a suicide. Therefore, there were still rope marks on his neck. It must have been the design of a cunning person. The truth is now clear, but the main cause is still not possible to make an accurate judgment. Therefore, the intestines and liver were taken out, and a definite identification will be made after chemical testing. As for Min Wangshi, Wu Qiaoshi, etc., they have been escorted by the police to the court for detention, and at the same time, the court has ordered the arrest of Zhu Along and others for investigation.</p>

<h3>Two Public Docks to be Built at Wusong Yunzaobang - Ferry Terminal Nears Completion</h3>
<p>Wusong Yunzaobang is an important waterway for ships to come and go, and waterborne commerce and cargo handling are also concentrated here. The docks previously donated by shops and private individuals (formerly known as the Stone Docks) were destroyed in the January 28th Incident. Business firms are unable to repair them, and currently ships feel extremely inconvenient when loading and unloading cargo. In order to facilitate the loading and unloading of goods for ships, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works first rebuilt two public docks on both sides of the old site of Laoda Bridge at the western end of Yunzaobang, which have already been completed. The municipal ferry terminal being built at the eastern end is very large in scale and is expected to be completed by the end of the year. Starting on New Year's Day next year, the municipal ferry will operate special Songhu routes, greatly facilitating merchants and travelers, and transportation.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Puller Attempts to Indecently Assault a Young Woman in a Crisis Where No Delay is Permitted - Pulls the Rickshaw to a Remote Place and Attempts Forcible Rape - Fortunately, a Road Worker Comes to the Rescue - Shanghai is Full of Crises, a Clear Example -</h3>
<p>Shi Xiuying, a woman from Changzhou, 21 years old, of some beauty, has been a worker at the Third Shanghai Cotton Mill. Her home is at No. 12 Yiren Lane, Yangshupu Road. Recently, due to some business, she returned to her hometown and arrived in Shanghai by Jinghu train at 6:00 AM the day before yesterday, carrying a package of clothes and sundries. She hired a rickshaw numbered 8006 driven by Xun Wenjin, a 25-year-old from Yancheng, to return home. Xun, seeing that Miss Shi was petite and charming and had come to Shanghai from the countryside, thought she could be deceived, and suddenly had evil intentions. The rickshaw went far towards the quiet area of Qiwupu Road. Miss Shi, familiar with the route, said, "Why are you going the long way?" Xun replied, "The near road is currently under construction by the Municipal Council, and cars and trams are allowed to pass, but rickshaws are not." The woman believed him and did not suspect anything else. After a while, the rickshaw arrived at a remote area near Yangshupu Bridge on Lan Road, where there were no streetlights. Xun stopped the rickshaw and said that he wanted to take a match from the rickshaw box to light the lamp. It was already 7:00 PM, and he asked the woman to get out of the rickshaw temporarily. He seized the opportunity to violently push the woman to the ground. The woman knew something was wrong and shouted for help. Xun used his right hand to cover the woman's mouth, but she bit him, and he withdrew. He then covered the woman's head with an oilcloth, stripped off her pants, and attempted to rape her. At this critical moment, a road worker named Zhang Agen from Jiangbei passed by. Xun panicked and tried to escape. The woman jumped up and, seeing Zhang Agen, cried out, "Uncle, save me!" Zhang grabbed Xun and took him to Songpan Road, handing him over to Chinese Constable No. 2745 on duty, who took him to the Yangshupu Police Station. The head constable was informed and ordered him to be detained. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the details of the case. Subsequently, Shi Xiuying testified about what had happened. When questioned, the defendant denied the accusations, saying that the woman asked him to pull the rickshaw closer to Yiren Lane, but when he refused, she attacked him first, slapping him in the face and starting a mutual fight. He denied any attempted rape. Other statements were evasive. Police lawyer Zhang said that there was no way Miss Shi would falsely accuse him of something so shameful. Zhang Agen testified that it was dark at the time, and the defendant was already standing aside, and Shi held onto him. The defendant wanted to beat her to death and refused to admit the attempted rape, etc. Judge Liu Yugui ordered him to be detained and scheduled a date for sentencing.</p>
<h3>Trial Sales of Fruit Exports Attract Considerable Attention Domestically and Abroad</h3>
<p>Since Director He and Chief Officer Ji of the International Trade Bureau advocated trial sales of fruit in Liverpool, it has attracted considerable attention from fruit merchants at home and abroad. They have sent letters to the bureau's guidance department inquiring about shipping schedules, types, quantities, and other items for export. The bureau recently received a letter from Shantou Gongyu Company, saying that it is willing to try selling honey oranges from the area to the UK, and asking to introduce famous and reliable fruit merchants in the area in order to proceed.</p>
<h3>Gave Birth to a Child Just Two Months After Marriage - Zhang Yizhen Was Divorced by Her Husband's Family - Only Then Did She Learn That She Was Seduced and Impregnated by Ye Shaoyun - Slept Together Twice at the Yuedong Hotel -</h3>
<p>Zhang Hanqing, a native of Dongting Mountain, living at No. 14 Longqing Lane, Ningbo Road, in the Public Concession, is 42 years old and works as a partner at the Yingchang Yarn Shop. He has a daughter named Yizhen, who is 22 years old this year and has some beauty. On April 21st of this year, she married He Kangqu through a matchmaker. Unexpectedly, Zhang's daughter gave birth to a child just two months after the marriage. The husband's family believed that Zhang's daughter was unchaste before marriage, and that giving birth so soon after the wedding would be scandalous. Therefore, they sent the daughter back to Zhang's family to argue. Zhang then learned that his daughter had been seduced by Ye Shaoyun (24 years old this year, working as a bill collector at the Xiangtai Timber Company, residing at No. 1 Renshou Lane, Annaquin Road, French Concession), the nephew of his brother-in-law Wang Liangchu, who had lured her out and slept with her twice at the Yuedong Second Hotel on Yong'an Street, resulting in her pregnancy. Feeling unconvinced, Zhang, as the legal guardian, hired lawyer Song Mingxun to sue Ye Shaoyun for the crime of seduction in the Second Special District Court. Judge Zhang Chaozu heard the case once. Now, Judge Zhang has been transferred to the Civil Division of the Third High Branch Court, so the case has been transferred to Wu Fanglian. Yesterday, Judge Wu announced a new trial in the Fifth Court. First, the plaintiff's lawyer, Song Mingxun, stated the grounds for the lawsuit, saying that the defendant used deception to seduce and rape, committing a crime under Article 315, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. The first time, on July 14th of last year, the seduced person was under the legal age of 20, which also violated Article 257, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. He requested that the law be followed in handling the case, and that the plaintiff's daughter, since being raped, had been deemed unchaste by her husband's family and sent back, losing her home for life. According to Article 195 of the Civil Law, the defendant should be held responsible for the illegal damages to her body and reputation, and he requested additional damages of 6,000 yuan. Then, Zhang Yizhen was questioned, saying that on July 14th and September 14th of the old calendar year, the defendant twice tricked me into going to the Yuedong Hotel and opening rooms 106 and 103 for sexual relations. We separated the next morning. At that time, the defendant asked me to find a way to cancel the engagement with the He family. He would send another aunt to be a matchmaker, but if I refused, there would be danger to my life. Later, I felt that I was pregnant, and I told the defendant. The defendant first gave me musk to swallow, wanting to abort the fetus, but it didn't work. Later, I also ate alum, but it also didn't work. He ruined my reputation. I ask for a heavy sentence. When Ye Shaoyun was questioned, he replied that he never had sexual relations with Zhang Yizhen in a room. He requested an investigation. The plaintiff's lawyer also stated that my lawyer had sent someone to the Yuedong Hotel to check and found that on the registration book for the first time opening the room, Ye Weijun, one male and one female was written, and the second time wrote Ye Jun, one male and one female, clearly showing that the defendant was undoubtedly seducing and raping. The evidence is solid, and there is no room for denial. After a long time of questioning, the official instructed that the case still needed to be investigated in detail, and then ordered a postponement for further questioning.</p>

<h3>Shanghai National Products Company Implements Second Plan and Holds a Reunion Banquet</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai National Products Company implemented its expansion plan on September 1st, its business has been developing day by day. The business objectives planned to be completed in six months have been achieved in the third month. Therefore, the company has decided to implement the second plan ahead of schedule this month. Wu Zhihao, the general manager of the company, held a reunion banquet for all employees at the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association Hall the day before yesterday, both to celebrate the success of the first plan and to encourage those who are working hard for the second plan. More than 500 people attended. First, Wu Zhihao delivered a speech, saying that since the company opened last November, there has been no company on Nanjing Road that completely sells national products. The company was in a position of struggling alone. Fortunately, everyone worked hard and their spirit was tireless. Thanks to the common care of enthusiastic people in society, it was able to thrive. Today, on Nanjing Road, national product companies have been established one after another. There are the National Products Bargain Market, China National Products Company, and the Central National Products Market, all with the determination to embrace economic self-defense and jointly fight for the survival of national products. This is truly a comforting thing in the midst of national crisis. Today's attendees deeply understand the value of past efforts. If we want to save the country and resist strong enemies, it is impossible to achieve results with empty words. We must do it in a practical way, negatively not buying enemy goods, and positively promoting national products. We must know that the development of national products means that money will not flow out, which is related to national strength and people's livelihood. The expansion plan implemented by the company in September of this year is somewhat gratifying in terms of business. Now we need to implement the second plan. Mr. Ren Jinpin, who is in charge of the plan, is unable to participate in the banquet due to business in Beijing, but Mr. Lu Qisheng will be able to explain it to everyone in detail and contribute opinions, so that the effectiveness of the plan can increase more quickly every day. Next, Lu Qisheng gave a speech, saying that this company is the earliest national product company founded on Nanjing Road. It was only 81 days from the opening on November 5th last year to the end of the lunar year, and the business was very developed. Since the implementation of the expansion plan on September 1st this year, the business has become even more developed. Thanks to the enthusiastic support of all sectors and the hard work of everyone, the business objectives have been achieved in the third month. Therefore, the second plan is now being implemented ahead of schedule, on the one hand, to seek the development of the company's own business, and on the other hand, to prepare to unite with other companies that completely sell national products to cooperate in order to create a united front to promote national products. Although our country is currently suffering from national disasters and cannot fight the enemy to the death to avenge our hatred, there will be a day of fighting to the death to avenge our hatred. Promoting national products is the only way to develop production and cultivate national strength. Everyone is serving the national product company, working hard to promote national products, which is practical work to save the country. After Wu and Lu finished their speeches, domestic films and colleagues performing songs, dances, and Peking opera on stage were screened, and the banquet ended in joy around 1:00 AM.</p>
<h3>Lake Society Pays Tribute to Zhou Xiangling</h3>
<p>Zhou Xiangling of Huzhou was a prolific writer, famous far and wide. Throughout his life, he was happy to help with the public welfare undertakings of his hometown, and the locals admired him. Unexpectedly, his old illness relapsed, and he died of illness at his Shanghai residence at 6:00 PM on the 7th of this month, which was deeply mourned by those who heard the news. When the Lake Society raised funds to build the society's headquarters, it appointed Zhou to lead the Ditang team, and the results were excellent. Now that the society has received this news, it has specifically appointed two executive committee members to pay tribute and send a letter to Zhou's eldest son to express condolences. The original letter is now copied below: Mr. Jianchu, the news of the bad news spread, and I was shocked to learn that your father had passed away. I am filled with sorrow. I think that Mr. Xiangling's life was full of good words and deeds, and his name was well-known in his hometown. Famous people and gentlemen all respected him. The society's construction is in full swing, and we were looking forward to his assistance. We suddenly lost a good model, and the pain is even greater. Moreover, Mr. He has a strong brotherhood and has a reputation for filial piety. He has suffered a great misfortune and his grief must be overwhelming. We offer flowers and specifically send Committee Member Yan Junxuan and Committee Member Ling Songru to represent all the members of the society to pay tribute and express our condolences. I hope you will restrain your grief and console the dead in heaven. We respectfully send our condolences and await your response.</p>
<p>After the Water Was Cut Off in Baifu and Other Three Lanes</p>
<h3>Property Owner Notifies Insurance Companies Yesterday - Unimaginable if a Fire Occurs Please Negotiate Quickly</h3>
<p>Deli Company, the owner of Baifu, Balu, and Baishou Lanes between Pingliang Road and Yangzhou Road in Pudong, stated that British Shanghai Waterworks Company had removed the three water meters installed in the lane and cut off the Taiping fire hydrants in the lane worth more than 2,000 taels of silver. As if this was not enough, they placed the lives of more than 2,000 people in the lane in danger and closed the main water pipe of the Taiping fire hydrant on the road, making the lane feel like a dry ditch. The property owner said that once a fire occurs, the burning of the houses is a small matter, and the lives of more than 2,000 people are in danger. Yesterday, they specifically sent letters to Tianxiang and Jinlong Insurance Companies, the fire insurance companies that insured the lane, informing them of the current water cut-off situation and the future dangers. If there is any fire loss, your company must be responsible for compensation. Otherwise, please protest to the British Shanghai Waterworks Company and restore the Taiping fire hydrants, etc. The lane's daily water use is still drawn from the Huangpu River. The lane's artesian well project has not yet been fully completed. However, as an emergency measure, it may be temporarily used in the next few days. As for the tenant aspect, the property owner has raised objections, and Huang Chenglong, the lawyer representing the tenants in the lane, is mediating, and it is hoped that no litigation will be involved.</p>
<h3>Commemorative Grand Sale at Tongchang Bicycle Shop - 100 Bicycles to be Given Away</h3>

In addition to drastically reducing prices on all kinds of vehicles, they are also offering valuable commemorative gifts from various European and American manufacturers to their patrons. These gifts are indeed valuable and surpass those of other well-known establishments. It is reported that during the sale period, the shop is giving away 100 "Tongchang Flying Man" bicycles. The process is very simple: by spending one dollar to purchase a permanent free repair certificate, one gains the hope of winning a bicycle.

<h3>Publication of "A Scientist's Record of Spiritual Communication"</h3>
<p>"Does the spirit cease to exist after death?" This is a major question that everyone, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, has been eager to answer but found difficult to resolve. Without scientific scrutiny, it is difficult to solve. Mr. Yapheth Lyttleton of England, with the spirit of "Bring the evidence" and unwavering determination, spent twelve years accumulating forty-three instances of two hundred and eighty-three personally experienced and conclusive results, proving that the spirit still exists after death. How heart-stirring this is! He wrote his experimental results into a book, which was published in England. Within a year, it was reprinted as many as thirty times, which shows how popular it was with the public. It has now been translated into Chinese by the Shanghai World News Agency under the title "A Scientist's Record of Spiritual Communication," and is published by the agency (140 Anjili, Moore Road, Shanghai). The actual price is eight dimes per copy, with an additional two and a half cents for postage outside Shanghai, and another eight cents for registration.

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor of Shenbao:</p>
<p>Regarding the news in your newspaper about the Yong An Company robbery, which stated that it was related to an employee of our company's foreign goods department, this is not in accordance with the facts. It is true that the police arrested Hu Chongshan, a salesman in the Western clothing department, yesterday morning. However, upon investigation, this employee also goes by the names of Hu Chao, Hu Xikang, Hu Shan, and Hu Zengli. He has worked in major companies in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tianjin, and other cities for over twenty years. He resigned from the Yong An Company last year and applied for a position at our company in May of this year, working as a salesman in the Western clothing department attached to our foreign goods piece goods department for only three months. We hope that your newspaper will correct the record based on the facts.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h3>Preparatory Meeting of the General Association of Chinese Boy Scouts</h3>
<p>The preparatory office of the General Association of Chinese Boy Scouts held a preparatory meeting on the afternoon of the 7th. Zhu Jia-hua, Duanmu Jie, Gui Yongqing, Gu Shusen, Zhang Jun, and others were present. Zhu Jia-hua chaired the meeting, and the following matters were discussed: (1) The Jiangsu Provincial Council submitted a request for the issuance of a portion of the registration fees due to the provincial and county councils before June of this year.

(2) The Jiangsu Provincial Council submitted the regulations for raising funds to build the council's office building and requested a subsidy of 1,000 yuan, as had been done in the past. How should this be handled? (The fundraising method should be carried out by Boy Scout service members and Boy Scouts themselves, without soliciting donations from outside. There is no precedent for a subsidy, so there is no need to discuss it.) (3) The Jiangsu Provincial Council suggested that the registration fees for group departments and service members be distributed and managed in accordance with the distribution and management methods for Boy Scout registration fees. Should this be approved? (Handle in accordance with previous orders.) (4) Mr. Du Tingxiu submitted the completed scores for the Chinese Boy Scout song and the Wildfire song and requested a review. (Please have Mr. Tang Xueyong review it.) (5) Should candidates be nominated to draft the election rules for all levels of the council?

<h3>The Mass Education Plan Will Be Difficult to Announce This Month</h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Education drafted the mass education plan and announced that it would convene the second general meeting of the Mass Education Committee (after the Ministry of Education formed the Mass Education Committee and hired Niu Tangsheng, Gao JianSi, Liang Shuming, and more than ten other people as committee members, it had held its first general meeting), all parties have paid close attention to this matter because mass education is related to eliminating illiteracy. It is said that the second revision of this mass education plan has been completed and is being reviewed by the minister. After it is sent to the relevant department, the Ministry of Education will send letters to the committee members of the Mass Education Committee and issue notices to the provinces and cities, asking them to sign their opinions separately. After about two or three weeks, all parties' opinions will be gathered and discussed at a meeting. Therefore, it will be difficult to announce the mass education plan this month, and the meeting of the Mass Education Committee will have to be held in the latter half of this month at the earliest, and the date has not yet been set.</p>

<h3>The Jiangxi Provincial Government Actively Promotes Mass Education and Decides to Increase Mass Education Funding Starting This Year</h3>
<p>(Nanchang Correspondence) The Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education believes that mass education is of utmost importance, so it has decided to actively promote mass education starting this year, issuing notices to all counties to establish mass education committees within a limited time, urging them to increase the number of mass schools. However, funding is the mother of all undertakings, and it will be difficult to achieve results without finding ways to increase funding. It is now decided that starting this year, mass education funding will be gradually increased, with the goal of reaching 10% of the total educational funding within three years, in order to promote development. All counties are also notified that they should follow this standard and find ways to increase funding: (1) Raise as much funding as possible from local education funds, ensuring that social education funding for this year reaches at least 6% or more, and those that exceed this amount should not be reduced. (2) Local governments should consider the situation and request the government to allocate official and public property or levy additional taxes specifically for mass education. (3) Give more encouragement to those who donate to support education, in order to achieve the goal of mass education being taught and learned by the masses themselves.</p>
<h3>The Shandong Provincial Government Will Follow the Revised Central Government's Examination Regulations for This Year's Middle School Entrance Examination—The Province Is Divided into Thirteen Districts</h3>
<p>(Jinan Express) The Shandong Provincial Department of Education's Examination Committee is preparing for the third middle school graduation examination and has submitted the methods for dividing the districts to the Ministry of Education for review. The department recently received an order from the Ministry of Education stating that various regulations for the examination have been changed. The department held a plenary committee meeting yesterday (the 5th). Wang Ziyu, Kong Lingcan, Lai Zhizhong, Pi Dawu, Shao Xiufeng, Wang Ye, Liu Cizhen, and He Chengyu attended. Kong Lingcan chaired the meeting, and Fang Zhongyi was the recorder. After the meeting, the committee discussed the Ministry of Education's revised examination regulations, including the decision to exempt middle school students from re-examination and elementary school students from all examinations, and decided to comply. However, there were difficulties in revising the organizational structure of the Examination Committee for each session and setting the examination dates (the last week of June for the summer examination and the first week of January for the winter examination) due to insufficient preparation time. This point could be flexibly handled. Students who failed the previous examination were originally scheduled to participate in the re-examination at this year's examination. Now that the Ministry of Education has ordered that middle school students be exempted from re-examination, it has been decided to allow them to participate in the preliminary examination. Regarding the method of dividing the districts for this year's examination, it is said that because the number of participating schools and graduating students is less than in the previous session, the province will only be divided into thirteen districts.</p>
<h3>President Xu of Pingda Prepares for Handover</h3>

<h3>The Free Screening of the Educational Film Association Has Begun - A Fee for Vehicle and Explanatory Brochure to be Applied</h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Chinese Educational Film Association was entrusted by the general association to implement educational films in Shanghai. The association immediately formulated measures, with screening in schools at all levels as the initial step. Due to the high cost, a fee was initially set. Now, in order to promote popularization, the association has repeatedly negotiated with the National Educational Film Promotion Office and obtained free educational films. Therefore, free screenings will be held starting this month in order to fulfill the original intention of not charging fees. However, because there are too many schools and they are distributed in various districts, it is necessary to hire vehicles to save time. Therefore, a fee for the vehicle and the printing of explanatory brochures will be charged to cover costs. Schools that have previously been charged screening fees will continue to be screened and will not be charged any additional fees.</p>
<h3>Peiming and Daxia Schools Implement Work-Study Education - Purchasing Machines to Guide Students in Spinning and Weaving</h3>
<p>Peiming Women's Middle School in Shanghai became interested in weaving native cloth after Tai Shuangqiu gave a lecture at the school. They then entrusted the Shanghai County Farmers' Education Center to manufacture a full set of weaving machines, spinning wheels, and other tools and donated them to the school. Students are guided in spinning and weaving during work-study class and after school. Students at Daxia University are also very enthusiastic about promoting native cloth and have recently purchased machines from the County Farmers' Education Center and are learning to weave cloth after school, and they have invited Zhang Chengzhu from the Farmers' Education Center to teach.</p>
<h3>Zheng Zhenwen, the County Magistrate of Fujian Education, Arrives in Shanghai to Discuss the Recent Situation of the Fujian Incident - The Educational Administration in Fujian Is Chaotic - The Pseudo-Organization's Fundraising Method Is Bizarre</h3>
<p>After the Fujian Incident occurred, most of the members of the Fujian Provincial Government were unwilling to join the rebels and fled to Shanghai. However, Zheng Zhenwen, the provincial committee member and director of the Education Department, remained in Fujian for a long time. Zheng previously worked as an editor at the Commercial Press in Shanghai and was introduced to Fujian by Lin Sen, the chairman of the National Government, when the Fujian Provincial Government was reorganized. Therefore, there has been much speculation from the outside world. It is learned that Zheng and Xiao Shuxuan (the former brigade commander of the provincial defense army, who was transferred to this position after being reorganized by the 19th Route Army and has now resigned), the director of the Fujian Regiment Training Institute, arrived in Shanghai from Fujian on the 7th. A reporter from the Daily News specially visited Zheng at his private residence and immediately asked about the recent situation in Fujian. Zheng informed him in great detail, and the following is a record:</p>
<h3>The Reason for My Delayed Departure from Fujian</h3>
<p>Zheng first stated that after the Fujian Incident occurred, the pseudo-organization coerced him to serve as the director of the Mass Education Center (which he did not accept). He was unwilling to witness the acts of destroying the party and rebelling against the country and wanted to resign and escape the clutches of the tiger as soon as possible. However, in order for the education community to understand the educational funding during his tenure and the process of reorganizing education in Fujian, he had to remain in Fujian for the shortest possible period to handle these procedures. Now that he has completed them, he secretly left Fujian and came to Shanghai the other day and plans to go to Nanjing soon to report everything to the central government.</p>
<h3>Educational Administration Is Chaotic</h3>
<p>As for the current educational administration in Fujian, it is chaotic and unspeakable. When he resigned, all of the seals, documents, and files of the Education Department were originally received by the Cultural Section (i.e., the Education Department) of the reorganized provincial government. Then, people from the Cultural Affairs Committee occupied it in advance, causing many disputes and conflicts. The former office building of the Director of the Education Department was also occupied by the chairman of the Cultural Affairs Committee. They have now been in possession for more than ten days, but no administrative matters have been handled at all. The other day, the Cultural Affairs Committee suddenly issued a notice stating that the principals of middle schools and above should be reappointed by the committee. It is said that a large number of lower-level members of the Social Democratic Party will be installed.</p>
<h3>The People's Government's Fundraising Method</h3>
<p>During the conversation, Zheng also mentioned that the pseudo-organization's fundraising methods were bizarre and ridiculous. There are widespread rumors that the Fujian side borrowed money from the Japanese, which is a confidential matter that he dares not confirm. However, due to a lack of operating funds, the pseudo-organization recently issued an order to the Public Security Bureau to force every household in the city, regardless of whether they are shops or residences, to purchase a flag of the Republic of the中華人民共和國, costing two dollars. People are not allowed to manufacture them privately, and those who violate this rule will be severely punished. It is said that the cost of manufacturing each flag is only forty cents, so the government can earn a profit of one dollar and sixty cents for each flag sold, which is quite a good calculation.</p>
<h3>Academic Lecture at the Vocational Education Society - Zhang Yi Will Lecture Today</h3>
<p>The academic lecture established by the中華職業教育社 will be held today at 4:30 PM for the ninth lecture of the sixth session. The lecturer is Mr. Zhang Yousan, and the topic is "Youth Self-Cultivation." Mr. Zhang is currently the chairman of the Department of Education at Fuli University and has profound academic knowledge and rich experience. The society welcomes people from all walks of life to attend the lecture.</p>

A total of fifteen participants started from the gate of Minli University, passed through the Old West Gate, entered Heping Road, Lafayette Road, turned left onto Luban Road, and went straight to Lujiiawan. They returned via Xieqiao, Lujiabang, and the Small West Gate. The entire course was approximately 5,000 meters long. They started at half past six. Wu Chunyuan took the lead, walking like the wind. After passing the Old West Gate, Wang Zesui accelerated his pace, closely following behind. At Aurora University on Luban Road, the road was muddy, making it difficult to run fast. Wu Chunyuan, being slightly careless, fell, and Wang Huasui surpassed him to take first place. However, Mr. Wu was ultimately an expert in this field. By the time they reached Yuqiao, he had come from behind, winning first place with a time of 18 minutes and 32 seconds. The rankings are attached below: 1.

<h3>The French Concession's Vesta Has a Dramatic Battle</h3>
<p>The Donghua Football Club has lost twice and drawn once in the Group A matches, and its hopes for the championship seem to have diminished. However, if it can maintain consistent victories in the future, it may still be able to salvage the situation. The team's best hope is the Shigaota Cup, and the teams with the best chance of winning the cup are Vesta, French Gao, and Donghua. The match between the French Concession and Vesta is scheduled to take place first this afternoon.

<h3>Xiqing Basketball Last Night: Jinan Strenuously Resisted Mailing—Lost 23 to 49—Mailing Won Against All Teams in Group B; There Are Eight Matches Today</h3>
<p>Last night's Xiqing basketball game between Jinan and Mailing was the most exciting. The beauty and intensity of the battle were within expectations. In the first half, Jinan was extremely energetic, but in the second half, it finally declined sharply due to its weaker strength. As a result, the score was 49 to 23. In addition, there were two Group B matches. Mailing defeated Wing Team, 26 to 24, and St. John's Middle School defeated Rowing, 28 to 17. The description of each match is briefly described as follows:</p>
<h3>Wing Team Lost After Winning</h3>
<p>In the Group B match between Wing Team and Mailing, Wing Team cooperated extremely well in the first half. The forwards' skills were quite accurate, and Mailing was always subdued. The result was 21 to 15. At the beginning of the second half, Mailing tried hard to attack, but Wing Team lacked stamina and suffered setbacks. They only scored three points before and after, which was extremely bleak. In total, Wing Team lost with a score of 26 to 24.</p>
<h3>St. John's Always Led</h3>
<p>The second Group B match between St. John's Middle School and Rowing was also very tense. St. John's had many skilled players, and Xu Wenkui's activity and the rapid progress of the entire team overwhelmed Rowing from beginning to end. The score was 21 to 17 in the first half, and 16 to 28 in the overall result, with St. John's winning.</p>
<p>St. John's Fouls Points Rowing Fouls Points</p>
<p>Li Mingguang 2 4 Hai Xueke 0 13</p>
<p>Xu Wenkui 22 Qiong Musi 1 5</p>

<p>Tong Yuchun 3 4 Pan Ni 4 4</p>
<p>Zhang Peixin 1 6 Gailaiman 0 0</p>
<p>Total 9 36 Total 6 26</p>
<h3>Mailing's Victory Was Not Easy</h3>
<p>The Jinan-Mailing match was very meaningful. According to both teams, they are both fierce armies, especially Mailing. This session is strong and powerful, and has the ambition to suppress pirates and dominate the sea. Although Jinan's strength is relatively inferior, its military appearance is also extremely tight. Under the battle, you come and go, and it is difficult to distinguish each other. Mailing is fierce and terrifying, while Jinan is astute. Therefore, the instability of the score indicates the tension during the battle. After reaching a 7-7 tie, Mailing could not attack for a long time, and Pi Xiaopo also came on the court to help. Yin Guiren then got a penalty kick opportunity and scored two more points, leading the way. Before long, Mailing scored again with free throws and throws, exceeding again. Jinan was heavily guarded by the enemy, making it difficult to develop, and could only follow closely. The result of the first half was 17 to 13, with Mailing taking a four-point lead. At the beginning of the second half, Mailing's forwards replaced fresh troops. Jinan was also unwilling to show weakness and waited in strict formation. Within five minutes, both sides had gained something, and the score remained normal. Soon, Wu Nanzhen committed a foul and was penalized two goals for the first time. Afterwards, they continued to lose ground. As a result, Jinan fell into an unfavorable situation. Mailing responded to every request, and in an instant, it had led 38 to 22. Xu Henggong and Wan Yu also came on the court to serve as defenders, but it was too late and the general trend was gone. The overall result was 49 to 23.</p>

<h3>Chih-Chih Night Ping-Pong Team Established</h3>
<p>More than ten students from the Department of Law of Chih-Chih College have organized a Night Ping-Pong Team, which was established the day before yesterday. At the beginning of the team's establishment, they are willing to have practice matches with advanced teams in this city. Anyone who is interested in contacting the association can send a letter to Mr. Liu Tongbao, No. 259 Kunshan Road.</p>
<h3>There is Talk of Li Huitang Coming to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Since Lehua was eliminated, football king Li Huitang bid farewell to people in Shanghai. It has been more than two years since then. Although fans in Shanghai have not seen Mr. Li in person, they never forget Mr. Li's football skills. In the past two years, Mr. Li and Dai Linjing have both played for the Chinese Qunli Football Team in Java, arousing unusual excitement in the overseas Chinese community for football. Mr. Dai arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and joined Donghua. Fans are very happy. Now I heard that Mr. Li Huitang will also come to Shanghai soon to join Donghua, but it cannot be confirmed yet. If so, it will not only be a blessing for Donghua, but all fans will be extremely excited.</p>
<h3>The Sports Association and Xilian Association Jointly Reopen the Zhongyuan Football Field; The Field Arrangement Has Been Gradually Completed; Important Matches Will Be Moved to Be Held There</h3>
<p>The former Shenyuan Dog Racing Field was once borrowed by the Xilian Football Club for football matches. Later, because the Public Concession prohibited dog racing, Shenyuan was also closed. The Yiyuan Dog Racing Field in the French Concession took over. The Xilian Football Club, in view of the lack of football fields, once again borrowed the venue from Yiyuan for football matches. Therefore, most of the major matches are now held in Yiyuan, and some are held in the China Baseball Field. However, the rumor that the baseball field will be taken back by the landlord has been raging recently. Although it has not yet reached a mature stage, the Sports Promotion Association is constantly trying to find another venue. But Shanghai is a place where every inch of land is worth gold, and it is not easy to find a way. Later, I learned that the Shenyuan field was still abandoned. The Sports Promotion Association then discussed with the Xilian Football Club to jointly rent the Shenyuan field for football matches. After obtaining the landlord's consent, construction began and it will be completed within a few days. It can be used in the New Year. The contract is rumored to be for a period of six months. In the future, all international football, international football, and other major football matches will be moved to the field. All long-term gifts and coupons of the Xilian Football Club and the Sports Promotion Association can be used.</p>
<h3>Joint Meeting of the China Table Tennis Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai China Table Tennis Federation held its first joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees in the first session yesterday at the Jiande Association. Xu Duo, Hu Jiankun, Lu Xiulu, Cao Zhendong, Liu Keren, Kang Jiwen, Lu Zhongqiu, Liu Guoxiong, Chen Linsheng, and Lin Rongji (Cheng Zhihong, substitute) were present. Xu Duo was elected as the chairman and Hu Jianzhou as the recorder. First, the chairman reported on the future policy of this session and various matters related to the second session of the United Cup Competition. Then, discussions began and various important cases were resolved as follows: (1) The competition documents, accounting, communication, and affairs were divided into five sections. (2) With the United Cup about to start, the affairs section should conduct an investigation into whether the competition venues are suitable. (3) The competition start date will be decided and announced by the competition section. (4) The office of the association is the Chinese Jiande Association. (5) Issue group membership certificates.

The clothing must be neat and tidy when taking photos (jerseys for the upper body and shorts for the lower body). Each team should also prepare a team flag.</p>
<p>Special Article</p>
<h3>The Course of the Paris Chinese Painting Exhibition (7)</h3>
<p>In the National Art and Architecture Magazine (June issue), Meng Duowa Hong wrote: In the bright room on the first floor of the Rodbaum Museum, a recent exhibition of ancient and modern Chinese art. I only discuss its ancient paintings, because Europeans have always regarded the art of painting as their unique secret. Today, the ancient Chinese paintings give us "opposite" lessons and make us realize a lesson of shame. My feelings about visiting the Chinese painting exhibition can be encompassed by the words of Sayer and Helio. A young man who had just come to France from Peiping once said to Sayer, "Among these paintings, do you know what I like? It is the portrait of the wild bull that decorates Aitamira...". Mr. He said that what he admired about Chinese art was that it was a reflection of all the delicacy, all the colors, and all the refinement of an extremely civilized thought. I visited the exhibition twice in a few days, because the first time I was in a heated mood, and I was afraid of being affected by the beautiful morning light in June, so my feelings were close to superficial. However, the second time I appreciated it, I still got the same pleasure. China's special methods, whether mural paintings, silk paintings, or paper paintings, can be summed up in one sentence: There is extremely strict sketching, and its coloring is appropriate for the human body and other main parts. As for modern Chinese writers, such as Ren Bonian's banana trees are skillful and stable works, and Chen Shuren, Qi Baishi, and Zhang Shuqi are also excellent. And Xu Beihong's ancient cypress and rooster are full of vitality, I regret not getting the original, so I bought a print as a souvenir. Lin Fengmian's chicken is also very beautiful in color. Is my comment on the Chinese painting exhibition appropriate? If readers can sacrifice a moment to go and see it, they will know that this magazine cannot but write an introduction to this unique exhibition, to this thirteenth century of amazing art, which is only known to a very few people.</p>

<p>Welcome Marconi Special Issue</p>
<h3>Welcome Marconi to China</h3>
<p>— Reporter</p>
<p>Guglielmo Marconi, the inventor of radio, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. How happy and warmly welcomed are the Chinese radio comrades to hear this news?</p>
<p>Marconi is now commonly respected as the inventor of radio. Although there were researchers of radio before Marconi, such as Maxwell, Right, Hertz, and Branly, there were only empty theories, and no real experiments. Until Marconi came out, he alone held his genius, and created applicable instruments from the theories of the predecessors. And in 1901, the completion of the radio crossing the Atlantic Ocean shocked and attracted the attention of the world, and they studied and improved it together. Therefore, radio has become increasingly advanced, with long range and convenient use. In addition to commercial use, it can also transmit military information and protect the safety of navigation and aviation. Transforming the electric century of the 20th century into a radio century, Marconi's great name has almost spread to women and children all over the world.</p>
<p>Marconi's first experimental radio was very rudimentary. The oscillator of the transmitter was made of two copper balls, one connected to an aluminum wire tied to a kite line in the sky as an antenna, and the other connected to a copper wire connected to the ground as a ground wire. The detector of the receiver uses a coherer with metal filings gathered in a glass tube to start broadcasting. The distance gradually increased from half a mile, one mile, nine miles, to twelve miles. But he still buried himself in research, gradually improving, never relaxing his enterprising spirit because of his great success. He used his knowledge and believed in his potential ability to serve the radio industry throughout his life, which is enough to make people admire him!</p>
<p>When Marconi was experimenting with radio, he was in financial straits. His own government did not provide assistance, which almost made him disappointed. However, he had the spirit of perseverance and the perseverance to become more courageous as he was frustrated, and finally succeeded. "Only great people in the world can overcome the environment." Marconi's success can really be a mirror for our country's scientific researchers.</p>
<p>China, where the radio industry is backward, has gradually sprouted and developed in recent years due to the government's advocacy. We hope that the inventor Mr. Marconi's visit here can guide us. If he can give one or two public speeches, so that our people can share the demeanor of the inventor, raise the interest in radio research, and promote the progress of China's radio industry, this is our sincere hope in the enthusiastic welcome to Mr. Ma's visit to China.</p>

<h3>The World's Inventor, Wireless Giant Marconi</h3>
<p>— Lou</p>
<p>Marconi (Guglielmo), the inventor of wireless telegraphy, was born in Bologna, Italy, on April 25, 1874. His father was an Italian gentleman who married Miss Annie Jameson in 1864. They had two sons, with Marconi being the younger.</p>
<p>During his childhood, Marconi loved studying physics and electricity. In 1895, he began to focus on telegraphy, aiming to transmit telegraph signals using radio waves. In the early summer of that year, he conducted numerous experiments at home. Although the equipment used in these experiments was rudimentary, he achieved a result: communication over a distance of more than one mile could be achieved using radio waves.</p>
<p>His initial success involved using elevated transmitting and receiving antennas, connected to the ground via a generator and detector. He invented a method to enhance current strength by connecting a spark gap to a metal plane buried in the ground using a loop of wire. His receiver used a sensitive detector called a Coherer, connected between the ground and the elevated transmitter. This setup allowed him to receive signals from other stations. Simultaneously, he discovered that the higher the antenna, the greater the communication distance.</p>
<p>The following year, Marconi went to England and continued his research in London. He demonstrated the results of his research to British postal officials and representatives from other government agencies. These demonstrations initially took place on the roof of the London General Post Office. Subsequently, the experimental area expanded, allowing communication over distances of nine miles.</p>
<p>In June 1897, Marconi was invited by the Italian government to Spezia, where a wireless station had been established. He used radio waves to communicate with Italian warships 12 miles away. Later, he was invited to perform in Rome. In the presence of the former Italian King and Queen, he achieved further success in his experiments.</p>
<p>At that time, everyone wanted to apply wireless technology to commercial use. In July 1897, a company was established in London, granted a license by Marconi to develop the technology in countries other than Italy. Initially, the company was called Wireless Telegraph Signal Co., Ltd. In 1900, it was renamed Marconi's Wireless Telegraph Co., Ltd. The company's efforts and the advancement of wireless technology were interdependent.</p>
<p>Wireless technology was first used commercially in 1898. In that year, Marconi was invited by the British to establish wireless engineering to enable Queen Victoria and Edward VII to communicate. In the same year, wireless technology was also used for communication between ships and land, but the distance between ships and land was limited to 12 miles.</p>
<p>During this period, Marconi continued his research and improvements tirelessly, leading to continuous progress in wireless technology. By 1900, he could communicate over a distance of 200 miles. In 1901, there was even more remarkable progress. On December 12 of that year, Marconi's initial experiment—transmitting messages across the Atlantic using wireless technology—was successful. Subsequently, he repeatedly tested with considerable success, confirming that wireless technology could be used as a communication tool over any distance.</p>
<p>In 1902, during a trip to the Americas, Marconi received signals from 700 miles away during the day and 2,000 miles away at night. This discovery revealed that the communication range of wireless technology was greater at night than during the day.</p>
<p>Marconi was not satisfied with these discoveries and continued to research and improve. In 1910, with the help of H. J. Round, he was able to communicate over 6,000 miles using wireless technology. In 1912, he invented a new communication method commonly known as The Timed Spark System. By 1918, he used this method to communicate between England and Australia.</p>
<p>During World War I, wireless technology was firmly established for military communications. It was at this time that Marconi recognized that there were still inconveniences in the application of radio waves. He then devoted himself to researching improvement methods, which laid the foundation for the invention of shortwave radio.</p>
<p>In 1916, with the help of Franklin, he devoted himself to research. By 1924, he discovered that shortwaves of 30 meters could also be used for communication over any distance during the day. In recent years, he has further studied ultra-short waves—radio waves almost the same wavelength as light—and has achieved considerable success.</p>
<p>Marconi's contributions to science are significant, and scholars worldwide know his name. He not only devoted himself to scientific research but also participated in political activities. During the European War, he served in the Italian army and was appointed by the Italian King as a representative to the Paris Peace Conference. In 1930, he became a member of the Fascist Party. He is currently traveling around the world and arrived in Shanghai on the 7th of this month.</p>
<h3>Marconi's Early Inventions and Contributions to the Wireless Field</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiancun</p>
<p>The contributions of America's Edison to the scientific world have spread his reputation globally, and everyone knows his greatness. However, the great contributions of Italy's Marconi to the wireless field are known to fewer people than those who know Edison. It must be understood that Marconi's greatness is no less than Edison's. Taking advantage of Marconi's visit, I will briefly introduce his contributions to the wireless field.</p>
<p>Before Marconi became famous, the theory of wireless telegraphy already had a considerable foundation. As early as 1865, the great mathematician James Clerk Maxwell published the so-called "electromagnetic theory of light," asserting that oscillating discharges could emit electromagnetic waves into space, with properties similar to light waves. Later, in 1887, Hertz conducted practical experiments to demonstrate the existence of electromagnetic waves, proving the "electromagnetic theory of light" to be correct. This discovery inspired Marconi's invention of wireless telegraphy. Marconi's exploration of wireless telegraphy began at the age of eighteen, and he invented the wireless machine in 1895, which is quite memorable in the history of wireless telegraphy. Although the wireless machine invented by Marconi at that time seems extremely primitive by today's standards, it was a sensational treasure at the time. Its structure is shown in the following diagram. That is, as shown in diagram (A), one end of the Hertz oscillator is buried underground, and the other end is suspended in the air. The former is commonly known as grounding, and the latter is called an antenna. There is a spark gap G between the antenna and the ground. If a high voltage is supplied to the self-induction coil I, a spark discharge occurs. Thus, an oscillation occurs in the antenna-to-ground circuit (commonly known as damped oscillation), which serves as a transmitting device. To transmit telegraphic symbols, a telegraph key K must be inserted into the primary circuit of the self-induction coil. When the telegraph key is pressed, current flows from the battery B, causing the self-induction coil to operate. At this time, because the telegraph key's switch is not constant, the direct current flowing in the primary coil is intermittently unstable, resulting in high voltage in the secondary coil, causing spark discharge at G, and oscillation in the antenna circuit, ultimately emitting radio waves into space through the antenna. The antenna initially used by Marconi, such as the</p>
<p>Marconi and his wife communicate with the United States on a ship in the Mediterranean using the latest shortwave radio.</p>
<p>When a 30-cubic-foot galvanized iron can was suspended at a height of 21 meters, it could achieve communication over a distance of 30 meters. When the galvanized iron can was suspended at a height of 42 meters, it could achieve communication over a distance of 90 meters. And if the height of the galvanized iron can was further increased, it could achieve communication over a distance of 2,400 meters, it is said. Marconi also used an antenna A and a ground E in his receiving device (as shown in diagram B), inserting a coherer C between the two. Both ends of C are connected to a choke coil CC, a battery B, and a relay R. A battery B2 and a Morse ink recorder are inserted into the relay circuit. Normally, current cannot flow in the Br, CC, C, R circuit because the resistance of the coherer is too great. However, if a radio wave touches the antenna, an oscillating current passes through the antenna circuit. Therefore, the resistance of the coherer must be reduced, so current passes through the B, CC, CR circuit, causing the relay to operate. Once the relay operates, the B2M circuit is closed, and current can flow, ultimately displaying the received signal on the Morse ink recorder. This is an outline of the wireless machine initially invented by Marconi. At that time, it could only receive ten to fifteen characters per minute. The year after the machine was invented, Marconi took it to England. With the assistance of Preece, the Chief Engineer of the General Post Office at the time, he gradually improved the device, and in 1898, he successfully achieved communication over a distance of eighteen kilometers. However, Marconi's ambition did not stop there. He finally completed his long-distance communication of two thousand miles across the Atlantic in 1901. His contribution to the wireless field is so great that Marconi's reputation can be passed down for thousands of years.</p>
<h3>Marconi and Ultra-Short Waves</h3>
<p>— Ming Xiang</p>
<p>Although the invention of ultra-short wave radio communication has only a history of three or four years, general radio engineers and amateur researchers flock to it, unanimously believing that the most interesting and promising experiment is sufficient to create a new era in the history of radio. The most successful experimenter is Mr. Marconi, the originator of radio.</p>
<p>The scope of ultra-short waves generally refers to radio waves above 30000 K·C·. Their properties are almost similar to those of light waves, and their characteristics have many significant differences from ordinary short waves. During the current experimental period, long-distance communication cannot be achieved, but Marconi's achievements are already astonishing.</p>
<p>In 1901, when Marconi completed his transatlantic shortwave communication, the transmitting and receiving distance reached more than 3,000 miles. However, at that time, scientists had previously used precise and profound mathematical formulas to prove that the maximum communication distance could not exceed 160 miles. Marconi broke this theoretical limit, so he once said, "No matter what, regardless of whether it is possible or not, it must be tested." Recently, Marconi's experiment with ultra-short waves is not the same as the situation at that time. With his perseverance, he has achieved today's success.</p>
<p>Marconi's greatest motivation for experimenting with ultra-short waves was that during the European War, radio was widely used in the military. However, military communication values secrecy above all else, and radio transmissions are unrestricted, which prompted Marconi to pay attention to the direction of radio transmissions. He discovered that directivity is the only feature of ultra-short waves. During the period of 1919-24, Marconi experimented with radio waves of ten meters to six meters, and the effect was remarkable.</p>
<p>Marconi said, "The directional characteristics of ultra-short waves are the most valuable and extremely sensitive. As for the transmitting and receiving machinery and equipment, it is even simpler, requiring no powerful power supply equipment, and is not affected by clouds and fog, or the interference of atmospheric electricity."</p>
<p>On December 2, 1932, Marconi announced at the Royal Institute the success of his ultra-short wave radio communication experiment, because he had just completed communication between Roccadi Papa near Rome and Cape Figari Sardinia, with a distance of 168 miles (more than one hundred miles beyond the theoretical limit at this time). He is also confident in achieving even more distant communications. The wavelength of communication has created a new record of 22 inches (less than one meter). This fact, which was considered impossible in the theory at the time, Marconi was able to achieve.</p>
<p>Marconi also applied ultra-short waves to broadcast radio, building an ultra-short wave broadcast transmitter with a wavelength of 7.75 meters at the London headquarters of the British Broadcasting Corporation (B·B·C·). It is currently being experimented with by Marconi company engineers and the broadcasting company.</p>
<p>Marconi firmly believes that ultra-short waves can also be used for radio image transmission (Television), with a wavelength range of approximately between two meters and four meters.</p>
<p>He also said, "This kind of ultra-short wave can now be turned into light signals for long-distance communication, such as between signal stations along the coast, or between castles on the frontier."</p>
<p>Recently, on August 8, ultra-short wave radio telephones, invented by Marconi, have been tested between Santa Marguerite Ligura and Roccadi Papa in Italy. The machinery is extremely convenient, can be placed in a pocket, and carried around, eliminating the complicated wiring of current telephones. The test results have reached one hundred miles, and are extremely clear. In the future, after successful popularization, please enjoy it!</p>
<h3>From Marconi's Visit to China to Chinese Radio Experts</h3>
<p>— Wei Yan</p>
<p>Italian radio inventor Marchese Guglielmo Marconi traveled to various countries and came to Beijing from Beiping on the 6th of this month, taking the night train to Shanghai that evening. Information about Marconi's itinerary and life experiences has been successively scattered in various newspapers and magazines, and this article will not repeat them. Now, I would like to briefly state one or two of my personal feelings about Marconi's visit to China:</p>
<p>In China, although there are no accurate statistics on the number of people engaged in radio research, judging from the brisk sales of various radio materials imported over the years, it can be seen that the number is not small. However, since there are so many people researching, why is it that we rarely hear about any new inventions or new contributions to radio science from them? Of course, natural and man-made disasters, internal and external troubles over the years are enough to hinder the development of all undertakings, but I think the biggest reason is that a generation of people researching radio have not recognized the path they should take and the efforts they should make.</p>
<p>We know that the progress of radio in the last ten years has almost entirely benefited from a generation of amateur radio operators.</p>
<p>Gifts Presented by This Museum to Lord Marconi</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>There are also many amateur operators in various parts of China (it is said that there are as many as 300,000 people in Shanghai alone who have installed radios. Assuming that one percent of them are amateur operators rather than pure hedonists, then the number is already 3,000). Why is it that they are always silent and unknown? It turns out that the majority of amateur operators in China are acting without knowledge. The experimental work they engage in on a daily basis is only done rigidly according to the template. Success is their fluke, but failure is inexplicable. Those who are willing to browse various newspapers and magazines at any time are already rare. As for those who research and have any insights, that is even more rare. Researching science in this way, groping in the dark and imitating blindly, only increases a leakage expenditure in vain!</p>
<p>There are also those who specialize in research. For example, among the students who study abroad each time, many specialize in radio. However, because they are only willing to spend effort on books or chalk after returning to China, they almost completely abandon the experimental work that they should do on a daily basis. They usually do not easily step into the laboratory. "Knowing but not acting," the result is the same as that of a generation of amateur operators who "act without knowing."</p>
<p>The success of scientists has never been achieved by "acting without knowing" or "knowing but not acting." In the past, such as the quirky inventor Edison, when he was a newsboy, he read almost every book related to electricity. After adulthood until his death, he spent almost every day in the laboratory. Others such as Newton, Darwin, Thomson, and Einstein, which one of them could complete their careers by relying solely on a few textbooks or random experiments? Therefore, I think that to make inventions in science, one must attach equal importance to theory and experiment—in other words, one must "know and act together" to achieve the goal.</p>
<p>Because of a momentary feeling, I have unknowingly said so much nonsense. I hope that after this visit to China by Marconi, the comrades in the country who are researching radio—amateur and non-amateur—will learn from the reasons why foreign scientists have been able to succeed, learn from the past, recognize their goals, and work hard simultaneously on both hands and minds. Only in this way can we avoid falling behind, achieve something, and not live up to the great inventor's kind intention to come to China. Finally, I respectfully wish Mr. Marconi, who seeks welfare for the people, a safe journey!</p>
<h3>Marconi Wireless Machine Factory in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Qing Yun</p>
<p>"Marconi-China," what a great name! There is no limit to Marconi's inventions, and no one can imagine what the future of China will be like. Wireless telegraphy is like a young hero, and China seems to be a lion about to awaken. In the world's attention, the organization of the "China Marconi" factory, or the China Wireless Telegraph Company, has important significance.</p>
<p>During the European War, our country felt the importance of wireless communication because of our participation in the war. Therefore, we cooperated with the London Marconi Wireless Company to operate various wireless communication enterprises in China. We established a manufacturing plant, and in recent years, the development of wireless communication in our country has been greatly supported by this plant.</p>
<p>Marconi Wireless Machine Factory tests shipborne transmitters.</p>
<p>The factory is located at 759 Taopeng Road in Shanghai. The various components used on land, sea, and air are carefully reviewed. All other components used for transmitting, receiving, and amplification undergo a test of 10,000 volts before being used. Wood and steel models are stored in specific plans. The thick and thin cables are carefully constructed to prevent interference caused by power fluctuations. The factory base covers an area of ten acres, all of which are owned. If future expansion is needed, it will be easy to do. The showroom is located at No. 2 Beijing Road, and experts are hired to serve all sectors of society, providing simple receiver manufacturing, large transmitter installation, and mainland communication.</p>
<p>The "Marconi Alarm Station" has long been the savior of dangers on routes near Shanghai. Now, the defense against pirates and the crackdown on smuggling along the coast are all controlled by wireless telegraphy. And what is used is Marconi's machinery. The wireless communication equipment for the Shanghai Public Concession Police is also entirely Marconi's equipment. Recently, the government has also contacted the London Marconi Wireless Company to send and receive British and American telegrams, which will further facilitate communication between the East and the West.</p>
<p>The Far East has a vast land area that needs to be connected by wireless telegraphy. There is no need to say more. If the factory, jointly established by China and Britain, can strengthen its expansion based on its existing success, then the future development will be unlimited.</p>
<h3>Marconi's Radio Milestones</h3>
<p>— Yi Zhi</p>
<p>1874 April 25, William Marconi was born in Italy.</p>
<p>1895 Studied radio and was confident that he could enable communication between two places in the distant air.</p>
<p>1896 Because the Italian King was unwilling to invest in helping him succeed, he went to England in February of that year. In July, the British London Post Office Administration agreed with his work and provided assistance. Trials of communication between Peralh and Wiston were effective.</p>
<p>1897 Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company was established. 1901 Marconi successfully sent a message from Poldhu, a coastal radio station in Cornwall, to St. John's radio station in Newfoundland, USA.</p>
<p>1902 Established a permanent radio station in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, New England.</p>
<p>1903 Marconi transmitted American news to the London Times.</p>
<p>1906 Invented the Direct System and the Persistent Wave System.</p>
<p>1907 Wireless telegraphy was commercialized.</p>
<p>1910 Invented the Vacuum Tube Receiver (Va;vercoewer) and the Electrolytic Detector (Eectrolytiodetecto r). Also devised a method to enable both transmitting and receiving agencies to transmit and receive reciprocally at extremely high speed, i.e., the Doubling System.</p>
<p>1915 Italy joined the war. Marconi served as the radio affairs director of the Italian government, and received the Grand Cross of the Italian King and honors from the United Kingdom, France, and other countries.</p>
<p>1920-1930 Invented the Marconi directional antenna, wireless remote control lights, and various theories and instruments on ultra-short waves, etc.</p>
<h3>Discovering Atmospheric Electricity Through Radio</h3>
<p>— Lei Wei</p>
<p>Karl Jansky, a well-known radio expert in Holmdel, New Jersey, in the eastern United States, recently discovered a strange phenomenon in the reception of radio receivers. After a year of research, he has proven that the sounds received by these radios are atmospheric electricity generated in the Milky Way in the universe. This discovery is considered to be the most peculiar and noteworthy event in the radio community recently.</p>
<p>Karl Jansky used a powerful radio, and installed an antenna, with the antenna at a right angle to the center of the universe, pointing away from the Earth. When he pointed the top end of this antenna southward, he heard a clear babbling sound in the radio, like running water in a valley. This sound seemed to have a certain regularity, and was not disturbed by other noises, which aroused Karl's curiosity and led him to research it.</p>
<p>He switched from a longwave radio to a medium-wave and shortwave radio. Each time he switched to a different radio, he was able to discover many sounds. As a result of the research, he determined that these sounds were atmospheric electricity in the sky. He then continued to research and determined that the wavelength of these electrical waves was 14.6 meters long when they were at their strongest, and that these electrical waves came from the south of the Earth, determined to be emitted from the Milky Way in the sky, and had strong magnetic induction. Although this is speculation, many electrical experts have jointly researched and determined that it is a kind of electricity attacking the Earth from the sky. This electricity is the Poworlioe in radio science.</p>
<p>The power of this atmospheric electricity is extremely powerful. The distance between the power source and the Earth is 4,000 light-years (Lightyear is the distance traveled by light in one year). In the sky, if you use a sound telescope to look at the source of the atmospheric electricity, there are many gray sands and gases covering it, so you can't see it very clearly. You can only see a thin layer of white light, in which there are millions of stars. Because there is a hub of attraction between the stars, this hub of attraction succeeds in creating a kind of mutual induction force, just like millions of large coils, mutually inducing and generating a kind of powerful atmospheric electricity, which is the electrical wave that Karl is now receiving in the radio.</p>
<p>After a year of continuous research, it was discovered that the center of this atmospheric electricity is too huge to be easily changed. Although the Earth revolves around the Sun and has a circumference of 600,000,000 miles, the direction of the electrical waves does not change. From this, it can be seen the immensity and general influence of this atmospheric electricity.</p>
<p>As for many other questions, such as what kind of changes the power of atmospheric electricity can cause on the Earth, are still under research. What is now known is that this atmospheric electricity fills the universe, causing the air molecules on the Earth to become ions, and the so-called aether (Aether) is born from this, which is another important speculation in radio.</p>
<h3>Internal and External News</h3>
<p>Pocket-Sized Wireless Radio Appears: This pocket-sized wireless radio is manufactured by the Ann Arbor International Radio Cooperation U.S.A. of Michigan, USA. The entire machine weighs only two pounds and measures 6" x 4 1/2".</p>
<p>It is about the size of a folding mirror case like a postcard. The machine contains two vacuum tubes. According to the company, these tubes are as effective as five ordinary tubes. The power source can be supplied by DC or AC. There is also a small three-inch speaker inside the machine.</p>
<p>The circuit of the machine was designed by Robert Wuerfel. It is said that the broadcast signal can be amplified three times after passing through the first tube, which is sufficient</p>
<p>for amplification. The second tube acts as both a power output and rectifier. The volume is adjusted by moving a slider. To select listening signals and music, a happy-shaped dial can be rotated. The tuning capacitor is made of two tin sheets, so that the angle of opening and closing changes to increase or decrease its capacity.</p>
<p>— One Who Knows</p>
<p>Loudspeaker that Helps to Kill: Radio can help culture to rise, and at the same time it can help to kill. On a large scale, radio is used to control unmanned airplanes, tanks, warships, mines, etc., to carry out killing tactics on the battlefield. All countries are competing to do their best in inventing these terrible killing radios. In the near future great war, we will surely witness them.</p>
<p>As for loudspeakers, they can emit beautiful music for people to entertain themselves. That they can help to kill is something no one dares to believe, but this is indeed the news. The murder happened in France. According to the murderer's confession: When he was about to harm the deceased, he was afraid that the matter would be leaked and hinder the killing. Because there was a radio loudspeaker in the room, he used the loudspeaker to receive broadcast music. In the performance of beautiful music, in the loud noise, he killed the deceased, so at that time, he shielded the ears and eyes of people outside the room and it was not leaked out.</p>
<p>— Jiancun</p>
<p>Terrifying Atmospheric Electricity: The most difficult problem to solve in radio is the interference of atmospheric electricity (Note: Ultra-short waves are not affected by the interference of atmospheric electricity, so of course it is not a problem). The magnitude of the interference is enough to hinder radio broadcasts. According to the recent announcement by Whites of the American Telegraph and Telephone Company's survey technicians, "The voltage of large atmospheric electricity is 100,000 volts, and its current is 200,000 amperes. If it is converted into power, it will be 20 billion watts, that is, 20 million kilowatts." The great power of atmospheric electricity is conceivable.</p>
<p>— Jiancun</p>
<p>The Feige Company, located at 96 Nanjing Road in this city, has now received a large shipment of the latest 1934 five-tube radios from the American factory. The clarity and loudness of the sound are the most reliable among all brands of five-tube machines. It is said that the selling price is 165 yuan per set.</p>

<h3>Financial and Gold Markets Were Dull All Day: Market Conditions Were Desolate and the Future Was Even Worse; Daily Variation Was Only 2.4 Yuan</h3>
<p>The gold market was quite calm yesterday. The fluctuations throughout the day were extremely narrow, and trading in the market was sparse. The future market was even worse. In the early morning, overseas calls came in, with the Bank of England slightly rising and the Bank of America showing no movement. The forward silver price on the Gold and Silver Exchange only shrunk by 5 hao to 2.2 li, etc. Exchange rate fluctuations were mixed. London raw gold shrunk by 11 pence. The U.S. official purchase price for newly mined gold remained unchanged, still calculated at $34.01. U.S. cotton rose slightly, as did U.S. wheat. Stock prices mostly rose and few fell. The raw market opened and retreated to around 700 yuan. After that, there was not much fluctuation, and the fluctuations were limited. After opening, the infield was slightly tight. The exchange rate of the U.S. dollar quoted by HSBC Bank shrank by 0.125 and rose, but people's hearts were uncertain, and so was the appetite of the banks. Rumors deteriorated, and after that it once retreated to 700 yuan. The final trading was not prosperous, the exchange market was flat, and the situation in the market was clear and there was not much change. Although there were many suppliers in the future market, the prediction of swap trading was ultimately favorable. Efforts were made to pull the price, and the infield was extremely flat, so the market situation was desolate. It was found that there was only a 2.4 jiao difference throughout the day, and the market situation was very mediocre. Before the morning opening, Reuters reported that French Finance Minister Bonnet claimed that the government would never abandon the gold standard and that the franc would be protected, but because Jones, the director of the U.S. Financial Rehabilitation Agency, reported the amount of gold he had purchased and indicated that overseas gold purchases seemed to have been neglected, the gold market was not affected. The raw price was 1,075 yuan. The market situation for the day is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 700 yuan and 5 jiao, a decrease of 2.7 jiao compared to the previous close. Goods opened at the same price. The exchange market opened with the near-term selling price of the British exchange rate at 1 shilling, 3 pence, 625, and the U.S. exchange rate at 33 yuan and 625. Qianchang, Xiangheng, Yu, Gulijin, and others made deals, and Huabi pulled the March U.S. dollar at 625, and Zhengjin pulled the April at 875. Therefore, the initial market was relatively stable, fluctuating from 0.2 jiao. It was not until the HSBC Bank's listing of the British exchange rate at par and the U.S. shrinking by 0.125 that the gold market rose. Although trading in the market was sparse, Hengyu, Yuanmao, Yongfu, Yu, and others levied. Zhengjin again pulled the January U.S. dollar at 9375 and the April at 8125, and it rose to 2.4 jiao. Yuanmao and Yonghengyu divested, and then the downstream market took shape. Then, because the April U.S. dollar at 8125 was difficult to sell, rumors were unfavorable. Wanxing and Huixiang also sold, and it fell to 700 yuan. Zhengjin again pulled the March U.S. dollar at 625, Yuanmao, Yongzhifeng, and Yong took the opportunity to levy. Taiwan Zhengjin pulled the April U.S. dollar at 875, and it rose to 1.4 jiao. Hengyu and the Dalian gang still came to divest, and it dropped to 0.1 jiao. After that, the situation fluctuated, trading in the market was not much, and the fluctuations were uncertain. People's hearts were dazed. The afternoon closing was 701 yuan, and the goods were auctioned at 0.7 jiao. After the closing, it was initially stable and then tired.</p>
<p>The after-market opening was 700 yuan and 7 jiao, and the goods closed at the same price. The exchange market was flat. The start was quite desolate. Huixiang sold and retreated to 0.2 jiao. Fuchang, Hengyu, Yuansheng, Yongyuan, Hengzhaofeng, Chang, and others all entered. Zhengjin pulled the April U.S. dollar at 8125, and it rose to 2.3 jiao. Goods were divested, and Huixiang sold again, and it rose to 1 yuan. Daxingyong slightly levied at a limited price, and it was still able to recover well. Mitsui blocked the April U.S. dollar at 8125. Under the limited sales of Hengtai and Yuanmaoyong, it still formed a downstream market. Zhengchang sold again, and it dropped to 0.9 jiao. Mitsui levied the March U.S. dollar at 5625, and Yuanheng levied and rose to 1.7 jiao. Trading in the market was extremely sparse, and the fluctuations were narrow. The fluctuations were quite fixed. The closing price was 701 yuan and 7 jiao, and the goods were auctioned at 2 yuan. After the closing, Shunli and Yuanmaoyong levied and rose slightly. It was found that the highest price of the day was 702 yuan and 4 jiao, and the lowest price was 700 yuan, with only a 2.4 jiao difference. As a result, it decreased by 1.5 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The announced price was 719 yuan due to the HSBC Bank's U.S. dollar listing shrinking by 0.125 to 33 yuan and 375, and the standard gold price. According to the closing price, it was about 17 yuan, which was 4 yuan more than the previous close. The registered price for this month was 707 yuan, and for January it was 701 yuan. The morning water replenishment was 707 yuan, and the afternoon water replenishment was 708 yuan. The raw price retreated to 1,075 yuan, due to the fall in London raw gold. Trading in the market was slack. Initially, Yingfeng Heng sold 300 taels to the Tianjin gang for 1,072 yuan. Later, the Tianjin gang sold it to Yingfeng Heng at the same price. The after-market was quiet and there was no movement. There were still 4,438 tickets left for this month.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was slack, and there was a lack of wholesale deposits and withdrawals. In summary, Huixiang, Hengtai, Yuanmaoxiang, Hefutai, Hengtongchun, etc. were on the selling side, and Yuanmaoyong, Hengchangyong, Dadecheng, Fuyu, Yifengyong, Yuanyongfeng, Yongzhengchang, Fuchang, Yuanheng, etc. were on the buying side. Wanxing and Yuanchun Yuanheng first came out and then entered, and Zhifeng Yonghengyu first entered and then came out. The Dalian Gang and Shunli jointly did more than 1,100 tickets, and the offset was slightly out. Wanxing jointly did more than 900 tickets, and the offset was flat. The Guangdong Gang Hengxing had extremely little movement in and out, and the offset was slightly bought. The after-market was even quieter. The total number of chips for January was 34,517.</p>
<h3>No Special Changes in Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's foreign telegrams, the London big stripe rose by nearly 0.0625, the forward did not move, the Bank of America was still flat, the forward silver price fell by 5 hao, the British exchange rate against the U.S. dollar fell by 1 point, the U.S. exchange rate against the British rose by 0.5 points, the British exchange rate against the French grew by 0.12 jiao, the U.S. exchange rate against the French shrunk by 0.02 jiao, London raw gold fell by 11 pence, the private telegram silver price did not move, and the exchange rate grew by 0.5 points.

<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Securities Exchange, initially the rising trend did not stop, and then a sudden reversal occurred, rising and falling sharply, with a flexible market and extremely rapid changes. Rumors rose again in the market, mostly saying that the Southwest's claims were quite strong, and the path to peace was looming. The affairs in Fujian were difficult to resolve, and war was ultimately unavoidable. In addition, the market price had risen for six consecutive days, and had recovered by as much as 89 yuan compared to the lowest price. The number of accounts at the exchange had decreased from more than 70 million to several million. Most of the long and short parties had settled, and half of them had left. The front line was gradually shortening, and if there were no changes in the affairs in Fujian, it would likely fluctuate for a while. When the market opened yesterday morning, the market continued the rising trend of the previous day, and the remaining power was still strong. The North Gang's replenishment was still very active, but the number of entries on the 4th had slightly decreased, while the number of entries by retail investors was not weak.

<h3>Under Massive Purchases, the Biao Yarn Rising Trend Was Particularly Strong</h3>
<p>The yarn market is trending upward, and the rising trend is also rapid. After continuous sharp declines, it has aroused profit-takers to replenish their positions. This situation was also expected. At the same time, there are rumors of speculators organizing a long company. No. 34 Ruiquan, No. 39 Senkang, No. 38 Yuanda, and Sanhu purchased more than 10,000 bales in the previous market. With the lack of chips, such a large number of purchases naturally caused the market to rise sharply. However, actual demand is still weak.</p>
<h3>Near-Month Yarn Rose Sharply by 3 Yuan</h3>
<p>When the Renbiao market opened in the previous market, large households purchased aggressively regardless of price limits, and the market rose sharply. Each month rose by 2.34 yuan to 1.4 yuan.

<h3>Biao Cotton Was Supported High by Yarn</h3>
<p>The cotton market turned upward, supported by the rise in the yarn market. However, the current demand from cotton mills is quite stagnant. All mills have no intention of entering the market, and Indian cotton is also being made available for 1,500 pieces at cheaper prices. According to some news, Zhengzhou, Shaanxi, and other places have been affected by finance, and a large number of existing goods are said to be coming to Shanghai. Therefore, there are still many sellers when the market rises.</p>

The Bombay cotton market fell due to long positions settling, resulting in a flat fall of 1 rupee, 2.5 corners in Gahl, and a fall of 7.5 corners in Omra and White Rocks. The original telegram is recorded on the left (7th telegram):</p>

<h3>Grain Market, Existing Foreign Wheat Was Constantly Peddling, and Both Period Flour and Wheat Declined</h3>
<p>After the flour market opened in the morning, the market in each month showed a phenomenon of rising first and then falling. Because the price of foreign wheat was quoted, Chicago continued to improve by 0.23 jiao, and Canada improved by about 0.1 jiao. Therefore, after the opening price, the market in each month was slightly brisk by more than 0.01 yuan. However, by the second round, the market suddenly fell again, because the peddling of existing foreign wheat was endless. In addition, due to the exchange rate, the asking price was unusually cheap. It was heard that a certain factory in this port also transacted a ship of Argentine wheat, with a cheap price of 3.95 yuan, and American white wheat was also cheap at 4.05 yuan, resulting in a sharp decline in March, April, and May. In particular, April and May were even worse, falling by as much as 0.45 yuan compared to the initial opening. Forced to open the market in the afternoon, although the trend in each month was still not good, it was still peaceful. Recently, because the Tianjin quotation is still weak, small factories have slightly issued in the far-term, and the market situation is unbearable. The dumping of ticket foreign wheat is unavoidable in the distant future. As a result, this month fell by 0.0275 yuan compared to the previous day, January and February fell by 0.0275 yuan, March fell by 0.0325 yuan, April fell by 0.035 yuan, and May fell by 0.0375 yuan.</p>
<p>After the wheat market opened in the morning and afternoon, the market in each month generally showed a flat and sluggish state. When it first opened in the morning, the market was still stable because the price of foreign wheat rebounded by 0.13 yuan and about 0.1 jiao. Afterwards, because the flour market turned soft and the peddling of foreign wheat was endless, people's hearts unanimously looked soft again. Although the trading in each month was not very smooth, the price fell by 0.035 yuan. Until the afternoon market opened, the trend was still average, but in the midst of fluctuations, it showed a slight stability, because the hedging of foreign wheat was less likely to occur. As a result, this month was less than 0.01 yuan compared to the previous day, January was less than 0.03 yuan, February was less than 0.04 yuan, March was less than 0.02 yuan, and the rest remained unchanged. The current wheat market is still stable and brisk, with Shandong wheat opening at 4.437 yuan, Yaowan wheat at 4.43 yuan, Yangzhou wheat at 4.2 yuan, Dongtai wheat at 4.2 yuan, Tongzhou wheat at 4.17 yuan, Wuhe wheat at 4.15 yuan, and Anding wheat at 4.02 yuan. Huafeng went to 2,000 bales, and Xinda went to 500 bales.</p>
<h3>Tax Rates on Foreign Rice Flour and Wheat</h3>
<p>Regarding the taxation of foreign flour, wheat, and rice, it was rumored yesterday from reliable sources that flour would be taxed at 1 yuan in national currency, wheat at 0.5 jiao, and rice at 2 yuan, etc.</p>
<h3>Rain Dampens City, Rice Prices Soften Slightly</h3>
<p>(Southern Shanghai) Due to the rain, only slightly more than thirty boats arrived (four to five thousand piculs). Consequently, merchants were scarce, and the market was quieter than yesterday, showing a tendency to soften. Although various types of late rice were selling, the volume of arriving goods was small, keeping the market tight. However, buyers, seeing the sluggish market, were very demanding, causing disagreement between buyers and sellers, resulting in a stalemate. Eventually, only three loads of Songjiang rice, one load of Tailaimiao rice, and one load of Qingjiao rice, totaling about six hundred bags, were sold in the afternoon. However, prices had already fallen considerably. Common, Sutong, and Gangnan thick japonica rice also saw price drops of several cents due to limited demand, while Du Yang pointed rice fortunately remained stable due to scarcity, with no change in price.</p>
<p>(Northern Shanghai) Yesterday, over forty shipments arrived from various waterways south of the river. This morning, the market was sluggish due to rain, and sales were poor. White japonica rice prices fell slightly. Yang Du Bu Xian white rice prices were weak, down several cents. Thin rice prices rose slightly. Yin Yuan Ke Xian rice prices were flat to weak.</p>
<h3>Ke Xian Rice Prices Rise Slightly, Local Merchants Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Ke Xian rice market saw increased interest from Japanese merchants in the Bund area, boosting confidence. Continued interest from merchants on the Bund also stimulated business among Ke rice dealers, who found local demand in Fujian province to be very high. However, this demand had been suppressed since the incident, and transportation had been difficult, preventing them from fulfilling their orders. In recent days, however, commercial activity has returned to normal, and Fuzhou dealers have gradually become more active. After the Bund merchants had actively traded, Fuzhou merchants also became active again, and Quanzhou merchants also began to resume trade, driving the market to continue to rise, increasing prices by five cents to one dime compared to the previous day. The Bund merchants purchased 1,000 bags of Hunan machine-milled oil rice at $7.10 per bag, 300 bags of machine-milled late rice at $7.58 per bag, 500 bags of Wuxi machine-milled Yuan rice at $8.40 to $8.00 per bag, and Ningbo merchants purchased 300 bags of Wuhu machine-milled Yuan rice at $7.67 to $7.40 per bag. Fuzhou merchants purchased 326 bags of Hunan rough oil rice at $6.10 per bag, 177 bags of rough Jing rice at $5.80 per bag, and 173 bags of rough red rice at $5.74 per bag. The Bund merchants, in partnership with Quanzhou merchants, purchased 285 bags of machine-milled Jing rice at $7.20 per bag, and subsequent transactions at $6.60 per bag.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Vegetable Oil Remains Weak</h3>
<p>The soybean oil market has been demoralized by continuous sharp declines in telegraphic transfers. Yesterday, 500 cases of Dalian oil arrived by steamship at $12.10 per case, a further decline of 50 cents compared to the previous day, and the outlook remains pessimistic. Due to congested supplies, peanut oil sellers were forced to lower prices to stimulate demand. Yesterday, 2,000 cases of light-skinned peanut oil were sold at $10.05 per case, and 100 cases of Bol oil were sold at $11.60 per case.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: New Chao Qing Arrivals Scarce, Prices Rise Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw flat to weak trading. The Public Association's benchmark for #24 coarse granulated white common sugar was $19.80, with no transactions. Re-export bills of lading were at $6.96, down two cents. #20 medium granulated white sugar was not transacted, at about $19.60. #8/9 Dutch red common sugar was at $15.65, slightly higher by seven to seven and a half cents. Taikoo Sugar B mark was at $20.10, CW mark at $19.95. Zhen Ji #1 fine cotton sugar rose five cents to $18.80, #2 at six cents, #3 at four cents, and #4 at two cents. Only slightly more than 300 pieces of new Chao Qing sugar arrived this time. Due to existing shortages, prices rose slightly. Yesterday, all were cleared, with delivery orders at $15.30, Semi-Southern Qing at $14.70, Gaolonggang Qing at $14.60, and Shimen flake Qing sellers again unloaded several hundred pieces at $10.00, showing a slight rebound.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Xiamen Kumquat Candy Sales Sluggish, Prices Fall</h3>
<p>There have been no recent arrivals of Xiamen kumquat candy. The existing stock is also not large. However, the quality is not very soft and ripe, although the color is good. Aside from some minor retail sales, there were no wholesale transactions, resulting in a sluggish market. Yesterday, whispered deals were heard to have occurred slightly lower than the previous levels, by about two dollars, it was said.</p>
<h3>Metals: East White Iron Prices Fall Across the Board</h3>
<p>Since the enthusiastic arrival of East White Iron, the market has been flooded with stock. Customers in Ningbo and other ports are afraid to load goods due to serious investigations by anti-Japanese associations, and merchants along the Yangtze River route are also not trading. Market transactions are extremely few. Some profit-blinded businesses are panicked by the slow sales, causing prices to fall across the board. For example, 7-foot-long East White Iron costs $1.21 to $1.22, but the market price is only about $1.15; 6-foot-long East White Iron costs $1.00, but the market price is only about $0.96 to $0.97. Therefore, losses are frequent. Other Eastern goods, such as French iron nails, new lead wire, and cement, are also arriving in Shanghai in succession, so prices are generally trending downward.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Japanese Silk Dumping Intensifies Overseas</h3>
<p>Further Price Declines Reported in London Reeled Silk: This year's silkworm cocoon harvest in Japan was abundant, and Japanese silk production has increased sharply. Japan is actively developing overseas sales channels and exporting to the London market. Japanese silk dumping is intensifying. The asking price for Chinese Zhejiang reeled silk continues to fall. A-grade Xiu Lin Fei Ma brand is only priced at 6 shillings and 10 1/2 pence per pound, equivalent to just over $610 per bale in Chinese currency. B-grade Black Lion brand is only 6 shillings and 1 1/2 pence, equivalent to just over $540 in Chinese currency, a further decline of 1 1/2 pence per pound and about $30 per bale compared to the middle of last week.</p>
<p>Thirty-Five Bales of Long Filature Exported to England: Due to the rising demand from overseas silk factories for spring products, 35 bales of long filature were exported on the British mail steamer, Anli, etc., to Bombay the other day.</p>
<p>Prices for Yellow and White Factory Reeled Silk Remain Stagnant: Shanghai's European, American, and Chinese silk exporters believe that New York and Lyon silk factories only have enough silk in stock to meet demand for two months and that overseas silk prices have already fallen to the lowest possible levels. They are all considering taking the opportunity to stockpile in anticipation of demand from European and American silk merchants. However, the asking price for B-grade white factory reeled silk is still only $560 (American grading at 83% average and $630, French grading at 13/5 grading), still $200 to $300 higher than the cost of silk in various factories. Prices remain stagnant. Currently, only Lianna and others are importing 20 bales of white factory reeled silk and 20 bales of gray reeled silk, and prices remain firm.</p>

<p>Miscellany</p>
<h3>Starting from Swatting Flies</h3>
<p>— Chuan Yizhi</p>
<p>The "fly swatter" made of wire mesh and bamboo strips has become my only weapon of vengeance. It - the fly - tried to find its way out of the glass window. As a result, this way out became its fatal wound. Its body was glued to the glass window by its own blood. They busily rushed towards my books and desk in search of food. As a result, these books and desks also became the execution grounds where they sacrificed for survival. Their counterparts came to mourn for their execution, or, perhaps, they strayed into this execution ground in search of food themselves, and finally, one by one, they became the object of my slaughter, giving the appearance of "corpses lying everywhere, blood flowing into rivers". I felt boundless pleasure; but in an instant, I realised that I was an extremely cruel monarch. Driven by my conscience, I swept them into a pile, wanting to wrap them in paper to make a grand "Jing Guan" [mound of corpses].</p>
<p>However, this is, after all, a hypocritical heart of a "cat crying over a mouse". In ancient times, didn't people use human sacrifices to worship the gods? In the Middle Ages, people were also buried alive with the dead. When King Zhou of Shang was moved by curiosity, he took Bi Gan to dissect him, wanting to see the heart of a sage. Meng De still killed people in his dreams. Recently, it was heard that bandits in a certain place tied the feet of "hostages" to tree stumps near a bamboo forest, pulled down large bamboo shoots nearby, and tied them to the "hostages" necks. Then, they used sharp knives to cut open the skin and flesh between their necks and shoulders, and then let the bamboo shoot bounce back, and the head, along with the trachea, would easily separate from the body; this is the legacy of dismemberment, and there is nothing surprising about it. "Slaughter" seems to be an instinct given to mankind by the creator; "it is a carnal pleasure". Because people's nature is to like "slaughter". Little children catch small animals and insects, and then try to kill them. If Li Kui doesn't kill people for a few days, he will feel a headache (see the old play). Is it really so stupid to feel sorry for flowers and bury them like Lin Daiyu when killing a group of flies that spread germs?</p>
<p>I remember this passage in French novelist Maupassant's "A Madman": "Believe that everyone despises those who are preparing to open 'human slaughterhouses'. In reality, however, people heap glory on them. They often hang shiny medals of honor on their chests. Some people give them bonuses, titles, and medals. They carry weapons and pass through the streets, and gentlemen pay attention to them with envious eyes, because they are the messengers of bloodshed!" (according to the translation of Li Qingyai) Indeed, the more people you kill, the higher your status and honor will be. Official titles, wealth, and medals can arrive unexpectedly. Therefore, the soldiers of various capitalist imperialist countries are eager to prepare for World War II; or, a country that closes its doors and kills each other; anti-war associations and what grand alliances are simply dreams!</p>
<p>I don't have the skills of a cook to kill people by skillfully opening the body. I have to take flies as a form of entertainment for destroying life; I want to be a benevolent beast that doesn't step on insects, but I can only blame the flies for not having the ability to defend themselves and resist, isn't that right?</p>

<h3>Winter Musings</h3>
<p>— Xianxian</p>
<p>Autumn has passed, and winter is coming. Signs for "Winter Bargain Sales" are hung all over the streets and alleys. Soft, warm, and fuzzy things have filled the display windows of department stores. Whole fox furs surround women's necks, and woolen coats wrap around every fashionable man and woman, forming meaty bumps. The weather is indeed cold, and the temperature has dropped to around forty degrees.</p>
<p>In winter, the leaves have all fallen from the trees, and all the little animals have either frozen to death or are hibernating. Even the sunlight shows a pale yellow color. Everything shows a shrinking attitude. But there are exceptions. In the dance halls, everyone is sweating profusely. And the rickshaw pullers, taking large strides, will still be facing the northwest wind, with hot sweat pouring down. Some people say that this is called "spring in winter".</p>
<p>Winter is naturally the heaviest burden season for husbands with fashionable wives. Because it is not easy to provide winter clothes that will keep a wife from feeling cold. Furthermore, in terms of the cost of each winter outfit, it can often be equal to several spring, summer, and autumn outfits. And it is also approaching the end of the year, which is even more difficult to deal with. In addition, you also have to prepare a sum for frostbite ointment to treat the frostbite on the six inches of skin round inside the silk stockings. Therefore, people generally say, "Hot days are easier to get through, winter is hard to endure". It turns out that this is the reason.</p>
<p>But there are also people who love "winter". It is said that snuggling in a "warm quilt" in winter is also a pleasure in life. The reasons are that you are not harassed by bedbugs, and you are not threatened by mosquitoes. The northwest wind outside the window attacks everything, causing all inanimate objects to cry out in agony, but in the warm quilt, it is as warm as spring. If one moment of a spring night is worth a thousand gold, then the estimated value of a warm quilt in winter should be worth no less than ten thousand gold. And it is even more so for those who share the same bed with a pretty face or a sallow face.</p>
<p>The temperature has dropped to around forty degrees. Undoubtedly, "winter" has arrived. Great officials who heat water heaters, drink brandy, embrace concubines, and cover themselves with whole mountain blankets naturally don't care. But vagrants who can't even drink a sip of arsenic wine and don't even have a worn cotton-padded jacket to their name will have to endure this icy and snowy world in the same way. Then, why should we sing the praises of "winter" or curse it?</p>
<p>Don't be happy or worry, let's all prepare for winter. —— "Winter" is just such a short period of time.</p>
<h3>The Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twenty: Auspicious Date Set, Old Woman Smiles Daily; Endless Relief from Sorrow, Old Friends Live Across the Street</p>
<p>Zhao Guizhi leaned against the pillow, her face still bearing traces of tears. When her mother spoke to her, she suddenly smiled, showing her teeth. Jiang was a bit puzzled, was she sad or happy? Why was she lying there half-crying and half-laughing? She sat on a chair opposite the kang, staring at Guizhi's face, lost in thought. Guizhi said: "Why are you staring at me? I don't have an extra piece of flesh on my face today." Jiang said: "Look at you, you cry for a while, laugh for a while, and now you seem to be a little angry. I really can't figure out why." Guizhi said: "Look, a person in good health, with no fever or chills, suddenly feels weak and gets sick. How can I not be upset? But when I think that someone as old as me can't help but get sick, I laugh again." Jiang said: "You can't get sick. The wedding date is coming soon, and Ziqiang will be coming home to get married. I'm busy with everything inside and out, and I can't handle it all alone." Although Guizhi's thinking has become much more modern, she still felt a little embarrassed to talk about her own marriage so loudly. She reached out and pulled out a comic book from under the pillow, opened it with both hands, and looked down at it. Seeing her situation, Jiang, although not saying anything, was eager to know Ziqiang's travel date, so she said: "I don't care about setting a date. But Ziqiang's letters always seem a little apologetic, and he is willing to finish the wedding. He means that if he is stationed at Xifengkou for a long time, he plans to bring his family there. I think the days outside the pass are never as good as my hometown. Besides, that's where the troops are stationed." Guizhi interrupted: "What's the matter with that? People who grew up outside the pass can't live their lives? I want to change places to live and get a taste of something new." Jiang said: "What can we elders say? We'll adapt to the circumstances and can live anywhere."</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>On Marriage</h3>
<p>— Yu Dafu</p>
<p>Some time ago, Mr. Lin Yutang seemed to say that a woman's only career is marriage. Now, a French literary giant came to Shanghai and seemed to say in a conversation with a news reporter who visited him that men should not get married if they want to achieve success.</p>
<p>Washington Irving was a single man, but the article in "The Sketch Book" praising his wife was written so beautifully and lovely. Similarly, Charles Lamb was also a single man, and the article "The Unmarried Man's Complaint" in "Essays of Elia" satirized married men and women and the inevitable consequences of marriage - children - to such an extent.</p>
<p>Is it better to get married or not to get married after all? This question seems to be the same as the question of whether the chicken came first or the egg came first. It is often raised, but it has never been resolved. In general, when you want to rent a house, you should not ask if you have dependents. When you want to become an official, you should not become an official if you have no connections in the court. When you want to write an article, a single person cannot write "My Wife". All of these seem to be good reasons to get married. However, if you want to get married, you must first have money, second, you must have leisure, and third, you must have a job. These five conditions are not easy to achieve. What's more, after marriage, "children demand themselves". In this world of overpopulation, economic panic, educational bankruptcy, and ancient customs, if you are not careful, like what Lamb said, if your sons go to the guillotine, it is really going to ruin the prestige of three generations of ancestors. What other singing and harmony of "Please, official!" "Please, madam!" can be said?</p>
<p>After thinking about it, I always feel that it is not good to get married, and it is not good not to get married. If the doctrine of the mean can be applied to marriage, I would very much like to savor the words of a certain gentleman refuting Mr. Lin again. How about first transforming all compatriots into eunuchs like Wei Zhongxian to try?</p>
<h3>Russian-French Illustration Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Xu Baishi</p>
<p>Because of my consistent love for woodcuts, I took advantage of Sunday afternoon to run to Route Tenant de la Tour to see a small exhibition. The atmosphere of Shanghai's exhibitions has been ruined by "masters" and the like, who blow and beat the drums, making people dizzy and unbearable. Therefore, I am ashamed to say that although I am also an "art apprentice", I don't want to see too many current exhibitions. But today is an exception. The reason for the exception is partly due to my preference for woodcuts, and partly due to my trust in foreigners! On all the achievements of emerging art, I am willing to sincerely bow down, not avoiding the stigma of being a "foreign slave".</p>
<p>The location is the YMCA on Route Tenant de la Tour. After passing a section of "Gentleman's Street" (North Sichuan Road), I turned a corner and arrived at the place. The building is very small and gray, not as arrogant as the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge. Entering the door, I immediately saw a wooden sign with Japanese letters, and I realized that it was originally the Japanese YMCA.</p>
<p>It's two small rooms on the second floor. Forty exhibits. At first, I thought it was a woodcut exhibition, but when I looked at the catalog, I realized that it was a "Russian-French Book Illustration Exhibition". Among them, there are also 18 woodcuts, but they are not single woodcuts, but woodcuts used as book illustrations.</p>
<p>The so-called illustrations are mostly sketches, some printed with simple three or two colors, and others are patterned. Those sketches are good. Speaking of book illustrations, they are always related to the content of the book. Often many illustrations are very interesting in the book, but completely tasteless outside the book. Most Chinese illustrations are like this, even the lively style of Feng Zikai cannot be an exception (this depends on the depth of skill and cultivation, so you can't blame anyone deeply). But many illustrations here are not only very suitable for insertion in books, but also can become paintings independently outside of books. When it comes to woodcuts, the first thing that amazes me is that the school of art is very different from what I have seen before. Most of the woodcuts I usually see are bold and rough, but these are very delicate. Among them, Aleksoev's illustration of Gorky's Mother can be said to be the most exquisite and realistic thing. The contours, volumes, and distances of the characters are truly alive, and each has its own expression. At first glance, it seems that he used a very fine pen to draw the light-receiving parts of each object on black paper - the dark parts are left black!, the strokes are sparse, and the sense of solidity is refreshing. This technique is completely different from that of Masereel and others, one often uses some unrealistic exaggerations to reveal tension, while here it is delicate, real, and strong.</p>
<p>Another set of Fodin's illustrations of City and Year has a similar style to Mother, but the atmosphere is different. In this set, the changing weather is engraved - snow, clouds, storms, etc. The expressiveness is naturally sufficient. Especially the scene of the storm, the kind of air from depression to release is completely revealed. And the appearances of various objects changed by the weather, such as light and dark, shadows..., are also not missed or ignored at all.</p>
<p>Maybe it sounds too verbose to say that. The above two sets are what I think are the best; the remaining three sets of Five Rivers, Pleasant Studio, and Indian Stories are slightly less, but the tendency is consistent; very realistic.</p>
<p>These are works from Russia and France. Germany's works, which are considered to have the most developed woodcuts, are not there. In quantity, it seems very small, but in quality, it is purely a fine product. There are only eight French woodcuts, and the rest are paintings, with a strong taste of beauty; Russia is all woodcuts, but they are realistic subjects. From this, the different tendencies of the two countries can be seen.</p>
<h3>Small Trinkets</h3>
<p>— Qing Nong</p>
<p>One afternoon, it was as if people were crying from sorrow. The leaden sky with a face like that moved with dark gray clouds. The shop curtains on the street were blown restlessly by the autumn wind. I squeezed through the tide of people and cars and walked to the Great English Avenue of the Paris of the East. That day was a Sunday. The men and women, gentlemen and ladies, all carried items bought from the "Big Sale" store, and they were all crowded on the sidewalks, thronging at the entrance of the "Big Sale" store. The people of Shanghai liked buying things that much. I was infected by this atmosphere, and suddenly I also wanted to buy one or two daily necessities that I had wanted for a long time but hadn't bought. But when I felt my pocket, I didn't have enough money. Just when I was half envying people and half jealous of them, and half hating myself for not bringing money out, I walked past the entrance of the Continental Emporium and encountered a little rascal holding a few rubber horses and dogs, small trinkets, and hawking them. It reminded me that I was going to see a friend and might as well buy a dog for her baby to play with. I had a motive in my heart, and the little rascal earnestly urged me to buy. Only two small foreign coins could get a dog. Why not spend this little money? I bought it and held it in my hand, asking him if he had paper to wrap it. He didn't. So I just held it in my hand. Walking on the road, I felt very happy. Looking at the people, I told myself, "I bought something too." But holding such a large rubber dog in my hand, holding its head felt awkward, holding its feet felt awkward too. I unconsciously felt constrained, as if the eyes of the passersby were criticizing my posture as wrong, and as if they were all criticizing me for holding a rubber dog, a small toy for children, in my hand. Finally, the rubber dog was turned over and over in my hand as I walked. And I always felt restless in my heart. Should I take the tram? The road is so far, and it's embarrassing to walk with the dog in my hand. So I got on the tram. On the tram, people looked at me, strangely! I felt a blush on my face, a little hot.</p>
<p>"Easterner!" said a worker-like man in a blue cloth jacket next to me to his friend, glancing at me disdainfully.</p>
<p>Easterner? Me? My heart jumped, startled by the humiliation I had suffered last year during the Shanghai war because my appearance resembled that of an Easterner. I quickly said to him, "I'm not. I'm not an Easterner." He sneered and smoked his cigarette. His friend, also a worker-like man in a blue cloth jacket, looked at me deeply a few times and shook his head, saying, "No, Cantonese." Saved! His friend had good eyesight.</p>
<p>"Easterners speak Shanghai dialect like that. Isn't the amah in the factory speaking with that strange accent?"</p>
<p>"Cantonese people also speak Shanghai dialect the same way as Easterners."</p>
<p>"I'm definitely Cantonese! I can prove it by speaking Shanghai dialect!" I eagerly tried to prove it to him.</p>
<p>He looked at me carefully again, half believing and half doubting, and suddenly saw the rubber dog in my hand.</p>
<p>"Look, he's still holding Japanese goods!" His attitude had gone from disdain to contempt!</p>
<p>Japanese goods? My heart panicked. I quickly examined the rubber dog in my hand. Oh no! On the dog's leg were English words stating "Made in Japan" and the trademark! This time, without his reprimand, my face was already burning as if on fire, and my heart was pounding.</p>
<p>"I bought it on the Great Avenue. I didn't know it was Japanese goods!" I said defensively.</p>
<p>The person next to me on the right said sympathetically, "Most of the things sold on the street are Japanese goods."</p>
<p>I didn't dare to talk to the two workers anymore. To cover up my shame and explain my reasons, I talked to the person who had spoken about how I bought the rubber dog.</p>
<p>"Two dimes? Chen Jiageng's are only four dimes!"</p>
<p>That person seemed to be a shop assistant, and said this as if he was very knowledgeable about prices, and my face became even more ashamed and hot.</p>
<p>When the tram arrived at my destination, I wished I could jump out of the window. I arrived at my friend's house. The child, upon seeing the rubber dog, was so happy that he opened his little mouth and shouted "Dog, dog," almost not wanting to eat dinner. Although I suffered a lot for this little toy, the child's happiness was enough to compensate for my loss.</p>
<h3>Small Notes from a Guest Window</h3>
<p>— Shu</p>
<p>Twelve</p>
<p>Wandering around the Fen Bookstore, I inadvertently purchased the revised edition in three volumes of "Ming Letters and Ink Flowers" compiled by Huang Benji (Nue Teng). The book contains mostly short letters from people of the Ming Dynasty, copied by the editor from various calligraphic works. The upper volume includes letters from thirty families, including Nie Danian, with fifty-nine letters; the middle volume includes ninety-three letters from Dong Qichang; and the lower volume includes seventy-three letters from twenty-one families, including Chen Jiru. Among them are many rare and excellent works. The editor's comments on letters are also profound. I especially love what he said in the preface:</p>
<p>"Only short notes and personal letters are written by hand, discussing national policies, friendships, or trivial household matters, extremely small and subtle things. Generally, they are written hastily without any pretense of embellishment. A few words are circulated among people, and the author's purity or corruption, the nature of their temperament, often unconsciously revealed."</p>
<p>And in the postscript to Dong Qichang's letters, he said: "Picked up at random, without being particular about paper or brush, its casual and unadorned style is naturally full of meaning, often with a wonderful sense that the writing cannot fully express the meaning, and the brush cannot fully express the intention." This particularly captures the essence of short letters. However, many later letter writers have taken a different path. Although there are such short notes—beautiful articles—they are mostly imitations of predecessors, soulless works without content. Thus, one cannot recognize the author from such letters; they are merely imitations and translations of ancient letters, which I find meaningless.</p>
<h3>Two Brothers (53)</h3>
<p>— Written by Maupassant, Translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter," Mr. Roland continued, "you can't just slip away like a barbarian because of this."</p>
<p>Mrs. Lu tried to smooth things over, saying:</p>
<p>"No, no, he left with English politeness; people often slip away from a large crowd like that when they have urgent business."</p>
<p>"Ah!" Zhe'an replied, "It's possible in a large crowd, but no one uses English politeness to deal with their own family, and my brother has been specializing in this lately."</p>
<p>Six</p>
<p>For a week or two, everything at the Roland's house was as usual. The father went fishing, Zhe'an and his mother were busy preparing for the new store, and Bi'er looked very gloomy, only seen at mealtimes.</p>
<p>One evening, his father asked him:</p>
<p>"What ghosts have you seen that you've been wearing such a long face for so long? I didn't just notice it today."</p>
<p>The doctor replied:</p>
<p>"It's because I feel the heavy burden of life."</p>
<p>The honest old man didn't understand what he meant at all. He said with a worried face:</p>
<p>"Really, it's too much. Ever since we were lucky enough to get this inheritance, everyone has seemed unhappy. It's as if something bad has happened to us, as if we're mourning someone!"</p>
<p>"I am mourning someone," Bi'er said.</p>
<p>"You? Mourning whom?"</p>
<p>"Ah! Someone you don't know, but someone I love dearly."</p>
<p>Old Roland thought this was a romantic entanglement, referring to a frivolous woman his son was involved with. He asked:</p>
<p>"It must be a woman, right?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it's a woman."</p>
<p>"Is she dead?"</p>
<p>"No, worse than dead, she has lost her honor."</p>
<p>"Ah!"</p>
<p>The old man felt strange hearing his son say this unexpected secret in a strange tone in front of his woman, but he thought this kind of thing was no one else's business, so he didn't ask further.</p>
<p>Mrs. Roland seemed not to have heard at all; her face was pale as if she was sick. Her husband had several times unexpectedly seen her sit down as if collapsing into a chair, and heard her panting as if she could no longer breathe. He said to her at this time:</p>
<p>"Really, Louise, your face looks very bad. You must be too tired from preparing the new house for Zhe'an! You should rest a little! Since there's money now, there's no rush."</p>
<p>She shook her head and didn't answer.</p>
<p>Her face was so pale today that Roland noticed her again.</p>
<p>"Hey, this won't do. You should get treated," he said.</p>

<h3>Dean Dai's Humor</h3>
<p>— Wei Ba</p>
<p>Under the large headline "Examination Yuan Holds Certificate Award Ceremony" in this newspaper on the 3rd of this month, I saw a small piece of news, which tasted like eating an olive. Following the principle of "sharing remarkable articles," I will transcribe the original text as follows: Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The Examination Yuan held a certificate award ceremony for the second session of the Higher Examination today. During the three minutes of silence in the ceremony, the master of ceremonies called "Silence Ended" after only a few seconds. Dai Chuanxian was furious and subsequently recorded the master of ceremonies' demerit and requested the National Government to punish him.</p>
<p>Upon first reading this article, I felt it had the style of the "Analects School," suspecting it was written by Lin Yutang. Upon rereading, it was indeed a Nanjing special dispatch. Upon reading it a third time, I deeply sighed at Dean Dai's sincerity and reverence, leaving no detail unattended. The master of ceremonies' crime of negligence, the demerit punishment, was truly deserved.</p>
<p>The Book of Changes says: "Treading on frost, solid ice arrives." The gentleman sees this as a sign of knowing the significant from the minor. Our Dean Dai, although he has been immersed in Buddhist studies for years, is also well-versed in the Book of Changes. Because if "three minutes" can be shortened to "a few seconds," then "Three Principles" can also be shortened to "One Principle." Lying in front of the Premier's portrait is simply a bit of a joke. How could it not betray the principles of "not relaxing day and night" and "being faithful and loyal"? If he didn't get angry at this, when would he get angry! Thus, Dean Dai, despite his deep cultivation, could not help but break the five and six precepts and "record the master of ceremonies' demerit." Only the "requesting punishment for himself" part is inevitably taking the blame for someone else. Perhaps this is also a sign of responsibility, also showing the unyielding spirit of a great politician, which can serve as a model for future generations.</p>
<p>However, it seems that the "disrespectful" events in recent years are not limited to this one. Time can be checked with clocks, and politics can also be verified against "ancient texts." However, Dean Dai is not angry before, not angry after, not angry to the left, not angry to the right, but precisely angry at an unnamed and unknown master of ceremonies. Why is that? Some say this is Dean Dai's "humor," but if so, I cannot help but shout "injustice" for that master of ceremonies!</p>
<h3>It's Still Better to Heal Your Own Heart First</h3>
<p>— Jing An</p>
<p>If a machine breaks down, a technician is needed to repair it. If a person gets sick, a doctor is needed to treat them. Therefore, doctors have a very close relationship with humans. If a doctor is good, they can be a lifesaver for humans. If a doctor is bad, they become a murderer. The so-called good doctor has two essential conditions: medical skill and medical ethics. With profound medical skill and good medical ethics, one can truly seek happiness for humans and protect the health of the nation. Currently, there are more doctors who are skilled in medicine, but although there are many with good medical ethics, those who are bad, cunning, and deceptive are still the majority. If a patient encounters a doctor with good medical ethics, they naturally have a chance to survive; otherwise, they will be deceived by the doctor, or even killed by the doctor! Because many doctors set high consultation fees, and if the patient cannot pay that fee, they will not be treated, or the treatment will be delayed, or it will be done carelessly. People who are sick are in great pain, even on the verge of death. How can you delay? How can you be careless? Delaying and being careless will surely result in the loss of someone's life. Doctors in Shanghai are the most arrogant. For example, an outpatient visit is one or two yuan, but a house call is ten or twenty yuan, and it doubles at night or for long distances. There are even more inhumane evils, such as charging double the consultation fee for crossing a concession. For example, if the original fee for the Public Concession is ten yuan, it will be thirty yuan to call them to the French Concession, and if it is at night, it will double again, so even the cost of a coffin will have to be handed over to them! Even if they come to see you, they may not be able to cure you, so it's better for poor families to keep the money for the coffin!</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, it is not necessarily the doctor's fault; because patients often think that doctors of the aristocratic type, with high consultation and medication fees, will definitely be able to cure them; if the medical fees are low, they always regard it as murderous arsenic. Such people are very common in the world. I once saw a doctor say in a certain publication: "A person suffering from venereal disease asked a very cruel doctor to inject 606 and spent twenty yuan; later, the disease had not yet healed, and the doctor had to go to another place for business, so he asked another doctor to inject it. This doctor was a bit more honest and only charged him five yuan, but the patient was shocked and uneasy, wondering why the price was so different? So he suspected that it was fake, and even after the doctor repeatedly explained, he still didn't believe it, insisting on finding a 606 that cost twenty yuan a shot. In the end, he spent the money, but the disease was still the same." How wrong is the mentality of such a patient? They suspect the honest doctor of selling fake medicine, but they think the cruel doctor is selling elixir. Isn't this recognizing a thief as your father? From this, we can see that the doctor's medical ethics are already bad, and the patient's mentality is also wrong, which is why people in the world are plagued by diseases. But thinking deeply, did the doctor become bad first, or did the patient make a mistake first? According to the example above, of course, the patient made a mistake first. A Chinese medicine doctor named He in Shanghai also thinks so. He said: "Ten years ago, a doctor took a rickshaw to see a patient in a wealthy family. After entering the door, the family whispered: 'The doctor is riding in a rickshaw.' Later, I heard that the patient refused to take his medicine because of this." Like this, only paying attention to the doctor's vehicle and not paying attention to the doctor's medical skills is of course the patient's fault, but I think that the root cause is still due to the doctor becoming bad first. Because human psychology is selfish, former patients, no matter how wealthy they were, always hoped to cure their illness with extremely low medical expenses; on the other hand, doctors have the power of life and death, and the result is that doctors always win. Today, this bad habit is firmly entrenched, and everyone thinks that spending more money on medical treatment is good, so the trouble was started by the doctor. For example, charging double for crossing a concession is also like this. Before there was this example, I was afraid that no wealthy person would give double the consultation fee for no reason, or that the patient would refuse the doctor to see him if the consultation fee was not increased. Now that this example has been set, if a doctor dares to break the rule and not charge extra, people will surely think that he is an incompetent doctor. So it must be the doctor who became bad first, and then the patient made a mistake. It is definitely not the patient who made a mistake first, and then the doctor became bad. This has become an iron case!</p>
<p>I really don't understand why the heart of the doctor who claims to save lives is still so cruel, especially the current Western doctors. The consultation fee is already high, and the price of medicine is also expensive. Even going to an outpatient visit once costs at least several yuan. If you say that your medical and drug costs are expensive, and you want to get more interest, then I am afraid that there is no such good business in the world. If you say that the standard of living is getting higher and higher, and monthly income of hundreds of yuan is not enough to cover expenses, then you are even more lying with a clear conscience, recognizing that doctors are a special class. Even ordinary people need to earn that much to survive, so all the people with monthly incomes of dozens of yuan or several yuan must starve to death! I think that the higher the standard of living, the more difficult the life of the general public, and the more doctors should release their bodhisattva hearts to save people. The day the standard of living increases is the time for doctors to do good and accumulate merit! If you take the opportunity to collect more medical expenses from patients when the standard of living is high, it is like "robbing a burning house," a murderer who slaughters humans! They are the public enemy of mankind, and we should beat the drums and attack them! Therefore, I hope that doctors with good medical ethics can strive to serve the society in the future, and the income from consultation fees should only be enough to maintain a life of simple clothes and coarse food; doctors with bad medical ethics can correct their past mistakes in order to benefit the crowd. "Saving a life" is already "worth a thousand gold," why ask for more compensation?</p>

<h3>About Sesame Flatbread and Fried Dough Sticks</h3>
<p>— Wen Bing</p>
<p>Although the title is so low, I must first narrate a revolutionary anecdote.</p>
<p>It is said that a certain important person has chewed sesame flatbread and fried dough sticks. Since his life was so low, he was naturally a neighborhood hero, his heart was full of anger, and his spirit was very high. Then, the taste of sesame flatbread and fried dough sticks might be as palatable and filling as Western cuisine. Under their various beautiful disguises, many ordinary people faithfully admired them, so the revolution had a foundation, with ever-changing tricks, vigorously chanting slogans, and after one or two more national crises, the emperor in the court shouted, "Sincere unity." So everyone joined forces, and the neighborhood hero transformed into an important person of the era.</p>
<p>Naturally, in this process, there were also crowds of gong players and porters. When these people saw that the revolution had succeeded, they naturally had to drop their gongs, throw away their carrying poles, rise in rank, and receive some revolutionary fruit juice to fill the holes all over their bodies caused by running around. So they went to knock on the door of the important person.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the times were completely different. The important person also changed his face. At first, he treated them with a smiling face, saying nice things, and writing checks. But the people went every day, and there were so many of them that the important person felt an unprecedented annoyance and became unfriendly. So the gong players and porters were unbearable. It is said that they pointed at the important person's fat face in an uncivilized way and cursed shamelessly. Some even resorted to violence. The only reason was:</p>
<p>"You forgot the time when we chewed sesame flatbread and fried dough sticks together! You forgot the time when we chewed sesame flatbread and fried dough sticks together!"</p>
<p>As for whether the fruits of the revolution were evenly distributed as a result of the cursing and fighting, and whether they were able to join the beloved and sincere members of the sesame flatbread and fried dough sticks era, sharing the sweets and bitters of life, it is not very clear.</p>
<p>In short, there was such a comedy on the revolutionary stage.</p>
<p>We ordinary people understand very well that although sesame flatbread and fried dough sticks can be chewed by anyone, not just anyone can understand them thoroughly. Chewing sesame flatbread and fried dough sticks by the intellectual class is often unreliable. As for the revolutionary comrades and activists who sell dog meat, chewing sesame flatbread and fried dough sticks is simply the height of absurdity. When chewing, they do chew one by one, strip by strip, and perhaps everyone chews the sesame flatbread and fried dough sticks fairly. But once there is an opportunity to sell their souls, they throw everything away and move away on their own. In other words, they only chewed them at a certain time because they were still far from the stage of "exploitation" and their pockets were empty. Once they climbed up and started using the exploitation mirror and unleashed their claws, the situation was different, and their pockets quickly filled up. After that, they not only wouldn't chew sesame flatbread and fried dough sticks, but they wouldn't even eat super Chinese food. They had to chew Western cuisine to satisfy their addiction and make their stomachs stick out. At the same time, in order to chew Western cuisine, the oil could not be dispersed, so the previous partners would inevitably have to be thrown away.</p>
<p>The people who can truly chew sesame flatbread and fried dough sticks, not only in China but all over the world, are only some manual laborers. They don't know anything about "biting on vegetable roots to become rich and noble." In fact, their fate is thus determined to be bitter. Even sesame flatbread and fried dough sticks sometimes become a cause for panic. It is not that they really don't even have the share of sesame flatbread and fried dough sticks, but because the important people indirectly and directly dig up their sesame flatbread and fried dough sticks and move them to their Western cuisine tables to be fried in oil.</p>
<h3>Gunshot</h3>
<p>— Jing Jia</p>
<p>The woman selling evening newspapers came later tonight than usual. The clock struck seven before I saw her hand me the newspaper with a frightened face.</p>
<p>"You're so late!" I complained.</p>
<p>"Didn't you hear the gunshots, sir?" she said breathlessly.</p>
<p>"Gunshots?" I asked in surprise. Even my younger brother, who was crying for pennies to buy clay figures, became quiet.</p>
<p>"Yes, right at ×× Road intersection. Didn't you hear?"</p>
<p>"No. What happened?"</p>
<p>"Catching robbers. The robbers fired guns, and the police fired guns too. In the end, the robbers ran away, and a woman passing by was shot dead in front of the ××× restaurant. It was terrible. A hole went from her back to her chest. Blood flowed all over that part of the sidewalk."</p>
<p>"Ah!" my younger brother cried out.</p>
<p>"Aren't you going to take a look, sir?" she said and left. I followed her out immediately.</p>
<p>When I arrived there, it was crowded with people. They were separated in groups, talking about what had happened. In the middle of the crowd, a woman was lying down. Blood was still flowing. Next to her was a girl crying loudly, wearing tattered clothes. It was said that she was the dead woman's child.</p>
<p>I deliberately squeezed into the middle of those who were talking, in order to find out more details. It was said that the dead woman was a female beggar, with no one else except that child. They were all sighing and giving the crying child some sympathy.</p>
<p>But, I was happy for the dead woman, although it was a bit too cruel. Leaving this sad world is stronger than begging people for a penny on the street corner, isn't it? At least, she doesn't need to worry about tomorrow's sesame flatbread.</p>
<p>Only the child is pitiful. However, some empty sympathy cannot save her. I believe she must hate the robbers. Without the robbers, she would not have become a helpless orphan. However, she cannot understand how robbers are produced. The world is so big, but it is also so small, so small that there is not even a place to stand.</p>

<h3>Wanderers Want a Home - Want a Family</h3>
<p>Editor Sir:</p>
<p>Why must I endure so many setbacks and hardships? I have asked myself, but I cannot clearly tell myself: perhaps even you cannot solve this problem. Loneliness, poverty, even the inability to go on living, make me doubt this question even more. For all these reasons, I have no choice but to confide in you, to confide in readers who sympathize with me, even if there is nothing… But it is good to release a mouthful of pent-up frustration! Alas! Editor Sir: I am a person who has nothing!</p>
<p>A person without parents, without a hometown, without anything else! Perhaps I am the only one so pitiful in the world! Here, I don't need to recite history or an autobiography -- and the space does not allow me; simply put: I am a homeless child, my parents died too early; in this selfish world, who is willing to pity this orphan? Because I don't want to die, I struggle hard while hungry and cold -- trying to live day by day, always wandering aimlessly day by day. I am truly fortunate to have learned a few words from reading newspapers on the street: at the same time, I am truly unfortunate that knowing these few words makes me feel pain. If I were like the me before the age of twelve -- illiterate -- then perhaps I wouldn't have such problems now!</p>
<p>For several years, I have wanted to find a few friends in Shanghai who would sympathize with me and give me some help in spirit and learning. Heavens! In the end, I am still disappointed. Where are my friends -- friends who can give me sympathy and comfort?</p>
<p>Although I can now study at a middle school for free; "materialism" dominates my heart, it really makes a fool of me. I don't have money to buy books? I don't have money to buy paper, pens, and ink? Heavens, it's getting cold again, clothes! What can I do! Editor Sir, I, who am in this situation, how embarrassing is it? Moreover, I have suffered the torment of life in the past, and I am covered in scars. I want a home, I need a place to belong, but I am a wanderer, what can I do!</p>
<p>Editor Sir, I believe that there are sympathetic friends, but they have not been found or there is no opportunity. Even if everything else is nothing, at least you will give me some sympathy, right!</p>
<p>I remember Mr. Tian Lu did a good deed for a certain lady in Qingguang, although I am male, please publish it for me too! Perhaps in this "man eats man" society, there are still many friends who sympathize with me.</p>
<p>I cannot go on living, the shadow of suicide revolves around me.</p>
<p>Editor Sir and dear readers! Which path should I take? Can you give me an answer? I am waiting here, looking forward to it! Sincerely wishing you</p>
<p>Well-being, Ping</p>
<p>Editor's note: Man is an animal that lives a spiritual life, so he can be a wanderer in material things, but he must find a home in spirit. With a home, life will have impetus and meaning.</p>
<p>Home -- is indeed generally regarded as the spiritual home, but the destination of man is by no means only the home. Great achievements and academics, small carvings and trivial skills, can also be my home.</p>
<p>Ping is a wanderer, and finding a home is indeed necessary. But it is not necessary to take the home as the home. Ping, please consider it a little, and you will realize that at least in your current situation, the home cannot comfort you. Ping, Ping, quickly find your home outside the home!</p>

<h3>Shanghai (Fifteen)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Lao San</p>
<p>I caught up and grabbed her arm, wanting to say something back to her, but I was too embarrassed to say it, and swallowed it down in my throat. "Say it!"</p>
<p>"I want… I really want to write her a letter."</p>
<p>"That's not what you wanted to say." Sister Min broke free from my hand and suddenly said solemnly, "You should write her a letter!"</p>
<p>The waning moon shyly poked its head out from the east, and we slowly walked home, stepping on the fragmented shadows of the moon.</p>
<p>Twenty-Four Bridges</p>
<p>Two days later, we received my younger brother's letter and went to the train station to wait for the special express train from Hangzhou. I casually said to Sister Min:</p>
<p>"I didn't expect that when I left my family this time, I would be able to bring my younger brother to Shanghai with me; I didn't expect that you would also leave your stepfather's sphere of influence at the same time. From the time Mom passed away until now, we have run onto the same path, it must be fate, right?"</p>
<p>Sister Min looked at me for a long time. I felt I had misspoke. The train happened to be slowly entering the station, and we mingled in the crowd and walked forward. My younger brother had already seen us and leaned half his body out of the window, waving the white cloth in his hand. The bright smile on his apple-like face showed that his small heart was full of joy. The train slowly stopped, and he rushed to be the first to jump off the train and stared at Sister Min, as if wanting to say something.</p>
<p>"Sister Min, do you recognize him?" I asked.</p>
<p>"It looks like I've seen him somewhere." She tilted her head to think.</p>
<p>"Nonsense!"</p>
<p>"Really, Brother!" He held Sister Min's hand, "Once, I saw you near the little bridge, aren't you Sister Min?"</p>
<p>"Where?" I became suspicious.</p>
<p>"It's that little bridge." My younger brother raised his hand as if wanting to point, but bumped into a porter.</p>
<p>"Good memory!" Sister Min said, stroking his head.</p>
<p>"Good constancy!" I smiled.</p>
<p>"Brother didn't say nonsense." My younger brother walked in the middle, he looked up at us.</p>
<p>Stepping out of the station from the noisy sounds of the inn's reception, I thought of the rickshaw driver from the night before.</p>
<p>"Where to?" I asked Sister Min.</p>
<p>"Route Lafayette!"</p>
<p>I smiled to myself. Sister Min also seemed to understand something, and took my younger brother's hand and said:</p>
<p>"Let's take the tram."</p>
<p>This was my younger brother's first time in Shanghai. He looked at everything with great surprise. When the tram drove onto the Garbage Bridge, he said:</p>
<p>"Brother," this bridge is very big. When he saw the turbid Huangpu River below, "It's not as fun as in the countryside."</p>
<p>Twenty-Fifth Sister is Coming</p>
<p>Two months later, with the efforts of the members of the Golden Body Society, the magazine was also restored. Everyone put aside their opinions and did their best to fulfill their responsibilities. The school was personally presided over by Gao Fei. The school address was our club. The only difference was that this time it was not a voluntary service. A minimum tuition fee was charged, because we did not have any unexpected income. The magazine was entrusted to me. After a few voluntary calls for submissions were issued, the restored issue already had submissions from the outside world. Sister Min was very interested in literature. The essays she wrote were beautiful and gentle. Chongqing Xiaofeng could also write articles. This magazine income was all of our basic funds.</p>
<p>It was an early summer evening, and swarms of moths were already flying around under the incandescent light. We were sorting out the drafts for the second issue of Zhengyi when my younger brother ran in and called me:</p>

<h3>Famous Failures in Film History (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Jia Gu</p>
<p>Failure is inevitable for every big star, big director, and big producer. Sometimes, the combination of two great minds creates a failed film. For example, Mary Pickford's (Rosita). At that time, a big German film called (Passion) had just arrived in the United States and was welcomed by the American public. The protagonist of that film was Pola Negri; the director was the famous Ernst Lubitsch. Mary thought that since Pola Negri could do so well, she herself would not be worse, but she had to find a way to invite Lubitsch to the United States. Lubitsch also agreed, because he knew that this American sweetheart was an extremely intelligent woman, so he gladly accepted. They then cooperated to the best of their ability to shoot that (Rosita), but the result was a failure. However, Mary Pickford and Lubitsch were too famous, and their reputation and future were not greatly affected.</p>
<p>Charlie Chaplin has also made films that were not even worth the cost of the film. He made a film called "A Woman of Paris". Because he wanted to be the director himself, he found a man and a woman in Paris to film the movie. The result was a mess. But strangely, it created a star, namely Adolphe Menjou, who played the male lead.</p>
<p>The glorious director Cecil B. DeMille has also had failures. His reputation was briefly affected by (The Godless Girl). That film depicted the darkness in women's reformatories, but it was too cruel and not suitable for social customs, so it failed. He also made (Joan the Woman), which told the story of Joan of Arc's life. That was also a complete failure, but strangely enough, this failure not only did not damage his reputation, but also helped his career and created a big star, Wallace Reid. So failure is like lightning, elusive.</p>
<p>Erich von Stroheim is a very special director. The films he makes are either a great success or a great failure. It doesn't matter much to him whether he is driving a sinking ship or an invincible battleship. The Merry Widow was his great success, earning countless money. But Greed and The Wedding March were unparalleled failures. Everything in Greed was a representative of things that no one wanted to see, but the company actually allowed him to finish the entire film. This can only be attributed to fate.</p>
<p>After succeeding with the great historical drama (The Covered Wagon), James Cruze made (Beggar on Horseback), and his glorious record from the previous film was covered up by the second film. (In the Palace of the King), directed by Emmet Flynn, and (Mare Nostrum), directed by Rex Ingram, both caused their reputations to decline. Probably, if a director as famous as King Vidor made two failed films in a row, if he did not have the ability to rebound strongly, then his career would be over. (End)</p>
<p>Erratum: The second section of this article published yesterday contained the phrase "Camille" (Salome), which was a mistake for "Salome". This is hereby corrected.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "Orders Is Orders"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Under the contradictory political system, we have discovered this miracle. British filmmakers are making fun of the military.</p>
<p>What is an order? "An order is an order," is the biggest feature of the military. However, some people think this is very ridiculous. Isn't that right? This film is a direct satire of the military. At the same time, the producer explains everything from his own perspective. On the one hand, the author praises the strict discipline of the military, but on the other hand, he depicts their corruption. The military authorities were initially unwilling to allow the filmmakers to shoot the film, but later, because the producers "explained in every possible way", they finally borrowed the military to shoot the conflict between the Indian garrison and the rebels -- the so-called historical "Nafuk" incident. However, in the end, because the film was about national civilization, the film was burned by accident.</p>
<p>We do not believe that the British army is really as ridiculous as the film says, but comparing the life of the film and the life of the military is even more interesting. After watching, a large group of women walked into the barracks, making the soldiers beaming, and actually drinking and having fun in the solemn barracks. The general's high-spirited appearance contrasted with the female director's frivolousness, and people in the film actually gambled in the barracks, and the general could only shake his head when he saw it. These are all very interesting satires, but the main thing is that the finished film was burned for the sake of national honor. From this, we can know what they are trying to cover up. In this play, the author deliberately refuses to let the producer succumb to military orders, so he uses the carelessness of two soldiers to burn it. As for the scene of the Indian rebels' riot, the fact that it was faked to be real is even more vivid.</p>
<p>Although Walter Ford's name is unfamiliar to the Chinese, his directing achievements are commendable. It is also a comedy, but under the hands of the British, it is definitely not as exaggerated as the Americans. I think the achievement here is that the feeling of reality occurs in the comedy. For example, the sketch of military life before and after, the continuous close-ups of faces when delivering orders. The adjustment of fast and slow tempo all prove the director's intelligence and experience.</p>
<p>The old actor who played the head of the regiment has a real talent for acting, not frivolous but connotative, not exaggerated but natural, which can be said to be rare. As for James Gleeson, who often plays the role of a coach in American Westerns, is consistently American in style here. No matter how hard he tries, he will not be pleasing in the end.</p>
<h3>Review of "The Miracle Woman"</h3>
<p>— Moore</p>
<p>This "Miracle Woman" is a rare masterpiece among American films in terms of meaning. Here, we see how the "daughters of God" ruthlessly replace the honest, poor, and sick old pastor, and must have his daughter replace his sermon. Here we can see that people organize religious organizations in order to "use and make money", specializing in religious healing, or claiming to turn the suffering into joy, but we see that people use religion to call out, and as a result, even destroy the tools (pastors). We should know this kind of religious interior, and old artists are not easily willing to expose it, but "The Miracle Woman" explains it.</p>
<p>Of course, the author of "The Miracle Woman" is not standing on an anti-religious stance very correctly. He just believes that people use religion, and religion itself is not bad, so he borrows the mouth of a girl to scold the preaching audience as hypocritical, and he writes the aviator John Gagen as an honest believer. But the producer of "The Miracle Woman" is not a supporter of religion either. This can be seen in the fact that John Gagen rescued the little girl in the end, "so he and the girl found another way to make a living", and never wanted to go to religion again. At least he thought that religion was not bad, but it was an empty thing. His meaning is that religion can be temporarily abandoned. The reason is naturally because some people use religion, but do not understand the "opium" effect of religion itself. It is remarkable that European and American old artists are willing to advocate this.</p>
<p>Although the meaning of "The Miracle Woman" is quite desirable, its technology "even if it is old" is extremely clumsy. At first glance, I say this has a tendency of dualism between content and form. In fact, it is not, because the old form is only suitable for the old content, and the new content must also have a new form. Since the content of "The Miracle Woman" is quite advanced, and the new form has not yet grown well in the current American film industry, the author can only use the older form. Undoubtedly, he is therefore uncoordinated and unsuitable, and the result is a lose-lose situation. The maturity of the new form must be a slow and gradual development, not a leap. The formal failure of "The Miracle Woman" precisely confirms the monism of content and form. For example, when a girl scolds the audience on the pulpit for being hypocritical, no matter what, she must be stern, and at the same time, because she is a preacher, she must have a quiet and solemn attitude. Now, the heroine's performance in "The Miracle Woman" is like a song girl performing to the audience, and the director also uses short shots that change quickly like a stage song. Undoubtedly, because the heroine is used to being a "song and dance beauty", and the director is also used to making erotic films. In this kind of place, we will definitely "understand each other". As for the lack of religious atmosphere among the masses, it was originally able to help explain that the audience did not sincerely believe in religion, especially in the preaching scene, but it was not worth the loss.</p>
<p>In short, in terms of meaning, "The Miracle Woman" is a good work. In particular, people who say "it is ridiculous to ask for the correct consciousness from American films" should pay more attention. Although "The Miracle Woman" is not 100% correct, what about those who are more sensual and grotesque?</p>
<h3>Recent News from Southern Company</h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>Since the release of the first product of Southern Company, the sound film "White Gold Dragon", the second sound film was originally planned to be produced as "Poison Rose". After Xue Juexian returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday, he heard that the plan had been changed. He will first shoot "Hate Not Meeting When Not Married", a play that Xue was proud of on the Cantonese stage. In terms of actors, in addition to Xue and his wife Ms. Tang Xueqing, the senior figure in the film industry Wang Yuanlong and Ms. Hu Shan or Ms. Tan Xuerong, the basic actors of Tianyi Company, will be invited to cooperate. The results are expected to be better than "White Gold Dragon". The play has been completed in acts and is expected to start work within the next ten days.</p>
<h3>Monster Enthusiastically Patriotic</h3>
<p>The monster Shen Xiling's directed "Shanghai Twenty-Four Hours" has now been filmed to nine-tenths. Yesterday, the reporter met Shen Xiling and asked him how many scenes were left. He said that there was still a dance scene set in the interior, and a scene at the entrance of the Grand Shanghai Grand Theater in the exterior. The reporter asked again: "Didn't you originally plan to shoot at the entrance of the Grand Guangming Grand Theater?" The monster said coquettishly, "Guangming is opened by foreigners, we don't shoot, we want to be patriotic!"</p>
<h3>Salt Tide [Soon to be Released P] Because of its strong anti-imperialist consciousness, "Vanilla Beauty" was rejected by the concession authorities and banned from screening. Currently, the Star Company authorities are arguing with reason, hoping to meet the audience in the concession soon. Following "Vanilla Beauty", the film to be released at the New Light Theater will be "Salt Tide", which was shot by Xu Xinfu after traveling back and forth between Shanghai and Hangzhou more than ten times. The exterior location of the film is at Ganpu, the "Eastern Great Port", and it was very difficult to shoot. Therefore, the release of "Salt Tide" is a memorable event for the film industry. Also: Empress Hu Die is said to be compiling her autobiography. "Salt Tide" is the first time she has been barefoot in front of the camera under the direction of Dai Xinfu: this should also be an important page in her autobiography. Movie Novel Flower Calyx Love (Little Woman) (Four)</h3>
<p>Suxin</p>
<p>They were inevitably a little restrained when they first met, but as the waiter brought tea and snacks, they gradually became happy. He told her that his name was originally Theodore, but everyone called him Lawrie. He also told her that he knew their names. He said: (You are always so interesting, I, I can't help but peek at you often. Said Qiao); "Then from now on, we won't draw the curtains, let you watch as much as you want. But, if you are staring like that, why don't you come over and play with us? We welcome you. Lawrie gladly accepted her request, because he felt that his father would agree. Qiao looked at the large oil painting hanging on the wall, and she said to herself; "Look, if you get close to him, he may not be that scary." Her clear voice reached the ears of two people in the living room. One was Brooke, who came to teach. He listened to Qiao's words and looked awkwardly at his boss and said; "I'll wait downstairs for a while." He said and hurried downstairs. Mr. Lawrence approached the meeting room. Qiao and Lawrie didn't notice him. Qiao said again: "I'm not afraid of him. But his appearance is so frightening. His eyes are very kind, I like him very much, but his bark must be scary." Lawrie said: "You haven't seen him when he is furious." Lawrence came in, and he said angrily to Qiao: "Good, you are not afraid of me?" Qiao was so frightened that she couldn't speak. She stammered: "No, no, no, not very afraid." Her legs were shaking. Lawrence said, "Isn't my appearance frightening?" Qiao retorted; "I said maybe it is," Lawrence didn't let go and said; "I can bark, can't I?" Qiao said: "That's accidental." Lawrence asked again: "Even so, but you still like me, don't you?" Qiao then realized that the old man was teasing her. She quickly said; "Yes, that's right, I like you very much." The old man's frosty face melted, and he said; "I also like you." Qiao was about to go home, and the old man happily sent her to the door himself. In this way, although the South was fighting fiercely, although they were worried about their father's safety, although they were troubled by poverty, although they had the pain of teaching all the children in the family, although the aunt's temper was strange, the March family was also harmonious and spent the winter. The four little girls often went to his house at Mr. Lawrence's request and played with Lawrie. Meg and John Brooke hit it off, and they often went out to play together after coming out of church on Sundays. Qiao looked at the budding love between the two and secretly worried. Beth's piano was broken. Lawrence often invited her to his house to use his piano. Qiao often engaged in writing when she was free. One day Lawrie saw Qiao coming out of a newspaper office. He asked her what she was doing at the newspaper office. Because Lawrie asked too urgently, Qiao gave him a check to see, which said pay Miss Qiao March one yuan and fifty cents. She told him that it was the money for selling a section of the novel. Lawrie shouted; "Hurray, Miss March, the famous American female writer!" From then on, Lawrie admired Qiao even more.
