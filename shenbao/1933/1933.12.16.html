<p>現今世界交通發達。海洋之限。山嶺之隔。均已爲人工所打破。而於鄰近之國家。無論爲仇爲友。尤不能完全隔離彼此間之經濟關聯。政治上之一張一弛。亦易發生影響。在歐洲英法德意諸國。其歷史上遺留之問題。誠不易一一清算。而彼此間關係之密接。則殊難否認。遠東之中日兩國。就實際利害而論。固未必悉皆衝突。不過自瀋陽事變之後。民族感情已處於絶對相反地位。惟其如此。吾人對於日本有關各事。更當特别留心研究。先作到知已知彼地步。夫日本上自政府下至人民。皆爲軍部所支配。所謂非常時期之緊張情勢。已遍布於日本全國。而社會之動摇。人心之不安。反以非常時期之過度伸張。而愈呈現其不寗之狀。於是所謂充實軍備也。擴張海軍也。五相會議也。預算問昰貤。莫不顯示齋藤内閣之弱點。與日本整個國家之不安定。增加軍費。因須擴大國庫預算。於日本國力更發生重大之影響。吾人就事實體察。從客觀分晰。無論日本軍國主義者如何猛進。但其天産物非常澆薄。即以鐵鑛論。日本全國所産。僅足供其製鋼能力十分之一。石油亦然。而其所謂重工業。非特不能與英美德諸先進國並立。即較之法比。尚有遜色。且其國内農業恐慌日甚。尤足以影響全國。自一九二九年世界經濟恐慌發生以後。日本之經濟危機。遍被各地。無論鄕村城市。皆呻吟於不景氣之苦痛中徒因其有較爲强力之政府。與以軍事關係挑動非常時期。始能掩蔽其國内恐慌之事實耳。</p>
<p>頃者彼日當局亦已知長此以往之非計。農村破産之暴露。足使全國陷於悲境。而危險思想之潛伏。尤足增加日本社會之不安。軍部統制。勢將益感困難。是以日本内政會議。由農林大臣後藤文夫提出振興農村之具體方案。其中最重要者。在「改」革農村敎育。培養領導農村之中心人物。重賞農村之模範團體。」於其將來國内之眞實效能何如。姑置不論。惟吾人　於此。尚有連帶之感想焉。</p>
<p>第一我國之敎育。數十年來亦不少專心向學努力從事之士。然效力則至今未見。即辦敎育之負責者。亦不免於自歎前途之渺茫。其故何耶。吾人觀察。以爲中國素來以農立國。迄今工商業雖相當向上發達。但就整個情形論。則仍不脫農業國之形態。而一般敎育之於農村。則絶鮮關係。故已受完全敎育之人。即已與農村關係。完全脫離。甚至受中等敎育者。亦不願再回鄕村。從事農業。縱令有之。亦以少數人之努力。於整個農村不生影響。以故我國農村。直無所謂敎育。今欲改革。及時自勉。惟有創設農村敎育。并使敎育適應農村之需求。始漸能有望。</p>
<p>第二。我國農村。因外來經濟勢力之剥削。與資本主義國家相較。愈見衰頽影象。而農村中之政治組織與經濟週轉。又多操諸土豪劣紳之手。品性稍見正當之人。每不能立足於今日之鄕村。是則領導農村之中心人物。在我中國較日本尤爲急需。一時苟不能即得。亦須勤加培植。希冀後來之收穫。至於奬掖農村中之模範團體。更待從事農業者自動組織。與地方政治之提携也。</p>
<p>我國農村。憊敝已甚。無論爲敎育之改革。爲政治之整理。皆不易談。是以根本救治農村之道。不宜捨本逐末。祗求上層敎育之建設。而必須先自收善農民生活。增加農業生産。提高農産物價格入手。同時尤須掃除政治上之障礙。消除黃捐雜稅。并不使高利盤剥。爲害於民。則農村之復興。其庶幾矣。</p>

<h3>孔祥熙來滬談　財部整頓田賦　擬在四中全會提出　徵遺産稅在計劃中</h3>
<p>財政部長孔祥熙、昨晨七時三十分、由京乘夜車抵滬、下車後逕返西愛咸斯路私邸休息、十一時接見各報社記者發表談話、兹分誌如下、</p>
<h3>財部提案整頓田賦</h3>
<p>孔氏循記者之問、首稱此次四中全會、本人將代表財政部、有一整頓田賦之提案、蓋各省田賦複雜、令人難以言述、有田少而賦重者有田多而賦輕者、甚至有田而無賦者、自裁厘後、各省因少一財政來源、於是乃從土百姓（農民）身上着想、巧立種種名目、爰取償於田賦、據本人最近調查、各省征收之法雖異、然其苛征之目的則同、如省方征之、縣方征之、地方復之、甚至駐軍亦征之、有所謂「敎育附加」、「保衛附加」等項、其名目多至三十餘種、尤以四川一隅、聞田賦已征至民國五十餘年以上、如此層層苛征、致農村破産、民不聊生、農民終年勞苦、尚不堪一飽、於是挺而走險、土匪蠭起、田賦原歸財部職掌、爲剔除積弊、藉資救濟、使農民稍舒喘息、故特在此次全會提出整頓田賦一案、喚起全體中委之注意、共商整頓辦法、</p>
<h3>四中全會展期原因</h3>
<p>孔氏又謂、中央此次推派張繼·馬超俊·陳肇英·王陸一·四同志南下、其任務爲敦促西南各中委入京出席四中全會、惟四中全會、原定十二月二十日在京召集、兹以會期已近、前往廣州敦促西南中委來京之張委員等、現方到粤、諸中委勢難期前趕到、故决展期一個月、以便各中委得以從容來京出席、外傳四中全會展期開會、係待張繼等各同志返京報告之說、實非確詞、至於胡展堂同志能否來京、目前尚無所聞、</p>
<h3>開放政權須經訓政</h3>
<p>港電、傳蔣委員長有電致西南、表示贊同開放政權之說、記者當以是叩諸孔氏、據謂國民黨之「國民」二字、即係國民的黨意思、凡屬國民均可加入、入黨以後、經訓政時期、即得有選舉權及被選舉權、國民黨在訓政工作、未能澈底辦竣以前、爲國家着想、爲民族着想、實不容立卸責任、必俟訓政工作完了、國民有制憲法能力後、方得結束訓政時期、而開始實行憲政、現言「開放政權」實時尚未至、如欲得有政權、祇要不背黨義、堅决奉行總理遺敎而加入國民黨、隨時即得有政權、且論過去與現在、非國民黨員而得政權者、亦比比皆是、如政府各部長以及各委員會委員、多有並非國民黨員者、此則可謂國民黨並未嘗眞實行所謂「專政」、而早予黨外之人以政權矣、</p>
<h3>徵遺産稅在計劃中</h3>
<p>財部對於徵收遺産稅、目前尚在計劃之中、至於洋米麥之進口稅、則决定自十六日起實行徵收、惟粤桂等省、向爲食米口岸、民食均仰給於洋米洋麥同時各該省當局、對於洋米洋麥、亦已徵收營業稅、每擔一元、故决定曁免徵收、以維民食、至徵收洋米麥進口稅之唯一目的、原爲保護國産米麥、故設若將來有某一省所産之米麥不夠民食、則自亦當免征洋米麥進口稅、以作補救也、</p>
<h3>航校美敎練　戴樂受傷來滬就醫　前晚六時半敎夜航失事　當夜由汽車送宏恩醫院</h3>
<p>大陸報云、寛橋中央航空學校美敎練戴樂昨（十四）晚在寛橋飛機場飛行受傷、除傷及右頰骨與顎骨外、並喪失牙齒六枚、當於昨夜十一時許田同事桑斯堡以汽車運送抵滬、入宏恩醫院醫治、聞昨晚出事時、係在六時三十分、戴樂偕一中國學員駕駛練習機、敎以夜航之術、不幸降落時、陡然着地、其餘勢竟使戴氏撞及機身、致傷頰部、其同乘學員則未受傷、飛機亦無恙、迨本埠潘萊夫人接桑斯堡長途電話、乃預邀醫生及牙醫、迨戴樂抵醫院、立爲施治云、</p>

<h3>演詞彚誌</h3>
<p>主席報各畢、旋由國際貿易局長何炳賢演說、略謂、今日中國商業衰落、一切經濟組織、均瀕於破産時期、其主要原因、就是入紹之數日增、輪出之數日少、在目前補救方法、惟有國人努力提倡國貨、各工廠改良出品、使國人樂於購用國貨、則外貨自然减少、庶可挽回於萬一云云、繼由社會局長代表吳桓如演說、近來外貨充斥、中國市塲盡力傾銷、致中國商業一蹶不振、此係中國貧窮之一因、再自東北四省失陷後、我國出口貨更見少、而入口貨日見多、其漏巵實堪驚人、若不設法補救、前途不堪設想、本人曾見日本愛用國貨之熱、非常欽佩、良以人民抱定不用外國貨、盡量購用本國貨、我深望國人效法云、尚有王延松林康候等相繼演說、語多警恊、詞長從略、</p>

<h3>洋酒科貼印花　華洋商應一律待遇　機聯會呈財部請察核施行</h3>
<p>本市機製國貨工廠聯合會、以洋酒及酒精印花稅、華洋未能一致、國貨廠商、受累不堪、昨特呈請財政部同樣待遇、原呈云、呈爲華人仿洋酒及酒精稅、請與外人一般待遇事、謹按民國十八年六月、財政部洋酒類稅暫行章程第一條内開、凡在本國境内銷售洋酒類、均須按照本章程之規定、依率納稅、其第二項云、前項洋酒類、無論外人製造、華人仿造、及舶來品均屬之、現在上寶烟酒稅稽徵分局、對於華人仿造洋酒、均須按瓶科貼印花、而對舶來品、則以關稅自主而後、洋酒進口稅率、已經增高、故按一物不兩稅之原則、不再科貼印花、其實市上盛消之白蘭地洋酒、</p>
<h3>外人大都取巧</h3>
<p>桶裝原料來華、屬水裝瓶出售、按諸現行進口稅率、桶裝洋酒、係照價微收百分之五十、雖不知估價如何、但以同在三百七十八欵之瓶裝稅率、每箱十二充瓜脫、卽十二瓶、抽稅、不過關金一元三角、每瓶約合國幣二角之譜、而在江蘇印花稅處所定之上海華洋機製酒類印花稅率表列、瓶裝蘭地酒、每瓶貼印花六角五分、然則關稅縱已增高、尚不及於原科印花稅率三分之一、而在洋商舶來品、則已免貼印花、獨對華人仿造洋酒、仍須科帖印花、是不啻爲叢敺爵、又不啻爲洋酒保障推銷、蓋由洋酒以桶裝洋酒報關進口、完納值百抽五十之稅後、羼水裝瓶、含酒不過一半、不啻僅納百分之二十五之稅、而在華商購入桶裝洋酒羼水裝瓶出售、除完抽百抽五十之原料進口稅外、又須科以值百值三十之印花稅、以含水一半計、是不啻值百抽一百十矣、此於瓶酒類之稽徵辦法、華洋不平等者一也、又查洋酒類稅暫行章程第三條之規定、關於火酒一項、每百斤微稅二十元、此係十八年六月所訂、與江蘇印花稅處特種印花稅表所列第三百四十一欵、火酒酒精部、定每百斤科貼印花二十元、每英介侖科貼印花一元五角相同、其時進口關稅、僅值百抽五、每介侖抽稅不過國幣四分、關稅自主而後、逐步增高、至本年五月二十二日修正止、純凈火酒、每介侖連附稅抽關金四角五分六釐、約合國幣九角一分、比較從前關稅已增至二十二倍有奇、雖於有毒變性之火酒、約减半稅、但亦微至國幣四角六分之譜、比從前亦增十倍以上、洋商所用火酒、則因廠設租界、除完進口稅外、卽無科貼印花之可能、而在華商所用火酒、則凡廠設華界中者、除完同樣之關稅外、又須科貼印花、例如西藥業用爲浸劑、五金業用以製凡立水、化裝品業用於花露水等、凡由洋商在租界設廠所製者、使用火酒每介侖僅納關稅九角一分、而在華商設廠於華界所製者、則每介侖除納關稅九角一分之外、又須另科印花稅一元五角、姑不論其價值如何、卽此負擔之稅、已屬懸殊、同一貨品、洋商可以九角一分出貨、而華商非售二元四角一分不可、豈非</p>
<h3>明絶華商之路</h3>
<p>轉爲洋商之保障、是直爲淵敺魚、將使華界之中、無設白廠之餘地、此於火酒一項之稽徵辦法、華洋不平等者二也、總上二例、足見稽徵局之辦理手續、似有誤會、竊查煙酒稅史、内載洋酒類稅創自蘇省、係於民國十四年、由江蘇烟酒維持會理事呈請、以中國土酒、自民國四年開辦公賣以來、稅率已達百分之六七十、洋酒除納極輕之海關稅外、並無其他稅項、因之土酒日漸淘汰、國計民生兩被其害、爰請籌徵洋酒稅、以均負擔、並以奸商購用火酒攙水冒充燒酒、爰請科貼印花重稅寓禁於徵、自民國十五年以來、徵收機關、雖屬屢有變遷、但無論爲委員官辦、或包商認辦、莫不保護華商之營業、抵制洋酒之傾銷、爲唯一之目的、從未有如現在上寶烟酒稅稽微分局之專對華商科貼印花、而在租界之洋商、反得莫可與京之便宜、似此情形、將來華界工廠、</p>
<h3>非遷租界不可</h3>
<p>天下事之不平等殆無過於此者、會員工廠、同無辦法、欲求最後之解决是以來會磋商、請卽由會備文呈請鈞部俯賜解决、辦法如下、（一）洋酒類稅暫行章程第一條第二項原文、無論外人製造華人仿造及舶來品均屬之、現在市上銷售之舶來品洋酒、旣因關稅加重、依一物不兩稅之原則、可以不再科貼印花則凡華人仿造之洋酒、購進桶袋原料、改裝瓶者、應請准其提出已納關稅憑證、一律待遇、不再科貼印花、如無已納同稅之憑證、係在國内製造出售、則華洋一律應貼印花、庶稽徵局之權責分明、不致反替外人排斥國貨、（二）同章第三條之稅率、係在民國十八年所定、現在關稅旣已增加、舶來品已微關稅、免貼印花、當然除外、是原指在中國境内製售者言、因其未經完過關稅、卽無證明文件稽徵、自當照章科稅、以杜偷漏取巧、蓋依現行進口稅則第三八一及三八四欵、本須從價徵收值百抽五十之多、今依洋酒類稅第三條之規定祇須值百抽三十、卽不啻因其廠設在華、僱用國工、得挽外溢利權、故予便利、至於火酒一項、則新關稅已經增訂爲每英介侖徵收關金四角五分六厘、約合</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>國幣九角一分、若在國内製售、依洋酒類稅第三條規定、每百斤微收二十元、等於每介侖一元五角、相差至半倍以上、將使國内應用火酒、决無在國内製售之餘地、非購舶來品不可、是則此條規定、徒爲舶來品推廣銷路而已、擬請察核上述情形、减爲每一百公斤徵稅二十元、或每英介侖徵稅九角一分、庶在國内始有實現製造之可能、若係購用舶來品之火酒、已完過關稅者、應請准其提出憑證、</p>
<h3>華洋一筆待遇</h3>
<p>不再科貼印花、上述二點、是否合當、乞賜批令祗遵、以便持批赴局接洽、而安營業、若恐火酒充作燒酒、則行政院令第十三號、已經取締在案、有干刑章、而且土燒現價每百斤不過七元、約合每介侖六角三分、而火酒關稅須徵九角一分、加以酒價、不但無利可圖、且須貼本、是在根本上已成不可能之事實、而在寓禁於徵之本意、亦已貫澈初衷、而無偏弊、伏乞鈞部察核施行、實爲公便、</p>

<h3>請求免稅</h3>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>說批評</h3>
<p>— 林微音</p>
<p>杜衡先生近日看到了一張文藝漫盡：畫着一個孩子在撕書而她鋗是：他將成爲一個批評家，便有所感慨。而寫了一篇關於批評的文章。只是，那位漫南家的意見是有商量的餘地的，因爲孩子撕書，不一定爲了它的内容壞才斯，正如他摔碗，也許正爲了那碗可愛，摔來又清朡可聽，才摔一樣。那撕書，把以，未見得就是那孩子將成爲一個批評家的先兆。</p>
<p>雖然，我也想說一說批評。</p>
<p>批評在現在一般地被認爲是一種復仇的工具。往往有人看到了關於他的作品的批評，所最先注意到的並不是那批評，而是那批評者。要是那批評者是他所認識的，他就會追思，看他在什麽地方得罪過他；要是他想不出有什麽得罪過他的地方，他就會不明白他爲什麽要批評他的作品。可是，最後，他是大都能找得一個理由的，如投稿不取，借錢不遂之類。他便把那理由說出來，以證明那批評意思只在報私仇，而彷彿說那於他的作品是無損的。</p>
<p>要是作者並不認識而只知道那批評者，他就趕速望望那批評者的後面有没有他的羣，或者看他的批評究竟有什麽作用；待他以爲看清楚了，他便可回讀者指點說，别上那批評者的當，他是有他的羣，或者他的批評是有什麽作用的。要是那批評者的署名是陌生的，授批評者便或者假定地以爲那是誰的化名，而對準着那隱在那化名後的人反攻，或者就置之不理，意思說那批評是没有理的價值。</p>
<p>因爲批評祇被看做報私仇之類，對於批評的回答很容易地流於人身攻擊。被批評者不說批評者的批評是怎樣，只能批評者的人是怎樣。要是他知道他是長了一根白髮，或者失過一次眠，或者，甚至，他的父親是一個抽鴉片的人，他便向那一點進攻着，藉以證明他不配批評他的作品。</p>
<p>其實批評只是批評，爲什麽不就批評本身求是非？難道批評眞只能做復仇的工具嗎？而且卽使在批評者與被批評者之間的確有過什麽私仇，而批評者做那批評的動機的確是在報復，要是那批評是貼切的批評，被批評者就可說批評者志在什麽而置那批評於不顧？不顧了，就可掩飾他的作品的被指出了的謬誤？要是批評得不對，他儘可說出它的不對的所以，不對在那里，也不必去注意對方的頭髮有没有白，或者有没有被退過稿。</p>
<p>批評祇是批評，是無須牽涉到什麽别的事情上去的。</p>
<h3>我底悒鬱</h3>
<p>— 靳以</p>
<p>獨自倚在車箱之中，茫茫然地隨了列車把我帶到任何地方去，而我底心是不會有着落，如影子一樣地隨了我的，則是我的悒鬱。</p>
<p>但是我并不抱怨，因爲它是那麽忠實。</p>
<p>車輪在磨擦鐵軌的聲音，像是要攪亂了我的神經，我便放下窗子來；可是還有那音響，雖輕微，落在我的心上也是那麽着重。我繼續讀着已經看過一大半的一本友人所譯的小說，寫着兩個拾得的孩子相遇的故事。把這書讀完，我的眼睛濕潤着，我想有那機會給我痛快快地哭一場；可是我没有能那樣做，因爲我知道坐在對面的人在注視着我的眼睛。</p>
<p>「那裏是我所要去的地方呢？」</p>
<p>我自已這樣問着了。我只能垂了頭，等候着列車進了站，在一羣人之中，我無目的地走着，我到了我底家，我底家成爲那麽冷清。</p>
<p>雖然已經黑下來，我還是走出去，我拉起大衣的領子，冒了秋晚的寒凉，踽踽地行着。</p>
<p>等到我回到我的家時，是午夜後的兩點鐘了。</p>
<p>那晚上一個舊日的相識，偶然間在友人的家中遇到，於是，告訴了我那麽許多話，她的身子在抖着，說出許多的追悔與希望；那麽倔强的一個女人，成爲如此柔弱的了。</p>
<p>把世事看得淡極了的我呵，告訴着我是老了起來，没有一點用；可是走回來時，却爲她那該憐憫的樣子起了同情之感。我底悒鬱更濃厚了，我知道了這世界上多出一個人來在忍受。甚至於我痛恨自已。爲了人道的理由，我不該把冷笑來應着她的叙述的。她駡着我，想起來也并不過分；因爲我是那麽木然，如衰敗的斷草。</p>
<p>現在我　得笑，可是有時候我的笑却使人那麽不高興，這一次她也說過：「你不能停一停麽？你知道我是這麽樣Ｎervous。」我看到她的身子抖，抖得那麽可怕，雖然知道也許她的心中起了什麽樣的變化，但是我故意說到天氣。　　「你覺得冷的？」</p>
<p>「是，不可耐的寒冷呵。」</p>
<p>「我也是」我笑了笑，「不然我就可以把外衣脫給你穿。」</p>
<p>「你是冷！」</p>
<p>她把這個「冷」字說得那麽重，我知道她的心意，但是最多我也只能和她如朋友一樣地握看手而已。</p>
<p>若是有拯救人的心願，我自已該是第一個被拯救的吧！</p>
<p>於是她凄然地說着：</p>
<p>「記着我一點吧，如友人一樣地，我知道你是一個好男人，我願意你永遠是一個好男人！」</p>
<p>她轉過身去走了，在黑夜之中，她那黑的身形很快地就看不出來了。</p>
<p>我回到我底家，我後悔着不該看到她或是没有能　她所要的。</p>
<p>我知道我是老了，可是我底悒鬱却是那麽年青，那麽健壯地壓在我的心上。</p>
<h3>茶亭裏</h3>
<p>— 彭成慧</p>
<p>是六月天，太陽火似的在地上燃燒。</p>
<p>没有一點兒清風，雖然是在這濃郁的山上。高大的松樹，矮小的叢林；在猛烈的陽光下，靜靜地彷彿也在喘氣。周圍非常沉寂，只有鷓鴣很噪耳的在山谷裏呌着，泉水很清幽的在石崖下凈淙。爲了天氣太炎熱，所以過路的人很少，連擔鹹魚的，擔疋頭的，擔苧蔴的，也不多見，雖說這條道路是從楓樹寨到河田墟必經的山徑。</p>
<p>就在這僻靜的山徑裏有着一座茶亭。這茶亭很小，只有一個正廳，没有房間，也没有門户。裏面除了幾條石凳以外，就只有些牛屎粕，乾柴灰一類的點綴品。正中的墻壁上是安旅亭」三個大字。兩片運有一副砌成的對聯：右的是「爲名忙，爲利忙，忙裏偷閒，喝杯茶去。」左的是爲衣苦，爲食苦，苦中作樂，拿壺洒來。」大約這茶亭有很長久的歷史，經過多年風雨的吹打，經過多年霜雪的侵蝕，所以已顯得很蒼古殘破了。</p>
<p>祖母，年紀很老的。皮膚皺得像柑皮，身體彎得像把弓；老態龍鍾，偏傴僂僂的，終日老是坐在這座茶亭裏打盹。她的面前，擺着一張用木板架成的檯子，上面擺着十來包雲片糕，三四筒小餅，幾碗清茶，還有十幾隻沙梨。這些等待着過客光顧的食品，便是她不論天晴落雨，每天守在這裏的目的了。</p>
<p>我們的家就是建築在前面山腰裏的幾座泥屋。那邊，疎疎落落，只有十幾家住户。此刻大約還没有燒飯，屋頂上還不見有炊烟升起。自已跟小球剛剛在山上放牛回來，肚皮餓得很利害。看見祖母面前那些東西，就覺得口涎像泉水一般的往上湧。雪白的雲片糕，圓圓的大餅，黃黃的沙梨，似乎有極大的吸引力，兩隻眼睛便不住的在那上面打轉，幾乎全數有多少都　我算清楚了。</p>
<p>「婆！幾　吃一隻！」最　我終於　不住的開口。</p>
<p>「吃什麽？」她像有點　　，　大了兩隻老眼。</p>
<p>「沙梨！」</p>
<p>「不！這是要本錢買來的。」</p>
<p>「一隻有什應要緊呢！」</p>
<p>「一隻也得要七八個銅子」</p>
<p>「我現在肚皮餓煞啦！」</p>
<p>「家裏就燒飯了，回家去吃飯吧！」</p>
<p>「家裏到現在還没有燒飯呢！你看，屋頂上還没有起烟。」</p>
<p>祖母雖然很堅决的不願給我吃，然而自已却總不聽話，老是嚕嚕囌囌的在她旁邊糾纒。彷彿她的年紀很老，很可欺負似的，總會答應我的要求，卽使給她駡幾句，也不放在心上。她站起來，重新將那些使我垂涎的東西擺了一番，她的用意，好像提防我會自動伸手去搶似的。聽見我說家裏還没有起烟，她眞的抬起頭來，睜着朦朧的眼睛向前面遥望。</p>
<p>「大約總快要燒飯了。」她慢吞吞的解釋了一句。</p>
<p>「不，我要吃一隻！我要吃一隻，肚皮要餓穿啦！」我嘩啦嘩啦的要求，彷彿非達到目的不可。</p>
<p>「眞頑皮！呌你不要吃却一定要吃，那末揀一隻小點的，生蟲的去吧！」她像不勝其煩似的，没有法子，終於答應了。</p>
<p>我馬上笑着伸手取了一個。不特不是最小的，生蟲的，而且是最大的，又圓，又黃。香氣隨卽透進我的鼻孔。</p>
<p>「小球，我們到後面山溝裏摩坑螺去，回來吃午飯。」我咬了一口梨子向小球說。</p>
<p>「好，去！」小球看見我有梨子吃，也就眉飛色舞，彷彿他也有得分潤，很高與的從石板上跳下來。</p>
<p>「淘氣的傢伙！自已吃也要這樣大隻的！…」我　見祖母不斷地　　萎埋怨，然而我却不理她，頭也不回的跟小球跳着向茶　後面的山裏去了。</p>
<h3>文藝雜談</h3>
<p>— 夢原</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>僕僕於滬杭道中的孫福熙先生，最近又到蘇州作「人生的樂趣」的講演，其講演詞載在二卷五期的「文藝茶話」中。孫先生講了人生的樂趣，第一是互助，第二是博愛以後，又用眼前的實事證明道：</p>
<p>現在，東北四省的失陷，於中國是極大的恥辱，我們必須盡力的去爭回來，然而（文勢至此一轉！夢註），這不是終日痛哭流涕所能辦到，我們正應該快樂的增長我們的學問技能，與仇人比勝（此所謂各安本業的救國論也！夢又註）。好比一個同學侮辱我一下，我不必照樣地侮辱他報復，除了與他理論之外（此理論非吃講茶也！夢三註」，還要自已格外用功（譬如孫先生不聽大砲，專書菊花！夢四註），這也是一種報復的方法，這裏面含有重大的人生的趣味（也可以說是政治意味！夢五註）。</p>
<p>孫先生的救國哲學，於此可見，可惜這種哲學，没有一個總名，頗是美中不足。我很想替它起個「茶話救國論」的名字，擁護這種主張的人，就呌做「茶話救國派」，不知道亦有當否？自古以來，「清談」雖一再誤國，此「茶話」，在本質上，並不同於「清談」，我想絶對不會引起各方面的誤會也。</p>
<h3>兩兄弟（六○）</h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑著　李維克譯</p>
<p>他們現在直立在那有着鹽質的水窪裏，水浸到腿腹，兩手水滴滴地擱在蝦網上，他們四目相注地對瞧着。</p>
<p>她以一種說笑的辯駁的語氣說：</p>
<p>「你揀着這個時候來和我談這事眞也想得太好了呀！雖道你就不能等到别的時候來說，免得妨害我捕蝦嗎？」</p>
<p>他喃喃地說：</p>
<p>「對不起，可是我再不能夠忍住不說了。我好久以來就愛了你。今天你更把我弄醉了，使我失去了理性。」</p>
<p>於是，突然。她像逆來順受似的，放棄了捕蝦的樂趣，勉强來談論正經事情。</p>
<p>「我們坐在道礁石上罷，」她說，「我們可以安安然然地來談」。</p>
<p>他們爬上那稍高和岩石，當他們在那上面並排坐好了，滿身曬着太陽，兩脚垂着時，她再開口道：</p>
<p>「親愛的朋友，你已不是一個孩子，而我也不是一個少女。我們彼此都明白這是什麽事情，並目我們可以考慮我們行動的一切結果。你今天旣然决定對我宣佈你的愛情，那我自然猜想你是要娶我。」</p>
<p>他毫没有料到會有這番明確的陳述，他儍腦地回答道：</p>
<p>「自然啦。」</p>
<p>「你曾同你的父親和母親說過這事嗎？」</p>
<p>「没有。我想先知道你肯不肯。」</p>
<p>她把她那還没有乾的手伸給他，他連忙把他的手合上去，她便說道：</p>
<p>「我呢，是很願意的。我相信你善良而又誠篤。不過你得記住我不願使得你的雙親不樂。」</p>
<p>「啊！你以爲我的母親毫没有預料到嗎？假如她不希望我們結婚的話，她會像她現在那樣的愛你嗎？」</p>
<p>「這話不錯，我對於她的她意是有點兒惶惑的。」</p>

<h3>銀價與中國物價水準之關係</h3>
<p>（二續）路易士　張履鸞作</p>
<p>若以一九一○至一九一四年爲基期、那末中國輪入的物品數量在一八八七年爲四一·二、在一九三○年爲一八六·八、似永在繼續增加中、但在另一方面看、自一九二三至一九三一的十年中、白銀的購買力的低降、在歷史上無與其匹、然而中國的人口數、反特别增高、自一九三一年五月以後、中國物價水準開始下降、而入口貨之指數、亦由一八六·八而降至一六○·八、在一九三二年、僅爲一三六·○、可知中國購買力之大小、與銀價高低却成反比、惟一九三二年指數東三省方面、係屬大致估計者、</p>
<p>在金本位國家中、物價自一九二九年起、卽開始下降商業亦於無形逐漸衰落、不論外國貨或其本國所産的物品、交易皆極形消沉、在中國方面、物價之低、已足使農民感受尖銳之困厄、若再繼續卜降、則目下之工資率勢必不能　續保持、失業者更衆、而各種合作公司或銀行等、亦恐將受其害、且目下之農産物價、農民已感受還債付稅的困難、蓋中國爲農業國、物價低落時、鄕村物價每較其他爲甚故在中國而遭物價低落、對於農村經濟方面的摧殘、反較城市爲大、與其他各國情形絶不相同、所以减低外貨購買力在中國方面購、實僅爲銀價增高後所發生種種困難危險中之一種最小的表現、（未完）</p>
<h3>證劵多空互持下之債市　買賣難覓對手　市價稍覺畸形</h3>

<h3>紐約股市略高</h3>
<p>新豐洋行十四日報告云、紐約股市大致略高、惟極呆滯蓋年底在卽、交易者皆審愼從事、金礦股漲起最多、由於美元疲萎、及倫敦與善後公司之金價漸趨接近、烟草股因十一月份捲烟之産銷减少略跌、美國公債參差、外國公債較堅、投機者對市塲情形大都認爲滿意咸信市場已顯其抵抗壓力之能力云、全日成交一百五十六萬股、（小麥）市况略低、（棉花）市况呆滯、脚地平定、大概仍將隨金價上落、金融善後社收買黃金每兩價格爲三四·○一元、不動、兹將道瓊斯指數列後、</p>

<p>本年各省棉田面積、河北山西河南陜西湖北江蘇等省均增、尤以河北山西陜西湖北江蘇增加最多、冀省平漢路線植棉日見發展、尤多洋棉、山西年來以地方較靖、棉産復興、豫陜以戰亂不作、榖價又賤、棉田遂多湖北江蘇自二十年大水爲災棉田大减、近年恢復甚速、他省亦逐年進步、因此棉田總額、數年以來、與時併進、本年北方春夏之間、得雨甚豐、棉作均能及時播穩、此爲本年北省棉田激增之一大原因、惟山東一省稍减、秋間又以黃河水災淹田不少、幸退水尚速、未盡失收、故本年全國棉田面積、在第一次估計時已達三千九百十五萬畝、因本年第一次調查較早、故第二次又增至三千九百六十八畝、此次估計更超出四千萬畝、爲最近十五年間之最高數字、故就全國棉田面積言、堪稱進步也、此次估計、已可視爲最後實收數量、以九百六十二萬一千二百四十担計、比較二十一年增加一百五十一萬五千六百零三担、比較二十年更增至三百二十二萬一千四百六十担、産量之多、不特爲近年所未有、且爲自民八以降之最大産數、惟棉産之增加、初非收成之豐、　爲棉田面積增多之故、蓋本年棉田、亦爲民後以八之最高數也、以言收成、不過中稔、（按棉田增加、以北方爲多、因兵匪之亂稍靖、農民差稱苟安、益以天氣良好、得雨甚足、棉田遂增、）第一次估計之平均每畝收量二七·二斤、爲自民八以後之最大數、故彼時對於今年棉收、頗有豐稔希　、至第二次估計時、則至已减爲二四·八斤、此次估計、又降爲二三·八斤、比較二十一年最後實收之二一·八斤高二斤、而適與自民八以降十四年之平均數相同、（十四年間總數每畝二三·八斤）</p>

<p>西青籃球昨晚華隊俱失利、南星大敗於麥令五十八比十六、麥令斯有北平調來之中鋒樂克、身體雖牛似一隻、然行動之快實令人佩服、昨晚獨得二十四分、尚僅一半時間也、該隊現頗有打敗海賊而稱覇之可能、昨乙組二塲、划船三十九比十九勝法軍、俄僑四十七比三十四勝東吳、今日下午二時起共四場乙組三場甲組、兹將昨賽情形及今日秩序錄後、</p>
<p>麥令勝南星（甲）二分鐘内被麥令樂克茂萊投入、八分後、南星張大奇力還敬一球、瞬息麥令復激增至十七分、乃另易全班人馬上場、大約屬次一等脚色、然仍十分兇犯、上半時以念一對四、大占勝、南星望塵莫及、下半時麥令又以第一批球員應戰、張大奇包新弟曾一度各獲一球、似漸有活氣、迨成四十九比十五時、麥令又交換以五十八比十六終場、</p>
<p>俄僑勝東吳（乙）俄僑人强馬壯、首先中籃後、東吳曾一度六比二領前、迨對方加緊工作、卽不復繼、始終以數分依人籬下、最後俄僑以四十七比三十四勝利、</p>

<h3>吳瞿安的學文管見</h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>瞿安先生爲近代的詞曲專家，於中國文學深有研究，並且是一位老敎授，他初坐臯比時，年紀很輕，到現在已在三十多年的敎授經騐了。前天到東吳大學文學會裏來演講，我爲了有些事情，不能終席，只聽見他講的「學文管見」第一節對偶，他說對偶是人們的習慣，譬如說一句話，都得引上一個例子，不夠再添上一個，這就是對偶的起源。</p>
<p>後來我的朋友告訴我，下面還講三節，第二節是禮記，讀了書以後，應當把心得寫出來。第三節是讀文章，說文章不可不讀，並且不可不熱，不讀便不熟，要熱非讀不可，現在大多數是不讀的，不能稱讀書人，只能稱看書人了。第四節是識别字，說别字說出來非嘗剌耳，使人聽了，便感到其人的不學。這四點雖是老生常談，却很切實，不像那些海闊天空的演說家，只在博得聽衆的鼓掌，數了以後，一無所得。</p>
<p>我以爲就中以第四節最有意味，而社會習慣更其可笑。像廬山的廬字，明明音閭，而上海人偏偏讀作盧。龔定厂的龔，明明音恭，而蘇州人偏讀作炯字的平聲。不過比較的，上海人讀别的多些，像軍樂隊的樂字，讀作洛。娱樂的娱字，讀作誤。先前有一家菜館呌倚虹樓，他們把倚字讀作奇字，但是小說家畢倚虹，却没有人喚他奇虹了。</p>
<p>尤其不可思議，是把美麗川菜館五個字，分成美麗川和菜館兩橛了。</p>
<h3>國際外交逸話</h3>
<p>— 小鶯</p>
<p>如是我聞：在外交的幕前幕後，曾有若干含有趣味的一鱗半爪，有的被時人所忽略，有的爲外間所不知，雖然無關宏旨，可是事後談論却仍不失其趣味的性質，選輯於此，藉博一粲。</p>
<p>九一八事變的時候，據說我外交部一時尚難獲確實的情報，所以當外國通訊社記者前往探詢新聞時，竟没有具體的答覆。</p>
<p>遠東風雲緊張時，華盛頓國務院成爲國際政治的重心。有一次，我公使施施旋基正在和史汀生晤談，日大使出淵適不速而至，聰明的美國外交門吏，一方面邀出淵於别室，一方面并將施使衣帽携出，伺候門旁，避免兩國外交代表相見時的麻煩。</p>
<p>國聯討論東北問題時，日代表芳澤突然聲明用日語演說，一時報紙喧傳，芳澤氏不善法文；但據熟悉内幕者談，芳澤氏並非不諳法語，而重勞舌人轉譯者，蓋凖備演辭上果有修改時，預作放賴的地步而已。</p>
<p>英國外交，素以紳士態度見稱於世；但是，當海牙討論德國賠欵問題，史諾登却用極蠢的話駡法國代表，因爲此公本非外交人才，而且時勢緊迫，所以急不擇言。</p>
<h3>片感</h3>
<p>— 鶴山</p>
<p>糖炒栗子；當然很好吃的，我也愛吃。</p>
<p>今天清早，大概九點鐘吧？一路電車裏上來了兩位摩登大姐。才坐下來，就打開一紙包糖炒栗子大吃起來。用伊那鮮紅的指甲，剥了栗殼，一個一個向那血盆大口裏納進去。帶吃帶談笑，正吃得高興的當兒，旁邊一個外國老太，即板了面孔說道：ＴhisisFirstClass·ＰleaseDon't！這兩個小姐却嘻皮笑臉，也打着洋話回這ＡllRight頓將紙包收拾了，很不在意的依舊談笑。電車到了外灘，那外國老太下車去了，這兩位小姐却又大吃起來，把栗殼撒了個滿地。</p>
<p>這小小一件偶然的事，使我起了幾個疑問：一，假使這兩位小姐是外國蜜司，不知這位外國老太要不要照樣干涉，一，電車裏常見的告白不外是禁止吐痰，禁止吸烟，禁止拉鈴，議防手和檢查月季票規則幾塊木牌，却從未見過禁止吃糖炒栗子的佈告，這位老太不知根據那一條有權干涉，一，老太說這是頭等，我却不知頭等與三等除了車資不同外，還有什麽兩樣。</p>
<p>可也不能責人太重，責已太輕，糖炒栗子雖然人人愛吃，這兩位小姐，大清早晨，才吃過早飯，（大概總已吃過），就吃糖炒栗子，恐怕也不衛生，就是要吃，何必定要在電車裏吃，旣經勸告不吃，老太走後，爲何又做出這種醜態？眞令人不解。</p>
<p>電車裏抛棄果殼，本是一個不公德問題。我們貴國人的公德，老實說，是不大好，外國老太干涉中國小姐吃糖炒栗子，本無不可，不過以疾言厲色相侍在國際禮讓上，似乎說不過去吧？</p>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>

<p>第二十回　卜吉有期老人連日笑　剷愁不盡舊雨對門居</p>
<p>江氏道：請到屋子裏坐坐罷。趙翁嘻嘻的笑着，走進屋子來，他手上没有旱烟袋桿了，空了兩手，只管將巴掌互相挪搓着。桂枝半蓬了頭髮，在靠門的一張方凳子上，半斜了身子坐着，臉黃黃的，分明是帶着病容了。他看見趙翁進來。站起身來，低低的呌了一聲老太爺，靠門站着，並没有移動。趙翁道：我聽說你招了凉了，現在還没有好嗎？桂枝帶着微笑。露出兩排白牙來，低聲柔氣道：這就好的多呢，躺下了兩天了。老太爺旱烟袋呢，不抽烟嗎？趙翁剛剛要在一張椅子上坐下去，聽了這話，復又站了起來，左手摸鬍子，右手伸了一個食指，指點着桂枝笑這：都是爲了你們的事，把我樂大發了。你母親一說呌自强回來完婚，我喜從心起，不由得拍掌呌一聲好，這旱烟袋跟着起哄，也往地下一頓脚。它這一頓脚不要緊，閙了個倒栽葱，把咀子打碎了。打碎了就打碎了罷，算它帮了我一個忙。江氏笑道：老太爺也太省儉啦，抽旱烟一個月能抽多少錢，還要借這個機會把烟忘了。趙翁伸手到懷裏去，掏出一盒烟捲來。舉了一舉，笑道：我總捨不得買烟捲抽，爲了一盒烟捲的錢，至少可抽六七天的旱烟。可是把旱烟袋捧了，我就借着機會買兩盒抽抽罷。這是美人牌，老太太，您不抽一枝嗎？江氏不由得笑起來道：這眞是烟袋咀子帮了你的忙，把旱烟袋咀子捧了，你就抽起美人牌來了。趙翁哈哈笑道：親家太太，你這可算駡了我了，我這樣的老古董，還談得上什麽美人不美人，我不過挑一種新出的烟吸着試試罷了。（二六九）</p>

<h3>最新自動週率調整法</h3>
<p>— 明襄</p>
<p>普通收音機的調節機紐有三：音量調節，音調控制，以及最主要的週率調豐，前二者都已有自動控制的方法發明　本刊　有專文述過，而獨於道最主要的週率調整，未聞有能用自動法者。</p>
<p>收音機的週率調整，都在每級（成音週率放大級除外）的輸入電路内，以　　與電容器組成一調整電路，變更此電容　的電容量，使該電路的本身週率，與某電台所發電波的週率相諧振，然後方能接收某電台的訊號。</p>
<p>最近英國無線電雜誌，發表一自動週率調整的線路，極爲奇趣，此線路能與外來任何週率的電波相諧振，無需調整，完成這自動調整目的的機件，仍脫不了無線電的靈魂眞空管。</p>
<p>稍有無線電學識的，大概都知道眞空管管内各極間，都有一定的靜電容量存在，幾年前，科學家密勒氏（Ｍiller）曾發現此電容量在眞空管燃熱與冷却時，並不相同，不僅如此，且其變更的數值，究全　其空管輸出　，所用線路的種　而定，　言之，眞空管絲極與　槍間的電容量，可因其輸出線路的有效總阻而變更。</p>
<p>如在眞空管的屏路内，　一感應圈，其屏路總阻，必隨週率之升高而自動增加，因之影響栅絲間的電　量，所以我們可設訃一感應輸出的電路，使在長波時，栅極與絲極間的電容量，自動增加；短波時，自動减少，這樣，便可完成自動調整的目的了。</p>
<p>線路如　所示，簾栅放大管的輸入線路，無需調整，惟以　一三極管的栅絲兩極，與線圈Ｌ１相並聯，以代替通常的可變電容器，其屏極經一負荷惑應圈Ｚ與Ｂ電正極相接。設外來訊號週率變更，自動調整管屏路内Ｚ的有效感應度亦變，因之栅絲間的電容量亦自動更易，仍保持其諧振狀態。</p>
<p>當然在這種線路前，必須經過一前置選擇器，否則任何週率的電波同時諧振，收音機所發的聲音，勢必雜亂無章，無從選擇辨别了。</p>
<h3>直流電怎樣用變壓器</h3>
<p>— 石華玉</p>
<p>我們不是常常說直流電不能用變壓器嗎？爲什麽不能用呢？檢波管屏極回路普通不是都串聯低週率變壓器的初級線圈嗎？檢波管屏流不是純粹的直流嗎？爲什麽可以用變壓器呢？原來誘導電流産生由於導體在磁塲内運動，或者貫通圈内的磁力線之變化而生。的謂檢波管屏路輸出之直流原係波動之直流，通過低週率變壓器之初級線圈後産生變動之磁力線，此變動之磁力線貫通次級線圈，故次級圈中隨發生誘導電流。總而言之，祇要貫通次級之磁力線能夠發生變動，則均能産生誘導電流。使此磁力線發生變動者，或爲交流電或爲顫動直流電，均無不可。平穩之電池電流，設法使之斷　亦可　用。今若在變壓　初　通以　　之　　、　　電流　　（Ｂreak）時，次級即有誘導電流發生，若次級與初級之圈數成某種比例時，則初次級之電壓亦成某種比例而完成昇壓或降壓之目的矣。今旣了解上述之原理，則直流電亦可利用變壓器昇降其電壓矣。</p>
<p>普通交流收音機之電源變壓器稍加更變本可用於直流電源矣。如圖，Ｔ係電源變壓器。Ｍ爲電磁石，Ｑ鋼片其裝置完全與電鈴相同，但Ｑ之振動數以愈高爲愈有利。當ＱＤ截斷時，即不相接觸時，次級Ｓ即有電流産生。電容器容量較大，約在２Ｍfd而Ｍ8fd之間。蓋當初級電路在ＱＤ點截斷時，因初級之自誘，ＱＤ間必發生火花，爰成一振盪器，故初級電路之開閉受其影響截斷延遲，不能發生高電動力。如加入Ｃ電容器則自誘電流流入電容器，ＱＤ間無火花産生，即可得迅速之截斷而産生高電動力矣。至Ｍ上所繞綫圈之粗細，宜與初級相司，俾少損失。</p>
<h3>雙音擴聲</h3>
<p>— 春</p>
<p>因爲要使收音機中接收播音臺上所發放音樂的充分清晰，一般的機件，即使最精密的喇叭都不能達到目的，於是開始去設法用一種雙音擴聲的裝置，我從ＲadioCraft中去找出了幾種參考的資料，採取其中最完滿的，並且試騐了好幾　，收來的聲音，　　　的和最宏大的部　很清楚，我以爲這隻　音　聲已</p>
<p>滿足了我的慾望，這種方法並且十分簡單，不難一試，所費者不過二隻變壓器，二隻電容器，和多加一隻擴聲器而已，輸出眞空管亦須用二隻。現在拿最簡單的線路來說明，在無論那一種收音機上，都可以按照了這方法接連二隻擴聲器成爲雙音。</p>
<p>至於裝置的時候，擴聲器的式樣二隻各不相同，凡是擴聲器喇叭口愈大，低音的發揚愈清晰，反之擴聲器的喇叭　愈小，發揚高音的時候愈清晰，所以在雙音擴聲器的裝置上，二隻擴聲器一隻宜用狹小的口徑，另外一隻宜用廣大的口徑。變壓器最好用推挽式的，以留調和音階的地步，補救電容器之不足，電容器我個人所用的有十七片，普通可以○·○○二五爲標凖。如擴聲器中夾有雜音，可以拿推挽式變壓器的中心接頭（初級中間）接通乙電正極，但如果裝置適當時可不必接通，這亦祇有按照了試騐的成績而定，並不能固定須要接通，或者不必接通的。</p>
<p>這種雙音擴聲長處在不失眞音。大可以試騐一下。</p>
<h3>低週率變壓器代濾波阻流線圈的改良</h3>
<p>— ＫＭＫ</p>
<p>一般業餘無綫電研究家，都没一個人不打經濟方面着想，如交流電收音機裏　流部的濾波阻流線圈，有多數研究</p>
<p>家就用低週率　壓器來代替。這雖便利而經濟，但有一缺點，就是交流聲不能完全濾去，殊爲美中不足，因電流由Ｆ處輸入，在ＧＰ間而突然更變其流動方向，致變成一種不平穩的直流電，由Ｂ處輸出，這時的收音機中就要發生營營的交流聲了，在有上項弊端時可在ＧＰ間和負極間接一只２Ｍfd的固定電容器，（如圖所示）就可補救。</p>
<h3>小經騐</h3>
<p>— ＲＦ</p>
<p>硬橡皮忌日光</p>
<p>硬橡皮質之製品，不可晒於太陽光下。因日久以後，太陽光之力，可使硬橡皮起一種分解作用。致硬橡皮中之一部份硫磺，成一薄層而留其面上。而有漏電之弊，因之失其絶緣之效用。故用爲高壓絶緣之硬橡皮，對於此點須加注意。如能代以膠木質者，則較爲妥當。</p>
<h3>無誘導耗阻之繞製</h3>
<p>耗阻線繞製之電阻，每因誘導作用之故，而有産生反電壓之斃。欲免此弊，則繞法應用無誘導作用者，法如下：甲·將導線全長之半處折轉，使二端合在一處，而後將此變雙股之線，照平常方法繞之。乙·將線分成數層疊繞，每層之方向相反。（即第一層與第二層反，第二與第三反。）</p>
<h3>極性試驗紙</h3>
<p>用直流電時，若不能知其正負極，可以極性試騐紙辨别之。製法：取菲諾爾夫他林（Ｐhenolphthalein）一克·溶於少量之火酒中。另取食鹽一撮，溶於一杯之水中。然後將二液混合，取中國紙裁成小條，濕以此溶液，再行隂乾即成。用法：取此紙一條，以水濕之。將電之二極，分離少許觸於紙上。則電極附近發出鮮紅色者爲負極。其原理：蓋因電流流過食鹽之溶液，因電解作用負極發生輕養化鈉，輕養化乃鹼性物，故與菲諾爾夫他林作用而發紅色。（註：菲諾爾夫他林在儀器館及西藥房有出售。）</p>

<h3>無線電常識</h3>
<p>— 黃鑑村</p>
<p>（二十一）眞空管概說（五）</p>
<p>（八）速熱式交流管（Ｑuickbeatertype）：交流管以傍熱式最爲普及，因其方便，人多喜用之，然有一種缺點，即由加熱部（Ｈoater）發出之熱，須經絶緣體而傳導於隂極，其開始動作（Ｓtartingwork）因而遲緩。爲補救此種缺點計，在絶緣體開穿細孔，使其由輻射而供給熱量，此種設計雖可使眞空管開始動作加速，然另一方面，速熱性愈高則交流音愈易發生，故製造者必須將爾者之妥恊點適當選擇，方不致顧彼失此。目下比較具有速熱性之眞空管當推飛利浦牌，其開始動作時間普通在十秒至三十秒之間。</p>
<p>（九）高週率用五極管：四極管因有二次電子放射之故，以致屏電壓與屏電流不能作强大之變化，此種狀態業經述及。欲使屏電壓作强大之變化，自非增高屏電壓之值不可。交流式收音機或固定用電池式收音機對於增高屏電壓之事，頗爲容易；然而在移動用或汽車用之收音機，甚望電池之數量盡量減少，自不得使屏電壓增加。於是乃有五隨管出現以解决是種困難，其初尚僅限於低週率之用。近來則種種高週率用五極管亦相繼産生，如ＲＣＡ二三九號式管可供一汽車内收音機」之用，ＲＣＡ三四號式可供直流携帶式收音機之用，對於在高週率中間週率之放大，以及無極外差式之第一檢波等，盡其運用之能事，惟用爲普通之屏檢波則不可能。</p>
<p>近一年來所産生之所謂新式管五七號式以及五八號式者，係高週率用五極管之交流化者，其燈絲電壓均爲二·五弗打·而其展電壓更增至二百五十弗打，爲從來所未有，俗稱之曰交流二·五弗打管。</p>

<h3>電界之聲生命線</h3>
<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>據說東隣島國，在地圖上分界劃線，稱之爲「生命線」。其視爲第一生命線之範圍，早經造成一個僞國，同時我國通信電線，亦隨之損失約一萬五千公里；但國土旣失，此區區線路，正不值一提。我人對此，亦惟有慨然而歎！何足道哉！丨丨何足道哉！</p>
<p>日人所稱爲「生命線」，係侵略之代名詞，實際上旣與彼國之生存無關，即不能視作生命上所必要；不過「生命線」名詞，就字義言，頗覺新穎，若移用於電信上，亦頗覺確切，蓋電信事業，「線」實佔有重要位置。有線電及電話無論巴，即無線電，亦何嘗不用天地線。星羅棋布，一如人身之神經系統。苟以電信爲有生機，則此種遍達各地之線，固大可目爲電信交通之「生命線」。</p>
<p>電線關係交通，旣如上述，類乎人之生命，則整頓舊線路，無異延長電信之舊生命：建設新線路，亦不殊創造電信之新生命。旣爲生命所關，自屬不容漠視，故歷無交通當局，關於線路之設施、進行每不遣餘力。就近事言，若津浦，若京滬，均在計畫改築或新造線路，以通長距離電話，而平漢，隴海，滬漢，青滬，漢渝，以及津浦原有諸重要幹路，更陸續大舉修換木桿（木桿可視爲生命線之支持物），整理線條；餘若剿匪區域，衝要地帶，亦均佈置專門人員，從事修線。電信之能維持暢通者在此；電信生命之所託，似亦在此，查局内裝置之機器，與線路並重，若電線目爲「生命線」，則機器何書不可目爲「生機」；不過「一線生機」，生機究須恃一線之應用。聊爲曲解，幸勿以辭害意）。</p>
<p>進一步言，電線不但在電信交通上視同生命，即社會人士，平時不甚關懷者，每經變亂，對於線之通阻，率感覺充分之注意：否則，自閩變以來，浙邊電線，一生障碍，何以能引起各種謡傳？一遇恢復，何以又能使人心略定？此中自有關係，雖非直接，亦可間接推測時局與命運，謂爲「生命線」，誰曰不宜？</p>
<h3>電報局之今昔觀</h3>
<p>— 蟄聲</p>
<p>我國創辦電報，已有五十餘年之歷史，由官商分辦而官督商辦，而收歸國營，因性質之不同，時代之更迭，環境之變遷，一切制度風氣？亦隨之逐步轉移、漸易舊觀。兹將吾人近年來感覺今昔不同之點，列舉於後：</p>
<p>一·業務昔日之電報局，與保甲局緝私局等相髣髴，壁張告示，門懸虎牌，儼然官署也。入局發報者，猶向官廳繳納田稅之鄕人，低首下心，不敢多語。局内收發電報之員司，倨坐傲然，視若無覩，接收電報，須任其便，一言不合，呵斥隨之，發報人唯唯而退，莫敢與較。今之電報局則不然，收發電報處之設　，一如商店，收發人員，亦多和顔悅色，彬彬有禮，接待發報民衆，亦如商店之於顧客，遇有詢問，無不竭誠答復，洋釐找欵，一秉至公。各局更設有所謂業務稽查者，終日在外稽查信差送報之有無躭延或强索譯費送力等情事，並剌探一般民衆對於電局業務之意見，以便隨時改良而求適合民衆之需要。昔日衙門式之電報局，今已變爲商業化民衆化之機關矣。再舊曰報價，須按所隔省區遞加，即每隔一省，加收若干，旣繁且昻，嗣後改分本省隔省二種，近數年來，復改爲齊一報價，各省一律，便利實多。華文電報之收報人姓名住址，常多至七八字或十餘字，致一電報費，動輙數元，一般民衆，每嫌太費，自電報掛號辦法施行後，僅用一掛號字，即可代替收報人之姓名住址，最近各繁要城市，更可用電話號碼以代收報人之住址，尤爲便利。此外尚有賀年電報交際電報等，收費旣廉，且無延誤，業務上之革新，殊屬不少。</p>
<p>二·報務曩昔大小電局傳遞電報，不論報務之繁簡，一律用莫爾斯報機，遞電速率較遲，在繁忙之電路上，報務時有壅塞之虞。今則各繁要電局，一律裝農韋斯登快機，且多改用雙工通報即兩局在同一線上，可以同時發寄電報，京滬兩局，近更添裝新式克稱特快機，遞電速率之增加，奚啻倍蓰。處理報務人員，昔多重視官軍電報而忽視尋常商報，（即尋當私務電報）　則商報與官軍電報一律並重。據作者調查所得，上海與漢口天津烟台青島等處，往來電報，雖遠隔數千里，而有時兩端用電話收送，竟能於十餘分鐘内收得冋電，其傳遞之速，殊可驚於减價新聞電報、亦多隨到隨發，了無延誤，此次首都全國運動大會開會期間，各項運動消息之傳播，異常迅捷，博得輿論界之稱譽不少。</p>
<p>三·人員前清時代之電報局總辦，（即今之局長）大都係候補官員，或貴胄子弟，官氣十足，故全局上下，亦染成官僚化，如呼局長爲大人，稱報員爲師爺，一局之内，階級重重。局所設備，除少數繁要城市之電局外，均十分腐化，報務人員於公餘之暇，亦無正當娱樂，自鼎革以來，官僚習氣，漸次革除，充任局長者，每多革新之士，報務員之學識嗜好，亦與前逈異，各局均有書報社俱樂部等之組織。公餘之暇，或閱覽書報以增進智識，或鍜鍊身體以培養精神。近十年來電界之出版物，亦如雨後春笋，競吐新芽，其中如電友，電信雜誌，電流，電鐸，電鍵，電工，電光等，均爲社會上有價值之刊物。電信同人組織之足球隊，乒乓隊，亦棋隊等，亦常與外界競賽，成績然。對於救國工作，如捐助東北義勇軍，捐助十九路軍，捐助航空建設等，無不踴躍輸將，爭先恐後。故今日之電務人員，在社會上已頭角崢嶸，不似前此之默默無聞矣。</p>

<p>在同一電線回路中，電報和電話，裝置在同時可以通信的方式，我們稱之爲電報電話同　通信法（SimultaneousTelegraphyandTelephony）。這同時通信法，再分兩種方式：一爲單式回路（SimplexCircuit），即一電話回路内·祇裝電報回路一個。一爲複式回路（CompositeCfrcuit），則一電話回路内，裝置電報回路兩條。我國長途電話線，應用電報電話同時通信法的地方，尚不多覯。昔日鎭江揚州問長途電話回路，曾利以電報工作線兩條，構成一回路○雙方通話發報，成績甚佳。應用亦有年數。後以跨越長江的水底電線，被輪船鐵錨所毁斷，漂没未能修復，此種通信方法，久已廢置。現聞交通部籌設沿京滬公路的長途電話，亦有裝置電報電話同時通信法之議。兹特不揣辭費，述其概要，諒爲閱者所樂聞也。</p>
<p>單式回路的原理，實際和幻象回路的原理相同，如圖甲所示：Ｒ及Ｒ１爲電報機。Ｃ及Ｃ１爲　電器（Ｃondenser），其容最普通爲２m·f·oＴ及Ｔ１爲電話機。Ｌ及Ｌ１爲長途話線。　爲器流　輪（ＲetardotionCoit）。這塞流線　的抵抗力，通常爲五十歐姆，其接續方式，自電報機上接出，如兩臂的伸張，並列的把話機和外綫接續着，使兩端電話機，接成環狀的回路。這兩臂的抵抗力，平時總調整在平衡的狀態，如此，在電報機通報時，其同時引起電話線内的電位，爲相等的，故在電話綫上所流過的通</p>
<p>報電流，因兩綫電位的平衡，並不流入電話環狀回路中，而電話機通話時，受話機内，不致感受報機上發報的聲息。同樣的電話機通話時，其發生的交流電流，亦因兩線電位的平稀衡，及電報回路内蓄電器容量的關係，亦不致擾亂電報的工作。</p>
<p>至於複式回路的接續，應如圖乙。其１１爲五十歐姆的塞流線輪，１２爲三十歐姆的塞流線圇，Ｃ爲２mF蓄電器，R爲電報機，T爲電話機。圖中所示，爲電話一回路及電報兩回路。這複式回路的原理，和單式回路，略有不同</p>
<p>。其原理是利用塞流線輪的感應數較大，直流電通過尚易，高周波數的交流電，欲通過殊爲妨碍。在另一方面，回路内的蓄電器，則有相反的作用，即交流電通過蓄電器，毫無阻碍，如直流電經過，則將被其遮斷。換言之，電話電流爲高周波交流電，不能通流於感應係數較大的回路内，同時電報電流爲信號電流，是直流電，欲在直列接有蓄電器的回路内通過，亦爲事實所不可能。依此原理，復式回路的電報電話同時通信法得以構成。</p>

<h3>一年來電報業務之改進（下）</h3>
<p>— 劉駿詳</p>
<p>（八）委託中國旅行社代收旅行電報查旅行者，有於輪埠車站，欲將其行蹤電知其親友者，惟以電報局未必在其附近，殊無法發對其目的。即　報局在其附近，而舟車之停泊，爲略至暫，四時</p>
<h3>查問電報須知</h3>
<p>— 清華</p>
<p>（二）發報人查問電報須智</p>
<p>一·更正成補充收報人姓名住址發報人發電後，如自行發電收報人之姓名住址書寫錯誤，或接到電報局之通知，該電因收報人姓名住址不詳或錯誤，而致無法投遞時，可持原電收據向電報局發寄納費公電，將收報人之姓名住址加以更正或補充。例如原電爲「上海北京路華豐號，」因地址不詳，無法投遞，發報人乃請求補充爲「北京路東海里華豐號。」又如原電爲「南京中央販店某某君，」發報人在發電後，忽接收報人來電或來函云，已改住華僑招待所，乃請求更正爲「南京華僑招待所某某君，」以便收報局再行投案。</p>
<p>二·更正或補充電文發報人發電後，如發覺電文書寫錯誤，可持原電收據向電報局發寄納費公電，將電文更正。例如原電電文爲「欵六日可匯出，」旋因日期計算錯誤，擬改爲七日，可請求將電文第二字「六」改爲「七」。又如收報人因來電電文中某句發生疑義，而發寄納費公電查問·發報局接到此公電後，即通知發報人。發報人如欲使收報人明瞭起見，可將電文補充。例如原電電文中有「貨未寄」一句，收報人如因需貨甚急，不明發報人何故未寄，或疑「未」字係「已」字之誤，而發納費公電查問，發報人乃將原電電文補充爲「貨固受損緩寄。」如上述情形，收報人請求重傳「貨未寄」三字之納費公電報費，不能退還。發報人補充電文之納費公電，亦應另行繳付報費，　因電局並無錯誤之故也</p>
<p>三·註銷電報發報人發電後，如因某種原因，欲將該電註銷，可持原電收據向電報局發寄納費公電，將原電註銷。此項納費公電，祇按四字計費。如原電已送達收報人，收報局當通知收報人，將原電註銷，作爲無效。</p>
<p>四·查詢無回電發報人發電後，如等候多時，收報人迄無回電，可發寄納費公電查問，查問之方式有二：（一）查問電報已否送妥。（二）查問收報人何故未發回電。此項納費公電均須預付回電費，如欲收報局以郵函回復亦可，則祗須預付回信之郵資可矣。</p>
<p>五·查訽收報人掛號字樣發報人爲節省報費起見·凡收報人曾在收報局掛號者，可簡用掛號字樣代替收報人姓名住址，惟如一時記憶不清，可向電報局查閱電報掛號彚編，但編内所刊掛號字樣如有錯誤，或收報人業已停止掛號，則去電如無法投遞，電局不負其責。</p>
<p>六·查詢電報價目發報人如須查詢國内國際電報價目，可用電話，或親至電報局詢問。如每月發電甚多者，並可向電局索取價目表，以備隨時查閱。</p>
<p>七·查詢線路情形發報人爲便於指定電報經轉之線路起見，可隨時用電話或親至電報局詢問線路情形，惟電局對於收受之電報，照章均交傳遞最速之線路傳遞，祇國際電報之經轉線路，有無線電及水線之分，發報人可以任意指定。大抵無線電多係直達電路，且用高速度自動發報權傳遞，（並非人工發報），故極爲迅束凖確也。</p>
<p>八·聲請退費退還報費應由納費人（即發發報人）在電報發出之日起六個月内向發報局聲請之。（惟退還預付之回報費，應於三個月内聲請之）如因電報稽延過久，或未曾送達而聲請退費者，應將收報局或收報人所出之證明書附呈，（因電報稽延，如將收報人收到之來電原底附呈，亦可。）如因電報錯誤而聲請退費者，應將收報人所收到之來電原底附呈。惟須注意者，凡電報錯誤，業經收報人向收報局查問更正，或用納費公電向發報局查問更正者，不能再行聲請退費。</p>
<p>發電，亦殊感困難。交通部有鑒於此，爲便利旅行者起見，特舉辦旅行電報一種，委託辦理旅行業務業經有年之中國旅行社，在南京，上海，北平，天津，漢口，青島，六處先行試辦。成績良好，即謀推廣。旅行者旅行上述各地，於舟車停泊時，如欲發寄國内尋常加急電報，即可交由中國旅行社或該社所派之招待員代收轉送拍發，除報價久，不另收手續費。是有通信之便利，而仍無額外之耗費也。</p>
<p>（九）創設交際電報我國人民於日常交際，幾完全以西牘往來，鮮有發寄電報者，固以我國人民尚未養成利用電報之習慣，而電報價目之昻貴，亦爲其一大原因。交通部原訂有賀年電報一種，每年新年及耶誕前後，開放一次，照尋常電價目四分之一收費；惟該項電報，時間旣有限期，範圍亦過於狄小，收效不宏。兹經擴爲交際電報，凡關於新年，耶誕，結婚，壽辰，添嗣，開張，昇遷之慶賀，喪葬災病之弔慰，以及上述事項之答謝，均可適用。每字價目，華文本省二分，隔省四分，英文加倍：且該項電報，不獨來報由局台免費代譯，即去報局台亦可免費代譯，手續簡單，傳遞迅速，需費又省，其有利於社會交際，誠非淺鮮，而在電報業務本身，不啻另闢一新園地，將來之發達，自可預卜。</p>
<p>（十）新編羅馬字母電碼查我國所用電報碼號，係以四個數目字代替華文一字，兹交通部重編明密電碼新編，將内容加以改善。其尤具特色者，即每個華文字，除照舊附以數目字電碼外，復編予羅馬字母電碼。該項羅馬字電碼，係以三個羅馬字母編成一組，每組代替華文一字。發電者將各組羅馬字母，依次接聯排列，再按每十個字母編成一個洋文字，重行劃分，如此則華文十字，以三十個羅馬字母編成三個洋文暗語字，即可代替。現在國際報價，異常昻貴，每字輙需二三元之多，如用該項辦法，可省費不少，對於華僑與祖國通訊，殊多便利也。</p>
<p>綜上以觀，一年内電報業務之改進，殊有顯著之成績。在業務之本身立塲觀察，則稽斃掃除，事業擴充；在收發報人之立塲觀察，則費用减省，發報便利，收報迅速，總之，主持者務以最大之努力，期得最大之效果，而收發報人得以最低限度之費用，亨受最高之通訊便利，苟能循此邁進，則電報業務之前途，庶乎有望。</p>
<h3>新發現正性輕電子</h3>
<p>— 璋</p>
<p>吾人所知者，祇原子係兩基本電單位　或：即負性輕電子（ElectronNegatif）與正性重電子（ProntonPassitif）。但英國學者Blacket，與意國青年學者Occhialina因將上述兩種電子之運動攝影，發現一第三者，其體重比正性重電子更輕。因之成立最近科學界所公認之基本電單位正性輕電子。</p>
<p>該新電子與其他電子不同之點有二：第一，其所負者係正電；第二　，其生命祇有數千分之一秒時間。該新電單位已經英國堪畢其（Cambridge）實騐室拍有照片，可於照片上識之矣。</p>
<p>上述英意兩國學者，並證明該新電子雖與組成原子之正電子，負同性之電，但其體重較電子輕一千八百倍，且遇見負性電子時，正性電子之生命，即立時停止。其唯一生存之表現，係其顫動之頃，忽然放射。現在有二十餘照片皆表示出若干新電子之光線管，其濳伏電力，有數十萬萬伏爾脫之大去。</p>
<h3>日「滿」間電報制度（上）</h3>
<p>— 葉仲華譯</p>
<p>本文登載於日本遞信雜誌本年九月號，係遞信省電務局外信課國人所撰。旨在解釋日本統制東省電政之現狀。文中涉及九一八以前日本經營東省電政之回顧，藉可略窺東鄰侵略我國電政之壓史的階段。爰亟爲譯出，以嚮國人譯者識</p>
<p>八月三十一日遞信省以第三十五號及第三十六號訓令，制定日「滿」電報規則，及日「滿」無線電報規則，於九月一日起實施。同時原來之中日電報規則及中日無線電報規則，宣告廢止。此項新規則，與滿洲電信電話株式會社所統一經營調東州，兩滿洲，　道階屬地，及「滿洲國」之電信電話，有密切之關係，自不待言，而其主要目的，因從來關東州及南滿洲鐵道附屬地與日本間之電報制度，及「滿洲國」與日本間之電報制度，其價目及其他辦理方法，均有不同。此兩管區内，因有地理的關係，故非常不便。此次計劃統一，蓋即使兩管區有劃一之價目，並同樣處理之。兹在解釋日「滿」間改正電報制度之前，自應先將昔日日本在滿所經營之電信事業，略加闡述。</p>
<p>滿洲之日本電信事業</p>
<p>欲明瞭滿洲之日本電信電話事業，至少須回溯明治三十七八年日俄戰爭時代。當時日本於戰役中，已在滿洲各處架設軍用電信電話線，迨戰事告終，日本依樸次茅思條約，讓受關東州租借地，及南滿洲鐵道附属地。同時旅順芝罘間敷設之海底電綫及南滿洲鐵道附属地之電線，亦一併在内。關於上項電線及海線之處理與運用，即以明治四十一年中日兩國政府所訂之條約爲基礎，而關東州南滿洲鐵道附屬地内與中「滿」間電信之連絡，亦根據上述條約而實行。當滿洲事變時，所有關東州及南滿洲鐵道附屬地内與今日「滿洲國」之電信上連絡，祇有長春，鐵嶺，瀋陽遠陽，牛莊，及安東六處。其使用主法（一）即中日電線，在南滿洲鐵道附屬地交界接線，以供關東洲及南滿洲鐵道附屬地内與中國（包含滿洲）及中國以外諸國間來往電報之用。日本内地通信，則向未開放。（二）即在以上六處中國電信局内，設置日本電信收發處，與附屬地内日本局接線。此項電信連絡，係屬日本專用，與附屬地内日本局之内地通信（指日本内地）同樣辦理。迨滿洲事變後，更增設附屬地内外之電信連絡線，北滿地方與日本内地間之直接通信，亦復開設。關於此點，下文當更申述。</p>
<p>上述之日「滿」間電信連絡，祇在南滿洲鐵道附屬地沿線一帶。迄乎今日，日「滿」間之通信設施，自歸滿洲電信電話株式會社出資經營之後，事實上業已完全變更，而由會社一體經營矣！</p>
<p>關東州及南滿洲鐵道附屬地與日本間之電信事業</p>
<p>關東州及南滿洲鐵道附屬地之電信事業，與其他日本殖民地不同，因屬特殊，是以該地與日本間之電信制度，亦與日本國内電報或殖民地電報有異。然其不同之點，即在價目之規定，應依照昔日中日電報制度。至其他各項，悉照日本國内電報同樣處理之。（關於中日電報之價目從略）</p>
<p>「滿洲國」與日本間之電信事業</p>
<p>南滿洲鐵道附屬地六處之連絡線，專爲關東州及附屬地與中國及中國以外諸國通信之用，日本内地通信，則向例不能使用。故日本與現在之「滿洲國」間，在滿洲事變以前，迄無直接電信連絡之存在。因此昔日「滿洲國」與日本聞之通信，必須經由長崎上海間，或青島佐世保間海底電線，而依中國陸線之昻貴價目轉遞。一方中日電報，亦祇迄南滿洲鐵道附屬地沿線之郵便局爲止。此外實無其他妥便通信方法，是以迄　近爲止，滿洲日僑通信上之不便，實在想像之外也。</p>
<h3>半月消息社南　國内華文電報减價</h3>
<p>華文電報之收報人姓名住址，因我國文字關係，往往超過十字以上，是以每電報費，輙需一二元之譜，民衆因此不樂於利用電報。交通部現爲澈底便利民衆通信，及發展業務起見，將自明年一月一日起實行减價辦法如下：</p>
<p>（一）國内華文電報之收報人姓名住址及收報地名不逾十五字者，一律作五字收費，逾此按字加費。</p>
<p>（二）用電話號碼代替住址者，連收報人姓名及收報地名共作四字收費。</p>
<p>（三）用電報掛號代替姓名住址者，仍照向章收費，即連收報地名在内，華文明語電報按三字收費，華文密碼電報按二字收費。</p>
<p>（四）分送電報每添一收報人姓名住址，加三字計費，上述辦法實行後，普通二十字之電報，（假定姓名住址爲十五字電文爲五字），祗作十字收費，不啻對折減價，誠如商店之大廢價矣！</p>
<h3>國内加急電報減價</h3>
<p>國内加急電報向章尋常電價目三倍收費，交通部現爲便利商民，並與國際加急電報收費一律起見，將自明年一月一日起，改按尋常電價目二倍收費，此項辦法實行後，商家有緊要商情而發寄加急電者，可省費三分之一云。</p>
<h3>計劃改良收發電報手續</h3>
<p>交通部最近爲研究改良收發電報手續，藉以提高電報傳遞速率起見，曾召集京滬兩處之電報局及無線電臺主管收發電報人員，到部開會研究，聞結果甚爲圓滿，其議决原則爲減省各種不必要之手續，務求電報隨收隨發，在收發處減少稽延時間，如登記流水，及計算記賬電報（即預存報費之商行所發並不按電付費之電報）之報費等手續，均在電報發出後辦理。如此一方而　電報　　迅速、一方面便發報人無須久　，耗費時間，殊爲電報業務上之大改進云。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>古典的與近代的</h3>
<p>— 子林</p>
<p>是的，這裏的一切都是近代的，燈，牀，窗，沙發，鏡臺，和牆壁的裝色，雖不能如廣告所誇張着的什麽「主體派」的裝飾，但至少總不能不算是近代的了。就是那些侍者亦都是很年輕的，頭髮梳得光溜溜地，制服整潔的近代的侍者。</p>
<p>當我一走進那新開張的旅館，我首先　就感覺到，上海眞的不比從前，已經近代化得多了。同時我又還想到我們中國的傳統的專講匀整和對稱的裝飾藝術，如我從前家裏掛的一窗含西嶺千秋雪，門泊東英萬里船一這一類對聯，現在已經被近代的衝破了。</p>
<p>但當我把窗門打開來的時候；我馬上就聞到一陣鴉片烟的氣味，從隔壁的窗口吹來，在這時我就十分覺醒到我已經是回到我們中國來了。接着左邊的窗口，又送來了一陣麻雀牌碰擊的聲音，和女子的笑聲。</p>
<p>但是很奇怪，在這樣摩登設備的地方，却很少看得見摩登的青年男子。來往着的多是戴瓜皮帽，架墨晶眼鏡的黑漢子，他們有點像什麽機關的局長之類，或是從内地來上海不久的中小商人和地主。後來我看了一本穆時英的公墓來讀，然後恍然大悟的知道原來摩登的青年大概是在比這裏更摩登的地方同更摩登没姑娘去跳爵舞士了。想不到幾年後没有來到上海連我也變成一個落伍者丨</p>
<p>夜漸漸深了，走廊上却依然往來着許多女人。長長的眉毛，扁扁的鼻子，長長的耳環，垂在額前的黑髮，高到不能轉頸的領子，像飲了血的紅唇，兩寸高的高限鞋子，眞的許久没有看見中國的女人了，特别覺得有趣味，不過一看見他們雖然穿着最摩登的高跟鞋，但走起路來却究還老是，帶着八字式，於是乎又不能不歎息着人雖然摩登，却究竟還帶着一些中國的古風！</p>
<p>這一夜整夜都聞着鴉片烟的氣味，和打麻雀的聲音。在這樣輾轉不眠的一夜，就使我不能不想到吸鴉片烟的幾種不同的風格、例如像我們家鄕的老陳，他是一個泥水匠，他的烟槍和烟燈是隨時具備的，只要有空，他可以倒臥在樹隂下面，或暗巷中的僻靜處很隨便的吸幾口。這算是一格。又還有像我們家鄕裏敎「孔子曰」的老秀才，他除了敎會以外，整天都是一榻横陳，油燈如荳的，細細的抽吸，於鴉片烟吸夠之餘，然後舉手翹足拉長了聲音，暢論一些上下古今，而到於摇筆爲文，一氣呵成的寫出什麽「關門閉户掩柴扉」的名句。這兩種吸鴉片烟的風格大概可以說他是浪漫的，抑是古典的罷。至於住在我隔壁的那個留八字鬚的中年人，他是躺在淡綠色的燈光下、「立體派」的木床上來吸鴉片的。</p>
<p>這種吸烟的風格在我還是生平第一次看見，我想這大概可以說是寫實的或是近代的罷！</p>
<h3>臭豆腐乾</h3>
<p>— 衛貞</p>
<p>「臭豆腐乾！三個銅板買兩塊：」一種清脆可聽的呼聲，隨着了一陣說不出的香味，散佈到了一條弄裏的週圍；二樓亭子間嫂嫂，三樓亭子間阿狗娘，前房太太，後房小姐，灶披嬸嬸……好像蒼蠅見了糖一般，鶯聲招展，自然的聚起來，將這担臭豆腐乾，圍得水洩不通，你買四塊，我買六塊，藉令得一身兼數職的丨股東，經理，又賣貨員的炸豆腐乾　家手忙脚亂，應接不暇，撕開了黃金色的牙齒的油　、合不攏來，口涎在向豆腐乾上添香料，不斷的噴洒……。</p>
<p>買花讃花香，原是人們的慣例；没有一個人對於自已的貨物，而願加上醜惡名詞；但，賣自豆　腐乾的，他非祇不讚自已的貨物是頂好，而且大聲疾呼的告訴人們是臭的，我想：世界上最誠實的人，祇有他們吧；本來他們的生意可做不成了，不，事實告訴我，很多人趨之若鶩呢！可見得，無論一件物或是一個人都好，用不着人們的褒奬和揶揄的，祗求本身的實際和眞味，斷不怕遭社會的擯棄的！臭豆腐乾就可以給我們一個好的證據了。</p>

<h3>回力球場的最後一晚</h3>
<p>— 雲池</p>
<p>在這裏，你可找到兩種不同的賭客；一種是没辦法消遣的資産階級；一種是絶無生路的失業民衆。前者僅以金錢作遊戲，後者却以生命爲孤注。以金錢作游戲的，往往贏得金錢，以生命爲孤注的，一定失去生命。</p>
<p>洛可夫，自從賭了回力球以後，已經不像人了：兩眼突出，雙頰凹進，那灰黃的臉色，彷彿長期的肺病者。在他自已，何常也不知道這是末路的計策。然而，因爲他太愛惜生命，便不惜拿生命作爲賭本：不賭，明知將來要自殺；賭，也許有翻身的一天。就這樣，他日夜作了幻滅的追求者。</p>
<p>借當的方法固然無所不用其極，即就盜竊的念頭，也時虱在他的腦中浮沉。「人生到了末路的時候，還怕什麽幹不得！」他常這樣想。但，他畢竟没有這般勇氣。</p>
<p>今天，是洛可夫到回力球塲去的最後一晚了。從各處的借當，他凑成了二十塊錢，在别人眼中看來，這區區的敷目，算得什麽。但他正以爲這是生命的代價。贏則仍可苟延殘喘，敗則全家同歸於盡。</p>
<p>他祈禱了上帝，告别了妻子，鼓著勇氣，直赴霓紅燈輝煌的亞爾培路，好似開往戰場一樣的莊嚴。</p>
<p>他獨自坐在一隅，凝神地注視着整個球員的動作。拉摩司，沙特浪谷，爾加，亞爾培地，古巴龍，后蘭多，六位甲組球員的影像，在他的心中打漩渦。</p>
<p>洛可夫看了幾盤，才决定拿這二十塊錢孤注在爾加身上。這是第十二盤，爾加是放在六號裏。「其餘的都是熱門，即就中了也贏不了多少錢，惟有爾加的六號，眞是冷之又冷。要是他贏出來的話，一張十塊頭的票子，至少有一百多元。而且爾加今天打得不錯，就拿生命去冒險一下吧！」他這樣想了之後，兩脚已不由自主地走到買票的地方了。</p>
<p>他顫抖着雙手，從袋裏摸出兩張十塊頭的鈔票，換了兩張紅綠的紙頭。</p>
<p>鈴聲終止了，裏面走出兩個評判員，洛可夫見了他們，好像覺得是殺他的劊子手，忽然銀笛一聲，全場肅靜，無線電也聽話的停止歌唱。</p>
<p>洛可夫站在鐵絲網的前面，心裏仆仆的作跳。</p>
<p>他的熱血隨着球聲奔騰，他的眼睛跟着球員轉移。一忽兒，臨到爾加上場了。他更鼓着勇氣，對着鐵絲網空裏大聲呼喊着：</p>
<p>ComeonAcha，ComecnAcha！</p>
<p>果然，爾加打贏了一分。這時他的臉上現出紅色。他的兩手盡力地拍着，震動了整個球場。因爲他的生命是交在爾加的手裏。但，同時作「嘘」聲的也不少，因爲爾加是冷門，大部分的賭客，都不要他贏。</p>
<p>然而，爾加終算爭氣，在「嘘」與「拍」之中，又打贏了一分。這時洛可夫更歡呼得起勁：</p>
<p>ComeonAcha！ComeonAcha！！</p>
<p>洛可夫的手脚都用足了勁兒，要是没有鐵絲網的障礙，也許他會衝進球場裏，去帮助爾加。</p>
<p>爾加一連打了四分，洛可夫見了，心眞要從肚裏跳到口外了。他又拚命的拍掌。雖然兩手已拍痛，還是不覺得。ConeonAcha！！！Onemore！！！</p>
<p>他對着爾加這樣歡呼着。如果再打一分，他的生命便可保持了。</p>
<p>這時爾加正同拉摩司對打，洛可夫早已有了戒心，因爲他知道爾加打不過拉摩司的。</p>
<p>他的臉上一忽兒紅，一忽兒白。那知爾加開球的時候，就打在第一條紅線裏面。</p>
<p>“Mala！”評判員舉高了手，這樣喊了一聲。這一聲“Mala”呀，無異一顆彈丸打進了他的胸膛。於是洛可夫的臉色由白變青，由青變灰。</p>
<p>然而，别人祇得一二分，爾加已有了四分，這一場還没完有結。爾加仍舊有臨着的機會。</p>
<p>現在是拉摩司同沙特浪谷打了。那知沙特浪谷一連打敗四個球員，所以他又獲得四分。於是又挨着爾加了。這是四分對四分打，成敗在此一着，未知鹿死誰手。</p>
<p>洛可夫的生命，就在這一瞬間。他不敢抬頭再看了。他將要在鉛絲網前昏暈去了。</p>
<p>刹那間，忽然聽得銀笛一吹，掌聲如雷。他知道事情有些不妙。看看那分數牌上的分數，果然是沙特浪谷贏的。爾加祗得四分，不中用。</p>
<p>他呆呆地站着，幾乎不能支持他的身體。帶着旋律的無線電，作了他的輓歌，送他走出了門口。</p>
<p>次晨，各報的本埠新聞，登着一條無名男子投浦的消息，查無家屬，當由普善山莊賜柩一具，掩埋屍身。</p>

<p>可是，知識恐慌，這正是每個青年共有的感覺，尤其是我們失學底一羣，更急切地感到需要。我極希望大家研究研究，可是同事方面，又很少和我同調的，因爲他們都是有家室妻子之累的人了。所以，我是孤獨地一個了。</p>
<p>廠裏雖定了兩份日報，（申報和新聞報）然而在工作時間，也不能容你有多麽充分的閱讀：環境這樣，使人實在没法兒想了。不過，無論如何，我對於文藝是很感興趣的。在增刊上，看到許多動人的偉大的作品，使我感到欽佩，使我慚愧。我總有「同樣是青年，我爲什麽這般没用呢？」的疑問。我常這樣自賣與自勵，可是，一個人暗中摸索又怎能有進步？因此我就把目光移轉到圖書館和寫稿子上去。誰也知道，圖書館是增進知識的一個最好的去處。投稿呢？更可以鼓起寫作品的興致。因此，我有兩個問題，很抱歉的要求先生指示我。自然嚗，先生是决不會有如許空閒工夫的，可是，這裏我萬分誠懇地請求你，無論如何，給我一個覆信，時間的遲早，倒不在乎的。我要問，投稿到增刊是可能的嗎？我可夠得上嗎？稿紙須怎樣寫？投稿的手續如何？還有關於圖書館的，據說貴報附設的流通圖書館，書籍出借，需要保證金二元，而申報的讀者，只要一元。不知我可算是申報的讀者嗎？能蒙到優待不能？可以的話，需要什麽東西來證明。（因爲廠中的報，是向報販定的。）很可笑的兩個問題，要重重的廠煩你了丨祝你撰安王元星謹上</p>

<p>編者按：王君能在極煩忙的工作後，還時刻不忘增進智識的企求，眞可謂爲好學者矣。本報附設的流通圖書館，純爲服務社會性質，一切均不收費。不過爲著要保障出借的書籍，不致無端損失起見，才有每個讀者需繳保證金的規定。日後任何讀者，因事退出，該項保證金，仍如數奉還。照足下的情形，倘使能夠出示報販的收條，也可以接照本報讀者資格，加以優待，而祗收一元。此外如其足下因爲路遠，往返不便，那麽只要你第一次親自來館一次，以後就可按照郵借辦法辦理，運寄給書你時的郵費，也由館方負担。至於投稿這一件事，也大可一試。本報以及其他各報的附刊，大都歡迎投稿的。投稿的手續，也很簡便，只須將稿件，加以新式標點清很直寄各報，信面書明XX附刊字樣足矣。最近文臺上很注重現實生活的描寫，對於又文字藝術方面，不如從前那樣的嚴格了。像這樣生活豐富的人，倘使能夠用創作的精神，來寫稿了，前途很有希望。不過各刊都有　的立場，你須得細心體會。同樣一篇文字，X刊不登載，同時會被其他附刊所歡迎的。這點須得注意，否則編輯先生，鐵面無私，難免要給你一個失望的。</p>

<h3>上海（二十）</h3>
<p>— 張老三</p>
<p>卅一醫藥費</p>
<p>一個問題襲上我的心頭來，生了兩個月病，在病勢沉重的時候，我是昏昏沉沉什麽都不知道，延醫服藥，一切費用在我想來或者也是個可驚的數目。社中的任何一個人是不能夠擔任的，他們和我一樣，除了這個身體可以換錢之外，想安安穩穩袋中有整疊的鈔票，眞是夢也做不到的事。這時候我　見弟弟摸出一塊銀洋來，很想知道這竟究，或者我已帶害了許多朋友。一句話在喉間湍有衝出，每姊對我以目示意，而且轉換了說話的方向。</p>
<p>「弟弟來，今天晚上我請你吃館子去。」她撫着弟弟的頭向慧姊歡笑。</p>
<p>慧姊槍過弟弟的手，把他抱在懷中說。</p>
<p>「我請你看跳舞去。」</p>
<p>一陣大笑，把這疑團搪塞過去。</p>
<p>我的身體漸漸復原，先慢慢地披閱一些外來的稿件。慧姊晚上每天到社中來，她說的來對於文藝發生興趣，不將帶來短詩和小品文字。雖不見得是佳作，然而一個都市姑娘忽然能改變常態而致力於文藝這類的把戲，多少我是很快樂的。她更說起學校中近來組織了一個戲劇社，她因爲一個多月没有到校，失却了一次表演的機會，似乎很可惜似的。</p>
<p>「唔一個多朋没有到校，家裏有事嗎？」我目光没有離開我的紙筆，一時神經過敏，認爲舅父發生了不測的事，所以說話的語氣顯得十分驚慌。</p>
<p>敏姊打跌着說：</p>
<p>「你生病的時候她天天在你榻畔你没有瞧見囑？」</p>
<p>在客廳中的朋友都笑了，我也隨和着笑；然而那醫藥費的問題，却又在我記憶中浮蕩起來，我至今還没有明白誰帮了我這個大忙，而又没有一個認爲適可的機會和適可的人物來解决我這個悶葫蘆。</p>
<p>當晚我借着散步爲名，拉高飛出來，像有意像無意地說到這問題上。</p>
<p>「高飛，想不到我會害這樣重的病。」</p>
<p>「你凡事也太認眞了，這老脾氣我以爲應該改改」他斜也着眼珠兩手向上一伸，話像威廉海士表演的滑稽姿勢「以後恐怕…」</p>
<p>「别說廢話了」我打斷了他的話「這筆醫藥費不知使我負了多少債？」</p>

<h3>After Negotiations in Guangdong, Zhang Ji and Others Go to Wuzhou, Will Stay in Nanning for Several Days to Discuss Everything with Li Bai, Must Still Transfer to Guangdong for Discussion on the Way Back, Hu Hanmin's Declaration Has Been Issued</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Zhang Ji, Ma Chaojun, Chen Zhaoying, and Wang Luyi boarded the Guangzhou-Sanshui train at 6 AM on the 15th and transferred to a boat to Guangxi. They will arrive in Wuzhou in the afternoon. Li Bai sent Ye Qi to Wuzhou to greet them. On the morning of the 16th, they will continue to Nanning. Zhang and others will stay in Nanning for several days to discuss in detail with Li Bai. Then they will return to Guangdong for further discussion before returning north. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) After Zhang Ji, Ma Chaojun, Wang Luyi, and Chen Zhaoying, the four representatives, arrived in the province, they exchanged opinions on the current situation with various committees here several times in the past two days. Yesterday, they also attended the joint meeting of the political committees of the Southwest Executive Department. A general idea has now emerged. This morning at 8 AM, the four representatives took a special train prepared by the Railway Bureau directly to Sanshui and transferred by boat to Wuzhou. The authorities pre-assigned military police to protect them at the station. Zou Lu, Chen Jitang, and other relatives and friends of the four representatives all gathered at the station to see them off. Zhang Renmin, Chief of Staff of the Fourth Group Army, and Qiu Changwei, Senior Advisor, accompanied them. (15th Far East Telegram)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) The four Nanjing representatives, along with Gui Army Chief of Staff Zhang Renmin, went to Wuzhou this morning to visit Li Bai. The representatives originally planned to return to Nanjing directly from Guangxi. However, because the Fourth Plenary Session has been postponed for a month, they will probably come to Guangdong again to discuss matters calmly with the Southwest leaders to clarify the current situation. The various front lines of Guangdong Province are still peaceful. Troops are concentrated at the border to consolidate defenses, which has been completed. (15th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) A routine meeting of the Southwest Political Committee was held at 10 AM this morning. During the meeting, the various points discussed by the four representatives from the south were discussed. It was decided to put the principles in writing and send someone to Hong Kong to seek Hu Hanmin's approval, and then hand them over to the four representatives to convey to the central government. (15th Far East Telegram)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Hu Hanmin issued a declaration today, absolutely opposing the rebellion against the Kuomintang in Fujian Province. The methods proposed by Hu to resolve the current political situation are as follows: (1) Adhere to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings and implement the Three Principles of the People. (2) To eliminate the Fujian rebellion, the government must represent the interests of the people. (3) The government's goal must be to resist the aggression of imperialists and safeguard national independence externally, and to implement local autonomy and protect freedom of speech internally. (4) Soldiers are not allowed to interfere in civil administration, and military power must be in the hands of the government. (5) Centralize military power so that the army has a practical allocation for resisting Japan, suppressing communism, or defending the borders. (6) Stipulate the functions and powers of the central and local governments. (7) Implement tariff autonomy, abolish various miscellaneous taxes, plan rural relief, develop transportation, and revitalize industry and commerce. (8) Select virtuous and capable people who are willing to abide by the Kuomintang's doctrines to fill various government positions. (15th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Hu Persuades Xiao Not to Leave Guangzhou</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Hu Mulan arrived in the province on the 15th with Hu's orders to discuss the current situation, and to persuade Xiao Focheng not to return to Siam. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Hu Hanmin's daughter, Mulan, arrived here from Hong Kong today, representing her father to ask Xiao Focheng to abandon his intention to leave Guangzhou and move to Siam. Ms. Hu brought a handwritten letter from her father, advising Xiao to stay in Guangdong to assist in national affairs. (15th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Liu Yinlu and Others Return to the Province from Hong Kong</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Liu Yinlu, Chen Rong, and Li Xiangen returned to the province on the 15th. Huang Yanzhen returned to the province on the 15th to report on defense matters. Cheng Bijin returned to the province from Yunnan on the 15th. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Hu Hanmin's Attitude Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>(Guangzhou) Hu Hanmin's attitude remains unchanged, so the outcome of Zhang Ji's visit is still difficult to predict. Mr. Hu has decided not to go to Nanjing. However, the external appearance of the current situation is not completely hopeless. Guangdong's leaders seem to be engaging in consultations in a friendly spirit, so the hope of reconciliation remains. The leaders here and the leaders of the hardliners also claim that before the peaceful consultations have yielded results, the Southwest government does not intend to make any decisions on the Fujian situation. Therefore, whether Ning and Guangdong can cooperate can be decided within a few days. The Nanjing representatives stated that the central government is willing to accept the proposal to abolish party rule and include non-party members in the discussion of national affairs. They mentioned the mission of their visit to Guangdong and the central government's position. According to the talks, since the outbreak of the Fujian situation, the Kuomintang has suffered considerable setbacks. The central government is particularly saddened by the fact that Li Jishen and Chen Mingshu did not hesitate to use external forces to engage in internal strife and that some advanced members of the Kuomintang participated in the Fujian rebellion. Because Guangzhou is the birthplace of the revolution, the National Government firmly believes that it can gain the sympathy of Guangdong Province. The government is extremely willing to unite as one, because the unity of party members is the only way to save the country. Therefore, the delegation came here to express the central government's policy towards the Fujian situation and its difficulties, explain Nanjing's plan for Fujian, and exchange Southwest's views on the Fujian situation, hoping that Ning and Guangdong can reach a consistent resolution to be passed by the Fourth Plenary Session. The representatives also said that if necessary, they will go to Guangxi Province. Although the current negotiations are underway, military preparations on the front lines have not been relaxed. The defenses of the Dongjiang River have now been completed, but the security of the Xijiang River has begun again. A certain brigade of Chen Guanghan's unit has been ordered to go to Sanshui, and the independent brigade stationed in Zhaoqing has been ordered to go to Hainan. Other military deployments are also underway. (15th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) A statement was issued here, announcing Hu Hanmin's attitude towards the political situation. Hu's secretary told a Hong Kong reporter that: (1) Rumors that there is already an agreement between Hu, Chiang, and Wang are absolutely unfounded. (2) Hu's attitude towards the Fujian rebellion remains unchanged. (3) Rumors that Hu will join hands with Guangxi and Guizhou to organize a third government are completely meaningless. (4) Hu's attitude towards Fujian and Nanjing has been seen in various telegrams, and he will publish an article in the next few days to express his views. (15th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Says He Will Not Go South for the Time Being</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Yesterday, foreign news reported that the central government will ask Sun Ke and Dai Chuanxian to continue to go to Hong Kong and Guangdong to meet and discuss with the central committee members in the southwest. A reporter visited Sun on the 15th, who said that the central government originally had this intention, but after Zhang Ji and others went south, no detailed reports have arrived in Nanjing, so this matter cannot be discussed at present. (15th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>Fujian and Zhejiang Troops Have Not Made Contact, Fuzhou is Facing a Grain Shortage, Communist Troops Discovered in Yanping, Lianjiang and Various Ports are in the Hands of the Navy, The Road from the Upper Reaches of the Min River to Zhejiang Has Been Blocked</h3>
<p>(Hangzhou) Quzhou Telegram on the evening of the 15th: The Zhejiang border is peaceful. More than a thousand bandits were discovered in Chong'an, northern Fujian. Liu Heding has sent troops to disperse them. Fujian troops are gathering in Yanping, but there has been no contact. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Yu Jishi Talks About Thorough Zhejiang Defense</h3>
<p>(Hangzhou) Yu Jishi, Director of the Zhejiang Security Office, returned yesterday from an inspection of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi border and issued a statement today: "I have inspected Yushan, Guangfeng, Shangrao, Baishaguan, Qingbanqiao and other places. Generally, people believe that places such as Zhangjiawan, Shangzhuang, and Xiazhuang between Kaihua Youxikou and Baishaguan are semi-bandit areas. During this inspection, porters and travelers were everywhere. Not only is the statement that they are semi-bandit areas unbelievable, but most of the residents are also good people. There are still red bandit slogans on the walls of the pavilions from Youxikou to Baishaguan and from Haolingguan to Baishaguan. I have ordered the local military and police officials to be responsible for brushing them off at any time. There are a total of ninety miles from Youxikou to Kaihua. During that time, it is necessary to pass through Tantou Village. The village is five miles away from Youxi and has three blockhouses built in a pyramid shape. Each blockhouse is equipped with ten rifles for defense. Even if there is a large group of bandits, it will be difficult to fly over. Currently, troops belonging to this office are stationed in eastern Jiangxi and on the Zhejiang border. The officers and soldiers are familiar with the terrain and understand the bandit situation, so the defense is very thorough and it is difficult for the bandits to succeed." (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Holds a Meeting to Condemn the Rebels</h3>
<p>(Hangzhou) All sectors of Zhejiang Province will hold a meeting at 1 PM on the afternoon of the 16th to condemn the Fujian rebels. Various agencies, groups, schools, and factories will participate and hold a city-wide parade. The Provincial Public Security Bureau will send a large team to participate in maintaining order, and the Aviation School will send planes to patrol the city airspace. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Communist Party is Very Active in Xiamen</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Fujian puppet government has allied with the Communists, and Xiamen has also been affected. The Communist Party has been very active recently, posting reactionary slogans everywhere. On the 11th, red flags were suddenly discovered on the mountains and in the sea, causing great panic among Chinese and foreign residents. (15th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Fact that Fujian Allied with the Communists is Gradually Becoming Clear</h3>
<p>(Fuzhou) Although the Fujian authorities deny that they have allied with the Communists, the fact that they have allied with the Communists is gradually becoming clear. According to passengers who arrived here by small steamer, they saw communist troops in Yanping. Because they saw that the communist troops were carrying flags with hammers and sickles, they did not disembark in Yanping and went directly here. It is said that a communist troop is now advancing westward, intending to occupy Jianyang, but this has not been verified. The 19th Route Army is now gathered in Gutian to prevent government troops from bypassing Yanping and entering Fuzhou from other routes. Liu Heding leads 10,000 provincial troops who have not changed sides and are still guarding Jian'ou, which proves that the rumor that Liu's troops have been replaced by Zhejiang troops is completely false. There has been a small contact near Jian'ou, but this cannot be verified. The Nanjing Marine Corps is now occupying Lianjiang, 33 miles north of Fuzhou, and other coastal ports. Therefore, if the 19th Route Army attempts to advance north and invade Zhejiang, it will be very easy for the government troops to land on the coast. The road from the upper reaches of the Min River to Zhejiang has been completely blocked. Airfields have been built in both Jian'ou and Pucheng. Once the war starts, these will be used as bases for air strikes against the rebels. (15th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Accumulated Salaries Not Paid, Resentment Gradually Arises</h3>
<p>(Fuzhou) The impending grain shortage in Fuzhou, the appearance of 1,000 communist troops in Yanping, and the resentment of the soldiers of the 19th Route Army are likely to accelerate the collapse of the new government here. Today, two people openly identified themselves to the Reuters correspondent as representatives of the Communist Party. The connection between the Fujian government and the Communists in Jiangxi Province is even more obvious. The soldiers of the 19th Route Army, except for the one yuan given to each person to celebrate the establishment of the new government, have not been paid for six months, and resentment is gradually rising. One soldier told the Chinese clerk of the Reuters office in Fuzhou that he would join a hundred-man group, intending to abandon the army and start a life of banditry. The blockade imposed by Nanjing is now gradually having a serious impact here. Business has stopped, and rice prices have soared. It is said that there is only one month's worth of food here, and it is feared that assistance from Hong Kong will also be difficult. There is increasing evidence to prove that there are differences of opinion between Chen Mingshu and the radicals. Two members of the Chen faction who held senior positions in the government have now resigned. There are 1,000 red soldiers near Yanping. Although there is no evidence that they are cooperating with Fujian, it is a fact that they are not fighting each other. Yanping is the gateway to Fuzhou. The area is still quiet, but the Fujian military commander has stated that he cannot guarantee the safety of foreigners. There is now only one Spanish priest staying in Yanping. He is unwilling to go anywhere else and is willing to risk his life to protect the fifty girls in his church. The defense works in Fuzhou are progressing rapidly to prevent attacks from the east or south. The 78th Division commanded by Qu Shou Nian has left Fuzhou and is heading towards the border of Zhejiang Province along the highway parallel to the coast. The marines who are now stationed at the fort north of Fuzhou and who do not obey the Fujian government are all from Fujian. The Fujian government is afraid that these Fujian soldiers and marines will respond to each other, so they will be withdrawn and replaced by the 78th Division. (15th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Fujian Declares Protection of Industry and Commerce</h3>
<p>(Fuzhou) Yesterday and today, the People's Government and the Economic Committee held a meeting with representatives of chambers of commerce from various counties. The representatives said that labor movements and commerce are closely related and asked that careful selection be made of guiding personnel. The provincial government today rejected the proposal to issue special transfer bills for county chambers of commerce, believing that there were many malpractices. The Provincial Military Police Supervisory Office was renamed the Provincial Anti-Smoking Supervisory Office today, specializing in anti-smoking. Branch offices will be established in various counties. The headquarters issued an order strictly prohibiting officials' relatives from inviting people to smoke and gamble. The new provincial system is scheduled to be implemented in January next year. (14th Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Central Government Tries to Avoid War</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain Central Committee member said that the Central Government has not received a telegram from Chairman Lu of Zhejiang Province regarding the claim that Fujian has concentrated its forces and is moving towards Zhejiang. Therefore, he has not heard about it. The Central Government is showing leniency towards Fujian, and Chairman Chiang and others have repeatedly telegraphed the officers and soldiers of the 19th Route Army, urging them to wake up. They cannot bear to see Fujian Province suffer this unwarranted disaster. Therefore, even though nearly a month has passed, there has been no punitive action. If there are any other changes, the Central Government will try to avoid them within the realm of possibility. In short, if it does not offend Zhejiang, the Central Government will use political methods to resolve the issue. Otherwise, a military solution will be inevitable. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Liu Heding Promoted to Commander of the 39th Army</h3>
<p>(Nanchang) Liu Heding and Zhou Ziqun's troops in northern Fujian sincerely support the central government. In addition to repeatedly sending telegrams of commendation, Chairman Chiang also issued a clear order on the 11th, announcing the promotion of Liu Heding to commander of the 39th Army and Zhou Ziqun to commander of the newly formed 11th Division. (15th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>Zhao'an Falls into a State of Anarchy</h3>
<p>(Xiamen) Zhao'an County Magistrate He Shijun and the people who received Zhang Zhen have all fled to Hong Kong. Zhao'an has fallen into a state of anarchy. Small steamers between Shantou and Zhao'an have all been detained in Shantou. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Huang Qiang Flies from Xiamen to Zhangzhou to See Cai</h3>
<p>(Xiamen) Huang Qiang flew from the province to Zhangzhou on the 15th to see Cai, and returned to Xiamen in the afternoon. He will also take over as mayor within a few days. The Provincial Military Police Supervisory Office was renamed the Provincial Anti-Smoking Office. Deng Hechun, along with Ye Shaoquan, director of the Xiamen branch office, arrived in Xiamen from the province on the 15th to prepare for the establishment of the Xiamen branch office. The new government has stipulated new anti-smoking measures. The Anti-Smoking Supervisory Office will handle this matter. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Huang Shaoxiong Arrived in Jinan Last Night</h3>
<p>(Jinan) This morning, Han Fuju hosted a banquet for Huang Shaoxiong at Zhenzhuquan. In the afternoon, Huang visited Baotu Spring, Daming Lake, and other famous scenic spots. In the evening, Li Shuchun, the Minister of Civil Affairs and a classmate of Huang's from the Baoding Military Academy, hosted a banquet for Huang. Huang went south at 9 o'clock. Han and other dignitaries saw him off at the station. Huang said that he had a very good impression of Jinan and that Shandong's politics are more on track than other provinces. Internal affairs are being reorganized and preparations are being made internally. Even if the whole country cannot be put on track immediately at the same time, it is good if one province can do it as long as there is a way. A few days ago, he went to Mongolia and saw that the benefits of animal husbandry in the fertile plains were very great. As long as people are not dead at heart, there is no reason for China to perish. Han also said that even if China only has two or three provinces left, if it strives to become strong, it can still be a second- or third-rate country in the world. Huang said that because of the limited time, he did not get off the train to see Feng in Tai'an. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) Central Committee member Ding Weifen went to Jinan at 7 AM on the 15th. After sorting out his personal affairs, he will transfer to Nanjing on the 17th. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Ding Weifen arrived in Jinan to meet Huang Shaoxiong. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Central Government Holds an Important Meeting</h3>
<p>Yang Dezhao Attends to Report on the Recent Situation in Guangdong Province</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held a certain important meeting at 3 PM on the 15th. More than 20 people attended, including Lin Sen, Wang Jingwei, Sun Ke, Yu Youren, Ye Chucang, Tang Youren, Xu Mo, Zhu Peide, He Yaozu, Huang Musong, Chen Yi, Shao Yuanchong, Wang Shijie, and Chen Gongbo. Yang Dezhao, Chen Jitang's representative, also attended to report on the recent situation in Guangdong Province. Yang Dezhao, Chen Jitang's representative in Nanjing, came to Nanjing this time to ask the central government to borrow 15 million yuan for Guangdong, but this has not been completely decided. Yang attended a certain meeting of the Central Government on the 15th and went to Shanghai that night, urgently needing to return south to report everything to Guangdong. He will set off to return to Guangdong on the 18th or 19th of this month and return to his hometown to celebrate his father's birthday. The date of his return to Nanjing cannot be determined for the time being. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Negotiations on Receiving Yuguan, Ready to Move to Tianjin, The Japanese Side Will Send Iwai to Tianjin, It is Hoped that the Takeover Can Be Implemented by the End of the Year, Yin Tong Stays in Beijing to Discuss Through Traffic, Yin Rugeng Will Go to Tongzhou to Work</h3>
<p>(Beiping) It is planned to negotiate the matter of receiving Yuguan in Tianjin. Tao Shangming and Yuan Tai are scheduled to go to Tianjin tonight to make contact in order to ask for instructions at any time and ask the Japanese side to send representatives to Tianjin to handle the matter. The Japanese side has not yet replied, but can send Iwai to Tianjin to negotiate. It is heard that the takeover can be implemented by the end of this year. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Tao Shangming, Yuan Tai, and Iwai meet, there should be no problem with the matter of receiving Yuguan. The Japanese may not raise the issue of Dongluocheng being assigned to the puppet government again. However, Suizhong County, which belongs to the puppet government, has sent ninety districts to set up offices in Dongluocheng, invisibly submerging its power in the area. Even if the Luocheng issue is not raised in the future, it is already no different from being assigned to the puppet government. Our side is now studying countermeasures to this. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Rugeng said that he is leaving to inspect various counties. The Japanese side has returned the local administration of Gubeikou. However, our security team has not yet arrived. He will personally go to Gubeikou to contact the Japanese military commander to prepare for the implementation of the takeover in January next year. The situation of Zhang Futang's security team stationed in Yutian County has been investigated by Section Chief Huo to find out the truth. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yin Tong has discussed everything with the Ministry of Railways regarding the through traffic incident and went to Shanghai to see Gu Mengyu before coming to Nanjing, saying that the case is very important. He has some principles for through traffic, but Minister Gu believes that direct involvement must be avoided. However, this matter involves mutual cooperation. The closest method now is probably to have the China Travel Agency preside over monetary and ticketing matters, selling joint tickets. When the Beiping-Ningbo train arrives at Shanhaiguan, the inner ticket will be torn off, and the other party will be responsible when the train passes through Shanhaiguan. However, this matter is still being negotiated on three sides. Whether it can be realized immediately must be discussed and settled with the Ministry of Railways before a decision can be made. He will return north in a few days. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Rugeng went to Tianjin to see Yu, returned to Beiping yesterday, and transferred to Tongzhou to inspect the address of the Commissioner's Office. He returned to Beiping that night. It is heard that the office has been arranged and will go to Tongzhou in the next few days to take office. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Beiping Military Branch Holds an Extraordinary Meeting</h3>

To establish a committee to assess military officers above the rank of school officer to review the qualifications of each member. 2. To establish a four-way inspection committee to review the previous inspection report and formulate reform measures. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Military Branch and the Light Supervision Committee decided that the military pay in North China will be paid at 60% starting from January next year. However, due to the complicated and varied military expenses, a meeting will be held on the 16th to discuss and stipulate the detailed items of expenditure. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The seventh military pay for the various armies in North China has not been fully allocated due to the contributions of all parties and is scheduled to be distributed on the 18th. The uniform expenses for the various armies are scheduled to be issued monthly starting in January next year. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chiang Cables Liu Xiang to Urge Deng and Tian to Advance Troops, Wang Lingji Convenes a Meeting of County Magistrates to Discuss and Determine Measures to Blockade Bandit Areas</h3>
<p>(Hankou) Chiang cabled Liu Xiang to urge Deng and Tian to advance troops to attack the bandits, hoping to eliminate them as soon as possible. Wang Lingji convened a meeting of the county magistrates of Jiangkai County and Liangshan on the 12th to discuss and determine measures to blockade the bandit areas and to appease and recover the people in the bandit areas to return to their homes. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Chairman Chiang cabled Liu Xiang on the 9th to urge Deng Xihou and Tian Songyao to advance quickly to attack the Red bandits in order to divide the bandit forces. (15th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Liu Xiang telegraphed orders to the various armies on the 11th that all grains recovered from the bandit areas must be handed over to the Relief Committee or the county magistrate for preservation and distribution. The bandit suppression troops must not take them as their own. All those who come to surrender after opposing the communists, except for those suspected of being bandit spies who are monitored, will be protected without exception.

<h3>Current Affairs Commentary: Thoughts on the Japanese Internal Affairs Conference</h3>
<p>In today's world, transportation is well-developed. The limitations of the ocean and the barrier of mountains have been broken by human efforts. For neighboring countries, whether enemies or friends, it is impossible to completely isolate the economic connections between them. The ebb and flow of politics can easily have an impact. In Europe, the historical problems left over between England, France, Germany, and Italy are not easy to settle, but the closeness of the relationship between them is undeniable. In the Far East, the actual interests of China and Japan are not necessarily all in conflict. However, since the Mukden Incident, national sentiments have been in absolutely opposite positions. Because of this, we should pay special attention to studying all matters related to Japan, first achieving a state of knowing ourselves and knowing our enemy. From the government to the people, Japan is dominated by the military. The tense situation of the so-called extraordinary period has spread throughout Japan. The social unrest and the unease of the people are becoming increasingly apparent due to the excessive expansion of the extraordinary period. Therefore, the so-called strengthening of military preparations, the expansion of the navy, the five-minister conference, and the questions about the budget all show the weakness of the Saito Cabinet and the instability of the entire Japanese nation. Increasing military spending requires expanding the national treasury budget, which has a major impact on Japan's national strength. We observe the facts and analyze them objectively. No matter how vigorously the Japanese militarists advance, their natural resources are very poor. Take iron ore as an example. The total output in Japan is only enough to supply one-tenth of its steelmaking capacity. The same is true for oil. Its so-called heavy industry cannot stand alongside the advanced countries of England, America, and Germany. It is inferior to France and Belgium. Moreover, the increasing agricultural panic within the country is enough to affect the entire nation. Since the outbreak of the world economic panic in 1929, Japan's economic crisis has spread everywhere. Whether in rural villages or cities, everyone is groaning in the suffering of the recession, only because it has a more powerful government and incites an extraordinary period in relation to military affairs, can it cover up the facts of its domestic panic.</p>
<p>Recently, the Japanese authorities have also realized that this cannot continue. The exposure of rural bankruptcy will cause the whole country to fall into tragedy. The lurking of dangerous ideas will increase the unrest in Japanese society. Military control will become increasingly difficult. Therefore, at the Japanese Internal Affairs Conference, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Fumio Goto proposed a concrete plan to revitalize rural villages. The most important part of this plan is to "reform" rural education, cultivate central figures to lead rural villages, and reward model rural groups." We will put aside for now what its true effectiveness will be in the future. However, we still have related thoughts on this.</p>
<p>First, in our country's education, there have been many people who have devoted themselves to learning and worked hard in recent decades, but the effectiveness has not yet been seen. Even those responsible for running education cannot help but lament the vagueness of the future. Why is this? We observe that China has always been a country based on agriculture. Although industry and commerce have developed considerably, it is still an agricultural country as a whole. However, general education has very little to do with rural villages. Therefore, those who have received complete education have completely broken away from their relationship with rural villages. Even those who have received secondary education are unwilling to return to their villages to engage in agriculture. Even if there are some, it is only the efforts of a few people that do not affect the entire rural village. As a result, there is no such thing as education in our country's rural villages. Now, if we want to reform and encourage ourselves in time, we can only create rural education and make education adapt to the needs of rural villages, and then we can gradually have hope.</p>
<p>Second, our country's rural villages are becoming increasingly declining compared to capitalist countries due to the exploitation of foreign economic forces. The political organization and economic turnover in rural villages are mostly controlled by local tyrants and evil gentry. Those with slightly more upright character cannot stand their ground in today's rural villages. Therefore, central figures to lead rural villages are even more urgently needed in China than in Japan. Even if they cannot be obtained immediately, they must be cultivated diligently, hoping for future harvests. As for awarding model groups in rural villages, it is necessary for those engaged in agriculture to organize themselves and cooperate with local politics.</p>
<p>Our country's rural villages are extremely exhausted. Whether it is the reform of education or the reorganization of politics, it is not easy to talk about. Therefore, the fundamental way to save rural villages should not abandon the fundamentals and pursue the superficial, only seeking the construction of higher-level education, but must first start with improving the lives of farmers, increasing agricultural production, and raising the prices of agricultural products. At the same time, it is also necessary to remove political obstacles, eliminate excessive taxes and miscellaneous taxes, and prevent high-interest loans from harming the people. Then, the revival of rural villages is almost possible.</p>
<h3>Sino-British Cooperation: Yan, Gu, and Guo All in London</h3>
<p>(London) Chinese Envoy to the UK, Guo Taiqi, told a Reuters reporter today that last night's banquet by the China Association demonstrated the amity between the people of China and Britain. The discords from 1925 to 1927 have been forgotten, and the current atmosphere is conducive to effective cooperation between the two countries. Yan Huiqing and Gu Weijun are currently staying at Envoy Guo's residence to discuss diplomatic issues for about half a month. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>London China Association Hosts Banquet for New Envoy to China; Embassy Relocation Issue Unresolved</h3>
<p>(London) The London China Association hosted a banquet today for the new British Envoy to China, Sir Meyrick Hewlett.  MacDonough, a director of HSBC London, spoke, elaborating on the importance of the British Envoy residing in Nanjing. Hewlett responded that he had not yet decided where to reside and would only be able to decide after a personal inspection. Chinese Envoy Guo Taiqi said that Hewlett's arrival in China would certainly be met with a warm welcome, and that the Nationalist government in Nanjing, with its internal construction and unification of the country policies, is making quiet and steady progress.  China hopes that British trade and cooperation will play an increasingly important role in this progress. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Debuchi Meets with Hirota to Report on Japanese-American Relations</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Debuchi, the Ambassador to the United States, returned to Japan on the 14th after completing his five-year term. On the afternoon of the 15th, he met with Foreign Minister Hirota, reported on his experiences during his tenure, and presented his views on the United States. The content is as follows: There are widespread rumors that relations between Japan and the United States are perilous and that Japanese-American diplomacy is at a critical juncture. However, there is absolutely no such thing on the American side. The United States is currently working hard to build its domestic economy and does not want to interfere in the affairs of other countries. Although its concern for Far Eastern issues remains significant, the Roosevelt administration's policy toward Manchuria is completely different from that of the Hoover era, and its attitude is quite steady. Furthermore, the American policy of constructing large warships is exaggerated by outsiders. However, the American naval power in 1936 will only reach 80% of the level stipulated by the London Treaty. Japan does not need to be overly sensitive about this. Since the situation in the United States is like this, harmonizing the feelings of Japan and the United States before the 1936 Washington Conference will prevent the conference from breaking down and lead to a reasonable conclusion. It is not too difficult. (United News dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Debuchi Resigns to Hirota</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Ambassador to the United States, Debuchi, who returned to the country yesterday, visited Foreign Minister Hirota at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 1:30 PM today. He reported in detail on the recent political situation in the United States, as well as the industrial recovery plan, the naval construction bill, and the policy toward Japan. After exchanging opinions on future policies toward the United States, he stated his desire to retire bravely. Foreign Minister Hirota understood Ambassador Debuchi's intention and said that he had already internally approved it. (Dentsu dispatch, 15th)</p>

<h3>Numerous Rumors in Dihua</h3>
<p>Sheng Shicai Changes Military Strategy</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Lanzhou states that Dihua received a telegram saying that Ma Zhongying had not entered Dihua.

<h3>Tibetan Troops Continue to Advance Eastward</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Although the central government has instructed the Dalai Lama to stop the Tibetan troops from invading Kang, the Tibetan side is taking advantage of the country's troubles and continues to advance. According to someone who recently returned to Beijing from Xikang, since the Fujian Incident and the occupation of Sichuan Province by the Communist bandits, the central government has no time to look westward. Therefore, it mobilized 10,000 Tibetan troops, concentrated them on the west bank of the Jinsha River, and organized 5,000 lamas from the Da Jin Temple into an army, attempting to create disturbances in the rear as an aid to the invasion of Kang. The Sino-Tibetan Treaty has been discarded like old shoes. In addition, 5,000 Tibetan soldiers have been stationed on the Qinghai border to contain Qinghai troops from providing assistance. Judging from the current situation, if the central government does not quickly order the provincial governments bordering Xikang to strictly guard against this, it will be difficult to cope.

<h3>Reports of Victories in Jiangxi and Hubei Bandit Suppression; Rumors of Luo Binghui's Death</h3>
<p>(Hankou) According to a telegram from Nanchang to the highest military authorities, all routes in the bandit suppression campaign in Jiangxi have achieved major victories. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Zhang Fang telegraphed that he had routed Ma Xiyou's bandits in Nanyang on the 13th. The bandits retreated to Dahetun, Jianlingdian. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The troops stationed in Henan, Hubei, and Anhui recently suppressed the remaining bandits and seized approximately 3,000 guns. Chiang has issued orders for commendations. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>The National Army in Fuzhou achieved a great victory on the front lines in Jiangxi. Chairman Chiang personally commanded the National Army at the front in Nancheng, and after three days of bitter fighting, there was such a great victory. Luo Binghui, the most famous commander-in-chief of the Communist First Army, has already been killed. The National Army has occupied Zixi County. More than 5,000 bandits were killed. On the morning of December 11, the bandit First Army attacked the National Army 90th Division from the south of Yihuang and the west of Guangchang. After a night of fierce fighting, the National Army cut the bandit army into two sections. 800 soldiers in Luo Binghui's bandit army died. As a result, the remaining bandits led their own remnants to surrender to the National Army to show their sincerity. On the 12th of this month, the bandit Third and Fifth Armies, numbering about six brigades, attacked the National Army Fifth, Sixth, and Ninety-Sixth Brigades south of Lichuan. After a day and night of fierce fighting, the bandit army was completely defeated and fled towards Taining. The National Army pursued them and took Dongshan without any effort. In this battle, more than 2,000 bandits were killed. On December 13, the National Army won the final victory. In the past two days, the National Army Fourth and Seventy-Ninth Brigades defeated the bandit Seventh Army, which was the most important militarily, in Zixi County. They occupied the city that evening. Zixi County is the most important base of the bandit army. It is of utmost military importance because it is located on the border of Jiangxi and Zhejiang, with a direct route to Fujian. Around December 14, information was received from the front that Deshengguan (20 li south of Dongshan), which is also of military importance, was occupied by the National Army this afternoon. In these three days, the National Army lost only a small number, a total of just under 400 killed or wounded. The bandit army left behind countless military supplies with each defeat. Military experts believe that in the first three days of battle, the bandit army outnumbered the National Army many times, but they were completely defeated. This was entirely due to Chairman Chiang personally commanding at the front, so the National Army had the courage to kill the enemy. The bandits, after being severely damaged by the National Army this time, are already crestfallen and demoralized, because they know that the final outcome is inevitable. According to the latest report, in the first three days of the battle, the number of wounded bandits was more than twice that of the National Army, estimated to be over 10,000.

<h3>Instability on the Chinese Eastern Railway Intensifies; International Train Derails Twice; Three Hundred Righteous Soldiers Attack from Both Sides; Two Japanese Soldiers and Five Passengers Killed</h3>
<p>(Harbin) At 1:30 AM this morning, three hundred righteous soldiers dismantled the tracks at the Suhai station on the western line of the Chinese Eastern Railway, causing the international train to overturn. They attacked passengers in the chaos and robbed them of money. A large number of passengers were also kidnapped. At that time, Japanese soldiers and armed passengers on the train joined forces to fight back against the righteous soldiers. Because they were outnumbered, two Japanese soldiers and five passengers were killed, and a total of eight people, including Japanese soldiers, were wounded. Upon receiving an urgent report, Ang'angxi urgently dispatched an armored train. It should be able to recover the route tonight. (Dentsu dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>The attack by righteous soldiers on the international train at Suhai Station in Qiqihar has been detailed in the previous telegram. According to Sergeant Matsuda of the cavalry unit riding on the train, the attacking righteous soldiers numbered about 350, and it seemed that Russians were in command. They shouted "Kill all Japanese." When the train overturned, gunfire began from both sides of the train, and looting continued until 5:00 AM on the 15th. Later, some righteous soldiers retreated to the west, while the main force retreated towards Jingxing County. The righteous soldiers were also carrying automatic pistols and two machine guns each. (Dentsu dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) It is learned that in the train robbery case, one Russian, six Chinese, and three Japanese were injured, all civilians.

<p>(Harbin) Last midnight, 300 bandits demolished railway tracks and piled up heavy objects near Tugojia (transliteration), 45 miles west of Qiqihar, causing the eastbound international train to derail and overturn when it arrived there. Then, the bandits opened fire on the train. The small number of guards in the train were unable to resist. The bandits then searched and looted the first and second class carriages, and kidnapped many passengers. It has now been determined that seven passengers were killed and eight were injured. It is still unknown how many injured people have not been found in the broken carriages. At 3:00 AM this morning, Qiqihar sent a Japanese armored train to pursue the bandits and rescue the kidnapped people. There were no British or American passengers in the train. The weather is extremely cold, with a temperature of 50 degrees below zero. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>

<h3>The Disarmament Problem: A Touchstone for the League of Nations; British Organizations Hold Rallies in Support; Lord Robert Cecil and Lord Allen of Hurtwood Both Attend and Speak; Resolution Passed Requiring Government to Draft a Plan; Weapons Forbidden to Germany Should Be Abolished by All Countries Equally</h3>
<p>(London) The Federation of Organizations Supporting the League of Nations held a general meeting this morning, chaired by Viscount Cecil of Chelwood. Lord Allen of Hurtwood, Secretary-General of the League of Nations Union, also attended. Both Allen and Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Eden spoke successively, expressing confidence in the mission and future of the League of Nations. Allen said briefly, "If the League of Nations has the support of British public opinion, we will never be disappointed in its fate." Then Viscount Cecil spoke, saying that he did not believe there was a real danger of war, but when he spoke of the policies pursued by the German government, he found the country's expressions of maintaining peace and justice questionable. Cecil said, "We must make disarmament a success, because the disarmament problem is a touchstone for the success or failure of the League of Nations. Although countries are currently engaged in diplomatic negotiations on this matter, if concrete proposals are not put forward as a basis for discussion, I am afraid that the negotiations will not have any effect." Cecil wants the British government to put forward proposals based on the following points: (1) All weapons that the peace treaty prohibits Germany from possessing should be abolished by other countries within five years. (2) International supervision of armaments; (3) Re-stating the obligations of mutual assistance between countries, with economic sanctions imposed for violations of obligations; (4) International supervision of civil aviation; (5) Creation of an international air force, etc. Finally, the conference passed two resolutions. The first resolution expressed confidence in the League of Nations to avoid war. The second resolution required the British government to draft a plan stipulating three points: (1) All weapons that the peace treaty prohibits Germany from possessing should be abolished by all other countries within a certain period; (2) Limiting military expenditures; (3) Implementing phased reductions in armaments under international supervision. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(London) The Federation of Organizations Supporting the League of Nations held a movement to support the League of Nations. Viscount Cecil of Chelwood and others have given speeches on maintaining the League of Nations. Wickham Steed, the former editor-in-chief of The Times, also recently made a speech in support of this movement. He said, "The League of Nations is the only good organization left over from the European War, and some countries are joining forces to attack it, which is something we cannot condone. If such a large change in the feelings of the general public occurs in these countries, what kind of impact it will have politically cannot be known." Steed also said that once something happens, the people of Germany who have been trained and armed can immediately mobilize millions of people to fight. If we allow them to rearm, the danger would be unthinkable. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>British Ambassadors to France and Germany Return Home to Report on Negotiations</h3>
<p>(London) British Ambassador to France, Sir George Clerk, recently returned to London to communicate the British government's views on disarmament and other League of Nations matters. British Ambassador to Germany, Sir Eric Phipps, also came to London for this matter. After arriving this afternoon, he went to the Foreign Office for a long talk with Foreign Secretary Simon.

<h3>Foreign Secretary Simon to Travel in Europe During Christmas Holiday</h3>
<p>(London) Simon will travel abroad during the Christmas holiday, partly for official business and partly for pleasure. He will first go to Paris, then to Rome, to discuss important matters, and will return to London around January 7 to participate in the work of the Foreign Office, and then go to Geneva to attend the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting on January 15. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Rome Expresses Welcome, Showing Favor Toward Germany</h3>
<p>Several British newspapers in Rome reported that British Foreign Secretary Simon will travel here during Christmas. Although this news has not been confirmed, those who heard it expressed great welcome. As a result of close contact between the Italian government and the British government, the British attitude towards the disarmament problem has changed. Italy still advocates allowing Germany to increase its military quota to 300,000 men. As for the British proposition, it only wants to prevent Germany from engaging in naval construction. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Two Ways to Resolve: France and Germany Conclude Non-Aggression Pact, or Adopt British Plan</h3>
<p>(London) A few days before Foreign Secretary Simon's trip to the continent, The Times published an opinion stating that there are only two ways to resolve the current difficult international situation: (1) France and Germany conclude a non-aggression pact; (2) Adopt the main principles of the British disarmament plan proposed in March of this year. The newspaper's view on the first point is particularly clear. It said, "If we advocate that France and Germany conclude a non-aggression pact, some people will doubt whether a non-aggression pact is sufficient to guarantee peace. If that were the case, the countries of Europe should have been able to rest easy long ago, because most of the countries have already concluded such treaties. In addition, there are more important treaties, such as the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Locarno Treaty, which are not included." We have no shortage of words to answer this skeptical argument. It must be known that the reason why European warfare has not broken out until now is largely due to the restrictions imposed by these treaties. This is one. Secondly, German Chancellor Hitler is a revolutionary who has swept away all previous things. As a person, he respects his promises. Since he has formally declared that he will not fight France, this one sentence is enough to reconcile the feelings of the two nations. At present, the biggest obstacle to the conclusion of a disarmament convention lies in the disagreement between France and Germany. If it can be reconciled, there is no fear that the disarmament problem cannot be solved. The Times also said that the final resolution should still be sought in Geneva, but the reconciliation between France and Germany is the key to the solution. The newspaper has always believed that the demands put forward by the German government are not enough to hinder the success of the British disarmament plan, saying that if we establish a general disarmament convention based on the British plan, we can still achieve the goal. As for the potential of a certain country's people to fight, it is not enough to worry about, because if countries universally adopt a short-term military service system, this potential will lose its importance. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>French and Czech Foreign Ministers' Conversations Strictly Confidential</h3>
<p>(Paris) This afternoon, Czech Foreign Minister Beneš and French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour held talks from 5:00 PM to 6:30 PM. Czech Envoy to France Osuský was also present. Beneš declared to the press, "The content of the talks is confidential and cannot be published. We reviewed various issues related to the general policies of the two countries. We will continue the talks tomorrow afternoon. That is all I can tell you." At 6:30 PM, Premier Daladier received Beneš and had a general discussion on the international political situation, with particular emphasis on issues related to the Czech and French sides. Paul-Boncour is scheduled to meet with Beneš again tomorrow afternoon. It is not known whether a third talk will be held, given the importance of the issues discussed by the two foreign ministers. The matters discussed by the two foreign ministers were (1) the League of Nations and the plan to reform the League; (2) the Disarmament Conference and Germany's demands regarding armaments; (3) the organization plan of the countries of Central Europe and the Danube River Basin, etc. A formal communique will be issued after the talks are concluded. Beneš is scheduled to leave France on Monday next week. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>

<h3>British Aircraft Manufacturing Industry Still Leads the World</h3>
<p>(London) According to a certain magazine, in 1933, Britain still held the top position in the world for aircraft materials and aircraft exports. Among all the aircraft in the world, only those manufactured in Britain could operate independently without subsidies. In 1933, British commercial aircraft flew a total of 2,090,000 miles, carrying 56,683 passengers. This compared to 1,604,000 miles and 25,211 passengers in 1931, clearly demonstrating the progress of British aviation in recent years. As for military aircraft, efforts are being made to achieve higher performance, and the current manufacturing trend pays close attention to bombers. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Unsinkable Speedboat: Indestructible by Aircraft Bombing; Satisfactory Trial Results</h3>
<p>(London) The Daily Telegraph reported today that the first demonstration of an unsinkable speedboat speeding in the North Sea, being attacked by bomber aircraft, was held. The boat was 40 feet long and reached a speed of 30 miles per hour. The aircraft pursued and attacked it, demonstrating amazing skill. Each boat carried three sailors, wearing earmuffs, steel helmets, and gas masks, with minimal other clothing. They lay under unbreakable shelters, steering the boat at high speed, while the aircraft dropped bombs from an altitude of 1,500 feet. Sometimes the bombs hit directly, but the shelters remained intact. The only problem was that fragments from the bombs would hit unprotected wooden parts, penetrating through. In such cases, the sailors had to swim to plug the holes. This trial has been conducted secretly for over a year. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>A Story of the Occupation of Honolulu: Preface by a Naval Officer; Japanese Ship Carries Propaganda to America; Though a Novel, it Predicts a US-Japan War</h3>
<p>Honolulu. After confiscating Japanese propaganda booklets on the ship Chichibu Maru yesterday, important discoveries were made in the booklets today. The book is indeed a novel, but describes in detail the situation when Japan occupied Honolulu during the US-Japan war in 1936. It also has prefaces by senior Japanese naval officers. For example, Admiral Kato, former Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, wrote one of the prefaces, strongly advocating the necessity of Japan's air defense development. In another preface, Vice Admiral Suematsu, the current Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Combined Fleet, stated that although he could not formally comment on the contents of the booklet, if the Japanese army could achieve victory as described, it would be a great pleasure, and offered congratulations to the author. The narrated wartime events began with a dispute between US and Japanese sailors in Shanghai, followed by Japanese warships sinking the flagship Houston of the US Asiatic Fleet outside Wusongkou. Finally, the US aircraft carriers Lexington and Saratoga, along with a large number of aircraft, were defeated by Japanese aircraft, resulting in a complete Japanese victory. The entire book uses the real names of US and Japanese warships and senior officers. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>

<h3>White House Statement: Dollar Devaluation Policy Unchanged; Overseas Gold Purchases to Continue; Pound-Dollar Stabilization Still Distant; Speaker of the House Advocates Free Silver Coinage to Avoid Inflation; Treasury Secretary Woodin Denies Resigning This Year</h3>
<p>(Washington) The White House issued a statement today declaring that the government does not intend to change its monetary policy. This move by the US President indicates that the US government will resume the process of lowering the value of the dollar as soon as possible, with the apparent goal of devaluing the dollar to fifty cents. However, the White House statement did not mention any specific plans for implementing this process. According to President's Secretary Early, gold purchases will soon be resumed. This White House statement is the result of a two-hour meeting this morning between the President and his closest monetary advisors. It guarantees that the United States will not return to the gold standard for the time being, nor has it been in contact with foreign governments to stabilize the dollar. Although Acting Treasury Secretary Morgenthau firmly denied this morning the rumor that the Federal Reserve Bank had reached an agreement with the central banks of Britain and France to stabilize the dollar exchange rate based on the current gold purchase price of $34.01 per ounce, the rumor persisted for a while. Therefore, the White House issued this statement. Before Secretary Early issued the statement, many non-official observers in this area told reporters that they did not believe the government intended to issue irredeemable "greenback" banknotes, but expected the dollar to continue to devalue, possibly to a lower level by early next spring, after which thoroughly sound "gold certificate" banknotes would be issued with adequate reserves as a guarantee to increase currency. In addition, when Early made the statement, Jones, General Manager of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, also announced that the company had purchased 446,000 ounces of newly mined domestic gold to date, and had also allocated 526,000,000 yuan to closed and unopened banks. The purchase of bank stocks has also been progressing rapidly recently, with preferred stock and capital notes of 942 banks purchased to date, amounting to 5,300,000,000 yuan. In addition, the silver movement has also made considerable progress. Today, House Speaker Rainey also told reporters that he supported the establishment of a silver bill after the reopening of Congress, and supported the adoption of bimetallism, but based on a ratio of twenty to one. He said that the words of former Democratic presidential candidate Bryan, that there would be no economic panic and decline when the US currency used both gold and silver as its standard, were an irrefutable truth. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Speaker of the House Rainey told the press that he supported the free coinage of silver, saying that if President Roosevelt proposed such a bill, the House would pass it immediately. "The gold standard we have previously followed will never be seen again in the world." Rainey advocated the re-coinage of silver at a ratio of twenty to one, in order to prevent inflation, saying that if this were done, half of the world would adopt an inflation policy.

<h3>Flourishing Changlu Salt Transportation: Remarks by Transportation Commissioner Wang Zhanghu</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Changlu Transportation Commissioner Wang Zhanghu said that Changlu salt transportation suffered great losses during the war in North China. After the armistice agreement was signed, it has become increasingly prosperous. Currently, the monthly regular tax revenue is about one million yuan, and the surtax is two million yuan, totaling more than three million yuan. Because the vitality of the counties in eastern Luan has not recovered, tax revenue has not returned to its original state. Recently, the influx of smuggled salt has affected tax revenue.

<h3>Jiangxi Province Divided into Eight Blockhouse Zones, Blockade Policy Aims to Annihilate Communists, Constructing Blockhouses to Prevent Communist Movement</h3>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Chairman Chiang attaches the greatest importance to two aspects of the fifth encirclement and suppression plan: constructing blockhouses to prevent Communist movement and blockading Communist-controlled areas. Before the Fujian Incident, all five provinces, except for eastern Hubei with Huangma as its center, regarded the Jiangxi pseudo-First Front Army as the blockade center. The General Headquarters statistics show that over one hundred counties are involved in the blockade. In this province, except for Ningdu, Xingguo, Yudu, Huichang, Shicheng, Guangchang, Yongxin, Hengfeng, and other counties completely occupied by the Communists, and the provincial capital of Jiujiang, blockade organs have been established in all other areas. Kerosene and salt are sold exclusively by the government, and people can only purchase them with permits. Recently, to improve effectiveness, the General Headquarters has also specially assigned one inspector to every two counties. Sun Yongnian and sixteen others have already been announced as inspectors for thirty-two counties including Linchuan. The inspectors for the remaining thirty-plus counties will also be announced shortly. In addition, 104 investigators have been dispatched to various locations to conduct inspections. As for the effectiveness of the blockade, according to reports from various sources and accounts from those who have escaped from Communist-controlled areas, it is indeed sufficient to annihilate the Communists. For example, Guo Shizeng's troops found a notice from the pseudo-Jin'nan Special Zone stating that seventy catties of rice could be exchanged for two catties and four taels of salt. This is the situation in semi-Communist-controlled areas; the situation in fully Communist-controlled areas can be inferred. As the Communist army regards the Nationalist army's blockade policy as a fatal wound, they are making every effort to break it. In addition to secretly infiltrating safe zones to plunder supplies from time to time, they are also using guerrilla tactics to advance and expand along the borders of the Communist-controlled areas towards non-Communist-controlled areas, appearing and disappearing unpredictably, causing great disturbance. Therefore, in addition to the blockade, the power of blockhouses is also needed to prevent their movement. The General Headquarters has divided the Jiangxi area into eight blockhouse zones, each zone with a supervisory commissioner. The commissioners for the first zone is Li Peigang, (2) Liu Yingfu, (3) Li Genyun, (4) Lin Guoguang, (5) Ji Kanyi, (6) Xu Shengyu, (7) Han Deyuan, (8) Yang Quanjing. At the same time, Chiang has also designated over twenty counties including Linchuan in eastern Jiangxi as blockhouse cluster zones. Blockhouses are being constructed around county towns, market towns, and villages. All bridges on roads open to traffic are also being constructed in the same way. The garrison troops are responsible for defending sections to prevent the Communists from destroying transportation. (December 13)</p>

<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Chairman Chiang, in order to quickly restore farmers' livelihoods in the recovered areas of the provinces suppressing bandits, now that the cleansing of the countryside has already begun, has ordered the establishment of utilization cooperatives to handle lending, sub-lending, and land management. All regulations have been formulated and ordered to be effectively implemented in the provinces suppressing bandits. The main measures are: (1) Lending working capital to members, managing members' land, procuring farming and daily necessities, and buying and selling various goods, to achieve the goal of everyone being able to make a living. The original order is as follows: "After the cleansing of the countryside work begins in the recovered counties and districts of the provinces suppressing bandits, rural finance should be immediately rescued and farmers' livelihoods restored, so that the people can live happily and the source of the bandits can be cut off, achieving permanent peace and laying the foundation for the revival of the localities. For this measure, the General Headquarters of the Three Provinces Suppressing Bandits in Henan, Hubei, and Anhui previously formulated and promulgated the Emergency Rural Financial Relief Regulations for Provinces in Bandit Suppression Areas, and the Regulations for Rural Cooperative Preparatory Societies, etc., and ordered them to be implemented. Now, the original Regulations for Rural Cooperative Preparatory Societies in Bandit Suppression Areas are designed exclusively as preparatory work for reorganizing credit cooperatives. Based on years of experience, since the beginning of the recovery of bandit areas, the problems of rural land ownership and tenancy have been quite prominent, requiring unified control and regulation. Because the recovered counties and districts have long been under Communist influence, land has already been affected by land distribution, and class consciousness is particularly evident in tenancy. Now, at the beginning of pacification, all aspects of land distribution and management, changes in tenancy relations, replenishment of farming tools, and all necessary equipment for farming and life must be brought into the cooperative framework to break the old habit of individuals seeking their own livelihood and seek rapid and effective development. Therefore, the organizational form of the cooperative preparatory societies needed in the recovered counties and districts, in addition to credit cooperatives, should also promote utilization cooperatives, so that in addition to handling lending and sub-lending matters, they can also manage land, integrate landowners and tenants, and jointly seek development. In places where rural revitalization committees have not been established in townships and towns, utilization cooperative preparatory societies can also be used to handle various matters prescribed by the land disposal regulations of those townships and towns, so as to coordinate with the situation and avoid delays. Based on this purpose, a simple version of the Rural Utilization Cooperative Preparatory Society is specifically supplemented in plain language and issued along with this order. Hereafter, in all counties within your jurisdiction that have been designated to apply the Emergency Rural Financial Relief Regulations, in addition to handling rural cooperative preparatory societies, utilization cooperative preparatory societies may also be handled in accordance with the newly issued simplified regulations. You must comply with this and forward it to your subordinates for unified compliance. This order." (December 14)</p>
<h3>Tianjin Telephone Bureau Raises Rates, Citing Extremely Difficult Finances and the Need to Pay Interest on Japanese Debt</h3>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: The Tianjin Telephone Bureau has recently sent notices to users informing them that rates will be increased starting January 1 of next year. Businessmen generally believe that at a time when the market is sluggish and business is slow, merchants can hardly bear the increased burden, and are currently planning to oppose it. However, according to the Telephone Bureau, there is a compelling reason for this: In 1926, due to the many inconveniences of manual switchboards, an automatic telephone switchboard was ordered from Siemens in Germany, and a loan of 3 million yuan was obtained from banks such as the Continental Bank, Yien Yieh Commercial Bank, China South Sea Bank, Banque Franco-Chinoise, etc. After the automatic switchboard came into operation, these banks jointly organized a banking syndicate to collect quarterly rentals as collateral, first deducting the interest on the debt, and then returning the remaining amount to the Telephone Bureau to cover all expenses. In the era of manual switchboards, there were approximately 8,000 lines, managed by the General Bureau, East Bureau, South Bureau, and North Bureau. At that time, the monthly rental for businesses was seven yuan, and the monthly rental for households was six yuan, payable quarterly in advance. Later, the General, East, and South Bureaus were converted to automatic switchboards. Also, due to the line configuration of the automatic switchboards, the East Bureau was changed to the Fourth Bureau, the General Bureau was changed to the Second Bureau, and the South Bureau was changed to the Third Bureau. In addition, because the number of automatic lines was insufficient, it was not possible to universally install them within the General Bureau's range. Those belonging to the General Bureau's manual switchboard were named the Fifth Bureau, and the North Bureau was changed to the Sixth Bureau. After the automatic switchboard was implemented, the monthly rental for businesses was changed to ten yuan, and the monthly rental for households was nine yuan. Manual switchboard businesses and households each paid an additional one yuan per month. The Telephone Bureau's monthly income was approximately 120,000 yuan. The monthly income from Tianjin-Shenyang long-distance calls was approximately 30,000 yuan. After deducting the banking syndicate's monthly interest of over 40,000 yuan and the bureau's expenses of 80,000 to 90,000 yuan, the remaining 20,000 to 30,000 yuan was sufficient for purchasing materials and repair costs. Since the September 18th Incident, the propertied class of the Northeast has flocked to Tianjin, and the number of telephone lines has been in short supply. Therefore, 1,000 surplus automatic switchboards were purchased from the Hankou Telephone Bureau, which was still insufficient. However, since the fall of the Northeast, there has been no income from Tianjin-Shenyang long-distance calls, resulting in an annual loss of no less than 200,000 yuan. The bureau's finances have been quite difficult. Rate increases have been repeatedly proposed, but they have not been implemented due to the two disturbances in Tianjin and the turbulent situation. In addition, with the presence of numerous concessions, although the Telephone Bureau is a purely national business, it is difficult to implement anything without first negotiating and coordinating with the concession authorities. The Telephone Bureau once limited the number of calls as a disguised rate increase, but this was not implemented due to the joint opposition of businesses. Therefore, this time's rate increase was first negotiated and coordinated with the leaders of various businesses, and the agreement of the authorities of various concessions was obtained before it could be resolutely decided to implement it on New Year's Day next year. It is anticipated that there will be some minor disturbances, but the leaders of various businesses will surely be able to persuade and guide, and the authorities of various concessions will surely be able to assist, so it should not be a problem. Upon investigation, for those with automatic switchboards, the rate for households will not be increased (still nine yuan per month). Special businesses such as banks, silver shops, money shops, restaurants, hotels, bathhouses, etc., will be increased by four yuan per month (i.e., fourteen yuan). The remaining are ordinary businesses, which will be increased by one yuan per month (i.e., eleven yuan). For those with manual switchboards, the rate for households will not be increased. Special businesses and ordinary businesses will each be increased by one yuan per month (i.e., eight yuan / nine yuan). In addition, the telephone deposit will be changed to a telephone guarantee deposit: 50 yuan per automatic switchboard (main or extension), and 30 yuan per manual switchboard. There are approximately 8,000 automatic switchboards and approximately 3,000 manual switchboards in the city. This rate increase, excluding households, will increase monthly revenue by approximately ten thousand yuan. If viewed superficially, this increase will slightly alleviate the Telephone Bureau's financial difficulties. In reality, the bureau will not receive any of this money. At a certain time, a certain important person borrowed one million yuan from the China-Japan Industrial Company, with a monthly interest rate of one percent. The contract stated that the Tianjin Telephone Bureau would guarantee it. Later, due to the many troubles of the nation, the principal and interest were not secured. Since the September 18th Incident, the Japanese have revealed their ferocious faces and have become increasingly aggressive in their demands for repayment. They finally declared that if this debt was not repaid, they would send troops to occupy the Telephone Bureau (the Telephone General Bureau is very close to the Japanese concession). The Ministry of Communications was forced to allocate and remit 10,000 yuan per month to the Tianjin Telephone Bureau to repay the interest. Therefore, this rate increase is only enough to pay the interest on the Japanese debt, slightly reducing the burden on the Ministry of Communications, and has nothing to do with the Telephone Bureau. However, the relevant parties are tight-lipped about who borrowed this Japanese debt, when it was borrowed, and what it was used for, which is quite strange. (December 13)</p>
<h3>Songjiang Tricycle Kills a Person</h3>
<p>The local tricycles were formerly subject to a small licensing fee by the district office to indicate management. Later, the various tricycle businesses, citing the slump in business, successively closed down, ceasing to pay the fees, but continued to rent out tricycles secretly, so that they could be seen everywhere on the streets. Moreover, some unscrupulous people would deliberately crash into women in the street for fun, causing them to panic and avoid them. As a result, accidents would occur from time to time due to unskilled driving. The other night, a resident of Jiuqu Lane, Shen Huizhang, accompanied his sister to watch a talkie movie. Upon reaching the entrance of the Grand Theater, Shen's sister was violently knocked to the ground by a speeding tricycle. She lost consciousness for a moment, and then began deliriously babbling. Shen Huizhang immediately hired a carriage to transport his sister back to Dr. Li Wangping for treatment. She died of her injuries yesterday. The passenger who caused the accident has been arrested by the Second Precinct and transferred for investigation. After this case occurred, it is heard that the authorities will strictly ban the passage of tricycles to ensure the safety of travelers.</p>
<h3>Change of Police Captain in Jiading County</h3>
<p>The Department of Civil Affairs has appointed Hu Diguang as the police captain of this county. Hu, whose courtesy name is Ziyun, is from Hunan. He came to Jiading on the 11th and did not meet Magistrate Feng when he visited. He stayed at the Nanyang Hotel that night. The outside world was still unaware. It was not until he visited Magistrate Feng again on the 12th and showed the Department of Civil Affairs' order for the suspension of the original police captain, Gao Baozhen, due to a case, that the news was released. Captain Gao, after receiving the order, has scheduled the handover for the 16th.</p>

<h3>Dispute Over Widening of Gong Lane</h3>
<p>The Wuxian County Government's widening of Gong Lane and Qianjiangfang Street in the city has been nearing completion since work began. However, the width of the streets, as stipulated by the Department of Construction, is eight meters for the carriageway and two meters for the sidewalks on both sides. Unexpectedly, the contractor in charge has arbitrarily reduced the width, reducing the carriageway to seven meters. As a result, the local people are very dissatisfied. Yesterday (15th), Wang Ligeng and others submitted a petition to the Department of Construction, requesting that it order the reconstruction to widen the streets to eight meters to maintain traffic, and also requested that the county government's supervisory personnel be punished. It is heard that the Department of Construction has already heard about this matter, so when Qian Tianpeng, director of the technical office, went to the province to apply for this funding the day before, there were no good results.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Uncovers Drug Pill Operation</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Yao Chunjie, deputy captain of the Public Security Bureau's detective team, acting on a confidential report, stated that there was a secret drug pill manufacturing operation set up by Chen Rengen and others in the workshop of Li Fan's house in Changkang Lane near Hanchang Ridge outside Guangfu Gate. He requested that police be dispatched to search the premises. After receiving the report, Yao immediately dispatched more than ten detectives to Changkang Lane to conduct a search. They arrested the main suspect, Chen Rengen, and three others on the spot, along with the landlord, Li Fan. They also found a large quantity of drug pills, Quick Pill, and heroin, etc., worth about 700 or 800 yuan. They were all taken to the bureau and transferred to the county court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Robbery Occurs in the Urban Area</h3>
<p>Chen Anpei, a resident of Yangjian Town, Huaixia City, Eighth District, is in his twenties and comes from a wealthy family. His father, Zhiying, passed away many years ago. His mother, Qiang, is still alive and well. Several years ago, Anpei married a woman named Gong, and they have a son. The family of several people lived a happy life. Several years ago, due to unrest in the countryside, Chen moved to Yingshanhe in the city. This year, he built a building under the Blue Stone Bridge on the embankment in the East Gate and moved in on the second day of the lunar month. Unexpectedly, at about six o'clock in the evening of the 14th, five robbers suddenly came and, after entering the house, two robbers each produced a Mauser pistol, and one robber held a sharp blade, shouting to prevent anyone from making a sound. At that time, Chen's mother, Qiang, in a moment of quick thinking, took advantage of the fact that the robbers were driving the male and female servants into a room and locking them up, sneaking out the door and running wildly towards Huaixiu Bridge in the East Gate, shouting loudly for help. The robbers inside heard the noise and knew that things were not good. Without waiting to rob, three robbers fled in the direction of Huayuan Lane, and two robbers fled in the direction of Yang Hengtai distillery. At this time, the neighbors around had already heard the noise and came out, and seeing the two robbers running wildly, they chased after them together. As a result, one robber was caught on the spot, while the others escaped. Shortly after, Zhou Guangchun, clerk of the East Gate Guard Post, and Hu Wenhua, officer of the Hanxiu Bridge post, arrived at the scene one after another, and escorted the robber to the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau. Commissioner Qin opened the court. The victims, Chen Anpei and Chen Qiang, went to the bureau to prove that the robber was definitely a robber. According to the robber's confession, his name was Liu Weimin, he was 49 years old, and he was from Henan. He had just arrived in Wuxi this morning to visit friends. He denied robbing. Based on the confession, Commissioner Qin believed that since the robber was caught on the spot and identified by the victims, it was inappropriate to allow him to quibble. So he submitted it to the General Public Security Bureau yesterday and transferred it to the County Court for handling.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Cheng Zhuang Accused Again After Release from Prison</h3>
<p>Cheng Zhuang, former district chief of the Fifth Water Police District, and accountant Gao Tong, who had been detained for years, were released on bail after being transferred to the court, and after repeated investigations, it was determined that Cheng et al. had not embezzled anything and were released on bail. Unexpectedly, former patrol officer Hang Yu and others of the Fifth Water Police District separately submitted reports to the Provincial Department of Civil Affairs and the court yesterday, saying that Cheng et al. had been in arrears with the salaries of the official police and other personnel for many days while in office, and had not paid them, and that they had embezzled them for their own benefit. They requested a thorough investigation and ordered them to be paid.</p>
<h3>Changshu Teenager Murders Aunt</h3>
<p>Gong Pinru, who opened Daheng Xie Silk Shop in Dongtang Town, Third District, married Ni and had two daughters, the eldest named Cuiyuan, who is now twelve years old. Gong's family also includes his old mother and nephew, etc. The nephew is named Xingbao, and is now seventeen years old. His father died eleven years ago. He was usually raised by his grandmother, who loved him very much. He graduated from Dongtang City Primary School and then studied at the Rural Normal School, but dropped out halfway because he was unwilling to endure hardship. However, his aunt strictly disciplined him, and Xingbao hated her deeply. His neighbor, Shao Xinlian, an apprentice at Hengfeng Shun Cloth Shop, is extremely friendly with Xingbao, and their friendship is like brothers. On the 13th of this month, the two secretly agreed to murder their aunt, Ni. On that day, Pinru and his grandmother were not at home. The two drank yellow wine until late at night, and then quietly took a knife and entered their aunt's room. They opened the mosquito net and slashed. At that time, Ni was fast asleep and woke up from her dream. She was struck in the lower back, and a knife was chopped into her right shoulder, and blood flowed freely. Her daughter, Cuiyuan, heard the noise and got up to look, and her nose was also cut off. Seeing that their plan had been achieved, the two teenagers abandoned their knives and went away. Afterwards, five letters were found in Xingbao's room, all addressed to his friends, detailing the process of the murder. The two victims have been sent to the Yuhe Hospital in the city. Their lives are in danger. Their family members are now searching for the whereabouts of the two murderers for investigation.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou Zhenyang Automobile Company's Dispute Over Driver Examinations</h3>
<p>In order to improve its operations, the Zhenyang Automobile Company specially examined the skills of its drivers on the 13th, so that the better ones could drive small cars. This is because passengers in small cars often reward drivers with a considerable tip in addition to the fare. This extra income is not available when driving large cars. The company originally implemented a method of fairness, whereby all drivers could take turns driving small cars a certain number of times each month, so that all drivers could have extra income. This method has been in place for several years. Recently, the company felt that no one was responsible for the damage and loss of parts on the cars. Whenever the company inquired, everyone would shirk responsibility. Therefore, the company believed that it was necessary to make proper regulations, hence the examination. However, the drivers believed that large cars have a large number of passengers, and their driving responsibility is twice as important as that of small cars. Why should they pay special attention to small cars? Moreover, most of the drivers have been serving for many years, and the company has long known the quality of their skills. The company has the freedom to dispose of it, why do you have to take this step, trampling on the workers? Therefore, the union chairman, Zhou Jinbang, was publicly promoted to represent the refusal to take the exam. The company did not allow it, and Zhou was fired. Upon hearing the news, the union convened a board of supervisors under the guise of the county party department, expressed its dissatisfaction, and discussed the methods to deal with it.</p>
<h3>Nantong Kidnapping Ring Leader Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>He Tinggui, the famous kidnapping ring leader in Tonghai, committed numerous crimes. He was arrested by the police and the security forces and sent to the county government for interrogation. He pleaded guilty and has been sentenced to death. His accomplices, Yu Zhoufu and Ding Zikui, have also been arrested by the Public Security Bureau and sent to the court. They have all been tried and sentenced to death.</p>
<h3>Robbery Occurs in Jiaxing Third District</h3>
<p>At about 10 pm the other night, more than a dozen robbers with local accents suddenly came to the house of Cao Jincai, a farmer in Wanjiabang, Datianxu, Shisi Li, Luoxie Township, Third District of Jiaxing, broke down the door and entered, holding weapons, shouted to prevent any sound, and searched and looted at will. After about two hours, they left with their plunder. After inspection, the stolen clothes, ornaments, and other items caused a great loss.</p>
<h3>Cracking Down on Human Trafficking Organizations</h3>
<p>The Jiaxing County Public Security Bureau received a report stating that Zhang Erbao's house in Jiaoli Street was hiding abducted children with the intention of selling them. They immediately ordered the police to search the house. They arrested Zhang Erbao on the spot and rescued two abducted boys, Pan Zhenbao (20 years old, a road intermediary) and Fei Fuzhen (12 years old, from Chongde). The human trafficker, Tang Youzhen, had already fled after hearing the news, and had taken with him a 15-year-old girl who had been abducted. Zhang Erbao and the two boys, Pan and Fei, have been sent to the court for questioning and handling.</p>
<h3>New Pinghu County Magistrate Takes Office</h3>
<p>After Zhang Qingze, the county magistrate of Mu County, was dismissed by order, Zhang Zhouwen, the county magistrate of Xiangshan County, was transferred by the province to take over. Yesterday, the new county magistrate came to Ping, bringing more than thirty people with him. He stayed at the Tongan Hotel in Xiaojie. He has scheduled to take over the seal at 3 pm today. Except for the two staff members in charge of politics and construction, all other personnel in the old county government have resigned.</p>
<h3>Mingguang Forty Li Bridge Captured by Bandits</h3>
<p>Forty Li Bridge Town, east of Lingyi County, was captured by the bandit leaders Hu Si and Xiao Lu and their gang of more than 300 people the day before yesterday (9th). They looted for a day and a night, kidnapped more than 70 people, and the burning and killing were extremely tragic, an unprecedented catastrophe.</p>
<h3>Letter Received</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Letter Addressed Directly: Previously, I read in the Telecommunications column of your newspaper on November 2 of this year, a section on the Guangdong Provincial Department of Construction announcing the method of making paper from mulberry leaves. I was very surprised to read it. The Guangdong Provincial Department of Construction did not announce the method of making paper from mulberry leaves. Only our Bureau recently intended to use mulberry branches to make paper, and is now submitting a report to the Department for filing and implementing a pilot test. The method has not yet been announced. The mulberry leaves mentioned in your newspaper must be a mistake for mulberry branches. After reporting the situation to the Department for review, I was instructed to send a factual letter to your newspaper as soon as possible to make corrections, so as to show the truth. I hereby send this letter for your reference and hope that you will make corrections to show the truth. To the comradely friendship, this is addressed to the Editorial Department of Shanghai Shen Bao, Silk Improvement Bureau of Guangdong Provincial Department of Construction</p>

He arrived in Shanghai at 7:30 yesterday morning on a night express train from Beijing. Accompanying the French Minister was Mr. Honorat, the former French Minister of Education and current Senator. The French Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. Meyrier, and Consul Mr. Gauthier, and others went to welcome them. After getting off the train, Mr. Wilden took a car that was waiting for him and went directly to the French Consulate on Rue du Consulat for a rest. All French expatriates in Shanghai held a public banquet at the French Chamber of Commerce yesterday at noon. Chinese committee member Li Shizeng held a grand tea party at Ferguson Road at 6 o'clock yesterday to bid farewell. Last night at 7 o'clock, French Consul-General Meyrier hosted a farewell banquet at the Consulate, and important French military and political figures staying in Shanghai at the time were invited to attend. In order to save time and avoid having to say goodbye to everyone and decline those who wished to see him off at the pier, Mr. Wilden has decided to hold a farewell reception at the French Consulate at 1:30 this afternoon (the 16th). All French expatriates staying in Shanghai and officials from our government can attend at that time. At 3 o'clock in the afternoon, Mr. Wilden, accompanied by his wife and French Senator Honorat, will leave Shanghai on the French mail ship Laussac to return to his country.

At 6 o'clock last night, three groups, including the World Society, World College, and Sino-French University, held a farewell meeting. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<h3>Friendship Association Banquet</h3>
<p>The figures present yesterday included Chinese committee members Cai Yuanpei and Li Shizeng, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Chu Minyi, former Chinese Minister to France Qian Xinzhi, former Chargé d'Affaires to Belgium Xie Shou Kang, President of the Sino-French Friendship Association Wang Jingqi, Secretary Jiang Wenxin, Directors Li Xinyang, Song Wusheng, Wei Yu, French Consul-General Meyrier, Consul Gauthier, French Police Inspector Fabre, Director of the Education Department of the French Municipal Council Colbert, French Chargé d'Affaires Aubaret, President of the French Literary Association Liu Hong, Secretary Lin Jun, President of Aurora University Qian Ermen, and guests Yang Yannian, Hu Guocheng, Hu Wunyao, Nong Ruhui, Ji Zongmeng, Ms. Huang Mingmin, Ms. Wang Ximing, and more than two hundred reporters from Chinese and Western newspapers.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Venue</h3>
<p>The venue was the French Chamber of Commerce on Avenue Mercier. The French police specially dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to guard the entrance. President of the Sino-French Friendship Association Wang Jingqi, Vice President Colbert, and Secretary Jiang Wenxin, among others, personally acted as hosts. Guests were required to sign in upon arrival. The banquet was held in the large living room on the second floor. French flags were hung on all four walls. The long rectangular table against the wall was for the French Minister and the former French Minister of Education. There were more than ten other circular tables, with the central area reserved for reporters from Chinese and Western newspapers. French Minister Wilden and former French Minister of Education Honorat arrived at the venue around 12 o'clock. Guests entered the venue one after another according to their assigned seats. The venue was solemnly decorated, and the atmosphere was enthusiastic, truly a grand occasion unprecedented.</p>
<h3>Mr. Wang's Congratulatory Speech</h3>
<p>During the banquet, Mr. Wang Jingqi, President of the Sino-French Friendship Association, delivered a congratulatory speech, stating briefly: "Today, the Sino-French Friendship Association is holding a celebration and luncheon to commemorate its establishment. It is a great honor to have French Minister Wilden, who is taking leave from Shanghai, and former French Minister of Education Honorat, who is passing through Shanghai on his way back to his country, invited to attend. The cultural relationship between China and France has a long history. In order to strengthen the ties between Chinese and French people and facilitate cultural exchange between the two countries, the Sino-French Friendship Association was established. Today, there are more than two hundred members present, making this the Association's first grand gathering. With the presence and guidance of Mr. Cai, Mr. Li, and others, we foresee boundless hope for the future. French Minister Wilden is scheduled to return to his country tomorrow. We wish him a smooth journey and hope that he will return to China soon to preside over the friendship between China and France."</p>
<h3>French Minister's Reply</h3>
<p>French Minister Wilden then replied, stating briefly: "I am very grateful for today's banquet. I have been in China for thirty-five years. Although I am temporarily returning to my country, I am reluctant to leave China. However, before leaving China, I attended the groundbreaking ceremony for the Sino-French Friendship Association in Nanjing yesterday, and today I am attending the celebration of the establishment of the Sino-French Friendship Association. I find it very interesting. This association is an organization for strengthening Sino-French relations. I hope that China and France will understand each other, be open and honest with each other, and have no secrets, so that we can avoid misunderstandings. I am very willing to do my best to help the Sino-French Friendship Association and promote it in France after I return to my country."</p>
<h3>Mr. Honorat's Reply</h3>
<p>Next, former French Minister of Education Honorat replied, stating briefly: "I have always been very close to Chinese culture. I co-founded the Sino-French University in Lyon with Mr. Li Shizeng to promote Sino-French cultural exchange. During this visit to China, I saw that the Chinese countryside has vast lands suitable for agricultural products, and its future development is limitless. I am very grateful to be attending this grand gathering today. I wish everyone success."</p>
<h3>Public Lecture</h3>
<p>At the invitation of the French Literary Association, Mr. Honorat gave a public lecture at 5:30 yesterday afternoon in the grand auditorium of the Association at 11 Rue du Consulat. More than five hundred Chinese and French people attended. The lecture was introduced by Mr. Lihong, President of the French Literary Association. Mr. Honorat is currently the Rector of the University District of Paris. The topic of the lecture was the University District of Paris. A reporter from the Shanghai News Agency has extracted and recorded his speech as follows: Mr. Honorat said that the University District of Paris is a district for university students from all countries. It is a French plan from eight years ago. The preparation has cost 300 million pounds so far. Universities from various countries have already built there. The purpose of building the University District is to gather university students from various countries in one place, so that they can gradually eliminate national concepts, remove boundaries between each other, and seek the assimilation of the world. Therefore, this matter is not a French undertaking, but an international undertaking. France originally only has nationality but no ethnicity, so there is no concept of ethnicity. He hopes that the University District will develop day by day, so that all ethnic groups in the world can cooperate together.</p>
<h3>Three Groups Farewell</h3>
<p>The World Society, World College, and Sino-French University held a meeting at 6 o'clock yesterday afternoon at the Society on Ferguson Road to bid farewell to French Minister Wilden and French Minister of Education Honorat. French Consul Meyrier, Cai Yuanpei, Zhang Jingjiang, Wu Tiecheng, Chu Minyi, Zhang Xiaolin, Du Yuesheng, Ye Yuhu, Wang Shisun, Wu Yunzhai, Chen Zeqing, and more than two hundred others attended, making it a grand occasion. Mr. Li Shizeng delivered a speech on behalf of the group, stating briefly that Mr. Wilden and Mr. Honorat have enthusiastically promoted the cause of Sino-French cultural cooperation, and now that they are returning to their country, he would like to express his farewell on behalf of the group. He also said that Mr. Honorat is the advocate of the cultural city, and he himself will go to Europe soon to discuss the progress of this work with Mr. Honorat to promote the development of cultural cooperation between China and France and between China and the international community. Then, Mr. Wilden and Mr. Honorat expressed their gratitude, praising Mr. Li's dedication to international cultural work and hoping that he would come to France soon. Mr. Li led them on a tour, and at the end, the Datong Music Society performed national music. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves and dispersed when the clock struck eight.</p>
<h3>Returning Home Today</h3>
<p>French Minister Wilden is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the French mail ship Laussac with his wife and Mr. Honorat at 3 o'clock this afternoon to return to his country. Mr. Wilden is 57 years old and came to China at the age of 23. He initially worked on the Chinese railway and then became a diplomat. In 1928, he took over as the French Minister to China, and has been in office for five years. He has a very harmonious relationship with China and France. This time, he is taking leave to return to his country for a period of six months, and is expected to come to China to cancel his leave around June next year.

<h3>Kong Xiangxi Came to Shanghai to Discuss the Ministry of Finance's Rectification of Land Tax; It is Proposed to Submit it at the Fourth Plenary Session; The Imposition of Inheritance Tax is in the Planning Stage</h3>
<p>Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi arrived in Shanghai on a night train from Beijing at 7:30 yesterday morning. After getting off the train, he went directly to his private residence on Avenue Petain for a rest. At 11 o'clock, he met with reporters from various newspapers to give a speech. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Proposes to Rectify Land Tax</h3>
<p>In response to questions from reporters, Mr. Kong first stated that at this Fourth Plenary Session, he will represent the Ministry of Finance with a proposal to rectify land tax. The land tax in various provinces is so complicated that it is difficult to describe. Some have little land but heavy taxes, some have much land but light taxes, and some even have land but no taxes. Since the abolition of Likin, various provinces have lost a source of financial revenue, so they have thought about the people (farmers) and created various names to compensate for the land tax. According to my recent investigation, although the methods of collection in various provinces are different, their purpose of levying is the same. For example, the province levies it, the county levies it, the local levies it, and even the garrison levies it. There are so-called "educational surcharges" and "defense surcharges," etc., with more than thirty kinds of names. Especially in Sichuan, it is heard that land tax has been levied for more than fifty years since the Republic of China. Such layers of harsh levy have led to the bankruptcy of the countryside, and the people are struggling to survive. Farmers work hard all year round, but they cannot even eat their fill, so they take risks, and bandits rise up. Land tax originally falls under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance. In order to eliminate accumulated malpractices and provide relief, so that farmers can breathe a little, I have specially proposed the case of land tax rectification at this plenary session to arouse the attention of all members and discuss rectification methods together.</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Postponement of the Fourth Plenary Session</h3>
<p>Mr. Kong also said that the Central Committee has dispatched Zhang Ji, Ma Chaojun, Chen Zhaoying, and Wang Luyi to the south. Their task is to urge the members in the southwest to come to Beijing to attend the Fourth Plenary Session. However, the Fourth Plenary Session was originally scheduled to be convened in Beijing on December 20. Now that the meeting date is approaching, the members who went to Guangzhou to urge the southwestern members to come to Beijing have just arrived in Guangdong. It is difficult for the members to arrive in advance, so it has been decided to postpone it for one month so that the members can come to Beijing to attend the meeting at ease. The rumor that the postponement of the Fourth Plenary Session is to wait for the members such as Zhang Ji to return to Beijing to report is not true. As for whether Mr. Hu Zhantang can come to Beijing, there is no news so far.</p>
<h3>Opening up Political Power Must Go Through Tutelage</h3>
<p>A Hong Kong telegram reported that Chairman Chiang sent a telegram to the southwest, expressing his agreement with the idea of opening up political power. When reporters asked Mr. Kong about this, he said that the "National" in the Kuomintang means the party of the people. Anyone who is a citizen can join. After joining the party, after the period of tutelage, they will have the right to vote and be elected. Before the Kuomintang has thoroughly completed the work of tutelage, for the sake of the country and the nation, it is not allowed to abdicate its responsibility. It must wait until the work of tutelage is completed and the people have the ability to enact a constitution before the period of tutelage can be ended and constitutional government can be implemented. It is not yet time to talk about "opening up political power." If you want to have political power, as long as you do not betray the party's ideology and resolutely follow the teachings of the Premier and join the Kuomintang, you can have political power at any time. Moreover, in the past and present, there are also many non-Kuomintang members who have obtained political power. For example, many ministers and committee members of the government are not Kuomintang members. This can be said that the Kuomintang has never truly implemented the so-called "dictatorship" and has already given political power to people outside the party.</p>
<h3>The Imposition of Inheritance Tax is in the Planning Stage</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance is still planning to collect inheritance tax. As for the import tax on foreign rice and wheat, it has been decided to implement the collection from the 16th. However, Guangdong and Guangxi provinces have always been rice ports, and the people's food depends on foreign rice and wheat. At the same time, the authorities in these provinces have also levied a business tax of one yuan per dan on foreign rice and wheat, so it has been decided to exempt the collection to maintain the people's food. The only purpose of levying import tax on foreign rice and wheat is to protect domestic rice and wheat. Therefore, if in the future a certain province does not have enough rice and wheat to feed its people, then the import tax on foreign rice and wheat should also be exempted to make up for it.</p>
<h3>American Instructor of the Aviation School, Mr. Dier, was Injured and Came to Shanghai for Medical Treatment; An Accident Occurred During a Night Flight at 6:30 the Night Before; He was Sent to Hongren Hospital by Car That Night</h3>
<p>The Continental News reported that Mr. Dier, an American instructor at the Kuanqiao Central Aviation School, was injured in a flight at the Kuanqiao Airport last night (the 14th). In addition to injuring his right cheekbone and jawbone, he also lost six teeth. He was transported to Shanghai by car by his colleague Mr. Sansborg at around 11 o'clock last night and admitted to Hongren Hospital for treatment. It is heard that the accident occurred at 6:30 last night. Mr. Dier and a Chinese student were flying a training plane, teaching the art of night flight. Unfortunately, when landing, it suddenly hit the ground, and the momentum caused Mr. Dier to hit the fuselage, injuring his cheek. The student who was riding with him was not injured, and the plane was unharmed. When Mrs. Pan Lai of this city received a long-distance call from Mr. Sansborg, she pre-invited doctors and dentists, and when Mr. Dier arrived at the hospital, he was immediately treated.</p>
<h3>The National Goods Sports Meeting of the Special Zone Opened Yesterday; Representatives from All Walks of Life Numbered Over 300; A Declaration was Issued to Encourage the Promotion of National Goods; The National Goods Market will Begin Exhibition Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Zone National Goods Sports Meeting, sponsored by the National Goods Manufacturers Association of this city, was held at the Guanghua Theater on Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch at 10 o'clock yesterday morning. The exhibition hall and temporary market for national goods manufacturers' products were changed to be opened at the site of the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association at 9 o'clock this morning due to rain and insufficient arrangements. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<h3>Representatives Present</h3>
<p>The representatives present included Director of the International Trade Bureau He Bingxian, Director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Wu Xingya (represented by Wu Hengru), Lin Kanghou of the Bankers Association, Wang Yansong of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Zhang Yichen and Chen Binghui of the First Special Zone Citizens Association, Mao Yun of the Second Special Zone Citizens Association, and representatives from various factories such as Guanshengyuan, Dongya Woolen Mill, and Yabuer Electric Factory, totaling about 300 people.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>After the ceremonial rites, Cao Zhigong was publicly elected by the presidium to report, stating briefly that the association is holding the opening ceremony today in the wind and rain, and we are grateful to all of you for braving the rain to attend, which shows the enthusiasm of all walks of life for the national goods movement. I would like to thank you on behalf of the association. As for the motivation of the association to hold this event, it is because we feel that the special zone concession is filled with foreign goods, but in the past two years, although there are national goods stores opened in the central area with a relatively large scale, the western area is located in a remote place, and national goods stores are almost non-existent. Therefore, the association specially led employees and factories to hold the national goods sports meeting here, in order to arouse the citizens' deep impression of the national goods movement. We hope that all walks of life and citizens will criticize and purchase as much as possible. We must know that the special zone is subject to the control of the environment and is in a precarious situation, but we must break through all difficulties and see the blue sky and white sun again, so that the national goods movement can achieve the final victory.</p>
<h3>Summary of Speeches</h3>
<p>After the chairman finished his report, Director of the International Trade Bureau He Bingxian gave a speech, stating briefly that today, China's commerce is declining, and all economic organizations are on the verge of bankruptcy. The main reason is that the number of imports is increasing day by day, and the number of exports is decreasing. At present, the only way to remedy this is for the Chinese people to work hard to promote national goods, for various factories to improve their products, and for the Chinese people to be happy to purchase national goods, then foreign goods will naturally decrease, and perhaps we can recover from this situation. Then, Wu Huanru, the representative of the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, gave a speech, stating that in recent years, foreign goods have been rampant, and China's markets have been doing their best to dump, which has led to a slump in Chinese commerce. This is one of the reasons for China's poverty. Furthermore, since the loss of the four northeastern provinces, our country's exports have decreased even more, while imports have increased day by day. The amount of leakage is truly shocking. If we do not find a way to remedy this, the future is unimaginable. I have seen the enthusiasm of the Japanese for using national goods and admire it very much. The people are determined not to use foreign goods and to purchase as much domestic goods as possible. I deeply hope that the Chinese people will follow suit. Wang Yansong, Lin Kanghou, and others also gave speeches in succession, with many warnings. The speeches were too long to be recorded in detail.</p>
<h3>Declaration</h3>
<p>The association issued a declaration stating that the most difficult and unsolvable problem in the world is the economic problem. Since the conclusion of the Treaty of Versailles, the military struggle between countries has temporarily ceased on the surface, and economic competition has emerged. The strength of a country does not lie in the strength of its military force, but in the fullness or emptiness of its national power. Those who have mass production and can be self-sufficient and provide for others will inevitably be strong and rich. Therefore, those in power today pay attention to promoting production, cultivating the foundation of the country, and using dumping policies to build strong tariff barriers in order to seek self-improvement. The economy is related to the country like blood vessels are to the human body. Our country's economic system has always been perfect. A family of eight living in a five-acre house was a beautiful thing in ancient times. Since the opening of the sea ban, the Chinese people have been confused by the novelty of foreign goods and have been buying them one after another. Over the years, it has become a habit, resulting in a daily increase in the import of foreign goods and the outflow of money, which is more than just a million. Taking the past two years as an example, according to the statistics of the International Trade Bureau from January to September, the trade deficit was 2,560,802,814 yuan. The amount of leakage is truly shocking. If this continues, the economy will go bankrupt and the nation will perish. Shanghai is an area for dumping foreign goods. People are accustomed to luxury and value foreign goods, especially in the special zone. In view of this, the association has led its employees and factories to hold this meeting, gathering the essence of national goods from all over the country in one place to meet the world, so that compatriots across the country have the opportunity to recognize national goods. Although the scale is not grand, it has done its best to collect as much as possible. We hope that from now on, people from all walks of life, whenever they need something, will only use national goods, so that production and sales can be integrated into one, and the national economy and people's livelihood will benefit both. This is our declaration.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Slogans</h3>
<p>(1) Promoting national goods is the duty of the people. (2) Promoting national goods is a weapon against insults. (3) Promoting national goods is resisting the enemy. (4) Promoting national goods is realizing the Premier's Principle of People's Livelihood. (5) I am Chinese, I should use Chinese goods. (6) National goods save the country is the Premier's legacy. (7) Use national goods for everything you need for clothing, food, and housing. (8) Using national goods expresses the spirit of the Chinese nation.</p>
<h3>Opening Today</h3>
<p>The exhibition hall and temporary market of the association's factories were originally scheduled to open yesterday, but due to rain, the arrangement of various departments was not completed in time, so the opening was changed to 9 o'clock this morning at the new site of the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association on Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch. All are welcome to visit and purchase as much as possible.</p>

<h3>Import Tax on Foreign Rice and Wheat to be Levied from Today; The Result of Past Awards for Imports Was Low Grain Prices and Injured Farmers; Levying Import Tax Opens the First Page of the History of People's Food</h3>
<p>According to the Shin Shi News Agency's report from this city, the Ministry of Finance has ordered all customs in the country, except for Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian, to levy import tax on foreign rice and wheat, and has decided to start levying it from today. In the past, in order to take care of the people's food, the government adopted a policy of "prohibiting exports and rewarding imports," and there were no taxes on the import of foreign rice and wheat. Now, due to changes in the environment and the needs of reality, we have to change the traditional policy to "opening up exports and restricting imports." The Shin Shi News Agency reporter believes that today is one of the most memorable days for reforming the people's food problem. The levy situation and the past import situation of foreign rice are explored and recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Rice and Wheat Tax Rates</h3>
<p>The import tax on foreign rice has been clearly stipulated in the Ministry of Finance's decree yesterday. However, foreign goods are usually subject to an additional tax of one-tenth. This additional tax was originally caused by disaster relief and has been followed to this day and has not been canceled. Imported rice and wheat are also a kind of foreign goods and cannot be an exception. The tax rates of the principal and additional taxes are converted into national currency as follows: (1) Rice: each dan (calculated as 100 catties, equivalent to 605/1000 of the old customs balance, the same below), 1.00 gold unit, plus 1/10 of the additional tax, a total of 1.10 gold unit, equivalent to 1 yuan, 9 jiao, 8 fen, 5 li in national currency. (2) Grain: each dan 0.50 gold unit, plus 1/10 of the additional tax, a total of 0.55 gold unit, equivalent to 1 yuan, 4 fen in national currency. (3) Wheat: each dan 0.30 gold unit, plus 1/10 of the additional tax, a total of 0.33 gold unit, equivalent to 6 jiao, 2 fen, 5 li in national currency. (4) Flour: each dan 0.75 gold unit, plus 1/10 of the additional tax, a total of 0.825 gold unit, equivalent to 1 yuan, 5 jiao, 6 fen, 4 li in national currency. (5) Other miscellaneous grains: in addition to levying an ad valorem tax of 10%, an additional tax of 1/10 must also be added (the price of the gold unit is based on the Central Bank's market price yesterday).</p>
<h3>Secret Order from the Ministry of Finance for Implementation</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance was deeply concerned that the issuance of this tax order would affect the market, so it was implemented by secret order. The matter was very secret beforehand. The Customs Administration and the General Inspectorate of Customs received the secret order on the 10th, and only on the afternoon of the 13th did they jointly send a telegram to the customs across the country (excluding Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian), requiring them to start collecting taxes on the 16th (that is, today). At the same time, the Jianghai Customs was notified by telephone to comply. After receiving the telephone order, the Customs completed the Chinese and English announcements within one hour and distributed them to various newspapers for announcement. Therefore, on the 14th, various Chinese and foreign newspapers in this city published the Jianghai Customs' announcement on the collection of import tax on foreign rice and wheat. The Customs Administration also instructed the relevant departments on the 14th to be informed.</p>
<h3>Recent Import Statistics</h3>
<p>The government has always tried its best to encourage the import of food in order to stabilize domestic market prices. For example, in the third year of the Yongzheng era, Siam was allowed to transport rice to China. In the sixtieth year of the Kangxi era, an edict was issued to Siam to transport rice to Fujian, Guangdong, Ningbo, and other places for sale, and taxes were exempted. During the Qianlong, Jiaqing, and Daoguang eras, there were also similar awards, but there are no statistics on how much was imported, but the amount should not be small. Since the sixth year of the Tongzhi era of the Qing Dynasty, there have been imports every year. According to customs statistics, by August of this year, 413 million dan of foreign rice had been imported in 73 years. The above statistics show that the most was in 1923, about 22.4 million dan. This year may exceed the number of 1923. This huge leak is the result of the awards given by previous generations. If we do not urgently seek remedies, the future is unimaginable.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Telegram to the Central Government</h3>
<p>The Flour Mill Association of this city agrees with the rice and wheat tax, but the American wheat that has been ordered for various ships was originally the goods underwritten by the central government, and the goods were ordered in advance, so they cannot bear this heavy tax. In the past two days, continuous meetings have been held at the New Kai River Vocational Association and the Bank Club to discuss remedies. It was decided to request the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to forward a telegram to the central government to exempt the import tax on the American wheat that has been ordered but not yet arrived. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce agreed to send a telegram to the central government, requesting an exemption. The original telegram said: To the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, and Customs Administration: According to a letter from the Flour Mill Association, various factories have to use foreign wheat because domestic wheat is insufficient. They have ordered nine ships from the American Wheat Affairs Office and one ship from Canada, Australia, the United States, etc., for a total of ten ships. All have been registered with the Social Affairs Bureau and have been dumped. Now that the Ministry of Finance is collecting foreign wheat tax in advance, each 100 catties, including additional tax, costs about 7 jiao in national currency, and each bag of flour costs about 3 jiao. At a time when grain prices are low, flour prices cannot be increased according to the tax rate, and the losses suffered cannot be compensated. Please telegram the department to exempt the foreign wheat ordered by various factories before the tax rules were announced from taxation in order to protect the factory capital. We hereby telegraph to you and ask for your approval. Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3>City Land Bureau Announces Winter Grain Tax Collection Starting Today</h3>
<p>The City Land Bureau yesterday issued a proclamation regarding the collection of the twenty-second year winter grain tax, stating in brief: The twenty-second year grain tax, reed tax, Jinshan assistance transport, garrison rent, etc., will be collected starting December 16th. For the Zhenru district, due to the autumn disaster of the twenty-first year, a reduction of 0.05 will be applied, resulting in an actual collection of 0.95. The remaining districts will continue to collect at the old rate. The assessment documents will detail this information. The deadline for payment is two months from the start of collection, expiring on February 15th of the twenty-third year. Those who fail to pay by the deadline will be subject to an additional 0.05 tax, with a continued deadline for two more months, expiring on April 15th. Failure to pay by this deadline will result in an additional 0.1 tax, as a penalty for delay.</p>
<h3>Real Estate Association Resolves Tenants to Handle Water Bills, Sends Letter to Public Works Bureau and Water Company with Important Demands</h3>
<p>The city's Real Estate Association convened a general membership meeting yesterday at 5 PM to discuss water cut-off disputes and well-drilling plans. Over forty members were present. The meeting was chaired by Kui Yanfang and resolved eight key issues. Letters were sent to the Public Works Bureau and the water company to request correction of water fees. Details are provided below:</p>
<h3>Attending Representatives</h3>
<p>Hong Xianting of Yide Company, Zhou Wende of Hengyu, Fang Yongyu of Xutongji, Zhuang Yisun of Meiyiji, Shen Weilin of Jiuxing, Gao Zairu of Guixing, Zhao Wenyu of Chengbao, Mu Wenkuan of Dongyu, Yu Shi'an of Longzhang, Yu Pengling of Taojinji, Kui Yanfang of Taili, Jin Hongtao of Tianren, Chen Binggang of Zhenyisanyi, Ye Qiyu of Yeguang, Dong Shusen of Qiu Cheng Qitang, Shen Huada of Fan Rulin, Cao Wenbao, Sun Shensheng of Qingji, Ji Xuan of Dalu, Li Songquan of Deli, Bao Yongquan of Gu Lanji, and over forty other people.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>Chairman Kui Yanfang reported that the significance of today's meeting is profound. First, our industry must unite in the current environment. The water fee dispute is in its final five minutes. Since the beginning of April this year, the Public Works Bureau of the International Settlement decided to implement a tiered pricing system for the water company and also decided to establish a water fee committee to resolve all issues. Unexpectedly, the bureau's Director-General Zhong Si delayed implementation, resulting in the water fee dispute. Repeated suggestions from this association have been shelved, and the water company has intensified its oppression, such as cutting off the water to Bailifu and other areas, dismantling insufficient meters, and even cutting off public water taps that residents themselves installed, endangering the lives of over three thousand residents. This association and representatives from Deli Company went to the Public Works Bureau, but Director-General Zhong Si relied solely on the water company's side of the story, which is truly disheartening. This time, the joint struggle of Deli Company and residents is not just for themselves but for the common interests of our industry and residents within the settlement. According to the contract signed by the Public Works Bureau and the water company, there is absolutely no provision allowing the water company to cut off the water. The water company cannot cut off the water in houses where people live, which shows that the water company's actions are not allowed. The contract between the water company and users or owners stipulates that water can be cut off for non-payment, which conflicts with the basic contract and is naturally invalid. Users or owners consider the water fees agreed upon and have no reason not to pay. However, the water company is becoming increasingly bizarre, cutting off water for failure to pay surcharges, forcing the signing of meter installation contracts, and demanding payment of increased water fees without consent. It completely disregards the basic contract, does not file lawsuits in court according to the law, and endangers all residents, placing them in danger of life and property. Recently, due to the joint struggle of Deli Company and its tenants, our country's lawyers and courts have also paid attention to it. Deli Company and its tenants not only made the water company voluntarily offer discounts twice but also greatly contributed to our country's legal rights and those who enforce the law. This association is grateful to Deli Company and its tenants for their struggle for the public. If there are any actions that infringe on their legitimate rights and public interests, we will do our best to help. All our colleagues should act according to their conscience and rise up together so that Deli Company's goal of fighting for the dignity of tenants and reducing the burden on users can be achieved. I propose: (1) Send a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, which will then forward it to the Shipping Association, stating that all water used by our country's ships should be purchased from our country's water company. (2) Send a letter to the municipal authorities, urging them to quickly have our country's water company handle the water supply for roads outside the settlement. (3) Send another letter to our organization, urging them to quickly drill artesian wells to achieve a lasting solution and reduce residents' living expenses.</p>
<h3>Discussion Items</h3>
<p>(1) The death of Jiang Yansheng, standing committee member and economic director of this association. Resolved: A representative will be sent to attend the memorial service. (2) Appointment of a new standing committee member. Resolved: Li Shuxiong will be appointed. (3) Appointment of a new director. Resolved: Shen Jixuan will be appointed. (4) Confidential. (5) According to a member's report, the water company is revising bills. Resolved: There is one revision, who knows if there will be a second, third, or endless revisions? Members should be notified that when they receive a revised bill, they should only pay after the water fee calculation is confirmed to be accurate and reasonable. (6) Notify members to declare to tenants within three months that starting from a certain month and day, tenants must handle their own water supply. The water fee included in the rent should be deducted by 7.5% of the rent, and the rent receipts should be revised. (7) Send a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, asking them to notify the Shipping Association that all water used by our country's ships should be purchased from our country's water company. Resolved: To be done. (8) Send a letter to the municipal government, urging our country's water company to quickly supply water to the area outside the settlement. Resolved: To be done.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Public Works Bureau</h3>
<p>The Real Estate Association requests the Public Works Bureau to stop the water company's high-pressure tactics of cutting off water. The original letter states: "We are writing to inform you that, according to a letter from our member, Deli Company (letter omitted from yesterday's newspaper), water is indispensable to human life and cannot be denied by anyone. In addition to drinking, it is also necessary for cleanliness. The cleaning slogans posted on trams show that the Public Works Bureau's Health Department also values this. Now, on the one hand, residents are encouraged to use tap water to clean and remove dirt early in the morning, before lunch, and before going to bed. On the other hand, the water company is allowed to cut off water, leaving residents without water to use, struggling to survive without food, drink, and in filth. This is both unreasonable and inhumane and is absolutely contradictory to the authorities' cleaning policies. Furthermore, if the water price is fixed, then the goods are genuine and the price is fair, and there is no room for compromise. Fair treatment can be said to exist. However, the water company previously charged 10% of the rent under the high-pressure tactic of cutting off water, and now it wants to use 15% as a basis, calculating three times the original rate for exceeding this. This proves that its water price is not fixed, and there is no difference between using more and using less. Its ultimate goal is simply to increase its unlimited profits by increasing 6% of the rent to 7.5%, then to 10%, and then to 15% or more. If the water company cuts off water to those who refuse to increase the price, then the large discounts should not be like the high water fee that breaks the principle of 'no increase in fees for meter installation.' The large discounts should be given. Cutting off water immediately, causing unlimited losses to owners and users, should be the responsibility of compensation. According to the information in the letter, we hereby request your bureau to inform the water company for investigation." This is addressed to the Director-General of the Shanghai Public Works Bureau of the International Settlement.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Water Company</h3>
<p>The association contributed its opinion on the meter installation and payment methods, and sent a letter to the water company, stating: "We are responding to your letter of November 17 regarding the method of installing separate water meters, etc. We hereby state that (1) the water fee after meter installation should be collected by the water company from the actual users; (2) each user should install a water meter, and the deposit or meter maintenance fee should be borne by the actual user; and (3) all water fees previously included in the rent should be deducted by the landlord to correct the actual amount of the rent. These are the association's long-standing objective views. Unfortunately, those involved at the time did not adopt the good examples of general water companies due to inaccurate observation and understanding, which caused many disputes and resulted in significant losses for non-actual users. Thinking about it now, it is simply a self-inflicted problem. In terms of law and fact, the water user is one party, the payer is another party, and controlling waste is best achieved by 'planning for oneself rather than planning for others' according to common human nature. In any case, it is like climbing a tree to catch fish. The association's views remain as above. In order to strive for practicality and benefit the public, we make the following technical contributions: (1) Installing water meters in iron boxes for water taps will definitely not cause any problems. There is absolutely no need to modify outdoor water pipes. (2) The water meter deposit can still be reduced and can be the same as that set in Nanshi and Zhabei. It is said that it used to be 18 yuan per unit, but now it is 24 yuan. (3) If the user is unwilling to pay the deposit, it is more convenient to pay a monthly meter maintenance fee of 2 jiao or a corresponding amount. (4) This type of separate meter is absolutely essential. It should immediately replace the impractical large meters and the originally sold adjustable-column separate meters. There should be no difficulty for the Water Division. As for the claim that the water company's capital burden will increase if the water meter deposit is not adopted, which will lead to an increase in water prices, it seems to be the case in theory. However, there are no deposits for equipment such as telephone and electric light meters. However, this is only for the sake of debate. The association only hopes that it will follow the existing methods of general water companies. However, it must be emphasized again that general water companies do not have water meter, deposit, or maintenance fees in addition to water and electricity meter deposits. Furthermore, this association believes that it is best to work together in a peaceful consultation, each holding their own views, to seek solutions to common difficulties. Therefore, it is not appropriate to cut off the water to put people in danger of life. On July 9, 1932, at the Lausanne Conference, British Prime Minister MacDonald said, 'Public prosperity depends on the prosperity of each individual,' which should be regarded as the golden rule. According to the above letter, we hereby reply, hoping that you will investigate and act accordingly." This is addressed to the British Shanghai Waterworks Company.</p>
<h3>Japanese Intelligence Bureau Chief Suma Concurrently Appointed Consul General in Beijing, Promoted for Meritorious Service in Intelligence Work, Will Assume Office in Beijing in the Middle of Next Week</h3>
<p>Suma Yakichiro, director of the Japanese Embassy's Intelligence Bureau and concurrently first secretary, received instructions from the Tokyo Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday to be transferred to the position of Consul General in Beijing, while still holding his original position at the embassy. Yesterday morning, a reporter from Xin Xin News learned from the Japanese side that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs appointed Suma as Consul General in Beijing because of his meritorious service in intelligence work, which will further facilitate intelligence work in the future. It is reported that Suma has been stationed in China for six years, serving in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other places. He has always been known as a China expert. After the January 28th Incident, he became the director of the Intelligence Bureau, probing into our country's military, political, and social conditions. The Japanese side believes that his contribution has been significant. He is currently taking care of some matters and will assume office in Beijing in the middle of next week. He will then travel between Beijing and Shanghai, concurrently serving as Consul General and handling academic affairs in middle schools affiliated with the embassy.</p>
<h3>Land Owners in the Central District Submit Petition to the City Government to Expedite the Issuance of Practice Certificates</h3>
<p>Jiang Hongbin, director of the Miscellaneous Grains and Cake Exchange, submitted a document to Mayor Wu yesterday to expedite the issuance of practice certificates for land in the central district. The document states, "We are submitting a petition for the prompt issuance of practice certificates for land in the central district, for which the land price has already been paid in full, so that we can conduct business. We obtained land in the 30th and 31st districts, totaling over 40 mu, during the first issuance of land in the central district of this city. It was originally scheduled to be paid in four installments, and each installment has been paid in full as scheduled, and receipts from the Land Bureau have been received. The final payment was made at the end of December last year, and it has been almost a year now. Although we have repeatedly applied for the issuance of these practice certificates, they have not yet been issued. Upon inquiry, we were told that it is impossible to issue two certificates for one piece of land because the original land practice certificate was not submitted by the original owner. We believe that the management of land certificates is to determine property rights, and it is true that two levies on one piece of land are not allowed. However, it is difficult to reconcile if we deliberately shelve the matter. Since the property rights of the original owner's land have disappeared due to the land being returned to the central district, the Land Bureau should be fully responsible for the return and cancellation of the original certificate. We paid the land price and obtained the land after fulfilling legal procedures, and the issuance of a certificate to clarify the property rights should not be delayed any further. If the original owner illegally refuses to submit the certificate and the matter is delayed indefinitely, it will not only damage the government's authority, but also make it difficult to demonstrate justice to future generations. Therefore, we hereby submit this petition and implore you to instruct the Land Bureau to issue the practice certificates for the land obtained in the central district as soon as possible, so that we can manage our properties and secure our property rights. We are grateful for your kindness." Sincerely submitted to Wu, Mayor of Shanghai Municipal Government.</p>

<h3>Ma Chongxian Arrested Suddenly for Recruiting Three Ships Back to Shanghai Naval Headquarters Believes He Is Suspected of Being Reactionary Requests City Government to Arrest Him with Assistance of the Police Because There is No Sufficient Evidence, He is Allowed to Post Bail</h3>
<p>Ma Chongxian (also known as Ma Shaopu, Ma Shaoguo), a major staff officer from the Third Fleet of the Central Naval Department and a native of Heilongjiang, recently came to Shanghai on the orders of Commander Xie Gangzhe to negotiate the return of the Haiqi, Haichen, and Zhaohe ships to the fleet. After receiving the order, Ma took the Pu'an ship from Qingdao to Shanghai on the 6th of this month and stayed in room 410 of the Far East Hotel on Xizang Road. On the 7th, he sent a letter to Commander Xie, reporting on the situation after arriving in Shanghai. Unexpectedly, the letter was intercepted by the Naval Department, which believed that the words in the letter were reactionary. It then requested the Shanghai Municipal Government to arrest him. The Municipal Government then ordered the Public Security Bureau to handle the matter. The Public Security Bureau ordered detectives and Chinese detectives led by Wang Shusen from the Old Zhabei Police Station to arrest Ma. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court. Judge Jiang Shuzi and Chief Prosecutor Wang opened the court to interrogate him. The police lawyer Li Zhishan stated that this case was a request from the Public Security Bureau to arrest the defendant. The only evidence the Public Security Bureau has is a letter written by Ma. Examining its content, there is no criminal suspicion found. The court should allow this case to be adjourned so that the Public Security Bureau can forward the evidence to the Naval Department. Then the representative of the Public Security Bureau stated that the Municipal Government had consulted the Naval Department by long-distance telephone yesterday and asked if there was any other evidence. It is unknown whether there was a reply. Today, another official letter has been sent for consultation. Therefore, a postponement is requested. Ma Chongxian replied that he came to Shanghai this time, firstly, to treat his illness and secondly, to handle the affairs of the three ships on the orders of his superiors. If the court does not believe it, it can telegram Shen Honglie, the mayor of Qingdao, and Commander Xie to ask whether I was dispatched on official business. I am an incumbent central official, how can I betray the central government? Please investigate. Fan Gangbi, a lawyer, also argued that the defendant came to Shanghai to recruit three ships back to the fleet, which is clearly for the welfare of the central government. The occurrence of this case may be due to a misunderstanding. Therefore, it is requested that he be allowed to post bail. Judge Jiang then announced that this case would be adjourned for further hearing. Ma Chongxian was allowed to post 1,000 yuan bail and be released pending trial.</p>
<h3>YWCA National Goods Exhibition was a Great Success Yesterday the Exhibition is Extended for One Day</h3>
<p>The exhibits at the YWCA National Goods Exhibition on Yuanmingyuan Road emphasize education and practicality. Therefore, visitors need to study them carefully to understand their value. Otherwise, a cursory glance will not gain anything. It is said that yesterday, in order to increase visitors' interest, those who purchased a 5 jiao entrance ticket were given a game ticket. Prizes included silk stockings, thermos bottles, silk scarves, toys, etc. On the 14th</p>
<h3>Chang Yuqing's Brother Chang Yuting was Blackmailed by Bandits Demanding a Huge Sum of 20,000 Yuan Used Handbill Accusations of Being a Traitor to Intimidate Him it was Found that Chang's Nephew-in-Law and Business Partner Were Responsible</h3>
<p>The Daguan Garden Bathhouse on North Nicheng Bridge, Xizang Road, was founded by Chang Yuqing from Tianjin. During the January 28th Shanghai War last year, Chang served as a traitor, disrupting the rear. After the armistice agreement was signed, Chang could not stand in Shanghai because the official arrest was very strict, so he left Shanghai alone and went to Dalian. The Daguan Garden Bathhouse was operated by his brother Chang Yuting, and his livelihood was not bad. On the 4th of this month, Yuting suddenly received a letter by mail, and upon opening it, there were four miscellaneous handbills attached, accusing Yuting of being a traitor in Zhabei during the Shanghai War and doing various illegal things, intending to extort money. In the center of the handbill, there was a blank oval area, stating that if he did not comply, he would</p>
<h3>Put Chang Yuting's Photo</h3>
<p>On it. After Chang received the letter, he ignored it because this matter was worthless. On the 6th, Chang received another letter stating why he had not come to discuss the matter. He was now warned again and given five days to hand over 20,000 yuan to the intended person. If he violated it again, Yuting would be shot dead. Chang still ignored it. By the 12th, Chang suddenly received a report letter, named Qin, living at No. 121 Shunde Lane, Baier Road, French Concession, and pointed out that the threatening letter Chang received was from Chang's nephew-in-law, Zhang Xingran, a local, and</p>
<h3>Daguan Garden's Business Partner</h3>
<p>Luo Guangqi from Yangzhou. Zhang et al. lived in the Shenzhou Hotel. Chang then learned the secrets of the matter and went to the Xinzhabei Police Station at 8 a.m. yesterday to report and request investigation. The head of the police station immediately ordered the Western detective Lai Yin, Chinese detective Ding Huaguo, etc., accompanied by Yuting, to go to the Shenzhou Hotel on Zhejiang Road. Zhang Xingran was arrested in room 447, and Luo Guangqi was arrested in room 120. After searching, nothing was found. Then they went to Luo's house at No. 17 Fuhai Road, Wenzhou Road, and found a bundle of handbills and a letter from Zhang to his mother-in-law in the box under the bed, with a handbill attached, which was brought to the police station together with the people. After checking, the handbill was exactly the same as the handbill Chang received and ordered to be detained. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police, according to Article 2, Section 2 of the Regulations on Punishing Bandits and Article 370 of the Criminal Law,</p>
<h3>Prosecuted Zhang and Luo for Attempted Extortion by Intimidation</h3>
<p>According to the police lawyer Wang Yaotang, the above situation was explained, saying that after arresting the two defendants, Luo confessed to the inside story in the police station and pointed out Zhang as the instigator. The reason was that Chang used to open the Great World Game Field in Nanjing. Because of poor business, he lost a lot of money. He borrowed 800 yuan from a certain military officer, and then Chang's concubine Wu Suqing repaid it on his behalf before they came to Shanghai together. Later, Chang and Wu suddenly had opinions and requested to leave. Wu then visited lawyer Chen Chou and Yang Guosheng to discuss and negotiate with Chang. As a result, Chang compensated Wu with 800 yuan,</p>
<h3>As a Fee for Leaving</h3>
<p>However, the loan for the price had no whereabouts. Then Wu and actor Zhang Wanrong discussed with Zhang and Luo to write a letter to Chang for blackmail, etc. Yang Guosheng lives at No. 2 Minitini Road. The police and French police detectives went to arrest him, but he was not found. Therefore, this case is requested to be adjourned to verify handwriting and arrest accomplices who are on the run. Then, according to the victim Chang Yuting, this matter was caused by his concubine Wu Suqing, who had already left. The defendants provoked from it and colluded with each other. As for Zhang Wanrong, who is on the run, he used to sing in the Great World in Nanjing, so he knew me and recounted</p>
<h3>The Cause of This Case is Quite Detailed</h3>
<p>Because the words are long and have little to do with this case, it is omitted. When asked, Zhang Xingran confessed that the plaintiff Chang Yuting is my uncle-in-law and treats me very well on weekdays. The relationship is harmonious and he treats me like his own son. This arrest is really Chang's misunderstanding. As for the letter to my mother-in-law found in Luo's house, I did not know anything about it. Checking the handwriting, it was actually written by Chang. Luo Guangqi confessed that he did not know anything about the handbills and other items found. This fact was a malicious accusation by Chang because his concubine Wu Suqing negotiated with Chang and discussed it with me, so he suspected that I was provoking it. It was really an injustice. Lawyer Xuan Zhendong was also hired to defend him. Judge Wu Tingqi verified the confession, and Yu Liang ordered the two defendants to be detained pending a retrial in seven days.</p>
<p>In the evening, the national music of the Xiaozhao Orchestra and the Peking opera singing "Su San Qi Jie" by Ms. Shi Pei were the most outstanding.

<h3>Wang Fuhai Kidnapping Case: Police File Appeal, Affirming Chen Desheng and Others' Involvement, Requesting Court to Overturn Original Verdict</h3>
<p>Wang Zilin from Funing, residing at No. 722 Weihaiwei Road, has been contracted by the Seven Departments to handle fertilizer and stones for many years. He has a successful career, owning assets worth hundreds of thousands. His wife, Yan, has only one daughter, who is married to Xu Yunsun, a native of Anhui working in the customs. For the sake of continuing his lineage, Wang took Zhang as a concubine, who gave birth to a son named Fuhai. He is four years old, clever and lively, and loved like a precious jewel. Unexpectedly, around 6 a.m. on April 27th of last year, while the child was sound asleep in the guest hall upstairs with his grandmother, kidnappers suddenly broke in through the back door. They went upstairs and took Fuhai from the blanket. Wang's mother was greatly alarmed and shouted. Zilin rushed down, disregarding his life, and tried to snatch Fuhai from the bandits. The accomplices of the bandits opened fire, injuring Wang's arm and causing him to fall to the ground. A stray bullet fatally wounded a maid named Li Tao. Fuhai was still abducted and hidden in a remote area of Chongming Island by the leader who hired a boat at the Huishan Wharf, demanding a huge ransom. Wang Zilin, already advanced in age, feared for his only biological son's life and paid a ransom of 40,000 yuan. Subsequently, the Hongkou police arrested two suspects, Wang Xiaosizi and Jiang Shihua, who were sentenced to imprisonment. However, the leader of the kidnapping gang was still at large, and there were no clues to be found. It wasn't until October 15th of this year that Wang Chengying, a Chinese detective of the Jiaru Road police station, and others arrested Chen Desheng, a native of Funing, Jiangbei. He confessed to committing a kidnapping case, namely the kidnapping of Wang Zilin's child Fuhai. He said that the leader was Yan Shirong, a relative of Wang. He confessed to the details of the kidnapping. The detectives apprehended Yan's wife, Chen, who confessed that it was Wang's accountant, Xiang Wenshan, who planned it. Xiang was then arrested and confessed the reason for the case: the instigator was Wang's wife, Yan, due to property disputes. She feared that after Fuhai grew up, the concubine Zhang would seize exclusive power. Therefore, she secretly conspired with her younger brother, Yan Shirong, and her son-in-law, Xu Yunsun, and others. Yan Shirong invited Jiangbei bandits Chen Desheng to carry out the kidnapping, and Wang's workers Yang Yuexiang and Chen Xiaosizi also helped as internal accomplices. The detectives also arrested Wang Yan, Xu Yunsun, Yang Lin, and others, and sent them to the First Special District Court along with Chen Desheng. Chen Desheng, Yan Wang, and Xiang Wenshan confessed without reservation, providing detailed testimonies. The others all denied involvement. During the second court hearing, they suddenly recanted, claiming to be completely unrelated. Although the plaintiff, Wang Zilin, was well aware of the underlying reasons, he did not pursue the matter due to certain relationships. As a result, all defendants were declared not guilty. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, appealed against Chen Desheng, Yan Chen, and Xiang Wenshan, which the court approved. The others were released. Yesterday afternoon, Zhao Zheng, a judge from the Criminal Division of the Second High Court, along with Judges Jiang and Zhou, came to the criminal court to conduct a preliminary hearing. The police lawyer, Zhang, stated that the defendants had confessed in detail at the police station and during the original trial, vividly describing how they planned and carried out the kidnapping, which was consistent with the police's statements and without any contradictions. Furthermore, their attitude was firm, and Xiang Wenshan told the two workers, Yang and Chen, that they should not deny it, which was very intense. Therefore, he requested that the original judgment be overturned and that they be punished according to the law. When questioned, Chen Desheng, Yan Chen, and Xiang Wenshan denied their previous confessions, claiming that they were not made voluntarily and asking for understanding. The plaintiff, Wang Zilin, stated that the defendants were not present when Fuhai was kidnapped. Judge Zhao instructed that they be detained separately and that a date be set for the verdict.</p>
<h3>A Lustful Man Encounters a "Honey Trap": A Rogue Cleverly Uses a Beauty Trap, Simple Country Folk Suffer Losses</h3>
<p>Zhao Meisheng from Suzhou, nearly forty years old, is inherently lustful. His financial ability is not weak, and he is not stingy when it comes to buying pleasure. Therefore, he frequents brothels in Hanzhuang. However, his behavior is somewhat crude, making him easily manipulated. A man named Zhang, who knows Zhao well, set up a "honey trap" on the 14th of this month. After arranging everything carefully, he went to Zhao's residence upstairs at the Yonghe Pharmacy on Guizhou Road and invited Zhao out, saying that there was a beautiful girl named Liu Xiuying, who was young and beautiful. Although she came from a good family, she could be easily seduced. If Zhao was interested, he would not hesitate to introduce them. Zhao, who was easily swayed by hearsay and whose desires were piqued, did not consider the consequences and, after gathering his money, followed Zhang to find this paradise. On the way, they suddenly saw a young woman standing gracefully, seemingly waiting for someone. Zhang pointed to the woman and said to Zhao, "This is her." In reality, although the woman was young, her appearance was only average. However, Zhao, after being subjected to a few glances from the woman, was already captivated and considered her a celestial being. At that time, Zhang continued to act as a guide, and they went to the Qinghe Hotel on Zhejiang Road, opening a secret room to enjoy their intimate feelings. With Zhang's mission completed, he left. Zhao and the woman closed the door and were about to undress and get into bed when suddenly five strong men broke into the room. They were fierce. The leader, Liu Zhengyuan from Wuxi, claimed to be Xiuying's husband and accused Zhao of seducing a married woman. The other four, Liu Zhengting, Chen Huating, Zhang Yanlan, and Zhu Binshan, echoed his words and either slapped Zhao or kicked him. Zhao, outnumbered, could only plead. After beating him, Liu and the others took Zhao's long gown and the 22 yuan in his pocket. Because they still thought the amount was too small, they decided to force Zhao to negotiate somewhere else. As soon as they left the hotel, they were spotted by Cui Jinchuan, a detective from the Laozha police station. After inquiring about the situation, he brought them all back to the police station. After questioning by the head detective, Zhao and Liu Xiuying were released, and Liu Zhengyuan and the other four were detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District Court. Judge Qian Hongye conducted a preliminary hearing. The police lawyer, Zhang Shizhu, explained the circumstances of the case, stating that the defendants dared to use the "honey trap" to extort money, which was unforgivable. He requested that they be punished for the crime of intimidation and fraud. Then, Zhao Meisheng testified, saying that Zhang introduced him to Liu Xiuying and that he did not try to seduce her. However, Liu Xiuying sided with her husband, saying that Zhao and Zhang had been stalking her for days, leading her to be lured to the hotel. The defendant, Liu Zhengyuan, also testified that Xiuying was his wife and that yesterday, because she was lured to the hotel by Zhao and others, he and his friends went to catch them in the act. The others gave evasive answers. The court reviewed the testimonies and found that the defendants were clearly trying to cover up the truth. Immediately, the court declared the verdict: the defendants were found guilty of attempted extortion and each was fined 50 yuan. If they were unable to pay, they would be imprisoned for one day for every two yuan. The defendants each posted 50 yuan bail. Those who could not post bail were remanded in custody pending execution of the sentence.</p>
<h3>Gelling Agent Extracted from Yellow Okra Juice, a Raw Material for Liu Paper, Solidifies Itself 丨Invention by Dr. Xie Hui丨</h3>
<p>The juice of yellow okra, produced in China, is a raw material for making machine-made "Lian Shi" and "Mao Bian" paper. It makes the paper smooth and prevents ink from bleeding when writing, making it widely used. The industrialist Tianxu Wosheng once encouraged farmers to plant it to increase by-products. However, okra juice has a disadvantage: it is not easy to store, and the market is sluggish, making it waste. Farmers suffer losses. Dr. Xie Hui, a chemistry professor at Jiaotong University, recognizing this problem, has been engaged in research. Now, he has been able to extract the gelling agent from the okra juice, making it solidify and can be stored for a long time. The experiment has been successful, and the industrial community has praised it highly. This is good news for improving China's agricultural products.</p>

<h3>Stamping Foreign Liquor: Chinese and Foreign Merchants Should Be Treated Equally, the Machine Industry Association Appeals to the Ministry of Finance for Review and Implementation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Machine-Made National Products Factory Association believes that the stamp tax on foreign liquor and alcohol is not applied consistently to Chinese and foreign merchants, causing hardship for domestic manufacturers. Yesterday, it appealed to the Ministry of Finance for equal treatment. The original appeal stated, "Regarding the tax on Chinese-made imitation foreign liquor and alcohol, please treat Chinese and foreign merchants equally." According to Article 1 of the Provisional Regulations on Foreign Liquor Tax issued by the Ministry of Finance in June of the 18th year of the Republic of China, "All foreign liquor sold within the country must pay taxes according to the provisions of these Regulations." Section 2 states, "The aforementioned foreign liquor, whether manufactured by foreigners or imitated by Chinese, or imported, is subject to these regulations." Currently, the Shanghai Baoshan Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Collection Sub-Bureau requires Chinese-made imitation foreign liquor to be stamped on each bottle. For imported goods, after tariff autonomy, the import tax rate on foreign liquor has been increased. Therefore, according to the principle of not taxing the same item twice, stamping is no longer required. However, most of the brandy foreign liquor consumed in the market</p>
<h3>Foreigners Mostly Exploit Loopholes</h3>
<p>The raw materials are imported in barrels, bottled and sold in China. According to the current import tax rate, barrelled foreign liquor is taxed at 50% of its value. Although it is unknown how the value is assessed, the tax rate for bottled liquor under the same item 378 is only one yuan and three jiao of customs gold per case of twelve quarts, which is about two jiao of national currency per bottle. However, according to the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Machine-Made Liquor Stamp Tax Rate Table set by the Jiangsu Stamp Tax Office, bottled brandy liquor is stamped at six jiao and five fen per bottle. Therefore, even if the tariff has been increased, it is still less than one-third of the original stamp tax rate. Imported goods from foreign merchants are exempt from stamping, while Chinese-made imitation foreign liquor is still subject to stamping. This is tantamount to protecting and promoting the sales of foreign liquor. Because foreign liquor is declared for import in barrels, paying 50% of the value, it is bottled with water, containing only half alcohol, which is equivalent to paying only 25% of the tax. Chinese merchants who purchase barrelled foreign liquor and bottle it with water for sale must not only pay 50% of the value for the import tax on raw materials but also pay a stamp tax of 30% of the value. If it contains half water, it is equivalent to paying 110% of the value. This is the first inequality between Chinese and foreign merchants in the collection of taxes on bottled liquor. Furthermore, according to Article 3 of the Provisional Regulations on Foreign Liquor Tax, the tax on spirits is 20 yuan per hundred jin. This was set in June of the 18th year of the Republic of China, which is the same as the 341st item in the Jiangsu Stamp Tax Office Special Stamp Tax Table, which stipulates that spirits and alcohol are taxed at 20 yuan per hundred jin and 1.5 yuan per English gallon. At that time, the import tariff was only 5% of the value, and the tax per gallon was only four fen of national currency. After tariff autonomy, it gradually increased. As of the amendment on May 22nd of this year, pure spirits are taxed at four jiao five fen six li of customs gold per gallon including surtax, which is about nine jiao one fen of national currency. Compared with the previous tariff, it has increased more than 22 times. Although the tax on poisonous denatured spirits has been reduced by about half, it is still about four jiao six fen of national currency, which is more than ten times higher than before. Foreign merchants' alcohol is used in factories located in the concessions. In addition to paying import taxes, there is no possibility of stamp duty. Chinese merchants' alcohol is used in factories located in Chinese territory. They must pay the same import tax, and they must also pay stamp duty. For example, the pharmaceutical industry uses it as an immersion agent, the hardware industry uses it to make varnish, and the cosmetics industry uses it in cologne. If the products are made by foreign merchants in factories located in the concessions, the alcohol used costs only nine jiao one fen per gallon. If the products are made by Chinese merchants in factories located in Chinese territory, then in addition to paying a tariff of nine jiao one fen per gallon, they must also pay a stamp tax of one yuan and five jiao. Regardless of its value, the tax burden is already disparate. For the same product, foreign merchants can sell it for nine jiao one fen, while Chinese merchants must sell it for two yuan four jiao one fen. Isn't this</p>
<h3>Clearly Blocking the Road for Chinese Merchants</h3>
<p>Turning it into a guarantee for foreign merchants, it is straight for a fish in an abyss, which will make Chinese circles, no rest of Bai factory place, the affairs of the world are not more unequal than this, the members and factories are the same without a way, I want a final solution is to come to the meeting to discuss, please immediately prepare a document from the club to submit to your department to solve it, the method is as follows, (1) the first clause of the Provisional Regulations on Foreign Liquor Tax, the second item of the original text, regardless of foreign manufacturers, Chinese imitations, and imports, it now belongs to the imported foreign liquor sold on the market, because the tariff has been increased, according to the principle of one thing not taxing twice, it can no longer be stamped, then all Chinese-imitated foreign liquor, purchased barrel bags of raw materials, and bottled, should be allowed to present the tax payment certificate that has been paid, with the same treatment, and no longer stamped, if there is no certificate that has been paid the same tax, it is manufactured and sold in China, then Chinese and foreign merchants should be stamped, so that the powers and responsibilities of the collection bureau are clear, and it will not exclude national goods for foreigners, (2) the tax rate in the third clause of the same chapter, the customs duty has been increased, and imports are slightly Customs duty, except for exemption from stamping, is originally aimed at those who manufacture and sell in China, because it has not been completed Customs duty, there is no certificate document collection, it should be taxed according to regulations, in order to prevent stealing and taking advantage of it, because according to the current import tax rules 381 and 384, it should be levied at 50% of the value, now according to the third clause of the foreign liquor tax, it only needs to be extracted 30% of the value, it is not a lot of convenience because its factory is located in China, employing national workers, and recovering external profit rights, as for the alcohol item, the new tariff has been increased to customs gold four corners and five points for each English unit, which is about</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>Nine-pointed one-pointed state currency, if manufactured and sold in the country, according to Article 3 of the Foreign Liquor Tax Law, 20 yuan per hundred jin is slightly collected, which is equal to one yuan and five corners per unit, a difference of more than half, which will make it impossible to manufacture and sell in the country, not purchase imports, and it is intended to be promoted and sold for imports only, so it is proposed to check the above-mentioned situation and reduce it to 20 yuan of tax per 100 kilograms, or 9.1 corners of tax per English unit, so that it is possible to realize manufacturing in the country, if it is purchased from imports Alcohol, has completed the customs duty, should be allowed to present the certificate,</p>
<h3>Chinese and Foreign One Stroke Treatment</h3>
<p>No longer stamped, whether the above two points are appropriate, please approve to follow, so as to hold the approval to the bureau to contact, and safety operations, if you are afraid of alcohol as shochu, the State Council Decree No. 13, has been banned in the case, dry criminal chapter, and the native burning price is now only 7 yuan per hundred jin, about 6.3 corners per unit, while the alcohol tariff must be collected 9.1 corners, plus the price of wine, not only unprofitable, but also to post the book, which is fundamentally impossible fact, and in the original intention of taxation, it has been completely penetrated the original intention, and without prejudice, I hope that the Ministry will check and implement it, it is really convenient,</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Approved: Flour Exported with Half Tax, Bran Exported as Usual</h3>
<p>According to Heping News Agency, the Shanghai Flour Industry Association believes that more and more foreign flour is imported recently, and the sales of domestic flour have stagnated and the business has declined sharply. Special requests have been made to the Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi to cancel the export ban on wheat flour and approve tax-free exports in order to provide relief. After considering the situation, the Ministry of Finance has reviewed and approved the lifting of the ban on the export of wheat flour. It can be handled as is. As for wheat bran, which has never been banned from transportation, it is difficult to avoid taxes. The petition has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for notification. The flour industry's submission and the Ministry of Finance's approval are recorded as follows.</p>
<h3>Flour Industry's Submission</h3>
<p>Submit to the Department of Commerce for the export ban on rice and wheat, which has been canceled, and the flour is the same. I respectfully request the Department of Commerce to continue to lift the ban and export tax-free. The case of flour submitted for approval to continue to ban the export will expire on December 1 of this year. Now, in the flour market in our country, the production and sales have been greatly affected since the fall of the Northeast, coupled with the dumping of foreign flour and the bankruptcy of rural areas, the sales are increasingly sluggish. I am planning to submit a request to permanently lift the ban on export in order to find a way out. Recently, I read in the newspaper that the Executive Yuan's Yuanwu meeting has passed and canceled the export ban on rice and wheat. It has been issued to the provincial governments for implementation. I also read in your Department's order to the Jianghai Customs Superintendent, "In addition to instructing the Director-General of Customs to transfer orders to the customs directors of various countries, rice grains, wheat, sorghum, millet, buckwheat, corn, and other miscellaneous grains that were originally prohibited from transportation to foreign countries shall be prohibited from transportation and exempted from export tax. They are to be instructed to comply." Now the price of flour is falling, affecting the price of wheat. Commerce and rural areas are closely related. Now rice, wheat, and other miscellaneous grains have been uniformly lifted. For example, sesame seeds, which have always been subject to an export tax of five cents of silver per five hundred catties, are now approved for tax-free export. Flour is the same. Without the approval of tax-free export of Chinese flour, it is not enough to reject the influx of foreign flour. In addition, bran is wheat bran, an appendage of flour, and should be treated the same as No. 2, 3, and 4 flour. I respectfully request that your Department order the Jianghai Customs Superintendent and the Director-General of Customs to transfer orders to the customs directors of various customs to permanently lift the ban on export and exempt taxes in order to facilitate circulation and maintain the flour industry.</p>
<h3>Approval of the Ministry of Finance</h3>
<p>The Flour Industry Association received Order No. 179 from the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating that the case of the export ban on flour was originally handled by the Ministry of Finance upon order because of the food shortage caused by disasters in the country at that time. Now, the situation of oversupply and sluggish sales of agricultural products in various places is actually the opposite of what it was before. The request to lift the ban on the export of No. 2, 3, and 4 wheat flour can be approved. However, wheat flour has not been subject to customs duties. The current tax is still a special tax, which is obviously different from the customs duties on other grains. Therefore, it cannot be completely tax-free. It should still be taxed upon leaving the factory according to the regulations of the wheat flour special tax regulations. After the export, half of the actual tax amount will be refunded in order to comply with the regulations and encourage export. As for bran, most of it is for industrial use, with a large amount exported annually. It has never been banned from transportation and is inherently different from grains. It is difficult to be exempted from taxes in the same way. Moreover, this association submitted a request for tax exemption on wheat bran exports in July of this year, which was approved by this Ministry. It should be handled according to the case. In addition to forwarding the presentation and issuing orders separately, the approval is known. This approval.</p>
<h3>First Batch: American Wheat Arrives Tomorrow Night, Unloading at Floating Buoy No. 16, Requesting Exemption from New Import Tax</h3>
<p>The first batch of American wheat borrowed from the loan, shipped from Portland to Shanghai, was originally scheduled to arrive on Tuesday. Later, due to fog, the arrival date in Shanghai was delayed. Now, it has been confirmed that it will arrive tomorrow. However, since the arrival of the goods in Shanghai coincides with the announcement of increased tariffs on foreign rice and wheat, problems are bound to arise. The situation is urgently recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Unloading at Floating Buoy</h3>
<p>The wheat in the ship totals 8,940 tons. Yesterday, the ship owner telegraphed that it had passed Japan and would arrive at the Wusongkou at 5 pm tomorrow. The pilots have been prepared here to take it into the Huangpu River tonight. However, because all the wheat on the ship has been sold, it will not dock at the Chinese warehouses, but will be anchored at Floating Buoys No. 16 and 17. The buyers will hire barges to unload the cargo alongside the ship. It is estimated that the hatch can be opened to unload the goods on Monday.</p>
<h3>Tariff Issue</h3>
<p>This batch of American wheat was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 12th. Even if tariffs were levied, it could be imported before the new tax was implemented, and there would be no problem. Now, due to the fog, the ship is delayed. However, if it could follow the Pacific route, it could still arrive before the implementation of the tax. The delay is due to the ship owner taking a long detour around the ocean, causing the arrival date to be after the promulgation of the new tax. The error is not in the fog. After the ship arrives in Shanghai, the American Wheat Administration must negotiate with the ship owner about this matter.</p>
<h3>Requesting Tax Exemption</h3>
<p>If this batch of American wheat is paid according to the new tax, at least more than 40,000 yuan will be paid. Moreover, batches two, three, four, and five have been loaded and are about to arrive successively. If taxes are required, the tax rate for these five ships alone will be 200,000 yuan. Moreover, there are more large amounts of goods coming. The reporter learned yesterday that the American Wheat Administration has submitted this matter to the central government, stating that a large part of the American wheat shipped to Shanghai on loan will be used for disaster relief (the Yellow River disaster will also use American wheat as a substitute for relief). The central government should be requested to exempt the import tax. The submission has been made and may be approved for tax exemption.</p>
<h3>Father of Kim Seok: Urges the Authorities Again to Negotiate and Submits a Letter to the French Central Police Station Requesting Release</h3>
<p>Since Kim Seok, a naturalized Korean, was arrested, various sectors have spoken out in support, but he has not yet been released. His father, Kim Young-tak (i.e., Kim Cheol), yesterday submitted separate letters to the Municipal Government and the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting speedy negotiations. The original submissions are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<h3>Submitting to the Municipal Government</h3>
<p>Regarding a submission: I, the submitter Zi Jinzhe, was illegally arrested in the French Concession by the French Central Police Station, with the assistance of the Japanese Consulate General. I, the submitter, petitioned your office to protest to the Japanese Consul General, but the Japanese Consulate General has been unreasonable and has not released me. In addition to requesting another protest to the Japanese Consul General, I request a serious protest to the French Consul General. Zi Jinzhe, along with the submitter, was naturalized as a Chinese citizen in the eighteenth year of the Republic (copy attached), and has resided at 446 Avenue Petain in the French Concession for several years. The French Concession is Chinese territory, and Zi Jinzhe is a citizen of the Republic of China. Even if there is suspicion of a crime, it should be under the jurisdiction of the Chinese court. No country other than China can arrest, deliver to a non-Chinese court, detain, or judge him. Now, the French Central Police Station, acting on the instructions of the Japanese Consulate General, has assisted in the illegal arrest of a Chinese citizen residing within its concession and, after detaining him at the police station, handed him over to the Japanese Consulate General's staff for detention. This is an infringement of our national sovereignty. Although the submitter's representatives, Li Shichang and lawyer Xu Jie, brought the submitter's and Zi Jinzhe's nationality permits to inquire, the French Central Police Station claimed that it did not know that Zi Jinzhe had been naturalized as a Chinese citizen and made the excuse that Zi Jinzhe claimed to be of Korean nationality. The reason why the submitter and his son naturalized as Chinese citizens was to enjoy the rights granted to Chinese citizens by the Chinese state and to fulfill the obligations of Chinese citizens to the Chinese state. Zi Jinzhe is not naive or ignorant, so how could he voluntarily abandon the rights granted to him by the Chinese state and willingly claim to be of Korean nationality? When the submitter's representative, lawyer Xu Jie, asked the police station if there was a record of his confession that he claimed to be of Korean nationality, they said no. Therefore, the French Central Police Station's claim that Zi Jinzhe claimed to be of Korean nationality is entirely a fabrication. Furthermore, the submitter and his son Zhezhe were illegally arrested by the Japanese Consulate General in the French Concession in November of last year. After your office and various French organizations protested strongly and presented the submitter's and Zhezhe's naturalization permits, they were sent back to the French Police Station for release. The matter involved several countries, and the French Police Station was the most important party involved. Therefore, the French Police Station already knew that Zi Jinzhe was a Chinese citizen. The reason why they claimed not to know was to shirk the responsibility of delivering him. This is very obvious. Even if they did not know that Zi Jinzhe had been naturalized as a Chinese citizen at the time and mistakenly delivered him, now that the submitter's representative has presented the naturalization certificate to prove it, the French Police Station is obliged to demand that the Japanese Consulate General return Zi Jinzhe. After repeated negotiations, the French Central Police Station turned a deaf ear. Their contempt for our national authority has reached its extreme. Moreover, Zi Jinzhe is not the only naturalized Chinese citizen residing in the French Concession. If this precedent is set, who will not be in danger? The naturalization clause of the Nationality Law is equivalent to a dead letter, and the naturalized citizens will lose all respect for the country. Moreover, it is recently learned that Zi Jinzhe is about to be sent to Japan. In order to request your office to protest to the Japanese Consulate General again, please issue a swift protest to the French Consul General. I would be most grateful. I respectfully submit this to Wu, Mayor of the Shanghai Municipal Government.</p>
<h3>Submitting to the Foreign Affairs Office</h3>
<p>Regarding a submission: My eldest son, Zi Jinzhe, formerly of Korean nationality, acquired Chinese nationality on October 5th of the eighteenth year of the Republic, along with the submitter, and holds Nationality Permit No. 67 of the Ministry of the Interior (film attached). He established residence in the French Concession of Shanghai. On November 22nd of this year, he was illegally arrested at 451 Route Pere Robert in the French Concession by the French Central Police Station with the assistance of the Japanese Consulate General. After arriving at the French Central Police Station, he was immediately handed over to the Japanese Consulate General. The submitter's representatives, lawyers Li Shichang and Xu Jie, presented the submitter's and Zi Jinzhe's nationality permits and negotiated with the French Central Police Station. The French Central Police Station claimed that they did not know that Zi Jinzhe had been naturalized as a Chinese citizen at the time. Furthermore, lawyers Xu Jie and Lou Yunmei, on behalf of the submitter, requested the French Consul General to notify the Japanese Consul General to release Zi Jinzhe, and submitted it to the Shanghai Municipal Government to protest to the Japanese Consulate General. Zi Jinzhe is a Chinese citizen and the French Concession is Chinese territory. The illegal arrest by the Japanese Consulate General is an infringement of national sovereignty. The French Central Police Station's assistance in the arrest and delivery not only violates the agreement regarding the establishment of a Chinese court in the French Concession of Shanghai, but also shows contempt for our entire country. Although there have been negotiations and protests, the Japanese Consul General has delayed his release. It is recently learned that Zi Jinzhe is about to be sent to Japan. The matter concerns individual legal interests, which are small, but concerns national authority, which is great. Therefore, I especially submit this to your office. In addition to protesting to the Japanese and French Consulates General separately, please forward this to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for serious negotiations so that Zi Jinzhe can be released as soon as possible and Chinese sovereignty can be protected. I would be most grateful. I respectfully submit this to Yu, Director of the Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>International Organizations Host Mrs. Bushm</h3>
<p>Mrs. Bushm, founder and director of the America Friends of China Society in Chicago, USA, came to Shanghai for a visit. The International Problems Research Association, in order to connect and foster friendship, specially united with the China Committee of the China-America Cooperative Association and the Shanghai Women's Association, held a tea party at Zheng's residence on Route Delestre (14th) at 5 pm the day before yesterday to express welcome. In addition to more than 60 members and their wives from each association, Mr. and Mrs. Arnold, the U.S. Commercial Counselor, and Dr. Mei Lanfang were also present. Everyone gathered together, which was quite lively. The party ended at 7 o'clock.</p>
<h3>China International Famine Relief Commission - Yellow River Disaster Agricultural Relief Investigators Depart</h3>
<p>The Shanghai office of the China International Famine Relief Commission, located on the second floor of 49 Nanjing Road, recently received a notice from the Beijing headquarters stating that the donations received by the association for the Yellow River disaster have reached more than 50,000 yuan. It is planned to implement agricultural relief in the affected areas as soon as possible. Li Zhemian and Huang Xiangsheng were specially appointed as investigators to go to the severely affected areas such as Heze, Kaocheng, Dongming, and Changyuan to investigate the various methods of disaster relief in the affected areas in order to start work. Mr. Li and others have already set off south from Beijing on the 7th of this month.</p>
<h3>Method of Notifying for Partial Pickup of Goods Storage Fees in Batches on Two Railways</h3>
<p>A circular from the Traffic Department of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways stated: After full carloads of goods arrive, if they are picked up in batches (for example, if 10 tons have been picked up from a 25-ton load, leaving 15 tons), the remaining goods exceed the prescribed free storage period.</p>
<h3>Post Office Issues Commemorative Stamps with Portrait of Chen Qimei - Two Denominations: One Cent and Fifty Cents</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Post Office has recently issued two new commemorative stamps with the portrait of a martyr, in the denominations of one cent and fifty cents. Both feature the portrait of Chen Qimei. According to the post office, the following types have also been issued successively before: two types of stamps with the portrait of Deng Keng, half cent and two and a half cents; two types of stamps with the portrait of Liao Zhongkai, three cents and thirty cents; two types of stamps with the portrait of Zhu Zhixin, eight cents and thirteen cents; two types of stamps with the portrait of Song Jiaoren, ten cents and seventeen cents; and two types of stamps with the portrait of Huang Xing, twenty cents and forty cents. Adding the two newly issued stamps, the whole set has portraits of six martyrs.</p>
<p>After the time has passed, should the storage fee be calculated according to the whole car or another price rate? As there are no explicit regulations, it is difficult to follow. This has been discussed and resolved at the Fourth Traffic Conference. The storage fee should be calculated separately on the cargo ticket and loose cargo should be charged according to the proportion of the freight. This will be recorded. The price rate for this storage fee should be based on the freight paid at the time of loading. Although the actual storage of goods picked up in batches from a full carload is less than a full car, the freight paid at the time of loading is calculated based on the full car. The storage fee should be collected according to the weight of the remaining part (less than one ton is counted as one ton) and calculated as the storage fee for the full car. As for loose cargo, it should be charged according to the proportion of the freight weight. This circular is issued urgently and should be followed.</p>
<h3>Rose Garden New Village Seeking Residents</h3>
<p>The China New Village Construction Company, located at 20 Rue du Musée in this city, has opened up 100 acres of land next to the Shanghai-Minhang Road, 10 kilometers from the concession, to build the Rose Garden New Village, consisting of 50 imagined modern houses. Details have been recorded in this newspaper. It is understood that the company has not yet publicly solicited residents as the plan has just been finalized. However, news has spread among people in society who love new village life, and more than half have gone to make reservations. This is enough to show that the company's efforts meet the general needs of the community. In order to implement the proposition of "solving the housing problem for society", the company will publicly solicit residents for the remaining units from today onwards, in order to show equal opportunities.</p>
<h3>Grand Opening Ceremony of the Paramount - Over 1,000 Guests from All Walks of Life Attended - Guests Danced Merrily and Dispersed - The Official Opening Ceremony Was Last Night</h3>
<p>The construction of the Paramount Ballroom has taken more than a year, and it was successfully completed today. Its solemn and magnificent appearance and its brilliant interior have already caused a sensation throughout Shanghai, with people spreading the news. Yesterday was the official opening of the ballroom, and the evening of the 14th was the day of the opening ceremony of the hotel. The board of directors of the hotel specially invited celebrities from all walks of life, both Chinese and foreign, to come and visit. Among those who attended were Mayor Wu Tiecheng and his wife, Municipal Secretary Yu Hongjun and his wife, and their subordinates; foreign guests included Mr. and Mrs. Ke Yinhai, the US Consul General, Mr. and Mrs. Olsson, the Norwegian Consul, and Mr. and Mrs. Arnold, the former Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council; figures from the business community such as Du Yuesheng, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Yuan Lidung, and Dai Gengxin; figures from the newspaper industry such as Zhang Zhuping, Xiong Shaohao, Wang Boqi, and Ma Yinliang; as well as male and female movie stars and newspaper reporters, totaling more than 1,000 people. The event was grand and unprecedented. The chairman of the company, Gu Chongqing, the general manager, Zhu Hongru, and directors Zhuang Zhujiu, Zhou Zhisheng, Qian Nanshan, Hong Zuoyao, Zhou Bingchen, and Zheng Xitao, entertained the guests warmly. At a quarter past five, Mrs. Mayor Wu and Ms. Zhang Qianying respectively opened the door and unveiled the plaque, and then everyone took their seats. The chairman of the hotel, Mr. Gu Chongqing, took the stage to deliver a welcoming speech while the Paramount Orchestra played a welcome song, and thanked the guests for their trouble. Then Secretary-General Yu gave a speech on behalf of Mayor Wu. The Paramount Orchestra played a symphony, and the guests rose to dance on the sprung floor downstairs and the glass floor of the upstairs hall. At half-past seven, there was a temporary break. After the tableware was arranged, the guests returned to their seats, the music played again, and the dancers rose to their feet. Whether stepping on the sprung floor or climbing on the glass floor, everyone danced to their heart's content, praising it as the only banquet and dance venue in Shanghai. On the spot, male and female singing and dancing stars selected from the United States and hired to Shanghai performed various novel dances. The programs were wonderful and unprecedented in Shanghai. The female dancers "Ann," "Eve," and "Fula," and the black male dancer "Pilai Hei," were particularly outstanding. Each performance was breathtaking. It was not until after midnight that the guests dispersed joyfully. It is also heard that all banquet and dance halls in the hotel, which can accommodate more than a thousand people, have been fully booked, as yesterday was the official opening for business.</p>

<h3>Founders of Changzhou National Goods Market Come to Shanghai to Visit</h3>
<p>Mr. He Xiaohu and other gentry and merchants from Changzhou, enthusiastic about promoting national goods, raised funds to establish the Changzhou China National Goods Market. They sent a letter to the Shanghai Citizens' National Goods Promotion Association requesting assistance in the process, soliciting various factories to participate, and scheduled the opening on New Year's Day of the national calendar next year. It is understood that the founders of the market, Mr. He Xiaohu and Mr. He Yunzhong, arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Changzhou, visited various standing committee members of the association, and discussed all cooperation matters. The result was very satisfactory. That evening, Mr. Chen Binghui hosted a banquet at Yuebinlou to welcome the two gentlemen and to express the friendship of the host. Xu Jianruo, Qian Lijun, Zhang Lixing, Xu Zhongyuan, Xu Qiaoqi, and other gentlemen were also invited to accompany them. During the banquet, they discussed in detail the market equipment, progress plan, and factory business strategy. The guests and hosts parted on good terms.

<h3>Cotton Industry Association's Dissatisfaction with the Evaluation of Cotton Standards</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Cotton Industry Association stated that among the cotton delivered to the Yarn and Cloth Exchange in October, more than 20,000 dan were substandard. Customers requested a re-inspection, but the exchange delayed the evaluation meeting until November 9th. First, more than 1,700 dan of Taicang cotton were inspected, and most of them did not meet the original standards. The exchange knew it was wrong, but delayed evaluating the remaining 20,000 dan, causing great losses to customers. Now, customers will file a lawsuit based on illegal and untrustworthy reasons, seeking a fair judgment.</p>
<h3>Yang Bingxun's Handling of the Reproduction of Shorthand Studies - Victims Can Enroll for Free</h3>
<p>Regarding the dispute of counterfeiting and reprinting Bingxun's shorthand studies, which was published in the newspapers a few days ago, the inventor Yang Bingxun has found out that it was indeed done by the Nanjing YMCA. The association hired Zhang Mianzhi to privately set up a Chinese shorthand course, reprinted Bingxun's shorthand textbook, irrationally attempted to modify Bingxun's shorthand symbols, making it difficult for students to learn, and used the name of guaranteeing job introductions to seduce young people. In order to maintain the reputation of Bingxun's shorthand and protect the studies of young people, victims can use the tuition receipts issued by the YMCA and the reprinted textbooks or mimeographed handouts to register at the Bingxun Shorthand School in Gaoshou Lane, Haining Road, Shanghai, by registered mail. Mr. Yang will be responsible for teaching, whether in person or by correspondence, and will not charge additional tuition. It is heard that similar counterfeit incidents have also occurred in Hangzhou and other places. Victims will also receive the same treatment.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Hospital's New President System</h3>
<p>The board of directors of the Shanghai Hospital in Nanshi, which has long had a dual-leader system of Director of Medical Affairs and Director of Administrative Affairs, decided to amend the hospital's articles of association this winter due to the hospital's poor performance, and switch to a president system. They also drafted a reorganization plan, intending to seek out competent talent to serve as president. Yesterday, the hospital's board of directors held a meeting, with directors Huang Hanzhi, Hong Kui, Gu Xinyi, Qin Yanqi, Shen Gao, Zhang Binghui, Yao Xinzhi, Huang Yunchen, and other eight people present. After discussion, they were not very satisfied with the current Director of Medical Affairs, Zhou Chuliang. However, as there were no suitable candidates for the time being, it was decided that Director of Medical Affairs Zhou would temporarily act as the president for a term of three months, receiving his original salary. Director Shen Gao was also asked to supervise and improve the hospital according to the reorganization plan, and report to the board of directors for review after the term expired. The meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Organization Minister of the Communist Seamen's Union, Li Aide, Arrested</h3>
<p>Guangdong native, Zeng Bao, also known as Li Aide, is the current organization minister of the Communist Seamen's Union (referred to as the Seamen's Union). He formerly served as the secretary and standing committee member of the union. He was arrested the day before yesterday by the Public Security Bureau and the police in Tangshan Road, Jingzhou Road, and sent to the No. 2 Branch of the High Court. The police lawyer Li Zhishan said that the defendant confessed to arriving in Shanghai on the 12th on the Taikoo liner "Guangdong" from Guangdong. After investigation by the police, the liner could not arrive in Shanghai until the 14th, which shows that his statements were false. Because the police still needed to investigate, a request was made to postpone the hearing. Subsequently, the Public Security Bureau obtained a certificate from the offender Yuan Ziqing, proving that he was a colleague when he served on the Standing Committee of the Seamen's Union. Judge Zhou questioned Zeng once and ordered him to be remanded in custody and re-examined at a later date. A certain evening newspaper reported that Zeng was a lieutenant of the Communist Navy. This is actually a mistake for the Standing Committee of the Seamen's Union, because the Communist Party has never been heard to have a naval organization.</p>
<h3>Feng Wenfeng's Calligraphy is Famous in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The female calligrapher Feng Wenfeng is the daughter of Feng Shihhan, a epigraphist from Heshan. Shihhan had a rich collection of steles and wrote official script for more than thirty years.

More than 100 graduates have made a name for themselves in the art world. Many people in South China who love calligraphy and painting have Miss Feng's works. Recently, Ye Gongchuo, Wang Yiting, Huang Binlang, Pan Lanshi, Wu Tiecheng, Lu Danlin, and others have helped her to set calligraphy rates. Those who seek her calligraphy are very enthusiastic. The Wenyi Company on Sijing Road collects the requests. Letters requesting price examples can be mailed to Deng's residence at 1760 Haining Road.</p>
<h3>Qin Shengjie's Painting Exhibition Opens at the Ningbo Fellow Association</h3>
<p>The landscape painting exhibition by the famous Liangxi painter Qin Shengjie and the exhibition of ancient calligraphy and paintings in his family collection opened yesterday on the fourth floor of the Ningbo Fellow Association on Xizang Road. The exhibition will last for four days and will end next Monday. Although it was raining yesterday, no less than four or five hundred people visited from morning to dusk. In the previous Qing dynasty, the two Qins were the most famous painters in Wuxi, and Shengjie is the great-grandson of Mr. Yiting. For generations, his family has been engaged in painting, and his family's knowledge is profound. He used to serve in the Ministry of Communications in the former capital. In his spare time, he immersed himself in the art world, and his attainments became more and more refined. Elder Fanshan once praised his works as being close to Yushan in elegance, and his style can be seen. He lamented the decline of Chinese painting, and specially exhibited his most refined works, as well as dozens of ancient calligraphy and paintings by famous artists of the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties in his family collection for appreciation. These ancient calligraphy and paintings are not only exquisite in their selection, but also, because they are from the collection of generations of painters, most of them are the masterpieces of various famous artists, and they are even more valuable for study. Therefore, the news spread widely and viewers followed closely. In addition to his own works, Mr. Qin is also willing to part with some of the ancient calligraphy and paintings for enthusiasts. It is heard that more than 20 pieces have been acquired by those who were quick to act.</p>
<h3>The Establishment of the Xiehe Amateur Opera Troupe</h3>
<p>Famous amateur opera singers He Jingshan, Xie Wenyuan, Xu Chengxu, Guo Xiaoxiao, Zhao Peixin, Sun Lanting, Gong Zhaoxiong, Dai Ronggui, etc., seeing that Peking opera will follow in the footsteps of Kun opera and be increasingly damaged, in order to preserve the national essence, organized the Xiehe Amateur Opera Troupe, specializing in the study of drama theory and rhyme. The association is located at the intersection of Xizang Road and Route Doumer. Yesterday, it was officially announced that the troupe has been established. Celebrities such as Du Yuesheng, Huang Jinrong, Zhang Xiaolin, Wang Xiaolai, Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, and famous actors such as Mei Lanfang and Cheng Yanqiu have all given calligraphy scrolls and paintings as gifts. It is heard that the members of the association are limited to those who already have a foundation in drama theory, with a quota of 30 people. The membership fee is ten yuan, and the monthly membership fee is five yuan. The quota has already been met. They are currently looking for experienced opera singers to be instructors.</p>

<h3>On Criticism</h3>
<p>— Lin Huiyin</p>
<p>Mr. Du Heng recently saw a literary cartoon: it depicted a child tearing a book, and the caption was: "He will become a critic." He was moved by this and wrote an article about criticism. However, the cartoonist's opinion is debatable because the child tearing the book doesn't necessarily mean that he is tearing it because the content is bad, just as he might drop a bowl because he finds it adorable, and the sound of it breaking is pleasant. Therefore, tearing a book is not necessarily a sign that the child will become a critic.</p>
<p>Although, I would also like to say something about criticism.</p>
<p>Criticism is now generally regarded as a tool for revenge. Often, when people see criticism of their work, the first thing they notice is not the criticism itself, but the critic. If the critic is someone they know, they will reflect on whether they have offended them in any way. If they cannot think of any offense they have committed, they will not understand why the critic is criticizing their work. However, in the end, they are usually able to find a reason, such as a rejected submission or a denied loan. They will then state the reason to prove that the criticism is only meant to settle a private score, as if to say that it does not harm their work.</p>
<p>If the author does not know the critic but only knows about them, they will quickly look to see if the critic has a group behind them, or to see what the real intention of the criticism is. Once they believe they have seen things clearly, they can then point out to the readers that they should not be fooled by the critic, that the critic has a group behind them, or that the criticism has some other purpose. If the critic's signature is unfamiliar, the author will either assume that it is someone's pseudonym and launch a counterattack against the person hidden behind the pseudonym, or they will simply ignore it, implying that the criticism is without merit.</p>
<p>Because criticism is only seen as a way to settle private scores, responses to criticism easily degenerate into personal attacks. The person being criticized does not address the criticism itself, but only the critic's personal characteristics. If they know that the critic has a gray hair, or has lost sleep once, or even that their father was an opium smoker, they will attack that point, in order to prove that the critic is not qualified to criticize their work.</p>
<p>In fact, criticism is just criticism. Why not seek truth and falsehood in the criticism itself? Is criticism really only a tool for revenge? And even if there was indeed some private feud between the critic and the person being criticized, and the critic's motive for the criticism was indeed revenge, if the criticism is accurate, can the person being criticized dismiss the criticism by saying what the critic's motive is? Does ignoring the criticism conceal the errors that have been pointed out in their work? If the criticism is incorrect, they can simply state why it is incorrect, and where it is incorrect, without having to pay attention to whether the other party has gray hair or has had a submission rejected.</p>
<p>Criticism is just criticism; there is no need to involve anything else.</p>
<h3>My Melancholy</h3>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>Leaning alone in the train car, I am aimlessly carried by the train to any place, but my heart will not settle. Like a shadow, it follows me: my melancholy.</p>
<p>But I do not complain, because it is so faithful.</p>
<p>The sound of the wheels grinding against the rails seems to be disrupting my nerves, so I lower the window; but there is still that sound, faint as it is, it weighs heavily on my heart. I continue to read a novel translated by a friend that I have already read more than half of, a story about two lost children meeting. After finishing the book, my eyes are wet, and I want to have the chance to cry my heart out, but I can't do that, because I know the person sitting across from me is watching my eyes.</p>
<p>"Where is the place I am going to?"</p>
<p>I ask myself this question. I can only lower my head and wait for the train to enter the station. Among a crowd of people, I walk aimlessly. I arrive at my home, and my home becomes so desolate.</p>
<p>Although it is already dark, I still go out. I pull up the collar of my coat, braving the chill of late autumn, walking slowly and alone.</p>
<p>By the time I return to my home, it is two o'clock after midnight.</p>
<p>That evening, an old acquaintance, whom I met by chance at a friend's house, told me so many things. Her body was trembling as she spoke of many regrets and hopes. Such a stubborn woman had become so weak.</p>
<p>I, who have seen the world as so trivial, am told that I am getting old and useless; but when I walk back, I feel sympathy for her pitiable appearance. My melancholy becomes even more profound. I know that there is one more person in this world enduring suffering. I even hate myself. For humanitarian reasons, I should not have responded to her narrative with a cold smile. She scolded me, and thinking about it, it was not an overreaction; because I was so wooden, like withered and broken grass.</p>
<p>Now I have to laugh, but sometimes my laughter makes people so unhappy. This time she also said: "Can't you stop for a moment? You know I'm so nervous." I saw her body tremble, tremble so terribly, although I knew that perhaps some kind of change had taken place in her heart, but I deliberately talked about the weather. "Do you feel cold?"</p>
<p>"Yes, an unbearable cold."</p>
<p>"Me too," I smiled, "otherwise I would take off my coat and give it to you."</p>
<p>"You are cold!"</p>
<p>She said the word "cold" so heavily, I knew her intention, but at most I could only shake hands with her like a friend.</p>
<p>If there is a desire to save people, I myself should be the first to be saved!</p>
<p>Then she said sadly:</p>
<p>"Remember me a little, as a friend, I know you are a good man, I want you to always be a good man!"</p>
<p>She turned around and walked away, and in the darkness, her dark figure quickly disappeared.</p>
<p>I returned to my home, regretting that I had seen her or had not been able to do what she wanted.</p>
<p>I know I am old, but my melancholy is so young, so strong, pressing on my heart.</p>
<h3>In the Teahouse</h3>
<p>— Peng Chenghui</p>
<p>It was June, and the sun was burning on the ground like fire.</p>
<p>There was not a breath of fresh air, even though we were in these lush mountains. The tall pine trees and short bushes were quietly gasping for breath under the fierce sunlight. The surroundings were very silent, with only the raucous calls of partridges echoing in the valleys and the clear, babbling sound of a spring flowing beneath the rocky cliffs. Because the weather was too hot, there were very few passersby. Even the men carrying salted fish, bolts of cloth, and ramie were rarely seen, although this path was the only mountain trail from Fengshuzhai to Hetianxu.</p>
<p>There was a teahouse located along this secluded mountain path. The teahouse was very small, with only a main hall, no rooms, and no doors. Inside, apart from a few stone benches, there were only a few cow dung pellets and dry firewood ash as decorations. On the center wall were the three large characters "An Lv Ting" [Peaceful Journey Pavilion]. On either side was a couplet made of bricks: the right side read, "Busy for fame, busy for profit, steal a moment from the busy to have a cup of tea." The left side read, "Suffering for clothes, suffering for food, find joy in suffering, grab a pot of wine." It seemed that the teahouse had a long history and had weathered many years of wind and rain and the erosion of frost and snow, so it already appeared ancient and dilapidated.</p>
<p>Grandmother was very old. Her skin was wrinkled like citrus peel, her body bent like a bow. Hunched over, she would always sit in this teahouse, dozing off all day long. In front of her was a table made of wooden planks, on which were arranged ten or so packets of Yunpian cakes, three or four tubes of small biscuits, several bowls of clear tea, and a dozen or so pears. These foods awaiting the patronage of passersby were her purpose for staying here every day, rain or shine.</p>
<p>Our home was a few mud houses built on the mountainside in front. There, sparsely scattered, were only ten or so households. At the moment, it seemed that no one was cooking, and there was no smoke rising from the rooftops. I and Xiaoqiu had just returned from grazing the cows on the mountain, and our stomachs were growling fiercely. Seeing the things in front of Grandmother, I felt saliva welling up in my mouth like a spring. The snow-white Yunpian cakes, the round biscuits, and the yellow pears seemed to have an immense attraction, and my eyes kept darting around them, almost to the point of calculating the exact number of each.</p>
<p>"Grandma! Just let me eat one!" I finally couldn't help but speak.</p>
<p>"Eat what?" She seemed a little deaf and widened her old eyes.</p>
<p>"A pear!"</p>
<p>"No! These were bought with money."</p>
<p>"What does it matter if I eat just one!"</p>
<p>"One costs seven or eight copper coins."</p>
<p>"I'm starving to death!"</p>
<p>"They're cooking at home, go home to eat!"</p>
<p>"They haven't started cooking at home yet! Look, there's no smoke rising from the roof."</p>
<p>Although Grandmother was very determined not to let me eat, I always refused to listen and kept pestering her, as if she were old and easily bullied. It seemed she would always agree to my requests, even if she scolded me a few times; I wouldn't take it to heart. She stood up and rearranged the things that made me salivate, as if she was wary of me reaching out to grab them automatically. Hearing me say that there was no smoke rising from the roof at home, she actually raised her head and looked ahead into the distance with her dim eyes.</p>
<p>"They should be cooking soon," she explained slowly.</p>
<p>"No, I want to eat one! I want to eat one, I'm starving to death!" I clamored, as if I had to achieve my goal.</p>
<p>"You're really naughty! I told you not to eat, but you insist on eating. In that case, pick a small one, one with worms!" She seemed to be overwhelmed and finally agreed.</p>
<p>I immediately smiled and reached out to take one. It was not the smallest or worm-eaten one, but the biggest, roundest, and yellowest one. The fragrance immediately wafted into my nostrils.</p>
<p>"Xiaoqiu, let's go to the mountain ravine behind to rub river snails, and come back to eat lunch," I said to Xiaoqiu after taking a bite of the pear.</p>
<p>"Okay, let's go!" Xiaoqiu saw that I had a pear to eat and was beaming as if he would get a share. He jumped down from the stone slab happily.</p>
<p>"Naughty brat! You have to eat such a big one when you eat it yourself!..." I heard Grandmother complaining, but I ignored her and jumped away with Xiaoqiu into the mountains behind the teahouse without turning my head.</p>
<h3>Literary Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Meng Yuan</p>
<p>(Two)</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Fuxi, who travels frequently between Shanghai and Hangzhou, recently went to Suzhou again to give a lecture on "The Joys of Life." His lecture is published in the fifth issue of the second volume of "Literary Tea Talks." After Mr. Sun spoke about the joys of life, the first being mutual assistance and the second being universal love, he used current events to prove his point:</p>
<p>"Now, the loss of the four northeastern provinces is a great shame for China, and we must do our best to win them back. However (the article suddenly shifts here! Meng's note), this cannot be achieved by weeping and wailing all day long. We should happily increase our knowledge and skills to compete with our enemies (this is what is called saving the country by focusing on our own work! Meng's note). It is like if a classmate insults me, I do not have to insult him back in the same way. Besides reasoning with him (this reasoning is not about eating tea! Meng's third note), I must work even harder myself (for example, Mr. Sun does not listen to cannons, but writes exclusively about chrysanthemums! Meng's fourth note). This is also a method of revenge, and it contains a great joy in life (which can also be said to have political implications! Meng's fifth note)."</p>
<p>Mr. Sun's philosophy of saving the country can be seen here. It is a pity that this philosophy does not have a general name, which is a bit of a flaw. I would very much like to give it the name "Tea Talk Salvation Theory." People who support this view would be called "Tea Talk Salvationists." I wonder if that is appropriate? Since ancient times, although "pure talk" has repeatedly misled the country, this "tea talk" is fundamentally different from "pure talk," and I think it will definitely not cause misunderstandings in various circles.</p>
<h3>The Two Brothers (60)</h3>
<p>— Guy de Maupassant, translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>They now stood upright in the brackish puddle, the water up to their thighs, their hands dripping on the shrimp nets, their eyes locked on each other.</p>
<p>She said in a joking, argumentative tone:</p>
<p>"You really picked a great time to talk to me about this! Couldn't you have waited until some other time to say it, so as not to interfere with my shrimping?"</p>
<p>He murmured:</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, but I couldn't bear to keep it to myself any longer. I've loved you for a long time. Today, you've intoxicated me even more, and I've lost my reason."</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, she seemed to accept her fate, abandoned the pleasure of shrimping, and reluctantly started to talk about serious matters.</p>
<p>"Let's sit on that reef," she said. "We can talk in peace."</p>
<p>They climbed up the slightly higher rock, and as they sat side by side on it, bathed in the sun, their legs dangling, she spoke again:</p>
<p>"Dear friend, you are no longer a child, and I am no longer a young girl. We both understand what this is about, and we can consider all the consequences of our actions. Now that you have decided to declare your love to me today, I naturally assume that you want to marry me."</p>
<p>He hadn't expected such a clear statement, and he replied dumbly:</p>
<p>"Of course."</p>
<p>"Have you spoken to your father and mother about this?"</p>
<p>"No. I wanted to know if you would agree first."</p>
<p>She extended her still wet hand to him, he quickly clasped his hand on hers, and she said:</p>
<p>"As for me, I am very willing. I believe that you are kind and sincere. But you must remember that I do not want to make your parents unhappy."</p>
<p>"Ah! Do you think my mother hasn't anticipated this? If she didn't want us to get married, would she love you as much as she does now?"</p>
<p>"That's true. I am a little worried about her intentions."</p>

<p>#### Financial Silver and Exchange Rates Suddenly Rise, Swap Gold Market Plummets, Ross's Account Purchases Gold Indefinitely, Unstable Dollar, Market Conditions Actually Become Unilaterally Bearish, Reaching Eleven Yuan, Current Swap Premium in the Market 8.78 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market deteriorated due to overseas telecommunications, and major bulls could not hold on, and successively cut long positions, which led to the gold price falling within the 710 yuan mark and failing to recover. The gold market, which had been firm for days, suddenly turned down yesterday and affected swaps. The premium also tended to weaken. In the early morning, overseas silver markets in the United Kingdom and the United States rose in unison. The forward silver price on the Five Metals Exchange also rose by 3.5% to 4%. Exchange rates also rose, and the price of raw gold did not move. American wheat fell by 1.5%, American cotton fell by 5 pounds, and stocks rose by 7.5%. The hair market opened and called 10 yuan, but then Huixiang, Ruikang, and Yiyu took advantage of the low to buy, and the market was still firm, and it rose. After the opening, the market was stable. Although the banks had a healthy appetite, the gold market was flat. However, due to poor market sentiment, retail investors depressed prices, and major players such as Fuchang, Hengyu, Senchang, Yonghong, and Xing successively sold, and the shorts took the opportunity to increase their bets. Reuters successively reported unfavorable news, such as US Congressman Rayner advocating the free minting of silver coins, and President Roosevelt deciding to continue buying gold indefinitely after meeting with his financial advisors at the White House, and the unstable dollar not quickly restoring the gold standard. The gold market became unilaterally bearish. In the after-hours market, Fuchang dropped a huge amount of long positions, and the premium was cheaper. The gold market was also weak, and finally flattened slightly. The raw red price was 1,075 yuan. The premium for the current swap was 8.78 yuan in the market. The market conditions for today will be recorded later.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 714.5 yuan, down 5.7 yuan from the previous closing. The goods opened at the same price. The exchange market opened with the near-term selling price of the pound sterling at 1 shilling and 3.5 pence, and the US dollar at 33.1875 yuan. Market sentiment was unstable. Although Hengtai and Hongli entered, and the banks were pulling, Hengyu sold strips, and retail investors took the opportunity to depress prices, and fell from 4.7 yuan to 3.1 yuan. Zhengjin continued to pull US dollars in April by 2.5%, although it rose by 1 yuan, but because Yuanmao and Yong sold strips, they learned that HSBC's sterling flat and the US dollar rose by 3.75, which was still downstream. However, it was still flat because Hengyu, Fuyu, and Hanheng entered. When Reuters had news that the United States was planning to freely mint silver coins, Dalian Gang Yuanmao, Yongyi, Yifeng, Yongheng, and Yu all sold. Anda offered US dollars in April by 3.75 and fell to within 2 yuan. Although Yongfeng, Changsheng, and Yonglicheng bought, it was difficult to sustain because Daxing and Yongfen sold. Market sentiment became even more timid after that, and the exchange market loosened greatly. Senchang, Yong, Fuchang, Bingxing, Yuanmao, Yongheng, Yu, Hongxing, Dadecheng, Shunli, etc. all sold strips. Reuters reported that the United States continued to buy gold, and unstable news such as the immediate restoration of the gold standard came. Although the US dollar in March was 2.5, there were no buyers and it broke the 10-yuan mark and fell to 08.7 yuan. Zhengjin ate US dollars in April by 5.625 and stabilized. HSBC and Mitsui even ate 0.5 yuan in the same month. Hengyu, Yiyu, Daxing, and Yong geng entered to 10 yuan and 08 corners. The news was even worse. Bingxing, Yuanmao, Yongyi, Da, Yonghengxing, and Fuchang, as well as Dalian Gang, sold again. US dollars in April were already made for 6.5, and the gold market was even more tired. At noon, the closing was 708.1 yuan, and the goods were auctioned at 8.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The after-hours market opened at 707 yuan, and the goods opened at 7.5 yuan. Shanghai blocked US dollars in March at 3.75, and once fell to 6.3 yuan because the swap was cheaper due to Fuchang's huge release, which led to the gold market's supply becoming eager. However, Huabi Shanghai pulled US dollars in March by 4.375, and Zhengjin Shanghai blocked the same month by 3.75. The market hovered and gradually rose to outside 8 yuan due to Shengsheng, Datianfeng, Yongyuansheng, Yong, etc. buying strips. Although Tongtaichang sold, the market still rose to outside 8 yuan. Maccalli HSBC pulled US dollars in March by 3.75, and the situation was quite intense. After that, the swap officially opened, and the premium was relatively high. Yi Da, Yong Yiyu, Yuanyuan, Cang Yong, etc. successively entered to 9.5 yuan. Shanghai blocked US dollars in March by 3.125, and Zhengjin blocked February by 0.0625, and the situation revolved again. The swap was also flat. Yuanmao Yong suddenly came to sell in the afternoon, and it fell to 8.6 yuan. Dachangxiang and others took the opportunity to buy strips, and the closing was 709.2 yuan. After the closing, Dafayong entered and the strips had risen to 10 yuan. Tongyi sold and the trend was flat again, and the goods were auctioned at 10 yuan. The highest price in one day was 714.7 yuan, and the lowest price was 706.3 yuan, with 8.4 yuan up and down. As a result, it fell 11 yuan compared to the previous closing.</p>
<p>Because HSBC Bank's US dollar exchange rate was raised by 3.75 to 31.875 yuan, the implied gold price was 730 yuan. According to the closing price, it was about 21 yuan weaker, 2 yuan more suppressed than the previous closing. The book value for this month was 714 yuan, and for January it was 708 yuan. The morning top-up water was 714 yuan, and the afternoon top-up water was 715 yuan. The January strips were uniformly made for 708 yuan. The raw red price was 1,075 yuan. There were not many transactions in the market. Tianjin Gang sold about 1,000 taels to Yingfeng Hengyue, and the price ranged from 1,075 yuan to 76 yuan. The after-hours market was quieter. There were 4,438 strips left for this month.</p>
<p>The market transaction was flat, and cutting long positions suddenly became popular. In summary, Fuchang, Hongxing, Senchang, Yong, Bingxing, Hengyu, Yuanmao, Yong, Zhaofeng, Chang, Dadecheng, Qianchangxiang, Zhengchang, Ruixing, Xianghe, Yifeng, Yongwan, and Shunli were on the selling side. Hengchang, Yongyuanxing, Yongrui, Kang, Hengtai, Fuyu, Yiyu, Yuanchun, Hengxingyuan, Hongli, Dafayong, Tianfeng, Hanheng, Hengxing, etc. were on the buying side. Changsheng Yonghui Xiang advanced and then exited. Dalian Gang Wanxing did more than 3,900 strips in total, netting out more than 2,400 strips. Shunli did more than 3,700 strips in total, netting out more than 1,100 strips. The Guang Gang Hengxing entered less than 100 and exited about 300. There were 31,836 chips in January in total.</p>
<p>The current (January to February) future had an initial call for shorts to post about 9 yuan. Fuchang, Hengyu, Fuyu, Dafengheng, etc. intervened, and the market went downstream. However, there were no transactions within 8 yuan. Hengxing, Bingxing, Renchangxiang, Tianfeng, etc. posted out and rose, but Hongxing, Hengyu, Fuyu, Zhifeng Yong, Dadecheng, Zhaofengchang posted in, and the market hovered at 8.34 yuan. However, a huge amount of effort was made to release swaps. Chunyuan Yongfu Yu Shenkang came to post in again, and Yongde Hengxing Shengsheng still posted out, and the situation was flat. Zhifeng Yong Huixiang Daxing Yong Guang Gang posted out quite frequently and then rose. Hengyu suddenly came to post out, and the official opening was 8.7 yuan. Hengxing Yida Yong also came to post out, and Zhifeng Yong Shenkang limited the market to post in, and then struggled to 9 yuan. Zhaofengchang, Hengchang Yongheng, Yu Runchangyu jointly dropped out the long positions and the market went downstream. The closing was 8.8 yuan. After the closing, Hengtai Yuanmao Yong Yuanheng posted in, and it fell to 8.56 yuan. Finally, Tongyi and others posted out, and Dachangxiang posted in, and it struggled again at 9 yuan, and there were few transactions.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Copper Coins Unchanged, Guangdong Copper Coins Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Jiangsu small foreign coins remained at 848 yuan in the morning, the same as the previous day. There were no price fluctuations in the morning, and transactions were made at the same price as in the morning. Morning transactions totaled 11,000 jiao, and afternoon transactions totaled 3,000 jiao. Guangdong small foreign coins were 796.9 yuan in the morning and 798 yuan in the afternoon, with a rise of 1.1 yuan in both sessions. However, it seemed to be more than 2 yuan better than the afternoon session of the previous day. Transactions totaled 40,000 jiao in the morning and 65,000 jiao in the afternoon. Copper coins remained at the same price as the previous day, at 291,000 wen, with transactions totaling over 26,000 strings, costing 10,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Relationship Between Silver Prices and Chinese Price Levels</h3>
<p>(Continued from the previous installment) By Lewis, translated by Zhang Luluan</p>
<p>If we take 1910 to 1914 as the base period, then the quantity of goods imported into China was 41.2 in 1887 and 186.8 in 1930, seemingly continuously increasing. However, on the other hand, the decline in the purchasing power of silver in the decade from 1923 to 1931 was unprecedented in history. Yet, China's population increased particularly rapidly. Since May 1931, China's price levels began to decline, and the index of imported goods also decreased from 186.8 to 160.8. In 1932, it was only 136.0. It can be seen that the magnitude of China's purchasing power is inversely proportional to the level of silver prices. However, the index for the three northeastern provinces in 1932 is only a rough estimate.</p>
<p>In gold standard countries, prices began to decline from 1929, and commerce gradually declined invisibly. Whether foreign goods or domestically produced items, transactions were extremely sluggish. In China, low prices have already caused farmers to experience acute hardship. If the decline continues, the current wage rates will inevitably be unsustainable, unemployment will increase, and various cooperative companies and banks will also suffer. Currently, the prices of agricultural products have made it difficult for farmers to repay debts and pay taxes. Since China is an agricultural country, when prices fall, rural prices are often worse than others. Therefore, the devastation of rural economies due to price declines in China is greater than in cities, which is completely different from the situation in other countries. Therefore, reducing the purchasing power of foreign goods in China is only one of the smallest manifestations of the various difficulties and dangers that arise after the increase in silver prices.

<h3>Bond Market Under Multi-Short Mutual Holding, Buying and Selling Opponents Are Difficult to Find, Market Prices Feel Slightly Distorted</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Stock Exchange, the market once again turned from rotation to stagnation. Major players rarely entered or exited, swap transactions also decreased, and buying and selling by various groups were not enthusiastic. Although the barriers on both sides were high, the stalemate remained unshaken. The rise and fall of the market depend on the strength of all parties. The volume of transactions has reached 60 million, but yesterday's entry and exit were only over 8 million, indicating the holding power of both sides. When the market opened yesterday morning, scattered sellers appeared, and the scene suddenly became deserted. If there was slightly more demand for one or two types, they were bound to raise the price by several jiao, so the price fluctuation was minor within one or two jiao. A few types in the middle were slightly better by one or two jiao to five or six jiao. Market prices were distorted because the transaction was too quiet, and it was not easy for both buyers and sellers to find corresponding opponents. In the second session, the 17th contract was slightly sold, but it seemed to be limited and unwilling to sell firmly. The market price fluctuated slightly by one or two jiao to three or four jiao. In the afternoon session, there were slightly more transactions, with the front slightly lower by three or four jiao and the rear slightly higher by two or three jiao. The resulting market price continued to be slightly lower by three or four jiao, except that the gold short was slightly lower by six and a half jiao. The current month for troop reductions and gold long was slightly better by one or two jiao. The long and short positions of both sides will be pushed forward when the situation changes. The total transaction volume was only 8.23 million. There were no spot transactions. Futures totaled 3.67 million for unified salt tax, 1.38 million for troop reductions, 825,000 for the 19 Customs, and 1.095 million for the 20 Customs. The rest ranged from 12,000 to 230,000.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Slightly Higher</h3>
<p>Xinhua Foreign Firm reported on the 14th: The New York stock market was generally slightly higher, but extremely sluggish. As the end of the year was approaching, traders were acting cautiously. Gold mining stocks rose the most due to the weakening US dollar and the gradual convergence of gold prices in London and the Liquidation Company. Tobacco stocks fell slightly due to a decrease in the production and sales of cigarettes in November. US government bonds were mixed, while foreign government bonds were firmer. Speculators were generally satisfied with the market situation, believing that the market had shown its ability to resist pressure. Total daily trading volume was 1.56 million shares. The wheat market was slightly lower, and the cotton market was sluggish, with the basis stable. It is likely to continue to fluctuate with gold prices. The Liquidation Company's purchase price of gold was $34.01 per ounce, unchanged. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 101.44 Up 0.75</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks 42.19 Up 0.20</p>
<p>20 Utility Stocks 24.13 Down 0.32</p>
<p>40 Bonds 83.34 Up 0.23</p>
<p>11 Commodities 47.78 Down 0.05</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: As the End of the Year Approaches, Yarn Sales Become Increasingly Quiet</h3>
<p>The yarn market is quite weak. As the end of the year approaches and the banks' closing period has arrived, the sales of spot yarn are sluggish, merchants have ceased operations, and yarn inventories remain high. Therefore, confidence is weak, but some believe that the bottom has been reached, and the desire to sell off is not strong, so the market has become stagnant.</p>
<h3>Human Bidding Declines</h3>
<p>The human bidding market opened earlier today, but with US cotton trending weaker, buyers in the market were not enthusiastic, and prices for each month fell by 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 jiao. In the afternoon, it was reported that the business of ready-made yarn was quiet, and prices for each month fell again by 1 and 2 jiao. The total transaction volume for the day was 6,850 bales. Of the sales, Tongji sold 250 bales, Mei Ji sold 450 bales, Mingde sold 350 bales, Dachangcheng sold 800 bales, and Changfeng sold 550 bales. Of the purchases, Yongda bought 200 bales, Changfeng bought 350 bales, Jinchang bought 350 bales, Deji bought 300 bales, and Dachang bought 200 bales. The closing prices are as follows:</p>

<p>February 1756 6 28,550 Total 115,500</p>
<h3>Customer Demand Stagnant</h3>
<p>The ready-made yarn sales market turned sluggish again. It is reported that the total number of bales bought by various merchants throughout the day was 215, and the market was average. The purchase amounts for each merchant are as follows:</p>
<p>Changsha 10 Nanjing 25 Mainland 134 Chi Tou 5</p>
<p>Jiangxi 20 Ningbo 11 Xiamen 5 Guangdong 10</p>
<h3>Poor Conditions, Standard Cotton Turns Weak</h3>
<p>The cotton market has turned weak, and the situation has become weak again. Because the condition is poor, the yarn market has declined, and the factories are struggling. They are not buying raw materials, and the sales market for ready-made cotton is quite stagnant. The market has shown a state of withering again, but the Ningbo merchants and Shanghai cotton merchants are still advancing and not giving up.</p>
<h3>Distant Month Cotton Loosens and Falls Half a Jiao</h3>
<p>The Zheng Standard market opened earlier today, but with US cotton slightly falling and the gold market falling, there were not many buyers in the market, and prices for each month fell by 1.5 jiao. In the afternoon, the market atmosphere remained flat, with near-month contracts up by 5 fen and distant-month contracts flat. The total transaction volume for the day was 31,600 dan. Of the sales, Dafeng sold 2,900 dan and Jinchang sold 2,500 dan. Tongxing sold 2,000 dan, and Yuanxingchang sold 800 dan. Of the purchases, Yuanda bought 3,000 dan, Chunji bought 1,000 dan, Yukang bought 1,500 dan, Yiyu bought 1,800 dan, and Yuanxingchang bought 2,200 dan. The closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Closing Price Increase/Decrease Inventory Zheng Standard Closing Price Increase/Decrease Inventory</p>
<p>December 3950 Down 10 90,000 March 3985 Down 15 184,600</p>
<p>January 5965 ... 185,500 April 4005 15 152,10</p>
<p>February 5970 15 215,200 Total 825,400</p>
<h3>Indian Cotton Continues to Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The business of ready-made cotton is still stagnant, but Indian cotton is gradually arriving in Shanghai. The sources include 470 bales of Yao cotton and 816 bales of Tong cotton.</p>
<p>The prices of ready-made cotton are as follows:</p>
<p>Pingguoer 54.00 Shenxin Factory 2,000 pieces Spot, ready to load</p>

<h3>The Third Estimate of National Cotton Production in the 22nd Year</h3>
<p>The China Cotton Industry Statistics Association announced the third estimate of national cotton production in the 22nd year at 5:00 PM on December 15, 22nd year as follows:</p>
<p>Cotton field area 40,453,953 mu</p>
<p>Ginned cotton production 9,621,240 dan</p>
<p>Abandoned field area 617,398 mu</p>
<p>The above estimates are based on (1) reports from eleven provinces including Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, as well as the two cities of Shanghai and Tianjin, (2) based on the cotton crop conditions before December 10, (3) the losses caused by disasters suffered by the cotton crop in various provinces before December 10 have been calculated, (4) the cotton field is in Chinese mu, and the cotton production is in dan (100 jin per dan).</p>
<p>The first, second, and third estimates of this year, the cotton field production in previous years, and the three estimates published annually in the past two years are compared below.</p>

<p>Second Estimate 39,684,369 9,838,286</p>
<p>Third Estimate 40,453,953 9,621,240</p>
<p>The cotton field areas of various provinces this year have increased in Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, Hubei, and Jiangsu, especially in Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Hubei, and Jiangsu. Planting cotton along the Pinghan railway in Hebei is developing, especially with foreign cotton. In recent years, Shanxi has seen a revival in cotton production due to its relative stability. Henan and Shaanxi have seen less warfare, and with cheap grain prices, cotton fields have increased. Jiangsu and Hubei have been recovering rapidly in recent years since the great flood of the 20th year greatly reduced cotton fields. Other provinces are also progressing year by year. Therefore, the total amount of cotton fields has been progressing with time over the past few years. This year, the rainfall between spring and summer in the north was abundant, and cotton crops were able to be planted and stabilized in time. This is a major reason for the surge in cotton fields in the northern provinces this year. However, Shandong has decreased slightly, and many fields were flooded in the autumn due to the Yellow River flood. Fortunately, the water receded quickly, and there was no total crop failure. Therefore, the national cotton field area this year reached 39.15 million mu in the first estimate. Because the first survey this year was earlier, the second increased to 39.68 million mu. This estimate exceeds 40 million mu, the highest figure in the last 15 years. Therefore, in terms of the national cotton field area, it can be said to be progress. This estimate can be regarded as the final actual amount, estimated at 9,621,240 dan, which is an increase of 1,515,603 dan compared to the 21st year, and an increase of 3,221,460 dan compared to the 20th year. The amount of production is not only unprecedented in recent years, but also the largest production number since the eighth year of the Republic. However, the increase in cotton production is not due to the abundance of the harvest, but to the increase in the cotton field area. After all, the cotton field this year is also the highest number in the post-Republic era. In terms of harvest, it is only a medium harvest. (The increase in cotton fields is mainly in the north because the chaos of soldiers and bandits has subsided slightly, and farmers are somewhat safe, coupled with good weather and sufficient rainfall, so the cotton fields have increased.) The average yield per mu in the first estimate was 27.2 jin, which was the largest number since the eighth year of the Republic. Therefore, at that time, there was hope for a bumper cotton harvest this year. By the second estimate, it had decreased to 24.8 jin. This estimate is further reduced to 23.8 jin, which is 2 jin higher than the final actual harvest of 21.8 jin in the 21st year, and is equal to the average number of 23.8 jin for the fourteen years since the eighth year of the Republic (23.8 jin per mu for the total number of fourteen years).</p>
<h3>Imported Foreign Cotton Since the Start of the New Cotton Season</h3>
<p>According to the report of the cotton surveyor of Gaulthier &amp; Company, the import of Bombay cotton in November was 1,300 bales.

The import of American cotton from August to September was 69,300 bales, and 14,055 bales in October, totaling 83,325 bales. Of these, 18,050 bales belonged to the American cotton loan. The import of Indian cotton from August to September was 7,244 bales, and the import in November was 7,160 bales, totaling 14,404 bales. In total, the imported foreign cotton since the beginning of the new total season has been 99,429 bales.</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Re-enters a Weak Path</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market was quiet and firm. The industry bought and rose, but then fell back as the bulls liquidated. As a result, spot prices fell by 5 pounds, and futures fell by 3-5 pounds. Liverpool cotton spot prices fell by 1 point, and futures fell by 1 point. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 1 point. The Bombay cotton market rose due to purchases by speculators and European exporters. As a result, Pingal remained unchanged, and Oomra Bairoxi rose by 0.25. The original telegram is recorded on the left (14th telegram).</p>

<h3>US New Cotton Average Bale Weight Report</h3>
<p>According to the report of Secretary Hester of the New Orleans Cotton Exchange, the bale weight of new cotton on the market this year, according to reports from various state ports and commercial ports, is as follows: This report refers to the period from August 1 to October 30.</p>
<p>State Name 1933 1932</p>

<h3>Grain Futures Market Softens</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market for each month showed a downward trend after initially stabilizing. The price of foreign wheat in Chicago fell by 2-4 jiao, and the price in Canada fell sharply by 1.5 jiao. The market atmosphere was initially stable, but later, as various factories sold off one after another, and customers in various places lost their appetite due to the situation, only Tianjin helped to cover short positions quite smoothly (about 100,000 bags), and some even sold back. Therefore, the market atmosphere gradually declined. By the afternoon opening, the market for each month was weak again. Because the foreign wheat tax has been increased, the surplus abroad is increasingly meeting China's purchasing power. Argentina and the United States have already matched, and Australian wheat was also being sold by foreign firms yesterday, shouting only 4.7 yuan including bags and tariffs, but the factories were still undecided. In this situation, coupled with the offerings from various factories, the market softened. As a result, this month fell by another 2 fen, January and February fell by 2 fen, and March to May fell by 2.25 li.</p>

<h3>Minister of Education's Higher Education Director Shen Pengfei Discusses Academic Degrees: Degrees Obtained Abroad Cannot Be Considered Chinese Degrees</h3>
<p>The Riri News Agency reports that recently, the educational authorities, considering that our country's academic degrees are based on those obtained abroad, which greatly diminishes the dignity of an independent nation, are planning to create our own degree system. Doctoral, master's, and bachelor's degrees will be determined through examinations. After this news was released, all parties paid close attention. A reporter from the Riri News Agency in Beijing specifically visited Shen Pengfei, Director of Higher Education at the Ministry of Education, to inquire about the content of the academic degree law. According to Shen, the drafting of the academic degree law did not begin today. Four or five years ago, when Mr. Cai (Yuanpei) and Mr. Jiang (Menglin) were ministers, they, along with Mr. Dai (Jitao), President of the Examination Yuan, drafted the principles of academic degrees and sent them to the Legislative Yuan for drafting. However, it has not been completed. After Mr. Zhu (Jiahua) became Minister of Education, he also had this intention. When Minister Wang (Shijie) took office, he inherited Mr. Zhu's intentions and discussed the matter with President Dai of the Examination Yuan. President Dai also eagerly wanted to complete this task. Currently, the draft academic degree law proposed by the Ministry of Education has been reviewed by the Examination Committee and sent to the Central Administrative Regulations Committee for discussion. After the discussion, it will be sent to the Legislative Yuan for drafting. The content cannot be disclosed because the discussion is not yet complete, but there are certain points that can be reported in advance: (1) Doctoral, master's, and bachelor's degrees obtained abroad cannot be considered Chinese doctoral, master's, and bachelor's degrees because the standards of degrees obtained abroad are not uniform. (2) Anyone who wants to obtain a doctoral, master's, or bachelor's degree must pass a rigorous examination by the government. It is stipulated that examinations will be held once every few years, and the number of candidates per examination will be limited to ten. Whether graduates of domestic national universities or private universities approved by the Ministry of Education can immediately obtain a bachelor's degree depends on the regulations of the academic degree law. It is still difficult to predict when the examinations will begin. In short, our country is an independent nation in the world, and it is necessary to have the freedom to grant academic degrees. This measure can not only maintain the dignity of the nation but also prevent domestic scholars from feeling suppressed. We sincerely hope that it will be implemented as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>The Essence of University Football: A Scene from Jiangda Football; Jinan and Jiaotong Meet Today; Starting at 2:30 PM in Xujiahui; Equal Strength on Both Sides, a Thrilling Battle Inevitable; This Battle is Key to This Year's Championship</h3>
<p>In this year's Jiangda Sports Association football championship, the most promising teams are Jinan, Jiaotong, and Fudan. Jinan has won four games in four matches, Jiaotong has won three consecutive games, and Fudan has only lost to Jiaotong once and has not yet faced Jinan. Currently, Jinan and Jiaotong are in a confrontational situation, which is the inevitable trend of Jiangda football over the years. However, for the past seven years, the championship has been difficult for Jinan to attain. This year, Jiaotong University has a wealth of talent, and the new generation of materials has surpassed the older generation. They have repeatedly shown their skills in both Chinese and Western football leagues, and their sharpness is extremely strong. Jinan's team is well-known and needs no further introduction. The two teams will meet at 2:30 PM today at the Jiaotong University Stadium in Xujiahui. The victory or defeat is related to this year's championship, so both sides are taking it very seriously and are being careful. There have been actions such as oaths before the game. There will also be a large number of diverse cheering squads to cheer at the venue, so the grand occasion is expected, and the game will be very exciting. However, it is still impossible to make a reckless statement as to who will win.</p>

<h3>Yesterday Evening's Western Youth Basketball: Maclaine Defeats Nanxing by a Large Margin; Eight Matches Today</h3>
<p>The Chinese teams in Western Youth Basketball lost last night. Nanxing was defeated by Maclaine by a large margin of 58 to 16. Maclaine has a center named Locke transferred from Beiping, who, although he looks like an ox, is surprisingly fast. He scored 24 points alone last night, and that was only half the time. The team now has a good chance of defeating the Pirates and claiming the championship. In the two B-group matches last night, Rowing won against French Army 39 to 19, and Russian Overseas Chinese won against Soochow 47 to 34. There are a total of four matches this afternoon starting at 2 PM, three in the B group and one in the A group. The results of yesterday's matches and today's schedule are recorded below:</p>
<p>Maclaine wins over Nanxing (A) Within two minutes, Maclaine's Locke and Mao Lai scored, after eight points, Nanxing's Zhang Daqi returned a goal. In an instant, Maclaine increased to 17 points, then replaced the entire team. They were approximately of the second-rate level, but still quite aggressive. The first half ended with 21 to 4, with Maclaine dominating. Nanxing was far behind. In the second half, Maclaine fought with the first batch of players again. Zhang Daqi and Bao Xindi each scored a goal once, seemingly gradually regaining vigor. When it became 49 to 15, Maclaine switched again to end with 58 to 16.</p>
<p>Russian Overseas Chinese wins over Soochow (B) Russian Overseas Chinese were strong and powerful. After scoring first, Soochow once led 6 to 2. However, when the opponent intensified its efforts, they could no longer continue. They were always trailing by a few points. In the end, Russian Overseas Chinese won with 47 to 34.</p>

<h3>Third Gongzhan Cup: The Chinese Team Loses the Championship by One Point; the Third Cycle: West 8 Points, China 7 Points; See You Again, Cheer on the Chinese Team</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of the Third Gongzhan Cup International Handball Tournament, due to the equal strength of both sides, after three weeks of hard struggle, the Chinese team was unlucky and lost the championship by one point yesterday, which is very regrettable. However, the fighting spirit and effort of our team members gave the Westerners a great impression. We will not lose our ambition due to failure, but instead, we will work harder in training, and there will be good rewards in the spring. Zhu Hong of the second group had many amazing victories the other day, so he was able to win two to zero straight. Hong Sun of the first group lost the first game, and then recovered the second game, but because the enemy was strong and enduring, the third game was powerless and defeated. Huang Cheng of the fourth group also had a good chance of winning against Pi'ai, but because the performance did not fully show its strengths, it was taken advantage of by the opponent, resulting in failure. The fifth group won without labor because the Westerners abstained. At that time, China and the West each scored two points. Hua Cai of the third group found it difficult to beat strong enemies, but Hua Cai both had excellent and beautiful results, creating a good record. The younger generation is to be feared. The results of the five groups are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Klamei Maluofu (West) (21|1116|2121|6) Hong Yuqiu Sun Daosheng (China)...Two to One</p>
<p>(2) Zhu Kuan Hong Rulin (China) (21|1121|6) Bu Jinshi Pierce (West)...Two to Zero</p>
<p>(3) Chaka Lian Roberts (West) (21|821|11) Cai Tongshou Hua Fenggang (China)...Two to Zero</p>
<p>(4) Pearson Eyre (West) (21|1421|11) Huang Kehua Cheng Zhenhua (China)...Two to Zero</p>
<p>(5) Gao Zishou Sun Baoqi (China) wins (Heqinzixi Erdun) (West) Abstains...Two to Zero</p>

Soochow, though outstanding in the Wu region, was ultimately defeated. After the opening, Lin Jianxue scored one point because Hou Mulin committed a foul. Hou Mulin atoned for his fault, and Soochow took the lead with a score of 2-0. Zhu Peifeng committed another foul, and Gong Desheng scored twice, giving Jinling a 3-2 lead. Hou Mulin made a successful long shot, and Soochow regained the lead with 4-3. Lin Heipi got excited and made a long shot that missed, but he followed up with a close-range shot, successfully scoring twice. Jinling took a 7-4 lead, and Soochow requested a time-out, but it had no effect. Lin Heipi scored again, and Jinling's score steadily increased. Although Zhou Bencai of Soochow made some amazing shots, it was not enough to help. At the end of the first half, Jinling won by 19 to 9, leading by ten points. In the second half, Soochow suddenly changed its strategy. Hou Mulin launched an attack from the center, which proved effective. Zhou Bencai lurked on the left and scored even more points. Although Lin Mopi of Jinling scored twice, the score gradually narrowed. Zhu Peifeng of Soochow had a moment of inspiration and made a long shot that went over the beam and straight into the net, making the score 18-23. Soochow was only five points behind. The Jinling players looked at each other in dismay and requested a time-out to slightly diminish the opponent's momentum. When the game resumed, Jinling suddenly became active, and Heipi was particularly commendable. Soochow's energy had waned, and they only relied on long shots. Jinling then won the quarter-final spot with a score of 41-28.</p>

<h3>Wu Qu'an's Views on Studying Literature</h3>
<p>— Yan Qiao</p>
<p>Mr. Qu'an is a modern expert in lyrics and music, has in-depth research in Chinese literature, and is also an old professor. He was very young when he first taught at Soochow University, and now he has more than 30 years of teaching experience. The day before yesterday, he came to the Literary Society of Soochow University to give a lecture. Because I had some things to do, I could not stay until the end, and only heard the first section of his "Views on Studying Literature," which was about antithesis. He said that antithesis is a habit of people. For example, when saying a sentence, one must cite an example. If that is not enough, add another one. This is the origin of antithesis.</p>
<p>Later, my friend told me that there were three more sections below. The second section was about the Book of Rites, saying that after reading a book, one should write down one's心得（心得 means: what one learned, thought, or felt）The third section was about reading articles, saying that articles must be read, and must be read with enthusiasm. If you don't read, you won't be familiar with it. To be enthusiastic, you must read it. Most people don't read now, so they can't be called scholars, but only book readers. The fourth section was about recognizing characters, saying that mispronounced words are very jarring and make people feel that the person is uneducated. Although these four points are clichés, they are very practical, unlike those speakers who talk about the sea and the sky, only winning applause from the audience, and after counting, there is nothing to be gained.</p>
<p>I think the fourth section is the most meaningful, and the social habits are even more ridiculous. For example, the character 廬 (Lú) in Mount Lu is clearly pronounced Lǘ, but people in Shanghai insist on pronouncing it as Lú. The character 龔 (Gōng) in Gong Ding'an is clearly pronounced Gōng, but people in Suzhou insist on pronouncing it as the level tone of the character 炯 (Jiǒng). However, comparatively speaking, people in Shanghai mispronounce more words, such as the character 樂 (Yuè) in military band, which is pronounced as Luò. The character 娛 (Yú) in entertainment is pronounced as Wù. Previously, there was a restaurant called Yihong Restaurant, and they pronounced the character 倚 (Yǐ) as the character 奇 (Qí), but no one called the novelist Bi Yihong as Qi Hong.</p>
<p>What is even more inconceivable is that the five characters 美麗川菜館 (Měilì Chuāncài Guǎn, Beautiful Sichuan Restaurant) are divided into two parts: 美麗川 (Měilì Chuān, Beautiful Sichuan) and 菜館 (càiguǎn, Restaurant).</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of International Diplomacy</h3>
<p>— Xiao Ying</p>
<p>As I have heard: In the front and behind the scenes of diplomacy, there have been some interesting anecdotes. Some were ignored by people at the time, and some were unknown to the outside world. Although they are not of great importance, they are still interesting to talk about afterwards. I have selected them here to bring a smile to your face.</p>
<p>During the September 18th Incident, it is said that our Ministry of Foreign Affairs had difficulty obtaining accurate information for a while, so when foreign news agency reporters went to inquire about the news, they did not have a concrete answer.</p>
<p>When the situation in the Far East was tense, the State Department in Washington became the center of international politics. Once, our Minister Shih Shih-hsuan was meeting with Stimson when the Japanese Ambassador Debuchi Katsu suddenly arrived uninvited. The clever American diplomatic doorman, on the one hand, invited Debuchi to another room, and on the other hand, took Shih's hat and coat and waited by the door to avoid the trouble of the diplomatic representatives of the two countries meeting.</p>
<p>When the League of Nations discussed the Northeast issue, the Japanese representative Yoshizawa suddenly announced that he would speak in Japanese. For a time, newspapers spread that Mr. Yoshizawa was not good at French; but according to those familiar with the inside story, Mr. Yoshizawa was not ignorant of French, and the reason why he relied on a translator was to prepare a place to deny it if there were any modifications in the prepared speech.</p>
<p>British diplomacy is known for its gentlemanly attitude; however, when The Hague discussed the German reparations issue, Snowden used extremely stupid words to scold the French representative, because this man was not a diplomatic talent and the situation was urgent, so he spoke without thinking.</p>
<h3>Brief Thoughts</h3>
<p>— He Shan</p>
<p>Sugar-fried chestnuts; of course, they are delicious, and I love to eat them too.</p>
<p>Early this morning, about nine o'clock? Two modern ladies got on the streetcar. As soon as they sat down, they opened a paper bag of sugar-fried chestnuts and started eating them. Using their bright red fingernails, they peeled the chestnut shells and put them into their bloody mouths one by one. They ate, talked, and laughed. Just as they were happily eating, an old foreign lady next to them immediately put on a straight face and said: "This is First Class. Please Don't!" The two ladies smiled cheekily and replied in broken English, "All Right!" and immediately put away the paper bag, still talking and laughing nonchalantly. When the streetcar arrived at the Bund, the old foreign lady got off, and the two ladies started eating again, scattering chestnut shells all over the floor.</p>
<p>This small, accidental event raised several questions in my mind: First, if these two ladies were foreign misses, I wonder if the old foreign lady would have interfered in the same way. Second, the common advertisements on the streetcar are nothing more than prohibitions on spitting, smoking, and pulling the bell, as well as several wooden signs on rules about preventing theft and checking monthly tickets, but I have never seen a notice prohibiting eating sugar-fried chestnuts. I don't know which rule this old lady relied on to have the right to interfere. Third, the old lady said this was first class, but I don't know what the difference between first class and third class is besides the different fares.</p>
<p>But we can't blame others too much, or blame ourselves too little. Although everyone loves to eat sugar-fried chestnuts, for these two ladies to eat sugar-fried chestnuts early in the morning, after already having eaten breakfast (which they probably already had), is probably not hygienic. Even if they wanted to eat, why did they have to eat them on the streetcar? After being advised not to eat, why did they make such an ugly scene after the old lady left? It's really incomprehensible.</p>
<p>Littering fruit shells on the streetcar is fundamentally a problem of public morality. To be honest, the public morality of our esteemed countrymen is not very good. It is not unreasonable for the old foreign lady to interfere with the Chinese ladies eating sugar-fried chestnuts, but to treat them with harsh words and a stern expression in international etiquette seems unreasonable, right?</p>
<h3>Baffling</h3>
<p>— Ji Ren</p>
<p>Shops, although they post "Discount Sales at a Loss" at the entrance, according to the shop owner, can still make money, which is baffling.</p>
<p>It is said that Chinese people are now beginning to be patriotic and are not buying Japanese goods, but according to customs surveys, the import of Japanese goods is increasing day by day, which is baffling.</p>
<p>Chinese students in Chinese schools are almost indifferent to Chinese literature, but they are diligently studying foreign literature, which is baffling.</p>
<p>The four northeastern provinces are lost, but now people are saying "Never Compromise," and have forgotten about "Recovering Lost Territory," which is baffling.</p>
<p>Superstition was overthrown long ago, temples were destroyed, and clay Buddhas were overturned, but now writers are shouting "Oh God!" "Oh Jesus!" in their so-called modern articles, which is baffling.</p>
<h3>The Connection Between Cheng Xiaoqing and Jiangnan Yan</h3>
<p>— Bi Weng</p>
<p>My friend Xiao Yue has spent much effort and care on detective novels. He has racked his brains, thought deeply, and wrote diligently, never giving up until recently, such as the collection of Huo Sang Detective Cases, sequel, a huge book. Huo Sang, in fact, does not exist as a person, just like the English writer Conan Doyle and Sherlock Holmes. Mr. Cheng is extremely patriotic, and has always taken the task of elaborating the essence of Chinese culture through science as his duty, so whenever he creates something, he always touches on the common knowledge of physical and chemical evolution, and the interconnection of the main lines is like tasting a persimmon, which contains a long aftertaste, quite unlike the criticism of adding twists and turns. This can be said to be its greatest strength.</p>
<p>The novel "Jiangnan Yan" is Mr. He's debut work, which was published in the Xianshi Amusement Park Daily, and there is a separate edition. However, the book is already out of print in the market. The book describes "Jiangnan Yan" raising funds for a poor people's orphanage, so he borrowed the family's secret "Cat's Eye" as collateral from a local tycoon. The tycoon's daughter, because of her father's illness, personally went to Huo Sang to ask him to keep it in custody on her behalf. Huo believed that Yan's intelligence was no less than his, so he deliberately set up various traps to avoid miscalculation. And "Jiangnan Yan" was very powerful and never entered Huo's trap. The two heroes used their intelligence, which was quite painstaking. In addition, there were the tender emotions of children, villains pretending to collect money, and the assistant's recklessness, being tricked, etc., which added beautiful materials to the warm and tense atmosphere, making readers forget their fatigue. One cannot reach this point without a quick mind and a clear pen.</p>
<p>In recent years, the style of movies has gradually moved towards the right track, and detective works can really help education. Therefore, the film company should choose the best and make more of them. My friend Youlian Company, through my introduction, took the novel "Jiangnan Yan" and adapted it into a film drama. This film is already being released to introduce it to those who love to read Mr. Cheng's works and love film art.</p>
<h3>Four Northeast Company Commanders</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 20: Divination Brings Good Fortune, the Old Man Smiles Every Day; Dispelling Sorrow is Endless, Old Friends Live Across the Street</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang said: "Please come into the house and sit down." Old man Zhao chuckled and walked into the house. He no longer had his dry tobacco pipe in his hand, and he kept rubbing his palms together. Gui Zhi had her hair half-dishevelled, and was sitting half-slumped on a square stool near the door, her face sallow, clearly showing signs of illness. When she saw Old man Zhao enter, she stood up, called out in a low voice "Old Master," and stood by the door without moving. Old man Zhao said: "I heard that you caught a cold, are you still not well?" Gui Zhi smiled, revealing two rows of white teeth, and said in a soft voice: "It's much better now, I've been lying down for two days. Old Master, where's your dry tobacco pipe? Are you not smoking?" Old man Zhao was just about to sit down on a chair, when he heard these words, he stood up again, touched his beard with his left hand, and pointed at Gui Zhi with his right index finger, laughing: "It's all because of your affairs that I'm so happy. When your mother said to call Zi Qiang back for the wedding, I was overjoyed and couldn't help but clap my hands and shout 'Good!' This dry tobacco pipe followed the commotion and also stomped its foot on the ground. It didn't matter that it stomped its foot, but it made a somersault and broke the mouthpiece. Breaking it is fine, consider it helping me out." Mr. Jiang laughed: "Old Master is too frugal, how much money can you spend on smoking dry tobacco in a month? You still have to take this opportunity to forget smoking." Old man Zhao reached into his pocket, took out a box of cigarettes, held it up, and said with a smile: "I can't bear to buy cigarettes, the money for a box of cigarettes can at least be used to smoke dry tobacco for six or seven days. But since the dry tobacco pipe is broken, I'll take the opportunity to buy two boxes and smoke them. These are Beauty brand, Madam, would you like to smoke one?" Mr. Jiang couldn't help but laugh and say: "This is really the dry tobacco pipe's mouthpiece helping you out, since the dry tobacco pipe's mouthpiece is broken, you're smoking Beauty brand cigarettes." Old man Zhao laughed and said: "Dear lady, you can count that as scolding me, an old antique like me, what's there to talk about beauty or not beauty, I'm just picking a new type of cigarette to smoke and try it out."

<h3>The Latest Automatic Frequency Adjustment Method</h3>
<p>— Ming Xiang</p>
<p>Ordinary radios have three adjustment knobs: volume control, tone control, and the most important frequency adjustment. The first two have already had automatic control methods invented. This journal has previously written about it, but only the most important frequency adjustment has not been heard of being able to use automatic methods.</p>
<p>Frequency adjustment of radios is done in the input circuit of each stage (except the sound frequency amplification stage), using an inductor and a capacitor to form an adjustment circuit. Changing the capacitance of this capacitor allows the intrinsic frequency of the circuit to resonate with the frequency of the radio waves emitted by a certain station, and then the signal from that station can be received.</p>
<p>Recently, a British radio magazine published a very interesting automatic frequency adjustment circuit. This circuit can resonate with radio waves of any external frequency without adjustment. The component that achieves this automatic adjustment goal is still the soul of radio, the vacuum tube.</p>
<p>Anyone with some radio knowledge probably knows that there is a certain static capacitance between each electrode inside a vacuum tube. A few years ago, scientist Miller discovered that this capacitance is not the same when the vacuum tube is heated and cooled. Not only that, but the amount of its change depends entirely on the vacuum tube output and the type of circuit used. In other words, the capacitance between the filament and the grid of a vacuum tube can be changed due to the effective total impedance of its output circuit.</p>
<p>If an inductor is connected in the screen circuit of a vacuum tube, the total impedance of the screen circuit must automatically increase as the frequency increases, thus affecting the capacitance between the grid and the filament. Therefore, we can design an inductive output circuit so that the capacitance between the grid and the filament automatically increases at long wavelengths and automatically decreases at short wavelengths, thus completing the automatic adjustment goal.</p>
<p>The circuit is shown in the figure. The input circuit of the screen grid amplifier tube does not need to be adjusted, but the grid and filament of a triode are connected in parallel with the coil L1 to replace the usual variable capacitor. Its screen is connected to the positive pole of the B battery through a load inductor Z. If the frequency of the external signal changes, the effective inductance of Z in the screen circuit of the automatic adjustment tube also changes, thus the capacitance between the grid and the filament also automatically changes, still maintaining its resonant state.</p>
<p>Of course, a pre-selector must be passed before this type of circuit, otherwise radio waves of any frequency will resonate at the same time, and the sound emitted by the radio will inevitably be chaotic and impossible to select and distinguish.</p>
<h3>How a Direct Current Uses a Transformer</h3>
<p>— Shi Huayu</p>
<p>Don't we often say that direct current can't use a transformer? Why can't it? Isn't the primary coil of a low-frequency transformer usually connected in series with the plate circuit of a detector tube? Isn't the detector tube plate current pure direct current? Why can it use a transformer? It turns out that induced current is generated because the conductor is moving in a magnetic field, or the magnetic lines of force passing through the coil change. The so-called direct current output of the detector tube plate circuit is actually a fluctuating direct current. After passing through the primary coil of a low-frequency transformer, it generates changing magnetic lines of force. These changing magnetic lines of force pass through the secondary coil, so an induced current is generated in the secondary coil. In short, as long as the magnetic lines of force passing through the secondary can change, an induced current can be generated. The one that causes these magnetic lines of force to change can be alternating current or pulsating direct current, both are fine. A stable battery current can also be used if it is interrupted. Now, if we apply a  current (Break) to the primary of the transformer, an induced current will be generated in the secondary. If the number of turns of the secondary and primary coils are in a certain ratio, then the voltage of the primary and secondary will also be in a certain ratio, thus completing the purpose of boosting or reducing the voltage. Now that we understand the above principle, direct current can also use a transformer to boost or reduce its voltage.</p>
<p>An ordinary alternating current radio's power transformer can be slightly modified to be used for direct current power. As shown in the figure, T is the power transformer. M is an electromagnet, and Q is a steel sheet. Its installation is exactly the same as a doorbell, but the higher the vibration frequency of Q, the more advantageous it is. When QD is cut off, that is, when they are not in contact, the secondary S will generate current. The capacitor has a larger capacity, about between 2Mfd and M8fd. Because when the primary circuit is cut off at point QD, due to the self-induction of the primary, sparks must occur between QD, thus forming an oscillator. Therefore, the opening and closing of the primary circuit is affected, and the cutoff is delayed, and high electromotive force cannot be generated. If a C capacitor is added, the self-induced current flows into the capacitor, no sparks are generated between QD, and rapid cutoff can be obtained to generate high electromotive force. As for the thickness of the coil wound on M, it should be the same as the primary to minimize losses.</p>
<h3>Dual-Tone Loudspeaker</h3>
<p>— Chun</p>
<p>Because ordinary components, even the most precise speakers, cannot achieve the goal of making the music broadcast on the radio station received in the radio fully clear, people began to try to use a dual-tone loudspeaker device. I found several reference materials in RadioCraft, adopted the most complete one, and experimented several times. The sound received is very clear, both the subtle and the most grand parts. I think this dual-tone loudspeaker has satisfied my desire. This method is also very simple and easy to try. All it costs is two transformers, two capacitors, and one more speaker. Two output vacuum tubes are also required. Now, let's take the simplest circuit to illustrate. On any radio, you can connect two speakers in this way to become dual-tone.</p>
<p>As for the installation, the styles of the two speakers are different. The larger the mouth of the speaker, the clearer the low-frequency sound is emitted. Conversely, the smaller the mouth of the speaker, the clearer the high-frequency sound is emitted. Therefore, in the installation of a dual-tone loudspeaker, one speaker should use a narrow diameter, and the other should use a large diameter. It is best to use push-pull transformers to leave room for tuning the scales and compensate for the deficiency of capacitors. The capacitors I personally use have seventeen pieces, and 0.0025 is generally used as the standard. If there is noise in the speaker, you can connect the center tap of the push-pull transformer (primary middle) to the positive terminal of the B battery. But if the installation is proper, it is not necessary to connect it. This can only be determined based on the results of experiments, and it cannot be fixed whether it needs to be connected or not.</p>
<p>The advantage of this dual-tone loudspeaker is that it does not distort the original sound. You might as well try it.</p>
<h3>Improvement of Using Low-Frequency Transformers to Replace Filter Chokes</h3>
<p>— KMK</p>
<p>Generally, amateur radio researchers all consider economic aspects. For example, in alternating current radios, most researchers use low-frequency transformers to replace the filter chokes in the rectifier section. Although this is convenient and economical, it has a shortcoming, that is, the alternating current sound cannot be completely filtered out, which is a pity. Because the current is input from point F, and suddenly changes its direction of flow between GP, resulting in an unstable direct current output from point B. At this time, an annoying alternating current sound will occur in the radio. When there are the above-mentioned disadvantages, a 2Mfd fixed capacitor can be connected between GP and the negative terminal (as shown in the figure) to remedy the situation.</p>
<h3>Small Experiences</h3>
<p>— RF</p>
<p>Hard Rubber Dislikes Sunlight</p>
<p>Products made of hard rubber should not be exposed to sunlight. Because over time, the power of sunlight can cause a kind of decomposition reaction in hard rubber, causing a part of the sulfur in the hard rubber to form a thin layer and remain on its surface, resulting in the disadvantage of leakage current and losing its insulation effect. Therefore, hard rubber used for high-voltage insulation must pay attention to this point. If it can be replaced with bakelite material, it is more appropriate.</p>
<h3>Winding of Non-Inductive Resistors</h3>
<p>The resistance of resistors wound with resistance wire often produces back electromotive force due to the effect of induction. To avoid this disadvantage, the winding method should use a non-inductive one. The method is as follows: A. Fold the wire at the midpoint of its entire length so that the two ends meet, and then wind this double-stranded wire in the usual way. B. Divide the wire into several layers and wind them in opposite directions on each layer. (That is, the first layer is opposite to the second layer, and the second layer is opposite to the third layer.)</p>
<h3>Polarity Test Paper</h3>
<p>When using direct current, if you cannot determine the positive and negative poles, you can distinguish them with polarity test paper. Manufacturing method: Take one gram of phenolphthalein, dissolve it in a small amount of alcohol. Take a pinch of salt and dissolve it in a cup of water. Then mix the two liquids, take Chinese paper and cut it into small strips, wet them with this solution, and then dry them in the shade to form the test paper. Usage: Take a strip of this paper and wet it with water. Separate the two poles of the electricity slightly and touch them to the paper. The electrode that emits bright red color near it is the negative pole. The principle: Because the current flows through the salt solution, light sodium hydroxide is generated at the negative pole due to electrolysis. Light sodium hydroxide is an alkaline substance, so it reacts with phenolphthalein to emit red color. (Note: Phenolphthalein is sold in instrument stores and Western pharmacies.)</p>
<h3>Internal and External News</h3>
<p>The Philips Foreign Company in this city is displaying its five-tube and six-tube radios and various radio parts in the Hamilton Building. Many people watch it every day.

It has been found that since the company started business, although it has only been a few months, it has repaired hundreds of radios, and all customers are satisfied. Therefore, I dare to introduce it on the right.</p>
<h3>Radio Knowledge</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiancun</p>
<p>(Twenty-one) Overview of Vacuum Tubes (5)</p>
<p>(8) Quick-heating AC tube (Quickbeatertype): AC tubes are most popular with side-heated ones because they are convenient, and many people like to use them. However, there is a disadvantage, that is, the heat emitted from the heating part (Hoater) must be conducted to the cathode through an insulator, so its starting work is delayed. To remedy this shortcoming, small holes are opened in the insulator so that it can supply heat by radiation. Although this design can speed up the starting work of the vacuum tube, on the other hand, the higher the quick-heating property, the easier the AC sound is to occur. Therefore, the manufacturer must appropriately select the compromise point between the two so as not to lose sight of the other. At present, the vacuum tube with relatively quick-heating property is the Philips brand, and its starting work time is usually between ten and thirty seconds.</p>
<p>(9) Pentode for high frequency: Because the tetrode has secondary electron emission, the plate voltage and plate current cannot be changed greatly. This state has been described. To make the plate voltage change greatly, it is necessary to increase the value of the plate voltage. It is quite easy to increase the plate voltage for AC radios or fixed battery radios; however, for mobile or car radios, it is hoped that the number of batteries will be reduced as much as possible, so the plate voltage cannot be increased. So the pentode appeared to solve this kind of difficulty, and it was initially limited to low frequency use. Recently, various pentodes for high frequency have also been produced one after another. For example, the RCA No. 239 tube can be used for radios in a car, and the RCA No. 34 tube can be used for DC portable radios. They can be used for amplification at high frequency and intermediate frequency, as well as the first detection of non-grid heterodyne, but it is impossible to use them for ordinary plate detection.</p>
<p>The so-called new tubes No. 57 and No. 58 produced in the past year are AC versions of pentodes for high frequency. Their filament voltages are all 2.5 volts, and their plate voltages are even increased to 250 volts, which is unprecedented, commonly known as AC 2.5 volt tubes.</p>

<h3>The Lifeline of the Electrical World</h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>It is said that the island country to the east divides demarcation lines on the map, calling them "lifelines." The area they consider the first lifeline has long been made into a pseudo-country, and at the same time, about 15,000 kilometers of our country's communication lines have also been lost; but since the territory has been lost, these mere lines are not worth mentioning. We can only sigh with emotion about this! What is there to say! 丨丨 What is there to say!</p>
<p>The "lifeline" referred to by the Japanese is a euphemism for aggression. In fact, it has nothing to do with the survival of that country and cannot be regarded as necessary for life; however, the term "lifeline" is quite novel in terms of meaning. If it is applied to telecommunications, it is also quite accurate. After all, in the telecommunications business, "lines" occupy an important position. Whether it is wire telegraphy and telephone, or even radio, why don't they use sky-earth lines? They are scattered like stars, just like the nervous system of the human body. If telecommunications are considered to have vitality, then this kind of line that reaches all parts of the country can certainly be regarded as the "lifeline" of telecommunications traffic.</p>
<p>Since electrical wires are related to traffic, just as described above, similar to human life, then rectifying old lines is no different from prolonging the old life of telecommunications; constructing new lines is also no different from creating new life for telecommunications. Since it is related to life, it naturally cannot be ignored. Therefore, successive traffic authorities have spared no effort in the facilities and progress of lines. To mention recent events, whether it is Jinpu or Jinghu, they are all planning to rebuild or build new lines to connect long-distance telephones, and the original important trunk lines of Pinghan, Longhai, Huhan, Qinghu, Hanyu, and Jinpu are also successively repairing and replacing wooden poles on a large scale (wooden poles can be regarded as supporting objects for the lifeline) and sorting out the lines; in addition, in the bandit suppression areas and important areas, specialized personnel are also deployed to engage in line repair. It is because of this that telecommunications can maintain smooth operation; the hope for the life of telecommunications seems to lie here as well. It has been found that the machines installed in the bureau are as important as the lines. If electrical wires are regarded as "lifelines," then why can't machines be regarded as "vitality"; however, "a lifeline," vitality must ultimately rely on the application of a lifeline. I am only providing a strained interpretation, I hope you will not misunderstand the meaning of the words).</p>
<p>To go a step further, electrical wires are not only regarded as life in telecommunications traffic, but also ordinary people who do not care much about them usually feel full attention to the blockage of lines after turmoil; otherwise, since the Minbian Incident, the electric wires on the edge of Zhejiang have been obstructed all the way, how could it cause various rumors? Once restored, how could it make people feel a little settled? There is a relationship here. Although it is not direct, it can also indirectly infer the situation and fate. Who says it is not appropriate to call it a "lifeline"?</p>
<h3>A View of the Telegraph Bureau, Past and Present</h3>
<p>— Zhe Sheng</p>
<p>My country has been running the telegraph for more than 50 years. From being run by officials and merchants, to being supervised by officials and run by merchants, to being taken over by the state, due to the different nature, the change of the times, and the change of the environment, all systems and atmospheres have also gradually shifted and gradually changed the old view. Now I will list the points where we have felt the differences between the past and the present in recent years:</p>
<p>1. Business In the past, the telegraph bureau was similar to the Baojia Bureau and the Smuggling Bureau. Notices were posted on the wall, and a tiger plaque was hung on the door, which was like a government office. People who entered the bureau to send telegrams were like villagers paying land tax to the government office, bowing their heads and not daring to speak much. The officers and clerks in the bureau who received and sent telegrams sat arrogantly, as if they didn't see them. Receiving telegrams had to be done at their convenience, and scolding would follow if they didn't agree. The sender would retreat obediently and dare not argue. Today's telegraph bureau is different. The setting of the telegram receiving and sending office is like a store. The receiving and sending personnel are also mostly friendly and polite, and treat the telegram-sending public like a store treats customers. When there are inquiries, they will answer sincerely, and the change will be fair. Each bureau also has so-called business inspectors, who check all day long whether the messengers are delaying the delivery of telegrams or extorting translation fees, and also inquire about the opinions of the general public on the business of the telegraph bureau, so as to improve it at any time to meet the needs of the public. The telegraph bureau in the style of a government office in the past has now become a commercialized and public-oriented institution. In the old days, the price was increased according to the province and region, that is, a certain amount was added for each province. It was both cumbersome and expensive. Later, it was changed to two types: this province and another province. In recent years, it has been changed to a uniform price, which is the same in all provinces, which is much more convenient. The names and addresses of the recipients of Chinese telegrams are often as many as seven, eight, or more than ten characters, resulting in a telegram fee of several yuan, which the general public often finds too expensive. Since the implementation of the telegram registration method, only one registered character can be used to replace the name and address of the recipient. Recently, in busy cities, telephone numbers can be used to replace the address of the recipient, which is even more convenient. In addition, there are New Year's telegrams and social telegrams, which are inexpensive and without delay. There are many innovations in business.</p>
<p>2. Telegraph Service In the past, telegraph bureaus of all sizes transmitted telegrams with Morse telegraph machines regardless of the complexity of the telegraph service. The transmission rate was slow, and there was a risk of congestion in busy circuits. Now, all busy telegraph bureaus are equipped with Non-Weston express machines, and many have switched to duplex communication, that is, two bureaus can send telegrams simultaneously on the same line. The increase in the transmission rate of the Beijing and Shanghai bureaus, which have recently added new Kexin express machines, is more than double. In the past, telegraph operators valued official and military telegrams and ignored ordinary commercial telegrams (that is, private telegrams). Now, commercial telegrams and official and military telegrams are equally important. According to the author's investigation, telegrams between Shanghai and Hankou, Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, etc., although thousands of miles apart, can sometimes be received and sent by telephone at both ends, and the telegram can be received within ten minutes. The speed of transmission is surprising. Reduced price news telegrams are also sent as soon as they arrive without any delay. During the National Games held in the capital this time, the transmission of various sports news was extremely fast, which won a lot of praise from the media.</p>
<p>3. Personnel In the Qing Dynasty, the chief of the telegraph bureau (that is, the current director) was mostly a candidate official or a descendant of a noble family, with a full official air. Therefore, the entire bureau was also dyed into a bureaucracy, such as calling the director "Your Excellency" and calling the telegraph operators "Master". There were many levels within a bureau. The equipment in the bureau, except for the telegraph bureaus in a few busy cities, was very corrupt. Telegraph operators also had no proper entertainment in their spare time. Since the revolution, the bureaucratic habits have been gradually eliminated. The director is often a reformer, and the knowledge and hobbies of the telegraph operators are also very different from before. Each bureau has organizations such as book and newspaper clubs. In their spare time, they read books and newspapers to increase their knowledge, or exercise to cultivate their spirit. In the past ten years, publications in the telegraph industry have also sprung up like mushrooms after rain, competing to show new sprouts. Among them, such as Telecommunications Friend, Telecommunications Magazine, Current, Electric Bell, Telegraph Key, Electrical Engineering, and Electric Light, are all valuable publications in society. The football teams, table tennis teams, and Go teams organized by telecommunications colleagues also often compete with the outside world and achieve results. They are enthusiastic in contributing to the national salvation work, such as donating to the Northeast Volunteer Army, donating to the 19th Route Army, and donating to aviation construction. Therefore, today's telecommunications personnel have become prominent in society, unlike the obscurity of the past.</p>
<h3>Simultaneous Telegraphy and Telephony</h3>
<p>— Wang Dachun</p>
<p>In the same electric wire circuit, the method of installing telegraph and telephone for simultaneous communication is called Simultaneous Telegraphy and Telephony. This simultaneous communication method is further divided into two types: one is a Simplex Circuit, that is, only one telegraph circuit is installed in one telephone circuit. One is a Composite Cfrcuit, in which two telegraph circuits are installed in one telephone circuit. In our country, the places where the simultaneous telegraphy and telephony method is applied to long-distance telephone lines are not common. In the past, the long-distance telephone circuit between Zhenjiang and Yangzhou used two telegraph working lines to form a circuit. Both parties talked and sent telegrams, and the results were very good. The application has also been for many years. Later, the underwater cable crossing the Yangtze River was broken by the anchors of ships and was lost and could not be repaired. This communication method has been abandoned for a long time. It is now heard that the Ministry of Communications is planning to set up long-distance telephones along the Beijing-Shanghai Highway, and there is also a proposal to install a simultaneous telegraphy and telephony method. I will not hesitate to talk about its outline, which is expected to be welcomed by the readers.</p>
<p>The principle of a single-circuit is actually the same as the principle of a phantom circuit, as shown in Figure A: R and R1 are telegraph machines. C and C1 are condensers, whose volume is usually 2m·f·oT and T1 are telephones. L and L1 are long-distance telephone lines. is a Retardation Coil. The resistance of this plug flow line is usually 50 ohms. Its connection method is connected from the telegraph machine, like the extension of two arms, and the telephone and the external line are connected in parallel, so that the telephone at both ends is connected into a loop. The resistance of these two arms is usually adjusted to a balanced state. In this way, when the telegraph machine is communicating, the potential caused in the telephone line at the same time is equal. Therefore, the communication current flowing through the telephone line does not flow into the telephone loop due to the balance of the potential of the two lines, and the receiver in the telephone does not feel the sound from the telegraph machine. Similarly, when the telephone is communicating, the alternating current generated is also due to the thinning of the potential of the two lines and the capacitance of the capacitor in the telegraph circuit, so it does not disturb the work of the telegraph.</p>
<p>As for the connection of the complex circuit, it should be as shown in Figure B. 11 is a 50 ohm plug flow line wheel, 12 is a 30 ohm plug flow line wheel, C is a 2mF capacitor, R is a telegraph machine, and T is a telephone. The figure shows one telephone circuit and two telegraph circuits. The principle of this complex circuit is slightly different from that of a single circuit.</p>
<p>The principle is that the inductance number of the plug flow line wheel is large, the direct current is easy to pass through, and it is particularly difficult for high-frequency alternating current to pass through. On the other hand, the capacitor in the circuit has the opposite effect, that is, the alternating current passes through the capacitor without any obstruction, and if the direct current passes through, it will be cut off by it. In other words, the telephone current is a high-frequency alternating current, and it cannot flow through the circuit with a large inductance coefficient. At the same time, the telegraph current is a signal current, which is a direct current, and it is also impossible for it to pass through the circuit with the capacitor connected in series. According to this principle, the simultaneous telegraphy and telephony method of the complex circuit can be constructed.</p>

<h3>Improvement of Telegraph Business in the Past Year (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Liu Junxiang</p>
<p>(8) Entrust China Travel Service to collect travel telegrams Travelers who want to inform their relatives and friends of their whereabouts at the port or station, but the telegraph bureau may not be nearby, so they have no way to achieve their purpose. Even if the telegraph bureau is nearby, the berthing of the boat and vehicle is only temporary, all the time</p>
<h3>Important Information for Telegram Inquiries</h3>
<p>— Qinghua</p>
<p>(II) Sages for Telegram Inquiries:</p>
<p>1.  Correcting or Supplementing the Recipient's Name and Address: If, after sending a telegram, the sender discovers that the recipient's name and address were written incorrectly, or if they receive a notification from the telegraph office that the telegram cannot be delivered due to an unclear or incorrect recipient name and address, they may present the original telegram receipt to the telegraph office and send a paid official telegram to correct or supplement the recipient's name and address. For example, if the original telegram was "Huafeng Company, Beijing Road, Shanghai," and it cannot be delivered due to an unclear address, the sender may request a supplement to "Huafeng Company, Donghai Lane, Beijing Road." Or, if the original telegram was "Mr. So-and-so, Central Trading Company, Nanjing," and after sending the telegram, the sender suddenly receives a telegram or letter from the recipient stating that they have moved to the Overseas Chinese Hotel, they may request a correction to "Mr. So-and-so, Overseas Chinese Hotel, Nanjing," so that the receiving office can attempt delivery again.</p>
<p>2.  Correcting or Supplementing the Text: If, after sending a telegram, the sender discovers an error in the text, they may present the original telegram receipt to the telegraph office and send a paid official telegram to correct the text. For example, if the original telegram text was "Funds can be remitted on the 6th," and due to a miscalculation of the date, it is intended to change it to the 7th, a request can be made to change the second character "six" to "seven." Additionally, if the recipient has doubts about a certain sentence in the received telegram and sends a paid official telegram to inquire, the sending office, upon receiving this official telegram, will notify the sender. If the sender wants to clarify things for the recipient, they can supplement the text. For example, if the original telegram text contains the phrase "Goods not shipped," and the recipient is in urgent need of the goods and does not understand why the sender has not shipped them, or suspects that the character "not" is a mistake for "already," and sends a paid official telegram to inquire, the sender may supplement the original telegram text to "Goods damaged, delayed shipment." In the above situation, the paid official telegram fee for the recipient's request to resend the three characters "Goods not shipped" cannot be refunded. The paid official telegram fee for the sender's supplemental text should also be paid separately, because the telegraph office is not at fault.</p>
<p>3.  Canceling a Telegram: If, after sending a telegram, the sender wishes to cancel it for some reason, they may present the original telegram receipt to the telegraph office and send a paid official telegram to cancel the original telegram. This paid official telegram is charged at a rate of only four characters. If the original telegram has already been delivered to the recipient, the receiving office will notify the recipient to cancel the original telegram, rendering it invalid.</p>
<p>4.  Inquiring About No Reply: If, after sending a telegram, the sender waits a long time and the recipient still has not replied, they may send a paid official telegram to inquire. There are two ways to inquire: (1) Inquire whether the telegram has been delivered properly. (2) Inquire why the recipient has not sent a reply telegram. Both of these paid official telegrams require prepayment of the reply telegram fee. If a reply from the receiving office by mail is desired, only the postage for the reply letter needs to be prepaid.</p>
<p>5.  Inquiring About the Recipient's Registered Abbreviation: To save on telegram fees, if the recipient has a registered abbreviation at the receiving office, the sender can use the registered abbreviation instead of the recipient's name and address. However, if the memory is unclear, the telegraph office can be consulted for the telegram registration compilation. However, if there are errors in the registered abbreviations published in the compilation, or if the recipient has already terminated the registration, the telegraph office is not responsible if the telegram cannot be delivered.</p>
<p>6.  Inquiring About Telegram Rates: If the sender needs to inquire about domestic or international telegram rates, they can use the telephone or visit the telegraph office in person to inquire. If many telegrams are sent each month, a rate table can be obtained from the telegraph office for reference at any time.</p>
<p>7.  Inquiring About Line Conditions: To facilitate the sender in specifying the line through which the telegram is transmitted, the line conditions can be inquired about by telephone or in person at the telegraph office at any time. However, the telegraph office delivers received telegrams according to regulations, using the fastest transmission line. Only the transmission lines for international telegrams are divided into wireless and submarine cable. The sender can specify any of them arbitrarily. In general, wireless circuits are mostly direct circuits and use high-speed automatic telegraphy transmission (not manual telegraphy), so they are extremely fast and accurate.</p>
<p>8.  Applying for a Refund: The refund of telegram fees should be applied for by the payer (i.e., the sender) to the sending office within six months from the date of sending the telegram. (However, the refund of prepaid reply fees should be applied for within three months.) If a refund is requested due to excessive delays or non-delivery of the telegram, a certificate issued by the receiving office or the recipient should be attached (in case of delayed telegrams, the original copy of the telegram received by the recipient can also be attached). If a refund is requested due to errors in the telegram, the original copy of the telegram received by the recipient should be attached. However, it should be noted that if the recipient has already inquired about and corrected the telegram error with the receiving office, or has inquired about and corrected it with the sending office using a paid official telegram, a refund cannot be applied for again.</p>
<p>Sending telegrams is also particularly difficult. In view of this, the Ministry of Communications, for the convenience of travelers, has specially launched a type of travel telegram, entrusting the China Travel Service, which has been handling travel business for many years, to conduct pilot projects in Nanjing, Shanghai, Peiping, Tianjin, Hankou, and Qingdao. The results were good and immediately considered for promotion. When travelers travel to the above-mentioned places, when boats and vehicles are parked, if they want to send ordinary urgent domestic telegrams, they can hand them over to the China Travel Service or the reception staff dispatched by the company for collection and forwarding. In addition to the long price, no handling fee will be charged. This is the convenience of communication without extra cost.</p>
<p>9.  Creating Social Telegrams: In daily social interactions, the people of our country almost exclusively correspond through Western letters, and rarely send telegrams. This is because the people of our country have not yet developed the habit of using telegrams, and the high cost of telegrams is also a major reason. The Ministry of Communications originally had a New Year's telegram, which was open once every year around New Year's and Christmas, charging a quarter of the ordinary telegram price. However, the time limit for this telegram was limited, and the scope was too small, so the effect was not significant. Now it has been expanded into social telegrams, which can be used for celebrations of New Year, Christmas, weddings, birthdays, childbirth, opening, and promotion, condolences for funerals and illnesses, and thanks for the above-mentioned matters. The price per word is two cents for Chinese within the province, four cents for between provinces, and double for English. Moreover, for this telegram, not only can the receiving office provide free translation of incoming telegrams, but the sending office can also provide free translation of outgoing telegrams. The procedure is simple, the transmission is fast, and the cost is low. Its benefits to social interaction are truly significant, and for the telegraph business itself, it is no less than opening up a new field. Its future development can be predicted.</p>
<p>10. Newly Compiled Roman Alphabet Telegraph Code: The telegraph code numbers used in our country use four numbers to replace one Chinese character. Now, the Ministry of Communications has recompiled a new edition of the clear and secret code, improving the content. The most distinctive feature is that each Chinese character is not only affixed with a numeric code as before, but also a Roman alphabet code. The Roman alphabet code is composed of three Roman letters, and each group replaces one Chinese character. The sender arranges the groups of Roman letters in sequence, and then divides them into foreign words of ten letters each. In this way, ten Chinese characters can be replaced by three foreign language cipher words consisting of thirty Roman letters. The current international rates are extremely expensive, requiring two or three yuan per word. If this method is used, a lot of money can be saved, which is particularly convenient for overseas Chinese to communicate with their motherland.</p>
<p>In summary, the improvements in telegraph business within a year have been significant. From the perspective of the business itself, backlogs have been eliminated, and the business has been expanded. From the perspective of senders and receivers, costs have been reduced, telegrams are sent more conveniently, and telegrams are received more quickly. In short, the promoters strive to achieve maximum results with maximum effort, and senders and receivers can enjoy the highest communication convenience with the lowest cost. If we can continue to move forward in this direction, the future of the telegraph business is promising.</p>
<h3>New Discovery of Positive Light Electrons</h3>
<p>— Zhang</p>
<p>As far as we know, atoms are only two basic electrical units, that is: negative light electrons (ElectronNegatif) and positive heavy electrons (ProntonPassitif). However, British scholar Blackett and Italian young scholar Occhialina photographed the movement of the above two types of electrons and discovered a third particle whose weight is lighter than that of positive heavy electrons. As a result, the basic electrical unit positive light electron, which is recently recognized by the scientific community, was established.</p>
<p>The new electron differs from other electrons in two ways: first, it carries a positive charge; second, its life lasts only a few thousandths of a second. The new electrical unit has already been photographed by the Cambridge Laboratory in the UK and can be identified on the photos.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned British and Italian scholars also proved that although the new electron and the positron that make up the atom carry the same type of electricity, its weight is 1,800 times lighter than that of the electron, and when it encounters a negative electron, the life of the positive electron immediately stops. Its only expression of survival is a sudden emission of radiation during its tremor. There are now more than twenty photographs showing several light tubes of new electrons, and their latent power is as high as hundreds of millions of volts.</p>
<h3>Telegram System Between Japan and "Manchukuo" (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Ye Zhonghua</p>
<p>This article was published in the September issue of Japan's "Teishin Zasshi" and was written by a Japanese national from the Foreign Correspondence Section of the Ministry of Communications' Telegraph Bureau. Its purpose is to explain the current situation of Japan's control over the Eastern Province's telecommunications administration. The article involves a review of Japan's management of the Eastern Province's telecommunications administration before the September 18th Incident, which can provide a glimpse into the historical stages of Japan's aggression against our country's telecommunications administration. Therefore, it is urgently translated to share with the people of our country. (Translator's note)</p>
<p>On August 31, the Ministry of Communications issued Instructions No. 35 and No. 36, formulating the Japan-"Manchukuo" Telegram Regulations and the Japan-"Manchukuo" Wireless Telegram Regulations, which were implemented on September 1. At the same time, the original Sino-Japanese Telegram Regulations and Sino-Japanese Wireless Telegram Regulations were declared abolished. These new regulations are closely related to the telecommunications and telephone services of the Eastern Province, both Manchurias, the Daodjie territory, and "Manchukuo," which are unified and operated by the Manchuria Telecommunications and Telephone Corporation, which goes without saying. Its main purpose is that the telegram system between the Kwantung Leased Territory and the South Manchuria Railway Affiliated Area and Japan, and the telegram system between "Manchukuo" and Japan have different prices and other handling methods. These two jurisdictions are very inconvenient due to geographical relationships. This unified plan is to equalize the prices and handle them in the same way in both jurisdictions. Before explaining the revised telegram system between Japan and "Manchukuo," we should first briefly describe the telecommunications business that Japan used to operate in Manchuria.</p>
<p>Japan's Telecommunications Business in Manchuria</p>
<p>To understand Japan's telecommunications and telephone business in Manchuria, we must at least go back to the era of the Russo-Japanese War in the 37th and 38th years of the Meiji era. At that time, Japan had set up military telecommunications and telephone lines in various parts of Manchuria during the war. When the war ended, Japan leased the Kwantung Leased Territory and the South Manchuria Railway Affiliated Area according to the Treaty of Portsmouth. At the same time, the submarine cables laid between Lushun and Zhifu and the cables in the South Manchuria Railway Affiliated Area were also included. The handling and use of the above cables and submarine cables were based on the treaty signed by the Chinese and Japanese governments in the 41st year of the Meiji era, and the communication of telecommunications between the Kwantung Leased Territory and the South Manchuria Railway Affiliated Area and China ("Manchukuo") was also implemented according to the above treaty. At the time of the Manchurian Incident, all telecommunications connections between the Kwantung Leased Territory and the South Manchuria Railway Affiliated Area and today's "Manchukuo" were only in Changchun, Tieling, Shenyang Yuanyang, Niuzhuang, and Andong. Its main methods of use were (1) Sino-Japanese cables, which were connected at the boundary of the South Manchuria Railway Affiliated Area, for the use of telegrams between the Kwantung Leased Territory and the South Manchuria Railway Affiliated Area and China (including Manchuria) and other countries outside China. Communication to the Japanese mainland had not yet been opened. (2) That is, Japanese telecommunications receiving and sending offices were set up in the above six Chinese telecommunications bureaus to connect with the Japanese bureaus in the affiliated area. This telecommunications connection was for Japan's exclusive use and was handled in the same way as the domestic communication (referring to the Japanese mainland) of the Japanese bureaus in the affiliated area. After the Manchurian Incident, telecommunications connection lines inside and outside the affiliated area were added, and direct communication between the North Manchuria area and the Japanese mainland was also opened. This point will be further elaborated on below.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned telecommunications connection between Japan and "Manchukuo" was only along the South Manchuria Railway Affiliated Area. Up to today, the communication facilities between Japan and "Manchukuo" have been completely changed after the Manchuria Telecommunications and Telephone Corporation invested in the operation, and the company operates as a whole!</p>
<p>Telecommunications Business between the Kwantung Leased Territory and the South Manchuria Railway Affiliated Area and Japan</p>
<p>The telecommunications business in the Kwantung Leased Territory and the South Manchuria Railway Affiliated Area is different from other Japanese colonies because it is special. Therefore, the telecommunications system between the area and Japan is also different from domestic telegrams or colonial telegrams in Japan. However, the difference lies in the regulations on prices, which should follow the old Sino-Japanese telegram system. As for other items, they are all handled in the same way as domestic telegrams in Japan. (The price of Sino-Japanese telegrams is omitted)</p>
<p>Telecommunications Business between "Manchukuo" and Japan</p>
<p>The connection lines in the six locations of the South Manchuria Railway Affiliated Area were exclusively for communication between the Kwantung Leased Territory and the Affiliated Area and China and other countries outside China. Domestic communication in Japan could not be used as an example. Therefore, there was no direct telecommunications connection between Japan and the current "Manchukuo" before the Manchurian Incident. Therefore, in the past, communication between "Manchukuo" and Japan had to be transferred through the submarine cables between Nagasaki and Shanghai, or between Qingdao and Sasebo, and according to the expensive prices of Chinese landlines. On the one hand, Sino-Japanese telegrams only reached the post offices along the South Manchuria Railway Affiliated Area. In addition, there was no other proper communication method, so the inconvenience of communication for Japanese residents in Manchuria until recently was beyond imagination.</p>
<h3>South Manchuria News Agency: Domestic Chinese Telegram Price Reduction</h3>
<p>The name and address of the recipient of a Chinese telegram often exceed ten characters due to the nature of Chinese characters. Therefore, each telegram fee often costs one or two yuan, so people are reluctant to use telegrams. The Ministry of Communications is now reducing prices from January 1 next year for the purpose of thoroughly facilitating public communication and developing business, as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The name and address of the recipient of a domestic Chinese telegram and the name of the receiving place do not exceed 15 characters, all are charged as five characters, and if this is exceeded, the fee is added by the character.</p>
<p>(2) For those who use telephone numbers instead of addresses, the name of the recipient and the name of the receiving place are charged as four characters in total.</p>
<p>(3) Those who use telegram registration instead of name and address will still be charged according to the regulations, that is, including the name of the receiving place, Chinese Mingyu telegrams will be charged as three characters, and Chinese password telegrams will be charged as two characters.</p>
<p>(4) For split telegrams, add three characters for each additional recipient's name and address. After the above method is implemented, an ordinary 20-character telegram (assuming the name and address is 15 characters and the telegram text is 5 characters) will only be charged as ten characters, which is equivalent to a 50% discount, just like a big price reduction in a store!</p>
<h3>Reduction in the Price of Domestic Urgent Telegrams</h3>
<p>Domestic urgent telegrams are charged three times the price of ordinary telegrams. The Ministry of Communications is now reducing the fee to twice the price of ordinary telegrams from January 1 next year to facilitate merchants and bring it in line with international urgent telegram fees. After this method is implemented, merchants who send urgent telegrams for urgent business information can save one-third of the cost.</p>
<h3>Plan to Improve Telegram Receiving and Sending Procedures</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications recently convened personnel in charge of receiving and sending telegrams from the telegraph bureaus and radio stations in Beijing and Shanghai to the ministry to hold a meeting to study the improvement of telegram receiving and sending procedures in order to increase the speed of telegram transmission. It is reported that the results were very satisfactory. The principle decided was to reduce all unnecessary procedures and strive to send telegrams as soon as they are received, and reduce delays at the receiving and sending offices. Procedures such as registration flow and calculation of the fees for ledger telegrams (that is, telegrams sent by business firms that have prepaid telegram fees and do not pay for telegrams by the telegram) are handled after the telegrams are sent. In this way, telegrams can be sent quickly on the one hand, and senders do not have to wait for a long time and waste time on the other hand, which is a major improvement in telegram business.</p>

<p>Talk</p>
<h3>Classical and Modern</h3>
<p>— Zilin</p>
<p>Yes, everything here is modern. The lights, beds, windows, sofas, dressing tables, and the color of the walls, although not as exaggerated as the "subjective" decoration advertised, but at least it cannot be regarded as modern. Even the waiters are very young, with their hair combed smoothly and wearing neat, modern uniforms.</p>
<p>When I walked into that newly opened hotel, I first felt that Shanghai was really different from before and had become much more modern. At the same time, I also thought of our traditional Chinese decorative art that emphasizes symmetry and balance, such as the couplets hanging in my home before, "A window contains the eternal snow of the Western Ridge, and boats moor at the Eastern Ying from ten thousand miles away." Now it has been broken through by modernity.</p>
<p>But when I opened the window, I immediately smelled a puff of opium smoke coming from the window next door. At this time, I was fully aware that I had returned to China. Then, from the window on the left, came the sound of mahjong tiles clashing and women laughing.</p>
<p>But strangely, in such a modernly equipped place, there are very few modern young men to be seen. Most of those who come and go are black men wearing melon-shaped hats and dark crystal glasses. They are a bit like the heads of some agencies, or small and medium-sized merchants and landlords who have come to Shanghai from the mainland recently. Later, I read a book by Mu Shiying called "Cemetery," and then I suddenly realized that the modern young people were probably dancing jazz with more modern girls in more modern places than here. I didn't expect that after not coming to Shanghai for a few years, even I have become an outdated person!</p>
<p>The night is getting deeper, but there are still many women coming and going in the corridor. Long eyebrows, flat noses, long earrings, black hair hanging in front of their foreheads, collars so high that they can't turn their necks, blood-red lips, two-inch high-heeled shoes. I really haven't seen Chinese women for a long time, and I find them particularly interesting, but as soon as I see them wearing the most modern high-heeled shoes, but still walking with a splayed gait, I can't help but sigh that although people are modern, they still carry some ancient Chinese style!</p>
<p>All night long, I smelled the smell of opium smoke and the sound of mahjong. In such a sleepless night, I can't help but think of the different styles of smoking opium. For example, Lao Chen, who is from our hometown, is a plasterer. His opium pipe and lamp are always ready. As long as he has time, he can lie under the shade of a tree or in a quiet place in a dark alley and smoke a few puffs casually. This is one style. There is also the old scholar in our hometown who teaches "Confucius said." In addition to teaching, he is always lying on a couch all day long, with the oil lamp as small as a bean, smoking slowly and delicately. After smoking enough opium, he raises his hand, raises his foot, stretches his voice, and talks at length about ancient and modern times, and then shakes his pen and writes out famous sentences such as "Closing the door and shutting the household, covering the thatched fence." These two styles of smoking opium can probably be said to be romantic or classical. As for the middle-aged man with a handlebar mustache who lives next door to me, he is lying under the pale green light and on a "cubist" wooden bed to smoke opium.</p>
<p>This style of smoking is the first time I have seen it in my life. I think this can probably be said to be realistic or modern!</p>
<h3>Stinky Tofu</h3>
<p>— Wei Zhen</p>
<p>"Stinky tofu! Three copper coins for two pieces!" A crisp and audible call, along with an indescribable fragrance, spread around an alley. The sister-in-law in the pavilion on the second floor, the mother of Ah Gou in the pavilion on the third floor, the wife in the front room, the young lady in the back room, the apron aunt... like flies seeing sugar, they gathered naturally with warbling voices, surrounding this load of stinky tofu so tightly that no water could leak through. You buy four pieces, I buy six pieces, so that the one who combines several positions - shareholder, manager, and salesperson - the fried tofu vendor is so busy that he can't handle it, tearing open his golden-toothed oily mouth that can't close, drool adding fragrance to the tofu, constantly spraying...</p>
<p>Praising the fragrance when buying flowers is people's habit. No one wants to add ugly nouns to their own goods. However, the one who sells stinky tofu not only doesn't praise his own goods as the best, but also loudly tells people that it is stinky. I think: The most honest people in the world are only them! Originally, their business could not be done, no, the facts tell me that many people flock to it! It can be seen that, whether it is a thing or a person, there is no need for people's praise and ridicule, only the actual and true flavor of itself, and there is no need to be afraid of being abandoned by society! Stinky tofu can give us good evidence.</p>

<h3>The Last Night at the Jai Alai Palace</h3>
<p>— Yun Chi</p>
<p>Here, you can find two different kinds of gamblers: one is the bourgeoisie who have no other way to kill time, and the other is the unemployed masses who have absolutely no way out. The former only uses money as a game, while the latter stakes their lives. Those who use money as a game often win money, while those who stake their lives are certain to lose their lives.</p>
<p>Lukov has not been himself since he started gambling on jai alai: his eyes bulge, his cheeks are sunken, and his grayish-yellow complexion is like that of a chronic lung disease patient. In his heart, he also knows that this is a last resort. However, because he cherishes life so much, he does not hesitate to use his life as a stake: if he doesn't gamble, he knows he will commit suicide in the future; if he gambles, maybe he will have a chance to turn things around. Thus, he became a seeker of disillusionment day and night.</p>
<p>Borrowing and pawning methods have been exhausted, and even the idea of stealing sometimes flickers in his mind. "When life comes to an end, what else is there to be afraid of doing!" He often thinks like this. But, he still doesn't have that kind of courage after all.</p>
<p>Today is Lukov's last night to go to the Jai Alai Palace. From borrowing and pawning everywhere, he scraped together twenty dollars. In the eyes of others, this meager amount is nothing. But he thinks of it as the price of life. If he wins, he can still eke out a living; if he loses, the whole family will perish together.</p>
<p>He prayed to God, bid farewell to his wife, mustered his courage, and went straight to the dazzling neon lights of Avenue Albert, as solemn as if heading to the battlefield.</p>
<p>He sat alone in a corner, intently watching the movements of the entire team of players. The images of six first-tier players, Lamos, Shatelanggu, Erga, Albati, Cuban Dragon, and Houlando, swirled in his mind.</p>
<p>Lukov watched several games before deciding to stake the twenty dollars on Erga. This is the twelfth game, and Erga is placed in number six. "The rest are all favorites, even if they win, you won't win much money. Only Erga's number six is really cold. If he wins, a ten-dollar ticket will be worth at least one hundred dollars. And Erga is playing well today, so let's risk life on it!" After thinking this, his feet involuntarily walked to the place to buy tickets.</p>
<p>With trembling hands, he took out two ten-dollar bills from his pocket and exchanged them for two red and green pieces of paper.</p>
<p>The bell ended, and two referees walked out from inside. When Lukov saw them, he felt as if they were executioners killing him. Suddenly, there was a silver whistle, the whole place was silent, and even the radio stopped singing obediently.</p>
<p>Lukov stood in front of the wire fence, his heart pounding.</p>
<p>His hot blood surged with the sound of the ball, and his eyes followed the players. Suddenly, it was Erga's turn to play. He mustered up more courage and shouted loudly at the wire fence:</p>
<p>Come on Acha, Come on Acha!</p>
<p>Sure enough, Erga won a point. At this time, a red color appeared on his face. He clapped his hands as hard as he could, shaking the entire stadium. Because his life was in Erga's hands. However, there were also many people making "boo" sounds, because Erga was an underdog, and most of the gamblers didn't want him to win.</p>
<p>However, Erga finally lived up to expectations, and in the midst of "boo" and "clap," he won another point. At this time, Lukov cheered even more vigorously:</p>
<p>Come on Acha! Come on Acha!!</p>
<p>Lukov used all his strength in his hands and feet. If there were no wire fence blocking him, maybe he would rush into the stadium to help Erga.</p>
<p>Erga scored four points in a row. When Lukov saw this, his heart was about to jump out of his mouth. He clapped his hands desperately again. Although his hands were sore from clapping, he still didn't feel it. Come on Acha!!! One more!!!</p>
<p>He cheered at Erga like this. If he scored one more point, his life could be preserved.</p>
<p>At this time, Erga was playing against Lamos. Lukov had already been wary, because he knew that Erga could not beat Lamos.</p>
<p>His face was red and white for a while. Who knew that when Erga served the ball, he hit it into the first red line.</p>
<p>"Mala!" The referee raised his hand and shouted this. This "Mala" sound was like a bullet hitting his chest. Then Lukov's face changed from white to green, and from green to gray.</p>
<p>However, others only had one or two points, and Erga already had four points, so this game was not over yet. Erga still had a chance.</p>
<p>Now Lamos is playing against Shatelanggu. Who knew that Shatelanggu defeated four players in a row, so he also got four points. Then it was Erga's turn again. This is four points against four points, success or failure depends on this move, who knows who will win.</p>
<p>Lukov's life was in this instant. He didn't dare to look up again. He was about to faint in front of the wire fence.</p>
<p>In an instant, he suddenly heard a silver whistle and thunderous applause. He knew that something was not good. Looking at the score on the scoreboard, sure enough, Shatelanggu won. Erga only had four points, useless.</p>
<p>He stood there blankly, almost unable to support his body. The melodious radio music served as his elegy, sending him out the door.</p>
<p>The next morning, the local news in various newspapers published a message about an unidentified man throwing himself into the river. No family members were found. The Pushan Villa was ordered to provide a coffin to bury the body.</p>

<h3>Amateur Mailbox: Self-Study That Takes Into Account Writing and Reading</h3>
<p>Editor Sir;</p>
<p>Since leaving school and entering society, I have fortunately found a place to eat in a factory. Although the work is hard, compared to my unemployed friends, I am still lucky. The work here is twelve hours a day 丨丨 from six in the morning to six in the evening 丨丨 after work, I have to wash my own clothes and tidy up the dormitory. If you want to write a word after finishing your work, it is already late, and if you don't sleep, you won't be able to get up tomorrow! Therefore, there is no way to do anything in your spare time! Our "spare time" is basically non-existent!</p>
<p>However, the fear of knowledge is a feeling shared by every young person, especially our group of dropouts, who feel the need even more urgently. I really hope everyone will study, but few of my colleagues are in the same mood as me, because they are all burdened with families and wives. So, I am alone.</p>
<p>Although the factory has subscribed to two daily newspapers (Shen Bao and Xinwen Bao), you are not allowed to read them as much as you want during working hours: the environment is like this, making it really impossible to think. However, in any case, I am very interested in literature and art. In the supplements, I saw many moving and great works, which made me admire and ashamed. I always have the question, "We are all young people, why am I so useless?" I often sell and encourage myself like this, but how can one make progress by groping in the dark? Therefore, I turned my attention to the library and writing articles. Everyone knows that the library is the best place to increase knowledge. What about submitting articles? It can also arouse the interest in writing works. Therefore, I have two questions, and I am sorry to ask you for instructions. Of course, sir, you will definitely not have so much free time, but here I sincerely request you, in any case, give me a reply, the sooner or later the time does not matter. I want to ask, is it possible to submit articles to the supplement? Am I good enough? How should the manuscript paper be written? What is the procedure for submitting articles? Also, regarding the library, it is said that the circulating library attached to your newspaper requires a deposit of two yuan for borrowing books, and readers of Shen Bao only need one yuan. I wonder if I can be considered a reader of Shen Bao? Can I get preferential treatment? If so, what do I need to prove it? (Because the newspaper in the factory is subscribed to from newspaper vendors.) These are two very ridiculous questions, and I am troubling you heavily 丨 I wish you good health Wang Yuanxing respectfully</p>
<p>X X X X X</p>
<p>Editor's note: It is truly commendable that Mr. Wang can still not forget to seek to increase his knowledge after extremely busy work. The circulating library attached to this newspaper is purely for the purpose of serving society, and everything is free of charge. However, in order to ensure that the borrowed books are not lost for no reason, there is a regulation that each reader needs to pay a deposit. In the future, any reader who withdraws due to any reason will have the deposit returned in full. According to your situation, if you can show the receipt from the newspaper vendor, you can also receive preferential treatment according to the qualifications of a reader of this newspaper, and only pay one yuan. In addition, if you find it inconvenient to travel back and forth due to the distance, then as long as you come to the library in person once for the first time, you can follow the postal borrowing method in the future, and the postage for sending the books to you will also be borne by the library. As for the matter of submitting articles, it is also worth a try. The supplements of this newspaper and other newspapers mostly welcome submissions. The procedure for submitting articles is also very simple, just add new-style punctuation to the manuscript and send it directly to each newspaper, and write the words XX supplement on the envelope. Recently, the literary platform has been paying attention to the description of real life, and is not as strict on literary and artistic aspects as before. People with such rich lives, if they can use the spirit of creation to write articles, have a very promising future. However, each publication has its own stance, and you must understand it carefully. The same article, if it is not published in X publication, may be welcomed by other supplements at the same time. This point must be noted, otherwise the editor, with his iron face and impartiality, will inevitably give you a disappointment.</p>

<h3>Shanghai (20)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Lao San</p>
<p>31 Medical Expenses</p>
<p>A question came to my mind. I had been sick for two months. When I was seriously ill, I was unconscious and didn't know anything. Seeing a doctor and taking medicine, I thought that all the expenses would be a shocking amount. No one in the club could afford it. Like me, they couldn't dream of having stacks of banknotes in their pockets except for this body that could be exchanged for money. At this time, I saw my younger brother take out a silver coin. I wanted to know what was going on, or if I had harmed many friends. A sentence was surging in my throat, but my sister signaled to me with her eyes, and changed the direction of the conversation.</p>
<p>"Brother, I'll take you to a restaurant tonight." She stroked her brother's head and laughed at Sister Hui.</p>
<p>Sister Hui snatched the younger brother's hand and hugged him in her arms, saying:</p>
<p>"I'll take you to see a dance."</p>
<p>A burst of laughter swept away this doubt.</p>
<p>My body gradually recovered. I slowly browsed through some foreign manuscripts. Sister Hui came to the club every night. She said that she had become interested in literature and art, and brought short poems and short pieces of writing. Although they were not necessarily masterpieces, I was very happy that a city girl could suddenly change her usual state and devote herself to this kind of trick of literature and art. She also mentioned that a drama club had recently been organized in the school, and she seemed to regret that she had missed an opportunity to perform because she had not been to school for more than a month.</p>
<p>"Oh, you haven't been to school for more than a month. Is there anything going on at home?" I didn't take my eyes off my paper and pen. I was overly sensitive for a moment, thinking that something unexpected had happened to my uncle, so my tone of voice was very panicked.</p>
<p>Sister Min stumbled and said:</p>
<p>"When you were sick, she was by your bed every day. Didn't you see her?"</p>
<p>The friends in the living room all laughed, and I laughed along with them; however, the question of medical expenses floated in my memory again. I still haven't figured out who helped me with this big favor, and there is no suitable opportunity or suitable person to solve this mystery for me.</p>
<p>That night, I used the excuse of taking a walk to pull Gao Fei out, and mentioned this question intentionally or unintentionally.</p>
<p>"Gao Fei, I didn't expect to be so seriously ill."</p>
<p>"You take everything too seriously. I think you should change this old temper." He squinted his eyes and stretched his hands upwards, his words like William Heis's comedic posture "I'm afraid later..."</p>
<p>"Stop talking nonsense." I interrupted him "I don't know how much debt this medical expense has put me in?"</p>
