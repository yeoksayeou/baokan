<p>（倫敦）倫敦人士對於世界經濟大會延會後是否重行集會、頗多推測、自袁處來此之代表、多謂回國爲其政府所不許、而久留此邦、則大會前途氣象又殊黯淡云、今日主幹部請各委員會至遲於七月二十五日結束其工作、預料全體大會將於二十七日舉行宣佈延會三月、至於何時重開</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>爲全國鄕村建設恊進會進一解</h3>
<p>近年以來。國家多故工商凋殘。農村衰落。於是救濟工商與『復興農村』之聲。遂甚囂塵上。對於後者之鼓吹。尤爲盡力。在政府方面。則有『農村復興委員會』之召集。復由此委員會聘請『國内鄕村事業專家。』組織『全國鄕村建設恊進會』决議於本月十四十五十六三日。集會於山東鄒平縣鄕村建設研究院。（見七月十三日本報濟南通信）各專家溽署遠行共謀濟此奄奄埀斃之農村。嘉謀嘉猷必有足以蘇吾胼手胝足無可告訴之農民吾人於此。實不勝其希望與期待惟是茲事關係國家。至重且巨。而又頭緖纷繁。探源追本。恐非少數時日之集會所能包舉無遺。而農民疾若與農村衰落之　結所在。京未必盡爲諸專家所洞悉。不能不藉衆論之恊助。計自農村復興問題發生以來。本報已屢貢所見。以備採擇茲復趁此機。會略抒管見。以就敎於全國鄕村建設恊進會諸君之前。</p>
<p>行政院召集之復興農村委員會之重要議决案有三。一曰關於技術者。二曰關於經濟者。三曰關於組織者。夫技術問題。在農業上固極重要。然而在今日之中國欲對此破落不堪之農業加以新的技術。爲建設鄕村之具。必具有先决兩條件。</p>
<p>㈠政治問題在現今政治狀態之下。内有軍閥之混戰。官吏之誅求。土劣之魚肉。高利資本與地主之剝削。外有帝國主義經濟之侵略。不平等條約之壓迫。欲從事於農村之復興或鄉村之建設固皆知其難以着手。吾人今且不談根本改造政治僅就所謂鄉村自治問題而一商榷之。夫鄉村自治。已成爲時人之口頭禪。然而旣名自治。顧名思義。必鄉村能自治其事。而無待於他人之干涉與扶持。且所謂鄉村。究包含何種人羣。而此人羣與彼一人羣之數量如何。關係如何。應先爲詳盡之分析。然後乃能正名定分。着手於興利除害之</p>
<p>舉夫『鄉村』集合體也。居於斯者有地主。佃農。有自耕農。有農村工人。約略計之。富裕農民與地主實爲少數。多數則爲貧農。今日之鄉村自治。其自治事權將操之少數地主與豪紳之手乎。抑操之多數貧苦農民之手乎。或於兩者之間另有調和之道乎。查行政院之議决案。有『農村自治人才就地取才。但主持者須素孚衆望有一定之生活本據者。』所謂素孚衆望。所謂有一定生活本據。就中國農醉實際狀况言之。似非豪紳與大地主及富裕農民。均不克有此。果據此以限制選舉權與被選舉權。則大多數則大多數貧苦農民。皆將摒諸自治門牆之外。而所謂復興者。非整個農村或大多數農民之復興。乃農村之小部或少數人之復興矣。其建設成績。將來至多亦不過踐歐美國家農村之轍迹。此應請集會諸君深切注意者也</p>
<p>㈠經濟問題農民經濟窘迫。其原因旣由於帝國主義商品的壓迫。與苛捐雜稅之剝削。則今日急務首在解脫此等壓迫與剝削使農民不致有田不可耕。一方面又必須注意土地問題使農民人人有田可耕必如此然後『合作社『農民銀行』等乃可次第設施。不然。此等機關。亦不過爲農民多添幾許壓榨工具而已。至行政院復興農村委員會對於農民經濟决議第五項所</p>
<p>謂『各地已有典當關係農民生計。仍由各省盡力扶持。』此一條是否與農民確有利益。是否應設法改善。亦應請集會諸君深切注意者也。</p>

<p>（東京）中東路交涉已舉行五次、尚無頭緖、此蓋蘇俄欲謀交涉之遷延、其理由如下、㈠日本退出國聯後、於國際間孤立、其斡旋中東路讓渡交涉、即爲將來與蘇俄避免纷議、㈠蘇俄政府最近與中歐諸國訂立不可侵條約、與英美之關係亦有轉機、此時並不畏懼日本、故不出售中東路亦可、㈠交涉如果遷延、日本必極焦慮、僞國必以實力接收鐵路、此時列國必非難其不法行爲、此乃蘇俄方面之打算、至日本外務當局所抱見解㈠中東路讓渡交涉、先由蘇俄提議、日始出而斡旋、僞國並無强行買收之必要、且蘇俄於最近之將來、不得不抛棄此路、㈠僞國於北滿之治安維持上、有單獨管理中東路之權利、即以武力接收並非不法、㈠日本雖不希望與蘇俄纷爭亦不懼蘇俄等態度亦極强硬、（十五電通電）</p>

<h3>天廚號機試飛損壞</h3>
<p>入廠修理延期命名</p>
<p>航署兩機昨晨回杭</p>

<h3>試飛損壤</h3>
<p>該機運抵滬上、由德國容</p>
<p>試飛、經我方認爲滿意後、始行接受、前日航空著所派航校敎練官曁兩容克斯驅逐機、自杭州飛來、於上午十時抵虹橋機塲、即通知德廠試飛騐收、詎於試飛降落時、因駕駛者技衛平庸、降落太驟、致兩輪軸壓斷、機首旋轉針亦觸及地面而折斷、航空恊會秘書長林我將氏接電話報告後、立即馳往虹橋飛機塲視察、該機即運入航空工廠修理、因我方尚未騐收、一切修理責任、均由德廠負責、而命名典禮、乃因之下得不延期矣、</p>

<p>機翼及引擎等、均損壞頗甚、修理不易、聞天廚廠將請容克斯公司另換一新機、因此命名典禮、將爲之無期展延、按容克斯爲德國著名製造飛機廠、日前自柏林</p>
<h3>兩機回杭</h3>
<p>航空學校敎官曁航署所派兩驅逐機、因天廚號機命名典禮旣延期、無庸久留滬、即於昨晨八時二駕原機飛回杭州、</p>

<p>速率每小時八十五英里　　機桴修竣第即飛往厦門海軍製造飛機處長曾詒經、於上月十五日偕機師蒲里氏、駕自製江鳳號水上敎練機、由滬出發、作沿江長途飛行、抵岳州後、因機桴損壞、折回漢口裝建國輪、於前日抵滬、昨晨十時、招待報界、報告飛行經過、及沿海飛行計劃、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<h3>溯江西上</h3>
<p>曾處長報告沿江長途飛行經云、江　號飛機、于六月十五日早晨九時十二分出發、時天氣陰　、帶有細雨、但漸漸開　、于九時卅七分過高橋太陽　照、氣候漸熱、十時十四分、遙遙可以鳥瞰通州、十一時五分到達鎭江、繞飛城市數匝、降落於江面、本定添裝燃料、午飯後、卽飛往南京、不意發動機之起動機、旋轉不　、不克成行、就地修理完妥、于次早卽十六日九時一刻、前往首都、九時四十七分到達、卽檢騐機件、就寗海軍艦午膳畢、正當趨赴海軍部報到、而陳部長已駕臨寗海艦恭聆訓話之後、卽束裝就道、時下午一時卅八分、天氣雖晴、浪湧殊猛、水流湍急、機桴疾駛於水面、殊覺吃力、未幾離水環飛都市、有十餘分　之久、於一時五十分離京赴蕪湖、六時二十五分、到達該埠、未幾、天氣變動、波浪劇烈、似將有風雨之勢、故决緩行、是夜宿於建康魚　獵艇、次早卽十七日十時十分　蕪、十一時十八分抵安慶、在永康軍艦午膳、午後風勢不佳、浪波轉巨、候至五時四十二分、始離娄安慶、六時三十五分到潯、宿于永綏軍艦、是夜狂風暴雨、飛機通霄　於永綏舵後、受風浪之蕩漾、想機桴受傷、卽基於此矣、天亮、　雨拖往海關躉船後面、以避狂風、十九夕、風雨稍歇、卽行檢騐全機、飛機本身、　造堅固、毫無發生疵病、至飛行亦甚平穩、每小時只開一千七百五十旋轉數、其速率爲八十至八十五英里、若開足二千旋轉數、最高速率、總在百英里左右、</p>
<h3>機桴漏水</h3>
<p>惟發覺右桴之中堵、稍有積水、經抽乾之後、於二十晨九句　、飛往漢口、十時三十分到漢、落水　昄微有風浪、水流尤急、受其打擊、底板衝破、水入中堵、以致兩桴浮力不匀、若非設計、備有雙倍之浮力、全機必有　斜沉没之危、並卽將機吊上威勝軍艦、一面電滬派匠護送備用機桴、廿六早晨運到、趕卽裝換、廿七日早晨十一時四十分、飛往岳州、下午一時十五分到達、落於洞庭湖口時、水浪固大、而兩桴觸水又不平、吃力不均、機桴及桴柱、全座震動、若非鋼件接頭十分堅固、其損傷必不止於右桴之微漏、二十八晚送匠到岳、就水上臨時掩補於卅早六時半飛回漢口、再吊上咸勝軍艦、以便機桴外部加固修理、四日修竣、時天氣風勢又轉爲不利、六日早晨勉强成行、因費時已久、旣不克再作長沙沙市宜昌之行、亦不能久待天氣、故從速飛回上海、繼續浙閩厦之飛行、不料中途發覺機桴又生疪病、　航惟恐發生意外、無右補救、故折回漢口、詳爲檢騐、各部均無弱點、惟機桴不勝水流猛擊、恐難再供沿海之飛行、因此决計拆卸運滬、重整旗鼓、以作閩厦沿海之飛行、此行雖未能完成原計劃之飛行、若就製造經騐方面而言、則不能謂之虚行本人絕對不因之而往悲觀、</p>
<p>修竣面南飛</p>
<p>江鳳號水上敎練機、由漢招商建國輪裝運抵滬後、昨已將機桴拆下、由製造飛機處趕修、惟機身及各部毫無損攘、放置在製造飛機處棧房、至於第二次沿海長途飛行、决俟江鳳號機桴修理完竣、卽行試飛、泊停吳淞口外、實地試騐機桴能否受海浪之衝激、如堅固耐浪、卽作沿海飛行、但最快恐須在二星期之後、抵厦門後、卽將江鳳號機交厦門敎練　、作爲敎練之用、曾處長卽會同駕機蒲里氏、轉輪返滬、</p>

<p>糖業首請商會起而呼籲</p>
<p>應照專約第一五條辦理</p>
<p>上海市商會據本市糖業公會呈、爲本市碼頭捐及濬浦捐兩項捐率、商民負擔過重、有礙商業發展、特電呈外交部及市政府、請予糾正、茲分錄電呈如下、</p>
<h3>糧業原呈</h3>
<p>業因碼頭捐濬浦捐有妨業務、曾迭陳痛苦、懇請鈞會向各主徴機關、予以糾正、及要求减輕各在案、茲再將請求糾正與减　之理由、陳述如下、查碼頭捐　本市政府所主徴、而委託以江海關於收取正稅時帶徴之、民國二十年五月市府與江海關訂立專約、其第一條所開、爲按照民國二十年進口稅則内進口稅徴收百分之一、又第五條所開、爲嗣後每年所徴不得超過以前各年最高數目等語、是斯捐徴收之標準與限度、俱有明定、但近年江海關並不依此辦理、而以現行之稅率相徴取、上年糖之進口稅陡增一倍、　　捐遂亦加倍增收、旣央却第一條徴收之標準、更　反第五條所取之限度、似此與約不符、於此無據之非公浮收、是不得不請求市府、　向江海關迅予糾正、務照專約按二十年之進口稅率徴收之、以昭實在者也、至於濬浦費在民元前、曾有明文規定、年支關銀四十六萬兩、嗣後始由江海關帶徴百分之三、名爲濬浦捐、當時增之數、亦殊幾徴、近年關脫迭增、此項濬浦捐隨之增收、以二十年度江海關進口稅收入言之、爲七七·二一八·二四一·五五兩每兩金單位以現値國幣一·九○核之、其所徴之百分之三、激收至百分四百四十萬元之多、較之前所規定者幾及十倍、比闻濬浦局因收入豐裕、除擴充事業與增加關支外、而所積猶鉅、乃於去冬議决購置濬海輪機兩艘、價約五百萬元、備開濬鋼沙洋、足徴濬浦之費、實不　帶徴百分之三之多、夫開濬海洋、爲國家整個水利工程、與濬浦部份渺不相及、若以濬海之費、亦取之於一部份上海進口商、其爲不平孰甚、於此國家待遇商人、以平等爲原則、自應另行妥籌、方昭公允、且顧名思義、應以濬浦爲限、依照舊例規定年費、將現時百分之三之徴收額、急宜大僞减輕、否則業進口貨者、當蒙　落之苦、爰再痛陳一切、函懇鈞會代爲呼籲、以期救濟云云、</p>
<h3>電外部文</h3>
<p>南京外交部鈞鑒、查浚浦捐創始於辛丑條約、而改訂於民元間、當時與列國公使締結河港修築稅新約、爲設立浚浦局經費之用、就進口貨課以附捐充之、以二十年爲限、則至今早應廢除、卽謂該局尚未經收回改組之前、不能不維現狀、則照新約規定浚浦局、每年經費、以關平銀四十六萬兩爲度、是海關代其徴收、捐率亦有限制、查近年海關、業於帶徴浚浦捐、照進口稅率徴百分之三、計其一年收入、已超原額之上、嗣後雖不减輕、亦應不再加重、方符原案、現在海關新稅實行之後、濬浦捐内按百分之三徴收者、無形中隨之增加、殊與當時原約</p>
<p>其自爲風氣、擴張收入、旣累商民、尤乖國體、理合電請鈞部鑒核、迅賜轉咨糾正、飭令海關對於徴收浚浦捐减輕徴額、勿得因實行新稅之故、增加徴額、毋任迫切待命之至、上海市商會叩寒、</p>
<h3>呈市府文</h3>
<p>呈爲呈請事、（中略）查碼頭捐徴收標準、按二十年五月間市府與海關訂立專約第一每五各條規定、應照當時進口稅徴收百分之一、并嗣後不得超過以前各年最高數目、意義至爲明顯、海關處於奉行地位、擅將徴收捐率隨進口稅增加而增收、幾達百分之四、與原案實有不符、迭經屬會呈請糾案、此事關係商民負擔、痛苦固深、而鈞府處於主管地位、殊難坐視、任其孤行、應有切實糾正之必要、理含備文呈請、仰祈鈞府鑒核、俯賜查照原案、根據規約、轉函海關、將碼頭捐改正微收、藉符成案、而紓商困、實爲公便、謹呈上海市政府、</p>

<h3>葛文卿龔文江</h3>
<p>並不起訴、請求先予開釋、其餘、周執章王述樵洪耀斗牛安如四人、依照刑法二百八十四條、預謀殺人罪起訴、遂將拘捕各被告情形、先行陳述、並稱死者趙鐵橋家住吕班路一百六十三弄四號門牌、十九年七月二十四日上午九時、趙與其妻王氏及保鏢劉華、乘坐七三四七號汽車出外、先至招商局、劉華即下車、將車門開啓、趙乃下車、步登招商局石梯、即聞槍聲、</p>
<h3>趙即應聲倒地</h3>
<p>而劉華因華槍照尚未掉換、未能抵抗、而匪方同時又向劉開槍一響、中劉手中所執之公事包、幸未受傷、劉乃狂吹警笛、召捕到來、而兇手則已逃逸、乃將趙車送紅十字會救治、至晚十二時身死、嗣經市公安局緝獲王勤善夏紹恩一名、解由上海地方法辽院審理、結果如何、不得而知、今捕房所獲各犯中、除周執章牛安如書有供單外、餘均否認、而趙之家屬等不知何往、故不能到案、遂將供單二紙呈案、依刑訴法第十三條十九條之規定、同一案件、經</p>

<h3>被告隔别訊問</h3>
<p>先提周執章、詢以、捕房之供單内、言詞是否係爾所供、答係受刑迫所致、錢庭長以雖曰刑逼、然終須爾述出、方能紀錄、乃將供單内容宣示、略謂我（自稱）前在浙軍第四師第八旅任輸送隊隊長、洪耀斗則任軍法官、故相識、十九年六月來滬、與洪相遇、由洪約至法租界菜市路祥順里十三號、經洪之介紹與王亞樵（王述樵之兄亦即本案主犯）　認識、旋王辦安徽學會、三充會長、而由其弟王述樵任敎練、我與洪耀斗亦在内担任工作、其次王亞樵宴我於洪之家内、牛安如夏紹恩等均</p>

<h3>述樵舉手爲號</h3>
<p>即開槍、向趙轟擊、當時我開放一槍、事後由洪拿出洋六百元、我拿一百元云云、以上所述各點、是否爲爾在捕房所供、周答雖係我所供、但實出於不得已、並無此種事實等語、繼由西探長惠脫投稱、本案被告王述樵洪耀斗牛安如被捕後、均先後由周執章加以指認、並陪同捕房人員至出事地點表演當時情形、彼並謂出事後、即逃至福州路雇一黄包車至洪耀斗家云云、庭上繼提牛安如、一昧抵賴、對於在捕房所供</p>
<h3>各節完全推翻</h3>
<p>又得王述樵、亦不認所控、並稱王亞樵、雖係胞兄、然並不來往、彼之住處、亦不知悉、民二十年我在安徽學會任常務委員、彼則充顧問、但極少往來、至周執章則因向我借欵不遂、曾欲將我綁架、此次實被誣攀云云、洪耀斗供、我前在龐炳動部爲軍法處長、旋任方振武之參謀、及浙軍第四師八旅軍法官、趙被殺時、適方部解散、我正在北平居住、對於趙鐵橋被殺事、完且不知云云、錢庭長以本案尚須調查、乃諭本案俟定期再訊、</p>

<p>自由談智識過剩  虞明　　世界因爲生產過剩，所以鬧經濟恐慌。雖然同時有三千萬以上的工人挨餆餓，但是糧食過剩仍舊是『客觀現實』，否則美國不會賒借麥粉我們，我們也不會『豐收成災』。　　然而智識也會過剩的，智識過剩，恐慌就更大了。據說中國現行敎育在鄉間提倡愈甚，則農村之破產愈速。這大概是智識的豐收成災了。美國因爲棉花賤，所以在剷棉田了。中國却應當剷智識。這是西洋傳來的妙法。　　西洋人是能幹的。五六年前，德國就嚷着大學生太多了，一此政治家和敎育家大聲疾呼的勸告靑年不要進大學。現在德國是不但勸告，而且實行剷除智識了··例如放火燒燬一此書籍，呌作家把自已的文稿吃進肚子去，還有，就是把一羣羣的大學生關在營房裏做苦工，這呌做『解决失業問題』。中國不是也嚷着文法科的大學生過剩嗎？其實何止文法科。就是中學生也太多了。要用『嚴厲的』會考制度，像鐵掃帚似的丨刷，刷，刷，把大多數的智識靑年刷回『民間』去。　　智識過剩何以會鬧恐慌？中國不是百分之八九十的人還不識字嗎？然而智識過剩始終是『客觀現實』，而由此而來的恐慌也是『客觀現實』。智識太多了，不是心活，就是心軟。心活就會胡思亂想。心軟就不肯下辣手。結果，不是自已不鎭靜，就是妨害别人的鎭靜。於是災禍就來了。所以智識非剷除一可。　　然而單是剷除還是不夠的。必須予以適合實用之敎育，第一，是命理學丨要樂天知命，命雖然苦，但還是應當樂。第二，是識相學丨要『識相點』，知道點近代武器的厲害。至少，這兩種適合實用的學問是要趕快提倡的。提倡的方法很簡單··丨古代一個哲學家反駁唯心論，他說，你要是懷疑這碗麥飯的物質是否存在，那最好請你吃下去，看飽不飽。現在　如說罷，要呌人懂得電學，最好是使他觸電，看痛不痛··要呌人知道飛機等的效用，最好是在他頭上駕起飛機，擲下炸彈，看死不死······有了這樣的實用敎育，智識就不過剩了。讀書瑣記  小雪　　㈠超階級的了解是不存在的。這不僅在人物的行動與思想上可以看到，就是在對於自然現象的觀察上也是一樣。所謂技巧没有階級性，自然界的美没有階級性，這都是非常觀念的二元論。我可以用事實來證明。蘇聯的名導演普特符金在『時間的特寫』裏有如次的叙述··　　雨止了。走出屋子，我正要通過前面的庭院。這時候，一個漢子正在軍用他的鐮刀，我站定身體將他仔細地看了一下。　　這漢子的上身完全地不穿衣服，肩上的筋肉，每逢鐮刀上下的時候，就會照着上面的陽光，所以落下來的瞬間，就會反射出耀眼的光亮。我一步步的走近他的身邊。舉高的鐮刀，闖進帶着雨滴宾草叢裏面。于是，薙倒了的草兒，就很柔和地倒在地上。從那帶着光亮的弓形的草葉尖端，一顆顆的落下了晶瑩的玉露。　　他的鐮刀還在上下的閃動，我，依舊痴痴地凝視着他的活動。　　把勞働寫得如此的美，實在不是一個『觀察深刻』的問題，而是對勞働了解的問題。福羅倍爾能寫得如此深刻，但他祗能在女人的洋傘上發現這種奇蹟。屠格湼夫能這樣做，但他决不是在貴族子人，與行獵消遣之外，去獲得這此東西。就是名畫家的米勒罷，他也祗能從農家的『晚禱』中，去發現宗敎的虔敬的美，與『拾穗』等等的一般可以供給玩賞的姿態。嚴肅的，熱情的，偉大的，深刻的，站在勞働者自身的立塲，觀察得勞働的美和愛，以及無限的歡欣，這祗有作爲名導演如普特符金，也祗有深深的生活在勞働中的作家綫能體騐得。没有階級性，這完全是一種僞言。　　㈡在觀察上是如此，在感覺的描寫上也是一樣的。勞働者的作家，他描寫勞働者的感覺，是比其他階級的作家，更深入，更眞切的。這當然是由於生活的緣故，由於對勞働者了解的緣故。如丁玲在『母親』裏寫一個農民的感覺··　　雖說這此榖子並不是他的，而是他的主人，他稱着老爺的，但是誰能說這田地，這榖子不是他的呢？只有他愛牠，像對一個自已的親生子，那末朝夕不離，他耕種牠，他站在牠裏面，牠用溫柔的濕的泥水浸在他的脚上，他在萝裏還不忘記要牠受營養。他收穫了，挑到老爺的倉裏去，而老爺們並不愛牠。當牠變成了米，在大鍋中沸着時，噴出不可形容的香味，办有他才會在心中發笑；或是當牠又走運時，被主人賣去還債時，也只有他是何等的懊喪呵！　　這是一般作家所能寫出的農民的感覺嗎？即使是對勞働者同情的作家，也不能深入於農民這樣的感覺的底裏呵。所以，如果想如實的眞切的描寫勞働者，而不歪曲，不空想，首先，是非走入對勞働者生活的理解不可。友愛  唐弢　　希臘大哲學家亞理斯多德（Ａｒｉｓｔｏｔｅ）解釋友愛，說是『兩個肉體一個　魂』。友愛在古希臘民族裏所佔的地位，超過一切男女親屬的關係，不受任何束　；水一般的融洽，火一般的熱烈，犧牲個人責貴的所有而去成全朋友，在每個希臘人的腦裡都是一種義務。凡屬承認希臘文化的人們，終不得不神往於這種眞摯，純潔，悲壯，光明的友愛吧！　　友愛不論性别，也没有條件，而是一種發乎内心的需要。荷馬（Ｈｏｍｅｒ）的伊理亞德（Ｉｌｉａｄ），寫亞吉爾（Ａｃｈｉｌｌｅｓ）撇開主帥奪妻的深仇，而去替一個死友追兇手，悲憤眞摯，愛朋友，愛過於他自已了。英國的哀詩裏，雪萊（Ｓｈｅｌｌｅ　）的阿唐奈斯（Ａｄｏｎａｉｓ），丁尼生（Ｔｅｎｎｙｓｏｎ）的回憶（ＩｎＭｅｍｏｒｉｕｍ），都是血涙的傾瀉。雪萊是哀悼至友基茨（Ｋｅａｔｓ）的死，悲歌哭泣之餘，感到死者已和自然融成一體，隆隆的雷鳴，　　的鳥啼，一切有着自兢音樂的地方，那一個不是死者的聲音呢！他覺得他的朋友　有死，来過是從生的夢裏醒　來了。於是他　醒他的心不要　躇，催促自已要往前走，在微風的細語裏有着死友的呼聲，他願由死而結合的一切不要因生而分離。這種情緒終不能使我們不感動吧！丁尼生哀悼密友哈蘭（Ａ·Ｈ·Ｈａｌｌａｍ）的早逝，用了長時期的推敲，寫成悲壯凄烈的絕調，每一字都是涙，每一行都是熬情的流露。此外關於友愛的描寫，還有許多。也許因爲友愛不是悲壯便得繼綿，所以特别適宜於勇敢的武士和多感的文人吧！這此一往情深的舉動，只有非『禮義之邦』的洋鬼子才肯幹，在中國，除了下流社尚有拜把子结兄弟外，所謂『聖人』『儒者』的讀書種子，决不肯輕易嘗試。替朋友預備一張床，便呌『徐孺懸陳蕃之榻』；聽　了曲高山流水，不免又要『碎作牙之琴』；萬一薦一個朋友到甚麽地方，於是那此以管仲自比的人們，就得喊『　，我飽叔也』了。伊古以來，能有幾個捨命全交的人呢！　　晚近所謂文人，可更不得了！結上狐羣狗黨，管他朋友不朋友，無中生有，造謠詆毀，明槍暗箭，友道到了今日，也可謂大觸其霉頭了。　開這個愛字不要談吧！總是社會害人！  江直聲　　現在大家談起無聊的文人就想到了他們種種自吹自捧造謠賣友的醜臉譜。其實此種『醜臉譜』有牠演進的過程，很可以作爲社會現象來研究研究。　　例如三角乃至四角五角的懋愛小說罷，最初是因爲『五四』以後靑年們狂談懋愛，紅樓夢的封建式懋愛不大合他們的脾胃，於是眼明手快的人在熟讀了菊池寛的小說醺醺然陶醉之際，來一套改頭換面的偷書手段，作爲『創造』品，企圖迎合靑年人的嗜好。這時的動機雖不純正，可是那臉譜還不十分醜。　　靑年的懋愛狂原是『時代病』多角懋愛的小說最初何嘗不帶着指摘時代病的面具，但是旣然『銷行』以後，金錢的誘惑便掀掉民那面具，在『金錢渴』的意識下拚命粗製濫造發揮文字的手淫··於是多角懋愛作家變成多角懋愛小說的『制造商人。』這時就有了醜臉譜的第一階段。　　但此時的多角懋愛小說製造商還是手工業式的商人。雖則把東洋貨改頭換面來應市塲上的需要，可是改頭換面也得費工夫，他自已到底還動動手。不幸混亂的社會裏不乏色情狂者，他們要求愈多愈好的抵級趣味的刺激品。這可『害』了人了！人只有一雙手，一天只有二十四小時，那裏能夠製造出那麽多呢？然而社會總替人安排好『出路』的。社會上有的是剝削别人勞力代價的資本主義生產方式，聰明的懋愛小說製造者也就採取了這個制度。他用廉價收買了無名靑年的作品，用自已的名字（應該說是招牌）轉賣出去，坐收十倍的餘利。於是從製造商變成販賣商。利愈厚而臉譜則愈醜。　　不用說，這也是社會逼迫他這麽幹的。因爲書店裏的老板不歡迎無名靑年的出品呀。　　但是社會這東西複雜得很。一方面固然不乏色情狂的靑年　，一方面也儘有頭腦清醒的靑年；而且一個模型的手淫小說看多了也使色情狂者感到乏味。這時，即使是製造商而兼販賣商的一等巧手也有點窘了。不過社會總替他們安排好『出路』的，譬如賣身投靠。　　這就是醜臉譜的最後一階段，現今正在徐俆展開。而這，據說也總是社會害人，非人自誤！所以眞眞可恨者，是這害人墮落的社會制度！</p>

<p>糧食</p>
<h3>河下米一蹶不振</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日來源四十餘號、零躉兩胃尙可、卒以人心不堅、形勢轉淡、市况未免帶軟、如常帮蘇同帮南港等厚粳及杜洋尖價眨修數分至角許、靑角松江薄稻津帮雖仍動辦二千包、行情亦疲數分、變陰元以乏貨胃香尙見挻秀、</p>

<h3>期粉在急盪中</h3>
<p>洋麥好前市漲···廠抛湧後市低昨粉市上午開盤後、各月份均見堅昂之象、以洋麥報價、又漲七八九角至一元左右、故開價後、人心又呈良好、各月份買氣、遂異常挻健、外行投機、亦頻頻買進不過大廠方面、對於近遠期、亦逐步套賣、尤以茂新爲最多、致市氣堅挺之中、微呈弱象、迨至下午開盤、市氣又忽不振因廠家之抛賣、仍見湧旺、而現粉之售開、亦見平値、聞兵船塘沽羝貨、二元三角九分、砲台開二元三角六分、約計三萬包左右、故近遠期遂又　落、觀察後步、以實銷平常、恐無過漲之望也、結果七八月份反小二厘半、九月分好五厘、十月份不動、十一月份好五厘、十二月份不動、</p>
<h3>期麥後市由俏轉疲</h3>
<p>昨期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份一致呈昂騰之象、以洋麥報價、續好七八九角一元不等、而内地麥價、被行家及廠家、雙管齊下、有意濫抬、所以人心遂見良好、轉之前日、計漲三五七分左右不等、迨至下午開盤、初尙平定、後以粉市回跌、兼以報載國際之經濟問題、有擱淺之勢、則將來小麥之來華、又不可免、所以人心復平、至結果祇本月份較好一分、八九月份好二分、十十一月份好四分、十二月份好二分、現麥市面、中次仍平、高貨開價、似又好三五分、惟廠胃有限、恐過高又須停頓矣、開瑤灣麥三元八角半、寳應麥三元六角八分、次六角三分、六合麥三元六角二分、次五角七分、丹陽麥三元六角半、和州麥三元四角三分、南京麥三元三角八分、崇明麥三元四角七分、蓬萊麥三元四角七分、次三角六分計開三千一百包、</p>
<h3>漢口豆壓迫火車豆</h3>
<p>今年各地新豆年成豐稔、各路陳豆均有傾售之勢、近來漢口信陽州豆陸　運　約二萬之譜、因售價不符、故未售開、新貨　次第登塲、昨貨户妨忍痛　去六七千包、價扯四元八角、由廠家及車坊辦云、昨正陽關豆又被迫進至四元九角半矣、</p>

<h3>囚糧</h3>
<p>— 楊餘聲</p>
<p>有幾種人，國家應負責養他。兵士，安内攘外所攸賴，應得給他軍糧。災民，國家防禦不週，致甩災象，應得給他賑糧。囚犯，申詳公文未到，似難奪其生機，應得給他囚糧。</p>
<p>有幾種人，在兵士，災民，囚犯身上發財。軍官，尅扣軍糧。假兹善家，尅扣賑糧。獄官，尅扣囚糧，名目雖異，『蠖兒』則一。</p>
<p>據說，蘇俄在五年計劃中，對於監獄之設備和待遇，改良得異常考究。一般無聊朋友，故意觸犯輕微刑法，進去亨受囚糧。中國失業人數雖多，還没有無聊到這個地步。或許是中國監獄没有蘇俄的講究，而囚糧又常遭獄官尅扣，不敢輕易嘗试試的緣故。</p>
<p>中山先生嘗說；『中國人只有大貧和小貧···』此語很有耐人尋味的哲理。我們常看到做官的大都喜歡鬧·排塲愈大，負債愈深。一到債累深潭，就不得不營私舞弊，爲非作惡。監獄長官職雖小，總算是官，當然要些功架。洋房，汽車，·····都是應有的排塲。講究排塲要化錢，就是家况富有，而又不喜排塲，但爲子孫衣食計，亦得弄幾個錢。於是就着落在囚犯身上，尅扣或浮報囚糧。手段雖說悽慘，但念到目前排塲，或子孫將來，也就顧不得許多。</p>
<p>生不幸而爲人，更不幸而爲中國人，最不幸而爲中國監獄中的犯人，你想，一日三餐的囚糧，用『天秤』秤了份量發放，已慢多麽悽慘，而仍有人尅扣浮報。囚犯負其名，獄官得其實。監獄生活之黑暗，概可想見！</p>
<p>我認爲尅扣或浮報囚糧，是小到値不得注意的問題。但歷任監獄官都尅扣或浮報囚糧這個問題就嚴重啦。明知尅扣或浮報囚糧是犯法，未做獄官前，或許以此拆人的台。旣做獄官後，尅扣或浮報就比人加倍，凡屬官塲，軍官也，都是一例。所发中國根本是没有辦法！</p>
<h3>應時文章</h3>
<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>騒人墨客，『吟春』，『咏夏』，『愁秋』『哀冬』，一年四季，有寫不盡的『新詩』，咏不完的『佳句』，正像百貨公司的『大减價』，儘陰曆成爲『廢曆』，陽曆成爲『國曆』，總不用在春天舉行『政季大减價』。一時一景，往往會『左右逢源』，而且會『恰到好處』。</p>
<p>眞怪，這一手，如今給我們這些投搞家學會了．在冬天，你一篇『剛烈的北風』我一篇『純潔的白雪』．在春天，你一篇『嬌艷的桃花』，我一篇『溫柔的楊柳』。如今商店裏『夏季大减價』的標貼，已糊滿在櫉窗裏的大玻璃，弄堂裏已有『冷陰噁，賣冰呀』的聲浪，於是各報附張裏，便充浦了『蒼蠅』大作，『臭虱』文章。</p>
<p>在上海，蛙聲『閣閣』，絕對聽不見，蚊聲『嗡嗡』，因爲『洋涇浜』『城河浜』已</p>
<p>市外尋蚊，所以在上海，可說『嗡嗡已成絕響』。舍此之外，『黄狗拖舌頭』，『赤膊爬櫃檯』，究嫌不登大雅。『公園速寫』，『遊泳素描』，『屋頂乘凉』，『弄堂避暑』，『電風扇』，『冰其淋』，果然是『即景奇文』，可惜太普遍了，猶如在黄浦江裏看『外國兵艦』，横一條，堅一條，哦，又是一條。就是拉圾桶旁的蒼蠅，席子縫裏的臭虱，覺得也不過如此，不怎麽富谥詩意。</p>
<p>但是話又要說回來了。騒人墨客，一年四季做『即景詩』，今年四季詠遍了，明年再『即景』一遍，十年之後，仍是詠的『即景詩』。詠者不覺得乏味，讚者也不覺得煩膩。正如百貨公司每季『大减價』總是擠得水洩不通，賣者笑臉常開，買者爭先恐後。那麽　，我輩賣文者，用不平凡的筆，寫平凡得『十年如一日』的夏景，正『得其所哉』。</p>
<p>這正是『多談風月』的年頭兒大家盡景地談呀。</p>

<p>安樂窩生活專号二雯</p>
<h3>違反進化與創造的生活</h3>
<p>— 樸</p>
<p>在未繼繼續討論此次發刋這安樂窩生知專號時，願先向讀者說幾句關於我們編這專號所假定的四種系統的原則··（一）上海的富家日常生活（上期的内容）；（二）各地的富家行活（本期的内容）；（三）富家的婚喪喜慶；（四）富家的娱樂生活（將於以下兩期中發表，並歡迎投稿）。</p>
<p>過着安樂窩行活的人們，能否得到人生的眞快樂，上期漫談中曾略予解答，今日所要討論的乃是丨人類進化與創造互助的原則。　　一部人類的進化史，不外乎克服天然之痛苦，解除人爲的壓迫。根據一般人的心理分析，人生的目的，本可說不外乎安樂二字，但人類有史以來，總是不斷的受着天災人禍的交相壓迫，所以人類的歷史，也就是繼續的進化與創造，向着理想的安樂的前程奔赴。或者有人要問，這種所謂理想的安樂的世界，會不會永遠的爲人類的一種烏託邦呢？我們以爲這是可以拿事寳來證明的。我們現在每稱歐美各國爲先進國，究竟先進些什麽呢？簡言之，就是科學昌明，政治制度的進步，因此他們所受的天然的痛苦，人爲的壓迫，比我們中國人要一天少似一天。最進步的就是現在的蘇俄，他能從極專制的沙皇政體，一　而跳到超憲政的社會主義的理想制度，充分的利用科學，克服各種國内天然的人爲的困難。反顧我們中國的情形，則似乎是恰恰的背道而馳，水災旱災旣是有增無减，而入爲的壓迫（外患内亂）更有日益加重的趨勢。在這種雙重的痛苦環境中，而竟有許多人丨安樂窩生活的享受者，抱着得過且過的念頭，苟且偷安，醉生夢死的生存着，這種生活的结果與影響，小則阻礙進化與創造的過程，</p>
<p>大則足以促成亡國滅種的危險。</p>
<p>人類是立在進化的原則上而行存的，創造與互助的目的，乃是改進天災人禍的現狀。安樂窩生活的享受者，根本就失了創造的精神與互助的意識，所以此行活旣不是眞正快樂的生活，更是違反進化與創造的行活。</p>
<p>生活</p>
<h3>美女如荼僕從如雲</h3>
<p>— 屠恂如</p>
<p>富家在廣東</p>
<p>Ｘ城望族的清Ｘ園，總稱得上安樂窩了吧！我們廣州有一句俗語丨『西關不及大良龍』丨這句話的意思是說··整個西關的財富，也追不上大良龍姓一族的。廣州西關是頂富的地方，大多數的闊老都寓居那裏，把這樣的話來形容龍氏一族，不是駭人聽聞的嗎？龍氏族中，清Ｘ園一家是『出類拔萃』地闊綽，就是袁世凱的寵臣，洪憲時代的一等男爵，在貴州巡按使任上，剷了不少地皮的龍建章的家財也追不上他。他的富有，的確有點驚人，當然免不了會有人覬觎的，雖然『門又高，狗又大』，强盜不易侵犯他，他到底『財多膽寒』，有點相信不過地方政府，恐怕保護不周，那是不得了，而况順德的綠林朋友，在粤省也是數一數二的，因此就入了『紅毛』籍。</p>
<p>清Ｘ園的主人是頂聰明的，他在澳門建有不少的大厦，祇要有點『風聲』，他就從三十六着，揀了最上着的走，逃之大吉了。狡兎尚營三窟，况人乎！　　他永遠在溫柔鄉中陶醉地行活着，他擁有八九個小老婆，她們都是東堤，陳塘南或者石塘嘴紅極一時的『琵琶仔』（類乎滬上的長衫）。在『老舉寨』中是『艷旗高張』的，要把她們『帶埋街』（意即金屋藏嬌），非輕容易，總得花上整千整萬的銀子才行！</p>
<p>清Ｘ園横貫着ＸＸ里與Ｘ路，除了花園以外，還有四五間崇佛的屋字連衡着。在辛亥未反正之前，還有大個黑地金字的丨宫坊第，太史第丨横額掛在門　，眞是威風十足的。</p>
<p>清Ｘ園豢養的婢僕有好幾十，男的有賬房師爺，跟班（馬弁）門口公（看門者），大後生，小後生（男役），花匠，廚師，看更佬；女的呢，近身（梳傭）打雜（娘姨），煮飯，針　媽（兼擅剌綉的縫級者），俟年妹（未成年的娘姨），妹仔（婢），乾要（侍候小孩的），濕要（奶娘），應有盡有，色色俱全，眞是『堂上一呼堂下百應』，一家人都『養尊處優』地活着。出入都是乘轎的，以前有私人人的　呢大轎，高頭駿馬，現在，也許換</p>

<h3>封建領主的城堡</h3>
<p>— 談天</p>
<p>富家在四川</p>
<p>四川，謎樣的魔窟的四川也有牠的安樂窩，這些安樂窩是建築在血汗已盡的窮人身上，是建築在預徴糧賦至民國六十年上面，是建築在勒種鴉片迫食鴉片以　此抽捐上面，　建築　大小軍閥彼此互相搶奪殘表上　。總之，安樂窩的墻壁是由枯骨砌成，字樂窩的裝璜是由鮮血塗成，而他的主人就是一班軍閥和發財人。　　在重慶，你可以看到通遠門外曾家岩一帶的西式洋房，綿亘十餘里。從前的農村現在被劃圈爲軍長師長們的私邸，在四川　作公館。馬路是把山穿通了鑽過去，上坡下坡盤旋曲折的去將就偉人們的公館。據說在整個是石的山上修築十里馬路也要化去二百餘萬元，馬路上是不斷的有軍長師長的　　，每座公館門口是要停兩部車的，偌大的重慶除了偉人們的御用汽車外，没有一輛公用或商用的。某師長置有一　網球塲，據說是由美國技師建築，建築費約十餘萬元。每座公館都自備有網天塲，甚至足球塲，有音樂廳，有三千元薪水一月的外國音樂家在音樂廳裏敎偉人們的哥兒小姐太太唱歌，還有月薪幾千元的跳舞家敎她們跳舞，因此還有壯　宏大的跳舞廳。此外，尚有游泳池，花園，無線電臺，以及小的戲院和影戲塲，這種佈置是與歐洲中世紀封建領主的城堡差不多的。不怕重慶附近是饑民載道，是圍繞着齷齪腐爛的貧氏窟，但你只要往通遠門外馬路邊去閒游一次，從公館的高樓上所偷漏出的音樂，歌聲，是包夠你白相人享受的。因此，這條馬路也就成了一般人的公園，每到午後，總有成千成百的人去食偉人們的餘膾的。</p>
<p>雖然是交通不便的地方，在窮苦人還需用脚爬山，用肩挑物，然而偉人們却是來去無踪，飄忽若雲的。馬路網是佈滿在某一體系的軍人的防區内，馬路是專爲偉人們兜風用的，貧苦人是只能呼吸呼吸汽車駛過後秘留給他們的塵土和油氣。在窮鄙的山中有時還可聽見軋軋的飛機之聲，引得一般老百姓都和初民一樣的出來觀光。飛機上面正坐着軍長，師長或太太們，他們或是在指揮軍隊作内戰，或是在視察，或是在游歷。　　偉人們的亨樂可就屈指難數了。姨太太是每一個營長以上的軍官必備之物，如果你官到營長之職而無姨太太，一般同僚就必得駡你吝嗇太不漂亮了。姨太太越多越好，例如某軍長竟擁有數打之多，而且隨時殺戮槍斃，如果他不高興的時候。每一個軍事長官不怕小到營團長，他都要委任或自兼當地敎育機關的要職，因爲這樣他可藉上盡量選妃。如果民間有漂亮女子而敢私自藏匿者，她是要犯死罪的，例如成都某部的某圑長常率衛隊到女校或民家去『獵艷』就是明證。</p>
<p>有了大批姨太太便不得不有和她們在一起時的各種消遣和娱樂。跳，唱，淫樂是不用說了，還有是打牌和抽烟。伴着身旁的姨太太或者妓女，於是偉人們便大打其馬將或紙牌（四川所特有的），每次的勝負有多到十萬八萬的。偉人們的打馬將等於一天的三餐，是决不缺席的。四川廣出鴉片，大半的偉人和發財人都要抽牠，有每天能抽到四兩或八兩的。凡烟榻烟燈的裝置，帮忙打烟泡的僕人或女子，都一應俱全。如果客人</p>
<p>來没有頂好的鴉片　招待他，是要　罪客人的。</p>
<p>軍長們厭　破敗糟糕的農村肛厭　不美觀　一塌糊塗的城市。他們把城市裝點　　了，首先是透亮的馬路，其次是把高下長短，不重觀瞻的茅舍破屋。切成一列一列的街道，建築公園，再在公　附近建築他們的行營，酒樓，戲院。爲了　　提倡美術體育，而實際是爲了娱樂，爲了選紀，便不時有跳舞大會，游　大會和運動大會的召集，例如川北某軍長　年必得把他防區内的各女校弄來娱樂一次，即是證據。　　安樂窩的詳情是寫不完的，所能寫的也只是那些大的　顯而易見的，其實其是詳情要他們自已才知道。但是建築安樂窩的基礎是崩漬了，糜爛了，載不住了，因而安樂窩也就動搖起來，雖然　還是在拚命地掙扎着。</p>
<h3>土皇帝</h3>
<p>— 左匀</p>
<p>富家在安徽</p>
<p>我們如果站在城樓上向這城丨安徽ＸＸ縣城丨裏望去，一片灰黑色的房子，矮得像　魚一樣的伏遍了這城中的地面。只有一處是突出了這整個局面之外。它是那樣高大的，兩列七進房子的屋脊，顯示着高傲的神氣，好像對它的周園誇耀着；『你們誰也及不到我的偉大！』</p>
<p>提起了這房子的主人，要使這城裏的老百姓吃　的。因爲他的祖父在前清做過巡撫，他的父親在民國又是曾任某要隘的鎭守使，所以人家都說他家裏是代代顯宦。而傅到了這屋主人的手裏，因他不喜歡出外做官，寗願在這城裏做一個清閒的紳士，準備終老於家園，就有人恭維他達情入理的了不得的人物。可不知道他的紳士生涯，也是一樣的可以搜刮民財，在本邑的搜刮和在外省外縣的搜刮，其性質又有什麽不同呢？而且，當這號稱『民權』的時代，老百姓還是官吏的主人，所以他又可以常常掮着主人的招牌，做他欺詐勾當的掩護。這樣，他的生活是一直美滿的。　　他的妻是一位有舊道德的溫和女人，對於他丈夫的慾望，是抱定不干涉主義。所以他毫無忌憚的討了三房姨太太，把她們安置在這一所廣大的房子裏是毫不覺得擁擠的。雅片烟自然抽得很　了，他有時候以燒烟程度的高低，爲賞識姨太太的鑒别。因爲他抽烟的時候，必須要女人的陪伴和服侍，纔覺得滿足的。</p>
<p>他的時間除抽烟睡覺之外，就是進衙門去說話，或是陪地方上的官吏，過賭錢吃酒等類的消遣行活，這就是紳士階級的眞正任務。</p>
<p>廚司趙四，最愛聽『開飯哪！老爺不在家，衙門裏請吃飯去了』的報告，這樣他就不必担心思；因爲這紳士吃飯是最講究口味的，菜肴有一點不合意的時候，連盤子都要　下地去的。</p>
<p>這紳士除掉日常優美的生活以外，他還有兩種特别的嗜好··</p>
<p>第一　是出風　，也右以說是他搜刮　　之一　。　是　　　的公　　　善事業的發起，這紳士無論如何是要抓到領導權的。不然，他就要吹毛求疵的指責人家的不是，非達到讓渡過來交給他來領導的目的不可。自然，一般拍馬屁的朋友，就都來讚揚他熱心了，其實，絕不是這麽一回事。　　又一種就是培養身體。雖然抽雅片的人的精神，無論如何是萎靡不振的；可是他有許多補品培養着，夏天是童子雞做經常的夜點，冬天是溫火燉羊　和新鮮牛肉汁宵夜。其他如燕窩白蓮的清品，魚肝油紅補丸等的藥劑，更是儲備豐富，隨時可以服用。所以他的面色常是白嫩的，身體也常是肥壯的，雅片鬼的頭銜祇是吃烟的人所獨占的。</p>
<p>這紳士旣有財產，又有勢力，而身體又很壯健，所以他在這城裏的威風，是永遠攪擾着人們。但是一般可憐的人也就永遠抱着怨恨的心情忙碌着，有時還祇是抱怨自已的命運哩！</p>
<h3>劉姥姥進天堂</h3>
<p>— 靜思</p>
<p>富家在上海近郊</p>
<p>在一個秋高氣爽，菊花盛放的季節，我似乎很幸運的，踏進了一座見所未見，聞所未聞的人間的天堂。這是我生平二十六歲中獨一無二的一天，過那劉姥姥的生活。　　這天堂是在上海的近郊，有電車可以直達。從電車下來，遠望有許多汽車密密地排着；門前除站着兩個武裝的巡士外，還有幾位穿白制服的僕歐，正在代主人迎接從汽車中出來的貴客。大門雖也用鐵做成，但並不顯出怎樣高大，可是一進大門，眞是目迷五色了！</p>
<p>首先　引衆人目光的，是花園裏的一座噴水泉，周　約有三四方丈，是長方形的。四角放着四條像是白玉琢成的鯉魚，中間圓池的四方也站着四位裸體的仙女，和鯉魚的方向恰巧相對，所以從鯉魚嘴裏噴出來的水，恰巧射在仙女的隱處。『這主人眞會玩得很！』大家心中這樣想着。據說這池是以六千金元從美國運來，怪不得那白玉多麽的細緻，那雕刻多麽的精巧，而噴水的開關，卸水換水的裝置，又是多麽的機械化！</p>
<p>從噴水泉過去是一片剪修過的草地，園的南面是高而夫球塲，園的西面是玻璃花屋和紫　棚架，東一處，西一處的點綴着各色各樣的異國之花，丨當然劉姥姥是呼不出花的名字的，雖經博學的詳爲介紹之後，那名字也是怪難記的。不過今天是賞菊，所以那菊花我還識得，只是那菊花也好像生平從來没有寓目過，比劉姥姥家裏所種的又高又大，一盆裏像牡丹大小的總有八九十朶，都養得整整齊齊，清潔肥胖的。『大概也是外國種吧？』我問一個資格較老的同伴。『自然　！我們主人是非來路貨不辦的，等會兒去看室内的陳設，便可知道了！』</p>
<p>主人住的是一座三樓的新式洋房。樓下中間是大客廳，地板是光滑的小木片砌成，大概是作跳舞用的。一面是吸烟間，除发了隻長沙發外，大菜桌上還放着些金魚缸古董之類，這間要算全屋中陳設最簡單的一間了。一面是會客室，桌椅是紫檀紅木等做成，照例也有許多古玩。最令我回憶的，是各式電燈的技巧，有的是鳥立在架上，有的是狗伏在地上，有的是魚掛在鍊下，有是是獅子在滾繡球，發光的地方，就在鳥頭，狗脚，魚眼，繡球等部份。而各燈的配置也頗費匠心，比如鳥架是裝在壁間的，獅子繡天是掛在室中間的，狗是裝在門下的，而魚是懸在案頭的。可知同一燈光，在富人心目中，除了照視作用外，　還有藝術賞鑒的效用，這眞是所謂『行有餘力，則求藝術』，佩服！佩服！　　可惜得很，二樓以上都是小姐奶奶的閨房，除了知親外，外客未能輕易上去。惟據去過的人說，别的倒也想像得出，如銅牀，沙發，珠羅帪，白瓷抽水便桶，浴室等，在大旅館中也能見識到，惟有兩件卻『只應天上有，疑是人間無』了！一件是燈光可以隨時變色，　如熱大用黄色，冷天用紅色，右以帮助增减些溫度，月下用湖色，黑夜用白色，以便適合環境。又因爲每燈各有一開關，所以光色還可隨意調和，如開幾隻紅燈，再開幾隻燈，可變爲粉粉紅色，再開幾只綠燈，便成紫色，宛如晝家的渲染，變化無窮。一件是沙發等用具能藉機關而自動走人壁中，再以機關而令其自動走出。　想主人的用意，說他是要　些地位，倒不如說他要和椅子　開玩笑來得確切吧！呀！神秘的天堂！</p>
<p>這天堂的基地，約値價二十餘萬，房屋的造價爲三十萬，但室内的裝置，倒也需二十萬以上的呢！這筆巨大的欵子，是那裏來的？不是侷居草棚鴿籠裏的勞苦大衆的血汗嗎？</p>
<p>主人也和其他富翁一樣，有妻妾四人，郤祗生了兩位千金。幸而除了幾個老媽子丫頭幾　女性僕从外，還僱有大批的車夫，侍　，守門，保　，種花匠等，不致使陰氣太重。不過偌大的房子，主人的享用倒有限得狠，而且事實上出外的時間較多，郤使一般下人們坐享其福，他們眞是幸運兒轉世也！</p>
<h3>善良的老爺</h3>
<p>— 周念慈</p>
<p>富家在農村</p>
<p>高陞新從上海辦回來的無線電，却裝置在老爺的小書房裏。這本是四姨太太提議買的，照理應該放在她的房裏才對，可是這到底是鄉間少有的新玩意兒，放在常明客人來往的書室中，多少可以傲一下賓客；而且，老爺在太太面前也可以顯示自已並不台傅說的那樣專寵四姨。</p>
<p>老爺之娶妾，並不含有任何色慾的動機，而完全是出於眞摰的孝心，和保守古聖人『不孝有三，無後爲大』的遺訓</p>
<p>姨太太已娶到第四位了，四十五歲的老爺，却還養不出一個兒子來，並連女孩也没有一個，這點在老爺一榻横陳手燒烟泡的時候，對着幽黯职豆的燈光，不免常要怨四個小妾無能了！</p>
<p>據說老爺的命穩，所以能克守家業，每年靠田上的收成，坐擁妻妾，足夠溫飽，自認爲一個安分的良民，也頗以善人自居。</p>
<p>善人是喜歡做好事的，祇要鄉人們有抵押品時，他是很願意借錢給他們，以救貧民的危急。抵押品最歡迎的是田地，而對於利息却不很計較的。</p>
<p>老爺對於佃户，也很客氣，他對人是絕對否認有拘押或苛責佃户的行爲的；縱有，那也是管事的忠心，自已却禁止不來！</p>
<p>荒年，老爺肯借稻種給農民，却並</p>
<p>不限於自已的佃户，到秋雖要加倍歸還，可是救人之急，總是一種陰功積德。</p>
<p>遇到農民借欵到期不還時，善人認爲他家是眞窮，救人須徹底，於是隨即打聽他家有没有兒女。如有，善人是很可以行方便的，不妨帶家來養育，不過名義上呼喚書童侍婢罷了！</p>
<p>仁慈的老爺，有時也禁止姨太太們用烟杆去剌漂亮丫鬟的晳白面龐的。</p>
<p>小書房是老爺惟一的排遣所在，那兒，有幾書架的本版書，以備烟餘之暇，在精緻的烟榻上借綠幽微細的燈光，翻閱消遣。他收集書本的主要原因，却是在表白自已是個淵博的文人，隱者。　　他平生也没做過任何事業，他藝先人餘蔭，由少爺而老爺，固定的生長在這高郵縣的Ｘ村，然他的見聞却不貧乏，他對於公益也很熱心。自已的家裏，常年養育十幾個保衛團丁，這並不專爲自已將聲勢，催田租··而是爲的一村的大衆的利益呀！</p>
<p>炎熱的暑天到了，一所偉大的院子第三進的老爺的小書房裏，不時的傳出幽逸的雅樂聲和一陣陣濃厚的川土的烟香，以及女人們的笑聲···飄散，飄散到在列日下田畝間車水人們的耳鼻裏，於是大家便都平淡而又習慣地說··『我</p>
<p>們老爺眞好福氣啊！』</p>

<h3>『反對階級鬥爭』與『擁護勞資合作』</h3>
<p>— 毛維</p>
<p>上期看到盧勇爲君的『反對階級鬥爭擁護勞資合作』一文，我覺得盧君所提出的幾點都是値得討論的。現在我站在科學的立塲上，很客觀的來與盧君作學術上的探討。假使盧君有什麽異議，不妨再提出討論。</p>
<p>首先我們要說到階級，因爲明瞭了階級的是否存在，方可以决定媘級鬥爭的事實。假使中國眞的如盧君所說的一樣，没有階級，只有大貧小貧之分，那未階級鬥爭任人怎樣鼓吹，也决不會成爲事實。無奈客觀上與盧君所說的大爲相反，中國不但因受帝國主義的侵入，造成民民族資本主義的關係，使資產階級與勞動者成了同一比例的發展，且坐擁鉅貲的買辦軍閥和官僚亦所在皆是，而鄉村更有廣大的農民與豪紳地主階級對立。這些階級雖然有其本質的不同，但都不能否認其不是史實上的階級。旣有階級，當然免不了階級鬥爭的事實，歷來農民抗租抗捐與工人罷工的鬥爭，便是很好的例子，並非如盧君所說『階級鬥爭的起因，是資產階級與無產階級尖銳的衝突』，而是有了階級就有的事實，不過在目前更加趨於劇烈罷了。蓋目前不僅資產階級與勞動者的鬥爭成了尖銳的表現，所谓中間階級的小市民，小商人，自耕農，手工業者，知識份子，薪俸勞動者等也都被捲入了鬥爭的漩　。因爲這些中間階級分子，近年來同樣受到帝國主義，買辦，軍閥，官僚，豪紳，地主以及資產階級的壓迫與剝削，日益瀕於破產而墮入於勞動者的境地。所以他們也必然的要站在勞動羣衆方面，與勞動羣衆密切的聯合。才有出路。至於盧君以全國經濟的總破產歸罪於階級鬥爭，而忽略是由帝國主義的侵略所造成，像這樣的把因果倒置着，盧君未免太昧於社會的實際情形吧！</p>
<p>其次說到增加行產，盧君以爲只要能增加生產，就可以解决中國的民生問題。他没有看到中國在帝國主義的束縛之下，增加生產是不可能。就退一步說，帝國主義許你增加生產，也只有資本家才得到利益，决不能如盧君所望可以滿足多數人的需要。因爲資本主義的增加生產並非似社會主義的增加生產丨如蘇聯的五年計劃是按照整個社會的需要，以大衆的福利爲依歸而去很有秩序的增加生產丨而是爲了資本家自身的利潤，一般勞苦大衆依然要受很嚴厲的剝削。而且，假使對於大衆有利的生產没有利潤可圖，而生產一般的奢侈品，倒可以獲得多量的利潤，那末，無疑的，資本家必然要捨棄對於大衆有利的生產而盡量生產奢侈品。結果便會釀成社會上生產過剩與消費不足的現象，而使勞動者蒙受失業和其他種種莫大的痛苦，分配問題不僅没有解决，而且簡直是談不到。所以促進勞資合作與增加生產的结果，是只會犧牲勞苦大衆，使資本家大發其財，而决不會解决民生問題的。</p>
<p>最後，我們且看『國難』是否可以『共赴』。依上所述，階級鬥爭乃不可避免的事實，勞資合作與增加生產又成爲不可能，况且解决國難，首在實行反帝鬥爭，但反帝鬥爭的聯合戰線，早被民族資產階級出賣，聰明的民族資產階級早就看到反帝鬥爭已開展到另一新的時期，勞苦大衆的力量已經龐大，他們的要求也超過了民族資產階級的限度，足以妨害民族資產階級本身的利益，所以他們不但不敢參與，反而投降了帝國主義，帮助帝國主義阻碍反帝鬥爭的進行。這種例子，在現在固然是明顯得不必去說，就以反帝初期的五卅事件而論，也很可以看出。當五卅運動正熱烈時，上海租界的帝國主義停止了華商紗廠電力的供給，中國資本家便立刻向帝國主義求饒，露出那殘酷的面孔，帮助帝國主義進攻勞苦大衆，强迫停止對英對日的罷工。所以依照這種形勢看來，對於『國難』，無論你怎樣去謀『共赴』，一节剝削階級也决不會來和你『共赴』，他只有將你在他的高調之下供他去作獻媚帝國主義的犧牲品。『共赴』旣是勢不可能，那末，自然只有受帝國主義壓迫最深的勞苦大衆才是負担『反帝』這個重任的革命戰士呢！</p>

<h3>Continuing Mediation of the Chahar Situation</h3>
<p>Chahar Situation Shows Hope for Turnaround: Li Xin to Connect with Feng Regarding Yan's Opinions (Beiping) He Yingqin dispatched Chief of Staff Xiong Bin at 9:00 AM this morning to visit Song Zheyuan, inviting Song for a discussion at 10:00 AM. Song, accompanied by Xiong Bin, went to He's residence at Jurenyuan. Huang was also present. He Yingqin expressed that the Chahar issue was complex and should be resolved quickly. He hoped Song would continue mediating to achieve a peaceful resolution. Regarding Feng's association with the anti-Japanese military in eastern Hebei, he requested Feng return to Chahar as soon as possible so someone could take charge of local military and political affairs. Song returned to his residence and convened a meeting with Qin Dechun to discuss everything, planning to send Qin to visit Xu Yongchang to discuss peaceful steps. (Fifteenth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Li Qi left Beiping at midnight tonight. Liu Zhizhou also traveled in the same car to Zhangjiakou to meet with Feng, relaying Yan Xishan's opinions regarding the exchange of Hebei and Chahar. It is expected that Li and Liu will arrive in Zhangjiakou this afternoon to meet with Feng. (Fifteenth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xu Yongchang stated this morning that no one is unwilling to resolve the Chahar issue peacefully, and Yan Xishan also holds this view. However, regarding the rumors that Yan sent a telegram to him instructing him to conduct the Hebei transfer in Beiping with various parties, he has not received such a telegram. When various parties inquire, he has no way to respond. (Fifteenth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A peaceful resolution of the Chahar situation depends on Li Xin's return to Beiping to finalize the plan. According to individuals associated with the Shanxi side, Yan Xishan hopes for a peaceful resolution of the Chahar situation due to past historical relations with Feng Yuxiang. It would be best if Feng could control everything or leave Zhangjiakou and reside in a more distant location. (Next Five Days Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xu Yongchang stated that all parties advocate for a peaceful resolution of the Chahar situation. Feng Yuxiang shares this sentiment, as does the central government, which has also expressed that it will not use force. Since both sides are inclined towards a peaceful path, it will not be difficult for a third party to mediate and resolve all issues. (Fifteenth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Feng Yuxiang's secretary, Chen Houci, stated that Feng also hopes for a peaceful resolution of the Chahar situation and that no further complications should arise in this situation. Regarding the four measures previously proposed by Beiping: (1) End military operations; (2) Abolish the name of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army; (3) Song Zheyuan returns to Chahar; (4) Feng Yuxiang takes on the position of Forestry and Reclamation Commissioner. Feng believes that, regarding the first point, since Feng has only raised the anti-Japanese banner for two months, he has not yet achieved any results, and abruptly abolishing it would be inconsistent with his principles. Regarding the second and third points, he warmly welcomes Song's return to Chahar, and abolishing the name would not be a problem. Regarding the fourth point, Feng is not someone who seeks official positions under the guise of anti-Japanese sentiment, so whether he accepts the position is still unknown. (Fifteenth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Dai Chuanxian met with Zhang Zhijiang on the fifteenth. According to Zhang, during his meeting with Dai, the Chahar incident was briefly discussed. Feng's personality is very strong, and if he focuses on resisting Japan, something can be achieved. However, Feng is already surrounded by Communists and plans to organize a Soviet government in Chahar. If that happens, the danger will be great. When the situation in Rehe was urgent, if the central government had given Feng a title to resist Japan, perhaps the various incidents that have now occurred would not have happened.

<p>Japanese Puppet Troops</p>
<h3>Preparing a Counteroffensive on Dolon</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Japanese sources, the Kwantung Army has decided to invade Chahar again, using Li Xiuchen and Zhang Haipeng's puppet troops, totaling 20,000 men, as the vanguard to attack Dolon. The Kwantung Army has dispatched the Suzuki Brigade to supervise the battle. It will also order the Japanese Air Force stationed in Chengde to mobilize. A bloody battle in Chahar is imminent. (Fifteenth Hualian News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Japanese Military Attaché Shibayama</p>
<h3>Visit to He Yingqin</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding Feng Yuxiang's recapture of Dolon, the Japanese Embassy's military attaché, Shibayama, visited He Yingqin yesterday afternoon, stating that the Japanese side believes this violates the Tanggu Truce Agreement and requested our side to pay attention. (Fifteenth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A Reuters reporter visited the Beiping diplomatic authorities today regarding Tokyo's protest to Feng Yuxiang. According to reports, they were unaware of this matter. It is likely that Shibayama, a military attaché at the Japanese Embassy in Beiping, raised this protest. A Japanese diplomatic spokesman declared that he believed the fall of Dolon was only because Liu Guitang's troops, who had surrendered to Feng Yuxiang, were stationed there. There are currently no Japanese soldiers in Dolon. The reporter asked if the Tanggu Truce Agreement included Dolon within the zone that Chinese troops were not allowed to cross. The spokesman said it was. According to Japanese sources outside official circles here, Shibayama lodged a protest with two representatives of Feng Yuxiang stationed in Beiping yesterday. However, whether the Japanese army will take any action due to the Dolon incident is currently undecided. (Fifteenth Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Bao Gang's Troops</p>
<h3>Detach from Fang Zhenwu's Army</h3>
<p>Reorganized into a Brigade by Shanxi</p>
<p>(Beiping) Bao Gang's troops, numbering over 3,000 men with 2,000 rifles, 18 machine guns, and 18 mortars, are reportedly being reorganized into a brigade. (Fifteenth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Bao Gang has indeed severed relations with Fang Zhenwu and is currently stationed at Nuanquan, near Yuxian. Shanxi has already inspected them. (Fifteenth Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Li Fuying's Troops Relocate to Yanggao</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Li Fuying's troops have been ordered to relocate to Yanggao. The three brigades under his command, led by Liu Xiangjiu, Jia Xueming, and Li Jungong, began moving west from Chaigoubao on the 13th. Li led the eight departments of the military headquarters yesterday, leaving Chaigou to go to Yanggao, their new defense area. (Fifteenth Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Panchen Lama Returns to Bailin Temple</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Panchen Lama went to Beizi Temple to give lectures and to various leagues and banners to offer comfort. After completing his duties, he returned to Bailin Temple. (Fifteenth Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Qian Dajun Arrives in Beiping to Meet He Yingqin</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Qian Dajun came to Beiping from Baoding this morning to meet with He Yingqin to discuss important matters. He is scheduled to return to Baoding tonight. (Fifteenth)</p>
<h3>Li Jichun's Troops Reorganized to 6,000</h3>
<p>Results of Xue Lei's Negotiations with Li Jichun</p>
<p>Each Soldier Receives 20 Yuan Severance Pay</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Xue Lei, who is in charge of receiving the war zone, arrived in Tangshan and has had initial discussions with Li Jichun. The original number was 14,000, but 6,000 will be reorganized. Soldiers will receive 20 yuan severance pay, and officers will receive between 100 and 200 yuan. Xue and others will return to Tianjin to report and proceed according to the planned strategy. (Fifteenth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Due to Shi Yousan's continued activity in Qinhuangdao, it is difficult to predict whether the Beiping-Yushuguan through train service will resume on the 20th. The disposition of Shi's troops will be handled after Li Jichun's reorganization. (Fifteenth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A telegram from Tangshan states that Xue Lei arrived in Tangshan on the 14th. Li invited Xue to talk at 10 PM, and they dispersed at 3 AM on the 15th. They mainly discussed the titles of the officers in the reorganized army. The police force will be divided into four levels: general teams, down to large, medium, and small teams. Li plans to recommend Zheng as the team leader. Xi Duo arrived in Tangshan on the afternoon of the 15th to assist in the discussions. (Fifteenth Dispatch)</p>
<p>Qingdao Navy Reorganization</p>
<h3>Shen Honglie Completes Handover</h3>
<p>The Yongxiang and Other Three Warships Have Not Left Qingdao</p>
<p>(Beiping) The order for the Qingdao Navy reorganization has arrived. Shen Honglie is in the process of completing the handover. The new commander, Xie Gangzhe, has not yet assumed office. After the Qingdao Navy is reorganized, it will be under the control of the Beiping Military Council, and funds will be allocated as usual. Shen Honglie has not yet rescinded his resignation as Mayor of Qingdao. (Fifteenth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Qingdao fleet, consisting of the Yongxiang, Chuyu, and Haiou warships, is still in Qingdao today. Rumors that they are going to Wenzhou are inaccurate. (Fifteenth Dispatch)</p>
<p>The Haiqi and Three Other Warships</p>
<h3>Organized into the First Fleet</h3>
<p>Stationed Permanently in the Fujian-Guangdong Seas to Defend the Southwest</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Although the Guangdong government is determined to incorporate the Haiqi and three other surrendered warships, it lacks funds and supplies, so the matter has been delayed. It is rumored that the central government has proposed a two-step plan: to combine the Yixian and other three warships with the three escaped warships into the First Fleet, to be stationed permanently in the Fujian-Guangdong seas to defend the southwest. Chen Jitang reportedly told Jiang Xiyuan that he would act in accordance with the intentions of the central government. (Fifteenth Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

It drafted several measures and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for implementation.

(Fifteenth Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Director Wang Jingwei reported at the Palace Museum Board of Directors on the 15th, stating roughly that the reasons for the Executive Yuan convening the Board of Directors were as follows: (1) This time, the transport of antiquities to the south became a temporary and rushed phenomenon because there was no preparation in peacetime. After this experience, we should consider how to improve the preparation methods. (2) Our country only has one museum in Beiping, which is very inappropriate. If there are several branches, if one place encounters war, it can be moved to another place. Whether the government wants to establish branch museums and where they should be located should be discussed. (3) This time, the antiquities arrived in Shanghai safely, but there is concern that books may be damaged by insects. There are proposals to move them back to Beiping for display, or to change boxes in Shanghai, or to find another place to spread them out to dry. Each has its reasons and needs to be discussed and decided. In addition, Director Yi Peiji has applied for resignation. How to handle this also needs to be discussed and decided by everyone, because according to the organizational regulations, the president is elected by the Board of Directors, etc. (Fifteenth Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Economic Conference Nearing Its End</h3>
<p>The end of the month will see a formal announcement of the adjournment of the conference. The date for resuming the general assembly is difficult to determine. All committees should complete their work before the 25th. The Monetary Policy Committee has passed three resolutions.</p>
<p>(London) A typical quiet Saturday morning permeated the World Economic Conference in London today. No meetings were held. Of particular note was a letter from the Chairman of the Economic Committee, Dutch delegate Colijn, requesting all subcommittees to submit their final reports by July 21st in order to conclude. The letter also asked the committees of the Economic Committee to express their views on whether they could continue discussions afterward. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) Londoners are speculating considerably about whether the World Economic Conference will reconvene after its adjournment. Many delegates who came here from Yuan's camp say they are not allowed to return to their country by their government, and if they stay in this country for a long time, the prospects for the conference are very bleak. Today, the main leadership asked all committees to finish their work by July 25th at the latest. It is expected that the plenary session will be held on the 27th to announce a three-month postponement. As for when the meeting will reconvene, it is very uncertain. Many people advocate that all committees should return to Geneva with the Secretariat. If there is still no practical solution for currency stabilization in the autumn, representatives of the participating countries at the League of Nations General Assembly can hold a second meeting to approve the agreements on various commodities that the committees have already established. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>(London) Reliable sources have learned that the US delegation will oppose the economic conference setting a date for reconvening after the adjournment, believing that setting a date is tantamount to putting pressure on the United States to stabilize the gold standard by that date. (National Telegraph, 15th)</p>
<p>Monetary Policy Committee</p>
<h3>Establishes Three Resolutions</h3>
<p>(London) The Monetary Policy Committee of the World Economic Conference today established three resolutions to restore the international monetary standard. The first resolution concerned the establishment of an international gold standard, stating, "In order to establish an international gold standard, with the necessary mechanisms for its satisfactory operation, this committee believes that countries that do not currently have sufficient central banking systems must each establish independent central banks, granting them the necessary power and freedom to implement appropriate monetary and credit policies." The second resolution stated, "This committee wishes to reiterate the declaration issued by the previous conference regarding the close and interconnected cooperation between the central banks of various countries. The Bank for International Settlements should exercise its increasingly important functions, not only improving communication between countries but also serving as an instrument for joint action." The third resolution, after recording the recommendations made by Romania on behalf of several agricultural countries that central banks should adapt to their specific economic circumstances, expressed the committee's opinion that the solutions to be adopted should be determined largely by local conditions, and suggested that any country in need of advice should have its request given due consideration by international bodies with special qualifications to provide advice. The US representative did not say a word about the first two resolutions, which surprised everyone. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Progress in Gold Currency Situation</p>
<h3>Silver Agreement Encounters Setback</h3>
<p>(London) Today, the Bank of the Netherlands lowered its discount rate by half a percent to four percent. It is generally believed here that this is a sign that the Dutch currency has been able to fully restore its original strength after close cooperation between the central banks of the European gold standard countries. However, now that the situation of European gold standard currencies has improved, it is feared that the agreement negotiated by the eight major silver-producing and silver-holding countries to reduce silver production and the use of silver coinage will be delayed. This is because after adopting this agreement, all countries must stop destroying silver coins and reusing silver subsidiary coins. It is heard that several countries do not want to participate because silver coins are not popular with the people. Now that the situation of gold currencies is better, it is feared that the establishment of this agreement will be further delayed, even though the eight silver countries have agreed, but still on the condition that it is universally adopted worldwide. (National Telegraph, 14th)</p>
<p>(London) US representative Pittman told a Reuters reporter that the silver conference yesterday reached a deadlock because the Dutch representative held an opposing attitude. It is said that among the amendments to silver proposed by him, there were several points that the Dutch representative believed would hinder their silver payment matters. This is the reason for the Dutch representative's opposition. He believes that the necessary changes in the proposal can be made when he meets with the Dutch representative, Beyen, to discuss it. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<h3>London Exchange Market Stable</h3>
<p>(London) The foreign exchange market was very quiet today, with only ordinary commercial transactions. The US dollar fluctuated very little, remaining within the range of 4.78 to 4.77125. The closing price was 4.77125. The exchange rate of gold coins against the pound was also stable. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<h3>Moley Meets with the President</h3>
<p>Reports on the Situation at the London Conference</p>
<p>(Washington) After returning to the country, US Undersecretary of State Moley met with the President today to report on his experiences in London. After leaving the White House, he told people that he believes the economic conference has abandoned its efforts to temporarily stabilize currency prices, and this matter will no longer be discussed. As for whether there will be a possibility of establishing a permanent stabilization agreement in the future, Moley did not want to comment. According to people in the White House, there is nothing to report regarding the progress of designing a method to prevent fluctuations in the purchasing power of the gold standard dollar. Therefore, it is generally believed that the US President's plan is to prevent the rise and fall of commodity prices rather than to prevent the fluctuations in the purchasing power of the gold standard dollar.

<p>Tokyo Instructs Delegation</p>
<h3>Accepts Silver Proposal</h3>
<p>Opposes Restrictions on Sugar Production</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Foreign Minister Uchida today telegraphed the Japanese delegation attending the World Economic Conference, instructing them to accept the silver proposal. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry today telegraphed Ambassador Matsudaira in England, instructing him not to agree to the proposal to reduce sugar production. The reason is that Japan is not a sugar-exporting country, but only has a small surplus that is shipped to "Manchukuo". Therefore, Japan's sugar production cannot be regarded as an element that can disrupt sugar prices in the world market. (Reuters, 15th)</p>

<h3>Actions of the Japanese Delegation</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Although the Japanese Foreign Ministry has not received an official announcement regarding the suspension of the World Economic Conference, it had anticipated that this would happen. If Representative Ishii asks for instructions, he will be telegraphed to prepare to return home. According to the content of the telegram reported by the Tokyo News, "(1) If the conference can be reopened in mid-September, the delegation will remain in London temporarily; otherwise, they will prepare to return home. (2) Representative Ishii is instructed to visit major European countries to discuss friendly relations after withdrawing from the League of Nations and to promote new commercial treaties based on the principle of reciprocity to resolve the current domestic economic crisis."

<p>Lord Cecil Harshly Denounces</p>
<h3>Japan Violates International Faith</h3>
<p>War-Mongering Destroys World Peace</p>
<p>Sympathy for Japan is No Different from Aiding Tyranny</p>
<p>(London) The Federation of Organizations Supporting the League of Nations invited Yan Huiqing, the Chinese representative to the Economic Conference and Ambassador to Moscow, to lunch. Lord Cecil delivered a speech on the spot, addressing the Sino-Japanese dispute and severely criticizing the Tokyo government. Lord Cecil then said, "Regarding this matter, the only question we should ask is whether international disputes should be resolved by law or by war." Lord Cecil continued, "Since 1931, Japan has not only violated the law but has also been at war with the international community. In my view, if there were a crime of rebellion in international law, then Japan could not escape this crime. Some British people sympathize with the Japanese government, but these people are no different from helping those who violate the law. However, the law is the foundation of international evolution, and I deeply hope that these people can become aware of this." Yan Huiqing said in his speech that the Chinese government has always cited the three major treaties (the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the League of Nations Covenant) to maintain peace in the Sino-Japanese dispute. However, this cannot be said to mean that China has recognized the situation created by force, which is considered by the whole world to be a violation of the law. (Havas, 14th)</p>

<p>Japan's Attempt</p>
<h3>To Permanently Occupy Manchuria</h3>
<p>Decides to Fundamentally Reform the Military System</p>
<p>The Kwantung Army Will Be Expanded and Reorganized</p>
<p>(Tokyo) In order to solve the problem of the permanent stationing of troops in Manchuria, the Japanese Ministry of the Army has decided to fundamentally reform the military system. The purpose is to make the four eastern provinces the first line of its army's external defense, implement its special organization and education and training, guard against Chinese anti-Japanese sentiment, and carry out its continental policy. It is heard that the reform items in the Japanese Army's plan are as follows: (1) The number of standing divisions stationed in Manchuria.

From next year, the permanent stationing facilities of the Kwantung Army will be implemented. Army Minister Araki said on the 14th regarding this issue, "If no major changes occur in Manchuria in the future, the cost of the Manchurian Incident will be reduced to 150 million yuan next year and to 80 million yuan from the 11th year. At the same time, the policy of permanent stationing will be decided." (United Press, 15th)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>A Further Explanation for the National Rural Construction Promotion Association</h3>
<p>In recent years, the country has experienced many disasters, industry and commerce have declined, and rural areas have deteriorated. As a result, the voices of rescuing industry and commerce and "reviving rural areas" have become very loud. In particular, efforts have been made to promote the latter. On the government side, there has been the convening of the "Rural Reconstruction Committee". The committee then hired "domestic rural affairs experts" to organize the "National Rural Construction Promotion Association" and decided to meet at the Rural Construction Research Institute in Zouping County, Shandong Province, on the 14th, 15th, and 16th of this month. (See Jinan correspondence in this newspaper on July 13). The experts traveled from afar in the hot weather to jointly seek to rescue this dying rural area. We sincerely hope and expect that there will be good plans and good strategies to alleviate the suffering of our hard-working farmers who have no one to tell. However, this matter is of utmost importance to the country, and it is also very complex. Tracing the origin and source, it is feared that a few days of meetings will not be able to cover everything comprehensively, and the root causes of the farmers' suffering and the decline of the countryside may not be fully understood by the experts. The assistance of public opinion must be relied upon. Since the issue of rural reconstruction arose, this newspaper has repeatedly contributed its views for consideration. Now, taking this opportunity, I will briefly express my humble opinions for the instruction of the gentlemen of the National Rural Construction Promotion Association.</p>
<p>The important resolutions of the Rural Reconstruction Committee convened by the Executive Yuan include three points: one regarding technicians, two regarding economics, and three regarding organization. Technical issues are indeed extremely important in agriculture. However, in today's China, if we want to apply new technologies to this dilapidated agriculture as a means of rural construction, we must have two prerequisite conditions.</p>
<p>(1) Political issues. Under the current political situation, there is internal strife among warlords, extortion by officials, exploitation by local bullies, high-interest capital, and landlords, and external aggression by imperialist economies and oppression by unequal treaties. It is known to be difficult to engage in rural revitalization or rural construction. Today, let us not talk about fundamentally reforming politics, but only discuss the issue of so-called rural autonomy. Since it is called autonomy, in name and in fact, the villages must be able to govern their own affairs without waiting for interference and support from others. Moreover, what kind of people does the so-called village include? And how do the number and relationship of this group of people and that group of people relate to each other? A detailed analysis should first be made, and then the names can be rectified, and the division can be determined before starting to promote interests and eliminate harm. The "village" is a collective. Those who live there include landlords, tenant farmers, self-cultivating farmers, and rural workers. Roughly speaking, wealthy farmers and landlords are a minority, and the majority are poor farmers. Today's rural autonomy, will its autonomous powers be in the hands of a small number of landlords and gentry, or will it be in the hands of the majority of poor farmers? Or is there another way to reconcile the two? According to the Executive Yuan's resolution, "Rural autonomy talents should be selected locally, but those in charge must be well-respected and have a certain livelihood." The so-called well-respected and the so-called having a certain livelihood, judging from the actual situation of Chinese agriculture, it seems that neither the gentry, the large landlords, nor the wealthy farmers can meet these requirements. If this is used to restrict the right to elect and be elected, then the majority of poor farmers will be excluded from the door of autonomy. And what is called revitalization is not the revitalization of the entire rural area or the majority of farmers, but the revitalization of a small part or a small number of people in the rural area. In the future, the construction achievements will at most only follow the tracks of rural areas in European and American countries. This should be deeply noted by the gentlemen attending the meeting.</p>
<p>(2) Economic issues. The economic distress of farmers is due to the oppression of imperialist commodities and the exploitation of heavy taxes and levies. Therefore, the urgent task today is to get rid of these oppressions and exploitations so that farmers do not have fields that cannot be cultivated. On the one hand, we must also pay attention to the land issue so that every farmer has land to cultivate. Only in this way can "cooperatives" and "farmers' banks" be established one after another. Otherwise, these institutions are just a few more tools of exploitation for the farmers. As for the fifth item of the Executive Yuan's Rural Reconstruction Committee's resolution on farmers' economics, which is called "Local pawnshop relations are already related to farmers' livelihoods and should still be supported by the provinces." Whether this article is indeed beneficial to farmers and whether it should be improved should also be deeply noted by the gentlemen attending the meeting.</p>
<p>The Bells of the Pantheon in Rome Toll in Unison</p>
<h3>Four-Power Pact Signed</h3>
<p>The Ceremony Was Simple, Lasting Only a Few Minutes</p>
<p>England, France, and Germany Were Represented by Ministers Plenipotentiary</p>
<p>Effective for Ten Years After Ratification by the Contracting Parties</p>
<p>French Prime Minister Daladier's Trip to Rome Canceled</p>
<p>Rome, Today at Noon: The bells of the Pantheon in Rome rang in unison. Representatives from England, France, Germany, and Italy officially signed the Four-Power Pact in the Prime Minister's office in the Palazzo Venezia. The Italian representative was Prime Minister Mussolini, while the other three countries were represented by their ambassadors to Italy. The signing ceremony was extremely simple, lasting only a few minutes. After the signing, the dignitaries present chatted for more than ten minutes. At that time, French Ambassador Jouvenel forwarded a congratulatory telegram from Prime Minister Daladier to Prime Minister Mussolini. A large crowd of people stood in the square outside the Palazzo Venezia, undeterred by the scorching sun.</p>
<p>The signing of the Four-Power Pact is, in the opinion of each country, the most important event in diplomacy. At the same time, relations between Italy and France have also eased. For example, Italy and France have already shown a common view at the World Economic Conference, and both finance ministers have enthusiastically defended the stabilization of currency prices, jointly guaranteeing their currencies as countries that faithfully adhere to the gold standard. Now that the Four-Power Pact has been officially signed, people generally hope that France and Italy will consider the issues of Central Europe and disarmament in the same spirit of compromise. As for the slight differences in opinion between the two countries, it is hoped that talks can be held to completely dispel them. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the signing of the Four-Power Pact, rumors that Prime Minister Daladier would travel to Italy in the summer have ceased. Daladier will leave Paris today for recuperation in the countryside and will soon return to the capital. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the signing of the Four-Power Pact, people are paying attention to the issue of the successor to French Ambassador to Italy Jouvenel. Jouvenel's mission will expire on the 27th of this month. It is likely that when the French government appoints Jouvenel's successor, it will also appoint a new ambassador to Japan, as Ambassador to Japan Martell has been appointed as the French High Commissioner in the Mandate of Syria. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>Full Text of the Four-Power Pact</p>
<h3>Responsible for European Peace for Ten Years</h3>
<p>Preamble: "The governments of the four countries, knowing that each country is a permanent member of the League of Nations Administrative Council and the responsibilities borne by the signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty, and firmly believing that the atmosphere of world unrest cannot be eliminated unless each country consolidates its joint responsibilities, and is willing to faithfully fulfill the Locarno Treaty, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the declaration prohibiting the use of violence, and is willing to fully implement the League of Nations Covenant in accordance with the planned procedures without violating it, so that it can take full effect, and respects the rights of each country. Therefore, the following articles are agreed upon:</p>
<p>(1) The contracting parties shall consult each other on issues related to themselves and agree to strive for effective cooperation of all countries within the scope of the League of Nations to maintain peace. (2) The contracting parties shall propose any suggestions to give full effect to the various provisions of this treaty in various ways and procedures and agree to study them together, especially regarding Articles 10, 16, and 19 of the Covenant, which must be studied together, but the power to make decisions shall still be exercised by the competent authorities of international organizations. (3) The contracting parties shall strive to make the Disarmament Conference a success and agree that after the Disarmament Conference is closed, if there are still issues of particular relevance to the contracting parties that remain unresolved, the contracting parties shall study them again. (4) The contracting parties shall consult each other within the scope of the League of Nations on all economic issues related to each other's interests, especially the recovery of the European economy. (5) The validity period of this treaty is limited to ten years. After eight years of implementation, it will be extended indefinitely and continue to be effective unless a notice of termination is given. However, each contracting party may still give advance notice of termination two years in advance. (6) This treaty shall be written in the languages of the four countries, and the French text shall prevail in case of doubt. Each contracting party shall ratify it as soon as possible, and the instruments of ratification shall be deposited with the Italian government, which shall issue a certificate to each contracting party proving that the instruments of ratification have been delivered. This treaty shall take effect from the date on which the instruments of ratification of each contracting party have been delivered and shall be sent to the League of Nations for registration in accordance with the provisions of the League of Nations Covenant."

<p>Negotiations for the Sale of the CER</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia Adopts a Policy of Delay</h3>
<p>Non-Aggression Treaties Have Been Concluded One After Another, with No Worries About the West</p>
<p>Waiting for Japan and the Puppet Regime to Take Over by Force, Creating Illegal Acts</p>
<p>Tokyo Fifth Meeting Yields No Results</p>
<p>Suifenhe Joint Transport Negotiations Fail</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The sixth meeting on the CER is scheduled to be held next Wednesday (19th). The representatives of the puppet Manchukuo plan to refute the claims of the Russian representatives at the fifth meeting. Whether the price issue can be discussed is still doubtful. (Nippon Dempo, 15th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Five meetings have been held on the CER negotiations, but there is still no progress. This is because the Soviet Union wants to delay the negotiations. The reasons are as follows: (1) After Japan withdrew from the League of Nations, it was isolated internationally. Its mediation of the CER transfer negotiations is to avoid disputes with the Soviet Union in the future. (2) The Soviet government recently signed non-aggression treaties with Central European countries, and its relations with Britain and the United States have also turned around. At this time, it is not afraid of Japan, so it is okay not to sell the CER. (3) If the negotiations are delayed, Japan will be extremely anxious, and the puppet state will definitely take over the railway by force. At this time, the powers will definitely criticize its illegal behavior. This is the Soviet Union's plan. As for the views held by the Japanese Foreign Ministry: (1) The transfer negotiations of the CER were first proposed by the Soviet Union, and Japan only came forward to mediate. The puppet state has no need to forcibly buy it, and the Soviet Union will have to abandon this road in the near future. (2) The puppet state has the right to independently manage the CER for the maintenance of public order in northern Manchuria, so taking it over by force is not illegal. (3) Although Japan does not hope to have disputes with the Soviet Union, it is not afraid of the Soviet Union. The attitude is also extremely tough. (Jiji Press, 15th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the fifth meeting between Russia and Manchukuo on the purchase of the CER, it was held yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM at the official residence of the Japanese Vice Foreign Minister under the chairmanship of Ding Shiyuan. All representatives from Russia, Japan, and Manchukuo attended the meeting. Ambassador Yurenev refuted the statement of the puppet Manchukuo and strongly claimed that the Soviet Union had ownership of the CER and its affiliated businesses. Regarding the calculation of the price, he claimed that the construction cost should be used as the basis, and that the current economic value could only be a secondary consideration. Therefore, 250 million yuan was indispensable and he was unwilling to compromise in the slightest. Vice Minister Ohashi claimed that the current value should be used as the basis for calculation. As a result, they argued with each other and the meeting ended. The following statement was issued at 6:00 PM: Statement: In the fifth meeting, the proposals of both parties were continuously reviewed. The date for the next meeting will be decided by both parties through contact. (Jiji Press, 15th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Negotiations on the exchange of freight cars between the Ussuri Railway and the CER in Suifenhe seem to have failed. According to CER Director Li Shaogeng's statement to a certain foreign consul who mediated, the "Manchukuo" government could not agree to the exchange of vehicles because most of the vehicles were stopped at Suifenhe Station after the CER stopped joint transportation. Li also said that in order to seek a partial solution, the CER planned to transport the export goods belonging to foreigners free of charge from the CER to Harbin, and then they could be transferred to Dalian. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Since the joint transportation from Suifen Station was cut off, the export goods at Suifen Station of the CER and Grodekovo Station of the Ussuri Railway have been piled up like mountains since May 31. On July 11, foreign consuls visited CER Director Li Shaogeng and requested to open up the accumulated goods. Li's answer was sent from Vladivostok to this place and has been disclosed in the local newspapers today. This answer has revealed the true intention of the Japanese and "Manchu" authorities to cut off the joint transportation between the CER and the Ussuri Railway, which is to ensure that international cargo can be transported by the South Manchuria Railway and sent to the port of Dalian. Li told the foreign consuls stationed in Harbin that the "Manchukuo" government fundamentally refused to agree to the method of exchanging the freight cars accumulated at the above-mentioned two stations since the severance of joint transportation. Only in order to resolve the situation, it was suggested that the cargo be returned to Harbin so that it could be transported to Dalian by the South Manchuria Railway, and it was said that this cargo transportation could be free of charge. (TASS, 14th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) According to the Harbin Times, the CER Director has received an order from the Changchun Ministry of Communications that any Russian employees of the road who continue their destructive policies should be dismissed because the Soviet employees' attitude has caused losses to the CER and hindered the implementation of the new policies.

<h3>Russian Police Shoot at Puppet Police</h3>
<p>(Harbin) Two "Manchukuo" border police officers were shot at by five Russian police officers while patrolling the border near Suifenhe on Thursday afternoon, but only one person was slightly injured. The "Manchu" police team is currently investigating the matter. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<h3>White Russian Conspiracy Exposed</h3>
<p>(Moscow) This station received a report from Boli, revealing the truth about the ten White Russians detained by the Soviet authorities in the Far East on June 29. The report stated that, according to the confession of the detainees, they (including former Prince Ukhtomsky) seemed to have been arrested by Chinese anti-Japanese troops and extradited to the Soviet authorities by the Chinese troops. When the criminals were covering the Tongsang (transliteration) steamship from Harbin, they sailed out and went upstream along the Ussuri River. They were arrested on the ship. The Chinese soldiers ordered the ship to stop, arrested them, disarmed them, and extradited them to the Soviet authorities on the border. The weapons carried by the criminals were made by the Japanese and obtained from Harbin. They confessed that when they were sailing on the Tongsang ship, they disguised themselves as armed guards and planned to sneak into the Soviet territory to conduct reconnaissance and ambushes. The report also stated that the criminals also revealed in detail the organization of the conspiracy group, which was composed of General Kechismin, the leader of the White Russian fascist organization in Harbin. They also said that Mr. Ke's actions were ordered by a certain department of the Japanese army stationed in Manchuria. (TASS Telegram, 14th)</p>

It was resolved that ㈠ the Wei River, Anyang River, and Zhang River have excessive flow and insufficient downstream drainage. Local projects such as cutting bends, straightening, dredging, and reducing the river are costly and have limited benefits, so they should be delayed. ㈡ The fundamental plan is difficult to start due to insufficient data. The Water Conservancy Commission will conduct surveys and measurements and complete them in a short time, and then convene relevant provinces to discuss and implement them. ㈢ Local bend-cutting projects above Dezhou should be designed by the Shandong Construction Department and implemented after obtaining the consent of the Hebei Construction Department.

<h3>A Glimpse of the Depression in Changchun</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A returning visitor from Changchun said that Changchun has been extremely depressed recently. The Japanese restrictions on finance are very strict, and the economy is difficult. Many actors and actresses from Beiping and Tianjin went to Changchun to perform, but they all failed one after another and returned with losses. Recently, Changchun has set up restaurants such as Dongxinglou and Zhengyanglou, claiming to be branches of Beiping. Because there are many banner people from the Yaodu government, who used to be wealthy and extravagant, it is certain that singing houses and taverns will prosper. However, there are still few customers, resulting in unbearable losses. In addition, many banner people from Pingjin and other places went to Changchun to seek employment, but the appointment of personnel in the puppet government and various institutions is mostly for positions below eighty yuan, and there is freedom of appointment. Those above eighty yuan must be appointed by the Japanese. These banner people are scattered in the puppet capital everywhere. (Special Telegram, 15th)</p>

Gandhi has written to the Viceroy of India and asked the Viceroy to reconfirm his full powers so that he can negotiate a solution with the Viceroy. Gandhi's various non-violent resistance plans have been rejected by the Congress.</p>

Gandhi no longer considers the opinions of the leaders of the National Congress and threatens to reimplement the disobedience movement with some party members.

<h3>Competing to Welcome the Italian Air Squadron</h3>
<p>Chicago, Guomin, 14th - Today, the police here have cordoned off the open space on the lakeside with ropes to prepare for the arrival of the Italian Air Squadron. According to police officials, at least one million people are expected to watch the squadron land tomorrow. Previously, during the army exercises, there had never been a large squadron landing on the lake. Today, thousands of people tried to rent windows in high-rise buildings along the lake for a distant view. The Automobile Association also notified its members not to drive to the downtown area tomorrow. Thousands of unemployed youths are pre-occupying the open space tonight, hoping to sell better positions tomorrow. The Italian Air Squadron, led by Air Minister Balbo, is expected to arrive here tomorrow afternoon.</p>
<p>But the attention of the people of Chicago has never been so great as it is today.</p>

<h3>Files for Divorce from His Wife</h3>
<p>Citing Mental Abuse as the Reason</p>
<p>Min Dun, Guomin, 14th - Elliott Roosevelt, the second son of US President Roosevelt, filed for divorce in court here today on the grounds of mental abuse. The lawyer representing his wife expects to file a counterclaim on Monday. The President's wife flew from Washington to Los Angeles for her son and daughter-in-law.</p>
<p>The reason why Mr. Roosevelt chose this small town with less than two hundred people in Nevada to file the lawsuit is probably because the court in the capital, Reno, is known for being the easiest to grant divorces, and there are many bystanders at the trial, so he wants to avoid it.</p>
<p>Montreal, Guomin, 14th - When the Italian Air Squadron flew from Shediac and arrived here, there were 200,000 welcomers. The Canadian Prime Minister gave a speech on the spot, praising the great achievements of the Italian aviators, and praising the efficiency and discipline of fascist Italy under Mussolini's rule. Italian Air Minister General Balbo said in his reply that Italy has long cherished the ambition of forming a large air squadron to facilitate air traffic to distant countries. The purpose of this move is to improve aircraft and train skilled pilots. He also said that he hoped to fly to Chicago tomorrow and complete the 440-mile journey.</p>
<p>London, Guomin, 14th - The Italian Air Squadron's flight across the Atlantic to the United States further shows that Britain cannot remain safely isolated as it used to be. Every day, the news media takes this opportunity to urge the people to actively improve Britain's air equipment. It also said that French Air Minister Gode said that future wars can be won by bombing with a large number of aircraft. Seeing the flight of the Italian Air Squadron, this statement is truly credible. Since 1926, the French Air Force has been expanding day by day and can destroy London within 24 hours.</p>

In addition to criticizing the trade agreement regarding West Africa, the member also said that today there are still the Congo Basin Treaty, the Anglo-French Agreement, and the British part of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty, all of which are unsatisfactory. Second, China has recently increased the import tax on cotton goods by 50% to 100%. Its intention is to retaliate against Japan. However, China is obviously bound by the most-favored-nation treatment clause, so the predicament imposed on Japan also makes the British cotton goods industry suffer unbearable embarrassment. Mr. En then said that since the implementation of China's new tax, Britain's trade with Hong Kong has plummeted. The Colonial Secretary replied that he could not immediately express the Colonial Department's attitude towards the treaties, but he was fully prepared to take the most convenient method for the business community and the Ministry of Commerce to deal with the treaties. There are great difficulties in the Congo Basin Treaty. Then he talked about the discovery of gold mines in Kenya, saying that the new area is being mined. Then he talked about the resettlement of unemployed Arabs in Palestine, saying that the Palestinian government plans to borrow 200,000 British pounds to build public works to settle the Arabs. The loan will be formally guaranteed by the British government.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union's Fiscal Budget for This Year (Continued)</h3>
<p>(B) Expenditures: The expenditures in 1933 were roughly the same as in 1932. However, the business expenses of the main parts of the national economy, such as heavy industry and agriculture, were larger than before. The expenses for cultural and social undertakings, such as professors, teachers, and students to improve the price of living, also increased compared with previous years. The expenditure comparison between the two-year budgets is listed as follows:</p>
<p>× × × × ×</p>
<p>1932 1933</p>
<p>Item Amount (Millions) (Rubles) Percentage of Expenditure Amount (Millions) (Rubles) Percentage of Expenditure National Economic Development Fee 22618 75.7 23912 71.9 Cultural and Social Undertakings Fee 1684 5.6 2393 7.2 Administrative Defense Fee 1900 6.4 2264 6.8 Expenditure of National Debt 895 3.0 1330 4.0 Subsidy Local Fee 1640 5.5 1950 5.9 Other 1123 3.8 1392 4.2 Total 29850 100.0 33231 100.0</p>
<p>The first item in the right table, the national economic development fee, is less this year than last year. There are two reasons for the decrease in terms of economy and finance: ㈠ The total investment in 1933 remained at the level of 1932 (18 billion rubles); ㈡ The amount of the socialized public savings allocated to the government decreased. Among the national economic development fees, the expenditure on important economic departments is the largest. The special list is as follows (unit: million rubles):</p>
<p>Industry</p>
<p>Heavy Industry (including electricity business) 11379 47.6% Light Industry 815 3.5% Timber Industry 1089 4.5% Food Industry 748 3.1% Total 14051 58.7% Agriculture 2914 12.2% Transportation (all) 3321 13.9% Other National Economic Sectors (State-owned Commercial Local) (Economic Post and Telecommunications, etc.) 3626 15.2% Total 23912 100.0</p>
<p>Most of the above expenditures are used for new construction. The amount used for national economic development is 18 billion rubles, of which 12.2 billion is used for production expenses (that is, 75% of the total investment), which is taken from the government.</p>
<p>In the 1933 budget, the expenses for cultural and social undertakings were specially increased, with an increase of 700 million rubles compared with the previous year, that is, 35%. And what is mentioned here is limited to the construction of the two, and the expenses of high school and other schools. As for the expenses of primary schools and other public maintenance fees, they are not included. The budget for the latter is determined by local and social insurance organizations (mostly for medical care), and the expenses for national education, health, and social insurance are about 62</p>
<p>times.</p>
<p>The expenditure distribution of cultural and social undertakings is as follows (unit: million rubles):</p>
<p>㈠ National Education Central Local Social Insurance Total People's Enlightenment 108 278 88 2347 Higher Education 1758 407 111 2276 Science 287 17 11 315 Total 2153 2606 210 4965 ㈡ Health 136 734 80 2130 Social Insurance 104 83 1361 1548 Total 2393 3419 2581 8663</p>
<p>In 1933, there were approximately 50 million (49,713,000) students, of which 7,345,000 children entered kindergarten, 40% more than the previous year. 19,379,000 children aged 8 to 11 graduated from primary school.</p>
<p>The number of administrative and defense expenditures in the budget is small, about only one-sixteenth. As for the increase in salaries in 1933, it will be implemented from January 1st.</p>
<p>The characteristics of the expenditure side of the Soviet Union's fiscal budget are fully reflected in its emphasis on promoting the development of the Soviet economy, maximizing the improvement of the national cultural level, and increasing social welfare. What is most thought-provoking is the planned use of its savings for the construction of industry and agriculture to consolidate the economic foundation. (End)</p>
<p>The First Act of Large-Scale War in Sichuan Province</p>
<h3>From the 5th to the 8th</h3>
<p>Battle Lines Stretch Over a Thousand Miles</p>
<p>Both Sides Mobilize 300,000 Troops</p>
<p>Liu Wenhui Collapses</p>
<p>A Chongqing dispatch reports that after Liu Xiang strived to unify Sichuan, he united with the armies of Yang Sen, Deng Xihou, and Tian Songyao, convening the so-called Unity Conference in Deqing. At the conference, the various armies were assigned to suppress the Red bandits and pacify Sichuan, with 120,000 men assigned to suppress the Red bandits and 200,000 to unify Sichuan. The anti-Red bandit troops included the entire 29th Army of Tian Songyao, the entire 20th Army of Yang Sen, the entire 23rd Army of Liu Cunhou, and the 3rd Division of the 21st Army under Wang Lingji. It was decided to temporarily adopt a defensive posture, firmly holding the current defense lines to prevent the spread of the Red scourge. Regarding the troops pacifying Sichuan, in addition to the 21st Army of Liu Xiang, there were the entire 28th Army of Deng Xihou, the New 6th Division of Li Jiayu, and the two units of the 23rd Division under Luo Zezhou, dividing into three routes to attack the 24th Army. Liu Xiang appointed himself as the Commander-in-Chief of the Southern Route, Li Qixiang as the Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Route, and Deng Xihou as the Commander-in-Chief of the Western Route. Starting from the 5th of this month, all three routes were fully mobilized. Liu Xiang also telegraphed the central government, stating, "The flames of the Red bandits in northern Sichuan are spreading like wildfire. Cangxi and Guangyuan have successively reported their demise, causing tremors throughout Sichuan, fearing the disasters of Jiangxi, Hunan, Henan, and Hubei are imminent. Running around and calling for help, with urgent speed, Xiang has repeatedly received your telegrams, instructing to devise plans for suppressing the bandits, fulfilling my duties is of utmost importance and cannot be delayed. Unfortunately, the war between Liu and Deng has arisen at this time, with continuous warfare and turmoil throughout the region. I initially intended to quell internal strife first, and then gather the entire Sichuan military to jointly eliminate the bandit threat. However, the combatants continue to fight on their own, ignoring all orders, and my appeals are difficult to stop. Allowing the Red scourge to burn like fire, scorching the land daily. Who is responsible for this terrible state? It is deeply regrettable. Upon investigation, the Red bandits initially infiltrated Sichuan, only capturing Tongnan. Tian Songyao's army fought valiantly, and it was soon recovered. Only due to the outbreak of the war in western Sichuan, Tian's troops were diverted for defense, allowing the dying embers to reignite with fierce flames. Now, with internal strife ongoing and the bandit threat deepening, this is truly a critical moment of survival. Xiang bears responsibility for the aftermath but lacks the skill to restore order. I am mindful of the heavy trust placed upon me by the central government and the earnest expectations of the Sichuan people. I ponder anxiously day and night, exhausting every effort, comprehensively planning, but finding no other option than to exert my full strength, immediately dispatch troops, using a portion of the force to assist the armies of Tian, Yang, and Liu in suppressing the Red bandits, preventing further troubles, and sending another portion westward to halt the war between Liu and Deng, aiming to eliminate internal chaos in the shortest possible time to achieve the goal of jointly suppressing the bandits. This is the only way to turn danger into safety, alleviate the concerns of the west, and relieve the people of Sichuan from their dire straits," etc. Liu Xiang is indeed using unification as a pretext to dispatch troops.</p>
<p>On the 5th of this month, as Liu Xiang launched a three-pronged attack on the 24th Army, Liu Wenhui, upon hearing the news in the provincial capital, changed his original battle plan, appointing Xia Shouxun as the Commander-in-Chief of the First Route, leading the troops of Zhao Pei, Yu Zhongying, Zhang Zhifang, Li Yushu, and Liu Yuantang to defend Jiading. He appointed Lin Yungen as the Commander-in-Chief of the Second Route, with Chen Nengfen as his deputy, leading the troops of Lin Meipo, Gao Yucong, and Chen Nengfen to defend Renshou, and Chen Hongwen as the Commander-in-Chief of the Third Route, with Wang Zhu as his deputy, leading the brigades of Cheng Zimin, Yang Zongli, Jian Xixuan, and Fu Yuanxi to defend the area from Yunyang to Longquanyi. Leng Nanxun was appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Route, garrisoning Chengdu and serving as the general reserve force for the entire army. Zhang Qingping was appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the Fifth Route, leading the brigades of Xu Tingxiu and Wang Jingyu to defend the lines of Zhaojiadu, Sanhechang, and Chengdu-Xinjin. Deng He was appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the Sixth Route, with Tang Ying as his deputy, guarding the area from the Pi River, Guanxian to Banzhuyuan, including the entire division of Xiong Sijin, Shi Zezhou, Mou Suifang, and Wang Yuanhu. The battle line stretched from Jianwei in the south to Zijuguan in the east, from Xindu in the north to Guanxian in the west, spanning over a thousand miles. Both sides mobilized approximately over a hundred regiments, making it an unprecedented major battle. On the 5th, fierce battles erupted between the two sides, resulting in over three thousand casualties. On the 6th, the Chen Lanting division of the 21st Army occupied Jianwei, and the Guo Xun brigade of the Training Division advanced and occupied Bingyan. The troops of Li Jiayu and Luo Zezhou occupied Ziyang and Jianyang. On the 7th, the 21st Army continued to advance, with the Wang Zhiyi division capturing Renshou, and the combined forces of Li and Luo re-occupying Longquanyi. The 28th Army of Deng Xihou counterattacked from the Pi River, occupying Chongning, and launched a flanking attack on the 24th Army from Huaizhou. On the 8th, Liu Wenhui, seeing that the situation was hopeless, led his guards to leave the provincial capital in the morning for Meishan, also establishing the army headquarters in Meicheng. In the afternoon of the same day, Deng Xihou's troops entered Chengdu through the North Gate, while the troops of Li and Luo also entered the provincial capital through the East Gate, garrisoning the city. However, from the 5th to the 8th, the Allied forces suffered over 15,600 casualties, with the 21st Army accounting for the majority of 10,000. The casualties on the 24th Army's side were fewer, approximately around 10,000. The troops of Liu Wenhui are currently concentrating in Xinjin, Meishan, and Jiading, preparing to hold the Min River line. The majority of the 21st Army is advancing directly towards Jiamei from Renshou and Bingyan, with the Model Division, along with Deng Xihou, Li Qixiang, and Luo Zezhou, being responsible for clearing the upper reaches of the Min River on the left bank, attacking Xinjin and Shuangliu. Therefore, another major battle is imminent.</p>
<p>It is rumored that Liu Wenhui of the 24th Army knew early on that this battle would result in a significant loss, but he did not expect his nephew, Liu Xiang, to be so determined to completely resolve him. Currently, although his own strength is not weak, he is facing extreme difficulties in terms of military provisions. He convened a meeting of the division and brigade commanders of his army in the provincial capital, donating all his family wealth to be used as war expenses, intending to make a final stand. At the same time, he forcibly levied temporary military expenses in the counties within his defense area, totaling approximately five million yuan. Despite searching and seizing from all sides, the war expenses amounted to no less than fifty million yuan, intending to implement his monetary policy to divide the forces of the Allied army, but the results were completely ineffective. Moreover, the Chen Hongwen division under his command telegraphed all parties, returning to the establishment of the 28th Army under Deng Xihou. His 4th Division of Sichuan-Kang, Wang Yuanhu, is also planning to break away from the Liu family and return to Deng. It is recently heard that Liu Wenhui intends to hold the line along the Min River, waiting for an opportunity. If the Allied army besieges too urgently, he will lead the entire army to abandon his position in Sichuan and abandon the defense of Xikang, retreating to Yunnan and Guizhou provinces to develop. Long Yun of Yunnan has connections with Liu, and Long only has an actual strength of 30,000 men. Although Liu has been defeated in Sichuan, his strength still amounts to 80,000 to 90,000 men. If the entire army enters Yunnan to seek sustenance, Long Yun will inevitably have to yield. It is also heard that after Liu obtains Yunnan, realizing that Yunnan is impoverished and has a weak capacity to support troops, he will separately send a portion of his troops to Guizhou to seek sustenance, cooperating with Wang Jialie, hoping to build up his strength to make a comeback. Thus, Liu Wenhui's ambition will not cease due to his collapse. (July 13th)</p>
<h3>Inspection Notes of Jiangxi, Anhui, Hunan, and Hubei</h3>
<p>(1) From Shanghai to Nanchang, by Special Correspondent Ren An</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Nanchang, At the end of last month, I departed from Shanghai, traveling upstream by ship, riding the northern winds and breaking through thousands of miles of waves, a kind of magnificent rhythm that brought joy to my heart. This trip coincided with the period of the plum rains, a time of torrential river flooding. The degree of devastation was already visible everywhere east of Zhenjiang to the sea, but it gradually increased as we traveled westward. Upon arriving in Xiaguan, I immediately saw that the river water had already reached the shore, with countless workers rushing to reinforce the levees. A fishing village about two or three miles from Xiaguan had already been flooded, with only the roofs of about twenty or so houses visible. Such tragic scenes were frequently seen along the way. When the ship docked at Wuhu, many poor people sat in small basin-shaped boats, some even holding infants, with a pole in hand, suspending a cloth bag, raising it high to reach the various decks of the ship, begging passengers who leaned on the railings to throw copper coins. Their cries of pity and supplication echoed the shouts of the coolies on the lower deck carrying goods, "Hang yo, hang yo." The goods carried by the coolies were mostly foreign cloth and yarn, four people lifting, one person carrying, each package weighing four to five hundred pounds. The elderly or weak, unable to bear the weight, would have trembling legs, barely able to take a step, even causing their leg muscles to bulge like chicken intestines due to excessive exertion. As for their earnings, it is said that "when goods are loaded and unloaded at the docks, they are all contracted by labor gangs, and the wages of the hired coolies are only seven yuan per month, without food provided." The low wages in the interior are evident from this. Looking back at the passengers in the first and second-class cabins, idly passing the day, lying comfortably and eating delicacies, still complaining of inadequacy, many engaging in gambling, playing chess, and drinking through the night. There were even two or three opium addicts openly reclining on a couch, indulging in clouds of smoke. Although on the same ship, the scenes were so different, which is regrettable.</p>
<p>The riverside roads of Anqing and Jiujiang were navigable by boat, with rickshaws and pedestrians using telegraph poles as landmarks. In Jiujiang city, the water also reached knee-deep on First, Second, and Third Roads. People traveled back and forth by small boat. The traces of the great flood twenty years ago were still faintly visible on the planks of the shops, only a foot or so different from today. Residents and teahouses along the Longkai River were fishing from their second-floor windows, their expressions calm, which could be described as extremely amusing. Upon disembarking and entering the hotel, the smell of opium immediately assaulted the nostrils. It is said that raw opium transported from outside had paid a special tax and could pass without hindrance, but those smoking opium paste were occasionally caught and heavily fined.</p>
<p>From Jiujiang to Nanchang, one could take the Nanxun train, which only took five and a half hours to arrive. However, recently, due to rain and busy troop transportation, tickets were sometimes suspended. In the train and at the various stations along the way, there were many posters with slogans such as "Suppress the Communists and Save the People" and "Effectively Protect and Enlighten Communists Who Return." The atmosphere of suppressing the Communists gradually became more intense. The train passed through Yongxiu, where the floodwaters covered an area of about a thousand acres. Near the shore, the tips of grass could be seen above the water, forming straight lines like fields. This boundless expanse of water submerged an unknown amount of farmers' blood and sweat. There were also fields where the water had receded and seedlings were visible, but the rice shoots had rotted, and the farmers were pulling out the old and planting new, their faces full of sorrow, which was unbearable to witness.</p>
<p>After arriving in Nanchang, through the introduction of a certain gentleman, I met Mr. Xu, who had just returned from the front lines of the Communist suppression, and he spoke about the situation at the front, briefly saying, "The Communist bandits have been a scourge for six years. Now, following the principles of Chairman Chiang Kaishek, with 70% politics and 30% military action, and Chairman Xiong Shihui's approach of influencing and educating them, there is a gradual hope of clearing them out. Recently, the Communist Party has had what is called the anti-Luo Ming line. Those who implement the international line, although they have slogans such as 'Seize the central cities,' 'Disperse the strength of the White Army (referring to the National Army),' 'Establish a million-strong iron Red Army,' and 'Take the offensive, not the defensive,' are ultimately lacking in supplies and ammunition, and are merely putting on a show. However, their propaganda methods are quite effective. In addition to publishing dozens of periodicals such as 'Struggle,' 'Advance,' and 'Red China,' wherever they go, they also plaster anesthetizing slogans everywhere. When retreating, they use bamboo slips to write phrases such as 'Soldiers don't fight soldiers, the poor don't fight the poor,' which line the roads, intending to deceive our pursuing troops. Unfortunately, the general farmers are ignorant and unaware, and with enticement and threats, they end up joining the bandits, deeply poisoned by the anesthetic. There are even those who serve as accomplices for the tigers, spying on the military intelligence of the National Army and secretly revealing it to the bandits. I (Xu referring to himself) once asked an old farmer in a certain village in Lianhua, 'The bandit army has retreated far away,' and he replied that he didn't know. I asked again, 'Is the bandit army good?' and he still replied that he didn't know. The cunning of the farmers after being Reddened is such." He then heard that the two counties of Nanfeng and Nancheng had recently been recovered. Once the weather clears and cars can pass, he decided to go there first. (July 7th)</p>
<p>Hubei Provincial Government</p>
<h3>Scheduled to be Reorganized and Established</h3>
<p>Zhang Qun and Meng Guangpeng will come to Hubei from Jiangxi</p>
<p>A Hankou dispatch reports that since the Executive Yuan decided to reorganize the Hubei Provincial Government, former Chairman Xia Douyin immediately ordered the handover to be expedited, which is now complete. On the 14th, Xia convened the final meeting to discuss the closing matters. From that day on, the acceptance of official documents was suspended, and all documents that needed to be processed were to be issued by the 15th. The new provincial government was originally scheduled to be established on August 1st, but now, due to the urgent need for planning to suppress bandits and pacify the people, it was decided to advance the handover. Among the new provincial committee members, Li Fanyi, Cheng Qibao, Li Shucheng, Fan Xiji, Wu Guozhen, and Lu Zhu are all in the provincial capital. Jia Shiyi also returned to Hankou from Yichang on the 14th. Only Zhang Qun and Meng Guangpeng have not arrived. According to a telegram from Zhang, he and Meng boarded the Dehe Wheel on the 13th in Nanjing, heading west. On the afternoon of the 14th at 3 PM, they had already arrived in Jiujiang, and would transfer to Nanchang to meet with Chiang Kaishek, requesting instructions on the future governance of Hubei. They would not stay long in Jiangxi and would come to Hubei to take office. They are expected to arrive in Hankou on the 17th, and the provincial government can be established on the 21st. After Zhang arrives in Hubei, Xia Douyin will go to Nanchang to report everything to Chiang Kaishek in person, conveniently visit Lushan for a temporary rest, and then return to Hankou to take up his new position as the Chief Senior Advisor of the headquarters. After the provincial government is established, Li Shucheng will respond to Huang Fu's call to go to Peiping to assist in handling North China affairs, and will travel back and forth between Peiping and Hankou. The people of Hubei, after the flood and bandit disasters, are in dire straits, and their hopes for the new provincial government are extremely earnest and sincere. Zhang Qun recently published his views on governing Hubei in Nanjing, including (1) refreshing administrative facilities, (2) eliminating banditry throughout the province, and (3) restoring the rural economy. These are all urgent plans for the present. However, considering the current environment in Hubei, the most difficult issue is finance. Since the abolition of likin, followed by a major disaster, all tax revenues have been sharply reduced. Although the headquarters strictly ordered the implementation of austerity policies last year, revenues still fell far short of expenditures. The financial authorities, in addition to relying on the central government's subsidy of 200,000 yuan, had no choice but to borrow to make ends meet. From April of last year to March of this year, a total of 6,263,500 yuan was borrowed from various banks. From June of last year to April of this year, 349,900 yuan was borrowed from house rents. The old debts have not been repaid, and the new debts have reached more than 6,600,000 yuan. The government feels that it has exhausted all its resources, and the people are suffering and unable to bear it. Recently, Bao Cheng, who inspected and returned, said that there were many taxes and levies in the counties, and the people were unable to bear the burden. It can be seen that the top and bottom are in extreme difficulty. Therefore, reorganizing the finances is the central issue for future governance. Without a solution to the finances, all other administrative matters cannot be carried out. Whether the new provincial government can meet people's expectations will also be determined by this. (July 14th)</p>
<p>The Yellow River in Shandong Continues to Rise</p>
<p>Almost the same as last year's highest water level</p>
<p>A Jinan dispatch reports that the Yellow River has reached its peak flood season, and the water level has been rising continuously in recent days. At Luokou in the middle reaches, the water rose 2.9 centimeters on the 10th, continued to rise 4.4 centimeters the next day, and rose another 2.7 centimeters yesterday, reaching a water level of 29.6 meters. Dongzhuang in the upper reaches telegraphed that the water rose 4.6 centimeters on the 11th and another 1.8 centimeters on the 12th, reaching a water level of 58.04 meters, almost the same as last year's highest water level. The main current is surging, and all the dangerous works are under pressure at the same time. According to a report from the inspector Yang Zhenliang from Dongzhuang, the fifth breakwater of Li Shengcun's tenth breakwater only had a foot of water above it on the 12th, and the front and rear of the seventh breakwater collapsed, leveling with the water, making it difficult to protect. In a later urgent telegram at 12 o'clock that night, the main current of Li Gong directly hit the sixth and seventh breakwaters, and the Public Security Bureau urged 40 to 50 civilians to rush to protect them. By 11 PM, the top of the seventh breakwater had eroded more than two zhang in both front and back, no longer resembling a breakwater. Zhang Lianjia, director of the River Affairs Bureau, based on this, in addition to ordering the upper reaches to intensify protection and supervise construction, issued two telegrams today, unanimously urging the county heads along the river to quickly build sheds along the embankment, and urging the district and village chiefs to jointly defend the area with the section committees, unanimously urging all river section chiefs, section chiefs, and committee members to supervise the soldiers and civilians to patrol day and night, and defend according to the situation, ensuring safety. (July 14th)</p>
<p>Fan Qiwu</p>
<h3>Suddenly Resigns and Leaves Fujian</h3>
<p>The reason is that he was not understood by the military authorities</p>
<p>It is also said that it was Chen Mingshu who instructed him to resign</p>
<p>A Fuzhou dispatch reports that Fan Qiwu, the director of the Fujian Provincial Department of Finance, has been in office for half a year since the end of last year, and his reputation is mixed. Those who criticize him are mostly from the public, saying that he increased taxes and increased the burden on the people, and that his handling of affairs was too harsh, provoking resistance movements. Those who praise him are mostly government officials, saying that he managed finances well, and was able to allocate funds for various expenses on time, unlike his predecessors who were unclear about arrears. Fan himself believed that although Fujian's finances were chaotic, after his reorganization, they were gradually getting on track, and that after another six months, revenues and expenditures could be balanced, and old debts could also be repaid, and was quite optimistic. However, just as the budget案for the 22nd year of the Republic was established, and a plan to reorganize provincial taxes was just passed, Fan suddenly left Fujian on the morning of the 9th, taking a ship to Hong Kong. Beforehand, he only notified Lin Zhiyuan, a member of the Provincial Government, and Fan Hanjie, the chief of staff of the Pacification Commissioner's Office. Before leaving, he handed over the department's affairs to Zhu Gongzhun, the chief secretary, to act on his behalf, and submitted his resignation to Zhu, instructing him to forward it to the Provincial Government on the 10th (the 9th was a Sunday). The content was very brief, only stating that handling affairs was difficult, progress was difficult, he was deeply responsible, and requested that another capable person be appointed to take over, so that he could rest. It is heard that the Provincial Government has scheduled a committee meeting on the 12th to discuss the matter. Upon investigation, the reason for Fan's resignation this time, it is said that his handling of affairs during his tenure was often not understood by the military authorities, who telegraphed criticisms, saying that Fan's increase in taxes caused misunderstandings between the people and the government, hindering military operations. According to Fan's statement, he said that since taking office, he has not increased the burden on the people. The additional taxes collected were to eliminate the embezzlement of intermediaries. The anti-tax movements in various places were not the intention of the people, but were instigated by the intermediaries due to the loss of their rights as the government reorganized the tax system. In fairness, Fujian's finances have indeed improved after Fan's reorganization. However, the tax rates set were also too complicated, such as collecting business tax on chaff and house tax based on dimensions, often leading to major disturbances over minor issues, which is also undesirable. Another theory is that Fan's resignation was at the suggestion of Chen Mingshu, hence this determination. (July 11th)</p>
<p>Rural Experts from Various Places</p>
<h3>Attend the Zouping Rural Construction Advancement Conference</h3>
<p>Han Fuqu Telegraphed a Welcome</p>
<p>A Jinan dispatch reports that the National Rural Construction Advancement Association is scheduled to meet today at the Shandong Rural Construction Research Institute in Zouping County. Rural experts from the North and South, as well as scholars of vocational education and mass education, will gather together to discuss advancement methods.

A special telegram is sent to express welcome, the heat is excessive, hoping you take care of your health, Han Fuqu Koutou (bows respectfully) (July 14th)</p>
<h3>Anhui Province Actively Prevents Flooding</h3>
<p>Anqing dispatch reports that since the Yangtze River's water level has been rising daily, in Anqing, it is only three feet below the highest water level in the twentieth year of the Republic. The dikes along the river are simultaneously in alarm, with some having breached. Although the weather has cleared recently,</p>
<p>Therefore, recent observations are described below,</p>
<p>The alarm signals have been frequent along the river for the past ten days. (1) The Jingjiang and Mahua Dikes have many dangerous areas. The Department of Construction and the Yangtze River Flood Prevention Committee have discussed raising funds to meet urgent needs, and first sent technician Lu Shichun to help the county with protection. Then, Liu Yiyan, the director of the department, personally went to inspect, and went to Jiujiang to contact Zhou Xiangxian, the chairman of the Flood Prevention Committee, about everything. They brought materials from Xun and selectively deployed them on the dike. Liu immediately returned to the province and sent Pei Yixiang, the director of the Water Conservancy Engineering Office, to cooperate in handling the matter. However, the construction costs are still insufficient. The Flood Prevention Committee has agreed to allocate 10,000 yuan to add materials and increase protection. (2) Various dikes in Wangjiang County have repeatedly reported dangers, including Bao Xing Dyke, which was once breached but has been protected unharmed. It is still not out of danger. The Department of Construction has borrowed funds on its behalf and submitted a request to the provincial government to allocate subsidies to supplement materials, and sent personnel to organize a flood prevention section. (3) The Shengdong Guangji Dyke, ninety miles long, with half of the dike along the river and half along the river, is divided into four sections: Yuan, Heng, Li, and Zhen. The Yuan section is very strong. The Heng section has more than twenty miles that are sandy dikes and quite dangerous. The Li section has several places with seepage. The Zhen section has some stonework. The defense work is still considered diligent. (4) The Dongliu Guangfeng Dyke has the most dangerous east dike, followed by the north-facing river dike. Flood prevention is also being tightened, and the Department of Construction has borrowed 1,000 yuan on its behalf to purchase materials. (5) Among the various dikes along the Guichi River, the Datong Dyke is the most dangerous, currently,</p>
<p>One thousand yuan, and sent personnel to form a flood prevention section. (6) Tongling Guan Qu,</p>
<p>Is being protected by the dike residents, (7) The Poncet Island in Fanchang faces the current, which was almost breached a few days ago, but was rescued unharmed. The provincial government's Department of Construction allocated funds for rescue, and the Jiangxi-Jiangxi Engineering Bureau sent personnel to guide construction. (8) The Jiang堤in Wuwei County is more than 200 miles long, which is of great importance. The Provincial Department of Construction sent personnel to the dike to supervise. It is reported that the lower dam section is lower, and there are also dangerous signs in Xinban, Chuan Jia Longtan and other places, with several places of seepage, which are being repaired,</p>
<p>Dikes along the river that have been breached due to the inability to protect them in time include (1) Yufeng, Yongqing, and Fukang Dikes in Dongliu, (2) Puj济and Dongxing Dikes in Wangjiang, (3) Guangcheng Dyke in Huaining, (4) Lower Dacheng Dyke in Tongcheng, etc. Among them, the Lower Dacheng Dyke is of the greatest importance, and the Department of Construction has separately approved the Provincial Government to allocate funds for remedy. Various dikes within Anhui Province have been designated as the third flood prevention zone after deliberation at the Five-Province Flood Prevention Conference. The zone is divided into fifteen sections. The chief engineer of the zone has been recommended by the Department of Construction to be Lin Youlong, the director of the Jiangxi-Jiangxi Engineering Bureau, and the Provincial Government has appointed the county heads of twelve counties along the river as flood prevention commissioners, so that they can take over flood prevention with the engineers of each section. Each section only uses one engineer, technician, and clerk. The Department of Construction and the Jiangxi-Jiangxi Engineering Bureau have agreed to jointly dispatch personnel to form a group.

<p>Three Ships Fleeing to Guangdong</p>
<h3>Request for Enlistment Process</h3>
<p>Fang Nianzu Mediates and Conveys Mutual Opinions</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The three ships, Haiqi, Haichen, and Zhaohe, have been anchored off Chiwan in Guangdong since their arrival. Due to the lack of permission from the Guangdong authorities, they have not yet sailed into Humen. For six days, the captains of the three ships have been in contact with the Guangdong authorities via telegrams, and progress has been made. Consequently, the senior officers of the three ships left the ships on the evening of the 6th, taking a small boat to Hong Kong. They included acting commander of the Bohai Fleet and captain of the Haiqi, Jiang Xiyuan; captain of the Zhaohe, Ran Boqing; and captain of the Haichen, Qu Guan Yong. Simultaneously, Fang Nianzu, the mediator, was also in Guangdong, finalizing arrangements with the naval authorities to return to Hong Kong and report on the progress of the negotiations in Guangdong. Jiang, Fang, and the three captains, seeing the Southwest's willingness to accept them, took the Guangzhou-Kowloon express train from Hong Kong to Guangdong on the morning of the 7th to directly discuss the terms of service and various issues with the Guangdong naval authorities. They had given advance notice via long-distance telephone. On the same day, the First Group Headquarters dispatched an adjutant general, and the Naval Headquarters dispatched a captain. After exchanging pleasantries with the welcomers at the station, they successively took cars to the Southern Embankment Naval Headquarters to visit Naval Commander Zhang Zhiying. Zhang received them cordially at the headquarters, and the guests and hosts engaged in pleasant conversation. At noon, Zhang Zhiying hosted a banquet at the Naval Alumni Association, entertaining the three captains who had come from the north. Many members of the Guangdong naval community were present as guests. During the banquet, Haiqi captain Jiang Xiyuan reported on the process of the three Northeastern ships defecting and avoiding sinking, the recent state of the Northeastern fleet, and the sincerity of the three ships in coming south to Guangdong to join forces. He also stated that the three ships had come to Guangdong to assist in defending the maritime borders and were awaiting orders from the Guangdong authorities, but hoped that the Guangdong side would provide adequate financial support. After the banquet, Zhang Zhiying led the three captains to the Southwest Political Committee to meet with the various committee members, conveying his sincerity. The committee members inquired in detail about the division within the Northeastern Navy, and the three captains gave detailed reports. The committee members encouraged the three captains. After the three captains withdrew, they proceeded to Dongshan to pay respects to Chen Jitang. They were introduced by Zhang Zhiying. The three captains asked Chen for instructions on the enlistment procedures and consulted for about an hour. At 6 p.m., Chen Jitang hosted a banquet at Tuisi Garden to welcome the three captains, inviting military and political officials to accompany them. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves until about 8 p.m. (7th)</p>

<h3>Negotiations Regarding Chartered Car Solicitation of Passengers</h3>
<p>The Songjiang Sanyou Joint Human-Powered Vehicle Company and the Zhonghe Human-Powered Vehicle Company have made substantial donations to municipal construction and charitable causes. Recently, their business has suddenly declined, making it difficult for rickshaw pullers to make a living. After investigation, it was discovered that some people had purchased old chartered cars, entrusting various individuals to drive them and solicit passengers, which significantly affected the rickshaw pullers' livelihoods. They agreed to secretly investigate. On the 14th at 7 a.m. at the West Railway Station, they found Wang Asheng pulling a chartered car with a female passenger from Hangzhou. When they reached Malu Bridge, they pointed it out to the police on duty, who transferred it to the Public Security Bureau for handling. The two rickshaw companies also complied with the rickshaw pullers' request, presenting their difficulties to the authorities, hoping for a ban to be enacted.</p>

<h3>Police Arrest for Gambling Causes Disturbance</h3>
<p>The Entire Luoshe Town Goes on Strike</p>
<p>On the 20th of last month, the County Public Security Bureau dispatched inspector Ma Deshan with police officers to arrest gamblers at the Gonghe Teahouse in Luoshe Town, District 16. Villagers suddenly rioted, injuring police officer Gao Mingchong. Gao immediately went to the city to request the County Court to verify the injury and requested the arrest of the perpetrators. On the morning of the 14th, the director of the Public Security Bureau, Wu Desheng, learned that there was gambling activity in Luoshe Town. He then personally directed chief inspector Jin Shiqi, dispatched inspectors Lu Chenggong, Ma Deshan, patrol team leader Luo Zhi, police chief Chen Renlin, and more than twenty armed police officers and more than ten detectives, with twenty soldiers from the County Inspection Brigade providing support, to go to the countryside by boat to make arrests. After arriving at their destination, they deployed sentries on Beida Street. Then, under the command of Ma Deshan, the police began making arrests, detaining six men and two elderly women whose names were unknown on the road. The police then searched houses in the town, arbitrarily creating disturbances. Those searched included: (1) Liu Fusheng, the owner of a rice shop and recruitment agent for the Yixing opera troupe, Liu Jinchu, who was bedridden due to illness. Police officers went directly to the rear building to search. Liu, suspecting them to be bandits, was terrified and climbed onto the roof to escape, causing the roof tiles to be completely shattered. (2) Zhao Ajin, a tofu vendor, was beaten by the police. An elderly woman who tried to mediate was also slapped three times. (3) Cai Xitang, a villager, had five silver dollars and two copper dollars taken away by the police. (4) Fu Lin, a waiter at the Jufeng Restaurant, was also injured. (5) Shen Weiwen, the owner of the Gonghe Teahouse and a member of the merchant corps, had a five-shot pistol and a bag of dry rations stolen during the search. (6) Fang Chenshi, a female servant at Qin Yongfeng South Goods Store (53 years old), was pushed to the ground by the police in the chaos and fainted. She has been sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment. (7) Qian Rendi, a sixteen-year-old girl at the Taiwei Teahouse, was stabbed three times in the mouth with the butt of a gun by the police, causing her to vomit blood. Her clothes were stained red. The blood-stained clothes are currently stored at the District Chief Bao Songfu's office. (8) Hongyuan Teahouse was also searched. In total, the search lasted about an hour. Liu Bangyan, the captain of the 23rd detachment of the town's merchant corps, suspected that the police were bandits and immediately used the emergency signal to summon the corps members, who mobilized with weapons. At that time, villagers rang gongs to report the situation. The merchant corps and the police force nearly clashed. Seeing the situation, the police tied up the arrested villagers and ran back to the boat, firing two shots in the direction of Hezhong as they left. The merchant corps, seeing the disturbance, chased after them. The police then turned back and fired again. Subsequently, inspector Lu Chenggong and police chief Chen Renlin went to the district office to see the district chief. As District Chief Bao had gone to the city on official business, Lu sent police officers with a note to the second platoon of the eighth company of the third battalion of the fifth regiment of the military police stationed at the Luoshe Railway Station. Yang, the deputy platoon leader, led two military police officers to maintain order. However, the merchant corps continued to chase the police to Gaoqiaotou. The police then released the tied-up villagers and elderly women and went towards Qianqiao along the bank with their guns. However, because Fang Chenshi had fainted after being pushed, inspector Lu Chenggong, police chief Chen Renlin, detective Tang Yuting, and three boats were left in the town. The people were outraged and the entire town went on strike. The Second Sub-Division of the Fifth District immediately telegraphed the County Party Headquarters to send executive committee member Gui Hanchen to the countryside to investigate. Liu Jin and others compiled a list of losses and reported the situation to the Pu Party Committee. Bao Songfu, the district chief who was in the city on official business, also heard the news and went to the county to report to County Magistrate Yan. Yan immediately ordered him to go to the countryside to persuade the people, so as to prevent the turmoil from spreading. District Chief Bao arrived in the town at about 4 p.m. and, together with the Pu Party Committee, convened a meeting with the village chiefs and villagers at the merchant corps detachment headquarters to persuade them to resume business. A small number of shops on Shangtang Street resumed business at about 7 p.m. that night. At about 11 a.m. yesterday (the 15th), more than 30 representatives from the town, including Liu Bangyan, came to the city to petition the County Party Headquarters. Committee member Gui Hanchen received them. The representatives demanded protection for merchants and residents and strict punishment for the Public Security Bureau personnel who caused the trouble. Committee member Gui expressed his acceptance and sent staff member Gao Zugao to accompany them to the County Government to petition. County Magistrate Yan personally received them and promised to send personnel to the countryside in the afternoon to investigate the truth and then handle the matter. He also advised the representatives to go back and persuade the shops to resume business. The representatives were satisfied and left, returning to the town by car that night. At the same time, the County Public Security Bureau also submitted a report to the County Government for verification. Lu Chenggong and the other two also returned to the bureau yesterday to report. At 1 p.m. the County Government sent section member Zhou Shaoqi to the countryside to investigate and persuade the shops to resume business.</p>
<h3>Young Woman Commits Suicide After Being Insulted</h3>
<p>Zhou Fupei, a resident of No. 47 Dalou Lane in the city, is over forty years old. He has one son and two daughters. The son's name is Zhou Lin, and he works in the Yin Cao Department of the County Government. The eldest daughter's name is Qin Du, and she is nineteen years old. The youngest daughter is still an infant. At about 12 o'clock the night before last, Qin Du went out to get water with her neighbor Zhou Peiming. Unexpectedly, someone followed them, making frivolous advances and throwing bricks at them. Qin Du was unmoved. Sheng Jin then subjected Qin Du to sarcastic remarks. After being insulted, Qin Du felt ashamed and indignant. At about 1 a.m. yesterday (the 15th), she secretly took opium and committed suicide. However, she was discovered by her family, who immediately called Dr. Xu Shilin to administer an enema and provide emergency treatment. However, Qin Du remains unconscious and has not yet escaped danger.</p>

<h3>Bandit Chief Shang Dianyuan Executed</h3>
<p>Bandit chief Shang Dianyuan of Wuyi has been in custody for half a year. During the tenure of former County Magistrate Zhang, he sent letters threatening Secretary Wu, who was in charge of the bandit case. The robbery at Bagui Hall in the city was also committed by Shang's gang. As a result, former County Magistrate Zhang shelved the case. Cai Ziping, the Commissioner of the Second District and County Magistrate of Wuyi, took office and immediately paid attention to this case. After consulting with the public, it was generally agreed that Shang deserved to die. Together with other bandits, Qi Xigen and Tang Xihuan, he was sentenced to death. After submitting the case to the Provincial Government, an approval was received. County Magistrate Cai secretly ordered the Public Security Bureau police team to increase patrols in the city on the morning of the 14th. At 2 p.m., the three criminals were brought to the county to verify their identities and were tied up and taken to the Fengweidun execution ground, where they were shot separately.</p>

<h3>Preventing Abuses of the Petition Box</h3>
<p>The Seventh District Administrative Inspector Commissioner's Office has set up petition boxes in the five counties of Tong, Ru, Hai, Chong, and Qi to solicit public opinion. However, the petitions received in recent days have been filled with malicious accusations, causing disputes. Commissioner Ye has issued strict restrictions and requires that reports of banditry must be accompanied by solid evidence in order to prevent abuses.</p>
<h3>Drought in Northern Jiangsu Counties</h3>
<p>The counties of Tong and Ru in northern Jiangsu have been suffering from a prolonged drought. The farmland has been severely affected. All sluice gates along the Yangtze River in Tongyi have been opened to draw in the tide for irrigation and relief.</p>
<p>Changshu</p>
<h3>Labor-Management Dispute in Vermicelli Industry</h3>
<p>The vermicelli industry is quite developed in this county, resulting in a large number of workers. Recently, the workers in various factories have demanded wage increases from the employers, leading to unnecessary disputes between labor and management. Although the Party and government organs have tried their best to mediate, no resolution has been reached. Yesterday (the 14th), the Party and government organs convened another meeting of both sides. As a result, the employer representative, Shen Fengshan, proposed a renewed labor-management agreement to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, with an increase of four dimes per worker. After the agreement was signed, both parties were satisfied. However, after the meeting, the employer representatives reported the situation to the factories, who refused to acknowledge it. They claimed that wages could not be increased further at a time of business failure and unanimously opposed it. Chairman Shen Fengshan was unable to cope and resigned. The turmoil is intensifying, and it is unknown how it will end.</p>
<h3>Xingye Bank to Establish Branch in Changshu</h3>
<p>The banking sector here is extraordinarily developed. In addition to the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, which established branches in Changshu more than a decade ago, many major banks in Shanghai have recently established branches and private banks. Currently, there are the Jiangsu Bank, Farmers Bank, Industry Bank, Tongyi Bank, Jincheng Bank, and Dayou Bank. These banks have been developing savings, loans, and deposit businesses. The Shanghai Xingye Bank also intends to establish a branch in Changshu to expand its business. Staff from the Suzhou branch were sent to Changshu recently to negotiate and find a location. It is now known that the location has been found on County South Street. Wang Yimin, a former employee of the Dayou Bank, has been appointed as the deputy manager of the Changshu branch and has begun preparations. It is expected to be established next month.</p>

<h3>Young Man and Woman Attempt Suicide and Are Rescued</h3>
<p>Zhang Ruliang (also known as Zhang Zeyu), the third son of Zhang Yangyuan of Qingyang Fourth Street, worked in the Shunxing Hardware Store on Zhaofeng Road in Shanghai and is now unemployed. Last July, he met a Hangzhou woman, Yin Yingying, who is currently a junior high school student at Huiqun Girls' School. After they fell in love, the woman became pregnant for two months. Zhang had a wife, Liu, and a three-year-old daughter. Since his relationship with the woman, he divorced his former wife. On the 1st of this month, the man and woman arrived in Qing together from Shanghai and lived together at home for seven or eight days. His mother stubbornly refused to forgive them and scolded them day and night. Yin then conceived the idea of death. On the 11th, the two arrived in the city and stayed at Room 28 of the Dadong Hotel. The woman used her clothes and ornaments to pay for their expenses. On the 13th, they bought two bottles of sleeping pills and a small amount of opium and divided them equally. At about 8 a.m. yesterday (the 14th), the bookkeeper Wang Peiqing heard the moans of the man and woman and began to investigate. He called Dr. Sha Chunjia of Jiangyin Hospital for treatment, and they were saved. In the afternoon, Zhang's brother, Ruzhen, came to the city to take them back.</p>
<p>Huzhou</p>
<h3>Li Sanshou Illegally Detains Wine Boats</h3>
<p>Li Sanshou, a former patrol officer of the Zhejiang Western Liquor Bureau, acts lawlessly in the villages, causing widespread resentment. Recently, Lu Dere, who was appointed captain of the Third District Basic Team of Wu County, has become even more unscrupulous. Recently, under the pretense of patrol, he has illegally detained eight wine boats docked at Chenlou in Huchu, claiming that they were smuggling. He ordered the team to escort them to the bureau for reward. Wine merchants Sun Caijin and others believe that Li Sanshou's actions are akin to robbery and have filed a complaint with the county government, listing his usual misdeeds.</p>
<p>Letter</p>
<h3>Letter from the Second District Public Office of Baoying</h3>
<p>Having recently read a special dispatch from Qingjiangpu on the fourth in your esteemed newspaper, stating that swarms of locusts covered the sky from Baoying Jieshou to Huaian Jinghe, causing great damage to the autumn crops, we investigated and found that grasshoppers were discovered in the western grass in the Baoying Canal. The county government sent personnel to supervise the capture, and it has been cleared. The second district, which is north of Jieshou, did not have swarms of locusts covering the sky, nor was there any damage to the autumn crops. Fearing that the rumors are false, we hereby inform you and hope that you will make corrections. Baoying County Second District Public Office. July 10th.</p>

<p>Fang Zhenwu Telegram Requesting</p>
<h3>Relief for Dolun War Zone Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>Central Committee Member Fang Zhenwu telegraphed the entire country on the 12th, describing the tragic state of the disaster victims and wounded soldiers in Dolun, requesting immediate relief. The original telegram reads: Various provincial, municipal, and county legal entities, mass organizations, and newspapers, greetings. Our troops, Ji, Deng, Li, and others, launched a general attack on Dolun in the morning. The Japanese and puppet troops resisted stubbornly, first with aircraft bombing, then with tank assaults. Our troops fought bravely, engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat. At dusk, the enemy retreated into the city, and we besieged them all night. The enemy's strength was exhausted, and they retreated eastward. In the morning, our troops completely occupied Dolun, killing many enemies and seizing weapons and horses. Many officers and soldiers, from regiment commanders downwards, were wounded. We are currently pursuing them. Dolun has been in enemy hands for a long time. Thanks to the officers and soldiers who risked their lives and fought desperately, the wounded and dead are everywhere, with broken bones and open chests. The dead have no one to bury them, and the wounded have no medicine to treat them. The war zone disaster victims are living in ruined walls and collapsed homes, with nine out of ten houses empty. The elderly, the weak, women, and children are crying for food, with nowhere to go. It is a heartbreaking sight, in urgent need of rescue. We hope that all the people of our country will have compassion and provide immediate relief. I, Fang Zhenwu.</p>
<p>Li Liejun Telegram Requesting the Central Government to</p>
<h3>Grant Feng Real Power to Jointly Support the Precarious Situation</h3>
<p>Again Offering Unwelcome Advice</p>
<p>Daring to Invite a Humble Ear</p>
<p>Guidelines. Original telegram: Urgent, Nanjing National Government, Central Party Headquarters, Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, Judicial Yuan, Supervisory Yuan, Examination Yuan, Military Committee, greetings. Committee Member Feng Yuxiang raised the flag in Zhangjiakou, with the aim of recovering lost territory and avenging national humiliation. I, Liejun, have secretly telegraphed with Committee Members Wang, Zhu, Fu, and Deng, requesting that he be given great power to take on great responsibilities. These are just simple words, offered for your consideration. Now, Yuxiang has issued a proclamation to recover eastern Chahar and has reported the capture of Dolun after a bloody battle. The news of the victory has arrived in the capital, and your joy can be imagined. In the past, Zhang Xueliang abandoned several provinces without a fight. If he is guilty, then Feng Yuxiang should be credited for recovering millions of square miles of lost territory in one fell swoop. The national legal system punishes the guilty and rewards the meritorious. In a democratic political system, talented and intelligent people should be promoted. This is for the benefit of the country, not just for personal gain in a monarchical era. Yuxiang is a rare and outstanding talent, praised throughout the country. In the current state of national affairs, we are seeking a Tian Dan or a Tan Daoji, which may not be possible. I, Liejun, believe that the government should issue a clear order granting him authority, showing him the guidelines, and jointly supporting the precarious situation. This will demonstrate the sincerity of the central government in governing the country and will satisfy the people's desire for talented people. Uniting comrades, securing the interior, and resisting foreign aggression, there is no greater way than this. If not, what will the world say? As a member of the central government, I fear that the government will be misled into unrighteousness and laughed at by friendly nations. Therefore, I again offer unwelcome advice, hoping to invite a humble ear. As for the fate of Long Feng and Bi Gan, I dare not avoid it. Li Liejun.</p>

He was greeted by Bureau Chief Wen Hong'en and Wen Huaizhou, attached to the first regiment of the Municipal Security Department. Prior to this, the bureau dispatched a squad of policemen from the first squadron of the police brigade to serve as guards, and a military band was sent to play music to welcome him. The situation was very solemn. After Mr. Baille got out of the car, he was led into the reception room by Mr. Wen, and Bureau Chief Wen opened champagne to entertain him. They talked happily until 10:30 before he left.</p>
<h3>Tianchu Aircraft Damaged During Test Flight</h3>
<p>Entry into Factory for Repairs Postpones Naming Ceremony</p>
<p>Aviation Administration's Two Aircraft Returned to Hangzhou Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>The Tianchu aircraft was originally scheduled to have its naming ceremony today. The Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Military Affairs have all appointed senior officials to attend the event. The flight instructors sent by the Aviation Administration, as well as two similar fighter planes, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. Unexpectedly, before the acceptance inspection, the German pilot damaged the wheel axle and the rotating needle when landing during a test flight. It can only be used after repairs are completed. Therefore, the naming ceremony was also postponed. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Damage During Test Flight</h3>
<p>The aircraft was shipped to Shanghai, where a test flight was conducted by a German pilot. Only after our side was satisfied would it be accepted. The day before yesterday, the flight instructors and two Junkers fighter planes sent by the Aviation Administration flew from Hangzhou, arriving at Hongqiao Airport at 10:00 a.m. The German factory was immediately notified for a test flight and acceptance inspection. Unexpectedly, during the test flight landing, due to the mediocre skills of the pilot, the landing was too abrupt, causing the two wheel axles to break, and the nose rotating needle also touched the ground and broke. Lin Wojiang, Secretary-General of the Aviation Association, immediately rushed to Hongqiao Airport to inspect after receiving a telephone report. The aircraft was then transported to the aviation factory for repairs. Since our side has not yet accepted it, all repair responsibilities are borne by the German factory. The naming ceremony was thus postponed.</p>
<h3>Request to Replace Aircraft</h3>
<p>The "Ta Mei Evening News" reported that the Junkers all-metal fighter plane donated by Tianchu MSG Factory was originally scheduled to have its naming ceremony this afternoon. However, yesterday morning, the German pilot, while flying the plane for the second test flight in the sky above Hongqiao Airport, suddenly touched the ground during landing, causing the landing gear, wings, and engine to be damaged quite severely, making repairs difficult. It is said that Tianchu Factory will ask Junkers Company to replace it with a new aircraft. Therefore, the naming ceremony will be postponed indefinitely. Junkers is a famous German aircraft manufacturer. Recently, it departed from Berlin.</p>
<h3>Two Aircraft Return to Hangzhou</h3>
<p>The aviation school instructors and the two fighter planes sent by the Aviation Administration, because the naming ceremony of the Tianchu aircraft was postponed, had no need to stay in Shanghai for long, so they flew back to Hangzhou in the original aircraft at 8:00 a.m. yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Central Government Sends Personnel</h3>
<p>The Aviation Association telegraphed to various central government agencies on the 13th, requesting them to send senior officials to attend the ceremony. Yesterday, it received the following four reply telegrams: ㈠ The Central Party Headquarters telegraphed, "To the Aviation Association, having received your telegram, the Central Committee has decided to request Committee Member Wu Tiecheng to represent us. We have telegraphed to inform them. Sincerely, the Secretariat of the Central Executive Committee." ㈡ The National Government telegraphed, "(Omitted titles) Upon the President's order, your telegram has been received. We have telegraphed Committee Member Kong to represent us at the event. Please take note. Sincerely, Wei Huai, Chief of Civil Affairs, National Government." ㈢ The Executive Yuan telegraphed, "(Omitted titles) Your telegram has been received. We admire your enthusiasm. In addition to sending Chief Secretary Chu Minyi of this Yuan to represent us at the ceremony, we especially telegraph our thanks. Sincerely, Wang Zhaoming, Premier of the Executive Yuan." ㈣ The Ministry of Military Affairs telegraphed, "(Omitted titles) Your confidential telegram has been received. The naming ceremony for the Tianchu aircraft will be held tomorrow. This Ministry has sent Director Xu Peigen of the Aviation Administration to attend. Please take note. Sincerely, Chen Yi."</p>
<p>Tientsin Maru Carrying Passengers and Crew of the Tunam</p>
<h3>Arriving at 7:00 AM This Morning</h3>
<p>Berthing at the Whampoa Wharf</p>
<p>Bureau Sends Personnel to Care for Them</p>
<p>After the merchant ship Tunam was sunk by the Changchun Maru, the rescued crew and passengers, traveling from Dalian on the Tientsin Maru, are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 7:00 a.m. this morning. The China Merchants Bureau has appointed special personnel to go to the wharf to receive them. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Arriving in Shanghai This Morning</h3>
<p>The fifty-three crew members and thirty-six passengers rescued from the Tunam, traveling from Dalian on the Dalian Steamship Company's Tientsin Maru, are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 7:00 a.m. this morning, according to an announcement by the Dalian Steamship Company yesterday. They will berth at the Whampoa Wharf on Yangshupu Road. Liu Hongsheng, General Manager of the China Merchants Bureau, has designated Lian Ruigen of Junanhui and Xu Fusheng, a bureau staff member, and eight others to go to the wharf to care for them and provide maintenance funds for temporary resettlement. The Chinese Seamen's Union has sent Wang Yongsheng and others to the wharf to receive them.</p>
<h3>Serious Negotiations</h3>
<p>Since the Tunam was sunk by the Changchun Maru, the China Merchants Bureau immediately sent Secretary Wang to conduct preliminary negotiations with the Dalian Steamship Company. Unexpectedly, the Dalian Steamship Company replied in a letter that it would not be held responsible. Now, Director Gao of the Ministry of Transportation has arrived in Shanghai and decided that after receiving a detailed report from shipowner Jiang Changqing today, he will make a serious representation on Monday (i.e., tomorrow). As for the total number of crew members who drowned, it will be clear today, but the total number of passengers still cannot be ascertained.</p>
<h3>Union's Expression</h3>
<p>The Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union held its third committee meeting yesterday. The report from Zha Ke and the Shanghai Seamen's Union Provisional Steering Committee on this matter was considered to be serious and caused great indignation. The following five measures were decided upon: ㈠ A letter to the China Merchants Bureau regarding all the post-disaster handling issues for the victims and the families of the deceased should be discussed by the bureau sending formal representatives to consult with the union. There are approximately four points regarding relief measures: (1) The deceased should be given preferential treatment in accordance with national laws and regulations; (2) Educational expenses for the children of the deceased should be subsidized until they graduate from secondary school; (3) Surviving crew members should be compensated according to the amount of loss incurred, and wages should continue to be paid during the period of unemployment, with cabin stewards receiving the same treatment; (4) Efforts should be made to arrange positions for unemployed crew members affected by the disaster, and vacancies on various ships should be filled as soon as possible. As for the arrival in Shanghai of personnel affected by the disaster, a serious representation should be made to achieve compensation for losses and ensure that the same incident does not occur again in the future, in order to maintain maritime rights. ㈢ Director Wang Yongsheng of the Investigation Section will represent the union to comfort the affected employees arriving at the wharf. ㈣ An order will be issued to all seamen's organizations in the city that the union is now responsible for handling this case, and there should be no more independent actions, in order to unify authority and facilitate progress. ㈤ The affected workers and families of the deceased workers will be notified to register with the union immediately in order to tally the amount of losses and facilitate negotiations. The registration office has already been organized and is still attached to the temporary office of the Maritime Federation at 60 Bund Road for the sake of convenience.</p>
<h3>Party Headquarters' Important Telegram</h3>
<p>The Preparatory Committee of the Seamen's Special Party Headquarters sent a letter to the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating: We have learned that the China Merchants Bureau's Tunam ship on the Northern Seas route was destroyed and sunk by the Japanese ship Changchun Maru in Shandong waters. The incident occurred suddenly, and the losses were huge. Many passengers and crew members were killed. According to maritime conventions and nautical customs, the party responsible for the maritime disaster should be held liable for all losses. The Tunam incident is no exception. Therefore, we are writing to your ministry to investigate the actual losses as soon as possible, and to make a serious representation to the Japanese side, demanding compensation, clarifying responsibility, and facilitating post-disaster relief. Please investigate and handle accordingly.</p>
<p>Li Du Goes to Nanjing and then to Jiangxi</p>
<p>Reports Everything to the Central Government and Discusses Arrangements</p>
<p>After Zeng Yijing Returns to Shanghai</p>
<h3>Receiving the Press to Report on the Progress</h3>
<p>Speed of 85 Miles Per Hour // Hull Repaired, Will Fly to Xiamen Immediately Zeng Yijing, Chief of the Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Department, and pilot Mr. Poole flew the self-made Jiangfeng seaplane from Shanghai on the 15th of last month for a long-distance flight along the river. After arriving at Yuezhou, due to damage to the hull, they returned to Hankou to board the Jianguo ship and arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. At 10:00 a.m. yesterday morning, the press was received to report on the flight progress and the coastal flight plan. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Up the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>Director Zeng reported on the long-distance flight along the river, stating: The Jiangfeng aircraft departed at 9:12 a.m. on June 15. The weather was overcast and there was light rain, but it gradually cleared. At 9:37 a.m., it passed Gaoqiao, and the sun shone, and the climate gradually became hot. At 10:14 a.m., Tongzhou could be seen in the distance. At 11:05 a.m., it arrived at Zhenjiang, circled the city several times, and landed on the river. It was originally scheduled to refuel and fly to Nanjing after lunch, but unexpectedly the starter of the engine did not rotate, and it could not be carried out. After completing the repairs on the spot, at 9:15 a.m. the next day, the 16th, it went to the capital. It arrived at 9:47 a.m., and the aircraft parts were inspected. After lunch on the Ninghai naval ship, just as it was about to go to the Ministry of the Navy to report, Minister Chen had already arrived on the Ninghai ship to listen to the instructions. Then, it prepared for departure, at 1:38 p.m. The weather was sunny, but the waves were turbulent, and the current was rapid. The hull sped on the water surface, which felt difficult. Before long, it left the water and circled the city for more than ten minutes, and left Nanjing for Wuhu at 1:50 p.m. It arrived at the port at 6:25 p.m. Before long, the weather changed, and the waves were violent, and it seemed that there would be wind and rain, so the decision was made to delay the trip. That night, it stayed on the Jiankang fishing boat. Early the next morning, the 17th, at 10:10 a.m., it left Wuhu. It arrived at Anqing at 11:18 a.m., had lunch on the Yongkang warship. In the afternoon, the wind was not good, and the waves turned huge. It waited until 5:42 p.m. before leaving Anqing. It arrived at Xunyang at 6:35 p.m., and stayed on the Yongsui warship. That night, there was a violent storm. The plane stayed behind the helm of the Yongsui all night. It was hit by the wind and waves. It was thought that the hull was injured. The next morning, it rained and it was dragged behind the customs ship to avoid the gale. On the 19th, the wind and rain subsided slightly, and the whole aircraft was inspected. The aircraft itself was strongly built, and there was no problem. The flight was also very stable, with only 1,750 revolutions per hour. The speed was 80 to 85 miles per hour. If 2,000 revolutions were opened, the maximum speed would always be around 100 miles.</p>
<h3>Hull Leaks</h3>
<p>However, it was found that there was some water in the middle dam of the right hull. After draining it, at 9:00 a.m. on the 20th, it flew to Hankou. It arrived at Wuhan at 10:30 a.m. There were slight winds and waves when landing, and the current was especially rapid. Under its impact, the bottom plate was broken, and water entered the middle dam, so that the buoyancy of the two hulls was uneven. If the design did not have double the buoyancy, the whole plane would have been in danger of tilting and sinking. The plane was immediately hoisted onto the Weisheng warship, and craftsmen were sent from Shanghai to escort the spare hull. It arrived on the morning of the 26th, and was quickly installed and replaced. At 11:40 a.m. on the morning of the 27th, it flew to Yuezhou and arrived at 1:15 p.m. When landing at the mouth of Dongting Lake, the waves were large, and the two hulls touched the water unevenly, and the force was uneven. The hull and the hull column vibrated the whole seat. If the steel joint was not very strong, the damage would not have been limited to the slight leak in the right hull. On the evening of the 28th, the craftsmen were sent to Yuezhou to temporarily repair it on the water. It flew back to Hankou at 6:30 a.m. on the 30th, and then hoisted it onto the Xiansheng warship, so that the outside of the hull could be reinforced and repaired. It was completed on the 4th. At that time, the weather and wind were also unfavorable. It reluctantly set off on the morning of the 6th. Because it took too long, it could not make the trip to Changsha, Shashi, and Yichang, and it could not wait for the weather for a long time, so it quickly flew back to Shanghai to continue the flights to Zhejiang, Fujian, and Xiamen. Unexpectedly, a defect was found in the hull on the way, and the voyage was only possible out of fear of accidents, without the right to remedy. Therefore, it folded back to Hankou for detailed inspection. All parts had no weaknesses, but the hull could not withstand the violent impact of the water flow, and it was feared that it would be difficult to provide coastal flights. Therefore, it was decided to dismantle and transport it to Shanghai, reorganize, and make coastal flights to Fujian and Xiamen. Although this trip failed to complete the original planned flight, in terms of manufacturing experience, it cannot be said that it was a waste of time. I absolutely do not pessimistically go because of it.</p>
<p>Repair Completed, Fly South</p>
<p>After the Jiangfeng seaplane was shipped from Hankou on the China Merchants Bureau's Jianguo ship to Shanghai, the hull was dismantled yesterday and rushed to be repaired by the aircraft manufacturing department. However, the fuselage and various parts were undamaged and placed in the warehouse of the aircraft manufacturing department. As for the second coastal long-distance flight, it was decided to wait until the Jiangfeng hull was repaired before conducting a test flight and mooring it outside Wusongkou to test whether the hull could withstand the impact of the waves. If it is sturdy and resistant to waves, it will make a coastal flight, but the fastest may be after two weeks. After arriving in Xiamen, the Jiangfeng aircraft will be handed over to the Xiamen training department for training purposes. Director Zeng will then return to Shanghai with the pilot Mr. Poole.</p>
<p>After staying in Nanjing for a while to deal with the post-disaster issues of his subordinates, he will go to Jiangxi to visit Committee Member Jiang, and then go north to Tianjin to visit his relatives, and will not return to Shanghai for the time being.</p>
<h3>Japan Plans to Occupy Northeast China</h3>
<p>Attention Should Be Paid to the Activities of the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army</p>
<p>The Enemy Exhausts All Efforts and Strives for New Plans</p>
<p>A Cunning Coexistence Shows that Soviet Russia is Accommodating</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, after the violent Japanese occupied the three northeastern provinces of our country, they immediately created a puppet organization and actively built it to stabilize it. However, although the local volunteer army is under iron hooves, it is still fighting hard to escape this. Recently, news was received from the area, detailing various recent conditions. The following is revealed:</p>
<h3>Highway Construction</h3>
<p>The Japanese in Northeast China are now working hard to complete 60,000 kilometers of highways in the Kai-Luo style. The period is ten years, and preparations are made for the development of the Northeast and the maintenance of security. The first steps are as follows: ㈠ Yilan to Boli, 100 kilometers long, is currently being designed; ㈡ Hailin to Ning'an, 25 kilometers long, is being surveyed; ㈢ Hailin to Muling, 120 kilometers long, is being planned; ㈣ Guandi to Dunhua, 162 kilometers long, is being surveyed; ㈤ Huai'de to Gongzhuling, 100 kilometers long, has already started; ㈥ Changchun to Fuyu, 160 kilometers long, is being surveyed; ㈦ Changchun to Jilin, 114 kilometers long, has already started; ㈧ Changchun to Yitong, 72 kilometers long, has already started;</p>
<h3>Electrical Facts</h3>
<p>The electrical industry in the eastern provinces is now actively being renovated and expanded. A five-year business plan for the Manchurian Telegraph and Telephone Company has been drafted. The main business is defined as follows: ㈠ Renovation of current construction projects; ㈡ Expansion projects: (A) Increase in wired telegraphs and telephones; (B) Increase in major cities; (C) Establishment of new wireless telegraphs and telephones; (D) Increase in large power delivery stations; (E) Acquisition of major privately-run electrical businesses;</p>
<h3>Air Defense Exercises</h3>
<p>The puppet organization, under the guidance of the Japanese army, is also conducting air defense exercises. The air defense exercise in Shenyang City was held on June 24. First, all the city's lights were turned off, and citizens were cooperated with. At night, listening devices, searchlights, anti-aircraft guns, and machine guns were pre-positioned in the Japanese-occupied areas. During the exercise, several dummy enemy planes came along the Pseudo-Fengshan Railway line and carried out modification defense battles.</p>
<h3>Pseudo-Fleet History</h3>
<p>The Pseudo-Jiang Defense Fleet Command is located in Harbin. The Pseudo-Commander Yin Zuogan has five river gunboats directly under the Pseudo-Executive Government, and operates under the command of the Pseudo-Minister of Military Affairs. From May to October, the work is as follows: ㈠ In May of last year, it attacked the old Jilin army near Sanxing, and formed seven ship transportation regiments for the Japanese army, with about 200 ships in total, and served as waterway guides. The most effective in this campaign was the warship Jiangqing, which contacted the Tonghe garrison and attacked the flank of the Jilin army at night. Lieutenant Colonel Yan Taichang, the captain of the ship, made great efforts. The ship received more than 200 rounds of bullets; ㈡ The Liji warship covered the village and brigade, and landed in front of the old Jilin army in Erdahezi; ㈢ The Japanese army's expedition to Jiamusi, Chuanhua, Suibin, Fujin, Tongjiang and other places in the lower reaches of the Songhua River all received great assistance from the Jiang Defense Fleet; ㈣ During the war against Ma Zhanshan, Jiangfang completely prevented Ma from crossing the river to attack; ㈤ During last year's floods, railway traffic was damaged by the anti-Japanese army from time to time, but Jiangdao was safe; ㈥ Three temporary naval ships dispatched by the Japanese navy in Heilongjiang and northern Manchuria cooperated with the army, and were commanded by Major Kobayashi, the temporary naval defense commander stationed in Hanpu;</p>
<h3>Russia and Japan Prepare for War</h3>
<p>㈠ The Chinese Eastern Railway is still closed, and only passenger cars can pass. The Russian side has raised the issue of sale and sent special personnel to handle it, but despite many meetings, it has not been successful; ㈡ Soviet Russia is implementing wartime preparations along the Heilongjiang River. Both banks of the Ussuri River and the Amur River have been undergoing construction. Recently, a large number of young specialized departments have been sent from the country to direct the construction of the project. The transportation of materials by car is extremely busy; ㈢ Outside Dalian, at 10:00 a.m. on June 15, a U.S. Navy plane was discovered. The Japanese military police are working hard to investigate;</p>
<h3>Activities of the Volunteer Army</h3>
<p>The activities of the anti-Japanese volunteer army in various places are as follows: ㈠ Araki Seishiro, the commander of the Xiongyuecheng garrison, led a team on the 14th and marched in the barren area west of Niuzhuang. At 9:30 a.m. on the 17th, they fought fiercely with the anti-Japanese volunteer army led by Lu Shile and others for two and a half hours after the rain. Commander Araki died in battle, and Lieutenant Takahashi and four others were seriously injured. Currently, Major Kawamura is leading about 1,500 Japanese and puppet troops to assist. To prevent Yingkou Shiqiao from being attacked, Lu and other anti-Japanese volunteer armies were only 200 people. On the 15th, Lu and others were taken away by 30 soldiers of the cavalry brigade commander Gao Jizu under Gao Yuewu, a puppet national salvation army. Mr. Gao only escaped with his life; ㈡ On the night of June 18, dozens of anti-Japanese volunteer soldiers attacked the Japanese garrison at Anshan Station. They were subordinates of Hai Kuanbei, of the Sheng unit; ㈢ At 4:30 p.m. on June 18, the 321st train between Dashiqiao and Tianzhuangtai West Station, including six plainclothes soldiers under Ji Hai, suddenly killed the road police, forced the locomotive to stop, and took away 42 passengers, including one Japanese. At 6:00 p.m., the police car drove up, but the anti-Japanese volunteer army had already gone far away; ㈣ At 8:30 a.m. on the 19th, the train from Jilin to Xinjing derailed four freight cars and overturned two cars between Daohe and E'hezhuo at 1:00 p.m. because the tracks had been destroyed by 40 anti-Japanese volunteer soldiers. Inside, 30 Manchurian garrison troops were captured by the volunteer army. After the Japanese army received the report, fifty soldiers led by Lieutenant Nakaza and below led an armored train to attack. At 4:00 p.m., a detachment of infantry was dispatched from Jilin; ㈤ One hundred anti-Japanese volunteer soldiers were found near Xiaojiuzhan in Jidong, while 200 anti-Japanese volunteer soldiers were found in Ershengdian and other places on the night of June 11, and they were attacking Dongding. Currently, the Japanese and puppet troops are jointly attacking by the Jilin Garrison Second Brigade and the Japanese army unit; ㈥ The Japanese army and the Ning'an police formed several columns and marched south of Xiaocheng. From June 9 to the east of Jingbo Lake, one column of the Dahuanggou encounteres and fought fiercely with 250 anti-Japanese volunteer soldiers.

More than a dozen people were killed or injured in the battle, while two policemen were killed; ㈨ The Yantongshan garrison team of the Japanese army's Changdun Road garrison cooperated with the puppet Jilin army on June 11 to attack the Dalishugou in the northeast, and engaged in battle with more than 200 anti-Japanese volunteer soldiers; ㈩ About 60 members of the First Regiment of the Northeast National Salvation Army in the Jingxing Lian area went north along the Yalu River on June 14 and camped overnight in the Wu Jianfang Tun, southeast of the Nianzi Mountain. The Japanese Nianzi Mountain garrison team heard about it and launched a surprise attack at 2:00 a.m. on the 15th. The results are unknown. A unit of the puppet police guard self-defense group stationed at the Ying'e Men Station carried more than a dozen guns to mutiny on the evening of June 7. The cavalry company of the Sixth Mixed Brigade of the Puppet Fengtian Province Guard Army stationed in Shancheng Town also killed the company commander on the night of June 9 and the entire company mutinied;</p>
<p>City Chamber of Commerce</p>
<h3>Submits a Request to Correct the Wharf and Dredging Fees</h3>
<p>Sugar Industry First Requests the Chamber of Commerce to Rise Up and Appeal</p>
<p>It Should Be Handled in Accordance with Article 15 of the Special Contract</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a submission from the city's Sugar Industry Association, stating that the two tariffs of wharf donation and dredging donation in the city are too heavy for merchants to bear, which hinders commercial development. A telegram was sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Municipal Government, requesting correction. The telegram is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Grain Industry Original Submission</h3>
<p>Due to the wharf donation and dredging donation hindering business, the industry has repeatedly expressed its pain and sincerely requested your association to correct the relevant revenue collection agencies and to reduce the fees. Now, the reasons for requesting correction and reduction are stated as follows: The wharf donation is collected by the municipal government and entrusted to the Jianghai Customs to collect it when collecting the regular tax. In May of the 20th year of the Republic of China, the municipal government and the Jianghai Customs signed a special contract. The first article stated that it should be collected at 1% of the import tax within the import tariff of the 20th year of the Republic of China, and the fifth article stated that the amount collected each year thereafter should not exceed the highest amount in previous years. The standard and limit for the collection of this donation are clearly defined. However, in recent years, the Jianghai Customs has not handled it in accordance with this, but has levied it at the current tax rate. Last year, the import tax on sugar suddenly doubled, and the donation has also doubled. It has both violated the standard for collection in the first article and violated the limit taken in the fifth article. It seems that this is inconsistent with the contract. The collection of unauthorized fees is undoubtedly unfair and arbitrary. The municipal government must be requested to promptly correct the Jianghai Customs and ensure that the import tax rate of the 20th year is used as the collection standard, in order to show reality. As for the dredging fee, there were clear regulations before the Republic of China, with an annual expenditure of 460,000 taels of customs silver. Afterwards, the Jianghai Customs began to collect 3%, called the dredging donation. At that time, the increase in the amount was still negligible. In recent years, customs duties have increased repeatedly, and this dredging donation has increased accordingly. Taking the import tax revenue of the Jianghai Customs in the 20th year as an example, it was 77,218,241.55 taels, with each tael of gold valued at 1.90 national currency. The 3% collected amounted to more than 4.4 million yuan, nearly ten times the amount stipulated before. It has been heard that the Dredging Bureau, due to abundant income, in addition to expanding its business and increasing expenditures, has still accumulated a large amount. Last winter, it was decided to purchase two dredging vessels for about 5 million yuan, ready to dredge the Gangsha Ocean, which shows that the cost of dredging is really not 3%. The dredging of the ocean is a national water conservancy project and has nothing to do with the partial dredging of the port. If the cost of dredging the sea is also taken from a portion of Shanghai importers, the injustice is great. The nation's treatment of merchants is based on equality, and a new plan should be made to ensure fairness. Considering its name and meaning, it should be limited to dredging the port. According to the old regulations, the annual fee should be specified, and the current 3% collection rate should be greatly reduced, otherwise, importers will suffer greatly. Therefore, everything is stated again in pain, and your association is kindly requested to appeal on its behalf in order to save the situation.</p>
<h3>Telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs</h3>
<p>To the esteemed Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing: It is noted that the Jyunpu (River Dredging) Surtax originated in the Boxer Protocol of 1901 and was revised around the first year of the Republic of China (1912). At that time, a new River and Harbor Construction Tax Agreement was concluded with the envoys of various countries to provide funds for the establishment of a River Dredging Bureau. It was funded by imposing a surtax on imported goods, with a limit of twenty years, meaning it should have been abolished long ago. Even if it is argued that the status quo must be maintained before the bureau is taken back and reorganized, according to the new agreement, the River Dredging Bureau's annual expenses were limited to 460,000 taels of customs silver. The Customs House was responsible for collecting it, and the surtax rate was also limited. In recent years, the Customs House has been collecting the River Dredging Surtax at a rate of 3% of the import tariff. This means its annual revenue has already exceeded the original amount. Even if it is not reduced in the future, it should not be increased further to comply with the original plan. Now that the new customs tax is in effect, the 3% River Dredging Surtax has increased in effect, which is inconsistent with the original agreement.</p>
<p>The act of creating such a trend and expanding revenue burdens both merchants and citizens and violates national dignity. Therefore, we respectfully request the Ministry to examine the matter, promptly instruct correction, and order the Customs House to reduce the River Dredging Surtax collection to the original collection amount. It must not increase the collection amount due to the implementation of the new tax. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce anxiously awaits your instructions.</p>
<h3>Submission to the Municipal Government</h3>
<p>Submission regarding a request: (Omitted content) It has been determined that the standards for the collection of the Wharf Tax were established according to the first and fifth articles of a special agreement signed between the Municipal Government and the Customs House in May of the 20th year (of the Republic: 1931), which stipulated that the tax should be collected at a rate of 1% of the import duty at the time and that it should not exceed the highest amounts from previous years. The meaning is very clear. The Customs House, as the implementing body, has arbitrarily increased the tax rate along with the increase in import duties, reaching nearly 4%, which is inconsistent with the original plan. Repeated requests have been made by the subordinate chamber to correct this. This matter greatly affects the burden and suffering of merchants and citizens, and it is difficult for your esteemed government, which is in a position of authority, to sit idly by and allow the Customs House to act on its own. It is necessary to make a solid correction. We respectfully submit this document and request that Your Excellency examine the matter, instruct a review of the original plan according to the agreement, and send a letter to the Customs House to revise the Wharf Tax to a smaller amount, complying with the established plan, alleviate commercial difficulties. This would be a public convenience. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Government.</p>
<h3>Wu Huanzhang Returned to Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Wu Huanzhang, the representative of General Ma Zhanshan, went to Beijing a few days ago to meet with key figures in the central government to discuss the resettlement of his subordinates. He returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. According to a reporter from the Riri News Agency, Mr. Wu said that the central government had agreed to do its best to find a way to resettle his subordinates and that the result was satisfactory. Mr. Wu said that he would report the details of the negotiations to General Ma immediately.</p>

<p>Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, arrived in Shanghai by train at 0:25 yesterday morning. After getting off the train, he went straight to his residence on Columbia Road to rest. Regarding the rumors that Finance Minister Soong had borrowed money from England, Sun said that this was not true. It is understood that the Legislative Yuan has decided to adjourn for four weeks starting next week because of the hot weather, and Sun plans to take this opportunity to accompany Madam Lu to Qingdao for the summer.</p>
<h3>Ninghai and Other Warships Returned from Guangdong</h3>
<p>Chen Shaokuan Says He Cannot Persuade Haiqi</p>
<p>Everything Hereafter Must Still Obey Central Orders</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the central government sent the Ninghai, Hairong, and Yixian warships, led by Chen Jiliang, commander of the First Fleet, to Guangdong to persuade the Haiqi, Haichen, and Zhaohe warships that had fled to Qingdao to return. When the three warships heard that the central navy was coming to Guangdong, they took shelter in Whampoa. As a result, the Ninghai and other three warships arrived at Chiwan near Hong Kong. Unable to make contact, they turned back to Shanghai. The Ninghai arrived in Shanghai at 10:00 yesterday morning and entered Gaochangmiao Port. At the same time, Minister of the Navy Chen Shaokuan also arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. He planned to meet with Commander Chen Jiliang who had returned. A reporter met with Chen at the Jiangnan Shipyard yesterday. Chen said that the Ninghai and other three warships had originally intended to persuade the Haiqi and others to return, but after arriving in Guangdong, the Haiqi had fled to the Pearl River, so they returned after reaching Chiwan, fearing that further progress would cause other misunderstandings. The Ninghai has now returned to Shanghai, and the Yixian has also returned to Songkou and is stationed there. The Hairong is taking on coal and water in Fuzhou due to supply issues and will arrive in Shanghai within two or three days. The former Hai Chou, which sailed out, was not heading to Guangdong, but to Fujian Province to be stationed. The Navy Ministry has no opinion on how to deal with the Haiqi and other warships and that will be a matter for the central government. The Zhenhai, Dinghai, Yongxiang, Chuyu, Tong'an, Jiangli, Haiou, and Hai Ships that had once fled to Shidao are now docked in Qingdao and have not sailed elsewhere. Regarding the unification of the navy, I (Chen) had already suggested this to the central government long ago. Even if the proposal is not accepted, I plan to start with naval construction. Fortunately, the newly built ships were mostly saved by naval personnel. The Pinghai project is still delayed today due to lack of funds. Commander Zeng Yiding returned from his inspection, and I met with him in Beijing. I will return to Beijing tomorrow after handling the affairs.</p>
<h3>Fishery Construction Fee Resolved Through Mediation Yesterday</h3>
<p>Construction Fee Collected at 1% in Accordance with Ministry Order</p>
<p>Fish Imported and Exported from Various Places No Longer Subject to Double Taxation The Jiang-Zhejiang Fisheries Improvement Association's amended implementation regulations implement ocean patrol vessels and collected construction fees, which caused disputes. The Ministry of Industry requested Yu Qiaqing, Du Yuesheng, Yu Zuoting, and others to convene representatives of fish merchants for two rounds of mediation, but no agreement could be reached. It is now learned that Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo, after arriving in Shanghai yesterday, immediately instructed the original mediators to convene representatives of Jiang-Zhejiang fisheries, including Meng Lujiu, for a third round of mediation at the Ningbo Association in Shanghai at 4:00 p.m. Minister Chen also came to the association and waited in a separate room. A compromise has been reached, which both parties consider satisfactory. The New News Agency has learned the details and recorded them as follows.</p>
<h3>Attendees</h3>
<p>Jiang-Zhejiang Fisheries Improvement Mediation - Yu Qiaqing, Du Yuesheng, Yu Zuoting, Representatives of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Shaoxing, Jinhua, Quzhou, Yanzhou, and Chuzhou - Meng Lujiu, Representative of Shanghai - Hu Diansun, Representative of Ningbo - Le Badong, and more than ten fish merchants such as Zhang Zhisun and Yang Chuanru.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>Chairman Yu Qiaqing, recorded by Lin Zitong, after the formalities, the chairman reported, stating that the Jiang-Zhejiang Fisheries Improvement Association had disputes over the collection of fisheries construction fees. Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Ningbo, Dinghai, Shipu, and other places opposed the collection of various fees by the collection office, which caused harassment and extortion. There was also an organization called the Jiang-Zhejiang Fisheries United Association. The speaker himself and others convened various fish merchants for two mediations, but no agreement was reached. Today, Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo, after arriving in Shanghai from Beijing, again instructed the speaker, Mr. Du Yuesheng, and Mr. Yu Zuoting to conduct a third mediation. The speaker hoped that the various fish merchants would dispel their opinions and abide by the Ministry of Industry's measures so that the construction of the fisheries could gradually advance. If fish merchants did have difficult situations, they might as well raise them for discussion and long-term consideration.</p>
<h3>Representatives' Proposals</h3>
<p>After the chairman finished his report, Meng Lujiu, the representative of the eight fish merchants from Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Shaoxing, Huzhou, Jinhua, Quzhou, Yanzhou, and Chuzhou, made a proposal. It stated that the Jiang-Zhejiang Fisheries Improvement Association Construction Fee Collection Office had violated the law and caused harassment, which had led to fish merchants in various places to appeal for a ban. While the appeal was in progress, they were grateful to the speakers and others for accepting the intentions of Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry and serving as mediation committee members. They had worked hard and sincerely. The fish merchants were infinitely grateful and grateful. But so-called mediation should resolve disputes by reconciling opinions from all parties. The speaker was a representative of the fish merchants from the eight prefectures of Zhejiang. He presented the opinions of the fish merchants as follows: 1. Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry may have difficulties in implementing policies to improve the fisheries for the sake of the national economy and the people's livelihood. The fish merchants now understand and are willing to abide by the ministry's orders. 2. For fresh fish, since the importing fish merchants have already paid the tax once, there should be no obligation to pay taxes again when they are transferred to various places. For example, in the eight prefectures of Zhejiang, only Hangzhou, Zhapu, and Shaoxing have ocean-imported fresh fish boats that go upstream to sell. The construction fee of 1% is calculated annually, but it is only three to four thousand yuan. Moreover, the fresh fish sold in the aforementioned eight prefectures is sold by wholesalers in Shanghai and Ningbo. The construction fee has already been paid by the wholesalers in Shanghai and Ningbo. It is unreasonable to collect the tax again at the transit point. A clear order should be issued to stop this to avoid disturbances. 3. The collection offices use the Ministry of Industry's orders to require all transit shops and transport companies to pay taxes on all types of goods, such as salted and dried goods, at the train stations and ports of entry, otherwise they will be fined. They even use armed police to threaten and hire gangsters to seize goods. It is not known that the domestic salted and dried goods have already been taxed by the importing fish merchants in accordance with the regulations. The transport merchants in various places are still paying taxes. If the responsibility of collecting taxes can be extended to fish merchants, then where will it end? Such layered and overlapping taxes are more harsh than likin. They are creating deep wounds and are difficult to endure. Why are the authorities of the Fisheries Improvement Association creating opportunities for the collection personnel to enrich themselves? The implementation regulations should be revised to avoid insatiable demands. 4. Since the construction fee is collected by the fish merchants in accordance with the ministry's orders for the sake of improving welfare, the fish shops have a voluntary obligation to collect the tax. They are no different from the tax collection personnel of the Improvement Association. The Improvement Association's authority over the fish shops is also the supervising body. There is no need to set up a collection office. Moreover, the establishment of a collection office is costly and creates obstacles, which is detrimental to the national economy and the people's livelihood. It would be better to improve than to retreat, and better to build than to cause disputes. There is much that is inconsistent. Once the disadvantages are opened, it is difficult to block the gaps. This is especially necessary to convey the situation to the authorities. 5. The principle of using ocean patrol vessels for fisheries by the Ministry of Industry is of great importance to the future of the fisheries. It is necessary to build strong ships as soon as possible and to patrol the ocean regularly to protect fishermen and develop the fishing industry. The necessary funds should be spent practically and announced seriously. 6. The evidence of Wu Weinan, director of the collection office in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Shaoxing, who violated the law and caused disturbances, has been submitted to the Ministry of Industry for review. The evidence that Dai Yongtang, director of the general collection office, sent a letter to the Ningbo Salted Goods Association to forge seals of the eight fishermen's associations is also kept at Mr. Du Yuesheng's office for verification. The Ministry should be immediately informed to warn others. 7. In addition to domestic salted and dried goods, the government has its own authority to weigh how to improve the levy of taxes on imported salted goods to protect national rights. The fish merchants have no objection. 8. At a time when the fish merchants are suffering deeply, the speakers are generously embracing them, opening a meeting to mediate. As representatives of the eight fish merchants, the speakers are deeply grateful. They also hope that the speakers will have a broad vision and forward these opinions to the central industrial department.</p>
<h3>Discussion Results</h3>
<p>The mediators Yu Qiaqing, Du Yuesheng, Yu Zuoting, and the representatives discussed the results and explored the following: 1. The 1% construction fee will remain unchanged in accordance with the Ministry's order. 2. A 1% construction fee will be implemented on imported salted fish on July 16. The fee will be paid by the fish merchants to the Jiang-Zhejiang Fisheries Improvement Association. 3. The collection fee for fresh fish will be gathered again. The previous ocean protection fee will be used as the construction fee. 4. Only one construction fee will be allowed to be collected for fish imported, exported, and transported to various places. 5. All other marine equipment will be exempted. 6. The construction fee collection office should be abolished and handled by the Jiang-Zhejiang Fisheries Improvement Association. 7. Various expenses should be spent practically and announced seriously. There should be no false names or arbitrary changes. 8. The implementation regulations should be revised. 9. Implement ocean patrol vessels to protect the safety of the fisheries.</p>
<h3>Minister's Opinion</h3>
<p>After the mediators adjourned the meeting, they immediately reported the mediation situation to Minister Chen Gongbo of the Ministry of Industry. Minister Chen stated that the mediators Yu Qiaqing and others had repeatedly mediated the construction fee dispute, and their hard work was admirable. The various discussions were also fair and impartial, taking into account both sides. I will sincerely accept and implement each item within the possible range. The collected construction fees will be kept in custody by Mr. Lin Kanghou for planning the construction. The mediators and representatives all thought the result satisfactory and departed.</p>
<p>Shanghai Telephone Bureau</p>
<h3>Preparing to Cancel Five-Cent Call Fee</h3>
<p>Reply to the Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation replied to the Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating, "Regarding the direct reply, the official letter states that the Chinese-foreign call fee is an unprecedented practice in various countries. It was adopted at the time when a manual switchboard system was used or it was an expedient measure. It was recently reported that it would be cancelled, which is comforting to the masses. However, it has not yet been implemented. It should be resolutely abolished and a reply should be given. Upon receipt, the details are thorough and your fame is admirable. This bureau expresses its sympathy. However, this matter has been repeatedly and earnestly discussed with the Shanghai Telephone Company. The company has not agreed because the economic losses are too great. For the convenience of the public, for the development of public and private businesses, and for the bright future of state-owned enterprises, this bureau should endure the pain and sacrifice. If the company still cannot agree in the shortest period of time, then the bureau will only implement it independently and do its best to meet the expectations of the citizens. Regarding the aforementioned reasons for the letter, a reply is sent accordingly. Please note."</p>
<p>Taxpayer Association Letter to the Public Works Department</p>
<h3>Collect Pawnshop Tax According to Original Regulations</h3>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Public Settlement sent a letter to the Public Works Department yesterday, stating, "Regarding the opening, the Shanghai Pawnshop Industry Association has sent a letter stating that the industry belonging to the Open Society, used to complain the Public Works Department, charges the donation tax, does not according to the original regulations of scraping the original copy of 2 per 1000, and easy to get a new law, not only violating the principle of revenue collection, also can not afford, Repeated calls were ineffective, it was very usefull, Then, after reporting the situation to your association, the letters were sent in succession, and the Public Works Department had a preconceived idea, and the request was not resolved. At the time of the business failure, the donation was increased instead of being increased, which was more urgent than rescue, and the business was in danger of being suspended due to the inability to afford it. As a result, the industry has requested to restore the original regulations. After the colleagues in the boundary reported, from the summer of the nineteenth year of the Republic of China when the Public Works Department changed the chapters to collect the donation from, to the spring of this year, within three years, the actual number of various pawnshops, and the donation amount collected by the Public Works Department. After comparison, the Public Works Department knew that it had collected more than 9,348 yuan in donation tax. Therefore, the original form is attached to repeat the letter to your association for inspection, and please use it to continue to make practical representations to the Public Works Department, so that the purpose of restoring the original regulations can be achieved by proving the facts, etc. Upon approval, this association has sent a letter to your bureau in April of this year regarding the donation of the pawnshop industry, expressing specific opinions, and hoped to adopt them to comply with the financial principle of not taxing the capital but taxing the profit. It is hoped that the source of taxation will not be fundamentally eliminated, resulting in a reduction in tax revenue. This is hereby addressed to the Director-General of the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Public Settlement.</p>

<h3>Anhui People Request Removal of Regiment Commander Ni</h3>
<p>Representatives Come to Shanghai to Complain to Fellow Provincials</p>
<p>The banditry in the counties of northern Anhui is very rampant. In January of this year, the 2nd Infantry Regiment of the Anhui Security Department, led by Ni Rongxian, was stationed in the area of Shouxian, Hefei, and Shucheng. The areas through which the troops passed suffered even more severely than the bandits. The people, intimidated by their power, dared not file complaints. Recently, Ji Cunhua and Yuan Dajun, representatives of the county's people, came to Shanghai and listed the illegal acts of Regiment Commander Ni in Hefei, requesting the fellow provincials in Shanghai to forward the complaints to the National Government, the Military Commission, the Control Yuan, and the Anhui Provincial Government, requesting the removal of the commander to alleviate the people's suffering in the bandit areas. The fellow provincials in Shanghai were extremely indignant and are currently negotiating with the provincial government and various parties.</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau</p>
<h3>Wusong Office Groundbreaking Ceremony Yesterday</h3>
<p>| Mayor Wu Tiecheng Attended in Person |</p>
<p>The groundbreaking ceremony for the Wusong Office of the Municipal Health Bureau was held in Wusong yesterday at about 2:00 p.m. Mayor Wu attended in person to preside over everything. In addition to officials from various bureaus of the Municipal Government, many Chinese and foreign guests also attended. The details are recorded as follows.</p>
<h3>Venue Arrangement</h3>
<p>The venue was located on the Jiangbian in Wusong Town. The arrangement was solemn. The Party and National flags were hung high at the entrance, flying in the wind. Armed police were stationed from the entrance of the Military Industry Road to the venue. A first-aid station was set up, equipped with medicines and doctors, to prevent heatstroke.</p>
<h3>Attendees</h3>
<p>The attendees included Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, Secretaries Zhang Tingrong and Tang Shixuan, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau Xu Peihuang, Director of the Public Security Bureau Wen Hongsi, Director of the Health Bureau Li Ting'an, Director of the Public Works Bureau Shen Yi, Director of the Land Bureau Jin Liren (represented by Fan Yongzeng), Director of the Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Industry He Zhuoxian, and others. Representatives from the health departments of the Public Settlement and the French Concession also attended. Among the guests were Liu Ruiheng, Yan Fuqing, Niu Huisheng, and many others.</p>
<h3>Mayor's Speech</h3>
<p>After the Director of the Health Bureau, Mr. Li Ting'an, reported on the preparations for the office, Mayor Wu delivered a brief speech, saying, "Today is the groundbreaking ceremony for the Wusong District Health Office. We are honored by the presence of representatives from both the Public Works Department and many foreign professors, who have braved the summer heat to attend. This is a source of great joy. The establishment of the Wusong Health Office can be seen as a harbinger of the revitalization of Wusong. Any place that has</p>
<p>undergone great destruction will inevitably experience a period of great construction. The construction after destruction will certainly be more prosperous than before. However, local undertakings depend entirely on the efforts of local leaders. In this district,</p>
<p>there is the Permanent Cotton Mill, which can serve as a leader in this area. As for the establishment of this office, Tongji University has provided particularly strong assistance. This is truly fortunate for the people of this district. I hope that all the people of Wusong will make further efforts, so that the future benefits will be far from insignificant."</p>
<h3>Groundbreaking Ceremony</h3>
<p>Across from the venue was the new site of the Wusong District Health Office. After the speeches,</p>
<p>Mayor Wu led everyone to the site to hold the groundbreaking ceremony. Amidst military music, Mayor Wu unveiled the national flag on the cornerstone, revealing the inscription: "Groundbreaking Stone of the Shanghai Wusong District Health Office, inscribed by Mayor Wu Tiecheng, July 1, 1933." After the ceremony, photographs were taken and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>International Narcotics Case</p>
<h3>Trial Postponed Due to Presiding Judge's Illness</h3>
<p>An American, Jules A. Styler (transliteration), who trafficked narcotics between San Francisco, USA, and Shanghai, was arrested by the police in San Francisco on May 13 and brought to court for questioning. The case implicated Yan Ziliang, a Ningbo native residing at No. 8 Huanlong Villa, Huanlong Road, French Concession, and Qin Cainan, a Wuxi native residing at No. 725 Foch Road, both in this city, as suspects. Based on letters from the American Consul, the French police dispatched detectives to search Yan's and Qin's residences, seizing account books and letters, and filed a public prosecution with the Second Special District Court. Because the police investigation was not concluded, the court repeatedly ordered postponements. Apart from Qin Cainan's case, which had been continued in court as reported previously, yesterday was the scheduled date for Yan Ziliang's trial. However, the presiding judge in charge of the case, Wang Gangxu, was slightly indisposed and requested leave. Therefore, at 10:30 am yesterday, Judge Xiong Huicui acted as a substitute, summoning Yan Ziliang to court in Criminal Court No. 1. After briefly questioning his age, origin, occupation, and address, he ordered a postponement, stating that the trial would resume after Judge Wang recovered from his illness. The court then adjourned.</p>
<p>He Dekui Speaks</p>
<h3>Concession Decides to Ban Nude Exercises</h3>
<p>Nude exercises have spread from Hong Kong to Shanghai. Recently, newspapers</p>
<p>have reported on this. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Concession have also sent letters to the Public Works Department, requesting a ban. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency made a special trip to inquire with the Public Works Department of the Public Concession. Mr. He Dekui, a committee member of the bureau, stated that, in fact, no such nude exercise groups have been found within the area under the jurisdiction of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, and the Public Works Department will not allow such exercises to exist. If anyone dares to try, they will be arrested and sent to court at any time, and severely punished as a warning to others. Cunning individuals often borrow a new and unusual term to appeal to the public, but in reality, nothing is more harmful to public morals than this. In order to maintain morality, this bureau will definitely not allow it to be implemented in the Shanghai Public Concession.</p>
<h3>Aviation Highway Lottery to be Drawn</h3>
<p>| To be Drawn at the Nanjing Grand Theater on July 31 |</p>
<p>The National Government Aviation Highway Construction Lottery is scheduled to be drawn in this city on July 31, as reported in this newspaper. The lottery office has carefully considered the location for the drawing and, it is said, has now decided to borrow the Nanjing Grand Theater. The theater is centrally located, has air conditioning, and has many seats, accommodating thousands of spectators, making it very suitable for the lottery drawing. The drawing time is from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm. Because there are 667 winning numbers from the first prize to the seventh prize, it will take approximately seven to eight hours to complete. As for the eighth prize and the ninth prize, which are the same as the last two digits or one digit of the first prize, there is no need to draw. During the drawing, in addition to the supervisory committee dispatched by the Construction Lottery Committee, local courts, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and the Bankers' Association will be present to supervise. People from China and abroad are welcome to visit the site. Also, three copper-made lottery machines are used, manufactured by the British company Ruirong, with flexible mechanisms, making them very suitable for the lottery drawing. They are currently on display at the lottery office for public viewing. It is also heard that the American company Fox Film Corporation believes that the first phase of the lottery drawing is excellent news material and plans to be on site to film a sound newsreel.</p>
<p>Medical Association</p>
<h3>Public Health Class Opens</h3>
<p>The Public Health Workshop sponsored by the Chinese Medical Association officially opened on the 15th. The workshop students are mostly doctors and public health agency staff from various parts of the country, totaling more than twenty people.

It is heard that Mr. Jiang Shicheng will teach environmental health on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday afternoons next week from 8:00 pm to 10:00 pm.</p>
<p>China Industrial Factory</p>
<h3>Layoff Dispute Resolved</h3>
<p>The China Industrial Factory on Bailinan Road, due to poor business, was resolved by the shareholders' meeting to dissolve and liquidate. All workers in the factory were laid off at the same time. Later, because the workers requested the factory to pay six months' severance pay, a dispute once occurred. Although the Social Bureau convened mediation, the factory insisted on handling it in accordance with the Factory Law. On one hand, the company's liquidation office separately calculated the wages that each worker should legally receive and announced for the workers to come and collect them. It is heard that there were more than 700 workers in the factory. As of yesterday, except for five or six people who had left Shanghai and had not collected their wages, all others had collected their wages in full. The factory's layoff dispute was thus completely resolved, and the liquidation office reported it to the Social Bureau for record.</p>
<h3>Summer Religious Lecture Series at the YMCA</h3>
<p>The Shanghai YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge will hold lectures on various religions every Sunday afternoon at 4:00 pm in the hall, introducing Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, Christianity, Islam, Datongism, and Zoroastrianism.

Today is the first lecture, with Mr. Jiang Weiqiao lecturing on "Comparison of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism." People from all walks of life are welcome to attend.</p>
<p>South China Chemical Society</p>
<h3>Counterfeit Perfume Brand Case Judged</h3>
<p>The South China Chemical Society at No. 4 Renshou Lane, Annerkin Road, French Concession, previously produced Butterfly brand tooth powder, which conflicted with the Invincible brand tooth powder produced by the Family Industrial Society, resulting in a dispute. The two sides engaged in a major war of words in the newspapers, which caused a sensation for a time. Now, because the South China Chemical Society again counterfeited the perfume brand of the French Paris Rouge Garnier factory, it was discovered by the factory's Shanghai office, Dibak Mansion, who reported it to the police. Detectives Lu Changsheng and others were dispatched to seize 4,004 boxes of counterfeit perfume and 23,600 printed labels. The manager, Xu Gongming, fled upon hearing the news. Only the clerk in charge, Zhang Jie, also known as Zhang Chunlai, was taken to the police station and sent to the Second Special District Court for public prosecution. The interrogation proved the facts to be true, and a sentence was ordered to be announced. As reported in the previous newspaper, yesterday was the scheduled date for the announcement. The police brought the defendant to court. Judge Zhang Chaozuo, sitting in Criminal Court No. 8, sentenced Zhang Jie to two months of imprisonment and a fine of 200 yuan for counterfeiting a registered trademark. The fine could be converted to imprisonment at a rate of two yuan per day. The number of days of detention before the judgment was finalized would be used to offset the sentence at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment, with a two-year reprieve. The seized counterfeit perfume and printed labels were confiscated. The defendant should compensate the plaintiff in the attached civil lawsuit for 114 yuan, and remain under the original bail pending the appeal period.</p>
<h3>Court Sends Madman</h3>
<p>| To Specialized Mental Hospital for Treatment |</p>
<p>The Ren'an Lane Mental Hospital on Guling Road in this city is founded by Dr. Gu Wenjun, an expert in treating madness, and philanthropic individuals such as Yuan Xiluo, Qiao Nianchun, and Xie Qiangong. After several months of preparation, it is ready and will officially open soon, as reported</p>
<p>as many as four or five people. Among them, two were sent by the First Special District Local Court. Dr. Gu Wenjun, the director of the hospital, has carefully diagnosed them. The original letter from the First Special District Local Court is recorded below: "To the esteemed Director: According to the Huishan Police Station, a male idiot named Dai Shiying was sent, and the Jing'an Temple Police Station sent an unnamed male idiot. Because they are noisy and unbearable, it is impossible to arrange them. Knowing that your hospital is charitable and is willing to accept poor idiots for treatment, we hereby send the two male idiots to your hospital, hoping you will admit them for treatment. This is a matter of public friendship."</p>
<h3>Three Cars at Crossroads</h3>
<p>A Chinese Car Speeding Through</p>
<p>French Military Vehicle Overturns, Incoming Car Damaged</p>
<p>At the corner of Qiqi Road and Fuli Road in the French Concession, at about 10 am yesterday, a car with license plate number 15909, a vehicle used by workers from the French Public Works Department, driven by a French soldier, was speeding south. At that time, a Westerner was driving a sedan with license plate number 4806, heading north. At the same time, a Chinese car was heading east from the west. When they all arrived at the intersection, the Chinese car sped straight through. The vehicle driven by the French soldier, seeing the car crossing the road, did not expect another car coming head-on. He tried to brake urgently, but because he was driving too fast, the car overturned, and gasoline spilled everywhere. The oncoming car, seeing the French soldier's vehicle approaching very quickly, fearing a collision, immediately reversed, causing it to hit the cement power pole, damaging the bumper and rear wheels, resulting in considerable loss.</p>

<h3>Heavy Thunderstorm in This City Yesterday</h3>
<p>Still Hot After the Rain</p>
<p>Yesterday's weather was extremely hot, just like the previous day. At 12:05 pm, there was a heavy downpour with thunder and lightning. The rain stopped at 2:00 pm, but the heat did not decrease slightly. The Fahrenheit thermometer still reached 98 degrees. Some say that if it were not for the heavy rain at noon, it would have reached over 100 degrees.</p>
<p>New Pharmaceutical Association Moves to Boycott</p>
<h3>Cote Cosmetics</h3>
<p>Because the Factory Owner Falsely Accuses China</p>
<p>The Shanghai Pharmaceutical Association, because of the article "French Newspaper Advocates French-Japanese Alliance to Suppress Our Nation" published in the Nanjing telegram on the second page of the Shenbao on the 12th of this month, the language is very absurd, obviously to promote Japan and falsely accuse our country, which is infuriating to read. The editor of the French newspaper is the owner of the Cote Cosmetics factory, and many of the goods exported by him are sold in our country's market. We should find ways to boycott it to show retaliation. Therefore, a special temporary meeting was held yesterday, and everyone agreed that only a few pharmacies sell the cosmetics produced by the factory. Other Jiangsu and Guangdong goods shops and various companies and sock factories</p>
<p>each sent letters to related associations and businesses to discuss countermeasures to promote the national spirit of our China.</p>
<p>Over 120,000 Yuan</p>
<h3>Massive Robbery Case Judged</h3>
<p>Zhang Huicai Sentenced to Ten Years and Six Months</p>
<p>Wang Maojian and Li Along Each Sentenced to Nine Years</p>
<p>Robbers Zhang Huicai (also known as Zhang Weicai, a Ningbo native), Wang Maojian (also known as Wang Yongchang, a local), and Li Along (also known as Scarface Along, a Suzhou native), etc., at 5:00 am on the 16th of last month, colluded with the escaped Da Luosong (namely Jiang Gaiyuan), A Tu, A Bao, Hunchback Lao Si, etc., and used weapons to rob Zhao Zhangyun, a Wenzhou merchant, on Xin Yong'an Street in the French Concession. Zhao was entrusted by the Shanghai Bank and others to deliver a huge amount of cash totaling 129,080 yuan to various banks and businesses in this city. They took it to room 224 of the Da Shanghai Hotel to divide the spoils and escape. Later, through the special supervision of Inspector Guan Yuan, detectives Zhang Ziying, Zhou Yaoting, Zhou Bingcheng, and the patrol detectives of the French Police Station, Zhang, Wang, and Li were arrested in Wuzhou Road and Jiahe in this city. The original stolen cash of 46,675 yuan was recovered and sent to the Second Special District Local Court. The police lawyer filed a public prosecution in accordance with the law. Judge Wang Gangxu of the Criminal Court held several hearings, questioning and confessing various facts, and the police department posted a reward in the newspaper to arrest the fugitives.</p>
<p>The case has been tried and concluded. Yesterday morning, the date for the judgment was reached. The police sent the defendants to the court. At 10:30 am, acting Judge Xiong Huihua presided over Criminal Court No. 1, ordering the criminals to be brought to court. After a brief questioning, he announced the judgment: Wang Maojian (Wang Yongchang) and Li Along were each sentenced to nine years of imprisonment for robbery with weapons by a group of three or more. Zhang Huicai (Zhang Weicai), a repeat offender, was sentenced to ten years and six months of imprisonment for robbery with weapons by a group of three or more. The number of days of detention before the judgment was finalized would be used to offset the sentence at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. After the judgment, the defendants were transferred to the detention center to await further instructions.</p>
<p>City Ferry</p>
<h3>Night Cruise Service Opens</h3>
<p>| Cool... Comfortable... Safe |</p>
<p>This city has a dense population, far more than other cities. Every summer, the heat is as scorching as steaming, lacking places to cool off. Although there are a few public and private gardens, they are not enough to be a popular summer resort and cannot meet the needs of social people. As for car rides, dust is blowing, and small boat rides are uncomfortable. In fact, neither is good. It is said that the City Ferry, in view of this, will use the original four high-quality ferries on the Shanggao line to start a night cruise service in shifts from the 8th of this month. The time is set at 8:30 pm every night, departing from the Bund Tongren Wharf on Nanjing Road, also stopping at Donggou Wharf, arriving at Gaoqiao at 10:00 pm, stopping for one hour. The boat departs from Gaoqiao at 11:15 pm that night, arriving back at Tongren Wharf at 12:30 am. This scheduled time will be maintained regardless of the number of passengers or the weather. The fare, regardless of distance, is one yuan for first class one way, and one yuan and sixty cents for a round trip ticket. The fare for second class one way is fifty cents, and eighty cents for a round trip ticket. (Infants are not entitled to half-price tickets for the night cruise. Round-trip tickets must be purchased at the ticket office on the pier. Only one-way tickets are sold on board.) In terms of equipment, the canvas seats are clean and comfortable, interspersed with potted flowers, emitting a faint fragrance. The radio broadcasts loudly and pleasantly. The railings are decorated with red and green electric lights. Young couples can enjoy the auditory and visual pleasures. As for coolness and safety, these are other matters. There are also exquisite Western pastries and cool drinks available on board, as desired by the guests. Upon returning at midnight, there are also taxi services available. Customers can call the staff on board at any time. Regardless of the distance, the fare is one yuan, which is very convenient. In addition to the original Kangdeli Hotel in Gaoqiao this year, a new seaside hotel has been newly opened, both with bars, elegant and quiet, enough for rest.</p>
<p>Continuing Kidnapping Four Times</p>
<h3>Large Number of Kidnappers Awaiting Sentencing</h3>
<p>Detectives Shi Sijian, Bao Shuji, and Xu Yongyuan of the Hongkou Police Station previously arrested a large number of kidnappers, ten men and women, and seized three handguns and 203 rounds of ammunition. It has been found that (1) the defendant Zhuo Hongzhong, on July 5, 1930, colluded with accomplices to kidnap Qiu Guoliang, the owner of a jewelry store near Guangxi Road and Hankou Road. Later, his family redeemed him for 40,000 yuan, and Zhuo received 1,600 yuan. (2) Ma Gengsheng and Zhuo Hongzhong, on May 5 of last year, kidnapped Ma Yifa, the fifteen-year-old son of jeweler Ma Xiangsheng, on Glock Road in the French Concession, and shot and killed the chauffeur Wu Baosheng on the spot. He was later redeemed for 30,000 yuan through Bai Guo. Ma and Zhuo each received 1,400 yuan. (3) Zhu Qingfa, Zhao Yisheng, Zhuo Hongzhong, and Zhu Xu, on December 23 of last year, shot and assassinated Zhu Zizhong, a Ningbo native, at the entrance of Deyu Lane, Dongyouheng Road. (4) The defendants Zhao Yisheng, Zhuo Hongzhong, Liu Yongting, and Zhu Xu were involved in major cases such as the attempted kidnapping of Li Jun, the owner of the Shengtong pawnshop on Haining Road, in March of this year. They have been sent to the First Special District Local Court for several interrogations. All the details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Zehan continued the interrogation in Criminal Court No. 8. The police lawyer stated the previous facts, saying that the victims were still not in court today. The victim Qiu Guoliang went to Hong Kong and has not returned. Only the chauffeur was present. The victim Ma Yifa and his mother went to Hangzhou to live, and their location is unknown. His father, Ma Xiangsheng, is a jeweler and has also gone abroad, only sending a representative lawyer to court. Subsequently, the witness Xu Guisheng turned himself in and testified that he was Qiu Guoliang's chauffeur. One evening, at about one o'clock, the employer finished watching a play at the Grand Theater and went to a certain surname's place in the Xiaohuayuan. After a while, he went outside. Just as he boarded the car, several thugs suddenly came and used handguns to scare and restrain him, ordering him not to speak, otherwise they would immediately shoot and kill him, so he did not dare to resist. He saw two bandits get into the car and monitor the employer's actions. The bandits drove the car to Aerbei Road in the French Concession and drove him out of the car, speeding away towards Xujiahui. After about ten days, the employer returned home, but he did not hear about the ransom payment. Qiu's lawyer also stated that he did not hear about the ransom payment. Then, Ma's representative lawyer stated that Ma Xiangsheng is currently doing business in the United States and does not know about the ransom matter. The defense lawyer for the defendant Bai Guo, Wu Linkun, was absent and was replaced by lawyer Fan Gang. He stated that the victim Ma Xiangsheng must be brought to court to clarify who the 30,000 yuan was given to. He questioned the defendant Zhuo Hongzhong, whose testimony was roughly the same as in the previous court. The defendant Gao Gengsheng denied receiving the money for kidnapping Ma Yifa. The judge, because the victims in this case were difficult to bring to court, ordered the start of the arguments. The police lawyer stated that Ma Yifa is Bai Guo's godson, and the ransom payment should be certain. The defendants Zhuo Hongzhong, Zhao Yisheng, Zhu Qingfa, and Zhu Xu were involved in the assassination of Zhu Zizhong. Because Zhuo and Zhao had previously jointly sold military weapons with Zhu Zizhong, Zhu took all the money for himself, which caused a deep feud. At that time, Zhuo Hongzhong loaded a handgun with bullets and handed it to Zhao Yisheng to carry out the assassination. Moreover, Zhu Xu is Zhu Zizhong's wife, and Zhu Qingfa is his son, so they all knew about it in advance and conspired together. Zhu Zizhong had previously had an affair with another woman and abused his wife and son, causing a love triangle. Questioning Zhu Xu in court, the lawyer asked whether she and Zhu Zizhong were formally husband and wife. She replied that he was actually a lover. Her real husband, Jiang Ruisheng, had died ten years ago, and Qingfa was the son of her previous husband. She firmly stated that she did not know about the conspiracy to murder Zhu Zizhong. Finally, the police lawyer stated that the defendants Liu Yongting, Ye Yongxiang, and Zhu Sifan were being prosecuted for the crime of illegally possessing firearms. The two sides' lawyers argued for a long time. Judge Wu ordered the defendants to be returned to custody separately to await sentencing on a scheduled date.</p>
<h3>Trial Record of Zhang Genbao's Murder Case</h3>
<p>| Sentencing Scheduled for the 19th |</p>
<p>In the Qujiaqiao area of Zhabei, a young man named Zhang Genbao and Xu Rongrong were involved in a love triangle. Last June, Xu Rongrong was shot and killed by Zhang Genbao. His body was abandoned by Zhang's wife, Zhang Tang, and chauffeur Lu Akun. After Xu Cai, the deceased's wife, found the body, she reported it to the Public Security Bureau, who arrested Zhang Tang and Lu Akun and sent them to the local court for questioning. Zhang Tang and others were each sentenced to three months of imprisonment and released long ago. Therefore, Zhang Genbao believed that the matter was over and secretly returned home, resulting in his arrest by detectives and being sent back to the local court, where he was prosecuted for the crime of murder. Yesterday, Judge Yang summoned him for questioning and also summoned Zhang Tang for questioning. However, Zhang Tang said that after her husband had an accident, she fled and was imprisoned. Xu Cai, the deceased's wife, hired workers to take away all the large and small utensils in her home, even the floor. She also wore hemp clothing and climbed onto the roof of Zhang's house to urinate. Such a prank must be cursing his family to be ruined and never recover. All the property should be returned and an investigation should be requested, and she submitted a statement to the court. The judge asked about it briefly and said that this was a separate matter and would be resolved separately. He then asked Zhang Genbao, saying that Xu Rongrong was his friend and they were brothers. However, he was two-faced and raped his wife. On the night of the incident, when he returned home, a friend gave him a handgun. He tucked it into his waistband. He knocked on the door and Xu Rongrong knew about it, so he rushed out and grabbed him, intending to kill him. Unexpectedly, the handgun went off and a bullet was fired, killing Xu. The fact that he only had one gunshot wound is proof of this. Zhang Tang testified that Xu Rongrong's attempted rape was true. They were fighting outside and she did not see it. The deceased's family requested redress, heavy punishment, and compensation for losses and consolation money. After the prosecutor and lawyers debated each other, the judge declared the debate closed. The defendant was returned to custody and sentencing would be on the 19th.</p>

The children's garden section of Huishan Park has started to be expanded. Two hundred new seats have been added to each park, which were made by the Public Works Department's factory. Summer roadside trees are being pruned or cultivated to prevent typhoon attacks.</p>
<p>Under the Supervision of Four Bureaus</p>
<h3>Continued Excavation of Liu Family's Ancient Tomb</h3>
<p>An ancient tomb of the Liu family from the Ming Dynasty, located at No. 100 Wanzhu Street, Jiujiudi, inside the bamboo fence, was previously excavated and a female corpse was found that did not rot, and the coffin was in good condition. This caused ignorant people to scramble to pry off the wood from the coffin and the black water and lime in the pit, claiming that it could cure diseases. The Public Security Bureau, the Social Bureau, and other bureaus learned about this and feared that the ignorant people would be poisoned. They ordered the Liu family to stop the excavation. On one hand, the Social Bureau sealed the unexcavated tomb. Now it is heard that the matter has been resolved. The Public Security Bureau, the Social Bureau, the Education Bureau, and the Health Bureau sent personnel to supervise the Liu family to excavate the ancient tomb. If the excavated coffin is intact, it must not be pried open and the original coffin must be moved to another place for burial. It is said that the excavation started a few days ago.</p>

<p>The Main Culprit in the Assassination of Zhao Tieqiao</p>
<h3>Wang Shuchiao et al. Continued Trial Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau's Request for Transfer Was Not Approved</p>
<p>This Case Still Needs Investigation and Will Be Retried at a Later Date</p>
<p>Zhao Tieqiao, the General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, was assassinated at the entrance of the company on July 24, 1930. Subsequently, the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested the murderers Wang Qinshan (also known as Wang Xiaosanzi) and Xia Shaoren. Recently, the Chinese and Western detectives of the Old Zha Police Department in the Public Concession arrested the main culprits Zhou Zhizhang (also known as Xuan Si) and Niu Anru (i.e., Niu Jinpu), the instigator Wang Shuchiao (currently a lawyer), and the suspects Hong Yaodou, Ge Wenqing, Gong Wenjiang, and six others. The First Special Court has questioned and detained them. This has already been reported in this newspaper. This morning, Qian Hongye, the Chief Judge of the Criminal Division of the First Special Court, opened a criminal court to continue the trial. The defendants Zhou Zhizhang, Ge Wenqing, and Gong Wenjiang hired lawyer Fan Gang, Wang Shuchiao hired lawyers Gao Junxiang and Shen Junru, and Hong Yaodou hired lawyer Cheng Shangfeng for defense. In addition to sending detective team leader Gao Wansheng to court to request a transfer, the Public Security Bureau also appointed a lawyer to court. First, the police lawyer Ru Baozhi stated that the police department</p>
<h3>Ge Wenqing and Gong Wenjiang</h3>
<p>will not prosecute and request their release first. The remaining four, Zhou Zhizhang, Wang Shuchiao, Hong Yaodou, and Niu Anru, are prosecuted for premeditated murder under Article 284 of the Criminal Law. Then, he described the arrest of the defendants and stated that the deceased Zhao Tieqiao lived at No. 4, Lane 163, Luban Road. On the morning of July 24, 1930, Zhao, his wife Wang, and bodyguard Liu Hua went out in car No. 7347. Liu Hua got out of the car first and opened the door. Zhao got out of the car and walked up the stone steps of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company when a gunshot was heard.</p>
<h3>Zhao Fell to the Ground</h3>
<p>Liu Hua was unable to resist because his gun license had not been renewed. At the same time, the bandits fired another shot at Liu, hitting the briefcase he was holding. Fortunately, he was not injured. Liu blew his whistle to summon the police, but the murderers had already escaped. Zhao was taken to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment but died at 12 o'clock that night. Later, the Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested Wang Qinshan and Xia Shaoren and sent them to the Shanghai Local Court for trial. The results are unknown. Among the criminals arrested by the police department, only Zhou Zhizhang and Niu Anru wrote confessions; the others denied. The whereabouts of Zhao's family are unknown, so they could not be present in court. Then, two copies of the confession were submitted to the court. According to Articles 13 and 19 of the Criminal Procedure Law,</p>
<h3>Two Courts Accept the Same Case</h3>
<p>the case should be accepted by the court that accepted it first. Therefore, it is requested that the defendants be transferred. The police lawyer Ru Baozhi immediately expressed his opinion, saying that the Municipal Council could not agree to the Public Security Bureau's request for transfer. According to the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Law, the Shanghai Local Court should be the one to make the request, not the Public Security Bureau, because the court is not subordinate to the Public Security Bureau. Judge Qian Hongye ruled that this case was a related case and that the court could also accept it according to law. Therefore, the Public Security Bureau's request could not be approved, and he proceeded with the trial. He instructed that the</p>
<h3>Defendants Be Questioned Separately</h3>
<p>First, Zhou Zhizhang was brought forward and asked whether the statements in the police confession were what he had said. He replied that it was due to torture. Judge Qian Hongye said that even if it was torture, he still had to state what he had said so that it could be recorded. Then, he announced the contents of the confession, which stated that he (Zhou) had previously served as the captain of the transportation team in the 8th Brigade of the 4th Division of the Zhejiang Army. Hong Yaodou was a judge advocate, so they knew each other. In June 1930, he came to Shanghai and met Hong, who invited him to No. 13, Xiangshun Lane, Caishi Road, French Concession. Through Hong's introduction, he met Wang Yaqiao (Wang Shuchiao's brother, who is also the main culprit in this case). Later, Wang established the Anhui Association and served as the chairman of the Third Congress, with his younger brother Wang Shuchiao as the coach. He and Hong Yaodou also worked in the association. Later, Wang hosted a banquet for him at Hong's house, and Niu Anru and Xia Shaoren were also</p>
<p>present. During the banquet, Wang Yaqiao said that</p>
<h3>To Seek Benefits for the People of Anhui</h3>
<p>he founded the Anhui Association, but there were financial difficulties. He planned to find a way to solve this at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, but due to Zhao Tieqiao's control, there was no way to do so. Therefore, he wanted to find a way to deal with Zhao. Everyone agreed. Later, Wang convened another meeting and designated Wang Shuchiao to find out Zhao Tieqiao's movements. On July 23, Wang said that Zhao's movements had been ascertained and that action would be taken tomorrow. He and five others were assigned to take action. That morning, he and Hong Yaodou, Wang Shuchiao, Xia Shaoren, and Niu Anru each carried five or six guns and waited near the entrance of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company.</p>
<h3>Wang Shuchiao would give the signal</h3>
<p>by raising his hand to shoot at Zhao. At the time, he fired a shot. Afterward, Hong took out 600 yuan, and he took 100 yuan. He was asked whether the above points were what he had confessed to the police. Zhou replied that although it was what he had confessed, it was out of desperation and that there was no such fact. Then, Western Detective Chief White told that the defendants Wang Shuchiao, Hong Yaodou, and Niu Anru were identified by Zhou Zhizhang after their arrest and accompanied the police to the scene of the incident to demonstrate the situation at that time. He also said that after the incident, he fled to Hong Yaodou's house on Fuzhou Road by rickshaw. Niu Anru was then brought to the court and denied everything,</p>
<h3>Completely Denying All Sections in the Confession</h3>
<p>Wang Shuchiao was also brought forward and did not admit to the charges, saying that Wang Yaqiao, although his elder brother, did not associate with him and did not know his residence. In 1931, he was a standing committee member of the Anhui Association, and Wang Yaqiao was a consultant, but they rarely interacted. As for Zhou Zhizhang, because he had not succeeded in borrowing money from him, he had wanted to kidnap him. This time, he was falsely accused. Hong Yaodou testified that he had previously been the Chief of Military Justice in Pang Bingdong's unit, and later served as a staff officer of Fang Zhenwu and the Military Judge of the 8th Brigade of the 4th Division of the Zhejiang Army. When Zhao was killed, Fang's unit had just disbanded, and he was living in Peiping. He knew nothing about the killing of Zhao Tieqiao. Judge Qian ruled that the case still needed to be investigated and adjourned the case for further questioning at a later date.</p>
<p>Nagasaki, Japan</p>
<h3>A Large Batch of Drugs Bound for Shanghai Was Seized</h3>
<p>The Main Culprit, Abe, Has an Organization in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Drugs Bound for Shanghai Are Distributed to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Other Places</p>
<p>丨The Japanese Consulate Is Investigating Abe but Has Not Yet Apprehended Him丨</p>
<p>Recently, Japanese rogues secretly shipped a large number of drugs to Shanghai. Due to the secrecy of the matter, the main culprit was found in Nagasaki. The runaway is being searched for in Shanghai. The situation is as follows:</p>
<h3>Smuggling Drugs</h3>
<p>Recently, a certain country's rogues organized a secret smuggling organization to sell drugs in Shanghai. They secretly shipped the drugs to Shanghai by hiding them in medicines or posing as chemical substances. Many of these shipments have been smuggled into Shanghai. The rogues who handled the shipments had organizations in both Japan and Shanghai, with a tight structure that had not yet been exposed. The person in charge is named Abe. Most of the drugs shipped to Shanghai are distributed to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian.</p>
<h3>Smuggling Busted</h3>
<p>Last time, when the Nagasaki Maru of the Japan Post was sailing from Japan to Shanghai, the Nagasaki Police Department had already heard that a large batch of drugs was being shipped to Shanghai. So, they sent a team to search the ship. As a result, they found more than 40 boxes of medicines, all destined for Shanghai. They were being transported by a Japanese man named Kuwahara Mikichi. The police opened the boxes and found a large amount of morphine mixed in with the medicines, worth an estimated 100,000 yuan or more.</p>
<h3>Goods Seized, Person Detained</h3>
<p>The more than 40 boxes of toxic goods were seized on the spot and stored in the police station. The Japanese man, Kuwahara, who was transporting them, was also detained. After a detailed inquiry, it was learned that the operator of this business was a Japanese man named Abe. The Japanese organization is in Kobe, and the Chinese organization is in Shanghai. This time, because there was a large shipment of morphine bound for Shanghai, Abe first took the Shanghai Maru to Shanghai to wait for the goods. The Japanese Police Department immediately cabled Shanghai to search and arrest the main culprit, Abe.</p>
<h3>Strict Search</h3>
<p>Upon receiving the telegram from the Nagasaki Police Department, the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai immediately sent a large number of Japanese police to conduct a strict search in the Hongkou area for the main culprit Abe. However, after several days of investigation, he has not yet been apprehended.</p>

<p>Free Talk: Excess Knowledge by Yu Ming</p>
<p>The world is experiencing an economic panic because of overproduction. Although more than 30 million workers are starving, food overproduction is still an 'objective reality.' Otherwise, the United States would not lend us wheat flour, and we would not be 'suffering from a bumper harvest.'</p>
<p>However, knowledge can also be overproduced, and when that happens, the panic is even greater. It is said that the more vigorously modern education is promoted in rural areas of China, the faster the rural areas will go bankrupt. This is probably a case of knowledge suffering from a bumper harvest. The United States is plowing up cotton fields because cotton is cheap. China should also plow up knowledge. This is a wonderful method imported from the West.</p>
<p>Westerners are capable. Five or six years ago, Germany was already complaining that there were too many university students. Politicians and educators were urging young people not to go to university. Now, Germany is not only advising against it but also putting the plowing up of knowledge into practice—for example, by setting fire to books, ordering writers to eat their own manuscripts, and putting groups of university students in barracks to do hard labor, which is called 'solving the unemployment problem.' Isn't China also complaining that there are too many liberal arts students? In fact, there are too many secondary school students as well. A 'strict' entrance examination system should be used, like an iron broom, to sweep the majority of knowledgeable young people back to the 'countryside.'</p>
<p>Why does excess knowledge cause panic? Don't 80 or 90 percent of Chinese people still not know how to read? However, excess knowledge is still an 'objective reality,' and the resulting panic is also an 'objective reality.' Too much knowledge either makes people too clever or too soft-hearted. Clever people will overthink things. Soft-hearted people will be reluctant to take drastic measures. As a result, either they themselves will not be calm, or they will prevent others from being calm. Then, disaster will strike. Therefore, knowledge must be plowed up.</p>
<p>However, merely plowing up is not enough. It must be replaced with education that is suitable for practical use. First, there must be instruction in fate: people must be content with their fate. Although fate may be bitter, one should still be happy. Second, there must be instruction in how to 'read the situation': people must know about modern weapons. At the very least, these two types of practically useful knowledge must be promoted quickly. The method of promotion is very simple... An ancient philosopher refuted idealism by saying that if you doubt the existence of the material substance of this bowl of rice, you should eat it and see if it fills you up. Now, if you want to teach people about electricity, it is best to shock them and see if it hurts... If you want to teach people about the effectiveness of airplanes, it is best to fly an airplane over their heads and drop a bomb to see if they die... With this kind of practical education, there will be no more excess knowledge.</p>
<p>Notes on Reading by Little Snow</p>
<p>1.  Classless understanding does not exist. This can be seen not only in the actions and thoughts of people but also in the observation of natural phenomena. The idea that there is no class in technique or beauty in nature is a very conceptual dualism. I can prove it with facts. The famous Soviet director Vsevolod Pudovkin in "A Close-Up of Time" has the following description...</p>
<p>The rain has stopped. Coming out of the house, I was about to walk through the front yard. At this time, a man was handling his scythe, and I stopped to take a close look at him.</p>
<p>The man's upper body was completely unclothed. The muscles on his shoulders shone in the sunlight every time the scythe went up and down. As a result, a dazzling light was reflected at the moment it fell. I walked closer and closer to his side. The raised scythe plunged into the grass filled with raindrops. As a result, the cut grass fell gently to the ground. From the tips of the bright, arched blades of grass, drops of crystal dew fell one by one.</p>
<p>His scythe continued to flash up and down, and I continued to stare at his movements.</p>
<p>To write about labor so beautifully is really not a matter of 'deep observation' but a matter of understanding labor. Flaubert could write so deeply, but he could only find such miracles on a woman's parasol. Turgenev could do this, but he certainly did not acquire these things from being a nobleman enjoying hunting. Even the famous painter Millet could only discover the beauty of religious piety from the 'Evening Prayer' of farmers and the general posture of 'Gleaners' that could be admired. Serious, passionate, great, deep, standing in the position of the laborer, observing the beauty and love of labor, and infinite joy, only a famous director like Pudovkin and only a writer who lives deeply in labor can experience. Classlessness is completely a false statement.</p>
<p>2.  Just as it is in observation, so it is in the description of feelings. A laborer's writer describes the feelings of laborers more deeply and genuinely than writers of other classes. This is of course due to life and due to understanding of laborers. As Ding Ling wrote in "Mother" about the feelings of a farmer...</p>
<p>Although these grains did not belong to him, but to his master, whom he called the old master, who could say that this land, these grains did not belong to him? Only he loved them like his own biological son. He stayed with them day and night. He cultivated them. He stood in them. They immersed his feet with tender, wet mud. Even in his sleep, he did not forget to nourish them. He harvested them and carried them to the old master's warehouse, but the old masters did not love them. When they became rice, boiling in a big pot, emitting an indescribable fragrance, only he would laugh in his heart; or when they were lucky enough to be sold by the master to pay off debts, only he would be so frustrated!</p>
<p>Is this the feeling of a farmer that a general writer can write? Even a writer who is sympathetic to laborers cannot go so deep into the feelings of a farmer. Therefore, if you want to describe laborers truthfully and genuinely, without distorting or daydreaming, first of all, you must understand the lives of laborers.</p>
<p>Friendship by Tang Tao</p>
<p>The great Greek philosopher Aristotle (Aristote) explained friendship as 'two bodies, one soul.' In the Greek nation, friendship occupied a position above all relationships of men and women, without any constraints; as harmonious as water, as passionate as fire, sacrificing all of one's precious possessions to fulfill a friend's needs, was a duty in the minds of every Greek. All those who acknowledge Greek culture must be fascinated by this sincere, pure, tragic, and luminous friendship!</p>
<p>Friendship does not consider gender and has no conditions. It is a need that arises from the heart. Homer's Iliad writes about Achilles setting aside the deep hatred of the commander-in-chief for seizing his wife, and going to avenge a dead friend, with sincere grief, loving his friend more than himself. In English elegies, Shelley's Adonais and Tennyson's In Memoriam are outpouring of blood and tears. Shelley mourned the death of his close friend Keats. In the midst of his mourning, he felt that the dead had merged with nature, the rumbling of thunder, the sound of birds, and everywhere there was music, which was the voice of the dead! He felt that his friend had not died, but had only awakened from a dream of life. So he urged his heart not to hesitate, urging himself to move forward, in the whispers of the breeze, there was the voice of his dead friend, he wished that all that was united by death would not be separated by life. This emotion should not fail to move us! Tennyson mourned the early death of his close friend Hallam, and after a long period of deliberation, he wrote a tragic and poignant masterpiece, every word of which was tears, and every line of which was a flow of affection. In addition, there are many descriptions of friendship. Perhaps because friendship must either be tragic or followed through, it is especially suitable for brave warriors and sensitive men of letters! These affectionate gestures are only done by the 'foreign devils' who are not a 'land of propriety'. In China, apart from the brotherhoods who have sworn oaths, the reading seeds of the so-called 'sages' and 'Confucians' will never easily try. Preparing a bed for a friend is called 'Xu Ru hanging Chen Fan's couch'; listening to a piece of high mountain and flowing water, one cannot help but 'smash the zither of Ya Zhi'; if one recommends a friend to some place, then those who compare themselves to Guan Zhong will have to shout 'Hey, I am Bao Shuya!' Since ancient times, how many people have been able to give their lives for the sake of friendship?</p>
<p>Recent so-called men of letters are even more terrible! They form cliques, regardless of whether they are friends or not, fabricate rumors and slander, and use both open and hidden attacks. Friendship has reached its lowest point today.</p>
<p>Let's Not Talk About This Word "Love" Any More! It is Always Society That Harms People! by Jiang Zhisheng</p>
<p>Now, when people talk about boring men of letters, they think of their ugly faces of self-promotion, rumor-mongering, and betrayal of friends. In fact, this kind of 'ugly face' has a process of evolution, which can be studied as a social phenomenon.</p>
<p>For example, multi-angled love novels. At first, it was because young people were talking wildly about love after the 'May Fourth' movement, and the feudal love of Dream of the Red Chamber did not suit their tastes. So, quick-witted people, after reading Kikuchi Kan's novels, drunkenly and ecstatically, came up with a set of book-stealing methods with a changed face, as 'creations', trying to cater to the tastes of young people. Although the motive at this time was not pure, the face was not very ugly.</p>
<p>The youth's love craze was originally a 'disease of the times.' Didn't the multi-angled love novels originally wear the mask of criticizing the diseases of the times? But after they became 'selling', the temptation of money lifted the mask, and under the consciousness of 'money thirst', they desperately churned out and developed literary masturbation... So the multi-angled love writers became 'manufacturing merchants' of multi-angled love novels. At this time, there was the first stage of the ugly face.</p>
<p>But at this time, the multi-angled love novel manufacturers were still handicraft-style merchants. Although they changed the face of Eastern goods to meet the needs of the market, they still had to put in effort to change the face. They still moved their hands after all. Unfortunately, there is no shortage of sex maniacs in the chaotic society. They demand more and better stimulation of low-level tastes. This 'harmed' people! People only have one pair of hands, and there are only twenty-four hours in a day. Where can they manufacture so much? However, society always arranges a 'way out' for people. Society has a capitalist mode of production that exploits the labor of others. Smart love novel manufacturers have also adopted this system. They bought the works of unknown young people at a low price and resold them under their own name (it should be said as a sign), reaping ten times the surplus profit. So from manufacturers to vendors. The more profits, the uglier the face.</p>
<p>Needless to say, this is also society forcing him to do so. Because the bosses of bookstores don't welcome the products of unknown young people.</p>
<p>But society is a very complex thing. On the one hand, there is no shortage of lustful youth, on the other hand, there are plenty of sober-minded youth; and looking at a model of masturbatory novels too much also makes the lustful feel bored. At this time, even the first-class skilled hands who are both manufacturers and vendors are a little embarrassed. However, society always arranges a 'way out' for them, such as selling themselves to rely on.</p>
<p>This is the last stage of the ugly face, which is now slowly unfolding. And this, it is said, is always society harming people, not people making mistakes! So the truly hateful thing is this social system that harms and corrupts people!</p>

<p>Commercial News: Financial Swap Gold Market Fluctuates</p>
<p>Initially Rising Due to Short Covering, Then Falling Due to Rumors</p>
<p>Swap Prices Vary Narrowly, and Premiums Are Also Normal Yesterday, the gold market experienced swaps, and the market was erratic. People's hearts were initially stable and then tired. Short covering continued fiercely. Initially, British silver rose slightly, but American silver had already seen a decline. Although the exchange rate of British to American dollars increased, the rate of American to British dollars fell. The forward silver price on the Metals Exchange fell by two to four-point-eight cents. Stocks fell slightly, while commodity prices rose. The market opened flat and slightly lower, but due to favorable news reports, people's hearts turned firm. Hengxing immediately bought, and the morning opening was high.

Banks relapsed into their old ways, with slow digestion. The decline was quite rapid. Finally, due to excessive selling, banks took the opportunity to buy at cheap prices, causing the price to rise back to above 80 yuan after the close, fluctuating erratically. Electrolytic copper continued its weakening trend, with an increase of about 210 yuan. The Tianjin source was more active.

<h3>Awards and Closing Ceremony at the Congress 丨Seventeen Gun Salute丨 (Qingdao, 15th dispatch) The congress held its closing ceremony at the stadium at 5:00 PM today. All staff and athletes gathered in front of the East Rostrum. Each unit circled and stood behind their unit flag. Chairman Lei Fazhang first delivered the closing address. Chairman Shen Honglie, Chief Referee Zhang Boling, and representatives from various provinces also delivered speeches in succession. After Chairman Shen presented the awards, a salute was fired, the flag was lowered, and the congress closed. The athletes marched in formation around the stadium for one week, with a solemn atmosphere, a spirit unseen in previous congresses. The team dispersed at dusk, a scene of vastness. Rostrum Scene (Qingdao, 15th dispatch) The closing ceremony was held at 5 PM tonight. The newly erected pine archway exuded a fragrant aroma. Pine branches were hung from the top of the rostrum to the bottom. A total of nine rows of banners, cups, and shields were displayed, with three large flags lined up on both sides. The large silver cup awarded by Shen is a rotating award and is a full five feet in size, as large as the Chiang cup, dazzling and brilliant. The railings on the left and right of the stage were also hung with banners, inscribed with "Sincerity and Unity" and "National Spirit," which were presented to the participating teams. Various people included three foreign guests. Japanese reporters were present to take photographs. Qingdao had the most athletes and the best spirit. Jilin had no one. Shanxi's female athletes all carried floral umbrellas. Shen Honglie wore a Zen robe. Lei Fazhang's speech and awards. Chairman Lei gave a speech, saying that the congress had concluded successfully, everyone's spirits were invigorated, and they were consistent throughout. Thanks to everyone's joint efforts this time, he hoped that there would be even greater progress in future events held in other places. He represented the organizing committee in expressing gratitude to all parties for their encouragement and apologized for any inadequacies. It was very good and showed the spirit of North China sports. Eight national records and twelve North China records were broken. The goal of sports is not just to win, but to achieve progress. None of the athletes were sick this time, which shows they were well-trained. Yesterday, a female student fainted after entering the water at the swimming venue, but after being rescued, she continued to swim, which was considered commendable. The association has a lot of responsibility from the 18th to the indefinite term, and hopes to work hard. Although the results have improved, they are still far from the Far East and the world. If the country wants to have a place, it depends on everyone's efforts. He plans to invite everyone to swim tomorrow for a small gathering and farewell, which is inevitably reluctant. Fortunately, there are still many opportunities to learn from each other in the 19th and 20th sessions, and each of us should strive for the country. He wished everyone good health. Chen Baoquan's Speech. Chen Baoquan, representing Hebei, gave a speech, saying that Shen's preparations were thorough and the results were satisfactory and admirable. The Qingdao stadium is magnificent and difficult to surpass. Next year's congress will be held in Hebei. He hoped that everyone would combine their spirits and make further progress. More records should be broken at the 18th session. However, he cannot say beautiful words to Qingdao City, but he will do his best. Zhang Boquan's Speech. Chief Referee Zhang gave a speech, saying that this session broke more than ten North China and national records, achieving the goal of raising the standard. Although there were some disputes, many units showed the spirit of benevolence and chivalry and resolved them immediately. Technical and moral standards have both improved, and he hoped for even greater efforts. Athlete's Response. Athlete representative Yang Xuexian from Shandong replied that the authorities and mayor expect us to work hard to live up to their expectations. The value of the award does not lie in the size of the prize, but in the spirit of those who receive and cherish it. In addition, there are two pessimistic points: representatives from Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang have difficulty returning home, and no one from Rehe came to the congress. At this time, there is little enthusiasm in our hearts. We should work hard for the lost territories. This is everyone's responsibility. We should endure hardship and live this superior life. The authorities are encouraging us, but those who receive it feel ashamed. There is no way to thank Qingdao for promoting sports. Please shout "Long live Qingdao" three times. Gun Salute and Closing Ceremony. After the speeches, the athletes cheered enthusiastically. Photos were taken and awards were presented. At 6:30 PM, the flag was lowered, a 17-gun salute was fired, and the ceremony was completed. The athletes lined up and guided the award-winning athletes out of the stadium. Closing ceremony. Davis Cup European Zone Final: Britain Eliminates Australia British to play the U.S. in inter-zonal final (Reuters, London, 15th dispatch) In the Davis Cup European Zone final, Britain led 2-1 after the first two days.

<p>Silk and Tea</p>
<p>Silk and Tea. New silk from Shandong factories is being shipped to Shanghai continuously.</p>
<h3>New Summer Cocoons from Hangzhou and Shaoxing Have Been Shipped</h3>
<p>The new summer cocoons that Shanghai silk cocoon merchants collected in the Hangzhou and Shaoxing areas have all been dried and shipped to Shanghai in batches. The total amount shipped is estimated to be over 2,000 dan.</p>
<h3>Eighty Boxes of New Silk from Shandong Have Arrived</h3>
<p>Shandong had a bumper harvest of spring cocoons. Factories in Zhoucun and Linqu have resumed operations one after another. Silk production is increasing daily. New silk from Shandong factories is being shipped to Shanghai continuously. The Yanqing, Banpu, and Anlun ships have delivered eighty boxes in recent days.</p>
<h3>Xunzhen Gang is Starting to Trade Artificial Silk</h3>
<p>Yesterday, artificial silk in this port was being started again due to Xunzhen Gang. A total of 46 boxes of the current July goods of Deji First and Second brands, Shuang Liuhai, etc., were traded at prices ranging from 180 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen to 161 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen net.</p>
<h3>English Sales of Black Tea from Hubei and Hunan Have Started</h3>
<p>Recently, the market for black tea in Hankou has not been quiet, because the prices of Indian and Ceylon tea in the English market are both high, and the prices of black teas from Hubei and Hunan are more affordable. English merchants are going to the area to buy, seemingly more than in previous years. Yesterday, the Jinlong and Tianxiang English firms in this city also started buying. A total of over 200 boxes were traded in the city. Yichang Gaozhuang goods opened at 115 yuan, and Anhua goods opened at 42 yuan. As for the green tea market, generally needle tea is the best seller. Due to the sharp rise in exchange rates, demand from abroad has slowed slightly, so most traders are taking a wait-and-see attitude. The price of 300 yuan for Zhenmei tea from outside the customs is almost completely ignored.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<h3>He Xia Rice Suffers a Setback</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were over 40 sources. Both wholesale and retail sales were acceptable, but due to wavering confidence, the situation weakened, and the market inevitably softened. The prices of thick japonica rice from Changbang, Sutongbang, and Nangang, as well as Duyang tip, fell by several fen to a jiao. Although Qingjiao, Songjiang thin paddy rice, and Jinbang were still trading 2,000 bales, the market was also weak by several fen. The price of Bianyin Yuan, due to a lack of goods, was still strong.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were only about ten sources from various He Xia gangs. Sales of various types on the market were normal. White rice was stable at the top end, slightly tighter at the middle and lower ends. The price of Bian Yuan was tight by several fen. Thin paddy rice was stable at the top end and soft at the lower end. The prices of early rice, Dujian, and Kejian were all stable. The remaining goods were similar to before.</p>
<h3>Forward Flour Fluctuates Rapidly</h3>
<p>The price of foreign wheat was good in the previous market and rose. After factory sales surged, the market was low. After the flour market opened yesterday morning, prices for all months showed an upward trend. Because the quotation for foreign wheat rose by about 7, 8, 9 jiao to one yuan, after the opening price, confidence was good again, and buying for all months was very strong. Outside speculators also frequently bought in. However, the major factories were gradually selling short both near and distant months, especially Maoxin, which caused the market to show a slight weakness amidst strength. When the market opened in the afternoon, the market suddenly declined again, because the factory's sales were still surging and the sales of spot flour were also at flat prices. It was reported that the price of goods from Tanggu of Bingchuan was 2 yuan 3 jiao 9 fen, and the price of goods from the fort opened at 2 yuan 3 jiao 6 fen, about 30,000 bales, so near and distant months fell again. Looking at the future trend, because actual sales are normal, there is probably no hope for excessive gains. As a result, July and August rose by only a small amount, 2 li and 5 hao. September rose by 5 li. October was unchanged. November rose by 5 li. December was unchanged.</p>
<h3>The Forward Wheat Market Turns from Bullish to Bearish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the forward wheat market opened in the morning, prices for all months showed a consistent upward trend. The quotation for foreign wheat continued to rise by 7, 8, 9 jiao to one yuan. The price of inland wheat was intentionally raised by both traders and factories. Therefore, confidence became good, reversing the trend from the previous day, with gains of about 3, 5, and 7 fen. When the market opened in the afternoon, it was initially stable. Later, due to the decline in the flour market, coupled with reports that the international economic problems were in a state of stagnation, the import of wheat in the future was unavoidable. Therefore, confidence returned to normal. As a result, only the current month was slightly better by 1 fen. August and September were better by 2 fen. October and November were better by 4 fen. December was better by 2 fen. In the spot wheat market, the middle grade was still flat. The opening prices for high-grade goods seemed to be better by 3 to 5 fen, but because the factory capacity was limited, excessive increases would probably stop again. Yaowan wheat opened at 3 yuan 8 jiao 5 fen, Bao Ying wheat at 3 yuan 6 jiao 8 fen, the lower grade at 6 jiao 3 fen, Liuhe wheat at 3 yuan 6 jiao 2 fen, the lower grade at 5 jiao 7 fen, Danyang wheat at 3 yuan 6 jiao 5 fen, Hezhou wheat at 3 yuan 4 jiao 3 fen, Nanjing wheat at 3 yuan 3 jiao 8 fen, Chongming wheat at 3 yuan 4 jiao 7 fen, and the lower grade at 3 jiao 6 fen, totaling 3,100 bales.</p>
<h3>Hankou Beans Suppress Train Beans</h3>
<p>This year, the harvest of new beans is abundant everywhere, and Chen beans from various sources have a tendency to be sold off. Recently, about 20,000 beans from Xinyangzhou in Hankou have been transported by land, but they have not been sold because the selling price does not match. New goods are gradually entering the market. Yesterday, the merchants reluctantly sold off 6 to 7,000 bales at a price of 4 yuan and 8 jiao, which was purchased by factories and car dealers. Yesterday, Zhengyangguan beans were forced up to 4 yuan and 9 jiao and 5 fen.</p>
<h3>The Oil Market, High Quality Tung Oil, Later Arrivals Are Uncertain</h3>
<p>The price of high quality tung oil returns to the customer price agreed upon in Hankou. The Hankou oil firms then re-wholesale to Shanghai firms. In the past two or three years, high, medium, and lower grades from the production area have been sold directly to the Shanghai firms by customers, except for the high grades, which were still handled by Hankou. This is also a change in the market. At the turn of spring and summer this year, a batch of high quality goods arrived. Later, they were sold as soon as they arrived. Another batch arrived last month. The total number of each grade was about 1,000 to 2,000 barrels. The price was 21 taels for Tip Show Wan, Yu, Dayou Heng, and the price was 20 taels and 4 qian for Tip Medium Zhen Tai, Jifeng Heng, and the Shanghai delivery price was a profit. The next shipment was slightly smaller, with a premium of one tael. The current spot prices were 30 yuan and 8 jiao for high quality, 30 yuan for high medium quality, and 28 yuan and 8 jiao for medium quality. The customer goods are already sold out. It is reported that the number of later arrivals is not many, and it is impossible to determine whether they will arrive continuously without interruption, so the selling price of the current goods held by each firm is very tight.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Prisoner Rations</h3>
<p>— Yang Yusheng</p>
<p>There are several types of people for whom the state should be responsible for feeding. Soldiers, on whom internal security and external defense depend, should receive military rations. Disaster victims, whose calamities result from inadequate state protection, should receive relief rations. Prisoners, whose cases may be pending review, should not be deprived of their means of survival and should receive prisoner rations.</p>
<p>There are several types of people who profit from soldiers, disaster victims, and prisoners. Military officers embezzle military rations. False philanthropists embezzle relief rations. Prison officials embezzle prisoner rations. Though the names differ, the “caterpillars” are the same.</p>
<p>Reportedly, the Soviet Union has made extraordinary improvements to prison facilities and treatment in its Five-Year Plan. Some idle individuals deliberately commit minor offenses to enjoy prisoner rations. China, despite its large unemployed population, has not reached that level of idleness. Perhaps it is because Chinese prisons lack the refinement of Soviet ones, and prisoner rations are often embezzled by prison officials, making people hesitant to try such a thing.</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Yat-sen once said, “Chinese people only experience great poverty and small poverty…” This saying is full of thought-provoking philosophy. We often see officials who like to put on a show, and the bigger the show, the deeper the debt. Once burdened with debt, they have no choice but to engage in corruption and wrongdoing. Though the position of prison warden is small, it is still an official position, so a certain level of grandeur is expected. Western-style houses, cars… these are all necessary displays. Putting on a show costs money, and even if one’s family is wealthy and one dislikes such displays, one still needs to make some money for the sake of one's children and grandchildren. Thus, they prey on prisoners, embezzling or inflating prisoner rations. Though the methods are said to be deplorable, when one thinks of the current display or the future of one's children and grandchildren, one cannot afford to worry too much.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate to be born a human, even more unfortunate to be born a Chinese person, and most unfortunate to be a prisoner in a Chinese prison. Imagine, the daily prisoner rations of three meals a day, weighed with “scales” and distributed in portions, are already so deplorable, yet there are still those who embezzle or inflate them. Prisoners bear the name, while prison officials reap the benefits. The darkness of prison life can be imagined!</p>
<p>I believe that embezzling or inflating prisoner rations is a trivial issue, hardly worth noting. But the fact that every prison official embezzles or inflates prisoner rations is a serious problem. Knowing that embezzling or inflating prisoner rations is illegal, before becoming a prison official, one might use this to tear down others. But after becoming a prison official, embezzlement or inflation is doubled compared to others. All officialdoms, military officers, are the same. It is as if there is fundamentally no solution in China!</p>
<h3>Timely Essays</h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>Poets and writers, “singing of spring,” “praising summer,” “lamenting autumn,” “mourning winter,” throughout the four seasons, write endless “new poems” and praise countless “fine sentences,” just like the “big sales” in department stores, always timed to coincide with the seasons. Even when the lunar calendar becomes the “abolished calendar” and the solar calendar becomes the “national calendar,” they never miss a “seasonal big sale” in spring. At any time and any scene, they can always “find inspiration on all sides” and “be exactly right.”</p>
<p>It’s strange, this skill has now been learned by us freelancers. In winter, you write an essay on “the fierce north wind” and I write an essay on “pure white snow.” In spring, you write an essay on “the charming peach blossoms” and I write an essay on “the gentle willows.” Now, the “Summer Big Sale” signs are plastered on the large glass windows in the shopfronts, and the sounds of “Cold drinks! Selling ice!” can be heard in the alleys. Thus, the newspaper supplements are filled with essays on “flies” and articles on “bedbugs.”</p>
<p>In Shanghai, the croaking of frogs can never be heard, and the buzzing of mosquitoes is because the “Yangjing Creek” and “City River Creek” have… one must go outside the city to find mosquitoes. So in Shanghai, it can be said that “buzzing has become a thing of the past.” Besides that, “yellow dogs dragging their tongues” and “bare chests climbing counters” are considered too crude. “Park Sketches,” “Swimming Sketches,” “Cooling on the Rooftop,” “Escaping the Heat in the Alleys,” “Electric Fans,” “Ice Cream,” are indeed “on-the-spot wonders,” but they are too common, like seeing “foreign warships” in the Huangpu River: one horizontal, one vertical, oh, and another one. Even the flies next to the trash can and the bedbugs in the seams of the mat feel nothing more than that; they are not very poetic.</p>
<p>But, the opposite also must be said. Poets and writers write “on-the-spot poems” throughout the four seasons. After writing about all four seasons this year, they “capture the scene” again next year. After ten years, they are still writing “on-the-spot poems.” The writers don’t find it boring, and the readers don’t find it tiresome. Just like how the “big sales” in department stores are always jam-packed, with sellers smiling and buyers scrambling. Then, we writers, using ordinary pens, write about ordinary summer scenes that are “the same for ten years,” and we are truly “in our element.”</p>
<p>This is truly a year for “talking about romance and scenery.” Everyone, talk to your heart’s content.</p>
<h3>Worse Than a Dog</h3>
<p>— Fei Wenbao</p>
<p>The death of the Hollywood dog star Rin Tin Tin spread around the world. But the disappearance of the Chinese female writer Ding Ling has lasted more than a month. Her life or death is unknown. The public pays very little attention. Rin Tin Tin was a dog. Ding Ling is a person. It can be said that a person is worse than a dog. The ancient poem, “I would rather be a dog in peaceful times than a human in chaotic times” is true. A guest compared Rin Tin Tin and Ding Ling, calling one a “top strange dog” and the other a “top strange person,” and asked me to write a parallel couplet. I thought hard for a day and could not answer. (Response pending)</p>
<h3>Four Northeast Company Commanders</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 11: Bowing in Agreement to Marriage, Affectionate Feelings</p>
<p>Caring for Soldiers, Joyful Atmosphere</p>
<p>Qing said it was a joke, it wasn’t a joke, I don’t need to say it, you can think about it. Zhao Ziqiang laughed and said… It might not be easy to get leave on this day. Tian Qing laughed and said… You just mentioned the first sentence and you already want to get married, isn’t that a little too fast? Zhao Ziqiang put the letter into his pocket, shrugged his shoulders and said… That’s not what I meant. I… I… He shook his head while laughing and said… What was I saying? I forgot what I was saying. Tian Qing laughed and said… I don’t care what you say, but me showing you the letter is already a great favor, why are you putting it into your pocket? Zhao Ziqiang laughed and said… I was talking and unconsciously put the letter into my pocket. What would I do with your letter? Here, take it. He said, stuffing the letter into Tian Qing’s clothes. Tian Qing laughed and said… You don’t need to ask for leave, but tomorrow you should go home and see when the engagement should be. Zhao Ziqiang said… The battalion commander said not to leave these two days, in case something comes up. If I leave, it would seem like I’m deliberately disobeying orders, and that wouldn’t be good. Tian Qing said… If that’s the case, you should go home for a quick trip today and come back soon, I don’t think anything will happen this afternoon. Zhao Ziqiang said… It’s almost one o’clock now, if I run home and back, I’m afraid I’ll miss the 2 to 4 exercise. At six o’clock it’s my turn to lecture on the regulations. Tian Qing laughed and said… It’s just a coincidence that you’re so busy today. I have to go write a reply, then go to the exercise. Tian Qing left laughing. Zhao Ziqiang fell onto the thin board bed, the bed creaked, he didn’t care, he put his feet up and shook them, looking at the ceiling, thinking, this is really uncertain, that old maid is actually willing to marry me. In Beijing, of course you can’t say she’s very pretty, but in Haidian she’s top talent. Her jet-black hair, her smooth round arms, and… no need to think about it all, all good. (131)</p>
<p>###湯玉麟's Rascality</p>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>The insane Tang Yulin, rejected by the puppet army for collaborating with the enemy, recently led over two thousand men, along with his younger brother Yu Ming, in engaging in banditry between Duolun and Guyuan. They extorted and plundered, committing all sorts of crimes. Even killing him would not atone for his sins. A guest who knows about his past incidents said that Tang liked to associate with thugs when he was young, and his rascality was extraordinary. One day, he made a bet with a thug about being able to go to a small restaurant and get a full meal without spending a penny. The thug wanted to see his skills, so they went to the small restaurant together and sat at separate tables, pretending not to know each other. Tang ordered dishes and ate heartily. After a while, he suddenly stood up and asked the shopkeeper to borrow a wine cup, saying he wanted to go to a nearby tavern to get some wine. The shopkeeper thought it was normal to want to drink with food and did not suspect anything. Unexpectedly, he disappeared without a trace, leaving the bill unpaid and losing a wine cup. The thug was amazed and treated him to a drink to celebrate. When Tang was in Rehe, many treasures were taken from the palace. One was a white jade tea tray, completely pure white without any patterns. However, when water was poured on it, faint images of three or four beautiful women bathing by a stream would appear. There was also an agate paperweight, with a vibrant green grasshopper perched on it, and hundreds or thousands of ants attached to it. The carving was so exquisite that it seemed like the work of ghosts and gods. Tang planned to offer it to the Japanese, but unexpectedly his concubine stole it and ran away. Ill-gotten gains never prosper, as is often the case.</p>
<h3>Twilight Shrouds the Earth</h3>
<p>— Tu Hongxia</p>
<p>At this moment, twilight has already shrouded the earth. In the city...</p>
<p>The leisure class, enjoying themselves, has just risen from their warm beds, finished their breakfast. The women, with painted faces, bright red lips, and wavy hair, dressed in fashionable clothes, lean languidly in the arms of men, in pairs, entering cinemas, dance halls.</p>
<p>In another corner...many who sell their bodies and souls, having finished a full twelve hours of work, dragging their tired bodies, their spirits depleted, slowly trudging home, hoping to gain some comfort, like a prisoner receiving amnesty, but as soon as they enter the door, their wife asks, "What's wrong? The salary hasn't been paid yet, the landlord has already come several times, the rice shop has already warned us today that they will definitely not give us credit tomorrow..."</p>
<p>...Before the wife could finish speaking, their nine-year-old son jumped in, "Dad, the airplane donation at school is due again tomorrow. If I don't pay, the classmates will laugh at me..." Saying this, his small eyes turned red pitifully, two eyeballs full of tears, constantly moving. He heard this, sighed, and finally couldn't say a word. At this moment, twilight has already shrouded the earth.</p>
<p>In the countryside...</p>
<p>Smoke from the chimneys of the houses drifts in the sky with the gentle breeze, the farmers in the fields, the shepherd children, heading home, the women busy cooking, the children laughing, jumping, on the vast grasslands, the melodious mountain songs, mixed with the cawing of returning crows, an inexplicable joy, fills the earth.</p>
<p>In another corner, grain collectors as fierce as tigers, are pressing for payments. In the economically bankrupt countryside, although it is not a famine year, grain is cheaper than anything. It is not enough to repay debts and survive. What to do? Cries of pleading, fierce shouts, shake the surroundings.</p>
<p>Corrections. In yesterday's publication of "Travel Notes of the World Exposition", the last fifteen lines should be placed in the front row. We urgently correct this.</p>

<p>An Easy Life Special - Erwen</p>
<h3>A Life Against Evolution and Creation</h3>
<p>— Pu</p>
<p>Before continuing to discuss the principles assumed by the four systems when we published this special issue on a life of ease, I would like to say a few words to the readers: (1) The daily life of wealthy families in Shanghai (the content of the previous issue); (2) The activities of wealthy families in various places (the content of this issue); (3) Wealthy families' weddings, funerals, and celebrations; (4) Wealthy families' entertainment life (to be published in the following two issues, and submissions are welcome).</p>
<p>Whether people who live a life of ease can obtain true happiness in life was briefly answered in the previous issue's casual discussion. What we want to discuss today is the principle of human evolution and mutual assistance in creation.</p>
<p>The history of human evolution is nothing more than overcoming the pain of nature and eliminating human oppression. According to the psychological analysis of most people, the purpose of life can be said to be nothing more than ease and comfort, but since the beginning of human history, humans have been constantly oppressed by the interaction of natural disasters and human misfortunes. Therefore, human history is also a continuous process of evolution and creation, heading towards the ideal future of ease and comfort. Some people may ask, will this so-called ideal world of ease and comfort always be a utopia for mankind? We believe that this can be proven by facts. We now often refer to European and American countries as advanced countries. What exactly are they advanced in? In short, it is the prosperity of science and the progress of political systems. Therefore, the natural pain and human oppression they suffer are becoming less and less than those suffered by us Chinese people. The most advanced is the current Soviet Russia, which was able to jump from an extremely autocratic Tsarist political system to a super-constitutional socialist ideal system, fully utilizing science to overcome various domestic natural and human difficulties. Looking back at the situation in China, it seems to be exactly the opposite. Water disasters and droughts are increasing, and human oppression (foreign troubles and internal unrest) is becoming increasingly serious. In this dual painful environment, many people who enjoy a life of ease are embracing the idea of ​​"getting by" and living a life of complacency, a life of drunkenness and death. The result and impact of this life, if small, will hinder the process of evolution and creation.</p>
<p>If it is large, it will be enough to promote the danger of national subjugation and racial extinction.</p>
<p>Humans exist on the principle of evolution, and the purpose of creation and mutual assistance is to improve the current situation of natural disasters and human misfortunes. Those who enjoy a life of ease fundamentally lose the spirit of creation and the awareness of mutual assistance. Therefore, this life is not a truly happy life, but rather a life against evolution and creation.</p>

<h3>Beauties Like Flowers, Servants Like Clouds</h3>
<p>— Tu Xunru</p>
<p>The Wealthy in Guangdong</p>
<p>Qing X Garden, the mansion of the Qing X family, a prominent family in X City, Guangdong, can definitely be called a haven of comfort! We have a common saying in Guangzhou: "Xiguan is not as good as Long in Daliang." This saying means that the wealth of the entire Xiguan district cannot catch up with that of the Long family in Daliang. Guangzhou's Xiguan is the wealthiest area, where most of the rich reside. Is it not shocking to describe the Long family with such words? In the Long clan, the Qing X Garden family is exceptionally wealthy, even surpassing the family fortune of Long Jianzhang, Yuan Shikai's favorite minister, a first-class baron during the Hongxian era, who seized a lot of land while serving as the provincial inspector of Guizhou. His wealth is indeed a bit astonishing, and naturally some people will covet it. Although "the doors are high and the dogs are big," making it difficult for bandits to invade, he is still "rich and timid," and somewhat distrustful of the local government, fearing insufficient protection, which would be terrible. Moreover, the greenwood friends (bandits) of Shunde are also among the best in Guangdong Province. Therefore, he took "red-haired" nationality (referring to British nationality obtained in Hong Kong or Macau).</p>
<p>The owner of Qing X Garden is very clever. He built many large buildings in Macau. As long as there is a bit of "wind" (warning), he will choose the best of the thirty-six strategies and escape. Even the cunning rabbit prepares three burrows, let alone a human!</p>
<p>He forever lives a life of intoxication in the land of tenderness (among women). He has eight or nine concubines, who are all once-popular "pipa girls" (similar to the Shanghai "changshan" - high class prostitutes) from Dongdi, Chentangnan, or Shektongtsui. It is not easy to "bring them home" (meaning to hide beauties in a golden house) from the "brothel fortress," and it will always take thousands or tens of thousands of silver dollars!</p>
<p>Qing X Garden runs through XX Li and XX Road. In addition to the garden, there are also four or five connected houses dedicated to Buddhism. Before the 1911 Revolution, there were large black-lettered golden plaques hanging on the door, reading "Gongfang Residence" (Imperial Academy Residence) and "Taishi Residence" (Grand Tutor Residence), truly majestic.</p>
<p>Qing X Garden employs dozens of servants, including male accountants, secretaries, attendants (bodyguards), doormen (gatekeepers), older male servants, younger male servants, gardeners, chefs, night watchmen; and female personal maids (comb mistresses), general helpers (housekeepers), cooks, needle-mommas (seamstresses skilled in embroidery), young maids (unmarried maids), maids (female servants), dry carers (those who serve children), wet carers (wet nurses), everything that you could want. It truly is "one call from above, a hundred responses below," and the whole family lives a life of pampering and comfort. They always traveled by sedan. Before, they had private human-drawn large sedans and tall, spirited horses. Now, maybe they've switched to</p>

<p>automobiles. I heard that our hometown is very Westernized and has opened many roads. This is the time for the "wealthy old men" to show off!</p>
<p>The maternal grandfather of the owner of Qing X Garden, Li XX, the top scholar who was highly regarded, once wrote a plaque for his sister, titled "An Le Wo" (Haven of Comfort). I suddenly remembered it and happened to be the time for the publication of the "An Le Wo Life Special Issue" of the Amateur Weekly, so I wrote it out for him.</p>
<p>Their wealth is truly "impossible to describe with words," but I am a poor man and do not have much free time to write his biography, so I will not go into detail. In short, they are occupying the most superior life that people ask about, and this life is unearned!</p>
<h3>Castle of a Feudal Lord</h3>
<p>— Tantian</p>
<p>The Wealthy in Sichuan</p>
<p>Sichuan, mysterious, demon-filled Sichuan, also has its havens of comfort. These havens of comfort are built on the bodies of impoverished people who have exhausted their blood and sweat; they are built on the pre-collection of grain taxes up to the 60th year of the Republic (1971); they are built on the forced cultivation and consumption of opium in order to extract taxes from it; they are built on the remains of the endless mutual plundering by large and small warlords. In short, the walls of the havens of comfort are made of withered bones, the decorations of the havens of comfort are painted with fresh blood, and their owners are a group of warlords and newly rich.</p>
<p>In Chongqing, you can see Western-style houses stretching for more than ten li along the Zengjiayan area outside Tongyuanmen. Former rural areas have now been demarcated as private residences for army commanders and division commanders, serving as official residences in Sichuan. The roads are built by tunneling through the mountains, winding up and down the slopes to accommodate the mansions of the great men. It is said that building ten li of roads on a mountain made entirely of stone costs more than 2 million yuan. There are constantly guards of army commanders and division commanders on the roads, and two cars must be parked at the entrance of each mansion. The only cars in the vast city of Chongqing, apart from those used by the great men, are those that are privately owned or used for commercial purposes. A certain division commander has a tennis court built, reportedly by American technicians, at a cost of more than 100,000 yuan. Each mansion is equipped with a tennis court, and even a soccer field, a music hall, and a foreign musician with a monthly salary of 3,000 yuan teaching the great men's sons, daughters, and wives to sing in the music hall, as well as dancers with monthly salaries of several thousand yuan teaching them to dance, so there is also a large and magnificent dance hall. In addition, there are swimming pools, gardens, radio stations, and small theaters and cinemas. This arrangement is similar to the castles of feudal lords in medieval Europe. Regardless of the fact that famine victims are everywhere near Chongqing, and that they are surrounded by dirty and decaying slums, as long as you stroll once along the road outside Tongyuanmen, the music and singing that leak out from the high-rise buildings of the mansions are enough for you to enjoy. Therefore, this road has also become a park for ordinary people, and every afternoon, thousands of people come to enjoy the leftovers of the great men.</p>
<p>Although it is an inconvenient place to travel, where the poor still have to climb mountains on foot and carry things on their shoulders, the great men come and go without a trace, fleeting like clouds. The road network is spread throughout the defense areas of a certain system of soldiers, and the roads are specially for the great men to take rides in. The poor can only breathe in the dust and oil fumes left behind by the cars. In the poor mountains, you can sometimes hear the rumbling sound of airplanes, which attracts ordinary people to come out and watch like primitive people. Sitting in the airplane are the army commanders, division commanders, or their wives, either commanding the army to fight in civil wars, or inspecting, or traveling.</p>
<p>The luxuries enjoyed by the great men are innumerable. A concubine is an essential item for every officer above the rank of company commander. If you reach the rank of company commander without a concubine, your colleagues will scold you for being stingy and unstylish. The more concubines, the better. For example, a certain army commander has dozens of them, and kills or shoots them at any time if he is unhappy. Every military officer, even down to the rank of company or regimental commander, must appoint or concurrently hold an important position in the local educational institution, because in this way he can take the opportunity to select concubines as much as possible. If there are beautiful women among the people who dare to hide themselves privately, they will commit a capital crime. For example, a certain regimental commander of a certain unit in Chengdu often leads his guards to women's schools or private homes to "hunt for beauty," which is clear evidence.</p>
<p>With a large number of concubines, it is necessary to have various pastimes and entertainment to enjoy with them. Dancing, singing, and promiscuous pleasures are a given, as are playing cards and smoking opium. Accompanied by concubines or prostitutes, the great men play mahjong or cards (unique to Sichuan), with winnings and losses of up to 100,000 or 80,000 each time. The great men's mahjong playing is equivalent to three meals a day and is never absent. Sichuan produces a lot of opium, and most of the great men and the newly rich smoke it, with some smoking up to four or eight ounces a day. The devices for smoking opium and the servants or women who help prepare the opium are all readily available. If guests are not entertained with the best opium, it is considered an offense to the guests.</p>
<p>The army commanders are tired of the dilapidated rural areas and tired of the ugly and messy cities. They decorate the cities. The first is the bright roads, and the second is the removal of the high and low, long and short thatched houses and dilapidated houses that are not aesthetically pleasing. They cut them into rows of streets, build parks, and build their camps, restaurants, and theaters near the parks. In order to promote art and sports, but in reality to entertain and select concubines, they often hold dance parties, swimming parties, and sports meetings. For example, a certain army commander in northern Sichuan must bring the girls' schools in his defense area to entertain himself once a year, which is evidence.</p>
<p>The details of the haven of comfort are endless and cannot be written completely. What can be written is only those large and obvious things, but the true details are only known to them themselves. However, the foundation on which the haven of comfort is built is collapsing, decaying, and cannot be loaded anymore, so the haven of comfort is also shaking, although they are still struggling desperately.</p>
<h3>The Local Emperor</h3>
<p>— Zuo Yun</p>
<p>The Wealthy in Anhui</p>
<p>If we stand on the city gate tower and look into this city - XX County, Anhui - a gray-black expanse of houses, as short as anchovies, spreads all over the ground in this city. Only one place stands out from this entire scene. It is so tall and grand, the roof ridges of two rows of seven-room houses display an arrogant air, as if boasting to its surroundings: "None of you can match my greatness!"</p>
<p>Mentioning the owner of this house makes the old folks in this city frightened. Because his grandfather was a governor in the Qing Dynasty, and his father was also the garrison commander of a certain key pass in the Republic of China, people said that his family had produced prominent officials for generations. When it came to the owner of this house, because he did not like to go out and become an official, he preferred to be a leisurely gentleman in this city, preparing to spend his old age at home, so some people flattered him as an extraordinary figure who understood reason and sentiment. But little did they know that his gentlemanly life was just as capable of extorting wealth from the people. What difference was there in nature between the extortions in this county and the extortions in other provinces and counties? Moreover, in this so-called "rights of the people" era, the common people were still the masters of the officials, so he could often carry the banner of his master to cover up his fraudulent activities. Thus, his life was always fulfilling.</p>
<p>His wife was a gentle woman with old-fashioned morals, adhering to a non-interference policy regarding her husband's desires. So he fearlessly took three concubines, placing them in this vast house without feeling crowded at all. Naturally, he smoked a lot of opium. He sometimes used the degree of opium smoking as a criterion for appreciating his concubines. Because he felt satisfied only when he was accompanied and served by women when he smoked.</p>
<p>His time, apart from smoking opium and sleeping, was spent going to the yamen (government office) to talk, or accompanying local officials in pastimes such as gambling and drinking, which was the true task of the gentleman class.</p>
<p>The cook Zhao Si loved to hear the report: "Dinner is served! The master is not at home, he has gone to the yamen for dinner." This way, he did not have to worry; because this gentleman was very particular about the taste of his food, and if the dishes were not to his liking, he would even smash the plates on the ground.</p>
<p>In addition to his daily pleasant life, this gentleman also had two special hobbies:</p>
<p>The first is to show off, which can also be said to be one of his ways of extorting wealth. That is, he has a public personality and starts charitable activities. This gentleman must seize the leadership of this no matter what. Otherwise, he would pick on people's faults and criticize their mistakes until the purpose of transferring the leadership to him was achieved. Naturally, a group of flattering friends would come to praise his enthusiasm, but in reality, it was not the case at all.</p>
<p>Another is to cultivate the body. Although the spirit of an opium smoker is always weak and sluggish, he has many supplements to nourish him. In summer, young chicken is a regular evening snack, and in winter, slow-cooked mutton and fresh beef juice are evening snacks. Other tonics such as bird's nest and white lotus, cod liver oil and red tonic pills, are even richly stocked and can be taken at any time. Therefore, his complexion is always fair and tender, and his body is always fat and strong. The title of "opium ghost" is only occupied by those who smoke opium.</p>
<p>This gentleman has wealth, power, and a very healthy body, so his prestige in this city always disturbs people. But the poor people always work hard with resentment in their hearts, sometimes only complaining about their fate!</p>
<h3>Grandmother Liu's Visit to Paradise</h3>
<p>— Quiet Contemplation</p>
<p>A wealthy family in the Shanghai suburbs</p>
<p>In a season of clear autumn skies and blooming chrysanthemums, I seemed fortunate to step into a paradise on earth, the likes of which I had never seen or heard. This was a unique day in my twenty-six years of life, living the life of Grandmother Liu. This paradise is in the suburbs of Shanghai, reachable directly by tram. Stepping off the tram, I saw many cars lined up densely in the distance. Besides two armed police officers standing at the gate, there were also several servants in white uniforms, welcoming the distinguished guests emerging from the cars on behalf of their master. Although the gate was also made of iron, it did not appear particularly tall, but upon entering, it was truly dazzling!</p>
<p>First, attracting everyone's attention was a fountain in the garden, about three or four square fathoms in circumference, in a rectangular shape. At each corner were four carp, seemingly carved from white jade. In the center of the round pool, four nude fairies also stood, facing opposite the carp, so the water喷ed from the carp's mouths landed precisely on the fairies' hidden parts. "This master really knows how to have fun!" everyone thought. It is said that this pond was imported from the United States at a cost of six thousand gold yuan. No wonder the white jade was so delicate, the carvings so exquisite, and the switches for 喷ing water and the devices for draining and changing water were so mechanized!</p>
<p>Beyond the fountain was a trimmed lawn. To the south of the garden was a golf course, and to the west were glass greenhouses and wisteria trellises. Scattered here and there were various exotic flowers. Of course, Grandmother Liu could not name the flowers. Even after a knowledgeable person gave a detailed introduction, the names were still difficult to remember. However, today was for chrysanthemum appreciation, so I could still recognize the chrysanthemums. But even the chrysanthemums seemed like nothing I had ever seen before. They were taller and larger than those Grandmother Liu grew at home. Each pot had eighty or ninety blooms, the size of peonies, all neatly arranged, clean, and plump. "Probably foreign breeds too?" I asked a more experienced companion. "Of course! Our master only uses imported goods. You'll see when we look at the interior furnishings later!"</p>
<p>The master lived in a three-story modern Western-style house. The downstairs center was a large living room, with a floor made of smooth small pieces of wood, probably for dancing. One side was a smoking room, with only a long sofa and a large tea table with some goldfish bowls and antiques. This room could be considered the simplest in terms of furnishings. The other side was a reception room, with tables and chairs made of rosewood and other precious woods, also with many antiques as usual. What I remember most were the ingenious designs of the various electric lights. Some were birds standing on frames, some were dogs lying on the ground, some were fish hanging from chains, and some were lions playing with embroidered balls. The light sources were located in the birds' heads, dogs' paws, fish eyes, and embroidered balls. The arrangement of the lights was also quite elaborate. For example, the bird frame was installed on the wall, the lion and embroidered ball were hung in the middle of the room, the dog was installed under the door, and the fish was suspended above the desk. It can be seen that in the wealthy's eyes, the same light, in addition to its lighting function, also serves as an artistic appreciation. This is truly what is meant by "When one has surplus energy, then one seeks art." Admirable! Admirable!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the second floor and above were all the young ladies' and mistresses' boudoirs, and outsiders could not easily go up except for close relatives. However, according to those who had been there, the rest can be imagined: copper beds, sofas, beaded curtains, white porcelain flush toilets, bathrooms, etc., can also be seen in large hotels. However, two things were truly "only to be found in heaven, and suspected not to exist on earth!" One was that the light could change color at any time. For example, yellow was used when it was hot, red was used when it was cold, to help increase or decrease the temperature, lake blue was used under the moonlight, and white was used at night to suit the environment. Moreover, because each lamp had its own switch, the light colors could be freely adjusted. For example, turning on a few red lights and then a few white lights could change it to light pink, and then turning on a few green lights would make it purple, like a painter's rendering, with endless changes. The other was that the sofas and other furnishings could automatically move into the wall by means of a mechanism, and then automatically come out by means of another mechanism. Thinking about the master's intention, it would be more accurate to say that he wanted to joke with the chairs than to say that he wanted some status! Ah! Mysterious paradise!</p>
<p>The base of this paradise is worth about two hundred thousand, the construction cost of the house is three hundred thousand, but the interior decoration also requires more than two hundred thousand! Where did this huge sum of money come from? Isn't it the blood and sweat of the toiling masses living in grass shacks and pigeon coops?</p>
<p>The master, like other wealthy men, has four wives and concubines, but only gave birth to two daughters. Fortunately, in addition to a few old nannies, maids, and female servants, there are also a large number of rickshaw pullers, attendants, guards, security guards, and gardeners, so that the yin energy is not too heavy. However, in such a large house, the master's enjoyment is quite limited, and in fact, he spends more time away, which allows the servants to enjoy their blessings. They are truly reincarnated lucky ones!</p>
<h3>The Kind Master</h3>
<p>— Zhou Nianci</p>
<p>A wealthy family in the countryside</p>
<p>The radio that Gao Sheng recently brought back from Shanghai was installed in the master's small study. This was originally suggested by the fourth concubine, so it should have been placed in her room, but this was a rare newfangled item in the countryside, and putting it in the study, where guests often came and went, could show off to the guests. Moreover, the master could also show his wives that he wasn't as exclusively fond of the fourth concubine as the rumors said.</p>
<p>The master's taking of concubines did not contain any lustful motives, but was entirely out of genuine filial piety, and to uphold the ancient sages' instruction that "of the three unfilial acts, having no offspring is the greatest."</p>
<p>The fourth concubine had already been married, and the forty-five-year-old master still hadn't produced a son, or even a daughter. When the master was lying on his couch smoking opium, he couldn't help but complain about the incompetence of his four concubines in the dim light of the bean-sized lamp!</p>
<p>It is said that the master had a stable destiny, so he was able to protect his family property. Every year, he relied on the harvest from the fields to support his wives and concubines and have enough to eat and wear. He considered himself a law-abiding citizen and was also quite self-righteous as a good person.</p>
<p>A good person likes to do good deeds. As long as the villagers have collateral, he is very willing to lend them money to help the poor in times of crisis. The most welcome collateral is land, and he doesn't care much about the interest.</p>
<p>The master is also very polite to his tenants. He absolutely denies having any behavior of detaining or treating tenants harshly. If there is any, it is the loyalty of the stewards, and he cannot stop it!</p>
<p>In famine years, the master is willing to lend rice seeds to the farmers, but it is not limited to his own tenants. Although they have to return double in the autumn, it is always a good deed to help people in need.</p>
<p>When farmers borrow money and fail to repay it on time, the good person believes that their family is truly poor, and helping people must be thorough, so he immediately inquires if they have any children. If so, the good person can provide convenience, and might as well bring them home to raise, but nominally they are called pageboys and maids!</p>
<p>The kind master sometimes also forbids his concubines from using their opium pipes to prick the fair faces of pretty maids.</p>
<p>The small study is the master's only place of recreation. There, there are several shelves of block-printed books, ready for leisure after smoking opium, to browse and relax on the exquisite opium couch in the dim light. The main reason he collects books is to proclaim himself an erudite scholar, a recluse. He has never done any business in his life. He inherits the legacy of his ancestors, from young master to old master, fixedly growing up in X Village, Gaoyou County, but his knowledge is not lacking, and he is also enthusiastic about public welfare. His family constantly supports a dozen or so local militia members, not only to enhance his own prestige and urge the collection of land rent, but also for the benefit of the public in the village!</p>
<p>When the hot summer arrives, the elegant music and the strong aroma of Sichuan tobacco, as well as the laughter of women, are constantly spreading from the master's small study in the third courtyard of the great mansion, spreading to the ears and noses of the people who are working the waterwheels in the fields under the scorching sun. So everyone says plainly and habitually... "Our master is truly blessed!"</p>

<h3>Special Self-Professional Introduction Fallen Leaf Without a Master</h3>
<p>— Lu Lüxiang</p>
<p>I am a naive and innocent flower, but I have been transformed into a fallen flower by the hypocritical and domineering winds and torrential rains that attack day and night. However, I am unwilling to follow the stream to the end of the world, because I still have parents, elderly and sickly parents who hope for my success.</p>
<p>What I have is youth, appearance, advanced ideas, and physical strength for hard work. I don't lie, and I don't have a fancy resume as my coat. My strength is to be responsible. I can fill the positions of proofreader, transcriber, document clerk, or factory administrator, Chinese shorthand, etc. However, there are two points to be declared in advance: 1) The best working hours per day are within eight or nine hours, because I want some free time to practice shorthand and other academic skills; 2) The monthly salary is at least around thirty yuan, because I have parents, and in addition to providing for my own living expenses, I also have to subsidize my family.</p>
<p>I am a naive and innocent flower, but now I am a fallen flower because of my extremely limited source of income. Although I intend to follow the stream, I still hope that there will be such a stream to keep this fallen flower from being permanently trapped in suffering. Please forward replies through this publication.</p>
<p>Social Anatomy Room</p>
<h3>"Oppose Class Struggle" and "Support Labor-Capital Cooperation"</h3>
<p>— Mao Wei</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Lu Yongwei's article "Oppose Class Struggle and Support Labor-Capital Cooperation" in the last issue, I felt that the points raised by Mr. Lu are worth discussing. Now, standing on the standpoint of science, I will objectively conduct an academic discussion with Mr. Lu. If Mr. Lu has any objections, he may raise them for discussion again.</p>
<p>First, we need to talk about class, because only by understanding whether classes exist can we determine the fact of class struggle. If China really, as Mr. Lu said, has no classes, only the distinction between the very poor and the slightly poor, then no matter how people advocate class struggle, it will never become a reality. Unfortunately, the objective reality is greatly contrary to what Mr. Lu said. China, not only because of the invasion of imperialism, has created a relationship of national capitalism, making the bourgeoisie and the laborers develop in the same proportion, but also has compradors, warlords, and bureaucrats sitting on huge wealth everywhere, and in the countryside there is a vast opposition between peasants and wealthy gentry landlords. Although these classes have their essential differences, it cannot be denied that they are not historical classes. Where there are classes, the fact of class struggle is naturally unavoidable. The struggles of peasants resisting rent and taxes and workers striking are good examples, not as Mr. Lu said, "the cause of class struggle is the sharp conflict between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat," but a fact that exists wherever there are classes, but is currently becoming more intense. This is because currently not only the struggle between the bourgeoisie and the laborers has become a sharp manifestation, but also the so-called middle-class petty bourgeoisie, small businessmen, self-cultivating farmers, handicraft workers, intellectuals, and salaried laborers have been drawn into the vortex of struggle. Because these middle-class elements have similarly been oppressed and exploited by imperialism, compradors, warlords, bureaucrats, wealthy gentry, landlords, and the bourgeoisie in recent years, they are increasingly on the verge of bankruptcy and falling into the state of laborers. Therefore, they must also stand on the side of the laboring masses and closely unite with the laboring masses in order to find a way out. As for Mr. Lu blaming the national economic bankruptcy on class struggle and ignoring that it is caused by imperialist aggression, Mr. Lu is too ignorant of the actual social situation to reverse cause and effect in this way!</p>
<p>Secondly, speaking of increasing production, Mr. Lu believes that as long as production can be increased, China's livelihood problems can be solved. He did not see that under the shackles of imperialism, it is impossible to increase production in China. To take a step back, even if imperialism allows you to increase production, only the capitalists will benefit, and it will never be possible to meet the needs of the majority as Mr. Lu hopes. Because the increase in production under capitalism is not like the increase in production under socialism (such as the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan, which increases production in an orderly manner according to the needs of the whole society and with the welfare of the masses as the basis), but is for the capitalists' own profits, and the general laboring masses still have to suffer very severe exploitation. Moreover, if there is no profit to be made from production that is beneficial to the masses, but producing general luxury goods can obtain a large amount of profit, then, undoubtedly, the capitalists will inevitably abandon production that is beneficial to the masses and produce luxury goods as much as possible. The result will be a phenomenon of overproduction and underconsumption in society, causing the laborers to suffer unemployment and other great pains. Not only is the distribution problem not solved, but it is simply impossible to talk about it. Therefore, the result of promoting labor-capital cooperation and increasing production is only to sacrifice the laboring masses and allow the capitalists to make a fortune, and it will never solve the livelihood problem.</p>
<p>Finally, let's see if "national disaster" can be "faced together." According to the above, class struggle is an inevitable fact, labor-capital cooperation and increasing production are impossible, and solving the national disaster requires the implementation of anti-imperialist struggle. But the united front of anti-imperialist struggle has long been betrayed by the national bourgeoisie. The clever national bourgeoisie has long seen that the anti-imperialist struggle has developed to another new period, the power of the laboring masses has become huge, and their demands have exceeded the limits of the national bourgeoisie, enough to harm the interests of the national bourgeoisie itself. Therefore, they not only dare not participate, but instead surrendered to imperialism and helped imperialism hinder the progress of the anti-imperialist struggle. Such examples are clearly unnecessary to mention now, but even in the early stages of the anti-imperialist May Thirtieth Movement, it can be seen. When the May Thirtieth Movement was in full swing, the imperialism of the Shanghai Concession stopped the supply of electricity to Chinese-owned yarn factories, and the Chinese capitalists immediately begged for mercy from imperialism, revealing their cruel faces and helping imperialism attack the laboring masses, forcing them to stop the anti-British and anti-Japanese strikes. Therefore, according to this situation, no matter how you plan to "face" the "national disaster" "together," the exploiting class will never come and "face" it with you. It will only use you under its high-sounding rhetoric as a sacrifice to ingratiate itself with imperialism. Since "facing together" is inherently impossible, then naturally only the laboring masses who suffer the deepest oppression from imperialism are the revolutionary fighters who bear the heavy responsibility of "anti-imperialism"!</p>
