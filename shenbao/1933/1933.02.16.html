<p>（日内瓦）　今日（十四）十九特委會之會議、有滿塲一致之特色、先討論日本來函、繼乃草擬覆函、會衆旋討論熱河問題、决定通知日代表、吿以時局之任何加劇、將使調解新努力爲之破壞、會衆後通過建議案、稍加以不重要之修正、並補充談判委員會人選一節、决定談判委員會應以下列代表組成之、</p>
<p>㈠十九特委中自願加入之委員、關於此節加以說明、因談判或將在遠東舉行、凡願參加者、必須準備前往遠東辦事、</p>

<p>會衆又决定星期二日國聯大會之會議、須討論並决定調解一幕之結束、缓三日再開第二次會議、討論此報吿書、大約國聯大會尙須於星期六日開第三次即最後之會議、</p>
<h3 id="c13">建議案缺點期限未規定 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>今日集議時、愛爾蘭代表萊斯特詢問、如兩造之一拒絕建議、則將如何辦理、秘書長德魯蒙答稱、渠以爲須有三個月之猶豫期、期滿後向國聯大會提出新報吿、但愛爾蘭所提出之點殊不明瞭、職是之故、建議案中未曾言及猶豫期一節云、</p>
<p>比代表波爾康謂渠在集會前曾與中代表顔惠慶博士談話、顔博士認建議案中尙有缺點、即未曾規定期限是、顔博士請人注意於期限之需要云、</p>

<p>衆以爲建議文尙未送交兩造、故其意見當然不能即予以考慮、但覺愛爾蘭代表萊斯特已指出弱點、蓋國聯盟約關於此點、殊屬含混也、此處　可謂有一嚴重罅隙、如日本置建議案於不理、則將何以應付之、國聯盟約第十二條僅謂會員國非俟國聯大會提出報吿書三個月後、不得從事戰爭耳、雖十九特委會之多數委員皆以爲國聯不能洗手不問、但按諸盟約究應有何種步驟、則無人能言之也、</p>

<p>今日日方發言人諷示國聯大會舉行公開會議時、松岡將作重要之姿勢、宣布日本退出國聯、但一般人咸以爲日本必不遽作此積極行動、日本或將靜待發展、然後再决定切實行動、惟星期二日國聯大會開會時、中日代表難免發表重要言論、上次國聯大會開會時、松岡因不承認「滿洲國」問題、曾大發議論、今建議案明白規定不承認「滿洲國」、或將再使松岡大放厥詞也、</p>
<p>會塲公報　今晚國聯方面發表公報、全文如下、</p>
<p>今日午後十九特委會集議、首先考慮日總代表松岡致特委會關於二月九日所詢問題之覆函、議定由秘書長代表函覆、特委會旋宣讀並審議昨所提出之修正文初稿、後通過報吿書首三段、如調解失敗、則此報吿書即將根據盟約第十五條第四節提交國聯大會、特委會繼乃進行報吿書第四段、即建議文之初讀、稍予修飾亦即通過之、大會决定於下星期二召集、國聯大會報吿書全文一俟印成後、大約在本星期杪即將分送國聯各會員、同時將由國聯電臺發出無綫電及有綫電、分達各國政府電臺或電局（十四日路透電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3 id="c21">嚴重時期已至……國人猛省　元 <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>國際聯盟近忽一變其躊躇不定之態度。而毅然主持公理。十九特委會已通過報吿書全部草案。不可謂非日本外交上之大失敗。然吾人於此。若欣喜外交上助我有人。而稍自寬懈。暗墮其奮鬥之精神。或則利用國聯與日本决裂之機會。以爲我可躱避一隅。以坐收漁人之利。或又以爲日本不勝國聯之壓迫。而終將屈服就範。我國難可從此稍紓。果爾。則大誤特誤。</p>
<p>國聯今日雖已通過報吿書於十九特委會。但將來在大會上有無變化。尙未可知。即使一無變化。亦能如十九特委會順利通過。然通過之後。而不進一步以盟約第十六條制裁方法。壓迫日本。則報吿書之效力。亦等於零。目前在國聯方面之空氣。雖若甚形激昂。然其對於第十六條之援用。尙在設法避免。蓋於其自身之利害。關係切。糾紛多。絕無毅然施行之勇氣。據昨報外電。國聯領袖人物。預料施於日方之壓力。將依據九國公約與非戰公約。而不依據國聯盟約。在表面言之。此固可以避免邀請美俄協助施行壓力之形迹。然國聯究處於解决中日爭案之主要地位。而反不援用盟約。亦屬令人難以索解。近日有人懷疑國聯。謂十九特委會以此報吿書提送大會。大會於通過後宣布世界。或即藉以結束。以爲國聯做到如此。業已智盡能索。從此吿一階段。果如是者。國聯特藉此主持公理之空言。敷衍面子以求下台耳。而我國則失地依然未復。即使將來能依據報吿。談判委員會組成。而又無一定期限。委蛇延宕。非特仍舊不了。反多枝節。日本則進行侵略如故。此種險象。絕非出於意外。我國人亟應預爲計及者也。</p>
<p>日本方面。雖經國聯重大壓迫。而其態度。絕不稍變。對於進兵熱河一事。尤堅不放鬆。松岡答覆德魯蒙之勸吿。謂日本不欲停止對熱之軍事行動。「滿洲國」準備協同日軍。肅清熱河省所有之華軍云云。其對於國聯毫不在心目中。已顯然可見。故今日無論其應付國聯之態度若何。而與僞組織協力以攻取熱河。乃爲目前即將實現之事。脫退國聯固必攻熱。即不脫退國聯。亦必攻熱。迫以國聯盟約非所懼。即加迫以九國公約非戰公約及一切國際公法。亦非所顧。近其對於熱河所以按兵不動者。以尙欲觀察國際聯盟之形勢。利用其勾結與挑撥之手段。冀獲得若干效果。助其聲威。以滿足其更大之慾望耳。今於國際聯盟。旣已無望。則惟有索性束置其縱橫捭闔之外交策略。而一意從事於武力。一切任我自由行動。一年半以來國際間外交之副劇旣終。即武力之正幕。從之開始。試問我國人在此武劇中。爲劇烈鬭爭之主角者何人。與之對手爭鬭者又爲何人。倘不捨命相搏。又有何人能爲我助。失敗之後。我又將自居何等。此皆爲我國人所當猛然反省者也。</p>
<p>吾人昨論國聯盟約十五條第四項進行以後。已勗勉我國人以今後應有之努力。今所以復再嘵嘵者。因一般人尙以此國際聯盟之新形勢。爲有利於我。而自欣幸。自寬慰。偷安旦夕之念復生。殊不知在此新形勢之下。非特不能偷安。且當努力奮起。非特國難並未稍紓。且益迫於嚴重關頭。政府嚴密整飭軍備。各將領一致團結。集中力量。以抗此暴橫之强敵者。在此時期。我全國人奮其所有之人力財力物力。一致動員。以爭我民族存亡一綫之關頭者。亦在此時。今日字林西報評論此事。謂中國人自助之機會已至。國聯之主張公理。不過道德上之勝利。而成功則須由全中國人自起奮鬭。友邦希望我之輿論。尙且如此。我國人奈何反自處於旁觀。而不急求所以自救耶。熱河之形勢。今已危急萬分。國人其速醒。</p>
<h3 id="c22">建議案全文 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>(日内瓦）　九人小組委員會之建議案、今日以最後方式分送十九特委會、現所發表之文、與本月十二日電傳於外之節略、僅在字句排列上稍有不同、不過全文甚多引證文耳、除引證外、全文大致如下、</p>
<p>第一章　引證國聯盟約第十條非戰公約第二條·及九國公約第一條、並聲稱、國聯大會通過十二月十日白里安所宣佈之原則、又稱、行政院十二委員會於一九三二年二月十六日援引此項原則、勸吿日政府、聲明任何國聯會員國土地完整之破壞、及政治獨立之變更、因蔑視國聯盟條第十條而造成者、不得爲國聯各委員　承認、</p>
<p>建議案至此乃聲明爲根據上述國際約定成立中日間永久諒解起見、中日衝突之解决、必須依照調查團之下列條件、即李頓報吿書中十項原則、㈠適合中日雙方之利益、㈡考慮蘇俄利益、㈢遵守現有各方面之條約、㈣承認日本在滿洲之利益、㈤成立中日間之新條約關係、㈥切實規定解决將來糾紛之辦法、㈦滿洲自治㈧内部之秩序、與免於外來侵略之安全、㈨獎勵中日間之經濟協調、㈩以國際合作促進中國之建設、</p>
<p>第二章</p>
<p>第一節　滿洲主權屬於中國、故國聯大會建議在適當時期内在滿洲設立一種機關、隸屬於中國主權之下、並適合中國行政之完整、賦有廣大之自治權、應合法律條件、並顧慮日本之特殊權利、現有之多方面條約、第三方面之權利、及第一章所載之一般原則與條件、中國中央政府與地方當局彼此權限與關係之决定、由中政府宣佈之、而有國際擔任之效力、</p>
<p>第二節　日軍之駐於南滿鐵路區域之外、與解决爭議所必須遵守之法律上原則相牴觸、故國聯大會建議此項軍隊之撤退、</p>
<p>本文此後所建議之談判、其第一旨趣、應爲辦理此項撤兵事、並决定撤兵之條件階段及期限、</p>
<p>第三節　除上述兩建議案所處理之問題外、調查團之報吿書言及若干其他問題、妨害爲遠東和平所繫之中日間良好諒解者、故國聯大會建議雙方應根據調查團所載之上述原則與條件解决此項問題</p>
<p>第四節　爲實行以上各建議案所必要之談判、應見諸實施、而雙方之任何一方不能提出與上述各建議不相適合之條件、故國聯大會建議雙方依照以下歸定之方法開始談判、</p>
<p>請兩造各通知秘書長、是否在對方亦接受此項解决之唯一條件下、接受國聯大會所建議之解决辦法、談判將以國聯大會按照下述而組成的委員會之襄助舉行之、</p>
<p>組成此委員會者、爲九國公約之簽字國及十九特委聲明自願加入之任何會員、一俟秘書長聲稱兩造接受國聯大會之建議後、即行指派各代表、</p>
<p>秘書長並須照會美俄兩國、吿以兩造之接受建議、並請其派員加入此委員會、秘書長於接到兩造接受建議之通知後、一個月内須採行各種相當步驟、以便開始談判、爲使國聯會員國於談判開始後判斷雙方之任何一方是否依照建議行事起見（甲）此委員會應報吿談判進行之狀態、尤其是關於上述第一節第二節建議案實施之談判、並無論如何須於談判開始三個月内報吿關於第二節建議案之進行、凡此項報吿須由秘書長送交國聯、（乙）此委員會可將關於第二章解釋之問題、提交國聯大會、</p>
<p>國聯大會須以本報吿書依照國聯盟約第十五條第十節而成立之同樣的條件、加以解釋、</p>
<p>第三章　現所建議之解决辦法、異於一九三一年九月以前原狀之僅僅恢復、亦不許滿洲現狀之維持與承認、因此種維持與承認不適合現有國際義務之基本原則、並抵觸爲遠東和平所繫之中日兩國間良好諒解也、</p>
<p>國聯會員國於通過本報吿書之際、顯然對於滿洲現局不得作可礙及本報吿書建議案實施或延緩其適用之任何行爲、</p>
<p>會員國將繼續不在法律上或事實上承認滿洲此種現狀、會員國對於滿洲時局不欲作任何單獨行爲、并欲彼此提携行事、并於可能時會同有關係之非會員國共同行動、</p>
<p>此外國聯會員國之爲九國公約簽字國者、已允無論何時如發生一種時局、而此時局據任何簽字國之意見、涉及九國公約條文之適用、並使此種適用之討論爲適宜者、則有關係之簽字國間須有充分坦直之接洽、</p>
<p>爲就可能範圍内依照本報吿書之結論在遠東成立一種局勢起見、爰諭令秘書長將本報吿書副本分送非爲國聯會員但爲九國公約或非戰公約簽字國之各國、吿以國聯大會之希望、願其贊助本報吿書所表示之見解、並於必要時與國聯會員國採取同樣之行爲與態度、（十五日路透電）</p>

<p>丨朱次循君來信丨</p>
<p>讀本月五日先生答復任望月君所問：「我的自殺觀對否？」我覺得先生的思想，未免有點貴族色彩，根本沒有想到自殺人們掙扎的痛苦，完全立在幽間階級的地位唱高調！我以爲自殺，固然不是人類向上的心理，不過我們要推想到自殺的動機，根本要歸咎於社會制度的不良。像任君所說第一種的自殺，先生所反對的理由是：「一個人只要有健全的精神與思想，就是他是瞎子，聾子，跛子，都有他的工作效能，都有他盡力於社會的機會，若果因爲身體不健康，而太衰弱了，便要自殺，老實說，中國人總　自殺一大半。一這種理由，當然不差，但我要問先生健全的精神與思想，是不是要有相當的培養？這種培養的方法，是不是仍舊要社會的力量去造成？第二，瞎子，聾子，跛子，都可盡力於社會，試問怎樣盡力？有沒有盡力的機會？去年我親自看到一個孤苦無依的殘廢者，不能進殘廢院請求撫養。殘廢院拒絕的理由，是人數逾額了。試問這種殘廢者，呌他怎樣去奮鬥？任君所說第二種的自殺，先生所反對的理由是：「黑暗的奴隸的生活是壓迫社會與不平等的社會的一種黑暗勢力形成的，要打破這種黑暗勢力，非結合社會上極偉大，極堅决的革命力量，並藴蓄着極悠久，極實貴的鬥爭的經騐，並扶有極堅强，極穩固的戰爭組織，不能達到成功。」話是對的，不過，我以爲奴隸生活的人們，假使有如先生上面所說的寈神，毅力，勇氣，那末他早脫去他的奴隸生活了。先生，你要曉得黑暗的奴隸生活，的確有像任君所說的要反抗衝破但又是不能呢！」我以爲掙扎不脫的黑暗的奴隸生活的人們，假使有勇氣自殺，未始不是大流血的革命。照現在政府頒佈了禁蓄奴婢的禁令，是不是中國就此沒有奴婢了，假使一個未成年的女孩給人家買去做婢女，試問呌她怎樣的反抗，怎樣的衝破她的黑暗的奴隸生活呢？再加上不良的風俗和習慣所造成的環境，我可以負責的說一句，决得不到旁人同情和援助，因爲受不了這種非人生活的痛苦而自殺的，事實是很多很多，我們不能說這種自殺，是奴隸對主人無條件屈服之最一澈底的一行爲，我們只好歸咎於社會制度的不良罷。而且反抗與衝破　動作，事實也沒有這樣的簡單，像從前美國林肯總統的解放黑奴，他經過多少的困難，被解放了的黑奴，一時尙要感到無所歸宿的痛苦，所以要反抗衝破黑暗的奴隸生活，並不是靠個人的力量好去做。</p>
<p>像任君第三種的自殺，先生所反對的理由是：「任君有什麽可以引起人家同情的學識與才能，配得上駟馬高車，豐衣足食，驕妻美妾，解决任君的苦悶和空虚。」理由是很充分。我們現在並不是自負，也不是責人，像現在社會中學識才能比較我們低的尸位素餐在那裏占着優越地位的人，也未始沒有，不客氣的話，假使像記者先生的人，也算不得人材，也不能說庸材；假使你失了業，受了窮困，你的職業，是給一個會拍馬屁的交際的庸材搶了去，那末，先生，你誠懇的對我說，你樂觀不樂觀？你苦悶不苦悶？到了那個處境，恐怕同情於先生的還要减少，先生也只可詛咒着社會制度的不良罷？假使先生到了這樣處境，還有良好的奮鬥途徑，請說其詳！那末懷着高上學識與才能的人們，得不到上進的時機在那裏潦倒，都要尊先生爲社會人羣的領袖了。我們並不是要學希臘的斯多噶學派Ｓｔａｉｓｂｍ來贊成自殺，曾經我也塗過幾篇什麽弱者的呼聲，靑年的煩惱，我的人生觀；不過我總以改良社會制度來做結論；自殺不一定是弱者的表示。所以在現在沒有程序的社會做人，處處有自殺的危機，救濟這種危機，非從努力的改良社會制度不可。怎樣的努力改良，我可又不敢說了。先生不能來提倡自殺，我們所希望於先生，有怎樣的方法來消滅自殺？問題是越說越遠，範圍也擴大了，就此住筆。先生以爲有討論的價値，我們就在讀者顧問欄内討論一下。（復信明日發表）</p>

<p>上海雞毛球錦標賽、昨日開始、林寳華邱飛海之雙打第一週賽、對兩葡人希那與雪而佛、劇戰之結果、林邱不幸以二比零淘汰、十八比十七、十五比五、最後又表演一局、林邱以十五比互獲勝、林寳華加人單打、第一週輪空、第二週賽將於二十五日舉行、</p>
<p>（新運動大有興味）雞毛球（貝明敦）賽、在外人雖已成爲極普遍之運動、在國人中則尙爲一新的運動、該球會爲提倡起見、昨晚特借北海路格致公學内球塲舉行、雖春雨滴滴、亟欲一觀此項新運動者、不下三四百人、觀至緊張驚險之處、掌聲不絕、表示極有興味也、</p>
<p>（第一局失得可惜）希那與雪而佛得先發球權、由克拉克任裁判、希雪一下得四分林邱奪回三分、繼而又成五比四、在此緊張之局面、忽起傾左傾右之形勢希雪突以八比四穿出、然而邱飛海輪値發球、一連奪回四分、打成八比八之平手、豈知對方又連得三分、十二比十時、局面突然展開、林邱追成各十二、反以十三比十二佔前、此時爲對方所殺、可惜者一、否則再得二分卽勝矣、旣而十三比十三、林邱乃呌息　、重以五分定勝負、希雪雖以三比一佔優勢、林邱殺之而連加三分、四比三超前、再有一分、亦可定勝、不料反爲對方得二分、總計林邱以十七比十八失第一局、僅負一分、</p>
<p>（第二局一　千丈）第二局方擬奮臂奪回、豈知形勢大變、林邱一不經意、對方連得七分之多、雖於此時奪得二分、希雪又以十二比二遠去、輪値邱飛海發球、大有中興局面、一下恢復三分、然終以十五比五再敗、遂以二比零淘汰、</p>
<p>（表演賽林邱獲勝）最後雙方以勝負已定、再表演一局、以餉觀衆、林邱一路順風、得九比二、兩葡人毫不屈服、奮鬭而上、果然成爲九比九、結果林邱以十五比九勝、故結果亦可謂之二比一、</p>
<p>（論球藝邱勝於林）兩葡人擊球有年、故聯絡上球藝上、皆較成熟、邱林二人之表演、亦頗不弱、觀第一局之成績可知、而邱尤勝於林、邱如加入單打、希望較林爲大、其殺球亦如其網球之人孔穿隙、擊人不備、殺球之有力、實較網球爲有味、林屢以在網前之輕挑試敵、然皆希那所破、抽球亦不如邱之穩、知經此提倡之後、將來大有希望也　　（卡那凡洛之談話）網球老將卡那凡洛吿記者曰、卡提倡貝明敦時、成立者僅二隊、今則風起雲擁、興味大生、足見愛之者有人、前年邱在滬時、卡與邱加入雙打、幾獲錦標、故今歲鼓動邱與林參加、以引起華人之興味、卡極願以球術授華人、如有願學習、　致函南京路時評洋行、卡可爲偕球塲練習、大好機會、幸毋失之、</p>

<p>滬江昨晚險遭失敗</p>
<p>三十六比三十三分</p>
<p>滬江對西靑</p>
<p>星期六决賽</p>
<p>昨晚甲二組滬江對麥令之戰、勝負有關决賽權之得失、滬江因風頭不順表演减色、上半時雖以二十三比十七佔先、但下半時十三分鐘内滬江僅得一分而麥令則得十五分之多、滬江反以二十四比、二十二落、四　五百餘觀衆、無不爲之驚駭萬分、呌寃不已、　而幾番苦戰、在最後七分鐘内、連得十二分、乃以三十六比三十三得最後勝利、險　險哉、而觀衆　　　躍、於此則更覺熱烈、</p>
<p>（麥令斯頻頻犯規）開賽交鋒、麥令頻頻犯規、並由吳國霖連中二球、故頗佔優勢、麥令積極抵抗、不稍示弱、康登茂雷各顯神通、馮念華孫寳慶不甘落後、連中三元、比數成十五比十、滬江勝前五分、當此之時、馮念華忽患脚傷、苦於行走、不得不離塲休息、可謂風雲不測、禍福無常矣、</p>
<p>（馮念華脚傷離場）小馮出塲後、由陸鍾惠人、由陸鍾恩代表鋒、從此分庭抗　、各有建樹、雙方表演、均少精彩、麥令旣無往日之勇、滬江亦無以前之順色、均因小心過分、反使動作失其自然、待上半時終了、滬江得二十三分、麥令得十七分、</p>
<p>（麥令大將罰出後）再戰聲起、康登首爲麥令加上一分、</p>
<p>繼之卽爲滬江陸鍾恩亦還敬一分、彼此逐鹿、均少建樹、滬江吳國霖一再發射、均失其目標、野而不中、麥令茂雷妙中、康登再加一分、别許潑又加二分、比數頓成二十三比二十四、滬江僅以一分佔先、但斯時麥令之别許潑忽以四次犯規罰出、麥令去此大將、咸以爲滬江可以高枕無憂、安知事實與理想、絕然相反、</p>
<p>（滬江竟一籌莫展）别許潑出後、由里阜庖代、球　反覺順利、康登遠中、比數以二十五比二十四突然超出滬江、茂雷繼續建功、成二士七比二十四、洋丘八狂呼呐喊、大爲得意、滬江見勢不妙、仍由馮念華調人、陸鍾惠退、軍容重振、力圖報復、但小馮旣不良於行、餘子亦覺失常、左打右攻、不得其籃而人、而　方則時被麥令竄入、里阜琴勃相繼得分、以三十二比二十四之大差、壓倒滬江</p>
<p>（七分鐘反敗爲勝）當斯時也、滬江惡運未脫、陸鍾恩又以四次犯規罰出、仍由乃弟調入、形勢益覺可危、如墮五里霧中、罔知所措、時鐘已去十三、尙餘七分鐘耳觀衆莫不焦急萬狀、頓足嗟嘆、滬江健兒、個個搖頭惋恨、幾番苦工、幾經奮鬥、始由蹺脚馮念華打破悶葫蘆、從此滬江精神大振、聲援之聲、高澈雲霄、於是風頭轉機、孫寳慶兩罰兩中、吳國霖連得三分、錢敬鏞馮念華又加五分、浩浩蕩蕩、滿塲人聲狂熱、神經興奮、直至鳴鑼收兵、滬江卒以三十六比三十三擊敗滬江、奪得上海籃球會甲組二部之决賽權、</p>
<p>（滬江西靑將决戰）滬江旣敗麥令後、榮膺甲二冠軍、查甲一優勝爲西靑、兩隊將採三賽兩勝、爭奪「别賽皮杯」、第一次定本星期六）十六日（交鋒、希望滬江好自爲之、以報西靑會中失敗之恥、昨晚成績如下、</p>

<p>— 潘仰葊</p>
<p>……………………………………</p>
<p>外貨内侵，舶來品充塞於　個家庭，這已經是一個不可諱言的事實：甚至於有一部分所謂摩登的家庭裏，無論是衣食住行，一切日用生活必需品，竟不能一日無外貨。即撇開經濟損失和漏巵入超許多嚴重的問題，我們號稱獨立的國家中，有許多不能離開外貨而生存的人，有若干不能離開外貨而生活的家，這卑劣的習慣，畸形的現象，又是何等的可羞！</p>
<p>而且，這受外貨支配最利害的家庭，多半是智識份子所組成的，有人謂受敎育程度愈高，推銷外貨愈力，所謂社會的先進，却先淪於此種境地，更是社會的大損失。在舉國力謀拯救國難的時候，尤其是規定爲國貨年的今年，我們應毫不猶豫的首先力除此項惡習。</p>
<p>所謂國貨的消費方面，家庭本來佔重要的地位，國貨界要自謀出路，固然要由生産銷售各方面共同努力，但如果一個家庭都能有服用國貨的决心，在國貨前途方面，却未始非開源的辦法；所以，在這次國貨運動中，我們從事於家庭國貨運動，是很有重大的意義的。</p>
<p>關於家庭國貨運動的實行方面，祇要大家除去崇拜舶來品的劣根性，服用國貨在生活方面，并沒有十分困難，而且新興國貨有許多代用品，有時且較外貨價廉而物美，試看最近開幕中國國貨公司的一切出品，我們已從事實方面找到勝於費辯的證明，所以，如果我們能明白這道理的話，如果國貨生産界再有代用品或一般國貨服用指導的說明，我們决沒有印度人服用毛氈那麽的犧牲。</p>
<p>至於宣傳，一家的嘗試成功，効力遠過若干的傳單標語。第一步我們固然希望智識婦女界的，身作則，因爲一般人的口碑勝　你沿門定傳呵！因一家血推及親戚鄰友，漸進的推廣，如果建樹起這麽良善的風俗，其成功又豈祗限於一時呢！而我們男子們！也莫要因不顧問家事而放棄了責任，向你的夫人或姊妹勸說，比較向一般人容易進言，我們旣然志願於此次國貨運動中有所努力，當然應自本身家庭做起。</p>
<p>所以，我們要注意於家庭國貨運動；在每個家庭中，建樹起我愛國貨，我買國貨，我用國貨的道德和信仰！</p>

<h3 id="c171">中日紗業之近况 <a href="#c171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— 吟閣</p>
<p>近來因兵事水災等種種關係，中國紗業殊受影響，而日本在滬紗業則更爲不振。滬戰發生以前，日商存貨有五萬六千件。戰事發生停工三個月。四月復業後，因我國抵貨甚烈，銷場極少。而僞國關稅獨立，於上海日紗亦有打擊。從前抵制日貨因華紗僅能應需要之半，故每不能持久。大約半年之後，日貨必復暢銷。此次則不然。東案未結，滬變繼起。抗日運動，較爲深刻。再加以長江水災，國貨發展，在在足以阻碍日紗之銷路。故日本在滬紗業幾有一蹶不振之勢。而華商所出之紗，每月增三萬四千八百件，存貨增至八萬餘件，較之日廠之僅存三萬餘件者不同。惟日商之紗廠管理得法，其經營花業之公司，於世界各地有販賣網，易於增闢新市場。反之華廠資本較小·公積較少者，每不能　健進行。所望互相協助，并精研技術，以與日人競。勿以最後五分鐘之懈忽，致啓敵人之侵入。則於國民經濟前途大有益矣。</p>
<h3 id="c172">我來介紹幾種土布 <a href="#c172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— 陳警愚</p>
<p>衣服無非障身之具，祗消穿在身上，足以遮蔽四肢，保持體温，就可馬馬虎虎，將就過去。何必定需高貴的質料，致花費好多金錢呢！那末，欲求經濟而又耐久的織物，厥惟鄉間所産的土布了！</p>
<p>談到土布，原屬我們松屬一帶的産物，形形色色，花樣着實不少！去年滬上開會展覽時，陳列的土布，竟達一百數十餘種之多，大半是我松屬所産。而浦東之「奉」「南」「川」各縣，尤以産生土布著稱！就拿我們「奉賢」而言，鄉人日常所御的衣服，可得而寓目者，其顔色花紋·至少已在三五十種。近頃更有一般賦性聰敏的婦女·居然心裁别出·有所發明。把固有的織布機具，略事改良，增添脚踏。（原本二隻·現增成四）。於此足覘牠的紗縷加多，梭織複雜；而所産成績，亦遂愈臻優美！現在竟有幾種新出的貨品，爲去歲展覽會中所未見；而其頴異悅目，實超外貨而過之！我特來給牠介紹於後，藉供國貨公司之採購。</p>
<p>水浪布　牠的花紋屈曲像水中波浪，質言之，絕似一種人字花的嗶嘰。係用雙層細紗交織而成，其質厚而柔，裁作衷衣，固然最好！但以之染成顔色，製爲男女長袍，也極雅致，驟視之，幾疑嗶嘰，唯欠光澤。</p>
<p>雞毛巾　顔色紗中間以白紗，織成片片雞毛的形狀。女子用做旗袍，頗稱美觀！靑年男子的罩衫以及小兒衣服，均甚相宜！</p>
<p>眼睛布　也以色紗和白紗爲之，滿幅花紋，彷佛盡屬人目。裁製衣服，宜於女人孩子！</p>
<p>我雖然不是「布衣會」會員，然而亦是提倡布衣者之一人。目前旣有這種很好的土布，凡我中國人民，自應在茲經濟衰落，外侮迭乘之際，大家一致起來力求搏節！從事於素食布衣。即有所需應往國貨公司去採購，把這减省下來的金錢·盡量地輸助東北抗敵之義軍，俾能增進作戰的勇氣！而紓危亟的國難呵！</p>

<p>— 周成勛</p>
<p>每次走上被霓紅燈繚繞得眼花神炫的南京路，總是看見滿滿的「歐美物品」「泰西貨産」的招牌，壓窒得呌人氣悶，自從一星期來轟立了中國國貨公司，把一批一批醉心歐風美雨的紅男綠女的同胞，硬生生吸引進去，都深刋了「我愛國貨」的念頭跑出來，在國難日亟舶來充斥的這個年頭，着實是一件値得快慰的事，</p>
<p>中國人高嗓狂喊「提倡國貨」的歷史是由來已久，但是要有組織，有主義，脚踏實地去幹一番的確是很少很少，中國國貨公司聯合了許多著名的國貨工廠，搜集了不少有志救國的人才，通力合作，在三尊大砲巍然聳立的傍近，不計成敗的去做，我們且慢奢望他收效怎樣怎樣的巨大，但至少是給同胞們打了一次强心針。</p>
<p>中國國貨公司開幕的一天，在下去參觀了一次，從顧客或來賓擠得水洩不通和辦事人員忙得吃飯都沒有時間的情形看來，這種空前的盛况，眞是國貨界無上的收穫，但是否「開幕廉價九折」幾個字的力量，或者的確是同胞們愛國心的激發，倒是一個疑問？應使我們費一番腦力去解答。</p>
<p>過去的事實吿訴我們，一切國貨展覽會的效果，實在不能使我們十分滿意，這都是主事的有了營利的思想，同胞們抱了好奇的念頭造成的，要解答上面的疑問，全待該公司執事者努力做去以及同胞們眞切去認識。</p>
<p>我們韾香以祝中國國貨公司能夠挽回衰竭的國貨事業，能夠在同胞腦袋裏普播救國的種子！</p>

<p>早上的電車中，所有乘客，大部分是中小學的中外男女學生；外灘各洋行銀行公司中的職員，迢迢長途，一卷在手，是一個解悶的最好方法，我天天以讀書解悶，和我同用這方法以消遣的也很多。</p>
<p>學生讀書的，覺外國學生比中國學生多，中國學生所讀的書，則以西文爲多，展卷眼前，時而注視默念，時而仰首背誦，可想見其專心一志，津津有味。他們的書包裏，雖也帶着國文史地等書，可是取出來一讀的却絕無僅有，於此足以證明今日的學生喜歡外國文勝於中國文，今日的學校外國文功課也重於中國文。國歷元旦前後幾天，忽見他們類多讀中文書，我驚奇他們的讀書態度轉變了。旣而一想，哦！明白了！這時各學校不都在忙着大考嗎？寒假已近，各科都須考試，都須結束，他們利用車中閒暇，正是及時讀書，誰說是急來抱佛脚？</p>
<p>洋行銀行公司中人，他們所看的書，是武俠一類，是啼笑因緣一類。全神灌注，目不旁視，津津有味地不聞車聲隆隆，不覺車身簸動；查票人向他要票子他不覺，車子到了外灘他忘掉要下去。這類人惑於武俠，迷於情愛，可以概見！</p>
<p>摩登女子，伊們不像是學校的學生，因爲不帶書包。而手裏却携着一本簇新金字硬面的洋裝書，很倨傲地坐着捧着。偶而翻閱，也眞實行一個『翻』字，翻前翻後，像『書中自有黃金屋，書中自有顔似玉。』的在希望有所發現。有人說：伊這種作爲，那是在稠人廣衆中故爲之以自驕，讀西書不是很時髦嗎？在許多不識西文的人前，不是很有面子嗎？我說：不見得罷！何必以小人之心度君子之腹呢？還有伊們不讀而讀信在一個洋紙信封中抽出　張潔白的洋紙，上面全用藍水寫着一行行横行文字，伊每讀幾字，必得把頭仰起來看看車中人，我說伊這種態度，一定信中有什麽秘密怕給人窺見，所以提防若此。而據深研伊們的心理學者說：這是和翻金字硬面洋書者同一心理。</p>
<p>公館裏的飯司務，携着籃子乘車趕赴小菜塲，手揑着梁山伯祝英臺孟姜女，在高聲朗誦，像讀給大家欣賞似的。</p>
<p>一個電車中的區區幾種讀書，也足以窺見中國人心理的一斑。</p>

<p>丨投稿須知丨</p>
<p>誰都不願意一篇花了心血寫成的稿子給編輯先生投到字紙簏裏去，理由是很簡單的，每個投稿者都希望從投出的稿子身上獲得一點精神的和物質的報酬。</p>
<p>倘使你要研究一下投稿失敗的原因，你不能完全歸咎於自己的學力不夠，更不能責備編輯先生的不公，那只是因爲你將投稿純粹當作一件生意經，而不看作是一種，『藝術』，使你投稿的希望幻滅了。所以我們有理解投稿的藝術之必要。</p>
<p>投稿的第一件知識，就是要認清投稿的對象，因爲每個刋物都有它的個性與特質。僅僅是在申報上，我們只道每一種副刋都各有其讀者。投出的稿子如果能和你投寄的刋物在性質上完全水乳交融，那你便有十之七八命中的把握？</p>
<p>其次要注意到的，是投出的稿要新頴不凡，切忌人云亦云，在内容上與人雷同，平日尤其要注意着你所想投登的刋物發表的文字。如果你的題材是爲人所未寫過的，那你就有一大半把握從編者和讀者獲得你所期望的丨丨讚歎與共鳴。</p>
<p>要使你的寫作内容豐富，首先便須注意到從你的日常生活找題材，有時候，你會從和别人的閒談，從你的看報閱書，甚至從你的獨坐暝思中發見你聞所未聞思所未思的。你可以在這個時候把它記下來，那就是一篇絕妙的佳作。隨便想一想提起筆亂寫，是不能希望你的投稿避免墮入字紙簏的危險的。</p>
<p>最後要注意到一個總的原則，那就是在寫稿的時候，不要讓物質的慾望掩蓋了趣味，你儘管希望從你的投稿得到相當數目的物質報酬，但，如果沒有趣味</p>
<p>，還是不要寫的好。不然，你的文字即使登出來，結果會使自己看了失望的。</p>

<p>— 顧明道</p>
<p>凱君是個誠實的少年。有一次他家喬遷到一處新屋裏去住了，他家中祇有母子二人，雇着一個女僕，是個很簡單　的家庭。</p>
<p>進屋第二天的下午，他正在忙着懸鏡架，掛對聯，佈置他的書室，他的母親也在一邊帮忙；這時候門外忽然走進一個少婦來，身穿一件黑色駱駝絨的旗袍，四周滖着白邊，髮上也挽着一朶白絨花，臉龐兒却生得嬌滴滴的越顯紅白，尤其是一雙妖媚的眼睛，水汪汪地似乎有勾魂攝魂的魔力，年華尙不滿二十歲光景，還沒有脫離少女的靑春美。見了他們母子二人，略一招呼，便閒談起來。方知伊是房東太太的媳婦，能言能語，對人很是親熱，一見如故，很博人憐的。</p>
<p>凱君的母親以後悄悄地吿訴伊兒子說道：「紅顔簿命，世間眞多！你可知道那位房東太太的媳婦丨名喚菊韵的丨今年剛纔十九歲，已做了人問世最孤苦的孀婦了麽？」凱君驚起來道：「怎麽？伊已是一個孀婦麽？這樣如花美眷，似水韶年，怎耐得一生過那凄凉的光陰呢？并且伊以後的生活又如何呢？伊一生的幸福不是早已跟了伊已死的丈夫一齊埋葬到墳墓中去了麽？」凱君說畢，長長地嘆了一口氣。</p>
<p>伊時常要走到這邊來的，或是下午，或是晚上，手裏拿了十字布的架子，一邊做，一邊和凱君的母親絮絮談話，親熱得和家人一樣。漸漸把伊的身世心事吐露出來；據伊說出嫁不到三年，就做了未亡人。夫家已是式微，夫婿在日又不會賺錢，現在死後，伊的婆婆一錢也不肯給伊，只是喫口白飯，反要時時受閒氣。一家的人待伊如陌路人一樣，母家又沒有什麽人了無可倚靠，前途茫茫，不堪設想，自己年紀尙輕，很想出去做些事，得到自立的生活，可是又憾自己沒有學問。以前祗在小學裏畢了業，沒讀上去，現在需要了却沒有機會可以求學了。凱君的母親對伊很表同情，也時常安慰伊數語。凱君在傍聽着，愈覺得伊的身世十分可憐了。人類若有充分的同情性的，理當想些法兒去扶助這種弱者，這種悲哀埋在心坎中的人。（一）</p>

<p>南京，自從革命成功，　已換了身新裝，有似半老徐娘，穿起摩登衣裳，專在門面上做工夫，炫示着淺薄的羣衆。</p>
<p>幾條柏油大馬路，因爲有平民的地皮做基礎，寬闊得駭人，馬路當中，儘溜着中國人坐的外國汽車，在這「國貨年」頭，算是别緻的點綴，二旁石子路上，滿是黃包車，坐着糾糾武裝同志，一種幽閒的態度，使你想不起别一角上，因爲沒有隊伍用義勇軍在肉搏的故事，橫街空際跟路旁的牆壁電木，掛着貼着的是各色不同新舊互異的標語，口號救國，標語抵抗，才是仁義之邦的應有態度！</p>
<p>花牌樓是全城最熱鬧的地叚，提倡國貨的洋貨店，爲文化而奮鬥的書局，發起節衣的綢緞莊，主張縮食的酒飯館，密層層地排列二旁，張開大口想呑人，行人道上，擠滿了身掛招牌的文武同志，一手牽着愛人，二眼儘在巡視各店的貨品，街頭巷尾，跑滿了乞丐流民；悽切的救命聲，忍痛的賣子聲，十足地代表了全民族沒落的命運。可是這些聲音，蓋不住統治者嘴角邊上的笑印。</p>
<p>踏進夫子廟，好像另一世界。歌舞昇平，人生依舊是快樂的，廟旁店屋的雜亂，道路的泥濘，顯示了中國整個的混沌，櫛比鱗列的茶樓戲院，幾曲清歌，一片喧笑，簡直使人不信有所謂亡國恨，聞名的秦淮河，泛白了眼，冷清清地躺着，無人理眯，新年頭屋前廟後，塞滿了五彩的紙燈，看去花團錦簇，煞是美麗。</p>
<p>幽靜的去處，不是沒有？但招引不得遊人。紫金山頭的中山陵，雨花台上的孝儒墓，雞鳴寺品苟遠眺，玄武湖輕舟蕩漿，可惜都有忠烈遺蹟，我們這一代是愧對古人！</p>
<p>南京，謎也似的南京。摩登伽女比不了你這樣俏，二八佳人及不上你如此嬌。讚美吧，這敵人砲口瞄準下的南京！</p>

<p>— 朱𦐂</p>
<p>平坦廣闊的觀前街上，電燈與霓紅燈的光芒，映得天空也變了顔色；在薄暮時候觀前一角，確已見有南京路的雛形。何况那無線電播的帶人的歌聲；「賣花詞，」「小桃紅，」和「相公，小姐」的彈詞，到處一齣又一齣的，自朝至夜，散佈着靡靡的音調。」</p>
<p>西裝，燙得起了直線的時代少年，頭髮，燙得起了曲線的摩登女郎羣來，一羣去的儘在街上倘佯，紅色的絨衫，灰皮的大衣，黑絨的斗篷，紅，綠，黑，白種種顔色的衣衫，映在那三層或四層巍峩的宮殿般的建設物背景面前；假使不來雜着幾個釘梢的乞丐，蘇州確是個富麗的天堂！</p>
<p>元妙觀中；廟宇裏的香烟，終日是㲶㲶　　的凝聚不開，瞙拜的善男信女，此來彼往；和各種食攤上烹，熱，蒸，煮，五香異味的熱氣；浮動着來引誘人們皮包中的銀角銅元，滾滾流去。</p>
<p>那駭綠驚紅的零賣的女性，不時在「奉公安局諭嚴禁私娼人内」的旅館吿示下發現；是的，蘇州城廂内外，出賣皮肉的女性，據最近的調查，已超過了五百之數！</p>
<p>北局的電影院，和戲院，是天天宣吿滿座；每當鐵栅門扯開的當兒，擁擠的觀衆，總是波濤似的湧出。那一二八滬戰損失表：「人口的，死亡，二萬五千人，財産的損失二十萬萬元雖張在靑年會牆上，但是這已往的陳跡何足顧念！到靑年會瞧「啼笑因緣」的蘇州人，簡實連正眼都不瞧一眼！</p>

<p>市塲經過　昨日市塲中銀錢兩業交易情形、無論銀洋大都不甚起勁、良以目前廢厘聲浪漸高、勢在必行、各家籌備充足毋需再事進出、兼之業商業大部份事業、類部未展、需欵怠懈、爲意中事、宜其市面寥寥、而至於極岑寂之時期也</p>
<p>厘拆俱同　「洋厘」因銀錢兩業買賣清閑、故厘價早午兩市亦復相同爲七錢一分四厘八毫七忽半、較前日市價微好一毫二忽半、綠廢厘時期漸近、不能與標準厘價（七一五）距離過遠、有所重大低昂、「銀拆」以用途稀少、拆票不多、卒至銀根寬鬆、銀拆兩市始終白借、劃頭亦無加水、</p>
<p>輔幣平穩　江南小洋忽上忽落、午市似高二厘、爲六錢二分二厘、午市忽小二厘、仍爲六錢二、交易早市六千五百角、午市三千角、廣東小洋、早市爲五錢九分一厘、午市爲五錢九分○七毫半、交易早市六萬角午市二萬角、銅元仍爲四百十九千文、交易五萬○六百九十九串、計銀欵一萬二千一百兩、</p>
<p>銀收解淡　銀欵收解、銀行方面、昨日亦頗清寂、華商收解票欵一百六十餘萬、外商二百○數萬、墊欵九十餘萬、特欵二百七八十萬、押欵交易九十餘萬各種貨物匯兌押匯關稅洋什諸欵、收解六百六七萬、出倉八十萬、銀莊銀公單收解二千四百餘萬、銀劃頭欵收解三百十餘萬、各路匯欵四十餘萬、收現六十餘萬、</p>
<p>洋交鬆懈　昨日兩市塲中交易稀少、匯劃票欵早市五十六萬、午市五十六萬五千、鈔票早市四萬、午市四萬五千、塲外鈔票早市八萬五千、午市二萬、支單交易早市三萬、午市一萬、銀行交易、早市互市五十五萬、午市四十五萬、各銀行洋户往來收解九十餘萬、鈔標收回及發出一百三十餘萬、洋押欵交易七十餘萬、客路來源十五萬、錢莊洋公單收解四百四十餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解一百三十餘萬、拆借洋欵進出一百二十餘萬、小錢莊交易五十餘萬、</p>
<p>綜觀最近市况、以三月一日將實行廢厘制度、對於現在洋厘自無重大變動、銀根方面以七月一日將實行廢銀制度、對於現在雖距離尙遠、大多數不敢再開銀户往來、是以寬鬆爲事理所必有之舉耳、</p>

<p>昨日華商證劵交易所、公債市面、仍屬虚軟、外交空氣瞬息萬變、人心至爲不安、放出者防其月底軋空、且鑒於銀行界之收買、故未免稍有戒心、做多者亦恐中日問題一旦决裂、將有不可收拾之勢、故價忽上忽落、至爲不定、上午頭盤、交易甚少、各帮大都觀望、以待變化、市價有漲有跌、爲數祇三五角、在次盤未經開做前、忽傳日本又有將發通牒、限我熱河尅期退兵之說、物品交易所、收盤先做、狂跌二元、華商次盤、跌勢更狂、裁兵驟降三元之鉅、一時人心極爲虚萎、入後因有三十八及廿一號補空、跌勢稍差、但亦小一二元不等、公債市塲、可稱多事、午後兩盤比較平定、但仍有一元左右之上落、惟其趨勢、則大都未能一致、如開盤裁兵等回漲一元左右、入後又覺不振、收盤前列回小數角、入後又回漲數角、足徵人心之不定、故價亦參差不齊、且一種行市、其每盤之高低差額、往往有一元以上、市價漸有紊亂之象、全日結果、又跌去六七角至二元餘、其中廿關祗小六角、而裁兵獨跌兩元有零、成交總數、計共九百二十萬零六千二百元、現貨一千二百元、期貨裁兵一九關佔二百八十餘萬、統鹽稅佔五百零二萬五千之多、廿捲廿關亦均在一百萬以上、餘則十餘萬及六七萬不等、</p>

<p>後市略露一線轉機曙光</p>
<p>紗市跌風仍熾、因路透社消息、謂日本限吾軍退出熱河說、於是人心突現恐慌、商塲上賣風驟起、散多又現紊亂、忍痛斬結者頗踴、故市盤下墮、多頭崩潰、但有一部份心理價格較紅盤時已落六七兩、客銷如能發動、市面則可立定、然底貨太厚、壓力尙重云、</p>

<p>滬南　昨日來源僅三十餘號、銷塲亦未爽快、蘇同帮仍思做俏、故又喊起角外、其他各貨站定而已、然無正式去路、市况終難提升、包胃因有日本退出國聯趨勢、平津吃緊之謠、致有暫時停頓、今日所成交之薄稻、爲數極微、係屬行家上棧心思、並非正式去路耳、蘆羊尖亦見站定之局、通變陰元尙未蘇醒耳</p>
<p>滬北　昨日河下各帮到船三十三四號、白粳高料、取短價稍化、中次續交、價形高貨又帶疲勢、中次挺立、薄稻早稻另化交平、價趨定、羊尖到貨續有、零拆不惡、價亦高定、中次帶緊、埠杜尖緊起數分、陰元疲勢、白元到少消活、價加二角、今因天宮陰雨斛開無幾、</p>

<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、呈初跌繼高之勢、以洋麥報價跌三角、本月份開價時人心又不甚穩、初價袛一兩七錢六分半、惟以後因天津帮之收買、卽回至七錢七分七釐半、遠期開價、因本月份之疲而復昂、遂見平穩、二盤以後、津帮仍有問訊、故本月份曾高七錢九分、三四月份亦較初價好一分外、迨至下午開盤市氣復疲、因阜豐各盤均見出檔、數額頗巨、投機亦因洋麥定價、並鮮變動、且趨勢仍屬傾銷、所以脫手者亦頗湧旺、至各廠現粉、兵船老車仍加三分、雜牌加一分收盤結果三月份微好五釐、三四月份不動、五月份小二釐半、六月份小五釐、七月份不動云、</p>

<p>昨日荳餅交易活動、去路内地銷化尙淡、而温台厦門走勢略　、市况比初開見挫、黃荳仍居平疲、銷胃不儘、其到頭尙少、故外疲而内穩、菉荳烟台擇宜續辦、昨售開千餘包、江北明夾毛荳市做三兩二錢四分、中粒管店菜菉廣帮成交四百包、小麥本貨缺乏、所賴、温台麥有抵、故市屬平穩云、</p>

<p>蜜棗邇來到貨寥寥、存底亦薄、故市上驟感缺乏、求過於供、價遂步升、查貨稀之原因尙遠在前年、蓋前年因出品過多、至去年春曾跌至十餘兩、貨主皆遭巨虧、故去年出品乃大爲减少、以致造成現在之高價、昨市蘭谿秃秃售至三十八兩、亦有看至四十兩者、上下檔仍照向例加退、趨勢堅挺、</p>

<h3 id="c224">電的利弊 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— 何家幹</p>
<p>日本幕府時代，曾大殺基督敎徒，刑罰甚凶，但不准發表，世無知者。至近年，乃出版當時文獻不少。曾見『切利支丹殉道記』其中記拷問敎徒情形，或牽到温泉旁邊，用熱湯澆身；或四周生火，慢慢的熏烤，這本是火刑，但主管者却將火移遠，改死刑爲虐殺了。</p>
<p>中國還有更殘酷的。唐人說部中曾有記載，一縣官拷問犯人，四周用火遙焙，口渴，就給他喝醋，這是比日本更進一步的辦法。現在官廳拷問嫌疑犯，有用辣椒煎汁，灌入鼻孔去的，似乎就是唐朝遺下的方法。曾見一個囚在反省院裏的靑年的信，說先前身受此刑，苦痛不堪，辣汁流入肺臟和心，已成不治之症，即釋放亦不免於死云云。此人是陸軍學生，不明内臟構造，其實倒掛灌鼻，可以由氣管流入肺中，引起致死之病，却不能進入心中，大約此人因在苦楚中，知覺瞀亂，遂疑爲已到心臟了。</p>
<p>但文明人所造刑具，慘酷却超出於此種方法萬萬，本地有電刑，一上，即遍身痛楚欲裂，遂昏去，少頃又醒，則又受刑。聞曾有連受七八次者，即幸而免死，亦從此牙齒皆搖動，神經亦變鈍，不能復原。前年紀念愛迪生，許多人贊頌電報電話之有利於人，却沒有想到同是一電，而有人得到這樣的大害，福人用電氣療病，美容，而苦人却以此喪命，受苦也。</p>
<p>别國用火藥製彈子禦敵，中國却用　做爆竹敬神；别國用羅盤針航海，中國却用他看風水：别國用鴉片醫病，中國却拿來當飯喫。同一東西，中西用法之不同有如此，蓋不但電氣而已。</p>

<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>天韵樓，人間的伊甸園。</p>
<p>昏夜，走上天韵樓的最高層，展開怎樣一個世界：黝黑的穹窿，低蓋在上頭，靜穆，幽深，不可捉摸，繁星在那里䀹眼睛；新月初上，薄靄朦朧，矗立的大建築被着一層輕綃；遠處近處，紅的綠的紫的黃的燈流交織成爲一片彩色的光網；南京路上的車聲人聲，因風吹送，渲染爲和諧的樂曲，和光波相呼應；這是一個莊嚴肅穆的境界，創世紀裏的伊甸園。</p>
<p>伊甸園中，一羣裸體的亞當，脫下紳士，市民，知識分子，正人君子，的道袍禮服，一絲不掛地在那裏追逐；兩頰是紅紅的，眼流是凝注的，心頭的血是沸騰的，在那裏追逐他們的夏娃。那一羣夏娃，也裸了全身，一絲不掛地在那里追逐；嘴唇那麽樣的紅，臂膊那麽樣的柔滑，眼睛那麽樣的流動，在那裏追逐她們的亞當。</p>
<p>撒旦在樓梯邊等待着；夏娃吃了禁果，亞當跟着也吃了禁果，於是撒旦在樓梯邊笑了！</p>

<p>— 程一戎</p>
<p>我又到了上海。</p>
<p>上海這地方在我以前是作爲自己的第二故鄉的。在這裏，我曾留下了多少生活的血跡，在這裏，我也曾做了許多次美麗的夢。但從我去杭州之後，一别就是兩年了，兩年來，上海的清晰的容貌已經跳出了我的記憶而變成爲非常糢糊的輪廊。我不復能記憶那些專門爲尋歡作樂而生活的富人的狂舞高歌，我也忘記了那些在街頭徘徊的窮愁漢的悽慘的嘆息，那少女們的媚態，那苦力們的血汗，那奢華，那妖淫，那混亂，那擁擠，我都忘記了，我忘記了一切。</p>
<p>這次在大雪中，火車又載我來到了上海，跳下火車，慘淡的戰跡首先就跳進我的眼簾，我向和我同行的×先生說：</p>
<p>「看，那牆上的戰跡。」</p>
<p>「一年多了哪。」</p>
<p>一年多了啊，這話尖銳的剌到我的心，我惘然了。怱怱的走出了車站，走到了街上，街上和車站裏一樣的擠滿了人，來的去的，來的去的。路中心則走着一陣一陣的嶄新的汽車，「波」「波」的響着，吓退了許多許多胆小的行路人。</p>
<p>從人羣鑽進去，又從人羣中穿出來，於是我又到了上海，我和上海又重見了面。</p>
<p>走不完的人羣，走不完的汽車。看不盡的那一切花花綠綠的在路旁樹窗裏陳列着的商品，一切都還是一樣，高大洋房，長長的市招，妖媚的眼睛，流氓的面孔，音樂，跳舞，春宮，影戲，强盜，扒手，自殺，跳黃浦，鴉片的臭味，酒醉漢的狂態，……。一切還是一樣，這便是上海，這也便是罪惡的淵藪。</p>
<p>雖然一切都已經跳出了記憶，忘記得干干凈凈，可是讀熟過了的句子，縱是時間隔得很久很久，但當再重見到那文章時，還是會和以前一般的順口的，於是我在心裏温習了一下，現在的上海和二年前的並沒有兩樣哪。呵，好一個奢侈，淫亂，享樂，逍遙，混合成這樣一個龐雜的社會。</p>
<h3 id="c227">細雨濕流光 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— 每戡</p>
<p>清晨下着濛濛的細雨，時間的輪又轉到春了。</p>
<p>然而，殘冬遺留下來的寒冷依然未去，看不見嫰綠的芳草和剛在發芽的楊柳。春，在塵俗的都市裏，還了無消息。只有公寓老闆所豢養的那隻黑色的雌猫，當天氣驟暖的昨天，忽然爬上屋頂自個兒在呌着呌着，我由這「猫兒呌春」的聲息中，才感覺到春是確實已經到來。可是，今天下了微雨，連這樣一點點兒的春意也消失掉了。</p>
<p>天氣正在轉變着，這便是我最倒霉的時期，全身骨節都會得發痛，尤其是夜裏。</p>
<p>春天，初春的雨天，確是最會惹人煩悶的。時間才挨到了廢曆的元宵，人的煩悶却已和春深時的一樣深沉。想起元宵前後的故鄉，該還是頗熱閙的罷，雖說舊曆早已被「革命」了。</p>
<p>在孩提時，正月是最快樂的時光，自從元旦那天起，穿着新衣服，一直到月底家塾開學時才換去。這一個月中，大人們忙着賭博，小孩子們便忙着放鞭炮，看村戲。</p>
<p>我記得我小時並不是一個怎樣良善的孩子。有一次，那時我剛只有七歲，元宵那一天在鄰家跟着一些大人們賭錢，結果把爸爸在除夕給我的一元「壓歲錢」也輸掉了，心裏十分着急，只怕給爸爸知道了會挨駡，甚至還要挨打。但又不敢不回家來。果然，下午被媽媽發見我的壓歲錢沒有了，媽媽逼問我，我只得扯謊，說早晨靠在庭前的荷花塢上看魚兒游泳，不知不覺地由口袋溜到水中去了。媽媽是很相信我的，和普天之下所有的慈母相信她自己的孩子是善良的孩子一樣地信任着我的話，連忙親自拿火鉗子向荷花塢裏探尋，那時我的内心却已受了譴罰！</p>
<p>爸爸和一般的爸爸差不多，是比母親精明而又有果斷的，他已看出我的破綻，終於擺出「嚴父」所應有的神氣，逼着我招。自然，結果是照實供出。爸爸生了氣，要打我，我正想趁機一逃了之，但我的手却早被爸爸拉住，我哭了，幸虧媽媽替我討了情，終得免去一頓打。</p>
<p>這樣的事，現在想起來只有惘然，仁慈的媽媽雖健在，愛我的爸爸却已於十八年前去世了。我自己的童心也不知消失到那兒去了。華年水逝，兒時的歡樂已不可復得，流光只無聲無息地逝過去，逝過去，一覺醒來，已是二十七歳的人了。一個人若享壽六十，當然算不得是夭折。照這樣的數目推算，也已過了半生；然而這半生曾獲得些什麽呢？</p>
<p>唉！流光只是在無邊的細雨中逝過去，無聲無息地。</p>
<h3 id="c228">黑女求神記 <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— 蕭伯訥作宜譯</p>
<p>然而當她旣經敎了那黑女孩子讀習，在她的生日給與她一本　書的時候，她大約是冒失了。爲什麽呢？因爲當那很認眞地接受着她那敎師的答案的黑女孩子拿了她的「諾勃凱黎」（註）大踏步進向亞非利加森林去尋神的時候，她隨帶了那本聖書，當作旅行指南。　　（註）南亞非利加土人用作投擲武器的短棍棒，一端有着圓塊。</p>
<p>她所遇到的第一個東西是一條「猛白蛇」那會攻擊橫過的人類的少數的毒蛇之一。原來那敎十，因爲諸動物親切而且從未問過什麽問題的緣故，是喜歡畜養動物的，她曾經敎過那黑女孩子，如果她能夠抑制的話，那就不可弄死什麽東西，而且不可害怕什麽東西。因此她將她的「諾勃凱黎」略略揑緊了些，便對「猛白」說道，「不知道造你的是誰呀！他爲什麽給了你要來殺我這意志以及用以這麽幹的毒液的。」</p>
<p>那「猛白」立卽扭一扭頭，指點她跟在牠後面，引導她到一堆岩石邊，在那一堆岩石上高坐着貴族模樣的魁偉的白人，他有着清秀端正的相貌，一部莊嚴的鬍子和濃盛的鬈髮；這兩者都白得同雲母一樣，又有着無情模樣嚴肅的表情。他手裏有着一枝杖，這似乎是王笏，大棒　大「亞綏迦」（註）的集體：用了這，他立卽將那恭順地崇敬地向他移近的「猛白」殺</p>
<p>了。</p>
<p>（註）南亞非利加土人所用的一種輕槍。</p>
<p>旣經受了不可怕什麽這一種敎訓的黑女孩子覺得自己的心對他硬起來了，一則因爲她以爲强健的男子應當是黑的，只有敎會的女士們纔白，再則因爲他將她的友人，那一條蛇栽了，三則因爲他穿着可笑的白睡衣，就此使她回想到她的敎師未能感化她的一點，這就是以她的本身爲可羞而穿短裙的義務。當她向他說話的時候，她的聲音裏有着一種輕蔑。</p>
<p>「我尋着神，」她說。「你可能指引我麽？」</p>
<p>「你是見到他了，」他回答。「此刻跪下來，拜我一拜罷，你這傲慢的傢伙。否則，當心我發怒罷。我是萬軍的主；我造了天地，以及其間的一切。我造了蛇的毒以及你母親的，乳房裏的乳汁。在我的手裏是死和一切的疾病，雷和電，風暴和瘟疫，以及其他一切我的偉大和威嚴的證據。跪罷，女孩子呵；下回你到我跟前來的時候，就將你的寳愛的孩子帶到這裏來，在我的面前，當作犧牲殺掉牠；因爲我愛的是初濺的血的氣息。，」</p>
<p>「我沒有孩子，」黑女孩子說。「我是處女。」（二）</p>

<p>㈥革命與孔子</p>
<p>予旣見有孔子與戲劇其書行世矣，乃述革命與孔子一書，大抵皆錄自「國民革命」以來各級政府與黨部以及革命同志對於孔子問題發表之公私文書而成，（不錄個人對於此一問題之專門論著。）全書近十萬言，篇目如次：</p>
<p>甲·關於孔子祀典與孔子紀念者。</p>
<p>乙·關於孔廟及其財産保管處分者。</p>
<p>丙·關於曲阜孔廟被燬及其修復者。</p>
<p>丁·關於孔族特殊待遇問題者。</p>
<p>戊·關於學校讀經者。</p>
<p>己·關於各種衛道團體者。</p>
<p>庚·關於「辱孔事件」丨卽「子見南子事件」者。</p>
<p>自清季以來，孔敎是否與現代政治相容，卽成爲一大問題。守舊派葉德輝之流攻擊維新派，以康梁爲孔敎叛徒，有翼敎叢編之作。維新派康有爲亦倡三保（保敎保種保國）之說，且以孔子降生紀年。革命派（或稱同盟會派）章太炎先生，則倡言孔敎與革命不相容，力排孔敎：</p>
<p>「我們中國的宗敎丨孔敎，原有好到極處的：就是各種宗敎都有神秘難知的話雜在裏頭，惟有孔敎還算乾凈。但他也有極壞的：因爲孔子當時原是貴族用事的時代，一班平民是沒有官做的，孔子心裏要與貴族競爭，就敎化起三千子弟，使他成就做官的材料。從此以後，果然平民有官做了。但孔子最是膽小，雖要與貴族競爭，却不敢去聯合平民，推翻貴族政體。他在春秋上雖有「非世卿」的話，只是口誅筆伐，並不敢實行的。所以他敎弟子，總是依人作嫁，最上是帝師王佐的資格，總不敢覬覦帝位；及到最下一級，便是委吏乘田也將就去做了。諸君看孔子生平，當他攝行相事的時候，祇是依傍魯君。到得七十二國周遊數次，日暮途窮，回家養老，那時並且依傍季氏，他的志氣豈不是日短一日麽？所以孔敎最大的汚點，是使人不脫富貴利祿的思想。自漢武帝專尊孔敎以後，這熱中於富貴利祿的人總是日多一日。我們今日想要實行革命，提倡民權，若夾雜一點富貴利祿的心，就像微蟲徽菌，可以殘害全身，所以孔敎是斷不可用的。」丨民執第六號，太炎演說錄。</p>
<p>章太炎先生在三十年前實不愧爲一思想比較進步之革命家，且於後來所謂革命偉人假孔敎而腐化，亦實具有先見。嗚呼！予生也晚，今猶未獲親承章先生之　欬。倘若予之「革命與孔子」一書出世，而章先生有機會見之，未知其作何感觸也。</p>

<p>目前世界失業問題的嚴重，是無可諱言的事實，像我們這班旣無做官的親戚，又無買辦階級的朋友，那當然多應當挨餓或受苦的了，就是僥倖給我們謀到一塊噉飯地，也得時常受到上司丨不，上司的妻舅或其他親戚的氣。這班上司的親戚，就是我們平時稱爲「穿黃緞馬褂者」，也就是我們所謂「大王好見」</p>

<p>一旦才智足可獨謀其他職位的時候，就立即設法脫此「牢籠」了，</p>
<p>可是「小鬼」並不充斥在一處或某一機關，而充斥在全中國吧？（因爲外國人辦事，沒有像中國人喜用自己的親戚）他們的勢力實在不小。這實在是中國全國的社會問題。同時也是中國事業辦不好的一大原因。</p>
<p>他們於社會間的勢力旣是這樣大，而於國家爲害又是那樣巨，我們實在不能不給他們一個特别的階級。英國著名政治家伯克，嘗謂皇族是第一階級，紳士是第二階級，平民是第三階級，新聞記者是第四階級。那末這班「小鬼」，我們就稱他們爲第五階級吧。</p>

<p>— 人聲</p>
<p>近幾月來，因爲在困苦的生活中掙扎，不能不盡量的把腦汁絞着。差不多半年沒有發作的神經衰弱症，這一星期來，它就乘機來和我纏繞不清了。我眞要咒詛人生，厭棄人生！最給我感到痛苦的，就是每夜的失眠，差不多大半夜的時間，要消磨在輾轉反側之中。每次，雖說我極力地鎭靜，摒棄一切思念，定心聽着鐘擺聲，專神默念着在兒時父親敎我的「一，二，三，四：：」自己催眠法，因爲如此或許可以使腦神經入於疲倦而得睡眠。這樣試騐着，有時竟獲得奇效，但有時却不幸得很，愈定心，結果思念愈複雜，血好像泉湧了上來，眼廉子大睜開着，腦子更清醒了，惟一的辦法，只有披衣爬起來，伏在寫字桌子，拿起鋼筆在稿紙上刷刷的畫着。啊，生活的鞭子！慘痛啊！</p>
<p>雖說我的宿舍是在近鄉村的所在。這裏，尤其在夜裏，沒有嘈雜的市聲，亦難得有汽車喇叭的呌囂。在理。這樣一個清幽的地方是極適合我居住的了。但，在這廢歷年頭上，爆竹連續地差不多徹夜燃放着。最起勁的是在這一晚上，而據說這就是元宵之夜，一年一度的燈節呀。晚上，因爲竭力想避免用腦子的事，所以一吃過飯，就到田野間獨自踱步了一個鐘頭，回家後拼命玩着新買回的啞鈴，九點多，就倒上床舖，實在乏力極了，自己想，今晚想必可以安眠了。然而才入於昏迷狀態，就給一個怪響的高升驚醒了：接着大爆竹，大鞭砲，連續地響着，整整地鬧了一個通宵。我，在如此煩噪的環境中，還想睡嗎？眼睛大睜着，開始想起自己到上海來已經週年了。剛到上海時無處可依的狼狽情形，不禁呌我深深地打了兩個寒噤，耳邊户外遠近的砲仗，活像去年今日戰時的機槍大砲之聲。於是，戰時的慘况一幕幕重映在腦膜上。我想，上海人眞好興致啊！身受的巨創，過去還只一年，閘北的慘狀，依然猶在，而他們的生活却好像已到了昇平的氣象，快活過新年了，這話打那裏說起呢？……</p>
<p>心兒不停地跳躍，腦子裏的血，加速度的奔流，户外的鞭砲還是烘烘烈烈的鬧着。就在這一夜裏，我還能睏得着嗎？</p>

<p>說也奇怪，原來是這學期最後的一課，照例是說試題的，所以他們和她們來得是這樣的踴躍，打開全學期的記錄。可是事與願違，敎授偏偏的姗姗其來遲，眼看第一課鐘快下了，而不見敎授的半個影兒。動的烈火在每個靑年男女的内心中燃燒着，他們和她們都不能忍受靜的寂寞了。一時堂上人影散亂，吵聲大任，黑板上粉筆跳舞了。</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我是一爿洋服店裏才滿師的工友，年二十三歲；先父早世，並沒有兄弟姊妹。在我們小的時候，母親一方面送我到小學裏讀書，一方面還替我訂下一門親事。現在她年近六十的老母，看見我已經滿師，爲着家裏沒有人手照應的緣故，要我定期結婚。我怕他老人家心中難過，就答允了；想向老闆預借幾個錢，趕辦這件事。我平時因爲感到自己學識欠缺，想進夜校補習；但是我這爿店裏要做夜工，事實上就不能辦到。我又想另調他店，俾得夜裏空着，去完成我讀書的志願。不過這樣一來，新老闆終比不上舊主人熟識，借錢結婚的事情，就要爲難了。爲了經濟的關係，竟會把「結婚」與「讀書」這兩件不相干的事情，發生連繫，而且發生衝突。</p>
<p>先生，請你代我想一個辦法，使牠們調和起來；旣可盡我孝道，還可成全我讀書的願望。（下略）　王祥和謹上</p>
<p>×　×　×　×</p>
<p>編者按：「借債結婚」，我們向來反對的。但是王君因爲門衰母老的緣故，暫時「借債結婚」，以成全他的孝道，我們也不得不破格贊成。不過結婚以後，王君的負擔就重了，家裏的開支，自然要增加數倍，同時還要設法拔債。我們雖然鄙視拜金主義，也不能不勸王君努力於進欵的增加。同時我們知道洋服店裏工友的進欵，與工作的多少，互相消長；兼做夜工的地方，比單做日工的地方，工資當然優厚。我們勸王君不要作别就之想；儘管照你預定步驟，借錢結婚，繼續在這爿店裏工作；慢慢將所借的債，清理完了。「若要天下太平，除非個個人有飯吃」。至於學識一層，當然也很重要；不過總得讓這個「飯」先生一位。有些人行業落在其中，沒有學問，不能吃飯，那末當然飯與學識，可以混爲一談。有些人，他的職業，根本與學識，並沒有多大的關係，那末學問不過是培養人格。怡性悅情，甚而至於「但供消遣」之用的東西。王君的職業，怕就是這一類罷？所以我們勸你，不必犧牲一部份工作時間，定要去加入夜校；要是對於學識，根本不能忘情，那末就空閒時期，讀讀有益的書報，同樣可以增進智識的。</p>

<p>— 汪仲賢</p>
<p>若華被他的迷湯一灌·未便再去埋怨他，她又去探探女兒的口氣，對幼中的感情如何，黛秋恨恨地道；</p>
<p>「我恨他丨我看見了他的影兒都討厭！我不願意呌他叔父，困爲他是我的仇人，我想駡他，恨不得打他幾下，礙着娘的面子，祗得饒赦他罷！」</p>
<p>若華見女兒如此恨着幼中，生怕她眞的鬧出亂子來，還是從速將她遣嫁了吧，便與幼中商量道；</p>
<p>「黛秋已經十八歲了，她遲早總是别人家人，不如早些許定了親事，姪兒鄭濟平再三的求親，我看這小夥子還不錯，就許了給他吧。」</p>
<p>幼中沈吟了一會道；「女兒是你的，你愛嫁誰就嫁誰，我不便顧問：不過小姐心裏可否願意，須要問她一個明白，免得她將來抱怨。」</p>
<p>若華去問黛秋，黛秋低埀粉頸，一言不發，這是女孩子家着常態，不開口就是默許的暗示。</p>
<p>十一我是什麽人都願意嫁了</p>
<p>若華得了女兒的默許，就去答應濟平，濟平想念了黛秋多時，聽得親事成功，喜得手舞足蹈，立刻改口呌若華丈母娘，若華見濟平才貌雙全，又是親上加親，選中了東牀佳壻，心裏也自高興，敎他趕緊挽一個媒人出來，進行訂婚的手續。</p>
<p>濟平回家吿訴了父母，二老知道黛秋是夏仲南的獨養女兒，娶了她就能獨得一份家財，連忙挽了專做媒人的媒婆去求親，媒人奔走了兩三次，就把聘禮等等都說妥了，　　擇日行聘，濟平正在萬分高興的時候，忽接到一封無頭信，信上寫道：</p>
<p>濟平君：</p>
<p>夏黛秋是我的愛人，忽然被你奪去，我豈能甘心？趁現在尙未訂婚，勸你趕緊中止進行，永息妄想，如執迷不悟，將來定要後悔！先進忠吿，望速回頭！　　　　愛秋謹吿</p>
<p>濟平常在夏家出入，知道黛秋足不出户，那裏會與男子往來？這封信定是有人故意鬧玩笑寫的，他也不給人看，婚事依舊進行，誰知過了兩三天，又有一封信來，語意比前信激烈得多了，他只得拿去與父母商量，父母也說是有人妒忌，恫嚇，置之不理，過了三天，行聘的日期都說定了，濟平又接到一封信，信裏硬綳綳的還附着一顆槍彈，說是再不停止婚事，就要用最後手段對付了，濟平的父母這才着了慌，便决計不敢娶夏家女兒了，旣不要人家，不能再去破壞小姐的名譽，祗得婉言對媒人說，因爲小姐的八字不合，祗擬退還了，但濟平的心裏却反對退婚，他仍在外揚言，願娶黛秋爲室，不怕任何威脅。</p>
<p>媒婆因事敗埀成，得不到好處，心裏很不高興，到夏家說了幾句壞話，若華聽了自然生氣，幼中却冷冷的說道：</p>
<p>「這不能怪鄭家，要怪自己小姐的八字生得不好，小姐是一個硬命，有公婆尅公婆，無公婆尅丈夫，我早就知道不容易配親，如今果然！」</p>
<p>若華聽了也很替女兒憂慮，但是頗怪幼中不該當着媒婆的面說女兒的命硬，因爲她們是走千家的人，如果將這聞名傳揚出去，我的女兒還有誰敢娶她呢？媒婆後去，若華着實埋怨了幼中一頓，幼中不肯認錯，二人竟發生了一塲口角，一夜過後，他們又和好如初，幼中因有要事須到北京去走一趟，明天就動身去了。</p>

<h3 id="c240">一九三三年的恐怖影片 <a href="#c240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— 金摩雲</p>
<p>自「古屋怪人」一類的影片，獲得觀衆的歡迎以後，美國電影界爲迎合這種社會心理，從一九三三年的開端，將努力攝製恐怖影片。現在據我們所知道的，已有四種：第一種，是說的一個越禁的猿猴，在紐約市上大肆猖狂。這是雷電華公司的作品，原名（Ｋing　Ｋoug）。内中的故事，是講一家影片公司，在一個荒島上捉獲一隻巨大的猿猴，就把它運回紐約。那猿猴乘人不備，越禁逃出，將一位女郎綁架而去，躱入紐約最高的一百零二層樓上，後來被人覺察，但因沒法子捉捕它，便派了一隊空軍，從空中把它炸死。</p>
<p>第二種是第一國家公司的作品。其中所描寫的，是一個蠟人博物院裏的院主，因他欲使所製的蠟人畢肖生人，他每晚到騐屍所和墓地竊取屍具，再把他抹上一層蠟，自然十分的生動和活人一個模樣了。後來他遇着一位女郎，面貌酷似古時的一位王后，他想把她謀害，改製蠟人……究竟女郎的生死怎樣，讓我們等待影片開映後看她的結果吧。</p>
<p>第三種是說『從墳墓裏爬出來的木乃伊』故事。故事中叙述古代埃及國有一位高僧，因破戒和一位童貞女發生戀愛，後來童貞女死了，他偷得一本天書。念着那本天書上的咒語，可以使死人復活；可是因他的竊盜案發覺，他便給人家活埋而死那本天書也便和他殉葬。數千年後，有一位靑年探險家，發掘那位高僧的墳墓，取出那本天書。他因爲不知其中的原故，口中念着咒語，忽然高僧的木乃伊活轉來了，把天書奪去。木乃伊復活後，知道他的愛人的靈魂已投胎爲人。他又設法想把女郎弄死，使她的靈魂重復歸入軀殼而復活。</p>
<p>第四種是說一位瘋狂醫生，以野獸的標本製造成人類。這是拍拉蒙公司的作品。故事是取材於韋爾斯（Ｈ，Ｇ，Ｗells）的說The　Island　of　Dr.Moreau.描</p>
<p>寫那位醫生用外科手術製造人類。這是恐怖的又含有科學意味的傑作。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c241">（一）評人生的交響曲 <a href="#c241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>在一個並不十分奇特的故事中，每有可以演出不平凡而含有人生意義的戲劇來，這一影片便是好例。</p>
<p>在這裏叙述一個家境平平的醫生，由於其勤苦努力與父母兄妹的熱烈的期望之下而成爲一個名醫。當然，旣然是一個名醫，於是對於家庭不能不有過重的負擔，於是他得獻勤於一般的富豪者，以滿足父母兄妹的較爲優美的生活需要，雖然能有着仁愛的本性對於貧病者特别關懷，其後，他的老父親偶患重病，雖經他極力救治，終於不起，從此，他便不能再相信自己的本領，决然擯棄他的職業。但是，最後終於受了愛人的鼓舞而重新振作起來，而爲社會盡其所當有責任。</p>
<p>在這樣的故事中，我們所能體會的是人生常有許多令自己不能自信的機會，因之不能不趨於消極，眼望着人們在受着苦痛而自身亦感覺難堪，這樣的矛盾，常會在我們的生活的歷程中存留着。然而我們需要對於自己的信心，因爲這種信心確能增進我們生活的樂趣。同時我們在這裏還可以體悟着，現代社會所給與人生的調侃，我們爲了吃飯不得不向我們所厭惡的人們低頭，當然，這是我們常時可以接觸到的苦楚。其實，也許這便是人生！</p>
<p>如上所述，這劇中的主題是不壞的，而且經過導演相當深刻的運用，以致使我們在走出劇塲之後仍留有深刻的刺激。這種刺激能夠使我們回味到人生的悲哀。同時，我們在這裏可以發現許多得力於導演之處。雖然有些鏡頭的位置，不免平凡，但是其精細之處，仍是不能抹煞的。</p>
<p>其次我們所應注意是便是主角李具杜嘉戴（ＲｉcａｒｄｏＣｏｒｔｅｚ）的表演技能。其前段雖然只是平平，但到後半截充却分的顯出了他的精采。特别是那因矛盾而苦惱的心情，更是生動。女主角愛琳鄧（ＪｒｅｎｒＤｕｎｎｅ）只是平平，不見奇特。然而飾父親的ＧｒｅｇｏｒｙＲｏｔｏｆｆ却是恰到好處，所以使我們知道。每一個好的配角常會使劇中生色不少。</p>
<p>光線收音都很可取，不過對話却嫌過多。佈置很能適合戲情，但是因爲鏡頭不能更好的處置以致使佈置顯得平淡</p>
<p>這是一部很可以看的片子，特别是意義上會使我們對於人生有一種概念的認識。</p>
<h3 id="c242">（二）評回心（Ｒｅｂｏｕｎｄ） <a href="#c242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— 燕南</p>
<p>先提要的說一句，「回心」是一張上乘的片子。至少牠對於素描人生和理想戀愛有極坦白而入情的表現的。本來一般靑年們常常爲了環境的使然，深入戀愛歧途而找不着出路。這片子並不是用譏嘲來敎訓人，牠僅僅用輕描淡寫的手腕，幽默地指示出戀愛應有的軌道。的確這是沉醉於愛河中人所需要的一點認識和領導</p>
<p>本事並不驚人。牠述說着很簡單的五個單戀。甲（男）愛乙（女），而乙却愛着丙（男），丙偏愛丁（女），而丁却又嫁給了戊（男）。於是丙因爲失戀，就娶了乙。蜜月旅行，從新大陸跑到巴黎。很巧丁也在那裏碰見了。丙又打算恢復舊情。不料甲却從中挑撥，打算將乙據爲己有。乙也看出丙的變態，於是打算離婚。後來丙悔悟了自己的錯誤，同乙言歸於好。</p>
<p>這不能算完善的喜劇。我認爲乙丙的行重結合，並不是一件美滿的事。在先乙丙的結合，根本就不是美滿的婚姻。旣又分裂，而劇本上，偏要成全他們，未免就牽强了。</p>
<p>然而這不要緊，我們仍能夠深切明瞭非戀愛結合的無意味。「物必先腐而後蟲生」，如果有第三者加入戀愛的時候，一定先有相當的背景。還有一點，就是一個絕好的情人，不必一定是一個良好的家主婦。這影片中丙之所以棄丁就乙，也就是因爲他認識了這一點。</p>
<p>導演手腕，見長於穿挿和對照。大體上平淡得很。攝影可以說不錯。光線亮得很，還不失美觀。</p>
<p>很特别的，這片子發音的清楚和響亮，是任何片子所不能及的。而且對白　小動作中，我們可以找出有許多有趣的地方來。可惜對白太多一點。</p>
<p>演員中以女郎（乙）伊納克拉爾ＩｎａＣｌａｉｒｅ最好。從始至終，努力的工作。面部的内心表演很難得，别的所謂明星們都平平的稱職而已</p>

<p>— 郭聲宏</p>
<p>最近光陸開映的「樂園情曲」是一部音樂化而又悽艷的英國聲片費了二小時的光陰看完了這一部片子，不過使我們流了幾滴熱淚和共鳴之心而去。</p>
<p>劇情說來很長，現在還是說其大概：有二個英國籍的兄弟，渡洋往羅馬專攻音樂，他們因爲同愛一女郎，但他倆正在進行明爭暗鬥之中，忽然平空跳出意大利王子也愛女郎，結果發生槍殺慘劇。兄弟中有一個身入空門懺悔，「天長地久有時盡，此恨綿綿無絕期」。</p>
<p>當然劇情是多麽的哀怨纒綿，如泣如訴，導演的手腕也很高明，演員方面，約翰史都和休士威廉的表情很有可取之處，女主角瓊穆特的表情因爲是初上鏡頭，（？）所以演來很平平，不過了盡劇中人物的責任而已。</p>
<p>因爲本片是音樂化的片子，所以導演僱一班跳舞女參加，音樂幽揚婉轉，悅耳動聽，背景也很矞皇瑰麗。</p>

<p>我國電影界所用之有聲影機，大家曉得都來自歐美；但自顔鶴鳴及竺清賢，和石世磐三君相繼發明國産聲機後，雖不足以言抵制，可是已有很多公司都已採用了；不過此項有聲影機，純係脫胎於舶來品，抑且牠所用的原料，泰半還是外貨。</p>
<p>現在聽說陳宗桐先生會發明一種純粹國産的有聲影機。陳君是廣東香山人，現任美國無線電社工程師。他目擊我國影界所用之有聲影機，全係仰諸舶來；他爲欲挽塞漏巵計，特在香港集合影界聞人，創設一二光公司，置備研究科學器具，就從事作發明有聲影機的研究。</p>
<p>最近他已成功了一種純粹國産的聲機，定名「美樂風，」試用結果，很是美滿，可在碟上或片上發音；且成本低廉，每具僅五千元左右，較諸外貨，眞不啻霄壤。現在他繼續在工作，增多出品，以便片商採用。我希望牠能到上海來，在不久的將來。</p>

<p>「哦，你不認識我麽？我就是克拉克蓋博。」（好萊塢一位紅星）</p>
<p>那貌醜的女子挿嘴了，「哦，蓋博先生，幸會得很。我丨我葛萊泰嘉寳，這位是我的朋友葛羅利史璜遜。你的朋友是誰？」</p>
<p>「哦，他是傑克柯柏。」</p>
<p>那靦覥的男子對了那貌美的少女說了一聲「幸會」。那少女亦回了一聲「你好」。正當這樣搭訕的當兒，那戴小帽的就推開了貌醜些的女子，搿了那貌美女子的臂膊就往前走，嘴裏說「我領頭，你們跟着走吧。」</p>
<p>行行重行行，那戴小帽的浮滑少年同那美貌的少女在前，靦覥的少年同那貌較醜的女子在後。那貌較醜的女子，時時笑睨她身旁的男子，覺得他相貌的確不差。但那男子却不敢正視，時時他顧。而那美貌的少女，被那討厭的浮滑少年搿住了。很不情願，不時地迴過頭來看那靦覥的少年。</p>
<p>大概是夜半吧，兩位少女回來了。她們住在第九路第四十二街的轉角一家樓上。那兩位少年亦跟了回來。二位少女現在在浴室裏。那年稍長的衣服上盡是泥漿，哭喪着臉說道「我從來沒有過，快活日子，等到我快活些，就跌在陰溝裏了。」</p>
<p>「喂，密麗，這算什麽？一回兒就會好的，快去冲一冲。不過，我總不喜歡這樣，太缺德了。誰呌他們跟了回來的？尤其是那馬克有些下等。他們不會當我們是Ｐｉｃｋ_Ｕｐ（淌牌吧？」</p>
<p>「不過我眞喜歡詹梅，」密麗怪可憐地央求。「他亦喜歡我，你不看見我掉在陰溝裏的時候，他連忙跳下去救我起來嗎？哦，潘琪，你可不要不幹。你算是爲我。昨天孟娜不是說過，要找男子祗要上寬街去散步嗎。現在我們找到男人了，你又不幹了。唉，你替我想想，我眞不容易啊。我們白天做事，晚上冷冷清清地睡覺，難道這樣過一輩子嗎？」</p>
<p>浴室門上的柄搖動了，外面一個女子喊着「三更半夜，誰在浴室裏？」</p>
<p>「是我，孟娜我掉在陰溝裏了，現在洗澡呢？」</p>
<p>「哈哈，原來是你，要是有人問我誰情願跌在陰溝裏，我就說密麗。原來是你，你可快」</p>
<p>些。」說完就走了。</p>
<p>她們一回兒出了浴室，來到密麗的房間裏。裏面點了一只兩個燈芯的煤油火爐，旁邊還有一口柜，放了許多有破痕的杯碟。馬克躺在她的床上吸香烟。詹梅坐在門口和狗玩。密麗奔向詹梅，「我謝謝你，你救了我的命。我終身忘不了你，你要我怎樣，我都肯，我都情願」</p>
<p>。」密麗抓住了詹梅的手就吻。詹梅怪難爲情的縮了手。</p>

<h3 id="e2">Japanese Claim Major Offensive in Rehe Within the Month, Preparing to Present Ultimatum Demanding Rehe Troops Withdraw <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to senior Japanese officials here, the Japanese side is now preparing to present three ultimatums to China within the shortest possible period. The content is to demand that the Chinese government withdraw all troops from Rehe. However, the Chinese authorities fear that they will not be able to accept this request. The Japanese army will enter Rehe no later than the 27th of this month, and a large-scale war is expected to begin around March 1, as March 1 is the [blank]th anniversary of the "Manchukuo." The three ultimatums will be delivered, one by the "Manchukuo" government to Tang Yulin, the chairman of Rehe Province, the second by General Muto, Commander-in-Chief of the Kwantung Army, to Zhang Xueliang, and the third by the Tokyo government to the Chinese government. The content is roughly the same, stating that Rehe is part of Manchukuo, so Chinese troops must withdraw from the area entirely. (Reuters dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Currently, everyone feels that the situation in North China is extremely serious. According to news from Chinese people in the Northeast, large armies are now continuously moving towards the Rehe border. The Japanese here in all circles predict that an offensive will begin within the three days of February 25, 26, and 27, so that even if the attack on Rehe is not completely successful by the anniversary of the establishment of "Manchukuo" on March 1, it will be in progress. Judging from the situation, the Japanese will first demand that the Chinese army withdraw from Rehe before launching an attack. As for the Chinese authorities, they are determined not to yield and have now stationed large armies in Rehe in preparation for resistance. Therefore, the public expects an unprecedented bloodbath in the Far East in the near future. The Japanese have repeatedly stated that the war will not cross the Great Wall, but Chinese newspapers are warning the public that the Japanese have said that the Great Wall is the southern boundary of "Manchukuo." The Japanese intend to seize Suiyuan, Chahar, Gansu, and part of Shanxi, and will not be satisfied with merely occupying Rehe. Their second step will be to make the Yellow River the southern boundary, and it is feared that their aim does not stop there. Chinese newspapers are now urging the government to raise genuine war bonds, which should be purchased by the public, to avoid people collecting scattered sums to buy one or two airplanes or a few steel helmets, which will be of no help. It is also said that President Song intends to raise 20 million yuan here to cover war expenses, and bankers in Tianjin and Beiping are willing to provide 5 million yuan. (Reuters dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese troops attacking Rehe are prepared as five divisions and two brigades. Most of the follow-up troops, three divisions, are already being mobilized. It has been decided to use three routes to attack Rehe. The first route is planned to go directly from Tongliao to Kailu, with the entire five detachments of the Taoliao Army and two brigades of cavalry serving as the attacking force. The second route goes directly from Jinzhou to Chaoyang, with the 6th Division and a mixed brigade, plus more than 4,000 garrison troops, totaling 18,000 people, serving as the main attacking force. The third route goes directly from Suizhong to Lingyuan, with one division serving as the attacking force. We have taken strict precautions and decided to resist. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army has reorganized its military for the invasion of Rehe. The original four divisions stationed in the Northeast have now been increased by three divisions, totaling seven divisions. The plan is to have one division stationed in Liaoning and Changchun, in important areas, to maintain the rear. Another division is stationed along the important railway lines in the Northeast to protect transportation. The remaining five divisions are preparing to invade Rehe. Among them, four divisions serve as the main attacking force for the invasion of Rehe, and one division occupies the front-line positions to contain the movements of our forces in the east. As for Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces, they are guarded by a small number of Korean and Japanese troops, along with puppet troops and police. It is reported that the military deployment is largely completed and they are plotting to act at an opportune moment. Most of the Japanese troops have now been concentrated in Jinzhou, and the puppet army commander Cheng Guorui has arrived in Jin County and will lead more than 7,000 rebel troops to cross Jinxi and open up. It is rumored that the Japanese plan to attack Lingyuan and Chaoyang on the 16th. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>

<p>Japan's Diplomacy Fails in the League of Nations</p>
<p>Financial Circles Suddenly Show Extreme Anxiety</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A foreign wire report on the 15th stated that the Japanese army has decided to begin a general offensive on Rehe on the 27th of this month. Officials here consider this to be an attempt by Japan after the failure of its diplomacy in the League of Nations and are not surprised. Moreover, according to a telegram from Tokyo, since this news was released, the Japanese financial circles have shown a phenomenon of extreme anxiety. Stock exchanges in Tokyo, Osaka, and other places have been closed, which shows that this news has had an adverse impact in Japan. Our country has long expected the Japanese army to invade Rehe and has unanimously resolved to resist. Therefore, if the Japanese army actually carries out the invasion, the central government will strictly order the soldiers guarding the territory to resist to the death and not lose an inch of land. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign news: 1. If Japan continues to attack Rehe, it will be insulting the League of Nations and will decide to violate all the reason of the world and humanity, and carry out its crazy violence to destroy civilization. In this case, our country will, when necessary, recall its ambassador to Japan and break off relations unofficially to engage in resistance and maneuvering. It depends on whether Japan has a determination to repent, and its recent expressions are decisive. 2. The Sino-French-Vietnamese commercial treaty, which was signed in May of the 19th year by the French Minister Plenipotentiary to China and the representatives of our government, has not been implemented to date. The diplomatic authorities received an informal notice from the French side yesterday that the French government is studying this matter and that it is likely to be implemented in the shortest possible time. The Sino-French-Vietnamese commercial treaty, which has been delayed for many years, may be resolved recently. (Dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Judging from the situation, if the Japanese army invades Rehe, diplomacy with Japan will no longer be useful. China seems likely to withdraw its representative stationed in Tokyo. Although the final decision here has not yet been agreed upon, it is generally expected that this move is unavoidable. (Reuters dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Song Ziwen Strongly Denounces Japanese Rumors in Talk with Foreign Correspondents <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Sowing Discord is the Usual Trick of the Japanese</p>
<p>Leaders from All Sides are Willing to Give Their Lives to Defend the Country</p>
<p>(Beiping) Today, President Song met with foreign journalists and clarified some of the Japanese rumors. President Song said, "Recently, the Japanese side has repeatedly spread false reports, saying that some of our generals have harbored disloyal intentions, and that the Japanese side has reached a tacit understanding with so-and-so, so they can obtain Rehe without a fight. All these usual tricks of sowing discord and making grand claims to deceive the world are what the Japanese are good at, and we could have ignored them and waited for the facts to prove them. However, past events are not forgotten, and they can serve as a lesson for the future. Recalling the time when the 19th Route Army fought in Shanghai last year, the Japanese side used the same divisive tactics as today. At that time, the Japanese side claimed that the 19th Route Army had been bribed with 2 million yuan and therefore retreated without a fight, and that the army was a communist army, so the central government sent the 87th and 88th Divisions to disarm the 19th Route Army. In the end, all the rumors had no effect, so they fabricated that the 5th Army and the 19th Route Army were fighting each other. By the time the Shanghai war ended, the soldiers of the 19th Route Army, along with the comrades of the aforementioned armies, had become anti-Japanese heroes and a historical statement of the past, which in turn proved the absurdity of the Japanese side's counter-espionage and sowing discord. I have met with the generals in the front and the important leaders from all walks of life, and I feel that the desire to give their lives to defend the country is a common sentiment. In other words, under the circumstances, there is only one way out: the whole country must be of one mind and sacrifice everything to defend our country. There is no other way out."

<p>United States Expresses Willingness to Cooperate Closely with the League of Nations in Every Way</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Diplomatic circles report that the Committee of Nineteen at its meeting on the 14th has completely passed the recommendations portion of the report, with no revisions other than shortening the deadline for the withdrawal of Japanese troops. The entire report will be collated on the 15th, printed on the 16th, and distributed to the member states. The Assembly has decided to delay the meeting by one day, until next Tuesday (the 21st), so that the representatives of the member states can make a full study. According to diplomatic circles, the report is expected to pass smoothly at the Assembly, and there will be no changes in principle. The Assembly session will last for about four or five days and will close by the weekend. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>The agenda for the League of Nations Assembly is as follows: On the 21st, the chairman will report that the League has made every effort to mediate, but because Japan has not relented, mediation based on treaties and justice has failed. Matsuoka Yosuke will not speak on that day. The meeting will be adjourned for two days to study the advisory proposal, and the Assembly is scheduled to reconvene on the 24th and 25th to vote on the advisory proposal. The Japanese representative will speak at the Assembly session on the 24th and oppose the League of Nations' use of Article 15, paragraph 4. (Hualian News Agency dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) After signing the historical report explaining the reasons for the failure of the League of Nations' Committee of Nineteen to mediate the Sino-Japanese dispute and stipulating future measures, the so-called mediation has apparently come to an end. The Committee of Nineteen's recommendations are based on the original text proposed by the Committee of Nine, which was published to the public in the middle of this week. The main points of the recommendations are that the League of Nations Assembly should appoint a committee to assist in Sino-Japanese negotiations, establish a new autonomous political organization in Manchuria under Chinese sovereignty, and that Japanese troops should withdraw to the South Manchurian Railway area. (Reuters dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The draft report does not stipulate a deadline for the withdrawal of Japanese troops. The deadline for the withdrawal will probably have to be decided by a small committee composed of the signatories to the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, plus Germany and Russia. (National Telegraph dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The British and French representatives on the Committee of Nineteen are paying close attention to the invitation of the United States and Russia. At yesterday's meeting, British representative Eden said that if it could make this recommendation effective, he would like to hear opinions. Therefore, the League of Nations seems likely to determine the intentions of the United States and Russia before the Assembly. However, the participation of the United States and Russia, especially the United States, determines the League of Nations' ability. (Electric News Agency dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations is currently carefully calculating the cooperation of the United States in implementing the recommendations of the Committee of Nineteen. It is reported that the United States' arms embargo memorandum was submitted at the Committee of Nineteen meeting on Tuesday, and most of the half-hour discussion was devoted to discussing the United States' attitude toward the League of Nations' report and recommendations. As for this memorandum, it was urgently telegraphed to the State Department by the United States' representative to the Geneva Disarmament Conference on Sunday. The US government immediately telegraphed a reply, which was then submitted to the Committee of Nineteen yesterday by the League of Nations Secretariat. After the members carefully studied the memorandum and other official documents of the United States, they decided that the League of Nations could obtain the cooperation of the United States. It is reported that on Tuesday night, the news of the adoption of the recommendations by the Committee of Nineteen was informally reported to the US representative, and the US State Department has also received a complete summary of the recommendations, along with an informal suggestion from the League of Nations Secretariat, asking the US State Department to privately and informally indicate whether it agrees with the report and recommendations before the League of Nations Assembly finally passes the report and recommendations, and whether it is willing to cooperate with the League of Nations. People in the League of Nations certainly do not expect the US government to informally express the attitude of the United States before seeing the full text of the report and recommendations. It is heard that two copies of the report have been handed over to the White House mail steamer, which left for the United States tomorrow, to be mailed to the United States. It is now heard that the Committee of Nineteen's decision will postpone the meeting of the League of Nations Assembly, the real work conference, until February 24, one of the main reasons being to give the US government time to express its attitude. It is also heard that each member of the Committee of Nineteen was deeply impressed by Stimson's arms embargo memorandum, which stated that "after extensive investigation and consultation, there may be a situation where all cooperating countries must firmly decide which party is the aggressor." It is believed that this language can be directly applied to the Sino-Japanese dispute. The League of Nations now plans to broadcast the full text of the report by radio on Friday and Saturday. It is heard that the League of Nations Secretariat is asking the US State Department to prepare to receive the broadcast at that time, and will also ask Nanjing, Tokyo, and other related cities to prepare to receive it, because the report and recommendations are 15,000 words long, which can save a lot of electricity costs.

<p>But Still Leaves Room for Reversal Before Assembly</p>
<p>Tokyo Indicates Determination to Ignore</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Committee of Nineteen today replied to Japan in the original text as follows:</p>
<p>"We acknowledge receipt of your letter of February 14, and are grateful for your indication of your government's attitude toward 'Manchukuo.' The letter stated that when the delegation accepted the ten principles contained in Chapter [blank] of the Investigation Commission's report as the basis for resolving the dispute, it wished to apply the words suggested by your delegation to these principles and conclusions regarding events that had already occurred, modifying the scope of the seventh principle. The Committee learned that even if a mediation committee were established, the Japanese representative participating in the mediation would not be prepared to accept the statement in the Investigation Commission's report that maintaining and recognizing the existing organization of Manchuria could not be a satisfactory solution to the Manchurian problem as part of the basis for the work of the mediation committee. In this case, the Committee cannot but consider the Japanese proposal of February 8 as not providing a basis for acceptable mediation procedures. This is what the Committee deeply regrets. The Committee has given detailed consideration to the points contained in the letter, but in this situation, it does not feel that discussing these points can lead to any beneficial results. Before the final meeting of the League of Nations Assembly, the Committee would be willing to study any proposals that your government may wish to make again with the utmost caution, but the Committee firmly believes that your representative will be able to understand that any aggravation of the current situation, even if it does not undermine new efforts at mediation, will inevitably make new efforts at mediation more difficult to undertake."

<p>(Tokyo) A spokesman for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs today declined to comment on the possibility of Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations, but said that if Japan finally decides to withdraw from the League of Nations, it will be after the League of Nations Assembly has passed the report and Japan has issued a declaration of reply, and then the withdrawal will be implemented. (Reuters dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to reports, Japan will not take new steps regarding the League of Nations' Manchuria resolution for the time being. When the full text of the recommendations passed by the League of Nations Assembly is transmitted to Tokyo, the Japanese government will hold an emergency meeting to decide on the attitude to take. Then, Foreign Minister Uchida will report to the Emperor, and Prime Minister Saito will visit Elder Saionji. Then, a meeting of the Elders will be held to decide on the final attitude towards the League of Nations. (Reuters dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Uchida received a telegram from Matsuoka Yosuke today, saying that the League of Nations' compromise plan is hopeless.

<p>(Tokyo) The League of Nations plans to submit the Article 15, paragraph 4 report to Japan. At this critical time when the government is deciding on a major diplomatic policy, it is carefully studying how to handle the report. As a result, it has decided that after receiving the report, it will immediately convene an emergency cabinet meeting to decide on the government's attitude. Then, Prime Minister Saito will personally meet with Elder Saionji to request understanding, and at the same time, he will ask the Emperor to convene a meeting of senior statesmen to explain the government's policy towards the League of Nations. The reason for convening a meeting of senior statesmen this time is that there is a need to clearly distinguish between the palace and the government. The attendees will be limited to the three imperial family members, Prince Kan'in, Chief of Staff of the Army, Prince Fushimi, Chief of Staff of the Navy, and Marshal Nashimoto, as well as the two Marshals Togo and Uehara, Counts Yamamoto Gonnohyoe and Kiyoura Keigo, Seiyukai leader Wakatsuki Reijiro, Finance Minister Takahashi Korekiyo, and Speaker of the Privy Council Kuratomi Yuzaburo, while the three senior palace officials, Interior Minister Makino, Minister of the Imperial Household Iki, and Chamberlain Suzuki, will not be invited.

<p>(Tokyo) There is a rumor that the government will convene a meeting of senior statesmen to discuss countermeasures against the League of Nations, saying that before Japan joined the League of Nations, a meeting of senior statesmen was held, so a similar meeting must be held to withdraw. However, according to news from the government, the withdrawal of the Japanese representative from Geneva has been decided, but the withdrawal from the League of Nations has not yet been implemented.

<p>(Geneva) Today (14th), the meeting of the Nineteen-Member Committee was characterized by complete unanimity. It began with a discussion of the letter from Japan, followed by the drafting of a response. The assembly then discussed the Jehol problem and decided to notify the Japanese representative that any aggravation of the situation would undermine new efforts at mediation. The assembly then passed a proposal with minor, insignificant amendments and supplemented the section on the selection of members for the negotiating committee, deciding that the negotiating committee should be composed of the following representatives:</p>
<p>(1) Members of the Nineteen-Member Committee who volunteer to join. This point was clarified because the negotiations may take place in the Far East, and anyone wishing to participate must be prepared to travel to the Far East to work.</p>
<p>(2) Signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty and Soviet Russia.</p>

<p>The assembly also decided that the meeting of the League of Nations General Assembly on Tuesday should discuss and decide on the conclusion of the mediation. A second meeting will be held three days later to discuss this report. It is expected that the League of Nations General Assembly will also hold a third and final meeting on Saturday.</p>

<p>During today's meeting, Irish representative Lester asked what would happen if one of the parties rejected the proposal. Secretary-General Drummond replied that he believed there should be a three-month grace period, after which a new report would be submitted to the League of Nations General Assembly. However, the point raised by Ireland was unclear, which is why the proposal did not mention a grace period.</p>
<p>Belgian representative Boelcon said that he had spoken with Chinese representative Dr. Yen Hui-ching before the meeting, and Dr. Yen believed that the proposal still had a shortcoming, namely, that it did not specify a deadline. Dr. Yen asked people to pay attention to the need for a deadline.</p>

<p>The assembly believed that the proposal had not yet been submitted to both parties, so their opinions could not be considered immediately. However, it was felt that Irish representative Lester had pointed out a weakness, as the League of Nations Covenant was ambiguous on this point. There is a serious gap here. If Japan ignores the proposal, how will it be dealt with? Article 12 of the League of Nations Covenant only states that member states may not engage in war until three months after the League of Nations General Assembly has submitted a report. Although the majority of the Nineteen-Member Committee believed that the League of Nations could not wash its hands of the matter, no one could say what steps should be taken under the Covenant.</p>

<p>The assembly believed that if negotiations do not materialize, the committee appointed by the League of Nations to monitor the negotiations between the two sides will also serve as an agency to observe the development of the situation. It is reported that invitations will be sent to all members of the Nineteen-Member Committee and the three countries of the Netherlands, the United States, and Russia tonight, so that their replies can be obtained as soon as possible, and the negotiating committee can be organized next Tuesday. The assembly believes that not all members of the Nineteen-Member Committee will accept the invitation, as it is expected that the negotiating location will be in the Far East. Although the door to mediation has not been closed before Tuesday, the assembly believes that Japan will not change its attitude.</p>

<p>Today, the Japanese spokesperson hinted that Matsuoka will make an important gesture when the League of Nations General Assembly holds an open meeting, announcing Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations. However, the general public believes that Japan will not take this drastic action immediately. Japan may wait and see how things develop before deciding on concrete actions. However, when the League of Nations General Assembly meets on Tuesday, the Chinese and Japanese representatives will inevitably make important speeches. At the last meeting of the League of Nations General Assembly, Matsuoka made a big speech because he did not recognize the "Manchukuo" issue. The proposal now explicitly stipulates that "Manchukuo" will not be recognized, which may cause Matsuoka to make another big speech.</p>
<p>Meeting Place Communiqué The League of Nations issued a communiqué tonight, the full text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>The Nineteen-Member Committee met this afternoon and first considered the reply from Japanese Chief Delegate Matsuoka to the Committee regarding the questions asked on February 9. It was agreed that the Secretary-General should reply on behalf of the Committee. The Committee then read and reviewed the first draft of the revised text submitted yesterday and subsequently passed the first three paragraphs of the report. If mediation fails, this report will be submitted to the League of Nations General Assembly in accordance with Section 4 of Article 15 of the Covenant. The Committee then proceeded to the fourth paragraph of the report, namely the first reading of the proposal, which was slightly modified and passed. The General Assembly decided to convene on Tuesday next week. The full text of the League of Nations General Assembly report will be distributed to all members of the League of Nations as soon as it is printed, probably at the end of this week. At the same time, it will be broadcast by the League of Nations radio station via wireless and wire, reaching the government radio stations or telecommunications bureaus of various countries (Reuters dispatch, 14th).</p>

<p>(London) The Japanese Students' Association of the University of London hosted Lord Lytton at a Japanese restaurant in London last night. Many Japanese residents attended the banquet. Lord Lytton delivered a speech at the banquet, stating that he did not believe in resorting to war to enforce peace. The League of Nations can only do one thing, namely, clearly and practically define the scope within which the Sino-Japanese dispute should be resolved, and that it should be in accordance with the obligations of the League of Nations Covenant. To say that the League of Nations can adopt a system of war or reconciliation, or use a "big stick" to force a member state to accept its views, is simply empty talk. Lytton also stated that a solution to the Sino-Japanese dispute can be found within the rules and regulations of the League of Nations Covenant (Reuters dispatch, 15th).</p>
<h3 id="e18">British Economic Circles Are Only Thinking of Themselves <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Avoiding the Use of Article 16</p>
<p>(London) Responsible persons in British economic circles are extremely concerned about the situation in the Far East. What attitude should Britain take once China and Japan formally declare war? This is a matter of great concern to the general public. The hostile actions of China and Japan are in serious violation of the League of Nations Covenant signed by Britain. The British government cannot stand idly by, but it seems that Britain is unwilling to take retaliatory measures against the aggressor or adopt sanctions. What can be believed is that Britain will do its utmost within the scope of the League of Nations. As for implementing sanctions in accordance with Article 16 of the Covenant, this involves a great deal, and the countries concerned must be prepared to cope with any eventuality before it can be realized. It is feared that this level is difficult to achieve. People here believe that even if Japan's crimes are clearly declared in accordance with the provisions of Article 15, it will be enough to make Japan withdraw from the League of Nations, and there is no need to apply the sanctions of Article 16. If Japan withdraws from the League of Nations, Britain can take two paths: either prevent Japan from withdrawing, so as not to reduce the authority of the League of Nations, or allow it to withdraw, and let the League of Nations reduce its scope, because the scope is too large, and the interests are too complicated, and any effective joint action cannot be carried out, and it is better to reduce the scope. As of now, the first method has been regarded as a creed by all except the Liberal Party and the opposition. Although some formal personnel have expressed their support for the second method, the prospect of success is still far away, because the slogan adopted by Britain in international policy in recent years is "striving for mediation" (Havas dispatch, 14th).</p>
<h3 id="e19">Geneva Newspapers' Views on the League of Nations <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The work of the Sino-Japanese dispute in Geneva will now be silent until next Tuesday. The comments made by various Geneva newspapers on the resolution of the Nineteen-Member Committee are extremely different. One side views the resolution to continue negotiations, that is, the disguised "mediation procedure, as evidence of the League of Nations' weakness. The newspapers holding this view said that the League of Nations' universalism now clearly contains dangerous microorganisms, which will endanger the noble ideals that the League of Nations possessed at the time of its establishment. The United States has not joined the League of Nations, and the Soviet system has broken away from the League of Nations and is active, which has limited the League of Nations' power and authority. Now it is urgent to consolidate the Covenant and make a clear and practical interpretation, otherwise it cannot be hoped that the League of Nations will intervene in the dispute and achieve results, regardless of whether the dispute occurs in the Far East or South America. Other newspapers hold the opposite view, saying that the resolution of the League of Nations is a victory for the League of Nations' principles and a great success for small countries. In the first few acts of the dispute, the great powers were extremely unwilling to take any clear stance. Through the struggle of the small countries, they finally dragged them into the same front. The newspaper also believes that when the time is right, more severe actions can be taken, and small countries can still use their power to influence powerful neighbors and achieve victory (Reuters dispatch, 15th).</p>
<h3 id="e20">Cecil Launches Peace Shop <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Opposing the Use of Force to Resolve International Disputes</p>
<p>Japanese Brutality is the Enemy of World Civilization</p>
<p>(London) Former British representative to the League of Nations, Lord Cecil, opened a "Peace Shop" in the Chelsea district of London to promote peace and improve the lives of the unemployed. It officially opened today. Cecil claimed that his purpose was to make the British people feel interested in international events, "and said that the universe is shrinking day by day, and all countries are mutually involved in an inseparable relationship, and the conflict between China and Japan in the Far East is in full swing, but our people are indifferent to it. What we should know about the Far East is not who Manchuria belongs to, but the real question is whether international disputes should be resolved by violence. A strong country in the Far East is now trying to force a weaker nation to submit to its will by force. If this kind of brutality is recognized by the world, it is tantamount to the recurrence of the situation of the European War in 1914 today, and the blood and sweat that mankind has used to seek peace after the European War will all be in vain" (Havas dispatch, 14th).</p>

<h3 id="e21">The Serious Period Has Arrived... National Reflection Yuan <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>The League of Nations has recently suddenly changed its hesitant attitude and resolutely upheld justice. The Nineteen-Member Committee has passed the entire draft report, which can be said to be a major failure for Japanese diplomacy. However, we should not be complacent and relax our spirit of struggle, thinking that diplomacy is helping us, or take advantage of the opportunity of the League of Nations' break with Japan to think that we can hide in a corner and sit back and reap the benefits, or think that Japan will succumb to the pressure of the League of Nations and eventually yield and obey. If we think that our country can be slightly relieved from now on, then we are greatly mistaken.</p>
<p>Although the League of Nations has passed the report in the Nineteen-Member Committee today, it is still unknown whether there will be changes in the General Assembly in the future. Even if there are no changes, it can pass smoothly like the Nineteen-Member Committee. However, after the passage, if the League of Nations does not take further steps to pressure Japan with the sanctions of Article 16 of the Covenant, then the effect of the report is also equal to zero. At present, the atmosphere in the League of Nations seems to be very激昂, but it is still trying to avoid the use of Article 16. Because it is closely related to its own interests and there are many disputes, it has no courage to implement it resolutely. According to yesterday's foreign telegram, the leaders of the League of Nations expect that the pressure applied to Japan will be based on the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, rather than the League of Nations Covenant. On the surface, this can avoid the traces of inviting the United States and Russia to assist in the implementation of pressure. However, the League of Nations is in the main position to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute, but it does not use the Covenant, which is also difficult to understand. Recently, some people have doubted the League of Nations, saying that the Nineteen-Member Committee submitted this report to the General Assembly, and after the General Assembly passed it, it announced it to the world, or it would end it, thinking that the League of Nations had done so, it had exhausted its wisdom and ability, and from then on it would announce a stage. If so, the League of Nations would only use this empty talk of upholding justice to perfunctorily seek a way out. However, our country has lost its land and has not recovered it. Even if a negotiating committee is formed in the future according to the report, and there is no fixed deadline, and it is delayed, not only will it still not be completed, but there will be more complications. Japan is still carrying out its aggression as before. This kind of dangerous situation is by no means unexpected. Our people should urgently consider it.</p>
<p>On the Japanese side, although it has been under great pressure from the League of Nations, its attitude has not changed at all. It is especially determined not to relax on the issue of advancing troops to Jehol. Matsuoka replied to Drummond's advice, saying that Japan did not want to stop its military actions against Jehol. "Manchukuo" is preparing to cooperate with the Japanese army to clear all Chinese troops in Jehol Province, etc. It is obvious that it does not care about the League of Nations at all. Therefore, no matter what its attitude towards the League of Nations is today, cooperating with the puppet organization to capture Jehol is something that will be realized immediately. Whether it withdraws from the League of Nations or not, it will attack Jehol. It is not afraid of the League of Nations Covenant, and it does not care about the Nine-Power Treaty, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and all international laws. Recently, the reason why it has not moved its troops against Jehol is that it still wants to observe the situation of the League of Nations and use its means of colluding and provoking to hope to achieve some effects, help its prestige, and satisfy its greater desires. Now that it has no hope for the League of Nations, it can only simply abandon its diplomatic strategy of纵横捭阖 and devote itself to military force. Everything is free to act on its own. The diplomatic drama of the international community for a year and a half is over, and the main act of military force begins from it. May I ask who is the protagonist of this military drama, the one who fiercely fights in our country? And who is the opponent who fights against him? If we do not fight desperately, who can help me? After the failure, what position will I take? These are all things that our people should reflect on.</p>
<p>We discussed yesterday that after the fourth item of Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant is carried out, we have encouraged our people to make the efforts they should make in the future. The reason why we are repeatedly nagging today is that the general public still regards this new situation of the League of Nations as beneficial to us, and they are happy and comforted, and the idea of stealing peace is reborn. They do not know that under this new situation, not only can they not steal peace, but they should also work hard to rise up. Not only has the national crisis not been slightly alleviated, but it is also increasingly forced into a serious juncture. The government strictly rectifies military preparations, and all generals unite and concentrate their strength to resist this violent and strong enemy. At this time, all the people of our country should mobilize all their manpower, financial resources, and material resources to fight for the survival of our nation. Today, the North China Daily News commented on this matter, saying that the opportunity for Chinese people to help themselves has arrived. The League of Nations' advocacy of justice is only a moral victory, and success must be achieved by the entire Chinese people. Friendly countries hope that our public opinion is still like this. Why do our people stand by and not urgently seek to save themselves? The situation in Jehol is now extremely critical. May our people wake up quickly.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Full Text of the Proposal <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The proposal of the nine-member sub-committee was distributed to the Nineteen-Member Committee in its final form today. The text currently released differs from the excerpt telegraphed abroad on the 12th of this month only in the arrangement of words and sentences. However, the full text contains many citations. Apart from the citations, the full text is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Chapter 1 Cites Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant, Article 2 of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and Article 1 of the Nine-Power Treaty, and states that the League of Nations General Assembly passed the principles announced by Briand on December 10. It also states that the Administrative Council's 12th Committee invoked this principle on February 16, 1932, advising the Japanese government and declaring that any destruction of the territorial integrity of a member state of the League of Nations and changes in its political independence caused by contempt for Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant should not be recognized by the members of the League of Nations.</p>
<p>The proposal then states that in order to establish a permanent understanding between China and Japan based on the above-mentioned international agreements, the resolution of the Sino-Japanese conflict must be in accordance with the following conditions of the fact-finding mission, namely the ten principles in the Lytton Report: (1) Suitable for the interests of both China and Japan, (2) Considering the interests of Soviet Russia, (3) Observing the existing treaties on all sides, (4) Recognizing Japan's interests in Manchuria, (5) Establishing new treaty relations between China and Japan, (6) Practically stipulating methods for resolving future disputes, (7) Autonomy in Manchuria (8) Internal order and security from external aggression, (9) Promoting economic coordination between China and Japan, (10) Promoting China's construction through international cooperation,</p>
<p>Chapter 2</p>
<p>Section 1 Since sovereignty over Manchuria belongs to China, the League of Nations General Assembly recommends that an agency be established in Manchuria at an appropriate time under Chinese sovereignty and suitable for the integrity of Chinese administration, endowed with extensive autonomy, and should meet legal conditions and take into account Japan's special rights, existing multilateral treaties, the rights of third parties, and the general principles and conditions contained in Chapter 1. The decision on the powers and relationship between the Chinese central government and local authorities shall be announced by the Chinese government and have international effect.</p>
<p>Section 2 The stationing of Japanese troops outside the South Manchurian Railway area is contrary to the legal principles that must be observed for resolving disputes. Therefore, the League of Nations General Assembly recommends the withdrawal of these troops.</p>
<p>The primary objective of the negotiations proposed hereinafter shall be to handle the withdrawal of troops and to decide on the conditions, stages, and deadlines for the withdrawal.</p>
<p>Section 3 In addition to the issues addressed in the above two proposals, the fact-finding mission's report mentions several other issues that hinder the good understanding between China and Japan, which is crucial for peace in the Far East. Therefore, the League of Nations General Assembly recommends that both parties resolve these issues based on the above-mentioned principles and conditions contained in the fact-finding mission's report.</p>
<p>Section 4 Negotiations necessary to implement the above proposals should be implemented, and neither party should propose conditions that are not suitable for the above proposals. Therefore, the League of Nations General Assembly recommends that both parties begin negotiations in accordance with the method prescribed below.</p>
<p>Please notify the Secretary-General whether each of the two parties accepts the solution proposed by the League of Nations General Assembly on the sole condition that the other party also accepts this solution. The negotiations will be held with the assistance of a committee formed by the League of Nations General Assembly in accordance with the following regulations.</p>
<p>The members of this committee are the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty and any members of the Nineteen-Member Committee who declare their willingness to join. As soon as the Secretary-General declares that both parties have accepted the recommendations of the League of Nations General Assembly, he will appoint representatives.</p>
<p>The Secretary-General must also notify the United States and Russia, informing them of the acceptance of the recommendations by both parties and inviting them to send representatives to join this committee. Within one month after receiving the notification of acceptance of the recommendations from both parties, the Secretary-General must take all appropriate steps to begin negotiations. In order for the members of the League of Nations to judge whether either party is acting in accordance with the recommendations after the negotiations have begun (A) This committee should report on the progress of the negotiations, especially the negotiations on the implementation of the above-mentioned Sections 1 and 2, and in any case, it must report on the progress of Section 2 within three months after the start of the negotiations. All such reports must be sent to the League of Nations by the Secretary-General. (B) This committee may submit questions regarding the interpretation of Chapter 2 to the League of Nations General Assembly.</p>
<p>The League of Nations General Assembly must interpret this report under the same conditions as it was established in accordance with Section 10 of Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 The solution currently proposed differs from the mere restoration of the original state before September 1931, and it does not allow the maintenance and recognition of the current state of Manchuria, because this kind of maintenance and recognition is not suitable for the basic principles of existing international obligations and is contrary to the good understanding between China and Japan, which is crucial for peace in the Far East.</p>
<p>When the members of the League of Nations pass this report, they must not take any actions that may hinder the implementation of the recommendations in this report or delay their application.</p>
<p>Member states will continue not to recognize the current state of Manchuria legally or in fact. Member states do not want to take any individual actions regarding the situation in Manchuria and want to cooperate with each other and, when possible, take the same actions and attitudes as non-member states concerned.</p>
<p>In addition, the members of the League of Nations who are signatories to the Nine-Power Treaty have promised that whenever a situation arises that, in the opinion of any signatory country, involves the application of the provisions of the Nine-Power Treaty and makes the discussion of this application appropriate, there must be full and frank contact between the signatory countries concerned.</p>
<p>In order to establish a situation in the Far East in accordance with the conclusions of this report to the extent possible, the Secretary-General is instructed to send a copy of this report to all countries that are not members of the League of Nations but are signatories to the Nine-Power Treaty or the Kellogg-Briand Pact, informing them of the League of Nations General Assembly's hope that they will endorse the views expressed in this report and take the same actions and attitudes as the members of the League of Nations when necessary (Reuters dispatch, 15th).</p>

<p>Imports to Japan Exceed Those to China</p>
<p>(London) Today, the British Ministry of Commerce released figures for Britain's arms trade with the Far East in 1932, showing that Japan purchased far more than China. Only in the item of small arms ammunition did China exceed Japan. The total number shipped to China was 7,735,000 rounds (excluding those shipped to Hong Kong, Macau, and leased territories). The total number shipped to Japan was 5,361,450 rounds. As for high explosives, Japan purchased a total of 490,900 rounds, while China purchased only 278,800 rounds, only half of Japan's. As for other explosives and bullets, those shipped to China were worth £1,463, while those shipped to Japan were worth £40,239, a much larger difference. As for other naval and military supplies, those purchased by Japan were worth £11,160, while those purchased by China were worth only £7,778 (National Telegraph dispatch, 15th).</p>

<p>Stock Prices Plunge</p>
<p>Stock Exchanges Suspend Trading</p>
<p>Public Sentiment Shaken, Rumors Abound</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Tokyo and Osaka stock exchanges suspended trading this afternoon due to the reactionary situation in Geneva and the sharp drop in the prices of various stocks (Reuters dispatch, 15th).</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Due to the situation between Japan and the League of Nations falling into a final break, the Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka, and other major stock exchanges saw a sharp decline in the prices of various stocks in the morning session. As a result, the opening of the stock market in the afternoon session was postponed. It is reported that the Osaka Stock Exchange has decided to suspend trading temporarily. The Tokyo and Nagoya stock exchanges also stopped trading as soon as they opened. Public sentiment in the six major cities is shaken, and there are widespread rumors in the market that Japan will be subject to an economic blockade by the League of Nations after it withdraws from the League of Nations, and it is also rumored that the Japanese military will decide to declare war on China, and a Japanese-American war is inevitable. It is also said that Japanese and Russian troops have clashed somewhere, etc. The whole country is crazy, and rumors are rampant. Although the police security bureau is doing its best to crack down on rumors, it is not effective at all. It is expected that the Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya stock exchanges will not be able to open tomorrow morning. The inflationary boom has also left no trace of the so-called prosperous market due to the unfavorable situation of the League of Nations for Japan. The stocks that have fallen the most are those on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, among which the highest-priced stocks have fallen by about 81 yuan per share compared to the beginning of this spring. Kanebo Spinning has fallen by about 84 yuan, Japan Industries has fallen by 48 yuan, Nichiro Fisheries has fallen by more than 34 yuan, Oji Paper has fallen by about 22 yuan, and Nippon Yusen has fallen by about 11 yuan. It can be said that it is an unprecedented chaos since the founding of the stock exchange (China United Press dispatch, 15th).</p>

<p>(Beiping) More than 1,000 members of the First and Second Branches of the Jing Zhenzhou Department of the Overseas Chinese National Guard ambushed Xinchengzi Station on the South Manchurian Railway on the night of the 9th, and came into contact with the puppet public security detachment and the Japanese train escort police. They disarmed the entire detachment. They then advanced to the Japanese police station, where more than 100 Japanese troops stationed at the station rushed to the scene. After three hours of fierce fighting, our troops, fearing that enemy reinforcements would arrive, withdrew in different directions. A total of 52 rifles of various sizes and more than 470 rounds of ammunition were seized. Our troops suffered seven casualties (Special dispatch, 15th).</p>

<p>(Beiping) The Tianjin Mint has been closed for several years. Recently, the Japanese mistakenly heard rumors that the factory would be transformed to manufacture guns and cannons, and took the opportunity to claim that in the 13th year of the Republic of China (1924), the provincial government borrowed 300,000 yuan from a certain stock company using the factory's machinery and property as collateral, with an annual interest rate of 7%. More than 100,000 yuan has been repaid since then, and the principal and interest now amount to more than 400,000 yuan. The Japanese consulate sent a letter to the provincial government, limiting the repayment of the debt within two weeks. If the deadline is exceeded, Japanese soldiers will be asked to occupy the factory. The factory director, Li Yichun, is currently negotiating with the Japanese to repay the debt in installments. The Japanese have not yet agreed (Special dispatch, 15th).</p>

<p>Beiping Finance Committee Holds Meeting</p>
<p>Yu Xuezhong Summoned to Beiping</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Ziwen in Beiping asked the banking industry to assist with military expenses in North China. Because the issue was significant, Bian Baimei and others came to Tianjin on the 15th to seek opinions from over a thousand peers before responding. Song sent a telegram to Tianjin, summoning provincial chairman Yu Xuezhong and finance director Lu Muting to Beiping to inquire about the financial situation of Hebei Province and to explore new tax measures. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) In recent days, Song Ziwen has been in contact with the banking industry in Beiping and Tianjin regarding financial problems in North China. They all felt that financial stagnation and limited economic strength in Beiping and Tianjin in recent years made it difficult to bear excessive amounts. Yesterday's further discussions still yielded no results. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Representatives from the Tianjin banking community, including Bian Baimei, returned to Tianjin last night and will discuss the matter in detail with various banks in Tianjin. Song will return to Nanjing after financial issues are properly negotiated. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan was summoned to Beiping and today paid separate visits to Zhang and Song for discussions. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Jiang Bocheng visited Song Ziwen this morning for half an hour. Jiang will go to Jinan in two or three days to handle party affairs. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Ziwen stated that the Central Government can provide sustenance, ensuring that all troops in North China can be fed. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Finance Committee held a meeting at the Diplomatic Building this afternoon. Zhang Xueliang, Song Ziwen, Yu Xuezhong, and others attended. Song Ziwen chaired the meeting, discussing measures for financial relief in North China. They discussed in detail the issuance of 20 million in national salvation public bonds and the restructuring of North China's finances. Song intends to take the opportunity to formulate concrete measures for North China's finances, adhering to the principle of openness. Zhang hosted a banquet at Prince Shuncheng's residence this afternoon for French minister Wilden and seven others. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yu Xuezhong came to Beiping this afternoon to discuss attending the Finance Committee meeting. Tianjin is peaceful, and provincial administration and all construction projects are proceeding as usual. The front line at the Shi River is quiet. If the Japanese attack Rehe, Luandong will inevitably be subject to a sudden strike, but the time is not yet ripe. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Jiang telegraphed Song Ziwen, stating that antiques transported south should be temporarily kept in Nanjing for preservation and that suitable housing has been found at the Lizhi Society. (15th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Shenyang states that after the Japanese dismissed Xi Qia, the puppet governor of Jilin Province, the Japanese recently further forced Puyi to dismiss all individuals deemed unsuitable by the Japanese. Zang Shiyi, the puppet governor of Fengtian Province, originally concurrently served as the puppet Central Minister of Civil Affairs. The Japanese, citing the busy nature of the Minister of Civil Affairs post, removed Zang from his position as provincial governor, ordering Zang to serve solely as the Minister of Civil Affairs, residing in the puppet ministry and not allowed to go elsewhere. This puppet order is expected to be announced within a day or two. It is rumored that Zhao Pengdi, the puppet director of civil affairs of Liaoning, is the most likely successor. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e29">Whether to Renew the Sino-Japanese Reciprocal Trade Treaty Remains Undecided <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Dependent on Whether Japan Can Change Its Attitude</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Sino-Japanese Reciprocal Trade Treaty expires on May 6 this year. The foreign and finance ministries are constantly receiving telegrams from various groups or individuals urging the cessation of renewal. The two ministries are currently consulting on the matter. Whether to continue the treaty has not yet been decided. Because there are still more than two months until the expiration date, during this period, the standard for whether or not to renew the treaty will depend on whether Japan can abandon its policy of aggression against China. Proof of Japan's attitude can be seen in the upcoming League of Nations special assembly. Because the committee of nine drafting members has already decided that the right to the territory of Northeast China belongs to China, which will be submitted to the General Assembly for discussion. If Japan can change its face of violating world justice and relying on force, and return the land of Northeast China to China, then this will be clear proof that it has abandoned its aggression. If it still insists on its past claims, it will prove that its aggression against China has not changed. It seems there is no need to renew the Sino-Japanese trade treaty. (15th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Chinese National Diplomatic Association, considering the urgency of the national crisis, finds it extremely hateful that some Chinese people have forgotten righteousness for profit, willingly become traitors and dogs of the enemy, and alienated themselves from the Chinese nation. If strict sanctions are not imposed, there will be no way to deter future actions. It has been decided to telegraph local officials and public groups throughout the country to investigate the names of traitors. Once factual evidence is collected, it will be compiled into a booklet and distributed to compatriots across the country for unanimous repudiation. Furthermore, the atrocities committed by the Japanese invaders against the Chinese people and the names of the victims since the September 18th Northeast Incident will also be thoroughly investigated.

<p>(Nanjing) According to a report from the Bengbu Telegraph Bureau to the Ministry of Communications, the wireless radio station established by the Anhui Construction Department in Bengbu is nominally for relaying telegrams between the provincial government's various departments, but in reality, it openly seizes commercial telegrams at half price, resulting in reduced revenue for the bureau and making it difficult to maintain.

<p>(Nanjing) After the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union, the signing of a trade treaty between the two countries is urgently needed. Since Soviet foreign trade is generally state-run, it is urgently necessary to determine whether China's trade with the Soviet Union should also be the same, in order to lay the foundation for the negotiation of the treaty. The Department of Commerce of the Ministry of Industry is currently studying this together with the Trade Treaty Review Committee. On the 15th, the ministry also consulted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to copy and send one copy each of the trade treaties signed by the Soviet Union with the four countries of Britain, Japan, Germany, and France for reference. After the ministry has a considerable result of the research, it will invite the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Finance to discuss the matter further. According to the opinion of a certain businessman, Soviet foreign trade is all state-run, while China is a free trade country. At this time, it is difficult to implement state-run operations both theoretically and practically. The purpose of state-run operations is to adjust the surplus and deficit of production and sales and to determine appropriate prices. Currently, there is no detailed investigation of various products in China. It is not known which are surplus and which are lacking, nor is it known how much is surplus or lacking. Under these circumstances, prices cannot be determined. At the same time, other countries besides the Soviet Union freely import goods, so it is difficult to talk about adjusting surpluses and deficits. (15th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Banks Across the Country Rush to Supply Cash by Plane and Train</p>
<p>Reuters, Detroit, 14th - After Michigan Governor Comstock consulted with bankers and bank officials of the state overnight, he suddenly announced this morning that all banks in the state would be closed for eight days, from today until February 21st. During this period, all banks, trust companies, and financial institutions will cease operations. This is an unprecedented move in the history of Michigan. The governor stated in his announcement that this was necessary due to the state's current financial emergency. The stock exchange here is also currently closed.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Detroit, 14th - Today, the Union Guardian Trust Company here, due to insufficient cash to meet withdrawals from depositors and interest payments on loans from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC), with the consent of Governor Comstock and the Department of Commerce and the Treasury Department, ordered a temporary suspension of payments in Michigan for one week. All 420 state banks, 120 national banks, and the Detroit Stock Exchange in the state were closed, and the financial world turned its attention to the largest financial crisis since the economic decline. However, other well-known banks and financial institutions do not show any signs of difficulty. According to opinions from people at the Reconstruction Finance Corporation in Washington, everyone believes that this financial crisis can be resolved satisfactorily and that depositors will not suffer losses.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Causes of the Crisis <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>After the news of the suspension of payments in Michigan spread, the entire country was shocked. Stock prices on the New York and other major city stock exchanges immediately plummeted, but after learning that the crisis was largely caused by the panic of small depositors, the market rebounded slightly. Governor Comstock initially claimed that the Ford Motor Company refused to allow the company to pay small depositors and interest on RFC loans first, saying that its deposits were large and that it was the most important industry in the city, so it should have priority in payment, and therefore should be held directly responsible for causing the crisis. Later, Comstock stated that his previous statement was a misunderstanding and specifically withdrew his accusations against the Ford Motor Company, and said that the Ford Motor Company had followed the advice of Chrysler and General Motors, and continued to allocate huge sums of money to support the Union Guardian Trust Company. It has now supported 20 million yuan and promised to continue lending. In addition, the Detroit banking community also stated that it could raise 25 million yuan by tomorrow morning, and depositors could first withdraw 5% of their deposits, which greatly reduced the panic.</p>

<p>The Treasury Department and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation are closely monitoring the situation here, and the Senate will also demand a thorough investigation of the contents of the loans made by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to the borrowing banks, because rumors have spread that the company often lends huge sums of money to banks just before they are about to collapse. A proposal to investigate the company's loans has already been submitted some days ago.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Detroit, 15th - Banks across the United States today sent cash by train and plane to provide assistance to banks here, so that they could reopen as soon as possible before the end of the suspension period and resume normal operations. According to estimates from the clearinghouse here, 50 million yuan in cash has already arrived. However, there are differing opinions among financial advisors as to whether to allow banks to reopen immediately, so Governor Comstock has not yet made a decision.</p>

<p>Reuters, Berlin, 14th - Today, the Civil Rights Protection Committee of the Parliament convened, but the meeting ended in chaos, resulting in no resolution.

At that time, members of the Socialist Party and the Communist Party all withdrew from the meeting. When they left the meeting place, members of the National Socialist Party ridiculed them. The Center Party, the Socialist Party, and the People's Party have protested to President Hindenburg about the actions of the National Socialist Party.</p>

<p>Pilot Hu Qiyi Killed on the Spot</p>
<p>Air Force Headquarters Has Provided Compensation According to Precedent</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence, the Guangdong Air Force has recently intensified training in order to cope with the national crisis. However, during diligent practice, the Morse-type No. 501 aircraft of the Fifth Squadron crashed again on the 8th. The pilot was Hu Qiyi. Hu was a captain pilot who diligently practiced his skills. A few days before the accident, he encountered danger once, but fortunately he was only slightly injured. He was hospitalized to heal his wounds, with bandages covering one eye and not yet recovered. On the 8th, he drove the plane again for training. Squadron Leader Xu Guangfu initially forbade his departure, but Hu smiled in response. He then flew the No. 501 aircraft high into the sky to practice tactics for twenty minutes. At 1:30 PM, after finishing the practice, he descended eastward, but at this time the aircraft suddenly malfunctioned, and the entire aircraft tilted and fell. Hu was unable to save the situation and eventually crashed on a low house near the Sibeidi Township in Dongshan Temple. The house collapsed and the plane was destroyed. Hu's head was pierced, blood spurted out, and he lost consciousness. Later, the Dongshangang police discovered the scene, rushed forward to rescue him, and telegraphed the Air Force Headquarters. Military doctors were immediately dispatched to provide treatment, and various medicines were injected, and the pulse began to tremble again. He was then sent to the Zhongda Hospital for rescue. After a long time, Hu's breath suddenly stopped, and he died immediately. The Air Force Department immediately provided compensation according to the precedent for death in the line of duty, purchased a coffin worth 500 yuan for a grand funeral, and approved burial in the Air Force public cemetery. Hu Qiyi was a graduate of the Fifth Class A of the Air Force School, 22 years old, and unmarried. His brother, Hu Qixuan, also died in the line of duty a few months ago while driving a plane to test the radio. The Hu brothers are the sons of Hu Hanxian, the current principal of the Aviation School. Hu has four sons who are all studying aviation, and two of them have already died.

<p>Huang Yixun, an inspector of the Wuyi Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, used to run a sugar warehouse, but he was unemployed after the warehouse stopped operating and was in poor circumstances. He was recommended by his colleagues to serve as an inspector in the Anti-Japanese Association, and he has been in this position for a long time. Unexpectedly, at around 8:00 AM on the 14th, a young man wearing a rush flower leather robe suddenly came to Huang's residence at No. 40 Qingguo Lane, saying that he needed to talk to Mr. Huang. At this time, Huang had just gotten up and was still wearing short clothes. He immediately went out to see him. Before he could say a few words, another young man wearing a gray leather robe broke into the room, took out a pistol from his sleeve, and fired two shots at Yixun. He also placed a letter on the table. At this time, Yixun had already fallen to the ground after being shot. The young man fired another shot at him, and then fled. Afterwards, the family reported to the nearby public security agency and carried the injured man to the Wujin Hospital for treatment. After the doctor's examination, it was found that the injuries were on the left side of the navel and the right leg, with a total of two shots. The bullets had all passed through, and because the injuries were in vital areas, he died at 11:45 AM. As for the letters left behind, one was addressed to Huang Yixun, mainly saying that he was defrauding others in the name of the Anti-Japanese Association. The second letter was addressed to all investigators of the Anti-Japanese Association, and it was a warning, signed "Sworn to Eliminate Treacherous Group Branch". Before the two young men broke into Huang's residence, Huang's friend Xie Xuanguan was at home waiting for Huang to talk. The Public Security Bureau is afraid that he is a suspect and has sent him to the County Court Procuratorate for interrogation.

Then they rushed into the headquarters, moved all the luggage and belongings of the Basic Cadre Team members to the open space, and set them on fire. They also searched for firearms in separate groups. They did not disperse until two hours later. After receiving the news, the County Magistrate immediately sent the Basic Cadre Brigade and police officers from the Public Security Bureau, totaling more than 50 people, fully armed, to Tianhou Palace overnight, and arrested seven ringleaders.

<p>Absolutely No Political Involvement: Rumors Are Inaccurate</p>
<p>Japanese Ambassador to China, Yoshizawa Kenkichi, has been staying in Shanghai and has not met with Chinese diplomatic authorities for a long time. Recently, with the tense situation in the League of Nations, the Japanese ambassador suddenly drove to the World Academy on Ferguson Road on the morning of the day before yesterday (the 14th) at about 11:00 AM to visit Duan Qirui. He talked for about twenty minutes before leaving. This has aroused all kinds of speculation from the outside world, and some say that this is the prelude to the Japanese side's diplomatic campaign. Yesterday afternoon, the reporter of this newspaper specially visited Mr. Xu Shiying. According to Mr. Xu, the Japanese ambassador's visit to Duan was completely a private visit. When Duan came to Shanghai, Yoshizawa had already sent someone to express his regards and asked to schedule an appointment to meet and inquire about his well-being. During the meeting yesterday (i.e., the day before yesterday), the conversation only lasted twenty minutes, and most of it was ordinary socializing talk, with absolutely no political involvement. External speculation is not true. Duan's new residence on Avenue Joffre is still being renovated and will be moved into in about a week. Also, Duan's nephew, Yun Kai, told reporters from various news agencies yesterday morning that Wang Yitang is scheduled to come to Shanghai at the beginning of next month. Old Mr. Zhi's attitude has been clearly expressed, that is, patriotism has no distinction between the ruling and opposition parties. Regarding the Defense Committee, I have not heard of it. Traveling to Hangzhou will have to wait until the weather is warmer.</p>

<p>Enthusiastic Donations: The association received donations yesterday, including 300 yuan from the Shen Xin Textile Factory No. 2, saved from spring banquet expenses, and 141.87 yuan from employee donations. Additionally, employees of the Du Wu Family Cooked Meat Store on Zhejiang Road donated 30 yuan.

<p>Raising Funds for a "Ningbo" Plane: The Ningbo Association in Shanghai, based on a proposal from Standing Committee members Sun Meitang and Mao Heyuan, as well as members Shui Xiangyun, Lin Bingshu, Fan Caicong, Dong Genfu, Wu Tinglun, and others, to raise funds to purchase a "Ningbo Association in Shanghai" aircraft to resist the enemy and strengthen national defense, convened a special temporary meeting of the Standing Committee yesterday to discuss implementation methods. Committee members Fang Jiaobo, Sun Meitang, Mao Heyuan, Zhang Jiguang, and others were present. Sun Meitang first explained the main purpose of the aircraft purchase proposal, and then Director Zhang Shenzhi of the association reported on the proposal plan submitted by members Shui Xiangyun and others. The matter was put to a vote, and it was decided to establish a special committee to handle the matter.

<p>Raising Funds for a "Citizens' Plane": According to the Far East News Agency, the 15th District branch of the Municipal Joint Association and the joint association of businesses on Suzhou Road North, Xishan Road, and Tangjia Lane initiated a fundraising campaign for a "Citizens' Plane." Yesterday, committee members Zhu Zhichun, Liu Donghai, and Lu Rongtang sent a letter to the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Joint Association, requesting registration to facilitate the effort. The letter stated, "The Japanese bandits are pressing, and the nation is on the verge of collapse. The only effective weapon for resisting aggression and saving the country is the air force.

<h3 id="e95">Telegram from the Volunteer Army Relief Association Regarding Relief Efforts <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Association sent telegrams on the 14th of this month (the day before yesterday) to various units of the Heilongjiang forces that had retreated to Rehe, informing them of the relief efforts. It also sent a telegram to General Zhu Ziqiao, inquiring about the relief provided to Zhang Haitian (aka "Old North Wind"). Excerpts from the telegrams are as follows:</p>
<p>Relief for the Deng Wen and Other Units: To Commanders Deng Wen, Li Zhongyi, and Shao Binshan in Rehe: After your units came to Rehe from Heilongjiang, General Zhu and Supervisor Wan sent telegrams to this association, requesting assistance. In addition to allocating 10,000 yuan in relief funds and 300,000 rounds of ammunition, which were forwarded by General Zhu, we have also allocated all the material goods raised by this association, including 90 tents, cotton uniforms, blankets, other clothing items in 96 large packages, and 13 boxes of military medical equipment purchased at the request of Messrs. Duan Zhongsen, Wu Huanzhang, and Jiang Songnian. All of these items will be transported to the front lines by Mr. Jiang Songnian for use by your units. This is a drop in the bucket, but it is our humble effort to assist. Please discuss and distribute the items upon arrival, and we look forward to your telegram in response. Respectfully, the Standing Committee of the Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Association, Chu Fucheng, Li Cishan, Yin Zhufu, Wu Shan, Feng Shaoshan, Yu Huancheng, Yan Zhifang, Chen Yafu, and others.</p>

Following recent victories in Xiuyan, Guanshanmen, and Huanghuadianzi, we blew up the South Manchurian Railway and transferred to Rehe to receive ammunition and uniforms. Three thousand iron cavalry have been fighting for over a year and are extremely weary. Please allocate 50,000 yuan in consolation money and supplies to alleviate the suffering of those who have fought bravely." Therefore, after investigating, we found that Zhang Haitian's unit had previously been allocated 100,000 rounds of ammunition and 5,000 yuan in relief funds, which were forwarded to you. Please verify whether Li Chunhua is serving as the commander-in-chief of the Second Army Corps and the squads and whether your office has provided relief, and please provide a response for verification purposes. Respectfully, the Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Association.</p>

<h3 id="e97">Reconstruction Projects in the Disaster Area <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Actively Underway</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Shanghai Municipal Government, recognizing the importance of reconstructing the disaster area, has formulated a phased implementation plan, issuing municipal bonds worth 6 million yuan, with 4.8 million yuan actually received. The use of these funds was approved by the 215th municipal meeting on September 30th of last year. Among these uses, those directly related to the reconstruction of the disaster area include 1 million yuan for the restoration of roads and bridges in the disaster area. Other uses, such as 500,000 yuan for the restoration of roads and bridges in the old city and the completion of arterial roads, 800,000 yuan for the construction of the central area, and 500,000 yuan for the construction of roads and bridges connecting to the new railway station, are indirectly related to the reconstruction of the disaster area. It has been learned that construction has already begun on the Qingyun Bridge, Bazhi Bridge, and Tiantong'an Road Bridge, as well as the repair of Jungong Road, Zha Yin Road, and Jiaotong Road, and the completion of Pudong Avenue. Projects currently out for bid include the construction of Hongjiang Road Bridge, Linping Road Bridge, and East Jiaotong Road Bridge, as well as the laying of drainage pipes in the Wusong and Jiangwan districts. The progress of construction, with a focus on the more important projects, is briefly described below: (I) Jungong Road and Zha Yin Road: Although some repairs have been made to restore traffic since the destruction during the January 28th Incident, the road foundations are not solid and will not last. Therefore, the Bureau of Public Works has decided to add crushed brick foundations to ensure long-term stability. The total length of the two roads is 15 kilometers. Construction on Zha Yin Road has already begun and will be completed soon. Vehicles traveling from Zhabei to Wusong will be able to use this road, which will be more convenient. Construction on Jungong Road will also begin within days and is expected to be completed in three months. (II) Jiaotong Road is the only thoroughfare from Zhabei to Zhenru, and the number of vehicles traveling on it is increasing daily. Since the road has not been thoroughly repaired since the war, it is difficult to achieve perfection. The Bureau of Public Works is also adding crushed brick foundations to ensure its solidity. The road is 5 kilometers long and is expected to be completed in two months, which should bring a new look. (III) Pudong Avenue: Originally one of the city's arterial roads, the Bureau of Public Works had already begun construction, but it was halted by the January 28th Incident. Now, construction has resumed. The road is 14 kilometers long, with crushed brick foundations. All the bridges on the road are in the planning stage and will soon be under construction. Other projects, such as the repair of Baoshan Road, Qiujiang Road, Hongxing Road, and the roads and bridges in the Wusong and Jiangwan districts, are either out for bid or still in the planning stage. It is expected that these projects will also be implemented soon.</p>
<h3 id="e98">The Water Price Issue Remains in Dispute <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The Public Works Department Held a Meeting Yesterday with No Results</p>
<p>The Real Estate Association Inquired but Received No Clear Answer</p>
<p>Tangshan Road's Sanxingfang is Cut Off from Water Again</p>
<p>(Public Works Department)</p>
<p>Board Meeting Held Yesterday: According to the Guowen News Agency, the directors of the Public Works Department held a meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss the issue of water price increases. Eleven directors were present. Due to the excessive water price increases, disputes have repeatedly arisen between the water company and residents, making it necessary to find a proper solution. Several proposals were made by the directors during the meeting and were discussed, but no decisions were made. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM, and it was decided to postpone the meeting and reconsider the issue.</p>
<p>Reply to Two Organizations: According to the Far East News Agency, the 26th District branch of the Municipal Joint Association and the Jiangxi Road Business Association and other organizations expressed their opposition to the installation of water meters by the British water company, which constitutes a disguised price increase, and requested the Public Works Department to stop it. Yesterday, they received a reply from the Public Works Department stating, "We have received your letter of the 8th of this month regarding the opposition to the installation of water meters. The Bureau has already forwarded this matter to the water company for proper planning to avoid increasing the burden on citizens. The matter is currently under consideration. Respectfully, the Secretariat of the Public Works Department."</p>
<p>(Real Estate Association)</p>
<p>Kui Yanfang Inquires: According to the Guowen News Agency, the Shanghai Real Estate Association received a report yesterday from Huada Real Estate Company in Shunzhi Lane, Kunming Road, stating that at noon on the 14th, Chinese and Western detectives, along with personnel from the water company, went to cut off the water. After receiving the report, Kui Yanfang, a standing committee member of the association, went to the Public Works Department at around 10:00 AM yesterday to inquire with Chief Officer Jones about which department had sent the detectives. Jones replied that he did not know about the matter. Kui then met with Superintendent Fees, who also replied that he did not know about the matter. Kui then urged him to investigate thoroughly, stating that the water price increase to 7.5 cents was still conditional and paid under protest. Now, with the installation of water meters, the price is increasing even further. He asked how landlords would be compensated for this significant loss. He stated that the water company is taking whatever it wants and cutting off the water supply, which is essential for residents' survival, at the slightest dissatisfaction, which is tantamount to holding people's lives hostage. He added that Superintendent Fees, as the superintendent of the Public Works Department and a director of the water company, should advocate for fairness and should not prioritize the interests of a small number of people in the water company over the interests of the majority of the public.</p>
<p>(Tenants)</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, since the water company installed new water meters, water cutoffs have been frequent. Yesterday, Sanxingfang on Tangshan Road was cut off from water again. Tenants negotiated with the Public Works Department and the water company but received no clear answers. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Petition to the Ratepayers Association: At around 11:00 AM yesterday, the British water company suddenly sent a Westerner and several workers to close all the water supply in Sanxingfang on Tangshan Road, effectively cutting off the water supply. The tenants of the neighborhood, believing that water is an indispensable part of daily life and that the sudden lack of water would endanger their lives, elected Zhu Xingfu, Fang Mingcai, Pan Zheming, Peng Zizhen, Wang Yaozeng, Zhang Defu, and others to rush to the Chinese Ratepayers Association to petition. They were received by Secretary Tao Leqin. The representatives were agitated and demanded that the Ratepayers Association immediately negotiate strongly with the Public Works Department and order the water company to restore the water supply. Secretary Tao drafted a letter of introduction for the representatives to meet with Counselor He DeKui at the Public Works Department and then introduce them to meet with Superintendent Jones for a response. The representatives thanked him after receiving the letter and went to the Public Works Department to negotiate.</p>
<p>Negotiations with the Public Works Department: The representatives went directly to the Public Works Department to negotiate. The Counselor received them and conveyed the representatives' petition to the Superintendent. The Superintendent used the telephone to inquire with the water company, which replied that the water was cut off because the landlord had not paid the fees. The representatives then presented their previous payment checks. The Superintendent then asked the representatives to negotiate directly with the water company. The representatives received no clear answer and then went to the water company to negotiate, but there were no results. It is reported that the tenants felt that the Public Works Department had failed to ensure the stability of important issues for the public within the settlement and were extremely dissatisfied. They may take further steps.</p>
<p>Water Prices Increased Threefold: The neighborhood consists of 107 buildings, with hundreds of households and over a thousand residents. Since the water was cut off, people have been panicking. The property is owned by the Jingji Company. After the water company installed water meters without authorization, the company believed that the matter was still under negotiation and continued to pay the water price at the previous rate of 7.5 cents. They sent two checks, No. 0032243 for 1,000 yuan from the Zhejiang Industrial Bank and No. 454610 for 666.20 yuan from the Zhongfu Bank, on December 1st of last year. However, the water company ignored the social situation and returned the two checks. They then resent them on January 24th, but they were returned again. The water company also limited the Jingji Company to pay the increased water price by February 3rd, or the water would be cut off. Although the Jingji Company negotiated with the water company several times, the water was finally cut off yesterday morning. The British water company claimed that the water was cut off because the landlord did not pay the water bill, which is a fabrication. At the same time, the water company's tough attitude is evident. Since the installation of the meters, the amount of the water price increase is more than threefold.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Regarding the Illegal Road Construction Case, the Japanese Consul, Under Orders, Visited the British and American Consuls Yesterday <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Will Visit Superintendent Fees Again Soon for Talks</p>
<p>According to the New Sound News Agency, negotiations on the illegal road construction case in the Shanghai International Settlement, which had stalled between the Municipal Government and the Public Works Department due to Japanese opposition, and between the Public Works Department and the Japanese Consul General due to the Japanese Consul's request for instructions, have been suspended. Yesterday, Japanese Consul General Ishii suddenly visited British Consul General Brenan and American Consul General Cunningham from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM to continue discussing the matter. After the meeting between the Japanese Consul and the British and American Consuls, a reporter from the New Sound News Agency inquired with the Japanese Consulate about the contents. According to the spokesperson, the instructions had been received some time ago. Recently, as British Consul Brenan and American Consul Cunningham will be returning to their countries at the end of next month and in June or July, respectively, the Japanese Consul had to consult with the British and American Consuls before they left Shanghai. However, he believed that this case would not be resolved before the British Consul left Shanghai, as Mr. Brenan's departure was imminent. The spokesperson added that the Japanese Consul's visit to the British and American Consuls was not only for the illegal road construction case but also for other matters that needed to be discussed. Ishii is also planning to meet with Public Works Department Superintendent Fees again soon to continue discussions, but the date of the meeting has not yet been set.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Public Security Bureau and Other Agencies Jointly Announce Standards for Rent Reduction and Exemption in the War Zone <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The city suffered great losses during the January 28th Incident. The Municipal Government sent personnel from various bureaus to conduct on-site surveys and propose four standards for rent reduction and exemption, which have been approved. Yesterday, the Public Security, Finance, Land, and Social Bureaus jointly announced, "Regarding the joint announcement, this bureau and others previously received Instruction No. 3017 from the Municipal Government, stating that, according to the petition from war-zone merchants Chen Xianshen and others, they suffered great losses last year due to the war and requested rent reduction and exemption. The instruction ordered us to jointly review and report. After several discussions and on-site surveys, and in reference to the standards for rent reduction and exemption in the war zone, we proposed four standards for rent reduction and exemption in the war zone and submitted them to the Municipal Government for approval. Now, we have received Instruction No. 34836 from the Municipal Government, stating, 'The submission has been noted. As various bureaus have sent personnel to conduct on-site surveys and assess the disaster situation and propose reduction and exemption standards, which are appropriate, they should be implemented as proposed. The bureaus should jointly announce and post the standards in the area for public awareness.' Therefore, we are now announcing the four rent reduction and exemption standards as follows, and we urge the public in the area to comply with them. The announcement includes: (I) For houses that have not been destroyed, rent exemption for three months in accordance with the rent reduction and exemption standards; (II) For houses that have been destroyed but have now been restored or partially restored, rent exemption for six months; (III) For houses that have been destroyed and not restored, but the surrounding area has commercial activity, rent exemption for nine months; (IV) For houses that have been destroyed and not restored, and the surrounding area has not been restored, rent exemption for one year."</p>
<h3 id="e106">Prohibition of Free Levying of Contributions by Organizations <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Received Instructions from the Executive Yuan Yesterday to Comply</p>
<p>The Municipal Government received instructions from the Executive Yuan yesterday, stating that the free levying of contributions by people's organizations not only causes people to doubt mass organizations and hinders their own development but also inevitably disrupts social order and violates national laws and regulations. All such activities should be prohibited. The full text of the instructions is recorded below for compliance. "The Ministry of Interior has reported that, after reviewing the various proposals decided at the Second National Interior Affairs Conference, all those that could be adopted have been reported or circulated. The proposal from the Fujian Provincial Department of Civil Affairs to prohibit mass organizations from levying contributions was approved by the conference and submitted to the Executive Yuan for prohibition. After further review, the Ministry believes that the free levying of contributions by mass organizations will disrupt the national financial system and increase the burden on the people. If not strictly prohibited, it will not only cause people to doubt mass organizations and hinder their own development but also inevitably disrupt social order and violate national laws and regulations. Therefore, we are submitting the original proposal for your review and implementation for public convenience. In addition to issuing instructions and circulating them, we are also submitting the original proposal and ordering the Municipal Government to comply, instructing its subordinates to prohibit all such activities."</p>
<h3 id="e107">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sends Telegram Requesting Rectification of the Excise Tax on Machine-Made Goods <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Telegram to the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance yesterday, requesting rectification of the tax exemption method for machine-made goods. The original telegram stated, "To the esteemed Ministry of Finance in Nanjing: On the 13th of this month, the Shanghai Chinese Soap Industry Association sent a letter stating that, 'We have received a letter from your association stating that, in response to our previous request to the Ministry of Finance to order that machine-made goods approved for machine-made treatment be exempt from tax in the same way as native goods, the Ministry has approved that machine-made goods transported domestically by sailing vessels or trains, which were originally taxed by the Customs, should continue to be exempt from tax, so as to be treated the same as native cloth.' We have informed our members, the machine-made soap factories. Now, the Nanyang Soap Factory and others have reported that they have complied with the Ministry's approval. However, according to the Customs, the exemption for machine-made goods refers to factories that are not registered with the Ministry. Factories that were previously registered with the Ministry and approved do not have explicit exemption statements in the original approval and must still pay taxes before they can be released.' Our members, including Wuzhou Guben, Nanyang, Xinchang, Henry, Dingfeng, Yonghe, Lida, Shouhua, Huachang, Gongmao, and Qixin factories, are all registered with the Ministry and are approved to receive machine-made goods treatment. Therefore, our previous letter stated that we had received approval on record. Now, the Customs is insisting on its position, which is a misunderstanding. The machine-made goods treatment embodies prudence in promotion. Therefore, registration is necessary to have this legal status. The original approval clearly refers to machine-made goods, which of course have gone through registration procedures. Otherwise, how can they be considered machine-made goods? Now, registered machine-made goods cannot be treated the same as goods that claim to be machine-made without approval, which is unfair. Therefore, we respectfully request your association to request the Ministry of Finance to inform the Customs again to avoid unfairness.' We have investigated that the tax exemption method for machine-made goods imitating foreign styles is based on registration approval. Those not registered with the Ministry are taxed as native goods, which has been the case for a long time. Now, the Customs is saying that those not registered with the Ministry can enjoy tax-exempt treatment, while factories that have been registered with the Ministry must still pay taxes for release. We do not know what regulations this claim is based on, which is difficult to understand. We respectfully request your Ministry to review the situation, issue an order to the Customs to rectify the situation, and order them to handle the matter according to the previous approval to show fairness, which would be greatly appreciated. Respectfully, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>

<p>Yesterday, Comparison Weighing Between Northern Goods and Southern Goods Industries</p>
<p>United Market to Hold General Meeting Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Shanghai Sugar, Northern Goods, and Southern Miscellaneous Goods Joint Market has been experiencing a dispute between the sugar and northern goods industries and the southern goods industry regarding the conversion rates for the new weighing instruments. Yesterday, the two sides conducted a comparison weighing. This afternoon, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce will convene a meeting to mediate. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Yesterday's Comparison Weighing: Representatives from the northern goods industry and the southern goods industry conducted a comparison weighing at 3:00 PM yesterday at the Kunyuan Northern Goods Company on Foreign Firm Street in the French Concession, using the old system guildhall scales and the new system municipal scales. Attendees included Gong Jingyan and Ni Baofu from the Southern Goods Industry Association, and Qiu Yangzhi from the Northern Goods Industry Association. The results of the comparison weighing showed that 100 catties on the new municipal scales equaled 97.25 catties on the old system guildhall scales. Calculating at a 90% discount, this equals 87.525, which differs from 88 by 0.475, and from 87 by 0.525. However, the southern goods industry still demands 87, while the northern goods industry insists on 88.</p>
<p>Today's Mediation: The Municipal Chamber of Commerce is scheduled to convene a meeting at 2:00 PM this afternoon, bringing together the Sugar Industry Association, the Northern Goods Industry Association, and the Southern Goods Industry Association in the Municipal Chamber of Commerce meeting room to mediate and decide on a fair conversion method. Luo Qinghua has been designated as the chairman. Zheng Zenan and Xu Jingfu will represent the sugar industry, Qiu Yangzhi will represent the northern goods industry, and Gong Jingyan and Ni Baofu will represent the southern goods industry.</p>
<p>Market Meeting: A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency met with Qiu Yangzhi of the Northern Goods Industry Association yesterday. According to Qiu, the conversion rate for the new weighing instruments is based on a resolution passed by the Joint Market. Without approval from a general meeting, it cannot be changed without authorization. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has scheduled a mediation for the 16th. As for the Joint Market, it has been decided to convene the executive committee again on the 17th to discuss the policy.</p>

<p>Shanghai Times Electric News Agency Local News: After receiving the appeal for donations from the Temporary Relief Committee for War Refugees in Shanghai, our embassy in Finland immediately began fundraising. However, the embassy in Finland has now received instructions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to close down and is in the process of finalizing matters. Therefore, they have no time to attend to fundraising. The members of the embassy have done their best to donate, raising a total of 259.80 Finnish marks. They immediately purchased one pound and four shillings in British gold and sent it to Shanghai along with official letter number 989. An excerpt from the original letter reads: "We received your letter, noting that fundraising is difficult, expenses are vast, and resources are dwindling. You requested us to widely solicit donations and provide continuous aid to benefit our compatriots, which is a deed of immeasurable merit. We note that the Japanese invaders have ravaged our China, destroying cultural institutions, and the loss of life and property of merchants is incalculable. The disaster victims have been displaced, a matter of great grief and heartache. All of our compatriots should do their utmost to donate and save these people. However, the number of overseas Chinese in Finland is small, and this embassy has now received an order from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to close down and is in the process of finalizing matters. We have no time to attend to fundraising. We have done our best to donate from the members of the embassy, raising a total of 259.80 Finnish marks, which has been used to purchase one pound and four shillings in British gold. A draft is enclosed, along with a list of donors. Please verify receipt and send the receipt to the embassy in Sweden for forwarding.

<h3 id="e113">Overseas Chinese in Chicago Donate Large Sum to Volunteer Army <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese in Chicago, deeply angered by the Japanese invaders' barbarity, their invasion of the Northeast, and their recent seizure of Shanhaiguan and Jiuguan, constantly advancing and acting unscrupulously, formed the Chicago Branch of the Chinese Nationalist Party, the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Donation Committee, and the Chicago Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association Theater Troupe to raise funds through performances to support the brave soldiers fighting the enemy. Now that the performances have concluded, a meeting has been convened and it was resolved that the Bank of China would remit 10,000 yuan in national currency to the Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe Volunteer Army Support Association for distribution to the various anti-Japanese volunteer armies in the Northeast. The remaining amount will be made up by Tan Zan. On the 21st of last month, Tan Zan, Zheng Junze, Wu Liu, and Xie Weibang were appointed to handle the remittance to Shanghai. The original text of the association's official letter is transcribed below:</p>
<p>Letter to the Support Association: "We write to inform you that the brutal Japanese are acting with violence and causing disaster in our country. The Northeast has been lost for more than a year, and the 30 million compatriots outside the Pass are suffering terribly. Since the 'September 18th' incident of the previous year, the Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe National Salvation Volunteer Army have been fighting the enemy and striving for the glory of our Chinese nation. Their brave spirit is enough to encourage the weak, but they suffer from weapons fire, hunger, cold, and disease. Their situation is extremely difficult, with supplies and weapons cut off. How can they endure? If the Northeast falls, the interior will also fall. Now that Shanhaiguan has been lost and Rehe is in danger, the Northeast Volunteer Army is isolated outside the Pass. If we want them to reinforce each other and attack the Japanese, the rear must provide support. The entire nation has a responsibility. Only iron and blood can win survival, and only money can speak to strength. Material and spiritual assistance must complement each other. This will not only boost the morale of the army but also inspire the spirit of the people to fight together, resist the enemy, and save the nation, showing our determination to resist to the end. Our association was formed at the beginning of the Shanghai war last year and has remitted funds to support the army, as reported previously. In order to meet the urgent needs of the Northeast Volunteer Army, we have joined forces with the Chicago Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association Theater Troupe to raise more funds for support. We are remitting 10,000 yuan through the Shanghai Bank of China today. The draft is enclosed with this letter. Please cash it and hand it over to your association. In correspondence with your receipt, please send it to the front for distribution to the anti-Japanese volunteer army in Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe, in the hopes that this will provide some comfort. This small amount of money is the hard-earned sweat of our overseas Chinese. We will continue to work hard to provide long-term assistance. Please verify receipt of the aforementioned remittance, and promptly send us a receipt for verification."</p>
<p>Letter to the Bank of China: "We write to inform you that we are remitting 10,000 Shanghai dollars through your bank. Please verify receipt, cash the draft, and send it to the Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe Volunteer Army Support Association in Shanghai for use in supporting the anti-Japanese volunteer army fighting in the four northeastern provinces. Please obtain a receipt from the Support Association and send it to us for verification."</p>

<p>After the Overseas Chinese Frugality Charity Association for Relief of Military Disasters in Vietnam launched a frugality movement in Annam, all overseas Chinese shops, schools, etc., saved one-tenth of their daily food expenses to help the Northeastern refugees. Since the implementation, the results have been remarkable, with more than 100,000 yuan already raised. However, there are only about 3,000 overseas Chinese shops and fewer than 20,000 people in the area. The results have been so significant that the association has sent a delegation, including Hu Dagang, back to China to promote the movement, hoping to unite the nation to save on daily food consumption to alleviate the national crisis. The delegation has been in Shanghai for several days and issued another declaration yesterday.</p>

<p>Party and Government Agencies Schedule Mediation</p>
<p>Following the labor dispute due to the dismissal of workers at Shao Wansheng in the local southern goods industry, the Party and government agencies have mediated several times without success. Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, the Social Affairs Bureau convened another inquiry. However, because the industry association did not attend, only Shao Yuqing and Wang Xingzhai, managers of Shao Wansheng, Yu Yaoqiu, Fan Xinsheng, and Shan Mengsheng, labor union representatives, and Dai Youheng, a representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, were present. Zhu Chongtao, a mediator from the Social Affairs Bureau, chaired the meeting. He stated that this case has been mediated several times, but no resolution has been reached due to differing opinions between the two parties. He hoped that each side would make concessions. The labor representatives stated that the employer had no reason to dismiss the two workers and demanded that they all be reinstated. The employer stated that the previous owner was from Ningbo, and this time the owner is from Shaoxing, leading to some Ningbo workers not being hired. The chairman believed that the employer's reasons were insufficient and that the workers should be allowed to return to work. The employer agreed to consult and reply within three days. The Party and government agencies announced that a scheduled mediation would be held again.</p>

<p>The Chinese Women's Relief Association for Northeastern Compatriots previously held a tea dance party that was a great success. It is reported that the association is currently finalizing the proceeds from the tickets sold for the tea dance party and preparing for a public announcement. However, because the ticket money from various sales agents has not yet been fully collected, another letter has been sent to urge them to remit the funds for settlement and detailed public announcement. The association received a letter yesterday forwarded by Shanghai Mayor Wu, stating that Mrs. Zhang Zhenhua recently reported that someone from the front line of Shanhaiguan met Mrs. Dong, the wife of Commander Dong in Chaoyang and Beipiao in Rehe, who said that they urgently needed one each of copper helmet, goggles, and binoculars. Please find a way to raise funds and send them as soon as possible for distribution. At the same time, Mrs. Shi Liangcai sent the association a letter, which was said to be a request for assistance from Ms. Yao Ruifang. Ms. Yao is the granddaughter of a wealthy Shanghai businessman, 19 years old, intelligent and brave, and capable of shooting with both hands. After the national crisis, she angrily abandoned her leisurely life and joined the army to the north to share the hardships with the anti-Japanese soldiers. She currently leads 3,000 volunteer soldiers, defending the Jinzhou-Chaoyang line. She is truly an outstanding woman. The association also plans to quickly raise a large sum of money to purchase the "Chinese Women" airplane for active anti-Japanese use. It is expected that the future results will be impressive.</p>

<p>Recovery Expected in Two to Three Weeks</p>
<p>Zheng Xitang, a prominent figure in the shipping industry, was suddenly attacked by kidnappers at the entrance of the Pingan Shipping Company on Xintai Wharf in Nanshi at around 1:00 PM on the 11th of this month. Zheng resisted strongly and escaped, but a bullet fired by the bandits killed Zheng's bodyguard, a Russian named Saishuofu. Zheng's forehead was also wounded by the gunfire. The bandits also fired shots to resist arrest, wounding two police officers and a pedestrian, who were taken to Tongren Hospital for treatment. These details have been reported in detail in this newspaper. It is now known that Zheng, after entering Tongren Hospital, was examined by Western doctors who found that he was only wounded by a bullet in the left posterior skull and that his brain was not injured. Therefore, the Western doctors removed the broken skull fragments during surgery, applied medication, and allowed him to sleep peacefully. Yesterday was the fourth day and he has passed the danger period, progressing well. His temperature has not increased, and he is mentally clear, able to consume thin porridge and milk. His life is expected to be saved. However, the wound is painful, and the Western doctor insisted that he could not receive visitors or talk too much to avoid overexerting himself. Therefore, business figures who visited the hospital in recent days were received and dealt with by his secretary, Xu Wanli. It is expected that Zheng's wound will recover in about two to three weeks, and he will be discharged from the hospital. Zheng has ordered that 400 yuan be given for the funeral expenses of the body of Zheng's bodyguard, the Russian Saishuofu, which was claimed by Jigu Jinuo (the nephew of the Russian) who took possession of the body and coffin.</p>

<p>Jiang Fuquan Lingers in the Courthouse Courtyard</p>
<p>Identified by Accomplices Ding Zinan and Others</p>
<p>The Arresting Officer Ordered Him Detained for Further Investigation</p>
<p>Fang Jin-hong, the import department head of the Sincere Company, was shot and killed on Yu Yuan Road in Western Shanghai around 8:00 PM on December 9th of last year by a group of bandits from Tongzhou, including Ding Zinan, Zhang Qishan, Zhang A'er, Yu Afu, Tang Yongfu, Qian Hengshan, Xi Houtao, and Wu A'er, in a kidnapping attempt that went awry.  Subsequently, the detective division of the Mixed Court Police discovered that the bandits were hiding in Changping Road and the French Concession, and arrested them. The case was heard by Judge Wu Tingqi of the First Special District Court, who sentenced Ding Zinan and others to death, and Yu Afu and others to life imprisonment.  Recently, the police learned that the key suspect in the case, Cao Houfu, was hiding on Longjiang Road, and ordered detectives to arrest Cao and bring him to the First Special District Court, requesting that he be detained for investigation. All of these details have been reported in the newspapers.  Yesterday morning was the scheduled hearing.  In addition to bringing Cao to court, the police also escorted Ding Zinan and others from the Western Prison to testify. When Ding Zinan and the others passed through the courthouse courtyard, they caught sight of Jiang Fuquan and shouted that he was their accomplice.  The detectives then stepped forward, arrested Jiang, and brought him to the case.  Judge Qian Wenji took the bench in the Eighth Tribunal to hear the case.  Police lawyer Wang Yaotang presented the case, stating that the detectives were escorting Ding Zinan, who had already been sentenced to death, to the court, when Ding and others shouted, saying that Jiang Fuquan was involved in the kidnapping of Fang Jin-hong, and that he was immediately arrested. He requested that the court question Jiang and allow him to be taken back to the police station for investigation.  Ding Zinan then testified that he had been introduced to Jiang Fuquan by his accomplice Zhang Qishan, and that Jiang Bao was involved in the kidnapping.  The judge then questioned Jiang Fuquan, who stated that he was 38 years old, from Tongzhou, living at 980 Jiaojianshi Road, and ran a small car business.  He stated that last December, when the police arrested Ding Zinan and others, he had gone to help, and that they were falsely accusing him out of spite. The judge considered the testimony and ordered that Jiang Fuquan be taken back to the police station for investigation.</p>

<p>A Slight Seduction Could Get Her Into a Hotel</p>
<p>Secretly Followed All the Way to Her Home</p>
<p>Yesterday morning around 10:00 AM, two men brought a young woman to the Second Precinct of the First District, accusing her of theft and requesting that she be punished.  The woman was quite beautiful, especially her pair of limpid eyes, clear and bright, set beneath delicate eyebrows, enough to captivate a man's soul and make him feel distracted.  She also had a graceful figure and wore a dark blue woolen serge, fur-lined cheongsam, a fur coat, and high-heeled leather shoes, making it clear at first glance that she was a modern, seductive woman.  During the preliminary hearing by the precinct chief, one man, Qiu Xitao, 31 years old, from Baoshan, residing at No. 9 Fuchang Lane, Xiaodongmen, stated that the other man, Sun Weishen, was his housemate. He continued, "Around 9:00 AM this morning, the woman (pointing to the young woman) secretly entered my home. I caught a glimpse of her acting suspiciously. However, because she was dressed in fashionable clothes, like someone from the upper class, I did not dare to scold her. I asked her what she was doing there, and she said she was looking for a friend. I told her to wait a moment, and then gathered my housemate Sun Weishen and others, and we searched each room to see if anything was missing. Sun discovered that a gold ring, engraved with his name, Weishen, was missing. It had been placed in a leather wallet, hidden in a box. We then searched the woman, and found Sun's gold ring inside her glove. At this point, the stolen goods were found, and we realized that the beautiful young woman was in fact a thief. Therefore, we brought her here, requesting that you investigate." He then presented the stolen ring. Sun Weishen testified that he was 30 years old, from Zhenhai, and worked as an accountant at a Shenzhuang (silk firm). The rest of his statement was the same as Qiu's. When questioned, the young woman stated that her name was Zhang Xiuying, 22 years old, from Hubei. Her husband used to be a battalion commander under a certain division, but unfortunately died in battle during a certain war. She is now staying with a relative near the Grand Clock in the French Concession. She continued, "Last night, after dinner, I went to the Tianyun Tower amusement park in the Wing On Company. I happened to meet this man (pointing to Sun Weishen). He immediately came over and started flirting with me. I was bewitched, and after the show ended, he took me to a nearby hotel and rented a room for three dollars and change. That night, I was raped. Afterwards, because my body was defiled, I told him that I wanted to stay with him for life. Sun agreed and suggested we exchange gold rings as a sign of our commitment. I gave him a gold ring engraved with the words 'Beloved,' and he gave me a ring engraved with his name. Today, when I said goodbye, I wanted to follow him to see what his home was like, so I secretly followed him.  However, his friend noticed me and suspected me of stealing, and Sun suddenly turned on me, falsely accusing me of being a thief and taking the gold ring he had given me off my finger, claiming it as stolen property. I never expected such ingratitude."  Because the statements of both parties differed, it was ordered that a written report be prepared and sent to the bureau for investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Sympathy for Mr. Ren Wangyue's View on Suicide <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>[Letter from Mr. Zhu Cixun]</p>
<p>After reading Mr. (your name here) answer to Ren Wangyue, as asked on the fifth of this month, "Is my view on suicide correct?", I feel that Mr. (your name here)'s thinking is a bit aristocratic. He (you) has (have) not considered the pain of the suicidal, and is(are) completely standing(ing) from the position of an upper-class level to sing high-pitchedly! I believe that suicide is certainly not the upward psychology of human beings, but we must think about the motives of suicide, and fundamentally attribute it to the shortcomings of the social system. Like the first type of suicide that Mr. Ren mentioned, the reason for Mr. (your name here) objection is: "As long as a person has a sound mind and thinking, even if he is blind, deaf, or lame, he has his work effectiveness, and he has the opportunity to do his best for society. If he commits suicide because of his unhealthy body and weakness, to be honest, half of the Chinese people will commit suicide." This reason is certainly not bad, but I want to ask Mr. (your name here) whether a sound mind and thinking must have considerable cultivation? Does the method of this cultivation still require the strength of society to create it? Second, blind people, deaf people, and lame people can all do their best for society, but how can they do their best? Do they have the opportunity to do their best? Last year, I personally saw a helpless disabled person who could not enter the disabled home to request support. The reason for the disabled home's refusal was that the number of people exceeded the quota. Ask this kind of disabled person, how should he struggle? The second type of suicide that Mr. Ren mentioned, the reason for Mr. (your name here) objection is: "The life of a dark slave is formed by the dark forces that oppress society and unequal society. To break this dark force, it is necessary to combine the greatest and most determined revolutionary forces in society, and accumulate the most lasting and valuable experience of struggle, and support a very strong and stable war organization to achieve success." The words are right, but, I think, people who live in slavery, if they have the spirit, perseverance, and courage that Mr. (your name here) mentioned above, then they would have gotten rid of their slave life long ago. Mr. (your name here), you must know that the life of a dark slave does indeed have the desire to resist and break through as Mr. Ren said, but it is impossible!" I think that people who live a dark slave life who cannot break free, if they have the courage to commit suicide, it may not be a bloody revolution. According to the current ban on keeping slaves promulgated by the government, does this mean that there are no slaves in China? If an underage girl is bought by someone to be a maid, ask her how to resist, how to break through her dark slave life? In addition, the environment created by bad customs and habits, I can responsibly say that she will never get sympathy and help from others, because many, many people commit suicide because they cannot bear the pain of this inhuman life. We cannot say that this kind of suicide is the most thorough act of unconditional surrender of a slave to his master. We can only attribute it to the shortcomings of the social system. Moreover, the actions of resistance and breakthrough are not that simple in fact. Like President Abraham Lincoln's emancipation of black slaves in the United States, he went through many difficulties. The emancipated black slaves still felt the pain of having nowhere to go for a while. Therefore, to resist and break through the dark slave life, it does not rely on the power of individuals to do it well.</p>
<p>Like the third type of suicide that Mr. Ren mentioned, the reason for Mr. (your name here) objection is: "What kind of learning and talents does Mr. Ren have that can arouse people's sympathy, and be worthy of a high carriage and fat horses, rich clothes and good food, a proud wife and beautiful concubines to solve Mr. Ren's depression and emptiness." The reason is very sufficient. We are not conceited now, nor are we blaming others. There are people in the current society who have less learning and talent than us who are eating their salary without doing anything and occupying a superior position. There may not be such people, to be rude, if someone like Mr. reporter is not considered a talent, nor can he be said to be a mediocre talent; if you lose your job and suffer from poverty, your job will be taken away by a mediocre talent who can flatter others, then, Mr. (your name here), please tell me sincerely, are you optimistic or not? Are you depressed or not? When you get to that situation, I am afraid that the number of people who sympathize with you will be reduced, and you can only curse the shortcomings of the social system? If you are in such a situation, and there is still a good way to struggle, please tell me in detail! Then people with high learning and talents who cannot get the opportunity to make progress in their lives will have to respect you as the leader of the social group. We are not trying to learn the Stoic school of Greece to advocate suicide. I have also painted a few articles about the voices of the weak and the troubles of young people, my outlook on life; but I always conclude with improving the social system; suicide is not necessarily a sign of the weak. Therefore, in the current society where there is no order, there is a crisis of suicide everywhere. To save this crisis, we must try to improve the social system. How to work hard to improve, I dare not say. Mr. (your name here) cannot advocate suicide. What we hope from Mr. (your name here) is what methods there are to eliminate suicide? The question is getting further and further away, and the scope is also expanding, so I will stop writing here. If Mr. (your name here) thinks it is worth discussing, we will discuss it in the Reader's Advisor column. (Reply will be published tomorrow)</p>

<h3 id="e140">Regulations for National Construction Scholarships Jointly Organized by the Examination and Education Ministries <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Dai Chuanxian, President of the Examination Yuan, has initiated a National Construction Scholarship Committee jointly organized by the Examination and Education Ministries to promote academics and advance national construction. The summary of the regulations is as follows:</p>
<p>(Organization of the Scholarship Committee) The committee will have three presidents, with the President of the Examination Yuan as an ex-officio president. The other two will be appointed by the National Government. There will be one chairman, rotating annually between the Chairman of the Examination Commission and the Minister of Education, and one vice-chairman, rotating annually between the Vice-Chairman of the Examination Commission and the Vice-Minister of Education. The Examination Commission and the Ministry of Education will appoint several committee members, five to seven of whom will be standing committee members, designated by the chairman, with a term of three years. However, additional reviewers and assistant reviewers may be temporarily appointed as needed for each examination or review to focus on evaluation, including determining the scope of questions, evaluation criteria, review of writings, deciding on passing grades, the total amount of scholarships, the amount of individual scholarships, the number and types of awards and certificates, and fundraising. All matters must be decided in meetings chaired in rotation by the presidents. The scholarship scope is roughly divided into two categories: (1) essays deemed excellent after evaluation and (2) academic works deemed truly valuable after review. Those who apply for essay examinations must meet the following requirements: (1) government employees with proof of employment, (2) non-incumbent government employees who are qualified to take the higher examinations and have proof from two incumbent recommended-rank or higher government officials or equivalent party affairs personnel, or presidents of specialized schools or above, and (3) those with equivalent academic qualifications and proof from higher academic institutions or academic organizations. Academic works must be recommended by national academic institutions, national universities, or academic organizations with achievements. After passing the review, rewards will be given. The scholarship award methods for essay examinations are: (1) awarding scholarships, with the total annual scholarship amount limited to 10,000 yuan each time, the total quarterly scholarship amount limited to 3,000 yuan each time, and the total monthly scholarship amount limited to 1,000 yuan each time, (2) awarding medals and certificates, with the number of people and types of awards and certificates to be determined by the committee and submitted to the Examination Yuan for approval. The committee's fundraising includes: (1) government allocations, (2) donations from private individuals and public organizations, (3) interest on deposits, and (4) proceeds from publications. A fund management committee will be established, composed of representatives from the Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, Judicial Yuan, Examination Yuan, Control Yuan, Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, and the Central Bank, with each institution sending one representative. Those who donate more than 10,000 yuan but less than 1,000 yuan may publicly elect one to seven representatives to participate in management. The committee members will each form a group, and each group will elect one standing committee member to form a standing committee to handle committee affairs.</p>
<p>(Regulations for Essay Examinations) The draft regulations for scholarship essay examinations have been drafted as follows: Article 1: These regulations are based on Article 8 of the Regulations for the National Construction Scholarship Committee. Article 2: The examination periods of the committee are as follows: (1) Annual examinations will be held once a year in March. (2) Quarterly examinations will be held four times a year in spring, autumn, and winter. (3) Monthly examinations will be held once a year. If the examination period cannot be held as scheduled due to special circumstances, the National Construction Scholarship Committee may decide to temporarily change it in a meeting. Article 3: The examination dates, subject categories, submission locations, number of admissions, and scholarship amounts for each examination in the preceding article will be announced by the National Construction Scholarship Committee two weeks before each examination. Article 4: Annual examinations are divided into two tests: the first test is a free essay written outside the examination hall, with a time limit of two weeks; the second test is an in-person interview, with a time limit of one day. Those who are not admitted in the first test may not take the second test. Quarterly and monthly examinations each consist of one test, both of which are free essays written outside the examination hall. The quarterly examination has a time limit of three days, and the monthly examination has a time limit of one day. Article 5: When holding the second test of the annual examination, the Control Yuan should be requested to send personnel to supervise the examination. Article 6: Examinees should pay an examination fee when registering for the examination and receiving the examination paper. The annual examination fee is two yuan per paper, the quarterly examination fee is one yuan per paper, and the monthly examination fee is five jiao per paper. Article 7: The personnel setting the questions for each examination should strictly maintain confidentiality and not disclose them to the outside world before the examination period. Article 8: The examination questions for each examination will be announced in front of the Examination Commission and the Ministry of Education and published in major newspapers in and outside the capital. However, the examination questions for the second test of the annual examination should be issued temporarily inside the examination hall. Article 9: Examinees should submit the examination papers within the time limit announced for each examination. Papers submitted after the deadline will not be accepted. Article 10: Examinees for the second test of the annual examination should enter the examination hall on time. Those who arrive after the deadline will not be allowed to take a make-up test. Article 11: The evaluation procedures for each examination are as follows: (1) For the annual examination, the assistant reviewers will conduct the initial review and propose scores, the reviewers will conduct the second review and determine scores, and the presidents will conduct the final review and determine scores. (2) For the quarterly examination, the assistant reviewers will conduct the initial review and propose scores, the reviewers will conduct the second review and determine scores, and the chairman will conduct the final review and determine scores. (3) For the monthly examination, the reviewers will conduct the review and determine scores, and the chairman will conduct the final review and determine scores. Article 12: After the examination papers of each examination have been evaluated, the number of admissions and the scholarship amount for each person will be announced in addition to being posted. Article 13: The scholarship amount to be awarded for the admitted examination papers will be given separately according to the amount specified in the announcement. If there are special works, the presidents may increase the amount to show excellence. Article 14: The top five candidates admitted in the annual examination, or the top five candidates successively admitted in the quarterly or monthly examinations with excellent results, may be awarded medals and certificates by the Examination Yuan in addition to the scholarship. Article 15: These regulations shall be implemented on the date of promulgation by the Examination Commission and the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>(Continuing Scholarship for Writings) A reporter from the Riri News Agency interviewed Wang Yongbin, Chairman of the Examination Commission, and Chen Daqi, Vice-Chairman, who stated that the first year's scholarship will be approximately 30,000 yuan, and funding has already been arranged. However, in the future, in addition to government allocations, it is hoped that all sectors will actively donate to avoid interruptions and to encourage participation. After the essay examination is successful, the second step will be to hold a scholarship for writings, which is of greater significance but more difficult to implement. This is because the level of various academic disciplines in China is generally inferior to that of the East and West, and it is not easy to recruit talents with the qualifications to evaluate writings domestically. In addition, the state has not paid much attention to academic awards in recent years, so it is difficult to arouse the interest of the academic community without good preparation. Currently, the three draft proposals for the Regulations for the National Construction Scholarship Committee, the Regulations for Essay Examinations, and the Regulations for the Fund Management Committee have all been submitted to the Central Political Council for review. Once they are passed, they can be formally prepared.</p>

<p>Since Zheng Zhenwen took office as the Director of the Fujian Provincial Department of Education, he has tried his best to protect educational talents. There have been no changes in the various bureaus and schools. Even in one or two schools, such as the Experimental Elementary School, the Agricultural and Forestry High School, and the Northern Fujian High School, where the principals resigned on their own, he still appointed the deans or directors of general affairs of each school to act as principals. It is said that after the school starts, he will personally go to his subordinates to inspect and then select talents to take over. However, the principal of Xiamen Vocational High School was recently changed. The reason for this is that the previous principal, Wang Shu, had poor performance since he took office. He received a monthly recurring expense of more than 2,000 yuan, but there were only more than 20 students in the entire school. The three classes offered, in addition to business, such as drawing and sewing, were mostly unnecessary. Chen Kezhong, an inspector from the Ministry of Education, and He Yunong, a military supervisor from the Provincial Department of Education, went to the school together for inspection last time and also believed that the performance was poor. The Provincial Department of Education has now appointed Wang Buai as the replacement. Wang graduated from a Japanese Higher Industrial School many years ago and has always had research on vocational education.</p>

<p>Examines Education and Visits Battlefields</p>
<p>丨Many Students Wishing to Study in England Contact Her丨</p>
<p>According to the Continental News, the China Committee of various universities in London recently sent Ms. Luo, a student, to China to promote friendship between the people of the two countries and to investigate certain educational issues. After arriving in Shanghai, she has been residing at her sister's residence at 2 Dofong Road for three weeks. In recent days, she has visited various educational institutions to examine everything and has also gone to libraries to engage in reference work. The lady once visited the ruins of the Oriental Library on Baoshan Road after it was burned down and was filled with sighs. In the past two weeks, Chinese students who want to study in England have often visited the lady, and many more have sent letters requesting assistance. They mistakenly believe that the lady is a representative of the China Committee of various universities and has the power to grant scholarships to Chinese students here. When they heard that the lady herself was also a student and that the only thing she could do for the students was to provide information on how to apply for this scholarship, according to the lady, the level of many of the students who visited was still insufficient. The lady also stated that Chinese women today are very eager to learn, but they are too modernized and things are trending towards extremes, which is not appropriate. When asked about the lady's opinions on companionate marriage and birth control, the lady replied that she was not concerned about such events. British women do not pay as much attention to this as their American sisters do. The lady plans to visit the Provincial First Normal School in Wuxi within a few days, and then plans to go to places such as Hangzhou and Nanjing to examine educational affairs. According to the lady, the China Committee of various universities plans to set up a Chinese student reception center in London for them to entertain friends and as a short-term residence. Everything will be done according to the YMCA method. According to the lady, she was born in Shanghai twenty-four years ago, and she feels particularly excited to revisit the old place.</p>

<p>First Entrance Examination Yesterday</p>
<p>Must Continue to Test Next Monday and Tuesday</p>
<p>The National Shanghai Business School is enrolling students for the specialized course this time, and the number of applicants is very enthusiastic. Yesterday was the date of the examination, and more than 40 people came to take the exam in the rain. However, there are still many people who are unable to take the exam as scheduled due to the distance and being preoccupied with their jobs. They have requested an extension for the continued examination. Xu Peikun, the president of the school, has approved the request to avoid regrets for those who are eager to learn, and has scheduled the continued examination for next Monday and Tuesday (i.e., the 20th and 21st of this month) from 7:00 to 9:00 pm at Qingnian Middle School on Xiafei Road (opposite the Paris Grand Theatre). Therefore, those who are interested can still go to report for the examination. It is also heard that the most applicants this time are for the journalism specialty. In order to cultivate journalism talents, the school has hired lecturers who are experts in journalism. Various courses are striving for completeness, such as the latest Bingxun-style Chinese shorthand, which is also one of the selected courses. In terms of training, strictness is taken to cultivate noble journalists to meet the needs of the times.</p>

<p>Strict Crackdown on Poor Examination Results</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 15th) The Ministry of Education issued a notice to the various provincial education departments, stating that the majority of middle school teaching in various places is following old routines, training and management are lax, academic results are not paid attention to during normal examinations, either teaching materials are used inappropriately, or teachers and textbooks are frequently changed, and there is no connection between the past and the future, resulting in low academic levels. The majority of students failed the recent joint examination. In addition to the grades of each school being revealed by the respective provincial education departments in accordance with the Regulations for the Joint Graduation Examination of Primary and Secondary School Students, the provincial education departments should quickly investigate the number of students taking the joint examination in each school. If more than half of them fail, the provincial education departments should give warnings to the respective schools depending on the circumstances, or order them to reorganize and improve teaching and management. If there is still no progress in the next joint examination results, all public and private middle schools should be strictly cracked down on or suspended separately. It is necessary to make the educational efficiency of each middle school gradually improve.</p>

Those who follow the old habits and use foreign language textbooks for non-foreign language courses still exist in some places. It is necessary to urgently reiterate the previous order. The textbooks for non-foreign language courses in the various schools should uniformly select national language textbooks from now on to facilitate teaching. Furthermore, the graduation joint examination to be held this semester will generally use Chinese questions, except for foreign language courses.

<p>Badminton Doubles Championship</p>
<h3 id="e148">Lin Qiu Was Eliminated Yesterday, Losing to the Portuguese 2-0 <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Seventeen to Eighteen丨Five to Fifteen</p>
<p>Lin Qiu Wins Exhibition Match</p>
<p>Carnevallo Willing to Teach Ball Skills</p>
<p>The Shanghai Badminton Championship began yesterday. In the first week of the doubles competition, Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai played against the two Portuguese, Xina and Xue Erfo. As a result of the fierce battle, Lin Qiu was unfortunately eliminated 2-0, 18-17, 15-5. Another game was played as an exhibition, and Lin Qiu won 15-5. Lin Baohua joined the singles competition. The first week was a bye, and the second week's competition will be held on the 25th.</p>
<p>(New Sport is Very Interesting) Badminton is a very popular sport among foreigners, but it is still a new sport among Chinese people. In order to promote it, the Badminton Club specially borrowed the court in Gezhi Public School on Beihai Road last night. Although it was drizzling, no less than three or four hundred people wanted to watch this new sport. The applause continued when they watched the tense and thrilling moments, indicating that they were very interested.</p>
<p>(The First Game Was a Pity to Lose) Xina and Xue Erfo had the right to serve first, and Clark was the referee. Xi Xue scored four points at once, and Lin Qiu regained three points. Then it became 5-4. In this tense situation, a situation of leaning left and right suddenly arose. Xi Xue suddenly broke out with 8-4. However, Qiu Feihai took turns serving and regained four points in a row, tying the score at 8-8. Unexpectedly, the opponent scored three points in a row again. At 12-10, the situation suddenly unfolded, and Lin Qiu chased to 12-12, and took the lead with 13-12. At this time, it was killed by the opponent. It was a pity, otherwise they would have won with two more points. Then it was 13-13, and Lin Qiu called a timeout. They were determined to win with five more points. Although Xi Xue had an advantage with 3-1, Lin Qiu killed the ball and added three points in a row, overtaking with 4-3. With one more point, they could also win. Unexpectedly, the opponent scored two points instead. In total, Lin Qiu lost the first game with 17-18, losing by only one point.</p>
<p>(The Second Game Was a Disaster) They were planning to fight hard to regain it in the second game, but unexpectedly, the situation changed drastically. Lin Qiu lost seven points in a row without paying attention. Although they regained two points at this time, Xi Xue went far away with 12-2. When it was Qiu Feihai's turn to serve, there was a great revival. He restored three points at once, but in the end, he lost again with 15-5, and was eliminated with 2-0.</p>
<p>(Lin Qiu Won the Exhibition Match) Finally, with the victory and defeat determined, the two sides played another game as an exhibition to entertain the audience. Lin Qiu went smoothly and got 9-2. The two Portuguese did not give in at all and fought hard, and it really became 9-9. As a result, Lin Qiu won 15-9, so the result can also be said to be 2-1.</p>
<p>(Qiu's Ball Skills Are Better Than Lin's) The two Portuguese have been playing for many years, so they are more mature in terms of connection and ball skills. The performance of Qiu and Lin is also quite good. The results of the first game show this. Qiu is even better than Lin. If Qiu joins the singles competition, the hope is greater than Lin. His kill ball is like his tennis ball, piercing the gaps and attacking people unprepared. The power of the kill ball is actually more interesting than tennis. Lin repeatedly tried to test the enemy with light pick in front of the net, but they were all broken by Xina. His smash is also not as stable as Qiu's. It is known that after this promotion, there will be great hope in the future. (Carnevallo's Talk) Tennis veteran Carnevallo told reporters that when he advocated badminton, there were only two teams established. Now it is popular and very interesting, which shows that there are people who love it. When Qiu was in Shanghai the year before last, Carnevallo joined Qiu in doubles and almost won the championship. Therefore, this year, he encouraged Qiu and Lin to participate to arouse the interest of the Chinese. Carnevallo is very willing to teach ball skills to the Chinese. If anyone wants to learn, please send a letter to the Shanghai Times Review Foreign Firm on Nanjing Road. Carnevallo can practice at the court. This is a great opportunity, so don't miss it.</p>

<p>Mr. Lihua,</p>
<p>I had the opportunity to meet you last time at the Zhejiang Construction Games. I was grateful that you did not abandon me and informed me of your plan to go to the United States this spring and invited Yueying to join you in the United States. I was entrusted with the training in your school. This is enough to show your enthusiasm for loving the country and loving talents. Yueying feels that her skills are insufficient to amaze people and her strength is insufficient to be competent. However, she is willing to do her best to contribute to the sports community in our country. In the end, because my mother was worried about me, I was unable to return to the east as instructed. I was idle at home and thought about what you asked Yueying to do, and I felt even more grateful and ashamed. So I asked about the preparations for going to the United States and also gave me a reply, instructing me to come to Shanghai as soon as possible to join the United States. At this time, Yueying decided to defy her mother's orders and come to Shanghai for the sake of the future of Chinese sports and for the kindness of your talent promotion. Since arriving at your school and revisiting all the facilities, I feel that there is too much lack of facilities that are essential for gymnasiums and physical education schools, and your school does not have them. The playground is no more than a few dozen feet, and the school building is precarious. To live with energetic sports people is truly a hero without a place to use his talents. Therefore, Yueying's feelings have changed again to your enthusiasm for running the school, your ambition to promote sports, and your love for talents. You do not focus on the school's own facilities, curriculum, and regulations. The improvement of the program and eagerly leading the small number of basketball talents in your school to expedition to the United States is to put vanity first and regard the school itself as unimportant. If this is the case, how can you achieve the popularization of sports and the success of the school? Yueying is deeply ashamed of you. If you do not allocate the funds raised for the trip to the United States to the construction of the school, dozens of students will benefit endlessly, and your success will be unlimited. Now, for the sake of sports in our country, for your success, for the future of your school, and for the students who have traveled thousands of miles to your school to study, I am sorry for not being able to respond to your expectations, and you can also take out Yueying's funds for going to the United States from the preparation fund and allocate it to the construction of your school as a small compensation. I am extremely frightened, ashamed and regretful, and I deeply pray for your understanding. I respectfully wish you a good day. 482 A special.</p>

<p>Mr. Guo won the championship, and his technique naturally had its merits and uniqueness. Compared to Mr. Wang, he was more experienced and steadier. His various shooting techniques were also quite proficient. However, luck is an indispensable indirect aid to victory and success, and Mr. Guo was particularly favored by it. Mr. Wang showed signs of improvement around the 53rd shot, but soon became silent again. In the end, both of them performed better in normal practice than in the finals, which is an unavoidable case of "stage fright." In the first 25 shots, Mr. Guo consistently had the upper hand, and Mr. Wang seemed to have lost his usual form. Mr. Guo was ahead with 57 to 25. In the next 25 shots, Mr. Guo continued to have great luck, while Mr. Wang still showed no improvement, with a difference of fifty or sixty points between them. In the final stage, Mr. Wang suddenly made an astonishing move, scoring 25 points in five shots, turning the situation around. The entire arena was stirred by this, but it was not sustainable. Mr. Guo remained focused and devoted himself to the target. Finally, he reached the goal of 160 points on the 78th shot. Looking back at Mr. Wang, he had also scored 120 points. Applause erupted, and the champion and runner-up shook hands and congratulated each other. The championship battle thus came to a close.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Amateur Pistol Shooting Association's Class C Championship featured eighteen competitors, both Chinese and foreign. The final was held yesterday, starting at 5:30 PM, with Chinese competitor Li Gongrui against Glaucl. Mr. Li is the brother of Shanghai pistol king Li Gongying. He recently came to Shanghai from South China. His demeanor is similar to that of his younger brother, and his skills are also steady and commendable. He reached the Class C final on his first appearance in the Shanghai shooting scene, which is quite remarkable. In yesterday's final, he and Mr. Glaucl initially formed a parallel situation, with alternating leads. At the end of the first half, Mr. Glaucl had 250 points, and Mr. Li had 242 points. The competition resumed at 9:30 PM. Mr. Li rose magnificently, and with a pistol in hand, he was full of potential. He rarely missed a shot, moving forward from behind to take the lead. He eventually won by a large margin of 500 to 381 over Mr. Glaucl. The highest score for Mr. Glaucl was 42, and for Mr. Li, it was 26. Mr. Li's victory was due to his greater average score.

<h3 id="e158">Last Seven Minutes: Soochow Overcomes McTyeire <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Soochow Almost Failed Last Night</p>
<p>36 to 33</p>
<p>Soochow vs. West China YMCA</p>
<p>Finals on Saturday</p>
<p>Last night's Class B Group 2 match between Soochow and McTyeire was crucial for determining the finals qualification. Soochow's performance was diminished due to unfavorable circumstances. Although they led 23 to 17 in the first half, Soochow only scored one point in the first thirteen minutes of the second half, while McTyeire scored fifteen, putting Soochow behind 24 to 22. The four to five hundred spectators were shocked and complained endlessly. After several hard battles, Soochow scored twelve consecutive points in the last seven minutes, finally winning 36 to 33. It was a close call! The cheers from the audience were even more enthusiastic.</p>
<p>(McTyeire frequently commits fouls) At the start, McTyeire frequently committed fouls, and Wu Guolin scored two consecutive baskets, giving Soochow an advantage. McTyeire actively resisted, showing no weakness. Kang, Deng, Mao, and Lei each displayed their talents, and Feng Nianhua and Sun Baoqing were not willing to fall behind, scoring three consecutive baskets, making the score 15 to 10, with Soochow leading by five points. At this time, Feng Nianhua suddenly suffered a foot injury and had difficulty walking, forcing him to leave the field. It can be said that fortunes are unpredictable and disasters are inconstant.</p>
<p>(Feng Nianhua leaves the field due to a foot injury) After Xiao Feng left the field, Lu Zhonghui and Lu Zhongen represented the forwards. From then on, they were evenly matched, each making contributions. The performance of both sides lacked brilliance. McTyeire lacked their usual courage, and Soochow also lacked their previous smooth style. Both were overly cautious, which made their movements unnatural. At the end of the first half, Soochow scored 23 points, and McTyeire scored 17 points.</p>
<p>(McTyeire's Major Player Ejected) As the second half began, Kang Deng first added a point for McTyeire.</p>
<p>Following that, Lu Zhongen of Soochow also returned a point. The back-and-forth battle saw little progress for either side. Wu Guolin of Soochow repeatedly shot, but all his shots missed the target. McTyeire's Mao Lei scored beautifully, and Kang Deng added another point, bringing the score to 23 to 24, with Soochow leading by only one point. But at this time, McTyeire's Bie Xupo was suddenly ejected for four fouls. With McTyeire losing this major player, everyone thought that Soochow could relax, but the reality was completely opposite to expectations.</p>
<p>(Soochow completely at a loss) After Bie Xupo left, he was replaced by Li Fu, and the game unexpectedly went smoothly. Kang Deng scored from afar, and the score suddenly exceeded Soochow's at 25 to 24. Mao Lei continued to contribute, making it 27 to 24. The foreign audience shouted wildly, very pleased. Seeing the unfavorable situation, Soochow called Feng Nianhua back in and replaced Lu Zhonghui, regaining their formation and trying to retaliate. But since Xiao Feng could not walk well, and the other players also seemed to be out of sorts, they attacked left and right, unable to get the ball into the basket, while McTyeire frequently broke through. Li Fu and Qin Bo scored successively, overwhelming Soochow with a large difference of 32 to 24.</p>
<p>(Seven Minutes to Reverse the Defeat) At this time, Soochow's bad luck had not ended. Lu Zhongen was also ejected for four fouls and was replaced by his younger brother, making the situation even more precarious, as if they were lost in a fog, not knowing what to do. Thirteen minutes had passed, with only seven minutes left. The audience was extremely anxious, stamping their feet and sighing. Soochow's players shook their heads and regretted. After several hard efforts and struggles, Feng Nianhua, with his injured foot, finally broke the deadlock. From then on, Soochow's spirit was greatly uplifted, and the cheers of support soared into the sky. The momentum then shifted, Sun Baoqing made two free throws, Wu Guolin scored three consecutive points, and Qian Jingyong and Feng Nianhua added five more points. The entire arena was filled with enthusiastic cheers and excitement.

<p>— Pan Yang'an</p>
<p>……………………………………</p>
<p>The invasion of foreign goods and the filling of every household with imported goods is an undeniable fact. Even in some so-called modern families, whether it be clothing, food, housing, or transportation, all daily necessities cannot go a day without foreign goods. Setting aside the many serious problems of economic loss and excessive outflow, it is shameful that in our so-called independent country, there are many people who cannot survive without foreign goods, and many families who cannot live without foreign goods. This despicable habit and abnormal phenomenon are truly shameful!</p>
<p>Moreover, the families most severely controlled by foreign goods are mostly composed of intellectuals. Some say that the higher the level of education, the more effort is put into promoting foreign goods. The so-called advanced members of society are the first to fall into this situation, which is a great loss to society. At a time when the whole country is trying to save the country from disaster, especially in this year designated as the National Products Year, we should resolutely eliminate this bad habit first.</p>
<p>In terms of the consumption of national products, families have always occupied an important position. The national products industry must find its own way out, and naturally, efforts must be made in all aspects of production and sales. However, if every family can have the determination to use national products, it may be a way to increase revenue for the future of national products. Therefore, engaging in the domestic national products movement in this national products campaign is of great significance.</p>
<p>Regarding the implementation of the domestic national products movement, as long as everyone removes the inferiority of worshiping imported goods, using national products in life is not very difficult. Moreover, many emerging national products are substitutes, and sometimes they are cheaper and better than foreign goods. Just look at all the products of the recently opened China National Products Company. We have already found practical proof that is better than mere debate. Therefore, if we can understand this principle, and if the national product production industry can provide instructions on substitutes or the general use of national products, we will not have to make as much sacrifice as the Indians wearing felt blankets.</p>
<p>As for promotion, the success of one family's attempt is far more effective than countless flyers and slogans. In the first step, we certainly hope that intellectual women will lead by example because the word of mouth of the general public is better than you going door to door to promote! Expanding gradually from one family to relatives and friends, if such a good custom is established, its success will certainly not be limited to a short time! And we men! Do not abandon our responsibilities because we do not care about family matters. It is easier to persuade your wife or sisters than to persuade the general public. Since we are willing to make efforts in this national products campaign, we should naturally start with our own families.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must pay attention to the domestic national products movement; in every family, establish the morality and belief of "I love national products, I buy national products, I use national products!"</p>

<h3 id="e163">The Recent Situation of the Sino-Japanese Cotton Industry <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Yin Ge</p>
<p>Recently, due to various factors such as war and floods, the Chinese cotton industry has been greatly affected, while the Japanese cotton industry in Shanghai has been even more depressed. Before the outbreak of the Shanghai war, Japanese merchants had 56,000 pieces in stock. Production was suspended for three months after the outbreak of the war. After resuming operations in April, sales were very limited due to strong resistance to Japanese goods in our country. Moreover, the independence of the puppet state's customs duties also had an impact on Japanese cotton yarn in Shanghai. In the past, resistance to Japanese goods could not last long because Chinese cotton yarn could only meet half of the demand. After about half a year, Japanese goods would definitely be sold well again. This time, however, it is different. The Dong'an incident was not resolved, and the Shanghai incident followed. The anti-Japanese movement is more profound. In addition, the Yangtze River flood and the development of national products are all sufficient to hinder the sales of Japanese cotton yarn. Therefore, the Japanese cotton industry in Shanghai is almost in a state of collapse. The cotton yarn produced by Chinese merchants has increased by 34,800 pieces per month, and the inventory has increased to more than 80,000 pieces, which is different from the Japanese factories' remaining 30,000 pieces. However, Japanese cotton yarn factories are well-managed, and their companies that operate the cotton industry have sales networks all over the world, making it easy to develop new markets. On the other hand, Chinese factories have less capital and fewer public reserves, and they often cannot proceed smoothly. It is hoped that they will help each other and study technology carefully to compete with the Japanese. Do not allow the enemy to invade due to negligence in the last five minutes. This will greatly benefit the future of the national economy.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Let Me Introduce a Few Kinds of Homespun Cloth <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Jingyu</p>
<p>Clothes are nothing more than tools to protect the body. As long as they are worn to cover the limbs and keep the body warm, they can be passable. Why must we use expensive materials and spend a lot of money! Then, if we want economical and durable fabrics, we should look to the homespun cloth produced in the countryside!</p>
<p>Speaking of homespun cloth, it originally belongs to the products of our Songjiang area. There are many different kinds and patterns! When the exhibition was held in Shanghai last year, the displayed homespun cloth reached more than one hundred and several tens of types, most of which were produced in our Songjiang area. And the counties of "Fengxian," "Nanhui," and "Chuansha" in Pudong are especially famous for producing homespun cloth! Taking our "Fengxian" as an example, the clothes that the villagers wear daily, which can be seen, have at least thirty or fifty kinds of colors and patterns. Recently, there are even some women with intelligent nature who have actually come up with new ideas and made inventions. They have slightly improved the existing looms and added foot pedals. (Originally two, now increased to four). From this, we can see that the yarn is increased, and the weaving is complicated; and the results produced are becoming more and more excellent! Now there are several new products that were not seen in last year's exhibition; and their ingenuity and pleasing appearance actually surpass foreign goods! I am here to introduce them to you, for the purchase of the national product company.</p>
<p>Water Wave Cloth: Its pattern is curved like waves in the water. To put it bluntly, it looks like a herringbone serge. It is woven with double-layer fine yarn, and its texture is thick and soft. It is best to make inner clothing! But it is also very elegant to dye it into colors and make long robes for men and women. At first glance, it is almost like serge, but it lacks luster.</p>
<p>Chicken Feather Towel: The color yarn is interspersed with white yarn to weave the shape of chicken feathers. It is quite beautiful for women to use as cheongsam! It is also very suitable for young men's jackets and children's clothing!</p>
<p>Eye Cloth: It is also made of colored yarn and white yarn, and the whole fabric is patterned as if it is full of human eyes. Clothes made of it are suitable for women and children!</p>
<p>Although I am not a member of the "Cloth Clothing Association," I am one of those who advocate cloth clothing. Since there is such a good homespun cloth at present, all of us Chinese people should unite and strive for frugality at this time of economic decline and repeated foreign insults! Engage in vegetarianism and cloth clothing. If there is a need, we should go to the national product company to purchase it, and donate the money saved as much as possible to the anti-Japanese volunteer army in the Northeast, so as to increase their courage to fight! And to relieve the national crisis!</p>

<h3 id="e165">Returning from the China National Products Company <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Chengxun</p>
<p>Every time I walk on Nanjing Road, which is dazzlingly lit by neon lights, I always see signs full of "European and American Goods" and "Western Products," which suffocate people. Since the China National Products Company was established a week ago, it has forcibly attracted batches of fellow countrymen who are fascinated by European and American styles, and they have deeply engraved the idea of "I love national products" in their minds. In this year of national crisis and flooding of imported goods, this is indeed a gratifying thing.</p>
<p>The history of Chinese people shouting "Promote national products" has been around for a long time, but there have been very few who have organized, principled, and down-to-earth to do something. The China National Products Company has united many well-known national product factories, gathered many talented people who are determined to save the country, and cooperated to do it near the three towering cannons, regardless of success or failure. Let's not expect it to have a huge effect, but at least it has given our compatriots a shot in the arm.</p>
<p>On the day the China National Products Company opened, I went to visit it. Judging from the fact that the customers or guests were so crowded that it was impossible to move, and the staff were so busy that they didn't even have time to eat, this unprecedented grand occasion was truly the supreme harvest of the national product industry. But whether it was the power of the words "Opening Discount of 10%" or indeed the stimulation of our compatriots' patriotism is a question? We should spend some effort to answer it.</p>
<p>Past facts tell us that the effect of all national product exhibitions cannot satisfy us very much. This is all caused by the organizers having profit-seeking ideas and our compatriots holding curious thoughts. To answer the above question, it all depends on the efforts of the company's executives and the sincere understanding of our compatriots.</p>
<p>We sincerely wish the China National Products Company can recover the declining national product industry and spread the seeds of saving the country in the minds of our compatriots!</p>

<h3 id="e166">The Eighteen Nineteen Rhyme <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Zhanlu</p>
<p>The Song of Matsuoka, the Japanese representative to the League of Nations, becomes eighteen when analyzed geometrically. Now, he is being questioned by the Special Committee of the Nineteen Nations about whether Manchuria is under Chinese sovereignty. Mr. Eighteen is embarrassed! Should he say yes? Should he say no? Should he say something from the Analects of Confucius, "Yes, or is it not?" Should he say something from ancient Chinese, "Yes, yes, no, no, not so,"? Alas! The Nineteen Committee stumped Mr. Eighteen! Make an Eighteen Nineteen rhyme:</p>
<p>Nail head meets iron head, eighteen meets nineteen; try asking Manchuria’s rights, is it China’s? If so, then say yes, otherwise, answer no: The two words “is” and “not”, weigh more than the nine tripods. Eastern eighteen master, how to answer nineteen? The cart has hit the wall, the sleeve shows elbow again! If the word “is” is uttered, Manchuria is not his; he admits himself as the aggressor, and this determines the cause of the war. If the word “not” is uttered, the gall would be as big as a dipper; will there be the power to declare war to the League of Nations? Not unique, but a couple, two nineteen: Lord Pingyuan went to Chu, accompanied by nineteen; League of Nations Special Committee, nineteen members. The ancient nineteen people, difficult to decide is or not; adding Mr. Mao, twenty wins over nineteen. Today’s nineteen people, want to determine is or not; there is one short master, eighteen versus nineteen. Whether is or not, the ambiguity cannot last; one short eighteen, maneuvering for long nineteen. Eighteen and nineteen, who wins and who loses? The win or loss is definitive, outside the pass it is not mine!</p>
<h3 id="e167">Reading on the Tram <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Shiyan Ye</p>
<p>| Can glimpse a bit of psychology |</p>
<p>Driven by hunger, I have to take the tram from Jing'an Temple to North Sichuan Road at around eight o'clock every morning, and then from North Sichuan Road back to Jing'an Temple after four o'clock in the afternoon, without stopping in the cold or heat, in the wind or rain, all year round.</p>
<p>On the tram in the morning, most of the passengers are Chinese and foreign male and female students from primary and secondary schools. The staff in the foreign firms, banks, and companies on the Bund, a long way to go, with a book in hand, is the best way to relieve boredom. I read books every day to relieve boredom, and there are many others who use this method to pass the time.</p>
<p>Among the students reading books, I find that there are more foreign students than Chinese students. The books read by Chinese students are mostly in Western languages. They open the book in front of them, sometimes staring at it and reciting it silently, sometimes looking up and reciting it. It can be seen that they are focused and enjoying it. Although they also carry books on Chinese language, history, geography, etc. in their schoolbags, it is rare to see them take them out to read. From this, we can prove that today's students like foreign languages more than Chinese, and today's schools also emphasize foreign language courses more than Chinese. Around the New Year's Day a few days ago, I suddenly saw that most of them were reading Chinese books. I was surprised by their change in reading attitude. Then I thought, oh! I understand! Aren't all schools busy with big exams at this time? Winter vacation is approaching, and all subjects must be tested and ended. They use their free time on the tram to read in time. Who says they are cramming at the last minute?</p>
<p>People in foreign firms, banks, and companies, the books they read are of the martial arts type, of the humorous romance type. They are fully focused, not looking to the side, enjoying it without hearing the rumbling of the tram or feeling the shaking of the tram body. The ticket inspector asks them for tickets, and they don't notice. The tram arrives at the Bund, and they forget to get off. These people are fascinated by martial arts and infatuated with love. This can be seen in general!</p>
<p>Modern women, they don't look like students because they don't carry schoolbags. But they carry a brand new hardcover book with gold lettering and sit with it haughtily. Occasionally, they browse through it, and they really do "browse" it, flipping back and forth, as if hoping to find something in "there are houses of gold in the book, there are faces like jade in the book." Some people say: This kind of behavior is deliberately done in a crowded place to show off, isn't reading Western books very fashionable? Isn't it very prestigious in front of many people who don't know Western languages? I say: I don't think so! Why take the heart of a small person to measure the belly of a gentleman? Also, they read letters instead of reading books. They take out a piece of clean white Western paper from a Western paper envelope, with lines of horizontal text written in blue ink. Every time they read a few words, they have to look up and look at the people in the car. I say that this attitude must be because there is something secret in the letter that they are afraid of being seen, so they are so defensive. According to psychologists who have deeply studied them, this is the same psychology as those who flip through hardcover books with gold lettering.</p>
<p>The cooks in the mansions, carrying baskets, take the tram to the grocery market, holding Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai, Meng Jiangnu, and reciting them loudly, as if reading for everyone to enjoy.</p>
<p>A few kinds of reading on a tram are enough to glimpse a bit of the psychology of the Chinese.</p>

<p>— Fei Ming</p>
<p>丨Important Notes for Contributors丨</p>
<p>No one wants a manuscript they poured their heart and soul into to be tossed into the wastepaper basket by the editor. The reason is simple: every contributor hopes to gain some spiritual and material reward from their submitted work.</p>
<p>If you want to investigate the reasons for failed submissions, you can't entirely blame your own lack of scholarship, nor can you accuse the editor of being unfair. It's simply because you've treated contributing purely as a business transaction, instead of seeing it as an "art," which shattered your hopes of publication. Therefore, we need to understand the art of contributing.</p>
<p>The first thing to know about contributing is to recognize your target audience, because every publication has its own personality and characteristics. Even within the Shen Bao, we know that each supplement has its own specific readership. If the manuscript you submit completely blends with the nature of the publication you're targeting, then you have a 70-80% chance of success.</p>
<p>Secondly, you must ensure that the submitted manuscript is original and unique, avoiding repeating what others have said and content that duplicates others' work. Especially pay attention to the writing published in the publication you intend to submit to. If your topic is something no one has written about before, then you have a great chance of gaining the applause and resonance you desire from the editor and readers.</p>
<p>To enrich the content of your writing, you must first focus on finding topics from your daily life. Sometimes, you will discover something you have never heard or thought of before from casual conversations with others, from reading newspapers and books, or even from your solitary musings. You can write it down at this moment, and it will be a wonderful masterpiece. Casually thinking about something and picking up a pen to write randomly cannot ensure that your submission will avoid the danger of ending up in the wastepaper basket.</p>
<p>Finally, pay attention to a general principle: do not let material desires overshadow your interest when writing. While you may hope to receive a considerable amount of material reward from your submission, if there is no interest, it is better not to write. Otherwise, even if your writing is published, the result will be disappointing to yourself.</p>

<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Kaijun was an honest young man. Once, his family moved to a new house. There were only his mother and him, plus a maid, a very simple household.</p>
<p>The afternoon of the second day after moving in, he was busy hanging mirror frames, pasting couplets, and arranging his study. His mother was helping on the side. At this moment, a young woman walked in from outside. She wore a black camel wool cheongsam with white edges around it, and a white velvet flower in her hair. Her face was delicate and appeared even more rosy and fair. Especially her charming eyes, watery and seemingly with the magic power to bewitch and captivate souls. She was not yet twenty years old, still possessing the youthful beauty of a girl. After greeting them, mother and son, she began to chat casually. They learned that she was the landlord's daughter-in-law, eloquent and friendly, making a good impression at first sight, very pitiable.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Kaijun's mother quietly told her son, "Beauty is fleeting, how true that is! Do you know that the landlord's daughter-in-law, named Juyun, is only nineteen this year and is already the most lonely widow in the world?" Kaijun was surprised and said, "What? Is she already a widow? Such a beautiful woman, such youthful years, how can she endure spending her life in such desolate loneliness? And what about her life in the future? Isn't her lifelong happiness already buried in the grave with her deceased husband?" After Kaijun finished speaking, he sighed deeply.</p>
<p>She often came over, either in the afternoon or in the evening, holding a cross-stitch frame, doing needlework while chatting with Kaijun's mother, as intimately as a family member. Gradually, she revealed her background and thoughts. According to her, she became a widow less than three years after getting married. Her husband's family was already declining, and her husband didn't know how to earn money when he was alive. Now that he was dead, her mother-in-law refused to give her a penny, only allowing her to eat plain rice, and even subjected her to constant nagging. The people in the family treated her like a stranger, and she had no one to rely on in her own family. The future was bleak and unimaginable. She was still young and wanted to do something to achieve an independent life, but she regretted that she had no education. She only graduated from elementary school and didn't continue her studies. Now, she needed it but had no opportunity to pursue education. Kaijun's mother showed her great sympathy and often comforted her with kind words. Kaijun, listening from the side, felt her life was extremely pitiful. If humans have sufficient empathy, they should think of ways to help such vulnerable people, people with such sadness buried in their hearts. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Peng Xuehai</p>
<p>Nanjing, since the success of the revolution, has donned a new outfit, like a middle-aged woman putting on modern clothes, focusing solely on appearances to flaunt herself before the shallow masses.</p>
<p>Several asphalt roads, wide enough to be appalling due to being based on the land of commoners, are filled with foreigners' cars driven by Chinese people. In this "Year of National Products," it's considered a unique embellishment. On the cobblestone roads beside them, rickshaws are filled with dignified armed comrades, exuding a leisurely attitude that makes you forget the stories of the volunteer army engaging in hand-to-hand combat in another corner because they lack equipment. Across the streets and along the walls and electrical poles, various slogans, both new and old, are posted and pasted. Slogans of saving the nation and resisting are the proper attitude of a land of benevolence and righteousness!</p>
<p>Hua Pai Lou (Ornamental Archway) is the most bustling area in the entire city, where foreign goods stores promoting national products, bookstores striving for culture, silk shops advocating thrift, and restaurants advocating reduced food intake are densely lined up on both sides, opening their mouths wide to devour people. The sidewalks are crowded with civil and military comrades wearing signs, holding their lovers in one hand and inspecting the goods in various stores with both eyes. Beggars and vagrants fill the streets and alleys. The pitiful cries for help and the agonizing cries of selling children fully represent the declining fate of the entire nation. But these sounds cannot cover up the smiles on the corners of the rulers' mouths.</p>
<p>Stepping into the Confucius Temple is like entering another world. Singing and dancing flourish, and life is still happy. The chaos of the shops beside the temple and the mud of the roads display the entire chaos of China. Tea houses and theaters are lined up in close rows. A few melodies of clear songs and a burst of laughter simply make one not believe in the so-called hatred of national subjugation. The famous Qinhuai River, with its whites of the eyes showing, lies coldly and unattended. Before and after the temple at the start of the new year, colorful paper lanterns fill the area, appearing lush and beautiful.</p>
<p>Quiet places are not non-existent, but they do not attract tourists. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum on Zijin Mountain, the tomb of Xiaoru on Yuhua Terrace, the Jiuming Temple for distant views, and the light boats on Xuanwu Lake are all sites with loyal martyrs. Our generation is ashamed to face the ancients!</p>
<p>Nanjing, a Nanjing like a riddle. Modern girls cannot compare to your charm, and beautiful young women cannot match your loveliness. Praise be to Nanjing, targeted by the enemy's cannons!</p>

<p>On the flat and wide Guanqian Street, the brilliance of electric lights and neon lights changes the color of the sky. Guanqian Corner at dusk already shows a prototype of Nanjing Road. Moreover, the captivating songs broadcast on the radio, such as "Selling Flowers," "Little Peach Red," and the Suzhou ballad "Sir, Miss," are played everywhere, one after another, from morning till night, spreading靡靡 melodies.</p>
<p>Young men of the times in suits with ironed straight lines, groups of modern girls with curly hair, roam the streets. Red velvet shirts, gray woolen coats, black velvet cloaks, red, green, black, and white clothes of various colors are reflected against the backdrop of the towering three- or four-story palace-like buildings. If it weren't for a few lurking beggars, Suzhou would truly be a splendid paradise!</p>
<p>In the Yuanmiao Taoist Temple, the incense smoke in the temple is densely packed all day long, gathering and not dispersing. Worshipping men and women come and go. The aromas of cooking, heating, steaming, boiling, and the various fragrant flavors of various food stalls float around to lure the silver coins and copper yuan in people's wallets, rolling away.</p>
<p>The strikingly dressed women selling themselves are often found under the "Notice of Strict Prohibition of Private Prostitution by the Public Security Bureau" in hotels. Indeed, according to recent investigations, the number of women selling their bodies inside and outside Suzhou has exceeded five hundred!</p>
<p>The cinemas and theaters in Beiju are always declared full. Whenever the iron gates are pulled open, the crowded audience always surges out like waves. The list of losses from the January 28th Shanghai Incident: "25,000 deaths, 200 million yuan in property losses" is posted on the wall of the Youth Association, but what is the use of dwelling on past events! The Suzhou people who go to the Youth Association to watch "Tears and Laughter" barely even glance at it!</p>

<h3 id="e174">Gold Market Entirely Dominated by Situation and Premium Before Swap <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>(Fluctuating, Better on the Rise) The gold market, after falling the day before, saw London overseas cables report rises of about 25 on both near and deferred dates in the morning. Exchange rates for both British-US and US-British rose. New York silver rose .375, the deferred silver rate rose by 2.7 points and the US Cotton fell by more than ten points. The opening exchange rate was .0625 tighter than the previous close and confidence returned. The opening price was immediately high, at 794.3 taels. The market was extremely steady, fluctuating around 4 or 5 taels as the banks bought and sold. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) rates were released, with both Sterling and US exchange rates unchanged. Gold prices hovered around 5 taels. Pre-market preparation was being done for the start of this swap period. Gold prices rose and fell along with the highs and lows of the premium. Overseas cables said the Japanese military had delivered an ultimatum to our country, demanding that troops stationed in Jehol be withdrawn. The situation was serious and people began to panic again. However, because trading was light and the swap required the offer of a premium, although there were price fluctuations, the power of the sellers was not strong. Therefore, after the price reached 792 taels, Run Changyu, acting on behalf of the Central Bank, opened up with actual gold on two occasions, totaling 210 bars, which raised the price. The market closed near the close with a slightly stronger buying trend, closing at a price of 795.6 taels. It was observed that the market was extremely stable in the morning and afternoon. Although it had fallen slightly due to the situation, the short positions were satisfied due to the swap relationship, and it stabilized again. The swap from February to March was transacted at 2.8 mace in the exchange and outside the exchange Hengxing offered the Central Bank 4 taels, with over 400 bars traded. Therefore, the premium for this swap period was also standing at around 4 taels. The lowest premium for this swap period was 2.8 mace, and the highest was 4 taels, with 烚赤 calculated at an additional 13.5 to 14 taels, as spot traders were seeking to secure goods to cover positions. At this time, the Central Bank had not yet released the February long positions, so the premium for this swap period was viewed as level. The market situation for the morning and afternoon is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(Situation Devastation, Swap Stabilized) The morning opening was at 794.3 taels, an increase of 2.7 taels from the previous close. This was because the rise in silver prices in the US was not satisfactory, and confidence was stabilizing. The opening price of goods was 794.5 taels. The opening exchange rate was tighter than the previous close, calculated with the near-term offer price for Sterling at 1 shilling 7 and 75 points, and the US exchange rate at 28.3125 yuan. The price gradually rose to 5.2 mace. Hengyu and Yongfeng sold bars, at 4 mace. Yuanmao, Yongheng, and Yu also offered, reaching within 4 mace, at 3.6 mace. Dadecheng advanced to 4.5 mace. Shengda slightly offered, still around 4 mace. The US exchange rate for March was required by the bank at 28.375 yuan. Fuchang and Fuyu advanced to 5 mace. Dadecheng purchased bars up to 5.5 mace. At this point, a sudden drop occurred. News favorable to silver prices from overseas cables was received. Yifeng and Yongyuanchun, etc., sold bars one after another, falling as low as 3 mace. However, the cable ended by saying that this 　 had not yet passed. The sellers immediately came back to buy. Gold prices rose again. Qianchangxiang slightly advanced, to 4 mace. Pangen ate the US exchange rate for April at 4.375. Zhifeng and Yong also slightly took delivery, improving to 5 mace. Citibank sold the US exchange rate for February at 3.75 to Huabi. Daxing and Yonglai sold, reaching 4.1 mace. Before long, the HSBC rate was released, with both Sterling and US exchange rates unchanged. Confidence seemed stable, gradually rising to 5 mace. Citibank continuously sent out the US exchange rate for March at 3.75, seeing a downstream result. Mitsui sold the April rate at 4.375, hovering around 4 mace. After this, this swap period opened, with the shorts offering a premium of 3.5 to 4 mace, then rising and falling with the high and low of the premium. Because the exchange transaction was piecemeal, major accounts were all paying attention to the swap. After a long delay, overseas cables reported that the Japanese military had delivered an ultimatum to our country, demanding the withdrawal of troops stationed within Jehol. The situation became tense again. In an instant, selling winds were intense. Daxing, Yong, Yuanmao, Yong, Zhifeng, and Yong all came to sell off, but the quantities were small. Fellow traders were at a loss. It fell by more than two taels, stopping at 792 taels. This was because the swap premium had risen from within 3 mace to 3.5 mace, and the sellers were satisfied. Qianchangxiang, Hengyu, and Run Changyu all bought, raising the price to beyond 3 mace, with a slight detour. Hengyu continued to take delivery of a small number, again beyond 3 mace. Hengxing advanced bars to 4 mace. Yuanmao, Yongchun, and Yuanyong also advanced, to 4.7 mace. The exchange market was still good at this time. MacGall drew 5.625 for May. Hengxing suddenly came to sell off. Although Yuanheng bought, the price was still small, then at 3.8 mace. Trading was extremely clear, hovering briefly. Hengxing suddenly advanced after selling, to 4.5 mace, then bought again at 5.3 mace. Huabi sold the US exchange rate for March at 3.75. Dadecheng came to sell, at 4.5 mace. Shengda and Qianchangxiang also sold, retreating into 4 mace, at 3.8 mace. After this, it gradually approached closing. Both sides lacked interest. Gold prices rose and fell mutually outside 4 mace. Finally, a buying wind suddenly arose. Dadecheng frantically bought again and again, then pulled it outside 5 mace, peaking at 5.7 mace. Before long, the noon close was at 795.6 taels. Goods were knocked off at 5.7 mace. There was no business in the afternoon because it was Wednesday. Although there were minor disturbances in the morning and afternoon, the overall trend was extremely level. The highest price was 795.7 taels, the lowest was 792 taels, with a fluctuation of 3.7 taels. The result was an increase of 4 taels compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>(Posted price lower than previously lowered 4 taels) Because the HSBC posted rate did not move, the US exchange rate was still calculated at 27.875 yuan, totaling a gold price of 860 taels 9 mace 9 fen. According to the closing price, it was about 65 taels lower, 4 taels lower than the previous close. The registration for this month was 797 taels, the registration for March was 796 taels, and the water compensation was 799 taels.</p>
<p>(Pay attention to the waning of swap trading) On the 　 market, trading was still strong at first. Later, due to the pre-preparation for the swap, all firms paid attention to the swap, and trading decreased. In total, Dadecheng, Fuchang, Fuyu, Yuanheng, Yuankang, Xiang, Zhaofeng, Changchun, Yuanyong, Qianchangxiang, etc., all轧進 (advanced). Yuanmao, Yongshengda, Hengyu, Daxingyong, Bingxing, Wanxing, Yifengyong, Yuanyongchun, etc., all had 轧出 (discharged). The Dalian gang and Guangdong gang did not have large transactions. Although Hengxing occasionally advanced slightly, all the amounts were small. Approximately, advances were more than discharges, while Shengda was the opposite. As of the previous day, the total for March was 16,807 bars.</p>
<p>(烚赤 volume not weak) Yesterday, due to the swap relationship, spot merchants Yingfenghong, Tongfenghong, etc., all took delivery, while guest gangs and goldsmith gangs sold. Prices started at an additional 13.5 taels and rose to 14 taels, with robust transactions. Yingfenghong advanced 13.5 taels, and Tongfenghong took delivery of 14 taels.</p>
<p>(February remaining volume over 1,600) Yesterday, from February to March, the same industry paid attention to the March to April swap, and there were fewer formal transactions. The premium was 3.8 mace offered by the shorts. Ruikang offered Tongfenghong 56 bars. Hengxing still wanted to offer after entry, but did not find a counterparty. As of the 14th, the remaining volume for February was still over 1,600 bars. Outside the market, the Central Bank has continued to release long positions. It is calculated that Hengxing offered 4 taels, with 448 transactions.</p>
<p>(Swap premium to be 4 taels) Gold for March designated to April, the premium was slightly the same as in February, offered by the shorts. Initially, the offered offer was 3.8 to 4 mace, but there were few formal transactions. Hengxing first came to advance the offer, and Dalian gang's Shunli spot traders Run Changyu, etc., followed suit and swapped out long positions, and the premium immediately decreased. Hengxing only offered 3.3 mace, with few transactions. Run Changyu offered within 3 mace, and once called out 2.5 mace, but there were no transactions. After entry, it gradually returned upward. Qianchangxiang also came to advance the offer, and slightly stabilized outside 3 mace. Zhifengyong, etc., all came to offer, then hovering and rising. At this time, there were few long positions, and the shorts became anxious. It gradually increased to 3.89 mace. Chunyuanyong came to advance the offer, or acting on behalf of the spot trader Tongfenghong. Although Zhifengyong continued to offer, Hengxing came to limit the market and swap. It stood at around 4 mace. Changshengyong and Yifengyong once paired at 4 mace, but only 7 transactions. The Dalian gang still came to advance the offer, and retreated to around 3.5 mace. After this, it gradually became peaceful. However, because of the lack of long positions, the general retail shorts offered particularly eagerly, so the price also rose. At this time, Zhifengyong offered according to the posted rate, once increasing by 3 fen over the posted rate, offering Hengxing a large number. It was reduced to a 12-fen increase, Hengxing advanced by posting according to the posted rate. Nearing the close, Dadecheng, Fuchang, etc., all came to offer, rising to 4 mace, and Hengxing advanced. Unable to rise further, the bulls with Hengxing, Qianchangxiang, Shunli, and Chunyuanyong mostly swapped out. Hengxing swapped out about 1,500 bars today. The shorts with Zhifengyong, Dadecheng, and Fuchang swapped in the most, estimated that Zhifengyong was about 2,000. Fuchang emptied about 800, generally swapping completely. Today is the formal entry, and the premium may not have a large difference, but the trend seems to be slightly higher. However, the degree of increase is limited because the Central Bank is willing to swap.</p>

The Sterling exchange rate was 1 shilling 7 pence 75, and the US exchange rate was 28.3125 yuan, both tightening .0625 compared to the previous close. After opening, it was extremely level. Although Citibank continued to offer, those advancing still had strength, so there was only a slight rise and fall between the advance and offer prices. HSBC's posted rates were unchanged. The market continued to be level. When the overseas cable news of the Japanese military's ultimatum came, gold prices fell, but the exchange market had no special changes except for Zhongfu's offer of US exchange rate for April at 28.5 yuan. Banks such as Citibank, Mitsui, and Zhongfu all sent out US exchange rates. Huabi offered shillings, and Citibank took shillings. Buyers, in addition to the gold industry, were all retail. It is calculated that MacGall, Mobil, Holland, and Zhejiang all slightly took delivery. The half-day process was extremely level, with few changes. The first time US exhcange rate for April was 4.375, then was 0.5 yuan, only .0625 difference. Closing offer prices were Sterling near term 1 shilling 7 pence 6875 (or 75), US exchange rate 28.3125 yuan, about .125 tighter (shilling) and .0625 (US exchange rate) than the previous close.

<h3 id="e177">US Silver Subsidiary Coin Plan <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Ratio is One-Sixteenth</p>
<p>Washington, February 14th dispatch. The US House of Representatives Subsidiary Coin Committee has collected various proposals for silver subsidiary coins to create a kind of independent silver subsidiary coin with a ratio of one-tenth for deliberation. This case will form another review committee to determine the silver reserve method for this coin. Chairman of the Subsidiary Coin Committee, 生茂斯 (Sheng Maosi), said that the main point of the review committee is to stipulate the relationship between silver reserves and the treasury and to protect the treasury from maintaining the abandonment of silver. Lin Nai, the leader of domestic flour in the House of Representatives, supported Sheng Maosi's opinion, saying that he supported the coin being made of silver.</p>
<h3 id="e178">The Abolition of the "Li" and Change to the Yuan System Brings Minimal Change to Interest Rates <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Market Situation: Yesterday's market saw little activity in both silver and copper transactions. This was largely because the rising calls for the abolition of the "li" were expected to be implemented soon. Various firms were preparing adequately, eliminating the need for further transactions. Additionally, most commercial ventures and departments had not yet expanded, resulting in a sluggish demand for funds, which was expected. Hence, the market was quiet and approaching a period of extreme calm.</p>
<p>Interest Rates Remain the Same: Due to the quiet trading in silver and copper, the "foreign interest" rate remained the same throughout the morning and afternoon at 7 qian, 1 fen, 4 li, 8 hao, and 7 hu and a half. This was a slight improvement of 1 hao and 2 hu and a half compared to the previous day's market price. As the abolition of the "li" drew closer, the rate could not deviate too far from the standard interest rate (7.15), preventing significant fluctuations. "Silver interest" saw limited use and few drafts, ultimately leading to ample silver supply. Interest rates remained at zero for both morning and afternoon, with no added commission.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Currency Stable: The Jiangnan small silver dollar fluctuated slightly, rising two li in the afternoon market to 6 qian, 2 fen, and 2 li, before dropping back two li to 6 qian and 2 fen. Trading volume was 6,500 jiao in the morning and 3,000 jiao in the afternoon. The Guangdong small silver dollar was priced at 5 qian, 9 fen, and 1 li in the morning and 5 qian, 9 fen, and 0.75 hao in the afternoon. Trading volume was 60,000 jiao in the morning and 20,000 jiao in the afternoon. Copper coins remained at 419,000 wen, with a trading volume of 50,699 strings, equivalent to 12,100 taels of silver.</p>
<p>Silver Deposits Quiet: Yesterday was also quite quiet for banks in terms of silver deposits. Chinese merchants deposited over 1.6 million taels, foreign merchants over 2 million taels, advances over 900,000 taels, special deposits between 2.7 and 2.8 million taels, and collateral transactions over 900,000 taels. Deposits for various goods, remittances, customs duties, and miscellaneous items totaled between 6.6 and 6.7 million taels, with 800,000 taels withdrawn. Silver firms and public offices deposited over 24 million taels, silver commission deposits over 3.1 million taels, remittances from various regions over 400,000 taels, and cash deposits over 600,000 taels.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Transactions Sluggish: Yesterday's trading volume in both markets was low. Remittance drafts totaled 560,000 in the morning and 565,000 in the afternoon. Banknotes totaled 40,000 in the morning and 45,000 in the afternoon. Over-the-counter banknotes totaled 85,000 in the morning and 20,000 in the afternoon. Order transactions totaled 30,000 in the morning and 10,000 in the afternoon. Bank transactions totaled 550,000 in the morning and 450,000 in the afternoon for inter-bank trading. Transactions between banks and foreign accounts totaled over 900,000. Banknote recalls and issuances totaled over 1.3 million. Foreign collateral transactions totaled over 700,000. Customer sources totaled 150,000. Foreign exchange deposits at money shops totaled over 4.4 million. Foreign exchange commission deposits totaled over 1.3 million. Foreign exchange borrowing and lending totaled over 1.2 million. Small money shop transactions totaled over 500,000.</p>
<p>Overall, given that the abolition of the "li" system will be implemented on March 1st, there will be no significant changes to the current foreign interest rates. Although the abolition of the silver system on July 1st is still some time away, most people are hesitant to open new silver accounts, making ample supply a necessary outcome.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Securities Market in Turmoil Due to Rehe Crisis; Public Bonds Fall While Troop Reduction Bonds Alone Soar <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>丨Loss of Two Yuan and Change丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the public bond market at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange remained weak. The ever-changing diplomatic atmosphere caused widespread anxiety. Sellers were wary of a potential squeeze at the end of the month and were also mindful of the buying activity in the banking sector, leading to some caution. Buyers, on the other hand, feared an irreparable breakdown in Sino-Japanese relations, causing prices to fluctuate unpredictably. Trading volume was low in the morning session, with most firms adopting a wait-and-see approach. Prices fluctuated by only three to five jiao. Before the second session opened, news broke that Japan was about to issue an ultimatum, demanding the withdrawal of Chinese troops from Rehe within a specified timeframe. The Commodity Exchange, which trades futures contracts, closed early, experiencing a sharp drop of two yuan. The second session at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw an even more dramatic decline, with Troop Reduction Bonds plummeting by a significant three yuan. This triggered widespread panic. Later, as contracts No. 38 and No. 21 covered their short positions, the decline slowed slightly, but still remained at one to two yuan. The public bond market was turbulent. The afternoon sessions were relatively stable, but fluctuations of around one yuan persisted. The overall trend remained inconsistent. For example, Troop Reduction Bonds initially rebounded by about one yuan after opening but then lost momentum, closing with a slight gain of a few jiao. This reflected the uncertainty in the market, leading to inconsistent prices. The difference between the high and low points within each session often exceeded one yuan, indicating a growing sense of disorder in the market. By the end of the day, prices had fallen by an additional six to seven jiao to over two yuan. Contract No. 20 experienced a slight decrease of only six jiao, while Troop Reduction Bonds alone plummeted by over two yuan. The total trading volume amounted to 9,200,062 yuan, with spot trading accounting for 1,200 yuan. Troop Reduction Bonds (futures) and contract No. 19 accounted for over 2.8 million yuan. Unified salt tax bonds accounted for over 5.025 million yuan. Both contract No. 20 and No. 21 also exceeded one million yuan, while the remaining contracts ranged from ten to seventy thousand yuan.</p>

<p>According to the report from Sin Fung Company, the New York stock market on Tuesday (14th) experienced a sharp decline due to the financial crisis in Michigan. The governor was forced to order a statewide bank holiday for eight days, during which all banks, trust companies, and other financial institutions were closed. Automotive companies were directly affected, leading to concentrated selling of automotive stocks. Except for gold mining stocks, all stocks were impacted. The market rebounded slightly before closing as short sellers covered their positions. As a result, Auburn Automobile fell by $2.5, Chrysler and General Motors fell by $1.5, Citibank fell by over $2, and Union Carbide fell by $4. Trading volume was brisk throughout the day, totaling 1,540,000 shares. The closing prices of the Dow Jones averages are listed below:</p>

<p>A Glimmer of Hope Appears in the Future Market</p>
<p>The yarn market continues to be plagued by sharp declines. Due to Reuters reports that Japan has demanded the withdrawal of our troops from Rehe, panic has suddenly gripped the market, leading to a surge in selling and renewed disorder. Many are painfully liquidating their positions, causing market prices to fall and long positions to collapse. However, some believe that if sales can be stimulated, the market can stabilize, as prices have already fallen by six to seven taels compared to their peak. Nevertheless, the substantial inventory exerts significant pressure.</p>
<p>(Near-Month Yarn Continues to Fall Two Taels) The opening of the Shanghai Yarn Exchange was subdued due to falling U.S. cotton prices. Around the third transaction, rumors of a deteriorating political situation emerged, triggering a sudden drop in prices and widespread chaos. Near-month contracts fell by 1.5, 7, and 9 qian, while far-month contracts fell by 1.23 qian. In the afternoon, some profit-takers covered their positions, causing the market to rebound by 5 and 7 qian. Trading volume was very active throughout the day, totaling 61,400 bales. Sales included 1,600 bales of Mingde, 2,400 bales of Gengfeng, 1,400 bales of Senkang, 2,150 bales of Changfeng, 1,400 bales of Yuande, 950 bales of Delong, and 950 bales of Tonghe. Purchases included 1,500 bales of Tongji, 1,850 bales of Lichang, 2,600 bales of Taichang, 3,350 bales of Yichang, and 1,000 bales of Huachang. The closing prices are as follows:</p>

<p>April 1410     43.850</p>
<p>Total    187.650</p>
<p>(Little Improvement in Yarn Sales) Spot yarn sales remain sluggish. Total sales for the day by various firms are estimated at 594 bales, with prices falling by 2.5 to 5 qian. The purchase volumes of various firms are as follows:</p>
<p>Yunnan 150, Anqing 57, Guangdong 165, Wuhu 5, Xiamen 20, Inland 145, Nanyang 15, Ningbo 2, Peers 25, Haizhou 10</p>
<p>The cotton market experienced a sharp decline due to falling foreign cotton prices and worsening political news. This has caused anxiety among holders of long positions. However, gold prices are high, and there is a relative shortage of locally produced cotton. Some firms are still holding onto their distant-month Indian cotton positions without releasing them in large quantities. The future of cotton cloth will depend on the trends in foreign cotton prices and exchange rates.</p>
<p>(Distant-Month Cotton Futures Fall Three and a Half Qian) The opening of the Zhengzhou Cotton Exchange was subdued due to falling U.S. and Indian cotton prices. In the second and third transactions, the sharp decline in yarn prices dragged down cotton prices, causing contracts for all months to fall by 2, 3, and 4. In the afternoon, some profit-takers covered their positions, causing prices to rise by 1.5 qian. Total trading volume for the day is estimated at 100,059 dan. Sales included 7,800 dan of Changfeng, 5,800 dan of Gengfeng, 3,600 dan of Yuanxingchang, and 4,500 dan of Changhe.

<p>丨Guangdong Firms Experiment with Red Brown Rice丨</p>
<p>Shanghai South: Yesterday's supply only came from thirty odd firms, and sales were not brisk. Suzhou and Tongxiang rice firms still hope to boost sales, so they have raised prices again. Other goods have stabilized, but without proper sales channels, market conditions will be difficult to improve. Bao Wei rice temporarily stalled due to rumors of Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations and tense situations in Pingjin. The amount of Bo Dao rice traded today was extremely small and was part of the broker's attempt to increase the amount in the godowns, rather than actual sales. Lu Yang tip rice has also stabilized. Tong Bian Yin Yuan rice has not yet recovered.</p>
<p>Shanghai North: Yesterday, 33 or 34 boats arrived from the lower reaches of the river. Bai Geng High Grade rice saw a slight decline in short-term prices, with continued transactions in medium and low grades. High-grade prices are now weak, while medium and low grades are holding steady. Bo Dao and early rice sales are flat, with prices remaining stable. There are continued arrivals of Yang Jian tip rice. Small lots sold well, and prices are also stable. Medium and low grades are tight. Bu Du tip rice saw a price increase of a few fen. Yin Yuan rice is weak. Bai Yuan rice arrivals were low, and sales were brisk, with a price increase of 2 jiao. Because it was a rainy day, the amount of Tian Gong rice was few.</p>
<p>Customer Rice: Yesterday morning, due to abundant arrivals, prices continued to decline. Transactions in Fujian rice remained quiet. This morning, firms in this street purchased 700 bags of Hunan machine-processed red rice at 8 yuan and 2 jiao and 5 fen, with prices down slightly by 1 jiao. In the afternoon, a customer from Guangdong suddenly came to the market to inquire about purchasing 500 bags of Hunan red brown rice at 6 yuan and 8 jiao. The selling price was quite cheap. It is said that the rice being experimented with by the Guangdong firm is used by distilleries. Future transactions are unlikely to continue, but the sales by this street were not weak yesterday. In the afternoon, another 514 bags of Hunan machine-processed red rice were purchased at 8 yuan, 3 jiao, and 5 fen, 450 bags of Jiangxi machine-processed late rice were purchased at 8 yuan, 7 jiao, 4 fen to 8 yuan, 5 jiao, and 26 bags of early rice were purchased at 7 yuan and 4 jiao. There were also 100 bags of Nanjing indica rice purchased at 7 yuan and 7 jiao, which were also purchased by this street. Prices were all down by 1 jiao to several fen.</p>
<h3 id="e185">The Flour Market Changes Three Times in One Day <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>丨Initial Decline Followed by Increase, Then Weakness in the Afternoon丨</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market initially declined after opening, followed by an increase. Due to the decline of the foreign wheat quotations by 3 jiao, the opening sentiment for this month was not stable. The initial price was only 1 tael, 7 qian, and 6.5 fen. However, due to purchases by Tianjin firms, it rebounded to 7 qian, 7 fen, and 7.5 li. The opening price for distant-month contracts was stable, and the decline in this month recovered. Tianjin firms were still inquiring after the second session. As a result, the current month reached 7 qian and 9 fen, and the March/April contracts were better than the initial price by one fen. However, the market weakened again when it opened in the afternoon because Fu Feng sold in all the sessions, and the amounts were high. Speculators also did not change wheat prices, and the trend was still to sell. Therefore, those getting rid of it were also busy. As a result, spot flour mills, Bingchuan Lao Che brands still added 3 fen, and miscellaneous brands added 1 fen. As a result, March was slightly better by 5 li, March/April remained unchanged, May was slightly down by 2.5 li, June was slightly down by 5 li, and July remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Wheat Declines in the Morning and Rebounds in the Afternoon <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures initially declined, followed by stabilization. The morning sessions saw a decline in sentiment due to the decline in foreign wheat quotations by a slight 3 jiao. The opening price for this month declined by 2 fen, while the March/April contracts also declined by 1 or 2 fen. July fell to as low as 1 qian and 7 fen, also a decline of 2 fen. When the market opened in the afternoon, sentiment improved slightly due to the recovery in flour futures in the morning, and the atmosphere was relatively stable. As a result, some floats recovered, and the opening prices for each month were better than the morning by 1 or 2 fen. As a result, the February/March contract was the same as the previous day, the April/May/June contract had no comparison, and July remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Soybean Cake Sales Gradually Increase <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, soybean cake transactions were active, with sales to the interior remaining sluggish, while sales to Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Xiamen were slightly better. Market conditions initially declined but were slightly better. Yellow soybeans remained flat and weak, with sales not satisfactory. Arrival was scarce. Therefore, it was internally stable and externally weak. The procurement of Mung beans from Yantai was continuing. More than 1,000 packages were sold yesterday. In Jiangbei, clear intergrown hairy beans traded at 3 taels, 2 qian, and 4 fen. The Guang firm agreed to purchase 400 packages of medium-grain Guandian vegetable Mung beans. The local wheat was lacking, but there was a supply of Wenzhou and Taizhou wheat. Therefore, the market was stable.</p>
<p>According to Reuters London on the 14th, soybean prices were £6 11s 3d per ton for February, £6 12s 6d for March, and £6 11s 9d for April.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Northern and Southern Goods: High Price Increase Due to Scarcity of Honey Dates <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>丨Lanxi Bald Dates Open at 38 Taels丨</p>
<p>Honey dates have been in short supply recently, and inventory is thin. Therefore, the market suddenly felt a shortage. Demand exceeded supply, and prices have been rising gradually. The reason for the shortage can be traced back to the year before last. Because production was too high, prices fell to just over 10 taels by the spring of last year, causing major losses for the cargo owners. As a result, last year's production was greatly reduced, resulting in the current high prices. Yesterday, Lanxi bald dates were sold for 38 taels, and some were expecting prices to reach 40 taels. The upper and lower tiers still added rebates as usual, and the trend is strong.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Sugar Market: Coarse Sand White Sugar Opens at Over 2,000 <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>丨Cheaper Compared to the Fixed Price丨</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market was weak due to further declines in the bid price. The initial fixed price for number 24 coarse sand white sugar was 15 taels, 6 qian, and 5 fen. Then it was slightly down, decreasing 2 fen and 5 li to 6 qian, 2 fen, and 5 li. High-grade sugar was 15 taels and 7 qian and 5 fen. At the same time, Jinfu opened over 2,000 packages at a price of 6 taels and 0.05 fen. The new import duty was cheaper than the fixed price. There were many recipients. Number 20 medium sand white sugar was 15 taels and 3 qian. Number 18 had no goods. Due to poor sales, Dutch red sugar was slightly down. Numbers 8 and 9 were 12 taels and 2 or 3 qian. Number 10 was 12 taels and 5 qian. Taikoo car sugar B mark was 16 taels and 4 qian and 5 fen. CW mark was 16 taels and 2 qian and 5 fen. DY mark and HX mark were 16 taels to 15 taels and 9 qian. Chao Qing in Shanghai was weak due to rare sales. However, according to a telegram from the local cargo owner, there was a temporary guard without unloading. It can be seen that the feet are still firm. The future market may not be easy. Some cargo customers in Zhangdiao Qing were still trying to pull the price over 10 taels. However, in light of the current facts, it is extremely difficult to achieve.</p>

<p>Since the enamel factory purchased black iron sheets, the market price of black iron sheets has increased. Most of the future goods that have recently arrived have been purchased by the enamel factory. The standard 26-foot sheets are estimated at 9 taels and 5 qian per dan, while the 36-foot sheets range from 8 taels, 2 qian, and 5 fen to 9 taels and 2 qian and 5 fen. The deputy goods that used to be plentiful in the market have also recently been sold out. Therefore, in order to prevent future shortages, fellow dealers are ordering forward contracts from overseas. It was heard that the price of the forward cargo arriving in March and April was £10 05s per ton. Based on the current foreign exchange calculations, there is little profit to be made. However, it is not possible to predict whether the future market will continue to be strong. It is said that this order was placed by hardware stores along North Suzhou Road.</p>

<p>Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have always been famous silkworm farming areas in China. In recent years, silkworm farming in various regions has repeatedly failed, and the rural economy is on the verge of bankruptcy. Mulberry fields in Wuxi have been converted to growing rice, and farmers are very discouraged about silkworm farming. This spring, the amount of silkworm cocoons raised will inevitably be drastically reduced. The government is now actively providing relief. The silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces had previously requested an exemption from the Jiangsu-Zhejiang silkworm seed transportation and sales tax in order to reduce costs for farmers. It has now been learned that this proposal has been approved by the Ministry of Finance, and the heads of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Finance Bureaus have already been instructed to order their subordinates to comply. However, this is limited to improved seeds that have passed inspection, so the improved silkworm seeds produced by various seed production areas in Jiangsu and Zhejiang can be freely transported and sold in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces without paying taxes.</p>

<h3 id="e192">Methods for Identifying Evergreen Thick Serge - Hua An <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>(Uses) Among woolen materials, evergreen thick serge is like coarse cloth among cotton textiles. Because of its wide sales, low price, strong quality, wear resistance, and washability, it is particularly valuable because its color does not change even when exposed to sunlight or immersed in water. Therefore, all uniforms and simple suits are popular.</p>
<p>(Colors) Its colors vary from dark to light, including several types such as Fast Blue, Indigo, and Commercial Indigo. Fast Blue means "does not fade" or "evergreen." Indigo is a blue dye extracted from coal. Commercial Indigo is produced by processing and refining Indigo, so its dyeing price is more expensive than the previous two. However, its color is durable and does not change its original color even after being boiled with extremely strong soap, so U.S. naval officers' uniforms and summer uniform collars must be made of this type of serge. Other types are not needed. The effectiveness of Indigo is slightly less, and Fast Blue is even less. The woolen stores in the Qipan Street area of Shanghai mostly sell the latter two types (Fast Blue, Indigo). The first type (Commercial Indigo) is sold by woolen cargo companies in the Hongkou Peng Road area. The price is about one yuan more per yard than the common type.</p>
<p>(Quality) This type of serge is produced by various countries, especially the British products, which are superior and slightly more expensive. The products of Germany, France, Italy, the Czech Republic, Japan, and other countries are cheaper and of poorer quality. Most of the serge sold in the market is produced in Germany, France, Italy, and other countries. Such products as Tianyou, Baoke, Dongfang, Yongxing, Tianfu, and other brands are sold at prices ranging from 3 yuan to 8 yuan per yard. British-made products such as Deji, Gongping, Yongle, and Linnan range from 5, 6 yuan to over 10 yuan per yard. The price is based on the thickness of the quality, the softness and firmness of the hair, and the durability of the color. The Shanghai Zhanghua Woolen Mill also produces domestic products, which are dyed and woven in Shanghai using foreign wool. The price is about 6 or 7 yuan per yard and is usable. No matter what kind of woolen material it is, to test its quality, you can take the yarn and pull it. The stronger the pull, the longer the wool fiber, which is a good product. Otherwise, it is a poor-quality product. The products of Italy, France, and other countries are sometimes made from recycled old wool. The pulling force is weak, and it breaks as soon as it is pulled. The fiber is also short.</p>
<p>(Shrinkage) Thick serge shrinks a lot. Some will shrink 1 to 2 inches per yard when put in water, so it must be sprayed with water during tailoring to avoid shrinkage after washing. British-made products shrink better. Those with the English words "Shrunk" or "London Shrunk" on the loom head have already undergone the shrinking process. Indigo and Commercial Indigo also have gold lettering on the loom head or every five yards. Pay special attention when purchasing.</p>

<h3 id="e216">The Advantages and Disadvantages of Electricity <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— He Jia'gan</p>
<p>During the Shogunate era in Japan, Christians were massacred on a large scale, and the punishments were extremely cruel, but it was not allowed to be published, and the world knew nothing about it. It was not until recent years that many historical documents were published. I once saw "The Record of the Martyrdom of Christians," which recorded the torture of Christians. They were either taken to the side of a hot spring and scalded with hot water, or a fire was lit around them and slowly roasted. This was originally a fire torture, but the person in charge moved the fire away and changed the death penalty to torture.</p>
<p>China has even more cruel methods. Tang dynasty novels record that a county official tortured a prisoner by roasting him with fire from all sides. If he was thirsty, he would be given vinegar to drink, which was a step further than Japan. Nowadays, when officials interrogate suspects, they use chili juice to pour into their nostrils, which seems to be a method left over from the Tang dynasty. I once saw a letter from a young man imprisoned in a reformatory, saying that he had suffered this torture before, and the pain was unbearable. The spicy juice flowed into his lungs and heart, and he had become terminally ill. Even if he was released, he would still die. This person was an army student and did not understand the structure of the internal organs. In fact, hanging upside down and pouring juice into the nose can flow into the lungs through the trachea, causing a fatal illness, but it cannot enter the heart. It is probably because this person was in pain and his senses were confused, so he suspected that it had reached his heart.</p>
<p>However, the cruelty of torture devices created by civilized people far exceeds these methods. There is electric torture here. Once it is applied, the whole body feels painful and about to burst, and then one faints. After a while, one wakes up and is tortured again. I have heard that some people have been tortured seven or eight times in a row. Even if they are lucky enough to escape death, their teeth will all be loose from then on, and their nerves will also become dull and unable to recover. Last year, when Edison was commemorated, many people praised the benefits of telegraphs and telephones to people, but they did not think that the same electricity can cause such great harm to some people. Lucky people use electricity to treat diseases and beautify themselves, but unfortunate people lose their lives and suffer because of it.</p>
<p>Other countries use gunpowder to make bullets to defend against enemies, but China uses it to make firecrackers to worship gods; other countries use compasses to navigate the sea, but China uses them to look at feng shui; other countries use opium to treat diseases, but China uses it as food. The difference in the way the same thing is used in China and the West is like this, and it is not just electricity.</p>

<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Tianyun Tower, the Garden of Eden on earth.</p>
<p>In the dim night, walking up to the highest floor of Tianyun Tower, what kind of world unfolds: a dark dome, low above, silent, deep, elusive, stars twinkling their eyes there; a new moon rising, a light haze, tall buildings covered with a layer of silk; in the distance and nearby, red, green, purple, and yellow streams of light interwoven into a colorful light network; the sound of cars and people on Nanjing Road, blown by the wind, rendered into harmonious music, echoing the light waves; this is a solemn and serene realm, the Garden of Eden in Genesis.</p>
<p>In the Garden of Eden, a group of naked Adams, taking off their suits, citizen clothes, intellectuals', and moralists' robes, are chasing each other there completely naked; their cheeks are red, their eyes are focused, the blood in their hearts is boiling, chasing their Eves. That group of Eves are also naked, chasing each other there completely naked; their lips are so red, their arms so smooth, their eyes so flowing, chasing their Adams.</p>
<p>Satan is waiting by the stairs; Eve ate the forbidden fruit, and Adam followed suit, so Satan laughed by the stairs!</p>

<p>— Cheng Yirong</p>
<p>I have arrived in Shanghai again.</p>
<p>Shanghai used to be my second hometown. I left so much of my life's blood here, and I also had so many beautiful dreams here. But since I left for Hangzhou, it has been two years. In these two years, the clear face of Shanghai has jumped out of my memory and become a very blurry outline. I can no longer remember the wild dancing and singing of the rich who live solely for pleasure, nor have I forgotten the miserable sighs of the poor men wandering in the streets, the coquettishness of the girls, the sweat of the coolies, the extravagance, the licentiousness, the chaos, the crowding, I have forgotten everything.</p>
<p>This time, in the heavy snow, the train carried me to Shanghai again. Jumping off the train, the tragic traces of war immediately jumped into my eyes. I said to Mr. × who was traveling with me:</p>
<p>"Look, the war scars on the wall."</p>
<p>"It's been over a year."</p>
<p>It's been over a year, these words sharply pierced my heart, and I was lost. Hastily walking out of the station and onto the street, the street was as crowded as the station, with people coming and going, coming and going. In the center of the road, waves of brand-new cars were driving, "bo" "bo" sounding, scaring away many timid pedestrians.</p>
<p>Drilling through the crowd, and then coming out of the crowd, I arrived in Shanghai again, and Shanghai and I met again.</p>
<p>The endless crowds, the endless cars. The endless array of colorful goods displayed in the windows along the road, everything is still the same, tall foreign buildings, long shop signs, charming eyes, rogue faces, music, dancing, erotic pictures, movies, robbers, pickpockets, suicide, jumping into the Huangpu River, the stench of opium, the madness of drunkards... Everything is still the same, this is Shanghai, this is also the den of sin.</p>
<p>Although everything has jumped out of memory and is completely forgotten, the sentences that have been memorized will still be fluent as before when they are seen again, even if a long time has passed. So I reviewed in my heart, the current Shanghai is no different from two years ago. Ah, what a luxury, debauchery, enjoyment, ease, mixed into such a complex society.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Fine Rain Dampens Time <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Mei Kan</p>
<p>A misty drizzle is falling in the early morning, and the wheel of time has turned to spring again.</p>
<p>However, the cold left over from the residual winter has not yet gone away, and I cannot see the tender green grass and the newly sprouting willows. Spring, in the mundane city, is still without news. Only the black female cat kept by the apartment owner, when the weather suddenly warmed up yesterday, suddenly climbed onto the roof and called out by herself. From the sound of this "cat calling for spring", I felt that spring had indeed arrived. But today it is drizzling, and even this little bit of spring has disappeared.</p>
<p>The weather is changing, and this is my most unlucky time, all the joints in my body will ache, especially at night.</p>
<p>Spring, the rainy days of early spring, are indeed the most annoying. Time has only just reached the Lantern Festival on the lunar calendar, but people's boredom is already as deep as it is in the depths of spring. Thinking of my hometown around the Lantern Festival, it should still be quite lively, even though the old calendar has long been "revolutionized".</p>
<p>In my childhood, the first month was the happiest time. From New Year's Day, I wore new clothes until the month ended and the family school started. During this month, adults were busy gambling, and children were busy setting off firecrackers and watching village operas.</p>
<p>I remember that I was not a very good child when I was young. Once, when I was only seven years old, I gambled with some adults in the neighbor's house on the Lantern Festival, and as a result, I lost the one yuan "lucky money" that my father gave me on New Year's Eve. I was very anxious, fearing that my father would scold me if he found out, and even beat me. But I didn't dare not go home. Sure enough, in the afternoon, my mother discovered that my lucky money was gone. My mother forced me to ask, and I had to lie, saying that I was leaning on the lotus dock in the courtyard in the morning to watch the fish swimming, and unknowingly it slipped from my pocket into the water. My mother believed me very much, trusting me as all loving mothers in the world trust that their own children are good children, and quickly took fire tongs to search in the lotus dock. At that time, my heart had already been condemned!</p>
<p>My father, like most fathers, was more shrewd and decisive than my mother. He had already seen through my flaws and finally put on the air of a "strict father", forcing me to confess. Naturally, the result was that I confessed the truth. My father got angry and wanted to hit me. I was about to take the opportunity to escape, but my hand was already held by my father. I cried, and fortunately my mother pleaded for me, and I was finally spared a beating.</p>
<p>Such things now only bring a sense of loss. My kind mother is still alive, but my loving father passed away eighteen years ago. I don't know where my own childlike innocence has disappeared. The years have passed like water, and the joy of childhood can no longer be regained. Time just passes silently, passes, and when I wake up, I am already twenty-seven years old. If a person enjoys a life of sixty years, it certainly cannot be considered a premature death. According to such a number, half of his life has already passed; but what has this half of life gained?</p>
<p>Alas! Time just passes silently in the endless drizzle.</p>
<h3 id="e220">The Black Girl's Prayer to God <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— By Xiao Bo'ne, translated by Yi</p>
<p>However, when she had taught the black girl to read and gave her a Bible on her birthday, she was probably rash. Why? Because when the black girl, who was very serious about accepting her teacher's answers, took her "knobkerrie" (Note) and strode into the African forest to find God, she took the Bible with her as a travel guide. (Note) A short club used by South African natives as a throwing weapon, with a round lump at one end.</p>
<p>The first thing she encountered was a "boomslang," one of the few venomous snakes that attack humans who cross their path. Originally, the teacher, because the animals were affectionate and never asked any questions, liked to keep animals. She had taught the black girl that if she could restrain herself, she should not kill anything and should not be afraid of anything. Therefore, she tightened her "knobkerrie" slightly and said to the "boomslang," "I don't know who created you! Why did he give you the will to kill me and the venom to do so?"</p>
<p>The "boomslang" immediately twisted its head, pointed for her to follow it, and led her to a pile of rocks, on which sat a noble-looking, burly white man, with a handsome and upright appearance, a solemn beard, and thick curly hair; both of which were as white as mica, and with a ruthless, serious expression. He had a staff in his hand, which seemed to be a scepter, a collective of large clubs and large "assegais" (Note): with this, he immediately killed the "boomslang" that was approaching him respectfully and reverently.</p>
<p>(Note) A type of light spear used by South African natives.</p>
<p>Having received the lesson of not being afraid of anything, the black girl felt her heart harden towards him, first because she thought strong men should be black, and only the ladies of the church should be white, second because he had killed her friend, the snake, and third because he was wearing ridiculous white pajamas, which reminded her of the one point where her teacher had failed to influence her, which was the obligation to wear a skirt, as she considered her own body shameful. When she spoke to him, there was a contempt in her voice.</p>
<p>"I am seeking God," she said. "Can you guide me?"</p>
<p>"You have seen him," he replied. "Kneel down now and worship me, you arrogant fellow. Otherwise, beware of my wrath. I am the Lord of Hosts; I created the heavens and the earth, and everything in between. I created the venom of the snake and the milk in your mother's breasts. In my hand is death and all diseases, thunder and lightning, storms and plagues, and all other evidence of my greatness and majesty. Kneel, girl; next time you come to me, bring your beloved child here and kill it as a sacrifice before me; for I love the scent of the first blood spilled."</p>
<p>"I have no children," the black girl said. "I am a virgin." (II)</p>

<p>— Zi</p>
<p>(6) Revolution and Confucius</p>
<p>I have already seen the books Confucius and Drama published. Now I will describe the book Revolution and Confucius, which is mostly recorded from official and private documents published by governments and party departments at all levels and revolutionary comrades since the "National Revolution" on the issue of Confucius (excluding personal specialized treatises on this issue). The entire book is nearly 100,000 words, with the following chapters:</p>
<p>A. On the sacrificial rites of Confucius and the commemoration of Confucius.</p>
<p>B. On the management and disposal of Confucius temples and their properties.</p>
<p>C. On the destruction and restoration of the Confucius Temple in Qufu.</p>
<p>D. On the issue of special treatment for the Confucius clan.</p>
<p>E. On the reading of Confucian classics in schools.</p>
<p>F. On various Taoist organizations.</p>
<p>G. On the "humiliating Confucius incident," that is, the "Zi Jian Nanzi incident."</p>
<p>Since the late Qing Dynasty, whether Confucianism is compatible with modern politics has become a major issue. The conservative Ye Dehui and others attacked the reformers, accusing Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao of being traitors to Confucianism, and wrote the "Yi Jiao Cong Bian." The reformer Kang Youwei also advocated the Three Protections (protecting Confucianism, protecting the race, and protecting the country) and used the birth year of Confucius for chronology. The revolutionaries (or Tongmenghui faction) represented by Mr. Zhang Taiyan advocated that Confucianism and revolution were incompatible and strongly rejected Confucianism:</p>
<p>"Our Chinese religion, Confucianism, was originally extremely good: that is, all religions have mysterious and difficult-to-understand words mixed in, but Confucianism is still considered clean. But it also has extremely bad points: because Confucius was originally in an era when nobles were in power, and ordinary people could not become officials. Confucius wanted to compete with the nobles, so he educated three thousand disciples to prepare them to become officials. From then on, ordinary people could indeed become officials. But Confucius was very timid. Although he wanted to compete with the nobles, he did not dare to unite with the common people to overthrow the noble political system. Although he had the words "non-hereditary officials" in the Spring and Autumn Annals, he only criticized them verbally and did not dare to implement them. Therefore, he always taught his disciples to follow others, at best to be the qualifications of imperial teachers and royal advisors, and never dared to covet the throne; and at the lowest level, even being a petty official was acceptable. When you look at Confucius's life, when he acted as prime minister, he only relied on the Duke of Lu. After traveling through seventy-two countries several times, he was at the end of his rope and returned home to retire. At that time, he even relied on the Ji family. Wasn't his ambition getting shorter and shorter every day? Therefore, the biggest stain on Confucianism is that it makes people unable to escape the thought of wealth and honor. Since Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty exclusively honored Confucianism, the number of people who were enthusiastic about wealth and honor has been increasing day by day. If we want to carry out the revolution and promote civil rights today, if we mix in a little bit of the heart of wealth and honor, it is like a microbe that can harm the whole body, so Confucianism is absolutely unusable." | Min Zhi No. 6, Taiyan's speech record.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Taiyan was indeed a relatively progressive revolutionary thirty years ago, and he also had foresight about the corruption of the so-called revolutionary great men who used Confucianism. Alas! I was born late, and I have not yet had the opportunity to personally receive Mr. Zhang's teachings. If my book "Revolution and Confucius" is published and Mr. Zhang has the opportunity to see it, I don't know how he would feel.</p>

<p>— Mi Er</p>
<p>The severity of the current global unemployment problem is an undeniable fact. For those of us who have neither relatives who are officials nor friends in the comprador class, it is only natural that we should starve or suffer. Even if we are lucky enough to find a place to eat, we must often endure the anger of our superiors—no, the brother-in-law or other relatives of our superiors. These relatives of our superiors are what we usually call "those who wear yellow silk jackets," or what we call the "easy to see the king, but difficult to deal with the little devils."</p>
<p>We small clerks, in addition to doing our duty, must also pay attention to whether they have any malice towards us. Some of those who are oppressed have to swallow their anger and pretend to eat in order to get by for the rest of their lives because of their difficult circumstances. If the facts allow, some are strong-willed and unwilling to submit, and as a result, they become unemployed, become hooligans, or "eat rice from their hometown." Some have lofty ideals, endure for a while, and usually bury themselves in hard work and steadily move forward.</p>
<p>Once their talents are sufficient to seek other positions on their own, they immediately find ways to escape this "cage."</p>
<p>But aren't these "little devils" filling up every place or every organization, but filling up all of China? (Because foreigners don't like to use their own relatives to handle affairs like the Chinese.) Their power is really not small. This is really a national social problem in China. At the same time, it is also a major reason why Chinese businesses are not run well.</p>
<p>Since their influence in society is so great, and the harm they do to the country is so huge, we really cannot help but give them a special class. The famous British politician Burke once said that the royal family is the first class, the gentry is the second class, the common people are the third class, and journalists are the fourth class. Then, let's call this group of "little devils" the fifth class.</p>
<p>Before ending this article, we must also state that the relatives of superiors mentioned here of course refer to a group of people who have no ability and specialize in taking advantage of their power to grab food. As for those who make a living by their own work, of course, they are exceptions.</p>

<p>— Geng</p>
<p>× Star, not only is her skill unparalleled, and her name the crown of the film world; she is also skilled in eloquence, and widely acquainted with people, and is also one of the top social butterflies in Shanghai! A noble relative of hers came from the countryside and was eager to meet her, but did not know where her mansion was. Later, with great difficulty, she found out her phone number (naturally, it could not be found in the phone book), and called her to ask, and it happened to be her who answered the phone. She first asked about the caller's intention, and then replied irrelevantly with only one sentence, "Miss has gone to Hangzhou," and hung up the phone. After a while, a busybody called again, pretending to say, "Y's mansion wants to send New Year's gifts over, but the house number is not very clear." As a result, not only was the inquiry fulfilled, but they also managed to hear a crisp and pleasant "Thank you!" for free!</p>

<p>A Chinese modern woman in Western clothes was standing on the street waiting for a car, probably using the spare time, she quickly opened the mirror case in her handbag to apply lipstick, unexpectedly dropping eight or nine copper coins. She seemed to disdain bending over, ignoring them completely. A poor woman with a white cloth wrapped around her head and a baby in her arms ran over to pick them up, but the modern woman glared fiercely at her and her child. The poor woman suppressed her excitement and stepped aside. In an instant, the modern woman got into the car and left, and all these copper coins were snatched away by a Russian with a huge hand and long hair. The poor woman with the baby in her arms could only stare in a daze!</p>

<p>Mr. Wang often boasts that he is a typical modern person who is naturally fond of flattering and never bullying those below him. Last winter, the young master of his company celebrated his 30th birthday. Because he wanted to take the auspicious meaning of "The Eight Immortals Celebrating Longevity," he almost pawned his wife's personal red cotton jacket to scrape together eight old Yuan silver dollars to send as a congratulatory gift, but he was worried that he might not win the favor of the boss's wife. His own young son was elected by his classmates as a member of the "Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army Donation Team," and he spent a lot of effort to ask his old man for two jiao (a unit of Chinese currency) as a donation, but he refused. His close friend, Xiao Chen, was furious when he heard about it and launched a crusade, saying: "Old Wang! You fellow, so you are also a decadent element who 'only adds flowers to brocade, but does not send charcoal in the snow'!" Mr. Wang sneered: "Congratulating on birthdays is a matter of face, who doesn't like to look good? Donating money?! People have to be willing, and there's no way to force it!"</p>

Fortunately, the general manager was unharmed. However, when the bank's employees heard the bad news, they were all shocked: "This is terrible!

<p>He could no longer remember his mother's appearance, and at the same time, his mother could no longer remember her son's face.</p>
<p>When mother, under God's command, abandoned all the glory of the universe and left this defiled society, he was still in his mother's arms, living on her milk.</p>
<p>"Mother! My dear mother! Your son recognizes you! Your son has failed you! Your unfilial son is about to leave you! To leave you forever! Never again will I be able to wait on you as before. Mother! Perhaps your son will meet you in the afterlife! Mother... I'm leaving!" He stared at the portrait hanging on the wall and shouted excitedly.</p>
<p>The air in this strangely passionate garret suddenly turned cold. The birds on the few sparse trees outside the window kept chirping, as if they were also shedding tears. The sunlight gradually slanted westward, from bright to dim, and from dim to black. The portrait on the wall seemed to fade away with the sunlight.</p>
<p>The mournful and激烈的 military bugle, the calls of "kill, kill, kill", the sound of guns, and the sound of cannons, conveyed and reported along with the direction of the storm. Urging people from all directions to quickly take up arms and struggle for the mountains and rivers of China, never to be intoxicated under champagne! His heart was struck by it, his blood was spurting for it, in the deep dark night, in the night where he could not find a glimmer of dawn, he followed the sound of bugles, the sound of killing, the sound of guns, and the sound of cannons, daring to rush to the front line to fight.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he was a person with ambition and struggle, he was indeed promising, and he actually found himself in the midst of gunfire, artillery fire, and misty smoke, raising the gun he had seized from the enemy, aiming at the enemy's ranks and firing, advancing and retreating according to the orders of the military adviser, defending and attacking with the crowd of warriors. However, after all, his heart was going to break, his blood was limited, his spirit was exhausted, and he had never received military knowledge, so he was finally shot by the enemy's bullets, fell into the pile of corpses, and angrily said in pain:</p>
<p>"You dog party, dare to boldly fight back against us. Good... good... good! I will kill you until you beg for mercy."</p>
<p>So he quickly climbed up again, picked up his original weapon, and continued to fire randomly. Alas! His fate was really too bad, he was shot again, his heart finally broke, and his blood was about to run out.</p>
<p>"Mom... Mom...! Your... son... is... coming... to... serve... Mom... Mom...! "</p>
<p>Our team, our military camp, our lovely China, has lost a brave soldier.</p>
<p>At this time, the war horses neighed on the battlefield, the roosters crowed in the four villages, the guard dogs barked madly, and the sky gradually brightened. But he would never be resurrected again: his soul finally escaped from this terrifying battlefield and flew into his mother's arms.</p>
<p>Ah! This is the crystallization of his blood!</p>

<p>— Human Voice</p>
<p>In recent months, because of struggling in a difficult life, I have had to rack my brains as much as possible. The neurasthenia, which had not flared up for almost half a year, has taken the opportunity to entangle me this week. I really want to curse life and hate life! The most painful thing for me is insomnia every night, and almost half of the night has to be spent tossing and turning. Each time, although I try my best to calm down, discard all thoughts, and focus on listening to the ticking of the clock, concentrating on silently reciting the "one, two, three, four..." self-hypnosis method that my father taught me when I was a child, because in this way, perhaps I can make the brain nerves tired and get sleep. Trying like this, sometimes it has miraculous effects, but sometimes it is unfortunately very effective, the more I calm down, the more complex the thoughts become, the blood seems to surge up, the eyelids are wide open, the brain is more awake, the only way is to put on my clothes and climb up, lean on the writing desk, and scribble on the manuscript paper with a pen. Ah, the whip of life! Painful!</p>
<p>Although my dormitory is located near the countryside. Here, especially at night, there is no noisy city sound, and it is rare to have the wailing of car horns. In theory. Such a quiet place is extremely suitable for me to live in. However, in this waste year, firecrackers are continuously set off almost all night long. The most exciting thing is on this night, and it is said that this is the Lantern Festival night, the annual Lantern Festival. In the evening, because I tried my best to avoid using my brain, I took a solitary stroll in the fields for an hour after dinner. After returning home, I desperately played with the newly bought dumbbells. After nine o'clock, I fell on the bed. I was really exhausted. I thought to myself that I would definitely be able to sleep peacefully tonight. However, I was awakened by a strange, loud signal flare just as I was entering a state of drowsiness. Then, large firecrackers and long strings of firecrackers went off one after another, making noise all night long. I, in such a noisy environment, still want to sleep? With my eyes wide open, I began to think that it had been a year since I came to Shanghai. The embarrassing situation of having nowhere to rely on when I first arrived in Shanghai could not help but make me shiver deeply. The sound of firecrackers outside, far and near, was like the sound of machine guns and cannons during the war last year. Thus, the tragic situation of the war was replayed on the cerebral cortex. I thought, the people of Shanghai are really in a good mood! The huge trauma they suffered has only been a year ago, the tragic state of Zhabei is still there, but their lives seem to have reached a peaceful atmosphere, and they are having a happy New Year. Where do I even begin with this?</p>
<p>My heart is beating non-stop, the blood in my brain is rushing at an accelerated rate, and the firecrackers outside are still making a loud and lively noise. On this night, can I still sleep?</p>

<p>Dang, dang...</p>
<p>The class bell rang, waking every young man and woman from their sweet dreams. The straight Western suits and the trembling fleshy legs under the qipaos were all swallowed into the big mouth of the classroom.</p>
<p>Today, the classroom is particularly lively. The front rows of seats have long been occupied by Misses, and even the last few rows of seats covered in dust are occupied by strangers. The whole classroom is packed. But they can still maintain temporary silence, except for the slight smiles on everyone's faces.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, it turned out to be the last lesson of this semester, and as usual, they were supposed to talk about the exam questions, so they and she came so enthusiastically, opening up the records of the entire semester. However, contrary to their wishes, the professor was late in coming. Seeing that the first class was about to end, there was not half a shadow of the professor. The raging fire was burning in the hearts of every young man and woman, and they and she could not bear the silence of stillness. For a while, the shadows of people in the hall were scattered, the noise was loud, and the chalk was dancing on the blackboard.</p>
<p>"Mr. ××× has asked for two hours of leave due to illness."</p>
<p>"Mr. ×× forever:::"</p>
<p>"::::::"</p>

<p>Some were drawing Misses' permed hair, charming faces, breasts, and buttocks on the blackboard, but they were casually drawing and erasing under the supervision of the opposite sex.</p>
<p>Some were pointing at the backs of the Misses in the front rows.</p>
<p>Some were burying their heads in reading romance novels.</p>
<p>Some were exchanging small pieces of paper to discuss their private affairs.</p>
<p>Some were fighting to watch movie advertisements and supplements.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Various different emotions, everyone is continuing to play, and happiness is waiting with pleasure.</p>
<p>The bell for the first class has rung, and the professor has asked for leave. In a state of disappointment and depression, that professor must be damned. After that, leather shoes closely followed high heels and fled out, and the classroom soon returned to its original emptiness.</p>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I am a newly graduated worker in a Western clothing store, 23 years old. My father died early, and I have no brothers or sisters. When we were young, my mother sent me to elementary school and arranged a marriage for me. Now, she is nearly 60 years old and sees that I have graduated. Because there is no one at home to take care of her, she wants me to get married on a regular basis. I was afraid that the old man would be sad, so I agreed. I want to borrow some money from the boss to rush this matter. I usually feel that I lack knowledge and want to go to night school for tutoring, but I have to do night work in this store, so I cannot do it. I also want to transfer to another store so that I can have free nights to complete my reading aspirations. However, in this way, the new boss will ultimately be less familiar than the old master, and it will be difficult to borrow money for marriage. For economic reasons, the two unrelated things of "marriage" and "reading" are linked and conflict.</p>
<p>Sir, please help me think of a way to reconcile them so that I can fulfill my filial piety and also fulfill my reading wishes. (The following is omitted) Sincerely, Wang Xianghe</p>
<p>× × × ×</p>
<p>Editor's note: We have always opposed "borrowing money for marriage." However, because Mr. Wang's family is declining and his mother is old, we have to exceptionally support his temporarily "borrowing money for marriage" to fulfill his filial piety. However, after marriage, Mr. Wang's burden will be heavier, and the family's expenses will naturally increase several times. At the same time, he must find a way to pay off debts. Although we despise mammonism, we cannot help but advise Mr. Wang to work hard to increase his income. At the same time, we know that the income of workers in Western clothing stores increases or decreases with the amount of work. The wages in places that also do night work are naturally better than in places that only do day work. We advise Mr. Wang not to think of other jobs, but to borrow money for marriage according to your planned steps and continue to work in this store, slowly paying off the borrowed debt. "If you want peace in the world, unless everyone has food to eat." As for the level of knowledge, it is of course also very important, but you must always let this "food" take precedence. Some people's industries fall into it, and they cannot eat without knowledge, then of course food and knowledge can be mixed together. For some people, their profession has no great relationship with knowledge at all, then knowledge is only to cultivate personality. It is something for pleasure and relaxation, and even "only for entertainment." Mr. Wang's profession, I am afraid, is this kind? So we advise you not to sacrifice a portion of your working hours and be sure to join night school. If you cannot forget about knowledge at all, then read beneficial books and newspapers in your spare time, and you can also increase your knowledge.</p>

<p>— Wang Zhongxian</p>
<p>Ruo Hua, after being poured with his love potion, didn't complain about him. She went to sound out her daughter on her feelings for You Zhong. Daiqiu said resentfully:</p>
<p>"I hate him! I hate even seeing his shadow! I don't want to call him uncle, because he is my enemy. I want to scold him and want to hit him a few times, but because of my mother's face, I have to forgive him!"</p>
<p>Seeing that her daughter hated You Zhong so much, Ruo Hua was afraid that she would really cause trouble, so it was better to send her away in marriage as soon as possible. She discussed it with You Zhong:</p>
<p>"Daiqiu is already eighteen years old. Sooner or later, she will be someone else's family. It is better to betroth her as soon as possible. My nephew Zheng Jiping has proposed marriage again and again. I think this young man is not bad, so let's agree to him."</p>
<p>You Zhong pondered for a while and said, "The daughter is yours. You can marry her to whomever you want. I cannot advise. However, you need to ask Miss clearly whether she is willing in her heart so that she will not complain in the future."</p>
<p>Ruo Hua went to ask Daiqiu. Daiqiu lowered her pink neck and said nothing. This is the normal state of girls, and not opening her mouth is an implicit hint of consent.</p>
<p>XI. I am willing to marry anyone.</p>
<p>Ruo Hua got her daughter's implied consent and went to agree to Jiping. Jiping had been thinking about Daiqiu for a long time. Hearing that the marriage was successful, he was so happy that he danced with joy. He immediately changed his address to call Ruo Hua mother-in-law. Seeing that Jiping was both talented and handsome, and that it was a marriage between relatives, Ruo Hua had chosen a good son-in-law and was happy in her heart. She told him to quickly find a matchmaker to carry out the engagement procedures.</p>
<p>Jiping went home and told his parents. The two elders knew that Daiqiu was the only daughter of Xia Zhongnan. Marrying her would allow them to inherit a share of the family fortune, so they quickly found a professional matchmaker to propose marriage. The matchmaker ran around two or three times and settled the betrothal gifts, etc. When Jiping was very happy, he suddenly received an anonymous letter. The letter read:</p>
<p>Mr. Jiping:</p>
<p>Xia Daiqiu is my lover. Suddenly, you have taken her away. How can I be willing? While you are not yet engaged, I advise you to stop the process quickly and put an end to your delusions. If you persist in your delusion, you will regret it in the future! Advanced warning, I hope you will turn back soon! Sincerely, Aiqiu</p>
<p>Jiping often went in and out of the Xia family and knew that Daiqiu did not leave her home. How could she have contact with men? This letter must have been written by someone deliberately joking. He didn't show it to anyone, and the marriage continued as usual. Who knew that after two or three days, another letter came, the tone of which was much more intense than the previous letter. He had no choice but to take it to his parents to discuss. His parents also said that someone was jealous and threatening, and ignored it. After three days, the date for the engagement had been set. Jiping received another letter. There was a hard bullet attached to the letter, saying that if he did not stop the marriage, he would use the final means to deal with him. Jiping's parents panicked and decided not to marry the Xia family's daughter. Since they didn't want her, they couldn't ruin Miss's reputation, so they could only politely say to the matchmaker that they intended to return the engagement because Miss's birthdates did not match. But Jiping's heart opposed the cancellation of the engagement. He still proclaimed to the outside world that he was willing to marry Daiqiu as his wife and was not afraid of any threats.</p>
<p>The matchmaker was very unhappy because the matter failed and she didn't get any benefits. She went to the Xia family and said a few bad words. Ruo Hua was naturally angry when she heard this, but You Zhong said coldly:</p>
<p>"This cannot be blamed on the Zheng family. It is to blame on Miss's birthdate being bad. Miss has a hard fate. If there are parents-in-law, she will kill her parents-in-law. If there are no parents-in-law, she will kill her husband. I knew long ago that it would not be easy to arrange a marriage. It has indeed happened now!"</p>
<p>Ruo Hua was also worried about her daughter, but she blamed You Zhong for not saying that her daughter had a hard fate in front of the matchmaker, because they were people who went to thousands of families. If this news spread, who would dare to marry my daughter? After the matchmaker left, Ruo Hua blamed You Zhong. You Zhong refused to admit his mistake, and the two had a quarrel. After one night, they were reconciled as before. You Zhong had an important matter to go to Beijing and would leave tomorrow.</p>

<h3 id="e232">Horror Films of 1933 <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Moyun</p>
<p>Since films such as "The Old House Mystery" were welcomed by audiences, the American film industry, in order to cater to this social psychology, will strive to produce horror films from the beginning of 1933. As far as we know now, there are four types: The first is about a forbidden ape wreaking havoc in New York City. This is a work by RKO Pictures, originally titled (King Koug). The story tells of a film company capturing a giant ape on a deserted island and transporting it back to New York. The ape took advantage of people's lack of preparation, escaped the ban, kidnapped a girl, and hid in the highest 102-story building in New York. Later, it was discovered, but because there was no way to capture it, they sent a squadron of air force to bomb it to death from the air.</p>
<p>The second is a work by First National Pictures. It depicts the owner of a wax museum who, wanting to make the wax figures he made look like real people, steals corpses from mortuaries and cemeteries every night and smears them with a layer of wax, which is naturally very vivid and looks exactly like a living person. Later, he met a girl whose face was very similar to that of an ancient queen. He wanted to murder her and remake her into a wax figure... How the girl's life and death will turn out, let us wait for the film to be released and see the result.</p>
<p>The third is the story of 'The Mummy Who Crawled Out of the Tomb'. The story tells that in ancient Egypt, there was a high priest who broke the precept and fell in love with a virgin. Later, the virgin died, and he stole a book of heaven. Reciting the incantations in that book of heaven can bring the dead back to life; however, because his theft was discovered, he was buried alive, and the book of heaven was buried with him. Thousands of years later, a young explorer excavated the high priest's tomb and took out the book of heaven. Because he did not know the reason, he recited the incantations in his mouth. Suddenly, the high priest's mummy came back to life and snatched the book of heaven away. After the mummy was resurrected, he knew that the soul of his lover had been reincarnated as a human being. He also tried to kill the girl to make her soul return to her body and resurrect.</p>
<p>The fourth is about a crazy doctor who makes humans out of animal specimens. This is a work by Paramount Pictures. The story is taken from H.G. Wells' "The Island of Dr. Moreau." It</p>
<p>depicts that doctor used surgical operations making human beings. This is a terrifying masterpiece with scientific meaning.</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3 id="e233">(I) A Critique of the Symphony of Life <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>In a story that isn't particularly unique, there's often the possibility to stage an extraordinary drama full of the meaning of life, and this film is a good example of that.</p>
<p>It tells the story of a doctor from a family of modest means who, through his hard work and the fervent expectations of his parents and siblings, becomes a famous physician. Of course, being a famous doctor, he inevitably carries a heavy burden for his family, and so he must diligently serve the wealthy in order to satisfy the somewhat more refined living needs of his parents and siblings. Although he possesses a benevolent nature and shows special care for the poor and sick, his old father eventually falls seriously ill. Despite his best efforts to save him, the father ultimately passes away. From then on, he can no longer trust his own abilities and decisively abandons his profession. However, he is eventually encouraged by his lover to regain his strength and fulfill his due responsibility to society.</p>
<p>In such a story, what we can understand is that life often presents many opportunities that make us lose confidence in ourselves, causing us to become passive. We watch people suffer while also feeling deeply uncomfortable ourselves. This kind of contradiction often exists in the course of our lives. However, we need to have faith in ourselves, because this faith can truly enhance the joy of our lives. At the same time, we can also realize here the mockery that modern society gives to life. In order to eat, we have to bow our heads to people we despise. Of course, this is a bitterness we often encounter. In fact, perhaps this is life!</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the theme of this play is not bad, and it is used quite profoundly by the director, so that we still have a deep stimulation after walking out of the theater. This stimulation can make us reminisce about the sorrows of life. At the same time, we can find many things that benefited from the director's skills here. Although some camera positions are inevitably ordinary, their exquisite details cannot be erased.</p>
<p>Secondly, what we should pay attention to is the performance skills of the protagonist Ricardo Cortez. Although the first half is just average, the second half fully reveals his brilliance. Especially the feeling of distress caused by contradictions is very vivid. The heroine Jrenne Dunne is just average, not particularly remarkable. However, Gregory Rotoff, who plays the father, is just right, so we know that every good supporting role often adds a lot of color to the play.</p>
<p>The lighting and sound are very good, but the dialogue is a bit too much. The setting is very suitable for the plot, but because the camera cannot be better handled, the setting appears plain.</p>
<p>This is a very watchable film, especially in terms of meaning, it will give us a conceptual understanding of life.</p>
<h3 id="e234">(II) A Critique of Rebound <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Nan</p>
<p>Let me say at the beginning that "Rebound" is a superior film. At the very least, it offers a very frank and insightful portrayal of life and ideal love. Originally, young people often find themselves on the wrong path in love due to their environment and cannot find a way out. This film does not use ridicule to teach people; it merely uses a light touch and humor to indicate the proper course of love. Indeed, this is a bit of understanding and guidance that those immersed in the river of love need.</p>
<p>The plot is not amazing. It tells the story of five simple unrequited loves. A (male) loves B (female), but B loves C (male), C is partial to D (female), and D marries E (male). So C, because of unrequited love, marries B. On their honeymoon trip, they run into D in Paris from the New World. C plans to rekindle their old feelings. Unexpectedly, A provokes them from within, planning to take B for himself. B also sees C's abnormality, so she plans to divorce. Later, C repents of his mistakes and reconciles with B.</p>
<p>This cannot be considered a perfect comedy. I think the reunion of B and C is not a happy thing. The union of B and C in the first place was not a happy marriage at all. Since it has split again, the script insists on fulfilling them, which is inevitably far-fetched.</p>
<p>However, this doesn't matter, we can still deeply understand the meaninglessness of non-love unions. "Things must rot before insects breed," if a third party joins a love affair, there must first be a considerable background. One more point is that an excellent lover is not necessarily a good housewife. The reason why C abandons D for B in this film is because he recognized this point.</p>
<p>The director's skill lies in interweaving and contrast. Generally speaking, it is very plain. The photography can be said to be good. The light is very bright and still beautiful.</p>
<p>What is very special is that the clarity and loudness of the sound in this film are unmatched by any other film. Moreover, we can find many interesting things in the dialogue and small movements. Unfortunately, there is a little too much dialogue.</p>
<p>Among the actors, the girl (B) Ina Claire is the best. She works hard from beginning to end. Her inner facial performance is rare. The other so-called stars are just average and competent.</p>
<p>Anna May Wong has recently returned to the United States from England and is still working in Hollywood. This is her recent photo.</p>

<p>The recently released "Theme Song of Paradise" at Guanglu is a musical and tragic British sound film. After spending two hours watching this film, it made us shed a few hot tears and have a sense of resonance before we left.</p>
<p>The plot is very long to tell, so I will still say the general idea: there are two British brothers who cross the ocean to Rome to specialize in music. They are both in love with the same girl, but they are engaged in open and secret struggles. Suddenly, an Italian prince jumps out of nowhere and also loves the girl, resulting in a tragic shooting. One of the brothers enters a monastery to repent, "Heaven and earth will eventually end, but this regret will last forever."</p>
<p>Of course, the plot is so mournful and lingering, like weeping and complaining. The director's skill is also very clever. In terms of actors, the expressions of John Stuart and Hughes Williams are commendable. Because the heroine Joan Muet is new to the screen (?), her performance is average, but she has fulfilled the responsibilities of the characters in the play.</p>
<p>Because this film is a musical film, the director hired a group of dancers to participate. The music is melodious and melodious, pleasant to the ear, and the background is also magnificent and gorgeous.</p>

<p>—</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the sound movie machines used in the Chinese film industry all come from Europe and the United States; but since Yan Heming and Zhu Qingxian, and Shi Shipan successively invented domestic sound machines, although they are not enough to resist foreign products, many companies have already adopted them; however, this sound movie machine is purely derived from imported goods, and most of the raw materials used are still foreign goods.</p>
<p>Now I hear that Mr. Chen Zongtong has invented a purely domestic sound movie machine. Mr. Chen is from Xiangshan, Guangdong and is currently an engineer at the American Radio Corporation. He witnessed that the sound movie machines used in the Chinese film industry were all dependent on imports; in order to remedy this, he specially gathered film industry celebrities in Hong Kong to establish the Yierguang Company, set up scientific research equipment, and engaged in the research and invention of sound movie machines.</p>
<p>Recently, he has successfully developed a purely domestic sound machine, named "Meilefeng." The test results are very satisfactory, and it can play sound on discs or films; and the cost is low, only about 5,000 yuan per unit, which is a world apart from foreign products. Now he continues to work to increase production for film merchants to use. I hope it can come to Shanghai in the near future.</p>

<p>— Yu Qing</p>
<p>"Oh, don't you recognize me? I am Clark Gable." (A Hollywood superstar)</p>
<p>The ugly woman interjected, "Oh, Mr. Gable, I am very glad to meet you. I... I am Greta Garbo, this is my friend Gloria Swanson. Who is your friend?"</p>
<p>"Oh, he is Jack Cooper."</p>
<p>The shy man said "Nice to meet you" to the beautiful girl. The girl also replied "Hello". Just as they were striking up a conversation, the man in the cap pushed away the uglier woman, grabbed the beautiful girl's arm, and walked forward, saying, "I'll lead the way, you follow."</p>
<p>Walking and walking, the frivolous young man in the cap and the beautiful girl were in the front, and the shy young man and the relatively ugly woman were in the back. The relatively ugly woman often smiled at the man next to her, feeling that his appearance was indeed not bad. But the man dared not look at her directly, and often looked elsewhere. And the beautiful girl was grabbed by the annoying frivolous young man. She was very unwilling, and often turned her head to look at the shy young man.</p>
<p>It was probably midnight, and the two girls came back. They lived in an upstairs apartment on the corner of Ninth Avenue and 42nd Street. The two young men also followed them back. The two girls are now in the bathroom. The older girl's clothes were covered in mud, and she said with a mournful face, "I have never had a happy life. Just when I was about to be happy, I fell into the gutter."</p>
<p>"Hey, Millie, what's this? It will be fine in a while, go wash it off quickly. But, I never like this kind of thing, it's too immoral. Who asked them to follow us back? Especially that Mark is a bit low-class. They won't think we are Pick_Ups (playing cards), right?"</p>
<p>"But I really like James," Millie begged pitifully. "He also likes me. Didn't you see him jump down to save me when I fell into the gutter? Oh, Pansy, please don't say no. You're doing it for me. Didn't Mona say yesterday that you only need to take a walk on Broadway to find a man? Now we've found men, but you don't want to do it. Alas, think about it for me, it's not easy for me. We work during the day and sleep alone in the cold at night. Are we going to live like this for the rest of our lives?"</p>
<p>The handle on the bathroom door shook, and a woman outside shouted, "Who's in the bathroom in the middle of the night?"</p>
<p>"It's me, Mona, I fell in the gutter and I'm taking a shower now?"</p>
<p>"Haha, it's you. If someone asks me who is willing to fall in the gutter, I would say Millie. It's you, you better hurry up." After speaking, she left.</p>
<p>They came out of the bathroom a while later and went to Millie's room. Inside, there was an oil stove with two wicks lit, and next to it was a cabinet with many cracked cups and dishes. Mark was lying on her bed smoking a cigarette. James was sitting at the door playing with a dog. Millie ran to James, "Thank you, you saved my life. I will never forget you, whatever you want me to do, I am willing." Millie grabbed James' hand and kissed it. James shrank his hand embarrassedly.</p>
<p>Mark said he was hungry and asked for something to eat. Millie and Pansy looked at each other. Millie said, "I'm very sorry, there are only some raisins at home."</p>
