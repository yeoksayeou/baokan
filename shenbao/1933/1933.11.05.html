<p>自塘沽恊定成立後。危機雖已漸趨緩和。然前途荆棘仍多。善後工作。殊非易易。其四省熱血青年之因愛國而流離失所。猶其小焉者也。自四百三十萬方里之土地淪爲異域後。關稅心入。即每年減少二千萬元。人民由東北間無形輸入於魯冀諸省者。亦已斷絶。又如濼東各縣。在農業上並非十分膏腴工業亦未充分發達。其所以比較富庶。冠河北各縣者。即恃東北三省無形中之輸入耳。頃者形勢大變。非特此種無形輸入。點滴俱無。且關外難民。大批擁入。加以敵僞匪軍之蹂躪或離間挑撥。藉故生非於是乎糾葛叢生。辦理棘手矣。</p>
<p>夫濼東各縣。在中日糾紛未能解决之際。本爲含有重大危險性之地域在一般政治關係。李際春部甫改編就緒。紛爭告一段落。而老耗子股又起。表面上似爲癬疥之疾。無關大體惟一細考其實際。則内容複雜。且藴藏未來之危機設無澈底解决方策。恐不免遺患於將來。也蓋老耗子等本爲東北義勇軍之一部。揭竿抗日。後因義軍西退。或就地隱伏。整個策略旣已變更。遂不免有人發生離貳爲敵人乘機利用甚有濟以械彈。助以資財者。此種情况。甚爲可危。况津東各地。屢經兵燹。人民尙處於水深火熱之中。而河北境内之日軍。尙多滯留未退。一般社會心理。尙多未安。至劉桂棠湯玉麟諸部。則仍駐獨石口内。赤城一帶。若無具體安挿方法。或處置偶不得當。則易挑動潛伏之危機。地方又將受其蹂躪矣。</p>
<p>更有言者。黄河流域諸省區。在我國開化雖早。然迄今仍滯留於農業經濟中。商業發達之樞紐。一在對蒙古貿易。一在對東北三省經商。山西商業如此。平津商家亦然。惟自外蒙脫離。東北淪陷。經商之前路。遂苦阻塞。而世界經濟恐慌襲來軍國主義從中侵逼。僅以轉輸爲業之商業資本。已不能不忍痛犧牲矣。夫農業經營之在我國。本已盡手工上最大之能力。以從事於耕作。無如數千年來。地力已吸取殆盡今後如不加以人工之施肥。恐難冉有增加出産之希望。吾人試細察冀魯晋豫各省。現在耕種之熟土。百分之九十以上。皆已呈現枯燥之狀。土地所含燐質及其他活力。日漸缺乏。無待分析化騐。即可知其枯竭。再觀黄河流域之居民。大多數均顯現饑色。眞能温飽略有餘力者。百不過一二。農耕旣不能補目前之急需。地力更日趨於枯竭。如不再圖設法救濟。而欲冀其以自已之力量圖更生。竊恐其無日矣。</p>
<p>故爲今之計。不能僅圖上層政治一時之相安。而當在消極方面。先解决政治上之一切矛盾。令現有軍隊。盡成爲國家軍隊。不阻碍生産事業之向上發展。如能化兵爲工。移殖邊境。則由純消費而轉入生産。此在政治方面。可爲十年之利。經濟上亦可稍事開發。再進一步以圖大規模之農業集約經營。則冀魯諸省。庶可得一借助矣。在積極方面。須注意於棉毛工業之發展。在我國原料旣多。消費市場亦廣。祗須能參用科　方法。施人工肥料。以培養土質。則不難逐漸繁榮北部各省之農業。人民得安其所業。經濟亦得向上發展。擾攘之局。根抵旣安。則對外自能發生抵抗之力量矣。</p>
<h3>李維諾夫破浪西進美俄談判週二開始　側重政治甚於經濟　兩國海軍凖備提携</h3>

<h3>美艦隊明年回大西洋日本如服清凉劑</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）　羅斯福總統已核准美國艦隊於一九三四年内撤回大西洋、據海軍次長今已聲稱、艦隊由太平洋駛出之問題、刻在認眞考慮中、美海軍之所以須游弋大西洋者、不過欲使艦隊熟知兩大洋之情形耳云、（三日路透電）</p>

<p>（東京）　美艦隊撤回大西洋之消息、此間政界頗爲歡迎、視爲一切復原之徵象、今日據外務省發言人聲稱、美艦隊之集中太平洋、兩年於茲此舉造成反常之事態、並鼓起日本激昻之輿情、此項消息、官塲方面雖尙未接到、但渠意已引起日本良好之印象云、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）　美海軍决定撤回其艦隊至大西洋之消息傳出後、日外務省當局四日非公式發表談話曰、外務省尙未接此公電、美國艦隊集中太平洋之用意、爲備滬變發生後遠東形勢之變遽、然其結果、極度剌戟日本輿論、展開日美關係一觸即發之緊張空氣，今後美國全艦隊撤至大西洋、不論其理由爲何、確表示美國對日感情緩和之一具體事件、美艦隊移駐大西洋之目的、在於頡頏歐洲大陸諸國說、似非事實、海軍省當局又談、謂據聞美艦隊明春撤回大西洋、入秋再回駐太平洋、然海軍省未接公報、美海軍之配備、應由美國自已决定、其一時的行動、不能隨便加以批評、（四日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）　美國海軍當局聲明、全海軍定明夏回駐原防、日方觀察如下、（一）美國海軍回駐原防之理由、在於遠東形勢稍和緩、無須久駐太平洋、（二）太平洋沿海之海軍根據、設備未完成、（三）日本五相會議結果、主義派未得完全勝利、國内和平思想漸增長其勢力、美國此種聲明、予日本國内以重大之影響、（四日華聯電）</p>

<h3>日本毒禍東北問題國聯會議情勢一變　英代表遷就現狀提修正案　經衆通過日代表熱切贊同</h3>

<p>（日内瓦）　自國聯鴉片顧問委員會開會後、今日國聯中人、已紛紛討論滿洲之廣種罌粟、是否將有迫政列强對於僞組織予以事實上承認之可能性、因日本旣不簽國際統制毒物之公約、而「滿洲國」又不受任何國際協定之約束、各委員皆認欲搜集滿洲一隅之鴉片統計、非常困難、因此委員會曾建議請國聯行政院設法獲致滿洲鴉片産銷數量之完全報告、該委員會雖表示其唯一宗旨僅在減少鴉片貿易、絶未以國際政治局勢置在心中、但國聯代表立見此種建議有趨向　事實承認之可能、因捨此别無獲得必要統計辦法、且目前形勢滿洲旣創行鴉片專賣又廣事種植、定將流毒無窮、故委員會在其建議中、曾稱此種不受統制與不報告之鴉片收穫、勢將易成爲世界之威脅云、（三日國民電）</p>

<h3>日本在僞國經營鐵道槪况　鐵道總局全權管理滿洲鐵道　滿洲現有鐵道約計六千公里　十年内擬再建設約四千公里</h3>
<p>據日文報載稱自本年三月一日起、滿洲鐵道由僞當局委由滿鐵會社經營後、滿鐵當局即開始傾注其多年之經騐、經營各鐵道之整備連絡及恊調工作、以期運輸統制之圓滿施行、自實行委任經營後、滿鐵會社即在瀋陽開設鐵道總局、以管理一切行政、目下正在著著進行、旣設鐵道之改善及新綫之敷設、以期滿洲鐵道網之完成、僞滿所委託滿鐵經營之鐵道爲吉長·吉敦·吉會·四洮·洮昻·洮索·齊克·呼海·（包括松花江水運事業之一部）瀋海·奉山·（包括打通綫及附屬港灣）等旣成鐵道、其借欵總額爲一萬三千萬元、其他如敦化圖們江間之綫、亦已完成、長春圖們江間之綫亦已開通、即所謂京圖線者是、又滿鐵指定北鮮之羅津爲北滿物資之呑吐港採取進津青津雄基三港併用主義使與委任經營綫之京國綫聯絡</p>
<h3>日本對滿鐵道政策</h3>
<p>日本對於滿洲交通問題、所抱方針有二、（一）主要鐵道取國營主義、以經濟開發爲主眼、爲達國防與治安維持之目的起見、將來鐵路綫之總延長以二萬五千公里爲目標、預期於今後十年間新設四千公里、合併旣存鐵道爲一萬公里、（按旣存之鐵道線、計鐵路總局綫三千一百餘公里、滿鐵會社綫一千一百餘公里、中東鐵路一千七百餘公里、合計約六千公里）（二）爲經濟的聯絡生産地與海港起見、在國内港灣之外、並利用隣國之港灣、（按此處國内係指僞滿、隣國則指日本）海軍政策以近海航路爲先、外洋航路爲後、在營口安東兩港從事修改、並凖備戎蘆島築港計畫、改善往來之滿鐵中心主義、</p>
<h3>僞滿現有鐵路長度</h3>
<p>據鐵路總局長宇佐美寬爾氏談、目下滿洲境内鐵道之密度、以滿洲面積一百二十萬平方公里、滿洲現有鐵道總長六千公里計算、約每一百平方公里有○·五公里、而在日本則爲每一百平方公里内有鐵道五·四公里、即以日本朝鮮一併而論、亦有一·五公里之數、其密度較滿洲者勝過三倍、故滿洲實有築造新線之必要、目下除敦圖線拉賓線外、如由北寗入熱河之線、連絡呼海齊克之海克線、均已開始臨時營業、其他正在建設中者計約達七百五十公里、熱河線不久可抵達承德赤峯、又海克線預定可向北展延、以抵勃拉廓威斯欽斯克對岸大里河、此種鐵道計畫如能順利進行、預算不出十年、滿洲鐵道可以倍加、</p>
<h3>水運業及汽車運輸</h3>
<p>又鐵道總局除鐵道之外、並經營水運及汽車事業、即　花江鴨綠江遼河等洲水運業、由鐵道總局管理、滿洲之船舶本年度起已由松花江進入至黑龍江之本流而抵大黑河、今後之益趨發展自可預料、復次、在新形式經營下之汽車業、實有與鐵道事業不能分離之勢、蓋分離結果、足使兩蒙損失、此在歐美及日本前鑒極多、滿鐵當局有鑒於此、除與鐵道全年關係者以外、一切汽車經營亦收歸滿鐵全權經營、本年三月二十日於北寗朝陽間通行之氣車路線、實爲其嚆矢、目下已直達承德、輸客貨不久赤峯線營業亦可開始、此不過爲其一例、將來僞滿所謂國道五萬公里計畫着着進展、各地汽車通行、與鐵道密切連絡後、其交通之完備、當更非今日所可比擬、</p>
<h3>鐵路沿線設鐵道村</h3>
<p>總局從業者約有四萬人、大部分爲滿洲人、當局爲謀從業者與鐵道沿線住民之融洽接近起見、於鐵道沿線設置鐵道村、在村内衣布優良之轂物種子、飼養豚羊等牲畜、改良其品種用種種手段保持民路間之合作、常使民方得沐浴於鐵道當局之惠澤之中、而油然生出其愛護鐵道之心云云、（世界新聞社）</p>

<h3>趙慰先訴魏廷榮父子敎唆誣告妨害自由　　　第二特院昨日開審旁聽者極衆　因捕房律師參加法官認爲不合　—結果未能進行將改期審理—</h3>
<p>前法租界中華義勇隊總司令中法銀公司經理元泰洋貨號主魏廷榮、係已故滬上巨紳朱葆三之長婿、於民國十八年七月二十四日午刻十一點餘時、由中法銀公司挈領兩子、乘自備汽車回家、經過朱葆三路大安棧門前、突被綁票匪擄架藏匿、勒索巨欵放贖、約在杭州接洽贖價、經家屬報告法捕房、由中西探營救脫險後、即拘獲匪黨朱竟成·唐世良·陳仲衡·三名、解送前法會審公廨審訊判决朱·唐·陳三犯、各禁押西牢五年、期滿再送内地官廳訊辦、至二十年秋間、又經法捕房續獲匪黨於綁架時望風之南匯人李維才·與在杭州接洽贖票之紹興人吕若望·兩名到案、後牽涉</p>
<h3>魏之連襟</h3>
<p>財政部稅普獨立團第六營中校營長河南鄭州人趙慰先與案有關係、斯時趙之隊部駐紮蚌埠家眷老母妻（妻係朱葆三之第九女九小姐、於趙在中華義勇隊任敎練時訂婚、）弟寓居蘇州、訪悉趙適於此時請假回蘇省親、乃由魏子元生、恊同捕房探員赴蘇城將趙逮捕來滬、與李·吕·一併移送第二特區法院、提起公訴、迭奉開庭審理終結、認李·吕兩人確與案中有關、判决李處徒刑二十年、吕處無期徒刑、又以趙慰先係</p>
<h3>現役軍官</h3>
<p>普通法院、不能受理、判將趙移送軍事機關審判、後李·吕·兩犯、於確定後送第二特區監獄執行、而警務處對趙慰先部份表示不服、江蘇高等法院第三分院提起上訴、經審理結果、判决駁回上訴、警務處仍不折服、又向最高法院提起上訴、至本年四月、又經捕房查得魏廷榮被綁時、與匪黨開駛汽車之汽車夫本地人錢禮和、匿在南市中華路、即會同公安局將錢拘解第二特院起訴、經開庭提審、并向監獄提出已决犯朱竟成·唐世良·陳仲衡·李維才·四人質對、（吕若望因移轉皖監執行、故未提到、）據李·朱·兩人在庭供稱、魏廷榮曾數次到捕房廣慈醫院監獄中來、請我們吃雪茄烟·嗬囒水·糖菓·</p>
<h3>敎唆咬攀</h3>
<p>趙慰先與基　人案中均有關係等　、嗣錢禮和迭經研訊、并　犯罪證據、判决宣告無罪、而趙慰先之警務處上訴、亦於斯時經過最高法院三審終結、判决駁回上訴、仍送軍事機關核辦、遂由高三分院執行庭將趙移送淞滬警備司令部、經軍法處偵查結果認定趙慰先無犯罪行爲、宣告無罪釋放、恢復自由、後趙以無辜遭受寃獄、覊押達二十個月之久、名譽精神、感受毁損痛苦、皆爲魏之敎唆誣陷所致、心不甘服、具狀司令部、對魏控告、迭奉傳訊、魏不但避不到案、竟將司令部之傳達兵拘押、經司令部交涉放出、軍法處以魏非但抗不到案、反敢拘押傳達兵、殊屬不法、即呈報前任戴司令、</p>
<h3>出票通緝</h3>
<p>魏廷榮到案訊辦在案、現在趙慰先又具狀第二特區地方法院、提起刑事自訴、控告魏廷榮·魏元生·父子敎唆誣告妨害自由等罪、請求依法訊辦等情、法院據狀、傳達兩造、原定上月十二日下午審理、因自訴人方面搜集證據未齊、狀請展期各情、已迭誌前報、昨日午後二時、此案在第二特院刑二庭審理之期、亦爲第一次之審理、自訴人趙慰先身穿軍服、頭戴軍帽（黄呢製）足登黑皮靴、偕其代理人章士釗·秦聯奎·陳羣·陳鶴汀·周孝伯·五律師準時到院候訊、被告魏廷榮、亦偕辯護人陳籙·俞鍾駱·彭棨·三律師到院報到、雙方之親友及新聞記者之注意此案而到院旁聽者甚多、法庭上</p>
<h3>人頭攅動</h3>
<p>幾有人滿之患、推事李昌年、偕書記官王葆薰升座後、傳呼雙方當事人曁其代理律師等入庭、準備開始審理、時捕房律師姚肇第亦已入庭、因是李推事先詢捕房律師今日何以到庭、姚律師即起立聲稱、本律師根據恊定第第二條後段之規定、租界行政當局可參加訴訟、今依據該條到庭參加、推事謂本院成立二年以來、審理自訴案件甚多、從無捕房律師到庭參加、今日本推事未便開此先例、至恊定第十二條之所謂參加者、爲民事訴訟、若刑事自訴案、則刑事訴訟法第三百四十六條規定、</p>
<h3>公訴程序</h3>
<p>應由檢察官陳述、或辯論之事項、于自訴程序、由自訴人行之、無參加之規定、惟捕房律師旣據恊定十二條主張參加、本推事擬即依照恊定呈請上級解釋、本案今日不能進行審理、聽候改期再行傳審云云、李推事言畢、據自訴人趙慰先之代理人秦聯奎律師起稱、指揮訴訟、固庭上職權、但本律師意見、以爲一面請求解釋、今日仍可依通常程序適用刑事訴訟法進行審理、現在當事人旣已到庭、請即點呼云云、又據被告魏廷榮之辯護人俞鍾駱律師起稱、對于秦律師之主張、本律師亦以爲然、因恊定第十二條參加、是民事訴訟、今日似可</p>
<h3>進行審理</h3>
<p>李推事又謂本案、係自訴案件、今有捕房參加、未便進行審理、并又詢問捕房律師意見姚律師起立說明參加意旨、謂租界内自訴案件、每不依刑事訴訟法第三百三十七條規定、兩年來捕房所以不參加者、因不知其案件情節、今知有本案、是以依據恊定第十二條到庭參加云云、秦律師復又起稱本律師之請進行訴訟、依通常程序、適用刑事訴訟法、非謂可於</p>
<h3>特别組織</h3>
<p>之下爲審理也、至姚律師所主張、自訴應依刑事訴訟法第三百三十七條爲限、則不獨特區法院之先例原以三百三十七條所定直接侵害個人法益爲限、且恊定第四條、于公訴案件、許由租界行政當局或被害人起訴執行公訴之檢察官僅有蒞庭陳述之權、是許可直接自訴、乃由協定而發生若以協定爲主張、則第四條宜先注意、請以姚律師所援刑事訴訟法第三百三十七條與本律師所援協定第四條同供參考、并稱自訴人趙慰先服官軍職、其駐地非在上海本埠、如庭上改期審理、請求早予傳喚云云、李推事允之、遂宣告退庭、旁聽二人、如潮水擁出、而轟動　上之三方爭執之自訴案、各有理由、不知將來如何解决也、</p>

<h3>臨别作驚人表演菲華僑籃球隊克東華　開首東華鋒芒極盛往後漸見不支　菲僑後勁甚足以五二比三八獲勝</h3>
<p>菲華僑籃球隊自全運歸來在滬比賽、勝負參半、昨晚最後與東華（卽滬江）一戰、事前預料、以爲東華可操必勝之劵上場形勢、東華果然極盛、使菲僑一籌莫展、但下半時中、菲隊奇峯突起、勢如破竹、反使東華相顧失色、罔知所措、結果菲華僑以五十二比三十八勝、裁判周家騏、</p>
<h3>定期赴厦</h3>
<p>該隊在滬戰程、已告結束、初擬另約西人球隊再作數場比賽、因不易邀約、乃作罷論、該隊球員多福建産、厦門體育界特邀請赴厦比賽、前鋒健將楊淑芳早經赴厦、故滬上比賽、均未出場、而該隊全體、亦定九日離滬赴厦、</p>
<h3>一篇總賬</h3>
<p>菲華僑隊返國參加全運會、初戰勝江蘇、再戰敗於南京、在滬四戰、三勝一負、而昨晚擊敗東華之役、可稱得意傑作、亦臨别最光榮之紀念、總計六場比賽、該隊勝分二百三十九、失分一百九十九、前鋒健將楊淑芳、自全運返滬、卽隨福建選手南返、未能在滬作戰、否則、成績當更有可觀、各塲成績如下、</p>
<p>（一）勝江蘇隊　　　四七比二三　全運會</p>
<p>（二）敗於南京隊　　十九比三七　全運會</p>
<p>（三）勝大夏大學　　五一比二四　友誼賽</p>

<p>（五）勝强華隊　　　四五比四三　友誼賽</p>
<p>（六）勝東華隊　　　五二比三八　友誼賽</p>
<h3>廣華鋒芒</h3>
<p>昨戰開始、東華鋒芒極盛、浩浩蕩蕩、如入無人之境、後方戒備嚴密、前鋒投籃準確、全隊工作、極有程序、錢敬鏞目光描準、手法活靈、有投必中、吴國霖馮念華各有建樹、左右逢源、無不得心應手、菲僑在重大威脅之下、幾全失其反抗能力、陣容紊亂、疲於奔命、比數先爲十一比零、後成二十二比四、東華遙居上屬、菲僑精神暗淡、是乎必敗無疑矣、</p>
<h3>異軍突起</h3>
<p>菲僑遭此大挫、大覺爲之吃驚不少、要求暫息、重整軍容、從此之後、菲僑忽然異軍突起、猛力反攻、一洗軟弱紊亂之態、變爲進退有序、虎虎有生氣之勁軍、張良雄屢有投中、林敖溜不甘屈伏、從此軍容大盛、銳不可　、分數如青雲　上、逐漸接近、東華至此、彷彿如起初之菲僑、顧此失彼、忙於招架、自得二十六分後、就此紀錄停頓、只見菲僑步步高升、積成二十三分、終了上半時、東華僅以三分佔先、</p>
<h3>形勢緊張</h3>
<p>再戰聲起、競爭益烈、吴國霖首開紀錄、加上二分、林敖溜張良雄還敬二只、加上四分、成二十八比二十七、東華呌息、另謀出路、孫寳慶暗渡陰平、吴國霖百步穿楊、增上四分、形勢似又樂觀、但菲僑不甘落人、失之速、收之亦易、林敖溜許澤腰續加兩球、不肯放鬆、分數仍差一分、東華三十二、菲僑三十一、</p>
<h3>突然超出</h3>
<p>當此緊要關頭、東華雖仍佔優、但分數如此接近、足見菲僑來勢不小、而東華危機四伏、岌岌可危矣、果然、轉瞬之間、楊淑蕙遙射一球、鵠的命中、菲僑突然以三十三比三十二超出、從此聲勢愈盛、手法愈熟、左衝右突、無往不利、林登儒籃下躍擲、無有不中、東華至此、陣勢益見雜亂、如一盤散沙、無可收拾、最後結果東華反以三十八比五十二失敗、</p>
<p>菲僑　擲罰犯分　　東華　擲罰犯分</p>
<p>林登儒　八零三十六　錢敬鏞五二一十二</p>
<p>張良雄　七零一十四　馮念華三零二　六</p>

<h3>史高塔杯初賽東華七比零克西商　曁南以一比　和活塞斯　意海軍四比零克沙哥兒　今日優游戰臘克斯</h3>
<p>昨日兩場史高塔杯初賽東華以七比零大勝西商隊、似未見十分賣力目下之西商、平庸無奇、大有不克一擊之勢、曁南以一比一和活塞斯、曁南攻勢極盛、惜左内鋒及左翼稍差、屢失機會、致先以一比零負、最後五分鐘間、賴羅海光之傳送、福將丘正倫將功贖罪攻入一球、遂成和局、另一塲意海軍對沙哥兒之比賽、意海軍以四比零勝、今日下午三時優游對臘克斯作史高塔杯賽於中華棒球塲、茲情分誌如下、</p>
<h3>東華克服西商　結果凈勝七球　戰來成一面倒</h3>
<p>本届東華第一次出戰、在史高塔杯賽中、遭逢西商、相戰九十分鐘、形成一面倒局勢、上三下四、結果東華凈勝七球、裁判派去、</p>
<p>東華隊</p>
<p>萬象華</p>
<p>李　寗　屠開元　陳洪光</p>
<p>周賢言　　　　　馮運佑　李義臣</p>

<p>高　金　　　　　雪　弗　漢　斯</p>
<p>法　平　墨　萊　漢特萊</p>
<p>勃石脫</p>
<h3>兩隊内容</h3>
<p>東華陣綫與前届稍有不同、陳虞添卜野、陳家球退出、於是曹秋亭人選、賈幼良被邀、内部人員、則完全原防、昨日該隊表演、守衛堅固、一如往昔、進攻實力、活潑有餘、硬勁不足、假以時日、當較有生色也、西商S.F.C.人才零落、每况愈下、前鋒漢斯及金勃略能應付、守門平平、法平尙佳、餘子不足道也、惟作戰始終不懈、奮鬥精神値得贊許也、</p>
<h3>越位作罷</h3>
<p>西商迎日應戰、開始十分鐘内、東華顯然佔得優勝地位、萬象華二次挑送、曹賈還脚不愼、良機錯過、李義臣鐵腿起處、自二十碼處直奔入網、乃以越位作罷、嗣後曹秋亭將隨萬氏之後、作勢射門、亦以越位之笛聲而終止、第三次屠開元遠送左陲、萬象華逐影而去、又爲笛聲所阻、越位之分、不可差之毫厘、否則　者觀者均將引爲不安也、</p>
<h3>連中三元</h3>
<p>二十分鐘、轉眼逝去、賈幼良自右挑中、西商防衛疏懈、李義臣一脚開紀錄、西商稍有振作、每進不利、未幾、腹地生變、又成多事之秋、萬氏挑過後衛、賈氏踼中秋亭腿上、彈入門内、成二對零、再五分鐘曹秋亭如駿馬入平野、一瀉千里、進中綫、越内壘單騎叩關、敞人不防、相顧失色、竟痛飲黄龍而歸、上半時成三對零、</p>
<h3>造成七球</h3>
<p>下半場之初、西商擬一鼓作氣、恢復失地、終以實力不及、有志維償、十五分鐘之後、西商防綫崩潰、乃致一發不可收拾、李義臣接得賈氏之球、轉脚射擊、應聲入門、爲當日射擊不之最美麗而又清脆之一球、四球旣勝、東華攻勢益盛、隨後李義臣萬象華曹秋亭又互中一球、造成七對零凈勝之結果、</p>
<h3>曁南和活塞斯　結果一比一　—曁南賴最後之努力—</h3>
<p>曁南與活塞斯之史高塔杯賽、在中華棒球塲舉行、觀者三四千人、曁南於下半時開始後負一球、在最後五分鐘之努力、由丘正倫將功贖罪、攻入一球、結果成一比一和局而終、</p>
<p>曁南隊陣線</p>
<p>丘正倫</p>
<p>顧尙勷　雲逢　　伍樹芬</p>
<p>徐　亨　　　　　徐亞輝　羅海光</p>

<p>愛格爾登P史密斯黎却士</p>
<p>薛巴特</p>
<h3>雙方視察</h3>
<p>曁南之能造成和局、可謂喜出望外、惟上半時曁南攻勢極盛、均以射門稍高、頻頻失機、顧尙勷徐亞輝攻守兼顧、始終不懈、爲全隊功臣、徐亨之守門、穩健非凡、救出險球不少、前線右面尙可、左面實太免强、失機纍纍、活塞斯强悍非凡、防線固鞏、前鋒猛銳、確係勁旅、</p>
<h3>小小接觸</h3>
<p>法官李諾斯一聲動員、活塞斯開球先攻、曁南逼進、計不得逞、丘八躍躍欲試、履次進窺、曁南時露生疏狀態、顧尙勷八面顧到、來者不拒、均被擋回、一度在門四十碼處受罰任意球、「二道頭」史密斯主踼、瓊斯偷渡陳倉、越位而退、曁南丘正倫前進被阻、徐亞輝向前接應三十碼遠射、球如飛矢、略高無效、</p>
<h3>頻頻失機</h3>
<p>活塞斯右翼兩發角球均未得判、亞輝率師進犯、愛格爾登還踢失策·球落門前、伍樹芬經前滑跌、失去機會、梅洪寳東陲起義、羅海光再度發射、略高無效、嗣後又接小梅來球、側鈎模射·球勢甚急、但又略高寸許、勞而無功、</p>
<h3>飽受虚驚</h3>
<p>活塞斯一再被困、卽圖反攻、瓊斯兩次興兵、阻於炭弟鎭祥、無計可施、小梅再傳高球、門側落下、時番營空虚、堡壘指日可下、不意丘正倫心猿意馬·臨陣慌疏、射成野球、觀衆咸對之一嘆、後方反又告急、邊陲胡馬奔騰、擾亂曁南後方、薛巴特横掃而來、如人無人之境、徐亨欲前而止、茂林乘勢發射、令人一驚、幸而球飛門後、安然出險、然已吃驚不小矣、</p>
<h3>城門失守</h3>
<p>瓊斯野心不死、再度侵犯、乘風波浪、勢如破竹、中路人馬、見機追上、包圍城門、徐亨如飛將軍往天而降、抱住阿斗、化險爲夷、往後瓊斯又急射一球、徐亨俯身救出、上半時無功而終、待再戰聲起、丘八鋒芒益露、曁南處處受敵、門前危機四伏、草木皆兵、徐亞輝獨當一面、　於招架、久而久之、被茂林在人叢中攻入一球、由門解滾進、</p>
<h3>天不帮忙</h3>
<p>曁南負球以後、全軍大爲償發、力謀報復、羅海光得球前衝、越過後防、正待攻門、丘八守門赫巴特見機不妙、上前阻止、二人撞個滿懷、互相倒地、張洪藻趕上再射、又被阻出、不料海光經此一撞、脚上受震過猛、當時不能行走、一度揉　、重由進場、梅洪寳七躱敵人、傳球門前、張洪藻衝上頭頂、打個正着、但球彈横木而回、可謂天下帮忙、繼而又在敵門前二十碼踼任意球、亞輝猛踼、球着地射去、守門仆地拍出、伍樹芬挑撥上前、小梅頭頂又彈回、再度失機、負負而已、</p>
<h3>將功贖罪</h3>
<p>羅海光因脚痛不利行走、乃與徐亞輝對調位置、作破釜沉舟、背城借一、籠讓虎踼、聲勢汹汹、左衝右突、銳不可當、壁壘沉嚴之活塞斯、至此不免略有願此失彼之憾、海光在中路截獲敵球、挑送前方、混戰聲中、向無造就之丘正倫、在人馬噪雜聲中、發射一球、竟然中的、將功贖罪、可謂福將、而曁面乃如絶路逢生、造成一比一和局、五分鐘後、比賽告終、炭弟　祥於最後二分鐘時、受傷出埸、</p>

<p>兩會招待情形　昨日計到市敎局潘局長、兒童幸福會胡叔異、趙增祺、周望鶴、陳鶴琴（胡叔異代）、兒童晨報社徐卓呆、中華慈幼協會王貫一、現代兒童社宋青萍、該團兒童七人由商務印書館黄警頑率領參加、各界贈品除兒童晨報一全册外、現代書局贈現代兒童各一册、家庭工業社特贈無敵牙粉一盒及牙膏一打以資鼓勵、席間首由主席胡叔異致詞、繼由徐卓呆宋青萍王貫一黄警頑等相繼致歡迎詞、語多勉勵、繼由該團代表楊永鑫致答詞、</p>

<h3>盡信書</h3>
<p>— 唐弢</p>
<p>咱們中國人最相信書，而咱們中國書最不足信。</p>
<p>譬如說豪俠，只講心地爽直，喜歡抱不平，那是决不夠的，一定要身子會向雲端裏鑽，指頭有一道白光，而且還會追著殺人；萬一碰著了對手，給戰敗了，在千鈞一髮的當兒，死是死不得的，於是便有得道的和尙來救，誰給通風呢？曰：「心血來潮。」</p>
<p>這似乎太荒誔，不能相信，然而並不；除了把兩手像糖炒栗子一樣，在燒熟的黄沙裏炒著外，也竟然還有人，抛别家鄕，身邊不帶分文，凖備飛到武當山，跟道士和尙學劍仙去的。</p>
<p>自們中國人就在這樣思想下活著。</p>
<p>可是「賢明之士」又得反對。因爲這些書畢竟不是正統，而這些人也大都臘子簡單，「上等」和「高等」的中國人是不至於會這樣的。但且慢，隨手來幾個例：（莊子逍遙篇）北冥有魚，其名爲鯤。鯤之大不知幾千里也。化而爲鳥，其名爲鵬。鵬之背不知其幾千里也。怒而飛，其翼若埀天之雲。</p>
<p>（史記）高祖醉行澤中，前有大蛇當徑，乃拔劍斬之。一老嫗夜哭其處，曰：「吾子白帝子也。今爲赤帝子殺之。」</p>
<p>這二部書大槪可算是正統了吧。但爲甚麽又有些像胡說呢？一條魚大到幾千里，而且還會變鳥；一個老嫗的兒子是蛇，忽然又說是白帝子。這究竟怎麽了呢？「賢明之士」郤深信而不之疑。</p>
<p>大槪又得說是古書不足以繩今人了。其實在今人裏，尤其是在天才的今人裏，不足信依舊是存在的。譬如有人說女人的舌尖是壁虎的尾巴，則壁虎的尾巴也便是女人的舌尖了；萬一竟有人摟著壁虎的尾巴去親嘴，那可糟糕呢！</p>
<p>不可信，不足信，但我怕還有人要相信的。</p>
<p>名句不該造漏，索性再來一下。</p>
<p>「河水如呆立的棺。」</p>
<p>這樣的寳貝究竟是怎樣看法的呢？幸而是天才的青年詩人。但這回上當的人可多了。窮人活不下去，相率投河，認爲安然棺殮，屍骨可免暴露。無奈不久便死猪一樣浮起來了。</p>
<p>我並不想勸人少作名詩名文，郤希望大家不要太相信了。書本子不是全靠得住的。</p>
<p>全靠得住的書本子，是不容易存在的！</p>
<h3>關於「柏林中國美展」</h3>
<p>— 符一葉</p>
<p>四個月以前，我曾爲了明年春季在德京柏林舉行的中國美術展覽會寫過一篇短文，那時正在美展開始籌備的時候，自已却不自量地陳出三個意見：一是關於美術品的徵集方面，應公開向全國作家徵求，這樣，作品的數量，質量上方豐富完美。第二是在古代，近代和現代三個時期中的出品，得側重於現代這一部門，至少現代作家的作品應佔半數，固然古代近代的繪畫較現代爲優，這不過增高藝術上的評價，而現階段的中國藝術以及今後整個藝術運動的展開，實憑藉現代作品來窺瞰和推斷。最後一個意見，是希望我們的藝術家改掉那嗜古成癖的不長進脾氣，和假清高的逃避現實的士大夫思想，在畫材方面攝取現代的色相，創作帶點時代性的東西，假如再一味死守老規矩，畫面上還是宗敎領域内的神相佛像，角巾方帽的人物，野寺茅舍的建築，拿這類東西去和外國人見面，人家會懷疑中國還停留在晉唐時代呢！那篇糞文曾寄本埠一家比較談美愛和趣味的報紙副刊，也許是文章不美夠不上趣味，或稿件不是相當人物介紹的原故，給編輯先生抛在字紙簏内了。</p>
<p>到了現在看見一方面美展委員們要出國的消息；别一方面王祈，高愛林等提出質問，今天申報又載籌備委員林風眠，林文錚，齊白石三位再向籌備會建議，這樣一來，我又覺得抛在編輯先生字紙簏裏那篇糞文，並不是怎樣無用的。過去的意見移述在這兒後，再來看這事件的展開吧。</p>
<p>看王祈，高愛林等呈敎部文内，明明是指責劉海粟氏個人的包辦，所以作品的徵集僅限於上海一隅的少數作家，並且又不是優秀的作品。事實上是不是這樣，我們局外人是不會知道的，不過在籌備時期旣没有公開的徵求過展覽過，難免有這樣的疑問，但連到籌備委員林齊諸位均不知道委員們的出國，（見十一日申報）因了别人的不平鳴才來了那三項建議，這，眞敎人莫明其妙了。本來那三項建議早應在開始籌備時注意到的，到了這個時候再來一個第二次徵求，這短促的時間能否達到「普遍徵求」，然後「廣集」「詳選」以「精益求精」呢？訂了兩年餘合約，成立了半年的籌備委員會，但美展作品的徵求還得臨時抱佛脚，這内幕畢竟怎樣，我們局外人且等當事者解答吧！</p>
<h3>「筆名」與「芳名」</h3>
<p>— 于時夏</p>
<p>明代文人，喜用别號，一稱道號。維時道學方盛，講學者多，道號之立，譁衆取敬，所謂「學者稱爲某某先生」是也。而謟諛卑佞之流，亦以媚其所尊事之人，自側陋之腐儒俗士，以至顯達之名公貴人，皆莫不有道號矣。嘗有人爲一詩云：</p>
<p>孟子名軻字未言，如今道號却紛然。</p>
<p>子規本是名陽鳥，更要人稱作杜鵑。</p>
<p>至於今日，能文之士，喜用生僻之筆名，有一人而筆名至十數者。予嘗妄測其故，非不好名，而逃其文名也；非畏辯言，而逃其言責也；殆以時多忌諱，而有不得不隱姓埋名者在乎？又今日之電影明星，歌塲舞女，芳名喜用疊字，不知何人倡始，而和之者彌衆。考之唐代美人，芳名用疊字者亦多，如元稹妾名鶯鶯，張祜妾名燕燕，柳將軍愛妓名眞眞，張建封舞妓名盼盼。又善歌之妓曰好好，端端，灼灼，惜惜，錢塘楊氏曰愛愛，武氏曰賽賽，范氏曰燕燕。天寳中有貴人妾曰盈盈。大歷中才人有張紅紅，薛瓊瓊。又楊虞卿妾名英英。僅就七修類稿所舉，實際當不止此。蓋一時之風當使然，五代宋時猶未改也。今則此一風尙又流行於歌塲戲院間矣。文人之筆名創新，美人之芳名復古，此采風問俗者所當深長思之也！</p>
<h3>遊了佛國（續）</h3>
<p>— 巴金</p>
<p>遊了佛頂山，没有看見一件奇怪的東西，我還想上菩蕯頂去看天燈，但時間已經來不及了。我還要到海灘上去會那朋友，這是我們先前約好了的。我應該趁太陽未落坡」的時候走下山去。</p>
<p>這一晚我們睡得不暢快，外邊有人在打麻將，鬧了許久，後來茶房們又因了分賞錢爭吵起來。到夜深纔靜了下去。早晨我們還没有醒，寺裏接客的人就來敲門把我們喚了起來，說是船到了。我們吃過了早點便跟那人走下山去，時候很早，不過五六點鐘的光景，太陽已經升了起來，空氣很新鮮，一路上就聽見鳥的歌唱，看見樹葉的綠影子。快到碼頭時，我們聽見了輪船的汽笛聲，便趕快跑到碼頭，但船已經開走了。我們看得見那黄色的船身，黑的烟囱，灰黑的烟霧。昨天别人明明告訴我們去上海的船要七八點鐘纔經過這裏，但現在不過六點多鐘船就開走了，而且走得遠遠的，我們没有方法可追趕上去。接着有許多女香客坐了轎子到碼頭上來，行李給人挑着，他們好像很有把握，不會趕脫船的樣子，結果也只得在這裏停一會，說了好些抱怨的話就讓轎夫抬了她們的身子，挑夫挑了她們的行李回去。</p>
<p>照這情形看來，我們恐怕永遠没有機會趕着搭上海的船了。我那朋友在上海一個工廠裏服務，他的歸心就眞正像箭一般，我也不想留在普陀山多看和尙的嘴臉。然而没辦法我們又只得回到寺裏去。這一次更使得那個知客師驚訝了。後來還虧他給我們想了辦法讓我們搭了小火輪到舟山去，在舟山搭船很方便，每天都有小火輪從那裏開往上海。</p>
<p>這早晨十點鐘我們就離了普陀，心裏很痛快，雖然知道我們會在舟山住一個晚上，但那裏有朋友照料我們，會給我們種種的方便，會使我們看見一些新奇的東西，這些東西至少也要比和尙們的嘴臉有趣。</p>
<p>這裏特别說和尙的嘴臉，也是有原因的，因爲在普陀和尙大多了，到處都是。和尙也會應　客人，也會計算銀錢，也會奴使用人，也會做生意，就和普通商人没有兩樣。寺裏有客房，客房就像上海的旅館，新的設備是齊全的，除了伺候客人的茶房外，還有接送客人的接客者。飯菜是素的，但客人也可以買了莗菜帶進去。有錢人人在這裏也可以得着種種的方便。我們曾經在房裏沙發套下面發現過一根烟槍。我們聽見過麻將牌的聲音，只差了看見人呌了娼妓進來。</p>
<p>離開普陀的前一晚，我們曾經和知客師談過一番話，那和尙生得來肥頭大耳，却有一付聰明的頭腦，說話很漂亮，懂得好幾省的方言，他尤其會巴結女香客。他對我們說的話倒是很坦白的。他說：「普陀山的各寺院每年就做這幾個月的生意。但是開銷太大了，這兩年各家競爭太厲害，生意又不很好，所以各家都不免要蝕本。這生意眞不好做，不過許多和尙就靠牠生活，不做又没有辦法」。這意思也很明顯。所以遇着香客上門他們就得大敲竹積了。做一次水陸道塲，起碼得花去千把元。做個小佛事，也要用去百元以上。但紳士家的太太小姐是滿不在乎的。我無意間在另一個廟裏看見了一次水陸道塲，和尙們對於女香客的巴結，我眞找不出話來形容，那付嘴臉只有古典派的畫家纔能夠把牠詳細畫出來。</p>
<p>我們在普陀山是受着相當的優待的，在寺院裏面我覺得比在上海旅館裏還舒服。所以我相信我的叙述裏不會帶有一點偏見。我回到上海就有人問我帶回來什麽印象，我回答說，我遊歷過了一個大商場，在那裏面敗買的貨品是菩蕯，做生意的是一些超等的商人，我自已不過做了一個最不慷慨的顧客。（完）</p>
<h3>兩兄弟（十九）</h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑著李維克譯</p>
<p>隨後他常常有的那種來得異常突兀，迅速，他自已旣不能預料，也不能制住，也不能改變的，他自已覺得像是從另一個獨立而猛烈的靈魂出發來的，那種非出本心的思想之一在他的腦中穿過：「呸！他太蠢了，他不會去這樣享樂，他會和那姓陸的小寡婦結婚。」</p>
<p>他站起身來。</p>
<p>「我讓你一個人去夢想着你的將來罷；我呢，我需要走動走動。」</p>
<p>他和他弟弟握了握手，隨後又用一種非常誠懇的語調說道：</p>
<p>「好啦，我的小哲安，你現在闊啦！我很高興今晚上能夠一個人碰見你，可以對你表白這事是怎樣的使我開心，我是怎樣的爲你慶幸，並且我是怎樣的愛你。」</p>
<p>天性柔和又温順的哲安，聽了這話非常感動，吃吃地回說道：</p>
<p>「謝謝……謝謝……我的好筆爾，謝謝。」</p>
<p>於是筆爾一個人慢慢的打回頭了，手杖掛在臂上，兩手剪在背後。</p>
<p>當他走回到城裏的時候，他又考慮作究竟要作何消遣，他未能盡量散步，因爲遇着他的弟弟，未能盡量賞玩海景，心裏很不高興。</p>
<p>他忽然想到：「我到瑪洛斯科老爹那邊去喝一杯甜酒罷；」於是他又向丹古威而區那方面走去。</p>
<p>他是在巴黎各公立病院見習的時候認識瑪洛斯科老爹的。這是一個因爲政治關係亡命國外的波蘭老頭兒，據别人說，他在波蘭曾經有過一些可怕的故事，他跑來法國重新受了一番考試之後，便執行他的藥劑師的職務。他過去的生活如何，大家一點都不知道，因此在醫院中那些住院見習生和院外見習生之間，稍後在他的隣居裏面，都流行着關於他的種種傳說。這種憑着奇蹟，獲保首領的可怕的反叛者，虚無主義者，弑逆者，不顧一切的愛國志士等等的名聲，引動了羅蘭筆爾的國險而且激越的幻想；他因此和這波蘭老頭兒成了好朋友，可是他並没有從他那邊聽到任何關於他以前的生活的告白。這老頭兒到哈佛爾來開業也還是靠着這青年醫生的力量。他希望這新進的醫生會給他拉到許多顧客。</p>
<p>在這希望還不曾實現的時候，他祇好在他那簡陋的藥房裏過着清苦的日子，一面同他那區内的小有産者和工人做點小生意暫時維持生活。</p>
<p>筆爾常在晚飯後咆去看他，和他閒坐許久，因爲他歡喜瑪洛斯科那寗靜的臉孔和稀有的談話，他覺得他那悠長的沉默是很有意味的。</p>

<h3>運動的今昔觀</h3>
<p>— 錢醉竹</p>
<p>運動，在我國是「我所自存；「譬如六藝」裏頭的「射」「御」兩項，便和現在的運動，一樣包含着鍜鍊體格的作用。而且「其爭也君子，」可見對於運動的道德人也是十分注重。所以當時的人材，都是能文能武。直到後世，才文武介途，鬧成「文不能縛雞，武不能識字」的大害。</p>
<p>記得在我幼年間，學校初創，運動幼稚。項目也很少，僅懂賽跑，跳高，低欄，團體操，器械操，的幾項。那時的敎員，多數只知運動，不知鍛鍊。當校長的，也只知鼓勵學生拚命，代本校出風頭，不知注意學生的體格，不問平日的衛生。青年好勝，拿着七分的體力，作十分的運動，其結果，不知犧牲了多少好學生。每一次運動會，不知隱藏着幾許慘劇。（我便是其中之一，吐血的病，便害了我一生的事業）直到近十年來，這種流弊，才稍稍輕减。但還有拿學生性命當兒戲的，像今年某校學生，因敎師的粗忽，而死於游泳。不過這是少數罷了。以全體而論，確是進了運動的正軌。鍜　體格的，「正　眼藏是認識了。不再是少爺小姐的運動，而是勇健青年的活躍了。</p>
<p>我說這話，是有憑據的；祇要看現在的學生，十分之八，都是肌肉勁歛，骨骼恢張，可見平日有平均發達的訓練，才有這雄健的收穫。莫怪此次的全運會，要創造許多新紀錄了，總之，以前是舍本逐末的畸形運動，現在才是普遍發達的基本鍜鍊。以前是七分的身體，作十分的運動。現在是十分的本錢，作十分的競賽。在國内種種現狀中，是唯一可喜的進步。</p>
<p>最後。我以爲國人對於傑出的人材，如劉長春，符保盧，之類，須要予以安定的生活，免得埋没英雄。（報載老選手朱恩德君　遇到的冷待和漠視多麽可憐）更要愼密的保護，免得被人暗算。須知我們左右，有一個死寃家，他是不許我們有特出人材的。（前例甚多不單指運動方面吾國人材之遭其陰謀者多矣）所以我們若再不知愛護，任其自生自滅，那末下次國際運動，不但不能爭勝，恐怕連如司徒君的「極蹦」，也求不到了。</p>
<h3>期待</h3>
<p>— 庸子</p>
<p>王小二吃了張大個子的虧，終於想不出一個翻本的道理來，而又没有耐性兒上峨嵋山去苦修苦練，以備君子三年報仇，於是惟有交叉了兩臂，躱在門角裏念「阿彌陀佛」祈求着觀音大士，救苦天尊，降厥凶於張大個子，使他吃飯噎死，走路跌死，過橋溺死，六月裏發痧而死。過了些時，眼看着張大個子痱子都不生，噴嚏都不打，於是轉變了方向，日日夜夜的盼望着張大個子合東街上的刀疤阿四，西街上的九二麻子打起架來。而更其盼望的是這二條好漢，聯合着打張大個子。二個服侍一個。張大個子雖是英雄，總也免不了來一下子「狗吃屎」。王小二想到得意之處，便不禁鬆了交叉着的雙臂，用力地在大腿上一拍，打一個哈哈道：「善有善報，惡有惡報，張大個子，你就只會欺我王小二，怎地今天也躺在地上了，漏臉哪。」這便是王小二所日思夜想的復仇方策。雖然刀疤阿四和九二麻子是否會和張大個子鬧翻，是否會得聯合着實行二個服侍一個，果然二個服侍一個了，張大個子是否會玩「狗吃屎」在王小二躱在門角裏的時候，還是一些兒没有把握，但是除此之外，王小二是没有更大的計劃了。</p>
<p>在社會上，像王小二這樣的典型人物，是隨處都找得到的。自然囉，這是最不費力的復仇方法，比了上峨嵋山苦修苦練了三年，才能復仇的，要高上百倍而不止。還有一層，譬如王小二吃了張大個子的虧，眞去練了把式而復仇，似乎太着了痕跡，給人嘲笑着「不肯吃虧」。惟有用這「肚裏明白」的方法，而株守着張大個子玩「狗吃屎」的　　，那麽，一方面旣可暢暢地舒一口氣，一方面還可說上「善有善報，惡有惡報」那一套，總算是陰陽未泯，天理猶存。—這是處世哲學的菁華錄。</p>
<h3>菊花</h3>
<p>— 金樓</p>
<p>又是菊花的季節哪！腦海裏浮起那冷艶無媚的倩影！</p>
<p>誠然，菊花是怪惹人愛的，金絲菊，胭脂菊，大墨菊，以及秋月，羽鵑，獅鬚，珊瑚鈞……是多麽動人的名詞啦！伊那亭亭的身段，襯着墨綠色的葉瓣，美人般的招展在那秋的晴光下，在竹籬邊，在粉墻旁…陶醉了多少人的心魂？</p>
<p>「採菊束籬下，悠然見南山」，古來中國詩人除去喜歡飲酒和看月而外，對於菊的緣分也非常的好！尤其是陶淵明，他對菊的「孤芳晚節」格外讚頌備至，所以後人每以陶淵明爲菊花的唯一的知音，其實豈僅陶淵明而然？自古詩人皆以澹泊自處，憧憬於淡雅的自然之美，因此菊花没有不受一個大詩人愛憐，讚美，吟咏的，即使比較上宦氣最足的王安石，他也有「黄菊有至性，孤芳犯寒威之句，菊的風流，於此可見！</p>
<p>不過現在時代變了，文學家們都以「有女人才有文學」做他們的警句了，而一般新詩人也深受都市物質享用主義的薰陶，抛棄了自然之美的領受，夜夜鍍進那迷人的咖啡座和舞宫，想在那些白制服的女招待和紅旗袍的舞女身上，找他們的所謂「烟士披里純」了！因此凡所吟咏，不是「曲線美」的崇拜，便是「大腿美」的謳歌，那裏面肉的氣息的濃厚，焉得供人誦讀。菊而有知，回想起古時如陶淵明等那些知音，於今盡失！又焉得不黯然呢？凡事都有滄桑，這大槪是菊的滄桑了！</p>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十八回脈脈傳茶含悲慰夫壻怱怱出塞强笑别家人</p>
<p>這幾名話，也可以算是他臨時感觸的話。也可以說是他懶於行動，把這話來推諉的。可是這話一傳到了趙自强耳朶裏去了，他就心裏一動。若是像他這個樣子容易發生感慨，這感慨就多了。他推開房門，看到後面院子裏，我的家庭，他要發生感慨。坐在屋子裏以前常聽到我的脚步聲由這前面院子過去，將來也没有了。這都是他應當回想的，也就是難免他發生感慨的。這可讓人說什麽好哩？趙自强想到了這裏，一切都默然了。低了頭看了自已的皮鞋，將自已兩隻脚尖，胡亂的在地上踢着。桂枝已經是倒好了一杯茶，於是就微笑着送到他面前來。低聲道，别難受，喝這杯熱茶罷。趙自强喲了一聲，突然的站了起來，兩手接着他這個茶杯，向了他道：我有許多話要對你說，可是我一時想不起來，要從那句話說起才好。我是個現役軍人，身子是國家的，只有命令，没有自由，請你原諒我。桂枝笑道：你這是多心了，我並没有說不原諒你呀。趙自强捧了那茶杯，不知道喝，也不知道坐下，只是向了人發呆。桂枝抿嘴微笑着，許久許久，才道：你别是那樣想不開，男子漢大丈夫，總應當轟轟烈烈大幹一塲的。坐下喝茶罷，别想那些了。趙自强聽說，眼睛望了他，慢慢的坐下。不想他無意之中，原已離開了那方凳子　坐下去，却没有挨着那凳子，身子一虚，幾乎是要　跌下去，但是他念到手上還捧着一只茶杯，這是不可摔破的，若摔破了，那就是出門人的不祥之兆，因之下死勁的揑着那只杯子，不肯放鬆，可是茶杯子裏潑出來的熱茶，將手上的皮都　得變成紫色了。右手實在是拿不動了，就把這茶杯，送到了左手上來。（二三一）</p>
<p>兒童的樂園</p>
<h3>幾套簡易的小戲法</h3>
<p>— 銀楓</p>
<p>猜時必中</p>
<p>這套巧妙的戲法，祇要有一隻鬧鐘和一枝鉛筆就夠用了。假使一時找不到鬧鐘，就是掛表或手表都可，不過小些，難看清楚罷了。現在假定用的是一隻鬧鐘，給觀衆看一看，然後請他們推舉一人出來，在鐘面上從一到十二的數目中想定一個數目，暗暗的告訴觀衆。那麽你告訴他（就是觀衆推舉出來想定一個數目的人）說：「現在我用一枝鉛筆，在鐘面上敲，見我在數目上敲一下，你就照你所想定的數目上加一。例如你想定的是六點鐘，那麽我的鉛筆在一點鐘上敲一下，你就加一變爲七；我敲一下，你便加一下，加到了二十，你就喊住，我可以知道你所想定的數目是什麽。」這是非常簡單的，祗要你自已記清楚鉛筆敲鐘面上數目的次數，第一的七記，無論敲在什麽鐘點數目上，都不要緊，第八記却一定要敲在十二點鐘上，第九記一定要敲在十一點鐘上，第十記一定要敲在十點鐘上，這樣依次的輪敲下去，直到想定數目的人，已經加至二十而喊住你了，那麽你的鉛筆頭所敲到的鐘點，就是他所想定的數目，屢試屢騐，百猜百中。</p>
<p>銅元搬塲</p>
<p>你先預備十二個銅元，放在桌上，排列成一方形，每邊四個銅元；然後對觀衆說：「這裏有十二個銅元，排成一個方形，每邊是四個銅元，現在想把每邊變爲五個銅元，依舊是個方形，不能加進或减去一個銅元，就是祇能移動銅元地位，却不能增减銅元數目的，觀衆們能不能？　假使他們說想不會，不會變；那麽你說：「我來變給你們看」。變時，你只要記牢銅元的次序，就是左手方面起到右手方面止，是第一位至第四位；那麽自上而下，是第五位至第七位；再自右至左，是第八位至第十位；那麽自下至上，是第十一位和第十二位。記清了銅元的次序，便容易變了，只要把第五位的銅元，移到第四位的銅元上去放着；再把第二位的銅元，移到第一位的銅元上去放着；再把第十一位的銅元，移到第十位的銅元上去放着；再把第八位的銅元，移到第七位的銅元上去放着；便成了一個每邊五個銅元的方形了，只移動位置，不增减數目。</p>
<p>手帕打結</p>
<p>從觀衆那裏借一塊手帕來，再敎他們中間的任何一個人來拿手帕，執住手帕的兩隻相對的角；就是一手執着一端。然後請他打成一結，却不許脫手把所執的手帕角放鬆的。假使他不知道這套戲法的究竟，無論如何打不成的；因爲要把手帕打一個結，一定要把手帕的兩角交叉·再反一角向下向内的一穿，才能打結。現在不許脫手，不能放鬆，要打一結是不可能的。會變戲法的，却是容易，欲做小魔術家的小朋友，不彷來一試。祇要把你的兩手腕交叉過來，置於胸前，然後敎一位觀者，把手帕的一端，向手後胸前的空處穿進相交處，給你執住；例如你的手腕交叉了，右手在内，左手在外，那麽由交叉處穿進的一端，你把左手執住，未穿進的一角，由你的右手執住。　手腕依舊要交叉，不能移開的。）這時的手帕，一半在内，一半在外了。然後你執住手帕的兩端，而把手腕向後退出，不再交叉，手帕隨之而打成一結。不是没有脫手放鬆所執的兩手帕角而打成一個結嗎？</p>

<p>業餘漫談</p>
<h3>人而猶不如獸乎？</h3>
<p>— 公樸</p>
<p>一星期前記者特抽功夫到中華學藝社去聽海京伯馬戲班訓練野獸專家的「如何訓練野獸」的演講，因爲十日前我亦曾化了六角大洋去看過一次馬戲，當時覺得許多野獸竟被訓練得非常服從，守規則，且有團體的紀律，卽深深的欽佩訓練者的得法，而以毫不知一點訓練野獸的方法爲憾寕，所以一得到學藝社的演講消息，就决心要去一聽。聽的結果很滿意，亦很有感觸。</p>
<p>那位訓獸專家的演詞大意是先叙述各種獸類的性格，據說諸獸中以海狗爲最聽　而我們所知道的馬却反很不容易施敎，至於其他如獅虎熊象等野獸亦均各有其個性與特點。訓練時所最要注意的一點，就是不要敎以違反牠們個性的動作，要本諸牠們的特點去發展其個性，這是訓練野獸者所應知道的第一原則。</p>
<p>其次講到訓練的方法，則謂須有忍耐心，須依照敎授的方法，參酌個人的經騐，逐步的施以基本動作，複雜的訓練，以及不斷的演習，直到純熟决無錯誤的時候爲止，但主要之點，尤在能賞罰分明，訓練者要充分的得到各獸的信仰心。但是這種信仰心的取得，是很不容易的，必須時時要使該獸注意你的動作，使牠能漸漸了解訓練者的愛心，然後方能作各種表演技術的訓練。這是訓獸的第二原則。</p>
<p>記者聽了這訓獸專家的一篇演講後，一時心中發生許多的感想與疑惑：第一，我深覺海京伯等不獨是訓獸專家、卽稱之爲敎育大家實亦有過之而無不及。我們知道上面所叙述的種種訓獸的原則，固與當代許多敎育人的原理没有什麽不同。所不同的，就是這種原理却能實行到——不可理喻，時刻要防備野性暴發的—野獸的身上去，而對於所謂萬物之靈的人類的敎育實施，倒反不能充分的採用這個發展個性，取得信仰的兩大原則，並且實際上還有許多根本違背這個原則的方法，在大我數敎人的學校中存在着。還有一個更不同的結果，卽訓獸的專家假如不依照這敎育原則，野獸就要不受訓練，就要反抗，馬戲就做不成，根本違背了做生意的宗旨。至於現在學校敎育的目的，乃在敎育青年適應現實的政治社會制度的環境，發展個性，自由信仰、這雖說是應當實施的敎育原理，但是不適合於現實的環境制度，所以人的發展個性的敎育原理雖然合理，却不能見諸實行！</p>
<p>若是我們再進一步問，爲什麽發展個性的敎育原理是不適合於現在的政治社會制度呢？這是很簡單的問題，因爲現在的一切制度大致是建築在不平等的基礎上，人類個性總是反對不平等，於是人類的個性若是發展得愈充分、則反抗不平等的制度就要愈加激烈。要維持不平等制度的人們是很了解這個關鍵所在的，所以他們對於發展個性的這個原理是十二分小心的應用，决不願輕於嘗試而走到作繭自縛的路上去。至於這種違反個性的敎育爲什麽不能施之於野獸而獨能加之於人呢？這是因爲人的個性雖强，但是潛伏得很深，是需要充分的敎育與環境的啟迪，方能發揚廣大，所以除了少數天生個性稍强與受有特殊環境激刺的人們外，大多數是容易受環境物質的支配，而變成現實環境中的一份子——没有個性，没有信仰的人物。</p>
<p>此外還有一點小感觸，那就是「馴良未必是聰慧者」。我們看馬是比許多野獸馴良了，胆馬的智慧去並不大。現在有一班人，很討厭有個性的人，嘉獎不爭氣的屈伏者或是所謂馴良者，照這樣下去，充其極將要使全中國人都變成馬而已。不過馬在馴獸專家的眼光中並不重視，因爲牠是個性或是野性被湮没的不聰明的笨伯呀！</p>
<h3>外埠郵政代辦所三萬女工的不嫁主義</h3>
<p>— 譯霜萍女士</p>
<p>廣東順德通訊</p>
<p>我鄕居生活中，每天早晨最討厭的是絲廠的汽笛，那知道這汽笛就是整村女人生活的象徵呢。</p>
<p>講到絲廠，我們南方倒有一百多問，平均每間擠着六七百的女工</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>。她們每天自朝至暮嘗受着臭氣的刑罰，直挺挺地坐在一張板凳上，對着一個開水盆和一個冷水盆，後面熱烘烘的挨近熱喉管，被開水燙熟了的手，又要被冷水夾攻了一陣。因此，她們的手永遠皺得像猴子的臉，糙得像玫瑰花枝。臉給汗珠流得慘白，嘴唇青黑，濕透的衣裳緊貼着身體而又不能脫掉，尤其是眼睛被烟霧環繞得看不清，所以到了中年便不中用了。眼睛要跟着向上跑的絲條跑，偶不留神，繭多了一隻或少了一隻，使絲條粗了或細了，那你的工錢不要想完全不缺。前面是水蒸氣，後面又是火氣，弄成個「一身之中氣候不同」。祗知道穿紅着綠的小姐，太太們，是絶不會意識到製物主人的艱辛的！</p>
<p>她們所受廠主的苛罰，眞是不勝枚舉！廠方罰例是這樣：每天上午六時返工，如你遲十分鐘到廠就要吃閉門羹，當天的工錢不發猶可言，但還要扣一天工錢來儆戒是最無理不過的！至於絲繅得粗或細的苛罰，那更非筆墨所能形容了；如你稍有抗辯時，就得無條件的被開除。開除之後，廠方還要遍發通知書到毘鄰各廠去，這時那被革的女工，非離鄕背井去找尋工作，便永遠要失業了！</p>
<p>其次，工頭野蠻的壓迫和侮辱，也是女工們的家常便飯。假如你是年青貌美或會獻媚些的，那不論你的絲繅得粗或細，是絶不會被罰扣的；但那些老太婆及那些面少血色的女工，就常要當心她們失業的到來，即使她們在當繭上市時一時不至失業，但那些無理的苛罰和工頭獸性的侮辱也已經使她們夠受了！呵！工頭們是很會享福的，他們不時要尋女工的開心—玩弄她們，撫摸她們的臉孔和乳房！</p>
<p>她們完全没有反抗的勇氣，不過有時被壓迫得過於反常了—如工頭們拿着掃帚，柴爿來拷打女工時，那便像俗語說：「佛都擊出火來了」，她們就像蜂擁般地騷擾起來，或擁到機房把總機的制關上—呌做「攪蛤」，或將所有的機車上的絲剪掉—呌做「竹絲鷄」。但不論怎樣的騷動，也只能堅持到五分鐘，一見廠方出了恫嚇的佈告時，她們又蜂擁般擠回那可怕的活地獄—工廠去了—這是自我職業介紹回音</p>
<p>璞女士：請於每日下午二時至四時駕臨大西路四號與李女士接洽。（上海肺病療養院總院啟）</p>
<p>因爲一鄕或幾鄕中祗有幾間絲廠，那些不能抛離家鄕的女工便不得不屈服了！不返工的只有那些被打傷的女工，她們躺在被窩裏呻吟着，也没有錢去就醫，而尤其不幸的便是被工廠藉端開除了！</p>
<p>她們有着一種奇怪的思想和主義，那就是不嫁主義。那六萬多的女工，思想還不免受着封建的遺傳性，除了要仰事俯畜者之外，其餘家庭經濟可觀一點的，便會把她們一天一天的工錢積蓄起來，而這一種人也就是抱不嫁主義的人，其人數要佔女工總數百分之五六十。她們不嫁的原因：一則是習俗的相沿，二則是她們經濟稍能獨立。所以有的女工雖曾被父母作主嫁了人，但她也仍必竭力設法擺脫之，這呌做「不落家」，也有的將自已積蓄的血汗工錢拿來贖回自已的身軀。</p>
<p>那些不嫁主義者的女工們，每人都有一個同性愛；儼然夫妻的共同生活着，或是十多個同樣的女工彼此　合着共住在一個房子（俗稱「姑婆屋」）裏面。總之，女工們抱獨身主義，無非是她們受了資本主義社會壓迫的一種反響而已。</p>

<h3>我謀殺了人</h3>
<p>— 谷水</p>
<p>失業者</p>
<p>心境是異常地空虚，什麽事都似乎想不了；若要蹙起了眉頭終日思索着該怎樣處置自已那些問題，也許我的心會被弄得麻痺起來，而陷入瘋狂的狀態。所以，近來是祇有將自已幽禁在狹小的房間裏，擯棄了一切苦痛的思想，度着欺騙自我的日子。心，是像疆屍一樣的黯黑。</p>
<p>那天下午，友人青山君帶着笑容出現在我的房裏，我正怪他騷擾我的靈魂的平安，他却朝着我噴話塊了：「朱先生打給我一個電話，呌我通知你，說是某處要用一個書記，月新三十五元，問你願不願幹？」</p>
<p>遭受了很久的失業而弄得灰暗不明了的心，頓時像透了點光亮般的，興奮了起來：「是眞的麽？朱先生怎麽說？」</p>
<p>「呌你先自斟酌一下，今晚上往他那邊走一遭，想來這事情是可以幹的，反正你又空坐着没事做，每個月弄這麽三四十塊錢也是好的。」</p>
<p>「好吧，不過幹書記這勾當，也是很苦的事！」</p>
<p>「没有辦法囉，現在弄口飯吃實在不容易呀！」</p>
<p>於是友人回去了，將這僅有的快樂與幸運留給我。</p>
<p>那晚上，便雇了一部黄包車，到朱先生那邊。他是我從前在一個學校裏念書時的先生，因爲那時候和他有很好　感情，所以，自從我離開那個學校以後，飄泊了三年，他都是常常關心着我的。這一次，我又從遠處跑到上海來。剛來的那一天，到過他的家裏，請我喫了一頓飯，還特地打了兩斤老酒請我喝。他的對於我的誠摯的感情。實在已經從師生的關係變到朋友的關係了。</p>
<p>走進他的家，迎面碰見的是朱師母，她像慈母般的親熱地照呼我，引我到了朱先生的房間裏。朱先生見了我就問：「青山告訴過你了麽？」</p>
<p>「告訴過了，不過這事情恐怕很苦吧？」</p>
<p>「也没有什麽，大槪是每天擬點文稿，抄些東西。」</p>
<p>「呌他幹點什麽事？一個月能弄到幾多錢？」朱師母也怪關心似的，這樣問着朱先生。</p>
<p>「某處的書記，月薪三十五元。」</p>
<p>「呌他弄這樣低微的事，太不適合了！」</p>
<p>「唏，有什麽辦法呢！在現在，你要弄到這點數目，也是難事呢！就說這個位置，託我的人也有四五個，寫信到那邊自荐的也有十多個，你眞不知道，如今要找飯吃的人眞多得像過江的鯽魚呢。」</p>
<p>「像谷君那樣的才具，幹這種事總太可惜了。」</p>
<p>「雖然可惜，也没有辦法，你不先弄口飯來吃，是你危險的。將來的希望，要慢慢的來。如今像你那樣被時代壓抑在這社會層裏的，眞不知有多少呢！」</p>
<p>「我也不覺得什麽可惜，没有飯吃的人，還容許你說什麽希望和將來麽？」</p>
<p>「那麽你明天就上辦公廳吧，我給你這名片，免得到那裏他們認不得你。一切要當心點，盡自已的責任，先幹一下再談吧。」</p>
<p>於是我就告辭了出來。過了一個比較愉快的夜晚，第二天早晨，換上一套比較體面的衣服，我就上辦公廳了。</p>
<p>到了那裏，我將朱先生的名片遞給一個戴着一副大眼鏡，兩撇鬍子，啣着一根大雪茄的人，他就滿口很好很好的呌我坐到一張辦公桌的前面，指點給我許多東西。一時，我的面前就攤滿了卷宗，呈文紙，擬稿簿……許多不曾熟識的東西，算是開始辦公了。</p>
<p>那人又拿來了十多封信，說都是自荐要來謀我這位置的，呌我先一一回覆了他們。我就一封封地看了一遍。我一時呆住了，好像有十多張愁苦的臉孔，像在期待着什麽般的臉孔，都在向我卑視着；我又彷佛看見他們全是身後跟着一批妻兒，被生活緊壓壞了的人。當我寫着一封封回答這些人的信時，我彷佛覺得自已變成一個謀殺人的兇手了，不由的眼裏滲出幾滴淚水來。</p>
<p>下午五點鐘，我退出辦公廳，慢呑呑地在回家的路上踱着，心裏像担負了千斤的苦痛，喉頭像梗住了什麽。</p>
<p>「一九三三年的上海是充滿着悲劇的塲所，一九三三年的中國是整個兒　着苦難的國家—」我這樣想着，口裏念着：「三十五，三十五……」</p>

<p>在幾個月以前，當我每次經過江灣路上建築中的日本陸戰隊司令部的新址，看見許多同胞在日兵荷着槍監視下工作的時候，總不免要想起這個不大不小的問題：「爲什麽他們一定要給敵人工作呢？」當然，我相信，凡稍有點血氣的人都會覺着這問題的嚴重性吧！或者有人會說：「這些人都是小工，没有受過敎育，所以是缺乏國家槪念的呀！」但是，我可以斷言，我們同胞的知識份子，替日本雇主工作的亦不在少數；而且不止上海一隅是如此，就是天津，青島，漢口……總之，凡是日人勢力所及的商埠，這種現象也是到處可以發見的！</p>
<p>那些喪盡天良的漢奸和奸商，我們固然不必去說他們，但是那些爲日本人工作的同胞，决不見得個個都是没有良心的吧！總不至於會個個都認賊爲父的吧！那麽，他們爲日人工作的原因究竟在那裏呢？</p>
<p>有一次，我偶然向一個在日本機關服務的中國人提出這個問題，他的回答是：「假使我不同日本人工作，看社會會給我飯吃？」這句話，聽來雖然有點不合理，但是細細地推敲下去，亦不無理由在其間，如果他脫離了日本雇主，社會上譏笑他的人倒有，同情他的人是没有的，就是有，也不過是那些「有心無力」的份子吧了！結果，他只有加入失業者的一羣！因此，如果社會不能設法替他們解决生活問題，也就不能非離他们的所爲！</p>
<p>我不是爲在日本雇三處工作的同胞辯護，更不是勸人爲敵人工作，我不過是希望社會能多　地安　這一種的人。愛國是人人應盡的義務，但是誰也不能餓着肚子去愛國！</p>

<h3>蘇聯的人道</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>在蘇聯第一個五年計劃中，發展水</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>道的工作，佔了很重要的地位。蘇聯的土地廣大，河流交錯，而奔流數千里的大河，爲數甚多。廣用和改造舊有的河道，開鑿許多新的水道，這對於國家工業化將發現許多新的區域；對於麵包，原料，煤油，機器，建築材料等等的大批運輸，將開闢許多新的道路，對於各邊疆和落後區域的經濟與文化的建設，將造成更有利的條件。第一個五年計劃的完成，使蘇聯的容貌爲之一新，使蘇聯的水道大起變化。在五年計劃中人工河道的最大工程之一，就是白海——波羅的海運河的開鑿。</p>
<p>這條運河聯絡兩海——波羅的海與白海，共長二二七啓羅米達。一九三一年十一月蘇聯政府决定開鑿這條運河，並把這一工作付託國家政治保衛局去辦理。這便是白海—波羅的海運河的開鑿的起點。在今年六月底，國家政治保衛局副主席耶果達已經向蘇聯政府作了一個關於造成這條人工運河的報告：</p>
<p>「一九三一年十一月底開始建設的白海——波羅的海運河，至一九三三年六月二十日已經告成了，這就是說，一條工程很偉大的運河的造成，只費了一年又九個月的時間。</p>
<p>水道人民委員會，已經仔細地考查了白海——波羅的海運河的一切設備，所有堤壩，水閘，水電技術等等，都是做得十分完善的。現在蘇聯水道人民委員會已從政治保衛局接受了白海——波羅的海運河，並將這條運河歸入蘇聯航行水道之列。從此蘇聯又增加了一條新河道了。</p>
<p>這條運河的成功，把蘇聯最重要的北方港口的距離要縮短四倍。以前由列寗格勒至阿爾漢格爾的海道，共長二八四零海哩，現在由於這條運河的成功，該海道已經縮短到六七四哩。此外，以前由波羅的海至白海必須經過許多國家的港口，要繞行斯堪的納維亞沿岸，現在由於這條運河的成功，使蘇聯在北方的船泊可以完全航行國内的水道，再不要經過他國的海港了。這條運河的成功，對於北方的森林，木材，礦産及天然富源的開闢給以便利的道路，而對於北方生産力的發展更有莫大的推動。」</p>
<p>在建設社會主義的蘇聯，其生産力發展的速度是任何資本主義國家所夢想不到的。由於生産力發展的迅速，對於水道運輸的要求，也異常增大；所以蘇聯對於發展水道運輸比資本主義國家來得特别注意。</p>
<p>社會解剖室</p>
<h3>現代社會的個人主義</h3>
<p>— 竺安石</p>
<p>個人主義，乃是私有制度下的産物。人類的社會，自從原始共産制崩潰以後，不久也就確定了私有制的支配，且中經封建社會，一直到現代資本主義社會，一切都建築在這私有制的上面，以私有制爲基礎，因而個人主義也就成了這些社會的重心。不過，在封建時代，因爲社會的關係並不複雜，農奴雖是隸屬於領主，成爲領主的附庸，然領主還相當保障農奴的生活，所以個人主義的色彩，還不算十分濃厚。但到了資本主義時代，情形就完全不同，不但社便關係非常複雜，即個人與個人之間，也只有剝削關係的存在，此外所謂自由，不過是財産私有的自由而已。總之，在這個時候，個人主義不僅表現得十分明顯，且異常發達。</p>
<p>所以，個人主義是現代資本主義社會組織的原則，而是以個人爲本位，個人爲中心的，且只認個人是唯一實在的東西，社會不過是完成個人目的的一個手段。於是就根本忽視個人與個人間之有機的關係，而相信個人獨立的存在，因之社會一切的權利，也就成爲劃定的個人不可侵犯的領域而出現了。</p>
<p>這種觀念，是與所謂以社會爲本位的社會主義的立塲正相反對的。因爲社會本位的立塲，是認社會爲唯一實在的東西，不認有個人獨立的存在，而且個人要作爲社會全體的一部分才有意義，就是個人的目的也應該是融合於社會的目的的。所以，經濟組織若是在這個原則之下而構成的，那末，對於構成員的各個人的經濟生活，社會便都有保障的責任，且爲了達到這種目的，設立一個公共的機關，使之管理社會的財富之生産及分配。所以這種的社會關係，才是合理的社會關係。</p>
<p>但在個人主義的，個人本位的社會，對於各個人的經濟生活，社會則不認有保障的必要，財富之生産，是基於各個人的意思而生産，分配也是基於各個人的意思而分配，這樣，便演成所謂相互間的交換和賣買那種自由的個人行爲的結果。所以在這一個社會中的各個人之經濟的活動，不是爲意識的，計劃的所統御的，而是意識着各自經濟利益的個人主義的活動。各個人都依據自已的立塲，互不相犯，且是都不能爲他人所犯的樣子，可以說是立在相互敵對的對立和競爭的關係上。社會的自身，也是就這種個人意識活動的結果而生成着。所以個人主義可謂爲現代社會的本質。</p>
<p>不過在這種以個人爲本位，而承認其利已的活動，對於追求營利的事情而抱着自由主義的社會，結局是生産和分配的無統制，經濟的無政府狀熊，同時則引起社會的經濟的混亂的結果，並使經濟的優越者，支配着，搾取着經濟的弱者殆無已時。這就是說，資本家本着他個人主義的利已心和貪慾心，不僅光是延長勞動的時間，還得儘可能的使勞動者行激烈的勞動，以滿足他們的私慾。因之經濟的活動自由和財産私有制，否認了社會構成員的生存權，而所有失業，飢餓、犯罪等等悲慘的事情，也都將伴着資本主義的發展，並跟着發展而來的經濟恐慌，一天厲害一天。</p>

<p>職業譚藪</p>
<h3>人格與職業的成功</h3>
<p>— 何清儒博士演講張書庚筆記</p>
<p>職業的構成，有二大因素，卽：（一）人，（二）事。職業的成功必先要有「人」與「事」的適合。做一件事達到最高的限度，那纔可說是職業的成功。</p>
<p>要達到職業成功的境地，人格最要注意。常常看見有許多人很可惜，因他們的人格欠缺，使事業失敗；在我們的親友中間可找的實例很多，或因脾氣不好，或因性情不好，或因與同事合不來，以致妨碍他繼續服務。</p>
<p>人格是對於「人」和對於「事」的反應，綜合起來的一個名詞。他對我怎樣態度，我對他怎麽樣？他對我什麽行爲，我對他什麽行爲？人格不是單獨的一個名詞，是言語，行爲，態度，觀念綜合而成的一個名詞。</p>
<p>那幾件性格是成功的？各人的分類不同，分起來幾十種幾百種也不止，將没有講完的日子。現在我把與成功最有關係的，與成功的道路不相背馳的幾種提出來，討論一下：</p>
<p>（一）創造　要職業成功，自已必得要有一種創造事業的性格。譬如有一個木匠造椅子發財了，於是第二第三第四人都設廠製造椅子，結果把椅子的市場打壞了；其實，如另找一條新的路走，也可以得到與他同樣的勝利的。我的意思不是不要與别人一個樣子，不過不要一切都與人一樣而没有創造「新」的方法。</p>
<p>（二）誠懇　並不是不說謊就算是誠懇了；誠懇就如做一件事，無論大小，終要有一個結果出來，下一分努力終有一分結果。無論大事小事都要認眞去做，認眞得好的結果，不認眞得壞的結果；要顧到因果的關係，不要馬馬虎虎的做事。想不勞而獲，或想用最容易的方法去做，這是不可能的事。出一分的勞力，得一分代價；要把勞力用在得當的地方，集中於一事。</p>
<p>（三）試騐　有許多事要試許多次，才可得到牠的結果，甚到要試騐幾百次，幾千次，幾萬次也不一定，平常的事也不是一次可以成功的，所以要有試騐的態度。試騐精神與職業成功是很有關係的。</p>
<p>（四）合作　一個人出外做事有兩種必要應付的：（甲）天然的勢力，（乙）人爲的勢力，都要與牠們合作才可以成功。例如建築工程師對於天然的勢力不合作，如用原料而對於氣候與地勢不考察，他的工作一定要失敗；對於各個工頭不合作，他也不能建築成功。</p>
<p>發展人格必要有相當的準備應該做的：（一）看一看我自已，分析我自已，什麽是我的長處？我的短處是那幾點？那幾樣是我的特長？那幾樣我缺少的？（二）分析我所要做的職務方面需要什麽品格，再把兩方面對照一下，看看我缺少什麽，長於什麽，這樣才可講到發展上面去</p>

<h3>青年時代的慕沙里尼（四）</h3>
<p>— 嚴勁草女士</p>
<p>「好嗎？」警察這樣的問他。</p>
<p>「你好嗎？」他也問警察。</p>
<p>「你在這兒做什麽？」警察說。</p>
<p>「我看守印刷器具，這是你知道的！」他說。</p>
<p>「起來！」警察的臉孔忽然嚴厲起來，慕沙里尼只好打了幾個呵欠，隨着警察一同走。</p>
<p>就這樣，慕沙里尼進了牢門。在一間狹小的拘留所裏，在一位有殘疾而齷齷不堪的年老罪犯的陪伴下，度過了他好幾天的食宿無憂的不自由的生活。</p>
<p>長期的流浪使慕沙里尼的思想漸趨於革命。他到了日内瓦，在那裏混鬼了許多時候，居然能夠常常和文人政客們相往還。這些人都崇拜他的天才，志趣和毅力，所以無不樂與之交，而他在那時候，也能常常執筆爲瑞士和意大利的雜誌寫論文，有時演講一些關於社會主義和國際形勢之類的問題，不但博得勞工界的同情，就是　一些智識階級份子，也有很多人爲他的言詞所掀動的。這時他對於「民主政治」，已經開始了攻擊的態度，所以瑞士當局，就非常注意他的行動，隨時在暗中加以監視。</p>
<p>但是慕氏並不因瑞士政府的監視而稍藏他思想言論的鋒芒。他的行動仍然像行前那麽激烈，到處煽動，到處搗亂。瑞士警察生性這位青年激烈派妨害了所謂共和國的治安，便下令驅其出境。於是慕沙里尼只好逃亡到洛桑，在那裏寫了一封給他朋友魏思博士（DAWyss）的信，而這位博士是駐日内瓦的社會黨代表：</p>
<p>「我方從日内瓦報紙上得着一種消息，知道你預備呈請瑞士聯邦國　收回驅逐我出境的命令——這個命令是警察總監提出的，我有一個極短的自傳，不妨叙述出來作你的參考資料。我十九歲就到瑞士來了，起初在洛桑做正當的職工，後來回到意大利探訪母親，不久便和朋友唐拿聽尼（Danatini），他是一位政治犯，同住在法國邊境阿利馬西（Annemass）地方在這個地方我們想創辦一種「國際的社會主義評論」，可是没有成功。在一九○四年三月一日，我到日内瓦去，想在大學校登記；他們一定會告訴你，硬說我是無政府黨，這是完全不確的。最近幾年，我寫了很多的著作和演說詞，我出錢捐助紐約的平民報，盧甘洛的勞工奮鬥報和米蘭的前驅報，從這些行動裏，老實說，警察們是找不出一點無政府嫌疑的材料的。在瑞士和意大利，都以爲我是社會黨。有一次我在齊里西會議席上所提出的議案，雖很含有革命性，但也不能斷定爲帶有「無政府色彩」。我在日内瓦躭擱了四十天，消磨大部份的光陰於大學圖書館中。警察們想在他們的功績簿上多註上幾筆，簡直把我横拉直扯地拉到罪罟裏，這是他們的慣技；然而一切報告没有一件是眞的。當我接到這一種逐客令之後，想把房門的鑰匙退回去，想清理一下物件，想和我的律師討論；可是他們不由分說，刻不容緩的逼着我就道。當局告訴我的律師，說我已經回到阿利馬西，這是他們恐怕律師嘵嘵置辯，故意用鬼話騙人。其實，我是被迫乘車到喬梭，然後趕回意大利去。我這一番才認識了共和國的眞面目，把共和國保障自由的假招牌索性丢在一邊。這一次的被逐，不但是共和國的恥辱，就是同樣事件發生於君主國，也許是無意識的舉動吧！現在我到了洛桑，希望不再受他們的壓迫。我想那位警察總監想要自圓其說，祇怕不大容易的吧！」</p>
<p>從這封信裏看起來，我們可以知道慕沙里尼這個貧苦的青年幾年以來的流浪無告的生活，已使他的思想和行動有了顯著的轉變。這時候的慕沙里尼，他已經不是頑皮不堪的野孩子，也不是年青氣盛，忠君愛國的軍人。他是一個爲貧苦階級謀幸福的努力者，也是一個好學不倦的青年，而且還參加了社會主義的　的組織。雖然他不免爲瑞士政府所驅逐，但是，他却毫不因此而灰心餒氣。</p>

<h3>中國電影藝人訪問記（十八）（續上月二十八日）</h3>
<p>— 沙基</p>
<p>（八）「殘春」導演張石川（上）</p>
<p>關於這位先生，我想有不少人知道，他是中國電影界一個巨頭。爲什麽呢？我們祗消在他的業務上來認識；他是明星公司的支配者，但同時也是一個藝術家。企業家而兼藝術家，二家合而爲一，其偉大也就可想而知的了不起。</p>
<p>因其偉大而必爲能者，因能者而必多勞，所以，於是乎，直到現在才能在他的百忙之中得着一個訪問的機會。</p>
<p>我眞覺得抱愧，爲了這麽一點小事，居然勞他擯棄了一切要公從二層樓跑到導演部來和我相見。</p>
<p>假如我們相信江湖相士的術法的話，那末一看着他的面貌和身材，便可决定他是一個了不起的貴人。你看罷，他那肥胖的大臉，他那不高而很粗的身軀，簡直是一個十足的大花面。那一身的肉啊，眞是修養得太好了，没有那一點不顯出他的福氣。現在已是很發達，將來還要發達。雖然不必一品當朝，但　少已生就了八抬的氣格。這種氣格是很足以驚人的了。</p>
<p>一段胡說之後，現在得記載他的談話了。</p>
<p>「張先生到南京拍運動會的影片，對於運動會有什麽好的意見？」這是我問。祗聽得他說：</p>
<p>「今年的運動會成績很好，健兒很多，有許多項目打破了全國記錄。不過較比遠東運動會却很差，更不及日本。但是因爲有好些運動員生活上發生困難，爲了吃飯問題不能解决，不能很充裕的練習下去。但是這中間有好多是很有希望的運動員，他們如能生活安定的繼續努力下去，一定不過多時就有很好的成績。所以我希望政府當局，應當能夠劃出一步份錢來，穩定他們的生活，讓這些健兒繼續練習下去。現在據說劉長春是百元一月，還有許多是没有的。我想不如將那些好的運動員安插到政府各部中去。假使說一百人，祗消十萬元，政府不過是一個很小的數目，可是明年的遠東運動會，二十四年的全國運動會，那就大有希望了。……」（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「柔情曼歌」</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>Too　Much　Harnony</p>
<p>—派拉蒙出品大光明開映—</p>
<p>前天看過了英國的「一夕良機」，昨天又看到這「柔情曼歌」，由於二者的故事，頗有相同之處，未嘗不可以同時提及。譬如說前者「The　Chance　of　Night　Time」，叙述律師在一天晚上換上一個妻子，而後者「如此調和」也是寫一對青年男女因爲情調意合，便捨棄原來的愛人，而好合以終。二者主題相同；假使在未結婚之前，發現比原來的愛人更好的對象的時候，應當獲取你所愛的。</p>
<p>這種閒怀逸致的作品，其無績極性的表現現實，自不待言。然而比較的說，「一夕良機」在故事的含蓄方面，其横的發展，却比後者來得充實多了。一般的說，英國片不同於美國片的輕浮，在這裏又可得着一個例證。</p>
<p>可不是麽？在這一影片中，我們就祗能看到一些所謂華美的外形。由於所謂All　StarCast的出演，我們固然不能忽視它的藉此號召的營業方法，而另一方面製片者對於這一影片製作的愼重，也可同時窺探出來。但是這喪的全班明星並不如「大飯店」的全班明星那般有成績，這並不是說這裏的都是次等明星，而是說至少在内容方面，就不像「大飯店」那般够味。</p>
<p>因此僅僅是形式的誇張，决不能提高作品的估價，何况演出也並非盡善盡美。這裏我們可更具體一點說明；編劇者要使洛雪和艾迪離婚，而用盡方法，　歌舞團的老　夫人從中破壞。更說明她所以要從事破壞，並非出於勉强，而是採取了復仇的方法。這一點在寫作技巧上是很可取的。但是作者却弄巧反拙的敎一人冒充火柴大王的兒子，而洛雪也就居然相信，未免太兒戲了。至於寫虚榮的洛雪爲了認識了大富翁的兒子，便毅然和那聲樂家解除婚約，　是相當現實的了。</p>
<p>此外作者將男女主角的戀愛場面·都在戲劇中展開，下意識的指明這無非是戲劇的戀愛罷了。然而這始終是作者意料之外的收獲。</p>
<p>以上是劇本方面的檢討，而在演出方成，我們有如下的意見。</p>
<p>導演者是儘可能的探用了現代化的歌舞形式，充分的展示出美國片對於形式的瘋狂。在那幾場歌舞中，比較的最精采的自然是最後那利用「風」的一場。然而這也不過是說他更瘋狂的賣弄肉的誘惑罷了。假使美國片中除了這些自暴自棄的塲面之外，還有什麽能顯出他的特色呢？</p>
<p>因爲導演對於演員的支配，並不能十分得當，同時又必須使每一個明星都有戲做，於是我們在這裏並没有看到某一演員有着獨到的表演。卽就男女主角來說，除了男主角Bing　Crocby有着一副響亮的歌喉，以及女主角也能那般嫻靜之外，差不多就没有看到更好的表演。然而就他二人來說，那末比之前回在同一戱院開映的「大學生的幽默」，也略見遜色。</p>
<p>至於佈景方面，我們却看到幾個很可寳貴的舞台裝置。如那橋頭的夜景，店面的裝置，以及風吹落花等等，都爲這一影片生色不少。</p>
<h3>「血路」</h3>
<p>— 曼倩</p>
<p>—中央映—</p>
<p>向來，除了所謂三大公司以外的幾家小資本製作者，對於出品方面，因爲機械和人材的缺乏，所以常是另取一條途徑。譬如說，自從去年電影界轉變以後，換一句話說，幾家大公司注重於「現實的題材」以後，其餘的許多小製作者，仍然一貫地攝製那些想入非非的作品，以抓取另一部份的觀衆。</p>
<p>但是後起的白虹影片公司，能夠認清了本身的使命，毅然的攝製這部具有反帝意義的作品；雖然並不是很成功，但對於這種毅力，我們却應當欽佩的。</p>
<p>「血路」所叙述的是一個失業工人，爲了家庭的負担而去求救於身爲奸商的岳父，被拒；於是無可奈何的挺險爲盜。這裏，說明了失業者的增加，奸商的狠毒，以及社會黑暗面的日益擴大。以後，穿插了一段戀愛故事：就是未婚妻奇突的對他同情，脫離家庭。等他出獄以後，就和他同居。戀愛故事的插入，對於全劇雖不顯得怎麽鬆弛，可是那女子的轉變，有點令人莫明其妙。到結果，那工人加入義勇軍了。戯在一個相當悲壯的場面中告終。</p>
<p>導演者常用那些光線很暗淡的場面。有兩個鏡頭是値得特别提出來的，一個是幾十個工人槓鐵板的「跟攝」，一個是王春元等十幾個工人聚集於一處的「中景」。很有新俄作品的風味。光線閃爍得厲害，無疑的是機械惡劣的緣故。演員當以秦哈哈爲最動人，他破例地扮演窮困的老人，動作和面部都很能感動觀衆的心弦；王春元則祗有動作適合工人的身份，面部表情很不夠。至於女主角錢似鶯，完全是失敗的，無論一哭一笑都不使人感到一點眞切。其他，眼睛一大一小的那個陰險的胖工人，雖然戲並不多，但給觀衆的印象却很深。因之，演員之成績的優劣並不在乎「主角」或「記角」，而要看他能否在所扮的身份下盡他的責任。</p>
<p>簡括的說「血路」自然還是一個很幼稚的作品，無論劇本，導演人，演員，攝影，置景各方面。但是記者爲了鼓勵後起的許多小製作者，因之降低了水準而寫了這篇東西。</p>
<h3>戀愛技術」</h3>
<p>— 評摩爾</p>
<p>Marry　Me</p>
<p>——蘭心映——</p>
<p>美國影片，在中國市塲是佔有「壓倒」的地位。這不但在商業上，就是在觀衆的興趣上也是這樣，因此有許多人對於較冷雋的英國片，覺得不痛快。實在的英國人因爲保守性較重，所以對於電影的各方面，都不會十分「誇飾」。（或則說發展到極度）。</p>
<p>所謂不發展到極度，并不一定在技術方面，卽使對於電影的社會的機能，也不去發展他，（自然主觀上還是有利於他們自已的）。</p>
<p>「戀愛技術，」就是一張典型的英國片。自然，「戀愛技術」是很多歌劇的成份。但是，每一張英國聲片，都有些歌劇的成份的。這是第一點。</p>
<p>第二點，英國片中，常常有一點滑稽加入，而「戀愛技術」，本身是一本喜劇。所以他不一定在演員的表演方面，引人發笑，故事的本身，就是富有趣味性的。</p>
<p>但是，「戀愛技術」，是暴露的，它說少年勞勃脫不愛同事安痕，而愛銀行之女綺娜，因爲他早就想「獲得一富家閨秀，藉以致富」，就是後來「毅然與安痕結褵」，也只因爲安痕一赴勞勃脫寓，司主婦職，一時寓中瑣務，井然有條」。和勞勃脫的兩個弟弟的主張而已。</p>
<p>在現社會中，戀愛本來是鍍金的，但是有人偏要粉飾，說什麽「戀愛是無條件的，至上的，」現在因爲眞相太顯露了，是再也不能紛飾了，所以在「戀愛技術」裏，也反映了出來。他瘊是公開的承認了。</p>
<p>過去看到很多英國片，他的鏡頭，變化得非常少，常常一個正面的中景，一個大寫，一個遠景·其他特寫等，很少用的。就是角度，也差不多，個正面的，一個側的，再一個正面的連到俯瞰斜視也少用的，這種鏡頭，角度，攝歌舞劇是對的·因爲歌舞劇本來很整齊的，至於普通的電影，那首先就要逼眞。於是鏡頭，就非跟着劇中人自由的表演，而變換不可。「戀愛技術」的鏡頭，雖則没有美國變換得多而奇特，（自然不必要的變換是不對的）。但也不像許多英國片的呆板了。</p>
<p>穆蕾在「歡喜緣」中，因爲表演佳妙，而受到廣大的歡迎，就是在和伊密詹寗斯合演的「天之驕子」裏，也有很多不凡的表演。在這裏，他不問在表演痴心狂愛時的少女，或則沉着耐時勞時的少女，都很能把劇中人的心情·藉着神態而給我們知道，我覺得很可稱道的！</p>

<h3>小說電影盛筵難再Dinner　at　Eight（五）</h3>
<p>— 馬騰</p>
<p>奥立佛喬敦因爲喀羅妲范絲要出賣她的股票，就聯想到派卡德來了。派卡德從前不過是位礦師，可是現在有了錢，和財政家總統混在一起了。他今天請他到他的公事房，問他在這種經濟恐慌的時期，倘使遇見必須的時候，願意不願意接濟喬敦公司一下。派卡德表示的是为在乎的神氣。或者他願意的，但是他的話很游移得很。他先要看看股東的名單。倘使喀羅妲的股票賣給他了怎麽辦呢？……倘使他眞的收買足了喬敦公司的股票怎麽辦呢？……喬敦公司的老管事福斯狄克，從他的父親手裏就做起的，極不信任那派卡德。他說！「我不能相信派卡德，如同我不能相信拉住了牛的尾巴，可以把牛捽倒的一樣。」福斯狄克的說是很有見地的，但奥立佛希望着他那見地是錯誤的……在這個青黄不接的當見，他不能不相信一個人呀……他不能不求人家帮助呀……呌他那兒去尋這個人呢？還有今天晚上的宴會。那個言語無味的芬克力夫和他的龑子太太……但喀羅妲一定來的，她還是那樣風趣動人……或者他還可以和她談一下，阻止她的出賣股票……派卡德亦一定來的，用交際的手段，或者可完成一個私交上的友誼……或者派卡德可以帮他的忙接濟他一下。……</p>
<p>在派卡德的家裏，在吉蒂的修妝室裡，吉蒂在鏡子裡看了她的新妝，心裏滿心的快樂。派卡德跑了進來在旁邊說道：「好了。喬敦的股票買過來了，用别人的名字買的。」他一面伸着袖子，一面說道：「我願意出一千塊錢，看看禮拜一開股東會的時候，喬敦跑進了會議室，看見鮑德立治和懷斯東兩個人，每人挾了一大捲的股票，他臉上到底是什麽神氣！」他說完了，手插在衣袋裏，神氣十足地又回他自已的更衣室裡去了。</p>
<p>吉蒂靜坐着不作聲，她獨自沉思着。天下有野心的，本來不是派卡德一個。她亦知道用什麽方法，去取她所需要的東西。她亦和她的丈夫一樣，善於用手段將人家的，據而爲已有。等她丈夫又進來的時候，她很狡滑地說道：「大槪這次喬敦的邀請我們，是最後的一次吧……他要是打聽明白了是你玩的把戲，他怎能不恨你呢？」派卡德聳起了他的鼻子道：「啐，他那裏會知道。這是都安排好的。嚇，我是什麽人！」他又神氣十足地在她房間裡踱來踱去。吉蒂眼睛瞪了他一下說道：「你眞機靈，總有一天坐監牢的！」派卡德滿不在乎似地道：「請我坐監牢，早得很呢。從我在蒙坦那的時候，他們就注意我了。可是我取到了古柏海的，又取得了伊馬的。後來來紐約，他們亦都歸了我的。唬，誰的太太，有帶這麽大的　子的呢？」他看着他夫人柔嫰的玉臂上的金鋼鑽鐲子。（未完）</p>

<h3>Li Songfeng, etc., Hold Smooth Talks at Temple, Conferring with Prince De, etc., for Days, Mutual Opinions Gradually Converging, Mongolian Banner Side Insists on Establishing Autonomous Government, Central Government's Plan Only Permits Establishing Autonomous Committee (Liu Ruiheng Sends Veterinary Experts to Sui)</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Guihua Telegram: Various practical issues regarding Inner Mongolia's autonomy will be discussed in detail after Qin Guichun arrives in Sui. No formal meetings will be held. As soon as Qin telegraphs Sui, Li Songfeng will proceed. After Li Songfeng arrived at Bailing Temple, he has been conferring with Prince De, Prince Yun, and others for days. Both sides' opinions are gradually converging. Huang Zhao and others will set off for Mongolia after Li's report arrives in Sui. They plan to stay at Bailing Temple for a short time. Yun Duanwangchuk has dispatched representatives to Sui on the 3rd to report the conference proceedings to Huang and request urgent instructions. (China-Japan Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Suiyuan Public Telegram: Reports say Huang Shaoxiong convened various princes and representatives to a meeting in Sui. Investigations reveal no formal meeting has been convened. However, any princes and representatives who come to Sui can be received at any time for talks. Li Songfeng is conveying the central government's expectations for Inner Mongolia at Bailing Temple and seeking opinions from various princes and representatives, which are generally compatible. Huang Zhao's current inspection tour in Mongolia aims to treat each other with sincerity. Rumors that the Sui province government sent personnel to accompany the departure are entirely untrue. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the Inner Mongolia issue, since Huang, Zhao, and Li went to Suiyuan and Bailing Temple separately, the main points of negotiation are as follows: On the Mongol princes' side, they insist on establishing a Mongolian autonomous government and returning the original Mongol lands belonging to the Chahar and Suiyuan provinces. Except for diplomacy and military affairs, which will still be handled by the central government, all other political matters will be governed by Mongols, free from central government jurisdiction, resembling the relationship between the British government and Ireland. The central government, while highly supportive of Mongolian autonomy, limits it to the establishment of a Mongolian Autonomous Committee. The committee chair will be selected from among the Mongol princes, or a Border Affairs Ministry will be established within the central government to govern everything, not allowing the establishment of an autonomous government to avoid a situation of division. As a result, both sides are currently engaging in repeated discussions. Therefore, Huang and Zhao's entry into Mongolia is difficult to determine before the aforementioned issues are resolved. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a certain source, Huang Shaoxiong believes that many Mongol princes have left Bailing Temple. He intends to halt his trip and dispatch Li Songfeng and others to exchange views with Prince De on Inner Mongolian autonomy. Huang does not quite agree with the Inner Mongolian organization of an autonomous government, hoping to organize a committee, which he can support to the best of his ability. However, regarding overall issues, it is still necessary to confer with Yan. He intends to visit Hebian Village in person if necessary. Huang previously telegraphed Qin Dechun to Sui, seeking Song's opinion on Inner Mongolian autonomy. Song stated that he would fully comply with the central government's intentions, hoping to proceed according to the central government's established overall principles. Qin originally planned to go to Sui that day but decided to postpone his trip to Suiyuan due to personal affairs and telegraphed Huang to report. As for the central government's plan to send Bai Yunti to Mongolia, Bai plans to go north soon due to many difficulties ahead. After Enhebat arrived in Ping from Beijing, he inquired about the situation of Inner Mongolian autonomy for days. Enhe said to people, "The Mongolian affairs will be resolved by the central government, and I personally should not express opinions, nor will I go to Mongolia." (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Panchen Lama's representative, Xia Ciren Kanbu, met with Huang Zhao. The result was satisfactory. He returned to Bailing Temple to report on the morning of the 3rd. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Huang Shaoxiong and Zhao Pilian have arrived in Suiyuan. Wang Xianqiang, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, said that after Huang and others went north, they originally intended to allow and guide Inner Mongolian autonomy under the principle of not harming the country's administrative governance, establishing a local political committee in Mongolia to handle general administration. Other foreign affairs and military affairs are all controlled by the central government. The demands recently raised by Prince De and others do not conform to the central government's original plan, so Huang and others are temporarily staying in Suiyuan. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Huang Shaoxiong, Minister of the Interior, telegraphed Liu Ruiheng, Director of the Department of Health, requesting the selection and dispatch of veterinary experts to the Sui-Mongolia area to investigate and study animal epidemics. The province has experienced severe animal epidemics in recent years, with an extraordinarily high number of livestock deaths, causing significant losses to the Mongolian people, etc. Liu has already telegraphed Chen Zongzhi, Director of the Beiping Central Epidemic Prevention Office, ordering him to lead several veterinary experts to Sui immediately to begin investigating, studying, and preventing epidemics.

<h3>Liu and Tang Armies Engage in Tug-of-War Warfare, Which Has Not Yet Ceased</h3>
<p>(Beiping) After the conflict between the Liu and Tang armies in eastern Chahar, the two sides have engaged in a tug-of-war in recent days. Tang's army initially led troops south from Dushikou but was intercepted by Liu's army. Taking them by surprise, Liu's army annihilated most of Tang's troops who reached Yunzhou, seizing a large number of Tang's firearms and horses. After suffering this setback, Tang's army reorganized and launched a fierce attack south on the 2nd of this month. Liu's army could not withstand it and retreated step by step. On the same day, Tang's army approached Chicheng. Liu had no choice but to send his family members residing in the city to Longguan. From the 3rd, Liu's army began to counterattack. Tang's army retreated to the area north of Yunzhou on the afternoon of the 3rd. The two armies are still fighting fiercely in the area. (4th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Regarding the issue of Sun's troops in Xiguan, the Ping authorities said the Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai provinces mostly expressed opposition. It is also not easy to move out in this severe winter. The troops can temporarily station in the area east of Pingluo County in Ningxia and west of Baotou in Suiyuan, and then continue to move out after next spring. They have telegraphed the central government for instructions and telegraphed Huang Shaoxiong to consult with Yan on the method of leaving Sun's army temporarily stationed at the junction of Ningxia and Suiyuan provinces. It is reported that the Ningxia authorities have expressed opposition because Pingluo is less than 100 li from the provincial capital. Sun's representative, Hu Jie, went to Ganzhou within three days to meet Jiang to ask for all Qinghai dispatched Han Brigade Commander Qigong, Ma Regiment Commander Bu Luan, leading troops from Ganzhou to Ningxia added defense, has reached the destination, the remaining troops, continue to set off from Qinghai, co-maintain the overall situation in the Northwest.

<h3>Yin Tong Proceeds with Negotiations on Opening the Ping-Shen Railway, Conducts Written Consultations with Arima, Dispatches Personnel to Shenyang to Meet with Kan Duo, Both Sides Will Negotiate at Yuguan, Ping-Shen Joint Transport Scheduled to Be Implemented at the End of This Month</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The issue of the Beiping-Shenyang railway opening has become concrete. The Beiping-Ning Railway Bureau has dispatched personnel to Shenyang to contact the pseudo-bureau chief, Kan Duo, regarding transport affairs outside the pass. According to Bureau Chief Yin Tong, there are two principles for opening the Ping-Shen railway: (1) Reject vehicles with the words "Fengshan Railway" from entering the pass; (2) Do not exchange official documents or accounts with the pseudo-railway. Yin will visit Chiba in Ping on the evening of the 4th for further contact, which can be implemented in the coming days. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Tong is actively proceeding with the joint transport between the Beiping-Ning and Fengshan railways. He has dispatched Su Yuqi to contact the Kwantung Army. Joint selection is scheduled to be implemented at the end of this month. Detailed methods will be discussed at a meeting in Shanhaiguan. Yin sent a letter to Japanese Envoy Arima last night to consult on this issue. Arima has not yet expressed his opinion. The Ministry of Railways has also dispatched a special commissioner, Tan Yaozong, to Ping to assist Yin Tong in handling everything. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Tong arrived in Ping from Tianjin tonight to talk. The Ping-Shen railway opening matter has not yet been contacted. The rumor that there is a definite method is not accurate. As for my dispatch of personnel to Shenyang, this is also not the case. Coming to Ping, I plan to stay for a day or two and return to Tianjin. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Bandits in Funing Falsely Surrender, Cause Trouble Out of Town at Night, Attempting to Break Through the Security Team's Defense Line, Zhang Xiguang Orders a Fierce Attack, Lao Haozi Sends Chief of Staff to Show Sincerity, Intending to Buy Time</h3>
<p>Changli: Bandits in Funing paid a visit to Zhang Xiguang on the 4th, expressing their willingness to surrender their arms. We had long guarded against their trick to buy time, so after nightfall, we strictly ordered all teams to take proper precautions. Sure enough, at about 9:00 p.m., 600 bandits burst out of the south gate, attempting to break through our defense line. We were discovered. Zhang Xiguang immediately ordered all teams to launch a fierce attack. Countless bandits were killed in the area near the south gate. As of the time of the telegram, the front line was still in intense battle. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Changli: The bandits in Funing were pushed to a dead end. On the 4th, Lao Haozi sent his chief of staff out of the city to visit Zhang Xiguang, the commander-in-chief of the suppression of bandits, expressing that he had made a determination on the issue of surrendering arms, only hoping that the authorities would ensure the safety of the bandits' lives. Zhang said that if the bandits could accept the provincial government's generous proposal and automatically surrender their arms, the suppression could be stopped. Therefore, the two sides decided to make a final decision on the morning of the 5th. On the morning of the 4th, there was silence. Zhang Xiguang feared that the bandits' attitude might change halfway, and strictly ordered all teams to strengthen their defenses. If the bandits resolutely surrender their arms on the morning of the 5th, the issue of Ludong can be brought to an end. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Security Team in Funing launched a general attack on the bandits inside the city yesterday. The battle outside the east and south gates was extremely fierce. The bandits inside the city, because the north gate could be freely entered and exited, were prepared to flee to that area. The heavy firearms that the security team had previously received from the provincial government, a total of six armored vehicles, have been unloaded at the Garrison Camp and transported to the front line, which is expected to arrive today. Zhang Xiguang, the commander-in-chief of bandit suppression, is currently directing the fighting from the front. (4th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Yellow Paper Painstakingly Refutes Pro-Japanese Remarks</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Yellow Paper issued by the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is edited in Western languages and describes the true facts of diplomacy. It is sent to foreign countries for reference by people from all over the world. Its ninth issue was published on the 4th, painstakingly refuting the remarks of the pro-Japanese scholar Fan Fulei. The reason is that Fan wrote a book called "The Legal Recognition of the Manchurian Regime and the Nine-Power Treaty," which was published in Paris last year, stating that the establishment of the pseudo-state was an independent movement by the people's automation, and that Japan's recognition of "Manchukuo" did not violate the Nine-Power Treaty's whitewash and was absurd. The German jurist Aichi Gara wrote an article to refute it. The Information Department printed the paper into the ninth issue of the Yellow Paper, prefixed with a preface, so that the world can understand the truth and not be confused by Fan's remarks.

<h3>Three Important Issues in the Constitution: The Production of the President of the Executive Yuan, The Limits of Local Government's Authority, The Rights and Obligations of the People</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Just as the first draft of the Constitution was about to be reviewed, three research questions suddenly arose: (1) The generation of the President of the Executive Yuan, some advocated following the legacy of the Prime Minister, that the President of the Executive Yuan be appointed by the President to the National Government, and some believed that this method made the President's powers seem too great, and advocated that the President of the Executive Yuan be elected by the National Assembly. (2) The regulations on the powers of the central government and local governments, some advocated that the powers of the provincial government should be reduced, only acting as a liaison between the central government and the county government, and the powers of the county government should be increased to produce the effect of basic construction. Secondly, regarding the election of the governor of the province, some advocated the stipulation of candidate measures. (3) The rights and obligations of the people, some advocated that the original regulations of the first draft of the Constitution should still be maintained, and some advocated that the scope should be expanded. It is heard that regarding the third point, after detailed research, President Sun decided to postpone the review time because it is planned to adjourn the meeting for a week next week, until the 16th of this month, before the third reading and review can be submitted to the Constitutional Assembly for discussion.

<h3>Pay Attention to Post-Suppression Work When Suppressing the Bandits in Ludong</h3>
<p>— Shi</p>
<p>Since the Tanggu Accord was established, the crisis has gradually eased. However, there are still many thorns ahead. Post-disaster work is not easy. The dispersal and loss of the passionate youths from the four provinces due to patriotism are minor matters. Since 4.3 million square miles of land has fallen into foreign hands, customs duties have decreased by 20 million yuan per year. The people who were invisibly imported into the Shandong and Hebei provinces from the northeast have also been cut off. Furthermore, in counties like Ludong, agriculture is not very fertile and industry is not fully developed. The reason they are more prosperous than the counties in northern Hebei is the invisible imports from the three northeastern provinces. Recently, the situation has changed drastically. Not only has this kind of invisible import disappeared, but also large numbers of refugees from outside the pass have poured in. In addition, the enemy and puppet bandits have been ravaged or alienated and provoked, creating trouble for no reason. Therefore, entanglements are emerging and handling them is thorny.</p>
<p>The various counties of Ludong, while Sino-Japanese disputes are unresolved, are regions with significant risks in general political relations. Li Jichun's troops have just been reorganized and the dispute has come to an end. The Lao Haozi gang has risen again, which seems to be a minor ailment and unrelated to the overall situation. However, upon careful examination, its reality is complex and contains future crises. If there are no thorough solutions, it is feared that future troubles will be left behind. Lao Haozi and others were originally part of the Northeast Volunteer Army, raising their arms against Japan. Later, because the Volunteer Army retreated westward or went into hiding on the spot, the overall strategy has changed. Therefore, some people inevitably defected and were taken advantage of by the enemy, and even provided with weapons and ammunition, and assisted with funds. This situation is very dangerous. Moreover, all parts of Jidong have repeatedly suffered from war disasters and the people are still in dire straits. The Japanese army within Hebei is still staying and has not withdrawn. Most social mentalities are still uneasy. As for Liu Guitang, Tang Yulin, and other troops, they are still stationed inside Dushikou and the Chicheng area. Without concrete resettlement methods, or if the handling is accidentally inappropriate, it will easily provoke latent crises, and the localities will again be ravaged.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the provinces and regions in the Yellow River Basin were civilized earlier in our country, but they are still stuck in an agricultural economy. The hub of commercial development is in trade with Mongolia and doing business with the three northeastern provinces. This is the case for Shanxi commerce, and it is also the case for Tianjin merchants. However, since Outer Mongolia seceded and the northeast was lost, the road to business has been blocked. The world economic panic has struck, and militarism has been forced into it. Commercial capital, which only engages in transshipment, has had to painfully sacrifice it. Agricultural management in our country has already exhausted its greatest ability in manual labor to engage in cultivation. However, over the past thousands of years, the land has been completely depleted of its power. If artificial fertilization is not added in the future, it will be difficult to hope for an increase in production. We try to observe the provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, and Henan in detail. More than 90% of the cultivated land currently cultivated has been withered. The phosphorus and other vitality contained in the land are gradually lacking. The depletion can be known without waiting for chemical analysis. Looking again at the residents of the Yellow River Basin, most of them show signs of hunger. Only one or two out of a hundred can truly have enough food and a little surplus strength. Since farming cannot make up for the current urgent needs and the land is becoming increasingly depleted, if no method is devised to provide relief, and hoping that they will be able to regenerate with their own strength, I am afraid there will be no day for it.</p>
<p>Therefore, the plan for today cannot only seek temporary peace in upper-level politics, but should, in a negative aspect, first resolve all political contradictions, so that the existing troops can become national troops and not hinder the upward development of productive undertakings. If it can turn soldiers into workers and relocate them to the border, it will be transformed from pure consumption to production. This can be a benefit for ten years in political terms, and economic development can also be slightly developed. Taking a further step to plan large-scale intensive agricultural management, the provinces of Hebei and Shandong may be able to get some help. In a positive aspect, we must pay attention to the development of the cotton and wool industries. Our country has abundant raw materials and a wide consumer market. We only need to be able to use scientific methods and apply artificial fertilizers to cultivate the soil, and it will not be difficult to gradually prosper the agriculture of the northern provinces. The people will be able to settle down in their business, and the economy will also be able to develop upwards. Once the root of the disturbance is settled, it will be able to generate resistance to the outside world.</p>
<h3>Litvinov Breaks Through the Waves Westward: US-Soviet Negotiations to Begin on Tuesday, Focusing More on Politics Than Economics; Naval Cooperation Between the Two Countries Under Preparation</h3>
<p>(Washington) Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov is about to arrive in the United States. It is reported that the conversation between the US President and Litvinov next Tuesday will focus on international political issues, with particular attention paid to the situation in the Far East. The US President's determination to communicate with the Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union, Kalinin, is mainly due to political rather than economic reasons. It is said that since the beginning of October, the US government has repeatedly received reports from its officials stationed in Manchuria, all indicating that Russo-Japanese relations have entered a pessimistic state. It is widely believed that if diplomatic relations between Russia and the United States are restored, friendly relations between the navies of the two countries will inevitably follow. Therefore, the improvement of relations between Russia and the United States will have a significant impact on the military value of the Russian naval base in Vladivostok. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<h3>US Fleet to Return to the Atlantic Next Year: Japan as if Taking a Cooling Medicine</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt has approved the withdrawal of the US fleet to the Atlantic within 1934. According to the Under Secretary of the Navy, the issue of the fleet sailing out of the Pacific is currently under serious consideration. The reason why the US Navy needs to cruise the Atlantic is simply to familiarize the fleet with the conditions of both oceans. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) US Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Standley, stated today that the US battle fleet and patrol force will cruise the Atlantic next summer. The exercises ordered by the previous president will also be held in the Atlantic. This move will cause the majority of the battle fleet usually stationed in the Pacific to also sail to the Atlantic, but the Pacific Special Squadron and the Asiatic Fleet will not be affected. In addition, several battleships currently undergoing major repairs will remain in the Pacific. It is possible that the battle fleet will return to the Pacific in the fall, while the patrol force will remain at its original base in the Atlantic. At the same time, it was announced that all naval aviation units stationed on the Pacific coast will remain in place and will not participate in the patrol. According to this patrol plan, the details have not yet been finalized. According to the opinions of some naval officers, it is expected that both the battle fleet and the patrol fleet will return to the Pacific in the fall, as all supply systems are already established on the Pacific coast, and relocation would be costly. It is also reported that a plan is currently being drafted to have at least nine battleships, five aircraft carriers, seven heavy cruisers, seven light cruisers, fifty destroyers, and sixteen auxiliary vessels sail through the Panama Canal into the Atlantic next spring. If aircraft carriers join the exercises, some of the aircraft stationed in the West may be transferred to the East, or a portion of the aircraft stationed on the Atlantic coast may be allocated for the use of the seven aircraft carriers. At that time, five battleships, three cruisers, and fifteen destroyers will remain in the Pacific. These warships are currently undergoing major repairs. Some people believe that this patrol plan to the Atlantic has political implications, but others say that merchants on the Atlantic coast hope for the return of warships to the Atlantic coast in order to increase trade. It should be noted that the US battle fleet sailed to the Pacific for exercises a year and a half ago, and the Atlantic patrol force also followed suit and has remained there ever since. However, there has been no announcement of the patrol fleet being stationed in the Pacific. As for Japan, its anxiety over the concentration of US warships in the Pacific has not diminished in the past year. (National News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The news of the US fleet withdrawing to the Atlantic is quite welcome in political circles here, and is seen as a sign of everything returning to normal. Today, according to a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the concentration of the US fleet in the Pacific for two years has created an abnormal situation and aroused Japan's intense public opinion. Although official circles have not yet received this news, it has already created a good impression on Japan. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the news of the US Navy's decision to withdraw its fleet to the Atlantic came out, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs made an informal statement on the 4th, saying that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not yet received this official telegram. The intention of the US fleet's concentration in the Pacific was to prepare for the sudden changes in the situation in the Far East after the Shanghai Incident. However, as a result, it extremely stimulated Japanese public opinion and created a tense atmosphere in Japan-US relations that was on the verge of breaking out. In the future, the withdrawal of the entire US fleet to the Atlantic, regardless of the reason, certainly represents a concrete event of the United States easing its feelings towards Japan. The suggestion that the purpose of the US fleet's relocation to the Atlantic is to counter the countries of continental Europe does not seem to be true. Officials from the Ministry of the Navy also said that they had heard that the US fleet would withdraw to the Atlantic next spring and return to the Pacific in the autumn. However, the Ministry of the Navy had not received an official announcement. The deployment of the US Navy should be decided by the United States itself, and its temporary actions should not be criticized casually. (Nichi-Ren News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The US Navy authorities have stated that the entire navy will return to its original defense areas next summer. The Japanese side observes the following: (1) The reason for the US Navy's return to its original defense areas is that the situation in the Far East has eased slightly, and there is no need to stay in the Pacific for a long time. (2) The naval bases and facilities along the Pacific coast have not been completed. (3) As a result of the Japanese Five-Minister Conference, the principled faction did not win a complete victory, and the domestic peace ideology gradually increased its influence. This statement by the United States has a significant impact on Japan domestically. (Hua-Lian News Agency, 4th)</p>

<h3>Japan's Drug Crisis, Northeast China Issue: Situation Changes at League of Nations Conference; British Representative Accommodates the Status Quo and Proposes Amendment, Passed by the Assembly with Enthusiastic Support from Japanese Representative</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Advisory Committee continued to discuss the opium issue this afternoon, and the situation has changed. Sir John ডেvenham, the British representative to the Geneva International Opium Conference, proposed an amendment, which was enthusiastically supported by the Japanese representative Yokoyama and passed unanimously by the Assembly. Sir John ডেvenham proposed adding the following to the report: "The former Manchurian administrators had used opium production and taxation schemes to generate huge revenues. The new administrators seem to want to establish a monopoly to increase tax revenues. Recent information received about opium causes great anxiety, because the new situation will not only expand drug abuse locally, but will also endanger other countries. The committee has noted the establishment of secret factories in the Far East and other places, where large quantities of opium are available for use, and Manchuria will also face the same danger. Because the League of Nations Council has not recognized the new Manchurian administrators, it has not received reports and other information from the parts stipulated in the convention. Therefore, the committee feels that it should take the most appropriate method for the current situation to meet the needs of the Council, so as to seek detailed information on the production, sale, and use of drugs in Manchuria, and handle everything in the same way as receiving reports from other countries. The current administrators of Manchuria should know that their opium policy has a great impact on other countries and should know that it is now necessary to cooperate in implementing all the restrictions that other countries have agreed to abide by. This is crucial and cannot be ignored." The Belgian representative accepted ডেvenham's amendment and proposed adding the following paragraph: "At present, we would like to ask opium exporting countries to pay attention to all applications for opium and narcotics to these places, and it is necessary to implement extremely strict management." The Italian representative proposed voting on the text proposed by the Belgian representative, but it was rejected by the assembly with nine votes against six. Therefore, ডেvenham's amendment was passed unanimously. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Since the opening of the League of Nations Opium Advisory Committee, people in the League of Nations have been discussing whether the widespread planting of poppies in Manchuria will lead to the possibility of the powerful countries de facto recognizing the puppet organization. Because Japan has not signed the international convention on the control of drugs, and "Manchukuo" is not bound by any international agreements, all committee members believe that it is very difficult to collect opium statistics from Manchuria. Therefore, the committee has suggested that the League of Nations Council find a way to obtain a complete report on the production and sale of opium in Manchuria. Although the committee stated that its only purpose is to reduce the opium trade and that it has never put the international political situation in its mind, the League of Nations representatives immediately saw that this suggestion had the possibility of tending towards de facto recognition, because there is no other way to obtain the necessary statistics. Moreover, in the current situation, Manchuria has created an opium monopoly and is also planting opium extensively, which will inevitably cause endless harm. Therefore, the committee stated in its suggestion that this uncontrolled and unreported opium harvest will easily become a threat to the world. (National News Agency, 3rd)</p>

<h3>Britain Pays Attention to the Situation in the Far East: Debate Scheduled for Wednesday in the House of Lords, Involving the Issue of the Chinese Communist Party; Song Ziwen's Resignation Generally Seen as a Victory for the Pro-Japanese Faction; Rumors of Russia's Peaceful Resolution of the Sino-Eastern Railway Dispute with Japan</h3>
<p>(London) Lord Peel will propose a debate in the House of Lords next Wednesday on Britain's active and constructive policies in the Far East. The general public will pay special attention to this debate. In the past few days, the British public has been slightly more optimistic about events in the Far East, because events in the Far East are related to the world. A certain reporter even asked about the current state of no recriminations between China and Japan, so the public attaches great importance to it. The withdrawal of Japanese troops from the demilitarized zone of North China to outside the Great Wall is seen as a gesture of goodwill from Japan to China. Some people also say that this move by Japan is the first step in a future conflict between Russia and Japan. However, the Central Committee of the Communist Party in Moscow recently passed a resolution advocating a peaceful resolution of the Sino-Eastern Railway dispute and preparing to hold a meeting in Tokyo based on the outline recently expressed by Japanese Minister of War Araki to peacefully resolve various issues in the Far East. In view of this, the claim that a conflict between Russia and Japan is about to occur seems not to be fully believed. London has received news that negotiations between China and Japan in Beiping have made good progress. In view of this, people here regard Song Ziwen's resignation as Minister of Finance as a victory for those who oppose reliance on the League of Nations and advocate a pro-Japanese policy. The public fears that the debate in the House of Lords next Wednesday will involve the harm of the Chinese Communist Party. Well-informed sources are not without concern about the delay in the suppression of the communists, but they also commend the Chinese government's efforts to reorganize the economy and other matters. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>(London) Parliament, which has been in recess for fourteen weeks, is scheduled to reconvene on November 7th. The most noteworthy point on its agenda will be the unemployment insurance bill. The government plans to place those who have exhausted their insurance benefits and those who are receiving relief under a centralized management system. This plan will inevitably generate many debates. Various parties have criticized the government's disarmament policy and Britain's responsibilities under the Locarno Treaty. The government is now urgently trying to cope with this. Parliament will have a debate on this matter next Tuesday. Foreign Secretary Simon will be the first to bear the brunt. Labor peer members will also raise the same issue on Wednesday after debating the India issue. The events that Parliament will debate include talks on British-American war debts, the British-Russian trade agreement, the prospects for the resumption of the World Economic Conference, and legislation on lotteries and gambling.

<h3>The So-Called Araki-Style Outline for a Peace Conference Aims to Recognize Japan's Policy of Aggression Against China; The Military Proposes an Agenda Divided into Seven Major Items</h3>
<p>Hua-Lian News Agency Tokyo Correspondence According to the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun, Minister of War Araki, in order to cope with the crisis of 1936, has decided to propose to the government to promote the East Asian Peace Conference. Minister of War Araki's proposal is as follows: (1) The time should be before the Second London Conference in 1935. (2) The meeting place is set in Tokyo. (3) Japan is the initiator and sends invitations to East Asian countries. (4) The participating countries are Japan, the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom, India, France, the Netherlands, Manchukuo, and others. (5) The purpose of the meeting is to determine East Asian peace, liquidate all past disputes, and determine the outline of East Asian peace work. (6) Scope of discussion: (1) "Recognition of Manchukuo" The purpose of Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations is to enable all countries to recognize the independence of Manchukuo. Recognition of Manchukuo is a basic condition for peace in the Far East. This conference should allow Manchukuo to participate. The issue of Manchukuo's recognition must be resolved at this conference, so Manchukuo's participation is an absolute condition. (2) "Naval Treaty Issue" The purpose of this conference is to liquidate various treaties in East Asia. The preparatory conditions for the Washington and London conferences must be decided at this conference. (3) "Kellogg-Briand Pact and Nine-Power Treaty" Since the Manchurian Incident, these two treaties have been the object of dispute between the two sides. This conference must revise new treaties in accordance with the new situation in East Asia. (4) "Japanese-Russian Non-Aggression Treaty" This conference is convened to resolve future international relations. Therefore, the Japanese-Russian non-aggression treaty must first resolve all the root causes of disputes between the two countries, such as the Sino-Eastern Railway and the Japanese-Russian fishery issue, which should also be resolved in connection with this issue. (5) "China Issue" The East Asian Peace Conference should examine the China issue, based on the Shanghai and North China cease-fire agreements, resolve all disputes, and simultaneously resolve issues such as commercial treaties, tariff issues, extraterritorial rights, and all outstanding issues. It should take Sino-Japanese friendship as the basis and determine East Asian peace work. (6) "India Issue" The economic problems between Japan and India must be fundamentally resolved. (7) "League of Nations Issue" If the issue of recognizing Manchukuo is resolved, then Japan's issue with the League of Nations will also be resolved naturally. Minister of War Araki is scheduled to return to Tokyo at the end of the month and consult with Minister of the Navy Osumi, and then make a suggestion to the government.</p>
<h3>Japanese Zaibatsu Urge Hirota to Proceed with Peaceful Diplomacy Towards Russia, Starting with Economic Cooperation Between the Two Countries</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) After the foreign policy stated by Foreign Minister Hirota at the Five-Minister Conference was unanimously supported by the various zaibatsu, the pro-war faction of the military is actively creating a new political situation, while the zaibatsu and political parties are urging Foreign Minister Hirota to carry out the so-called peaceful diplomacy. News of the rapprochement between the United States and Russia has reached Japan, and the peace faction is becoming more anxious. It is reported that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry have held several secret meetings to first break through the deadlock in diplomacy with Russia and promote trade between the two countries. It is said that the basic policies of the two ministries on Russia are as follows: (1) After the September 18th Incident, Japan and Russia faced each other in northern Manchuria. The Sino-Eastern Railway sales conference further worsened relations between the two countries. Anyone who wants to promote trade between the two countries must first sweep away the dark clouds between the two countries, that is, first negotiate the border with Russia. (2) Organize a Soviet economic inspection team to communicate the feelings between the two countries and contact the approach methods of commerce, industry, and trade. (3) The revitalization of trade with Russia cannot rely on the loss compensation system, but must take active methods, so making credit lending stable is a prerequisite. Expand the content of the 1925 Japanese-Russian agreement and newly conclude a commercial treaty between the two countries based on the principle of reciprocity. (Hua-Lian News Agency, 4th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Naval District Adds Garrison Fleet; New Destroyer Hatsushimo Re-Launched</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The naval authorities have decided to establish a new commander to command and supervise the warships and other maritime units under the jurisdiction of the commander of the naval district in preparation for 1935-36. The contents are as follows: (1) New garrison fleets will be established at the Yokosuka, Kure, and Sasebo naval districts. Under the commander of the naval district, a new rear admiral-level garrison fleet commander will be established. (2) The garrison fleet will be composed of warships belonging to the naval district, except for ships attached to other fleets that are in the naval district and the second and third reserve ships. Active ships that are not attached to other fleets, third reserve ships whose crew members have not been reduced by half, and ships that can still be deployed at sea even if their crew members have been reduced by half will be organized. A new rear admiral-level commander will be established and commanded by the commander of the naval district. (3) A chief of staff and a director of the department will be placed under the garrison fleet commander, with the aim of preventing the reduction of the combat power of the warships and maritime units belonging to the naval district. (Dentsu News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The new sharp destroyer Hatsushimo, which failed to launch when it was launched at the Uraga Dock on the 31st due to an obstruction, was repaired and the dock was repaired, and the re-launching ceremony was held again at 4:00 pm today. It has been ascertained that the cause of the failure was that one section of the pitch pine used for the most important friction surface remained, which became an unexpected obstacle. (Dentsu News Agency, 4th)</p>
<h3>Saito Decides to Convene an Internal Affairs Conference; Araki Believes the Rural Problem is Serious</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Some cabinet members lack enthusiasm for the issue of establishing internal affairs national policy proposed by Prime Minister Saito, especially Minister of Internal Affairs Yamamoto, who still has doubts about the effectiveness of various national policies. Therefore, the prime minister has not dared to actively promote it. However, the military and Minister of War Araki advocate urgently establishing internal affairs national policy and have expressed dissatisfaction with the prime minister's passive attitude. As a result of considering the matter, Prime Minister Saito decided to convene a meeting of relevant cabinet members to discuss the issue. The prime minister will seek the opinions of various cabinet members at the cabinet meeting on the 7th and then decide on the review policy. The first issue of the internal affairs national policy is the most important rural problem, which is related to Prime Minister Saito, Minister of Internal Affairs Yamamoto, Minister of Agriculture Goto, Minister of Commerce Nakajima, and Minister of Colonial Affairs Nagai. However, Takahashi, who is most deeply involved, cannot attend the meeting because he is busy reviewing the budget. However, as the meeting progresses, the prime minister or Director General Horikiri will take contact to proceed with the review. (Nichi-Ren News Agency)</p>
<h3>India-Japan Conference Stalls</h3>
<p>Delhi Negotiations between Japan and India have stalled because the issue of the import volume of Japanese cotton cloth cannot be resolved. As of the 3rd, the Japanese government's reply has not yet arrived here, so the conference has not made any progress. Since the conference on the 30th, the two sides have completely stopped negotiations and are waiting for the Japanese government's reply in a tense atmosphere. The Japanese delegation received a telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the Osaka government-private cooperative council on the morning of the 3rd. The government representatives immediately convened a meeting to discuss countermeasures. The India-Japan trade treaty will expire in a week. Unless there is a sudden and drastic resolution in the future, it seems difficult to hope for the success of the conference before the expiration date. (Nichi-Ren News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<h3>European Countries Compete to Expand Armaments; France Recruits Black Troops as Vanguard; Britain Adds Twelve New Fighter Planes; Switzerland Increases Defense Spending to Prepare for Germany</h3>
<p>(Paris) The French military authorities are now planning to recruit black troops in the Morocco region and transport them to France to take charge of security affairs in various places. The French General Staff is currently studying the feasibility of this plan, and General Haugou, the Inspector General of the French Army, has also gone to Morocco to study it on the spot. It is said that France is now facing a decrease in the birth rate and fears that the number of new recruits who can be called up in five years will decrease day by day. Therefore, the French government and the General Staff are actively preparing methods to supplement the army. The French Ministry of the Army plans to recruit 5,000 black troops from North Africa in 1934. Currently, it has not yet obtained the consent of all parties, so it has not been decided. Those who oppose this plan, such as General Li Onandre, deeply believe that these black people are prone to developing the habit of alcoholism or even becoming communist once they leave their natural environment. Therefore, Li Onandre and others advocate that these black troops should only be used in wartime. (National News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) According to the Daily Herald, the Ministry of Aviation has ordered twelve single-seat fighter planes with a speed of over 190 miles per hour and can climb to 16,000 feet. These new planes are intended to thicken the defenses of London and its surroundings. (National News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland Recent rumors have claimed that if Germany and France were to engage in war again in the future, Germany would pass through Switzerland to enter France. Since this news came out, the Swiss government has been very wary. It was reported some time ago that the Swiss government planned to request funds from the parliament to consolidate the defensive works on the German-Swiss border. Recently, it was heard that the Swiss cabinet had requested 82 million francs from the parliament in order to supplement military equipment and army uniforms. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Brussels The Belgian government's budget proposal for 1934 recommends that defense expenditures be set at 869,356,000 francs. This money will be used to manufacture armaments, expand the wharves and docks of Bruges, and add machinery to make production meet the demands of mobilization. One of the government's plans is to authorize the Belgian King to implement certain plans during wartime to protect civilians. (National News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<h3>British Undersecretary Defends the Locarno Treaty, Calling it a Powerful Tool for Peace in Western Europe</h3>
<p>(London) British Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs Eden said in a speech in Skipton, Yorkshire today that the Locarno Treaty is the most effective tool for peace in Western Europe. Unfortunately, some people are now campaigning against it. Resolutions made under the Locarno Treaty must be made by the League of Nations Council, and the votes of the League of Nations Council must be unanimous. Therefore, since Britain is a permanent director of the Council, a vote cannot be passed without British consent. But there is one exception: if Britain encounters a breach of the undertaking not to go to war or an invasion of the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland, it must provide assistance to the injured party. But even if Britain encounters such a situation, it is still the sole judge of whether this obligation is applicable. The Locarno Treaty does not contain clauses allowing contracting states to withdraw from the alliance. If Britain withdraws, Britain will be more likely to be drawn into European wars than when the Locarno Treaty exists. We must know that the policy of isolation is a foolish policy. Germany's withdrawal from the disarmament conference has made the situation more difficult, but disarmament work must still proceed. Britain is determined to avoid an arms race. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Hurricane Sweeps Cuba, Political Activities Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>Havana Since the Cuban political parties began their revolution, today there has been a third major hurricane sweeping the country, causing agitators, bomb throwers, and conspirators to hide in their homes, temporarily suspending political activities. This hurricane passed through eastern Cuba this morning. The wind in the capital is not very strong, but the disaster in the provinces is quite severe. Nineteen people have already died in Oriente province alone, and the loss of property is enormous. Several sugar-producing areas have also suffered heavy losses. At that time, violent winds and heavy rain came together. Many city streets were flooded, and the movement to overthrow the government in the capital was temporarily suspended.

<h3>U.S. Willing to Cooperate with Britain and France to Maintain Financial Stability; Reiterates No Intention to Cause a Currency War; Foreign Gold Purchase Plan Underway; Quantity and Price Kept Secret</h3>
<p>(Washington) U.S. government officials today denied any intention to undermine world financial stability, saying they will use cooperative methods to maintain it. Although the New York Federal Reserve Bank has full discretion to purchase any amount of gold at any price abroad, it will still cooperate with the Bank of England and the Bank of France to achieve financial stability. This cooperation can be expanded to include commercial banks in both countries. The foreign gold purchase plan is already underway. As for the exact amount and price, the Financial Reconstruction Corporation has changed its initial plan to keep it secret and not disclose it. However, the U.S. government has made it clear that it has no intention of causing a currency war, and some of the president's advisors have always advocated sound money, so the market's fears have been somewhat relieved. Now, there is an expectation that the price of the gold dollar will gradually depreciate abroad to reach the desired level. (National News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) The United States is keeping the purchase of gold abroad strictly secret for two reasons: first, to avoid other countries being drawn into a currency war; and second, to keep speculators from knowing the truth. The U.S. decision not to announce the daily gold purchase price naturally has other reasons. The U.S. authorities do not want to explicitly show outsiders what they are doing. Furthermore, observing various phenomena, in addition to raising the price of gold, the U.S. authorities at least want to stabilize the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar, the British pound, and the French franc, but do not want to make this exchange rate fixed. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) British financial journalists have expressed both sympathy and criticism regarding the U.S. gold policy. Several newspapers today discussed the impact of U.S. gold purchases, saying that the position of gold standard countries will be harmed. General public opinion mostly believes that the United States is now adopting extremely abnormal and invasive methods to lower the value of the U.S. dollar. However, the Daily Mail and other newspapers believe that U.S. gold purchases in Europe will not cause panic, and all talk of war and retaliation are mere rumors. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Anglo-American Negotiations Fail to Agree on Permanent War Debt Arrangement; Future Talks in Washington Can Only Seek Understanding on Payments Due</h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, British sources here stated that the British representative, Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, was very disappointed that the Anglo-American war debt conference had broken down on the issue of negotiating a permanent agreement and is now preparing to return home, leaving the negotiations for the December payment to others. The proposals that led to the failure of the conference are currently being kept secret. Today, only Undersecretary of the Treasury Acheson claimed that efforts to discuss a permanent solution have been abandoned, and future talks will focus on understanding regarding the debt due in December. At this time, the silver advocates generally advocate that next month's payment should still be made in accordance with the previous method, paying a certain amount of silver to show credit and debt. However, legal experts say that the U.S. President's authority to accept silver will expire before mid-November. If Britain does not pay early, this method will be difficult to consider. Some officials believe that Britain will use some method to pay a certain amount to show good faith, and the United States is expected to accept whatever method the British offer. Although no detailed information was released on the previous negotiations, it is said that even if Britain had a concrete proposal, it would not be announced at this time, because before the conference began, it was widely rumored that the British representative would ask for a 90% reduction in the total debt, and the U.S. government also made it clear that such debt reduction would be rejected by Congress. The actual talks between the U.S. Treasury Secretary and the British representative have been few and short, often lasting only half an hour. Three days ago, the U.S. President personally met with the British representative. The details of the talks at that time were not released. It is now believed that the meeting was very important and was probably the basis for judging the fate of the negotiations. However, it is speculated that although the two sides are still far apart on the amount of debt relief, there may have been important results in the monetary field, because monetary issues must have been discussed at that time, and the news confirmed today that the New York Reserve Bank will cooperate with the Bank of England to maintain financial stability is enough to show that the talks that day were not without results. (National News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, since Treasury Secretary Acheson claimed that the Anglo-American war debt negotiations have temporarily abandoned the discussion of a permanent agreement and will only continue to discuss the December payment method, general attention has focused on the war debt issue, and it is said that the Treasury Department is now considering issuing silver certificates using the one thousand U.S. dollars in silver paid by the United Kingdom in June as a reserve.

<h3>Resolutions of the Anti-Smoking Association</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Anti-Smoking Association's 127th meeting on the 4th passed the following resolutions: (1) The draft convention of the League of Nations for the Prevention of Illicit Trafficking in Narcotic Drugs shall be reviewed in advance by the Chen Committee together with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Justice. (2) The Executive Yuan forwarded the report of the China People's Anti-Drug Society, stating that large-scale drug manufacturing plants have been repeatedly seized in Shanghai, and requesting a reiteration of the ban. The resolution was to forward it to the Shanghai Municipal Government for handling. (3) The study of the issues contained in the tenth recommendation of the Siam Opium Conference has been notified to the League of Nations by our country, expressing support. Regarding the implementation of the above experimental work, the Association shall jointly organize a research committee with the Department of Health, the Economic Committee, the Central Health Facilities Experimental Office, and the Ministry of Judicial Administration to carry out the work. In addition, the Association's committee member Tian Xiong and others made a temporary proposal, stating that the relaxation of smoking bans in various places is undeniable. The Association, as the agency supervising smoking bans nationwide, has no authority to deal with violating provinces. It is proposed to submit the violating situations in various provinces to the Executive Yuan, which shall be forwarded to the Central Government for instructions on effective measures to facilitate the prohibition of smoking. The resolution was to have the original proposers draft a memorandum to be submitted to the Yuan for approval. (Special Dispatch, 4th)</p>
<h3>Tan Changkai Punished; Dismissed and Barred from Employment for Ten Years; Crime: Secret Sale of Mineral Sands</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The case of Tan Changkai, Director of the Hunan Construction Department, who was repeatedly accused of secretly selling mineral sands, has been verified by Supervisor Luo Jiefu, who filed an impeachment. The Government Affairs Officials Disciplinary Committee of the National Government has resolved to dismiss Tan Changkai and bar him from employment for ten years. The person being punished, Tan Changkai, originally served as the Director of the Hunan Construction Department. The mineral operations bureau of various official mines in Hunan Province was managed by the mineral production and sales office of the Construction Department. After September of the 20th year, the office continued to sell manganese, antimony, white lead, and other mineral sands that were raw materials for manufacturing military supplies to the Changsha Liangchang Company and the Central Trading Company for export. After the Ministry of Industry sent personnel to investigate, according to a letter from Mr. Huergen, the Customs Commissioner of Changsha, from September to December of the same year, a total of 143,141 dan of white lead sand, 120,053 dan of manganese sand, and 65,252 dan of pure antimony and crude antimony were shipped out, all with permits verified and released by the Construction Department. The means of transportation by private boats and trains could not be investigated. At a time when the country was in serious difficulty, how could contracts be used as an excuse to disregard the facts and continue to issue permits for export, affecting national defense? Such a serious dereliction of duty should be severely punished. (Special Dispatch, 4th)</p>

<h3>French Parliament Trusts Sarraut Government; Socialist Party Abstains from Voting; New Cabinet's Life May Not Last Long</h3>
<p>(Paris) After the French Chamber of Deputies passed the motion of confidence in the government with 320 votes against 32, Prime Minister Sarraut stated that France is my religion, I love the country deeply, and the country is becoming greater. Therefore, I observe the country not only from nearby but also from afar. The country has a great mission to the world. I hope that those who support the Republic will give me assistance to achieve the great cause of the country. The government's financial plan will be submitted to the parliament in a few days, and we will strive to implement it. If the government must fall, then let it fall. The central party and the new socialist party both voted for the government, while the communist party and the extreme right party voted against it. The right-wing party and the socialist party, etc., which did not vote, numbered 250. (Reuters, 4th) (Paris) Today, the French Chamber of Deputies gave the new Sarraut cabinet a vote of confidence. 302 votes were in favor of the government's general policy, and only 32 votes were against it. However, 200 people abstained from voting, including almost all of the socialist party. It is now believed here that the socialist party's attitude is sufficient to indicate that the parliament has little genuine confidence in the government's general policy. Sarraut's announcement lacks a practical plan for balancing the budget and making up for the shortage of 58 million pounds. The previous cabinet was overthrown because it wanted to reduce official salaries. Today, the new cabinet is adopting a largely similar austerity plan, and it is feared that it will not last long.

<h3>Overview of Japanese Railway Management in Manchukuo; Railway General Bureau Fully Manages Manchurian Railway; Manchukuo Currently Has Approximately 6,000 Kilometers of Railways; Plan to Build Approximately 4,000 Kilometers More Within Ten Years</h3>
<p>According to Japanese newspaper reports, since March 1 of this year, after the railways in Manchukuo were entrusted to the South Manchuria Railway (SMR) Company by the puppet authorities, the SMR authorities began to pour in their years of experience to carry out the improvement, connection, and coordination of various railway operations, in order to smoothly implement transportation control. Since the implementation of entrusted management, the SMR Company has established the Railway General Bureau in Shenyang to manage all administrative matters and is currently proceeding step by step with the improvement of existing railways and the construction of new lines, in order to complete the Manchukuo railway network. The railways entrusted to the SMR Company by puppet Manchukuo include the Jichang, Jidun, Jihui, Sitao, Taoang, Taosuo, Qike, Huhai (including a part of the Songhua River waterway business), Shenhai, and Fengshan (including the Datong line and affiliated ports) completed railways. The total amount of loans is 130 million yuan. Other lines, such as the one between Dunhua and Tumenjiang, have also been completed. The line between Changchun and Tumenjiang has also been opened, which is the so-called Jingtu Line. The SMR also designated Rajin in North Korea as a port for goods entering and exiting North Manchuria, adopting the principle of using the three ports of Jinjin, Qingjin, and Unggi in conjunction, and connecting it with the Jingguo Line, the entrusted management line.</p>
<h3>Japanese Railway Policy Toward Manchukuo</h3>
<p>Japan's policies regarding transportation issues in Manchuria are two-fold: (1) Major railways take the principle of national operation, with economic development as the main focus. For the purpose of national defense and maintaining security, the total length of future railway lines is targeted at 25,000 kilometers, with the expectation of newly building 4,000 kilometers in the next ten years and merging the existing railways into 10,000 kilometers. (According to the existing railway lines, the total length of the Railway General Bureau Line is more than 3,100 kilometers, the South Manchuria Railway Company Line is more than 1,100 kilometers, and the Chinese Eastern Railway is more than 1,700 kilometers, totaling approximately 6,000 kilometers.) (2) For economic connection between production areas and seaports, in addition to domestic ports, the ports of neighboring countries are also utilized. (Note: "Domestic" here refers to puppet Manchukuo, and "neighboring countries" refers to Japan.) The naval policy prioritizes coastal routes and then ocean routes. Modification work is being carried out in Yingkou and Andong ports, and the Rongludao port construction plan is being prepared to improve the South Manchuria Railway-centric principle.</p>
<h3>Current Railway Length in the Puppet State of Manchukuo</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Kan'ichi Usami, Director-General of the Railway Bureau, the current railway density in Manchuria, calculated based on Manchuria's area of 1.2 million square kilometers and the total length of existing railways at 6,000 kilometers, is approximately 0.5 kilometers per 100 square kilometers. In Japan, this figure is 5.4 kilometers per 100 square kilometers. Even considering Japan and Korea together, the figure is 1.5 kilometers, which is three times greater than Manchuria's density. Therefore, there is a real need for constructing new lines in Manchuria. Currently, besides the Dunhua-Tumen line and the Laibin line, lines such as the one entering Jehol from Beining and the Haike line connecting Hailar and Qiqihar have already begun provisional operation. Other lines under construction total approximately 750 kilometers. The Jehol line will soon reach Chengde and Chifeng, and the Haike line is planned to extend northward to the Dalikhe River, opposite Blagoveshchensk. If these railway plans proceed smoothly, it is estimated that the railway network in Manchuria can be doubled within ten years.</p>
<h3>Water Transport and Automobile Transportation</h3>
<p>In addition to railways, the Railway Bureau also manages water transport and automobile businesses. Specifically, water transport on the Songhua River, Yalu River, Liao River, and other rivers is managed by the Railway Bureau. Manchurian ships have, starting this year, entered the main stream of the Heilongjiang River from the Songhua River, reaching Daheihe. Further development in the future is predictable. Furthermore, the automobile business under the new management format has become inseparable from the railway business. Separating them would only result in losses for both sides, as has been seen in Europe, America, and Japan. The South Manchuria Railway authorities, mindful of this, have taken over the full management of all automobile businesses except those with year-round connections to the railway. The automobile route between Beining and Chaoyang, which began operation on March 20th of this year, is the first example of this. Currently, it directly reaches Chengde. The passenger and freight transport service on the Chifeng line will also start soon. This is just one example. In the future, as the so-called 50,000-kilometer national highway plan of the puppet state of Manchukuo steadily progresses, the transportation system will become more complete than it is today, with automobile traffic in various places closely connected to the railway.</p>
<h3>Establishing Railway Villages Along Railway Lines</h3>
<p>The Railway Bureau employs approximately 40,000 people, mostly Manchurians. To foster harmony and closeness between employees and residents along the railway lines, the authorities are establishing railway villages along the lines. Within these villages, they provide improved grain seeds, raise livestock such as pigs and sheep to improve their breeds, and use various means to maintain cooperation between the people and the railway. They aim to ensure that the people benefit from the Railway Bureau's support, thus inspiring them to cherish the railway. (World News Agency)</p>
<h3>Insider Story of the Daishing Corporation of the Puppet State: Merging Former Official Subsidiary Businesses into an Organization for Profiteering from the People</h3>
<p>Harbin dispatch: The Daishing Corporation of the puppet state has been reported on by newspapers inside the pass in the past four or five months. Some have described its significance as being equal to the East India Company operated by the British in India, while others have referred to it as a joint mining enterprise between Japan and the puppet state. In reality, both are inaccurate. The Daishing Corporation originates from the merging of various subsidiary businesses of former official financial institutions in the three northeastern provinces, including the Official Bank of the Three Eastern Provinces, Yongheng Official Bank, Heilongjiang Official Bank, Border Industry Bank, and the Bank of the Three Eastern Provinces. Before the fall of the Northeast, these official financial institutions also operated subsidiary businesses such as grain shops, oil mills, and flour mills to connect with the social economy and support the market. After the fall of the Northeast, when the puppet Central Bank was established, all the official banks were incorporated into it. The former subsidiary businesses, which were used to support the development of the banking business, were reorganized into an industry bureau for operation. This bureau annually purchased grain and planned enterprises, with all activities aimed at generating profits for the bank falling within its scope. The oil mills, flour mills, and other subsidiary institutions, due to their existing nature and planned operations, were incorporated into the Daishing Corporation. Therefore, the Daishing Corporation is a unique part of the bank, unlike the previous situation where the banks themselves operated subsidiary businesses. The corporation's organization resembles a joint investment partnership between Japan and the puppet state, with existing assets valued at 25 million, supplemented by a Japanese investment of 25 million, totaling 50 million silver dollars. However, although the existing assets have been valued, the Japanese investment has not actually contributed a single penny. The corporation has a board of directors, with the chairman being Wang Huihai, the former assistant manager of the Jilin Yongheng Official Bank. Below him are two Japanese and puppet directors, and one resident Japanese director. Managers of local flour mills, oil mills, and pawnshops are all managed by one director. The corporation was officially established in early September of this year. The organization of the corporation may seem insignificant on the surface, but in reality, it is a mechanism for concentrating power, absorbing small capital, and exploiting the rural economy. In the future, within a year, the financial lifeline of farmers in the Northeast will be controlled by this corporation. Farmers, facing economic decline, will inevitably rely on the corporation for assistance and material supplies. Therefore, the corporation's substantial authority is no less than that of the East India Company.</p>

<h3>Military Tension in the Sichuan-Hubei Border Region Due to Bandit Suppression; Xu's Bandits Rampant, Sichuan Situation Worsens; Kuang and He Gangs Also Plot to Flee into Sichuan Territory</h3>
<p>Hankou dispatch: Since Xu Xiangqian's bandit gang entered Sichuan, occupying the three counties of Tongnanba, and then capturing Peng'an, Qu County, Yingshan, Suiding, and Xuanhan, the situation in Sichuan has been deteriorating daily. The He Long and Kuang Jixun gangs, which have been harassing the border regions of Hunan, Hubei, Henan, and Anhui, have also become active. Recently, they have even attempted to enter Sichuan in separate routes and join forces with Xu's bandits. The bandit suppression situation has undergone a significant change. Initially, after Xu's bandits occupied the three counties, under the planning of Liu Bocheng, the former chief of staff of Zhu De, they took advantage of the fact that Liu Xiang had not yet taken office and the Sichuan provincial troops were disorganized. They led their forces in a sudden attack, capturing Yang Sen's defense areas of Peng'an, Qu County, and Yingshan. Subsequently, they sent troops north, capturing Xuanhan and Suiding, inflicting a major blow on Liu Cunhou. The bandits' plan was to defeat Tian Songyao, Deng Xihou, Yang Sen, and Liu Cunhou individually, and then attack Liu Xiang with all their strength. Unfortunately, the weaknesses of the Sichuan army were exploited by the bandits. These weaknesses include: (1) After Liu Xiang took office as commander-in-chief of bandit suppression in Sichuan, he was unable to effectively command the various units of Deng, Tian, Liu, and Yang. (2) The generals were suspicious of each other, their strength was weak, and the soldiers were unpaid and unwilling to fight to the death. (3) Liu Xiang and others routinely imposed heavy taxes, with taxes already collected up to the 67th year of the Republic of China, causing widespread resentment among the people, making them easily incited. Thus, the bandits' advance was like crushing dry weeds. After the bandits captured Sui and Xuan, they expanded their strength, organizing themselves into four armies, with He Wei and others serving as army commanders, plotting to invade eastern Sichuan and threaten Yuwan. Liu Xiang, realizing the urgency of the situation, immediately returned to Chongqing to deploy defenses and ordered Tang Shizun's troops to guard along the Yangtze River, gradually stabilizing public sentiment. Liu then issued a martial law order for eastern Sichuan on the same day and set off for Chengdu on the second day. On the third day, he convened the generals to give instructions and decided to depart for Suining on the fourth day, issuing general suppression orders to all routes. However, the troops of each army were still not in good order. Liu Cunhou is currently consolidating his troops in Liangshan, making it difficult for him to take on one side again. Tian Songyao is stationed in Langzhong and Cangxi, barely able to defend himself. Deng Xihou has been designated to send troops to Zhaohua and Guangyuan but is still on his way to Shunqing. Although Yang Sen has telegraphed that he has recovered Yingshan, this has yet to be confirmed. Therefore, the so-called large-scale encirclement by six routes still requires factual proof to be credible. He Long's remaining bandits have been fleeing in the border region of Hunan and Hubei for the past few months. They were pursued by Governor Xu Yuanquan and unable to establish a foothold. Seeing Xu's bandits gaining momentum in Sichuan, they planned to join forces. A month ago, they entered Sichuan in three routes but were blocked by the Sichuan army and fled back to Hubei. They are now entrenched in the Xiaomo Creek, Pangzu River, and Huolongping area on the border between Lichuan in Hubei and Qianjiang in Sichuan, still plotting to enter Sichuan at an opportune moment. According to Xu Yuanquan's telegram of the third day, the bandits' internal structure has disintegrated. Duan Dechang, Duan Yulin, and Wang Bingnan, three bandit leaders, were all killed on suspicion of being members of the reorganization faction. Xia Xi seized the position of chairman of the Hunan-Hubei-Western Soviet government. He Long, Guan Wenying, Song Panming, Lu Dongsheng, Ye Guangji, and Chen Peiyin are members of the committee. Ye and Chen have since been killed, and Lu has been injured by bombing. The bandits' main force has been defeated by our army and is expected to be eliminated in the short term. However, the bandits are elusive, and preventing them from entering Sichuan is not easy. Furthermore, the remaining forces of Kuang Jixun on the border of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui are being suppressed by Liu Zhenhua, who is leading the troops of Sun Lianzhong, Liang Guanying, Shangguan Yunxiang, Hao Mengling, Wan Yaohuang, Peng Zhenshan, Song Tiancai, and Dai Minquan in separate routes. The bandit areas have mostly been recovered, and the remaining bandits, in a state of distress, are also planning to flee into Sichuan. One morning, at Xin'an Store between Minggang and Queshan on the southern section of the Pinghan Railway, a large group of six to seven thousand bandits crossed the railway and fled west. It is reported that they are the 25th and 28th armies of the gang, who first gathered in Zhengyang, crossed the railway, intending to pass through Biyang, Tang County, Nanyang, Zhechuan, and follow the upper reaches of the Han River, passing through Shaanxi and entering Sichuan's Chengkou and then Wanyuan. It is also reported that the local bandits of Biyang and Tongbai, Xiao Liushao and Gu Da 　　(Continued on page 9)</p>

<p>Sheng, after being severely suppressed by Xiao Zhichu's troops, also have a tendency to join forces with the bandits and flee into Sichuan. Considering the situation from all sides, Sichuan has become a haven for disaster bandits. If the generals in Sichuan do not join forces to suppress them, allowing them to grow stronger, the disaster of a prairie fire will be even more difficult to extinguish. (November 3rd)</p>
<h3>Strength of Various Armies in Sichuan Province: Total Reduction of 40,000 Troops; Liu Wenhui's Army Remaining at Approximately 30,000</h3>
<p>Chongqing dispatch: The Sichuan army, in its heyday, was claimed to be 500,000 strong. In reality, after thorough calculation of all units, the number was more than that, totaling over 600,000. Since the two Sichuan civil wars, the various armies have suffered losses of no less than 100,000. However, the number of reinforcements has been over 150,000 to 160,000. Liu Xiang, the commissioner of good governance of Sichuan, has recently advocated for troop reduction, so the strength of the various armies has undergone some changes. A brief account is as follows:</p>
<h3>Deng Xihou</h3>
<p>Deng Xihou's 28th Army originally had approximately 40-odd regiments. Later, due to changes in the situation in Sichuan, it gradually expanded to over 50 regiments. During the recent military resurgence in Sichuan, Deng's forces participated fully, absorbing the remaining units of the 24th Army, approximately 20-odd regiments, thus expanding to between 78 and 80 regiments. However, the organization of the divisions, brigades, regiments, and companies was often understaffed. On average, each regiment had approximately 6,000 to 7,000 men, totaling 50,000. Weapons and equipment were quite scarce. With a narrow defense area, the monthly military expenditure was insufficient, at less than 300,000. After Deng expressed his support for Liu Xiang, Liu ordered the army to reduce its size to 40 regiments and promised to provide 150,000 in monthly financial assistance, to be allocated by the commissioner's office. Deng then convened a meeting of all army generals to discuss the issue of troop reduction. After several discussions, it was decided to reduce the entire army to 50 regiments, with the troops of the former 3rd Division commander Chen Shunong being reorganized into 12 regiments, the 2nd Division Huang Yimin's troops into 9 regiments, the 7th Division Ma Dezai's troops into 9 regiments, the Training Division Chen Jingshan's troops into 6 regiments, the Independent Division Yang Xiuchun's troops into 6 regiments, and the 5 Mixed Brigades Xie Decan's troops being reduced to 4 regiments. Deng Xihou's directly controlled independent commanders Huang Ao and Niu Fanjiu's troops were combined into 4 regiments. Each regiment was limited to three battalions, each battalion to three companies, and each company to three platoons, with 30 men per platoon, totaling approximately 40,000 men. With the 150,000 in funding from Liu Xiang, they are still able to maintain the current situation.</p>
<h3>Tian Songyao</h3>
<p>Tian Songyao's 29th Army, in its heyday, totaled 60 regiments and four companies. During the Sichuan civil war last year, the various units of the army actively expanded, appointing a large number of officers and recruiting from all directions, attempting to follow in the footsteps of the 24th Army and build up a force of 100 regiments. As the army possessed the Chengdu Arsenal for many years, and each division also had small-scale repair shops, they did not feel a shortage of weapons and ammunition, making expansion easier. However, the army suffered heavy losses in the Chengdu battle and now has over 30 regiments remaining, including the 1st Division Dong Changan's troops with 4 regiments, the 2nd Division Zeng Nanfu's troops with 9 regiments, the 3rd Division Luo Naiqiong's troops with 4 regiments, the 4th Division Wang Mingzhang's troops with 2 regiments, the 5th Division Huang Futang's troops with 4 regiments, the Independent Division Liu Hanxiong's troops with 3 regiments, the 1st Route Commander Li Wei's troops with 2 regiments, the 3rd Route Commander He Zhanru's troops with 2 regiments, the 4th Route Commander Yang Jie's troops with 2 regiments, the 5th Route Commander Wang Zhiyuan's troops with 2 regiments, the Special Service Commander Tian Zefu's troops with 2 regiments, the Independent Commander Ye Jishi's troops with 1-odd regiment, and the Supervisor Commander Han Guozhu with 1-odd regiment. The above units are calculated according to their current numbers, but in reality, the units of the army have many vacancies, with some regiments reduced to one or two battalions, some battalions reduced to one or two companies, and some companies reduced to 50 to 60 soldiers. Among them, Zeng Nanfu's troops are relatively well-manned, while Wang Mingzhang's troops suffered the greatest losses. In each county of the Chengdu area, the army collected grain a total of twelve times, once a month, under the name of "Sun and Moon Donation." Recently, the army's monthly military expenditure has been insufficient by about two-thirds. Liu Xiang has promised to allocate 150,000 in monthly funding to the army but has limited the various units of the army to a total of 36 regiments, abolishing the brigade commander level, with the regiment as the combat unit. Above the regiment is the route, and above the route is the division. Each route commands two regiments, each division commands three regiments, and each regiment is prescribed 800 men, with the entire army totaling approximately 30,000 men.</p>
<h3>Yang Sen</h3>
<p>Yang Sen's 20th Army receives 100,000 in monthly funding from Liu Xiang. The army is currently planning to reorganize its entire force into three divisions, with Yu Mengji as the commander of the 1st Division, Yang Hanyu as the commander of the 1st Division, and Long Huanzhang as the commander of the 3rd Division. Each division commands three brigades, each brigade commands three regiments, each regiment commands three battalions, each battalion commands three companies, and each regiment is authorized 8,000 men, totaling 27 regiments, with approximately 21,000 men, and eliminating approximately 5,000 soldiers.</p>
<h3>Liu Cunhou</h3>
<p>Liu Cunhou's 23rd Army originally had only two divisions, totaling 20 regiments, with approximately 20,000 men. They were defeated by the Red bandits this time, leaving only 8,000-odd men. They are currently being consolidated.</p>
<h3>Li Qixiang</h3>
<p>Li Qixiang's New 6th Division and Sichuan Border Defense Commander, after relying on Liu Xiang, had a force of 10,000 men. During the recent military resurgence in Sichuan, Li absorbed a total of nine regiments from the 24th Army, thus expanding the troops to nearly 20,000. Liu Xiang was quite jealous of this and specifically limited the unit to 15,000, otherwise, he would stop providing food and salary. Li had no choice but to comply and is now reorganizing the entire unit into five brigades, with Li Dedong, Chen Shaotang, Wu Shengqing, Li Zongfang, and Ma Ciyu serving as brigade commanders, with each brigade averaging approximately 3,000 men.</p>
<h3>Luo Zezhou</h3>
<p>Luo Zezhou's 23rd Division originally had over 7,000 troops and has now also increased to 14,000 men. Liu Xiang ordered the dismissal of 4,000 men, leaving only 10,000 men. Luo has complied with the order.</p>
<h3>Liu Xiang</h3>
<p>In summary, the total number of troops reduced from the above units is approximately 40,000. All 40,000 of the dismissed soldiers were not actually discharged, but were completely recruited by Liu Xiang's 21st Army. Thus, the 21st Army has recently increased sharply from 110,000 to over 160,000.</p>
<h3>Liu Wenhui</h3>
<p>Liu Wenhui of the 24th Army, in his heyday, commanded 100,000 troops, occupying over 70 counties in central Sichuan. He was strong in both military power and wealth and could have achieved great things. However, due to improper measures in recent years, he lost the sympathy of the various armies, leading to last year's war. As a result, he lost over 30 counties of territory and suffered a loss of 20,000 troops. Despite the defeat, he still had over 80,000 rifles, over 900 machine guns, over 600 mortars, and over 20 boxes of hand grenades, and a territory of over 30 counties. This spring, the Sichuan war broke out again. The entire army was defeated, with those who surrendered surrendering and those who rebelled rebelling. Liu only led the remaining thousand-odd men and fled to Hanyuan in a panic. He telegraphed Liu Xiang for peace, which ended the dispute. The Yuya area remains as a defense area. Currently, there are approximately 30,000 troops in total. Liu issues orders in the name of the Sichuan-Xikang Border Defense Commander and has appointed Xiang Yuren as the deputy commander-in-chief, commanding the entire army. He has appointed Wang Yuanhu as the commander of the 1st Division, Tian Boshi as the commander of the 2nd Division, Xu Tingxiu as the commander of the 3rd Division, Deng Pancun as the commander of the 4th Division, Li Yushu as the commander of the 5th Division, Liu Yuantang as the commander of the 6th Division, and Liu Yuanzhang as the commander of the 7th Division. He has also appointed Tang Ying as the Xikang Reclamation Commander. The entire army has seven divisions and two commander positions, and is actively expanding and engaging in operations in Xikang.

<h3>The Completion of the Lankao Closure Project is Imminent - Liu Zhi, Zhang Fang, and Others Inspect</h3>
<p>Kaifeng dispatch: This year's Yellow River flood caused severe damage to Henan Province. Now that the period of high water has passed, various places are engaging in remedial work. The First Engineering Office of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission began construction on the 17th of last month to close the breaches in Lankao and Kaocheng counties. It borrowed the Ministry of Communications' radio station located at the Bian Telegraph Bureau to communicate with the breach closure sites on a daily basis. This morning (1st) at approximately 8:00 AM, Liu Zhi, Zhang Fang, Chen Ruzhen, two engineers from the Flood Relief Committee, Song Ke, provincial government technician Long Qingzhong, and adjutants and guards traveled by car to the two counties to survey the river project. At approximately 9:00 AM, they arrived in Lankao and rested briefly before being led by the county magistrate to inspect the breach at Xiaoxin Embankment north of Cailou Township. The foundation of the dike has been mostly completed, and there are currently over a thousand workers rushing to construct the remaining projects. At 11:30 AM, they arrived in Kaocheng. The county government office had been submerged by the flood, with collapsed walls and no rebuilding yet. The entire city remains a scene of devastation. At 12:00 PM, they arrived at the breach northeast of Yuanzhai. The dike foundation has been built three to four feet high, and there are over five hundred workers diligently working. At approximately 5:00 PM in the afternoon, they returned to Bian. The closure work is not difficult to complete. However, disaster relief for the affected people is a very major issue. At yesterday's regular meeting of the Provincial Relief Committee, it was reported that the Municipal Public Security Bureau stated that this year's Yellow River overflow caused an exceptionally severe flood, and refugees from the surrounding affected counties were continuously arriving in Bian to seek food, crying from hunger and cold. It was requested that the number of refugees in Bian be investigated and a list compiled for consideration and relief. It was decided to purchase 200 yuan worth of rice and distribute rice tickets to households in conjunction with the Public Security Bureau to provide relief. This one incident gives a glimpse of the entire situation. (November 1st)</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Between Wang and You's Troops in Guizhou Province: You Guocai Attacks Guiyang in Two Routes; Over a Thousand Casualties in the Battle of Zhenyuan</h3>
<p>Guangzhou dispatch: Since the dispute between Wang Jialie and You Guocai in Guizhou Province, their power has waxed and waned, and military conflict has continued unabated. Recently, Wang Jialie has been in power, forging alliances with neighboring provinces to solidify his position and continuously purchasing military equipment to expand the strength of his troops, strictly guarding against the resurgence of You Guocai and Mao Guangxiang. However, You and Mao were unwilling to remain dormant. After retreating into Sichuan, Mao Guangxiang raised funds and recruited soldiers on the Sichuan border, gaining considerable influence. After retreating to Xingren Panjiang, You has controlled the eight counties of Panjiang and recently advanced to occupy Shui Luodian, Ziyun, Guangshun, Dingfan, and Datang, appointing his own county magistrates, intercepting taxes, and increasing his troop strength to over 10,000 men. He has also joined forces with Mao Guangxiang's troops on the Sichuan border and Xi Woji's old troops on the Hunan border. Recently, he has declared war on Wang Jialie's troops. You's forces attacked Guiyang from two routes, with You personally leading the troops of Wan Baobang and others as the West Route Army and Che Mingyi, Lei Mingjiu, and Yang Qichang's three troops as the East Route Army. They launched simultaneous attacks on October 16th. Wang Jialie sent Liao Huaizhong, Wang Tianxi, and other troops to respond and telegraphed He Zhizhong, the commander of the First Division, urging him to return to Guiyang as soon as possible to discuss military strategy. It is reported that the two sides have been engaged in fierce fighting for days, especially in Zhenyuan and other places on the East Route, with over a thousand casualties on both sides. The outcome is still undecided. Both sides have backers in this conflict and have appealed to the provinces and regions they have previously contacted for assistance. As such, the civil war in Guizhou Province will likely not be resolved in a short time. (October 28th)</p>

<h3>The Bizarre Assassination of a Cook</h3>
<p>Chen Yonggen, the cook of the Public Records Rice Shop in this city, had previously guaranteed a certain amount of rice payments for Ayou, the cook of the Songjiang Grand Theatre. On the third day, he went to Ayou to collect 15 yuan and was returning home when, while passing the Gu Shui Daoyuan East of Zhu Xing Caishen Lane, he was suddenly attacked by thugs who stabbed him with sharp knives, causing serious injuries to his arms, face, and other areas. However, as it was around 7:00 PM and already dark, he could not identify the attackers. Later, he was informed by his friend, Zong Fugen, who lived nearby, who rushed him to Deqiong Hospital for treatment. His life is not in danger. The reason for the assassination is the subject of various rumors, and the money in his pocket was still there, suggesting that it was not a robbery. It may have been a love affair gone wrong.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<h3>Commissioner Gu of the Civil Affairs Department Inspects Suzhou</h3>
<p>Gu Renfa, the Commissioner of the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department, in order to inspect the administration of Suzhou and Changshu counties and to prepare for its reorganization, quietly left the provincial capital on the 3rd, after the routine meeting of the provincial government. He was accompanied by Secretary Yang Yiru. He arrived in Wuxi on the same day for an inspection. Yesterday (the 4th) afternoon, he arrived in Suzhou and first rested at the Garden Hotel. To avoid attracting attention, he used the pseudonym Wang Tongxuan and falsely claimed to be a member of the gentry. He then inspected the areas inside and outside the city for a week. His actions were very secretive, and at first, no one knew. Later, at 2:00 PM, he went to the Public Security Bureau, summoned the bureau chief and section chiefs for questioning and instruction. At 3:30 PM, he went to the county government to inspect for an hour. Before leaving, he gave instructions to the county magistrate and section chiefs. When reporters asked Gu for his opinions after inspecting Wuxian County, he replied with three points: (1) Autonomy: Wuxian County currently has thirteen autonomous districts, which is too many. In the future, they must be reduced and consolidated. According to regulations, each county should have fifteen districts. After consolidation, the funding and district administration should be better. (2) Public Security: It is heard that Wuxian County is rife with opium, gambling, and prostitution. The Public Security Bureau must work hard to investigate and ban them. If red pills manufacturing facilities are found, they should be handed over to military law for handling. However, the Commissioner himself (Gu Renfa referring to himself) once spent five jiao in Wuxi to buy twenty red pills, and after coming to Suzhou, he also spent one yuan to buy twenty pills, etc.</p>
<p>(3) Local Militia: In the future, military personnel must be appointed as deputy heads of the local militia. At 5:00 PM, he left the county government and planned to return to Zhenjiang that evening.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<h3>Second Installment of Land Value Tax Collection Begins</h3>
<p>Zhao Dihua, the Commissioner of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, recently sent special commissioners to various counties to supervise and urge the payment of overdue taxes and grain tribute due to the serious shortage of funds in the treasury. Regarding the second installment of this year's land value tax, which in previous years was collected at the end of the solar calendar year, it is now proposed to change the previous method, extending the overdue period from February to March, and advancing it by one month, setting the collection to begin on November 14th. The tax rate is 5 jiao, 7 fen, 9 li, 6 hao per mu. To consider the livelihood of the people, the exemption of the previous year's additional grain tribute of 2 yuan per shi and the land survey fee of 1 jiao per mu is approved. Instructions were issued to all counties to comply. After receiving the order, the county government of this county immediately ordered the General Affairs Section to rush to print the blank forms and instructed the secretaries of each district to expedite the preparation of the tax rolls, requiring them to be completed and submitted to the county within three days for review and issuance of the blank rolls.</p>
<h3>Government-Business Jointly Run Morning Granary Loans</h3>
<p>County Magistrate Yan Shenyu, in order to pay attention to the rural economy, plans to cooperate with the pawnshop industry, inviting each township pawnshop to serve as an agent warehouse, providing low-interest capital, and handling the pawning of rice and grains. The industry believes that this matter is also beneficial to the country and convenient for the people, and should be vigorously assisted. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, a temporary meeting was convened at the Pawnshop Association on Lianyuan Street. The "Wuxi County Twenty-Second Year Rural Granary Loan Plan Draft" was discussed and resolved as follows: 1. Establish the Wuxi County Agricultural Granary Loan General Office, located in the Farmers Bank, with one representative each from the county government, the Farmers Bank, and the Agricultural Association as members, and designate the Farmers Bank representative as the director. 2. Each pawnshop in the rural area will be an agent agricultural granary, all under the control of the General Office. The interest rate is 1 fen and 6 li per month, uniformly. 3. In addition to the Farmers Bank's agricultural granary expanding the pledged rice and grain to 40,000 shi this year, the remaining rural pawnshop agent agricultural granaries will borrow a total of 200,000 yuan from various banks in Wuxi with the guarantee of the county government, the Farmers Bank, and the Pawnshop Association. The interest rate is 7 li, and the Farmers Bank and the Pawnshop Association will be responsible for distributing it appropriately based on the circumstances.</p>
<h3>Citywide Street Vendors' Mass Petition</h3>
<p>The county government of this county, in order to rectify the city appearance and maintain road traffic, specially instructed each sub-bureau chief to personally lead the police to earnestly persuade and ban fixed stalls that occupy sidewalks and build sheds in their respective jurisdictions, requiring them to be dismantled and moved voluntarily by November 10th. After receiving the instructions, the second sub-bureau chief Fan Xinzhi and the fifth sub-bureau chief Peng Xiwu respectively ordered the police to strictly ban the Tongyun Road, Hanchang Road, North Hanging Bridge, Daqiao Street, and North Tang Street areas in each jurisdiction, and took the stallholders Lu Wenbin, Yu Zixiang, and Tong Jingen to the bureau separately, ordering them to move. The stallholders were greatly alarmed upon hearing the news, so they gathered more than a hundred colleagues and sent two representatives on the previous day (the 3rd), leading the stallholders to the county government to petition, requesting consideration of the livelihood of ordinary people, providing relief, and approving exemption from the ban. As a result, they returned without success. Yesterday (the 4th), each stallholder gathered again two or three hundred vendors from all over the city, drafted a petition, and went to the county party headquarters to petition, but also did not get good results.</p>
<h3>Nanhui</h3>
<h3>Bandit Leader Mao Muxiang Arrested in Jushan</h3>
<p>The area around the outer Tangjiao corner of Nicheng, which belongs to this county, has always been a place where pirates appear. A well-known bandit leader named Mao Muxiang has formed gangs and roamed rampant for years, committing numerous crimes. The people in the area feared him like a tiger. Since County Magistrate Yuan took office, he has paid special attention to bandits along the coast. In April of this year, when County Magistrate Yuan personally went to Nicheng to search for bandit dens, Mao Muxiang had already fled far away, so he was not captured. Since then, many of his accomplices have been captured one after another. However, since Mao Muxiang fled, he has continued to roam the seas, pursuing his pirate career. At the end of last month, the bandit was selling stolen rice in the Jushan area of Dinghai County, Zhejiang Province, when he was encountered by Xiang Yuansheng and Yang Shulou, informants from this county. They secretly reported to the local water police team, which dispatched Inspector Wu Dongchen with several plainclothes policemen to arrest the bandit. At the same time, the informants reported to the county government of this county, which sent Detective Chief Zhu Zishen of the water patrol team with four policemen on the previous day (the 30th), carrying official documents and passports to Jushan to escort the bandit. However, the bandit had already been transferred by the local water police team to the Second Brigade of the Zhejiang Maritime Police. After Detective Chief Zhu tried every means, he finally brought him back yesterday (the 2nd). It is heard that the county government will severely punish him to pacify the area.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<h3>Zheng Hongnian Visits Changshu</h3>
<p>Zheng Hongnian, the Vice Minister of Transportation and President of National Jinan University, came to Changshu for sightseeing at the invitation of Ge Renyuan, the current Director of the Changshu Education Bureau. The Education Bureau prepared everything to welcome him, and slogans welcoming Zheng were hung along the way. The ship arrived at the port at 8:00 PM on the 3rd. County Magistrate Zhou Heng, Public Security Bureau Chief Yin Cunfu, and all staff members of the Education Bureau went to the wharf to greet him. Later, Zheng went to Suzhou due to business, and only his secretary Yang Zeheng, Hong Chen, Cui Tongjun, and more than eighty professors and students came. Director Ge, because of his friendship with the teachers and students, hosted a banquet at Hongyun Lou that night. Zheng returned to Changshu from Suzhou at 11:00 AM on the 4th. It is scheduled to give a lecture at Xiaoyao You today (the 5th) and visit various schools and social education institutions, and then visit Yushan. He will stay for about two days and then return to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<h3>Planning to Establish a Lvsi Fishery Special Zone</h3>
<p>Lvsi is a famous fishing ground on the coast of the Yellow Sea. The Ministry of Industry plans to establish a fishery special zone. The Provincial Government believes that Jiangsu's important fishing areas and reclamation special zones are all in Jiangbei, which is an interdependent situation. The economic decline of rural and fishing villages is also the same. The relationship between them is very close, and the revitalization plan should take into account both. Therefore, County Magistrate Cheng was ordered to investigate and report the situation of the coastal fishing villages to the Fishery Association, and to prepare a revitalization plan for review, so that the Ministry can plan the fishery area.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<h3>County Magistrate Investigates Bribery and Connivance in Red Pill Case</h3>
<p>On October 27th, the county government ordered the Public Security Bureau to investigate and seize a red pill manufacturing facility at the Huang Gonghe cocoon firm in Xiaoqingyang. Because the main criminals Chen Changsheng and Chen Jinhe were at large, Wu Bingjun, the chief of the Second Sub-Bureau of the Public Security Bureau, went to Xishui and captured Chen Jinhe in Beizhakou. The next day, he suddenly claimed that he had not caught the suspect and reported to the General Bureau. According to Wuxi news, after Chen Jinhe was arrested, he asked Wu Liansheng and others to intercede with Wu Bingjun, bribing him with 1,400 yuan to release him. At 6:00 PM on the 30th, he also hosted a banquet for reporters from major and minor newspapers in Wuxi at the Dahua Building. Afterwards, County Magistrate Ruan investigated and, yesterday (the 3rd), specially ordered the head of the Public Security Bureau to first summon Wu Bingjun to the county for a secret interrogation. Wu insisted that there was no bribery or connivance in releasing the suspect. County Magistrate Ruan, considering that the case involved bribery and connivance in the red pill case, sent a special investigator to Xishui to investigate before further handling.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>County Government Plans to Build New Patrol Ships</p>
<p>The patrol boats of the county's water patrol team move slowly and are not suitable for arresting and patrolling. The previous county administrative meeting discussed repairs. It is now known that County Magistrate Ma has decided to prepare to rebuild two suitable new ships, ordering the Finance and Property Department to plan. The Finance and Property Department has asked Cai Zhongwen, who is familiar with shipping, to draw up ship plans, estimating that 669 yuan will be needed for labor and materials, and reported to the county government. The county has ordered Cai to quickly handle it in accordance with the plan. It is heard that a shipyard has been selected near Beilai Temple outside Bianmen. If the weather is sunny, it will be completed in a month.</p>
<h3>Bandits Attempt to Kidnap Township Chiefs at Zhenwu Temple</h3>
<p>Gu Sanliang Township of Zhenwu Temple, which belongs to this county, is located on the shore of Luyang Lake, where bandit activity is frequent. Several bandit boats suddenly came a few days ago and went ashore to kidnap the two township chiefs, Wang Bo and Xu Guohuai, saying that they had been notified a few days ago, but why hadn't they handled it yet, etc. Fortunately, the two township chiefs had heard the news in advance and avoided them, and were not harmed. The local people are now quite alarmed.</p>
<h3>Jiashan</h3>
<h3>Wang Liangcheng Family Theft Case Solved</h3>
<p>The home of Wang Liangcheng, a wealthy man in this county (president of the Zhengyan Daily), was suddenly robbed at night a few days ago, with gold ornaments and silver dollars stolen, valued at 2,000 yuan. Afterwards, the incident was reported to the Local Militia and the County Public Security Bureau. Director Xu Yanwu, in addition to personally leading a police team to pursue the criminals and inspecting the Wang residence for a week, also ordered the land and water police to investigate together. Four suspects, including Yang A Da, were arrested and interrogated strictly, and clues were obtained that the stolen goods were hidden in a thatched house on Xiaoshadu Road in Shanghai. Director Xu received the report and immediately sent several detectives, accompanied by Yang A Da and others, to Shanghai to pursue the stolen goods.</p>
<h3>Shangyu</h3>
<h3>Zhou Zhaotang Arrested and Sent to the County</h3>
<p>Zhou Zhaotang of Lianghu, Yuxi, was previously accused by Zhao Bowei of the same town in February of this year to the Provincial Department and Zhao Cisheng, Commissioner of the Seventh Administrative Special Zone, of organizing a crowd to intercept the Yuncheng Lan Qiongshan Buddhist scriptures, stealing and selling Song Dynasty editions of the Great Buddhist Canon, and smoking opium. Subsequently, the Provincial Zone repeatedly ordered the County Government to strictly investigate and reply. Zhou got the news and fled far away. He was repeatedly arrested but not captured. Although the Buddhist scriptures have now been moved to the county by Chen Zhongliang and others, the fourth district chief, and handed over to the Antiquities Preservation Committee for temporary care, sorting, and counting, a letter has been sent to the Shanghai Song Dynasty Buddhist Canon Association to send personnel to Shangyu for appraisal. Two volumes are indeed genuine Song Dynasty editions, but the catalog is missing and cannot be checked, so the case remains unresolved. Zhou secretly returned home a few days ago and was discovered by Zhao Bowei, who had previously filed a supplementary complaint with the Seventh Administrative Special Zone and received instructions to urge the County Government to arrest him. Therefore, on the afternoon of the 1st, he went to the county to report.

<h3>Zhang Zhichao's Troops Seized Two Japanese Warships at Sanchahe　Killing Japanese and Puppet Troops Over Three Days and Capturing Two Captains Alive　The Rest Jumped into the River and Drowned, the Number Unknown　Japan and Russia Are Actively Preparing for War, Eruption Imminent</h3>
<p>Zhang Zhichao, Commander-in-Chief of the East China National Salvation Army, specially dispatched Captain Wang Chuanjing, from the Daqingshan mountain area on the border of Heilongjiang, to send a letter to his representative in Shanghai, Zhang Zhendong, reporting that his troops had seized the Japanese traitorous warships "Yinxiang" and "Daheihe" on the night of the ninth of last month at Sanchahe. A reporter from the Far East News Agency met with Representative Zhang yesterday, who kindly introduced him to Mr. Wang. The details of the conversation are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Disguised Arrival in Shanghai</h3>
<p>I (Wang said himself) came to Shanghai this time upon the personal instructions of Commander-in-Chief Zhang Zhichao to meet Representative Zhang and report on the recent military situation of our troops and the seizure of the two Japanese traitorous warships at Sanchahe. I departed from the Daqingshan base camp on the border of Heilongjiang on the 16th of last month, disguised as a camel cart driver, carrying sheepskin goods. Upon arriving at Bayan, I gifted the camel cart to the farmers. Carrying sheepskin goods, I took a boat to Harbin. The Japanese army there conducted unusually strict inspections, with a total of nine checkpoints. They thought I was a merchant, so they did not interrogate me severely. On the 23rd, I took a train from Harbin to Dalian. On the same day, I took a boat from Dalian and arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. I don't know how many dangers I encountered along the way, but fortunately, I was able to turn danger into safety and arrive safely.</p>
<h3>Warship Seizure Circumstances</h3>
<p>A few months ago, there was a popular uprising in several counties in western Heilongjiang. The cause was the excessive oppression of the people by the Japanese. Unable to bear it any longer, they rose up. After the uprising, the people formed armies to resist the Japanese. However, the incident grew larger and larger. The Japanese Kwantung Army stationed in Harbin received the report and immediately dispatched three battalions of marines and three warships to suppress the uprising. When the "Yinxiang" and "Daheihe" warships sailed up the Nenjiang River to Sanchahe, our troops were already prepared and seized them. The details are in Commander-in-Chief Zhang's letter to Representative Zhang, so I won't repeat them. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Japan and Russia Prepare for War</h3>
<p>Recently, both Japan and Russia are in a state of high tension, with the situation being very serious, and an immediate outbreak is imminent. Both sides have completed the important wartime work. The Japanese-held combat areas are: one at Suifenhe Five Stations, one at Heihe, and one at Manzhouli. These three places are the gateways for the Japanese, and they are heavily guarded, with three or four divisions stationed at each place. Five layers of trenches have been built, connecting to various locations, and can accommodate heavy trucks. The artillery emplacements are made of reinforced steel and concrete. The Russian-held areas are: Boli, Hunchun River, the north bank of the Heilongjiang River, Hailanpao, the east bank of the Ussuri River, Shuangchengzi, and other places. The defense work is extremely meticulous and thorough. The construction of the airfield is also very solid and good. At present, both sides are eager to try. According to my observation, the outbreak is only a matter of time. The Japanese are training puppet troops to be driven forward, which is especially heartbreaking. However, the sinister intentions of the Japanese are evident from this.</p>
<h3>Zhang Zhichao's Letter</h3>
<p>Zhendong, my brother, I hope this letter finds you well. I trust that the letter sent previously by Zhou Fu, as well as the letter to Brother Du Yuesheng, have reached you. A few months ago, a popular uprising occurred in several counties in the west due to the oppression by the Japanese. The people were forced to form volunteer armies to resist them. Because the momentum was great, the Japanese army heard the news and urgently reported it to the Kwantung Army stationed in Harbin. The army, upon receiving the urgent report, immediately dispatched three battalions of marines on the 8th from Harbin aboard the "Yinxiang" and "Daheihe" warships along the Songhua River to the Nenjiang River, intending to fight against the volunteer army formed by the popular uprising. We learned of this in advance, and then on both banks of the Sanchahe, the border between Nenjiang and Songhua, we hurriedly dug more than two hundred trenches, preparing to fight to the death with the Japanese army. On the evening of the 9th, the two Japanese warships sailed to Sanchahe. The banks were covered with willows, and the river was narrow. The Japanese army was not familiar with the navigation route and immediately dropped anchor. The Japanese army did not know that volunteer soldiers were ambushed on both banks. At around 11 o'clock that evening, it rained lightly, and it was exceptionally dark. Then, more than one hundred volunteer soldiers secretly sailed close to the Japanese warships on four wind boats and issued a secret order. They leaped onto the two Japanese warships, and gunfire erupted from all sides. The Japanese army was completely unprepared and soundly asleep. The two sides then engaged in hand-to-hand combat on the ship for about three hours, killing more than three hundred Japanese and puppet soldiers and capturing two Japanese captains alive. The rest jumped into the river and drowned, and the number of deaths is unknown. In this battle, the "Yinxiang" and "Daheihe" warships, 171 rifles, 4 pistols, 4 machine guns, 4 cannons, and 2 anti-aircraft guns were seized. More than sixty Japanese soldiers were injured on the ships. There was another ship following the two warships, but its name is unknown. After hearing the gunfire, the ship sounded an emergency siren and quickly fled. Sincerely, your brother Zhichao, October 15th night at the base camp.</p>
<h3>Summary of Relief Clothing Distribution in Chongming</h3>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Society recently received a request for relief from the gentry of Chongming, stating that the disaster situation in the county was no less severe than in Qidong, and requesting relief. The Society had previously learned that the China Foreign Famine Relief Association had already investigated and that the Five County Fellow Villagers Association had raised a considerable amount of relief funds. The Society's relief funds were stretched thin, and there was nothing they could do. They could only prioritize the most urgent needs and provide some relief. Now that the weather is getting colder, there is a great need for clothing in the disaster area. Within the next few days, they will transport 1,000 sets of new relief clothing and 1,000 sets of old relief clothing, totaling 4,000 pieces, to Mr. Wang and Mr. Huang at the Tianci Shipping Account Room of the Chongming Steamship Company at Pier No. 10, Guanquiao, Bund, Nanshi, for distribution.</p>
<h3>The Production and Sales Company's Letter to the Industrial Sector: National Strength Should Be Cultivated Before the War　People Should Assist the Government in Striving for Production　Fifth Preparatory Committee Meeting Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>Since the Preparatory Office of the China National Products Production and Sales Joint Company issued its first announcement, various provinces have responded enthusiastically. There has been an especially eager response in sending letters and telegrams to participate in the founding and pay share funds. In order to facilitate the payment of shares by various provinces, the Preparatory Office convened its fifth preparatory committee meeting yesterday. Wang Xiaolai presided over the meeting, and Wu Zhihao reported on the recent progress and discussed the draft proposals for branch companies, national products warehouses, and chain stores. Finally, in addition to resolving to send a letter to the General Administration of the Bank of China, requesting the General Administration of the Bank of China to notify its branch offices in various locations to collect share funds on its behalf, it was also resolved to issue a letter to the national industrial sector. The wording is alert and thought-provoking, and it is expected that the industrial sector will rise up in response. The original text is recorded below so that the industrial sector across the country, which is working hard on production, can form a self-help and mutual aid association.</p>
<p>The Preparatory Office of the China National Products Production and Sales Joint Company's Respectful Letter to the National Industrial Sector: All those who are concerned about the national crisis are focusing on the world's future war as the current major issue facing our country. Once a great war breaks out, will we help A to attack B, or will we help B to attack A? Or will we allow A and B to commit suicide, and we will not take sides, standing far outside the circle of war to protect ourselves? Or will we wait for A and B to become exhausted, and then we will rise up as Bian Zhuang? This is not only a policy that the government should decide which is more beneficial, but all of our people should also prepare for how to assist the government. There must be preparations before there is strength, and only with strength can the people's opinions be valued by the government. Therefore, striving for production and cultivating national strength are the most important tasks that the people must not delay today. On the day of the company's announcement of the solicitation of shares, my colleagues could not help but offer our most sincere, albeit meager, insights to the industrial sector across the country, which is striving for production. The national strength of a country is entirely entrusted to the economy, and the principles of the economy are entirely based on land and people. My colleagues have already said this. From what we have said, it can be seen that the industrial sector, which is striving for production today, should know the importance of its position and carefully plan the strategies for struggling for production and for the country. Here, my colleagues would like to ask the industrial sector: Is the establishment of factories that our country needs today fully prepared, and there is no room for increase? Has the productivity of existing factories reached its limit and there is no room for increase? Is the production volume of existing factories equal to the national demand, and there is no room for increase? Are there already facts of oversupply of products produced by existing factories, and there is no way to promote them? Everyone knows that this is not the case. In view of the quantity of imported foreign goods, the reports of a sharp increase in enemy goods, and the fact that the people are forced to buy them out of need, knowing that this is like drinking poison to quench thirst, it can be seen that there are countless factories that urgently need to be built, and existing factories need to be expanded, and there are products that need to be sold. This is enough to prove that the path for the industrial sector to struggle for its own production and for the country is still extremely broad. However, with such a broad path, why does the industrial sector abandon itself and not strive for it? The answer is that it is not that the industrial sector does not want to strive, but that it is trapped by financial resources, lacks talent, or is hindered by the mutual slaughter of competition, and is unable to do anything. Therefore, the industrial sector, which is enthusiastic about production, must work together to create a new path for self-help, otherwise it is not enough to talk about production, nor is it enough to talk about struggling for the country. And the fall of the Northeast, the crisis in North China, or even the areas that have not fallen or are not in danger, are successively being controlled by the power of the violent enemy, and the facts of falling into danger are continuously emerging, or even more unfortunately, the whole country falls into destruction. Then, the description of the future world history, I am afraid that the arrows of blame will not all be collected on the government, but will be collected on our people. This is also why the industrial sector, which is striving for production today, in order to avoid future generations' blame, and in order to prevent future generations from becoming slaves, must recognize the new path of self-help and jointly strive for production and for the country. This is what my colleagues want to announce to the national industrial sector with the plan to establish the China National Products Production and Sales Joint Company. We sincerely hope that the national industrial sector will take the belief of self-help and mutual assistance and jointly assist in participating. The target of participation does not seek a large amount of investment, but only hopes that with the smallest investment, my colleagues can have a chance to do their best to plan. The sequential implementation of the plan in the future is to gradually complete the new path required by the production sector, which is striving for production. This new path is to call on enthusiastic people to organize local branch companies and establish chain stores to set up a sales network. The second is to unite the financial sector, organize national products warehouses, and undertake the flow of national products. The third is to gather specialized talents, organize research institutions, and establish industrial schools to create a pool of ideas and talent cultivation. All three of these are urgently needed by our industrial sector and are sufficient to help achieve the aspirations of various provinces to struggle for their own production and for the country. Moreover, the development of production and the increase of national strength are undoubtedly guaranteed. Even when the great war comes in the future, it can assist the government in deciding on the choice of policies. There is absolutely no justice or right or wrong in the world. If you want to clarify right and wrong, you must rely on strength. You must rely on strength to be able to cope with the advantages and disadvantages of the war. Otherwise, people will be knives and chopping boards, and we will be fish and meat. Even if the national disaster does not lead to immediate destruction, it will inevitably become a dependent, subservient state. May I ask the people of the country, are they willing to be the people of a dependent state? Now, the leaders of the party-state and the governors of various provinces are enthusiastically optimistic about the implementation of the plan and are rising up to assist based on the principle of common cooperation between the government and the people. Some send jointly signed founding certificates, while others send enthusiastic letters of support. The unity of the government and the public has laid the foundation. Do not miss the opportunity to dedicate yourself to saving the country. The benefits and methods of participation are hereby announced as follows. It is hoped that the industrial sector across the country, which is striving for production, will take note.</p>

It is currently being rushed to completion, and it will probably be announced to the public soon, he said.</p>

<h3>United States Far East Trade Statistics for August</h3>
<p>Continental News reported yesterday (3rd) that it received a message from the US Department of Commerce that the US's total imports and exports for Far East trade in August was valued at 64,194,000 yuan, (US dollars below as well) less than the 71,720,000 yuan for the last month by 7,526,000 yuan. This was mostly due to decreased US exports of cotton to the Far East and sugar from the Philippines to the US. However, compared to the same period last year, valued at 40,171,000 yuan, this has increased by 22,023,000 yuan. Excluding the Philippines, US imports from the Far East all increased significantly, and US exports to the Far East decreased only slightly to China, Siam, and Vietnam compared to last August. It was learned that the US purchases of goods from China in August this year totaled 5,478,000 yuan, almost doubling compared to the same period last year. US purchases of goods from Japan also increased by 40 percent, with silk fabrics, camphor, and crab meat showing the largest increases. As for Chinese goods, it seems that they generally increased and there was nothing special. Furthermore, among the US exports sold to China, except for tobacco, cedar, automobiles, and aircraft equipment, which slightly increased, the rest were not much different from last year. The total value decreased from 4,815,000 yuan to 4,704,000 yuan, a decrease of about 2 percent.</p>

It excels in painting various designs. Hearing of a public demonstration of the painting technique at the company, a reporter visited yesterday.

<h3>Huang Yuzhai Exerts Efforts to Mediate the Rent Dispute in Xiang'anfang, Zhabei; Landlord and Tenants' Negotiations Break Down; Mr. Huang Acts as Mediator, Dispute Resolved</h3>
<p>The houses in Xiang'anfang, Chang'an Road, Zhabei, are managed by the Rongchang Real Estate Department. A month ago, the tenants in the neighborhood, due to the disparity in rents, demanded rent reductions from the landlord, leading to a dispute between the two parties. Both sides took extreme positions and refused to yield. The landlord argued that due to cost factors, they could not make a profit and therefore could not reduce the rent. On the other hand, the tenants insisted on a reduction due to the commercial downturn. Negotiations broke down, with neither side willing to compromise. The landlord even reported tenant Wang Jianming for organizing an illegal group. Although the Social Bureau and the Public Security Bureau intervened for mediation, the results were ineffective. Both sides filed petitions, seeking legal remedies, inevitably leading to a lawsuit in court. Now, Mr. Huang Yuzhai has stepped in to mediate, exerting his best efforts to resolve the situation. After repeated consultations and clarifying that the matter involving Wang Jianming was a misunderstanding, both sides, feeling Mr. Huang's dedicated efforts to overcome the difficulties and resolve the dispute, agreed to compromise. The landlord voluntarily reduced the rent for one and a half months and was responsible for repairing the houses and installing electric lights. Thus, this dispute came to an end. Without Mr. Huang's assumption of the difficult task and his best efforts to mediate, this major dispute would have been unimaginable. It is now heard that both the landlord and the tenants have voluntarily published statements in the newspaper, expressing their satisfaction.</p>
<h3>Fire Truck Collides with Car; Black-plated Car Damaged</h3>
<p>At approximately 11:00 PM last night, a fire broke out on Route Comte and Route Lafayette in the French Concession. Fire brigades from various districts rushed to the scene to extinguish the blaze, which was quickly put out. As Fire Truck No. 3 was returning from the scene, traveling north through the Rue Balle intersection, a black-plated car, number 10099, sped across the intersection. Due to the high speed of both vehicles, they collided, damaging the mudguard and headlights of the black-plated car. Fortunately, no one was injured. Officers arrived to record the license plate number and investigate the cause of the accident, and the case was taken to the police station for handling.</p>
<h3>Carpenter Chops Young Woman After Plotting to Renew Old Affair Fails</h3>
<p>A local woman, Ms. Chen, lives at No. 9, Hongfu Lane, Xinzha Road. Her husband, Chen Azhu, works as a cook. However, Ms. Chen was formerly intimate with a carpenter named Jin Fa. After marrying Chen Azhu, the two cut off contact. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning around 9:00 AM, while Chen Azhu was out at work, the carpenter Jin Fa suddenly went to Ms. Chen's house, intending to talk to her and hoping to rekindle their old affair. However, Ms. Chen refused and told him to leave. This caused a conflict between them, and Jin Fa, unable to contain his anger, took out a working axe that he had been carrying and chopped at Ms. Chen. Fortunately, Ms. Chen dodged quickly and was only grazed by the axe on her left temple. She immediately screamed for help. Seeing that things were not going well, Jin Fa quickly fled. Neighbors, hearing the commotion, reported the incident to the Xinzha police station, which dispatched a vehicle to send Ms. Chen to Baolong Hospital for treatment. As the injury was minor, she was bandaged by the doctor and left the hospital on her own to report the incident to the police station. The police dispatched detectives to arrest the suspect, but he had already fled. The police have redeployed officers to secretly arrest him.</p>
<h3>Pang Fengzhi and Others Accused of Fraud</h3>

Li Dehua has hired a lawyer and filed a criminal self-accusation. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Deng Baosun of the First Special District Court opened a hearing. Neither of the defendants appeared in court. Their defense lawyer stated that one of the defendants was old and ill, and the other had gone to Suzhou, so neither could appear in court, requesting a two-week postponement. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that the defendants, having been legally summoned, should not avoid the hearing. If a postponement is granted, they must ensure that the defendants appear next time. Judge Deng then ordered the plaintiff to reschedule the hearing to the afternoon of November 17 and to bring his brother, Li Zhenhua, to court for questioning.</p>
<h3>Lin Xianjian and Young Woman Jia Lin's Marriage Dispute Case: Doubts Arise Regarding Lin's Evidence</h3>
<p>Wu Bin (courtesy name Chuba), a staff member of the First Section of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, married Ms. Jia Lin (courtesy name Huixian), an acquaintance from the past, as his second wife in Nanjing on July 30 of this year through a matchmaker. Before Jia and Wu were married, Jia was intimate with Lin Xianjian, the director of the Xianjian Hospital on Jiangxi Road, who is from Jieyang, Guangdong. Because Lin never agreed to marry her, she left Lin on July 24. After marrying Wu, she wanted to retrieve her belongings left with Lin, so she accompanied Wu to Shanghai to get them. Lin immediately reported the incident to the police station, claiming that Jia was his legal wife and had committed adultery with Wu. Based on his claims, the police filed a public prosecution against Wu and Jia. After repeated hearings in the First Special District Court, the defendant Jia Lin not only recounted the beginning of her seduction by Lin Xianjian during the Shanghai war last spring through cunning means but also pointed out that the marriage certificate and her wedding photo presented by Lin were altered or forged, requesting an investigation. The court granted her request and postponed the case to send official letters to the Jieyang County Government and government offices in Hangzhou and other places. During this time, Wu Bin separately filed a criminal self-accusation against Lin Xianjian for forging evidence and slander. That case has already been tried, and the defendant Lin Xianjian was sentenced to two months of imprisonment, with probation granted. The public prosecution of adultery is now being handled because the replies from various government offices have been arriving in Shanghai one after another. This morning, Presiding Judge Feng Shide continued the hearing. Before the hearing, the plaintiff and defendant were conducting a reconciliation in the courthouse's waiting room. The negotiations between the two sides were very close, and a peaceful resolution seemed possible. However, as the case was a public prosecution, it could not be freely dismissed. When the hearing opened, both parties still appeared in court to be questioned. Presiding Judge Feng first announced the replies from various places, and based on what was said in the documents, it was proven that Lin Xianjian's statements were mostly false. However, Lin still tried to justify himself with sophistry. The court, seeing that the facts of the case were already clear, ordered the beginning of the debate. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, immediately stated that although the plaintiff had presented various pieces of evidence, they not only failed to prove that he and Jia Lin were formally married, but the evidence itself was questionable and therefore should not be believed. He requested that the defendants be declared not guilty. Presiding Judge Feng then announced that a date would be set for the verdict.</p>
<h3>Carriage Wheel Breaks, Bride Bleeds</h3>
<p>Si Bao, the daughter of rice merchant Wu Qiaosheng, married Lu Heshang, the owner of a cigarette and paper shop in Jiangwan, last month through a matchmaker. The day before yesterday was the new bride's full-month celebration. Heshang returned to his father-in-law's house with his wife. They hired a carriage and prepared several kinds of gifts. The carriage was old and dilapidated. As they were traveling along Xietu Road, dozens of steps away from Wu's house, the wheel disc of the carriage suddenly broke, causing the carriage to overturn. Heshang and his wife both hit their heads and faces on the glass window, breaking it and causing them to bleed profusely. The coachman also fell down. The coachman managed to drag Lu Heshang and his wife out of the carriage. The bride's hands and clothes were stained with blood. Wu, after being informed, rushed over and took his daughter and son-in-law to his house, where he washed the blood off their faces and gave them clothes to change into. The bride suffered minor injuries and was frightened. Wu is now keeping his daughter and son-in-law at his house.</p>
<h3>Young Woman Hangs Herself</h3>
<p>Madam Pan Chen, from Changzhou, was 30 years old and married to Pan Manshan, who is now 31 years old and works as an engraver, earning only 15 yuan a month. The couple lived in a small room upstairs at the Sishichun Noodle Shop on Zhaozhou Road in the South City. After they married, they were initially harmonious. However, because Pan's monthly income was limited, their lives were quite difficult, and their family gradually became discordant. Quarrels often arose within the household. Yesterday evening at 7:30, the couple argued again over a trivial matter. Madam Chen, harboring thoughts of ending her life, took advantage of Pan's absence and hanged herself in the room. When Pan returned home after finishing his work, she had already died, but her body was not yet cold. He rushed her to Renji Hospital, but it was too late. Pan reported the incident to the Second District Headquarters, waiting for instructions to inform the local authorities and request an examination by the local court.</p>
<h3>Russian Woman Sentenced to Death for Murdering Lover Yang Ge Appeals</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that Mrs. Hatley, a Russian woman, who was accused of murdering her lover, Yang Ge, on August 16 of this year, was sentenced to death by Jones, the British Assessor in China, on October 18. She has since filed an appeal, and a full court hearing is scheduled to open in Shanghai on December 4. In addition to the original trial judge, the British Assessor, two more judges are needed. One will come to Shanghai from Hong Kong. How the court will be organized has not yet been announced. When the British Assessor delivered the verdict, the 12 jurors, while deciding that the woman was guilty, strongly requested clemency. The Assessor's verdict and the jurors' request have been submitted to the British Minister to China, and the execution must be approved by the British Minister. However, the British Minister also has the power to pardon, but a decision can only be made after the appellate court has made its final ruling.

<h3>Hubei Fellow-Provincials Association Dispute Resolved</h3>
<p>Hubei natives residing in Shanghai, wishing to unite their fellow-provincials' sentiments, originally formed the Hubei Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai. Later, some members, dissatisfied with the association's organizers monopolizing association affairs, formed the All-Hubei Public Association and the Hubei Fellow-Provincials Association Preparatory Committee to counter the association. This led to frequent disputes among Hubei native organizations in Shanghai. All three parties petitioned the Party and government for a fair judgment. Several years passed without a resolution. Now, it is learned that the Municipal Party Department and the Social Bureau convened representatives from the three organizations yesterday to discuss the matter and establish three measures to resolve the issue.

The resolution measures are as follows: (1) The Hubei Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai, the All-Hubei Public Association, and the Hubei Fellow-Provincials Association Preparatory Committee will each nominate one representative, new members will nominate one representative, and Guan Jiongzhi, who is enthusiastic about public welfare, will be publicly nominated, for a total of five people to form the Standing Committee of the Hubei Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai to handle all association affairs. (2) The Standing Committee must be established before November 10, and Guan Jiongzhi will convene the meeting. (3) The procedures for members of the Hubei Fellow-Provincials Association Preparatory Committee and the All-Hubei Public Association to join the association will be handled by the Standing Committee in accordance with the law.</p>

<h3>Zhao Weixian Sues Wei Tingrong and His Son for Instigating False Accusation and Obstructing Freedom. The Second Special Court Opened the Hearing Yesterday, with a Large Crowd of Onlookers. Because the Police Lawyer Participated, the Judge Considered It Inappropriate. As a Result, the Hearing Could Not Proceed and Will Be Rescheduled.</h3>
<p>Wei Tingrong, former commander-in-chief of the French Concession's Chinese Volunteer Corps and manager of the Zhongfa Silver Company, was the eldest son-in-law of the late Shanghai tycoon Zhu Baosan. On July 24 of the 18th year of the Republic of China (1929), at around 11:00 AM, Wei, accompanied by his two sons, was driving home from the Zhongfa Silver Company in his own car when he was suddenly kidnapped by bandits in front of the Da'an Warehouse on Zhu Baosan Road. They demanded a huge ransom for his release. Negotiations for the ransom took place in Hangzhou. After his family reported the incident to the French police, Chinese and Western detectives rescued him. Three members of the bandit gang, Zhu Jingcheng, Tang Shiliang, and Chen Zhongheng, were arrested, sent to the former French Mixed Court for trial, and sentenced to five years of imprisonment in the Western prison, after which they would be sent to the inland government for further proceedings. In the autumn of the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931), the French police arrested two more members of the bandit gang: Li Weicai from Nanhui, who was a lookout during the kidnapping, and Lu Ruowang from Shaoxing, who negotiated the ransom in Hangzhou. This led to the involvement of</p>
<h3>Wei's Brother-in-Law</h3>
<p>Zhao Weixian, a lieutenant colonel battalion commander of the 6th Battalion of the Independent Tax Regiment of the Ministry of Finance, who was from Zhengzhou, Henan, was found to be related to the case. At the time, Zhao's unit was stationed in Bengbu, and his family (wife, mother, wife was Zhu Baosan's ninth daughter, Ninth Miss, engaged to Zhao when he was an instructor in the Chinese Volunteer Corps) and younger brother resided in Suzhou. They learned that Zhao was taking leave to return to Suzhou to visit his family. Wei's son, Yuansheng, accompanied police detectives to Suzhou to arrest Zhao and bring him to Shanghai, where he was sent to the Second Special District Court along with Li and Lu for public prosecution. After repeated court hearings, it was determined that Li and Lu were indeed involved in the case. Li was sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment, and Lu was sentenced to life imprisonment. Since Zhao Weixian was a</p>
<h3>Active Duty Military Officer</h3>
<p>The ordinary court could not accept the case, and Zhao was ordered to be transferred to the military authorities for trial. After Li and Lu's sentences were finalized, they were sent to the Second Special District Prison. However, the Police Department disagreed with the Zhao Weixian part of the ruling and appealed to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. After the trial, the appeal was rejected. The Police Department still refused to concede and appealed to the Supreme Court. In April of this year, the police found Qian Lihe, a local Shanghainese who was the driver of the car used by the bandits when Wei Tingrong was kidnapped, hiding on Zhonghua Road in the South City. They immediately cooperated with the Public Security Bureau to arrest Qian and bring him to the Second Special Court for prosecution. A hearing was held, and the already convicted criminals Zhu Jingcheng, Tang Shiliang, Chen Zhongheng, and Li Weicai were brought from prison to be confronted. (Lu Ruowang was not brought because he had been transferred to a prison in Anhui.) According to Li and Zhu, Wei Tingrong had come to the police station, Guangci Hospital, and prison several times, offering them cigars, Dutch water, and candy to</p>
<h3>Incite False Accusations</h3>
<p>That Zhao Weixian and others were involved in the case. Subsequently, Qian Lihe was repeatedly interrogated, and due to the lack of evidence of his crime, he was acquitted. At the same time, the Police Department's appeal regarding Zhao Weixian was finalized by the Supreme Court after three trials, and the appeal was rejected. Zhao was still sent to the military authorities for review. The Military Law Department of the Songhu Garrison Command investigated the case and determined that Zhao Weixian had not committed any crime. He was declared not guilty and released, regaining his freedom. Zhao, feeling aggrieved by the false imprisonment and suffering damage to his reputation and mental anguish during the 20 months of detention, believed that it was all due to Wei's instigation and false accusations. He filed a complaint with the Command, accusing Wei. After repeated summons, Wei not only refused to appear but even detained the messenger sent by the Command. After negotiations by the Command, the messenger was released. The Military Law Department, considering that Wei not only refused to appear but dared to detain the messenger, which was unlawful, reported the matter to the former Commander Dai and</p>
<h3>Issued an Arrest Warrant</h3>
<p>For Wei Tingrong to be brought to justice for questioning. Now, Zhao Weixian has filed a criminal self-accusation with the Second Special District Court, accusing Wei Tingrong and his son, Wei Yuansheng, of instigating false accusations and obstructing freedom, requesting that they be brought to justice according to the law. Upon receiving the complaint, the court summoned both parties. The hearing was originally scheduled for the afternoon of the 12th of last month, but because the plaintiff had not collected all the evidence, he requested a postponement, which was reported in the previous newspaper. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the case was scheduled to be heard for the first time in the Second Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. The plaintiff, Zhao Weixian, wearing a military uniform, military hat (made of yellow wool), and black leather boots, arrived at the court on time with his agents, lawyers Zhang Shizhao, Qin Liankui, Chen Qun, Chen Heting, and Zhou Xiaobo. The defendant, Wei Tingrong, also arrived at the court with his defenders, lawyers Chen Lu, Yu Zhongluo, and Peng Qi. Many friends and relatives of both parties and news reporters who were paying attention to the case arrived at the court to observe the hearing. The courtroom was</p>
<h3>Crowded with People</h3>
<p>Almost to the point of being overcrowded. Judge Li Changnian, accompanied by clerk Wang Baoxun, took his seat and summoned both parties and their agents into the court, preparing to begin the hearing. At that time, police lawyer Yao Zhaodi had also entered the court. Judge Li first asked the police lawyer why he was in court today. Lawyer Yao stood up and stated that, according to the provisions of Article 2, paragraph 2 of the Agreement, the administrative authorities of the concession could participate in the proceedings. Today, he was participating in the hearing based on that article. The judge stated that since the establishment of the court two years ago, many self-accusation cases had been tried, but no police lawyer had ever participated. Today, he was not willing to set this precedent. As for the participation mentioned in Article 12 of the Agreement, it referred to civil litigation, while in criminal self-accusation cases, Article 346 of the Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that</p>
<h3>Public Prosecution Procedure</h3>
<p>Matters that should be presented or debated by the prosecutor, in a private prosecution procedure, are carried out by the private prosecutor. There are no regulations for participation, but since the police lawyer has claimed participation based on Article 12 of the agreement, this judge intends to request an interpretation from a higher authority in accordance with the agreement. This case cannot be tried today, and a new date will be set for retrial, the Li judge said. After Judge Li finished speaking, Qin Liankui, the lawyer representing the private prosecutor Zhao Weixian, stated, "Directing the litigation is indeed the court's authority, but in my opinion, while requesting an interpretation, the trial can still proceed according to the usual procedures of the Criminal Procedure Law. Now that the parties are present, please call the roll." Then, Yu Zhongluo, the defense lawyer for the defendant Wei Tingrong, stated, "Regarding Qin Lawyer's claim, I also agree. Because Article 12 of the agreement concerns participation, it is a civil lawsuit, so today it seems possible to</p>
<h3>Proceed with the Trial</h3>
<p>Judge Li also said, "This case is a private prosecution case. Now that the police are participating, it is inconvenient to proceed with the trial." He also asked the police lawyer for his opinion. Lawyer Yao stood up and explained the purpose of his participation, saying, "Private prosecution cases in the concession often do not follow Article 337 of the Criminal Procedure Law. The reason why the police have not participated in the past two years is because they did not know the details of the cases. Now that we know about this case, we are participating in court based on Article 12 of the agreement." Lawyer Qin then stood up again and said, "My request to proceed with the litigation is based on the usual procedures of the Criminal Procedure Law, not to say that it can be tried under a</p>
<h3>Special Organization</h3>
<p>As for Lawyer Yao's argument that private prosecution should be limited to Article 337 of the Criminal Procedure Law, not only is the precedent of the Special District Court limited to direct infringement of individual legal rights as stipulated in Article 337, but also Article 4 of the agreement, in public prosecution cases, allows the concession administrative authority or the victim to file a lawsuit, and the prosecutor executing the public prosecution only has the right to appear in court to present the case. This permits direct private prosecution, which arises from the agreement. If the agreement is to be invoked, then Article 4 should be given priority. Please consider Lawyer Yao's cited Article 337 of the Criminal Procedure Law and my cited Article 4 of the agreement together for reference." He also stated that the private prosecutor Zhao Weixian is a military officer, and his residence is not in Shanghai proper. If the court reschedules the trial, please issue a summons early. Judge Li agreed, and then announced the adjournment. The two spectators surged out like a tide, and the self-prosecution case with three-sided disputes shook the court, each with its own reasons, and it is not known how it will be resolved in the future.</p>
<h3>Lu Fengzhu's Appeal Case Lu Himself Was Not Present Yesterday The Judge Questioned Whether He Had Fled - Result: Trial Adjourned -</h3>
<p>Lu Fengzhu, the manager of the Zhonghua Printing House on Xizang Road, previously guaranteed that the Da Zhonghua Printing Bureau would print more than three million Sichuan Zhonghe Bank interest-free deposit certificates, ensuring that no counterfeit certificates of the same edition would ever be discovered. A guarantee contract was signed with Zhonghe Bank. However, not long after Da Zhonghua finished printing the certificates and delivered them to Zhonghe Bank for distribution, counterfeit certificates amounting to more than 370,000 yuan were discovered on the market. The Sichuan authorities arrested Wang Hongbin (who introduced Zhonghe and Da Zhonghua to sign the printing contract), and seized more than 50,000 yuan of counterfeit certificates. Wang confessed that these counterfeit certificates were printed in collusion with Lu Fengzhu, Xi Youtao, the manager of Da Zhonghua, Chen Yiting, and his brother Wang Zhian. Wang was immediately executed by the military. Meanwhile, Zhonghe Bank appointed Zeng Bing as its representative and hired lawyer Tan Yigong in Shanghai to file a lawsuit against Lu, Xi, Wang, and Chen in the First Special Court for forgery of documents. A judgment was reached, and Lu Fengzhu was sentenced to two years of imprisonment. In addition to the original guarantee that he would be available whenever summoned, he was required to post 3,000 yuan in cash as bail. Lu refused to accept the judgment and hired a lawyer to appeal to the Second Branch of the Higher Court. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhao Zhengtang of the Higher Court opened the court to summon him, but Lu Fengzhu did not appear. His representative, lawyer Peng, appeared in court. Judge Zhao immediately declared to the appellant's lawyer that, according to the bailiff's report, when he went to Lu Fengzhu's residence to summon him, the person living with him said that Lu had been on the run for two weeks. News reports also stated that Lu had escaped, which further proved it. Was Lu indeed evading justice? Lawyer Peng immediately stated that the defendant had gone to Moganshan to recuperate and was not evading justice. Future summonses should be sent to the Zhonghua Printing House, which could forward them. Moreover, the appellant is a member of the Chamber of Commerce. If he wanted to escape, he would definitely not waste public funds by hiring me to appear in court. The court should convict based on the law, but it only knows how to determine whether the defendant is guilty according to the law. His status is not something the court wants to hear about. Moreover, after the original trial, his written guarantors all went to the court to withdraw their guarantees, and they did not hand him over to the court, which shows that the appellant had a tendency to flee. Now, based on the bailiff's report that he has escaped, this court should arrest him according to the Criminal Procedure Law. However, lawyer Peng insisted that the appellant would definitely appear in court and that there was no danger of him fleeing, and he presented a medical certificate from a Western doctor as proof. The court asked if the lawyer could guarantee that the appellant would appear in court, but lawyer Peng could not take on this responsibility. Judge Zhao then announced that since the appellant Lu Fengzhu had not appeared, the case would be rescheduled for trial.</p>
<h3>Impersonating Officials and Defrauding People Arrested Pretending to Search for Opium Dealers Two Criminals Arrested, One Escaped</h3>
<p>Xu Huihao, a 50-year-old man from Hangzhou, runs a hotel and lives at No. 3 Ronglu Lane, Mayuan Lane, in the city. Xu is addicted to opium, so he has a set of opium paraphernalia at home. At about 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, two men suddenly broke into Xu's house. One was wearing a Western suit and had a short beard, and the other was wearing a traditional Chinese gown. They claimed to be officers from the Municipal Public Security Bureau and said that they had received a report that Xu's house was privately setting up a gambling den and trafficking opium, so they had come to search it. Xu, seeing that these people were imposing, did not dare to argue and allowed them to search each room. They found a set of opium paraphernalia and immediately wanted to take Xu to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. Xu was shocked and begged them to spare him from being taken to the bureau. The men then said, "We are here to search under orders from above. Now, considering that you are a legitimate businessman, please give us 50 yuan, which we will take to the bureau to help you out. Otherwise, there is no way to avoid punishment." At this point, Xu realized that the purpose of these people was to extort money. He pretended to comply and asked for a reduction in the amount. As a result, they agreed on 15 yuan, to be paid at Xu's house between 6:00 and 7:00 PM that evening. The men then left. Xu reported the situation to the Second Precinct of the First District, and patrol officer Hu Qiuqiao and police chief Li Fuyi were dispatched to disguise themselves as workers and wait at Xu's house. At about 7:00 PM that evening, the men came as agreed to collect the money. The police immediately stepped forward and arrested them. However, another man who came with them took the opportunity to escape. The two men who were arrested were taken back to the precinct. Yesterday morning, when Director Liu conducted a preliminary hearing, one confessed his name as Xu Zupei, 25 years old, a local, living at No. 3 Yongchang Road, Lan Nidu, Pudong. The man wearing the Western suit confessed his name as Zhang Pingjiang, 28 years old, from Shanghai, residing at No. 26 Yuanyuan Lane, Route Ghale, French Concession. The one who escaped was named Lu Jinsheng. The rest of their statements were evasive. Xu and the others were accused of daring to impersonate public officials and extort money, which was extremely illegal. An official document was prepared and they were sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Three People Suffocated by Coal Briquettes Tragic Change in the Yu Tongjin Family The Subletter Suspected Discovery</h3>
<p>Yu Tongjin, a 35-year-old man from Ningbo, used to work as a partner on a ship. His wife, Xu, was the same age as Yu, and they had two daughters, the eldest named Qidi, 9 years old, and the youngest named Shandi, just 4 years old. The family lived together in the kitchen lean-to at No. 15 Cihui Fang, Xilin Road, outside the West Gate. The night before last, Yu went to another port with the ship and has not yet returned home. His wife, Xu, lit a coal briquette stove in the room and cooked dinner on the stove, which she ate with her two daughters. Then she closed the doors and windows tightly and went to bed with her two daughters. Because the weather was a bit cold, she did not extinguish the coal briquette stove, intending to use it for warmth. Unexpectedly, at about 11:00 AM yesterday morning, the subletter of the house, Wang Xiaogui, and others still did not see Xu and Qidi get up, and they became suspicious. They knocked on their door repeatedly, but there was no answer. They then managed to break open the door and saw the mother and two daughters lying on the same bed, their faces pale and lifeless. They went forward to touch them and found that their bodies were ice-cold. The coal gas in the room was very strong and made people nauseous. Wang and the others were shocked and believed that Xu and the others must have been poisoned by coal gas. They reported the situation to Director Li of the Second District General Office. Because the matter concerned human lives, he ordered the head of the Fifth Tu to report to the Shanghai Local Court to conduct an autopsy. At about 4:00 PM, Prosecutor Xiao and others, who were commissioned, arrived at the scene for the autopsy and determined that the deceased, Yu Xu and her two daughters, had all died of coal gas poisoning. The bodies were handed over to the head of the district to notify her husband, Yu Tongjin, to come to Shanghai as soon as possible to prepare coffins and collect the bodies. After the autopsy, they returned to the court.</p>
<h3>Doctor Qu Shaoheng Expresses His Opinion on the Tian Yu Lawsuit From a Theoretical Perspective</h3>
<p>Lawyer Tian Heming sued Doctor Yu Songjun for negligence in his practice, which caused the death of his wife, Ms. Tian Gu Linyi, after childbirth due to dysentery. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Now, Doctor Qu Shaoheng has studied the case from a theoretical perspective to determine whether Doctor Yu should bear legal responsibility. His statement is very insightful. The original text reads: "November 1, 1933, Shanghai Shen Bao, carried a news item about lawyer Tian Heming suing Doctor Yu Songjun. After carefully reading the full text, the reasons stated in his complaint can be divided into two points: (1) The mistake of using ice on the postpartum woman (in obstetrics, after childbirth, she should be called a puerpera); (2) The negligence of not disinfecting the enema, which led to death from dysentery. I am in the medical field, specializing in obstetrics, for 18 years. I have been in Beiping and have been in Shanghai for less than a year. I have no acquaintance with Doctor Yu Songjun. I may not hesitate to make a fair judgment from a professional point of view, for the reference of the medical and legal fields, with no emotional influence mixed in. It has been a long time since obstetrics in our country has been underdeveloped. In recent times, with the gradual spread of Europeanization, a ray of light has begun to appear. After the establishment of the National Government, there was a clear determination to improve midwifery, and there were clear regulations restricting old-fashioned midwives. However, for five years now, there has been no significant progress. One is due to the lack of social awareness, and the other is due to the lack of government protection. The responsibility of an obstetrician is heavier than any other department, because it is related to the lives of both mother and child. Therefore, there are particularly many medical disputes related to obstetrics, especially in our country, where the government has no protection and society has no right or wrong. There are few doctors who do not walk on thin ice. Society can be blind, the law can also be blind, but academics must not be blind. This is why the attitude of a third-party scholar is so valuable. In my opinion, the Tian Yu lawsuit can be discussed in several points: (1) Can an ice pack be used for breast swelling? (2) Can an ice pack applied to the breast cause diarrhea or reduce overall resistance? (3) Did Gu Linyi die of dysentery? (4) Besides the transmission of dysentery through the enema, is there no other way? (5) Did Gu Linyi die on the ninth day after being discharged from the hospital, and should the responsibility be borne by Doctor Yu? (6) Is it medically accurate to say that if there is no disease three days after childbirth, then the puerpera's danger period has passed? (1) Can an ice pack be used for breast swelling? Milk is secreted by the mammary glands. The amount of milk depends on the strength of the mammary gland's secretory function. The strength of its function can be controlled by artificial methods. There are two ways to reduce it: (1) Chemical methods, i.e., applying medication; (2) Physical methods, such as ice packs. Ice packs are widely used in new medicine. In internal medicine, they are used to relieve fever and clear the mind. In surgery, they are used to reduce inflammation and relieve pain. In addition to the scope used in internal and surgical, obstetrics also uses them to stop bleeding. When human skin is exposed to the cold air of an ice pack, blood vessels constrict, blood flow slows down, swelling decreases, and the pressure on the nerves is reduced. Moreover, the nerves themselves become dull due to the stimulation of cold air, so the function of the organs is also reduced. Applying an ice pack during breast swelling is legal in terms of academic theory and facts. However, people in our society often criticize new medicine's use of ice packs, in a word, because they lack scientific (do not understand the conduction and dissipation of physical heat) common sense. (2) Can an ice pack applied to the breast cause diarrhea or reduce overall resistance? Exposure to wind and cold can cause diarrhea and reduce resistance. An ice pack is harmful if it is used improperly. Moreover, if the patient feels uncomfortable, he will not allow it to be placed for a long time. However, if it is used properly, the patient will feel comfortable and will not reject it. Gu Linyi had an ice pack from around 11:00 AM on August 3 to 3:00 AM the next morning (August 4). If she felt uncomfortable, she would not allow it to be placed for 16 hours. Since it was used properly, there is no reason to reduce resistance. If it is said that the cold air from an ice pack applied to the breast can be transmitted to the abdomen, then how can the direct placement of ice packs on the abdomen in cases of appendicitis, peritonitis, and gastrointestinal bleeding be explained? (5) Did Gu Linyi die of dysentery? Dysentery is indeed an infectious disease, but what Chinese people call dysentery often refers to ordinary chronic enteritis based on a slightly increased number of bowel movements and symptoms of tenesmus. New medicine's so-called dysentery must have infectious pathogens such as Shigella or amoeba. Does lawyer Nan Heming's claim that Ms. Gu Linyi had dysentery based on the results of a medical examination, or is it just based on the common customs of so-called dysentery in a broad sense? If there is no medical examination to confirm it, it cannot be designated as an infectious disease in law. (4) Besides the transmission of dysentery through the enema, is there no other way? Regarding Gu Linyi's dysentery, whether it is bacterial or amoebic, the source of the pathogen is still worthy of study. According to the usual practice, most of them enter through food. Why doesn't lawyer Tian Heming pay attention to food and only refers to the transmission of the enema? Yu Songjun is a formal doctor and should not lack the common sense of disinfection. The Zhongde Hospital is also one of the few obstetrical hospitals in Shanghai, regardless of whether its equipment is good or bad (I have never been there). I think it is unlikely that there is no sterilizer for the enema tube. Lawyer Tian's reference to the transmission of the enema must have seen something. If there were patients in the hospital at the same time as Ms. Gu who had true dysentery, whether the enema used was used by that patient, whether it was disinfected, and whether it was immediately applied to Ms. Gu, it is not difficult to prove the contrary. Gu Linyi died on the ninth day after being discharged from the hospital, and should the responsibility be borne by Doctor Yu? The Chinese people's faith in doctors is very weak, especially in new doctors. It is common to see that when they first seek medical treatment, they praise them to the skies, no different from immortals. If the medicine is not effective immediately, they become suspicious. If the symptoms are in the middle of their course and seem a little heavy, they change their minds and repeatedly change doctors. If they unfortunately die, they do not examine the condition of the body, the virus, or the doctor who treated them, as if their name has fallen off the list of successful candidates and the article is full of flaws. Gu Linyi moved to Tongde because she had diarrhea for three days in Zhongde, which is the common nature of the Chinese people. However, since nine days have passed since she left the hospital, and the patient began to deteriorate, should the progress during these nine days also be attributed to the former doctor? There is room for research on this from both a medical and legal point of view. It is difficult for doctors to be responsible for the safety of their patients' lives when they diagnose and treat them. (6) Is it medically accurate to say that if there is no disease three days after childbirth, then the puerpera's danger period has passed? Puerperas are no different from ordinary women. The diseases they get, in addition to a few special diseases, can also be suffered by ordinary women. Typhoid fever, diphtheria, scarlet fever, and other infectious diseases can all take the opportunity to invade. Why is dysentery unique? Does the so-called disease within three days only refer to puerperal wound infections, that is, puerperal fever? However, the incubation period of puerperal fever also varies depending on the type of pathogen. It is not a true statement in line with academic facts to say that the danger period of a puerpera has passed if there is no disease three days after childbirth. Combining the above points, Doctor Yu Songjun has his own reasons for not being responsible for the death of Gu Linyi. Lawyers can sue, and doctors can also testify. Fortunately, we in the medical profession can seek out the truth and correct it with a scholarly attitude."</p>
<h3>Follow-up News on the Death of Painter Gao Qifeng</h3>
<p>The death of the famous painter Gao Qifeng has been reported previously. It is now learned that Mr. Gao was unmarried in his life. The funeral was presided over by his adopted daughter, Kunyi.

<h3>Literary Figure Zhang Jumo Passes Away</h3>
<p>Mr. Longshui Zhang, whose literary name was Jumo, the secretary of the Sino-French Pharmacy in Shanghai, was a top disciple of Mr. Feng Junmu of Cixi. He was skilled in calligraphy and writing, and he enjoyed a long-standing reputation. He successively served as a teacher in schools in Ningbo and Shanghai and as an editor in newspapers. His novels were popular. In addition to his job, he supported himself by selling his calligraphy. Recently, he suffered from pulmonary disease due to overwork and died in his residence in Ningbo on November 1 at the age of 51. Mr. Zhang had great ambitions in his youth. He studied at the Hangzhou Military Academy and secretly plotted revolution. The head of the academy, the Manchu San Duo, wanted to harm him. He changed his name and hid in Cixi, devoting himself to literature, and ultimately ended his life in this way. He was honest and self-disciplined throughout his life and lived a pure and unworldly life. After his death, he was destitute and had no food at home. His friends Chen Bulei, Guo Xuanqian, Chen Hanwen, Ren Shigang, and others planned to raise funds to support his surviving family. There are many old friends of Mr. Zhang in Shanghai who are willing to donate money. Those who wish to donate can contact Zheng Weizhang of Yuan Maosheng Cotton Cloth Store on Nanjing Road.</p>

<h3>Taikang Company's New Factory Expands Greatly</h3>
<p>In recent years, the imported biscuit industry, seeing the great activity of the domestic biscuit industry in our country, has set up factories in Shanghai with new-style machines and huge capital from industrial countries, both to get rid of the shackles of tariffs and to be a strong enemy of domestic goods.

<h3>Hunting Prohibited Near Forts</h3>

<h3>Special District Court Announces the Course of Illness of Western Prisoner Bossack: Mayor Wu Sent Zhang Tingrong to Investigate Yesterday; Bossack Only Requests Transfer for Treatment</h3>
<p>Fuxing News Agency reports that the English-language Minle Weekly recently sent a letter to Mayor Wu, published in the newspaper, stating that an Austrian doctor named Bossack had been detained by the Second Special District Court for committing a crime and sentenced to a fine of 1,000 yuan. Bossack was unable to pay, resulting in imprisonment, which led to a serious illness. If he is not transferred to a hospital, his life will be in danger. They specifically requested the Mayor to find a way to provide relief. Since the publication in Minle Weekly, Mayor Wu has paid great attention. He specifically sent a letter to the British editor of Minle Weekly, Mr. Bowman, to come to the Municipal Government for discussion and asked Mr. Bowman to provide evidence. If this is the case, he will find a way to help. A reporter from Fuxing News Agency feels that this matter is sudden and has a significant impact on the reputation of the court and international relations. Yesterday, he specifically inquired about the details, which are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Reason for Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter from Fuxing News Agency first visited Ying Shi, the President of the Second Special District Court, to inquire about the reason for the Austrian's imprisonment. According to the President, Bossack, some time ago, using the pretext of opening a hospital, committed fraud against a Chinese man named Wang Maoting, obtaining 100,000 yuan in foreign currency. After the incident came to light, he was arrested by the police and brought to the court for trial. The court sentenced Bossack to repay Wang Maoting the money and pay a fine of 1,000 yuan. At that time, Bossack, unable to pay the money and without anyone to vouch for him, was sent to the detention center.</p>
<h3>Already Ill</h3>
<p>Initially, after the police arrested Bossack, they discovered that he suffered from diabetes and sent him to the prison ward of Guangci Hospital for treatment. During the trial, because Bossack's illness had not healed, he was still returned to the prison ward of Guangci Hospital after the trial. After the verdict, the detention center also deemed Bossack's illness to be very serious and immediately sent him to the prison ward of Guangci Hospital after receiving him. The claim that Bossack was critically ill in prison and would lose his life if he was not transferred to a hospital is somewhat exaggerated.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Prison Ward</h3>
<p>After meeting President Ying, the reporter from Fuxing News Agency obtained the consent of Gao Xiaoxu, the warden of the detention center of the Second Special District Court. Gao sent a guard to accompany the reporter to the prison ward of Guangci Hospital to investigate Bossack's condition. The prison ward is a Western-style bungalow with a fence surrounding the front of the eaves, resembling an animal enclosure in a zoo. The ward is quite large, facing south and sunny, with a large square lawn outside the door. The air is fresh and circulating. The ward houses five or six sick prisoners, with Bossack being the only Westerner. The prisoners all lie on iron beds, covered with clean bedding, similar to a third-class hospital ward.</p>
<h3>Bossack's Own Account</h3>
<p>The reporter from Fuxing News Agency met with Bossack under the eaves of the prison ward. Bossack, speaking in French, stated that he suffers from severe diabetes, with his urine sugar level having increased from 29 degrees to 39 degrees. His nerves have also been severely stimulated and are extremely disordered. He is now only seeking a transfer for treatment and is also requesting not to be confined in the same place as Chinese people, so as to avoid loneliness and depression due to language barriers. Bossack also said that he has a wife and five children living at 1086 Yuyuan Lane. However, since his arrest, the family's livelihood has lacked support, and he fears that they will soon become starving. Bossack spoke with tears in his eyes, and the scene was extremely tragic.</p>
<h3>Mayor's Attention</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu paid great attention to this matter. Yesterday morning, he specifically sent the intelligence director Zhang Tingrong to the Second Special District Court and the prison ward of Guangci Hospital to conduct detailed investigations separately. Zhang also personally asked Bossack what he wanted from the Mayor. Bossack replied that he only wanted a transfer for treatment, so that his mental disorder could gradually recover and his diabetes could hopefully be cured. Zhang promised to convey this to the Mayor and find a way to help him, and he comforted Bossack, telling him to be quiet and abide by the law.</p>
<h3>Haikingburg Circus Feeds Animals This Morning</h3>
<p>Mr. Shi Huide, the general manager of the Haikingburg Circus, announced that today is Sunday, and there will be three performances as usual, at 2:30 PM, 5:30 PM, and 9:15 PM. Ticket prices are the same for each performance. Starting today, animal feeding will also be held every Sunday at 11:00 AM. This will surely be welcomed by those who love wild animals. Previously, animal feeding was not held on Sundays. In the future, the feeding will be suspended on Mondays. In this way, visitors to the zoo on Sundays can also witness the real-life situation of lions, tigers, leopards, and bears competing for food. Among the new programs, the most exciting ones include at least three acts: one is Mr. Kaideng's amazing mixed wild animal performance, one is the airborne acrobatics of the McCombs brothers, and one is the "White Qimei" team's skills. The most amazing of all is Mr. Kaideng, who leans into the cage of giant lions, tigers, and black bears in the arena for a mixed performance of lions and bears, with the black bears standing upright and demonstrating the lightness of their feet. The success of this kind of mixed animal act is due to him being the number one in the world. In addition to these, the other 20 major acts are also very worth seeing. Anyone who has visited once will have an unforgettable impression. Even the several equestrian performances alone are worth the price of admission. Four beautiful women perform interesting equestrian skills, and Haikingburg's equestrian skills are also pleasing to the eye. Last night, Mr. Huang Jinrong and his family of 25 people watched the show at the troupe. Mr. Huang especially praised the act of climbing high poles and performing all kinds of amazing stunts.</p>
<h3>Yangtze Hotel Hosts Press</h3>
<p>The Yangtze Hotel, located at the corner of Yunnan Road and Hankou Road, will officially open on the 6th. At 6 PM last night, it hosted reporters from various newspapers in Shanghai, including Zhang Zhuping, Dong Xianguang, Ma Yinliang, Pan Gongbi, and others, totaling over a hundred people. First, Chairman Tang Haian delivered a welcome speech and introduced Manager Zhang Cai and Deputy Manager Zhang Deqing, highlighting their past experience in the hotel industry. He mentioned that Mr. Zhang had been operating a large hotel in London, England, for over 20 years, and Mr. Deqing has been specializing in this industry in Shanghai and has also gained a good reputation. Their cooperation is expected to be successful. According to Mr. Tang, the Yangtze Hotel spent two years building an eight-story building at a cost of approximately 600,000 yuan. All the equipment is extremely novel, and the total cost is as high as 2 million yuan. The interior decoration is a blend of Chinese and Western styles, comparable to the Cathay Hotel. The upper seven floors are for lodging, and the lower floor is a high-class ballroom without dance hostesses, similar to the Astor House Hotel. After the meal, the guests went upstairs to visit the various rooms, praising their magnificence and not being unworthy of being a giant of Shanghai hotels.</p>

<h3>What Crime is Committed by Buying and Selling Children? Lu Lindi's Statement Vividly Depicts the Scene</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 2 PM, Hou Xiaowen, a police chief from the First District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, found Gao Shousheng, Xu Silin, Qian Axin, and Changzhou women Jian Dengshi, Zhou Wushi, etc., with a girl, preparing to board the Huaan ship berthed at the Datong Wharf in Nanshi. Their appearance was suspicious, so he brought all six men, women, and children to the district. During the preliminary hearing, District Chief Guan Gong took the case. According to the girl, named Lu Lindi, she is 14 years old and lives at No. 47, Oujia Road, Beishi. A few days ago, while playing in front of her house, a man named Wang abducted her to No. 53, Xingli, North of the Nicheng Bridge, in the home of his mistress Qian Dengshi. Then Qian Dengshi took her to Gao Shousheng's home. Now Gao wants to take her to Fujian, etc. When questioned, Gao Shousheng confessed that he is 46 years old and lives at No. 55, Rishengli, Lima Road. Lindi was bought from Wang Daajie (i.e., Qian Dengshi) for 90 yuan. He has now resold her to a Fujian man named Lin, and the price has been set at 120 yuan. Therefore, today, he was helping her to Datong Wharf to board the Huaan ship and set off for the Lin family in Fujian. Because there were many people, they could avoid the attention of the police, so he invited Xu Xiaolin to accompany them to the wharf. Unexpectedly, they were still discovered by the police chief, leading to their arrest. Xu Xiaolin and others gave evasive statements. Considering that the matter concerned the abduction and sale of people, they were ordered to prepare documents and send them to the bureau for further investigation.</p>

<h3>A Stunning Performance Before Departure: Philippine Chinese Basketball Team Defeats Donghua; Donghua Starts Strong But Gradually Weakens; Philippine Chinese Team Has Strong Stamina, Winning 52-38</h3>
<p>The Philippine Chinese basketball team, since returning from the National Games, has had mixed results in Shanghai. Last night's final game against Donghua (i.e., Shanghai University) was initially predicted to be an easy win for Donghua. In the first half, Donghua was indeed very strong, leaving the Philippine Chinese team at a loss. However, in the second half, the Philippine team made a surprising comeback, unstoppable, causing Donghua to look at each other in dismay and confusion. As a result, the Philippine Chinese team won 52-38. Referee: Zhou Jiaqi.</p>
<h3>Scheduled Departure to Xiamen</h3>
<p>The team's competition schedule in Shanghai has ended. Initially, they planned to arrange a few more games with Western teams, but due to difficulties in arranging matches, the idea was abandoned. Many of the team's players are from Fujian, and the sports community in Xiamen has specifically invited them to compete there. Forward Yang Shufang had already gone to Xiamen, so she did not participate in the Shanghai games. The entire team is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Xiamen on the 9th.</p>
<h3>A Summary</h3>
<p>The Philippine Chinese team returned to China to participate in the National Games, initially defeating Jiangsu and then losing to Nanjing. In four games in Shanghai, they won three and lost one. Last night's victory over Donghua can be called a masterpiece and a glorious farewell. In total, in six games, the team scored 239 points and conceded 199 points. Star forward Yang Shufang returned to Shanghai from the National Games and immediately went south with the Fujian athletes, unable to compete in Shanghai. Otherwise, the results would have been even more impressive. The results of each game are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Victory over Jiangsu Team 47-23 National Games</p>
<p>(2) Loss to Nanjing Team 19-37 National Games</p>
<p>(3) Victory over Daxia University 51-24 Friendly Match</p>
<p>(4) Loss to Jinan University 25-34 Friendly Match</p>
<p>(5) Victory over Qianghua Team 45-43 Friendly Match</p>
<p>(6) Victory over Donghua Team 52-38 Friendly Match</p>
<h3>Donghua's Initial Strength</h3>
<p>At the start of yesterday's game, Donghua was extremely strong, overwhelming, as if entering an empty territory. The defense was tight, the forwards shot accurately, and the whole team worked very systematically. Qian Jingyong aimed accurately and acted nimbly, rarely missing a shot. Wu Guolin and Feng Nianhua each made contributions, finding opportunities on both sides, and everything went smoothly. Under great threat, the Philippine Chinese team almost completely lost its ability to resist, the formation became chaotic, and they were exhausted. The score was first 11-0, then 22-4. Donghua was far ahead, and the Philippine Chinese team's spirits were low, seeming doomed to defeat.</p>
<h3>A Surprising Comeback</h3>
<p>Faced with this major setback, the Philippine Chinese team was greatly shocked and requested a timeout to reorganize their ranks. From then on, the Philippine Chinese team suddenly made a surprising comeback, launching a fierce counterattack, shedding their weak and chaotic state and transforming into an orderly and energetic force. Zhang Liangxiong made several shots, and Lin Aoliu refused to give up. From then on, the team's morale was greatly boosted, and they became unstoppable. The score rose like a rocket, gradually approaching. At this point, Donghua seemed like the initial Philippine Chinese team, unable to defend on all sides and busy parrying. After scoring 26 points, they stopped there, only seeing the Philippine Chinese team rise step by step, accumulating 23 points. At the end of the first half, Donghua led by only three points.</p>
<h3>Tense Situation</h3>
<p>As the second half began, the competition intensified. Wu Guolin opened the scoring, adding two points. Lin Aoliu and Zhang Liangxiong responded with two baskets each, adding four points, making it 28-27. Donghua called a timeout to find another way out. Sun Baoqing quietly maneuvered, and Wu Guolin shot accurately from a distance, adding four points, making the situation seem optimistic again. However, the Philippine Chinese team was not willing to be outdone. What was lost quickly was regained easily. Lin Aoliu and Xu Zeyao continued to add two baskets, refusing to let go. The score was still only one point apart: Donghua 32, Philippine Chinese 31.</p>
<h3>Sudden Overtaking</h3>
<p>At this critical juncture, although Donghua still had the advantage, the score was so close that it was clear that the Philippine Chinese team was gaining momentum. Donghua was in a precarious situation, with danger on all sides. Sure enough, in an instant, Yang Shuhui shot from afar, hitting the target. The Philippine Chinese team suddenly overtook with a score of 33-32. From then on, their momentum grew stronger, and their skills became more refined. They charged left and right, succeeding everywhere. Lin Dengru jumped and threw under the basket, rarely missing. At this point, Donghua's formation became increasingly chaotic, like a plate of scattered sand, beyond recovery. In the end, Donghua lost 38-52.</p>
<p>Philippine Chinese: Shots, Fouls, Score; Donghua: Shots, Fouls, Score</p>
<p>Lin Dengru: 8 0 3 16; Qian Jingyong: 5 2 1 12</p>
<p>Zhang Liangxiong: 7 0 1 14; Feng Nianhua: 3 0 2 6</p>
<p>Xu Zeyao: 4 0 1 8; Wu Guolin: 4 0 0 8</p>

<p>Total: 25 2 7 52</p>
<p>First half: Philippine Chinese 23 points, Donghua 26 points</p>
<p>Second half: Philippine Chinese 29 points, Donghua 12 points</p>

<h3>Scott Cup Preliminary Round: Donghua Defeats West Merchant 7-0; Jinan Draws with Wovesse 1-1; Italian Navy Defeats Saga 4-0; Youyou vs. Lax Today</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in two Scott Cup preliminary round matches, Donghua defeated West Merchant team 7-0 in a seemingly effortless match. The current West Merchant team is mediocre and weak. Jinan drew 1-1 with Wovesse. Jinan's offense was very strong, but the left inside forward and left winger were slightly lacking, repeatedly missing opportunities, resulting in an initial 1-0 deficit. In the last five minutes, thanks to Luo Haiguang's pass, Fu Jiang Qiu Zhenglun redeemed himself by scoring a goal, resulting in a draw. In another match, the Italian Navy defeated Saga 4-0. Today at 3:00 PM, Youyou will play against Lax in the Scott Cup match at the Chinese baseball field. The details are as follows.</p>
<h3>Donghua Overcomes West Merchant: Wins by Seven Goals; Becomes a One-Sided Battle</h3>
<p>This is Donghua's first match in this year's Scott Cup, facing West Merchant. In the 90-minute match, Donghua dominated completely, with a final score of 7-0. Referee:</p>
<p>Donghua Team:</p>
<p>Wan Xianghua</p>
<p>Li Ning, Tu Kaiyuan, Chen Hongguang</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan, Feng Yunyou, Li Yichen</p>
<p>Guan Xun'an, Wu Youliang, Cao Qiuting</p>
<p>Jia Youliang</p>
<p>West Merchant Team:</p>
<p>Fa Pansi</p>
<p>Ke Lisi, Bo Qisi, Jin Bo</p>
<p>Gao Jin, Xue Fu Han Si</p>
<p>Fa Ping, Mo Lai, Han Tele</p>
<p>Bo Shito</p>
<h3>Analysis of the Two Teams</h3>
<p>Donghua's lineup is slightly different from the previous year. Chen Yutian, Bu Ye, and Chen Jiaqiu have withdrawn, so Cao Qiuting was selected, and Jia Youliang was invited. The internal personnel are completely the same as before. Yesterday's performance of the team showed a solid defense as always, with ample offensive vigor but insufficient strength. Given time, they should be even more impressive. West Merchant S.F.C. is lacking in talent, and the situation is getting worse. Forwards Hans and Jin Bo can barely cope. The goalkeeper is average, Fa Ping is acceptable, but the rest are not worth mentioning. However, their persistent effort and fighting spirit are commendable.</p>
<h3>Offside Nullification</h3>
<p>West Merchant met the challenge head-on. Within the first ten minutes, Donghua clearly gained the upper hand. Wan Xianghua made two passes, but Cao and Jia failed to connect properly, missing good opportunities. Li Yichen's powerful shot from 20 yards went straight into the net, but it was ruled offside. Subsequently, Cao Qiuting followed Wan's pass, preparing to shoot, but it was also stopped by the offside whistle. The judgment of offside must be precise, otherwise, both players and spectators will be uneasy.</p>
<h3>Three Consecutive Goals</h3>
<p>Twenty minutes passed in the blink of an eye. Jia Youliang passed from the right, and West Merchant's defense was lax. Li Yichen opened the scoring with a shot. West Merchant slightly rallied, but any progress was unfavorable. Soon, there was a change in the rear, and another crisis emerged. After Wan passed the defender, Jia kicked the ball onto Qiuting's leg, and it bounced into the goal, making it 2-0. Five minutes later, Cao Qiuting charged like a horse into a plain, advancing through the center line, past the inner defense, and making a solo attack. The opponents were unprepared and dismayed, allowing him to score, making the score 3-0 at halftime.</p>
<h3>Scoring Seven Goals</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the second half, West Merchant planned to recover lost ground with one effort, but ultimately they lacked the strength to achieve their goals. After fifteen minutes, West Merchant's defense collapsed, leading to an unstoppable series of goals. Li Yichen received a pass from Jia and shot, making it one of the most beautiful and crisp shots of the day. With a 4-goal lead, Donghua's offense became even stronger. Subsequently, Li Yichen, Wan Xianghua, and Cao Qiuting each scored a goal, resulting in a final score of 7-0.</p>
<h3>Jinan Draws with Wovesse: 1-1; Jinan Relies on Last-Minute Effort</h3>
<p>The Scott Cup match between Jinan and Wovesse was held at the Chinese baseball field, with 3-4,000 spectators. Jinan conceded a goal at the start of the second half. Thanks to efforts in the last five minutes, Qiu Zhenglun redeemed himself by scoring a goal, resulting in a 1-1 draw.</p>
<p>Jinan Team Lineup:</p>
<p>Qiu Zhenglun</p>
<p>Gu Shangxiang, Yun Feng, Wu Shufen</p>
<p>Xu Heng, Xu Yahui, Luo Haiguang</p>
<p>Lai Zuorong, Chen Zhenxiang, Zhang Hongzao</p>
<p>Mei Hongbao</p>
<p>Wovesse Team Lineup:</p>
<p>Jones</p>
<p>Dalahei, Weldon, A Qiao</p>
<p>Hebart, Da Smith Mao Lin</p>
<p>Eagledon P Smith Li Que Shi</p>
<p>Shepart</p>
<h3>Review of Both Sides</h3>
<p>Jinan's ability to achieve a draw can be described as a pleasant surprise. In the first half, Jinan's offense was very strong, but many shots were too high, frequently missing opportunities. Gu Shangxiang and Xu Yahui balanced offense and defense, and their tireless effort made them key players for the team. Xu Heng's goalkeeping was steady and extraordinary, saving many dangerous shots. The right side of the front line was acceptable, but the left side was too weak, repeatedly missing opportunities. Wovesse was exceptionally strong and tough, with a solid defense and fierce forwards, truly a formidable team.</p>
<h3>Minor Contact</h3>
<p>Referee Li Nuos sounded the start. Wovesse kicked off and attacked first, Jinan pressed forward, but their plan did not succeed. Qiu Ba was eager to try, repeatedly probing. Jinan occasionally showed a lack of coordination. Gu Shangxiang covered all aspects, rejecting all comers, and all attacks were blocked. At one point, Wovesse was awarded a free kick 40 yards from the goal. "Second in charge" Smith took the kick, and Jones attempted to sneak through, but retreated for offside. Jinan's Qiu Zhenglun's forward progress was blocked. Xu Yahui responded with a long shot from 30 yards. The ball was like a flying arrow, slightly high and ineffective.</p>
<h3>Frequent Misses</h3>
<p>Wovesse failed to capitalize on two corner kicks from the right wing. Yahui led the team to attack, and Eagledon kicked the ball in the wrong direction, landing in front of the goal. Wu Shufen slipped and fell, losing the opportunity. Mei Hongbao rose from the east, and Luo Haiguang shot again, slightly high and ineffective. Later, he received a pass from Little Mei and attempted a side hook shot. The ball was very fast, but slightly high by an inch, ultimately unsuccessful.</p>
<h3>Numerous Scares</h3>
<p>Wovesse, repeatedly besieged, attempted a counterattack. Jones launched two attacks, blocked by Carbon-Brother Zhenxiang, and was unable to do anything. Little Mei passed a high ball again, landing on the side of the goal. The position in front of the goal was empty, and it seemed that the fortress could be captured at any moment. Unexpectedly, Qiu Zhenglun was distracted and panicked, shooting wide. The audience sighed at this. In the rear, another emergency arose. Barbarian horses galloped across the border, disrupting Jinan's rear. Shepart swept across, as if in an empty land. Xu Heng wanted to advance but stopped. Mao Lin took advantage of the situation and shot, causing a scare. Fortunately, the ball flew behind the goal, averting danger, but it was still a great fright.</p>
<h3>Fall of the City Gate</h3>
<p>Jones did not give up his ambition and invaded again, riding the waves and advancing like a broken bamboo. The troops in the center followed closely, surrounding the city gate. Xu Heng, like a flying general, descended from the sky, grabbed the baby and averted the danger. Afterwards, Jones fired another shot, Xu Heng dived to save it. The first half ended without success. As the second half began, the soldiers revealed a stronger offense, Jinan was attacked from all sides, and the crisis was everywhere. Xu Yahui defended alone, busy parrying. Over time, Mao Lin scored a goal from the crowd, rolling the ball into the goal.</p>
<h3>Heaven Doesn't Help</h3>
<p>After Jinan conceded the goal, the entire army was greatly roused, determined to retaliate. Luo Haiguang received the ball and rushed forward, passing the defense, ready to shoot. Wovesse's goalkeeper, Hebart, saw the opportunity and stepped forward to block it. The two collided head-on, falling to the ground. Zhang Hongzao rushed up to shoot again but was blocked. Unfortunately, after this collision, Haiguang suffered too much shock on his foot and was unable to walk at the time. After a brief massage, he re-entered the field. Mei Hongbao dodged the enemies, passing the ball in front of the goal. Zhang Hongzao rushed up and headed the ball, hitting it squarely, but the ball bounced back off the crossbar. It can be said that heaven didn't help. Subsequently, they were awarded a free kick 20 yards from the enemy's goal. Yahui kicked fiercely, the ball landed and shot towards the goal, the goalkeeper dived and pushed it out, Wu Shufen picked the ball up and passed it forward, Little Mei headed it again and it bounced back. Another failed opportunity, a series of failures.</p>
<h3>Redeem the Guilt</h3>
<p>Luo Haiguang, unable to walk due to foot pain, switched positions with Xu Yahui, launching a desperate all-or-nothing attack. They fought like a trapped beast, creating a formidable momentum. The heavily fortified Wovesse could not avoid occasional lapses. Haiguang intercepted the enemy's ball in the center, passing it forward. Amid the chaos, Qiu Zhenglun, who had not yet made any contributions, fired a shot amid the noise of the crowd, hitting the target, redeeming his guilt, truly a lucky general. Jinan was like a fish finding water, forming a 1-1 tie. Five minutes later, the game ended. Carbon-Brother Xiang was injured and left the field in the last two minutes.</p>

<h3>The City Children's Welfare Association and Other Organizations Hosted the Xin'an Children's Travel Group. Pan Gongzhan and Others Wrote Inscriptions to Encourage the Children.</h3>
<p>After the Xin'an Elementary School Children's Travel Group came to Shanghai, it attracted the attention of people from all walks of life. The City Children's Welfare Association and the Children's Morning Post and other organizations hosted the children of the group at the Shanghai Joint Celebration Society at 2:30 PM yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Situation of the Two Associations' Reception: Yesterday, Director Pan of the City Education Bureau, Hu Shuyi, Zhao Zengqi, Zhou Wanghe, Chen Heqin (represented by Hu Shuyi) of the Children's Welfare Association, Xu Zhuodai of the Children's Morning Post, Wang Guanyi of the China Children's Care Association, Song Qingping of the Modern Children's Society, and seven children of the group led by Huang Jingwan of the Commercial Press participated. In addition to a full set of the Children's Morning Post, the gifts from all walks of life included a copy of the Modern Children's Book from the Modern Bookstore, and a box of Invincible Tooth Powder and a dozen toothpastes from the Home Industry Cooperative to encourage them. During the banquet, Chairman Hu Shuyi first delivered a speech, followed by welcoming speeches from Xu Zhuodai, Song Qingping, Wang Guanyi, Huang Jingwan, and others, with many words of encouragement. Then, Yang Yongxin, the representative of the group, gave a reply.</p>
<p>Inscriptions by Celebrities from All Walks of Life: There are quite a few people from all walks of life who have inscribed for the children of the group. Yesterday, Pan Gongzhan inscribed "Use the spirit of automation to seek self-reliant learning and cultivate your own noble morality," Tao Zhixing inscribed "Strange, strange, really strange, children teach children themselves, all seventy-two trades are teachers, and teachers are not in school but at ease," Hu Shuyi inscribed "The children our country hopes for are brave, lively, and organized children. The Xin'an Children's Travel Group deserves it," and Zhang Zhuping inscribed "Seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times."</p>
<p>The Congratulatory Message from the Family Cooperative: Yesterday, the Family Industry Cooperative, as two children's career institutions, hosted the Xin'an Children's Travel Group. In addition to presenting exquisite products, it also contributed a few words to congratulate and encourage them. The words said, "Our brave seven children, coming from Xin'an, leaving school, leaving home, without teachers, without fathers and brothers, leading themselves, coming to Shanghai, the purpose is to see the battlefield of Songhu Zhabei, to understand the brutality of imperialism, to be the pioneers for our national children, and to fight for our old Chinese nation in the future. We were very moved when we saw this news, because we felt that the brutality of imperialism was completely built on the invasion of commercial warfare, using their inferior goods to deceive our money to create their airships, warships, and guns to turn around and beat us, so although the purpose of our company is to build the war plan on industry, we will always stand on the front line of fighting the enemy, and we have never retreated a step in the past fifteen years. This is the same courage as our seven brave children of the Republic of China, so we specially selected the Invincible brand face-wiping tooth powder and Invincible toothpaste to present to our seven brave children, because these two products contain the beginning and end and history of our fifteen-year war plan."</p>

<h3>Believing Everything in Books</h3>
<p>— Tang Tao</p>
<p>We Chinese believe in books the most, but our Chinese books are the least trustworthy.</p>
<p>For example, when talking about heroes, it is definitely not enough to only talk about being straightforward and liking to help the oppressed. One must be able to soar into the clouds, have a white light on their finger, and also chase after people to kill them; if one encounters an opponent and is defeated, one must not die at the critical moment. Therefore, there will be enlightened monks to save them. Who gives the tip? It is said: "A sudden whim."</p>
<p>This seems too absurd to be believed, but it is not; in addition to roasting one's hands like sugar-fried chestnuts in hot yellow sand, there are even people who abandon their hometown, do not bring a penny with them, and prepare to fly to Wudang Mountain to learn swordsmanship from Taoists and monks.</p>
<p>We Chinese live under such thoughts.</p>
<p>However, "wise men" must object again. Because these books are not orthodox after all, and most of these people are also simple-minded. "Upper-class" and "higher-class" Chinese would not do this. But hold on, let me give you a few examples: (Zhuangzi's Xiaoyao You) In the North Sea, there is a fish, its name is Kun. The Kun is so big that no one knows how many thousands of miles it is. It transforms into a bird, its name is Peng. The back of the Peng is so big that no one knows how many thousands of miles it is. When it gets angry and flies, its wings are like clouds hanging from the sky.</p>
<p>(Historical Records) Gaozu drunkenly walked in the swamp, and a large snake blocked the path in front of him, so he drew his sword and chopped it off. An old woman cried at the place at night, saying: "My son is the son of the White Emperor. Now he is killed by the son of the Red Emperor."</p>
<p>These two books can probably be regarded as orthodox, right? But why are some of them like nonsense? A fish is so big that it is thousands of miles long and can also turn into a bird; the son of an old woman is a snake, but suddenly he is said to be the son of the White Emperor. What is going on here? "Wise men" believe it deeply without doubting it.</p>
<p>It must be said again that ancient books are not enough to restrain modern people. In fact, among modern people, especially among talented modern people, untrustworthiness still exists. For example, someone says that the tip of a woman's tongue is the tail of a gecko, then the tail of a gecko is the tip of a woman's tongue; if someone actually hugs the tail of a gecko to kiss, that's terrible!</p>
<p>Untrustworthy, untrustworthy, but I am afraid that there are still people who will believe it.</p>
<p>Famous quotes should not be missed, so let me add another one.</p>
<p>"The river is like a standing coffin."</p>
<p>How should such a treasure be viewed? Fortunately, it is a talented young poet. But this time, many people have been fooled. The poor cannot survive, so they throw themselves into the river, thinking that they will be safely coffined and their bodies will be spared from exposure. But soon they float up like dead pigs.</p>
<p>I don't want to advise people to write fewer famous poems and articles, but I hope everyone will not believe too much in them. Books are not entirely reliable.</p>
<p>Reliable books are not easy to exist!</p>
<h3>About the "Berlin China Art Exhibition"</h3>
<p>— Fu Yiye</p>
<p>Four months ago, I wrote a short article for the Chinese art exhibition to be held in Berlin, the capital of Germany, next spring. At that time, the art exhibition was just beginning to be prepared, but I overestimated myself and put forward three opinions: First, in terms of the collection of artworks, it should be publicly solicited from writers across the country, so that the quantity and quality of the works can be rich and perfect. Second, among the products of the ancient, modern, and contemporary periods, emphasis should be placed on the contemporary part. At least half of the works of contemporary writers should be included. Of course, ancient and modern paintings are better than contemporary ones. This only increases the artistic evaluation, and the current stage of Chinese art and the development of the entire art movement in the future actually rely on contemporary works to peek into and infer. The last opinion is that I hope that our artists will change the unpromising habit of being addicted to ancient things and the escapist ideas of pretentious literati, absorb modern colors in terms of painting materials, and create something with a sense of the times. If we continue to stick to the old rules and the paintings are still religious images of gods and Buddhas, figures in corner scarves and square hats, and buildings of wild temples and thatched houses, if we take this kind of thing to meet foreigners, people will suspect that China is still stuck in the Jin and Tang dynasties! That article was sent to a newspaper supplement in this city that talks about beauty and taste relatively, but maybe the article is not beautiful enough to be tasteful, or the manuscript is not a personal introduction of a considerable figure, so it was thrown into the wastebasket by the editor.</p>
<p>Now, seeing the news that the members of the art exhibition committee are going abroad on the one hand; on the other hand, Wang Qi, Gao Ailin, and others have raised questions, and today's Shen Bao also carries the suggestions of the preparatory committee members Lin Fengmian, Lin Wenzheng, and Qi Baishi to the preparatory committee. In this way, I feel that the article thrown into the editor's wastebasket is not useless after all. After moving the past opinions here, let's look at the development of this event.</p>
<p>Looking at the document presented by Wang Qi, Gao Ailin, and others to the Ministry of Education, it clearly accuses Liu Haisu personally of monopolizing the matter, so the collection of works is limited to a small number of writers in Shanghai, and they are not excellent works. Whether this is the case in fact, we outsiders will not know, but since there has been no public solicitation or exhibition during the preparatory period, it is inevitable to have such doubts, but even the preparatory committee members Lin Qi and others do not know that the committee members are going abroad (see the Shen Bao on the 11th). Because of other people's grievances, the three suggestions came. This is really confusing. Originally, those three suggestions should have been paid attention to when the preparations began. At this time, a second solicitation is made. Can this short time achieve "universal solicitation", then "collect widely" and "select in detail" to "strive for perfection"? A contract for more than two years and a preparatory committee established for half a year, but the solicitation of art exhibition works still has to be done at the last minute. What is the inside story after all? Let's wait for the parties involved to answer!</p>
<h3>"Pseudonym" and "Beautiful Name"</h3>
<p>— Yu Shixia</p>
<p>Literati in the Ming Dynasty liked to use aliases, called Taoist names. At that time, Taoism was flourishing, and there were many lecturers. The establishment of Taoist names was to cater to the public and show respect, which is what is meant by "scholars are called so-and-so sir." And those who are flattering and vile also use it to please those they respect, from humble and vulgar scholars to prominent celebrities and nobles, all have Taoist names. Someone once wrote a poem saying:</p>
<p>Mencius' name was Ke, but he did not say his nickname. Now, Taoist names are numerous.</p>
<p>The cuckoo is originally a famous yang bird, but people want to call it a cuckoo.</p>
<p>As for today, capable writers like to use uncommon pseudonyms, and one person has as many as a dozen pseudonyms. I have presumptuously speculated on the reason for this, not that they do not like fame, but to escape their literary fame; not that they fear debate, but to escape their responsibility for words; is it that there are many taboos at the time, and they have no choice but to hide their names? Also, today's movie stars and dancers like to use reduplicated words for their beautiful names. I don't know who started this, but there are more and more followers. Examining the beauties of the Tang Dynasty, many of them used reduplicated words for their beautiful names, such as Yuan Zhen's concubine named Yingying, Zhang Hu's concubine named Yanyan, General Liu's beloved prostitute named Zhenzhen, and Zhang Jianfeng's dancer named Panpan. There were also prostitutes who were good at singing named Haohao, Duanduan, Zhuozhuo, Xixi, the Yang family in Qiantang named Aiai, the Wu family named Saisai, and the Fan family named Yanyan. There was a noble concubine named Yingying in Tianbao. During the Dali period, there were talented people named Zhang Honghong and Xue Qiongqiong. Also, Yang Yuqing's concubine was named Yingying. Only what is mentioned in the Qixiu Leigao, the actual number should be more than this. It should be the fashion of the time, and it has not changed in the Five Dynasties and Song Dynasty. Now, this fashion is popular again among singers and actors. The innovation of literary pseudonyms and the restoration of ancient beautiful names are things that those who collect customs should think deeply about!</p>
<h3>A Trip to the Buddhist Kingdom (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Ba Jin</p>
<p>After visiting Mount Foding, I didn't see anything strange. I still wanted to go to Pusa Peak to see the sky lanterns, but there was no time. I also needed to meet my friend at the beach, as we had agreed beforehand. I should go down the mountain before the sun sets.</p>
<p>We didn't sleep well that night. People were playing mahjong outside, making a lot of noise for a long time. Later, the tea servers started arguing over tips. It only quieted down late at night. In the morning, before we were awake, the person in the temple who received guests came to knock on our door and wake us up, saying the ship had arrived. After eating breakfast, we followed that person down the mountain. It was very early, only five or six o'clock, but the sun had already risen, and the air was fresh. All along the way, we heard birds singing and saw the green shadows of the trees. As we approached the dock, we heard the steamship's whistle and hurried to the dock, but the ship had already left. We could see the yellow hull, the black smokestack, and the gray-black smoke. Yesterday, someone clearly told us that the ship to Shanghai would pass by here around seven or eight o'clock, but now it was just past six o'clock, and the ship had already left, far away. There was no way for us to catch up. Then, many female pilgrims arrived at the dock in sedan chairs, their luggage carried by porters. They seemed very confident that they wouldn't miss the ship, but in the end, they had to stop there for a while. After saying a lot of complaints, they had the sedan carriers take them back, and the porters carried their luggage back.</p>
<p>Judging from this situation, we were probably never going to have a chance to catch a ship to Shanghai. My friend worked in a factory in Shanghai, and his desire to return was truly like an arrow. I also didn't want to stay on Mount Putuo to see more of the monks' faces. But there was nothing we could do, so we had to return to the temple. This time, it surprised the receptionist monk even more. Later, thanks to him, he figured out a way for us to take a small steamer to Zhoushan. Taking a ship in Zhoushan was very convenient, as there were small steamers leaving for Shanghai every day from there.</p>
<p>We left Putuo at ten o'clock that morning, feeling very relieved, even though we knew we would be staying in Zhoushan for one night. But we had friends there to take care of us, who would provide us with all sorts of conveniences and show us some new and interesting things, things that would at least be more interesting than the monks' faces.</p>
<p>The reason I particularly mention the monks' faces is because there are so many monks on Putuo, everywhere you look. Monks also know how to deal with guests, how to calculate money, how to employ servants, and how to do business, just like ordinary merchants. Temples have guest rooms, which are like hotels in Shanghai. The new facilities are complete, and in addition to the tea servers who serve the guests, there are also receptionists who pick up and drop off guests. The food is vegetarian, but guests can also buy meat dishes and bring them in. Wealthy people can also get all sorts of conveniences here. We once found a opium pipe under the sofa cover in our room. We heard the sound of mahjong tiles, only missing seeing someone calling in prostitutes.</p>
<p>The night before we left Putuo, we had a conversation with the receptionist monk. That monk was fat and had big ears, but he had a clever mind. He spoke beautifully, knew the dialects of several provinces, and was especially good at flattering female pilgrims. What he said to us was very frank. He said, "The temples on Mount Putuo only do business for these few months every year. But the expenses are too high. In the past two years, the competition has been too fierce, and business hasn't been very good, so everyone inevitably loses money. This business is really hard to do, but many monks rely on it for a living, and there's nothing else to do if we don't do it." The meaning was very clear. So, when pilgrims come to their door, they have to fleece them. Doing a Water and Land Dharma Assembly costs at least a thousand dollars. Doing a small Buddhist service costs more than a hundred dollars. But the wives and young ladies of gentlemen don't care at all. I unintentionally saw a Water and Land Dharma Assembly at another temple. I really can't find words to describe how the monks flattered the female pilgrims. Only classical painters could paint their faces in detail.</p>
<p>We received considerable preferential treatment on Mount Putuo. I felt more comfortable in the temple than in a hotel in Shanghai. So, I believe my description doesn't have any bias. When I returned to Shanghai, someone asked me what impressions I brought back. I replied that I had visited a large marketplace, where the goods being traded were Bodhisattvas, and the merchants doing business were super merchants. I myself was just a most ungenerous customer. (The End)</p>
<h3>Two Brothers (19)</h3>
<p>— Guy de Maupassant, translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>Then, one of those thoughts that often came to him so abruptly, so quickly, that he could neither foresee, nor control, nor change, one of those thoughts that he felt as if it came from another independent and fierce soul, crossed his mind: "Bah! He's too stupid. He won't go and enjoy himself like that. He'll marry that little widow Lu."</p>
<p>He stood up.</p>
<p>"I'll let you dream about your future alone; as for me, I need to take a walk."</p>
<p>He shook hands with his brother, and then said in a very sincere tone:</p>
<p>"Well, my little Zhe'an, you're rich now! I'm very happy to be able to meet you alone tonight, so I can tell you how happy this makes me, how much I congratulate you, and how much I love you."</p>
<p>Gentle and docile Zhe'an was very touched by these words and said falteringly:</p>
<p>"Thank you… thank you… my good Bi'er, thank you."</p>
<p>So Bi'er slowly walked back alone, his cane hanging on his arm, his hands clasped behind his back.</p>
<p>As he walked back to the city, he considered what to do for amusement. He was unable to enjoy his walk fully because he encountered his brother, unable to enjoy the sea view fully, and felt very unhappy.</p>
<p>He suddenly thought: "I'll go to old man Malosco's place for a glass of sweet wine;" so he walked towards the Danguwier district again.</p>
<p>He had met old man Malosco when he was an intern at the public hospitals in Paris. This was an old Polish man who had fled the country for political reasons. According to others, he had been involved in some terrible stories in Poland. He came to France, took another exam, and then practiced his profession as a pharmacist. No one knew anything about his past life, so various legends about him circulated among the interns and externs at the hospital, and later among his neighbors. This reputation of a terrible rebel, nihilist, regicide, and reckless patriot who had miraculously secured his head, stirred Roland Bi'er's adventurous and passionate imagination; therefore, he became good friends with this Polish old man, but he never heard any confessions from him about his previous life. This old man also relied on the young doctor's help to open his business in Havre. He hoped that this new doctor would bring him many customers.</p>
<p>Before this hope was realized, he had to live a simple life in his humble pharmacy, temporarily maintaining his life by doing small business with the small property owners and workers in his district.</p>
<p>Bi'er often went to see him after dinner and sat with him for a long time, because he liked Malosco's quiet face and rare conversation. He felt that his long silences were very meaningful.</p>

<h3>A Look at Sports in the Past and Present</h3>
<p>— Qian Zuizhu</p>
<p>Sports, in our country, is "what I rely on to exist." For example, the "shooting" and "charioteering" in the "Six Arts" contain the function of tempering the body, just like the current sports. Moreover, "their competition is gentlemanly," showing that people at the time also attached great importance to the morality of sports. Therefore, the talents of that time were both literary and martial. It wasn't until later that the literary and martial paths diverged, resulting in the great harm of "the scholar cannot bind a chicken, and the warrior cannot read."</p>
<p>I remember in my childhood, schools were newly founded, and sports were immature. There were very few events, only knowing a few items such as running, high jump, low hurdles, group exercises, and apparatus exercises. At that time, most of the teachers only knew about sports, not about training. The principals only knew how to encourage students to work hard and show off for the school, without paying attention to the students' physical condition and without asking about daily hygiene. Young people were eager to win, using seven parts of their physical strength to do ten parts of sports. As a result, I don't know how many good students were sacrificed. Every sports meet, I don't know how many tragedies were hidden. (I was one of them, the disease of spitting blood harmed my lifelong career.) It wasn't until the last ten years that this malpractice has been slightly reduced. But there are still those who treat students' lives as a child's play, like this year, when a student from a certain school died in swimming due to the teacher's carelessness. But these are only a few. On the whole, it has indeed entered the right track of sports. The "right eye" for tempering the body has been recognized. It is no longer the sport of young masters and misses, but the activity of brave and healthy youths.</p>
<p>I say this with evidence; just look at the students now, eight out of ten are muscular and strong, and their bones are stretched. It can be seen that they have received average development training on weekdays, so they have this strong harvest. No wonder this time's National Games will create many new records. In short, the previous was a malformed sport of abandoning the root and pursuing the tip, and now it is a basic training of universal development. In the past, it was seven parts of the body doing ten parts of sports. Now it is ten parts of capital doing ten parts of competition. Among the various current situations in the country, it is the only gratifying progress.</p>
<p>Finally, I believe that the people of the country should give a stable life to outstanding talents, such as Liu Changchun and Fu Baolu, so as not to bury heroes. (The report said how pitiful was the cold treatment and neglect that the old athlete Mr. Zhu Ende encountered.) We must be more careful to protect them, so as not to be plotted against. It must be known that there is a deadly enemy around us who does not allow us to have outstanding talents. (There are many previous examples, not only in the field of sports. Many of our country's talents have been victimized by their conspiracies.) So, if we still do not know how to love and protect them, and let them live and die on their own, then the next international sports, not only will we not be able to win, I am afraid that even Mr. Situ's "extreme jump" will not be able to be achieved.</p>
<h3>Expectation</h3>
<p>— Yongzi</p>
<p>Wang Xiao'er suffered a loss from Zhang Da'gezi, and finally couldn't think of a way to turn the tables. He also didn't have the patience to go to Mount Emei to cultivate and practice hard, in order to prepare for a gentleman's revenge after three years. So he had no choice but to cross his arms and hide in the corner of the door, chanting "Amitabha Buddha" and praying to the Great Compassionate Avalokitesvara and the Savior of Suffering, to bring misfortune to Zhang Da'gezi, so that he would choke to death while eating, fall to his death while walking, drown to death while crossing the bridge, and die of heatstroke in June. After some time, seeing that Zhang Da'gezi didn't even get prickly heat and didn't even sneeze, he changed direction, day and night hoping that Zhang Da'gezi would fight with Scar A'Si on East Street and Jiu'er Mazi on West Street. And what he hoped for even more was that these two heroes would unite to beat Zhang Da'gezi. Two against one. Although Zhang Da'gezi is a hero, he can't avoid a "dog eats mud" moment. When Wang Xiao'er thought of this delightful point, he couldn't help but loosen his crossed arms and slapped his thigh hard, laughing loudly: "Good is rewarded with good, and evil is rewarded with evil, Zhang Da'gezi, you only know how to bully me, Wang Xiao'er, how come you're lying on the ground today, losing face." This is Wang Xiao'er's revenge plan that he thinks about day and night. Although whether Scar A'Si and Jiu'er Mazi will fall out with Zhang Da'gezi, whether they will unite to carry out two against one, and whether Zhang Da'gezi will really play "dog eats mud" are still uncertain when Wang Xiao'er is hiding in the corner of the door, Wang Xiao'er doesn't have any bigger plans other than that.</p>
<p>In society, typical characters like Wang Xiao'er can be found everywhere. Naturally, this is the easiest way to take revenge, which is a hundred times better than going to Mount Emei to cultivate and practice hard for three years before being able to take revenge. Furthermore, if Wang Xiao'er suffered a loss from Zhang Da'gezi and really went to practice martial arts and took revenge, it would seem too obvious, and people would laugh at him for "not being willing to suffer losses." Only by using this "understanding in the stomach" method and sticking to the hope of Zhang Da'gezi playing "dog eats mud," can he not only breathe a sigh of relief, but also say that set of "good is rewarded with good, and evil is rewarded with evil," which means that Yin and Yang have not disappeared, and justice still exists. This is the essence of the philosophy of life.</p>
<h3>Chrysanthemum</h3>
<p>— Jinlou</p>
<p>It's the season for chrysanthemums again! The beautiful image of cold elegance and no charm floats in my mind!</p>
<p>Indeed, chrysanthemums are very lovable, golden silk chrysanthemums, rouge chrysanthemums, large ink chrysanthemums, as well as Autumn Moon, Feather Rhododendron, Lion's Mane, Coral Hook... what moving names! Their graceful figures, set off by the dark green petals, beckon like beauties in the autumn sunlight, by the bamboo fence, by the pink wall... intoxicating the hearts of so many people?</p>
<p>"Picking chrysanthemums under the east fence, leisurely seeing the South Mountain," since ancient times, Chinese poets, in addition to liking to drink wine and watch the moon, have also had a very good relationship with chrysanthemums! Especially Tao Yuanming, he especially praised the "solitary fragrance in late autumn" of chrysanthemums, so later generations often regarded Tao Yuanming as the only confidant of chrysanthemums. But is it just Tao Yuanming? Since ancient times, poets have all lived in simple lives, yearning for the beauty of elegant nature, so chrysanthemums have never failed to be loved, praised, and chanted by a great poet, even Wang Anshi, who was the most officialistic, also had the line "Yellow chrysanthemum has supreme virtue, solitary fragrance defies the cold." The elegance of chrysanthemums can be seen from this!</p>
<p>However, times have changed now. Writers all take "there is literature only when there is a woman" as their motto, and ordinary new poets are also deeply influenced by the urban materialism of enjoyment, abandoning the acceptance of natural beauty, and plunging into the charming cafes and dance halls night after night, wanting to find their so-called "inspiration" in those white-uniformed waitresses and red-cheongsammed dancers! Therefore, what they chant is either the worship of "curvaceous beauty" or the eulogy of "leg beauty," the thick breath of flesh in it cannot be read. If chrysanthemums have knowledge, recalling those confidants like Tao Yuanming in ancient times, they have all been lost today! How can they not be sad? Everything has its ups and downs, this is probably the chrysanthemum's vicissitudes!</p>
<h3>Random Talk on Cartoons</h3>

<h3>Northeast Fourth Company Commander</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 18: Secretly Passing Tea, Bearing Sorrow to Comfort the Husband; Hastily Leaving the Frontier, Forcibly Smiling to Bid Farewell to the Family</p>
<p>These few words can also be regarded as his temporary feelings. It can also be said that he is lazy to act, and uses these words to excuse himself. But when these words reached Zhao Ziqiang's ears, his heart stirred. If he is so easily moved by emotion, there will be many more emotions. He pushed open the door and saw my family in the backyard. He wanted to be moved by emotion. Sitting in the house, he used to hear my footsteps passing through the front yard, but in the future, he won't anymore. These are all things he should recall, and it is inevitable that he will be moved by emotion. What can one say about this? Zhao Ziqiang thought of this, and everything was silent. He lowered his head and looked at his leather shoes, kicking the tips of his feet on the ground randomly. Gui Zhi had already poured a cup of tea, and then smiled and brought it to him. She said softly, don't be sad, drink this cup of hot tea. Zhao Ziqiang responded and suddenly stood up, taking his teacup with both hands and said to him: I have many things to say to you, but I can't remember for a moment, which sentence to start with. I am a soldier on active duty, my body belongs to the country, there is only order, no freedom, please forgive me. Gui Zhi smiled: You are overthinking, I didn't say I wouldn't forgive you. Zhao Ziqiang held the teacup, not knowing whether to drink or sit down, just staring blankly at people. Gui Zhi pursed her lips and smiled, for a long, long time, before saying: Don't be so pessimistic, a real man should always do something earth-shattering. Sit down and drink tea, don't think about those things. Zhao Ziqiang heard this, looked at him, and slowly sat down. Unintentionally, he had already moved away from the square stool. When he sat down, he didn't touch the stool. His body swayed, and he was almost about to fall down, but he thought that he was still holding a teacup in his hand, and it should not be broken. If it broke, it would be an ominous sign for the person leaving, so he pinched the cup hard, unwilling to let go, but the hot tea that spilled out of the teacup burned the skin on his hand to a purple color. His right hand really couldn't hold it anymore, so he sent the teacup to his left hand. (231)</p>
<p>Children's Paradise</p>
<h3>Several Simple Magic Tricks</h3>
<p>— Yin Feng</p>
<p>Sure Success in Guessing</p>
<p>This clever magic trick only requires a alarm clock and a pencil. If you can't find a alarm clock temporarily, you can use a pocket watch or a watch, but it's smaller and harder to see clearly. Now, assuming you are using a alarm clock, show it to the audience, and then ask them to elect one person to think of a number from one to twelve on the clock face, and secretly tell the audience. Then you tell him (that is, the person elected by the audience to think of a number) that: "Now I will use a pencil to tap on the clock face. When you see me tapping on a number, you add one to the number you are thinking of. For example, if you are thinking of six o'clock, then when my pencil taps on one o'clock, you add one and it becomes seven; I tap once, you add once, and when it reaches twenty, you shout stop, and I can know what number you are thinking of." This is very simple, as long as you remember clearly the number of times the pencil taps the numbers on the clock face. Remember the first seven taps, no matter what time the tap lands on, it doesn't matter. The eighth tap must land on twelve o'clock, the ninth tap must land on eleven o'clock, the tenth tap must land on ten o'clock, and so on in that order, until the person thinking of the number has added up to twenty and shouted stop. Then the time on the clock face that your pencil tip has landed on is the number that he is thinking of. It works every time, and you will be right every time.</p>
<p>Moving Coins</p>
<p>First, prepare twelve copper coins, place them on the table, arranged in a square, with four coins on each side; then say to the audience: "There are twelve copper coins here, arranged in a square, with four coins on each side. Now I want to change each side to five copper coins, and it will still be a square. You cannot add or subtract a single copper coin, that is, you can only move the position of the copper coins, but you cannot increase or decrease the number of copper coins. Can the audience do it?" If they say they can't think of it, they can't change it; then you say: "I'll change it for you to see." When changing, you just need to remember the order of the copper coins, that is, from the left hand side to the right hand side, it is the first to the fourth; then from top to bottom, it is the fifth to the seventh; then from right to left, it is the eighth to the tenth; then from bottom to top, it is the eleventh and the twelfth. Remembering the order of the copper coins makes it easy to change. Just move the fifth coin to the fourth coin and place it there; then move the second coin to the first coin and place it there; then move the eleventh coin to the tenth coin and place it there; then move the eighth coin to the seventh coin and place it there; then it becomes a square with five copper coins on each side, only moving the position, without increasing or decreasing the number.</p>
<p>Tying a Handkerchief</p>
<p>Borrow a handkerchief from the audience, and then teach any one of them to take the handkerchief and hold the two opposite corners of the handkerchief; that is, one hand holds one end. Then ask him to tie a knot, but he is not allowed to let go of the hand and loosen the handkerchief corner he is holding. If he doesn't know the secret of this trick, he won't be able to tie it no matter what; because to tie a knot in a handkerchief, you must cross the two corners of the handkerchief, and then turn one corner downwards and inwards to thread it through, in order to tie a knot. Now you are not allowed to let go, you cannot loosen it, and it is impossible to tie a knot. But it is easy for those who know magic. Little friends who want to be little magicians, why not give it a try. Just cross your two wrists over each other and place them in front of your chest, and then teach a viewer to thread one end of the handkerchief through the empty space in front of your chest behind your hands, and you hold it; for example, if your wrists are crossed, your right hand is inside and your left hand is outside, then you grab the end that is threaded through the intersection with your left hand, and hold the corner that is not threaded through with your right hand. Your wrists still have to be crossed and cannot be moved.) At this time, half of the handkerchief is inside and half is outside. Then you hold the two ends of the handkerchief, and pull your wrists back without crossing them, and the handkerchief is tied into a knot. Isn't that a knot tied without letting go of the two handkerchief corners that you are holding?</p>

<h3>Silver Dollar Collection Gradually Declines</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silver dollar exchange rate remained unchanged. The morning and afternoon markets both opened at 0.06 yuan. Initially, there was a transaction of 0.02 yuan, but it remained white, indicating ample liquidity. The morning session saw 4.2 million yuan in interbank transfers and over 500,000 yuan in new transactions. The afternoon session saw only 200,000 yuan in transactions, and 400,000 yuan in small association transactions.

Foreign banks collected 1.4 to 1.5 million yuan in checks and over 2 million yuan in silver dollars, 1.4 million yuan in special funds, and over 3 million yuan in various goods and exchange deposit funds and miscellaneous collections, along with over 4.1 million yuan in silver dollars. 200,000 yuan in silver was deposited, and 400,000 yuan in silver dollars were withdrawn.

<h3>Jiangsu Small Dollars Continue to Fall by 1.8 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Jiangsu small silver dollars weakened further. The morning and afternoon markets both traded at 830 yuan, a sharp drop of 1.8 yuan from the previous day's price.

<h3>Call Loan Interest Rate Increases by 0.5 Yuan</h3>
<p>This year's call loan interest rate has not been high, and has sometimes been very loose. Therefore, the total amount for the entire month is often less than the original fixed price of 2 yuan. As a result, the daily call loan interest rate is always discounted at 2.95 yuan, like a stereotypical article. However, last month (October) seemed more robust, with the total exceeding 2 yuan. Therefore, the current call loan market price decided by the Money Trade Association's standing committee meeting has been increased by 0.5 yuan, to 2.5 yuan with a discount of 0.95 yuan. However, overdue interest will still be charged at 4.5 yuan. If the interest remains past due, the rate will increase gradually. Thus, October's call loan interest was slightly better, but overdue interest remained the same as in the past.</p>
<p>Securities</p>
<h3>Bond Market Shows Initial Signs of Recovery</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the atmosphere at the Chinese Securities Exchange gradually improved, sweeping away the previous gloomy mood. The trend gradually became more active. This was because Finance Minister Kong stated that he had a solution for the financial situation. Today, the monthly swearing-in ceremony was held, and from now on, someone will be responsible for finance, which should reduce difficulties. It was also heard that new paths are being explored. Investor sentiment in the market turned firm, and the 4th company started buying first, with a strong appetite. At the morning opening, various companies made some purchases, but trading was not enthusiastic. The 4th company only bought Consolidated Tax Bonds, and the market price improved by 0.2-0.3 yuan. However, the 20% Bonds experienced heavier selling volume from the 21st company, with no gains or losses for this month. Next month is still down 0.25 yuan. In the second round, the 4th company continued to need Consolidated Salt Tax Bonds, and the previously listed disbandment and troop reduction bonds were flat. After that, they all saw continued improvement of 0.1-0.2 yuan. Sellers were scarce, and the trend was stable. In the afternoon, the 4th company's purchases were particularly strong. Retail investors, seeing the situation, also slightly covered their short positions. Most bond markets continued to rise by 0.1-0.2 yuan to over 0.4 yuan. The closing trend remained strong. The 4th company continued to have needs, which was reportedly handled by its savings society. The market remained firm, continuing to improve by around 0.2-0.3 yuan. The overall trend for the day was completely bullish. This is just the initial stage of the rebound. The number of transactions that can be counted has exceeded 50 million yuan. Although it is not possible to accurately determine the amount of speculation, it is estimated that more than one-third is speculative. The trend of market manipulation in the future is likely to be intense. Yesterday's market price results were uniformly up, ranging from 0.3-0.4 yuan to 1 yuan. The total transaction volume was 10,086,000 yuan, including 1,000 yuan in spot transactions, 4.15 million yuan in Consolidated Salt Tax Bonds futures, 1.26 million yuan in Disbandment Bonds, 1.12 million yuan in 1919 Customs Bonds, 2.24 million yuan in 20% Bonds, and the remainder ranging from tens of thousands to two or three hundred thousand.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Shows Good Progress</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Bank reported that the New York stock market on the 3rd was showing an upward trend. Although there was no special news to trigger the rally, the weakness of the US dollar and the rise in gold prices, as well as the US purchasing gold in France, which some considered a precursor to monetary expansion, and the market rumors of positive announcements from Washington, gradually pushed the market higher. Trading also became more active. The total trading volume for the day was 1.5 million shares. Observing the government's determination to raise prices, "wheat" is still expected to rise due to a lack of sellers and the government's intention to set prices. It seems possible to make purchases on corrections. "Cotton" is firm due to the influence of the stock market and the US dollar. It is expected that once the government's estimate is announced, it will be able to respond to positive news from all sides. Southern farmers are gradually increasing their borrowing at 0.1 yuan per pound, and hedging sales are decreasing as a result. The closing price of "silver" remained firm. The Financial Stability Agency announced the price of gold at 32.57 yuan per tael, up 0.21 yuan. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left:</p>

<h3>Cold and Quiet Marked Yarn Auction</h3>
<p>The yarn market is stable, but trading is extremely quiet, and no one is showing any excitement. After a large amount was absorbed by a certain association, the environment is poor, but new sellers are not making rash moves. As a result, business is quite smooth, and a deadlock has formed. The daily fluctuation range is within 0.05 yuan, so many empty lots are auctioned.</p>
<h3>Numerous Empty Lots in the Auction</h3>
<p>At the opening of the yarn auction, the market was flat, but there were some large purchases, and the market tightened slightly. Prices for each month rose and fell by 0.01, 0.02, and 0.03 yuan. In the afternoon, it was heard that demand for raw yarn was still good, and prices for each month rose and fell by 0.01, 0.02, and 0.03 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 10,600 bales. Daji sold 800 bales, Yukang sold 850 bales, Lichang sold 500 bales, Tongxing sold 600 bales, and Yuantai sold 850 bales. Yuanda bought 3,800 bales, Ruidai bought 1,600 bales, and Tongxing bought 300 bales. The closing prices are as follows:</p>

<p>Total 254,200</p>
<h3>Yarn Sales Increase Compared to Previous Day</h3>
<p>Raw yarn sales were higher than yesterday. Statistics for the day show that various companies bought a total of 1,325 bales. Prices were slightly firmer. The purchase amounts for each company are as follows: Guangdong 65, Northern 20, Shantou 10, Ningbo 15, Anqing 40, Wuhu 5, Sichuan 825, Luzhou 20, Mainland 315, Xuzhou 5, Nanjing 5.</p>
<h3>Soft Cotton Auction</h3>
<p>The cotton market is showing signs of softening because Indian cotton prices are falling, exchange prices are declining, and raw cotton selling prices are weakening. However, good-quality cotton is still scarce, and prices remain high. The cotton market has the potential to fall, but because there are no enthusiastic buyers and the transaction volume in the cotton auction market is too large, it is difficult for prices to fall significantly.</p>
<h3>Zheng Cotton Auction Weakens</h3>
<p>At the opening of the Zheng cotton auction, the market was still flat, but the situation was softening. Prices for each month fell by 0.05 yuan. In the afternoon, there were long position liquidations, and prices for each month fell by 0.1-0.15 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 43,200 dan. Yuanda sold 2,200 dan, Gengfeng sold 3,100 dan, Xiesheng sold 1,000 dan, Daji sold 2,000 dan, Chunji sold 1,400 dan, Tongxing sold 1,900 dan, Yongchang sold 1,400 dan, Xinheng sold 2,700 dan, and Yuchang sold 2,400 dan. Jifeng bought 2,700 dan, Taixing bought 2,400 dan, Yuanxingchang bought 4,000 dan, Renfeng bought 1,300 dan, Tonghe bought 1,000 dan, and Ruiyuan bought 1,000 dan.

<p>Rangoon Cotton 38.25 Shenxin Factory Received 500 bales Immediate Loading</p>
<h3>US Cotton Maintains a Quiet and Firm Situation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton was quiet and firm due to scarce domestic arrivals, strength on Wall Street, and a lack of sellers. As a result, spot prices rose by 5 basis points, and futures prices rose by 6-8 basis points. Liverpool cotton spot prices fell by 3 points, and futures prices rose by 1 point. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 1 point. The Bombay cotton market fell due to selling by European exporters and long position liquidations. As a result, Pinggar fell by 1 rupee and 7.5 corners, Aomula fell by 2 rupees and 7.5 corners, and Bai Luoxi fell by 1 rupee and 8.75 corners.

<h3>Majority Expected Increase in US Cotton Estimates</h3>
<p>A New York dispatch from November 3rd reports on the cotton market situation for the week, stating that the US government's announcement of entering the global gold market initially caused some buying in raw cotton at the beginning of the week. The market then showed a bright but uneven appearance. Merchants were waiting to see the development of the authorities' gold purchase policy and its impact on prices, as well as waiting for the release of the US cotton production report on November 8th. Private cotton production estimates averaged around 13.5 million bales, so the majority expected the government estimate to be slightly higher than before. This uncertain situation also hindered transactions. At the same time, it was generally believed that the implementation of monetary policy and the general degree of recovery would be the main factors dominating the final cotton price. News from the South indicated that the raw cotton market was tight, as more cotton farmers were visibly accepting loans and signing up for the next season's cotton acreage reduction program than before. Cotton trading was sluggish, but the cloth market remained stable.</p>
<p>Grain</p>
<h3>Flour and Wheat Fall with Increasing Momentum</h3>
<p>The flour market sentiment is very weak because a considerable amount of foreign wheat has been traded in recent days. Factories have ample stocks, and there are also pre-ordered wheat shipments yet to arrive. Statistics show that their chips are increasing, so major factories are planning to hedge their positions. However, actual sales are sluggish, and they are unable to hoard and hedge. Factories find it difficult to see a large outlet for their flour stocks in the short term. However, if there are more foreign wheat transactions today and tomorrow, the market will need to move downstream. Moreover, the amount of US wheat borrowed on credit is substantial and must be fully collected. At present, only a small number are buying and distributing to various factories. In the future, there must be further inflows and outflows, and the market will need to wait for large companies to digest their stocks before a turnaround can occur. Yesterday, guest sales were very sluggish, and the market fell. The closing price for this month was down 0.0125 yuan, next month was down 0.015 yuan, January was down 0.01 yuan, February was down 0.0075 yuan, March was down 0.0125 yuan, and April was down 0.0175 yuan.</p>
<p>The wheat market opened lower because the market sentiment was extremely weak after a large amount of foreign wheat was traded. Brokers were still trying their best to hedge their positions. Long positions were watching, and short positions were adding to their positions. Short covering was also waiting for a further decline before making inquiries. As a result, the market gradually trended downward, and the afternoon saw a further decline. The closing price for this month was down 0.05 yuan, December was down 0.03 yuan, January was down 0.06 yuan, February was down 0.03 yuan, April was down 0.03 yuan. The city opened with Shandong wheat at 3.8 yuan, second grade at 3.76 yuan, Gao Deng wheat at 3.7 yuan, 3.8 yuan, second grade at 3.75 yuan, and Pudong wheat at 3.45 yuan, for a total of 3,000 bales, which were all taken by Gao Feng.</p>
<h3>North and South Rice Markets are Both Stable</h3>
<p>(Hu Nan) The source was number 30-40, with a total of 4,500-6,000 shi. The sales of Su Tong japonica rice to regular buyers were slightly less than 1,000 shi compared to yesterday, so the market situation has turned stable. As for Qingjiao and other brands taken by the bao wei, since it was difficult to declare on Saturday, the amount was only around 1,000 packages, so the market situation was still stable. Du Yangjian was also flat, while the sales of thick rice from Hong Kong and other regions were 1,500-6,000 shi, and the market was slightly tighter, but prices only fluctuated by a few points. Various broken japonica rice were scarce and firm, and the Yin Yuan brand was stable.</p>
<p>(Hu Bei) The source was number 42-43, and the market continued to sell. New japonica rice was tight and close to the ruler in the morning market, but turned stable in the afternoon market. Broken rice was slightly weak. Various Zhong Bagger Yin Yuan were stable, Chen Bian Yuan was flat and weak, and New Bian Yuan prices were weak by 0.1-0.2 yuan. New Yang Du Bu guest xiang rice prices remained stable.</p>
<h3>Foreign Guest Xiang Rice Sales Halted</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign guest xiang rice market was even more sluggish, and guest buyers completely stopped buying. Local sellers seized the opportunity, and prices fell by nearly 0.1 yuan again. The city sold 424 bags of Jiang Si Ji late rice and New Late Rice at 7.67 yuan and Chen Late Rice at 7.55 yuan to the local merchants, all of which were sold to local merchants. Guest buyers were all watching. Fujian already had a large inventory, and Guangdong was directly arranging for loading in Hunan and Anhui provinces, so sales were even more sluggish.</p>
<h3>Railway Station Increases Miscellaneous Grain Storage Fees</h3>
<p>Grain transported by rail has a seven-day grace period for storage fees according to previous regulations. After that, the fee is 0.015 yuan per ton per day. Yesterday, the Miscellaneous Grain Association suddenly issued an announcement stating that it had received a letter from the stationmaster of McGruer Road stating that according to a telegram from the Vehicle Affairs Office, starting this month, the new regulations for storage fees would be implemented. The new regulations state that goods arriving at the station have a five-day grace period, and after that, the fee is 0.05 yuan per ton per day for a full carload. If the carload is less than a ton, the fee is 0.01 yuan per 50 kilograms. According to this, the fee will increase threefold compared to the previous regulations, which will likely have a significant impact on future market prices. The industry must hold a meeting immediately to discuss this.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Flour Transported to Guandong</h3>
<p>In the past two weeks, the quantity of flour transported from this port to Guandong has reached more than 100,000 bags. The reason for this is that the weather has been getting colder recently, and Andong, Yingkou, and other places are at risk of icing over. Once frozen, waterway transportation will be blocked until the spring, when it will recover. During this icy period, merchants must prepare goods and food in advance to supply the market. Therefore, Northern foreign guest merchants stationed in Shanghai are rushing to transport goods, with flour being the main item. It is reported that there will be another 180,000 bags of flour loaded on two ships to be transported to Yingkou today. It is estimated that there will be another 100,000 bags waiting to be transported next week.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea</p>
<h3>No Turnaround Hoped for in Raw Silk Sales to Europe and America</h3>
<p>(New York Raw Silk Prices Still Low) Although the U.S. government has repeatedly tried to raise prices and stabilize the dollar, the global economic panic continues, rendering these efforts largely ineffective. The U.S. dollar is expected to fluctuate again soon. Moreover, with no resolution in sight for the labor strike at New York silk mills, the raw silk market has collapsed. Coupled with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, the prices for Chinese raw silk are increasingly low. While Grade B white filature silk can still fetch $1.50 (U.S.) per pound, the equivalent price in Chinese currency is only over 550 yuan per bale. The prospects for Chinese raw silk sales to the U.S. are becoming increasingly bleak.</p>
<p>(Over Three Hundred Pieces of Silk Waste Shipped to France) The French postal ship "Isles" departed yesterday, carrying a total of three hundred and eighty-three pieces of white silk waste from various local silk businesses, destined for Marseilles, Angers, and other ports.</p>
<p>(Large Quantities of Artificial Silk Shipped Inland) The artificial silk that various local "Zhun Xing" firms should have turned over to Chinese merchants last month is now being shipped out in batches. In the past three days alone, shipments of American artificial silk via water routes to Qingdao, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Huzhou, Jiaxing, and various ports along the Yangtze River have reached 738 cases.</p>
<p>(Foreign Firms' Silk Market Has Reached an Impasse) Overseas markets have been unsettled by unfavorable rumors circulating in Washington, leading to foreign exchange instability. New York and Lyon have ample silk inventories, and silk trading has become illiquid. Yokohama's Japanese raw silk prices have plummeted drastically, reaching new lows. Foreign firms in Shanghai are adopting a wait-and-see approach, and silk sales have reached an impasse. Yesterday, only twenty-seven bales of grey and yellow silk were traded, with prices remaining weak and flat.</p>
<h3>"Zhen Mei" and "Xiu Mei" Teas See Slight Sales Increase</h3>
<p>Yesterday, local foreign firms dealing in tea saw sales of "Zhen Mei" and "Xiu Mei" green teas from both "Lu Zhuang" and "Tu Zhuang" sources. Companies like Tongfu, Tianxiang, and Xiehe all purchased, with total sales reaching over 320 chests at a price of 26-27 yuan per chest. This price remained relatively stable compared to previous days. For items such as "Zhen Mei" and "Gong Xi," British and Indian firms also sent out orders for several hundred chests via telegram. However, the sales of Keemun black tea remained exceptionally sluggish.</p>

<p>Amateur Musings</p>
<h3>Are Humans Worse Than Beasts?</h3>
<p>— Gongpu</p>
<p>A week ago, this reporter took the time to attend a lecture at the Chinese Arts and Crafts Society given by a "Haijingbo" circus troupe's expert animal trainer on "How to Train Wild Animals." Ten days prior, I had also spent six big silver coins to see a circus performance, and I was deeply impressed by how well-trained many of the wild animals were, how obedient they were, how they followed rules, and how they maintained discipline as a group. I deeply admired the trainer's methods and regretted not knowing anything about how to train wild animals. Therefore, upon learning of the lecture at the Arts and Crafts Society, I resolved to attend. The result was very satisfying and thought-provoking.</p>
<p>The animal trainer's speech mainly described the personalities of various animals. He said that sea lions are the most obedient of all animals, while horses, contrary to what we might think, are very difficult to teach. Other wild animals like lions, tigers, bears, and elephants also have their own individual personalities and characteristics. The most important thing to keep in mind when training them is not to teach them actions that go against their personalities. Instead, you must build on their unique characteristics to develop their personalities. This is the first principle that anyone training wild animals should know.</p>
<p>Next, he discussed training methods, saying that you must have patience and follow the teaching methods, drawing on your personal experience, to gradually implement basic movements, complex training, and continuous practice until they are proficient and make no mistakes. But the main point is to be clear on reward and punishment, and the trainer must fully gain the trust of each animal. However, gaining this trust is not easy. You must constantly make the animal pay attention to your actions, so that it can gradually understand the trainer's love, and then you can train it in various performance techniques. This is the second principle of animal training.</p>
<p>After listening to this animal trainer's speech, I had many thoughts and doubts. First, I deeply felt that "Haijingbo" and others are not only animal training experts, but are educators in every sense of the word. We know that the various animal training principles described above are not different from the principles of many modern educators. The difference is that these principles can be applied to animals that are unreasonable and whose wild nature can erupt at any moment, whereas the education of human beings, the so-called "lords of all creation," does not fully adopt these two major principles of developing personality and gaining trust. In fact, there are many methods that fundamentally violate these principles in the schools that educate our people. Another difference is that if the animal training expert does not follow these educational principles, the animals will not be trained, will resist, and the circus cannot be performed, fundamentally violating the purpose of doing business. As for the purpose of modern school education, it is to educate young people to adapt to the environment of the existing political and social system, and to develop personality and freedom of belief. Although these are the educational principles that should be implemented, they are not suitable for the current environment and system. Therefore, although the educational principle of developing human personality is reasonable, it cannot be put into practice!</p>
<p>If we further ask why the educational principle of developing personality is not suitable for the current political and social system, the question is very simple. It is because the current system is largely built on a foundation of inequality. Human personalities always oppose inequality. Therefore, the more fully human personalities are developed, the more intense the resistance to the unequal system will be. Those who want to maintain the unequal system understand this key point very well, so they apply the principle of developing personality very carefully, and they are unwilling to lightly attempt it and tie their own hands. As for why this kind of education that violates personality cannot be applied to animals but can only be applied to humans, it is because human personality, although strong, is hidden very deep, and it requires full education and environmental enlightenment to be developed and expanded. Therefore, except for a few people who are born with slightly stronger personalities or who have been stimulated by special environments, most people are easily dominated by the environment and material things, and become a part of the existing environment, becoming characters without personality and without belief.</p>
<p>There is also a small feeling that "docility is not necessarily intelligence." We see that horses are more docile than many wild animals, but their intelligence is not very high. Nowadays, there are some people who hate people with personality and praise the unambitious and submissive, or the so-called docile. If this continues, it will ultimately turn all Chinese people into horses. However, horses are not valued in the eyes of animal training experts, because they are unintelligent fools whose personalities or wildness have been submerged!</p>
<h3>The No-Marriage Doctrine of 30,000 Female Workers in the Outer Postal Agency</h3>
<p>— Translated by Ms. Shuangping</p>
<p>Correspondence from Shunde, Guangdong</p>
<p>In my rural life, what I hate most every morning is the siren of the silk factory. Little did I know that this siren is a symbol of the life of the women in the whole village.</p>
<p>Speaking of silk factories, there are more than a hundred in our south, with an average of six to seven hundred female workers crammed into each one.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>They endure the torture of foul air from morning till night, sitting upright on a stool, facing a pot of boiling water and a pot of cold water. Their backs are close to the hot pipes. Their hands, scalded by boiling water, are attacked by cold water again and again. Therefore, their hands are always wrinkled like a monkey's face, and rough like rose branches. Their faces are pale from the sweat, their lips are blue-black, and their wet clothes stick tightly to their bodies and cannot be taken off. Especially, their eyes are surrounded by smoke and cannot see clearly, so they become useless in middle age. Their eyes have to follow the running silk thread. If they are not careful, and there is one more or one less cocoon, the silk thread will be thick or thin, and you can forget about getting your full wages. In front is water vapor, and behind is heat, creating a "climate that is different in one's own body." The young ladies and ladies who only know how to dress in red and green will never realize the hardships of the owners of the manufactured goods!</p>
<p>The factory owners' harsh punishments are truly countless! The factory's penalty rules are as follows: work starts at 6:00 AM every day. If you are ten minutes late to the factory, you will be locked out. It is bad enough that you won't get paid for the day, but to deduct one day's wages as a warning is the most unreasonable thing! As for the harsh punishments for silk that is reeled too thick or too thin, they are beyond description. If you argue even slightly, you will be unconditionally dismissed. After being dismissed, the factory will send a notice to all the neighboring factories. At this time, the dismissed female worker must either leave her hometown to look for work, or she will be unemployed forever!</p>
<p>Secondly, the foremen's barbaric oppression and insults are also commonplace for the female workers. If you are young and beautiful, or good at flattering, then no matter how thick or thin your silk is reeled, you will never be penalized; but those old women and female workers with pale faces must always be careful about losing their jobs. Even if they are not unemployed when the cocoons are on the market, the unreasonable harsh punishments and the foremen's bestial insults are already enough to make them suffer! Ah! The foremen know how to enjoy themselves. They often seek the pleasure of the female workers—playing with them, stroking their faces and breasts!</p>
<p>They have no courage to resist at all, but sometimes they are oppressed to the point of being abnormal—such as when the foremen take brooms and firewood to beat the female workers, then, as the saying goes, "Even the Buddha will strike fire." They swarm together like bees to make a disturbance, or rush to the machine room to turn off the main switch—called "stirring up the clams," or cut off all the silk on the machines—called "bamboo silk chicken." But no matter what kind of commotion they make, it can only last for five minutes. When the factory issues a threatening announcement, they swarm back to that terrible living hell—the factory. This is a self-employment introduction return.</p>
<p>Ms. Pu: Please come to No. 4 Daxilu between 2:00 PM and 4:00 PM every day to contact Ms. Li. (Initiated by the Shanghai Tuberculosis Sanatorium Main Branch)</p>
<p>Because there are only a few silk factories in one or several villages, the female workers who cannot leave their hometowns have to submit! Those who do not return to work are only those female workers who have been injured, lying in bed groaning, and have no money to seek medical treatment. Especially unfortunate are those who have been dismissed by the factory on some pretext!</p>
<p>They have a strange idea and doctrine, which is the no-marriage doctrine. The 60,000+ female workers cannot avoid being influenced by feudal heredity. Except for those who have to support their parents and children, the rest, whose families are a little more economically sound, will accumulate their daily wages. These people are also the ones who adhere to the no-marriage doctrine, accounting for 50-60% of the total number of female workers. The reasons why they do not marry are: first, the continuation of customs; second, they are economically independent. Therefore, even if some female workers have been married off by their parents, they will still try their best to get rid of it, which is called "not falling into the family." Some will also take their accumulated sweat and blood wages to redeem their bodies.</p>
<p>Each of those unmarried female workers has a same-sex lover; they live together as if they were husband and wife, or a dozen or more female workers live together in a house (commonly known as a "grandma's house"). In short, the female workers' adherence to celibacy is nothing more than a reflection of their oppression by capitalist society.</p>
<p>Life</p>
<h3>I Murdered Someone</h3>
<p>— Gushui</p>
<p>The Unemployed</p>
<p>My state of mind is unusually empty, and I can't seem to think about anything. If I were to furrow my brow and think all day about how to deal with my problems, perhaps my mind would become numb and fall into a state of madness. So, recently, I have been confining myself in a small room, abandoning all painful thoughts, and living a life of self-deception. My heart is as dark as a zombie.</p>
<p>That afternoon, my friend Qingshan appeared in my room with a smile. I was annoyed that he was disturbing the peace of my soul, but he immediately burst out, "Mr. Zhu called me and told me to let you know that a clerk is needed somewhere, with a monthly salary of thirty-five yuan. Do you want to do it?"</p>
<p>My heart, which had been dull and gloomy for a long time due to unemployment, suddenly lit up as if it had seen a glimmer of light. I became excited and asked, "Is it true? What did Mr. Zhu say?"</p>
<p>"He told you to think it over first and go see him tonight. I think this job is doable. Anyway, you're just sitting around doing nothing. It's good to earn thirty or forty yuan a month."</p>
<p>"Okay, but being a clerk is also a very hard job!"</p>
<p>"There's no way around it. It's really not easy to make a living these days!"</p>
<p>So my friend went back, leaving me with this small amount of joy and luck.</p>
<p>That night, I hired a rickshaw to go to Mr. Zhu's place. He was my teacher when I studied at a school before. Because I had a very good relationship with him at that time, he has always cared about me since I left that school and wandered for three years. This time, I came to Shanghai from afar again. On the day I first arrived, I visited his home. He treated me to a meal and even specially bought two catties of aged wine to drink with me. His sincere feelings for me have really changed from a teacher-student relationship to a friendship.</p>
<p>When I entered his house, I was greeted by Mrs. Zhu, who greeted me warmly like a kind mother and led me to Mr. Zhu's room. When Mr. Zhu saw me, he asked, "Did Qingshan tell you?"</p>
<p>"He told me, but I'm afraid this job will be very hard, right?"</p>
<p>"It's nothing much, probably just drafting some documents and copying things every day."</p>
<p>"What kind of work will he be doing? How much will he be able to earn a month?" Mrs. Zhu also asked Mr. Zhu with concern.</p>
<p>"A clerk somewhere, with a monthly salary of thirty-five yuan."</p>
<p>"Asking him to do such a humble thing is too unsuitable!"</p>
<p>"Sigh, what can we do! Nowadays, it's difficult to earn this much! To tell you the truth, there are four or five people who have asked me to recommend them for this position, and there are more than a dozen who have written letters to apply for it themselves. You really don't know how many people there are looking for a job these days. There are as many as crucian carp crossing the river."</p>
<p>"With Gu Jun's talent, it's a pity to do this kind of thing."</p>
<p>"Although it's a pity, there's no way around it. It's dangerous if you don't find a way to make a living first. Future hopes will have to come slowly. Nowadays, I don't know how many people like you are being suppressed by the times in this social stratum!"</p>
<p>"I don't think it's a pity at all. If you don't have food to eat, what hope and future are you allowed to talk about?"</p>
<p>"Then you can go to the office tomorrow. I'll give you this business card so they can recognize you when you get there. Be careful about everything and do your duty first. Let's talk about it after you've worked for a while."</p>
<p>So I said goodbye and left. After spending a relatively pleasant night, I changed into a more presentable set of clothes the next morning and went to the office.</p>
<p>When I arrived, I handed Mr. Zhu's business card to a man with a pair of large glasses, a handlebar mustache, and a large cigar in his mouth. He said very nicely and asked me to sit down at a desk and pointed out many things to me. For a moment, my desk was filled with files, official papers, draft books... many unfamiliar things. That was considered the start of my work.</p>
<p>The man then brought over more than a dozen letters, saying that they were all applications from people who wanted to take my position, and asked me to reply to them one by one. I read them all through one by one. I was stunned for a moment. It was as if there were more than a dozen sorrowful faces, faces that seemed to be expecting something, all looking down on me. I also seemed to see that all of them were followed by a group of wives and children, people who had been crushed by the pressure of life. As I wrote letters to reply to these people, I felt as if I had become a murderer, and a few tears couldn't help but well up in my eyes.</p>
<p>At five o'clock in the afternoon, I left the office and slowly walked home, my heart feeling as if it was carrying a thousand pounds of pain, and my throat felt as if something was stuck in it.</p>
<p>"Shanghai in 1933 is a place full of tragedies, and China in 1933 is a country covered in suffering—" I thought to myself, and muttered, "Thirty-five, thirty-five..."</p>
<p>On Words</p>
<h3>Is It Possible Not To Work For Japanese Employers?</h3>
<p>— Chen Caiyun</p>
<p>Several months ago, whenever I passed by the new site of the Japanese Marines headquarters on Jiangwan Road, which was under construction, and saw many of my compatriots working under the supervision of Japanese soldiers carrying guns, I couldn't help but think of this not-so-small question: "Why do they have to work for the enemy?" Of course, I believe that anyone with even a little bit of backbone would feel the seriousness of this question! Or some people might say: "These people are all laborers and have not received any education, so they lack a concept of the nation!" However, I can assert that there are quite a few of our educated compatriots who work for Japanese employers; and it is not only in one corner of Shanghai that this is the case, but also in Tianjin, Qingdao, Hankou... In short, in any commercial port where the Japanese have influence, this phenomenon can be found everywhere!</p>
<p>We don't need to talk about those traitors and unscrupulous merchants who have lost all conscience, but those compatriots who work for the Japanese are definitely not all without conscience, right? They wouldn't all recognize the enemy as their father, right? So, what is the reason why they work for the Japanese?</p>
<p>Once, I happened to ask a Chinese person working in a Japanese agency this question, and his answer was: "If I don't work for the Japanese, will society give me food to eat?" This sentence sounds a bit unreasonable, but upon careful consideration, there is some reason in it. If he leaves his Japanese employer, there will be people in society who ridicule him, but there will be no one who sympathizes with him. Even if there are, they will only be those who are "willing but unable" individuals! As a result, he can only join the ranks of the unemployed! Therefore, if society cannot find a way to solve their livelihood problems, it cannot but blame them for their actions!</p>
<p>I am not defending my compatriots who work in Japanese companies, nor am I encouraging people to work for the enemy. I am only hoping that society can do more to help this kind of person. Patriotism is a duty that everyone should fulfill, but no one can love their country on an empty stomach!</p>

<h3>Soviet Humanism</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>In the Soviet Union's first five-year plan, the development of waterways occupied a very important position. The Soviet Union has a vast land area with crisscrossing rivers, and there are many large rivers that flow for thousands of miles. The extensive use and transformation of old waterways and the excavation of many new waterways will open up many new areas for national industrialization; for the large-scale transportation of bread, raw materials, kerosene, machinery, building materials, etc., it will open up many new roads, and it will create more favorable conditions for the economic and cultural construction of various border areas and backward areas. The completion of the first five-year plan has given the Soviet Union a new look, and has brought about great changes in the Soviet Union's waterways. One of the largest engineering projects for artificial canals in the five-year plan was the excavation of the White Sea-Baltic Sea Canal.</p>
<p>This canal connects the two seas—the Baltic Sea and the White Sea—and is 227 kilometers long. In November 1931, the Soviet government decided to dig this canal and entrusted the work to the State Political Security Bureau. This was the starting point for the excavation of the White Sea-Baltic Sea Canal. At the end of June of this year, Yegoda, the deputy chairman of the State Political Security Bureau, made a report to the Soviet government on the creation of this artificial canal:</p>
<p>"The White Sea-Baltic Sea Canal, which began construction at the end of November 1931, has been completed by June 20, 1933. This means that the creation of a very large canal only took one year and nine months.</p>
<p>The People's Committee of Waterways has carefully examined all the equipment of the White Sea-Baltic Sea Canal, and all the dikes, sluice gates, hydro-electric technology, etc. have been done very well. Now the Soviet People's Committee of Waterways has accepted the White Sea-Baltic Sea Canal from the Political Security Bureau and has included the canal in the Soviet Union's navigable waterways. From now on, the Soviet Union has added a new waterway.</p>
<p>The success of this canal has shortened the distance to the Soviet Union's most important northern ports by four times. Previously, the sea route from Leningrad to Arkhangelsk was 2,840 nautical miles long. Now, thanks to the success of this canal, the sea route has been shortened to 674 miles. In addition, previously, to go from the Baltic Sea to the White Sea, it was necessary to pass through the ports of many countries, and to travel along the coast of Scandinavia. Now, thanks to the success of this canal, Soviet ships in the north can completely navigate domestic waterways without having to pass through foreign seaports. The success of this canal has provided convenient access for the development of the north's forests, timber, minerals, and natural resources, and has greatly promoted the development of the north's productive forces."</p>
<p>In the socialist Soviet Union, the speed of development of productive forces is unimaginable to any capitalist country. Due to the rapid development of productive forces, the demand for waterway transportation has also increased dramatically; therefore, the Soviet Union pays more attention to the development of waterway transportation than capitalist countries.</p>

<h3>Individualism in Modern Society</h3>
<p>— Zhu Anshi</p>
<p>Individualism is a product of the private ownership system. Human society, since the collapse of primitive communism, soon established the dominance of private ownership. Through the feudal society to the modern capitalist society, everything is built on this private ownership system, with private ownership as the foundation. Therefore, individualism has become the focus of these societies. However, in the feudal era, because social relations were not complex, although serfs were subordinate to the lords and became vassals, the lords still guaranteed the lives of serfs to a considerable extent. Therefore, the color of individualism was not very strong. But in the capitalist era, the situation is completely different. Not only are social relations very complex, but the existence of only exploitative relationships between individuals. Besides, the so-called freedom is just the freedom of private property. In short, at this time, individualism is not only very obvious, but also exceptionally developed.</p>
<p>Therefore, individualism is the principle of modern capitalist social organization. It is individual-oriented and individual-centered. It only recognizes the individual as the only real thing, and society is just a means to achieve individual goals. Thus, it fundamentally ignores the organic relationship between individuals and believes in the independent existence of individuals. As a result, all social rights become a clearly defined inviolable territory of individuals.</p>
<p>This concept is the direct opposite of the so-called socialism based on society. Because the standpoint of social centrism recognizes society as the only real thing, it does not recognize the independent existence of the individual. Moreover, the individual is only meaningful as part of the entire society, and the individual's purpose should also be integrated into the purpose of society. Therefore, if the economic organization is constructed under this principle, then the society has the responsibility to guarantee the economic life of each individual member, and in order to achieve this goal, a public agency is established to manage the production and distribution of social wealth. Therefore, this kind of social relationship is a rational social relationship.</p>
<p>However, in an individualistic, individual-centered society, society does not recognize the necessity of guaranteeing the economic life of each individual. The production of wealth is based on the individual's intentions, and the distribution is also based on the individual's intentions. This leads to the so-called free individual behavior of mutual exchange and buying and selling. Therefore, the economic activities of each individual in this society are not dominated by conscious and planned, but are individualistic activities conscious of their own economic interests. Each individual is based on his own position, without interfering with each other, and cannot be violated by others. It can be said that they stand on a relationship of mutual antagonism, opposition, and competition. Society itself is also generated as a result of this individual conscious activity. Therefore, individualism can be said to be the essence of modern society.</p>
<p>However, in this kind of society that is individual-oriented and recognizes its own selfish activities, and embraces liberalism towards the pursuit of profit, the result is the absence of control over production and distribution, an economic anarchy. At the same time, it causes the result of economic chaos in society, and allows the economically superior to dominate and exploit the economically weak almost endlessly. That is to say, capitalists, based on their individualistic selfishness and greed, not only extend the working hours, but also try their best to make the workers do strenuous labor to satisfy their private desires. Therefore, the economic freedom of activity and the private property system deny the right to survival of the members of society. All the miserable things such as unemployment, hunger, and crime will accompany the development of capitalism, and the economic panic that comes with the development will become more and more serious.</p>

<p>Career Exploration</p>
<h3>Personality and Vocational Success</h3>
<p>— Dr. He Qingru's Lecture, Notes by Zhang Shugeng</p>
<p>There are two major factors in the constitution of a career: (1) People, (2) Things. Vocational success must first have the matching of "people" and "things." Doing one thing to the highest degree can be said to be vocational success.</p>
<p>To reach the realm of vocational success, personality must be paid attention to the most. I often see many people who are a pity, because their lack of personality makes their career fail. There are many practical examples that can be found among our relatives and friends, either because of a bad temper, or because of a bad personality, or because of incompatibility with colleagues, which hinders him from continuing to serve.</p>
<p>Personality is a term that combines the reaction to "people" and to "things." What is his attitude towards me, what is my attitude towards him? What is his behavior towards me, what is my behavior towards him? Personality is not a single term, but a term composed of language, behavior, attitude, and concept.</p>
<p>Which personalities are successful? Everyone has different classifications, and there are more than dozens or hundreds of kinds. I will not be able to finish speaking for days. Now I will bring up and discuss a few kinds that are most related to success and do not contradict the road to success:</p>
<p>(1) Creation To succeed in a career, you must have a personality to create a career. For example, a carpenter became rich by making chairs, so the second, third, and fourth people set up factories to make chairs, which ruined the chair market. In fact, if you find a new path, you can also achieve the same victory as him. My meaning is not to not be the same as others, but not to be the same as others in everything without creating "new" methods.</p>
<p>(2) Sincerity It doesn't mean that not lying is sincerity; sincerity is like doing one thing, no matter how big or small, there will always be a result, and one point of effort will always have one point of result. Do everything seriously, whether it is big or small, serious will get a good result, and not serious will get a bad result; you must take into account the relationship of cause and effect, and do not do things sloppily. It is impossible to want to gain without working, or to want to do it in the easiest way. One point of labor, one point of price; you must use labor in the right place and concentrate on one thing.</p>
<p>(3) Experiment There are many things that need to be tried many times to get their results, even hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of times. Ordinary things cannot be successful once, so you must have an experimental attitude. The spirit of experimentation is very related to vocational success.</p>
<p>(4) Cooperation There are two necessities that a person must deal with when working outside: (A) natural forces, (B) man-made forces, and they must cooperate with them to succeed. For example, if a construction engineer does not cooperate with natural forces, such as using raw materials without investigating the climate and terrain, his work will definitely fail; if he does not cooperate with the foremen, he will not be able to build successfully.</p>
<p>To develop personality, it is necessary to have the corresponding preparations to be done: (1) Take a look at myself, analyze myself, what are my strengths? What are my weaknesses? What are my specialties? What am I lacking? (2) Analyze what kind of personality is needed in the job I want to do, and then compare the two aspects to see what I lack and what I am good at, so that I can talk about development.</p>

<h3>Mussolini's Youth (4)</h3>
<p>— Ms. Yan Jingcao</p>
<p>"Are you okay?" the policeman asked him.</p>
<p>"Are you okay?" he also asked the policeman.</p>
<p>"What are you doing here?" the policeman said.</p>
<p>"I'm guarding the printing equipment, you know that!" he said.</p>
<p>"Get up!" The policeman's face suddenly became stern, and Mussolini had no choice but to yawn a few times and follow the policeman away.</p>
<p>In this way, Mussolini entered the prison. In a small detention center, accompanied by an old, disabled, and filthy criminal, he spent several days of carefree and unfree life.</p>
<p>Long-term wandering gradually made Mussolini's thinking tend towards revolution. He arrived in Geneva, where he spent a lot of time, and was able to associate with writers and politicians. These people all admired his talent, ambition, and perseverance, so they were happy to associate with him. At that time, he could often write articles for Swiss and Italian magazines, and sometimes give speeches on socialism and international affairs. Not only did he win the sympathy of the labor class, but also intellectuals were moved by his words. At this time, he had already begun to attack "democracy", so the Swiss authorities paid close attention to his actions and secretly monitored him at any time.</p>
<p>However, Mussolini did not hide the sharpness of his thoughts and words because of the surveillance of the Swiss government. His actions were still as intense as before, inciting and making trouble everywhere. The Swiss police believed that this young radical was detrimental to the so-called security of the republic, and ordered him to be deported. So Mussolini had to flee to Lausanne, where he wrote a letter to his friend Dr. Weiss (DAWyss), who was the representative of the Socialist Party in Geneva:</p>
<p>"I just got a message from a Geneva newspaper that you are preparing to petition the Swiss Confederation to withdraw the order to expel me from the country - this order was proposed by the chief of police. I have a very short autobiography, which may be narrated for your reference. I came to Switzerland at the age of nineteen, and at first worked as a proper worker in Lausanne. Later, I returned to Italy to visit my mother, and soon lived with my friend Danatini, who was a political prisoner, in Annemass, on the French border. In this place, we wanted to start an 'international socialist review', but it was not successful. On March 1, 1904, I went to Geneva to register at the university; they will definitely tell you that I am an anarchist, which is completely untrue. In recent years, I have written many writings and speeches, and I have donated money to the Common People's Daily in New York, the Labor Struggle Daily in Lugano, and the Pioneer Daily in Milan. From these actions, to be honest, the police cannot find any anarchistic materials. In Switzerland and Italy, I am considered a socialist. Once, the proposal I put forward at the Zurich conference, although very revolutionary, cannot be determined to have an 'anarchistic color'. I wasted forty days in Geneva, spending most of my time in the university library. The police wanted to add a few strokes to their merit books, and simply dragged me into the net of crime, which is their usual trick; however, none of the reports are true. After I received this eviction order, I wanted to return the key to the room, clean up my belongings, and discuss with my lawyer; but they forced me to leave without explanation. The authorities told my lawyer that I had returned to Alimasi, which was a trick they deliberately used to deceive people, fearing that the lawyer would argue. In fact, I was forced to take a car to Josso, and then rush back to Italy. Only then did I realize the true face of the Republic, and simply threw aside the false signboard of the Republic guaranteeing freedom. This expulsion is not only a disgrace to the Republic, but even if the same event occurred in a monarchy, it might be an unconscious act! Now I am in Lausanne, hoping not to be oppressed by them again. I think that police chief wants to justify himself, I am afraid it will not be easy!"</p>
<p>From this letter, we can know that the wandering and helpless life of Mussolini, this poor young man, in the past few years has made significant changes in his thoughts and actions. At this time, Mussolini was no longer a naughty wild child, nor a young, energetic, and patriotic soldier. He was a hard worker who sought happiness for the poor, and also a young man who was eager to learn, and also participated in the organization of socialists. Although he was inevitably expelled by the Swiss government, he did not lose heart because of this.</p>

<h3>Interview with Chinese Film Artists (18) (Continued from Last Month's 28th)</h3>
<p>— Shaji</p>
<p>(8) Zhang Shichuan, Director of "Remnant Spring" (Part 1)</p>
<p>Regarding this gentleman, I think many people know that he is a giant in the Chinese film industry. Why? We only need to know him in his business; he is the controller of the Star Film Company, but at the same time he is also an artist. An entrepreneur and an artist, the combination of the two, his greatness is conceivable.</p>
<p>Because of his greatness, he must be a capable person, and because he is a capable person, he must work hard. Therefore, it is only now that I can get an opportunity to interview him in his busy schedule.</p>
<p>I really feel ashamed that for such a small matter, I actually bothered him to abandon all his official duties and run from the second floor to the director's department to meet me.</p>
<p>If we believe in the techniques of the Jianghu physiognomists, then looking at his face and figure, we can decide that he is a great nobleman. Look, his fat face, his short and thick body, is simply a complete big flower face. That whole body of meat is really well cultivated, and every bit shows his good fortune. He is already very developed now, and will continue to develop in the future. Although he does not have to be a first-rank official, he has at least developed the aura of being carried by eight people. This kind of aura is very amazing.</p>
<p>After a lot of nonsense, it is now time to record his conversation.</p>
<p>"Mr. Zhang went to Nanjing to film the National Games. What good opinions do you have about the National Games?" This is what I asked. I only heard him say:</p>
<p>"The results of this year's National Games are very good, and there are many athletes. Many events broke the national records. However, it is much worse than the Far Eastern Games and even worse than Japan. However, because some athletes have difficulties in life, they cannot solve the problem of eating and cannot practice sufficiently. However, there are many promising athletes among them. If they can continue to work hard with a stable life, they will definitely have good results in a short time. Therefore, I hope that the government authorities should be able to allocate a sum of money to stabilize their lives and allow these athletes to continue to practice. Now it is said that Liu Changchun is paid 100 yuan a month, and many others have nothing. I think it is better to arrange those good athletes into various government departments. Suppose there are 100 people, it only costs 100,000 yuan, which is a very small number for the government, but next year's Far Eastern Games and the 24th National Games will be very promising. ..."(To be continued)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "Too Much Harmony"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Too Much Harmony</p>
<p>—Paramount Production, Premiered at Da Guangming—</p>
<p>I watched the British "The Chance of Night Time" the day before yesterday, and then I watched "Too Much Harmony" yesterday. Because the stories of the two are quite similar, it is not impossible to mention them at the same time. For example, the former "The Chance of Night Time" tells the story of a lawyer who changes a wife one night, and the latter "Too Much Harmony" also writes about a young couple who give up their original lovers because of their emotional compatibility and finally reconcile. The two have the same theme; if you find a better object than your original lover before marriage, you should get the one you love.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that this kind of leisurely work does not express reality in a positive way. However, comparatively speaking, "The Chance of Night Time" is much more substantial in terms of the implicit aspect of the story and its horizontal development. Generally speaking, British films are different from the frivolousness of American films, and another example can be found here.</p>
<p>Isn't it? In this film, we can only see some so-called gorgeous appearances. Due to the appearance of the so-called All Star Cast, we certainly cannot ignore its business methods of using this as a selling point. On the other hand, the producer's caution in the production of this film can also be glimpsed at the same time. However, this all-star team is not as successful as the all-star team of "Grand Hotel." This does not mean that all the stars here are second-rate stars, but that at least in terms of content, it is not as tasty as "Grand Hotel."</p>
<p>Therefore, merely exaggerating the form cannot increase the value of the work, not to mention that the performance is not perfect. Here we can explain more specifically; the screenwriter wants to make Losue and Eddie divorce, and uses all means. The old lady of the song and dance troupe destroys it from the middle. It further explains that she wants to engage in destruction, not out of reluctance, but by adopting a method of revenge. This point is very commendable in writing skills. However, the author made a clumsy attempt to teach a person to impersonate the son of the match king, and Losue actually believed it, which is too childish. As for writing the vain Losue, because she knew the son of a rich man, she resolutely terminated her engagement with the vocalist, which is quite realistic.</p>
<p>In addition, the author unfolds the love scenes of the male and female protagonists in the play, subconsciously indicating that this is just a theatrical love. However, this is always an unexpected gain for the author.</p>
<p>The above is a review of the script, and in terms of performance, we have the following opinions.</p>
<p>The director has used the most modern dance forms as much as possible, fully demonstrating the American film's madness for form. Among those dance scenes, the most brilliant one is naturally the last one that uses "wind." However, this is just saying that he is more crazy about selling the temptation of flesh. If American films, in addition to these self-abandoning scenes, what else can show his characteristics?</p>
<p>Because the director's control over the actors is not very appropriate, and at the same time, he must make every star have a role to play, so we have not seen any actor with a unique performance here. Even for the male and female protagonists, in addition to the male protagonist Bing Crocby having a sonorous voice and the female protagonist being able to be so quiet, there is almost no better performance. However, for the two of them, it is slightly inferior to the "College Student's Humor" that was shown at the same theater before.</p>
<p>As for the scenery, we saw several very valuable stage devices. For example, the night scene at the bridge, the store layout, and the falling flowers blowing in the wind add a lot of color to this film.</p>
<h3>"Blood Road"</h3>
<p>— By Manqian</p>
<p>— Central Cinema —</p>
<p>In the past, apart from the so-called "Big Three" film companies, smaller-capital producers often took a different path due to a lack of equipment and talent. For example, since the transformation of the film industry last year—in other words, since the major companies began focusing on "realistic subjects"—many of the smaller producers continued to produce fantastical works to capture another segment of the audience.</p>
<p>However, the newly established White Rainbow Film Company was able to recognize its own mission and resolutely produce this work with anti-imperialist significance. Although it was not very successful, we should admire this perseverance.</p>
<p>"Blood Road" tells the story of an unemployed worker who seeks help from his father-in-law, a treacherous merchant, due to the burden of his family, but is rejected. As a result, he is forced to take the risk of becoming a thief. This illustrates the increase in unemployment, the ruthlessness of treacherous merchants, and the ever-expanding dark side of society. Later, a love story is inserted: the fiancée surprisingly sympathizes with him and leaves her family. After he is released from prison, she lives with him. Although the insertion of the love story does not make the whole play seem loose, the woman's change is a bit inexplicable. In the end, the worker joins the Volunteer Army. The play ends in a rather tragic scene.</p>
<p>The director often uses scenes with very dim lighting. Two shots are particularly worth mentioning: one is a "tracking shot" of dozens of workers carrying iron plates, and the other is a "medium shot" of Wang Chunyuan and a dozen other workers gathered together. It has a very New Russian flavor. The flickering of the light is undoubtedly due to the poor equipment. Among the actors, Qin Haha is the most moving. He exceptionally plays an impoverished old man, and his movements and facial expressions are very capable of touching the audience's heartstrings. Wang Chunyuan's movements are suitable for the identity of a worker, but his facial expressions are insufficient. As for the female lead, Qian Siying, she is a complete failure; neither her crying nor her smiling makes people feel any sincerity. The treacherous fat worker with one big eye and one small eye, although he does not have many scenes, leaves a deep impression on the audience. Therefore, the success or failure of an actor does not depend on whether they are a "main character" or a "minor character," but on whether they can fulfill their responsibilities in the role they play.</p>
<p>In short, "Blood Road" is still a very immature work, in terms of script, director, actors, photography, and set design. However, to encourage many of the emerging small producers, the reporter has lowered the standard and written this article.</p>
<h3>"The Technique of Love"</h3>
<p>— Review of Moore</p>
<p>Marry Me</p>
<p>— Grand Theatre —</p>
<p>American films occupy a "dominant" position in the Chinese market. This is true not only commercially but also in terms of audience interest. Therefore, many people find the more restrained British films uninteresting. In reality, the British are more conservative, so they do not "exaggerate" (or develop to the extreme) in various aspects of filmmaking.</p>
<p>Not developing to the extreme does not necessarily mean in terms of technique. Even with regard to the social function of film, they do not develop it, (naturally, subjectively, it is still beneficial to themselves).</p>
<p>"The Technique of Love" is a typical British film. Of course, "The Technique of Love" has many operatic elements. However, every British sound film has some operatic elements. This is the first point.</p>
<p>Secondly, British films often have a bit of humor added, and "The Technique of Love" is itself a comedy. Therefore, it does not necessarily rely on the actors' performances to make people laugh; the story itself is interesting.</p>
<p>However, "The Technique of Love" is revealing. It says that the young Robert does not love his colleague Anhen, but loves the banker's daughter Qina because he has long wanted to "obtain a wealthy daughter to get rich." Even later, when he "resolutely marries Anhen," it is only because "Anhen went to Robert's apartment to perform the duties of a housewife, and for a time, the trivial matters in the apartment were in good order," and it was only at the suggestion of Robert's two younger brothers.</p>
<p>In today's society, love is originally gilded, but some people insist on embellishing it, saying that "love is unconditional and supreme." Now, because the truth is too obvious, it can no longer be embellished. Therefore, it is also reflected in "The Technique of Love." He is openly admitting it.</p>
<p>In the past, I have seen many British films whose shots change very little. Often, there is a frontal medium shot, a close-up, and a long shot. Other close-ups, etc., are rarely used. The angles are also almost the same: a frontal view, a side view, and then a frontal view, rarely even using overhead or oblique views. This kind of shot and angle are suitable for filming musicals because musicals are inherently neat. As for ordinary films, the first thing to do is to be realistic. Therefore, the shots must follow the actors' free performances and change accordingly. Although the shots in "The Technique of Love" do not change as much or as strangely as in American films (naturally, unnecessary changes are not right), they are not as rigid as in many British films.</p>
<p>Moore was widely welcomed in "Happy Marriage" because of her excellent performance. Even in "Spoiled Darling", which she co-starred with Imogen Stubbs, she also gave many extraordinary performances. Here, whether she is playing a young girl who is infatuated with love, or a calm and patient young girl, she is able to convey the mood of the character to us through her expressions. I think it is very commendable!</p>
<h3>"Sacrifice" Filmed on Location at Zhenru</h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>The interior scenes of the Lianxing Film Company's "Sacrifice," including the male and female dormitories, have been completed, and the dock exterior scenes were also completed on the 30th of last month. Yesterday morning around 10 o'clock, the company went to Jinan University in Zhenru to shoot exterior scenes. A group of more than ten male and female actors arrived at the location and were suddenly surrounded by hundreds of students eager to watch the filming process. After Director Lu Shi and the director of student affairs of the school requested, the encirclement was lifted, and they began filming the entrance to the female dormitory and the students going to and from class. It is said that "Sacrifice" is set against the background of promoting the patriotic enthusiasm of overseas Chinese students and young people across the country, and also focuses on the tense situation of Jinan University students participating in the anti-Japanese war during the "January 28th Incident." Therefore, the school believes that this film is of great significance for promoting education, so it has specifically allowed it to be filmed as a background and is doing its best to assist in the completion of the film.

<h3>Novel and Film Feast No More Dinner at Eight (5)</h3>
<p>— Ma Teng</p>
<p>Oliver Jordan, because Carlotta Vance was going to sell her stock, thought of Packard. Packard used to be just a miner, but now he has money and mixes with financiers and presidents. Today, he invited him to his office to ask if he would be willing to help the Jordan Company in this time of economic panic if the need arose. Packard appeared to be nonchalant. Perhaps he was willing, but his words were very evasive. He wanted to see the list of shareholders first. What if Carlotta's stock was sold to him? ... What if he really bought enough of Jordan Company's stock? ... Fostick, the old manager of the Jordan Company, who had been working since his father's time, did not trust that Packard at all. He said! "I can't trust Packard any more than I can trust pulling the cow's tail to knock the cow down." Fostick's words were insightful, but Oliver hoped that his insight was wrong ... In this difficult time, he had to believe someone ... he had to ask for someone's help ... Where could he find this person? And there was tonight's banquet. That boring Fincliffe and his shrewish wife ... But Carlotta would definitely come, she was still so witty and charming ... Perhaps he could talk to her and stop her from selling the stock ... Packard would also definitely come. With diplomatic means, he might be able to establish a personal friendship ... Perhaps Packard could help him by bailing him out. ...</p>
<p>In Packard's house, in Kitty's dressing room, Kitty looked at her new makeup in the mirror, her heart full of happiness. Packard ran in and said beside her, "Okay. Jordan's stock has been bought, bought under someone else's name." He stretched his sleeves and said, "I'd pay a thousand dollars to see Jordan walk into the meeting room on Monday when the shareholders meet, and see Baldridge and Weston each holding a large roll of stock. What kind of expression would he have on his face!" After he finished speaking, he put his hands in his pockets and confidently returned to his own dressing room.</p>
<p>Kitty sat quietly without saying a word, lost in thought. Packard wasn't the only one with ambition in the world. She also knew what methods to use to get what she needed. Like her husband, she was good at using means to seize what belonged to others and make it her own. When her husband came in again, she cunningly said, "I guess this is the last time Jordan invites us ... If he finds out that it was your trick, how can he not hate you?" Packard snorted and said, "Tch, how would he know? It's all arranged. Hah, who do you think I am!" He paced around her room again, full of confidence. Kitty glared at him and said, "You're so clever, you'll end up in jail one day!" Packard nonchalantly said, "It's too early to put me in jail. They've been watching me since I was in Montana. But I got Cooper Hill, and I got Ema. Then I came to New York, and they all belonged to me. Heh, whose wife has a man with such big balls?" He looked at the diamond bracelet on his wife's soft jade arm. (To be continued)</p>
