<p>水災恐怖中之水利問題梓</p>
<p>最近兩週間。長江水勢。以時値夏汛。突然高漲。據日來沿江各地電訊。水位則繼長增高。形勢則日益險惡。人心惶惶。幾若兩年前之大水災。即將　見於目前者。在此恐怖時期中。吾輩新聞記者。既高聲疾呼以促政府之迅集全力以防災。政府當局。亦急召防汛會議。籌商防災之計劃。語云。有備無患。今後倘能雨量不加。水勢漸緩。固為沿江居民之大幸。否則集各水利專家之心力。以各省當局之負責防救。災害即難免。犧牲或可稍減乎。雖然。目前之恐怖未已。將來之禍患可慮。吾人今日。對於揚子江水利之問題。殊不可不一加研討也。水利專家。鑑於揚子江水位。自有紀載以來。須約經十年。發現一高紀錄。希望本年或可不致成災。然在事實上。今日去二十年大水之時。僅僅兩年。漢口等地水位。有已較當臄同時期為高者。經濟委員會工務課長朱墉君為之說曰。「古者與水爭地。懸為属禁。民國二十年。國府亦有廢田還湖之議乃一般人不以利害相權。於水災委員會所築幹堤之外。又增小堤洞庭鄱陽之間。圩堤如綱。化滄海為桑田。水無相當之去路。而欲其不肇禍。難矣。」然則此次水勢高漲之最近原因。其在於濱湖居民。佔湖為田。縮小江水之去路乎。揚子江自宜昌至漢口一段。本為水患最多之地。蓋江流下荊門。出虎牙。放於平原。其力至偉。昔時已因河道之屈曲。長堤之障阻。妨其宣洩。而使「江之患在楚。」二十年巨大犧牲之後。屈曲之河道依然。密佈之沙洲依然。枝流未加暢。湖泊吐納之量未增多。反大長佔湖成田之風。以造成此之大患。禍實自召。殊未可以天災目之也。</p>
<p>世界最擅水浰之國為荷蘭。荷人與天然力相門爭。能征服海水。障阻狂瀾。使不為害。今我揚子江之水患。為患之原因。乃由近江之人自造之。居民既徒知個人之小利。圩澤地以造私產。而未晤水患之成。若干之他人財產。他人生命。將盡為所犧牲。政府亦只能臨時張皇。堵水搶險。抱急來之佛。而不能於根本水利設施。有所注意。二十年巨大水災之後。更經今次之恐怖。其能有所警悟乎。</p>

<p>第二盤開始頗見緊張之勢、林取首局後、連失兩局、但寳林旦又顯軟弱之病、精神淹没不振、殊少佳作、林獲一而再、頗不費力、結果又成六比三林勝、裁判孫麟力、</p>

<p>第二盤但茄維亞頗有一鼓作氣、再衰而竭之勢、一盤方畢、竟至於飲水更衣、已有倦態、邱飛海鎭靜如故、不慌不忙、每以遠近之擊法、使茄維亞疲於奔命、加以茄時有大意失守之弊、是以是盤結果、邱以六比二報復、未見費力、第三盤茄維亞再換襯衫、稍事休息後、作第三盤之逐鹿、邱先以二比一佔先、下局茄維亞連勝三記、以為可穩得各二平手、不料以後一失再失、反又失敗、邱遂以三比一勝、氣熖益盛茄維亞力謀振作、頗有力不從心之慨、球取守勢、頗少進攻、實為下策、是盤結果、邱又以六比二勝裁判周家騏、</p>

<h3 id="c96">霉雨期内無線電收音機之保護法 <a href="#c96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— 何達之</p>
<p>（一）霉雨期內收音機容易損</p>
<p>壞之原因</p>
<p>一切電氣器具，最忌潮濕。而收音機之感覺又非常靈敏，故潮濕對於收音機之影響甚鉅，是以霉雨期內收音機最易損壞。蓋收音機受潮時，因水爲導體，故電流能經濕氣而逃逸（此種現象即所謂漏電。）或導線因受潮腐蝕而斷線，遂致百病叢生矣。</p>
<p>（二）收音機本身之故障</p>
<p>當收音機正在工作時，吾人以手接觸線圈，則收音機之感度立即低落，如不將再生力充分增强，則將完全寂然無聲。若以手接觸栅漏或栅極電容器或高週率放大管之栅極導線，亦得同樣之結果。即線圈或栅極導線受潮時，亦同樣使感度低落，再生力微弱，選擇性惡劣也。</p>
<p>其次低週率變壓器受潮後，音量減低，且其捲線易斷。而此種故障爲收音機損壞之次多數原因。（收音機損壞原因以眞空管發生故障爲最多數）又電源變壓器受潮後，各部絕緣變劣，遂使音量減低，且發生極大之交流聲（Ｈｕｍ）。</p>
<p>故放置收音機之地位。須選擇空氣流通而乾燥且塵埃稀少之處，（粘附塵埃後則塵埃容易吸收潮濕）在霉雨期内當天氣晴朗之日，須將收音機移至窗前通風，並拭清塵埃。</p>
<p>又選購收音機時，須擇匣身全閉及零件接線密藏匣內者，則塵埃及潮濕自少侵入爲害之機會。</p>
<p>（三）擴聲器之故障</p>
<p>此種故障正與低週率變壓器相同，內部捲線易斷。此外則爲導線之不良，致流於擴聲器線圈之電流洩漏，遂使音量減低。發生此種故障時，可將導線更換新者。</p>
<p>第一圖　絕緣不良之導線</p>
<p>符號　　表示</p>
<p>收音机之電流</p>
<p>洩漏之電流</p>
<p>（四）天線之故障絕緣子及支柱等潮濕時，則電波多洩漏於地（如第二圖），遂致感度變鈍，再生力微弱，選擇性惡劣，惟絕緣子不能將其一一揩拭乾浄，故以使用兩個絕緣子連結爲佳。</p>
<p>第二圖</p>
<p>虛線所示</p>
<p>爲因絕緣</p>
<p>體不良而</p>
<p>漏洩電流</p>
<p>屋內引入線大都爲包皮線，不宜釘於容易受潮之牆壁上，以釘於木柱或木樑上爲佳。</p>
<p>（五）電池電池各極突出之表面或其側面受潮時，電流洩漏，電池之消耗增大。（如第三圖）若置於收音機匣內之電池發生第三圖電池</p>
<p>此種現象而</p>
<p>與其他回路</p>
<p>接觸時，甚</p>
<p>至可使收音</p>
<p>機寂然無聲</p>
<p>。</p>
<p>是以電池亦與收音機同，應置於乾燥而空氣流通之處，並須時常用布片拭去塵埃爲要。如甲乙電用蓄電池者。則尤宜注意之。</p>
<p>（六）雷鳴時之注意</p>
<p>霉雨期內常有雷鳴，使收音機雜聲增大，甚至擾亂不能收聽。此時當然須將天線開關放下，使與地線相接。交流收音機且須取下電源之撲落。</p>
<p>目前正當霉雨時期，凡置有收音機者，均宜特加保護，以免意外之損失也。（完）（自無線電話」節譯）</p>
<h3 id="c97">夏季收音機使用之常識 <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— 程權</p>
<p>（一）收音機全部應放置乾爽之處。以防霉氣入內。損壞收音機。（二）收音機內置生石灰數包以吸收濕氣。（三）天線回路內加裝避雷設置。或雷雨時將天地線連接以免意外。（四）交流收音機如使用過久。機身發熱。則須休息數分鐘再開。或於初級電源進綫內。直連一電燈泡。（瓦特數與收音機等。以燈泡暗紅爲度）。則雖久用。不致發熱。</p>
<p>（五）直流收音機之甲乙丙電池不用時。須將引綫由機內拆出。以免木箱漏電。（六）長短波收音機之用挿入式線圈者。其線圈須置於最乾燥之處。否則極易失效。（七）收音距離不遠。音量音質轉劣。此乃受氣候之影響。勿貿然拆修。</p>
<h3 id="c98">乾電池的復活法 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— 經</p>
<p>電的用途和世界的進步是永遠成爲正比例，世界愈是進步，電的用途愈顯廣闊，所以近數年來電的用途，一天大似一天，乾電池就是其中的一個例子，好像手電筒，小無線電收音機，以及其他需電少的機器都是用牠。無線電收音機盛行以來，乾電池的銷路，就隨着興盛了。雖然可以把交流電來代替乾電，但從手續上經濟上着想，總覺有些麻煩，何况現今的一二燈機都是採用乾電池呢？但是有一件事，是很可惜的，就是乾電池的力量有限，倘使一朝用完以後，就没有用了，祇可别買新的，這不是很不經濟嗎？現在有一個法子，可使得已經用完的乾電池，重復有電。現在我把這個法子寫在下面，介紹給讀者，希望多多採用，極力節省金錢。拿鹽碯（Ammoniachloride)溶在一碗（不一定是碗，祇須是玻璃或陶土做的東西均可）溫水中使牠成功飽和溶液，（就是拿鹽碯倒在水中，用棒攪扞，等牠完全溶在水中，或完全不見後，再加鹽碯，再攪，直到牠不能再溶在水中爲止。）再拿用完而壳子未成壞的乾電池，在牠的壳子上，開幾個小孔，然後拿牠放在這溶液中。這樣放幾個鐘頭後，再拿出來，電就有了。這個法子，鄙人也試過幾次，雖然復活的乾電池，用起來没有新的長久，（至少有十小時之電力）但是比較再買一管新的，却便宜得多哩。末了，我要聲明，就是放在溶液中的時候，不可使得中間的炭精條，也碰到這溶液，若然碰到之後，就不發生效力了。附註：這樣的復活，有三次的可能，不過電力則一次减少一次。</p>

<h3 id="c99">兩種繞製短波線圈的方法 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— 襄</p>
<p>短波收音機的挿入線圈，因爲時常須調換，所以易鬆脱，要免除這種弊病，袛須在繞製時，先將導線置在火爐旁烘熱，導線受熱後，即自行膨脹，於是趁其熱時，迅速繞在膠管上，俟冷却後，導線收縮，此線圈緊纏膠管，十分牢固，可歷久不鬆。導線蔴線</p>
<p>有時線圈須用間隔燒法（SpacingWinding），即每圈間須隔一相等距離，此種線圈頗難繞製，最簡易的方法，可另以一蔴線與導線並繞，蔴線的粗細，視所需間隔的距離而定，繞製完畢後，將蔴線除去，導線就很整齊。（如圖）</p>

<p>— 李元慶</p>
<p>在裝西藥用的玻璃管的外部，糊上一層半圓形的錫箔，再在一段相當大小的圓木上，照樣糊上一層錫箔。使用時，把圓木挿入玻管內，再把玻管套在木塞上，便成一個小量的可變電容器。</p>

<p>— 黄鑑村</p>
<p>▲..........</p>
<p>（一概要）</p>
<p>自來發射機因振盪電流發生方法之不同，分有火花式，電弧式，發電機式，眞空管式四種，茲先將此等方式一一叙述於下，以比較其優劣。火花式者係由火花放電，在振盪電路中發生自由振盪，以此傳諸天線而發射於空間。此種方式在昔日頗爲無線電報界所盛用，然因其所發射之電波，係所謂減幅電波，含有廣範圍之種種波長，有碍其他通信，是以一九二七年在華盛頓所開之第三次國際無線電報會議，規定自一九三零年起禁止採用。至一九四零年此種方式必將絕跡，可以斷言。又在眞空管未發明以前，亦曾有人試用減幅率較少之瞬滅火花式以作無線電話之實騐，然因具有由火花所引起之雜音與聲音不明瞭之缺點，故迄未能施諸實用。電弧式者雖亦屬諸發射等幅電波之方式，然因電弧之發生，易生不安定之狀態，且因不能發射純粹等幅電波，較之其他等幅電波式雜音尤多，亦有碍於其他通信，故仍由國際無線電條約規定禁用，與火花式遭同一之運命，此方式因雜音多，明瞭度欠佳，且不適用於短波長，故未能轉用於無線電話。發電機式能發射純粹等幅電波，目下仍爲長波無綫電報界所盛用。既能發射純粹等幅電波，按理亦可能用於無線電話，然在構造上欲使其發生如目前廣播波是之短波頗非易事，且有調節不易之缺點，故此方式仍不能適用。眞空管式可謂現在無線電界之寵兒，不論無線電報或無線電話均甚適用。無線電話因眞空管之出現方有如今日之盛况.是乃盡人而知者。此方式之所以能獨占優勢者自爲其特點在∶即(一)能發射純粹之等幅電波,(二)波長與電力可任意使用.(二)明瞭度特優等等是也（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c102">災 <a href="#c102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— 百合</p>
<p>眞是糟糕，也不知究竟是中國命該遭災，還是「災」合中國特别親熱，累得「大慈善家」，一年到頭捧着捐簿，找人「隨願樂助」，「大遊藝家」，摩項放踵的「戲資充賑。」總之，中國的「災星正盛」，「災運亨通」，</p>
<p>是無可諱言的。</p>
<p>「飛機擲炸彈」，「圍城奪地盤」，造成了「災民」。甲派興，乙系倒，「刷新吏治，」造成了「災官」。國勢凌替，外交屈辱，造成了「災僑」。這些都是與「蛟洪暴發」，「蝗蝻過境」，以及「三年未見滴雨」，有些不同的。我無以名之，名之曰「人造災」。</p>
<p>據這幾天報上的消息看來，今年武漢的大水，是又不免於「洋洋乎大觀哉」的了。這自然是「天災」，「天災」是誰也怨不了誰的，惟有硬着頭皮領略「災味」。</p>
<p>其實，武漢就是大水為災，也不過二年一次，水退了，就恢復了，　不用大驚小怪。在陜西，甘肅，旱得不能種荘稼。「易子而食」，「野犬食人」，不希罕，十八歲的大姑娘，褲子都没有得穿，那才算是「災情奇重」呢。</p>
<p>這些「災」，果然是怕人，但是，究竟還是限於一地，充極其量，也不過像前年的「十六省被災」，現在雖除了東北四省算，也有好幾省没有「被災」咧。惟有普遍於全國的「智議譏荒」，那才有資格「領導羣災」而許為「災中翹楚」。</p>
<p>中國的災，何止「三災六難」。唐和尙西天取經，不遇九九八十一災難，而且還是勉强凑數的，我們中國的「天災」，「人造災」若計算一下，或不止此數。唐和尙遇了八十一災，就「功德圓滿，而成正果」，我們中國歴了這許多「災」，還是「苦海無邊，回頭無岸」。多災多難的中國，還是災星未退，災刦重重，所以有人說，救災最好的方法，惟有遍謂高僧，啟建金剛法會，或誦經禮佛，以冀「上邀天庥」，「消災降福」，至於「風調雨順」，「國泰民安」。</p>

<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>是某晚給我的感想∶電燈突然熄了，深夜的街，全陷于黑暗裏，我的寫字間，也分辨不出所有的物件。眼睛在這時候，幾與蠟人相同；一樣没有視覺的力量，正像陷在深黝的煤礦裏，那安全燈忽被吹熄了的樣子。你由隣家的門縫裏溜出一穗微黄的紅蠟燭光，雖然穗，却比衆光明和可愛。一件東西在需要的時候。就是平時不被注意而且以為無用的；却格外發生不尋常的功能了。於是我幽手幽脚的摸到了火柴，擦出亮光，在塵封的書架上，搜尋白蠟燭。接連耗費了五六根火柴，纔發現了一枝被野鼠嚼殘的白禮氏。僅僅這一枝燃着火，膠住在茶盤上，那桃形的火焰，便生出芒角，吐着光亮，輝照全室。覺得捩亮電燈在白晝的昏暗，遠不如燃燒蠟燭在黑夜的光明！燭的勝利，就在它嚼火的微小！</p>
<p>假如是殘冬的除夕，窗外正飛着雪，在山村裏；燒着一枝紅燭，靠窗看雪裏的梅花與椏枝漸漸加肥，因了燭光的輻射，那光景又是多麼美麗！而况肩旁立有一女詩人,同暈於淡宕的燭光中,默默地對視,繼着微笑,然而很靜;那又是什麼情景！</p>
<p>假如談過三國演義的話,也許會想到二十五回中的一節,說「關公自投曹操操欲亂其君臣之禮,使關公與二嫂共處一室,關公乃秉燭立於户外,自夜達旦,毫無倦色」。體會一下，便覺得眼前活畫出一個英武的將軍,按劍裂眦,對燭光怒視的那種凜然的態度！</p>
<p>當蠟燭光閃爍的瞬間，便聯想到了以上兩個不同的境界。但我又注意起那燭涙漸漸墮下，燭心漸漸短去，賸餘也漸</p>
<p>少了；我感覺到這樣燒下去是不久便會消滅盡了的，我看着自已的影，便泫然了。寫了一首舊詩：「相對簾波纈眼紋，却憐孤影伴黄昏，徘徊雲髻形先毀，追索光明心自焚！∶∶∶」眞的，那些櫻粟花腦袋的青年人們，只懂得花枝一樣的時髦小姐，只追求抽象的名字，光明做了一長篇宛轉的紅夢，結果僅把自已的軀體，跟着涙，在自已的謎一般的光暈裏，漸漸短，漸漸消滅，漸漸化為青烟。「替人垂涙到天明」？然而，黑夜之後，繼着終是天明！</p>

<h3 id="e1">River Water at Hankow Level with the Banks <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Local Authorities Actively Undertaking Flood Prevention Work</p>
<p>(Hankow) The Yangtze River water level on the 23rd, except for Hankow and Kiukiang, which rose five inches each, Shashi and Yuezhou were stable, Yichang and Changsha receded slightly, and there were no major rises or falls in downstream ports. People's hearts are slightly at ease. (23rd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hankow) The river water rose five inches on the 23rd, with the water mark at 46 feet 2 inches, only four inches away from the level of the banks. The construction of the embankment along the river has been 60-70% completed. The Japanese concession is being repaired day and night and can be completed in three days. The municipal government advocates Sino-foreign cooperation on flood prevention matters. On the 23rd, it sent letters to the Japanese and French consulates and Special District 3 to discuss and assist at any time and jointly plan the progress. From the 23rd, all foreign firms and companies on Zhongjie Street have built flood prevention fortresses at their entrances, and all drains have been sealed. (23rd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hankow) The river water continued to rise three inches on the evening of the 23rd, reaching 46 feet 5 inches. (23rd Special Telegram) (Hankow) On the 23rd, the river water was level with the banks in the areas of the Dragon King Temple, Dakou Lane, Bridge Entrance, and Zongguan in Hankow. The city's flood prevention was divided into nine sections. Sections 1 to 7 were established on the 23rd, and sections 8 and 9 were established on the 24th. The headquarters ordered all counties on the 23rd to earnestly prevent floods and allocated 50,000 yuan in flood prevention funds and 100,000 sacks for flood prevention purposes. (23rd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain water conservancy expert said that this year's Yangtze River water level increase is similar to that of the Xinhai year (1911). The reason is that there was excessive rainfall in April, May, and June this year, and the lakes in various places are becoming increasingly silted up, reducing their capacity, causing the Yangtze River to be unable to drain in time. If there are no strong winds and heavy rains in the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in the next ten or twenty days, and the weather is sunny, the water level can gradually recede day by day. If the heavens do not cooperate, the areas along the Yangtze River in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu will be at risk of flooding, and the degree of the disaster will be proportional to the amount of rainfall. According to the highest water level in July of the Xinhai year, which was 47 feet, there was not much rainfall after July of that year, so there was no flooding. (23rd Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Yangtze River Flood Prevention Conference held a review meeting on the morning of the 23rd and a second general meeting at 2:00 pm. More than 30 people, including Zhou Xiangxian, attended. The meeting discussed the various proposals submitted by the morning review meeting and passed them after discussion. The content is roughly as follows: (1) Regarding the method of flood prevention by district and section, it was decided to divide the provinces along the Yangtze River into six major districts, with one chief engineer in each district responsible for the entire flood prevention. The division of districts is as follows: (1) Jiangsu District is divided into five sections, (2) Beijing District is divided into two sections, (3) Anhui District is divided into fifteen sections, (4) Jiangxi District is divided into eight sections, four sections along the Yangtze River and four sections along Poyang Lake, (5) Hubei District is divided into eight sections, five sections along the Yangtze River and three sections along the Han River, (6) Hunan District is divided into eleven sections, two sections along the Yangtze River and nine sections along the lake. (2) The flood prevention policy proposed by the Yangtze River Conservancy Commission was slightly revised and passed in its entirety. (3) The organizational charter of the Yangtze River Flood Prevention Conference was adopted. The conference headquarters will be established in Kiukiang starting on the 24th and will last until the autumn floods. It will be organized by eight agencies, including the Yangtze River Conservancy Commission, the National Economic Commission, the Construction Departments of Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan, and the Beijing Municipal Government, with the Yangtze River Conservancy Commission as the chairman. (4) All technical personnel from various provinces should be transferred to flood prevention. Those that are insufficient will be supplemented by the National Economic Commission and the Yangtze River Conservancy Commission. (5) Report to the National Government and the Military Commission immediately to announce the establishment and request assistance. (6) The flood prevention funds, how much each province will be responsible for and how much the central government will be responsible for, will be统筹 by the Flood Prevention Conference. (7) It is stipulated that the magistrates of all counties along the river are members of the Flood Prevention Committee and are responsible for recruiting workers and raising materials. The detailed plan will be announced after整理. The conference ended on the 23rd. Stooke, due to the tight situation of the Han River, decided to fly to Hankou on the 24th. The directors of the construction departments of various provinces will leave Beijing after attending the founding ceremony of the Beijing-Wuhu Highway. Zhou Xiangxian and Song Xishang will go to Kiukiang to preside over the Flood Prevention Conference. The staff of the Flood Prevention Conference will be transferred from the Yangtze River Conservancy Commission. (23rd Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Mr. Stooke, the American expert and chief engineer of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau of the National Economic Commission, flew from Hankou to Beijing on the 22nd to attend the Flood Prevention Conference. According to him, the four counties of E Wu Jia Pu Xian have suffered countless losses to public and private land over the years due to the backflow of the river water. This year, the National Economic Commission decided to build the Jinshui Gate Dam to prevent waterlogging in summer and drain accumulated water in winter. The estimated cost is more than 300,000 yuan. After the completion of the project, one million mu of good land will be opened up. The project was originally planned to be implemented immediately. Chairman Jiang believed that the completion of the dam would have a great impact on the rural economy, so he ordered it to be built quickly. Therefore, a temporary deep river dam was first built in May, and the closure was completed on May 22. It was still being completed, but due to the sudden rise in water level, the workers were working day and night to increase the height and thickness. Unexpectedly, the water was deep and the dam was high, and the flow was fierce and rapid, which eventually washed away the dam in the heavy rain on the 20th of this month, causing the river water to backflow as before. It was also reported that Xue Zhaoshu, the engineer in charge of the Jinshui Dam, had been dismissed by the Engineering Office of the National Economic Commission for investigation.

<p>After Reaching an Agreement with His Subordinates, Song Visits He and Huang to Request Instructions on How to Proceed</p>
<p>(Peiping) Song Zheyuan's representatives, Zhang Jiyong, Lei Jishang, and others, returned to Peiping from Zhangheng this morning. After getting off the train, they went to Song's residence to report on their meeting with Feng. Song then invited Qin Dechun and the division commanders under his command, Feng Zhian and others, to his residence for discussions, which continued until noon. It is reported that the Chahar issue is still under discussion and is not optimistic. Feng's attitude is as follows: (1) He earnestly hopes that Song will quickly lead his troops back to his post. His personal advance or retreat is not a problem. (2) "Resisting foreign aggression, not opposing internal forces." He has recently ordered Ji Hongchang, Fang Zhenwu, Deng Jiao, and other troops to concentrate in the Kangbao area and recover Dolon within ten days to show his determination to resist Japan. (3) He will make concrete arrangements for the troops of Sun, Fang, Deng, and others who have made meritorious contributions in resisting Japan, hoping to give them appropriate titles or positions. (4) He has not yet considered the title of Overseer of Reclamation and Development for himself. Therefore, he telegraphed to cancel the title of Allied Army and must wait until Song returns to Chahar before discussing it further. In addition to telegraphing Song, Feng also wrote a personal letter and handed it to Zhang Jiyong and others to bring back to Song. After Song and others consulted, they went to He Yingqin and Huang Fu to request instructions on how to proceed. Yesterday, Ji Hongchang, under Feng's orders, went from Zhangheng to Zhangbei County to inspect the troops stationed there and to negotiate the reorganization of Liu Guitang's troops and the reorganization of Mongolian bandit Wu Changshou and others. (23rd) (Peiping) The two telegrams issued by Fang Zhenwu and Ji Hongchang the day before yesterday will not have a significant impact on the overall situation. Fang's telegram is to implement his original anti-Japanese stance, and Ji's telegram is to lead his troops north to recover lost territory as a show of resistance to foreign aggression. Ji has now led cavalry and the righteous army under Deng Wen and Li Haiqing to Zhangbei for assembly last night, and Fang's troops are also heading north, preparing to recover Dolon within ten days. It is indeed possible that Liu Guitang's troops will revolt. His deputy commander, Shang Wu, is now in Zhangheng. Feng has ordered Liu's troops to gather in Guyuan and hold their position for a counterattack. The market in Zhangheng is currently as quiet as usual. (23rd Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(Peiping) Song Zheyuan suspended his inspection of Guanyintang today because Zhang Jiyong and others returned to Peiping. After Zhang returned to Peiping this morning to meet with Song, Song immediately convened the division commanders under his command to discuss how to resolve the Chahar situation. After 4 pm, Song visited He and Huang to exchange views on the Chahar situation. Feng's letter to Song was mainly hoping that Song would return to Chahar as soon as possible, with very simple and firm words. Feng also instructed Zhang Jiyong and others to return to Peiping quickly to convey his intentions. Feng did not want to express his views on Pang. If Pang's troops follow Song's troops back to Chahar, there may be no problems. If Pang's troops go first, there may be other complications. Because the army and division commanders under Feng's command have been nervous recently and cannot put down the banner of resistance to Japan, they must negotiate with Song again to convey their opinions to the government. He Yingqin invited various generals to talk tonight to discuss the defense area issues of various armies. (23rd Special Telegram)</p>

According to him, he personally went to Shacheng under Sun's orders to discuss the matter of going to Qinghai to reclaim wasteland. Our army has decided to set off in two routes: one route will go from Shacheng to Qinghai via the Ping绥 Road to Baotou, Wuyuan, Ningxia, and then Gansu to Xining, without stopping in the middle; the other route will go from Jincheng through Tongguan and then Gansu. After the departure order is issued, it is planned to set up an office in Tongguan. When they arrive in Qinghai, they will divide the area for reclamation. They will also build two roads in Qinghai, one from Qinghai through Gansu to Suiyuan, and one from Qinghai through Gansu to Shaanxi.

<p>(London) Chinese representatives Yan Huiqing, Gu Weijun, and Guo Taiqi telegraphed the Guangdong Provincial Government from London today, urging Chinese leaders to cooperate with each other. The telegram refers to the Guangdong government's telegram to the League of Nations on June 12 and the representatives' telegram, the main points of which are as follows: (1) Fierce battles between Chinese troops in the north, with tens of thousands of Chinese soldiers killed and wounded in the recent fighting east of Peiping. (2) The Sino-Japanese armistice is purely military in nature, similar to the Shanghai armistice last year. (3) With regard to sanctions under Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant and the severance of diplomatic relations with Japan, the Chinese people welcome them in principle, but the timing of their application must be carefully selected. (4) The telegram issued by the Guangdong government gives Japan the opportunity to exaggerate China's division. Any lack of cooperation among Chinese leaders will weaken China and the position of its representatives abroad. (23rd Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>The Chief of the Niulanshan Public Security Bureau is Replaced by an Official from Huairou County</p>
<p>(Peiping) There is still no way to deal with the pseudo-army in Eastern Rehe. The Japanese Kwantung Army is still taking a delaying attitude, and has not given any concrete answers to the various issues we have raised. The various traitors have recently declared independence in Eastern Rehe, attempting to develop a special force. We have now lodged a protest with the Japanese side, requesting them to abide by the armistice agreement, quickly withdraw their troops, and allow the counties in the war zone to be taken over and reorganized as soon as possible. Although the Japanese side has stated that it will not provide assistance to the pseudo-army, the pseudo-army is rampant everywhere and acts recklessly. Its background is self-evident. Therefore, the authorities are quite anxious about this. (23rd Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(Peiping) People from Luanping talked about the fact that during the previous fierce battle at Gubeikou, the Japanese army suffered more than 2,000 casualties. There are now many bodies in the war zone, and the stench is unbearable when passing by. The Japanese army originally stationed in Gubeikou, about one regiment, has withdrawn in groups, but has been replaced by the Suzuki Brigade, which has also established a garrison command in Hexi. Warehouses and radio stations are located in Hedong. The Japanese army in Gubeikou lives in civilian houses, and every family has them. They take naked baths every day and occasionally tease women, causing young women to flee to the surrounding villages. The Japanese authorities have brought dozens of Japanese and Korean prostitutes to open two brothels. Japanese soldiers and traitors often plunder civilian property, and the people are afraid of them like tigers. The Japanese army has transported all the food stored by the people out of the pass. "Manchukuo" customs have been established in Gubeikou, and the people's lives there have fallen into despair. (23rd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Peiping) People from Zunhua talked about the fact that there are more than a thousand local pseudo-armies, all of whom are bandits and gangsters. The leader, Li Qingshan, recently claimed to be the commander-in-chief of the East Asian Allied Army with the support of the Japanese army, extorting and raping without doing anything. Opium, heroin, and other drugs are sold openly on the streets. There are only a few dozen Japanese soldiers, who seem to be preparing to withdraw recently. Japanese rogues are selling the supplies they looted from our army. (23rd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan has not received an official report on the Tangshan pseudo-army's expanded propaganda conference, so it cannot be discussed. However, according to reports from North China for several days, there are indeed Japanese people manipulating behind the pseudo-army. The Japanese are using Feng's ten armies formed in Zhangjiakou, which have not been resolved. Fang Zhenwu is also acting freely. The arrangement of miscellaneous troops in Chahar will not be completed in a short period of time. Therefore, they have also come up with a Hao Peng pseudo-army, making it impossible for us to take over Eastern Rehe. It is heard that the Japanese side will only agree to completely hand over the jurisdictions of Eastern Rehe after the Zhangjiakou incident is completely resolved. If the Zhangjiakou incident is not resolved, they will use Li Jichun's pseudo-army to disrupt us and drag it on. Therefore, there are still many thorns in the North China issue.

<p>Water Conservancy Issues Amidst Flood Terror by Zi</p>
<p>In the past two weeks, the Yangtze River's water level has suddenly risen due to the summer flood season. According to recent dispatches from various locations along the river, the water level continues to rise, and the situation is becoming increasingly dangerous. People are panicked, as if the great flood of two years ago is about to reappear. During this period of terror, we journalists are loudly calling on the government to quickly mobilize all its forces to prevent disasters. The government authorities have also urgently convened flood control meetings to plan for disaster prevention. As the saying goes, "Preparedness averts peril." If rainfall does not increase in the future and the water level gradually recedes, it would be a great blessing for the residents along the river. Otherwise, even with the combined efforts of various water conservancy experts and the responsible rescue efforts of the provincial authorities, disasters will be difficult to avoid, and sacrifices may only be slightly reduced. However, the current terror has not yet ended, and future disasters are still worrisome. Today, we must carefully study the issue of Yangtze River water conservancy. Water conservancy experts, based on the historical records of the Yangtze River water level, believe that a high record is reached approximately every ten years and hope that this year will not result in a disaster. However, in fact, only two years have passed since the great flood of the 20th year of the Republic of China, and the water level in places like Hankou is already higher than it was during the same period back then. Zhu Yongjun, the head of the Public Works Section of the Economic Commission, said, "In ancient times, competing with water for land was strictly prohibited. In the 20th year of the Republic of China, the National Government also proposed returning farmland to lakes. However, people do not weigh the advantages and disadvantages and build small dikes outside the main dikes built by the Flood Disaster Committee. Dikes are like nets between Dongting and Poyang, turning the sea into mulberry fields. Without adequate outlets for the water, it is difficult to prevent disasters." Therefore, the most recent cause of the high water level is the residents living near the lakes occupying the lakes for farmland, reducing the outlet for the river water. The section of the Yangtze River from Yichang to Hankou has always been the area most prone to flooding. The river flows down from Jingmen, out of Huya, and onto the plain with great force. In the past, the meandering river channels and the obstruction of long dikes hindered its discharge, causing "the troubles of the Yangtze to lie in Chu." After the huge sacrifices of the 20th year, the meandering river channels remain, the densely distributed sandbars remain, the tributaries have not been smoothed, and the capacity of the lakes to absorb and release water has not increased. Instead, the trend of occupying lakes for farmland has greatly increased, causing this great disaster. The disaster is self-inflicted and cannot be attributed to natural causes.</p>
<p>The world's most skilled country in water management is the Netherlands. The Dutch compete with natural forces, conquering the sea and blocking raging waves to prevent them from causing harm. Today, the cause of the Yangtze River's flooding is self-inflicted by the people living near the river. Residents only know their own small interests, enclosing wasteland to create private property, without considering the resulting flood disaster. The property and lives of others will be sacrificed. The government can only panic temporarily, blocking water and rushing to rescue, clinging to the Buddha in a crisis, without paying attention to fundamental water conservancy facilities. After the huge flood disaster of the 20th year, and now with this current terror, can they learn a lesson?</p>
<h3 id="e27">The Situation at the World Economic Conference is Again Chaotic <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>The US's Nationalistic Policy of Stabilizing Currency Has Failed</p>
<p>The British Prime Minister Expresses Willingness to Work Towards Reconciliation to Finally Achieve a Currency Truce</p>
<p>(London) The declaration issued yesterday by the US delegation that a temporary currency stabilization plan is currently untimely has thrown the World Economic Conference into a state of disarray. Today, the situation remains the same. All parties acknowledge the failure to establish a currency stabilization plan with the US. The most serious aspect of the situation is the talk of postponing the current conference, but this is not favored by official circles. The British side hopes that the current intransigence is only temporary and that internal conditions will improve in a few weeks, making a compromise possible. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd) (London) The sharp conflict between the French and American delegations regarding the issue of currency stabilization still exists. France is demanding that the US agree to immediate partial stabilization, but the US delegation seems to still be awaiting instructions from the US President. French Finance Minister Bonnet has stated that a currency stabilization agreement must be concluded before all other agreements, and explained that the urgency of concluding this agreement has led to the recent resurgence of rumors that France intends to abandon the gold standard if the exchange rate of the US dollar is not firm. This rumor has affected all major securities markets in the world, causing prices to fluctuate. However, the French delegation has remained silent on this rumor. The French representative also pointed out that the US's refusal to agree to immediate stabilization has left the world's currency prices in the hands of speculators. However, the US representative did not want to comment on this. In short, at present, within the Economic Conference, only the silver issue has made progress. Other issues are still waiting for the right moment. The time when agreements on tariffs and other trade barriers can be reached is likely still far away. (National Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) US officials claim that a temporary currency stabilization plan is currently untimely. The atmosphere surrounding the difficult issue of currency stabilization at the World Economic Conference has been slightly clarified by this statement. According to members of the US official circle, temporary stabilization may cause a sharp drop in prices, which would defeat the US's plan to raise prices. The US official circle also revealed that the US has submitted a proposal advocating a consistent monetary policy to promote economic activity and increase prices to achieve the ultimate stability of unstable currencies. The US official circle's release of this statement after receiving secret instructions from Washington shows that President Roosevelt has officially begun a nationalistic policy. However, it is heard that the US delegation, because France attaches great importance to currency stability, will use currency stability as a tool for future negotiations until other economic plans have been considered. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) British Prime Minister MacDonald told reporters this afternoon that greater momentum and internal strength must be injected into the World Conference, as was done in the first week. Next week, the third week, will be a period for all parties to do their best to reconcile with each other. This should make everyone aware of the importance of the work ahead. International conferences often become pessimistic in the second week, but the World Economic Conference is not like that this week, he said. MacDonald continued, "I am now optimistic as we enter the third week. In the past, I felt somewhat discouraged when the fate of the Lausanne Conference was uncertain, but that is not the case today." There have been some setbacks in the past week, especially regarding the hope for temporary currency stabilization, but this is not a major concern. The US's position is indeed difficult. The US is currently engaged in raising its domestic prices. Anything at the conference that could hinder the rise in prices is not something the US wants. The situation after yesterday is neither completely gloomy nor without any certainty. The talk of postponing the conference is foolish, as this would only lead to the conference breaking up. Nothing could have a worse impact on the determination of countries to find a solution. The excessive workload of the secretariat is only a minor obstacle, as there is much to be done and the secretariat's organization is insufficient to cope with it. During consultations in subcommittees, all parties can still exchange views on currency stabilization. When we reach a stage of mutual understanding and cooperation, we will see that the conference has value in continuing to meet. MacDonald concluded his speech with a sincere attitude: "We must revive our spirit of action, and we must have the driving force." (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<p>But Business and Industry Are Not Very Supportive</p>
<p>(Washington) The US President's nationalistic method of supporting the recovery of industry and commerce, in contrast to Europe's plan to encourage industry and commerce through international cooperation, seems to have created a deadlock at the Economic Conference. Recently, more and more people have held this view. Some newspapers claim that the President, even if he wants to cooperate enthusiastically in London, is still determined to maintain the gains he has made domestically using purely nationalistic methods. According to financial circles, the recent rise in commodity securities is mostly due to the devaluation of the gold standard. Once this artificially inflated price falls, it is feared that it will cause political turmoil. Currently, the strongest supporters of the US President are the farmers, who have greatly benefited from the inflated currency plan and the artificial raising of prices. In addition, although prices have risen, wages have not increased correspondingly, and the number of unemployed has not decreased correspondingly. Therefore, the President's intention is to maintain the support of the farmers at this time. Today, agricultural groups in Washington all support the US delegation's declaration in London, believing that the US's raising of prices domestically will be more beneficial to the world than agreeing to temporary exchange rate stabilization. However, according to Wall Street sources, the banking and manufacturing industries have not been able to endorse this attitude, believing that continuing to prepare to use nationalistic methods to revive industry and commerce cannot be reconciled with efforts to achieve international cooperation. It is expected that if an agreement cannot be reached in London that is consistent with the methods used by the President to date, then the President will retreat and implement a nationalistic economic policy, relying on his extensive powers to protect domestic industry and commerce. Furthermore, although the value of the gold standard has fallen in the past two days, the prices of securities and commodities have still fallen due to the uncertainty of the situation at the London Conference. Observers in New York are concerned about this decline, fearing that once the artificially inflated prices fall, political turmoil will follow. (National Telegram, 22nd)</p>

<p>(London) It is heard that various morning newspapers are greatly disappointed with the suggestions made by the United States yesterday (i.e., abolishing artificial trade barriers). The Times stated that most delegations regarded currency stabilization as the primary mission. The newspaper stated, "The devaluation of currency is too great to allow prices to rise in the same proportion as the US dollar. The drop in prices is already irreversible. If currency continues to depreciate, then the drop in prices should be even greater than it is today." The Times financial supplement stated that people in financial circles believe that if the currency stabilization problem cannot be resolved for even a day, then the World Economic Conference will not have any effect for even a day. Some even advocate temporarily postponing the Economic Conference until the fall, and having a committee carry out preparatory work in the meantime. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>British-Russian Trade Negotiations Revived</p>
<p>(London) Today, British Prime Minister MacDonald held a tea party. Soviet Russian representative Litvinov attended with his wife. The hope for British-Russian negotiations is thus revived, as the British ban on Russian imports and the imprisonment of two British employees of Vickers Company in Russia both need to be resolved. The Russian authorities previously accused the two British employees of Vickers Company of espionage and sabotage and sentenced them to two to three years of imprisonment on April 18. The British authorities considered this unfair and retaliated by banning Russian imports. This is why Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov issued sarcastic remarks during the opening of the Economic Conference. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) Attention is being paid here to British Prime Minister MacDonald's invitation to Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov and eleven others to a luncheon this afternoon. Litvinov told reporters before attending the banquet that Soviet Russia would only consider releasing the imprisoned two British engineers after Britain cancelled the ban on trade with Russia. It is now believed that the British Prime Minister will first launch talks on the issue of ending the British-Russian trade war during the luncheon. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>

<p>(Currency and Silver Group)</p>
<p>Nine Countries Form a Special Committee</p>
<p>To Negotiate a Plan to Stabilize Silver Prices</p>
<p>(London) Today, the Silver Group Committee of the Currency Committee spent the entire day in detailed and frank discussions of the draft proposal submitted by US representative Pittman. It was felt that an understanding between the major silver-producing countries and the countries storing large amounts of silver was a necessary condition for the success of the agreement. During today's meeting, a special committee was established. Representatives from the United States, Mexico, Canada, Argentina, Peru, and Bolivia handled the adjustment of the silver supply, and representatives from China, India, and Spain considered the issue of restricting the flow of government silver reserves into the market. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) An agreement to stabilize silver prices between the major silver-producing countries and silver-storing countries is expected to begin drafting soon. The Silver Subcommittee has nominated a special committee to negotiate a detailed stabilization plan, which will be submitted to the Subcommittee for approval and then transferred to the plenary session of the conference.

<p>(Nanjing) During the World Economic Conference, the silver issue is also an important case for discussion. Central News Agency reporters believe that the silver issue is most closely related to our country. On the 23rd, they interviewed Ma Yinchu, Chairman of the Finance Committee of the Legislative Yuan, for his opinion. According to Ma, the great powers want to raise silver prices and will inevitably abandon the gold standard and inflate the currency in order to restore world economic prosperity, and then silver prices will rise. However, according to economic trends, the cycle of successive panic is still likely to reappear one day, and silver prices will eventually fall again. (Central News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>

The Hungarian representative, Imredy, argued that a compromise should be reached with foreign governments and foreign creditors so that creditor countries could directly revise debts through judicial means. The Romanian Finance Minister requested a change in debt contracts to reduce debt immediately and permanently. The Turkish representative argued that agreements should be signed between creditor and debtor countries to repay debts in kind. The Ecuadorian delegation hoped to establish an international public fund to allow countries to re-borrow. The Greek representative argued that commercial agreements should be signed between major creditor countries and small debtor countries. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>(London) The main committee of the Economic Conference met today, chaired by British Prime Minister MacDonald, to review the inertia of the Economic Conference. It is generally believed that the two committees on currency and brokerage will continue to discuss tomorrow, but the final agreement must wait until the US dollar is finally stabilized before it can be established. The first session of the Economic Conference seems to be proceeding until July. The second session may be delayed until October so that the two committees can take advantage of the interval to remove obstacles to the conference. It is generally hoped that the examination of the US currency inflation policy will be completed before the second session opens. The reason for delaying this meeting is that the United States expressed its opposition to stabilizing the currency this morning. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)</p>

Such plans or drafts should obtain the consent of the general producing countries, and within each producing country, the majority of producers should approve them. The approach should be fair to both producers and consumers and should be sufficiently effective to make all parties feel safe. The above principles are influenced by the declaration of British Colonial Secretary Lister. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>(London) Today, the representative of the Irish Free State launched a major attack on Britain's commercial policy in the Trade Tariff Subcommittee of the World Economic Conference. He claimed that Britain, for revenge, deliberately destroyed the economy of the Free State and attempted to overthrow the government of the Free State. Therefore, if hostility between Britain and Ireland is to persist forever, then the so-called tariff coordinator will never have any hope of existing. For the sake of world economic independence, such tariffs used by large countries to punish small countries must be announced at the World Economic Conference. After publicly attacking the British government, the Irish representative dispersed his speech to reporters, and the atmosphere in the meeting hall became very tense for a while, because the debate of the various countries' agreement subcommittees should be treated as a secret discussion.

<p>After the Establishment of the Four-Power Pact, Mussolini Launched the Danube Economic Alliance</p>
<p>Rumors of Austro-Hungarian Restoration Are Rife</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 22nd - Officials here today dismiss recent rumors about plans to restore the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, saying that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has never sought Paris's opinion on this matter. In fact, what he seeks is a form of economic agreement, wanting to include the Danube countries in an association of good fellowship. The second step, of course, would be a meeting between French Prime Minister Daladier and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, but this meeting may not be realized in a short time.</p>
<p>Reuters, Budapest, 22nd - Rumors that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has proposed plans to the major powers to restore the Austro-Hungarian monarchy have been dismissed by officials here today as unfounded. They claim that Hungarian Prime Minister Gombos recently stated that such a federation belonging to the past is not what Hungary needs, and the whole country agrees with this statement.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 22nd - Rumors that Italy and France are currently discussing plans for a Hungarian-Austrian union have been denied by French officials. Paris Evening Post published an article commenting on the matter, saying that France has always been closely associated with the Little Entente countries. If it promotes Hungarian-Austrian rapprochement, then France's views will deviate from those of the Little Entente countries, which is definitely not what Foreign Minister Pang Gu wants to do. According to the views of French political figures, the only way to organize Central Europe is to establish a broad economic compromise, allowing all countries in the Danube region to join.</p>
<p>Havas, London, 22nd - Those close to the Hungarian delegation to the London Economic Conference have firmly denied rumors that Hungary is currently considering restoration. British officials said that foreign rumors that Italian diplomatic authorities have contacted the British Foreign Office regarding the Hungarian-Austrian union issue are not true. The United Kingdom is in a dilemma regarding this matter: one is to allow Hungary to restore the monarchy and unite with Austria, and the other is to allow Germany and Austria to unite. However, the general public trusts Austria, saying that it will definitely be able to defend its independence and will not unite with Germany. However, Austria's attitude may not last long. The United Kingdom seems to intend to advocate an economic construction plan, so that the countries formed after the division of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire can unite economically and maintain their political autonomy.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 23rd - Foreign Minister Pang Gu met with Yugoslav Foreign Minister Yefudichu. After the meeting, Yefu said that the matters discussed were related to the Central European issue. When asked about the Habsburg royal family's restoration movement in Hungary, Yefu replied that this matter was not mentioned.</p>
<p>National News, Paris, 23rd - According to a report from Rome, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is now urging German Chancellor Hitler, French Prime Minister Daladier, and British Prime Minister MacDonald to come to Rome to sign the Four-Power Pact. The date will be around mid-next month.</p>
<p>Hitler's Reaction</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 23rd - All Christian trade unions in Germany cease to exist from today. Dr. Lai, the national commissioner for the protection of workers' interests, has issued an order to expel all former leaders of Christian trade unions and replace them with figures from the National Socialist Party. This is the second order from Germany interfering in workers' organizations. The first order was issued on May 2nd, temporarily confiscating the bank accounts of free trade unions for investigation. At that time, Dr. Lai stated that the National Socialist Party must take over the trade unions to protect the interests of workers. All Christian and other non-socialist trade unions must also recognize the new order, otherwise they will be dissolved. The government's goal is to unify all associations.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 22nd - The Socialist Party within Germany is now suffering a severe blow. One hundred and twenty Socialist Party members of parliament, state parliaments, and city councils have been ordered to be suspended from their positions and immediately cease receiving salaries. Socialist Party gatherings and newspapers have been banned, and the party's property and funds have also been confiscated. At the same time, the government has ordered that all civil servants are not allowed to join the Socialist Party from today. The government announced today that the German Socialist Party has absolute evidence of a conspiracy to overthrow the government, and claimed that the leaders of the Socialist Party have plans to resist the government. Prussian Interior Minister Goering today instructed all federal governments to take the same steps against the Socialist Party to protect the people and the country.</p>
<p>National News, Berlin, 22nd - In recent days, the government has collected various information from independent sources, proving that the Social Democratic Party is indeed continuing its treasonous activities. Therefore, it has been decided to dissolve the party as a whole and prohibit it from reorganizing. The Social Democratic Party members in parliament will also be removed from their positions. All propaganda materials and gatherings of the party will be banned, and the newspapers and journals belonging to the party will be permanently suspended. All party fees will be confiscated, and all civil servants will not be allowed to belong to the party in the future.</p>
<p>National News, Berlin, 22nd - According to a news agency related to Hu Zhenpei, Hu claimed that he still cannot agree with the reasons given by the government for dissolving the Fenmen Corps. He has expressed his position to certain important figures. According to the Berlin Daily News, this statement was clearly allowed to be published by Hu. This proves that there is an extraordinary plan outside the cabinet to deal with the Fenmen Corps. However, the opinions among the cabinet members are very different and difficult to reconcile.</p>
<p>Reuters, Munich, 23rd - The tombstones of Eisner, who was the prime minister when the Bavarian Communist Party came to power in 1919, and Landauer, the Communist Party leader who was shot, were all destroyed today in accordance with the orders of the city council. The ashes of the two men will be preserved by Jewish religious leaders. The city council announced the reason for this, saying that it had recently been discovered that someone was plotting to blow up Eisner's tomb. Eisner was a famous journalist and wrote many books on art, drama, and sociology. He gained fame at the Berlin Academy of Philosophy and Germanic Literature. In his youth, he wrote "Nietzsche's Doctrine," which was highly regarded. From 1892, he worked as a reporter for the Frankfurter Zeitung. In 1897, he was sentenced to nine months in prison for promoting socialism. At the end of the European War, he organized a bloodless civil revolution in Bavaria. After King Ludwig abdicated, he served as prime minister. In early 1919, he was killed by Spartacist soldiers. His book "The Sultan of World War" predicted the World War.</p>
<p>Japan Asks the UK for Opinions on Negotiations with India</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 23rd - This morning, Foreign Minister Uchida consulted with the heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the issue of Japanese-Indian trade. As a result, he will send the following telegram to Ambassador Matsudaira in the UK, proposing that Japan and India begin direct negotiations and questioning the UK government's true intentions. The Japanese government hopes that official diplomatic negotiations will begin in Shimla by representatives of Japan and India. Does the UK government intend to give the Indian government the authority to negotiate this matter? What is the nature of the confirmation that the UK government will give as a result of the negotiations? Because the negotiations must be extensive, the Japanese government hopes that the UK government will reply quickly.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 23rd - The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs attaches importance to whether the UK government's confirmation of the results of the Japanese-Indian negotiations is formal or substantive. Therefore, it has telegraphed Ambassador Matsudaira in the UK separately. If it is substantive, the negotiations in Shimla may be overturned in London. Therefore, the UK government's reply will have a great impact on the future of the Japanese-Indian issue and deserves close attention.</p>
<p>Japan Alliance News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd - The Japanese government has decided to appoint Minister Sawada as the chief representative for the negotiations on the Japanese-Indian issue, and Director Takeuchi of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and Consul-General Miyake stationed in India as representatives. The order to depart will be issued in mid-July, and the negotiations will begin in early August.</p>
<p>Japan Establishes Transportation Conference, Close Liaison Between the Navy and Army</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 23rd - Today's regular cabinet meeting was held at the Prime Minister's official residence at 10 a.m. All cabinet members attended except for Naval Minister Osumi. Army Minister Araki explained the establishment of the Transportation Conference, saying that it would not be based on the budget or official system, but a committee would be established by the relevant ministries to hold meetings. The results would be reviewed and decided by the cabinet. After discussions, it was decided to establish a transportation conference to establish fundamental policies for overall transportation. Because the relevant ministries must take contact, it was officially decided to establish a transportation conference. The cabinet will draft a concrete plan for its organization, staffing, and other specific details.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 23rd - The administrative vice-ministers of each ministry held a meeting at the Prime Minister's official residence yesterday to discuss the establishment of the Transportation Conference proposed by Army Minister Araki. As a result, it was decided that the Railway Conference and Civil Engineering Conference would remain in existence, and a large-scale Transportation Conference would be established above them. The specific plan will be drafted by the Legal Bureau.</p>
<p>Japan Alliance News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd - Yesterday, the administrative vice-ministers of each ministry discussed the establishment of the Transportation Conference advocated by Army Minister Araki. According to Army Minister Araki's original proposal, a unified transportation conference would be established to link the various transportation facilities under the jurisdiction of each ministry, with the aim of establishing a comprehensive national defense transportation policy for the army, navy, and air force. As a result of the exchange of opinions among the vice-ministers, they all expressed their agreement. However, the following specific methods will be submitted to the Legal Bureau for preparation as soon as possible and submitted to the next meeting for decision: (1) How to deal with the existing railway, civil engineering, and other conferences in terms of their existence and authority after the establishment of the Transportation Conference; (2) How to deal with the funding issue; the second reserve fund for this year has been exhausted, and should it be included in the new budget for next year; (3) How should the organization and organization methods of this agency be structured; should the Prime Minister be appointed as the chairman or should transportation experts be sought from the government and private sectors; (4) Should it be a permanent agency.</p>
<p>Negotiations on Joint Transportation Between the Chinese Eastern Railway and the Ussuri Railway Have Stalled</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 22nd - According to letters received here from Bo Li, the Ussuri Railway Council has decided to stop its negotiations with the South Manchurian Railway on signing an agreement on cargo transportation, distribution, and freight rates. It has withdrawn its representative, Mr. Kirshanov, who participated in the negotiations. Since the end of May, the joint transportation between the Chinese Eastern Railway and the Ussuri Railway has been cut off by the orders of the "Manchukuo" authorities. As a result, as of June 13, 287 carriages of soybeans and 149 carriages of various imported goods scheduled to be transported by the Chinese Eastern Railway were piled up at the Suifenhe Station.</p>
<p>British Non-War Movement</p>
<p>National News, Edinburgh, 22nd - After a heated debate today, the British League of Nations Union passed all resolutions opposing world war. Because the chairman of the association is Sir Cecil, the resolutions passed this time are particularly important. According to the resolution, British soldiers in the army, navy, and air force can refuse to obey the orders of their superiors during wartime if the war has been deemed illegal by the League of Nations. The resolution was initially proposed by a small number of people, but it was passed by a large majority of 290 votes to 10 votes. However, Cecil believed that this resolution seemed to encourage betrayal in the army. Therefore, he wanted to propose another solution, that is, all members of the British League of Nations Union should use the power of legal means to prevent the progress of such a war when they encounter an illegal war, and at the same time refuse any actions that support this war. This resolution was also passed unanimously.</p>

<p>Fang Zhenwu and Others Telegraph Four Provinces, This Heart Will Not Change</p>
<p>Fang Zhenwu and others telegraphed on the 20th: "To all provinces, cities, legal entities, newspapers, and the people of the country: Since the September 18th Incident, the people of the whole country have risen up in anger. Zhenwu and others are pained by the fragmentation of the country and know that every man has a responsibility. They cried and raised troops, and jointly raised the banner of justice, unanimously supporting Commander-in-Chief Feng Huanzhang to preside over everything. With the struggle of a lone army, they acted as the vanguard of the people. They firmly know that right and wrong have been obscured for a long time. However, Zhenwu and others are concerned with the great cause and will not consider the pros and cons. They have been determined to die since the day they raised the banner of justice. In the past two weeks, they have gathered troops to inspect the territory and inspired tired soldiers to jointly make plans for recovery. Zhenwu and others are fighting for the survival of the nation and rising up at the request of the people. They dare to express their heartfelt feelings to the people of the country. All those who are on the same front as us are our friends, and all those who are on the same front as the enemy are our enemies. We will accept any slander and will not seek to preserve our lives at the expense of our principles. Now, we respectfully lead the soldiers of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army to follow Commander-in-Chief Feng and reorganize the army of justice, pointing north to regain the lost territories of the four provinces and then attempt to return our mountains and rivers. We vow to stain the autumn grass outside the Great Wall with the blood of soldiers. If the four provinces are not recovered, this heart will not change. We hope that the people of the whole country will rise up together to plan for it. Commander-in-Chief Fang Zhenwu, Sun Liangcheng, Commander of the First Army Tong Linge, Commander of the Fifth Route Army Deng Wen, Commander of the Second Army Ji Hongchang, Commander of the Self-Defense Army Zhang Yansheng, Commander of the Fifth Army Ruan Xuanwu, Commander Zhang Renjie, Bao Gang, Mi Wenhe, Commander of the Second Vanguard Army Gao Shudong, Commander of the First Vanguard Army Lei Zhongtian, Commander of the Sixteenth Army Li Zhongyi, Commander of the First Route Army Yu Renong, Commander of the Guerrilla Wang Ying, Commander of the Second Division Zhi Yinglin, Commander of the First Division Peng Guozheng, Commanders Song Tielin, Du Guangming, Fu Chunfu, Guan Jun, Li Haishan, Qiao Mingli, Liu Zibin, Liu Zhenyu, and Wang Zhongfu respectfully salute with all officers and soldiers."</p>

<p>The Chahar Province Issue Still Has Complications</p>
<p>Feng Is Willing to Resist Japan and Save the Country as a Civilian</p>
<p>Fang Zhenwu, Sun Dianying, and Other Troops Still Need to Be Settled</p>
<p>Beiping Special Correspondence: The Chahar matter has been resolved through seven measures proposed by Feng Xiang in a personal letter to Song Zheyuan. For several days, the local authorities here have been seeking a solution through this path. There has been no news from Zhangjiakou. The central government has already decided on Feng's title as the National Afforestation and Reclamation Director and will issue it after seeking Feng's consent. However, Feng's attitude has been silent and unexpressed. On the 19th of this month, the people of Zhangjiakou held a civic conference. Feng personally attended the lecture and then expressed to people, "I am willing to resist Japan and save the country as an ordinary person. I don't want to be an official during this period." His singing and demeanor were meant to convey his thoughts. Whether he is willing to take the new position is still difficult to say. He Yingqin and Huang Fu believe that Song Zheyuan's mediation was mostly responsible for the peaceful handling of the Chahar matter this time. Therefore, the responsibility for all negotiations has been entrusted to Song, Zhang Jiyong, Lei Jishang, Deng Xizhe, and others. At more than 11:00 am yesterday (21st), they once again went to Chahar to meet Feng on Song's orders for final consultations. They arrived in Zhangjiakou at about 9:00 pm that night. It was heard that Feng eagerly hoped that Song would return to Chahar as soon as possible so that the Chahar provincial government affairs could be handed over. His attitude was extremely sincere. As for the cancellation of the title of Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Japanese Army, it will be decided after there is a way to maintain order in Chahar Province. Military and political issues are still extremely complicated and cannot be resolved in a few words. After a brief discussion, no results were obtained. This morning (22nd) at 6:00 am, Feng again invited representatives and Tong Linge, Ji Hongchang, Fang Zhenwu, and others to discuss all the aftermath in Xincun. Fang Zhenwu's attitude was particularly激昂 (excited) and he still expressed his unchanged anti-Japanese stance. How his troops will be settled has not been discussed and there is no proper way. Feng left the representatives in Zhangjiakou for three to five days so that they could discuss it at any time. Zhang and others decided to delay their return date and intend to discuss the troops stationed in Chahar Province and Feng's future at length. This morning, a certain representative has telegraphed to report on his visit to Feng. The authorities still maintain an optimistic attitude towards this and are seeking further peaceful methods to end the Chahar matter as soon as possible. Song Zheyuan went to Jurentang at 10:00 am this morning to meet He Yingqin and reported what he knew. In the evening, he continued to discuss it. Song originally intended to go to Guanyintang today to reorganize the troops, but he also changed his schedule and will depart tomorrow (23rd) morning. The troops recently recruited by Feng in the Zhangjiakou area are very large in number. The troops under his direct command include Ji Hongchang, Tong Linge, Gao Shuxun, Zhang Lisheng, Liu Guitang, Deng Wen, Fu Chun, Li Haiqing, and Liu Zhendong. Liu Guitang was only recently recruited by Feng and is still stationed in the Binchang Kangbao area. Feng has reorganized the troops into ten armies, with a total of about 60,000 people. According to news released by relevant parties, bandits such as Wang Shiming near Kangbao have been recruited by Feng and appointed Wang as a division commander, transferred to the suburbs of Zhangjiakou, and temporarily stationed in Dongpu, intending to be under the command of Tong Linge. The daily food expenses are estimated at 35,000 yuan, and the monthly expenses are more than 1 million yuan. These troops will all be handed over to Song Zheyuan in the future. It is very difficult to raise enough military expenses. Moreover, Fang Zhenwu's troops are not included, because Fang and Feng were difficult to raise troops for the same anti-Japanese cause. Although the goals are the same, the organizations are different. How to deal with them in the future still depends on Song's efforts to mediate. Currently, the list of provincial government members and heads of various departments in Chahar Province has been drafted by Song. Fang Zhenwu was originally intended to be appointed as a provincial committee member, but it has recently been slightly changed. It is roughly estimated that Qin Dechun will be the head of the Department of Civil Affairs, Guo Zhihan will be the head of the Department of Finance, Zhang Jiyong will be the head of the Department of Construction, Zheng Dayu will be the head of the Department of Education, and Yang Zhennan will be the secretary-general of the provincial government. It can be issued after the Executive Yuan meeting approves it. When will Song return to Chahar? It was originally scheduled to be within ten days, but now the situation is different and may be extended. At the earliest, it will have to wait until the title of Forest Reclamation Director is issued before he can set off. Song's three divisions, Liu Ruming, Feng Zhian, and Zhang Zizhong, suffered heavy losses in the anti-Japanese war and are temporarily stationed in Tongdong to supplement their forces. Only Zhang Zizhong's troops have largely maintained their strength. Song intends to order the division to advance into Chahar first. Troops such as Pang Bingdong will also enter Chahar with Song in the future. Pang will serve as the commander of the Chahar bandit suppression. The Military Branch Council has officially issued orders last night. Li Fuhe's cavalry fifth division of the 40th Army and other troops are stationed in Gaobeidian and other places. The location of the garrison after entering Chahar must also be designated by Song. It is still difficult to move out for a while. In addition, Sun Dianying's Qinghai Reclamation Director has not yet been issued an order by the central government. Sun Dianying's troops are currently stationed near Shacheng. Because the troops participated in the war, they increased to nine regiments. Moving troops for reclamation is quite difficult. The people of Qinghai Province once petitioned the chairman of the province, Ma Lin, on the 20th of this month, saying that the land is barren and the people are poor, and that it is unbearable to suddenly increase the number of troops. They requested that it be submitted to the government to revoke this proposal. Therefore, even if Sun's troops are willing to raise funds for the departure themselves, there will still be obstacles. In addition to this, it is even more difficult to settle them. Judging from this, the Chahar Province issue is really very complicated and disputes are feared to be inevitable. It is estimated that Feng will not leave Zhangjiakou in the shortest period of time and move to Wanquan. Zhang Jiyong and others also brought it up when they visited Feng, but Feng believed that he had the freedom to live wherever he wanted and had no intention of returning. (June 22)</p>
<p>The Japanese Protect the Puppet Army, Difficulties in Receiving the War Zone</p>
<p>The Japanese Army in the West Continues to Withdraw</p>
<p>There Is No Movement in the East</p>
<p>The Puppet Army in Eastern Luan Acts Rampantly</p>
<p>Actively Expanding Its Strength</p>
<p>Beiping Special News: The Tanggu Truce Agreement not only did not stipulate the complete withdrawal of the Japanese army, but also gave the Japanese side the convenience of maneuvering and delaying between the lines. Therefore, more than two weeks have passed since the signing, and the withdrawal area is less than 10%. At the same time, the puppet army on both sides of the Luan River has been sheltered, actively expanding, and increasingly spreading. The consequences are endless. Since the Japanese army in Tongdong withdrew to the territory of Sanhe County, they have withdrawn from Sanhe to the area of ​​Xiacun Town in Jixian County. As of today (22nd), there is no trace of the Japanese army in Sanhe. The withdrawal of the Japanese army on this route is slightly better than that of other routes. After the Japanese army withdrew from the territory of Shunyi County, they went to Niulanshan to harass the local public security bureau chief and ordered the Chamber of Commerce to select people to take over within three days. Now that the three days have passed, although the Japanese army has not moved forward to urge them, people are panic-stricken and cannot live in peace. There is no difference between withdrawing and not withdrawing. As for the eastern route, the Japanese army has not moved at all. When will they withdraw is even more remote. The Japanese army is slow to withdraw, and our reception cannot proceed. The issue of the puppet army that lies in between is even more mutually causal and falls into a dead end. The Japanese army has nothing to love about the general traitors, but in order to facilitate their private plans, they secretly protect them. When the truce agreement was signed, they claimed that they would wait for future private consultations to resolve the issue. Later, after several consultations in Beiping, the Japanese representative Yongjin had no definite expression. This time, when the Political Reorganization Association was established, Yu Han and others gathered in Beiping. Yu once proposed a plan to resolve the issue of the puppet army. After public resolution, it was handed over to He Huang to earnestly negotiate with the Japanese side. A few days ago, He Huang had presented it to the Japanese representative Yongjin for discussion. Yongjin promised to convey our opinions to General Muto of the Kwantung Army for his consent. But after many days, there has been no reply, and for a time it has fallen into a standstill. The authorities believe that this matter is urgent and intend to negotiate with Yongjin again and repeatedly inquire Muto and hope that the Japanese side will earnestly implement the truce agreement. The purpose of the puppet army is to be recruited by us and still stationed in the original place to fulfill its private wishes to occupy eastern Luan. Regarding the number of people, they hope to leave at least 10,000 people and form an army. In order to quell the incident and seek perfection, our side has some room for negotiation on the issue of recruitment. However, there is a great need to consider the number of people and the location of the garrison. At the highest limit, it can only be reorganized into an independent brigade, and the number of people must not exceed 5,000. After recruitment, they should be transferred to another place to carry out the reorganization of the war zone. The puppet army strongly disagrees with this point, and the Japanese side also protects them wholeheartedly. Since the recruitment negotiations have not yielded results, the puppet army has further expanded its organization, recruiting gangsters, bandits, and scattered soldiers from western Luan, and righteous troops from various places in Rehe to expand its establishment, dividing them into six routes, appointing commanders of each route, and establishing a pseudo-organization, arbitrarily appointing county magistrates. The area where the Japanese army withdraws is immediately received by people sent by the puppet army, which seems to create a special force, which is a great obstacle to the reception of the war zone. The puppet army of Li Jichun, Zhao Lei, and others was only 3,000 to 4,000 people before, but as a result of vigorous expansion, it has increased to 5,000 to 6,000 people. According to their claim, it is no less than 90,000. Moreover, Shi Yusan and others are still very active in Qinhuangdao, and their ambitions seem to be not small. If measures are not taken early to solve the problem once and for all, it will not only be difficult to curb the spread, but also the area is close to Tianjin, and it is inevitable that it will be a cause for concern. Our reception of the war zone is delayed due to the delay of the Japanese army's withdrawal and the failure to resolve the issue of the puppet army. The areas where the Japanese army has withdrawn from Tongzhou and Shunyi are temporarily maintained by local security teams and police. It was originally intended to organize 10,000 special police officers to maintain the security of various counties in eastern Luan and northern Hebei. However, due to the difficulty in raising police salaries, it has been temporarily shelved. We will first expand and reorganize the police militia and security teams in various counties to give them the strength to suppress bandits and protect the people, with the principle of not increasing expenses. As for war zone relief, the central government plans to raise 10 million yuan, and all taxes and miscellaneous donations for the current busy season will be exempted. Whether or not the next busy season will be exempted will depend on future circumstances. (June 22)</p>
<p>Wuchang and Hanyang Are Flooded at the Same Time</p>
<p>The Yangtze River Has Risen to Four Feet and Six Inches in Recent Days</p>
<p>The Provincial Capital Flood Prevention Association Was Established and Began to Work</p>
<p>The Main Embankment Along the Yangtze River in Shishou Collapsed, Affecting the People's Embankment</p>
<p>The Streets of Xindi Were Flooded, and the Army and People Jointly Carried Out Rescue Efforts</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since the beginning of summer this year, there has been continuous rain for ten days, and the rivers have risen. The direct pouring of the buildings and the lack of communication at the end of the tail make it difficult to escape the great disaster. Wuhan is located at the confluence of the Yangtze River and the Han River, and the situation is particularly dangerous. The collapse of the Jinshui Dam the day before yesterday has already caused a major disaster. The other embankments and sluice gates of Wufeng, Wuhui, Wutai, Wuqing, Changfeng, etc. either have water leaks in the stone foundations or weak embankments, and the flood is still pouring out. On the 21st, all the embankments reported that they were in critical condition, but they were able to stay safe due to strict protection. At more than 2:00 am on the 22nd, there was suddenly a strange wind, flying sand and rocks, which was almost dangerous, but fortunately it stopped in a few minutes and turned the danger into safety again. But after the gale, the Yangtze River rose sharply. The water rose seven inches in half a day, and another three inches in the evening. The water mark was four feet and six inches, and the distance from the Hankou River bank was only a few inches, and the higher places were only more than one foot. The main sewers in the Japanese Concession were already flooded due to the low-lying location and the incomplete flood control dam. On this day, the sewers were specially closed and started to be discharged. The flood control</p>

<p>Last Night's Bombing on Rue de la République</p>
<p>Wah Lih Shih Umbrella Shop</p>
<p>Two Employees Injured in the Legs</p>
<p>The Wah Lih Shih Umbrella Factory Outlet, located at 366-367 Rue de la République in the French Concession, has been in operation for eight years. The factory was initially established on Foochow Road within the city, and a large-scale raw material factory was established on Avenue Paul Henrys in the French Concession in 1925. Business had been thriving, but last night at 8:05 PM, someone threw a hand grenade from the street into the shop. It exploded immediately with a loud bang, shaking the neighborhood. Mao Longhai (21 years old), a shop assistant from Qingjiang, sustained injuries to his right leg, and Qian Daosheng (28 years old), a clerk from Jiangbei, was wounded in his right foot. Wooden displays and an iron cart with a wooden cover were also damaged. The shop manager, Zhu Shunbao, reported the incident to the Great Self-Ringing Clock Police Station. The head of the station immediately dispatched detectives to investigate. They collected the fragments of the exploded grenade and stored them at the police station for further investigation.</p>
<p>Former Police Officer Ma Wenxiang Commits Suicide by Train Due to Patriotic Concerns</p>
<p>Unable to Reconcile Loyalty and Filial Piety, He Chooses Death</p>
<p>His Hatred for the Japanese Remains Unassuaged Despite Hand-to-Hand Combat</p>
<p>Ma Wenxiang, a 29-year-old native of Dongchang Prefecture, Shandong Province, previously served as a second-class police officer in the third squad of the second company of the Municipal Police Bureau, stationed in Caoh Jing Town in western Shanghai. Ma was known for his honesty, filial piety, and bravery. In the autumn of 1930, he invited his father, Ma Haoyou, 57 years old, who had only Wenxiang as his child, to come to Shanghai. After arriving in Shanghai, Ma Haoyou was introduced to work as a janitor at the New Longhua Hui Ling English School. Before the January 28th Incident two years ago, the squad was ordered to move to the front lines in Zhabei. Ma also participated in the resistance against the Japanese, engaging in hand-to-hand combat for a week. Eventually, he was transferred to the Bund and Caojiadu, among other locations. Last autumn, the squad was ordered to reorganize, and Ma subsequently retired and returned home, living with his father at the Hui Ling School in western Shanghai. At that time, the Japanese were invading Manchuria, and Wenxiang repeatedly expressed his desire to go north to join the volunteer army to fight the enemy. However, his elderly father refused, and he was unable to fulfill his wish, causing him great frustration. He became depressed and fell ill, remaining bedridden for several months until this spring. Wenxiang was aware that the eastern provinces had been lost and North China was in turmoil. He made a second request to his father, but his father questioned who would care for him in his old age. Wenxiang had no choice but to give up, but he sighed and lamented all day, often singing that he could not reconcile loyalty and filial piety. The students at the school ridiculed him. In March, Wenxiang attempted suicide by drowning but was rescued by fellow villagers and survived. However, his old illness relapsed, causing a nervous breakdown. After undergoing several treatments, he recovered last month. When Wenxiang was stationed in Zhabei during the tense war, he still took leave to visit his father, so his father loved him very much. The father and son did not want to be separated. Last week, Haoyou handed over his job at the school to Wenxiang and went to work as a cook at the Second Prison in Caohejing. Unexpectedly, Wenxiang went out alone around 9 PM on the evening before last (June 22nd) and committed suicide on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway in front of the Xinzhai Gate (about 200 yards northwest of the Hui Ling School, the same location where Gai Jianye, a graduate of Hui Ling High School, committed suicide on the morning of June 24, 1931). He was discovered yesterday morning, having been crushed to death by a night express train at 10:30 PM the night before. His left foot was severed, and his body was dismembered, a gruesome sight to behold. When reporters heard the news and drove to the countryside to investigate, the body was still lying on the muddy road north of the railway track, and the father of the deceased, Ma Haoyou, was weeping beside it. The old man's lamentations were heartbreaking. He provided the reporter with details about the deceased's life, noting that his aspirations were commendable, and his situation was indeed distressing. Yang Xinzheng, a municipal affairs committee member in the district, took pity on him and provided a coffin. The body was collected at 5 PM. The father of the deceased reported the matter to the Sixth District Third Sub-Bureau, requesting an exemption from an autopsy.</p>

<p>Recently, the Shanghai Power Company discovered that some users were colluding with mechanics to engage in large-scale electricity theft. The company reported this to the police station, requesting an investigation. Under the supervision of Chief Inspector Lu Liankui of the General Investigation Department, detectives Shao Jingfan, Zhou Honglin, Wang Hongsheng, Deng Shu, and others conducted a thorough investigation, uncovering the secrets involved and making arrests. Cheng Zhangcai from Pudong, Zhang Yulin, Liu Zhaoji, Huang Youliang, Xu Jinling, and 13 others were arrested. Various important pieces of evidence were seized. Last Tuesday, seven people, including Lu Qinghong, were released after an investigation proved they were not involved. Cheng Zhangcai and the other five were handed over to the First Special District Court. After Chief Inspector Lu launched his own investigation, he discovered that, apart from Liu Zhaoji, who was a coppersmith, the rest were employees of the Power Company. Since the factories and businesses used a considerable amount of electricity, resulting in high monthly electricity bills, they colluded with Cheng and others to tamper with the electric meters.</p>
<p>When the electric meters were installed by the Power Company, two lead seals were used to secure the screws on the meter casing. If these lead seals were broken, it would be easy to dismantle the meter. Therefore, these two lead seals served as a lock for the electric meter. Once the meter was dismantled, the numbers could be removed and adjusted at will, either forward or backward. While lead pellets were easy to make, lead seals were difficult to replicate. One side of the lead seal had the words "Western Power Company" in English, and the other side had the number "15". Once tampered with, it would break and could not be restored. Fortunately, one of the accomplices, Zhou Dikang, who had not yet been apprehended, had studied engineering in Japan and returned to China. He was able to replicate the lead seals perfectly.</p>
<p>Thus, he produced a type of lead seal that was indistinguishable from the real one. Cheng and others then began to commit their crimes. Because the amount of electricity used varied, and the Power Company's meter reading dates were unpredictable, they colluded with one or two employees within the Power Company who were specifically responsible for this task. These employees would report the situation in advance, making their method of committing the crime very meticulous and difficult to detect. Various factories and businesses had their meters tampered with.</p>
<p>For example, if a factory's monthly electricity usage was 400 units, Cheng and others could change the reading to 200 units. The factory would then pay 200 units less in electricity bills and give Cheng and others a small reward. Both parties benefited. This type of behavior had been going on for a long time without being discovered due to the high skill of the meter tampering. It was not easy to uncover the crime, but now it has been exposed. It has been discovered that Cheng and others had tampered with the meters of countless factories. Among them, there was sufficient evidence to prosecute the following (more than 20 companies): (1) Tianwei Textile Factory at 15 Lane 296 Rue Tenant de la Tour; (2) Guohua Silk Factory at 417 Rue Tenant de la Tour; (3) Oriental Silk Factory at 50-54 Yulin Road; (4) Hengfeng Silk Factory at 65 Yulin Road; (5) Qingxing Silk Factory on Yulin Road; (6) Youfeng Silk Factory at 42 Yulin Road; (7) Weiwen Silk Factory on Yangzhou Road; (8) Shenyi Silk Factory at 109 Huasheng Road; (9) Yuandong Silk Factory at 44 Tao Peng Road; (10) Jinya Silk Factory at 46 Tao Peng Road; (11) Huada Silk Factory at 578 Connaught Road; (12) Hengda Department Store at 432 Route Boppe; (13) Shuxin Silk Factory on Weihaiwei Road; (14) China Store at 244 Nanking Road; (15) Dahua Department Store at 430 Nanking Road; (16) Zhenchang Dyeing Factory at 271 Fuzhou Road; (17) Xinwei Silk Factory at 998 Route Cardinal Mercier; (18) Yuandong Silk Factory at 232 Tangshan Road; (19) Yongtai Electroplating Company at 159 Beihai Road; (20) Taixing Company on Rehe Road; (21) Meifeng Silk Factory at 152 Tongzhou Road; (22) Jiuchun Silk Factory at 85 Hart Road; (23) Hefengrongji Silk Factory at 272 Rue Hellé; (24) Meicheng Silk Factory at 1145 Dong Youheng Road. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Feng Shide of the First Special District Court (Criminal Division One) opened the court for questioning. Lawyer Ru Baoyi represented the police station and stated the above situation. The defendants were defended by lawyers Fan Gang, Lin Yingqing, Shen Xingxia, and Lu Qi. The police station reiterated the previous situation and stated that they were prosecuting the defendants under Article 338, Section 7 of the Criminal Law for habitual theft, Article 340, Section 2 for stealing electricity, and Article 234 for forgery of seals. Western detective Hunter testified about the circumstances under which the defendants were arrested and the forged seals and documents were seized. Representatives from the Power Company, foreigners Mayer and Kfu, explained the structure of the electric meter and the methods of cheating. When questioned, the defendants generally confessed. After the judge repeatedly interrogated the witnesses and defendants, he announced that the case would be adjourned for further hearing.</p>
<p>Due to a case of embezzlement, an appeal was filed against the first instance judgment of the Shanghai District Court on December 27, 1932. This court, upon review, renders the following judgment:</p>
<p>(Main Text) The original judgment regarding Li Guojie is revoked. Li Guojie is sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment for intending to illegally possess public property for a third party, with deprivation of civil rights for five years. The number of days of pre-trial detention shall be credited against the term of imprisonment at a rate of two days for one day. The remaining charges are dismissed.</p>
<p>(Facts) Li Guojie was originally the chairman of the board of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. In March 1932, he was appointed as the general manager of the company by the Ministry of Communications. Due to the company's poor business performance, he sought to reorganize it. He planned to repay old debts, redeem mortgaged assets, add ships, build docks, and expand business. He contacted the American China Business Corporation to negotiate construction loan and dock loan agreements, totaling Shanghai taels 10 million. In addition, he entered into a contract to purchase ships on credit. These were all approved by Chen Fumu, the Vice Minister of Communications and Supervisor of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. On September 5th and 6th of the same year, Li Guojie and the Business Corporation withheld the above loan agreements. Fearing that the loan would fail, Li Guojie, on the 23rd of the same month, unilaterally withdrew 700,000 taels of the loan from the Business Corporation and handed it over to Huang Jusu, the representative sent by Chen Fumu. The money was not recorded in the accounting books, with the intention of making it up gradually when the business improved. At the same time, Chen Fumu returned the loan agreement. Li Guojie transferred it to the Business Corporation. Later, after Chen Fumu left office, the Ministry of Communications discovered the situation in November of the same year and ordered the Shanghai Municipal Government to hand over Li Guojie to the prosecutor of the Shanghai District Court for investigation and prosecution.</p>
<p>(Reasoning) The crime of breach of trust under Article 366 of the Criminal Code requires the intention to obtain illegal benefits for oneself or a third party, or the intention to cause illegal harm to the principal. In this case, the loan agreements signed by the appellant with the American China Business Corporation on September 5th and 6th, 1932, in the name of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, stipulated that the building loan portion would use the land owned by the company along the Fuzhou Road waterfront and Sichuan Road in Shanghai as collateral, borrowing Shanghai taels 10 million, and the dock loan portion would use the Shanghai Zhongbei, Huanan, and Xinwu docks owned by the company as collateral, borrowing Shanghai taels 10 million, both at 85% of face value, with a commission of 2%, an annual interest rate of 9%, and a term of 20 years. During the term or before the secured loan was repaid, if the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company wished to sell all or part of the mortgaged property, the Business Corporation had the preemptive right to purchase the mortgaged property or part of it. If it could not fulfill the agreement as scheduled, the Business Corporation had the right to sell the mortgaged property without the consent of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Regardless of any disputes, impartial persons had to be hired to determine them according to current American law. The memorandum of understanding for the purchase of ships on credit also stipulated that 30 ships would be purchased by the Dalae Shipping Company on behalf of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for use in the company's operations on the Yangtze River and in the northern and southern oceans. Before the price of the ships was paid in full, all the ships would be registered in the United States and fly the American flag. The national government would be exempt from any legal restrictions on foreign merchant ships operating along the Yangtze River and coastal areas of China. These terms were indeed excessive. If they were fully implemented, the assets and navigation rights of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company would be damaged. However, the investigation of the agreement and the testimony of the manager of the Business Corporation, Lu Deli, revealed that the 85% discount was related to the issuance of bonds, and the 2.5% commission was solely received by the lender, which was in line with the financial ministry's response and the usual practice of borrowing foreign debt approved by the court. The appellant did not have the intention to obtain illegal benefits for himself or a third party. His intention, as stated in his report to the Vice Minister of Communications and Supervisor of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, was to repay old debts, redeem mortgaged assets, add ships, build docks, and expand business. There was no evidence to show that his intention was to cause illegal harm to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Therefore, his signing of the agreements, regardless of whether they violated his duties, did not meet the essential elements of the aforementioned crime. The damage to others mentioned in that provision refers to specific facts. Although the agreements signed by the appellant with the China Business Corporation were harsh, if the reorganization could be implemented and the loan repaid on time, the damage would not occur. It could be said that there was a risk of damage, but not that damage was caused. Therefore, the original trial's determination that the appellant signed the agreements to harm the assets and navigation rights of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and convicted him of the crime of attempted commission under Article 266, Paragraph 1 and Article 140 of the Criminal Code was incorrect. The appellant's claim that the original judgment was improper is not without merit. As for the 700,000 taels paid by the appellant to the China Business Corporation on September 23, 1932, and handed over to Huang Jusu, the representative of Chen Fumu, the Vice Minister of Communications and Supervisor of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, not only did the appellant confess clearly, but the original prosecutor and this court also investigated the Business Corporation and found ten checks from the Maccalee Bank, Nos. 5115 to 5124, and one check from the HSBC, No. 6815414, each worth taels 10,000, and two checks, Nos. 681522 and 681523, and one check from the Citibank, No. D4859, each worth foreign 71,736.01 yuan, equivalent to taels 50,000 at a rate of 0.0697, all under the names of Chen Shaode, Chen Zeqing, Wei Junhong, Wei Zhenhong, Huang Weiru, Huang Zhongde, Huang Zhengde, Huang Zhide, Feng Ruiyi, Feng Shuyan, and deposited in the Zhongfu, Jin Cheng, Shanghai, and China banks, and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, which were subsequently withdrawn one after another, leaving only a small balance. The deposit dates were September 24th, 26th, 27th, and 29th, coinciding with the date of payment. The addresses of the depositors, such as 5 Zhaofeng Village, according to the gatekeeper Zhang, used to be the Huang Mansion, and 28 Meiliyuan, Daxi Road, according to Qu Shu and Yao Dekui, who lived in the alleyway, Chen Fumu had lived there before and moved away in November 1932. Furthermore, the appellant stated that he had heard that Chen Fumu's wife was a Wei, and Huang Jusu's wife was a Feng, so the depositors Chen Shaode, Chen Zeqing, Wei Junhong, Wei Zhenhong, Huang Weiru, Huang Zhongde, Huang Zhengde, Huang Zhide, Feng Ruiyi, Feng Shuyan were pseudonyms of Chen Fumu and his wife Huang Jusu. It can be inferred that the appellant's statement that he handed over 700,000 taels to Huang Jusu, the representative of Chen Fumu, is credible. Although the appellant stated that he handed over the money to the supervisor for safekeeping, and the supervisor said that the agreement stipulated that the money would only be paid when the bonds were issued, and that if the Business Corporation did not issue the bonds, they would be affected, and the supervisor was very worried and asked to negotiate with him to pay this amount first as a guarantee of credit, so it was called an advance payment. Supervisor Chen Fumu was the head of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and the manager was under him. He had to keep the money, and the general manager had no power to say no. However, in his report to the Ministry of Communications on November 15, 1932, the appellant stated that the money was demanded by Chen Fumu and handed over to Chen Fumu, and that he swore to God that he had not taken a single cent. During the prosecutor's investigation, the appellant stated that the building loan was signed on September 5th, and the dock contract and the purchase of ships on credit were signed on September 6th. Around September 3rd, the supervisor approved the signing. After the signing, he officially submitted a request to the supervisor's office to affix the official seal, but the supervisor withheld the contract and refused to release it. At the same time, he asked someone to express the need to raise some money, but he refused to say what it was for. When the creditors urged him to sign the contract because they did not know about this situation, he had no choice but to ask the company to advance a batch of money. The foreign manager understood the situation in China very well and advanced the money. When asked when the contract was handed down, he replied that he handed over the money and the contract was handed over at the same time. When asked if the check was registered, he replied that it was not registered, and he demanded that it not be registered. When asked if he had any proof of handing over the money, he replied that he had no proof. When asked why he gave it to him without proof, he replied that it was not appropriate to ask for proof at that time. When asked if he was not afraid of breaking the law by giving Chen Fumu 700,000 taels, he replied that he was really afraid of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company closing down, so he did it. Because the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company had ships and docks, there was a chance for revival. His giving Chen Fumu 700,000 taels was also an intention to achieve great things by sacrificing small expenses. When asked how he would make up for this batch of money in the future, he replied that he would gradually make up for it after the business improved. He described the situation in which Chen Fumu demanded the money and he paid it in detail. Chen Fumu did not give the appellant any receipt, and the appellant did not use any official documents to explain the money, nor did he record it in any books. Therefore, it was clear that the money was not handed over to Chen Fumu for safekeeping. Although the appellant argued that the original report was not a voluntary statement, and his confession during the investigation was not his original intention, and that the receipt of the money could not be recorded in the ordinary accounting books of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company according to the contract, and that the general manager could not resist the supervisor's right to hand over the money without a receipt, he did not provide any concrete evidence to support his defense. Therefore, the appellant's claim that he handed over a bribe at the request of supervisor Chen Fumu is undoubtedly true. However, the appellant paid 700,000 taels to the Business Corporation as an advance payment for the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, handed it over to Chen Fumu without recording it in any books, and promised to make it up gradually when the business improved. This clearly shows an intention to illegally possess public property for a third party, which constitutes the crime of embezzlement of public property under Article 357, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code. This crime is connected to the crime of giving bribes. According to Article 74 of the Criminal Code, the more serious crime should be punished. However, the original trial failed to consider this embezzlement, which was a mistake. Article 129, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Code, which prescribes a breach of duty, refers to failing to do what one should do. Chen Fumu, as the supervisor of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, was within his authority to stipulate and abolish contracts in accordance with Article 5, Paragraph 2 of the regulations of the supervisor's office of the company. The appellant, in giving Chen Fumu 700,000 taels when he requested bribes at the time of affixing the seal to the loan agreement, only gave a bribe to a public official for an act within the scope of his duties, which constituted the crime of Article 128, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code. The original trial incorrectly convicted him of the crime of Article 129, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Code. Furthermore, Article 129 (Paragraph 4 provides for confiscation or recovery only for crimes under Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the same article. The original trial found the appellant guilty of a crime under Paragraph 3 and ordered the confiscation of the 700,000 taels or the recovery if it was lost, which was not only without legal basis but also violated the provisions of the second half of Article 12 of the Criminal Code, and its legal interpretation was also wrong. Furthermore, Article 30, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code, "the person with the right to claim" refers to a crime that is prosecuted only upon complaint. Bribery is not a crime that is prosecuted only upon complaint. The Minister of Communications is not the victim or the complainant. The appellant's report of handing over the money to Chen Fumu did not intend to have the case adjudicated by the competent public official and did not meet the conditions for surrendering under that article. The original trial incorrectly applied that article to reduce the sentence by one-half, which was also inappropriate. The appellant's argument denying the crime, but attempting to exonerate himself, is not justified. However, the original judgment was improper in this respect and should be revoked and revised. Based on the above considerations, in accordance with Article 315, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Article 357, Paragraph 1, Article 120, Paragraph 2, Article 74, Article 362, Article 57, Paragraph 5, Article 56, Article 64 of the Criminal Code, and Articles 379 and 316 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the judgment is as stated in the main text. This case was executed by the prosecutor of this court, Zan Fen. The appellate court in this case is the Supreme Court. If the parties do not agree with this judgment, they should file an appeal to this court within ten days from the day after the delivery of the judgment, stating the reasons for the disagreement in writing.

<p>Robot Traffic Light</p>
<p>Satisfactory Performance in Trials</p>
<p>Incorporates Various Principles</p>
<p>The "China Press" reports that a model of a robot traffic controller has arrived in Shanghai. It was demonstrated to the police authorities of both concessions, and its performance was deemed highly satisfactory. It is said that the managers and merchants are now planning to take it to Japan for demonstrations. The robot incorporates all the principles used in the 17-route traffic system of Trafalgar Square and is built to the same size as the famous London robot. The electromagnetic principles used in its electrical design are the same as those used in automatic telephones. When in use, it is first necessary to study the traffic conditions at the intersection, dividing the day into several time periods and counting the number of vehicles traveling in each direction per minute during each period. Then, the proportion of time for east-west traffic and north-south traffic is determined. This ratio is then set on the robot's timer table. The robot can then accurately switch the red and green lights during that period. In addition, rubber mechanisms are installed at each intersection. If there is no north-south traffic during the north-south traffic time, but there is east-west traffic, the vehicle passing over this rubber mechanism will cause the robot to temporarily switch the direction of the traffic lights for four seconds so that the vehicle can proceed immediately without having to wait for the scheduled traffic time. This combination of timed operation and adaptation to actual traffic is a new invention of the robot and has never been seen before.</p>
<p>Summary of the Jiangxi Nanchang Labor Relief Project of the Jisheng Society</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Jisheng Society's labor relief project for repairing the Guangfeng Dike in the western district of Nanchang County, Jiangxi Province, publicly appointed Mr. Li Yunmen as the director, along with relief workers Gu Yabin, Sun Xixian, and others. On February 10th of this year, they took the relief funds and traveled by boat to Jiangxi, as reported in a previous issue. According to Mr. Li Yunmen's report upon his return to Shanghai, construction began on February 26th. A section of the Guangfeng Dike was repaired, approximately 12-13 feet high, with a base width ranging from 30-40 feet and a surface width of 10 feet, totaling over 32,600 cubic feet of work. Three culverts were also built. A wooden bridge was built in Yushe Town, 96 feet long, 12 feet wide, and 28 feet high. All projects have been completed. However, due to excessive rainfall this year, the water level was too low to start construction on the large water gate. It has not yet been completed and cannot be proceeded with until the water recedes. The dike and bridge project used more than 23,000 yuan in relief funds, including 6,500 yuan donated by the China and Foreign Relief Association and 1,500 yuan donated by the Moral Society. If the gate project is completed, there will still be a shortage of 2,300 yuan. No sooner was the construction of the dam and bridge completed than the Han and Yangtze Rivers flooded, and the provinces of Hangzhou and Hubei suffered major disasters. Jiangxi Province, being downstream of the Yangtze River, is also in imminent danger. It is hoped that the weather will clear up soon so that the situation can be turned from danger to safety. Recently, Mr. Huang Wenzhi, a gentry from Jiangxi Province, came to the association to report that thanks to the early completion of the project, there would have been cause for great concern due to the heavy rains. The unfinished relief work still needs to be continued. The old relief work has not been completed, and new relief work is needed. Now that there has been continuous flooding, the rural life in China depends entirely on the dikes, so that the people can be safe. Patriotic people and charitable people are requested to pay attention to this matter.</p>

<p>Eighteen Kidnappers Handed Over to the Second Special District Court</p>
<p>Wang Delin, the young son (nine years old) of Wang Fusun, a famous architect from Ningbo, residing at 2 Dafeng Lane, Huanlong Road in the French Concession, was suddenly kidnapped by kidnappers at 5:00 AM on December 28th of last year. They demanded a ransom of 400,000 yuan. Negotiations failed, and it was not until April of this year that the police of the Public Concession uncovered the location where he was being held, rescued the hostage, and returned him to his family. The kidnappers, Wang Yuanwei, Zhang Xiaomao, Yao Sheng, Qian Ziming, Cai Xilin, Chen Guoqian, Wu Yesong, Qian Changmei, Chen Abing, Madam He Ma, Madam Shi Yu, Madam Chen Qiu, Madam Shen Ma, Madam Chen Zhang, Madam Zhang Wang, Wu Xiangfeng, Shen Qian, Chen Zhang, and 18 men and women, mostly from Shaoxing, were arrested.

Wang Yuanwei was sentenced to life imprisonment, Zhang Xiaomao to ten and a half years, and Yao Sheng to nine and a half years. The remaining people were sentenced according to the severity of their crimes. Those who were not involved were declared innocent.

Yesterday, they were handed over to the Criminal Division 1 of the Second Special District Court. Judge Cai Changnian conducted the preliminary hearing. Lawyer Gu Shouxi of the police station stated the details of the case, stating that the 18 defendants were transferred from the First Special District Court of the Public Concession. The defendants confessed that they were involved in the kidnapping case of Wang Delin, the son of Wang Fusun, at 2 Dafeng Lane, Huanlong Road, on December 28th of last year. The police station had not yet completed the investigation. Due to the large number of people, the investigation would take time. He requested a postponement of three weeks for a detailed investigation.

The court reviewed the report and questioned the defendants one by one. The hearing was postponed to 9:00 AM on July 13th. Those who were found to be not suspicious during the period would be sent for trial in advance to facilitate their release. The 18 defendants were detained.</p>

(1) (Question) Since the Central Government has stopped holding the Provisional National Congress, and the Southwest region still does not understand, what is the reason? (Answer) It is undeniable that there is a gap between the Southwest and the Central Government. However, it cannot be said that the Southwest region as a whole does not understand the Central Government. There are some comrades who have a slight gap [with us].

<p>(Nanjing) Representatives from Sichuan stationed in Beijing said that since this spring, the communist bandit Xu Xiangqian's forces have rampaged through Sichuan after fleeing from Shaanxi. Fortunately, Tian Songyao has made every effort to suppress them, and the occupied counties have been successively recovered. However, the war between Liu [Xiang] and Deng [Xihou] has reignited, and the bandit forces are even more rampant. Currently, the Red bandits in Sichuan have a tendency to flee outwards again. If they are not suppressed with all efforts, the entire province of Sichuan is at risk of becoming a bandit area. Tian Songyao's resignation as the Director of Bandit Suppression is not to shirk responsibility, but because the friendly forces only know how to engage in internal strife and are unwilling to suppress the bandits. Now, after receiving the report, the Central Government has, in addition to sternly ordering Deng [Xihou] and Liu [Xiang] to cease fire immediately, also ordered Liu Xiang, Yang Sen, and Liu Cunhou to send troops to suppress [the bandits].

<p>△ The First District Changed to a Lecture Meeting Due to Insufficient Numbers</p>
<p>△ Wang Diyan and Four Others Elected as Secretaries in the Second District</p>
<p>△ Tang Liqing and Four Others Elected as Secretaries in the Third District</p>

It is learned that the education associations in the first, second, and third districts held general meetings of members yesterday afternoon.

Details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e81">First District <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The First District Education Association held its third general meeting of members at Jingye Middle School at 1:00 p.m. yesterday. Cao Peizi, representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Zheng Hongnian, representative of the Municipal Education Association, and members Yang Jingyi, Shi Renzheng, Zhang Lichun, Chen Rongfa, and others, totaling 262 people, were present. The presidium consisted of Tao Guangchuan, Zhao Luqing, and Zhang Yongchun. The recorder was Jiang Luolin. First, Chairman Tao Guangchuan reported that there are a total of more than 700 members in the district, but the number of attendees today is insufficient to meet the legal requirements, so it will be changed to a lecture meeting. Next, Wang Yunwu gave a lecture, stating that teachers bear the responsibility of educating young people and have a great impact on society, especially primary and secondary school teachers who educate children, which has an even greater impact. Rousseau said that educating children should allow for the development of their personality. This statement may be appropriate in countries that are already on track, but it is not suitable for the morbid state of China. Chinese teachers are like doctors, and they should find the shortcomings of the national character and use education to correct them. The biggest common disease of the Chinese people is the lack of communication, such as between mouth and heart, hand and chest, spirit and matter, and individual and society. Communication is lacking everywhere, especially among educated people. Therefore, those who run education in our country must not allow children to develop their personality at random, but must use the methods of doctors to treat this disease. There are many ways to treat the disease, but none are as effective as primary and secondary school teachers who guide them everywhere in practical education. Finally, Zheng Hongnian gave a speech, the content of which is omitted. The meeting then adjourned.</p>

<h3 id="e84">Municipal Education Bureau Handles the Pudong Student Strike <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>▲ If Principal Wu is Unable to Take Responsibility in Fact ▲ An Order for the Board of Directors to Appoint a New Principal</p>
<p>(Shanghai News Agency) A minor dispute occurred at the Private Pudong Middle School in this city due to student dissatisfaction with the measures of Principal Wu and one or two faculty members. After receiving the report, the Municipal Education Bureau immediately sent personnel to investigate. At the same time, fearing that bad elements would take the opportunity to stir up trouble, it notified the Municipal Public Security Bureau to instruct the Pudong Public Security Third District Branch to send police to pay attention at any time to prevent accidents. In order to prevent the expansion of the dispute, in addition to ordering the school's board of directors to quickly decide on a proper solution, it also persuaded the students to attend classes with peace of mind and wait for a thorough investigation. Since then, the students have continued to attend classes, and all have fully participated in the secondary school graduation joint exam. However, it is reported that the principal has not been to school recently, resulting in no one responsible for the school and the school administration almost completely suspended. The Education Bureau learned that at this time, when the semester is about to end, it is deeply concerned that this will affect student learning and the school's facilities for the next year. It has urged the school's board of directors to convene a meeting as soon as possible to discuss a solution. If it is deemed that Principal Wu is in fact unable to take responsibility, a new principal should be selected to take over as soon as possible to rectify the situation. If the board of directors cannot convene or the meeting is adjourned, the chairman of the board of directors is responsible for submitting a reorganization plan to the Education Bureau for approval to facilitate rectification. It is expected that this matter will be completely resolved soon.</p>
<h3 id="e85">A Record of the Third Day of the College Guidance Movement Week <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>▲Yesterday was Middle School Day: Today is Women's School Day</p>
<p>Yesterday was the Middle School Day of the College Guidance Movement Week organized by the Vocational Education Society of China's Vocational Guidance Institute. Despite continuous rain, the weather suddenly cleared up in the morning, and the number of visitors and attendees increased several times. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Lecture Situation</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM, Mr. Yang Weiyu and Mr. Pan Yangyao presided over the opening ceremony and gave introductory speeches. They were followed by Mr. Tao Baichuan, Mr. Ni Wenya, and Mr. Li Zongwen who gave successive speeches. In the afternoon, Mr. Zheng Xigu and Mr. Chen Binhe gave speeches. (The lecture notes recorded by the Bingxun Speed ​​Writing Agency, by Mr. Liu Dihua.)</p>
<p>▲Attendees</p>
<p>Yesterday's attendees and visitors included Cai Wuji, Zhang Wei, Xu Wancheng, Huang Jingwan, and students from Wuben, Shanghai Women's Supplementary School, Tonghui, Bide, Tang Tao, Hua Long, Guoben, Henan Vocational School, as well as students from various municipal primary and secondary schools, totaling six to seven hundred people in the morning and afternoon.</p>
<p>▲Popularity of the College Guidance</p>
<p>The "College Guidance" book compiled and printed by the institute to guide young people in their higher education has been praised by attendees in recent days as an excellent book that is both affordable and of high quality. Many people have bought and read it, with almost everyone having a copy in hand.</p>
<p>▲Increased Exhibits</p>
<p>In addition to the books sent by Commercial Press, Zhonghua Book Company, World Book Company, Datong Book Company, Shanghai College, Sanlin Vocational School, Huahua Middle School, and Shanghai Women's Supplementary School, the number of books displayed at the association have increased. In recent days, there have also been textbooks and reference books from Qinfen Bookstore, Life Bookstore, Beixin Bookstore, and Women's Bookstore, various maps from the Shanghai Geographical Society, as well as charts from Peking Yanjing University, Xiamen University, Shanghai Women's University, and a variety of school regulations from other schools. The maps of various university departments, university locations, distribution maps, and comparison tables of tuition fees drawn by the institute were especially noticed by young people seeking higher education.</p>
<p>▲Bright Light Company Gifts Fans</p>
<p>The Bright Light Thermos Company donated specially made exquisite paper fans to be distributed on the spot, citing the large number of attendees in recent days and the hot weather.</p>
<p>▲Mr. Tao's Speech, entitled "Opportunities for Poor Students to Study," stated briefly that the average income for a man trying to find a job in Shanghai is less than 50 yuan. If a family has five members, the monthly expenditure is at least 70 or 80 yuan. Under such circumstances, it is not easy to send children to study. Therefore, (1) poor children have very few opportunities to receive education at this time. (2) If we can barely afford to go to school, we should also consider whether our mothers can afford it. Now, let me introduce you to an economical and reliable school, which is Jingye Middle School. The total cost per semester is only 60 yuan. Poor students with excellent grades can also get free tuition. As for purchasing books, we can combine several students to pool funds for joint reading, which is much more economical, etc.</p>
<p>▲Mr. Ni's Speech, entitled "How to Receive Secondary Education," stated briefly: (1) Before entering middle school, you must recognize what secondary education is and pay attention to: 1. What is your personal intelligence like? 2. Pay attention to the family's financial situation. 3. What is the current trend? (2) What to do after entering middle school: 1. Pay attention to physical and mental cultivation. 2. All subjects must be developed evenly. 3. Do not give up the opportunity to study, such as listening to lectures by famous people or talking with teachers, etc.</p>
<p>▲Mr. Li's speech briefly stated: (1) Choose your personal interests. (2) Determine your aspirations for studying. (3) Assess your abilities. (4) Study schools of the same nature that you want to enter: 1. Observe and investigate the history of the school. 2. Whether the equipment is perfect. 3. Whether the fees are within your financial ability. 4. What are the career prospects of each graduating class and whether they can gain social trust. 5. Whether the school's faculty and staff are responsible, enthusiastic about education, and seek happiness for students. 6. Whether the school's atmosphere and reputation are good. (5) Only by entering a good school can you get good results, etc.</p>
<p>▲Mr. Zheng's speech briefly stated that in the current situation in China, it is a declining and unorganized spirit of independent countries. Education is not in line with the needs of society. The talents that emerge are of no help to the country. Therefore, when talking about young people receiving secondary education, it is necessary to say three points: (1) Cultivate a strong physique and a spirit of enduring hardship. (2) Break the concept of scholar-officials and practice manual and mental labor to support oneself. (3) Pay special attention to applied science to cultivate and increase production capacity, etc.</p>
<p>▲Mr. Chen's speech briefly stated that among the more than 200,000 middle school students in China, they account for 1/1700th of the country's population, that is, only one middle school student out of more than 1,700 people has the opportunity to be a middle school student. Although this is so good, you must pay attention to: (1) Under the severe situation of internal and external troubles in China, each middle school student bears the responsibility of more than 1,700 people to save the endangered nation. (2) Have the hard work and endurance to see the people of Russia, you can know that they are able to work hard and endure to achieve the success of the three-year plan. (3) Take a skeptical attitude, if there are lessons that you don't understand, you must thoroughly understand them clearly, and never repeat what others say. This is the law of middle school students, etc.</p>
<p>▲Tomorrow is Women's School Day</p>
<p>Today is Women's School Day, which is also the last chance. At 9:00 AM, Ms. Yang Qianzhen, Principal of the Chinese and Western Girls' School, Mr. Lu Guiliang, and Ms. Shen Shijing, Director of Academic Affairs of Weiji Primary School, will give speeches. At 4:00 PM, Ms. Wang Xiaoying, Principal of Wuben Girls' School, and Ms. Huang Shaolan, Principal of Bowen Girls' School, will give speeches. Students from various schools can go to listen, etc.</p>

<p>Lin and Qiu Achieve Victory</p>
<p>Lin Baohua Wins 2-0 Against Baolin Dan</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai Wins 2-1 Against Jia Weiya</p>
<p>│Singles Matches Continue This Afternoon from 3:00 PM│</p>
<p>The Philippine tennis champions Jia Weiya and Baolin Dan competed against China's Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai at the China Tennis Court yesterday. There were five to six hundred spectators. As a result, Lin and Qiu both achieved victory. The skills of the Philippine players were not particularly high. Lin's victory over Baolin Dan was not difficult. Bao's tennis skills are still below China's Zheng Zhaojia. However, this is Jia Weiya's doubles assistant, not a singles player. As for the battle between Jia Weiya and Qiu, the first set was very intense. Jia used various hitting methods with ease. Qiu was defeated by him with a score of 3-6. However, in the following two sets, Qiu won easily with scores of 6-2 and 6-2. It was found that Jia Weiya's tennis skills, various hitting methods, have been extremely skilled and soft, and his posture is beautiful. His ball saves are very stable. His backhand shots are fast and stable, and his forehand shots are high and soft. Moreover, due to insufficient length and lack of experience, this was the reason for his failure. Today, there will still be singles matches this afternoon. Lin will face Jia Weiya, and Qiu will face Baolin Dan. The battle process is as follows:</p>

Afterwards, Baolin Dan mostly self-destructed, had no control over the ball, and lost four games in a row. Lin won with a score of six to three.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the second set, a tense situation was seen. After Lin took the first game, he lost two games in a row.

He responded with ease in the left, right, far, and near, and made very few mistakes. Everyone was worried about Qiu Feihai.</p>
<p>In the second set, Jia Weiya had a tendency to vent his energy in one breath and then weaken. After one set, he even drank water and changed clothes, and he was already tired. Qiu Feihai was calm as usual, and unhurriedly, he used long-range and short-range hits to make Jia Weiya exhausted. In addition, Jia occasionally made careless mistakes, so Qiu retaliated with a score of six to two in this set without much effort. Jia Weiya changed his shirt again in the third set. After a short rest, he competed in the third set. Qiu took the lead with a score of two to one. In the next game, Jia Weiya won three points in a row, thinking that he could steadily get two equal scores, but unexpectedly, he failed again and again, and failed again. Qiu then won with a score of three to one, and his momentum became more and more fierce. Jia Weiya tried to cheer up, but he felt powerless. The ball took a defensive stance and rarely attacked, which was a bad strategy. As a result of this set, Qiu won again with a score of six to two. Referee Zhou Jiaqi.</p>

<p>▲Result: 16 to 5</p>
<p>The McKinley baseball team is dominating Shanghai and is invincible. Yesterday, they competed with the St. Thomas University of the Philippines team at the China Baseball Field. Both sides performed extremely well, and St. Thomas' baseball skills are very sophisticated, the layout is tight, and the hitting is excellent. Each time they scored a home run, they scored as many as seven points in the fifth and eighth innings. Although McKinley was strong, they conceded defeat. As a result, St. Thomas won with a score of 16 to 5. The scores are as follows:</p>
<p>St. Thomas 1 0 0 0 7 1 0 7 0 1 16</p>
<p>Innings (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9)</p>
<p>McKinley 0 1 0 1 0 2 1 0 0 1 5</p>
<p>Also, in St. Thomas's competition in Japan, most of the opposing teams were middle school students, and the results were half wins and half losses. From this, it can be seen that the baseball technology in Japan is excellent.</p>

<p>The complete curriculum was revised after months of careful discussion and is now more perfect. The most noteworthy points are: 1. All required courses are divided into common required courses and major required courses. Required courses outside the major can be taken in other departments, but these courses must be related to the major. 2. Emphasis is placed on the cultivation of national, English, and technical skills. There are national and English courses from the first to the fourth grade. However, students in the second and third grades must also study another foreign language in addition to national and English languages. This is designed to facilitate studying abroad and researching advanced knowledge. 3. The curriculum of the College of Liberal Arts is based on literature and expresses the spirit of literature, but seeks to adapt to the practical application of literature, that is, based on writing, first seek to refine the grammar of the country and foreign countries, and be able to communicate fluently in both translating from national to foreign languages and from foreign to national languages. 4. The natural science curriculum of the College of Science is the latest of modern times, so that it can keep up with the ever-changing inventions of the world and not fall behind. 5. The curriculum adopted by the College of Commerce is suitable for current practical application on the one hand, and is also suitable for the application of various organizational changes in the future, that is, the "body" and "use" are clearly distinguished. 6. The curriculum of the Teacher Training Department, in addition to several courses such as teaching methods, also offers several courses such as Nanyang Geography, Nanyang Biology, Nanyang Laws and Regulations, Nanyang Commerce, and Customs. In addition to their own credits, they can choose several courses, that is, they are interested in researching a certain subject and can choose courses at any college. As for the students of each college who also want to enter the Teacher Training Department, they can choose fewer original courses. In the future, after graduation, in addition to the diplomas of the original colleges, they can also be given certificates of the Teacher Training Department. This is to cultivate educational cadres in our school in order to fulfill the mission of speaking through the culture of Central and South. In addition, due to the limitation of space, the content of the curriculum will be omitted.</p>

<h3 id="e102">How to Protect Your Radio During the Rainy Season <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— He Dazhi</p>
<p>(1) Reasons why radios are easily damaged during the rainy season</p>
<p>All electrical appliances are most susceptible to dampness. And the radio's sensitivity is very acute, so the impact of dampness on the radio is significant, so the radio is most vulnerable during the rainy season. When the radio is wet, because water is a conductor, the current can escape through moisture (this phenomenon is called leakage). Or the wire is broken due to corrosion caused by moisture, resulting in a variety of problems.</p>
<p>(2) Radio's own failures</p>
<p>When the radio is working, if you touch the coil with your hand, the sensitivity of the radio will immediately decrease. If the regenerative force is not fully enhanced, it will be completely silent. The same result is obtained by touching the grid leak or grid capacitor or the grid wire of the high-frequency amplifier tube. That is, when the coil or grid wire is damp, it also reduces the sensitivity, weakens the regenerative force, and deteriorates the selectivity.</p>
<p>Secondly, after the low-frequency transformer is dampened, the volume is reduced, and the winding is easily broken. This type of failure is the second most common cause of radio damage. (Vacuum tube failure is the most common cause of radio damage.) After the power transformer is dampened, the insulation of each part becomes poor, which reduces the volume and generates extremely large AC noise (Hum).</p>
<p>Therefore, the location of the radio must be in a place with good air circulation, dryness, and little dust (after the dust adheres, the dust easily absorbs moisture). During the rainy season, on sunny days, the radio must be moved to the window for ventilation and wipe off the dust.</p>
<p>When purchasing a radio, you must choose a fully enclosed case with components and wiring hidden inside the case, so that the chance of dust and moisture intrusion is less harmful.</p>
<p>(3) Loudspeaker failure</p>
<p>This type of failure is the same as that of a low-frequency transformer, and the internal winding is easily broken. In addition, the poor wiring causes the current flowing into the loudspeaker coil to leak, which reduces the volume. When this type of failure occurs, the wires can be replaced with new ones.</p>
<p>Figure 1 Poorly insulated wire</p>
<p>Symbol representation</p>
<p>Radio current</p>
<p>Leakage current</p>
<p>(4) Antenna failure When insulators and supports are damp, more radio waves leak to the ground (as shown in Figure 2), which causes the sensitivity to become dull, the regenerative force to be weak, and the selectivity to be poor. However, the insulators cannot be wiped clean one by one, so it is better to use two insulators connected together.</p>
<p>Figure 2</p>
<p>Dotted line shown</p>
<p>Is due to insulation</p>
<p>Poor body and</p>
<p>Leakage current</p>
<p>Indoor lead-in wires are mostly covered wires, so they should not be nailed to walls that are easily damp, but to wooden pillars or wooden beams.</p>
<p>(5) Battery When the protruding surface or sides of the battery poles are damp, the current leaks and the battery consumption increases. (As shown in Figure 3) If the battery placed in the radio case has this phenomenon and comes into contact with other circuits, it can even make the radio silent.</p>
<p>Therefore, the battery should be placed in a dry and well-ventilated place like the radio, and it should be wiped with a cloth from time to time to remove dust. If A and B batteries are storage batteries, special attention should be paid to them.</p>
<p>(6) Precautions during thunderstorms</p>
<p>There are often thunderstorms during the rainy season, which increases the noise of the radio and even disrupts the reception. At this time, of course, the antenna switch must be turned down to connect it to the ground wire. For AC radios, the power plug must also be unplugged.</p>
<p>It is currently the rainy season, and anyone with a radio should take extra care to protect it to avoid unexpected losses. (The end) (Translated and excerpted from "Wireless Telephone")</p>

<p>— Cheng Quan</p>
<p>(1) The entire radio should be placed in a dry place to prevent mold from entering and damaging the radio. (2) Place several packages of quicklime inside the radio to absorb moisture. (3) Install lightning protection equipment in the antenna circuit. Or connect the sky and ground lines during thunderstorms to avoid accidents. (4) If the AC radio is used for too long. The fuselage heats up. Then rest for a few minutes before turning it on again. Or in the primary power supply inlet line. Directly connect a light bulb. (Watts are equal to the radio. The bulb is dimly red). Then even if it is used for a long time. It will not heat up.</p>
<p>(5) When the A, B, and C batteries of the DC radio are not in use. Be sure to remove the lead wires from the machine to avoid leakage from the wooden box. (6) For long and short wave radios that use plug-in coils. The coil must be placed in the driest place. Otherwise it is very easy to fail. (7) The radio distance is not far. The volume and sound quality deteriorate. This is affected by the climate. Do not dismantle and repair it rashly.</p>

<p>— Jing</p>
<p>The use of electricity and the progress of the world are always directly proportional. The more advanced the world is, the wider the use of electricity becomes. Therefore, in recent years, the use of electricity has been increasing day by day. Dry batteries are one example. For example, flashlights, small radios, and other machines that require less electricity use them. Since the prevalence of radios, the sales of dry batteries have flourished accordingly. Although alternating current can be used to replace dry batteries, it always feels a bit troublesome from a procedural and economic point of view, not to mention that today's one or two tube machines all use dry batteries? But there is one thing that is very regrettable, that is, the power of dry batteries is limited. Once they are used up, they are useless. You can only buy new ones. Isn't this very uneconomical? Now there is a way to make the used dry batteries repeat their electricity. Now I will write this method below and introduce it to readers, hoping that they will use it more and try to save money as much as possible. Take saltpeter (Ammoniachloride) and dissolve it in a bowl (it doesn't have to be a bowl, just something made of glass or clay) of warm water to make a saturated solution (that is, pour saltpeter into the water, stir with a stick, wait until it is completely dissolved in the water, or completely disappeared, then add saltpeter again, stir again, until it can no longer be dissolved in the water). Then take the used dry battery whose shell is not damaged, and open a few small holes in its shell, and then put it in this solution. After putting it in for a few hours, take it out and it will have electricity. This method has been tried by me several times. Although the resurrected dry battery does not last as long as the new one when used (at least it has ten hours of electricity), it is much cheaper than buying a new one. Finally, I want to state that when placing it in the solution, you must not let the carbon rod in the middle touch the solution, otherwise it will not take effect. Note: Such resurrection is possible three times, but the power is reduced each time.</p>

<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>The plug-in coil of the shortwave radio is easy to loosen because it needs to be replaced frequently. To avoid this drawback, you only need to heat the wire next to the stove when winding it. After the wire is heated, it will expand by itself. Then, while it is hot, quickly wrap it on the rubber tube. After cooling, the wire shrinks. This coil is tightly wrapped around the rubber tube and is very firm and will not loosen for a long time. Wire hemp rope</p>
<p>Sometimes the coil needs to be wound with spacing (SpacingWinding), that is, each turn must be separated by an equal distance. This type of coil is quite difficult to wind. The easiest method is to wrap another hemp rope together with the wire. The thickness of the hemp rope depends on the distance required. After the winding is completed, remove the hemp rope and the wire will be very neat. (As shown in the picture)</p>

<p>— Huang Jiancun</p>
<p>▲..........</p>
<p>(1) Overview</p>
<p>Since transmitters differ in the method of generating oscillating current, they are divided into four types: spark type, arc type, generator type, and vacuum tube type. The advantages and disadvantages of these types will be described below. The spark type uses spark discharge to generate free oscillation in the oscillation circuit, and then transmits it to the antenna and emits it into space. This method was very popular in the wireless telegraph industry in the past, but because the radio waves it emits are so-called damped waves, containing a wide range of wavelengths, which interfere with other communications, the Third International Wireless Telegraph Conference held in Washington in 1927 stipulated that it should be prohibited from use from 1930. It can be asserted that this method will disappear by 1940. Before the invention of the vacuum tube, some people also tried to use the instantaneous quenching spark type with less damping rate for wireless telephone experiments, but because it has the disadvantages of noise caused by sparks and unclear sound, it has not been put into practical use. Although the arc type also belongs to the method of transmitting equal amplitude radio waves, the occurrence of electric arcs is prone to unstable states, and because it cannot transmit pure equal amplitude radio waves, the noise is more than other equal amplitude radio wave types, which also interferes with other communications, so it is still prohibited by international radio treaties, suffering the same fate as the spark type. This method has many noises, poor clarity, and is not suitable for short wavelengths, so it cannot be converted to wireless telephones. The generator type can transmit pure equal amplitude radio waves and is still popular in the long-wave radio telegraph industry. Since it can transmit pure equal amplitude radio waves, it is theoretically possible to use it for wireless telephones, but it is not easy to make it generate short waves like the current broadcast wave in terms of structure, and it also has the disadvantage of being difficult to adjust, so this method is still not applicable. The vacuum tube type can be said to be the darling of the current radio industry, and is very suitable for both wireless telegraph and wireless telephone. Wireless telephone only has today's prosperity due to the appearance of vacuum tubes. This is known to everyone. The reason why this method can occupy a dominant position is its characteristics: (1) It can transmit pure equal amplitude radio waves, (2) Wavelength and power can be used arbitrarily. (2) Clarity is excellent, etc. (To be continued)</p>
<p>(Domestic and Foreign News)</p>
<p>▲ Achievements of Fada Brand Radios Fada brand radios are the most famous radios in the United States and are exclusively managed by the British-American Da Yanghang in China. The machine parts are strong. During the yellow plum season, ordinary radios often have problems such as unclear reception and a lot of noise, while Fada brand radios have no such problems, and are still loud and clear as before. Because the circuit structure of this machine is different from ordinary ones, the quality is quite good, and the welding is firm, there is absolutely no bursting or crackling sound. It is a good product in the radio industry, and it is said that it has been very popular among the people since its release.</p>
<p>▲ Durability of Mingzhu Brand Dry Batteries Mingzhu brand single-cell dry batteries produced by Hezhong Electric Company at No. 168 Sichuan Road in this city are durable and have always been praised by all walks of life. Now, in order to meet the needs of the society, the company has launched two new types of Mingzhu brand wireless A-group dry batteries and B-group dry batteries based on its experience. They are well-made and have sufficient power, which is better than imported products, and the price is only half of that, which is really good news for the radio industry.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Disaster <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— Baihe</p>
<p>It's really terrible. I don't know if China is destined to suffer disasters, or if "disaster" is particularly fond of China, which makes "great philanthropists" hold donation books all year round, looking for people to "help as they wish", and "great entertainers" tirelessly performing "to raise funds for relief." In short, China's "disaster star is flourishing" and "disaster luck is prosperous", which is undeniable.</p>
<p>"Airplanes dropping bombs" and "besieging cities and seizing territory" have created "disaster victims." A faction rises, and a B faction falls, "refreshing the officialdom," creating "disaster officials." The national power is declining, and diplomacy is humiliated, creating "disaster overseas Chinese." These are somewhat different from "dragons and floods breaking out", "locusts passing through the territory", and "not seeing a drop of rain for three years." I have no way to name them, so I name them "man-made disasters."</p>
<p>According to the news in the newspapers these days, the flood in Wuhan this year is inevitable to be "magnificent and grand." This is naturally a "natural disaster", and no one can blame anyone for "natural disasters", but they have to bite the bullet and appreciate the "taste of disaster."</p>
<p>In fact, Wuhan is only hit by floods every two years. When the water recedes, it will recover. There is no need to be alarmed. In Shaanxi and Gansu, it is so dry that crops cannot be planted. "Trading children for food" and "wild dogs eating people" are not uncommon. An eighteen-year-old girl doesn't even have pants to wear. That is considered a "particularly severe disaster."</p>
<p>These "disasters" are indeed scary, but they are still limited to one place. At most, they are like the "sixteen provinces hit by disaster" in the previous year. Now, except for the four northeastern provinces, there are still several provinces that have not been "hit by disaster." Only the "intellectual famine" that is prevalent throughout the country is qualified to "lead the group of disasters" and is considered the "leader in disaster."</p>
<p>China's disasters are more than just "three disasters and six difficulties." When Tang Seng went to the Western Paradise to seek scriptures, he did not encounter ninety-nine and eighty-one disasters, and they were still forcibly pieced together. If we calculate China's "natural disasters" and "man-made disasters", it may be more than this number. Tang Seng encountered eighty-one disasters, and he "completed his merits and became a righteous fruit." China has experienced so many "disasters", but it is still "a boundless sea of ​​suffering, and there is no shore to turn back." China, a country with many disasters and difficulties, still has not seen the disaster star recede, and the disasters are heavy, so some people say that the best way to relieve disasters is to summon high monks everywhere, start the Vajra Dharma Assembly, or recite scriptures and worship Buddha, in order to "invite heavenly blessings" and "eliminate disasters and bring blessings", so as to achieve "good weather and national prosperity and people's peace."</p>

<p>The cigarette paper shop on the ground floor of a single-family shop was like a smoke screen bomb, filling the entire space of the cigarette paper shop. Except for bursts of scorched air rushing straight into my nostrils, it was like falling into a five-mile thick fog, and I simply couldn't see myself clearly. If it hadn't been for the several Shandong fellows from the pancake shop next door waking me up, I would have unknowingly been buried in the fire pit, my soul would have vanished with the smoke, and my body would have been destroyed with the fire, without the pain of illness or the fear of death. How decisive! I was thinking like this. "Dangerous... not us..." From the thick smoke came one or two sentences with a hint of joy and a tone of claiming credit in the authentic Shandong accent. I knew that the fire had been extinguished by the Shandong fellows. "Amitabha, turning danger into safety"; the smoke has gradually thinned, and the Shandong fellows have gone to the pancake shop. Two girls, around ten years old, in the cigarette paper shop were standing there like wooden chickens. Their grandmother was taking a breath and slowly tidying up the ashes of the broken quilt. It is said that the fire was caused by this broken quilt falling on the mosquito incense. The little owner of the cigarette paper shop was sleeping upstairs with his new wife. From the time the fire started downstairs, to the fire was put out, he never came downstairs. He was a little panicked, letting his elderly mother and a pair of girls left by his ex-wife deal with this matter. The Bushidoists of the Fusang island country are no different from the god of fire. When this god of fire descends to the northwest corner, most of the indoor owners are still intoxicated in singing and dancing; on the night of January 28, the god of fire visited our inner room, but the owner was still in bed warming his sweet dream. Although there were a few people who put out the fire, and then someone burned incense and worshiped, they finally sent the god of fire away; not long ago. The embers in the northeast corner were rekindled, and spread to our north window, but, cutting off the fire │ no, only temporarily putting out the fire │, was also the dragon clock old lady borrowing the strength of the servant, didn't the little owner still sleep in bed talking about fire insurance? The Chinese are always so leisurely, what's wrong with the little owner of the small cigarette paper shop?</p>
<h3 id="e110">Ode to Candles <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Huo Xueming</p>
<p>This was my feeling one evening: the electric lights suddenly went out, and the streets at night were all plunged into darkness. My study could not distinguish all the objects. At this time, the eyes were almost the same as wax figures; they had no visual power, just like being trapped in a deep dark coal mine, where the safety light was suddenly blown out. You slipped out a spike of faint yellow red candlelight from the door seam of your neighborhood. Although it was a spike, it was brighter and more lovely than all the lights. A thing, when needed, is often unnoticed and thought to be useless; but it exerts extraordinary functions. So I quietly groped for the matches, struck a light, and searched for white candles on the dusty bookshelf. After spending five or six matches in a row, I found a white candle that had been gnawed by wild rats. Just this one burning and glued to the tea tray, the peach-shaped flame gave birth to awnings, spitting out light, illuminating the whole room. I felt that turning on the electric lights in the dimness of the day was far inferior to burning candles in the darkness of the night! The victory of the candle lies in its smallness in chewing fire!</p>
<p>If it is the Lunar New Year's Eve in the depth of winter, and snow is flying outside the window, in a mountain village; burning a red candle, leaning against the window to watch the plum blossoms and branches in the snow gradually getting fatter, due to the radiation of the candlelight, how beautiful is that scene! Moreover, there is a female poet standing next to her shoulder, both dizzy in the faint candlelight, silently looking at each other, followed by a smile, but very quiet; what kind of scene is that!</p>
<p>If you have talked about the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, you may think of a section in the twenty-fifth episode, saying that "Guan Gong surrendered to Cao Cao Cao wanted to disrupt the etiquette of his ministers, and made Guan Gong and his two sisters-in-law live in the same room. Guan Gong held a candle and stood outside the door, from night to dawn, without any fatigue." After understanding it, you will feel that a heroic general is vividly drawn in front of you, pressing his sword and cracking his eyes, staring angrily at the candlelight with that kind of awe-inspiring attitude!</p>
<p>At the moment when the candlelight flickered, I associated with the above two different realms. But I also noticed that the candletears were gradually falling, the candle heart was gradually shortening, and the remaining amount was also getting</p>
<p>less; I felt that burning like this would soon be extinguished, and I looked at my own shadow, and I was heartbroken. I wrote an old poem: "Looking at the curtain wave, the eye pattern, but pity the lonely shadow accompanied by dusk, wandering cloud temples are destroyed first, seeking light and the heart burns! :::" Really, those young people with poppy heads only understand fashionable ladies like flowers, only pursue abstract names, and Guangming makes a long and winding red dream. As a result, he only puts his own body, along with tears, in his own mystery-like aura, gradually shortens, gradually disappears, and gradually turns into green smoke. "Shedding tears for others until dawn"? However, after the dark night, it will always be dawn!</p>

<p>Who am I, wandering in the wind and dust? The remaining powder and rouge are all heartbreaking. Why do you need three million taels of gold? Just exchange your youth with your heart and blood. People suspect you are a teenager because of your demeanor. Stars have already dyed the temples with silk. Make a warm dream at the end of the world again. Perhaps it is a floating life that has not yet ended.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Depression <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Qibai</p>
<p>Grand ambitions frustrated by hundreds of encounters. Duckweed roots and willow catkins take effort to arrange. Deep affection wants to tell the vast feeling. Bitter wine is poured in vain to relieve depression. It is better to escape Zen, life is a temporary residence. Finally need to insert lotus in death and bury it. The taste of great sorrow is thoroughly tasted. When will the sweet return to the sugarcane realm?</p>
