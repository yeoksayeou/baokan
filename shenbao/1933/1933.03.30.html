<p>歷史上一切之演變誠無能逃於經濟條件之支配而民族鬥爭之轍跡其因經濟條件之變化而易其方式更如影之隨形無能或爽十八世紀以前之民族鬥爭爲封建制度下之鬥爭封建制度下之生産以土地爲其主要元素故其民族鬥爭之方式亦以土地問題爲其中心强盛民族對於弱小民族之侵略其動機往往由於人口之增殖及因此而起之生産不足其行動往往不外略地攻城奴蓄豪取自産業革命以還機械發明日新月異舉封建時代所有生産不足之義下之民族鬥爭亦逐漸轉變其方式而成爲消費市場之爭奪舉凡資本主義列强間之衝突以及列强對於弱小民族之侵略其目的均在獲得一生産落後之民族以吸收其過剩之産品歐洲大戰之後固亦曾有若干領土上之變化然其命意所在仍不外殖民地之分割與口岸之轉移雖亦扶立小邦保持軍事上之優勢而中心問題仍不外確立其經濟上之覇權整理其藉剩餘産品以剝削弱小民族之陣線而已</p>
<p>日本帝國主義對華之侵略自亦不能例外此次侵華之動機旣由於經濟之恐慌而經濟之恐慌即由於生産之過剩爲欲求解决生産過剩而侵略則其主要之目的在壟斷東三省之消費市塲蓋甚顯矣然資本主義内在的矛盾旣自然的日趨銳化則其因此種矛盾而起之一切行動其將必然的自陷於矛盾或亦爲無可逃避之因果九一八事變以還日本帝國主義對華貿易之衰退已爲不可掩之事實此由於國人排日運動者半而由於兵火變亂之餘購買力自然衰退者亦半東三省之對日貿易日人雖自誇進步但以吾人之所知則東北進口之日貨若干爲日商存貨之增加更有若干爲日人在滿鐵建設及軍事設備之材料實際上屬於人民之消費者殆亦有减無增若謂鐵蹄槍彈之威力可以提高中國人民之購買力則寗有是理以故一年半來日日帝國主義對華之侵略徒破壞中國之消費市塲使日本帝國主義及列强間生産過剩之狀態繼長增高整個資本主義之矛盾愈趨尖銳日本帝國主義之所求於對華侵略者適得其反而已</p>
<p>日人於此必以侵略未告厥成以自慰則敢問侵略即告厥成又將如何滿蒙者日人所視爲資源者也設日人而果得志於東三省也則其最高之希望自爲依照田中奏摺之所陳開發滿蒙之産業使果如此則日本帝國主義内在的矛盾必又將突飛猛進而至於不可救藥蓋當前之經濟恐慌旣爲高度的生産過剩則滿蒙資源開發之結果增高生産過剩之狀態豈不又多一偉大之原動力經濟恐慌之路線豈不更將淪入深淵以終古日人爾時將復以何種威力以消納此空前過剩之産品哉關於此點吾人雅不欲以主觀的成見作自欺欺人之快語而良以按諸事實日本資産階級已深懼滿蒙開發之後日本本部大部分之産業將因不足競爭而歸於劣敗由是之故倘使日本帝國主義開發滿蒙之結果而使滿蒙物産足以供滿蒙及中國本部之所需則於歐美列强固爲一重大之矛盾而與日本本部之矛盾更將無由調解也</p>
<p>日本帝國主義對華之侵略不問其爲成功抑爲失敗均徒增其内在的矛盾而無以解救其當前之恐慌旣如上文所述於是希冀妥洽者流或將以此而衒其隠忍屈辱之得計則吾人於此有必須加以申說者日本帝國主義之對華侵略旣發生於整個資本主義内在的矛盾而侵略之結果復足使中國社會之矛盾瞬趨尖銳時代的環境適促中國反帝民族革命客觀條件之完成故妥洽之說徒以延長日本帝國主義最後掙扎之時間置自身於革命對象之列而妥洽終無以實現利害所關終無以自拔於環境此又國人所不可不知者也</p>

<p>（日内瓦）　國聨會爲注視中日爭端而組織之顧問委員會、頃已閱悉日本退出國聨會之通告、及秘書長德魯蒙之復文、顧問委員會對於日本通告内所陳之日本意見、尙未决定發表新宣言以批評之、惟該會對於由不承認「滿洲國」而引起之各種問題、擬悰速予以研究、此外該會各國代表對於禁止軍火運往交戰國一層、亦將徵求各該國政府意見云、按由不承認「滿洲國」而引起之各種問題、爲「滿洲國」要求加入國際郵電公會·及各國駐滿洲領事·對於地方官吏所處之地位等、（二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　國聨顧問委員會今晚五時半開會、至七時一刻止、休會時、未曾决定下次會議之日期、但在耶穌復活節以前、未必再開會也、顧問會討論因日本退出國聨而起之一般事態、但决定毋須置覆、愛爾蘭代表勒斯特首先提出日本脫會之問題、謂渠知此事與顧問會僅有間接關係、惟渠覺顧問會不妨採取一種立場、而答覆日本脫會之通告書、覆文應指陳日本雖退出國聨、然仍爲盟約第十條所拘束、再覆文對於日本致秘書處文中所稱日本有權自行解釋關於日本與他國關係之國際條約一層、應駁斥之云、會衆對於此點、稍有討論、但卒决定日本來文中各節旣已由秘書處覆之、故顧問會無答覆之必要、顧問會旋聽取國聨副秘書意人畢洛蒂所擬關於不承認「滿洲國」問題之報告書、該報告書所言者、爲對於「滿洲國」加入郵電同盟之請求、應有何種行動、及對於「滿洲國」郵票錢幣護照等物、應如何待遇之、此報告書尙未完備、將提交專辦不承認「滿洲國」事之小組委員會、此委員會將於耶穌復活節後召集開會、顧問會繼乃討論軍火禁運之問題、以期準備禁運委員組之議程、但一般意見以爲某大國對於此事之態度、尙無把握、故目前此事無可進行、衆覺宜稍等候、以視與南美兩國爭議有關的軍火禁運提議之結果、捷克代表吉塞斯基（駐瑞士捷克公使）發表甚顯明之言論、詢及美國對於此事之態度、但美代表威爾遜列席旁聽、始終緘默、旣不參加討論、亦未表示其政府之意見、故軍火禁運委員組集會日期未定、但大約須俟諸耶穌復活節後也、今日出席會議者連美國在内、僅二十一國、土代表未到、英代表爲外部秘書楷爾、法國以瑪錫格里爲代表、德代表爲凱納、（二十八日路透電）</p>

<p>中日關稅協定期滿廢止</p>
<p>統一幣制整理各種稅收</p>
<p>行政院副院長宋子文、於前晚乘夜快車離京、昨晨八時許返滬、各報社記者往謁宋氏於私邸、據氏發表談話、汪精衛回任行政院長問題、今晨中政會决定後、即可正式復職、茲分誌宋氏談話如後、</p>
<h3 id="c111">汪即復職 <a href="#c111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>宋氏表示、汪氏回任行政院院長、已絶對無問題、將俟今晨中央政治會議議决後、即可實行復職、負此後政治之全全人則專辦財政、故余目下所可與諸君談述者、亦限於財政方面之事項、余雖仍兼任行政院副院長、伹副院長並無發表與行政院有關之談話之權也、</p>
<h3 id="c112">蔣來滬訉 <a href="#c112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>記者旋詢軍事委員會委員長蔣介石氏行將來滬消息、是否確實、宋氏未有肯切答詞、僅謂渠在報端上見有此項記載、但亦並未否認、聞蔣俟參加本日中政會後、一二日内將來滬、</p>
<h3 id="c113">統一輔幣 <a href="#c113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>宋氏又稱、各商業團體、請求統一輔幣、此事當可辦到、我國除銅銀兩種輔幣外、現尙無鎳幣、鎳幣之仿造較難、多數之國家、於緊急時期、常利用此項鎳幣、改造軍火、如槍彈頭等等、原料供給爲難也、至實行金本位、亦爲困難、因實行金本位之國家、以金購銀、較爲便宜、非金本位之國家、以銀購金、則極感困難、世界經濟會議是否五月開會、現尙未决定故本人赴歐出席否、亦尙不可預定、</p>
<h3 id="c114">關稅恊定 <a href="#c114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>中日關稅協定、至五月十六日以後、即告期滿失效、無所謂續訂與否、因該項協定、只規定某種貨物其入口稅之維持一年及三年耳、初因我國與各國訂立關稅自主之協定、日本自亦不能例外、故維持其最低期限之稅率、故有此項規定、</p>
<h3 id="c115">整理稅收 <a href="#c115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>關於整理稅收一項、華北方面、旣歸中央、華南方面、亦無問題、宋解釋稅收之統一、非完全由中央派人所辦理稅收、始謂之統一、蓋凡能依照中央之方法辦理、亦即充一之謂也、故中央對整理稅收一層、務求其成爲簡單化、至整理鹽稅、此時亦較以前爲佳、</p>

<p>丨本埠朱嬰君來信丨</p>
<p>讀十三日王慕冲君來函，他說他的夫人「不識字，不明人情世故，不知世界大勢，」總括一句話，就是說他的夫人没有知識。在這裏我要問的：什麽呌做知識？讀了萬卷書，得了博士學位，而自己是音不勞而食，這是否呌做知識反過來說：雖然不識字，没得博士學士，而天天做的都是有益於人羣的事業，至少他自己就不做社會的寄生蟲，這是否呌做眞的知識，明白了這點，我來論王君的夫人。王君的夫人顯然是一般人所謂舊式女子，然舊式女子，能燒飯，能洗衣，能帮助家庭一切工作，又能撫養小孩，使丈夫專心做他應做的事業，這是滞於社會有益？自然我不是說女子只該做這些事，然無論如何，比之以搽臙抹粉爲事，電影塲裏進跳舞塲裏出的那些摩敦女郎，總算要强萬倍吧。雖然也有些有眞學問的女子，然在目前的中國，「英雄無用武之地，」知識只做了她們的裝飾品，而事實上仍不過是社會的寄生蟲罷了。倒不如像王君的夫人，雖然没甚知識，（如王君的看法）然能一點一　的爲社會做些實際工作。再：王君說：「原來我家不十分好，而她家有錢。」又說：「她的性情很温和，對我很謙恭，遜讓，不驕傲，……「從這樣看來，王君的夫人，的是一個本質很好的女子，雖然她是有錢人家出身，而她却有挜錢人的意識，如果好好訓練，不難做一個改革社會的先鋒隊，事實上這類女子已經不少呢。王君現在或是一個大學生，大學生有改革社會的責任，要知我們做改革事業，一定先要犧牲自己，同時要把社會的弱者都拯拔出來，即末，王君認爲自己的婚姻縱不滿意，也得根據這個磃不則而去實行，換句話說：就是自己的女人没甚知識也可忍受，而同時把没知識的设　　地敎她有知識，這才是正當道理。不然：你怎樣會吹牛皮，說：「我將來要爲社會做事，我是社會的優秀分子，」還不是欺人之談！</p>

<p>丨本埠瞿問壽君來信丨</p>
<p>編者先生：我每天讀到「讀者顧問」裏以科學性的，唯物論的立塲，解答讀者目前的一般疑問時，我都很誠懇，很勇敢地領略和接受着，所以，我之喜歡多讀貴欄的癮癖，比之閱讀整個申報裏的新聞欄論及文藝欄言…都覺要緊而着重！因子這樣，我在貴報辦的新聞函授學校招考國文試題裏，「對於本報的批評與建議一的試題裏，我特别地贊美着本欄，和批評着本欄丨但至今未得回聲。現在，我提出了上面標題裏二個緊要而嚴重的問題，請在貴報披露吧！其第一個問題的經過是這樣：我由親朋的介紹，進這商店裏當個售貨兼賬席的工銀勞働者：到現在爲時不過八個多月，但其間的等級很嚴，尤其這「最毒婦人心」的當本店監察委員式的所謂老闆娘，店裏瑣屑的問題都由她涉獵和監視的老闆娘，每天老闆對待夥計的酷臉，在受過這種環境的都曉得，當然是比之法官對待囚犯有過之無不及的，而這小　和老闆娘…亦然不出例外。所謂「夫妻老婆店的我們××店我是天天在他們集團奚落之下過活與工作，因之彼此的惡感，層疊地建築的似乎與金字塔相彷彿的高，自流泉一樣的深了！爲了這種原故，現在我們集合着幾個本店同事，一面準備脫離這樊　，一面便集合股本在本埠自創新店丨這與原來一樣的職業，在買賣上，多少要被將脫離的老闆所嫉妒。目前我們丨同事者丨準備向這老闆作總的辭職，所以這老闆謂我主動，這結果，是否涉及法律問題？其第二問題，便是由第一問題産生下來　問題丨借欵丨在本埠我有個富翁的宗兄，他有幾十幢市房，現在我爲之收租。他那裏，過去爲了我們幾個同胞，向之借貸没有償還之故，他對於我之信用丨借欵丨亦視爲一邱之貉，商借便亦難得照准。那末，現在我在替他收租，每月終要經手一千餘元的現欵，我想在面借不允許時，便在這所收欵項裏頭，自動挪用洋三百元丨作爲目前開店資本丨然後，再行告訴他，以爲强行借貸的策劃，這時於雙方感情上，當爲破裂，但對於法律問題上，又將怎樣？</p>
<p>答：足下前在本報新聞函授學校招考試文裏「特别地贊美着本欄和批評着本欄，」我們聽到這種贊美，實在是慚悚之至，因爲同人等知識修養都有限，每懼無以答讀者諸君期許之殷：聽到這種批評，確是誠懇地接受：讀者大衆對我們的批評的眞切到如何程度，同時也就是表示我們的涓滴之勞獲得讀者大衆的注意到如何程度，而且我們不但要備讀者大衆的顧問，並且十二萬分希望讀者諸君多多供給我們社會生活的眞實材料。這是後話，現在且就足下所提兩問題答復如左：足下聨合店内同事另組新店，若果手續清楚，脫離得法，或許不會涉及法律問題，但是這不是說，你們的老闆不加破壞，破壞當然不能免，然而只要你們團體堅固，到不妨事。不過我覺得你們這種事情，有點自相矛盾。你們自己因爲老郶及女老闆的虐待而覺悟以利害的衝突，但是你要曉得利害衝突的關係是整個的社會組織與整個的經濟制度形成的，要想解决這種問題，須從整個的社會着想，從偉大的羣衆組織着手，才有辦法。若是大家脫離了老　的勢力而自己來做老闆，在這老式的社會裏面，假使你們自己做了老闆，有什麽方法不去刻薄人呢？你們有什麽理想的計劃没有呢？敢問。這是第一個問題。你們向人借欵則可，若「自動挪用，」「强行借貸」，輕則足以影響雙方的感情，重則可以發生法律問題，甚或連你們新發生的營業都要遭受致命的打擊。據我們看來，你們這事有些不對，若果你們一相情願地幹下去，一定要失敗，愼重愼重丨這是第二個問題。</p>

<p>— 天然</p>
<p>最近有兩件很好的消息，一件是上海農民教育館館長張鳳山先生等所發起的土布商店，一件是太倉金來聞先生等所發起的土布改良會都來和我商量推廣，吾十分高興，不妨來介紹一下：（一）未有土布商店以前，張君等先在顓橋與呂吉人君等綠肥紅瘦一個土布工廠，自紡自織，出品非常之多，非常之好，極為各方所樂用，不過僻處鄉間，採購不便，張君等便在蓬萊市廠組織了一個土布商店，店中出品，都是來自鄉間，及土布工廠所自織。其品名花式得多，可以說到様様齊備，前天開幕時候，一般婦女，很是歡迎採用，眞正十分可喜。（二）太倉人士，承兵災之後，為了提倡家庭工業改善農民生計起見，會同嘉定寶山兩縣人士，組織了一個土布改良會；貸紗放織，幾個月來，織就土布很多，所有出品，都是很堅實，很低廉，遠近各地，一致歡迎，正在託國貨公司，國貨介紹所推銷，這樣看來，像印度甘地的辦法，推行到我國，也很便利，士布救國這句話，或者不久可以實現了。金君有布衣救國一文，語重心長，可供參考：</p>
<p>衛文公以大布之衣興邦，爲歷史上之美談，甘地以紡織土布抗英，為不合作之表示，古今中外，如出一轍，大布之為用大矣哉。吾國迫於外患，救國聲浪，已囂塵上，尤以抵制仇貨提但是國貨為最熱烈最普遍。其堅忍不拔之氣槪，決非從前五分鐘熱度所可比。蓋提倡國貨，振興實業，所以挽回漏巵，而抵制仇貨，經濟絕交，可以制敵死命也。餘謂挽回漏巵，莫如提倡大布，制敵死命，莫如服用大布。蓋布之原料爲紗，今日之所謂本廠布，其細紗原料是否純粹國貨，爲一研究問題，吾國除永安紗廠申新紗廠以外，能紡細紗供給廠布之原料者，絕無僅有。統計本國布廠所用細紗原料，外國紗佔百分之八十，本國細紗如人鈡牌等不過百分之二十，考其原因，棉種改良，尚未見效，棉之纖維短而不　，不適宜於細紗之用，一也。紗廠技師僅能紡製二十支以下粗紗，若紡製細紗，必須聘請技術較高之人，人才殊不易得，二也。本國棉旣不適原料之用，延聘技師，又不容易，則成本價格，因之高貴，紡細紗之利益，遠不如粗紗之厚，三也。以是三原因，各紗廠尙少細紗錠子之設備，即或購有細紗錠子，亦皆擱置不用。吾人熱心愛國，提倡國貨，凡屬機關學校制服，無不舍外國之毛織品，而服用本廠布，然本廠布之原料百分之八十，仍不免用外國細紗，所謂抵制仇貨計劃，仍未澈底。為目前救國計，欲制敵死命，經濟絕交，各紗廠宜力求細紗錠子之設備完美，並研究細紗紡製之出品。在此本廠細紗原料供不應求之時，凡屬公務人員，學校教員學生，一律服用大布，慶賀宴會，紀念會塲，機關長官，學校教員，宜以藍布長袍，黑布馬褂，率先倡導，則布衣運動，未有不風響雲從者。昔曾國藩巡閱長江，身穿凌莊布袍，彭玉麟夏季閱兵，曾服多羅麻箭衣，至今各處布店中，尙有凌莊布多羅麻出售。蓋經在上者之一度提但是，而是項布疋，藉傳永久。而況脫粟布被，荊釵布裙，大布二字，爲吾國歷史上素著之儉德乎？城中好高髻，四方高一尺，宮中細腰，民間減食，端在先知先覺之倡導耳。或曰蠶絲原料，亦為我國之天產品，如果提倡布衣，則蠶農織戶之生計，未免受其影響，不知布衣運動，原爲一時救國計，爲制敵人死命計，不得已而以大布爲呢絨，及廠布之替代品耳。際此天災頻仍，喪亂薦至，民不聊生之時，力行節約，庸亦何傷。十年生聚，十年敎訓，沼吳以後，如果物力充裕，實業擴展，細紗足以供布廠出品之用，則服用原料，原不限於大布。　家計富有者，如果服用本國綢緞羅紗，本不在禁阻之列。蓋吾人對於自己服用，不妨提倡大布，對於固有之蠶絲事業，仍當提倡改進，盡量擴展，對外貿易，以救濟工商業之危殆，世有韙我言者乎，馨香神壇祝以求之。</p>
<h3 id="c213">國貨年琺瑯業的展望 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 周成助</p>
<p>走在萌芽時代的琺瑯業，我們從近來每年在困苦環境裡掙扎到六七百萬的營業數，再從琺瑯製品關於日常生活密切的情形看來，假若時局敉平，交通便捷，民間購買力普徧以後，料想琺瑯業的未來，是何等光明燦爛的命運啊！</p>
<p>說展望，我們必得先來回顧一下，上海一埠，樹著不少琺瑯工廠的烟囪，整天的在工作，已往的事實告訴我們，從雇用外籍技師而至自製原料，從寥寥的兩三様出品而至花式層出不窮，這在我國實業史上，的確雄佔努力猛進的一頁，尤其在去年滬變以後，業中人鑒於同業步伐散漫，於是整飭公會，厘訂章程，改進營業改賬事務的一個與眾不同的特殊組織。</p>
<p>無疑的，商場之中免不了同業競爭，琺瑯業豈能例外，但較之他業已經好上萬倍，我們放遠眼光，這種爭奇鬥勝搶先恐後的現象，總究是力求上進的好表示，但求牠不要陷入自相殘殺，同業混戰的一途就夠，這是我們在國貨年對於琺瑯業展望的第一點。</p>
<p>其次，就是同業問有了開誠合作的精神，就應該切實的來充實內部，充實的方法，不外減低成本，改良工作兩條路，因爲我們旣知道琺瑯品對於人生日用的重要，又知道有深入民間的趨勢，那末永遠的售價高貴，和供不應求，那裏可以達到目的，檢查目下的琺瑯製品，總是脫不了粗製濫造的缺點，爲了市塲上消極的需要和同業逐鹿的原故，不得不特製整批副號的出品來，挖肉補瘡地延長營業的命脈，再爲了原料人工騰貴而想不出方法去緩不濟急補的原故，售價永是放不低來，我想大伙兒此下去，沒有一個具體的策略去積極挽救，結果是很可怕的，這是我們在國貨年對於琺瑯業展望的第二點。</p>
<p>琺瑯業中人不乏識見高厚，深謀遠慮的當局。過去的歷史很足證明琺瑯業是比他業無論如何較有希望的一業，如果再接再厲地從本位上去努力。我相信國貨年是琺瑯業的轉變的時期，記得何躬行君在（上海之小工業）一書裏說（將來深入田間，行見村中沽酒者，陌土送飯人，均携琺瑯器皿時，）我同様把這段話，對琺瑯業存一個殷切的厚望！</p>

<h3 id="c214">節約運動與服用國貨 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— 潘仰葊</p>
<p>認定節約是美德，打破了只向衣冠不向人的謬誤觀念，而且有許多先覺的主婦們在努力，這不僅是一時的家庭改革運動，而且是新的善良社會風俗建樹的基礎。關於節約運動的意義和價值，我們早已明白的承認，在現時做的階段中，當然只有力行而已！</p>
<p>談到節約，便涉到經濟，對於功用相同的物件，當然以價廉物美的爲合格，甚至寗可樸素些，不必爲著奪得華而放侈。那末，我們在選用物品時，功用相同的國貨和艙來品，（注意有心傾　的外貨）從這裡便可給我們一個適從的標準。</p>
<p>據一般的觀察，都市的人比鄉村的人用的舶來品多上幾倍，尤其是所謂摩登青年男女更成了外貨的推銷所：所以鄉村裏布衣暖菜飯飽的居民，不必要提倡節約，並不放縱自己的生活，而都市中的奢侈成風，和崇拜舶來品的劣根性，未始不是在互爲因果。這是我們在力行節約運動時，應該要明白認識的事實。</p>
<p>服用國貨是各國國民同有的美德。有時且捨棄價廉物美　外貨而用自己的出産品，因爲他們對於國貨早有了認識和決心，自然能爲著整個的國民經濟而犧牲自身。這一點，在開始建樹國民對國貨信仰心之際的中國，我們當然不能即存奢望，不過中國國貨並沒有比舶來品貴的，所以節約運支和服用國貨正可同時解決。</p>
<p>因爲崇拜外貨和奢侈成風是互爲因果，更因爲節約運動和服用國貨可以同時解決，而且家庭經濟和國家經濟也有連繫的關係：在這連環性的局面下，我們自然希望能同時努力，而且沒有犧牲，沒有矛盾，正可相輔以行呵！</p>
<h3 id="c215">努力除三害 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 治成</p>
<p>萌芽期的中國國貨生產界，即被寄生了三害，癆菌般的在侵蝕，我們非拿出周將軍的精神不可！</p>
<p>第一：東是陸稿薦，西也是陸稿薦，不自努力於生産品的改進而却想借人的招牌來賣錢，結果是被影射的受損失，滑頭貨也是失敗，損人不利己，我們要首除此害。</p>
<p>第二：勇於內爭是我們貴國之特色，生產界卻也不能免。翟克恭先生曾說了一個故事，手電筒最初是國貨克服了舶來品，後來卻因爲國貨界減料減價以競爭而自己沒落，結果是舶來品仍獲漁人之利。德國生產界有自己不內爭的美德，我國貨界似乎也應該爲整個團體着想而除此第二大害。</p>
<p>第三：改頭換面固然是卑劣的舉動，生產界好用舶來品的原料，也正是間接的推銷外貨，害的葛成慧博士且有除去小孩子不是道地國貨之感，這固然是少數人的行動，但是生產界要主顧堅定國貨的信仰，自己非得以身不可，而且事關國貨信譽，所以最好（有則改之，無則加勉）的除此第三害！</p>

<h3 id="c216">介紹一個製造寬緊帶的國貨工廠 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— 絲生</p>
<p>寬緊帶，看來這樣一件小小的消　品，在四五年前完全仰給於日本貨的時候，每年漏巵，也要有數十萬元之鉅·自從美綸廠的國貨寬緊帶出世以後·因出品的精良，國人樂於服用，日貨就自然逐漸被淘汰了·</p>
<p>美綸織物廠廠址，在蘇州閭邱坊，是吳人張子庠君創辦的·起先專造絲襪，因受人造絲絲襪充塞的影響，頗有折閱·後來改製寬緊帶，恰巧社會上提倡國貨的聲浪日高，營業便蒸蒸日上，遂擴充範圍，添加資本，至今已成一規模完整的國貨工廠了·</p>
<p>美綸廠現有工人約一百三四十人，其内部組織，以經理室賬房間爲最高機關，管理廠内一切事務，其下設工務處，工塲，鐵工部，染色部：整理部，引擎間各部分：工務處專司預備工程，如搖緯，縴經，縴橡皮線，絡絲，　絲等工作，都用女工，工塲分梭織，錠織二部，梭織機又有外國式，中國式二種，織工都屬男工，并聘工程師一人，司指導監督之責·鐵工部司修理及製造機器，染色部司染色；均用男工·整理部做上槳，盤板，修改，裝匣等瑣碎工作；用女工，引擎間專司發動電力，並備有馬達，以補引驚之不足·</p>
<p>寬緊帶原料的來源，除紗線有國貨可用外，人造絲及橡皮，都是舶來品·其織機如提花機等　較爲精巧者，都向外洋定製，其簡單之普通機，從前均交中國鐵工廠製造，其工作過程，簡單說來，大約先經染色部染色丨再交工務處做各種預備工作，然後上機織造，最後交整理部整理裝匣，運出銷售·</p>
<p>美綸廠在本地雇有跑街，奔走推銷，在上海設立申莊，以爲貨品輸出，和購買原料的樞紐，營業總額，年達二十餘萬元，因工廠在内地，人工開支，均較上海爲省，成本减輕，所以頗有盈餘，其銷路遍及華南，華北及長江流域各地，遠出南洋羣島一帶，九一八以來，在華北方面，因受時局及日貨傾銷的影響，銷路驟見呆滯；而在華南及長江流域一帶，與日貨競爭，則仍繼續保持優勢，爲日貨所不敵·</p>
<p>製造寬緊帶，在我國是一種新興的工業，美綸廠創辦到現在，還不足五年，已有這樣的成績，確是難能而可貴·我們在這裏·一方面希望美綸廠精益求精，愈加發達；同時還希望别的許多國貨工廠，也要急起直追，努力爭先，那末國貨前途，庶幾有無窮光明燦爛的希望！</p>
<h3 id="c217">關於國産肥皂 <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— 潔廬</p>
<p>肥皂是日常的必需品，浣衣洗身，都要用肥皂。我國最初所用的，都是洋貨肥皂，雖然那時已經有了國貨出品，伹是製造粗劣，不堪使用，每年利權外溢，何止千萬！後來德國人又在上海徐家匯，設立了一個很大的皂廠，預備作大規模的製造，但是開辦不久，忽然歐戰發生，德國人因爲要回國參戰，皂廠由我國鉅商項松茂先生集資收買，這就是現在的五洲固本皂廠。</p>
<p>因爲器械的完備，和接辦人的努力，所以五洲固本皂廠就在我國人的經營底下一天一天的擴大起來，舶來肥皂的勢力慢慢减低，而國貨固本皂已經是供不應求了。</p>
<p>我們仔細研究固本肥皂能夠成功的原因，完全是在主辦人松茂先生肯負起責任，如像對於出品的改良，原料的化分，油質的融洽，滌垢的效力，在在都有詳細的考察和研究。尤其是關於提煉一項，固本皂含水量僅是百分之二十五，而其他劣等肥皂的含水量就要到百分之五十，所以比較起來固本肥皂永遠不會發生不良的變化。</p>
<p>無疑的，五洲固本皂能挽回利權，在國貨史上佔着很光榮的一頁。</p>

<p>— 柯定盦</p>
<p>中華民國參加芝加哥博覽會徵品展覽會，已經在上月份展覽在白利南路。因爲當前的國難，十分危急，無可奈何中，竟然明令停止，這是多麽使人感到不快！</p>
<p>中國國貨公司，在這多事之秋的國貨年中産生，原也知道没有多大的力量來幹出轟天的大事，去和充滿着十足洋氣的上海市場奮鬥。不過他的宗旨，抱得很不差，他是要宣揚中華的國光，發展國貨的出路。還要盡量地搜集各地的土産，務使成爲一個全國最完備的國貨公司。</p>
<p>這次參加芝加哥博覽會的各出品人，受到這樣的打擊，當然非常不願意；同時中國國貨公司本着他們的宗旨，雙方合作，在該公司二樓南部，舉行再展。現在會期，在昨天已滿，各出品人已籌有相當辦法，自動赴美。將來中國的出品，在芝加哥得到嘉奬，載譽歸來，是多麽值得慶幸啊！</p>
<p>出品展覽，在中國國貨公司，雖然祗有很短促的十四天，可是確有值得回憶的事。那每天的參觀者，友邦人士，却占據十分之四，從此可見中國的出品，能受友邦人士讚同的地方，是很多的。我們中國人，再不起來用國貨，我想是很覺得汗顔吧！</p>
<p>展覽的出品，多至恒河沙數。單就江西代表　貫虹說：「磁器，有二百五十餘箱」。的話來證明，其他可知道一個大槪了。</p>
<p>現在先將次序排列，來介紹我以爲珍奇的國貨，這不過是舉得：「滄海中的一粟。」或許也可說：「掛一漏萬」。呢！</p>
<p>嘉定徐行鎭振興顯記出品的，草絲織的手提夾，錢囊，提籃……織得很精細，上面還有適當的圖案呢！森林藤柳草器廠出品的桌椅，是用柳條做的，漆着淡米色，再加上咖啡色的桌面，和同色線條，在色調方面講，美麗雅緻；在式樣方面講，特異精巧，可稱新時代的傑作。湖南紙傘，在以前就很著名，珠紅漆的傘身，黄銅包的傘頂，藤絲紮的傘柄，已不合現代人的使用。他們很會迎合潮流的製出不少新奇的紙傘，婦女用的更其覺得美觀，色彩圖案，分外鮮明。就是傘柄的一綹長鬚，也都是依着傘柄和傘身的顔色配製的。小孩用的一種，巧小玲瓏，輕鬆有趣，許多小朋友們拉住他們同遊的家長們要買，因爲此種紙傘並不出售，小朋友們也就無可奈何！</p>
<p>「華茶」，在外人眼光中，向來就很重視的，因爲眼前一般牟利不顧將來的商人們，把出口的茶葉，　入雜質，給外人看穿了，這纔一落千丈，却給×國一個絶好的推銷機會·</p>
<p>著名茶商汪裕　，也有出品，其中名貴的幾種，如：「蓮峯桑蕊」「微巖苦丁」「漫頭普洱」「温州白亳」「龍團普洱」「碧螺春」……等。</p>
<p>江西復興公司出品，可稱最多。樟木箱的雕刻，是異常工細。如「荷花」「松鶴」「五駿」「二喬」「仿漢磚」……等不是平常的匠手所能的。夏布，羅紗等，也都很好的。關於瓷器，古代的，有：「宋定窰碗」，淡靑色，隠約有花紋。「唐影靑碗」初看好似白色，細看是淡淡的靑色。「南唐永和磁碗」有二種，一個碗邊不平整，好似荷花開放的樣子，顔色是深褐色，有黑色隠紋。一個是黑色，間有白色不十分清楚的紋路。「唐影靑斛角瓶·」瓶身約　尺半高，瓶口直徑約三寸。淡靑色　光極好，腰邊，有圖案，瓶頸有尖角圖案，很有意味，標價是十萬元。「大明嘉靖年製靑花碗，」褐黑色，有細照，「北齊大明年製彩花碗，」碗身白色，碗底和碗緣，有赭紅雙線邊，碗底中央圓圈内，有紅梅一株，眉月一彎，繞有異趣。</p>
<p>觀音的像，出品很多，我最愛的是：「紫竹林中」的這一座，它的底盤直徑，約八寸。面上用細工雕出後有紫竹林，前有蓮花池。觀音站在紫竹林前，手持楊枝，神態飄逸，富有仙意，童子在對岸雙手作揖，在雕刻上講，實在是已達化境了。</p>
<p>明貴的碗，還有「宋龍泉空底碗」直徑約七寸，豎直着下裝紅木架，顔色是淡綠的，底面空，如果把它倒放在桌上，很像現代的水盂，底緣是深褐色，這個碗，標價是一千四百元。</p>
<p>飛禽走獸，都做得很生動。最引人注意的，是一隻一隻的白鵝，它的大屁股矮矮地差不多碰到地面了，它的頸子伸長，正在呌着呢丨它的羽毛，也和眞</p>
<h3 id="c219">推行新出國貨的一個建議 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 靄吳</p>
<p>一般惟利是圖的商界敗類，利用大家熱烈提倡國貨的機會，偷偷的把仇貨改換國貨商標，在市上混售，而因以爲利。熱心購用的人們，一再受欺，於是對於眞正國貨，如顔色好看，身骨匀凈的，便有些懷疑，不敢購買，國貨行銷，横遭打擊。因此我有個提議：凡是一件新出國貨，經售的商店，應該把製造工廠，調查得明明白白，設廠地點，經理何人，資本多少，做個簡明告白，放在店裏。同時對於經售該項國貨的店員，也要作一度的指導，使他們對於該項國貨製造情形，胸中雪亮，顧客詢問時，能夠源源本本的說出來。這個辦法，很可以帮助推行國貨，實在不是小端末節。</p>
<p>編者按靄吳先生這個建議，極有價值，希望國貨公司和一般經售國貨的　　商店，采納此意，以利購者，而免魚目混珠之憾。</p>
<p>的一樣地做出，標價有兩種，是「三元」和「十元。」其中有一隻是比較小的，據出品人的愛護神情看來，是非賣品吧！</p>
<p>磁器大缸，也有不少，有一個：「御窰金紅團龍千件缸，標價一千元，覺得很是可愛，還有一個變窰的瓶，出品人說：「就是燒幾千個瓶，也難得這麽一個。」這句話眞不錯。瓶身高約九寸，周圍約一尺多，瓶地白色，頸作褐色，瓶身暈着「褐」和「紅」的化色，層次很明的一朶一朶的雲頭，簡直是千古難見的精品。</p>
<p>其他畫片磁板，人像，掛屏，茶具水果，文房用品，以及大花瓶……等，不下幾千件，眞是目不暇給，何無文的出品，以精小勝人，有「白色雕瓷花籃」籃的底盤，直徑約五寸，裏面放着不少花，朶朶昻首朝天，其中的牡丹，最能顯現它昔日花王的雄姿。還有「康熙吉翠廟頂」，是圓形的，高約七寸，周圍約一尺二寸，顔色天藍，鮮麗得很。</p>
<p>揚州吳榮盛出品的漆器，很有超人之處，最名貴的，是：「嵌八寳周柱人物屏風」，是道光初年所作，極有古意。雕嵌的功夫，實在不小，標價是一萬元，出品人標着：「希世之珍」四個字，是狠適合該項作品的，文房用品，種類狠多，小圓檯，扇式凳，以及成套方盤等，都用螺甸嵌出圖案，再加雕刻，是值得把玩的。</p>
<p>福建的漆器·是素負盛名·惠兒院的出品，這一次得了不少的佳評。雕像有：「孔子」「老子」墨子」「三星」「孫中山」「關帝」丨丨有坐，立二尊，我的意思，立的比坐的來得神氣。丨丨「壽星」「達摩」「鐵拐」「螺祖」「戚繼光」丨丨看見戚將軍的雄姿凛凛。使我想到現在的情形，不禁下涙啊啊丨丨丨彌陀…等，各有各的獨具姿勢，都能表示各個的精神，在此，可以知道想作者的不苟了丨還有幾件佳作，就是：「牧童與牛」，牛的毫髮畢具，一絲不亂。牧童的活潑狀態，在這幾件中，都各别的，也正難得。</p>
<p>宜興陶器，在有清一代的陳鴻壽曼生手裏，曾經有不少經過他雙手揑作的傑搆，現在的代價，却很貴呢丨這一次宜興職業學校窰業科，有不少新出品。如「茶壺，茶杯，茶盤，」「花瓶」「花揷」「拼碗」……，每樣有幾十種，所繪的圖案，是最新進的。有一具「孫中山像」，做得維妙維肖。</p>
<p>吳縣周少甫的小擺設，很能表示中國特有的風度。這次參加的，有鴛鴦廳一事，裏面陳設的桌，擱几·椅·櫈·茶具，爛臺，　設……以及書畫，屏，聨·琴·棋·絲竹……等，都是特製的，所費恐怕不是數千金不辦吧！</p>
<p>古玩部的陳列法，是别出心裁，陳列的几架，都是用紅木特製的。其中引人不忍遽離的是：「紅木座的大小水晶球」，「翡翠雕刻的大山」丨丨山脈，樹本·人物·朗朗如畫，色作深絲，的是神品。「觀自在像」也是用翡翠雕成的，衣摺，容貌，很有古意，如果顔色再能綠些，更是可貴了。「周朝的爵鼎」。一漢朝的銅洗」，以及「古銅的盤龍瓶」丨丨一龍昻首，欲入雲霄之狀·很覺有勁。丨丨雕刻行船」，是把一節毛竹來雕成的船中坐着壽星，右手捧着蟠桃，笑容可掬。後梢侍童坐着，很是悠閒。船長約八寸，雕工極佳。</p>
<p>其他有美亞織綢廠的絲織品·三友，三星，鴻新，中國内衣公司……等的棉織品，以及中華的標本……等，都足使人歎爲觀止的。</p>
<p>我最後得聲明一句，因爲看得怱忙，未能盡量的介紹，在前面已經說過舉得：「滄海中的一粟」「掛一漏萬的話，所以現在也不再詞費了。</p>
<p>編餘</p>
<p>唐僧取經　老友池宗墨君：嘗謂辦國貨事業，其艱險有如唐僧西天求經。蓋當海運未通，中印阻絶，崑崙喜馬，兩重障壁，峻極於天，流沙千里，層冰滿山，唐僧俱大信心，發大願力，一衣一鉢，萬里奔馳，卒達佛國。亦恃有三頭六臂之孫悟空，大耳長嘴之猪八戒，與膂力絶人之沙和尙等爲之徒，前後夾輔，左右扶持，纔底於成。故辦工廠者，應師法唐僧之毅力。並求多能而忠實之孫悟空，猪八戒，沙和尙以爲之輔，池君之言，值得爲辦國貨事業者之奮勉。</p>
<p>婦女起來　婦女對於國貨，關係最是深切，服用之權都在她們手裏。上次聽葛成慧女博士講演，她說：「倘使丈夫一定要買外賃，妻子可以提出離婚來對付他」這句話眞是爽快乾朡，大可爲一般愛用外貨的男子作當頭棒喝。我們决定先出一期「婦女與國貨」專號，以示提倡，希望女同胞們大家起來幹一下。</p>

<p>「詩禮傳家」，「書香第裔，」這些，破硬牌，到這年頭兒，除掉丢在茅坑裏，是末有第二條出路的了。敗落戶，丢臉。暴發戶，吃香。</p>
<p>不錯，六世祖，七世宗，做到了一人之下，萬人之上，果然是再威風不過的了。但是子孫不爭氣，一代不一代，典典賣賣，吃吃用用，甘習下流，不圖上進，弄得不文不武，不上不下，破牆門間裏儘撑着「詩禮傳家」，「書香後裔」等硬牌兒，請問有何用處？假使這個敗落戶的街坊，一朝發跡，成爲一個暴發戶，那麽，不拘是趕大車出身的，或是開窰子出身的，地方上的名流紳董，都會趕他拜把子，通家譜，親熱凑趣。暴發戶起造房屋，侵佔了敗落戶地土地，敗落戶不依，頭給暴發戶打開了，紳董們雖合敗落戶是老世交，竟也會帮着暴發戶說話，勸敗落戶將就些兒的。</p>
<p>我們中國有數千年文化之歷史，不愧爲「詩禮傳家」，當得起「書香後裔」，但是除此之外，吃盡當光，一無所有，活現着一副敗落戶眉眼。而日本呢，男勤女儉，竟成了不可一世的暴發戶，合紳董式的英美法德拜把子，通家譜，分庭抗禮起來了。九一八，一二八，一切侵城掠地的勾當，敗落戶怎一次不是被暴發戶打得頭破血流，那一羣跟暴發戶稱兄道弟的紳董們，怎一次不勸敗落戶式的中國將就些兒？暴發戶侵了土地，打傷了人，逍遙法外。敗落戶吃盡了虧，受足了氣，除了吞聲飲泣，眼淚望肚裏嚥，還有甚麽辦法　　没出息的敗落戶，動不動掮出「詩禮傳家」，「書香後裔」等硬牌來，那眞丢盡了六世祖，七世宗的醜！</p>

<p>我們吃了砒霜，水銀，立刻七竅流血，腹痛頭暈，嗚呼哀哉尙饗，這呌做「急性中毒」。貪嘴的朋友，吃了河豚，毒蕈，還以爲味很鮮美，不可言喩，那曉得未幾毒發，這河豚和毒蕈的寃鬼，便來要你老人家的性命，像閻惜姣活捉張三郎一般的神速，這也呌做「急性中毒」。患肺結核的朋友和打嗎啡鍼吸紅丸的老槍，雖然閻羅王一時不來請你老人家去白相，究竟你老人家已經掛過　了號，最近的將來，便要做閻府入幕之賓啊！這呌做「慢性中毒」。</p>
<p>報載有人在日本横濱醉翁亭飯店，拾着一封加床塞期寫給咸爾來森的英文信。大致說：「在過去的一九三一年十月間，日本某醫學校，成立一毒華急進藥品研究社。其目的，在用科學方法，將一切毒品，配置在人類必需品之内。其中毒素，有令人終身絶嗣的；丨即衣服料所藏之毒。丨又有令人患虎烈拉的；丨如化妝品或使用具等，均有此種毒菌加入。丨其害支那人，用心毒辣，自可槪見；吾輩旅居華境，亦不可不加審愼也」！又說：已電致政府，喚起人民注意這一類的話頭。本來，日本人最狡獪陰險，難免不師王鳳洲毒嚴東樓的故智。這封信的發見，不是予吾人一個「警告」嗎？</p>
<p>我們要曉得我們爲了貪便宜，喜歡用仇貨，這便是「慢性的中毒」，也即是「慢性的自殺」，和打嗎啡針，吸紅丸，生肺結核，有甚麽分别！現在日本人不耐煩起見，以爲中國人的慢慢地滅種亡國，好生討厭，爽爽氣氣，還是在中國人所愛用的貨物裏面，放些毒物進去，免得患着「慢性中毒」的「睡豬」，丨日人稱我的尊號丨天天痛苦，日日呻吟，早些往生西方極樂丨也許便是猶太丨吧。這是日本人的一番美意，我們不要誤會纔是丨</p>

<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>昨天在宴會席上，聽得德國留學生方本初君說：「柏林某哲學家，最近發明了一種隠身術，這眞是海外奇談了，這位哲學家製了一身特殊的衣服，一具特殊的面幕，穿戴了，走到朋友家裏去，朋友都聞聲而不見踪影，」但不知道這身衣服和面幕，是什麽質料製的？竟有這樣神秘的功效，科學眞萬能啊！可惜尙有一種聲息，若然連得這種聲息都没有了，那豈不是更好了麽！</p>
<p>隠身術，是我國素來有的一種舊說，瑯嬛記：「主父旣胡服，夜恒觀天象，一夕，有神人自天而降，授主父以隠身之術，」但　是在事實上却從没有發見過，如果眞有這種隠身術，那麽這隠身人獨往獨來，無不如志，富貴之家，珍寳貴飾，可以任意取求，美妾嬌姬，可以姿情淫樂，那富貴之輩，豈不要起了恐慌麽？</p>
<p>記得從前有個笑話：「某甲在術士處，學得隠身術歸，作了法，問他的妻道：「你瞧見我麽？」他的妻說：「你站在我前，怎麽會得不瞧見你呢，」某甲以爲作法未合，及重行畫符焚咒，再問其妻，妻答如故，這樣的若干次，妻頗厭煩，便託言不瞧見了，某甲大爲得意，逕自跑出去，見肉舖中掛着纍纍的肉，他就試取一個豚蹄，不料肉没有取得，却挨着屠夫的一頓痛打，」</p>
<p>日本是一個徵兵制度的國家，年來窮兵黷武，實行全國總動員，所以新兵的募集，大有雷厲風行之勢，但是日本人想出種種方法來，逃避入營，不是把眼睛弄成深度的近視，便是挨着餓減輕身體的重量，因爲近視眼和身體瘦弱的，都没有入營伍的資格，還有一種迷信，若要避免入營，懇求三十三歲的婦人，拔取三根毫毛兒，用紅色的布包着，縫在衣襟裏，便是一種隠身術，可以避免檢查員的毒眼，那是多麽可笑啊！</p>

<p>熱河是已經失陷了！戰事的重心，刻下是吃重在古北口喜峯口冷口三處。聽說冷口是早已克復，喜峯口經宋哲元將軍迎頭痛擊，大敗敵師。古北口也在堅持之中。三口成品，這樣才顯出中國軍人的品格。若是像湯玉麟的守熱河，數天之内，連失四個要口，那簡直是不成器，而成爲喪家之犬了（却酬）</p>

<p>— 徐本熙</p>
<p>我們可以看見很漂亮的人物爲了一二個銅子和黄包車夫或小販爭論。甚至，不巧的話，說不定還要高抬貴手，賜他們一二下巴掌。在善意方面來說，好像上海人節儉得連一二個銅子也要打算一下。</p>
<p>其實，我們且撇開資産階級說話。你在大庭廣衆之下，看見過一個穿着西裝的靑年爲了掉下一個銅子而不惜屈身拾取嗎？反之，理髮館裏定價四角而你要給他們一元，以及上館子吃飯小賬加一已經算在内而你還把找頭給侍者的一幕，究竟這額外的賜予是統傳的定例呢？抑或是生存在都市裏的漂亮階級者所必具的習慣？哲人哲事，眞使我百思不解</p>
<p>同樣是生活的滿足，修飾和吃便優勝行多多。這是多麽高超的玄學？其實，乾脆地來說一句，一個人旣高興爲一二銅子而和黃包車夫計較，也絶對犯不了再假充布爾喬亞裝闊面塲。其如對勞動階級錙銖必計爲漂亮不恤裝塲面者之多何？上海人生活的邏輯，又多了一個矛盾的例證。</p>

<p>第三回終負解鈴心登門　錯暗憐丫角願推食分奬</p>
<p>不料他一進門，府上的人，不問三七二十一，就把他轟了出來，說是我們老爺說了，以後不許你來，你别進這大門了。這麽樣的大姑娘，無緣無故的，受了這樣一頓敎訓，你想，人家面子上，怎樣擱得住呀？江氏這一頓話，把桂枝心裏那一分委屈，完全說了出來，桂枝不聽猶可，一聽之後，心裏頭一陣酸楚，兩行眼淚，就直流下來。積之知道哥哥那道命令，已經頒下實行了。這絶對不是一種假話，否認是否認不了的，承認可又不便承認下來，只得作色道：這是我家那聽差混帳，那有這個樣子說話的。回去我一定重重的責罰他。桂枝臉望了他母親，却道；這那裏能怪底下人，上頭人没有話，底下人就敢這樣說嗎？積之道；我剛剛由衙門裏回來，這些事完全不知道，等我回去問明白　了，再來和老姑娘道歉。桂枝道；二爺有這幾句話，我們就滿意了，千萬請您回去别問，問出不好來，又給我們加上不是。我們母女兩個，又窮，又是房門裏人，鬧着可是有寃無處伸。說着，嗓子一硬，在脅下抽出一條手絹，又去揉擦眼睛。積之到了這時，雖是要用話來安慰人家，也覺得無法可以措詞，呆呆的站在屋子裏，一句話也說不出。江氏往日對於積之，總是加倍的客氣招待的，今天却是態度十分冷淡，積之在屋子中間，手足無所措的站着，也並不能用什麽言語來安慰他們。這時，他們娘兒倆，一個低了頭坐着垂淚，一個低了頭縫補衣服。積之老在這裏站着，自己也是覺得無聊，因之向江氏連拱了幾下手道；千一個對不住，萬一個對不住，總是我對不住，請老姑娘多多原諒，這一回事，實在我是不知道的。我若是在家裏，决不會有這件事發生的。說着，自己無精打彩的就走了出來。（二七）</p>

<h3 id="c260">談健忘 <a href="#c260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— 郁達夫</p>
<p>五分鐘的熱忱，是說中國人對於任何的奇恥大辱，在五分鐘後便會忘記的，比利南柯山的樵夫，雖則經過時間的長短有點不同，但都係健忘則一也。說起健忘，似乎也不一定是中國人獨有的特性，記得在德國文學家軼事裏，也曾看到過一則：</p>
<p>戲劇作家兼文藝批評家勒辛Ｌessing氏，有一次在寫作之餘，出去散步，於途中遇見了一位送信的郵差；「有我的信没有？」勒辛問。「先生呌什麽名字？」郵差返問。勒辛抓着頭皮，想了半天，却終於想不出自己的名字。所以只好苦笑着說：「讓我回家去問一問來」。</p>
<p>像這一種集中注意力之後的失心狀態，似乎是各國人所通有的，不過中國人的健忘却來得更實際一點。譬如軍閥的火併開始，互發通電的時候，兩方各駡得狗血淋頭，誓不俱生。但不久之後，又化干戈爲玉帛，一刹那間便稱兄道弟，情逾骨肉了；軍閥們是如此，政客們也是如此。我們只敎把舊報拿出來一翻，便可以看見許多這樣的事實。國民革命軍到上海的時候，宣傳揭貼上所要打倒的，儘是些北洋軍閥。所畫的是一個烏龜，身上掛着一個軍閥的名字。易幟之後，却張三李四，都是同志了。有通緝明令的張宗昌被殺之後，政府還給以撫恤。替父報仇的某某，國家也予以特赦。五四運動起後，大家都主張着非孝，現在的憲法條文裏，却又規定兒子有孝敬父母的義務來了。除去這些實利主義的健忘不談之外，則一般的健忘，對於我們人類的益處，的確也是不少。</p>
<p>第一，最普通的事實，就是晚上有了不得了的急事，一宿之後，早晨起來見了太陽，就什麽也冰消霧散，所急的事也覺得可以有出路了，這是任何人都常常在遭遇的經騐。第二，生死的痛苦，是盡人皆知的，幸虧健康者會忘記死，所以纔去經營事業，形成社會；女人産後，會忘記臨盆的痛苦，所以又會去生第二第三的小孩，保存種族。現代英國散文家RoberＬynd所著的一篇「無知的快樂」“Ｔhe　Pleasures　of　Ignornce”裏，也曾談起過這些，我在這裏却想把末一字易作Forgetfulness，呌作「健忘的快樂」。對這題目的最具體的證明，就是西太后於戰敗之後，將海軍經費拿來營造的那座頤和園。現在日本帝國主義者的軍隊，似乎只以長城爲界，不再南侵了。我不知爲了航空救國之故，特煩電影皇后等提倡娛樂救國而得來的許多愛國捐，會不會去廬山或西湖造起第二座頤和園。</p>
<h3 id="c261">街道的展覽 <a href="#c261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— 侍桁</p>
<p>在街道上，在這東方最繁華的城市的街道上，你們都時常看見過那使人不可過目的醜惡的展覽，那些形形色色的殘疾者吧？</p>
<p>在廣大的馬路上，有電車汽車馳聘，兩旁的側咱上擁着來往過路的人，就在這些行人的衣衫下，隨時都有坐着或是匍匐着的殘疾者，他們或是斷了臂，或是折了腿，或是瞎了眼，或是爛了肉；他們的頭幾乎總是向地上磕，對着那些來往的過路人，希望有人或者會從口袋裏取出一兩個銅板丢在那放在他們面前的托鉢中。但錢是不容易就有人肯丢進來的，於是他們苦呌着，哀鳴着，特别顯示出他們身體上最難看最惹人憐悯的部份，以獲得人類的同情心。如果這舊有的殘疾還不能夠惹起人們的憐憫心的話，那他就要裝出偶然地，而其實是他故意地，再跌傷他的身體的某部份，鮮血滴落在地上，他的神經感到一種不堪的痛苦時，他的吼呌，他的悲鳴，也便能夠使行人覺得眞實而悽慘，於是他的托鉢中，也便更能多收到幾個銅板了！我親眼曾見過一個斷了半截的腿的殘疾者，匍匐在一家學校的門前，故意在石階上跌破了他的鼻子，血濺在地上，他便臥着不起，好像是對着天，又好像是對着殘忍的人類，呌着，駡着，哭泣着，那嘶聲，那慘象，使看了聽了的人覺得像是身處在獰惡的地獄裏。</p>
<p>這樣的悲鳴或慘况，我從不忍聽，我從不忍看，對於我，他們像是惡魔似地，使我躱避着他們，所以，我忠實地講，像這樣的殘疾者是從來没有受到過我的一文的施捨。因爲讓我走近他們的身邊，丨縱是繁閉着眼睛，拿錢丢進他們的托鉢裏的那勇氣，我是絶對没有的。有時我遠遠地瞥見或只是意識到有這麽一個醜形臥在前邊了，我的神經立刻便會起了痙癰，給我的心投上一層沈重的暗影。</p>
<p>我記得我以前在讀文學史的時候，浪漫主義者，或理想主義者敎訓我們說，文學者的任務是應當盡力隠藏或避免觀察現實的醜惡，而作着美化人生的工作，這話也許是有道理的吧，但不是在我們這如今的社會上。你能夠終生關在屋裏，不上一次街道來麽。而你又怎樣能夠避免看見到這種街道上的醜惡的展覽呢？還有什麽樣的現實的醜惡是比這更甚的呢？</p>
<p>不能隠藏也不必隠藏了這現社會的一切的潰傷，總有一天，就是這些醜惡的殘疾者的吼呌，會曳倒了這整個的殘忍的社會吧。</p>
<h3 id="c262">「嘗試」解 <a href="#c262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>陸放翁詩：「嘗試成功自古無」，胡適替他下一轉語：「自古成功在嘗試。」並說；「我生求師二十年，今得嘗試兩個字：作詩做事要如此，雖未能到頗有志。」陸放翁身世之慨甚深，眼見國破家亡，局勢一天不如一天；那些賣國主和的固「全無心肝，」即愛國主戰的也「空喊口號不着邊際，」所以憤然道：「嘗試成功自古無！」他的意思，是說救國要有整個計劃，切切實實去做，靠僥倖取巧是不會成功的。（其意甚明，請看原詩。）</p>
<p>而我們的胡適博士，從這句詩的反面學得做人的秘訣。他看破中國社會是凌亂的社會，什麽都不上軌道；要在這個社會登台做大人物，第一就要投機。譬如買彩票，中了頭奬，豈不很闊了嗎？你若終生不買彩票，你終生没有中頭彩的希望；頭彩從買彩票中來，這就是胡適博士所謂：「自古成功在嘗試。」也就是上海人所謂「碰碰運氣看」。</p>
<p>我們的胡適博士，他是中了頭彩的；留美學生亦多矣，而他獨成爲新文化導師，中英文化基金委員，北平政治分會委員；還有很多的好處，他到湖南走一趟，就有五千元的×敬。這就是他自己所說的：「我生求師二十年，今得「嘗試」二個字；作詩「做事」要如此，雖未能到頗有志。」我們恭喜他：「有志竟成！」</p>
<p>自五四運動以來，有人皆「嘗試」，無處不「投機」，這便是新文化運動的最好成績！嗚呼！</p>
<p>（附註）胡適一生看風掛蓬，見機說話的證據極多，請參看我近編胡適文譜。</p>
<h3 id="c263">滕王閣 <a href="#c263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— 問鵑女士</p>
<p>一到南昌，就去尋滕王閣，但走遍了南昌城，也不知道這四海聞名的滕王高閣，究在何處，於是默念著王勃序上的話，從江邊沿途尋覔，走到水上公安局的門前，遇見一個老者，便上去探問道；</p>
<p>「老先生，你知道滕王閣在那裏嗎？」老者嘆息了一聲。</p>
<p>「這裏就是滕王閣啊！你看見了還不知道！」他手指着那矮小卑陋的公安局房屋，不勝感慨地說。</p>
<p>然而我還是莫明其妙，明明是公安局，怎麽硬說他是滕王閣呢？經過那老者的一番解釋，才曉得這有歷史價值的建築物，早已燬於兵火了。後來有人在閣的原址造了這水上公安局。</p>
<p>老者又說：</p>
<p>「這個閣，還是唐朝顯慶四年，滕王元嬰都督洪州（南昌古號洪州）時建造的，本有内外二閣，外閣在潮王洲上（唐朝時候就倒塌了）内閣就是這滕王閣了。唐高宗咸亭二年，洪州都督閻伯嶼曾經修過一次閣，王勃的序，便是那時候作的。其後明太祖在「天下太平」以後，也曾到過南昌一次，在這閣上大宴功臣，並把陳友諒所養的一隻鹿，放到西山去。臣子們迎合他的心理，在閣前造了一個大牌坊，題爲「天下第一樓。」萬曆年間遭了一次兵火，幾乎燬去大半。清初又重新修好，直到最近六年前這一次大火，方才送了終。」老人咳嗽了一回又繼續說下去；</p>
<p>「從前交通不便，火車没有通的時候，凡是出門的人，大都是坐船走水路的，這個閣靠在江邊上，地勢又好，凡是送别的人，都在這閣前設筵祖餞，歷代以來·都是如此的。丨丨現在是，唉！唉！什麽都完了。」老者說到這裏，搖搖頭，接著還不知咕嚕了些什麽，便慢慢往東邊走了。</p>
<p>我一人呆呆地立在這廢閣前面，想著老者最後的說話，不禁發生了許多幻想：這小小的樓閣，不知聽過了多少惜别的言詞，見過了多少臨歧的眼淚；閣如有知，怕也被他們攪擾得不堪了吧！被這些離愁别恨壓迫得喘不過氣來了吧！就是不遭兵火，怕也會被悲哀壓塌了的。現在索性燒却，倒也乾凈，誰能說丘八先生一定是煞風景的人呢！</p>
<p>只有那兩條顔色不同，性情各别的河水（撫贛二河的合流，水色一黄一清，絶不相混。）還是終日終夜相依相傍地互相厮守著，怕是看夠了樓頭的分别之苦，而永不敢相離的吧！</p>

<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>汽車在小街道上轉了幾彎，駛到馬路上來了，增加了速力，不一刻又轉彎了。海泉坐在車中看不清楚是那一條馬路。他只是直覺着汽車是在大西路海格路一帶兜了幾個圈了，便在一家洋房前頭停住了。大家從汽車裏走出來，耀星打發汽車走了後，便按了一會門上的電鈴。在這時候海泉望見離這家門首不遠，就立着有一名巡捕，看見有人坐汽車到這裏來，也不甚理睬的樣子。</p>
<p>等了一會，一個西洋婆子開門走出來迎他們。</p>
<p>「這是什麽地方？」</p>
<p>他問耀星。</p>
<p>「不要多嘴。你們跟我來就好了。」</p>
<p>大家便跟着他上了樓梯。上到了二樓，再走上三樓上來。在三樓後頭的一間房門首，耀星停了足。海泉看見在門框上面，釘着一個精圓形的白骨牌子，上面刻有「１７」兩個小黑字，耀星敲了三下門，門便從裏面打開了。海泉看見裏面已經坐着四五個人了。有兩個是前兩天晚上會過面的。有三個是他所不認識的。他看見領袖陳華民還没有來。</p>
<p>三十</p>
<p>海泉看見了他所崇仰的名作家李一香穿着一件灰布棉袍兒，雙手交互地歛進袖筒裏，在房裏面走上走下，有時又擺動一下他的腦殻，像在思索一種什麽哲理。他忙走上去，恭恭敬敬地呌了一聲李先生，然後伸出右手來，向他要求行拉手禮。海泉是有意的向那兩位同來的靑年示威，表示他是認得大作家李一香的。</p>
<p>「啊密，密司脫林。你，你怎麽此刻才來？你，你，你們靑年人，應該比，比，比我們老前輩早來才對啊！」</p>
<p>李一香雖然是老氣横冬地敎訓了海泉一番，但還是熱烈地和他行了一個拉手禮。海泉和李一香拉了手後，又走去請敎那兩位他所不認得的靑年。他看見一個是臉色蒼黑，身材像鶴那樣長瘦，嘴唇紫黑。海泉便想，這個人莫非是吃鴉片烟的。另一位是身材矮小，蓄着尺多長的頭髮，披在後面。海泉又想，這是藝術家的特徵了。</p>
<p>海泉發揮了一陣交際才能後，便退下來，坐在耀星的傍邊，正想問耀星爲什麽還不見陳華民來。但是耀星不等他開口，先笑着對他說：</p>
<p>「你怎麽總是擺出那樣迂腐的樣子，猪拖狗扯！……」</p>
<p>耀星雖然是在說笑，但是高聲嚮氣地說。海泉臉紅了，暗恨唐耀星的刻薄。於是他想起了今天早上在公共汽車裏朱渭道先生對他所說的話來了。</p>
<p>「老唐，聽說你要衝突，朱渭道先生，是不是？」</p>
<p>「誰說的？」</p>

<p>譯孟却斯德導報</p>
<p>由减少輸入品與增加輸出品以節制日圓的可能性、所以很微弱、這是一個不斷的連環、通貨膨脹、因此更可確定、其膨脹的程度、要看政府向國民或銀行募償的能力而定、由視察各商辦銀行的財力、能見還有些舉債的保證金、而日本爲侵略他邦及帝國主義者擴張版圖之故、確能大大的犧牲、雖然這樣、預算案的情形及國外收支的差額、在此後數月内、恐怕都要比前更劣、而日本不借國外經濟的帮助、殆難維持其現在的軍費、</p>
<p>約自去年七月至今、通貨膨脹、已有明證、例如物價昇高、各種貨價漲落的不符、日圓匯兌價的更行暴跌、以及生活費用的大增都是、普通批發物價指數、在最近三月之内、已增加百分之十五以上、而零售物價指數、已增加百分之六、日本銀行的生活指數、在七月與十月之間、增加百分之七·五、工資似未見增加、伹是没有最近的统計可得、倘然自一九三二年三月以來、米價不因空前的豐收而大跌、生活的費用、一定還要多多的增加無疑、然而米價雖在二月與十月之間、跌去百分之二十、而麥價却漲起百分之三十五、棉紗漲價百分之五十五、鋼價漲到百分之五十以上、生絲自六月到十月、從最低點漲起百分之九十、其一半的原因、是絲繭的歉收、已登記的失業人數、在一九三一年十月裏是四十三萬九千、在一九三二年六月裏、增加到四十八萬二千、此是最後調查所得之數、不過此後或許要減少、因爲在最近數月之内、工商業已受到通貨膨脹應有的一時的鼓勵與惑人的與　了、</p>
<p>去年九月的棉紗出品、比一九三一年十月要多百分之三·一、棉織品産量多百分之七·九、而絲織品（連人造絲在内）産量多百分之三十一·二、但是全體工業生産（十二種主路貨品）的增加、不過是百分之之二·五左右、因爲其他貨品的生産低落之故、米價的跌落、已使早負重債的農民、大受影響、雖然日本的國會、在九月裏議决年撥救濟２金約三萬萬日圓、但是這一筆欵子、祇有三分之一會到農民的手裏、其餘是指定救濟中央及各地勸業銀行之用、各地的勸業銀行、地位殊屬很不穏固、而私設的商業銀行、也有外强中乾之象、存欵和墊欵二者、特别是墊欵中投資部分、自一九三一年九月以來、已繼續衰頽、這種緊張的情勢、於放棄金本位後、在一九三二年的上半年、曾緩和一時而還債的按成數發給現金、現在仍能安定人心、</p>
<p>輸出入的差額</p>
<p>在一九三二年的起先九個月内、日本（包括朝鮮·台灣·琉球）的輸入品、其總值不計零數、約十萬零五千四百萬日圓、而輸出品總值、約九萬三千八百萬日圓、比較一九三一年同時期、輸入總值增加八千九百萬、輸出總值增加四千九百萬、所以可見的入超是從七千六百萬增加到一萬一千六百萬、然而這些增加的數目都是虚擬的、實由日圓的跌價所致、照金價計算、在一九三一年起先九個月内、輸入總值是美金五萬一千二百萬元、在一九三二年同時期内、跌至美金三萬三千九百萬元、而輸出總值則從美金四萬五千四百萬元、跌至二萬九千二百萬元、所以可見的入超、是從美金五千八百萬元跌至四千七百萬元、棉織品的輸出量、曾有很大的增加、在一九三二年内、幾加到二倍、伹是棉織品的平均輸出價格、照金價計算、在一九二九年是每千碼美金一百零六元（合二百三十日圓）、到去年九月有裏跌至美金三十五元（合一百四十七日圓）、差不多跌去三分之二、由此可見貨價的低减、一半是日貨競賣的結果、因爲日圓價格大跌之時、日本棉貨的金價、比其他各國跌得更多之故、英聨邦帝國的棉織品、在同時期内、其輸出價格、照金價計算跌去不及百分之五十、</p>
<p>關於出入超的最近數目、可見的與不可見的、狠難得到、但是依理推測、頗有不久恐就有不利的恐慌、日本債劵在國外市塲的價格、已經疲滯了幾個月、這便是這種憂懼的兆徵、在一九三二年最後三月内、可見的輸出入差額、或許有一些很大的轉機、膨脹政策的第一步、或可鼓勵輸出品較甚於輸入品、而在去年下半年内、日本的國外貿易、其可見的差額的順利、也是當然之事、</p>
<p>不利的主因</p>
<p>然而與此可能性相反的、還有其他幾種主因、略便得講述一下丨丨就是照外幣計算的外債、用日圓付息的增加、這對於預算案一定是一個重傷、日本在滿洲以及中國其他各部的投資、收入的减少、由航運及到日本去遊歷的人所得利潤的减低、浩大的軍費與日本在國外的外交費、向外國借用長期或短期資本的减少、再加以在滿洲繼續的投資、存金的數目極少、須經極大的困難、始　再行運貨、日本銀行的存金、在一九三一年的正月底、有八萬三千一百萬日圓、而在同年九月底有八萬一千七百萬、自此以後、存金　减、到去年十一月底、祗有四萬二千八百萬日　了、</p>
<p>况且製造工業的發展、雖因增加輸出品之故、必定繼續進行、然而也有限制、因通貨跌價、就成本而論、出售時固可得較多的日圓、但是輸入的原料、必須用跌價的日圓付出、此項利益、便爲此一事實所限、所以凈得的利益、除於輸入以後、到出貨時日圓價格再跌外、在於國内生産成本（例如利息與工資）、和出售時多得的日圓之數、有差别而已、等到正在增加的生活費用、迫使工資昇高時、此種差别就要消滅、</p>
<p>日本有兩處産金新地、確已發見、近來己引起某某幾方面的重視、這兩處實際上都是沙金産地、其所在已名聞一時、而且對於日本財政情狀的改善、未必有　多的帮助、由上面所述關於日本財政和經濟情形的各事實看來、就知道日本决難立於對世界其餘諸國抗爭的地位、而且欲得歐洲列强諒解干涉滿洲事件、亦屬無效、</p>

<p>孔氏繼稱、日方於每次軍事以後、必散放種種謠言、圖緩和空氣、按之實際、完全爲一種誘惑作用、其得寸進尺之野心、始終未變、他日必又恢復獰猙面目、再謀大舉之侵略、蓋毫無疑義、中央對華北軍事、已有嚴密之準備、誓與敵週旋到底、外間妥協直接交涉等謠傳、絶對無稽、在今日而言對日妥協、非喪心病狂、即毫無心肝者也、</p>

<p>最後談及迭克推多制問題、記者詢以德之希特勒、意之墨索利尼、均以迭克推多制、使國家中興、君意今日之中國、適宜於迭克推多制否、孔謂、中國今日不在制度問題、而在人的問題、迭克推多制固佳、試問何人能實行獨裁、各方意見多端、政令不一、一事之興、議論風生、均在文字上做工夫、而見諸事實者極少、甚願國人團結努力、抵抗外侮、否則國亡無日、更有何制度之可言、孔氏言下、不勝感慨云、</p>

<h3 id="c317">上海的國難 <a href="#c317" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e317" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">317</a></h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>九一八而後，咱們中國便突然「國難」起來了。國旣已「難」，應當是沉痛得很，這在政府曾經多次下令「全國一致下半旗誌哀」的一點上看來，便可知道政府對於「國難」最是非常重視而且熱心，似乎任是何等鎭靜，而「國難」二字總是已經首先喊了出來。而我們老百姓，因爲這旣然「名正言順」所以也就大膽的跟着喊得更起勁。</p>
<p>就上海而論，「國難」的呼聲，當然更是熱閙。有一個很長的時期，許多愛國同志的衫袖上都纏着黑紗，還印着「共赴國難」的四個白字，何等熱血，何等「愛國不敢後人」。其後一二八戰爭發生，上海眞的「國難」了。許多身無餘錢而有手無寸鐵的人們，給日帝國主義屠殺焚燒，只落得妻離子散，家破人亡。因爲他們旣没有搬家的可能，又没有得着人民也可以武裝抵抗的命令，可是老爺太太的汽車上却飄揚着英美國旗，老早便呼奴喚婢，連烟槍洋狗一同，全家搬往租界。在聽罷留聲唱片的「洋人大笑」和四圈麻雀之餘，也穿得整整齊齊升上屋頂花園，聽聽遙遠的槍砲聲或用望遠鏡觀火，以表示他們不忘「國難」。再其後，國軍遵命退往眞茹，在五五和約中寫明了上海中國不得駐兵之後，有些人揑了一把冷汗，有的跑到焦土瓦礫中去掘尋妻兒父母的白骨，而老爺太太們却謝天謝地，笑逐顔開了。這時候，國難在上海，當然已成過去，很自然的，在跳舞塲，在酒排間，在按摩院，在跑馬廳，所謂「國難」，早已消失得無影無踪。自然是普天同慶，天下太平。</p>
<p>然而到現在「跳舞救國」「游藝救國」等雖然都喊得力竭聲嘶了，可是「航空救國」却繼之興起而響澈雲霄，可見上海的人民對於「國難」仍是很有興趣。至少是因爲這樣的「救國」並不何等麻煩，只消大家拿出錢來，便可以對於「國難「加以點綴。而且據說這樣的「救國」，最是來得有效。</p>
<p>最好的是長城北的馬喊人嘶，熱河邊的飛機大砲，在上海都完全不能聽見。即使打死了千萬農民化身的中國士兵，到底和上海不關痛癢。加之又有直接交涉之風聲，日帝國主義一定不致於再打到上海來的，於是乎像如今這樣的熱心「救國」，的確，是足夠而有餘了。</p>
<p>然而有一等人却也願意上海還有一次戰爭發生，因爲和一二八事變時一樣；一個亭子間可得二十元的租金，到底是不可多得之機會。</p>

<p>彷彿聽過不少的大人先生們說過，中華民族已奠定了屹然不撓的基石，歷代雖被外族征服過不少次，然結果總是外族被同化·現在可有些異樣了，或是基石移動了方向·我且舉一樁渺乎其小的事來說話，丨丨我國現代的服裝，自洋風襲來以後，不用說，新派人物，都以着洋服爲禮尙了，就是舊式中人，也幾多像戲猴披彩褂般的在試用·如此洋化，也就是被外族同化了的鐵證。只有日本人印度人，算還能保待着他們固有的民族精神，試看普通的一般日人總是着和服，印度人也總捨不掉他們有國時代的披圍，雖然已是亡國奴·這說來果然是小事，國人也當知所以警惕了。</p>

<p>— 陳迪清</p>
<p>噹！噹！噹！這是－－學院下午一時的上誤鐘，已經敲過了。一個個的學生走進敎室裏去，手裏還拿着一本洋裝書，因此知道這是上英文課哩。</p>
<p>學生越來越多了，在整個的敎室裏，發出一種喧囂，熱閙，混亂，狂笑，咯拍，……的聲音來，程序非常混亂得很。</p>
<p>英文敎授吳先生來了，身上穿了一件黑灰色的長袍子，架上玳瑁眼鏡，身材並不高，或者比起平常人來還要　一點，看起來好像是二十多歲的靑年。當他看了敎室門的時候，老實說好像有點害怕，兩隻被玳瑁眼鏡遮住的眸子，總是向左向右打滾。然而，當他踏上敎台他又微笑着，這種笑，對於滿堂的學生好像是可愛的表露。</p>
<p>「各位同學，請靜一點，不要說話了」吳先生上了敎台後很微弱的聲很温和地說：</p>
<p>敎室裏的空氣告訴我們，的確，今天的課和平常的課不同，個個學生的腦子裏，都盼望着期望着欲說又還不敢說的一種重大問題，在平時没有効力的命令式的敎員的話，今天格外有効了，雖然是這樣地微弱的聲音，可是馬上就把這喧囂，混亂的整個敎室沉靜下去了。個個學生都目怔怔地盼望着把這重大問題解决。</p>
<p>「哈！哈！今天諸位爲什麽到了這樣齊？」吳先生好像很高興接着又這樣說，使全堂學生都笑起來。</p>
<h3 id="c321">手叚自來水公司断水民　市仲 <a href="#c321" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e321" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">321</a></h3>
<p>「吳先生！你還不知道嗎？學校裏在下星期舉行月考了，今天大家都來希望你出個題目來。」一個同學好像在回答，大家都鼓起掌來。</p>
<p>「呵！原來如此哪！哈！哈！……」吳先生笑了起來，全堂的狂笑聲，鼓掌聲，一齊作發。</p>
<p>「吳先生！這次考試究竟是怎麽樣！還是照以前的辦法吧！請你快出一個題目來，我們好預備，預備，……」另一個同學又站起來說，接着又一陣鼓掌　。</p>
<p>「當然照以前的辦法。」</p>
<p>「趕快！趕快，出題目哪！」</p>
<p>「好！好！諸位不要吵閙，我還有話對你們說啦！關於這次考試，諸位要應該了解我的苦衷，凡做什麽事，都應該顧到雙方面，使兩方面都能得其利。譬如以前幾次考試，在一二星期以前，就出了題目給你們，對於你們雖然有利，可是對於我敎授方面那就不好了，不是說我太馬虎了，就是說我太撒瀾汚了，這不是單單顧到你們一方面嗎！所以這次考試就無論如何都不能出題目了，好顧到………！</p>
<p>「不行！不行！」吳先生還没說完，就有許多反對聲說：</p>
<p>「反對！反對！」</p>
<p>「绝對不行！絶對不行！」</p>
<p>「絶對反對！絶對反對！」在這雜　的反對聲中，還有咯咯拍拍，砰砰……的地板聲桌子聲，哨子聲………</p>
<p>「諸位不要閙，不要吵，我的話還没說完哪！…一學生聽了頓時又稍靜寂起來，吳先生又接着說：「還有一點，就是去年敎育部不是派人來調查嗎？同時就有一種不好的批評，說我校學生成績太壞，太馬虎，這種批評不單有妨礙學校名譽，就是你們將來也是很受影響的。因此你們無論如何都要硬着頭皮求點學問來，將來日後做事的工具，所以從今後起，對於考試方面不要太馬虎了，這次就無論如何都不能出題目了；不過，關於分數一切，我看卷子的時候可以對你們宮氣一點，就算了，包你們及格就是了……」</p>
<p>「好！吳先生旣然題目不出，那麽，請先生劃一個範團來。」一個同學被先生的話感動了，轉了一個要求。</p>
<p>吳先生没有辦法，只得承認了，學生第二個要求，不過，吳先生又聲明一句說，你們要保守秘密，才好，不要對各班同學敎員，或外邊的人說，</p>

<p>店員通訊</p>
<h3 id="c323">條陳 <a href="#c323" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e323" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">323</a></h3>
<p>編者先生：處在資本主義鐵蹄下的勞動者丨店員和學徒丨對於雇主的一切，從來是只有默受，絶少參加意見的機會。因此勞資雙方非常隔膜，而做店員的一切·疑問·隠痛·也就無從冰釋·發洩。自從跚刋闢了店員通訊欄以來，對於店員的質疑問難，都不憚煩屑地詳細解答；這種服務社會，謀利人羣的精神，實值得我們的道頌和感戴。現在我有一個問題，請先生賜與解答：</p>
<p>我是本埠××實業公司一個練習生，當我離别校門考進這公司的時候，有許多同學都異口同聲地向我道賀，連介紹我的那位敎師也這樣地說，「這公司的管理如何好，辦法如何好，營業如何發達，待遇如何優厚，你進了這個公司，前途的希望！委實無窮」。那知，事實竟大大不然，這公司不過徒負時時譽而已：</p>
<p>光陰是三年如一日底過去了，而希望無窮的我，竟變成一個失望的靑年，年齡雖是不斷地增長，而依然操守着輸送生涯，（職務是送包故又名送包生）我在這三年當中，除了拿過六塊錢的花紅而外，其餘幾塊錢一月的月規錢，有時還要扣除因婚喪·疾病·而請假時的代價。現在已是念一歲的人了，先生，你呌我怎樣對得起父母，怎様對得起自己丨</p>
<p>現在我爲了公司前途的光明，和自己進取心理驅使，想向新來的經理，作下列的貢獻；我們的靑年·别父母·離鄉井，遠首習商。爲的是，想學個一技之能，作爲噉飯的本領，來服務社會，瞻養家室。所以經理對於學徒，好比第二父母；習藝師長·對於學徒，負有敎導的責任，現在我們幾十個練習生，除了做完十二小時的轉送工作而外，再也没有什麽訓練·敎導·因此過了三年，依舊是本來面目，對於商情·閱歷·一樣不懂，這樣對於練習生的前途和公司的本身，兩蒙不利，這點想請新經理注意。</p>
<p>公司一切業務，向由經理一人主持，各部主任不過做經理的耳目，中間雖經過幾度的改組。可是，總是換湯不換</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>，因此，我們的　拔，全靠主任的　怒　嗔爲轉移，現在二十世紀公認處世藝術之一的「拍馬屁」固然是求高升的絶好捷徑，可是，我們這涉世未久的練習生，懂得的能有幾人，何况，馬屁手段，「志者恥爲」呢？因此·學了三四年而依然做個練習生的，就大有人在。（我也是其中的一個）主任呢：因爲自己大都從「馬屁」中來的，所以只求自己的薪金增加，地位安定，就不惜爲虎作倀，苛待下級同事。例如，營業員缺貨照賠，就是他們獻功的妙策之一，經理對於主任，唯言是聽，在一二八的戰後，竟不惜借緊縮的名義，減低一二十元小夥友的薪金，來增加在近百元一月的主任身上，弄得怨聲載道，人懷去心，而經理反强要招待週到，存貨清楚，這種治標不治本，强人以所難的手段，想請新經理糾正。</p>
<p>璖現在内部要擴充了，據高級職員傳出來的消息，將要招添新職員，練習生呢，照舊不動，先生，這可苦了，我們練習生，難道就做到老死嗎？照營業員的職務，練習生能担任的，約在半數，倘給靠十元的代價來做十幾塊的職務，眞是感激不盡，這是何樂不爲，何况我們公司裏的職務，外來的人，恐怕未必能夠勝任，因爲要管存貨，記帳，等等的額外工作，今有人不用而反事外求，這種捨本逐末的政策，我實在不願他實現。爲了許多同志的出路着想，想請新經理採納我的管見：</p>
<p>以上的意見本想直接底寫給經理，可是，仔細一想，我這一片熱忱，倘蒙鑒察，到也罷了，設不幸而誤觸虎威，那末，開除小事，還有反動份子的頭銜，我實不敢領受啊！末了，我要向先生聲明一句，就是不虚搆事實，不攻擊他人，全憑良心的指使，來促經理的覺悟，並替我們受着同樣遭遇的同志來做一個喊呐，先生，我想你一定不致因文字的不通而拒絶吧：</p>
<p>祝你　　　　撰安：</p>
<p>一個練習生陸一萍謹上</p>
<p>編者按：陸君是本埠素魚盛名的×國貨社的職員：最近我們連次接到這社裏職員的來信，都不約而同地訴說。證明陸君信上所說的「怨聲載道，人懷去志。」確並冰是虚構。爲着希望這一　較爲規模粗具的國貨社，蒸蒸日上起見，我們也利用牠新經理初來的機會，把陸君的條陳介紹給他。</p>
<p>陸君第一個條陳，希望予練習生以正眞練習的機會。這一層，我們可以到事實上尙在外人管理之下」的郵政局裏去看看。他們對於每一個新進來的低級職員，都輪流地呌他到各部份去實習；所以一年地載之後，對於全部狀况，大槪可以略知梗槪。</p>
<p>他第二個條陳，希望經理對於下級職員的考成，有更加正確的觀察。這一條似乎很難做到；因爲經理要綜理全店事務，對於下級職員的考成，自然不能不借重中級職員爲耳目。但是現在旣經弄到「怨聲載道，人懷去志」，顯見中級職員的工作，自有其不公不正的地方；爲着要使全店的情况安定起見，那就不能不忙裏偷閒，自己去考查一下。一方面將可以造就的人才，擢升幾個，一方面將不公正的中級職員，查他出來，處分幾個</p>
<p>他第三個條陳，希望公司在擴充的時候，假使需要職員，儘量在練習生内提拔。這一層實在很對。我們希望新經理原來要這樣做，不過因爲高級職員傳言之誤，致引起陸君的焦慮，如其傳言不悞，那末實在有打消原定計劃，採用陸君條陳的必要。</p>

<p>（九）結婚與主義</p>
<p>美利堅西部的氣候，比别處同在温帶中的所在，的確更乾燥些，更清朗些。伍逸在加利福尼亞大學裏混了三年，眞有些不願意再走咽給一片潮濕的空氣，所包圍着的上海來了：但是一篇洋洋灑灑的博士論文，已嘔心瀝血的做了出來，價值超過了黃金數十倍的一紙畢業文憑，也已如期領到，鍍金之目的已達，再在美國留連着幹什麽？伍逸可不是傻瓜！</p>
<p>伍逸在西雅圖起程回國的時候，先打了一個電話給王玉麟，報告自己的行期；很希望在船到上海的當兒，馬上可以在埠頭上和三個闊别已久的老朋友見面。但是，結果很使他難堪，那天到碼頭上來歡迎他的，却祗有一羣素不相識的碼頭小工，三位老朋友竟影跡全無。</p>
<p>「王公館嗎？請王律師說話！」在一片極憤懣的情緒中，伍逸忍着氣，直奔×飯店，看定了一間房間之後，便忙着打電話上王玉麟的事務所去；答復是「王律師在家裏」，伍逸便立即再向王公館詢問。</p>
<p>「啊！伍大博士嗎？今天不凑巧，内人剛在家裏生産，竟不能上碼頭來接你！請原諒！你生氣嗎？」王玉麟在電話裏出現了，說話怱促得了不得。「此刻，孩子還不曾落地。你在×飯店三○五號嗎？我一定就來！請原諒！請原諒！」</p>
<p>伍逸這才消了一半的氣，很高興的放下了聽筒來；同時，便回想到去年的春天，玉麟所寄給他的一幀結婚照。忙打開衣箱，一陣亂翻，居然給他找到了。</p>
<p>「啊！好一位美麗的太太！」照片上現出了一位嬌小玲瓏，落落大方的新嫁娘，使伍逸不由自主，讚美起來。他雖然已見過一次，但是此刻重復的瞧瞧，才發現了王玉麟的艶福。他捧着這一楨八寸大的照片，悄悄地靜坐着出神，像丨個久居在上海的人一樣的鎭靜。</p>

Around 8:00 AM, the enemy advanced to near Shizuizi. Our army then launched a fierce barrage from both sides, while the front also launched a counter-attack.

<p>(Beiping) He Zhuguo said, "The enemy is now using our army's attack at Shimen Village as an excuse to launch their second phase of operations, invading our Huimazhai on the east bank of the Shi River. It can be seen that the ambition of the violent enemy is increasing unabated. Currently, the enemy has over a hundred people who have arrived near that location. Our army has long been determined to annihilate the enemy. If the enemy violates our front lines, we will resolutely strike them head-on. In this battle, the enemy will definitely use the name of puppet army harassment to carry out some kind of aggressive scheme. As I deem the defense to be of utmost importance, I will leave Beiping and return to my post within the day." (29th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e5">Japanese Army Cannot Easily Conquer Beiping <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) An editorial in the Russian Pravda newspaper observes that the Chinese army's resistance is very strong along the Hebei border. If the Japanese army does not replenish its forces, there are unlikely to be large-scale battles in the Beiping area. Furthermore, given the complex environment, attacking Beiping will not be easy. The Japanese army occupying Jehol consists of no more than three infantry divisions and one cavalry brigade and may not be willing to attack Tianjin and Beiping again. Considering their troop deployment, it is feared that they will attack Chahar before Tianjin and Beiping. As for their 7th and 8th divisions moving towards the various passes of the Great Wall, it is probably because they fear the Chinese army will threaten their left flank or rear from the Pingluo area.

<h3 id="e11">The Inherent Contradictions of Japanese Imperialism in its Aggression Against China <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>All changes in history are undeniably governed by economic conditions, and the path of national struggles changes its methods in accordance with changes in economic conditions, like a shadow following a form, inextricably linked. National struggles before the eighteenth century were struggles under the feudal system. Production under the feudal system took land as its primary element, so the methods of its national struggles also centered on the issue of land. The motivation behind the aggression of strong nations against weak nations often stemmed from population growth and the resulting insufficient production. Their actions often involved nothing more than seizing territory, attacking cities, enslaving people, and engaging in outrageous extortion. Since the Industrial Revolution, technological innovations have emerged day by day. The national struggles arising from the insufficient production of the feudal era have also gradually transformed their methods into a competition for consumer markets. The purpose of all conflicts between capitalist powers and the aggression of powers against weak nations lies in acquiring a backward nation in production to absorb their surplus products. Even after the European War, there were indeed some territorial changes, but the intention was still nothing more than the division of colonies and the transfer of ports. While also supporting small nations to maintain military superiority, the central issue remained the establishment of their economic hegemony, organizing their lines of exploiting weak nations with surplus products.</p>
<p>Japanese imperialism's aggression against China is, of course, no exception. The motive behind this aggression against China stems from economic panic, and the economic panic stems from overproduction. If the goal of invading to resolve overproduction is its driving force, then its primary purpose is to monopolize the consumer market in the three northeastern provinces. It is very obvious that the inherent contradictions of capitalism are naturally becoming increasingly acute, so all actions arising from these contradictions will inevitably fall into contradiction or be an unavoidable result. Since the September 18th Incident, the decline of Japanese imperialism's trade with China has been an undeniable fact. This is partly due to the anti-Japanese movement by the people of the country, and partly due to the natural decline in purchasing power in the aftermath of war and turmoil. Although the Japanese boast about the progress of trade with Japan in the three northeastern provinces, according to our understanding, some of the Japanese goods imported into the Northeast are an increase in Japanese merchants' inventory, and even more are materials for Japanese construction and military equipment in Manchukuo. In reality, consumers belonging to the people are likely decreasing rather than increasing. If one were to say that the power of iron hooves and bullets can increase the purchasing power of the Chinese people, then how could this be true? Therefore, for the past year and a half, Japanese imperialism's aggression against China has only destroyed China's consumer market, causing the state of overproduction among Japanese imperialism and the powers to continue to increase. The contradictions of the entire capitalism system are becoming increasingly acute. What Japanese imperialism seeks in its aggression against China is the opposite of what it gets.</p>
<p>If the Japanese must comfort themselves with the thought that their invasion has not yet been completed, then may I ask, what will happen when the invasion is indeed completed? Manchuria and Mongolia are what the Japanese regard as resources. If the Japanese were to succeed in the three northeastern provinces, then their greatest hope would naturally be to develop the industries of Manchuria and Mongolia as stated in the Tanaka Memorial. If this were indeed the case, then the inherent contradictions of Japanese imperialism would certainly leap forward to an irreparable extent. Since the current economic panic is a high degree of overproduction, then the result of developing the resources of Manchuria and Mongolia and increasing the state of overproduction would not add another great driving force? Would the route of economic panic not sink even further into an abyss for all time? What kind of power will the Japanese use at that time to absorb this unprecedented surplus of products? Regarding this point, we do not wish to use subjective prejudices to make self-deceiving quick remarks. Rather, based on the facts, the Japanese bourgeoisie is deeply afraid that after the development of Manchuria and Mongolia, most of the industries in the Japanese mainland will be defeated due to insufficient competition. Therefore, if the result of Japanese imperialism's development of Manchuria and Mongolia is that Manchurian and Mongolian products are sufficient to supply the needs of Manchuria and Mongolia and the Chinese mainland, then it would be a major contradiction with the European and American powers, and the contradiction with the Japanese mainland would be impossible to resolve.</p>
<p>Whether successful or unsuccessful, Japanese imperialism's aggression against China only increases its inherent contradictions and cannot resolve its current panic, as described above. Therefore, those who hope for a compromise may use this to flaunt their cleverness in enduring humiliation. However, we must state here that Japanese imperialism's aggression against China arises from the inherent contradictions of the entire capitalism. The result of the aggression is sufficient to make the contradictions of Chinese society rapidly become acute. The environment of the times is conducive to the completion of the objective conditions for China's anti-imperialist national revolution. Therefore, the theory of compromise only prolongs the time of Japanese imperialism's final struggle, placing itself in the ranks of the objects of the revolution, and compromise will ultimately fail to achieve its aim of escaping the environment where interests are concerned. This is something that the people of the country must understand.</p>

<p>(Beiping) A high-ranking military officer from Zheng Guilin's unit of the Righteous Army came to Beiping on official business. According to his account, at dawn on the 27th, the puppet troops of Li Jichun, Zhao [name missing], Zi Bin and others, along with a joint Japanese force, totaling more than 2,000 infantry, over 200 cavalry, carrying more than ten cannons and over twenty machine guns, advanced from the direction of Yiyuan Pass towards our army's positions at Xiaoxue Gou, Zaishan Yu Kou and other locations. At the same time, two aircraft were dispatched to assist in bombing our army. Our army then sent the 囗th and 囗th echelons to deliver a head-on blow, and dispatched the 囗th and 囗th brigades to bypass Yiyuan Pass from Baishanpo Zhangzhuang, attacking their rear. The enemy failed to succeed and retreated to Yiyuan Pass. Our army did not pursue due to a lack of ammunition. In this battle, more than thirty enemies were killed, and more than twenty guns were captured. Our army also suffered thirty casualties. The wounded soldiers have been sent to the rear hospital of the First Army Corps of North China in Tianjin. Our army's position is currently still firmly held at Wangzhuang Suzhuang.

<p>Memorial Service for Revolutionary Martyrs</p>
<h3 id="e20">Wang Zhaoming Speaks on His Thoughts on the Memorial of Revolutionary Martyrs <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Strive Forward with a Spirit of Sacrifice</p>
<p>We Should Emulate Them to Complete the Revolution</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Committee held a memorial service for revolutionary martyrs at 8 AM on the 29th. Lin Sen, Wang Zhaoming, Ye Chucang, and others attended. Ye Chucang presided over the meeting. Wang Zhaoming gave a report, the original text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>"Comrades, the revolutionary battle of March 29th is the most tragic page in the history of our Chinese revolution, and at the same time, it is also the most glorious page in the history of our Chinese revolution. Every year on this day, comrades of our party hold memorial services to commemorate this most tragic and most glorious historical event of the revolution. When we commemorate, if we ask a comrade to make a report and completely report the content, I am afraid it is impossible to do so in a short time. Generally, we have countless feelings every time we commemorate. Now I can only bring up one point of the feelings and share it with you. Before March 29th, most revolutionary comrades already knew that the uprising on March 29th would definitely fail. We only need to read Mr. Huang Keqiang's report to know that several important conditions were completely lost. First, we must ensure that the enemy does not know our news before the uprising, but according to Mr. Huang Keqiang's report, the enemy already knew our news before March 29th. This is one point. Second, we see in Mr. Huang Keqiang's report that comrades from various places who were rising up cannot gather in Guangzhou and are being hindered and monitored everywhere. Therefore, before March 29th, Mr. Huang Keqiang and other comrades knew that these two important conditions for the success of the revolution had been lost and expected that this revolution would definitely fail.</p>
<p>But since the comrades at that time clearly knew that this revolution was going to fail, why did they still do the March 29th event? This is clearly stated in the report at the time. One passage says, "Comrades in Nanyang donated a lot of funds to support the revolution. If they did not proceed due to the leakage of the opportunity at that time, how could they be worthy of the comrades in Nanyang, and they could no longer raise funds from them. Therefore, regardless of success or failure, they decided to start the uprising on March 29th." But how much money was raised at that time? The total amount was only 100,000 yuan, and as for those who sacrificed for this revolution, there were as many as seventy-two well-known people, all of whom were the elite of our party and the talents of the country. Why were they so clear about the failure, but still did it? The first answer is that the revolutionaries have a spirit of sacrifice, but where does this spirit of sacrifice come from? The second answer is probably different for everyone. In my humble opinion, every revolutionary must have a certain concept. He does his best for the revolution and knows that the revolution will definitely succeed, but it does not necessarily have to be achieved in his lifetime. As long as he can do a little bit to reach the road to success before the revolution succeeds, that is his lifelong responsibility. This is the source of his spirit of sacrifice.</p>
<p>To use road construction as a metaphor, to know that to build a wide and smooth road, countless small stones must first be used to fill it. The countless flesh and blood of us revolutionaries are these countless small stones. Only with the countless flesh and blood of us to do the filling work can the revolutionary road be completed. Therefore, revolutionaries only pay attention to the success of the revolution and do not care about their own success. If every revolutionary can do this, then the vitality of the revolution will continue and eventually lead to success. No matter what kind of environment is changed, or what kind of twists and turns are experienced, as long as the vitality continues, then generations of young people will continue to do the revolutionary cause, and the revolutionary cause will become more and more upward and more and more expanded. From March 29th of Xinhai until today, it has been more than twenty years. During these twenty years, China has indeed undergone many changes, and even now the work of the revolution has encountered great obstacles, but in terms of revolutionary power, it is much greater than in Xinhai. During these twenty years, has the vitality of the Chinese revolution been cut off? No, it has not been cut off. Since it has not been cut off, then we should emulate the spirit of sacrifice of the martyrs, identify the direction, and complete this revolutionary road. If our direction is correct, we should not have a temporary success mentality, but should move forward bravely, and use countless hot blood to form this road to success. Even if the first batch of people does not succeed, the second batch of people will continue to do it. If the second batch of people does not succeed, then the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth batches of people will continue to do it. As long as the direction of the revolution is correct and the vitality of the revolution is not cut off, the success of the revolution will eventually come. Today, when we commemorate the revolutionary martyrs, it is as if the revolutionary martyrs are standing in front of us, leading us to continue to move forward. Therefore, since we comrades have assumed the mission of the revolution, we should strive forward, so that our courage will not disappear, the vitality of the revolution will not be interrupted, and we can finally achieve our goal. The road of revolution has been opened for us by the martyrs. We who die later continue to fill this road with our flesh and blood, and work together to seek the final success, so that we will not fail the sacrifices of the Premier and the general martyrs."

<p>Met for Two Hours Without Special Developments</p>
<p>Adjourned Until After Easter</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Advisory Committee of the League of Nations, organized to monitor the Sino-Japanese dispute, has now read the notification of Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations and Secretary-General Drummond's reply. The Advisory Committee has not yet decided to issue a new statement to criticize Japan's views stated in the Japanese notification. However, the committee intends to promptly study various issues arising from the non-recognition of "Manchukuo." In addition, the representatives of various countries in the committee will also seek the opinions of their respective governments on the prohibition of the transportation of arms to belligerent countries. According to reports, the various issues arising from the non-recognition of "Manchukuo" include "Manchukuo's" request to join the International Postal and Telegraph Union and the status of consuls of various countries stationed in Manchuria vis-à-vis local officials. (28th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Advisory Committee met at 5:30 tonight and adjourned at 7:15. At the time of adjournment, the date of the next meeting was not decided, but it may not be held again before Easter. The Advisory Committee discussed the general situation arising from Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations, but decided not to reply. The Irish representative, Lester, first raised the issue of Japan's withdrawal, saying that he knew that this matter was only indirectly related to the Advisory Committee, but he felt that the Advisory Committee might as well take a stand and reply to Japan's notification of withdrawal. The reply should point out that although Japan has withdrawn from the League of Nations, it is still bound by Article 10 of the Covenant. The reply should also refute the claim in the Japanese document to the Secretariat that Japan has the right to independently interpret international treaties concerning the relationship between Japan and other countries. There was some discussion on this point, but it was finally decided that since the various sections of the Japanese document had already been replied to by the Secretariat, the Advisory Committee did not need to reply. The Advisory Committee then listened to a report by the League of Nations Deputy Secretary-General, Italian Biruti, on the issue of non-recognition of "Manchukuo." The report stated what actions should be taken regarding "Manchukuo's" request to join the Postal Union, and how to treat "Manchukuo's" stamps, coins, passports, and other items. This report is not yet complete and will be submitted to the subcommittee specializing in the non-recognition of "Manchukuo." This committee will convene a meeting after Easter. The Advisory Committee then discussed the issue of arms embargo in order to prepare the agenda for the embargo committee. However, the general opinion was that the attitude of a certain major country towards this matter was still uncertain, so there was nothing to do about this matter at present. It was felt that it was appropriate to wait a little longer to see the results of the arms embargo proposal related to the dispute with the two South American countries. The Czech representative, Jiseski (Czech Minister to Switzerland), made very clear remarks and asked about the United States' attitude towards this matter, but the American representative, Wilson, attended as an observer and remained silent throughout, neither participating in the discussion nor expressing the opinion of his government. Therefore, the date of the embargo committee meeting has not been set, but it will probably have to wait until after Easter. Today, only twenty-one countries attended the meeting, including the United States. The Turkish representative did not attend. The British representative was the Secretary of the Foreign Office, Kail. France was represented by Masigli. The German representative was Kaina. (28th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e24">Passes Arms Embargo <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>The Bill Seems Likely to Pass Soon</p>
<p>(Washington) The bill authorizing the US President to order an arms embargo has been passed by the House Foreign Affairs Committee today, and it seems likely to pass soon. What the House Foreign Affairs Committee passed was to authorize the President to order an embargo without consulting other countries. There is still some doubt as to whether the Senate will approve such broad powers in the future. The driving force behind this bill is entirely the situation in South America, because at present the US President can only order an embargo of arms to countries in civil unrest, and has no right to order an embargo to belligerent countries. At a time when trade between the United States and South America has declined year after year, members of Congress believe that the first step to restoring commerce in Latin America is to stop the war between Bolivia and Paraguay and Colombia, so that their funds for purchasing arms can be used to improve business routes and pay off public debt interest. This is why they are eager to embargo arms to belligerent countries in South America. (28th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to diplomatic sources, there is currently no consensus on the international level regarding the embargo of arms to belligerent countries since the British government voluntarily abandoned it. The League of Nations Advisory Committee also did not have a specific resolution at its meeting on the 28th. The US House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee passed a motion authorizing the President to handle this matter by a vote of sixteen to fifteen on the 28th. The development of this case is of utmost importance to the United States, as all countries are clearly looking to the United States for guidance on this matter. If President Roosevelt expresses something after being authorized by Congress, the League of Nations will have a unified action. (29th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Geneva) Our representative obtained information from the League of Nations that the Japanese government will not only continue to cooperate with various agencies of the League of Nations other than the Administrative Council and the General Assembly, but is also prepared to have Japanese representatives participate in all committees of the League of Nations. An organizational method is currently being studied to ensure that all agencies of the League of Nations in Geneva have Japanese diplomats and experts. It is rumored that the number of Japanese personnel in the League of Nations will be even greater than before the announcement of withdrawal. (29th Havas Dispatch)</p>

Therefore, a branch of the Far East Bank will be opened in Tokyo, and the restoration of the Bank of Korea branch in Vladivostok will be a condition for exchange.

<p>(New York) Last night, the Japanese representative to the League of Nations, Matsuoka Yōsuke, was invited to a banquet by the New York Japanese Chamber of Commerce. During the speech, he praised the United States, saying, "We have been striving in Geneva to make the Western countries understand the difficulties of Japan's current situation, but to no avail. Japan is a small country, located between the two major countries of China and Russia. Both of these major countries are in revolution, which is enough to worry Japan. China is surrounded by bandits, disasters, and poverty. The main cause of the turmoil in the Far East is the chaos in China. China does not recognize international obligations, which harms Japan. China has no ability to defend itself, because China is not a country but a group of various peoples. Japan has proposed to cooperate with China to seek peace and prosperity in Manchuria, but this proposal has always been opposed by China, especially after the Kuomintang came to power." He also said that the League of Nations has no ability to solve the China problem. (29th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Wang Jingwei has resumed his duties. On the morning of the 30th, after the Standing Committee approved the resumption of duties case, he immediately returned to the Executive Yuan in the afternoon to resume his duties. The Secretariat has notified all staff members to be informed (29th Dispatch).</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The military unification case proposed by Yu Youren and Sun Ke was discussed at the Central Political Conference for a long time and a considerable decision has been made. The principles are related to military affairs and are not convenient to announce (29th Dispatch).</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Jingwei said that the issue of the President of the Executive Yuan was brought up for discussion at the Central Political Conference today. The members advocated for his resumption of duty. Although he repeatedly declined, he could not insist because the members were determined not to allow it. He agreed to continue to maintain his position. After the Standing Committee approves it on the 30th, he will immediately go to the Executive Yuan to resume his duties. He originally intended to return to the country and go north to comfort the troops, but because his illness had not healed and because of the issue of the President of the Executive Yuan, all parties wanted him to resume his duties. Therefore, he will not be able to make the trip in the near future. After his illness has slightly healed and the affairs of the Executive Yuan are slightly sorted out, he will make the trip. In recent days, he has repeatedly received telegrams from Minister He and others, reporting that our army has repeatedly defeated the enemy's vanguard in the anti-Japanese war, so although he did not go, he was very pleased. However, in foreign operations, the whole country must unite and unite to strive for success in order to achieve the most victorious goal. As for the military expenses of the various armies in North China, he intends to discuss a plan with Chairman Chiang to stabilize the morale of the military and to not commit any offenses against the people, so that the cooperation between the military and the people will yield great benefits. The case of opening up the political power proposed by Committee Member Li Liejun was unanimously resolved by the members to be submitted to the Standing Committee on the 30th for discussion. The principles of this case are the same as those of the National Political Participation Council, that is, to implement the Premier's Three Principles of the People, so that the people of the whole country can participate in politics to promote the prelude to constitutional government and implement the foundation of democratic politics. Therefore, all members of the Central Committee expressed their approval. There will be a great discussion at the Standing Committee tomorrow. In order to concentrate the anti-Japanese forces, the Central Committee invited Comrade Feng Huanzhang to come to Nanjing to discuss major plans, but according to his telegram reply, it is temporarily inconvenient to leave the strongholds, so the date of his southward trip is still undecided.

<p>Naval Ministry Lodges Strong Protest with Tianjin French Consulate</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Foreign Affairs Section Intelligence Division of the Military Affairs Commission issued a statement on the 29th regarding the Tianjin Naval Hospital case, roughly stating: The Tianjin French Concession Naval Hospital has been closed for a long time and no one has inquired about it. Last month, the Military Affairs Commission sent Tianjin Mayor Zhou Longguang to negotiate with the French Consulate for its recovery. However, the French side demanded compensation for the back wages of French teachers and a donation for the Pasteur Institute’s chemical laboratory expenses. Both parties signed a contract, but due to lack of funds, it was temporarily suspended. The Military Affairs Commission is currently consulting with the Naval Ministry to jointly raise funds for the payment and recovery. The report stating that Zhang Xueming sold it is inaccurate.

<p>Clauses Started Being Proofread Yesterday Morning</p>

The Ministry of Communications sent Director of Telegraph Administration Yan Renguang, Section Chief Guo Shijing, and others to negotiate with them. As a result, because the contract clauses require translation and comparison in both Chinese and English, and there are still places that need to be re-corrected, proofreading began on the morning of the 29th and did not end until 8:00 p.m. Because the content of the clauses is complex, and every word and phrase must be carefully considered to ensure prudence, it will still need to be proofread several times before it can be completed. The contract is expected to be signed next week. As for the Ministry of Communications taking back the company's power to receive and send telegrams, taking over the Shanghai receiving and sending office, and the company applying for a water line landing permit, the company will fulfill these items after the contract is signed and hand them over separately.

<p>Fang and Shao Arrive in Beiping One After Another</p>
<h3 id="e43">Investigate the Tang Yulin Case Separately <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Shao Hongji Issues Statement</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The National Government sent Shao Hongji and Fang Benren to Beiping to investigate the case of Tang Yulin. Fang arrived in Tianjin on the morning of the 27th and took the evening train to Beiping. Shao took the morning train to Beiping on the 29th. According to Shao, Fang is investigating the military part, and I am investigating the lower-level administration. In fact, when Tang was in charge of Rehe, he forced the people to plant opium, embezzled and perverted the law, and imposed exorbitant taxes and levies. The facts are all there. The Control Yuan, in its capacity, should impeach him. This trip to Beiping for investigation is just to complete the procedures. However, how to adopt disciplinary methods in the future still depends on the Central Government. However, the scope of the investigation is only limited to Tang alone. Shao also said that the Control Yuan has a backlog of impeachment cases from all sides, which is difficult to clear up all at once. Among them, there are too many restrictions on the progress of cases involving political officials. Therefore, only three out of more than twenty cases, including Shi Ying's, have been submitted for disciplinary action. This situation is because politics has not yet been put on the right track and cannot give full play to the spirit of the rule of law. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Telegram from Fang County) To all newspaper offices:  Calamity has befallen Southern Henan, with bandits and drought arriving one after the other, burning, looting, and turning homes into ruins. The people have no food or clothing, exposed to the elements, with death on the roads, wailing to the heavens. Recently, even tree bark and grass roots are unattainable. The tragic situation is unprecedented. The spring plowing season is approaching. If farming is abandoned, the consequences are unimaginable. Although headquarters and the Henan Provincial Government have issued relief funds, they are a drop in the bucket. I implore you to have compassion for those who are hungry and drowning, and to show mercy to the suffering people, generously providing relief to benefit the disaster victims, preserve the remnants after the calamity, and save the nation's vitality. Respectfully telegraphing for instructions, I beseech your consideration. The First Administrative Meeting of the Ninth District Administrative Inspectorate of Henan respectfully bows.</p>

<h3 id="e87">Carries out an Anti-Jewish Movement Throughout Germany <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Picketers Warn the Public Not to Associate with Jews</p>
<p>The National Socialist Party Announces This Move as Retaliation</p>
<p>Reuter, Berlin, 28th:  The National Socialist Party announced today a universal boycott of all Jewish occupations.  The government is doing this to retaliate against the overseas scheme to eliminate Jews and exclude Germans.  The boycott in Germany is scheduled to begin at 10:00 AM on April 1st and will be carried out by boycott committees throughout the country.  These committees will be responsible for monitoring offenders and punishing them, and will be responsible for protecting the personal freedom of foreigners, regardless of their race or nationality.  The boycott will be publicized to the public, and German families will not subscribe to newspapers that do not participate in the boycott movement.  German stores are not allowed to place advertisements in such newspapers.  The anti-Jewish boycott committee must also be responsible for investigating German citizens who have deposits abroad and should use these funds to publicize the truth that Germany is currently very peaceful domestically.  The committee must strictly limit the number of Jews who can enter institutions of higher learning or serve as medical and legal professionals, so that their total number has a certain ratio to the total German population.  The declaration stated that the boycott should be carried out in a normal and peaceful manner and should not harm a single hair on any Jew's head.  The declaration severely condemned the Jews, referring to them as believers in Marxism and blaming Germany for not cracking down on immigration in the past fifteen years, which resulted in a small number of Jewish writers, university professors, and businessmen repaying kindness with ingratitude and inciting the world against the German people, etc.  Several towns in Germany have already begun boycotting Jewish businesses.  Stormtroopers of the National Socialist Party have been sent out to order Jewish stores to close.  Jewish lawyers and doctors in the Glokau area have been forced to cease operations.  Shops opened by Jews in the town of Gleiwitz in Upper Silesia are guarded by picketers from the National Socialist Party, and anyone who wants to enter the store to shop is prevented, so although the shops are open, there is no business all day long.</p>
<p>National News, Berlin, 28th:  The National Socialist Party stated that German Jews have spread slanderous false information abroad. As retaliation, a national economic boycott will be implemented starting on Saturday. Leaders of the National Socialist Party claimed that they were very angry about the way these people fabricated messages about physical abuse, etc., and broadcast them abroad. Almost all the reports sent by Jews to the United States are fabricated. Only an economic boycott of the Jews can stop them from wantonly slandering. However, the communique issued by the National Socialist Party is not in the form of an ultimatum, so it is believed that if Jewish organizations can guarantee that such messages will not be broadcast abroad in the future, the National Socialist Party may be able to end the economic boycott.</p>

<p>Roosevelt Also Emphasizes</p>
<p>National News, Washington, 28th:  Subcommittee Chairman Adams stated today that there is a compromise silver bill that proposes that the government purchase 500 million ounces of domestically produced silver as collateral for issuing silver certificates, that is, using the silver certificates issued to purchase the silver. He will redraft the provisions of this bill in his capacity as chairman and submit it to both houses of Congress immediately. It is expected that this bill will not disrupt the gold standard because the silver certificates issued are guaranteed by silver at market prices. In other words, each silver certificate is guaranteed by about four ounces of silver. Also, government budgets and social finance will not be affected by the purchase of silver, but the silver mining industry will receive tangible relief, and it is not impossible to increase foreign trade, because the purpose of this measure is to raise the price of silver. As for the silver bill proposed by Senator Wheeler at a ratio of sixteen to one, it is inevitable that the price of silver will be falsely set, and he cannot agree with it. He also said that this bill includes the essence of several silver bills in Congress and makes it a circulating medium based on the real price of silver. Only those who sell silver to the government have a speculative nature. If the price of silver falls in the future, these people will suffer losses, but since the purpose of this bill is to raise the price of silver, these people should not suffer losses. The proposers of this bill hope that it will be passed in this Congress. If it is adopted, it may not be necessary to force an international conference to agree on concrete actions to deal with the silver problem.</p>

<p>Troops Have Been Continuously Reinforced for the Attack</p>
<p>Shang Zhen Also Personally Went to the Front Line to Inspect</p>
<p>Beijing Correspondence:  According to a telegram from Kaiping, (1) According to a secret report, the headquarters of the Japanese Kwantung Army has decided to occupy all the passes of the Great Wall, and Lengkou, located in the recessed part of the Great Wall among the six major passes, is particularly important. If Lengkou is occupied, it will not only directly threaten the flanks of the various armies east of the Luan River, but the Chinese troops near the passes to the west will also have to retreat. Therefore, the Okamura 40th Regiment of the Nakamura Mixed Brigade of the 10th Division, the Tani 5th Infantry Regiment of the Suzuki Brigade of the 8th Division, the Taniguchi 1st Artillery Regiment, the Kawada Cavalry Regiment, and part of the Hattori Mixed Brigade drawn from Xifengkou, and part of the West 8th Division have been dispatched to launch a fierce attack on Lengkou from various routes, aiming to capture Lengkou in a short period of time. Currently, various units of the enemy army have gradually come into contact with our army. (2) Since the morning of the 24th, the enemy has continued to use armored vehicles to cover infantry attacks on our Xiaojiaying Madaogou positions, which have been extremely fierce. At the same time, aircraft were used to repeatedly bomb the positions. Our officers and soldiers vowed to resist to the death, killing many enemies. We also suffered casualties of more than ten officers and more than two hundred soldiers. (3) A certain unit that detoured towards a certain place suddenly attacked the enemy's rear around 2:00 AM on the 24th, using hand grenades and broadswords to strike the enemy fiercely. The enemy was unable to resist and retreated slightly. Two armored vehicles were captured and dozens of prisoners were taken. (4) After two days of ineffective attacks, the enemy's infantry was quite silent after the afternoon of the 24th, in addition to using aircraft and artillery fire to fiercely attack our positions. (5) Because enemy planes bombed repeatedly for days, our officers and soldiers suffered heavy casualties, resulting in a shortage of vehicles and materials for transporting the wounded. However, most of those with minor injuries returned to their positions on their own after emergency surgery to continue killing the enemy and did not want to be transported to hospitals in the rear. Shang Zhen, Commander-in-Chief of the 囗 Corps, reported by telegram from the front line to Beijing, Telegram 1, "Lengkou Battle Report (1) I went to inspect the high ground front line in the Madaogou area today and gave instructions to the officers. (2) The morale of the officers and soldiers on the front line is very high. Although they have been fighting for days and suffered heavy casualties, their determination to kill the enemy and serve the country has increased. Division Commander Huang Guanghua, and Regimental Commanders Lin Zuozhen, Jiang Jike, and Lin Jialin are particularly excited and motivated. The work of constructing fortifications near the Great Wall is extremely solid. (3) The front line was quite silent today. Only four aircraft in formation dropped more than twenty bombs over the positions, and artillery fired dozens of shells at our positions. Our losses were minimal. Shang Zhen bows. Unsealed." Telegram 2, "At 2:00 AM this morning, 囗 Division 囗 Regimental Commander personally led the 囗 Battalion of the regiment from the high ground northeast of Madaogou to attack the enemy's rear at Fenghuangzi in Xiaojiaying. At that time, the enemy was extremely panicked, surrounded on all sides. After a fierce battle of about two hours, our 囗 Battalion Commander Zhang Kexun bravely rushed into the enemy's formation first, and the officers and soldiers of the battalion followed, shouting thunderously, killing countless enemies. Battalion Commander Zhang also died in battle in that area, and more than thirty soldiers were wounded or killed. At the same time, a unit of the enemy attacked our Madaogou Chen Di from the Mountain God Temple and was repulsed by our officers and soldiers. More than a hundred enemy corpses were abandoned in the mountain gully this morning. The enemy side is quite shaken and seems to be retreating. Shang Zhen bows. Afternoon seal."</p>

<p>Many Enemies Killed and Captured in Kailu</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Attack Was Foiled by Cui Brigade's Surprise Attack</p>
<p>Now Fighting Back Jointly with Sun Dianying's Army</p>
<p>Ping News: A certain officer of Li Haiqing's Northeast Volunteer Army arrived in Ping yesterday from the battlefield. According to him, "Our army coordinated with Su Bingwen's army last year to attack the capital of Heilongjiang Province. After the defeats at Zhalannor and Manchuria, we were running out of ammunition and had no reinforcements, deeply in enemy territory, with increasing pressure. On January 15th of this year, we arrived at the border of Rehe. Due to years of hard fighting, our men and horses were exhausted. We originally planned to rest our soldiers and replenish our weapons and ammunition before launching another counterattack. Unexpectedly, we came into contact with the enemy again immediately after arriving in Kailu and fought repeatedly. The enemy ultimately did not succeed. The battle on February 7th was the most intense, fighting continuously for three days and nights, driving the enemy back to Tongliao, seizing more than a hundred enemy rifles, capturing forty-two puppet soldiers, killing more than thirty Japanese soldiers, and capturing two Japanese flags and various military supplies. At 4:00 PM on the 23rd, more than thirty large enemy trucks, four armored vehicles, and more than two hundred cavalrymen suddenly pushed back our outposts. At this time, our army's position was on the west bank of the Xingmeng Company River, and the outposts were on the east bank. After Commander Liu (Jingyu) led the team to counterattack, the enemy was driven back, four large trucks were captured, four drivers and two Japanese soldiers were captured alive, and one machine gun and several rifles were captured. We continued to pursue until 6:00 PM, when more than thirty large trucks were surrounded in Kongyuan (a large courtyard divided into three small courtyards). On the order of Commander-in-Chief (Li Haiqing), we decided to resolve the situation at 11:00 PM. Because we lacked guns and ammunition, we selected more than sixty daredevils to jump into the courtyard and attack with hand grenades. By 2:00 AM the next morning, we had occupied one of the three courtyards, destroyed eight enemy trucks, and killed more than thirty Japanese soldiers. While we were resolving the situation, Jin Tuanzhang of Cui Xingwu's brigade suddenly led his troops to attack our army's rear, putting us in a situation where we were attacked from both sides, making it difficult to take care of both. As a result, only sixteen of the more than sixty people who jumped into the courtyard escaped. Our army retreated to Balahuoshaomiao to reorganize our forces and prepare for another counterattack, but troops under Cui's brigade guided the enemy to surround our army again. After a fierce battle lasting a day and a night, our army lost two regimental commanders and more than two hundred soldiers. Because we lacked guns and ammunition, we could not hold out for long and retreated to Daqintala, where we discussed resistance with Yao Brigade of Feng Zhanhai's army. We heard from the brigade commander that Feng's main force had retreated two days earlier. At this time, there were no reinforcements, and the enemy was pressing hard, so we resisted once again in Daqintala. Because the enemy's artillery fire was fierce, we retreated to Wudan City. The city was already empty and could not be stayed in, so we rushed to Cone Mountain and contacted Commander-in-Chief Sun (Dianying), who ordered my First Army to join Sun's army and launch a joint counterattack. The rest of the troops gathered at Banzhaita, but because the villages there were sparse and had already been occupied by friendly forces, we gathered in Dolun. We are currently replenishing weapons and ammunition, training soldiers, and waiting for orders to counterattack." (27th)</p>

<p>To the Editor: I was shocked to read in the Pinghu News section of your newspaper on the 27th that the Minsheng Factory purchased a large batch of Japanese goods. Upon investigation, the Anti-Japanese Association took away 30 packages of yarn for inspection at the Minji Dyeing Workshop outside the Xiaonanmen on the 20th, and they were entrusted to be dyed by the Zhida Factory in Zhapu. Local newspapers deliberately misreported this, and a letter has already been sent to correct it. Our factory has never had the Anti-Japanese Association come to the factory for investigation. We are writing to request that this be included in the letter section to make a correction. Please take note, Editor of Shenbao. From the Minsheng Cotton Weaving Factory of Qingyangdi, Pinghu.

I feel stimulated in spirit, especially during this serious national crisis when the nation's territory has been taken away and the nation's status is extremely dangerous. We should commemorate the glorious deeds of the revolutionary martyrs of the past and continue to implement their unfinished legacy, to recover the lost territories of the Northeast and to eliminate the communist bandits domestically. With the spirit of struggle and sacrifice of the martyrs, and with the determination for long-term resistance, then even if the violent enemy is strong, they will eventually succumb. We should (1) recognize that the martyrs were young people with aspirations, the pillars of the nation, and their sacrifice is the nation's greatest loss. (2) Recognize that the revolutionary actions of the martyrs were inspired by the Three Principles of the People, giving rise to national spirit and creating glorious deeds. (3) Recognize that the success of the Xinhai Revolution was due to the determination of the past ten revolutions, unified solidarity, and facing the national crisis together. Then there will be a day when our lost territories in the Northeast will be recovered and national humiliation can be washed away." The meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM.</p>

<p>Jin Shuren Requests Funds for Settlement</p>
<p>The righteous army of Su Bingwen, Wang Delin, Li Du, etc., which retreated into Russian territory, has recently entered Xinjiang via Russia, reaching more than 10,000 people. The reporter of the Shen Shi News Agency yesterday met with a certain gentleman who is a representative of the righteous army stationed in Shanghai. According to him, the army is determined to reorganize in Xinjiang and then go to the front to continue the war against Japan. However, Jin Shuren, chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial Government, said that the province's finances are strained and there is no way to provide relief. He sent a letter to the central government requesting that if the army needs to be reorganized in Xinjiang, it is necessary to allocate a certain amount of settlement funds each month in order to maintain it.</p>

<p>Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission Chiang Kai-shek, accompanied by his wife Madame Soong Mei-ling, left Nanjing by night train last night and will arrive in Shanghai at 8:00 this morning. The Garrison Headquarters and the Municipal Government, upon receiving the news, have ordered the military police to provide proper protection at the Zhenru North Station and other places.</p>

<h3 id="e109">No Problem with President Wang's Resumption of Office <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Expiration and Abolition of the Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement</p>
<p>Unification of the Monetary System and Consolidation of Various Tax Revenues</p>
<p>Vice President of the Executive Yuan, T.V. Soong, left Nanjing by night express train the night before last and returned to Shanghai at about 8:00 yesterday morning. Reporters from various newspapers went to visit Mr. Soong at his private residence. According to his statement, the issue of Wang Jingwei returning to his position as President of the Executive Yuan will be formally resumed after a decision is made at this morning's Central Political Conference. The details of Mr. Soong's statement are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Wang to Resume Office Soon <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Soong indicated that there is absolutely no problem with Mr. Wang returning to his position as President of the Executive Yuan. The resumption of office will be implemented after the Central Political Conference decides this morning. He will be fully responsible for all political affairs hereafter, while he will specialize in financial matters. Therefore, what I can discuss with you at the moment is limited to financial matters. Although I still concurrently serve as Vice President of the Executive Yuan, the Vice President has no right to make statements related to the Executive Yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e111">News of Chiang's Arrival in Shanghai <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The reporter then inquired whether the news of Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission Chiang Kai-shek's upcoming visit to Shanghai was accurate. Mr. Soong did not give a definitive answer, only saying that he had seen this record in the newspapers, but he did not deny it either. It is said that Chiang will come to Shanghai within a day or two after attending today's Central Political Conference.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Unify Subsidiary Currency <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Soong also said that various commercial groups have requested the unification of subsidiary currency, and this matter can be done. In addition to copper and silver subsidiary currency, there is currently no nickel currency in our country. Nickel currency is more difficult to imitate. Most countries often use this nickel currency to transform into military supplies, such as bullets, etc., in times of emergency. The supply of raw materials is difficult. As for the implementation of the gold standard, it is also difficult, because countries that implement the gold standard buy silver with gold more cheaply, while countries that do not implement the gold standard find it extremely difficult to buy gold with silver. Whether the World Economic Conference will be held in May has not yet been decided, so whether I will go to Europe to attend is also not yet scheduled.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Tariff Agreement <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement will expire and become invalid after May 16th. There is no question of renewal. The agreement only stipulates that the import tax on certain goods will be maintained for one and three years respectively. Initially, because our country concluded agreements with various countries on tariff autonomy, Japan could not be an exception. Therefore, the minimum tax rate was maintained, hence this provision.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Consolidate Tax Revenue <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the consolidation of tax revenue, the North China region has already been returned to the Central Government, and there is no problem in the South China region either. Soong explained that the unification of tax revenue does not mean that tax revenue is unified only when the Central Government sends people to handle tax collection. Rather, it means that any method that can be handled in accordance with the Central Government's methods is considered unified. Therefore, the Central Government seeks to simplify the consolidation of tax revenue. As for the consolidation of salt tax, it is also better at this time than before.</p>

<p>Representative Departed North Last Night</p>
<p>Goods Will Be Shipped Later</p>
<p>The Chinese Women's Association for Relief of Northeastern Compatriots organized a comfort mission and raised comfort items. They departed for Beijing by night train last night and will transfer to the north. However, because the comfort items being transported north are extremely crowded, the second batch of items from the association may not be able to contact the Railway Bureau in time due to the tight schedule, and may be delayed until today to be shipped. The preparations and contact process of the association are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Preparations <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The personnel of the association who are going north are quite unfamiliar with the situation at the front. Yesterday, Ms. Wei Qiongying and four others specifically visited General Zhu Ziqiao. In addition to giving a detailed analysis of the recent situation at the front, Mr. Zhu also allowed Mr. Zha Liangyi to provide guidance after arriving in Peiping to facilitate them. The association considered the contact to be satisfactory and departed north by train last night. However, the comfort items that arrived later still need to be sorted, packed, and contacted with the Railway Bureau. The time is short, and they may not be able to travel together.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Ladies Going North <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>In addition to Ms. Shen Huilian, a member of the association, and Ms. Wei Qiongying, a clerk, Mrs. Ma Chaojun, a member of the Central Committee, and Ms. Wang Xiaoying, a member of the Legislative Yuan, are also going together.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Comfort Items <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>There are a thousand sets of single military uniforms, 31,000 pairs of rubber shoes, 1,100 sets of health clothing, 1,000 sets of lined clothing, 6,000 pairs of socks, 2,000 yards of gauze, 3,200 towels, 1,040 pairs of goggles, three large packages of white cloth, and several boxes of cigarettes.</p>

<p>Currently Verifying Postal Rate Standards with the Post Office</p>
<p>The China National Aviation Corporation's newly purchased Lorraine amphibious aircraft was shipped to Shanghai on the President Pierce liner the day before yesterday. The company immediately extracted it from the customs and temporarily placed it in the warehouse at the Dalei Wharf. Yesterday morning, the company's aviation department sent a technician, Mr. Wirth, to match the fuselage and hire a tugboat to drag it to the Longhua Airport, where the motor and parts will be installed. After a test flight at the airport, it will be put into operation on the Shanghai-Hankou line and has been named "Chongqing." In addition, the company, in order to verify postal rate standards, has sent staff member Cai Guangmo to the post office since the 13th of this month to jointly check the total number of daily mail items, using the average number of two weeks as the standard. The results of the secret inspection show that the previously determined standard of 21 yuan per kilogram for the first zone and 41 yuan per kilogram for the second zone paid by the post office is still fair. Whether it will be revised again remains to be negotiated between the two parties. As for the average number of mail items per day, the first postal zone is 1,681 items, with postal revenue of 420.25 yuan, with the most being sent to Hankou. The second zone has 535 mail items, with postal revenue of 267.50 yuan, with the most being sent to Chongqing. The average daily postal revenue for both zones is about 700 yuan. Although it is not enough to cover expenses, a surplus can be expected if passenger transport increases.</p>

<p>Zhu Qin'ao, Director of Dihua Station</p>
<p>Scheduled to Fly Next Tuesday for Preparations</p>
<p>The Eurasia Aviation Corporation considers Dihua Station to be an extremely important gateway for future entry into Russia and transfer to Europe. Zhu Qin'ao, Director of Lanzhou Station, has been specifically transferred to be Director of Dihua Station and is scheduled to fly to the station next Tuesday to prepare everything. At the same time, Zhang Fengjiu, Director of the Xinjiang Provincial Government's Office in Beijing, also sent a letter to Li Jingcong, Manager of the company, requesting that the route be completed as soon as possible to facilitate transportation. Jin Shuren, Chairman of the New Provincial Government, also entrusted the company to purchase various radio materials, which shows that the rumors that the New Provincial Government opposes setting up a station in Dihua are completely unfounded. The original letter from Mr. Zhang is copied below: To Mr. Xingwu: I received your letter asking whether the unrest of the Hui people in Xinjiang, as reported in the newspapers, has been quelled. According to the telegrams we have received from Dihua recently, there is no mention of the Hui people's unrest. The reports in the newspapers may contain errors. Please dispel your concerns. We hope that your company's flight to Dihua will be completed as soon as possible. Moreover, the routes passed are all safe areas, and there will be no hindrance to travel. We urge you to complete it with great effort and determine the schedule. The transportation between Beijing and Dihua will be smooth and convenient, and both public and private sectors will benefit immensely. Dedicated to your honor, respectfully, Zhang Fengjiu.</p>

Therefore, it specifically ordered the forces to make a detailed list of names and transferred it to the Local Association for discussion of disposal measures. It was decided to first find accommodation and then proceed with the resettlement issue. In addition, the wife of Wang Ziheng, Director of Logistics of the forces, ordered her ten-year-old son Wang Wendong to go out to buy buns yesterday morning, but he went missing. The matter was reported to the police station to find him.</p>

<p>Reportedly the Son of Martyr Zhongkai</p>
<p>His Mother He Xiangning Telegraphed for Rescue</p>
<p>Soong Ching-ling Visited and Comforted Ms. He Yesterday</p>
<p>Liao Chengzhi, the son of Central Committee member He Xiangning, was arrested by the Old Gate Police Station the night before last, suspected of being a communist. The reporter of the Nisshi News Agency specifically visited Ms. He at her private residence to inquire about the matter, and she answered in great detail. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Dropped Out of School and Returned to China <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Ms. He said that my son Chengzhi is 26 years old this year. He went to Germany in the 18th year of the Republic to study political economy. He has not yet graduated. Recently, because he was indignant about the violent Japanese invasion and the increasingly urgent national crisis, he believed that it was time to dedicate himself to the country, not to sit idly by and study. So he angrily returned to China. It has only been two weeks since he arrived in Shanghai. I have been ill recently. My son, having returned from overseas, often attends to me. He usually tells me about his father, Mr. Zhongkai's loyalty to the country and the tragedy of his martyrdom, urging him to work hard for the Party and the country and not to disgrace his father's legacy. My son has also been able to deeply understand this meaning and study hard. I did not expect that only two weeks after returning to China, this unexpected event would occur. What else can I say?</p>
<h3 id="e126">Arrest Process <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>It is reported that the Old Gate Police Station received a report in advance that my son was a communist. Five foreign armed detectives and two Chinese armed detectives went to No. 8 Wufu Lane, Shanxi Road, and took my son and two others (namely Luo Dunxian and Yu Wenhua) into a car and drove them to the police station for detention. At that time, there was no evidence. After the arrest, with the permission of the police station, at about 11:00 the night before last, five Western policemen and two Chinese policemen were sent by the police station in a car to accompany them home to see me and explain their wrongful arrest. The Western policemen also asked me if I was their mother before returning to the police station. I was extremely shocked and pained by this incident. I then thought that the country has its own laws. Whether my son is a communist or not, there are facts that can prove it and the law can resolve it. At this time, I will remain silent and not say a word, but ask for an early resolution in accordance with the law so that he will not be detained in a foreign prison for too long.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Engage a Lawyer <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Ms. He concluded by saying that this case can be resolved by our country's own laws. After it is transferred to the court, she intends to engage Lawyer Wu Kaisheng to defend him. The truth of this case will be revealed soon.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Telegraph to the Whole Country <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>To the military and political leaders of the whole country: My son Chengzhi was arrested by a foreign police station in Shanghai last night, but I do not know where he is being detained. I am willing to stay in prison with my son, but I do not want to stay in a foreign prison. I request to be transferred to the Chinese area. I am willing to die in the Chinese area, not in the concession. Please investigate and reply. He Xiangning. She also telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek, Wang Jingwei, T.V. Soong, Sun Ke, He Yingqin, and others, with similar content. In addition to sending telegrams, Ms. He has also asked the municipal government to quickly negotiate with the Old Gate Police Station and transfer him to the Chinese court for trial in accordance with the law as soon as possible to show prudence.</p>

<h3 id="e131">Court Hearing <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>On the morning of the day before yesterday, Wang Qiliang from Shaoxing, Secretary-General of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions of the Communist Party, was active in the Gonghe Road area of Zhabei and was arrested by the inspectors of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Under interrogation, Wang admitted that he was an important member of the Communist Party and that he had arranged to hold a secret meeting with Luo Dunxian (also known as He Yongsheng), Yu Wenhua (also known as Lao Yu) from Henan, Liao Chengzhi from Guangdong, and others at Yu's residence at No. 9 Wufu Lane, Shanxi Road, at 2:00 that afternoon. The Public Security Bureau ordered a number of detectives to escort the suspect Wang and requested assistance from the Old Gate Police Station at 2:30 that afternoon. The head ordered Chinese detectives Wan Yuke and others to go to the address. Luo Dunxian, Yu Wenhua, and Liao Chengzhi were successively arrested in the east wing of the building upstairs. In addition, opium offenders Yuan Jingeng, Fan Gengsheng, and women You Qiusi and Yao Yinshi were also arrested and brought to the police station for investigation. Luo, Yu, and Liao all denied being communists. Liao Chengzhi also stated that he was the son of the martyr Liao Zhongkai and that his mother was He Xiangning, a current member of the Central Committee. He was born in Tokyo in 1908 and later studied at Tokyo Kosei Elementary School. He returned to China in 1927 and was admitted to the middle school of Lingnan University in Guangzhou. Later, he went to Japan to take the entrance exam for the Imperial University but failed. He then enrolled in Waseda University. After the "May 30th" incident, he returned to China on his mother's order. In 1928, he went to Germany and enrolled in the University of Halle-Wittenberg. He returned to China at the beginning of this year. He went to Shanxi Road to contact a tea merchant named Ouyang Chun on his mother's order to transport tea to the Northeast to comfort the anti-Japanese soldiers. He never knew what a communist was and had no political affiliations. Yesterday morning, the police station sent the opium offenders to the First Special District District Court for a judgment by Judge Feng, who sentenced Yuan Jingeng to one year of imprisonment and a fine of 60 yuan, Fan Zhensheng to one month of imprisonment, and You Qiusi to two months of imprisonment. The rest were acquitted. Luo, Yu, and Liao were transferred to the Criminal Division 1 of the Second Branch of the Higher Court. The police station was represented by Lawyer Gan Jingxian, and Liao Chengzhi was defended by Lawyer Wu Kaisheng. The Municipal Public Security Bureau was represented in court by legal counsel Lawyer Zhan Jifeng. At 10:00, the judge Yu Hua, along with judges Zhou Han and Jiang Shuzi and prosecutor Zhong Qing, took the bench and interrogated them. Lawyer Gan from the police station rose and stated the circumstances of the arrest of the defendants and requested that the defendants be temporarily detained for the sake of the defendants' interests and re-examined in a week. Fucai's representative then brought Wang Qiliang, who had been captured, to testify in the case. According to Wang, he joined the Communist Party in April last year, initially serving as a branch secretary and now serving as the Secretary-General of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. The defendant Yu Wenhua is my secretary, Luo Dunxian is the secretary of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Youth League, and Liao Chengzhi is the secretary of the Communist Party's Seafarers' Union, etc. The three defendants Luo, Yu, and Liao all denied ever joining the Communist Party or holding a position. Liao also stated that he had never met Wang Qiliang and that today was the first time he had ever met him. His statements are all unfounded. At this point, Lawyer Zhan of the Public Security Bureau rose and said that he had consulted with Liao's lawyer, and Lawyer Wu also agreed to transfer Liao to the Public Security Bureau. If the criminal acts cannot be proven, he can be released early to avoid innocent detention for a week. However, Liao heard this and stated that he had no proof of any crime and did not want to be transferred to any party or be detained by the police station. He only requested to be released unconditionally. Lawyer Wu then requested that bail be allowed during the adjourned period to allow him to go out and await summons. The police station lawyer stated that this case was a case of endangering the Republic of China and could be punished with the death penalty in accordance with the law. If bail could be granted, it would be impossible to investigate. Therefore, he expressed his opposition. Judge Yu then ordered all three defendants to be remanded in custody and re-examined on the afternoon of the 31st.</p>

<p>Municipal Council Board Elections</p>
<h3 id="e135">Has Been Able to Restore the Old Practices of the Past <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>British Five American Two Japanese Two</p>
<p>The Continental News reported that the results of this Municipal Council foreign board elections have been able to restore the old practice of five British seats, two American seats, and two Japanese seats. In last year's election, because the Japanese expatriates believed that the American candidate Cana had anti-Japanese behavior, they agreed not to vote, resulting in only one American, Reven, being elected, and the Dane Benson was able to occupy a seat. Now, Reven has been re-elected, and the American lawyer Franklin has also been elected as a member of the board. In addition, Mr. McNoroden and Mr. Harris (of Sun Life Assurance Company), both British nationals, are also new members of the board. The remaining five people are all old members who have been re-elected.</p>

<p>Going to Various Parts of China to Raise Funds</p>
<p>The Old Russian Emigrants Relief Association of Shanghai Announcement: To whom it may concern, Our Association was previously registered by President Popov through Mr. Gless, President of the Russian Emigrants Association, in 1929, and re-registered by President Metzler of the Association in 1932. Furthermore, our Association has also been approved for registration by the Russian Emigrants United Association, which is a legal organization approved for registration by the Kuomintang Chinese government. Its regulations have been submitted to the British Consulate, the American Consulate, and the Shanghai Diplomatic Commissioner's Office for registration. As for our Association's articles of association, they have also been submitted to the French Consulate General for review and registration, and a permit has been issued, which has been issued by the Chief Inspector of Police, allowing us to conduct association affairs in the French Concession of Shanghai. Our Association plans to send personnel with special permits to various parts of China in the coming days to raise donations. We hope that benevolent people will generously donate money, clothing, or food, all of which will greatly benefit the poor and homeless old Russian emigrants. There are many old Russian emigrants in our association who are waiting for relief from hunger and cold. They are all over 60 or 70 years old, and they are all former soldiers or civil servants who have fulfilled their obligations to the community and society. We still hope that all shops, banks, companies, and great philanthropists will take pity on their old age and helplessness and continuously lend a helping hand.

<h3 id="e137">Telegram to Cease Collection of Soybean Cake Tax <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The Chaozhou Native Association in Shanghai sent a telegram to the Guangdong Provincial Government, Finance Department, Shantou Municipal Government, and the Eastern Guangdong Pacification Commissioner's Office, stating: "We recently received a letter from Shantou merchants stating that the Shantou Taili Company secretly requested approval from provincial authorities to undertake the collection of the Shantou soybean cake tax. Previously, Chen Shaowen and others were publicly elected and obtained approval from the Finance Department to abolish the soybean cake tax. Recently, the tax scoundrel Taili Company has resurfaced, taking advantage of the beginning of spring plowing and the urgent need for soybean cake, secretly obtaining approval from the authorities again to establish the Shantou soybean cake tax and strictly enforcing it. There have even been instances of ships carrying soybean cake being forced to pay the tax. Merchants and farmers are horrified. On the one hand, they have contacted the city's residents to petition the Finance Department to abolish it completely. On the other hand, we earnestly request your association's assistance in telegraphing the provincial and Shantou authorities to request a cessation in order to maintain the original plan. The local unrest is becoming increasingly critical. Please request a complete abolition and assistance from your association to telegraph the provincial and Shantou authorities to request a cessation in order to maintain the original plan. The local unrest is becoming increasingly critical. Please request swift assistance, otherwise the consequences are unimaginable, etc. It is humbly submitted that adding taxes and levies is contrary to the previous abolition of all exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies. How can new items be established to burden the people again? Tax scoundrels are solely focused on profit, while the government should maintain its prestige. Soybean cake is a product of our country and not an imported item. Even if it were imported, given the adoption of tariff protection policies, miscellaneous levies should not be added. Moreover, soybean cake is an essential item for fertilizing fields and is related to the people's livelihood. The livelihood of the Chaozhou people has always relied on the Nanyang region. Since the Nanyang economy is sluggish, many overseas Chinese have lost their jobs and returned to the country. Recently, various harsh regulations have been frequently issued by Nanyang countries, such as a sudden increase in personal taxes by several times, with the intention of expelling our overseas Chinese. Our government has failed to devise methods to provide relief, causing those who have already returned to the country to be unable to afford to go again, and those who have not returned to the country will also have no place to stand. The Chaozhou-Shantou economy will be on the verge of bankruptcy. If we exhaust the resources, the consequences will be unimaginable. This matter concerns the people's livelihood and local security. In addition to sending separate telegrams, we urgently request that you report the situation and request an investigation and approval to order the abolition of the soybean cake tax secretly requested by the Shantou Taili Company and immediately telegraph to stop the company's harassment in order to maintain the original plan and save the people's lives. We cannot help but pray sincerely."</p>

<h3 id="e139">Shanghai Water Company Releases Last Year's Business Report <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Net Profit of One Million Three Hundred Forty-One Thousand and Seventy-Five Taels</p>
<p>Full-Year Dividends of 9% for Class A Shares, 7% for Class B Shares, and 8% for Class C Shares Can Be Issued</p>
<p>However, the Company Acknowledges That Users Who Do Not Waste Water May Receive Special Discounts</p>
<p>The Shanghai Water Company of the Public Concession released its business report for last year, stating that the income from users within the concession was 3,537,668 taels, and the surplus was 2,062,933 taels. Compared with the previous year's income of 3,579,496 taels and a surplus of 2,117,910 taels, both showed a slight decrease. After deducting various allocations from this surplus and adding half of the surplus from users outside the concession, the total net profit was 1,341,075 taels. After deducting the interim dividend of 484,116 taels, there was a remaining balance of 856,959 taels. It is now proposed to distribute an interim dividend of 35,000 taels, an annual bonus of 658,276 taels, and allocate 163,683 taels to the dividend reserve fund account. If this plan is approved by the shareholders' annual meeting on April 4, the total annual dividends will be 9% for Class A shares, 7% for Class B shares, and 8% for Class C shares. The net profit from users outside the concession and ships was 60,677 taels, a significant decrease compared to the previous year's net profit of 102,531 taels. This net profit, together with the balance carried over from the previous year, totaled 64,494 taels. It is now proposed to distribute 54,789 taels as dividends for Class A shares and 7,387 taels for Class B shares, with the remaining 2,318 taels carried over to the next year. Since the beginning of last year, water meters have been installed, and the installation is still ongoing. Once the water meters in each area are installed, fees will be calculated according to the water meter readings. However, when the fees calculated by the water meter are far higher than the fees previously calculated according to the rent, and the company also acknowledges that the user is not wasting water, a special discount may be granted with the approval of the Public Works Department. The company is currently negotiating with the Public Works Department to revise the water meter billing levels as a substitute for the special discount method. The company's land, according to the valuation of the Public Works Department, is worth 5,146,339 taels. Last year's expenses on buildings, water pipes, factories, and machinery totaled 1,276,587 taels. Last year, the total water sales volume increased by 0.00015, while the average daily sales volume decreased by 0.000125. Both the filtration plant and the pumping station are able to maintain good condition. The cost of pumping increased slightly compared to the previous year due to rising coal prices. The cost of water output decreased from 50.56 taels per million gallons in the previous year to 47.94 taels due to efforts to economize and the appreciation of the exchange rate. However, the total cost of tap water was 119.16 taels, compared to 116.11 taels in the previous year and 120.20 taels in 1930. The water meter installation project has now been completed in fourteen districts, with ten districts remaining. It is expected that all will be completed by July this year.</p>

<p>Competition Between American Oil and Russian Oil</p>
<h3 id="e141">Price Reduction by Both Companies <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Price Revised to One Dollar and Five Cents Per US Gallon</p>
<p>The Continental Press reports that the price of gasoline from both Asia and Mobil Oil companies was reduced by five cents yesterday (28th), with the price revised to one dollar and five cents per US gallon. The motive is likely due to competition from Soviet Russian gasoline. However, the authorities of both companies currently deny having a price war plan. As for Soviet Russian gasoline, it is currently sold for one dollar. According to a spokesperson for Russian Oil, in the future, its gasoline will still be five cents cheaper per gallon than other brands.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Opening of Longhua Temple <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Longhua Temple, located in the southwest suburbs of this city, is a famous ancient temple in Shanghai. According to legend, it was built during the Chiwu period (238-251 AD) with hundreds of monks and nuns and covering more than one hundred acres of land. It flourished during the Qing Dynasty. The temple has a scripture library and a bronze Buddha from the Han Dynasty, with a seven-story pagoda nearby. When Qian Dajun was in charge of the Shanghai garrison, he chose the temple's western vegetable garden as a park and built a memorial tower for the fallen soldiers of the Thirty-second Army. Therefore, whenever the spring sunshine is bright and the peach blossoms are red and the willows are green, men and women in Shanghai, young and old, help each other and go to visit in an endless stream. However, after several wars, the doors and windows were damaged, the temples were dilapidated, and the monks and nuns were scattered. Last spring, the Xingxiu Hall was also destroyed by fire. Looking up at the Buddha's light, one cannot help but feel the vicissitudes of the past and present. The abbot of the temple, Yuanzhao, is familiar with the customary laws of the annual incense season and specially submitted a request to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters to open the temple and provide proper protection during the incense season. It has now been approved and fully opened the day before yesterday. Liu Lun, the chief of the sixth district and third precinct of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, fearing that there would be too many visitors and that incidents could easily occur, temporarily added a squad of patrol police to maintain order on the spot. The weather was clear the day before yesterday, and the number of visitors from Jiangsu and Zhejiang was very crowded. The traffic on Longhua Road was heavy, and the scene was very lively.</p>
<p>Called by the Municipal Dock Business Office</p>
<h3 id="e143">Citywide Dock Foreman Discussion Meeting <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>On the morning of March 26th at 10:00 AM, the Dock Business Office convened a discussion meeting for dock foremen in the city at the auditorium on the third floor of the Municipal Party Headquarters. A total of one hundred and three people attended. Committee Member Zhang Jianbai presided over the meeting and reported on the purpose of the meeting, stating that the establishment of the office was just beginning, and internal organization would take some time, which is why the meeting was convened so late. It is regrettable that the leaders of each dock have not been able to meet sooner. The office has a major responsibility for the needs of the times, acting as a transitional period, in handling all matters between labor contractors and guiding the organization of labor unions. The foreman is the element closest to the workers. It is hoped that they will cooperate sincerely with the workers to increase the workers' interests and improve the status of the foremen, and so on. Then, Committee Member Zhang Xiaotong gave a speech, stating that he was extremely pleased to meet the leaders of the 90,000 dock workers in Shanghai today. He then put forward four points for the benefit of everyone: (1) The worker and the foreman are closely connected. Do not be incited or alienated by unscrupulous elements, causing conflict and falling into the trap of villains. (2) The office adopts peaceful means to resolve disputes between labor contractors and laborers through consultation, so that neither party suffers a loss. However, if a dispute does occur, you must come to the office and explain the situation honestly, so that there is no misunderstanding. (3) The situation in Northeast China is tense. Japanese imperialism is taking advantage of every opportunity and continuing its aggression. Foremen should pay special attention to the incitement of traitors. (4) Saving the country through aviation is the most important task at present. We should organize a committee and work hard to raise funds. It was then decided that the business office, the dock contractors, the foremen, and the workers would nominate responsible representatives to form an aviation fundraising committee. On the labor side, Wu Yaoting, Peng Desheng, Dong Boping, and Xu Jianye were immediately nominated as aviation fundraising committee members. The other aspects of dockhands and contractors will continue to nominate fundraising committee members.</p>

<h3 id="e144">Proposed Establishment of a Provincial Joint Association <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The nine trade associations of this city, including the tobacco exchange, sauce and wine, sauce garden, local yellow wine, sorghum liquor, restaurant, Shaoxing wine, Fen wine, and dry tobacco industries, have written to the tobacco and alcohol industry associations of Zhenjiang and ten other counties yesterday, seeking opinions on the proposal to reduce the burden of tobacco and alcohol taxes and requesting joint signatures to convene a joint meeting of representatives of the tobacco and alcohol industries of all counties in the province. The letter states: "Regarding the matter of tobacco and alcohol taxes, since the election of committee members was changed in the 21st year, there has been an increase in the proportion of taxes, which has increased the burden and caused disputes. Although mediation has been carried out to quell the disputes, our two industries have suffered deeply. Now that the year is about to expire, our associations are planning to discuss relief methods. The purpose is to make the national tax abundant and to avoid harassment of merchants, to seek a fundamental solution, and to make it a permanent solution. Recently, we have repeatedly received letters from the tobacco and alcohol industry associations of Suqian, Chongming, Yixing, and other counties to discuss the organization of a provincial joint association of the tobacco and alcohol industry. Our associations held the 13th joint meeting on the 27th of this month at the Tobacco Exchange Industry Association at No. 487 Ningbo Road. As the matter concerns the entire province, it is necessary to jointly convene several counties first in order to show prudence. It was decided to send letters to the tobacco and alcohol industry associations of Zhenjiang, Jiangning, Wuxian, Wuxi, Wujin, Changshu, Wujiang, Taixing, Nantong, Taixian, and ten other counties with large tax ratios to seek opinions. After receiving replies, a date will be set to jointly sign and send letters to the tobacco and alcohol industry associations of all counties in the province, nominating responsible representatives to organize a provincial joint association of the tobacco and alcohol industry to jointly discuss and improve methods, so as to relieve suffering and permanently eliminate disputes. This has been unanimously approved. In addition to sending separate letters, this special letter is to inform you. We hope that your association will consider this matter and, if you agree, please reply within one week so that we can determine the date and jointly send a letter to convene a meeting of all counties in order to achieve unity and show prudence. We will be very grateful."</p>
<h3 id="e145">Scheduled Inspection of Cured Meat Products <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Implementation to Begin on April 1st</p>
<p>Collection of Thirty Cents (Mexican Dollars) Per Hundred Jin</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, Public Security Bureau, Finance Bureau, and Health Bureau jointly announced: "Regarding the matter of inspection of meat products entering the city, the implementation has been temporarily postponed due to the issue of jurisdiction, which is still awaiting instructions. The Health Bureau has now received Instruction No. 4816 from the Municipal Government and an Instruction from the Executive Yuan that the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, according to the city government's approved regulations on the inspection of meat products entering the city, will conduct inspections of cured hams and other meat products. It is reported by the city government that the purpose is to crack down on the entry of diseased meat and protect public health. Before the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has established regulations for the domestic sales inspection of goods, it should be temporarily approved to operate in accordance with these regulations. Once the regulations of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce are established and implemented, they should be handled in accordance with the regulations of the ministry to avoid conflicts with the central administrative authority. In addition to notifying the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the city government is hereby ordered to comply with this order and report accordingly. In accordance with this, our bureau has jointly decided to implement the inspection on April 1st, 22nd year of the Republic of China, and to change the inspection fee to only 30 cents (Mexican dollars) per hundred jin, which has been reported to the city government for record. According to the provisions of Article 7 of the regulations, anyone carrying more than one hundred jin of meat products into the city must first purchase a meat product inspection certificate at any tax collection office of the Finance Bureau in order to obtain a certificate for inspection, otherwise they will be punished according to the regulations. If there are any unscrupulous elements who deliberately confuse and attempt to obstruct, they will be seriously investigated and dealt with. In addition to ordering subordinates to investigate at any time, this announcement is hereby made known to all. This announcement is made on the 3rd month of the 22nd year of the Republic of China.

<p>Water Cut Off in Weishui Lane and Other Areas</p>
<h3 id="e147">Water Company Has Sent Plumbers to Restore Water Supply <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Payment Method Still Under Discussion</p>
<p>The Xinsheng News Agency reports that since the British-owned Shanghai Water Company of the Public Concession installed new water meters in the homes within the concession, water prices have suddenly increased several times, even exceeding the rent, which has caused opposition from all walks of life. The landlords, feeling the pinch, have stopped paying water bills. Although various parties have mediated, the difference is too great to be reconciled. The water company, wanting to enforce its authority, forcibly cut off water to the areas with the most water consumption, which provoked resistance from residents. All parties believe that this stalemate is not appropriate and have requested relevant parties to vigorously mediate with the water company and the Public Works Department, and to hold subcommittee meetings to study ways to resolve the water bill dispute. The water company proposed a temporary compromise, that the water bills owed before the end of February be paid in full at 10% of the rent, and that the water pipes cut off by the water company be restored by the company's plumbers. The property owners' association held a temporary members' meeting to discuss the matter. It was generally believed that this method was not satisfactory. However, in order to take care of the convenience of residents, it was temporarily handled according to the above method, but the company was required to restore the water pipes first, and then pay the fees, which could be guaranteed by the Chinese directors. It was not convenient to acknowledge the new payment method starting from March. According to news from the property owners' association, the water company has sent plumbers to restore water to Weishui Lane, Yuanfang Road, Jingyu Lane, and more than ten other areas where water was cut off, and drinking water has been supplied as usual. However, Sanshin Lane on Tangshan Road and Shuncheng Lane on Yangshupu Road have not yet been opened because the owners of Sanshin Lane have not yet contacted the property owners' association, so the water is still cut off. Shuncheng Lane has no need for tap water because it has drilled an artesian well. According to the person in charge of the association, if the water cut off areas want to restore the usual supply of remaining materials, they can contact the association immediately for similar handling. As for the new payment method starting from March, there is no concrete method yet, and the relevant parties are still discussing it. In short, the water bill must be based on the principle that the owner can afford it, so that both parties can reach a fair solution.</p>
<p>Second Special District Prisoners</p>
<h3 id="e148">Deported to Wuhu Yesterday for Imprisonment <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>A Total of Fifty People</p>
<p>Due to the narrowness of the prison in the Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District Local Court and the overcrowding of prisoners, and fearing that the weather would be hot and affect sanitation, the court specially sent many detectives to transport fifty ordinary criminal prisoners from the court to the Municipal Public Security Bureau by car at 3:00 PM yesterday, and then transferred them to the Ningshao Company Wharf in Nanshi to board the Ningshao Wheel to be transported to the Wuhu Court Prison for imprisonment. At that time, Director Wen, in order to be cautious, in addition to ordering the district chief of the first district, Guan Gong, to send inspector Guo Jifen to lead the police to take care of the situation along the way, also sent Liu Junfan, the captain of the first squadron of the police brigade of the bureau, to lead thirty policemen to escort them to Wuhu to prevent accidents.</p>

<p>Shanghai Silk Industry Bank, located at 64 Hankou Road, has reached its second anniversary since its official opening. On the 26th of this month, at 10:00 AM, the second annual general meeting of shareholders was held on the fourth floor of the bank's Silk Industry Building. Present were directors Zhang Dannv, Feng Zhongqing, Jiang Linshu, Lu Zhengbing, Shen Qinzai, Pan Gongzhan, Yu Guozhen, Chen Ziming, Wang Yansong, Pei Yunqing, supervisors Xu Jilong, Cheng Yongliu, Jin Jianqing, and shareholders Wu Zhihao, Tian Xiangru, Ma Shaoquan, Chen Yizhou, Liang Chenlan, Ye Jiaxing, Luo Qinghua, and over a hundred others, representing 2,485 shares and a total of 1,831 votes. The meeting was presided over by Wang Yansong, the chairman of the bank's board of directors, who also reported the purpose of the meeting. He stated briefly that, in accordance with the bank's articles of association and the resolution of the 16th board meeting, the second annual general meeting of shareholders was convened today. The bank's facilities and operations have always adhered to the principles of seeking development in stability and progress in safety, advancing step by step without negligence. This is to fulfill the bank's commitment to serving society and to live up to the expectations of the shareholders, which can be reported to the shareholders today. Next, Zhu Yinong, secretary of the board of directors, reported on the business situation, which was divided into three points: (1) Deposits and loans: The bank has paid special attention to opening credit transactions. The number of customers this year has increased by 170 compared to the previous year. (2) Safe deposit boxes: The latest type of safe deposit boxes were ordered last winter and have been delivered and installed. They will be open for business next month. (3) Warehousing: The bank has established a warehouse at No. 26 South Tutang Road, Suzhou Road, covering an area of 9.5 fen. The upper and lower three floors have been open for business since March. Due to its convenient location and transportation, there are many people storing goods. Finally, supervisor Xu Jilong reported on the accounts. Then, in accordance with the regulations, the second board of supervisors was elected. The results of the ballot count were announced on the spot, with Xu Jilong receiving 1,762 votes, all of whom were elected as the supervisors for this term. Tea and refreshments were then served, and the meeting adjourned. It was already past 1:00 PM.</p>
<p>Singapore</p>
<h3 id="e151">Postage for Letters Has Not Increased <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Slight increase for private postal services</p>
<p>Completely unrelated to the public</p>
<p>The "Zi Lin" newspaper reported that Reuters Singapore reported yesterday that the local Chinese in that port were protesting against the Chinese postal authorities' intention to increase the postage for letters from private postal services to one corner and two and a half points. The reporter inquired with the Shanghai Postal Administration and learned that the Chinese postal authorities still allow private postal services in Guangzhou, Shantou, Xiamen, and other places to collect and send mail to Singapore and other ports with a larger number of overseas Chinese through the post office. However, for letters to other ports, the international postage rate of 2.5 jiao per letter is charged. Only in Singapore is the fee reduced by half for letters handled by private postal services. In the past, when the postage for foreign letters was 1 jiao, letters sent to Singapore by private postal services enjoyed a special right to deduct 5 fen. Later, when the postage for foreign letters increased to 2.5 jiao, this postage should have automatically increased to 1 jiao and 2.5 fen, but in order to be considerate of the merchants' difficulties, it was delayed. Therefore, to this day, letters sent to Singapore by private postal services still pay 5 fen. Conversely, letters sent from Singapore to China have been charged 8 Singapore cents per letter since October of last year, equivalent to 1 jiao and 6 fen in national currency. Therefore, the proposed increase this time is only for the postage paid by private postal services and is unrelated to the public. It will still maintain the right to a half reduction and is lighter than the postage for mail from Singapore to China.</p>
<p>A momentary height of popularity</p>
<h3 id="e152">Aviation Patriotic Amusement Tea Dance <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Movie Queen Hu Die Participates Despite Illness</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai and Pan Gongzhan Give Speeches to Save the Country</p>
<p>Ticket Sales and Donations Totaled Thousands of Dollars</p>
<p>The "Aviation Patriotic Amusement Tea Dance" celebrating Ms. Hu Die's election as Movie Queen was held at the Da Hu Dance Hall from 2:00 PM to 7:00 PM on the 28th. The number of guests attending exceeded thousands, setting a new record for Da Hu and reaching a momentary height of popularity. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>The Splendor of the Performances. The entertainment started with Ms. Xu Xu singing "Selling Flowers," followed by Ms. Zhu Mingqing singing "Ode to Sleep." After that, Ms. Xu Qin芳 sang a solo performance of "Si Lang Visits His Mother," Mr. Chen Gexin sang the Italian songs "Woman's Heart" and "Slave Song," Ms. Xu Lai sang "Night Fragrance," and Mr. Zheng Xiaoqiu and Ms. 君 collaborated on the Peking Opera "Little Shepherd Boy." Ms. Yang Huijun (also known as Xiao Hei Guniang) sang the drum song "The Western Chamber," and finally Ms. Hu Die sang "The Last Sound," which was specially composed for this event. During this time, famous musicians such as Yan Gongshang, Yan Fan, Yan Zhexi, Chen Haibao, Ha Choumin, Li Jingguang, Tan Guangyou, Ren Guang, Jiang Tao, and Yan Li provided music, which was exceptionally wonderful. The dance performances were also very popular. All the stars of Da Hu participated voluntarily, and all the dance fees were donated to aviation for national salvation.</p>
<p>Gifts from All Walks of Life. In addition to the Fortune Tobacco Company giving each guest a Hu Die cigarette and the China and West Pharmacy giving Star Flower perfume, the Yili Soda Company temporarily donated five boxes of Keles fresh orange juice, the President Food Company donated 1,000 bags of Guai Guai Guo, and the Hede Na Company donated 1,000 jars of Three Flowers Snow Cream and 1,000 boxes of face powder.</p>
<p>Speeches by Sponsors. Sponsor Mr. Wang Xiaolai gave a speech, saying that the games people play now can be divided into three types: lying down, sitting, and walking. Lying down games such as opium smoking and prostitution are enough to destroy the country. Sitting games such as gambling are also enough to destroy the country. The walking game is dancing. Everyone knows that I often dance, and I don't need to shy away from it, but my dancing has a purpose. That is to promote domestic clothing. I hope that those in the dance hall will follow my example of wearing cloth clothes. Everyone should never buy foreign goods and practice dancing to save the country. Next, Pan Gongzhan gave a brief speech, followed by a speech by Yan Duhe, which was alert and contained a humorous meaning, and everyone applauded.</p>
<p>Donations on the Spot. Wang Xiaolai initiated a donation on the spot to help aviation save the country. Mr. Wang personally donated 100 yuan as an initiative. Then, Mrs. Pan Gongzhan donated 50 yuan, Ms. Hu Die donated 50 yuan, and Mr. Yan Duhe donated 20 yuan. Ms. Hu Die personally solicited donations from the guests. In total, about 300 yuan was raised, which, together with the ticket sales, totaled about 1,500 yuan.</p>
<p>Elementary School Students Save the Country. In addition, there is one thing worth recording. An eight-year-old elementary school student studying at Wan Bamboo Elementary School brought a letter to Feng Mengyun, a member of the organizing committee of the conference, and carried a piggy bank containing more than two yuan, which he used to buy a ticket, expressing his support for aviation to save the country. The conference introduced him to the guests and took a photo to commemorate the occasion.</p>
<p>Former Songhu Police Department</p>
<h3 id="e153">Dispute Over Loan Owed to Guangdong Bank <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Loan Delayed for a Long Time and Not Repaid</p>
<p>Guarantors Xu Qianlin and Others Sued</p>
<p>Shanghai gentry and merchants Xu Qianlin and Wang Binyan were recently sued by lawyer Yan, representing Guangdong Bank, in the First Special District District Court for defaulting on a loan. It is alleged that the defendants borrowed 5,000 Shanghai taels from the bank on April 20th of the Republic of China Year 14, with an agreement to repay the loan three months later. The interest was calculated at a rate of 10 taels per 100 taels per annum. Accumulating until the previous month, the outstanding interest had reached 7,506 taels and 8 qian. Combining the principal and interest, the total debt was 12,506 taels and 8 qian. Despite repeated reminders, the defendants have been making excuses for delay. Therefore, the lawsuit was filed, requesting a judgment ordering the full repayment of the principal and interest. After being sued, Xu and others also hired lawyer Zhao Chuanding to file a defense, stating that at the time of the loan, the provincial treasury was empty after the Qi-Lu war, and the Songhu police salaries were in default, endangering local security. The former Magistrate Li of Shanghai County and the former Director Chang of the Songhu Police Department raised funds from the Chamber of Commerce. Chen Bingqian introduced the Police Department to borrow 5,000 taels of silver from Guangdong Bank, and the two defendants were asked to act as guarantors. A promissory note was written and given to the bank. The note clearly stated that the defendants were only guarantors and that there was an agreement to repay the loan. This can be verified by records in the municipal government and the Public Security Bureau, and is also evidenced by the plaintiff's letters. Now, the plaintiff's claim in the lawsuit that the defendants borrowed the money is a lie. Although the debt has not been repaid, the principal debtor is actually the Municipal Public Security Bureau. On February 16th of this year, the plaintiff commissioned lawyer Mi to write a letter requesting the defendants to fulfill their guarantee obligations. The defendants explained that since the Municipal Public Security Bureau had succeeded the Police Department in inheriting the debt, the plaintiff's claim should be made against the Municipal Public Security Bureau. It is unreasonable to abandon the principal debtor and directly demand payment from the defendants, who are only guarantors. Later, the plaintiff's lawyer wrote again, stating that the municipal government seemed unwilling to take responsibility, so the defendants were asked to repay on their behalf. The defendants checked the Public Security Bureau's letter, which clearly instructed the plaintiff on how to seek payment and did not indicate any intention to default. The plaintiff insisted that the Municipal Public Security Bureau was evading responsibility, which was close to insulting the administrative authorities and was truly unreasonable. Now, the plaintiff has listed the defendants as defendants, accusing them of borrowing money and failing to repay, and has directly filed a lawsuit. According to the law, the liability of a guarantor is subordinate and clearly stipulates that the guarantor shall perform the obligation on behalf of the principal debtor if the principal debtor fails to perform the obligation. This is the first characteristic of a guarantee debt. There is also a supplementary nature, that is, to supplement the performance of the principal debt, and the performance of the principal debtor should be the priority. The creditor is not allowed to request performance directly from the guarantor before the principal debtor. This is the second characteristic of a guarantee debt. Therefore, the guarantor has the right to demand investigation and the right to prior litigation. In this case, the principal debtor is the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the defendants are only guarantors, which is an indisputable fact. The Municipal Public Security Bureau has neither denied the debt nor expressed any intention of not performing it. It has also stated that the matter is real and has been submitted to the higher authorities for verification. The reason for the non-payment is simply that no instructions have been received. This is an administrative procedure. How can it be said that the city is deliberately evading responsibility? The plaintiff did not quietly await the disposition of the municipal government, nor did it apply to the municipal government as instructed by the Public Security Bureau. Instead, it insulted the authorities, making wild claims that the Municipal Public Security Bureau was deliberately evading responsibility and unwilling to take responsibility. It has directly filed a lawsuit against the defendants before the principal debtor. According to the law, there is no reason for this. It is requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. Yesterday morning, Judge Yang Peng held a hearing. Because the facts of the loan were not disputed, the hearing was concluded immediately after the examination. However, the two sides had different opinions on the issue of responsibility. The lawyers on both sides debated this point for a long time. After the two sides concluded their arguments, Judge Yang ordered that a date be set for the verdict.</p>
<p>Lin Xuehuai</p>
<h3 id="e154">Extension Granted for Debt Owed to Hu Die <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The termination of the engagement between Xue Die was determined early. However, because Lin Xuehuai had not fulfilled his debt to Hu Die for a long time, Hu filed a request for execution. Lin, upon hearing of this in Suzhou, immediately returned to Shanghai to settle the matter. Lin has now repaid a portion of the debt, totaling 300 yuan, and has requested that the remainder be paid in installments monthly. However, Hu has not fully agreed. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, the execution judge of the First Special District District Court continued to hold a hearing. The plaintiff's lawyers, Zhan Jifeng and Zhan Yigang, represented Hu and stated that they had received 300 yuan and that the rest could be granted an extension of one month. The defendant was also represented by lawyer E Sen, who stated the reason for the installment payment. The court then granted the extension.</p>
<p>Xianshi Grand Theater</p>
<h3 id="e155">The Crimes of Extra Actor Wang Monk <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Two Boys Brutally Abused</p>
<p>How Is This Behavior Different from That of Beasts?</p>
<p>Wang Monk, a local extra actor in the Xianshi Amusement Park Grand Theater on Jing Road, has always been vulgar, committing crimes and offenses more than once. Although he has been punished, he has not repented. Abusing young children is his most prominent crime. Previously, Sun Yunyu, a 16-year-old boy from Suzhou, originally worked on a ship. At the end of last year, he lost his job for some reason and was stranded in Shanghai. In January of this year, Wang saw him passing through the Hongkou area. Because he was young and easy to deceive, Wang used enticement. The boy had no money to return home, so he spent his days with Wang. Wang pretended to be his apprentice and spent the nights with him. From then on, he was forcibly sodomized every night. The boy suffered greatly and tried to escape twice, but Wang had many followers and many eyes and ears. He was always found and returned, and the surveillance was even stricter. On the 21st of this month, Yang Yuyu, a 17-year-old boy from Zhenjiang, came to Shanghai from his hometown to visit his mother and brother. He was also seen by Wang while passing through Xizang Road. Wang learned that the boy had not found his relatives, so he used his deceptive skills, saying that he would recommend him to work at Xianshi Company, where he could earn 7 jiao a day. The boy believed him. Wang then took him to a bathhouse, had him wash his whole body, and took him to the Xinyuelai Inn on Wuhu Road at night. He did to Yang what he had done to Sun, also pretending to be his apprentice, and taught him various slang terms popular in the underworld. The boy could not bear the abuse and wanted to escape, but there was no opportunity. Five days ago, Wang took Sun out, resulting in a lapse in security. Yang finally escaped from the tiger's mouth and was found by a detective, who took him to the Laozha Police Station and transferred him to the hospital. An examination revealed that the anus had been injured by sodomy. The police chief then sent detectives Geng Debiao and Ma Mouxiang to arrest Wang Monk and Sun. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special District District Court. Presiding Judge Feng Shide held a hearing. Police lawyer Ru Baozhen stated that the case was related to public morals and requested that the hearing be closed to the public. The court approved the request. Then, he stated the various obscene acts committed by the defendant in abusing the boys and requested that the defendant be severely punished. Finally, he stated that Sun had not yet been examined by a doctor and requested that the case be adjourned for further investigation. Then, Yang and Sun testified in turn about the abuse they had suffered. When Wang Monk was questioned, he only admitted to taking the two boys as apprentices and denied everything else. Judge Feng then ordered the defendant to be detained. Yang and Sun were temporarily sent to the Women and Children's Relief Association. The case was adjourned for seven days for further investigation.</p>

<p>Spending Money Wildly in a Hotel</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Jiang Sued Together</p>
<p>Dai Mingguan, a Ningbo native residing at No. 46 and a half Yuanhe Lane, Yuanfang Road, Hongkou, reported to the Second District First Office yesterday that his daughter, Dai Caixin, 20 years old, had been betrothed to Li Xizhang, a car driver in the Gordon Road Police Department. But his daughter was enamored with freedom and ran away from home. After a few days, a letter came from the China Children's Welfare Association on Bowuyuan Road, stating that the daughter was staying in the association and was arguing for freedom with her parents. He went to the association to meet with staff member Wang Yiguan, but Wang always dealt with him in a humorous manner and did not allow him to see his daughter. After further investigation, his brother Dai Xiaguan found out that his daughter and Mr. and Mrs. Jiang Zhuoying, residing at No. 2 Chunhua Lane, Jiumudi, were in Room 626 of the Da Hu Hotel, spending money wildly day and night. It was obvious that they were ruining the family reputation and taking the opportunity to harm public morals. He requested an investigation. He was instructed to arrest Mr. and Mrs. Jiang and Dai Caixin and present them to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. Because the case involved the abduction of a woman under the age of 20, they were immediately escorted to the District Court for interrogation.</p>

<p>丨Boat Crew Members Drift Away with the Waves丨</p>
<p>The Tongyihe Liquor Boat from South City was sailing from north to south after loading liquor cargo at the Sampan Factory at 3:00 AM yesterday morning. When passing the Taikoo Wharf, the company's Poyang Wheel left the port and sailed north without sounding its horn, proceeding northward. The liquor boat was unable to avoid it in time and was overturned by the wheel. The liquor it was carrying was completely poured into the Huangpu River. Of the three crew members, only two were rescued. One of them, Zhu Er, was swept away by the waves and died. The firm and the families of the boat owner and crew members believe that the Poyang Wheel neglected its duties, resulting in a major loss of life and cargo. They have reported the facts to the Jianghai Customs Water Patrol Team, requesting a fair investigation, and have also sent letters to fellow villagers' associations in Pudong and Shaoxing, requesting assistance.</p>

<p>丨Hiding the Property Ledger丨</p>
<p>Chai Yanxu, son of the deceased Suzhou tycoon Chai Bingsheng, was entrusted by his relatives Pan Xiangsen and Ji Zhongren to keep a large number of precious ornaments left by his late mother for thirteen years. He repeatedly demanded their return without success. As a last resort, he hired lawyers Jiang Yiping, Qin Liankui, and Yang Zhihao to file a criminal complaint in the First Special Court, accusing them of embezzlement, etc. After repeated hearings, the court ordered Lou Mingshi, an important witness for the defendants, to appear in court for further questioning. Yesterday (the 28th) afternoon, Judge Zhan Liangce continued the hearing. The witness summoned for the plaintiff appeared, but none of the defendants appeared for various reasons. The plaintiff, Chai Yanxu, stated that the ornaments were deposited by the defendants in their personal names in the safe deposit box of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank. All transactions were handled by the defendants. On February 4th of the 14th year, he and his wife accompanied Pan Disheng, son of Pan Xiangsen, to the bank to retrieve the items. At that time, a property ledger was found. They took this ledger to the Hainemann's foreign firm to consult with his brother-in-law, Wu Langxi. Wu copied a list from the ledger. Then, Pan Disheng wrote the words "Di Dui" (checked by Di) on the ledger. The original ledger was still taken away by Pan Disheng. Later, Wu transcribed the list into another ledger. He only needs to ask the defendants to hand over the original ledger and ask Zhao Jieting to testify that Mr. and Mrs. Chai and Pan Disheng visited Wu Langxi at Hainemann's firm. Because Pan and Chai were arguing, Wu advised them and copied a list from the ledger, and the original ledger was taken away by Pan. According to Chai's statement, a small part of the ornaments deposited by the defendants was retrieved on the 25th day of the twelfth lunar month in the Bingyin year, but the majority of them have not been returned despite repeated requests. When questioned, the defendant Pan Xiangsen firmly stated that all the ornaments had been returned in full. At that time, only a list of ornaments was recorded, and there was no so-called ledger. After further questioning, Pan Xiangsen claimed to have sold 2,000 taels of pearls and 100 yuan. Because the important witness Lou Mingshi (the person who wrote the original property ledger) arrived, the wives of Pan Xiangsen and Zhang Zhenhou were summoned for questioning. Therefore, the hearing was adjourned to April 11th for further investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e159">Fire at Yifengxiang Hotel <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>The Yifengxiang Hotel at No. 57, the street behind the Tongchun Inn in Old Baidu, Pudong, suddenly caught fire at 1:00 AM yesterday morning. Because it was midnight, no one noticed it for a while. The owner, Li Qing, was awakened in his sleep and urgently woke up his family and staff, and they all escaped through the back door, avoiding disaster. Before long, the fire broke through the roof. A nearby guard noticed it and urgently sounded an alarm whistle for assistance. The surrounding neighbors were all awakened and fled outwards. The fire became more and more intense and soon spread to the double-frontage Tongxin Chang Cigarette and Paper Shop at Nos. 59 and 61 next door. The shop was full of flammable items such as paper, candles, and kerosene, so the flames were fueled and became even more intense. The Tongchun Fu's private fire engine was driven out to draw water for firefighting. Because the fire was raging, it was difficult to extinguish it for a while. By 3:00 AM, it had also destroyed a tiger stove before gradually being extinguished. However, the embers inside the fire site were still smoldering until dawn. When the fire was raging, Yang Zhongquan, the director of the Third District First Branch, and Inspector Sun led the police to maintain order around the fire site, so no incidents occurred. Afterwards, the fire station took the hotel owner Li Fuqing, a native of Suqian, and the Tongxin Chang shop owner Mingchang, a native of Ningbo (insured), along with the witness Zhang Atao, to the station for separate interrogation. It was decided to send Li and Chen to the headquarters for further investigation. The witness Zhang Atao was temporarily released on bail pending summons.</p>

<p>At around 9:00 AM yesterday morning, at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Baker Road in the Public Concession, a nearby child named Zhu Deyuan, nine years old, was wandering in the road. He suddenly tried to cross the road. A British military vehicle, identified as No. 9888, was coming towards him. He was unable to avoid it in time and was knocked to the ground, breaking his ribs and injuring his head. He was on the verge of death. After hearing the news, Chinese police officer No. 732 rushed to the scene, recorded the vehicle number, and immediately sent the injured child to Renji Hospital. Due to the severity of his injuries, he died at 6:15 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Endless Illegal Gambling Syndicates <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Double Gold Company Busted</p>
<p>The major illegal gambling syndicates in this city, originally divided into North and South factories, were merged into one factory on March 1st of this year. As a result, the gambling outlets in the lanes of both the Chinese and foreign concessions are visible everywhere. Gambling is even more prevalent than before. Three rounds are run per day. Each round brings in around 40,000 to 50,000 yuan for the major factories. Every day at 2:00 PM, 7:30 PM, and 2:00 AM in the middle of the night, the report-carrying bicycles (called "fast horses" by these people) on the various roads are constantly on the move. A person named Shuangqing has more than ten gambling outlets in the Baoyu Lane and Xinchang Lane of the French Concession. He has considerable power among the gambling gangs. The gambling outlet's signboard is the Double Gold Company, divided into East, West, North, and South. Each outlet brings in thousands of yuan. At around 7:00 PM yesterday evening, the head of the Da Zi Ming Zhong Police Station in the French Concession sent more than ten Chinese and French detectives, including Vietnamese police officers, to secretly raid the Double Gold Company gambling outlet at No. 41 Baoyu Lane. At that time, gamblers were gathered there, and more than ten people were arrested, along with three wooden boxes of gambling slips. They were taken to the police station and reported to the head of the police for verification.</p>
<h3 id="e162">A Kidnapping Case Was Uncovered on the Yushun Steamer <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Each Child's Testimony Confirmed, Kidnappers Also Sixteen or Seventeen Years Old</p>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's Yushun Steamer, which travels between Fuzhou, Xiamen, and other ports, left its berth in Shanghai at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Prior to this, Qiao Songren, the South Wharf Patrol Chief of the Bureau, inspected the ship at around 2:00 PM. While inspecting the large cabin, he heard the sounds of children. He immediately conducted a search and found four kidnapped boys and one kidnapper in the large cabin. He immediately inquired about them in secret. There were two accomplices in the passenger cabin. He immediately took the arrested kidnapper to identify and capture them. All three kidnappers were arrested without a single one escaping. Patrol Chief Qiao then interrogated them separately. According to Gu Yongzhen, the eldest of the kidnapped boys, 17 years old and from Hangzhou, he was kidnapped by the kidnapper Chen Afa (the one currently arrested) at the age of 13 and sold to the Fuda Automobile Company. Because he had suffered for many years and had no money, he finally escaped to Shanghai this year. Unexpectedly, he met Chen Afa on Fourth Horse Road and was dragged back again. This is the second time he has been kidnapped. According to the boy Weng Xiaomao, 14 years old and from Hangzhou, he was kidnapped by Wang Jinqing and Chen Afa on Fourth Horse Road and did not know where he was being taken. According to the boy Yang Axiang, from Hangzhou, 13 years old, he lived in Caoqiaomen. According to the boy Yao Abao, from Suzhou, his father's name was A Qiao, a tailor. He was kidnapped by Wang Jinfa at the entrance of the Great World while making clothes in Mingde Lane in the British Concession. According to the kidnapper Wang Jinfa, 17 years old and from Nanjing, he planted flowers in the Zhongshan Garden in Xiamen. He had done it once before. In November of last year, Chen Afa kidnapped a boy, 15 years old, on Minguo Road and took him to Guangdong. According to the kidnapper Chen Afa, he made toothpaste in Pudong. The kidnapper Wang Chunfa, 16 years old and from Hangzhou, gave cunning statements. Patrol Chief Qiao, with solid evidence, immediately escorted all the people and witnesses to the Water Patrol Police Station to be sent to court for severe punishment.</p>

<p>On the morning of December 16th of last year, at 8:30 AM, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters sent driver Chen Yongde to drive car No. 6157 to Rongren Lane on Xujiahui Road in the French Concession, Xieqiao, to pick up an official to go to the headquarters to work. When Chen's car turned around at the entrance of Rongren Lane, its head collided with Yu Jiaming, a rickshaw puller from Haimen, who was parked on the side of the road, causing injuries to his head, waist, left leg, and other places. He fell to the ground. A police officer recorded the number and reported it to the police station. The injured person was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment, but he did not recover. Yu's wife, Gu, filed a criminal complaint in the Second Special Court, accusing the driver Chen Yongde of causing injury. The case had not yet been concluded when Yu died in the hospital due to the severity of his injuries. The hospital notified the police station's vehicle department to send the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home for an autopsy. Yesterday, the Second Special Court requested Prosecutor Deng to come to the funeral home to confirm that the deceased had died from injuries sustained in a car accident. The body was ordered to be claimed by the family. The defendant was sent to the case by the vehicle department for interrogation.</p>

<h3 id="e167">Letter to the Editor <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Back in July of the 12th year of the Republic of China [1923], when I was working as a section chief at the Jiangsu Bureau of Foreign Affairs, 160 yuan was deducted from my salary as part of a fund to redeem the Jiaoji Railway. The negotiator, Mr. Xu, sent the sum to the Songhu Military Governor's Office for storage. Subsequently, a letter was received from the Military Governor proposing that the funds be used to purchase government bonds, to be deposited in the Yanyeh, Dalu, and Jitong banks, with interest at 8% every six months, pending central government negotiations and the announcement of concrete measures to exchange for Jiaoji Railway shares. I have a receipt with the Foreign Affairs Bureau's third seal as proof. Ten years have passed, and there has been no announcement as to whether this sum has been used to redeem the railway or remains deposited in the bank. Having read in the newspaper that the former Songhu Military Governor, He Fenglin, is in Shanghai raising funds for the World Red Cross Society, I yesterday sent a letter to the Shanghai Office of the World Red Cross Society, offering to donate the deducted 160 yuan in full to the society, requesting that they contact Mr. He. Considering that dozens of colleagues from the former Foreign Affairs Bureau had salary deductions, amounting to a significant sum, I propose that all colleagues donate these funds to the Red Cross Society or the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army Support Association, to prevent public funds from being lost. I hope this sentiment can be shared. As colleagues are scattered in all directions, it is difficult to convene a meeting to discuss. I respectfully request that your publication, recognizing the good cause involved, publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" column so that everyone may be informed. Thank you.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Shang Shengbo, March 26th.</p>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Having read in your newspaper on the 29th of this month the news regarding the laid-off employees of the two railways petitioning the Party and government authorities, the three demands listed are accurate. However, regarding the statement that "since Huang Boqiao took office, he has strived to reorganize, repay foreign debts, and drastically reduce redundant staff," this does not align with the facts. We do not know what your newspaper's basis for this is: (1) Since Mr. Huang took office, there has been no reorganization; (2) The repayment of foreign debt is the implementation of a previous plan from October 1st of last year, where 10% of daily revenue is deposited into HSBC, to be allocated when a sufficient amount is accumulated; this was handled by the previous administration; (3) The staff and officers of all levels laid off by Mr. Huang this time all had actual work and were not redundant staff. Currently, we and our colleagues are in discussions with Mr. Huang based on the facts. We especially request that you publish this correction in the "Letters to the Editor" column so that society may understand the truth and avoid misunderstandings. We earnestly hope for this.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>The Laid-Off Employees of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, March 29th.</p>

<p>| Letter from Zhu Yingjun of Shanghai |</p>
<p>I have read Mr. Wang Muchong's letter of the 13th. He says his wife "cannot read, does not understand human relationships, and is ignorant of world affairs." In a nutshell, he is saying that his wife has no knowledge. Here I want to ask: What is knowledge? Is reading tens of thousands of books and obtaining a doctorate degree while being someone who does not work to eat considered knowledge? Conversely, even if one cannot read and does not have a doctorate or bachelor's degree, but does work that benefits the group every day, at least not being a parasite on society, is this considered true knowledge? Having clarified this point, I will discuss Mr. Wang's wife. Mr. Wang's wife is clearly what people call an old-fashioned woman. However, old-fashioned women can cook, wash clothes, help with all household tasks, and raise children, allowing their husbands to focus on the work they should be doing. Is this beneficial to society? Naturally, I am not saying that women should only do these things, but in any case, it is ten thousand times better than those modern women who only care about applying makeup, going to the movies, and going to dance halls. Although there are some women with true knowledge, in the current China, "heroes have no place to use their talents," and knowledge is merely an ornament for them, while in reality, they are nothing more than parasites on society. It is better to be like Mr. Wang's wife, who, although she does not have much knowledge (according to Mr. Wang's view), can do some practical work for society little by little. Furthermore, Mr. Wang says: "Originally, my family was not very well-off, but her family is rich." He also says: "Her temperament is very gentle, she is very humble and modest towards me, and not arrogant..." From this, it seems that Mr. Wang's wife is a woman of very good character. Although she comes from a wealthy family, she has the awareness of those who are not wealthy. If properly trained, it would not be difficult for her to become a vanguard in reforming society. In fact, there are already many women like this. Mr. Wang is probably a college student. College students have a responsibility to reform society. You must know that in order to reform society, you must first sacrifice yourself and at the same time uplift the weak in society. Even if Mr. Wang considers his marriage unsatisfactory, he must act based on this principle. In other words, it is acceptable to tolerate one's wife having little knowledge, while at the same time diligently teaching her to gain knowledge. This is the correct way. Otherwise, how can you brag and say, "I will do things for society in the future, I am an outstanding member of society," if it is not just empty talk!</p>
<p>This letter is only a supplement from the reporter.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Regarding Mr. Wang Muchong's letter, this column has already provided a detailed response (see the 13th issue of this column). Now that we have received Mr. Zhu's letter, which supplements what the reporter's response lacked, we are publishing it above.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Issues of Opening a Store and Borrowing Money <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>| Letter from Qu Wenshou of Shanghai |</p>
<p>Editor: Every day I read the "Reader Advisory" section, which answers readers' common questions from a scientific and materialist standpoint. I sincerely and courageously appreciate and accept them. Therefore, my addiction to reading your column is more important and emphasized than reading the news or literary columns in the entire newspaper! For this reason, in the Chinese language test for the news correspondence school run by your newspaper, in the essay question "Criticism and suggestions for this newspaper," I especially praised your column and criticized it, but I have not received a response. Now, I am raising two important and serious questions in the title above. Please disclose them in your newspaper! The first question is about the following: Through the introduction of relatives and friends, I entered this store as a worker selling goods and keeping accounts. It has only been eight months, but the hierarchy is very strict, especially the so-called proprietress, who is like a supervisory committee member and the most vicious woman's heart. The proprietress handles and monitors the store's trivial matters. Every day, the boss treats the employees with a stern face, which, as those who have experienced such an environment know, is no less severe than a judge treating a prisoner. The young master and the proprietress are no exception. In our ×× store, a so-called husband-and-wife shop, I live and work under their constant ridicule. Therefore, the mutual antipathy has been built up so high that it seems to resemble a pyramid, as deep as a flowing spring! For this reason, we are now gathering several colleagues from the store, preparing to leave this cage, and gathering shares to start our own new store in Shanghai, the same type of business. In business, we will inevitably be envied by the old boss who is about to be abandoned. Currently, we (the colleagues) are preparing to resign from the boss en masse. Does this, if the boss deems me as the initiator, involve legal issues? The second question is a question that arises from the first question: Borrowing money. In Shanghai, I have a wealthy relative who owns dozens of city houses, and I collect rent for him. In the past, because some of our fellow villagers borrowed money from him and did not repay it, he views my credit (borrowing money) as being of the same kind. It is difficult to get his approval to borrow. So, now that I am collecting rent for him and handling more than a thousand yuan in cash every month, I am thinking of secretly appropriating three hundred yuan from the rent money (as start-up capital for the store) when he does not allow me to borrow in person. Then, I will tell him about it as a plan for forced borrowing. At this time, the relationship between the two parties will be broken, but what about the legal issues?</p>
<p>Answer: You previously "especially praised and criticized this column" in the essay for the recruitment examination for the news correspondence school run by this newspaper. We are truly ashamed to hear this praise, because our colleagues have limited knowledge and cultivation, and we are always afraid that we will not be able to meet the earnest expectations of the readers. We sincerely accept this criticism. To what extent the readers' criticism is genuine also shows to what extent our small efforts have gained the attention of the readers. Moreover, we not only want to be advisors to the readers, but also hope that readers will provide us with real materials from social life. This is a digression. Now, let us answer the two questions you raised as follows: If you and your colleagues form a new store together, if the procedures are clear and the separation is proper, it may not involve legal issues. But this does not mean that your boss will not sabotage it. Sabotage is of course unavoidable, but as long as your group is solid, it will not matter. However, I think there is a bit of self-contradiction in your matter. You yourselves have awakened to the conflict of interests due to the abuse of the old boss and the proprietress, but you must know that the relationship of conflict of interests is formed by the entire social organization and the entire economic system. To solve this problem, you must think from the perspective of the entire society and start with a great mass organization to have a solution. If everyone leaves the old boss's power and becomes the boss themselves, in this old-fashioned society, if you become the boss, what method will you use not to be harsh on people? Do you have any ideal plans? May I ask? This is the first question. You can borrow money from people, but if you "secretly appropriate" and "forcefully borrow," it can easily affect the feelings of both parties, or even lead to legal problems, or even fatally damage your newly opened business. In our opinion, there is something wrong with what you are doing. If you insist on doing it your own way, you will definitely fail. Be careful! This is the second question.</p>

<p>Recent News on Inspection of Anhui Education</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education previously sent Guo Xincong, Chen Kezhong, and Tang Xifen to inspect Anhui Provincial University and general education. The inspectors have returned to Beijing one after another. The inspection reports are currently being compiled jointly. It is reported that Guo and Chen inspected Anhui University, the Anqing Provincial Women's Middle School, the Provincial First Middle School, three vocational schools, and the Provincial Library. In addition to the men's and women's middle schools and vocational schools in Anqing, they also inspected primary and secondary schools in other locations. When inspecting the university and the schools in the provincial capital, Education Commissioner Zhu Tinghu accompanied them. The Anhui University campus is rented, with monthly rent payments of several hundred yuan. The university has identified a new campus with a large area, but due to the national crisis, construction funds have not yet been received, so construction has not begun. The university is divided into the Colleges of Arts, Sciences, and Law, with a larger number of law students. Each department has a large number of professors, and the facilities are good. Teachers' salaries are paid in full, while staff salaries are paid at 80%. The middle schools and vocational schools are operating with good spirit and have decent facilities. The library's collection is mainly Chinese books, with a slight lack of books for specialized academic research.</p>

<p>Simultaneous Opening of the Engineering Hall and Completion of the Rong Hong Hall</p>
<p>More Than 230 Chinese and Foreign Businesses Participating</p>
<p>Ten-Day Exhibition, Media Preview Held Yesterday</p>
<p>The Industrial and Railway Exhibition of Jiaotong University is scheduled to open this morning at 10:00 AM in the Wen Zhi Hall. Simultaneously, the opening and completion ceremony of the Engineering Hall and Rong Hong Hall will also be held. The exhibition will last for ten days, until April 8th. The exhibition is divided into four sections: engineering, railways, roads and markets, and the university's achievements. The arrangements were completed yesterday. At noon, a reception was held on the second floor of Rong Hong Hall for members of the city's press. President Li Zhaohuan and faculty member Xu Mingcai of the university gave reports and guided the press to visit each section. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Reception Report: The Jiaotong University Industrial and Railway Exhibition reception for the city's press was attended by more than 40 reporters from Chinese and foreign newspapers. First, Xu Mingcai, the director of publicity for the exhibition, reported, briefly stating: The university's Industrial and Railway Exhibition is now ready. We have specially invited the press to visit. We are very pleased that you have graciously come. We hope you will not hesitate to offer your guidance so that we can improve. There are about three points regarding today's reception, which I will briefly report: (1) Running a school and running a news organization share the responsibility of educating society and are closely related. However, due to the heavy workload of education, there are few opportunities to interact. We are taking advantage of the opening of the exhibition to meet with you, and we will work even harder together in the future. (2) Exhibitions are held dozens of times a year in major cities in Europe and the United States. The purpose is to make the public interested in industrial construction and then engage in research and invention. When the university celebrated its 30th anniversary, it also held an exhibition. At that time, few domestic manufacturers participated, but the purpose was also to make the Chinese people aware of the situation of industrial and railway construction and arouse their interest. This time, more domestic factories are participating, and it can also be used to introduce the achievements of the Chinese people's efforts in industry over the past seven years. (3) All the preparations and arrangements for this exhibition were done in spare time. Due to the short time, there may be some imperfections, so we have invited you to come and visit first, hoping to receive your guidance. Then, President Li Zhaohuan reported on the significance of holding the Industrial and Railway Exhibition, briefly stating: China has been oppressed by the great powers in recent years and has advocated resistance, but because there has been little preparation, it has ultimately failed. The university also held an exhibition seven years ago, which mostly displayed foreign products. Outsiders did not understand and thought it was promoting foreign goods and advertising for foreign businesses. In fact, China's lack of preparation lies in the backwardness of its industry, and the underdevelopment of industry lies in the fact that the Chinese people are not interested in industry. Therefore, the significance of the exhibition is to make the Chinese people aware of industrial construction, and various discussion sessions will be held, but they will not be publicized because they are related to national defense.</p>
<p>Exhibition Participants: The deadline for Chinese and foreign manufacturers participating in the exhibition was last night. There are more than 230 in total. (1) Industrial Exhibition: The machines on display include those from Laina Printing Machinery Manufacturing Factory, Xintong Trading Company, Kailuo Mining Bureau, Zhendan Iron Factory, Puda Steel Factory, Anli Foreign Company, Wantai Company, Chanshen Foreign Company, Tongji University Factory, Mona Printing Machinery Manufacturing Factory, Li Chang Foreign Company, Gong Chang Iron Factory, China Wireless Research Society, Academia Sinica, Copper and Iron Testing Ground, Weichang Foreign Company, Ford Motor Company, Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Plant, etc. (2) Railway Exhibition: The displayed trains, rails, and various documents include those from Pinghan, Beining, Daoqing, Pingsui, Longhai, Xiang'e, Nanxun, Jiaoji, Jinghu, Huhangyong, Jinpu, Guangshao, Hangjiang, Zhengtai, Zhushao railways, and the Ministry of Railways. (3) The school's achievements are displayed, including maps of Jiaotong University, new planned buildings, old maps of Nanyang University, and past achievements. (4) Road and Market Exhibition: Includes highway maps of various provinces and cities, public displays of car models, a map of Greater Shanghai, models of the municipal government and various bureaus in the city center. The displays are numerous and cannot be fully listed.</p>
<p>Opening Today: The association will hold the opening ceremony at 10:00 this morning, officiated by Gu Mengyu, Minister of Railways.

<p>General Assembly Declaration: The university is honored by your visit to the Industrial and Railway Exhibition. The initiation of this event was originally intended to commemorate the 35th anniversary of the university's founding. The Shanghai Incident suddenly occurred, and the progress was interrupted. This time, in order to maintain external credibility, the event continues. Preparation was only half done when the incident occurred again. Fortunately, with the special permission of the government, it can be opened on schedule. Efforts for construction should not be changed due to the situation, and the Chinese people should take the opportunity to make a vigorous effort to strengthen themselves after the deep pain of this creation. For plans that can use science to promote development, we must go all out. The university has a related responsibility and dare not abandon its inherent duty. The purpose of this event is to arouse the interest of the Chinese people in engineering and railway undertakings, so as to promote the progress of technology and management methods. At the same time, it can assist the development of industry and commerce, promote the effectiveness of education, connect international feelings, and encourage the spirit of creation. This intention should be understood by everyone. The scale is small, the collection is not complete, but the classification and arrangement are colorful, which is enough to inspire everyone's interest in visiting. We express our warm welcome to all the guests, and with a single thought of the difficult times, we have to encourage everyone to be vigilant in times of adversity. Today, a strong enemy is pressing on the border, and the people's livelihood is poor. The soldiers on the front line are fighting hard in the rain of bullets, and the compatriots in the Northeast are also displaced. We who are fortunate enough to live in peace and work, what should we think about it? We deeply hope that after your visit, you will feel the weight of the national responsibility and make plans for disaster relief and defense according to your financial and intellectual capabilities, so that the foundation of the country can be consolidated and the recovery can be hoped for. This exhibition is limited to engineering and railways. Military supplies that destroy peace have not been included, and decorations that induce luxury have not participated. What is on display is mostly the sharp weapon of production or the necessities of transportation. They are all related to construction issues to some extent. If you observe, compare the advantages and disadvantages, and learn from each other,</p>

<p>arouse the idea of ​​improvement and promote the great cause of creation, then this meeting's contribution to China's construction undertakings will be of considerable value. Furthermore, the rapid advancement of modern material civilization is due to the application of science. That is to say, all the exhibits at this meeting are the crystallization of science. Our country's industry is underdeveloped, and production is lagging behind. Looking at this achievement, we should increasingly realize that the study of science cannot be delayed for a day like water and fire. However, water and fire can benefit people today and also hurt people. The effectiveness of science can enrich and strengthen the country, and it can also destroy culture. We should know the power of science and make good use of it. Every instrument and object can create welfare for us and produce more perfect benefits. With the abundance of our country's agricultural products and the richness of our deposits, if we can organize them with scientific methods, the progress will be limitless. This can be inferred from the two aspects of industry and railways. We deeply hope that this exhibition will arouse everyone's interest in research. What is even more advanced is that people from friendly countries have actively participated in this collection, and there are many exhibits that can be used for our reference or exploration. Academics have no borders, which is gratifying. However, we should realize that the mechanical objects needed for engineering and railways can be artificially created, improved, exchanged, and cooperated in. However, if all social problems such as politics, education, law, industry, and commerce cannot be promoted and constructed to achieve the purpose of our ideals, then permanent peace is ultimately unattainable. Therefore, our research on knowledge is not only in natural science and its application, but also should go deep into the halls of social science. This meeting is the third exhibition in the university's brief history. The scale is slightly larger than in the past. The next time it continues to be held, it should be used as a guide. What are your impressions of this meeting? I hope you will make it clear. If you are granted the favor of a compass, you will be especially grateful.</p>

Therefore, the donors were convened to discuss a solution together.

Yesterday's scene of Zhang Yingda defeating Nie Ma was particularly brilliant. Today, Shen Lince, a veteran of shooting in our country, is coming out. Mr. Shen was already famous when he studied in England 20 years ago, and he still practices tirelessly, so his experience is particularly rich. Maxwell, the opponent, is one of the famous generals in the UK. In the Group A competition, he always ranks among the best. In a match, regardless of who wins or loses, there will be an amazing performance. The competition will be held twice at 5:30 PM and 9:15 PM in the Shanghai Amateur Shooting Association in the Linhua General Association at No. 3 Beijing Road.</p>
<p>Zhang Yingda is Brilliant</p>
<h3 id="e197">With a Gun in Hand, I Can Do As I Please <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Yingda's performance yesterday can be said to be his masterpiece. With a gun in hand, he can do as he pleases. In the first 20 shots, he scored 250 points, averaging 12.5 points per shot. The foundation has been laid, and development is expected. Moreover, no shot is wasted, and the bullet has a path. At 40 shots, he exceeded the opponent by 104 points. At the end of the morning, Mr. Zhang had not finished his shots and was already leading with 500 to 405. After lunch, Mr. Zhang was also oppressed by the opponent for a while, and the distance was reduced to more than 30 points. However, he still used his superb technology in a natural state, and the three huge numbers of 68, 31, and 59 were created from his wrist, creating a large difference in distance of more than 200 points. As a result, he won a total of 263 points.</p>
<p>Nie Ma Suffers a Blow</p>
<h3 id="e198">A Strong Enemy Leads, Defeat Is Still Glorious <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Nie Ma is defeated, but his skills are good, and heroes cannot be judged by success or failure. The point that he is inferior to Mr. Zhang lies in the time between lightness and weight, thickness and thinness, and right and wrong. The power of the boy's ambition and wrist is still not fully integrated. He is cautious and careful, does not slacken in victory, and is not alarmed in defeat. He has the style of a gentleman. The final failure is also what he deserves, because his skills are still inferior to Mr. Zhang. In the first five shots of the opening, he led the way, and then he fell behind forever and never surpassed. The competition was around 50 or 60 points. Once, when he was more than 100 points behind, he suddenly got 45 points, and the distance was gradually approaching, but he was soon hit again. In the first half, he lost a total of 95 points. At the beginning of the second half, Nie Ma continued to advance, and there was a difference of more than 30 points. Unexpectedly, Mr. Zhang gained the largest amount of 68 points on that day by hitting 43 and 23 points, and from then on, he was in heaven and on earth, and could not be reached. At the end of the war, Nie Ma lost a total of 263 points.</p>

<p>A Fresh Force in the Track and Field Team</p>
<h3 id="e200">Baihong Efforts to Develop <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Actively Expand Team Affairs</p>
<p>Efforts in Long-Distance Running</p>
<p>The Shanghai Baihong Track and Field Team is organized by track and field veterans and those who are interested in track and field. In recent years, they have made unremitting efforts in track and field. On the 14th of next month, they will launch a 216-kilometer Shanghai-Hangzhou long-distance race, creating an unprecedented initiative in the Chinese sports world. The team held a banquet to entertain the press to report on the recent work situation and the Shanghai-Hangzhou long-distance race. The following is a summary of the brief speech made by Kang Yong, the representative of the team.</p>
<p>Actively Expand Team Organization: Track and field occupies an important position in sports competitions, but the Chinese people do not seem to be as interested in it as they are in ball games, and the economy of a track and field team is not as easy to mobilize and maintain as a ball team. Through the efforts of comrades and the support of all parties, Baihong has been able to occupy a position, but it cannot be complacent about this. It is currently planning to expand it. With the support of Mayor Wu and others, Mayor Wu, Director Pan Gongzhan, Shi Liangcai, Wang Xiaolai, and others have agreed to serve as directors of the association.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Hangzhou Long-Distance Running Progresses Smoothly: As for the Shanghai-Hangzhou long-distance race, after the announcement, the progress has been very smooth. In addition to members, non-members include two people from Nanjing, two people from Shanghai, and one person from Hangzhou. The director of the Public Security Bureau of this city is also very interested and has agreed to send police cars to escort the race. The long-distance race will start on the morning of the 14th at the Chen Ying Shi Memorial Tower and end at the Yinggan Bronze Statue on the shore of West Lake in Hangzhou. The gifts of prizes from all parties are also very enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Cross-Country Race Prepared to Win: The six-and-a-half-mile cross-country race to be held in Hongkou Park this Sunday has attracted many strong teams. There are also several Chinese teams participating, among which the Baihong and Russian teams are the most promising. The trophy will definitely be one of the two. Baihong is prepared to work hard to win it. It is heard that each team is limited to six participants.</p>

<h3 id="e210">Saving the Nation with Homespun Cloth <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Ran</p>
<p>Recently, there have been two very good pieces of news. One is the homespun cloth store initiated by Mr. Zhang Fengshan, the director of the Shanghai Farmers' Education Center, and the other is the homespun cloth improvement association initiated by Mr. Jin Laiwen from Taicang. They both came to me to discuss promotion, and I am very happy. I might as well introduce them: (1) Before there was a homespun cloth store, Mr. Zhang and Mr. Lü Jiren and others first set up a homespun cloth factory in Zhuanqiao called "Green Manure and Red Lean," spinning and weaving themselves. The products are very numerous, very good, and very popular with all parties. However, it is located in a remote rural area, making procurement inconvenient. Mr. Zhang and others then organized a homespun cloth store in Penglai Market. The products in the store all come from the countryside and are woven by the homespun cloth factory itself. The variety of styles is numerous; it can be said that everything is available. At the opening the other day, women in general were very welcoming and adopted it, which is truly very gratifying. (2) After suffering from military disasters, people in Taicang, in order to promote home industry and improve farmers' livelihoods, together with people from Jiading and Baoshan counties, organized a homespun cloth improvement association, lending yarn for weaving. In the past few months, a lot of homespun cloth has been woven. All the products are very sturdy and very cheap, and are unanimously welcomed in various places far and near. They are currently entrusting national products companies and national products introduction centers to promote sales. Looking at it this way, like Gandhi's method in India, promoting it in our country is also very convenient. The saying "saving the nation with homespun cloth" may soon be realized. Mr. Jin has an article called "Saving the Nation with Cloth Clothing," which is earnest and heartfelt and can be used as a reference:</p>
<p>Duke Wen of Wei revitalized the country with coarse cloth clothing, which is a beautiful story in history. Gandhi resisted the British by spinning and weaving homespun cloth, which is an expression of non-cooperation. Ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, are the same in this regard. The use of coarse cloth is great. Our country is pressured by foreign troubles, and the voice of saving the nation is already clamorous. In particular, resisting enemy goods and promoting national products are the most enthusiastic and widespread. The spirit of perseverance is definitely not comparable to the five-minute enthusiasm of the past. Promoting national products and revitalizing industry are the ways to recover lost interests, while resisting enemy goods and severing economic ties can control the enemy's life. I say that to recover lost interests, there is nothing better than promoting coarse cloth, and to control the enemy's life, there is nothing better than wearing coarse cloth. The raw material for cloth is yarn. Whether the fine yarn raw materials of today's so-called "local factory cloth" are purely national products is a question for research. In our country, apart from the Wing On Spinning Mill and the Shen Xin Spinning Mill, there are very few that can spin fine yarn to supply the raw materials for factory cloth. According to statistics, foreign yarn accounts for 80% of the fine yarn raw materials used by local cloth factories, while local fine yarn, such as Renzhong brand, accounts for only 20%. Examining the reasons, cotton seed improvement has not yet been effective, and the fiber of cotton is short and not strong, making it unsuitable for use in fine yarn, first. Spinning mill technicians can only spin coarse yarn of 20 counts or less. If they spin fine yarn, they must hire people with higher skills, and talent is not easy to obtain, second. Since local cotton is not suitable for use as raw material, and it is not easy to hire technicians, the cost price is therefore high, and the benefit of spinning fine yarn is far less than that of coarse yarn, third. Because of these three reasons, each spinning mill still lacks fine yarn spindle equipment. Even if they have purchased fine yarn spindles, they are all shelved and not used. We are enthusiastically patriotic and promote national products. All uniforms for institutions and schools use local factory cloth instead of foreign wool fabrics. However, 80% of the raw materials for local factory cloth are still inevitably made of foreign fine yarn. The so-called plan to resist enemy goods is still not thorough. For the sake of saving the country at present, to control the enemy's life and sever economic ties, each spinning mill should strive for perfect fine yarn spindle equipment and research the production of fine yarn spinning. At this time when the supply of local factory fine yarn raw materials falls short of demand, all civil servants, school teachers, and students should wear coarse cloth clothing. At celebrations, banquets, commemorative venues, and in front of leading officials and school teachers, they should take the lead in wearing blue cloth gowns and black cloth jackets, then the cloth clothing movement will surely be enthusiastically supported. In the past, Zeng Guofan inspected the Yangtze River wearing a Lingzhuang cloth robe, and Peng Yulin wore a Duoluo hemp arrow jacket during summer military parades. Even now, Lingzhuang cloth and Duoluo hemp are still sold in cloth shops everywhere. Because the leaders took the lead in promoting it, these cloths have been passed down permanently. Moreover, coarse cloth blankets and thorn hairpin cloth skirts, the two words "coarse cloth," are well-known virtues of thrift in our country's history. In the city, high hair buns are popular, with each side a foot high. In the palace, thin waists are popular, and the people reduce their food. Everything depends on the advocacy of those who know and are aware first. Or, it is said that silk raw materials are also natural products of our country. If we promote cloth clothing, the livelihoods of silkworm farmers and weavers will inevitably be affected. It is not known that the cloth clothing movement is originally a temporary plan to save the country, a plan to control the enemy's life, and there is no alternative but to use coarse cloth as a substitute for wool fabrics and factory cloth. At this time when natural disasters occur frequently and chaos is rampant, and the people are not living, it is not harmful to practice thrift. After ten years of recuperation and ten years of teaching, after the marsh of Wu, if material resources are abundant and industry expands, and fine yarn is sufficient to supply the production of cloth factories, then the raw materials used will not be limited to coarse cloth. Those with wealthy family fortunes are not prohibited from wearing local silk and rayon. We can advocate coarse cloth for our own clothing, and we should still advocate improving and expanding the original silk industry as much as possible for foreign trade, to save the precarious state of industry and commerce. Are there those in the world who will approve of my words? I pray for them at the fragrant altar.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Prospects for the National Enamel Industry <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Chengzhu</p>
<p>The enamel industry is in its budding stage. Looking at the fact that we have struggled in a difficult environment to achieve a turnover of six to seven million each year recently, and considering the close relationship between enamel products and daily life, if the situation is peaceful, transportation is convenient, and the purchasing power of the people is widespread, one can imagine how bright and brilliant the future of the enamel industry will be!</p>
<p>To talk about prospects, we must first look back. In Shanghai, many enamel factory chimneys stand tall, working all day long. Past facts tell us that from employing foreign technicians to manufacturing raw materials ourselves, from a few scattered products to an endless stream of styles, this is indeed a page of effort and progress in our country's industrial history. Especially after the Shanghai Incident last year, people in the industry, in view of the scattered pace of their counterparts, reorganized the guild, revised the rules, and improved business and accounting affairs, creating a unique and special organization.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, competition among counterparts is inevitable in the business world, and the enamel industry is no exception. However, it is already ten thousand times better than other industries. Looking at it from a long-term perspective, this phenomenon of competing for novelty and striving for the lead is ultimately a good indication of striving for progress. It is enough to only hope that it does not fall into the path of infighting and chaotic warfare among counterparts. This is our first point of view for the enamel industry in the National Products Year.</p>
<p>Secondly, if there is a spirit of open cooperation among counterparts, they should earnestly enrich their internal structure. The methods to enrich it are no more than reducing costs and improving work, because we know the importance of enamel products for daily use, and we also know that they have a trend of penetrating into the people. Then, how can the forever high prices and the unmet demand achieve the goal? Examining the current enamel products, they always cannot escape the shortcomings of being crudely made and poorly manufactured. For the sake of passive needs in the market and the pursuit of deer by counterparts, they have to specially make whole batches of sub-standard products to extend the life of the business by cutting flesh to mend sores. Furthermore, because raw materials and labor are expensive, and they cannot think of a way to alleviate the urgent need, the selling price can never be lowered. I think if everyone continues like this, without a concrete strategy to actively save the situation, the result will be terrible. This is our second point of view for the enamel industry in the National Products Year.</p>
<p>There is no shortage of insightful and far-sighted authorities in the enamel industry. Past history is sufficient to prove that the enamel industry is an industry that is more promising than any other, no matter what. If we continue to work hard from our own position, I believe that the National Products Year will be a period of transformation for the enamel industry. I remember what Mr. He Gongxing said in his book (Small Industries in Shanghai): "In the future, when you go deep into the fields, you will see that wine sellers and food deliverers in the village all carry enamel utensils." I also keep this passage in mind and have a deep hope for the enamel industry!</p>
<p>National Products Forum</p>
<h3 id="e212">Thrift Movement and Using National Products <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Yang'an</p>
<p>Recognizing that thrift is a virtue, breaking the misconception of only looking at clothes and not people, and many insightful housewives are working hard, this is not only a temporary family reform movement, but also the foundation for building a new and good social custom. Regarding the meaning and value of the thrift movement, we have already clearly acknowledged it, and in the current stage of doing it, of course, we can only do our best!</p>
<p>Speaking of thrift, it involves economics. For objects with the same function, of course, those that are cheap and of good quality are qualified. You can even be more simple and not be extravagant for the sake of winning the fancy. Then, when we choose items, national products and imported goods with the same function (pay attention to foreign goods with ulterior motives), this can give us an applicable standard.</p>
<p>According to general observation, people in cities use several times more imported goods than people in the countryside. In particular, so-called modern young men and women have become promoters of foreign goods. Therefore, residents in the countryside who are warm in cloth clothes and full with vegetable rice do not need to promote thrift and do not indulge their lives. However, the prevailing extravagance in cities and the inferiority of worshiping imported goods are not mutually causal. This is a fact that we should clearly recognize when we are doing the thrift movement.</p>
<p>Using national products is a common virtue among nationals of various countries. Sometimes, they even give up foreign goods that are cheap and of good quality and use their own products, because they have long had a recognition and determination for national products, and naturally can sacrifice themselves for the sake of the entire national economy. Regarding this point, in China, where we are starting to build national confidence in national products, we certainly cannot have extravagant hopes. However, Chinese national products are not more expensive than imported goods, so the thrift movement and using national products can be solved at the same time.</p>
<p>Because worshiping foreign goods and extravagance are mutually causal, and even more because the thrift movement and using national products can be solved at the same time, and there is also a relationship between family economy and national economy, under this cyclical situation, we naturally hope to work hard at the same time, and there is no sacrifice, no contradiction, and it can be mutually reinforcing!</p>
<h3 id="e213">Strive to Eliminate Three Evils <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Zhicheng</p>
<p>The emerging Chinese national product production industry is being parasitized by three evils, eroding like tuberculosis germs. We must bring out the spirit of General Zhou!</p>
<p>First: Everywhere is Lu Gaojian. Instead of striving to improve the product, they want to sell money by borrowing other people's signs. As a result, the one being shadowed is the one suffering the loss. Slick goods also fail, harming others without benefiting oneself. We must first eliminate this evil.</p>
<p>Second: Being brave in internal disputes is a characteristic of our noble country, but the production industry cannot be spared. Mr. Zhai Kecong once told a story that electric flashlights were first national products that overcame imported goods, but later they declined because the national product industry reduced materials and prices to compete, and as a result, imported goods still reaped the fisherman's profit. The German production industry has the virtue of not competing internally. It seems that our national product industry should also consider the entire group and eliminate this second major evil.</p>
<p>Third: Changing the appearance is certainly a despicable act. The production industry also likes to use raw materials from imported goods, which is indirectly promoting foreign goods. It is harmful that Dr. Ge Chenghui even feels that removing children is not a genuine national product. This is certainly the action of a few people, but the production industry must have customers firmly believe in national products, and they themselves must be a good example. Moreover, it is related to the reputation of national products, so it is best to (correct them if they exist, and encourage them if they do not) eliminate this third evil!</p>

<p>New Industry Introduction</p>
<h3 id="e214">Introducing a National Factory Manufacturing Elastic Band <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Si Sheng</p>
<p>Elastic band, such a small item, when it was completely dependent on Japanese goods four or five years ago, there was an outflow of tens of thousands of yuan every year. Since the emergence of the national elastic band from the Meilun Factory, because of the excellent quality of the products, the Chinese people are happy to use them, and Japanese goods have naturally been gradually eliminated.</p>
<p>The address of the Meilun Textile Factory is in Luqiu Fang, Suzhou. It was founded by Mr. Zhang Zixiang, a Wu native. At first, it specialized in making silk stockings, but it was greatly reduced due to the impact of artificial silk stockings. Later, it changed to making elastic bands, and it happened that the voice of advocating national products in the society was rising day by day, and the business was thriving. Then, it expanded its scope and added capital, and has now become a complete national product factory.</p>
<p>The Meilun Factory currently has about 130 or 40 workers. Its internal organization is led by the Manager's Office and Accounting Room as the highest authorities, managing all the affairs of the factory. Under them are the Engineering Department, Workshop, Ironworking Department, Dyeing Department, Finishing Department, and Engine Room. The Engineering Department specializes in preparing projects, such as shaking weft, warping, twisting rubber bands, winding silk, and twisting silk. All use female workers. The workshop is divided into shuttle weaving and bobbin weaving departments. Shuttle looms have foreign and Chinese types. Weavers are all male workers, and one engineer is hired to be responsible for guidance and supervision. The Ironworking Department is responsible for repairing and manufacturing machines. The Dyeing Department is responsible for dyeing. All use male workers. The Finishing Department does trivial tasks such as sizing, ironing, repairing, and boxing. Use female workers. The Engine Room specializes in generating electricity and is equipped with a motor to make up for the lack of power.</p>
<p>The source of raw materials for elastic bands, except for yarn that can be used from national products, artificial silk and rubber are all imported goods. Its looms, such as jacquard machines, which are more sophisticated, are all ordered from abroad. Its simple and ordinary machines were previously manufactured by Chinese iron factories. The working process, in simple terms, is roughly: first, the Dyeing Department dyes 丨 then it is handed over to the Engineering Department to do various preparatory work, and then it is put on the machine to weave, and finally it is handed over to the Finishing Department for finishing, boxing, and shipping out for sale.</p>
<p>The Meilun Factory employs local runners to sell and promote. A Shen Village is established in Shanghai as a hub for exporting goods and purchasing raw materials. The total business volume reaches more than 200,000 yuan per year. Because the factory is located inland, labor costs are lower than those in Shanghai, and the cost is reduced, so there is quite a surplus. Its sales cover South China, North China, and the Yangtze River Basin, as far as the Nanyang Islands. Since September 18th, sales in North China have suddenly become sluggish due to the impact of the situation and the dumping of Japanese goods. In South China and the Yangtze River Basin, it continues to maintain its advantage in competing with Japanese goods and is not defeated by Japanese goods.</p>
<p>Manufacturing elastic bands is an emerging industry in our country. The Meilun Factory has been established for less than five years and already has such achievements, which is indeed commendable and valuable. Here, on the one hand, we hope that the Meilun Factory will strive for excellence and become more and more developed. At the same time, we also hope that many other national product factories will catch up quickly and strive for the lead. Then, the future of national products will have limitless bright and brilliant hope!</p>
<h3 id="e215">About Domestic Soap <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Jie Lu</p>
<p>Soap is a daily necessity. Washing clothes and bathing require soap. The first soaps used in our country were all foreign soaps. Although there were domestic products at that time, they were crudely made and unusable. How could the outflow of benefits every year be less than tens of millions! Later, a German also set up a large soap factory in Xujiahui, Shanghai, preparing for large-scale manufacturing. However, shortly after the opening, the European War suddenly broke out. Because the Germans were going back to their country to participate in the war, Mr. Xiang Songmao, a wealthy Chinese businessman, raised funds to buy the soap factory. This is the current Five Continents Gu Ben Soap Factory.</p>
<p>Because of the completeness of the equipment and the efforts of the person taking over, the Five Continents Gu Ben Soap Factory has been growing day by day under the management of the Chinese people. The power of imported soap has slowly decreased, and domestic Gu Ben soap is already in short supply.</p>
<p>If we carefully study the reasons for the success of Gu Ben soap, it is entirely because the organizer, Mr. Songmao, is willing to take responsibility. For example, regarding the improvement of products, the chemical composition of raw materials, the harmony of oils, and the effectiveness of detergency, there are detailed inspections and research in every aspect. Especially regarding the refining process, the water content of Gu Ben soap is only 25%, while the water content of other inferior soaps is as high as 50%. Therefore, in comparison, Gu Ben soap will never undergo adverse changes.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, Five Continents Gu Ben Soap can recover benefits and occupy a glorious page in the history of national products.</p>

<h3 id="e216">Regarding Rare and Unique National Products <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Ke Ding'an</p>
<p>The Republic of China's participation in the Chicago World's Fair product exhibition had already started last month on Bailinan Road. However, due to the current critical national crisis, the exhibition was unfortunately ordered to cease, which is truly disappointing!</p>
<p>The China National Products Company was established during this eventful year for national products. It was understood that it would not have great power to accomplish earth-shattering events and compete with the Shanghai market, which is saturated with foreign goods. However, its mission is quite commendable: to promote the glory of China's national products and develop outlets for them. It also aims to collect local specialties from various regions as much as possible, striving to become the most comprehensive national products company in the country.</p>
<p>The exhibitors who were to participate in the Chicago World's Fair were understandably very disappointed by this setback. However, in line with its mission, the China National Products Company collaborated with the exhibitors to hold a re-exhibition on the second floor of its southern section. The exhibition period ended yesterday, and the exhibitors have made considerable arrangements to go to the United States independently. It would be truly gratifying if Chinese products receive awards and return with honor from Chicago!</p>
<p>Although the product exhibition at the China National Products Company lasted only a brief fourteen days, it was indeed memorable. Friendly nations' representatives accounted for as much as 40% of the daily visitors, which shows that Chinese products have many aspects that can be appreciated by international friends. We Chinese people should be ashamed if we do not support national products!</p>
<p>The exhibited products were numerous. Just taking the words of Guan Hong, a representative from Jiangxi, who said, "There are more than 250 boxes of porcelain," as proof, one can get a general idea.</p>
<p>Now, I will introduce what I consider to be rare and unique national products, listed in order. This is merely a "drop in the ocean" or, perhaps, "missing much while covering a little"!</p>
<p>The grass-woven handbags, purses, and baskets produced by Zhenxing Xian Ji in Xuhang Town, Jiading, are exquisitely woven with appropriate patterns! The tables and chairs produced by the Senlin Rattan Willow Grass Utensil Factory are made of willow, painted in light beige, and have coffee-colored tabletops and matching lines. In terms of color, they are beautiful and elegant; in terms of style, they are unique and refined, worthy of being called masterpieces of the new era. Hunan paper umbrellas have long been famous. However, the umbrellas with vermilion-lacquered bodies, brass-wrapped tops, and rattan handles are no longer suitable for modern use. They have skillfully adapted to the trend and produced many novel paper umbrellas. The ones for women are especially beautiful, with particularly bright colors and patterns. Even the long tassels on the umbrella handles are matched with the colors of the umbrella handle and body. The ones for children are small, exquisite, light, and interesting. Many children pull on their accompanying parents to buy them, but because these paper umbrellas are not for sale, the children are helpless!</p>
<p>"Chinese tea" has always been highly valued in the eyes of foreigners. However, due to unscrupulous merchants who prioritize profit over the future by mixing impurities into the exported tea, foreigners have seen through this, causing the reputation of Chinese tea to plummet and giving other countries an excellent opportunity to promote their tea.</p>
<p>The famous tea merchant Wang Yu Chang also had products on display, including several precious varieties such as "Lianfeng Sangrui," "Weiyan Kuding," "Mantou Pu'er," "Wenzhou Baihao," "Longtuan Pu'er," "Biluochun," and others.</p>
<p>The products from the Jiangxi Fuxing Company were perhaps the most numerous. The carvings on the camphor wood chests are exceptionally detailed. Motifs such as "Lotus," "Pine and Crane," "Five Steeds," "Two Qiaos," and "Imitation Han Bricks" are beyond the skills of ordinary craftsmen. Summer cloth, gauze, and other items are also excellent. Regarding porcelain, there are ancient pieces such as "Song Ding Kiln Bowls," which are light blue with faint patterns; "Tang Yingqing Bowls," which appear white at first glance but are faintly blue upon closer inspection; and "Southern Tang Yonghe Porcelain Bowls," of which there are two types: one with an uneven rim resembling an opening lotus flower, with a dark brown color and faint black patterns, and the other black with unclear white patterns. The "Tang Yingqing Huxiao Bottle" is about 1.5 feet tall with a mouth diameter of about three inches. It is light blue with excellent luster, patterns on the waist, and pointed angular patterns on the neck, which are very meaningful. The price is 100,000 yuan. The "Qinghua Bowl Made in the Jiajing Year of the Great Ming Dynasty" is dark brown with fine crackles. The "Caihua Bowl Made in the Da Ming Year of the Northern Qi Dynasty" has a white body, ochre red double lines on the bottom and rim, and a plum blossom with a crescent moon in the center of the bottom circle, which is quite interesting.</p>
<p>There were many Guanyin statues on display. My favorite is the one from "Purple Bamboo Grove," with a base diameter of about eight inches. The surface is meticulously carved with a purple bamboo grove in the back and a lotus pond in the front. Guanyin stands in front of the purple bamboo grove, holding a willow branch, with a graceful and ethereal expression full of celestial charm. A child stands on the opposite bank, making a bow with both hands. The carving has truly reached a realm of perfection.</p>
<p>Also remarkable is the "Song Longquan Empty Bottom Bowl," with a diameter of about seven inches, standing upright on a mahogany stand. The color is light green, and the bottom is empty. If it is placed upside down on a table, it looks like a modern water container. The bottom edge is dark brown, and the bowl is priced at 1,400 yuan.</p>
<p>The depictions of birds and animals are very lifelike. The most striking are the white geese, with their large buttocks almost touching the ground and their necks stretched out, calling. Their feathers are made as realistically as real ones. The prices are "three yuan" and "ten yuan." One of them is relatively small; judging by the exhibitor's affectionate expression, it is probably not for sale!</p>
<p>There are also many large porcelain vats. One is the "Imperial Kiln Golden Red Dragon Thousand-Piece Vat," priced at 1,000 yuan, which is very lovely. There is also a Bian Yao bottle, of which the exhibitor said, "It is difficult to find one like this even if thousands of bottles are fired." This is indeed true. The bottle is about nine inches tall and over a foot in circumference. The bottom of the bottle is white, the neck is brown, and the body is tinged with "brown" and "red," with distinct layers of cloud patterns, which are simply rare masterpieces.</p>
<p>There are also thousands of other items such as paintings, porcelain panels, portraits, hanging screens, tea sets, fruit, stationery, and large vases, which are truly dazzling. The products of He Wengun excel in their exquisite smallness. The "White Carved Porcelain Flower Basket" has a base diameter of about five inches, filled with many flowers, each facing upwards. The peony best displays its former majestic kingly demeanor. There is also the "Kangxi Jicui Temple Top," which is circular, about seven inches high, and about one foot and two inches in circumference, with a very bright sky-blue color.</p>
<p>The lacquerware produced by Wu Rongsheng in Yangzhou is extraordinary. The most precious is the "Inlaid Eight Treasures Zhou Pillar Figure Screen," made in the early Daoguang period, which has a very ancient feel. The carving and inlaying are truly remarkable. The exhibitor marked it with the four words "Rare Treasure," which are very suitable for the work. There are many types of stationery, small round tables, fan-shaped stools, and complete sets of square plates, all inlaid with mother-of-pearl patterns and carvings, which are worth playing with.</p>
<p>Fujian's lacquerware has a long-standing reputation. The products of the Huier Orphanage received many positive reviews this time. The statues include "Confucius," "Laozi," "Mozi," "Three Stars," "Sun Yat-sen," "Guan Yu" – both sitting and standing statues, and I think the standing ones are more spirited. "Longevity Star," "Damo," "Tieguai," "Luozu," "Qi Jiguang" – seeing General Qi's majestic appearance makes me think of the present situation and I can't help but shed tears! "Amitabha," and others each have their own unique postures, which can express the spirit of each figure. Here, one can see the author's meticulousness. There are also several masterpieces: "Cowherd and Cow," with every detail of the cow's hair meticulously rendered. The cowherd's lively state is different in each piece, which is also rare.</p>
<p>Yixing pottery, in the hands of Chen Hongshou Mansheng during the Qing Dynasty, had many masterpieces that he shaped with his own hands, but their current prices are very expensive! This time, the Yixing Vocational School Pottery Department has many new products, such as "teapots, teacups, tea trays," "vases," "flower inserts," "assembled bowls," each with dozens of varieties, and the patterns painted on them are the latest designs. There is also a "Sun Yat-sen Statue," which is made vividly and realistically.</p>
<p>Zhou Shaofu's small decorations in Wuxian can well express China's unique style. This time, he participated with a Yuan Yang Hall, which included specially made tables, shelves, chairs, stools, tea sets, cabinets, and furnishings, as well as calligraphy, paintings, screens, couplets, qin, chess, silk bamboo instruments, etc., which probably cost more than several thousand gold.</p>
<p>The display method of the antique section is unique, and the display stands are specially made of rosewood. Among them, what makes people reluctant to leave are the "Large and Small Crystal Balls on Rosewood Stands," and the "Jade Carved Great Mountain," with mountains, trees, figures, and landscapes as vivid as a painting, with deep green colors, which are truly divine. The "Guanyin Statue" is also carved from jade, with ancient-style clothing and appearance. It would be even more valuable if the color were greener. There is also the "Zhou Dynasty Jue Ding," a "Copper Washing Basin of the Han Dynasty," and an "Ancient Copper Panlong Vase," with a dragon raising its head, wanting to enter the clouds, which is very powerful. The "Carved Sailing Boat" is made by carving a section of Mao bamboo. An Old Man of the South Pole sits in the boat, holding a peach in his right hand, with a pleasant smile. A servant boy sits on the stern, very leisurely. The boat is about eight inches long, and the carving is excellent.</p>
<p>There are also silk fabrics from the Meiya Silk Weaving Factory, cotton fabrics from Sanyou, Samsung, Hongxin, China Underwear Company, and Chinese specimens, which are all breathtaking.</p>
<p>Finally, I must state that because I looked at them in a hurry, I could not introduce them to the fullest extent. I have already said that it is merely "a drop in the ocean" and "missing much while covering a little," so I will not dwell on it further.</p>
<p>Editor's Note</p>
<p>The Tang Monk's Journey to the West My old friend Chi Zongmo once said that running a national products business is as difficult and dangerous as the Tang Monk's journey to the West to seek scriptures. When sea transport was not available, communication between China and India was cut off, the Kunlun and Himalayas were two barriers, extremely high, and the shifting sands were thousands of miles, with ice covering the mountains, the Tang Monk had great faith and made great vows, one robe, one bowl, running thousands of miles, and finally reached the Buddhist kingdom. He also relied on the three-headed and six-armed Sun Wukong, the large-eared and long-mouthed Pig Bajie, and the strong Sha Wujing as his disciples, supporting him from the front and back, and supporting him from the left and right, before he succeeded. Therefore, those who run factories should learn from the Tang Monk's perseverance and seek versatile and loyal Sun Wukong, Pig Bajie, and Sha Wujing as their assistants. Mr. Chi's words are worth encouraging those who run national products businesses.</p>
<p>Women Rise Up Women have the most profound relationship with national products, and the right to use them is in their hands. Last time I heard Dr. Ge Chenghui's lecture, she said: "If a husband insists on buying foreign goods, the wife can file for divorce to deal with him." These words are really refreshing and can serve as a wake-up call for men who love to use foreign goods. We have decided to publish a special issue on "Women and National Products" to show our promotion, hoping that our female compatriots will rise up and do something.</p>

<h3 id="e217">A Decaying Household <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>"A family that passes down poetry and rites," "A scholarly family" – these signs, these hard signboards, in this day and age, have no other use than to be thrown into the latrine. A decaying household is shameful. A nouveau riche is popular.</p>
<p>Indeed, the sixth and seventh ancestors, reaching a position below one person and above ten thousand, were truly incomparably prestigious. But if the descendants are not ambitious, generation after generation, pawning and selling, eating and using, becoming accustomed to vulgarity, not seeking advancement, ending up neither cultured nor martial, neither high nor low, the broken doorway is filled with hard signs such as "A family that passes down poetry and rites" and "A scholarly family." What use are they? If the neighbor of this decaying household suddenly prospers and becomes a nouveau riche, then, whether they came from driving a cart or running a brothel, local celebrities and gentry will rush to become sworn brothers, connect genealogies, and enthusiastically flatter them. When the nouveau riche builds a house, encroaching on the land of the decaying household, and the decaying household refuses, the nouveau riche will break their head. Even though the gentry has been friends with the decaying household for generations, they will help the nouveau riche and advise the decaying household to compromise.</p>
<p>Our China has a history of thousands of years of culture, worthy of being "A family that passes down poetry and rites" and deserving of "A scholarly family." But other than that, having exhausted everything, possessing nothing, it presents a living picture of a decaying household. And Japan, with its diligent men and frugal women, has become an upstart that cannot be ignored. They become sworn brothers with the gentry-like England, America, France, and Germany, connect genealogies, and treat each other as equals. In the September 18th Incident, the January 28th Incident, and all the acts of invasion and plunder, how is it that the decaying household is not beaten bloody by the nouveau riche every time? How is it that the gentry who call the nouveau riche brothers do not advise the decaying household-like China to compromise every time? The nouveau riche encroaches on land, injures people, and remains unpunished. The decaying household suffers losses and endures humiliation. What can they do besides swallowing their voices, shedding tears, and suppressing their anger? The unambitious decaying household, at the slightest provocation, brandishes hard signs such as "A family that passes down poetry and rites" and "A scholarly family," truly disgracing the sixth and seventh ancestors!</p>
<h3 id="e218">Acute and Chronic Poisoning <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Bing Ding</p>
<p>If we eat arsenic or mercury, we will immediately bleed from all seven orifices, have abdominal pain and dizziness, and die. This is called "acute poisoning." Greedy friends who eat pufferfish or poisonous mushrooms still think they taste very delicious, indescribable, not knowing that the poison will soon take effect. The wronged ghosts of the pufferfish and poisonous mushrooms will come to claim your life as quickly as Yan Xijiao captures Zhang Sanlang. This is also called "acute poisoning." Friends who have tuberculosis or old smokers who inject morphine and smoke red pills, although the King of Hell does not come to invite you to have fun for a while, you have already been marked. In the near future, you will be a guest of honor in the Yama's palace! This is called "chronic poisoning."</p>
<p>It is reported that someone picked up an English letter from Jia Chuangsai Qi to Xian Erlaisen at the Zuiontei Hotel in Yokohama, Japan. It roughly said: "In October 1931, a Poisoning China Radical Drug Research Society was established in a certain Japanese medical school. Its purpose is to use scientific methods to put all kinds of poisons into human necessities. Among them, the toxins can cause lifelong infertility; i.e., the poison is hidden in clothing materials. There are also those that can cause cholera; such as cosmetics or utensils, which contain this kind of bacteria. Harming the Chinese people is insidious, and it can be seen generally; we who live in China should also be more careful!" It also said: I have telegraphed the government to arouse people's attention to this kind of talk. Originally, the Japanese are the most cunning and insidious, and it is inevitable that they will not follow the old trick of Wang Fengzhou poisoning Yan Donglou. Is the discovery of this letter not giving us a "warning"?</p>
<p>We must know that we like to use enemy goods for the sake of cheapness, which is "chronic poisoning," that is, "chronic suicide," and what is the difference between injecting morphine, smoking red pills, and developing tuberculosis! Now, the Japanese are impatient, thinking that it is too annoying for the Chinese to slowly become extinct and perish, so they simply put some poisons into the goods that the Chinese love to use, so as not to suffer from "chronic poisoning" of "sleeping pigs," (the Japanese call me that honor) suffer every day, groan every day, and go to the Western Paradise early (maybe it is Jewish). This is the Japanese's good intention, and we must not misunderstand it!</p>
<h3 id="e219">Talking About Invisibility <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Yesterday at a banquet, I heard Fang Benchu, a student who studied in Germany, say: "A philosopher in Berlin recently invented a kind of invisibility, which is really a strange story from abroad. This philosopher made a special suit and a special mask. When he puts them on and goes to a friend's house, the friends hear the sound but cannot see him." But I don't know what material this suit and mask are made of? It actually has such a mysterious effect. Science is really omnipotent! It is a pity that there is still a kind of sound. If there is no such sound, wouldn't it be better!</p>
<p>Invisibility is an old saying that has always existed in our country. Lang Huan Ji: "After Lord Father wore barbarian clothes, he often observed the celestial phenomena at night. One night, a divine man descended from the sky and授Lord Father with the art of invisibility." But it has never been discovered in fact. If there is really such a kind of invisibility, then this invisible person will be able to do whatever he wants alone. Rich families, precious treasures and ornaments can be arbitrarily obtained, and beautiful concubines and charming Ji can be entertained. Wouldn't the rich and powerful be terrified?</p>
<p>I remember a joke from the past: "A person learned the art of invisibility from a magician and returned home. After performing the magic, he asked his wife, 'Can you see me?' His wife said, 'You are standing in front of me, how can I not see you?' The person thought that the magic was not correct, and 重行 drew symbols and burned incantations. When he asked his wife again, his wife answered as before. After doing this several times, his wife was quite annoyed and said that she could not see him. The person was very proud and ran out. Seeing the meat hanging in the butcher shop, he tried to take a pig's trotter, but he didn't get the meat and was beaten by the butcher."</p>
<p>Japan is a country with a conscription system. In recent years, it has been engaged in militarism and implemented a nationwide general mobilization. Therefore, the recruitment of new soldiers is very popular, but the Japanese have come up with various methods to avoid joining the army, either turning their eyes into deep myopia or starving themselves to reduce their body weight, because those with myopia and weak bodies are not qualified to join the army. There is also a kind of superstition. If you want to avoid joining the army, ask a thirty-three-year-old woman to pluck three hairs and wrap them in red cloth, sew them into the placket of the clothes, which is a kind of invisibility that can avoid the inspector's poisonous eyes, which is so ridiculous!</p>
<h3 id="e220">Finished Products and Unfinished Products <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Fei Zishi</p>
<p>Jehol has already fallen! The focus of the war is currently on Gubeikou, Xifengkou, and Lengkou. It is said that Lengkou has been recovered long ago, and Xifengkou has been defeated by General Song Zheyuan's frontal attack. Gubeikou is also persevering. The three Kou are finished products, which shows the character of Chinese soldiers. If it is like Tang Yulin guarding Jehol, losing four important passes in a few days, it is simply useless and becomes a homeless dog (reward).</p>
<h3 id="e221">The Logic of Life <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Benxi</p>
<p>We can see very beautiful people arguing with rickshaw drivers or vendors over one or two pennies. Or, if you're unlucky, they might even raise their hands and slap them once or twice. From a positive perspective, it seems that Shanghainese are so thrifty that they even consider one or two pennies.</p>
<p>In fact, let's put aside the bourgeoisie. Have you ever seen a young man in a suit bending down to pick up a penny that fell in public? On the other hand, in the barber shop, the price is four jiao, but you want to give them one yuan, and when you eat in a restaurant, the tip is already included in the bill, but you still give the waiter the change. Is this extra gift a traditional rule? Or is it a habit that must be possessed by the beautiful class living in the city? Philosophers and philosophers, it really makes me puzzled.</p>
<p>Similarly, satisfying life, decoration and eating are more superior to walking more. How advanced is this metaphysics? In fact, to put it bluntly, a person who is happy to bargain with a rickshaw driver for one or two pennies will definitely not pretend to be bourgeois and show off. How many people in Shanghai care about every penny when dealing with the working class but spare no expense when decorating themselves? The logic of life in Shanghai adds another contradictory example.</p>
<p>Long Novel</p>
<h3 id="e222">Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>In the third chapter, he finally bears the heart to solve the problem and enters the door. He wrongly secretly pities the maid and is willing to share food as a reward.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, as soon as he entered the door, the people in the mansion, without asking any questions, blasted him out, saying that our master said that he would not allow you to come in the future, so don't enter this gate. Such a big girl, for no reason, received such a lesson, you think, how can people's face stay in place? Jiang Shi's words completely expressed the grievance in Guizhi's heart. Guizhi didn't listen, but after listening, his heart was sour, and two lines of tears flowed down. Ji Zhi knew that his brother's order had been issued and implemented. This is definitely not a false statement. Denying it cannot be denied, but admitting it is not convenient to admit, so he had to say with a stern face: This is the rogue in my family, how can he say such a thing. I will definitely punish him heavily when I go back. Guizhi looked at her mother, but said: How can you blame the people below, the people above have no words, how dare the people below say such a thing? Ji Zhi said: I just came back from the government, I don't know these things at all, I will ask clearly when I go back, and then come and apologize to the old girl. Guizhi said: We are satisfied with these few words from the second master, please don't ask when you go back, if you ask something bad, you will add something wrong to us. Our mother and daughter are poor and people in the bedroom, and there is nowhere to go if we make trouble. Speaking, his voice hardened, and he pulled out a handkerchief from under his ribs and rubbed his eyes again. At this time, even though Ji Zhi wanted to use words to comfort people, he felt that he had no way to speak, and stood blankly in the house, unable to say a word. In the past, Jiang Shi always treated Ji Zhi with extra courtesy, but today his attitude was very cold. Ji Zhi stood in the middle of the house, standing with nothing to do, and could not use any language to comfort them. At this time, their mother and daughter, one lowered her head and sat weeping, and the other lowered her head to mend clothes. Ji Zhi was always standing here, and he also felt bored, so he bowed his hands to Jiang Shi and said: Thousands of apologies, ten thousand apologies, I am always sorry, please forgive the old girl, I really don't know about this. If I am at home, this kind of thing will never happen. Speaking, he walked out listlessly. (27)</p>

<p>We all probably know that the global kingdom of automobiles is the United States. This is because the United States has so many cars, with an average of one car for every six people. When it comes to bicycles, the Netherlands must be mentioned first. According to a recent survey, the total number of bicycles in the Netherlands is 2,858,569, while the population of the Netherlands is only eight million, averaging 35 bicycles per 100 people, which means there is one bicycle for every three people.</p>

His wife's friend, a beautiful widow, heard that Johannes had been ill for a long time and went to visit him at the hospital. However, she had no other relationship with Johannes. However, when she visited him, she always kissed Johannes twice, once when she arrived and once when she left, as a gift for visiting him. Later, Johannes' wife found out and became very jealous, so she filed for divorce in court. The judge ruled that "kissing the sick is acceptable" and dismissed the lawsuit. From then on, kissing another person's wife in the Vienna Hospital was not only not considered taboo, but also considered very fashionable.</p>

<h3 id="e231">Gold Prices Fall by More Than Ten Yuan <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>Spot Goods Pouring In Continuously</p>
<p>Tongfeng Heng and Others Suddenly Throw Out</p>
<p>Swap Positions Exceed Ten Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>The gold market saw a decline yesterday. Spot goods from the Tianjin gang continued to pour in. In addition to doing swaps, various spot firms were also throwing out futures. Tongfeng Heng sold off aggressively, and gold prices were difficult to support. At the morning opening, due to the London cable news, both near-term and far-term prices rose by 0.0625. New York silver prices rebounded by 0.125, and far-term silver prices also rebounded by a few cents to more than one penny, which really made people feel weak. Bank private cables were unchanged. The exchange rate opened with the British and American rates both harder than the previous close, and the hair market was low. At the opening, the price was 1080 yuan. Macari and others settled June US dollars at 29.75, and then tightened to 6875. Gold prices then gradually rose from 79.3 yuan, and July US dollars also rose from 30 yuan to 29.9375, rising to 1083.4 yuan. After that, spot firms came to sell, and the exchange rate also hardened slightly as a result. No one wanted to settle July US dollars at 29.9375. HSBC listed the British and American dollars, both rising by 0.125. July US dollars at 30 yuan were still difficult to sell, and reached 78 yuan. After that, banks traded at the price of 30 yuan, rising and falling from time to time, but the range was extremely narrow, with the upper limit not exceeding 81 yuan and the lower limit difficult to break 77 yuan, hovering for a long time. Macari sold out June US dollars at 29.6875, and then retreated from beyond 80 yuan. Silver companies sold even more of the same month at 29.75. The exchange rate had hardened and was even lower. At the close, it was 1077.2 yuan. It was found that the fluctuation during half a day was extremely small. The exchange rate had not been seen to loosen, but the gold market was dismal because spot goods flooded the market, and spot firms such as Tongfeng Heng suddenly sold more than a thousand bars. Moreover, due to the rumors that Tongfeng Heng's bars were from the Central Bank, people's confidence was shaken. However, upon closer examination, the reason for the decline was always the increase in spot goods. This news has been reported in previous Japanese newspapers. Continuous swaps have resulted in positions exceeding 10,000 taels. The futures thrown out in this city have not yet been counted. The ferocity of the source can be imagined. The red bar should be lowered, so it is increased by 33.5 yuan. The discount for swaps in April and May has been reduced to 22 yuan. Now the market situation for half a day is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 1080 yuan, down 7.9 yuan from the previous close. Goods opened at 80.3 yuan. The exchange rate also opened hard. The near-term price of British exchange was 1 shilling 8 pence 4375, slightly looser than the previous close by 0.0625. The US exchange was 29.125, calculated to be 0.125 harder. Then it fell from 80.02 yuan to 79.3 yuan. Macari bought June US dollars at 29.75, and Hengyu first entered, then gradually rose to around 81 yuan. Yifeng Yong also bought in at this time, and the upward trend was more stable. Sumitomo bought July US dollars at 30 yuan, and Taixing Yong even advanced to 2.5 yuan. Although it fell slightly due to goods arbitrage, Macari's settlement of June US dollars was already 6875, and Hengyu and Shunli both took in, so it was good to 3 yuan. Mitsui bought July US dollars at 9375. Tongfeng Heng sold off, but was still able to rise from 1.2 yuan to 1083.4 yuan. The exchange rate was slightly relaxed at this point. July US dollars at 29.9375 could not be sold. Spot firms such as Tongfeng Heng aggressively sold off, and gold prices were difficult to support and trended downstream. To around 80 yuan, Zhaofeng Chang sold even more and broke the 80 yuan mark. In addition, HSBC's listing was also announced at this time, with both British and American dollars rising by 0.125, and people's confidence was greatly weakened. July US dollars at 30 yuan were also difficult to sell at this point. Fuchang sold even more and fell to around 8 yuan. Before long, North Korea took in July US dollars at 30 yuan, Yuanheng bought slightly and it was 9 yuan. Fuchang suddenly came to buy, and then rose to around 80 yuan, but because Huabi sold April US dollars at 29.25 to Pan Gen, and Pan Gen sold June dollars at 75, Yuan Mao Yong came to sell, and it still fell between 8 and 9 yuan. When Huabi bought July US dollars at 30 yuan, Hengyu then advanced to beyond 9 yuan. April US dollars at 29.25, banks traded, Yuanmao and Fuchang both took in, and then rose to beyond 80 yuan to 0.05 yuan. Unfortunately, the trend was not good, and many sellers sold off. Bingxing sold bars and retreated to within 10 yuan. Goods arbitrage was sold again and fell further. Qianchang Xiang sold even more and retreated to 78.2 yuan. Macari and Zhengjin traded July US dollars at 29.9375, Fuyu came up to the market to buy bars, and again penetrated 80 yuan, and rose to 80.05 yuan. Macari sold out June US dollars at 29.6875, Qianchang Xiang and Qingfa Yong both came to sell, and again retreated to within 79 yuan. Hengxing sold even more to 8.5 yuan. Retail investors bought in, and Xiexing Yong also came to buy slightly, and it was good to 80.2 yuan. Hongxing sold off, and the trend was still small. Hengxing continuously sold bars on behalf of customers, and gold prices were even more unsustainable. Silver companies sold out June US dollars, already at 29.75. Hengxing's selling interest was not shallow, and there were few opponents in the market. Bingxing took advantage of the situation to sell, and then fell to 77.2 yuan, hovering for a long time, and still fell from 7.7 yuan. The closing price was 1077.2 yuan. After the market closed, Ruikang came up to sell, and there was no sharp fall. Hengyu and Yuan Mao Yong competed to sell, retreating to within 5.5 yuan. Yuanheng took in bars at a low price, and was then pulled up. Hengxing even came to buy in, to around 7 yuan. The final price was around 7.5 yuan, and goods were auctioned early at 6.5 yuan. There was no market in the afternoon due to Wednesday. It was found that the highest price in half a day was 1083.4 yuan, and the lowest price was 1077.2 yuan, with a difference of 6.2 yuan. As a result, it fell 10.07 yuan lower than the previous close.</p>
<p>The quoted price was 28.75 yuan due to HSBC's listing of US exchange rising by 0.125, and the alloy price was approximately 1159 yuan. According to the closing price, it was about 82 yuan weaker, less than 6 yuan more than the previous close. The recorded price for April was 1099 yuan, May 1077 yuan, and water replenishment 1096 yuan.</p>
<p>There was not much trading in the market. In summary, Hengxing, Tongfeng Heng, Zhaofeng Chang, Bingxing, Hongxing, Qianchang Xiang, Yifeng Yong, Ruikang, etc. all sold, and Hengyu, Daxing Yong, Fuchang, Yuanheng, Fuyu, Shunli, Wanxing, Yuanmao, Hengxingyuan, etc. all bought. Daliang gang Shunli and Wanxing slightly took in. Guang gang Hengxing sold more than 200 and entered scattered amounts. The total amount of bars in May was 19,411 bars.</p>
<p>The red bar price has fallen with the swap discount. Yesterday's market was calculated to increase by 33.5 yuan. The Hakka gang dumped, and spot firms slightly took in.</p>
<p>The swap discount for April and May continued to fall. Fuchang gave a discount to Dafeng Heng of 7, 10 bars, for 22 yuan. Market positions (short side) were relatively scarce, and it was difficult to satisfy the appetite of spot firms. After entering, Fuchang again gave a discount to Yingfeng Heng of 70 bars, still for 22 yuan. Ruixing slightly gave out positions, but no deals were made. Swap prices have been cheap in recent days, which is really due to the influx of spot goods from the Tianjin gang. Yingfeng Heng alone has swapped out more than a thousand bars. In addition, Dafeng Heng also swapped out. At least 10,000 taels have arrived recently. As of the previous day, there were still 5,866 bars left in April.</p>

US cotton was also high. The opening price of near-term US exchange was 29.125, 0.125 harder than the previous close. At first, the banks were calm, but the trend was tight, so Macari first took in June US dollars at 29.75, and then ate 6875. Sumitomo initially bought July US dollars at 30 yuan, and continued to tighten to 29.9375. Mitsui and others all took in, but because the gold market was low, this price was difficult to sell. HSBC's listing was announced, with both shilling and US dollars rising by 0.125. July US dollars at 30 yuan were difficult to sell. After that, it was extremely peaceful, with only 0.0625 competing with each other. Bank trading was still strong. Finally, it loosened slightly.

<p>The May term opening price is especially high</p>
<p>The Exchange is closed today for settlement</p>
<p>Yesterday, the public bond market on the Chinese Business Securities Exchange was still quite excellent. The first day of the auction of May futures, most of them were opened one after another. Trading was brisk, and market prices were especially firm. People were optimistic. The Arbor Day was approaching in an instant, and most people were unwilling to keep short positions before the holiday to prevent further drastic changes. The demand from the Northern gang was unremitting throughout the day, so the trend was steadily rising. From the initial opening in the morning to the opening in the afternoon, the price in each of the three sessions was gradually increasing. Each session rose by about half a yuan. May trading has gradually been done openly. The market price is firmer in May. Transactions are mainly done by collecting No. 20 and No. 34.

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Bank reported that the New York stock market on Tuesday (28th) was still weak at the beginning, but in the last hour, due to the strength of wheat and cotton, it rebounded sharply. As for wheat, it was because the production situation in the southwest, northwest, and Pacific coast was not good, and as for cotton, it was because the rural relief plan seemed to limit production. Most speculators were standing by, waiting for the trend. The total turnover for the whole day was 600,000 shares. The Dow Jones index is listed on the left:</p>

<p>The yarn market started to fall and then rose. The actual demand for yarn is sluggish. The various gangs still have no intake. A part of it is said that the yarn factory is in trouble, and there is a fear of automatic reduction of working hours. Therefore, the buying wind is more intense, and the market price is slightly higher. As for what the future holds, we are still thinking about the sales aspect.</p>
<h3 id="e238">Man-Made Standards Fall More Than Rise <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>In the early market of the man-made standard, the market was still good due to the rise in foreign cotton. Each month rose by 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 qian. The falling wind suddenly rose in the second and third sessions, which was said to be due to poor actual sales. As a result, each month fell by 0.5, 0.8, 0.9 qian to 1-2 liang. In the afternoon, scattered shorts bought in to profit, and the market price rebounded. Each month rose by 0.3, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.8 qian. The total turnover for the whole day was 47,450 bales. It was found that Dafeng sold 1,750 bales, Yukang 750 bales, Xiesheng 900 bales, Dachang Cheng 1,050 bales, and Xincheng 950 bales.

<p>The cotton market was tired in the morning and rose in the afternoon, but the situation was still weak. Because yarn sales were sluggish, the factories were extremely cautious in purchasing raw materials. Therefore, the consumption of local cotton was relatively clear, and the sales and prices of Indian cotton were accommodating. Therefore, people's hearts were tired. Only a part of them turned from short to long. There were two major bulls who still had no intention of closing out. And a certain factory's thoughts tended to be downstream, and brokers massively threw shorts, with an amount of 35,000 dan. The market price was thus loose and excessive. As for what the future holds, it still depends on foreign cotton for expansion and contraction.</p>

<p>In the early market of the Zheng standard, the market rose by 0.15 yuan following the rise in foreign cotton. In the third session, the market suddenly fell, because of the lack of buyers.

It is estimated that futures rose by 10-13 pound sounds, and spot goods rose by 15 pound sounds. British cotton futures and spot goods fell by 7 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods fell by 9 points.

<h3 id="e244">Food and Rice Market Transactions Are Not Very Brisk <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than 20 sources, and both urban and rural stores had sales. Baozi handled more than 1,000 stones. The market situation was stable and active. The prices of Su Tong gang and Nangang Qingjiao rice increased by several fen. Du Yangjian still remained stable. Bian Yin Yuan Yin Yuan price was high, and the sales of Bian Yuan were balanced. There was no difference in price.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were 34-35 sources from various gangs in Hexia. Bai Geng was still shouting for tight sales in the morning. The store stomach and scattered slack sales led to a stable market situation. Bo Geng Zaodao continued to arrive, and scattered sales did not work, and the price was weak again. The Xian market also saw a weakening trend, and Bai Yuan was also a little bit more expensive.</p>
<h3 id="e245">Jiangxi Machine Late Rice Falls Below Eight Yuan <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were slightly more arrivals of Hakka Xian. However, the Min gang's appetite was sluggish again. The Tongshi only handled 584 packages of Hunan Machine Red Rice. Other rice was not asked about. There was sufficient stock of Jiangxi rice, but the Min gang did not handle it. The market was even more sluggish, and the price showed signs of falling. Because its price was worth it, the Ben Street tried to handle more than 100 packages each of Machine Early and Machine Late Rice. The price suddenly fell by 0.2 yuan. Gan Machine Late actually fell below 8 yuan. The price of Machine Early High Goods also fell below 7 yuan. Machine Early opened at 6.9 yuan, and Machine Late at 7.92 yuan. Hunan Machine Red was 8.25-8.1 yuan. There were few arrivals and stocks of Machine Boat, and both the local and Hakka gangs had an appetite, so only a small number of points were taken.</p>
<h3 id="e246">Powdered Wheat Market Continuously Declining with a Slight Rebound <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>The Rebound of Imported Wheat Is Not Without Its Significance</p>
<p>After the afternoon opening of the flour market, prices for various months showed signs of stabilization. Due to the price of imported wheat rising by two, three, or four jiao, the sentiment in the near term immediately appeared brisk after the opening. As actual sales remain active, there may not be an excess of goods for this month, which stabilizes sentiment and improves buying interest. For distant months, manufacturers limited their sales, and speculators covered their positions, tightening the market. Near-term prices rose by seven and a half li, and distant prices rose by about one fen. However, by the afternoon opening, the market for various months showed signs of weakness. Because delivery is approaching for this month, some non-industry speculators are exiting the market, causing prices to level out. As for distant months, there is concern about the dumping of imported wheat, and non-industry buying interest has waned. The overall outcome depends on the source of imported wheat. As a result, this month's price is up five li from the previous day, April's up one fen, May's up seven and a half li, June's up one fen and two and a half li, and July's up five li.</p>
<p>After the morning and afternoon openings of the wheat market, prices for various months showed signs of being close to level and stable. With the price of imported wheat rebounding by two, three, or four jiao, sentiment turned stable. Due to the surge of imported wheat in April, the market showed signs of oversupply, so the market was flat and buying interest was weak. For distant months, the price increase of imported wheat led some short sellers to cover their positions slightly, which tightened the market. However, this localized rise and fall cannot be considered conclusive. As a result, this month's price is down one fen from the previous day, May and June were not opened, July's up one fen, and August's up two fen.</p>
<h3 id="e247">Dalian Bean Cake Arrivals Uninterrupted <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>Price Already Down Three Fen</p>
<p>Six thousand more Dalian plain-edged bean cakes arrived, causing sellers to lower prices to attract buyers. Yesterday, 2,600 cakes were sold, mainly to inland buyers, at a price three fen lower than the initial opening. There are reportedly another three to four thousand cakes on the way, so market sentiment is weak. Overall, actual sales have not improved, and most domestic buyers remain cautious, so the market is sluggish. Factory prices remain firm, and the market has not complied. Both supply and sales of miscellaneous grains are competitive, and the market shows no special changes. Yesterday, Guangdong buyers purchased 281 packages of Ben Niu Gang beans, with a price of four liang, one qian, and five fen. This small quantity of specialty goods is showing good signs.</p>
<h3 id="e248">Refined Sugar from Ti Zhuang Slightly Up Amidst Scarce Arrivals <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was flat due to firm benchmark prices and a slight increase in the Dutch exchange rate. The guild's trades mostly had asking prices but no transactions. Grade 24 coarse white sugar remained at fifteen liang and five fen, Grade 20 medium white sugar at fourteen liang and six qian, Grade 18 at fourteen liang and four qian, and Grades 8 and 9 Dutch red sugar at eleven liang and nine qian. Guangdong merchants offered over two hundred packages of domestically produced Huizhou foreign white sugar at twelve liang and a half. Chaozhou merchants offered seventy-one packages of refined sugar from Ti Zhuang at nine liang and five fen (commission excluded), which is up five fen from the previous trading session. Hainan red sugar remained tight, with an asking price of ten liang and five qian, but no transaction was made. Since its price drop, Jianbing sugar sales remain sluggish, but warehouse stocks are very low, and arrivals are scarce, so sellers are unwilling to lower prices further.</p>

<p>Due to sluggish sales of Hunan lotus seeds in various regions, the price has declined. According to a letter from Hankou, the price is also easing, with each dan priced at thirty-one to thirty liang. Here, high-quality goods are offered at fifty-seven liang, and ordinary goods at fifty-three or fifty-four liang, with only sporadic transactions. Sales of white lotus seeds are also weak, and prices in Lan Di have rebounded slightly by two or three yuan, with market prices also up by one or two liang. Yesterday, the market price was fifty-three liang. However, inventories are confirmed to be low, and industry insiders expect prices to rebound in the future.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the local foreign firm silk market lacked vitality. Due to the decline in Yokohama Japanese silk prices, silk prices in New York, London, and other places continued to fall. Sales of Lyon silk are also sluggish, and there are no signs of improvement in silk telegrams to Shanghai. European and American firms in the local market only engaged in covering short positions, with no actual sales. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson imported ten bales of white factory warp, Da Chang imported ten bales of yellow factory warp, Public Security imported five bales of white dry warp, and Er Xing imported twelve bales of coarse yellow silk, with prices remaining flat and weak.</p>

<p>Since merchants in Hankou began purchasing six-fen packing iron sheets, market inventories have become low. Although shipments have arrived from London, Basel City, and other ports, they are insufficient to meet demand, so the market is brisk. Each dan can be priced up to seven liang, eight or nine qian. It is reported that two or three thousand dan were traded in the past two days.</p>

<p>According to a Reuters dispatch yesterday, the fixed price for 90-pound British tinplate is 18 shillings per box, up four pence from before. 100-pound tinplate is 19 shillings and six pence, up two pence. Steel from Huisi is 16 pounds, also up half a gold pound from before. However, there are few buyers, and the market is quiet.</p>

<p>American white iron is high due to the tightening of the American exchange rate. After the US exchange rate increased, the cost of goods for the American white iron market has increased. For example, Grade 24 is priced at sixteen liang per dan, Grade 26 at eighteen liang and five qian, Grade 28 at seventeen liang and two qian and a half, and 48 sheets at fifteen liang and seven qian and a half, all up two or three qian from the previous market. Recently, sales of 48-sheet varieties to Hankou, Sichuan, Fujian, and other regions have been most active, and local manufacturers have also widely purchased Grade 26. However, there are fewer buyers for Grade 24 and Grade 28.</p>
<p>British white iron shipments are abundant and weak. British white iron shipments have been abundant recently, and inventories are high, so sentiment is soft. Due to the manipulation of brokers and buyers, prices have become more sluggish. The current market price for Grade 24 is eleven liang and four qian and a half, Grade 26 is eleven liang and seven qian and a half, Grade 28 is twelve liang and seven qian and a half, seven feet is one liang and seven and a half fen, and six feet is nine qian and three fen, all down two or three qian to three or four qian from the previous market price. Moreover, foreign firms are actively seeking to sell spot goods recently, making the market feel even more relaxed.</p>

<h3 id="e257">On Forgetfulness <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Dafu</p>
<p>The "five-minute enthusiasm" refers to the Chinese people forgetting any extreme humiliation after five minutes. Like the woodcutter of Mount Nanke, although the length of time is somewhat different, both are examples of forgetfulness. Speaking of forgetfulness, it does not seem to be a unique characteristic of the Chinese people. I remember seeing an anecdote in the stories of German writers:</p>
<p>The playwright and literary critic Lessing was once taking a walk after writing. On the way, he met a postman delivering letters. "Do you have a letter for me?" Lessing asked. "What is your name, sir?" the postman asked in return. Lessing scratched his head and thought for a long time, but he could not remember his own name. So he had to say with a wry smile, "Let me go home and ask."</p>
<p>This kind of absent-mindedness after focusing one's attention seems to be common to people of all countries, but Chinese forgetfulness is more practical. For example, when warlord infighting begins, both sides issue telegrams, each cursing the other with the most venomous language, vowing to never coexist. But soon after, they turn hostility into friendship, and in an instant, they call each other brothers, with affection surpassing flesh and blood. The warlords are like this, and so are the politicians. We only need to pull out old newspapers and flip through them to see many such facts. When the National Revolutionary Army arrived in Shanghai, the propaganda posters were full of depictions of the Northern Warlords that they sought to overthrow. They drew a turtle with the name of a warlord on its shell. After the change of flags, however, Zhang San and Li Si were all comrades. Zhang Zongchang, who had an arrest warrant issued against him, was given a pension by the government after he was killed. Someone avenging his father was granted a special pardon by the state. After the May Fourth Movement, everyone advocated filial impiety, but now the articles of the Constitution stipulate that sons have the duty to respect their parents. Apart from this pragmatic forgetfulness, general forgetfulness is indeed beneficial to us humans in many ways.</p>
<p>First, the most common fact is that if something terrible happens at night, after one night, when you get up in the morning and see the sun, everything is dispelled, and the matter that was so urgent seems to have a way out. This is an experience that everyone often encounters. Second, the pain of life and death is known to all. Fortunately, healthy people forget death, so they go to run businesses and form societies. Women forget the pain of childbirth, so they go on to have second and third children, preserving the race. The modern British essayist Robert Lynd also talked about these things in an essay entitled "The Pleasures of Ignorance." Here, I would like to change the last word to Forgetfulness, calling it "The Pleasures of Forgetfulness." The most concrete proof of this topic is the Summer Palace, which the Empress Dowager Cixi built after the defeat, using funds from the navy. Now the Japanese imperialist army seems to only use the Great Wall as a boundary, and will no longer invade the south. I do not know, for the sake of saving the country through aviation, whether the many patriotic donations obtained by the movie queen and others advocating entertainment to save the country will be used to build a second Summer Palace in Lushan or West Lake.</p>
<h3 id="e258">Street Exhibitions <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Heng</p>
<p>On the streets, on the streets of this most prosperous city in the East, have you often seen those ugly exhibitions that make people unable to bear to look at, those various disabled people?</p>
<p>On the wide roads, trams and cars are speeding, and on the sidewalks on both sides, there are crowds of people coming and going. Among the clothes of these pedestrians, there are always disabled people sitting or crawling. They have either lost an arm, broken a leg, gone blind, or have festering flesh. Their heads are almost always bowed to the ground, facing the passing pedestrians, hoping that someone might take out one or two copper coins from their pockets and drop them into the alms bowl placed in front of them. But it is not easy to get someone to drop money in, so they cry bitterly, moan, and especially show the ugliest and most pitiful parts of their bodies in order to gain human sympathy. If these existing disabilities are not enough to arouse people's pity, then they will pretend to accidentally, but in fact deliberately, re-injure some part of their body, and fresh blood drips on the ground. When their nerves feel a kind of unbearable pain, their roar and their lament can also make pedestrians feel real and tragic. Then, his alms bowl will be able to receive a few more copper coins! I have personally seen a disabled person with half a leg crawling in front of the gate of a school, deliberately breaking his nose on the stone steps. Blood splashed on the ground, and he lay there motionless, as if facing the sky, and as if facing cruel humanity, crying, scolding, and weeping. That hoarse voice and that tragic scene made those who saw and heard it feel as if they were in a ferocious hell.</p>
<p>I never bear to hear such lamentations or tragic situations, and I never bear to look at them. To me, they are like demons, making me avoid them, so, I honestly say, I have never given a penny to such disabled people. Because I absolutely do not have the courage to approach them, even if I close my eyes and drop money into their alms bowl. Sometimes, I catch a glimpse from afar or just realize that there is such an ugly shape lying ahead, and my nerves will immediately convulse, casting a heavy shadow on my heart.</p>
<p>I remember when I was reading literary history before, the Romantics or Idealists taught us that the task of writers should be to try to hide or avoid observing the ugliness of reality, and to create works that beautify life. Perhaps this is reasonable, but not in our current society. Can you stay in a house for the rest of your life and not go out to the streets once? And how can you avoid seeing this ugly exhibition on the streets? What ugliness of reality is greater than this?</p>
<p>It is impossible to hide, and there is no need to hide, all the sores of this existing society. Someday, the roars of these ugly disabled people will drag down this entire cruel society.</p>
<h3 id="e259">An Explanation of "Attempt" <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Lu Fangweng's poem says, "Attempting success has never happened since ancient times." Hu Shi gave it a turn of phrase: "Success has always been in attempting." He also said: "I have sought teachers for twenty years, and now I have obtained the two words 'attempt': one must do poetry and business like this, and although one may not reach it, one still has ambition." Lu Fangweng's personal experience was very deep. Seeing the country broken and the family destroyed, and the situation getting worse day by day, those who sold the country for peace were truly "without hearts or livers," and those who were patriotic and advocated war were just "shouting empty slogans that did not hit the mark." So he said indignantly, "Attempting success has never happened since ancient times!" What he meant was that saving the country required a whole plan, to be done practically and realistically. Relying on luck and taking shortcuts would not succeed. (The meaning is very clear, please see the original poem.)</p>
<p>And our Dr. Hu Shi learned the secret of living from the opposite side of this poem. He saw that Chinese society was a chaotic society, and nothing was on track. To appear on stage and become a big figure in this society, the first thing to do is to speculate. For example, buying a lottery ticket, winning the jackpot, wouldn't you be very rich? If you never buy a lottery ticket in your life, you will never have the hope of winning the jackpot. The jackpot comes from buying a lottery ticket. This is what Dr. Hu Shi called: "Success has always been in attempting." Which is what Shanghai people call "trying your luck."</p>
<p>Our Dr. Hu Shi, he has won the jackpot. There are many students studying in the United States, but he alone has become a new cultural guide, a member of the Sino-British Cultural Fund Committee, and a member of the Peking Political Branch. There are many other benefits. When he took a trip to Hunan, he received a special offering of five thousand yuan. This is what he himself said: "I have sought teachers for twenty years, and now I have obtained the two words 'attempt': one must do poetry and 'business' like this, and although one may not reach it, one still has ambition." We congratulate him: "Ambition eventually succeeds!"</p>
<p>Since the May Fourth Movement, people have all "attempted" and "speculated" everywhere. This is the best achievement of the New Culture Movement! Alas!</p>
<p>(Note) There is a great deal of evidence that Hu Shi spent his life watching the wind and hanging the sail, speaking according to the opportunity. Please refer to my recently compiled Hu Shi Literary Genealogy.</p>
<h3 id="e260">Tengwang Pavilion <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Wen Juan</p>
<p>As soon as I arrived in Nanchang, I went to look for Tengwang Pavilion, but after walking all over Nanchang City, I still didn't know where the world-famous Tengwang Pavilion was. So I silently recited the words of Wang Bo's preface and searched along the riverbank. When I reached the front of the Water Public Security Bureau, I met an old man and went up to ask:</p>
<p>"Old man, do you know where Tengwang Pavilion is?" The old man sighed.</p>
<p>"This is Tengwang Pavilion! You don't know even when you see it!" He pointed to the small and humble Public Security Bureau building and said with emotion.</p>
<p>However, I was still confused. It was clearly the Public Security Bureau, so how could he insist that it was Tengwang Pavilion? After the old man's explanation, I realized that this building of historical value had long been destroyed by war. Later, someone built this Water Public Security Bureau on the original site of the pavilion.</p>
<p>The old man continued:</p>
<p>"This pavilion was built in the fourth year of the Xianqing era of the Tang Dynasty, when Prince Teng Yuan Ying was the governor of Hongzhou (Nanchang's ancient name was Hongzhou). It originally had two pavilions, an outer pavilion on Chao Wang Zhou (which collapsed in the Tang Dynasty) and an inner pavilion, which was this Tengwang Pavilion. In the second year of the Xianting era of Emperor Gaozong of Tang, Yan Boyu, the governor of Hongzhou, renovated the pavilion once, and Wang Bo's preface was written at that time. Later, Emperor Taizu of Ming visited Nanchang once after 'universal peace,' and held a grand banquet for his meritorious officials in this pavilion, and released a deer raised by Chen Youliang to Xishan. His ministers catered to his psychology and built a large archway in front of the pavilion, titled 'The First Building Under Heaven.' It suffered a fire during the Wanli era, which almost destroyed most of it. It was rebuilt in the early Qing Dynasty, until the most recent fire six years ago, which finally ended its life." The old man coughed and continued:</p>
<p>"In the past, transportation was inconvenient, and when there were no trains, most people who went out traveled by water. This pavilion was next to the river, and the terrain was good. Whenever someone was seeing off a guest, they would set up a banquet in front of this pavilion for the farewell. It has been like this throughout the ages. Now, alas! Alas! Everything is over." The old man shook his head as he said this, and then continued to mutter something, before slowly walking eastward.</p>
<p>I stood blankly in front of this abandoned pavilion, thinking about the old man's last words, and couldn't help but have many fantasies: this small pavilion, I don't know how many words of reluctant farewells it has heard, how many parting tears it has seen. If the pavilion had consciousness, it would probably be overwhelmed by them! Oppressed by these sorrows of separation until it could not breathe! Even if it did not suffer from war, it would probably be crushed by sorrow. Now that it has been burned down, it is clean. Who can say that a soldier is necessarily a person who spoils the scenery!</p>
<p>Only those two rivers of different colors and different temperaments (the confluence of the Fu and Gan rivers, one yellow and one clear, never mixing), still rely on each other day and night, probably having seen enough of the pain of separation at the top of the building, and will never dare to separate!</p>

<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>The car turned a few corners on the small streets, drove onto the road, increased its speed, and turned again after a while. Haiquan was sitting in the car and couldn't see clearly which road it was. He just intuitively felt that the car had circled a few times in the area around Daxi Road and Hege Road, and then stopped in front of a Western-style house. Everyone got out of the car. Yaoxing sent the car away and then pressed the doorbell for a while. At this time, Haiquan saw that not far from the front of this house, there was a patrolman standing there, not paying much attention to someone coming here in a car.</p>
<p>After waiting for a while, a Western woman opened the door and came out to greet them.</p>
<p>"What is this place?"</p>
<p>He asked Yaoxing.</p>
<p>"Don't be nosy. Just follow me."</p>
<p>Everyone followed him up the stairs. They went up to the second floor, and then up to the third floor. Yaoxing stopped in front of a room at the back of the third floor. Haiquan saw a round white bone plaque nailed above the door frame, with two small black characters "17" engraved on it. Yaoxing knocked on the door three times, and the door opened from the inside. Haiquan saw that there were already four or five people sitting inside. He had met two of them the previous two nights. He did not recognize three of them. He saw that the leader, Chen Huamin, had not yet arrived.</p>
<p>Thirty</p>
<p>Haiquan saw that the famous writer Li Yixiang, whom he admired, was wearing a gray cloth cotton robe, with his hands crossed into his sleeves, walking up and down the room, sometimes shaking his head, as if he was thinking about some kind of philosophy. He hurried up, respectfully called out Mr. Li, and then stretched out his right hand, asking to shake hands. Haiquan intentionally showed off to the two young people who came with him, showing that he knew the great writer Li Yixiang.</p>
<p>"Ah, Mr. Lin. You, you, why are you only coming now? You, you, young people, should be, be, be here earlier than, than, than us old predecessors!"</p>
<p>Although Li Yixiang gave Haiquan a lecture in an old-fashioned manner, he still shook hands with him warmly. After Haiquan shook hands with Li Yixiang, he went to ask the two young people he didn't recognize. He saw that one was dark-skinned, with a body as long and thin as a crane, and purple-black lips. Haiquan thought, this person must be smoking opium. The other was short, with hair more than a foot long, draped behind him. Haiquan thought, this is the characteristic of an artist.</p>
<p>After Haiquan displayed his social skills for a while, he retreated and sat next to Yaoxing, just about to ask Yaoxing why Chen Huamin hadn't come yet. But Yaoxing, without waiting for him to open his mouth, smiled and said to him:</p>
<p>"Why do you always put on such a pedantic appearance, like a pig dragging a dog!..."</p>
<p>Although Yaoxing was joking, he spoke loudly and aggressively. Haiquan blushed, secretly hating Tang Yaoxing's meanness. So he remembered what Mr. Zhu Weidao had said to him in the bus this morning.</p>
<p>"Old Tang, I heard you are going to have a conflict, Mr. Zhu Weidao, is that right?"</p>
<p>"Who said that?"</p>

<p>(Beiping) Yesterday afternoon, Yu Pass saw an increase of four to five hundred Japanese soldiers, a combined force of infantry and artillery. There seems to be a continuous stream of reinforcements. A column of enemy armored vehicles has already advanced to Shihe to assist their infantry and cavalry in combat. According to Someya, the Japanese garrison commander on Qin Island, the Japanese military, having suffered defeats in battles at various passes along the Great Wall, intends to change its operational plan and attack Luodong. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A Japanese Kwantung Army aircraft flew over Qin Island, dropping a communication to the Japanese camp. The content demanded that our army withdraw from the defensive structures at Shimen Village and Qin Island. Our battalion commander stationed on Qin Island, Liu Zhenying, has decided to ignore the demand and is actively preparing to resist. He has also requested that Mr. Chilton, a Briton, take note that the Japanese military should be responsible for all future losses in the war. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Foreign dispatch: Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations has emboldened militarist arrogance. Many young officers of the Kwantung Army advocate for military action against Beiping and Tianjin, taking decisive measures and actively advancing troops. Key figures in the Japanese government have repeatedly issued wild pronouncements, vigorously promoting the theory of East Asian co-existence and co-prosperity, a change from the past pro-China-Japan rhetoric. They use this as an excuse to support a puppet state, hoping to conceal their intentions from international scrutiny. However, the Japanese government, parties, and business circles oppose the Japanese military entering the Guan region. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yesterday morning, a certain unit of our army launched a counterattack and occupied the enemy position at Huimazhai, east of Shihe, killing over ten enemy soldiers. The enemy, unable to withstand the attack, retreated to Jiaoshan. Our army recaptured Huimazhai, seizing several enemy rifles and a large quantity of ammunition. Our army suffered five or six casualties. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Kaiping Dispatch: At approximately 1:00 AM on the 29th, the enemy in front of Lengkou fiercely attacked the Xu battalion's position near Shanshen Temple, launching seven or eight assaults. Our army calmly met the attack, and the enemy was routed, suffering heavy casualties. Under the cover of firepower, they transported their corpses. We captured several bodies, as well as rifles, helmets, and other items, which are currently being inventoried. Our army suffered minor casualties and continues to hold the original position. On the same morning, several enemy aircraft dropped over ten bombs near our position, causing no damage. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a certain military expert, the recent lull at various passes and the sudden increase in tension on the eastern front suggest that the enemy's intentions have shifted to encompass the entirety of North China. They aim to attack Qin Island and Yuluo to the east, and invade Chahar province to the west, creating a large encirclement targeting our area south of the Yellow River. Their first-stage military operations are north of the Great Wall, and the second stage are north of the Yellow River. This is evident from the military maps found on captured enemy soldiers by Song's forces. Now, their second-stage military operations have been launched against us, and our countrymen should be deeply alarmed. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Linyu) Since being ambushed and defeated by our army at Jiukou, the enemy has shown signs of increasing their numbers over the past few days, with frequent skirmishes between patrols from both sides. At approximately 6:00 AM on the 29th, about two hundred enemy soldiers, a mixed force of Japanese infantry, cavalry, and puppet troops, advanced from Shaguodian towards Qianshuiying. They were fiercely attacked by the defending soldiers of a certain regiment of our army. Simultaneously, a portion of a certain unit scaled the mountains to outflank the enemy, concentrating fire on them. The enemy gradually wavered. At approximately 7:00 AM, sixty to seventy enemy reinforcements moved towards our right flank from the Bai Guoshu heights, but our officers and soldiers calmly responded to the attack, using mortars and direct-fire artillery to engage them. By approximately 2:00 PM, over thirty Japanese soldiers rapidly advanced towards our position at Xiangshui, attempting to destroy our obstacles. They were met with intense fire from our army, suffering heavy casualties. The remaining enemy soldiers continued to resist in the area. By approximately 4:00 PM, the enemy at Qianshuiying could no longer withstand the attack and retreated along the entire line towards the Zhaojiayu area. Our army continues to hold the original position. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The fighting at Shimen Village has been fierce recently. The Japanese army dispatched a large unit from Yiyuan Pass as reinforcements, attempting to seize Shimen Village, leading to intense street fighting. The enemy first sent multiple bombers to indiscriminately drop bombs over Shimen Village and Qin Kong, many of which were incendiary bombs yesterday, causing most of the houses in the entire village to be destroyed by fire, with flames reaching the sky. Shimen Village will become the second Zhabei. (30th China United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) North China currently feels peaceful, and the sense of security is gradually returning. However, the Chinese authorities still enforce a curfew from 11:00 PM to 5:00 AM the next morning. This morning, it was announced that the fronts at Lengkou, Xifengkou, Gubeikou, and Shihe were quiet yesterday. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

(2) On the afternoon of the 28th, a hundred or so enemy plainclothes soldiers disrupted our positions at Xifengkou and were repelled by our guerrillas. (3) The enemy at Gushanzi outside Dongjiakou and the enemy outside Tiemenguan have been severely attacked by our troops for days and have been routed towards Pingquan, thanks to our plainclothes units circling behind them.

<p>Central Executive Committee Resolution</p>
<h3 id="e265">National Congress to be Held on July 1st <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>National Assembly to be decided by the National Congress</p>
<p>Committee Member Wang Resigns as Premier; Request Difficult to Approve</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei Issues Statement</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At 8:00 AM on the 30th, the Central Committee held its 64th Standing Committee meeting. Fifty-three people were in attendance, including Yu Youren, Ye Chucang, Ju Zheng, Wang Zhaoming, Chiang Kai-shek, Gu Mengyu, Sun Ke, and Chen Guofu. Chiang Kai-shek chaired the meeting, which resolved the following important cases:</p>
<p>(1) The case of the Standing Committee's request to hold an interim National Congress on July 1st, 22nd year of the Republic, was resolved and passed.</p>
<p>(2) It was resolved that the Standing Committee believes the National Assembly should be convened ahead of schedule. This case should be submitted to the interim National Congress for discussion and decision.</p>
<p>(3) It was resolved that Committee Member Wang Zhaoming's resignation from the concurrent position of Premier of the Executive Yuan is difficult to approve, and he should resume his duties immediately.</p>
<p>(4) Amendment to Article 1000 of the Regulations on Rewarding Overseas Chinese Patriotic Donations.</p>
<p>(5) Recommended Committee Member Wu Chaoshu to report at the Central Memorial Week next Monday.</p>
<p>(6) Other routine cases. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the adjournment of the Central Standing Committee meeting, Wang told reporters, "Today's Central Standing Committee meeting resolved to hold an interim National Congress on July 1st of this year. This case was proposed by all the Standing Committee members. According to the Party Constitution, the National Congress is held every two years. The Fourth National Congress was held on December 12th, 20th year of the Republic. The Fifth National Congress should be convened on November 12th of this year. However, the Third Plenary Session last December resolved to convene a National Political Council on October 10th of this year and a National Assembly in the 24th year of the Republic. If the National Assembly can be convened ahead of schedule, then there is no need to convene the National Political Council again. According to the Outline of National Reconstruction, local self-government should be completed before the National Assembly is convened. Currently, the date for the National Assembly is only a little over a year away. The government has a mountain of cases concerning the promotion of local self-government, but due to economic constraints, it cannot complete local self-government by the 24th year of the Republic. Therefore, all members of the Central Standing Committee believe that it is better to convene the National Assembly ahead of schedule. Whether the National Political Council should be convened as scheduled on October 10th of this year, or whether the National Assembly should be convened ahead of schedule this year, this matter must be decided by the National Congress. Furthermore, the legally mandated time for the Fifth National Congress is after the National Political Council. Therefore, today's Central Standing Committee resolved to convene an interim National Congress on July 1st to decide whether the National Political Council should be convened as scheduled, or whether the National Assembly should be convened ahead of schedule. As for whether the Fifth National Congress still needs to be held or whether it should be postponed, and whether the Central Committee members should be re-elected by the interim National Congress or by the Fifth National Congress, these will also be decided by the interim National Congress. In addition, the case of open governance proposed by Li Liejun has also been submitted to the interim National Congress for discussion. As for whether the Central Committee needs to hold a plenary meeting before the convening of the interim National Congress, this matter was also mentioned in today's Standing Committee meeting, and it was generally believed that there was no need to convene one."

<p>Plans to Hold Preliminary Negotiations with Russian Representative Litvinov in Geneva</p>
<p>War Debt Issue Becomes Focus of Discussion in London</p>
<p>Washington Dispatch: The opportunity for the United States to recognize the Soviet Union has been increasingly encouraged recently from all sides. It is rumored that the U.S. Disarmament Plenipotentiary Davis, who recently went to Europe, was tasked with holding preliminary negotiations with Russian representative Litvinov in Geneva regarding this issue. As for the form of recognition, it is currently unclear. It is likely that ambassadors will be exchanged first, or that temporary diplomatic representatives will be appointed first. (World Press)</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 29th: U.S. representative to the Disarmament Conference, Davis, arrived in London today. He will discuss the preliminary details of the World Economic Conference with British Prime Minister MacDonald and others at the end of this week. Next week, he will go to Geneva to attend the Disarmament Conference.</p>
<p>Havas, London, 29th: Since the arrival here of U.S. Disarmament Representative Davis, there has been much discussion, and the focus has shifted from politics to the war debt issue related to the World Economic Conference. Regarding the war debt issue, British Ambassador to the U.S., Lindsay, recently sent a report back to London, the contents of which are being kept secret by the Foreign Office. Tonight, parliamentary sources only stated that Roosevelt, given the attitude of the U.S. Congress, is unwilling to propose deferring the payment of war debts as they fall due. In view of this situation, it is generally hoped that a swift convening of the World Economic Conference may alleviate the current difficulties.</p>

<p>Will Germany Seek Compromise with Japan?</p>
<p>Berlin Dispatch: Regarding the issue of returning the South Pacific Islands, the German government will formally negotiate after the arrival of Japanese Ambassador to Germany, Nagai. Preliminary negotiations were recently held in secret by German Social Democratic Party leader and Minister of Propaganda Goebbels, Foreign Ministry Information Director Finke, Foreign Minister Loringberk, other diplomatic figures, and the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Fujii. According to reliable reports, the German side put forward the following views in the meeting: (1) Germany recognizes that the South Pacific Islands have no economic or colonial value for present-day Germany. (2) According to the Four-Power Pact proposed by MacDonald, the colonial issue will also come to the fore. In this context, the German National Socialist Party (Nazi Party) publicly advocates the return of Germany's former colonies, and the South Pacific issue will also be linked to it. (3) For the sake of appearances, Japan cannot return the South Pacific Islands to the Allies. It would be better to take the form of returning them to Germany. (4) The South Pacific Islands are of absolute military importance to Japan, which Germany fully understands. Therefore, Germany will not infringe on Japan's rights in the various facilities on the South Pacific Islands. (5) The two sides may be able to find a compromise whereby the South Pacific Islands are entrusted to Japan for military use in substance, while formally returning them to Germany.</p>
<p>Geneva Dispatch: According to general observation, the purpose of Germany's expression of demanding the return of the South Pacific Islands is merely to establish a principle for the return of former territories. Germany's true focus is not on the South Pacific Islands but on other former colonies. As for France, it opposes the return of the South Pacific Islands to Germany, as this would give Germany an excuse to expand its navy. (World Press)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The "Deutsche Tageszeitung" commented today on Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations and the status of the Pacific mandated islands, saying that Germany, in any case, does not wish to clash with Japan. It hopes that after open and friendly discussions, Japan's concerns can be dispelled and anti-German propaganda can be stopped. At the same time, Germans must deny that the mandated islands are genuine spoils of war from former enemies and insist that the League of Nations has the right to supervise the legal status of the mandated territories.

<p>(Harbin) The Soviet Union has a plan to build a railway through Manchuria via Manzhouli. Morita, the Manchukuo Minister of Transportation, arrived in Harbin a few days ago and pointed out the illegality of this move by the Soviet Union, requesting that it be stopped. The Soviet Union has not shown any sincerity. The Manchukuo government has decided that if the Soviet Union continues this behavior in the future, it will take appropriate measures. On the 28th, Soviet employees attempted to transport all locomotives on the Chinese Eastern Railway into Russian territory under cover of darkness in Manzhouli. This was discovered and stopped by Manchukuo. Therefore, Russian-Manchukuo relations, centered on the railway issue, are gradually deteriorating. (30th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>

<p>League of Nations Indulges Japan</p>
<p>Demonstrates Failure in Duty</p>
<p>(London) Viscountess Cryston, who recently returned from a tour of the Far East, held a meeting at the Capital Club this afternoon to lecture on her observations in the Far East. Many British Chinese and prominent figures from the British Liberal Party attended the meeting. The Viscountess recounted the course of the Sino-Japanese dispute, and then said loudly, "Japan has violated the League of Nations Covenant, destroyed the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Washington Nine-Power Treaty. This is the consensus of the Lytton Commission and the League of Nations General Assembly, and not my personal opinion." The Viscountess also said, "The League of Nations had the opportunity to put pressure on Japan, but it lightly let it go, doing nothing, which is a failure in its duty. However, Japan is still slightly restrained by a judgment from the League of Nations. Otherwise, the Japanese would have marched south of the Great Wall, and other powers would have secretly colluded to dispose of China, just like the events of thirty years ago." Therefore, the Viscountess concluded that the League of Nations in Geneva is a manifestation of the main principles of British liberalism in the international arena, which we should enthusiastically support.

<h3 id="e271">Japanese Ships Suspend Service One After Another <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>Affected by Anti-Japanese Sentiment</p>
<p>The Osaka Asahi Shimbun reported on the 24th that since the anti-Japanese movement in various parts of China, the shipping business of Japanese ships has been declining daily. Vessels connecting central and northern China, such as the Dalian Kisen Kaisha's Tianjin Maru, which departed from Shanghai on March 5th, and the Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha's Shirozaki Maru, which departed from Tianjin on March 10th, were the last routes. In the future, these routes will inevitably be monopolized by the British Taikoo Company, the British Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. In short, due to the anti-Japanese movement, Japanese ships have repeatedly suspended service, hindering business, which is regrettable. However, the situation in the Chinese interior is comparatively different. For example, in Shandong, due to negotiations with local officials, anti-Japanese sentiment is outwardly promoted, but it has not been affected in any way in reality. Transactions are still carried out as usual, so imports of Japanese goods have been quite prosperous for a time. However, trade in the Tianjin and Beiping areas has been relatively sluggish recently.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun reported on the 22nd that Hengtake Heita郎, the Commercial Counselor stationed in China, returned to Japan this time to discuss important matters. He arrived in Nagasaki on the Shanghai Maru on the 31st and made the following remarks on the situation of Chinese trade: "The boycott of Japanese goods is still ongoing. However, practical commodities, no matter how suppressed, have gradually opened up their position. Foreigners who do not handle Japanese goods also need more and more Japanese goods. Recently, two large-scale Japanese department stores have been opened in the French Concession. By changing the packaging style and brand, the sales performance is excellent. As for the anti-Japanese sentiment of the Chinese people, it cannot be changed in a day or two, so we should make special efforts in this regard."</p>

<p>(Yingkou) The Taikoo Company's Nanchang, which was anchored outside Niuzhuang Port at noon today waiting for a pilot, was approached by several pirates in three small boats, who suddenly opened fire on the ship. Fourteen pirates boarded the ship. At that time, four crew members were chatting idly in the main dining room. Caught off guard, they were taken into a small boat and carried off to the northwest. All four abducted crew members were British: one was Second Engineer Bairu, one was Third Engineer Peirce, one was Johnson, and one was Hargrave. The latter two were junior crew members. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Yingkou) The Nanchang's four crew members were subdued by pirates with pistols, who had them bound and thrown into a small boat. Captain Law-Pinson rushed to the radio room to send an alert, but the radio operator was not in the room. He returned to his cabin to get a weapon, but by that time the pirates had already taken the four crew members far away. The pirates' small boat escaped into shallow water, so the steamer, which drew more water, could not follow. A British gunboat has now joined the search for the pirates' small boat. The British Vice-Consul in Shenyang, Clarke, who previously handled the cases of Paulaire and Kirkland being abducted, came to Niuzhuang after hearing the alarm. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Boycott Movement Spreads Nationwide</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 29th: Prime Minister Hitler stated in today's cabinet meeting that he would implement a boycott against Jews on April 1st. According to news from London, an organized movement to boycott German goods is underway there. Jews in New York are also working hard to incite all kinds of Americans. When the National Socialist Party announces the implementation of the boycott against Jews, the German government will implement countermeasures to avoid acts of violence. Overseas Jews should know that if Jews wage war against Germany, the German Jews will suffer the most. German Jews are naturally trembling at the boycott on April 1st and are trying their best to get it cancelled. This boycott will leave tens of thousands of Jews in ruin and will leave hundreds of thousands of Christians who serve Jews in a difficult position. Therefore, the people of Germany now hope that the "propaganda of abuse" made overseas will be stopped immediately, and then the National Socialist Party can cancel the boycott. Hitler did not say that the entire German government did not approve of this move, and of course major bankers did not support it either. The boycott against Jews began today and is rapidly spreading throughout the country.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 29th: Since the National Socialist Party issued a proclamation calling for a boycott of Jews, a Central Boycott Committee has been established here to investigate the addresses of Jewish merchants, doctors, and lawyers, and to specify the types of goods that should be boycotted. This boycott is expected to be implemented in an organized manner throughout Germany starting on Saturday. The boycott has already begun in many places. In the city of Münster in Westphalia, members of the National Socialist Party are guarding the doors of 48 Jewish shops and occupying the court, expelling all Jewish lawyers. In the city of Dortmund, under the pretext of protection, a large number of Jews were arrested. In the city of Görlitz, members of the National Socialist Party are guarding the entrance to the court, carrying out inspections. The presiding judge, two lawyers, and many others were arrested and will be imprisoned. The mayor of Frankfurt am Main has ordered that all Jewish civil servants in the municipal government be dismissed. However, there have been no bloodshed incidents in any place.</p>

When the police entered a certain Communist's home, they found a large number of poisons, chemical equipment, and explosives. This poison must have been prepared to be mixed into the food cooked in the kitchens of the Nazi troops, and its power was enough to poison the entire army. Fifteen Communists have now been arrested, including six leaders. Today, several Jewish lawyers were arrested in Frankfurt am Main, including the famous Frankfurt University professor Dr. Zinshimer, who belonged to the Socialist Party and previously served as the Frankfurt police chief.

<p>Famine Throughout Kazakhstan</p>
<p>Report of a British Man's Visit to Russia</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 29th: Mr. Kennet, the former political secretary of Lloyd George, has returned to England after walking and inspecting Soviet Russia. He has now arrived in Berlin. According to him, there is currently a widespread famine in Soviet Russia, just like the great famine of 1921. Millions of people have already died of starvation alone. There are cries of "We have no bread and will starve to death" everywhere in Soviet Russia. It is said that one million people have starved to death in the Kazakhstan region, because there is not enough seed there, and most of the farmers are too weak to plow. Kennet believes that the cause of the famine is due to farmers resisting the government's collectivization of land, and the lack of skilled workers and the collapse of economic transportation. Kennet also said that the case of the six British engineers arrested by the Vickers Electrical Company and the shooting of 35 farmer leaders were all actions to appease the people. Previously, Kennet had expressed sympathy for the Soviet Union's experiments and had spent six years inspecting various parts of the Soviet Union. It is shocking to hear him suddenly give such a report about Soviet Russia.</p>

<p>Wreckage of British Airplane</p>
<h3 id="e293">The Tragedy of the Victims <a href="#e293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Dixmuide, 29th - The British airplane "City of Liverpool," deeply embedded in the soil with smoldering remains, was being excavated by workers all day today to a depth reaching the waist, in order to retrieve the remains of the thirteen victims. The work proceeded slowly. Initially, it was anticipated that only five bodies could be transferred to the coroner's office today, but by evening, all thirteen terribly gruesome bodies had been exhumed and identified. Three bodies were missing their heads, and two had their arms intertwined. After the bodies were removed, three French airplanes flew over the crash site and dropped wreaths. According to reports, the "City of Liverpool" carried a total of fifteen people, including thirteen passengers and two crew members. Shortly after flying into Belgian territory, the plane suddenly caught fire, and everyone on board perished. However, two people were farther from the plane's wreckage, likely having jumped out before the fuselage landed. Among the fifteen victims, eleven were British, three were German, and one was Belgian.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 29th - Sir Sassoon, Under-Secretary of State for Air, stated in the House of Commons today that all seats on today's flight to Paris were fully booked, and many people who bought tickets were unable to get on. This proves that yesterday's crash of the "City of Liverpool" in Belgium has not shaken public confidence in Imperial Airways. Regarding news of the "City of Liverpool" crash, no further reports are available at this time. However, it should be noted that Imperial Airways airplanes have not had an accident in two and a half years, during which they have flown four million miles and carried 99,000 passengers. Airplanes of the "City of Liverpool" type have been commonly used for the past six years.</p>

<p>Rejected by International Oil Conference</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 29th - The International Oil Conference today rejected Romania's request to increase its oil production quota. American members today continued to allow them to control the production of independent oil companies. Therefore, it is expected that if the production of American independent oil companies increases, they will reduce their production. As a result, Romania will naturally accept a reasonable and minor continued reduction. Romania's current production is 18,500 tons per day, previously 24,000 tons. During the conference in December last year, after repeated persuasion, they agreed to reduce to the current figure.</p>

The court recognized that the motive for his crime was the result of national indignation, and therefore imposed a lenient punishment.</p>
<h3 id="e296">The Japanese Collapse Theory in the Eyes of the British (Continued) <a href="#e296" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c296" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">296</a></h3>
<p>Translated from the Manchester Guardian</p>
<p>The possibility of controlling the Japanese yen by reducing imports and increasing exports is very weak. This is a continuous cycle, and inflation is therefore more certain. The extent of inflation depends on the government's ability to raise funds from the people or banks. Judging from the financial strength of various commercial banks, there is still some collateral for borrowing. Japan is indeed willing to make great sacrifices for the sake of invading other countries and imperialist expansion. Even so, the budget situation and the deficit in foreign exchange balance will probably be worse in the coming months than before. Without foreign economic assistance, it will be difficult for Japan to maintain its current military spending.</p>
<p>Since around July of last year, inflation has been evident, such as rising prices, inconsistencies in the fluctuations of various commodity prices, a further sharp decline in the exchange rate of the Japanese yen, and a significant increase in the cost of living. The general wholesale price index has increased by more than 15 percent in the last three months, while the retail price index has increased by 6 percent. The Bank of Japan's cost-of-living index increased by 7.5 percent between July and October. Wages do not seem to have increased, but there are no recent statistics available. If the price of rice had not fallen sharply due to an unprecedented bumper harvest since March 1932, the cost of living would undoubtedly have increased much more. However, although the price of rice fell by 20 percent between February and October, the price of wheat rose by 35 percent, the price of cotton yarn rose by 55 percent, the price of steel rose by more than 50 percent, and the price of raw silk rose by 90 percent from its lowest point in June to October, half of which was due to the poor silk cocoon harvest. The number of registered unemployed was 439,000 in October 1931 and increased to 482,000 in June 1932. This is the last survey result, but it may decrease afterward, because in recent months, industry and commerce have been temporarily encouraged and seduced by inflation.</p>
<p>Cotton yarn exports in September of last year were 3.1 percent higher than in October 1931, cotton fabric production was 7.9 percent higher, and silk fabric (including rayon) production was 31.2 percent higher. However, the increase in overall industrial production (twelve main commodities) was only about 2.5 percent, because the production of other commodities was low. The fall in the price of rice has greatly affected farmers who are already heavily in debt. Although the Japanese Parliament decided in September to allocate relief funds of about 300 million yen annually, only one-third of this money will reach the hands of farmers. The rest is designated for the relief of the Central and local Industrial Banks. The position of the local Industrial Banks is very unstable, and private commercial banks also have a strong exterior but weak interior. Both deposits and loans, especially the investment portion of loans, have continued to decline since September 1931. This tense situation was temporarily eased in the first half of 1932 after the abandonment of the gold standard, and the issuance of cash in proportion to debt repayment can still stabilize people's minds.</p>
<p>Export-Import Gap</p>
<p>In the first nine months of 1932, the total value of Japanese (including Korea, Taiwan, and Ryukyu) imports was approximately 1,005.4 million yen, excluding fractions, while the total value of exports was approximately 938 million yen. Compared to the same period in 1931, the total value of imports increased by 89 million, and the total value of exports increased by 49 million. Therefore, the visible trade deficit increased from 76 million to 116 million. However, these increased figures are all virtual, and are actually due to the depreciation of the Japanese yen. Calculated in gold prices, the total value of imports in the first nine months of 1931 was US$51.2 million, which fell to US$33.9 million in the same period of 1932, while the total value of exports fell from US$45.4 million to US$29.2 million. Therefore, the visible trade deficit fell from US$5.8 million to US$4.7 million. The export volume of cotton fabrics has greatly increased, almost doubling in 1932. However, the average export price of cotton fabrics, calculated in gold prices, was US$106 per thousand yards in 1929 (equivalent to 230 yen), which fell to US$35 (equivalent to 147 yen) by last September, a decrease of almost two-thirds. This shows that the reduction in commodity prices is partly the result of Japanese commodity dumping, because when the price of the Japanese yen fell sharply, the gold price of Japanese cotton goods fell more than that of other countries. During the same period, the export price of cotton fabrics from the British Commonwealth, calculated in gold prices, fell by less than 50 percent.</p>
<p>Regarding the latest figures for the export-import gap, visible and invisible, it is difficult to obtain them, but based on logical deduction, there are fears of an unfavorable panic soon. The price of Japanese bonds in foreign markets has been sluggish for several months, which is a sign of this concern. In the last three months of 1932, there may be some major changes in the visible export-import gap. The first step of the expansionary policy may encourage exports more than imports, and it is natural that Japan's foreign trade will have a favorable visible gap in the second half of last year.</p>
<p>Unfavorable Main Reasons</p>
<p>However, contrary to this possibility, there are several other main reasons, which will be briefly discussed. These include the increase in external debt calculated in foreign currency and the increase in interest payments in Japanese yen, which will definitely be a heavy blow to the budget. The reduction in income from Japanese investment in Manchuria and other parts of China, the reduction in profits from shipping and tourism to Japan, the huge military spending and Japanese diplomatic expenses abroad, the reduction in borrowing long-term or short-term capital from foreign countries, and continued investment in Manchuria, the number of gold reserves is extremely small, requiring great difficulty to transport goods again. The Bank of Japan's gold reserves were 83.1 million yen at the end of January 1931, and 81.7 million at the end of September of the same year. Since then, gold reserves have decreased, reaching only 42.8 million yen by the end of November last year.</p>
<p>Moreover, although the development of manufacturing industry will definitely continue due to the increase in exports, there are also restrictions. Because of currency depreciation, in terms of cost, more Japanese yen can be obtained when selling, but imported raw materials must be paid for with depreciated Japanese yen. This benefit is limited by this fact. Therefore, the net profit, in addition to the further depreciation of the Japanese yen from the time of import to the time of export, lies in the difference between the domestic production cost (such as interest and wages) and the amount of Japanese yen obtained at the time of sale. When the increasing cost of living forces wages to rise, this difference will disappear.</p>
<p>Two new gold producing areas have indeed been discovered in Japan, and have recently attracted attention from certain parties. These two places are actually placer gold producing areas, and their locations have become famous for a while, and may not provide much help to the improvement of Japan's financial situation. Based on the facts mentioned above regarding Japan's financial and economic situation, it can be known that it is difficult for Japan to stand in a position of confrontation with the rest of the world, and it is also ineffective to seek understanding from European powers for intervention in the Manchurian Incident.</p>

<p>Discussing His Inspection of the Northern Front Lines and</p>
<p>Stating His Willingness to Undertake Anti-Japanese Work</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang to Visit Shanghai in the Middle of the 1st and 2nd</p>
<p>Kong Xiangxi, Special Envoy for the Inspection of European and American Industries, returned to the country from Europe and immediately reported his findings to the Central Government in Nanjing. He then went north to Beiping and Tianjin, and to Xifengkou to comfort the anti-Japanese soldiers led by Song Zheyuan and others. He also went to Baoding to meet with Chiang, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission. He returned south a few days ago, arriving in Shanghai this morning at 8:00 AM on the overnight train from Nanjing, accompanied by his wife, Madame Soong Ai-ling. According to Kong this morning speaking to reporters of this newspaper, Chiang Kai-shek is scheduled to visit Shanghai around the 1st or 2nd of the month. Today, due to other important official business in Nanjing, he may not have time to leave. Regarding the requests from various parties to appoint Chiang as Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, Kong believes that under the current circumstances, it is necessary to establish such a position in order to unify military power and facilitate command. His remarks are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e298">Inspection of Xifengkou <a href="#e298" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c298" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">298</a></h3>
<p>Kong stated first that, on this trip north to meet with Chairman Chiang, he made a special trip to Xifengkou to inspect the front lines of our army and comfort the anti-Japanese soldiers led by Song Zheyuan and others. He repeatedly met with generals such as Song Zheyuan and Pang Bingxun. The defensive works of our army are exceptionally solid, and morale is extremely high. Regarding food and equipment, the Central Government is providing as much assistance as possible, so there is no need to worry about shortages. Currently, the military situation in Xifengkou is in a stalemate. Song Zheyuan's troops and others are bravely fighting the enemy, and their contributions are extremely significant. Our side has also suffered heavy casualties.</p>
<h3 id="e299">Japanese Air of Appeasement <a href="#e299" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c299" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">299</a></h3>
<p>Kong continued, stating that after each military action, the Japanese are sure to spread various rumors in an attempt to soften the atmosphere. In reality, this is entirely a deceptive tactic. Their ambition to gain an inch and then seek a mile has never changed. In the future, they will undoubtedly resume their ferocious face and plot a large-scale invasion again. There is absolutely no doubt about this. The Central Government has made thorough preparations for the military situation in North China and is determined to fight the enemy to the end. Rumors of compromise and direct negotiations with Japan are completely unfounded. In today's situation, compromising with Japan is an act of either being insane or devoid of conscience.</p>
<h3 id="e300">Chairman Chiang's Visit to Shanghai <a href="#e300" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c300" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">300</a></h3>
<p>Kong added that after returning to Nanjing, he repeatedly met with Chairman Chiang. He heard that Chiang would visit Shanghai around the 1st or 2nd of the month, and then go north again to oversee the situation. However, due to other important official business in Nanjing today, he may not have time to come here. It has not yet been decided whether he will travel by train or airplane. As for Zhang Xueliang in Shanghai, he heard that he has recently been suffering from a minor illness. He plans to visit him soon.</p>
<h3 id="e301">Issue of Commander-in-Chief <a href="#e301" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c301" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">301</a></h3>
<p>Reporters immediately inquired about the widespread telegrams to the government from various sectors, requesting the appointment of Chairman Chiang as Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, asking whether this could be realized. Kong replied that he had not returned to the country for long and did not know the specifics of this case. However, speaking not from a personal viewpoint, under today's circumstances, in order to unify military power and facilitate command, it is necessary to establish a Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force.</p>
<h3 id="e302">Undertaking Anti-Japanese Work <a href="#e302" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c302" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">302</a></h3>
<p>Kong also stated that he is currently organizing the findings of his recent inspection in Europe and America. He will make them public in their entirety in the future. Reporters then asked whether he would continue to be responsible for the work of revitalizing industry and commerce. He replied that in today's perilous national situation, when we are teetering on the brink of disaster, talking about revitalizing industry is too slow to be of immediate help. He is extremely willing to undertake anti-Japanese work and fulfill his responsibility as a citizen to save the country.</p>
<h3 id="e303">Opposition to Dictatorship <a href="#e303" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c303" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">303</a></h3>
<p>Finally, regarding the issue of dictatorship, reporters asked whether today's China, like Germany under Hitler and Italy under Mussolini, could be revived through dictatorship. Kong replied that China's problem today is not one of system, but of people. Dictatorship is good, but who can implement it? There are many different opinions, and government orders are inconsistent. The rise of a thing, arguments arise, all doing work on the text, and very little is seen in facts. He sincerely hopes that the people of the country will unite and work hard to resist foreign aggression, otherwise the country will perish imminently, and what system can be discussed? Kong expressed his feelings with great emotion.</p>

<p>Industrial and Railway Exhibition Held Simultaneously</p>
<p>The 37th anniversary of National Jiaotong University, the Industrial and Railway Exhibition held this morning at the Wen Zhi Hall opening ceremony, and simultaneously also hold the Engineering Hall opening ceremony, Rong Hong Hall Completion Ceremony, starting at 9 o'clock, until noon before scattering, now will be the circumstances described below,</p>
<h3 id="e305">Representatives and Guests <a href="#e305" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c305" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">305</a></h3>
<p>Starting at 9 o'clock this morning, Consuls from various countries, government representatives, representatives from various schools, and Chinese and foreign guests arrived at the school one after another to visit and participate in various ceremonies. These included German Acting Consul-General in Shanghai, Beinert, Vice-Consul Moore, Swedish Consul-General Lalan, National Government and Shanghai Municipal Government representative Yu Hongjun, Railway Department Minister Gu's representative Xia Guangyu, Industry Department representative Liu Yinfol, Education Department Minister Zhu's representative Wu Shuwei, former Deputy Minister of Industry Zhao Jinqing, Municipal Education Bureau Director Pan Gongzhan, Municipal Public Works Bureau Director Xu Peihuang, Jiangsu Provincial Government representative Xu Xingcheng, Songhu Garrison Headquarters representative Xu Yiheng, Naval Training Ship Staff Officer Wu Guanghai, Public Security Bureau representative Huang Zuna, Beiping Railway Administration Zeng Zhaoyi, Two Roads Bureau Traffic Department Director Zheng Baozhao, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau Fan Shouzhi, Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureau Cheng Kaogang, Shanghai Law College Chu Fucheng, Nanjing Central University Liu Qifeng, and Tongji University Weng Zilong, among hundreds of others.</p>
<h3 id="e306">Engineering Hall Opening <a href="#e306" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c306" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">306</a></h3>
<p>The Engineering Hall opening ceremony was held at 9:00 AM in front of the Engineering Hall. First, Dean Li gave a report, stating in brief that the construction of the Engineering Hall was proposed in the 15th year of the Republic, raising only 30,000 yuan in construction funds. It was delayed until the 19th year, when Railway Minister Sun Zhesheng, who headed the school, enthusiastically promoted industrial construction, and the old proposal was brought up again and actively carried out. Construction began in February of the 20th year and was completed at the end of the year. The entire hall occupies an area of 4,200 square feet, with a volume of 42,000 cubic feet, divided into two floors. The lower floor is for laboratories and factories, and the upper floor is for research, surveying, and classrooms. In the future, if expansion is needed, another floor can be added on top, as this was prepared for during the design and construction. After the report, architect Wu handed over the key and wished for engineering progress and industrial development. Dean Hu received the key and unlocked it. Dean Zhang continued to speak, saying that he was deeply gratified that the hall had been completed through the efforts of President Li. Looking back on the school's founding, it has focused on civil engineering from the beginning, but all the equipment was very rudimentary. Two or three years later, a flat roof was added to the existing electrical machinery factory and instruments were added, which was the beginning of the electrical engineering hall. Over the decades, various equipment has been added, but it is far inferior to today. However, successive graduates have either served in government agencies, working on political, transport and other work, or have used their own experience to start industries, all with outstanding achievements. Even in this exhibition, the diesel engine of Xinzhong Engineering Company, the transformer of Yizhong Electrical Machinery Company, and the radio equipment of Wireless Research Company and Sanji Rui Electrical Company are all the result of the efforts of the school's alumni. Now that we have such superior equipment, we should redouble our efforts. England's Grans Building Laboratory, which was established in 1915, led to the invention of the steam engine, the ancestor of today's prime movers. The Royal School of England built the Taytes Laboratory, which led to Faraday's discovery of electromagnetic induction in 1831. Therefore, I have endless hopes for the completion of the Engineering Hall.</p>
<h3 id="e307">Rong Hong Hall Completed <a href="#e307" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c307" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">307</a></h3>
<p>The Rong Hong Hall completion ceremony was held at 9:30 AM in front of the Rong Hong Hall. First, Dean Zhao gave a report, saying that in recent years, the number of courses has increased, and the number of students has also increased, resulting in insufficient allocation of school buildings. When Sun was president of the school, he had a five-year and ten-year plan, and the construction of Rong Hong Hall was also part of the plan. Solicitation began in July of last year, bidding in August, and construction began in September, and it was completed in March of this year. The entire hall occupies an area of 1,949 square feet and has three floors, used as offices for the management department. After the report, architect Zhuang assisted the key and wished for the development of school affairs and the prosperity of the country. Engineer Rong received the key and unlocked it, and then President Li gave a speech, saying that the school's building was to commemorate the worthy predecessor Rong Hong, so not only to leave a memorial in material terms, but also to get a good lesson in spirit. A hundred years ago, Rong Hong advocated innovation and suggested ten items to Li Hongzhang. The creation of the school is also due to this, and the 120 students who were sent abroad at that time made a great contribution to the reform-minded China in the decades that followed. Rong Hong's vision and advocacy were all based on patriotism. We built this Rong Hong Hall to commemorate him, hoping that students will work hard to complete his unfinished will.</p>
<h3 id="e308">Exhibition Opens <a href="#e308" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c308" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">308</a></h3>
<p>The opening ceremony of the Industrial and Railway Exhibition was held at the Wen Zhi Hall at 10:00 AM. First, Hu Ruixing, director of the preparatory committee, gave a report, saying that the school has had large-scale exhibitions twice. The first time was in the 5th year of the Republic, when the school celebrated its 20th anniversary, and the second time was when the school celebrated its 30th anniversary. In the 35th year of the Republic two years ago, the Industrial and Railway Exhibition was planned, but due to the 918 and 128 incidents, the national crisis suddenly arose, so it was postponed. At the end of last year, preparations were started again, and after many meetings in April, it was finally able to open, which is very gratifying. The exhibition is also divided into two types: Type A, which is given by various parties, and Type B, which is displayed. There are 12 exhibitors in the railway, 60 manufacturers, 9 schools, and 6 agencies. Foreign manufacturers include 33 from the United Kingdom, 28 from Germany, 26 from Belgium, 14 from the United States, 14 from Switzerland, 7 from France, 4 from Italy, 3 from Canada, and 1 each from Sweden, Hungary, Denmark, Russia, and the Netherlands. Xia Guangyu, representative of the Railway Department Minister Gu, said in his speech that Jiaotong University is well-managed, well-equipped, and has been expanded and improved by successive presidents. The talents it has cultivated have all served in society and have achieved excellent results. Therefore, it occupies an important position in the process of building a new China. The significance of the Industrial and Railway Exhibition is also very significant: (1) To provide an opportunity for the study of academic theory and the needs of practice to be explored, and to make a comparison of domestic and foreign industries; (2) To arouse the attention of the Chinese people to industry. In today's country, if we want to survive, we must work hard to build it. Therefore, the strength of the country depends on the thickness of the national production capacity. Since the rise of the machine industry, industry has been trending towards the end, but our country still does not pay attention to the construction of industry. This is also an important reason why the country is getting weaker day by day. Although various raw materials can be produced by ourselves, the Industrial and Railway Exhibition cannot be manufactured, so it is important to promote the attention of the Chinese people, especially during this national crisis. Yu Hongjun, representative of the National Government and the Municipal Government, gave a speech, saying that Jiaotong University has a glorious history, great achievements, and has made even greater contributions to the new construction. Holding the Industrial and Railway Exhibition during the current national crisis has great significance. The weakness of our country's industry, commerce, and transportation is one of the reasons. The reason for the underdevelopment of industry lies in the fact that the Chinese people do not pay attention to scientific management. Some people even think that imitating the 19th-century British efforts in domestic industry can also develop. Sun Yat-sen's instruction, capital is machinery, shows that large-scale production using machinery is not enough to talk about industry. Therefore, this exhibition, in addition to making the Chinese people aware of machinery, also hopes to emphasize the significance of scientific management. Then Education Department representative Wu Shuwei and others gave speeches, and it did not end until noon.</p>

<p>Post Office Announcement</p>
<h3 id="e311">Returning Savings from the Liaoning Area <a href="#e311" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c311" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">311</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau has issued an announcement this morning regarding the return of fixed deposit receipts from the Liaoning area:</p>
<p>Announcement: It has been verified that all depositors within the territory of the three northeastern provinces who hold savings books or fixed deposit receipts issued by various bureaus in the Liaoning postal area before July 23, 1932, and in the Jilin-Heilongjiang postal area before July 25, 1932, must register with the bureau in person or through their agent. The registration methods are detailed below:</p>
<p>(1) Savings books for passbook savings can be registered at any post office (excluding branches) within the country that handles passbook savings. Fixed deposit receipts for fixed deposits should be registered at post offices (excluding branches) that handle fixed deposits.</p>
<p>(2) If the depositor intends to leave the savings in the post office, a new savings book or new fixed deposit receipt will be issued by the registering post office one month after the registration date. For savings originally deposited in Harbin dollars in the Jilin-Heilongjiang postal area—that is, if the savings book or deposit receipt does not specify silver dollars—they will be converted into silver dollars at 80% of their value. Interest on these retained savings will be calculated from the day after the last day of interest calculation in the three northeastern provinces (i.e., June 30, 1932). Interest on fixed deposits will be calculated from the original deposit date at the original interest rate.</p>
<p>(3) If the depositor wishes to withdraw these savings, they must also wait one month from the registration date and then, following usual procedures, submit a withdrawal slip to the original registering bureau, along with the savings book or fixed deposit receipt, to withdraw the savings.

<h3 id="e312">Expanding Agricultural Cooperation Experiment Zone <a href="#e312" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c312" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">312</a></h3>
<p>Adding Pengpu and Jiangwan Districts</p>
<p>The agricultural cooperation experiment zone established by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau in recent years has achieved remarkable results and is well-received by farmers. Last year, due to the war, the Yinheng, Zhenru, and Pusong districts could not be implemented. The bureau has recently drafted an expansion plan. In addition to restoring the Yinheng, Zhenru, and Pusong districts, it will also add the Pengpu and Jiangwan districts. The general situation of the experiment zone last year and the expansion plan for the 21st year are recorded below:</p>
<p>Last Year’s Harvest in Each District Last year, the experiment zone established by the bureau included Yangsi, Luhang, Caojing, Gaohang, Fahua, Tangqiao, and Yangjing districts. The Yangsi district was divided into 18 units, with a total harvest of 5,790 catties. The Luhang district was divided into 12 units, with a total harvest of 6,550 catties. The Caojing district was divided into 6 units, with a total harvest of 2,383 catties. The Gaohang district was divided into 6 units, with a total harvest of 2,415 catties. The Fahua district was divided into 6 units, with a total harvest of 1,552 catties. The Tangqiao district had 12 units, with a total harvest of 6,505 catties. The Yangjing district was divided into 6 units, with a total harvest of 2,265 catties.</p>
<p>Plan for the 21st Year The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau’s agricultural cooperation experiment zone plan for the 21st year:</p>
<p>(1) Location: In addition to the seven districts of Luhang, Yangsi, Tangqiao, Caojing, Gaohang, Fahua, and Yangjing, which should be implemented successively, the Yinheng, Zhenru, and Pusong districts should also be restored to achieve results. Furthermore, the Pengpu and Jiangwan districts should be added to promote popularization.</p>
<p>(2) Organization: The bureau will entrust municipal committee members and farmers' associations in each district to select excellent local farmers and establish units in appropriate locations. The farmers will be responsible for management and will be guided and supervised by the bureau, the municipal committees in each district, and the farmers' associations. A supervisor may be hired as needed, but without salary.</p>
<p>(3) Facilities: This year, the experiment will still be limited to cotton cultivation. Twelve units will be established in the Xuhang, Yangsi, and Tangqiao districts, divided into two zones. The remaining nine districts will each have six units, for a total of ninety units.</p>
<p>(4) Subsidies: Each unit is allocated five mu of level land, with an experimental fee of three silver dollars per mu. Each district will also receive a supervisor's travel allowance of forty-five yuan and a seed fee of fifteen yuan.</p>

<p>Gui Bao, the thirteen-year-old daughter of Wang Le, a Ningbo woman residing at No. 46 Zhaofeng Road, was studying in the evening class at the nearby Muyi Christian School for two hours. On the afternoon of December 21st last year, at 7:00 PM, she went to the school to study but never returned. There was no news. Until February of this year, her mother, Zhang Le, learned in her hometown that Gui Bao had been abducted and sold by her son, Wenxing, in collusion with Gong Li, Chai Lu, Li Liu, and other Ningbo women residing at No. 147 Aierkao Ke Road, No. 38 Dongyouheng Road, etc., to a wealthy man in the Xinghua County of Fujian Province. They received three hundred silver dollars and divided the spoils for their own use. The mother was furious, considering it an unprecedented act of a maternal uncle abducting and selling his niece. She beat him severely and made him write down the addresses of each woman. She then came to Shanghai and informed her daughter, Wang Le, who reported it to the Huishan Police Station. Detective Li Hongsheng was dispatched to secretly arrest the three women at their addresses and send them to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Details have been reported in this newspaper. This morning, Judge Wu Gang and Judge Han presided over the continued interrogation in the Third Criminal Court. Lawyer Zhang Shizhu of the police station stated the previous circumstances and also said that, according to investigations during the interim period, the defendant Gong Li was actually not involved and requested her release. A letter has now been received from the Ningbo County Government, stating that Le Wenxing had already fled without a trace on the 21st of this month upon hearing the news. The letter was presented for inspection. Wang Le then explained the details of the incident, and her mother, Zhang Le, testified that she had entrusted relatives to watch over Le Wenxing at the time, but he had escaped and she did not know where he was staying. Chai Lu testified that although she had previously been acquainted with Le Wenxing, they had separated last September due to differences and were not involved in the abduction. She asked for leniency. Li Liu testified that she had known Le Wenxing as a neighbor, and he had repeatedly tried to seduce her but failed, making false accusations. Judge Wu ordered them to be remanded in custody for sentencing at a later date, and Gong Li was granted release.</p>

<h3 id="e315">Shanghai's National Crisis <a href="#e315" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c315" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">315</a></h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Since September 18th, our China has suddenly faced a "national crisis." Since the nation is already in "crisis," it should be very painful. This can be seen from the government's repeated orders for "the whole country to lower flags at half-mast in mourning." It can be seen that the government attaches great importance to and is enthusiastic about the "national crisis." It seems that no matter how calm, the two words "national crisis" are always shouted out first. And we, the common people, because it is "justified," boldly follow suit and shout even louder.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, the call for "national crisis" is, of course, even more lively. For a long time, many patriotic comrades had black gauze wrapped around their sleeves, and the four white characters "Together to Face the National Crisis" were printed on them. How passionate, how "patriotic, not daring to lag behind." Later, the January 28th Incident occurred, and Shanghai was truly in "national crisis." Many people with no money and no weapons were slaughtered and burned by Japanese imperialism, resulting in wives and children being separated, and families being destroyed. Because they had no possibility of moving and had not received orders that the people could also resist with arms, the English and American flags fluttered on the cars of the masters and mistresses, and they had already called servants, and moved the whole family to the concession, including opium pipes and foreign dogs. After listening to the gramophone record of "Foreigners Laughing" and four rounds of mahjong, they also dressed neatly and went up to the roof garden to listen to the distant sounds of gunfire or watch the fire with binoculars, to show that they did not forget the "national crisis." Later, the National Army retreated to Zhenru in accordance with orders. After it was written in the May 5th Agreement that China could not station troops in Shanghai, some people squeezed a cold sweat, and some ran to the scorched earth and rubble to dig for the white bones of their wives, children, and parents, while the masters and mistresses thanked God and laughed with joy. At this time, the national crisis in Shanghai had naturally passed. Naturally, in the dance halls, in the wine shops, in the massage parlors, in the racecourses, the so-called "national crisis" had long disappeared without a trace. Naturally, it was a celebration for all, and the world was at peace.</p>
<p>However, even though "dancing to save the country" and "entertainment to save the country" are now shouted with all their might, "aviation to save the country" has followed, rising and resounding through the clouds. It can be seen that the people of Shanghai are still very interested in the "national crisis." At least because this kind of "saving the country" is not so troublesome. All that is needed is for everyone to take out money to decorate the "national crisis." Moreover, it is said that this kind of "saving the country" is the most effective.</p>
<p>The best thing is that the sounds of horses neighing and people shouting north of the Great Wall, and the planes and cannons on the edge of Rehe, cannot be heard at all in Shanghai. Even if thousands of Chinese soldiers in the guise of peasants are killed, it is still irrelevant to Shanghai. In addition, there are rumors of direct negotiations, and Japanese imperialism will certainly not attack Shanghai again. Therefore, being so enthusiastic about "saving the country" as it is now is indeed sufficient and more than enough.</p>
<p>However, there are also some people who want another war to happen in Shanghai, because, as in the January 28th Incident, a pavilion room can get a rent of twenty yuan, which is indeed a rare opportunity.</p>
<h3 id="e316">Ice Chewing Records <a href="#e316" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c316" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">316</a></h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>In today's society, only a certain kind of people can distinguish class consciousness most clearly, that is, the tea room colleagues in hotels, bathhouses, companies, and institutions. If you ask them about the people who pass before their eyes every day, who is three points higher and nine percent lower than whom in terms of status and wealth, I guarantee that they will answer very accurately.</p>
<p>One day, a large crab and a small crab were arguing. It was because the large crab was teaching the small crab, who refused to obey. The large crab said, "Son, why do you always walk sideways? Why don't you be more disciplined and walk straight forward?" The small crab replied with disdain, "I'll ask my father!" The large crab raised its toes, but limped and dared not move. It turned out that it had always only</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>knew how to walk sideways. There are many fathers in the world who walk sideways without restraint, wanting people, celebrities, but they always teach their children and descendants to walk straight, which is as comical as the large crab.</p>
<p>Recently, I moved to Baoshan Road, the frontline of the Shanghai war. I run around every day among the broken walls and rubble, and found a place where I really need to thank the Japanese. The original towering buildings have now become shelters for the poor. Whenever a storm comes, the poor don't have to worry about not having a place to hide. Especially in the evening, you can only see the dark groups of beggars, small people following adults, hunchbacks and pale faces, surging in and out of those broken eaves like tides. If this were before the "January 28th" incident, the poor would not have had such an active and free opportunity? Isn't this the grace of the Japanese? I should express my gratitude here on their behalf! Alas, eaters!</p>
<p>I seem to have heard many adults and gentlemen say that the Chinese nation has laid a solid foundation that is unyielding. Although it has been conquered by foreign races many times in history, the result has always been that the foreign races were assimilated. Now things are a bit different, or the foundation has changed direction. Let me use a small thing to speak. Our modern clothing, since the Western style came, needless to say, new-style figures all regard wearing Western clothes as etiquette, and even old-fashioned people are also trying it out like monkeys wearing colored jackets. Such Westernization is ironclad proof that they have been assimilated by foreign races. Only the Japanese and Indians can still maintain their inherent national spirit. Look at the ordinary Japanese who always wear kimonos, and the Indians who always can't bear to part with their national cloaks, even though they are already slaves of a fallen country. This is indeed a small thing, and the people of the country should also know to be vigilant.</p>

<p>— Kong Fanzhang</p>
<p>A long journey entrusted to a clear tour, sitting and watching the clouds and smoke for thousands of miles in autumn, half of the setting sun with two banks of water, the conquering wheels and dreams pass Suzhou,</p>
<p>Second</p>
<p>Green rice fields without end, ten miles of mountain ponds planted with apricot flowers, strangely, three or five wisps of smoke rise, there are people living in the deep green sun,</p>
<p>Farewell, Nanjing</p>
<p>Farewell, Nanjing, full of melancholy, looking back with extra affection, pitiable is the color of the stars and moon, long shining on the sounds of pipes and strings, happy land without soldiers, official field with war, Rehe frequently reports emergency, how to comfort the peace,</p>
<p>Last night I had a dream: a group of people surrounded a young man who had attempted suicide, and one of them was reprimanding the young man: "Now is the time when the nation and the country are in trouble, how can you play this kind of useless trick! Suicide? You must know that the water in the Huangpu River is cold and turbid! Only the tide in the Heilongjiang River, surging with crimson blood, is enough for us to bathe in!" The young man opened and closed his eyes without taking it in, and replied intermittently; "Thank you...you...your teachings! Only because...I have a...girl...friend, who took a boat from ×× port to Shanghai, and when it arrived...at the mouth of the river, it was actually...overturned by a hurricane. My girl...friend was also buried in the belly of the fish. That's why I dare, I dare to make up my mind...to commit suicide!"</p>

<p>— Chen Diqing</p>
<p>Ding! Ding! Ding! This is -- the academy's afternoon one o'clock class bell, it has already rung. One by one the students walked into the classroom, still holding a Western-style book in their hands, so we know this is an English class.</p>
<p>More and more students, in the whole classroom, a kind of noisy, lively, chaotic, crazy laughter, clucking, ... sound comes out, the procedure is very chaotic.</p>
<p>English professor Mr. Wu came, wearing a black-grey long robe, with tortoiseshell glasses on, not very tall, or even a little shorter than ordinary people, looking like a young man in his twenties. When he saw the classroom door, to be honest, he seemed a little scared, and his two eyes, covered by tortoiseshell glasses, were always rolling left and right. However, when he stepped onto the platform, he smiled again, this smile seemed like a lovely expression to the students in the hall.</p>
<p>"Dear students, please be quiet, don't talk," Mr. Wu said in a very weak voice and very gently after he got on the platform:</p>
<p>The air in the classroom told us that today's class was indeed different from the usual class. Every student's mind was looking forward to, expecting, a kind of major problem that they wanted to say but dared not say. The words of the teacher, which were ineffective in ordinary times, were particularly effective today. Although the voice was so weak, it immediately calmed the noisy, chaotic classroom. Every student stared blankly, hoping to solve this major problem.</p>
<p>"Ha! Ha! Why are you all here so early today?" Mr. Wu seemed very happy and said this again, making all the students in the hall laugh.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wu! Don't you know? The school is holding monthly exams next week. Everyone is here today hoping you can give us a topic." A student seemed to be answering, and everyone applauded.</p>
<p>"Oh! So that's how it is! Ha! Ha!..." Mr. Wu laughed, and the whole hall burst into wild laughter and applause.</p>
<p>"Mr. Wu! What will the exam be like this time! Let's do it the same way as before! Please give us a topic quickly, so we can prepare, prepare,..." Another student stood up and said, followed by another round of applause.</p>
<p>"Of course, the same way as before."</p>
<p>"Hurry! Hurry, give us the topic!"</p>
<p>"Okay! Okay! Everyone, don't make noise, I still have something to say to you! Regarding this exam, you should understand my difficulties. When doing anything, you should consider both sides, so that both sides can benefit. For example, in the previous few exams, I gave you the topics one or two weeks in advance. Although it was beneficial to you, it was not good for me as a teacher. It would either be said that I was too careless, or that I was too sloppy. Isn't that just considering your side! So, no matter what, I can't give you the topic this time, so I can consider..."</p>
<p>"No! No!" Mr. Wu hadn't finished speaking, and there were many voices of opposition saying:</p>
<p>"Opposition! Opposition!"</p>
<p>"Absolutely not! Absolutely not!"</p>
<p>"Absolutely against! Absolutely against!" In this mixed opposition, there were also clucking, banging... floor noises, table noises, whistle noises...</p>
<p>"Everyone, don't make noise, don't quarrel, I haven't finished speaking yet!... A student listened and suddenly became a little quieter again. Mr. Wu continued, "There is one more thing, didn't the Ministry of Education send someone to investigate last year? At the same time, there was a kind of bad criticism, saying that the grades of our school's students are too bad, too careless. This kind of criticism not only hinders the school's reputation, but also greatly affects your future. Therefore, no matter what, you have to bite the bullet and ask for some knowledge, which will be a tool for you to do things in the future. So, from now on, don't be too careless about the exams. No matter what, I can't give you the topic this time; however, regarding the scores, I can be a little more lenient when I grade the papers, and just make sure you pass..."</p>
<p>"Okay! Since Mr. Wu won't give us the topic, then please draw a scope for us." A student was moved by the teacher's words and made a request.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu had no choice but to agree to the student's second request. However, Mr. Wu declared again that you must keep it a secret, so that you won't tell the other students, teachers, or people outside.</p>

<p>Introduction to Russian Language Learning Places and Textbooks Since the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, the number of people learning Russian in the city has increased. However, everyone considers the learning place and textbooks to be two major difficulties. It is said that throughout Shanghai, except for one or two foreign-run schools, there are no schools or private schools founded by Chinese. However, because foreign teachers charge too much, there are few students, and the language barrier is especially inconvenient for beginners. Therefore, the newly established schools by Chinese and the textbooks written by Chinese in this city are introduced to those who are interested in studying Russian. Learning places: (1) Shanghai Newspaper Library Attached Evening Tutoring School, located at No. 345, 3rd floor, Continental Shopping Mall, Nanjing Road, (2) Russian Language Special Evening School, located on the 780th floor of Xiafei Road, founded by Mr. Zhang Qingchun, the current Russian translator of the High Second Branch and Russian professor of Soochow University. Complete textbooks: (1) The latest Russian Conversation Reader, written by Bai Liewei, divided into two volumes, upper and lower, is a complete set, with a price of 3.3 yuan per set, plus 23 cents for postage from other places, sold by Jia 4, Xique Hutong, Chongwenmennei, Beijing, (2) New Russia, written by Zhang Ximan, one volume in total, priced at 1.5 yuan, sold on behalf of the Minzhi Bookstore on Shandong Road in this city.</p>

<p>Editor: Laborers, shop assistants, and apprentices under the iron heel of capitalism have always had to silently endure everything from their employers, with little opportunity to participate in opinions. Therefore, the labor-capital divide is very distinct, and all the doubts and hidden pains of shop assistants have no way to be resolved or vented. Since your esteemed publication opened the shop assistant communication column, you have painstakingly and meticulously answered the questions and difficulties of shop assistants; this spirit of serving society and benefiting the masses is truly worthy of our praise and gratitude. Now I have a question, please grant me an answer:</p>
<p>I am an apprentice at ×× Industrial Company in this city. When I left school and entered this company, many classmates congratulated me in unison, and even the teacher who introduced me said, "This company's management is so good, its methods are so good, its business is so prosperous, and its treatment is so generous. You have a future full of hope in this company!" Who knew that the reality was far from it, this company is just living up to its reputation in vain:</p>
<p>Time has passed like a monotonous three years, and I, who was full of hope, have become a disappointed youth. Although my age is constantly increasing, I am still engaged in a delivery career (my position is delivering packages, so I am also known as the package delivery apprentice). In these three years, apart from receiving a bonus of six dollars, the remaining few dollars of monthly salary are sometimes deducted due to leave taken for weddings, funerals, or illnesses. Now I am already twenty-one years old, sir, how can I face my parents, how can I face myself!</p>
<p>Now, for the sake of the company's bright future and driven by my own ambition, I would like to make the following contributions to the new manager; our youth leave their parents and hometowns to study commerce far away. The reason is to learn a skill to earn a living, to serve society, and to support our families. Therefore, the manager is like a second parent to the apprentices; the master instructors have the responsibility of teaching the apprentices. Now, we dozens of apprentices, in addition to completing twelve hours of delivery work, have no other training or teaching. Therefore, after three years, we are still the same as before, and we still do not understand business conditions or experience. This is detrimental to both the future of the apprentices and the company itself. I would like to ask the new manager to pay attention to this point.</p>
<p>The company's business has always been managed by the manager alone, and the heads of each department are just the manager's eyes and ears. Although there have been several reorganizations, it is always the same old soup.</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>Therefore, our promotion depends entirely on the director's joy or anger. Nowadays, "flattery," which is recognized as one of the arts of dealing with people in the 20th century, is indeed an excellent shortcut to seek promotion, but how many of us apprentices who have not been in the world for long understand it? Moreover, "those with ambition are ashamed to flatter," right? Therefore, there are many people who remain apprentices even after studying for three or four years (I am one of them). As for the director, because they mostly came from "flattery," they only seek to increase their own salary and stabilize their position, and they do not hesitate to be accomplices, treating lower-level colleagues harshly. For example, holding salespeople responsible for out-of-stock items is one of their clever tricks to curry favor. The manager listens to the director without question. After the January 28th Incident, they did not hesitate to reduce the salaries of the younger employees by ten or twenty dollars in the name of austerity to increase the salary of the director who earns nearly one hundred dollars a month, causing widespread resentment and people harboring the intention to leave. However, the manager insisted on courteous reception and clear inventory. I would like to ask the new manager to correct this kind of superficial treatment that does not address the root cause and forces people to do the impossible.</p>
<p>It is said that the interior is going to be expanded, according to news from senior staff, new employees will be recruited, but the apprentices will remain unchanged. Sir, this is so bitter for us apprentices, are we supposed to be apprentices until we die? Regarding the duties of a salesperson, apprentices can handle about half of them. If we are given a ten-dollar salary to do a job that is worth more than ten dollars, we would be truly grateful. What could be better? Moreover, people from outside the company may not be able to handle the duties in our company because they have to manage inventory, keep accounts, and other extra work. Now, instead of using the people we have, we are seeking help from outside. I really don't want this policy of abandoning the fundamental and pursuing the superficial to be realized. For the sake of the future of many comrades, I would like to ask the new manager to adopt my humble opinion:</p>
<p>I originally wanted to write the above opinions directly to the manager, but after thinking carefully, if my enthusiasm is appreciated, that would be fine, but if I accidentally offend his dignity, then being fired is a small matter, and I would also be labeled as a reactionary, which I dare not accept! Finally, I want to state to you, sir, that I am not fabricating facts or attacking others, but I am relying entirely on the dictates of my conscience to urge the manager to awaken and to make a cry for our comrades who are experiencing the same situation. Sir, I think you will certainly not reject me because of the imperfection of my writing, right?</p>
<p>I wish you well.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Lu Yiping, an apprentice</p>
<p>Editor's note: Mr. Lu is an employee of the well-known × National Products Company in this city. Recently, we have received letters from employees of this company several times, all unanimously complaining. This proves that Mr. Lu's statement of "widespread resentment, and people harboring the intention to leave" is indeed not fabricated. In order to hope that this relatively well-established national products company will flourish, we also take advantage of the opportunity of the new manager's arrival to introduce Mr. Lu's submission to him.</p>
<p>Mr. Lu's first suggestion is to give apprentices a real opportunity to practice. On this point, we can look at the post office, which is still under foreign management in fact. They rotate every newly arrived low-level employee to practice in various departments; therefore, after a year, they can roughly know the overall situation.</p>
<p>His second suggestion is that the manager should have a more accurate observation of the assessment of lower-level employees. This seems difficult to do; because the manager has to manage all the affairs of the store, he naturally has to rely on middle-level employees as his eyes and ears for the assessment of lower-level employees. But now that it has come to "widespread resentment, and people harboring the intention to leave," it is obvious that the work of middle-level employees has its own unfairness. In order to stabilize the overall situation of the store, it is necessary to steal some time from the busy schedule and investigate it yourself. On the one hand, you can promote some talented people, and on the other hand, you can find out and punish some unfair middle-level employees.</p>
<p>His third suggestion is that when the company expands, if it needs employees, it should promote as many apprentices as possible. This is really right. We hope that the new manager originally intended to do so, but due to the miscommunication of senior staff, it caused Mr. Lu's anxiety. If the communication is not mistaken, then it is really necessary to cancel the original plan and adopt Mr. Lu's suggestion.</p>

<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(9) Marriage and Principles</p>
<p>The climate of the western United States is indeed drier and clearer than other places in the temperate zone. After muddling through three years at the University of California, Wu Yi really didn't want to return to Shanghai, surrounded by a damp air. However, a voluminous doctoral dissertation had been created with painstaking effort, and a diploma worth dozens of times more than gold had also been received as scheduled. The purpose of gilding was achieved, so what was the point of lingering in the United States? Wu Yi wasn't a fool!</p>
<p>When Wu Yi set off from Seattle to return to China, he first called Wang Yulin to report his itinerary; he hoped that as soon as the ship arrived in Shanghai, he could meet his three old friends whom he had been separated from for a long time at the pier. However, the result was very embarrassing for him. Only a group of dockworkers he didn't know came to the pier to welcome him that day. The three old friends were nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>"Wang Mansion? Please let Lawyer Wang speak!" In a mood of extreme anger, Wu Yi suppressed his anger and went straight to × Hotel. After checking into a room, he was busy calling Wang Yulin's office. The reply was "Lawyer Wang is at home," so Wu Yi immediately inquired at Wang Mansion again.</p>
<p>"Ah! Dr. Wu? It's unfortunate today, my wife just gave birth at home, and I couldn't come to the pier to pick you up! Please forgive me! Are you angry?" Wang Yulin appeared on the phone, speaking extremely hastily. "At this moment, the child has not yet landed. Are you in room 305 of × Hotel? I will definitely come! Please forgive me! Please forgive me!"</p>
<p>Only then did Wu Yi relieve half of his anger, and happily put down the phone. At the same time, he recalled the wedding photo that Yulin had sent him last spring. He hurriedly opened his suitcase and rummaged through it, and finally found it.</p>
<p>"Ah! What a beautiful wife!" A petite, graceful, and generous bride appeared in the photo, causing Wu Yi to praise involuntarily. Although he had seen it once, he only noticed Wang Yulin's good fortune when he looked at it again now. He held this eight-inch photo and sat quietly in a daze, as calm as someone who had lived in Shanghai for a long time.</p>
<p>More than an hour later, Wang Yulin indeed rushed over in disheveled clothes, his demeanor as excited as if he had drunk alcohol.</p>
<p>"Hello! Old Wu! I am extremely happy today!" He sat down on the table, his face full of smiles. "You have come, and I have also given birth to a son, isn't this double the happiness!"</p>
<p>"Congratulations! Congratulations! I simply rushed back specifically to congratulate you!" Wu Yi also smiled. "But Zhao Qianli, has he sent me letters recently, where is he at the moment? After the Da Wang Company closed down, where did our Lin Daping go?"</p>
<p>When Lin Daping was mentioned, Yulin seemed very unhappy and immediately stopped smiling. However, he did not disappoint Wu Yi and still faithfully told him about the recent situation of Lin Daping and Zhao Qianli. Only then did Wu Yi know that Zhao Qianli had received extremely satisfactory results from the lengthy discussions he had published in the newspaper on weekdays ten days ago, and had gone to Hankou as the director of the Public Works Bureau. For some reason, Lin Daping had also become a famous lawyer at sea. Although Mai'e had died, he had married another opera singer and was living a very comfortable life, and also had a car with a number of four "fives." Unfortunately, according to Yulin, he also had some of the arrogance of a petty man who had achieved success, as arrogant as if he thought the world was his alone. No wonder Yulin had notified him of Wu Yi's arrival, but he turned a deaf ear.</p>
