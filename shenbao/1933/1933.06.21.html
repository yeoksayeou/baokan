<h3>世界經濟會議之暗影實</h3>
<p>世界之經濟恐慌。其來源甚久遠。其内容極複雜。要約言之。不外兩端。第一。在政治上之尖銳對立。如所謂賠欵也。戰僨也。殖民地市塲之分割也。東方問題之糾紛也。有一於此。即足以招致世界之不安。使世界經濟之平衡。發生影響第二。在經濟上之利害衝突。如所謂信用恐。慌也脫離金本位。也通貨膨脹也。關稅戰爭也危機重。重在在皆足以破壞世界經濟之安全。使各國皆蒙重大影響。即令手腕敏妙之國。運用得法。在數字上能保持原狀。然其實内中隱伏之經濟矛盾。與其他病象顯著之國。家初無少異。如日與美。法與德。表面雖大有差異。而恐慌之内容則同。蓋資本主義先天帶來之恐慌根因。即伏着内在的矛盾。以故消費能力低落。生產過剩。市塲狹小皆爲不可避免之事實也。設令處置政治上問題。如戰債得以運用。巧妙而暫時妥協。市場爭奪。亦以協議而得和平分配然若國際上之信用恐慌。不能回復。通貨仍動搖不定。則此世界。又如何能安。故回復國際信用。安定通貨比率。實爲今日第一亟待解决之難題。亦即爲世界。經濟會議所共同注目之第一點也。惟以事實上觀察。美國擁有黃金四十餘億美金。且不能不脫離金本制。而採取通貨膨脹政策。英國殖民地市塲遍乎全世界。且不能不採用减低通貨平價。以暫維其經濟上之小康。日本爲資本主義之後起。者乃亦步英國後塵。運用膨脹政策以遮掩其肆力侵略中之恐慌狀態。於是乎維持金本位制之主要國家。僅法德兩國如比如荷。均賴廣大殖民地爲之調劑而法德兩國中。德國以元氣未復。雖政治上搶得先着。經濟仍不免居於被指導地位。法則欲保持金本位制。不得不與英美所領導之放棄金本位制度之國家。成對立形勢在此對立形勢。中以戰債關係。歐洲各國利於聯合一致以制美。而美國則利在使歐洲各國。各别分離。以便　債協定之易於成立。故前此白宮會議。所以取個别談話　不用圓棹會議也。同時英美兩國以匯兌比率各持己見。對英磅比率。英主張三圓半美金對英一磅。美則主以四圓美金當英一磅。結果卒用三圓七角五分之折衷。以安定英美之匯兌。其實市塲變化。又豈是政治家之協定所能指揮。故英美間之妥協。亦甚不可恃。由是可知今日欲謀世界經濟之穩定。亦殊不易也。</p>
<p>歐洲四强公約。雖在世界經濟會議之前簽定。但其内容。巳與原來提議之意旨相異。德國對於其軍備平等及廢止凡爾賽和約之願望。旣未能滿足。意大利之滿懐不平。亦未嘗消釋。則歐洲政治關係惡化之原素。依然存在。故經濟會議開幕一週之間即發生重重波折。德國於提出修改凡爾賽和約之外又提返還菲洲殖民地之備忘錄。此固以英法各國之堅持。難成事實。然而此會議前途之一大暗。礁即伏於此。此外如關係世界極重大之東方問題。亦尙未敢提及。東方經濟關係之複雜情形更未充分討論。以故日本本擬相機提出之「裁制排貨運動之　議。」亦即暫行擱置。其主要原因固在乎擴大其所謂「軍事的自衛行動」開展其侵略政策。然亦有以窺見其會内之情形矣。</p>
<p>不流血之關稅戰爭。列國雖曾屢提休戰。但皆未能見諸實行。近頃美國實行通貨膨脹之後其實際上困難。且愈增多「開誠相見」者。徒爲外交上之名詞。實際利益。詎肯輕於犧牲。况各國皆重視保護貿易主義。如工業開發補助金交通業助成金等。尙不易成立共同取消之協定。又何肯　低其關稅耶。此非吾人故作悲觀之論。聳人聽聞。實以危難當前。吾國人皆須明瞭其情勢。而有以及時奮勉者也。</p>

<p>不啻對歐洲要求之答覆</p>
<p>（巴黎）倫敦會議中關於英美法等主要幣制之穩固辦法、現巳顯有故意延宕之趨勢、故法國政界當局對此巳感覺極度之不安、而美總統羅斯福氏對於金元與金鎊之平準辦法、現巳顯露一種極消之能度、因此在法國方面亦如冷水澆背大有慄然之勢、（十九日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）就種種情勢觀之、美國在羅斯福總統發展其國内復興之程序以前、對於世界經濟大會將抱消極態度同時美代表團巳奉訓令苟未獲總統同意、不得有束縛自巳之行爲據可恃方面云、參議員畢特門主張各國一律用金銀爲準備金佔百分之二五一節、可視爲美總統對於歐洲要求通貨穩定之答覆蓋畢特門之主張、完全與美總統國内與國際之政策相合也、是以此間人士視此爲經濟大會現正着手應付基本事項之表示摩萊敎授下星期抵倫敦時將不參加大會之討論、但將爲羅斯福總統與美代表團間之接洽人、並將設法澄淸因美總統經濟政策而起之紊亂（二十日路透社電）</p>

<p>據深悉菲島情形談、菲列濱考察團之來華、其目的不在吸收華貨、而在向華推銷菲貨、其願望與我國商業團體大相逕庭、蓋菲島貨物之銷路、專恃美國容納、今菲人竭力謀恢復自由、進行獨立、於對美輸出、不免頗有影響故欲轉而向日本或中國覓求市場、作美國大主顧之替代者繼見日本祇有向外傾銷、而無購買外貨之理、而我國又希冀發展對菲輸出、俱與其考察之願望相違故返菲以後遂致杳無音訊、回憶該團返菲時、本埠某茶商與某蛋商、各以茶蛋裝一大件、作爲樣品、交其帶返菲洲詎被該團携去以後亦迄無復音來滬、是該兩件樣品、巳不啻爲華商送行該團之禮品矣、</p>
<h3>公利輪、在大埔擱淺</h3>

<p>卸貨開出公利輪載重約一千八百噸、由靑島奘載大批貨物到海州出卸、於本月十日抵大埔港、停靠碼頭、卸除各艙貨件、惟因無貨載出、故於淸船後卽放空船回靑、詎甫經解纜、卽肇大禍、</p>
<p>大潮壓迫邇日海州正値大潮汎該輪船從大埔碼頭啟椗、適値該港虎頭潮（卽大埔港大潮名稱、）盛漲、水勢之巨、壓力之大、異乎尋常、該輪方將岸邊之纜解去、外擋之錨練、尙未起出而大潮巳來船身受其衝盪因空艙無貨一時不能支持、船身立刻向裏擋横倒、</p>
<p>船身覆倒艙身被激潮衝流、雲時間側向碼頭方面倒下、一時無法挽救、而且船横之際、來勢極速、未及三分鐘、全身巳倒臥於水面、輪上船員生火水手等正在全體工作、不虞船身横倒、突如其來、多不及逃出、祗得紛紛向港内跳落、一時大埔港内、秩序大亂、附近小船爭來撈救、幸無搭客而落水之船員海員、結果悉行救起、</p>
<p>船主急救三分鐘後、船底亦漸漸顯露、則全輪將有覆没之險、在此千鈞一髮之時、船主朱君、急將外擋未曾起起出之鐵鍊、啟機盤繞、藉此一錨之力、乃將船身拖住、所以未卽倒翻沉覆者、幸此一錨之牽拖也、</p>
<p>擱淺灘岸船主乘機急開快車、將該輪駛至大埔港附近淺灘上船身擱住蓋不如是、恐難保船身安全、昨日此間得訊、一而由船主致電總行、設法拖救、船身横倒之時、輪内物件頗多失落、而船體亦受損傷、但危險時期巳過、祇須拖援修理矣、</p>

<h3>沈田莘長子沈孟翼昨晨被綁</h3>
<p>新閘路上四綁匪突施綁案出事未久匪電告領回汽車｜沈田莘外强中乾爲同鄉所深知！</p>
<p>昨晨八時五十分左右、滬西新閘路江海關圖書館門首發生綁架案一起、茲將經過情形分誌於下、</p>
<h3>家庭情况</h3>
<p>沈田莘湖州人、年五十二歲、以絲綢爲業家住西摩路第四百九十三弄（即自在里）十號、民國十六年間、沈曾一度任本市政治分會委員及蘇州海關署監督、未幾即退隱、仍營絲綢生意、並開辦綢泰襪廠德和絲廠及地產事業、惟因年來絲業凋零、故沈氏經濟狀况、異常拮据、沈氏膝下有兩子兩女、長子名孟翼、現年二十五歲、長女名詒瑤、現年二十三歲、均帮同沈氏治生產、孟翼在外灘中國銀行國外匯兌部任職巳有五年、詒瑤供職於新閘路上海海關圖書館、</p>
<h3>兄妹同車</h3>
<p>沈氏租界有汽車一輛、租界照會爲第二零八五號、每晨孟翼與詒</p>
<p>瑤往辦公室時、即偕乘該車前往、車夫名朱廣峯、昨晨八時三十分許、兄妹兩人照例於略進早餐後、即偕出乘汽車赴辦公、室當由車夫駕駛、先開往新閘路第一七一四號送詒瑤至海關圖書館、及抵該館門首詒瑤即下車進内車夫朱廣峯亦　扳機將車調頭擬折往外灘、再送孟翼、</p>
<h3>四匪綁架</h3>
<p>詎斯時由對面街沿旁突衝來一人、身穿黑色綢長衫、袖出手槍向車夫朱廣峯威嚇並勒令停車車、夫無奈、乃即將車停住、詎斯時海關圖書館旁又躍出男子三人、亦各持手槍、向車撲來並代開車門、令車夫朱廣峯下車、朱祇得從之、於是四匪亟一躍上車、由三匪將孟翼挾住、並嚇禁聲張、由一匪駕車向膠州路而去、車夫朱廣峯見小主被綁、惶急萬分、乃亟返身奔入海關圖書館向詒瑤報警、</p>
<h3>匪方電話</h3>
<p>時詒瑤坐方甫定、正擬開始辦公、一聞此訊、亦手足失措經與同事磋商之下、乃急僱車飛奔回家、報告老父、轉報該管靜安寺路捕房請求援助、當由捕房撥派大批探捕分往滬西一帶四出兜捕、詎斯時沈田幸家突接一電話、對方僅在電話中訊問是否沈家、當回答稱是、繼則聽見對方說被綁時汽車現在斜橋附近望去開回問其何人則始終不言、時沈家方面即將此奇怪電話、向捕房報告捕房方面、即通知法捕房會同派探前往該處偵察、果在呂班路底徐家匯路近日暉港處發現上述汽車車、中尙存有雨衣一件、經沈氏家人辨認、確爲孟翼之物、探等即在該處四週偵察一過乃將車及雨衣一併帶回捕房存案、一面即通知本市各機關請爲帮同追緝、直至記者發稿時止尙無眉目、</p>
<h3>外强中乾</h3>
<p>按沈氏雖因熱心公益、常與一般名流往還、惟近來以絲業不振、内容亦甚空虚、所有房產、早經抵押殆盡、即現寓之西摩路住宅亦租自李姓、其所乘破舊不堪之汽車、並由朱姓之汽車夫包租而來、最近因作保受累巳被控於特區法院、其外强中乾之情形、凡屬湖州同鄉、類能言之、故此次其子被綁聞者咸以爲異、</p>
<p>劃及經費等、由江漢工程局負責、需用物質及招雇夫役、由地方政府負責、對於今後之預防工作、可保無虞朱氏又謂、水災會業巳奉命趕辦結束一部份工作則歸全國經濟委員會接辦、</p>

<h3>『申報叢書蘇聯第二次五年計劃」提要</h3>
<p>樊英女士編著全書六八頁</p>
<p>紙面三十二·開本定價洋二角五分轟動世界的蘇聯第一次五年建設計畫，巳以四年又三個月的時間，於一九三二年年底全部告成。現在，第二次五年計畫又自本年一月一日起開始了。關於第一次五年計畫，國内己有不少書籍爲之介紹，第一次五年計畫的結果所告訴我們的是蘇聯社會建設驚人的成績，數字上飛躍的增加以及社會主義全部的勝利。第二次五年計畫又包含着什麽樣的重大意義呢？使牠將蘇聯再進到那一階段呢，計畫的内容又是怎樣的呢，這些都是我們現在所急於要知道的。本書的目的，就是應此一需要將蘇聯第二次五年計畫作一個忠實的介紹。本書係樊英女士緼著。全書凡分十二節叙述。第一，引言，略述蘇聯自一九一七年十一月革命以來經濟發展狀態，與第二次五年計畫在蘇聯經濟建設上之意義，「第二次五年計畫，其特徵是實現社會主義的社會，並在經濟上企圖達到完全獨立於資本主義之外。」第二，述第一次五年計畫實續之回顧，說明第一次五年計畫之完成對於蘇聯經濟結構之影響，與第二次五年計畫與第一次五年計畫之關係。第一次五年計畫之成功對於蘇聯經濟結構之影響，第一是社會主義經濟基礎之奠定，第二是使蘇聯由農業國轉化爲工業國，第三是使蘇聯由小規模的農業轉化爲世界最大規模的農業。此外，因第一次五年計畫之成功，就充分地證明了社會主義戰勝了資本主</p>
<p>義，更說明了世界資本主義之没落，而社會主義下之生產事業，則相反恰爲蒸蒸日上。這些，都是我們在研究第二次五年計畫前，對於第一次五年計畫應有的回顧，唯其對於上述這些變動有了正確的把握，才能對於第二次五年計畫的内容和政治意義有充分的了解。此點在本書皆有相當說明。第五，接述第二次五年計畫之基本任務，首述第二次五年計畫編制經過，次述其政治的中心任務，第二五年計畫的政治中心任務是什麽呢？「乃是最後的肅淸資本主義份子和一般的階級，完全的滅絕生產階級區别和剝削制度的諸原因·，與夫克服經濟中人們意識中底資本主義之殘餘，將全體勞動人民變爲無產階級的社會主義社會之自覺的積極的建設者」，「换言之，建立社會主義經濟基礎的任務，第一次五年計畫，業巳解决，第二次五年計劃的任務，就是要在蘇聯建設社會主義社會。」次述第二五年計劃經濟的中心任務，卽「完成全部國民經濟之改造，對國民　濟一切部門，創辦最新式的技衛基礎。」次述社會的任務。更次述第二五年計劃對於化學，工業，方面之發展。第五，述第二次五年計劃中之農業綢領，第二五年計劃關於農業的任務，主要的是爲定社會主義的改造，大體上完成農業機械化，提高收成量，防止早荒等，其内容則爲㈠完成集體化，㈡農業機械化，㈢提高收成量，㈣防止旱荒，㈤　發展畜業，㈥提倡新式農業生產技衛等，本節皆有詳細說明。第六，述第二次五年計劃中之交通運輸業　領。分鐵道，水運，汽車運輸，航空，電訊事業，五項，從這喪我們可以看到第二次五年計劃對於交通運輸事業方面之大規模的發展。第七，述第二次五年計劃中的商業，關於商業，一方面，㈠發展國營商業，排斥私人經營，一方面則㈡擴大合作社綱，㈢發展對外貿易。這些本節都逐項加以說明。第八，述第二次五年計劃中生產力地域的配置，注重於各地方的平均發展，與有組織的聯合生產，這與資本主義國家的無政府生產狀態完全不同。第九，述第二次五年計劃中之技衛與科學，指出蘇聯對於技衛人材之注重，與技衛人材最近增加情形。第十，述第二次五年計劃中工農的福利水平，在五年計劃中，對於一般工農大衆，不但要大大地提高其物質生活，並將特别提高其文化水準，如澈底消滅文盲，出版，圖書館，電影等事業的大量擴充，皆將於五年内一一實施。以下第十一，第十二兩節，則接述第二次五年計劃開始執行之陣容，與第二次五年計劃與資本主義世界前途之展望。從這裏我們可以看到蘇聯建設的眞精神及其嚴密之紀律，如嚴行淸黨，根絕游民份子，勞　紀律之整頓，澈底掃除官僚主義等，都是他們在聞始執行計劃前對於各方面的一種嚴密的整頓。這難　是一本薄薄的小册，但叙述極爲翔實，尤　興趣。全書六八頁，首附銅圖八幅。</p>

<h3>詩人奇遇紀念十六世紀賣梅士詩人</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>白</p>
<p>香山答元九書，道了一句「時人多蹇，」歐陽修便根據這句話，從四字推廣而爲七字，呌做··「詩人少達而多　。」白歐這麽一說，做詩人便搠了霉頭，一直至今，只是不景氣。</p>
<p>莫說不景氣，做詩人也會鋼像　峩地站在公圍裏面，做詩人也會經了四百年悠久歲月依舊聲光並茂··做詩人也會在盛大的紀會中大砲台鳴禮砲二十一響慶祝這十六世紀的著作家。闊哉誰說「詩人多蹇，」誰說「詩人少達而多窮。」</p>
<p>詩人是誰？便是　梅士詩人。讀者注意。這位賈詩人，並不是唐代的賈島詩人啊。古稱「郊寒島瘦，「賈島在生前便偃蹇，到了死後也只是不景氣·，休說没人紀念他，便算紀念，也只有「淸酌羞，致祭於大唐詩人賈浪仙先生」罷了。中國詩人無論怎樣名望偉大，决無銅　高　，以及大砲台大鳴禮砲的奇遇。我所說的賈梅士詩人，當然不是國貨詩人，而是舶來品詩人了。</p>
<p>澳門，本是廣東的土地，又稱濠　澳·，明嘉靖三十六年葡萄牙人來此居住，歲納　　五百一十有五，這是外國人來中土關租界的開端·，雖然中外雜居，我國政府還有相當的主權，在乾隆年間，談地還設有縣丞副將把總等官。直到光緖年間，政府媚外。竟明許　人有永遠管理權，於是乎「割藤斷絕，」不是租給葡人，而是送給葡人了</p>
<p>賈梅士是葡國的大詩家，在公元一五五六年間，便來澳門石洞中結　居住。他曾創作辭華　贍的詩史，借此發揮其愛國的熱忱，他來澳以後，葡人便接踵而來，竟向嚴嵩政府時期，索得澳門做居留地了。他名日詩人，實則是一位探險家，合杜少陵哥崙布爲一人，無怪葡人在本年六月十日有這盛大的紀念會了</p>
<p>外國的一個詩人，有這不可思議的魔力·，中土同胞在海外做僑民，何止數百萬？若要這般榮遇，再也休想·，不被人家驅逐回來，巳是萬幸的了。在那葡人很熱烈的紀念賈梅士的時候，而墨西哥的華橋，都一一被人没收了財產，號陶痛哭地回轉故鄉。唉！「人比人，氣煞人」</p>
<h3>二元四角</h3>
<p>— 柯定盦</p>
<p>失</p>
<p>業者的男女，充　民上海市場，雖然平時在熟閙而煩　的馬路上，臨臨熙來　住男仍穿着很挺活西裝，女的穿着很摩登的時裝，有　　知道他　伊的中心，也許正懐着失業的悲哀。這樣的事情。並不是虚假，却有事實來作佐證。</p>
<p>這是一個通常的例證，ＸＸ商號式學校，要請一個職員式敎員，祇須在新聞</p>
<p>紙的本埠附刋上，登七八行廣告，會有許多人人來應　，假使刋載者：「不分性别」，那麽女人也會來個不少，他們雖然是明明白白的祇需要一個人，而應　者却來了不少，這原因是每個人自己以</p>
<p>自己作單位計算，他正不想到其他還有人和他一樣去應徵。</p>
<p>結果，當然抱失業而失望的人居多，難得的徼倖者，固能入選，可是他的生活費，一定會使他失望，「粥少僧多」的這句話，在現代看來，眞覺得非常貼切！在以前是不過對於一般男性的失業而論，現在男女平權，這個失業的流傳，却也會輪到女性身上，這正是一個時代的大轉變啊！</p>
<p>假如有家大公司，需要女職員二三人來供應，祇消化上二元四角錢去登一登新聞紙的本埠附刋分類廣告徵求欄，就會：「其應如響」的「羣　聚首」了。有位朋友却另一種見解，他說；「大公司徵求女職員二三人，來應徵的，至少也有五六十人，難道道五六十人，　祗有二三人有資格的嗎？這個我可不相信！」我以爲很是不錯，大公司也正很難，如其徵求二三人，那報名的限度，最好也限她一限，這樣免得無謂的增加許多失望的人，這也是社會上的一個重要問題。</p>
<h3>華僑</h3>
<p>— 賢賢</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>三十年前的華僑，風頭十足。雖然在本國苦得吃了早頓愁晚頓，可是要發一個很，串通了「帶黃魚」的，躱在大輪船的煤艙裏，一帆風順，帶到了外國，便抖了。雖然「支那人」到外國法，所幹的，洗衣工人，大菜司務，肩挑小販等勾當，甚至於做「僕歐」「苦力」，但是究竟「先令」，「法郎」，「馬克，「金元」，要比老牌的「七錢三」値錢，所以漂流在異國的，十年八載之後，衣錦榮歸，腰包裏都裝得「麥克麥克」了在那時候，各國都需要「華工」因爲『華工」有的是爹娘傳下來的『力』，儘肯像牛馬般的幹，而得到較低的報酬，『價廉物美』非但是『馳舉中外』，簡直是『有口皆碑』，所以受洋人的歡迎與讚賞自從金價暴漲，各國生產過剩，大閙其『不景氣』，『失業問題』，一天天地嚴重，於是乎華僑所啃的『麫包邊』，『麫包屑』，居然有昔有不屑一顧的『紳士』，也迂尊降貴地對之而埀涎三尺，於是乎你也『排華』，我也『排華』，把『價廉物美』的華僑，一大批，一大批的　逐，而把華僑所啃的『麫包邊』，『麫包屑』，硬生生劈手奪去。</p>
<p>華僑漂流在海外，給人家『蘿蔔不當萊』，也巳怪可憐兒的了，而領事老爺們，又只知道抽稅，派捐，甚至於勾給了地方政府來壓迫，無徵不至，所以我每次見腰包裏裝得『麥克麥克』而『衣錦榮歸』的華僑，時常會『則以喜』『一則以悲』的。但是近麥見到被迫回國的僑胞皇皇然如喪家之犬，『喜從何來』，只有「悲從中來」的份兒了。</p>
<p>在母國，吃不到『大米飯』啃不到『麫包屑』，華僑是中國人，也是苦命的。</p>
<h3>鞋</h3>
<p>— 靜谿</p>
<p>幼</p>
<p>年時，姑姑或婆婆送了雙紅綢繡花鞋，快樂的了不得；但須等到雖喜酒的機會才得穿上，要非小孩子健忘的話，那未免心中戚戚然了。</p>
<p>鞋也像衣服的流行一般會變遷。一忽兒尖頭，忽兒圓頭；從淺而深，由狹而闊，倒來轉去還不是老花頭。從跑鞋應世，大家都穿上一雙，據說是無分貴賤，所以稱做平等鞋。不過貴賤的階級是難打破的，坐汽車坐包車的「大亨」之流，必須要穿黑緞白底鞋，高視闊步的顧盼豪；時髦的男士，女士，也非穿履聲槖槖的皮鞋不可；而苦力和「拉」的同胞，仍然縳上雙靑筋盡露的草鞋，以便出賣他們的「力」的工作。</p>
<p>自扶小娘兒過橋「步步生春」的三寸金蓮，一變而爲挽住情人胳膞「步步發響」的高跟皮鞋，前者說是表現病態美，贊曰：醜哉！醜哉！後者說是表現康健美，贊曰：美哉！美哉！</p>
<p>女體師的學生都喜穿籃球鞋，配上遒而有勁的腿，短裙束得高高，跑路矯健不凡。於是：小夥子埀涎欲滴：大娘子望塵莫及；老頭子搖頭　曰：皆禍水也每天朝上六七點鐘光景，上體育塲的道上來了不少穿球鞋，捧大皮球的靑年。大槪在門口賣糖蔴球的小六子也有些眼紅，前天也穿上雙舊的籃球鞋了。有次，一位美國工程師問我：「貴國人竟如此喜歡籃球？」我一時瞠目不知所對。眞的，在電車裏，公園裏，路上，穿籃球鞋的人怎的多啊！</p>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第九回　語豈　由東床暗引突來良有以西席閑　趙</p>
<p>翁口裏吸着旱烟袋，只管望着趙自强。他無話可說，用手摸摸臉，又摸摸腦袋。趙翁道：你爲什麽不說？趙自强道：關連長和他們是親戚，究竟他們家的意思怎樣，他必然知道，我看還是問淸楚了他再說。趙翁道：你天天在營裏和他見面，　道就没有和他提到過這件事嗎？趙自强笑道：他不行，我想到城裏去問問關大嫂子去。他是個快嘴快舌的人，一定會把什麽困難的事，說了出來的。趙翁聽他如此說，不住的將手去摸着鬍子，他心裏就想着這孩子一定要去問關連長的媳婦，也許這裏面有什麽關係。就點點頭道：那也好，你就去罷。今天有功夫去嗎？趙自强道：今天倒是有功夫。趙翁聽說之後，又點點頭，很和緩的道：好罷，你就去罷，他抱着那不得不然的態度，這樣的答復了。趙連長聽說，他果然不再猶豫，立刻在家裏收拾收拾，就向城裏來。他到了城裏，並不去會關　武的媳婦，却記住了甘積之那天告訴的住址，向會館裏來找他。轉了許多胡同，才把這個會館找着。到了門口，問明了長班，給了他一張名片，說是要會一位新搬到會館裏來的甘二爺。本來到會館裏會客，也用不着費許多手續。旣是他這樣的周到，說不定他和甘二爺是什麽交情，只好拿了名片，到甘積之屋子裏來。積之這一程子，思想大變，買了許多的新思想書看。這時，正將一本半舊的唯物史觀，放在桌上，拿了一枝紅鉛筆，看一句，圈一名，長班走進了，問他道：甘先生，有個人要會你。說着，把趙自强的這張名片，放到桌上。他一見之下，呀了一聲站起來。拿了名片在手，顚上幾顚道：他會來拜訪我，這眞奇怪了，好罷，請他進來，我看他說些什麽（一○六）</p>

<h3>啤酒鍋的酒鬼</h3>
<p>捷</p>
<p>克斯拉失國的比爾善市，是釀造著名啤酒的地方。住在這市内，經營啤酒多年的釀造家配德羅拉氏，因爲經營失敗，忽然自殺了，他卽是猛然的投在沸熱的啤酒鍋中煮死的，後來這啤酒鍋内，忽然發現人聲，近而聽之，確是配德羅拉氏在内說話。他說；「我爲啤酒生意不好而自殺的，但是我的軀　雖然腐爛，而魂　仍舊不減，因爲我的冤魂，不能離開這鍋子的」。那釀造的夥伴，聽了這段鬼話，都嚇得肉　心跳，不敢走近，有一位　壯的人，把這鍋拾到陳列所襄去，可是每夜仍舊騒擾，因此這怪事喧傳了比爾善市中</p>

<p>，最近一對夫妻舉行紀念式，各方親友都來道喜，特美尼哥就向親友演說與台萊　結婚後的四十年中的生活，並立誓與妻同死同生，不料過了數日，台萊　果然患急病死了，當他死的時候，對特美尼哥說道；「我死以後，不過三日，就來約你同到天國去白相。」特美尼哥雖然悲悼的很，可是印刷所襄的事務還没有料理定當，一時不能和他同死，等到第三日，忽然也發熱病，遍求名醫診治，終難奏效，遂於當夜死去，這樣暗示的死期，傳遍意大利全國。</p>

<p>耳其的蒲爾沙市附近愛合裴村，住有一鄉民，名呌愛生迪，他養了一對鸛烏，後來產了一隻小烏，這鸛烏夫妻本來很和睦的，某日，突然騒擾起來，從野外回來　小烏食的雄烏，變更平日的樣子，很虐待那雌烏，可是雌烏也不肯吃虧，拚命的與雄烏抵抗，因此雄烏出了巢，到别處呼了同伴，在巢的上空羣集飛繞，大約過了半小時，那雄烏與别的二鸛，向巢中突　，把那雌烏啄死了，雄烏就在巢中抓了一隻小烏，棄在地上，爲什麽緣故呢，因爲那雌烏產卵以後，有一天，材中的小孩兒，攀登樹上，把一個七面烏的卵換了鸛烏的卵去，所以響育出來的七面烏，雄鸛非常嫉忌的，這也是異類相殘的一種表徵吧。</p>

<h3>鄭洪年發表高等敎育研究意見</h3>
<p>改革大學課程適合實際情形改良大學行政注意鍛鋉能力保障敎费獨立附加烟酒稅項上海市敎育會理事兼高等敎育研究委員會主任鄭洪年氏、昨向上海社記者發表高等敎育研究意見如下、</p>
<h3>改革大學課程</h3>
<p>本人年來聽各方人士言論、與夫讀報章雜誌所發表著作關於研究高等敎育者甚多、而其大者可歸納之爲下列三項問題、第一爲大學或</p>
<p>專科學校之課程問題、若文學方面、近都趨重現代文學、以合現代物質文明發達之潮流、此先哲荀子所謂法後王、原各根據現代社會以謀進步、</p>
<p>吾人亦相當贊同、第吾人應如何切實指導、使學生各能循序漸進、於短期内收多大效果、在課程方面不得不有仔細之研究、若自然科學方物、爲物質文明所由發達、世界各國莫不極力提倡、以求發展、而自然科學之進步、大有賴於研究之儀器設備、現在國内大學設備完全者極少、其學自外洋曾具根底者、回國後每若無由繼續求進、國内學生復以設備不周、致不能與理論相輔並進、减退興趣不少、吾國古來本無自然科學之研究、卽謂有之、不過依個人自己之志趣、作片段的探討、和整個有系統者、在現勢之下、只有採取歐美最新方式、迎頭趕去、此設備與課程之如何求充實、諸有待於斯學專門家之討論研究、若敎育學方面、雖然學說紛紜、但吾人目前先談吾國之敎育問題、吾國之瑖境如何、如忘却之、或不引爲根據相討論、謀發展、則近於空洞、難合乎實情、其中如敎育制度等、急應參酌昔日情形、研究一極適合於現代者纔是、若社會科學方面、學生習之者、畢業後爲社會服務、幾於大部份不見有相當效率、其原因當以多研究外國書本、而忽略國内歷史居多、外國書本自然以國社會情形爲背景吾人引資借鏡作爲例證、自無不可、然不適合於吾國實際情形者甚多、自然科學似乎有一定順序研究、始難而後或易、社會科學最後要切於實情立論似乎始易而後較難此於指導學習上不得不在課程中謀一適當的改革、他若學生所用以求學之工具、如中英文等程度多</p>
<p>不够用此於切實研究阻碍非淺、有主張大學二年注重中英文等研究工具、三四年始注重各科内容之探討、亦非無因、</p>
<p>改良大學行政第二爲大學或專科學校之行政問題、中國之大學或專科學校、均各自爲政、此直接影響於辦事之效率、間接即與學生之學業進步極有關係、中國人讀書素不注意鍛鍊行政能力、前淸二百六十年來、關於行政者只委諸紹興師爺辦理、此固有關於學問與閱歷、今後之如何改良大　學或專科學校之行政問題、連帶的養成靑年之行政能力、足以負此重責之方案、端賴於專家之討論也、</p>
<p>保障敎費獨立第三爲大學或專　學校之經費問題、依據總理遺敎敎育經費必須保障其獨立、現在以種種關係能獨立除保障處甚少、於是敎授難得安心敎書、學生每以政治關係荒廢學業、本人並非專　公立學校經費項、得獨立有保障、卽私立學校亦應脫離現在視學生學費、爲惟一收人現象、如基金之如何募集、與夫請政府補助等問題、都應有切實計劃、鄙意以爲在烟酒稅中儘可酌量附加一點作爲敎育經費、監稅亦是、他若遺產稅等　應抽若千作爲敎育費用市敎育會高等敎育研究會、卽延聘各門專家、對上述各問題互相研究、作成完善計劃、請求政府採納施行云、</p>

<h3>東華足球隊征菲記（五）</h3>
<p>第五戰四比一克薩佛琪（本報駐菲記者文初自馬尼剌寄）</p>
<h3>四比一勝薩佛琪</h3>
<p>昨日（八號）爲東華第五塲作戰、其敵方爲雄提全馬里剌　樂部球賽冠軍隊ＴｕｒｂａＳａｌｖｏｅｊ素以驃悍善戰聞（去年南華征菲、七戰七勝、惟彼隊稍與頡頑、不至不敗特敗、卽爲明證、全隊　力甚覺雄厚、是日之戰雙方守門、均爲遠東藍球能手、互有佳妙之表演、允以陸鍾恩之籃球避敵法、頗爲神化、菲軍前鋒、每來衝鋒、時輙爲頴倒、</p>
<p>[P開場接觸來勢兇猛&gt;</p>
<p>五時一刻、循例在場中合照及擇門後、雙力即佈定陣勢、笛聲一動、東華中路開火、迎日逐球前進、直達菲軍腹地、陳洪光挑球與曹秋亭、曹灣身執脚鈎與陳虞添、衝進命射、球勢略高失效、菲軍得順風之利、轉瞬得球長驅、直迫我防地其中鋒截球遠傳、左翼飛奔向前横掃一脚、球斜右滾去菲軍右内鋒趕上正擬舉足猛射、因略差一步球飛奔界外、大好機會失之　毫、全塲西人、在拍掌聲中、婉惜不、己皆謂今日聲勢佳也、</p>
<h3>偉哉陸遜帳中退敵</h3>
<p>雙方努力奪球正酣之際、菲軍在我門前十五碼處忽得自由球由其正前鋒提脚吊射、菲軍五前鋒趁勢一湧齊進、希圖撞倒我鐵門、陸爲人機警、雖在包圍當中左閃右避、立將球踼出、全場爲之喝采呌好、不料球踼去未遠、爲對方左中衛截、住成單刀赴會之勢、挑過中線、立轉交與右内鋒、順脚猛射但陸早有戒備、從容將球接出、此二次化險爲夷、有同陸伯言帷幄運　坐退劉先主數十萬雄兵也、</p>
<h3>敵壘旣破空勞無功</h3>
<p>自此我軍陣勢漸佳、屠開元在敵前右邊二十碼、得罰對方自由球、一脚遠吊、略越門而過、萬象華左路進窺、忽得來球隨交曹秋亭、曹再交李義臣李一轉身亂人視線再提脚射球球、去如矢但被西軍門將接出當在敵門混戰、李義臣又得陳家球之高傳昻頭一頂正向門去、又被鐵門將接出、在此數分鐘中、兩方鐵門將、皆展其大奸身手、西軍方慶危關巳渡之際李義臣曹秋亭捲土重來、在人叢中衝入一球、觀客歡呼雷動、然　判員以球以未入時、曹秋亭先巳越位、故判無效、誠如火爐胡蘆谷、燒不死司馬仲逵也、</p>
<h3>倉卒應敵幾於陷陣</h3>
<p>當東華　攻無功、菲隊力圖報復、因得順風之助頻向我方問鼎、内部數次被侵、幸得馮李鎭定後防、陸　恩死力守城、致西隊無功而　者屢戰至半塲將完時、鳥雲滿天、細雨絲絲、吳幼良奪球過勇、在門前十五碼誤手觸球、由對方左中衛主踼、球勢過高而失效、東華門前一塲危關、得以渡過、自此勇氣更加十倍矣、</p>
<h3>改換陣容奮勇先登</h3>
<p>休息時間旣過、雙方重整陣容、我方窺破敵軍弱點、乃調陳家球任右内鋒、曹秋亭任右翼馮運佑任中堅、關洵安任右後衛、並變更作戰　略以左右包抄、中路進攻之法應敵、續賓聲中、果然出奇制勝、經五分鐘之接觸、萬乳虎沿　進窺、閃過西軍中堅避過後衛、卽將球遠傳中路、且落點恰在門前、五虎齊進、李義臣趕出人羣、順勢一頂、爲西門將用手撃出、方幸險象巳過、陳家球趕上再進一脚西門將大出意外措手不及、敵壘因之攻破、</p>
<h3>混戰聲中敵壘再破</h3>
<p>我軍旣破平衡之局面、全隊精神爲之一振、陳洪光·曹秋亭·時有妙之傳遞與射撃、但均被接出兩軍方在酣戰之中、萬乳虎忽又得馮運佑中路來球、立卽傳與陳洪光、陳再傳與曹秋亭、此君素以踢射勁準稱、遇此良機、那肯放過、一　足之勞、西門將仆地撲救、巳無及矣</p>
<h3>意外倖運打破紀錄</h3>
<p>敵方雖備受壓迫、仍然努力抵抗頗有進展、我方前鋒因奪球過勇、被罰十二碼球、由正前鋒踼、一試成功、菲軍得此球如獲異寳、　我方在第二三四各次出戰、不容敵踪入門、唯此時得因受罰而被進一球、鴨蛋紀錄、巳爲打破、亦足以自豪矣、</p>
<h3>最後五分兩建奇功</h3>
<p>我軍被罰此球後、恐再蹈第一場覆轍、益加奮勇、五前鋒下總攻撃、曹秋亭又得萬乳虎之傳遞、從右路打個五鵠、球低而急、西門將雖倒身下接、然未擲出、巳翻身入門、是爲第三次之成功、中央開球後、東華五鋒、以勝利在握進攻不懈、瑕門連珠式射球、可謂爲東華黃金時期萬乳虎邊陲發難、遠傳與曹秋亭曹卽挑交中路、李義臣見機衝前、爲對方兩衛繞　、李卽施臥地遠射法、打鬥臥地右足一伸球如離弦之矢、直入綱　、是爲第四次成功、打破五塲接戰之高最紀錄、</p>

<h3>水災</h3>
<p>— 鳳音</p>
<p>在中國的古史上，有一個「書經」上所謂「洪水茫茫」的時代。這時代，孟子說是「洪水橫流，汜濫於天下，草木暢茂，禽獸繁殖，五穀殖，五穀不登，禽獸偪人，獸蹄烏跡之道，交於中國。」於是，『禹親自操棄　而九疏天下之嘥，腓　肢，脛</p>
<p>無毛，沐甚雨，櫛甚風」（莊子天下篇），「疏九河，瀹濟　而注諸海，决汝漢排淮泗而注之江，水由地中行。」可見水災之事，古巳有之，於今並不爲烈。那時的天子，據可考者，是一面拼命治水，一面是「禱於野」，說是「萬民無罪，罪在朕躬··」這就是說，不要小百姓負責任，把罪過一古腦兒拉到皇帝自己身上的意思。</p>
<p>以後是不同了。　武祥「粟香三筆」載，乙酉粤西李中丞奏報貴林水災，說災的起源是「先見靑氣，旋變白氣，後變黑氣，水即隨之而至，大有「黃河之水天上來」之槪。嘗時秦文伯觀察有力的補充說，「士人見之，其形如牛，就地一滾，水與天連，眞奇災也。」這「奇災」怎樣發生的呢？秦觀察的結論是··「粤西深山大壑，人跡罕到，不能遂法行之，天災流行，乃天意也，積德回天，或有濟乎？這是說，世風如江河日下，水災的責任，皇帝是不能負的，百官也是不能負的，應該是小民出來，一古腦兒拉到自己身上，說是「皇帝無罪，百官無罪，罪在民躬。」</p>
<p>現在是更有了新的形式。立災的責任，旣不在「朕躬」，也不在「民躬」，更不在「官躬」。所以武漢「連日山洪又發，街市多淹，江漢堤工局馬上聲明「與己無涉」，省政府打電報，「江漢堤工局爲堤工唯主管機關，事到臨頭，乃竟卸責地方政府，」並且有「瞻念前途，不寒而憟」之感。省政府雖說「未敢稍存諉卸，」小民實在是言之痛心。因此，終至於「在此地方中央互相推諉之際，江潮仍續漲不巳，「」人心益見恐慌「。</p>
<p>但是責任問題到底被弄明白了，十五日的漢口專電，就是一個證明··「土石工費總價約一百四十萬元，該項工程會經國聯專家許爲妥善，並以工價低廉，</p>
<p>較之歷來，大爲節省，各方多表滿意。」這不但有種種的根據，而且有國聯的洋鬼子做見證，大家都没有責任可負，在這裏，是事理至明的。</p>
<p>堤工旣「俱屬堅固經濟，」而仍舊發生水災，「實屬出於意外，」這「意外」的責任究竟要誰負呢？說到這裏，眞令吾儕小民，有莫名其妙之感了。</p>

<p>粉白臉像曹操，「寧肯我負天下人，不肯天下人負我」，他對台下看衆申明在案了。最下等的像小丑禁子，他上場便向台下自白··</p>
<p>「禁子，禁子，銀錢的進子，你是我的舅子，我便不要你的銀子」。</p>
<p>這雖然欠幽默，但是英雄本色，也自有可愛之處。</p>
<p>岸然道貎的正生代表正人君子之流，但像轅門斬子的楊六郎却被花臉奚落了</p>
<p>「我元師不忠，不孝，不仁，不義。八賢王討情不准便是不忠，佘太君討情不准便是不孝，我倆討情不准便是不仁，穆桂英討情准了便是不義」。</p>
<p>焦贊，孟良是這樣批評他的元師，將正人君子的面孔當着台下看衆呌破，這雖也稍欠幽默，但當我們還能認明正生是正人君子一流的東西，英雄本色也自有幾分顯露。</p>
<p>戲台上的人物我最看不起的是並不岸然道貎的正生，小生。范仲禹從箱裏出來，向左方要一陣瘋，向右方撤一陣痴的神氣·，王金龍探監，和黑袍夾道相逢，從玉皇駡到小鬼，表示他是一個狂人的伎倆··他們，幽默到怎樣的程度我不知道，我只知道他們是官僚，才子的代表。</p>
<p>施公案小說裏，有一個瘋和尙指着施公駡道··</p>
<p>「要說你忠不算忠，要說你好不算奸··忠奸二字眞難辨，專管拿錢入私　」做官的要錢，讀書的無恥，總而言之，統而言之，現在的時髦是我所看不起的時髦，爲什麽今日的優伶們偏只有這一套手脚？</p>
<h3>鄉村的夜</h3>
<p>— 另境</p>
<p>若說都市的夜是屬於現代的，那麽鄉村的夜確確實實是代表古代的了。不信你去住一夜看，尤其是剛從大都會裏去的人。那裏没有人，没有聲，没有光，除了偶然從遠處傳來的幾聲狗吠，餘下就是死一般的沉寂了。</p>
<p>說句實在話，我是怕鄉村的夜的。在鄉村裏住一個月，幾乎每夜都是惴惴不安，就到此刻執筆回憶起來的時候，心裏還有種說不出的難受。想一想吧。一間方方大大的屋子，四圍灰黑而發霉的牆壁，房頂很高，一根根的椽子露出在外邊，就是在白天，這屋内巳經顯得幽黯可怕，再加上晚間那盞半明半暗的油燈，門外刮着幽幽析的風，只要稍一動作或咳嗽，四壁就發出怕人的回響來，如果你再向窗外望望，那裏是黑影憧憧，彷彿有許多的魔影一搖一擺地向窗口撲來，我無論怎樣替自己解釋，這是風搖麥莖呀，這就是自己最喜愛的夾竹桃呀，而心裏怎麽也不會相信，兀自疑神疑鬼地放不下心，往往不敢過細去凝視就趕忙把頭退了回來。</p>
<p>我向自己發誓，要鎭定心神，把全副思想貫注在一椿事情上，於是看書了。但看了還没有三四行，自然又想到旁的地方去了，有時書是一個個字的念下去，一頁頁地翻過去，但過後一想，連看的題目也記不起來。那時所想的幾乎儘是悲觀的事情，本來自己的生涯中原也有過歡樂得意的時候，但此時彷彿再也想不起來，所想到的總是某時受人暗算了，某時上了人家的當，某時母親死了</p>
<p>，某時家裏破產了，某時···等等，這</p>
<p>是甚麽緣故呢？有時想到悲哀之處，眞會落下涙來，想到憤懣之處，幾乎要拿起裁紙刀來自殺。偶然一抬頭，宛如窗外有個黑影閃過，心一驚，思緒更混亂了，連小便也不敢再跨出門去。</p>
<p>到了這個時候，没有榜的辦法了，於</p>
<p>是只能睡覺。可是忽然又會發生奇怪的想頭，覺的這間屋子實在是死過人的，不然爲什麽會如此陰氣沉沉呢？而且死人就睏在我這床上，說不定還是吊死鬼呢，那一定在中間那支樑上了，愈想愈</p>
<p>可怕，只能决心不睡了。但究竟不能長此不睡呀，於是决定去了這古代的鄉村在那裏，雖然每夜都如此惴惴不安，可究竟住上了一個月，而且這恐懼究竟只在夜裏，每巴望到東方發出魚肚白的時候，我就從失眠的床上跳了起來，大吼一聲··「現在是人的天下了！」跑到陽光普照的田野去，　日光來滌除前夜帶來的惡劣的氣</p>
<h3>罷考</h3>
<p>— 綠莎</p>
<p>第六試塲之一幕</p>
<p>今天罷考的空氣更濃厚了，終於在吃飯的時候發動起來··</p>
<p>桌椅響，碗筷響，人羣騒動着，每個人的心裏都像壓着塊石頭，啊！煩悶！！一·二·三·罷考！</p>
<p>民立和大同的學生揭開了罷考的幕！中學怎樣？</p>
<p>！派代表和XX商量。</p>
<p>代表走出來了，走到XX先生身邊！高中的事和初中有什麽關係！在代表述出了罷考的原由之後，竟碰了個意想不到的大釘子，默然的走開。！XX中學仔獨！叱！叱！</p>
<p>各人的心弦·爲了騒動的空氣更加緊張起來。但是菜來了，人心也和緩了。飯吃過了，民立和大同的學生成羣的尋主考，但是尋不着。</p>
<p>銀鷄嗚，考時到，XX的學生拿着筆墨走到考場的門前。</p>
<p>！不許進去！</p>
<p>！XX中學偷卷子！</p>
<p>！跑出來！</p>
<p>關門！</p>
<p>砰！考場的大門關了。</p>
<p>主考跑出門來了，一把砂立刻撤下，監考是跌在地下，皮包扔到一丈之外。罷考終於實現了！</p>
<p>XX中學的學生終於因爲人少的原故，抱屈的走開了。</p>
<p>！好學生？</p>
<p>！模範生？</p>
<p>！終算是來了三日，功德圓滿吧？</p>
<p>一陣的譏笑聲，拍掌聲，送中學的學生出了大門。</p>
<h3>紅蘿蔔鬚</h3>
<p>— Jules　Kenaro作　林取譯</p>
<p>銀幣</p>
<p>三（續）</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚！怎麽？你看在這裏啊。</p>
<p>雷辟克家的·你看在這裏啊。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚！給我看看。</p>
<p>雷辟克家的！你也給我看看。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚（他把他的銀幣拿出來。雷辟克家的也把她的拿出來。紅蘿蔔鬚把兩個貨幣拈來拈去，比較着，預備他的話。）！這眞奇怪。你在什麽地方尋到的，媽媽？我是在這條路上，在梨樹底下尋到的。我起初在那上面走過二十遍，都不曾發見。它在那衷發着亮。我初還以爲是一塊紙或是一朶白色　花呢。我當時不敢拿它。這大槪是某天我在草地上滾着頑時，從我的袋子裏落下來的。請你　下身來，媽媽，看看它藏着的地方罷。它大可因爲曾經便得我煩亂而自豪呢。</p>
<p>雷辟克家的！你的話，我不否認。可是我在你另外的一件大衣裏面尋出你所失的銀幣了。我雖屢次和你說過，但你換衣裳時，還是忘記把你袋子裏的東西拿出來。我想給你一個守秩序的敎訓。我讓你去尋，使你知道利害。誰知尋得什麽東西的，因爲你現在不止有一個銀幣反而有兩個銀幣了。好啦，你現在一身都是錢啦。凡是好的事結果總是好的，可是我得告訴你金錢不會使人得到幸福的。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚！那麽，我可以去頑了嗎，媽媽？</p>
<p>雷辟克家的！當然啦。你去頑罷，你現在正是當頑的年齡呢。把你的兩個銀幣去罷。紅蘿蔔鬚！啊！媽，我有一個就够了，並且連這一個都請你替我收着，等我要用的時候再給我。這樣我就喜歡你啦。</p>
<p>雷辟克家的！不，賬要算得淸楚，感情才會好的。你去藏奸你的兩個銀幣罷。你敎父給你的那個和另外你在梨樹下尋着的一個，兩個都應當歸你的，祇要那業主不來追究的話。這錢究竟是誰遺下的呢？我腦壳都想空了。你呢，你没有猜着是誰嗎？</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚！没有，我可不管這些了。我明天再去想它。等會見，媽媽，並且謝謝你。雷辟克家的！等一等！這不是園丁的嗎？</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚！你願意我就跑去問問他着嗎？</p>
<p>雷辟克家的！站在這　，乖　，帮帮我。讓我們再想想看。你的父親有那樣年紀了，是不會這麽疏忽的。你的姐姐把她省下的錢放在　滿裏面。你的哥哥是没有把錢遺失的餘裕的，他手上有一個錢就會馬上用掉了。結局，也許是我遺落的呢。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚！媽媽，這事是不會有的··你是那樣一絲不亂的。</p>
<p>雷辟克家的！有時候大人也會像小孩一樣弄錯呢。這事以後再查罷。總之，這個銀幣是祗和我有關的。我們現在不去說它了。你不必再擔心了·，去頑罷，乖賣，不要走得太遠了，等</p>
<p>我去看一看我那做針線的桌子的抽斗罷。（未完）</p>

<h3>兩件痛心事</h3>
<p>— 賡</p>
<p>頭天報上纔看見「日本學生羣赴東北，實現探險調查」的新聞（乃屢見不一見之新聞），翌日「留日學生被迫歸國」的大標題，又明朗朗的一個的映入</p>
<p>眼簾，剌入心頭，眞氣煞我也。</p>
<p>被迫歸國的内容，略謂，身在異域，念及日軍進攻祖國，慘殺同胞，炮轟都市，難民遍野，故有難民救濟會之組織，不料遽遭日方當局嫉妒，先後被捕者達四十人以上，嚴詢毒打，頗有因傷重而死者，雖中有釋者，旋被迫歸國云云。Ｊ</p>
<p>探險調查的内容，略謂，「華北停戰後，日本各地，爭相組織滿洲考察團，勢如泉湧，所經鐵道輪船，槪予免費優待，登記考察團，巳達八萬七千，人數達三百五十萬以上，中以學生爲最多，有所謂學生探險隊者，隊員八千名，分經濟，地理測騐，鑛，林業等調查，七月一日，分赴東北云云。」</p>
<p>我們把上面的新聞，兩兩對照，除了麻木不仁，死無心肝者，以及賣國救</p>
<p>「辱」認賊作父的漢奸以外，縱是萬事慣作阿家翁者，對此也難假痴假聾，縱是遠處歐西，稍具人類同情心的第三者，對此亦必憤憤不平，何况是所謂的國人？何况是所謂的同胞？我想至少至少也應感覺到，前者是我們的痛心史的一頁，恰恰又是日人得意事的一幕，後者是日人侵略東北，澈底行爲之正幕的開始，恰恰又是我們淪亡四省，萬刧難復之基宅的造成，我之留學生，是拿着白銀換成金柰去留學的留學生，平時旣被人賜以鮮民同等之待遇，臨變更一批一批的被人惡狠狠地鞭趕回來，個個弄得焦頭爛額，體無完膚，人之考察團，是空着兩隻赤手來調查我寳藏府庫的考察團，來去自由，如入無人之境，還不說（此恐不僅東北此時如此）而旦出入還有漢奸們的跪接與跪送，俾成千成萬的天使上賓們，人人都得歸則滿載錦榮，留可擇肥而噬，趾高氣揚，不可一世。嗚呼，天下平事，古今痛心史，寧復尙有逾於此者！</p>
<h3>中了航空獎金前一夕</h3>
<p>— 飄萍</p>
<p>摸着袋袋，只是空空如也，毫無分文，急得眼花撩亂，七竅生烟，打開報紙一看，航空頭獎得主王飄萍，這一來，喜得眉飛色舞，於是三一三十一，四一二十二撥起算盤珠，如何使用這些銀錢，累得坐臥不安，茶飯無心，眞如無鍚人打話江尖嘴上團團轉了，</p>
<p>劈頭第一個問題，當然要僱一個保鑣，因爲現在可不比從前了　纏萬貫留起八字閧鬍，儼然一富家翁也，跑江河的好漢　少不得　　　江　　　　　們暗算起來，有個三長四短，那可不是頑的，所以衡情度理，這個保鑣是萬萬少不得的，不過他的武藝，總要高强，十八件武藝，件件皆精，射撃本領，尤當百步穿楊，這樣，我可傲視闊步，而無外顧之憂了，私計巳决，准定明日寫封信給大亨的朋友，聘請一位有名的鑣師。</p>
<p>鑣師請好，還住在鴿籠式的亭子樓裏，似乎不成體統，於是洋房又不能不造了，樓閣亭榭，應有盡有，曲徑小橋，摩不設備齊全，至於假山奇花，更當多　　致，不過要是外來有人參　，　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　第三個問題，自然購買汽車了，除非不買，買則兩部，一輛備作自己代步，其餘一輛，奉獻夫人，俾得日常到跳舞塲或影戲院裏去需用，一方不惜巨金，物色美女，姿容娟秀者，一股惱兒充作後房，於是擁妻抱妾，擠眉弄眼，吃西餐，上舞場，眞是開心煞人，夜裏打打麻雀，高興時，不妨逛逛窑子，至於對待婢奴僕僮，自然格外壧厲，誰敢說聲不是，馬上鞭之以籐條，</p>
<p>記得没有得獎時，身爲窮措大之一員，跑到富人家裏去募捐到處碰壁，受其白眼，猶爲小事，甚且被其如狼如虎之門役　之戶外，現在老夫自　其途，那可也要煊赫一時了，要是有這殷人來糾緾，定當一毛不拔，而且火駡其山門　也算出出我這　　。</p>
<p>其實面團團旣爲關少，理當多備西裝，以壯威嚴，化妝品零躉批來，頭髮梳得平平的，香汕塗個半斤八兩，光可鑒人，花領結，黑皮鞋，渾身全新，鼻樑上架之以眼鏡，於是風度翩翩，誰家少女不爲之傾倒，哈哈今日之我幾忘昨日之我了</p>
<p>可是以前的窮朋友不容說一槪割絕了誰不識相來嚕嚕囌囌，莫怪我忘恩負義，或大加申斥，或揚掌報之以耳光，横豎有了錢什麽都可不怕，法官要論公評理，那末暗暗的送他一千或五百，自然可風平浪靜，彼窮措大者其將奈何我</p>
<p>但是這幾天來，平津風雲，非常　急，一旦矮子眞的殺將進來，江南縱然花花世界，恐怕不見得妥當了，還是買</p>

<h3>錢的追求</h3>
<p>— 傑克</p>
<p>走出大門向着馬路上看去，人們都是這樣的忙碌和奔波電車裏一車車的戴過去，送回來的人。汽車黃包車ＸＸ都是風馳電掣的··往來如梭的，不知他們忙些什麽？天天如是，年年如此，没有一個時刻或者停滯着的。</p>
<p>有人說他們都不是爲「錢」？談到這個「錢」字，也和愼敏先生講的那個「情」字，有一模一樣的神秘和搆造。不過錢」是萬能的東西！牠能在字宙裏操着極大的威權，所以人們無時無刻不在追求着，迷戀着，利用牠極大的威權來使用在社會上。牠能使人們歡喜！也能給人們快樂！人們做不到的事她能替你做到，辦不好的事牠也能替你辦好。！國際上有了牠能强國，一家人有了她能夠</p>
<p>團圓，一個人有了他就可以隨心所欲出進自如了。反之國際上無牠就被欺侮，一家人無他不怕你是夫婦，父子，都會分散的，一個人無牠門前無路。所以牠是很直道的，很温柔而且能體貼人的，很慈善的。不過她也很勢利的··很無情而且强暴的·，很不客氣的呵！</p>
<p>「錢」在社會上有絕大的魔力，任何人有了他，會生兒，能操縱一切的一切。假使不善於她就會替你開倒車，所以人們拚命的追求他</p>
<p>一部份的人們，因爲追求不順意而自槍者·，一部份靑年們，追求心太大，竟起挺而走險者·，更有甚於同室操戈者·，亦頗不乏人。這正所謂『要「錢」不要命』的話了。統而言之不外乎都是爲追</p>
<p>求「錢」的象徵啊！</p>
<p>這個「錢」字的組織，其意義是二只「戈」看着」塊黃金，你也想要，我也要</p>
<p>拿，但是金子祗是一塊·，不是兩條，你也拿不去，我也取不來，必須你要拿或我要取時·，那决定是要爭打動起干戈來！所以談到要「錢」是非爭打不可了。國際間追求「錢」打大戰，竟致亡國。國内追求「錢」打小戰，幾要滅種。（這··我說的種不是種族，是人種，不過現在也差不多是種族了。）一家人追求</p>
<p>「錢」打架，把老子的頭都打破，一個人追求「錢」拿起刀來去通人，那天看不到爲要「錢」發生的不景氣象呢？</p>
<p>俗話有句··「人無「錢」不行，鳥無翼不飛」！其意義表示有「錢」隨處可以去，無「錢」就好像無脚似的一動也不能動了。</p>
<p>那麽「錢」是不能不要，你不去爭，誰送給你來？</p>
<p>『不，我的主張是要而不爭，爭而不打，是要「錢」的唯一道德。』</p>
<h3>侮辱</h3>
<p>— 蘋</p>
<p>「媽的·！你·····</p>
<p>受了一頓咒駡，結果，是他的拳頭馬上就飛到我的胸前來了！</p>
<p>我的腦壳子一陣的昏迷。</p>
<p>當然，我有什麽說得，祇有走了，爲着避那暴力的襲來。</p>
<p>這時候，世界巳不是早晨的那樣淸靜。</p>
<p>侮辱，暴力，屈服···都潮湧在週遭·我迷惘在路途之上。</p>
<p>我是怎樣竭力的冷靜自己的頭腦，但這一頓侮辱，咒駡，拳頭，····總還是不能忘記。唉！朋友啊！實際上，是胸部在痛着了··當然的，我怎能忘記呢？！</p>
<p>我剛走到碼頭時，心中便在戰慄着了。心想，這次或可僥倖的罷？</p>
<p>没有辦法，硬着頭皮·走到收票處。那收票的！那混賬東西，便向我上下瞧着。</p>
<p>「先生，對不起，這次没有帶錢」我恭聲下氣地求他。</p>
<p>「什麽？没有帶錢，那不行！」</p>
<p>「唉！先生！我實在是没有錢」我還是求他。</p>
<p>哀求，在世界巳不是早晨的那樣淸靜的時候，！那不行！</p>
<p>買了票上去的和提了皮包上去的人們，都投我以輕視的眼光。他們存着看熱閙的心理，等這件事的結束，然後，</p>
<p>和作爲他們過江的消遣談話資料。</p>
<p>我的臉皮巳經很厚了，我並不畏懼這人們給我的輕視，爲着要過江，祗有求他們。</p>
<p>然而，不行，始終不行！冷冷的面孔，我巳是第五個瞧見。</p>
<p>穿西裝的先生，走過去了，没有問</p>
<p>不干與的人也都來瞧着這塲活劇。有什麽辦法，我没有錢，不。弱者受了侮辱，欺凌····</p>
<p>我像小羊一般的走了。我不能反抗，但總不能不有毫絲的憤懣。</p>
<p>「哼！没有錢便不能過江嗎？」</p>
<p>「什麽？你····</p>
<p>朋友啊！收票的那傢伙便是一個拳頭打來了。</p>
<p>哼！拳頭，一個飛來的拳頭！我生了二十來歲，這是我第一次遭受的！侮辱！</p>
<p>我怎樣呢？侮辱，走！</p>
<p>走到街上，····我不想這些了！一個拳頭，這對於我們，又算的什麽呢！？我們的骨頭，生成的便是遭打的喲！但是·，我們終不能没滅了！愈壓迫愈反抗的存在。不過，我倒替那打我的傢伙可憐，他！在社會上，又算得什麽呢？他也同樣的受着侮辱啊！他來侮辱我，那是他被賣了自己。我的靈魂没有受到侮辱呵！我還有我的價値存在。唉！胸問，還在！痛····</p>
<h3>無線電是亡國利器</h3>
<p>— 殲夷</p>
<p>者看了這個題目，一定覺得很奇怪，因爲無綫電是近代物質文明，科學發達的最新結晶，由於無線電的發明，而予人們以下少利益，每個國家都恃以爲軍事上交通上的利器，怎能說它是亡國的利器呢？並且歐美各國的無線電事凿都比中國發達，怎麽他們不亡國，反因而日　富强，爲什麽到中國來，便變成亡國的利器呢？</p>
<p>無論一件什麽事，總逃不好壞兩方面的。　如現代種種科學的新發明，在好的一方面，固然是科學愈發達，物質愈文明，人們便得到不少的享受·，但是從壞的一方面看來，却是科學愈發達，殺人愈便利，人類愈臻野蠻。無綫電亦是如此，善利用之，則日臻富强，不善利用之，便是亡國的利器。</p>
<p>在歐美各國，差不多每家都有無棧電的裝置，他們的目的是要使全國消息靈通，所以一有重要時事，即由無線電台播送，一霎時全國的人民都知道了。其次便是請名人演講，使人民增加智識·，娛樂是最不注意的一種目的。但是中國恰與此相反，娛樂是最要的目的，每天所播送的不外是彈詞，灘簧，滑稽對白，小曲，中西戲劇的歌詞等等，使人意志消沉，墮落的娛藥的節目。至於名人的演講，或重要時事的報告，則確實難得聽見！</p>
<p>現在的一班資產階級和有閑階級的人們，差不多都有無線電的裝置，因爲從前還要走也來才能得到視聽之樂，現在只要裝有無線電，連大門都不必出，就可以得到種種的娛樂，於是一機在耳，萬念俱空，鎭日的在家陪着妻妾，聽聽無綫電，恣情取樂，完全暴露了醉生夢死的劣根性，什麽國難，在他們的腦海中連影子都没有了！唉！幸虧現在中國還不能人人裝置無線電，否則人人陶醉在娛樂的雰氛中，國家事豈不是没有人來管，此時不亡，更待何時？！</p>

<h3>店員通訊</h3>
<p>何去何從</p>
<p>編者先生·，</p>
<p>你是知　界的急先鋒·又是我們的遵師·，我很崇·而欽偑的。我有一件切身問題久相來請敎？</p>
<p>又恐怕我的學問太差，使先生難於入目·，然不請敎先生·終没有人來替我解决的·今天鼓盡了我的勇氣，才把我的問題和環境，寫成這封信，想你一定同情我的。我是一個有家不能歸的可憐者·從前曾在鄉村小學，握過兩年粉筆，因農村經濟破產，匪共横行，故前年春，離開了我慈愛的故鄉，到這繁榮之海上謀生。未幾承友人之介紹，投入兵工廠作工，詎料命途多舛，未及一年，「一二八」事件發生，接看我的飯碗碎了</p>
<p>。那時我又不能回農村去只得四處覓事。唉，在此人才過剩的上海，結果使我失望。遂從此過我的失業生活了。那時我有一個親家，在此開一個小小印刷店，見我流離秩所，呌我帮帮他的忙·，實情他店中本不要人的，加之我又是一個外行。所以我的生活費，就只有我的零用錢了。彼時正閙着失業恐慌的時候，故不得不答允下來。我在這一年多中，耐苦努力的鬥奮，不料到現在，一點道理也没有，使我灰心消極而感到厭世。光陰荏苒，不　得快要兩年了，雖我的親家没有什麽閑話，可是長安雖好，終非久住之家。不得不謀有以發展我的前途了。今我有兩條出路，寫在下面，百二十分之誠懇，請你替我揀一條吧！</p>
<p>㈠我在兵廠作工的時候，把我血汗所換來的工資，省吃省用，積儲起來，今年連本帶利，大槪有百餘元左右。我想把牠作基本金，來做點小生意，要稍有發達，並於社會有益的，不知做些什麽生意才好？</p>
<p>㈡我處此困難期中，曾經托人四處謀事，我有一表兄服務某軍參謀處，日前曾經來函呌我去作事·，什麽文書上中士，儘可設法，不過薪金附火食費，只有，五六元一月。我現在想去，恐我的雙親着急，因軍隊裏多麽殘暴呵！又恐我的學問，不能勝任。先生，你看我的字和學問，能不能夠勝任其事？是否我的前途，從此到可發展了？先生負有困難無不解决的榮舉，想我的問題你一定能解决的，敬請撰安。谷經綸謹上編者按··在這資本主義巳經具體化的現世，經濟落後的我國，說也可憐得很。一般名爲資本家的人，雖則一方面因爲敵不過外國的資本家，眼見他一個個倒下來但是他們對於國内的窮人却很能運用「長袖善舞」的政策，使你無路可走·，看來不至向歸於盡，是不會罷手的了！你想將你積下來的百餘元·作爲基金，自己去做企業。不是我們掃你的興，勸你不必。這區區之數，能有什麽能耐呢？還要想「較有發展」</p>
<p>益社會，眞是盲人瞎馬了。你還是找個隨便什麽事做做，拿了乾的，吃了濕的</p>
<p>罷·，這一百餘金，留作萬一失業時的補助費，白丢了是不値得的。</p>
<p>至於軍隊裏去當文書，照你的來信，文筆學問，都還可以使得。高級的不能包，中士書記，是一定可以勝任的。論理軍隊生活，是别饒興趣的，而且也應當較有意義，從此得個出路，也很可能。不過中國的軍隊，那就不能一槪而論了··有意義而爲國爲民的，當然也有··但是變相的强盜，也是不少。我們寗可餓死，决不能去做强盜。所以你的第二條路，原則上是好的，不過你應當把這軍隊的内容，予以考量罷了。</p>
<p>如其考量的結果，也不能去，那末再候機會罷，好在令親家並無閑話呢！一個人的一生，當然不能蛇蹉過去，怛是「硬幹」和「性急」的結果，或許非但不能進步，還要倒退，也說不定的呀！</p>

<h3>紅綠燈下（六）</h3>
<p>— 禧林</p>
<p>「哈人？」這是房裏的聲音，淸脆可耳。</p>
<p>門門開一半，剛夠他的眼睛可以看到一個妖艷的女人躺在沙發裏的姿態手裏把一本白衣血浪的書放在　下「對不住，這裏的一位先生在家嗎？我是住在這裏亭子問姓季的。」他</p>
<p>不甚自然地做着手勢。</p>
<p>「哦，李先生嗎？」有什麽事麽？我們楊先生出去了，不要緊，房裏請坐！」</p>
<p>都市的少婦慣是善於交際，口齒伶俐的，石喬被這大方而又出乎意外親熱口吻羞怯起來，仍是站在門檻邊不敢進來，三姨太站了起來，也不喊阿珍倒茶獻烟，自己又把半門的門關着，讓石喬的身體塞進來。她早知石喬的來意，便自己先說了··</p>
<p>「眞對不住呢！好在我們有這兩間大房子也儘夠了，後面一間做客廳，阿珍！！我家的大姐就在樓梯後面那間小房子裏頓好了！扛仗眞討厭呢，李先生，是不？她歪着頭，並不要得到回答，只是她平常所研究得一種迷人的媚態之一。實際上石喬坐在這軟綿綿的臥房裏，呼吸着一種豪富的由美婦人所　染過的空氣裏，早就把不住那顆煩亂的心兒漸次地被溶解下來了，石喬忘記了他所要說的話，儘管望着那湖色的窗廉發呆。忽然一枝烟觸到他的手，送烟來的另外一隻手好像蛇皮一般油滑而有冷感的嫩皮使他覺到一種戰慄。</p>
<p>（五）這與美了多麽隔膜啊！</p>
<p>今天的戰爭是更劇烈了，整個的上海在搖蕩着，像一隻暴風中的破船。門前的一排梧桐樹上新蓋上了一層由閘北飛落來的火燒的灰燼，風一吹，這些灰燼往往要迷糊路人的雙眼。</p>
<p>立哈洛夫出買菜去了，美子獨自坐在門前小園庭的第三級石階上，沐洛着被霧氣所量的不大明凈的太陽光，遠雷似的　陣陣砲響，時刻使她不能忘記日俄戰爭時的慘象。她眞不明白人類爲仠麽要戰爭泥？戰爭對於什麽有好處呢？犧牲了無數頭　而博得的所謂太和魂的光榮，而我太和魂的女兒　不是一樣地天涯淪落！她却無意中輕輕的自語了一聲·「唉，立哈洛天的沙皇！」</p>
<p>沉靜的馬路上響近了幾個靑年的急促的脚步聲·生　勃勃的從門前朝西　去，忽然當中一個高個子向她很高興的滑稽地行了一個學手軍禮，並且「哈　！」的喊了一聲，便經過了。這是李石喬，顯然有着什麽熱烈的工作在忙着</p>
<p>。！！他也要去參加前線嗎，美子想。她本來對於戰爭，無論什麽戰爭根本就厭惡，但中國的應該爭口氣，她却好像有種油然的同情，可惜她只有理上的同情，而没有找出明確的理由。</p>

<h3>大鼻子先生大談美容術</h3>
<p>— 華明</p>
<p>醜男子要不到女朋友化妝術可以挽回厄運大鼻子先生傑美杜倫，素性詼諧，在他們同冷面滑裴斯開登合演的「大他敎授」·一片問世之後，詼諧之名，更稱著於一時。近日傑美每到米高梅公司辦事時，必定先到化妝室中緊閉了窗戶在裏面逗留半小時以上，及開門出來，面上粉痕累累，頭上香味觸鼻，頭髮上面光滑滑的，顯然是敷了一層油，尤其有趣的，是他天生的一隻蓋世無雙的大鼻子上面，粗而又大的汗毛孔中塡滿了粉。喜歡陶氣的著名頑童賈克古伯，這天淸早就到米高梅公司裏去，一聲不響的躱在化妝室中。傑美到了公司，搖搖擺擺的跑進化妝室，對了鏡子大施其撲粉點胭脂的工作。賈克古伯完全看見，並且頑皮的賈克偷偷的攝了一張照片，給大家瞧，於是好菜塢對於大鼻先生都發生來一種笑談。</p>
<p>但是傑美近日的化妝格外用功了，有許多人因之詢問，他爲什麽效法這小姑娘的技倆，米高梅公司中的辦事員說，化妝室中的香粉二天尙要費去一盒，也找了傑美說話，而傑美却很從容的發表他所以妝的原因，並且他極力的勸男子們要化妝。</p>
<p>傑美說··「好萊塢的男子，要是没有幾個女朋友，是要被人家笑的。但是我到了好萊塢之後，從來没有一位女子說要和我做朋友的。我看看别人，好像却爾法雷希佛萊加利賈雷等，每次出外都有女朋友。我有些莫明其妙，同我在一起工作的米高梅同事之中，女明星很多，但是她們没有一個肯和我做朋友的。最近我回去問我的妻子，她說我的鼻子油光光的太醜了，那裏有女孩子肯跟我做朋友，從這大起，我知道醜男子要不到女朋友的，必須設法拿醜面掩飾去了才好。」</p>
<p>「後來我才想到了一個絕妙的辦法，就是用化妝術掩飾我的醜態。我在家中怕妻子，所以每天到公司中才實行我的計畫。果然我的方法靈騐異常，現在我巳經有了三個女朋友了。」</p>

<p>聯華二廠拍製中之「小玩意」劇裏角色，除人之外，尙有猪羊鷄鴨狗等，但猪羊鷄鴨都無戲做，惟狗須有好幾個鏡頭單獨表演。日前，開拍葉大嫂避戰來滬所住之貧民區外景，狗是應該跑過一條獨木小橋，狗導演韓蘭根指導牠拍戲，牠戰戰兢兢的走上小橋，看情形是很胆怯，當衆人注目時，撲通一聲，竟掉落河中，韓蘭根見其愛犬落水，</p>
<p>恐遭滅頂，於是口中喊着「來福」</p>
<p>狗名）便身體投河，迨將來福救上，落水狗遍體淋漓，狗導演韓蘭根也一式一樣，比對起來倒有點</p>
<p>（二）阮玲玉面前馬桶</p>
<p>日前，　聯華二廠拍取「小玩意」第十五場老葉家景，其中有一近景，爲葉大嫂（阮玲玉飾）掩着鼻子在吃油炸臭豆腐乾，阮玲玉演時巳令人忍唆不禁，可是在孫導演（瑜）喊了Out之後，圍觀者更哄然大笑，有的人是莫明其妙，造仔細觀察後，纔覺得確是一宗滑稽事，原來不知是誰乘人不備時將一小馬桶玩具之一擺在阮玲玉面前。所以便成了對着馬桶吃臭豆腐乾，雙料其臭矣。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>評「現代一女性」</h3>
<p>— 史澤永</p>
<p>在大幅的廣告上，牠告訴我說··信一部片子的編劇與主演，是艾霞女士一身兼任的·，這在中國的電影場中，的確開了女朋星自任編劇主角的新紀元了！所以不侫爲了這個原故便專誠的跑到中央大戲院，去賞覽艾霞女士傑作的「現代一女性」。</p>
<p>這一部片子的寓意。牠是諷剌着現代的一般摩女性們。它借着地產公司的女職員萄萄，來盡量的揭發現代的一般女性們的時代病，和虚榮心·，牠並且還予以一般靑年們的盲譚自由戀愛者，作一個强有力的當頭棒喝。</p>
<p>這部片子的意義是很正確的。但是還有幾處小問題，可以商榷商榷。萄萄她不過是地產公司的一個女職員，每月的薪水，以最多的數目來說，不過七十元。（此由於余冷在會計處算賬時證明的）後來，雖經了經理加多三十元一月總共不過百元左右。而她的寓所中却佈置得如此富麗堂皇·，况且只有她一個人居住，不應該這們奢侈的，並且在失業之後，手面顯出了拮据之狀，於此可知她從來是非富有的。一個男人而有充任編輯的資格，我想余冷的學問知識，一定是很好的了·但是我於畫面上觀到他騙他的妻子，終日和萄萄作樂·，一個讀書明理何竟胡塗至此？及後，萄萄的犯罪，與妻子之離婚，這時候予以他這麽兩個重大的打撃與剌激，他應該猛然的省悟了，然而不，但他却沈淪在賭博，在女色，在狂舞之中，結果他造成了犯罪之起因。所以這幾點，似乎是一個受過敎育的人不應該有這許多差誤的。質之艾霞女士，以爲如何？</p>
<p>這部片子，好的地方，却也未尙没朱秋痕近影及其簽名</p>
<p>（滬江攝顧文宗贈）</p>
<p>有。如幾個靈活的鏡頭之運用，的確很可歌偑的。還有幾幕小穿插也很好。如余冷初至萄萄家，萄萄以手捫住余冷之眼睛，接着來了幾個甜蜜之吻，很熱烈而緊漲。又如萄萄把余冷的妻子玉如的照片，拿起筆來畫眉毛畫鬍子，活現出一個示受拘泥的放浪的女子。又如余冷騙妻子說參加國聯調查團，書面上很滑稽而又發噱。這幾點亦是値得稱許的。至於說到演員的表情，艾霞女士，是很吻合身份而最成功的··可是幾幕接吻的表情，似乎太過大了。至於孫敏呢？有幾幕太呆滯了··如對萄萄之愛的表情，似乎欠熱烈。小動作倒還成功·與『春水情波』相比較，好像是在進步了！至於徐莘園的表情是很深刻的，可是露面很少！又如唐月靑女士的王安琳，也還可取，其餘的配角，亦都還適當，</p>
<h3>評「現代一女性」</h3>
<p>— 嘯雲</p>
<p>在這新陳代謝的現社會底下，靑年們受着聲色的誘惑，不時有濃厚的感情衝動。可是他們没有堅强的理智，往往抑制不住慾念·，於是社會上平添了不少新的悲劇。他們這種弱點，的確應該補救，他們誤入這種歧途，實在需要指導。「現人一女性」便是抓住這個題材的影片。但是牠並没有盡了牠應盡的責任，因爲反面文章實在做得太多了，太畸重了！</p>
<p>導演技巧，有時很顯出他的經騐，</p>
<p>不過整個的劇情鬆懈，始終不能緊張觀衆的心弦。畫面上發展，顯然不夠充實·，倒是字幕給了不少帮助。鏡頭很見活動，光綫也尙柔和。游園一塲，頗具風景的美，萄萄家裏的佈景很美，但嫌過於偉大，監牢裏的墻壁，太不避「假」的</p>
<p>嫌疑了！</p>
<p>表演最努力的是艾霞，較「舊恨新的」確裏當進步了不少。孫敏做戲，太愁戲做，過猶不及，似乎退步了。謝雲舫始終只會呆板，放了很多的好機會不表現，眞可惜！唐月靑平平，徐莘園很好。</p>
<p>還有片中幾點疎忽的小疵，似乎也有提出商榷的必要··</p>
<p>㈠五如留書出走，抱了小孩同去，以後在律師處，又不見小孩踪跡·，離婚時作何處置，將後怎生下落，全没交代淸楚。</p>
<p>㈡玉如給余冷的信，說「小寳常常說，爸爸怎麽不回來？」戲中小寳纔祗幾個月的小孩，他怎能會說話呢？</p>
<p>㈢余冷沈淪後的生活，塲面太簡，他怎樣會犯罪的，不容易使人明白。</p>
<p>㈣法庭上太少秩序尊嚴，被告可以自由走動，直接責問而不受積極的干涉嗎？</p>
<h3>觀「現代一女性」</h3>
<p>— 喻家卿</p>
<p>在國產影片中，編劇兼主角是少有的，尤其女明星··但我們的小鴿子（艾霞）竟能打破此例。</p>
<p>劇情是這樣的，述一個女職員萄萄，愛了一個新聞記者余冷，一面整日與與他游公園，玩考而夫球，跳舞，一面且拒絕了她公司中經理史芳華的愛。經理恨透了，把她退職了。余冷因爲荒廢了職務，報館也就停了他的職務。萄萄因爲做了喪失人格的事，竊了史芳華的一張四千元的支票被芳華控告於法庭，她終於嘗了鐵窗風味，一年後，萄萄期滿出獄了，她得女友的勸導，她覺悟了，她走上光明的大道去了。</p>
<p>劇情是没有什麽緊張的，她祇告訴我們，「戀愛」與「金錢」的密切的關係，全片中所謂愛的憧憬，靈的交嗚，只有是「吻」吧了。</p>
<p>導演比在「琵琶春怨」中成功了，技巧上也有特殊的成績，但是總免不了有些小疵點·，如法庭中的佈置，太立體化了，萄萄在法庭中辯論，未免有些太放肆了。</p>
<p>演員如艾霞前半部太熱烈浪漫，後半部的表情自然逼眞尤其是在法庭中。與牢獄中。孫敏太軟弱。徐莘園尙稱合職，其餘演員，均平平而巳。</p>
<p>攝影，光綫，角度均置配得淸晣適當。</p>
<h3>電影小說情海迴瀾ＲｅｕｎｉｏｎｉｎＶｉｅｎｎａ（八）</h3>
<p>— 子歸譯</p>
<p>（注意）昨日登載者係第八段應在今日所載之後特此更正</p>
<p>魯道爾夫說道「你要小心些，不要惹我生氣。你知道我們一族裏統通都犯一　狂怒病的，往往一發而不可遏止的。當然我不願將你的美　的鼻打破了，或是將你一個兩個牙齒打掉了送回你的丈夫去。」</p>
<p>愛倫娜瞪着眼看着他，很不信的說道「這眞奇怪了，亡命了十年受了多少恥辱和貧苦，你還當着法郎賣巧色夫還在勳勃隴宮裏做皇帝嗎？」</p>
<p>「不，我有的時候感覺着時代巳經變遷了，但是我現在看見了你還是那麽艷　，我就相信奥國並有什麽革命發生過。」魯道爾夫說完了，走近愛倫娜要想去吻她。但她忽然間反叛起來，呌他不要走近她。他呌她喝些香擯，提提興致，她亦不喝。而她呌他去到大飯廳裏和家人會會，他亦不去。他說他這次來維也納，是專誠來看她的，並不是來看那些老古董的。後來愛倫娜改變了方針，稱讚着他··她說「何不讓他們看看你還是這樣年輕美貎呢？并且你穿了這套白色的軍服，掛了許多動章，簡捷要使他們快樂死了！」</p>
<p>果然魯道爾夫聽見愛倫娜這樣一恭維，就很歡喜歡地答應給他們看一看。但是他出去了一回見，又回來了。他繼續着向愛倫娜說愛情的話，要想勾動她的舊情，但是　倫娜總是一味的推却。後來魯道爾夫又要她進臥房裏去，她不答應。他將她全身很命地狂吻着，她的喉嚨，她的肩膀，她的手臂等等，口裏喊着「愛倫娜，你如果能知道我怎樣捨不得你·，怎樣的早　夜想，時時刻刻不忘記你·，你的影像永久存在我的心裏，安慰着我，鼓　着我，使我崇拜·····」</p>
<p>「我現在己經和從前不同了，」愛倫娜掙脫了他的樓抱，立起來說。</p>
<p>「我不相信」，魯道爾夫說。</p>
<p>「那就因爲你不肯承認這最重要的一個事實，就是我巳經嫁了人，我亦很愛他。」</p>
<p>「你不要使我笑吧，」他說着走近前來，將她重新抱住了。他說「我們不必再辯論了，讓我們温温舊夢吧。生活的滋味是怎樣的，讓我們重新嘗嘗。」他把她緊緊地抱了起來，瘋狂似的吻着她的眼睛，她的嘴，她的喉嚨。她絕不抵抗，亦不加以反應。（未完）</p>

<h3>PANG BINGXUN'S TROOPS ORDERED TO CEASE ADVANCING TO CHAHAR</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Feng Yuxiang sent two telegrams to Ping last night and this morning, welcoming Song Zheyuan's return to Chahar. Tong Linge also sent a clever telegram to Song, roughly stating that since he was ordered to act as agent, the Chahar government affairs have been as usual and the handover procedures have been prepared. He hopes to return to Chahar soon to unload the responsibility, etc. The head of the Chahar Education Department will be selected from Ge Dingyuan and Zheng Dayu, and the head of the Construction Department will be selected from Zhang Jiyong and Zhang Weifan. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan visited He Yingqin last night to discuss everything. He indicated that as long as Feng telegrammed to cancel the Anti-Japanese Allied Army's name, the Central Government would appoint him as the Forest Reclamation Director-General without any problem. Song, representing Zhang Jiyong and others, will go to Chahar tomorrow to meet Feng and solicit his opinions. After Zhang returns to Ping, Song will first go to Zhangjiakou, and his 29th Army will then advance. Song convened Qin Dechun, Zhang Jiyong, Zhang Weifan, and others at his private residence this morning to discuss. Song will have a personal letter carried by Zhang to Feng, stating the Central Government's sincerity. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Pang Bingxun has now received orders to cease advancing to Chahar, temporarily suspend his original defense duties and await orders. Once the new defense area is designated, he will be reinstated. Pang's appointment as Commander of the Chahar Province Bandit Suppression is feared to be temporarily difficult to realize. Gao Lingbai is going to Beijing today to meet Wang Jingwei, delaying for one day, and then will turn to Jiangxi to meet Chiang Kai-shek. Sun Dianying telegraphed to summon his office director in Ping, Wang Shouxin, to Shacheng. Wang is going today. According to the discussion, Sun is eager to lead his troops to Qinghai for reclamation, but the departure fee is very large. He does not want to ask the Central Government for too much. After the official order is issued, he will lead his troops there. The righteous troops of Chahar Province, Deng Wen, Li Zhongyi, Fu Chun, and others, will be reorganized according to the number of people and guns as regular troops and be given salaries and provisions by the Military Branch Association. Zhang Renjie and Bao Gang's two divisions will be re-established after the designated defense area. Feng's troops, Ye Yuling, Zhang Lisheng, Tong Linge, and Ji Hongchang's four units will be completely reorganized by Song, with the highest-ranking officers appointed by Song. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Feng Zhanhai and Bao Gang's troops once came into contact in Wei County. After the local people's request, Bao's troops retreated to the northwest. Feng Zhanhai's troops took over the defense of Wei County last night, with the military headquarters set up inside the city. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Wang Ying, the bandit of Sui Province who was suppressed, was again appointed by Feng as the commander of the Cavalry Army. He once sent many party members secretly to Chahar West to gather major bandits, Yang Houxiao and others, to come to Chahar for reorganization, and told them that if the garrison intercepted them, they would divide into groups and harass in all directions. Sui Province is now strictly guarding against this. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan discussed the Chahar incident today. Some matters need to be discussed with the North China Military Branch Association and the Political Readjustment Committee, so no concrete decision has yet been made. It is also heard that whether Feng will be appointed as the Forest Reclamation Director-General, whether Sun Dianying will be the Qinghai Reclamation Director-General, and whether Fang Zhenwu will be the Chahar Province Garrison Commander still need to be discussed with Jiangxi. Because the Military Affairs Commission's principle regarding Chahar is that Feng and his party must leave Chahar. It is heard that Feng replied that as a member of the Central Committee, he naturally has the freedom to reside. Regarding this point, the efforts of those running between Ping and Chahar are still needed, so the Chahar affair cannot be as simple and straightforward as reported. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Dealing with the Puppet Army Issue</p>
<h3>JAPANESE SIDE STILL HAS NO REPLY</h3>
<p>Japanese Soldiers Seen in Shunyi</p>
<p>The Puppet Army of Ninghe Still Stationed in the City</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the disposal of the puppet army in Luan Dong, Yongjin has asked the Kwantung Army for instructions, but there has been no reply so far. It is rumored that the Japanese side will involve political issues, which is also unknown. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the Japanese army retreated from Shunyi, they still send troops back from time to time and intend to request that Huairou County, the non-war zone of Niulanshan, be under Liu Gui's jurisdiction. On the 14th, the Japanese Ministry of the Army announced that the Japanese army would withdraw from Qiancheng County, and the saying that the withdrawal would be completed within a week is due today. Looking at the recent situation, it seems difficult to achieve in the short term. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The puppet army of the Beining Line, Li Jichun's troops, previously demanded 100,000 yuan from the Liujiang Coal Mine. The Kai Coal Mine was quite afraid upon hearing the news and asked our side to quickly resolve the puppet army issue. However, since the Japanese army has not withdrawn so far, our side has not replied. The Hattori Brigade of the Japanese army in Tongdong has retreated towards Liaoning. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The situation in Lutai is the same as yesterday. Both sides are still confronting each other. The puppet army is in the Xiaoyan Village area, only seven or eight miles away from us. The puppet army of Ninghe is still stationed in the city without any change. The Japanese army in Tongzhou has withdrawn completely and all retreated to the territory of Sanhe County. The location of their station is unknown. In Shunyi, four or five Japanese soldiers came to Niulanshan from Miyun around 3:00 PM yesterday. After making no move, they retreated. The matter of electing the Public Security Bureau Chief was not mentioned either. Now, all the personnel in the Chamber of Commerce have taken refuge in the city. Eighteen Japanese soldiers came again to Tianjin today. After getting off the train, they went to the Japanese barracks immediately. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) As a result of the agreement between Huang Fu and He Yingqin, Bao Yulin, the current Director of the Public Security Bureau of Beiping, will be appointed as the Superintendent of the Special Police in the neutral zone. Currently, Bao's consent is being sought. (20th Telegraphic Dispatch)</p>
<p>Unbearable Plum Rains</p>
<h3>THE IMPENDING GREAT FLOOD DISASTER THE YANGTZE RIVER'S TORRENTIAL WATERS CONTINUE EASTWARD, WUHAN IN EXTREME PANIC</h3>
<p>Hankou Divides the Entire City into Five Sections for Flood Control, All Riverside Dikes Closed</p>
<p>The Jinshui Dam in Wuchang Collapsed, River Water Flows Backwards Unstoppably</p>
<p>Hunan and Zhejiang Both Experience Vast Flooding</p>
<p>Hankou Water Level Exceeds 44 Feet</p>
<p>(Hankou) The torrential waters of the Yangtze River have been rising continuously for days, flowing eastward. Hankou suddenly rose one foot on the 20th. The water level is 44 feet 1 inch, 5 feet 7 inches higher than in the 20th year of the Republic, and one zhang (10 feet) and 9 inches higher than in the 20th year of the Republic. The situation is even more serious, and people are in extreme panic. Li Fanyi, Director of the Construction Department, took the Jianguo steamship to Beijing on the evening of the 20th to attend the flood control conference. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>WATER ENTERS ROADSIDE UNDERPASSES AND TOILETS</h3>
<p>(Hankou) Sidewalks in the Japanese concession of Hankou are flooded, and water has entered roadside underpasses and toilets. Riverside flood control dikes were closed with earth on the morning of the 20th. The entire city is divided into five sections for flood control, with the city government, Public Security Bureau, dike construction association, farmers' association, security team, and others dividing and defending the sections. Mayor Wu Guozhen and Zhu Jiuying, a representative sent by the headquarters, both went to Zhanggong Dike for inspection on the 20th. Also, the flood control dikes in Kuaizi Street, Huoxiang Wharf, and Dingjia Wharf in Wuchang are being repaired urgently. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>THE BREACH OF THE WUCHANG DIKE HAS ALREADY CAUSED DISASTER</h3>
<p>(Hankou) Xia Douyin inspected the Wutai Dam on the 20th with the entire committee of the provincial government, and appointed flood prevention committee members and inspectors for each county, and stipulated the regular flood prevention expenses. The Jinshui New Dam in Wuchang County collapsed at 10:00 AM on the 20th, and the river water flowed backwards unstoppably, drowning seven or eight workers. This dam is related to several counties in southern Hubei, and the situation has already become a disaster. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) The rain here has not stopped yet. It is reported that many road surfaces and bridges have been destroyed in various places. In the past two days, land and water transportation throughout the province has mostly been at a standstill. Mountain floods have erupted in eastern Zhejiang, and rivers have overflowed in western Zhejiang. Although the submersion of fields and crops in various counties has not been reported in detail, there is no doubt that the signs of an unfortunate disaster have already formed. (20th Central News Agency Telegraph)</p>
<h3>PLUM RAINS CAUSE FLOODING ON STREETS</h3>
<p>(Hangzhou) Plum rains are causing trouble in eastern Zhejiang. The water in the streets of Tonglu is five or six feet deep. The water outside the city of Jiande is four or five feet deep. Lanxi is low-lying, with water five or six feet deep. Fuyang streets are higher, but the water outside the city is vast. The Dahua ship stopped on the 20th, and the Zhenxing and Qianjiang ships will also stop today and tomorrow if the rain does not stop. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>HUNAN PROVINCE FLOODS REACH TWENTY COUNTIES</h3>
<p>(Changsha) Floods have reached more than twenty counties. He has sent Tang Youyue and Zhang Fuchen to supervise the flood control work in the lakeside area. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>FOREIGN MINISTER LUO RETURNS FROM LEAVE</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign Minister Luo arrived at the ministry on the morning of the 20th and returned from leave, and attended the Executive Yuan meeting. (20th Central News Agency Telegraph)</p>
<h3>FU ZUOYI RETURNS TO TAIYUAN</h3>
<p>(Taiyuan) Fu Zuoyi returned to Taiyuan from Ping on the afternoon of the 20th and is scheduled to visit Yan at the riverbank on the morning of the 21st to report everything and make requests. Another inch of rain fell in Taiyuan City this afternoon. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>HAN FUQU RETURNS TO JINAN</h3>
<p>Yu Xuezhong Returns to Tianjin in the Same Train</p>
<p>(Beiping) Han Fuqu took a special train back to Jinan at 3:40 this morning. Han went out around 11:00 PM last night to bid farewell to various parties before going directly to the station. Yu Xuezhong returned to Tianjin in the same train as Han. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han Fuqu arrived in Jinan at 5:50 PM. Various dignitaries welcomed him at the station. Han said that he dare not be optimistic about the future of North China. If he has a way, the Northeast is not impossible in the future. Otherwise, there are still many difficulties. Internally, every war, whether won or lost, increases the number of troops, and there is no source of funding, which is not good for the situation. All parties are overly complimentary to Shandong, but if a teacup is broken, even if it is still good, it is useless. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yu Xuezhong told reporters that the disposal plan for Li Jichun's troops is far from the topic. Li requested to be reorganized into an army, but we only allowed to be reorganized into a brigade at the highest limit. As for the special police brigade, it was decided not to do it due to funding issues, that is, to slightly rectify and train the public security police in each county, without increasing the budget. Then, the militia can be rectified and trained to defend the locality. The loss of the nineteen counties in the war zone has been reported to be tens of millions of yuan. Those that have not been reported are more than that. The central government decided to raise 10 million yuan to carry out relief, but there is only this plan at present. It is still a long way off when this money will be raised. Xiong Xiling came and planned to raise one million yuan in this province to carry out emergency relief, which is considered to be taking one's own flesh to mend one's own sores, which is not a good strategy. The spring grain and various surcharges are decided to be exempted. Whether the autumn will be exempted depends on the future situation. The rumor that the mayor of Tianjin will be replaced is not something I heard in Ping, I think it is the effect of the atmosphere. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>JIANG AND CAI GO TO QUANZHOU FOR INSPECTION</h3>
<p>(Fuzhou) Jiang Guangnai arrived in Xiamen on the Haicheng ship on the morning of the 18th and went to Zhangzhou to meet Cai Tingkai, and then took the ship to the province. Chen Mingshu stayed in Hong Kong, and Li Zhangda did not accompany him back. Internal secretary Li Ganjun will go to Xiamen and Zhangzhou for inspection after meeting Jiang. (19th Central News Agency</p>
<p>Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xiamen) Jiang Guangnai gave a speech during the expanded memorial week for each division in Zhangzhou on the morning of the 19th, encouraging all armies not to abandon their anti-Japanese spirit because of the conclusion of the ceasefire agreement, and to continue fighting, to defeat imperialism and remove obstacles. Cai gave a speech, saying that we must unite and go with one direction, to defeat imperialism and traitors. Zhangzhou News: Jiang came to Xiamen and returned to the province, but the Xiamen ship opened on the 19th. Jiang did not go and stayed in Zhangzhou. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xiamen) Jiang Guangnai and Cai Tingkai went to Quanzhou together by car from Zhangzhou on the morning of the 20th and arrived at noon. Jiang returned to the province from Quanzhou via the Fuquan Highway, and Cai stayed in Quanzhou for one or two days before returning to Zhangzhou. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>ZHANG HUANXIANG ARRESTED AND ESCORTED TO CHANGCHUN</h3>
<p>(Beiping) People from the Northeast said that on June 14th, 80 Japanese soldiers went to the Dongbian area for inspection and rested at Meijitai, Xinbin County. 16 members of the righteous army special service team opened fire unexpectedly, killing 9 and wounding 7 Japanese soldiers. 2 members of the righteous army died. Zhang Huanxiang recently took his family to Fushun, his original home, and was arrested by the Japanese army. Only 4 or 5 people from the family of more than 20 escaped and were immediately escorted to Changchun. The Japanese and puppet states formed a special trial committee and scheduled a hearing. It is heard that Ding Chao is also among those being tried. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>TIBETAN TROOPS APPROACHING XIKANG</h3>
<p>Having Crossed the Jinsha River</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Kangding telegram: Since the signing of the Qinghai-Tibet peace agreement, the Tibetan army has completely withdrawn its troops stationed in Qinghai. Because Liu Wenhui is obsessed with internal wars and abandons border defense, he decided to divide into two routes to advance towards Kang, with the northern route starting from Qamdo, with Qiong Rang Dai Ben as the commander, and the southern route starting from Ningjingshan, with Zhen Dong Kalon as the commander. The combined strength is no less than 10,000 people. Kalon's troops have already completely crossed the east bank of the Jinsha River, with the aim of seizing Suan Dege. The front-line situation is extremely tense. Liu Wenhui, because he is busy dealing with Deng Xihou, only sent a telegram, ordering Deng Xiang, the commander of the Kangding garrison, to advance to Baan Dege for reinforcements. At the same time, he also recruited militiamen to fight. It is not clear whether they have been in contact in recent days. However, given the situation, it is only a matter of time before the fighting starts. The above situation has been reported to the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission of the General Staff Headquarters, requesting planning for coping strategies. Furthermore, whether it is possible for Liu Wenhui and Deng Xihou to draw troops into Kang for reinforcements in the midst of fierce internal wars, and whether they can afford the supply of foreign troops in terms of financial resources, are all doubtful. In addition, the Tibetan army is strong and there is no military restraint from Qinghai. The future is very worrying. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>SCARCITY OF GOODS IN JEHOL</h3>
<p>High Prices in Chengde</p>
<p>Residents Feel Quite Distressed</p>
<p>(Changchun) There is a lack of materials in Jehol. Although it was transported from Jinzhou by land after the end of the Jehol War, the transportation of goods from Beipiao relies entirely on camels, with a freight rate of ten yuan per hundred catties. Once it rains, traffic will be cut off, and it will be impossible to import goods. Therefore, prices in Chengde are expensive, and the general residents feel quite difficult. The Kwantung Army, trapped by the establishment of the Sino-Japanese ceasefire agreement, decided to use the Luan River to enter Jehol via Tianjin and Beiping. Luan River waterway is also not subject to traffic obstruction during the rainy season, and the freight is about four yuan per hundred catties. Therefore, Japanese goods are transported from Beiping by camels to Chengde via Miyun, and the lack of materials in Jehol can be seen to be alleviated. (20th Japanese Allied Telegraph)</p>
<h3>XIAMEN CUSTOMS CONFISCATES TAX-EVADING JAPANESE GOODS</h3>
<p>Japanese Taiwanese Attempt to Seize Goods Failed</p>
<p>(Xiamen) On the 19th, Xiamen Customs cracked down on more than 30 pieces of tax-evading goods on the Japanese ship Noseyama Maru and transported them to the Customs for confiscation. More than ten Japanese Taiwanese broke into the Customs to seize the goods, damaging the Russian Deputy Supervisor Ali Sandofu and Customs Police Zhu Qingjing. They abandoned the goods and fled on Shengping Road. The Customs is negotiating with the Japanese Consulate, and the Public Security Bureau is strictly pursuing them. There has been no success on the 20th. (20th</p>
<p>Dispatch)</p>
<h3>QINGHAI REPRESENTATIVES PETITION AGAINST TRANSFERRING TROOPS TO QINGHAI</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Qinghai representatives stationed in Beijing said that Sun Dianying's transfer to</p>
<p>Qinghai is only a rumor and has not been seen in government orders. However, observing the current situation in Qinghai, funding is extremely difficult. Qinghai Province only has seven counties, including Xining, Wenyuan, Lebu, Datong, Xunhua, and Guanhua, that produce Qing fruit, and the climate is cold, and wheat is not easy to ripen. To the inner Mongol regions, both Mongol and Tibetan ethnicities are nomadic, so the troops currently stationed in Qinghai Province have felt that it is difficult to supply them. If more troops are transferred, Qinghai Province may not be able to bear it. Liang Zhuer and the Qinghai representatives of various ethnicities stationed in Beijing went to the Executive Yuan on the 20th to petition the central government to consider the people of Qinghai and not to transfer troops to Qinghai to increase the people's suffering. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>CHEN JITANG CONVENES BANDIT SUPPRESSION CONFERENCE</h3>
<p>Chen Decides to Personally Supervise Bandit Suppression in Jiangxi</p>
<p>Xiang Hanping Goes to Hong Kong to Greet Huang</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chen Jitang convened a bandit suppression conference on the 20th to discuss the plan for suppressing the communist bandits in southern Jiangxi and the implementation period. The organization of the Southern Route Headquarters and the transportation and supply of ammunition were also discussed and methods were agreed upon. Meetings will continue on the 21st and 22nd. Chen Jitang decided to personally supervise the bandit suppression in Jiangxi. After the deployment of the various armies is completed, he will depart.

<h3>World Economic Conference's Hidden Reality</h3>
<p>The world's economic panic has deep roots and is extremely complex in content. In short, it can be summarized in two points: First, sharp political confrontation, such as the so-called reparations, war debts, division of colonial markets, and disputes over Eastern issues. Any one of these is enough to cause world unrest and affect the balance of the world economy. Second, conflicts of interest in the economy, such as credit panics, abandonment of the gold standard, currency inflation, and tariff wars. Crisis after crisis is enough to undermine the security of the world economy and have a significant impact on all countries. Even countries with skillful tactics and proper management may be able to maintain the status quo in figures, but in reality, the economic contradictions hidden within are no different from those of countries with obvious symptoms. For example, Japan and the United States, and France and Germany, may appear very different on the surface, but the content of their panic is the same. The inherent cause of panic brought about by capitalism lies in its internal contradictions. Therefore, low consumption capacity, overproduction, and small markets are all unavoidable facts. Suppose political issues such as war debts can be handled skillfully and temporarily compromised, and market disputes can be peacefully resolved through agreements, but if international credit panics cannot be restored and currencies remain unstable, how can this world be at peace? Therefore, restoring international credit and stabilizing currency ratios are the most urgent problems to be solved today, and also the first point of common concern for the World Economic Conference. However, based on factual observations, the United States has more than 4 billion US dollars in gold reserves, and it has no choice but to abandon the gold standard and adopt an inflationary monetary policy. The British colonial market spans the entire world, and it has no choice but to reduce currency parity to temporarily maintain its economic well-being. Japan, as a latecomer to capitalism, is following in Britain's footsteps, using inflationary policies to cover up the state of panic in its aggressive invasion of China. Thus, the main countries maintaining the gold standard are only France and Germany, as well as countries such as Belgium and the Netherlands, which rely on their vast colonies for adjustment. Among France and Germany, Germany, with its vitality not yet recovered, is still in a position to be guided economically, even though it has taken the lead politically. France wants to maintain the gold standard and has to form an opposing stance with countries led by the United Kingdom and the United States that have abandoned the gold standard. In this opposing situation, due to war debt relations, European countries are in favor of uniting to restrain the United States, while the United States benefits from separating European countries individually to facilitate the establishment of debt agreements. Therefore, the previous White House conference took the approach of individual talks instead of a round-table meeting. At the same time, the United Kingdom and the United States held their own views on exchange rates. Regarding the pound rate, the United Kingdom advocated 3.5 US dollars per pound, while the United States advocated 4 US dollars per pound. The result was a compromise of 3.75 US dollars to stabilize the exchange rate between the United Kingdom and the United States. In fact, how can market changes be directed by the agreements of politicians? Therefore, the compromise between the United Kingdom and the United States is also very unreliable. From this, it can be seen that it is not easy to seek stability in the world economy today.</p>
<p>Although the Four-Power Pact of Europe was signed before the World Economic Conference, its content has deviated from the original intention of the proposal. Germany's wishes for equality in its military strength and the abolition of the Treaty of Versailles have not been satisfied, and Italy's dissatisfaction has not been dispelled. Therefore, the elements of deterioration in European political relations still exist. As a result, the economic conference has experienced many twists and turns within a week of its opening. In addition to proposing revisions to the Treaty of Versailles, Germany also submitted a memorandum on the return of African colonies. This is difficult to achieve due to the insistence of countries such as the United Kingdom and France. However, a major hidden reef on the conference's future lies here. In addition, important Eastern issues related to the world have not yet been mentioned, and the complex economic relations in the East have not been fully discussed. Therefore, Japan's plan to propose a "motion to curb the anti-Japanese boycott movement" was also temporarily shelved. The main reason for this lies in expanding its so-called "military self-defense actions" and developing its aggressive policies. However, it can also be seen from this the situation within the conference.</p>
<p>Although countries have repeatedly proposed a truce in the bloodless tariff war, it has not been implemented. Recently, the actual difficulties of the United States after implementing currency inflation have increased. "Open and honest" is merely a diplomatic term. How can actual interests be easily sacrificed? Moreover, countries all attach importance to protectionist trade policies, such as industrial development subsidies and transportation subsidies. It is not easy to reach a common agreement to abolish them, so how can they lower their tariffs? This is not our intention to make pessimistic remarks and sensationalize. It is because we are facing a difficult time, and our countrymen must understand the situation and strive to improve in a timely manner.</p>
<h3>Japan's Project to Build the Rajin Port</h3>
<p>Nagoya to Tsuruga and the Opening of a Grand Canal</p>
<p>Since the opening of the Jikai Railway, the plan to build a large port at Rajin in Korea, and the transportation from Manchuria through Korea to northern Japan has become very close, the Nagoya Chamber of Commerce and Industry deeply feels the necessity of perfecting the connection between Tsuruga Port and central Japan. On the 19th, it held a meeting of the Transportation Department and decided on a plan to open a grand canal between Nagoya and Tsuruga. The specific method is to use Lake Biwa in Kyoto to build a grand canal, crossing central Japan, and connecting the Sea of Japan with the Pacific Ocean. Nagoya is 70 kilometers away from Lake Biwa, the lake is 29 kilometers long, and the distance from Lake Biwa to Tsuruga is 115 kilometers. If such a canal is established and navigates at a speed of five miles per hour, it will take less than fifteen hours to reach the other side. Its economic and other transportation value can be alarming. (Nijuunichi Nichiren Den)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Vice President of South Manchuria Railway convened the Board of Directors in Tokyo yesterday to finalize the matters to be submitted to the general meeting of shareholders on the 20th. After the meeting, the Vice President told reporters that due to the death of Supervisor Magoshi, a leading figure in the central financial community will be selected to succeed him. I came here with a draft plan for the construction of Rajin Port and will stay in Tokyo until the end of the month to negotiate with the Army and Colonial Affairs authorities in the hope of gaining their understanding. The current plan is a five-year continuous project of one million tsubo, costing 20 million yen. After completion, it will become a large pier that can handle 3 million tons of cargo.

<h3>Araki Controls Transportation</h3>
<p>Advocates Wartime Organization of Transportation Agencies</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The dictatorial officer of the Japanese military clique, Army Minister Araki, now wants to seize control of transportation under the military. Yesterday, he proposed a new organization for the Transportation Conference at a cabinet meeting. The Japanese Ministry of Railways originally had two organizations, the Railway Conference and the Civil Engineering Conference, which were dedicated to improving technology. The purpose of the Transportation Conference advocated by Araki is the wartime organization of transportation agencies and their control by the military. It is said that the Ministry of Railways is very dissatisfied with Araki's overreach. (Nijuunichi Karenden)</p>
<h3>Fierce Anglo-Japanese Trade War</h3>
<p>(London) British cotton merchants, with an increasingly firm attitude, are demanding that the government take repressive measures to restrain Japanese competition. George Mill, chairman of the Cotton Industry Federation, declared in his unusually sharp statement that Japan is now pursuing a firm policy of selling its cotton goods at any price, sometimes even below cost. If so, it can not only recover its old markets, but also seize new markets. Mill asserted, "This is the most obvious example of dumping, and no matter how much Lancashire's cotton industry improves its technology and organization, it cannot eliminate this threat. Therefore, our national policy must adopt retaliatory measures." (Jukuunichi Tatsu Den)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government, in response to the Indian authorities' official reply that they intend to conclude a new treaty, is now preparing to consider concrete measures. The Japanese representative is expected to depart around the beginning of August, and the meeting will be held at the end of August or the beginning of September. (Nijuunichi Nichiren Den)</p>
<p>Osaka, Osaka Sanpin, Tokyo Sugimori, Nagoya, each cotton yarn market has traditionally used 20-count yarn as the standard yarn. Recently, as a result of not buying Indian cotton, the amount of American cotton used will inevitably increase, and the tendency to import fine yarn will inevitably become significant. Therefore, Japanese textiles will undoubtedly increase the production of fine yarn. The current 20-count standard yarn will be meaningless, and there is a risk of speculative buying. The above exchanges have begun to study countermeasures or revise the standard yarn. (Nijuunichi Dentsu Den)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Since receiving the report from Consul General Tamura, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' feelings towards Britain have become more extreme. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs plans to protest to Britain by ordering Consul General Tamura, Ambassador Matsudaira to Britain, and Representative Ishii to protest to the Governor of Malaya, the British Foreign Office, and the London Economic Conference, respectively. The draft instruction is being prepared in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (Nijuunichi Karenden)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a report from Consul General Miyake stating that Miyake was ordered to raise three questions to the Indian government: whether India intends to continue the existing Japan-India Treaty of Commerce, and if it cannot continue, whether it intends to conclude a new treaty containing most-favored-nation clauses. If neither of these two principles can be accepted, whether the Indian government intends to conclude a provisional treaty of commerce and navigation. In response to this question, the Indian Minister of Commerce replied that the Indian government, considering the close economic relations between the two countries, is unwilling to treat Japan as a country without a treaty. In order to reorganize the commercial relations between the two countries, the Indian government hopes to begin negotiations. Regarding the three items proposed by the Japanese government, a reply will be made after internal discussion within the government. Before entering into negotiations, the Indian government wants to urge the Japanese government to reflect on the fact that the Japanese government has imposed prohibitive tariffs on Indian pig iron and rice since before. Therefore, the Indian government should not have any prejudice against this action. Foreign Minister Uchida decided to appoint Minister Sawada as plenipotentiary to send to India to begin negotiations after receiving the telegram. It is said that a formal decision will be made at today's National Assembly. (Nijuunichi Karenden)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today at 11:00 a.m., the Japan-India Association held an emergency board meeting at the Imperial Hotel. Chairman Okuma and others attended. As a result of discussions on Japan-India relations, because the issue is not only related to textiles, but also involves complex interests in various aspects, the association cannot immediately decide on countermeasures and will temporarily focus on self-reliance.

<h3>Japan Boycotts Chinese Yarn</h3>
<p>The Osaka Cotton Yarn and Cloth Alliance held a temporary meeting at the Cotton Industry Hall yesterday to discuss the results of the current situation with China and decided not to buy Indian cotton and to suspend the import of Chinese cotton yarn. (Nijuunichi Dentsu Den)</p>

<p>Responding to the World Economic Conference</p>
<p>Roosevelt Displays Skill</p>
<p>Eagerly Seeks the Development of Domestic Revitalization</p>
<p>Adopts a Negative Attitude Towards Stabilizing Currencies</p>
<p>France Has Felt Extreme Anxiety</p>
<p>Pittman Proposes a Gold Reserve Bill</p>
<p>Equivalent to a Response to European Demands</p>
<p>(Paris) The means of stabilizing the major currency systems of England, the United States, France, etc. during the London Conference are now showing a tendency to be deliberately delayed. Therefore, the French political authorities feel extremely anxious about this. President Roosevelt of the United States has revealed a very negative attitude towards the means of equalizing gold francs and gold pounds. Therefore, the French side feels as if cold water has been poured on their heads, and they are greatly chilled. (Jukuunichi Kokumin Den)</p>
<p>(Washington) Judging from various circumstances, the United States will adopt a negative attitude towards the World Economic Conference before President Roosevelt develops his domestic revitalization program. At the same time, the US delegation has been instructed that it must not take any action that binds itself without the President's consent. According to reliable sources, Senator Pittman's proposal that all countries uniformly use gold and silver as reserve funds, accounting for 25%, can be regarded as President Roosevelt's response to Europe's demand for currency stability. Pittman's proposal is fully in line with President Roosevelt's domestic and international policies. Therefore, people here regard this as an indication that the Economic Conference is now addressing fundamental issues. Professor Morley will not participate in the discussions at the conference when he arrives in London next week, but will be the liaison between President Roosevelt and the US delegation and will try to clarify the confusion caused by President Roosevelt's economic policies. (Nijuunichi Reuters Den)</p>
<p>(London) The French delegation criticized the United States for its purely artificial method of raising prices. French Finance Minister Bonnet said that the purpose of this conference is to raise world prices, but this matter can never be created artificially. The only sound method is to stabilize currencies and promote economic relations between countries. Several parties now believe that French Finance Minister Bonnet's words mean that the United States is hindering the stabilization movement to facilitate its producers. However, it is believed that once US manufacturers end their concerns about the new tax on agricultural products, the United States will likely change its attitude. As for the current situation, there is no sign of agreeing to either temporary or permanent stable exchange rates. (Nijuunichi Kokumin Den)</p>
<p>(Paris) Officials here are pessimistic about the current status of the World Economic Conference, believing that the situation has reached a dead end because President Roosevelt's attitude towards the issue of currency stability has failed to provide a way out. (Nijuunichi Reuters Den)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, the Petit Parisien issued a warning, saying that if the principle of currency stabilization cannot be accommodated in London, then the so-called Economic Conference will also reach a dead end. Although the conference can be arbitrarily extended for several weeks, if it cannot restore its original mission and first solve the issue of currency stabilization, it will ultimately fail.

<h3>Monetary Committee Meets</h3>
<p>Cure-Symptoms Subcommittee</p>
<p>Chamberlain Proposes...</p>
<p>Increase Wholesale Prices</p>
<p>(London) At this morning's meeting of the first subcommittee of the Monetary Committee, British Finance Minister Chamberlain put forward an important proposal containing suggestions to increase wholesale prices. Chamberlain believed that prices must be increased to a level that can restore the balance between costs and production, saying that the basic principle of this matter is the cessation of monetary tightening and the abundance of low-interest loans. If speculation is promoted, the central banks of major countries should cooperate and announce their intention to actively adopt a policy of low-interest and ample loans through open market operations. (Nijuunichi Reuters Den)</p>
<p>Cure-Root Subcommittee</p>
<p>Discusses Pittman's Silver Proposal</p>
<p>Yan Dai Expresses Sincere Support</p>
<p>Another Subcommittee Formed for Review</p>
<p>(London) This morning's meeting of the second subcommittee of the Monetary Committee discussed the gold standard related to the Pittman proposal of the US representative. The Uruguayan representative stated that if gold is insufficient, silver may be used as the standard. He believed that a 25% gold reserve to offset silver is psychologically dangerous. The Belgian representative Yesba agreed with the US proposal to reduce the percentage of gold reserves, but expressed reservations about the silver issue. Chairman Oul, representative of the Committee Jiang Boke, suggested that a consensus could be reached on two points: one is currency stability, and the other is the restoration of the gold standard. The French representative agreed with the chairman's words, and the Italian representative agreed with the gold portion of the Pittman proposal. The British representative, Hailshan, said that Pittman's proposal on gold coincided with the British opinion. The Chinese representative, Yan Huiqing, expressed great sympathy for Pittman's gold proposal, saying that China is a silver-using country and has important commercial relations with gold-using countries. He supported the formation of a subcommittee to study the US representative's silver proposal, but he reserved his opinion to be expressed later in the subcommittee. Pittman's silver proposal was submitted to the subcommittee for review. Representatives from England, Italy, Mexico, Canada, India, China, and Japan joined the subcommittee, with Pittman as the chairman. (Nijuunichi Reuters Den)</p>
<p>(London) The second subcommittee of the Monetary Committee is scheduled to meet at 11:00 this morning to make a summary discussion of the proposal submitted by the US representative to the Economic Conference. Yesterday, the representatives of Switzerland and the Netherlands strongly advocated the proper use of the gold standard. The Swiss representative believed that the gold standard could only be properly used if all countries agreed not to issue banknotes beyond the amount necessary for domestic and foreign trade. The Dutch representative believed that gold should only be used for the circulation between central banks of various countries. This morning, the motion on the gold standard submitted by the first subcommittee will also be discussed. (Jukuunichi Reuters Den)</p>
<p>(London) At the meeting of the Monetary and Financial Committee on the 19th, the Romanian representative, Magaru, said that unless the currency price is restored to the price of 1929, all financial and economic efforts will be ineffective, and suggested organizing a special subcommittee to consider this issue. British Finance Minister Chamberlain proposed to draft a resolution on price and credit policies, and then submit it to the next meeting for discussion. However, representatives from European countries advocated that the resolution should be drafted after the work of each subcommittee is completed.</p>
<p>French Finance Minister Bonnet also considered it necessary to increase the currency price, but had reservations about restoring it to the price of 1929. He said that the reason for the current decline in currency prices is actually due to excessive savings. The best way to stabilize the currency is to circulate the saved capital and allow the capital to flow freely. The committee finally decided, according to the proposal of the Belgian representative, to use the report of the expert committee as the basis for the committee's future discussions, and asked each delegation to submit their draft resolutions to the meeting for discussion.

<h3>Economic Conference Establishes Subcommittee</h3>
<p>Composed of Representatives from Seventeen Countries</p>
<p>Considers Issues of Commercial Policy</p>
<p>International Trade Management Proposal</p>
<p>England Indicates Conditional Acceptance</p>
<p>(London) This morning, the Economic Committee of the World Economic Conference decided to organize a subcommittee to consider issues of commercial policy. This subcommittee will be composed of seventeen representatives from ten European countries, as well as the United States, Japan, and South Africa. (Nijuunichi Reuters Den)</p>
<p>(London) This morning, Jiang Guo made a proposal for international management of production and sales at the Economic and Trade Committee of the World Economic Conference. The British Minister of Commerce, Ren Ximan, gave it a conditional acceptance. Ren said that the United Kingdom is prepared to study various issues, not only as tariff barrier issues but also as supply and demand issues. The United Kingdom advocates the method of most-favored-nation clauses, but is unwilling to sacrifice bilateral agreements by strictly adhering to this method. As for the management of raw material production, judging from what has already been done, it has a good sign of increasing prices. If the coordination and cooperation plan can be supported by most producers and provides adequate protection for the interests of consumers, the United Kingdom is willing to consider it.

<p>(London) China's Bei Zuyi will replace Yan Huiqing to attend the first subcommittee of the Monetary Committee, and Luo Tingyu will replace Yan to attend the second subcommittee. According to Bei and Luo, they are financial experts of the Chinese delegation. (Nijuunichi Reuters Den)</p>
<h3>Two Subcommittees of the Monetary Committee</h3>
<p>Separate Management of Cure-Symptoms and Cure-Root Plans</p>
<p>Issue of Raising World Prices</p>
<p>Representatives from Various Countries Express Their Opinions</p>
<p>(London) The first and second subcommittees of the Monetary Committee also met this afternoon. The first subcommittee dealt with cure-symptoms measures, while the second subcommittee dealt with cure-root plans. The first subcommittee met at 4:10 p.m. Chairman Ren Ge put forward the memorandum submitted to the Monetary Committee by the Romanian representative this morning, as well as the Hungarian proposal for measures to be taken before the elimination of exchange restrictions. At the same time, the Swiss representative also submitted a memorandum on the work of the Monetary Committee, advocating that the subcommittee dealing with monetary standard issues should immediately prepare a report. Switzerland believed that the monetary standard is gold. The work of this subcommittee should not be over-centralized. The so-called gold standard is pure gold, which is different from dominant currencies or those based on gold and silver. British Finance Minister Chamberlain asked whether the gold standard issue should belong to the first subcommittee dealing with cure-symptoms measures or the second subcommittee dealing with cure-root plans. After some discussion, it was decided to submit the matter to the second subcommittee and ask it to handle it immediately. Chairman Ren Ge then proceeded according to the agenda. The first item on the agenda was credit policy, the most urgent plan in financial restructuring. Ren Ge asked representatives to send letters, but no one responded. The chairman then announced the second item on the agenda, which was the issue of prices. The Iraqi representative spoke first, pointing out the reasons why prices could not be reduced any further. The Swedish representative said that countries are free to increase prices according to their needs. This subcommittee should clearly state that there should be no more contraction. The chairman asked the Swedish representative whether there were any practical measures to increase prices. The Swedish representative, Kaiser, answered by citing British Finance Minister Chamberlain's opening speech, saying that efforts must be made to restore world prices to ensure that producers obtain sufficient economic returns and restore the balance between production costs and prices.</p>
<p>Kaiser also said that if this subcommittee only made this statement, it would be a great step forward. (Jukuunichi Reuters Den)</p>
<h3>Nationalism Is Rampant</h3>
<p>Unwilling to Participate in Cure-Root Work</p>
<p>Coulson Sighs and Speaks Out</p>
<p>(London) US Senator Coulson said today that, unfortunately, countries, including the United States, are still reluctant to let go of nationalism and are confident that they can steer their own isolated boats regardless of the success or failure of the World Economic Conference. Coulson is the only Republican representative in the US delegation attending the World Economic Conference. Yesterday, he was asked to choose to join the work of the cure-symptoms or cure-root subcommittee. Coulson was willing to participate in the cure-symptoms subcommittee, saying that he was afraid that his life would not be long enough to see the results of the cure-root subcommittee.

<h3>Pittman's Proposal</h3>
<p>Reduce the Legal Gold Reserve, Use Gold and Silver Together</p>
<p>Limit the World's Silver Supply, Raise Silver Prices</p>
<p>(London) This afternoon, at the meeting of the subcommittee considering permanent plans of the Monetary Committee, the US representative, Pittman, put forward a resolution proposing to severely reset gold prices. Pittman, chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has always been a strong supporter of silver. This proposal advocates: 1) Countries agree to adopt gold as the basis for international exchange rates and currency reserves; 2) Central banks of various countries agree to stipulate that the legal minimum limit of currency reserves is 25%. According to the current legal minimum level in various countries, it is actually about 40%; 3) Silver is still the medium of exchange for a large part of the world's population, and at this time it is necessary to restore confidence in the East. Silver-producing countries and countries storing large amounts of silver should negotiate and agree to limit the supply of silver, widely mint silver coins, increase the silver content in silver coins to 800 parts per thousand, and ask central banks to use silver in currency reserves up to 20% of the total amount. Pittman solemnly declared that he was formally submitting this resolution on behalf of the US delegation, and proposed that governments of various countries agree to stop destroying silver coins or reducing the silver content, and persuade countries to use silver coins instead of paper subsidiary coins. Finally, he solemnly explained the difference between adopting gold as the standard for international exchange rate calculation and restoring the gold standard by each country, so as to avoid other countries from having the impression that the United States is planning to restore the gold standard, and said that adopting a 25% gold reserve does not necessarily require restoring the gold standard. According to Pittman's plan, there was a proposal to limit the supply of silver, but because it was only used as a basis for discussion, detailed restrictions were not proposed. (Jukuunichi Kokumin Den)</p>
<h3>Reduction of Gold Reserves</h3>
<p>Japan Considers it Advantageous</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The proposal put forward by the United States at the World Economic Conference, advocating that the gold reserves of central banks of all countries be uniformly reduced to 25 percent, is endorsed by both political and business circles in Japan. Political circles say that the gold reserves maintained by the great powers today are indeed too high. Fifty-five percent of the world's gold is now owned by the United States and France, causing other countries to feel the pain of gold shortages. Therefore, Japan has no objection to the reduction of gold reserves through cooperation between governments and central banks, but this matter still requires careful study to determine whether reducing it to 25 percent is sufficient. Business circles believe that the US proposal is feasible and regard it as a precursor to the restoration of the gold standard in various countries. (20th Reuters)</p>

<p>(Washington) Regarding the issue of currency stabilization, although there are various rumors of compromise, people here remain pessimistic about the effectiveness of the economic conference. It is generally believed that the United States has now abandoned the policy of broad international cooperation and is inclined to establish bilateral agreements. (19th Havas)</p>
<h3>Deputy Secretary of State Embarks for England</h3>
<p>Related to Currency Negotiations</p>
<p>(Washington) Professor Moley, President Roosevelt's most trusted advisor, departed today for New York and will take the Manhattan mail ship to London tomorrow. His trip to England is related to negotiations on the temporary stabilization of currency at the Economic Conference. (20th Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) Today, London is also feeling doubtful about the attitude of the United States toward stabilizing currency values. Some representatives have openly predicted that nothing can be done to prevent currency fluctuations until Moley, the Economic Advisor to the US President, arrives here. Some even believe that the US delegation is deliberately hindering the progress of the conference so that the domestic inflationary movement can fully demonstrate its effectiveness in raising prices. News has just been received here that US Deputy Secretary of State Moley has been ordered to come to London to report on the latest impressions and reactions of the United States at home to the conference. French representatives, who had attacked American theories, believe that Moley's arrival must carry new instructions from the US President, and imply that Moley must have instructions to reconcile the dispute between Secretary of State Hull and Senator Pittman over tariff proposals.

<h3>Acting Secretary of Treasury Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Currency Unrelated to Success or Failure of Conference</p>
<p>(Washington) Acting Secretary of the Treasury, Acheson, stated that the US government believes that the issue of currency stabilization is only one of many issues in the economic conference, so this issue cannot be considered the key to the success or failure of the conference. The US government has no special position on the entire issue of currency stabilization, but believes that temporary currency stabilization is of no great benefit, and the US government has no intention of interfering in the gold and dollar market, and will only allow the currency to rise and fall on its own. (19th Reuters)</p>
<h3>Opposing Temporary Currency Stabilization</h3>
<p>Aimed at Implementing Inflation</p>
<p>(London) French representatives said that before the opening of this conference, they heard that all countries wanted to stabilize currency values as soon as possible, because currency fluctuations were greatly hindering commerce. However, the US representatives alone opposed temporary stabilization and put forward a permanent stabilization plan, but it contained no concrete proposals. At this time, the exchange rate between the US dollar and the British pound fell sharply. The prices of goods and securities in the country rose sharply as a result of temporary currency inflation. Here, many hope that this sharp fall in the US dollar can show some indication of the dollar-pound exchange rate desired by the Americans. However, on the US side, in addition to the Treasury Department's statement that it will allow the dollar to find its own level, there is no other news reaching England. (20th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to news from London, a compromise could be reached on the issue of currency stability within a week. The US Treasury Department denied this news, saying that after the plan proposed by European countries last week was rejected by Roosevelt, the US delegation in London did not send any new proposals back to the US Treasury Department. It also said that the US government is currently avoiding the issue of currency stabilization because the authorities believe that there are still various urgent issues, such as improving the currency situation, balancing the budget, tariffs, and disarmament, that urgently need to be resolved. Seeking currency stabilization before these issues are resolved is like trying to achieve success too quickly. The Treasury Department also said that the final decision-maker is Roosevelt, not the US delegation in London. At present, the US dollar is affected by various artificial facts, and its true price cannot be seen in the exchange rate. The so-called artificial facts are the establishment of currency stabilization funds by foreign governments. As long as this behavior does not stop, the true price of the US dollar will not be expressed. (19th Havas)</p>
<h3>United States Absorbs Silver</h3>
<p>Gold Exports Restricted</p>
<p>(Washington) After the price of silver for future delivery rose in the United States last month, it absorbed a large amount of silver from abroad, resulting in the highest volume of silver imports in that month in four years. A considerable portion of it was shipped from China, and the profits of those engaged in trading were also considerable. In May, silver imports totaled US$5,275,000, while exports were only US$235,000. Conversely, gold shipments were at their lowest level. The total import amount in May was only US$1,785,000, a decrease of more than one-quarter compared to the US$6,769,000 imported in April when the United States was collecting gold. (19th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Domestic Prices Rise Accordingly</h3>
<p>Speculative Frenzy in New York Market</p>
<p>(Washington) At present, the prices of all goods and securities are rising due to the softening of the dollar, and the price of silver has also risen by one cent per ounce. However, this is rising with general prices and not because it is expected to be widely used for coinage. (19th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt's rejection of the currency stabilization proposal is widely regarded as Roosevelt's intention to inflate the currency, leading to a speculative frenzy in the stock exchange today. The prices of various stocks rose by two to seven pounds, and the volume of transactions was six million shares. The pound rose by seven pounds to four dollars and fourteen cents, and the prices of wheat, corn, and cotton all rose sharply. (19th Reuters)</p>
<h3>Japan Decides on Policy Towards Tariff Truce</h3>
<p>Preparing to Adopt a Challenging Posture Towards England</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The privy council's consultation on Japan's participation in the tariff truce has been decided by the cabinet. Foreign Minister Uchida met with the Emperor at 3:00 PM to report the details. However, it is said that the privy council has considerable objections to this tariff truce. The number of countries participating in the tariff truce has reached more than 40. However, major countries such as Britain and France, for their own selfish purposes, attach infinitely broad reservations to arbitrarily raise their own tariffs in the future. Therefore, this case is almost equivalent to a piece of waste paper. If Japan, a country that implements low-tariff rates, participates in this case and is bound by the right of tariff self-defense, it should be absolutely avoided. This opinion of the privy council is quite powerful now. (20th Japan League Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The British Empire, in order to recover its commercial decline, is working hard to construct economic protectionism and has begun an undisguised challenge to Japan. From the abandonment of the Indo-Japanese Trade Treaty to the increase in cotton cloth tariffs, the suspension of most-favored-nation treatment in Africa, and the increase in tariffs in the Malay Federation, it is forcibly implementing measures to exclude Japanese goods. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that the situation is very serious and has first taken emergency measures to instruct Consul-General Tamura in Singapore to protest to the Malay Federation government. At the same time, Ambassador Matsudaira stationed in England was ordered to warn the British government, and it was internally decided to instruct Plenipotentiary Ishii to submit a notice of condemnation of Britain's untrustworthy behavior to the Economic Conference. The drafting of this notice and instruction is now underway. (20th Den-tsu Telegram)</p>

<h3>Japan and the United States Collude Outside the Conference</h3>
<p>Secret Negotiations on Arbitration Treaty</p>
<p>Russian Representative Pays Unusual Attention</p>
<p>Chinese Envoy Remains Indifferent</p>
<p>(London) Japan and the United States are secretly negotiating outside the Economic Conference to conclude an arbitration treaty. Japan's intention is to obtain two guarantees: first, to prevent a Sino-Russian alliance; second, to prevent China and India from excluding most Japanese products. The United States intends to maintain a balance between China and Japan to withdraw its fleet stationed in the Pacific without danger. (19th Havas)</p>

<h3>Sale of Chinese Eastern Railway</h3>
<p>Problems Arise Before Negotiations Begin</p>
<p>(Harbin) Negotiations between Russia and Manchuria on the sale of the North Manchuria Railway are scheduled to be held in Tokyo on the 25th. Because the deadline is approaching, the relationship between Manchuria and Russia in Harbin is very delicate. The Soviet Russian side wants to first lift the blockade of the two countries' borders and then conduct negotiations. However, "Manchukuo" believes that the blockade issue is related to the return of locomotives and freight cars, so if the Soviet Russian side does not express its intention to return the vehicles, it will never lift the blockade.

<p>[P Soviet Russian Naval Defense Force Kills Japanese Fishermen&gt;</p>
<p>Japan Protests Seriously to Russia</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 19th: According to the official report released by the Ministry of the Navy, in the case of the Soviet Russian coastal defense team killing three Japanese fishermen on the eastern coast of Kamchatka at Cape Olyutorka on the 14th of this month, the Japanese authorities have lodged a serious protest to Soviet Russia and will conduct negotiations. According to the report, the Japanese fishing boat Fukumi Maru (transliteration) was fishing outside Kamchatka in accordance with the Russo-Japanese Fisheries Agreement, and on the 14th of this month, it encountered a wind and was forced to take refuge near Cape Olyutorka due to engine trouble. At 3:00 PM that afternoon, three Japanese fishermen were preparing to go ashore by small boat to find fresh drinks when they were suddenly fired upon by Russians. It was done by the Russian naval defense force. At the same time, the Fukumi Maru was also fired upon, and the hull was hit in several places. However, it eventually sailed to a location outside the line of fire, but was unable to rescue the fishermen in the small boat. After receiving the news, a Japanese destroyer sailed to the scene and later found the remains of the three men and the small boat about one mile northeast of Cape Olyutorka.

<p>Reuters, Vienna, 20th – After returning to Vienna from London, Austrian Premier Dollfuss swiftly and severely suppressed the National Socialist Party organizations within Austria. Yesterday, he issued an order banning all activities of the National Socialist Party.

The dissolution was carried out suddenly today. It is reported that the headquarters of the Free Thinkers Association in Vienna will also be dissolved within days. Today, auxiliary police returning from training in Krems were attacked with two hand grenades, seriously injuring twelve people and slightly injuring eight. The grenade throwers escaped into the forest and could not be apprehended.</p>
<p>National Society, Vienna, 20th – The General Police Directorate here announced that a major criminal has been arrested today in Krems in connection with the bombing case. The person, who identified himself as Moser, 21 years old, confessed to the crime and stated that he was assisted by a member of the advance team of the National Socialist Party. Moser is the leader of the National Socialist Party assault troops in Krems and was injured in the cheek by shrapnel from the bomb. Early this morning, another bomb exploded under a railway bridge near Vienna, destroying the wooden bridge and damaging the tracks. Army pilots rushed to the scene, and the bridge is now being rebuilt to prevent traffic disruptions. The Austrian National Socialist Party's newspapers are currently banned from publication by the authorities, and it is expected that all of the party's periodicals throughout the country will be banned as well. Since last night, national defense soldiers and police throughout Austria have been on high alert.</p>
<p>Reuters, Vienna, 19th – Austrian Justice Minister Dr. Schiniig announced today that the Cabinet has resolved to prohibit all activities of the National Socialist Party throughout the country. The government has strived to avoid taking extreme measures to prevent bloodshed, but in light of recent events, it is necessary to take strong actions to maintain law and order. The police's thorough investigation of the bombing cases and other violent incidents that have occurred recently in Vienna has revealed that the suspicions against the Austrian National Socialist Party were indeed justified. According to the news released this evening, all of the bombing cases were planned and directed by a group of National Socialist Party members belonging to the assault troops. Among the National Socialist Party members arrested today are twenty assault troop members who are directly or indirectly related to the cases. Their names have not been disclosed, but it is said that there are several important figures among them. All of the organizations of Hitler's assault troops in Austria are now expected to be dissolved. Today, the police authorities announced that a detailed report will be released as soon as the investigation is completed.</p>
<p>Havas, London, 19th – At a meeting of the House of Commons, a member raised questions about the situation in Germany and Austria. Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Eden replied that Austrian Premier Dollfuss is working hard on financial recovery and safeguarding Austria's independence. The British government is viewing Dollfuss' efforts with sympathy and hopes that the causes of discord between Germany and Austria can be reduced soon.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 19th – Recently, a responsible representative of Premier Hitler stated firmly that the National Socialist Party adheres to a policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of places outside of Germany. Today, the "National Socialist Party Communication" newspaper explained that the German National Socialist Party recognizes the Austrian National Socialist Party as its "foreign branch," so the above-mentioned policy of non-interference does not apply to the Austrian National Socialist Party.</p>
<p>Reuters, Budapest, 19th – Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös returned here from Berlin today. According to his statement to visitors in Vienna, his purpose in going to Berlin was to discuss the export business between Hungary and Germany. He also stated that the relations between Hungary and Austria remain very good.</p>
<p>Havas, Vienna, 19th – Hungarian General Gömbös's visit to Germany has created a rather negative impression here. Well-informed sources stated that all European countries' diplomacy is supporting Austria in the dispute between Germany and Austria, so Austria has consistently rejected mediation of the dispute. This time, Gömbös was not invited to mediate. Havas, Budapest, 20th – Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös recently gave a speech at the National Agricultural Association, explaining that the purpose of his trip was economic issues. He also said that political</p>
<p>issues were also mentioned. He also acknowledged that France and Austria have entered into an agreement to facilitate the repayment of debts.</p>
<h3>United States Building Warships on a Large Scale</h3>
<p>National Society, Washington, 19th – U.S. Navy Secretary Swanson stated today that out of the thirty-two newly built warships, seventeen will be contracted to private shipyards. The drawings have been handed over to the companies, and the deadline for bidding is July 26th. Among them are two aircraft carriers, one light cruiser, one heavy cruiser,</p>
<p>eleven destroyers, and two submarines. The rest will be manufactured in naval shipyards, with a portion of the work allocated to naval personnel on a daily basis. It seems that the Geneva Disarmament Conference wants to limit the army, and the London Treaty can be allowed to remain in effect until its expiration. Therefore, it is expected that there will be no risk of cancellation of this shipbuilding contract.</p>

<h3>Song Zheyuan Will Return to Chahar</h3>
<p>Feng Yuxiang to Serve as Reclamation Director, Sun Dianying's Troops Preparing to Open Qinghai, Shang Zhen Also to Obey Orders to Govern Northern Henan, Special Dispatch from Peiping: A peaceful resolution to the Chahar affairs has been largely agreed upon. The order for Song Zheyuan to return to his post was issued by the Executive Yuan's Peiping Political Affairs Reorganization Committee last night and sent to Song's office. The original order is as follows: "It is hereby ordered that Song Zheyuan, Chairman of Chahar Province, who previously had his duties temporarily assumed by the Director of the Civil Affairs Department, Wu Yong, due to commanding military affairs, should return to his post immediately, as the political affairs of Chahar Province are now of great importance. There is no need for Wu Yong to act on his behalf. Report the date of your return immediately. This order." At the same time, the Peiping branch of the Military Affairs Commission also ordered Song to lead his troops back to Chahar to reorganize the military and political affairs of Chahar Province. After receiving the order, Song prepared to send representatives to Chahar to meet with Feng, to discuss everything. Meanwhile, in Peiping, he discussed with He Yingqin, Huang Fu, and other parties the methods for reorganizing the military and political affairs of Chahar Province. After the representatives to Chahar return to Peiping and all matters have been discussed and settled, he will lead his troops to Chahar to return to his post. Song's troops are currently stationed in the Shuangqiao, Dongba, and Guanyintang areas. Another unit has already been sent to Yangquan, Shanxi, to resume its original defense. It is currently uncertain whether the troops stationed in Shuangqiao and other places will be sent to Chahar. The designation of Feng as the Reclamation Director has been decided, and after Feng's consent is obtained, it can be announced. He and Huang have appointed representatives who will travel to Chahar with Song's representatives within days to meet with Feng to discuss. The order for Sun Dianying to be the Reclamation Director of Qinghai will be announced at the same time as Feng's designation. Sun is also preparing to set out, but the location of his station and the route of his departure are still being discussed with all parties. The designation of Fang Zhenwu and the reorganization and defense of his troops are extremely difficult to work out, as Fang has stated that he is resisting Japan and absolutely unwilling to leave Chahar Province in the short term. As for the reorganization of Deng Wen's volunteer army, it can be started after Su and Ma come north, and there are no major problems. The reorganization of the Chahar Provincial Government is currently under negotiation. As for Pang Bingxun, the central government and the North China authorities will give him some kind of title to provide for his settlement. Shang Zhen has been designated to govern Henan, leading his troops, the three divisions of Gao Hongwen, Huang Guanghua, and Li Xingcun, and the two divisions of Gao Guizi and Liu Duoquan, into Henan. Liu's troops are reorganized from Zhang Xueliang's guards, and their weapons and uniforms are unusually complete. Liu has a very deep relationship with Shang as Shang's adopted son. The Northeast armies have retreated and gathered in Peiping and Tianjin. The number of people is large, and opinions are extremely complex. Future settlement is quite difficult, and the authorities are studying this. Han Fuju's position in the north is extremely important. This time he came to Peiping, he made many suggestions for the military and political affairs of North China. The authorities are very receptive to his proposals. This morning (18th) at 9:00 AM, Shang Zhen, Jiang Bocheng, and others visited Han's office on Rongxian Hutong to discuss matters with Han. At around 10:00 AM, Huang Fu also visited Han with his secretary-general, He Qigong, to discuss everything. Han originally planned to return to Jinan after the establishment of the Political Affairs Reorganization Committee, but because there are still matters to be discussed in Peiping, he will probably have to stay for another two or three days before he can return quickly. (June 18th)</p>
<h3>Yuan Liang's Policy Guidelines</h3>
<p>Municipal Construction Roughly Divided into Seven Points</p>
<p>Special dispatch from Peiping: Recently, as the Japanese army gradually withdrew from Peiping, the city's economy has recovered. In Tianjin, the Japanese concession is making every effort to plan for prosperity. Most of the plainclothes troops from the previous riot have been transported from Tianjin to Dalian and returned to various places in Northeast China. The tense situation has become a thing of the past. Most of the sandbags and other defensive works piled up in various parts of Peiping have also been removed. Only the areas inside and outside Qianmen, such as Xijiaominxiang and the entrances of various hutongs in Zhubaoshi, are still guarded with earthen bags several feet high. This is because the banks and shops must be cautious to prevent banditry. The curfew time has been extended from 11:00 PM to 12:00 AM. Various theaters are preparing to reorganize and perform night shows. The rumor that the curfew will start at 1:00 AM has not yet been implemented. After 12:00 AM, the west entrance of Dongjiaominxiang inside Qianmen is still jointly guarded by military police, police, and security teams to check pedestrians, but it is not as strict as before.</p>
<p>On the day when Zhang Xueliang gracefully left Peiping, He Yingqin came to Peiping on Jiang's orders to sit in town and preside over the affairs of the Military Affairs Commission branch. All of the old personnel during Zhang's time in Peiping followed Xiao Gui Cao Sui's meaning and were mostly not changed. Mayor Zhou Dawen repeatedly requested to resign due to illness, and the central government repeatedly retained him, but his initial wish was not fulfilled. Recently, his desire to resign became stronger and his request to leave became more urgent. Finally, the National Government approved Yuan Liang's appointment as the mayor of Peiping on the 16th. Yuan originally served as a counselor of the Peiping Political Affairs Committee. There was a previous rumor that he would succeed Bao Yulin as the Director of the Public Security Bureau, but it was not successful. In order to inquire about Yuan's future policy guidelines, the reporter went to Yuan's residence in Xitangzi Hutong this morning (18th) and presented a name card to request an interview. He was received and made the following remarks: (Reporter asked) Mr. Yuan, you are now succeeding Mayor Zhou to preside over the municipal administration of Peiping. When will you take office? (Yuan replied) I received an order from the National Government in Peiping and was wrongly entrusted with a heavy responsibility. I feel very apprehensive. Because of the limited time, I cannot rush to complete the preparations in time. I plan to go to the Municipal Government on the 21st to take charge of everything, so that someone is responsible for all affairs. As for the issue of taking office, it is just a formality and will be postponed slightly to complete the oath-taking ceremony. (Asked) After you take office, will there be any changes to the heads of the various bureaus of the Municipal Government? It is said that you will choose to concurrently serve as the Director of the Public Security Bureau or the Director of the Finance Bureau. Is that reliable? (Answered) I have never advocated concurrent positions. I am still worried that my energy will be insufficient to handle one thing by one person, let alone concurrently handle several things by one person. There were a total of six counselors in the former State Council, and I was one of them. They all had concurrent positions at that time, but I was the only one who did not. Now, as long as everyone can work together, I will never change them casually with my own ideas. The saying that I will concurrently serve as the Director of the Public Security Bureau or the Director of the Finance Bureau is even more unfounded. (Asked) Since you have been appointed, you must have good plans. The citizens have high expectations for you. Will there be any considerable plans for the municipal administration in the future? Can we hear about your policy guidelines? (Answered) The national affairs have reached such a state, and the urgent task at present should be to strive for national governance. It is urgent. If the people of the country do not make efforts to rejuvenate, I dare to say that in a few years, our magnificent Republic of China will fall behind the puppet state. Isn't that shameful? I firmly believe that I can achieve the four words of integrity and effort to seek municipal improvement. However, governance does not lie in many words. I do not want to issue empty theories. I must do it and show it to the citizens to be useful. (Asked) What are your construction guidelines? Please tell us briefly. (Answered) My planned plan has about seven points: (1) Stabilize the lives of citizens (2) Make finances open and never increase donations arbitrarily.</p>
<h3>Gan Province Discovers Ancient Inkstone from the Song Dynasty</h3>
<p>Emperor Shenzong of Song bestowed it upon Mi Fu as an imperial treasure.</p>
<p>The material is star gold gemstone, engraved with Mi's handwriting. The inkstone is rectangular, no more than a few inches in length, and weighs over twenty catties. Nanchang Correspondence: Recently, an ancient inkstone from the Song Dynasty has been discovered in this city, owned by Mr. Ding Yiwen of Dongxiang. It is about six inches long, three inches wide, and weighs over twenty catties. It is engraved with "Imperial Gift Treasure," surrounded by four dragons coiling and protecting it, lifelike. Below is engraved an inkstone preface by Mi Fu, the characters are extremely fine and neat, but due to its age, it is slightly blurred. The antique flavor makes people reluctant to let go. According to the owner speaking to the reporter, this inkstone was unearthed by Jingzhen kiln workers when digging mud and was purchased by Ding at a high price. According to archaeologists, the inkstone is from the era of Emperor Shenzong of Song, made of foreign star gold gemstone, hence it is so heavy. When a foreign country contributed this gemstone, the courtiers congratulated it. Shenzong, considering Mi Nangong as a contemporary calligrapher and painter and fond of ancient inkstones, specifically bestowed it. Therefore, in the center of the four dragons' protection, the four characters of Imperial Gift Treasure are engraved. Mi regarded this inkstone as a treasure of the world and, as it was given by the emperor, he personally carved a preface to commemorate and never forget it. According to Mi, he was a native of Xiangyang, Song Dynasty, with the courtesy name Yuanzhang, nickname Lumu Jushi, skilled in calligraphy and painting, and good at painting landscapes and figures. He was a famous artist of the Song Dynasty, serving as an assistant minister of the Ministry of Rites, Zhi Huaiyang Army. The Imperial Gift Treasure Inkstone was probably at the time of his official duty. (June 18th)</p>
<p>Tax increases will burden merchants and the people. The municipal budget must be balanced in revenue and expenditure. Even one penny should be made clear to the citizens. When I served in the Jiangxi Provincial Government, I tried my best to eliminate corruption and achieved considerable results. (3) Never employ private individuals. I am confident that I can break through favoritism. In the future, all facilities will be based on talent. (4) Pay attention to primary school education as the fundamental work of national rejuvenation. (5) To prosper Peiping, we should first encourage handicrafts (6) Improve extravagant customs. I am willing to set an example by being frugal in clothing, food, housing, and transportation. (7) The construction of roads and other projects should continue to be done. I hope that all sectors of society and the press will give guidance at any time. (June 18th)</p>
<h3>Suzhou Soil Smugglers Arrested for Transporting Opium</h3>
<p>It was discovered that a person established a soil smuggling organization inside No. 126 West Meixiang, which had a wide distribution network. Because the storage was secret, the case had never been solved. Recently, the Narcotics Investigation Office learned that the organization sent personnel to Wuhan to smuggle a large batch of opium, which could arrive in Suzhou on the night of the 19th. Therefore, Director Han personally led many investigators to wait at the station. (When the Nanjing train arrived, several soil smugglers, including Chen Qing, Zhang Cun, Chen Gang, and He Xiang, were apprehended and over seven hundred taels of Sichuan opium were seized on the spot.) They were immediately taken to the station for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Songjiang Huayang Bridge Murder Case</h3>
<p>Huayang Bridge, in the eastern suburbs of this city, is three or four li away from the city. There are over two hundred households of shops and residents. There were originally police and security guards from the police station. However, last night (19th) at 8:30 PM, during heavy rain and few pedestrians, a robbery and murder occurred at the Xi Yongda Rice Shop. The shop owner, Xi Weiquan, and his wife were shot and killed by bandits. After the murderers fled, family members awakened the neighbors and reported the case. The city's water and land public security agencies immediately dispatched special service teams and detective teams, mobilizing all personnel and borrowing cars to rush to Huayang Bridge to pursue the traces of the bandits. They have since disappeared. They returned this morning. After investigation, it was learned that there were three bandits, all with Pudong accents. One person was outside acting as a lookout, while two people pretended to be from a sailing boat and asked the old man if he was loading rice. At the time, the shop owner had already gone upstairs to sleep. The wife, Tu, and her granddaughter were downstairs and answered that they were not loading. The two bandits closed the front door and showed their box guns. The wife was horrified and went upstairs. The bandits followed. The granddaughter was alone in a room and dared not speak. Then, gunshots were heard like a string of pearls. When the bandits left, she saw Xi Weiquan bare-chested and wearing short shirt, shot in the head, and died on the edge of the bed. Tu was lying on the doorstep, and the lid of the leather box had been opened. The exact amount of loss was not clear because the victims had died tragically and the children were young and unable to check. The court prosecutor's office sent prosecutor Zhu Zonghai and officials to inspect the scene at 2:00 PM this afternoon. It was determined that the death was caused by gunshot wounds. They then ordered the family to collect the body and wait for the arrest and punishment of the murderer. It was heard that the deceased were wealthy and were the richest people in the area. The son is fourteen years old, and the young daughter is nine years old. The younger brother, Weisheng, lives separately with his wife. The eldest daughter from his previous marriage is married to a Gu in Beimen. She heard the news and returned home to preside over the funeral and take care of the property and shop accounts. According to his son, there was one thousand yuan in cash that was just brought in on the 19th and placed under the . After checking, it was found to be missing. It is known that it was robbed.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Police Officer Files Complaint Against the Public Security Bureau Director</h3>
<p>You Jun, who used to be a police officer at the Public Security Bureau's Second Branch outside Guangfu Gate, graduated from the Zhenjiang Police Training School. In April of this year, he was ordered to be transferred to the County Public Security Bureau's police team, which has been more than two months. Last week, You suddenly drafted a petition and went to the Civil Affairs Department of the Zhenjiang Provincial Government to accuse Wu Deqing, the director of the County Public Security Bureau, of ten offenses. Director Zhao, after receiving the petition, immediately ordered You to return to Wuxi to continue his service and instructed Director Wu to reply truthfully. After receiving the order, Director Wu, on the grounds that the police officer had left without asking for leave and disrespected his superiors, ordered the police to take You Jun into custody last Sunday and await investigation and punishment. It is also heard that the police officer accused Director Wu of deducting police salaries and other offenses. It is not known how the Civil Affairs Department will investigate.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke's Mother Visits Wuxi for Sightseeing</h3>
<p>Madam Lu, the biological mother of the President of the Legislative Yuan, Sun Ke, accompanied by Yu Ming, the director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, and Rong Yi, the former director of the two-way police, and a servant, went to Suzhou for sightseeing the day before yesterday. Yesterday (20th) at 11:59 AM, they took the Shanghai-Nanjing express train to Wuxi. The director of the Wuxi Station Police Office and the Wuxi Police Inspector and others welcomed them at the station and sent police to protect them properly. After Madam Lu and others got off the train, they took rickshaws to the bottom of Gongyun Bridge, where they took a houseboat to tour Shantou and Xiaoji Mountain, went ashore for a week, and then took a car to Meiyuan and Huilu to tour the scenic spots. They also scheduled to take the 9:30 PM train to leave Wuxi and return to Shanghai that night.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Rickshaw Pullers' General Strike</h3>
<p>In Hangzhou, the heavy rain started in the afternoon of the 18th of this month and did not stop until the evening of the 19th. As a result, the tide rose sharply and mountain floods erupted. The low-lying areas of Hangzhou were knee-deep in water and became a swamp. Those who could pass through relied on rickshaw pullers to walk. On the morning of the 20th, all the rickshaw pullers in the city went on a general strike. Although there were buses that could be taken, they were ultimately limited to limited routes, so pedestrians felt greatly inconvenienced. The rickshaws in Hangzhou, through the virtuous policy of former Mayor Chen Qihuai of "Pullers Own Their Rickshaws", broke the monopoly of the various rickshaw owners and opened them for the second time. The number of vehicles has increased to more than four thousand and two hundred, of which more than four hundred and fifty rickshaw pullers who have not entered the rickshaw business pull their own rickshaws. The monthly rent, including the letter, has been reduced from thirteen yuan and five cents to twelve yuan. It is estimated that about seven or eight thousand people in the city make a living by pulling rickshaws. Because the silk industry in Hangzhou has been in a slump in recent years, unemployed workers have taken pulling rickshaws as a way out of life. Such a large city of Hangzhou, so many vehicles, are seeking a way out in motor gasoline. Except for the spring season, which can barely be maintained, the rest is really difficult to provide for the family's clothing and food with the price exchanged for sweat and blood. The reasons for this strike are: First, the city bus of the Provincial Highway Bureau has increased from Gongsanduan Road to Erlu Hugongduan, Sanlu Gengshangduan, Silu Huliuduan, and Wulu Hujian. The urban area of the six roads is almost covered by public buses, which has greatly affected the lives of rickshaw pullers. Because the government is taking advantage of the meaning of "Pullers Own Their Rickshaws", rickshaws are opened arbitrarily, which makes military men feel that they are meeting for supply. Therefore, the seven thousand rickshaw pullers of this labor god had to stop together to make a living struggle. The Rickshaw Industry Association convened a meeting of the full committee at 4:00 PM and resolved (1) to send people from each rickshaw business to take free cars with flags to various places to persuade them to resume work (2) to have the rickshaw business take people to drive and pull themselves to various places to show the appearance (3) to ask the provincial capital public security bureau to strictly prohibit rickshaw pullers from automatically deflating their tires. However, as of the time of publication, the rickshaw pullers had not yet resumed work.</p>

<h3>Stores on North Sichuan Road Staged a Strike Yesterday</h3>
<p>Collection of House Tax, Arrest of Shop Employees, Yesterday's Petition, Opening of Business Today</p>
<p>Central News Agency: The municipal government's collection of house tax in the area of the road built beyond the boundary on North Sichuan Road has aroused opposition from residents there. From 8:00 AM yesterday, more than one hundred shops from Laobazi Road to the end of North Sichuan Road unanimously declared a strike. The Shanghai First Special Zone Citizens' General Association also specially sent the association's supervisory committee member, Mr. Yu Qiaqing, to visit Secretary-General Yu Hongjun of the municipal government yesterday morning to request a postponement of the collection. After consideration by the municipal government, it agreed that it would never send personnel to collect before the issue of the road built beyond the boundary was resolved. Therefore, the stores there have decided that representatives of the Citizens' General Association, such as Yu Qiaqing, will go there at 11:00 AM this morning to explain the opening of business. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>[Cause of the Dispute]</p>
<p>Before the January 28th Incident, there were more than five hundred stores on North Sichuan Road from Laobazi Road to the south of Shikuta Road. Only more than two hundred stores have recovered after the war, and the business situation is very bleak. The municipal government, due to financial difficulties, planned to collect house tax there from this month to subsidize the situation. However, the stores there have never paid this tax to the municipal government or the Public Works Department because they are located in the area of the road built beyond the boundary, and because the original energy has not recovered after the war, they rose up to oppose it. As a result, a dispute occurred with the Fifth District Second Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau the day before yesterday, and four shop employees were arrested by the police station. Upon hearing the news, the stores there immediately sent representatives to the municipal government to petition, demanding the release of the arrested shop employees.</p>
<h3>A GlimPSE OF THE SHUTDOWN ON NORTH SICHUAN ROAD (Photographed by China Photography Supply Society)</h3>
<p>Release, greeted by Section Chief Yuan Xinglu of the Second Section, regarding the permission to release the arrested shop employees. Unexpectedly, even by the evening before last, the shops in that area had not been released, considering that the Second Branch of the Fifth District was not complying with the orders of the Municipal Government and was deliberately making things difficult. Therefore, starting from 8:00 AM yesterday, each shop posted slogans on their windows demanding the release of the arrested shop employees.</p>
<h3>MARKET SHUTDOWN YESTERDAY MORNING</h3>
<p>The slogans read: "Petition the Municipal Government to rescue shop employees, the Municipal Government has already agreed to release them, but the Second Branch of the Fifth District continues to detain them. Closing business expresses our determination," and similar wording. The Lianchang Hardware Store at the Hongjiang Road intersection also posted similar signs at 8:30 AM. (Police officers stationed in the area by the police station intervened, and the shop employees closed the iron gate. At that time, a police officer's finger was caught in the door, causing a misunderstanding. The police officer immediately detained all the shop employees at the Second Branch of the Fifth District, leading to resentment among the shops, who mutually agreed to shut down their businesses and went to the 25th District Branch of the General Chamber of Commerce to discuss negotiation methods, deciding on three conditions: (1) Request a temporary suspension of property tax collection until the issue of road construction beyond the boundary is resolved; (2) Release the detained shop employees; (3) Regarding the arbitrary arrest of shop employees by police officers of the Second Branch of the Fifth District, demand dismissal and investigation, and a guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future. Furthermore, Supervising Committee Member Yu Qiaqing of the General Chamber of Commerce was designated to petition the Municipal Government.</p>
<h3>THE PETITION PROCESS</h3>
<p>Yu Qiaqing went to the Municipal Government at 11:00 AM yesterday to meet with Mayor Wu, who was represented by Secretary-General Yu Hongjun. He asked the Municipal Government to consider the difficulties of businesses and approve the acceptance of their demands. The arrested shop employees were released at 11:30 AM yesterday morning. Representative Yu immediately returned to the chamber of commerce to report back to the Citizens' Federation and convened a joint meeting again at 3:00 PM in the afternoon, sending a letter to the 25th District Branch reporting on the negotiation situation, stating roughly that in the case of the Second Branch of the Fifth District illegally detaining citizens Jin Jusheng and others, the chamber had appointed Supervising Committee Member Mr. Yu Qiaqing to negotiate with the Municipal Government. Secretary-General Yu received him, and Mr. Yu stated his views, saying that before the issue of road construction beyond the boundary is resolved, citizens do not seem to have protection, so please temporarily suspend the collection of this donation. According to Secretary-General Yu's response, regarding the overall donation for that area, the collection will definitely not be carried out by personnel before the road issue is resolved. Please convey this to the citizens there to clarify the misunderstanding. Regarding the third condition, he will reply after the chamber convenes a representative meeting tomorrow afternoon.</p>
<h3>BUSINESS OPENING THIS MORNING</h3>
<p>The chamber has decided that at 11:00 AM today, representatives of the General Chamber of Commerce, including Yu Qiaqing, Zhang Yiren, Hu Xiang, Chen Binghui, and Liu Zhongying, will go to that area to explain the situation to the shops that have shut down, and then they will open their businesses and operate as usual.</p>

In the Afternoon, He Was Able to See the Efficiency Electricity of the Car Affairs Office, and He Thought He Was Invited to Review It. Our Delegation Returned Home That Night and Telegraphed It. The Jinghu Section Salary Increase Campaign Delegation Effictively Knocked.</p>
<h3>SHANGHAI HANGZHOU ELECTRICAL INQUIRY</h3>
<p>In Addition to Sending a Representative to Come to Shanghai From Jiaxing to Contact the Jinghu Section Petition Representatives, the Shanghai Hangzhou Section Salary Increase Campaign Delegation Again Telegraphed Shanghai Yesterday to Inquire, The Committee and Union Council of the Two-Road Party Headquarters Are Transferred to You. Have You Negotiated With the Bureau Regarding the Salary Increase Case Inquired About in the Xidian, and Has There Been Any Indication of the Negotiation Situation, and the Group Emotions Are Erroneous. Shanghai Hangzhou Section Branch Office Hao Is Specially Electricity. As for the Representatives Who Came to Shanghai, They Have Returned to Jiaxing Yesterday Morning to Report the Reply and the Petition Situation of the Jinghu Section.</p>
<h3>THE ATTITUDE OF THE WORKERS</h3>
<p>The Two-Road Administration Yesterday Recorded the Electrical Indication Method of the Ministry of Railways on the Two-Road Daily News to Inform the Staff. As for the Salary Increase Campaign Representatives of the Jinghu and Shanghai Hangzhou Roads, They Decided to Report the Reply to Each Station First and Decide on the Future Policy on the Same Day After Returning to Each.</p>
<h3>YONGSHAO RESPONSE</h3>
<p>The Two-Road Union Received a Telegram From Ningbo, Saying, The Chief of Shanghai North Station Is Requested to Explore and Send It to the Shanghai Salary Increase Campaign Delegation and Forward It to the Party Headquarters and Union of the Two Roads for Public Reference. Xiao Electricity Is Known in Detail. All Members of This 叚 Unanimously Support and Swear to Be the Backers, and This Electricity Will Be Heard. The Council of Secretaries of the Yongshao Section Branch Office. Hao Yin.</p>
<h3>THE BUREAU'S STATEMENT</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency Reporter Asked the Railway Bureau About the Handling Situation of the Salary Increase Matter of the Staff of the Jinghu Huhangyong Railway Administration Yesterday. The Person in Charge of the Bureau Expressed a Few Points: (1) Salary Increase Is a Kind of Staff Assessment, and the Ministry of Railways Has Regulations. Because the Methods Used by the Two Roads Before, the Ministry of Railways Believes That It Is Not Appropriate, So It Has Requested the Ministry of Railways for Instructions. At That Time, It Was Still Between February and March of This Year, and the Ministry of Railways Also Said That All Parties Should Be Taken Into Account, and It Will Be Evaluated in Detail. At That Time, the Staff of Each Department Said That They Wanted to Request a Salary Increase. The Bureau Ordered All Offices to Explain That the Salary Increase Incident Was Being Handled and Ordered the Heads of All Offices to Be Responsible for Persuading Them to Stop. Now It Has Reached June, Which Is the End of the Year. It Is the Period When the Administrative Organs Routinely Assess Their Performance. The Bureau Applied to the Ministry of Railways Again, and Director Huang Asked Minister Gu in Person in Shanghai. The Method Has Been Largely Decided and Has Been Published in Accordance With the Order of the Ministry. Yi Yu Has This Salary Increase Campaign by the Car Affairs Staff of the Two Roads at This Time. Outsiders Do Not Know That the Result of the Staff Campaign Is Considered, But It Has Nothing to Do With It at All. (2) Only the Car Affairs Department Participated in the Salary Increase Campaign on the Two Roads This Time, and the General Affairs, Engineering Affairs, Aircraft Affairs, Materials, Accounting, and Police Departments Had Nothing to Do With It. The Bureau Heard About the Campaign, Because of the National Program, It Instructed the Car Affairs Department to Reiterate the Admonition. Minister Gu Was Also Personally Instructed Director Huang in Shanghai, and After Returning to the Ministry, He Ordered the Bureau to Deal With It Strictly. Therefore, the Bureau's Assessment and Salary Increase Are Handled According to the Law and Will Never Be Implemented Because the Staff Demands It, and Will Never Be Stopped Because the Staff Does Not Demand It. (3) The Car Affairs Staff of the Jinghu Road Went to the Bureau the Day Before Yesterday to Petition. Although Director Huang Met Him, Director Huang Stated That He Did Not Recognize His Qualification as a Representative of the Salary Increase Campaign Delegation, but Recognized His Identity as a Staff Member and Gave a Lecture. He First Ordered One Person to State His Intention, and Then Director Huang Explained That the Staff Is Assessed Every Year, and Those With Excellent Results Will Get a Salary Increase. The Ministry Has Its Own Methods, and the Director Should Be Responsible for Handling the Legal Interests of Each Staff Member, but the Director Cannot Hope to Accept the Staff's Unreasonable Demands. Then He Pointed Out That the Unauthorized Issuance of Telegrams, Unauthorized Absence From Duty, Etc. Were Inappropriate, and That the Two Roads Were Managed by the Country, and the Director Represented the Country in Management, Not a Capitalist. Now the Staff's Demand to Set a Deadline for a Reply Is Not Without a Sense of Betraying Government Orders. Finally, Each Staff Member Still Asked How the Salary Increase Matter Was. The Director Told That He Could Not Reply, But the Assessment at the End of June Was Ordered to Be Published by Each Office Director in the Daily News Tomorrow (That Is, Today).</p>

According to Soong, She Had Already Published a Statement Regarding the Assassination of Mr. Yang. The Affairs of the China League for Civil Rights Will Naturally Continue to Be Carried Out.

<h3>THE SECOND BATCH OF STUDENTS EXPELLED FROM JAPAN ARRIVED IN SHANGHAI YESTERDAY</h3>
<p>Wu Han and Other Six People</p>

<h3>THE ORDERING PROCESS OF THE TIANCHU NO. 1 AIRCRAFT</h3>
<p>Valued at 125,000 National Currency Units. It Was Unloaded Yesterday and Temporarily Stored in a Warehouse for Pickup. The Steel Fuselage Will Be Assembled at Hongqiao. According to Xinxin News Agency, the Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory's Tianchu No. 1 Aircraft Was Ordered From the German Junkers Factory by Chan Sin Foreign Company to Order a Junkers-Type Fighter Plane. It Was Shipped From Hamburg and Separately Loaded on the Asaer</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>On the Esser Wheel and the Pam Blum Bolo Two Wheels One After Another Arrived in Shanghai. Because the Passport Procedures Took a Long Time and Because of the Rain, It Was Delayed Until Yesterday to Be Unloaded and Temporarily Stored in the Hailan Warehouse for Pickup. The Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory Was Unwilling to Announce It Because of Various Considerations. The Reporter of Xinxin News Agency Met Ding Ruisheng, the Chinese Manager of Chan Sin Foreign Company, Yesterday to Inquire About Everything. The Details Are Recorded Below.</p>
<h3>FUSELAGE STYLE</h3>
<p>Mr. Ding Turned Out the Order Form, and the Style of Its Order Is as Follows: The Tianchu Aircraft Is a Junkers K47 Land Monoplane Fighter Plane Manufactured by the German Junkers Factory. It Is All Made of Aluminum Steel. It Is a Good Nat Air-Cooled Engine With 5254 Horsepower. The Speed Is 168 Miles Per Hour When Flying Low, and 13,100 Feet Per Hour When Flying High. The Load Is 590 Qi Luo. It Needs 345 Liters of Gasoline and 45 Liters of Sliding Oil. The Endurance Time Is 3 and a Half Hours. There Are 2 Seats and 3 Machine Guns, Which Are Manufactured by the Danish "Madsen" Factory. The Caliber Is 79 Li, 2 of Which Are Fixed and 1 of Which Can Be Moved at Will. There Are 3,000 Rounds of Bullets.</p>
<h3>"ORDERING PROCESS"</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Ding, Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory Signed a Contract With Chan Sin Foreign Company on March 15 to Order a Junkers-Type Fighter Plane From the German Junkers Factory, Which Cost 22,000 Pounds in US Dollars, Which Is About 125,000 National Currency Units. The Aircraft Was Shipped From Hamburg, and Because There Were Too Many Materials, It Was Separately Loaded on the Esser Wheel of the American Most Ship Company and the Pam Blum Bolo Wheel of the Yi Tai Company. They Set Off Months Ago and Arrived in Shanghai One After Another. Because the Aviation Association Applied to the Aviation Administration for a Passport and a Tax-Free Import Certificate From the Ministry of Finance, It Took a Long Time to Process and Because of the Rain, It Was Delayed Until Yesterday to Be Unloaded. However, the Tax-Free Certificate From the Ministry of Finance Has Not Been Signed, So the Aircraft Is Temporarily Stored in the Customs Warehouse for Pickup After Being Unloaded.</p>
<h3>"EXCERPT OF ADVANTAGES"</h3>
<p>The Reporter Asked About the Advantages of the Junkers-Type Aircraft. According to Mr. Ding, Junkers Is an All-Metal Aircraft, All Made of Special Lightest Aluminum Steel and Has the Highest Rigidity. There Is Never Any Danger of Fire and Destruction. It Can Avoid Wind and Rain and Is Not Affected by Climate Change. Compared With Ordinary Cloth-Wing Wood or Steel Pipe Aircraft, Its Durability Is Not the Same. This Aircraft Is Extremely Easy to Repair, and Even Minor Damage Can Still Fly Normally. The Aluminum Steel Is Extremely Tough and Is Not as Easy to Break as Other Materials. Junkers Aircraft Is a Low-Leaf Type, With Double Wings at the Lower End of the Fuselage. If Obstacles Occur During Descent, the Double Wings Will Land First, Which Can Avoid Damage to the Fuselage, So It Is Safer Than Other Types of Aircraft. Its Main Features Are as Follows: (1) the Wings and Fuselage Are All Made of Aluminum Steel, and They Can Fly in Both Sunny and Rainy Weather. In Wartime, They Can Be Placed in the Open Air Anywhere and Wait for Orders to Depart at Any Time. If It Is a Wooden Cloth-Wing Aircraft, It Must Have a Hangar. Other Types of Aircraft Will Be Damaged if They Are Buried in the Snow for a Long Time. Junkers Aircraft Was Once Buried in the Snow for Several Months During a Battle. After Being Taken Out of the Snow, It Was as Good as New. (2) Even if the Wings and Fuselage Are Hit by Enemy Bullets, They Will Not Lose Their Combat Effectiveness. (3) The Carrying Capacity Is Very Large, So It Can Carry More Military Supplies at a Time Than Other Aircraft, and the Machine Gun That Shoots Through the Propeller Is Especially a Feature. (4) the Machine Gun Is Equipped With a Very Long Range and Extremely Powerful. All the Sights and Telescopes Are the Latest Type.</p>
<h3>"HONGQIAO ASSEMBLY"</h3>
<p>After the Aircraft Is Picked Up, It Will Be Transported to the Hongqiao Aircraft Field and Assembled by the Mechanics of the Junkers Aircraft Factory. The Aviation Association Has Emailed the Aviation Administration to Allow It to Be Stored and Asked the Guarding Officers and Soldiers of the Aircraft Field to Be Responsible for Protection. After the Assembly Time Is Determined, It Will Be Scheduled for a Test Flight and Naming Ceremony.</p>
<h3>NIE KAIYI RETURNED TO SHANGHAI YESTERDAY</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Guangdong Line Will Be Test-Flown Next Month</p>
<p>Nie Kaiyi, Deputy Director of the Aircraft Navigation Group of China Aviation Corporation, Went to Wenzhou to Prepare the Airport Radio Station and Returned to Shanghai the Day Before Yesterday. According to Nie Yesterday,</p>
<p>The Preparations at Each Station Have Been Completed. After Arriving in Wenzhou, I Immediately Started to Prepare Various Items. The Airport Has Now Been Surveyed and Determined to Be the Jiangmian in Front of the Texaco Oil Company Warehouse, Which Can Be Used. The Office Has Also Leased the No. 8 House in Shiban Lane in the City for Office Use. The Radio Station Has Been Rushing to Install It These Days and Will Be Completed in About Two Weeks, So I Returned to Shanghai on the Haiyan Wheel the Day Before Yesterday.</p>
<p>The Newly Purchased Sykes Aircraft Will Be Test-Flown Next Month and Will Be Allowed to Arrive in Shanghai on the 26th of This Month. After Arriving in Port, It Still Needs to Be Picked Up and Installed. After the Installation, It Will Be Test-Flown in Shanghai First, and Then It Can Be Applied. The Rumor That It Will Open on July 8 Is Actually Too Late. It Can Be Test-Flown Around Next Month, Because the Radio Stations at Each Station Can Be Installed and Completed in Two Weeks. As for the Official Opening Date, It Will Be in August.</p>
<p>The Whole Line Is Temporarily Set Up With Three Stations. The Shanghai-Guangdong Line Is Temporarily Set Up With Three Stations: Wenzhou, Xiamen, and Guangzhou. Other Places, Such as Shantou and Fuzhou, Will Be Set Up in the Future. The New Sykes Aircraft (the Aircraft Has 1,500 Horsepower) Will Be Used From Shanghai to Guangzhou. If Flying Along the Coast, It Will Take 9 Hours. Following the Land Will Only Take 8 Hours to Reach Guangzhou Directly. In the Future, the Route Will Follow the Coast and the Land, Which Will Have to Wait Until the Test Flight to Determine. The Airport Planned to Be Set Up in Nantong Is a Prepared Airport. It Is Not True That the Shanghai-Ping Line Will Set Up a Station in Tong.</p>
<p>General Li Du's Representative</p>
<p>Wang Ziyao Flew to Xinjiang Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>To Inspect His Troops and Contact the Logistics Problem. Liu Piguang Went to Beijing to Report That Li Was Returning to China. General Li Du Took the Counter Fandi Wheel on the 14th and Headed Back to China. He Should Arrive in Shanghai on the 10th of Next Month. General Li's Representative in Shanghai, Liu Piguang, Went to Beijing the Day Before Yesterday to Report to the Central Government. Wang Ziyao, the Deputy Adjutant of Li's Troops, Was Ordered by General Li to Fly to Xinjiang on the Eurasian Airlines Passenger Plane at 9:30 Yesterday Morning to Inspect the Troops Stationed in Xinjiang on Behalf of General Li, Instructing Them to Obey the Orders of Huang Xuanwei, Keep the Border Safe, and Secure the Local Area. At the Same Time, Wang Was Also Entrusted With the Order of the Military Commission to Comfort the Northeast Anti-Japanese Soldiers Who Returned From Russia and Contact the Logistics Problem. Wang Is Scheduled to Stay in Xinjiang for a Week and Will Still Take the Eurasian Airlines Passenger Plane Back to Shanghai to Greet General Li and Report Everything.</p>
<p>After the Philippine Inspection Team Returned to the Philippines, There Was No Progress in Sino-Philippine Trade</p>
<p>The Team's Purpose in Coming to China Was Very Different From the Wishes of Our Chinese Businessmen to Promote Philippine Goods. The Representatives of the Philippine Business Community Organized a Business Inspection Team and an International Friendship Tourism Group Last Month to Go to Japan and Come to China to Inspect the Status of Industries and Were Warmly Welcomed by Our Officials and Businessmen. After the Matter Was Completed, They Left Shanghai and Returned to the Philippines for Many Days, but There Was No Progress in Sino-Philippine Trade. The Guowen News Agency Reporter Inquired From All Parties Yesterday, and the Reasons Are as Left.</p>
<h3>NO MESSAGE FOUND</h3>
<p>The Philippine Industrial Inspection Team Stayed in Shanghai and Turned to Beijing for Several Months Last Month. Mayor Wu Tiecheng of This City Entertained Diligently and Exhausted the Friendship of the Place, While the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and the Pacific Association of the City Chamber of Commerce and Other Groups Welcomed and Sent Them Off and Held a Banquet to Entertain Them. The Trade Bureau and the City Chamber of Commerce Had Close Discussions With the Chairman of the Team, Wen Jiang, and Others to Seek to Develop the Export of Chinese Goods to the Philippines, but There Were No Concrete Results. Unexpectedly, After the Inspection Team Returned to the Philippines, There Has Been No News So Far. Not Only Is There No Intention to Discuss Sino-Philippine Trade, but There Is Also No Letter of Gratitude for the Entertainment, Which Is Very Lacking in International Etiquette. All Parties Who Entertained the Team Felt Very Surprised.</p>
<h3>PURPOSE OF COMING TO CHINA</h3>
<p>According to a Thorough Understanding of the Situation in the Philippine Islands, the Purpose of the Philippine Inspection Team's Coming to China Was Not to Absorb Chinese Goods, but to Promote Philippine Goods to China. Its Wishes Were Very Different From Those of Our Country's Business Community. The Sales Channels of Goods on the Philippine Islands Depend Solely on the United States. Now the Filipinos Are Doing Their Best to Restore Freedom and Proceed With Independence, Which Will Inevitably Have a Significant Impact on Exports to the United States, So They Want to Switch to Japan or China to Find a Market and Replace the Big American Customers. Seeing That Japan Only Has Outward Dumping and No Reason to Buy Foreign Goods, and Our Country Hopes to Develop Exports to the Philippines, Which Is Contrary to Their Inspection Wishes, So After Returning to the Philippines, There Has Been No News. Recalling That When the Team Returned to the Philippines, a Tea Merchant and an Egg Merchant in This Port Each Packed a Large Piece of Tea and Eggs as Samples and Handed Them Over to Be Taken Back to the Philippines. Unexpectedly, After Being Taken Away by the Team, There Has Been No Reply to Shanghai So Far. It Is as If the Two Samples Have Been Given to the Team as Gifts From the Chinese Businessmen.</p>
<h3>The "Gongli" Steamer Stranded at Dabu</h3>
<p>The "Gongli" steamer, belonging to the Zhengji Company, which set out from Haizhou, encountered an accident at Dabu Estuary. News arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, detailed as follows:</p>
<p>Discharge of Cargo and Departure The "Gongli" steamer, with a deadweight of approximately 1,800 tons, loaded a large quantity of goods in Qingdao and unloaded them in Haizhou. On the 10th of this month, it arrived at Dabu Port, berthed at the dock, and discharged all cargo from the holds. However, due to a lack of outbound cargo, it prepared to return empty to Qingdao after clearing the ship. Tragically, disaster struck immediately after untying the mooring lines.</p>
<p>Pressure from the Spring Tide Recently, Haizhou has been experiencing spring tides. As the steamer left the Dabu dock, it coincided with the peak surge of the "Hutou Tide" (the local name for the spring tide in Dabu Port). The force and pressure of the water were exceptionally strong. As the steamer was releasing the shore-side mooring lines, but before the outer anchor chain had been raised, the spring tide arrived. The hull, being empty and without cargo, was unable to withstand the impact. The hull immediately heeled over towards the dock.</p>
<p>Hull Capsized and Hold Swept Away In a short time, the hull was swept by the raging tide and keeled over towards the dock. It was impossible to salvage the situation. Moreover, the speed of the capsize was extremely rapid; in less than three minutes, the entire ship was lying on its side on the water. The crew, firemen, and sailors were all working when the hull suddenly capsized. Many were unable to escape and had to jump into the harbor. Dabu Port was thrown into chaos, with nearby small boats rushing to rescue those in the water. Fortunately, there were no passengers on board, and all of the crew and sailors who had fallen into the water were rescued.</p>
<p>Shipowner's Desperate Rescue Within three minutes, the ship's bottom gradually became exposed, indicating the imminent danger of the ship capsizing completely. At this critical moment, the shipowner, Mr. Zhu, urgently engaged the engine to wind up the outer anchor chain that had not yet been raised. Using the force of this single anchor, he managed to hold the hull, thus preventing it from completely capsizing and sinking, thanks to the restraining pull of this anchor.</p>
<p>Stranded on the Shore The shipowner seized the opportunity to quickly maneuver the steamer to a shallow area near Dabu Port, where the hull became stranded. If not for this action, it would have been difficult to ensure the safety of the ship. Yesterday, news arrived here, sent by the shipowner via telegram to the head office, requesting assistance in towing and rescuing the vessel. When the hull capsized, many items inside the ship were lost, and the hull also sustained damage. However, the period of greatest danger has passed, and only towing and repair are now required.</p>
<p>The Fuxing Trust Company Renamed as the Shanghai Fuxing Trust Cooperative</p>
<p>Fully Government-Funded to Support Reconstruction</p>
<p>The Shanghai Fuxing Trust Company has now been officially renamed the Shanghai Fuxing Trust Cooperative, with a capital of 1.5 million yuan. It was previously planned as a joint government-private venture, but after discussions by the Municipal Government and the Municipal Affairs Conference, it has been decided that it will be fully government-funded to support the progress of reconstruction efforts. Preparations are complete, and it will officially open soon.</p>
<p>Record of Notable People's Movements</p>
<p>Sun Ke took the night train to Beijing last night. Wu Tiecheng took the express train to Beijing at one o'clock this morning. Chen Shaokuan and Chu Minyi took the train from Beijing last night and arrived in Shanghai this morning.</p>
<p>Wang Zhengting returned to Shanghai the night before last from Beijing via Pingjin (Beiping and Tianjin).</p>
<p>The Bereaved Servicemen's Nurturing Association Appropriates 5,000 Yuan to Aid Families of the Fallen</p>
<p>To be Handled at the Discretion of Qu Yingguang and Others</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bereaved Servicemen's Nurturing Association had previously allocated 10,000 yuan to aid families of the fallen servicemen. The association had received a telegram from Qu Yingguang and Feng Xuefen stating that the sum was insufficient. Yesterday, an additional 5,000 yuan was allocated for relief. The association's original letter to Mr. Qu is recorded below: Respectfully replying, we received your letter stating that the number of servicemen and volunteer soldiers killed in action at the various passes along the Great Wall is considerable. The previously allocated donation of 10,000 yuan is truly impossible to distribute. We seek further detailed instructions on how to proceed. This was submitted to the Standing Committee meeting of the association on the 16th of this month. It was decided that, since the establishment of the association, the total donations received, excluding disbursements, amount to just over 20,000 yuan. The initial purpose of the association was to nurture the families of the servicemen killed in action during the Songhu (Shanghai) battles. Most of the donors at that time shared this sentiment. The rosters of the officers and soldiers killed in action in the various armies that participated in the Songhu battles have now been sent to the association. We are currently reviewing them according to regulations, separately planning methods for nurturing. All donated funds, aside from respectfully allocating some to aid the families of the Northeastern soldiers, must still consider the original plan to nurture the families of those killed in the Songhu battles, hoping to fulfill the initial intention. However, having been informed of the dire situation of the families of the servicemen killed in action at the Great Wall passes, we must do our best to provide relief to repay their loyalty and service. We are now allocating an additional donation of 5,000 yuan, which we ask you to use to address the difficulties, consider the circumstances, and manage accordingly. (remainder omitted)</p>
<h3>Joint Conference of the Postal Workers' Unions After the Passage of the Consolidation of Postal System Case</h3>
<p>Earnestly Hope for the Early Realization of the Plan The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union and the Shanghai Postal Workers' Association held a joint executive and supervisory committee meeting at the Postal Workers' Club on the morning of June 19th at 10:00 AM. Those in attendance included: Xu Duo, Hong Wenqi, Zhang Dianjia, Fan Caicong, Xiao Qingshan, Wang Kai, Lu Keming, Gao Zhicheng, Zhu Jingsheng, Xu Yingsan, Xu Ziqin, Shi Yitang, Shen Songzhou, Zhou Yundong, Cheng Zuoqing, Qi Jiamou, Ge Fei, Shi Jiuyuan, Cao Chongye, Wang Dongming, Wu Yanbin, Chen Shengyang, Huang Gongfu, Zhang Xiyang, and Kang Luo. Those present as observers included: Zhang Kechang, Zhao Shusheng, and Lu Jingshi, and Zhu Xuefan. The meeting was chaired by Zhu Jingsheng, and the minutes were recorded by Fan Caicong. ⑴ Formalities were observed. ⑵ Report on Matters: (A) The chairman reported on the main purpose of the meeting, stating that the joint meeting of the two unions was convened to provide a general report to the committee members on the circumstances of the implementation outline for the Consolidation of Postal System plan passed by the Postal Research Association, and to discuss how to promote the implementation of the plan. Looking back at the establishment of the Postal Research Association more than a year ago, the outline has only now been passed. On the Postal Research Association side, they naturally consider the result satisfactory. However, from the perspective of the two unions, it is always considered that it is far from the original proposed plan, and cannot be considered satisfactory, that is, cannot be considered a success. However, in view of the enthusiasm and determination of the mediation committee members, and the seriousness of the national crisis, it was not desired to allow it to be delayed again, causing further complications. Therefore, the expression of the Postal Research Committee’s continued responsibility was respected, in order to seek a reasonable solution. However, the date of implementation still depends on the approval of the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan, and the implementation of the Ministry of Communications. The road ahead is full of thorns, and the responsibility of the two unions has not yet ended. At this time, it is appropriate to determine the direction and continue to work hard, so as not to fail the heavy trust placed in them by postal workers across the country. As for the question of when the Remittance Bureau will be abolished, how the Supervisory Committee will be organized, and the cessation of subsidies to airline companies, all depend on the strict supervision of the two unions. During this period of more than a year, the representatives of the two unions have been able to consistently adhere to their original intentions, abide by the spirit of the resolutions passed by the two unions in the past, and work tirelessly to negotiate and coordinate. They have worked hard despite disagreements and misunderstandings, in order to reach a reasonable solution today. The chairman respectfully represents the two unions in expressing deep appreciation, and hopes that all representatives will maintain their inherent spirit and continue to work hard to promote the early implementation of the plan. The two unions have endless hope in this regard. (B) Representative Shi Yitang reported on the proceedings of the last meeting. At the last meeting of the Postal Research Association on the 15th of this month, the issue of the appointment of existing personnel in the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau was discussed. Clause 3 of item D, stating "to be employed only after passing an evaluation," and clause 1 of item E regarding the treatment of Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau personnel, stating "in accordance with postal regulations," were passed. At that time, the representatives of the workers stated that "to be employed only after passing an evaluation" should mean that they become postal personnel and are included in the postal ranks, and asked the chairman to interpret the clause. The chairman replied that the meaning of the wording of the clause was already very clear and did not need clarification (the statement was approved by the chairman to be recorded in the minutes of the meeting). Regarding the implementation of the entire plan, the chairman and the research committee members all expressed their continued responsibility to supervise the government in order to consolidate the foundation of the postal system. (C) Representative Zhang Kechang read out the articles of the implementation outline of the plan passed by the Postal Research Association and provided explanations. ⑶ Matters for Discussion: 1. The Postal Economic System Research Committee has passed the implementation outline for the Consolidation of Postal System plan and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for adoption and implementation. How should the two unions express their views? Please submit the case for discussion. Resolution (in principle): Although the implementation outline for the Consolidation of Postal System plan passed by the Postal System Research Committee does not violate the principles of the Consolidation of Postal System plan, the proposed methods are far from the original. However, the provisions of the outline regarding the abolition of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, the cessation of airline subsidies, and the establishment of a Postal Savings Supervisory Committee are all considered by the two unions to be urgent measures to save the postal system, and the government should be urged to implement them as soon as possible. As for the entire Consolidation of Postal System plan, the two unions have decided to maintain their original intentions, unite postal workers across the country, and continue to work hard to promote its realization. Through the following methods: 1. The two unions should report the proceedings of the Postal System Research Committee to the General Federation separately and request that they be recorded for future reference. 2. The two unions should issue a declaration and publicly appoint comrades Ge Fei and Zhao Shusheng to be responsible for drafting it, and submit it to the Standing Committee of the two unions for review and publication. 3. The two unions should appoint representatives to carry a letter and personally request the research committee members to make efforts to supervise the government to implement the passed plan as soon as possible. 2. The chairman of the Postal System Research Committee and the mediation committee members have accepted the Consolidation of Postal System plan proposed by the two unions and are responsible for mediation, which is quite laborious. How should the two unions express their gratitude? Resolution: To be handled by the Standing Committee of the two unions. ⑷ Meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>The Two Railway Bureaus Revamp Passenger Transport Services for Third and Fourth Class</h3>
<p>The number of passengers traveling daily on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways is greatest in the third and fourth classes. It is undeniable that the seating is crowded and the equipment is basic. The authorities, recognizing this, have separately ordered the Traffic and Mechanical Departments to consult on a revamp plan to be thoroughly implemented. The plan has now been produced by the two departments, and the original text is excerpted as follows:</p>
<h3>Remedies for Overcrowding</h3>
<p>Third- and fourth-class passengers on both railways are notoriously crowded, especially on the Beijing-Shanghai line. To improve the situation, the following points should be addressed first: (A) Purchasing More Cars. Both railways have a shortage of third- and fourth-class passenger cars and have repeatedly submitted requests to purchase more. The Beijing-Shanghai line currently has sixty-eight third-class passenger cars and only forty-nine fourth-class passenger cars, twenty-nine of which were converted from freight cars. The car bodies are made of inferior pine wood and are not durable. After several years of operation, they are dilapidated. The Shanghai-Hangzhou line currently has forty-one third-class passenger cars and nineteen fourth-class passenger cars. Most of the fourth-class passenger cars were converted from freight cars. In addition to the heavily trafficked train numbers running every day, a number of cars need to be rotated for repairs. Under these circumstances, overcrowding is inevitable. Therefore, the requested purchase of third-class passenger cars should be expedited to fundamentally improve the situation. Once the new third-class passenger cars are purchased, it is proposed that the older and smaller existing third-class passenger cars be converted to fourth-class. At the same time, the fourth-class passenger cars converted from freight cars should be restored to their original state. In this way, not only will overcrowding be gradually reduced, but travel comfort will also be greatly improved. (B) Purchasing More Locomotives. The locomotives on both railways, except for the G-type locomotives on the Beijing-Shanghai line, are mostly very old. Furthermore, due to their small number, they rarely have sufficient time to rest after running. According to the Mechanical Department, their traction power is inherently too small, and the number of cars that each train can pull must be limited. Once the vehicles are purchased and the number of operational passenger cars increases, purchasing locomotives with greater traction will be a necessity. Only locomotives with greater traction can pull a greater number of vehicles and alleviate overcrowding. The number of locomotives to be purchased has also been jointly determined by the two departments and submitted for approval. (C) Rebuilding Seats. Except for a very small number, all third- and fourth-class passenger cars on both railways have seats arranged in four longitudinal rows. This arrangement may appear to provide more seating surface than the transverse rows in the first- and second-class cars. However, in reality, the opposite is true. Passengers who board first tend to occupy seats at both ends of the car, while there are many empty seats in the center. Moreover, it is inconvenient for passengers to enter and exit when seated in rows. Therefore, seat improvement is also a necessity. Except for fourth-class passenger cars, which require special consideration and whose rebuilding must wait, the existing third-class passenger cars are now being sent by the Traffic Department to the Mechanical Department, which then orders the machine shop to rebuild the seats one by one into transverse-row seating for the convenience of passengers.</p>
<h3>Improving Equipment</h3>
<p>The basic nature of the equipment inside the third- and fourth-class passenger cars on both railways cannot be concealed, especially in the fourth-class cars. Everything from car windows and awnings to toilets is either dilapidated or completely missing, and a fundamental reform is urgently needed to improve the equipment. The Mechanical Department should address the following points based on the economic situation of the railway: (A) Increasing the number of electric lights inside the car and increasing their brightness. (B) Installing retractable tea tables at the window between two seats in the third-class cars. (C) Enlarging the luggage racks in the fourth-class cars. (D) Improving and enlarging the toilets in the fourth-class cars and installing separate fixtures for urination and defecation and water tanks. (E) Enlarging and widening the doors of the fourth-class cars. (F) Enlarging the windows inside the fourth-class cars. (G) Adding handrails at both ends of the fourth-class cars at the entrances and exits. (H) Adding gangway awnings and iron plates to the fourth-class cars and rebuilding the steps to match those of the third-class cars. (I) Adding ventilation holes inside the third- and fourth-class cars. In addition, advertisements inside the passenger cars that obstruct the view have been ordered by the Traffic Department to be completely removed. Furthermore, for the convenience of third- and fourth-class passengers, it is planned to install automatic tea dispensers inside the cars. The dispensers will store hot water and can dispense three kinds of tea. A coal stove will be placed below to maintain the temperature of the tea. Each time a copper coin is inserted, the dispenser will automatically dispense a cup of tea for passengers to take at any time. This plan is currently being devised by the Traffic Department. However, after the implementation of this measure, the Beijing-Shanghai line will lose 4,000 yuan in handling fees per month, and the Shanghai-Hangzhou line will lose 3,250 yuan in handling fees per month. In addition, adding the cost of equipment per car, the total cost of adding tea dispensers will be approximately 12,150 yuan. The losses and expenses are very large. Once the plan is finalized, it will be submitted for approval. As for the cleanliness of third- and fourth-class passenger cars, the Traffic Department will order the cleaning personnel on both railways to conduct strict inspections and strictly order car attendants to pay extra attention to hygiene. As for the sale of miscellaneous goods inside the passenger cars, which interferes with travel, the Traffic Department has already implemented a ban. In addition, the cleanliness of the stations is also an important matter. The measures have been described in detail previously.</p>
<h3>Uniformity of Appearance</h3>
<p>Except for the third-class passenger cars on the Beijing-Shanghai line, which still have a uniform appearance, most of the third-class cars on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo line were converted from old cars of the former Shanghai-Zhejiang Railway, so their appearance is not uniform. The fourth-class passenger cars on both railways are already quite disparate. After converting the ironwood awning cars into fourth-class passenger cars, their appearance became even more disjointed, resulting in cars of varying heights within the same train, which is unsightly. The proposed solution is to purchase more third-class cars, convert the smaller existing cars into fourth-class cars, and at the same time completely eliminate all of the fourth-class ironwood awning cars and convert them back into freight cars. In addition, the exterior of the car bodies will be repainted to make them eye-catching and impressive.</p>
<h3>Letter from the Taxpayers' Association to the Municipal Council</h3>
<p>Letter from the Taxpayers' Association to the Municipal Council of the Public Concession</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Municipal Council yesterday, which stated: Respectfully informing you that the Shanghai Hotel Association has sent a letter stating that it recently received a letter from the Municipal Council of the Public Concession informing them that the quarterly business license fees have been increased by 30% to 70%, effective from July 1st. At a time when commerce is depressed and the economy is exhausted, it is already extremely difficult to maintain the status quo. The authorities are not considering relief, but instead are suddenly increasing levies, which is deeply shocking. Citizens should have the obligation to pay taxes, but the authorities should have a certain standard and reason for collecting tax rates. How can they arbitrarily increase them without regard for business difficulties? What facts and reasons is the authority basing this increase on, and what is the principle for determining the increase? Is it based on business conditions, or on the number of rooms? If it is based on business conditions, the wounds of the Shanghai War are deep, the local vitality has not recovered, the social economy is bankrupt, and the disasters are frequent. Merchants are unable to travel, and all industries are withering. The hotel industry is the first to bear the brunt. Compare the current passenger turnover and business discounts with those before the Shanghai War, and you will see that business has been declining day by day. How can this be used as a basis for increasing taxes? As for basing it on the number of rooms, it is even more ignorant of the facts. Due to their business relationships, hoteliers sometimes increase or decrease the number of rooms (such as converting large rooms into small rooms). This is done to facilitate sales and cater to the abilities of passengers. In fact, the original buildings have not been expanded, and the rent in the lease contracts has not changed. This is one reason. The geographical range and the quality of decoration of hotels differ, so the room rates vary widely. The average daily room rate is not proportional to the number of rooms. This is the second reason. The above reasons were unanimously raised at the emergency meeting of the industry on the 15th of this month. It was decided to argue reasonably with the authorities and to pay the original tax amount on time until this case is fairly resolved. The authorities should accept this. The annual meeting of taxpayers had passed a resolution not to add any taxes temporarily. Why is the hotel industry suddenly being increased? It is difficult to approve this in this critical autumn. We respectfully ask your council to forward this letter to the Municipal Council requesting that it retract its decision to alleviate the difficulties of merchants. etc. In view of this, the facts about the decline of commercial numbers described by the association cannot be denied by anyone. Before January 28th of last year, the large hotels along Tibet Road released light from each room like daytime when the lights were lit, and they were full before 10 o'clock. Now, when you pass there, the lights are sparse, which shows a glimpse of their desolation. As for the small and medium-sized hotels where small and medium-sized merchants stay, at present, with the decline of the rural economy in the interior, business is even more depressed, so the number of people coming to Shanghai to purchase goods is very small. Therefore, the business of small and medium-sized hotels is also declining. The lack of public income cannot be ignored, but the mutual benefit of President Mai of the London World Economic Conference on June 12th is the key to profit (Mutualenrichmentistheconditionofindividualentichma). Therefore, the corresponding letter is sent to your bureau, please give it due consideration.</p>

<h3>The Yangtze River's Rising Waters Have Not Yet Ceased</h3>
<p>Yesterday it was Forty-Four Feet Two Inches</p>
<p>The Yangtze River region has experienced continuous rain, resulting in mountain torrents and flash floods. According to a report from the Yangtze River and Han River Engineering Bureau of the National Economic Council, yesterday (the 20th) at 9:00 AM, the water level at Hankou was forty-four feet two inches, an increase of one foot one inch compared to the previous day, equivalent to the highest water level of last year. It is predicted that the rising trend has not yet ceased. If it rises another four feet, the great flood of 1931 will be repeated. In anticipation of this, the council has dispatched the director of the engineering department, Xi Dejiong, to inspect various locations along the river and actively prepare for prevention. The news obtained from Shanghai is recorded below:</p>
<h3>The River Water is Rising Greatly</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the reporter visited Zhu Yong, the chief of the General Affairs Section of the National Economic Council, and inquired about preventive measures after the rise in the Yangtze River's water level. According to him, the Yangtze and Han Rivers' floodwaters have reached forty-four feet two inches, and the rising trend is predicted to continue unabated. If it rises another four feet to reach forty-eight feet or more, the river water will once again enter the city. The council has dispatched Xi Dejiong to conduct inspections and actively prepare for prevention, and has ordered the Yangtze River and Han River Engineering Bureau to intensify flood prevention work. A flood prevention plan has already been decided.</p>
<h3>Shen Tianxin's Eldest Son, Shen Mengyi, was Kidnapped Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Four Kidnappers Suddenly Staged a Kidnapping Case on Xin Zha Road｜Shortly After the Incident, the Kidnappers Telephoned to Arrange the Return of the Car｜Shen Tianxin is Known Among His Fellow Villagers to Have a Strong Exterior but Weak Interior!</p>
<p>At approximately 8:50 AM yesterday morning, a kidnapping case occurred in front of the Jianghaiguan Library on Xin Zha Road in West Shanghai. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Family Situation</h3>
<p>Shen Tianxin is a native of Huzhou, 52 years old, and works in the silk industry. He lives at No. 10, Lane 493 (i.e., Zizai Lane), Seymour Road. In 1927, Shen briefly served as a member of the Shanghai Political Affairs Council and the Superintendent of the Suzhou Customs Office, but he soon retired and continued to run his silk business, also opening the Choutai Hosiery Factory, the Dehe Silk Factory, and real estate businesses. However, due to the decline of the silk industry in recent years, Shen's financial situation is extremely strained. Shen has two sons and two daughters. The eldest son, Mengyi, is 25 years old and currently works in the foreign exchange department of the Bank of China on the Bund. He has been employed there for five years. The eldest daughter, Yiyao, is 23 years old and works at the Shanghai Customs Library on Xin Zha Road. Both assist Shen in managing the family's business.</p>
<h3>Brother and Sister in the Same Car</h3>
<p>Shen owns a car registered in the concession, license number 2085. Every morning, Mengyi and Yiyao take the car to work. The driver's name is Zhu Guangfeng. Yesterday morning, at approximately 8:30 AM, the brother and sister, as usual, had a quick breakfast and then left together in the car to go to their offices. The driver, Zhu Guangfeng, drove first to No. 1714 Xin Zha Road to drop off Yiyao at the Customs Library. Upon arriving at the library's entrance, Yiyao got out and went inside. The driver, Zhu Guangfeng, then began to turn the car around, intending to head towards the Bund and drop off Mengyi.</p>
<h3>Four Kidnappers</h3>
<p>Unexpectedly, at that moment, a man suddenly rushed out from the side of the street across the way. He was wearing a black silk long gown, pulled out a pistol, threatened the driver, Zhu Guangfeng, and ordered him to stop the car. The driver had no choice but to stop. At that moment, three more men jumped out from the side of the Customs Library, each also holding a pistol. They rushed towards the car, opened the door, and ordered the driver, Zhu Guangfeng, to get out. Zhu had no choice but to comply. The four kidnappers then quickly jumped into the car, with three of them holding Mengyi and ordering him to keep quiet. One of the kidnappers drove the car towards Jiaozhou Road. The driver, Zhu Guangfeng, seeing that his young master had been kidnapped, was extremely frightened. He quickly ran back into the Customs Library to report the incident to Yiyao.</p>
<h3>The Kidnappers' Phone Call</h3>
<p>Yiyao had just settled down, preparing to start work, when she heard this news. She was also thrown into disarray. After consulting with her colleagues, she quickly hired a car and rushed home to report to her father. She then reported the incident to the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station and requested assistance. The police station dispatched a large number of detectives to search the area around West Shanghai. At that moment, the Shen Tianxing family suddenly received a phone call. The other party only asked if it was the Shen family. When they answered in the affirmative, they heard the other party say that the car used in the kidnapping was now near Xieqiao, and they asked if they wanted it driven back. When asked who they were, they remained silent. The Shen family then reported this strange phone call to the police station. The police station notified the French police and dispatched detectives to investigate. They found the aforementioned car at the end of Luban Road, near the Xujiahui Road at Rihui Port. An overcoat was still in the car, which the Shen family identified as belonging to Mengyi. The detectives then searched the area around the car and brought the car and the overcoat back to the police station for safekeeping. They also notified various agencies in the city to assist in the pursuit. As of the time the reporter was filing this report, there was still no news.</p>
<h3>Strong Exterior, Weak Interior</h3>
<p>Although Shen is known for his enthusiasm for public welfare and often associates with prominent figures, his finances are very weak due to the recent decline in the silk industry. All of his real estate has already been mortgaged. Even the residence on Seymour Road is rented from a Mr. Li. The dilapidated car he uses is rented from a car owner surnamed Zhu. Recently, he has been sued in the Special District Court for being implicated as a guarantor. His situation of having a strong exterior but a weak interior is known to all of his fellow villagers from Huzhou. Therefore, those who heard that his son had been kidnapped were surprised.</p>
<p>The above planning and funding will be the responsibility of the Yangtze River and Han River Engineering Bureau, and the provision of materials and recruitment of laborers will be the responsibility of the local government. The preventive measures can ensure safety. Zhu also said that the Water Disaster Conference has been ordered to expedite the completion of some of its work, which will then be taken over by the National Economic Council.</p>
<h3>Water Level Comparison</h3>
<p>The reporter further inquired about the water levels this year compared to the great flood of the 20th year [of the Republic], and Mr. Zhu showed a detailed chart, from which the following is excerpted: (This Year's Water Level) (Last Year's Water Level)</p>
<p>May 5th: 20.60 30.60</p>
<p>May 15th: 22.80 30.60</p>
<p>May 25th: 33.00 36.00</p>
<p>June 5th: 38.20 38.20</p>
<p>June 15th: 41.10 39.50</p>
<p>June 25th: Not yet reached 44.20 36.00</p>
<p>(This Year) (Last Year)</p>
<p>May</p>
<p>Lowest: 20.60 Lowest: 27.00</p>
<p>Highest: 36.00 Highest: 37.50</p>
<p>June</p>
<p>Lowest: 36.00 Lowest: 37.50</p>
<p>Highest: 44.20 Highest: 39.50</p>
<p>Based on the table, during the great flood of the previous year, the high and low water levels in June differed by only two inches. This year, the difference is more than eight inches. This is a water phenomenon unseen in the last hundred years.</p>
<h3>Local Water Level</h3>
<p>Locally, the weather has also changed in recent days. Continuous rain overnight has led to water accumulation in low-lying areas. Yesterday morning, the reporter made inquiries with reliable sources regarding the local water level and its future predictions. The heights for this month are as follows:</p>
<p>20th: 9.14 feet</p>
<p>21st: 8.52 feet</p>
<p>22nd: 9.4 feet</p>
<p>23rd: 9.88 feet</p>
<p>24th: 10.28 feet</p>
<p>25th: 10.17 feet</p>
<p>26th: 10.3 feet</p>
<p>27th: 10.43 feet</p>
<p>28th: 11.22 feet</p>
<p>29th: 9.44 feet</p>
<p>30th: 8.72 feet</p>
<p>30th: 8.72 feet</p>
<p>The highest water level for next month is predicted to be on the 12th, at a height of 13.37 feet. (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Chen Baosheng, comprador of Xin Renhe, arrested.</p>
<h3>Court Reopens Debate</h3>
<p>So that all defendants can confront the comprador. The court sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau to bring in Chen Baosheng. The case of the Xin Renhe ship disaster, involving the deaths of five people, with defendants Sun Xingsheng, Guo Xihou, and 23 others, has been investigated and prosecuted by the District Court Prosecutor and repeatedly questioned by the Criminal Court. The debate concluded on the 4th, and a verdict was scheduled for the 22nd of this month. Because the assistant comprador Chen Baosheng has been arrested by the Detective Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau in Huaxingli, Zhabei, and is temporarily detained, and the newspaper has already announced it, the court, because the public prosecution has already concluded the debate, and the court testimonies of the defendants Sun Xingsheng and Guo Xihou at the time all pushed responsibility onto Chen Baosheng, and claimed Chen Baosheng was the comprador, with all the authority, and during Chen's escape, naturally there was no way to get to the bottom of it. Now that he has been arrested, it is urgent to renew the trial and reopen the debate so that all defendants have the opportunity to confront Chen Baosheng. This is a key point in sentencing, so first inquire about the circumstances of the arrest and send a letter to the Public Security Bureau to bring Chen Baosheng to court to be dealt with according to the law.</p>
<h3>Tragic Car Accident Due to Negligence</h3>
<p>A driver, "Dwarf Beard," burned to death on the spot. Another driver and apprentice injured. Dwarf Beard's smoking is the cause.</p>
<p>The Meimei Auto Company, located at numbers 3 to 5, at the corner of Dixiwei Road and Fengtian Road, is Japanese-owned and equipped with three black-plated rental cars. All three drivers are also Japanese, with only one Chinese apprentice specifically for operation. The company also stores over twenty boxes of gasoline from a certain Japanese firm for wholesale. One of the drivers, named Dwarf Beard, is about thirty years old. Because he dislikes the heat, he often sleeps in the car. The night before last, Dwarf Beard was sleeping in the car as usual, but woke up around 4 a.m. yesterday. Unable to fall back asleep, he sat up and smoked. Inadvertently, a spark of fire was blown by the wind into the gasoline tank in the car's engine. Instantly, there was a loud explosion, and sparks flew onto the twenty or so boxes of gasoline beside it, igniting them immediately. In an instant, thick smoke filled the air and flames blazed. The other two drivers and an apprentice sleeping upstairs were awakened from their dreams. Seeing that the building was about to be engulfed, they hurriedly jumped out of the front window, causing the apprentice and one driver to be injured in the fall. Before long, the Shenjiawan Fire Brigade received the news and quickly dispatched fire trucks to the scene to extinguish the fire. By 4:30 a.m., the fire was finally put out. The injured driver and apprentice were sent to Fumin Hospital for treatment, and their injuries are reportedly very serious. The driver Dwarf Beard was burned to death on the spot. All three black-plated cars were also destroyed in the fire, resulting in significant losses.</p>
<p>Car company fined for stamp tax.</p>
<h3>Request to Revoke the Punishment</h3>
<p>A first for the establishment of the First Special Court. Two appeals by car companies rejected. On February 27th of this year, inspectors Liang Shisheng and Ling Yincong from the Shanghai Special District Stamp Tax Office discovered thousands of unstamped signature papers at seven car companies: Xiang Sheng Auto Company, Li Li Car Company, Xin Zha Auto Company, Mei Hua Auto Company, Xing Long Auto Company, Yi Tai Auto Company, and China Auto Company. On March 8th, the Legal Department of the Municipal Council filed a public lawsuit against the managers of the above seven car companies. After trial by Judge Shen Shanzeng, Xiang Sheng and Li Li were each fined 1,000 yuan, Mei Hua was fined 1,040 yuan, China was fined 800 yuan, Yi Tai was fined 530 yuan, Xing Long was fined 410 yuan, and Xin Zha was fined 300 yuan. Except for Li Li, which paid the fine, the other six companies, including Xiang Sheng, appealed after the verdict because the Temporary Rules for Stamp Tax do not allow for appeals, resulting in a rejection. They then filed a second appeal, which was also rejected. The car companies then appealed to the Ministry of Justice and other agencies, detailing the circumstances and requesting relief. On the 10th of this month, the Ministry of Justice issued an instruction stating, "Upon investigation, the rejection of the appeal in this case is appropriate. If the original fine is indeed illegal, a request to revoke the punishment can be made to the Shanghai First Special District District Court." Upon receiving the instruction, Xiang Sheng and other car companies hired attorney Cheng Shang to submit a petition to the First Special Court, requesting the revocation of the original punishment. The petition detailed the original trial's failure to adopt the defendant's testimony and the failure to deliver the punishment notice, among other issues.</p>
<p>Therefore, yesterday afternoon, the First Special Court issued summons to the owners of the car companies, Zhou Xiangsheng, Fang Yuefang, Jing Jinsheng, Zhou Peifu, Guo Shiliang, and Gu Deguang, and Judge Wu Xiangzu conducted the trial in the Fifth Criminal Court. Attorney Zhang of the police represented the police. Judge Wu stated that the purpose of today's hearing is to examine whether there is reason to revoke the original punishment. He then questioned Zhou Xiangsheng. According to Zhou, the signature papers were prepared in accordance with Article 16 of the Municipal Council's regulations because of the convenience of police inspection and are not for collecting payments. If payments are collected, receipts are issued and stamped according to regulations. The signature papers only calculate the time to prevent customers from being cheated by drivers. According to Directive No. 86 of the Special District Stamp Tax Office, signature papers should be exempt from stamp tax. Now, this court imposed a heavy fine for unstamped signature papers, which is unfair, and therefore requests the revocation of the original judgment. Attorney Zhang, representing the police, then stated that signature papers are originally a type of rental item and should be stamped in accordance with Article 2 of the Stamp Tax Regulations, so the original judgment was appropriate. Judge Wu then questioned Fang Yuefang and others, who all stated that their reasons were the same as those stated by Zhou Xiangsheng. Judge Wu then announced an adjournment for further investigation. It is noted that this type of request is a novel idea since the establishment of the First Special Court.</p>
<p>Verbal dispute over car sales.</p>
<h3>American Woman Kills Englishman</h3>
<p>American guilty of manslaughter, sentenced to two years. Marrying in prison, both arranged by the American Consul. According to the "Da Mei Evening News," American Hargrave, due to a verbal and physical altercation over the sale of a car with Englishman Parnell, who fell to the ground and suffered severe injuries, subsequently dying, was tried today (20th) by American Consul Pandy without a jury. After the prosecutor and defendant presented their cases, Hargrave was sentenced to two years of imprisonment for manslaughter. The defendant's lawyer requested probation, stating that the defendant was willing to provide one-third of his salary and commissions to support the deceased's family for five years. The judge denied the request, citing that the defendant had previously caused trouble with his fists twice, as a warning for the future. According to the testimony, the cause of the altercation was that Hargrave and Parnell were both car salesmen. Hargrave was trying to sell a car to a Shanghai woman when Parnell interfered and disparaged his car in front of her. Later, the two met on the Bund outside of Wuma Road while each were in cars and engaged in a verbal dispute. Hargrave suddenly punched Parnell, who fell to the ground, causing a concussion and bleeding from the back of his head, and died shortly after in the hospital. Hargrave previously served in the U.S. Marine Corps in Shanghai. After his discharge, he returned to Shanghai. He got married last year, with Consul Pandy officiating the wedding. Today, Consul Pandy is again escorting him to prison, a coincidence that can be described as unfortunate.</p>
<h3>Zhao Yuntao Privately Manufactures Counterfeit Lead Coins</h3>
<p>Entrusted Yanziwo to sell for profit. Examination of all defendants has concluded. Lu Jinquan, Zhou Ruiyuan, Hua Kunshi, and other detectives from the Central Police Station of the French Concession, recently learned that Jiaxing native Zhao Yuntao was privately manufacturing counterfeit large and small coins out of lead at 408 Malan Road, 3rd floor, and entrusting Gu Sanlang, a Chongming native who operated the Yanziwo at 75 Laoshenfu Road, to sell them for profit, violating the prohibition. On the 4th of this month, they went to the addresses one after the other and arrested Zhao and Gu, along with eight other related people: Pan Jinwen, Qian Xiaorong, Chen Yaoming, Xia Miaoqi, Fang Jinwen, and the woman Pan Meichun. At Zhao's residence, they confiscated 58 yuan of counterfeit coins, 247 counterfeit "double corner" coins, seven large and small molds, and manufacturing chemicals and tools. At Gu's residence, they confiscated smoking paraphernalia, etc. They were escorted to the Second Special District District Court, and the police lawyer charged them under Article 212 of the Criminal Code for counterfeiting currency and under Articles 10 and 11 of the Anti-Smoking Law for operating a smoking den and smoking opium and red pills. The case has been investigated and prosecuted. Yesterday morning, Judge Li Changnian heard the case in the First Criminal Court. First, the police lawyer Gu Shouxi explained the case and the police's investigation. Then, detective Zhou Ruiyuan reported the circumstances of the defendants' arrest. Zhao Yuntao testified that he was actually privately manufacturing coins in a rented house by a man named Xiao Guisheng, who is currently at large, and that Fang Jinwen was also helping with the manufacturing. "I can't do it, I'm just helping out. The big ones are made at ten or more yuan a day, and the small ones at forty or fifty 'jiao'." Gu Sanlang testified, "I only run a smoking den. I used to handle counterfeit coins, but I don't dare to do it anymore. I don't know Zhao Yuntao or Xiao Guisheng." Qian Xiaorong testified, "I sell fruit. I bought a 'double corner' for 1 yuan and 15 'fen' from Gu Sanlang, but I couldn't use it, so I went back to return it and was arrested." Chen Yaoming admitted to buying two 'double corner' coins for 240 'wen'. Pan and Xia testified that they were arrested while smoking at Gu's place and knew nothing about the counterfeit coins. Fang Jinwen testified, "I came out to look for business on the Dragon Boat Festival and met Xiao Guisheng. He told me to live with him for only six days. Xiao Guisheng and Zhao Yuntao lived together. They made it at night, I don't know." The woman Pan Meichun testified, "I'm sixteen years old and live at 6 Xieshengli, Malan Road. Zhao Yuntao and Xiao Guisheng came over to get to know each other. Xiao Guisheng had me deliver paper packages to Gu Sanlang's place three or four times, but they didn't give me any money." After the questioning, the judge ordered the start of the debate. After mutual debate between the police lawyer and the court-appointed lawyer Zhu Taiqing, the court announced the conclusion of the debate and scheduled the sentencing for the 27th. The defendants were returned to custody to await instructions.</p>

<h3>Zhang Wenda Drowns Himself in the Sea Out of Anger Towards Japan</h3>
<p>His suicide note expresses regret for not killing the enemy, and his family boards a ship to seek his soul by the sea. Zhang Wenda, a native of Jiading, is 22 years old and works as a clerk at the Huachang Can Factory in Shanghai. He is straightforward and concerned about national affairs. During the January 28th Incident last year, he witnessed the violent actions of the Japanese and felt extreme hatred in his heart. Later, witnessing the loss of the Northeast, he considered quitting his job last year to go to the Northeast and join the Volunteer Army to fight the enemy to the death, but he was unable to. This year, after seeing news about the Northeast in the newspapers, he was angered by the precarious state of the country and felt powerless to save it, so he decided to end his life. At the end of last month, he boarded the Xin Jiangtian ship of the Shanghai-Ningbo line from Shanghai. When the ship arrived at the Zhenhai port, the sky was just beginning to lighten. Zhang jumped into the sea to kill himself. When the sailors realized this, they stopped the ship to save him, but the waves were rough and the sky was still dark. They only saw a dark shadow being swept away by the waves, disappearing in an instant. Later, a suicide note was found in his room, which the steward delivered to his parents a few days ago. The suicide note stated, "Father and Mother, your unfilial son has died. You do not need to be sad. If I had gone to Jinan and directly to the Northeast last year and killed a few enemies before dying, then I would be able to face the country and my parents after death." After reading the letter, Zhang's parents were extremely saddened and came to Shanghai yesterday to take a ship to Zhenhai to search for their son's body and seek his soul by the sea.</p>

<h3>Official Letter Regarding the Legal Merger of Exchanges</h3>
<p>Official letter from the Shanghai Exchange Supervisor to various exchanges (Li Zi No. 73, May 31, 22nd year) states:</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of Shanghai Huashang Securities Exchange and Shanghai Securities and Goods Exchange Securities Department's merger, previously, Article 55 of the Exchange Law only stipulated a merger within three years, without detailing the specifics of the merger nor establishing clear general principles. Therefore, there was a lack of legal basis for handling the merger. On December 12, 21st year, a confidential report was submitted to the Executive Yuan to request interpretation. Now, Executive Yuan Order No. 2192 states: Regarding the Ministry's report requesting the forwarding of the interpretation of Article 55 of the Exchange Law to the Judicial Yuan, which was submitted to the Executive Yuan, the Executive Yuan transferred it for interpretation and instructed notification. The Judicial Yuan's Zi No. 884 states: Upon review and deliberation by the Yuan's Unified Interpretation of Laws and Regulations Conference, the merged exchanges under Article 55, paragraph 1 of the Exchange Law are limited to those that comply with Article 1 of the same law and the circumstances of Article 147 of the Company Law, as clearly stipulated in Article 37 of the Implementing Rules of the same law. Regarding the merger, it should be handled in accordance. Accordingly, the response is sent to your Yuan for your information and instruction. This order is hereby issued to the relevant departments to be notified and to abide by this order. By the end of May, the three-year deadline has expired. All exchanges in Shanghai that fall under Article 55 of the Exchange Law should be urged to merge in accordance with the law. Please comply. This letter is hereby issued for your information.</p>
<h3>Gaoqiao Seaside Hotel Digging Soil Damages Embankment</h3>
<p>Zhao Yigong telegraphs the Municipal Government to stop it!</p>
<p>The Gaoqiao Seaside Hotel, in an attempt to make huge profits by operating a seawater bathing beach, is excavating soil along the eastern embankment to fill its foundation. This is a serious matter for the embankment. Zhao Yigong, a resident of the area, telegraphed the Municipal Government yesterday, requesting them to stop it.</p>
<h3>Murderer Ji Yutao Sentenced</h3>
<p>Ji Yutao, a native of Yangzhou who used to operate a bicycle shop in Shunxinli, Yangshupu, had a dispute with Zhou Dianchen, a native of Xuzhou, over the rental of bicycles in August of last year. He then gathered a gang and stabbed Zhou in vital areas with sharp knives, causing his immediate death. After the crime, he fled and disappeared without a trace. The police issued an arrest warrant, but he remained at large for almost a year, with no clues to be found. It was not until the 3rd of this month that Chief Detective Shao Jingfan of the General Police Department's Investigation Division learned that Ji Yutao was hiding near Quanshan, Wuxi. Detective Shao secretly went to Wuxi and, together with detectives from the local garrison command, arrested Ji at his address and brought him to Shanghai, where he was escorted to the First Special District District Court. After repeated court hearings and investigations, the sentencing date was set for yesterday morning. Judge Wu Zehan ascended the bench in the Third Criminal Court and announced the judgment, sentencing the defendant Ji Yutao to five years of imprisonment. The number of days spent in pre-trial detention will be credited at a rate of two days for each day of imprisonment.</p>
<h3>Change of Plan for the Puhuitang River Project</h3>
<p>The Post-War Relief Commission Halts Funding</p>
<p>The Puhuitang River in West Shanghai has been silted up for a long time. After Mr. Ma Xiangbo and others initiated dredging, the Municipal Government ordered the Public Works Bureau to contract out the work in sections. The cost was to be covered by the Songhu War Zone Post-War Relief Commission, which allocated 130,000 yuan (of which 30,000 yuan was designated for the area east of Jiji Bridge), which was insufficient. Additional funds were to be collected from farmland in the Pujiang, Songjiang, and Caojing districts along the river, totaling 45,000 yuan, as previously reported. However, the eastern half of the sixth section (from the archway eastward to Jiji Bridge) is located at the intersection of the Chinese and French areas, so the Municipal Government and the French Municipal Council each subsidized 12,500 taels of silver, and private donations were made, including 6,500 yuan from Huang Jinrong, 4,000 yuan from the Dahua Calcium Factory, and 400 yuan from the Rixin Silk Factory, totaling 220,000 yuan. Now, the Municipal Public Works Bureau has changed its plans and stopped dredging the eastern half of the sixth section. It also plans to permanently fill in over fifty zhang (approximately 167 meters) of the river surface (occupying approximately ten mu of land) at the Chinese-French border in Xujiahui Town, to be sold by the Municipal Government for the construction of municipal housing. A road would then be built behind it, connecting to Xuxie Road. Merchants and residents throughout Xujiahui Town believe that the river section is important for navigation, and that the blocked ends of this black water section will prevent flow, causing a foul odor that is nauseating. They have jointly petitioned the Municipal Government to quickly dredge the river, but have not received a response. It has now been learned that the Post-War Relief Commission, because the Public Works Bureau has delayed the dredging in accordance with the original plan, causing losses to both merchants and farmers, has decided to withhold the remaining 40,000 yuan, in addition to the 90,000 yuan already paid, and transfer it to other relief projects.</p>

<h3>Report of the Shaanxi Disaster Relief Commissioner of the Red Swastika Society</h3>
<p>Relief Efforts in Eight Heavily Affected Counties</p>
<p>The Red Swastika Society previously dispatched presidents Li Zhizhen and Wang Zhengui to Shaanxi to provide relief due to the severity of the disaster situation. They have now completed their task. The Shanghai General Office of the Society received a detailed report yesterday from Li and Wang regarding the use of the relief funds. Excerpts are recorded as follows: During this trip to Shaanxi for disaster relief, Presidents Li and Wang received a total of 32,150 yuan, including 20,000 yuan remitted by the General Society, 12,000 yuan remitted by your office, and 150 yuan in exchange rate adjustments. This lasted for two months. A total of 25,693 yuan in relief funds were distributed in the eight counties with the most severe disaster situations: Wugong, Fufeng, Qianxian, Xingping, Liquan, Qishan, Zhouzhi, and Xingping. Regarding the adoption of male and female disaster orphans, the society entrusted the Xi'an branch to establish a female disaster orphan education and care home, and entrusted the Liquan branch to establish a male disaster orphan education and care home. Each home received a donation of 1,500 yuan. An additional 6,420 yuan was used to subsidize 14 disaster orphan education and care homes, including the Xi'an branch. The total expenditure was 33,113 yuan. A detailed statement of income and expenses is attached (omitted). However, the disaster situation in the province is extremely dire, and a few tens of thousands of yuan are merely a drop in the bucket and cannot solve the problem. It is hoped that colleagues in our society will continue their efforts to provide relief, and that people at home and abroad will generously donate large sums of money so that those disaster victims on the verge of death can regain a stable life as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Joint Meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees of the Hongshun Mutual Aid Society</h3>

<h3>Miscellaneous News</h3>
<p>Grand Bear Industrial Art and Health Society Exhibition. The Grand Bear Industrial Art and Health Society is organized by a number of artists and health experts in the country. Its purpose is to make art and health practical and to industrialize art and health. It is the first step in the movement of artists and health experts "going to the people." The society is holding an Industrial Art History Exhibition at the China National Goods Company on the second floor of the Continental Shopping Mall, starting yesterday (the 20th). The works on display are all kinds of advertising patterns. The development of modern European and American industry and commerce is due to the importance of advertising, and the reason why foreign goods can sell well in our country's market is also because their advertisements are eye-catching and attract customers. The society, in view of this, has spent several months of effort to draw hundreds of kinds of advertising patterns. On the one hand, it aims to promote the movement to promote domestic goods, and on the other hand, it aims to educate the general public about artistic concepts. This work is the first of its kind in the country, so there are many places in advertising art that need to be borrowed from European and American advertising. Therefore, the society's exhibition also includes a variety of advertising paintings commissioned by foreign commercial firms in this city, so that viewers can make an artistic comparison between this and existing domestic advertisements. The intention is certainly not to promote foreign goods. Yesterday was the first day of the exhibition and there were many visitors. It is heard that the exhibition will only last for three days, so those who care about advertising should visit as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Robbers Sentenced Separately</h3>
<p>The Zifeng Tobacco and Paper Store opened by Chai Zhixiang at 235 Rue Cardinal Mercier in the French Concession and the home of Zhu Xinquan, an antique dealer at 135 Lane Kim-shan in Route Gustare, were successively broken into and robbed of cash, jewelry, and gold and jade ornaments worth about 7,000 yuan last month. The special agency of the French police station, led by Detective Cui Zhenguo, arrested the robbers Chen Acai, Zhang Jinsheng, Zhang Jipin, Liu Xitang, Qian Genfa, Wang Yulin, and Chen Xiaobao, as well as suspects Wang Azhang, Guan Hesheng, Wang Shansheng, and Shen Weizhou, in the Chinese territories of Nanshi and Zhabei. Three stolen diamond rings and gold and jade ornaments were recovered and brought into the police station.

They were released not long ago and committed robbery again. They were escorted to the Second Special District District Court, and the police station's lawyer filed a public prosecution in accordance with the criminal law for gang robbery and recidivism. The interrogation has now concluded. The four suspects, Wang Azhang, Guan Hesheng, Wang Shansheng, and Shen Weizhou, were released first after being found to be unrelated.

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>Having read the Da Fang Company's statement in your esteemed newspaper yesterday, it is truly a deliberate attempt to distort the facts and mislead the public. Whether the company should increase rents during this time of national crisis is a matter for legal resolution, which I will not discuss here. As for the Da Fang Li houses, they were completed at the end of October in the 18th year of the Republic of China (as evidenced by the work unit donation register and electricity deposit slips), which is only a little over three years ago. The company claims that it has been five years, which is the first inaccuracy. After the company issued the rent increase notice, the tenants unanimously opposed it. The company then filed lawsuits against one or two tenants who were vulnerable, which is a completely threatening behavior. Now, they are referring to those resisting with legal claims as "bad elements" who are advertising against them and trying to undermine the process by reversing the order of events. This is the second inaccuracy. In short, the landlord only cares about money and will use any means, no matter how destructive, to achieve their insatiable desires. Fearing that readers would be misled, I have written this special letter to correct the record and clarify the truth. Please publish it in the "Letters to the Editor" column to distinguish right from wrong. Your kindness will be deeply appreciated. This letter is respectfully addressed to the editor of the Shen Bao. Respectfully, the United Temporary Office of the Tenants of Da Fang Li on South Chengdu Road, June 19th.</p>

<p>Special Report</p>
<h3>『Synopsis of the "Shen Bao Series: The Soviet Union's Second Five-Year Plan"』</h3>
<p>Compiled by Ms. Fan Ying, total 68 pages</p>
<p>Paperback, 32mo. Price: 25 cents. The Soviet Union's First Five-Year Plan, which shook the world, was completed in four years and three months at the end of 1932. Now, the Second Five-Year Plan has begun on January 1st of this year. Many books in China have introduced the First Five-Year Plan. The results of the First Five-Year Plan tell us about the astonishing achievements of Soviet social construction, the rapid increase in numbers, and the complete victory of socialism. What kind of significant meaning does the Second Five-Year Plan contain? What stage will it take the Soviet Union to next? What is the content of the plan? These are all things we are eager to know now. The purpose of this book is to provide a faithful introduction to the Soviet Union's Second Five-Year Plan to meet this need. This book was compiled by Ms. Fan Ying. The entire book is divided into twelve sections. First, the introduction briefly describes the economic development of the Soviet Union since the November Revolution in 1917 and the significance of the Second Five-Year Plan in Soviet economic construction. "The characteristic of the Second Five-Year Plan is the realization of a socialist society and the attempt to achieve complete economic independence from capitalism." Second, it reviews the actual achievements of the First Five-Year Plan, explains the impact of the completion of the First Five-Year Plan on the Soviet economic structure, and the relationship between the Second Five-Year Plan and the First Five-Year Plan. The impact of the success of the First Five-Year Plan on the Soviet economic structure is: first, the foundation of a socialist economic system; second, the transformation of the Soviet Union from an agricultural country to an industrial country; and third, the transformation of Soviet agriculture from small-scale to the largest scale in the world. In addition, the success of the First Five-Year Plan fully proves that socialism has triumphed over capitalism and further illustrates the decline of world capitalism, while the productive enterprises under socialism are prospering. These are all things we should review regarding the First Five-Year Plan before studying the Second Five-Year Plan. Only with a correct grasp of the above-mentioned changes can we have a full understanding of the content and political significance of the Second Five-Year Plan. This point is explained in detail in the book. Fifth, it continues to describe the basic tasks of the Second Five-Year Plan, first describing the process of compiling the Second Five-Year Plan, and then its central political task. What is the central political task of the Second Five-Year Plan? "It is the final elimination of capitalist elements and general classes, the complete eradication of the causes of class distinctions and exploitation, and the overcoming of the remnants of capitalism in the consciousness of people in the economy, transforming all working people into conscious and active builders of a proletarian socialist society." "In other words, the task of establishing the socialist economic foundation was solved by the First Five-Year Plan. The task of the Second Five-Year Plan is to build a socialist society in the Soviet Union." Then it describes the central economic task of the Second Five-Year Plan, which is "to complete the transformation of the entire national economy and to establish the most modern technological foundation for all sectors of the national economy." Then it describes the social tasks. Furthermore, it describes the development of chemistry and industry in the Second Five-Year Plan. Fifth, it describes the agricultural outline of the Second Five-Year Plan. The main tasks of the Second Five-Year Plan regarding agriculture are to determine the socialist transformation, basically complete agricultural mechanization, increase yields, and prevent early famines. Its content includes: (1) completing collectivization, (2) agricultural mechanization, (3) increasing yields, (4) preventing droughts, (5) developing animal husbandry, (6) promoting new agricultural production technologies, etc. This section provides detailed explanations of all of these. Sixth, it describes the outline of the transportation industry in the Second Five-Year Plan, divided into five items: railways, waterways, automobile transportation, aviation, and telecommunications. From this, we can see the large-scale development of the transportation industry in the Second Five-Year Plan. Seventh, it describes commerce in the Second Five-Year Plan. Regarding commerce, on the one hand, (1) develop state-owned commerce and exclude private management, and on the other hand, (2) expand the cooperative network, and (3) develop foreign trade. These are explained item by item in this section. Eighth, it describes the regional allocation of productive forces in the Second Five-Year Plan, focusing on the balanced development of each region and the organized integration of production, which is completely different from the anarchic state of production in capitalist countries. Ninth, it describes technology and science in the Second Five-Year Plan, pointing out the Soviet Union's emphasis on technical talents and the recent increase in technical talents. Tenth, it describes the welfare level of workers and peasants in the Second Five-Year Plan. In the Five-Year Plan, the material life of the general workers and peasants will be greatly improved, and their cultural level will be particularly improved, such as the complete elimination of illiteracy, the large-scale expansion of publishing, libraries, and film industries, all of which will be implemented within five years. The following eleventh and twelfth sections then describe the lineup for the start of the Second Five-Year Plan and the prospects of the Second Five-Year Plan and the capitalist world. From here, we can see the true spirit of Soviet construction and its strict discipline, such as strict party cleansing, eradication of vagrant elements, rectification of labor discipline, and thorough elimination of bureaucracy, all of which are strict rectifications of all aspects before starting the execution of the plan. This is indeed a thin booklet, but the description is extremely detailed and especially interesting. The entire book has 68 pages, with eight copperplate illustrations attached at the beginning.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>A Poet's Lucky Encounter: Commemorating the 16th-Century Camões</h3>
<p>— Bai</p>
<p>Bai Juyi, in his letter to Yuan Zhen, said the line "People of the time are often unlucky." Ouyang Xiu then expanded this sentence from four characters to seven characters, calling it "Poets are seldom successful and often poor." After Bai and Ouyang said this, poets were jinxed and have remained in a slump ever since.</p>
<p>Not only are they in a slump, but poets can also stand tall like bronze statues in parks. Poets can also continue to shine brightly after four hundred years. Poets can also be celebrated in grand commemorative ceremonies with twenty-one-gun salutes. How can anyone say "Poets are often unlucky"? How can anyone say "Poets are seldom successful and often poor"?</p>
<p>Who is this poet? It is the Camões. Readers, please note. This Camões is not the poet Jia Dao of the Tang Dynasty. It was said that "Jia Dao was cold and emaciated." Jia Dao was in a slump during his lifetime, and he has remained in a slump after his death. Not to mention that no one commemorates him, even if there is a commemoration, it would only be "Respectfully offering clear wine as a sacrifice to Mr. Jia Langxian, the poet of the Great Tang." No matter how great the reputation of a Chinese poet may be, there is definitely no bronze statue or twenty-one-gun salute for them. The Camões I am talking about is of course not a domestic poet, but an imported one.</p>
<p>Macau was originally the land of Guangdong, also known as Haojingao. In the 36th year of the Jiajing reign of the Ming Dynasty, the Portuguese came to live here, paying an annual rent of 515 taels of silver. This was the beginning of foreigners establishing concessions in China. Although Chinese and foreigners lived together, the Chinese government still had considerable sovereignty. During the Qianlong reign, there were still county magistrates, deputy generals, and commanding officers stationed there. It was not until the Guangxu reign that the government fawned on foreigners and explicitly allowed the Portuguese to have permanent administrative rights. Thus, the "vine was cut off." It was not leased to the Portuguese, but given to them.</p>
<p>Camões was a great poet of Portugal. Around 1556 AD, he came to Macau and lived in a stone cave. He created magnificent epic poems to express his patriotic zeal. After he came to Macau, the Portuguese followed one after another and even obtained Macau as a place of residence from the Yan Song government. He is called a poet, but in reality, he was an explorer, combining Du Fu and Columbus into one person. No wonder the Portuguese held such a grand commemorative ceremony on June 10th of this year.</p>
<p>A foreign poet has such incredible magic. How many Chinese compatriots are overseas as expatriates? If they want to have such glory, they can forget about it. It is already fortunate if they are not expelled. At the time when the Portuguese were enthusiastically commemorating Camões, the overseas Chinese in Mexico had their property confiscated one by one, crying bitterly as they returned to their homeland. Alas! "Comparing people makes one angry."</p>
<h3>Two Dollars and Forty Cents</h3>
<p>— Ke Ding'an</p>
<p>Unemployed men and women fill the Shanghai market. Even on the bustling and noisy streets, there are still men wearing neat suits and women wearing fashionable clothes. Who knows that they may be harboring the sorrow of unemployment? Such a thing is not false, and there are facts to prove it.</p>
<p>Here is a common example: If XX Commercial Company or School wants to hire a staff member or teacher, they only need to place a seven- or eight-line advertisement in the local supplement of the newspaper, and many people will apply. If the advertisement says "regardless of gender," then many women will also come. Although it is clear that they only need one person, many people still apply. This is because each person calculates based on themselves as a unit. They do not think that there are others who are applying just like them.</p>
<p>As a result, of course, most people are unemployed and disappointed. The rare lucky ones can be selected, but their living expenses will definitely disappoint them. The saying "too many monks and not enough porridge" seems very appropriate in modern times! In the past, it only applied to the unemployment of general men, but now that men and women have equal rights, this unemployment trend will also fall on women. This is truly a major change in the times!</p>
<p>If a large company needs two or three female staff members, it only costs two dollars and forty cents to place an advertisement in the classified section of the local supplement of the newspaper, and there will be a "gathering of talents" with "instant response." However, a friend has a different view. He said, "If a large company is looking for two or three female staff members, at least fifty or sixty people will apply. Can it be that only two or three of the fifty or sixty people are qualified? I don't believe it!" I think that's very true. Large companies also have a hard time. If they are looking for two or three people, it is best to limit the number of applicants so as to avoid unnecessarily increasing the number of disappointed people. This is also an important issue in society.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>— Xianxian</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese thirty or forty years ago were very prominent. Although they suffered from poverty in their home country, worrying about the next meal after finishing the current one, they only needed to get rich once by colluding with "smugglers" and hiding in the coal bunkers of large ships. Once they arrived in a foreign country smoothly, they could show off. Although "Chinamen" in foreign countries were engaged in jobs such as laundry workers, cooks, and street vendors, or even as "houseboys" and "coolies," ultimately, "shillings," "francs," "marks," and "gold yuan" were more valuable than the old "seven mace and three candareens." Therefore, after drifting in foreign countries for ten or eight years, they returned home in glory, with their pockets full of "money." At that time, all countries needed "Chinese laborers" because "Chinese laborers" had the "strength" passed down from their parents and were willing to work like cattle and horses for lower wages. "Cheap and good" was not only "renowned at home and abroad" but was simply "universally praised." Therefore, they were welcomed and praised by foreigners. Since the price of gold soared and all countries had overproduction, causing a "recession," the "unemployment problem" became more and more serious every day. Thus, the "crusts of bread" and "bread crumbs" that the overseas Chinese gnawed on were actually coveted by "gentlemen" who once disdained them, lowering themselves to crave them. Therefore, "you exclude the Chinese," and "I exclude the Chinese," expelling large batches of "cheap and good" overseas Chinese and snatching away the "crusts of bread" and "bread crumbs" that the overseas Chinese were gnawing on.</p>
<p>It is already pitiful enough that overseas Chinese drifting overseas are "not treated well," but the consular officials only know how to collect taxes and levies, and even collude with local governments to oppress them, imposing all kinds of taxes. Therefore, every time I see overseas Chinese with "money" in their pockets "returning home in glory," I often feel "joy and sorrow." But recently, seeing the compatriots forced to return home looking panicked like homeless dogs, "where does the joy come from?" There is only "sorrow from within."</p>
<p>Unable to eat "rice" or gnaw on "bread crumbs" in their motherland, overseas Chinese are Chinese people and are also ill-fated.</p>
<h3>Shoes</h3>
<p>— Jingxi</p>
<p>When I was a child, I was extremely happy to receive a pair of red silk embroidered shoes from my aunt or grandmother. But I had to wait for a wedding opportunity to wear them, so I couldn't help but feel a little sad unless children were forgetful.</p>
<p>Shoes, like clothes, change with the fashion. One moment they are pointed, the next they are round; from shallow to deep, from narrow to wide, they keep going back to the old patterns. Since running shoes became popular, everyone wears a pair, supposedly without distinction between rich and poor, so they are called equality shoes. However, it is difficult to break the class system between rich and poor. The "tycoons" who sit in cars and chartered cars must wear black satin shoes with white soles, striding arrogantly. Fashionable men and women must also wear leather shoes that make a tapping sound. And the coolies and rickshaw pullers still tie on pairs of straw sandals with exposed blue veins in order to sell their "strength" for work.</p>
<p>The three-inch golden lotuses that used to "bring spring with every step" when helping young women across the bridge have been transformed into high-heeled leather shoes that "make noise with every step" when holding a lover's arm. The former was said to express morbid beauty, and people exclaimed: "Ugly! Ugly!" The latter is said to express healthy beauty, and people exclaim: "Beautiful! Beautiful!"</p>
<p>Students of female physical education teachers like to wear basketball shoes, paired with strong legs and short skirts tied high, running with extraordinary agility. As a result, young men drool with desire; older women cannot keep up; and old men shake their heads and say: "They are all disasters!" Every morning around six or seven o'clock, many young people wearing sneakers and carrying large basketballs come to the sports field. Probably Xiao Liu Zi, who sells sugar sesame balls at the door, is also a little envious. He also put on a pair of old basketball shoes the day before yesterday. Once, an American engineer asked me, "Do people in your country like basketball so much?" I was speechless for a moment. Indeed, how come there are so many people wearing basketball shoes in the trams, parks, and on the streets!</p>
<p>Long Novel</p>
<h3>The Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 9: Words cannot be directed. The son-in-law secretly leads. The unexpected is well-founded. The tutor leisurely waits.</p>
<p>Old man Zhao was smoking his dry tobacco pipe and just kept looking at Zhao Ziqiang. He had nothing to say, and touched his face and then his head. Old man Zhao said, "Why don't you say anything?" Zhao Ziqiang said, "Company Commander Guan and they are relatives. After all, he must know what their family thinks. I think it's better to ask him clearly before saying anything." Old man Zhao said, "You see him every day in the camp. Haven't you mentioned this matter to him?" Zhao Ziqiang laughed and said, "He won't do. I'm thinking of going to the city to ask Company Commander Guan's wife. She is a quick-tongued person and will definitely tell me about any difficulties." Old man Zhao listened to him say this and kept stroking his beard. He was thinking in his heart that this child must be going to ask Company Commander Guan's wife. Maybe there is some relationship in this. So he nodded and said, "That's good. You can go then. Do you have time to go today?" Zhao Ziqiang said, "I do have time today." After Old man Zhao heard this, he nodded again and said very gently, "Okay then, you can go." He replied like that with an attitude of having no other choice. Company Commander Zhao heard that he really didn't hesitate any longer. He immediately packed up at home and headed to the city. When he arrived in the city, he didn't go to see Guan Da's wife. Instead, he remembered the address that Gan Jizhi had told him that day and went to the guild hall to find him. After turning many alleys, he finally found this guild hall. When he arrived at the door, he asked the janitor and gave him a business card, saying that he wanted to meet a Gan Erye who had just moved into the guild hall. Originally, there was no need for so much formality to meet guests at the guild hall. Since he was so considerate, who knows what kind of relationship he had with Gan Erye. The janitor had no choice but to take the business card to Gan Jizhi's room. Jizhi's thoughts had changed greatly during this time, and he had bought many books on new ideas to read. At this time, he was putting a half-old book on materialistic history on the table and taking a red pencil to circle each sentence he read. The janitor came in and asked him, "Mr. Gan, someone wants to meet you." As he spoke, he put Zhao Ziqiang's business card on the table. When he saw it, he exclaimed "Ah!" and stood up. He took the business card in his hand and tossed it up and down a few times, saying, "He will come to visit me. This is really strange. Okay, please invite him in. I want to see what he has to say."

<h3>Two-Thousand-Year-Old Bread</h3>
<p>Long</p>
<p>Ren Shu Junbaichuan, who returned to China from Italy, said that at the bread exhibition held in Rome last July, there was actually bread dating back to two thousand years ago on display. This bread was discovered in the ruins of Mumbai. Its shape is very similar to ancient Dutch pastries. The color of the bread has turned into a fossil, "resembling stone but not stone." Archeologists have confirmed that it was made two thousand years ago. The bread displayed at the exhibition was of various styles, with almost ten thousand types, all made by bakers from various countries. At that time, the Italian Mussolini, in order to supplement national education, vigorously encouraged new ideas for bread.</p>
<h3>The Beer Pot Drunkard</h3>
<p>The</p>
<p>Czech town of Pilsen is where famous beer is brewed. Pedrola, a brewer who lived in this city and had been in the beer business for many years, suddenly committed suicide due to business failure. He suddenly threw himself into a boiling beer pot and was boiled to death. Later, a voice was suddenly heard in this beer pot. Upon closer listening, it was indeed Pedrola speaking inside. He said, "I committed suicide because the beer business was bad, but my body has rotted, but my soul is still strong, because my wronged soul cannot leave this pot." The brewing partners, upon hearing this ghostly talk, were all terrified and dared not approach. A strong man picked up the pot and took it to the exhibition hall, but it still caused a disturbance every night. Therefore, this strange event spread throughout the city of Pilsen.</p>
<h3>An Ominous Hint of Death</h3>
<p>In</p>
<p>Garcina, Italy, there is a very large printing house. The owner is named Teminico and is seventy-seven years old this year. His wife is named Terai and he has been married to her for forty years.</p>
<p>Recently, the couple held a commemorative ceremony, and relatives and friends from all over came to congratulate them. Teminico gave a speech to his relatives and friends about his forty years of life after marrying Terai and vowed to live and die together with his wife. Unexpectedly, after a few days, Terai suddenly died of a serious illness. When she died, she said to Teminico, "After I die, I will ask you to go to heaven to play in just three days." Although Teminico was very sad, the affairs of the printing house had not yet been settled, and he could not die with her for a while. On the third day, he suddenly developed a fever and sought famous doctors for treatment, but it was difficult to achieve any effect, and he died that night. This ominous hint of death spread throughout Italy.</p>
<p>[P Storks Jealous of Different Species</p>
<p>Near</p>
<p>the village of Ai He Fei near the city of Bursala in Turkey, there lives a villager named Ai Shengdi. He raised a pair of storks, and later a baby stork was born. The stork couple was originally very harmonious, but one day, they suddenly became agitated. The male stork, who used to return from the wild to feed the baby stork, changed his usual appearance and treated the female stork very badly. However, the female stork was not willing to take a loss and desperately resisted the male stork. Therefore, the male stork left the nest and called his companions elsewhere. They gathered and flew around in the sky above the nest. After about half an hour, the male stork and two other storks suddenly rushed into the nest and pecked the female stork to death. The male stork then grabbed a baby stork in the nest and threw it on the ground. Why? Because after the female stork laid her eggs, one day, the children in the village climbed up the tree and replaced one of the stork eggs with a turkey egg. Therefore, the baby turkey that was hatched was very jealous of the male stork. This is also a manifestation of interspecies killing.</p>
<h3>One Country, Only One Soldier</h3>
<p>— Chu</p>
<p>In</p>
<p>the middle of Switzerland and Austria, there is a small principality called Lichtenstein. The army in this country has only one person. This soldier is an old warrior who remained after the great war of 1866. This principality originally had a hundred elite soldiers. In 1866, in order to defend against the invasion of the Garibaldi soldiers of Italy, the entire army was dispatched. They patrolled the border for seventeen days and did not see any trace of the enemy, so they withdrew to the original defense capital. Later, the government of the country, because the cost of maintaining a hundred soldiers was too high, disbanded the entire army. Ninety-nine of them have died, and only one old warrior is still protecting his country with his sword.</p>

On the morning of the 19th, he was summoned to Beijing by Minister Wang of Education to discuss the reorganization of Peking University affairs. Xu told a Central News Agency reporter on the 20th that the Ministry of Education had ordered Peking University on June 1st to abolish the College of Commerce and the College of Arts, and to merge the Women's College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Law. Because he had already gone south, he did not receive this order. Yesterday, he met with Minister Wang and asked him to summon the deans of the four colleges of Law, Commerce, Arts, and Women's Liberal Arts to Beijing to discuss. A telegram has already been sent, and they should arrive in Beijing within days. The Ministry's order to resolve school affairs and implement the order must be discussed before there is any progress. He personally decided to resign from the position of president and specialize in teaching. He met with Cai Yuanpei and Li Shizeng in Shanghai, who both urged him to take on the arduous task. Minister Wang also repeatedly urged him to stay, but he still intends to resign firmly.</p>

Now that there are many practical difficulties, it may be possible to make slight changes without violating the principles of reorganization, but the abolition of departments and the suspension of enrollment will still be implemented in accordance with the Ministry's order. As for whether President Xu will continue to be responsible, it will be decided after this consultation. (Peking, 20th) The presidents of Peking University hope that the students will remain silent.

<h3>Contract Signed for Reprinting of Siku Quanshu (Complete Library in Four Sections)</h3>
<p>! Preemptive Photography and Plate-Making for Printing Within Two Years!</p>
<p>! Select and Print 300 Volumes of Rare Unprinted Editions!</p>
<p>! 100,000 Reams of Paper Ordered from Jiangnan Factory!</p>
<p>The case of reprinting the Siku Quanshu has been approved by the Executive Yuan. The Ministry of Education specially dispatched Jiang Fuzong, Director of the Preparation Department of the Central Library, to Shanghai on the morning of the 20th to sign a contract with the Commercial Press. Yesterday, our reporter paid a special visit to Mr. Wang Yunwu, General Manager of the General Library, who stated the following:</p>
<p>Contract Signed. After the draft contract for reprinting the Siku Quanshu was discussed and finalized by the Ministry of Education and our Press, the Ministry of Education specially dispatched Jiang Fuzong, Director of the Preparation Department of the Central Library, to Shanghai to formally sign the contract with me the day before yesterday, and it has been submitted to the Ministry of Education for record. The contents of the contract are: (1) First, select and print more than 300 rare unprinted editions from the Siku Quanshu, with each edition consisting of 90,000 pages of paper, bound into 1,500 volumes. Currently, 300 copies are being printed first. (2) The entire printing process must be completed within two years. (3) All printing labor and material costs will be borne by our Press. (4) After printing, 30 copies will be sent to the Ministry of Education, and the remaining copies will be sold by our Press without drawing royalties. (5) The copyright belongs to the Central Library, and future reprints must first obtain the consent of the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>Photography and Plate-Making. This reprint will use the Wen Yuan Ge edition, one of the only three existing rare editions of the Siku Quanshu, as the blueprint. The selection standard is (1) ancient books that have never been preserved in our country, (2) manuscripts that have never been engraved, and (3) engraved editions from the Song and Yuan dynasties that have been lost today. The Wen Yuan Ge edition is the earliest handwritten version in history, with fewer errors. It is currently stored in the Palace Museum in Peiping and has been moved south along with the cultural relics and stored in Shanghai. The Press believes that there are many errors in typesetting, so it has decided to use photographic printing. First, the Wen Yuan Ge edition will be photographed page by page. After all the photos are taken, photo-offset plates will be made and delivered to the offset printing plant of our Press in Yangshupu for printing, which is the same as the Four Series Collection published by our Press. The text content will be exactly the same as the original. It is estimated that one year will be spent on photography and plate-making, and one year will be spent on printing. It is expected that the entire process will be completed in two years and presented to the world.</p>
<p>Ordering Paper for Printing. The paper used for reprinting will require about 50,000 to 100,000 reams. In order to preserve the national essence, it has been decided to use Chinese paper. Jiangxi Province is the area with the most paper production in our country, but it has been trapped under the influence of the Red bandits for many years, and transportation is cut off, making procurement difficult. It has now been decided to order Chinese-style rough-edged paper from the Jiangnan Paper Manufacturing Company in this city, which will be produced with all its strength. This not only embodies the intention of promoting domestic goods but also demonstrates the development of our country's emerging industry. This time, our Press is undertaking the major task of a new era in the cultural history of our country, entirely for the sake of academics, with no profit to be made in terms of cost accounting. Fortunately, our Press has gradually recovered after the January 28th Incident and should be able to shoulder this responsibility.</p>
<h3>Opening of the School Selection Guidance Week at the Vocational Guidance Center of the China Vocational Education Society</h3>
<p>! Today at 9:00 AM!</p>
<p>The Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center of the China Vocational Education Society (80 Hualong Road, French Concession), in order to guide young people in their school selection, is holding a School Selection Guidance Week, divided into University Day, Vocational Day, Middle School Day, and Girls' School Day. Principals of various schools and leaders in the education field have been invited to speak on school selection issues, and various charts and publications related to school selection from various schools will be exhibited. There will also be specialists to provide consultation, discussion, and testing for young people selecting schools. This has been reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that the opening ceremony will be held at 9:00 AM today. Details will be published later.</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony. The opening ceremony will be held at 9:00 AM in the grand auditorium on the third floor of the Society. The order will be: (1) Opening, (2) All stand at attention, (3) Pay the highest respect to the national flag of the party and the portrait of Sun Yat-sen, (4) Read Sun Yat-sen's will respectfully, (5) Silent tribute, (6) Chairman delivers the opening speech, (7) Report on the purpose of the opening, (8) Director Pan of the Municipal Education Bureau delivers an exhortation, (9) Speeches by Mr. Ou Yuanhuai, Mr. Liu Zhanen, and Mr. Hu Cuishi, (10) Exhibition.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Venue. At the entrance of the Society is a horizontal plaque written by Zhang Zhuxi, "School Selection Guidance Week at the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center of the China Vocational Education Society". Room 202 on the second floor is the exhibition room, room 205 is the discussion and testing room, and room 303 on the third floor is the lecture hall. The corridors on the second and third floors are the display areas for various bookstores and schools. Various display charts, books, etc., are all of great help to young people selecting schools.</p>
<p>Exhibited Items. There are various books published by the Commercial Press, Zhonghua Book Company, World Book Company, and Datong Book Company that are beneficial to the physical and mental well-being of young people, as well as various charts and photographs from the China Vocational School, the Private Shanghai Middle School, the Sanlin Vocational School, the Private Huahua Middle School, the Sanyu Research Society, and the Shanghai Women's Supplementary School. There are also self-made maps of the locations of famous schools across the country, charts of the departments of various specialized schools across the country, tables of the establishment dates of famous schools, and comparative tables of the fees of famous schools, a list of the dates of this year's enrollment exams of famous schools, etc.</p>
<p>Organizing Committee. The chairman is Liu Zhanen. Other tasks such as reception are all handled by the entire staff of the Society. The records are taken by students from the Bingxun Stenography School on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Declaration of the Conference. The declaration of the School Selection Guidance Movement of the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center states: School selection is the first important and difficult hurdle for young people entering the world. One careless mistake can directly lead to lifelong suffering, and indirectly have a negative impact on society and the country. Since this center is responsible for guiding young people's careers, it believes that school selection is the preparation for young people's employment, and school selection guidance is a prerequisite for guiding young people in everything. Every summer, various schools produce batches of graduates, elementary schools move on to middle schools, junior high schools move on to senior high schools, and senior high schools move on to specialized schools or universities. For individuals, aspirations, personalities, talents, academic abilities, and even interests and family circumstances are all different. In society, environments are different, needs are different, and the departments, discipline, and special circumstances of each school are all different. To treat everyone the same and force conformity is certainly not in line with the principles of scientific guidance. At the end of this academic year, this center has received inquiries from young people from various places and schools about the path to school selection. At the same time, various places and schools have asked colleagues from this center to give lectures on school selection guidance. This center forgets its weakness and, based on recent surveys of 147 universities, specialized schools, middle schools, vocational schools, and normal schools across the country, and by requesting 33 articles from leading figures in the national education community and experts in various fields on school selection opinions, has compiled and published a thick volume entitled "School Selection Guide" as a guide for young people selecting schools. However, the introductions in the book and the declarations in the articles may not be fully developed or comprehensive.</p>
<p>Therefore, the School Selection Guidance Movement will be held from June 21st. The first day is University Day, dedicated to guiding senior high school graduates who want to enter universities. The second day is Middle School Day, dedicated to guiding elementary school and junior high school graduates who want to enter middle schools. The third day is Vocational Day, dedicated to guiding elementary school, junior high school, and senior high school students who want to enter specialized schools and vocational schools. The fourth day is Girls' School Day, dedicated to guiding elementary school and middle school girls in school selection. Education experts are invited to attend each day to answer questions from young people. At the same time, books and charts on school selection, as well as a list of the rules and regulations of various schools, will be displayed. A school selection consultation room is available at any time for students to inquire about school selection issues. Colleagues will adhere to the principle of "knowing everything and saying everything" and are extremely willing to serve young people in order to fulfill their responsibilities. However, the issue of school selection is complex and multifaceted. The main point is that, on the one hand, it lies in the individual's consideration of their talents, interests, and family circumstances to determine their direction. On the other hand, it lies in meeting the needs of society in order to prepare for benefiting the community in the future. In particular, it is necessary to break the following three kinds of pathologies: (1) the pursuit of vanity, (2) the attitude of blind obedience, and (3) the psychology of quick success, which are the great enemies of young people selecting schools. It is hoped that everyone will fundamentally eradicate and resolutely avoid them, and adopt scientific methods and objective attitudes, knowing oneself and knowing the other, assessing talents and abilities, in order to select suitable schools and suitable subjects. For oneself, it is necessary to maximize one's strengths. For others, it is necessary to meet the needs. It is also hoped that wise parents and enthusiastic teachers will pay attention and provide assistance together. Not only will the individual students benefit for life, but the country and society will also rely on it. This declaration is made to inform comrades.</p>
<h3>Zheng Hongnian Expresses Opinions on Higher Education Research</h3>
<p>Reform university curricula to suit actual conditions, improve university administration to focus on cultivating ability, guarantee independent education funding, and add surcharges to tobacco and alcohol taxes. Zheng Hongnian, director of the Shanghai Education Association and director of the Higher Education Research Committee, expressed the following opinions on higher education research to reporters from the Shanghai News:</p>
<h3>Reform University Curricula</h3>
<p>In recent years, I have heard the opinions of people from all walks of life and read articles and books published in newspapers and magazines regarding higher education research. The main issues can be summarized into the following three points. The first is the issue of curricula in universities or specialized schools. In literature, there is a recent trend to emphasize modern literature in order to align with the trend of modern material civilization development. This is what the ancient philosopher Xunzi called "following the later kings," which is originally based on modern society in order to seek progress.</p>
<p>We also quite agree with this. However, how should we effectively guide students so that they can make progress in an orderly manner and achieve great results in a short period of time? We have to carefully research the curricula. In the field of natural science, which is the basis for the development of material civilization, all countries in the world are doing their utmost to promote it in order to seek development. The progress of natural science relies heavily on research instruments and equipment. At present, very few universities in the country are fully equipped. Those who have a foundation in the field from abroad often have no way to continue their studies after returning to China. Students in the country are also unable to progress in conjunction with theory due to insufficient equipment, which reduces their interest. From ancient times, our country has had no research in natural science. Even if there was, it was only a fragmentary exploration based on individual interests, and there was no systematic approach. Under the current situation, we can only adopt the latest methods from Europe and the United States and catch up head-on. The discussion and research on how to enrich equipment and curricula remains to be done by specialists in this field. In the field of education, although there are many different theories, we should first discuss the education problems of our country. What is the situation in our country? If we forget or do not use it as a basis for discussion and development, it will be close to empty talk and difficult to conform to the actual situation. Among them, educational systems, etc., should be urgently referred to the situation in the past to study a system that is most suitable for modern times. In the field of social science, students who study it serve the society after graduation, but in most cases, there is no considerable efficiency. The reason for this should be that they study too many foreign books and neglect domestic history. Foreign books naturally take the social situation of the country as the background. It is natural for us to draw lessons from them as examples, but there are many things that are not suitable for the actual situation in our country. It seems that there is a certain order to the study of natural science, which is difficult at first and then perhaps easy. Social science ultimately needs to be based on reality, which seems easy at first and then more difficult. In guiding learning, we must seek appropriate reforms in the curriculum. In addition, the tools that students use to study, such as Chinese and English, are often not good enough. This is a major obstacle to practical research. Some advocate focusing on the research tools of Chinese and English in the first two years of university, and focusing on the exploration of the content of each subject in the third and fourth years. This is not without reason.</p>
<p>Improve University Administration. The second is the administrative issue of universities or specialized schools. Universities or specialized schools in China each administer themselves, which directly affects the efficiency of work and indirectly affects students' academic progress. Chinese people have always not paid attention to cultivating administrative ability in reading. For the past 260 years of the Qing Dynasty, administrative matters were only entrusted to Shaoxing secretaries to handle. This has to do with both knowledge and experience. The plan to improve the administrative issues of universities or specialized schools in the future, and to cultivate the administrative ability of young people to shoulder this heavy responsibility, depends on the discussion of experts.</p>
<p>Guarantee Independent Education Funding. The third is the funding issue of universities or specialized schools. According to Sun Yat-sen's legacy, education funding must be guaranteed to be independent. At present, there are very few places that can be independent and guaranteed due to various relationships. As a result, it is difficult for professors to teach with peace of mind, and students often abandon their studies due to political relations. I am not only concerned with the funding of public schools being independent and guaranteed, but private schools should also break away from the current phenomenon of viewing students' tuition as the only source of income. Issues such as how to raise funds and how to ask the government for subsidies should all have practical plans. I think that a little surcharge can be added to tobacco and alcohol taxes as education funding, as well as stamp tax. Other taxes, such as inheritance tax, should be levied in small amounts as education expenses. The Shanghai Education Association's Higher Education Research Association will invite experts from various fields to study these issues together and create a comprehensive plan, requesting the government to adopt and implement it.</p>
<h3>Mei Yiqi Arrives in Shanghai from Beijing</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 20th dispatch) President Mei Yiqi of Tsinghua University came to Beijing a few days ago to meet with Education Commissioner Wang to discuss school affairs. He will go to Shanghai on the 20th and return to Beijing and then to Pingjing soon.</p>
<h3>Military Academy Entrance Exam Scheduled for Re-examination</h3>
<p>After the preliminary examination of students admitted to the 10th term of the Central Army Military Academy, the Shanghai and Wuhan governments were entrusted to handle the preliminary examination of candidates. In Shanghai, the preliminary examination was handled by the Education and Public Security Bureaus. The two bureaus have now received a telegram from the academy stating that the re-examination will begin on the 27th of this month in Beijing. This has been announced in the newspapers. The students who passed the preliminary examination in this city should report to the Education Bureau on the 22nd of this month. It is also heard that Shao Buchi and Zhou Xianchu have been appointed to escort the students to Beijing. They will gather at the North Railway Station at 6:00 AM on the 23rd and depart on the 7:00 AM Jinghu Express.</p>
<h3>Municipal Education Bureau to Conduct Screening of Students from Unregistered Specialized Schools</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau will conduct a screening examination for graduates and students of unregistered and closed private specialized schools and above. The announcement states that the Ministry of Education issued Order No. 5016, ordering that another screening examination for graduates and students of unregistered and closed private specialized schools and above be held from July 15th of this year. Registration will be from June 21st to 30th. Graduates and students of unregistered and closed private specialized schools and above who had the following qualifications at the time of admission: (1) graduation from a senior high school, (2) graduation from a vocational school equivalent to a senior high vocational course, (3) graduation from an old-system middle school or completion of one year of senior high school and completion of two years of preparatory courses for universities, (4) graduation from an old-system middle school or equivalent school and two years of service, may register with the Bureau during the scheduled period, fill out a resume, and submit a graduation certificate, a service certificate, two 4-inch portrait photos, and a screening fee of one yuan. They may obtain the regulations, wait for qualification review, and select a place for the examination. In addition to those who graduated from unregistered private high schools and are currently studying in public or registered private specialized schools and above, whether or not they should participate in this examination has been telegraphed to the Ministry of Education for instructions. This announcement is hereby made.</p>

<h3>News of the Second Batch of Disaster Relief Funds for Secondary Schools in this City</h3>
<p>The Disaster Relief Committee for Secondary Schools in this city sent representatives Wu Jiangleng, Sun Yuanzhou, Wei Qun, etc., to the Municipal Education Bureau yesterday to urge the distribution of the second batch of relief funds. Section Chief Zhou Feicheng received them and informed them that although the relief funds were in the Bureau, the proposed distribution method had not yet been approved by the War Zone Relief Committee and could not be distributed. The representatives explained in detail the situation that the schools were short of funds at the end of the semester. Section Chief Zhou understood the difficulties of the schools and agreed to pay a portion of the funds in advance for relief, which could be collected approximately on Monday (the 26th). The representatives were satisfied. It has been decided to report that a temporary general meeting will be held at 11:00 AM this Saturday (the 24th) at the Gongdelin Vegetarian Restaurant to discuss this issue.</p>
<p>[P Students About to Study Abroad&gt;</p>
<p>The Chinese Students' Association on Carter Road has announced that according to recent surveys, no less than 80 students from various universities and personnel dispatched by public institutions and private individuals in the country are preparing to study abroad this summer. As of yesterday, more than 30 people have registered with the association and entrusted it to handle all the procedures for going abroad.</p>
<h3>News of Private Shanghai Middle School Autumn Enrollment</h3>
<p>Private Shanghai Middle School has been well-managed and serious in its studies, and has always been praised by people from all walks of life. Since moving to the old site of Datong University on Jiaozhou Road last year, the school's affairs have made even greater progress. The school buildings are spacious, the playground is large, and the spirit and form complement each other. The school has now decided to hold the first new student enrollment on July 5th at 9:00 AM and has already started registration. It is heard that the school will open remedial courses in Chinese, English, mathematics, and physics during the summer vacation, hiring expert professors. After the new students have completed the remedial courses, they can be inserted into the appropriate grade, exempting them from the entrance examination. Therefore, the number of new students going to register these days is extremely crowded.</p>
<p>Tennis Davis Cup European Zone</p>
<h3>England Also Wins Final Rights</h3>
<p>Eliminating Czech Republic to Meet Australia, Japan Takes Australian Singles (Reuters, London, 19th) England won the Davis Cup European Zone final and will meet Australia in the final. In the second round of the England-Czech Republic rematch, Pannesses won another straight three sets against Manuel Marek, 6-2, 6-4, 6-4. On the first day, England won both singles, totaling a 3-0 elimination of the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>Japan Wins Last Two Singles Against Australia (Havas News Agency, Paris, 19th) Today was the third and final day of the Davis Cup European Zone semi-final between Japan and Australia. Japan had already been eliminated by Australia, so today's match was irrelevant. In the first group, the match between Buji and McCray of Australia was very interesting. McCray struck the backhand with both hands holding the racket, which was peculiar in shape, and the ball he struck was quite powerful and difficult to return. McCray's forehand was weaker. Buji noticed this and attacked McCray's forehand from time to time, so he won two sets in a row. In the third set, McCray made great efforts to cheer up and won 8-6. After the break, the match continued. Although Buji showed signs of fatigue, he finally won the fourth set 7-5 and defeated McCray. The final score was 6-4, 6-4, 6-8, 7-5. The match between Sato and Crawford in the last group was unremarkable. The ball Sato struck was the easiest to deal with. Crawford did not try to return the ball hard. Sato was extremely tired after the fierce battles in the previous two days, but he still fought hard and finally won 3-6, 6-3, 6-1, 1-6, 6-2. In the three-day total, Australia eliminated Japan 3-2. Among the players on both sides, Buji was extremely formidable and deserves to be ranked among the best in the tennis world.</p>
<p>Today's Grass Tennis League</p>
<h3>China Meets Japan</h3>
<p>Strong Opponents Should Be Dealt With Hard. The weather is uncertain at the Japanese Tennis Court at 5:00, depending on the weather. In the Shanghai Grass Tennis A Group League, the China Tennis Club will meet its strong opponent, the Japan Tennis Club, today, starting at 5:00 PM at the Japan Tennis Court on the Eastern Sports Association Road behind the Shooting Range. Japan is the holder of the championship and has won the championship for three consecutive years. Last year, the China Club lost the championship to the Japanese by two points. This year, Japan's strength is weaker. Last week, they lost to the Inside and Outside Factories 5-10. Judging from China's current strength, they should be able to win a big victory. China has already won three games in a row and hopes to strike hard and win the championship, which they have rarely touched. This year, there is hope of winning it. The weather has been rainy and uncertain recently. Whether or not the match can be played depends on the weather. Players should contact Li Jihun at 30232 in the morning. The list of the China Club is as follows:</p>
<p>Lin Maihua, Qiu Feihai, Jiang Zhang, Zheng Guangjia, Yu Tianguang, Sun Fang, Liang Deguang, Qian Yaobin, Zhou Guanjun, Zheng Zirong.</p>
<h3>Today's Order</h3>
<p>China Tennis Club vs. Japan Tennis Club, Japan Tennis Court. Citibank Country Club vs. South Grassland, Citibank General Club. Xieqiao General Club vs. French Chamber of Commerce, Xieqiao General Club. South Grassland vs. Inside and Outside Factories, Running Hall. Portugal has a bye.</p>
<h3>Philippines Santo Thomas Baseball Team</h3>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai from Japan on the 23rd and Agreed to Play the McLeans Team. The Philippine Santo Thomas University baseball team visited Shanghai in mid-April and went to Japan. Its basketball team also played a match in Shanghai. The team is now returning to the Philippines from Japan, triumphantly returning on the Asia Empress. They will arrive in Shanghai on the 23rd (Friday) and stay here for a short time. They have agreed with the McLeans team to hold a friendly match at the China Baseball Field that afternoon to learn from each other.</p>
<h3>Donghua Football Team's Philippine Expedition (5)</h3>
<p>Fifth match, 4-1 victory over Xavier Qi (By Wenchu, our Philippine reporter, sent from Manila)</p>
<h3>Four to One Victory Over Salvoe</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 8th) was the fifth match for the Tung Wah team, their opponent being the champion team of the all-Malayan club, Turba Salvoe, known for their fierce and skilled play. (Last year, when South China went to the Philippines, they won all seven matches, but this team was somewhat stubborn and, while not unbeatable, proved difficult. Their overall strength was quite formidable.) In today's match, both goalkeepers were top-notch in the Far East, showcasing excellent performances. Lu Zhongen's ability to evade opponents with his basketball skills was particularly impressive, often causing Philippine forwards to stumble during their attacks.</p>
<p>[P The Opening Contact Was Fierce&gt;</p>
<p>At 5:15, after the customary group photo and choosing of goals, both sides set up their formations. At the whistle, Tung Wah launched an attack through the center, chasing the ball forward and reaching the Philippine territory. Chen Hongguang lobbed the ball to Cao Qiuting, who bent down, hooked it with his foot, and passed to Chen Yutian, who charged in for a shot. The ball went slightly high and missed. Taking advantage of the favorable wind, the Philippine team quickly gained possession and launched a long drive, directly threatening our defense. Their center forward intercepted the ball and passed it far to the left wing, who sprinted forward and swept the ball with a kick. The ball rolled diagonally to the right, where the Philippine right inside forward rushed to kick it, but missed by a hair's breadth, sending the ball out of bounds. A great opportunity was lost by a fraction of an inch. The Western spectators applauded, expressing their regret and acknowledging the impressive momentum of the game.</p>
<h3>Great! Lu Xun Retreats Foes from His Tent</h3>
<p>While both sides were intensely vying for the ball, the Philippine team suddenly gained a free kick 15 yards from our goal. Their center forward took the kick, lofting it into the air. The five Philippine forwards surged forward, attempting to overwhelm our goal. Lu was quick-witted; though surrounded, he dodged left and right, kicking the ball clear. The entire stadium cheered and applauded. Unexpectedly, the ball didn't travel far and was intercepted by the opposing left center back, who formed a one-on-one situation, taking it past the center line and passing it to the right inside forward, who shot powerfully. But Lu was prepared, calmly catching the ball. These two instances of averting danger were akin to Lu Boyan (Lu Xun) strategically commanding from his tent, repelling Liu Xianzhu's hundreds of thousands of troops.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Fortress Breached, Efforts Wasted</h3>
<p>From then on, our team's formation gradually improved. Tu Kaiyuan received a free kick 20 yards from the enemy goal on the right, sending a long shot that narrowly missed the goal. Wan Xianghua probed from the left and suddenly received the ball, passing it to Cao Qiuting, who passed it to Li Yichen. Li turned, confusing the defenders, and shot. The ball flew like an arrow but was caught by the Western goalkeeper. In the ensuing melee in front of the enemy goal, Li Yichen received a high pass from Chen Jiaqiu and headed it towards the goal, but it was again caught by the goalkeeper. During these few minutes, both goalkeepers displayed their excellent skills. Just as the Western team celebrated having weathered the crisis, Li Yichen and Cao Qiuting returned, charging a ball through the crowd. The spectators roared with joy, but the referee ruled the goal invalid because Cao Qiuting was offside before the ball entered. It was as if Sima Zhongda (Sima Yi) survived being burned in the Hulu Valley.</p>
<h3>Hastily Facing the Enemy, Almost Falling into the Trap</h3>
<p>When Tung Wah failed to score, the Philippine team sought revenge, frequently attacking our goal, aided by the favorable wind. Our defense was breached several times, but fortunately, Feng and Li remained calm, and Lu Zhongen defended the city with all his might, preventing the Western team from succeeding. As halftime approached, the sky filled with dark clouds, and a light drizzle began. Wu Youliang, in his eagerness to win the ball, mistakenly touched the ball with his hand 15 yards from our goal, resulting in a free kick for the opposing left center back. The kick went too high and missed. Tung Wah weathered this dangerous moment, boosting their courage tenfold.</p>
<h3>Changing Formation, Bravely Taking the Lead</h3>
<p>After the break, both sides reorganized. Our team, recognizing the enemy's weakness, moved Chen Jiaqiu to right inside forward, Cao Qiuting to right wing, Feng Yunyou to center back, and Guan Xun'an to right back, also changing tactics to flank from the left and right while attacking through the center. As the game resumed, this proved surprisingly effective. After five minutes of play, Wan Ruhou probed along the side, dodging the Western team's center back and evading the back, and then sent a long pass to the center, landing perfectly in front of the goal. The five tigers charged in, and Li Yichen, breaking free from the crowd, headed the ball, but the Western goalkeeper punched it out. Just as they thought the danger had passed, Chen Jiaqiu rushed in and kicked the ball in, catching the Western goalkeeper off guard. As a result, the enemy fortress was breached.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Fortress Is Breached Again Amidst the Melee</h3>
<p>Having broken the deadlock, our team's morale soared. Chen Hongguang and Cao Qiuting frequently made excellent passes and shots, but they were all caught. While both teams were fiercely battling, Wan Ruhou suddenly received a ball from Feng Yunyou in the center, immediately passing it to Chen Hongguang, who passed it to Cao Qiuting. Known for his powerful and accurate shots, Cao seized this opportunity, taking a shot. The Western goalkeeper dove to save it but was unable to reach it.</p>
<h3>An Unexpected Stroke of Luck Breaks the Record</h3>
<p>Although under immense pressure, the opposing team continued to resist, making considerable progress. Our forward, in his eagerness to win the ball, committed a foul, resulting in a penalty kick. The center forward took the kick and scored. The Philippine team treasured this goal as if it were a rare gem. In our second, third, and fourth matches, we had not allowed the enemy to score a single goal, but now, due to this penalty, we had conceded a goal, breaking our shutout record, which was still something to be proud of.</p>
<h3>Scoring Two More Spectacular Goals in the Last Five Minutes</h3>
<p>After conceding the penalty, our team, fearing a repeat of the first match, fought even harder. The five forwards launched an all-out attack. Cao Qiuting received a pass from Wan Ruhou, dribbling in from the right, taking a shot. The ball was low and fast. The Western goalkeeper dove to catch it, but failed, and the ball rolled into the goal, marking our third success. After the kickoff, the Tung Wah forwards, confident of victory, relentlessly attacked. The consecutive shots were like a string of pearls. It could be said to be Tung Wah's golden period. Wan Ruhou initiated an attack from the flank, passing it to Cao Qiuting, who lobbed it to the center. Li Yichen saw the opportunity and charged forward, surrounded by two defenders. Li then executed a ground shot, stretching out his right foot while lying on the ground. The ball flew like an arrow, straight into the net, marking our fourth success, breaking the record for the highest score in five consecutive matches.</p>

<h3>Flood</h3>
<p>— Fengyin</p>
<p>In ancient Chinese history, there was an era described in the "Book of Documents" as "vast floods." Mencius described this era as "floods overflowing, inundating the world, plants and trees flourishing, birds and beasts multiplying, grains planted but not harvested, birds and beasts threatening humans, and the paths of animal hooves and bird tracks crisscrossing China." Therefore, "Yu personally wielded the hoe and dredged the nine rivers of the world, exhausting his limbs, his shins becoming hairless, bathing in heavy rain, combing his hair in the wind" (Zhuangzi, Tianxia Chapter), "Dredging the nine rivers, dredging the Ji and Ze, and emptying them into the sea, diverting the Ru and Han rivers, draining the Huai and Si rivers, and emptying them into the Yangtze River, so that the water flowed underground." It can be seen that floods existed in ancient times and are not particularly severe now. The emperor at that time, according to records, was both desperately trying to control the floods and "praying in the wilderness," saying, "The people have no fault, the fault lies with me..." This meant that the ordinary people should not be held responsible, but the blame should be placed entirely on the emperor himself.</p>
<p>Later, things changed. Wu Wuxiang's "Three Strokes of Suixiang" records that in the year Yiyou, the Guilin Water Disaster was reported by Li Zhongcheng of Guangxi, saying that the disaster originated when "first a cyan aura was seen, then it turned into a white aura, and then a black aura, and the water followed immediately, greatly resembling 'the Yellow River water coming from the sky.'" At that time, Qin Wenbo, an insightful observer, added forcefully, "The scholars saw it, its shape like a cow, rolling on the ground, the water connecting with the sky, truly a strange disaster." How did this "strange disaster" occur? Qin's conclusion was: "The deep mountains and valleys of Guangxi are rarely visited by humans, so the laws cannot be enforced, and natural disasters prevail, which is the will of Heaven. Accumulating virtue to turn Heaven around may be helpful?" This meant that the moral climate was deteriorating like a river, and the emperor could not be held responsible for the floods, nor could the officials be held responsible. The common people should come out and take the blame entirely on themselves, saying, "The emperor is innocent, the officials are innocent, the fault lies with the people."</p>
<p>Now there is an even newer form. The responsibility for the disaster lies neither with "me," nor with the "people," nor with the "officials." Therefore, in Wuhan, "mountain floods have broken out for days, and many streets have been flooded," and the Jianghan Dike Construction Bureau immediately declared "it has nothing to do with them." The provincial government telegraphed, "The Jianghan Dike Construction Bureau is the only competent authority for dike construction. When things come to a head, they actually shirk responsibility to the local government," and they felt "a sense of dread for the future." Although the provincial government said, "We dare not shirk responsibility," the common people were truly heartbroken. Therefore, it ultimately led to "while the local and central governments were shifting responsibility to each other, the tide continued to rise," and "the people's hearts became more and more panicked."</p>
<p>But the issue of responsibility was finally clarified. The Hankou special dispatch on the 15th is proof: "The total cost of earth and stone work is about 1.4 million yuan. This project has been deemed satisfactory by experts from the League of Nations, and the labor costs are low, saving a lot compared to the past, which has been met with satisfaction from all parties." This not only has various bases, but also has the foreign devils of the League of Nations as witnesses. No one has any responsibility to bear. Here, the truth is very clear.</p>
<p>Since the dike construction is "all solid and economical," but floods still occur, it is "really an accident." Who should bear the responsibility for this "accident"? Speaking of this, the people felt inexplicable.</p>
<h3>Leaving Out the Clown</h3>
<p>— Daliu</p>
<p>I don't talk about clowns and painted faces because I look down on these types of characters.</p>
<p>The powdered white face is like Cao Cao, "I would rather betray the world than let the world betray me," he declared on the stage. The lowest type is like a minor clown, he confesses to the audience as soon as he appears:</p>
<p>"Minor clown, minor clown, money comes in, you are my uncle, so I don't want your money."</p>
<p>Although this lacks humor, the true colors of a hero have their own lovability.</p>
<p>The dignified leading male represents the gentlemanly type, but Yang Liulang, who executes his son at the gate, is mocked by the painted face:</p>
<p>"My commander is disloyal, unfilial, unkind, and unjust. The Eighth Prince's plea is rejected, which is disloyal. The plea of the Old Dowager She is rejected, which is unfilial. Our plea is rejected, which is unkind. Mu Guiying's plea is approved, which is unjust."</p>
<p>Jiao Zan and Meng Liang criticized their commander like this, exposing the face of the gentleman in front of the audience. Although this also lacks humor, when we can still recognize that the leading male is a gentlemanly type, the true colors of a hero are still somewhat revealed.</p>
<p>The character on stage I look down on the most is the non-dignified leading male and the young male. Fan Zhongyu comes out of the box, acting crazy to the left and foolish to the right. Wang Jinlong visits prison, and meeting the black-robed officer, cursing from the Jade Emperor to the little demons, showing his madness. I don't know to what extent they are humorous, I only know that they represent bureaucrats and talented scholars.</p>
<p>In the novel "The Cases of Shi Gong," there is a mad monk pointing at Shi Gong and scolding:</p>
<p>"To say you are loyal is not really loyal, to say you are good is not really treacherous... It is hard to distinguish between loyalty and treachery, specializing in taking money into private pockets." Officials want money, and scholars are shameless. In short, the current trend is what I despise. Why do the actors of today only have this set of tricks?</p>
<h3>Country Night</h3>
<p>— Lingjing</p>
<p>If the night in the city belongs to the modern era, then the night in the countryside truly represents ancient times. Don't believe me? Go and stay for one night, especially if you're coming from a metropolis. There are no people, no sounds, no lights, except for the occasional dog bark from afar, the rest is deathly silence.</p>
<p>To be honest, I am afraid of the nights in the countryside. Living in the countryside for a month, I was uneasy almost every night, and even now, when I recall it, I feel an indescribable discomfort. Think about it. A square, large room, surrounded by gray and moldy walls, a very high ceiling, with rafters exposed. Even during the day, the room seems gloomy and terrible, coupled with the dim oil lamp at night, the faint whistling wind outside the door, and the frightening echoes that reverberate from the walls with the slightest movement or cough. If you look out the window, there are shadowy figures swaying back and forth as if many ghostly figures are rushing towards the window. No matter how I explain to myself that these are the wheat stalks swaying in the wind, that this is my favorite oleander, I can't believe it in my heart, and I remain suspicious, often not daring to stare too closely before quickly pulling my head back.</p>
<p>I swore to myself to calm my mind and focus all my thoughts on one thing, so I read a book. But after reading only three or four lines, I naturally drifted to other things. Sometimes I read the words one by one, turning the pages, but afterwards I couldn't even remember the title of the book. What I thought about was almost entirely pessimistic. Originally, there had been times of joy and triumph in my life, but at this time I seemed unable to recall them. What I thought about was always when I was betrayed by someone, when I was deceived by someone, when my mother died, when my family went bankrupt, when...etc. Why is this? Sometimes when I thought of sad things, I would actually cry. When I thought of anger and resentment, I almost wanted to pick up the paper cutter and commit suicide. Occasionally, I would look up and see a shadow flash past the window, and my heart would jump, my thoughts becoming even more confused, and I wouldn't even dare to go out to urinate.</p>
<p>At this point, there was no way to help myself, so I could only sleep. But suddenly strange thoughts would arise, feeling that someone had died in this room, otherwise why would it be so gloomy? And the dead person was sleeping in my bed, maybe it was a hanged ghost. It must be on that beam in the middle. The more I thought about it, the more terrible it became, so I could only resolve not to sleep. But I couldn't stay awake forever, so I decided to go to this ancient countryside where, although I was uneasy every night, I still lived for a month. And this fear was only in the night. Every time I hoped for the east to turn white, I would jump out of my sleepless bed and shout loudly: "Now it is the world of people!" and run to the sunny fields to use sunlight to cleanse the bad air from the previous night.</p>
<h3>Exam Strike</h3>
<p>— Lusha</p>
<p>A scene from the sixth examination hall</p>
<p>Today, the air of striking the exam is even stronger, and it finally broke out during mealtime...</p>
<p>Chairs and tables are rattling, bowls and chopsticks are rattling, crowds are bustling, everyone's heart is like being pressed by a stone, ah! Upset!! One two three, strike the exam!</p>
<p>The students of Minli and Datong opened the curtain of the strike! How about the middle school?! Send representatives to discuss with XX.</p>
<p>The representative came out and walked to Mr. XX! What does the high school matter have to do with junior high school! After the representative stated the reason for the strike, he unexpectedly hit an unexpected nail and walked away silently! XX Middle School is unique! Tut! Tut!</p>
<p>Everyone's heartstrings were even more tense due to the commotion. But the food came, and the people's hearts calmed down. After eating, the students of Minli and Datong searched for the proctor in groups, but could not find him.</p>
<p>The silver rooster crowed, and the examination time came. The students of XX took their writing brushes and walked to the gate of the examination hall.</p>
<p>! No entry allowed!</p>
<p>! XX Middle School stole the papers!</p>
<p>! Run out!</p>
<p>Close the door!</p>
<p>Bang! The door of the examination hall closed.</p>
<p>The proctor ran out, and a handful of sand was immediately thrown down, and the invigilator fell to the ground, and the handbag was thrown a zhang away. The strike was finally realized!</p>
<p>The students of XX Middle School finally left in grievance because of the small number of people.</p>
<p>! Good student?</p>
<p>! Model student?</p>
<p>! In the end, I came for three days, and the merits were complete?</p>
<p>A burst of ridicule and applause sent the students of the middle school out of the gate.</p>
<h3>Red Carrot Whiskers</h3>
<p>— Written by Jules Renard, translated by Lin Qu</p>
<p>Silver Coins</p>
<p>Three (Continued)</p>
<p>Red Carrot Whiskers! What? You see, it's here.</p>
<p>The Lepic family's! You see, it's here.</p>
<p>Red Carrot Whiskers! Let me see it.</p>
<p>The Lepic family's! Let me see it too.</p>
<p>Red Carrot Whiskers (He took out his silver coin. The Lepic family's also took out hers. Red Carrot Whiskers picked up the two coins, comparing them, preparing his words.)! This is really strange. Where did you find it, Mom? I found it on this road, under the pear tree. I originally walked over it twenty times, but didn't find it. It was shining there. At first, I thought it was a piece of paper or a white flower. I didn't dare to pick it up at the time. This is probably because I was rolling on the grass one day and it fell out of my pocket. Please lean down, Mom, and take a look at where it's hidden. It can be proud of having caused me trouble.</p>
<p>The Lepic family's! I don't deny your words. But I found the silver coin you lost in another one of your coats. I have told you many times, but when you change clothes, you still forget to take the things out of your pockets. I want to give you a lesson in orderliness. I let you look for it so you know the stakes. Who knows what you'll find, because now you have not only one silver coin, but two. Well, you're all money now. Everything good always ends well, but I have to tell you that money will not make people happy.</p>
<p>Red Carrot Whiskers! So, can I go play now, Mom?</p>
<p>The Lepic family's! Of course. Go play, you are at the age to play. Take your two silver coins. Red Carrot Whiskers! Ah! Mom, one is enough for me, and please keep even this one for me and give it to me when I need it. That way I'll like you.</p>
<p>The Lepic family's! No, accounts must be clear for feelings to be good. Go and hide your two silver coins. The one your godfather gave you and the other one you found under the pear tree, both should belong to you, as long as the owner doesn't come to claim it. Who exactly left this money? My brain is empty from thinking. What about you, have you guessed who it is?</p>
<p>Red Carrot Whiskers! No, I don't care about that. I'll think about it again tomorrow. See you later, Mom, and thank you. The Lepic family's! Wait a minute! Isn't this the gardener's?</p>
<p>Red Carrot Whiskers! Would you like me to run and ask him?</p>
<p>The Lepic family's! Stand here, be good, help me. Let's think about it again. Your father is old enough that he wouldn't be so negligent. Your sister puts her saved money in a money jar. Your brother doesn't have the luxury of losing money, he would spend any money he had right away. In the end, maybe I dropped it.</p>
<p>Red Carrot Whiskers! Mom, that won't happen... You are so meticulous.</p>
<p>The Lepic family's! Sometimes adults can make mistakes like children. Let's check this matter later. In short, this silver coin has only to do with me. We won't talk about it now. You don't need to worry anymore. Go play, be good, don't go too far, wait for me to go and take a look at the drawer of my sewing table. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Financial News: American Silver and Exchange Rates Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>Gold Price Plummets to 99.8 Yuan</p>
<p>U.S. Representative Proposes Gold and Silver Bimetallism to Increase Silver Price</p>
<p>The market experienced a rapid and drastic fall yesterday, causing widespread anxiety. It broke through the 890 yuan mark. Selling pressure was strong. In the morning, prices of both American and British silver rose. The forward silver price on the Gold Exchange rose by 9.5 to 11 points. Exchange rates rose sharply by more than 7 points. Stock prices increased by more than 5 yuan. American wheat and cotton also rose strongly. The raw silk market immediately broke through the 900 yuan mark. After the opening, there were repeated ups and downs, generally following the fluctuations in the market. Due to unfavorable news, anxiety increased. The previous market had already broken through the 90 yuan mark, and the subsequent market was even more dire. Bombay initially rose 6 annas, then retreated slightly to 2 annas. The exchange market tightened, and the gold price also rose briefly, but eventually remained within the 90 yuan range. Speculators initially exited, then re-entered, covering many short positions (goods handled by No. 131 agency exceeded 560). Mr. Luo sold off approximately 2,000 (Yuan Mao Yong). The Cantonese raw silk merchants sold at high prices and bought at low prices. The situation of the day was bleak due to news from foreign telegrams that the Monetary Committee of the Economic Conference, the U.S. representative, proposed reducing gold reserves and adopting silver bimetallism, advocating for the recall of cash to prevent circulation, and that Washington believed that temporarily stabilizing exchange rates offered little benefit, thus impacting the gold market. The "cooked red" price was increased by 100 yuan. A record of the day's market situation follows:</p>
<p>Morning</p>
<p>Opened at 894.8 yuan, a decrease of 24 yuan from the previous close. Goods opened at 3 yuan. The exchange market initially opened strong for both British and American currencies. The near-term selling price for British exchange was 1 shilling 3 pence 375, and for American exchange, 26.5625 yuan. September American dollars at .0625 were difficult to sell. Bing Xing, Fu Chang, Yuan Sheng, and Yong Ju Xian, all sought to sell at 2 yuan even at the exchange for September delivery, .0625. Yi Yi Yong Jin took delivery. Prices rose briefly, but the spot exchange market weakened sharply. September American dollars at .25 were unwanted. Goods were smoothly sold by Shun Li Zhi, Yong Yuan Sheng and Yong, and prices fell to 88.5 yuan. HSBC quoted British exchange up 1.25 and American exchange up .75. When the prices were announced, the situation had already turned unfavorable. Banks' appetite gradually improved, and the market recovered. The gold price gradually increased. Heng Xing, Heng Yu, Da Fa Yong, Da Xing Yong all bought, rising to 96.2 yuan. They exchanged September delivery at .0625. Rui Xing and Heng Xing re-entered, fluctuating around 4 yuan. Chartered Mercantile Bank of India, London and China (MCB) traded October delivery at 3.125. Yuan Kang, Xiang Hong Li bought up to 5.4 yuan.

Qian Chang Xiang, Qing Fa Yong, Da Yu Yong, Fu Yu, Zhi Feng Yong, and others all sold off, with prices falling to 88.5 yuan. Heng Xing and Hong Li bought at low prices. MCB bought October delivery at 4.375, and prices briefly returned to 91.6 yuan.

HSBC traded October delivery at .5 yuan. The noon close was 888.6 yuan, with goods traded at 9 yuan.</p>
<p>Afternoon</p>

MCB bought October delivery at .5 yuan. Yi Feng Yong, Fu Yu, and Heng Yu bought at low prices, and prices rose to 8 yuan. Heng Xing, Yuan Mao Yong, and Yuan Heng started selling again, and prices retreated to 5.5 yuan. Thereafter, the exchange market gradually stabilized.

Yuan Mao Yong had strong selling intentions. Other dealers wanted to cover October delivery at .5 yuan but failed. Prices retreated to 6 yuan. Later, other dealers sold October American dollars at .5625, and both the market and MCB took delivery. The trend was good. Bombay also edged up 2 annas, boosting market confidence.

The final result was a sharp drop of 29.8 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>Posted</p>
<p>Prices rose because HSBC's American exchange rate increased .75 to 26.125 yuan, and the corresponding gold price was 918.66 yuan. Based on the closing price, the deduction was approximately 29 yuan, exceeding the previous close by more than 2.5 yuan.

The "cooked red" price was increased by 100 yuan. Transactions remained scarce, because Hong Kong prices were higher than those in Shanghai, and demand was strong. It was heard that Da De Cheng sold to Hong Kong customers at a price increased by 114 yuan. For the June/July swap, Yuan Kang Xiang paid Tong Feng Heng 21 shares at 11 yuan.

<h3>Auxiliary Coin Market Generally Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of small Jiangnan silver coins remained the same as the previous day due to infrequent trading. The opening price for both morning and noon markets was 850 yuan .05 jiao. Transactions of 5,000 jiao were made in the morning market, and 3,000 jiao in the noon market. The price of small Guangdong silver coins was</p>
<p>773.2 yuan in the morning market and 773.5 yuan in the noon market, only a small increase of .2 jiao from the previous day. Transactions of 65,000 jiao were made in the morning market, and 35,000 jiao in the noon market. Copper coins remained at 317,000 cash, with increased transactions totaling 44,380 strings, plus 14,000 yuan in equivalent silver dollars.</p>
<h3>The Securities and Bond Market Suddenly Became Active</h3>
<p>A short squeeze gradually emerged, and various bonds rose sequentially. The "Full Six" bonds showed particularly strong gains. Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, the market suddenly became active, reversing the chaotic and sluggish state of the past few days. Various groups needed to cover their short positions and engage in new transactions, especially in the July market. The price increases were quite strong. Although the reasons were rumored to be unverifiable, the emergence of a short squeeze was undeniable. Its trend, from morning to night, was a continuous, stable increase. The upward trend from the opening to the closing was approximately .3 or .4 jiao. Among them, the "Full Six" bonds showed the strongest gains, while the "19 Customs" bonds had the weakest gains. This was because the "19 Customs" bonds were continuously sold from the 14th, suppressing the market price. On the other hand, swapping into other bonds was more cost-effective due to the discounts. The "Full Six" bonds had remaining "branches" similar to the demobilization bonds, and their market prices differed by more than 10 yuan, so everyone favored them. The "96" transactions had been quite lively for several days. On the one hand, the market price was very small, and speculators felt the risks were lower, so the volume of transactions was lighter. On the other hand, the bulls fabricated rumors of replenishing interest, which gradually made the market active and called them "waste tickets," but there were still many buyers. The daily transactions totaled approximately 700,000 to 800,000, and the market price fluctuated by about .5 yuan. In summary, the market price results for yesterday showed increases ranging from .2 or .3 jiao to 1.2 yuan. The "Full Six" bonds alone increased by 1.5 yuan, and the "96" bonds also increased by .5 or .6 jiao. The market prices of many bonds reached new highs. The total number of transactions was 14,454,900 yuan, including 9,000 yuan in spot transactions and 4.48 million in total taxes on futures, 1.92 million in "Qianbing" bonds, 2.4 million in "19 Customs" bonds, and 3.45 million in "20 Customs" bonds. The remainder ranged from tens of thousands to 660,000. The "96" bonds accounted for 700,000 in transactions.</p>
<h3>New York Stocks Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>New Fung Foreign Trade Company reported that on Monday (the 19th), the New York stock market was exceptionally strong. The upward trend was unseen since the banking crisis subsided. Some specific stocks even rose by 10 yuan. One reason was due to favorable commercial news and strong cotton and wheat markets, but the main reason was still the sharp decline in the U.S. dollar, especially against the British pound. This was because the World Economic Conference had not achieved any results in stabilizing national currencies. The total daily transactions were 5.28 million shares. The Dow Jones index is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 95.99 Up 5.76 20 Railroad Stocks 44.73 Up 3.06 20 Utility Stocks 36.26 Up 2.87 40 Bonds 84.55 Up 0.37</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Weak and Listless</h3>
<p>Yarn</p>
<p>Market opened flat in the morning, declined in the afternoon. The situation was very weak, because spot yarn sales were not smooth, and the monthly futures were approaching, with short sellers adequately prepared to deliver. Consequently, the attitude of the bulls weakened day by day. In the afternoon, rumors were rampant in the market that military conflicts in Sichuan Province greatly affected yarn sales. Some were even dumping yarns from the standard yarn market, making it harder for the market to support.</p>
<h3>Cotton Standard Decreases 1.7 Yuan</h3>
<p>The cotton standard market opened in the morning with high U.S. cotton prices, but morale was scattered and there were few buyers. Prices rose 1 to 2 jiao in various months. The opening in the afternoon was good for the first 2 or 3 rounds, but suddenly declined, and the market atmosphere became fatigued. Selling increased again, and prices fell 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, and 1.8 jiao in various months. Total transactions for the day were 41,200 bales. It was found that Xin Cheng sold 2,350 bales, Da Chang Cheng 2,450 bales, Ren Feng 1,700 bales, Geng Feng 1,600 bales, and Chang Feng 900 bales. Ji Feng bought 1,000 bales, Yu Kang 1,800 bales, Da Chang 1,650 bales, and Yi Chang 1,750 bales. Closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Cotton Standard Closing Price Increase/Decrease Balance September 19.14 Decrease 1.5 649500 June 18.40 Decrease 1.7 18800 October 19.20 1461450 July 18.52 174550 November 19.36 1445700 August 18.89 1862700 Total 298150</p>
<h3>Spot Yarn Sales Average</h3>
<p>Spot yarn sales averaged. It was found that various groups bought a total of 590 bales, with prices falling .5 jiao. The purchase amounts by group are as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong 205 Changsha 50 Sichuan 25 Nanjing 5 Niuzhuang 10 Mainland 50 Luzhou 135 Fellow traders 110</p>
<p>Cotton</p>
<p>Market drifted downwards, because the yarn market was sluggish and factory losses were significant. They would absolutely not handle high-priced raw materials. Japanese merchants also stopped buying recently. Consequently, market morale was weak. Although U.S. cotton rose, exchange rates increased and the gold market plummeted. Furthermore, prices of wheat and other goods have recently reached 20-year lows, so the cotton market will inevitably undergo a drastic change in the future.</p>
<h3>Local Cotton Decreases Another .8 Jiao</h3>
<p>The Zheng standard market opened in the morning with a sharp rise in U.S. cotton, but the market lacked new buyers. Prices increased by .05 to .1 jiao in various months. In the afternoon, news of a sharp fall in gold prices caused sudden fatigue, and prices fell .5 and .6 jiao in various months. Total transactions for the day were 80,500 loads. It was found that Xin Cheng sold 5,100 loads, Rui Da 3,200 loads, Tong Ji 1,900 loads, Chang Feng 1,300 loads, and Yi Chang 1,200 loads. Chun Ji bought 3,400 loads, Yuan Da 4,600 loads, Yuan Xing Chang 2,200 loads, and Yu Chang 1,400 loads. Closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Closing Price Increase/Decrease Balance October 4.70 Decrease .3 5121800 June 4.60 Decrease .8 47100 November 4.45 4590100 July 4.63 65115100 Total 552000 August 4.61 45167900</p>
<h3>Spot Cotton Business Stalled</h3>
<p>Chinese and foreign factories all lacked interest, because silk prices</p>
<p>were too low and raw materials were not being processed. The source was 500 bales of Yao cotton.</p>
<p>Selling Price 53.50 Yuan, Yong An Factory Bought 200 Pieces, Sent to Factory</p>
<h3>U.S. Cotton Rebounds 30 Pounds in Sound</h3>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton initially weakened due to favorable weather, but then rose due to good news from Memphis and active cloth trading. As a result, spot prices rose 30 pounds, and futures rose 27 to 32 pounds. In the Liverpool cotton market, spot prices fell 3 points, and near-term futures weakened 1 point, with far-term futures unchanged. In the Egyptian cotton spot market, prices fell 3 points. In the Bombay cotton market, prices rose due to short covering and Japanese merchant buying. As a result, prices rose by half a rupee. The original telegram is recorded below (telegram of the 19th):</p>
<p>U.S. Cotton Compared to Previous Day Equivalent in National Currency British Cotton Compared to Previous Day Equivalent in National Currency 7923 Up 27 47.10 7588 Down 151.80 1950 31 48.50 8588 Unchanged 51.80 1296 50 49.30 1588 Unchanged 51.80 1970 29 49.50 1592 Unchanged 32.20 3987 31 50.40 3595 Unchanged 52.50 5100 23 25.20 Spot 616 Down 5 54.30 Spot 93 50 47.70 Egyptian 826 573.00 Pingle 154.00 Down 0.50 31.50 Omu 190.50 0.50 380.70 White Luo River 205.00 0.50 41.60</p>
<h3>Grain Market: Futures Flour Plummets, Small Rebound</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, various months showed signs of a rebound, with quoted prices for foreign wheat in Europe</p>
<p>and the U.S. increasing from 3 to 4 jiao to 8 to 9 jiao. Due to excessive mold and rain, various places will</p>
<p>suffer from flooding. When prices were opened, market sentiment was excited. Near-term futures were better by 2 to 3 fen compared to the closing price. Customer demand was also slightly active, but factory attitudes remained unfavorable, and they continued to dump orders, which ultimately trapped the market. At the opening in the afternoon, the market for this month weakened again, because spot sales were not smooth and short positions were still plentiful, leading to a rebound. Far-term futures were relatively stable due to hedging relationships, but factory dumping continued, and large accounts also gradually sold off. The future outlook is still unfavorable, and the market is only experiencing a small rebound after a large fall. As a result, this month's prices remained unchanged, July and August prices improved by .01, September prices improved by .0125, October prices improved by .015, and November prices improved by .0125.</p>
<h3>12,000 Packages of Spot Wheat Were Opened</h3>
<p>Standard Weather Improved by 3 to 4 Fen Due to Rain</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market showed signs of stabilizing. Prices for foreign wheat rebounded</p>
<p>by 3 to 4 and 8 to 9 jiao. The rain had not stopped, and reports indicated that flooding was imminent, so market sentiment stabilized after the opening. Compared to the previous day's closing prices,</p>
<p>prices improved by 3, 4, and 5 fen. At the opening in the afternoon, market sentiment weakened slightly, because new wheat was in peak season, factory demand was not strong, and it was difficult to push prices higher. Prices gradually weakened, because supply exceeded demand. As a result, this month's price did not open. August and September prices improved by .03, October prices improved by .04, and November prices improved by .03. In the spot wheat market, trucks and boats of wheat arrived gradually, and quoted prices decreased step by step. Because quoted prices in the production areas also decreased by .1 or .2 jiao for high-quality wheat, the local environment was also very poor, so the arriving wheat was significantly reduced. The opening price for Taiping Bridge wheat was 3.72 yuan, then decreased to .765 yuan. Gaoyou wheat was 3.765 yuan, Huangqiao wheat was 3.775 yuan, then decreased to .765 yuan. Jiangbei wheat was 3.7 yuan, then decreased to .765 yuan. Nanjing wheat was 3.765 yuan, Wuhu wheat was 3.78 yuan, and Hezhou Jiangyan wheat was 3.775 yuan. Pukou wheat was 3.7 yuan, then decreased to .76 yuan. Zhitang wheat was 3.56 yuan, Penglai wheat was 3.52 yuan, then decreased to .747 yuan. Weiting wheat was 3.7 yuan, then decreased to .7645 yuan. Taipingbang wheat was 3.775 yuan, then decreased to .7 yuan. Kunshan wheat was 3.776 yuan, then decreased to .758 yuan. Taicang wheat was 3.6 yuan. A total of 12,000-plus packages were opened. Fufeng purchased over 8,000 packages, and Fuxin purchased over 4,000 packages.</p>
<h3>Chicago Wheat Rises Sharply</h3>
<p>A telegram from Monday (the 19th) stated that Chicago wheat rose sharply due to reports of spring wheat damage and large-scale buying. The trading volume for the day was 30 million bushels. Closing prices compared to the previous day were:</p>
<p>July futures 76.625 Up 2.75 September futures 78.375 Up 2.5 December futures 80.875 Up 2.625</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Markets Conclude; New Silk Comes to Market</h3>
<p>Yixing New Silk Gradually Shipped to Shanghai</p>
<p>This year's silk production in the Yixing Improved Sericulture Area is relatively abundant. Many silkworms in silkworm rearing and improvement areas are producing high-quality silk. New dried silk is being gradually shipped to Shanghai. In just over half a month, over 1,000 packages have been shipped.</p>
<h3>New Ji Li Silk is Not Cost-Effective</h3>
<p>Nanxun is the central production area for Ji Li silk. This year's spring silk harvest was abundant, and the silkworms were of high quality. The price was not high. Many silkworm farmers self-produced native silk to sell to local native silk firms for re-spinning Ji Li dried silk and large silk, which was then shipped to foreign firms for sale. South Bund native silk firms have all started purchasing. New silk arrivals are quite abundant, but unfortunately, the silk price is not low. Fine silk opens at 42.3 yuan per 100 liang, so the cost of Ji Li dried silk this year is approximately 800 yuan per package.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Silk Factories Have Thick Stock of Sichuan Silk</h3>
<p>New Sichuan silk will soon be on the market, but old silk from the production areas has not yet been cleared. Supply is not scarce, and silk costs are not low. Although sales in Europe improved slightly in the past month, silk prices are not high. Shanghai silk factories have a total stock of 2,200 to 2,300 packages of iron-machine, wood-machine, Yangfan small vehicle, and other Sichuan factory silk, as well as yellow silk.</p>
<h3>Foreign Silk Sales Continue to be Subdued</h3>
<p>Yesterday, silk prices in New York and Yokohama were generally stable, but the price of Lyons Chinese silk fell by 2-3 francs per kilogram. Although there were transfers of European and American silk to Shanghai, the prices all fell. Chinese silk merchants have a firm attitude and will not sell at slightly lower prices. Market sentiment is subdued. Only 20 packages of Shanghai white factory silk were sold, and prices remained stable.</p>
<h3>Two Heartbreaking Matters</h3>
<p>— Geng</p>
<p>Just the day before, I saw the news in the newspaper: "Japanese Students Flock to the Northeast to Conduct Exploratory Surveys" (a piece of news seen many times before). The very next day, the large headline "Students Studying in Japan Forced to Return Home" glaringly leapt into view, piercing my heart. It truly infuriates me.</p>
<p>The content regarding being forced to return home briefly stated that, being in a foreign land, and thinking of the Japanese army attacking our homeland, massacring our compatriots, bombarding our cities, and refugees everywhere, they formed a refugee relief association. Unexpectedly, this was met with jealousy from the Japanese authorities. More than forty people have been arrested one after another, severely interrogated and beaten, with some dying from their injuries. Although some were released, they were subsequently forced to return home, it is said.</p>
<p>The content regarding exploratory surveys briefly stated that, "After the ceasefire in North China, various parts of Japan are vying to organize Manchurian study groups, emerging like a spring. Railways and ships used by these groups are granted free and preferential treatment. The number of registered study groups has reached 87,000, with over 3.5 million people. Students account for the majority. There are so-called student exploration teams, with 8,000 members, divided into economics, geographical surveying, mining, forestry, and other surveys. They will depart for the Northeast on July 1st, it is said."</p>
<p>When we compare the above two news items, those who are numb and have no heart, as well as the traitors who sell out their country and recognize the enemy as their father, aside, even those who usually act as if nothing matters will find it difficult to pretend to be deaf and dumb. Even third parties in distant Europe and the West, who possess some human sympathy, will surely feel indignant about this. How much more should the so-called countrymen? How much more should the so-called compatriots? I think that at the very least, we should feel that the former is a page in our history of heartbreak, and precisely a scene of Japanese triumph. The latter is the beginning of the Japanese thorough invasion of the Northeast, and precisely the creation of a base for our four lost provinces, from which it will be impossible to recover. Our students studying abroad are students who used silver to exchange for gold coins to study. Usually, they are given the same treatment as inferior people. When something happens, they are cruelly whipped back batch after batch, each one looking disheveled and completely battered. The exploration groups of the Japanese are exploration groups that come empty-handed to survey our treasure troves. They come and go freely, as if entering an uninhabited land, not to mention (I fear this is not only the case in the Northeast at this time) that as they enter and exit, there are also traitors kneeling to welcome and send them off, so that the tens of thousands of angel-like honored guests can all return laden with riches, and those who stay can choose the fattest and devour, strutting and acting arrogantly. Alas, in this world, is there any event that surpasses this as a painful historical event, both in ancient and modern times!</p>
<h3>The Night Before Winning the Aviation Prize</h3>
<p>— Piao Ping</p>
<p>Feeling around in my pockets, they were completely empty, without a penny. I was so anxious that my eyes blurred and smoke came out of my seven orifices. I opened the newspaper and saw that the winner of the aviation first prize was Wang Piaoping. This made me jump for joy, and so I began to calculate on the abacus, how to use these silver coins, making me restless and unable to eat or drink. I was truly like a Wuxi person pacing around the tip of Jiangjian Mountain.</p>
<p>The first question, of course, was to hire a bodyguard, because now is not like before. Having tens of thousands of coins, growing a mustache, and looking like a wealthy man, the heroes of the Jianghu are bound to plot against me. If something goes wrong, that's no joke. So, after careful consideration, this bodyguard is absolutely necessary. However, his martial arts must be superb, with all eighteen martial arts being mastered, and his shooting skills must be able to hit the bullseye from a hundred paces. In this way, I can walk proudly without worrying about external threats. I have decided that tomorrow I will write a letter to a friend of a tycoon to hire a famous镖師 (bodyguard master).</p>
<p>Having a镖師 but still living in a pigeon-cage-like pavilion seems inappropriate, so a Western-style house must be built. Pavilions and towers, everything should be available. Winding paths and small bridges, all equipment should be complete. As for artificial mountains and exotic flowers, they should be 多　　致 (elaborate). But if outsiders intrude to ask about ginseng, . The third question is naturally buying a car. If I buy, I will buy two. One is for my own transportation, and the other is for my wife, so she can use it to go to the dance hall or movie theater every day. I will spare no expense to find beautiful women, those with beautiful faces and graceful figures, to fill the back room. Thus, embracing wives and concubines, winking and flirting, eating Western food, and going to dance halls is truly exhilarating. At night, playing mahjong, and when happy, why not visit the brothels? As for treating maids and servants, naturally be more strict. If anyone dares to say no, immediately whip them with a rattan cane.</p>
<p>I remember before winning the prize, being a poor scholar, I went to the homes of the wealthy to solicit donations, and was always met with closed doors and scorned. Even worse, I was driven out by their wolf-like gatekeepers. Now that I am suddenly rich, I must show off for a while. If these rich people come to bother me, I will not give them a penny, and I will angrily curse their doorsteps to vent my anger.</p>
<p>In fact, as a newly rich man, I should prepare more Western suits to enhance my dignity, and buy cosmetics in bulk. Combing my hair neatly, applying half a pound or eight ounces of scented hair oil, making it shine like a mirror. With a flower bow tie, black leather shoes, and a completely new outfit, wearing glasses on the bridge of my nose, I will be elegant. Which young woman would not be attracted to me? Haha, today's me has almost forgotten yesterday's me.</p>
<p>But the poor friends from before, don't even think about talking to them, I have cut off ties with all of them. Whoever is so ignorant and comes to nag, don't blame me for being ungrateful, or I will severely reprimand them, or slap them in the face. Anyway, with money, there is nothing to fear. If the judge wants to be fair, I will secretly give him a thousand or five hundred, and naturally, everything will be peaceful. What can those poor scholars do to me?</p>
<p>But in these few days, the situation in Beiping and Tianjin is very urgent. If the Japanese really invade, even though Jiangnan is a prosperous world, I'm afraid it won't be safe. I should buy a airplane, and fly to foreign land. Build a small villa there, and live wild, even if my country falls, it won't concern me. In the end, I woke up, and it was all a dream, having wasted so much thought. (Move the reward to help purchase children's airplane)</p>
<h3>The Pursuit of Money</h3>
<p>— Jack</p>
<p>Walking out the door and looking at the street, people are so busy and rushing. Trolleys carry loads of people back and forth. Cars, rickshaws, and X are all speeding by. Going back and forth like shuttles. I wonder what they are busy with? It's like this every day, every year, without a moment of pause.</p>
<p>Does anyone say that they are not doing for "money"? When it comes to this word "money," it has the same mystery and structure as the word "love" that Mr. Shen Min spoke of. But "money" is an all-powerful thing! It wields great authority in the universe, so people are constantly pursuing it, obsessed with it, and using its great authority in society. It can make people happy! It can also bring people joy! Things that people can't do, it can do for you. Things that can't be handled well, it can also handle well for you! Internationally, having it can make a country strong. In a family, having it can create reunion. For an individual, having it allows you to come and go freely as you please. Conversely, without it internationally, you will be bullied. In a family, without it, even if you are husband and wife, father and son, you will be separated. For an individual, without it, you have no way forward. So it is very straightforward, very gentle and considerate, and very benevolent. But it is also very snobbish, very ruthless and violent, and very impolite!</p>
<p>"Money" has great magic power in society. Anyone who has it can give birth to children and manipulate everything. If you are not good at handling it, it will reverse you. So people desperately pursue it.</p>
<p>Some people commit suicide because they are unsuccessful in their pursuit. Some young people pursue it with too much ambition, and they take risks. Even more than that, there are those who fight amongst themselves. This is exactly what is called "wanting money more than life." In short, they are all pursuing the symbol of "money"!</p>
<p>The structure of this word "money" means that two "spears" are watching a piece of gold. You want it, and I want to take it, but there is only one piece of gold, not two. You can't take it, and I can't take it either. It must be that when you want to take it, or I want to take it, it is determined that there will be fighting to start a war! So when it comes to wanting "money," it is impossible to avoid fighting. Internationally, the pursuit of "money" leads to great wars, even to the destruction of countries. Domestically, the pursuit of "money" leads to small wars, almost wiping out races. (This... the race I'm talking about is not ethnicity, but the human race, but now it's almost ethnicity too.) A family fights over "money," breaking the father's head. An individual pursues "money" and takes a knife to kill people. Which day do we not see the gloomy signs caused by the pursuit of "money"?</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "People can't do without money, and birds can't fly without wings!" Its meaning expresses that with "money," you can go anywhere, and without "money," it's as if you have no feet and can't move.</p>
<p>So "money" is essential. If you don't fight for it, who will give it to you?</p>
<p>"No, my argument is to want it without fighting, to fight without hitting, which is the only morality for wanting 'money.'"</p>
<h3>Insult</h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>"Damn it! You..."</p>
<p>After being cursed, his fist immediately flew towards my chest!</p>
<p>My mind went into a daze.</p>
<p>Of course, what could I say? I could only leave, to avoid the violence.</p>
<p>At this moment, the world was no longer as peaceful as it was in the morning.</p>
<p>Insult, violence, submission... all surged around me. I was lost on the road.</p>
<p>I tried my best to calm my mind, but I could never forget this insult, cursing, and punch. Alas! Friends! In reality, my chest was hurting... of course, how could I forget?!</p>
<p>As I walked to the dock, my heart was trembling. I thought, maybe I'll be lucky this time?</p>
<p>There was no way, I had to bite the bullet and walk to the ticket booth. That ticket collector! That bastard, looked me up and down.</p>
<p>"Sir, I'm sorry, I don't have any money this time," I humbly pleaded.</p>
<p>"What? No money? That won't do!"</p>
<p>"Alas! Sir! I really don't have money," I continued to plead.</p>
<p>Pleading, in a world that was no longer as peaceful as it was in the morning! That won't do!</p>
<p>People who bought tickets and people who went up with briefcases cast contemptuous glances at me. They had a mindset of watching the drama, waiting for the end of this matter, and then taking it as conversation material to talk about during their ferry trip.</p>
<p>My face was already very thick, and I was not afraid of the contempt that people gave me. In order to cross the river, I could only beg them.</p>
<p>However, it was no use, still no use! A cold face, I had already seen five.</p>
<p>A gentleman in a suit walked past, without asking. People who were not involved also came to watch this live drama. What could I do? I had no money, no. The weak were insulted and bullied.</p>
<p>I walked away like a little lamb. I couldn't resist, but I couldn't help but feel resentful.</p>
<p>"Hmph! Can't you cross the river without money?"</p>
<p>"What? You..."</p>
<p>Friends! The ticket collector threw a punch.</p>
<p>Hmph! A punch, a flying punch! I am in my twenties, and this is the first time I have suffered such a thing! An insult!</p>
<p>What should I do? An insult, leave!</p>
<p>Walking on the street, I didn't want to think about these things anymore! A punch, what does that mean to us?! Our bones are born to be beaten! But, we can't be destroyed! The more we are oppressed, the more we resist. However, I feel sorry for the guy who hit me! In society, what does he count for? He is also being insulted! He came to insult me, that's because he was sold himself. My soul was not insulted! I still have my value. Alas! My chest, still! Hurts...</p>
<h3>Wireless Radio is a Tool for National Subjugation</h3>
<p>— Jian Yi</p>
<p>Readers must find this topic very strange, because wireless radio is the latest crystallization of modern material civilization and scientific advancement. Thanks to the invention of wireless radio, people have received a few benefits. Every country relies on it as a tool for military and transportation purposes. How can it be said that it is a tool for national subjugation? Furthermore, the wireless radio industries of European and American countries are more developed than those of China. How come they are not subjugated, but instead become increasingly prosperous and strong? Why does it become a tool for national subjugation when it comes to China?</p>
<p>Everything has both good and bad aspects. For example, modern scientific inventions, on the one hand, of course, the more developed science is, the more civilized the material is, and the more people enjoy. But from the bad side, the more developed the science, the more convenient it is to kill, and the more barbaric mankind becomes. Wireless radio is the same. If it is used well, it will become increasingly prosperous and strong. If it is not used well, it will be a tool for national subjugation.</p>
<p>In European and American countries, almost every family has a wireless radio installation. Their purpose is to make the whole country well-informed, so when there are important current affairs, they are broadcasted by radio stations, and in an instant, the people of the whole country know about it. The second is to invite celebrities to give lectures, so that people can increase their knowledge. Entertainment is the least noticed purpose. But China is just the opposite. Entertainment is the most important purpose. Every day, what is broadcast is nothing more than storytelling, local operas, humorous dialogues, ditties, and lyrics of Chinese and Western dramas, etc., programs that make people's will depressed and degraded. As for celebrity lectures or reports on important current affairs, they are rarely heard!</p>
<p>Now, most of the bourgeoisie and people of leisure have wireless radio installations, because in the past, they had to go out to enjoy visual and auditory entertainment. Now, as long as they have wireless radio, they don't even have to leave the house to get all kinds of entertainment. So, with a machine in their ears, all thoughts are empty. They spend the day at home with their wives and concubines, listening to wireless radio, indulging in pleasure, completely exposing the inferior nature of living in a drunken dream. The national crisis is not even a shadow in their minds! Alas! Fortunately, China still cannot equip everyone with wireless radio, otherwise everyone will be intoxicated in the atmosphere of entertainment.

<h3>Shop Assistant Correspondence</h3>
<p>Where to Go?</p>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>You are at the forefront of knowledge and a respected teacher to us. I admire and respect you very much. I have a pressing personal matter that I have wanted to ask you about for a long time.</p>
<p>I am afraid that my knowledge is too poor for you to read, but if I don't ask you, no one will solve it for me. Today, I mustered up all my courage and wrote my problem and situation into this letter, hoping that you will sympathize with me. I am a poor person who cannot return home. I used to teach in a rural elementary school for two years. Because of rural economic bankruptcy and the rampant bandits and communists, I left my loving hometown in the spring of the year before last and came to this prosperous sea to make a living. Soon after, I was introduced by a friend to work in an ordnance factory. Who knew that my fate was so bad? Before a year had passed, the "January 28th Incident" occurred, and my rice bowl was broken.</p>
<p>At that time, I couldn't go back to the countryside, so I had to look for work everywhere. Alas, in this Shanghai where there are too many talents, I was disappointed. Since then I led an unemployed life. At that time, I had a relative who opened a small printing shop here. Seeing that I was homeless, he asked me to help him. In reality, his shop did not need anyone, and I am an amateur. So my living expenses are only my pocket money. At that time, it was the time of the unemployment panic, so I had to agree. In this year or so, I have worked hard and struggled, but now there is no reason at all, which makes me feel discouraged, negative, and disgusted with the world. Time flies, and it's almost been two years. Although my relative has nothing to say, Chang'an is a good place, but it is not a place to live for long. I have to find a way to develop my future. Now I have two paths, written below, and I sincerely ask you to choose one for me!</p>
<p>㈠ When I worked in the ordnance factory, I saved the wages I earned with my blood and sweat, eating frugally and using frugally. This year, with principal and interest, it is probably about one hundred yuan. I want to use it as the basic capital to do some small business that is slightly developed and beneficial to society. I don't know what kind of business is good to do?</p>
<p>㈡ I have been entrusted to find work everywhere during this difficult period. I have a cousin who serves in the staff office of a certain military. He recently sent a letter asking me to work there. Any document, sergeant, can be arranged, but the salary, including food expenses, is only five or six yuan a month. I want to go now, but I am afraid that my parents will be worried, because the army is so violent! I am also afraid that my knowledge will not be able to handle it. Sir, do you think my writing and knowledge are able to handle it? Is my future from now on developed? Sir, you have the honor of solving all difficulties, and I think you will be able to solve my problem. Yours respectfully, Gu Jinglun.</p>
<p>Editor's note: In this capitalist world that has already materialized, our economically backward country is very pitiful. Generally, people called capitalists, although on the one hand, because they cannot defeat foreign capitalists, and they are falling one by one, they are very capable of using the "long sleeves are good at dancing" policy for the poor people in the country, so that you have no way to go. It seems that they will not stop until they are completely exhausted! You want to use your accumulated one hundred yuan as a fund to start your own business. Not that we want to spoil your fun, but we advise you not to. What can this small amount do? And you still want to be "relatively developed" and beneficial to society, that is really blind. You should still find something to do casually, get the dry and eat the wet. This one hundred yuan should be kept as a subsidy in case of unemployment. It is not worth throwing it away in vain.</p>
<p>As for going to the army to be a clerk, according to your letter, your writing and knowledge are still okay. A high-level position cannot be guaranteed, but you can definitely handle a sergeant's secretary. Logically speaking, military life is very interesting and should be more meaningful. Getting a way out from this is very possible. However, the Chinese army cannot be discussed in general. There are certainly those that are meaningful and for the country and the people, but there are also many disguised robbers. We would rather starve to death than be robbers. So your second path, in principle, is good, but you should consider the content of this army.</p>
<p>If the result of the consideration is that you cannot go, then wait for an opportunity. Fortunately, your relatives have nothing to say! One's life certainly cannot be wasted, but the result of "hard work" and "impatience" may not only fail to progress, but may also regress.</p>

<h3>Under the Red and Green Lights (6)</h3>
<p>— Xi Lin</p>
<p>"Scary?" This was a voice from the room, clear and pleasant.</p>
<p>The door was half-open, just enough for his eyes to see the figure of a glamorous woman lounging on the sofa, a book with a white cover and a blood-red wave pattern in her hand. "Excuse me, is a Mr. here? I live in the pavilion and wanted to ask for Mr. Ji." he</p>
<p>gestured awkwardly.</p>
<p>"Oh, Mr. Li?" Is there anything I can help you with? Our Mr. Yang is out, but no worries, please come in!"</p>
<p>City women were accustomed to socializing and were quick-witted. Shi Qiao was embarrassed by this generous and unexpectedly warm tone. He remained standing by the threshold, not daring to enter. The third concubine stood up, not even calling Ah Zhen to bring tea and cigarettes. Instead, she closed the door halfway, squeezing Shi Qiao inside. She already knew Shi Qiao's intentions, so she spoke first...</p>
<p>"I'm truly sorry! Luckily, these two large rooms are enough for us. The one in the back is the living room. Ah Zhen!! My eldest sister has already set up house in that small room behind the stairs! Fighting is so annoying, isn't it, Mr. Li?" She tilted her head, not expecting an answer, but merely displaying one of her practiced alluring charms. In reality, Shi Qiao, sitting in this soft and plush bedroom, breathing in the rich air perfumed by the beautiful woman, had long lost control. His troubled heart was gradually melting away, and Shi Qiao forgot what he wanted to say, simply staring blankly at the lake-colored curtains. Suddenly, a cigarette touched his hand, and the other hand offering the cigarette, with its snake-like, smooth, and cold skin, sent a shiver down his spine.</p>
<p>(5) How distant this is from beauty!</p>
<p>Today, the war was even more intense. All of Shanghai was shaking, like a broken ship in a storm. The row of plane trees in front of the house was newly covered with a layer of ash from fires in Zhabei. With a gust of wind, this ash often blurred the eyes of passersby.</p>
<p>Li Halov went out to buy groceries. Meizi sat alone on the third stone step of the small garden in front of the door, bathing in the not-so-bright sunlight filtered through the mist. The distant thunder-like sound of cannons constantly reminded her of the horrors of the Russo-Japanese War. She truly couldn't understand why humans wage war. What good does war do? Sacrificing countless lives to gain the so-called glory of the Yamato spirit, yet wasn't she, a daughter of the Yamato spirit, equally adrift at the ends of the earth! She unintentionally whispered to herself, "Alas, Li Halov's tsar!"</p>
<p>The sound of hurried footsteps of several young men approached on the quiet street. Full of life, they went west past the front of the house. Suddenly, one of the tall men jokingly gave her a mock military salute and shouted "Ha!" before passing by. It was Li Shi Qiao, obviously busy with some intense work.</p>
<p>!! Was he also going to participate in the front line, Meizi wondered. She originally abhorred war, any war, but she seemed to have a natural sympathy for China's fight for its own breath. Unfortunately, she only had intellectual sympathy and could not find a clear reason.</p>

<p>Movie Supplement</p>
<h3>Mr. Big Nose Talks Extensively About Beauty Techniques</h3>
<p>— Hua Ming</p>
<p>Ugly men can't get girlfriends, but makeup can save them from misfortune. Mr. Big Nose, Jimmy Durante, is known for his humor. After the release of "The Professor" starring him and the cold-faced comedian, Buster Keaton, his fame for humor grew even more. Recently, every time Jimmy goes to MGM Studios, he makes sure to first go to the makeup room, close the windows tightly, and stay inside for more than half an hour. When he opens the door, his face is covered in powder, a fragrant scent fills the air, and his hair is smooth, obviously covered in oil. Especially interesting is his naturally unparalleled big nose, with its large pores filled with powder. The mischievous and famous prankster, Jackie Cooper, arrived at MGM Studios early one morning and quietly hid in the makeup room. Jimmy arrived at the studio, swaggered into the makeup room, and began to apply powder and rouge to his face in front of the mirror. Jackie Cooper saw everything and mischievously took a picture to show everyone. As a result, Hollywood gossiped about Mr. Big Nose.</p>
<p>However, Jimmy's recent efforts in makeup have been particularly diligent, and many people have inquired about why he is emulating the tricks of young girls. An employee at MGM Studios said that he uses a box of fragrant powder every two days. They also spoke to Jimmy, but Jimmy calmly explained his reason for applying makeup and strongly encouraged men to wear makeup.</p>
<p>Jimmy said, "In Hollywood, a man who doesn't have several girlfriends will be laughed at. But after I came to Hollywood, no woman ever said she wanted to be my friend. I look at others, like Clark Gable, Cary Grant, Gary Cooper, etc. They always have girlfriends when they go out. I was a little baffled. Among my MGM colleagues, there are many female stars, but none of them would befriend me. Recently, I went back and asked my wife, and she said that my nose was too shiny and ugly, and no girl would want to be friends with me. From that point on, I realized that ugly men can't get girlfriends, and they must find a way to hide their ugly faces."</p>
<p>"Later, I thought of a brilliant way, which is to use makeup to hide my ugliness. I'm afraid of my wife at home, so I only implement my plan when I get to the company. Sure enough, my method is extraordinarily effective. Now I already have three girlfriends."</p>
<h3>Two Anecdotes from "Little Toys"</h3>
<p>(1) Two Laughable Drenched Dogs</p>
<p>In the movie "Little Toys," which is currently being filmed by Lianhua No. 2 Factory, in addition to people, there are also pigs, sheep, chickens, ducks, and dogs. However, pigs, sheep, chickens, and ducks have no roles, only dogs need to perform several shots alone. A few days ago, they were filming an exterior scene of the slum where Mrs. Ye lived after fleeing the war to Shanghai. The dog was supposed to run across a narrow wooden bridge. The dog director, Han Langan, was directing it. The dog cautiously walked onto the bridge, looking very timid. As everyone watched, with a "plump" sound, it fell into the river. Han Langan, seeing his beloved dog falling into the water,</p>
<p>fearing it would drown, shouted "Lai Fu"</p>
<p>(the dog's name) and jumped into the river. By the time Lai Fu was rescued, the drenched dog was soaked all over, and the dog director, Han Langan, was in the same state, looking quite comparable.</p>
<p>(2) Toilet in front of Ruan Lingyu</p>
<p>A few days ago, Lianhua No. 2 Factory was filming scene fifteen of "Little Toys," the Ye family scene. One of the close-ups was of Mrs. Ye (played by Ruan Lingyu) holding her nose while eating fried stinky tofu. Ruan Lingyu's performance already made people want to burst into laughter, but after Director Sun (Yu) shouted "Out," the onlookers burst into even greater laughter. Some people were confused. After careful observation, they realized it was a funny thing. It turned out that someone had taken advantage of the situation and placed a small toy toilet in front of Ruan Lingyu. So she ended up eating stinky tofu in front of a toilet, doubly stinky.</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3>Review of "A Modern Woman"</h3>
<p>— Shi Zeyong</p>
<p>In a large advertisement, it told me that the screenwriter and star of a movie was Ms. Ai Xia. This indeed opened a new era in the Chinese film scene where female stars took on the role of screenwriter and lead actress! Therefore, I made a special trip to the Central Grand Theater to admire Ms. Ai Xia's masterpiece, "A Modern Woman."</p>
<p>The meaning of this movie is to satirize modern women in general. It uses the character of Tao Tao, a female employee of a real estate company, to expose as much as possible the modern illnesses and vanity of women in general. It also gives a strong warning to young people who blindly pursue free love.</p>
<p>The meaning of this movie is very correct. But there are a few minor issues that can be discussed. Tao Tao is just a female employee of a real estate company. Her monthly salary, at most, is only seventy yuan. (This was confirmed by Yu Leng when he was doing accounting.) Later, even after the manager added thirty yuan, it was only about one hundred yuan a month. But her residence is decorated so luxuriously. Moreover, she lives alone, which shouldn't be so extravagant. And after she loses her job, she shows signs of financial distress, which shows that she has never been wealthy. A man who is qualified to be an editor, I think Yu Leng's knowledge must be very good. But I saw on the screen that he was deceiving his wife and spending all day having fun with Tao Tao. How could someone who reads and understands principles be so confused? Afterwards, Tao Tao's crime and his wife's divorce, at this time, these two major blows and stimulations should have made him suddenly realize the error of his ways. But no, he indulges in gambling, women, and wild dancing. As a result, he causes the crime. So these points seem to be errors that an educated person shouldn't have. What does Ms. Ai Xia think?</p>
<p>This movie also has good points. For example, the use of several clever shots is indeed commendable. There are also several good small interjections. For example, when Yu Leng first arrives at Tao Tao's house, Tao Tao covers Yu Leng's eyes with her hands, followed by several sweet kisses, which are very passionate and intense. Also, Tao Tao picks up the photo of Yu Leng's wife, Yu Ru, and draws eyebrows and a mustache on it, vividly portraying a unrestrained woman who doesn't accept restraint. Also, Yu Leng lies to his wife that he is participating in the League of Nations Investigation Team, which is very humorous and funny on paper. These points are also worth praising. As for the actors' expressions, Ms. Ai Xia's is very consistent with her identity and the most successful. But the expressions in several kissing scenes seem too exaggerated. As for Sun Min? Some scenes are too dull. For example, the expression of love for Tao Tao seems to lack passion. Small actions are still successful. Compared to "Spring Water Love," it seems to be progressing! As for Xu Xinyuan's expression, it is very profound, but she doesn't appear much! Also, Ms. Tang Yueqing's Wang Anlin is also acceptable. The rest of the supporting roles are also appropriate.</p>
<h3>Review of "A Modern Woman"</h3>
<p>— Xiao Yun</p>
<p>In this rapidly changing modern society, young people are tempted by sensory pleasures and often have strong emotional impulses. But they don't have strong reason and often can't restrain their desires. As a result, many new tragedies are added to society. Their weaknesses should be remedied, and they need guidance when they go astray. "A Modern Woman" is a film that grabs this theme. But it has not fulfilled its due responsibility, because the negative aspects are really overdone, too distorted and heavy!</p>
<p>The director's technique sometimes shows his experience,</p>
<p>But the entire plot is loose and cannot keep the audience's attention. The development on the screen is obviously not full enough. But the subtitles help a lot. The shots are very active, and the lighting is still soft. The garden scene is quite beautiful. The scenery in Tao Tao's house is very beautiful, but it is too grand. The walls in the prison are too obviously "fake"!</p>
<p>The most effort in acting is Ai Xia's, which is much more advanced than "Old Hatred New Love." Sun Min acts too sadly, which is too much and seems to be regressing. Xie Yunfang only knows how to be stiff all the time, missing many good opportunities to perform, which is a pity! Tang Yueqing is average, Xu Xinyuan is very good.</p>
<p>There are also a few small flaws in the film that seem to need to be discussed.</p>
<p>(1) When Wu Ru leaves, she takes the child with her. Later, at the lawyer's office, the child is not seen again. How it was dealt with during the divorce and what will happen to it in the future are not explained clearly.</p>
<p>(2) Yu Ru's letter to Yu Leng says, "Xiao Bao often says, why doesn't Daddy come home?" Xiao Bao is only a few months old in the play, how can he speak?</p>
<p>(3) Yu Leng's life after his downfall is too brief. How he committed the crime is not easy to understand.</p>
<p>(4) Is there too little order and dignity in the courtroom? Can the defendant move freely and directly question without active intervention?</p>
<h3>Watching "A Modern Woman"</h3>
<p>— Yu Jiaqing</p>
<p>In domestic films, it is rare for the screenwriter and lead actor to be the same person, especially a female star. But our Little Pigeon (Ai Xia) was able to break this example.</p>
<p>The plot is as follows: It tells the story of a female employee, Tao Tao, who loves a journalist, Yu Leng. On one hand, she spends her days wandering around parks with him, playing golf, and dancing. On the other hand, she refuses the love of Shi Fanghua, the manager of her company. The manager hates her and fires her. Because Yu Leng neglects his duties, the newspaper also terminates his job. Because Tao Tao does something that loses her personality, steals a four thousand yuan check from Shi Fanghua, and is accused by Fanghua in court, she finally experiences prison life. A year later, Tao Tao is released from prison. She is persuaded by her friends, she realizes the error of her ways, and she goes on the bright path.</p>
<p>The plot is not very intense. It only tells us the close relationship between "love" and "money." The so-called yearning for love and the echo of the soul in the entire film are only "kisses."</p>
<p>The director is more successful than in "Pipa Spring Complaint." He also has special achievements in technique, but there are always some minor flaws. For example, the layout in the courtroom is too three-dimensional. Tao Tao's debate in the courtroom is a bit too presumptuous.</p>
<p>The actress Ai Xia is too enthusiastic and romantic in the first half, and her expression is natural and realistic in the second half, especially in the courtroom and in prison. Sun Min is too weak. Xu Xinyuan is still up to the job. The rest of the actors are average.</p>
<p>Photography, lighting, and angles are all clearly and appropriately arranged.</p>
<h3>Movie Novel Reunion in Vienna (8)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Zi Gui</p>
<p>(Note) Yesterday's publication was the eighth paragraph, which should have been after today's publication. This is hereby corrected.</p>
<p>Rudolph said, "You have to be careful, don't make me angry. You know that we all suffer from a bout of rage in our family, and it is often unstoppable once it erupts. Of course, I don't want to break your pretty nose or knock out one or two of your teeth and send you back to your husband."</p>
<p>Elena stared at him and said incredulously, "This is really strange. After ten years of exile and suffering so much humiliation and poverty, do you still think that Franz Josef is still the Emperor in Schönbrunn Palace?"</p>
<p>"No, sometimes I feel that times have changed, but when I see you still so gorgeous, I believe that no revolution has taken place in Austria." Rudolph said, walked closer to Elena, wanting to kiss her. But she suddenly rebelled and told him not to come near her. He told her to drink some champagne to cheer up, but she didn't drink it either. And she told him to go to the dining hall and meet her family, but he wouldn't go either. He said that he came to Vienna this time specifically to see her, not to see those old antiques. Later, Elena changed her strategy and praised him. She said, "Why not let them see that you are still so young and handsome? And when you wear this white military uniform with many medals, it will simply make them happy to death!"</p>
<p>Sure enough, Rudolph was very happy to agree to let them see him when he heard Elena's compliment. But he went out for a while and came back. He continued to say words of love to Elena, wanting to arouse her old feelings, but Elena always refused. Later, Rudolph wanted her to go into the bedroom, but she didn't agree. He kissed her all over frantically, her throat, her shoulders, her arms, etc., shouting in his mouth, "Elena, if you could know how much I can't bear to part with you, how I think of you day and night, never forgetting you, your image will always exist in my heart, comforting me, encouraging me, and making me admire..."</p>
<p>"I am different now than before," Elena said, breaking free from his embrace and standing up.</p>
<p>"I don't believe it," Rudolph said.</p>
<p>"That's because you refuse to acknowledge the most important fact, which is that I'm already married and I love him very much."</p>
<p>"Don't make me laugh," he said, walking closer and embracing her again. He said, "We don't need to argue anymore, let's relive the old dream. Let's taste the taste of life again." He hugged her tightly and kissed her eyes, her mouth, and her throat like mad. She did not resist or react. (To be continued)</p>
