<h3 id="c48">蘇日僞之鐵路糾紛晦 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>（一）中東鐵路問題</p>
<p>日本發動九一八事變之後。即進而謀襲北滿。其侵襲北滿之陰謀。第一步使與我國隔絶。第二步延長日本軍權之行使。第三步奪取吉黑之行政權。最後乃攫取中東鐵路爲己有。使海參威成爲死港。日本帝國主義遂得在東北獨步。</p>
<p>蘇聯於此。早巳認定日本之陰謀。必將逐步實現。而又正當五年計劃推行之際。殊不願對外有激烈之行動。以故哈爾濱長春間。雖瀕傳軍事不祥之惡耗。而莫斯科與東京間。仍交歡如故也。然而蘇聯之遠東軍事當局固主戰者。中東路赤俄人員。又皆忠於其祖國。故雖一面保持和平。應付日本軍閥。他一面則力謀所以自全。於是中東路車輛之扣往西比利亞者。計有機頭八十三輛。貨車三千二百輛。客車一百九十輛。中東路遂陷於週轉不靈運用失次之狀態。日本所立之傀儡。乃奉武藤信義（日本關東軍司令）之命。向蘇聯抗議交還車輛。同時即封銷滿洲里。因是蘇聯直接遂與傀儡發生衝突。間接亦與日本加深裂痕。</p>
<p>中東路竣工於一九○二年十二月。正式開始營業於一九○三年七月一日。自俄國大革命後。經一九二四年﹁中俄協定﹂及﹁奉俄協定。﹂該鐵路遂純然成爲中蘇兩國合辦之商業機關。其營業路線。計一千七百二十一公里。丨丨哈爾濱到長春二百四十公里哈爾濱至滿洲里九百三十五公里。哈爾濱至緩芬河五百四十六公里丨丨軌道闊五英尺。共有機車五百輛。客車六百○八輛。貨車九千一百四十九輛。投資總額约計四億二千萬金盧布。中蘇之間。設使能維持良好之友誼關係。則此一路線。足以有助於黑河流域之開發。使關内移民多得便利。而洮昻路亦足疏暢其間。勾通三省。接連關内。正大有作爲。惜乎東北當局。措置乖方。九一八事機發生。應變無術。遂致三省坐失。中東路利益。亦歸烏有。前者蘇聯與日本之對立。雖不免日趨尖銳。然尚有我國介乎其間以爲緩衝。尚可减少東三省火藥庫之爆炸性。</p>
<p>（二）日本進攻之用意</p>
<p>頃者我國旣失東北領土主權。東三省之爲世界火藥庫。益見明顯。日本之侵略滿洲。雖以防止﹁赤化﹂號召當世。而列國又復出其全力。以防止中日問之正面戰爭。日本之增加爆炸藥於此火藥庫中。則其爆發。勢更難免。</p>
<p>日本在侵略熱河之前。即巳積極準備。欲把持東北之交通。尤爲顯然。南滿鐵道增資至八億。東三省境内各鐵道。皆收諸滿鐵掌握。其非公式提議收買中東路者巳數次矣。當時蘇聯方面。均默置不理。而彼遂進行其抵制之策。</p>
<p>第一、於最短期内。丨今年六月以前。完成吉會鐵路。使吉林南部一切農産物品。皆自吉會路流出。於朝鮮之淸津出口。以控制海參威。同時更進行延吉至海林。海林至三姓新鐵路之建築。直貫吉林南北。使中東路東斷。未來之開發。盡歸日人之手。</p>
<p>第二、聯絡齊齊哈爾至克山鐵路。與洮昻鐵路經四洮路以接南滿。則興安嶺以東呼蘭以西之物産。盡爲大連所吸收。</p>
<p>中東路經此兩路之衝擊。其經濟上價值。當然低落。海參威之出。路。亦必爲大連與淸津所刧持。日本帝國主義者。遂得而發揮其獨占本能。遂其侵吞東北之野心矣。</p>
<p>殊不料事機之急迫。有出乎意計之外者。美國如不激劇爆發金融恐慌。則美蘇復交。或可早日實現。日本對蘇之敵對行爲。亦將延緩。近者英蘇關係。因六工程司之被捕。益趨惡化。大有斷絶國交之趨勢。日本爲見好於英帝國。切斷美蘇關聯起見。乃不能不運用其外交手腕。表示其有封鎖蘇聯之誠心。爲資本主義各國作前衛。故大張旗鼓。宣傳蘇聯備戰。并將以武力封銷滿洲里。甚至進一步以武力取中東路。而蘇聯方面除對交還車輛有所表示外。均甚沉默。此又何故耶。蓋亦深知日本之烟幕作用耳。吾人不觀乎東京尚在極力交歡蘇聯乎。而出面與蘇聯爭執者。非日本而爲日本所製造之滿洲僞國。縱不幸而閙成僵局。日本儘有轉旋之餘地。甚至自認調解。亦無不可。以故日蘇戰爭。雖終不可免。但在目前。則爲事勢所限。最短時期中亦僅止於外交上之衝突而已。</p>

<p>經首都中央研究院試騐之結果</p>
<p>亟合軍事上傳令且較密電爲佳</p>
<p>物理研究所派員來滬親加試騐</p>
<p>吳淞國立同濟大學學生王輔世君、近發明私密無綫電話一種、經敎育部長朱家驊·電政司長顔任光兩氏、與國防設計會接洽、在中央研究院試騐結果、認爲處此　難聲中、亟合軍事上一切發號施令之用、且較諸現時所用之軍事密碼電報、尤爲秘密臻善、華東社記者昨特趨車至該校訪問王氏、承告以發明經過等情、兹錄如下、</p>
<h3 id="c129">發明動機 <a href="#c129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>據王氏談、數年前余鑒於軍事電報、雖用密碼、但有時常易推測、且密碼簿旦遺失、則危險更甚、斯時余腦海中、卽有研究無線電話之思索、惟初時非常複雜、且以經濟關係、故未能加以充分研究、此事卽暫告擱置、</p>
<h3 id="c130">一二八後 <a href="#c130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>迨去歲一二八滬戰發生、吾校遭日軍横摧、痛憤之餘、乃此理想中之秘密無線電話、怱又呈現、遂積極研究、直至十月間、覺此機構造極簡單、是時卽就理想所得、與同學李繼三君商談、李君當認爲有試騐價值、於是乃懇學校當局、予以經濟上之輔助、結果蒙校長翁子龍·秘書長周尚應許、得從事試騐、</p>
<h3 id="c131">試騐成功 <a href="#c131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>嗣經中央研究院物理研究、加以討論、並經蔡金濤先生親自來校復加試騐、認爲理論與事實相符、僅小部分尚待加以改善、按此一小部分、改善殊易、日内當能次第修改、使臻完美、</p>

<p>王君續謂、現時普通播音機所發出消息、有收音機者均可任意收取、余所發明之秘密無綫電話、收發方面皆爲特殊裝置、非普通收音機所能收取、其構造甚爲簡單、頗合軍事一切發號施令之用、蓋現時所發軍事電報、雖用密碼、但往往甚易推測、倘一旦密碼簿遺失、則危險更甚、至詳細原理與構造及使用方法、因關軍事秘密、恕不發表也云云、</p>

<p>（六）本埠胡念祖君來信丨我是由農村來</p>
<p>我在貴欄看了到農村去的討論，引起了我的回憶，因爲我剛剛是個從農村來的鄉下佬。我的家庭。雖不是地主，但也總算是個收租榖吃的。我家有個管港莊，水路又好，田土又肥，隔大鄉村又遠，不通大道，位置又在江西一個極不開通的上高縣，而且這莊上又不是在窮谷深山，從來没有到過兵匪，更不會有藏匪的危險，是一個多麽安靜的地方呵，我本來早有到這裏建築一個理想鄉村的計畫，可是開步走就遇着難關。像從來没有晒過太陽的我，拿甚麽武藝來對付這幾十畝田呢？請個僱農吧？要曉得在鄉村假使是想請個先生，只要口說一句，就這裏薦一個，那裏薦一個，若是要一個長工麽，確是有點麻煩，不消說慣例是要頂付半年或一年的工資，好的他給你一個不虧本，不好的他或者同一時間定三四個地主的工，或者做了半年甚至於還没有上工，他便逃之夭夭了。老實說，在鄉下想做個不勞而食者，事實上已將近靠不不呵！鄉村的種種怪現像，是很值得我們注意的。一方面人口急速减少，一方面荒地一天天地增加。同時另一方面，却又有大批的流氓産生。這種矛盾現像，很顯然的不僅是在乎耕者没其田，而是在乎有田不能耕。一方面雖然是苛捐雜稅的有加無已，但最大的根本原因，則由於外國資本主義的勢力侵入農村，提高了農村生活的程度，同時農産物的價格，相對的减少，尤以最近一兩年爲顯著。所以弄得農村經濟破産，許多農民，流爲兵匪，自然這些流落的農民，不但是由生産者變成不生産者，而且是由生育者變成了不生育者，因此影響到抛女孩子的慘劇，愈演愈烈。長此以往，中國四萬萬同胞，恐怕不必要日本人勞神吧！編輯先生像一個老練的自耕農，在鄉村也有破産的危機與可能，難道城市過慣了生活的人，能夠在鄉村謀生嗎？尤懷臯先生，求你指敎，我城市的人，逼得没路，要想到鄉下去；農村的人，逼得没路，又要想到城市去；到底那裏是康莊的大道呢？又農産品價格相對的减少，農村生活程度飛躍的提高，和苛捐雜稅的有加無已，······這些原因所引起的農村經濟破産和農村的騷擾，是不是可以農村敎育來挽回呢？　　（七）本埠朱嬰君來信丨在現狀下要回農村去事實上是辦不到的</p>
<p>記者先生介紹尤懷臯先生說：﹁尤先生主張鄉村敎育救國論。對於鄉村敎育很有研究，而且是一位實行家。﹂的確我讀了他答雄聲君的信，他的精密而切實的辦法，逈非空談理論者所能道出隻字，不過尤先生說：﹁憑我能力所及，用十年的工夫。來建設一個意想中的新式桃源。﹂這種新式桃源，誰不夢想，誰不欲立刻把牠實現；無奈目前的中國，整個農村經濟破産，人民求生之不遑，那裏有餘力以任人之長久經營？并且因此而引起的兩個力量對抗，有些地方已經很顯著了，有些地方雖不甚顯著，然也在伏流中濳進，這些情形都是到鄉村去很難應付的問題。比如照尤先生的辦法，果回到農村辦這麽一所學校，然在兩個力量對抗之下，究竟佔到那一面，佔在有勢力者一面，似乎不是辦學校的本旨，佔在没勢力者一面，一定給有勢力者壓迫；至於說兩面都不發生關係，那又與尤先生所謂﹁在村中廣播好感﹂的話相衝突；而且事實上也絶對不可能。雖然江浙一帶的農村，在目前說起來，有些地方比較好些；然帝國主義者的侵略，國内惡勢力的逐層剥削，二三年以後，還不是走上同一命運！所以在中國任何地方，想在十年内建設一個新式桃源，事實上恐是辦不到的。因此，雄聲君果回到農村去，恐不但不能達他遠大的目的，便連他的那種﹁犯法没有膽，自殺没勇氣﹂的因子（生活問題）將仍没法除去。尤先生是一個研究敎育的人，或者對此道别有遠見，我們不能知道，尚希賜敎！</p>

<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>桃花是純粹的民間文學家，它專愛替三瓦兩舍的人家點綴風景；凡是，貴族式文學家牡丹，官僚式文學家芍藥所不屑一顧的地方，它一定很歡喜去揮灑與描寫，路上行人望見了它的文章色彩，便會歡欣鼓舞地忘却了本身的勞碌；一切時人文士，又特地載酒而來，欣賞它的民間文學；這可見得它的大作確有雅俗共賞的價值了。何况，到了夏秋之間，它的文章的結論，又都甜津津的使人家不忍去口呢？</p>
<p>有人說：﹁桃花，是一稿四投的文學家；它攏總只做得這一篇文章，但，發表的所在，先後却有四處，或在樹頭，或在空中，或在地上，或在水面；地點雖然不同，材料却是一般，這不是一稿四投麽？﹂我說：不然。材料雖是一般，文章却有四篇。它在樹頭所寫的一篇，何等的花團錦簇，如火如茶？寫在空中的一篇，﹁將飛更作迥風舞、已落猶呈半面妝﹂，何等的天仙化人？寫在地上的一篇，和那翡翠地衣，參差映襯，何等的左縈右拂，隨處都成了妙諦？寫在水面的一篇，﹁流水落花春去也，天上人間﹂，何等的動人心絃，繫人夢想？古人欣賞它的文章，只欣賞它寫在水面的一篇，稱爲﹁落花水面皆文章﹂。其實，它的四篇文章是篇篇好的，而寫在水面的一篇，尤其是它﹁臨去秋波那一轉﹂的傑作。</p>

<p>— 雍</p>
<p>梁士詒逝世，巳見前報。兹聞日來中外知交前往弔唁者，絡繹不絶，緣梁氏生前交游極廣也。其家因梁氏生前以寄居異國，心常鬱鬱，故擬在滬開弔後，逕運柩歸粤，不再至港。又治喪之禮，一遵其太翁遺敎，不用鼓樂，不用僧道，不擇日時，一切用極簡單辦法，以矯習俗云。</p>
<p>梁氏將北上前，詠詩一首云：雪鬢摩挲午夢殘，江梅岸柳一般看，五千里外雙孫妮，四十年前舊史官，不炫文章驚海内，祇餘顱血灑江干，歡呼羣季磨長劍，遠睇新亭欲據鞍。其時邊氛巳惡，梁氏欲至平有所計畫，故其語云然，所云顱血灑江干，閱者多以爲異，今竟殁於黄浦江干，亦詩讖也。梁氏平生作詩甚少，此其絶筆云。</p>

<p>我們的團體，現在已改稱﹁遼吉黑民衆後援××隊﹂，我雖在訓練期内，但是工作也非常緊張：四小時嚴格的訓練，二小的步哨，以及三十里的跑步，是每天固定的生活；一日兩頓的高梁白菜，造成我强固的肌肉，堅决的意志！軍中的號聲，不時散佈出悲壯的音調來！我興奮，我覺得只有軍中的生活，才使我興奮！</p>
<p>﹁日前宋軍喜峯口一役，得從未有之大捷；斃敵萬餘，光復陣地有百里之遙······﹂這消息傳到我們隊裏時，全體歡呼雷動；興奮緊張的空氣，彌漫了整個</p>

<p>的操場！我們的赤血在奔騰着，我們的肌肉在跳動着！隊長豎起大拇指大聲地說：﹁弟兄們，我們一定也有這樣的一天！······﹂當然，我們是無時無刻不在渴望着手刃倭子，血濺沙塲！我們要用鮮血來湔雪奇恥！我們要用頭顱來換取　　豈知走到報館會計處，一尺高，半尺寛的窗洞口，雖不是人山人海，却擠着六七位投稿同志。高的，矮的，胖的，瘦的，洋裝革履的，長袍短褂的，式式都有，一應俱全。還有一位金神父路曹××先生的令媛，（或許是，）也擠在人叢裏，替曹先生領稿費。我是略略懂得一些洋大人帶來的文明，所以立即挨在曹女士背後。接着又來了一位，二位，三位，前者未去，後者又來，大家手裏揑着支酬單。小小的一張，一張，活像賬濟饑民的施粥票。</p>
<p>大家拉長了　子，期待着洞口，第一位要小便，第二位等得不耐煩，停一會再來，第三位······以便站在後面的早些挨到前面去。但這是胡思亂想，同希望日本大地震，自動放棄東北，一樣的是瞎子望天坍。正在這緊張得大家熱汗從額上一直滾到袴腰的空氣裏，履聲槖槖，又有一位大學生式同志，加入這個人團裏。突然的，這位同志發見了站在洞外第二位的是老朋友，走前去握了一握手，肩頭一擠，後來居上，列在第三位。幸而這些同志，都是斯文一脈，大家退後一位，耐着性兒等着。</p>

<p>— 憶秋自錫寄</p>
<p>這裏充滿着平民的生機，一般流浪營生的艒艒船，不斷地向這裏集中；他們的生活，是多麽地隨便而神聖！而一個人，都必須用正己的力來養活自己，除開還不能走路的小孩以外；啊！時代的驕子！</p>
<p>近來，我們門口的河邊，來了一艘極破舊的艒艒船，這船上的男主人，是社會上認爲最下賤的黄包車夫；女主人，也是大人先生目光所看不見的敲石了的女工；他倆有一個十三四歲的兒子，每天早晨，一定提一籃大餅油條到各處去兜售，一個十一二歲的女兒，每天到工廠附近去拾煤屑，還有一個八九歲的女兒，在船上粘折各種紅綠紙的玩具，預備給伊的哥哥去兜銷，伊的兼職是帶領着一個三歲的弟弟和看家丨艒艒船丨眞的，像他們這樣，可算是一個力的家庭，最摩登的家庭。</p>
<p>昨天，我偶然和内子織雲到門口去散步，見他們正在狹小的船梢上，全家圍聚着享受他們血汗所換來的代價品丨靑菜丨田螺丨飯丨</p>
<p>﹁這種人眞苦啊！﹂織雲在他們的飯碗裏注意了一下，嘆息地告訴我。﹁我看比他們再快活的人恐怕很少了！﹂我這樣回答伊。﹁你又在發神經了！﹂伊似乎在責備我了。</p>
<p>沉黩了一會：</p>
<p>﹁哎嗄！你看他們的被窩多麽髒啊！﹂伊又忘了我的神經病悄聲對我說。﹁髒？我看比那些大公館的姨太太總要乾凈一點！﹂我微笑着。伊說我是神經病，討厭我，伊進去了，我就和他們中間的男主人黄包車夫又閒談起來了：﹁阿貴！你黄包車拉了幾年了？﹂</p>
<p>﹁才拉了一年多！﹂</p>
<p>﹁從前做什麽生活？﹂</p>
<p>﹁推小車！做碼頭小工！﹂</p>
<p>﹁爲什麽從前不拉黄包車？﹂</p>
<p>﹁我們的生活没有一定，聽說那裏出息好，就搬到那裏去；旣用不着搬塲汽車，也用不着脚夫塌車，因爲我們的家丨艒艒船丨搬來搬去是十分便當的；而且我們有的是氣力，什麽事都能做，所以不必認定那一行去做，譬如在上海，因爲電車公共汽車多，拉黄包車就算不來，我就做碼頭小工，今年到了這裏拉黄包車生意倒還不差！﹂</p>
<p>﹁那末你現在一天可以拉多少錢呢？﹂</p>
<p>﹁除掉車租每天一兩吊錢是　得住的！﹂</p>
<p>﹁你老婆敲石子每天可以掙多少錢？﹂</p>
<p>﹁伊不行，一天最多五六百文！﹂</p>
<p>﹁你的兒子賣大餅可以賺多少一天呢？﹂</p>
<p>﹁吊把錢！﹂</p>
<p>﹁你的女兒拾煤屑可賣多少錢呢？﹂</p>
<p>﹁煤屑自己燒飯吃，不賣錢！﹂</p>
<p>﹁你的小女兒做紙人一天可掙多少？﹂</p>
<p>﹁最多一二百文！﹂</p>
<p>﹁你們一家每天要吃多少米？﹂</p>
<p>﹁總要五六升！﹂</p>
<p>﹁零有呢？﹂</p>
<p>﹁我們是窮人，没有什麽零用，連茶葉都不吃，就是省不了的肥皂和剃頭，平均一個月有一兩塊錢也儘够了！﹂</p>
<p>﹁那末，你們的進賬很够開銷了！每天有得餘一點嗎？﹂</p>
<p>﹁照現在說每天可以餘一吊多錢！﹂</p>
<p>﹁餘下的錢怎樣用呢？﹂</p>
<p>﹁預備添添衣服，或者生意不好的時候貼補貼補！﹂</p>
<p>夜幕張開，大地漸漸昏黑下去，我們的談話也終止了；我高興，因爲我發現了人們所絶不注意的生活之一角；而且，是一個人們所意想不到的快樂的家庭。</p>

<h3 id="c212">中國人的生偮圈 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 何家幹</p>
<p>﹁螻蟻尚知貪生﹂，中國百姓向來自稱﹁蟻民﹂，我爲暫時保全自己的生命計，時常留心着比較安全的處所，除英雄豪傑之外，想必不至於譏笑我的罷。</p>
<p>不過，我於正面的記載，是不大相信的，往往用一種另外的看法。例如罷，報上說，北平正在設備防空，我見了並不覺得可靠；但看見載着古物的南運，却立刻感到古城的危機，並且由這古物的行踪，推測中國樂土的所在。</p>
<p>現在，一批一批的古物，都集中到上海來了，可見最安全的地方，到底還是上海的租界上。</p>
<p>然而，房租是一定要貴起來的了。</p>
<p>這在﹁蟻民﹂也是一個大打擊，所以還得想想另外的地方。</p>
<p>想來想去，想到了一個﹁生命圈﹂。這就是說，旣非﹁腹地﹂，也非﹁邊疆﹂，是介乎兩者之間，正如一個環子，一個圈子的所在，在這里倒或者也可以﹁苟延性命於×世﹂的。</p>
<p>﹁邊疆﹂上是飛機抛炸彈。據日本報，說是在勦滅﹁兵匪﹂；據中國報，說是屠戮了人民，村落市廛，一片瓦礫。﹁腹地﹂裏也是飛機抛炸彈。據上海報，說是在勦滅﹁共匪﹂，他們被炸得一塌胡塗；﹁共匪﹂的報上怎麽說呢，我們可不知道。但總而言之，邊疆上是炸，炸，炸：腹地裏也是炸，炸，炸。雖然一面是别人炸，一面是自己炸，炸手不同，而被炸則一。只有在這兩者之間的，只要炸彈不要誤行落下來，倒還有可免﹁血肉横飛﹂的希望，所以我名之曰﹁中國人的生命圈﹂。</p>
<p>再從外面炸進來，這﹁生命圈﹂便收縮而爲﹁生命線﹂；再炸進來，大家便都逃進炸好了的﹁腹地﹂裏面去，這﹁生命圈﹂便完結而爲﹁生命○﹂。</p>
<p>其實，這預感是大家都有的，只要看這一年來，文章上不大見有﹁我中國地大物博，人口衆多﹂的套話了，便是一個證據。而有一位先生，還在演說上自己說中國人是﹁弱小民族﹂哩。</p>
<p>但這一番話，闊人們是不以爲然的，因爲他們不但有飛機，還有他們的﹁外國﹂！</p>
<h3 id="c213">國文講話 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 林語堂</p>
<p>國文是中國人的文章之省，自中國人言之，不必說中國二字，大家巳可了解。這樣講，國文二字所以與他國蟹行文字别，與國醫，國駡，國食義重在國字同。所以怎樣才像中國人的文章，便就是國文，反是便不是國文。比如馮玉祥從前通電，駡吳稚暉爲﹁蒼髯老賊，皓首匹夫，﹂我們便覺得這不是國文，因爲太不像中國人的說話，不合中國通電體裁。張學良下野通電，謂﹁有生之日即報國之年，﹂我們讀來，很像中國人的話，便是得體國文。</p>
<p>嘗謂中文之所謂﹁通﹂，便是西文之所謂ldiomatic，通非通，乃合語言習慣問題，而非文法問題。凡合中國語法，或語言習慣者皆謂之通。例如春秋﹁夏，享公，﹂雖無主詞，然旣合語言習慣，便可謂之通。又如魏國公太師秦懀割地通和時，作一篇赦河南州軍文，未述大金功德，兀突認爲國文不通，檜乃令程克俊爲文曰：﹁上穹悔禍，副生靈願治之心，大國行仁，遂子道事親之孝，可謂非常之盛事，敢忘莫報之深恩······。﹂於是兀突認爲這是很通的國文，因爲曰仁曰孝，曰盛事，曰深恩，都很合中國語言習慣。</p>
<p>一國文字，爲一國文化精英所寄托，所以各能表現其不同的民族精神。在中國，因爲特别關係，讀書成爲特種階級的專利，所以文章益趨巧妙，而所謂文章之含義，尤爲特别。大槪有黼黻文章之意·有條理，有文彩的，才稱爲文。故文章二字，惟中國有之，西文ＢeilesＬettres去文章之義尚遠。比如﹁不抵抗﹂便是白話，﹁長期抵抗﹂，便有文彩，是文章；﹁不攘外﹂，便是白話，﹁先安内﹂便有文彩，是文章。這種國文，都是蟹行文字所無。至於武人忽然想起打仗，亦必﹁師出有名，﹂或弔民，或伐罪，當其出師表做好時，如能文從字順，辭達義安，文人便大家爭相傳誦道好。所不懂及受愚者，惟一些不知文章義法的平民而巳。</p>
<p>兹舉國文作法須知三點：</p>
<p>（一）曲達　孟子言辭達而已，自爲文章正宗，千古不易。然此僅可爲賢聖上智言之。因爲達固妙，然吾輩旣非賢聖，所欲達之言，也許平平而已，故僅達不能爲文，必須加以文彩。於是荀子進一步，主張﹁曲得所謂﹂。非相篇說﹁君子之於言無厭，鄙夫反是，好其實不恤其文，是以終身不免埤汚傭俗，﹂如墨子之徒，所作之文，便是好其實不恤其文，不恤其文，所以是是非非明，是是非非明，便無曲得所謂之妙，所以終身爲鄙夫。鄙夫是不能作﹁深文周納﹂的文章的。</p>
<p>（二）吞吐　野蠻人打仗，擒一個，吃一個，向無所謂欲擒故縱，於是永遠享不到七擒孟獲的榮耀。在打仗之擒縱術，便是在文章上之吞吐術。上引馮玉祥含血噴人鋒芒太露的話，論者以爲欠涵養，馮氏至此吃其虧，乃不知吞吐所致。盡言招過，古有明訓，故善行文者必不盡言，留個半截，爲將來見面餘地。故行文須多用﹁然而，﹂﹁則亦，﹂﹁假如，﹂﹁亦可﹂等字樣。詩曰左之左之，君子宜之，右之右之，君子有之，如此左宜右有，將來享用無窮，是爲君子。</p>
<p>（三）輕鬆　行文忌急，忌露，忌衝口而出，上端巳經言之。然欲勿急勿露，必先治心養性，讀萬卷書，胸懷豁達，是謂之涵養。言者心聲而已，所以要做中國人文章，必先有中國人心地。故行文首須養生，飼鵝種菊，觀雲賞月，心地輕鬆，然後自我觀之，世事如浮雲，收回東北固好，奉送四省亦無妨。至此境地，然後輕舒皓腕，聊搦管城，於拇指與中指之問；不疾不遲，不重不輕，靠毛筆與白紙之接觸，靜悄悄的一字一字寫出，如隔岸觀火，評論是非，辯而不爭，察而不激，不左不右，母適，母必，似戰似和，亦晴亦雨，左派讀之雖悲</p>
<p>壯　右派讀之亦温和，再引一兩句王陽明﹁治心﹂做點綴，也就十分古雅。</p>
<p>三法：曲達又可稱烘雲托月法，吞吐又可稱龍翻鳳舞法，輕鬆又可稱隔岸觀火法。三法工夫煉到，便成中國文人。</p>

<p>— 江天蔚</p>
<p>這是我的童年裏的一件最難忘記的事，我的心上永遠刻劃着這一幕慘劇，我越想忘記牠，牠便越淸楚的湧現出來。</p>
<p>那時我有九歲，我的弟弟才六歲，我的哥哥比我大三年。這一年裏閙着荒旱，家裏常常一粒米也没有，自然也没有錢。父親已經出門去了。母親和祖母時常喞喞噥噥地私語着，還流着眼涙，表情是那樣的痛苦。</p>
<p>一天，我聽得母親對祖母說：</p>
<p>﹁三個孩子决不能讓他們那樣吃，媽也不能那樣吃，只有我······﹂</p>
<p>我不明白，爲什麽母親是那樣說，﹁我不能吃，﹂什麽東西她不能吃呢？我懷疑着。</p>
<p>﹁讓我受苦吧！等到他們的爸爸回來了，總可以有點錢給我們，就是一角錢也好。現在只有讓我這樣做下去······﹂母親說到這裏，眼涙流得更多。祖母也流涙了。</p>
<p>我是一個富於感受性的憂鬱的孩子，我見母親和祖母那樣傷心，非常難受，　我不知媽們爲的什麽，我又不敢問。：吃夜飯的時候，母親給我們端來四碗粥。我的哥哥和弟弟都不顧一切的把一碗粥很快的吞下去了。我故意裝着嫌粥熱，慢慢的吃，祖母也和我一樣。我想起日間母親說的話，我似乎有三分領悟了。我不覺凄聲的呌着：</p>
<p>﹁母親！母親！你來吃呀！﹂</p>
<p>﹁我已經吃過了呢！﹂母親在廚房回答，她的喉嚨裏像還塞着什麽東西一樣。﹁奎兒！你好好吃吧！﹂祖母温柔地的對我說。</p>
<p>我實在忍不住了，爲什麽母親不來和我們一道吃呢？我放下碗，奔到廚房去，我要母親來和我們一道吃。當我跑進廚房的時候，母親正在苦嚥着什麽東西，她看見我去了，立刻掩藏起來。</p>
<p>﹁媽就來和你們一道吃，我還有點事没有做好，我就來！﹂</p>
<p>母親帶着痛苦的臉色，跟着我，坐到飯桌上來了。</p>
<p>祖母依舊没有把那碗稀飯吞下去，她看見了母親，又壓不住一陣悲酸，滴下幾滴老涙，可是，母親却靜靜的一語不發。</p>
<p>我看到母親的嘴上，留着有許多糠渣似的東西，我的童心裏像突然受着了沉重的打擊，我立刻哭起來。母親和祖母全不曉和我爲的什麽。</p>
<p>以後，我無時無刻不跟住母親，除開我上山砍柴的時光以外。</p>

<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>大家一齊響應了。這是何等悲壯的一瞬間！接着又連呼了幾個動人的口號，便向北前進。海泉看見那頭來了一輛電車，他便躱在電車的後面，撒了好些傳單在白渡橋上，口裏也呼着發音不正確的口號。到後來他只是應着他們的呼聲，﹁啊啊﹂地空呌了。他擔心在前後面有巡捕會走來捉他。他翻轉頭向南首望時，看見李一香率着幾位文壇先進也遠遠地跟着來。</p>
<p>他們終於走過了白渡橋，丨丨平時，可以看見有兩名斯格蘭兵拿着長槍守衛在那兒的，今天幸得没有看見他們，丨丨折進北蘇州路，沿北蘇州路向西進，一面呼口號，一面撒傳單。　　﹁啊呀！不得了！﹂</p>
<p>將行近乍浦路橋口來了。海泉看見前前後後來了一大批的黑色獵狗，海泉着慌了，把手中的傳單全數向蘇州河裏一撒。他留心那些獵狗的舉動。中國的走前來搶他們的傳單和旗幟。有兩個白色的走過來捉在前頭領導的幾個靑年。日本的最不講理，拿起木棍來就向這般靑年的腿上亂打。海泉繞了一個圈子，躱到一家白俄的古玩店門首來了。他看見一個矮小的日本巡捕最賣氣力，還在揮着他手裏的木棒亂打一個靑年。海泉看見，有無限的痛心。怱然聽見嘩喇的一響，那個日本巡捕仆倒在馬路上了。原來那個日本獵狗的毒打中國靑年竟激怒了一位剛剛在那邊走過的中國工人，他便拿起手中的酒瓶向着那個日本巡捕的側面上痛擊了一下。就在這瞬間，另一個日本巡捕却向那個義俠的工友開了一槍。那個工友就這樣地遂了他的光榮的最後！</p>
<p>這次的示威遊行，海泉覺得損失太大了。除了他和另兩個男性的同志幸免於難外，可以說是全軍覆没。他覺得這個犧牲實在太無意義了。</p>
<p>當他走到西華德路口來時，還遇着一個日本巡捕走來檢查他的身體，他用不甚巧妙的上海話來盤詰他。</p>
<p>﹁我是見物！﹂</p>
<p>這是他從鶴子夫人學來的一句日本話。他把牠利用了。那個日本巡捕便笑了一笑，放他走過身了。</p>
<p>坐在電車裏的時候，他的胸口還是砰砰地跳躍得非常的厲害。他一面私自慶幸，有剛才那樣的機智，才得爲漏網之魚。不然，此刻眞是受罪了。但一面又暗暗地咀咒自己的卑鄙和怯懦了。他感着了一種矛盾的痛苦了。</p>

<p>— 小之</p>
<p>日前某報載一段關於破獲自稱皇帝的濟南通信，讀之頗覺滑稽。大意：一個無業遊民的王某，平素自命不凡，頗有﹁皇帝﹂思想。二月間在院内拾得所謂﹁龍衣﹂一襲，以爲天賜，當順天命，南面稱尊，遂以狂言惑衆，召集信徒竟至數百人之多，並派所謂﹁軍師﹂二人，採辦各種儀器，以備擇吉登極。事爲范縣長及駐軍某旅長偵悉，於是，此一還没有坐上龍椅的﹁准皇帝﹂，居然先嘗嘗鐵窗風味矣。</p>
<p>這事，與去年十二月間，也在濟南閙過的一件自號﹁三皇﹂的妖匪案略同。惟﹁三皇﹂案之匪首僞﹁天皇﹂李樂川，因有﹁娘娘﹂會拍馬屁，所以現在已經得了自由：王某現在還在軍法處受審，將來怎樣處决，尚不得而知，但據我推想，王某如果會抄前﹁李娘娘﹂的故智，甜蜜蜜的說﹁范大老爺准我狀﹂﹁保你坐皇位﹂﹁請將我大御八塊﹂，自然也是﹁哈哈大笑﹂，最多只收没﹁龍衣，儀器﹂而念其﹁神經深受剌激﹂﹁殊堪憐憫﹂，還我﹁准皇帝﹂王先生以自由也　　這類滑稽的事，雖說出於愚昧無知，而的確﹁殊堪憐憫﹂，但蛛絲馬跡，頗有許多線索呌人懷疑着背後是敵人在有計劃的搗鬼！看，前次李樂川的口供，有﹁宣統曾派人來接洽，并允日本可供給槍砲﹂，以及這次的﹁龍衣﹂是打那兒來的？果是﹁天﹂降賜的嗎？即屬﹁鄰人惡作劇﹂，試問鄰人何來此﹁龍衣﹂？在我的想像中，此襲﹁龍衣﹂必定是珠光寳氣，至少也當是﹁紅緞子﹂﹁金線湘繡﹂像戲台上假皇帝們穿着的大搖大擺的衣服，試問﹁鄰人﹂誰肯花這大的本錢去﹁惡作劇﹂？旣然是﹁鄰人的惡作劇﹂，何處又來此數百信徒？·········像這樣層層的追究，我們認其爲單純的﹁神經深受剌激﹂而予以﹁殊堪憐憫﹂呢？還會隠約看見傀儡背後拉線的一隻巨掌靈？</p>

<p>— 蔚</p>
<p>讀四月六日本刊見有歐陽君之﹁兩化元之七一五捷法﹂一表，算法精巧，至堪欽佩！惟鄙意此種類似珠处飛歸之口訣，非熟讀殊難記憶，且計算時因所牽涉之位數過多，不便應用，猶覺美中不足耳。兹就研究所及，得另一捷法，簡述如下，以供讀者之研究。</p>
<p>捷法將所欲折合銀元之銀兩數，乘以一·四，得一乘積（銀元數）：更由此乘積减去千分之一之數（即該乘積小數點移前三位之數），即得欲求之銀元數。例如欲以規銀三百六十七兩，依法定洋釐七一五，折合銀元，其式如下：</p>
<p>３６７×１·４＝５１３·８８元</p>
<p>５１３　８０元—０·５１３８元＝５１３·２８６２元</p>
<p>按用此捷法所得結果，與用常法以洋釐除銀兩數所得之結果，兩相比較，如折成之銀元數在百數時，相差不過幾毫；在萬數時，相差不過幾分，屢試不爽。惟須注意者，在應用此法時，洋釐須爲七一五之法定率，否則乘數應隨同變史。至此法所涉及之算理，以本刊篇幅有限，不贅。</p>

<p>從排字房歸來</p>
<p>有人寫了許多上海夜話，上海之夜是地獄上面的天堂；我想上海晨話未始不可寫，因爲上海之晨是天堂中的地獄；在享樂者結束他們的夜生活的時候，勞動階級丨至少是生産者，開始他們的努力。現在從我們的事業先談起吧，上海正有不少的人吃着這碗飯。</p>
<p>經理先生在編輯室的玻璃櫃中貼上一張本報自明日起改排式樣的通告，於是我們編輯室中的濟濟羣雄都御駕親征往排字房去。平時本埠新聞，金融欄，附刊，均預先發稿由排字房工友排版。今天得了本經理的電話，校對完了之後，都没有上架子；我們編完了電報到排字房已是一點過後，各人打着呼欠排版，也别問比從前的格式好看，工作完畢，已是第二天剛發亮的時候。</p>
<p>﹁牠媽的，銷路不是很好嗎！改什麽牢什子的樣！﹂小陳把寛大的近視眼鏡正了正鼻樑，自言自語的踏出排字房。　　綽號小白臉的老何，面上的雪花和汗珠已凝在一處，不住用手帕揩拭。</p>
<p>﹁小陳，明天（今天）卡爾登的約約不是又要起個早嗎？加薪水總是牽絲扳藤，好好的報，還是這樣那樣的起花頭，自已伴着小老婆睡覺，呌人家熬夜！﹂老何接着嚕囌的說。</p>
<p>四面一望，不見一輛人力車，不知是否交班的時候。我們不得不拖着沉重的脚步移動。</p>
<p>﹁老何，又有艶遇嗎？﹂</p>
<p>老何没有回答。天色剛發白，路燈也失了牠的光芒，三條修長的影子横在路上輕輕地向前，正像鬼氣沉沉的地獄一般。</p>
<p>拖過兩條馬路，發現了新大陸，原來是幾輛人力車挾着車槓迎面過來，三個人不約而同的跳上車去，按着帽緣點</p>

<p>坐上車，眼皮羞澀得更沉重，於是朦朧的合上眼，身上在柏油路上淌過，覺到分外的舒適。</p>
<p>我像做夢似的驀聽見後面有迫切的脚步聲趕來，我想嚴冬穏穏的過去，在春天碰見殺猪　豈不貽笑大方。心是怦怦動，睡意完全驅除，全神灌注的聽那聲音從後面近來，我用力在脚踏板上一按，車夫受了不均衝的一下，返過頭來問：﹁不是薩坡賽路？﹂他以爲拉錯了路，我不能告訴他這一按的理由，怒氣的說：﹁快些拉﹂，但是一問答之間，後來的一輛車已追近我的車旁，那車夫的開花鞋打在柏油路上，像馬蹄一樣的拍拍作聲。我因爲暗笑自己的誤會側過頭去，那車上的乘客正微笑的望着我：一位上海夜話中的主角丨ＤancingＧjrl。　　我的車夫被人家追上，嚕咕的說：﹁小三子，來！﹂他們像賽跑似的拉着車子跑，那舞女在車上顫動的笑。</p>
<p>﹁在那裏跳舞塲？﹂我問。</p>
<p>﹁大東。﹂</p>
<p>她的車子慢慢追向前，那車夫得意的喊出：﹁小六子，來！﹂</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我現在有一件很難解决的事情，先生倘能在貴報店員通訊欄上，給我一個圓滿的答覆，我眞是感激不　了。事實是這樣的：鄙年現年二十八歲，在洋行裏做一個職員。去年秋季方與一位姓黄的女士結婚。在我們没有結婚的時候，由她的介紹，得識了她的最親近的小姊妹楊女士。以後我們也曾在黄女士的家中，見面過幾次，但總不過點點首而已。自從我們結婚之後，這位楊女士就時常來拜望我的妻子，因此我就同她比較從前更加熟識了。時光如流水一般的逝去，到了現在她竟與我表示很親愛的樣子，且時常約我出去游公園同看電影等事情；我因爲情面難却，所以曾和她去看過一次電影。可是我的妻子，並没有知道這種事情；倘一旦給我的妻子知道了，不是要發生醋意嗎？，然若如與楊女士决絶了，我又覺得對她不起。現在我眞是左右爲難，懇</p>
<p>先生給我一個圓滿的解决。祝你</p>
<p>精神快愉　　　陳影秋上</p>
<p>編者按：陳君是一個已結婚的男子，倘使再與他的妻之友丨楊女士丨談愛情，雖說因爲對方當然已經知道你是一個有婦之夫，你並没有欺騙的行爲，似乎在法律上，在道德上，都没有十分說不過去的地方；但是她旣經十分有情於你，你就應當代她設想，免得她日後悔且無及。所以你要設法避免這一重糾葛</p>
<p>刷盡奇恥　雄滿洲國</p>
<p>，實在是對的；不過要是你直捷爽快地拒絶她，未免使她所受的創痕太深，也覺不十分妥當。據我們推想所得，陳君一定是一個知情識趣的男子丨瞞了自己的妻子，一個人同她去看電影丨所以才能博得楊女士一往情深的熱情。明瞭了這點，陳君的難題就迎刃而角了。你不妨裝一個不識趣的蠢漢，當她來約你的時候，就要求她約你的妻子同去。這樣一方面可以表示你興你的夫人，愛情頗篤，使她覺得無機可乘，另一方面，有了這樣一個保鑣夫人，什麽就不怕了。她看見你這樣的舉動，自然會把一顆心，漸漸地冷下來的。末了我們以爲，陳君的友朋中，倘使另有尚在求偶的有爲靑年，陳君倒不妨替他們介紹介紹。總之她要秘密，你偏要公開，這是我們所相得到的對付這問題的妙法。</p>

<p>— 非我</p>
<p>四馬路上三十文看一齣</p>
<p>中國近年來，電影事業，一天發達一天。社會上人士對於電影的趣味，也一天一天比一天濃厚。吾人追溯己往的歷史，外國電影輸入中國，大槪分作三個時期：第一個時期，是香港，第二期是上海，第三時期，才到平津漢口······和内地各埠。輸到上海的第一次大約是在三十年前，上海地方忽然來了一個外國人帶着淺藍色的眼鏡，提了一架半舊的電影機器，另外雇了幾個紅頭阿三拿着銅鼓和洋喇叭，每天在四馬路昇平茶樓大吹大擂地閙着。那時候上海還不甚繁盛，西人到滬經商的還居少數。上海人驀地裏看見這位外國人很是奇怪。但是他老先生桌子上的那一端，佈着一塊白竹布，把機器一扭，（用的還是乾電）就好像變戲法似地，忽而山川，忽而人物，黑影幢幢的都在白布上接繼的來住着。聚觀的人們，一個個都看得口定目呆，以爲這是新到的﹁西洋鏡﹂，但，胡蘆裏賣的是什麽藥，却始終猜不出。這就是電影輸入中國最初的導火線。</p>
<p>於是慢慢地就知道了這位外國人的名字了，他是西班牙的人，名呌疎麻斯。同時也是在上海創辦電影院的第一人。他最初到滬的時候，大約是在一九零三年之譜。當時，向他看﹁西洋鏡﹂電影的，每人需出錢三十文，只許看一次，再看再出錢。到現在出過三十文電他影戲的人，提起這件事，還對人﹁津津的樂道哩。﹂後來因爲生意發達，就在乍浦路獨辦了一所電影院，即現在的虹口大戲院。這就是電影院出現在上海的第一家。</p>
<p>近年來上海電影事業發達得像電般的，影戲院開映的廣告，幾乎觸目街頭。談起坐價來，最初是賣三十文，現在看一次電影，最起碼是二角，最高得要三四元不等。比較起來，眞是天遠地隔了！不知道這些電影觀衆們作何感想呢？</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c244">評﹁女性的只喊﹂ <a href="#c244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>的確，在黑暗勢力瀰漫了整個中國的目前，﹁婦女解放﹂的聲浪，應該是高徹雲霄而激起一個偉大的怒潮。她們的苦痛，她們的掙扎，無疑義的，她們必須用自己的力量，打開一條光明的出路。</p>
<p>那末，﹁女性的呐喊﹂便是在這種高潮中所激盪而成的作品。假如牠眞能代表這種解放運動，甚至於負起指導者的任務，那末一定是中國觀衆們所十分需要的了。</p>
<p>但是，編劇兼導演的沈西苓先生在這片中告訴了我們一些什麽呢？有産階級的葉蓮受了﹁内戰﹂的犧牲，回到鄉村又受了土匪的搶刦，而不得不携着弱妹而逃到都市。在都市，在工廠中，她又受着﹁雙重壓迫﹂而痛苦哀號，也從事無力的奮鬥，結果，醒了戀愛的迷夢，並且知道了﹁個人奮鬥﹂之不夠，於是在字幕上告訴我們，她應該是覺醒了。</p>
<p>不錯，在理論上，這都是相當正確的，而且也算分析了現實社會的錯綜的關係和形態，但是照劇情的演進，這個女主人翁葉蓮，應該在前部是一個相當覺悟的靑年，而有堅强的意志，到後來，她應當是一個堅决的反抗者，而且應當謀取正當的解放步驟。同時她旣受了先知先覺的少英之啓示，以她的理解力，决不會那般幼稚而再三的接受着包飯作老板之欺騙和愚弄。這裏不免是劇本本身欠完善的塲合。如上所述，葉蓮在沈先生的理想中，却相反的成爲一個十分怯懦的女性，她始終祗有哭泣，祇有悲哀，直到最後她畢竟什麽也没有﹁呐喊﹂出來。僅僅是一個曝露惡勢力的悲劇，雖然在劇中對惡勢力表示不滿，但終於是一首無力的哀歌。</p>
<p>至於在演出技巧上，總還算過得去的，雖然對於鏡頭的處置和剪接都不見佳，但是如雀籠。如蠟燭和雪茄等，都見聰明。固然整個的不見如何精采，但因爲是她的處女作，所以我們不必希望過高。</p>
<p>主角王瑩因爲導演指揮之失當，以及又是第一次上鏡頭，當然在表演上一定不會使我們十分滿意的。</p>
<p>其他方面如佈景，燈光，都不見壞。其中有幾個演員太過火，太文明戲化。總之，我們對於本劇不能完全滿意，但是對於本片作者諸人，却懷着重大的希望。努力罷！向着前途大步前進！</p>

<p>劇的本身：有那樣的黄金世界，社會，自然會産生出那樣的作品。丨女性眞不過是一個﹁紅花瓶﹂吧了﹁？﹂</p>
<p>高貴的男爵，自然會被許多女性追逐着，同時他的確可以有玩弄女性的資格。我希望看了這片後的女性有以自覺。</p>
<p>全劇可以說完全是對白。要是閉了眼睛，也可以當作ＲadioＤrama來聽。丨丨或許是利用戲劇的要素太過了吧？電影上特殊的技巧反成了補助役了。</p>
<p>演員：曼琳瑪許的確有適合的表演，尤其是由鄉姑，而到樸素的社會員，再到摩登的社會員，由醜而美的步驟，很能引動觀衆，丨丨這也可說是導演的力量。</p>
<p>華倫惠廉，也不失爲豪貴企業家。導演：除了上面所說的有近於舞台劇外，丨丨這只能說壞在劇本丨丨分幕與鏡頭是很經濟而又流暢的。不過這男爵的一個外婦，她每次打電話給男爵，總是在洗澡缸裏。未免過甚。要描寫這類的女子，方法正多。爲什麽不換幾個方式呢？　　光線與攝影技巧：這是值得種贊的，尤其是前幾叚中的重攝。</p>
<p>觀後：我覺得只是一些黄金世界中的一幕玩意兒。希望中國的女性，看了以後能作更一層的反省。你們願意做﹁紅花瓶﹂嗎？那麽你們便會失去了你們的靈魂。</p>

<p>月明公司從前也曾大俠或火燒的閙了一陣，不過這次顯然的改變了一個作風了。</p>
<p>牠的本事完全是舊小說的體裁，述說一對靑年男女的戀愛，但是有一個軍閥的少爺，看中女郎，設計將那男人陷害，危脅女郎從婚。女郎允婚以後，那小軍閥就免了靑年的死刑，改爲監禁。不料結婚之日，那靑年竟由獄中跑出，來打了一個落花流水，携女而去。軍閥方面，正待派人追捕，不料霹靂一聲，革命成功，軍閥失勢，於是有情人成了眷屬。這種本事，可以說祗合乎尋常低級趣味的人們的。</p>
<p>導演任彭年，是很有作爲的人，可惜爲環境所限，以致一無所成，他兼任分幕，也只能算勉强塞責。穿揷談不到什麽好。許多硬滑稽，也足能引起鄉嫗或小孩們的大笑。兩塲﹁打出手﹂，更顯俚俗。</p>
<p>主角鄔麗珠在武俠片中是極著名的。可是這裏一定要她做戲，眞難爲了她了。男角羅克明，他是許多小公司公用的唯一的小生。他表演上，還可以一看，但是至多也是矮子裏取長子。餘下的我不再談什麽了。</p>
<p>攝影很幼稚。光線呌我怎麽說呢？完全日光，邇反光板的光線却很少。外景還好。可是鏡頭太不濟事。内景簡陋，一望而知是假景。字幕太多，而且不是太文就是太俗</p>
<p>本事上，表演上，述事上，不合理，脫節處均多。但是我不一一提出討論了。</p>
<p>至於這片子的本身，我說牠在水平線以下。但是牠的趨向還不錯，在小公司裏不容易常見的。所以我希望小公司努力吧！</p>

<p>。　。劇意　牠只能算一本劇片而已，牠是純粹美國滑稽片，在中國人看來毫無趣味。不過我個人看見，陪審官親自調查案情，很顯出了美國對於民權的保障，還有就是﹁英美法﹂﹁陪審官制﹂的比較公允成續。</p>
<p>導演　這一張片子，假如没有導演，也一樣的可以攝製，只有一些穿揷，可以看出導演的手腕而已。</p>
<p>表演　再平常也没有，一個個演員都是以引人發笑爲前提，滑稽動作雖有不少可取，而在表情上却一無可談。内中也分不出賓主，全片用特寫的碎小鏡頭湊成的，所以十八九位角色，表演機會均等，大致可以說不錯。</p>
<p>其他　攝影很平常，不過碎小鏡頭。剪接很是生色，不能不說是分幕者的得法。光線極柔和。佈景方面，外景只有汽車在路上奔馳一幕，没什麽可說。内景只有四個屋子丨法院，陪審官會議室，旅館中，和被殺者的屋中丨這樣的簡單，是美國任何長片中所没有的。發音非常情楚。</p>
<p>個人批評　我只能承認牠是水平線以下的作品，内中不合理處，不勝枚舉，牠把一個美國法院，形容得毫無體統。一個個演員都明白，這是作戰，又有什麽藝術意味可說呢？</p>
<p>副本　第一部新聞還不錯，第二部滑稽短片，雖然是胡閙，可是很有幽默的意味，能呌人高興不少。</p>

<p>好萊塢的愛情影片是差不多有一種公式的。戀愛，戀愛，祇要是一男一女，碰在一起，就會一見生情，兩心繾綣起來；這其間也没有條件，也没有必然的因果。戀愛了以後，一定就要失戀，（男的或是女的）失戀了以後，一定了另外找到一個愛人，立刻又戀愛成功。於是，一個ＫissＥnd團圓大吉。這些公式，祇差大同小異。﹁牢獄餘生﹂也就是在這種公式底下産生出來的一張愛情影片。</p>
<p>故事是這樣的：勃南是一個年輕的礦工，他的母親在世時，很希望他做個工程師。經父親善意的栽培，不久就﹁如願以償﹂。這時，勃南的戀愛生活就開始了，他愛了女郎培爾，並且接着結了婚。但是，婚後的培爾忽然變了心，和勃南的朋友格羅芙發生暧昧。勃南發見了這秘密，一怒之下竟殺了他們，於是他下了獄。獄吏凑巧是格羅芙的兄弟，因此勃南吃了許多苦，最後逃了出來，逃避在一個農女的家裏，和那農女又立刻戀愛起來，駕着馬車，據說，是﹁共同創造新生活﹂去了。</p>
<p>這樣的故事，告訴了觀衆一點什麽是很顯然的。這裏面的所謂戀愛，我們實在不敢相信是事實，尤其是勃南逃出牢獄以後的戀愛，更其像是從天而降的。那農女爲什麽要突然愛一個落拓的囚徒呢？說是同情，那農女可眞比聖母還人道主義嗎？</p>
<p>導演的技巧是有相當成功的，全片的空氣被他製造得很緊張，連背景的選擇與劇情的情調也非常和諧，演員自然以飾勃南的ＰatＯＢrjen最成功，其他都還算稱職。片中動不動就Ｋiss，可說是一個﹁特點﹂。對於監牢中虐待罪犯的情形，　寫得有聲有色。這裏，倒敎我們看見了所謂﹁美利堅自由邦﹂的黑暗的片面！</p>

<p>這位吉普西少女，她血管裏充滿了跳躍與歡忭，她幻想着前途的快樂，幻想着自己要做喀德璘的替身，於是，她應承了，她答應一切的事情，都由蕭伐洛夫去擺佈。</p>

Luo said, "Since I took office as Foreign Minister a year ago, the Japanese have been thinking of slandering me. Those who hate me say that I am passive, and those who are jealous of me say that I will directly negotiate with Japan. Their intention is nothing more than to make me uneasy in my position. But the facts are there, what needs to be argued? The Japanese are trying to engage in direct negotiations with me to break their international difficulties, and we have lost territory in four provinces. Except for working hard to recover it, there is nothing to negotiate. As long as I am in office, I will do my best and will never be passive. You know that my eye disease is serious. Initially, I planned to go to Shanghai for treatment, but it was rumored that I was going to meet Yoshizawa under the pretext of illness. Now that I am being treated in Nanjing, it is said that I am being passive and will allow myself to go blind. In this national crisis, I hope the whole country will unite to resist the enemy and not be misled by enemy rumors." (13th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e48">The Murky Railway Dispute Between the Soviet Union, Japan, and the Puppet State <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>(1) The Issue of the Chinese Eastern Railway</p>
<p>After launching the September 18th Incident, Japan proceeded to plan an attack on Northern Manchuria. The first step in their conspiracy to invade Northern Manchuria was to isolate it from our country. The second step was to extend the exercise of Japanese military power. The third step was to seize the administrative power of Jilin and Heilongjiang. Finally, they seized the Chinese Eastern Railway for themselves, turning Vladivostok into a dead port. Japanese imperialism was then able to dominate the Northeast.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union recognized early on that Japan's conspiracy would be gradually realized. And, as they were in the midst of implementing the Five-Year Plan, they were unwilling to take drastic action externally. Therefore, although ominous news of military unrest spread between Harbin and Changchun, Moscow and Tokyo remained on friendly terms. However, the Soviet Far East military authorities were firm advocates of war. The Russian personnel of the Chinese Eastern Railway were also loyal to their homeland. Therefore, while maintaining peace on the one hand to deal with the Japanese warlords, they tried their best to preserve themselves on the other. As a result, 83 locomotives, 3,200 freight cars, and 190 passenger cars from the Chinese Eastern Railway were detained in Siberia. The Chinese Eastern Railway fell into a state of poor turnover and inefficient operation. The puppet regime established by Japan, on the orders of Mutō Nobuyoshi (Commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army), protested to the Soviet Union for the return of the vehicles. At the same time, they sealed off Manzhouli. As a result, the Soviet Union directly clashed with the puppet regime and indirectly deepened the rift with Japan.</p>
<p>The Chinese Eastern Railway was completed in December 1902 and officially began operations on July 1, 1903. After the Russian Revolution, through the 1924 "Sino-Soviet Agreement" and the "Feng-Russian Agreement," the railway became a purely Sino-Soviet joint commercial organization. Its business route is 1,721 kilometers long, including 240 kilometers from Harbin to Changchun, 935 kilometers from Harbin to Manzhouli, and 546 kilometers from Harbin to Suifenhe. The track gauge is five feet wide. It has a total of 500 locomotives, 608 passenger cars, and 9,149 freight cars. The total investment is estimated at 420 million gold rubles. If China and the Soviet Union could maintain good friendly relations, this route would be sufficient to help develop the Heilongjiang River basin, making it easier for immigrants from within the Great Wall. The Tao'ang Railway would also be able to smooth the connection between the three provinces and link them to within the Great Wall. There was great potential. Unfortunately, the Northeast authorities took inappropriate measures, and when the September 18th Incident occurred, they were unable to respond, resulting in the loss of the three provinces. The benefits of the Chinese Eastern Railway were also lost. Although the confrontation between the Soviet Union and Japan was bound to become increasingly acute, there was still our country in between to serve as a buffer, which could reduce the explosive nature of the powder keg in the three northeastern provinces.</p>
<p>(2) Japan's Intentions in Attacking</p>
<p>Now that our country has lost sovereignty over the territory of the Northeast, the fact that the three northeastern provinces are a world powder keg is even more obvious. Although Japan's invasion of Manchuria is calling on the world to prevent "reddening," the nations are also doing their utmost to prevent a direct war between China and Japan. If Japan increases the explosives in this powder keg, its explosion will be even more difficult to avoid.</p>
<p>Before invading Rehe, Japan was already actively preparing to control transportation in the Northeast, which was especially obvious. The South Manchuria Railway increased its capital to 800 million. All railways within the three northeastern provinces were brought under the control of the South Manchuria Railway. They had already made several unofficial proposals to buy the Chinese Eastern Railway. At that time, the Soviet Union remained silent and ignored them, so they proceeded with their counter-measures.</p>
<p>First, in the shortest possible time, before June of this year, they will complete the Jihui Railway, so that all agricultural products from southern Jilin will flow out through the Jihui Railway and be exported from Chongjin in Korea, to control Vladivostok. At the same time, they are also building the new Yanji-Hailin and Hailin-Sanxing railways, which run directly through the north and south of Jilin, cutting off the Chinese Eastern Railway to the east. Future development will be entirely in the hands of the Japanese.</p>
<p>Second, they will connect the Qiqihar-Keshan Railway with the Tao'ang Railway via the Sitao Railway to connect with the South Manchuria Railway, so that the products east of the Xing'an Mountains and west of Hulan will be absorbed by Dalian.</p>
<p>With the impact of these two routes, the economic value of the Chinese Eastern Railway will naturally decline. The route out of Vladivostok will also be hijacked by Dalian and Chongjin. Japanese imperialists will be able to exert their monopolistic instincts and realize their ambitions to annex the Northeast.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the urgency of the situation was beyond their expectations. If the financial panic in the United States does not erupt dramatically, then the resumption of diplomatic relations between the United States and the Soviet Union may be realized sooner. Japan's hostile behavior towards the Soviet Union will also be delayed. Recently, Anglo-Soviet relations have worsened due to the arrest of the six engineers, threatening to sever diplomatic relations. In order to curry favor with the British Empire and cut off US-Soviet relations, Japan has to use its diplomatic skills to show its sincerity in blockading the Soviet Union and act as a vanguard for capitalist countries. Therefore, it is publicizing the Soviet Union's preparations for war in a big way, and will use force to seal off Manzhouli, and even take the Chinese Eastern Railway by force. The Soviet Union, except for expressing its position on the return of vehicles, has been very silent. Why is this? It is because they are well aware of Japan's smokescreen tactics. Are we not seeing that Tokyo is still trying its best to be friendly with the Soviet Union? It is not Japan that is coming forward to dispute with the Soviet Union, but the Manchurian puppet state created by Japan. Even if it unfortunately leads to a stalemate, Japan has plenty of room to maneuver. It may even claim to be mediating. Therefore, although a Japanese-Soviet war is ultimately inevitable, at present, it is limited by circumstances and will only be a diplomatic conflict in the shortest possible time.</p>

<p>Puppet State Asks Russia for Cars, No Official Response Received</p>
<p>Rumor Has It Russia Only Willing to Return Detained Freight Cars</p>
<p>Russo-Japanese Conflict Seems Inevitable</p>
<p>(Harbin) Today, news from Soviet Russia indicates that there are signs of military activity in the Soviet territory near Manchouli. White Russian newspapers speculate that this is a precautionary measure by Soviet Russia, concerned about potential unexpected developments in the railway dispute between "Manchuria" and Russia. Li Shaogeng, the superintendent of the Chinese Eastern Railway, sent a letter to the Soviet authorities requesting the return of locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars. To date, no official reply has been received. It is rumored that Soviet Russia is only willing to return the freight cars but refuses to return the locomotives. The current state of the Chinese Eastern Railway remains unrestored, and trains are frequently attacked by bandits. It has recently been learned that the tracks near Taipingling were dismantled by bandits, causing a west-bound passenger train to derail at that location. The bandits then opened fire on the train, killing three and injuring many others. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>(Changchun) After the puppet state of "Manchukuo" cut off the Chinese Eastern Railway, the Soviet authorities not only did not stop detaining cars but also demanded that Manchukuo lift the blockade. At the same time, they detain several freight cars daily at the eastern border and transport them through Boli (Khabarovsk) onto the Ussuri Railway, changing their color. As a result, the Chinese Eastern Railway is short of many vehicles, hindering the transportation of goods. The Ministry of Communications of the puppet state of Manchukuo has decided to lodge a serious protest with the Ussuri Railway Bureau, demanding a show of sincerity, or else effective measures will be implemented. (Japanese United Press, 13th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Chinese Eastern Railway Chairman Koznesov gave the following informal reply to Li Shaogeng, the representative of Manchukuo, regarding the puppet state of "Manchukuo's" final ultimatum yesterday: 600 freight cars have been returned at Manchouli and Pokrani Creek, and more will be returned gradually in the future. However, locomotives are the property of the Soviet Russian Federation, so it is difficult to comply with the request for their return. (Dentsu, 13th)</p>
<p>(Changchun) Because the Soviet side transported various Chinese Eastern Railway cars to Soviet territory, the puppet Manchukuo's Ministry of Communications decisively blocked the connection of vehicles at Manchouli by force. On the 10th, Chinese Eastern Railway Chairman Koznesov issued the following protest to the puppet Manchukuo's Ministry of Communications: "The Manchukuo Ministry of Communications' blockade of the Chinese Eastern Railway at Manchouli has severed connections between the Ussuri and Transbaikal Railways, making transportation impossible. This clearly violates Article 10 of the 1896 regulations for the construction and operation of the Chinese Eastern Railway, and Article 1 of the Russo-Fengtian Agreement also confirmed these old regulations. Therefore, from this perspective, the actions of the Manchukuo Ministry of Communications are a clear violation of the treaty, and it is hoped that the railway blockade will be lifted immediately."

<p>The US Sends Notes, Not Inviting All Nations to Explain</p>
<p>Requests Deliberation Through Normal Diplomatic Channels</p>
<p>Britain, the US, and France Plan to Hold Fireside Chats First</p>
<p>(Washington) It has now been confirmed that the countries specifically invited to participate in the Washington talks are only eleven: France, Britain, Germany, Italy, China, Japan, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Canada. The other forty-four countries with ambassadors or ministers in Washington will exchange opinions with Secretary of State Hull or, if necessary, with President Roosevelt, through their respective ambassadors or ministers. This morning, the State Department sent notes to each of these countries, requesting that they consult with the United States through diplomatic channels. A personal letter from Hull was also sent simultaneously with the note, explaining that the purpose of this procedure is to save time and stating that the State Department hopes that countries will avoid misunderstandings or incorrect interpretations of the attitude adopted by the United States. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt suggested today to hold a fireside chat with British Prime Minister MacDonald and French representative Herriot at the White House. President Roosevelt proposed that visiting heads of government should reside at the White House, while cabinet members should reside at their embassies. Since Herriot is neither a head of government nor a cabinet member, it is widely expected that he will use the French embassy as his residence. Although a round table conference is now out of the question, President Roosevelt is also not opposed to meeting with MacDonald and Herriot simultaneously. According to Roosevelt, it would be good if everyone gathered around the fireplace at the White House. It is reported that several countries have expressed dissatisfaction for not receiving invitations to participate in the Washington talks. The State Department therefore sent letters to the forty-four countries not sending representatives today, inviting their diplomatic representatives to exchange views. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Although the US government has decided to hold separate economic talks with representatives from various countries, there will be one exception. If French representative Herriot arrives in the United States before British Prime Minister MacDonald returns home, President Roosevelt will hold an informal meeting with Herriot before convening a three-way meeting with representatives from Britain and France to discuss various important political issues. Roosevelt believes that Britain, the United States, and France, as democratic countries, should trust and cooperate with each other. He therefore wants to hold a kind of unofficial meeting. Roosevelt previously served as the Brazilian Foreign Minister and US Secretary of State in 1913. Hote, a skilled interpreter fluent in French, will be the translator. (Havas, 13th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government has decided to appoint Ishii Kikujiro as the representative to the Washington Economic Preparatory Conference. It is reported that Ishii has also accepted, and a formal appointment will be made after approval at the cabinet meeting on the 14th. Kagamui Kenkichi was originally designated as the representative from the economic sector, but since Kagamui did not wish to take the post, he was replaced by Fukai An'go, the Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan. Ambassadors Matsudaira and Debuchi will serve as deputies, and officials such as Tsushima (Finance Ministry Official), Kato (Councilor), and Kawai (Minister) will serve as specialized committee members.

<p>(Moscow) The newspaper "Industrialization," the organ of the People's Committee for Heavy Industry, published an editorial discussing the upcoming Washington talks. It stated, "The intention of the US government is not only to discuss the war debt issue but also to comprehensively study global economic problems and various political events that extend beyond the scope of the future World Economic Conference. This can be seen from the composition of the list of countries invited by the United States. Since the idea of the four major European powers being in charge has emerged, American public opinion may consider it to be a new attempt to establish a 'European common front.' The initiation of these Washington talks is likely related to the four-power treaty plan. The United States has widely invited various countries, but excluded Soviet Russia. Russian public opinion is very puzzled. To study world economic problems, the participation of Soviet Russia is necessary for its success. For example, the International Wheat Agreement cannot be established without the joint participation of major wheat-producing countries such as Soviet Russia. We speculate that the situation in Washington will be one of the following: either the participating countries are not seriously engaged, or the countries want to achieve a certain purpose that is inconvenient for Russia to hear. Based on our past experience, we can believe that the Washington talks are definitely an attempt to resolve the conflicts between capitalist countries and seek harm to Soviet Russia. If this is not the case, why was Soviet Russia not invited to participate?" (Havas, 12th)</p>

If this policy is implemented, international currency should be immediately inflated by 35 percent, and the value of each country's gold reserves could also increase by the same percentage simultaneously. It is said that this may also be raised for discussion at the upcoming World Economic Conference. (Kokumin, 12th)</p>
<p>(Washington) US experts preparing for commercial negotiations between the United States and Canada intend to ask Canada to modify the Ottawa Agreement so that the United States and Canada can establish a tariff agreement based on mutual concessions. The Ottawa Agreement grants various conveniences to British goods imported into Canada, which is detrimental to US goods. The difficulty of future negotiations lies in this point. As for the request for modification, it is planned to be discussed by representatives from the United States and Canada after British Prime Minister MacDonald arrives in the United States and expresses his views.

Therefore, the Central Government plans to invite Song Ziwen to attend. However, Song has recently been unwell and has taken a week's leave to recuperate in Shanghai. A decision will only be made after he returns to Nanjing. Sun Ke also said that the Washington Conference convened by the United States is purely to discuss world economic problems, so the attending representatives must be proficient in financial and economic matters to be successful. He has never studied financial and other issues and cannot undertake this important task. He believes that it would be most appropriate for Minister Song to attend, which would greatly benefit China's economic future. (Special Dispatch, 13th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Communications has decided to build a broadcasting station in Kyushu at a cost of 1 million Japanese yen.

<p>(Nanjing) Listeners of the Fukuoka Broadcasting Bureau found that the Fukuoka broadcast could not be heard completely and only heard the broadcast from the Nanjing Broadcasting Bureau. After investigation, it was found that the Nanjing Broadcasting Bureau used a wavelength of 667 kilocycles, which was very similar to Fukuoka's 680 kilocycles, resulting in the Japanese broadcast being interfered with by the Nanjing broadcast. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is protesting to the Nanjing side based on international law regarding wireless radio. Although the Chinese side replied that it would change the wavelength, there is no prospect of it being realized. Therefore, the Ministry of Communications plans to counter this by building a 100-kilowatt broadcasting station to launch a broadcasting war with Nanjing. (Dentsu, 13th)</p>

<p>Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Sends Instructions to Matsudaira</p>
<p>Requests the British Government to Relax Tariffs</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The British government has notified Japan that the Indo-Japanese Commercial Treaty will expire and be abolished in October of this year. Yesterday afternoon, as a result of discussions by Vice Minister Arida and Director of the Bureau of Commerce Kurisu, it was agreed that although Japan could not request the withdrawal of the notification according to the provisions of the treaty, the result, whether it was the abolition of the most-favored-nation treatment or the imposition of high anti-dumping duties on Japanese exports, would be undesirable for Indo-Japanese trade and for the feelings of the Japanese people towards Britain. It was decided to request the British government to reconsider based on this view. Yesterday, instructions to the following effect were sent to Matsudaira, the ambassador to Britain: (1) The Japanese government will endeavor to ensure self-respect among industry players and export controls; (2) After the abolition of the commercial treaty, drastic taxation should not be imposed solely on Japanese exports; (3) Exports such as three-in-one soil do not threaten the Indian market and must be exempted from anti-dumping duties and continue to be granted most-favored-nation treatment as before.

<p>(Nanjing) According to the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, the Japanese government plans to vigorously advocate the principle of freedom of commerce at the Washington Conference and oppose countries raising tariffs on Japanese goods and imposing anti-dumping duties. The content of the so-called principle of freedom of commerce is: (1) Cancellation of exceptions to the most-favored-nation clause, such as the British Ottawa Agreement; (2) Tariffs should be based on mutual benefit between the two countries; (3) Protective tariffs should be negotiated through diplomatic means and implemented after mutual understanding is reached; (4) Removal of tariff barriers.

The warehouses are full of goods, which shows that the so-called prosperous market is still extremely depressed. (Hua Lian, 13th)</p>

<p>Strongly Argues for the Necessity of Overcoming Trade Barriers in the Americas</p>
<p>Frequent War Disasters in South America Set Back Civilization</p>
<p>国民 Twelve Washington dispatch: Today was one of the busiest days for US President Roosevelt since the end of the banking crisis. He went to the board of directors of the Association of American Republics in the morning to give a speech. As today is Pan-American Day, Roosevelt took the opportunity to strongly argue for the necessity of overcoming man-made trade barriers in the Americas. Previously, Latin American countries had launched the most fierce criticism of the US tariff act, and Roosevelt had also acknowledged that high tariffs hindered trade between the United States and South American countries. Therefore, at today's speech, he first announced that the time had come to overcome trade barriers and allow the goods of each other to flow back and forth on a fair and beneficial basis. One of the most difficult problems between the United States and various South American countries is overproduction. For example, the United States and Argentina both have large surpluses of wheat, while Brazil is saddened by surpluses of coffee. All urgently need to seek smooth trade.</p>
<p>Reuters Washington telegram: President Roosevelt, in his speech commemorating Pan-American Day, stated that the undeclared wars between Bolivia and Paraguay and between Chile and Peru are acts of regression. The governments of the Americas should each take the initiative as soon as possible to completely abolish all unnecessary and man-made barriers that hinder the commercial prosperity between the peoples of the American republics.</p>
<h3 id="e89">US Plan to Save Military Spending: Hagood Explains to Congress <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>国民 Twelve Washington dispatch: Major General Hagood stated to the US House of Representatives Army Committee today on a plan for national defense and saving military expenses, saying that it had been submitted to the White House for a long time, but the President neither approved nor rejected it. Hagood was summoned to the House for consultations on opinions on saving military expenses, and immediately stated the urgent need for suitable defense on both the land and sea. His plan (1) would abolish the Philippine patrol force; (2) withdraw all land armies stationed in China; (3) US coastal artillery units and field artillery units should be merged into a single military unit; (4) Add to the naval defenses of each port to reach pre-war strength; (5) Continue building warships to at least match the strongest navy in the world; (6) Abolish dozens of military agencies to streamline administrative procedures; (7) Make the Reserve Officers' Training Corps the foundation of the national defense system. Hagood firmly believes that there is no need to station a land army in China today, and since the Philippines has an independence bill, it should be allowed to train its own land army. As for the Philippine patrol force, its nature is equivalent to the national defense team stationed in each state within the United States, except that the patrol force is a paid army, with more than 6,000 soldiers on duty year-round, all of whom are Filipinos, and most of the officers are Americans. Military salaries are paid by the US central government. According to Hagood's estimate, after abolishing useless teams and streamlining roundabout procedures, 50 million yuan in military expenses can be saved annually, with no impact on strength.</p>

A woman's appointment as minister is truly an innovation in the United States. President Roosevelt also appointed Boston Mayor Curley as Ambassador to Poland today.</p>

<h3 id="e92">Continued Trial of British Engineers in Moscow <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Reuter, Moscow, 12th: One of the most intriguing cases in history continued this afternoon in the Blue Hall of the Trade Union Building in Moscow.</p>
<p>The indictment, in which the Soviet Union accuses six British engineers of committing the following five crimes: (1) belonging to a counter-revolutionary party; (2) collecting secret military and civilian information; (3) participating in sabotage activities; (4) bribing Russian engineers and workers to exchange for espionage and sabotage work; (5) bribing Russian engineers to cover up defects in the installation of the Wickers Company equipment. The document is seventy-seven pages long and was read aloud this morning.</p>
<p>The defendant, Macdonald, confessed to his guilt, while the other five British engineers pleaded not guilty. The indictment alleges that Macdonald confessed to engaging in espionage activities under the instructions of Thornton and Monkhouse. The evidence presented this morning was based entirely on the confessions of the defendants after their arrest on March 12 and the reports of the Soviet Expert Committee's investigation of certain documents.</p>
<p>During the resumption of the hearing in the afternoon, the first witness was a Russian named Gusev, who had red hair and a trembling voice. He was questioned by Russian prosecutor Vyshinsky. Gusev claimed that he belonged to the White Army and began counter-revolutionary work after meeting with Wickers Company employees in 1929. He was instructed by Macdonald to provide information about the factory, especially focusing on military installations and the types of shells they manufactured. After speaking, Gusev left the witness stand.</p>
<p>In the silent atmosphere, the prosecutor called Macdonald to the stand and questioned him, saying, "Is it true that you know Gusev?" Macdonald replied, "Yes, we were good friends in 1930." The prosecutor asked, "Why did you instruct him to provide information?" Macdonald answered, "I did it for my own purposes." Macdonald's calm and composed tone aroused the emotions of the courtroom observers. The judge quickly rang the bell to instruct the audience to maintain order and remain silent. Gusev then took the stand again to provide a detailed account of how he sabotaged machinery and sought information, stating that he placed metallic objects in the machinery at the Slato-Ustes Electric Plant and that Macdonald was aware of this plan. At this point, the prosecutor turned to Macdonald and asked, "Is this true?" Macdonald replied, "Yes, it is true." Macdonald also admitted to giving Gusev 3,500 rubles. Gusev continued to say that he used go-slow tactics to delay production at the Slato-Ustes Electric Plant. However, Macdonald said he knew nothing about this. Gusev also stated that the purpose of the go-slow tactics was to harm the efficiency of the Soviet military. When he served in other power plants, he introduced other employees to Macdonald, and Macdonald recommended him to Thornton as someone who could provide information. Thornton, hearing this testimony, expressed indignation. Gusev continued, saying that after Macdonald left Slato-Ustes, they corresponded under assumed names, and the intermediary was a woman named Li Bofa. Macdonald also ordered Wickers Company secretary Gadusov to send instructions to Gusev, but not using Gusev's real name. After hearing this testimony, Macdonald looked down and, in answering the prosecutor's questions, said that he had sent letters to Gusev, but it was for company matters and not to instruct him to provide information. At this point, the prosecutor wanted to prove that Thornton was aware that Gusev was engaged in espionage activities under Macdonald's instructions, so he called Thornton to the stand. Thornton claimed that he met Gusev in a tavern in the Ural Mountains.</p>

<p>Representative of Hungarian Prime Minister Arrived Yesterday</p>
<p>Reuter, Rome, 12th: According to tonight's news, Germany intends to form another Catholic Party, but it has not been approved by the Pope. The Pope is still taking a wait-and-see approach to the National Socialist Party. It is not yet possible to predict whether German Deputy Prime Minister Papen will be able to negotiate an agreement between the Holy See and all of Germany to replace the existing agreements between the Holy See and various states. Fascist leaders from various countries will meet here this week. In addition to representatives from Germany and Austria, Sir Oswald Mosley, a supporter of British Fascism, will arrive on Friday. A representative of the Hungarian Prime Minister arrived today and plans to stay for a week. Havas, Rome, 13th: The talks between Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Deputy Foreign Minister Suvich were about the overall situation in Austria. The main purpose of the talks was economic issues. This is the first time that Mussolini and Dollfuss have met as heads of state. Both of them are of common origin and can fully understand each other.</p>
<p>National, Rome, 12th: Papen and Goering separately met with the Roman Pope today. The Pope talked with each of them for about half an hour. It is said that Goering mentioned to the Pope the political situation in Germany and that the current government relies on public opinion, so its strength is very strong. Papen and Goering then attended a banquet hosted by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. The attendees were all famous figures of the time. Catholic Center Party leader Gasper also was in Vatican City and had a long talk with the Roman Pope this afternoon, intending to change his policies to suit the times.

<p>Reuter, Sofia, 12th: The Bulgarian Parliament today followed in Hitler's footsteps and proposed a motion to suspend the thirty-one members of the Labor Party from the Parliament. After a heated debate, it was passed by a majority vote. The Parliament has a total of 274 seats, and the Labor Party occupies 31 seats. The Labor Party members had anticipated this move in advance, so they had already decided to give up their seats in the Parliament and declared that they would expand their propaganda work among the public. Today's government action was taken in view of the recent activities of the Labor Party and the discovery of some communist organizations. When the Parliament was debating, armed cavalry patrolled the entire city of Sofia. Recently, some Labor Party members were arrested for inciting actions and have been sentenced to ten years in prison.</p>

<p>National, Beijing, 13th: According to reports, the Belgian government sent a memorandum to the French, British, and Italian governments, expressing its support in principle for the Four-Power Pact. It is said that the main conditions it put forward are that Article 19 of the League of Nations Covenant regarding the final revision of the treaty should be respected, and the security guarantees of the integrity of Belgian territory and political independence in the so-called Locarno Treaty should be maintained.</p>

<p>TASS, Moscow, 12th: The Soviet government newspaper "Izvestia" published an article quoting a statement from the Italian newspaper "Il Popolo d'Italia," pointing out the anti-Soviet color of the recent so-called Four-Power Pact. It is said that the Italian newspaper has a close relationship with the government in fact, so the statements of "Il Popolo d'Italia" must be issued by those who are familiar with the policies of the Italian authorities. The Four-Power Pact is already on the verge of failure, but its initiators are still trying to inject an anti-Soviet stimulant to save its failure. The statements of "Il Popolo d'Italia" cannot but be considered related to Papen's trip to Rome, as this person is the most suitable tool for carrying out anti-Soviet plans. However, we must reiterate that the failure of the previous armed intervention in the Soviet Union has failed to give these gentlemen an objective lesson. Even if they are unwilling or unable to recognize the strength of the Soviet Union, we are already substantially prepared to repel any army that attempts to enter Soviet territory.</p>

<p>Severe Back Pain, Briefly Resting in Tianjin</p>
<p>Resigned from Chairman of Chahar to Focus on Military Affairs</p>
<p>If the War is Prolonged, Japanese Advances Will Be More Difficult</p>
<p>Tang Yulin Cables Song, Awaiting Orders to Resist Japan</p>
<p>Ping News: After Song Zheyuan telegraphed the Central Government to earnestly resign from the chairmanship of Chahar, he went to Tianjin for recuperation on the night of the 9th due to severe back pain. In the past two days, telegrams of condolences have poured in from all sides. It is said that Song's back pain is still severe and should recover in about three to four days. He Yingqin, Chairman of the Military Branch of the Military Affairs Committee, also sent a representative to offer condolences. As for Song's resignation from the chairmanship of Chahar, there has been a turning point. During this period, the Central Government does not advocate many changes to the local officials in North China. Chairman Chiang also sent a telegram from Nanchang to express his condolences for Song's illness.</p>
<p>Yang Zhaogeng, Secretary-General of the Chahar Provincial Government, arrived in Ping yesterday morning (10th) from Chahar and is scheduled to visit Song Zheyuan in Tianjin within a few days to report on provincial affairs. According to Yang, Mr. Feng (Yuxiang) has no plans to leave Chahar and spends his daily life reading and writing. There is no recruitment of provincial troops in Chahar. What is rumored outside is not true. The eastern front of Chahar is consolidated, and there are no traces of the enemy. The enemy in the Weichang Jingpeng area is the rebel troops of Cui Xingwu. Cone Mountain is the bandit army of Liu Guitang. Near Fengning, there are the puppet army of Zhang HaiPeng and the cavalry of Motegi, which are guerrilla in nature. Recently, they went to Fengning once and were transferred elsewhere for some reason. There is no contact along the eastern line of Chahar, but Japanese planes harass from time to time. At 11:00 AM the day before yesterday, an enemy plane dropped seven bombs on Duolun, killing four merchants and civilians, without causing any damage.</p>
<p>Tianjin News: A reporter interviewed Mr. Song Zheyuan yesterday, who had returned from the front line. According to him, due to the recurrence of old back pain, he felt uncomfortable sitting and lying down, so he took advantage of the ceasefire at the front to come to Tianjin for a short rest. He will return to the defense in four or five days. If the front line is urgent, he will return quickly within a day. At present, the enemy on the Luowenyu front has retreated to Shouwangfen, 120 miles away from Zunhua, to build fortifications. On the Xifengkou front, the two armies are still facing each other on the mountain. The number of Japanese troops left there is very small, only a few hundred people can be seen from the mountains, but they still bomb our rear from time to time with aircraft. A few days ago, several Japanese planes flew to Zunhua to drop bombs, killing several county residents and four of our soldiers. Currently, our □ army has reinforced to □□□. As for the position of Chairman of Chahar, it was originally beyond my ability to handle. I had to uphold the times with the government's orders. I have repeatedly resigned last year, but they were not approved. Now, due to military issues, I must command at the front. I have no time to take care of government affairs. I am deeply afraid of delaying for too long, leading to the stagnation of government affairs. Therefore, I firmly request to resign from the position of Chairman of Chahar so that I can focus on military affairs. The military situation in the east has been better than in the past few days. Earlier, because our army was weak, we retreated slightly in Luandong and planned to have a decisive battle in □□. Later, because the puppet army pressed on step by step, we greatly reinforced and successively recovered Haiyang, Liujiang, and other places. The puppet army could not support and retreated into Shimenzhai. Our army is still in pursuit. The Japanese army recently transferred the 16th Division to Jinzhou, intending to participate in the Luandong War. But in terms of military strength, even if the Japanese army increases by one division, we still have the advantage. If the Japanese army is determined to take Luandong, they will definitely concentrate their forces in the next few days and decide the outcome within ten days. If they still use the puppet army to harass, waiting for us to be exhausted, and then launch a general attack, we are also prepared and will never be taken advantage of. If the war can be extended to May or June, when the green screen of tall crops arises, the Japanese army's attack will be more difficult. Currently, our army is actively organizing transportation. All railways and car roads will be sorted out recently to facilitate military transportation. Tang Yulin sent a telegram to me yesterday, saying that the loss of Chengde was sudden and I was ashamed to the country. Now, I am leading the division and brigade and concentrating in the □□□□□ area, awaiting orders to resist Japan. It is also heard that Tang's troops are still many and are currently being replenished and reorganized. (April 11)</p>

<p>Set up a Military Command Headquarters for Suppressing Communist Bandits in Fuzhou</p>
<p>The Bandits Can Be Eliminated in the Shortest Time</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Chairman Chiang believes that the communist bandits are now completely concentrated in the Yihuang, Le'an, Jinxi, and Yongfeng areas, which is a good opportunity to gather and annihilate them. Yesterday, he specially summoned Chen Cheng, the Commander of the Central Route, to the province to inquire about the detailed situation on the Fuzhou River front. Chen arrived in the province in the afternoon to meet with Chiang. Chiang then summoned Liu Zhi, He Guoguang, Chen Cheng, and other generals to the Science Museum to discuss military plans, which lasted for three or four hours. The rectification, allocation, defense, and reorganization of the various units, as well as the combat plan, have all been decided. Chiang also believes that Fuzhou is the center of eastern Jiangxi and an important screen for the provincial capital. The communist bandits are trying to make a desperate gamble here. The current situation is extremely tense. Therefore, after instructing Chen Cheng in person, he ordered him to return to the defense to command everything. At the same time, he ordered Liu Zhi to replace Chiang and go to Fuzhou to take command. After receiving the order, Liu also set off on the morning of the 12th and organized the "Henan Pacification Commissioner's Office, temporarily兼Military Command Headquarters for Suppressing Communist Bandits on the Fuhe and Xinhe Rivers" in Fuzhou to unify military command in eastern Jiangxi. The reason is that the bandits who invaded Linchuan Dongxiang this time are the bandits of Fang Zhimin from Xinhe and the bandits of Zhu Mao from the Fuhe River. Liu, who is about to depart, issued a statement saying: "I am ordered to go to Fuzhou to suppress the bandits. Because I have to return to Henan, I am unable to take on any position in name. However, I cannot shirk my responsibility to serve my hometown. I will set up a field headquarters in Jiangxi in the name of the Director of Henan Pacification and depart for the front line tomorrow to command the bandit suppression military. Chairman Chiang will not leave Jiangxi for the time being. Chairman Chiang has a thorough plan for this suppression, and the communist bandits can be eliminated in the shortest time. As for the joint suppression by troops from Hunan, Fujian, and Guangdong, the Hunan army has arrived near Ji'an and Jishui. The Guangdong and Fujian armies are also advancing and will reach their destinations in the near future." (April 11)</p>

<h3 id="e100">Control Yuan Impeaches Wei Daoming <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Enumerates Facts of Bribery and Illegal Acts</p>
<p>Requests the Government to Impose Disciplinary Action According to Law</p>
<p>Control Committee member Shao Hongji has proposed the impeachment of former Nanjing Mayor Wei Daoming for accepting bribes, engaging in corruption, violating laws, and dereliction of duty in the handling of the Nanjing water pipe project, as well as for forging receipts and embezzling funds with former Finance Bureau chiefs Qi Xu, Wang Renlin, and Cheng Yuanfan. The Control Yuan has issued the case to Control Committee members Xiong Yuxi and others for investigation, which has been confirmed. They have submitted a request to the National Government to forward it to the Committee for the Punishment of Political Officials for handling according to law. The original proposal and investigation report are listed below.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Control Yuan Submission <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the matter of submission, according to the impeachment by Control Committee member Shao Hongji against former Nanjing Mayor Wei Daoming for accepting bribes, engaging in corruption, violating laws, and dereliction of duty, the Control Yuan has assigned Control Committee members Xiong Yuxi, Zheng Lusheng, and Yang Pusheng to investigate. Now, according to the report, it is believed that disciplinary action should be taken. Therefore, the original case documents are copied and submitted to the Government for review and forwarded to the Committee for the Punishment of Political Officials for handling, which would be for the public convenience. Sincerely submitted to Lin, Chairman of the National Government, including a copy of the original impeachment document, a copy of the original investigation report, Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Original Impeachment Document <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the matter of proposal, it is found that the capital city has been operating the waterworks for nearly two years. Citizens are eager to release the water as soon as possible to emphasize hygiene. Last month, when the main pipeline was just installed and the water pressure was tested, water pipe bursts were repeatedly discovered, indicating that the quality of the materials was poor. It is rumored that the person in charge of purchasing materials贪图回扣and engaged in corruption, involving four to fifty hundred thousand yuan. Committee member Shao Hongji feared that the rumors might not be credible, so he went to the Municipal Government to review the files and secretly investigated separately. Now, the identified doubts are recorded as follows: (1) The contract for water pipes and accessories was signed in April of the 20th year of the Republic of China by former Nanjing Mayor Wei Daoming with the Shanghai Paris Industrial Electrical Factory, the agent of the French德蒙松铁厂. An order was placed for a batch of water pipes and accessories, totaling US$350,000, half in cash and half in promissory notes. The promissory notes were also specified in the appendix to the contract to be exchanged for US$6,000 per month, starting from January 30th of the 20th year of the Republic of China, and exchanged in order for 30 months (estimated to be exchanged in full by July 30th of the 22nd year of the Republic of China). Unexpectedly, before February of the 21st year of the Republic of China, former Mayor Wei Daoming had already exchanged US$75,000 in cash, and only a balance of US$1,785 remains. It is found that the intention of the above installment payments was to limit the speed of delivery. If there was a delay, the fine would be deducted from this payment. The Mayor did not wait for the order to be delivered in full, nor did he make the payments monthly. Instead, he prepaid all the payments before the due date, which obviously involves other circumstances. This is a point of suspicion. (2) The contract stipulates that the delivery period should be before October 10th of the 20th year of the Republic of China, and that all goods should be delivered to the designated location (Nanjing) in three installments, with a fine of US$200 per day for delays. It is found that the factory shipped in nine batches. The first six batches were delivered on time. The last three batches were delivered one month late. In addition, some accessories have not been delivered and have not responded to repeated reminders, resulting in delayed installation. It is found that the contract clearly stipulates penalties for delays. Mayor Wei Daoming did not perform the penalties as stipulated in the contract. He did not deduct the unpaid payments but issued promissory notes in advance, which is incomprehensible. This is the second point of suspicion. (3) Once the installed water pipes were tested with water pressure, more than 30 of them burst. It is found that there are many pinholes in the delivered water pipes and accessories. Not only is the quality of the materials poor, but the thinnest part of the burst water pipes, as examined by the Bureau of Public Works, is only more than 13 millimeters, which differs by 15% from the original contract specification of 16 millimeters. The factory relies on the fact that the payments have been received and there is no guarantee, so it delays in replacing and compensating. Who should be held responsible for this? This is the third point of suspicion. (4) After reading the contract for ordering water pipes and accessories, "Article 13. Bank Guarantee: Within 10 days after signing the contract, Party B (the factory) shall provide a bank guarantee acceptable to Party A (the government) to fulfill all the conditions of this contract." It is found that there is only an original English letter from the factory and a draft in the original file, and no formal guarantee. Therefore, the factory does not perform the contract, and our Municipal Government has repeatedly failed to respond to reminders. The public has suffered considerable losses as a result. Who should be held responsible for this? Furthermore, it is rumored that Mayor Wei withdrew a formal guarantee certificate from a certain bank before leaving office and returned it to the factory after receiving a bribe. This is not without cause. This is the fourth point of suspicion. In summary of the above-mentioned facts, it is found that former Nanjing Mayor Wei Daoming (a student who studied in France) did not use the bidding method for all water pipes, and the materials ordered were not only of poor quality but also did not meet the thickness specified in the original contract. The water pipes and other items were delayed in delivery, and instead, the payments were prepaid. It is no wonder that the citizens slander him. The most important thing is that the bank guarantee certificate for Party B to fulfill this contract was privately withdrawn, only seeking to enrich himself and disregarding the rights of the public. His bribery, corruption, violation of law, and dereliction of duty are obvious. Therefore, an impeachment is filed according to law, requesting that former Nanjing Mayor Wei Daoming be immediately transferred for disciplinary action, that his criminal part be handed over to the court for strict interrogation, and that he be ordered to compensate for public losses to maintain official integrity and serve as a warning to those who are greedy. This is submitted to the Dean for review and implementation. Shao Hongji, Inspector. (To be continued)</p>

Unexpectedly, when they left, they suddenly encountered several lake bandits who kidnapped Wang Jiao and the other two. Wang was shot dead on the spot, and his body was left in Taihu Lake. Shen and Fang pleaded and were spared. The 2nd Company of the Provincial Security Team stationed in Nanku heard the news and pursued, but the bandits had already fled far away.</p>

<p>Central Committee member Li Liejun sent a telegram to the Central Party Headquarters the day before yesterday, requesting that an order be issued to all party, government, and military organs across the country to implement guarantees of freedom of assembly, association, speech, and publication. The original telegram read: "Respectfully to the Central Party Headquarters: Since the Central Executive Committee decided on March 30th to convene a temporary representative assembly and discuss the early convening of the National Assembly, the general public has felt that there is still a glimmer of hope for the political future. To realize this hope, since the Central Committee has decided to make the government open and gather the wisdom of the people to jointly decide on national affairs, it should first demonstrate sincerity to the world. This is what the people desire, and this is what the government should strive for. Therefore, the freedom of assembly, association, speech, and publication for the people, which has been declared repeatedly, should not be reduced to empty words again. Otherwise, if the people cannot even assemble and cannot even speak, how can they contribute their wisdom, let alone save the country? On the 5th of this month, the two proposed measures by Committee Member Wang Jingwei in response to Committee Member Soong Ching-ling's proposal, although they do not fully satisfy the people's desires, seem fair and just in discussing the matter. However, the key is to be able to implement things, and for the top and bottom to be of one mind and the whole country to be united. If the Central Committee has a plan to start anew with the people, but the party and government officials in the various provinces and cities do not conscientiously obey orders, how can they demonstrate the Central Committee's impartiality to the world? Today's difficulties are extreme. To save the country from danger, we must first revitalize ourselves. We should follow the lessons of Duke Xiao of Qin, who did not compromise in the face of adversity and adopted good advice, and the courage of Goujian of Yue, who avenged Wu. We should resolutely and thoroughly seek progress. Then, with sincere intentions, there will be a response from all quarters. I believe that at this time, the Central Committee should issue an order to all party, government, and military organs across the country, making its intentions clear, so that the enlightened will be encouraged and the uninformed will be relieved. In this way, a new, open approach can quickly achieve significant results. I respectfully submit this and hope for your consideration and acceptance." Li Liejun respectfully bows.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Report from Representatives of the China League for Civil Rights to Beijing <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The Provisional Central Executive Committee of the China League for Civil Rights held a meeting the day before yesterday to accept the report from the representatives previously sent to Beijing to rescue the Chen, Luo, and Yu case. It was also decided to formally write to Director Wang and Minister Luo, urging them to transfer Chen, Luo, Yu, and others to the courts for trial in order to emphasize civil rights. The main points of the report from the representatives to Beijing are as follows: Soong Ching-ling, Yang Xingfo, Wu Kaisheng, Shen Junru, and Inosheng arrived in Beijing on the 5th of this month and stayed at the Yangtze Hotel. Director Wang and Minister Luo visited Soong Ching-ling at the hotel that day. On the same day, Mrs. Sun, on behalf of the China League for Civil Rights, submitted a written request with four points: (1) immediately release all political prisoners; (2) abolish excessive punishment; (3) grant political prisoners the freedom to read newspapers and books, prohibit the use of shackles, and improve prison treatment; (4) severely punish prison officials who extort prisoners and engage in bribery. Regarding these principled requests, Director Wang promised to submit them to the Central Political Conference, which has been reported in various newspapers. The delegation also requested Minister Luo to immediately release Luo, Yu, Chen, and others who had been sent to Beijing the previous day. Minister Luo replied that he personally fully agreed with the principle of protecting civil rights. The Luo and Yu case had also been discussed with the Central Party Headquarters to transfer it to the court for handling. Later, after visiting Mr. and Mrs. Noulens, the representatives visited Luo Dengxian, Yu Wenhua, Chen Guang, and Chen Shuying at the Garrison Headquarters. There are currently about 200 political and legal prisoners imprisoned in the prison. The delegation also requested to see Huang Ping after meeting with Wang. Huang Ping was arrested in Tianjin in December of last year, which attracted international attention. He was later sent to Nanjing, where the Party Headquarters invited reporters and said that Huang Ping had already been released. Director Wang also said that Huang Ping was now living freely in a private residence and that Mrs. Sun could visit him. However, the next day, three guards, along with a secretary from the Party Headquarters, brought Huang Ping to see Mrs. Sun at the Yangtze Hotel. Huang's spirits were low and he looked very uneasy. When asked why, the representative from the Party Headquarters replied that Huang had tried to commit suicide by electrocution after being arrested in Tianjin, but failed. Huang himself said that the Party Headquarters had ordered him to choose one of two paths, and Huang had taken the second path (i.e., repentance). Mrs. Sun knew that Huang was under surveillance and had lost his freedom of speech, so she said goodbye and left.</p>

At 10 a.m. yesterday morning, a public demonstration was held at Longhua Airport. It was piloted by Major Du Lide, a world-renowned aviator from the United States who recently arrived in Shanghai. Those who attended included the newly appointed Governor of the Central Bank, Kong Xiangxi, Kong's secretary Xu Jianping, Director of the Consolidated Tobacco Tax Bureau Xie Qi, and dozens of Chinese and foreign journalists.

<p>The aircraft is a biplane single-seat military aircraft. The wings are painted yellow and the fuselage is dark gray. At 10:30 a.m., Major Du Lide began to prepare to board the aircraft. As soon as the engine started, the aircraft took off and first circled the field several times, then flew high into the clouds, performing all kinds of extremely dangerous maneuvers, such as flying upside down, sideways, spinning like a windmill, or skimming over the heads of the audience, all of which were extremely skillful. The audience was full of admiration. The performance lasted for half an hour before landing at the airport.</p>

<p>After Major Du Lide disembarked, Kong Xiangxi and others stepped forward to shake his hand. Then Du gave a detailed explanation of the aircraft's construction, saying that this aircraft is the latest product of the United States this year, and has all kinds of attack and defense equipment. The nose is equipped with a machine gun, and 12 heavy bombs can be placed under the wings. Its engine is a Wright rotary eagle type, with 650 horsepower, but can be increased to 700 horsepower. The cruising speed is 245 miles per hour, and it can fly as high as 35,000 feet. Kong and others were all satisfied and left happily.</p>

<p>Yesterday, this reporter interviewed Major Du Lide. According to him, this aircraft has two major advantages: flexible maneuverability, high speed and large size, and convenient landing. Each aircraft currently costs more than 80,000 US dollars, which is equivalent to more than 300,000 Chinese dollars. The highest altitude of today's performance was only 3,000 feet.</p>

<p>Suspect Transferred to Court</p>
<p>City Government Will Negotiate Again</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, regarding the case of the kidnapping of Korean national Li Chunshan on Luban Road, the city government, considering that the case occurred in the Chinese territory, ordered the Municipal Public Security Bureau to strictly arrest the kidnappers. After interrogation, the Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested a suspect named Diao Degao, who confessed that he was following the instructions of Japanese nationals Yamada and Kato to kidnap him. A few days after the incident, the local North-China Daily News reported that Li Chunshan had been escorted back to Korea by police from the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai. The city government considered the circumstances of this matter to be serious, so it sent a letter to the Japanese Consul General Ishii, requesting him to investigate and reply. Yesterday, the Japanese Consulate replied to the city government with content that was entirely evasive. Yesterday, the reporter visited Secretary-General Yu Hongjun of the city government and asked about the future negotiation policy. I was kindly informed in detail. The Japanese Consul General's reply and Secretary-General Yu's statement are recorded below.</p>
<p>Japanese Consul General's Reply: "To the Esteemed Mayor Wu: Regarding the case of the kidnapping of a Korean person Li Chunshan on March 9th of this year, I acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 1831 of April 8th, stating that the case has been investigated and found to have been committed by Japanese nationals Yamada and Kato, and requesting that these two individuals be arrested and brought to justice. The Consulate General has not been informed of this case, and the Japanese nationals mentioned in the letter have only surnames and no names. Therefore, it is difficult for this Consulate to investigate the facts. I hereby reply and request your review." Ishii Jotaro, Japanese Consul General in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Yu's Statement: According to Secretary-General Yu Hongjun of the city government, since the Li Chunshan kidnapping case occurred, the city government believes that since Li Chunshan has become a naturalized Korean, he should be protected by Chinese law, and the incident occurred in Chinese territory. Therefore, the Municipal Public Security Bureau was immediately ordered to strictly arrest the kidnappers. A suspect named Diao Degao was arrested, who confessed that he was kidnapped by Japanese nationals Yamada and others. Later, the local North-China Daily News reported that Li Chunshan had been escorted back to Korea by police from the Japanese Consulate. The city government immediately inquired with the Japanese Consulate, which replied that it was impossible to investigate because there were only surnames and no names, without denying the news reported in the North-China Daily News. In addition to ordering the Municipal Public Security Bureau to send the suspect Diao to the local court for legal proceedings, the city government also sent a letter to the local court, requesting that Diao be thoroughly interrogated to clarify the truth. At the same time, the Municipal Public Security Bureau was ordered to continue investigating the case and provide a concrete reply so that further negotiations could be conducted with the Japanese side.</p>

<p>According to the Continental Daily News, Indian Sikhs around the world are celebrating the birth of the Sikh Union, also known as the Sikh New Year, today (the 13th). The Sikh community in Shanghai began celebrating at midnight yesterday (the 12th) with a grand ceremony at the Indian Temple at 330 Baoshan Road, with many attendees. The celebration commemorates the heroic deeds of the five leaders and Xinji, the founder of Sikhism. A special event will be held at the temple again from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. today (the 13th), and people from other countries are invited to participate. There will be feasts and celebrations throughout the day. Today marks the anniversary of the Sikhs' liberation from Muslim oppression. It is said that in 1696 AD, the tenth Sikh leader Xinji convened a conference to commemorate his ancestors. 50,000 believers gathered, including Nanakji, who had dedicated his life to propagating opposition to Muslim oppression. He spoke to the crowd, asking them to sympathize with the suffering of their compatriots and work together to rescue them. Then the tenth Xinji asked the believers for five heads to wash away the filth of the Muslim king's tyranny with their blood. Five people immediately stepped forward, willing to sacrifice themselves for their compatriots. These five people did not lose their heads but became leaders of the Sikh community. The people were moved by the heroic deeds of these five people and united to achieve liberation.</p>

<p>Collision Situation: The Zhejiang Company's Deli vessel operates on the Shanghai-Haimen-Dinghai-Huangyan route. This time, it was returning to Shanghai from Huangyan. It departed from Dinghai on the morning of the 11th. Around 9 p.m., when it reached the waters of Yangshan, it saw the Haiguang vessel approaching rapidly. Its course was wrong and the distance was about one nautical mile. The Deli immediately sounded a warning. The Haiguang replied with one blast, but the vessel did not turn aside and continued straight ahead. The Deli then sounded another warning and turned its rudder to starboard to avoid danger. Unexpectedly, the distance was too short. As a result, the stern of the vessel, on the port side, and the second-class cabin were hit by the bow of the Haiguang vessel, creating a hole. An iron anchor from the port side of the Haiguang vessel was embedded in the iron plate, and the anchor chain was broken. Fortunately, it was above the waterline, so it was still possible to sail to Shanghai.</p>
<p>One Dead, One Injured: The vessel was carrying passengers and goods from Huangyan, Dinghai, and other places to Shanghai, with fresh eggs being the main cargo. There were more than 120 passengers in total. When the Haiguang collided with the vessel, a person from Taizhou named Luo Qihan, around 50 years old, was sleeping on the fresh eggs in the area where the hole was created. When the iron anchor broke through the iron plate and entered the vessel, it struck Luo's head, crushing it and causing the brain to spill out. The scene was too terrible to witness, and he died immediately. Another person nearby was hit in the head by iron debris and was slightly injured. After the vessel arrived in Shanghai, it reported the incident to the court for inspection. The body was temporarily placed in the Taizhou Guild Hall. A telegram was sent to Dinghai to inquire about Luo's family and notify them to come to Shanghai to claim the body. The matter of compensation will be discussed separately.</p>
<p>Yili Rescue: After the Deli was hit, it sounded a distress call. Fortunately, the Yili vessel of the Yili Company, which had departed from Dinghai as well, was behind it. After hearing the distress call, the Yili vessel quickly approached the Deli and completely rescued the passengers. The Deli then made some minor repairs and sailed to Shanghai.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Losses: The vessel has a deadweight of over 700 tons. This time, it was returning to Shanghai from Huangyan, carrying mainly fresh eggs. The collision with the Haiguang vessel damaged four iron plates and several rooms in the upper-deck cabin. The iron railings on the port side were broken, and 51 baskets of fresh eggs were damaged. The total loss is estimated at around 5,000 taels.</p>
<p>Inspection and Negotiation: Fortunately, the hole was above the waterline on the port side. The iron anchor of the Haiguang vessel is still embedded in the iron plate of the Deli. The rudder of the vessel was also slightly damaged. Afterwards, the shipowner made repairs and sailed to Shanghai, arriving at around 8 a.m. on the 12th. After unloading the cargo, it sailed to the waters off Longhua and anchored. The shipowner reported the collision to the company. The company had received news from the Yili vessel. After receiving the report from this vessel, it immediately reported to the relevant authorities and sent a letter to the Asiatic Petroleum Company to negotiate. It also sent a letter to the insurance company. Yesterday afternoon around 2 p.m., the Asiatic Petroleum Company sent a Westerner and an employee of the insurance company to the vessel along with representatives from the company to conduct an inspection. It is said that the responsibility for the incident lies with the Haiguang vessel. The Haiguang vessel was carrying kerosene to Ningbo and is expected to arrive in Shanghai today. After the Deli is inspected, it will be repaired at that location.</p>

<h3 id="e121">The City Council Disaster Area Reconstruction Group Met Yesterday <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Drafting Regulations and Urging the City Government to Actively Proceed</p>
<p>In order to promote the reconstruction of the disaster area as soon as possible, the Shanghai Provisional City Council had previously appointed councilors Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Chen Bingqian, Wang Yiting, Du Yuesheng, Li Fuxun, and Xu Yongzuo as members to be specifically in charge of this matter, and designated Xu Yongzuo to convene meetings, as reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday, the members met at the Bank Club. Except for Wang Xiaolai and Du Yuesheng, who were out of Shanghai due to other engagements, all members attended. It was decided to name the group the City Council Disaster Area Reconstruction Group, formulate the group's regulations, and unanimously decide to send a letter to the City Council to regularly invite representatives from the city government to attend meetings, explain the reconstruction plan and its implementation status, in order to emphasize municipal administration. The proposals and regulations of the group, as well as the original letter requesting the city government to send representatives to attend the meeting and explain the situation, are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Meeting Situation <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The Disaster Area Reconstruction Group of the Shanghai Provisional City Council held its first meeting at the Bank Club on Hong Kong Road at noon on April 13th. Councilors Yu Qiaqing, Chen Bingqian, Wang Yiting, Li Fuxun, and Xu Yongzuo attended. Wang Xiaolai and Du Yuesheng were absent.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Resolutions <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The following matters were discussed: (1) The Name of the Group. Xu Yongzuo reported that the City Council had previously appointed the seven of them to be specifically responsible for reviewing and supervising the reconstruction of the city's disaster area, and had named it the Shanghai City Reconstruction Disaster Area Design Committee. The group should discuss and decide whether the name is appropriate. He also designated himself as the convener of the meeting. He believed that the name of the above committee was likely to cause two misunderstandings: (1) it has the suspicion of interfering with administration, and (2) it seems to be an independent and external organization, which is not in line with the powers of the City Council and the internal organization. Therefore, it is proposed to refer to the regulations of the City Council's organizational rules for grouping the Fourth Article, named the Disaster Area Reconstruction Group, its name implies that it is purely an internal review agency of the City Council, shall not exercise powers to the outside, so the name can be corrected to avoid misunderstandings, can you ask for a resolution? After public discussion, it was unanimously approved. (2) The Group's Regulations. Xu Yongzuo drafted the group's regulations and distributed them to the councilors for circulation. After public discussion, the original draft was passed without modification, and it was resolved to submit it to the City Council for discussion and implementation. (3) Implementation Methods. Xu Yongzuo proposed that the original intention of the City Council in establishing this group was to promote the early completion of the reconstruction of the disaster area. In order to follow this purpose, the group must first understand the city government's reconstruction plan and its implementation procedures, otherwise it would be impossible to proceed. It has been four months since the issuance of the 6 million yuan reconstruction bonds, but the disaster area still shows broken tiles and ruined walls, and the desolation is full of eyes, the citizens' expectations for reconstruction are no less than the hope of clouds and rainbows in a great drought, the city government has really proceeded to what extent, it is very suspenseful, it is proposed that this group write to the City Council to convene a regular meeting, and ask the city government to send representatives to attend and explain in detail, now draw up a letter to the City Council, if everyone agrees, then please sign and seal it, after the public read the letter, they unanimously agreed, and signed and sealed it on the spot and sent it to the City Council, the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<h3 id="e125">City Chamber of Commerce Letter to Fish Trade Groups Urging Strict Enforcement of Regulations and Ceasing Sale of Japanese Fish <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Unscrupulous Merchants Repeatedly Sell Japanese Fish Due to Greed</p>
<p>Trade Associations Should Restrain Members from Covertly Violating Regulations</p>
<p>Yesterday, the City Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to both the Ice-Chilled Fish Trade Association and the Salted Fish Trade Association, urging them to restrain their members from importing Japanese fish. The original letter stated: "We have received a letter from the Fish Trade Inspection Committee for Enemy Goods stating that despite our repeated resistance against Japanese oppression and our attempts to boycott goods, we have ultimately failed. The reasons for this failure are twofold: (1) The officials are not diligent and engage in favoritism and corruption. (2) The inspectors lack the experience to distinguish enemy goods. In the past, the merchant organization had an Economic Relations with Japan Committee, which believed that each trade had personnel capable of identifying enemy goods, making it easier to eliminate them. However, this initiative was hampered by two factors: first, accusations from the outside that merchants were protecting each other, and second, committee members of trade associations being irresponsible and prioritizing personal relationships. Since the September 18th Incident, our fish trade has largely relied on Russian merchants for imported fish, such as salmon. However, recently, a small number of unscrupulous merchants have openly transported Japanese Busan Daechongcheon Donggukou dried oiled fresh fish without any scruples. Daechongcheon goods are similar to those from Vladivostok, and oiled fresh fish are similar to American small fresh fish. Although outsiders cannot distinguish these goods, many within the fish trade also cannot identify them. In light of this, we have urgently established this association to identify the source of enemy goods, down to a single box. For example, the recent shipment of 932 boxes of Daechongcheon goods, which unscrupulous merchants intended to sell, was diverted to Qingdao due to our association's surveillance. Selling this cargo in Shanghai would have yielded several thousand yuan in profit, while exporting it would have resulted in a loss of one thousand yuan. In the future, our association will not only prevent the sale of enemy goods but also secretly inform anti-Japanese associations in various locations to detain and severely punish offenders. As for the issue of Japanese vessels intruding on our fishing grounds, we must resist them even more strongly. These fresh fish are managed by companies such as the Kyodo Kabushiki Gaisha Nikko Yoko, which specifically entrusts the distribution to fishmongers in Xiaodongmen. However, most fishmongers in Xiaodongmen have refused to sell them due to significant debts owed to boat owners, with only Qiafeng Gongshun and a few other shops agreeing to sell them. After our association was established, we sent a warning letter to the Ice-Chilled Fish Association. However, Qiafeng Fish Shop and Shenfeng Yongmao Fruit Shop have continued to sell them without any hesitation. Yesterday, our association received a report that the Daicheng Maru had arrived with 1,200 boxes of small yellow croaker. At 3:00 AM, our executives, Jin Chuxiang and Huang Zenshi, led the entire staff to the location and seized the cargo. Qiafeng Shop and Shenfeng Yongmao Fruit Shop were selling the fish. In addition to urging them to stop selling, we also lectured the peddlers on the dangers of Japanese fishing encroachment. The audience was outraged and poured kerosene on the fish, which slightly deterred the unscrupulous merchants. Today, all enemy fish sales have been suspended. However, we fear that unscrupulous merchants, driven by greed, may attempt to sell them covertly again. Our association plans to take further action. We pledge, with an honest and impartial conscience, to sacrifice everything to eliminate enemy fish. Our association is organized through the cooperation of workers and managers, who supervise each other to achieve fairness and integrity. We are eager to report our work progress at any time and hope that your association will instruct all trades in this city to conduct the same movement to facilitate the boycott of goods. We would be deeply grateful for your guidance." The letter emphasizes that ceasing the sale of Japanese fish is essential for economic severance with Japan. Since the provisional members' meeting of this association on September 20th, we have repeatedly emphasized this matter. Based on the previous situation, it is evident that the association's regulations have not been strictly enforced, leading to increasingly lax prohibitions, which is regrettable. To learn from past mistakes, your association should make every effort to revitalize itself, restrain its members, and prevent them from superficially complying while covertly violating regulations, as this would damage the association's credibility. This is of utmost importance.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Letter to the Council <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The letter to the Municipal Council requesting the Municipal Government to send personnel to explain the restoration situation states: "In order to restore the disaster area, the Municipal Government of this city issued a disaster area restoration public bond of 6 million yuan in December of last year. It has been four months since then, and the bond proceeds have long been fully collected. However, the disaster area still remains a scene of broken tiles and dilapidated walls, and the citizens of the disaster area are hoping for restoration as much as they are hoping for rain in a severe drought. The Municipal Government must have already drafted a plan for the restoration, and the implementation of the plan must also be actively proceeding. We do not know to what extent it has been handled. Our councilors are very concerned about this. The issuance of public bonds for the restoration of disaster areas is a particularly important matter. According to the provisions of Article 5, Paragraph 3 and Paragraph 5 of the organizational regulations of this association, this restoration plan and implementation procedures should be discussed by this association. For this reason, we jointly send this letter, proposing that a meeting be convened on a regular basis, and requesting the Municipal Government to send personnel to attend the meeting and provide a detailed explanation, in order to emphasize municipal administration. We respectfully hope that you will investigate and handle this matter. This is most important. The councilors of the Shanghai Provisional Municipal Council are Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Chen Bingqian, Wang Yiting, Du Yuesheng, Li Fusun, and Xu Yongxiang."</p>

<h3 id="e128">Wang Fushen's Private Wireless Telephone Invention Amid National Crisis <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Results of Trials at the Central Research Institute in the Capital</p>
<p>Extremely Suitable for Military Orders and Superior to Encrypted Telegrams</p>
<p>The Institute of Physics Sends Personnel to Shanghai for Further Trials</p>
<p>Wang Fushen, a student at the National Tongji University in Wusong, has recently invented a type of private wireless telephone. After discussions with the Minister of Education, Zhu Jiahua, and the Director of the Telegraph Administration, Yan Renguang, and trials at the Central Research Institute, the invention is considered extremely suitable for all military command and order purposes in the current national crisis, and even superior to the currently used military cipher telegrams in terms of secrecy. A reporter from the Huadong News Agency specifically drove to the university yesterday to interview Wang regarding the invention's development. The following is a record of what he was told:</p>
<h3 id="e129">Motivation for Invention <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>According to Wang, "Several years ago, I noticed that military telegrams, even with encryption, were sometimes easily deciphered, and the risk was even greater if the codebook was lost. At that time, the idea of researching wireless telephone arose in my mind. However, it was very complicated at first, and due to economic reasons, I was unable to conduct sufficient research, so the matter was temporarily shelved."</p>
<h3 id="e130">After the January 28th Incident <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>"When the January 28th Shanghai Incident occurred last year, our school was devastated by the Japanese army. Overcome with pain and anger, the idea of the secret wireless telephone in my mind suddenly reappeared, so I actively researched it. By October, I realized that the machine's structure was extremely simple. At that time, I discussed the idea with my classmate, Li Jisun, who believed that it was worth trying. So, I implored the school authorities to provide financial assistance, and as a result, I was granted permission by Principal Weng Zilong and Secretary-General Zhou Shang to conduct the experiment."</p>
<h3 id="e131">Successful Trial <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>"Subsequently, the Institute of Physics of the Central Research Institute discussed it and Mr. Cai Jintao came to the school in person to re-test it, believing that the theory and facts were consistent, with only a small part remaining to be improved. This small part is very easy to improve and will be modified in the near future to make it perfect."</p>
<h3 id="e132">Audience with Zhu in the Capital <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>"After the successful trial, I went to Beijing to meet with the Minister of Education, Zhu Jiahua, through the introduction of Principal Weng Zilong. I was granted an audience, and I presented the origin and development of the private wireless telephone to Mr. Zhu. Afterwards, I was introduced by Minister Zhu to Yan Renguang, the Director of the Telegraph Administration of the Ministry of Communications. When I met Mr. Yan, in addition to explaining the principles and asking for his corrections (because Mr. Yan is a radio expert), I also asked whether it could be offered for military use. Mr. Yan listened and replied that it could, so he ordered me to go to the National Defense Design Committee to meet with Zhu Qiqing, a full-time committee member. At the same time, he also invited another specialist, Jin Xianzao, to meet with me. After a long discussion, both Mr. Jin and Mr. Zhu hoped that I would quickly submit a formal request for military authorities to adopt it."</p>
<h3 id="e133">Better Than Encrypted Telegrams <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Wang continued, "The messages transmitted by ordinary radios can be received by anyone with a radio. The secret wireless telephone that I invented has special devices for both transmission and reception and cannot be received by ordinary radios. Its structure is very simple, making it suitable for all military command and order purposes. The military telegrams currently sent, even with encryption, are often easily deciphered, and the risk is even greater if the codebook is lost. I cannot disclose the detailed principles, structure, and usage because they are military secrets."</p>

<p>Yesterday was the fourth day of the Railway Goods Exhibition. Although the spring weather was still cold, the number of visitors was still very high, especially the number of foreign guests. Central Committee Member Yang Xingfo, former Vice Minister of the Ministry of Railways Wang Zheng, and Dr. Mole, the German Consul-General, all visited the exhibition. Mr. Yang praised the exhibits for being neat, beautiful, and well-arranged. He also said that the charts were well-made and detailed, and that the railway's main products were agricultural products, minerals, and daily necessities. He hoped that visitors would not be indifferent because of the ordinary nature of the daily necessities. Mr. Wang Wenbo also visited the agricultural products room and marveled at the various types of melon seeds on display, saying that he had never seen anything like it before.</p>

<h3 id="e143">San You Society's Appeal Rejected <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Dismissal of Workers Without Approval from the Social Affairs Bureau</p>
<p>Workers Residing in the Factory Cannot Be Considered Occupying</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th: The Supreme Court has rejected the appeal of the Shanghai San You Society in a case seeking confirmation of the termination of the employment contract, the return of the factory building and equipment. The appellant shall bear the cost of the third instance litigation. The reason is that the company dismissed the workers without the approval of the Social Affairs Bureau, so the employment contract has not been legally terminated. Moreover, according to Article 27 of the Factory Law, the factory must give prior notice to the workers if it wants to terminate the contract. Even if it publishes an advertisement, it cannot be considered a statement of termination of the employment contract. Before the employment contract is terminated, the factory workers' residence in the factory cannot be considered an occupation of the factory property and equipment. The original judgment is correct in all respects.</p>

<h3 id="e145">Investigation of Factory Boiler Explosions <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>According to the records of the Municipal Council, there have been 11 factory boiler explosions in the past six years, killing 89 people and injuring 72. The most serious incident was the Zhengtaili Factory incident. In total, there were two rubber refining furnace explosions, five boiler explosions, one acetylene gas tank explosion, one glycerine evaporator explosion, one power transformer explosion, and one metal melting vessel explosion. In March 1931, a boiler at a cigarette factory on Jingzhou Road exploded, and the outer shell, which was 6 1/2 feet long and 40 inches in diameter, weighing about one ton, flew 200 yards. According to the post-accident investigation, the safety valve on the boiler was not damaged. The explosion was probably due to a lack of water in the boiler, which was caused by poorly trained managers. In 1930, a worker at a sock factory on Binlang Road was scalded to death by boiling water from the furnace while adding coal to the furnace. According to the investigation report, it was because the furnace door was not secure, causing water vapor to escape. According to the practice of Western countries, all boilers must be registered and numbered, and inspected annually by experienced engineers, who issue certificates specifying the pressure that the furnace can withstand. Afterwards, inspectors should check the certificate and the pressure gauge on the furnace when they come to the factory. Also, at regular intervals, the boiler must be completely removed for thorough inspection. In Shanghai factories, acetylene and oxygen blowpipes are often used for forging. Acetylene can explode even when it does not come into contact with air, so special attention should be paid to its transport equipment. In rubber refining furnaces, steam and air under pressure are injected, so special attention should be paid to safety measures such as safety valves.</p>

<p>—Causing Opposition from Merchants and Residents of the Entire Town—</p>
<p>Wang Dechang, Fei Yongyi (A San), a person from Jiangbei, and Tang Fusheng, a local person, have been setting up fruit stalls on the Huajie Bridge at Xujiahui Town in Zhabei (west of the French Police Station). They have obtained licenses from the Health Bureau for food stalls and the Finance Bureau for stall base fees. However, at around 4:00 PM yesterday, a large French police truck carrying more than ten Chinese and Vietnamese police officers suddenly arrived and forcibly loaded Wang and others' fruit, food, and stall frames onto the car and drove away quickly. Fortunately, Wang Dechang and others escaped and were not arrested. The Sixth District, Second Branch, Third Post of the Municipal Public Security Bureau was originally located there, but it was unable to stop them, so it returned to the station to report. After receiving the report, Chief Wu Zhengding went to investigate, but the police officers had already left, so he had to report to Bureau Chief Wen Hongen by telephone for instructions. It is now known that all the merchants and residents of the town believe that the police's overstepping of boundaries and interference with the street vendors has harmed national sovereignty. They have asked the Chamber of Commerce for assistance and jointly petitioned the Municipal Government to protest to the French consulate as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The Chinese and Western detectives of the Yangshupu Police Station previously arrested bandits Lei Chun from Jiangbei, Wang Desheng, Chen Weilou, female thief Liu Wangshi, Xu Pengshi, and suspect Wang Tingjian and others. After investigation, it was found that from September of last year to January of this year, they successively robbed houses with weapons, including the house of Na Mao囡 at No. 42 Yaojiaqiao, Cangpeng Road; Zhou Tongjian at No. 71 Ningwu Road; Guo Kaining at No. 574 Heineng Road; Pingwei Zhu at a nameless house on Zishan Road; Mu Sheng at No. 10 Xiamen Road; and She Hangyuan at No. 19 Methexsi Road, stealing clothing and silver worth more than two thousand four hundred yuan, letters, and posted at No. 436 Chaoyang Road, Yangshupu, to Zhang Huanzhong, a resident, demanding a ransom of ten thousand yuan and fired two shots as a warning.

<h3 id="e151">Hat Thief <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>—Sentenced to Imprisonment for One Year and Five Months—</p>
<p>Zhang Desheng, a native of Ningbo, 19 years old, previously served in the military in Nanjing. After retiring, he came to Shanghai last autumn and stayed at a friend's place at No. 91 Xizang Road. Unable to find a job, he often went to the Rongguang Cinema at No. 19 Haining Road to watch movies for entertainment. Later, his purse was empty. Seeing that the felt hats worn by the audience were valuable, he took the opportunity to steal them. From December 22 of last year to the 4th of this year, he stole a total of eight hats, which he pawned in the Wusong Road area, obtaining tens of yuan to spend daily. The day before yesterday afternoon, he went to the cinema again to engage in this activity and was discovered by Zhao Amao and Gu Genxin. They saw him entering in a hurry and leaving with a felt hat in his hand after a while. They immediately questioned him, but he spoke evasively. It was then discovered that the hat belonged to a spectator surnamed Tan. They then handed him over to Chinese detective Wang Guangqi, who took him to the Hongkou Police Station and recovered the original eight stolen felt hats from various pawnshops. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special District Court. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the cause of the case, saying that the felt hats of the cinema's audience were often disappearing without a trace, so the matter was reported to the management, who instructed the inspectors to pay attention, and the defendant was apprehended. However, the owners of the lost hats could not be found and summoned. Although the cinema had posted advertisements on the glass before the shows to claim the hats, only one owner had come forward. The defendant admitted to the crime in the police station without hesitation. He was asked to be severely punished. The stolen hats were presented for inspection. When questioned, the defendant confessed that he was unemployed and had no other options, so he resorted to this tactic, asking for leniency. Judge Wu Zehan sentenced Zhang Desheng to one year and five months of imprisonment as a warning for habitual theft. The stolen goods will be temporarily stored at the police station for collection.</p>

<p>Bandits' Vicious Plot Takes a Life</p>
<p>Heavy Sentences for Each After Trial</p>
<p>Bandits Yue Jicai, Liu Yu'an (nicknamed "Tianjin Old Liu"), Lu Fugen (known as "Little Barbarian"), etc., had previously repeatedly sneaked into the Wang Shunxing Lumber Yard on Hed Road to steal lumber, but were always discovered by the yard's watchman, Wang Amei, resulting in failure. They hated him to the bone. Agreeing that they should eliminate Wang if they wanted to steal items from the yard, the group set out from a certain place after 9 PM on January 7 of this year, each carrying an ax and a bag of lime. They went straight to Wang Maoshun's lumber yard. When they arrived, they swarmed forward, first throwing the bag of lime to blind Wang Amei, then using axes to chop him wildly, killing him instantly, before fleeing in a burst of noise. Later, the Xinzha Police Station successively arrested the murderers and recovered two axes and a bag of lime. After the investigation confirmed the facts, the Public Works Department lawyer Wang Yaotang filed a lawsuit based on the charge of premeditated murder. Judge Qian Wenji of the First Special District Court completed the investigation. Yesterday morning, the court session was held and it was announced that Liu Yu'an was sentenced to life imprisonment for the crime of premeditated murder, Yue Jicai was sentenced to twenty years of imprisonment for the crime of premeditated murder, and Lu Fugen was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment for the crime of joint murder. The axes and other murder weapons were confiscated.</p>

<p>Both the Jiangsu Second Prison Branch Prison and the Shanghai First Special District Court Guardhouse believe that the current number of guards is insufficient, and more need to be added to strengthen prison affairs. Furthermore, the position of guard is the first step for prison personnel, and the Ministry of Judicial Administration has previously issued a notice stipulating that the chief guard should be promoted from senior guards. Therefore, it is necessary to cultivate the knowledge of the guards to a considerable extent. Sun Xiong, the director of the branch prison and the director of the guardhouse, has now been approved by the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court to establish a male and female guard training institute. In addition to the current male and female guards being allowed to enter the institute for training, a notice was issued on the 1st of this month to recruit ten male students and thirty female students. The age of the applicants should be between 25 and 40 years old, and they must have graduated from a junior elementary school or higher. The original deadline for registration was set for the 10th of this month, and the examination was scheduled to begin on the 16th. Now, Director Sun feels that the previously set timeframe is too short and is deeply concerned that students from other areas will not be able to arrive on time, so the registration deadline for female students has been extended to the 25th of this month, and the examination date for both male and female students has been changed to the 30th of this month. If the examination results are satisfactory and the applicant is admitted, they will enter the training institute to receive training under the guidance of the director. Classes will be held from 7 PM to 9 PM every afternoon, except for Sundays and designated holidays, and the training will last for three months. If the examination is passed, a diploma will be awarded. If selected to be a guard, the monthly salary will be from fourteen to twenty yuan. Those who are not selected will be listed as substitutes for future vacancies. Anyone who has received a lower-level education and is currently unemployed can quickly bring a photo and resume to register.</p>

The family lives at No. 2 Dafeng Lane, Huanlong Road, French Concession. On the morning of December 28 last year, Wang was playing nearby when he was suddenly kidnapped.

<p>Wang did not have such a large sum and did not contact them. Three months have passed, and Wang is still missing. Until 4:45 PM the day before yesterday, a group of Chinese detectives from the Xinzha Police Station, led by Ruan Yao, were passing near Aiwenyi Road, Changsha Road, when they suddenly saw two people coming towards them, whose behavior was suspicious. Upon closer inspection, they were indeed kidnapping bandits who were involved in the kidnapping of a five-year-old child at No. 74 Kaifeng Road in 1930. They reported to Chinese three-way leader No. 1422, and Chinese officers No. 1048 and No. 130, who stepped forward and arrested the two bandits. They were taken to the Xinzha Police Station. After investigation by the Chinese and Western detectives, it was learned that the bandits' names were Wang Yuanwei (also known as Wang Laotu) and Qian Ziming, both from Shaoxing, and they confessed to committing the above two kidnapping cases and confessed to</p>

As soon as they saw the detectives, they fled out the back door, but they were still arrested, and hostage Wang Delin was recovered. Wang's hair had grown an inch long, and he had a fair face. He was wearing slippers. He had been in the bandits' den for a hundred days. The bandits did not bother to cut his hair and wore them</p>

<p>Wang Yuanwei also confessed to the kidnapping cases of the five-year-old child at No. 74 Kaifeng Road and Wang Delin. Qian Ziming also confessed to the police station that he had kidnapped a child named Lin, eleven years old, in Shaoxing, and sent a letter to his father, Lin Songchun, demanding a large sum of money and arranging to meet at Room 44 of the Aiwen Hotel on Aiwenyi Road in Shanghai. Lin sent Chen Bingqing as a representative to Shanghai, and the ammunition for this case was supplied by the defendant Chen Guoqian. Therefore, in addition to arresting Chen, the police also went to the Aiwen Hotel to investigate the registration book of Room 44, and it was indeed registered under Chen's name, so the case</p>

After Judge Qian Wenji verified the confession, he ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody separately and adjourned the hearing for seven days to investigate and verify further.

<p>Doing All Sorts of Evil in Jingmen, Including Murder and Arson</p>

<p>Yang Chunrong, also known as Yi Ronghua, the leader of the bandits in Jingmen County, Hubei Province, commanded thousands of bandits, with a formidable force, kidnapping for ransom, robbing homes, committing murder and arson, and doing all sorts of evil. The elite of the area were completely trampled, and the people hated him to the bone. Recently, the public telegraphed the military authorities, requesting them to send troops to suppress the bandits. Only then was Yang's power completely eradicated. Yang had no place to stand, so he fled to Shanghai alone. The Jingmen County Government sent a document to the Hubei Security Office, which forwarded a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Government, requesting them to pay attention to the search and arrest. On the other hand, Xiao Gongfu, the president of the Chamber of Commerce, instructed Liu Jianfu to come to Shanghai to investigate Yang's whereabouts. On the 28th of last month, Liu found that Yang was living in Room 278 of the Shanghai New Hotel at No. 331 Hubei Road in the Public Concession. He reported to the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Director Wen instructed the detectives, led by Gao Wansheng and Liu Shaoqing, to go to the address with Zhao Ziren, a Chinese detective from the Old Gate Police Station. They arrested Yang and sent him to the First Special District Court. Because it was necessary to inquire with the Hubei Provincial Security Office and the Jingmen Local Court, the court ordered an adjournment. Yesterday morning, Feng Shide, the head of the Criminal Court of the First Special Court, reopened the hearing. The court first handed over the reply telegram from the Security Office to the police lawyer Ru Baoyi for review and stated that the Jingmen County Local Court had not yet sent an official document to the court, so the case still needed to be postponed. Gao Wansheng of the Public Security Bureau declared, "The document from the Hubei Provincial Security Office only stated that Yang Chunrong had committed crimes such as kidnapping, murder, and arson and requested that he be handed over to the Public Security Bureau for transfer. However, the wording was vague, without specifying who made the accusation, what kind of case was committed, and it did not conform to the agreement with this court. The Municipal Public Security Bureau should telegraph to inquire about the details of the case and the names of the victims. After receiving a reply telegram, we will verify the information." On one hand, this court will re-telegraph the Jingmen Local Court to investigate. The court ordered the case to be adjourned for verification.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Important Communist Party Offender Arrested <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Including He Long's Mistress</p>
<p>The Case Is Not Yet Fully Understood</p>
<p>A certain Ye, an important member of the Propaganda Department of the Communist Party Central Committee (it remains to be confirmed whether the name is Gongchao), was arrested in Hangzhou last month by the Zhejiang Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau and sent to the Central Administration in Nanjing for trial. According to his confession, He Long's wife, He Xiangshi, also known as Wang Xiangshi, is currently hiding at a certain number in Meishan Lane, Jiaxini Road, in the French Concession, and is responsible for the secret work of the Communist Party Red Army, and is managing the disbursement of party funds, etc. The Administration immediately telegraphed the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau to arrest her. After receiving the telegram, the Municipal Public Security Bureau prepared a document a few days ago and sent personnel to the French Police to request assistance in arresting and bringing her to justice for interrogation. The French Police Department's political director reported to the Second Special District Court, which issued a search warrant and dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to go to the address and arrest the woman, He Xiangshi, also known as Wang Xiangshi (named Xiang Yuangu, 32 years old, from Shashi, Hunan), and three men, Wang Mingwen and Wang Ruiqing, etc., and two children. Two gold seals with her name and style were found, as well as letters, clothes, and other items, and taken to the police station. Detectives were dispatched to guard the premises. The next day, two people from Hunan, Xiong Youwu and Xiong Kanwen, went to find a friend surnamed Zhang, and another man, A, were arrested and sent to the police station. The defendants were sent to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court the day before yesterday. Chief Judge Zhou, together with Judges Guo and Fan and the prosecutor, opened the court for interrogation. Because the case was political, onlookers were prohibited. It was reported that the Municipal Public Security Bureau sent Ye to court to provide testimony and requested permission to transfer the defendants, but the police department opposed the transfer because the evidence provided by the An Bureau was not sufficient and requested an adjournment for further investigation. According to Wang Xiangshi's confession, her surname is Wang, not He, and she came to Shanghai to escape from banditry in her hometown. She denied any connection with the Communist Party Red Army. Wang, Xiong, and others all claimed to be merchants in Shanghai and knew nothing about the Communist Party. The defendants all retained lawyer Shi Liang for their defense. It was reported that the court ordered a two-week adjournment to investigate further, and the defendants were remanded in custody pending further instructions. According to investigations, Xiangshi and He Long were not married, but they had a prior affair. He Long gave her money to break off the relationship, and she came to Shanghai in 1928.</p>

<p>—Splits Open Corpse Coffin; Chops Off Corpse Head; Strips Corpse Clothes—</p>
<p>Li Jinfang, a native of Lishui residing at an unmarked address in the east town of Fahua, Huxi, works as a coppersmith at a machine factory. His wife, Dou Shi, 34 years old, has suffered from mental illness. She has episodes and recovers. Yesterday morning, Dou Shi suddenly went to the cemetery behind Columbia Road and used an ax to split open the coffins of corpses, large and small. Inside one, there was a corpse of a person about 40 years old that had already decomposed. She also chopped off the head of an undecomposed boy about five or six years old and threw it beside the coffin. She stripped the clothes off the body of a very plump boy under one year old and washed them by the pond. A Western servant of a foreign family in the area saw this and immediately reported it to Police Chief Jiang Hongye of the Fahua Police Station in the Second Subdivision of the Sixth District. Upon receiving the report, he went to investigate and immediately arrested the madwoman, Li Dou Shi, along with the three pieces of clothing from the corpse of the child, and took them all to the station. Director Wu briefly questioned her, but she did not answer the questions asked. He then prepared a document and sent it to the bureau for interrogation. The four large and small coffins that were pried open had no families to be found. The local baojia Wang Yuezhai has been ordered to hire workers to bury the bodies to promote sanitation.</p>

<p>The representatives of the Shanghai Chinese Women's Relief Association for Northeastern Compatriots, Shen Huilian, Wang Xiaoying, and Wei Qiongying, arrived in Peiping and visited the Xifengkou to comfort the troops, as reported in a previous issue. It has now been learned that they will return south within days. The following is a brief account of their daily activities in Peiping. Consoling Wounded Soldiers and Refugees Because the relief supplies transported by the Railway Bureau had not yet arrived in Peiping, they purchased clothes, shoes, and socks in Peiping and distributed them to various troops. They visited wounded soldiers and refugees in Zunhua and Kangzhuang for days and distributed clothes and supplies. The wounded officers at the Xiehe Hospital were greatly comforted by the representatives, who brought flowers and fruit, and expressed their deep gratitude. Even in their moans, they still talked to the representatives about their desire to return to the front lines to continue resisting Japan after they recovered. According to Chief Wang of the 41st Army, the wounded soldiers of his army were stationed in Zhangyuan and Kangzhuang, with more in Kangzhuang, and they were in dire need of clothing. Because of the tight schedule, the representatives were unable to go to the front lines further away to comfort the troops, so they also visited the offices of various armies stationed in Peiping and inquired in detail about the combat situation at the front.</p>

<h3 id="e167">The French Concession Stall Fee Dispute Was Resolved Yesterday <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Fixed Size Still Pays Two Yuan</p>
<p>All Vendors Resume Business Today</p>
<p>The French Municipal Council's increase in stall fees caused a storm, and the vendors reported this to the French Concession Stallholders' Association, requesting assistance. The association sent a letter to the French Municipal Council, appealing twice. It is learned that the association sent a special envoy, Hu Zhishan, to the French Municipal Council the day before yesterday (the 12th) to appeal in person. The Director-General of the Municipal Council, Fules, met with him. Hu explained in detail the various hardships and overwhelming difficulties of the vendors. Director-General Fu was also sympathetic to the vendors and specifically stipulated that the size of the stalls should be one meter and two centimeters long (four feet) and nine centimeters wide (three feet), and the license fee should still be two yuan. However, if this limit is exceeded, a five-yuan license is required. Hu was satisfied and returned to the association to report. The vendors were informed of this news and were grateful for the Director-General's sympathy for the common people and his protection of the vendors. They were also grateful for the efforts of Hu Zhifen in running around and appealing effectively. The vendors decided to resume business across the board starting today. Therefore, the increase in fees was resolved. ○ ○ ○ ○</p>
<p>The Japanese People's Repatriation Group was addressed by Shen Huilian and Wei Qiongying. Ms. Shen repeatedly enlightened the school-age children about the idea of avenging national hatred. For the homeless women, she suggested engaging in rear-area work. Finally, she donated 1,000 silver dollars to the group.</p>
<p>A Joint Gathering of Women's Associations from the North and South The representatives were deeply grateful for the warm hospitality they received during their visit to Peiping. A few days ago, Chief Commander Song Zheyuan hosted a banquet for the representatives at Zhongxin Hall. Minister He also went to the Central Hotel to encourage the representatives and talked about the government's determination to resist Japan. In addition, the Peiping Women's Relief and Comfort Association, the YWCA, and the National Salvation Ten-Person Group jointly hosted a banquet for the representatives at the American and European Students Association. Dozens of people attended. Women from the North and South gathered together and, in addition to encouraging each other, discussed the work of women in the rear. Everyone felt that the national crisis was imminent and that women across the country should stand on the same battle line and work hard to save the country.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Public Health Bureau Strictly Prevents Impostors: A Notice to Inform Citizens <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Health Bureau hereby issues the following notice:</p>
<p>Regarding the registration and licensing of various professions related to public health, which are handled by this Bureau, all procedures are established according to regulations, and the fees to be collected are clearly specified. All revenue is deposited into the city treasury and official receipts stamped by the Finance Bureau are used as proof. All applications for registration and licensing are processed if they do not violate regulations, and are never deliberately obstructed. Even if there are shortcomings, guidance for improvement will be provided for re-processing. Any compulsory actions are always carried out by requesting the Public Security Bureau to order the relevant district offices to cooperate in enforcement, acting impartially according to regulations. Bribes are strictly forbidden and intercession is not permitted. This is the unwavering principle of this Bureau. However, it has come to our attention that some unscrupulous individuals are impersonating Bureau personnel, swindling and deceiving, attempting to defraud, or extorting money to satisfy their own desires, or soliciting license applications for personal gain. We have heard of such incidents repeatedly, and have been investigating and apprehending the perpetrators without success. Recently, one person was apprehended in the Zhabei area. In addition to detaining and severely punishing this individual, we will continue to investigate and apprehend others at any time. Fearing that citizens may be easily deceived by these illegal activities, we hereby issue this notice, urging you to pay attention to the following points:</p>
<p>1.  Anyone who needs to apply for a license from this Bureau should come to the Bureau in person or apply in writing. If you encounter someone soliciting services on your behalf, you should refuse immediately to prevent them from profiting at your expense, causing you losses, and harming the Bureau's reputation.</p>
<p>2.  Illegal fees are unlawful gains. This Bureau strictly prohibits all staff from using their position to demand anything, such as monthly allowances, holiday gifts, transportation money, or money for wine, shoes, and socks. All improper gains are prohibited. Do not attempt to offer such things, as it will harm both yourself and others.</p>
<p>3.  If you believe there is an event that endangers public health, you can report it to the Bureau in writing for investigation and handling. If it is impossible to verify the facts after the event, you can report it to the nearest police post.</p>
<p>4.  When encountering someone claiming to be conducting an official inquiry, you may ask to see their employee identification card (which must have their photo attached, indicating their title, name, and bearing the official seal). Health inspectors must wear uniforms and badges (stating their name and bearing the Bureau seal). You can also ask to see these to prevent impersonation.</p>
<p>We urge you to pay close attention to the above points. This is of utmost importance. This notice is hereby issued for public information.</p>

<h3 id="e169">Female Swindlers Rampant at Sea <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Seven Families Scammed</p>
<p>Residents Should Be Extra Vigilant</p>
<p>Recently, four or five flamboyant women, dressed in black sheepskin coats and yellow overcoats, around thirty years old, speaking with a Hangzhou accent, have been loitering on the Bund, making a living by scamming people. A few days ago, students from the Nanyang Model High School in Xujiahui, Yang Shuguo, Xie Shixiao, Jin Yongguang, Wu Huaqing, Yao Yongyao, Zhu Zemin, and Jiang Baoshan, were at home during their spring break when these unemployed women visited, claiming to be the older sisters or relatives of certain students. They said they were passing through Shanghai and were short of travel expenses, so they had no choice but to ask for loans. The students, feeling strongly about their classmates, readily offered assistance. However, yesterday, when the school reopened and the students returned to class, they inquired about the truth from the classmates in question, who said that there was no such thing. This caused them to be shocked. As a result, seven people were scammed out of over one hundred dollars. Detectives have been dispatched to conduct a thorough investigation and apprehension. The addresses of those who were scammed are listed below: Yang Shuguo, residing at Hejiajiao, South of Fahua; Jin Yongguang, residing at West Qiaojia Road, inside the Dananmen; Wu Huaqing, residing on Ningbo Road; Yao Yongyao, residing on Seward Road; Zhu Zemin, residing on Shanhai Pass Road; Jiang Baoshan, residing at the end of Connaught Road, Singapore Road. The female swindlers worked in teams, swindling the above seven families. Their audacity is remarkable. According to student Yang Shuguo, classmates Ye Fuzeng, Xue Jinshou, Qiu Kunde, and Xie Dexian were also nearly swindled out of money and goods by the women. Those staying at home should be especially vigilant and on guard, so as not to be fooled.</p>

<p>China Soap Company Celebration Banquet. The China Soap Company, located at No. 18 the Bund, Shanghai, has a prosperous business. Its products, such as Lux Soap, Sunlight Soap, and Xiangcheng Soap, are well-known. This spring, the company introduced a new goods-for-coupon system, and the drawing was held on the 12th. At 2 PM, the drawing took place at the company's soap factory in Yangshupu. Managers from various districts and foreign guests were invited to supervise. After the drawing, the guests were accompanied on a tour of the factory, and they admired the perfection of the internal equipment. That evening, a spring business celebration banquet was held at Yipinxiang, attracting a large crowd. Before the banquet, Mr. Robesen, the general manager of the company, gave a speech and awarded prizes. Among the district business comparisons, Mr. Qi Huichang, manager of the Shanghai district, achieved the best results and won a large silver shield. Mr. Chen Shanqing of the Haimen Department of Jiangsu Province won the personal championship. The other five winners, Li Zhiqin, Chen Liangfu, Zhu Xiulin, Wang Daren, and Zhang Zihe, each received a silver cigarette case.</p>
<p>Xuyuan to Be Transformed into Amusement Park. Xuyuan, located on Connaught Road in West Shanghai, is the most famous private garden in Shanghai. It has been established for over 20 years. The internal architecture includes various flowers and trees, as well as pavilions, terraces, and quadrangles. It is grand in scale and usually used for festive occasions. However, many people buy tickets to visit during the hot summer months. Recently, the owner of the garden, to provide social convenience for people to cool off in the summer, plans to open the garden to the public, collect various noble amusements, and build an open-air cinema, a golf course, a dance hall, and a billiard room in the garden. It is expected to open around the time of the Dragon Boat Festival.</p>
<p>Record of Lie Feng Silk Factory's Banquet. To promote domestic products and save the silk industry, the Lie Feng Silk Factory invited managers from Shanghai Guohuo, China Guohuo, Sincere, Wing On, New World, and other companies, as well as managers from Lao Jie Fu and other silk shops, to a banquet at the Dadong Restaurant yesterday to discuss solutions. More than 100 people attended. First, Xu Peikun, manager of Lie Feng, explained in detail how the factory had carefully improved its products and invented silk fabrics such as Wild Goose Feather, Bi He, and Diao Chan crepe, which were superior to imported products and were popular for a time. Recently, some people have engaged in unwarranted dumping, which has disrupted the market and affected the livelihoods of workers. He requested support. Wu Zhihao said that promoting domestic products is a way to resist foreign goods. The silk industry has a history of over 4,000 years, but it has declined due to a lack of unity. He hoped that the industry would unite to save the situation. Zhang Zilian said that he hoped the silk shops would share their experiences with the factories to improve production, and that they would encourage customers to use domestic products to benefit the people. As a result, everyone agreed that the silk industry has declined sharply in recent years, causing many people to lose their jobs in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. They were determined to unite, not to engage in infighting, and to save the industry.</p>

The Shanghai Weekly Press, due to the deepening threat of bandits and the urgent national crisis, believed that the Chinese people were at risk of being subjected to war anytime, anywhere. They realized that the Chinese people lacked knowledge of wartime matters. Recalling the January 28th Incident, the number of fellow countrymen who died was hard to count. They then collected all kinds of knowledge related to wartime and compiled the book "Essential Knowledge for People in Wartime." The first edition of 10,000 copies was sold out. It has now been reprinted with 50,000 copies. For the sake of widespread publicity, the company only charges the cost of five cents per copy.

<p>New Contribution to Women's Health. The greatest influence on women's health is menstruation. According to accurate statistics from famous European doctors, eight or nine out of ten women's diseases are due to menstrual irregularities. This number is alarming enough. Chinese women often avoid discussing this disease, and its impact on their health is immeasurable. It has recently come to our attention that Dr. Bi Fengzhang of Shanghai has specially compiled a book called "Women's Health Guide," which is being given to women. The book describes the causes, symptoms, and treatments of menstrual irregularities in detail. All women can send a letter to Shanghai P.O. Box 840 to request a copy.</p>

<h3 id="e177">Regarding a Collection of Letters Discussing the Question of "Can We Return to the Countryside?" <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>(6) Letter from Mr. Hu Nianzhu of this city: I come from the countryside</p>
<p>I saw the discussion about going to the countryside in your column, which evoked my memories because I am just a country bumpkin from the countryside. My family, though not landlords, could still be considered grain rentiers. My family has a village estate with good waterways, fertile land, far from major villages, not connected to main roads, located in Shanggao County, a very undeveloped area in Jiangxi. Moreover, this estate is not in poor valleys and deep mountains, never visited by soldiers or bandits, and with no danger of harboring bandits. What a peaceful place! I originally had a plan to build an ideal rural village here, but I encountered difficulties as soon as I started. Someone like me, who has never been exposed to the sun, what skills do I have to deal with these dozens of acres of land? Hire a farmhand? You need to know that in the countryside, if you want to hire a teacher, you only need to say a word, and someone will recommend one from here or there. But if you want a long-term worker, it is indeed a bit troublesome. Needless to say, the usual practice is to pay half a year or a year's wages in advance. If they are good, they won't cause you to lose money. If they are not good, they might take on work for three or four landlords at the same time, or they might run away after working for half a year, or even before starting work. To be honest, it is almost impossible to be an idler in the countryside! The strange phenomena in the countryside are very worthy of our attention. On one hand, the population is rapidly decreasing; on the other hand, the amount of wasteland is increasing day by day. At the same time, on the other hand, a large number of vagrants are being produced. This contradictory phenomenon is obviously not just about the tillers not owning their land, but about owning land but not being able to till it. On one hand, there is the endless addition of exorbitant taxes and levies, but the biggest fundamental reason is due to the encroachment of foreign capitalism into the countryside, which has increased the level of rural life. At the same time, the prices of agricultural products have relatively decreased, especially in the last year or two. This has led to the bankruptcy of the rural economy, and many farmers have become soldiers and bandits. Naturally, these displaced farmers are not only transformed from producers into non-producers, but also from child-bearers into non-child-bearers, thus affecting the tragedy of abandoning baby girls, which is becoming more and more intense. If this continues, China's 400 million compatriots may not need the Japanese to trouble themselves! Editor, you are like an experienced self-cultivating farmer, even you have a crisis and the possibility of bankruptcy in the countryside. How can people who are used to city life make a living in the countryside? Mr. You Huaigao, please enlighten me. People in the city are forced to a dead end and want to go to the countryside; people in the countryside are forced to a dead end and want to go to the city. Where is the broad road? Also, can the economic bankruptcy and rural unrest caused by the relative decrease in agricultural product prices, the rapid increase in rural living standards, and the endless addition of exorbitant taxes and levies be remedied by rural education?</p>
<p>(7) Letter from Mr. Zhu Ying of this city: Under the current situation, going back to the countryside is practically impossible</p>
<p>The reporter introduced Mr. You Huaigao, saying: "Mr. You advocates rural education to save the country. He has done a lot of research on rural education and is also a practitioner." Indeed, after reading his reply to Mr. Xiongsheng's letter, his detailed and practical methods are beyond what empty theorists can utter. However, Mr. You said: "With my ability, I will spend ten years to build a new-style Arcadia in my imagination." Who doesn't dream of such a new-style Arcadia, who doesn't want to realize it immediately? Unfortunately, in China today, the entire rural economy is bankrupt, and people are struggling to survive. Where is there any extra strength to allow others to operate for a long time? Moreover, the resulting confrontation between two forces, which is already very obvious in some places, and though not very obvious in some places, is also advancing secretly in the undercurrent, these situations are difficult problems to deal with in the countryside. For example, according to Mr. You's method, if you return to the countryside and run such a school, which side will you take in the confrontation between the two forces? Taking the side of the powerful seems not to be the purpose of running a school; taking the side of the powerless will definitely be oppressed by the powerful. As for saying that you don't have any relationship with either side, that conflicts with Mr. You's so-called "spreading goodwill in the village"; and it is also absolutely impossible in reality. Although the countryside in the Jiangzhe area is relatively better in some places at present, after two or three years of invasion by imperialists and the gradual exploitation by domestic evil forces, won't it end up with the same fate! Therefore, it is probably impossible to build a new-style Arcadia in any part of China within ten years. Therefore, if Mr. Xiongsheng returns to the countryside, I am afraid that not only will he not achieve his lofty goals, but even his kind of "no courage to break the law, no courage to commit suicide" factor (the problem of livelihood) will still not be eliminated. Mr. You is a person who studies education, or perhaps he has a different vision for this field, we cannot know, I hope to be enlightened!</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3 id="e179">Declaration of the Jiangsu Provincial Secondary School Education Association <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Implement Wartime Education</p>
<p>Overall Air Force Plan</p>
<p>Monthly Allocation of Funds</p>
<p>The 12th Congress of the Jiangsu Provincial Secondary School Education Association was held at Wuxi Normal School at the beginning of this month. Its proposals have already been published. The declaration of the association is as follows:</p>
<p>In the Franco-Prussian War, Germany became a superpower with one battle. Observers did not attribute it to the generals and soldiers at the front, but to the teachers in the schools. German Chancellor Bismarck said, "The power of one teacher is greater than that of 100,000 Mausers." The Japanese learned from this, and in the Russo-Japanese War, the whole country embraced a common hatred of the enemy, and they also became a superpower with one battle. Looking back at our country, the invaders are deep, and the situation is urgent. The four northeastern provinces have fallen under the iron hooves of the Japanese, and there is a growing tendency to cross the Great Wall and let their horses drink in the Yellow River to the south. The rivers and mountains are shrinking day by day, and the country is almost no longer a country. We, who are shamelessly occupying the ranks of secondary school teachers, dare not lag behind others in avenging our enemies. Since we have not served on the battlefield, we should devote our efforts to the lecture hall. We believe that the decline of the country is due to many reasons, such as the weakness of the people's patriotic concepts, due to the thinness of national consciousness, the lack of national defense, the incompleteness of military preparations, due to the lack of manufacturing, the lack of talent, and the daily urgency of the people's livelihoods, due to the lack of industrial and commercial prosperity, which is also due to the lack of scientific precision. After decades of education, learning has not been able to be applied, so we believe that today's education has the following three points: (1) We must arouse a strong national consciousness, so that young people can clearly understand where integrity lies; (2) We must improve the level of various disciplines, and instill in young people as much practical and useful scientific knowledge as possible, so that what they learn is practical and becomes the foundation of China's production education; (3) We must pay attention to military training, and cultivate young people's simple, hardworking, disciplined, organized, firm, and brave spirit. Today is a very special period for our country, and we should implement a very special education, in other words, wartime education, education for national salvation. All our facilities today must be based on our lifeline as the starting point. The above three points are the education for a very special period, the education for national salvation. We carefully endure the pain and propose it as a preparation for the rear support of the soldiers at the front, which is our view on education.</p>
<p>Since the war at the front is urgent, and the people have a patriotic enthusiasm, there have been donations from all sides to purchase aircraft. My colleagues dare not lag behind others in patriotism. Therefore, it was decided at this congress that, starting from this month, we will donate a percentage of our salary and deposit it in the bank, designated as a special savings fund for the development of China's air force. The intention is not just to provide a drop in the bucket, because the amount is very small, and we are not able to purchase aircraft for a while. But in fact, we are not yet clear to what extent our people are preparing for the country's air defense. We do not want to repeat the mistake of the 300 aircraft in the Northeast, which were used by the enemy. We deeply hope that the government and society will pay attention to the overall problem of the Chinese Air Force, and have a thorough solution, such as the cultivation of aviation talents, the manufacture of aircraft, and the plans for air defense in various places. We are willing for everyone to have savings for the development of a special air force fund, and at the same time hope that the government will realize the above thorough solution. In this way, we can achieve the practical effect of resisting Japan and saving the country. This is by no means a pedantic talk, and we are willing to share this concern with the people of the country. This is our view on donating our salary to save the country.</p>
<p>Education is the fundamental economy for saving the country, and funding is the lifeline of education. For five years of the European War, the sound of learning never stopped. The details of Jiangsu's education funding are probably not known to outsiders. The salaries of colleagues are in arrears for four months. The Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office is an agency in charge of special education funds. It has just released the funding for December. The lives of teachers and staff are deeply painful, and school facilities cannot be developed, all suffering from the impact of insufficient education funding. My colleagues, in order to prepare for the wartime education in this extraordinary period, also have to discuss education funding. We deeply understand that the administrative authorities and people from all walks of life pay attention to the importance of funding, take responsibility for their positions, and allocate funds on a monthly basis without further delays, so that teachers and staff do not have to worry about a lack of supplies, then when my colleagues devote themselves to the lecture hall, it is no different from serving on the battlefield, which is our view on education funding.</p>
<p>My colleagues, at the time of bright spring, used the rest of the spring break to gather in Wuxi to discuss education issues and draw up guidelines for the future. I hope that all parties will correct us, which would be a great blessing. This is our declaration.</p>

<h3 id="e188">Grade Calculation Methods <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>(1) Grade calculation uses the percentage method as the standard. Decimals below integers are rounded to the nearest integer. 80 to 100 points is grade A, 70 to 79 points is grade B, 60 to 69 points is grade C, 50 to 59 points is grade D, and less than 50 points is grade E. A, B, and C are passing grades, and D and E are failing grades.</p>
<p>(2) Calculate the percentage of each subject in the total examination time of each subject in primary school based on the time taught each week in each subject. Multiply the percentage by the examination score of each subject, and then add them together and divide by 100 to get the overall average score. For example, as follows:</p>
<p>Primary School Grade Calculation Method</p>
<p>Subject | Teaching Time Per Week | Score | Percentage | Examination Score | Percentage Multiplied by Actual Score</p>
<p>---|---|---|---|---|---</p>
<p>Chinese | 390 | | 44.80 | 50 | 22.40</p>
<p>Arithmetic | 180 | | 20.70 | 60 | 12.42</p>
<p>Social Studies | 150 | | 17.25 | 70 | 12.07</p>
<p>Nature | 150 | | 17.25 | 60 | 10.35</p>
<p>Total | 870 | | 100 | 240 | 57.24</p>
<p>(3) The method of calculating grades in junior high and senior high schools (general curriculum) is based on the temporary curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry of Education. The percentage of the total credits of each subject in the sum of the total credits of each subject for three academic years is multiplied by the score obtained in this examination and added together to get the average of the student's overall grade. For example, as shown in the following table:</p>
<p>Junior High School Grade Calculation Method</p>
<p>Subject | Examination Score | Credits | Percentage | Examination Score Multiplied by Percentage | Each Subject's Score</p>
<p>---|---|---|---|---|---</p>
<p>Party Principles | A | 12 | 0.08 | A |</p>
<p>Chinese | B | 36 | 0.24 | B |</p>
<p>History | C | 12 | 0.08 | C |</p>
<p>Geography | D | 12 | 0.08 | D |</p>
<p>Arithmetic | E | 30 | 0.21 | E |</p>
<p>Natural Science | F | 15 | 0.10 | F |</p>
<p>Foreign Language | G | 30 | 0.21 | G |</p>
<p>Total | | X = Overall Average</p>
<p>Senior High School (General Curriculum) Grade Calculation Method</p>
<p>Subject | Examination Score | Credits | Percentage | Examination Score Multiplied by Percentage | Each Subject's Score</p>
<p>---|---|---|---|---|---</p>
<p>Party Principles | A | 6 | 0.05 | A |</p>

<p>Since the Patriotic Girls' School moved back to its original site at Chen Garden on Jiangwan Road after the January 28th Incident, it has been actively restoring and building new dormitories and enriching its facilities. In terms of education and training, it is also striving for improvement. The number of students this semester has increased. Historically, the school has always been a leader in physical education, with a reputation overseas. In recent years, it has been actively promoting popular sports, aiming to enable every student to have a healthy physique and spirit. To realize this plan, great importance is attached to morning exercises. Students are trained in various exercises such as Taijiquan, track and field events, and rhythmic gymnastics, allowing them to choose according to their interests, resulting in strong interest and full spirit.

<p>The Fudan University Anti-Japanese Association fundraising basketball game was held last night at the school's gymnasium. The first game was between the Fudan Women's team and the Dongya Women's Physical Education School team. The two teams were meeting for the first time and were mutually yielding. However, the Dongya team's skills were outstanding, and their coordination was effective. As a result, they defeated Fudan 23 to 16. Next, the men took the field. Fudan and Qingguang had been opponents for a long time, so they were well aware of each other's strengths and weaknesses. The scores went back and forth. In the first half, Fudan scored 20. They tightened their defense as Qingguang was missing their key player, Xu Kepei. As a result, Qingguang lost to Fudan 42 to 52.</p>

<p>An Unprecedented Feat by the Baihong Track and Field Team</p>
<p>Starting at Chen YingShi Tower at 8:00 AM</p>
<p>A Total of Eighteen Athletes Participating</p>
<p>The unprecedented 216-kilometer Shanghai-Hangzhou long-distance race, initiated by the Baihong Track and Field Team, will start at 8:00 AM this morning at Chen YingShi Tower in Ximen. A total of eighteen athletes are participating. It is expected that they will arrive at the bronze statue of Chen YingShi on the West Lake within four days, marking a grand beginning to a new era in Chinese sports.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Baihong Declaration <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>In the past, we have often seen long-distance races held in foreign countries, from one city to another, taking seven or eight days or more than ten days, covering six or seven hundred or more than a thousand miles. The scale is grand and truly sufficient to demonstrate the spirit of martial valor. I secretly admired it. Looking back at China's sports undertakings, they seem to rise and fall, seeming to be invigorated and seeming to decline. It is not easy to ask those in power to organize this kind of long-distance running. Although those in power are difficult to expect, it is not hopeless to spontaneously rise up, plan, and carry out. Since the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway was recently built, the long distance is a place for heroes to show their skills. The desire to try among colleagues is even more unstoppable. Therefore, we consulted with all parties and were fortunate to receive support. This long-distance run can be observed, which will make a considerable contribution to sports in our country. It is our hope that all participating athletes will strive to achieve this.</p>

<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>The peach blossom is a pure folk writer. It especially likes to adorn the scenery for the people of humble dwellings. It always happily paints and depicts places that the aristocratic writer peony and the bureaucratic writer peony disdain to look at. Passersby on the road, seeing the colors of its writing, will happily forget their own toil. All contemporary men of letters especially bring wine to appreciate its folk literature. This shows that its great works truly have value that can be appreciated by both the refined and the vulgar. Moreover, in summer and autumn, the conclusion of its writing is always so sweet that people cannot bear to let it go.</p>
<p>Someone said: "The peach blossom is a writer who submits one manuscript to four different places. It can only create this one article, but the places where it is published are four different places, either on the tree, in the air, on the ground, or on the water. Although the locations are different, the materials are the same. Isn't this submitting one manuscript to four different places?" I said: Not so. Although the materials are the same, there are four articles. The one it writes on the tree is so splendid and colorful, like fire and tea. The one written in the air, "It will fly again as a whirling wind dance, already falling still presenting half a face makeup," how heavenly and ethereal! The one written on the ground, contrasting with the emerald green ground cover, how scattered and embellished, everywhere becomes a profound truth. The one written on the water, "Flowing water and falling flowers, spring is gone, heaven and earth," how touching and evocative, tying people's dreams? The ancients admired its writing, only admiring the one written on the water, calling it "Falling flowers on the water are all writing." In fact, its four articles are all good, and the one written on the water is especially its masterpiece of "that turn of the eye before leaving."</p>
<h3 id="e207">Trivial News of Liang Shiyi's Death <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Yong</p>
<p>Liang Shiyi's death has been reported previously. It is now heard that Chinese and foreign acquaintances have been coming to pay their respects in an endless stream, because Liang had extremely wide social connections during his lifetime. His family, because Liang had been living in a foreign country and was often depressed, plans to have a memorial service in Shanghai and then transport the coffin back to Guangdong, without going to Hong Kong again. Also, the funeral ceremony will strictly follow his grandfather's teachings, without using drums and music, without using monks and Taoists, not choosing auspicious days, and using extremely simple methods in everything to correct customs, it is said.</p>
<p>Before Liang went north, he wrote a poem, saying: "Snowy hair stroked, the midday dream is broken, plum blossoms on the riverbank and willows look the same, five thousand miles away are twin granddaughters, forty years ago I was an old historian, not showing off my writing to amaze the world, only leaving my blood to be sprinkled on the riverbank, cheering the group of younger brothers to sharpen their long swords, looking far at the New Pavilion, wanting to take the saddle." At that time, the atmosphere on the border was already bad, and Liang wanted to go to Peiping with some plans, so his words said so. What he called "leaving my blood to be sprinkled on the riverbank" was considered strange by many readers, but now he died on the Huangpu Riverbank, also a poetic premonition. Liang wrote very few poems in his life, and this is his last poem, it is said.</p>
<p>Liang's family finances are not very abundant, not as rumored outside, but all his sons are able to support themselves with a skill. Recently, related parties have discussed sending condolences, but his family plans to transfer them to public welfare memorial purposes, and the specific method will be discussed in detail by relatives and friends, it is said.</p>
<p>Liang had a very close private friendship with Duan Zhigui and Tang Shaoyi because of the Xinhai Revolution. Duan, hearing of Liang's death, repeatedly sent people to express condolences while ill. Tang Shaoyi sent a telegram from Guangdong, expressing his grief, and will personally send a eulogy portrait to Shanghai, it is said.</p>

<p>The fleeting time, since I quietly left Shanghai and went north stealthily, has been almost a month. Half a month ago, I mailed a brief note telling you fragments of my life, and in theory, you should have received it earlier!</p>
<p>Our organization has now been renamed the "Liao Ji Hei People's Support ×× Team". Although I am still in training, the work is also very intense: four hours of strict training, two hours of sentry duty, and a 30-mile run are the fixed routine every day. Two meals a day of sorghum and cabbage have created my strong muscles and determined will! The bugle calls in the army constantly spread out tragic tones! I am excited. I feel that only military life makes me excited!</p>

Of course, we are constantly eager to kill the Japanese devils with our own hands and shed blood on the battlefield! We will use fresh blood to wash away our humiliation! We will use our heads to exchange for 　　who knew that when I walked to the accounting department of the newspaper office, the window opening, which was a foot high and half a foot wide, although not crowded with people, was squeezed with six or seven fellow contributors. Tall, short, fat, thin, Western suits and leather shoes, long gowns and short jackets, all styles were available, all kinds were complete. There was also a Miss Cao ××, the daughter of Father Jin Shenfu Road, (or perhaps she was), also squeezed in the crowd to collect manuscript fees for Mr. Cao. I knew a little about the civilization brought by the foreign adults, so I immediately stood behind Miss Cao. Then came another one, two, three, the former had not left, the latter came again, everyone holding a payment slip in their hands. Small slips, one after another, looked like porridge tickets for relieving hungry people.</p>
<p>Everyone lengthened their necks, waiting for the opening, the first one wanted to go to the toilet, the second one was impatient and would come back later, the third one..., so that those standing behind could get to the front earlier. But this was wishful thinking, just like hoping for a major earthquake in Japan to automatically abandon the Northeast, like a blind man hoping for the sky to collapse. In this tense atmosphere where everyone's hot sweat rolled from their foreheads all the way to their waists, footsteps thudded, and another university student-style comrade joined this group of people. Suddenly, this comrade discovered that the second person standing outside the opening was an old friend, went forward to shake hands, squeezed their shoulder, and cut in line to be the third person. Fortunately, these comrades were all civilized, so everyone stepped back one position and waited patiently.</p>

<p>Gui Zhi stirred the lotus root powder with a small teaspoon, scraping around the surface, taking a little bit and sending it to her mouth, smiling and lifting her shoulder, then lowering her eyelids and humming, "You're definitely lying." Ji Zhi hurriedly looked at her and asked, "What have I lied about?" Gui Zhi said, "Didn't you say at my house the other day that you were going to teach the servants a lesson? How come now you say you don't dare to offend the servants and maids at all?" These words immediately put Ji Zhi in an extremely awkward position, and he had to chuckle for a while before nodding his head and saying, "Your question is very reasonable. But that day, I was really angry. It's not a lie that I said in front of you that I would go back and teach them a lesson." Gui Zhi said, "Then that day, you must have given the servants and maids a big lesson when you went back." After saying that, she chuckled. Ji Zhi said, "You naturally understand, I can't scold them too much, because they're not using my money and working for me." Gui Zhi laughed and said, "Then you scolded them a little." Ji Zhi said, "But after my investigation, I can't blame the servants either. How would they dare to offend the neighbors?" Gui Zhi said, "I said that day that without orders from above, the people below wouldn't dare to act recklessly, but you always had to cover up for the people in your mansion. Now, this is news that you yourself have revealed." Ji Zhi said, "I admit that I'm very sorry to you, but I can't help it, you should forgive me." Gui Zhi continued to slowly eat the lotus root powder, but didn't pay attention to Ji Zhi's words. Seeing that she still didn't show any sign of forgiveness, Ji Zhi sighed for no reason. Seeing that he looked unhappy, Gui Zhi then asked, "Why are you sighing again?" Ji Zhi said, "Why shouldn't I sigh? We've been neighbors for a year now. You know what kind of attitude I've had over the past year. Now, just because of a little misunderstanding, you don't trust me to this extent." Gui Zhi said, "I don't have any reason to distrust you!" She said, then smiled slightly. Ji Zhi said, "How much more distrust do you want? You don't believe anything I say, thinking that I'm lying to you in front of you. I only have... "As he said this, he looked at Gui Zhi, hesitated for a while, and then stammered, "If I had some money in hand now and could start a small family, I would proceed... Then you would trust me."

<p>After writing manuscripts for a month, pouring out my heart and soul, I waited eagerly for the end of the month. I respectfully wrote a payment slip. Without asking the seal official to stamp it, I grabbed my own seal, used all my strength to stamp it, and took off with my flying legs, taking two steps in three, straight to Wangping Street. All the way, I calculated, last month's performance was good, I might not get five yuan for manuscript fees, but four yuan, ninety-nine cents, I wouldn't get a cent less. This month, a pair of shoes, three pairs of socks, would be taken care of. With the extra, I could eat two meals of Russian cuisine. At least it would be foreign flavor.</p>

<p>This place is full of the vitality of ordinary people. Sampans that are generally drifting along are constantly gathering here. Their lives are so casual and sacred! Everyone must use their own strength to feed themselves, except for young children who cannot walk yet. Ah! The pride of the era!</p>
<p>Recently, a very dilapidated sampan came to the riverbank in front of our door. The male owner of this boat is a rickshaw puller, considered the most lowly in society. The female owner is also a woman worker who smashes stones, invisible to the eyes of adults and gentlemen. They have a thirteen- or fourteen-year-old son who brings a basket of pancakes and fried dough sticks to sell everywhere every morning, an eleven- or twelve-year-old daughter who goes to the factory every day to pick up coal cinders, and an eight- or nine-year-old daughter who glues and folds various red and green paper toys on the boat, preparing them for her brother to sell. Her part-time job is to lead a three-year-old brother and take care of the house. The sampan is truly a family of strength like them, the most modern family.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I happened to be walking with my wife Zhiyun at the door when I saw them gathered on the narrow stern of the boat, enjoying the fruits of their labor with their blood and sweat - green vegetables - snails - rice.</p>
<p>"These people are really suffering!" Zhiyun noticed their rice bowls and sighed to me. "I think there are probably very few people happier than them!" I replied. "You're talking nonsense again!" She seemed to be blaming me.</p>
<p>After a moment of silence:</p>
<p>"Oh, look how dirty their bedding is!" She seemed to have forgotten my nonsense and whispered to me. "Dirty? I think it's cleaner than those concubines in big mansions!" I smiled. She said I was talking nonsense, disliked me, she went inside, so I chatted with the male owner, the rickshaw puller, again: "A Gui! How many years have you been pulling a rickshaw?"</p>
<p>"Only been pulling for more than a year!"</p>
<p>"What did you do before?"</p>
<p>"Pushing a cart! Working as a dock worker!"</p>
<p>"Why didn't you pull a rickshaw before?"</p>
<p>"Our lives are uncertain. When we hear that a place is better, we move there. There's no need to move a car, and there's no need for coolies to move a car, because our home - the sampan - is very convenient to move back and forth. And we have the strength to do anything, so we don't have to identify one line to do. For example, in Shanghai, because there are many trams and buses, pulling a rickshaw is not profitable, I'll work as a dock worker. This year, coming here to pull a rickshaw, business is not bad!"</p>
<p>"Then how much money can you make a day now?"</p>
<p>"Excluding the rickshaw rent, I can make one or two strings of cash every day!"</p>
<p>"How much money can your wife earn smashing stones every day?"</p>
<p>"She can't do it, at most five or six hundred cash a day!"</p>
<p>"How much can your son earn selling pancakes a day?"</p>
<p>"A hundred cash!"</p>
<p>"How much money can your daughter sell for picking up coal cinders?"</p>
<p>"Coal cinders are used to cook rice, not sold for money!"</p>
<p>"How much can your little daughter earn making paper figures a day?"</p>
<p>"At most one or two hundred cash!"</p>
<p>"How much rice does your family eat every day?"</p>
<p>"Always five or six liters!"</p>
<p>"And miscellaneous expenses?"</p>
<p>"We are poor people and don't have any miscellaneous expenses. We don't even drink tea. The only things we can't save on are soap and haircuts, which average one or two yuan a month, which is enough!"</p>
<p>"Then your income is enough to cover your expenses! Do you have any surplus every day?"</p>
<p>"As it stands now, we can have more than one string of cash surplus every day!"</p>
<p>"How do you use the surplus money?"</p>
<p>"Prepare to add some clothes or make up for it when business is bad!"</p>
<p>Night fell, the earth gradually darkened, and our conversation also ended. I was happy because I discovered one corner of life that people never pay attention to, and moreover, it is an unexpectedly happy family.</p>

<h3 id="e212">The Chinese People's Life Circle <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— He Jia Gan</p>
<p>"Even ants know how to cherish life," and Chinese people have always called themselves "ant people." For the sake of temporarily preserving my own life, I often pay attention to relatively safe places. Apart from heroes and outstanding individuals, I presume no one would mock me for this.</p>
<p>However, I don't quite believe positive reports; I often look at things from a different perspective. For example, when the newspapers say that Peiping is preparing for air defense, I don't find it reassuring. But when I see antiques being transported south, I immediately sense the crisis of the ancient city and, from the whereabouts of these antiques, I infer the location of a Chinese paradise.</p>
<p>Now, batches of antiques are being concentrated in Shanghai, indicating that the safest place is still the Shanghai International Settlement.</p>
<p>However, rents are bound to rise.</p>
<p>This is also a major blow to the "ant people," so we still need to think of other places.</p>
<p>After much deliberation, I thought of a "life circle." That is to say, it's neither the "hinterland" nor the "border," but something in between, like a ring or a circle. In this place, one might be able to "eke out a living in troubled times."</p>
<p>On the "border," airplanes drop bombs. According to Japanese newspapers, they are "剿滅" (exterminating) "soldier bandits"; according to Chinese newspapers, they are slaughtering the people, leaving villages and markets in ruins. In the "hinterland," airplanes also drop bombs. According to Shanghai newspapers, they are "剿滅" (exterminating) "communist bandits," who are being bombed to pieces. What do the "communist bandits'" newspapers say? We don't know. But in short, on the border, it's bomb, bomb, bomb; in the hinterland, it's also bomb, bomb, bomb. Although on one side, it's others bombing, and on the other, it's ourselves bombing, the bombers are different, but the bombed are the same. Only in the space between these two, as long as the bombs don't accidentally fall down, there is still hope of avoiding "flesh and blood flying everywhere." Therefore, I call it the "Chinese People's Life Circle."</p>
<p>If bombs come from outside, this "life circle" will shrink into a "life line"; if more bombs come, everyone will flee into the already bombed "hinterland," and this "life circle" will end as a "life zero."</p>
<p>In fact, everyone has this premonition. Just look at how, in the past year, we no longer see the cliché "China has a vast territory, abundant resources, and a large population" in articles. That's one piece of evidence. And one gentleman even said in a speech that Chinese people are a "weak nation."</p>
<p>But the big shots don't think so, because they not only have airplanes but also their "foreign country"!</p>
<h3 id="e213">On National Language <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Yutang</p>
<p>"National Language" is the shortened form of "Chinese people's language." For Chinese people, it's unnecessary to say the word "Chinese" because everyone already understands. Speaking this way, the term "National Language" is different from other foreign languages, and its meaning is similar to "National Medicine," "National Scolding," and "National Food," where the focus is on the word "National." Therefore, what resembles the language of Chinese people is "National Language," and what doesn't is not. For example, when Feng Yuxiang once sent a telegram scolding Wu Zhihui as a "hoary-bearded old thief, white-haired rascal," we felt that this wasn't "National Language" because it didn't sound like how Chinese people would speak and didn't fit the style of Chinese telegrams. When Zhang Xueliang sent a telegram resigning, saying, "The day I'm alive is the year I'll repay the country," we read it and thought it sounded like Chinese people would say, so it was proper "National Language."</p>
<p>I've often said that what is called "通" (tōng - fluent) in Chinese is what is called "idiomatic" in Western languages. "通" (tōng) is not just about being fluent, but about conforming to language habits, which isn't just a matter of grammar. Anything that conforms to Chinese grammar or language habits is called "通" (tōng). For example, in the Spring and Autumn Annals, "夏，享公" (Xia, Xiang Duke), even though there's no subject, it can still be considered "通" (tōng) because it conforms to language habits. Also, when Duke of Wei, Qin Hui, negotiated peace by ceding land, he wrote an amnesty to the Henan state army. Wuturu thought the "National Language" was not fluent because he did not elaborate upon the Great Jin's virtues. So, Hui ordered Cheng Kejun to write: "The heavens regret the disaster, fulfilling the spirits' wish to govern with peace of mind; the great nation practices benevolence, fulfilling the filial piety of children to their parents. This can be called a most grand occasion. How dare we forget the deep kindness that must be repaid..." Thereupon, Wuturu thought this was very fluent "National Language" because phrases like "benevolence," "filial piety," "grand occasion," and "deep kindness" all conform to Chinese language habits.</p>
<p>A country's language is where a country's cultural elites entrust their thoughts, so each can express its distinct national spirit. In China, due to special circumstances, reading became the exclusive privilege of a special class, so writing became even more ingenious, and the meaning of "writing" became particularly unique. It generally has the meaning of ornate writing, something orderly and colorful is called writing. Therefore, only Chinese has the term "文章" (wén zhāng - writing). The Western term "Belles-Lettres" is still far from the meaning of "文章" (wén zhāng - writing). For example, "不抵抗" (bù dǐ kàng - non-resistance) is plain speech, but "長期抵抗" (cháng qī dǐ kàng - long-term resistance) has literary flourish and is writing. "不攘外" (bù rǎng wài - don't expel the foreigners) is plain speech, but "先安内" (xiān ān nèi - first pacify the interior) has literary flourish and is writing. This kind of "National Language" is something foreign languages don't have. As for military men suddenly wanting to fight, they must also "師出有名" (shī chū yǒu míng - have a justified cause) or comfort the people or punish the guilty. When their memorial to the throne is written well, if it is coherent, eloquent, and meaningful, scholars will eagerly spread it and praise it. The only ones who don't understand and are fooled are the common people who don't know the meaning and rules of writing.</p>
<p>Here are three things to know about writing "National Language":</p>
<p>(1) Indirect Expression: Mencius said that expressing oneself clearly is the essence of writing, the true way, and unchanging for all time. However, this can only be said for sages and wise people. Because clarity is wonderful, but we are not sages, and what we want to express may be ordinary. Therefore, mere clarity cannot be writing; it must be embellished with literary flourish. Therefore, Xunzi went a step further, advocating "曲得所謂" (qū dé suǒ wèi - obtaining the desired effect indirectly). The "Non-Physiognomy" chapter says, "Gentlemen are never tired of speaking, but the vulgar are the opposite, liking the substance but not caring about the style, so they can never avoid being base and vulgar." The writing of Mozi's followers, for example, is like liking the substance but not caring about the style. Because they don't care about the style, right and wrong are clear, but there is no beauty of "曲得所謂" (qū dé suǒ wèi - obtaining the desired effect indirectly), so they are vulgar for life. The vulgar cannot write "deeply worded and comprehensively inclusive" articles.</p>
<p>(2) Withholding: Barbarians who go to war capture one and eat one. They never have what is called "desiring to capture, therefore releasing," so they never enjoy the glory of Meng Huo being captured seven times. The tactics of capturing and releasing in warfare are the tactics of withholding in writing. The commentator thought that Feng Yuxiang's words, quoted above, were too blunt and lacked restraint. Feng suffered from this because he did not know the importance of withholding. Speaking exhaustively invites blame. There is a clear saying of ancient times, so those who are good at writing must not speak exhaustively, leaving something unfinished for future meetings. Therefore, writing must use more words like "however," "then also," "if," and "may also." As the poem says, "Turn it left, turn it left, the gentleman is suited; turn it right, turn it right, the gentleman possesses it." If it's suitable on the left and possessed on the right, it will have endless benefits in the future, and this is the gentleman.</p>
<p>(3) Lightness: Writing should avoid haste, revealing, and blurting out, as mentioned above. But to avoid haste and revealing, one must first cultivate the mind and nature, read ten thousand books, and have an open mind, which is called cultivation. Words are the voice of the heart, so to write Chinese people's language, one must first have a Chinese person's heart. Therefore, writing must first cultivate life, raise geese, plant chrysanthemums, watch clouds, and appreciate the moon, so that the heart is light. Then, looking at oneself, worldly affairs are like floating clouds, and reclaiming the Northeast is good, and giving away the four provinces is fine too. At this point, one can then lightly extend the wrist, and casually hold the writing brush between the thumb and middle finger; not fast, not slow, not heavy, not light, relying on the contact between the brush and the white paper, quietly writing out one word at a time, like watching a fire from across the river, commenting on right and wrong, debating without arguing, observing without getting excited, not left, not right, 母適, 母必 (do not force, do not insist), like war and like peace, like sunny and like rainy. Leftists read it as tragic, rightists read it as gentle, and adding a couple of sentences from Wang Yangming's "cultivating the mind" will make it very elegant.</p>
<p>These three methods: indirect expression can also be called the "setting off the moon with clouds" method, withholding can also be called the "dragon turning, phoenix dancing" method, and lightness can also be called the "watching the fire from across the river" method. When the work of these three methods is refined, one becomes a Chinese literati.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Suffering <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Tianwei</p>
<p>This is one of the most unforgettable things in my childhood. This tragic scene is forever etched on my heart. The more I try to forget it, the clearer it appears.</p>
<p>I was nine years old then, and my younger brother was only six years old. My older brother was three years older than me. That year, there was a drought, and there was often not a single grain of rice in the house, and naturally no money either. Father had already gone out. Mother and Grandmother often whispered to each other, with tears in their eyes, looking so pained.</p>
<p>One day, I heard Mother say to Grandmother:</p>
<p>"We absolutely can't let the three children eat like that, and Mom can't eat like that either. Only I..."</p>
<p>I didn't understand why Mother said that. "I can't eat?" What couldn't she eat? I was suspicious.</p>
<p>"Let me suffer! When their father comes back, there will always be some money for us, even if it's just a dime. Now, I can only keep doing this..." As Mother said this, more tears flowed. Grandmother also wept.</p>
<p>I was a sensitive and melancholic child. Seeing Mother and Grandmother so sad, I felt very uncomfortable. I didn't know what they were sad about, and I didn't dare to ask. At dinner, Mother brought us four bowls of porridge. My older brother and younger brother swallowed their bowls of porridge quickly without thinking. I pretended that the porridge was too hot and ate slowly. Grandmother also ate slowly like me. I thought of what Mother had said during the day, and I seemed to understand a little. I couldn't help calling out in a sad voice:</p>
<p>"Mother! Mother! Come and eat!"</p>
<p>"I've already eaten!" Mother replied from the kitchen, her throat sounding like it was stuffed with something. "Kui'er! Eat well!" Grandmother said to me gently.</p>
<p>I really couldn't bear it. Why didn't Mother come and eat with us? I put down my bowl and ran to the kitchen. I wanted Mother to come and eat with us. When I ran into the kitchen, Mother was struggling to swallow something, and she hid it as soon as she saw me.</p>
<p>"Mom will come and eat with you soon. I still have something to finish, and then I'll come!"</p>
<p>Mother, with a pained expression, followed me and sat down at the table.</p>
<p>Grandmother still hadn't swallowed her bowl of thin porridge. When she saw Mother, she couldn't hold back her sorrow and shed a few old tears, but Mother remained silent.</p>
<p>I saw that Mother's mouth had many bran-like crumbs on it. My child's heart felt like it had suddenly received a heavy blow, and I immediately started crying. Mother and Grandmother had no idea why I was crying.</p>
<p>After that, I followed Mother at all times, except when I went up the mountain to chop firewood.</p>

<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>Everyone responded together. What a tragic and stirring moment! Then, they shouted a few more moving slogans and moved forward northwards. Haiquan saw a streetcar coming, so he hid behind the streetcar and scattered some leaflets on the Baidu Bridge, shouting slogans with incorrect pronunciation. Later, he just echoed their shouts, yelling "Ah, ah" emptily. He was worried that police officers would come and catch him from the front and back. When he turned his head to look south, he saw Li Yixiang leading a few senior figures from the literary world following from a distance.</p>
<p>They finally crossed the Baidu Bridge. Usually, one could see two Scottish soldiers standing guard there with long guns, but fortunately, they weren't there today. They turned into North Suzhou Road and advanced westward along North Suzhou Road, shouting slogans and scattering leaflets.</p>
<p>"Oh no! This is terrible!"</p>
<p>They were about to approach the Zhapu Road Bridge. Haiquan saw a large group of black hounds coming from the front and back. Haiquan panicked and scattered all the leaflets in his hand into the Suzhou River. He paid attention to the movements of the hounds. Chinese people came forward to snatch their leaflets and banners. Two white officers came over to arrest the young people leading at the front. The Japanese were the most unreasonable, picking up wooden sticks and randomly hitting the legs of these young people. Haiquan circled around and hid at the entrance of a white Russian antique shop. He saw a short Japanese police officer being the most energetic, still waving the wooden stick in his hand and randomly beating a young man. Haiquan felt infinite pain seeing this. Suddenly, he heard a crash, and the Japanese police officer fell onto the road. It turned out that the poisonous beating of Chinese youth by the Japanese hound had angered a Chinese worker who had just walked by on the other side. He picked up the wine bottle in his hand and violently struck the side of the Japanese police officer's head. At that moment, another Japanese police officer fired a shot at the chivalrous worker. The worker fulfilled his glorious end in this way!</p>
<p>Haiquan felt that the loss from this demonstration was too great. Except for him and two other male comrades who escaped unscathed, it could be said that the entire army was wiped out. He felt that this sacrifice was too meaningless.</p>
<p>When he walked to the Seward Road intersection, he encountered a Japanese police officer who came to check his body. The police officer interrogated him in broken Shanghai dialect.</p>
<p>"I am seeing things!"</p>
<p>This was a Japanese sentence he had learned from Mrs. Tsuruko. He made use of it. The Japanese police officer smiled and let him pass.</p>
<p>Sitting in the streetcar, his chest was still pounding very hard. He secretly congratulated himself for having been so quick-witted just now, allowing him to escape the net. Otherwise, he would really be suffering at this moment. But on the other hand, he secretly cursed his own baseness and cowardice. He felt a contradictory pain.</p>

<h3 id="e216">The Gold Market in the Midst of Minor Financial Fluctuations <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>Overseas Silver Market Retracts, Previous Market Slowly Advances</p>
<p>Backwardation Drops in the Afternoon, Turns to Slightly Decline</p>
<p>Current Swap Market, Shorts Post Around Eight Yuan</p>
<p>Although the gold market result yesterday was flat, the front market rose while the back market fell, and the process was unpredictable. In the early morning, due to the foreign telegram from London, the near and far ends both shrunk by 3.125, and the exchange rate did not fluctuate much. The New York silver price suddenly shrank by 3.75, and the far-end silver market on the precious metals exchange also fell by 2.5% to 3.2%. US cotton fell by 5 points, and the private telegram was slightly 18.75. The raw market immediately rose to 90 yuan, with Dadecheng buying in, adding up to 23 yuan, while Hengyu sold out, and the opening was 1091 yuan and 3 jiao. The foreign exchange market opening was also tight, and it improved further after the opening, once rising to 1094 yuan and 2 jiao, and then tending to ease. HSBC's listed prices for British and American currencies did not move, and then it broke to within 90 yuan. The process was still flat. The back market opened relatively stable, and then the swap market opened, which rose and fell accordingly. When the swap market was unfavorable to the longs, the backwardation fell, and the exchange in China was also strong, further retreating to 1081 yuan and 5 jiao. The Bombay telegram reported a drop of 3.3.4 anna, and the banks' appetite was also slightly flat, so the closing still returned to 1086 yuan and 1 jiao. It was found that the city's process was mediocre, and people felt dazed. When the swap was opened, there were a lack of opponents in the market, and slight fluctuations were rapid. Although Chixia increased by 16 yuan, the price to increase by Nian Yuan still had buyers. The backwardation for the April-May swap was 6 yuan, and it was more expensive before the swap. The initial opening was 8 yuan, then rising to more than 9 yuan, but because the longs, such as the Guangbang and Dalianbang groups, were willing to swap out, it retreated to around 7 yuan. In addition, a certain firm's large accumulation of spot goods was suspected of entrusting someone to swap out, and the trend was unstable. The market situation in one day was as follows: The morning opening was 1091 yuan and 3 jiao, which was 5 yuan and 5 jiao higher than the previous close. Goods opened at 1 yuan, and the foreign exchange market opened tightly at 1.25. The recent asking price was estimated at British exchange of 1 shilling and 2 pences and 14.375, American exchange of 20 yuan 5 jiao 6.25. Dadecheng Zhaofengchang sold slightly, and then retreated from 1 yuan and 6 jiao to 0 yuan and 3 jiao. The foreign exchange market was still good. In June, American currency at 8.125 was difficult to settle, Yifeng Yongdaxing Yongjin reached 3 yuan, Zhifeng Yong further reached more than 3 yuan, and July American currency at 9.375 was wanted by Mitsui, Hongli Dadecheng Qingfa Yong all advanced to 4 yuan and 2 jiao, but this price was difficult to obtain. Hengxing sold off its limited holdings, only selling at par, gradually falling. Tongyi also came to sell, falling to within 3 yuan. Magali sold American currency at 5.625 for this month, and Fuchang sold at 2 yuan. American currency at 9.375 for July was difficult to sell, Fuyu Xiexing Yong sold again to around 1 yuan, Hengxing Yuanmao Yong slightly took in, pulling up 1 yuan, but because Yuanheng sold, it retreated to within 1 yuan, and Hengxing suddenly came to sell, so it retreated to 0 yuan and 5 jiao. HSBC's listed prices were announced, and British and American currencies did not change. After this, it was very stable, hovering around 1 yuan for a long time. This was because HSBC took in American currency at 5.625 for this month, which was sold by Hefeng. Tongyi and Fuchang bought a little, and it became more stable. When HSBC took in American currency at 5.625 for this month again, Fuyu and Hengyu competed to buy, reaching 3 yuan and 6 jiao. This was because the banks' appetite seemed strong, Zhongfu took in American currency at 1.25 for August, and Huabi took 0.625 again. After this, the trend gradually showed weakness. Huabi sold off American currency at 5.625 for this month, Yuanheng sold again, reaching within 2 yuan. Although Hengyu advanced, it was still downstream because Hengxing came up to sell. Huabi sold off American currency at 8.125 for June, Yuansheng Yong sold, Futai Hengxiang Feng also sold, reaching 90 yuan, Bingxing advanced a little, pulling up 1 yuan, before Mitsui, etc. came out with American currency at 21 yuan for August, Shengyong came to sell again, Fuyu and Bingxing competed to sell, breaking the 90 yuan mark and falling to 88 yuan. At this time, it was close to closing, and those taking in at low prices were still surging, Tongyi, etc. slightly took in, gradually rising to 90 yuan. In any case, the afternoon closing was 1089 yuan and 5 jiao, and goods were auctioned at 89 yuan.</p>
<p>The back market opening was 1088 yuan and 7 jiao, and goods opened at 8 yuan. Shunli first sold off, falling to 7 yuan and 8 jiao. Fuchang and Dadecheng slightly advanced, gradually pulling up. Qianchangxiang advanced further, reaching more than 9 yuan. Yuankangxiang also came to buy in, and then rose to 90 yuan. Dadecheng came to sell off, to 9 yuan. Mitsui came out with American currency at 75 for May, and retreated to 7 yuan and 6 jiao. Zhifengyong and Bingxing all advanced, reaching 9 yuan and 9 jiao. At this time, the swap market was open. Qingfayong advanced fiercely, so the gold market also retreated from 9 yuan and 9 jiao to 7 yuan and 2 jiao. Before long, the swap market rose, and the banks took in with considerable force, further rising to 9 yuan. After this, it gradually became unsustainable, because Guangbang Hengxing and Dalianbang Shunli all came to swap out, Yiyu and Fuchang competed to sell, reaching within 7 yuan. There was very little trading in the market, and no one paid attention, so it rose and fell with the ups and downs of the swap backwardation. When American currency at 21 yuan for June was not needed, a rise and fall trend began. Yuanmao Yong Yiyu and Fuchang all sold, and then fell to 81 yuan and 5 jiao. The Bombay telegram reported a drop of 3 anna, and Hengxing bought in at 3 yuan and 5 jiao. Although there was a drop of 1 yuan, it was because Citibank took in American currency at 21 yuan for June, and Yuanchun bought a little, reaching around 4 yuan. At this time, the swap market had risen from 7 yuan and 1 jiao to around 9 yuan. Wanxing advanced to 6 yuan, and before long, Richang also bought, and rose again from 5 yuan and 3 jiao to 6 yuan and 6 jiao. Dalianbang and Guangbang still came to swap in, and the swap continued to be cheap. The closing then retreated to 1086 yuan and 1 jiao. There was very little trading after the close, and goods were suddenly and violently bid down to 3 yuan and 5 jiao. It was found that the highest price of the day was 1094 yuan and 2 jiao, and the lowest was 1081 yuan and 5 jiao, with a fluctuation of 12 yuan and 7 jiao. The result was a slight increase of 3 jiao compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The announced price was calculated as 1.0 yuan and 25 because HSBC's listed prices did not change, and the American exchange rate was still calculated as 1.0 yuan and 25. The alloy price was 1185 yuan. According to the closing price, it was approximately pressed down to 99 yuan and some change, which was not much different from the previous close. The registration for this month was 1096 yuan, for May it was 1090 yuan, the morning settlement water was 1093 yuan, and the afternoon settlement water was 1089 yuan.</p>
<p>The public notes (for April) released were 126 notes each from Qianchangxiang Yingfeng and Heng, 115 notes from Dafeng Heng, 70 notes from Ruikang, 14 notes from Dashun, and 7 notes from Yongfeng. The notes taken in were 280 notes from Tongfeng, 77 notes from Runchang Yong, 56 notes from Dadecheng, 42 notes from Runchang Yu, and 7 notes from Zhifeng Yong, totaling 462 notes taken in and released.</p>
<p>The Chixia market was stable. The initial opening was estimated to add 16 yuan, and it was sold to Dafeng Heng by Qianchangxiang in the same industry at par. There was very little trading. Afterwards, Tongfeng Heng raised the price with force, generally in the range of 19 yuan to 20 yuan. The swap (April-May) was only made by Yuanmao Yong to Yongfeng for 21 notes, at a price of 6 yuan. Not many transactions were made. In the current term (May-June), the Dalianbang immediately came to swap in more than 400 notes at the listed price before reaching the specified time, which were swapped out by Yuanxinyong and Cuichang. Later, Huixiang immediately swapped 175 notes to Shunli, for 8 yuan. Then, the groups swapped mutually, with goods Daxingyong Qianchangxiang, etc. all coming to swap out, and Qingfayong Hengyu swapped in, and then increased to 5 yuan and 5 jiao. Hengxing then started to swap in, only obtaining 210 notes swapped out by Qianchangxiang, and the price went downstream. Yuanheng Dalianbang Qingfa Hengyu came to swap out, Daxingyong Zhifengyong Hongli Yuanmao Yong, etc. swapped out, but Qingfa had a large amount of water and a considerable long position, and the swap price stood at more than 8 yuan. The opening was 8 yuan and 2 jiao for the shorts to swap out, Zhifengyong Tongtaichang swapped out, reaching 8 yuan and 5 jiao, but because Hengxing came to swap out the long position fiercely, it gradually retreated to around 7 yuan. Daxingyong Chunyuan Yongdadecheng Yuanmao Yong Fuyu competed to swap out, forming a rise, reaching around 8 yuan, Qianchangxiang Daxingbing Fuyu further swapped to more than 9 yuan. The longs, such as Guangbang Hengxing Dalianbang Wanxing Shunli, all came to swap in, and the downstream was still seen, reaching 8 yuan at 4:30.

Qianchangxiang was originally a long, but suddenly came to swap out. Qingfayong's long position was not huge, but this time he swapped out a lot, or he may have to act on behalf of Tongfengheng, which is not yet known.

American cotton prices fell by five points. The near-term American exchange rate also opened tighter than the previous close by 0.125, calculated at $20.5625. Initially, the trend was quite tight. June U.S. dollars were difficult to settle at 8.125, and July dollars at 9.375 were sought by Mitsui with great eagerness. However, after a short while, the situation gradually changed and became more relaxed. HSBC's listing for both English and American exchanges remained unchanged, also having an impact. Subsequently, the situation became peaceful, with the competition fluctuating between buying and selling prices. The market hardened slightly before noon closing, with banks showing a decreasing appetite. There were not many transactions in the afternoon, but banks were more inclined to buy in. Although there was a brief hardening, they were still willing to buy in. It was reported that Bombay fell by 2.3.4 annas, which coincided with the hardening trend. The banks' willingness was still stable.

The interbank lending rate was white in both the morning and afternoon markets, while the exchange rate for foreign currency head-shaving rose sharply, reaching a maximum of two dimes.

<h3 id="e220">Securities and Public Bonds Slightly Weakened <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Transactions Mostly Involved Multiple Short Covering —</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market on the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange was relatively active, with major players also making some moves. However, trading was still not very brisk. At the opening in the morning, northern firms and retail investors were selling, and market prices fell by one or two dimes to over four dimes. In the second round of trading, there was some demand for #38, and all the listed varieties rebounded by one or two dimes. The 20-roll futures started to rise, but #11 and northern firms were selling, so the subsequent varieties remained stable and fell back by one or two dimes. In the afternoon, there were rumors in the market, and selling of #54 was quite strong, with multiple short covering. At the same time, there was some demand for #16, #38, and #50. However, due to the disparity between buyers and sellers, market prices continued to fall by one or two dimes across the board, with some falling by as much as five or six dimes, creating a rather uncertain situation. There was no turnaround at the close, and retail investors with multiple long positions were mostly closing out their positions, mostly at a loss of two or three dimes. Among them, #16 and #17 saw some buying, but buyers were unwilling to increase prices, knowing that there was still selling of #54. Throughout the day, the most sold was #54, and the most bought were #16, #17, and #47. Buying and selling were mostly driven by multiple short covering. Regarding the prospects for public bonds, barring any special changes in the political situation, there should not be a drastic decline. As a result of the market, prices continued to decline by small amounts, ranging from two or three dimes to six or seven dimes, except for the May issue, which fell by as much as one dollar. The total trading volume was higher than before, totaling $6,633,000, including $3,000 in spot transactions and $6,630,000 in futures transactions. Among these, only salt tax and troop reduction each accounted for over one million, consolidated tax only accounted for 940,000, and the rest ranged from tens of thousands to six or seven hundred thousand.</p>

<p>According to a report from the New Fung Foreign Firm, the New York stock market on Wednesday (the 12th) was relatively weak despite generally positive news. It was also affected by the decline in grain prices, resulting in very quiet trading. The total trading volume for the day was 750,000 shares. According to reliable sources, tire prices are about to increase, so the prospects for rubber prices are more optimistic. Furthermore, this week's steel output increased by 3% to 19.5%, due to improvements in the automobile industry and high demand for tinplate for manufacturing cans and beer barrels. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>

<p>The yarn market is weakening, and another wave of price declines has begun. Current yarn consumption is too stagnant, and various groups are still showing no signs of activity. As for the factories, although they are facing difficulties, they have substantial inventories. Speculators are still focused on short selling, putting even more pressure on the market. Future developments will depend on actual demand.</p>

<p>The opening market for man-made fiber was slightly weak, with average cotton and stagnant current yarn sales. Prices for various months fell by $4.60. The afternoon opening saw sluggish actual sales, and selling pressure increased again. Closing prices saw major players selling off, and the downward trend was even more pronounced. Prices for various months fell by $8.90 to $1.10. Total trading volume for the day was 24,400 bales. It was found that Chun Kee sold 950 bales, Geng Fung 1,150 bales, Ming De 650 bales, and Xin Cheng 1,350 bales.

<p>The turnover of current yarn was quite stagnant. It was found that the total number of bales purchased by various groups throughout the day was 298, with prices falling by 5 dimes. The purchase amounts of various groups are as follows:</p>
<p>Sichuan 70 Xiamen 5 Guangdong 110 Mainland 14</p>
<p>Ningbo 14 Peers 35 Changsha 10 Weihaiwei 40</p>
<p>The flower market is gradually weakening, and the situation is relatively uncertain. With average cotton prices and the yarn market struggling to recover, factories have decided to reduce working hours, which will reduce future consumption. Therefore, manufacturers have less need for current cotton. However, general speculators are not releasing the amount they have absorbed due to the calm cotton prices. However, if American cotton prices rise, exchange rates will loosen, and the silver market calculations will be less relevant.</p>

<p>— Foreign Rice Sales Were Mainly Domestic —</p>
<p>Yesterday, 200 bags of old Saigon foreign rice were sold, with the price remaining at $8. Although the quality of newly arrived Saigon rice was new, the grains were too broken and of inferior appearance, with more than 5% broken rice compared to ordinary Saigon No. 1 rice. Therefore, buyers offered lower prices than old Saigon, bidding around $7.89, while sellers were demanding prices above $8.10 due to high costs, making it difficult to reach an agreement. Hunan Xian rice continued to be sold in Fujian, and the late-season Jiangxi rice was actively selling at a price increase of 5 cents. However, after the arrival of new Hunan red rice, inventory gradually increased, and sales became stagnant. Yesterday, among the 183 bags of Zhongguan rice offered, the price was slightly lower, also falling below the $8 mark. Ordinary early-season Jiangxi rice was selling at a price of $6.60 for 137 bags. Furthermore, 1,600 bags of late-season rice were sold at prices ranging from $8.20 to 0.05 for the top grade, $8 to $7.95 for the middle grade, and $7.65 for the lower grade. Zhongguan Hunan red rice was selling at $7.95. Foreign rice was mainly sold domestically, while the rest was sold in Fujian.</p>

Apr/Jul down .01 each, and other months slightly smaller decrease. Aside from news of decline in foreign wheat prices, long positions closing out, as well as factory short covering, but actual sales were quite active. Aside from cash withdrawal, there has also been near term purchasing which has caused prices to be high and low. In the afternoon the near term selling was very good, but the market was at equilibrium, and the next month saw a slight improvement. Far-term months were weighed down by foreign wheat. No one was selling Sept. which resulted in a balance. The final closing price had current month unchanged, next month up .01, Jun down 0.025, Jul down .075, Aug down .005, Sept unchanged.</p>

<p>Bean cake sales were poor due to unfavorable weather, resulting in no large movement from various regions. Recently, Guang group purchased Three Star Brand which stabilized the factory prices, there were few inquiries which led to a price decline overall.

<p>The city's foreign tea businesses will also begin adopting the Yuan for pricing and trade. Canton/Guangdong's Chinese Tea company implemented it first.

Now, the market for foreign silk has been on a decline, and both silk and cocoon firms have seen bankruptcy. Shanghai has a total of 113 silk factories, but only 9 are operating normally. Lending in the financial sector is now more limited, so silk merchants are not prepared to purchase spring cocoons. Few Hangzhou and Shaoxing cocoon firms have been rented out. Hangzhou, Linping, Pingyao, Gongbu, and Xiaoshan, Zhuji, Xinchang, Chang’an, Haining have been rented by local firms like Qiahe, Xinchang, Baishifu, Baotai, Tongyi, Fushen, Tianlai, Dalai, Junshengfu, Yuanfeng, Renji, Fengtai, but the total does not exceed 30%.

<h3 id="e236">Many Emperors in Jinan <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Zhi</p>
<p>A recent news report about the busting of someone claiming to be emperor in Jinan was quite hilarious. The gist is: Wang, an unemployed vagrant, deemed himself quite remarkable and had "emperor" thoughts. In February, he discovered a supposed "dragon robe" in his courtyard and thought it was heaven's will, thus following heaven's mandate and enthroning himself, using insane ramblings to mislead the public, gathering hundreds of believers, and dispatching two so-called "military advisors" to acquire all sorts of instruments in preparation for an auspicious enthronement day. County Magistrate Fan and a certain regiment commander stationed in the area were alerted to this, so this "quasi-emperor" who hadn't even sat on the dragon throne got to experience the taste of iron bars.</p>
<p>This matter is slightly similar to the demon bandit case in Jinan this past December of someone self-proclaimed "Three Emperors." But the ringleader of the "Three Emperors" case, the fake "Heavenly Emperor" Li Lecuan, was able to have the "Imperial Concubine" flatter, so now he has his freedom. Wang is now in the military tribunal awaiting trial, it's unknown how he will be sentenced, but I suspect Wang could copy the "Imperial Concubine" Li's tactic of sweetly saying "Lord Fan will approve my application" "I will secure your throne" "Please release my Great Royal Eight" and that will elicit "boisterous laughter," confiscate the "dragon robe and instruments" and show "deep sympathy for his nerves being stimulated", and return our "quasi-emperor" Wang with freedom.</p>
<p>Though these comical events stem from ignorance, they are indeed "worthy of deep sympathy," but there are many subtle clues that make one suspect that the enemy is planning trouble behind the scenes! Look, Li Lecuan's confession stated that "Xuantong sent someone to connect and promised Japan would provide guns and cannons," and where did this "dragon robe" come from? Was it really a "heavenly" gift? Even if it was a "neighbor's prank," where did the neighbor get this "dragon robe"? In my imagination, this "dragon robe" must be studded with pearls and treasures, at least it should be a "red satin" with "gold thread Xiang embroidery" like the grand robes worn by fake emperors on the stage. Who would be willing to spend so much on a "prank"? If it was a "neighbor's prank," where did these hundreds of believers come from? ... Investigating layer by layer, do we treat this as a simple case of "severely stimulated nerves" and give it "special sympathy"? Or do we faintly see a huge hand pulling the strings behind this puppet?</p>

<p>Young Marshal Zhang boarded a ship to Italy the other night, and he took his summer palace paintings and calligraphies. Government officials accompanied him to the pier to send him off. I was moved to pen a few lines in his honor:</p>
<p>The young marshal has a good time.</p>
<p>With butterflies and mandarin ducks by his side.</p>
<p>He packs up the forbidden city treasures,</p>
<p>Set sail to Europe at his side.</p>
<p>There were no bells of war,</p>
<p>So he abandoned the country for peace.</p>
<p>He takes with him ashes,</p>
<p>To bury the ones he may find abroad.</p>
<p>The flowers are the same as home,</p>
<p>But the clouds and rain over here are a bit strange.</p>
<p>Who can tell me if being an outsider feels like here,</p>
<p>If there are any girls for him at the clubs.</p>
<p>He has led the world astray in his time,</p>
<p>But even now the old men are afraid of his wrath.</p>
<p>Shouldering the weight of the past,</p>
<p>In Italy he'll have more than enough.</p>
<p>His complexion looks pale,</p>
<p>His body covered in scars.</p>
<p>If you ask him what happened to him,</p>
<p>He'll say it was a rainy day.</p>
<h3 id="e238">Another Shortcut to Converting Tael to Yuan <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>I was inspired by Mr. Ouyang's "715 Shortcut for Converting Tael to Yuan" chart in the April 6th issue. The calculation method is ingenious and admirable! However, it is my humble opinion that this type of formula, similar to the return of a pearl, is difficult to remember without thorough study. Moreover, the calculation involves too many digits, making it inconvenient to apply, and still feels somewhat lacking. Based on my research, I have derived another shortcut, briefly described below for readers' study.</p>
<p>Shortcut: Multiply the number of taels you want to convert to silver dollars by 1.4 to get a product (the number of silver dollars). Then, subtract one-thousandth of this product (that is, the number obtained by moving the decimal point of the product three places to the left) from this product to get the desired number of silver dollars. For example, to convert 367 taels of standard silver to silver dollars using the legal rate of 715, the formula is as follows:</p>
<p>367 × 1.4 = 513.88 yuan</p>
<p>513.80 yuan - 0.5138 yuan = 513.2862 yuan</p>
<p>According to comparisons, the result obtained using this shortcut differs from the result obtained by dividing the number of taels by the legal rate by no more than a few cents when converting to hundreds of silver dollars, and no more than a few tenths of a cent when converting to tens of thousands of silver dollars. I have tested it many times and found it to be consistently accurate. However, it should be noted that when applying this method, the legal rate of 715 must be used, otherwise the multiplier should change accordingly. I will not elaborate on the mathematical principles involved in this method due to limited space in this publication.</p>

<p>— Ping</p>
<p>Returning from the Typesetting Room</p>
<p>Some have written much about Shanghai Night Talks, saying the nights in Shanghai are a paradise above hell. I think Shanghai Morning Talks are equally worth writing about because the mornings in Shanghai are a hell within paradise. When the pleasure-seekers end their nightlife, the working class—at least the producers—begin their efforts. Let's start with our work because there are quite a few people in Shanghai who depend on it for a living.</p>
<p>The manager posted a notice in the editor's office glass cabinet stating that the newspaper would change its typesetting style starting tomorrow. As a result, all the talents in our editorial office personally went to the typesetting room. Usually, local news, financial columns, and supplements are sent to the typesetting workers for typesetting in advance. Today, after receiving a call from the manager, none of the proofs were put on the racks after proofreading. When we finished editing the telegrams and arrived at the typesetting room, it was already past one o'clock. Everyone yawned while typesetting, not caring whether it looked better than the previous style. When the work was completed, it was almost dawn the next day.</p>
<p>"Damn it, isn't the circulation good? Why change the damn style!" Little Chen adjusted his wide-framed glasses on his nose, muttering to himself as he stepped out of the typesetting room. Old He, nicknamed "Pretty Boy," had snowflakes and sweat frozen together on his face, constantly wiping it with a handkerchief.</p>
<p>"Little Chen, isn't that appointment at the Carlton again early tomorrow (today)? Getting a raise is always like pulling silk from a cocoon. A good newspaper still has to come up with this and that. He sleeps with his mistress while making others stay up all night!" Old He continued to grumble.</p>
<p>Looking around, there wasn't a single rickshaw in sight, unsure if it was the shift change. We had no choice but to move forward with heavy steps.</p>
<p>"Old He, any romantic encounters?"</p>
<p>Old He didn't answer. The sky was just beginning to lighten, and the streetlights had lost their glow. Three long shadows lay across the road, moving gently forward, like a ghostly, gloomy hell.</p>
<p>After dragging ourselves across two streets, we discovered a new continent—several rickshaws were coming towards us with their poles. The three of us jumped into the rickshaws in unison, touched our hat brims, and nodded. The rickshaw pullers took off running.</p>
<p>Sitting in the rickshaw, my eyelids felt even heavier, so I closed my eyes drowsily. Feeling the rickshaw rolling on the asphalt road was exceptionally comfortable.</p>
<p>As if in a dream, I suddenly heard urgent footsteps chasing from behind. I thought, "Winter has passed smoothly, wouldn't it be a laughingstock to run into a pig-slaughtering scene in spring?" My heart pounded, completely dispelling my sleepiness. I listened intently as the sound approached from behind. I pressed hard on the footboard, and the rickshaw puller, taken aback by the sudden force, turned his head and asked, "Isn't it the Route de Saipo?" He thought he had taken the wrong route. I couldn't tell him the reason for pressing the footboard and angrily said, "Pull faster!" But in the midst of the question and answer, the rickshaw behind had already caught up to mine. The rickshaw puller's torn shoes hit the asphalt road, making a sound like horses' hooves. I turned my head, secretly laughing at my misunderstanding. The passenger in the other rickshaw was smiling at me—a protagonist from Shanghai Night Talks, a Dancing Girl. My rickshaw puller, after being overtaken, muttered, "Little Sanzi, come on!" They pulled the rickshaws like a race, and the dancing girl laughed, shaking in the rickshaw.</p>
<p>"Where's the dance hall?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Great Eastern."</p>
<p>Her rickshaw slowly moved ahead, and the rickshaw puller triumphantly shouted, "Little Liuzi, come on!"</p>
<p>She turned her head, raised her Xiangling leather suitcase, and waved to me, signaling goodbye.</p>
<p>I saw her permed hair disappear as the sun was about to rise.</p>
<h3 id="e240">Studying While Defecating <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Ziyang</p>
<p>Nowadays, people often say that Chinese students are too lazy and unwilling to study hard. During class, they are either dozing off or telling jokes, so even university students have poor language skills. Where can China find talent?</p>
<p>These words are indeed true, but I often see students holding a book in their hands while defecating, reading without looking away. This diligent appearance is truly admirable. Therefore, I urge the school authorities to quickly reward defecation. The more one defecates, the more credits one receives. If someone defecates all day long, then he must be "reluctant to put down the book." If Mr. Teng Hong saw this, he would probably praise, "Hui is indeed studious." In this way, the school will be full of diligent students, and there will be no worry about a lack of talent in China. However, it's important not to tear up the toilet paper (In support of the righteous army).</p>
<p>Clerk's Correspondence</p>
<h3 id="e241">A Friend of My Wife <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I currently have a very difficult problem to solve. If you could give me a satisfactory answer in your Clerk's Correspondence column, I would be truly grateful. The facts are as follows: I am twenty-eight years old and work as a clerk in a foreign company. Last autumn, I married a Miss Huang. Before we got married, I met her closest sister, Miss Yang, through her introduction. Later, we met several times at Miss Huang's house, but we only nodded in greeting. Since we got married, Miss Yang has often visited my wife, so I have become more familiar with her than before. As time flowed by, she has now shown me a very affectionate attitude and often asks me to go out to the park or see movies with her. Because I couldn't refuse out of politeness, I went to see a movie with her once. But my wife doesn't know about this. If my wife found out, wouldn't she become jealous? But if I break off with Miss Yang, I would feel sorry for her. I am now in a dilemma. I earnestly</p>
<p>ask you for a satisfactory solution. Wishing you</p>
<p>Spiritual Happiness Chen Yingqiu</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Mr. Chen is a married man. If he pursues love with his wife's friend, Miss Yang, even though she certainly already knows that you are a married man and you have not deceived her, it may not be entirely unjustifiable legally or morally. However, since she is very affectionate towards you, you should consider her feelings and prevent her from regretting it later. Therefore, you should find a way to avoid this entanglement</p>
<p>Completely wash away humiliation, and fill the heroic Manchurian state.</p>
<p>, that is really the right thing to do. However, if you reject her directly and frankly, it may leave too deep a wound in her heart, and it may not be very appropriate. Based on our inference, Mr. Chen must be an understanding and interesting man—hiding it from his wife and going to see a movie with her—so he was able to win Miss Yang's deep affection. Understanding this, Mr. Chen's problem will be solved easily. You might as well pretend to be an insensitive fool. When she asks you out, ask her to invite your wife to go with you. This way, on the one hand, you can show that you and your wife have a deep affection, making her feel that there is no opportunity. On the other hand, with such a bodyguard wife, there is nothing to fear. Seeing your actions, she will naturally gradually cool down her feelings. Finally, we believe that if there are other promising young men among Mr. Chen's friends who are still seeking a partner, Mr. Chen might as well introduce them. In short, she wants secrecy, but you must be open. This is the clever way to deal with this problem that we have come up with.</p>

<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Ms. Liu didn't forbid him, but she set three rules. First, no drinking during the day; second, no going to bars; and third, only high-quality brandy was allowed. Wu Yi fully accepted the second and third rules because the location and choice of alcohol wouldn't affect the principle of drinking, so there was no need to haggle over it. However, the first rule—no drinking during the day—was truly impossible to obey. Yet, he couldn't openly object, so he had to imitate the provincial chairmen's attitude towards central government decrees, outwardly compliant but inwardly defiant. Knowing that Ms. Liu wouldn't come to the school, he bought as much brandy as possible and hid it in the lounge, drinking freely at any time. Fortunately, he drank from a glass, so his colleagues thought he was drinking tea, and no one paid attention. They let him get drunk, lie down at his desk for a nap, and drift off into a dream, unaware that the east had already darkened.</p>
<p>Drinking, sleeping... good times passed by in a dream-like life, gradually transforming a lively and excited Dr. Wu into a silent and tranquil middle-aged man. His former colleagues were all taking advantage of their positions as professors at political schools to advance their careers and make a fortune, each displaying their abilities. Only Wu Yi still held his brandy bottle, guarding his old position for more than ten years. But even a dull person has dull luck. Because he was able to be so content and patient, he was noticed by a newly appointed Minister of Education, who thought that he wanted to find a puppet who was both experienced and could be controlled, and only Dr. Wu was the right person. So he exceptionally appreciated him and appointed him as the president of National University XX.</p>
<p>After the appointment letter arrived, Wu Yi had to reluctantly abandon the desk at which he had been drinking and napping almost every day for more than ten years and step into the president's office of University XX to begin his new life of changing the soup but not the medicine.</p>
<p>Although most university presidents do not teach classes, in principle, they should be responsible for everything and would not be so idle. However, Wu Yi was a puppet that Minister XX had deliberately created. The hiring of professors was handled by Minister XX's cousin—the head of the professorate—and the economic management was the sole responsibility of Minister XX's brother-in-law—the director of administrative affairs. Wu Yi was just a symbolic leader, so other than signing and sealing documents, he had virtually nothing to do.</p>

<h3 id="e243">The First Movies Imported into China <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Fei Wo</p>
<p>Thirty coppers to watch a show on Fourth Horse Road</p>
<p>In recent years, the film industry in China has been developing rapidly day by day. The public's interest in movies is also growing stronger every day. Tracing back through history, foreign movies were imported into China roughly in three stages: the first stage was Hong Kong, the second stage was Shanghai, and the third stage was the cities of Beijing, Tianjin, Hankou…and inland areas. The first import to Shanghai was about thirty years ago. A foreigner with light blue glasses suddenly came to Shanghai, carrying a half-old movie machine. He also hired several red-headed Indians to beat drums and play western horns, making a great commotion every day at the Shenping Teahouse on Fourth Horse Road. At that time, Shanghai was not yet very prosperous, and only a small number of Westerners were doing business in Shanghai. Shanghai people were very curious when they suddenly saw this foreigner. But the old gentleman set up a white bamboo cloth on his table, twisted the machine (still using dry batteries), and as if by magic, mountains and rivers, figures, and dark shadows all appeared one after another on the white cloth. The people who gathered to watch were all dumbfounded, thinking it was the newly arrived "Western mirror," but they couldn't guess what was being sold in the gourd. This was the initial spark for the import of movies into China.</p>
<p>Slowly, people learned the name of the foreigner. He was from Spain and was called Soma. He was also the first person to establish a movie theater in Shanghai. He first came to Shanghai around 1903. At that time, it cost thirty coppers to watch his "Western mirror" movie, and you could only watch it once. If you wanted to watch it again, you had to pay again. People who paid thirty coppers to watch his movies still talk about it with great enthusiasm. Later, because his business was thriving, he opened a movie theater on Zhabei Road, which is now the Hongkou Grand Theater. This was the first movie theater to appear in Shanghai.</p>
<p>In recent years, the film industry in Shanghai has developed as fast as electricity. Advertisements for movie theater openings can be seen almost everywhere on the streets. Talking about prices, it originally cost thirty coppers, but now it costs at least twenty cents to see a movie, and up to three or four yuan. Compared to then, it's a world apart! I wonder what these moviegoers think about it?</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3 id="e244">Review of "A Woman's Shout" <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Indeed, at a time when dark forces permeate all of China, the cries for "women's liberation" should rise to the sky and stir up a great wave of anger. Their suffering, their struggles, undoubtedly, they must use their own strength to open up a bright path.</p>
<p>Then, "A Woman's Shout" is a work that has been stirred up in this upsurge. If it can truly represent this liberation movement, even taking on the task of guidance, then it is definitely what Chinese audiences desperately need.</p>
<p>But what does the screenwriter and director Shen Xiling tell us in this film? Ye Lian, from the owning class, suffered from the sacrifices of the "civil war," returned to the countryside, and was robbed by bandits. She had no choice but to escape to the city with her weak sister. In the city, in the factory, she suffered "double oppression" and cried in pain, and also engaged in a powerless struggle. As a result, she woke up from the delusion of love and realized that "personal struggle" was not enough. Then, the subtitles tell us that she should be awakened.</p>
<p>True, in theory, all this is quite correct, and it can also be regarded as an analysis of the complex relations and forms of real society. But according to the evolution of the plot, the protagonist Ye Lian should be a fairly conscious young woman with a strong will in the first part. Later, she should be a resolute resister, and should seek proper steps for liberation. At the same time, since she has been enlightened by the prescient Shao Ying, with her understanding, she would never be so naive as to repeatedly accept the deception and deception of the potluck boss. Here, the script itself is inevitably lacking. As mentioned above, Ye Lian, in Mr. Shen's ideal, has conversely become a very timid woman. She only cries, only grieves, and in the end, she has not "shouted" anything at all. It is only a tragedy that exposes evil forces. Although the play expresses dissatisfaction with evil forces, it is ultimately a powerless elegy.</p>
<p>As for the performance techniques, it is generally passable. Although the handling and editing of the shots are not good, things like birdcages, candles, and cigars are clever. Of course, the whole thing is not particularly brilliant, but because it is her debut work, we don't need to expect too much.</p>
<p>The protagonist, Wang Ying, because of the director's improper command, and because it was also her first time on camera, of course, the performance will not make us very satisfied.</p>
<p>Other aspects, such as scenery and lighting, are not bad. There are a few actors who are too much, too civilized drama-like. In short, we are not completely satisfied with this play, but we have high hopes for the authors of this film. Work hard! Move forward with big strides!</p>

<p>— Yi Wen</p>
<p>The play itself: with such a golden world, a society, it will naturally produce such a work. Is a woman just a "red flower vase?"</p>
<p>A noble baron will naturally be pursued by many women. At the same time, he does have the qualifications to play with women. I hope that women who have watched this film will be aware of it.</p>
<p>The whole play can be said to be entirely dialogue. If you close your eyes, you can listen to it as a Radio Drama. Perhaps it is the use of theatrical elements that is too excessive? The special techniques of film have become auxiliary.</p>
<p>Actors: Marlene Dietrich does have a suitable performance, especially the steps from country girl to simple socialite to modern socialite, from ugly to beautiful, which is very appealing to the audience. This can also be said to be the power of the director.</p>
<p>Warren William is also a worthy wealthy entrepreneur. Director: In addition to the above-mentioned closeness to stage plays, this can only be said to be bad in the script the division of scenes and shots is very economical and smooth. However, one of the baron's mistresses is always in the bathtub every time she calls the baron. It is too much. There are many ways to describe this type of woman. Why not change a few ways? Light and photography techniques: This is worth praising, especially the re-shoot in the first few episodes.</p>
<p>After watching: I feel that it is just a scene of play in a golden world. I hope that Chinese women can reflect more deeply after watching it. Are you willing to be a "red flower vase?" Then you will lose your soul.</p>

<p>— Ai Yun</p>
<p>Yue Ming Company used to make a fuss about heroes or burning, but this time it has clearly changed its style.</p>
<p>Its story is entirely in the style of old novels, telling the love story of a young couple, but a warlord's son takes a fancy to the girl and plots to frame the man, threatening the girl to marry him. After the girl agrees to marry him, the young warlord spares the young man's death sentence and changes it to imprisonment. Unexpectedly, on the day of the wedding, the young man escapes from prison, comes and beats the warlord to a pulp, and takes the girl away. The warlord's side is about to send people to hunt them down, but suddenly, the revolution succeeds, the warlord loses power, and the lovers become married. This kind of story can be said to only suit people with ordinary low tastes.</p>
<p>Director Ren Pengnian is a very promising person, but unfortunately, he is limited by the environment, so he has achieved nothing. He also serves as a screenwriter, but it can only be said that he barely fulfills his responsibilities. The interweaving is not good. Many forced slapstick jokes can also elicit laughter from country women or children. The two "fight scenes" are even more vulgar.</p>
<p>The protagonist Wu Lizhu is extremely famous in martial arts films. But it is really difficult for her to act in this play. The male lead Luo Keming is the only young man used by many small companies. His performance is still watchable, but at most, he is the tallest among the dwarfs. I won't talk about the rest.</p>
<p>The photography is very immature. How can I describe the light? It is completely sunlight, but there is very little light from the reflectors. The exterior scenes are okay. But the shots are too poor. The interior scenes are simple, and it can be seen at a glance that they are fake scenes. There are too many subtitles, and they are either too literary or too vulgar.</p>
<p>In terms of the story, performance, and narration, there are many irrational and disconnected places. But I will not discuss them one by one.</p>
<p>As for the film itself, I say it is below the horizontal line. But its trend is not bad, which is not commonly seen in small companies. So I hope the small companies will work hard!</p>
<h3 id="e247">Review of Lotus's Eloquent Tongue <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Nan</p>
<p>Introduction This is a film produced by RKO Pictures, originally named Ladies of the Jury, which was released yesterday at the Nanjing Grand Theater. It is only 7,000 feet long, and the details are as follows:</p>
<p>Story A woman is suspected of murdering her husband. Fortunately, a female juror is a friend of this woman and knows that she has been wronged. So, she uses her lotus-like eloquent tongue to persuade the other jurors with her words. She also hires a detective under a false name. In order to understand the truth, those jurors go to the home of the murdered person to find out what happened. Inadvertently, they discover a man hidden there—the maid's lover. They take the maid and the man to court, and the innocent woman is finally acquitted.</p>
<p>Plot It can only be considered an ordinary film. It is a purely American slapstick film, and it is not interesting to the Chinese. However, I personally see that the jurors personally investigate the case, which clearly shows the protection of civil rights in the United States. There is also the more fair succession of "Anglo-American law" and "jury system."</p>
<p>Director This film could have been shot just as well without a director. Only some interweaving shows the director's skills.</p>
<p>Performance Nothing special. Each actor takes it as a prerequisite to make people laugh. Although there are many commendable slapstick actions, there is nothing to talk about in terms of expression. There is no distinction between hosts and guests in it. The whole film is made up of fragmented close-ups, so the 18 or 19 characters have equal opportunities to perform, which can generally be said to be good.</p>
<p>Others The photography is very ordinary, but it has broken close-ups. The editing is very vivid, and it must be said that the screenwriter is doing a good job. The light is very soft. In terms of scenery, there is only one scene of a car running on the road outside, so there is nothing to say. There are only four rooms inside the court, the jury meeting room, the hotel, and the murdered person's room so simple, which is not found in any American feature film. The pronunciation is very clear.</p>
<p>Personal criticism I can only admit that it is a work below the horizontal line. There are countless unreasonable places in it. It describes an American court as being completely without order. Each actor understands that this is a battle, so what artistic meaning can be said?</p>
<p>Copies The first newsreel is not bad. The second slapstick short film, although it is chaotic, is very humorous and can make people happy.</p>

<p>— Ao Xiang</p>

<p>Hollywood romantic films almost always follow a formula. Boy meets girl, they instantly fall in love, their hearts become entwined; there are no conditions, no necessary cause and effect. After falling in love, there will inevitably be a break-up (either the man or the woman), and after the break-up, they will definitely find another lover and immediately succeed in love again. Then, a Kiss End, and all ends happily. These formulas only differ in minor details. "Laughter in Hell" is also a romantic film produced under this formula.</p>
<p>The story goes like this: Brennan is a young miner, and his mother, while alive, hoped he would become an engineer. Through his father's benevolent cultivation, he soon "achieved his wish." At this point, Brennan's romantic life begins. He falls in love with a girl named Belle, and they get married. However, after the marriage, Belle suddenly changes her heart and has an affair with Brennan's friend Grove. Brennan discovers this secret, and in a fit of anger, he kills them, and is imprisoned. The prison guard happens to be Grove's brother, so Brennan suffers greatly. Eventually, he escapes and seeks refuge in the home of a farm girl, and he immediately falls in love with that farm girl. They drive off in a horse-drawn carriage, supposedly to "create a new life together."</p>
<p>Such a story clearly tells the audience something. We really dare not believe that the so-called love in this film is real, especially the love after Brennan escapes from prison, which seems to have fallen from the sky. Why would that farm girl suddenly love a down-and-out prisoner? If it's said to be sympathy, isn't that farm girl even more humanitarian than the Virgin Mary?</p>
<p>The director's technique is quite successful. The entire film's atmosphere is made very tense, and the choice of background and the mood of the plot are also very harmonious. The actor who plays Brennan, Pat O'Brien, is naturally the most successful. The others are also quite competent. The constant kissing in the film can be said to be a "feature." The depiction of the abuse of prisoners in the jail is vivid. Here, we see a dark side of the so-called "American Land of the Free!"</p>
<h3 id="e249">The Film Novel Y慾 Tarakanova (2) <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Mei Hua</p>
<p>Gypsy girls, originally drifting from east to west without a fixed place, naturally do not know their own origins. Xiao Falov said to her very modestly, "I am a count, and I know very well that you are the daughter of Queen Elizabeth. You were driven out by Catherine since you were young. Now, the people of Russia, who doesn't hope you will return? I am someone who has received great favor from Queen Elizabeth, I must help you succeed!"</p>
<p>This Gypsy girl, her blood filled with jumping and joy, she fantasized about the happiness of the future, fantasized about herself becoming Catherine's replacement. Therefore, she agreed, she agreed to everything Xiao Falov arranged.</p>
<p>On the light blue Italian coast, Xiao Falov arranged a magnificent palace for this Gypsy girl, no, she is now Princess Tarakanova (this is Princess Bossetti's real name, people in the world know Tarakanova, but do not know Bossetti). Surrounded by countless warriors and countless palace maids, Princess Tarakanova carried out her enthronement ceremony. The residents of Ragusa were deeply interested in this beautiful foreign princess, and they also held grand carnivals like crazy, holding extremely lively picnics, making a princess transformed from a vagrant girl as happy as if she were falling into a beautiful dream! Especially proud was Xiao Falov, his plan to overthrow Catherine had already achieved half, and when all aspects of the connection were mature, he could launch a large-scale attack on Catherine. This news spread to Russia, spread to Catherine's ears, causing an unusual rage. She decided to trick Princess Tarakanova over before she succeeded. Generals Gray and Orlov accepted Catherine's secret order, boarded a white warship, and went to lure Princess Tarakanova.</p>
<p>On the light blue sea, a beautiful palace floated up, Princess Tarakanova was having a pink dream; the people were celebrating and rejoicing as if drunk: "Beautiful, beautiful princess, you are the one we admire." (To be continued)</p>
