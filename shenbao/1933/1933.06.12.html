<h3 id="c22">世界經濟會議開幕實 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>今日全世界主要國家。無論爲敵爲友。皆派遣其第一流政治家率同專門委員。五十餘國代表。共計二千餘人。躬赴英倫。在英王主領之下。舉行世界經濟會議開幕禮。此次會議。胚胎於去年六月之洛桑會議。該會議之主旨。在乎解决戰債及對德賠欵。其結果賠欵僅以互讓關係。用歐洲復興之名德國支出三十億馬克。暫吿一段落。但附解决戰債之條件。旋以美國堅持戰債賠欵不同之論。又値美國大選在即。致洛桑協定中關於對美戰債交涉。未能正式解决。法意兩國。本有今年三月將與美改訂戰債之說。以美國金融風潮陡起。影響全世界。此議遂中斷。英相麥唐納爲打開世界經濟難局計。渡美與羅斯福氏面商。法國亦派前國務總理赫理歐赴美接洽。其他中德日等九國。亦被邀請派代表。與美總統商世界經濟問題。是爲世界經濟會議之先聲。亦可謂爲國際間在會議之前。一種豫先諒解之運動也。</p>
<p>至於會議時之議題。依一九三二年七月十五日洛桑會議之决案約可分爲兩部。第一爲財政問題。此中包含貨幣及信用政策排除本位貨幣在匯兌上之困難。物價水準及資本之移動等。第二爲經濟問題。包含改善生產與交換之種種條件。尤注意於關稅政策。輸出入之禁止。制限。與商業上其他障害。及生產者之協定。會議開幕之後。此種議案。是否將有變更。尚難豫料。如依華盛頓爐邊談話情勢觀察。即使節目略有更動。大體則不致發生巨在差異。而英美法德意等各主要國家。雖各有其不同之觀點。各持自國之利害。但皆熱望能商得一共通之點。以圖世界經濟恐慌之回復。則爲勢所必然者也。</p>
<p>一九三一年九月。英國脫離金本位制度後。世界各國相繼禁止現金輸出而脫離金本位制。即號金圓國之北美合衆國。亦於今年三月停止金本位。於是國際通貨。頓呈混亂景象。在事實上現世界之金融狀况。已明白現出戰時經濟狀態。各國緊迫如一轍。世界經濟會議之任務。自必集合多數廢棄金本位國家與極少數維持金本位國家。共同參酌。如何恢復金本位制。設使金本位制不能恢復。則至少須令國際匯兌。重上安定之途。使國際間經濟關係回復常態。使現金能自由流通。對外資本可自由移動。再則因生銀喪失其貴金屬價値。致用銀國家之貿易。大見低落反映於世界貿易甚大。至採用複本位制。雖有問題。但提高銀價。亦爲圖通貨安定之一要着。惟此種計劃之實行力何如。猶非僅重行分配現金所能奏效。而當世各國之借貸關係。金融之流動。貿易之週轉。均爲其最先决條件也。</p>
<p>現在資本主義國際間借貸關係。短期債欵。諸多凍結。長期外債。即利息之支付。亦多困難。今若欲回復國際上財政的信用。使國際信用再復以前之流通常態。則最要條件。必如英美法各國之意。須使關係各國經濟組織安全。匯兌制限撤廢。固定化之資源活潑流通。而後乃有希望。</p>
<p>乘此世界各國會商經濟問題之際。提高物價。爲資本主義國家同具之心理。最低限度。亦將極力支持减低金利。政策。期一般事業能健全發展。防止物價之再低落。亦即所以啓示世界經濟回復之先兆也。然而商品價格。依然低落。存貨并未稍减。統制生產之實行力如何。尚爲疑問而全世界失業總數我中國缺乏統計姑不論。僅以歐美日本各主要國家合計已在三千萬以上有如此巨大之隱患。欲提高物價。而漠視一般社會之購買力。未免捨本而逐末已。</p>
<p>國際資本移動之復活。換言。即消除今日世界經濟之混亂狀態。而重新建立國際間正常金融關係。則短其債務之解决。與國際淸算銀行之活用。皆爲促進資本移動之一方法。但是否能確實施行。則又不能無疑。蓋德國方公佈停付外債本息。而各國又皆以經濟恐慌深化。致經濟基礎之產業界不能活動。上層之金融組織。自然不免殭化。縱令愼重審議。其結果究難樂觀。經濟問題中之關稅政策。洵爲當世崇尚國家的自給自足之結果。所謂國際協力救濟之道。在消極方面爲停止提高關稅。在積極方面爲减低關稅。重訂合理之關稅政策。或在經濟會議席上。作成國際間之協定。或促各國政府爲自主的行動。然而資本主義各國間。英美法意德日本。各自製作「經濟同盟。」蘇聯則在資本主義範疇之外。另立門户。是皆互相對立。欲其眞正協調。如何可能。故英日以政治上之聯盟國。而經濟裂痕顯然。法國則仍持其經濟的安全保障之故策。且非公式聲明有不利於法國貿易者。將增加關稅以爲報復。如是則關稅戰爭之完全停息。已非易事。而欲根本改訂稅則。恐難上加難矣。</p>
<p>是放今日欲撤除貿易上之壁障。减消各國自設之經濟的防禦。使國際貿易再上自由之途。輸出輸入。皆不受禁止及限制。以緩和世界經濟恐慌之深化。或欲促起各國政府共同行動。試爲生產者協定。不僅在貿易方面採取國際協調之步驟。且使各國生產者在小麥·木材·煤炭·等若干生產組織。先爲國際的自由協商。締結國際協定。以打開世界經濟恐慌之難局。皆屬一種烏托邦之空想也。</p>
<p>總之。世界經濟會議。無疑的爲。支撑資本主義經濟動搖之狀態。意圖打開一新出路。實際則係以英美法三國家之經濟協定爲標準。進而爲世界經濟之調和。並扶助各小國之經濟的破局。除德意志而外。其他各國。或能在國際調和之下。得暫時經濟安定之局。亦未可知。然而資本主義經濟的組織。根本缺陷。並未消解。世界經濟恐慌之。癌腫。依然存在。則此次世界經濟會議也者。不過在癌腫上補貼膏藥。縱使小康。亦僅一時。至於全愈之望。殊不敢必其果能實現也。</p>

<p>政友會有分裂之兆</p>
<p>齋藤内閣壽命不長</p>
<p>日本的政治、一方面掛着舉國一致内閣的大招牌、一方面又說是内閣無力、高倡强力論、而事實上、現在的日本也和其他的帝國主義一樣矛盾重重、自已沒有方法解决、譬如說拿到了東三省、起初軍部的意見、以爲根本的建設固然須要相當的時期、纔能有基礎、可是當前的失業問題、總可以得到相對適合的解决、到現在日本國内失業減少的數目、較官方發表不過比去年減少了兩萬人、實際上日本失業者最少有二百五十萬、在牠國内、各大都市到處都堆積着失業恐慌、農村的困疲并沒有減輕、「不景氣」的呼聲不過爲變象的戰爭所壓着而已、即以牠在東三省的情形而論、瀋陽·長春·哈爾濱·各城市、日本人去找事做的、各旅館中都住得滿滿地、一時得不到相當位置、縱然他們極力排斥華人、以及歸化於傀儡國的小小鬼、也不足以容納其朱業的智識分子、至於農業的移民終於因爲氣候的限制、出產品的差異、習慣的不同、恐怕還是不能得到什麽成果、牠越是擴在牠的軍事行動、則一般社會的財力越是枯涸、略有眞知識的日本人、大槪都曉得、的但很少敢直視現狀、敢明顯的把現狀暴露出來、除開作地下運動的革命黨、因爲日本的立憲政治本來就很空虚、資本家的力量縱然不小、却還不能克服刺刀的蠻橫、内閣并不對議會負責而軍部反有帷幄上奏特權、這回大阪市選舉、有權者投票的人不過百分之五十五、一般對所謂立憲政治的冷淡態度、、已經充分的表現出來了</p>
<p>這就是日本政潮鬧了這樣久、竟絲毫看不出有什麽意義、這并不是齋藤内閣有什麽値得人民擁護的政策、能使大衆起來維護他、更不是齋藤個人有什麽特殊本領、能克服當前的矛盾、也不是什麽舉國一致内閣眞能制服一切、然則嚷了差不多半年要倒的齋藤内閣、、如今還不倒的原因、究竟在那裏呢</p>
<p>第一是倒閣的集團丨政黨本身沒有力量、民政黨我們把牠算作準政府黨、國民同盟又是太小、都不說牠、政友會有三百頭議員、在議院中占絕對多權、假如牠眞正擁護立憲政治、與現政府絕緣、與軍部絕緣、奮發政治的爭鬥、豈但齋藤内閣倒臺、即軍部也要屈服於大衆之前的、可是政友會并沒有眞能打開時局、爲大衆謀福利的政綱政策、日本一般輿論從左到右、都不滿於旣成政黨的行爲、因此影響到議會政治制度、</p>
<p>再則政友會本身不健全、政綱政策的爭執并不很大、實質上還是人事關係的紛爭、例如此次倒閣運動、政友會除了幾句老生常談之外、并沒有什麽明快的政治運動、足以勝過現内閣、同時牠自己黨的本身、至少就分作兩大派、亟力主張倒閣的、他們自稱爲「强硬派」以勝田主計·小川平吉·山本悌二郎·川村竹治·島田俊雄·山口義一等、而附以從前森恪指揮之下的「二六會」爲核心、他們主張立即令政友會閣員辭職、表示與現内閣絕緣·樹立起自己的政綱、向憲政常道猛進所謂「自重派」在九州方面則有床次竹二郎一派、曰國有秋田淸一派、「關東有鳩山、前田·等、北海道則有木下謙次郎等、允原財閥也傾向於自重派、他們以爲齋藤内閣最多不過一年的壽命、政友會應該靜待其成熟、然後取而代之、現在應該暫時隱忍自重、對政府取監視的態度、這兩派已由暗鬥而開始顯然的分裂運動、現在已行各抓各派的議員羣衆、都各自分别集會商量對策、政友會如果折而爲二、則倒閣自然無力、</p>
<p>第二是軍部竭力主張維持現狀、主張非常時期的延長、荒木且公然「絕緣論」無一顧的價値、堅持舉國一致内閣說、并主張鈴木也入閣、於是政友會自重的人更不敢有什麽異議、勉强將就現狀、然而政友會自身旣陷於分裂、鈴木不能統率、其</p>
<p>他的人也恐怕難於收拾、日本的旣成政黨從今後是下山的夕陽、很難再起、政治上的强烈作用了、（一九三三·六·四日於東京）</p>

<p>僞軍問題、日代表岡村在天津與我代表會面之時、曾表示聽我方處置、詳細辦法、俟至長春與關東軍司令武藤會商後、再行答覆、乃一去多日、迄無回音日昨非正式表示、最好戰區僞軍由我方改編、暫駐原地點、而僞軍方面亦力請改編、我方對於此事、原主澈底解决、現在形勢更動、恐難辦到、故日來對於改編一層已不堅持反對、惟改編以後、必須另行調防整理、若仍留駐戰區以内、則後患無窮、萬難承諾、及至今日、此事尚在僵持之中、將來究竟如何解决、殊堪注意、日軍已陸續後撤、交接之際、僞軍橫梗其中、困難實多、當局對之、極爲焦慮、刻正在努力折衝、務求於最短期間、得一妥善辦法也、（十日）</p>

<p>申報醫藥週刊上海市近十年來醫藥鳥瞰（續）  龐京周第四章業務之情形第四節舊醫與國藥舊醫的業務。旣如上述。那麽舊藥的業務。當然也隨勢而變化。於是有改頭換面的新式國藥舖發生。首先提倡的日夜配方。代客煎藥。接方配方等辦法。以及各藥舖已經實行的。藥包外面標明藥名分量等辦法。此外則藥舖門面上的裝璜。由全底黑字招牌。改爲年紅電燈。由石庫門。改爲玻璃櫉窗。由靑花白地的丸藥瓶。改爲玻璃缸而已。但是藥商只管思想新頴。左不過受潮流之催促。而粉飾些表面文章。並且一切舉動。還是從西藥商方面脫胎而來。對於昔日「道他藥材」四字。當沒在切實的保證。所以一部份老輩的國醫。即未必以新式藥舖爲然。並且還抱懷疑的態度。數百年來不動不變的國藥業。僅到如今靠着上海的洋化。略略變動些些營業法。還不能得國醫的同情。也就可憐之至了。丨丨眞正國藥的改良呢。其權却决不操諸藥店夥之手。而實操諸舊醫之手。這是我國歷來醫藥學科不分開的緣故。然而目下的舊醫。知藥的能有若干。要問他某藥還是草本還是木本。是水產是土產。恐怕不能答復。再看新藥家研究舊本草的精神。外國藥物學研究所裏的設備和著作。就可以恍然於將來國藥。是否須由科學家代爲整理了。約莫在十年以前。上海市一部份舊醫。曾經有一度團結。創設新式藥店呌作粹華製藥廠。竟用飲片煎劑。納入藥瓶。如西藥一般服法。雖然風靡一時。而終久因非驢非馬。不得全體舊醫和病家的同情。而生涯漸趨冷落。偏偏該店所製杏仁霜。又因配劑不匀。吃壞了人。於是粹華藥店也就宣吿淸理。現在各種新式國藥舖。本不一定靠配方。而大都靠些補品。如販賣關東（新外國）鹿茸。高麗人參。西洋人參。那些外國貨而立足。則粹華若在今日。也不妨兼　血淸針藥。再出些丸散膏丹。也未嘗不可圖利呢。此外有專售製劑的丸散店。及各老藥舖的丸散部。據說營業也大不如前。第一個原因是原料困難。成本過高。第二個原因是農村中購買力減少。第三個原因。他們的營業法不知道隨着交通而推進。所以被西藥的成藥商奪了地盤去。但是那些藥店。却錯怪新醫鼓吹學說。其實新醫對於一般西藥的家用成藥。何嘗提倡呢。聞余子維先生遺囑解剖遺骸事敬吿國人（下）  余雲岫　　諸君要曉得’殘忍慈悲這幾個字’是相對的名詞’不是絕對的眞理·殘忍有大小’慈悲也有大小’爲了一點小不忍’就不顧全了大慈悲’這種人就是殘忍’爲了大慈悲’就不顧全了小不忍’這種人就是慈悲’病理解剖是大慈大悲的事’顧不得小不忍’而且病理解剖並沒有什麽殘忍’解剖了已死的屍體’使得治病的醫家’曉得其中癓結’對於後來無千無萬同病相憐的人’或者能夠尋覓得較爲有效的處置’祓除五大洲生靈的疾苦’救濟億萬年病家的性命’這是何等功德’何等慈悲債。至於對於被解剖的病屍講起來’也很對得他住’他是終究要腐爛的’行了病理解剖以後腐爛’和全軀腐爛’有什麽不同’而且行了病理解剖以後腐爛’雖然腐爛’還能夠留着狠大的功績在社會’若是他的肝肺或者其他藏府’有了變化明著的病象’還可以保存到醫學校病理敎室裏面’做個紀念品’年年歲歲’供學子的觀摩’助醫育的進步’比較全屍腐爛’無聲無臭’無影無踪的那般屍骨’着實亮漂得多了’放着這種大慈大悲的功德不做’保守了一定要腐爛消滅的屍體’不肯動其毫毛’說是孝子慈孫的存心’據我看來’到是無上的殘忍哩’因爲不肯行病理解剖’那末和死者同樣的一種毛病’就無研究的可能’換一句說’就是不許犧牲這個一定要腐爛的皮肉’來祓除生靈疾苦’救濟病家性命’務要完全放在棺裏去’忍心使得極好的研究機會失掉’弄得這個悶葫蘆’永遠沒有揭曉的日子’於是乎五大洲的生靈’千秋萬歲後的同病者’就此一齊絕望’這是何等忍心的事呀’世界屍體處置的方法’本沒有一定的’有用火葬的’有用木乃伊法的’有主張厚葬的’有主張薄葬的’各隨各的宗敎風俗習慣而不同’我們的全軀納入棺中’憑他慢慢地腐爛消滅的方法’並不算是天經在義仁至義盡的法’莊子的書’有一段說道’「莊子將死’門人欲厚葬之’莊子曰’吾以天地爲棺槨’以日月爲連璧’星辰爲珠璣’萬物爲齎送’吾葬具豈不備耶’何以加此’弟子曰’吾恐烏鳶之食夫子也’莊子曰’在上爲烏鳶食’在下爲螻蟻食’奪彼與此’何其偏也’）這才是通人的議論’但莊子還是從均等的方面較量’若一方有益無損’一方無益有損’當然吏應該避損趨益的了。　　我爲了這件事’於去年開在浙江的第二次全國醫師代表大會中’提出一個議案’其議題是「勸吿全國醫師’組織病理解剖有志會’」其理由是「學術研究方面’實地診療方面’醫學之進步’病理解剖所負荷者’至深且鉅’而我國風氣’古來皆保全屍體’不欲毁傷’醫學之落伍’玄談之流行’實以此風氣爲重大之原因’欲醫學之發達’非病理解剖興盛不可’欲病理解剖興盛’非科學醫以向作則’先犧牲其死後屍體’則不足以指導民衆’變改積習’故科學新醫’’宜組織身後病理解剖有志會’以示倡導则開風氣’）現在竟有余子維先生’　夠實行遺骸之病理解剖’使得我不由不崇拜’我願我科學新醫們’都崇拜這個實行家’都效法這個實行家’那末病理解剖的風氣’就可以漸漸開明了’我現在把他的記錄原文’抄在下面。（故醫學士余先生諱綱’宇子維’别號森子’浙江平陽縣人’素負大志’當有革命思想’淸季憤朝政之不修’歎國事之日非’毅然東渡’肄業慈惠醫學’從事其革命工作’嘗與先總理孫中山革命策略’主張敎育救國’專事宣傳及著作’以期喚醒民衆爲宗旨’不求個人之聞達’現年六十有一’於去年五六月間’患肝胃病’在彌留　’猶與知友縱談革命’並立遺囑’將遺體病理解剖’以供醫藥界之研究’遺囑原文（余由中醫而習西醫’嘗謂解剖乃研究醫學之要務’茲余病胃癌’深知無生理’死後應將余屍體即行剖視’求其癓結之所在’余子及壻’曁知友等’多習西醫’必能成余志而解剖之’遺體可火化之’若火化不便’應單獨葬於太平天國之遺民王小谷先生之墓下’亦所以志余革命之意於永遠也’此囑’森子’證明人游若’余繼崙’金嶸軒’李素冰’黃湘’王居素’管仲榆’中華民國二十二年一月三十日’范任執律’）茲悉余先生已於前日（二十三）夜二時逝世’遺體於昨日下午二時’在大南醫院舉行解剖’當時各機關各法團代表’及本城醫師’地方人士’前往參觀者’約百餘人’先向余先生遺體致敬禮’繼由醫師黃湘李素冰等’依法行腹部切開’見腹腔内有血性液體流出’次則胃及肝部露出’胃如小兒頭大’腫瘍紅腫粗糙’表面略有破潰’次則肝藏摘出’見右葉外側有手掌大’帶黃白色腫脹’肝藏及胃’均比尋常大二倍’餘與生前所診斷之肝藏胃癌無異’惟病變蔓延如此之廣’亦不多覯’蓋與孫中山先生所患之病相似’現摘出部份’由其哲嗣余德蓀君帶往杭州醫校’作病理標本之研究’將來定有報吿’以公於世’又余先生生平著作’行將付印’並道囑家屬親友等’出資組織衛生敎育會’以期提倡衛生’普及敎育’而垂永久’期哲嗣德蓀君對於此旨’非常努力’日内徵求同志’從事組織’以副先生之遺意’而造福於社會也’去年全國醫師聯全會提議醫生死後’應將屍體解剖’以供醫學上之研究’先生可謂中國破天荒之第一人也。）我寫完了記錄原文以後’還要向社會諸君敬吿一聲’我們新醫界中’對於病理解剖’已經有了實行家余子維先生開始了’此後聞風興起’一定續續有人’但是除了新醫界以外的人物’對於此事’也應該竭力提倡’使得病理解剖這件事’成了通俗化’那末我們貴中國’方才是個實事求是的國家’不但醫學有切實的發展’别的事情’也照樣誠誠懇懇實行起來’不比從來只有標語’只有口號的滑頭行爲’我可以保證’十年二十年之後’一定可以變爲强國了。（完）參觀健康敎育展覽會感言  宋國賓　　本市敎育衛生兩局’有健康敎育展覽會之舉行’記者因衛生局科長吳君利國之領導得以盡覽其詳。物品之陳列’佈置之閎美使入其中者’左盼右囑’有應接不暇之勢。季扎觀樂’有止焉之歎’猗歟盛哉’蔑以加矣！　　緣本會之說’其主因有二’蓋健康</p>

<p>自由談漁艇現代靑年的迷惘  郎損　　假如有一個靑年在「五四」那時吃了睡藥’沉睡十年’而今忽然驚醒’定睛一看’他那驚詫’當非言語所能形容罷！　　第一’他所崇拜的新文化鉅子大半搖身一變’從詛咒軍閥官僚而變爲依附軍閥官僚’從擁護靑年的利益變而爲屠殺靑年的劊子手。第二’十年前想也不會想到的混辭黑暗殘酷而今成了家常便飯’而且人們的忍耐力擴大到可驚的不合理的程度。第三’假如他找到了從前的夥伴’就知道他們不是變到不認識就是已經老了；也許他不免要提起「火燒趙家樓」的故事’那麽’老了的舊夥伴只有搖頭太息’而變了的却依然神氣活現大駡「曹陸該打！」並且提出警句來’說是「今日之糟都是從前人的罪惡。」而第四’假如他仍想進學校’則普遍的男女同校以及社交公開將使他一喜’而更普遍的女生艶裝和男生逛跳舞塲又將使他一驚；他記得從前是穿了絲襪就要被駡爲墮落’看看電影就要被駡爲腐敗。他一定糊塗到要發瘋！　　世上不會有一睡十年那樣的事’可是現方二十歲的靑年翻看十年前的「歷史」和眼前的現實一比較’也不免要迷惶到發瘋罷？如果他再翻看三十年前的「歷史’一看到曹陸的學生時代也是如何革命’也許他會點頭嘆息道··「歷史是循環反覆’一蟹不如一蟹！」　　於是迷惘的他也許從此悲觀’或者流入於中國式的虚無主義了罷？　　但假如他能用功’能夠從社會科學的理論上去解决他的迷惘’他就會知道歷史原來未嘗環反覆；在混亂黑暗殘酷十倍百倍於十年前的今日’在混亂黑暗殘酷的又一面’也有那反抗的勢力十倍百倍於十年前了！歷史是在前進呵！而且因爲時代的輪子不是在虚空中進展’所以障礙的增多就證明了進展的勇猛劇烈呵！這好像是老生常談麽？然而假如你走出書齋’到十字街頭’到農村’就能看見老生常談不是空頭支票。　　只有到十字街頭到農村中去體騐鐵一般的事實’靑年們的迷惘纔能得到眞正救解。「在三層樓上展開」與「骨董之描寫」質疑  達伍　　胡秋原先生’近來出了一本書’呌「唯物史觀藝術論」’一寸多厚’眞是介紹文藝理論驚人的巨著。然而大抵是這本書太厚’太多的緣故罷’我總看不完。但另一個比我勤勉的小朋友却拿去看完了。在附錄第三則ＭａｒｃＤｃｋｏｗｉｃｚ的「文藝創作之機構」中’他發現了兩個疑問’拿去和另一譯文對照了一下’出入之處雖然很多’但都可以通過’只有這「在三層樓上展開」’和「骨董之描寫」’兩語不僅相差很遠’而胡先生的譯文’連我也無法解釋。我旣找不出外國譯本或原文來對照’終想不透這「在三層樓上展開」的是裸體跳舞呢’還是其他把戲；「骨董之描寫」是由於「描寫骨董」或「寫骨描董」之誤譯或誤排’都可疑惑。根據有疑必問的治學方法’向蒲力汗諾夫的嫡傳文藝理論家質一點擬’大槪是可以的罷？「唯物史觀藝術論」第七二○頁第十二行’胡譯「文藝創作之機構」譯文如下··「·····但對於我們問題不在此！Ｘ先生的奇遇’和Ｙ女士的情火對於我們有什麽關係呢？在公餘之後’車中飯罷之後’我們開始作詳細研究’這對於我們有什麽重要？這在三層樓上展開。首先’我們從書籍回溯作家。·····」　　另一譯文是戴望舒譯伊可維支「唯物史觀的文學論」第四章’第三一一頁第四行··　　「·····可是我們不來管這種事丨Ｘ先生的奇遇’或是Ｙ小姐的熱情’和我們有什麽關係呢？這事是在市長先生前面吿終的’或是在餐車裏吿終的’和我們有什麽關係呢？我們要開始一個展成三個階段的長研究。第一’我們從書上溯到作家。·····」　　　　胡譯同書七二一頁末行··「在極端個人主義之中’在細末節與骨董之描寫’······」　　戴譯同書三一四頁’第三行··「在激烈的個人主義中’在瑣碎’長雜的描寫，·····」　　文中加圈的地方’就是兩種譯文相異之處。戴譯一看便很明白’正確與否’雖無把握’但可以解得通的；胡先生的譯文却把我引上三層高樓’終不得見天日。爲什麽在公餘之後’車中飯罷之後’我們開始作詳細的研究’對於我們沒有什麽得要呢？爲什麽從書籍回溯作家’定要到三層樓上纔肯展開’那麽秘密珍藏呢？「骨董」兩字是用作副詞來形容「描寫」呢’還是說明描寫内容的呢？我雖然辛辛苦苦爬上了三層樓’也還看不明白’不得下樓。大抵這就是山東河南一帶新出土的「骨董」’不容易識貨罷。　　我希望胡秋原先生或其他找得到原文的海内文豪助我一臂之力！一個不平凡的故事  ＭＺｏｓｈｃｈｅｎｋｏ著西曼譯　　一神秘的門這人在樓梯頂上的一層站住了。他探索着他的口袋’摸出一枝火柴擦燃着。微紅的’𠙦弱的火焰照亮了黃�銅的門牌。牌上是這樣的寫着··　「雅珂夫·彼羅維支·斯曼」　　牙科醫生　「這就是的」。陌生的人自語；找不到門鈴’他只好敲門了。一會兒以後’門輕輕的開了。「原諒我」’陌生的人問’很謹愼的走進瞑暗的客室。「醫生今天還能看病嗎？」　「你稍稍候一會罷」’醫生冷淡的說’「還有一個病人就完了。」　「好’我可以等的。」陌生的人温雅的同意着說。　　醫生銳利的望了他一眼。猙獰的冷笑··　　「到飯廳裏等’請隨我來！」　　陌生的人還沒坐穩’醫生立刻退了回來’跳出屋外’砰地一聲　上了厚大的門。隨着是的搭的鎖門聲。　　陌生的人’成色死灰。若有所失的尋望着屋的四周。簡直就是空的··除去一張蓋着桌布的桌子’一對木椅’再沒有其字的東西了。　　二牙醫給陌生的人看病　　二十分鐘過後’牙醫雅珂夫斯曼來看這陌生的人。　　「太對不起了’」牙醫說’「我把你鎖在飯廳裏。可是你看’我沒有女僕’你是知道我們現在是什麽時代。不久以前’一個來看病的人從屋裏的衣架上竊去一件大衣。再過一些時候’另一件皮大衣又不見了。今天呢’你或許知道’有幾個窮人把我這屋裏的最後一個銅痰盂也偷跑了。我簡直就要不幹這事情了。唔’我正給一個病人忙碌的時候’另外的病人們就捲凈了候客室裏的東西逃跑了。現在我不能不預防了。請原宥我罷！·····請張開嘴。」　　「嘿！······」陌生的人漠然的說’張開了他的嘴。　　三文雅的事情　　陌生的人走到街上’在燈柱旁停住了。諷譏的微笑着。　　「該死！讓我來看看這破東西到底怎樣罷！」　　從他的大衣下面他拖出一塊桌布’展開它。　　「這是一塊爛桌布啊’唔’處處都是補綻丨」齒間懣怨着。他憤慨的用力扯這爛布。　　於是他頓着脚往前走’他喃喃的自語··「嘿’是的’不要介意。除去這塊爛桌布’那裏還有其它的東西呢。以後就不許再拿那對椅子了嗎？」　陌生的人聳聳肩’慢慢的走了。紅蘿蔔鬚  Ｊｕｌｅｓ　Ｋｅｎａｒｏ作林取譯保險箱（續）瑪狄爾德丨他開保險箱時要說一個字。那究竟什麽字？紅蘿蔔鬚丨你不必追問’這是白費氣力的事情。祇你答應我永遠不轉吿别人’將來我們結了婚的時候’我可以把這字吿訴你。瑪狄爾德丨請你馬上吿訴我罷。我可以馬上答應你永遠不把這字轉吿别人。紅蘿蔔鬚丨不’這是爸爸和我兩個人所有的秘密。瑪狄爾德丨你不知道這字的。如果你知道這字’你便會吿訴我的。紅蘿蔔鬚丨對不起’我知道這字。瑪狄爾德丨你不知道’你不知道。這正好’這正好。「我們來打賭罷’」紅蘿蔔鬚一板正經地說。「賭什麽呢？」瑪狄爾德躊躇着。「讓我隨便在你身上什麽地方摸一摸’我便把那字吿訴你。」紅蘿蔔鬚說。瑪狄爾德凝視着紅蘿蔔鬚。她有點莫明其妙。她差不多把她那雙灰色的陰險的眼睛全閉上了’她起初祗有一種好奇心’現在倒有兩種了。「先把那字吿訴我再說’紅蘿蔔鬚。」紅蘿蔔鬚丨你要向我發誓’我吿訴你以後’你便讓我隨便在你身上什麽地方摸一摸。</p>
<p>瑪狄爾德丨媽媽不准我發誓。紅蘿蔔鬚丨那麽我不吿訴你了。瑪狄爾德丨我用不着你吿訴了。我已經猜到’對啦’我已經猜到。紅蘿蔔鬚忍耐不住了’他不再囉囌了。「聽我說啦’瑪狄爾德’你什麽都沒有猜到。可是我相信你會守約的’不要你發誓了。爸爸在開保險箱以前說出的那個字是“Ｌｕｓｌｕｃｒｕ”、現在我可以隨便在你身上什麽地方摸一摸了。」「Ｌｕｓｔｕｃｒｕ！Ｌｕｓｔｕｃｒｕ！」瑪狄爾德一面往後退’一面這樣念着’她心裏有着認識一個秘密的快樂’同時又害怕這是沒有半點用處的謊語。「眞的’你不騙我嗎？」隨後’當紅蘿蔔鬚默不作聲’下了决心’伸着手向她走來時’她便溜之大吉。紅蘿蔔鬚祗聽到她一聲乾笑。當他聽見後面有人在嘲弄他時’她已跑得無影無踪了。他回轉身來。爵府裏的一個僕人從一座廐房裏的屋項窗上伸出頭來叱責着他。「我看見你做的事情了’紅蘿蔔鬚’」那僕人呌說着’一我會要通通吿訴你的母親的。」紅蘿蔔鬚丨我剛才在頑着呢’皮爾老爹。我想騙騙那小瑪狄爾德。Ｌｕｓｔｕｃｒｕ是我自己想出來的一個假名詞。其實我並不知道那個眞字。皮爾丨你放心罷’紅蘿蔔鬚’我並不管你的什麽Ｌｕｓｔｕｃｒｕ’我不會把這事吿訴你母親。可是我要把餘外的事吿訴她。紅蘿蔔鬚丨餘外的事？皮爾丨對啦’餘外的事。我已經看見你做的事情了’我已經看見你做的事情了’紅蘿蔔鬚；你說說看有沒有看見你做的事情。啊！你這點點大就會做出這樣的事情來啦。但你今天晚上當心一頓飽打罷！紅蘿蔔鬚我不出一句話回答。臉孔脹得比他自己的頭髮還要紅’他把兩手插在衣袋裏’垂頭喪氣地走開了。</p>

不採取下列的方式··　　甲國商品丨乙國貨丨甲國貨幣丨乙國貨幣丨乙國商品。在這種情形之下’國際匯兌就成了國際貿易過程中所必不可少的階段。　　會議中的貨幣問題的内容’歸納起來’爲兩個要點··　　（一）企圖採取國際的通貨幣’以穩定國際匯兌的比價。就第一個要點來說；我們知道當今的物價低落是生產過剩消費減退的結果’是資本主義本質的缺陷；而絕非通貨流通影響所致。在恐慌期内’物價所以低落的原因’一方面是生產過剩’另一方面是勞動的生產力增大致商品價値減小而價格低落。在這種塲合’貨幣價値的增高’並非由貨幣少於必要的流通量’而由於物質的低落’所以如採取通貨膨脹政策’以人爲的力量’降低貨幣的價値’使物價抬高’在國内市塲’雖可有局部的暫時的效果’但在國際市塲’則以關稅戰爭不能休止’通貨膨脹政策不但不能解救目前的恐慌’反使國際經濟更爲糾紛。　　通貨膨脹有三種形態’信用擴張’匯兌比價降低’和紙幣增發。現在我們還不知道會議對於通貨膨脹政策’究將採取那一種形態’但就世界經濟的趨勢看來’信用制度不獨未見擴張而反日益收縮。國際匯兌比價的降落’又因各主要金本位國家先後放棄金本位制度、而致其效力亦漸歸無用。至增發紙幣、可使紙幣成爲不兌換紙幣’而引起更大的問題。　　再就第二個要點來說國際匯兌比價的高下’影響於國際貿易者至重且大’現今世界各國’尚維持金本位者’除法國外’祇有瑞士’荷蘭’比利時’德意志’和意大利等。因貨幣單位的不一致、又以資本主義希國獨霸金融市塲’遂使國際匯兌比價時有上下’實是國際貿易的一大障碍。要除去這障碍’則確定國際匯兌的比價’實是要圖。據六月七日國民社華盛頓電訉；美國將在會議中提議採用一虚金單位’以爲各國貨比價的標準’藉圖穩定國際匯兌的比價。　　這個問題’是否能得大會通過’祇要看各國對貨幣問題的態度。　　一九三一年九月’英國放棄金本位’鎊的國際匯兌比價大跌’去年十一月間’竟跌至英金一鎊値美金三元一角五分又十六份之一’開空前的紀錄。英國之所以採此政策’亦是實行通貨膨脹的一法藉此以爲與美國爭取經濟霸權的武器。那知日本亦跟着於棄金本位’結果日金跌價比英鎊更甚’使英國在遠東的商業大受打擊。而最近美國又通過廢除金本位的法案’從此美金可和英鎊比賽跌價’爭奪世界經濟的霸權’由此看來’帝國主義者正在競爭利用匯兌比價的低落’以爭取世界市場’豈肯確定匯兌比價’以減少競爭的方法呢？　　至於國際的通貨膨脹’是否能够實行’當以關稅戰爭是否能休止爲斷’關稅戰爭’一向是美國經濟爭霸的武器’乃自廢除金本位後’美金匯兌比價跌落’此種武器已無甚足用’故羅斯福就提倡關稅休戰’可是歐洲各國爲聯合抵制美金的跌價’阻止美國在歐洲擴張市塲起見’大有主張維持關稅壁壘’聯事對美之趨勢’東亞的日本也正在計議增高英貨的入口稅以爲英國和印度增加日貨入口稅的報復。在這種情形之下’要藉國際的通貨膨脹來解救當令的恐慌’恐怕也不是一件容易的事情。從白宫談話到倫敦經濟會議巴倫　　再三拖延的世界經濟會議’總算在今日）一九三三年六月十二日）下午三時在英國倫敦開會了’參加的有六十五國’所有各國代表與專家顧問’參加這次會議的’多至二千餘人’可知各國對於這次世界經濟會議的重視和期望的殷切了。　　在開會前的一個月’先有一次美國白宫的國際協商’美總統羅斯福氏邀集英法德日與我國代表’到華盛頓白宫’談話了多次。本來這次白宫談話’似可緩和各帝國主義者間的衝突’給予倫敦會議’不少的希望。不料這是羅斯福氏的一種手段’他無非想利用白宫談話’來確立美國在世界經濟會議的地位’越發暴露帝國主義間的矛盾。逆料這次倫敦經濟會議的結果’恐怕不會如吾人理想中的來得圓滿吧！　　顧這次白宫談話的結果怎樣？官家報吿’旣閃鑠其詞’使我人很難探其眞相’不過有幾件事情’足値得吾人注意的。　　第一’美國宣佈放棄金本位’這不僅對英法日的一大打擊’同時也成了國際協調的致命　　　　自從英日　　　　　　　　　英　　價格大跌’他們的目的’無非要想在遠東市塲’保持着貿易爭勝的局面吧了。不過英國在貿易上最大的勁敵’就是美國’英鎊跌價’也就是和美國鬥爭的唯一武器。誰料羅斯福就在麥唐納赴美國的途中’宣布通貨膨脹政策’禁金出口’使美金跌價。麥唐納到美’本想要求羅斯福取消戰債’减低保護關稅’而事實上却是完全不可能’結果還是挾着滿腔的失望回去。　　同樣的’法柋表赫禮歐到華盛頓去’亦想把美法共同維持金本位’作爲取消戰債的交換條件’但是美國現在自動放棄金本位’赫禮歐又怎能開口呢？　　第二’在倫敦經濟會議開幕以前’美國忽又打起關稅休戰的旗號。年來美國已築起關稅壁壘’把它自己的市塲封閉起來’怎樣忽又唱着關稅休戰的高調呢？這是因爲他有了新的有效武器’美金跌價’自然可把舊的放棄了。講到各國呢’自從一九三○年後’都紛紛實行新稅則起來’本來不肯貿然廢掉’加以美金價跌’更有侵入各國市塲的危險’各國更不願解除他們　經濟武　了。　　第三’倫敦經濟會議所提出討論的議題’是（一）通貨與信用政策；（二）物價；（三）資本移動問題；（四）國際貿易的限制；（五）關稅及協定政策；（六）生產及貿易的組織。實際上這些問題’都直接或間接和貨幣制度’有密切的關係’各國也共同明瞭這點’所以羅斯福在白宫’對各國代表談話時’便提到什麽提高銀價與各國中央銀行使用金銀準備等辦法。推其要旨’似在實施國際的通貨膨脹政策。講到這種政策’因爲各國匯兌比價的難以維持’事實上’恐后不易辦到。白宫的談話’無異已經揭示着各資本主義國所懷的鬼胎今日在倫敦舉行的經濟會議’雖已開幕’但是結局呢？恐怕和一九二七年日内瓦的世界經濟會議’同樣的慘淡與悲觀！世界經濟會議之難關楚　　美國羅斯福總統’爲解决洛桑會議之懸案’挽敎世界經濟之恐慌’在華盛頓召開世界經濟預備會議’以爲倫敦正式會議之準備。其主要議案’爲戰債’軍縮’關稅’匯兌’等國際問題。其間戰債軍縮問題’關係世界經濟尤爲重大’羅斯福總統鑒於國内外形勢之推移’不得不謀解决之策。惟茲事體大’非事前先與各國接洽’恐難進行’故於四月八日與各國代表開始預備商談。此預備會議之提案’首重在貿易自由與國際通貨之恢復’其他戰債軍縮等政治問題’亦屬於討論範圍之内。　　最初會商者爲英國’當時所提出之（一）世界物價之提高；（二）商業政策之改革；（三）貿易制限之改革；（四）世界信用之擴張；（五）政府資金之支出；（六）國際通貨本位之再建’（七）銀價之提高等七大經濟復興案。據傳雙方稍有諒解。次與法國商議戰債’通貨’軍縮等問題’亦於四月二十八日得法代表之同意’發表共同聲明書’如排除關稅’輸入’匯兌等國際貿易上之障碍’與提高世界物價’回復經濟狀况等。雙方意見’亦漸一致’他如與加拿大代表之共同聲明增大商品之交換’挽回國際的通貨本位制；與意大利代表交换經濟的軍縮與軍事的軍縮；與德國代表討論軍縮問題’與我國墨西哥代表交換銀問題等’大抵在原則上均有諒解’惟具體的數字上之協定’尚須待倫敦會議時决定；此爲華盛頓會議經過之梗槪。　　然當會商時’美國突然停止金本位制’英國增加匯兌平衡資金’德國要求軍備平等’英法提高關稅稅率’種種重大難題’相繼發生。推厥其由’要不外在倫敦正式會議時’藉爲讓步牽制之手段。故美國雖已首先主唱關稅休戰案’而其他各國’能否互相讓步’成立具體的協定’尚屬疑問’何則’就各國經濟狀况而言’欲確立相互的關稅協定’低减稅率’在事實上頗爲困難’蓋各國咸以關稅收入爲唯一之財源’且爲保護本國產業之工具’一旦低减’財政上社會上必受重大影響。况英國自去年成立喔泰華協定’已完成特惠關稅政策’今若解除關稅聯結’對於英國產業振興之基礎’不免發生動搖’苟英國欲應美之要求’須有戰債問題等爲交換代價。至於法國’較美國爲尤甚’蓋法國因德國希特拉政策’無日不防禦德國之復仇’故一方由經濟問題進而要求政治的安全保障’他方因圓價低落’拒絕戰債償付’因此所謂英美法三國已有默契之說’究竟在何程度’能否至倫敦會議時不發生重大糾紛’實難預言。　　特對於戰債問題’美國主張單獨討論’而英法等國’以戰債與軍縮有連帶關係’且堅持美不讓步’拒絕償付成見、但美國對於歐洲戰債’總額逹百十五億元’到期之債’如再遷延不繳’財政上愈陷困難’故不願放棄原有權利’美如不讓步’勢必由戰債而牽動其他問題。况匯兌之安全與否’全由戰債以左右之’匯兌動搖’則各種經濟問題’更無解决之方。　　次爲軍縮’查今日全世界約需八十億之軍備’各國因擴大軍備’以致國家赤字財政’逐年增加’甚至歲人大部分’充於軍備費。設非實行縮减’則不生產的龐大軍費’在在影嚮一國財政之基礎’然而各國國情不同’國際情勢紛亂’法忌德意’日防美俄’虎視耽耽’危機四伏’咸謀國防充實之不暇’欲實行制限縮减’在事實上勢所不能。甚至侵略國家’竟欲推翻凡爾條約’破壞倫敦華盛頓軍縮制限’銳意擴張；是則美國雖有消弭戰禍之心’無如各國之利害關係’究不能以一國單獨政策’得以解决之也。况一旦實行軍縮’停止軍艦武器製造’失業者愈多’此輩失業者’若令其轉業於他種生產’則生產額愈形過剩。而各國自去年來’農產品價格暴落’工業品銷路滯澀’今驟然新增如許失業者’更無法以處置之。　　最後爲通貨問題’尤爲複雜。所謂物價之平準’中央銀行制度’通貨本位制度’銀價問題’匯兌制限問題等’皆有連帶關係’而各國幣制與金融產業狀况’各異其步調’性質旣殊’轉變自難’偶一不愼’影響全國安危。　　由此以觀’在錯綜紛雜之情勢中’欲覓一共通利弊之點’誠非易易。故美國雖有挽回世界經濟恐慌之野心’而各國咸因切身利害計’恐難照預定計畫’貫澈初衷也。所望各國捐除成見’互相讓步’在此重大會議中’成立國際協調’則全世界人類’均可登諸袵席矣。商業新聞金融洋拆仍小收解靜　　昨星期日、銀行方面一律封關、故各種市面非常冷靜、市塲中洋拆反而復小、計開八分、較前小去四分、銀行無收解可言、錢莊拆票交易、早市轉賬四百十餘萬、新交易八十餘萬、午市交易七十餘萬、小總會交易四十餘萬、公單收解二千八百餘萬、各路匯欵三十餘萬、輔幣市價江南小洋早午兩市同爲八百五十五元三角、略好三角、做出交易僅早市五千五百角、廣東小洋早市七百七十五元七角、午市爲七百七十五元八角、交易早市四萬五千角、午市二萬角、銅元加長一千三百文、爲三百十六千八百文、交易三萬八千○十六千文、計代價洋一萬二千元、　　　早市　　　　　　　午市洋拆　八分　　　　　　　八分江南八百五十五元三角八百五十五元三角廣東七百七十五元七角七百七十五元八角拆兌一千二百八十九角二０一千二百八十九角銅元三百十六千八百文三百十六千八百文衣牌三千一百六十八文三千一百六十八文角坯二百四十六文二百四十六文貼水七十一文七十一文證劵上週債市高漲　　丨好起一元幾角至四元外丨　　上週六月五日至十日、華商證劵交易所、以中美棉麥借欵、忽吿成立、此事醖釀已一二年、在簽字前、旣無消息、而於週一上午俄頃間、成立消息、忽然傳遍市塲、市價於週一二兩日、漲風之熱烈、幾使空頭無回旋餘地、如週一上午頭盤、一部份得有消息、而懷疑者尚屬不少、故市價漲上祗一元餘、次盤多數已知確係事實、再漲兩元數角、其中有三種公債已經漲逾四元而停收、下午一盤開拍甚遲、晚報已將該項消息刋載、市塲人氣更形緊張、再漲二元餘、統鹽稅亦吿漲停拍、情勢之優、近年罕見、週二祗做兩盤、上午開盤編遣裁兵漲勢仍勁裁兵最高價爲六十五元七角、此則自去歲五月復業已來之最高新紀錄、惟以價抬過高、招來實貨之抛賣、故人後各種、均皆由高而下、跌落元許、軒然大波、至此平息週三略起回風、多頭出籠、回跌一元四五角、週四起卽漸人於盤旋混沌之途、每日上落均祗半元左右、綜觀一週經過、漲風原因、至爲單純、大漲小回、復趨於盤旋安定之途、一週經過、裁兵最高價六十五元七角、爲週二之次盤、統稅最高價四十九元五角、鹽稅最高價爲五十元零五角、結果比前漲一元數角至四元餘、其中整六漲風最熾、計漲四元四角五分之多、按數日來、北帮空頭抵補、但結果仍係空頭、一號十一十四十六及二十號均係空頭、二十一三十八四十四四十七及五十號等均係多頭、存帳數尚有二千餘萬、故届六月之末一星期、或尚有較劇之變動也、目下多空雙方、勢均力敵、尚未有顯著之破綻也、成交數亦發見最高紀錄、共計九千八百九十六萬二千五百元、内現貨六萬七千五百元、期貨統鹽稅兩種、竟佔三千五

<p>申報本埠增刋電影專刋好萊塢思想中的「忒克諾克拉西」（Ｔｅｃｈｎｏｃｒａｃｙ）（上）  竹仙　　美國的Ｔｅｃｈｎｏｃｒａｃｙ狂熱’似　乎到現在還沒消歇’還有許多人紛紛討論著。Ｔｅｃｈｎｏｃｒａｃｙ這字的譯名’到現在還沒有一個權位’可以確定牠。我們所知道的譯名中’有「專家統治’」「技術統治’」「技術主義」’等名詞’但是爲存其原文意味的精髓’我們還要暫譯音作爲「忒克諾克拉西」而加以英文的註解。好在「克拉西」（如德謨克拉西等）我們是認識的’是涉及統治與政體等意思的。　　「忒克諾克拉西」的意味是什麽？我們現在祇可說一個大槪’就是現在人類在機械生活發達到極度的時代’一切人類的幸福’都操在工程師’技術家’專們人員的手裏。那末’爲什麽不使他們掌理國家之大權’管理國家的一切生產事業’而造成人類最高限度的幸福呢。這執是抽象方面’「脫克諾克拉西產生的理由。至於實質方面’「忒克諾克拉西」成功之後’民衆有什麽好處呢？還可以簡單的說一句「人民可以少做事’多休息’多享受’人人平等······」。譬方說’將來一切生產事業機械等’統通歸一個專家政府辦理了’他們施用科學的原則管理一切生產與銷耗；這樣他們按照大衆所需要的一切東西’在若干時間内製造了分配給大衆。這樣一來’據他們約略的計算’每個人每天祇須工作四小時’每星期祇須工作四天’每年每人的工資’約爲二萬美金’並且二十五歲以下’及四十五歲以上的人’多不用工作。這樣不是人人平等’可以少工作而多享受嗎？並且每年收入二萬金’不許存貯’一定要化完’以防止私產制度的復興。　　這種技術主義的政治’已經有多少學者討論了十多年’現在宣佈出來’居然轟動一時。大人先生們口裏’要不會說幾句「忒克諾克拉西」的話’要被人家當作阿木林的。所以好萊塢的影星們’閒時聚在一起’都要提到「忒克諾克拉西」的一字’以示「淵博」。雖是有幾位女明星’除了塗脂擦粉’講究衣飾之外’問到她們對於這「忒克諾克拉西」的意見’她們膛目不知所對’可是還有許多明星如范朋克父子’卓别靈等’都特别買了幾本書’在家裏研究一下。不然偶然被人家問倒了’那是很難爲情的。（未完）影片談評評南京大戲院的新片  燕南　　三片都在水平線以上　　兩張音樂一張是宗敎　　這是一　正片世界上的潮流’本無所謂革新’只有復古’特别是思想和藝術品’我們看吧！十年前落伍的體裁丨宗敎丨到今年又一一搬上銀幕來了。　　故事是一個宗敎化的老農夫’救濟了孤兒’又帮助了私生子’和被家庭驅逐出來的少女’結果遭惡人暗算’不過仗了上帝的感靈（？）’聖經的萬能’終於勝利而大團圓了。　　這片子雖涉及迷信宗敎’但是大體上’尚不違背人情。這一齣喜劇的收尾’老人並不是物質上的勝利’也不是欲望方面的得獲’而是精神上的愉快和安慰。劇中雖有極重要的戀愛穿插’但是輕輕抹過’而詆毁社會不情的態度’孤獨人的處境’上帝（？）協助善人的結果’自始至始’拿宗敎一貫的作了中心。無論宗敎是否有此能力’但編劇者苦心孤詣和超脫偉大的思想’都是不可埋沒的。而且内中對於農村的現象’是坦白的素描’的確’美國農村是這樣的’影片並沒離開現實。　　導演是一個很好的’能把劇本中一切所有的’充分展開’例如不呌惡人死’正又顯出了宗敎的寬大忠厚’赦宥已往’而與人們以改過自新的機會’在述事以外’小穿插很幽默的呌人發笑。中間馬車角逐互毆’也令人不禁爲其緊張起來’調劑了過份的宗敎嚴重性’不過技巧方面’未嘗沒有欠缺’尤其全片組織’過於平述’不容易呌人興奮。至於中間孤兒持槍’離惡人只一尺遠’而惡人不去搶他’未免不近情理’這是導演的疏忽吧？　　技巧一無可說’光線’攝影’佈景’收音’分幕’一切都只是那麽平淡。只有外景’取得很適當’不少大自然美的畫面。鏡頭動作’比較也算靈敏。對白嫌太多了’許多傳道式的話’呌人討厭’兩節聖詩唱得還算高雅。　　演員除了老人孤兒兩個以外’三個滑稽副角比較不錯。大寫太少’也是表情不動人’不深刻的一個原因。　　溜冰塲　　這是八年前卓别靈的著名作品’片長四千尺’當日哄動一時’現在配了音樂了。可是片中技巧的簡陋。動作的失常’呌人失笑；所謂的滑稽’幽默’只是些低下階級趣味的大跑大鬧’大打大跌而已。片子也　了太舊’所以中間斷漏很多。本事還算不錯’（比後台老板好得多）卓氏溜冰技能尚屬可觀。　　音樂非常的好’不用字幕’不用對白’一切由音樂去擔負’的確可以說生色的。更有許多因音樂作陪襯’反增加不少笑料’眞屬難能！　　馬路食堂　　也許有人以爲這是不重要的炭畫丨小副片丨而已’不過與其說炭畫’不如說音樂片適當些。優美的音樂’更有不受任何拘束所製成的滑稽片’當然另有風趣的’如果向這裏找事實’當然也不可能。不過有不少是人生萬物的象徵’這一張短片’唯一的長處’就是音樂’牠並不是引人笑’而牠竟能呌人有莫名的快感。在這三張片子中’大約以這張輕快音樂的炭畫’最受人歡迎些’所以我也順便介紹一下。觀衆意見「大進攻」觀後感  亞化　　「大進攻」在各報的大幅廣吿上’宣言「寸寸皆眞卷卷皆血」’但是「大進攻」的演出并沒有像廣吿那般說得眞。好像一塲飛船被毁’什麽人都看出那是模型製造的。而「大進攻」片子的本身’是由零碎的戰事新聞片集合而成’所以劇情不能統一’亦沒有中心的演員’有許多塲面’是使人難以明瞭的。　　「大進攻」是集「戰」的影片’那些軍隊的出發’大砲’衝鋒’和龐大的坦克車機關鎗’在觀衆看厭了男女愛情影片後’換一換口味是很投機的。好像那些傷兵的救護’難民’俘虜’葬禮’在那戰壕中流血的死的戰士和悽慘的戰地上死骸的「特寫」’很能使人覺得戰的恐佈丨凄楚。其中只有看到些歐洲的情形’和戰爭的實地的情形’沒有多大的情節’不過從中有幾節很悲壯的音樂’以及美國國歌的配唱’是很動聽的。　　戰爭的影片’大都是暗示戰争的殘酷的。但在現在華北的戰爭’事實上還未停止’我們觀「大進攻」以後’應激發我們衛國守土的雄心而不可稍生畏懼之心。關於「淸白」的一點小小批評  金代鍾　　「淸白」的内容和描寫’以及導演的技術’甚而至於各個演員的表情’我們已於前幾天的報紙上；看得詳盡無遺。但是’我還有一點小小的批評’並不重覆他們所說的’而是指出說明書和演員表示不符的漏洞。　　雖然由演員而他到銀幕上的’有一個姓蕭的畫師’但是’說明書裏並沒提及他是牲蕭。　　演員表裏有個閔德張飾的閔良’看遍了說明書’確實沒有這個人’雖不說是他臨陣脫逃’至少也要說一聲「先生不知何許人也」。　　我們看過了演員表有了楊父楊妻和銀幕上丈夫捉姦的一套’才知道琵琶原來姓楊。但是’說明書只說是「有一個丈夫的妻子和别人幽會去了’終於被丈夫找到’於是’她死在鎗彈之下」。我們看見他在牢獄托孤的一段’才認識他就是演員表中之所謂「楊父」。　　最後’我覺得酒店老板和醉漢是不能混爲一談的’明明在說明書裏載着一個醉漢’在演員表裏郤變成一個酒店老板了。　　這大槪都是作說明書者見缺縝密審查的緣故吧。（却酬）哭笑的代價  曉谷　　薛佛萊的新作ＡＢｅｄｔｉｍｅ　Ｓｔｏｒｙ一片裏’有一位十八個月的嬰孩演員。因他能夠縐起嘴唇學得薛佛來的風流的一笑’他就在十九個應試的嬰孩之中當選了。除了他應得的薪金外’另有一筆美金一千元的敎育費。　　　　	不久前在光陸蘭心同時開映的曼麗璧克福主演的「秘密」裏也有一個嬰孩演員。起先璧克福中意的另是一個’孰知那無藝術天才的小演員無端的大哭起來了’當擱了公司裏一天的工作’損失了七千美金’第二天他就被革退了。　　這兩位無知無識的嬰孩的一笑一哭的代價是美金七八千元’合華幣三四萬元。這個數目不知在我國能拍幾部鉅片好不好女人穿男人袴子　　女人穿男人袴子’現在在好萊塢眞是風靡一時了。但是到底怎麽樣？能不能永久盛行呢？據許多人的意見’那是不可能的。現在已經有人起來反對了。其中最公開反對的’就是亞道爾夫孟郁。他是影城裏衣着最講究的一位。他說「女人穿男人袴子’旣可笑’又愚笨’非但嬌揉造作’而且俗不可耐的。」「說他女人優美的曲線’難道是爲穿男人袴子而生的嗎？不是的。女人穿了男人袴子’一切的女性美都喪失了。」　　女人穿男人袴子的發起人’瑪琳黛德麗許在最近的歌舞片“Ｓｏｎｇｏｆ　Ｓｏｎｇ”中’曾穿了二十六套的新衣服’但是其中未曾有過一條男人袴子。可見她平時喜穿男人袴子’還沒有敢穿了男人袴子上銀幕也。電影小說女性之光Ｍａｅｄｃｈｅｎ　ｉｎ　Ｕｎｉｆｏｒｍ（七）  欣俯　　日耳曼影片公司出品全班女演員聯合主演　　事情壞了！不知道誰把這個消息’傳到校長跟前去了’校長怒氣衝天的跑進了大禮堂’那許多學生們’一看見校長的影子’一個個躡手躡脚的溜出去了’但是曼尼拉’她這時的神經是錯亂了；眼睛也糊塗了！她還在那裏跳來跳去的呼喊道··裴柏愛我！大家起來擁護裴柏呀！」校長看見這副形狀’氣得雙足向地上亂蹬’一在喊道··「她簡直瘋了！她簡直瘋了！這都是裴伯的過虚啊！」可是在校長暴跳如雷的時候’曼尼拉却暈倒地上了。　　等到曼尼拉悠悠醒轉’舉目四顧’却已置身在病房裏’她奇怪極了’對着坐在對面的看護婦說··「我頭痛呢’我是怎樣來到這裏的？」看護婦回’答她說··「我的小姑娘’你吃醉了·」正在這個時候’校長又闖進來了’怒指着曼尼拉駡道··「你簡直是人格掃地了’你應該受鞭撻’等一會你就知道怎樣受虚罰了’裴柏女士是永生永世不會忘却你的’」她說完了這兩句話’就忽忽的離去了’曼尼拉當然不岂說什麽’祗好含着涙兒自言自語道··「我究竟做錯什麽事呢？」　　裴柏得到了這個消息’就急忙跑到校長室去·校長看見裴柏’更加怒不可遏’她說；「我要不是因爲佛羅公主今天來參觀學校’我卽刻要將曼尼拉開除了·」裴柏說；「但是我對於這事的觀念’是完全不同的’我很知道孩子’我愛她們。」「所以你把襯衫送給她們。」校長這樣反問裴柏·裴柏答道··因爲曼尼拉缺少襯衫’並且這孩子是沒有母親的呀！愛的方式是很多的’曼尼拉並沒有犯什麽罪·」但是校長仍舊很堅執的說道··「這樣歲數的姑娘’是不能和她談愛情的·」裴柏見她無可理喻’祗得說一句··「讓我去安慰安慰她罷！」就馬上退出室外了·但是校長還在呶呶不休的說道··不許你和她再說話’我已經吩咐任何人都不能和她說話了。」（未完）</p>

<p>(Beiping) The problem in Chahar Province is still in progress. Feng's second circular has been drafted, containing three points: (1) Clarifying he is not a communist; (2) Not opposing the Central Government; (3) Having no contact with any factions. After this telegram is sent, the current situation in Chahar Province can be resolved. Feng stated that he does not want to be an official and will not go abroad. If everyone is sincere, cooperation is still possible, but he hopes for a solution for his troops. Currently, the military power of Feng's army is in the hands of Ji Hongchang, so Feng's problem is easier to solve. Ji's problem is more difficult. Fu's troops are moving towards the Ping-Sui Railway line, roughly stopping at Huailai for the time being. It has been decided that Song and Pang will preside over affairs as the Chahar Pacification Director. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Pang Bingxun is willing to preside over Chahar affairs and has notified his troops stationed in the camp areas near Tongzhou and Dongbianmen to begin preparing to leave for Zhangjiakou immediately after the official announcement. The Central Government hopes Feng will go to Beijing to take on the position of Training Director-General. It is heard that Feng's trip to Beijing is unlikely, and he no longer insists on dissolving the Allied Army. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) To stabilize the local situation in Chahar Province, the authorities have transferred the units of Pang Bingxun, Feng Qinzhai, and Fu Zuoyi to garrison the Ping-Sui Railway line. The units of Pang and Feng are gathering south of 囗囗, and Fu's unit is returning to the line from Zhangjiakou, Yanqing, to Changping. A certain division is now being transferred to fill the defense. (11th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Jia Deyao went to Tianjin this morning to meet Feng's friends in Tianjin to exchange mediation opinions. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fu Zuoyi went to Changping defense line yesterday with his secretary Wang Zeding to handle defense matters. He returned to Beiping by car at around 5 PM in the afternoon. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin, accompanied by Wang Lun and others, toured Jingshan this morning and hosted a banquet for generals such as Fu, Wan, and Pang at Jurentang at noon. (11th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e13">Central Finance Gradually Stabilizing <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Revenue and Expenditure Expected to Remain Balanced</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain financial official said that the national government is stationed in Nanjing, and the expenses are enormous. In addition, the internal wars and bandit suppression military expenses have also increased. In the past three or four years, domestic debts of no less than 600 million yuan have been raised and borrowed. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, not only has tax revenue been severely affected, but also the government's credit has been shaken. Fortunately, since last year, we have implemented streamlining of administration, strict austerity, rectification of tax collection, consolidation of public debt, postponement of interest reduction. The central government has not raised a single debt this year except for begging for American wheat for disaster relief. Although there are no accurate statistics on revenue and expenditure this year, it is expected that tax revenue, except for customs duties, which will be slightly shorter than last year due to the secession and retention of the four northeastern provinces, will be no less than last year for other taxes, such as salt tax, consolidated tax, tobacco and alcohol stamp tax, etc. As for the expenditure side, in addition to military expenditure, which has increased considerably due to the relationship between the anti-Japanese and bandit suppression forces, other items, such as party expenses and political expenses, have not changed significantly. Revenue and expenditure are still expected to remain balanced. If there are no major changes in the country in the future, the central finance will become more and more solid. The prices of domestic and foreign bonds have recently risen slightly, which is proof of this. (11th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Jiang Guangnai Clears Financial Procedures</p>
<p>Central Government Stipulates Monthly Salary with Additional Subsidies</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Fujian Pacification Commissioner's Office in Beijing said that after the government signed the North China Sino-Japanese Armistice Agreement, Jiang Guangnai and Cai Tingkai telegraphed to resist Japan. After the central government's explanation, they understood the central government's will and were determined to unite sincerely and consider the overall situation. The central government stipulates that the military salary in Fujian Province is 500,000 yuan per month, plus a special subsidy of 100,000 yuan per month during the bandit suppression period. In order to clarify financial procedures, Jiang Guangnai turns over all monthly revenue of about one million yuan from Fujian Province to the national treasury, without any interception or advance withdrawals. On one hand, he formally receives a monthly salary of 500,000 yuan from the Ministry of Military Affairs and a subsidy of 100,000 yuan from the Ministry of Finance. Therefore, in addition to legitimate taxes, there are no other miscellaneous taxes in the local area. In the past, opium poppies were everywhere in Fujian Province. As soon as the 19th Route Army was stationed, opium was strictly prohibited. Although it has not been eradicated in a year, it has been reduced by eighteen tenths, and the banditry has also been reduced. (11th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e22">Opening of the World Economic Conference <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Today, all major countries in the world, whether allies or enemies, have dispatched their first-class politicians and specialized committee members, totaling more than 2,000 representatives from 50-odd countries, to gather in London. Under the auspices of the King of England, they are holding the opening ceremony of the World Economic Conference. This conference was conceived at the Lausanne Conference in June of last year. The main purpose of that conference was to resolve war debts and German reparations. As a result, reparations were temporarily settled based on mutual concessions, with Germany paying 3 billion marks in the name of European recovery. However, the condition of resolving war debts was attached. Subsequently, the United States insisted on the different nature of war debts and reparations, and the US presidential election was also imminent, resulting in the failure to formally resolve the issue of war debt negotiations with the United States in the Lausanne Agreement. France and Italy originally planned to revise the war debts with the United States this March, but the sudden financial turmoil in the United States, which affected the whole world, interrupted this proposal. British Prime Minister MacDonald crossed the Atlantic to meet with Mr. Roosevelt to discuss the difficult situation of the world economy. France also sent former Prime Minister Herriot to the United States for negotiations. Nine other countries, including China, Germany, and Japan, were also invited to send representatives to discuss world economic problems with the US President. This was the prelude to the World Economic Conference, and it can also be said to be a movement of preliminary understanding between nations before the conference.</p>
<p>As for the agenda of the conference, according to the resolution of the Lausanne Conference on July 15, 1932, it can be divided into two parts. The first is financial problems, including currency and credit policies, eliminating difficulties in exchange rates of standard currencies, price levels, and capital movements. The second is economic problems, including improving the conditions for production and exchange, with particular attention to tariff policies, prohibitions and restrictions on imports and exports, and other commercial barriers, and agreements between producers. Whether these proposals will change after the opening of the conference is difficult to predict. Judging from the situation of the Washington Fireside Chats, even if the agenda is slightly changed, there will not be major differences in general. Although major countries such as Britain, the United States, France, Germany, and Italy each have different views and uphold their own interests, they all eagerly hope to negotiate a common point in order to restore the world economy from panic, which is inevitable.</p>
<p>After Britain abandoned the gold standard in September 1931, countries around the world successively banned the export of cash and abandoned the gold standard. Even the United States of America, which was called the gold standard country, stopped the gold standard in March of this year. As a result, international currencies suddenly presented a chaotic picture. In fact, the current financial situation in the world clearly shows a state of wartime economy. Countries are equally urgent. The task of the World Economic Conference will inevitably be to gather a majority of countries that have abandoned the gold standard and a very small number of countries that maintain the gold standard to jointly consider how to restore the gold standard system. If the gold standard system cannot be restored, then at least international exchange rates must be put back on a stable path, so that international economic relations can return to normal and cash can flow freely, and foreign capital can move freely. Furthermore, the loss of precious metal value of silver has greatly reduced the trade of silver-using countries, which has a great impact on world trade. Although there are problems with adopting a composite currency system, raising the price of silver is also an important measure to achieve currency stability. However, the implementation power of this plan is not as effective as simply redistributing cash. The lending relationship, financial flow, and trade turnover of the countries of the world are all its preconditions.</p>
<p>At present, the short-term debt of the capitalist international lending relationship is largely frozen, and the payment of interest on long-term foreign debt is also difficult. If we want to restore the international financial credit and make the international credit return to its previous normal state, the most important condition must be, as the countries such as Britain, the United States, and France want, to make the economic organization of the countries concerned safe, the exchange restrictions abolished, and the fixed resources circulate actively, and then there is hope.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the opportunity of the world's countries to discuss economic issues, raising prices is the common psychology of capitalist countries. At the very least, they will try their best to support the policy of reducing interest rates so that general businesses can develop soundly and prevent prices from falling again, which is also a harbinger of the world economic recovery. However, commodity prices are still low, and inventories have not decreased slightly. The implementation power of production control is still a question, and the total number of unemployed people in the world is disregarded by China's lack of statistics. Only the major countries in Europe, the United States, and Japan combined are already more than 30 million. With such a huge hidden danger, wanting to raise prices and ignoring the purchasing power of the general society is simply abandoning the root and pursuing the branches.</p>
<p>The revival of the international movement of capital, in other words, is to eliminate the chaotic state of the world economy today and re-establish normal financial relations between countries. The solution of short-term debt and the utilization of the Bank for International Settlements are all methods to promote the movement of capital. But whether it can be implemented effectively is questionable. Germany has just announced the cessation of payment of principal and interest on foreign debt, and all countries have deepened the economic panic, causing the industrial sector, which is the economic foundation, to be unable to operate. The financial organization at the upper level is naturally bound to become stiff. Even if it is carefully considered, the result is difficult to be optimistic. Tariff policy in economic issues is indeed the result of the current national advocacy of national self-sufficiency. The so-called international cooperation for rescue is to stop raising tariffs in a passive way, to reduce tariffs in an active way, and to re-order a reasonable tariff policy, or to make an international agreement at the Economic Conference, or to promote the governments of various countries to take autonomous actions. However, among the capitalist countries, Britain, the United States, France, Italy, Germany, and Japan each make "economic alliances." The Soviet Union has set up a separate portal outside the capitalist category. They are all opposed to each other. How can true coordination be possible? Therefore, Britain and Japan are politically allied countries, but the economic rift is obvious. France still adheres to its old policy of economic security and declares non-officially that those who are not beneficial to French trade will increase tariffs in retaliation. If so, the complete cessation of the tariff war is no easy task, and it is feared that it will be even more difficult to fundamentally revise the tax rules.</p>
<p>Therefore, today, in order to remove trade barriers, reduce the economic defenses set up by various countries, and make international trade return to the path of freedom, both exports and imports are not subject to prohibition and restriction, so as to alleviate the deepening of the world economic panic, or to promote the governments of various countries to take joint action and try to agree with producers. Not only take international coordination steps in trade, but also make the producers of various countries freely negotiate internationally on some production organizations such as wheat, timber, and coal, and conclude international agreements in order to open up the difficult situation of world economic panic. They are all a kind of utopian fantasy.</p>
<p>In short, the World Economic Conference is undoubtedly to support the shaking state of the capitalist economy and try to open up a new way out. In fact, it is based on the economic agreement of the three countries of Britain, the United States, and France as the standard, and then to harmonize the world economy and help the economic breakdown of various small countries. Except for Germany, other countries may be able to obtain a temporary economic stabilization under international harmony. However, the fundamental defects of the capitalist economic organization have not been resolved. The cancer of the world economic panic still exists. Then this World Economic Conference is nothing more than applying plasters to the cancer. Even if it is a small well-being, it is only temporary. As for the hope of full recovery, I dare not say that it will be realized.</p>

<p>(London) At the opening of the World Economic Conference, the British Monarch's address lasted approximately seven minutes, followed by the Prime Minister and Chairman of the conference, Ramsay MacDonald, whose address seemed to last no more than fifteen minutes.  General discussions then began. It is now proposed that each representative offer suggestions in their speeches, striving for practicality and avoiding empty rhetoric. It is said that this proposal came from MacDonald, as he wishes to conclude the conference's work as quickly as possible. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) The World Economic Conference, so eagerly awaited by the world, is scheduled to open on Monday. Its timetable has recently been made public. The British Monarch will arrive at the South Kensington Royal Geological Museum at 3:00 PM, where he will be greeted by Prime Minister and conference chairman MacDonald, and the new Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Avenol.  When the British Monarch delivers his opening address, all the representatives will stand.  The British Monarch's speech will last no more than seven or eight minutes.  Afterward, the British Monarch will take his seat, and translators will translate his speech into various languages.  Once the translation is completed, the British Monarch will leave the venue, and the audience will take a short break of several minutes. Then, the chairman will deliver an opening address. A magnificent golden podium has been set up in the conference hall, from which the British Monarch will speak, broadcasting via radio to all participating countries. Thus, the British Monarch's words will be heard by the world. Approximately 65 countries are participating. The British Monarch's opening address will be recorded using a high-speed, special recording method. His voice will be transmitted via radio waves to a location in London, where it will be recorded onto wax masters, which will then be sent to a factory to produce two copies of audio records. This process will take three hours.  Under normal circumstances, the production of audio records would take a day and a half. One copy will be submitted to the British Monarch for approval, and the other will be sent to the British Broadcasting Corporation for broadcast to various locations.  Major hotels in London have now become bustling hubs for delegates, experts, photographers, and journalists from various countries. It is estimated that approximately two thousand people have come to London for this conference.  The delegations from most of the 65 countries have already arrived. It is expected that everyone will be gathered in London by Sunday, the day before the conference opens. (Reuters, 11th)</p>

According to the agenda drafted by the conference's specialized committees, after the second reading, the conference may organize two or three committees to discuss matters separately. These committees will establish several subcommittees to discuss the details of the issues submitted. The authorities are now trying to avoid organizing unimportant bodies and are trying to ensure that the work of the conference can proceed quickly, so that the politicians who have come to England to serve as delegates can return to their countries as soon as possible.

<p>(Tokyo) Financial circles report that our country does not have many proposals for the World Economic Conference this time.  The more significant one is to contribute a plan for the recovery of global economic prosperity.  The narrower one concerns the relationship between China and the future of the world economy. In addition, the opinions from overseas Chinese, domestic industry, and the financial sector will be combined and summarized into one proposal. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3 id="e26">France's Attitude <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) After French Prime Minister Daladier won a 70% majority vote of confidence in the Chamber of Deputies yesterday, he is scheduled to depart from Paris on Sunday, accompanied by Minister of Finance Bonnet, Minister of Commerce Serre, Minister of Agriculture Queuille, and several experts, with the procedures for dealing with the World Economic Conference approved by his parliament. The French government considers the stability of currency to be an essential condition for France's continued commitment to the gold standard.  Therefore, it opposes currency devaluation, especially the artificial redistribution of gold.  Regarding tariff policy, France will reduce tariff barriers based on reciprocal measures. As for war debts, France still insists that the next payment must be the last, and not a mere accounting entry. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>(Paris) If the World Economic Conference cannot agree on an acceptable tariff agreement, the French government wants to ensure that domestic industry and agriculture receive complete protection.  Therefore, to prepare for emergencies, it submitted two bills to the parliament today to obtain emergency powers over tariffs. Their content is roughly similar to what the US government has obtained from Congress.  One bill authorizes the government to order the imposition of temporary surcharges to retaliate against countries that increase taxes. The other authorizes the government to change tax rates for already protected goods, especially when existing quotas change, so that tariffs can be adjusted accordingly. (Guomin Dian, 10th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Economic Conference will convene at 3:00 PM on the 12th. Under the objectives of economic peace, promotion of disarmament, feasible restoration of freedom of commerce, and increased purchasing power, the Japanese government will participate in the conference. In general, it will not adopt an active attitude and has decided to address the conference based on the following principles: Regarding the establishment of economic peace, efforts should be made to obtain guarantees of restraint from various countries in a substantive manner; abstract resolutions are preferred. Regarding general European treaties or agreements that may undermine the special position of the empire, reservations will be attached or opposition will be expressed. In principle, approval will be expressed for the unconditional most-favored-nation treatment treaty system. However, within the scope of not hindering economic peace between other countries, it is necessary to encourage the conclusion of reciprocal agreements between two or more countries with special relationships. The right of a country to counter dumping, economic aggression, and the retaliatory actions and self-defense measures of countries victimized by unreasonable high tariff policies is recognized as legitimate behavior.

<p>(Berlin) The German delegation to the World Economic Conference departed from Berlin for England tonight, totaling seven delegates. There are also numerous financial, economic, and industrial experts, representing the best of German talent. The chief delegate is the current Foreign Minister Neurath, who previously served as ambassador to London. Other leading delegates include current Finance Minister Schwerin, Minister of Economics Hugenberg, President of the German National Bank Schacht, Mayor of Hamburg Krogmann, renowned engineer and Member of Parliament Kloeber, and current Ambassador to England Hoesch. In addition, many senior officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Economics are also traveling. In addition to Schacht, there are three directors from the National Bank, all of whom have accompanied Schacht to meetings in New York, London, and Basel. As for the agenda that Germany intends to propose, according to reports in the newspapers, the most important matter is the prompt resolution of the German private debt problem. According to the German delegation's opinion, once this problem is resolved, all other problems can be readily solved, including the consolidation of important global monetary systems, such as the gold pound and the US dollar. The expansion of German exports and the reduction of tax rates are also related to this issue. (Guomin Dian, 10th)</p>
<h3 id="e29">Dutch Gold Policy <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Amsterdam. Recently, there have been rumors that the Netherlands may abandon the gold standard. According to local sources, the Dutch government's gold policy will depend on the outcome of the London World Economic Conference. There is considerable hope that the need for international understanding on currency is gradually becoming clear. In recent weeks, the Dutch National Bank has lost a significant amount of cash. In mid-April, its gold reserves totaled approximately one billion florins, but by the beginning of this month, due to cash exports, it had fallen to 825 million florins. Gold exports have now stopped. The bank's gold position remains very solid. The banknotes it issues are 89.4% backed by gold. Furthermore, it is now felt that the gold standard should still be maintained. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) The US delegate to the World Economic Conference, Morrison, stated here today that the United States absolutely does not believe that the US dollar can restore its gold standard. If it were restored, prices would fall dramatically to an unprecedented level. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3 id="e30">Observations from Various Parties <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>(London) European capitals are all paying the same attention to the London Conference. Berlin is somewhat pessimistic about it, believing that the scope of international problems is extremely broad and that the concepts and interests of the participating countries are very different from each other, making it almost impossible for the conference to proceed smoothly. However, Rome has an optimistic atmosphere. It is heard that the Italian delegates will do their best to advocate for the reduction of tariffs, the restoration of the gold standard for British and American currencies, and the abolition of exchange controls and trade quotas. According to recent dispatches from New York, New Yorkers seem to doubt any major results from the London Conference, as reconciling the uncertainty of currency inflation within the United States with a procedure that seeks to reduce tariffs or equalize the dollar based on methods acceptable to Britain and France is extremely difficult. Related to this, it can be mentioned that the exchange rate of the British pound has risen sharply in the past week, leading to rumors in Wall Street that the US government is now trying to suppress the dollar in order to encourage the export of American goods and support American farmers, who are once again showing unrest. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) This morning, newspapers discussed the Economic Conference, considering various issues one by one and speculating about the hope of the conference's success. Economic expert Sir Layton expressed his opinion in the News Chronicle, saying that US President Roosevelt had failed to obtain the necessary powers from Congress to negotiate tariff issues with other countries. The financial policy of the US government is still unknown. The attitude of Germany is the primary concern for the Economic Conference, and France also has considerable doubts about the resolution of war debt issues. As for Britain, it wavers between two extremes. On the one hand, it wants to expand British foreign trade, and on the other hand, most cabinet members believe in protectionist policies, resulting in a lack of initiative on economic matters. If the Economic Conference succeeds, it will only be because no one dares to imagine the consequences of its failure. We cannot resolve the current state of economic chaos in the world through compromises on some minor issues or resolutions expressing beliefs. (Havas, 10th)</p>

<p>(Washington) The accounts of the last-minute talks between Britain and the United States regarding the payment of war debts, as reported from London and Washington, differ slightly in content. However, it seems credible that Britain expressed to the United States its willingness to pay a portion of the installment payment and requested agreement. While the Secretary of State and the White House are unwilling to confirm these rumors, other government officials have indicated that British Ambassador Lindsay has made an informal proposal to pay a portion first. However, this proposal is still exploratory and awaits detailed discussion by the British Cabinet on Monday before a decision is made. Although there are external reports that the British government will pay the entire amount in silver, it is unlikely that there has been a concrete expression of intent to pay the full amount between the official circles of the two countries. According to someone claiming to be familiar with the talks between the State Department and the British Ambassador, the British proposed paying a portion first and using a combination of silver and US securities instead of paying cash. The White House stated that all suggestions are exploratory and indicated that Britain did not mention the amount to be paid or the ratio of silver and securities when suggesting partial repayment. The US side, because Congress has not yet completed deliberations on the various emergency bills and will not adjourn tonight, the situation has changed slightly. If the US President were to propose a bill now based on the British proposal, it would still be possible to consider it. Furthermore, since the British are the leader of the debtor nations, it is likely that Congress would be able to pass a partial payment plan, provided that there are no changes to the amount of the fundamental resolution. According to reports from London, Britain also seems willing to repay, but wants to minimize the impact on finance due to the imminent opening of the Economic Conference. (Guomin She Dian, 10th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, the State Department held a long meeting to discuss the war debt issue. Participants included President Roosevelt, the Undersecretary of State, and economic expert Professor Moley. Afterwards, the Undersecretary of State met with British Ambassador Lindsay and the Italian Ambassador. Subsequently, the British Ambassador went to the White House to meet with President Roosevelt and verbally expressed the British government's views on the war debt issue. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Late last night, British Ambassador to the United States Lindsay informed President Roosevelt of the British government's intentions regarding the war debt due on June 15, but did not offer any suggestions as a basis for starting negotiations to revise the war debts. The British debt due, even considering interest that cannot be deferred, amounts to $76,000,000. Britain only intends to repay four to five million dollars to show sincerity. Italy owes the United States $12,300,000, plus interest of $1,245,000, and also intends to temporarily pay around one million dollars, following the British approach. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Italian Ambassador to the United States Rosso declared to US Undersecretary of State Philipps that Italy would likely repay a portion of the war debt due on June 15. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt's plan to address the war debt issue after Congress adjourns has been thwarted. Congress today only extended the session until Sunday. Congress has raised objections to the President's sudden request for approval to reorganize government departments in order to save $25,000,000 in administrative expenses, and there is also opposition to raising funds for public works projects. According to the opinion of Democratic leaders, Congress can formally adjourn in the middle of next week. (Reuters, 10th)</p>

<p>(London) Japanese delegates attending the World Economic Conference and several key figures from the Japanese financial and business community met with the Director of the British Overseas Trade Bureau, Crowe, today to discuss the issue of Indian cotton textiles for several hours. Afterwards, a Japanese delegate told reporters that although Japan has not yet asked India to cancel the increased import taxes on cotton textiles, he feels hopeful of reaching an acceptable solution. It is heard that the Japanese delegates told Crowe that the Indian government's increase in import taxes on non-British cotton textiles may hinder the departure of Japanese textile industry representatives to England, causing their meeting with the Lancashire textile industry to be postponed. It was also said that he expects the tax rates increased by India will not be implemented before the current trade agreement expires on October 1, and proposed that if British and Japanese textile merchants reach a private agreement, the British government should guarantee its implementation. Crowe replied that the British government finds it difficult to guarantee the implementation of such agreements, especially because the relationship between the Lancashire textile industry group and the British government is different from the situation in Japan. The Japanese delegates reiterated that they are well aware of these difficulties. Afterwards, the Japanese delegate told reporters that he believes that textile merchants from both countries will be able to hold a meeting, and the result should please both governments. (Guomin Dian, 10th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Britain has launched a commercial attack on Japan from India, and the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is drafting concrete plans to respond, dividing them into two categories: fundamental countermeasures and emergency countermeasures. The main points are as follows: Regarding fundamental countermeasures: (1) Revise the current single tariff system, formulate a dual tariff rate system with maximum and minimum rates, and use this dual tariff system for economic defense. (2) For the application of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce, which does not grant unconditional most-favored-nation treatment to the British Empire, request that it be revised to apply only to the United Kingdom and its colonies, and negotiate separately with the autonomous territories of Canada, Australia, and South Africa based on reciprocity. Regarding emergency countermeasures: (1) Urge the United Kingdom and India to reflect on their actions. If this is ineffective, enact retaliatory tariffs by imperial decree in accordance with Article 4 of the Tariff Rate Law, effective immediately. (2) Implement retaliatory tariffs, and at the same time issue a diplomatic protest statement, urging them to reflect on their actions from a moral standpoint, and strive to mobilize international public opinion, consistently arguing that their actions are inappropriate.

<p>(Osaka) Regarding the follow-up arrangements for not buying Indian cotton, the Textile Federation held a special committee yesterday to discuss the results of the Textile Industry Association's plan, which has been completed.

<p>(Osaka) The Textile Luncheon Club held an emergency board meeting yesterday at the Cotton Industry Hall. As a result of the discussion, it was formally resolved that the Textile Industry Association's meeting to not buy Indian cotton is imminent, and the coordination must be consistent beforehand. Regarding the intention to expand production and reduce labor in the Kanto region, as a result of the discussion, it was unanimously agreed that expanding production, reducing labor, and increasing the market price of products is not permissible at this critical time, and therefore expressed opposition. (Dian Tong, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to news from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the fundamental principles for Japan's desire to sign a peace treaty with the United States have been decided, but its form and nature still need to be discussed. It is heard that Foreign Minister Uchida has telegraphed Representative Ishii in London to seek an opportunity to raise the US-Japan Arbitration Treaty case again with US Secretary of State Hull. Representative Ishii is scheduled to seek a meeting with Hull in the next day or two to discuss this matter. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been actively promoting pro-American sentiment in the past few days, with the aim of restraining Britain's anti-Japanese sentiment, which is the same as promoting the alliance with Russia at the time of the League of Nations meeting, and therefore the future of the US-Japan Arbitration Treaty is still difficult to predict.

<p>(Telegram from Yizhou One) To the Central Party Headquarters of Nanjing, the National Government, the ministries and commissions of various Yuan, the provincial and municipal governments, the commanders-in-chief of various units, the commanders of various armies, divisions, and brigades, the patriotic organizations, and the newspapers across the country: Since the September 18th Incident, we have gathered with five pains over the loss of our national territory and sympathized with the people suffering. We led the brave men of outside the pass to launch an uprising in Liaodong, raising the banner of resistance against Japan and restoring the counties of Liaodong. After years of bitter fighting, due to the exhaustion of ammunition and lack of support, we were forced to fight thousands of miles under the pressure of enemy forces, experiencing all kinds of hardships. The entire process of the war has long been understood by the people of the country. Now that our national crisis has not ended, our humiliation has not been avenged, the duty of soldiers has not been completed, and the responsibility of every citizen has not been fulfilled, we have long admired Commander He Suis enthusiasm for saving the country and his reputation. Last year, he rushed to the Rehe border, guiding the righteous troops. Not only the comrades in the border area heard the news and came to join him, but also the people inside the lost territory still remember him with gratitude. In addition to the work within Liaoning and Rehe, there are still thousands of people in Ju Wu's unit who have followed him into the pass, willing to listen to Commander He's command and obey the orders of the Central Government. Ju Wu and others recall the process and dare not slacken in the slightest. We hope that our compatriots and gentlemen will understand.

<p>(Telegram from Yizhou Two) Since the September 18th Incident, the enemy has invaded our inland, devastated our compatriots, and the country is in danger. The people are shaken. Zhen Guodeng has taken the responsibility of every citizen for the rise and fall of the country, and gathered more than 10,000 brave men outside the pass, fighting for years and experiencing hardships. One falls, another rises; their will has not diminished. They have successively captured famous cities, and their righteous voice has spread throughout the country. Later, due to the lack of ammunition and the interruption of supplies, they retreated to the Rehe border. Now they have led their troops to concentrate in Yixian. They are pleased to meet Commander He Sui again, who has been re-appointed to lead the army. Zhen Guodeng and others have long admired Commander He's virtue and prestige, and the dozens of battles outside the pass were all personally commanded by the Commander, with outstanding achievements. Now that he has assumed a difficult task, Zhen Guodeng and others are willing to sincerely support him and obey his command. From now on, they will resolutely abide by the orders of the Central Government and follow Commander He's orders, taking the lead even if it means facing boiling water and fiery flames. This unwavering loyalty can be witnessed by heaven and earth. This telegram conveys our heartfelt wishes, hoping for your understanding. [Signed] Peng Zhenguo kowtows (10th) (seal).</p>
<h3 id="e60">The Future of Philippine Independence <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Internal Opinions Divided into Six Types</p>
<p>National News Agency, Manila, 11th - The battlefield of the Philippine independence movement has shifted from Washington to Manila after the return of two delegations to the island today. One delegation, led by Senator Osmena and House Speaker Roxas, brought back the Philippine Independence Act passed by the US Congress. It is reported that they will publicly persuade the Philippine Congress to accept the act. The other delegation, led by Senate President Quezon, rushed to Washington after the passage of the act to inquire about the opinions of US congressmen and whether they could offer a more favorable bill. It is reported that Quezon had private talks with senators and representatives in the US and felt quite disappointed with his aspirations. Both delegations arrived here today on the Empress of Japan. The Osmena delegation returned directly to the Philippines from the US, while the Quezon delegation took a detour through Europe and met in Hong Kong before returning on the same ship. The Mott group organized a parade with military bands to welcome them at the pier, and then escorted the two delegations on a parade through the streets. The number of participants was no less than 200,000, and the enthusiasm was unprecedented. After the parade, Quezon told people that he did not want to express his attitude towards the independence act before consulting with the leaders of the legislature. He personally opposed the act, but would not make any suggestions until after consultation. Roxas believed that he had obtained the most favorable independence act possible within the realm of possibility and should not reject it. US congressmen had clearly told him that if the Filipinos rejected the act, they would be considered unwilling to be independent. Whether the Filipinos can accept the act is still uncertain. However, because the fate of the Philippines will be decided in the coming days, the atmosphere is very tense. At present, there are about six forces within the Philippines that can influence the independence act: (1) The natural nationalistic aspirations of the Filipinos; (2) The political fate of the leaders, because they often use the independence issue as a tool for political struggle; (3) Those who sincerely oppose the current form of the independence act; (4) The Philippine sugar industry is like being between two lovers, hoping for independence on the one hand, but unwilling to give up free exports to the US on the other hand; (5) The uncertainty of the future of the Far East disputes; (6) The psychology of most merchants, fearing that political independence will harm the economy and believing that complete political independence is not necessary for the development of Philippine nationalism. However, given the different opinions of the two delegations today, whether the independence act is accepted or not, it may lead to a split in the Nationalist Party. Quezon holds a large part of the power in the party, but if the Congress fully accepts the act, it may lead to Quezon's loss of power, and the rise of new leaders Osmena and Roxas. If the integrity of the party is to be maintained, the only way is to adopt a compromise, accept the act, but attach reservations, and return the independence issue to the US Congress.</p>

<p>Saito Seeks Opinions from Cabinet Members</p>
<p>Decision Made After Discussion with the Finance Minister</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 11th - Prime Minister Saito, under the pretext of emergency, is implementing an increase in the prices of postage stamps, postcards, and cigarettes to increase government revenue. After considering the tax-bearing capacity of the people, he intends to slightly increase tax revenues. Secretary-General Horikiri visited each cabinet member to solicit their opinions. The ministers of Army, Navy, and Railways believed that an increase might be unavoidable when necessary if the timing and method were appropriate, so the government will conduct a concrete investigation by the Tax System Reform Preparation Committee. After obtaining the understanding of Finance Minister Takahashi, a meeting of relevant cabinet members will be held to determine the tax increase policy.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Washington, 10th - The US Navy Department has changed its austerity plan again. It now plans to have ships enter dry dock in rotation for three months of overhaul, and part of the repair work will be done by soldiers. Chief Historian Hwang-sheng estimates that about 20% of the repair work can be undertaken by soldiers and sailors. In addition to the summer maneuvers, all target practice and maneuvers will also be temporarily suspended for some time to save money. This summer's maneuvers will cost less because they will be held in Puget Sound without long-distance voyages. Under the current budget, the number of active-duty naval personnel must be reduced to 77,000, and all non-essential expenses will not be further saved.</p>

<p>Reuters, Vienna, 10th - It is widely rumored here that Hungarian Regent Horthy, Admiral of the Fleet, may be granted powers equal to those of a king by the parliament. Royalists are now actively promoting the restoration of King Otto, and advocating for propaganda among the lower classes. Previous royalists focused on the aristocracy and the upper and middle classes. Austrian royalists have frequently visited Hungary in recent weeks, and it is said that a compromise has been reached with Hungarian friends on the restoration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. However, Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös, an opponent of royalism, still firmly believes that the restoration issue is not timely. Today, it is claimed that the government plans to submit a bill to the parliament to greatly expand the powers of the head of state. If the bill is passed, the hope of Otto's restoration in the near future will be completely extinguished.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Vienna, 11th - The cabinet meeting passed an emergency decree authorizing the government to order the suspension or prohibition of the publication of any newspaper in Austria that publishes or disseminates news that endangers the existence of the current government, for a period of two days to one year. The order has been initially implemented against the Munich German National Socialist Party's organ newspaper, prohibiting its distribution in Austria for one year.</p>

<p>Havas, Paris, 10th - Austrian Ambassador to France Gondre visited Finance Minister Bonnet, and then met with Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour. The discussion was probably about the Geneva Protocol of July 1932, which stipulated that France would guarantee an Austrian loan of 75 million schillings (Austrian currency).</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 10th - The National Socialist Party's news agency published an article criticizing Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss's pro-French policy, saying that this policy is economically unfortunate for Austria. It also stated that the Austrian government has adopted a dictatorial political system to deal with the National Socialist Party. "The situation within Austria is serious and tense." The people have been resentful for a long time. A slight disturbance can explode. At that time, the Austrian government will only be able to watch helplessly and will be unable to resist.</p>

<h3 id="e67">The Uncertain Japanese Political Situation (Japan Communications) <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Signs of a Split in the Seiyukai</p>
<p>The Saito Cabinet Will Not Last Long</p>
<p>Japanese politics, on the one hand, hangs the big sign of a united cabinet, and on the other hand, says that the cabinet is weak and strongly advocates strong leadership. In fact, the current Japan, like other imperialisms, is full of contradictions and has no way to solve them itself. For example, taking the three eastern provinces, the initial opinion of the military was that although fundamental construction would require a considerable period of time to lay the foundation, the current unemployment problem could be relatively solved. However, the number of unemployed people reduced in Japan is only 20,000 less than last year according to official figures. In reality, there are at least 2.5 million unemployed people in Japan. In its own country, major cities are filled with unemployment panics, and the plight of rural areas has not been alleviated. The cry of "recession" is only suppressed by the transformed war. Even looking at the situation in the three eastern provinces, in cities such as Shenyang, Changchun, and Harbin, Japanese people are looking for work, and all the hotels are full. They cannot get a decent position for a while. Even if they try their best to exclude the Chinese and the small ghosts who have naturalized in the puppet state, it is not enough to accommodate their educated intellectuals. As for agricultural immigrants, they will probably not be able to achieve any results due to climate restrictions, product differences, and different customs. The more it expands its military operations, the more the general social wealth is exhausted. Most Japanese people with real knowledge know this, but few dare to look directly at the current situation and expose it. Aside from the revolutionary parties engaged in underground movements, because Japan's constitutional politics are originally very empty, the power of capitalists, although not small, cannot overcome the barbarity of bayonets. The cabinet is not responsible to the parliament, and the military has the special privilege of reporting to the emperor. In the Osaka municipal election, only 55% of those with the right to vote voted. The general indifference to so-called constitutional politics has been fully expressed.</p>
<p>This is why the Japanese political turmoil has been going on for so long and has not shown any meaning at all. It is not that the Saito cabinet has any policies worthy of the people's support, enabling the masses to rise up to defend it, nor is it that Saito himself has any special skills to overcome the current contradictions, nor is it that a truly united cabinet can subdue everything. So, what is the reason why the Saito cabinet, which has been clamoring for nearly half a year to fall, has not yet fallen?</p>
<p>First, the parties in the cabinet-toppling group themselves have no power. The Minseito Party can be regarded as a quasi-government party. The Kokumin Domei is too small to mention. The Seiyukai has 300 members, occupying an absolute majority in the parliament. If it truly upholds constitutional politics, severs ties with the current government and the military, and strives for political struggle, not only would the Saito cabinet fall, but the military would also have to yield to the masses. However, the Seiyukai does not have a political program and policy that can truly open up the situation and seek the welfare of the masses. General Japanese public opinion, from left to right, is dissatisfied with the actions of the established political parties, thus affecting the parliamentary political system.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Seiyukai itself is not sound. The disputes over political programs and policies are not very large. In essence, it is still a dispute over personal relationships. For example, in this cabinet-toppling movement, the Seiyukai, apart from a few platitudes, does not have any clear political movement sufficient to surpass the current cabinet. At the same time, the party itself is divided into at least two major factions. Those who strongly advocate toppling the cabinet call themselves the "hardliners," including Katsuta Kazue, Ogawa Heikichi, Yamamoto Teijiro, Kawamura Takeji, Shimada Toshio, Yamaguchi Giichi, etc., and are attached to the "Nirokukai" under the command of Mori Kaku. They advocate immediately ordering Seiyukai cabinet members to resign, expressing their severance from the current cabinet, establishing their own political program, and advancing rapidly towards constitutionalism. The so-called "self-respect faction" in the Kyushu region has the Tokonami Takejiro faction and the Akita Kiyoshi faction. In Kanto, there are Hatoyama, Maeda, etc., and in Hokkaido, there is Kinoshita Kenjiro, etc. The Mitsui zaibatsu also tends to favor the self-respect faction. They believe that the Saito cabinet has a life span of at most one year, and the Seiyukai should wait for it to mature and then replace it. They should temporarily endure and respect themselves now, and take a monitoring attitude towards the government. These two factions have started an obvious split movement from a secret struggle. Now they are each gathering their own factions of parliamentarians and are discussing countermeasures separately. If the Seiyukai is split in two, the cabinet-toppling will naturally be powerless.</p>
<p>Second, the military is doing its utmost to maintain the status quo and advocating for the extension of the emergency period. Araki even publicly stated that "severance theory" is not worth considering and insisted on the united cabinet theory. He also advocated that Suzuki join the cabinet. Therefore, the people in the Seiyukai who advocate self-respect dare not have any objections and reluctantly accommodate the status quo. However, with the Seiyukai itself陷於divided, Suzuki cannot lead it, and others are afraid that it will be difficult to clean up. The established political parties in Japan are from now on the setting sun going down the mountain, and it is difficult to rise again and play a strong political role. (June 4, 1933, in Tokyo)</p>
<h3 id="e68">The Infiltration of Japanese and Puppet Troops into Chahar Province Intensifies <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Army Concentrates in Dolon to Cut Off Zhangku Transportation</p>
<p>Liu and Cui and Other Rebels Actively Invade Western Parts of Chahar; Zhangbei is Tense. The Central Government Seeks a Peaceful Resolution with Feng. Special Dispatch from Beiping: Japan's plan to seize Chahar Province was a predetermined plan. With the end of the Great Wall War, Zhang Yuan raised the banner of resisting Japan. The process of seizing Chahar is accelerating. Since the first of this month, the Chahar-Japanese and puppet troops have been actively moving, gradually penetrating deeper. In order to avoid direct deployment, the Japanese army is purely adopting the poisonous scheme of controlling China with Chinese, using Chinese traitors such as Liu Guitang, Cui Xinwu, Zhang Haipeng, and Tang Yulin as accomplices, leading the rebel army and acting as the vanguard, while they themselves are in a supervisory position. In addition to dispatching a part of officers to supervise and command in various rebel units, the main Japanese army is concentrated in Dolon, issuing instructions and commands. If the rebel army advances, they will follow closely behind. In recent days, the Japanese army in western Rehe has been successively concentrating towards Dolon and Guyuan. A part of the Motegi cavalry has gone to the vicinity of the Zhangku automobile road, attempting to cut off Zhangku transportation. Liu Guitang, Cui Xinwu, and other rebel units have invaded Baochang and Kangbao, and are now actively deploying to prepare to continue their western invasion. The Zhang and Tang rebel units in the Guyuan area have begun to move, approaching Dushikou. Although there has not yet been contact between Zhangbei and Dushikou, the situation is extremely tense. Zhao Chengshou's cavalry unit of the Jin army was originally stationed in the Zhangbei area. Since Feng Yuxiang took office, he has transferred the Zhang Lisheng and Nie Yuling units to be stationed there. Zhao's unit has been ordered to go to Xinghe to join the Li Fuying unit of the Jin army stationed in Chaigoubu for joint defense. Several lines of defense have been built from Zhangjiakou to Zhangbei, and trenches have also been dug near Zhangyuan. Zhangbei is 125 li from Zhangyuan, and Kangbao is more than 80 li east of Zhangbei, only about 200 li from Zhangyuan. Therefore, since the rebel army captured Kangbao, Zhangyuan has felt threatened, and the situation has become increasingly tense. After Fang Zhenwu's unit arrived in Xuanhua, in addition to leaving Bao (Gang)'s division stationed in the Xuanhua area, Zhang (Renjie)'s division was transferred to Dushikou for garrison. This place is located south of Guyuan and north of Chicheng, and is the only important pass along the Great Wall outside the pass. The mountains are steep, and only one line can pass through, so the situation is extremely dangerous. Fang is deeply concerned that the Japanese rebels may advance towards this place, and is worried that the strength of the troops is weak, so he has transferred a part of Bao's division to reinforce. The volunteer armies in the northeast of Zhangbei and Dushikou have now been transferred to other places. Feng Zhanhai is currently in Yuxian and Zhuolu. The old units of Ma Zhanshan, Deng Wentan, and the new units of Li Zhongyi have withdrawn from Chahar and concentrated in the Pingdiquan area for reorganization. West of Zhangyuan, the Li Fuying unit of the Jin army in the Chaigoubu and Tianzhen area has established defenses step by step along the railway, and the Sun Chu unit is deployed in Datong, Fengzhen, and other places.</p>
<p>Since Feng took office in Zhangyuan, all his actions have attracted the attention of all parties. The Central Government is trying all kinds of methods to resolve the Chahar issue. Pingfang has also convened several meetings to discuss the solutions in detail. Everyone believes that Feng has a deep history in the party and the country. At this time of national crisis, we always seek a peaceful path to overcome the difficulties together. Pingfang had previously sent personnel to Chahar for negotiations. Feng also had representatives come to Pingfang to express his attitude, hoping that Pingfang would still bear full responsibility for the military affairs of Chahar Province. At the same time, Song Zheyuan is also willing to take the initiative. Today (the 10th), a representative has been sent to Zhangyuan. There may be a considerable solution in the coming days.</p>
<p>In addition, Feng will issue another telegram to clarify the misunderstandings from the outside world since he took office. The main points are: (1) He has not allied with the Communists. (2) He will never fight internally. (3) The changes in the officials of Chahar Province were because Zhangyuan was once tense, and most of the original officials left their posts. He had to send personnel to maintain order first, and had no intention of seizing territory. If the Japanese army invades and the Central Government has a whole plan to resist, he will not hesitate to resign. The Central Government's plan for Chahar Province is to adopt the principle of 30% military and 70% politics. Some people here hope that Feng will temporarily leave Zhang, but it is unknown what Feng intends. (June 10th)</p>
<h3 id="e69">The Problem of Puppet Troops Still Has No Solution <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Deliberately Delay Withdrawal</p>
<p>Traitors Are Secretly Assisted by the Japanese Side and Request Reorganization</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Beiping: Although the Japanese army has started to withdraw, the withdrawal is extremely slow due to various problems. There are two main reasons: (1) Although the Japanese side stated that it would not interfere with the puppet troops in the war zone, they have been sheltered by them and it is difficult to decisively abandon them. Moreover, there are still many places to use them in the future, so they cannot destroy their tools themselves. Before the puppet troop issue is completely resolved, they deliberately delay their departure. (2) The weather is rainy, the roads are muddy, and transportation is difficult. This withdrawal is to first withdraw the heavy artillery and baggage, and then mobilize the infantry in the rear. The troops in the front are withdrawn in sequence. Now the heavy artillery and baggage have been withdrawn, and some of the infantry in the rear have also been withdrawn. The Japanese army east of Tongzhou has withdrawn to Sanhe County last night (the 9th). In the withdrawn areas, the military authorities stationed near Tongzhou will temporarily send a part of the security team to maintain local order. Once the special police are formed, they will go to take over. The Japanese army on other lines is also preparing to withdraw. Generally, they can be withdrawn one after another in the coming days.</p>
<p>Regarding the puppet troop issue, the Japanese representative Okamura stated when he met with our representative in Tianjin that he would listen to our disposition. The detailed plan will be answered after consulting with Commander Muto of the Kwantung Army in Changchun. However, many days have passed since he left, and there has been no reply. Yesterday, they unofficially stated that it would be best for our side to reorganize the puppet troops in the war zone and temporarily station them in their original locations. The puppet troops are also strongly requesting reorganization. Our side originally advocated a thorough solution. Now that the situation has changed, it may be difficult to achieve. Therefore, in recent days, we have no longer insisted on opposing the reorganization. However, after the reorganization, they must be transferred and reorganized separately. If they are still stationed within the war zone, the hidden dangers will be endless and it is impossible to promise. To this day, the matter is still in a stalemate. It is worth noting how it will be resolved in the future. The Japanese army has gradually withdrawn, and there are many difficulties with the puppet troops blocking the way during the handover. The authorities are extremely anxious about this and are working hard to compromise in order to obtain a proper solution in the shortest possible time. (10th)</p>
<h3 id="e70">Southwest Anti-Japanese Troops Ordered to Return After North China Armistice <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Nineteenth Route Army Advance Contingent Returns to Fujian via Lianping</p>
<p>Guangdong-Guangxi Anti-Japanese Units Turn into Southern Jiangxi to Suppress Communists Guangzhou Dispatch: Since the signing of the North China armistice agreement, the anti-Japanese movement has suddenly subsided. Consequently, the anti-Japanese troops that had set out from the southwest were also forced to halt their advance. The Nineteenth Route Army's anti-Japanese troops in southern Hunan were ordered on the 3rd of this month to return to Fujian. The Guangdong and Guangxi anti-Japanese forces will turn into southern Jiangxi to suppress the Communists. According to recent news from the Nineteenth Route Army's front lines, the First and Second Columns had already begun their return journey from Chenzhou to Shaoguan on the 5th of this month. They will take the route through Shaozhou, bypassing Wengyuan, Lianping, and Heping, and return to their defense positions via Meixian. They have also telegraphed the rear, requesting the recruitment of qualified medical personnel to serve with the army. All ration bags, water bottles, pack animals, and recovered soldiers must be sent to Shaoguan before the 10th to join the return to Fujian. The return-to-base telegram of the First and Second Column Commanders is appended below: "We have received a telegram from our Commander-in-Chief Cai stating that our anti-Japanese troops are purely acting with sincere intentions to save the</p>
<p>country and have no other motives. Unexpectedly, while the troops were en route, the North China authorities made a pact of surrender under the city walls. We order the Chief of Staff, etc., to lead their troops to endure the pain and return to Fujian to plan for national salvation," etc. Upon receiving this order, and considering that the flames of Japanese aggression are spreading and the national crisis is becoming increasingly urgent, Yan, etc., uphold the spirit of resistance to Japan and hope to fulfill the responsibility of saving the country. Therefore, they led the vanguard to brave the difficulties and advance. Just as the soldiers were trekking forward, the order to return to base arrived one after another. This advance contingent complied and, with pain, returned to defense on June 5th. The back-and-forth movement caused disturbance, and we feel deeply ashamed. We present our case with humility and trepidation. Zhang Yan, Commander of the First Column of the Nineteenth Route Army's Support-Heat Advance Contingent, and Tan Qixiu, Commander of the Second Column, along with all the officers and soldiers, respectfully salute." Furthermore, Cai Tingkai telegraphed Chen Jitang, stating that the Sino-Japanese truce has become a reality. In addition to informing brother Deng Jianquan (Longguang)'s unit to return to your command, he also instructed our advance contingent to take the route along the Guangdong border during the day to return to Fujian, etc. It has been learned that Deng Longguang's First and Second Regiments have already arrived at Lechang Pingshi, and the Third Regiment has also arrived at Guitou, etc. Recently, due to the order to return to base mid-journey, they will await orders in the Lechang area. After the Nineteenth Route Army's advance contingent returns to Shaozhou and detours through Wengyuan, they will be gradually transferred back. At that time, it is possible that they will participate in the suppression of Communists in Jiangxi. As for the vanguard unit of the 24th Division of the Guangxi anti-Japanese army, the Ling Yaxi Regiment, after arriving in Shaozhou on the 31st of last month, it has now been decided that the regiment will not go to the Hunan border because the Nineteenth Route Army's advance contingent has returned to base. Currently, they have been ordered by their military commander to change course and head to Nanxiong to cooperate with friendly forces in Jiangxi to suppress Communists. After receiving the order, the regiment departed from Shaozhou Dongheba at 10:00 AM on the 4th, taking the Shaonan Highway by motor vehicle, and headed towards Nanxiong. (June 6th)</p>

Wang Delin, Commander-in-Chief of the Northeastern National Army, Kong Xianrong, Deputy Commander-in-Chief, and Zhang Dianjiu, Deputy Commander of Su Bingwen's unit, etc., also arrived in Hong Kong on the postal ship "Salobogen" at 3:00 PM on the 5th of this month. Wu Yushu, Commander of Haman, Wang Erzhan, Commander of Hulun Security, Xie Ke, Chief of Staff of the Jiang Province Military Headquarters, and Han Liru, Director of the Jiang Province Department of Civil Affairs, etc., took the original ship to Shanghai on the same day. However, Wang Delin, Kong Xianrong, and Secretary Liu Huanran, due to the warm welcome from representatives of Guangdong, took a special trip to Guangdong. Accompanying them were representatives of the Volunteer Army, Liang Detang, and Xu Jiesan, Deputy Commander of the Northeast Route, etc., who arrived in Guangdong on the Hong Lun "Taishan" at 6:00 AM on the 6th. Upon learning of Wang's arrival in Guangdong, representatives from Guangdong's party, military, political, and civilian organizations, numbering several hundred, gathered at the pier to welcome them that morning. As soon as Wang Delin and others disembarked, representatives from all walks of life rushed forward to shake hands. Huang Wenkwan, a member of the Volunteer Army Association, introduced them one by one to Generals Wang and Kong. Generals Wang and Kong were dressed in white summer cloth gowns, appearing very simple and in high spirits. Shortly after, Xiang Hanping, the Second Army Commander of Guangdong Province (and a guiding committee member of the Guangdong Province Aid Volunteer Army Association), led Wang, Kong, and others to the Tuisiyuan in Dongshan for rest. At 12:00 PM, the Southwest Political Affairs Council held a banquet to welcome Wang, Kong, and others. Those present included Chen Jitang, Xiang Hanping, Deng Zeru, Xiao Focheng, Zou Lu, Lin Yunguai, Liu Jiwen, and others from the military and political circles. During the banquet, Xiang Hanping introduced the brief histories of Wang, Kong, and others. The guests and hosts had a pleasant conversation until around 2:00 PM when it ended. In the evening, the Southwest Executive Department also held a banquet to entertain them. According to Wang, his troops in the Northeast engaged in close combat with the Japanese enemy. He believes the situation is known domestically. After his unit raised the banner of righteousness in Yanji and Dunhua, they discovered that the Japanese were planning to occupy the Jihui Railway for military and industrial development. Therefore, they made every effort to sabotage the Japanese army's plans. The Japanese also knew that his unit was a formidable enemy and spared no effort to suppress them with heavy troops. To avoid significant losses, his unit retreated to the second line of defense, relying on mountains and dangerous terrain to contend with the violent Japanese. His army had a Forward General Headquarters, a Battle Supervision General Headquarters, a Northeast Route Headquarters, a Left and Right Route Headquarters, and guerrilla units, etc., with a tight organization, often inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. At present, there are still more than 100,000 troops, distributed in fourteen counties in the eastern part of Jilin. Due to environmental factors, he was forced to retreat into Russian territory with Chairman Ma Zhanshan and Commander Su Bingwen. His troops were temporarily handed over to Wu Yicheng, the front-line Commander-in-Chief, and Zhang Yuting, the Commander. After they retreated into Russian territory, they took the Siberian Railway to Moscow, passing through Poland, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy, before taking a boat from Italy back to the country. They are grateful for Guangdong Province's welcome and will stay for a few days before returning to their defense areas to reorganize their units and fight the Japanese to the death again. He (Wang referred to himself) is fifty-nine years old. Since he was in his twenties, he came to the three northeastern provinces from his native Shandong and has been living a military life for decades. A soldier's duty is only to save the country and protect the people. This time, upon returning to his defense, he will continue to fight, with the ultimate goal of recovering lost territory. Even if only one soldier remains, he will fight to the death with the enemy on the battlefield. His unit has enough firearms for now. However, they are in short supply of ammunition. The purpose of his visit is (1) to thank all sectors for their previous enthusiastic support of the Volunteer Army, and (2) to hope that Guangdong Province will continue to provide ammunition and pay to the Volunteer Army so that they can fight a desperate battle with the enemy. It is learned that Wang and others will stay in Guangdong for about four or five days, visiting famous sites in Guangdong Province, before returning north. At noon on the 7th, the provincial and municipal governments will host a banquet for Wang at Qixiulou. People from all walks of life will hold a welcoming rally at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall at 3:00 PM on the 7th to formally welcome them. (June 6th)</p>
<h3 id="e72">Tianjin's Preparedness Remains Strict <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>(Japanese Plainclothes Team Rampage in Tanggu)</p>
<p>The situation in Tianjin has become tense again in recent days. The curfew time in the Chinese Concession, which was extended from 9:00 PM to 10:00 PM starting on the 6th, was unexpectedly temporarily restored to its original time the next day. All the preparations in the Japanese Concession have not been removed. Yesterday (the 8th) morning, the Japanese army conducted exercises at Haiguang Temple, and clear gunfire could be heard in the French Concession and other places. The serious situation has not diminished slightly. Last night (the 8th), a Japanese merchant ship in Tanggu, carrying more than 70 plainclothes team members, docked near the Japanese barracks. Two of the plainclothes team members, holding hands, threw two hand grenades in front of the barracks gate and then fled. Our side negotiated for extradition, but no results were obtained. This morning (the 9th) around 8:00 AM, a Japanese aircraft flew to Tanggu and Dagu for reconnaissance before leaving. A Japanese aircraft was also spotted in Tongzhou this morning, conducting reconnaissance for a week before flying east. At the same time, two Japanese aircraft flew to Beijing for reconnaissance over the city, scattering leaflets with unclear content. (9th)</p>
<h3 id="e73">He Chengjun Departs for Hubei to Inspect <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Liu Zhenhua Telegraphs that a General Suppression Order Will be Issued Upon Arriving at Huangchuan He Jian Telegraphs Wuhan Seeking Instructions on the Strategy for Suppressing Bandits in Southern Hubei Hankou Dispatch: He Chengjun, the Pacification Commissioner stationed in Hubei, was previously ordered to be stationed in Hankao to preside over the military affairs of bandit suppression on all fronts. To understand the bandit situation and the actual conditions in various places, He decided to go on inspection tours in stages. It was originally planned to go to eastern Hubei first, then to central and northern Hubei. Recently, the itinerary has been changed to go to central Hubei first. On the 10th, He entrusted the affairs of the Pacification Headquarters to Chief of Staff Yang Kuiyi, Chief Counselor Zhu Chuanjing, and Office Director Chen Guangzu to handle jointly before departing on a special vessel with his entourage. It is planned to go from Xindi to Tianmen and then return by boat, changing to a car to inspect eastern and northern Hubei. Before He departed, Liu Zhenhua, the Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression in the Henan-Hubei-Anhui Border Area, telegraphed that he had arrived in Huangchuan on the 10th and had completed the deployment of the bandit suppression troops and would issue a general suppression order on schedule. He would also establish reform institutions to provide relief and reformation to the people in the bandit areas. After Liu arrived in Huangchuan, Wei Lihuang's and Chen Jicheng's units had already handed over their responsibilities and were now heading south in batches to Jiangxi and Hubei. Chen's unit is concentrating in Xinyang and will come to Wuchang to await orders. Wei and Liu have both gone to Jiangxi to meet Jiang first. Furthermore, according to a telegram from He Jian, the Commander-in-Chief of the Fifth Route Army in the Western Provinces, the bandit suppression in southern Hubei is about to begin. He requests He to instruct the strategy. Chen Quzhen's unit of the Western Route Army, which is responsible for assisting bandit suppression in western Hubei, has also arrived at the designated location for concentration. Chen sent personnel to Wuhan on the 10th to report to the headquarters and pacification headquarters and to request the issuance of bandit suppression funds to facilitate the suppression. (10th)</p>
<h3 id="e74">The Rising of Jianghan Water Levels Continues <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Central and Local Governments Continue to Pass the Buck on Flood Prevention Responsibility The Provincial Party Department and the Provincial Government Telegraph the Authorities to Argue Forcefully Hankou Dispatch: Since Commander-in-Chief Jiang issued an order to abolish the Hubei Provincial Water Conservancy and Embankment Engineering Bureaus, all embankment engineering funds have been handed over to the National Economic Commission for safekeeping. The embankment repair project is the responsibility of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, and the provincial government authorities have not intervened at all. Recently, the Jiang River has risen sharply, and the situation is dangerous. At this time, the National Economic Commission drafted the Jianghan Main Embankment Flood Prevention Measures, assigning the responsibility for flood prevention and rescue to the local government. The provincial government has submitted a resolution at a meeting not to accept it, and Chairman Xia Douyin telegraphed Commander-in-Chief Jiang to detail the process and request instructions. He also appointed Li Fanyi, Director of the Construction Department, to go to Jiangxi to present the case in person. Li has already taken the Jiangshun vessel east on the evening of the 10th. At this time, when the central and local governments are passing the buck to each other, the Jiang River continues to rise, and the people after the flood are fearful. The Hubei Provincial Party Department, recognizing the severity of the situation, convened a temporary meeting of all members on the 10th, recognizing that the Jianghan Engineering Bureau's dereliction of duty on the eve of the event was a mistake in embankment engineering, placing the people of the entire province in a deadly situation. As a leader of the people, this association cannot remain silent and decided unanimously to urgently telegraph the Central Executive Yuan, Chairman Jiang, and the National Economic Commission to argue forcefully. The Jianghan flood prevention issue has become the focus of contention between the central and local governments. The provincial government believes that the flood prevention measures drafted by the National Economic Commission were issued by the General Headquarters of the Bandit Suppression in the Henan-Hubei-Anhui Provinces, and has responded to the General Headquarters by detailing the flood prevention process over the years and the severe water situation this year, stating that the embankments are vital to Hubei. Flood prevention is even more important during the autumn floods. The former Water Conservancy Bureau drafted regulations for annual repair and protection in May of the 20th year, which were approved and promulgated. The main points are (1) For major embankment engineering projects assigned by the bureau to specialists, the flood prevention matters within five miles above and below the project site shall be the responsibility of the contractor (2) The Jingjiang, Fankou, and Laolong Embankment Engineering Bureaus are permanent agencies, and their flood prevention matters are generally the responsibility of each bureau (3) For main embankments not listed in the above two articles, their flood prevention matters are generally managed by the county magistrates, supervising the embankment directors and embankment guards (4) For flood prevention matters handled by personnel dispatched by the Water Conservancy Bureau, the expenses shall be raised and issued by the bureau; those handled by county magistrates shall be prepared locally, but in the event of major danger that cannot be overcome by local financial resources, the local officials and gentry may telegraph the Water Conservancy Bureau Committee to investigate and subsidize. On April 12 of the 21st year, the former Water Conservancy Bureau re-drafted the Jianghan River Bank Main Embankment Flood Prevention Measures, which were approved by the government for promulgation and implementation. It was slightly changed from before and established twelve monitoring stations throughout the province, organized by one Water Conservancy Bureau Supervision Committee member. They would supervise and lead the embankment repair and flood prevention directors or embankment directors to handle flood prevention matters on each embankment line. The expenses were divided into grades, and pre-allocated subsidies were given to avoid temporary trouble. The total amount allocated for the supervision station's use and flood prevention subsidies was 199,815 yuan. Therefore, the materials and expenses for risk prevention and rescue were fully prepared in advance, with no fear. Since the beginning of the summer this year, there have been continuous torrential rains, and the Jiang River has risen sharply, seemingly even more severe than today's water situation in the 20th year. Now, upon receiving the order to issue the Jianghan Main Embankment Flood Prevention Measures drafted by the National Economic Commission, it is stipulated that the flood prevention matters shall be the responsibility of the local government, and the Jianghan Engineering Bureau's engineering offices shall provide guidance and assistance. The Jianghan Engineering Bureau is the only competent authority for embankment engineering. It is unreasonable and predictable to shirk its responsibility on the eve of the event. At this fleeting moment, the lives of tens of millions of people are entrusted to it. There is no room for contemplation or inaction. It is earnestly requested that the drafted flood prevention measures be changed by clear order to lay the foundation for people's livelihood and to plan for complete safety. (October)</p>
<h3 id="e75">War Clouds Gather in Guizhou Province <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>(Forming a Situation of Warlords Dividing the Territory)</p>
<p>Chongqing Dispatch: Since Wang Jialie re-ascended the stage in Guizhou Province, it has become a fragmented phenomenon. You Guocai, the former Deputy Commander of the 25th Army, has occupied eleven counties including Anshun and Panjiang, while Jiang Bixu, the Commander of the Third Division, has occupied Zunyi, Houping, Dongxi, and other counties. Che Mingyi, the Commander of the Fourth Division, has also occupied three or four counties near Tongren. Currently, Hou Zhixi, the Deputy Commander of the 25th Army and the Chief of the Training Division, has occupied more than ten counties in northern Guizhou, including Chishui. Yang Qichang, the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in eastern Guizhou, has occupied three or four counties including Zhengan and Wuchuan. War clouds are rising, and the various routes are mobilizing troops.</p>
<p>You Guocai's troops recruited exiles from all sides on the Yunnan border and now have a strength of 3,000. Last month, they led their troops back to Guizhou. Wang Jialie, knowing his own weakness, was unable to divide his troops to meet the enemy and repeatedly sent representatives to negotiate peace with You. Initially, eight counties in Panjiang were designated as You's garrison. Subsequently, as You's troops gradually increased, he advanced further and occupied three more counties affiliated to Anshun, totaling eleven counties. The road from Anshun to Guiyang is quite close. Recently, You Guocai planned to make further demands, raising troops to press on Guiyang, forcing Wang to step down and hand over the military and civil affairs of Guizhou Province. Currently, the You and Wang armies are fiercely fighting within Anshun, with no clear victor or loser.</p>
<p>As for Jiang Zailing's troops, they had previously concentrated a strength of more than 3,000 in the Qinan area on the Sichuan-Guizhou border. Last month, they re-entered Guizhou, and their vanguard successively captured Dongxi, Tongzi, Houping, and other counties, heading straight for Zunyi City. They gained and lost again and fought fiercely with Wang Jialie's units, Liao Guozhong, Hou Zhixi, and other brigades on the banks of the Wujiang River. Due to the intense fighting, each side suffered more than a thousand casualties. As a result, Zunyi was still recaptured by Wang Jialie's troops. Jiang Zailing retreated to the Houping area. Due to severe injuries, Guizhou's official report stated that Jiang had died. More than half of the remaining 2,000 soldiers were incorporated into Wang Jialie's army, and the rest fled into banditry on the Sichuan-Guizhou border.</p>
<p>Che Mingyi's troops were originally stationed in Tongren. Wang Jialie believed that Che's unit was only a little over 1,800 people, and he could deal with them, so he sent He Zhizhong's division to pursue them. Che was no match and retreated into Hunan Province. He contacted He Jian's troops, numbering over 2,000, and re-entered Guizhou, engaging in a fierce battle with He Zhizhong in Tongren for five days and nights. He's division was no match and collapsed. Currently, Tongren is still occupied by Che Mingyi's division, who is contacting You Guocai and Yang Qichang's units in eastern Guizhou to jointly attack Guiyang and request Wang Jialie to step down.</p>
<p>Yang Qichang's position as the Commander-in-Chief of eastern Guizhou was originally commissioned by Wang Jialie, but Yang's ambitions were quite large. He wanted to seize all of Guizhou for himself, occupying Zhengan and other three counties, and made every effort to expand his strength, recruiting bandits from all over Sichuan and Guizhou, gathering a crowd of about 5,000 people with only over 3,000 guns. When Jiang Bixu re-occupied Zunyi, Yang seized the opportunity to attack the rear of Wang Jialie's army, engaging in a fierce battle with Li Chengzhang's brigade of Wang's army in Suiyang. After a standoff of about a month, Jiang Bixu failed, and Wang's army concentrated all its efforts to attack Yang Qichang's unit. Yang lacked reinforcements and found it difficult to fight, resulting in a major defeat. His unit now only has about 2,000 soldiers remaining, currently concentrating the remnants in the Zhengan area, engaging in reorganization and planning for a comeback. (8th)</p>
<h3 id="e76">Decline of Hubei Province's Industries <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Provincial Factories Worth Tens of Millions Mostly Shut Down Iron Ore Richly Endowed, Nine Out of Ten Still Awaiting Exploitation Hankou Dispatch: Hubei Province's industries began in the late Qing Dynasty. At that time, Zhang Wenxiang Gong Zhidong was the governor of Hubei and was determined to manage them. Provincial factories such as the Raw Silk Bureau, Jute Bureau, Spinning Bureau, Weaving Bureau, Felt Factory, Paper Mill, Leather Factory, Official Brick Factory, Official Paper Printing Bureau, etc., were established one after another, forming a rudimentary form of industrialization. The value of the houses and machinery was about 10 million yuan or more. After the revolution, the factories were closed one after another, and no one tried to restore them. The machinery in the factories was in disrepair for many years, and the losses were incalculable. According to the investigation, among the bureaus and factories, except for the Weaving Bureau, which still has 41,100 spindles and 655 looms, which are currently leased to the Minsheng Weaving Company for operation, the Official Brick Bureau has two machine brick presses, eleven manual brick presses, eighteen German-style brick presses, and one kiln, leased to the Hengtai Company for operation, the Nanhai Leather Factory is leased to the Ministry of Military Administration for operation, and the Official Paper Printing Bureau is self-operated by the Construction Department, the remaining Spinning Bureau, Raw Silk Bureau, Jute Bureau, Felt Factory, and Paper Mill are all unleased. The houses have collapsed, the machinery is rusty, and the good production facilities have all become waste. As for the richness of Hubei Province's iron ore deposits, it also surpasses other provinces, such as the Xiangbishan in Daye, covering an area of ​​1,456 mu, the Xiaodashan 417 mu, the Fenglieshan 1,535 mu, the Datangshan 709 mu, the Xiejingsi Lijiasan in Yidu, 11,990 mu, and the Xiejingsi North and South Guangpo 22,941 mu, totaling an area of ​​40,000 mu. Except for the Xiangbishan mine in Daye, which has already been mined, the rest have no mining plans. The Xiangbishan mine is also unable to fully develop due to the Han Yeping Company's Japanese capital relationship. It is a pity that the goods are abandoned on the ground. (June 1)</p>
<p>Wuxi Capital Reporters Delegation Visits Wuxi The capital news reporters, considering this town to be a prosperous area for commerce and industry and famous for its scenery, specially organized a Wuxi Model County Inspection Delegation to visit Wuxi. County Chief Yan booked twelve rooms in Wuxi Hotel in advance. The delegation arrived in Wuxi the day before yesterday afternoon, and County Chief Yan Shenyu and Secretary Ye Dezhen specially went to the station to welcome them. There were about twenty members in the delegation. After getting off the train, they all checked into Wuxi Hotel. Then, led by County Chief Yan, they took cars to Meiyuan and Yushan for sightseeing. Yesterday morning at 8:00, they took a motorboat to Taihu Lake, Yuantouzhu, Liyuan, and Xiaojishan for sightseeing. At noon, County Chief Yan hosted a lunch at Guangfusi Temple in Yuantouzhu. They left Wuxi and returned to the capital at about 6:00 in the evening.</p>

Director Dong checked the third meeting of the five provinces and cities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Beijing and Shanghai that have mutual access to automobiles and decided that operating automobiles should not set up operations next to long-distance bus patent lines, and should not solicit business, etc. If what he said is true, it is very inappropriate. Yesterday, he ordered the Xicheng counties to investigate and approve the ban.</p>

<p>Xie Jun, the head of the sixteenth district of Wuyi and the head of the Security Regiment, according to a secret report, Zhu Bingrong, a serial bandit, was hiding in Zhujiacun, Wufeng Township. He had committed many cases with Zhang Hongsheng and other bandits who had been executed. He requested immediate arrest. Director Xie sent Security Regiment soldiers to arrest him. After a preliminary trial, he was sent to the county government for handling on the afternoon of the 10th. It is reported that the bandit had ganged up and robbed Xiao Guijia, Shiqiao, in April of the 20th year, Xue Jinlong's house in Xuejiacun in July, Zhang Jinshan's house in early December, and Wu Jinpei's house in Wufengqiao, and the victim Sui Yaobing was kidnapped in January of the 21st year, and then fled to Shanghai to avoid it temporarily.

<p>Yesterday at about 1:00 PM, a group of officers and soldiers from the Japanese warship "Hurong," which was moored on the river, landed, totaling forty-one people, led by three officers from the ship. They walked barehanded in a line from the riverbank to Boxian Park to climb the mountain and enjoy the scenery. They returned to the ship after about half an hour. It is heard that the fourth and fifth sub-bureaus of the Public Security Bureau ordered the police and plainclothes to follow and monitor the protection to avoid accidents.</p>

It was originally planned to use the remaining land on the left side of the Zhongshan Road Zhongshan Bridge Civilian Hospital as the site for the construction of the general bank building. However, due to certain relationships, construction was not started immediately. It is recently heard that the bank has now agreed to build a new bank building at the original location, which is contracted by the Xinjunji Construction Factory in the city. Construction started yesterday. According to the factory's wishes, it will be completed within two months.</p>

<p>Commander-in-Chief Jiang learned that the water level in the canal was rising daily and was extremely concerned. He specially ordered the Jiangsu Provincial Government to order the Jiangsu Canal Engineering Bureau to report the water levels of each section by telegraph every day for verification, so as to provide guidance. However, the weather has suddenly turned cold in recent days, with alternating sunshine and cloudiness, and the tide has risen suddenly. The water level in the canal has increased daily. According to the report from each district of the Canal Engineering Bureau on the 9th, the Qingjiang water mark has reached one zhang seven chi three cun, the Gaoyou Royal Wharf is seven chi six cun, and the Jiangdu Sangu Gate is one zhang one chi eight cun, which is several inches higher than before. The Canal Engineering Bureau has opened the Xinhe and Dongyu Dams of Jiang Guijiang on the previous two days to discharge the water. If the weather does not clear up again, the water level may still rise greatly, which is quite worrying. It is heard that the Canal Engineering Bureau has ordered each district to select the most important spring repairs to be done first. As for the West Embankment project, half of it has been completed and will be completed around mid-July.</p>

<p>There was a man named Qiang Fengwei in the North Gate Street of this county town, who did not engage in proper business on weekdays. Recently, because of his deep addiction, he repeatedly committed unfilial acts against his biological father, Qiang Shuzhi, repeatedly extorting money, and it was not the first time. His father, Shuzhi, had attempted suicide twice because of the unbearable oppression, but fortunately he was rescued by neighbors. Around two o'clock last night, the rebellious son Fengwei's old tricks reappeared, and he again coerced, beat, and scolded him, causing Shuzhi to become anxious and hang himself with a rope on the rattan chair he was lying on. Although his nephews came to rescue him, it was too late, and he could not be resuscitated. He died of suffocation. The rebellious son saw that things were not good and had already fled.</p>

<p>General Li Du Scheduled to Return Home</p>
<p>Telegram States He Will Depart from Rome on the 14th</p>
<p>Wang Ziyao Scheduled to Depart for Singapore Tomorrow</p>
<p>Wang Ziyao and Liu Piguang, representatives of the anti-Japanese hero General Li Du, received a telegram from General Li from Rome yesterday morning, stating that he would depart for home on the 14th and instructed Wang Ziyao to visit and inspect his troops in Singapore on his behalf.</p>
<p>Telegram from General Li Du</p>
<p>General Li Du sent a telegram from Rome on the 10th to Wang Ziyao and Liu Piguang, the original text of which reads: "Brother has decided to depart by sea for home on the 14th of this month. Please report to the Central Government. My younger brother can accompany Commissioner Huang on a trip to Singapore to inspect the various armies of my department and inform them to obey the orders of Commissioner Huang and stabilize the region. This is the duty of our soldiers."</p>
<p>Supplementary Record of Letter to Younger Brother</p>
<p>The Northeast Border Defense Army's Deputy Commander stationed in Jilin and Commander-in-Chief of the Self-Defense Army, General Li Du, sent a letter from Rome to his younger brother, Li Yulin. Li immediately forwarded it to Liu Piguang, General Li's representative in Shanghai. The original letter described in detail the experience of retreating to Russia and then going to Europe, expressing his grief and indignation. The original letter is excerpted below.</p>
<p>"Younger brother Yulin, as if meeting in person: I have been recuperating in Berlin for more than ten days and have gradually recovered. I arrived in Rome on the 10th. I originally planned to accompany Ma Su and others on a ship back to China. Unexpectedly, internal changes occurred in Xinjiang, and more than 10,000 of our troops were left in Xinjiang without a proper solution. I am very concerned. Ambassador Yan in Moscow is concerned about national affairs. The Northeast has been lost, and the Northwest is also experiencing many troubles. He telegraphed the Central Government, hoping that you and Director Ma (Dehui) would go to Xinjiang to appease the situation. Because I am forced by righteousness, and my officers and soldiers have been fighting hard for a year and are in dire straits, I urgently want to find a way to survive. Moreover, the responsibility of us will not be over until the Northeast is recovered, which is also a major issue. However, I do not want to stay in Xinjiang for a long time. It would be better if the army could be settled and reorganized, and then plan to recover the Northeast. If there is no way to settle them, you can lead them back to Beiping and hand them over to the Central Government for disposal. In short, my spirit has been very tired for the past year, but fortunately my heart has not died. If it is for saving the country, everything can be sacrificed. If there is a heart to save the country, but no way to die for it, I beg the Central Government to provide pensions for all those who died or were injured in the anti-Japanese war, to comfort the loyal souls in the ground and to prevent orphans and widows from becoming beggars. Then, I have nothing to ask for, nothing to hope for. At this point, tears have already followed my pen. I heard that Pingjin is in a state of emergency, and I am very worried. How to settle the family members, you should consider it. I thought I would be able to meet you in 20 days. If I go to Xinjiang, I don't know how many days it will be extended. Brother has always said that China's troubles are internal, not external. Mussolini once said that to save Italy, we must save Italy from within. I originally planned to attend the general meeting on July 1st and make some suggestions, to have the Chinese people wake up and unanimously support the Central Government, and form a solid internal organization before we can speak to the outside world. Unexpectedly, things went against my wishes, which is a pity. Brother and Chairman Ma have always been consistent. I will definitely see you when passing through Tianjin. Yang Qi and the two gentlemen have stayed in Germany for many years. This time, they returned to China for foreign troubles, to contact Singapore and make a statement to Chiang Kai-shek. Where are Ziyao and Piguang? I don't know much. Please forward this letter on my behalf, because I drafted this letter one hour before the ship sailed, and I don't have time for another letter. Please forgive me. In the Battle of Mishan and Hulin, I only escaped with my life. When my sister-in-law arrives in Tianjin, she will be able to tell you about the loss of Xiaofu (General Li's daughter). Don't reveal sad words in front of your parents. Brother Du, written by hand."</p>
<p>Wang Ziyao to Depart for Singapore</p>
<p>Wang Ziyao, General Li's representative stationed in Beiping, came to Shanghai a few days ago, originally planning to wait for Commissioner Huang Musong of the new province to travel to Xinjiang together to convey the intentions of the Central Government and instruct Li's troops stationed in Xinjiang to maintain the spirit of resisting Japan in the past and guard the border for the country. Later, because Commissioner Huang traveled ahead of schedule due to other matters, Wang immediately went to Nanjing to ask the Military Affairs Commission for instructions on everything, and then prepared to depart for Xinjiang. It is now known that Wang received a telegram from General Li, stating that he would take the Eurasia passenger plane from Beijing to Singapore on the 13th, representing General Li to inspect his troops and inform them to obey the orders of Commissioner Huang and stabilize the region.</p>
<p>Liu Piguang's Remarks</p>
<p>According to Liu Piguang, General Li's representative stationed in Shanghai, speaking to a Central News Agency reporter, General Li is currently residing in Rome and is scheduled to return to China by sea on the 14th. Which ship he will be on is still unknown. He should arrive in Shanghai around mid-June. There are more than 10,000 of Li's troops stationed in Xinjiang, with headquarters in Dihua. Wang Ziyao will fly to Xinjiang on the 13th, representing General Li to inspect his troops. As for Madame Li, Xie Yiqing, she has decided to stay in Shanghai temporarily and wait to meet General Li.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Returning Home Recount the Tragic Situation of Anti-Chinese Incidents in Mexico</p>
<p>Local Officials Unable to Stop It, Overseas Chinese All Flee Home Alone</p>
<p>According to the National News Agency, the overseas Chinese in Mexico have been oppressed by the anti-Chinese party one after another, and have successively left Mexico for Shanghai. The Global Overseas Chinese General Association in this port has taken measures to send them back to their native places, totaling about 1,000 people in six batches. There are still many who are on their way home. The matter concerns the national economy and the people's livelihood and is of utmost importance. A reporter from the National News Agency wanted to understand the truth and causes of the anti-Chinese incidents, so yesterday afternoon, he went to the Global Overseas Chinese General Association and interviewed Mr. Zhen Qi and his wife (Zhen's wife, Mei Ling (transliteration), is Spanish), Cantonese overseas Chinese who had recently returned to China (sixth batch), and asked about the process of the Mexican people's rejection of overseas Chinese. Mr. Zhen gave a detailed account.</p>
<p>According to him, "On June 30, 1931, the Mexican anti-Chinese party gathered countless party members in the two provinces of Shanshun to hold a meeting. The results of the meeting were: (1) Eight out of ten employees in overseas Chinese stores must be Mexicans; (2) Work six hours a day, from 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM and from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM; (3) Each person's daily wage is one and a half pesos (equivalent to about three yuan in Chinese currency); (4) Only wholesale is allowed for the operation of various goods, and retail is not allowed; (5) Those who violate the above will be fined 50 to 500 pesos."</p>
<p>"At first, the above methods were proposed, and then overseas Chinese stores were forced to close completely and not allowed to operate. It was also stipulated that all inventory of overseas Chinese merchants should be purchased at 10-20% of the original price. The anti-Chinese party ordered the locals to go to various overseas Chinese stores to force the execution. The overseas Chinese refused because their capital was at stake and only allowed to stop operating immediately, but the Mexicans hired forcibly demanded three months' severance pay, and the overseas Chinese were unable to agree, and almost all of them were arrested or imprisoned. Therefore, all the overseas Chinese groups in the province learned of this and convened an emergency meeting, resolving to telegraph the Chinese Minister to Mexico, urging the Mexican government to seriously negotiate to stop it. Although the government agreed to issue an order to stop it, the violent actions of the anti-Chinese party had no government in sight and never obeyed any orders. The party has the autonomy of the local government, so the orders of the Mexican government have no effect and are allowed to act illegally. At that time, a small number of overseas Chinese stores勉强 opened under pressure, but the locals of the party combined a large team, holding guns, and went to various overseas Chinese stores, regardless of the situation, and fired guns indiscriminately. As a result, four houses were broken into, four people were injured, and one was killed. Therefore, all overseas Chinese merchants had no choice but to stop operating. Then the anti-Chinese party ordered the locals to forcibly buy inventory from various overseas Chinese stores at a price of 10-20%. If they were not satisfied, they would detain people and impose fines of varying amounts. After being released, they were immediately deported. Separate methods for overseas Chinese to leave the country were established: (1) 15 days for those without work; (2) 40 days for those with work; (3) 120 days for farming workers. However, overseas Chinese were troubled by the fact that they could not leave the country within the time limit. The party sent people to break into doors at any time, day and night. If they did not leave after the deadline, they would be arrested. Local officials have been unable to stop it. Recently, the Chinese Consul Pan Ming in Shan Province has negotiated with the Provincial Governor's Office. The provincial authorities directly admitted that they were unable to protect the overseas Chinese and asked them to ask the anti-Chinese party to extend the deadline directly. Consul Pan had no choice but to negotiate with the party, but the result was still not negotiable. It was also claimed that the treaty signed between China and Mexico had expired, and the Chinese in Mexico naturally had no right to reside and should leave the country within the time limit. Therefore, all overseas Chinese merchants could not stay, etc. Mr. Zhen also said that we all fled back alone, and there are about thousands of people who have not returned to China, either on the way or temporarily staying in other countries. Only a few remain in Mexico. Most of these people are reluctant to give up their real estate, so if the government has no appropriate measures, returning to the country is also a matter of time. I deeply hope that our foreign affairs authorities will deal with it," he said.</p>
<p>At this point, the reporter took his leave and left.</p>

<p>After the Approval of the China-British Boxer Indemnity Loan, the Second Confirmation of the Ship Purchase Plan</p>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau Borrowed Boxer Indemnity to Purchase Ships</p>
<p>After the Second Confirmation of the Ship Purchase Plan, Sea Ships Are Modeled After the Taiyuan, and River Ships Are Changed to Shallow-Draft. It Will Be Next Year When They Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau borrowed 360,000 pounds from the China-British Boxer Indemnity Board of Directors, equivalent to more than 5.7 million yuan in national currency, to build new ships and expand river and sea shipping. This matter has been recorded in this newspaper. Now, because the China-British Boxer Indemnity Association has approved the principle of borrowing, the China Merchants Bureau has planned to purchase ships from the UK. After discussion by the shipping and business departments, the size of the ship and the purchase procedures were determined, and a special report was submitted to the board of directors for approval, which will be implemented immediately. The situation is recorded separately as follows after investigation by the reporter of this newspaper.</p>
<p>Estimated Business of Sihai Shipping</p>
<p>The bureau plans to withdraw 5.16 million yuan from the entire Boxer Indemnity to purchase four new sea ships from the UK. The ship type and style were contacted with Taikoo Company, and after reviewing the tonnage, passenger room, load capacity, and business of its Nanyang ship Taiyuan (2994 net tons), it was decided to build four ships modeled after the Taiyuan to operate exclusively on the Shanghai, Shantou, Xiamen, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou routes. The business statistics are also calculated according to the Taiyuan's schedule. Excluding expenses, if calculated based on the current business of the Taiyuan, the four new sea ships can net more than 3 million yuan, which only needs to account for one-ninth to repay the principal and interest of the Boxer Indemnity. However, the bureau does not want to be extravagant and can reduce the estimate during the forecast, even half of the amount is more than enough. Therefore, Sihai Shipping has already decided that the water draft of the two river ships will be changed.</p>
<p>Most of the river ships in the bureau do not have吊鈎, so they cannot承裝 large cargo, which also suffers losses in business. This time, the initial agreement to add river ships with the Boxer Indemnity was to build according to the type of the Wusong wheel in Tai Zhan (3426 tons), which is the largest ship in the bureau's river ships. After several deliberations, how can the Wusong type not be able to sail up the river when the river water recedes slightly, and in fact there is no benefit, so it was decided to change the water draft of the two river ships to be shallower, such as the Wuhu and 武穴 wheels, which also have 2938 tons, and can pass through Yichang and Shashi. After the decision, the shallow-draft type was changed, and the new ship had to come to Shanghai in one year.</p>
<p>This change of plan was reported in detail by the business and shipping departments to the general manager to be transferred to the board of directors for review. It is reported that it has been passed, that is, Manager Liu will contact the procedures for borrowing and extracting the funds and building the wheels in the UK. According to the person in charge of the bureau who told the reporter, it is very beneficial for the bureau to borrow the Boxer Indemnity. It is estimated that the six river and sea ships added will take one year to be fully equipped and開來 Shanghai, so the new ships will be sailing in the early summer of next year.</p>
<p>The principal will be paid off in 14 years, that is, it will be paid off by 1947.</p>
<p>Telegram from the Red Swastika Society Relief Team</p>
<p>Actively Working in Luan County</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai General Office of the World Red Swastika Society received a telegram from the Beijing General Office, stating briefly that the 14th Relief Team of the Society had departed for the Luan County area to implement relief when the military situation was tense. After Luan County fell into the war zone, the team took risks to provide relief amidst gunfire. Yesterday, the Society received a work report from the team, stating briefly that when the war near Luan City was most intense, the county government, the Public Security Bureau, and other agencies had retreated to other places to avoid it temporarily. No one in the city was in charge, and it was extremely chaotic, and people were panicked. The entire team set off and provided relief and maintenance separately. The Luan County Swastika Branch and绅商各界 were afraid that the team would also leave and repeatedly asked them to stay, and they were willing to supply food and grass for relief in Luan. The team replied that the Society's relief team had always avoided difficulties and dangers and did not distinguish between regions, and the only purpose was to provide relief to disasters. At this time, it was the time for our team to implement relief, and there was no reason to withdraw with the army. We hope that people from all walks of life will feel at ease to help our team and find ways to provide relief. All sectors were extremely satisfied, and then together with the branch,筹设 six shelters for women and children. The first shelter was set up in the Swastika Branch, the second shelter was set up in the residence of Wang Shuran, president of West Street, the third shelter was set up in the Women's Swastika Branch, the fourth shelter was set up in the residences of Xie and Zhang, the fifth shelter was set up in the Deshengchang烧锅 in East Street, and the sixth shelter was set up in the Relief Hospital in West Gate. After the establishment of each place, the refugees and women and children who投所 were extremely crowded. In just a few days, 1,837 refugees and women and children were accommodated. Currently, there are still people who continue to投所 every day. In addition, many temporary treatment centers have been set up, and a total of more than 1,600 wounded and sick soldiers and civilians have been treated successively. Currently,诊云 is still being carried out as usual.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the World Red Swastika Society also received a report from the Luan County Branch that large numbers of bandits are everywhere in Luan County, and the killing, wounding, and looting are shocking every moment, which is even more harmful than the disaster of炮火. Those who have fled from the four鄉 are pouring into the city and gathering in the Society's shelter, carrying men and women, in a miserable state. Because of the large number of people, those who are sick rely on the doctors of the relief team currently stationed at the branch for treatment, and they do not have time to spare. Therefore, a hospital has been established in the branch to expand relief.</p>
<p>Telegram from the National Goods Exhibition Hall of the Ministry of Industry</p>
<p>Postponement of the Exhibition</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factory Association received a letter from the National Goods Exhibition Hall of the Ministry of Industry yesterday, stating that the exhibition has been postponed. The text reads: "Our hall was originally scheduled to hold the National Goods Exhibition on June 20. Now that the opening date is approaching, manufacturers are sending exhibits for display on one hand, and筹加 temporary exhibition malls on the other hand, fearing that they will not be able to catch up. After repeated consultations with various national goods groups, for the convenience of manufacturers to prepare calmly, it is proposed that our hall request the Ministry of Industry to extend the period to open on July 10, and the period will still be one month. Nanjing is the central capital, and it is related to the views of both China and foreign countries. The opening of this exhibition in our hall contains the broad significance of advocating, promoting, and selling national goods. We have long tested that your association has led various national goods factories, and you have long shared this heart. We hope that you will widely collect the excellent products of various factories and display them in our hall for the观摩 of people from all walks of life. The temporary exhibition mall opened by our hall also hopes to collect manufacturers to participate enthusiastically, set up shops for sale, and promote publicity. All collections and registrations of exhibits should be handled separately by your association, but the transfer of goods and the filling in of tax exemptions and fee reductions will be issued separately for the extension period."</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Announces Measures for Paying Goods Tax in Shanghai</p>
<p>According to the National News Agency, in order to facilitate merchants in various ports to voluntarily pay taxes in Shanghai for imported goods, the Ministry of Finance specially formulated four measures and ordered Mei Lehe, the General Tax Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs, to instruct all customs to comply with them. The four measures announced are recorded below: (1) Merchants who wish to pay taxes in Shanghai for洋貨运进 from various ports should pre-transfer the amount of gold units to be paid for the goods to the Central Bank of Shanghai for collection on their behalf. The bank will notify the tax-collecting bank of the customs in the port. After verification, the goods will be released; (2) Merchants who运进洋货 from various ports must pay taxes in gold units of more than 10,000 yuan each time; (3) It is temporarily limited to the ports where the Central Bank and the Bank of China collect customs duties on behalf of the customs; (4) Various關稅務司 may add restrictions and stop them at any time.</p>

<p>Please Issue the Price of Land Requisition in the City Center</p>
<p>The Yinxing District Farmers Association Advocates on Behalf of Shanghai City</p>
<p>The Yinxing District Farmers Association of Shanghai City, because the Municipal Government Land Bureau has not issued the price of land requisition in the city center, submitted a report to the Municipal Government, saying, "The farmers in the city center whose land has been requisitioned, who have long been unsettled and wandering around, are in extreme hardship. We respectfully ask you to expedite the issuance of the price to help them find a place to live and relieve the people's difficulties."</p>
<p>"According to the farmers Zhang Gengsheng, Shen Yunsheng, Tang Jisheng, etc. in the clothing, four, five, Zhou Nan, and ten等图 of the district, their farmland and houses and tombs have been included in the land requisition area of the city center since July of the 18th year of the Republic of China, and they have successively submitted the deeds of the land to the Land Bureau, declaring that they will be given a price and忍令 the tombs of their ancestors will be destroyed without余. Because the government has made plans for the central area of the Great Shanghai City, the政令 is雷厉风行. Alas, our farmers will take the few land prices given to find new homes. The land prices are倍昂, and the 隐痛 is already great. It is already a great loss to go and take it. However, the land deeds submitted by the farmers in the previous year and the year before have not been issued to this day. On the one hand, roads are纵横土木大兴, houses are demolished and迁, and地单 is追缴, leaving no effort. Farmers under this special政令 have no time to be surprised, but the land price will not be settled for one day, and the new home will be难卜 for one day. They are荡析飘零,哀号载道, and the suffering is beyond words. Others who think about it in their place will also为之堕泪. Now, it is霉夏多雨 to find land to build a house, and it cannot be緩. For this reason, we respectfully ask you to轉呈 to the Municipal Government, to quickly allocate land prices to relieve the people's difficulties."</p>
<p>"According to this, the farmers claim that the single land they sent in the previous year and the year before has long been unsettled, so that they have no way to find a new home and are飽感荡析飘零苦,幽怨悲愤, which is the truth.钧长与物胞民,痌癏在抱, dare to 转呈鉴核,俯赐行局, immediately issue the land prices of the farmers whose land has been requisitioned to help them find a place to live and relieve the people's difficulties, which is really德便."</p>
<p>Declaration of the Lawyers Association Representative Meeting to Promote the Unified Legal Authority</p>
<p>The Fifth Representative Meeting of the Lawyers Association of the Republic of China issued a declaration for the promotion of unified legal authority, saying, "Our association has long been aware that our country's legal authority has been split by imperialists abroad and trampled by feudal warlords at home, leading to the decline of national dignity and the misery of the people's livelihood. We believe that the way to save this is to devote ourselves to promoting unified legal authority. In the 18th year of the Republic of China, a propaganda group was established for this purpose. Unfortunately, things did not go as planned. The pure and arduous psychology of our association has not been recognized by the general public, and the weakening of legal authority has become increasingly serious. In February of this year, it was decided to abolish the propaganda group and form a Unified Legal Authority Promotion Committee to take charge of this matter. At the Fifth Representative Meeting, it was submitted for discussion, and the众议无异. It is generally recognized that this is the only mission of our association in the future."</p>
<p>"However, looking around the country, the strong enemy is deeply entrenched, and internal strife is growing. It is a time when force is omnipotent, that is, when soldiers are omnipotent. Some commentators may suspect that our association's promotion of unified legal authority is inevitably close to迂阔. I do not know that the organization of the country is different from other groups, only in the existence of law. Modern唯实派法学者 said that law is the country. In other words, the spirit of the country lies in law, and the form of the country is also formed by law. Law and the country are an inseparable whole. Therefore, there is no country in the world without law. Only if there is law but it is not observed is it弃法. To create law by force is违法. The government does not恤弃法违法,陷法于无, causing the loss of legal authority, 上下荡无纲纪, the organization of the country is fundamentally shaken. If this continues, internal strife will inevitably grow longer, and foreign insults will inevitably grow worse. Even if there is force, where can it be used? If you want to save its danger, you must明法. This is one of the reasons why our association promotes unified legal authority."</p>
<p>"Moreover, the party and government authorities are now gathering national strength and advocating the early implementation of constitutional government. Constitutional government is a beautiful name, and the implementation of constitutional government is also a great cause of the country. How can we not sing praises and follow it? Only if you want to implement constitutional government, you must first have law so that you can implement the constitution. Before today, there has been a covenant</p>

<p>The way to realize health, which is the center of the nation, must be based on education. Therefore, the Education Bureau has stipulated that health should be the center of education, and the Health Bureau has also organized school hygiene. Only through the cooperation and sincere unity of the two bureaus can this association be established! To impart hygiene knowledge through education and to promote the realization of hygiene through educational methods, so that people in the society can have a general understanding. The kindness of the intention and the refinement of the equipment are both extremely perfect!</p>
<p>Mr. Wu said: (The materials of this exhibition will be further preserved and reviewed by the Health Education Committee to be compiled into books for textbooks in the future, so that the health movement will have an impact not only on Shanghai, and the spirit of this exhibition can be universal and permanent.)</p>
<p>The reporter personally witnessed and heard, and among the joy and sighs, there are still things that cannot be stopped from being said, written on the left, for the selection of the two bureaus...</p>
<p>What is the purpose of this exhibition? If it is said to be specifically to make society aware that the Education and Health Bureaus are concerned about the issue of health education, then with the wisdom of the officials of the two bureaus, it should not be the case. If it is said to make society understand the importance of health education, then the display of several days does not seem to have achieved much success. Did Mr. Wu not say? [To make the spirit of the exhibition universal and permanent,] I respectfully offer several suggestions for improvement on the next time it is held, based on the two meanings of [universal] and [permanent]... (A) Extending the period To make people have a deep understanding, there must be a long period. This exhibition has been in preparation for months, and nearly a thousand people have worked on it, which can be said to be laborious! However, the opening period is limited to only three days. With the large population of Shanghai and the vastness of the area, no matter what, it is definitely impossible to popularize it in three days. The gain does not make up for the effort, and the loss outweighs the gain. This is one. (B) Expanding the venue Although there are many items in this exhibition, the venue is very small. Viewers enter in single file, without any room to wander around. Every time they want to focus on an item, the person behind has already arrived, so they can only take a quick glance, gaining very little. As a result, many people come with excitement and leave with disappointment. This is the second. (C) Lectures and guidance This exhibition is only so-called one exhibition and one look! Smart people should have an understanding, but dull people seem to have difficulty forming an impression. If more guiding personnel can be set up to give lectures or explanations, so that all visitors can gain a thorough understanding, wouldn't it be better than crowding together and just taking a look? This is the third.</p>
<p>What I have seen is only this much! It is not that I have any criticism of this association. These are just humble opinions, and wise men will choose them! What do you think of their quality? Health Methods for Farmers - Ding Fubao Deep breathing method. As mentioned above. Now, let me talk about the sunbathing method. The sun shines in the middle of the sky, and everyone can see it. However, the function of sunlight on our bodies may not be known to everyone. Therefore, it is necessary to briefly describe the function of sunlight. When we are exposed to sunlight, it can warm the whole body, improve blood circulation, and make the skin healthy, which is due to the effect of infrared rays in sunlight. These infrared rays are called heat rays. The use of sunlight to treat all chronic tuberculosis and surgical diseases is due to the effect of ultraviolet rays. These ultraviolet rays are called chemical rays. Sunlight has these two kinds of light rays that are beneficial to the human body. Therefore, hygienists in all countries are promoting sunbathing. It can treat diseases if you have them, and improve health if you don't. Hygienists also attach great importance to sunbathing, dividing it into local baths and full-body baths, and setting various methods of implementation. However, farmers who often work in the sun do not need this. They only need to wear a hat to avoid brain diseases. Farmers do not know about deep breathing, and it still needs our promotion. As for sunbathing, farmers are often exposed to sunlight, so there is no need for us to keep talking about it. However, I cannot help but say one thing: I want to make farmers know the value of sunlight and not feel bitter about working under the sun. In luxurious houses with heavy doors, there are people who seek it but cannot find it. In addition to practicing deep breathing and sunbathing, there are several other things that should be practiced. For example, get up early every day and wipe your whole body with cold water to remove sweat and dirt from your skin. Also use cold water to wash your face and hair. Usually wear less clothing and learn to tolerate the cold. These are all ways to increase skin resistance. Water in rivers contains various infectious bacteria and should never be drunk. All drinking water must be boiled. Bowls, chopsticks, tea cups, and other items must be washed with boiling water before use. Wash your hands frequently with soap, lest your fingers carry germs that get into your mouth. Do not eat ice cream, ice water, sour plum soup, sugarcane juice, etc. sold in markets and towns. Also, do not eat sliced ​​water chestnuts, peeled sugarcane, cut-open melons and fruits, fruits soaked in raw water, and food that flies have landed on. In summer and autumn, if you suffer from diarrhea, vomiting, and other symptoms, and suspect that you have cholera, you can first take a small amount of alum powder and drink it with boiling water. This is because cholera bacteria die when they encounter alum water. It is more effective than any other medicine for heatstroke. Moreover, alum has astringent properties, which can prevent the water in the blood from being completely discharged. Even if it is not cholera, taking alum is beneficial and harmless. Cigarettes, opium, and various kinds of alcohol can seep into the brain, heart, lungs, stomach, and blood, paralyzing their functions and deteriorating their constitution. Therefore, they should be abstained from. Tea leaves are also harmful and not beneficial, so they can also be avoided. I have not drunk tea for more than forty years. Also, use less salt. Over time, you will reap great benefits. Getting up early and going to bed early is very beneficial. In the time of Emperor Yao, Gu Yan said, "Work when the sun rises and rest when the sun sets." This was the good custom of farmers at that time. If you do this, not only will you be healthy, but you will also save a lot of money on lamp oil throughout the year. Today, there are also farmers who gather to drink and gamble, and do not sleep late at night. If farmers want to take tonics, they can buy one dou of yellow beans. Soak a small amount of beans in water for about a day. Grind them into fine powder and squeeze out the juice with coarse cloth. Cook it and add sugar. This is soybean milk. Its function is equivalent to cow's milk, but its price is more than ten times cheaper than cow's milk. If many people drink it, add more beans. Even if the whole family drinks it, the cost is not high. Eggs are also the most delicious food. Limit yourself to two eggs a day. There is also a special food that is both economical and rich in vitamins, and everyone can try it. Soak grains with vitality in clean water. After they sprout, cook them and eat them. The longer the sprouts grow, the less the cost. Eating one grain sprout is equivalent to ten or more grains of white rice. This is also a way to save money and stay healthy. In addition, wheat can be used to make wheat sprouts, soybeans can be used to make soybean sprouts, and broad beans can be used to make broad bean sprouts, and so on. However, the sprouts should not be too long. If they are too long, both the sprouts and roots will be old and difficult to swallow. The above-mentioned hygiene methods can be used not only by farmers, but also by middle-class families. Not only middle-class families, but also wealthy merchants and great men can try them. Often, wealthy people with many diseases can be cured by using these methods, and they may not need to take tonics all year round. I have been personally practicing these methods for a long time. Over the past ten years, I have become increasingly robust. If anyone doubts my words, why not try it for two or three months to see the effect? Common Sense Questions and Answers about Diseases - Cheng Hanzhang (9) Cholera (Vomiting and Diarrhea Epidemic) (Commonly known as "deflated conch rash," "leg-raising rash," also known as "tiger epidemic") Question: What epidemic are people being vaccinated against recently? Answer: It is to prevent cholera vomiting and diarrhea epidemic, which is most likely to be prevalent in summer. Question: What is the pathogen of cholera vomiting and diarrhea epidemic? Answer: It is a short rod-shaped bacterium. When observed under a microscope, one end is slightly thicker, and the whole body is slightly curved, like a comma punctuation mark. Question: Where did this disease originate? Answer: It is said to have been introduced from India. Therefore, it is also called Indian cholera. (Cholera indica) Question: What is the Western name for cholera? Answer: The Western name is Cholera or Cholera Asiatica. Question: Why is it also called tiger epidemic? Answer: Because the Japanese transliteration is "Korera"; therefore, ordinary people abbreviated it as "tiger epidemic" and described its momentum as fierce. In fact, it is wrong, because the Japanese pronunciation of "Korera" is Cholera. Question: Where does this pathogenic bacteria exist, and how can it be transmitted to the human body? Answer: Cholera bacteria exist in the feces and vomit of patients, and often invade the intestines of the human body by contaminating our food from the feet and wings of flies. Question: Is summer the most prevalent season for cholera? Answer: Yes. This proves that flies spread germs in summer. Question: How many days after infection with the pathogenic bacteria does the disease occur? Answer: Symptoms appear after an incubation period of one to three days. Question: What are the initial symptoms when the disease occurs? Answer: Initially, there is prodromal diarrhea, without pain; then cholera attacks begin, starting with vomiting and diarrhea (persistent vomiting, diarrhea one or twenty times a day). The stool loses its original appearance and is very much like rice water. Because of such vomiting and diarrhea, the body lacks water, causing thirst, sunken eye sockets, half-open eyelids, dilated pupils, dry and cloudy cornea, dark eyelids, prominent cheekbones and bridge of the nose, dry and cool skin, pale color, loss of elasticity, many wrinkles, and sunken fingerprints, so it has the common name of "deflated conch rash" (conch refers to spiral patterns). Question: What are the subsequent symptoms? Answer: Body temperature is lower than normal on the body surface, but when measured internally in the anus, it is seen to rise. The pulse is frequent and weak, the skin is cyanotic, secretions are reduced, and the voice is hoarse. Muscle spasms occur, especially in the lower legs; therefore, it has the common name of "leg-raising rash." Intestinal peristalsis is active in the abdomen, with succussion sounds and borborygmi. Consciousness is cloudy. Question: What is the final outcome? Answer: After one or two days in the above situation, it transitions to the false death period, the pulse stops, the skin turns cyanotic, and all secretions cease. The whole body becomes a lead-grayish white color and falls into a coma. Question: Does cholera have cases that develop dangerously quickly? Answer: Yes; from the onset of vomiting and diarrhea to death, it only takes a few hours... This is called fulminant or dry cholera. Question: According to general statistics, what is the mortality rate of this disease? Answer: About 40% to 50%. In recent years, due to the progress of injection and emergency treatment methods in our country, the mortality rate is said to be only 7% or 8%. However, it is probably because many patients sent to the hospital for treatment are mixed with false cholera or acute enteritis, so this statistic is not very reliable. Question: What is the treatment method for cholera? Answer: Patients should eat liquid foods and drink plenty of beverages such as black tea and coffee to replenish the water lost in the body. It is also necessary to quickly inject physiological saline or Ringer's solution, which can be administered intravenously or subcutaneously. This not only replenishes water but also dilutes toxins. In addition, use tannic acid water to wash the intestines, take activated charcoal internally, and potassium permanganate... Sometimes take castor oil or licorice and other laxatives. For severe vomiting, swallow ice cubes with chloroform water, or use atropine sulfate injection. An Investigation into the Current Situation of the Wuzhou Gubenzhao Pharmaceutical Factory (1) - Zhi Wuzhou Gubenzhao Pharmaceutical Factory is a well-known chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturer in China. The factory is located west of Jinyiqiao in Xujiahui, Shanghai, covering an area of ​​more than 40 mu. The buildings are spacious and the scale is grand. There are more than 600 employees. The factory produces more than 1,000 kinds of products, making it one of the leading enterprises in China's pharmaceutical and chemical industry. During the reign of Emperor Xuantong of the Qing Dynasty, a man named Panmen founded the Gubenzhao Factory here. Ou Fa. Panmen was called back to his country. The owner of the Wuzhou Pharmacy bought it with a large sum of money. Later, in the tenth year of the Republic of China, it purchased the Yalin Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory. In the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, it purchased the Zhonghua Zhenji Soap Factory and the Nanyang Cork Factory. Then, the original pharmaceutical department of Wuzhou was merged into one place and renamed Wuzhou Gubenzhao Pharmaceutical Factory. Over the years, the factory buildings have been built and expanded with great care. It can be seen that starting a business is not easy, and the hard work and efforts of those involved have contributed to its success. The factory's organizational system follows scientific management methods. Regarding administrative matters, there is a factory affairs meeting. Regarding technical matters, there is a technical meeting. These are the highest authorities in the entire factory. In terms of work, it is divided into five departments: pharmaceutical, soap-making, research, general affairs, and design. Division of labor and cooperation is orderly. Therefore, it has the efficiency of a large factory production without the looseness and abuses of a large factory. The effectiveness of its management can be seen from this alone. The total engine power of the factory is 54 horsepower. There are four horizontal boilers. In addition to supplying part of the power, all the steam and heat required by the factory are taken from here. There are also dozens of large and small electric motors, with a total horsepower of more than 50 horsepower. Most of them are directly connected to the machinery they drive, which is a rationalized arrangement for easy management and power saving. The equipment and work of each department are briefly described on the left. 1. Soap Department The manufacturing of household soap in this factory is different from ordinary methods. Its principle is based on the Krebs method, using lime to compound with fatty acid, and then using sodium carbonate to exchange and generate sodium soap, which is the indirect soap-making method. The manufacturing sequence is as follows. (1) Treatment of Oils First, various oils such as tallow, oil of pine, mutton tallow, bean oil, etc. are mixed appropriately. Place them in the oil tank and heat them with steam to dissolve them. Remove the residue and pump it into a large bucket with a pump. Remove dirt and moisture with sulfuric acid. Part of the lime soap tank and washing machine in the soap department (2) The Production of Lime Soap Lime is put into a square alkaline pool, and a certain amount of water and the purified oil are added. Mix and stir them, maintaining a temperature of 100-110 degrees Celsius. After about an hour, cover it with a wooden board and seal it with linen. Let it stand overnight to obtain lime soap.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn National Appeal - Yang Shi</p>
<p>Seeing someone else's knife slashing down with great force, but the quilt is always too warm, and one's own arms are always meant to embrace a loved one and hold a rice bowl. Unwilling to just parry it, but the knife is too fast, falling like lightning, having no choice but to shout out loud, "Where is our General Kemal? Where is our Mussolini?"... This is the appeal for a Kemal or a Mussolini to sacrifice their quilt, to sacrifice their arms to save me! Borrow their strength to parry, or hope that they can drive away the enemy, allowing me to sleep comfortably in this quilt, keeping my hands free to embrace my loved one and hold my rice bowl...</p>
<p>Chinese people are really smart, they are truly civilized people from an ancient country. They are probably gentlemen who are good at borrowing things, letting others do everything for them. They are truly people from an ancient country of science who can invent gunpowder and compasses. According to contemporary scientists, "In the future, all work of people can be done by machines." In this way, since Chinese people have promoted science early, their lives can naturally be substituted by others. Therefore, Chinese people sleep in their quilts, unwilling to stretch out their arms, and shout for Kemal and Mussolini, which is precisely because they are good at borrowing things and using machines to do it for themselves! With a shout, they will create robots like Kemal and Mussolini to replace themselves. Haha! The Chinese nation is an excellent and hopeful nation because, first, it has become a gentleman, and second, science is extremely prosperous.</p>
<p>But Chinese people, don't be too clever! If you instill this great idea of ​​being good at borrowing things into robots, robots will also love the quilt and will not be willing to take out their useful arms to serve others. At that time, you still cannot escape the enemy's knife! Entering the mold - Qing Qufei In the fifth month, on the 17th day of the lunar calendar (the 9th of this month), it was "entering the mold." When I saw this word "mold," I felt a headache, because once this kind of weather arrives, everyone will feel very uncomfortable and depressed. What is the reason? Sometimes it rains for a while, as if it won't clear up. The eaves drip with a babbling sound. If you go out, it is truly what is said, "Rain falls and the sky keeps guests," making people unable to leave even if they don't want to stay. This is what you often encounter. Even those who are punctual and try to please people are always oppressed by the power of nature. Moreover, when the sunlight is sometimes bright and sometimes dim, you really can't tell whether it's raining or sunny that day. It's just called "yellow plum season, rain in every home." During this period when plums are yellow and ripe, there is often more rain than sunshine. Not only that, but it's suddenly hot and suddenly cold. When it comes to clothing, if you wear one more piece, you will feel hot; if you wear one less piece, you will feel cold. Even hygienists don't have a proper method of prevention.</p>
<p>I learned from ancient books that the reason why this season makes people feel heavy and dull is that everyone can't help but say angrily, "This yellow plum weather is really annoying!" Therefore, the ancients said it well, this word "plum" should be interpreted as "mold." "Mold" is the heat in the rain. If it rains and gets on your clothes, then many small black spots will appear, which cannot be washed clean. Now, microbiologists also use this word "mold" to describe it. The stains of "mold" are a kind of lower plant, called "mold fungi." This is all the same principle, so it appears in red, yellow, green, and black colors. If you look at it clearly with a microscope, it is really beautiful! Therefore, by talking about many other prominent things, calling it "plum" easily gets on things. Calling it "mold" relies on its original nature to make wine, soy sauce, and fermented things. Calling it "mold" has reasonable explanations and is not without distinction. However, people in Fujian say that entering the plum season happens after the summer solstice when it meets Geng, and leaving the plum season happens after the grain in ear when it meets Ren. The geography may also be different. We "in Jiangnan, welcome the plum rain in the third month and send off the plum rain in the fifth month," which is not the same as the current weather. This may be the change between the past and the present, which is unknown. An old farmer has a common saying based on experience, called "A thunderclap at the minor heat, the yellow plum returns as before," which is just like the idiom that when ordinary people encounter unfortunate things, it is called "bad luck," which is indeed a good example of symbolizing the same downturn between people and the weather. A scoundrel holding a Buddha - An egg is the best food. Protein is of course a nutrient, and the sulfur in the egg yolk is also beneficial to eat. Therefore, medical scientists say, "A person can maintain life by eating seven eggs a day." Eggs are of high value in terms of nutrients, and no one dares to deny this. But when eggs become spoiled, the protein changes in quality, and eating them is already harmful. The sulfur in the egg yolk combines with the light gas in the air, called "hydrogen sulfide," which emits an ammonia-like odor that makes people cover their noses and pass by. Therefore, we really dare not ask for "bad eggs" in the market. "Get lost" and "son of a bitch" are both common swear words; two-tenths profit, one-tenth profit, two-tenths profit... It's not a big deal. Banks and silver companies are so generous, far better than opening gambling dens and lending money at exorbitant interest rates. Our country's bankers are not like the "scoundrels" in America. They are known for their excellent credit and prosperous business. The newly opened banks will be full! Analogy of Small Animals - Drunkard Summer has arrived, and those terrible flying and running animals will be born in season and gradually enter the market; these flying and running animals are nothing else but small animals belonging to the insect class, such as mosquitoes, flies, bedbugs, fleas, and lice. Wherever there are houses and beds, these fellows roam and rampage. All living beings are harassed and antagonized by them. The above-mentioned small animals are quite similar to several kinds of human beings when compared. Now, I will describe them separately below! Mosquitoes are like modern women; they have a slender and graceful figure and a delicate and melodious voice. They can sing and dance. When they dance, their posture is graceful; when they sing, their tone is buzzing, which simply makes people unable to sleep. They like to contact anyone, draw human blood, and spread malaria germs. This has the same magical power as romantic women infecting syphilis. Flies are like communists; especially red-headed flies, which are thoroughly red. They like to invade people's food, clearly embracing communism. They are good at singing humming tunes and are rich in propaganda power. They spread germs and cause harm everywhere. Although they are hunted and killed in every possible way, they are difficult to eliminate, just like the communist bandits. Bedbugs are like corrupt officials; they suck the fat of the people. Often, they make people restless and unable to sleep. They only know how to collect and don't care about leaving a bad name. Their filthy morals are well-known, which makes people cover their noses. Moreover, they have a large belly and a stumbling posture, which is very much like the attitude of an old bureaucrat who is a rich man. Fleas and lice are like thieves; their ability to jump high is really amazing. Therefore, their whereabouts are erratic and difficult to catch. This is no different from the acrobatic thieves and bandits. A Long Novel: The Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast - Zhang Henshui Chapter 8: Indignant words incite youth to resign and flee; warm heart pities young girl, bringing matchmaker with her. Huang Manying smiled and said, "It's not really fate, it's just that your eldest daughter is enthusiastic." Guizhi smiled and said, "Why don't you say it yourself? Who is enthusiastic? Such a long way, not afraid of the wind, not afraid of the cold, twenty or thirty miles, bringing several things." Huang Manying blushed involuntarily upon hearing this, and lowered her head to eat two dumplings. Finally, she came up with a sentence and looked at Guizhi with a slight smile, "You're afraid I don't know about your affairs." This simple statement made the blush on Guizhi's face reach the roots of her ears. Seeing Miss Huang bringing clothes and socks from so far away, Lady Jiang was already greatly moved. Now that Miss Huang said she knew about Guizhi's affairs, it goes without saying that Miss Huang also knew that Company Commander Guan was going to act as a matchmaker. This was a good opportunity to use Miss Huang's ready-made facts to allude to her own daughter. So she smiled and said, "Miss Huang and Company Commander Tian are really a good match. I heard that Company Commander Tian always goes out with Miss Huang when he goes to the city." Huang Manying picked up some vegetables and chewed them in her mouth, smiled slightly, and said in a low voice, "That's not necessarily true." Seeing that she did not find this sentence difficult to accept, Lady Jiang further asked, "Do we have the good fortune to drink a glass of your wedding wine?" Huang Manying smiled and said, "It's early, it's early, it's not worth mentioning." Lady Jiang straightened her face and said, "Now there are many families who are unwilling to marry their daughters to soldiers. Actually, as long as the person is good, it doesn't matter what they do. For example, Miss Huang, aren't you and Company Commander Tian very good?" Huang Manying smiled and said, "Speaking of this, it was I who encouraged him to join the army. He was originally from Shenyang and was a college student in Beiping, living a very comfortable life. After the September 18th Incident, his family was raided by the Japanese. Not only could he not study, but he couldn't go home either. He was so anxious that he wanted to commit suicide. I said, 'If you are determined to commit suicide, why not join the army? Anyway, you are risking your life, and you can make some sense out of risking your life like this. What are you afraid of when you are a soldier? In this day and age, you can only let off steam by being a soldier. The military camp does not accept female soldiers. If the military camp accepts female soldiers, I will also join the army.'" Lady Jiang smiled at Guizhi and said, "Listen to her." Not only did Guizhi feel that these three words had a profound meaning, but Huang Manying also sighed and smiled. (97) Women's Paradise: What Every Housewife Should Know - Chu Method for Preventing Food Poisoning It is now the Yellow Plum season. From this rainy season to summer, the temperature gradually increases, and all kinds of food are most susceptible to spoilage. Because during this period, bacteria thrive, and the bacteria attached to the food multiply very quickly. If we are not careful, we will eat poisonous items. The toxins from spoilage caused by water-soluble carbohydrates and fats are the most common during this period. If we accidentally eat these toxins, we will have abdominal pain at the very least, and vomiting and diarrhea at worst. Especially in protein-based foods, the toxicity is greatest. The so-called "Ptomaine" toxins often pose a life-threatening danger. Ptomaine toxins are mostly generated in eggs, meat, and seafood. Therefore, we should pay twelve points of attention to prevention. The method of prevention: First, during this period, never buy too much food, but only buy enough for one day's consumption. Second, if there is no refrigerator, you can make a wooden storage box to reduce the growth of bacteria. Third, eat some fruits after each meal, because fruits contain fructose and glucose. If the toxin is caused by protein, it can be neutralized with sweet fruits. Fourth, if you are poisoned by oily foods, you can eat more vinegary foods to reduce the toxicity. Fifth, if you feel uncomfortable after eating, you can first drink some clear water, then insert your index finger into your throat to make the food come out. Sixth, if several hours have passed and you feel uncomfortable in your stomach, you can drink some castor oil to make it excrete. (The dosage of castor oil is 20-30 watts for adults, half for children under twelve, and half again for those five or six years old.) The above-mentioned detoxification methods are very simple. Housewives must remember them well. Nutritional Common Sense about Vitamins Housewives who control cooking should understand nutritional knowledge. Now what I am talking about refers to common foods in the family. (1) Vitamin A: If our bodies lack Vitamin A, then the body will be very weak, because there is not much Vitamin A, the resistance is weak, and various germs can easily invade. Among them, roundworms and hookworms are most likely to occur, and other symptoms such as dry eyelids and blurred vision also follow. Therefore, we should absorb more Vitamin A in our food, such as butter, egg yolk, fish, turnip leaves, spinach, and cod liver oil, which are rich in Vitamin A. (2) Vitamin B: If our bodies lack Vitamin B, then beriberi will occur. The method of prevention is to not eat only refined rice, but to eat more green vegetables, beans, brown rice, wheat flour, etc., which can increase it. (3) Vitamin C: This is most abundant in fruits and green vegetables. Radishes have relatively more. (4) Vitamin D: Because children lack Vitamin D, their bones and teeth cannot develop healthily, and they are also prone to catching colds. However, it is very lacking in daily foods. The most abundant is cod liver oil. Others such as fish and mushrooms also have it. In addition to food, we can supplement it from sunbathing. (5) Vitamin E: If women lack Vitamin E, they will not be able to get pregnant, and even if they are pregnant, the fetus cannot develop, and there are often harms such as stillbirths and miscarriages. This Vitamin E is mostly found in wheat, turnips, germ rice, and green vegetables. Especially eating germ rice is most beneficial. Now I will talk about choosing economical nutritional foods. For middle-class families and below, daily side dishes are always based on being cheap and good-looking. It is said that spending a few copper coins can also get nutritious food. However, women without common sense often spend more money but cannot eat beneficial items. For example, for white rice, people who eat first-class refined rice get less water-soluble carbohydrates than people who eat third or fourth-class coarse rice. People who eat butter get less fat than people who eat peanut oil. Other economical foods containing nutrients can be inferred by analogy. Now I will list the types of nutrients in food: 1. Protein foods: such as beef, blue fish, silver carp, soybeans, etc. 2. Water-soluble carbohydrate foods: potatoes, yams, lilies, arrowroot powder, etc. 3. Fat foods: butter, lard, sesame oil, peanut oil, soybean oil, rapeseed oil, etc. 4. Inorganic salt foods: milk, shrimp, etc. 5. Vitamin A foods: milk, liver, spinach, turnip leaves, cod liver oil, egg yolk, etc. 6. Vitamin B: honey, brown rice, soybeans, wheat, beans, millet, spinach, etc. 7. Vitamin C: oranges, lemonade, radishes, onions, etc. 8. Vitamin D: cod liver oil, shiitake mushrooms, fish, etc. 9. Vitamin E: pork, wheat, turnip leaves, and various green vegetables, etc. Looking at it this way, the nutrients obtained by people who eat vegetables and coarse rice are actually more than those who eat delicacies.</p>

<p>Educational News and Important Cultural Events A New Era of Cultural History: Reprinting the Siku Quanshu Seven Rare Editions that Have Suffered from War, Only Three Remain More than 300 Types First Selected, Based on Wenxiao The Commercial Press Will Undertake the Funding, to be Completely Printed in Two Years The Handmade Paper Used Will be Custom-Made by the Jiangnan Paper Mill After Completion, It Will Be Exchanged with Various Countries to Promote Culture The draft for reprinting the Siku Quanshu has been approved by the previous Executive Yuan meeting. Our reporter believes that this matter is of great importance to Chinese culture, so yesterday he specially visited Jiang Fucong, director of the preparatory office of the Central Library, to inquire about the details. Mr. Jiang gave a very detailed reply, stating that only three of the seven rare editions remain. According to Mr. Jiang, there are seven rare editions of the Siku Quanshu: Wenjin, Wenxiao, Wensu, Wenyuan, Wenhui, Wenzong, and Wenlan. The first four editions are stored in the imperial palaces and are called the "inner court editions." Their pages are very large, the calligraphy is exquisite, and the paper is also of high quality. The latter three editions are civilian editions, treasured by common people, with smaller pages and less exquisite calligraphy and paper than the inner court editions. Among the seven editions, Wenjin is the most elaborate, and Wenxiao is the earliest. These seven rare editions have suffered from war and gone through many vicissitudes. The Wenjin edition is now collected by the Peking Library, and the Wenxiao edition is kept by the Palace Museum. The Wensu edition was formerly in Peking, but was later taken by Zhang Zuolin and stored in Liaoning. After the September 18th Incident, it is believed to have been seized by the Japanese. The Wenyuan edition was originally stored in the Yuanmingyuan, but was destroyed in the Anglo-French War. The Wenhui and Wenzong editions were destroyed early in the Taiping Rebellion, and the Wenlan edition was also destroyed by two-thirds due to years of loss. However, it has now been completely re-copied, but the calligraphy and paper are far inferior to the past. This edition is currently stored in the Zhejiang Library. Therefore, only the Wenjin, Wenxiao, and Wenlan editions are currently preserved in our country. The Wenxiao edition has been transported to Shanghai for preservation. The content of the Siku Quanshu includes the essence of Chinese cultural relics from past dynasties. Its catalogue contains more than 3,400 types. If all of them are printed, not only will the financial resources be insufficient, but it is also not necessary in fact. Because since the Song and Yuan dynasties, there have been more than 2,600 types of common reprints in the market, so there is no need to reprint them, which would be a waste of financial resources. It is now planned to print more than 300 types first, and then print more than 400 types when funds are available in the future. These more than 300 types to be printed first have been selected by me and various experts. The selection criteria are: (1) ancient books that are absolutely not preserved elsewhere; (2) only manuscripts and never engraved; (3) although there were engraved editions between the Song and Yuan dynasties, they have been lost today. The base edition for this reprint will be the Wenxiao edition, because the Wenxiao edition was copied the earliest and has fewer typos. Moreover, all the cultural relics of the Palace Museum have been moved south, and the Wenxiao edition has also been transported to Shanghai with various items, which can reduce a transportation cost. Contents of the Commercial Press Reprinting Contract Mr. Jiang continued, "This reprint is entirely undertaken by the Commercial Press. Several consultations have been held, and all principles have been decided. The draft contract has also been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, but the approval order has not yet been issued. Once the order arrives, a formal contract can be signed and printing can begin. The content of the draft contract is as follows: (1) First select and print more than 300 types, with a total of 90,000 pages of paper, bound into 1,500 volumes as one set. First print 1,500 sets. (2) Completely printed within two years. (3) All printing, labor, and material costs are borne by the Commercial Press. (4) After printing, send several copies to this office, and the rest will be sold by the Commercial Press. This office will collect royalties. (5) The copyright belongs to the National Central Library. Any subsequent printing must first obtain the consent of this office, and this office will continue to collect royalties." Custom-Made Paper from the Jiangnan Factory As for the paper used for the 1,500 sets, it will require more than 100,000 reams. If Chinese paper is used, the paper production areas have been under the control of the Red Army in recent years, and transportation is cut off, making procurement difficult. The production in other areas is very small. Since the September 18th Incident, the Commercial Press has only been able to collect and purchase 10,000 reams across the country, which is not enough even after ten years of accumulation, and the price is very high, which is not cost-effective. However, if foreign goods are used, it seems to violate the meaning of preserving national essence. After repeated consideration by all parties, it has been decided to order Chinese-style handmade paper from the Jiangnan Paper Mill,</p>

<p>Economic Supplement, Issue 26, Published Every Monday. Wishing Success to the World Economic Conference</p>
<p>The World Economic Conference is scheduled to open today in London. Representatives from various countries have arrived, gathering talents to discuss international strategies. While its future effectiveness remains uncertain, it is undoubtedly one of the world's grand gatherings. Tracing the origins of this conference, in June of last year, Britain, France, and other nations held a meeting in Lausanne, resulting in five resolutions. The fifth resolution explicitly proposed initiating a World Economic Conference. Subsequently, the League of Nations appointed experts from various countries to form a preparatory committee. This committee convened twice, establishing the following agenda items: (1) International Debt Issues, (2) Currency System Issues, (3) Tariff Issues, (4) Price Issues, (5) Elimination of Barriers to International Trade, (6) Free Flow of Capital.</p>
<p>Since October 1929, the sudden drop in market prices on the New York Stock Exchange triggered a global panic, causing a sharp decline in various commodity prices and increasing business stagnation. Unemployment rose year by year, and financial difficulties worsened. Each country, aiming to maintain its own interests, raised tariffs to curb the import of foreign goods and devalued its currency to aggressively dump its products. Creditor nations were unwilling to ease the burden on debtor nations, focusing solely on accumulating cash. The distribution of cash became unbalanced, hindering the flow of capital, impeding trade development, and weakening purchasing power. Attempts to exchange goods were obstructed by tariff barriers, intensifying international competition and making the global recession seem irreversible. In today's circumstances, no country can isolate itself from the world. Since isolation is impossible, mutual survival is essential, and international cooperation is the only path to mutual survival. The convening of the economic conference responds to the needs of the times, and as this auspicious opening day arrives, people around the world place high hopes on it. Looking ahead, we cannot help but hope for its success.</p>
<p>Some argue that the global recession is caused by the capitalist system, and the root of the recession will not be eliminated until capitalism falls. Moreover, under the current circumstances, seeking international cooperation is futile. Britain and the United States are the main players in this conference. Britain, while advocating cooperation, has also signed the Ottawa Agreement with its colonies, forming an economic alliance within its empire, clearly discriminating against other countries. This is solid proof of Britain's lack of sincerity. The United States abandoned the gold standard just before the economic conference's opening, engaging in currency wars while hoping for the stability of other countries' currency systems. Is this not extremely contradictory? With national representatives wearing masks to maneuver, seeking any achievement from this conference is merely a pipe dream. In essence, mutual suspicion and intense competition among countries are driven by the capitalist system. Without eliminating this system, there is no room for international cooperation. Is the convening of the economic conference addressing the symptoms rather than the root cause? The current world trend can be divided into two major directions. The Soviet Union is implementing socialism, balancing production and consumption, achieving remarkable results, and eliminating unemployment. Other countries maintain the capitalist system without any changes, allowing capitalists to exploit at will, further reducing the purchasing power of the people, leading to stockpiles of goods and economic stagnation. Comparing these two approaches reveals the advantages and disadvantages, yet some commentators remain oblivious to this? The response is that the so-called opposition between socialism and capitalism does not truly grasp the essence of the matter. The Soviet Union's system is not purely socialist, and other countries' economic systems have long lost their original form. They are neither fish nor fowl, resembling each other. Therefore, one cannot judge the merits of the two systems based solely on this. Furthermore, advanced countries with earlier industrial and commercial development are inherently exclusive. The Soviet Union, claiming to be communist, strives to surpass advanced countries in production, inevitably leading to the dumping of its products abroad as its production increases significantly. In today's world, national boundaries have not disappeared, and ethnic boundaries have not been broken. Regardless of the economic system a country implements, it prioritizes its own interests. Unless efforts are made to promote mutual understanding, there can be no hope for co-existence and common prosperity. Now that the Four-Power Pact has been signed, disarmament negotiations may reduce obstacles. We still hold a glimmer of hope for the economic conference.</p>
<p>Economic Panic and Economic Conference</p>
<p>I.A.</p>
<p>Since the autumn of 1929, when the financial crisis erupted on Wall Street in the United States, every country except for special cases like Soviet Russia and Japan, which mitigates domestic disputes by taking advantage of its neighbor and forcibly occupying the four northeastern provinces of China, has experienced a daily increase in the unemployed masses, a daily decline in the cost of living index, and a daily reduction in the rate of industrial production, even to the point where import and export trade has drastically decreased. Capitalist economists previously believed this was just a periodic panic, but the overwhelming evidence has proven that the deepening of this panic has other fundamental causes.</p>
<p>Let's first examine some facts about the global economic panic.</p>
<p>From a commercial perspective, nothing is more telling than the recent import and export situation of various countries. The following table is based on data compiled by the League of Nations, using figures from the first half of each year as a benchmark.</p>
<p>Comparison of Import and Export Values of Various Countries in Recent Four Years (Unit: Millions of US Dollars)</p>
<p>|         | 1929    | 1930    | 1931    | 1932    |</p>

<p>| North America | 2,887   | 2,358   | 1,453   | 954     |</p>
<p>| Central and South America | 888     | 741     | 451     | 243     |</p>
<p>| Africa  | 425     | 398     | 108     | 205     |</p>

<p>| **Total** | 15,976  | 13,937  | 9,988   | 6,562   |</p>
<p>| **Exports** |         |         |         |         |</p>
<p>| Europe  | 7,538   | 6,988   | 5,126   | 3,330   |</p>
<p>| North America | 3,155   | 2,477   | 1,582   | 1,018   |</p>
<p>| Central and South America | 1,147   | 817     | 582     | 408     |</p>
<p>| Africa  | 430     | 361     | 305     | 281     |</p>
<p>| Asia    | 1,502   | 1,242   | 827     | 510     |</p>
<p>| Australia | 528     | 348     | 290     | 210     |</p>
<p>| **Total** | 14,300  | 12,233  | 8,712   | 5,757   |</p>
<p>Looking at the trade figures from recent years, both imports and exports have declined sharply. In North America, imports and exports have decreased by two-thirds in four years, while in Europe, the decrease is more than one-half. Asia, Africa, Australia, and South America have also experienced decreases ranging from one-half to two-thirds.</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding industry, the average index has fallen from 107 to 74 in the last four years, a decrease of 31%. If Soviet Russia is excluded, the index would drop to 67, a decrease of 37%. The following table lists important countries:</p>

<p>| World (Excluding Russia) | 107   | 93    | 81    | 67    |</p>
<p>Finally, regarding agricultural products, the prices of various agricultural products in both capitalist countries and colonies/semi-colonies have drastically decreased in recent years. "Abundance in a famine year" has become a common phenomenon. The following table shows the standard prices of food in major cities since the onset of the economic panic (Unit: Cents).</p>

<p>Observing the examples of world agriculture, industry, and commerce, it is evident that the panic has reached a dead end.</p>
<p>Naturally, when faced with such a difficult situation, everyone hopes for the arrival of an ideal land of hope. Therefore, at the Lausanne Conference last year, everyone excitedly advocated: "We must overcome the global economic panic and revive the global economic system." The fifth resolution of the Lausanne Conference stated:</p>
<p>"This conference believes that to resolve the economic and financial difficulties and prevent the global economic panic from prolonging, the League of Nations should convene a conference on currency and economic issues."</p>
<p>Today is the first day of the World Economic Conference. Is it possible for this conference to overcome the global economic panic? It is unlikely that anyone believes so. Not only can it not overcome the global economic panic, but even the simplest credit policies, price equalization, and production and trade coordination problems are unlikely to be resolved. The key to easing the global economic panic lies primarily in war debts, disarmament, and tariffs. Although there are other major reasons for the formation of the global economic panic, if the above three issues can be properly addressed, it may allow countries to temporarily rest easy. However, even these three issues are difficult to resolve. Let's examine the fate of this economic conference based on these three issues.</p>
<p>Why is the war debt issue such a critical key in this conference? The fundamental reason for the sharpening economic panic in recent years is the natural emergence of contradictions in capitalism. However, Germany, burdened by reparations to the victorious European nations, is overwhelmed and unable to bear the weight. This also affects the economies of other countries. High tariff barriers and the implementation of inflationary policies are directly and indirectly related to the economic panic in various countries. The only way out is to revise the Treaty of Versailles and reduce reparations. However, France and Britain also owe the United States huge war debts. Repayments of war debts depend on Germany, so the United States must be willing to reduce war debts before allowing Germany to change its reparations. However, the preparatory meeting at the White House in Washington not only failed to allow representatives from Britain and France to discuss the war debt issue, but also made tariff truce a difficult issue due to the United States' announcement of inflationary policies. Therefore, the war debt issue cannot be included in the agenda of this economic conference. Even the United States has clearly expressed its unwillingness to negotiate this issue. The Lausanne Conference was triggered by the war debt issue, but the economic conference cannot discuss the fundamental issue. This clearly becomes the first major obstacle in the economic conference.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is disarmament. The only difficulty point for the current economic panic in various countries is the expansion of military spending. Imperialist countries, whether for invading other countries or defending against resistance in their colonies, require significant expenditures to expand their military equipment. Before the global economic panic occurred, it was not too difficult to scrape together military funds. However, now, due to the bankruptcy of agriculture, industry, and commerce, income has become a major issue. At the same time, with Japan forcefully occupying the four northeastern provinces of China, the Soviet Union's five-year plan completed, and pan-nationalism in Italy and Germany completed, imperialist countries clearly know that military expenditures must be reduced. However, they all harbor ulterior motives and are unwilling to make any cuts. Therefore, the Geneva Disarmament Conference, even with Britain's MacDonald personally leading the charge and the United States' Roosevelt mediating, is clearly coming to an end. The failure of the Disarmament Conference reflects that the World Economic Conference will also have no results. These two important conferences are interconnected and were convened by the League of Nations!</p>
<p>Finally, let's discuss the tariff issue. Regarding tariffs, we recall that at the First International Economic Conference in Geneva six years ago, in 1927, it was widely believed that the tariff barriers of various countries were the most significant obstacle to international commodity circulation. Almost unanimously, it was resolved to abolish these tariff barriers. However, what has been the phenomenon in recent years? Please see the following table:</p>
<p>Table of Total Import Amounts and Tariff Rates of Various Countries Over the Past Six Years</p>
<p>| Year    | United States | United Kingdom | France | Germany |</p>
<p>| :------ | :------------ | :------------- | :----- | :------ |</p>
<p>| 1927   | 14.2          | 10.2           | 4.9    | 8.6     |</p>
<p>| 1928   | 13.8          | 11.2           | 6.8    | 8.4     |</p>
<p>| 1929   | 13.7          | 10.8           | 7.6    | 8.4     |</p>
<p>| 1930   | 15.9          | 11.6           | 8.3    | 8.4     |</p>
<p>| 1931   | 17.9          | 15.2           | 14.4   | 11.1    |</p>
<p>| 1932   | 20.3          | 23.1           | 18.3   | 16.0    |</p>
<p>In recent years, the speed at which various countries have increased tariffs has broken historical records. Although the United States proposed a tariff truce during the Economic Conference, the United States' implementation of inflationary policies has led to a trend for European countries to build even higher tariffs. Especially recently, the United States has adopted a comical approach, proposing a tariff truce on one hand, while limiting the import of important goods by utilizing inspection policies. At the same time, such as Britain's dealing with Japan, Japan is considering retaliating against Britain. While London is heatedly discussing how to achieve international coordination, everyone is going their own way.</p>
<p>Therefore, the purpose of this World Economic Conference is to seek international economic coordination and to overcome the global economic panic. The result is just everyone going through the motions. Each country is playing its own game, and the global economic panic is only deepening day by day.</p>
<p>The Currency Issue in the Economic Conference</p>
<p>Sanli</p>
<p>The World Economic Conference opened today at St. James's Palace in London.</p>
<p>The main agenda items of the conference include currency and credit policies, international exchange rates, prices, capital movement, improvement of production and trade, abolition of restrictions on international trade, and the tariff truce issue. Among these, the most important is the currency issue. Because without resolving the currency issue, not only can the credit system not be maintained, the exchange rates of international exchange cannot be stabilized, prices cannot be raised, capital cannot move freely, production and trade cannot be improved, restrictions on international trade cannot be abolished, but also the tariff war will represent the negotiations on international currency issues will begin on June 9.</p>
<p>To understand the currency issue in the conference, one must first have some concepts about currency.</p>
<p>Currency is an indispensable medium of exchange in a commodity production society. Its form of movement is:</p>
<p>Commodity → Currency → Commodity. This is the inevitable form of movement of the contradiction of commodity production. As long as the commodity production society does not collapse, the circulation of currency will not cease.</p>
<p>Since currency is an indispensable medium of exchange in a commodity production society, its necessary amount of circulation should be inversely proportional to the value of the currency itself, and directly proportional to the quantity of commodities in circulation and the size of their value and price, and inversely proportional to the size of the velocity of circulation of a unit of currency. If the amount of currency in circulation exceeds this necessary limit, the surplus part will either become hoarded currency or be exported abroad; conversely, hoarded currency will be recirculated or currency will be imported from abroad. In this case, it is easy to cause price fluctuations.</p>
<p>As the scope of exchange expands, coinage arises in response to the times. The unit of coinage differs from country to country. Currency units that can circulate in country A cannot circulate in country B, and currency units that can circulate in country B cannot circulate in country A. Therefore, in international trade, the form of currency circulation has to take the following form:</p>
<p>Commodity of Country A → Currency of Country B → Currency of Country A → Currency of Country B → Commodity of Country B. In this case, international exchange becomes an indispensable stage in the process of international trade.</p>
<p>The content of the currency issue in the conference, summarized, is two key points:</p>
<p>(1) An attempt to adopt an international currency to stabilize the exchange rates of international exchange. Regarding the first key point, we know that the current price decline is the result of overproduction and reduced consumption, which is a defect of the essence of capitalism, and is by no means caused by the influence of currency circulation. During the panic period, the reason why prices fell was that on the one hand, there was overproduction, and on the other hand, the increase in labor productivity led to a decrease in the value of commodities and a drop in prices. In this case, the increase in the value of currency is not due to the fact that currency is less than the necessary amount of circulation, but because of the decline in matter. Therefore, if an inflationary policy is adopted, using artificial force to reduce the value of currency and raise prices, although it can have a partial and temporary effect in the domestic market, in the international market, because the tariff war cannot cease, the inflationary policy not only cannot solve the current panic, but also makes international economy more entangled.</p>
<p>There are three forms of inflation: credit expansion, reduction of exchange rate parity, and issuance of paper money. We still do not know which form the conference will adopt for inflationary policies, but judging from the trend of the world economy, the credit system has not only not seen expansion but has instead increasingly shrunk. The fall in international exchange rate parity has also become gradually useless because the major gold standard countries have abandoned the gold standard one after another. As for issuing paper money, it can make paper money become inconvertible paper money and cause greater problems.</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding the second key point, the level of international exchange rate parity has a very significant impact on international trade. Currently, among the countries that still maintain the gold standard, other than France, there are only Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, and Italy. Because of the inconsistency of currency units, and because of the capitalist Greek country's monopoly of the financial market, international exchange rate parity fluctuates from time to time, which is a major obstacle to international trade. To remove this obstacle, it is essential to determine the exchange rate parity of international exchange. According to the Washington telegram from the National Society on June 7, the United States will propose at the conference to adopt a virtual gold unit as the standard for the parity of currencies of various countries, with the aim of stabilizing the exchange rate parity of international exchange.</p>
<p>Whether this issue can be passed by the conference depends on the attitude of various countries towards the currency issue.</p>
<p>In September 1931, Britain abandoned the gold standard, and the international exchange rate parity of the pound fell sharply. In November of last year, it even fell to a pound sterling valued at 3 dollars, 1 dime, and 5 cents plus sixteen-tenths of a cent, setting an unprecedented record. The reason why Britain adopted this policy was also to implement a method of inflation, using this as a weapon to compete with the United States for economic hegemony. Who knew that Japan also followed suit and abandoned the gold standard, and as a result, the depreciation of the Japanese yen was even greater than that of the pound sterling, causing great damage to British commerce in the Far East. And recently, the United States has also passed a bill to abolish the gold standard. From then on, the US dollar can compete with the pound sterling in depreciating and compete for world economic hegemony. From this point of view, imperialists are competing to use the depreciation of exchange rate parity to compete for the world market. How can they be willing to determine the exchange rate parity to reduce the method of competition?</p>
<p>As for whether international inflation can be implemented, it should be determined by whether the tariff war can be stopped. The tariff war has always been a weapon for the United States to compete for economic hegemony. However, since the abolition of the gold standard, the exchange rate parity of the US dollar has fallen, and this weapon is no longer very useful. Therefore, Roosevelt advocated a tariff truce. However, for European countries, in order to jointly resist the depreciation of the US dollar and prevent the United States from expanding its market in Europe, there is a strong trend to maintain tariff barriers and jointly confront the United States. Japan in East Asia is also planning to increase the import tax on British goods as retaliation for Britain and India increasing the import tax on Japanese goods. In this case, it is probably not an easy thing to solve the current panic through international inflation.</p>
<p>From White House Talks to the London Economic Conference</p>
<p>Balun</p>
<p>The World Economic Conference, which has been postponed repeatedly, finally opened today (June 12, 1933) at 3 pm in London, England. Sixty-five countries are participating. All national representatives, experts, and consultants participating in this conference number more than 2,000, showing the importance and eager expectations that various countries place on this World Economic Conference.</p>
<p>A month before the conference, there was first an international consultation at the White House in the United States. US President Roosevelt invited representatives from Britain, France, Germany, Japan, and our country to the White House in Washington to talk multiple times. Originally, this White House talk seemed to be able to ease the conflicts between the imperialists and give the London Conference a lot of hope. Unexpectedly, this was a tactic of Roosevelt's. He just wanted to use the White House talk to establish the United States' position in the World Economic Conference and expose the contradictions between the imperialists even more. It is anticipated that the results of this London Economic Conference will probably not be as satisfactory as we would like!</p>
<p>What were the results of this White House talk? Official reports are so vague that it is difficult for us to explore the truth. However, there are a few things that deserve our attention.</p>
<p>First, the United States announced the abandonment of the gold standard. This is not only a major blow to Britain, France, and Japan, but also a fatal blow to international coordination.</p>
<p>Since the British and Japanese, the price of the British pound has fallen sharply. Their goal is nothing more than to maintain a competitive trade situation in the Far East market. However, Britain's biggest trade rival is the United States. The devaluation of the pound is also the only weapon to fight the United States. Who knew that Roosevelt would announce an inflationary policy and ban gold exports on MacDonald's way to the United States, causing the US dollar to depreciate. MacDonald went to the United States, originally wanting to ask Roosevelt to cancel war debts and reduce protective tariffs, but in fact, it was completely impossible. The result was still going back with disappointment.</p>
<p>Similarly, French representative Herriot also wanted to use the joint maintenance of the gold standard by the United States and France as an exchange condition for canceling war debts when he went to Washington. However, the United States is now voluntarily abandoning the gold standard. How can Herriot open his mouth?</p>
<p>Second, before the opening of the London Economic Conference, the United States suddenly raised the banner of a tariff truce. In recent years, the United States has built tariff barriers and sealed off its own market. Why did it suddenly sing the high tune of a tariff truce again? This is because it has a new and effective weapon, the depreciation of the US dollar. Naturally, the old one can be abandoned. When it comes to various countries, since 1930, they have all implemented new tariff regulations. They were unwilling to abolish them rashly. In addition, with the depreciation of the US dollar, there is a danger of invading the markets of various countries. Various countries are even more unwilling to release their economic weapons.</p>
<p>Third, the agenda items proposed for discussion at the London Economic Conference are: (1) Currency and credit policies; (2) Prices; (3) Capital movement issues; (4) Restrictions on international trade; (5) Tariff and agreement policies; (6) Organization of production and trade. In fact, these issues are directly or indirectly closely related to the currency system. Various countries also commonly understand this point. Therefore, when Roosevelt talked to representatives of various countries at the White House, he mentioned methods such as raising the price of silver and the use of gold and silver reserves by central banks of various countries. His main point seemed to be to implement an international inflationary policy. When it comes to this policy, because it is difficult to maintain the exchange rate parity of various countries, it is probably not easy to do so. The White House talk has already revealed the ulterior motives of various capitalist countries. Although the Economic Conference held in London today has opened, what about the ending? I am afraid that it will be as bleak and pessimistic as the World Economic Conference in Geneva in 1927!</p>
<p>Difficulties of the World Economic Conference</p>
<p>Chu</p>
<p>US President Roosevelt, in order to solve the unresolved issues of the Lausanne Conference and rescue the world economy from panic, convened a World Economic Preparatory Conference in Washington to prepare for the official conference in London. Its main agenda items were international issues such as war debts, disarmament, tariffs, and exchange rates. Among them, the war debt and disarmament issues are particularly important for the world economy. President Roosevelt, in view of the changing domestic and international situation, had to seek solutions. However, this matter is of great importance, and it would be difficult to proceed without prior contact with various countries. Therefore, on April 8, he began preparatory talks with representatives of various countries. The proposals of this preparatory conference focused on the restoration of trade freedom and international currency. Other political issues such as war debts and disarmament were also within the scope of discussion.</p>
<p>The initial consultation was with Britain, during which the following seven major economic recovery proposals were put forward: (1) Raising world prices; (2) Reforming commercial policies; (3) Reforming trade restrictions; (4) Expanding world credit; (5) Government spending; (6) Rebuilding the international currency standard; (7) Raising the price of silver. It is said that the two sides had some understanding. Next, discussions were held with France on issues such as war debts, currency, and disarmament. A joint statement was also agreed upon on April 28, such as eliminating obstacles to international trade such as tariffs, imports, and exchange rates, raising world prices, and restoring economic conditions. The opinions of the two sides gradually became consistent. Other joint statements with Canadian representatives increased the exchange of goods and restored the international currency standard; economic disarmament and military disarmament were exchanged with Italian representatives; the disarmament issue was discussed with German representatives; and the silver issue was exchanged with representatives from Mexico. Generally, there was an understanding in principle, but the agreement on specific figures will have to wait for the decision at the London Conference. This is a general overview of the Washington Conference.</p>
<p>However, during the consultation, the United States suddenly stopped the gold standard, Britain increased the exchange rate balance fund, Germany demanded military equality, and Britain and France increased tariff rates. Various major problems occurred one after another. The reason for this is nothing more than using it as a means of concession and containment at the official London Conference. Therefore, although the United States has first advocated the tariff truce proposal, it is still questionable whether other countries can make concessions to each other and form a specific agreement. As for the economic situation of various countries, it is quite difficult to establish mutual tariff agreements and reduce tax rates in practice, because all countries regard tariff revenue as the only source of finance and as a tool to protect their domestic industries. Once reduced, finance and society will inevitably be greatly affected. Moreover, since the establishment of the Ottawa Agreement last year, Britain has completed the preferential tariff policy. If the tariff link is now lifted, it will inevitably shake the foundation for the revitalization of British industry. If Britain wants to respond to the United States' requirements, there must be war debt issues and other things as exchange prices. As for France, it is even more so than the United States. Because of Germany's Hitler policy, France defends against Germany's revenge every day. Therefore, on the one hand, economic issues are used to demand political security guarantees, and on the other hand, due to the low price of the circle, the payment of war debts is rejected. Therefore, it is difficult to predict to what extent the so-called tacit understanding between Britain, the United States, and France will reach, and whether major disputes will not occur at the London Conference.</p>
<p>Especially for the war debt issue, the United States advocated separate discussions, while Britain, France, and other countries believed that war debts were related to disarmament, and insisted that if the United States did not make concessions, they would refuse to pay. However, the total amount of European war debts to the United States is 11.5 billion yuan. If the debts that are due are delayed and not paid, the finances will become more difficult. Therefore, they are unwilling to give up their original rights. If the United States does not make concessions, it will inevitably trigger other problems due to war debts. Moreover, the safety of exchange rates is entirely determined by war debts. If exchange rates are shaken, there is no way to solve various economic problems.</p>
<p>Next is disarmament. Today, the world needs about 8 billion in military equipment. Due to the expansion of military equipment by various countries, the national deficits of countries and finances have been increasing year by year, and even most of the annual income is used for military expenses. If reductions are not implemented, then the huge military expenditures that do not produce will affect the foundation of a country's finances. However, the national conditions of various countries are different, and the international situation is chaotic. France is wary of Germany and Italy, and Japan is wary of the United States and Russia. They are all eyeing each other, and crises are lurking. They are all trying to enrich their national defenses, and it is practically impossible to implement restrictions and reductions. Even aggressive countries want to overthrow the Treaty of Versailles, destroy the London and Washington disarmament restrictions, and are determined to expand. Although the United States has the intention to eliminate the scourge of war, it is impossible to solve it with the independent policies of one country due to the vested interests of various countries. Moreover, once disarmament is implemented and the manufacture of warships and weapons is stopped, the number of unemployed people will increase. If these unemployed people are transferred to other productions, the amount of production will become more excessive. Since last year, the prices of agricultural products in various countries have plummeted, and the sales of industrial products have been stagnant. It is even more impossible to deal with so many newly unemployed people.</p>
<p>Finally, the currency issue is even more complicated. The so-called equalization of prices, the central banking system, the currency standard system, the silver price issue, and the exchange rate restriction issue are all related, and the currency system and financial industry conditions of various countries vary. Since the natures are different, it is difficult to change. Even a slight carelessness can affect the safety of the entire country.</p>
<p>From this point of view, it is not easy to find a common point of advantages and disadvantages in a complicated situation. Therefore, although the United States has the ambition to reverse the world economic panic, it is feared that various countries will be difficult to implement their original intentions according to the predetermined plan due to their own interests. It is hoped that all countries will abandon their prejudices and make concessions to each other to establish international coordination in this important conference, so that all human beings in the world can enjoy peace and prosperity.</p>

<p>The home of Zhu Runzhi, the town head of Fengsheng Town in the fourth district of the county, was suddenly invaded by six bandits at approximately 9 PM the night before last. They broke down the door and ransacked the place. As they left, they kidnapped his twelve-year-old son, fired a shot, and fled eastward with a whooping cry.</p>

<p>Jin Tigan, the Administrative Inspector Commissioner of the Fourth District of Songhu-Suzhou Province, arrived in Qingpu at 4 PM the day before yesterday with five investigators to inspect county administration. Shen, the County Magistrate, and others welcomed him. After arriving at the county government, he met with representatives from various agencies, inquired about the county's affairs in detail. At 9 AM the next morning, he convened a meeting with leaders of various agencies and organizations at the county government. In the afternoon, he inspected various agencies in the town. Today, he will inspect the Second District and is scheduled to return to Songjiang and then to Jinshan County.</p>

<p>In Beidan Town, there are nine butcher shops. They were required to pay 150 yuan per month in taxes, calculated at one and a half pigs per shop per day. Due to the sharp decline in rice prices at the end of last year and the resulting slump in business, four shops closed. The remaining shops requested a tax reduction from Jiang Penghai, the contractor, who verbally agreed. However, without written guarantee, Jiang suddenly petitioned the county (on the 6th) requesting the arrest of the five remaining butchers in Beidan Town to recover back taxes. The county government approved the dispatch of bailiffs to summon them for questioning and demand payment. The butchers painfully and reluctantly paid the arrears. However, after returning to the town, they went on strike, vowing not to reopen until a tax reduction was achieved. Representatives from the district office and the county chamber of commerce have been sent to persuade them, but as of the 9th, they have not resumed business.</p>

<p>Ding Mengxin, a Shanghai merchant, had built a residence at No. 3 Yanling Road, near the West Lake in Hangzhou. Because Ding spent little time in Hangzhou, the house was managed by Lin Youkang, and four people including the chauffeur Zhong Qishi lived there. Unexpectedly, on the 6th of this month, two gold rings and more than ten pieces of clothing were stolen from Lin's wife's room. Zhong Qishi was suspected of the theft, and the Provincial Detective Squad was notified. After an investigation by Squad Leader Tang Shih and Detective Zhu Bingrong, the entire group was brought to the station for questioning. However, Zhong vehemently denied the theft. Lin suddenly claimed that his wife, Lin Mi, had been raped several times. Squad Leader Tang immediately summoned Lin Mi for questioning. She testified that she had been repeatedly raped by Zhong Qishi three times. On the 26th of last month, Lin had discovered the act. I knelt down and begged, but the matter was not resolved. Out of shame and remorse, I attempted suicide in my room but was rescued. When Zhong Qishi was questioned again, he vehemently denied the theft but vaguely admitted to the adultery. Squad Leader Tang, considering the case involved both theft and adultery, forwarded it to the Provincial Public Security Bureau for further investigation.</p>
