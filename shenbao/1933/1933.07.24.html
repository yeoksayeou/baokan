<h3>中國與國聯技術合作之反響</h3>
<p>中國與國聯之技術合作。自提議以來歷時已逾兩年。及至最近。一方因」國聯行政院中國技術合作委員會「在巴黎集議之結果。决定合作節圍。並派遣拉西曼氏爲聯絡員。有積極進行之勢。一方則在遠東。引起嚴重之反響日本外務省訓令其駐外各使。以」不辭再取滿洲上海兩事變一類之自衛行爲「等語句。恫嚇各國放棄助華政策。大足顯示此項反響之不容忽視。中國與國聯技術合作之具體計劃。在未經全部公布以前。吾人自無從詳悉其内容。據南京傳出消息。合作興辦之事業。大致爲建設重工業。治理水利。鐵道合作。衛生新設施。改良農業等。巴黎會議又議定」全然技術的而非政治的「之合作原則。自表面言。中國人民。對於政府舉。似不必從根本上加以反對。惟在世界經濟會議失敗。列强遠東經濟競爭加劇之時。此項大規模之國際合作事業。即使無政治的共管危機。亦足引歐美經濟帝國主義之各種勢力深入中國。造成未來之困難問題。中國有識人土。於此關係國運之重大事件。固多於利害得失之間。埋首研究。初未必因需要合作之大勢。而即貿</p>
<p>然一律贊同之也。</p>
<p>今我中國國内。未有若何表示。而與中國爲敵之日本。則已起而反對。其反對理由。以日本與中國之特殊關係。及日本在亞洲之地位爲根據。已明示其亞洲門羅主義之野心。爲中國及國際所不能承認。至謂」中國舍近友（？）</p>
<p>而就遠圖。其含意仍爲所謂以夷制夷之政策。「則尤可謂竭盡挑撥離間之能事。九一八瀋陽事變。以日本嫉視國聯通過建設中國十年計劃案。爲其發動原因之一。吾人前已論及之矣。（見本月五日時評）今日本外務省之言曰。」若因各國助華而。惹起中國决行。反滿抗日行爲。則日本不辭再取滿洲上海兩事變一類之自衛行爲。「駐華日使館發言人則謂。」若萬一有政治</p>
<p>作用之表現。···釀成第二滿洲國之出現。第二上海事變之發生。非任何人所能保證其必無。「然則日本其欲借此向世界各國宣戰乎。日本此次作反對行動及發威嚇言詞。其根本之錯誤。在於看定國聯之巽懦與中國有歐美派日本派之分。國聯是否持續巽懦態度。因日本之反對威嚇而改變與中國合作之政策。吾人不欲推論。惟在中國。則除少數漢奸外。絶無人可供日本利用。則觀於最近人民之心理。可以明白。雖然。吾人關於對國家重大問題之利害研究。亦殊不能因日本此次行爲之影響而有所顧忌也。</p>

<h3>外務省與軍部决定所謂對華自守强硬論</h3>

<h3>我與國聯合作</h3>
<p>日本惶慮情見乎辭</p>
<p>（東京）外務省與軍部方面已經决定方針、日本對華政策以自守的靜觀主義爲主、中日停戰恊定成立後、企圖在華北强化此方針、然至最近、傳聞中國出席世界經濟會議之代表宋子文氏與美國訂立棉麥借欵五千萬元、又英國金融團進行五百萬鎊借欵之合同說、宋氏又與張學良恊議之結果、與歐洲各國訂立購入武器合同、因此日本政界之一部觀察、宋氏回國後、國民政府之歐美派壓迫日本派、再向排日政策轉移、故日本亦應於國聯對華技術合作委員渡華之前、實行某種諒解運動之說漸次有力、然外務省與軍部因抱如下見解、决意堅持旣定之靜觀主義、㈠中國之事大主義及以夷制夷之對外政策、列國自從華盛頓會議以來、均有苦痛經騐、故日本不得不以强硬態度對付中國、㈡日本自九一八事件發生後、至本年五月末、中日停戰交涉成立之時爲止、消費巨額經費與貴重的國民犧牲之結果、覺得對華政策之根幹在於自守强硬之一途然至今竟有人主張軟論、政府絶對避免採用如此軟化的對華政策、㈢因此、如列國將來對華實行不當的援助政策、以使中國内政混亂、則日本斷然須要排除列國此種政策、同時對於國聯對華合作委員之活動、加以嚴重警戒、㈣列國雖於表面上與華提携、然日本决不派任何有力代表至中國、積極請求中國政府握手、日本始終以自守獨行之强硬方針對付中國、（二十三日日聯電）</p>

<h3>故宮舞弊案調查未圓滿　　瑾</h3>
<p>易培基將返平辦理交代</p>
<p>張繼遷移古物繁榮西安</p>
<p>北平發現最高法院院長文電</p>
<p>北平通訊、全國屬目之故宮舞弊案、經監察委員周利生·高友唐等來平調查後、尙未得圓滿結果、前故宮博物院院長易培基、不日由滬返平、辦理交代事宜、各情分誌如次、</p>
<h3>易氏行踪</h3>
<p>故宮博物院前院長易培基、久居就滬、自故宮古物第一批運往上海後、不久易氏即南下、在京滬一帶會商古物保存辦法、旋因外傳故宮秘書長李宗侗有舞弊嫌疑、李氏聞悉後、憤慨異常、一方面自動辭去秘書長職務、同時代表易培基擬就辭呈、呈請准予辭職、故宮博物院理事會於十五日在南京勵志社開全體理事會議、對院長易培基辭職照准、以理事兼古物館長馬衡代理、理事長李煜瀛辭職亦照准、公推張人傑爲理事長、新代理院長馬衡於閉會後即赴滬、視察木箱中之飛蛾、據北平故宮博物院秘書處消息、易培基於一星期内返平、辦理交代事宜、並宣佈外傳之舞弊案眞相、</p>
<h3>案情内幕</h3>
<p>據故宮方面傳出消息、中央委員張繼與李煜瀛交誼頗深、與易培基則稍有誤會、當平津危急之時、故宮古物南運、張繼主張將古物全部運往西北、而當時之代理行政院院長宋子文反對此辦法、張氏乃又以西京籌備委員會名義、向行政院長汪兆銘建議、請將故宮文獻圖書二館文籍移至西安、汪已將此種建議電平、徵求意見、至於張繼夫人崔震華女士向南京最高法院控告故宮博物院前院長易培基、最初僅指出售古物之時間問題、即說明非星期日出售古物之非法、認爲非星期日出售古物、估價有不公平之處繼因各方之援助、周利生高友唐遂來平調查眞相、當時周高兩監委並未向故宮博物院調查、但向北平地方法院有所洽商因未得圓滿結果、故高友唐擬於下月初、再行來平視察、實則張易之感情隔閡、亦多因極小之人事而起也、</p>
<h3>汪兆銘電</h3>

<h3>反對分院</h3>
<p>記者昨訪開心故宮之考古家高孝、據談如下、本年春間、行政院令將故宮十分之七八最有價値之古物南運時、民衆曾發生兩種疑問、㈠古物是否要抵押或拍賣、㈡假若不抵押、亦不拍賣、華北安定後、是否將運回北平、對於第一個疑慮、業已消釋、然而古物已將陸續分散在南京上海西安、聞之失望、據汪院長談、我國博物院僅在平一個、甚不妥、使有幾個分館、一處如遇兵燹、即可移至他方試問倫敦博物院有幾個分館、假如將古物運回北平、將來華北再遇兵燹、是否可以再移至他方、京滬近海、西省多匪、是否比北平穩妥、京滬西安適當的地址、必須新建分院、政府是否有此一筆錢、即或能籌到此筆鉅欵、是否應當用在次要之事情云云、</p>
<h3>監員調查</h3>

<p>黄氏首稱余於本　　年初出國迄今歷時凡四月、按當時原定計劃、預期考察爲一年、惟因中途聞國内消息、益多艱難、而各國人士、亦以統率空軍之航空署長、在茲國内有事之秋、不在國内作戰、反好整以暇、於此時在外考察、引以爲怪、且身在國外、反視國内似所見與感觸、較之在國内尤爲深切、余受此刺激、遂不得不縮短時間、作速返國、惟此行倍蒙各國優渥招待、結果甚稱圓滿、初出國時、首至意之羅馬、歷時有三週、繼乃至英法德三國、在此考察期内、終日碌碌、頗鮮暇𠷳、蓋自淸晨八時起、直至晚間八時、方得休息、所注意考察者、係關於航空上之行政·組織·技術·效率·等等、以資爲我國將來借鏡、現各國空軍、皆有猛速之進步、殊堪驚人、蓋各國當歐戰之時、視飛機尙祇是海陸軍之耳目、其時飛程亦至多不過數百里、所用炸彈、亦祗二十鎊、迨歐戰停後、各國因對於飛機加以逐步之改良、精益求精、覺其效力、旣能横渡大海、又可飛越高嶺、若佐之以巨量炸彈、則其神速與燬壞力、遠在軍艦大砲之上、故各國遂莫不舉上下通力合作以競爭航空建設、當時各國數量、最多數十架而已、今則已增數千架矣、且飛機效力之猛力、尤足驚人、昔日行程數百里者、今則已可横渡太平洋矣、昔者載炸彈、至多重二十鎊者、今則可載至八千鎊矣、此種戰鬥利器、較之歐戰時德國以七十二生的大砲、射遠一百五六十里以攻撃巴黎者、其相差又不知凡幾、故今後兩國交戰、在哀的美敦書發出後之數小時内、可使敵國之政治軍事經濟、大都巿之各中心區燬滅殆盡、是故各國現在莫不鈎心鬥角、擴充空軍之力量與設備、以期競雄於世、余信今後之戰爭、破壞必較前爲甚、時間必較前爲短、决不致再有如歐戰時之長期拖延也、</p>
<h3>各國航空近狀</h3>
<p>至於各國航空建設之近狀、無日不在進步之中、惟各國因環境不同、地形互殊、故可稱之謂各有長處、如英國因係島國、其海軍素著名於全球、故其空軍設備、皆在地面、且較任何一國爲鞏固、其政府每年以一千七百萬鎊英金爲空軍軍費、現英國航空部飛機約有七百架、飛機製造工廠全國林立、民辦者皆由政府補助、在必要時、政府令下、皆能依樣製造、供政府應用、航空人才、亦比比皆是、法國爲世界著名陸軍國家、飛機數量、現爲各國冠、人民所備、有如我國自備汽車、意國自墨索里尼執政後、自兼航空署長、努力提倡、至最近常備者數千架、工廠除小規模不計外、大者有七家、全受政府管轄其飛行速率、亦居世界首位、德國現雖因凡爾賽條約之束縛、未能發展、惟觀其内部凖備、亦足驚人、况德之機械、優勝各國、設有機會、必能見其有特殊之表現、</p>
<h3>計劃供獻中央</h3>
<p>繼云、各國之空　　軍建設旣如彼、而我國近來受日本之侵凌又如是、故今後全國上下、亟須從速覺悟、以從事航空運動、若最近之航空救國、即一提倡航空之好現象、據余主張、以我國輻圓之廣闊、海口之洞開、至少須有一千七百架常備機同時集中訓練人才、將陸軍二百萬縮編、以節彼挹此地方治安、則以提高警察學識、以代替地方軍隊、而後盡力做去、庶足以抗敵禦侮、至於詳細計劃、余將着手草擬、以便貢獻中央備爲採擇云云、</p>

<h3>新鮮花紅香蕉</h3>
<p>奇案發生之　　日、一時哄　　動附近、觀者頗衆、據稱有一賣大餅油條之小孩、在該弄撞見一年約十歲身穿黄布衣服之女孩、手持油煎餃、似將進棧、倐忽不見、該孩逢人便告、知者漸多、而謠言亦愈傳愈盛、或有謂日前常在該棧左右見一白髪老人、或稱曾見該棧走出兩個女子、躍入浦中、忽然不見云云、莫衷一是、惟欲探究賣大餅之小孩、則至今並無下落、但空棧發現食物、確係奇事、難以知其底蘊、故一經報載、翌日觀者益衆、或竟有遠道來者、自早至暮、絡繹不絶、詎事有凑巧、是日（即前日）接續在棧内發現新鮮蘋果·花紅·香蕉·等水菓甚多、於是觀者益爲驚疑、稱謂狐仙之說更甚、</p>

<p>第五章醫藥之行政第三節近年之政令民國十八年’衛生部成立’各項政令也最熱閙’部長薛篤弼’自然是政治上一種支配，次長劉瑞恒’是個内行’就是北政府内務部衛生司做過的。然而他們二位’爲集思廣益起見’徵集醫藥界名流’組織中央衛生委員會’在南京開了好幾天會議’决定了許多衛生行政的大綱’而取締新舊醫藥’自然也在議案之内。中央衛生委員裏面’除政府的當然委員外’有幾位是上海醫師公會和中華醫學會中華民國醫藥學會的中堅份子’然而當時會議’都並沒有偏見遷就上海’着實相度全國形勢’對於醫師開業登記决定了二條大綱∶㈠新醫登記凡在民國十八年以前已經縣牌行醫的’一律無條件登記∶㈡舊醫登記凡在民國十九年以前已經開業者’一律無條件登記。（即使年齡滿二十歲者連學生也可預登記）至於當時目的’十九年以後全國醫者的產生’當然最好皆由學校畢業’即使眞不得已’或者再舉行一種國家考試’採取某種人材：再退一步說’即使要提倡中醫學校’要開倒車’要提倡授徒式的舊醫’只要潮流許可’也不妨重由國家明令舉辦’原沒有什麽不能。而以上的二項限制’無論如何’不妨碍目前各醫者的生計’而至少爲統一醫政立些根基。（按普通人開業年齡可以到六十歲以上。假定十八年十九年登記時醫者的年齡爲二十五歲。那麽這班人的職業。可以到三十五年之久’也可算審慮周詳’天經地義了。）然而這個議案發表之後’就來一個軒然大波’第一舊醫們由上海發難’首先說這是摧殘舊醫’並且連合了舊藥舖’一致起來抗爭’總商會莫明其妙’也帮着國藥舖打電報’發議論’而時事新報的滄波先生’又大弄筆頭’說衛部之不當’好像大禍臨頭’國粹淪亡’民無噍類的神氣。其實照原案的宗旨看來’何嘗有什麽了不得呢。那時候國事紛亂’團體林立’有一班非學校畢業的新醫’恐怕政令正在醞釀的時候’萬一發生不利於他們的嚴政來’所以也趁這個當兒’聯合起來’組織了一個西醫公會’與醫師公會對峙’也要對於衛生行政’醫師條例’參加些意見’有人說’這種舉動’還是上年審查他們文憑的反響。換一句說’他們對於中央衛生委員會的議案’自己無學校文憑的’可以在十八年以前無條件登記’當不滿意’必須使無文憑的一類’也要續續產生’方才好另有一個天地’眞奇極了！然而這樣滿天星斗的一閙’閙成中醫沒有限制的登記’差不多衛部沒有考騐權’那時候不論何人’要得中醫證書’容易得狠’直到今天民國二十二年還是如此。一方面對於新醫呢’衛生部也沒有照中央衛生委員會議决案去做’不知怎樣產生了一種醫師暫行條例’條文之嚴格繁複’尤其不合國情’非學校畢業生’依舊拥在孫山之外’而事實上確有這一類醫者’又如何可以一字不提’寗可使中華西醫公會於是在法律以外宣告成立。這其間不曉得仰體那一位老的憲意。造成畸形的政見如下：㈠好像對於中醫是提倡國粹而濫造：㈡對於新醫之學校畢業者’差不多認爲洋務人員’外國貨’貴族用品’取締得嚴些’而令成精品：㈢對於新醫之非學校出身者’只當沒有看見’這種政令的結果’到底造成今日之混亂狀况</p>
<h3>論醫學敎育中普通敎育之重要</h3>
<p>— 憑公</p>
<p>查醫校四大學程。爲解剖’生理’病理’治療。而此四科之基礎。則建於物理’化學’生物’數學等。雖基本科學之學分多寡。各國不同。即國内敎育專家。對此亦往往意見不。然其爲醫學先修課程。固夫人而承認之。愚以爲基本科學。關於醫學。自極重要。但除此以外。普通敎育之根柢。初亦未可忽視。夫醫師操業。爲促進社會健康。直接間接。關係人種之强弱。國族之隆替。非如其他技術人員。僅以運用諳熟爲已足。是其先决問題。厥爲對人。社會之人。有長有幼。有貧有富。有智有愚。有賢有不肖。未可齊量而等觀之也。即就社會本體而論。有鄕村社會。有城巿社會。有都邑社會。而各級社會中際此敎育尙未普及。科學尚少認識之時。充滿迷信。愚妄。與偏執之心理。在在與業務推行。發行障礙。例如瘧疾。一般病者。不問其直接原因。而悞爲病魔作崇。不重診斷。而惟拜佛求神之是圖。其在童騃。固不足論。而通人相傳。亦有誦杜陵之詩。可以驅瘧。讀陳琳之檄。可以愈風之語。習非成是。莫可究詰。開業者。如果狃於本身之科學見解。不能善爲解說。欲於立談之間。舉其所迷信者。摧陷而廓淸之。其結果必至目的未逹。而種種困難。因以引起。例如社會恒言。西醫長於外科。而短於内科。中醫長於内科。而短於外科。所長不同。爲用各異。此種思相。深入人心。其理由試莫須有。其成見頗能左右一切。爲醫師者。苟於醫學原理。及我國固有醫訣。毫無研究。欲以直率之態度。鹵莽之語氣申辯之。鮮有不遭人之非難。而自趨絶路者。再如近年以來。各國成藥。競以中國爲尾閭。一般病者。往往惑廣告。以爲某藥能治頭痛者。甲有效乙必有效。某藥能治咳嗽者騐於丙必騐於丁。充類至盡。不可勝計。不問病源。惟知服藥。危險孰甚又如吾國醫師。派别甚多。病家心理。以爲某國爲醫藥先進之國。某校畢業之醫師。其學術自必較勝。不知醫學祇有科學與非科學之别。無德法英美日之别。以國際之界限。區别醫學之優劣反科學的心理。到處皆是。爲醫師者處此錯綜龐雜之環境。欲求業務上之順利。决非僅恃解剖生理等醫學知識所能辦到。必具有充分之常識。相當之才力。涵養之功夫。方足應用。而此皆有待於普通敎育。如文言。歷史。社會學。哲學。名學之類。爲之基本棄　則根榮實茂。應付有方。昔吾鄕有一婦人。患難產症。狃於家庭舊習。不欲送入醫院。正在危急之時。幸附近有一敎會醫院。西人某。聞其事。親携醫具登門診治。其時家人方在伏臘過年。禮神焚帛。怱忙萬狀。而彼西人。　恬不爲怪。但求接產。不問其他。結果　母子均安。　家感激。向之對於新醫懷疑者。今則變爲忠實信徒。非此醫師之學問人格。高人一等。曷克臻此。最近美國貝勒大學（ＢａｙＩｏｒＵｎｉｖｅｒｓｉｔｙ）莫桑（ＷａＩｔｅｒＨＭｏｎｒｓｕｎｄ）氏之調查。該校醫學生中。曾受文學士學位。因成績不良而退學者。佔百分之九·六及百分之一七·二八。而碩士則竟無其例。可見普通敎育。實爲醫學之基礎。其重要不减於物理化學等基本科學。謂予不信。請再以莫君之統計證之。莫君統計中。謂該校醫學生。普通成績在乙等（八十分）。而醫學成績不足因而退學者。爲百分之二·九。在丙等（七十分）爲一四·七。而在丁等（六十分）爲二二·五。觀此二種統計。益見普通敎育。訓練愈優。年限愈長。而醫學上之修習愈易反之普通敎育不足者。醫學上之研究愈難。觀察力因以廣淺。適應力因以薄弱以學者之地位。淪而爲技術者流。幾何其不蹈霍子孟不學無術之譏耶。西諺云。學識薄弱之人。走遍森林。終日不能覓火柴一株。此之謂乎夫並通敎育中。以文字爲首要。言之無文。行之不遠。最低限度。亦須寫作流暢。並能參考載籍。輓近世界各國醫校。對於語文程度。以法國爲最講求大抵學生升至大學。其本國文言。已極純粹。一旦畢業醫科。自能運用裕如。今茲吾國醫學生。除本國語文。應具根柢外。西洋文字中。如英法德三種。至少須通曉一種。因近代醫學中之重要書籍與雜誌。大致用此三國文字發表非有學力。無從瀏覽。此外尙有日文。與吾國醫學關係綦深。亦非涉獵不可。至若歷史社會學哲學名學等。雖與醫學非處處有關係。然藉以訓練常識。啓迪理智。陶冶性情。擴充見解。皆爲醫師出而問世之主要原素。查蘇俄敎育原則。首重社會的意識與形態。故學生在未習專科以前。其先修學程。自然科學與社會科學並重。使學生對於社會意識。先作相當之認識。此種兼籌並顧之主張。可謂得敎育之眞諦矣。今者人情世態。經緯萬端。苟於普通敎育。無相當培養。即曰專門技術。已可應用。然如何應用。並如何能行之有效。則鮮有把握。賢者進退兩難。窮於應付。黠者工於心計。惟利是圖。醫藥本身。民衆健康。殊受莫大打撃。不圖忽視普通敎育之流弊一至於此。有執行業務之技能。無執行業務之才具。主持醫學敎育者。幸勿徒造就僅具技術之醫匠可也</p>

<h3>科學的達生篇</h3>
<p>— 俞松筠</p>
<p>（二十六）</p>
<p>㈡㈩㈡哺乳的方法</p>
<p>（甲）哺乳的位置</p>
<p>產後母子二人’都很疲倦’應有數小時的安眼’可在醒後’再行哺乳’但是母乳的分泌’起初不很旺盛’假使嬰兒啼泣求乳’可以暫用消毒鎦水或水飴代之。</p>
<p>哺乳時’若是右乳房授乳’宜取右側臥位’同時母體肘部’支持兒體上半身’前　托看兒頭’然後以淸潔的食指中指’提撮乳頭’送入兒口’若是左乳授乳’依法取左側臥位。</p>
<p>小兒生後一星期内’哺乳宜取側臥位’因爲那時子宮的重量’尙未减輕’如果起坐頻仍’恐有子宮下垂脫落之虞’但在側臥位哺乳時’應防乳房杜塞乳兒的鼻孔’以致呼吸受碍’而遭窒息。</p>
<p>（乙）乳頭和手指</p>
<p>乳頭乃是直迭送入兒口的要部’最應淸潔’可用溫水或酒精拭凈’哺乳之後’亦須拭凈’若不淸潔’非但易起小兒口腔炎及腸胃病的弊害’並且頭乳暈’也易受損’如其細菌　入’則有乳腺炎的發現。</p>
<p>（丙）哺乳的時問</p>
<p>初生兒生後第一日内毋庸哺乳’以便安眼’若啼哭似欲求乳’可先給以’</p>
<p>少許的茶或糖湯。</p>
<p>母乳入小兒胃中’須經一小時半或二小時’方可消化。所以哺乳的間隔’須在二小時半以上：四五個月以後’因爲吸量增多’須隔三小時’再行哺乳’夜間須隔四五小時後’可哺一次。</p>
<p>哺乳時間’在健康的乳兒’不必嚴定一次的久暫’大抵哺至旣飽就眠爲止</p>
<p>’普通所需的時間’可據分泌的狀况’以及吮啜力的强弱’以爲分别’大都一刻至二十分鐘爲度。但有大多數的小兒’在五分鐘即可攝取大部份的乳汁’更有因爲乳汁充盈流溢的綠故’在一二分鐘’即可滿腹’所以不可一概而論。我國舊習’小兒偶有啼哭’即行授乳’誤認乳汁：含有止哭的效力’以致小兒胃内積乳太多’不易消化’胃腸受損’即起下痢嘔吐：甚而至於胃障碍’發生危險’豈可不愼嗎？</p>
<p>初生兒在生後十日内’哺乳量極少’因爲胃的容納還小’滿月以後’就可逐月漸增’現將十日内以及滿月後的哺乳時間次數哺量’分别立表如下：</p>
<p>生後十日内的哺乳表</p>

<h3>性病學自序</h3>
<p>— 夏愼初</p>
<p>古人有言。飲食男女。人之大慾存焉。誠哉是言也。有食慾則有生活。有性慾則有生育。食慾性慾者。生命之源也。斷絶飲食。途有餓殍。隔絶男女。人無噍類。飲食男女廢。而生生之道絶矣。動物求存而有鬥爭。所鬥所爭。唯食與性。蟋蟀之鬥。鷄狗之爭。禽獸昆虫之奮不顧身。交相殘殺者。唯求伸張其生命線耳。國家民族。團體個人之間。爭奪鬥狠。演而愈劇者。亦唯求伸張其生命線耳。生命線者。豈有他哉。食與性而已也。鬥智鬥力。不奪不巳。因果相循。報復無旣。人類之於爭鬥。亦有倦而知返者乎。道曰知足。佛曰戒殺。孔曰寡慾。而世之貪　刦殺如故。宗敎敎育之力。於是乎窮。中山之民生主義。歐美之戀愛自由。欲以政治方案。滿足男女食飲之慾。使人各樂其業。安其所。平天下之不平。弭人間之禍亂。先覺覺人。仁者之用心也。然其成功則尙有待焉。爭之不能遂已。兵之不能遂弭也審矣。其所以不能已且弭者。何也。飲食男女之慾。所以處之尙不得其道也。福者禍所倚。生者殺之門。信矣。造物之不仁也夫。記曰。未有學養子而後嫁者也。動物方生而即能哺乳者。生而能之。不待夫知。司動之機。發軔於慾也。慾者生殺之機也。御之不得其道。則足以戕生。大而極於天下。小而止於一身。其義一也。飲鴆止渴。不必其爲鴆也。葡萄美酒。魚　異味。未嘗不足以戕生。吾人之死於飲食者夥矣。醫家之論詳矣。微獨飲食。外而髮膚。内而府藏。四肢百骸。無不可以受病。醫藉記載。亦群且盡矣。靡有遺矣。而吾所不能不引以爲怪者。醫家論病。而獨不及於性。豈非大缺憾乎。性官之複雜。不遜於消化器。性慾之易於衝動。亦不亞於飲食。然則性焉得而無病。性之疾病。不僅關於個人之健康。其影響所及。乃至於夫婦之情愛。社會之安寗。民族之强盛。關係之巨。豈在飲食下哉。余不自知其槧鄙。凡男女兩性之病。於其原因’病理’症狀’以及保養’療治之法。搜括羅輯。分别記述。診餘握槧。四載於茲。惜其用力之勤。而無以就敎於明達也。於是刋而行之。上以求海内有道之正。下以增進社會性事之常識。而知所珍攝。願世間男女。有室家之樂。遂生生之道。滋生向榮。不自戕殺。雖不足以息宇宙之大爭。或亦可以安小已之天命也乎。至於梅毒’白濁’及下疳等花柳病。乃發揮性慾之時。由不潔之性交而發生者也。近代醫家。亦有稱之爲性病者。然此非性慾本能上之疾病。不入本盡範圍。置而不講。覽者諒焉。</p>
<h3>新醫藥發達過程中幾個重要的發見和發明　（五）</h3>
<p>— 顧壽白</p>
<p>㈣微生物學和免疫學</p>
<p>自從顯微鏡發明了以後’纔有微生物學的發達’因微生物學的發達’綫引起免疫學的研究’所以這兩種學科也和題微鏡很有密切的關係。</p>
<p>現在的人們’差不多誰也知道有許多重要的疾病｜｜所謂傅染病｜｜是由肉眼所不能見必須用顯微鏡纔能看見的最小生物所惹起的。這些最小的生物統稱爲微生物。其中屢於植物性的’稱爲微菌：屬於動物性的’稱爲原蟲。微生物學就是研究這些微生物的形態和性質的學問。至於免疫學是研究人體内免疫物質的產生’性質和免疫方法的學問。　　微生物學的基礎是由法國的巴士特（ＬｏｕｉｓＰａｓｔｅｕｒ）和德國的科和（ＲｏｂｅｒｔＫｏｃｂ）兩氏所建設的’前者是豫防接種法的先覺’後者是傳染性病原菌的研究家’都有不朽的功績。</p>
<p>在巴氏以前’劉文赫氏也曾在顯微鏡下發見了原蟲’不久又發見了微菌。後來又有些人陸續發見了蠶的病原微生物’人胃内的田字菌’馬的脾脫疽菌及其芽胞。</p>
<h3>肺癆治瘉與否與體重增加之關係</h3>
<p>— 时筠者</p>
<p>肺癆病人當恢復期中。其體重之逐漸增加者。難爲病勢减退之一良好症候但亦並非一定。何則。蓋體重之增加有二種。一則其增加後爲永久不變動者。一則其增加爲暫時之現象。前者乃良好之症候。後者未必爲良證。蓋後者之體重。其所以暫時增加者。多因入療養院或轉地療養等變換其從來之生活法而來。復在良氣候處保守安靜。多服滋養物之故。如斯者不但病人爲然。即任何人依此行。亦可在短時日内增加其體重。此因一種之生活方法。使生理上發起體重之增加。並非因肺癆病全治而體重增加者也。此可以事實證明之。即令彼等退院或從轉地療養地返家。回復其從前之生活法時。則其增加之體。可在數月間内仍復减少。倘疾病果眞全治者。則其增加之體重。决無再减。是以知肺病治瘉之程度。與體重增加常相平行。</p>
<p>凡在自宅休養之病者。謹守肺病療養之方法。如注意於空氣·日光·安靜·營養等。（詳細請參觀拙譯肺病豫防療養敎則在四馬路作者盡社代售）雖無特别攝取豐富之滋養物。唯忍耐修養。或己在恢復期後之病者。每日稍稍執行業務。此等病者之體重增加。雖常遲。但其旣增加之體重。後來久不减少。疾病治瘉愈確實。體重亦愈一定。此何者。因患者在其久相習慣之生活居處。復不變其平素之生活狀態。善自休養故也。是以其體重之增加雖遲。而其增加之體重。即與疾病治瘉之程度。殆相平行者也。</p>
<p>昔時對於肺病患者。往往以濫與多量之滋養物爲適宜。此實誤再者也。夫多給以滋養物患者之體重。雖可增加。倘停止之。則復减少。或轉地於良氣候地。或使之入院。其體重雖增加。倘歸家時。亦復减少。此無他。蓋非因疾病之眞正治瘉。而體重增加者也。是以輕症患者以及潛伏結核患者。與其轉地療養。不如仍其日常之生活而注意於養生。其効力反多。吾人從體重以推測疾病恢復之程度。可作爲標準者。即發病前健康時之舊體重是也。若病已向治瘉之域。則其體重不可不恢復至舊體重。此乃當然之事也。所以在療養期中體重著明增加。遂以疾病爲已臻治瘉而樂觀者。非也。或熱已退。而他覺症狀亦良好僅體重之增加尙少。而悲觀者。亦非也。此等判斷。則有賴于專門知識之醫家。</p>

<h3>西瓜</h3>
<p>— 庸子</p>
<p>這幾天的西瓜’眞成子帝國主義者刀下的弱小民族。有　的大爺們　　’獨個兒吃一個’窮苦些兒的’零碎的貿着片兒吃。假使在這火熱的日子’而尙未嘗遇西瓜的’那簡直是二十世紀襄不安着侵略人家的歪念兒的帝國主義者’打着脚　蓋’也有些難找。</p>
<p>據說’只說吃西瓜’也有好幾種吃法。</p>
<p>一種是只咀瓜汁’不嚥瓜　’原因是瓜　這東西’很容易　積於腸胃’到了秋季裏’會議成腸胃病’而搗亂五　廟。若是只咀瓜汁’那麽淸凉却　’利便驅炎’使三彎九曲的大腸小腸’一律風調雨順’國泰民安這宛如帝國主義者’只求增進貿易關係’决無併吞土地的野心。這是最聰明的吃法。</p>
<p>一種是連汁帶　’一古腦兒狼吞虎咽下去的。不管將來怎麽樣’眼前有得吃’且吃一個痛快。這宛如帝國主義者’不只看相人家的錢’簡直連人家的土地及行政權’都要裝進自己口袋襄。這雖是不很漂亮’而且也是不很文明的吃法’但這倒是名副其實的吃西瓜。</p>
<p>考究吃西瓜的朋友’西瓜未成熟時’不愛吃’成熟遇度了’也是不歡迎的。他們的理由是未成熟時’太結實了’要咀出汁來’很是費力’而且汁水都帶着酸味’不很可口的。待到太熟了’表面的瓤’活像一塊塊的老棉絮’味甘可口的瓜汁’都乾涸了。所以善於吃西瓜的’專愛挑尙未成熟過度’而内部瓜瓤’將分裂而未分裂的西瓜吃’因爲這是汁最多而味最美的時候。</p>
<p>西瓜裡面’有西瓜子。西瓜子是可替西瓜傳宗接代的’但是人們太兇了’往往吃了西瓜’還要把西瓜子炒着。假使西瓜眞是象徵着一個國’而任人砍’分’咀’吞’臨了還要把西瓜子炒’那是何堪？</p>
<h3>都巿的夏</h3>
<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>滿街流着火’電木上漆的紅色招貼見了睜不開眼’電線一動不動’樹葉也死了的一樣；一切都浸在熱的鍋子裏’那西洋警犬的舌子’也拖在嘴外’紅紅地’在滴涎水。惟有高等華人和外國紳士駕駛的汽車’一溜烟’開足速率’打行人的頭上飛過’才空氣被振盪而揚起一點」王者之風「’挾了沙塵’沾上行人的汗臉’像髹了死灰那麽膩人！</p>
<p>然而咖啡座裏’飲冰的人們’在電扇下’把過分寒凉的液質’對着微笑的臉；用銀匙或純潔的麥管’舀着’吸着；向自己也祇嫌紅熱的柔腸裏灌。」眞熱呢！「大家這麽呌。可是那裏不見太陽被綠的龍鬚簾掩住了窗户。</p>
<p>都巿的另一横面：沿黄浦江岸’黄濁的水沉重地　着’火紅的’悶藍的’腫黑的向艦’疲倦地憇息着。然而那碼頭上’混雜的塵與烟煤裏’幢幢地來往着赤膊的勞働者們’從船肚子裏摟出了貨物’攆上肩’搬進巨大的堆棧’赤露的脚’踏在火熱的柏油路上’赤露的腿’晒在火熱的太陽光裏’赤露的背’　着火熱的貨色’他流汗’他喘氣’甚而至於中暑過甚而倒斃路旁’也不算一回事。他們大家也不過呌：」天熱呢「！</p>
<p>不錯’我們從輕快的春天’走進了夏之火獄了。我不知高橋海水浴塲裏的男女’也曾呌」天熱呢「沒有？或者農人會指與他的女兒說：」不要站在這裏’幹麽看那赤裸的······？去，拿鋤刈草去！「</p>
<p>不錯’夏給我們的是苛刻’但爲什麽我們不能在苛刻之下多做一點有益的工作呢？田間的草不刈盡’棉花會熟嗎？即使秋天到來’也許會有幸福的人再呌：」天冷了呢「！</p>
<h3>夏夜巡禮黄</h3>
<p>— 郭蘭馨</p>
<p>黄昏鐙影中’從新雅出來’踏上北四川路’送了小金張公吳小姐登汽車到愚園路聖愛娜去’我就踽踽的在街鐙人潮中巡禮歸來。</p>
<p>都巿的夏夜是含有許多誘惑與刺激的’的天的酷熱’這時已經開始歛跡了’凉快的風吹來’頭上面高聳入雲的大厦頂邊’掛着一個半圓的月’不瘦也不肥好像情人的嬌　’使人心神飄浮’也可以蕩滌胸中暑氣’白雲馳過’像一塊塊蟬翼的輕紗掩蔽。</p>
<p>北四川路的中國銀行虹口公寓的大建築’是受難後的新猷’滿目瘡痍的戰痕’漸漸地被新的建築物埋閉了。再也看不見萬千的血跡與嗁痕’世界就在這樣中過去。</p>
<p>經過外灘’黄浦江中點點舟鐙’像縱横錯落的星顆’也像許多妖媚的眼波’外灘公園裏擁滿了納凉的男女’有的在納凉的掩護下去追求調情’看吧’男女都是年輕’玫瑰色的紅暈中有的是靑春。</p>
<p>南京路向西’麗虹鐙的光彩眞動人’像女人日新月異的新妝’給予人愛好’給予人目眩’也給予人留情’到日昇樓’我厭這個地方太煩膩了’就怱怱走過’沒有留停’到跑馬廳畔靜安寺路上’在洋楓樹下面小立’紅錫包的鐘’大世界的門鐙’東方大中華飯店的房頂’慕爾堂的鐘樓’回顧三大公司的萬盞銀鐙’華安大厦’大光朋的新容’環有巨人般蹲着未來的東方最高建築’啊啊’這是繁華都巿的代表作啊！在這個銀鐙爟燦的四圍。</p>
<p>聽見了大滬跳舞廳華爾茲舞音樂從窗裏飛散出來後’我向西前去’成都路轉灣’天上的明月照我外’好像跳去了都巿’我愛這樣淸輕的風景’我愛這樣靜靜的夏之夜。</p>
<p>歸去’在小樓裏鐙畔’想靜靜地休息’忽地對過樓裏湖綠色的窗帘透出曼婉的歌聲’我聽出這是」今夜何之？「的曲調’我埋葬在這陶醉的歌聲中’月光緩緩地投進我懷中來’幽幽地’靜靜地’夜在漸漸地過去。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十二回寒賤苦從戎病夫落伍犧牲甘解甲戰士多情</p>
<p>原來這一番集中的軍號聲’是很平常的事’乃是晚間九點鐘點名以前應有的舉動。今天的値日官’另外有人’趙自强無須前去’自己怱怱忙忙的跑上樓來穿衣’那簡直是毫無意思的舉動。所以他自己一想’也不由得笑將起來。但是他的淸醒時間’究竟是爲時很暫的’過了十分鐘’他坐在床舖上’又沉沉的想起來了。他想着’無論如何’明天要抽着片刻的工夫’回海甸家裏去看看。這不爲着别的’媒人和兩方面’都說得一切妥當了’若是男家不向女家去有一點表示’這倒好像男家有些打退堂鼓。豈不是把事情無形擱下來了。那怕回去十分鐘呢’也應當回去一趟。可是這話又說回來了’這幾天’正是總司令要來檢閱的日子’設若自己回家去的時候’正是總司令來檢閱的時候’那就要闖下亂子’不知道要怎樣的收拾了。他坐着沉沉地向下只管想’忽然眼前一黑’原來是息了燈了。在息燈以後’除了就寢’也無事可作’他慢慢的趟下’又慢慢的想着’覺的楊家桂枝姑娘’旣不是那十分維新的人物’但是他的裝束’他的動作的也並非頑固到那樣極點’這正是自己平常想的那標準人物’不但是娶他來做媳婦’就是平常巿民公選’選個什麽區長里長’自己也一定投這種人的票。自己覺得是個半新不舊的人’也就只有這種半新不舊的人才和自己對勁。他這樣想着’便覺的是和父親商量’向楊家求婚的這件事’那是千萬躭誤不得。（一三七）</p>

<p>— 寗一</p>
<p>此次會考發生糾紛’就爲的是洩漏了英文題」十年後之中國「但是這題目却是怪有味的’十年後之中國’情形如何誰也不知！所以我也不妨借來胡猜一下。</p>
<p>十年後之中國也許是憲法盛行’而世界大同主義已佔有優勢’帝國主義已漸次消滅！但是有人說：也許長期抵抗不抵抗主義’十年後盛行一時？我國身爲發起人’以致土地日蹙？</p>
<p>十年之後’日本已在第二次大戰中消滅’所以我國不但收復了朝鮮’臺灣等失地；而且佔有日本’爲東亞一大國？　　十年後之中國’浴堂已入於淘汰之例’而按摩院却像老虎灶般的觸目皆是’各中學亦皆添有按摩專修科’凡畢業女生由校當局薦至各埠按摩院爲摩女！　　十年後之中國在敎育界佔有地位者’即今之參與學生運動者？</p>

<h3>靑島的海水浴場</h3>
<p>— 妙神</p>
<p>前年在靑島　暑’對於綠蔭遮道’碧翠欲滴的靑島’至今有無限的依戀；尤其是一個海水浴塲’在暑氣薰蒸的今天’令人更加想慕。上海雖有游泳池’規模較大的如虹口游泳池’但那裏及得到靑島海水浴塲的萬一呢？</p>
<p>靑島海水浴塲在南海沿’這地方是天然一個海水浴塲的沙灘。這沙灘很淺’三面環的都是小山沙灘的别面’築有無數的更衣小屋’這些有的是私人的’有的是公家的’公家的可以出租’租費以一個夏季計算。</p>
<p>大概在下午二三點的時候’游泳的人’都帶游泳衣或橡皮圈’陸續地來了。這些游泳的羣衆’西洋人和日本人倒極多’並且大都是天天來的長主客’中國人呢’很多是來趕趕閙熱的　　當我們換了游泳衣’赤了脚走出小房子的時候’便踏着軟綿綿的沙灘’這沙又細又凉’在脚底下磨擦’有異樣的快感。我們望着在海水中飘蕩着的紅紅綠綠美　的男女’我們火樣熱的艶羡’不自覺使我們兩腿的推動’突然的加速’急急地奔向海水裏跑恰恰一個浪來’把游泳衣打濕了半件’覺得腿上眞舒適呀’冰凉的。我們漸漸走過去’海水已齊了乳部了’只見一個戴了綠色橡皮帽’穿了大紅色條子的羊毛衫的女子’正向前划着她的雪白的兩臂和兩腿’游到我們這裏來’伊游的姿勢和速率’都很高妙’這時我們同去的徐君說；恐怕是日本人吧？說着他縱身向水裏一攢’便去追逐那女子’那女子見有人追逐’更向前衝’只見兩道水面上白色的水沫’在他們腿後搖洩着’在太陽下閃爍着金光。</p>

<h3>第三種人的「推」</h3>
<p>— 達伍</p>
<p>最近有事到漢口去了一次。動身的前一天’看見報上登有一條」小新聞「’說蕪湖有一個山西寡婦’帶着孤兒’來滬謀生不遂’只好空無所得’重返故里；因爲沒有錢買票’給建國輪船上的茶房推落浦中’淹死了。孤兒就抛在岸上。在這大家忙着攘内安外的年頭’這類事自然是沒有人注意的。</p>
<p>但我却因此想起不久之前’有一個賣報的孩子給人推下電車碾死’和某家戲塲失事’十幾個人被推死踏死的事。</p>
<p>這被推死踏死的’大抵是婦人和小孩’而且是」下等的「。</p>
<p>我又想起某先生爲這件事作過一篇文章’题目呌」推「。大意說’我們時常可以遇到兩種以推爲業的人物’一種是洋大人’另一種是同胞’然而」上等「的。但據我這次旅行親自得到的經騐’除上面所說的兩種推以外’還有第三種人物的」推「。這種人’旣非」上等「’亦不便列作下等。然而他要」帮閑「」上等「的來推」下等「的。山西寡婦’就是給這種帮閑的人物推下水去的。</p>
<p>這種」帮閑「的人物’陸上也有’船上也有’是屬於」兩棲「一類。在馬路上的小販和小手藝者’常要被搶去」傢生「’摔上一丈多遠’自己是被推仆地’甚至送了性命’這就是第三種」推「法。是帮閑」上等「來推的。大抵是頭戴銅盆帽’手執器喪棒之類的人物’這是在陸上。</p>
<p>上船’進艙’下船’你也要被推。這也是第三種」推「法。但只限於坐統艙或買半票’或買不起票的。買了統艙票的要被房艙裏的人推’單單買了船票’而不買床位的要被無論那一艙的人推’推得你無容身之地。至於連船票也買不起的人’就直率了當’推上岸或推下水去。萬一船開了’　被發現’就先在你身上窮搜一遍’在衣角上或褲腰裏出一毛兩毛’或十幾枚銅元’盡數取去’充作船費’然後把你推下船底的貨艙了事。而這以後’不論遠近’不管久暫’船上是不供給伙食’要把你餓得半死不活的。這些事’都由船上的」帮閑「者們來幹’使用的是」第三種推「法。</p>
<p>我這次親眼看見從南京上來兩個苦學生’買了船票’但買不起床位’給他們且喝且推’推得無處容身’問站在旁邊」閒看「的我道：」我們出錢買票’却不許我們立足’難道錢是呌我們白出的嗎？」我告訴他們：」你們出了錢’他們自然要把你從南京」推「到上海去的啊！</p>
<h3>讀小刊物捷徑</h3>
<p>— 另境</p>
<p>目下正是小刋物的全盛時代。據我看’這些小刋物是從前的」短兵「」寸鐵「」照妖鏡「之類的體式發展而來的。但讀這些小刋物却不是椿容易的事。其一自然是因爲政治派别的繁複：其次乃是因爲文人頭腦的進步。</p>
<p>要達到政治的效果’暗示反比明說效用大’這好像倒是從文藝作法上竊取來的’可惜無法證明這些執筆者是否都是文學之士。自然’還是因爲中國新文學運動的時日太短所以到今日纔產生這比較成熟的技巧。從前的小刋物手上’所用的技巧决沒有如現在的巧妙’在批評或謾駡别人的不好不對而後’接着就會告訴讀者：」咱們是對的！「」咱們萬歲！「這是所謂注入式的敎學法’顯然是很笨的方法。但這方法也并非决無價値’只是對於一般需要藏頭躱尾收宣傳於潛移默化之中的刋物’實不適用。</p>
<p>簡言之’現在這些小刋物的筆法也并無難學’他們只統一在一個單純的公式之下’那就是：</p>
<p>謾駡十　駡十　駡十·········這之後’决不提出」擁護「或那種露骨的」萬歲主義「來’就此而止’使讀者感覺得餘味無窮。</p>
<p>巧妙就在這裏。他們自然不是」駡倒主義者「’你也不好他也不好之後定必有個好的在裏邊’這好的并不公然提出來’不是别人’就是自己的主人’就是要向他伸手的這一方面。</p>
<p>使讀者廓淸了各方面的雜念’自然會相信他這一方面了’這就是他的政治效果。</p>
<p>不過讀者倘要想還它一個的的確確的」娘家「’還須先對於目下的種種政治派别有一個綱領的認識。</p>
<h3>夜</h3>
<p>— 侍桁</p>
<p>在夜的黑暗裏’魔鬼張開了兇惡的眼。夜的城巿’輝耀着凄慘的光’像一個吐着萬丈的火熖的巨大的怪獸。</p>
<p>在發着各式各樣的光的城巿的街道上’流動着成千成萬的肉屍’像是一些鬼影。</p>
<p>整個的城巿變成了一個肉慾縱横的世界：伴着管絃樂的狂舞’擁抱着女屍的醉酒’使心臟激動的賭博’一切疲倦之極的慾的昂奮。</p>
<p>但夜的黑暗是短促的’天空露出魚白</p>
<p>色，曙光將顯到世上，是魔鬼該歛跡的時候了。</p>
<p>從紅綠燈下的舞塲裏’兩個男女靑年踉蹌着走出來’他們還許是那未來之希望的年輕的學生。</p>
<p>女的’在蓬鬆的捲髮下有一個圓圓的貓的面孔’肉是死的’凝固的’塗着白粉’頰上堆着兩塊胭脂’參雜着汗流和斑痕。長旗袍’高跟皮鞋’長統絲襪’走起路來最惹人注目的是那隱在衣服裏的兩個特别發達的臀部和乳房’這是她的誇耀’她的財產。</p>
<p>男的’像是害了貧血病似地面黄肌瘠’眼裏沒有光’遮着一層疲倦的雲霧’不過頭髮是光光的’塗着」斯坦康「。他也是最時髦的裝束’西裝。漆皮鞋’肥大的褲脚’但隱藏不住的是他的胸部的一條一條的肋骨’和那細如木柴的兩條腿。他也有他的資本’那便是金錢。汽車飛馳在長長的馬路上’載着這兩架屍。那個貓臉的頭枕在男人的瘦瘠的肩上’發着嬌滴滴的聲音說：</p>
<p>」你送我回學校吧「</p>
<p>男的不作聲’轉過臉來對她一笑’眼裏傅出一道柔媚的電’先是乞求’其次是命令’女的歡喜了’伸出右臂抱住他的頸部’面孔貼得更緊　些　　　　　五層的高大的樓房　　間旅客的　　。穿着整齊制服的僕歐’引着他們開了一間房’裏邊是西門子的床’沙發’梳妝檯’穿衣鏡’洗澡間。倒在沙發上’男子的骨肉已經有點酥麻’臉上發燒’女的裝作像是懼怕的樣子’但她的心的確是平靜的。</p>
<p>燈熄滅了’人愈加變成了獸’獸在狂歡着’由靑春的精力致成死亡的疲倦。一切都在安息了’再聽不到急促的喘息和剌鼻的汗臭。</p>
<p>人變成了獸’獸變成了死屍！</p>
<p>曙光探出頭來’太陽緩緩地從東方昇起’又開始了一個白晝’白晝不是他們的所有’那正是他們甜睡的時候。</p>
<p>夜是他的世界’夜是獸慾的世界’夜是魔鬼的世界。</p>
<h3>關於中國文學</h3>
<p>— 余慕陶</p>
<p>趙老爺：你轉變了方向’你轉變而簡直承認你以前對我的造謠｝｝祇是剪’祇是抄的造謠，現在你說我」寫了有「。不過’你說我寫得錯誤。現在’我爲了節省篇幅’祇簡單答你幾條。　　㈠兩漢之所以產生辭賦’請讀拙編三三面至三七面’一三八面第十行’原是行文反應法。</p>
<p>㈡魏晋六朝作家之所以消極’你說我抄你的’你實在有意僭越’茲列對照如下：</p>
<p>趙：」晋代人好淸談’學老莊’文人自然亦非例外。所以晋代文人除去英雄般的劉琨以外·差不多沒有一個不是消極態度處世的「。（小史二五）</p>
<p>余：」晋承漢魏之作’其起始的政權形式’自然要遷就農民’或者當時的農民戰爭竞葬送了一大批的農民數量。不然那由漢獻帝時己經騷動起來而經過魏朝的黄巾是平定不下來的···晋朝始終沒有把農民問題解决。牠的政權由魏朝攘奪過來以後’便建立在大封宗室的苟安當中。晋朝到　　　　　　　　　　　一般　民早已無法了’何兄惠帝又愚　　異常。這時無衣無食的大　　人民｝｝農民　自然又如以前各朝的一樣暴動起來了。同時’北方的野　人又趁中原有　顧之憂’卽晋室八王之亂’都梢率　兵南下。這眞像五世紀時的羅馬。因爲社會是這樣動亂不安’故朝野多習於消極···「（</p>
<p>拙編四七’四八’四九面）。</p>
<p>你老爺的書’就翻爛了也翻不出我這種」淺陋「。</p>
<p>㈢元　不是因爲商業資本特别發達’這　’你老爺可參考希臘悲劇之所以發達的原因’拙編一七至一八面。所引藏晋叔之言’紙用來證明東西戲劇的發達途程一樣而己。</p>
<p>㈣明淸章回小說之所以出現的原因’你說我」引用「淸人和近人的筆記’算不得你的」創見「’這足見你二十一日對我所寫的」紙糊術「和」文剪公「都是誣衊’你說我不看書’祇是剪’祇是糊’然而你現在又說我」引用「’這才是蠢（著）書匠一再露了馬脚。至於」創見「’我早就不敢想’因爲天下的事體都是主客觀相對地存在。</p>
<p>㈤你說」宋朝有雜劇和傳奇’可謂文學史上的大發現！元朝也有傳奇’也是同樣的滑稽「！老爺’你得多讀一些書’少　些瞎話。宋朝有雜劇’祇要你查一下鄭編」文學大綱「三○三面’第八和第九行：</p>
<p>」宋史樂志言：「眞宗不喜鄭聲而或爲雜劇詞’未嘗宣佈於外」。蘇軾詩有：「搬演故人事’出人鬼門道「。</p>
<p>宋朝有傳奇’請看一下魯著」中國小說史略「一二七面第一行以下：</p>
<p>」傳奇之文亦有作者：今訛爲唐人作綠珠傳「一卷’」楊太眞外傳「一卷’卽宋樂史之撰也···一</p>
<p>元朝也有傳奇’」傳奇「二字原沿用舊名’其實’卽魯本所謂」擬話本「之意如：」大宋宣和遺事「。關於」擬話本「的解釋’可參考鄭編四一六面。</p>

<h3>平凡的事（二一）</h3>
<p>— 澹果孫</p>
<p>邱代表說了一聲：」唉！「就也低頭不語’和之光繼續向西北而行；他們只求早藏目的地横着心把耳邊的一切聲浪丢開’所以事實上’就是快走’就是快走。在他們望見陳家浜附近那幾個大竹圍的時候’閘北前線的」交無曲「’忽然一步一步活動起來。這絶不是零零落落的幾　步槍和幾響手榴彈了’她們是一步比一步來得密的’是雜在閣閣閣閣的機關槍和綳巴綳巴的迫　砲之中來的；問或選聽見轟隆隆的來得很近的野砲。只要那末轟隆隆一聲’之光就感到地面要波動一次。</p>
<p>他們忍不住都抬著苦笑的臉向東瞧一瞧’然而他們的腿却仍然偏着向陳家浜前進······前進······前進······終於走不上一二十分鐘’他們都到了理家浜那個村子裏了：村外的竹園裏’伏着七八個小孩’他們正都抬頭閑望那幾架己經轉向由南而北的飛機。說到陳家浜是個村子’或許爲的是口頭上的便利罷。因爲以形勢而論’不遇是二十來栜破</p>
<p>而又矮的房子’很不整齊地列在一條略有竹樹的小溪丨小浜丨邊’倘若照北方的術語說來’簡直是一所」大院「的一半丨彷彿可以說當時只蓋了臨浜的那一排。這樣’小浜和房子之間的那一條空地’就不期然而然地形成一個畸形的院落了。這院落裏的一切’除了那些半黄不綠的竹子以外’無論是牆壁’泥土’樹木’留在　下的零星器具’晾在樹下的長短衣裳’以及那些放在地上可供種種用處的石頭’幾乎無一處不是灰黑色的’充分地把衰落的氣象</p>
<p>煊染出來。</p>
<p>之光和邱代表的步聲’打破了那院落喪的寂靜’登時就有兩三條睡在門邊的狗’抬起頭來顯出江南動物的通性應景地呌了幾聲。兩個兵士從一個人家的大門裏出來了’他們在打過照面之後’一齊向門衷走。</p>

<h3>棉花分級與產銷合作　狄福豫</h3>
<p>㈠　例言</p>
<p>復興農村’改良生產’爲吾國目下先務之急。救濟之道千頭萬緒’而以提倡棉業產銷合作爲最便利。而且切要。蓋棉花占世界物產品中之首要地位’人生日用一日不可或缺。但因其品種氣候土質’及調製方法之不同’其品質因而差異。故歐美等國’對於棉花’早有品級標準之處理’以整頓棉產’發展棉業’如埃及棉·美國陸地棉·及海島棉等’其品質之優良’久爲世人所稔知。吾國棉業旣復幼稚’商業上又無品級標凖之推行’致棉花交易’漫無秩序’一任軋户棉商之輾轉販買’嘗發生壟斷壓迫操縱作弊等事’以一己之利益爲依歸’其貽誤於棉產者非淺。循至良棉每無相當之代價’因之埋沒；而劣棉則觸目皆是。不得己輸入外棉’以爲接濟。甚至專紡細紗之廠’已完全採用外棉’國棉則不屑一顧。前途實已岌岌不可終日。爲棉產改進計’產銷雙方應有切實之合作’而棉花分級’實爲合作中之先决問題。紡織業應有深切之覺悟’遠大之目光’以扶助棉花分級之推行。目下應稍具犧牲之决心’對於優良棉花之提價’應較普通爲高’究其實際’則棉花一經分級’在紡織上之功用甚大。因其品質純正’棉絲整齊’欲紡何種之紗’適宜於用何級之貨’調配便利’而少無謂之消耗。在生產方面’因良棉有品級標準爲之保障’可得提價之利益’棉農自然樂種良棉’增加生產。故棉花分級’又足以救濟農村’提高物價’實產銷雙方一舉兩得之舉也。</p>
<p>㈡　我國棉花品級標準之概述</p>
<p>吾國素無棉花品級標準之規定’一般棉商’尙不知品級爲何物。查華商紗布交易所亦有其棉花等級表’惜其辦法尙屬簡單’祗以各地之地名爲標準’僅便於在交易所買進賣出交割期貨之用’或未必盡然。與美國所訂期現買　之棉花品級標準’所謂分門别類’獎優貶劣者’相去遠甚。上海商品檢騐局有鑒於斯’故對於棉花分級派員負責從事研究有年’採用美國農部製造棉花品級標準方法’曾向美國農部購得各種品級標準’以供參考。蓋以美國爲世界上棉花最大巿塲’其品級爲世界所通行。且我國繁殖美棉’年年增加’故我國棉花分級’更宜依照美國分級之辦法。研究方法’係採集各地棉樣’作鑒定品級之試騐’結果將全國棉產’通盤籌劃’試訂標準’同在一種學理之下’而有類别級别之分’以謀改去商業上各種不同之觀察’免除各方執一之見’且有實際之標本’裝入品級盒’以資對照。類别標準者’係因吾國棉種不一’品質逈異’不能同列在一種品級標準之下’故大别之’分有五種類别。</p>
<p>㈠長絨美種棉品級標準’㈡短絨美種棉品級標準’㈢黑籽中棉品級標準’㈣白籽中棉品級標準’㈤特别硬絨品級標準’</p>
<p>至於級别’則無論爲何類標準’均取同一之觀察。概别爲五級’卽第一級　優級’第二級爲上級’第三級爲中級’第四級爲下級’第五級爲劣級是也。如在分級時發生困難’則以半級附之。其分級之條件’須在特殊光線之下’視其色澤之上下’夾雜物之多少’及軋工之良劣’而定其等級。優級之棉’大概須色澤精亮有絲光’棉絲整齊淸净’軋棉良好’稍見籽屑。上級之程度較優級爲次’而在中級之上。中級棉花’則棉中頗有受氣候影響之污點’如黄染灰染淡染等之附粘稍多’但並不趨於灰暗’軋棉平常’絲團稍有葉片籽屑層壳頗多。下級之棉’色澤呆白’略帶灰暗’各種染污’頗爲顯著’使棉樣呈不潔之形狀’葉片籽屑層壳棉子更多’軋斷棉絲及絲團’均有發現。劣級之程度’則更較下級爲次。此外棉絲之長度’亦有一定之規定’而棉絲整齊與否及其强弱’亦包括在内。最近該局又有棉花品級標準價格提减之試訂’使我國各地所產之棉’依照品級而論價’均得有相當之價値’如同爲美種’而　寶棉天津棉山東棉等’其品級程度及長度本高’當得提價之利益’如漢口棉沙巿棉等’其品級及長度均低’則須受相當之减價。但所謂　　棉其品級未必盡優’漢口棉未必悉劣。總之各地棉花之程度並不相同。長度亦有差異’須依照品級而加减’方得實花之價値’以糾正祗知以地各爲標準之錯誤。而斯所得之利益’不可限量’茲略舉如下：　　㈠利便棉品買賣手績’㈡處理棉貨紛擾交涉’㈢增商棉花品質’㈣促進棉農　棉與趣’㈤防止奸商劣農舞弊’㈥可助棉區推廣’㈦促</p>
<p>發紗貨上之進步’㈧减少紡織業之虧損’</p>
<p>三　推行棉花分級之計劃</p>
<p>我國棉花品級’事屬創　。上海商品檢騐局雖已試訂就緒顧欲將此種品級推行全國’則非棉業　對於　在　級　　　　　　　不　　政府　過　　　　導　　　行推　　乃　須　業本　之努力’　爲出　　　合作上　　應有棉花分級之計　。計　雜何’卽在棉花原產地舉行分級事業是也。蓋以現在巿場上之棉花’单爲棉商優劣雜柔’打成整包’苟欲於扞樣時’逐包拆騐’爲事實所不許。則消貴者欲得良棉’惟有與生產者合作’就原產地舉行棉花分級是也。然以民智未開’欲紡織廠派員赴產棉區’收買棉花’舉行分級’事煩而費鉅。祗有用有經騐之分級員’處理其事。目前雖少此種人才’不妨先行相當訓練。一面再與辦有成效之合作農塲合作。消　方面’亦須設立合作社’由產銷雙方切實合作’方可收指臂之效。茲擬具計劃如下。</p>
<p>㈠地點擇主要棉產地及品種純粹之區’指定數處’先行舉辦。如湖南西部’浙江餘姚’河南　　’陜西西安等處’均頗適宜。各地如有合作農塲’則辦理較易。㈡訓練分級員招請農學專門學校畢業生或高中畢業生六人至八人’派至上海商品檢騐局’受相當之訓練’至少三月。訓練期滿’擔任棉花原產地分級工作。㈢事業　（一）與銷費者合作。棉花分級’爲改進棉產之要舉’在我國爲創辦。故舉行棉花分級之前應先期與各紡織廠商訂合同’指定一基本等級。如照基本等級高一級或一級之上者’應增價若干。照基本等級低一級或一級之下者’應减價若干。棉絲之長短’其價亦應增有减。增减之差數’可依照美國棉花標準各級增减之價値而比例之’或公議一種辦法。棉花水分之高低’雖不在品級標準條件之内’但產銷兩方’亦另應訂定。如以百分之十二爲標準’（豫陜等省可以百分之九爲標準）則凡超過十二斤者’應在棉價中照量扣除’不滿十二斤者’亦應於棉價中加出’以昭平允。并使慣於攙水者’無從施其技倆’則攙水之弊病可除。棉絲整齊率須定百分之八十八以上者爲合格’不滿百分之八十八者亦應削减其價値’而棉絲之强度亦包括在内。（二）與生癧者合作我國棉農或商販等’對於棉花品級’尙都不知爲何物。故辦理棉花分級者’應如何提倡及宣傳並指導其對於棉品若何提倡’若何揀選’品質務求整齊’　别極應正確’獎優貶劣’使棉花之良劣’各得有相當之價値。惟此項工作極爲困難’如各地有合作農塲’或地方當局合作’較易進行。（三）仿製棉花品級標準棉花分級’貴於有實際之標本’以資比較。故須採集各地棉樣’分别等級’依照上海商品檢騐局試訂之吾國棉花品級標準’從事仿製若干副’在產銷兩方’各置有標本一副或數副’以備棉花分級時對照之用。（四）分級手續分級員在棉花原產地舉行分級’應於打包（指機包）之前行之。憑習綀品級之經騐’並按照棉花品級鑑定方法’在特殊光線之下’視察其色澤’軋工之上下’夾雜物之多少’以鑑定其品級。並須騐其品種長度等’遂批分别調製’方可打包。在打包時’每包須備同樣小包’與大包具同一之號碼’以備扞樣’復騐時免拆大包之麻煩。惟分級員或合作農塲’對於此種小包’須負絶對責任。每一棉包上’應註明類别·級别·長度·分級員姓名等項’並須將每日分級情形’記載表册’以便報告。已經分級之棉樣’應保留若干’爲製造標本之用。（五）組織審查委員會棉花分級’在原產地舉行之後’卽依照合同’將棉花裝至預定之廠方。廠方可聲請當地檢騐局復騐。卽以檢騐局所出之證書爲憑。倘產銷雙方尙有異議時’可組織審查委員會’其人數最少以五人組織之’局方三人’產銷兩方各一人’經三人以上之同意’卽可取决之。總之各地所產之棉’其品級程度雖不同’分級之學理則一。置全國棉產同在一種學理之下’以免各方膠執。成見’其有利於行銷爲何如。（六）宣傳與推廣。宣傳方法’須預印說明書若干種’分發棉農商販’詳述分級之利益’作弊之爲害’俟分級事業辦有成效’然後推廣於各地。</p>
<p>㈣　結語</p>
<p>歐美各國棉農棉商紡織商及進出口大小商人’對於棉花品級標準’幾於家喻户膮’而以美國更爲詳盡。棉花巿場’均有領照分級員鑑别等級。因此產量豐富’品質優良’其銷路之暢旺’遂亦如水銀淌地’無孔不入。回顧我國棉業’暮氣沉沉’絶少振刷之新精神。棉農棉商紡織廠’均各以一己之利益爲重。不能互相連絡。故棉農因良棉無較高之代價’毫無改良棉種及别選棉花之興趣’棉商欺壓棉農’鴻盡操縱之能事’奸詐者更不顧一切’擔雜作　’以遂其私’而貽紡織廠以各種之損失。紡織廠亦大都祇顧私利’惠有　而善不　’對於良棉’不肯出較高之價’　棉價下跌時’更多方桃别’　　殺　。騐貨　　别不當　或　受則路’更　棉　　啇之幾。故改良棉產’卒以商業上　　　　。　　　　之　　。於以見提　棉花分數’實行棉業　　　　’爲不可須　或　之舉。旣足以救濟農村’提高棉品價値’且可促　棉田之推廣。準其　　　加’　棉產　乏之恐　’將不解决而　　决矣。</p>
<h3>土布業之衰落及其救濟　　王辛</h3>
<p>一·土布業與喜國農民經濟</p>
<p>土布之爲農定副業’夫人而知之。農民以耕織爲要務；耕者’卽正業之農作也’織者’卽副業之土布也。農家日出而作’日入而息’其能仰事俯書者。惟耕織是賴’故土布與農民經濟’有密切之關係在焉。近年以來’農村經濟’一厥不振’　厥原因’固非一端’而耕織之衰敗’自爲其主要關鍵。至耕織之所以衰敗’厥因尤夥’要亦不外天災人禍’經濟侵略有以致之。耕織之衰敗旣若是’長此以往’農村經濟之不瀕於總破產者幾希矣。</p>
<p>二·土布業之產銷及其商帮</p>
<p>按吾國土布之產銷地’範圍至廣’徧及國内外。以言產地’在江蘇則有武進·常熟·江陰·</p>
<p>崇明·啟東·通州·上海·川沙·南　·嘉定·等地；在浙江則有平湖·海寗（硤石在内）王店·新簧·新埭·等。以言銷售地域’則有廣東·廣西·南洋　島’新加坡；噴叻·　羅·小呂宋·瓜哇及福建安徽山東東三省等地。</p>
<p>土布產於通崇海一帶者’日沙布。產於上海浦東者’日套布。產於滬巿西鄉者’日淸水布。各地出產之土布名稱雖互異’然太别之’不外靑藍布與白布二種。至經營土布業之商帮’計分滬·常熟崇明·通州四帮’以滬帮勢力爲最大’專營靑藍布’崇明常熟兩帮專營白布。以上海一埠而論’經營土布業之商店’全滬總計二十餘家’資本最大者爲一萬元’佔全數十分之二’最小者二千元’亦佔十分之二’普通約在六千元左右’佔十分之六。全年營業額最大者’爲五十萬元’普通三十萬元’最小三萬元。</p>
<p>三·土布業之衰落及其原因</p>
<p>土布業之衰落’至今日而極’以數量言’滬地套布與淸水布’每年　銷售額’在民國十年前’達三十萬包。近三五年來’己减至一萬包。通崇海及各地土布’在民國十五年前’年銷二十餘萬包’近四五年來’己减至十一二萬包’衰落之程度’不難想見。以價格言’則十六疋瀏陽夏布’去年價格爲五十兩’本年價格爲四十九元’百疋毛　土布’去年價一百九十二兩’今年價二百六十元’通州大尺布’去年價三十五兩六錢’今年價四十六元五角’中尺布去年價九十六兩’今年價一百十九元’銀灰去年價一百四十兩’今年價二百元’京　去年價一百五十六兩’今年價二百○三元。總計銷售額’减十分之九’售價　十分之一。</p>
<p>然則土布業　落之康因何在？試略述之：一日土布製造之粗劣也’土布業量守舊法’不求進步’售價旣貴’品貿又劣’於此欲與洋布角逐商塲’不亦　乎。二日洋布之　人也’洋布之輪入’實爲土布業之致命傷’國人以洋布價廉而物美’故樂於購用’洋布銷路愈廣’卽土布寢落愈甚’三日東三省之陷落也’土布原以東三省爲大銷塲’自東省失陷後’大好巿塲’盡爲日本濠布席捲而去’其影帶於土布銷路者至鉅。四日農民　　力之减退也’近年農村經濟’每况愈一’農民　　力’日　减退’土布業旣失其大好之　主’於是呈衰　之象。五日海外貿易之不振也’近年海外貿易’頗爲不振’如南洋橡皮業’卽其一例’是彤　於土布之海外營業者’亦匪淺鮮焉。</p>
<p>四·土布業之救濟方案</p>
<p>土布業之衰落若是’而其與農民經濟之關係若彼’則吾人當謀所以救濟之道’試一述之。一日增加土布之長闊也’土布之最大缺點’要爲其尺幅太狹。吾國河北之高陽縣’首以私人之力’勸誘農家’改照廠布製法’至今每年產額’達千數百萬元之多’北方數省’殆無不知有高陽布之名者。近者’南通農民敎育館’改良當地土布’己見成效’寛度增至二尺二寸’長度增至七丈二尺’每疋獲利甚多。足徵增加土布之長闊’誠屬當務之急也。二日提染土布之花色也’土布長闊’旣經增加’又須提花染色’以求美觀。南通土布’除增加長寛外’又經提染花色’故與廠布無殊。三日提倡土布之機織也’機織利益甚多’擇其　　大者而言’有如增加生產减輕成本改進品質等項。日本　布之價廉物美’亦不外由其機織所致。故欲澈底改良吾國之土布’必須提倡機織。四日减低土布之售價也’土布旣經改良’售價力求低廉。近今商業上有一新趨勢’卽所謂」　利多賣「主義’不求價貴而賣少’但求利薄而多售。良</p>
<p>以售價貴’而銷售减’而羸利少；反之’售價低’而銷售增’而羸利厚’是爲吾人所不可不知者也。以上數端’祇就土布本身方面而言’果能循此力行’雖不敢云有若何之成效’但至少足以挽救土布業襄落之程度’是可斷言者。不侫以土布之衰落’有關吾國國民經濟之榮枯者至巨’用敢貢其一得之　’以備社會熱心人士之商榷。</p>
<h3>棉業重興之樞紐邱光庭</h3>
<p>讀海關報告册而愀然日’二十餘年來棉貨輸人’有昔少而今多者’有今少而昔多者。昔少今多’是國内生產低落’不足應消費之需’而取給於國外也。昔多今少’是國内生產漸增’能以所產應所需’漸無待於外求也。再輸入物之今少於昔’其屬於工者’卽工業漸興之證’今多於昔’其屬於幾者’卽農業衰落之象。棉布輸入’至民八而漸增’其先尙有手織土布應銷’至是乃漸趨淘汰。近三年中’棉布輸入之量’復由極峯而漸下游’一則爲農村購胃力弱’一以國内織機漸增’生產旣增’輸入自减。至棉紗一項’民十後漸形减少’至今僅及民十以前八分之一’乃國内華洋紗廠紡錠漸增之明效也。其最足驚心’而使農村經濟蒙受最嚴重影響者’則爲棉花之輸入。由民八以前之二十餘萬担’進爲二十年之四百六十餘萬担’價逹關元一萬七千九百餘萬兩。最近三年平均’每年有原棉三百五十餘萬担輸入’而有關銀一萬四千餘萬兩之外溢。語其故’曰量不足也’質不合於現代紡織工程之需也。蓋人類文化日進’織物之需要’亦由粗而進於細。中棉織維粗短’不能爲精細紗布之製成’故其用量日就减少。人類嗜慾’不能由文而重返於質’卽不能屏細布於不衣’而强粗布於必用。則欲杜外棉輸入’惟有謀原棉品質之改進’及量之增加也。所可惜者國家多故’爲政者不能致力於修明内政’獎進生產。今幸行政院而有復興農村委員會之設’而美棉麥借欵’亦有移撥一部爲改良晨產之用’棉亦自在其中矣。</p>
<p>中華棉產改進會’爲吾國改進棉產之唯一集團’會員皆　於棉作學識’且各具改進棉產之弘願’今於二届年會之後’定能將决議之案’一一付諸實現’則織維細長　白之原棉’可不仰結於人’農村亦有復興　之望矣。</p>
<h3>北平社會經濟的一瞥　（續）　　程文藹</h3>
<p>三　商業的情形</p>
<p>北平因非通商口岸’所以其全巿的商業’普不十分　盛。不過有兩種營業比較特别發達’第一件是關於」吃「的方面’大概是平地的居民都講究吃的’所以飯館業特别發達：第二件是關於」玩「的方面大概是平地的居民都嗜京調的’所以戲園亦特别發達。此外皮貨在平地的商業中’可說是佔着重要地位。至於商品巿塲方　’　　日貨在百分之八十以上’而眞正國貨反察　不可多兄’此是無可　言的　不觀報載日貨　銷於我國巿塲’而尤以華北爲最　至　　業的　　　　　　西河沿可　是金　　的中心點’因爲各銀行均來集於此。太棚欄可說是　　　　　　　　　　　　　說　　　　　　的中心點。琉璃廠可說是書舖業的中心點。王府井大街可說是新式百貨業的中心點’因爲中原公司開設後’引起不少平地摩登男女的注意。其左近又爲東安巿塲’是平地唯一的百貨商塲’大都趨重於」吃「」着「兩方面。此外尙　西　盛。天橋巿塲’又說是平地唯一的民衆的娛樂消遣的地方’但是除却了一般失業的工人’退伍的士兵’勞苦　衆及小商人等；摩登男女是絶少往游的上此外平地尙有許多小販趕節集巿的’有如隆福寺的逢九’十·十一·十一；護國寺的逢七·八·九·十；白塔寺的逢五·六：土地廟的逢三；花白巿的逢四；東　廟的逢一·十五；以上均按陽曆計算。雖然’平地一般商業有一種特點’就是缺少投機買賣的事　’不過墨守陳規’是其缺點。</p>

<p>北平金融界亦分新舊兩派’新派就是銀行業’舊派就时銀錢業’各有各的公會。不過北平的銀錢業。汪若上海的銀錢業’在金融界中佔有絶大的勢力；北平的金融界完全爲銀行業所操縱。按北平銀行公會成立於民國九年’其會員最多涬三十餘家’現祇餘十一家。分三等：　　中國銀行　　　　　　　　北洋保商銀行　　交通銀行　　　　　　　　大陸銀行　　監業銀行　　　　　　　　中孚銀行　　新華信託儲蓄銀行　　　　浙江興業銀行　　金城銀行　　　　　　　　中國農工銀行　　中國實業銀行</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>論長衫同志</h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>長衫而稱同志’不知出於何典。然而這决不可比擬於中山裝同志’其理至明’因中山裝多半爲忠實同志所穿’而長衫者却沒有如此界限。雖然他們也被列於同志之間’但不一定都可加上忠實字樣。假使每個長衫都忠而且實’那末</p>
<p>當今天下’便不能如此太平矣。</p>
<p>或人問：何謂長衫同志？曰：同志者’如今世界最文明之尊稱也。而長衫者’乃穿長衫之人也。茲就此等人而論之’故曰論長衫同志。</p>
<p>長衫同志旣不穿馬掛亦不穿中山裝。雖然有時爲了别人的雙喜或是拜壽’也不免要穿起馬掛來’以使作揖時顯出斯文模樣’雖然有時爲了到中山陵去拜謁總理’不免要穿起中山裝　’以便顯出曾經革過命來的神氣’但是究竟不過是一時興緻而巳’一年三百六十日’到底是穿長衫的日子爲多。</p>
<p>此等人’就社會地位而言’上不易高攀政客官僚’下比煤烟薰黑了鼻孔的勞働者則足足有餘。就經濟的比率而言’上不能和有錢人資本家比擬’下較　三乞丐却又足足有餘。就文化程度而言’上不如博士碩士的學問淵博’下比讀江湖奇俠傅或是看連環圖畫的朋友却也足足有餘。有人給他們定了一個中間階層的地位’也有人稱他們爲小布爾喬亞。</p>
<p>他們要吃肉’但有時也袛得吃靑菜豆腐。他們要看戲’但祇能坐在前廳。他們得坐三等電車’但不肯坐拖車。他們也歡喜嫖女人’但又沒方法討姨太太。他們要房租便宜’但又不肯住平房。他們要賭博’但又不敢打洋鈿么半。他們相發財’但又不能一個人買一聯航空建設獎劵。他們要做官’但又拿不出本錢。他們失業了’整天以大餅充飢’但又不肯做强盜綁票。他們失戀了’也想忿氣在别的女人身上撒次爛污’但又受不住良心的譴責。他們講理智’但又受不了强烈的感情之刺激。他們受傷感’但有時也要勸人頭腦冷靜。總之’他們的一切都是矛盾。</p>
<p>更有進者；當外來侵略打得中國落花流水的時候’他們主張全國皆兵’北上收復失地·但是也相信長期抵抗或是建設救國也是救國之道。他們主張愛國’但也不擁護五色國旗。他們要反帝·但亦相信遠交近攻。他們勸人加入義勇軍’實行鐵血救國’但是總不願自己也調上前綫。他們相信國貨救國·但爲了仇貨便宜到底不免讓金錢外溢。他們有時也想在日人方面得點好處·但又不願被人駡爲賣國求榮。他們有時也想擁護宣統皇帝·但又怕加上一個漢奸的頭銜。他們覺悟了自身的危險而憤憤然趨於革命’但又怕人頭掛在城墻上鮮血淋漓。他們懂得被剝削大衆着實可憐’但又不同意他們澈底反抗。他們很知道自身的走頭無路·但總以爲天不絶人還有一綫生機。他們·········。</p>
<p>總之·此所謂之第三種人’此所謂之長衫同志。他們悲哀·他們苦痛。然則他們的出路在那裏呢？諸君如有興趣·且聽下回分解。</p>
<h3>病中絮語</h3>
<p>— 炳</p>
<p>因爲第一次去遲了’所以輪到了五十八號’足足等了兩個鐘頭·於是第二次我便早一點鏡就去’到院時看看手上　的錶’離掛號時間還有二十五分’自己想該不會再像昨日那樣等了’從容地踱往掛號處去’呵’病人早己蜂窠似的擁擠了’我一見就頭痛’原來早到也和遲到一樣呵！</p>
<p>我深感着這一層苦’回家時偶爾與Ｃ君談及’他說那兒的掛號人Ｓ君與他很熟’於是第三次我便邀了Ｃ君同去’果然方便了不少’到塲就掛得了號’然而號次已是二十七’也總還要等上一點鐘’Ｓ君忙來招呼我們坐一息’掛號的人’已先有了這麽多’我們自然只有坐下等着。</p>
<p>約摸過了一刻鐘光景’精神疲乏的我瞌睡起來了’這被Ｓ君見了’他急忙走來’把我手裏的牌子拿了去’隨着就呌我上樓’這是他的好意’本來號次還隔得遠’因爲他向裏面照應好了’所以我得以越號先診。然而我的内心忽然而不安起來’這並不是因爲勞駕了Ｓ君’而是眼見號次在先’病勢嚴重的幾位生朋友’面容憔悴的兩眼緊釘着樓口’而竟被我無情槍先去了’又要他們久等幾分鐘’這是對？不對？</p>
<p>我想來想去’眞不該在這兒佔别人的便宜’同時’Ｓ君出賣這種人情’更</p>
<p>是不正的行爲。</p>
<p>由此更使我聯想遠了’我只認識一個掛號的人’便便宜了到塲掛號’不要去擠’更便宜搶先應診’若是我更認識那兒的醫生’免不了不要掛號便可街上樓去’而且那醫生會怎樣認眞的給我仔細診察’看出我的病源並不在頸項的一塊小痛處’而是怎樣的一種重傷風’若果頸上的痛處確是淋巴腺也儘有救治的良方’萬萬不會向我使白眼’向我搖頭’隨便給我看看’便妄下診斷。若是我更認識那藥室裏的人’那麽我去配藥’</p>
<p>他决不會以一小瓶嗽口水要討我四角大</p>
<p>洋’加討點點紗布橡皮膠·又一文不能少的要三角。</p>
<p>統而言之’假使我認識那兒的醫生’配藥員’我想我或不致拖上這十天的病苦·也不致用掉上十元的藥費。</p>
<p>現在的社會’本來就是個人情的社會’人情可以神通廣大’一般人慣習買賣人情’以致把公事公德都丢了不顧’就我這次的診病與掛號人Ｓ君的買賣人情’便可概見一班。</p>
<p>然而人情的出賣是不是對呢？尤其在醫院的塲合’是何等的有害於大衆！　　我想至此’我寫至此’不禁惘然了</p>

<h3>紅綠燈下（三十四）</h3>
<p>— 禧林</p>
<p>實際上’在我們中國’任何運動都祗是在報紙上存在的。現在讓我們看這些愛國運動者的跳躍罷：</p>
<p>這幾天的王化可特别眉飛色舞了。自從前天租了一輛包車坐起來’在馬路上兜了個圈子’在路上遇着他的人’　都肯招呼他談些話。他坐在車上’趾高氣揚地看看街上的行人’再看看自己車下那發亮的鋼絲輪。那種小人自得的情態’簡直令人噴飯。但所謂上海名流’聞人却往往便是這種小人造成的。王化當然要向這路上前進的’而且這路線正在擴大着：他正在想怎樣使ⅩⅩⅩⅩ團體聯合會也能募捐抗日捐欵’募了抗日捐欵’旣可以結識幾個抗日軍事領袖’以收異日見效’又可以從中揩油丨丨至少總可以揩油一點’他不相信那許多什麽會大批的捐欵都能如數的到達軍隊的手裏。以裏這樣想着’口裏隨即向包車夫喊道：</p>
<p>」快點’朝西’朝西！「</p>
<p>包車夫快步走了一箭之路’原來已經到了目的地。照規矩先交進名片’然後被請了進去。客廳裏坐滿了五六個長衫大褂的人’當中一個身裁特别短小的像蚱蜢似的一跳地站了起來：</p>
<p>」啊’好久不見了’米司特王！裏面請坐！「</p>
<p>這矮子主人我們是看見過的’就是李石喬第一次陪三姨太參加吳子卿公館那茶舞會時所偶然看到的寗波經濟學博士’出名的大學敎授’王化和李石喬曾經都是他的學生’坐在客廳裏的那些長衫客都不免是上海金融界巨頭’看那形勢’顯然在商議一件什麽機密事件。王化被請到裏面一間客廳’矮子敎授很客氣的招待他坐下。自己擦了擦手掌’等待王化說出來意。</p>
<p>」一向想來拜望李先生！「王化偏不肯免去一套寒喧’移了些時才說：」我今天代表ⅩⅩⅩⅩ團體聯合會有點事情來請求先生的。我們自從聯絡到這百餘團體成立聯合會以後’覺得自己的力量到底薄弱’非常慚塊’現在毫無實際工作表現············「說到此又停止了。他曉得說這種堂皇冠冕的話是不適宜的’尤其對這位經濟學博士的性格他是十分淸楚的。於是便改了一種很親切的表情’座位移攏一些’聲氣特别放得低：</p>
<p>」李先生’你當然能體恤我的意思’提携你的學生你總願意的。現在這個團體全是我們同學如李石喬胡元良等主持的’我們趁這機會應該打出一點基礎才奸。組織了一個團體’總得拿出成績給人家看。可是我們都是人微言輕’說話還沒有力量’我們非請你爲我們帮忙不可’現在就是我們預備以團體的名義公開募抗日揩欵’地位很低的我們尙不足使人相信　康概應捐　我們來請李先生　　幾　　　　召號召　將來捐得的欵’　李先生支　贈送就是’我們都是你的學生’沒有不德命令的。</p>

<h3>希特勒統治下的德國電影界（上）</h3>
<p>— 黄君如</p>
<p>最近德國的電影界’可說差不多已經完全法西斯化了。國社黨在這樣短時期裏’能夠把德國電影全部法西斯化’其原因究竟是甚麽呢？不用說一方面是由於希特勒執政後所採取的高壓政策（嚴厲的檢查）；但另一方面也實由於烏發公司經理胡根堡入閣就任經濟部長’和希特勒自身平時對於電影宣傅力之關心。當希特勒未獲得政權之前’早已製作數本宣傳黨敎的影片。迨獲得政權後’即時在閣内設立」宣傳部「’除新聞’演劇·無線電’國民敎育各局外’更增設電影局。最初的宣傳部長則任命國社黨宣傳部長高博爾博士。由高博爾之手着着進行希特勒的電影政策’露骨的標明了電影國營之氣運’對全聯邦電影事業舉行積極干涉’使電影業者陷於極度不安。</p>
<p>但是’政府對於電影企業界的不安’也不能完全漠視’故最近高博爾曾用自己之名發表了一篇長文’裏面說近來關於德國電影企業的將來’有惹起不安’使企業慾衰落的各種憶測；但這種憂慮是完全無根據的。政府目下對於電影法規正在銳意起草中’這不僅確保德國電影經濟的獨立’而且將尊重民間的創造權’决不拘束電影從業者的自由。至於說宣傳部將强制電影從業者製作某種宣傅影片云云’更是無稽之談。</p>
<p>雖然如此’但這不過是政府體面的辯明’而對於法西斯影片的製作和開映之保護’以及他種影片所受嚴格的檢查’仍是採取偏狹的黨派態度。例如」早晨「」羅殿的合唱「等法西斯影片最後一次開映時’總理希特勒’副總理巴本’經濟部長胡根堡等閣僚曾經到塲參觀以壯氣勢。」早晨「是以歐洲大戰中德國的Ｕ·Ｂｏａｔ大型潛航艇之活躍爲題材的海戰影片。牠不僅爲烏發公司近來最大的作品’同時也是法西斯化最成功的影片。」羅殿合唱「是以弗立特列大王一七五七年在西西亞的羅殿殲滅奥軍的赫赫武勲之故事爲題材的歷史劇’也爲烏　公司出品。這明顯是讚美弗立特列大王與鼓吹普魯士精神的愛國影片。</p>
<p>上面巳經說過’國社黨曾有黨製作的影片。最近在伯林開映的」流血的德意志「即其中之一。此片本爲國社黨未獲得政權之前攝製者’當時因被社會民主黨政府禁止開映’故至今方得開演。此片以一八七零年至一九三三年初頭的德國歷史’即從斯丹之役’凱　爾的加冕式起至國社黨抬頭止的德國歷史爲題材的歷史片。（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評」野鴛鴦「ＮｏＯｔｈｅｒＷｏｍａｎ</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>雷電華出品南京開映　　首先我覺得有介紹本事的必要。　　一個鋼鐵廠的工人名傑姆者’和一個村女安娜相愛而結婚。在他們的同伴中有一少年專心從事於染料的製作’頗爲安娜所器重’不久’少年之染料成績極佳’傑姆由於妻之勸誘而投資於染料製作’於是一舉而富’同時得一子。其後’傑姆邂逅一色艶之蕩婦’以致貧賤夫妻終於相見法庭。傑姆誣女有外遇’並以此爲離婚理由。妻於痛心之餘’立允離異’但求其子不爲傑姆領去’蓋以己旣有外遇’此子並非傑姆所生。此時傑姆愧感交集’同時因愛子過甚’乃毅然翻改口供’歷舉子爲己生之確證’並宣佈諸證人之受賄言讒。願將離婚案取消’但法庭却以其誣告而投獄。刑期旣滿’傑姆仍爲鐵廠工人’然不久’安娜復與其諧好。</p>
<p>在這一故事中’我們可看出作者的主旨’無非是敎人們力圖上進’雖一工人亦未常不可成爲富翁。同時决不可迷於女色而厭糟糠’所謂賢妻良母’堪爲女範。然而這種說敎是非常薄弱的’特别是以一工人之微弱工資’在日常生活中祇能吃馬鈴　和包粟度日’居然能成爲富翁’眞令人不敢想像。然而這正是殺人的棄藥。」兩秒鐘「　面敎他們買彩票發財’正和本片是同一的宣傅方法。至於在日前經濟危機日益加重的情形之</p>
<p>中’本片作者仍作着甜蜜的幻想’更是使人發笑的了。次之’如發財之後而迷於女色’固然我們不能否認這是現社會應有的現象’然而僅僅是這樣來觀出賢妻良母的婦德’却也不見高妙。何况嫁一而終的良妻’是否在現實的經濟制度之下還能繼續存在呢？而且僅這樣是否就可以挽救頽風呢？即退一步說’也不過是平凡的故事而已。</p>
<p>就形式上說’那末這是一個悲劇。但是整個的演出’是沒有做到動人情感的程度。雖然安娜的身世’很値得傷感的人們十分同情’當她眼看着丈夫和另一女人戲謔而被人遺棄的時候。但是導演對於情感的處理不能强調’所以安娜的苦楚終於不能打動人們的悲哀。很明白的這是對於她的描寫大少的原故。然而另一方面’導演對於傑姆的描寫却很精細’而且也是一貫的。關於蕩婦也很可以。至於他以高速度的手法來處理不必要的過程’固然很見經濟’但在蕩婦勾通律師來賄賂證人的經過’却太省事’以致法庭的一幕’顯見突如其來。同時法庭中是一最高潮’然而繁雜的對話’却令人不耐。愛蓮頓（ＩｒｅｎｅＤｕｎｎｅ）的</p>
<p>表演’較之」歌臺恨史「差得多。却利斯畢克福（ＣｈａｒＩｅｓ　Ｃｉｃｋｆｏｒｄ）很好。整個的說’這是一部庸俗的作品。</p>
<h3>程步高避暑天曉得</h3>
<p>這幾天程步高導演的」春蠶「正在柏一個大塲面的戲’露天攝影塲上’由佈景部搭成了一個人造的邨莊’茅舍竹籬’小橋流水’幾隻白鵝在溪中游着呌着。風景幽麗。十分動人。導演部一般職員’常常望梅止渴地對着那假村莊說：」這樣大熱天’到鄕邨中去避避暑’多好啊！「有一次程步高拍好了戲’滿頭大汗地進來休息’大家就打趣他說：」步高你眞寫意天天下鄉去避暑。「但是程步高却笑着說：」這樣的避暑’天曉得’我實在不敢領敎！「</p>
<h3>關於」敎育電影「</h3>
<p>— 仲</p>
<p>電影這種東西’以前大家只曉得是供人娛樂：到了而今’才有人瞭然於它的效用是很廣大。於是政黨拿它來作宣傳政策政見的工具’商業家拿它來作擴張業務的利器’以及其他各項事業的進行’莫不在利用着它了。於是現在又有」敎育電影「的發起’而且組織起」敎育電影恊會「來。」敎育電影「’顧名思義’當然是爲提倡敎育性的電影’也便是要利用電影的偉力’來推進敎育。</p>
<p>不錯’敎育可以分開兩方面的意義：一是普通的敎育’一則是社會敎育。普通的敎育’也便是學校敎育。現在的學校敎育方式’太呆板了。一般在學的兒童和靑年’他們都不喜歡那種呆板的敎室生活。敎育電影便利用他們愛好電影的本能’來從電影上灌輸他們以新鮮的智識’以輔助現行敎育方法的不逮。社會敎育呢’是對社會上一般民衆的敎育而言。大多數的民衆’渾渾噩噩’不識不知。我們要挽救國家於埀亡’必須要使他們獲得智識；而要使他們獲得知識’莫如利用電影的力量來作敎育他們的工具。</p>
<p>今我爲維護敎育電影起見’敬謹貢其一得之愚如下：</p>

<p>(London) It is widely rumored among well-informed sources here that George Cadogan, the brother of Earl Cadogan, may succeed Lampson as the ambassador to China in December. As for Lampson's promotion to ambassador to Turkey, it has been rumored for a long time and is expected to be announced soon. However, when these two claims were questioned by the Foreign Office today, they could not be confirmed. It is said that neither appointment has been finalized at the moment. Regarding Cadogan's ambassadorship to China, it may still be in the consultation and agreement phase. According to reports, Cadogan has recently served as the Permanent Deputy Representative to the League of Nations and has had close contact with the development of the Far East situation.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Reactions to China and the League of Nations' Technical Cooperation</h3>
<p>The technical cooperation between China and the League of Nations has been under discussion for over two years since it was proposed. Recently, on one hand, as a result of the meeting of the "League of Nations Administrative Council's China Technical Cooperation Committee" in Paris, the scope of cooperation was determined, and Mr. Rajchman was dispatched as a liaison officer, indicating a trend of active progress. On the other hand, in the Far East, it has triggered a serious reaction, with the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs instructing its ambassadors abroad to threaten various countries to abandon their pro-China policies with phrases such as "not hesitating to resort to acts of self-defense similar to the Manchurian and Shanghai incidents," greatly demonstrating that this reaction cannot be ignored. Before the specific plans for technical cooperation between China and the League of Nations are fully announced, we have no way to know the details. According to news from Nanjing, the projects to be jointly undertaken mainly include the construction of heavy industry, water management, railway cooperation, new health facilities, and agricultural improvement. The Paris conference also agreed on the principle of "purely technical and not political" cooperation. Superficially, the Chinese people do not need to fundamentally oppose the government's actions. However, at a time when the world economic conference has failed and economic competition among the powers in the Far East has intensified, this large-scale international cooperation project, even without the crisis of political co-administration, is sufficient to allow various forces of European and American economic imperialism to penetrate deeply into China, creating difficult problems for the future. Chinese intellectuals are deeply concerned about this major event related to the nation's destiny, engaging in extensive research into the advantages and disadvantages. They may not immediately agree with it simply because of the general trend of needing cooperation.</p>
<p>Currently, there is no reaction within China, but Japan, an enemy of China, has already risen up in opposition. The reason for its opposition is based on the special relationship between Japan and China and Japan's position in Asia, clearly indicating its ambition for an Asian Monroe Doctrine, which cannot be recognized by China and the international community. As for the statement that "China abandons close friends (?)</p>
<p>and seeks distant gains," its meaning is still the so-called policy of using barbarians to control barbarians. This can be said to be an attempt to exhaust the ability to provoke and alienate. The September 18th Mukden Incident was triggered in part by Japan's jealousy of the League of Nations' passage of the ten-year plan for the construction of China, which we have already discussed before. (See the current affairs commentary on the 5th of this month.) Now, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs says: "If the assistance of various countries to China provokes China to decide to take actions against Manchuria and to resist Japan, then Japan will not hesitate to resort to acts of self-defense similar to the Manchurian and Shanghai incidents." The spokesperson of the Japanese Embassy in China said: "If there is any manifestation of political</p>
<p>influence...the emergence of a second Manchuria or the occurrence of a second Shanghai incident cannot be guaranteed by anyone." Is Japan therefore trying to declare war on the world with this? The fundamental error of Japan's opposition and threatening words this time lies in its belief in the League of Nations' weakness and the division of China into European and American factions and Japanese factions. We do not want to speculate on whether the League of Nations will continue its weak attitude and change its policy of cooperation with China due to Japan's opposition and threats. However, in China, except for a few traitors, no one can be used by Japan, as can be seen from the recent psychology of the people. However, our research on the advantages and disadvantages of major national issues cannot be affected by Japan's actions this time.</p>
<p>Japan's Policy Wavering on a Fork in the Road</p>
<h3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Military Decide on So-Called Defensive Hard-Line Policy Toward China</h3>
<p>However, some advocate softening towards us</p>
<h3>Our Cooperation with the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Japan's anxiety is evident in its words</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the military have already decided on a policy of defensive quiet observation as the main approach of Japan's policy towards China. After the establishment of the Sino-Japanese armistice agreement, they attempted to strengthen this policy in North China. However, recently, there have been rumors that Song Ziwen, the representative of China attending the World Economic Conference, signed a cotton and wheat loan of 50 million yuan with the United States, and that a British financial group is conducting a contract for a 5 million pound loan. It is also said that as a result of Song's negotiations with Zhang Xueliang, contracts were signed with European countries to purchase weapons. Therefore, some in the Japanese political world observe that after Song returns to China, the European and American factions of the National Government will suppress the Japanese faction and shift again to an anti-Japanese policy. Therefore, there is a gradual increase in the argument that Japan should also implement some kind of understanding movement before the League of Nations' China Technical Cooperation Committee crosses the sea to China. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the military hold the following views, and are determined to adhere to the established policy of quiet observation: 1. Regarding China's policy of serving a larger power and using barbarians to control barbarians, various countries have had painful experiences since the Washington Conference. Therefore, Japan has no choice but to deal with China with a tough attitude. 2. From the September 18th Incident to the establishment of the Sino-Japanese armistice negotiations at the end of May this year, Japan spent huge sums of money and precious national sacrifices, and felt that the core of its policy towards China lies in a defensive and hard-line approach. However, some people are now advocating soft arguments. The government absolutely avoids adopting such a softened policy towards China. 3. Therefore, if other countries implement improper aid policies towards China in the future, causing chaos in China's internal affairs, Japan must resolutely eliminate such policies of other countries, and at the same time seriously monitor the activities of the League of Nations' China Cooperation Committee. 4. Although other countries superficially cooperate with China, Japan will never send any powerful representatives to China to actively request the Chinese government to shake hands. Japan will always deal with China with a hard-line policy of self-defense and independent action. (Jiji News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang Visits the Verdun Battlefield</h3>

During his time in Paris, he will meet with French Prime Minister Daladier and French Minister of Aviation Cot. On July 31, Zhang will go to England for a ten-day stay, and then may visit Germany.</p>
<h3>No Hope for Russo-Japanese Trade Agreement</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Sokolnikov proposed the issue of concluding a Russo-Japanese trade treaty to Japanese Ambassador Ota on July 15. As a result of considering its countermeasures, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to temporarily not consider this issue because the trade treaties concluded by the Soviet Union with various countries are all beneficial to itself, and Russo-Japanese trade has not reached a balance. Therefore, the issue of a Russo-Japanese trade treaty is completely hopeless. (Jiji News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Puppet Organization to Declare Unilateral Reform of CER</h3>
<p>(Harbin) According to informed sources, Morita, the representative of the puppet state's Ministry of Communications, will issue a declaration on July 24 to the Soviet administrators of the Chinese Eastern Railway, detailing matters such as the fair price of gold rubles, the reform of the railway, and the powers of the Soviet director. One of the clauses states that the reform is based on the 1924 agreement and therefore does not require Soviet approval or ratification. (Reuters dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Songhu Garrison Headquarters to be Abolished</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Dai Ji, the commander of the Songhu Garrison, has been transferred to the post of Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Fujian Province. According to a certain military authority, the duties of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters can be replaced by the Security Office. In fact, there is no need to set up this organization, and the name of the garrison implies martial law, which does not seem appropriate for the environment of Shanghai. Wu Tiecheng discussed this issue with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek when he went to Jiangxi to visit him a few days ago, and Chiang agreed. Therefore, after Commander Dai completes the handover, the central government may issue an order to abolish it. The so-called successor is just speculation. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>

<p>Greatest Achievement of World Economic Conference</p>
<h3>Full Text of Silver Agreement Published</h3>
<p>(London) The full text of the Silver Agreement states: Because the governments of India and Spain may sell a certain percentage of their existing silver reserves, and for the benefit of silver-producing countries, silver should be absorbed to offset its sale, and because, for the benefit of silver-producing countries, the sale of old currency silver should be restricted, and for the benefit of China, the sale of currency silver should be offset by purchases, in order to stabilize the price of silver, it is now agreed that the Indian government shall not sell more than 140 million ounces of silver in the four years from January 2, 1934. The amount sold in each of these four years shall be based on an annual average of 35 million ounces, but if the Indian government sells less than 35 million ounces of silver in any year, the difference may be added to the next year's sale, provided that the amount of silver sold in any one year shall not exceed 50 million ounces at most. If, after the date of this agreement, the Indian government sells silver to any government to pay off war debts to the US government, this silver shall not be within the scope of this agreement, but if the total amount of the aforementioned sales, together with the sales stipulated by the Indian government under this agreement, reaches as much as 175 million ounces, the obligations of the contracting parties shall cease. The governments of Australia, Canada, the United States, Mexico, and Peru shall not sell any silver during the existence of this agreement, that is, in any year of the four years from 1934, and shall purchase or attempt to stop the sale of 35 million ounces of mined silver. The aforementioned five governments undertake to jointly agree on the respective amounts of their purchases or attempts to stop the sale within the 35 million ounces. The silver so purchased or the sale of which is prohibited by the five countries shall be kept for monetary purposes (i.e., for minting coins and for use as currency reserves), or preserved without investment for four years. The Chinese government shall not melt coins and sell silver during these four years. The Spanish government shall not sell more than a total of 20 million ounces of silver in the four years from January 1, 1934. The amount sold each year shall be based on an average of 5 million ounces. If less than this amount of silver is sold in any one year, the difference may be added to the next year's sale, provided that the total amount sold in any one year is limited to 7 million ounces. The relevant governments shall exchange various necessary information to facilitate the implementation of this agreement, and the undertaking of each signatory country shall be conditional on the resumption of undertaking by other signatory countries. This agreement shall be subject to the approval of the governments of the relevant countries, and the signed texts shall be sent to the US government for safekeeping before April 1, 1934. After the signed texts are received before April 1, 1934, this agreement shall be implemented. Any government's notification stating that the actions necessary to implement this agreement have been taken may be regarded as the signed text, but if one or more of the five countries of Australia, Canada, the United States, Mexico, and Peru have not ratified it before April 1, 1934, and the remaining governments of these five countries that have ratified it notify other governments that have also ratified this agreement, stating that they are prepared to purchase or prevent the sale of the number of silver that the five countries should purchase or prevent the sale of as stipulated in this agreement, this agreement shall take effect. Now, please ask the US government to take the steps necessary to establish this agreement. (Reuters dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Silver Agreement Consolidates Our Silver Position</h3>
<p>(London) Reuters has learned that the Silver Agreement stipulates that India's sales are limited to 35 million ounces per year for four years, and Spain's sales are limited to 5 million ounces per year. Other silver-producing countries agree to purchase a total of 35 million ounces from their domestic silver mines to offset India and Spain's sales. Easterners believe that this agreement is very satisfactory and can consolidate China's silver position, and it does not hinder India from implementing its policy of selling surplus silver at a reasonable price. The representatives of India, China, and Spain, who attended the World Economic Conference with the qualifications of countries with large silver reserves or silver-using countries, and the representatives of Australia, Canada, the United States, Mexico, and Peru, with the qualifications of silver-producing countries, established this agreement, mentioning the motion passed by the second group of the Monetary Committee on July 20. (Reuters dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) The nine-nation silver understanding can be called the greatest achievement of the six weeks of discussions at the World Economic Conference. Although the understanding is nominally between nine countries, it can only be called an eight-country understanding in practice at this time, because the Bolivian representative has not yet signed. According to the Bolivian representative, there is no doubt that the country will join, and it is only waiting for special instructions from its government before it can sign. Australia and China did not go to the Savoy Hotel to sign until midnight after slightly modifying a certain wording in the agreement. One of the modifications was to change the name of the document to an understanding instead of an agreement. However, apart from this modification, the entire document had already been signed during the day, and the final approval was only for signing this modification. At present, it seems that this nine-nation understanding still needs to be accompanied by a supplementary document, specially agreed upon by the five countries of the United States, Australia, Canada, Mexico, and Peru, to purchase a certain fixed amount of silver each year in addition to the regular amount of silver stipulated in the understanding. It is expected that this supplementary understanding will be published on Monday. (Kuo Min News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia Conducting Large-Scale Maneuvers in Outer Mongolia</h3>

<h3>Various Countries to Pay Our Country's Telegram Fees in Legal Tender in the Future</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) In the past, the payment of international telegram fees payable to our country by various countries was mostly made in US dollars. Since the United States abandoned the gold standard, the price of gold has plummeted. If the payment is still made in US dollars, our losses will be very large. The Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Communications telegraphed the council of the □□ Association, stating that in the future, the payment of telegram fees payable to our country by various countries will be temporarily changed to payment in legal tender, calculated at a rate of 4.9249 yuan of legal tender per gold franc, and instructed it to notify the telecommunications bureaus of various countries to take note.

<h3>Zhou Yashi Talks About Rumors of Military Officers' Salary Increases Being Untrue</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhou Yashi, the deputy director of training, said that the rumored establishment of three ranks of general, marshal, and grand marshal has not been heard of by the training directorate. The organizational law of our country's national government originally stipulates that the chairman concurrently serves as the grand marshal of the army, navy, and air force, so there is no need to add three more ranks. It is also rumored that the salaries of all ranks above lieutenant will be increased by one-third and that this will be submitted to the Central Political Conference. At present, the national treasury is stretched, and even the original salaries have not been restored, let alone an increase. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>

<p>After Internal Strife in Hitler's Party Army</p>
<h3>Internal Situation Tense in Germany</h3>
<p>Göring Suppresses Rebels with Ruthless Measures</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 22nd: The internal situation in Germany has recently become tense again. Prussian Prime Minister Göring has shortened his vacation and flown back to Berlin from the summer resort of Sylt Island in the North Sea. After returning to Berlin, Göring immediately met with journalists and announced that the situation had reached an extremely serious point, because the forces previously resisting the government were only superficially subdued, but there was a constant threat of resurgence. Therefore, the Prussian government had no choice but to take severe measures to maintain the dignity of the state and the success of the National Socialist movement.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 22nd: Prussian Interior Minister Göring, who was on vacation, has rushed back to Berlin. After holding an emergency meeting with cabinet members and other dignitaries today, he stated that a bill will be submitted to the cabinet stipulating that anyone who plots against public officials and stormtroopers, or disseminates propaganda that endangers the dignity and survival of the state, will be sentenced to death. This measure is now necessary because the enemies of the nation, the communists, have apparently not been completely eliminated. From now on, anyone who incites or intends to incite, or supports or plans to kill public prosecutors, police, or members of the stormtroopers, will be sentenced to death. Anyone who writes rebellious texts or instigates people to resist the authorities or violates the regulations prohibiting associations will also be sentenced to death. Not only will the offenders be punished according to the law, but also the family members of the offenders who live in the same house will lose all their civil rights. Special courts will be established to ensure that the death sentences that have been handed down are executed as quickly as possible, regardless of the circumstances. Göring also stated that those who had previously been convicted by the National Socialist Party could be pardoned, but any irregular actions in the future would be regarded as acts of sabotage against the National Socialist Party and the state and would be punished accordingly. Göring's return to Berlin was due to the startling disturbances among the stormtroopers after Hitler announced that the revolution had now ended.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 22nd: State officials of the Prussian state today amended the Prussian state constitution to grant the power to pardon criminals to the Prussian state premier. Based on this power, Prussian Interior Minister Göring specifically ordered the commander-in-chief to grant pardons to criminals during the National Socialist Party revolution last year, i.e., from March 25 to July 15. At the same time, the Minister of Justice has established special courts to severely and swiftly investigate cases of attacks on police and National Socialist Party personnel. These courts will handle all important cases of this kind and will work closely with Göring's secret police. Göring today appointed Prince Wilhelm as a member of the Prussian State Council.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 22nd: It is widely rumored that several spies who are enemies of the National Socialist Party have secretly joined the National Socialist Party, attempting to incite party members to mistreat political enemies in order to provide them with evidence of the brutality of the National Socialist Party. To prevent this, the National Socialist Party today issued a special order to all party members not to be incited by dangerous elements. If any member of the National Socialist Party engages in such behavior, he should be arrested and detained.</p>
<h3>German-Hungarian Trade Agreement Signed, Opening Up New Avenues</h3>
<p>Restoring Ancient Commodity Trade</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 22nd: The newly signed trade agreement between Germany and Hungary was signed today in Berlin. The final consultations on this agreement took place in Germany between July 14 and 22, but the discussion of this agreement had already begun in the Hungarian capital in June. The most important point is the realization of the compensation trade law. According to this law, trade between the two countries can be conducted through commodity trading organizations without having to pay for goods in foreign currency. As it stands now, Hungary can send agricultural products to Germany in exchange for German industrial products, thus avoiding difficulties in exchange rates.</p>
<h3>France Intends to Conclude Non-Aggression Pact with Soviet Russia</h3>
<p>Finland Has Joined the Pact</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 22nd: According to the remarks made today by French Foreign Minister Peng Gu, if other Western European countries join the eight-nation non-aggression pact signed in London on July 1 by Russia, Turkey, Poland, the Little Entente countries, and the Baltic states regarding the definition of aggression, then France would also be willing to sign.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Moscow, 22nd: Today, the Russian Foreign Office announced that Finland has signed the eight-nation non-aggression pact, which contains Litvinov's proposed definition of aggressor. Among the small countries bordering Soviet Russia, Finland was the last to sign.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Orders Workers to Relocate to Rural Areas</h3>

<h3>Suzuki's Entry into Cabinet in Japanese Political Situation</h3>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 23rd: Recently, some members of the Seiyukai Party, in order to break the deadlock inside and outside the party, intend to abandon the principle of right and wrong that they have always decided on, and, according to the government's wishes, have President Suzuki enter the cabinet to actively support the current cabinet, so as to benefit the party's credibility in the future. Seita Kinoshta, of the self-respecting faction, has been running around to various elders in recent days, and mentioned it at the general affairs meeting on the 19th night. It is also rumored that Minister of Education Hatoyama is considering the future of the president and has also advised the president to enter the cabinet. However, the party leaders stated that since the party had declared a month ago that it would not support the current cabinet, and there has been no objective change in the situation, suddenly advising the president to enter the cabinet would be tantamount to showing the party's lack of integrity and approaching shamelessness. Not only the cadres such as Yamaguchi, Shimada, and Hama think this way, but also President Suzuki himself has expressed opposition, and it is feared that it will be difficult to achieve. Although the government and some members of the Seiyukai Party say that an Minister without portfolio should be established and the party should send people to enter the cabinet, the Seiyukai's entry into the cabinet does not necessarily have to be limited to</p>
<h3>Hollywood Strike</h3>
<p>(Havas, Hollywood, 22nd) Technicians at eleven film production studios have declared a strike. Approximately 27,000 workers and actors are affected and have stopped working. There is a risk that their work contracts may be terminated. President Suzuki will negotiate with Mr. Tokonami, who advocates for supporting the current cabinet. From the perspective of party affairs, the majority of the Seiyukai party may support this proposal. Some believe that Mr. Tokonami may join the cabinet before the budget is finalized and before the Diet convenes. Regarding this matter, President Suzuki told reporters that the rumors of his joining the cabinet are completely unfounded. Our party, considering the past performance of the current cabinet, has already declared to the world that they lack the ability to handle the current situation. There have been no subsequent changes. Therefore, for the sake of the party's strategy, we cannot join the cabinet. Our actions are definitely not aimed at acquiring political power; we will always act with the nation's interests as our priority.</p>
<p>His tone was quite resolute.</p>
<p>Sun Dianying's troops are heading to Qinghai and have withdrawn from the defense areas south of Xuanhua, including Huailai, Shacheng, Chicheng, and Xiahuayuan. The majority of the troops are still between Xuanhua and Chaigoubu. Some have already arrived in Baotou, and some are being transported from Chaigoubu to Baotou. Sun Dianying himself has gone to Baotou from Chaigoubu. According to personnel of the army stationed in Peiping, the authorities originally promised to allocate 100,000 yuan for departure expenses, as well as advance funds for the fifth and sixth months' salaries and the allowance for the eighth and ninth months. Now, the departure expenses have been allocated, but only the fourth installment of the monthly salary and the allowance for the seventh and eighth months have been issued. The remaining funds have not been released. It is estimated that over one million yuan is needed en route to Qinghai. After advancing the funds for the fifth and sixth months' salaries and the September allowance, approximately 300,000 yuan will be available, leaving a shortfall of over 600,000 yuan. Efforts should be made to secure this amount from the central government, but there is no sign of progress. Departure is proving to be extremely difficult. The underlying meaning of these statements is quite thought-provoking. The departure of the army has been extremely slow in recent days, and it is feared that it will be difficult to leave the territory of Chahar completely in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Although the Chahar peace movement is in a stalemate, informal contacts continue. Huang Fu's representative, Ma Boyuan, visited Feng Yuxiang in Zhangjiakou a few days ago and returned to Peiping this morning (22nd). Feng gave Ma a personal letter to be delivered to Huang, expressing three points: 1) The anti-Japanese purpose remains unchanged. 2) To seek peace, the troops that entered Chahar must be withdrawn. 3) The abolition of the Anti-Japanese Army title must wait until a proper resolution is found for the various armies in Chahar Province. After getting off the train, Ma immediately went to Fengzeyuan to meet Huang Fu, reporting on his trip and conveying Feng's intentions. Huang said that he would consult with Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei before further discussion, and asked Ma to stay in Peiping in case he needed to go to Chahar again. It is said that Huang Fu, recognizing the importance of the Chahar situation, still advocates for a peaceful resolution and has sent long telegrams to Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei for instructions. According to Ma's conversation with reporters, he met with Feng three times in Zhangjiakou. Feng also telegraphed Ji Hongchang to Zhangjiakou for consultation. Feng expressed great sympathy for peace, but stated that his anti-Japanese stance remained firm and hoped that all parties would not misunderstand and, furthermore, would not exert pressure on Zhangjiakou, so that actual peace could be achieved.

<h3>Japanese and Puppet Troops Await Opportunity to Invade Chahar Territory</h3>
<p>Most Are Concentrated, Targeting Dagu</p>
<p>Central Government Troops Await Orders to Enter Chahar</p>
<p>Huang Fu Still Hopes for Peaceful Resolution of the Chahar Issue</p>
<p>A special dispatch from Peiping: Since the recapture of Dolon, Japanese troops, using the excuse of violating the truce agreement, have been actively increasing their troops along the border of Rehe and Chahar. It has been discovered that the cavalry of Mogi and the rebel troops of Cui Xingwu have concentrated around Weichang, Jingpeng, and the Zizishan area. The Hiraga Brigade of the Eighth Division and the puppet troops of Zhang HaiPeng are also concentrating in areas such as Fengning and Dage, targeting Dolon and Guyuan, preparing to invade eastern Chahar. Japanese planes have also been flying over Dolon, Guyuan, Baochang, and other places for reconnaissance in recent days. However, the Japanese and puppet troops seem to be waiting and observing, wanting to take advantage of internal changes in Chahar before reaping the benefits. Feng's troops, including Ji Hongchang and Li Zhongyi's units, are currently stationed in Dolon. Liu Guitang's troops are stationed near Guyuan, maintaining strict vigilance to prevent the invasion of Japanese and puppet troops. The situation in eastern Chahar is akin to the situation before the Japanese invasion of Rehe.</p>
<p>The armies entering Chahar from Peiping: Pang Bingxun's troops are stationed in Huailai, Zhuolu, Xiahuayuan, and other places; Guan Linzheng's division is stationed north of Kangzhuang, along the railway line. There are considerable preparations between Xiahuayuan and Shacheng. Feng's troops, Fang Zhenwu and Sun Liangcheng's armies, are constructing fortifications in the Xuanhua and Xinzhuangzi area. The outposts of the two sides are only about twenty li apart. Sun Liangcheng is stationed in Xuanhua, commanding. Fang Zhenwu previously went to Xuanhua from Zhangjiakou and has now returned to Zhangjiakou. Pang Bingxun himself travels between Huailai and Xiahuayuan, inspecting defenses and convening officers and soldiers for instructions. Pang's troops were originally part of the former National Third Army and, together with Xu Yongchang, were under the command of Sun Yue. After the failure of the National Army, they were once under Feng Yuxiang's control, so there are many former Northwest Army personnel in the unit. The regimental commander of a certain regiment that arrived in Xiahuayuan was replaced by Pang due to certain relationships. The two battalions under his command automatically left Xiahuayuan and went to Zhangjiakou. Guan Linzheng arrived in Kangzhuang the other day, and his troops are quietly awaiting orders.</p>
<p>Song Zheyuan's attitude is unusually indifferent due to the difficulty of mediating the Chahar affairs. His subordinates, Liu Ruming and Zhang Zizhong, and others strongly advocate for peace and are quite passionate. Since Pang Bingxun was ordered to enter Chahar, Feng's aides and former Northwest Army personnel have sent numerous letters and telegrams, expressing their opinions about Pang. A few days ago, Feng again sent his secretary-general Zhang Yunrong to Xiahuayuan to see Pang, explaining everything. At the same time, Yue Xiangru also sent a telegram to Pang, seemingly offering advice. However, Pang believes that this entry into Chahar is an order from the central government and that as a soldier, he only knows how to obey orders. His attitude is</p>

<p>American Aviator Sets New Record for Round-the-World Flight</p>
<h3>Post Flies Solo Around the World, Enduring Hardships and Finally Returning to New York</h3>
<p>(National News Agency, New York, 22nd) American aviator Wiley Post, who flew solo around the world, has safely returned to Floyd Bennett Field here at midnight today after braving countless dangers and overcoming all kinds of difficulties amidst exhaustion, hunger, and thirst. Since departing early Saturday morning last week, he spent a total of 186 hours and 50 minutes, circling the globe, reducing the previous round-the-world record by another 20 hours and 26 minutes. When the "Winnie Mae" aircraft, equipped with an automatic pilot, appeared at the airfield, tens of thousands of people cheered. Mrs. Post was overjoyed and wept in front of the office. His old friend Gatty, who had accompanied him on the round-the-world flight two years ago, was particularly excited. Perhaps the only one slightly disappointed in the entire crowd was Post himself, as he had hoped to reduce his world record by at least three days. Unfortunately, he suffered two mechanical failures en route, and encountered repeated wind, rain, and dense fog, which repeatedly delayed him. Even with tireless, day-and-night travel, he was only able to reduce the record by 20 hours and 26 minutes. Nevertheless, precisely because of these various obstacles, his success appears all the more impressive. Even before Post arrived, tens of thousands of congratulatory telegrams arrived in New York, as the senders were confident that his aviation talent and skills would enable him to complete the entire journey. After disembarking, Post responded to the countless congratulations with only, "I am extremely tired. This was indeed a long and difficult journey." He was then escorted to a hotel by his close friends to rest, and people were asked not to disturb him. He had departed from Fairbanks at 7:43 pm last night and arrived in Edmonton, Canada, at 9:13 am this morning. After refueling, he departed at 10:41 am and safely arrived at the airfield here at 11:49 pm. He had not rested for a single moment during the entire day and night. After he departed from Edmonton, people here began preparing for a grand welcome. Those who did not go to the airfield also went to rooftops or open spaces to look up at the plane. The airfield had all its lights on for two hours, shining as brightly as daylight. Loudspeakers also constantly reported news of Post's progress along the way. When he safely landed in the field and drove to the front of the office, countless young aviators wanted to rush to the plane and parade Post around the field. The police worked hard to suppress them before they could be stopped. Post waited in the plane for a few minutes until the police restored order before disembarking, which shows the enthusiasm of the people of New York's welcome.</p>
<h3>Process of Resolving the Reorganization of Puppet Troops</h3>
<p>Last Negotiation and Debate Exceeded Three Hours</p>
<p>Additional Dismissal Fees Added to Reorganization Fees</p>
<p>Puppet Army Generals All Become Reorganization Committee Members</p>
<p>Preparations for the Through Traffic of the Tangyu Section of the Beining Railway</p>
<p>Resolution of Shi Yousan's Troops Also Progresses Smoothly</p>
<p>A special dispatch from Tianjin: According to sources in the transportation sector, the issue of reorganizing the puppet troops has been largely resolved as of 5:00 pm yesterday (19th). The details still need to be negotiated. This general resolution has been difficult to achieve. Lei Shourong and Li Zeyi went to Tangshan on the early train on the 19th, accompanied by Colonel Shibayama, a military attache from the Japanese Embassy, intending to use Japanese influence to put some pressure on Li Jichun and make him more easily compliant. They arrived in Tangshan at 1:30 pm that afternoon, went directly to Jiaotong University, and telegraphed Xue Zhiheng and Colonel Kita to the scene for an open negotiation with Li. Unexpectedly, the remarks of Kita and Shibayama sided with Li in every way, causing Li's attitude to become arrogant. The atmosphere was extremely tense at this time. Later, Xue Zhiheng and others persuaded Li not to be too insistent and to consider both sides, making sure that both sides could get by. If he insisted stubbornly and did not concede, then the resolution of the Dalian conference, which was scheduled to conclude by the end of this month, would be overturned, and we could not be responsible for that. Today, our side's compromising approach is already the best we can do. If we still cannot understand each other, then there is only a break and no more discussion. As a result, the two sides argued for a long time, and Kita and Shibayama mediated, proposing a compromise: 1) Reorganization fee: 240,000 yuan; 2) Settlement fee: 300,000 yuan; 3) Military advance: 150,000 yuan; 4) Reorganization of 4,000 police officers, with a month's salary of 48,000 yuan; 5) Dismissal fee for 6,000 people: 21,000 yuan, totaling 759,000 yuan. Xue Lei and others refused again, and after several debates, lasting a total of three hours, a final decision was reached: 1) Reorganization fee: 140,000 yuan; 2) Settlement fee: 200,000 yuan; 3) Military advance: 75,000 yuan; 4) This month's police salary: 48,000 yuan; 5) Dismissal fee: 21,000 yuan, totaling 484,000 yuan. Provincial Chairman Yu Xuezhong believed that Li's title of commander of the war zone's military reorganization was inappropriate. The Beiping Military Commission and the Political Reorganization Committee also felt that the word "commander" implied a specially appointed official. If the central government appointed a rebel as a specially appointed official, it would be improper. Li did not accept the previously proposed title of "Director of the War Zone Military Reorganization Committee." Now, a compromise title has been decided between these two titles: "Director of the War Zone Military Reorganization Committee." Under the director, there will naturally be several committee members. All the generals who are being reorganized can be changed to committee members, so that they will not be disappointed. As a result, Li also expressed his agreement. In the future, the director's office will be established in Tangshan, with monthly expenses of 8,000 yuan, which has not yet been finalized. As soon as the funds and clothing are allocated, reorganization will begin. Li Zeyi and Shibayama arrived in Tianjin by special train at 9:00 pm last night to report the progress to Yu Xuezhong. The original plan was for the Beining Railway Bureau to raise 200,000 yuan and the Political Reorganization Committee to raise 100,000 yuan. Now, because the funds have increased, the plan has been changed so that the Beining Railway will raise 300,000 yuan and the Political Reorganization Committee will raise 200,000 yuan. The provincial government will be responsible for the clothing and police salaries. Li Zeyi and Qian Zongze went from Tianjin to Peiping at 9:30 am this morning to report the progress to Huang Fu and He Yingqin. According to the reorganization of 4,000 puppet troops, there is actually not much elimination. The aforementioned reorganization fee of 140,000 yuan includes the reorganization and dismissal. The dismissal fee specifically mentioned in item five is just for show, and everyone will share the money in items two and three. It is still unknown how Zheng Yanhou, the former enemy commander of the puppet army, will be settled.</p>
<p>The puppet troops who were monitoring the Tangshan Telegraph Bureau withdrew at 8:00 pm last night and immediately resumed work, sending and receiving telegrams. The long-distance telephone line directly under the jurisdiction of the Tianjin Telephone Bureau has been repaired by employees dispatched by the Engineering Department and the Exchange Department from Lutai to Qinhuangdao and should be able to be connected soon. Regarding Shi Yousan's forces, Han Fuju has declined to accept the reorganization, and Huang Fu has sent Liu Shisun to Qinhuangdao to negotiate. It is expected that about 1,000 people will be reorganized and stationed in Jixian. The reception of administrative personnel in various counties has been set for the 23rd. The Beining Railway is also actively preparing for the through traffic of the Tangyu section, hoping to achieve it within this month, especially the Kailuan Mining Bureau, which is eager for the opening of traffic. Since the Northeast Army retreated from Qinhuangdao, Kailuan coal could not be transported to Qinhuangdao for export. On June 2, after the puppet Fengshan Railway temporarily opened the Tangyu section to traffic, Japan, in order to promote the sale of Fushun coal, did not allow the puppet Fengshan Railway to transport Kailuan coal for export, resulting in the accumulation of over one million tons of coal in the five Kailuan mines. During the Lutai war, when the British in Kailuan heard the news of the Japanese victory, every family drank and sang happily. Chinese people did not understand their psychology. When the Japanese army crossed the Lutai River and suddenly banned the export of Kailuan coal, those who had been drinking and singing were now drinking and cursing. (July 20th) Further news: Regarding the issue of reorganizing the puppet troops, the amount reported in Tangshan was a total of 484,000 yuan, while the amount reported in Peiping and Tianjin was 348,000 yuan. The numbers are different and the difference is significant. When reporters inquired with relevant parties, they were told that the reorganization fee was 140,000 yuan, the settlement fee was 200,000 yuan, and the monthly expenses for the director's office of the reorganization committee were 8,000 yuan. This is the 348,000 yuan reported in Peiping and Tianjin. In addition to this amount, there was also a military advance reported in Tangshan. According to Yin Tong, the receiving committee member, this amount was approximately 140,000 to 150,000 yuan, which Li borrowed from various counties to distribute provisions and rewards to his troops. There is verifiable evidence and it is not fabricated. It is inappropriate that the national government is acknowledging and repaying loans borrowed to undermine the country and disrupt the locality. Regarding Li's title, Li initially requested to be the commander of the war zone military reorganization, which our side firmly refused. Then he requested to be the director of the reorganization committee, for a term of six months. The Beiping authorities believed that the purpose of accepting and reorganizing the troops was to restrain them to prevent them from disturbing the locality again. Therefore, they gave him the title of director of the reorganization committee, limited to two months, after which he would leave the troops. Although there is only a one-character difference between "reorganization" (編遣) and "training" (編練), the meanings are very different and cannot be confused. Therefore, the two committee members Xue and Lei were asked to negotiate with Li again. However, Li had already sent personnel to collect the funds. Our side will only allocate funds after all points of contention have been completely resolved. This was the situation before 3:00 pm on the 21st. At 8:00 pm that evening, Lei and Xue telegraphed from Tangshan, saying that Li no longer cared about "reorganization" or "training," and the length of the term was not an issue. Colonel Kita had returned to Changchun. They requested that the funds be allocated quickly so that reorganization could begin as soon as possible, to avoid any complications. Yin Tong immediately telegraphed Peiping for instructions. Huang Fu ordered the funds to be checked and remitted by the Bank of China in Tianjin. However, Qian Zongze had not returned to Peiping, and today (22nd) is Saturday, and the bank is closed in the afternoon. It was not possible to remit the funds in the morning and they will have to be delayed until the 24th. It is heard that the total amount of funds will still be as agreed in Tangshan. The director's office of the reorganization committee requested 48,000 yuan for six months, but if our side can pay it all at once, it can be completed in one month because Li is determined to make money, and even Zheng Yanhou opposes the reorganization, also for the purpose of money. The truth of the matter has been explained in full by Lei Shourong who passed through Tianjin to Peiping this morning, and it will probably be resolved smoothly.</p>
<p>On the Qinhuangdao front, the Peiping and Tianjin sides initially believed that Shi Yousan's troops would not be easy to resolve because Shi had far-reaching plans and was building up his power from the ground up. Little did they know that Shi's master was the Tianjin Japanese Garrison Headquarters. The garrison headquarters told him to end it, and he dared not disobey. (Li Jichun's master was the Kwantung Army Headquarters.) Shi received the suggestion from the garrison and went to Dalian, leaving his chief of staff, Mr. Hu, to take care of his troops. Our side sent the receiving committee member Liu Shisun to Qinhuangdao on the 18th to negotiate together with Ohashi, the staff officer of the garrison headquarters. Everything went very smoothly. Our side recognized 1,000 people. Starting today, the Beining Railway (some say the puppet Fengshan Railway will provide transportation) will provide cars to transport them to Tangshan, and then they will walk to Wangtian County to gather. The provincial government will temporarily be responsible for provisions. After Li's troops are reorganized and the reception of various counties is completed, personnel will be sent to inspect and reorganize them. The administrative power of Linyu County has also been negotiated by Committee Member Liu with the commander of the Japanese garrison in Shanhaiguan, Ochiai, and Liu Jinbiao, the puppet director of political affairs of Li's troops, and a satisfactory agreement has been reached. Liu telegraphed the provincial government yesterday, requesting that Linyu County Magistrate Yin Shousong be ordered to take over. Liu is scheduled to return to Peiping on the 25th to report back.</p>
<p>According to Yu Xuezhong, the chairman of Hebei Province, regarding the reception of administrative power in the war zone, I am determined not to reluctantly compromise. The receiving committee members, because the Japanese side had no problems, and the Dalian talks were over, urged me to send personnel to take over. At that time, puppet troops were stationed in various counties. I sent people to try to take over Jixian, Pinggu, Huairou, and other counties, but they were all rejected by the puppet troops. At that time, some local bullies came out to mediate, hoping to reach an agreement with the puppet troops on the conditions. I will never interfere. I intend to take over if I can, and if not, I will think of another way. If I force the takeover, all future affairs will be constrained. Li Jichun intends to recommend several county magistrates to be appointed by the provincial government in order to control political power. I had long expected that he would do this, so I had already appointed the county magistrates to prevent him from opening his mouth. A few days ago, Li's secretary-general Wen Jiji passed through Tianjin, and someone spoke on his behalf, hoping to take charge of Luanxian, but I also refused. In the war zone, such as Tongxian, Shunyi, Xianghe, Changping, Baodi, Sanhe, and other counties, because there are no Japanese or puppet troops, the county magistrates and public security chiefs have long since returned to their posts (not taken over). Now, there are two routes to be taken over, departing on the 24th. Those belonging to the eastern route, Ninghe Yuan Shibin, Fengrun Zhang Renli, Luanxian Zhang Jinchen, Leting Guan Qingyu, Changli Liang Wei, Funing Liu Xingpei, Lulong Chen Qishi, Qian'an Lu Qingchen, Linyu Yin Shousong, Dushan Ji Shenxing, will all gather in Tangshan and be guided in the takeover by Lei Shourong and Xue Zhiheng. Those belonging to the northern route, Huairou Xu Wenquan, Miyun Sun Shutang, Pinggu Li Xingzhuo, Jixian Sun Weishan, Zunhua Pei Jingxing, Xinglong Li Ying, will all gather in Peiping and be guided in the takeover by Tao Shangming. Each county magistrate will only bring a small number of security teams for their safety en route. However, both Xinglong County and the Dushan Administrative Bureau are located outside the Great Wall and may be difficult to take over. (July 22nd)</p>
<h3>Investigation of the Palace Museum Embezzlement Case Not Satisfactory</h3>
<p>Yi Peiji Will Return to Peiping to Handle the Turnover</p>
<p>Zhang Ji Moves Antiquities to Prosper Xi'an</p>
<p>Peiping Discovers Telegram from the President of the Supreme Court</p>
<p>A dispatch from Peiping: The embezzlement case at the Palace Museum, which has attracted national attention, has not yet yielded satisfactory results after an investigation by supervisory committee members Zhou Lisheng and Gao You Tang in Peiping. Yi Peiji, the former director of the Palace Museum, will return to Peiping from Shanghai soon to handle the handover matters. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Yi's Whereabouts</h3>
<p>Yi Peiji, the former director of the Palace Museum, has been residing in Shanghai for a long time. After the first batch of Palace Museum antiquities were transported to Shanghai, Yi went south to discuss ways to preserve the antiquities in the Beijing and Shanghai areas. Then, rumors spread that Li Zongtong, the secretary-general of the Palace Museum, was suspected of embezzlement. Upon hearing this, Li was extremely indignant. On the one hand, he voluntarily resigned from the position of secretary-general. At the same time, he drafted a letter of resignation on behalf of Yi Peiji, requesting approval to resign. The board of directors of the Palace Museum held a full board meeting at the Lishi Society in Nanjing on the 15th, approving the resignation of Director Yi Peiji, and appointing Ma Heng, the director and curator of antiquities, as acting director. The resignation of Chairman Li Yuying was also approved, and Zhang Renjie was publicly elected as chairman. The new acting director Ma Heng went to Shanghai immediately after the meeting to inspect the moths in the wooden boxes. According to sources in the secretariat of the Peiping Palace Museum, Yi Peiji will return to Peiping within a week to handle the handover matters and announce the truth of the rumored embezzlement case.</p>
<h3>Inside Story of the Case</h3>
<p>According to news from the Palace Museum, Central Committee member Zhang Ji has a close relationship with Li Yuying but has some misunderstandings with Yi Peiji. When Peiping and Tianjin were in danger, the antiquities of the Palace Museum were transported south. Zhang Ji advocated transporting all the antiquities to the northwest, but Song Ziwen, the acting president of the Executive Yuan at the time, opposed this approach. Zhang then suggested to Wang Zhaoming, the president of the Executive Yuan, in the name of the Western Capital Preparatory Committee, to move the texts of the Library and Archives departments of the Palace Museum to Xi'an. Wang has already telegraphed this suggestion to Peiping to seek opinions. As for Mrs. Cui Zhenhua, Zhang Ji's wife, accusing Yi Peiji, the former director of the Palace Museum, to the Supreme Court in Nanjing, she initially only pointed out the timing of the sale of antiquities, i.e., the illegality of selling antiquities on non-Sundays, believing that the valuations of antiquities sold on non-Sundays were unfair. Later, with the help of various parties, Zhou Lisheng and Gao You Tang came to Peiping to investigate the truth. At that time, the two supervisory committee members Zhou and Gao did not investigate the Palace Museum, but consulted with the Peiping District Court. Because a satisfactory result was not obtained, Gao You Tang plans to come to Peiping again at the beginning of next month to inspect. In fact, the emotional separation between Zhang and Yi was mostly caused by very small personnel matters.</p>
<h3>Wang Zhaoming's Telegram</h3>
<p>After Central Committee member Zhang Ji, in the name of the Western Capital Preparatory Committee, sent a letter to Wang Zhaoming, the president of the Executive Yuan, requesting to move the texts of the Library and Archives departments of the Palace Museum to Xi'an, Wang immediately telegraphed Peiping, instructing them to prepare an opinion and reply. The original telegram read, "To Director Yi of the Palace Museum, The Western Capital Preparatory Committee has requested to move the texts of the Library and Archives departments of the Palace Museum, as well as the Institute of History and Philology of the Academia Sinica, to Xi'an. It also suggests moving half of the national universities in Peiping to Xi'an to form a perfect university so that Xi'an can be developed into an important cultural center in a few years. This case was revised and submitted to the 114th meeting of the Executive Yuan, which decided that the parts concerning the Academia Sinica and the Palace Museum should first be telegraphed to solicit the opinions of the two institutions. The school matters should be handed over to the Ministry of Education for discussion and reply before review. In addition to sending separate telegrams and ordering them to be handed over, I hereby urgently telegraph the director to prepare an opinion and reply. Wang Zhaoming, President of the Executive Yuan."</p>
<h3>Zheng Lie's Original Telegram</h3>
<p>Zheng Lie, the president of the Supreme Court in Nanjing, telegraphed Zhu Yunsheng, the prosecutor in Peiping, asking him to investigate antiquities immediately, saying, "At Zhang's (Ji) request, witness Yin will go to the capital immediately. Expenses should be prepared in advance." This telegram was discovered by reporters somewhere and recorded as follows: "Zhu Yunsheng, Brother, No. 34 Chang'an Hotel, East Chang'an Street, good telegram, delay action. Check immediately if there are telegrams transporting antiquities. So that the Executive Yuan can be ordered not to stop transportation because of the case. Zhang asked Yin to come immediately. Expenses should be prepared in advance. Has Cheng been released on bail? Reply by telegram together. Lie, with seal."</p>
<h3>Opposition to Branch Museums</h3>
<p>Reporters interviewed Gao Xiao, an archaeologist at the Palace Museum, yesterday and the following was said: "This spring, when the Executive Yuan ordered the transportation of seven or eight tenths of the most valuable antiquities from the Palace Museum to the south, the public had two questions: 1) Are the antiquities to be mortgaged or auctioned? 2) If they are not mortgaged or auctioned, will they be returned to Peiping after North China is stabilized? The first concern has been dispelled. However, the antiquities have been gradually dispersed in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Xi'an. It is disappointing to hear. According to Director Wang, our country only has one museum, in Peiping, which is not appropriate. If there are several branches, if one place encounters war, it can be moved elsewhere. How many branches does the British Museum have? If the antiquities are returned to Peiping, will they be able to be moved elsewhere if North China encounters war again in the future? Beijing and Shanghai are near the sea, and there are many bandits in the western provinces. Are they more secure than Peiping? Suitable addresses in Beijing, Shanghai, and Xi'an must build new branches. Does the government have this sum of money? Even if this huge amount of money can be raised, should it be used for secondary matters?"</p>
<h3>Inspector Investigation</h3>
<p>Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, and former Supervisory Committee members Gao Youtang and Zhou Lisheng were dispatched to Peiping to investigate several major cases, including the case of Yi Peiji, the director of the Palace Museum, engaging in malfeasance. The investigation is mostly complete, but not yet entirely satisfactory. Gao and Zhou departed for Tianjin yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, will stay in Tianjin for one day, and then return to Beijing. Zhou will then proceed to Hubei Province for inspection, while Gao plans to come to Peiping at the beginning of next month and then proceed to various counties in Hebei Province for inspection. In a letter to a friend before his departure on the 19th, Gao wrote briefly, "My brother and Zhou Jun Lisheng set off from Peiping today, will stay in Tianjin for one day, and then go south to attend a meeting at the Control Yuan. After the meeting, Zhou Jun will go to Hubei for inspection. It is estimated that at the beginning of next month, I will begin to go to various counties for inspection." (20th)</p>
<h3>All Dikes Along the Yangtze River in Anhui Province Have Escaped Danger</h3>
<p>The Yangtze River Water Level Is Also Gradually Receding</p>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: Due to the recent surge in the Yangtze River water level, the dikes along the Yangtze River in Anhui Province were simultaneously in a state of emergency. The Department of Construction repeatedly telegraphed the various counties to make efforts in defense and ordered the county magistrates to personally supervise repairs on the dikes. It also appointed several committee members and engineering personnel to go to the various counties to be stationed on the dikes for inspection and supervision. It also assisted the various dikes with materials for emergency repairs. A general flood prevention committee was also established to make overall plans. Currently, the Yangtze River water level has gradually receded, and most of the dikes have escaped danger. For example, the breach in the Xia Dacheng Dike in Tongcheng County was closed and completed on the morning of the 15th of the month. The Bangji River Dike in Fanchang County has also been reinforced. The Ma and Hua River Dikes in Jing County have received funding and materials for active protection and have shown signs of turning from danger to safety. The Director of the Water Conservancy Engineering Office, Pei Yixiang, has been appointed as the chief engineer of the Ma and Hua River Dikes and is stationed on the dikes to handle protection projects. The protection of the Guangji and Hucheng Dikes near the provincial capital is relatively thorough. The dangerous section of the Huangsitan River Dike in Wuwei County has been strengthened and repaired and is now on a safe course. As for the various riverside dikes in Wangjiang County, the collapse of the Dongxing Dike lake dike has endangered the river dike, and the inner river lake dikes are also under pressure due to the backflow of the Yangtze River into the Huayang River. Funding and materials are being provided, and personnel are being dispatched to guide rescue efforts. The danger to the east lake dike of the Guangfeng Dike in Dongliu County has not decreased, and materials are being provided, and personnel are being dispatched to be stationed on the dikes for supervision and repair. As for the riverside dikes in Guichi, there are still some dangers. About sixty li of dangerous embankments on the Danyang Lake side of the Daguan Dike in Dangtu County also have several emergency spots. Funding has been allocated for emergency repairs, and the situation has gradually stabilized in recent days. The Department of Construction recently submitted a report on the flood prevention efforts in Anhui Province to the Executive Yuan, the Bandit Suppression Headquarters of the Three Provinces, and the Provincial Government.

<h3>Wuhu People's Self-Defense Donation</h3>
<p>Anti-Aircraft Guns Not Purchased</p>
<p>Requests for Allocation from All Sides</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Various sectors here, in light of the Japanese army's invasion of our national territory, previously had organizations such as the County Office and the Chamber of Commerce initiate the establishment of a People's Self-Defense Committee. Regardless of merchants or civilians, self-defense donations were collected from each household to purchase two anti-aircraft guns to prevent enemy aircraft from invading. At that time, the people were motivated by patriotic enthusiasm, and many were willing to donate. Those who could not afford it were threatened with announcements accusing them of undermining national policy if they refused to donate, and they had no choice but to pawn their belongings to comply. More than 34,000 yuan was collected successively. However, after the signing of the North China Truce Agreement, the people's morale suddenly declined, and no one mentioned the purchase of artillery. As for the disposal of the donation, people wanted to inquire about it, but it was difficult to do so. Until recently, it was learned that 24,671 yuan, one dime, and five cents remained, which was being kept by Zhou Mengwen and others. Recently, the Changjie Road Administration Committee, because the funds for reconstructing the Changjie road surface with stone slabs were insufficient, held a special meeting. It was decided that since the self-defense donation had been collected from merchants and civilians in the past, it should also be used for road administration now to avoid adding to the burden of road construction at a time when commerce is declining. Therefore, it was decided to request the allocation of a portion of the funds to subsidize road construction. Yesterday, the twenty-seven Baojia chiefs in the urban area also held a joint meeting because their office expenses were insufficient and various tasks could not be carried out. They decided to submit a petition to the County Office, requesting the allocation of some of the self-defense donation to provide relief, and appointed Hong Yuchun, Liu Yongzeng, Liu Hanzhong, Wang Fengxiang, and Yuan Jingzhai to be responsible for carrying out the request. It is still difficult to predict what will happen to the funds in the future. (20th)</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Letter From the Police Department of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway</p>
<p>To the Editor of Shen Bao:</p>
<p>We are writing in response to an article published in your newspaper today entitled "Carters at Songjiang Station Striked After Being Assaulted," which is completely untrue. We were shocked to read it. After investigation, it was found that the carters' strike was to demand rent reductions and had nothing to do with the station police. The facts are all there and can easily be verified. Furthermore, the station police of this section of the railway have always maintained order at the station, protected the safety of passengers, and handled matters with a peaceful attitude. There has never been any unprovoked assault. We believe that the report is based on inaccurate rumors. Since the reputation of the police is at stake, we are writing to request that you investigate and correct the article.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h3>Navy-Made Jiangque Plane to Fly to Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>Engine to be Modified After Arrival to Increase Speed</p>
<p>Shanghai Naval Headquarters Changed Welcoming Date After Receiving Telegram</p>
<p>Chen Wenlin, Director of the Xiamen Aviation Training Center of the Navy, is flying the self-made Jiangque airplane from Xiamen to Nanjing. He was originally scheduled to fly to Shanghai yesterday morning, but the Naval Headquarters received a telegram this morning stating that the fuselage was slightly damaged and that the flight to Shanghai has been rescheduled for this morning. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Circumnavigating the Country</h3>
<p>Chen Wenlin, Director of the Xiamen Aviation Training Center, to promote aviation awareness among the public and to showcase self-made airplanes, has been approved by the Navy to fly the Jiangque airplane on a long-distance flight around the country. Starting from Xiamen, passing through Fuzhou, Wenzhou, and other places, and arriving in Nanjing, he was originally scheduled to fly to Shanghai yesterday morning. The Jiang motor will be modified to 124 horsepower, originally 85 horsepower, to increase speed. After the modification is completed, he will fly from Shanghai to Bengbu, Xuzhou, Jinan, Tianjin, Beiping, and then return to Xiamen from Beiping, passing through Qingdao, Shanghai, and other places, to complete the plan of circumnavigating the country.</p>
<h3>Rescheduled Flight to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Navy Aircraft Manufacturing Office received a telegram from Chen Wenlin last night stating that the Jiangque plane was scheduled to fly from Nanjing to Shanghai on the morning of the 23rd and was expected to arrive at Longhua Airfield at 10:30 AM. Director Zeng Yijing went to the airfield yesterday morning at 10:00 AM to welcome him, and the Navy Guard Battalion dispatched a platoon of soldiers to protect the site. At 10:30 AM, a temporary telephone report was received from the Naval Headquarters, informing that the Jiangque plane had been rescheduled to fly to Shanghai on the 24th. Director Zeng immediately announced at the airfield, "We have just received a telegram from Nanjing stating that the Jiangque plane will come to Shanghai tomorrow."</p>
<h3>Plane Damaged and Delayed in Beijing</h3>
<p>After arriving at the airfield, a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency went to the Navy Aircraft Manufacturing Office in Gaochang Temple to inquire about the truth. It was learned that the Shanghai Naval Headquarters had received a telegram from Chen Wenlin in Nanjing stating that the Jiangque plane had suffered minor engine damage in Beijing. Although there was no major damage, repairs were being rushed. However, due to strong winds along the river, it was decided to reschedule the flight to Shanghai for the 24th. It is planned to modify the engine after arriving in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Replacement of the Tianchu Plane Still Not Resolved</h3>
<p>Tianchu Factory to Send Another Letter Urging</p>
<p>The full-metal Junkers C-style fighter plane donated to the government by Wu Yun Chu, owner of the Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory in this city, was shipped from Germany earlier this month and transported to Hongqiao Airfield for assembly. It was scheduled to be formally test-flown on the 16th before delivery and naming, and a handover ceremony was to be held. However, on the 14th, Tianchu Factory received a notice from the Chan Cheon Foreign Firm, which sold the plane, stating that the Junkers C-style K47 all-metal fighter plane purchased by your factory had been crashed by the pilot during a preliminary test flight at Hongqiao Airfield. After receiving the report, the factory entrusted experts to conduct a detailed inspection. According to their report, the damage to the plane was extremely severe. It could not be repaired in a short period of time, and even if it were repaired, its efficiency would not be as good as that of a new plane. Wu Yun Chu, the owner of the factory, was concerned that an accident might occur during the formal flight in the future, and that since the plane had not been formally test-flown and delivered, the seller should be responsible for everything. Therefore, on the 17th, he sent a letter to the Chan Cheon Foreign Firm, detailing the inspection process and requesting that the German factory rush to ship a K47 plane identical to the original specifications to Shanghai for replacement within the shortest possible period. After receiving the letter, the Chan Cheon Foreign Firm sent someone to receive the letter, promising to ship the damaged plane back and then ship a new plane. However, Tianchu Factory requested that the new plane be shipped to replace the damaged plane. As a result, the two parties' opinions were not consistent, and the Chan Cheon Foreign Firm did not send a formal letter, causing the matter to be delayed for a week without being resolved. The Tianchu Factory, because the people of the city are paying close attention to the test flight of the plane, will send another letter to the Chan Cheon Foreign Firm urging them to ship the new plane as soon as possible to satisfy public expectations. According to Wu Yun Chu, the owner of the Tianchu Factory, the seller is responsible for the damage caused by the test flight, and a new plane should be replaced. The German side does not deny this, and the resolution of the issue is only a matter of time. Trade between China and Germany is frequent, and it is hoped that no negative impact will occur due to minor reasons.</p>
<h3>Italian Airplane Scheduled for Test Flight</h3>
<p>On the 25th, Italian pilot Kos will perform at Hongqiao Airport with the latest CR-30 fighter jet produced by the Italian Aviation Industries, which has the highest speed, flexible handling, and all kinds of military equipment. The plane has already been shipped from Italy to Shanghai and is parked at Hongqiao Airport. A public test flight will be held at Hongqiao Airport at 5:30 PM on the 25th, with a variety of amazing performances by famous Italian pilot Kos. Invitations have been sent to all sectors to attend.

<h3>Doron Legal Groups and Civilians Petition</h3>
<p>Please Quickly Move Troops to Attack Jehol</p>
<p>On the 18th of this month, various legal groups and the entire county's residents of Doron sent a telegram to the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Military Affairs Commission, the Beiping Military Branch, and the Political Affairs Consolidation Committee, stating that after the abandonment of the three northeastern provinces on September 18th, the Japanese invaders successively occupied Yuguan, captured Jehol, invaded Luodong, and then took the opportunity to advance westward. Our Doron was captured on May 1, 1933. Since then, the only important town in northern China and the "Little Shanghai" that the Mongols now call prosperous have fallen into the territory of the puppet state along with Liaoning and Jehol. Our people have also fallen into slavery to a foreign country. Dozens of people are humiliated and killed by the Japanese invaders every day. Alas, Heaven did not abandon the Qing dynasty. The Anti-Japanese Allied Army of the people suddenly emerged at this time. Commander-in-Chief Feng Yuxiang vowed to protect Chahar Province and recover lost territories upon taking office. At first, it was worried that his strength would not be sufficient to achieve his ambition. However, the army to restore the land was as swift as a galloping horse. Within a month, it recovered Guyuan, Baochang, Kangbao, and other counties. Then, with its momentum of breaking through the bamboo, it recovered Doron. Although the rebel troops resisted stubbornly by relying on dangerous terrain, they entered and exited three times, and both sides suffered heavy casualties. Finally, on July 12, 1933, the Chinese Republic completely recovered Doron. On the day our army entered the city, the old and young cheered in unison, as if they had seen the light of day again and were freed from being slaves to a foreign country. The people have already tasted the pain of subjugation and are deeply afraid of being slaughtered again. Therefore, we do not dare to be presumptuous and report with tears of blood. We implore you to consider the overall situation of the country and the suffering of the people, and quickly move troops to attack Jehol, so that the killing will no longer affect our compatriots. The people will be fortunate, and the country will be fortunate. It is specially reported that the Doron Chamber of Commerce, the Education Association, the Self-Government Office, the Agricultural Local Relief Association, and all the residents of the county kowtow in unison.

<h3>Fang Zhenwu Asks for Assistance</h3>
<p>Hopes for More Assistance to Complete the Task</p>
<p>Yesterday, various civic groups in this port received a telegram from Fang Zhenwu, which read (abridged title): (14th) telegram received. Recovering lost territory is the duty of a soldier. Thank you for your congratulations. I will work harder to encourage my soldiers to continue fighting and live up to your expectations. However, the army is hungry and waiting for food, and the difficulties are exceptional. I hope that all fellow countrymen and patriotic groups will provide more assistance to complete the task. Looking south to the sea and sky, I am eagerly awaiting your help. I respectfully reply to thank you. Fang Zhenwu kowtows. (21st)</p>
<h3>Jehol Volunteer Army Leader Reports on Anti-Japanese Situation</h3>
<p>Li Haifeng Hosted the Press Yesterday</p>
<p>Going North Today to Continue Work</p>
<p>Li Haifeng and Wang Yunping, leaders of the Jehol National Anti-Japanese Army, came to Shanghai from Tianjin a few days ago and will soon return north to continue their anti-Japanese work. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, they specially hosted the press on the ninth floor of the YMCA of the Eight Immortals Bridge, where more than 30 reporters from various newspapers attended. The two gentlemen gave a speech on the battle progress and the current situation of the army, stating that it has been four months since the fall of Jehol. After the truce agreement, most of the Anti-Japanese Army of the Great Wall has been demobilized, and some of the volunteer army has also been reorganized. Compatriots in the rear may think that the anti-Japanese war in the front has calmed down, but they do not know that the people in the front are rising up to join the volunteer army and organize the volunteer army because they cannot bear the humiliation and oppression of the Japanese invaders and the exorbitant taxes levied by the traitors. Deng Tiemei, Wang Gefei, Huang Shouchong, Zhu Jiqing, Geng Jizhou, Meng Zhaoyan, and our troops (referring to Li and Wang themselves) are still fighting bloody battles with the Japanese invaders in the two provinces of Liaoning and Jehol. Since the fall of Jehol, they have lost contact with the rear for nearly four months. Given the importance of the connection between the front and the rear, they came south disguised as ordinary people last month to report the truth of what is happening in the front to their compatriots in the rear, hoping that their compatriots in the rear will maintain their past enthusiasm and spirit and provide long-term support to the truly anti-Japanese volunteer army. In short, as long as the national territory is not restored for one day and the nation is not free for one day, the work of those who devote themselves to the anti-Japanese war cannot be stopped for one day. Jehol is the only gateway to North China and is also our home. We vow to use our blood to fight to restore the land of Jehol. We also hope that our compatriots in the rear will supervise and assist us, and that our comrades from all walks of life will provide guidance to the truly anti-Japanese volunteer army in a timely manner. It is reported that Li and Wang are scheduled to go to Beijing today, transfer to the north, and continue their anti-Japanese work.</p>
<h3>Telegraphic Report of Sichuan Army's Bandit Suppression</h3>
<p>Liu Xiang Consults on Bandit Suppression Plan</p>
<p>Liu Wenhui Reported Retreating to Guizhou-Sichuan Border</p>
<p>Mr. Fan Chongshi, representative of Liu Xiang, the newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Sichuan bandit suppression forces, stationed in Shanghai, has received telegraphic reports from Sichuan for several consecutive days. Mr. Liu arrived safely in Chengdu at noon on the 20th and resided in the former General's Office. Chengdu's order is very good, and the people are reassured. Mr. Liu convened various generals in Chengdu on the 21st to consult on the bandit suppression plan. A general decision has been made, and a general offensive order will be issued as soon as Tian Songyao arrives in Chengdu. Mr. Liu specially dispatched Division Commander Wang to fly to Wanxian on the 23rd to proceed to the northern Sichuan front to command the bandit suppression military operations. The appointment order and seal of the Commander-in-Chief of the Sichuan bandit suppression forces were delivered to Chongqing on the 20th and immediately forwarded to Chengdu. Mr. Liu will take office in Chengdu upon receiving them. Deng Xihou, who was previously in Chengdu, received newspaper reporters, expressing that all generals of the 28th Army are willing to listen to Mr. Liu's command as an example of unification. Liu Wenhui is reported to have retreated to the border of Guizhou and Sichuan.</p>
<h3>Lu Zuofu, a Leading Figure in Sichuan's Business Community, Talks About the Sichuan Situation</h3>
<p>From Economic and Cultural Construction to the Bandit Suppression Plan for Sichuan</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Zuofu, a leading figure in Sichuan's business community, is the General Manager of the Minsheng Industrial Company of Sichuan and the founder of the Western China Science Society. He has spared no effort in developing culture and industry in the west. His success in his career is mainly due to his spirit of experimentation and creation. Mr. Lu recently came to Shanghai on business. A reporter from Shen Shi News Agency interviewed him at his residence to inquire about the current situation of industry and culture in Sichuan Province, as well as Mr. Lu's personal efforts in industry. The reporter also asked for his personal views and practical criticism of the current chaotic situation in Sichuan. Mr. Lu spoke in detail. The main points are summarized as follows: Mr. Lu first described the process of founding the Minsheng Industrial Company under difficult conditions, saying that since he attempted to proceed thirteen years ago, the result was terminated due to difficulties or political changes. He then decided to base himself on economic undertakings and founded the Minsheng Industrial Company. Initially, he raised a small amount of capital of eight thousand yuan and planned to operate small navigation ships between Chongqing and Hechuan. He then engaged in investigating the river conditions and the state of the shipping industry in Chongqing, and ordered the construction of a navigation ship worth twenty-four thousand five hundred taels. Next, he talked about running the Hechuan Electric Light Factory, and said that as of December last year, all the ships on the Sichuan River, except for the ships of the Sanbei and China Merchants Steam Navigation Companies, were almost all merged by the Minsheng Company. There are now twenty-three ships of various sizes, which have grasped the hub of navigation in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. The encroachment of foreign shipping industries can also be resisted invisibly. Next, he described the company's concurrent operation of the Beichuan Railway and Tianfu Coal Mine, which are related to transportation. In terms of cultural undertakings, the Western China Science Society in Beifu County is the center. The society focuses on the research of experimental and applied sciences, and has successively established five research institutes for geology, biology, agriculture, physics and chemistry, as well as a zoo, a botanical garden, a museum, and a library. The museum has collected and displayed more than 20,000 pieces, making it the only relatively complete academic research institution in the west. Under the guidance of the Western China Science Society, one primary school and one middle school have been established, focusing on training students' creativity and service skills. In the rural cultural undertakings near Beifu, there are: (1) the establishment of two parks, (2) a small library, (3) the establishment of a civilian education autonomy office to implement autonomous education and establish civilian autonomous schools, (4) the construction of a public entertainment venue, (5) the establishment of a public sports field, and a small-scale newspaper office is also run in the nearby villages. Mr. Lu finally talked about the Sichuan situation, roughly saying that with Sichuan Province's fertile land and abundant resources, if it can be actively developed, the future is unlimited. However, with years of civil war, the people are living in dire straits, and the rampant communists are the most serious crisis in the current Sichuan situation. The communist forces in Sichuan have spread to as many as nine counties, three of which are completely under their control, with about 30,000 firearms, and the number of people is difficult to estimate. If the generals in Sichuan can unite and cooperate to suppress them, the problem is not difficult to solve. However, the Sichuan situation has long been divided and mutually suspicious, resulting in armed conflict. The newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Sichuan bandit suppression forces, Liu Xiang, plans to have a bandit suppression plan for Sichuan. The people of Sichuan also long for the emergence of peace and unification in the midst of hardship. I believe that this is the place where Sichuan Province is progressing. The Sichuan situation ten years ago was passive, and ten years later it is actively stabilizing the Sichuan situation. It is not without hope. However, I believe that the unification of the Sichuan situation lies in the use of new methods and strategies, and not in the conquest of military force alone. The continuation of the war for more than twenty years has not only failed to clarify the Sichuan situation in the slightest, but has also placed the Sichuan situation in an unbearable state. Therefore, the generals in Sichuan should realize that "war" is not credible. A stable situation succeeds in orderly construction, not in the destruction of order. I believe that to stabilize the Sichuan situation, (1) temporarily seek the unification of all parties' methods, (2) change the traditional zoning system to a division of labor and cooperation system, (3) entrust specialized undertakings to specialized talents, and concentrate the talents of the entire province in the provincial organs, (4) mutually transfer civil servants and transfer troops to eliminate mutual barriers and suspicion, in order to unify the defense area. In this way, we can expect to thoroughly stabilize the Sichuan situation. In short, the method of stabilizing Sichuan is in consolidation rather than war. Otherwise, believing in the omnipotence of war, even if there is a temporary peaceful situation, its inherent contradictions can never be resolved, which is only tantamount to treating the symptoms but not the root cause, and is not a long-term solution. Mr. Lu further said that the outside world knows that the civil war in Sichuan is complicated, but they pay little attention to the construction in various places, such as the construction of roads, which has reached 2,000 kilometers throughout the province. If it can be realized in the near future, then the progress in politics, society, economy, and culture will be rapid.</p>
<h3>Ma Zhanshan Went to Hangzhou Last Night</h3>
<p>Will Transfer to Mogan Mountain Today to Escape the Heat</p>
<p>Ma Expressed He Will Go to Jiangxi Again When Necessary</p>
<p>General Ma Zhanshan, accompanied by Zhang Dianjiu, Zhou Weitai, and others, took the night express train to Hangzhou last night and will transfer to Mogan Mountain to escape the heat. He is scheduled to stay in Mogan Mountain for two weeks before returning to Shanghai. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Leaving Shanghai for Hangzhou</h3>
<p>General Ma Zhanshan had long been in the Northeast and was accustomed to the cold climate. This time he came south and encountered the sweltering heat, and he felt quite unwell. There was a risk of fainting from time to time. He originally planned to leave Shanghai early and go to Mogan Mountain to escape the heat, but he could not do so until last night because there were still important matters to be completed. General Ma took the night express train to Hangzhou at 6:30 last night and arrived in Hangzhou at 10:44 that night. He is scheduled to take a car this morning and go directly to Mogan Mountain to escape the heat.</p>
<h3>Accompanying Personnel</h3>
<p>General Ma's departure from Shanghai this time was quite secret, so only a few of Ma's subordinates and reporters saw him off. Those who accompanied General Ma to Mogan Mountain included Zhang Dianjiu, Deputy Commander of the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese Salvation Army, Zhou Weitai, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs of Heilongjiang, Zhang Dianjiu's son, Jiqing, Ma's friend Wang Zichun, and eight people including his accompanying secretary and adjutant. Lang Guanpu, Acting Chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government, Secretary Ke Yin, and Wu Huanzhang and others all stayed in Shanghai to handle the aftermath.</p>
<h3>Ma's Conversation</h3>
<p>General Ma told a reporter from the Central News Agency in the car last night that he came south this time and encountered the sweltering heat, and he suffered from dizziness from time to time, so he planned to stay in Mogan Mountain for a while to escape the heat. He will spend the night in Hangzhou tonight (23rd) and will transfer to Mogan Mountain tomorrow morning (24th). He is scheduled to stay in Mogan Mountain for two weeks before returning to Shanghai. He previously sent Pu Bingshan as a representative to Jiangxi to visit Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and ask for instructions on everything. His future whereabouts must be decided after Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's instructions. As soon as Pu returns, he may go to Jiangxi to visit Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to discuss everything in person.</p>
<h3>Zhang Suffers from Boils</h3>
<p>Zhang Dianjiu, who accompanied General Ma to Mogan this time, has recently suffered from boils all over his neck due to the hot weather and rising fire. He sought medical treatment, but the effect was not very good, so he accompanied General Ma to Mogan Mountain for a short stay to recuperate.</p>
<h3>The Ministry Has Not Approved the Factory Inspection Method in the Concession</h3>
<p>The Signing of the Agreement is Not Accurate</p>
<p>Nanjing Electric News: Regarding the Shanghai factory inspection issue, the interim measures proposed by both parties have been submitted to the Ministry of Industry for review by the Shanghai Municipal Government. Whether the Ministry agrees and whether there are any revisions have not yet been decided. It is not accurate to say that the signing will take place on August 1st and the establishment on September 1st.</p>
<h3>Reform Measures for Levying Tax on Foreign Liquor</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Shanghai Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Collection Branch received instructions from the Jiangsu Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau yesterday, stating that after the order was revised, foreign liquors, except for alcohol, are exempt from collection. However, all foreign liquors produced domestically, regardless of whether they are manufactured by foreigners or imitated by Chinese, are still collected before the collection methods are formally ordered. However, foreign liquors that have already been taxed cannot be taxed again. It has been found that the tax on foreign liquors in Jiangsu Province has been concurrently collected by the twelve public sales branches of Shanghai, Baoshan, Songjiang, Qingpu, Changshu, Wuxian, Wuxi, Wujin, Zhenjiang, Jiangning, Jiangdu, and Tongshan. This year's fundamental reform will cancel all public sales branches. All taxes on foreign liquors should still be assigned to each branch to handle according to the old cases. The regulations are hereby issued and the branch director is ordered to comply with them.</p>
<h3>Young Students Prepare to Welcome the Barbusse Investigation Team</h3>
<p>The Barbusse Investigation Team of the World Anti-Imperialist War Resistance Association is about to arrive in Shanghai. It is reported that more than ten youth groups, including Shanghai youth students and theater groups, have initiated preparations to welcome them and named it the Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Youth Welcome Barbusse Investigation Team Delegation. A temporary office is located at No. 53, Yongqing Lane, Dagu Road, Xinzha. Individuals are welcome to participate. Yesterday (23rd) at 2:00 p.m., the Shanghai Youth Welcome Barbusse Investigation Team Delegation Congress was held. Many students and theater people attended and discussed the welcoming methods. Preparatory members were designated to be responsible for the preparations.</p>
<h3>Exposure of Old Objects from the Forbidden City</h3>
<p>The Supervisory Committee is Officially Established</p>
<p>The First Meeting is Scheduled to Open the Boxes on the 26th</p>
<p>The Forbidden City Museum has specially formed a temporary Supervisory Committee to expose the old objects in Shanghai, and representatives from various agencies are assigned as members. At 6:00 p.m. the night before, the committee was officially established at the Forbidden City's Shanghai Office in the Albert Apartments on Albert Road and held its first meeting. The representatives attending were Chen Xian, Counselor of the Executive Yuan, Huang Ren, Secretary of the Military Affairs Commission, Zhou Ren of the Academia Sinica, Liu Yunfang of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Ouyang Shu of the Shanghai Local Court, Yu Kui and Zhuang Shangyan of the Forbidden City Museum, and acting Director Ma Heng also attended.</p>

At 9:00 a.m. on that day, all supervisory committee members will go to the warehouse at No. 26, Tianzhutang Street to gather and supervise; (2) the inspection will be carried out in groups, with at least two representatives from each agency in each group, and at least three groups working together; (3) the Supervisory Committee will send a letter to each agency to request the addition of assistants, compile group numbers; (4) after the inspection, each box will be sealed by the Supervisory Committee to show prudence.</p>
<h3>The Citizens' Federation Inspects Enemy Goods</h3>
<p>Patriotic Associations and Anti-Japanese Associations from All Over the Country Have Sent Telegrams to Inquire</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation's Enemy Goods Inspection Committee sent investigation members to inspect the districts, it has found that enemy goods have been disguised and masquerading as domestic brands and sold in this city and other ports. The Committee has telegraphed all port agencies in the country about the situation of goods such as the Four Gentlemen brand being changed to pay close attention. It is now reported that patriotic anti-Japanese organizations from all over the country, such as the Patriotic Association in Yichang and other places, have sent telegrams to inquire and sent samples of detained goods and brands, requesting a review of the brands and proof before deciding on the sealing method. The Committee is currently engaged in investigation to prove everything. Telegrams from patriotic groups in other ports roughly stated that the telegram last month stated that Shanghai's Dingji Inn and Baosheng and other companies have all changed the trademarks of enemy goods, masquerading as domestic goods, and transported them to the interior. After verification, they were detained to warn unscrupulous merchants from following suit. They admire the determination of your association to maintain the anti-Japanese work and hate evil as much as possible. Our association dares to proceed in unison. After checking the goods arriving at the port, similar disguised goods have been detained and samples are sent for rapid proof to be handled. We hope to expose the black幕 of unscrupulous merchants at any time. It is important.</p>
<h3>Traces of People in the News</h3>
<p>Yu Youren took the Beijing-Shanghai train out of Beijing last night and arrived in Shanghai at 8:00 a.m. this morning. Gan Naiguang, Liu Weizhi, and Niu Yongjian took the Beijing-Shanghai train to Beijing last night.</p>

He was consulted in advance and Dai agreed before the announcement was made.

It is not accurate to say that Dai will not take up the new position.</p>
<h3>Various Shipping Companies Improve Anti-Theft Equipment on Ships</h3>
<p>The Navy Sends Ships to Cruise Near Bandit Dens and Notifies Water Police in Various Places to Assist in the Suppression. The Ministry of Communications, in view of the rampant piracy and the fact that commercial ships sailing on the ocean are often robbed, invited the Ministry of Interior, the Navy Department, the Customs Service, and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in Beijing to discuss anti-theft measures. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Send Ships to Suppress</h3>
<p>A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency specially visited Mr. Shen Jiyun of the Shipping Department of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to inquire about the meeting. It is said that during the meeting, it was decided that the Navy Department should first send warships to cruise the ocean near various famous bandit dens. The pirates often pretend to be passengers and mix in, and after launching, they force the crew to drive to the ocean near the bandit dens and start robbing. After arriving at the destination, they board the waiting pirate ship and leave. As for the detailed plan, it is being drafted.</p>
<h3>Anti-Theft Equipment</h3>
<p>The Navy Department has sent three warships, Haihu, Haiou, and Yisheng, to cruise the ocean off the coast of Zhejiang from Shanghai. At the same time, the water police in various places will also assist in suppressing pirates to ensure safe navigation. Various Chinese shipping companies in Shanghai have started to install anti-theft equipment on ships in the Yangtze River and the sea and have added wireless electricity, following the example of the British Taikoo Shipping Company. For example, iron doors are installed in places separating the crew and passengers to prevent pirates from forcing the crew to turn the ship around and report by electricity.</p>
<h3>Two National Goods Groups Are Responsible for Collecting Fine Domestic Goods and Transporting Them to Qingdao</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Citizens' Association for Promoting National Goods, and the China National Goods Maintenance Association, entrusted by the Weihaiwei Management Office, are responsible for collecting exhibits of fine national goods from all over Shanghai and leading national goods factories to participate in the first Weihaiwei National Goods Exhibition, in order to attract the attention of people in North China. There should be a large-scale organization to concentrate the power of national goods to save the country. Preparations have already begun and active solicitation is underway. The following are the decisions made by the preparatory committee organized by the three groups yesterday: (1) The opening is scheduled for August 5th, limited to two weeks; (2) Registration will be closed on the 25th of this month; (3) Loading will take place on the 28th; (4) All staff will depart on the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xinfeng Wheel on the 30th; (5) Only factories that have filled in the registration form and passed the review are allowed to participate; (6) Participating factories, if not produced by their own factory, will be refused to exhibit at the venue.</p>
<h3>Passengers in Distress on the Tunan Wheel Appeal</h3>
<p>Petitioning the Authorities to Find Ways to Provide Relief and Severely Punish the Shipowner for Neglecting Business After the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Tunan Wheel was sunk by the Changchun Maru, the crew members and workers in distress have received pensions, but no relief has been considered for the passengers. It is now reported that the passengers in distress on the ship, Zhuang Sulin, Qin Dingchen, Xia Si, Lu Xianglin, etc., although they were able to survive, have suffered considerable losses and are guests in other villages with no relatives to turn to. They have petitioned the shipping ticket industry association to appeal to the authorities to request relief. After the Tunan accident, the shipowner Jiang Changqing and the chief mate did not care about the aftermath and did not distribute lifebuoys and life jackets to the passengers. The ship sank about four or five minutes after the collision, and the rear cabin sank about ten minutes later. At the moment of the collision, the shipowner and the chief mate jumped into the speeding Changchun Maru, which was obviously neglecting business. They also petitioned the shipping administration authorities to severely punish them to ensure the safety of navigation.</p>
<h3>Conflict Between Staff and Workers at Yihe Rubber Factory</h3>
<p>Su Gongxuan, the manager of the Yihe Rubber Factory on Humin Nanze Road in Nanshi, has more than 400 male and female workers. Most of the internal staff are Su's relatives and old friends. The treatment is extremely harsh. Most of the workers are also Su's fellow villagers, so they all cry and swallow their voices. Yesterday morning, a worker named Zhu Youcai entered the factory to work at 7:00, but the factory did not give him work until 8:00. Zhu Youcai then went to the general affairs department to inquire, but they disagreed and were insulted by Su Laowu, Su Laoliu, and general affairs officer Li Hongyuan, who were the brothers of the factory manager. His face was bleeding non-stop and he was seriously injured. The worker Zhu Youcai compensated and personally went to the Manufacturing Bureau Road Police Station of the Second District to cry. The Second District Police Station, in addition to sending the worker Zhu Youcai to the hospital for treatment, also sent the police to detain a group of people including Su Laoliu at the Rubber Workers' Union in the First District. After receiving the report, the police station of the district was immediately informed and asked to transfer them to the Municipal Public Security Bureau and transfer them to the court for strict investigation.</p>

<p>Huang Bingheng Returns from Inspection</p>
<h3>Talking About Aviation Construction</h3>
<p>The aviation equipment of various countries is advancing by leaps and bounds. He will draft a detailed plan and contribute it to the central government for adoption. Huang Bingheng, the former director of the Aviation Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs, was ordered by the National Government and the Military Affairs Commission Chairman Chiang Kai-shek at the beginning of March this year to go abroad to inspect the British, French, Italian, and German industries in Europe. He returned to Shanghai a few days ago and will go to Beijing to report within a few days. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency visited Mr. Huang at his residence at 10:00 a.m. yesterday to ask about his impressions of this trip and how he will build domestic aviation in the future. He gave the following detailed account:</p>
<h3>Impressions of the Inspection in Europe</h3>
<p>Mr. Huang first said that he had been abroad since the beginning of this month and it had been four months. According to the original plan at that time, the expected inspection was one year, but because he heard news from the country in the middle of the trip, it was even more difficult, and people from various countries also said that the director of the aviation department who commanded the air force was not fighting in the country during the autumn of the country, but was leisurely inspecting abroad at this time, which was strange. Moreover, being abroad, he felt more deeply than in the country. Stimulated by this, he had to shorten the time and return to the country as soon as possible. However, this trip was very satisfactory because he was well received by various countries. When he first went abroad, he first went to Rome, Italy, for three weeks, and then to the three countries of Britain, France, and Germany. During this inspection period, he was busy all day long and had little leisure. From 8:00 a.m. until 8:00 p.m., he could rest. The focus of the inspection was on the administration, organization, technology, and efficiency of aviation, etc., as a reference for our country in the future. The air forces of various countries have made rapid progress, which is quite amazing. When various countries were in the European War, they regarded airplanes as only the eyes and ears of the navy and army. At that time, the flight distance was at most only a few hundred miles, and the bombs used were only 20 pounds. After the European War ended, various countries gradually improved airplanes and strived for perfection. They realized that their effectiveness could not only cross the sea, but also fly over high mountains. If assisted by a large number of bombs, their speed and destructive power would be far above warships and artillery. Therefore, all countries spared no effort to cooperate to compete for aviation construction. At that time, the number of countries was at most dozens, but now it has increased to thousands. Moreover, the power of airplanes is even more amazing. In the past, the journey was hundreds of miles, but now it can cross the Pacific Ocean. In the past, carrying bombs weighed at most 20 pounds, but now it can carry up to 8,000 pounds. This kind of combat weapon is much more different than the German artillery with seventy-two lives during the European War, which fired 150 or 160 miles to attack Paris. Therefore, in the future, when two countries go to war, within a few hours after the issuance of the Armistice of的美敦, the political, military, and economic centers of the enemy country can be destroyed. Therefore, all countries are now competing to expand the strength and equipment of their air forces in order to compete in the world. I believe that the destruction in the future war will be greater than before, and the time will be shorter than before. There will never be a long-term delay like the European War.</p>
<h3>Recent Status of Aviation in Various Countries</h3>
<p>As for the recent status of aviation construction in various countries, it is progressing every day. However, due to the different environments and terrain of various countries, each has its own advantages. For example, because the United Kingdom is an island country, its navy is famous all over the world, so its air force equipment is all on the ground and is more consolidated than any other country. Its government spends 17 million pounds of British gold on air force military expenses every year. There are about 700 airplanes in the British Aviation Department. Airplane manufacturing factories are all over the country. Those run by the people are subsidized by the government. When necessary, the government can order them to manufacture according to the sample and supply them to the government. There are also many aviation talents. France is a world-famous army country. The number of airplanes is now the crown of various countries. The people are equipped as if they have their own cars in our country. Italy has been vigorously promoted by Mussolini since he took office as the Minister of Aviation. Recently, there are thousands of regular troops. There are seven large factories in addition to the small ones, all under government control. Its flight speed is also the first in the world. Although Germany is now restricted by the Treaty of Versailles and cannot develop, the internal preparation is also amazing. Moreover, German machinery is superior to other countries. If there is an opportunity, it will be able to see its special performance.</p>
<h3>Plan to Contribute to the Central Government</h3>
<p>He continued, "The construction of the air force in various countries is like that, and our country has been invaded by Japan like this recently. Therefore, in the future, the whole country must quickly realize it and engage in aviation sports. If the recent aviation to save the country, it is a good phenomenon of promoting aviation. According to my opinion, with the breadth of our country's radius and the openness of the coast, we must have at least 1,700 regular aircraft to concentrate on training talents at the same time. The army of 2 million should be reduced to save the local security, and then improve the knowledge of the police to replace the local army, and then do our best to resist the enemy. As for the detailed plan, I will start drafting it so that I can contribute to the central government for adoption."</p>
<h3>Will Go to Beijing to Report Soon</h3>
<p>After Mr. Huang arrived in Shanghai, friends such as Lin Wojian visited him yesterday and heard that he will stay in Shanghai for three more days. As soon as his private affairs are completed, he will go to see Chairman Lin to report and transfer to Jiangxi to visit Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to report.</p>
<h3>Yao Xijun Returns North</h3>
<p>Yao Xijun, the commander of the third echelon of the second route of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, was sent to Shanghai by Wang Yanghao, the commander of the road, to ask for help from all parties. After successful contact, he was recalled to the north by the commander of the road. It is reported that Yao will temporarily end the procedures from all parties and go north soon.</p>
<p>More Than 60 City and County Rice Merchants Associations in Jiangsu Province</p>
<h3>Scheduled to Hold a Congress of Representatives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Ninghu City and County Rice Industry Association Federation is scheduled to convene rice merchants from 61 counties in Jiangsu Province in Shanghai on the 31st of this month to hold a congress of representatives. A letter has been sent to each county yesterday, asking them to send representatives to attend the meeting. The association has also submitted a request to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry to temporarily exempt the rice grain business tax to strengthen the foundation of the country due to the difficulties of Jiangsu merchants. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Scheduled General Meeting</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Ninghu City and County Rice Industry Association will hold a provincial representative assembly at 2:00 PM on the 31st of this month to discuss important rice industry proposals. Yesterday, the association separately notified the rice industry associations of Wuxi, Changshu, Kunshan, Wuxian, Danyang, Liyang, Dantu, Changzhou, Shanghai, and other cities and counties to send representatives to attend. All proposals must be submitted for review two days before the meeting to be included in the agenda.</p>
<h3>Petition for Exemption from Tax Rates</h3>
<p>The association's petition to the central government for exemption from the rice and grain business tax has been drafted and will be issued after being approved by the general assembly. The original text is excerpted below: To Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan, Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance, and Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry: This association, based on the reports from rice industry associations in various counties, states that our country has long been known as a land of agricultural products. Recently, it has suffered from repeated floods, droughts, and wars, leading to the impoverishment of the people and the distress of farmers and merchants. Last year, the grain harvest was fortunately abundant, and it was hoped that the people's difficulties could be slightly alleviated. However, due to the devastation caused by foreign rice, rice prices have plummeted, and the rural economy is on the verge of bankruptcy. Social finance has suddenly become stagnant, and if no remedies are planned, collapse is to be feared. Food is a necessity for people's livelihood. Zhejiang Province has never levied taxes on grain, and even the business tax is exempted. This is because it is well known that taxing food, although directly levied on merchants, is indirectly taken from farmers. Jiangsu Province, being under the same banner, is uniquely burdened. How can this be considered fair? Therefore, we specially request you to forward this telegram to the government, hoping that you will consider that the prosperity or decline of the grain industry is related to the governance of the country. We pray that the business tax will be temporarily exempted to leave a lifeline for farmers and merchants. According to Article 10 of the Central Business Tax Law, the original tooth tax, land tax, slaughter tax, and other taxes of various provinces and cities that should be abolished according to law, or are inherently prohibitive, can be converted into business taxes at the original tax rate. Our industry has already registered and paid the tooth tax, and should be classified as such. Why is it that tax authorities in various counties of Jiangsu Province, in addition to collecting the original tooth tax from the rice industry, are also imposing a heavy business tax? This is clearly a violation of central government regulations, adding to the burden of merchants. At a time when foreign rice and grain are competitively dumping their products, and domestic agricultural prices are falling daily, farmers and merchants are in distress and unable to maintain their livelihoods. Why should they be burdened further? Therefore, we specially telegraphically implore you to temporarily exempt the rice and grain business tax until foreign rice and grain dumping is addressed by the customs authorities, and before taxes are effectively levied. Even if taxes must be levied in the future, they should still be converted from the original tooth tax into business tax in accordance with Article 10 of the Central Business Tax Law, and no additional interpretations or burdens should be imposed on the rice industry. Relieving the distress of Jiangsu Province will solidify the foundation of the nation, and this would be a virtue. Zhao Zixin, Chairman of the Jiangsu Ninghu City and County Rice Industry Association Joint Association; Standing Committee members Qian Jingsheng, Chen Junyu, Zhu Zixiang, and Yan Xiaoquan, together kowtow.</p>
<p>City Chamber of Commerce Petitions for Approval</p>
<h3>Regulations for Registration of Partnership Stores</h3>
<p>Partners should report their capital stock to prevent commercial trickery. The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce submitted a report to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, stating that the association had previously found that there were no fixed practices for partnership stores in the city regarding whether they needed to go through the procedures of adding, changing, and reporting in newspapers when partners withdrew, which often led to disputes. After the 31st Standing Committee meeting, nine regulations for the registration of partnership withdrawal in stores were drafted and submitted to your bureau for record on March 30. However, no approval has been received for a long time, and a follow-up report was submitted on May 27, but no approval order has been received. Now, according to a letter from the association's Qianye Industry Association, "The 43rd Executive Committee meeting of your association proposed a case on properly ensuring credit lending. Most of the stores in China are partnerships except for companies. The way the trade lends money is mostly lending to this kind of partnership store. However, the names, number of shares, and capital of the partners in the partnership agreement are only clear to the partners themselves, and are kept secret from outsiders. Even if they are obtained through inquiries and credit investigations, there is no legal basis to obtain legal proof. If there is a liquidation or bankruptcy, we will know that the inside story is not all true. We can only blame ourselves for the untrue investigation and the loss is not easy to recover. Therefore, I personally believe that this matter has a major relationship with the financial industry and should be remedied. After detailed discussion, we believe that stores should list the total amount of capital, whether it is a sole proprietorship or a partnership, and clearly list the names and origins of the shareholders and the number of shares they hold. The report shall be submitted to the industry association and the City Chamber of Commerce, and reported to the competent authorities for registration. If there is a change in the organization and partners, the registration should be re-registered and announced at any time. In this way, the door to speculation and fraud can be blocked, and the evil of false advertising can be eliminated. If it is a legitimate business store, and the shareholders are solid, it can absorb funds to develop its business. Or those who intend to use other people's funds to operate unreliable businesses will inevitably disappear and will not cause trouble to society. And our industry's lending business is also easy to choose, and the risk can be reduced. After unanimous deliberation, we sent a letter to your association for review and approval, and requested that the competent authorities approve the record for implementation, which is really convenient for the public." Based on this, the public registration of partnership withdrawal is sufficient to avoid commercial trickery and has become the unanimous desire of the city's merchants. It is reasonable to continue to report the situation after investigation. We hope that your bureau will review and approve it, and immediately issue instructions so that there will be rules to follow, which is really convenient for the public. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Alternate Executive and Supervisory Committee Members</p>
<h3>Re-election Should Be Held According to the Judicial Yuan's Interpretation</h3>
<p>The validity of the lottery time is determined.</p>
<p>The Executive Committee of the City Party Department issued an order to the City Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating that it was an order to inform the matter. According to the Central People's Movement Guidance Committee Letter No. 4122, "According to your letter from the City Chamber of Commerce, please instruct on the doubts about the election of alternate executive and supervisory committee members according to the interpretation of the Judicial Yuan. Please check and reply." Approved. The validity of the first lottery election of alternate executive and supervisory committee members of the City Chamber of Commerce should be determined according to the above-mentioned interpretation of the Judicial Yuan, that is, the first lottery time of the City Chamber of Commerce. If it is before the determination of the above-mentioned interpretation of the Judicial Yuan, that is, before receiving this association's notice on the above-mentioned interpretation, the lottery re-election of half of the alternate executive and supervisory committee members should be considered valid, otherwise it will be invalid. Furthermore, the setting up of alternate executive and supervisory committee members is to fill the vacancies of the executive and supervisory committee members during the entire term. If the entire term has ended, it should be re-elected together with the executive and supervisory committee members. The approved letter is hereby replied to. Please check and instruct to comply. Approved. According to the previous case, the association requested an explanation, and it has been forwarded and ordered to reply. Now, according to the previous case, an order is issued to notify the association.</p>
<p>Rural Reconstruction Committee</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Investigation Team Passes Through Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Rural Investigation Team of the Rural Reconstruction Committee of the Executive Yuan arrived in Shanghai yesterday after transferring from Pi County to Nanjing. According to the head of the team, Zhang Shishi, the first phase of the Rural Reconstruction Committee's rural investigation plan stipulated that four investigation teams be established in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Henan, and Shaanxi provinces, and they have already set off separately. The team arrived in Pizhou County in northern Jiangsu on July 1 to conduct an investigation. However, Pizhou County is barren and the people are poor, and there are many bandits. The rural economy is completely bankrupt. More than 10,000 hectares of farmland are mostly owned by a small number of large landlords. Self-cultivating farmers own very little land exceeding one hectare, and generally only four or five mu. There are many tenant farmers, accounting for more than 70% of the county's farmers. In addition, due to the siltation of the river channel, there are often floods and droughts, which cannot be defended against. Therefore, the suffering of the farmers is beyond words. The detailed investigation has now been submitted to the committee for review. The team will transfer to Qidong County and other counties for investigation in the next few days.</p>

<h3>Preparing to Move to New Location</h3>
<p>Organizing a relocation committee to carry out preparations</p>
<p>The reconstruction of the new headquarters will be completed within the year.</p>
<p>The City Public Security Bureau previously purchased 18 mu of the original site of the former Shanghai County Office because the original building was not suitable for use, and it planned to rebuild it for use as the new headquarters. In order to actively handle the relocation matters, the bureau established a relocation committee to handle all engineering land purchase and transportation matters. Li Mu, the secretary, was appointed as the chairman of the committee, and meetings were held once a week. The City Government has repeatedly instructed the bureau to expedite the start of construction and reconstruction, and plans to move in for office work one month before the City Government moves to the new location in the city center next spring. The bureau is currently preparing for the relocation and is quite busy. The new headquarters of the bureau covers an area of 18 mu. It is now planned to renovate the original building and hire experts to estimate the cost of construction. Once the survey is completed and the house plan is prepared, construction can begin. It is expected to be completed in February and will be ready for use within the year. All expenses will be covered by the proceeds from the sale of the old site.</p>
<h3>Xu Shiying Will Continue Leave</h3>
<p>Insomnia has not improved.</p>
<p>Xu Shiying, chairman of the Relief Committee, previously requested and was granted a one-month leave of absence to recuperate in Lushan due to insomnia. Later, because the illness did not subside, he extended the leave for another month. The vacation is now about to expire. According to his close friend, who spoke to the Shenshi News reporter yesterday, Mr. Xu's illness has not yet recovered and he will need to continue to ask for leave.</p>
<h3>Opening Up Transportation in the New City Center Area</h3>
<p>Setting driving times and ticket prices</p>
<p>The City Government's new building and temporary buildings of various bureaus in the city center area will be completed by the end of next month, and it has been decided to move in on New Year's Day next year. The problem of water and electricity supply after the relocation has been satisfactorily resolved. Regarding transportation, the Municipal Public Works Bureau has drafted a plan and submitted it to the City Government for review. The first step of the plan is to open public buses. The route is set from the new City Government building, through Xiangyin Road, Jiangwan Road, North Sichuan Road, and the Laobazi Road intersection. The driving time is from 7:00 am to 8:00 pm. The number of trips will be determined according to the needs of each time period. There will be at least six trips per hour, and at most twelve trips. There will be a total of 144 trips up and down per day. If there are special circumstances, temporary trips will be added. As for the ticket price, it has also been stipulated that the fare will be temporarily charged at 48 copper coins according to the fare ratio of various routes of the Chinese Public Bus.</p>
<p>Jiangzhe Fishery Joint Office</p>
<h3>Denies Contractor for Fishery Construction Fee</h3>
<p>The Jiangzhe Fishery Industry Association's Shanghai Joint Office fully supports the central government's principle of taking fishery construction fees from the fishery industry and using them for the fishery industry. However, the collection method exceeds the prescribed scope, and fish firms are responsible for collecting the fees on behalf of the government according to the price. There have been many petitions to deny this. According to a report in the newspaper a few days ago, Lin Kanghou told reporters from Xin Sheng News that he was mediating, and the best way is to change the fish firm to contract the fees. There is no other way. It is also heard that after several contacts, the opinions of both parties are gradually approaching, and the implementation can be resolved soon. For the sake of thoroughly clarifying the truth, a reporter from Xin Xin News specially visited the office yesterday. According to the main person in charge of the office, the office is jointly organized and managed by the Shanghai, Ningbo, Shaoxing, Taizhou, Wenzhou, Dinghai, Shipu, Xiaoshan, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Kunshan, Yu, Yancheng, and Zhenjiang Fresh and Saltwater Seafood, Pickled and Cured Goods Industry Associations. Regarding the fishery construction fee, the intentions of the various industry associations are the intentions, and it has been unanimously decided that the principle is supported, but the collection method is difficult to approve. A detailed report has been submitted, and eight methods have been drafted and submitted for adoption, but no reply has been received. As for the report that Lin Kanghou said that the fee will be contracted by the trade firms, it is also very inaccurate, and it is also impossible to realize in fact.</p>

<p>The number of thatched houses destroyed has also decreased by 282.</p>
<p>Shanghai is a place where Chinese and foreigners live together.

The attending committee members were Zhang Shijia, representative of the Wuxian Association, and Wang Weizhen and Shen Junru, representatives of the Shanghai Association. Due to the lack of a legal quorum of representatives, it was changed to a discussion meeting, and Dai Jixian recorded the minutes. The agreed-upon methods are recorded as follows: 1. The central government stipulates that the constitution research period will end on August 21 of this year, which is very short. If the meeting is convened again, it is feared that the legal number will still be difficult to achieve due to the hot weather and long distance. Now, a flexible method is proposed. The five chapters of the constitution draft, namely, Chapter 1 General Principles, Chapter 2 Nationality, Chapter 3 Civil Rights, Chapter 4 People's Livelihood, and Chapter 5 Guarantee of the Constitution, will be assigned to the five associations, each to study one chapter. In addition, the association's constitutional proposals in this session will also be sent to each association for study, limited to August 10 of this year. The research opinions will be sent to the Shanghai Lawyers Association by August 13 at 2:00 PM, and a meeting will be held at the Shanghai Lawyers Association to review and submit them to the association. 2. The Shanghai Lawyers Association is appointed to study Chapter 1 General Principles of the Constitution Draft, the Zhenjiang Lawyers Association to study Chapter 2 Nationality, the Hangzhou Lawyers Association to study Chapter 3 Civil Rights, the Wuxian Lawyers Association to study Chapter 4 People's Livelihood, and the Jiangning Lawyers Association to study Chapter 5 Guarantee of the Constitution. Each association will conduct its own research on the original text of the Constitution Draft. As for the association's constitutional proposals in this session, the Shanghai Lawyers Association will send them to the above-mentioned associations according to their nature. 3. A notice will be published in the newspaper to all lawyers associations across the country to express their opinions on the Constitution Draft as much as possible, and send the contents of their opinions to the above-mentioned associations (the associations responsible for the research) by August 5 of this year. The association will be responsible for the cost of publishing the notice, and the Shanghai Lawyers Association will temporarily advance the funds. 4. The above three methods will be notified by the Shanghai Lawyers Association to the three associations that did not attend today's meeting to seek their consent. If they agree, please proceed accordingly. If they do not agree, please notify the Shanghai Lawyers Association by fast letter on July 20 so that a meeting can be scheduled again.</p>
<h3>Adding Rooms to the Second Special Court</h3>
<p>Recently, the original court and the opposite office building of the Second Special District Local Court of the French Concession were not sufficient for use. There is still an open space on the west side of the court, in front of the detention center, which can be used for building a house. The president of the court, Ying Shi, reported to the Third Branch of the Higher Court for approval to build a tall bungalow on this open space. After the completion, it will be used as a waiting area for the parties and an office. In addition, the open space is adjacent to the General Patrol Room, with a partition wall in the middle. The patrol room has built a wooden shed next to the wall to store objects and place cars. Now, because the court is building a house, the Public Works Bureau is demolishing the wooden shed and the partition wall at the same time, and is also building a building for use. Both parties have drawn up the drawings and hired craftsmen to start construction, and it will be completed soon.</p>

<h3>Jiangyin Street Vendors Request Withdrawal of Order</h3>
<p>The Public Works Bureau replied to convene a preparatory committee for discussion</p>
<p>The merchants and vegetable vendors of Jiangyin Street were panicked because the construction of a vegetable market on the railway station road would hinder the commercial and vegetable vendors' livelihood. They jointly elected representatives to present their requests to the relevant government offices, requesting the withdrawal of the order to maintain their livelihoods and appease the people. Yesterday, they received the Public Works Bureau's reply No. 2484, which stated that the presenter, Du Jinmai, etc., submitted a case requesting the withdrawal of the approval for the Shanghai Charity Group to build a vegetable market on the railway station road. It is hereby notified that the case has been transferred to the Finance Bureau, and the preparatory committee for the construction of the vegetable market will be convened for discussion. After receiving the reply, the representatives decided to submit another request to the preparatory committee for the construction of the vegetable market, stating the reasons in detail, requesting a review, a quick change of plan, and the withdrawal of the order.</p>

<h3>Strict Prohibition of Hoodlums Snatching Flowers</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau issued Proclamation No. 17 yesterday, stating: "Regarding the matter of proclamation: The following is extracted from Instruction No. 6280 of the Municipal Government: 'Approved is the letter from the Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party, which states: "According to the petition from representatives such as Huang Yueyuan of the Shanghai Flower and Tree Trade Association, flower and tree traders are scattered in all directions, carrying flowers into the city, and are often completely robbed by hoodlums or arbitrarily have their gardens entered and plants broken off. Please forward a letter to the Municipal Government ordering the Public Security Bureau to issue a notice for protection in order to maintain business and warn against violence." Upon receipt, the original copy is enclosed for your reference and handling. The letter orders the Bureau to comply with the order and report back.' Therefore, the flower and tree traders are scattered in all directions, carrying flowers into the city for sale, which concerns the livelihood of farmers. How can unruly individuals be allowed to forcibly rob them on the way or even invade gardens and arbitrarily break off plants, causing direct harm to farmers and indirectly affecting local security? As ordered previously, in addition to reporting and ordering subordinates to comply and strictly prohibit such actions, it is necessary to issue a proclamation for public knowledge. All citizens of this city are requested to be fully aware that if unscrupulous individuals repeat the aforementioned actions, once discovered, they will be severely punished and no leniency will be shown. Be sure to comply with this proclamation.'"</p>
<h3>Wage Robbery at the Dachang Oil Factory</h3>
<p>丨Four Robbers Have Been Apprehended丨</p>
<p>The Dachang Oil Factory on the Suzhou Creek bank of Route Robison in western Shanghai, around noon on the 14th of this month, needed to distribute wages. The accountant, Ye Guoliang, and a clerk went to the Sanyangjing Bridge Dachang Company to collect 3,000 yuan in paper money, which was divided into three packages. Ye carried two packages, and the clerk carried one. As they were returning to the factory, passing through a long alley next to the Xihe Cotton Mill on Route Robison, they were suddenly blocked by three robbers, who took the 2,000 yuan carried by Ye and fled. A report was made to the Sixth District in charge, requesting the pursuit and arrest of the robbers. This has already been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that after the case occurred, Director Tan of the Sixth District considered the broad daylight robbery of a large sum of money to be extremely audacious. He issued a general order to all subordinates to apprehend the robbers within a specified period. Officer Gu of the Route Robison substation immediately engaged in a strict investigation. Yesterday, it was finally discovered that the ringleader of the robbery, Yang Qingyu, and his accomplices were hiding in a grass shed next to the Dachang Oil Factory (they were small workers at the factory). He immediately led officers to the address and apprehended the ringleader, Yang Qingyu (age 20, from Yancheng), along with accomplices Shao Bujia, Wu Xiaoerzi, and a woman named Jin Sunshi, a total of four people. They were all taken to the Sixth District for interrogation by the District Director, who confirmed their guilt. A document was prepared to transfer them to the Public Security Bureau for further interrogation.</p>

Upon receiving the news, the studio dispatched employee Wang Bokang, who found Zeng barely alive. Three empty medicine bottles of unknown names were left by the bed, with only one bottle containing half a bottle of medicine pills. When asked about the reason, he was unable to speak. He was immediately reported to the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station, who sent a car to the Renji Hospital for treatment. Afterwards, the police officer found a suicide note beside him, which briefly stated that his love for a Ms. Xu from Diyi was very strong. However, she suddenly rejected his marriage proposal a few days ago, and he felt that there was no point in living, so he took this action.

<p>###械鬥 Between Jiangbei Gangs</p>
<p>Each Holding Ironwood Sticks and Sharp Blades, Resulting in More Than Ten Injuries. Around 10 PM the night before last, Shao Dehai (age 36), a Yancheng native who pulls a rickshaw and lives at No. 157 Zhu Jia Wan, under the jurisdiction of the Tanziwan Substation of the Public Security Bureau in the fourth district of Zhabei, and others, had a dispute with fellow townsman Liu Bulong and others while joking on the road. They started fighting each other. After being dispersed by others, both sides remained angry and began to gather their gangs. In a short time, they each gathered more than a hundred people, each holding ironwood sticks, sharp blades, etc., and lined up to wait. Constable Tian Xiancheng, who was on duty there, saw that the situation was not good and immediately ran to report to the station, which sent police to arrest them. However, Shao and the others had already fought fiercely. When the police arrived, the crowd scattered and fled. In the end, more than ten people were arrested, including Shao Dehai, Shao Chenshan, Shao Changhai, Shao Zhixi, Liu Bulong, Dai Youzhuo, Deng Kuishan, Guo Changsheng, Tao Jinbiao, Li Jinbiao, and Shao Baochen. All of them had broken heads, were bleeding, were cut by knives, or were hit by ironwood sticks to varying degrees. After being taken to the station, they were immediately sent to the Fourth District Headquarters. Director Lai ordered them to be bandaged at the Pushen Hospital first. After questioning by District Officer Zheng Zuhan, Shao, Liu, and others all confessed that their quarreling had started from idle talk on the road. The interrogating officer, considering that the defendants should not have disturbed the peace in this way, ordered them to be sent to the Northern Judicial Section of the Public Security Bureau and escorted to the Shanghai District Court for interrogation. It is reported that someone was severely injured and may be in danger of death.</p>
<p>Ten-Year-Empty House Discovers Food</p>
<h3>Neither Fox Spirit Nor Ghost</h3>
<p>Someone Is Deliberately Creating Suspicion to Cheat Money. Five or Six Men Bowing and Worshiping With Ill Intent. 丨Police Declare Arrests of Sorcerers, Who Flee丨 Inside Pengjia Lane, outside Huatong Warehouse, Lan Ni Du, Pudong, a strange case recently occurred: food such as fried dumplings was found in a warehouse that had been empty for ten years. The details of this case were previously published in this newspaper. Ordinary people either referred to it as a fox spirit or suspected it to be a ghost, with much discussion and even talk of turning pale at the mention of it. In order to break this enigma, the reporter has been paying attention and investigating in many ways. According to the investigation, the so-called fox spirit or ghost is not the case. It is a pre-fabricated plot to try to extort money. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Fresh Red Apples and Fragrant Bananas</h3>
<p>The day the strange case occurred, it suddenly caused a commotion in the neighborhood, with many onlookers. It is said that a child selling pancakes and fried dough sticks saw a girl, about ten years old, wearing yellow cloth clothes, holding fried dumplings, seemingly about to enter the warehouse, and then suddenly disappeared. The child told everyone he met, and as more people knew, the rumors spread more and more. Some said that they often saw an old man with white hair around the warehouse a few days ago, or claimed to have seen two women walking out of the warehouse and jumping into the river, suddenly disappearing, etc. There was no consensus, but if you want to find the child selling pancakes, they have not been found to this day. However, the discovery of food in an empty warehouse is indeed a strange thing, and it is difficult to know the details. Therefore, once it was reported, the next day, more people came to watch, some even coming from afar, one after another from morning to night. Coincidentally, that day (i.e., the day before yesterday), a large number of fresh apples, red apples, bananas, and other fruits were successively found in the warehouse, and the onlookers became even more surprised and suspected, and the theory of fox spirits became even more prevalent.</p>
<h3>Gamblers Seeking Dreams</h3>
<p>In the area along the coast of Pudong, the gambling craze is particularly strong. Ordinary gamblers are obsessed with this, often making desperate bets with their hard-earned money. However, those who win are few and far between, but these people do not realize this. Some even have wishful thinking and sleep in the wilderness to seek dreams. Whenever someone commits suicide somewhere or a ghost is said to haunt somewhere, these people boldly go to burn incense and seek divination. Since the strange case spread to various places, that night, many people actually held incense candles, paper money, and other items and begged for clues to gambling schemes in front of the warehouse door. Or those who were familiar with Wu, the manager of the warehouse, even negotiated to open the door and enter to seek dreams. The ignorance of the people can be seen from this.</p>
<h3>Yellow Sand Thrown from the Air</h3>
<p>Around 8 PM the day before yesterday, there were still many people who were curious and went to watch around the warehouse. Unexpectedly, in this darkness, a lot of yellow sand was thrown from the top of the warehouse, continuously hitting the spectators. The timid ran away in fright, while the brave studied where the yellow sand came from. However, the top of the warehouse was very high, and it was difficult to know whether someone was lying in wait on it. Then they took the fallen yellow sand to the light to examine it, and they saw that it was all new sand, which had not been used. At this point, the audience became more convinced that it was undoubtedly thrown down by a fox spirit.</p>
<h3>Burning Incense and Lighting Candles to Welcome the Immortal</h3>
<p>Unexpectedly, not long after, five or six men came to the warehouse door, burned incense, lit candles, and knelt down in unison facing the door to pray, chanting words in their mouths. When asked, they did not answer and continued to chant. At that time, the Taikoo ferry boat had just returned from Puxi carrying passengers, and the passengers turned into the lane to go home. When they caught sight of this situation, they stopped and did not leave, firmly asking the reasons for their prayers. The five or six men did not answer for a long time. After being repeatedly questioned by the crowd, they finally said that they had just met the Bodhisattva, who had gone upstairs in the warehouse (the warehouse has two floors), and that they intended to welcome them back to set up an altar and worship them, to ask the immortals for people to inquire about illnesses, and so on. As they said this, more yellow sand was thrown down from the roof, and the praying people claimed that this was the manifestation of the great immortal. After receiving the report, the Third District learned that the so-called fox spirit haunting and food being found in the empty house were actually plots pre-fabricated by these sorcerers to deceive the public. These people deliberately welcomed the immortals home to provide people with immortal inquiries or seek lottery tickets, so that they could extort money. Their tactics cannot be said to be ingenious, but in this era of scientific enlightenment, this kind of sorcerer is not allowed to stand, and it is not allowed to deceive the people in society, and it is also prohibited by law. Many policemen were sent to arrest them. Hearing the news, they had all fled without a trace.</p>
<h3>Findings from Interviews Are As Follows</h3>
<p>After this scene of deception was exposed, those who were half-believing and half-doubting suddenly realized and made more careful guesses, and the inside story became clearer. It is said that the child selling pancakes, who first started the rumor by saying that they saw a ten-year-old girl, was actually paid by these people to say so, so that others would deeply believe it because their child would not spread rumors. The various pancakes, fried dough sticks, fried dumplings, rice wine cakes, fried cakes, etc., were continuously thrown into the warehouse, so after the rumors spread, when people opened the door to look, the foods were moldy, dry, and fresh in no particular order, deliberately showing people that the fox spirit had been in the warehouse for a long time. As for the yellow sand thrown down from the top of the warehouse at night, it was true that someone was pre-hidden on the top and thrown down to scare the audience. The reporter, not wanting to omit any details, made a special visit to Mr. Wu, who manages the warehouse, yesterday afternoon. According to Wu, the food that was first discovered was probably thrown in by others from the gaps in the windows. As for the fresh fruit discovered for the second time, it was he who personally put it in the warehouse because, according to others, if it was indeed a fox spirit, it should be offered fruit, and he was also driven by curiosity and tentatively tried it, but after one night, the fruit was still intact.</p>
<p>Former Newspaper Workers Often</p>
<h3>Ye Qiming Seriously Injured in Car Accident</h3>
<p>Ye Qiming (Shaoqing), former director of the mediation section of the Shanghai Trade Union Reorganization Committee, former preparatory member of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, and executive director of the Shanghai Press Trade Union, was riding his bicycle at the intersection of Henan Road and Beijing Road around 6:00 PM yesterday when he was suddenly hit by a car numbered 8214 (or 8274) in the concession and city number 260. Ye was seriously injured and was seen by two Chinese constables numbered 1733 and 2919, who quickly hired a car to send Ye to the Renji Hospital for treatment. They also recorded the number and reported it to the police chief for handling. It is reported that Ye's injuries are very serious, and even if he recovers, he may be disabled.</p>
<h3>Assassin of Gu Daosheng Brought to Justice</h3>
<p>Rival Zhang Jinbao Confesses the Details</p>
<p>A Suzhou telegram yesterday reported that Gu Daosheng, a native of the Shanghai arena, was holding a birthday celebration for his mother at the Daji Building in Xiaodongmen, French Concession, on March 26 of this year when he was assassinated by his rival, Zhang Jinbao, also known as Long-legged Jinbao, who delivered a gift. The assassin has now been captured by the Suzhou-Songjiang bandit suppression unit in Zhoujia Village, Qigeng Bridge, Changzhou, and brought to Suzhou. An officer will be sent from Shanghai tonight to take him back for trial and investigation. Zhang confessed that he was a 33-year-old Yixing native. After killing Gu, he first deposited two pistols in the Zhu Laoer brothel in the French Concession. Then, he borrowed 150 yuan for travel expenses from Zhu and took two prostitutes from Zhu's place to Xuzhou to sell them, using the money for expenses. He recently fled from Xuzhou to Changzhou, where he was captured.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit Involving Dispute Over Rental of Small Vessels by the Inland China Merchants Bureau</h3>
<p>Zhang Jingpei, shareholder and manager of the Inland China Merchants Steamship Bureau, and his shareholder, Zhang Jianfei, on behalf of the Bureau, signed a vessel rental contract with Zhuo Ruibo, Chen Tian, Fang Jianan, and others on July 18 of the previous year, renting three small vessels of the Bureau for navigation from Zhenjiang to Qingjiang, with a monthly rent of 650 yuan for a period of six months. The lessees delivered a receipt for 6,000 yuan deposited with the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department as collateral. However, the contract stated that when the lease expired in the future, the Inland China Merchants Bureau should collect the collateral from the Zhejiang Construction Department on behalf of the lessees and return it. When the term expired last year, the two sides settled the accounts. The lessee had to pay the lessor 1,237 yuan, 6 jiao, 3 fen, and 5 li, and the lessor should return 6,000 yuan in collateral and 1,000 yuan that the Bureau had already paid. Zhuo Ruibo and others were still owed 3,762 yuan, 3 jiao, 6 fen, and 5 li. Zhuo and others repeatedly demanded payment but were ignored. Therefore, they hired lawyers Yang Linzhi, Zhang Jiahui, Ye Shaoying, and others to sue the First Special District District Court, requesting a judgment to order the return of the money and interest. Judge Yang Fuxun interrogated them yesterday, and the defendant also hired a lawyer to defend them. After reviewing the case, Judge Yang ordered a rescheduling for further review.</p>
<h3>Mezzanine Collapses, Apprentice Injured</h3>
<p>Wang Fuzhao, 16 years old, is an apprentice at an electric light company on North Sichuan Road in Hongkou. He was sleeping on a mezzanine last night when, at 3:30 AM yesterday morning, the mezzanine suddenly collapsed. Fuzhao also fell from the mezzanine, severely injuring both feet and rendering him unable to move. The shop owner quickly reported to the Central Fire Brigade, who sent an ambulance to transport the injured person to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Fei Jinquan Is Becoming Increasingly Degenerate</p>
<h3>Wife Files for Divorce Due to Abandonment</h3>
<p>Fei Jinquan from Ningbo has always been unproductive. He married a woman with the surname Zhuang from his hometown in the past, living with his brother in a house left by his father near West Huade Road and Zhaofeng Road. The brothers even ate together, so even though he spent his days playing around, he didn't have to worry about warmth and hunger. In the spring of 1911, the Fei brothers separated. Fei's share of the inheritance was dissipated over the years and he was heavily in debt, and even selling all his property was not enough to pay off his debts. From then on, he lived by pawning items. His wife Zhuang's jewelry and clothes were gradually consigned to the pawnshop, but his bad habits remained unchanged. He was addicted to opium and enjoyed pursuing pleasure, using hotels and opium dens as his home. Before long, he became intimate with a woman surnamed Wu, and they now live together in Zun Deli, Xiamen Road, as if they were husband and wife, abandoning his wife Zhuang. The woman sighed that she had been unlucky in marriage and had no choice but to take her three daughters back to her mother's house, where they have been for three years. Every time she asked for living expenses, she never received a penny. The woman said that she would inevitably become a starving corpse with her daughters if she continued to be abandoned. Therefore, she hired lawyer Xu Shihao to file a petition with the First Special District District Court, requesting that Fei Jinquan be summoned for mediation in order to find a satisfactory solution. Unexpectedly, Fei repeatedly failed to appear, making it impossible to proceed. The woman then made a further request, filing a lawsuit against Fei for divorce. As for the issue of future alimony, she stated that she would seek redress in another case. Yesterday, Judge Yang Yi of the First Special Court opened the trial. The defendant still avoided appearing. Lawyer Hong immediately requested permission to proceed with a one-sided hearing, saying that the defendant had received a legal summons and was clearly intentionally defying the court. Judge Yang then questioned the plaintiff, who stated that she was 18 years old when she married the defendant, and it has now been 18 years. She got married in a self-owned house at that time. In February of the previous year, the defendant moved elsewhere after separating from his brother. In August of that year, he became intimate with a woman surnamed Wu from Hangzhou at the Dongfang Hotel and abandoned me. In March of last year, I had to take my three daughters back to my mother's house because all my pawnable items were gone. According to my nephew, the defendant and his concubine are indeed living in Daode Li, Xiamen Road. My reasons for requesting a divorce are: 1) the defendant smokes opium; 2) he has another woman; 3) he has abandoned me, etc. Lawyer Hong, based on the provisions of Article 1052 of the Civil Code, requested that the divorce be granted to protect human rights. The court then declared the debate closed and scheduled the judgment to be announced on the morning of July 25.</p>
<h3>Ah San Drowns, Tragically Dies</h3>
<p>丨Wang Wenbin's Debt Collection Resulted in This丨</p>
<p>A Jiangxi man named Wang Wenbin had an argument with his friend Ah San around 1:00 AM in front of the Er Bai Du Bridge on North Suzhou Road. After a while, Ah San jumped off the bridge into the river. A Chinese constable No. 11 nearby saw this and rushed forward to arrest Wang. He also tried to rescue Ah San, but he had already sunk without a trace. The police had no choice but to escort Wang to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that the defendant confessed at the police station that the person who jumped into the river was named Ah San. He had borrowed five yuan from him previously and was demanding repayment. They agreed to go to the Great World to find a friend to return the money. While passing the bridge, Ah San secretly jumped into the river. However, his statement is not entirely believable. Perhaps he pushed him into the river, or perhaps the demand for money was too excessive. The police have dispatched detectives to search for the body at the scene but have not found it yet. He requested that Wang be detained. The defendant was questioned, and his confession was similar to the one at the police station. Judge Xiao ordered him to be returned to custody and rescheduled the hearing for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Jin Family Mother-in-Law and Daughter-in-Law Settle Property Dispute</h3>
<p>The old woman Jin Chen, residing at the Jin family home on North Chengdu Road, and her youngest son, Jin Jilin, were previously sued for property division by the widowed daughter-in-law, Jin Ye, in the First Special District Court. The defendants also hired lawyer Shen Xingxia to defend them, arguing that although there were several properties, they were almost entirely mortgaged. Furthermore, if the plaintiff wanted to divide the properties, the children other than the plaintiff could not be excluded. The court instructed them to settle out of court, etc. This newspaper has learned that the disputed properties have been agreed upon for division by both parties. The plaintiff and her daughter, Jin Chengjin, will receive one-fourth of the properties, while the defendant mother and son and the other children will receive three-fourths. The settlement agreement mainly states that the plaintiff Jin Ye, Jin Cheng, Jin Jiu, and Jin Changchun will receive four pieces of property: the houses on Datong Road and Chengdu Road, the land at Hongqiao, and the public cemetery at Fanhuangdu. After deducting the 38,000 taels of silver and interest owed by Jin Changchun before his death to Zhang Weiyu, the remaining amount will be sold at market price. One-fourth of the remaining amount will be jointly inherited by the plaintiffs, and the remainder will be jointly inherited by the defendants Jin Lu, Jin Jilin, and the other children. Both parties acknowledge that there are no objections and that no further disputes will arise. The litigation costs will be borne by each party separately. Yesterday, both parties, accompanied by their respective lawyers, signed the settlement agreement in court, concluding the case.</p>
<h3>Two Nuns in Court Dispute</h3>
<p>丨Regarding the Confirmation of Abbess Position丨</p>
<p>The nun Zijian and her disciple Xiuchan are fighting over the position of abbess of Wanfu Nunnery on Datong Road. Zijian has filed a lawsuit accusing Xiuchan of seizing property and requesting confirmation of her abbess identity in the District Court. The hearing was held the day before yesterday by Judge Yao Fuxiang. The judge asked Zijian why she was suing Xiuchan. She replied, "He forcibly seized the property rights." The judge asked, "Whose disciple are you?" She replied, "Zhiko's." The judge asked, "And Jikong?" She replied, "I don't know his name. I've forgotten. I don't have any fellow disciples." The judge asked, "How old were you when you became a nun?" She replied, "It's been a hundred years." The judge asked, "When her master was alive, was he the abbot?" She replied, "Yes, there are two nunneries, Wannian and Wanfu." The judge asked, "Until when?" She replied, "Until 1926. My master gave me the nunnery. My master died in 1929, so my master gave me the nunnery before he died." The judge asked, "Is there any evidence?" She replied, "There is a will." The judge asked, "When did you take over?" She replied, "During the cold season." The judge asked, "When was the will written?" She replied, "Two years before I took over." The judge asked, "Have you always been the abbess?" She replied, "Yes." The judge asked, "Since you are, why are you suing him?" She replied, "He came in 1928 and seized my property." The judge asked, "Is he your disciple?" She replied, "No." The judge asked, "Why did you write 'rebellious disciple' on the lawsuit?" She replied, "He insisted on being my disciple." The judge asked, "How did he come?" She replied, "He came in 1928. My master took him in and fed him." The judge asked, "Whose disciple is he?" She replied, "I don't know." The judge asked, "Why did your master take him in?" She replied, "Monks are compassionate and accommodating." The judge asked, "Since you are the abbess, how could he seize the property?" She replied, "He changed the ordination certificate without permission and demanded rent." The judge said, "There is no such inexplicable thing in the world. There must be a reason. Ultimately, is it to confirm the abbess of Wanfu Nunnery or to return the property? You must explain." She replied, "Now I want to be the abbess, and this property was brought by my mother's family." The judge asked, "What exactly is this about?" She replied, "I want to sue him for being unfilial." The judge asked, "How can you be so confused? Let your lawyer answer on your behalf. You want to confirm the abbess?" The judge asked, "Is the will your proof of being the abbess?" She replied, "Yes." The judge asked, "How could your master make a will when she was still alive?" She replied, "Because there are two nunneries." The judge asked, "Do you want the Wannian Nunnery now?" She replied, "I don't want it." The judge asked, "Why don't you want it when Wannian Nunnery is on the will?" She replied, "I have already given it to Xiujing, who is also my disciple." The judge asked, "Why aren't the witnesses who signed the will here?" She replied, "Some have died, and some are ill." The judge asked, "You should bring the witnesses later." She replied, "Yes." At this point, the judge asked Xiuchan, "Whose disciple are you?" He replied, "Zijian's disciple." The judge asked, "Who is Jikong?" He replied, "He is Zhikong's Dharma name. It's the name for receiving the Dharma." The judge asked, "What is receiving the Dharma?" He replied, "After receiving the Dharma, one can become the abbot." The judge asked, "Were Wanfu and Wannian originally under Zhikong?" He replied, "Yes." The judge asked, "Zhikong had a will in 1924 and handed over Zijian to be the abbess in 1926. When did you go?" He replied, "I went on November 10, 1927. I received the Dharma on March 11, 1928, and the abbess was handed over to me on December 14. Zijian herself sent out invitations to guests." At this point, lawyer Shi Qinghua presented the Dharma scroll, saying it was from Mount Tiantai. At this point, the judge asked Zijian, "In this case, Xiuchan is your disciple?" She replied, "I don't have this disciple." The judge, seeing that her words were incoherent and that her answers did not match the questions, then asked Xiuchan, "Who wrote the Dharma scroll?" He replied, "It was certified by Abbot Jingbo of the Chinese Buddhist Association." The judge ordered that he also be summoned next time, while Zijian claimed that there was no handover of the abbess position to be proven. The judge then ordered the adjournment of the court and await further hearing.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor of Shen Bao,</p>
<p>I am writing in response to a news item published in your newspaper today about a principal and students fighting, which is untrue. Yesterday morning, I went to the college to work and was blocked from entering by three expelled students, including Shen Xuemeng, and several unidentified individuals who were shouting and disrupting order. The police took the three students to the French Concession Police Station. Chief Bordes sought my opinion on disciplinary action, but considering that the students were young and ignorant and were being used by others, I personally went to the police station to negotiate their release. I hope you will correct this.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Wu Qinggan, Acting Principal of Shanghai Business College</p>

<h3>A Bird's-Eye View of Shanghai's Medical and Pharmaceutical Scene in the Last Decade (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Pang Jingzhou</p>
<p>Chapter 5: Medical Administration, Section 3: Recent Government Orders. In 1929, the "Ministry of Health" was established, and various government orders were actively promoted. Minister Xue Dubi was naturally a political leader, and Vice Minister Liu Ruiheng was an expert who had worked in the Health Department of the Ministry of Interior under the Northern Government. However, in order to gather ideas and benefit from collective wisdom, they gathered medical and pharmaceutical leaders and organized the Central Health Committee. They held meetings in Nanjing for several days and decided on many outlines for health administration, including the regulation of new and old medicine. Among the members of the Central Health Committee, in addition to the government's ex officio members, several were key figures from the Shanghai Medical Association, the Chinese Medical Association, and the Pharmaceutical Association of the Republic of China. However, during the meetings at that time, they did not show prejudice towards Shanghai. They seriously considered the national situation and decided on two guidelines for physician registration: (1) New medical practitioners who had already practiced medicine with a county license before 1929 would be registered unconditionally; (2) Old medical practitioners who had already opened their practices before 1930 would be registered unconditionally (even students who were 20 years old could pre-register). As for the purpose at that time, it was naturally best that all doctors generated nationwide after 1930 should be graduates of schools. Even if it was truly necessary, perhaps a national examination could be held to select certain talents. Taking a step back, even if it was necessary to promote traditional Chinese medicine schools, to turn back the clock, and to promote apprenticeship-style old medicine, as long as the trend allowed, it would not be impossible to reorganize through a national order. And the above two restrictions, in any case, would not hinder the livelihood of current doctors and would at least lay some foundation for unified medical administration. (According to ordinary people, the age of starting a business can be over 60 years old. Assuming that the age of doctors at the time of registration in 1929 and 1930 was 25 years old, then the profession of these people could last for 35 years, which can be considered as thorough consideration and natural justice.) However, after this proposal was published, it caused a great uproar. First, the old doctors launched an attack from Shanghai, initially saying that this was destroying old medicine, and they united with old pharmacies to protest unanimously. The General Chamber of Commerce, for no apparent reason, also helped the traditional Chinese pharmacies by sending telegrams and issuing opinions. And Mr. Cangbo of the Times News Daily also wrote extensively, saying that the Health Department was inappropriate, as if a great disaster was imminent, the national essence was falling, and the people had no way to survive. In fact, judging from the purpose of the original proposal, what was so terrible about it? At that time, the country was in turmoil and there were many organizations. A group of new doctors who did not graduate from schools were afraid that if the government order was still brewing, an unfavorable strict policy would occur, so they took the opportunity to unite and organize a Western Medical Association to confront the Medical Association. They also wanted to participate in the Health Administration and Physician Regulations and express some opinions. Some people said that this action was still a reaction to the review of their diplomas last year. In other words, they were dissatisfied with the fact that those who did not have a school diploma could register unconditionally before 1929 in the Central Health Committee's proposal, and that those who did not have a diploma would have to continue to be generated in order to have another world. It's really strange! However, this starry sky of commotion resulted in the unrestricted registration of traditional Chinese medicine, and the Health Department almost had no examination power. At that time, it was very easy for anyone to obtain a certificate of traditional Chinese medicine. It is still like this today in 1933. On the one hand, for new doctors, the Ministry of Health did not follow the resolutions of the Central Health Committee. I don’t know how a Provisional Physician Regulations was produced. The articles were strict and complex, especially unsuitable for the national conditions. Non-school graduates were still outside the Sun Mountain. In fact, there were indeed such doctors, so how could they not be mentioned at all, and the Chinese Western Medical Association had to be declared established outside the law. I don't know whose old constitution was used to create the following deformed political views: (1) It seems that traditional Chinese medicine is being promoted as a national essence and being made wantonly; (2) For the new medical graduates of the school, they are almost considered to be foreign affairs personnel, foreign goods, and luxury goods, so the restrictions are stricter and the order is to make them into high-quality goods; (3) For the new medical practitioners who are not from schools, they are simply regarded as unseen. The result of this government order is the chaotic situation today.</p>
<h3>On the Importance of General Education in Medical Education</h3>
<p>— Ping Gong</p>
<p>The four major courses of medical school are anatomy, physiology, pathology, and treatment. And the foundation of these four subjects is based on physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, etc. Although the number of credits for basic sciences varies from country to country, even domestic education experts often disagree on this. However, everyone admits that it is a pre-medical course. I think that basic science is extremely important for medicine. But in addition to this, the foundation of general education cannot be ignored at first. A doctor's profession is to promote social health, directly and indirectly, and is related to the strength of the human race and the rise and fall of the nation. It is not like other technical personnel, who only need to be proficient in application. The first question to be solved is how to deal with people, people in society, both old and young, rich and poor, intelligent and foolish, virtuous and unworthy, and they cannot be measured equally and viewed equally. Even in terms of the social body itself, there are rural societies, urban societies, and metropolitan societies. In each level of society, when education has not yet been popularized and scientific knowledge is still lacking, it is full of superstition, ignorance, and prejudiced psychology, which always hinder the promotion of business. For example, in the case of malaria, most patients do not ask about the direct cause, but mistakenly believe that it is caused by a disease demon. They do not value diagnosis, but only worship Buddha and pray to God. It is not enough to talk about children, but people also say that reciting Du Ling's poems can drive away malaria, and reading Chen Lin's declaration can cure wind disease. Learning non-things has become a habit and cannot be investigated. If the practitioner sticks to his own scientific views and cannot explain it well, and wants to destroy and clear up what he believes in in a conversation, the result will inevitably lead to the failure of the goal and various difficulties will arise. For example, society always says that Western medicine is good at surgery but short at internal medicine, while traditional Chinese medicine is good at internal medicine but short at surgery. Their strengths are different, and their uses are different. This kind of thinking has penetrated into people's hearts. The reason for this is a lot of speculation, and the prejudice can affect everything. Doctors, if they have no research on medical principles and my country's inherent medical secrets, and want to defend it with a frank attitude and reckless tone, few will not be criticized and will go to a dead end. Furthermore, in recent years, proprietary medicines from various countries have competed to take China as the end of the canal. General patients are often confused by advertisements, thinking that if a certain medicine can cure headaches, A will be effective and B will be effective, and if a certain medicine can cure coughs, C will be effective and D will be effective. Filling up the classes is countless. Regardless of the source of the disease, they only know how to take medicine. How dangerous is this! Furthermore, there are many schools of doctors in our country. Patients think that a certain country is an advanced country in medicine and pharmacy, and that doctors who graduate from a certain school must have superior academics. I don’t know that medicine only has the distinction between science and non-science, and there is no distinction between Germany, France, England, the United States, Japan. Distinguishing the advantages and disadvantages of medicine with international boundaries is an anti-scientific psychology, which is everywhere. Doctors are in this complicated and complex environment. If they want to be successful in their business, they cannot only rely on medical knowledge such as anatomy and physiology. They must have sufficient common sense, considerable talent, and cultivation skills to be able to apply them. All of this depends on general education, such as classical Chinese, history, sociology, philosophy, and epistemology. If they are abandoned, the roots will be prosperous, the fruits will be abundant, and the response will be appropriate. In the past, there was a woman in my hometown who suffered from dystocia. She was accustomed to the old customs of the family and did not want to be sent to the hospital. At the critical moment, fortunately, there was a church hospital nearby. A Westerner, upon hearing of this, personally carried medical equipment to visit the patient. At that time, the family was observing the New Year's Eve, worshiping gods and burning silk. They were busy and confused, but the Westerner did not find it strange. He only asked for the delivery, regardless of anything else. As a result, both mother and son were safe. The family was grateful. Those who used to doubt Western medicine have now become loyal believers. If this doctor's knowledge and personality are superior, how can he achieve this? Recently, Mr. Walter H. Monsund of Baylor University in the United States conducted a survey. Among the medical students at that school, those who had received a Bachelor of Arts degree and were dismissed due to poor grades accounted for 9.6% and 17.28%, while there were no such cases for those with a Master's degree. It can be seen that general education is the foundation of medicine. Its importance is no less than basic sciences such as physics and chemistry. If you don't believe me, please use Mr. Mo's statistics to prove it again. According to Mr. Mo's statistics, the medical students at that school who had general grades of B (80 points) and medical grades that were insufficient to be dismissed accounted for 2.9%, C (70 points) accounted for 14.7%, and D (60 points) accounted for 22.5%. From these two statistics, it can be seen that the better the training in general education and the longer the years, the easier it is to study medicine. On the contrary, those with insufficient general education have more difficulty in studying medicine. The observation ability is broadened and shallow, and the adaptability is weakened. With the status of a scholar, he has degenerated into the flow of technicians. How can he not follow the criticism of Huo Zihang for being unlearned and unskilled? As the Western saying goes, a person with weak knowledge cannot find a match in the forest all day long. This is what it means. In general education, writing is the most important thing. If there is no writing in words, it will not go far. At the very least, you must be able to write fluently and be able to refer to books. In recent years, the medical schools in various countries around the world, with France being the most demanding, generally require students to have extremely pure vernacular when they reach university. Once they graduate from medical school, they can naturally use it with ease. Today, in addition to having a foundation in the national language, medical students in our country should also be proficient in at least one of the Western languages, such as English, French, and German. Because the important books and magazines in modern medicine are mostly published in these three languages, they cannot be browsed without learning. In addition, there is Japanese, which is deeply related to our country's medicine and cannot be ignored. As for history, sociology, philosophy, and epistemology, although they are not always related to medicine, they are used to train common sense, enlighten reason, cultivate temperament, and expand views. They are the main elements for doctors to enter the world. According to the Soviet educational principle, the first priority is the social consciousness and form. Therefore, before students study a major, their pre-medical courses emphasize both natural sciences and social sciences, so that students can have a considerable understanding of social consciousness first. This kind of planning and consideration can be said to be the true meaning of education. Today, human sentiments and world conditions are complicated. If there is no corresponding cultivation in general education, even if professional skills have been applied, there is little guarantee of how to apply them and how to make them effective. Those who are virtuous are in a dilemma and are exhausted in dealing with things. Those who are clever are good at scheming and only seek profit. Medicine itself and the health of the people are greatly affected. It is unimaginable that the drawbacks of ignoring general education have reached such a point. There are skills to perform business, but no talent to perform business. I hope that those who preside over medical education will not only create medical craftsmen with only skills.</p>

<h3>### The Scientific Way to Nurture Life</h3>
<p>— Yu Songyun</p>
<p>(Twenty-six)</p>
<p>(2) (10) (2) Breastfeeding Methods</p>
<p>(A) Breastfeeding Position</p>
<p>Both mother and child are very tired after childbirth and should have several hours of rest. Breastfeeding can be done after waking up. However, the secretion of breast milk is not very strong at first. If the baby cries for milk, sterile glucose water or maltose can be used temporarily instead.</p>
<p>When breastfeeding, if nursing from the right breast, it is advisable to take a right-side lying position. At the same time, the mother's elbow supports the upper body of the child, and the mother supports the child's head with her forearm. Then, use clean index and middle fingers to pinch the nipple and send it into the child's mouth. If nursing from the left breast, take a left-side lying position according to the law.</p>
<p>Within one week after the child is born, breastfeeding should be done in a side-lying position, because the weight of the uterus has not yet been reduced. If sitting up frequently, there is a risk of uterine prolapse. However, when breastfeeding in the side-lying position, the breast should be prevented from blocking the baby's nostrils, causing breathing difficulties and suffocation.</p>
<p>(B) Nipples and Fingers</p>
<p>The nipple is an important part of being sent directly into the child's mouth and should be kept very clean. It can be wiped clean with warm water or alcohol. It should also be wiped clean after breastfeeding. If it is not clean, it is not only easy to cause oral inflammation and gastrointestinal diseases in children, but also the areola of the breast is easily damaged. If bacteria enter, mastitis may occur.</p>
<p>(C) Breastfeeding Time</p>
<p>There is no need to breastfeed the newborn within the first day after birth in order to rest. If crying as if wanting milk, you can first give a</p>
<p>little tea or sugar water.</p>
<p>Breast milk must go through one and a half or two hours in the child's stomach to digest. Therefore, the interval between breastfeeding must be more than two and a half hours. After four or five months, because the amount of sucking increases, breastfeeding should be done every three hours. Breastfeeding can be done once every four or five hours at night.</p>
<p>For healthy breastfed babies, the duration of breastfeeding does not need to be strictly fixed. Generally, it is until they are full and fall asleep.</p>
<p>The usual time required can be distinguished according to the secretion status and the strength of the sucking force. It is usually fifteen to twenty minutes. However, most children can take most of the milk in five minutes. Moreover, because the breast milk is full and overflowing, they can be full in one or two minutes, so it cannot be generalized. According to old Chinese customs, children are breastfed whenever they cry, mistakenly believing that breast milk contains the effect of stopping crying, resulting in too much milk in the child's stomach, which is not easy to digest. Gastrointestinal damage can cause diarrhea and vomiting, and even gastric disorders, which can be dangerous. How can one not be careful?</p>
<p>The amount of breastfeeding for newborns is very small within ten days after birth, because the capacity of the stomach is still small. After the full moon, it can be gradually increased month by month. Now, the breastfeeding time, frequency, and amount within ten days and after the full moon are listed in separate tables below:</p>

<h3>Preface to Venereology</h3>
<p>— Xia Shenchu</p>
<p>The ancients said, "Eating, drinking, men and women, the great desires of man exist therein." How true are these words. With appetite, there is life. With sexual desire, there is procreation. Appetite and sexual desire are the source of life. Cut off eating and drinking, and there are starving corpses on the road. Separate men and women, and there are no human beings left. If eating, drinking, men and women are abolished, the way of life is cut off. Animals seek survival and have struggles. What they fight for is only food and sex. The fighting of crickets, the struggle of chickens and dogs, the selflessness of birds, beasts, and insects, and the mutual slaughter are only to extend their lifeline. The contention and fierce fighting between countries, nations, groups, and individuals, which becomes more and more intense, is also only to extend their lifeline. What is the lifeline? It is nothing but food and sex. Fighting wits and strength, without seizing, it will not stop. Cause and effect follow each other, and revenge is endless. Are human beings tired of fighting and know to return? Tao says to know contentment. Buddha says to abstain from killing. Confucius says to reduce desires. But the world's greed, robbery, and killing remain the same. The power of religion and education is exhausted. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Livelihood and the free love of Europe and the United States want to use political plans to satisfy the desires of men and women for food and drink, so that people can enjoy their work and be at peace. To bring peace to the world and to end the disasters of the world, the enlightened awaken others. Such is the intention of the benevolent. However, its success remains to be seen. It is clear that the struggle cannot be stopped and the soldiers cannot be stopped. Why cannot they be stopped? The desire for eating, drinking, men and women is not yet the right way to deal with it. Fortune is where misfortune lies. Life is the door to killing. This is true. The unkindness of the Creator. The Record says, "There has never been anyone who learns to raise a child and then marries." Animals can breastfeed as soon as they are born. Born knowing, not waiting for knowledge. The machine that drives it starts with desire. Desire is the machine of life and death. If it is not controlled properly, it is enough to harm life. Greatly to the world, and small to the body, the meaning is the same. Drinking poison to quench thirst is not necessarily poison. Fine wine and delicacies are not enough to harm life. Many of us die from eating and drinking. Medical scholars have discussed it in detail. Not only eating and drinking, but also hair and skin, internal organs, limbs, and skeletons can be affected by disease. Medical records are exhaustive, nothing is left out. But what I cannot help but find strange is that medical scholars discuss disease and do not mention sex. Is this not a great regret? The complexity of the sexual organs is no less than that of the digestive system. The impulsiveness of sexual desire is no less than that of eating and drinking. So how can there be no disease of sex? The disease of sex is not only related to personal health, but its impact extends to the love of husband and wife, the peace of society, and the strength of the nation. Is its relationship greater than eating and drinking? I do not know that I am base and vulgar. All diseases of both men and women, including their causes, pathology, symptoms, and methods of maintenance and treatment, are collected, organized, and described separately. After diagnosis, I have held the pen for four years. I regret that I have worked hard but have nothing to teach to the enlightened. Therefore, I publish it, hoping that people of high moral standing within the seas will correct it and increase social knowledge of sexual matters, so that they know what to cherish. I wish the men and women of the world to have the happiness of family, to fulfill the way of life, to grow and prosper, and not to commit suicide. Although it is not enough to stop the great struggle of the universe, perhaps it can also settle the fate of small things. As for venereal diseases such as syphilis, leukorrhea, and chancroid, they are caused by unclean sexual intercourse during the expression of sexual desire. Modern medical scholars also call them venereal diseases. However, this is not a disease of sexual instinct. It does not fall within the scope of this book and will not be discussed. I hope the readers will understand.</p>
<h3>Several Important Discoveries and Inventions in the Development of New Medicine (V)</h3>
<p>— Gu Shoubai</p>
<p>(4) Microbiology and Immunology</p>
<p>Since the invention of the microscope, there has been the development of microbiology. Because of the development of microbiology, research on immunology has been initiated, so these two disciplines are also closely related to the microscope.</p>
<p>Now, almost everyone knows that many important diseases—so-called infectious diseases—are caused by the smallest organisms that cannot be seen with the naked eye and must be seen with a microscope. These smallest organisms are collectively called microorganisms. Those belonging to the plant kingdom are called bacteria; those belonging to the animal kingdom are called protozoa. Microbiology is the study of the morphology and properties of these microorganisms. Immunology is the study of the production, properties, and methods of immunity of immune substances in the human body. The foundations of microbiology were built by Louis Pasteur of France and Robert Koch of Germany. The former was the pioneer of preventive inoculation, and the latter was a researcher of infectious pathogens. Both have immortal achievements.</p>
<p>Before Pasteur, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek also discovered protozoa under a microscope, and soon after discovered bacteria. Later, some people successively discovered the pathogenic microorganisms of silkworms, the sarcinae bacteria in the human stomach, and the anthrax bacillus and its spores in horses.</p>
<h3>The Relationship Between Recovery from Pulmonary Tuberculosis and Weight Gain</h3>
<p>— Shi Yunzhe</p>
<p>The gradual increase in weight of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis during the recovery period is undoubtedly a good sign that the disease is subsiding, but it is not necessarily absolute. Why? Because there are two types of weight gain. One is that the increase is permanent and unchanging. The other is that the increase is a temporary phenomenon. The former is a good sign. The latter is not necessarily a good sign. The reason why the latter's weight temporarily increases is mostly because of changes in the previous lifestyle due to entering a sanatorium or moving to a sanatorium. Moreover, it is because they are kept quiet in a good climate and take a lot of nourishing things. As such, it is not only patients, but anyone who does this can increase their weight in a short period of time. This is because a kind of lifestyle causes a physiological increase in weight, not because the pulmonary tuberculosis is completely cured and the weight increases. This can be proven by facts. That is, even if they are discharged from the hospital or return home from a sanatorium, and return to their previous lifestyle, the increased weight can still decrease within a few months. If the disease is really completely cured, then the increased weight will never decrease again. Therefore, it is known that the degree of cure of lung disease is often parallel to weight gain.</p>
<p>Patients who are resting at home, carefully follow the methods of pulmonary tuberculosis recuperation, such as paying attention to air, sunlight, quietness, and nutrition. (For details, please refer to the author's translated "Pulmonary Disease Prevention and Recuperation Rules," which are sold on behalf of the author's Jin Society on Sima Road.) Even without specially taking rich nourishing things, only endure recuperation, or patients who are already in the recovery period, and perform business slightly every day. The weight gain of such patients is often late. But the weight that has already increased does not decrease for a long time later. The more certain the disease is cured, the more certain the weight is. Why is this? It is because the patients are in their long-accustomed living place and do not change their usual living state. They recuperate well. Therefore, although their weight gain is late, the increased weight is almost parallel to the degree of cure of the disease.</p>
<p>In the past, it was often considered appropriate to give patients with lung disease excessive and large amounts of nourishing things. This is actually a mistake. Although the weight of patients who are given more nourishing things can increase, if they stop taking them, they will decrease again. Or, they move to a good climate place, or they are admitted to a hospital, and their weight increases, but if they return home, they will decrease again. This is because the weight gain is not due to the true cure of the disease. Therefore, for patients with mild symptoms and latent tuberculosis patients, it is better to pay attention to health preservation while continuing their daily life than to move to a sanatorium. Its effectiveness is more. The old weight when we were healthy before the onset of the disease is what we can use as a standard to infer the degree of recovery from the disease from the weight. If the disease is already moving towards the area of cure, then the weight cannot but recover to the old weight. This is a matter of course. Therefore, it is not correct to optimistically think that the disease has been cured because the weight has clearly increased during the recuperation period. Or, it is not correct to be pessimistic if the fever has subsided and other subjective symptoms are also good, but the increase in weight is still small. Such judgments depend on medical professionals with specialized knowledge.</p>

<h3>Watermelon</h3>
<p>— Yongzi</p>
<p>These days, watermelons have truly become the small and weak nations under the knives of imperialists. Some wealthy gentlemen eat one all by themselves, while poorer ones buy pieces to eat. If, in this hot weather, one has not yet tasted watermelon, it is simply like a 20th-century imperialist who doesn't have the twisted idea of invading others—it's hard to find even if you're kicking your heels.</p>
<p>It's said that there are several ways to eat watermelon.</p>
<p>One way is to only chew the juice and not swallow the pulp, because the pulp is easily accumulated in the stomach and intestines, leading to gastrointestinal diseases in the autumn. If you only chew the juice, it's cooling and refreshing, and beneficial for clearing inflammation, making the large and small intestines smooth and peaceful, like an imperialist who only seeks to increase trade relations and has no ambition to annex land. This is the smartest way to eat.</p>
<p>Another way is to swallow the juice and pulp all at once, gobbling it down without worrying about the future. As long as there's something to eat now, let's eat it heartily. This is like an imperialist who doesn't just look at other people's money, but even wants to put their land and administrative power into his own pocket. Although this isn't very pretty, and it's also not a very civilized way to eat, it's truly eating watermelon in the true sense of the word.</p>
<p>Friends who study eating watermelon don't like to eat it when it's not ripe, and they don't welcome it when it's overripe. Their reason is that when it's not ripe, it's too firm, and it takes a lot of effort to chew out the juice, and the juice has a sour taste, which isn't very delicious. When it's too ripe, the pulp on the surface is like pieces of old cotton, and the sweet and delicious watermelon juice has dried up. Therefore, those who are good at eating watermelon especially like to pick watermelons that are not overripe, and whose internal pulp is about to split but has not yet split, because this is when the juice is most abundant and the taste is most beautiful.</p>
<p>Inside the watermelon, there are watermelon seeds. Watermelon seeds can be used to propagate the watermelon, but people are too fierce, often eating the watermelon and then frying the watermelon seeds. If the watermelon truly symbolizes a country, and is cut, divided, chewed, and swallowed by people, and finally the watermelon seeds are fried, what a wretched scene!</p>
<h3>Summer in the City</h3>
<p>— Huoxueming</p>
<p>The streets are flowing with fire, and the red posters lacquered on wood dazzle the eyes. The electric wires are still, and the leaves are as if they were dead. Everything is immersed in a hot pot, and even the tongue of the Western police dog is dragging out of its mouth, red, dripping saliva. Only the cars driven by high-class Chinese and foreign gentlemen, speeding past in a stream, fly over the heads of pedestrians. Only then is the air vibrated and stirred up a bit of "royal demeanor," carrying sand and dust, and sticking to the sweaty faces of pedestrians, as if they were covered with a layer of dead ashes, so greasy!</p>
<p>However, in the cafes, people drinking ice, under the electric fans, face their smiling companions while they drink the overly cold liquid with silver spoons or pure wheat straws, scooping and sucking, pouring it into their own intestines, which are also too hot. "It's so hot!" everyone calls out. But there, the sun is not seen because the windows are covered by green dragon-beard curtains.</p>
<p>Another aspect of the city: along the Huangpu River, the yellow and turbid water weighs heavily, and the fiery red, sullen blue, and swollen black warships are tiredly resting. However, on the docks, among the mixed dust and coal smoke, half-naked laborers are coming and going in droves, carrying goods from the ship's belly, hoisting them on their shoulders, and moving them into huge warehouses. Their bare feet are stepping on the fiery hot asphalt road, their bare legs are exposed to the fiery hot sunlight, and their bare backs are carrying fiery hot goods. They sweat, they pant, and even if they suffer from heatstroke and collapse on the roadside, it doesn't count as a big deal. Everyone just calls out, "It's hot!"</p>
<p>That's right, we have walked into the fiery hell of summer from the light spring. I don't know if the men and women at the Gaohashi beach have also called out "It's hot!" Or perhaps the farmer would point to his daughter and say, "Don't stand here, why are you looking at those naked people…? Go, take the hoe and cut the grass!"</p>
<p>That's right, summer gives us harshness, but why can't we do a little more useful work under the harshness? If the grass in the fields is not cut clean, will the cotton ripen? Even if autumn comes, perhaps there will be happy people calling out again, "It's cold!"</p>
<h3>Summer Night Promenade in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Guo Lanxin</p>
<p>In the twilight of the lamp shadows, I came out of the New Asia Hotel and stepped onto North Sichuan Road. After sending off Miss Jin, Mr. Zhang, and Miss Wu by car to St. Anna's on Yuyuan Road, I strolled back among the street lamps and crowds.</p>
<p>The summer nights in the city contain many temptations and stimuli. The intense heat of the day has already begun to subside at this time, and a cool wind blows. Above the towering skyscrapers, a half-round moon hangs, neither thin nor fat, like a lover's delicate face, making people's hearts float and also washing away the heat in the chest. White clouds fly past, like pieces of cicada-wing gauze covering the sky.</p>
<p>The Chinese Bank Hongkou Apartment's grand building on North Sichuan Road is a new effort after the disaster. The war wounds that were full of scars have gradually been buried by new buildings. You can no longer see the thousands of bloodstains and tear stains. The world passes in this way.</p>
<p>Passing by the Bund, the lights of boats in the Huangpu River are like scattered stars, and also like many enchanting eyes. The Bund Park is crowded with men and women enjoying the cool air. Some are using the cover of enjoying the cool air to pursue flirting. Look, the men and women are all young, and the rose-colored blush contains youth.</p>
<p>Going west on Nanjing Road, the splendor of the Lihong lights is truly moving, like a woman's ever-changing new makeup, giving people love, giving people dizziness, and also giving people affection. I hate that the place at the Rising Sun Building is too tedious, so I hurried past without stopping. Standing under the foreign maple trees on Jing'an Temple Road near the racecourse, the clock of the Red Tin House, the door lights of the Great World, the roof of the Oriental Great China Hotel, and the bell tower of the Moore Church, look back at the ten thousand silver lights of the three major companies, the new look of the Hua'an Building and the Daguangming, and the future tallest building in the East, squatting like a giant. Ah, this is a representative work of the prosperous city! In this silver-lit area.</p>
<p>After hearing the waltz music of the Great Shanghai Ballroom flying out from the window, I went west. Turning at Chengdu Road, the bright moon in the sky shines on me, as if I had jumped out of the city. I love such a clear and light scenery, I love such a quiet summer night.</p>
<p>Returning home, I want to rest quietly by the lamp in the small building, but suddenly the soft singing voice leaks from the lake-green curtains of the opposite building. I hear that this is the tune of "Where Are You Going Tonight?" I am buried in this intoxicating singing voice, and the moonlight slowly enters my embrace, quietly, quietly, the night is gradually passing.</p>
<h3>Northeast Fourth Company Commander</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twelve: The Poor and Humble Join the Army, the Sickly Fall Behind, Willing to Retire, the Soldiers Overflow with Emotion</p>
<p>Originally, this gathering of bugle calls was a very common thing; it was a routine occurrence before the 9 o'clock evening roll call. Today's officer of the day was someone else, so Zhao Ziqiang didn't need to go. His hasty rush upstairs to get dressed was simply a meaningless act. So, after thinking about it, he couldn't help but laugh. However, his moment of clarity was ultimately very brief. After ten minutes, sitting on his bed, he sank into thought again. He was thinking that, no matter what, he had to find a moment tomorrow to go back to his home in Haidian for a visit. This wasn't for any other reason than that the matchmaker and both families had agreed on everything. If the groom's family didn't show some sign to the bride's family, it would seem as if the groom's family was having second thoughts. Wouldn't that put the matter on hold indefinitely? Even if it was only for ten minutes, he should still go back for a visit. But then again, these were the days right before the Commander-in-Chief was scheduled to come for inspection. If he went home when the Commander-in-Chief was inspecting, it would cause a mess, and he didn't know how it would be sorted out. He sat there, deep in thought, when suddenly everything went dark—the lights had been turned off. After lights out, there was nothing to do but sleep. He slowly lay down, still slowly thinking, feeling that Miss Yang Jia Guizhi was not some completely modern person, but her attire and actions weren't stubbornly old-fashioned either. This was exactly the kind of person he had always imagined as his ideal. Not only would he marry her to be his wife, but if the citizens were holding a public election for something like a district chief or neighborhood head, he would definitely vote for someone like her. He felt that he was a half-new, half-old kind of person, and only someone like this would be a good match for him. Thinking this way, he felt that discussing the marriage proposal to the Yang family with his father was something that could not be delayed at all. (137)</p>
<h3>China Ten Years Hence</h3>
<p>— Ning Yi</p>
<p>The dispute in this examination arose because the English essay prompt, "China Ten Years Hence," was leaked. But this topic is quite interesting; no one knows what China will be like ten years from now! So I might as well take a guess.</p>
<p>Perhaps ten years from now, constitutionalism will be flourishing, and pan-nationalism will have gained dominance, with imperialism gradually being eliminated! But some say: maybe prolonged resistance and non-resistance will prevail for a time ten years from now? With our country as the initiator, will our territory shrink day by day?</p>
<p>Ten years from now, Japan will have been destroyed in the Second World War, so our country will not only have recovered lost territories like Korea and Taiwan, but also occupied Japan, becoming a major power in East Asia? Ten years from now, bathhouses will be obsolete, but massage parlors will be as conspicuous as coal-fired stoves. All middle schools will also have massage specialty departments, and all female graduates will be recommended by the school authorities to massage parlors in various ports to work as massage girls! Ten years from now, those who hold positions in the education sector will be those who are currently involved in student movements?</p>

<h3>Qingdao Seaside Bathing Diary</h3>
<p>— Xu Tongye</p>
<p>Qingdao is located on the coast, with natural scenery. It is not only an important town in Shandong Province, but also a famous summer resort. Every summer, Chinese and foreigners alike come in groups to enjoy sea bathing together. For the past few years, I have been running around, unable to rest. Although traveling to Qingdao has been on my mind, I have never set foot there. I have often heard my friends speak highly of the beautiful scenery of Qingdao, which has made me long for it. Last month, I received an invitation from my elder brother, so I packed my bags and set off, fulfilling my long-cherished wish. There is no greater joy in life than this. From the residence on Guantao Road to the bathing beach, it is about five miles away. Passing through Zhongshan Road, Taiping Road, and Laiyang Road, all are wide and flat avenues. The bathing beach is located in front of the naval aviation field, close to the seaside park. The scenery is the most beautiful, the best in Jiangsu, Shandong, and Zhejiang. The dilapidated West Lake cannot compare. The beach is built with hundreds of Western-style two-story wooden houses, each with seven or eight rooms, numbered for Chinese and foreigners to rent for rest and changing clothes. Qingdao's various public offices also have these small houses. Every day, thousands of people bathe in the sea, especially women and children. In the center of the beach is a watchtower, responsible for the safety of swimmers. There are also dozens of small boats, each holding five or six people, for guests to rent and row, also used for practice. Sea bathers wear bathing suits. If they have not rented a changing room in advance, or if there are no vacant houses, they can change into their bathing suits at their residence and go barefoot, wearing rubber shoes, by rickshaw. Western women often add sailor-style baggy pants over their bathing suits. When they arrive at the bathing beach, they take off their outer clothes and can enter the sea. Both men and women wear fisherman-style large sun hats. If you want to sit on the beach, you can bring sheets, fruits, and soda, and rent a large cloth umbrella for half a day of leisure. However, sea bathers should not stay in the water for too long. Get out after soaking for a while, because foot swelling is a common ailment at the bathing beach. Newcomers should be aware of this. This summer, the North China Games are being held in Qingdao, and athletes from all over the country have gathered here. The bathing beach has also added many athletes, truly a grand event.</p>
<h3>Qingdao's Seaside Bathing Beach</h3>
<p>— Miaoshen</p>
<p>I spent the summer in Qingdao the year before last. I still have infinite fondness for the lush, green Qingdao. Especially the seaside bathing beach, on this hot summer day, makes me even more longing. Although Shanghai has swimming pools, the larger ones like the Hongkou Swimming Pool, how can they compare to even a fraction of the Qingdao seaside bathing beach?</p>
<p>The Qingdao seaside bathing beach is along the South Sea. This place is a natural sandy beach for sea bathing. The beach is very shallow, surrounded by small hills on three sides. On the other side of the beach, countless changing huts are built. Some of these are private, some are public. The public ones can be rented, and the rental fee is calculated for a summer.</p>
<p>Around two or three in the afternoon, swimmers come one after another, wearing swimming suits or carrying rubber rings. There are many Westerners and Japanese among these swimmers, and most of them are long-term guests who come every day. Many Chinese come to join the fun. When we change into our swimming suits and walk barefoot out of the small house, we step on the soft, sandy beach. The sand is fine and cool, rubbing under our feet, giving a strange feeling of pleasure. We look at the red, green, and beautiful men and women floating in the sea, and our fiery envy unconsciously makes us accelerate the movement of our legs, rushing quickly towards the sea. Just as a wave comes, it wets half of our swimming suit, and we feel so comfortable and cool on our legs. We gradually walk further, and the seawater is already at our chest. We see a woman wearing a green rubber cap and a bright red striped woolen shirt, paddling her snow-white arms and legs forward, swimming towards us. Her posture and speed are very skillful. At this time, Mr. Xu, who is with us, says, "I'm afraid she's Japanese, right?" Saying this, he plunges into the water and chases after the woman. Seeing someone chasing her, the woman rushes forward even faster. We see two white splashes of water behind their legs, shimmering with golden light under the sun.</p>
<p>There are very few Chinese women who can swim to the diving platform and dive into the sea, only Western women and Japanese women. After swimming in the sea for about an hour, it is very necessary to come ashore to rest for a while, lying on the beach and playing with the sand with both hands, which is very interesting. Western girls like to make a small pot in the sand, burying their feet in the sand, thinking that it is cool and refreshing to the heart and lungs, even more interesting. After swimming, rinsing off under the tap water is like being infused with nectar, indescribably wonderful. Because we have been swimming for half a day, we inevitably swallow a few mouthfuls of seawater. Occasionally tasting the fresh tap water, it is as sweet as drinking sweet dew.</p>

<h3>Investigation Results of the Case of Pre-Leakage of High School Graduation Examination Questions in This City</h3>
<p>The prosecutor of the local court has indicted Xie Ying and three others.</p>
<p>Results of secondary school supplementary, make-up and re-examinations announced today</p>
<p>Regarding the case of the pre-leakage of some high school examination questions in this city's secondary school graduation examinations, the City Education Bureau previously transferred the testimony of 1,000 people to the Shanghai Local Court for investigation. It is now learned that the case has been investigated by the prosecutor of the court, and a public prosecution has been filed. It is said that the defendants are Zhang Jieliang, a proofreader at the Nanjing Printing Company, Xie Zhen, an assistant in the advertising section of the Nanjing Central Daily News, Xie Mingxiong, and Xie Ying, a student at Jianguo Middle School. None of them are employees of the Education Bureau. As for the students of Jianguo Middle School who participated in the high school graduation examination, except for Xie Ying, whose qualifications have been revoked, the examination results of the remaining students were temporarily retained by the Bureau Affairs Conference because the case was still under investigation. Now that the investigation has yielded results, they have been recognized separately, or ordered to take re-examinations, make-up examinations, or re-evaluations, as appropriate. It is also learned that the secondary school graduation examinations in this city, after this twist, were only completed on the 15th of this month. The student results were compiled and published in a special issue by the Education Bureau, which was attached to today's Morning Post. It is estimated that in the two rounds, approximately 800 high school students and 1,500 junior high school students were approved for graduation, accounting for 80% of the total number of examinees. However, there are still about 180 high school students who have not completed their studies. In consideration of the students, the Education Bureau, in accordance with the instructions of the Ministry of Education, has approved the prior issuance of certificates so that they can apply to colleges and universities. After being admitted to the entrance examination, they must still apply to the Bureau for make-up examinations for the unfinished subjects. If they pass the make-up examinations, their graduation and admission qualifications will be recognized. This list will also be announced in the special issue. The following is an excerpt of the main points of the indictment of the court prosecutor, which states: "Xie Zhen is an advertising assistant at the Nanjing Central Daily News. His younger brother, Xie Ying, is a senior in the high school department of Jianguo Middle School in Zhabei Tiantong'an, this city. In June of this year, the Shanghai City Education Bureau held secondary school graduation examinations. All the examination questions were sealed and sent by Director Pan Gongzhan to Zhu Zhensun, a staff member of the Third Section Examination Division, and Liu Jian'an, a clerk, to Nanjing Chengxian Street Nanjing Printing Company, entrusting Shao Zilin and Zhang Tingfang of the company to print them carefully. Xie Zhen and Zhang Jieliang, a proofreader at the company, were acquainted. Knowing that Xie Ying's coursework at school would not allow him to pass the examination, he asked Jieliang to steal the examination questions and send them to Pearl Bridge, where he would take them to Shanghai to Xie Ying. He invited his close friends Yu Tong and He Jiaming to the Dacheng Hotel in Jielu Xiangli, rented a room, prepared answers, and invited Xie Ying to take the examination with the other graduates. On the morning of June 17, the high school examinees in the first examination hall protested and boycotted the examination because the foreign language composition test questions had been pre-leaked. After the Education Bureau sent a letter for investigation, the original examination questions (page 2 of the printed English test questions) stolen by Zhang Jieliang were found in Xie Ying's dormitory. Xie Ying and Zhang Jieliang were arrested one after another. Xie Zhen then surrendered himself and confessed that Zhang Jieliang had given him the original English test questions and other items, but he did not admit to instigating the theft. If he had not instigated it, why would Zhang Jieliang have stolen them for no reason? Although Zhang Jieliang confessed to copying the test questions and giving them to Xie Zhen, he denied handing over the original test questions. It is not known how he had the opportunity and time to copy them one by one under the strict supervision of Education Bureau specialists Zhu Zhensun and Liu Jian'an and shop employees Shao Zilin and Zhang Tingfang. It is obvious that he stole them when the company handed him the test questions for proofreading. The original English test question found in his possession was indeed given to him by Zhang Jieliang, as stated by Xie Zhen and Xie Ying, and there is no room for denial. The defendant Zhang Jieliang, because he embezzled property belonging to others in the course of his business, is in violation of Article 357, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. The defendant Xie Zhen, being a person without status, instigated the embezzlement in the course of business, shall be punished in accordance with Article 43, Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 2, and Article 45, Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 2 of the same law, and Article 356 of the same law. The defendant Xie Ying received stolen goods, in violation of Article 376, Paragraph 1 of the same law. Therefore, in accordance with Article 253, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the prosecution is filed and sent for trial."</p>

Initially, the American players concentrated their attack on Hughes, trying to make him exhausted, but finding that the plan did not work, they switched to attacking Penman and succeeded.

<h3>Guanghua Track and Field Team Triumphant Return</h3>
<p>Victories in Both Hong Kong and Guangzhou</p>
<p>| Peng Wenyu Talks About the Southern Expedition |</p>
<p>After winning both the track and field and all-around championships at the Jiangnan Eight Universities Games this year, the Guanghua University track and field team members were even more motivated. Taking advantage of the summer vacation, they made a southern expedition to Guangzhou and Hong Kong to explore the scenery of southern China. Led by coach Peng Wenyu, captain Wang Jihuai, and officer Huang Jiahua, more than ten athletes set off from Shanghai at the end of last month. They first arrived in Guangzhou and competed against the Guangdong United Team, winning decisively on the first day with a score of 35-19. On the second day, the Guangdong United Team withdrew from the competition, and Guanghua performed an exhibition match. Later, they went to Hong Kong and competed against the South China Athletic Association, with Guanghua winning 70-29. The team arrived in Shanghai at 3:00 PM yesterday and held a banquet at Zhimeilou that evening. The following is a record of their southern expedition:</p>
<p>Weary from the Journey The team set off on the 28th of last month. They experienced sea travel for the first time and encountered a major storm. The team members suffered from the rocking of the ship, with some experiencing dizziness and vomiting. Their spirits were greatly affected. They arrived in Guangzhou on the 4th, where they were hosted by Lingnan University. The competition against the Guangdong United Team was scheduled for the 12th and 13th. On the first day, Guanghua won decisively with a score of 35-19. On the second day, the Guanghua team and referees were all dressed and ready, but the Guangdong United Team was late. Guanghua athletes had no choice but to perform an exhibition match. They left Guangzhou for Hong Kong on the 15th and competed against the South China Athletic Association, which has a gathering of Hong Kong talents, on the 18th. Guanghua won decisively with a score of 70-29. They left Hong Kong on the 19th and returned triumphantly, arriving in Shanghai at around 3:00 PM yesterday.</p>
<p>Results in Guangzhou The Guangdong United Team included many outstanding athletes from Sun Yat-sen University and the Sports Academy, but there were no exceptional talents. The first place in the 100 meters was He Peigen from the Sports Academy, with a time of 10.8 seconds. Although this was considered excellent, the timing was not accurate. Judging from He's strength, he is indeed a promising talent. The full results are as follows:</p>
<p>Event 1st Place 2nd Place 3rd Place Result 100m He Peigen (Guangdong) Zhu Zhong (Guangdong) Dong Yinchu (Guanghua) 10.8 seconds 200m Dong Yinchu (Guanghua) Shen Bingyan (Guanghua) Wu Liansheng (Guangdong) 25.0 seconds 400m Dong Shuzhao (Guanghua) Tao Yingjie (Guanghua) Shen Bingyan (Guanghua) 55.0 seconds 800m Dong Shuzhao (Guanghua) Liu Chongli (Guanghua) 2 minutes 9.8 seconds 1500m Dong Shuzhao (Guanghua) Li Yukun (Guangdong) Liu Chongli (Guanghua) 4 minutes 41.2 seconds 110m Hurdles Tao Yingjie (Guanghua) Deng Zhiming (Guangdong) 18.2 seconds 400m Hurdles Tao Yingjie (Guanghua) 61.0 seconds Shot Put Wang Jihuai (Guanghua) Hong Yiting (Guanghua) Huang Decheng (Guangdong) 10.61 meters Javelin Wang Jihuai (Guanghua) Huang Decheng (Guangdong) Xue Wentao (Guangdong) 41.25 meters Discus Wang Jihuai (Guanghua) Ding Qian (Guangdong) 31.75 meters</p>
<p>Decisive Victory Over South China The South China Athletic Association is where Hong Kong's track and field talents gather, but they do not have outstanding results, and the talent pool is not widespread. In this competition, they were missing in the three field events. The scoring was calculated as 5-3-1. There was also a special medley relay race with a distance of 1200 meters, divided into four runners. The first runner ran 400 meters, the second and third runners each ran 200 meters, and the fourth runner ran another 400 meters. The Guanghua team finished first: (1) Tao Yingjie, (2) Dong Yinchu, (3) Wang Jihuai, (4) Dong Shuzhao. The South China team finished second: (1) Zhong Huazhuo, (2) Xu Zijun, (3) Li Peisen, (4) Guo Huiyu. In a total of eleven events, South China only won the pole vault. Guanghua scored a total of 70 points, and South China scored 29 points.</p>

<p>Overall Review According to Guanghua coach Peng Wenyu and captain Wang Jihuai, the results of this southern expedition were somewhat disappointing due to the lack of fierce competition. Guangdong does not pay much attention to track and field, and the refereeing skills are also mediocre. For example, the starter does not use Mandarin or English, but only Cantonese, which is not in accordance with the rules and caused great inconvenience to Guanghua. In the upcoming National Games, Guangdong athletes will inevitably be restricted due to the lack of proper training for starting. The long jump results in the competition against South China were quite good. Wang Jihuai jumped 6.60 meters, Rong Qifang jumped 6.45 meters, and Hong Yiting jumped 6.44 meters. These are not easy to achieve. He Peigen's 10.8 seconds in the 100 meters in Guangzhou was not accurate, but he is indeed a promising talent.</p>
<p>Southern Scenery Because of the economic panic this year, Hong Kong Chinese will not participate in the National Games alone and may merge into Guangdong. The sports community in Guangzhou considers volleyball a daily pastime and does not pay much attention to track and field. The facilities are also very simple. In the competition between Guanghua and the Guangdong United Team, Ding Qian, who took second place in the discus, is an American and the sports instructor at Lingnan University. He could throw the discus over 130 feet three or four years ago and scored points in the All-American Games. The Jimei Women's Basketball Team defeated the Liangjiang Women's Basketball Team with a score of 33-17. The Jimei team is small but highly skilled, with short hair like men and faces as dark as coal. If they were mixed in a men's team, it would be difficult to distinguish them. The Jimei team plans to come to Shanghai for a competition before the National Games.</p>
<h3>Xianfang Cup Yesterday's Results</h3>
<p>Youyou, Youyi, Green Light, Xiaguang and Other Teams Win The Xianfang Cup Tennis League held its fourth act as scheduled yesterday. The most important match between the Railway team and the Zhonghua team may have been interrupted by thunderstorms and could not be completed. As for the result, the reporter had not seen a definite report by the time of writing late at night. The results of the matches that have been played are recorded below:</p>
<p>Youyou Defeats Datong...14-1</p>
<p>Youyou's match against Datong yesterday was almost entirely one-sided, so there was nothing exciting to report. Moreover, Datong's first doubles team only had Hu Xinnan to play, so it was difficult to form a team and could only forfeit. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Guo Yujie (Youyou) defeats Gu Ningxian (Datong) 6-2, 6-2, 6-4 (2) Liu Keng (Youyou) defeats Mai Fengtang (Datong) 7-5, 6-2, 6-4 (3) Guo Yujie and Tang Yongchun (Youyou) win by Datong's forfeit. Youyou wins 3-0 (4) Liu Keng and Gu Ningxian (Youyou) defeat Liang Guanying and Ping Chutong (Datong) 6-1, 7-5, 6-2 (5) Cheng Yize and Mai Fengtang (Youyou) defeat Mao Honggui and Shen Zengyin (Datong) 6-1, 6-4, 5-6</p>
<p>Youyi Defeats Yukuai...9-6 This year, Yukuai's strength is completely different from before. Yesterday, they were defeated by Youyi again. Compared to their glorious days as champions last year, it is truly a bittersweet feeling. Youyi's fighting spirit is commendable, and it is fitting that they returned in triumph.</p>
<p>(1) Ma Anquan (Yukuai) defeats Mao Hongfa (Youyi) 10-8, 6-2, 6-2 (2) Zhuo Guanpei (Youyi) defeats Kuai Shiyuan (Yukuai) 6-2, 8-1, 6-2 (3) Ma Anquan (Yukuai) defeats Shen Baigui (Youyi) 6-2, 6-4, 6-4 (4) Kuai Shiwu (Yukuai) defeats Mao Hongfa (Youyi) 6-2, 6-4, 6-4 (5) Zhuo Guanpei (Youyi) defeats Lin Leming (Yukuai) 6-4, 6-4, 6-2 (6) Zhu Qiu (Youyi) defeats Gu Daqi (Yukuai) 6-4, 6-4, 6-2 (7) Shao Yueping (Youyi) defeats Huang Hongdao (Yukuai) 7-5, 7-5, 6-0 (8) Ye Jinmian (Youyi) defeats Zhang Jikang (Yukuai) 7-5, 7-5, 6-0</p>
<p>Green Light Defeats Meilu...12-3 Except for a complete victory in the second doubles match, Meilu lost all the other matches yesterday. Green Light's two players, Wang Wenzheng and Qian Wensai, have excellent skills and are among the best talents. Although the Hu family tried hard to deal with them, they eventually retreated. The form of each game was not tight, and there was nothing to say about excitement. Let's take a look at its battle below</p>
<p>(1) Wang Wenzheng (Green) defeats Hu Qichang (Mei) 6-1 6-2 6-1 (2) Qian Wenbao (Green) defeats Hu Qizhuo (Mei) 6-1 6-2 6-3 (3) Wang Wenzheng (Green) defeats Hu Qifeng (Mei) 6-2 6-2 6-1 Qian Wenmai (Green) defeats Hu Qizhuo (Mei) 6-2 6-2 6-1 (4) Hu Qichang (Mei) defeats Yao Zhenquan (Green) 6-1 6-2 6-1 Hu Qichao (Mei) defeats Gu Zaiping (Green) 6-1 6-2 6-1 (5) Yuan Shilong (Green) defeats Hu Yunqiu (Mei) 6-4 6-0 6-2 Hou Shangxiong (Green) defeats Hu Yunlai (Mei) 6-4 6-0 6-2</p>
<p>Xiaguang Defeats Feili...11-4 Xiaguang's two generals, He and Chen, are fighting more and more bravely, which is the light of Daxia. It is a pity that the talents of the whole team are not very average, otherwise they should also be able to win the championship with teams such as Youyou Railway and shake the Shanghai beach.</p>
<p>(1) He Qiu (Xia) defeats Sun Chengbi (Fei) 6-0 6-1 6-3 (2) Chen Bainian (Xia) defeats Wang Xudong (Fei) 6-0 7-5 6-5 (3) He Qiu (Xia) defeats Sun Chengbiao (Fei) 6-2 6-4 4-6 Wu Youxiong (Xia) defeats Wang Xudong (Fei) 6-2 6-4 4-6 (4) Chen Bainian and Shen Meizhen (Xia) win Fei Li by default Xia Guang wins 3-0 (5) Xia Hongshou (Fei) defeats Wu Haoran (Xia) 7-5 6-0 Wu Wang and Zhang Zuwang (Fei) defeat Wang Zhiwei (Xia) 7-5 6-0 by default</p>
<p>Shenyu Defeats Chenguang...15-0 According to the report of the Shenyu team, they waited for the Chenguang team until 5 pm yesterday, but no one from the team was seen, and it was deemed as a default according to the regulations. Shenyu won 15-0. (According to Article 12 of the regulations of the reporter's press association,"Default twice, that is, cancel its membership qualification," Then Chenguang will be penalized if it defaults once again for no reason. It is hoped that Chenguang will pay close attention to it so as not to damage the competitive spirit of the Xianfang Cup. )</p>

<h3>The "Push" of the Third Kind of Person</h3>
<p>— Da Wu</p>
<p>Recently, I had something to do and went to Hankou once. The day before I set off, I saw a "small news item" in the newspaper, saying that a Shanxi widow in Wuhu, bringing her orphan, came to Shanghai to make a living but failed and had to return to her hometown empty-handed; because she didn't have money to buy a ticket, she was pushed into the river by the room service on the Jianguo Wheelboat and drowned. The orphan was abandoned on the shore. In this year when everyone is busy with internal and external affairs, naturally no one pays attention to this kind of thing.</p>
<p>But this made me think of the incident not long ago where a newspaper boy was pushed under a tram and crushed to death, and the accident at a certain theater where more than a dozen people were pushed and trampled to death.</p>
<p>Those who are pushed and trampled to death are mostly women and children, and they are "lower class."</p>
<p>I also thought of a certain gentleman who wrote an article about this matter, titled "Push." The general idea is that we can often encounter two kinds of people who make a living by pushing, one is the foreign adults, and the other is compatriots, but they are "upper class." But according to my personal experience on this trip, in addition to the two kinds of pushing mentioned above, there is also a third kind of person's "push." This kind of person is neither "upper class" nor convenient to be listed as "lower class." However, he wants to "help" the "upper class" to push the "lower class." The Shanxi widow was pushed into the water by this kind of helping person.</p>
<p>This kind of "helping" person exists both on land and on ships, belonging to the "amphibious" category. Small vendors and craftsmen on the road are often robbed of their "tools" and thrown more than ten feet away, and they themselves are pushed to the ground, even losing their lives. This is the third kind of "pushing" method. It is helped by the "upper class" to push. Mostly people wearing copper basin hats and holding funeral sticks, etc., this is on land.</p>
<p>Onboarding, entering the cabin, disembarking, you will also be pushed. This is also the third kind of "pushing" method. But it is limited to those who sit in the third class or buy half-price tickets, or cannot afford tickets. Those who buy third-class tickets will be pushed by people in the cabins. Those who only buy ship tickets but not berths will be pushed by people in any cabin, pushing you to a point where you have no place to stand. As for people who cannot even afford ship tickets, they will be straightforward and pushed ashore or into the water. In case the ship has sailed and you are discovered, they will first search you thoroughly, take out a dime or two, or a dozen copper coins from the corners of your clothes or waistband, and use them as ship fare, and then push you into the cargo hold at the bottom of the ship. And after this, regardless of distance or duration, the ship will not provide meals, and you will be starved half to death. These things are all done by the "helpers" on the ship, using the "third kind of push."</p>
<p>On this trip, I personally saw two poor students who came up from Nanjing, bought ship tickets but could not afford berths, and were pushed around, unable to find a place to stand. They asked me, who was standing beside "watching": "We paid money to buy tickets, but they won't let us stand, is the money supposed to be wasted?" I told them: "You paid the money, and they will naturally 'push' you from Nanjing to Shanghai!"</p>
<h3>A Shortcut to Reading Small Publications</h3>
<p>— Another Realm</p>
<p>Now is the heyday of small publications. In my opinion, these small publications have developed from the previous formats of "short weapons," "small daggers," and "demon-revealing mirrors." But reading these small publications is not an easy task. One is naturally due to the complexity of political factions: the second is due to the progress of the literati's minds.</p>
<p>To achieve political effect, implication is more effective than direct statement. This seems to have been stolen from literary techniques, but unfortunately, there is no way to prove whether these writers are all literary people. Naturally, it is still because the Chinese New Literature Movement is too short, so it was not until today that this more mature technique was produced. In the past, the small publications did not use such clever techniques. After criticizing or scolding others for being bad or wrong, they would then tell the reader: "We are right!" "Long live us!" This is the so-called injection-style teaching method, which is obviously a stupid method. But this method is not without value, but it is not suitable for publications that generally need to hide their heads and tails and promote subtly.</p>
<p>In short, the writing style of these small publications now is not difficult to learn. They are only unified under a simple formula, that is:</p>
<p>Scold + Scold + Scold + ...... After this, they never put forward "support" or that kind of blatant "long liveism," and stop there, making the reader feel that the aftertaste is endless.</p>
<p>The ingenuity lies here. They are naturally not "scolding-downists." After you are not good and he is not good, there must be something good inside. This good thing is not openly put forward. It is either someone else, or his own master, or the side he wants to reach out to.</p>
<p>If the reader clears up the miscellaneous thoughts of all parties, he will naturally believe in his side. This is his political effect.</p>
<p>However, if the reader wants to return it to its true "home," he must first have a general understanding of the various political factions at present.</p>
<h3>Night</h3>
<p>— Shi Heng</p>
<p>In the darkness of night, demons open their fierce eyes. The city of night gleams with a desolate light, like a massive monster spewing fiery tongues of ten thousand feet.</p>
<p>On the streets of the city, shimmering with various lights, flow tens of thousands of fleshy corpses, like ghostly shadows.</p>
<p>The entire city has transformed into a world of rampant lust: wild dances accompanied by orchestral music, drunken embraces of female corpses, gambling that excites the heart, all the weary exaltation of desire.</p>
<p>But the darkness of night is fleeting; the sky reveals a fish-belly white color. Dawn is about to appear on earth; it is time for demons to hide their traces.</p>
<p>From the dance hall under the red and green lights, two young men and women stagger out; they might still be young students who are the hope of the future.</p>
<p>The woman, beneath her fluffy, curly hair, has a round cat-like face; her flesh is dead, stiff, covered in white powder, with two patches of rouge piled on her cheeks, mixed with sweat and streaks. A long cheongsam, high-heeled leather shoes, long stockings. What is most striking about her walk is the sight of her particularly well-developed buttocks and breasts hidden within her clothing—her pride, her assets.</p>
<p>The man looks anemic, with a sallow and emaciated face; there is no light in his eyes, only a layer of weary mist. However, his hair is slicked back, coated with "Stankang." He is also dressed in the latest fashion: a Western-style suit, patent leather shoes, and baggy trousers. Yet, what cannot be concealed are the ribs showing on his chest and his legs as thin as firewood. He, too, has his capital: money. A car speeds down the long road, carrying these two corpses. The cat-faced woman rests her head on the man's thin shoulder, uttering a delicate voice:</p>
<p>"Take me back to school."</p>
<p>The man remains silent, turning his face to smile at her, a tender electric current conveyed in his eyes, first pleading, then commanding. The woman is delighted, extending her right arm to embrace his neck, pressing her face even closer. A tall five-story building, a hotel for travelers. A porter in a neat uniform leads them to a room, inside which are a Siemens bed, a sofa, a dressing table, a full-length mirror, and a bathroom. Collapsing onto the sofa, the man's bones and flesh are already a little numb, his face flushed. The woman pretends to be frightened, but in her heart, she is indeed calm.</p>
<p>The lights are extinguished; people become even more like beasts, and the beasts revel, their youthful energy leading to deathly exhaustion. Everything is at rest; the sound of hurried breathing and the acrid smell of sweat are no longer heard.</p>
<p>People become beasts; beasts become corpses!</p>
<p>Dawn peeks out; the sun slowly rises from the east, beginning another day. The daytime does not belong to them; it is precisely their time for sweet sleep.</p>
<p>Night is his world; night is the world of animalistic desires; night is the world of demons.</p>
<h3>Regarding Chinese Literature</h3>
<p>— Yu Mutao</p>
<p>Mr. Zhao: You have changed your tune; you have changed and practically admitted that your previous slanders against me were mere clippings and pastings. Now, you say that I "have written something." However, you say I write incorrectly. Now, to save space, I will simply answer you with a few points. (1) The reason why the Han dynasty produced fu (rhapsodies): please read pages 33 to 37 and page 138, line 10 of my humble compilation. It was originally a method of responding to the circumstances.</p>
<p>(2) The reason why the writers of the Wei and Jin dynasties were pessimistic: you say I copied you. You are really trying to overreach yourself. Here is a comparison:</p>
<p>Zhao: "People in the Jin dynasty loved pure conversation and studied Laozi and Zhuangzi. Men of letters were naturally no exception. Therefore, apart from the heroic Liu Kun, almost no Jin dynasty literary figure had a pessimistic attitude towards life." (A Brief History, p. 25)</p>
<p>Yu: "The Jin dynasty inherited the works of the Han and Wei dynasties. Its initial form of government naturally had to accommodate the peasants, or rather, the peasant wars of that time buried a large number of peasants. Otherwise, the Yellow Turbans, which had been stirred up during the reign of Emperor Xian of Han and continued through the Wei dynasty, could not have been suppressed… The Jin dynasty never resolved the peasant problem. After seizing power from the Wei dynasty, it established itself on the foundation of appeasing the imperial clan. By the time of Emperor Hui, most of the common people were already helpless, and Emperor Hui was extraordinarily foolish. At this time, the impoverished masses of people, the peasants, naturally revolted again as they had in previous dynasties. At the same time, the barbarians of the north took advantage of China's internal troubles, namely the Rebellion of the Eight Princes of the Jin dynasty, and led troops south. This was truly like Rome in the fifth century. Because society was so turbulent and unstable, both the court and the common people were accustomed to pessimism…" (My humble compilation, pp. 47, 48, 49).</p>
<p>Even if you flipped through your old book until it was tattered, you wouldn't find my "shallow" analysis.</p>
<p>(3) The Yuan drama was not due to the special development of commercial capital. For this point, you can refer to the reasons for the development of Greek tragedy in my humble compilation, pages 17 to 18. The words quoted from Zang Jinshu are only used to prove that the developmental paths of Eastern and Western dramas are the same.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the reasons for the emergence of the Ming and Qing chapter-based novels: you say that my "citation" of notes from Qing and modern people is not your "original idea." This is enough to show that your writing on the 21st about my "paper-pasting technique" and "literary clipping public" were all slanders. You said I don't read books, but only clip and paste. Yet now you say I "cite." This is truly a clumsy (writing) scribe repeatedly showing his true colors. As for "original ideas," I would never dare to think of them, because all things in the world exist relatively, subjectively, and objectively.</p>
<p>(5) You say, "The Song dynasty had zaju (variety plays) and chuanqi (romances), which can be called a great discovery in literary history! The Yuan dynasty also had chuanqi, which was equally ridiculous!" Sir, you should read more books and stop talking nonsense. The Song dynasty had zaju. Just check page 303, lines 8 and 9 of Zheng's "Outline of Literature":</p>
<p>"The 'History of the Song Dynasty: Music' states: 'Emperor Zhenzong did not like Zheng music but sometimes wrote zaju lyrics, which he never announced to the outside world.' Su Shi's poem says: 'Staging old events, bringing out ghosts and demons.'"</p>
<p>The Song dynasty had chuanqi. Please see Lu's "A Brief History of Chinese Fiction," page 127, from the first line onward:</p>
<p>"There were also authors of chuanqi prose. What is now falsely attributed to Tang people, 'Biography of Green Pearl,' one volume, and 'Outer Biography of Yang Taizhen,' one volume, were written by Song musician Yue Shi… "</p>
<p>The Yuan dynasty also had chuanqi. The term "chuanqi" originally continued to use the old name. In fact, it is what Lu Ben called "simulated vernacular stories," such as "Remnants of the Xuanhe Era of the Great Song." For an explanation of "simulated vernacular stories," refer to page 416 of Zheng's compilation.</p>
<p>Sir, the above rough outline should be enough to silence your golden mouth.</p>
<p>In the future, if there is time and space, I will open a list of the things you have copied from Mr. Xie Wuliang, Mr. Hu Shih, Mr. Gu Jiegang, etc. This is my reply, and I wish you good health in the summer.</p>
<h3>Ordinary Matters (21)</h3>
<p>— Dan Guosun</p>
<p>Representative Qiu said, "Ah!" and lowered his head in silence. Zhi Guang continued to walk northwest. They only sought to reach their destination as quickly as possible, steeling their hearts and disregarding all the sounds around them. So, in reality, it was just walking fast, walking fast. Just as they saw the large bamboo enclosures near Chenjia Village, the "Jia Wu Qu" front line in Zhabei suddenly came to life, step by step. These were definitely not isolated gunshots and grenade explosions. They were coming closer and closer, mixed with the rat-a-tat-tat of machine guns and the bang-bang-bang of mortars. Every time there was a boom, Zhi Guang felt the ground vibrate.</p>
<p>They couldn't help but raise their bitter faces and glance eastward, but their legs still headed towards Chenjia Village… forward… forward… forward… Finally, after no more than ten or twenty minutes, they arrived at the village of Lijia Village. In the bamboo garden outside the village, seven or eight children were lying, all looking up idly at the planes that had already turned from south to north. Calling Chenjia Village a village was perhaps for the sake of convenience. Because in terms of its layout, it was no more than twenty dilapidated and short houses, arranged very untidily along a small stream (small bay) lined with bamboo trees. If you were to use northern terminology, it was simply half of a "large courtyard"—as if only the row of houses facing the bay had been built at the time. In this way, the empty space between the small bay and the houses naturally formed a deformed courtyard. Everything in this courtyard, except for those half-yellow, half-green bamboos, whether it was the walls, the soil, the trees, the scattered utensils left behind, the long and short clothes drying under the trees, and the stones placed on the ground for various uses, was almost all gray-black, fully conveying the atmosphere of decline.</p>
<p>The sound of Zhi Guang and Representative Qiu's footsteps broke the silence of the courtyard, and immediately two or three dogs sleeping by the door raised their heads and barked a few times, characteristically of the animals of Jiangnan. Two soldiers came out of the main door of one of the houses, and after exchanging glances, they all walked towards the door.</p>

<h3>Cotton Grading and Production-Marketing Cooperation - Di Fuyu</h3>
<p>I. Introductory Remarks</p>
<p>Revitalizing agriculture and improving production are the most urgent tasks for our country at present. There are thousands of ways to provide relief, but promoting cotton production and marketing cooperation is the most convenient and essential. Cotton occupies the primary position in the world's commodities, and daily life is indispensable to it. However, due to the differences in variety, climate, soil, and preparation methods, its quality varies accordingly. Therefore, European and American countries have long had grade standards for cotton to rectify cotton production and develop the cotton industry. Egyptian cotton, American upland cotton, and sea island cotton, etc., are known for their excellent quality. Our country's cotton industry is still in its infancy, and there is no promotion of grade standards in commerce, resulting in cotton transactions lacking order. Cotton merchants engage in buying and selling, often leading to monopoly, oppression, manipulation, and fraud, prioritizing their own interests and causing no small amount of harm to cotton production. Good cotton often does not receive a fair price and is thus buried, while inferior cotton is everywhere. We have no choice but to import foreign cotton as a supplement. Even factories that specialize in spinning fine yarns have completely adopted foreign cotton, while domestic cotton is disdained. The future is precarious. For the sake of improving cotton production, both production and marketing parties should have genuine cooperation, and cotton grading is the prerequisite issue in cooperation. The textile industry should have deep awareness and long-term vision to support the promotion of cotton grading. At present, they should have a slight determination to sacrifice. The price increase for high-quality cotton should be higher than normal. In fact, once cotton is graded, its use in textiles is greatly enhanced. Because of its pure quality and uniform cotton fibers, it is convenient to spin any kind of yarn, suitable for any grade of goods, and there is less unnecessary waste. In terms of production, because there is a grade standard to guarantee good cotton, farmers can obtain the benefit of price increases, and cotton farmers will naturally be happy to plant good cotton and increase production. Therefore, cotton grading is also sufficient to provide relief to rural areas and increase commodity prices. It is indeed a win-win situation for both production and marketing.</p>
<p>II. Overview of China's Cotton Grade Standards</p>
<p>Our country has never had regulations for cotton grade standards. Most cotton merchants do not know what grade is. The Chinese Cotton and Cloth Exchange also has its cotton grade table, but unfortunately, its method is still simple. It only uses the place names of various regions as the standard, which is only convenient for buying, selling, and delivering futures on the exchange, or perhaps not even that. It is far from the cotton grade standards set by the United States for spot and futures purchases, which are so-called classified, rewarding the good and demeaning the bad. In view of this, the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau has assigned personnel to study cotton grading for many years. It has adopted the method of the U.S. Department of Agriculture for manufacturing cotton grade standards and has purchased various grade standards from the U.S. Department of Agriculture for reference. The United States is the largest cotton market in the world, and its grades are generally accepted by the world. Moreover, the propagation of American cotton in our country is increasing year by year, so our country's cotton grading should follow the American grading method even more. The research method is to collect cotton samples from various regions and conduct experiments to identify the grades. As a result, the national cotton production is planned comprehensively, and standard samples are tentatively set under the same theory, with categories and grades to change various commercial observations, eliminate each party's one-sided views, and have actual specimens placed in grade boxes for comparison. The category standard is due to the different cotton species in our country, and the quality varies greatly. They cannot be listed under the same grade standard, so they are divided into five categories:</p>
<p>(1) Long-staple American cotton grade standard, (2) Short-staple American cotton grade standard, (3) Black-seed Chinese cotton grade standard, (4) White-seed Chinese cotton grade standard, (5) Special hard velvet grade standard.</p>
<p>As for the grade, no matter what kind of standard, the same observation is taken. Generally, there are five grades, namely the first grade, the superior grade, the second grade, the upper grade, the third grade, the medium grade, the fourth grade, the lower grade, and the fifth grade, the inferior grade. If difficulties arise during grading, a half grade is attached. The grading conditions must be under special light, depending on the color tone, the amount of impurities, and the quality of the ginning to determine the grade. The cotton of the superior grade generally needs to have a bright and silky color, the cotton fibers are neat and clean, the ginning is good, and there are a few seed husks. The degree of upper-grade cotton is second to the superior grade and above the medium grade. Medium-grade cotton, on the other hand, has quite a few spots affected by the climate, such as yellow, gray, and light dyes, with more attachments. However, it does not tend to be dark. The ginning is ordinary, and the fiber clumps have quite a few leaves, seed husks, and shells. The lower-grade cotton has a dull white color, slightly grayish, and various stains are quite obvious, making the cotton sample appear unclean. There are more leaves, seed husks, shell cotton seeds, and broken cotton fibers and clumps are found. The degree of the inferior grade is lower than the lower grade. In addition, the length of the cotton fibers also has certain regulations, and whether the cotton fibers are neat and their strength are also included. Recently, the bureau has also tentatively set cotton grade standard price increases and decreases, so that the cotton produced in various parts of our country can be priced according to the grade and have a corresponding value. For example, for the same American species, Baocheng cotton, Tianjin cotton, Shandong cotton, etc., which have a high grade and length, should be able to obtain the benefit of price increases. If Hankou cotton, Shashi cotton, etc., have low grades and lengths, they must be subject to considerable price reductions. However, so-called superior cotton is not necessarily of the best grade, and Hankou cotton is not necessarily all inferior. In short, the degree of cotton in various regions is not the same. The length also varies. It must be increased or decreased according to the grade to obtain the actual value of the cotton and correct the error of only knowing to use the place name as the standard. The benefits gained from this are immeasurable. A few are listed below: (1) Facilitate cotton product buying and selling procedures, (2) Handle cotton cargo disputes and negotiations, (3) Increase merchant cotton quality, (4) Promote cotton farmers' cotton-picking interest, (5) Prevent fraudulent merchants and inferior farmers from cheating, (6) Assist in the promotion of cotton areas, (7) Promote progress in yarn cargo, (8) Reduce losses in the textile industry.</p>
<p>III. Plan for Promoting Cotton Grading</p>
<p>Cotton grading in our country is a pioneering effort. Although the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau has tentatively finalized it, it is not possible to promote this grade nationwide unless the cotton industry attaches importance to grading. The government should not promote it directly. It is necessary to rely on the efforts of the industry itself. It is necessary to have a plan for cotton grading on the basis of cooperation. What is the plan? It is to carry out grading in the cotton producing area. Currently, the cotton on the market is simply mixed by cotton merchants. If you want to inspect each package when you sample, it is not allowed. The only way for consumers to obtain good cotton is to cooperate with producers and carry out cotton grading in the original producing area. However, with the undeveloped public intelligence, it is troublesome and expensive for textile factories to send personnel to the cotton-producing areas to buy cotton and carry out grading. It is only possible to use experienced graders to handle the matter. Although there is a shortage of such talents at present, it is possible to conduct appropriate training in advance. On the one hand, it is necessary to cooperate with well-run cooperative farms. On the consumer side, it is also necessary to establish cooperatives. Effective cooperation between production and marketing parties can achieve the desired results. A plan is proposed below:</p>
<p>(1) Select a few major cotton-producing areas and pure-variety areas to hold first. For example, western Hunan, Yuyao in Zhejiang, , Xian in Shaanxi, etc., are all quite suitable. It is easier to handle if there are cooperative farms in various places. (2) Train graders. Recruit six to eight graduates from agricultural colleges or high school graduates and send them to the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau for appropriate training for at least three months. After the training period, they will be responsible for grading cotton in the original producing area. (3) Business. (A) Cooperate with consumers. Cotton grading is an important measure to improve cotton production and is a pioneering effort in our country. Therefore, before carrying out cotton grading, contracts should be signed with various textile manufacturers in advance to designate a basic grade. For example, the price should be increased by a certain amount if it is one grade higher or above one grade than the basic grade. The price should be reduced by a certain amount if it is one grade lower or below one grade than the basic grade. The price of cotton fibers should also be increased or decreased according to their length. The difference in increase or decrease can be proportional to the value of each grade increase or decrease in the American cotton standard, or a method can be publicly agreed upon. Although the moisture content of cotton is not within the grade standard conditions, both production and marketing parties should also set it separately. For example, if 12% is taken as the standard (9% can be taken as the standard in Henan and Shaanxi provinces), then for every pound exceeding 12%, it should be deducted from the cotton price according to the amount, and for every pound less than 12%, it should be added to the cotton price to show fairness. This will prevent those who are accustomed to adding water from using their skills, and the problem of adding water can be eliminated. The cotton fiber uniformity rate must be set at 88% or more to be considered qualified. If it is less than 88%, its value should also be reduced, and the strength of the cotton fibers is also included. (B) Cooperate with producers. Cotton farmers or merchants in our country do not know what cotton grade is. Therefore, those who carry out cotton grading should promote and publicize it and guide them on how to promote cotton products, how to select them, ensure the quality is uniform, and the grades are correct. The superior should be rewarded and the inferior should be devalued so that the quality of the cotton can have a corresponding value. However, this work is extremely difficult. If there are cooperative farms or local authorities in various places, it will be easier to carry out. (C) Imitate cotton grade standards. Cotton grading is valuable in having actual specimens for comparison. Therefore, it is necessary to collect cotton samples from various regions, distinguish the grades, and imitate the cotton grade standards of our country tentatively set by the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau to manufacture several sets. Each of the production and marketing parties has a set or several sets of specimens for comparison when grading cotton. (D) Grading procedures. The grader should carry out grading in the cotton producing area before packing (referring to machine packing). Based on the experience of trained graders and according to the cotton grade identification method, the grade is identified under special light by inspecting the color tone, the quality of ginning, and the amount of impurities. It is also necessary to test the variety, length, etc., and then batch and prepare them separately before packing. When packing, each package must be equipped with the same small package with the same number as the large package to avoid the trouble of unpacking the large package during sampling and re-inspection. However, the grader or cooperative farm must be absolutely responsible for this small package. The category, grade, length, grader's name, and other items should be indicated on each cotton package, and the daily grading situation should be recorded in a table for reporting. Some of the graded cotton samples should be retained for the manufacture of specimens. (E) Organize a review committee. After the cotton grading is carried out in the original producing area, the cotton is loaded to the predetermined factory according to the contract. The factory can apply to the local inspection bureau for re-inspection. The certificate issued by the inspection bureau shall be used as the basis. If there are still objections between the production and marketing parties, a review committee can be organized, with at least five people: three from the bureau and one each from the production and marketing parties. It can be decided with the consent of more than three people. In short, although the grade level of cotton produced in various regions is different, the grading theory is the same. Placing the national cotton production under the same theory will avoid each party's stubbornness. If there are prejudices, what are the benefits to marketing? (F) Publicity and promotion. For the publicity method, several types of brochures must be pre-printed and distributed to cotton farmers and merchants, detailing the benefits of grading and the harm of cheating. After the grading business has been carried out effectively, it will be promoted to various places.</p>
<p>IV. Conclusion</p>
<p>Cotton farmers, cotton merchants, textile merchants, and large and small import and export merchants in European and American countries almost know the cotton grade standards, and the United States is even more detailed. Cotton markets have licensed graders to identify grades. Therefore, the yield is abundant, the quality is excellent, and its sales are as smooth as mercury pouring on the ground, penetrating every pore. Looking back at our country's cotton industry, it is lifeless and lacks a new spirit of revitalization. Cotton farmers, cotton merchants, and textile factories all value their own interests. They cannot communicate with each other. Therefore, cotton farmers have no interest in improving cotton varieties and selecting cotton flowers because good cotton does not have a higher price. Cotton merchants oppress cotton farmers and do their best to manipulate them. The cunning ones disregard everything, mix impurities, and achieve their own selfish goals, causing various losses to textile factories. Textile factories also mostly only care about their own interests, benefit from what they have and do not do good, and are unwilling to pay a higher price for good cotton. When cotton prices fall, they often peach other, and the killing. The inspection of goods is not appropriate, or the road is received, and there are more cotton merchants. Therefore, the improvement of cotton production is finally in commerce. In view of this, it is a must to implement the cotton score and implement the cotton industry, or the move. It is enough to help the rural areas and improve the value of cotton products, and it can also promote the promotion of cotton fields. Subject to its increase, the lack of cotton production will be resolved and decided.</p>
<h3>The Decline of the Homespun Industry and Its Relief by Wang Xin</h3>
<p>1.  Homespun Industry and the Farmers' Economy in Our Country</p>
<p>It is commonly known that homespun cloth production is a sideline for farmers. Farming and weaving are the main tasks of farmers. Farming is the primary occupation, and weaving is the secondary occupation, referring to homespun cloth. Farmers work at sunrise and rest at sunset. Their ability to support their families and meet their needs depends on farming and weaving. Therefore, homespun cloth is closely related to the farmers' economy. In recent years, the rural economy has been in decline. The reasons are not limited to one aspect, but the decline of farming and weaving is a major key. There are many reasons for the decline of farming and weaving, mainly due to natural disasters, man-made calamities, and economic aggression. With such a decline in farming and weaving, if this continues, it is unlikely that the rural economy will not face total bankruptcy.</p>
<p>2.  Production and Sales of Homespun Cloth and Its Merchant Guilds</p>
<p>The production and sales areas of homespun cloth in our country are extensive, covering both domestic and international regions. In terms of production areas, Jiangsu Province includes Wujin, Changshu, Jiangyin, Chongming, Qidong, Tongzhou, Shanghai, Chuansha, Nanhui, Jiading, and other places. Zhejiang Province includes Pinghu, Haiyan (including Xiashi), Wangdian, Xinchang, Xintai, and other places. In terms of sales areas, there are Guangdong, Guangxi, Nanyang Islands, Singapore, Penang, Malacca, Little Luzon, Java, as well as Fujian, Anhui, Shandong, and the three northeastern provinces.</p>
<p>Homespun cloth produced in Tongzhou, Chongming, and Hai'an is called Shabu. Homespun cloth produced in Pudong, Shanghai, is called Taobu. Homespun cloth produced in the western suburbs of Shanghai is called Qingshui cloth. Although the names of homespun cloth produced in different places vary, broadly speaking, there are only two types: blue cloth and white cloth. The merchant guilds engaged in the homespun cloth industry are divided into four groups: Shanghai, Changshu, Chongming, and Tongzhou. The Shanghai group has the largest influence and specializes in blue cloth, while the Chongming and Changshu groups specialize in white cloth. Taking Shanghai as an example, there are over twenty stores engaged in the homespun cloth industry in the city. The largest ones have a capital of 10,000 yuan, accounting for 20% of the total. The smallest ones have a capital of 2,000 yuan, also accounting for 20% of the total. The average is about 6,000 yuan, accounting for 60% of the total. The largest annual turnover is 500,000 yuan, the average is 300,000 yuan, and the smallest is 30,000 yuan.</p>
<p>3.  The Decline of the Homespun Industry and Its Causes</p>
<p>The decline of the homespun industry has reached its peak today. In terms of quantity, the annual sales volume of Taobu and Qingshui cloth in Shanghai before the tenth year of the Republic of China reached 300,000 bales. In the past three to five years, it has decreased to 10,000 bales. The annual sales volume of homespun cloth from Tongzhou, Chongming, and other regions before the fifteenth year of the Republic of China was over 200,000 bales, but in the past four to five years, it has decreased to 110,000 to 120,000 bales. The extent of the decline is evident. In terms of price, sixteen pieces of Liuyang summer cloth cost fifty taels last year, but forty-nine yuan this year. One hundred pieces of Mao homespun cloth cost 192 taels last year, but 260 yuan this year. Tongzhou large-size cloth cost 35 taels and 6 qian last year, but 46 yuan and 5 jiao this year. Medium-size cloth cost 96 taels last year, but 119 yuan this year. Silver gray cloth cost 140 taels last year, but 200 yuan this year. Jing cloth cost 156 taels last year, but 203 yuan this year. In total, sales volume has decreased by ninety percent, while the selling price has decreased by ten percent.</p>
<p>What are the causes of the decline of the homespun industry? Let us briefly describe them: First, the crude manufacturing of homespun cloth. The homespun cloth industry sticks to old methods and does not seek progress. The selling price is high, and the quality is poor. In this case, how can it compete with foreign cloth in the business arena? Second, the influx of foreign cloth. The import of foreign cloth is a fatal blow to the homespun cloth industry. The Chinese people are happy to purchase foreign cloth because of its low price and good quality. The wider the sales of foreign cloth, the more the homespun cloth declines. Third, the fall of the three northeastern provinces. The three northeastern provinces were originally a large sales market for homespun cloth. Since the loss of the northeastern provinces, the great market has been swept away by Japanese cloth. The impact on the sales of homespun cloth is enormous. Fourth, the decline of farmers' purchasing power. In recent years, the rural economy has deteriorated, and farmers' purchasing power has declined daily. The homespun cloth industry has lost its main customer base, and thus shows signs of decline. Fifth, the decline of overseas trade. In recent years, overseas trade has been quite sluggish, such as the rubber industry in Nanyang, which is one example. This has also had a significant impact on overseas operators of homespun cloth.</p>
<p>4.  Relief Plan for the Homespun Industry</p>
<p>The decline of the homespun industry is such, and its relationship with the farmers' economy is such. Therefore, we should seek ways to help it. Let us briefly describe one: First, increase the length and width of homespun cloth. The biggest drawback of homespun cloth is that its size is too narrow. Gaoyang County in Hebei Province first used private efforts to persuade farmers to change to the manufacturing method of factory cloth. To this day, the annual output has reached several million yuan. Almost all provinces in the north know the name of Gaoyang cloth. Recently, the Nantong Farmers' Education Museum has improved the local homespun cloth, and it has been effective. The width has increased to two feet and two inches, and the length has increased to seven feet and two inches. Each piece has a lot of profit. It is enough to show that increasing the length and width of homespun cloth is indeed an urgent task. Second, improve the colors and patterns of homespun cloth. After the length and width of homespun cloth have been increased, it is necessary to improve the colors and patterns to make it more beautiful. Nantong homespun cloth, in addition to increasing the length and width, has also been improved in color and pattern, so it is no different from factory cloth. Third, promote the machine weaving of homespun cloth. Machine weaving has many benefits. To mention the most important ones, it can increase production, reduce costs, and improve quality. The low price and good quality of Japanese cloth are also due to its machine weaving. Therefore, if we want to thoroughly improve our country's homespun cloth, we must promote machine weaving. Fourth, reduce the selling price of homespun cloth. After the homespun cloth has been improved, we should strive for a lower selling price. In recent business, there is a new trend, which is the so-called "small profit, large sales" principle. Do not seek high prices and small sales, but seek small profits and large sales.</p>
<p>The reason is that if the selling price is high and sales are reduced, the profit will be small. Conversely, if the selling price is low and sales are increased, the profit will be large. This is something we must know. The above points are only from the perspective of homespun cloth itself. If we can follow this and work hard, although we dare not say that there will be any great results, at least it will be enough to save the homespun cloth industry from decline. This can be asserted. I humbly believe that the decline of homespun cloth is greatly related to the prosperity and decline of our country's national economy. Therefore, I dare to contribute my humble opinion for discussion by enthusiastic people in the community.</p>
<h3>Qiu Guangting on the Key to Reviving the Cotton Industry</h3>
<p>After reading the customs report, I sighed and said, "In the past twenty years, some cotton goods imports have increased from less to more, while others have decreased from more to less. More than less means that domestic production is low and cannot meet consumer demand, so it is taken from foreign countries. Less than more means that domestic production is gradually increasing, and the production can meet the needs, gradually eliminating the need for foreign demand. Furthermore, if the import of goods is less than in the past, it is evidence of the gradual rise of industry. If it is more than in the past, it is a sign of agricultural decline. Cotton cloth imports gradually increased until the eighth year of the Republic of China. Before that, there was still hand-woven homespun cloth to meet the sales. At this point, it gradually tended to be eliminated. In the past three years, the volume of cotton cloth imports has gradually decreased from its peak. One reason is the weak purchasing power of the rural areas, and the other is the gradual increase in domestic looms. As production increases, imports naturally decrease. As for cotton yarn, it has gradually decreased since the tenth year of the Republic of China, and now it is only one-eighth of what it was before the tenth year of the Republic of China. This is clear evidence of the gradual increase in domestic and foreign yarn mills and spindles. The most alarming thing, which has had the most serious impact on the rural economy, is the import of cotton. From more than 200,000 dan before the eighth year of the Republic of China, it increased to more than 4.6 million dan in the twentieth year, with a value of more than 17.9 million taels in customs dollars. In the most recent three years, an average of more than 3.5 million dan of raw cotton has been imported each year, and more than 140 million taels of silver have flowed out. The reason is that the quantity is insufficient and the quality does not meet the needs of modern textile engineering. As human culture progresses, the need for textiles also progresses from coarse to fine. The short, coarse fibers of Chinese cotton cannot be used to make fine yarn and cloth, so its use is decreasing day by day. Human desires cannot return from culture to quality, that is, they cannot ban fine cloth and insist on using coarse cloth. Therefore, to stop the import of foreign cotton, we must find a way to improve the quality of raw cotton and increase the quantity. Unfortunately, the country has been in turmoil, and the government has not been able to devote itself to improving internal affairs and promoting production. Fortunately, the Executive Yuan has established a Rural Revival Committee, and the American cotton and wheat loans have also allocated a part to improve agricultural production, including cotton.</p>
<p>The China Cotton Production Improvement Association is the only group in our country that improves cotton production. Its members are all skilled in cotton cultivation knowledge and have the ambition to improve cotton production. After the second annual meeting, they will definitely implement the resolutions one by one, so that the fine, long-staple, and white raw cotton will no longer depend on others, and the rural areas will have the hope of revival.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Social Economy of Beiping (Continued) by Cheng Wen'ai</h3>
<p>3.  The Situation of Commerce</p>
<p>Because Beiping is not a treaty port, the commerce of the entire city is generally not very prosperous. However, two types of businesses are relatively developed. The first is related to "eating". It seems that the residents of Beiping are particular about eating, so the restaurant industry is particularly developed. The second is related to "playing". It seems that the residents of Beiping are fond of Peking Opera, so the theaters are also particularly developed. In addition, fur and leather goods occupy an important position in Beiping's commerce. As for the commodity market, Japanese goods account for more than 80%, while genuine domestic goods are rarely seen. This is an undeniable fact. As reported in the newspapers, Japanese goods are widely sold in our country's market, especially in North China. As for the financial industry, Xiheyan is the center of financial transactions, because all banks gather here. Dazhalan can be said to be the center of clothing. Liulichang can be said to be the center of the bookstore industry. Wangfujing Street can be said to be the center of the new-style department store industry, because the opening of the Zhongyuan Company has attracted the attention of many Beiping modern men and women. Nearby is the Dong'an Market, which is the only department store market in Beiping, mostly focusing on "eating" and "wearing". In addition, Xidan is also prosperous. Tianqiao Market is said to be the only place for the public to entertain and relax in Beiping, but except for the unemployed workers, retired soldiers, working masses, and small businessmen, modern men and women rarely visit. In addition, there are many peddlers in Beiping who gather at the market during festivals, such as the Longfusi market on the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th days of the lunar month; the Huguosi market on the 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th days; the Baitasi market on the 5th and 6th days; the Tudimiao market on the 3rd day; the Huabaishi market on the 4th day; and the Dongyue Miao market on the 1st and 15th days. All of the above are calculated according to the Gregorian calendar. Although Beiping's general commerce has a characteristic of lacking speculative trading, its shortcomings are that it sticks to old rules and regulations.</p>
<p>4.  An Anatomy of the Financial World</p>
<p>Beiping's financial world is also divided into new and old factions. The new faction is the banking industry, and the old faction is the money shop industry. Each has its own guild. However, Beiping's money shop industry does not have the great influence in the financial world that Shanghai's money shop industry has. Beiping's financial world is completely manipulated by the banking industry. According to the Beiping Banking Association, which was established in the ninth year of the Republic of China, it had more than thirty members at most, but now there are only eleven remaining. They are divided into three classes: Bank of China, Beiyang Baoshang Bank, Bank of Communications, Continental Bank, Yanye Bank, Zhongfu Bank, Xinhua Trust and Savings Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Jin Cheng Bank, China Agricultural and Industrial Bank, and China Industrial Bank.</p>
<p>The current chairman of the Banking Association belongs to Jin Cheng Bank. Among the members, the banks that issue banknotes are the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Xinhua, China Industrial, Beiyang Baoshang, and China Industrial six banks. However, the Yanye Bank, Jin Cheng Bank, and Continental Bank also secretly issue banknotes. Only Zhongfu and Zhejiang Industrial Banks do not issue banknotes. As for the issuance of subsidiary coin coupons, there is the China Agricultural and Industrial Bank. In addition, the Hebei Provincial Bank, which has not joined the association, also issues subsidiary coin coupons. The Beiping Municipal Money Shop Association currently has thirty-two members, listed as follows:</p>
<p>Hebei Money Shop, Yu Daheng Money Shop, Jichang Money Shop, Hong Mao Yuan Money Shop, Tongde Money Shop, Dunchang Money Shop, Yongtai Money Shop, Baosheng Money Shop, Yong Zenghe Money Shop, Jiyuan Money Shop, Yongyuan Money Shop, Yi Bo Money Shop, Fuhua Bank Shop, Huichang Money Shop, Mingde Money Shop, Tongsheng Money Shop, Taikang Money Shop, Yuanmao Money Shop, Qianhetai Money Shop, Shengheng Money Shop, Chunhuamao Money Shop, Yuantonghou Money Shop, Yisheng Money Shop, Puyi Money Shop, Yiheng Money Shop, Tongji Money Shop, Zhanyou Money Shop, Qianhetai West Shop, Zhengyang Money Shop, Yongtong Money Shop, Tongshang Money Shop, Tongcheng Money Shop.</p>
<p>The chairman of the executive committee belongs to the Hebei Money Shop. According to the Hebei Money Shop, it was established by Hebei Province with a capital of 200,000 yuan, actually paid up 120,000 yuan. It issues copper coin notes, divided into twenty, forty, fifty, sixty, and one hundred coins, and five jiao. It circulates throughout the province, but the ones that circulate on the market are limited to Beiping City. In addition to the Hebei Money Shop, the capital is mostly from 2,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan. Some are jointly established, but all bear unlimited liability. The Money Shop Association also has a commercial news section.</p>
<h3>Financial Sunday: Foreign Exchange Even Quieter</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday again, and the banks were closed as usual. All kinds of receipts and transactions were mostly suspended. Money shops still operated as usual, but it was far less prosperous than usual. In the market, the foreign exchange interbank lending rate was still 0.05 in the morning and afternoon. The volume of interbank lending transactions in the morning market was over 4.2 million, with new transactions exceeding 100,000. The volume of transactions in the afternoon market was over 300,000. The volume of transactions in the Small General Association was over 400,000. The amount of foreign public notes received by the money shops was over 24 million. The amount of remittances from various routes was over 300,000. The amount of foreign exchange loans made by the money shops was 300,000 to 400,000. The amount of new currency shipped from other ports was 330,000. The price of subsidiary coins, such as Jiangnan small silver coins, was still 842 yuan in the morning and afternoon markets. The volume of transactions was 5,000 jiao in the morning market and 4,500 jiao in the afternoon market. The price of Guangdong small silver coins was 773.8 yuan in the morning market and 774 yuan in the afternoon market. The volume of transactions was 35,000 jiao in the morning market and 25,000 jiao in the afternoon market. The price of copper coins plus length was 500 wen, for a total of 317,500 wen. The volume of transactions was 39,670 strings, with a total value of 12,500 yuan in foreign exchange.</p>

<h3>Securities: Public Bonds Fluctuated Greatly Last Week</h3>
<p>Rising repeatedly at the beginning of the week due to new demand</p>
<p>Followed by rumors and long positions closing out</p>
<p>Strong rebound at the end of the week due to short covering</p>
<p>From the 17th to the 22nd of last week (July), the market of the China Business Securities Exchange was still very active. Since the change to half-day trading, the volume of transactions has been quite smooth, due to the large amount of deposits and the approaching July delivery date. There was also new demand in the market, and the volume of transactions increased frequently, with large fluctuations. The collapse of the negotiations and the inevitability of military force, coupled with the ambiguous loan from the British, caused the bond market price to fluctuate with the strength of people's sentiment. However, due to the delivery relationship, the price may be affected by the supply and demand of the trading codes. Monday was relatively chaotic. Although there were long positions closing out, the market price was mixed, with a difference of about 0.3 yuan, because the demand for the 4th coupon was higher. On Tuesday, a certain Confucian society suddenly had new demand, and the market price turned to a peak again. The prices of all bonds reached new highs, with increases ranging from several jiao to 1.2-1.3 yuan. The opening on Wednesday was slightly squeezed by short positions, and the market price rose again, reaching new highs. The salt tax was close to 56 yuan, the demobilization bond was 69.2 yuan, and the 1926 bond was 60 yuan, which was an excellent situation and could be called a golden age. The second session saw a slight decline. On Thursday, because the negotiations were about to break down and the loan from the British seemed hopeless, various groups sold off, and the market price fell back by 0.3-0.4 yuan to 0.8 yuan. The Jin Chang bond fell slightly by about 1 yuan. On Friday, there were the most unfounded rumors, and people's hearts gradually became agitated. Many long positions closed out, and the market price fell continuously, with a decrease ranging from a few jiao to more than 2 yuan. On Saturday, short positions covered, and a sudden rebound occurred, with a strong increase ranging from 0.3-0.4 yuan to more than 1 yuan. As a result of the week's market price, except for the 1918 customs bond, which rose slightly by 0.15 yuan, and the salt tax, which remained firm, the rest were all slightly lower than the previous week, with a decrease ranging from 0.2-0.3 yuan to about 1 yuan. Looking at the overall situation of the week, the short positions of the demobilization bond seemed to be gradually decreasing, and many people exchanged the 1919 bond for the 1919 welfare bond. There were many long positions in the 20-roll 20-customs bond. The long and short positions of the unified salt tax were comparable. There were more people buying the 1926 bond and the Jin Chang bond. The 1996 bond was gradually becoming cold. The Jin short bond was newly listed, and few people asked about it. There are still two days left before the delivery, and there may still be fluctuations. The total number of transactions was 65,880,300 yuan, including 50,300 yuan in cash. The total amount of futures trading in unified salt tax was 21,930,000 yuan, demobilization bond accounted for 8,010,000 yuan, 1919 welfare bond accounted for 8,430,000 yuan, 20-roll 20-customs bond accounted for 11,870,000 yuan, 1996 bond accounted for 5,380,000 yuan, 1918 customs bond accounted for 4,430,000 yuan, and the rest accounted for only several hundred thousand.</p>
<h3>Yarn, Cotton, American Cotton Plunges, Small Rebound</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was mixed. It rose first due to good news from Liverpool, and then fell due to long positions closing out. As a result, the spot price rose by 10 points, and the futures price rose by 3-14 points. The Liverpool cotton market spot price fell by 11 points, and the futures price fell by 10 points. The Egyptian cotton spot price fell by 8 points. The Bombay cotton market initially fell with the American cotton, but then rebounded as short positions took profits and covered.

<h3>Grain and Food: Rice Prices at Xiahe Still Slightly Lower</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than 30 sources of supply, but initially only movement within the street, and the situation suddenly showed signs of softness. Near noon, Tianjin merchants saw the market price declining, and suddenly took action, buying one boatload of thin rice at a slightly lower price, one boatload of Sijing rice, and three boatloads of Songjiang rice, totaling six or seven hundred bags. The prices were opened with Qing Sijing rice at 7.2 yuan, and Songjiang rice at 7.18-7.05 yuan. At that time, the sellers took the opportunity to tighten the market, and the situation seemed to be rebounding. However, once the Tianjin merchants saw the market turning firm, they immediately stopped. Therefore, the result was not overly optimistic, and the prices of various types of rice, such as thick rice, thin rice, and Du Yangjian, were still slightly lower. Due to the lack of goods, there was no market for transformed silver dollars.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, about ten boats arrived from various gangs in Xiahe. Bai Geng rice was still stagnant, and the market price was reduced by another 0.1 yuan. Early thin rice was slightly weak, and high-quality Yangjian rice was set, while medium-quality rice was softening.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Coarse Sand and White Sugar Market Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend remained stable. The public association quoted a plate of 24 grade coarse sand white regular goods at the initial plate price of 20.4 yuan. Later, there were sporadic transactions with 0.03 yuan slightly changing. The 18 grade medium sand white was 19.53 yuan. The Dutch scarlet Mark was 16.3 yuan. The China Cotton White and Rock Candy remained unchanged. The Guohua goods were the same price. Zhenji No. 1 Cotton White was quoted at 19.7 yuan. The Chao Gang number house opened the market for 60-70 packs of Huanggang Qing at 13.8-13.75 yuan, and more than 100 packs of Longgang Qing at 11.7-11.8 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: New Silk Cocoons Continue to Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>(Pinghu Summer Dried Cocoons Shipped to Shanghai) Pinghu has had a bumper harvest of summer cocoons this year, with good quality and low cocoon prices. Most households bake the cocoons themselves. Local cocoon merchants are now collecting dried cocoons and shipping them to Shanghai for sale. Yesterday, 228 bales of summer dried cocoons were shipped to Shanghai by small steamer.</p>
<p>(Artificial Silk Imports Still Strong) Imports of European and American artificial silk were still strong last week.</p>
<p>Dutch, German, and French ships all arrived with shipments, totaling 1,584 boxes for the whole week. All of them are stored in the Customs warehouse.</p>
<h3>Tunxi Tea Market Turns Strong from Weak</h3>
<p>Due to the sale of the first batch of Zhenmei teas by Tunxi tea houses, which was sluggish and had low prices, the enthusiasm was extremely depressed. They dared not boldly search for and buy tea. Various tea merchants, seeing that the Tunxi market price was not good, all stopped their feet. In the past two weeks, the Shanghai market suddenly saw a turnaround. The high-end merchants from the source withdrew and sold at 210 yuan, the needle eyebrows opened at 80-90 yuan, and the opening prices of other teas were also still within range. The merchants who were about to close the market started searching for and buying again. In recent days, various tea merchants have transported tea to Tunxi and sold it as soon as it arrived. The market price has been raised from 40 yuan to 60 yuan. However, due to the poor tea production and weak inventory in various places this year, it is in short supply once large quantities are searched for and purchased. The market has suddenly become popular.</p>
<h3>Yixian Tea Market Also Presents Activity</h3>
<p>The Yixian tea market was unusually quiet a month ago. The mountain price gradually declined, but even if it fell to 30 yuan per stone, few people asked about it. The mountain households secretly cried out in pain, lamenting that they had goods but were worried about being poor. The number of Zhuang customers who came to purchase was also extremely small. They did not dare to take the risk of searching for and buying large quantities of Zhuang tea. In recent decades, the Shanghai sales have been smooth, and the tea market in this county has also become active with the prosperity of the Tunxi market. The mountain price has gradually increased. The source of new tea has been raised to 47 yuan per stone, and the Lvcun tea has also opened at more than 40 yuan. Zhuang customers from Tunxi have gathered and competed to buy in recent days. The attitude of the mountain households has suddenly changed to hoarding. The market still has the momentum to continue rising.</p>
<h3>Black Tea in Hubei and Hunan Gradually Sees Movement</h3>
<p>According to the Han Xun, the sales of black tea in Hubei and Hunan were sluggish in May and June, and the market price did not rise. Since the end of last month, the British and Russian firms stationed in Wuhan have gradually started buying. Anhua goods sold from 37 yuan to 80 yuan, and Changshou Street Pearls opened at 31 yuan. The market suddenly became active. In this decade, Anhua Niejiashi Changshou Street goods have been successively transported to Wuhan, and the inventory of various firms is very abundant. Recently, the Changshou Street goods have been priced by Jardine Matheson and Taiping and other foreign firms at 40 yuan, Yichang goods have been opened at 110 yuan, and Anhua goods have been opened at 90 yuan. The sales and the market have both improved compared to before. The sources from various routes have also seen a surge.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Zhejiang Tung Oil Follows the Development of the Hankou Market</h3>
<p>丨Hankou Market Raises Prices Repeatedly丨</p>
<p>Since Hankou started selling white tung oil to foreign firms at thirty-one yuan (foreign currency) per dan, and then raised the price by another eight jiao, the momentum remains strong. It wouldn't be surprising if prices increased again. Xiangyang tung oil initially opened at twenty-five yuan and three or four jiao per dan, then rose to twenty-six yuan for foreign buyers. Consequently, Hankou wholesalers were also selling at prices above twenty-six yuan. Zhejiang tung oil traditionally follows Hankou's lead closely, echoing its movements, which is expected. However, Hangzhou merchants, though not having a large stockpile, possess relatively inexpensive goods and are eager to sell while the opportunity exists. Therefore, in the past couple of days, many merchants in Shanghai sought to sell. Local firms still have ample stock, and fearing they won't be able to obtain such low prices later, they made forward contracts for thousands of loads, priced at twenty-seven yuan and four or five jiao delivered to Shanghai. Based on the current market, this is considered reasonable. It is rumored that Hangzhou merchants will have to raise prices later because the Hankou market is rising daily, making it difficult to compete. Those looking to purchase are focusing their attention on Zhejiang tung oil.</p>
<h3>Metals: Tinplate Price Drops More Than Five Yuan</h3>
<p>Thirty-five-pound tinplate experienced a sharp drop of five yuan and two jiao due to a large influx of goods. The market price is now forty-one yuan and six jiao per case. Yesterday, a copper factory purchased more than twenty cases, and a biscuit factory bought five cases. Aside from that, there were only inquiries. Overseas prices, however, have risen by two shillings, now costing sixty shillings and sixpence per case. It is said that traders found it difficult to meet market prices and did not place any orders.</p>
<h3>Tin Market: Rising Trend Slightly Checked</h3>
<p>The tin market's upward momentum has slightly subsided due to a weakening trend reported from Singapore. However, trading remains active due to brisk autumn sales of tin foil. Many transactions were reported with foreign firms.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>On Comrades in Long Gowns</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>"Comrade" affixed to a long gown—from what classic does this originate? In any case, it can certainly not be equated with "Comrade" in Sun Yat-sen suits. The rationale is clear: the Sun Yat-sen suit is generally worn by loyal comrades, whereas the long gown has no such limitations. Though those in long gowns may also be counted as comrades, they cannot all necessarily be described as loyal. Were every long gown to be both loyal and true, then</p>
<p>the world today would not be so tranquil.</p>
<p>Someone asks: "What is a comrade in a long gown?" I reply: "Comrade is the most esteemed and civilized term in the world today. And a long gown is worn by people. Therefore, in discussing these people, we speak of comrades in long gowns."</p>
<p>Comrades in long gowns wear neither a mandarin jacket nor a Sun Yat-sen suit. Though on occasion, for someone's wedding or birthday celebration, they might put on a mandarin jacket to appear cultured when bowing; and though at times they might wear a Sun Yat-sen suit to visit Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum, to give the impression of having participated in the revolution, ultimately it is merely a temporary affectation. For three hundred and sixty days of the year, they mostly wear long gowns.</p>
<p>In terms of social standing, such people are not high enough to associate with politicians and bureaucrats, yet they are more than equal to laborers whose nostrils are blackened by coal smoke. In terms of economic status, they cannot compare with the rich and capitalists, yet they are more than equal to beggars. In terms of cultural level, they are not as learned as doctors and masters, yet they are more than equal to those who read martial arts novels or look at comic books. Some have defined them as belonging to the middle class, while others call them petit bourgeois.</p>
<p>They want to eat meat, but sometimes they can only afford vegetables and tofu. They want to see plays, but they can only sit in the balcony. They must take third-class trains but refuse to ride in the trailers. They also enjoy visiting prostitutes, but they have no means to take a concubine. They want cheap rent but refuse to live in bungalows. They want to gamble, but they dare not play for big money. They hope to get rich, but they cannot afford to buy a block of the Aviation Construction Lottery tickets on their own. They want to become officials, but they lack the capital. When they are unemployed, they eat plain bread all day, but they refuse to become robbers or kidnappers. When they are jilted, they also want to vent their anger on other women, but they cannot bear the condemnation of their conscience. They speak of reason, but they cannot withstand strong emotional impulses. They are sentimental, but sometimes they also advise others to stay calm. In short, everything about them is contradictory.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when foreign invaders are battering China to pieces, they advocate for nationwide conscription to recover lost territory in the north. However, they also believe that long-term resistance or national reconstruction are ways to save the country. They advocate patriotism, but they do not support the Five-Colored Flag. They want to oppose imperialism, but they also believe in "befriending distant states while attacking those nearby." They urge others to join the volunteer army to save the country with iron and blood, but they are never willing to go to the front line themselves. They believe in saving the country by buying domestic goods, but because foreign goods are cheaper, they inevitably let money flow out of the country. Sometimes they also want to get some benefits from the Japanese, but they do not want to be denounced as traitors seeking personal gain. Sometimes they also want to support the Xuantong Emperor, but they fear being labeled as Han traitors. They are aware of their own danger and are angrily tending towards revolution, but they are afraid of their heads being hung on the city walls, dripping with fresh blood. They understand that the exploited masses are truly pitiful, but they do not agree with their thoroughgoing resistance. They are well aware of their own dead ends, but they always believe that heaven never abandons people, that there is still a glimmer of hope. They...</p>
<p>In short, these are the so-called third kind of people, the so-called comrades in long gowns. They are sorrowful, they are in pain. So, where is their way out? If you are interested, please listen to the next episode.</p>
<h3>Ramblings While Sick</h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>Because I went late the first time, I got number fifty-eight and had to wait a full two hours. So, the second time I went a little earlier. I looked at the watch on my wrist when I arrived at the hospital, and there were still twenty-five minutes before registration opened. I thought to myself that I wouldn't have to wait like yesterday, so I leisurely strolled towards the registration desk. Alas, patients were already crowding around like a beehive. Just seeing it gave me a headache. It turned out that arriving early was the same as arriving late!</p>
<p>Feeling this bitterness deeply, I happened to talk about it with Mr. C when I got home. He said that he was very familiar with Mr. S, who worked at the registration desk. So, the third time, I invited Mr. C to go with me. Sure enough, it was much more convenient. I was able to register as soon as I arrived. However, the number was already twenty-seven, so I would still have to wait a little while. Mr. S was busy, but he greeted us and invited us to sit down and rest. So many people had already registered, so we naturally could only sit and wait.</p>
<p>After about fifteen minutes, feeling mentally exhausted, I began to doze off. Mr. S saw this and quickly came over. He took the number plate from my hand and then called me upstairs. This was his kindness. Originally, there were still many numbers ahead of me, but because he had arranged things inside, I was able to jump ahead and be seen first. However, I suddenly felt uneasy. This was not because I was bothering Mr. S, but because I saw several fellow patients with earlier numbers and serious illnesses, their faces haggard, their eyes fixed on the entrance to the stairs, yet I had heartlessly jumped ahead of them, making them wait several minutes longer. Was this right? Was it wrong?</p>
<p>I thought about it again and again and realized that I really shouldn't be taking advantage of others here. At the same time, Mr. S's selling this kind of personal favor was</p>
<p>an improper act.</p>
<p>This made me think even further. I only know one person at the registration desk, so I could easily register without having to squeeze in, and I could also easily jump ahead and be seen first. If I knew the doctor there even better, I wouldn't need to register at all; I could just go straight upstairs. And that doctor would give me a careful examination, discovering that the source of my illness was not just a small pain in my neck but a kind of severe cold. If the pain in my neck was indeed a lymph node, then there would be effective remedies to treat it. The doctor would certainly not give me a dismissive look, shake his head at me, and make a hasty diagnosis after a casual examination. If I knew the person in the pharmacy even better, then when I went to get my medicine,</p>
<p>he would certainly not charge me four dimes for a small bottle of mouthwash, plus a non-negotiable three dimes for some gauze and adhesive tape.</p>
<p>In conclusion, if I knew the doctor and the pharmacist there, I think I might not have suffered through these ten days of illness or spent those ten yuan on medicine.</p>
<p>Society today is fundamentally a society of personal connections. Personal connections are all-powerful. People are accustomed to buying and selling personal favors, disregarding public affairs and morality. My experience with seeing the doctor and Mr. S's selling of personal favors is a microcosm of this phenomenon.</p>
<p>But is the selling of personal favors right? Especially in a hospital setting, how harmful is it to the public! Thinking this, and writing this, I cannot help but feel lost.</p>

<h3>Funeral Honors</h3>
<p>— Zao</p>
<p>That morning, when I went to the factory, our foreman, Master Li, came over to me and said, "Our factory's Chief Wang passed away last night. Engineer Shi has notified us that the factory will be closed for three days starting today in mourning." Work had already been reduced by two days a week this month, and now there will be three more days of closure. These are truly difficult times.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago, it was said that Chief Wang was originally a staff member in our factory. Because he handled affairs well, he gained the trust of the foreign manager, who entrusted all matters to him. Since then, he has become quite wealthy. Besides being the chief in our factory, he has shares in several large stores and is also the honorary captain of the security corps and the chairman of the orphanage, and so on.</p>
<p>Since the master of Wang's mansion passed away, the people there have been busy day and night taking care of the funeral arrangements, setting up the mourning hall, and preparing the funeral objects. It is said that an embroidered shroud and a coffin made of precious wood cost four thousand silver dollars.</p>
<p>During the encoffining, outside the mourning curtain stood four burly armed policemen. Except for relatives, no one else was allowed to get close to see. It is said that because Chief Wang was lying in the coffin with gold ingots placed in his hands and feet, the security was so tight.</p>
<p>After Chief Wang was encoffined, the sacrificial offerings sent from various places were truly numerous. There were hundreds of flower wreaths and elegiac couplets alone. Our factory, initiated by Engineer Shi, deducted two silver dollars from each worker's salary this month to respectfully present five satin and Xiang embroidery "Ten Thousand People" umbrellas.</p>
<p>The day of the funeral was truly lively. Wooden effigies of gods led the way, followed by flags, gongs, and drums. There were signs announcing silence and avoidance, monks and Taoist priests, policemen, and security corps,</p>
<p>military band, flower wreaths, and a tall memorial banner proclaiming "Honored by the Qing Dynasty XX Republic of China XX Rank XX Medal." When the coffin passed in front of several large stores, the stores set up sacrificial offerings to pay their respects.</p>
<p>On the morning of the second day after Chief Wang's funeral, the opening article on the local news page of various newspapers had a large headline: "Funeral Honors of Wang XX."</p>

<p>Radio stations are truly amazing. One room of sound is known in all directions. In the Jiangnan region, there are thousands upon thousands. It counts that every household has a radio. Advertisements can be broadcast at any time, surpassing newspapers in delivering them door to door. Therefore, it is a way for companies and businesses to boast.

<h3>Modern Celebrity Painting and Calligraphy, No. 19</h3>
<h3>Mr. Chen Wu-jiu's Calligraphy (Brief Biography)</h3>
<p>Chen Wu-jiu, former Anfu Envoy of Zhejiang, Counselor of the National Government, deeply versed in the study of law and medicine, has written extensively, devoted to the revolution for thirty years, and has repeatedly made meritorious contributions, but his nature is sweet and self-effacing. Party and national leaders regard him as the contemporary Fu Qingzhu. He was originally proficient in the eight methods of calligraphy, closely resembling Huang Tingjian, but later his style changed, entering Liu Gongquan from Yang Shaoji. In recent years, he has immersed himself in the study of chapter writing, decomposition, seal script, and official script, tracing the sacred cursive script and broadly examining the natural style of the Righteous Sacrifice. Coupled with his skill, even a wave or a stroke has its own style, which is no longer comparable to the former intermittent moments of refinement and sloppiness.</p>

<h3>Under the Traffic Lights (34)</h3>
<p>— Xilin</p>
<p>In reality, in our China, any movement exists only in newspapers. Now let us look at the antics of these patriotic activists:</p>
<p>Wang Hua has been particularly radiant these days. Ever since he rented a chartered car the day before yesterday and took a ride around the streets, people who meet him on the road are willing to greet him and chat. Sitting in the car, he looks proudly at the pedestrians on the street and then at the shining wire wheels under his car. That kind of petty self-satisfaction is simply laughable. But the so-called Shanghai celebrities and dignitaries are often created by this kind of petty person. Wang Hua will certainly advance on this road, and this route is expanding: he is thinking about how the XXXX Group Federation can also raise funds for anti-Japanese donations. By raising funds for anti-Japanese donations, he can get to know several anti-Japanese military leaders, so that he can see the benefits in the future, and he can also skim off some oil 丨丨at least he can skim off a little oil. He does not believe that so many donations from various associations can reach the hands of the troops in full. Thinking this, he immediately shouted to the chauffeur in the car:</p>
<p>"Hurry up, go west, go west!"</p>
<p>The chauffeur walked quickly for a short distance and had already reached his destination. According to the rules, he first handed in his business card and was then invited in. The living room was full of five or six people in long gowns and gowns. One of them, particularly short, like a grasshopper, jumped up and stood up:</p>
<p>"Ah, I haven't seen you for a long time, Mr. Wang! Please come in and sit down!"</p>
<p>We have seen this short host before. He is Ningbo's Doctor of Economics, whom Li Shiqiao casually saw when he accompanied the third concubine to the tea dance party at Wu Ziqing's mansion. He is a famous university professor. Wang Hua and Li Shiqiao were both his students. The long-gowned guests sitting in the living room are all financial giants in Shanghai. Looking at the situation, they are obviously discussing a confidential matter. Wang Hua was invited into a living room inside. The short professor politely invited him to sit down. He wiped his palms and waited for Wang Hua to explain his intention.</p>
<p>"I have always wanted to visit Mr. Li!" Wang Hua refused to skip the pleasantries, and only after a while did he say: "Today I am here on behalf of the XXXX Group Federation to ask Mr. Li for something. Since we contacted these hundred or so groups to form the federation, we have felt that our strength is ultimately weak and we are very ashamed. Now there is no actual work performance············" He stopped again. He knew that it was not appropriate to say such grandiose words, especially since he was very clear about the character of this Doctor of Economics. So he changed to a very kind expression, moved his seat closer, and lowered his voice:</p>
<p>"Mr. Li, of course you can appreciate my meaning, and you will always be willing to support your students. Now this group is all managed by our classmates such as Li Shiqiao and Hu Yuanliang. We should take this opportunity to build a foundation. To organize a group, we must show results to others. But we are all humble and our words have no power. We must ask you to help us. Now we are preparing to publicly raise anti-Japanese donations in the name of the group. We are not important enough to make people believe in generously donating, so we have come to ask Mr. Li to several in the future, Mr. Li will</p>

<p>Film Special</p>
<h3>The German Film Industry Under Hitler (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Huang Junru</p>
<p>Recently, the German film industry has been almost completely Fascistized. How could the National Socialist Party have completely Fascistized the German film industry in such a short period of time? Needless to say, on the one hand, it was due to the high-pressure policies adopted by Hitler after he came to power (strict censorship); but on the other hand, it was also due to the fact that Hugenberg, the manager of UFA, joined the cabinet as Minister of Economy, and Hitler himself was concerned about the propaganda power of films. Before Hitler came to power, he had already produced several films promoting the party's teachings. After gaining power, he immediately established a "Propaganda Department" in the cabinet. In addition to the news, drama, radio, and national education bureaus, he also added a film bureau. The first propaganda minister was Dr. Goebbels, the propaganda minister of the National Socialist Party. Goebbels carried out Hitler's film policy step by step, revealing the fate of state-run films and actively intervening in the federal film industry, causing film practitioners to feel extremely uneasy.</p>
<p>However, the government could not completely ignore the film industry's unease, so Goebbels recently published a long article in his own name, saying that lately there have been various speculations about the future of the German film industry, causing unease and weakening the desire to invest; but this worry is completely unfounded. The government is currently working hard to draft film regulations, which will not only ensure the independence of the German film economy but also respect the creative rights of the people and never restrict the freedom of film practitioners. As for saying that the Propaganda Department will force film practitioners to produce certain propaganda films, it is even more absurd.</p>
<p>Even so, this is just the government's dignified explanation, and it still adopts a narrow partisan attitude towards the production and screening of Fascist films and the strict censorship of other films. For example, when Fascist films such as "Morning" and "The Chorus of Roden" were screened for the last time, Prime Minister Hitler, Deputy Prime Minister Papen, and Minister of Economy Hugenberg and other cabinet ministers visited the scene to boost morale. "Morning" is a sea battle film based on the activities of the German U-Boat large submarine in the European War. It is not only UFA's largest work in recent years but also the most successful Fascistization film. "The Roden Chorus" is a historical drama based on the story of King Frederick the Great's illustrious military exploits in destroying the Austrian army in Roden, Sicily in 1757, and it was also produced by UFA. This is obviously a patriotic film praising King Frederick and promoting the Prussian spirit.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the National Socialist Party has films produced by the party. "Bleeding Germany," which was recently released in Berlin, is one of them. This film was originally produced by the National Socialist Party before it came to power. At that time, it was banned from screening by the Social Democratic Party government, so it was not released until now. This film is a historical film based on the history of Germany from 1870 to the beginning of 1933, that is, from the Battle of Sedan and the coronation of the Kaiser to the rise of the National Socialist Party.

<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3>Review of "No Other Woman"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Produced by Leidienhua, screened in Nanjing. First of all, I feel it is necessary to introduce the story. A steel mill worker named Jim loves and marries a village girl, Anna. Among their companions, a young man is dedicated to dye production and is valued by Anna. Soon, the young man achieves excellent results in dye making. Jim, persuaded by his wife, invests in dye production, becoming wealthy overnight and having a son. Later, Jim encounters a licentious harlot, leading the poor couple to end up in court. Jim falsely accuses his wife of having an affair and uses this as grounds for divorce. Heartbroken, the wife agrees to the divorce, but asks that her son not be taken away by Jim, as she claims to have had an affair and the child is not Jim's. At this point, Jim is filled with remorse and, deeply loving his son, resolutely retracts his confession, citing evidence that the child is indeed his and declaring that the witnesses were bribed to slander her. He wishes to withdraw the divorce case, but the court imprisons him for false accusation. After serving his sentence, Jim returns to being a steel mill worker, but soon, Anna reconciles with him.</p>
<p>In this story, we can see that the author's main theme is nothing more than teaching people to strive for progress, that even a worker can become a rich man. At the same time, it is imperative not to be infatuated with women and abandon one's faithful wife. The so-called virtuous wife and good mother serve as a female model. However, this kind of preaching is very weak, especially considering that a worker's meager wages in daily life can only afford potatoes and cornmeal, yet he can become a rich man, which is truly unimaginable. Yet this is "two seconds" of "killing medicine," teaching them to buy lottery tickets to get rich, which is the same propaganda method as this film. As for the current economic crisis intensifying, the author of this film is still indulging in sweet fantasies, which is even more laughable. Secondly, while we cannot deny that being infatuated with women after becoming wealthy is a common phenomenon in today's society, merely using this to highlight the virtue of a virtuous wife and good mother is not particularly clever. Moreover, can a good wife who remains with her husband until death continue to exist under the current economic system? And can this alone save the declining moral values? Even taking a step back, it's just an ordinary story.</p>
<p>Formally speaking, this is a tragedy. But the entire performance fails to evoke emotions. Although Anna's life is worthy of sympathy for those who are sentimental, as she watches her husband flirt with another woman and be abandoned. But the director fails to emphasize the emotions, so Anna's suffering ultimately fails to move people to sadness. It is clear that this is due to the lack of depiction of her. However, on the other hand, the director's depiction of Jim is very detailed and consistent. The harlot is also well-portrayed. As for his use of high-speed techniques to handle unnecessary processes, while economical, the process of the harlot colluding with the lawyer to bribe witnesses is too brief, making the court scene seem sudden. At the same time, the court is a climax, but the complicated dialogues are tiresome. Irene Dunne's performance is much worse than in "Show Boat." Charles Bickford is very good. Overall, this is a vulgar work.</p>
<h3>Cheng Bugao's Summer Retreat, Heaven Knows</h3>
<p>These days, director Cheng Bugao's "Spring Silkworms" is filming a large scene in Bai's outdoor studio, where the set department has built an artificial village, with thatched cottages and bamboo fences, small bridges and flowing water, and several white geese swimming and calling in the stream. The scenery is beautiful and very moving. The staff in the directing department often look at the fake village and say, "It would be nice to go to the countryside to escape the heat on such a hot day!" Once, Cheng Bugao finished filming a scene and came in to rest, covered in sweat. Everyone joked with him, "Bugao, you're really living the life, going to the countryside to escape the heat every day." But Cheng Bugao smiled and said, "This kind of summer retreat, heaven knows, I really can't stand it!"</p>
<h3>On "Educational Films"</h3>
<p>— Zhong</p>
<p>In the past, everyone only knew that movies were for entertainment; now, some people realize that their use is very broad. Thus, political parties use them as tools to promote policies and political views, businessmen use them as weapons to expand their businesses, and the progress of other undertakings is making use of them. Now, there is the initiation of "educational films" and the establishment of an "Educational Film Association." "Educational films," as the name suggests, are naturally for promoting educational films, which is to use the power of film to advance education.</p>
<p>Indeed, education can be divided into two aspects: ordinary education and social education. Ordinary education is school education. The current school education methods are too rigid. Most children and young people in school do not like that kind of rigid classroom life. Educational films use their natural love of movies to instill them with fresh knowledge from the movies, to supplement the shortcomings of current education methods. Social education, on the other hand, refers to the education of the general public in society. The majority of the people are ignorant and unaware. If we want to save the country from ruin, we must enable them to acquire knowledge; and to enable them to acquire knowledge, nothing is better than using the power of film as a tool to educate them.</p>
<p>Now, in order to uphold educational films, I respectfully offer my humble opinion as follows:</p>
<p>㈠ The scripts for educational films should be edited by domestic education experts and assisted by filmmakers. ㈡ Existing movie actors may not all be able to perform in educational films. The association should establish an "Educational Film Actor Training School," hiring filmmakers and educators to serve as professors, and recruit a group of young people with aspirations in film to provide them with practical training. ㈢ Rent foreign educational films and screen them in cinemas everywhere at low prices. ㈣ In the future, it is hoped that there will be a large, non-commercial screening venue dedicated to screening such films.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor: I have read the article "Star News" by Mr. Zhou Jingzhi, published in your esteemed publication on the 16th, and much of its content does not conform to the facts, such as: ㈠ "Spring Silkworms" is directed by Cheng Bugao, but this article claims that it has been changed to be directed by Zhang Shichuan; ㈡ "Sister's Tragedy," in which Hu Ping starred, has now been renamed "Sister's Tragedy," but the article claims it has been renamed "Love-Hate Symphony"; ㈢ The so-called actively preparing for a second factory, with Zhou Jianyun in charge, is even more unfounded. Accordingly, we request that you make corrections to show the truth.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Star Film Company</p>
<h3>On Behalf of a Letter</h3>
<p>To Mr. Gu Ruimin: Your manuscript "Screen Instead of Textbook" will be disclosed in the coming days, but who exactly is the "Mr. Houchang" mentioned in your letter? Please let us know.</p>
<p>To Mr. Yingxian: Your manuscript was accompanied by postage stamps but did not include an address, so your manuscript cannot be returned. Please indicate your honorable address. The Editor</p>

<h3>Tour of European and American Studios (4)</h3>
<p>— Yunyan</p>
<p>㈥ United Artists Studio</p>
<p>｜United Artists Film Company Studio on Formosa Road, Hollywood｜</p>
<p>United Artists in Hollywood can be said to be the most unique of all the studios. Its origin should be attributed to Schulberg, who was once a literary critic before joining Lasky Film Company and collaborating with Adolph Zukor. Because of Mann Bickford and Fan Pengke's films, which he distributed, his fame was also very great. In addition, Chaplin and the famous director Griffith both collaborated with him, so his power became even stronger. Later, he also invited these four famous figures and other production companies to form this new company, United Artists.</p>
<p>Only in United Artists are the stars shareholders. The first production was "Robin Hood," which was filmed in 1920 at the Santa Delilah studio. This film cost £140,000, but ultimately made £600,000. At the same time, Chaplin was filming "The Gold Rush" at United Artists' Sipoliwa studio. In addition, he also wrote the script and directed the film "A Woman of Paris." This is all the past history of United Artists. But now, United Artists' studio policy is still the same as before. All shares and rights are still held by several stars. It is indeed a strange studio, and the most interesting thing is the private residences in the corners, but the gates are opened separately. Goldwyn lives inside, and the Fairbanks couple often stay in their own prepared house when they are busy.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, United Artists Film Company occupies a very important page in film history. As for all the equipment inside the studio, it is also very perfect and luxurious, so many people admire it. Like Rick's films, although distributed by Paramount, they are also filmed at the United Artists studio.</p>
<p>㈦ Universal City</p>
<p>｜Universal Film Company Studio in Universal City, California｜</p>
<p>Universal Film Company is also one of the most powerful film organizations in Hollywood. Its studio can be considered one of the largest in the world. The location is the place where the Spanish and Mexican wars were fought most fiercely, covering an area of 230 acres. It was completed in 1915. In 1919, nearly 42 film companies were filming here.
