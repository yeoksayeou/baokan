<h3 id="c20">日人之恫嚇手段晦 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>日軍假借僞國之名侵擾熱河。實行開戰而猶戴和平面具。我國以守將付託非人。致長敵方氣燄。頃者敵騎且迫長城。駸駸乎有進窺華北之勢。而日本軍部乃又發表其非正式之聲明。其要點。</p>
<p>「第一、中國須中止排日。在適當時期。開始直接交涉」。</p>
<p>「第二、停止一切抗日工作。否則日本將採取自衛行動」。</p>
<p>「第三、劃長城以内地區爲中立區域。日軍將止於長城以北」。</p>
<p>此種論調。在瀋陽事變之後。錦州失陷以前。吾人固已習聞之。其侮辱我已達極點。同時更借口特殊利益旣得權利種種帝國主義所習用之口調。以麻醉彼國内人民。以玩弄世界各國。對我國領土主權。則加以鐵騎蹂躪而無所顧忌。</p>
<p>東三省旣淪爲左袵。熱河復陷敵手。我雖有心和平。而敵則猛進不已。今彼又效去年錦州故技。强割我土地。魚肉我人民。所謂「和」「戰」問題。乃由東北一角而延長至於河北。强求中立區域。竟展至長城以南。而於實際上。則正續發援兵。擬奪我沿邊要隘。自古北口以至於山海關。皆將重加威脅。其用心又可知。</p>
<p>夫今日之世界。國界雖嚴。而國與國間。距離乃因交通便利而縮短。日本肆力侵略我國。於國際關係。自國聯决議接受十九委員會報告書後。其對各國關係。乃愈趨硬化。公理正義。雖歸於我。而暴力掠奪。且愈加甚。故日本帝國主義。以恐嚇手段脅制國聯不遂。近復欲實行退出國聯。匪特置國聯盟約於不顧。且將伸其鐵手逞其馬蹄而粉碎一切。假令北美合衆國而不發生空前金融恐慌。歐洲各國。不竭全力於自國之警戒者。我國或可偸安苟活於列國新均勢之下。今則列國在東亞均衡之形勢旣破。我國雖欲勉强偸安而不可得矣。日本見其冒險政策有利。於是益大放厥詞。肆行無忌。前此猶懸掛和平招牌。假作縮小軍備之主張。今乃露骨侵略。由充實軍備而擴張軍備矣。其本年軍費八億二千萬日金。已屬戰時預算。熱河戰争陡起。恐將增至十億有奇。且其初年（未經完成訓練）之兵卒。在第六、第八、兩師團與騎兵第四旅團歩兵第十四旅團各部隊中。竟占三分之一以上。是則日本軍備擴張。固不待軍縮會議之完全失敗也。故其對世界之恐嚇。對我國之侵略行動。已足充分證明而有餘。</p>
<p>然則彼日本者。何以又貌爲和平。聲言不侵入華北。更當保持長江。復言中日友好耶。蓋日本號爲軍國。十年一戰。爲其國策。而其於戰争所必需之原料。鐵鑛來源。百分之九十皆仰給於海外。其基礎不固。事甚明顯。彼旣欲吸收我國鐡鑛及其他原料。而長江流域之巨大市場。尤爲日本消售貨品之絶好區域。故日人希望在我國沿長江及近海各地。維持舊有商務關係。且力圖發展。使其國内經濟恐慌。借此减少。同時更可由此而調劑其侵略東北與熱河之軍費。爲計之工。孰逾於此。</p>
<p>是以熱河旣得手。即假詞劃設中立區域。用以緩和我國之「民氣」。藉以穩定其侵略之根基。若干時日之後。恐敵騎又將出現於中立區域。而進窺平津擾亂河北矣。我國人其速認清敵人之企圖。萬勿輕信其甘言。亦勿顧懼其恐嚇。</p>

<p>倫敦今晚日本代表松岡洋右、及中國駐英公使郭泰祺、皆用無綫電廣播二人對於中日衝突之見解、播音地點不同、故二人並未晤面、松岡行抵播音臺時、有共産黨人一羣、對渠採取敵對態度、但警察不令行近、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦今日凡裝無綫電者均聆得日内瓦日本總代表松岡及駐倫敦中國公使郭祺泰之播音演説、郭泰祺在其播音演詞中力闢日本爲阻遏共産主義之屏障一説、謂日本政策在征服亞洲大陸、中國實屬無辜、李頓報告書與國聯大會皆已有此聲明、郭使臚舉一九二六年以還之中國進歩、謂中國不獨不排外、且準備與歐美國際合作、至於日本則爲搗亂之國、仇外情感瀰漫全國、尤以最近兩年爲甚、爲英國及歐洲利益計、日本侵略須加制止、如國聯會員而擁護國聯盟約、則即可制止侵略、而侵略亦將自止矣、中國人民希望英國爲世界表率、首先對於日本軍閥拒絶其作戰所需之物品、英國祇須作道德上之主張、對於侵略國拒絶外交上財政上商業上之輔助、即可消滅今日遠東之戰争、且或可掃除將來各種戰争也云云、松岡謂滿洲爲遠東問題礎石、故日本不能容許仇視日本之人民管理之、此不獨爲日本生死問題、且爲避免避免遠東分裂紊亂之問題日本之不能在國聯提出满洲問題、亦猶一九二七年英國之不能提出滬案耳、满洲之發逹、由於日本之發動及其事業、國聯並未嚴重反對日兵襄助满洲國肅清南北满之非法分子、故渠不解何以國聯反對日本在熱河履行同樣工作、因熱河满洲之一部也、事實現漸證明日本在满行動之稳健、满洲國現已在逹其願望之途中、日本之唯一目的、在恢復東亞之和平、而維持之云、（十二日路透電）</p>
<p>東京齋藤首相内田外昨午後四時入宫覲見日皇、關於退出國聯手續、奏請諮詢樞府、因此諮詢案日内即交樞府、樞密院即由二上書記官之手、開始初步審查、十三日邀請法制局長官有田外務次官到樞府事務所、關於法案及　　　、　聽樞府之説明、初步審查三四日可畢、其間即任命精查委員長及八名委員、於初步審查後、開精查委員會、大約二週可完、豫定可上呈樞府本會議得其承認通過、故退出正式通告、約在月末、（電通電）</p>
<p>倫敦國聯會满洲調查團主席李頓勳爵、今日爲英政府禁止軍火運往中日兩國之决定作辯護、略謂兩國之中、有一國已被認爲違反國聯盟約、故英國政府不能准許軍火運往該國、至對其他一國、則當由國際方面、成立妥協、予以特殊待遇之後、始能允許軍火運往該國、此項妥協若無從實現、則禁止軍火出口之令、對於各該國、即應同時取銷云云、（哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦自由黨領袖勞合喬治、對於現政府外交政策、加以激烈攻撃、謂英政府對於軍縮問題、採取片面政策、而阻止德國之實行軍備平等權利、結果乃使德國不得不挺而走險、此咄咄逼人之德國軍事獨裁制度之所以能成立也、至於遠東方面、中日兩國之間、英國所採政策、猶預不决、使日本得以蔑視國聯會、國聯威信所受打擊、當以此最爲嚴重云云、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦松岡今晚抵倫敦、語路透訪員稱、渠除向日皇及日政府報告外、完畢其外交使命、渠赴歐洲各京城游歷、毫無外交作用、渠此次赴荷蘭、純係私人游歷、因渠欲知荷蘭油業、調查從煤取油一事之結果也云、聞有人向松岡建議、日本油業宜與荷蘭油業互换消息、以期繼續研究、松岡對路透訪員又謂在遠東有關係之列强應謀取方法、以塡補因英日契約終止而起之罅隙、遠東現有之困難、其大部分即由此而作、渠以私人地位發言、甚歎息美國集其艦隊於太平洋之决議、因此舉足增日本對美之憤懣也、但渠以爲雖在世界目前惶擾狀態中、美日邦交儘可置於穏固基礎之上云、松岡定三月十七日啓程赴紐約、（十二日路透電）</p>

<p>（國民十一日柏林電）　警務當局、聞久居俄國之匈牙利共黨領袖、與德國領袖各一人、已秘密抵此、希圖煽亂、今日已將二人肖像傳播四處</p>
<h3 id="c53">蘇聯最近對外政策(莫洛道夫原著) <a href="#c53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>再説别一方面、一九三零年蘇英所訂商約之廢止、亦可説一説、此約之廢止、係出於英政府、此舉眞正的目的、吾人尙不得而知、不過猜測言之、若以斷絶商約來恐嚇蘇聯、那是輕舉妄動、蘇聯並不害怕的、又假若想以此給蘇聯以某種損失、那更是失計、凡英國需要蘇聯訂貨者、都明白這點、我人深知、凡是對蘇聯有經常外交和貿易關係之國家、比之别國、得益不淺、尤其蘇聯、與有些資本主義國家不同、總是按期完全履行自已義務、從不違約賴債、</p>
<p>説到這裏、不能不提及蘇聯對外政策之基本任務、貫澈和平政策、不論與保證一般和平有關之問題、或與第二次大戰有關之問題、蘇聯均予以深切注意、去年二月間、蘇聯對軍縮間題提出一般眞正裁軍案、亦無非是表現此意、</p>
<p>蘇聯政府向好多國家提議訂立互不侵犯條約、亦係爲他所抱之和平政策而鬥争之表現、單在去年、蘇聯在訂立互不侵犯公約問題上得到巨大進展、波蘭·芬蘭·愛沙尼亞·立陶宛·等國政府方面之簽字、並批准互不侵犯條約、更是蘇聯外交之巨大勝利、這些互不侵犯條約、對鞏固和平事業、圴有莫大意義、蘇聯與法國亦簽訂了互不侵犯條約、不過此事尙功虧一簣、因法國尙末批准此約、（譯者按、蘇法條約業已批准）、</p>
<p>惟蘇聯對羅馬尼亞關係略異、羅國曾拒絕與蘇聯簽訂互不侵犯條約、所以在西方拒絕簽訂互不侵犯公約的、只留下與蘇聯爲鄰的一國、用不着詳細去考察這問題、只須指出就是羅國之拒絶與蘇聯訂立互不侵犯條約、其原因並非在於羅國政府本身對此問題有何意見、而是有外部的原因在、政治大辭典中、往往把事實上無獨立外政策而係隸屬於别一强國對外政策之這種國家、算在所謂「獨立」國家之内、是極其錯誤的、不論如何、對此受害者、只是羅馬尼亞及其政府、現在進而論遠東問題、</p>
<p>國聯關於遠東問題、舉世共知、是在怎樣喧閙、自從國聯受理满洲事件以來、一年多了、關於此問題之决議、也不知有好幾次了、國聯討論中國和满洲局勢、亦已多次、並派遣專門調查委員會赴當地去調查、該委員會報告、亦已公佈好久、並且返歐復命了、國聯對此間題、成立一個委員之外會、又是一個委員會、其决議亦無以復加了、然未有尺寸進步、只有一事進展頗速、這就是國聯在全世界眼中之威信、日益掃地罷了、</p>
<p>蘇聯從未將自已希望和國聯及其所設委員會聯繋起來、但遠東國際關係問題、對蘇聯極爲切身、因此、他不得不採取好多方法、</p>
<p>蘇聯政府考慮到遠東複雜化的環境、在一年前就向日本提議訂立互不侵犯條約、在現國際環境下、此舉的政治意義、至爲顯然、毋須多説、然而日政府不久曾通知蘇聯政府、謂訂立此約、尙非其時云云、日政府拒絶蘇聯政府訂立互不侵犯公約提議之理由、用不着去詳爲分析、我們知道、此拒絶固是臨時的、然也不能不顧慮到事實、</p>
<p>蘇聯政府在遠東是嚴守中立政策、即現在仍確守此立塲不變、將來也是貫澈此政策到底、然日本少數政界人物對蘇聯態度、近來令人不能不注意、如日軍部關於蘇聯政府和蘇聯將來駐華大使、所傳播挑戰的消息、姑不論蘇聯政府曾對此種反蘇聯謡言堅予否認、而日外相内田於一月二十一日對日議會演説中、又重演故技、</p>
<p>這種反蘇聯之謡言、不撃自破、用不着去駁斥、至於中蘇外交關係之恢復、蘇聯政府解决此種問題、是不管此舉對誰有益和對誰無益、他自知以一般和平利益、自已和平政策爲出發點的、</p>
<p>内田氏在日國會上宣稱、自满洲事件發生之日起、蘇日關係上並末發生不快之事、因蘇聯政府保持「愼重立塲」云云、這個應該特加指出的、就是問題並非在蘇聯政策是愼重的、這一個政策、不惟愼重、且係深思熟慮的、蘇聯政府對此出發點、是根據於一般和平利益和鞏固對外和平利益、這一個和平政策、不問各國評價如何、蘇聯政府將在自已對外關係上堅决貫澈到底、</p>
<p>國際環境、又提醒蘇聯要深加警戒、尤其特别注意遠東形勢之必要、這個須在一切工作和全部的建設事業上反映出來、一九三三年在社會主義之建設上、須有更大的進步、因爲蘇聯内外形勢之鞏固、全依其經濟工作之勝利而定的、（未完）</p>

<p>丨南京王慕冲君來函</p>
<p>我有一個問題請教你們！希祈指示，事實是這樣的：説到我的生命完全　在封建勢力的社會裏生長出來的，所以我的婚姻也是完全不自主而由　父母之命，媒妁之言而成立的，記得在八歲時，我的父母就替我與那同里的李氏之女訂了婚，那時我年紀還小，當然談不到什麽自主和自由，反抗和抵抗，只知道讀三字經：一爲人子，孝父母，並不曉得其他，在中　讀書的時候嗎？木來幾提出表示不和那不識字的人訂婚，然而因人經濟不能獨立，不能脱離家庭關係，如果要和家庭吵！只有馬上辍輟學，因事情又不能如願以償，在十七歳時，（民十九年）我已在貴州省立某中學畢業，這時我的父母和親戚族老等輩，看見我在省城（貴陽）讀書回來，不勝歡喜極了，於是都來勸我的父母定期替我完婚，這時我已預備出外來書讀書，再三表示拒絶，然而「昔日之我」，力量不足，不能突破那個環境，就此而暫時屈服，至於那李氏女，是個富人之女，未讀書，不識字，原來我家不十分好，而她家有錢，不知怎的她父母一定要將她配給我，我的父母的腦筋和她的父母一樣！封建！頑固！　我是極端不願意！第一就是她不識字，然而自强迫和她結婚以後，我還是照常讀書，立志不揿移，彼此的感情，平平常常，不厚不薄，後來最使我想不到的是；她原來是個一識字的鄉下姑娘，然而她性情很温和對我很謙恭，遜讓，不驕傲，凡事都依從我解决，對於我的父母又特别尊敬，無如我還是依舊是平平常常的對她，因爲她不識字。不明人情事故，不知世界大勢，對於男女的結合夫妻的眞義，更不知其所以然，像這樣的人，和木偶又何異，而且原來又不是自願結合，據我看來··她的長處，不能補她的短處，如此怎能長處下去呢，和她住了兩個半月，雖没有絶對破裂，但也無深情，從此我就到南京來了，不覺已是兩年，我完全也不提她了，現在我正在徘徊！猶豫假如要和她脱離罷！不惟我家庭不答應我，就是她亦不肯離脱我！在我們那地方，像這樣的女人，前途更是危險了，如果不和她離脱罷！只有終身和那木偶樣的人做夫婦，不惟説幸福談不到，而且自已太覺没有勇氣！教她讀書罷！她年紀又大，要長我四歲，我又在外面六七千里，究竟要怎麽辦呢，</p>
<p>答：來信讀悉，答復如下：你的夫人不是自由結婚的，自然是不如意：兼之「不識字，不明人情世故，不知世界大勢，對於男女的結合，夫妻的眞義，更不知其所以然」，這更使你失望。不過，我説一句話，你莫怪。内地女子不識字，是一般的現象，外邊的學校的女子當然没有這一種缺憾，然而「不明人情世故」那就很難説了。以我們的經騐，都市的時髦女子眞正懂得人情世故的也不可多得，眞是很少很少！至於「不知世界大勢，對於男女的結合，夫婦的眞義，更不知其所以然」，這種缺點絶不是尊夫有一個人所獨有，而是一般的女子，甚至一般所謂大學畢業，外國畢業的女學士，女博士，恐怕能以明瞭世界大勢，深識男女的結合與夫妻的眞義的，也是難乎其難。我且反問足下一句，足下試一反躬自問··我果對於世界大勢瞭如指掌麽？我果對於男女結合與夫婦眞義，洞悉無餘麽？恐怕足下不敢一點不猶疑地給一個肯定的答復。那未，自已做不到的事情，反去責備人，責備一個無知無識的女子，這實在太不恕道。我們不贊成你這種不近情理的責備。依我們的意見是這樣··（一）你的夫人既然對你很謙和，很恭順，對你父母又孝順，這在舊式女子是已經難得。若果因爲她不識字，那就勸她出來讀書，好在她的父母有錢，一定樂於栽培她的；人情世故只要出來多經歴些便會曉得的，這一層不成問題。（二）我們看問題還是在她的年紀，她比你大幾歲。這照普通生理上説，是不大合適的；然而最好也是你先要求她出來讀書，俟她到了通都大邑，多見些世界，知識跟世界便會漸漸不同，人生觀也會漸漸改變，那時你所不滿意於她的或須漸漸都没有了，至少也可大大地减少，或則你會重新愛她的。萬一兩情終於不能投契，大家當面説明；她固然也不會再像從前那樣封建頭腦，以離婚爲女子的奇恥大辱，自已可以另外找到她的相當的愛人；你從此脱離羈絆，「天家任鳥飛」，再找你的理想的女子！但是我還要奉勸你一句：眼界不要太高；要找又通人情世故，又明世界大勢，又深知夫妻眞義的女子是没有的，假使有這種女子的話，你是滿足了，但又恐怕足下不見得就是她的意中人！</p>

<p>— 百合</p>
<p>－黎明尙有待－</p>
<p>從前歐洲有一個「黑暗時期」，還有一個「文藝復興時期」，都是在歷史上很重要的。可是到這年頭兒，這個不知伊於何底的世界，又踏進了一個有一百二十分嚴重性的「無辦法時期」。大家儘搔頭摸耳，終於挖空心思，没有辦法。</p>
<p>一副紳士眉眼的國聯老先生，儘着説，日本應把東北吐出來，把軍隊退入鐵路區域内。日本不從命令，請問有何辦法。甲國怕乙國有了强大的軍備，將被威脅，於是很聰明的發起軍縮。但是人家可不是呆子，你説軍縮，我説軍備平等。以子之矛，攻子之盾，請問有何辦法？因失業問題的日趨嚴重，不免招致經濟革命的危險。經濟革命是誰都覺得可怖的，不過失業問題，終究無法解决，請問有何辦法。世界大戰是誰都不願引起的，因爲大家已嘗到歐戰的滋味，覺得流血那回事，究竟是痛苦的。但是你想奪我的權利，我想拉斷你的生命線，紅眉毛對着綠眼睛，而偏要不走世界大戰那條路，請問有何辦法？殺人償命，欠債還錢，這是天經地義，無可逃避的。但是債户一把眼淚，一把鼻涕的儘着拖延，存心抵頼，請問有何辦法？在帝國主義壓迫之下殖民地，逐漸地看破了帝國主義的紙老虎，抵當了重大的犠牲，奮起反抗，請問帝國主義者的毒瓦斯砲無法壓制革命情緖時，帝國主義者，有何辦法？</p>
<p>現代的一切不景氣，籠罩了整個的世界，我們中國果然無辦法，世界各國，也都嚷着無辦法。「長夜正漫漫，黎明尙有待」。這「無辦法時期」，恐怕正不易度過哪。</p>
<h3 id="c200">「娛樂」與「救國」 <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— 柯定盦</p>
<p>我們中國，每在經過一次國難之後</p>
<p>，好似打了一次針一樣，暫時的興奮，終歸於沈寂，自從最近的九一八以後，那一針的功效，比較的長些，可是一般酣醉在聲色狗馬之中的公子哥兒，依然如此，却也學着熱心的人們，這樣説道：</p>
<p>「娛樂救國」！</p>
<p>娛樂眞個能夠救國，那麽「吃飯」「睡覺」，都可以救國了，這是多麽怪誕的説話啊！</p>
<p>根據了娛樂救國的宗旨，所以那××將軍，在他的故土砲火彌天的時候，他還要在故城陶情於歌聲琴韻之中，這纔是實行着「娛樂救國」呢！</p>
<p>「娛樂眞的不能救國嗎？」有人這樣問我，我説：</p>
<p>「娛樂也能救國，不過要把方式改變一下子，那纔能適合娛樂救國的原意。假如你有朋友來時，你要請他看戲，照最普通的化費，兩個人也得要化上三元，你就把這三元去捐助。同時你可和你的朋友説明，今天我本來要請你看戲的，因爲給愛國心所衝動，所以情願將請你看戲的三元，拏來捐助東北，想你和我，一樣地愛國，當然也贊同的。」</p>
<p>我想「愛國之心，人所同具」！你這樣地和你的朋友説，你的朋友不必説，他是一定答應的，而且還非常敬佩你呢！</p>
<p>上海的娛樂塲所，如京戲館，影劇院，遊藝塲，按摩院，球塲，書場以及其他説不出，呌不來的秘密地方，眞是不知有多少。假使我們中國人都能照我這個方法，「用熱血和熱力」的幹。（註）他的結果，實在不是一兩句話可以形容。這個方法能夠實行的時候，也就是中華民國翻身的日子。</p>
<p>現在不是「航空救國」的時候嗎。在上海的中國人，能照我的「娛樂救國」的方法來實行，那麽「航空救國」的成功，也不在遠了。</p>
<p>註：熱血和熱力，不能互離，所以我把它並用了。</p>
<h3 id="c201">美的相對論 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— 阿唐</p>
<p>「美」是相對的，不是絕對的，人類，也可以説各種動物，因爲種種關係，審美的觀念也各有不同。</p>
<p>鷄，犬，和山上的雉，在人類看來，固然雄的比雌的美，但是世界上的生物，同性相斥，異性相引，是一定的道理，所以在雄的鷄，犬，和雉的自已的心目中，恐怕雌的並不像人類所感覺的比雄的醜，否則，雄的何以爲追求雌的呢？你爲追求一個你心目中的醜婦嗎？</p>
<p>菲洲的土婦，在開化的人類看來，當然是醜的了不得；而在菲洲的土人的觀感上，也一定很美麗的。</p>
<p>六七十歲的老先生，看見了摩登女子有的會摇頭嘆息，説！「現在眞是世道日非，年輕的姑娘們打扮得不僧不道，」這原因是由於老年人生理的衰退；二則是他們在少年時的潮流不同，所以他們的審美觀念也和現在的年輕人兩樣，我想他們在年靑的時候，對於小脚的，病態美的女性，也很熱烈地追求着吧。</p>
<p>不上高山，不見平地，你一向目爲最美的，在你發現了更美的以後，一定要因之减色了，世界上因之起了不少的波動。</p>
<p>所以，世界上的所謂「美」是没有固定的標準的。</p>

<p>吳「先生！下週星期二的學期考試，題目請出得容易些，最好請指出範圍，」吳先生才進敎室，照例把名點過，一個學生就立起來説。</p>
<p>「現在天氣這樣冷，先生！你看窓外雪深，已近一尺，人家圍着火爐，還要不住地呌冷，我們坐在冷冰冰地自修室裏，十多種功課，每課至少有三四十頁都要在下週考完，現在一頁一頁地翻，已經手凍僵了，倘再要完全記在頭腦裏，那不是要我們的命了？先生！好在你這門歷史，不關重要，請你積積德，指出一個範圍，」這個學生不等吳先生回答，滔滔地續説。</p>
<p>兩個矛盾的印象，浮現在李先生的腦際：</p>
<p>丨丨前天開校務會議，蔣校長很嚴肅地説：「現在廳裏對於各校學生的課業，考察非常認眞，最近有一個通令，説是各門考試，絕對不許指出範圍，關於這一層，務請諸位切實留意，絲毫不得通融。丨丨</p>
<p>丨丨上學年暑假考試，普一的學生，要求陸先生指出範圍，固執的陸先生，絕對不許，結果，全級學生三十五人中，有十六人不及格，竟因此激起全校學生的狂潮，起了陸先生一個「莫須有」的罪名，説是陸先生所授的課，完全聽不明瞭，從此全體不上陸先生的課蔣校長本是陸先生的同學，也愛莫能助，結果，還是陸先生捲行李回府。丨丨</p>

<p>第一回推食殷勤偏邀貧女憶入門慷慨别具武夫雄</p>
<p>趙連長一看他，長長的眉毛，大大的眼睛，一張鵝蛋式的臉，幾乎有三分之二的所在，擦了胭脂，在額頭前面，蓋了一層劉海黑髪，後面拖了一把長黑的辮子，長長的旗袍，拖平靑鞋白襪子的脚背。只在這幾點上，活現出伊是一個旗族的舊式女子來。趙自强知道旗族人家，是十分講規矩的，不便對人家内室，對大姑娘多談什麽，便點頭道：不必客氣了。剛才我和你老太太談過，以後家父搬進來了，一切的事情，還要多多照應。我是不大能常回家，就是回家來了，待一會兒就得走。老姑娘看他雖是粗眉大眼的黑漢子，面團團的，倒也帶有幾分忠厚之象。靠後一步，低了頭笑道；你客氣。趙自强却也偏過了身子，側着走出門來。江氏和他談了幾句話，看他彬彬有禮。這印象越發的好了，一直送到大門口來。趙自强就站着。攔住伊不讓送。笑道：明天上午，家父就要由城裹搬到這兒來，假使我没有趕到，拜託老太太，和我照顧一點。家父今年已經六十八歲，雖然精神還康健，究竟上了幾歲年紀，總怕有些不方便的所在。江氏道：既然彼此是街坊，那總彼此有個照應的，你放心得了。趙自强笑嘻嘻的，走出大門來，然後向伊立正舉了一個手，才來回身上馬。正當他上馬的時候，却有一輌汽車，來勢非常之猛的，向馬身上一撞。那馬已吃了一驚，跟着身子一閃。趙自强是剛上馬的人，在鞍子上還不會坐定，這樣一閃，就把他閃着向前，一栽直栽到大門邊石階上來。那開汽車的見惹出了禍事，想要逃走，正好有一羣駱駝，慢慢的迎面走來，擋住了去路，只得將車子停住了。趙自强跳了起來，站到車子邊上，抓住司機的汽車夫道：你下來，我有話和你説。那汽車夫看這個樣子，料是强硬不過去，只得隨着他走了下來。（一○）</p>

<p>— 鵑雲</p>
<p>關陷了！寇深了！大戰已一觸即發！然在婦女之中少不了替父從軍的花木蘭，勤王剿寇的秦良玉，也許我們在舞台上，演義小説上已見過：「跨着桃花馬，握着九龍刀，女將威風，一馬當先，與賊人大戰這們百十來個回合。」</p>
<p>就是現在也不少看見！穿着高統皮靴，全身軍裝，佩了武裝帶的女軍官，一樣是雄糾糾，氣昂昂；槍桿兒描準了敵人的致命線，「一人當關，萬夫莫敵。」來一個殺一個，那怕倭子能逃上天去！</p>
<p>雖祇有小部份婦女能如此，在這大部份一些都市鄉間的諸姑姊妹何嘗没有一般重要和任務丨「後方工作」。</p>
<p>在上次歐洲大戰時，歐洲婦女很能堅忍耐苦，做了許多偉大驚人的工作丨</p>
<p>救護了戰線上抬回來的傷兵，供給了在前敵勇士們的糧食槍械；因爲維持地方市政的安全，而組織了完備的女警隊，女保衛團：始終不能廢弛的金融商業，「農」「工」「商」無一處不需要着女子。</p>
<p>我們中國婦女的能力，並不比人落後，何嘗不如歐洲婦女。那們不妨閉着眼思忖一下，似乎今後的責任，每一個婦人都擔着一副不輕的擔子！</p>
<p>可是回顧到一些都市裏的姊妹，依舊是祇顧到打扮得花枝招展，看電影，打麻雀，消磨着一些無聊的光陰，一點也不曾想到敵人已打進了我家的大門！</p>
<p>或者在平津一帶的姊妹已經感受到深切的恐怖，急忙忙望南逃，求着暫時的安全。</p>
<p>祇是在南省或是到了南省的人，便以爲一時安逸，便可以高枕無憂，落得做一個逍遥快樂的優閒者；一些也没有整備，一些也不覺悟！</p>
<p>吾們還不能健忌一二八在上海殘毁的遺跡！</p>
<p>倭賊的暴行劣跡是人人都已領敎過的。</p>
<p>難道非要敵人殺到身眼前，不會覺悟？我想婦女們不會這們笨！</p>
<p>我很知道要是有一個小偷，手裏也不必帶什麽兇器，至多一把雪亮的尖刀，要是光顧到無論那一個姊妹的家裏，十個中一定有九個祇會嚇得身子打戰，一點主意也没有。</p>
<p>其實恐怖畏縮何補於事！自然是凡事有了相當的準備，臨時便不致於心忙意亂。</p>
<p>那們目下所需的實習與努力，「千鈞一髪」已不容再有什麽遲疑與延擱，</p>
<p>我們也曾見到一般代表婦女團體的「婦女協會」已有不少進行的工作，在現在高唱航空救國的實現，也建議着籌購「女子號」飛機。</p>
<p>按照二萬萬女同胞計算，似乎購一架飛機不費什麽吹灰之方，平均就算每人捐洋一分，便可以籌集二百萬。十三四架飛機輕而易舉，每一個婦女祇須省三個銅子。</p>
<p>那們摩登女士們少添一樣化妝品，少置一身新裝，少看一次電影，少燙一次頭髪。信佛的太太們。移出一半佛前香敬，家裏少吃幾天肉，也一樣是功德無量。靠着十指針線生活的姊妹，多辛苦一夜半宵，省下一些救國儲金。好門牌的可以歇手了，你倘若把你預備做賭本的錢能完全捐去，或者到可以省你許多錢，至少也省得東欠一元，西欠幾角的零碎債務。</p>
<p>當優閒時未始不能優閒，「國難臨頭」，「切膚之痛」，同舟共濟的人羣，不應再有一切偷閒苟安的生活！</p>

<p>— 龐京周</p>
<p>第四章　業務之情形</p>
<p>（附註）上期文中所稱南市公立上海醫院，於傳染病流行時期，酌收時疫病人，乃是年前的事，如今該院時疫部新屋業已落成，設備大都改進，對於大傳染病患者，已經可以常年接受了。又閘北公立醫院於戰事以後，亦經重興而改善，這兩個消息，都是上海市民的福音。</p>
<p>如今再談新醫界個人的業務，上次早已説過新醫的總數，在上海假定與人民數比較，已經不嫌少，但因爲社會上人偏向舊醫的緣故，所以新醫每個人的業務，並不是平均狠發逹的。因業務上的競爭，而被迫到用些開業術，也是理所必然，開業術無非迎合社會上的心理，若説在應對病家的言詞舉止方面，表示圓融，和藹，親善等等，本與醫家的身分學術上，絲毫没有搖動，也是天下開業醫應取的態度。但在中國却有時因爲要圓融。而發生十二分困難。例如病家兼請了新舊醫，而拿舊醫的藥方，請新醫斟酌，問他應吃不應吃？或者問假使同服中西藥，可有什麽流弊？這一類的問題，實使新醫毫無答復的可能。最誠實而不欺人的答案，就是「不知道」三字。於是乎病家却嫌那新醫不學無術，太没有負責的答復。盛名之下的新醫，在這種爲難的境况之下，往往將病人放棄，而用「另請高明四字爲脫身之計，然而詬病他的同道，也可以責備他「不負責」或「舊醫化」，但是我嘗細想這種情形，也决不是醫家病家任何一方面可以造成的。至於開業術的下焉者，就不免帶投機色彩，例如社會上那一種疾病最多，就拿那一種病爲題目，招攬生意。像現在的上海，是生活困難而風氣淫靡的都市，所以患花柳病神經衰弱的人很多，於是腦病性病的幌子，遂如雨後春笋，失意的商人，荒唐的靑年，却也趨之若騖，。肺病是全世界的大敵，尤其是都會爲甚，所以上海也狠多，非專家而稱治肺專家的，實在和腦病性病同一滑稽。依我想來，上海四季都有特種的流行病，那麽醫界臉皮老一點，不妨做換季的專家，春天稱白喉腥紅專家；四五月稱痧痘幼科專家；夏天稱霍亂吐瀉專家；秋天稱痢瘧專家；倒也未爲不可！新近醫師公會議决，將要限制正式醫師的廣告，不許胡稱科目，即使眞正專家，必須以醫學學制上確有此一門專科者爲標準，乃是很規矩的辦法。　　開業醫本來可以大别分爲二類：一是統治各科的；一是專門家。專門家自然是少數，而統治各科的，當然佔多數，在理凡是普通醫師，遇到疑難症候，因學術和設備上的關係，應該將這個病人介紹給專家去治，然而在上海目下的情形，却還没有到這個程度。除却少數極有智識而極有資産的人，就診於專家之外，此外也不過就診於普通醫師，而普通醫師，因爲業務不十二分發逹，也未必能放着生意不做，而將重症一一介紹與專家。（按正式醫師各科例須及格，方准開業，各科輕症，本來可以治的。）而况上海各科專家，究竟完備不完備？好不好？也還是個疑問，所以實際上也難辦到，而病人的知識和經濟力量，是否都能受專家療治？也有關係。我親歷的三椿事，實可以做此説的左證：（一）有一次我偶然替一個患痔瘡者解除了相當的痛苦，他便介紹了很多患痔瘡的來，以爲我是痔瘡專家了，其實單單痔瘡一病，並不列爲專科，我更非痔瘡專家，但因此我得了相當經騐，而一部份最棘手的病人，仍舊介紹到了他處去；（二）有一次，有一家病家請了一位舊醫治瘧疾，而一定要託我介紹一個西洋醫師，專治瘧疾去，會診瘧疾，並無專科，我也只得圓融地介紹了一位内科先生去；（三）一家病家的女太太，一定要求一位外國女醫師而開腹手術超超等的，説是男子開刀，似乎不雅，我只得以「上海缺貨」謝絕了。（本章未完）</p>
<h3 id="c207">痰説四 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 余雲岫</p>
<p>然則舊醫痰病之説，終不可得而理歟，曰，析之而已矣，析之之道，先在正名，名正。則諸病可以各從其類，不至遊魂無歸，羣居而雜處矣，茲姑從近代舊醫之稱，定膠固稠粘者爲痰，淸而稀薄者爲飮，則舊醫之所謂痰者，即今日科學醫之所謂粘液也，人身産生粘液之處有二，其一爲上皮細胞，其二爲結締組織，由上皮細胞産生者，曰上皮細胞性粘液，由結締織産生者，曰結締織性粘液，而上皮細胞性粘液，産自粘液膜及粘液腺，人身之肉皮，具有粘膜及粘腺，而能分泌粘液者，如口鼻，咽，喉，氣管，食道，胃，腸，尿道，子宫頸，耳内歐氏管等皆是，結締織性粘液。則在於關節膜，滑液囊，腱鞘，而胎兒之臍帶中，胎生初期之皮下組織，亦粘液也。</p>
<p>在生理範圍之内，諸有粘膜粘腺之處，有常常分泌少量粘液者，小腸及子宫頸等是也，有絕不分泌粘液者，如鼻，氣管等是也，到疾病之時，則分泌少量者而變爲大量，如痢時之便，及子宫頸管性白帶是也，不分泌者而變爲分泌，如鼻涕及濁唾是也，更有無粘液細胞之處，不能産生粘液者，而變爲産生液粘，如粘液癌是也，故病理學上，凡不分泌粘液之處而分泌粘液，及分泌少量之處而分泌多量者，皆可謂之「粘液變性，」然則以廣義言之，凡粘液變性之病，皆可謂之痰病矣，其最著者，諸種粘膜炎，如鼻加答兒，咽喉加答兒，氣管，支氣管，食道，胃，腸，尿道，子宫頸等加答兒，皆痰病矣，而各處粘膜發炎之原因，爲各種化學物理等刺戟，及各種病菌，如流行性感冒菌，白喉菌，結核，梅毒，淋菌，霍亂菌，痢疾菌等是也，非七情六淫，勞傷飲食之謂也。</p>
<p>此外則如粘液水腫，粘液腫瘤，及各種粘液混合瘤，粘液癌，卵彚囊瘤，亦皆爲痰病矣。</p>
<p>此外則急性神經障碍之時，氣管食道中臨時分泌之粘液，如中風癲癇等及心臟衰弱時所發者，舊醫則以爲風痰驚痰矣，然此等分泌液，多爲漿液性，屬之飲病，差爲相近，謂爲痰病，實不相附，且此等分泌液，乃因中風癲癇而後産生，非先有痰而後發爲病也。</p>
<p>以上所舉者，吾名之曰廣義之痰，至如世俗之所謂欬痰吐痰等痰，則專指呼吸器中所分泌之粘液而言，古之所謂濁唾涎沬者也，吾名之曰狹義之痰。</p>
<p>然無論其爲廣義之痰，狹義之痰，其病之本體各有所在，而不相統屬，病之原因亦各有所在，而不相統屬，其共同所有之現象，則産生粘液而已，夫粘液者，有病而後生，乃病之一種生産物，非病之主體也，故今日之學科　，雖知幾種疾病，有能産生粘液者，而無專立一「粘液病」名目之可能及必要，此可由上之所述而明白曉知者也，然則舊醫「痰病」之名目，至不合理，整理國故者，所當削而棄之也。</p>
<p>至於因痰而生之病候，在鼻粘膜炎則有頭痛，鼻塞，語聲如在甕中等候，然鼻加等答兒之頭痛，或是腦膜側性充血，或是漿液性炎症，尙屬未决之問題，要之，乃粘膜炎之影響，非其所分泌之粘液之影響也，在耳歐氏管炎則有重聽，在氣管及支氣管炎則有欬喘氣促，在咽喉則有嘔惡，在胃則有脹滿，不下食等候，在腸則有泄痢，在前陰則有淋濁帶下及攝護腺漏，在關節則有歷節腫痛，在皮下則爲粘液水腫，種種病候亦各有所在，而不相統屬，皆宜分隸於各病之下，則條分縷析，無雜亂混淆之虞，不得混立一「痰病」之目，而取一切粘膜</p>
<h3 id="c208">通信問病之利害 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>爲免除内地病家有病無醫的困難，爲解决貧苦病家有病無力求醫的困難，於是各種新舊藥學刊物上，特闢出醫藥顧問一欄，給予病家一個通訊問病的便利。尤其是各日報的醫藥附升。</p>
<p>除了以上這兩個單純的意見之外，還有兩個重大的意義：（一）普遍的宣傳醫藥學常識，以求逹到醫藥學民衆化。（二）對於疑難的問題，可以公開研究。</p>
<p>這不能不算是人類的福音了！但是細細地考察，在這種人類的福音中間，多少包含一點危險的性質。現在從醫病從藥方本身上設想，有以下兩個問題。</p>
<p>我們不是爲免除内地病家有病無醫和解决貧苦病家有病無力求醫的困難嗎？但是我們展開了報紙一看，問病者何嘗皆是内地的和貧苦的呢？這實在給病家一個狡滑的鄙吝的有病不求醫的機會了！在病家以爲一紙的空文，就可以得到治療上的解决、以狠有限的數分郵票，就可以換得他的生命的安全，痛苦的消失，天下有這樣便宜的事嗎？内地旣非完全没有醫生、問病者又非完全貧苦，有了這樣一個便宜病家的機會，於是内地的開業醫師無形中受到重大的損失，而我們忠實的醫藥刊物的主編者也就無形中爲狡獪的病家所利用了！</p>
<p>醫生對於病家，負有重大的責任，無任病症的大小，醫生皆須經過精密的實地診察，纔能有正確的診斷與處方。所以診斷病症，不能全將病人口頭的報告，至於形於紙墨，那更是不足恃的了！在這種變化莫測的病情中間，憑着病人的一紙來書，即予以一個治療上的答復，固然，病人的報告是不見得完全與病情相符，即使完全相符，而在這一種往返的問答中，病情也許起了特殊的變化，在病家是不知道有危險的，在醫家不是「雖曰愛之，其實害之」嗎？</p>
<p>天下的事不是祗有利没有弊的，所以，通信問病也不是絶對不可能的。我所希望於醫藥刊物的主編者啊！對於通訊問病是要取極審愼的態度，然後所得的結果，纔不至於與造福人類的原意相違。尤其要有透明的觀察，纔不至爲病家所朦蔽，而有損於内地同道的利權。</p>
<p>至如以此爲個人宣傳或推銷外藥的工具，則更不足道了。</p>

<p>（丙）分娩第二期……娩出期</p>
<p>分娩第二期陣痛，謂之娩出期陣痛，此期之子宫口已開大，卵胞已破裂，兒頭進入陰道，嗣後陣痛，專爲排出胎兒之用，其時陣痛劇烈而頻仍，且持續甚長，往往誘起反射性的腹壓，以助兒頭之前進。</p>
<p>陣痛時兒頭下降，痛停時退縮，那時會陰延長，肛門哆開，直腸壁外翻，不但有便意，且有糞便漏出，以致陣痛愈甚，會陰更加膨脹，呈現球形，兒頭頭蓋之一部，排開陰唇，陣痛稍停時，兒頭向後退縮，陰唇（裂口）又閉鎖，陣痛愈强，兒頭愈加前進，以致陰門異常緊張，其時產婦疼痛旣劇，努力亦愈甚，頓見顏面潮紅，眼光熌灼，口唇紅紫而乾燥，脈搏頻數，手指尖上，有微細動脈管的波動，可見全身用力的緊張、同時；全身發汗，陣痛再來時，全身震顫，此時雖在陣痛間歇，而兒頭不再後退，當即露出於陰門之外，俗稱露頂的當口，外陰部緊張已達極點，產婦不勝痛苦，呼號不止，甚至亦有失去知覺的，兒頭即於此時娩出，或更有二三次陣痛，那末；就可完全產出，胎兒在呱呱聲中，宣告出世了。</p>
<p>（丁）分娩第三期……後產期</p>
<p>胎兒產出後，胎盤與卵膜，經過二十分或三十分排出，或同時排出，但在胎盤排出時，乃起後產期陣痛，專使子宫收縮，壓出胎盤，而呈球形之狀，於是分娩自此終了。</p>
<p>▲答墜胎之請求者</p>
<p>近來接讀請求墜胎之函件。月必數起。雖所陳理由。無非體虚力弱。對於生育。難以勝任。殊不知墜胎一事。非但危險孔多。不在小產之下。且於刑法。尤所違背。吾輩醫師。以人道主義爲根本。非惟本人絶對不許爲人墜胎。且常警告社會。力避墜胎之危險。若有不顧危險。貿然墜胎。則抵觸刑法。摧殘生命。害莫甚焉。我國刑法。對於墮胎之處罪。不啻三令五申。而意圖嘗試者。仍視若具文。用摘大要如左。</p>
<p>（一）懷胎婦女。服藥或以他法墮胎者。處一年以下有期徒刑拘役。或三百元以下罰金。懷胎婦女。聽從他人墜胎者亦同。（分則三○四條）</p>
<p>（二）受懷胎婦女之囑託。或得其承諾而使之墮胎者。處二年以下有期徒刑。因而致婦女於死者。處五年以下有期徒刑。（分則三○五條）</p>
<p>（三）意圖營利。而犯前條第一項之罪者。處六月以上五年以下有期徒刑。得併科五百元以下罰金。（分則三○六條）</p>
<p>（四）以文字圖畫或他法。公然介紹墮胎之方法或物品。或公然介紹自己或他人爲墮胎之行爲者。處一年以下有期徒刑拘役。得併科或易科一千元以下罰金。（分則三○八條）</p>
<p>以上所述。不過聊代答復。嗣後恕不一一函答。諸希鑒原爲幸。（完）</p>
<h3 id="c211">哮喘症略談 <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— 侯光迪</p>
<p>哮喘症西名亞司馬Asthma。希臘文　義即我被打擊之謂。此症之最顯徵象。即呼吸困難而兼特異之喘息聲。發作時間大半在夜間二時。忽然驚醒。非壘枕起坐。不能呼吸。漸愈喘愈急。至最劇烈之時。幾若氣絶垂危。乃忽復轉佳。故老於此症者。常習見此等危象不甚駭異。此症爆發。具間歇性。但距離長短不一。亦有先患感冒氣管支炎及消化不良。因而發作者。</p>
<p>經度之哮喘。祗有呼吸困難而己。重者四支發冷。週身盜汗。兼有嘔吐。經二三小時。方漸寛鬆吐出粘痰。始歸平息。至是患者倦乏已甚。遂獲安睡。次日其病若失矣。然大多數常患氣管支炎而咳嗆多痰。亦有患消化不良者。</p>
<p>患痛風症Gont及易起濕疹之人。每兼患哮喘。往往兩症輪流發作。又胃酸過多。心躁食物不化。乃喘症常見之病患。梅毒與瘧疾亦釀喘症痛苦之一般。</p>
<p>喘症原因。人各一說。有歸咎于血者。有言腦神經失常者。第以徵象而論。當喘作之時。明明腦神經之拘攣中樞。喚起拘攣作用。使氣管支週圍肌。作拘攣性之收縮。而拘攣中樞所以如是者。必血内之不潔有以致之。</p>
<p>除此之外。尙有種種外因。如空氣之變換。塵埃。與花卉粉蕊之觸及。禽類與動之腥臭。庖廚烹煑食物之油味。與香水之董灑。皆足引起喘症。由是推想。食品之謬誤。當然爲誘因之一。故久患喘症者每能察知某種不相宜食物。而禁忌之以避免本症之發作。</p>
<p>此症具遺傳性者約有百分之四十。</p>
<p>治法分根治及急治兩種。根治須檢查患者有無他種病因。如梅毒腺病瘧疾痛風糖尿等。而醫治之。使腦神經免于刺激。又鼻腔之鼻菌。喉頭之喉蛾。亦爲釀發此症之因。須行割去。急治最好用麻黃精注射。或阿篤魯並鹽莫合併注射。及阿特倫那林互換注射。更以洋金花葉與硝浸紙。燒成黑烟。而薰之。往往立見奇效。</p>
<p>麻黃精乃由國產麻黃所製。用治喘症。具有特効。注射内服。各區皆備。外國藥廠。如茂孚。派克台維司。利來。兮默克等。皆有出品。新亞廠所製之品。亦甚精良。見効更速。余用之頗廣。從未失望。大可介紹於國人也。</p>

<p>— 陳小枚</p>
<p>宼氛日熾，國難益深，際此存亡絶續之間，救亡不暇，云何實業，云何抵制。詎知周君師洛，在此時期，救國不忘實業，夙興夜寐，不遺餘力，出其所學，籌設民生製藥廠於杭垣，從事製造藥物，醫療器械，玻璃料器等。</p>
<p>廢曆除夕，承盧君志學，吳君冠民之約，參觀該廠，得瞻周君風采，第覺周君和靄可親，承彼引導，指示無遺。足使吾人欽仰者，對於工塲佈置，器械設計，悉皆周君所自出心裁也。如蒸汽鍋所需爐，灶，烟突，大門之構造，利用學理，得以節省燃料。如安瓿之藥液充塡，利用打氣帮浦原理，每小時可裝一千枝至一千枝以上。杭垣無瓦斯，則用煤油燈，中通一孔，鼓以空氣，火焰大小，隨心所欲，效用一如本生燈。他如利用球胆，以代風　，而鼓空氣。諸如此類，不可勝舉。</p>
<p>該廠内分三部，即化學藥品部：醫療器械部：玻璃料器部。聘有專家多人，專事製造。茲將該廠槪况，摘述如下：</p>
<p>（一）化學藥品部</p>
<p>該部雖無大規模之裝置。然製造上應用之機械，頗稱完備。如自動錠劑機，混和機，丸藥機，糖衣機，打光機，油膏研磨機等，均由自製。注射藥室，全室設蒸汽裝置，有眞空蒸餾器，眞空洗滌器，安瓿充塡裝置（周君自製者）等。男女工人，均加訓練，一切操作，皆井然有序。該部近復製造必治瘉（Pityol）新藥一種，以抵制仇貨之Pityrol。行將陳列於芝加哥博覽會中也。</p>
<p>（二）醫療器械部</p>
<p>該部工人以廢曆年終皆回家過年，未得參觀，殊甚抱憾。</p>
<p>（三）玻璃料器部</p>
<p>該部備有熔爐，眞空帮浦，貯氣槽。專門製造中性硬質玻璃。如各種大小安瓿，牛苗管，血清瓶，試騐管，注射管，量杯，投藥瓶，安全漏斗，燒杯，乳鉢，漏斗，鐘形漏斗，燒瓶，圓底燒瓶等。海上雖有資本較大之玻璃瓶廠，出品之質地，未能若該廠之精良，可斷言也。</p>
<p>此外關於該廠出品，最著者有：Trypalin,　Vertodin,　Antihustin,　Pityol,　Oxytin,　Gimenor,　Salpalin,　Plolnichin,　Quinoblau,　Fiberung,　Digitolin.Magnol,等不下數百種，殆不知費去周君之幾許心血也！周君近復努力猛進，精益求精，勞心勞力之職業態度，未可以言語形容之。若周君者，可謂實業救國之有心人也！</p>

<p>在科學未發達，醫學還不能應用科學方法來研究來實騐的從前時節，當然是是非不白，眞僞莫明，那只有由他去臆猜，由他去說假。到了科學倡明的現代，醫學已能應用科學的方法來研究來實騐，故廢棄虚僞謬誤的舊醫，而應用正確合理的科學新醫，本是毫無疑義的事了。可是一般民衆，久受過去因襲的宣傳，不明瞭舊醫的謬誤和虚僞，而毫不自覺地以爲這種謬誤虚僞的舊醫理論是正確的，是合理的，一般不覺悟的舊醫們呢，總是不肯認清時代，承認舊醫的落伍，不肯服從眞理，承認舊醫的虚僞，反而積極地去把這種虚僞的僞醫理論，向社會宣傳造謠：辦報紙，辦學院，組織團體，來作反動運動。這一方面，因民衆過去數千百年留遺下來的因襲思想，故易爲古舊醫的說謊所麻醉，所欺蒙；他方面，舊醫就利用了民衆幼稚的思想，因襲的頭腦的這個弱點，而愈加施其欺羣惑衆的能事了，事實上，這種反動工作的結果，只有使民衆走入反健康的迷途上去。所以我們爲民衆的健康，國家民族的前途着想，應如河的來擔負起這個反舊醫的革命工作，來把舊醫的虚僞謊謬處，分析出來，去向民衆講解，向民間宣傳，而改變其過去的玄學頭腦，因襲思想的謬誤。必須要大多數的民衆，都感覺醒悟到過去舊醫的謬誤，才能發生對於科學新醫的信仰。玄學的頭腦，因襲的思想，决計裝置不進科學新醫的智識的！素不相信痰裏藏有無數彼此能互相傳染的結核菌的肺癆病人，要改正其隨地涕吐的陋習，是要更加的繁難。我們灌輸醫學常識於民衆的宣傳工作，是爲着增進民衆的康健的。要使民衆能接受能享用這醫學常識的福利，就不能避免的應作一番反舊醫的破壞工作。這項破壞舊醫的革命工作，其性質其意義的重要性，不在上述所謂救治民衆疾苦和灌輸醫藥智識的二個任務之下！這個攸關國家前途的重大任務，不應只是少數新醫分子的任務，而是每個新醫分子的任務，新醫界全體醫師的任務！（完）</p>

<p>▲金之逃亡與呆藏　金本位制之動搖、論者多歸因於金之逃亡與呆藏、考世界貨幣用現金、一九二五年末爲一○、二四四百萬元（美金）一九二八年末爲一一、○五二百萬元、一九二二年六月末爲一二、○七八百萬元、其增加率誠屬不大、以當代世界通賣總計之、自不足維持原有之準備率、且其中之存在美國者、一九二五年末爲四、三九九百萬元、一九二八年末爲四、一四一百萬元、一九三一年六月爲四、九五六百萬元、其中之存在法國者、一九二五年末爲九七八百萬元、一九二八年末一、二七一百萬元、一九三一年六月爲二、二一二百萬元、美法二國之存金、蓋自世界總額中之百分五○左右、增加至百分六○左右焉、此都因戰債賠欵、短期資金等之收回、而自各國流入者、一九三一年下半年後、美國步减、而法國則激增、世界存金之大宗、仍在此二國之手、計一九三二年末、美國約四、五○○百萬元、法則超過八百三十萬法郎、此外各國乃大都减少、日本自一九二八年末之五四一百萬元（美金）减至一九三一年六月之四二四百萬元、一九三二年末尤减、僅得日金四二五百萬元、德國自一九二八年末之六七六百萬元（美金）减至一九三一年六月末之三五九百萬元、一九三二年尤减、僅得七萬九千萬馬克、英國尙平穩、面爲額則不大、一九二五年末爲八一四百萬元、（美金）一九二八年末爲八三六百萬元、一九三一年六月末爲八六五百萬元、一九三二年末爲一萬一千萬鎊、就大勢以觀、金之逃向美法等國、無可諱言、日本德國及英國等、究不免相形見絀、此外則更無論已、夫金本位制度者、以現金爲主幣者也、國内之兌換賴之、國際之清算亦賴之、所謂溝通國際經濟之運河者、此之謂也、今乃少數國保有巨額、多數國存底日薄、此多數國之金本位、安得而維持、當此世界金產額不振之時、復有金之逃亡、誠金本位制度之不幸也、</p>
<p>國際間之存金、不爲均匀之分布、而形成逃亡之局勢、旣足懼矣、然此逃亡之金、若流入有用之途、則猶可說也、不幸收受此金者、又大都呆藏、於是金之實效愈低、金本位之基礎亦愈危、依據統計、自一九二八年以還、美法二國之金準備額、常超過其紙幣流通額、美國十二個聯邦準備銀行之金準備額、在一九二八年末得聯邦準備券及存欵額之百分六一·五、一九二九年末得百分之六九·六、一九三○年且超過百分之七十、嗣後漸减、而一九三一年末尙得百分之六一·九焉、法蘭西銀行之金準備額、在一九　八年末得銀行券及存欵額之百分七九·九、一九三一年末得百分之八○·九、前者約超過法定準備率之三分一、而後者且超過法定準備率之一倍有餘也、故在美法二國、存金多而呆、社會信用並不因金之增加而敏活、市面通貨亦並不因金準備之豐富而增加、換言之、卽其金本位制度下之通貨、並未隨其實存之現金而有所伸縮也、金本位之實效、蓋亦僅矣、至若其他各國、則金旣逃亡矣、歷來以金本位爲根據之信用及通貨、自不免日益發生破綻、駸漸而舉世金融枯禁焉、物價下落焉、經濟恐慌焉、蓋三四年於此矣、論者於金本位制之動搖、每歸因於金之逃亡與呆藏、良有以也、</p>
<p>▲世界經濟恐慌爲因乎？爲果乎？由前之說、金本位之動搖、似由於金之逃亡與呆藏、而世界經濟之恐慌、究爲因乎、抑爲果乎、是猶不可以不論也、或曰、在金本位制之信用組織下、信用之伸縮、向以金準備爲衡、近年來金旣發生逃亡與呆藏、大多數國家存金日少、存金少、則信用緊縮、金融梗塞、而物價下落、經濟恐慌起矣、湯生（Albert　Tanssen）、孟德（Reginald　Mant）、司托納荷基（Henry　Strakosch）等、皆主此說者也、此輩以爲自各國須解戰債、賠欵與美法、世界用金乃有逃亡之趨勢、一九二八年後、美法不獨不向各國放出資金、且又收回其他債權、世界用金之分布、自益不均、世界經濟、自不免恐慌、國聯金委員會報告書中言之詳矣、此說蓋以金本位制之動搖、爲世界經濟恐慌之原因　或又曰、自歐戰媾和以後、各國之經濟政策、頓換一新局面、戰前之國際分工、漸爲人所唾棄、國家資本主義、日益抬頭、主持一國之經濟政策者、始也莫不努力求本國原料及製品之自給自足、對於輸入品、多方限制、繼也又極力對外傾銷、務求本國產業之榮長、故各國之生產設備無不擴張、固定資本、寞不增加、保護關稅、又莫不奉行、至近年而益烈、據美國商務部報告、一九三零年之一年間、歐洲各國一般的提高稅率、數在六數以上、拉丁美利堅一般的提高稅率、先後共計五數、漸至國際間之壁壘高築、以相互傾銷始者、竟以相互停滯終、國際貿易、大見减色、試列世界四十八國各個上半年之貿易如左、（單位百萬馬克）</p>
<p>一九二八年　一九三一年　一九三二年</p>

<p>輸出　　五七·一　　三六·一　　二三·七</p>
<p>合計　一二一·二　　七七·八　　五一·二</p>
<p>國際貿易衰落、對外銷路阻塞、各國之生產設備、亦頓成呆資、熟練工人、紛紛失業、經濟恐恐乃成普遍的現象、債務國對於美法等債權國、旣無新生國際貸借足以抵償、自不得出於輸送現金之一途、於是金貨逃亡、而金本位制終於動搖、此說也、蓋以經濟恐慌爲因、而金本位制之動搖爲果、</p>
<p>上述二說、其因果觀念、絶對不同、而後者之之說、較爲有理、蓋自各國間發生猛烈之關稅戰爭、世界經濟、已失溝通性、且各國内部之生產設備、徒爲過度的擴張、政府並無遂行、「統制經濟」之能力、在各個之工場公司内、雖日見科學化、並日見合理化、而在整個國家内、則愈見其不科學化、不合理化、在此類經濟組織下、欲免爲恐慌得乎、洎乎世界經濟恐慌之機已兆、貨弊金融、本當動搖、况以近年國際貸借之不平均、金之逃亡與金本位制之動搖、宜其爲普通的現金焉、</p>
<p>▲美國竟自食其果　美本債務國也、地雖大物雖博、而在世界金融上本無甚權感、歐戰而後、地位丕變、對外債權旣日大、金元王國之雄風、遂威震全球、華爾街之代朗巴街、以爲世界金融之中心者、幾將二十年矣、近四五年來、其存金之巨、尤足駭人、去年以還、始現减少之傾向、設能善用其地位、以謀世界經濟之溝通、未始不足以有爲也、不幸其對於各國、出以榨取政策、在其本身則保護關稅之增高、生產設備之擴張、惟恐或後、卒至世界經濟衰落、輸出激减、其國内先見枯緊、近一年内、且成現金流出之形勢、以致國内人心、愈見震動、而形成近頃之恐慌、雖存金尙大、而恐慌旣起、人心浮動、已非此準備金所能蕩平、其金本位制度、乃不得不出於停止、露骨言之、雖謂爲自食其果可也、或謂　國此次恐慌、而若干原因出於戰債之不克如期收回、此說誠不爲無理、然使戰債如期收回、亦僅足形成目前之餘裕耳、其他各國旣以償債而益見貧乏、世界經濟之恐慌、必發生深刻化、美國之對外貿易、必愈形不振、其生產資本、必愈形呆置、雖欲避免恐慌、尙可得乎、其金本位制之終不免動搖、理也亦勢也、抑尤有進者、近數年來金價之上漲、表面上似爲金之逃亡所致、實則尙有二原因焉、（一）金之呆藏、美法二國存金最多而最不流用、換言之、卽最不願依賴存金、擴充其信用、以謀貨幣金融之敏活、美國直至最近發生恐慌、始有發行政府紙幣之議、誠使此舉早行、則銀行庫存之金雖不免因流通市面而减少、而此次恐慌、未始不可鬆緩也、（二）價格之硬抬、美以存金最多、遇金價下落、輒恐其有損於己而收買之、故金之集於美者甚多、不料存金多則資力呆置、竟不免形成恐慌之發生、其近頃金本位制之動搖、謂爲自食其果、不益宜乎、今者美國似以通貨澎脹政策、爲救濟恐慌之骨幹矣、此乃經濟史上常用之法、但祗能取效於一時、設無其他有效的整理方法隨其後、我人終不信其爲可恃也、當此世界經濟暗淡之秋、美國之恐慌究能卽見穩定乎、其金本位制究能終免於動搖乎、遙瞻自由女神、誠不勝其悲觀也、</p>

<h3 id="c215">美國金融風潮之成因 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 茅震初</p>
<p>此次突如其來之美國金融潮、有如狂風暴雨之自天而降、莫知所以、然吾人若將美國最近國内各穩經濟的社會的政治的現象、稍加剖析、當可知此次風潮之所由發生、實自有其不可避免之結果在也、</p>
<p>（一）（債權失效）　原夫美國之繁榮、乃受歐戰時運之賜、當在歐戰以前、美國本爲世界最大債務國、戰後因乘各國缺乏生產能力之機會、得儘量發展其出口貿易、溯自一九一五年（卽大戰開始後一年）起、其對外貿易額已自十四萬萬元躍至二十八萬萬元、恰增一倍、翌年、歐戰方殷、美國輸出歐洲大批食料及軍火、更一躍而爲五十萬萬元、又幾增一倍、一九二○年（休戰後二年）歐洲各國以癐痍未復、無力生產、此時美國之對外貿易總額竟到達八十二萬萬元之最高紀錄、在此六年間、由外國流進美國之金錢、如此之多、其由貧困而趨入繁榮、自何待言、然自此之後、一方因歐洲現金漸告涸竭、凡與美國交易、除賒欠的「債權」外、别無現金可償、一方彼等國家之生產能力亦逐次恢復、美國出口貿易隨而漸减、美國收入外來之金錢乃日見其稀少矣、卽有所收入、莫非賬面的債權、同時美國直接由戰爭所放出英法等國之債務、爲數可百億餘元、而此項戰債之償付、全視德國能否履行英法等國賠欵義務爲定、目前德國旣無力清償賠欵、遂影響英法等國償付美國戰債之信用、造成連鎖的僵局、其最後之受害者爲握有世界債權之美國、是以美國之繁榮、嚴格言之、自一九二一年以後、早呈空虚的現象、其繁榮旣築於債權、一遇債務不能收還之時、全國金融自必蹈入週轉不靈之局面、一九二九年有股票之風潮、何怪四年後的今日卒以債權之無着而發生恐慌也、</p>
<p>（二）（財政虧損）　美國財政上歲出數額、在戰前僅十億左右、戰後卽一躍至四十億以上、所增加之三十億中、約三分之一爲負擔之國債費、蓋大戰時美國之戰費消耗四百四十億元以上、大部由　數國債而來、一九一九年國債最高額可二百五十五億之鉅、每年還本付息自是艱困、收入方園、約計關稅爲六億元、其他則爲所得稅等、而戰前主要收入之烟草、酒精、酒等稅、戰後全生變化、尤其酒稅一種、自施行禁酒法後、激减　四千萬左右、所得稅等亦激减異常、同時軍費之支出一九二六年尙爲百分之一六、一九三○年擴大至百分之二○、去年會計年度（一九三一年度）軍費預算且爲八億一千四百二十七萬四千元、可見美國財政上、收入方面稅收有逐年激减之勢、支出方面所擔負巨額之國債費及軍費、反與年俱增、故自一九三一年起、早現捉襟見肘之態、近年來每届議會之重要議題、厥惟如何塡補財政虧損、以國庫之收支不平衡、對於國家發行之債券、難免不减少信用、直接影響以債券爲準備之金融界也、</p>
<p>（三）（貿易不振）　自歐戰以後、美國對外貿易似可劃分爲三個時期、一九一五至一九二一年可謂全盛時期、一九二二年至一九二九年爲减退期、一九三○至一九三二年爲不振期、其全盛也實受歐洲大戰缺乏生產品之賜、其减退也亦由於歐洲各國已能自行生產、而輸出隨之减少、至於一九三○年以來之不振現象、則完全受世界恐慌之影響也、據統計報告美國近三年來之對外貿易比較一九二九年約減少三分之一、然一九二九年已入於減退之期、以故有識者莫不爲之擔慮、甚至有謂若令此種狀態長久保持、則至一九三三年九月、美國對外貿易將完全消滅、雖未免言之過甚、然此種不振之程度、可想而知、夫美國對外貿易之增减、關係於傭金利潤與僱用問題者匪淺、蓋美國全國持國外貿易爲生者、據云至少有二百四十萬家、茲各國均以「不景氣」的襲擊、莫不競謀保護國内市塲、或提高稅率或施行「分配制」、（按卽分别限定各國之輸入額）藉以限制進口、使美國貿易、一敗塗地、而持此爲生之美國對外貿易商安得不陷於困難之狀態、並連帶及於全國之景氣哉、</p>
<p>（四）（生產惡化）　受世界不景氣波盪之各工業國家、工業方面之生產量、當然爲之减退、據德國景氣研究所所發表、去年世界工業生產指數除蘇俄、印度、日本外、莫不退至與戰前相等、爲近十年來所僅見、卽以一九一三年爲一○○時去年則爲一○一、其中尤以德、美、波蘭等國爲甚、而美國之生產尤趨惡化、是美國工業方面、早已因世界之不景氣貿易之銳退隨時减縮、當然不致再有生產過剩之虞、但一般工業之不振、遂直接及於各項企業之虧損與金融界之拮据、同時、美國農業本稱發達、農產品中主要成分之小麥、更爲輸出之主要商品、去年美國糧食生產、總計在三十萬零四百萬美斛以上、祇以出口之不振、糧食頓見過剩、所有食料品價格猛烈傾跌、若以一九二九年爲一○○則去年小麥之價格僅爲五六·五、他若玉蜀黍等則僅六六·八、食料品價格之狂跌、勢必使整個農村經濟爲之破產、而農業恐慌以生、據統計所示全國農人所負債務、約二千餘萬萬元之驚人數目、農村恐慌之深刻程度、至於此極、由此看來、美國在生產方面受兩重壓逼、一、工業生產銳减、二、農業生產過剩、此兩種相爲矛盾的現象、動搖經濟組織的全體、金融上自無可避免此恐慌之一日也、</p>
<p>（五）（失業激增）　所謂世界恐慌、失業人羣之日趨衆多實開其端、早先世人莫不以美國爲世界富豪視之、孰知近年來失業之狂潮、已有席捲全美之勢、本年一月美國勞工協會主席格林氏曾宣稱、「美國失業羣衆已達一千一百六十萬人之最高峯、經濟財政恐慌已届三年之美國、失業者之出路已絶」云云、又據去年十二月末公益及救濟運動委員會主席牛頓貝克氏所言或竟有四分之一之人民全無收入而依賴其親戚朋友及社會失業基金以爲生活者、推究失業之原因、則工業生產之銳减、與夫農業生產之過剩、在在可以造成大衆的解雇、因此美之失業人數爲全世界第一位、比諸第二位德國之五百萬、恰爲一倍有餘、失業旣爲促成恐慌之重要因素、以一千萬之失業人羣間接增重四十八洲之恐慌、自在吾人意想之中、</p>
<p>上述種種悲　景象、日夕環侍於全美金融界四週、其風潮條件之成熟、蓋已不待於今日、箭在弦上、一觸卽發、勢所然也、祇以今日以前、　諸一架形式畢具之機器、祇缺少燃料推動、而今日其燃料且已具備矣、所謂燃料、福特汽車公司之向第答羅城聯保信托公司提取七百五十萬金元之存欵無着是也、政治上新舊總統之交替是也、銀行界現金之紛紛流出海外、清償對外短期債務是也、股票價格之狂跌又莫不是也、蓋美國股票市場、最近跌落之甚、比之去年九月、鐵路股約减百分之三九、工業股亦减百分之三五、而股票之與銀行界素有密切關係、股票大跌自是便銀行之放欵及信用、發生動搖、一般人民更鑒於政治上正在新舊總統交替時期、均猜疑新總統登躉或將變更財政、貨幣等等重要制度、發生不安心理、故一聞福特公司提疑無着之傳說、乘機紛向銀行提存、而銀行正當現金空虚之際、遂釀成此軒然大波、或謂福特公司與下臺之胡佛總統旣有相當　你、提欵一層、不免有政治作用、殊不知此種手段、損人不利己、自不致出此、不過因政治的變動、影響人民之心理、直接推動風潮、則爲吾人不可否認之事實也、抑此次風潮推動如此之速、對於銀行本身之制度、不無缺陷、蓋美國銀行爲　立制度、並　支店之設、有别於所設支店銀行、故全國一萬八千家大銀行、均各各獨立、不相　　、故一遇風潮、往往卽失週轉能力、不若英國等採行支店制度之銀行、可以藉各地支店之力、相互運用週轉、不致動輒被逼停業也、</p>
<h3 id="c216">停止金本位制後之英吉利 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— 石礎糶</p>
<p>自從一九三一年五月十二日德國金融恐慌爆發，牽動了英倫三島對外信用基礎以後，引動了德國資本逃避與各國對英投資收回的波瀾。加重了國際金移動的異態，致使英國不得不於一九三一年九月二十一日停止金本位制，並於二十三日在法律上限制外國匯兌。</p>
<p>然而自從停止金本位制至今，已一年又四月有餘。其影響於英國經濟界到怎樣的程度呢？事實上告訴我們，英國自從停止金本位制後，其影響於英國產業良好者極微，甚至不能獲到如英人所期待的效果。如金鎊價格在停止後兩個月間，已低落一零％。再如倫敦金融市塲金利的膽高，造成一八九七年以來，「破天荒」的現象，但這不自然的高利金，不外是因英蘭銀行欲防止通貨澎脹，而絶力限制貨出，於是致使紙幣流通額也就不能如前之增加。同時因物價高騰的結果，又須需巨額的資本。換句話說，停止金本位制的結果，勢必需增加資本，同時又因恐通貨澎脹，於是要提高金利。</p>
<p>關於國民生活費，據英政府勞工部調查的結果，自九月卽停止金本位制以來，並未昂貴。反之，批發物價在此期間已高騰一零％以上。並且不僅是原料品，卽就是本國貨以及外國貨亦相同。再就本國的食料品及原料品的批發價格，在停止後兩個月間，亦平均騰貴五％至一零％。加之，輸入原料品的價格騰貴率，亦與國產品無大差異。至零售價格未曾騰貴，這是因爲當時一般的工資和房租均如前，並未增加的緣故。</p>
<p>此外又因受金鎊低落的影響，其輸出品的價格也較前低落二零％。但是英國能否因金鎊和物價的低落，去奪回歐戰後所喪失的市塲，仍爲疑問。</p>
<p>在事實上，英國對外貿易總額，自停止金本位制後雖稍有進展，但爲數仍絶微少。輸入方面惟因季節的關係或增徵關稅而稍有增加，然而輸出額方面的增加，却絶微少。我們且看下表便可明瞭。</p>
<p>一九三一年英國禁止金輸出之貿易額</p>
<p>輸入　　　輸出　　　入超</p>
<p>八月　　六五·三　三三·零　三二·三</p>
<p>九月　　六八·三　三三·六　三四·七</p>
<p>十月　　八零·七　三八·一　四二·六</p>
<p>十一月　八三·二　三六·八　四六·四</p>
<p>但是在停止後兩個月間，失業者却因而减少了十五萬人。在此時期，本來照例失業者應該是不斷地增加，然而何以竟能因此而减少呢。那是因爲如上表所示，在此四個月間英國對外貿易，已由三千三百鎊增到三千六百八十萬鎊的緣故。由此我們得知道，失業者的减少範圍，决不是普遍於全體的產業部門，而僅屬於輸出工業部門而已。</p>
<p>至於關於解决金鎊問題，本來英政府所以突然停止金本位制和禁止金輸出，實出於不得已的臨時辦法；决不是永久的放任政策。如今，關於此問題之議論雖紛紛不同，然而其中最主要的意見共有三種。茲略將此三意見之内容述於下：</p>
<p>第一種意見是使金鎊價格低落，卽就是將普通金鎊的價格，務使其較前爲便宜；然而他方面對一般物價和工資，則如前並不增减。此說爲英國勞動黨最簡單的主要意見。如今，在英國經濟界贊成此說者大不乏其人。</p>
<p>第二種意見是欲由國際的協調，使金價能有伸縮性。其主張的要點是：當經濟界不景氣時，匯兌價格應該較普通時爲便宜才可，並藉此以刺激一般產業部門和輸出部門。至於其方法，則力求與世界各列强互相協調。猶其是希望能與占全世界黃金之過半的美國各準備銀行締結某種協定，以防止金價之暴騰。</p>
<p>此種意見雖極爲高妙而理想，然在最近幾年中實難進行。因美國或法國等黃金國，在此經濟恐慌普遍於全世界時，就自國的難題已解决了，怎能還有餘力來帮助英國呢。此種意見爲英國著名的經濟學者創斯（J.　M.　Keyens）的主張，贊成此說者甚多。</p>
<p>第三種意見是求金鎊時價和物價指數結合，並使兩者之變動均衡。其主唱者爲英蘭銀行經理普拉克特氏（Sir　B.　Blackelt）。因爲普氏一派向爲對「黃金專制」挑戰者聞名，而欲使貨幣的價值和物價的平均時價調和，藉以代替金本位貨幣而設定物價指數本位的貨幣，其目的不外在於安定物價而已。</p>
<p>在上述三種意見中，第三種意見頗有實力。不過，在將來金鎊决不是爲規定黃金的價值而存在；勢必然是將許多商品的平均價格，以金鎊的名來規定。</p>
<p>總而言之，上述三種意見的共同目標，皆站在使英帝國經濟區域内的物價能安定。換句話說，現在英國經濟界，自從停止金本位制以來，莫不爲解决金鎊問題而努力，而他們共同的結論，便是廢止金本位貨幣制而建立物價指數本位貨幣制；同時此種指數本位貨幣制便是英帝國唯一之出路。</p>

<p>▲改用洋本位…糾正轉期日期▲</p>
<p>此届掉期（十六日）起、金業交易所將有兩種改革、一爲實踐廢兩改元、已經明白公告、另一爲糾正在非規定日期、開始預做掉期、此事雖由經紀人提出尙未公决、今將情形記之於後、</p>
<p>（一）金交實行改用洋本位　金交昨發通告、略謂、奉監理員公函、遵守財政部通令、故自五月份交易起、所有標金市價、欵項出入、俱行改用銀幣計算、每條標金收經手費（佣金）銀幣二分一釐、除經紀人奬勵金外、實收銀幣一分五釐七毫半、所有三四月份交易、本以規元計者、俟此届轉期時遵章（七一五）合爲銀幣價格、此届掉期交易、卽應改用銀幣元角爲價格、其呌價以銀幣一角爲單位云、</p>
<p>（二）糾正轉期日期　經紀人方面、曾有此種提議、理由頗爲正當、蓋因所中向例於掉期時有預先一日就開始轉期之習慣、設或次日正式掛牌、相差過大時、客户時向責難、是以提議以後每逢掉期前一日下午二時起開始轉期賣買、並添掛轉期賣買行市、此案已經向經紀人公會提出、聞已通過、但將在下届起實行、（本月十六日因時間短促、手續不及辦妥）云、</p>
<h3 id="c219">證劵上週債市在駭浪中安全渡過 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>上週三月六日至十一日、華商證劵交易所、債劵經過、整個觀察、堪稱良好一週間時局之變化雖多、如熱河失守、天津危急、北張去職等等、而市價之經過、如舟行於驚濤駭浪中、竟安全渡過、陸地旁觀、則極爲膽戰心驚、其於惡劣之環境中、市價不依常規而背道上漲、其理由大槪不出下列四點、</p>
<p>（屬於戰事方面者）　熱河之得失、早在投機家意料之中、實已不關休戚、津局雖屬危急、仍屬日人聲東擊西、恐嚇舉動、且當局防備極嚴、短時間不致有何變動、散户投機、主觀錯誤、旣空必補、適足助債市之上漲、</p>
<p>（屬於成交方面者）　債市之漲跌、其最大原因、爲多空雙方之實力比較、其實力雄厚者、當然佔優勢、此時成交賬數、多頭多數屬於有力份子、空頭則散户居多、多頭始終不動、空頭以時局爲目標、初亦堅持、終則鬆懈、供易求艱、市價自不易跌落、</p>
<p>（屬於財政當局者）　財政當局之理財方法、一反從前濫發公債、竭　而漁之政策、二十一年份起、至今未增發在市流通之新公債、因此籌碼漸漸缺乏、藏現貨者、有鑑於九一八以後之跌、一二八以後之漲、敎訓已深、輕易不肯脫手、亦爲助漲增高之一因、</p>
<p>（屬於銀根方面者）　自關外戰　激烈、平津謠言謠起、北方現金、漸漸集中上海、銀貨過剩、投資困難、收買債劵以生息、比較積當而利厚、此種收集、數亦可觀、市面流通、漸見稀少、此種助漲勢力、亦有與焉、</p>
<p>總觀上列四點、在關内未有鉅大變動前、多頭壁壘森嚴、自不易搖動、故上週交易雖不多、六月間除週一及週四兩日、因熱河初失、北張求去、新空頭加入作戰、行市曾略見回小數角外、其餘四日、均在逐漸上漲中、尤以週二蔣委員長親自北上督戰、人心一振、驟漲一元半左右爲最鉅、全週結果、計漲起數角至一元數角不等、鹽稅一種、在四十元大關、幾次盤出盤進、結果仍在四千元外收盤、經過最爲良好、成交總數、計共四千六百七十三萬五千元、</p>

<p>— 樊仲雲</p>
<p>曾有人把我們中國人比之爲猶太人。</p>
<p>猶太人是一種有能耐的商業民族，中國的操奇計贏，我覺得也着實比猶太人有過之而無不及。</p>
<p>何以故呢？聽我道來。</p>
<p>猶太人是亡國之民，中國人名義上算還有個支離破碎的國家。</p>
<p>大家都說國是應當愛的，故雖如猶太人之亡國已二千年、仍孜孜不已的在努力於興國運動。我們的國旣没有亡，興國運動當然可以不必，我們現在是愛國運動。</p>
<p>愛國的方法自是多端：有的不抵抗，有的名義上抵抗而實則不抵抗，有的長期抵抗求諸在己，而有的則在「游藝救國」「跳舞救國」……總之這一切都是猶太人所不能有的。</p>
<p>猶太人之所不能有，便是我們中國人之所長。</p>
<p>商人們說：大减價是爲的救國。游藝場主人說，跳舞，電影，也是爲的救國。敎育家們的理由當然更爲充分，曰「讀書救國。」於是生意興隆，財源茂盛，學校商店，學生滿堂，社會呈「鎭靜」安定之象，而中國得救矣。</p>
<p>勇於内戰的軍人們說：即一兵一卒，也要抗戰到底，然而軍費到手，日兵未來，即扣車搬場至租界作寓公去了。</p>
<p>還有那些政治家說：一面抵抗，一面交涉。這是欲以抵抗的口號而與日本作買賣。熱河已旣給與日本，這樁買賣或者有成交的可能罷？</p>
<p>我從熱河陷落而公債漲價的消息、看到愛國買賣的成功。</p>
<p>中國人眞不愧是第二猶太人丨不，應該說猶太人是第二中國人。</p>

<p>— 子展</p>
<p>因爲一塲大病，從死神手裏逃出來，驚魂甫定，神智轉清，靜臥幾天，更多瞑想。不料思之思之，鬼神通之。讀書二十年讀不通，忽然靈機一動，豁然貫通了。啊呀，我纔知道正面文章是要反看的。例如你初到上海，你總會感覺到公共毛坑的缺乏，尤其是在法租界。倘若你是頭等阿木林，認眞相信「禁止小便，如違送捕」的告白，你雖看見那里尿流滿地，臭氣薰天，你也只有發尿急的。再如電車頭等車箱裏，每有「禁止吸烟」的華洋文告白，我却看見許多碧眼高鼻的外國人，口含雪茄，烟氣四散，令人氣悶頭痛，還有報紙上許多廣告是騙人的，那不在說，便是時事記較，至少也有十分之七八，須用我的「正面文章反看法」讀牠，你纔不會上當。比如說某地肅清，剿匪告一段落，其實所謂某地肅清也者，只是把匪由甲地趕到乙地罷了。肅清云乎哉？賀龍不止死一次、還是有一個賀龍。朱毛敗退老巢不止一次，他們還是不止佔一個老巢。他如大家都喊「航空救國」，其實没有看見一隻飛機敢還日本一個炸彈的。炸匪，炸沉自己的兵艦，却是眞的。「長期抵抗」等於長期不抵抗，「收回失地」等於「不收回失地」，你都要看牠反面的意義。總之我們讀書做事做人，都不可認眞一面，正面文章之外，須知有一個反面在。倘若你太認眞一面了，小之則蒙不慧之名，大之則有殺頭之禍。什麽打倒帝國主義，什麽打倒軍閥，以及打倒貪官污吏，打倒土豪劣紳之類，許多青年過於相信這類的宣言標語，自以爲革命，他們可寳貴的生命便輕輕送掉了的，倒還戴上反革命的罪名。有些聰明人僅僅把這些東西做幌子，小之則有事可做，不失温飽；大之則升官發財，安富尊榮。管什麽革命不革命，不過面子上不能不做正面文章。不懂「正面文章反看法」的人，讀書不通，做官不靈，發財不能，做人也不聰明。一法通，百法通，我願把這個獨得之秘貢獻大家，自我發明，並不專利。</p>

<p>— 蕭石君寄自巴黎</p>
<p>烈文旅歐時，嘗作「巴黎物語」在申報發表、頗受讀者歡迎。今烈文歸國，主編「自由談」，來函徵稿，因作「巴黎談屑」應之。「效顰」之謂，所不計矣。</p>
<p>（一）咖啡店與墓地</p>
<p>我們平常感到要了解一位朋友不是一樁容易的事。有人說要了解一個人，首先要對那人有情愫。如果你對那人漠不相關，或者意存鄙視，就令你和那人相處一百年，也决不會有了解的時候，我個人對於這個見解是極端贊同的。我覺得不僅對於朋友應當這樣。就對於另一個民族，另一個國家，也應當取這種態度。大槪因爲我住在法國有相當的日子了，一天一天愛着起來。尤其是對於這新奇古雅兩臻極致的巴黎我愛法國，是愛法國民族性有幾分和我們相似。特别是在她那近人情的地方。楊惲說「人情所不能止者聖人勿禁」「蘇老泉說」不近人情者鮮不爲大奸慝。」近年來有許多人批評孔子立說的長處就在平易近情。外國人恭維我們的時候也說我們近情知禮，不背中庸之道。如果說我們這個民族有長處，我個人狠相信我們祖先的長處全在透徹人情。這自然是說春秋戰國我們思想界的黃金時代。以後因爲政體專制，思想界便也漆黑一團，見不到一線光明。但我們現在憑藉書本去設想的那種盛况，我們儘可以在巴黎的咖啡店和墓地中耳聞目見。這並非笑談，凡游過巴黎的外國人大抵有同樣的認識。一眼望去巴黎的咖啡店比我國各市鎭上的茶館還要多，坐在裏面的人，不消說，以談天的佔大多數。可是他們有時談得狠到家，許多新的哲學新的文藝就是在咖啡店裏面談起頭的。例如英靈廟（Fantheon）前的一間咖啡店，是詩人魏爾倫（Verlaine）每日必到的地方。蒙巴拉斯（Montparnasse）的某咖啡店是畫家馬烈（Manet）等聚會之所。現在仍健存的比國戲劇家梅特林當年少游巴黎時，亦是在一間咖啡店遇到象徵派的先驅者瑋里耶。他們彼此狠相得，有時在咖啡店談到天光。我們如要調查大人物的逸事、咖啡店便是這類逸事的大寳庫。我看中巴黎的咖啡店還另有一點，卽是在那裏面可以看出法蘭西民族的性格。上面已經說過我最愛的是在她那近人情的地方。比方有幾個人走進咖啡店來，如談政治，無論左派，右派，共產黨，乃至王黨，如談繪畫，無論印象派，新印象派，後期印象派，野獸派，立體派，未來派，新浪漫派，新神秘派，象徵派，新古典派，韃韃派，表現派，超現實派，他們都可坐在一張桌子上辯論。有時他們自然免不了吵鬧，但决不致於吵鬧到不可收拾。至多請警察來彈壓一下就散了。散後依然互相尊重。他們極相信自己的主張，同時也尊重别人的主張。所以巴黎有極端的守舊派，也有極端的革新派。這種現象在胸襟狹小的人看來，似乎非常矛盾。但在敎養深厚的法國人眼中，絶不感到矛盾。他們有一個基本信念丨丨人决不是完美無缺的，各有各的長處，同時各有各的短處。旣不相信世間有什麽白璧無瑕的聖人，也不相信有什麽萬惡不赦的壞蛋。再舉一個例，我們在巴黎那四個華美莊嚴的墓地中，看見許多思想流派逈不相同的大人物，埋葬在一個地方。生前各人的思想儘管天南地北，死後却作貼緊的鄰居。這也可以看出人生的悲喜劇。巴黎有四大墓地，東西南北各占其一。東方墓地（Pere-Lachaise）中葬有莫里耶，拉豐迭努，貝朗哲（Beranger），謬塞，巴爾克扎，畫家柯洛，德拉柯洛阿，音樂家休班（Chopin），史家米西列（Michele　）等。西方墓地（Passy）中葬有近代音樂之父德毘奚（Clande　Debussy）和近代繪畫之父馬列。南方墓地（Montparnasse）中有波特萊爾的紀念像，聖伯甫，英泊桑，柯貝（Coppee）等的碑銘。北方墓地（Montmartre）中有左拉，小仲馬，雷南和畫家米列等的墓碣。而國人所熟知的紅顏薄命的茶花女，傳說實有其人，我們在這墓地中亦可找到她的埋香的標幟。總之，法國人不獨善於遣生，而且工於送死。巴黎的四大墓地裝點得十分雅潔，從咖啡店走到墓地，不由人不恭維他們死生兩得其所。</p>
<h3 id="c229">黑女求神記（二十六） <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— 蕭伯納作　宜閑譯</p>
<p>「價值旣然是比較的問題，她要不是認識了五十來個的男人，來同你比較比較，怎麽會知道你的價值呢？」黑女孩子說。</p>
<p>「哦，將男男女女造得這樣子的上帝呵！請你佑我，」亞拉伯人絶望似的嚷道。「我怎麽說呢？哦哦，有五十個父親的孩子豈不是没有父親。」</p>
<p>「只要牠有着母親，那就有什麽要緊？」黑女孩子說。「况且，你所說的話也是不對的。五十個裏的一個就是牠的父親了。」</p>
<p>「要曉得」，亞拉伯人說，「認識了不知多少男人的無恥的女人有着許多啦；可是她們没有養出兒女來，至於追求着佔有着凡有我眼睛所瞟到的中意的女人的我，是有着多多的子息的。由此說來，這一種對於女人的不公平顯然是上帝的神必之一了，要反抗上帝是不濟事的。上帝又偉大又光榮；惟他這里有着威嚴和權力；然而他的公平却没有給我們了解。我的嬌養慣了的妻子們生育子女的時候好不苦痛呵，我每聽得他們的呌聲，我的心就不由得抽緊了；這等苦痛，我們男子們是受不到的。這不是公平的事；你要救濟這樣的不公平，如果只有讓女人做男人的事，男人做女人的事這一個辦法罷，你覺得呌我可以坐在產褥上，生兒女麽？上帝不要這樣子啦。這是違反自然的。我只得這麽回答你了。」</p>
<p>「我知道我們不能違反自然」黑女孩子說。「你不能生兒女的；可是女人呢，儘可以有了幾個丈夫，還生兒女，只消她在同一時候，没有和一個以上的丈夫在一起。」</p>
<p>「上帝另外的種種不公平中間」，「那亞拉伯人說「有一種就是他所定的典章，說是最後的話得讓女人來說。我是不能說了。」</p>
<p>「逢到五十個女人聚集在一個男人周圍，每人都要說那最終的話時候，」造像的人說。「那怎麽樣呢？」</p>

<p>這是鐵一般的事實：暴日佔我東北，兵不血刃，并不是牠們的兵是「天神下降」，而是我們的「不抵抗主義」有以玉成之，暴日吃了這樣天大便宜的甜頭，不但不知足，還要得一覇二眼觀三地再張大其饕餮慾壑，奪我熱省，易如探囊取物，其原因固在熱湯之放棄職責，不戰而退。這樣局勢，顯然一方已經退處於内外交責，忍無可忍的地步了；而一方還得意忘形，得步進尺的節節進逼，所謂「困獸猶作負隅之鬥」，無怪乎我們的少帥，硬被激起雷霆之怒，「對熱河失守憤慨之餘，願調集所有東北軍基本隊伍，擔任正面作戰，自任前鋒，立下「軍令狀」，限日克復承德一（見十日新聞報九日本報晚報）乖乖！「善者不來，來者不善，」東洋人，還不趕快預備船隻東渡，結果必至於「吃不下」！</p>
<p>「軍令狀」之爲「軍令狀」，在這賞罰不明的年頭兒，也許有人忘其嚴重性了吧？譬如說：華容道義釋曹操的關公，孔明得下令把他「推出斬首」，爲的就是「軍令狀」！這回少帥所願立的「軍令狀」，雖尙莫測高深，但必「非同小可」，自不待言。揆其詞意，當然是在所限期内（自然勿要長期），誓必恢復承德；承德不復，誓不生還，亦即前所稱「要以血與命保衛國境」之意。假若將星高照，太陽星化解，敵彈不敢近身，不得已而生還，可是「軍中無戲言」，也應當拿出英雄本色，坦然甘受「推出斬首」，不，拖出槍斃之嚴重處分。這樣堂哉皇哉，足以使敵人駭汗而走的「軍令狀」，果然立自少帥之手，行至少帥之身，天地寗不爲之震怒，戰士寗不爲之飲血，昔范蠡不殉會稽之恥，曹沬不死三敗之辱，卒復勾踐之讐，報魯國之羞，可知我們的少帥，亦必以立此驚天動地之「軍令狀」誓復承德，以一洗瀋陽陷，錦州退，榆關失之奇恥大辱也無疑矣！然則吾人對此大有希望之「軍令狀」，敢不肅然舉手，掬誠致敬！</p>
<p>可惜蔣先生知道他的吹牛不去聽信，還是請其三十六只之一，深恐其非但承德不能收復，還要將平津送掉，只得多承厚意，敬謝不領了。</p>

<p>冬陽先前是滿不相信，以爲即或有之，也定是偶然。就是每日報紙上的吹擂是那麽厲害，阿福强姦根弟，阿大誘宿小毛，然一看「阿福性好漁色，而根弟年輕性蕩，致受誘惑，於是卿卿我我，雙飛雙宿，」也就可知其究竟了，但若事情破變了，責任却全在阿福身上丨丨阿福强姦根弟，其實當他們苟合的當兒，根弟也是滿心同意了的。</p>
<p>所以報紙上儘管多着這類的紀載，而冬陽却始終不置信心，以爲女人也總逃不了一部份責任。</p>
<p>所以他對他妻子的說話，自然也是十分懷疑，說那是全關乎女人的正經與不正經，這或是在妻子面前的原故，語氣更是格外重了，而妻子只說你是局外人，莫怪你不明瞭，將來總得使你親眼去看看。</p>
<p>這是第三次了。妻子拖着疲乏的身軀，不安定的靈魂，慌張地走回來，起初是啞口無言，繼之一陣哭，末後她對她的丈夫說：</p>
<p>「這晦氣的工，我眞不想去做了，那些王八蛋敢在我面前獻身手了，他媽……」她又哭了。</p>
<p>「怎麽一回事哪？你好好地說來吧！」冬陽安慰着問：</p>
<p>「你知道，得四嫂那臭貨，常是媚來眼去，毋性惹得那些混蛋，饞涎欲滴，結果在弄堂裏就……，事情爆發了，便老羞成怒起來，毋怪人人看她不起，毋怪你也曾說女人要負責任。」</p>
<p>「就是六小妹那貨，我也不是親眼看見她好幾次，一個姓彭的飯桶子向她搭訕，她也是推推就就的。至於我呀，從來就不打野眼，莫說理會那些東西，今天那姓王的猪羅，竟老是站在我的紡紗車旁，笑笑拉拉的做出種種的鬼相，我是不顧忌的向他開發：</p>
<p>「我做的不好是吧，你寫字條交賬房開除我吧！」</p>
<p>他反而撅起嘴笑迷迷的說：</p>
<p>「眞想不到你會這麽凶！乏了麽？今晚八點半我在ＸＸ路口等你，一同去看看電影不好麽！」</p>
<p>「我眞火冒透了，我便轉身就走，這媽的工我不做了！」</p>
<p>冬陽聽了，精神頓然抖擻起來·</p>
<p>「哈，那些王八竟這樣麽，哈，等我去！」他立刻站將起來，兩手撅擂着衣袖。</p>
<p>「那是最好了，我們一同去，那厮貨定是痴心的在ＸＸ路口等丨丨以爲我眞會入他的狗套的，去，我們一同去！」</p>
<p>妻子指出是站在電車月台旁紮着洋服手拿着夜報在看的漢子，冬陽便一股氣撲上前去，使勁把他摔在地上，隨着是拳打足踢，忽地冬陽的背上釘了兩拳，背脊酸溜溜地痛，無疑的是王飯桶的什麽保鑣來了。</p>
<p>正在困戰的時候，走來三四個巡警，不由分說的把冬陽夫婦抓進牢獄去了，而那姓王的飯桶却似奏着凱旋之歌，悠然的走開，巡警只是望望罷了。</p>
<p>「不做晦氣的工，便要坐這晦氣的牢，而且還連累了你，」是妻子的說話。</p>
<p>「是的，這就是現社會的究竟呵！不過王飯桶總算受了我們一頓飽敎訓！而今需要的是如何去敎訓這般狗的法警了。」是丈夫冬陽的說話。</p>

<p>正午的當兒，在Ｍ校門前，好像展覽會一般，甚麽都有：賣魷魚的，燒五香豆的，鷄蛋片的，豆腐干的，荸薺的，摸彩食物的，甚至連賣文具的和橡皮圈的。</p>
<p>天眞活潑的小孩子們，在未上課的時候，他們總是圍着這班賣食物的小販，有的買些食物大嚼其味道，有的正在興高彩烈的摸彩，没有錢的只好望着别人垂涎三尺，小孩子們毫不吝嗇地把錢從口袋内拿出來，也正是小販們生活的唯一保障。</p>
<p>「來了！大塊頭來了！」近馬路口一個賣五香豆的，一面這樣喊，一面很快的跑。這時熱閙的空氣突然緊張起來。</p>
<p>身體肥得像豬一般，穿着制服的巡捕從那邊追過來、小販們急得無命的逃跑·賣魷魚的躱在對面木堆下面，賣五香豆的蹲在垃圾桶旁邊，有的逃到别處去，一霎兒都逃光了。但巡捕一走過，校門前又恢復原狀。</p>
<p>「啊喲！大老爺，饒恕我罷！」巡捕又從那邊走來，小販們又第二次的逃跑，一個年紀五十多歲賣荸薺的老婆婆，因爲跑得太慢，給巡捕捉着，她百般的哀求，但毫不能感動巡捕的心，接着，一提籃削好雪白的荸薺都給巡捕推到地上滾　了。她只得蹲在地上收拾好含着淚的走開。</p>
<p>一個賣橡皮圈的孩子，大約十來歲光景，手裏拿着一串一串的橡皮圈，也是爲着躱得不靈敏給巡捕看見，首先吃了兩記耳光，隨着還埃一頓臭駡。</p>

<p>星期六下午、素來不上課的，是學生們休息或是遊玩的時期。</p>
<p>爲了中學裏課程較鬆的原故，今年敎育部明令各中學在星期六下午一律上課，并加添課程，因此學生們未免有些煩悶（？）的表示。</p>
<p>「眞討厭！今天下午本好賽球，却偏要上課。」</p>
<p>「三點鐘的電影又看不成了。」</p>
<p>「今天本和女友有約，但課務覊身，祗好改期了。」</p>
<p>「………………………………」</p>
<p>各種不同樣的怨言，在每個學生的口中發出，都是咒咀星期六下午上課，他們絶對没有想到星期六下午上課和誰有益！</p>
<p>事有凑巧，偏偏本級星期六下午的課程是大家認爲不注重的地理；功課旣不重要，先生又好說話，於是無故缺席也有，報到後假充小便而逃出敎室也有，他們自以爲勝利了，他們自管去做他所要做的事。一級中六十餘人，祗剩半數在敷衍場面。</p>
<p>「先生！請你重點一次名。」校長先生巡查敎室，因見人數太少，起了疑心而拿了點名簿來重行點名。</p>
<p>結果，無故缺席例外，臨課逃脫者共計八名。</p>

<p>店員通訊</p>
<h3 id="c294">忌歟丨惰歟丨 <a href="#c294" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e294" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">294</a></h3>
<p>— 沈烈文</p>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>貴報的店員通訊，是替我們店員工友學徒，解决疑難的：自開闢以來，我們得到了不少好處。現在我又有一件困難，仍舊請你指示我吧。事情是這樣的：在「一二八」以前，我在閘北×製漆公司執業，戰後當然失業了。我對於製漆事業，雖談不到學識上的資格，但十數年經騐所得，自問尙屬不差。在失業後約半年，經了許多波折，才在滬西某製漆廠裏，找到工作：非但生活問題，可以解决，而且以前的經騐，也有發揮的機會，正是喜不自禁呢。現在廠裏的出品，比了我以前執業的那爿廠裏的出品，次得多；但是原料是相同的，不過做法各異而已。我因爲「吃家井水和家人」的關係，熱心起來，勸技師改用我的方法，俾出品日漸精良，銷路日漸推廣，那知他老是不睬，不肯採用。我眞不知他還是「忍」呢還是惰呢！總之我的經騐，照這樣下去，是一輩子不能發揮了！先生你看怎樣辦呢？（下略）沈烈文謹上</p>
<p>×　　×　　×　　×</p>
<p>編者按：我國人有一種劣根性，就是「自己旣不肯上進，而徧徧不許人上進」：他的動機，不外兩種，即韓愈所謂「怠與忌之謂耳」。這種劣根性，一天不剷除，中國實在是一天没有希望。沈君那爿廠裏的技師，就是深中了這種毒的一個。我們以爲，沈君如其確有眞實經騐，和改良把握，你應當同經理商量，他一定會採取。因爲改良出品，對他直接有利。至於技師呢，他因爲怕一旦你成功了，他就要退下去。所以你要望他採用你的方法，實在是與虎謀皮，决没有希望的。</p>

<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（二）夢底開始</p>
<p>在上一段事實發生的四十三年之前，伍逸博士誕生於沿京滬線的一個小小的僻縣裏：那是Ｋ縣，以莫名其妙的「老先生」三個字聞名於天下的Ｋ縣。</p>
<p>其時，還没有什麽京滬路，也没有什麽小火輪，Ｋ縣和外界的交通，是無從想像的不便利；而安居在Ｋ縣的人們，也十九恭奉着「父母在，不遠游。」的古訓，輕易不肯把他們的身子，搬到離家十里以外的所在去。不過，在某一個時期裏，丨就是在大批「秀才舉人」下種的時期裏，每年兩次，照例總有一羣守寡一般地在書房裏守過十年，二十年，三十年，四十年的讀書朋友，抱着花團錦簇一般富麗的幻夢，别過了父母妻子，興怱怱地成羣結隊的踏上了十八世紀時代，中國内地所絶無僅有的交通利器　航船上去，望那些白鴿箱式的貢院的所在地進發。當然，在回來的時候，偶然也有幾個是雇着大號的官船，拉起了黃旗而回來的，那是幾修例外的，跳過龍門的鯉魚，大部份却還是搭着小航船回來的，</p>
<p>這一年的秋天，照常又有一班名利熏心的少年人，中年人，老年人，在準備着要背鄉離井的去做一場「打花會」式的迷夢了，駕航船的一羣赤脚漢，也忙着在大街上跑，老主顧固然不願犧牲，新主顧也急着要拉攏·</p>
<p>「二相公！你是不用說的，少不得要挑我們發些利市的了！」南大街上的伍府，是Ｋ縣裏有名的大家，多的是書香子弟：伍二相公也是其中佼佼者之一。雖然，他已曾三次不第而返，可是他年紀正輕，希望還大咧：所以，這一次，在駕船的老毛的心上，他少不得又有一位好主顧。</p>
<p>「這一次我不去！」伍二相公很沉鬱地給了他一個出乎意外的失望的答復。</p>
<p>「别胡說！老二！你不要錯過了自己的前程！」在老毛没有再向伍二相公拉攏之前，旁邊的伍大相公，已用長兄的地位，很嚴厲地駁回了他的話。</p>
<p>「對啦！這一次二相公保穩是中的，作準該去！」老毛得了伍大相公的帮助，便分外有力地慫恿着。</p>
<p>「不過，我……」伍二相公還想掙扎，這是對他老兄說的。</p>
<p>「長兄爲父，你能不聽我的話嗎？」伍大相公動氣了，决意强制執行。「老毛，替我們弟兄倆留下那個中艙來就是了！」</p>
<p>老兄說的話，老弟當然不能抝執，這是詩禮人家的規矩，伍二相公便屈服在這規矩之下了：不過當時他的態度，是格外的慌亂而憂鬱了，半响，儘在書房裏來來回回的踱着，後來，就抽空溜了出去，一直奔到了對面一家姓程的宅子裏。</p>
<p>姓程的以前也是一家富户，至今也還不窮，不過他們家裏的男人都早死完了，所剩的祇是一個四十多歲的寡婦，和一個十八歲的大小姐。伍二相公不知凑着怎樣的一次機會，竟和這位大小姐發生了戀愛，以致於使大小姐的肚皮，漲得和少奶奶一般的高了；但是，不幸得很，伍二相公府上，已另有一位明媒正娶的少奶奶，而伍大相公更絶對的不許他令弟再娶第二位夫人，因此便發生了極嚴重的問題·</p>
<p>可是程小姐的肚子，一天高似一天，愛情的結晶品，立刻就有出世的希望了；於是守寡的程太太，便以不正式的泰水的資格，勒令程二相公不准前去赴考。然而在另一方面，他哥哥以堅執着要强迫他去做一番顯親揚名的奮鬥；程二相公處於兩難之間，眞有些進退實爲狼狽了！</p>
<p>「這一次赴考回來，無論如何，我一定想法子把你娶回家去！寗可我跟老大分家，斷不會負你！」經過了一番内心的爭議之後，伍二相公的上進之心，戰勝了他的兒女之情，决意前去赴考。便用極誠懇的態度，向他的情人丨程小姐，徵求同意。</p>
<p>程小姐當然不能就答應他，後來他少不得又賭了幾句極毒的咒；丨說服女性的唯一方法丨而程小姐自己也有了一種新的覺悟，知道分娩這件事，就是伍二相公不走，也分不了她的痛苦的，因此她便允許了。</p>
<p>伍二相公離開Ｋ縣的第七天上，程小姐的肚子裏便鑽出了一個頭角崢嶸的麟兒來。程寡婦家裏，充滿着一種極神秘的喜氣。</p>
<p>…………………………………………</p>
<p>一個月，兩個月過了，…伍大相公赴考歸來，帶回一口靈柩，宣佈出伍二相公在闈裏染疾身亡的惡耗。</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The number of refugees from Rehe arriving in Tianjin has reached two thousand. They did not stay but went to relatives and friends in various places. According to the refugees, a Japanese man named Pu Yi-san came to Linxi in 1920 with over twenty Koreans to open a hospital. In 1922, he established the Mongolia Industry Company in Dalian. His main task was to induce Mongolians to be pro-Japanese and to investigate the Chinese military and political situation. Mr. Pu was required to send a telegram to the Kwantung Army headquarters every day. After the incident, he went to Liaoning. After our army inspected the hospital, they discovered many detailed drafts of maps of Rehe. The Yamato Trading Company in Chifeng sold weapons to bandits to create disturbances. The people of Rehe and Mongolia were foolish and greedy for Japanese money, secretly leaking information. After the Motegi Cavalry Brigade occupied Kailu, it went straight to Chifeng in eastern Suiyuan. The tanks were the latest models, capable of traveling 30 kilometers per hour. Motegi spent heavily to buy over Liu Guitang in Linxi, Lindong, Tianshan, and other places, which was very helpful. Sun Dianying resisted the Japanese most fiercely, constantly selecting several hundred daredevils to carry out raids. Only about one-third survived each time, but they inflicted heavy damage on the enemy and obtained many new weapons. At present, counterfeit money has poured into Rehe Province with the enemy's iron hooves, and white flour is also being sold at low prices. Matsui has been planning to establish a Mongolian state in Dalian for over twenty years, spending tens of millions of dollars. Recently, he appointed Prince De of Mongolia as an envoy. The Baling Prince still opposes the Japanese invasion. The people of northern Rehe have launched a volunteer army led by Hu Baoshan, vowing to resist the Japanese to the death.

<h3 id="e20">Japan's Intimidation Tactics <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese army, under the guise of a puppet state, is invading Rehe, waging war while still wearing a mask of peace. Our country entrusted its defense to the wrong person, leading to the enemy's increased arrogance. Recently, enemy cavalry has even approached the Great Wall, with the alarming intention of infiltrating North China. Meanwhile, the Japanese military has issued an unofficial statement, the main points of which are:</p>
<p>"First, China must cease its anti-Japanese activities and, at an appropriate time, begin direct negotiations."</p>
<p>"Second, all anti-Japanese efforts must be stopped, or Japan will take self-defense actions."</p>
<p>"Third, the area within the Great Wall should be designated as a neutral zone, and the Japanese army will remain north of the Great Wall."</p>
<p>We have heard these kinds of arguments since the Mukden Incident and before the fall of Jinzhou. They are extremely insulting to us. At the same time, they use the familiar language of "special interests" and "acquired rights" common to imperialism to anesthetize their own people and manipulate other countries. They trample on our country's territorial sovereignty with iron hooves without any regard.</p>
<p>With the three northeastern provinces already lost and Rehe falling into enemy hands, even though we desire peace, the enemy continues to advance relentlessly. Now, they are repeating the old trick of Jinzhou last year, forcibly seizing our land and oppressing our people. The issue of "peace" or "war" has extended from the northeast corner to Hebei. They are forcefully demanding a neutral zone, even extending it south of the Great Wall. In reality, they are continuously sending reinforcements, planning to seize our crucial passes along the border, threatening everything from Gubeikou to Shanhaiguan. Their intentions are clear.</p>
<p>In today's world, although national borders are strict, the distance between countries has shortened due to convenient transportation. Japan's relentless aggression against our country, in terms of international relations, has become increasingly rigid towards other countries since the League of Nations accepted the report of the Nineteen-Member Committee. Justice and righteousness are on our side, but violent plundering is intensifying. Therefore, Japanese imperialism, after failing to coerce the League of Nations through intimidation, now intends to withdraw from the League. It not only disregards the League's covenants but also intends to extend its iron hand and crush everything with its cavalry. If the United States of America had not experienced an unprecedented financial panic and the European countries were not fully focused on their own security, our country might have been able to survive under a new balance of power among the nations. But now that the balance of power in East Asia has been broken, our country cannot even勉强苟安. Japan sees that its adventurous policy is beneficial, so it is becoming increasingly outspoken and unrestrained. In the past, it still hung up the banner of peace and pretended to advocate for arms reduction. Now, it is engaging in naked aggression, expanding its armaments. Its military budget of 820 million yen this year is already a wartime budget. The sudden outbreak of the Rehe war will likely increase it to over 1 billion. Moreover, soldiers in their first year (without completed training) account for more than one-third of the troops in the Sixth, Eighth, and Fourth Cavalry Brigades and the Fourteenth Infantry Brigades. Therefore, Japan's military expansion does not need to wait for the complete failure of the disarmament conference. Its intimidation of the world and its acts of aggression against our country are sufficient and more than enough to prove this.</p>
<p>So, why does Japan pretend to be peaceful, declare that it will not invade North China, maintain the Yangtze River, and promote Sino-Japanese friendship? Japan is known as a militaristic nation, with a war every ten years as its national policy. However, it relies on overseas sources for 90% of the raw materials and iron ore necessary for war. Its foundation is clearly unstable. It wants to absorb our country's iron ore and other raw materials, and the huge market in the Yangtze River basin is an excellent area for Japan to sell its goods. Therefore, the Japanese hope to maintain their existing business relationships in our country along the Yangtze River and coastal areas and strive to develop them, thereby reducing their domestic economic panic. At the same time, this can also help to adjust the military expenses for its invasion of the Northeast and Rehe. What could be a more skillful plan?</p>
<p>Therefore, after gaining Rehe, it uses the pretext of establishing a neutral zone to缓和our country's "national spirit" and stabilize the foundation of its aggression. After some time, the enemy cavalry may appear in the neutral zone again and窥平津骚扰河北. Our countrymen must quickly recognize the enemy's intentions, never lightly believe its sweet words, and never be afraid of its threats.</p>

<p>Guo Taiqi and Matsuoka Broadcast Speeches in London</p>
<p>Lytton and Lloyd George Criticize British Policy</p>
<p>Japanese Privy Council Reviews Withdrawal from League of Nations Proposal</p>
<p>London Tonight, Japanese representative Matsuoka Yosuke and Chinese Minister to the UK Guo Taiqi will both use radio broadcasts to share their views on the Sino-Japanese conflict. Because the broadcast locations are different, the two did not meet. When Matsuoka arrived at the broadcast station, a group of communists took a hostile stance toward him, but the police prevented them from approaching. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>London Today, anyone with a radio listened to the broadcast speeches of Matsuoka, Japan's representative to Geneva, and Guo Taiqi, China's Minister to London. In his broadcast speech, Guo Taiqi strongly refuted the claim that Japan is a barrier to communism, stating that Japan's policy is to conquer the Asian continent, and that China is innocent. The Lytton Report and the League of Nations General Assembly have both stated this. Guo outlined China's progress since 1926, stating that China is not only not anti-foreign, but also prepared to cooperate internationally with Europe and America. As for Japan, it is a country of disruption, with anti-foreign sentiment permeating the entire country, especially in the last two years. For the sake of British and European interests, Japanese aggression must be stopped. If members of the League of Nations uphold the League's covenants, they can stop the aggression, and the aggression will stop itself. The Chinese people hope that Britain will set an example for the world by first refusing to provide the Japanese militarists with the materials they need for war. Britain only needs to make a moral claim, refusing diplomatic, financial, and commercial assistance to the aggressor, and it can eliminate today's war in the Far East and perhaps eliminate all future wars, he said. Matsuoka said that Manchuria is the cornerstone of the Far Eastern problem, so Japan cannot allow people who hate Japan to manage it. This is not only a matter of life and death for Japan, but also a matter of avoiding division and chaos in the Far East. Japan's inability to raise the Manchurian question in the League of Nations is like Britain's inability to raise the Shanghai case in 1927. Manchuria's development is due to Japan's initiation and its undertakings. The League of Nations did not seriously oppose Japanese troops assisting the Manchurian state in suppressing illegal elements in North and South Manchuria, so he does not understand why the League of Nations opposes Japan performing the same work in Rehe, because Rehe is part of Manchuria. Facts are gradually proving the soundness of Japan's actions in Manchuria. The Manchurian state is now on its way to achieving its wishes. Japan's only goal is to restore peace in East Asia and maintain it. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Tokyo Prime Minister Saito and Foreign Minister Uchida entered the palace yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM to meet with the Emperor regarding the procedures for withdrawing from the League of Nations, requesting consultation with the Privy Council. The consultation proposal will be submitted to the Privy Council soon. The Privy Council will begin preliminary review by two secretaries. On the 13th, the director of the Legislation Bureau and Foreign Vice Minister Arita will be invited to the Privy Council office to explain the bill and　　　、　listen to the Privy Council's explanation. The preliminary review can be completed in three or four days. During this time, a chief examiner and eight members will be appointed to the examination committee. After the preliminary review, the examination committee will be opened, which will take about two weeks to complete. It is expected to be submitted to the Privy Council's main conference for approval and passage, so the formal notice of withdrawal will be around the end of the month.

<p>London Lord Lytton, chairman of the League of Nations' Manchuria Inquiry Commission, today defended the British government's decision to ban the shipment of arms to China and Japan, saying that one of the two countries has been recognized as violating the League of Nations Covenant, so the British government cannot allow arms to be shipped to that country. As for the other country, a compromise should be reached internationally to grant it special treatment before arms can be allowed to be shipped to that country. If this compromise cannot be achieved, then the order prohibiting arms exports should be canceled for both countries at the same time. (Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>London Liberal Party leader Lloyd George launched a fierce attack on the current government's foreign policy, saying that the British government has adopted a unilateral policy on the issue of disarmament and prevented Germany from exercising its right to equal armaments, with the result that Germany has had to take risks. This is why the threatening German military dictatorship has been able to establish itself. As for the Far East, the policy adopted by Britain between China and Japan is hesitant and indecisive, allowing Japan to disregard the League of Nations. The damage to the League's prestige is most serious in this regard. (Havas Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>London Matsuoka arrived in London tonight and told a Reuters reporter that he had completed his diplomatic mission except for reporting to the Emperor and the Japanese government. His travels to various European capitals had no diplomatic effect. His trip to the Netherlands was purely a private trip because he wanted to know about the Dutch oil industry and investigate the results of extracting oil from coal. It is said that someone suggested to Matsuoka that the Japanese oil industry should exchange information with the Dutch oil industry in order to continue research. Matsuoka also told Reuters reporters that the major powers with interests in the Far East should seek ways to fill the gap created by the termination of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty. Most of the current difficulties in the Far East stem from this. Speaking in a private capacity, he greatly regretted the United States' decision to assemble its fleet in the Pacific, as this move would increase Japan's resentment towards the United States. But he believes that even in the current chaotic state of the world, US-Japan relations can be placed on a solid foundation. Matsuoka is scheduled to leave for New York on March 17.

<p>Tension Suddenly Increases on German-Polish Border, Politicians Flock to Geneva</p>
<p>▲Reuters Berlin, 11th The German press reports very active movements near the Polish border. General Schleicher's newspaper says about 300 military aircraft have assembled at a military airfield near the Polish border, and the number of tanks at a certain location has increased from 35 to 85.</p>
<p>▲Reuters Geneva, 11th Dr. Ziem, President of the Senate of Danzig, has arrived here due to a dispute with Poland over Westerplatte. According to Dr. Ziem, a team of about 200 Polish soldiers has landed there, carrying machine guns and flying torpedoes, which is contrary to Danzig's sovereignty and international treaties. This is a spark that could start a prairie fire. The High Commissioner of the League of Nations stationed in Danzig does not recognize Poland's right to increase its troops and has asked Poland to withdraw them, but Poland has refused. The Council of the League of Nations has approved Poland stationing 88 troops at Westerplatte, but Poland has recently increased the number of troops there, claiming that undesirable elements have recently gathered there, fearing that they will destroy its gunpowder depot, so it must increase troops to protect it.</p>
<p>▲National Geneva, 11th The League of Nations Council has postponed further discussion of the dispute between Danzig and Poland until Monday. This matter has now caused concern on all sides, who say that if the League of Nations cannot find a way to stop Poland's high-handed actions, the future events will be unpredictable. Today, Danzig Senate President Ziem gave a speech, saying that the machine guns and cannons that Poland is now aiming at the free city of Danzig could be fired at any time, causing a new war between nations.</p>

<p>▲Reuters London, 11th In the coming weeks, European politicians will gather in Geneva for secret meetings, not only to discuss ways to save the disarmament conference, but also to address the political situation in Europe. France is now concerned about the affairs of the Strasbourg district. Yesterday, some members of the National Socialist stormtroopers broke into an undefended area and occupied the Strasbourg city hall and the barracks on the Rhine River. The German authorities later made an explanation for this matter, but whether the French government is satisfied is still uncertain. Public opinion believes that the Strasbourg incident is detrimental to the hope for the future of the disarmament conference. It is said that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini now intends to go to Geneva to support British Prime Minister MacDonald, because the Fascist Party is quite uneasy about German Chancellor Hitler's dispatch of administrative commissioners to subdue the governments of Bavaria and Saxony, and his authority is growing. In addition, because the situation in Danzig is uncertain, Poland has sent troops to gather in Gdynia, and Germany has now asked the League of Nations to stop it, so there are many things that the politicians in Geneva should do in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e39">MacDonald Says Situation is Chaotic <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>▲Havas Geneva, 11th After arriving here, British Prime Minister MacDonald declared to the Belgian representative to the disarmament conference, Paul Hymans, that the purpose of this trip was not to propose new plans or suggest new methods, but because the European situation was extremely chaotic, which could cause the disarmament conference to fail, he intended to find a way to avoid it. Hymans believes that the most difficult thing for the disarmament conference is the dispute between France and Germany over the abolition or reduction of the German National Defense Force, which has made any possibility of compromise disappear. MacDonald did not have much hope for the results of future negotiations and stated that the British government would never force France to make any concessions that would endanger France's security. MacDonald and Hymans also discussed the ban on arms shipments to the Far East. MacDonald also met with representatives from other countries and asked them for their opinions on how to break the deadlock in the disarmament conference, and asked the representative of a certain country, "If you were a dictator, what would you do?" The opinions of the representatives of the various countries were divided, and they were hesitant, but they all seemed to be sincere. MacDonald will meet with representatives of several countries on Monday, including Polish Foreign Minister Beck. After consulting the opinions of all parties, the British Prime Minister will definitely take action. There are many rumors about how to break the disarmament deadlock, but they are all fabrications.</p>

<p>▲Reuters Geneva, 11th British Prime Minister MacDonald has been very busy since arriving here, meeting with Czech representative Benes, disarmament conference chairman Henderson, Italian representative Aloisi, US representative Wilson, and Greek representative Politis. It is said that MacDonald discussed the situation in the Far East, the disarmament issue, and the arms embargo on the Far East with the representatives. People here generally take a pessimistic view of the future of the disarmament conference. The disarmament conference has now reached the stage of complete rupture. Without courageous remedial measures, its collapse will be unavoidable.</p>
<p>▲Havas Geneva, 11th After arriving here, French Foreign Minister Bonnet met successively with Czech Foreign Minister Beneš and Polish Foreign Minister Beck, representatives of the Little Entente.</p>
<p>▲Havas Budapest, 11th Hungarian Foreign Minister Kanya has set off for Geneva to meet with politicians from various countries. The fate of the disarmament conference will be decided in the near future, so the Hungarian Foreign Minister especially wants to attend in person. Kanya will also go to Rome to visit Italian Prime Minister Mussolini.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Resumption of Disarmament Talks Between Britain and Germany <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Geneva, 11th (Dispatch) Today is the first day after the resumption of the Disarmament Conference. Various parties are discussing how to salvage it. Tonight, British Prime Minister MacDonald held crucial talks with German representative Nadolny. It is expected that Britain and Germany will continue to negotiate various important issues on Sunday and Monday. Before Prime Minister MacDonald met with the German representative, MacDonald and Simon had first met with the Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, Henderson, the Vice-Chairman Politis, and representatives from Italy, Czechoslovakia, and other countries. Representatives from Italy, Czechoslovakia, and other countries also visited French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour and Polish Foreign Minister Beck afterward. However, these talks only made the situation more chaotic. Although British Prime Minister MacDonald still holds onto the illusion of salvaging the situation, the hope for the future is practically zero. This is because even after the Paris talks between Britain and France, they have not been able to find a concrete method for disarmament, but rather a somewhat ambiguous approach to avoid discussing Germany's demand for equality in armaments.</p>
<p>▲Geneva, 12th (Havas Dispatch) Reports indicate that the solution to the Disarmament Conference is for Britain, France, and the United States to formulate a practical plan and then submit it to representatives from Italy and Germany for their participation. British Prime Minister MacDonald informally notified German representative Nadolny that he wished to meet with him and scheduled a meeting for 6 p.m. After meeting with Nadolny, MacDonald is expected to meet with League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond.</p>
<p>▲Essen, 11th (Dispatch) Aviation Minister Göring, speaking at the opening ceremony of the German Aviation Exhibition here today, stated that the discussion of the internationalization of commercial aviation at the Disarmament Conference is nothing but a trick to deliver a fatal blow to our gradually recovering commercial and aviation industries after the war. This attempt will surely fail. He has refused to go to Geneva to participate in the conference. If he were to address the Disarmament Conference, his words would be final. Göring also recalled the brave deeds of German pilots during the war, who often won against overwhelming odds, which the Germans should maintain. However, Germany must now strive to break free from its shackles before it can gain due respect. The establishment of a dedicated aviation department by Germany is sufficient to indicate its determination to achieve this goal.</p>

<p>Warsaw, 11th (Havas Dispatch) The port of Westerplatte near the Free City of Danzig stores Polish military supplies. Last Sunday, the Polish government received a report that members of the National Socialist Party planned to stage an uprising there, and immediately dispatched troops to garrison the area. Today, the local daily newspaper published detailed information about the uprising plot, including details previously unknown. According to reports, terrorist elements of the National Socialist Party in the area planned to launch an uprising on the evening of the 9th of this month. However, they first intended to remove the port police, which was decided by the Danzig Free City Council on February 15th to replace the port police with the Danzig city police. This has already been done. Fortunately, the plot was discovered early, and no incident occurred. The newspaper concluded that on the same day, the barracks in Kehl in the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland in Germany were also occupied by National Socialist Party soldiers, suggesting that this incident was related to the conspiracy.</p>
<h3 id="e43">The Polish Corridor: A Point of Contention Between Germany and Poland <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Recently, Germany's attacks on the Polish Corridor Province have intensified. The so-called Corridor Province is the eight coastal districts between East Prussia and Germany. In 1919, it was unanimously decided by the Allied Powers after the European War to return it to Poland. Germany considers this an unfair handling of the Treaty of Versailles and vehemently opposes it. The truth of this matter is described below. After the establishment of the Treaty of Versailles, German ultranationalists strongly advocated making the acquisition of the Polish Corridor Province the core of their foreign policy, promoting it with all their might. The reasons for their dispute are nothing more than that the establishment of the Corridor Province is the most unfair measure against Germany, as the area formerly belonged to Germany and must eventually belong to Germany again. Secondly, the separation of East Prussia from Germany by the Corridor Province is unbearable. Thirdly, the majority of the residents in the Corridor Province are Germans. However, based on the facts: (A) Historically, the term "Pommern," which refers to today's Corridor Province, is a German term derived from the Polish word "Po-Morze." The names of the districts and rivers within the area are mostly similar. "Po-Morze" means "coastal area." German historians have stated that "Danzig" is a name derived from the ancient Polish word "Gdansk," which is a Slavic name and undoubtedly not of German origin. In the early 11th century, Polish King Bolesław unified the Polish territory, including all the areas known today as the "Corridor Province." In 1148, Pope Eugene III restored Danzig to the Polish diocese. In 1308, Teutonic Knights, at the invitation of the Polish King, came to preach in the remote area of Prussia. However, they betrayed their promise and occupied the land of the Corridor Province. In 1454, Poland finally recovered the lost territory. During the first partition of Poland in 1772, the Corridor Province was ceded to Prussia, while Danzig was annexed by Prussia during the second partition in 1793. Poland occupied the Corridor Province for about 700 years. It was not until the Treaty of Versailles in 1920 that the Corridor Province (excluding Danzig) was returned to its original owner, Poland, while Germany occupied the remaining provinces for nearly 148 years. (B) Ethnically, the majority of residents in each district of the Corridor Province are Polish people. Recently, the new German Chancellor Hitler stated that "the majority of residents in the Corridor Province are Germans," which is a mistake. During German rule, every representative participating in the parliament was Polish. In 1921, German residents accounted for only 19% of the province's population, and now it is even less than that. In 1927, German parliamentary speaker Laub declared, "We are fighting for the Corridor Province in our country (Germany), but everyone admits that the population of the province is Polish." (C) Economically, if we examine it from an economic perspective, the relationship between East Prussia and Germany has not been hindered at all. Since 1921, Poland has strived to adhere to a policy of transportation convenience. The German authorities are deeply satisfied with the speed and efficiency of the railway administration. Moreover, the Corridor Province is Poland's only access to the sea, and the lifeblood of the entire country is tied to this province.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Hitler's Speech After Election Victory Transforms Germany's Destiny Amidst Ten Thousand Cheering Listeners, Efforts to Eliminate Treaty Shackles <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>▲Berlin, 11th (Dispatch) Prussia will hold provincial and municipal elections on Sunday. Tonight, Chancellor Hitler delivered a speech in the exhibition hall, attended by ten thousand people, with thunderous cheers. Hitler first praised President Hindenburg, then expressed his joy over the victory in last Sunday's general election, stating that Germany's destiny has been transformed and hoping that everything will go smoothly from now on, leading to true prosperity. Hitler also stated that the movement against Marxism is not out of hatred for laborers, but to save them from evil forces and prevent the complete collapse of the country. He stated that he does not harbor vengeful thoughts towards those who have hated us for fourteen years or foreign enemies. He is actually against war and is well aware of its horrors. Because he wants to achieve understanding, he is determined to restore Germany to a condition and position that makes it worthwhile for other countries to achieve understanding with us. National unity must be placed before international unity. He believes that this can be achieved. Interior Minister Frick, speaking in Frankfurt, stated that this revolution is not solely against Marxism. Any disturbances must be caused by foreigners impersonating members of the National Socialist Party to harm our movement. This has already been confirmed. Göring also spoke before demonstrators in Essen, stating that he intends to submit a proposal to the parliament to purify the officialdom, allowing corrupt officials to be dismissed at any time without receiving pensions. In special cases, they may be ordered to return improperly obtained funds. The process of purification has only just begun and cannot be completed immediately. Göring also mentioned the temporary closure of Jewish shops, stating that shouldn't the Germans tell the public not to shop at Jewish stores but at German stores? He believes that this is a matter of course. If he encounters anything that harms the Germans, he will use the police regardless of who is involved. However, he cannot protect Jewish shopkeepers with the police.</p>
<p>▲Hamburg, 11th (Dispatch) The Hamburg and Bremen East Asia Associations held their annual banquet here today, attended by over two hundred people. Chairman Illies stated that the interests of overseas compatriots should be considered, and he requested that the new government not forget overseas compatriots when reorganizing domestic affairs. He also stated that the expenses of embassies and consulates should not be reduced so that representatives abroad can effectively represent the country. Hamburg's new mayor, National Socialist Party member Krogmann, stated that he firmly believes that Chancellor Hitler will pay attention to overseas compatriots and ensure that they receive proper support. He also emphasized that domestic conditions should be actively promoted abroad so that German expatriates understand the necessity of the government's actions. Foreign Minister Neurath was unable to attend the banquet due to important official duties and was represented by Director Meier of the Oriental Department, who read Neurath's speech, which was extremely powerful. The audience applauded repeatedly. He stated that shortsighted politicians had attempted to shackle 60 million people for generations with the so-called Treaty of Versailles, not realizing that they could not treat a nation that had not completely lost its honor and self-respect in this way. Today, the German nation is happy to begin restoring its self-respect and abandoning the shame of the post-war era. We are forced to fight against treaties that are unnatural and unfair. Countries that are satisfied with the status quo often oppose attempts to change the status quo, so Germany's diplomatic position is quite difficult. It is often forced to make demands to maintain its unfair claims. At this time, some foreign countries still want to create a united anti-German front. It cannot be denied that peaceful methods are often difficult to change an unbalanced and unstable world. However, we have unwavering faith in the ability of the German nation to strive and achieve, which has given us the courage to undertake this arduous task. In short, there are only two paths in the world. If the Germans are not allowed to proceed along a fair and free path and become the guarantor of peace in the heart of Europe, then Europe will be close to an abyss.</p>
<p>▲Berlin, 12th (Havas Dispatch) Chancellor Hitler used radio broadcasts to announce the President's order, stating that from tomorrow until the national flag issue is finally resolved, all government offices should uniformly fly the National Socialist Party swastika flag and the former imperial national flag. Hitler also declared that the first phase of the revolution has now ended, and it is necessary to maintain absolute internal discipline.</p>
<p>▲Berlin, 12th (Havas Dispatch) The anti-Jewish movement has again caused disturbances in the town of Döbeln. Some troublemakers mingled among the shopkeepers and employees of Jewish shops, destroying the goods on display. By the time the police arrived, most of the rioters had already fled. Armed police have restored order. Fortunately, Jewish shops in Reichenbach were completely closed. In the state of Saxony, uniformed members of the National Socialist Party stood in front of Jewish shops, advising the public to shop only in German shops. In Leipzig, rioters demonstrated in front of Jewish shops, smashing glass cabinets. The government of Mecklenburg expelled a Jewish merchant who had not obtained German citizenship and was suspected of harboring Communist Party members.</p>

<p>丨Inscriptions on Jade Slips Excavated Beneath Mount Tai丨</p>
<p>Taian Correspondence: Jade artifacts and silk slips used by Tang Emperor Xuanzong during the Fengshan ceremony at Mount Tai were discovered at the site of the Haoli Mountain Pagoda beneath Mount Tai, as previously reported. It is now known that someone who participated in the excavation secretly rubbed a piece of the Fengshan Mount Tai text inscribed on the jade slip. The original text is entirely in the clerical script. It is transcribed below for those interested in the study of cultural relics. The text reads, "In the thirteenth year of Kaiyuan, in the year of Yichou, on the eleventh day of the eleventh month, Xinmao, the successor son, Minister Longji, dares to declare to the Emperor. The minister inherits and guards the great name, and is entrusted with this great destiny. He follows the earth's righteousness and serves as the extreme of humanity. He is respectful day and night and has not dared to be at ease. Relying on the blessings of Kunyuan, he has been granted auspicious omens, which have nourished all things and repeatedly ensured abundant harvests. He dares to make a tour of the times to repay the merits of the great earth, and dares to prepare jade, silk, sacrificial offerings, and all kinds of sacrifices for this burial ceremony to express his utmost sincerity. Emperor Ruizong Dashengzhen, who is paired with the gods as the master, may he enjoy."</p>
<p>Note: Kaiyuan was the reign title of Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang Dynasty, which was 1199 years before the founding of the Republic of China. Longji was Xuanzong's name. The above text seems to be a text for offering sacrifices to the Earth Emperor. It is suspected that there is also a text for offering sacrifices to the Heavenly Emperor. (March 10th)</p>

<p>The Banking Crisis Has Passed</p>
<h3 id="e47">Roosevelt Announces that American Banks Will Reopen Today <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Sound Banks Will Be Fully Open by Wednesday</p>
<p>Federal Reserve Banks Supply Currency to All Banks</p>
<p>▲Washington, 11th (Dispatch) U.S. President Roosevelt announced today that national banks will gradually reopen starting Monday. It is hoped that solid banks will be fully operational by Wednesday. Licenses are scheduled to be issued on Monday to all solid banks under the Federal Reserve System. Licenses will be issued on Tuesday to sound banks in various cities that have joined formal clearinghouses. On Wednesday, licenses will be issued to all other banks that can prove their foundation is solid. The second category can actually include all important banks that do not join the Federal Reserve System, as there are currently 250 cities and towns in the United States that have organized clearinghouses. Today, the twelve Federal Reserve Banks have, in accordance with the order of Treasury Secretary Woodin, sent currency to various banks so that they can operate their full business after opening. Only transactions in gold, both domestic and foreign, are prohibited.</p>
<p>▲Washington, 11th (Dispatch) Tonight, Treasury Secretary Woodin issued a further order, slightly altering the regulations for the bank reopening period. Only member banks of the Federal Reserve System and Federal Reserve Banks located in the same city can reopen on Monday. As for other member banks located in other cities, they and the member banks of clearinghouses will open on the next day. The reason is that the Federal Reserve Banks will not be able to send currency to banks in other cities before Monday. Therefore, only banks in twelve cities, including New York, Chicago, Cleveland, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Boston, Kansas City, Atlanta, Richmond, St. Louis, Dallas, and Minneapolis, will open on Monday.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Government Handling <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>President Roosevelt, who at this time holds nationwide financial dictatorial powers, has announced that he will broadcast a summary of the events of the past few days to the entire nation over the radio at 10 p.m. on Sunday night so that everyone can have a clear understanding. He also stated that the technical difficulties in all banking plans have been eliminated, and various banks will start to reopen starting Monday. At the same time, the Treasury Department reported that the return of privately hoarded money to banks is continuing to increase sharply. As of tonight, it has reached 1 billion yuan, which is approximately equal to the amount withdrawn in the two days before the President's proclamation amending the bank holiday. The Treasury Department is confident that the banking industry will proceed smoothly from now on, so it has announced the government's spring debt exchange plan, which will begin on Monday with the submission of 800 million yuan in Treasury bonds for bank subscription to repay maturing debts. It is expected that this money will be raised quickly, or that the amount of subscriptions will even exceed the amount of issuance.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Bank Preparations <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>At this time, national banks are actively surveying and settling accounts in the hope of demonstrating their full ability to pay so that they can reopen. It is said that the vast majority can meet this qualification. It is expected that after the banks open, there will be sufficient solid institutions in various places to handle all financial matters. It is reported that various banks in San Francisco have reported to the Treasury Department that they can comply with the most stringent regulations set by the government. Other major cities have also made similar reports. Banks in Hawaii, Texas, and Kansas have announced that they are ready to open on Monday. Eastern banks have also demonstrated that their foundations are solid and that they are prepared to reopen quickly. The Treasury Department has now notified various banks that they may also accept checks issued before March 6, but only for transfer, not for cash payments. The Treasury Department is determined not to allow currency to fall into the hands of those making runs on banks. It was recently heard that the government has decided to divide the banks into three categories and reopen them on different days purely for convenience because various banks must have huge amounts of currency before they can open, but transportation takes time.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Securities Trading <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>New York, 11th (Dispatch) The board of directors of the New York Stock Exchange decided today that it will still not open next Monday. According to sources in the exchange, it will probably open on Wednesday because it is of little value for the exchange to open when banks in other cities have not fully resumed operations. As for the offices of various brokers, various order forms continue to be sent in an endless stream because it is expected that securities will rise in price after the opening.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Budget Cuts Passed <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Washington, 11th (Dispatch) At this time, although the President and the Treasury Secretary have made solid progress in handling the banking crisis, they have encountered difficulties in Congress because a majority of Democratic congressmen opposed the President's proposed free reduction of veterans' pensions, disobeying party orders and not adhering to the constraints of the party conference. The President plans to reduce the pensions of non-disabled veterans by half, while those who generally support veterans' interests are trying to revive and pass the Blandoning Amendment, which would limit the reduction to no more than one-quarter. Finally, after appeals from House Speaker Rayburn and various Democratic leaders, the Republican faction supporting the budget cuts supported the proposal, and the entire budget cut proposal was passed according to the government's original proposal by a vote of 266 to 138. Dissecting the opponents, there were 91 Democrats, 42 Republicans, and 5 Farmer-Labor Party members. After the proposal was passed in the House, it was immediately transferred to the Senate. The Senate Finance Committee then convened immediately and passed the original proposal. It is now expected that the Senate will vote on Monday. After the House passed the proposal, the Senate adjourned to express condolences because Republican Senator Howell passed away from lung disease here this afternoon. Howell was sixty-eight years old and had always advocated for the public ownership of public utilities.</p>
<h3 id="e52">The Second and Third Internationals Join Hands <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>(Basel, 11th (Dispatch)) According to Moscow sources, the Soviet Communist Party's Third International is seeking to contact the Socialist Second International to make a joint struggle because of the German government's anti-communist policies. The Swiss Communist Party has formally requested the Socialist Party to make a joint demonstration. It is reported that the Socialist Party has agreed. According to London sources, the British Communist Party has also made a similar application to the Labour Party, but it has been rejected by the Labour Party.</p>
<p>(Berlin, 11th (Dispatch)) The police authorities heard that a Hungarian communist leader who has lived in Russia for a long time and one German leader have secretly arrived here, hoping to incite unrest. Today, the images of the two men have been disseminated everywhere.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Recent Soviet Foreign Policy (Authored by Molotov) <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Furthermore, the termination of the 1930 Anglo-Soviet trade agreement also warrants discussion. This agreement was terminated by the British government, and its true purpose remains unknown. However, speculating, if the intention was to intimidate the Soviet Union by severing the trade agreement, that would be rash, as the Soviet Union is not afraid. And if the intention was to inflict some kind of loss on the Soviet Union, that would be even more miscalculated. Anyone who needs to order from the Soviet Union understands this. We are well aware that countries with regular diplomatic and trade relations with the Soviet Union benefit more than others. In particular, unlike some capitalist countries, the Soviet Union always fully fulfills its obligations on time and never breaches contracts or defaults on debts.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, one cannot help but mention the basic mission of Soviet foreign policy: to implement a policy of peace. The Soviet Union pays close attention to issues related to guaranteeing general peace or related to a second world war. The Soviet Union's proposal for a general and genuine disarmament plan in February of last year was simply an expression of this intention.</p>
<p>The Soviet government's proposal to many countries to conclude non-aggression treaties is also a manifestation of its struggle for the peace policy it upholds. In the past year alone, the Soviet Union has made great progress in concluding non-aggression pacts. The signing and ratification of non-aggression treaties by the governments of Poland, Finland, Estonia, and Lithuania is a great victory for Soviet diplomacy. These non-aggression treaties are of great significance for consolidating the cause of peace. The Soviet Union and France have also signed a non-aggression treaty, but this matter is still unfinished because France has not yet ratified the treaty. (Translator's note: The Franco-Soviet treaty has already been ratified.)</p>
<p>However, the Soviet Union's relationship with Romania is slightly different. Romania has refused to sign a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union. Therefore, in the West, only one country bordering the Soviet Union has refused to sign a non-aggression pact. There is no need to examine this issue in detail; it is only necessary to point out that Romania's refusal to conclude a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union is not due to any opinion of the Romanian government itself on this issue, but rather to external reasons. It is extremely wrong for political dictionaries to include such countries, which in fact have no independent foreign policy but are subordinate to the foreign policy of another strong country, among so-called "independent" countries. In any case, the victims of this are only Romania and its government. Now, let us turn to the Far East issue.</p>
<p>The League of Nations' handling of the Far East issue is well known throughout the world. It has been more than a year since the League of Nations accepted the Manchurian Incident. There have been several resolutions on this issue. The League of Nations has also discussed the situation in China and Manchuria many times and has sent a special investigation committee to investigate the area. The committee's report has also been published for a long time and has returned to Europe to report. The League of Nations has established an extra committee on this issue, and then another committee. Its resolutions are also the most comprehensive possible. However, there has been no progress whatsoever. Only one thing has progressed very quickly, and that is the League of Nations' credibility in the eyes of the world, which has been increasingly discredited.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union has never linked its hopes with the League of Nations and its committees, but the issue of international relations in the Far East is extremely important to the Soviet Union. Therefore, it has had to take many measures.</p>
<p>Considering the complicated environment in the Far East, the Soviet government proposed to Japan a year ago to conclude a non-aggression treaty. In the current international environment, the political significance of this move is very obvious and need not be elaborated. However, the Japanese government soon notified the Soviet government that the time was not yet ripe for the conclusion of this agreement. There is no need to analyze in detail the reasons for the Japanese government's rejection of the Soviet government's proposal to conclude a non-aggression pact. We know that this rejection is indeed temporary, but we must also consider the facts.</p>
<p>The Soviet government strictly adheres to a policy of neutrality in the Far East, and it still firmly adheres to this position and will continue to implement this policy to the end. However, the attitude of a few Japanese political figures towards the Soviet Union has recently become noticeable. For example, the Japanese military has spread provocative news about the Soviet government and the future Soviet ambassador to China. Regardless of the fact that the Soviet government has firmly denied these anti-Soviet rumors, Japanese Foreign Minister Uchida reiterated the old trick in his speech to the Japanese parliament on January 21.</p>
<p>These anti-Soviet rumors collapse on their own and do not need to be refuted. As for the restoration of Sino-Soviet diplomatic relations, the Soviet government resolves this issue regardless of who benefits and who does not. It knows that it is based on the interests of general peace and its own peace policy.</p>
<p>Uchida declared in the Japanese Diet that since the Manchurian Incident, no unpleasant incidents have occurred in Soviet-Japanese relations because the Soviet government has maintained a "cautious stance." This should be especially pointed out: the issue is not that Soviet policy is cautious; this policy is not only cautious but also carefully considered. The starting point for the Soviet government is based on the interests of general peace and the consolidation of external peace interests. Regardless of how other countries evaluate this peace policy, the Soviet government will resolutely implement it in its foreign relations to the end.</p>
<p>The international environment also reminds the Soviet Union to be deeply vigilant, especially the need to pay special attention to the situation in the Far East. This must be reflected in all work and all construction endeavors. In 1933, there must be greater progress in socialist construction because the consolidation of the Soviet Union's internal and external situation depends entirely on the victory of its economic work.

<h3 id="e54">Feng Yuxiang Advocates Strenuous Counter-Offensive <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Demands Yuguan and Rehe be Recovered Soonest; Zhangjiakou Equals the Frontline, Ready for a Fight</p>
<p>Zhangjiakou Correspondence: The reporter arrived in Zhangjiakou on the Ping-Sui train on the 6th. The next morning at about 8 o'clock, I went to the library on Tuergou South Street, east of the station, to visit Mr. Feng Yuxiang. Two guards with broadswords stood guard at the door, amiable and kind. Seeing the reporter arrive, they first raised their hands in salute. After inquiring about my intention, they passed my card in. Soon, two young men came out to greet me. I learned their names were Jin Qingyu and Li Zhongyi, and they were very hospitable. After I explained my intention, they replied that Mr. (i.e., Mr. Feng) was currently teaching and had no time to meet. I asked when he would be free, and they replied at 5:00 p.m. I asked how Mr. Feng was doing recently. They said that Mr. Feng gets up at 6:00 a.m. and starts his daily lessons at 8:00 a.m., such as English, Sinology, political economy, and social sciences, and also practices calligraphy, painting, growing vegetables, and walking. The time is from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., and from 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. He declines all social engagements and rarely goes out. After the Yuguan Incident, Mr. Feng sent his family to another place, striving to think quietly. Whenever I see him in his spare time after class, patting his thigh and wielding a sword, I can see his deep concern for the country. The reporter then left and returned at 5:00 p.m., when Mr. Feng agreed to meet me. Mr. Feng wore cloth cotton clothes and trousers, a fur-lined blue cloth overcoat, and old-fashioned cotton shoes. After entering the living room, he took off his overcoat, with a warm smile and full of energy. He said repeatedly, "Sir, you have come such a long way in this cold weather to see me. I am too unworthy." The reporter explained the purpose of his visit to Zhangjiakou, and he answered sincerely. The record of his conversation is as follows: "Now the enemy is invading us, step by step, closer and closer. We have no way to survive except to resist. At this time, to deal with the current situation, we should be clear about right and wrong, and distinguish black and white. For example, Tang Yulin abandoned Chengde without a fight. Not only should the government strictly arrest and punish him, but the people should also automatically rise up and chop him. If not, how can we show the national spirit of the Nineteenth Route Army's sacrifice for the country? And there is no truth in the world. I advocate that all of Tang Yulin's property should be confiscated to subsidize the anti-Japanese military expenses or to relieve the refugees in Rehe Province. Now the enemy is approaching us, and we must strive to counter-attack. Yuguan and Rehe must be recovered as soon as possible. We need to fight several more fierce battles. Even if we lose the battle, we will leave behind a national spirit that will last forever. Seeing that we are about to become slaves of a conquered nation, the people of the whole country should quickly rise up to resist Japan. Those who resist Japan are good friends, and those who do not resist Japan are traitors. At this time, we must all rise up together to overthrow the traitors who do not resist Japan. I believe that at this time of national crisis, all kinds of groups should be able to say what they want to say. People's groups should strengthen their forces. The power of the people is the most important thing to save the country. Furthermore, speaking of my going to Nanjing, now that the enemy is in the north, I have no need to go south. And there is a rumor that I am going to Taiyuan. The enemy is now in the east, so why should I go west? After the September 18th Incident, I have always advocated using force to recover the lost territories. People should have self-knowledge and measure their own virtue and ability. I am really not qualified to lead people to do it. Now Zhangjiakou is also the front line. I still have two guns. I can shoot with both my left and right hands. And with my comrades, I will definitely be able to fight to the death with them. Finally, I hope that the people will strengthen their forces to stand on the front line, and I will stand in the middle of this front line," and so on. Later, the reporter asked if Li Xiehe had come to see Mr. Feng. He replied that Li was about to come and showed a telegram he had received that day. The reporter then bid farewell. (7th)</p>
<h3 id="e55">A Bird's-Eye View of Chahar <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Residents in Zhangjiakou Have Left; People are Carrying Out Patriotic Movements; Business Circles Eagerly Await Sino-Mongolian Trade</p>
<p>Zhangjiakou Correspondence: Since the Japanese army invaded and occupied Chengde, the Japanese army has intended to peek into Chahar Province. Therefore, the position of Chahar Province is becoming increasingly important. I will record the recent situation of Chahar Province as follows for the attention of the people of the country.</p>
<p>The northeast of Chahar Province borders Rehe. Duolun Nuoer (i.e., Duolun County) in the north faces Linyao in Rehe, and is a passage into Rehe. Therefore, Rehe and Chahar provinces have a relationship of interdependence. Whether Chahar Province can be preserved depends on Rehe. Now the Japanese residents in Zhangjiakou have completely left Chahar and returned to their country. The Japanese consulate in Zhangjiakou is also preparing to lower its flag and withdraw to Beiping. Chahar Province is an important route to Kulun. When Sino-Mongolian trade was conducted in the past, merchants gathered in Zhangjiakou and Duolun, and commerce was concentrated. Since the cessation of Sino-Mongolian trade, Zhangjiakou's commerce has declined sharply, and it has not yet returned to its former glory. Chahar Province has a total of sixteen counties, which is equal to the number of counties in Rehe and Suiyuan. The population is more than 460,000 people. The province's annual income is 3 million yuan, which is not enough for government expenses. Therefore, after the national implementation of cutting taxes in the 19th year of the Republic, Chahar Province was the only province that did not implement cutting taxes due to financial difficulties. To this day, what Chahar Province relies on to maintain the situation is taxes. Education in Chahar Province has developed greatly recently, but the people's thinking is stubborn and has the style of Mongolians. There are a total of six middle schools and normal schools in the province. People's education is also quite developed. Chahar Province has no major production. Several northern counties border Outer Mongolia and produce furs and skins. The people's staple food is oil noodles. The province produces millet and wheat, which can be used for the province and can also be transported to Hebei. The province is mostly mountainous, and the climate is severely cold. In March and April of spring, people still wear leather clothes. Since Rehe issued a warning, the people of Chahar Province have also organized an anti-Japanese association. It has now united all sectors of the party, government, military, academia, and business, and has begun to carry out patriotic movements, and is raising funds to comfort the anti-Japanese soldiers at the front and to comfort the families of the soldiers who died in battle. Since Feng Yuxiang went to Zhangjiakou from Taian in October of last year, he has gone to the library in his residence and closed the door to read books. He has repeatedly expressed his determination to resist Japan. According to Feng, if the central government is determined to resist Japan, he himself, even if he is a soldier carrying a gun, will be happy to kill the enemy in the vanguard. This shows that Feng does not choose a position on the issue of resisting Japan and is willing to share his determination with the central government. Feng also said that whether or not to go to Nanjing is not a problem. The anti-Japanese work is not in the region, which shows his frankness. Since China and Russia restored diplomatic relations, Sino-Mongolian merchants have begun to travel back and forth. Chinese merchants in Kulun are no longer treated harshly by the Outer Mongolian government. Any Chinese merchant with a passport can enter the country. Before Sino-Mongolian trade officially began, the German company Dehua Foreign Firm contracted Sino-Mongolian trade affairs for one year. The foreign firm is located in Zhangjiakou. In the past year, the trade with Kulun amounted to 5 million yuan in Chinese currency. The goods transported to Outer Mongolia were mainly Shandong silk, brick tea, leather boots, stirrups, and domestic cloth. The goods imported from Outer Mongolia were mainly furs, crystals, mushrooms, and deer antlers. The automobiles between Zhangjiakou and Kulun can now travel unimpeded. After the implementation of trade with Outer Mongolia, not only will the commerce of Chahar and Suiyuan provinces be able to turn around, but also the commerce of North China will be able to develop. Therefore, the business community here is eagerly awaiting the official resumption of Sino-Mongolian trade as soon as possible, so as not to be contracted by foreign firms.</p>

<p>It Was Expected That the League of Nations Would Not Sanction Japan; There May Be New Paths Discovered by Going North to Meet Chiang</p>
<p>Beijing News: Minister to Japan Jiang Zuobin arrived in Beijing by the Shanghai-Nanjing night train early (11th) morning at eight o'clock. After getting off the train, he went to his private residence in Shatangyuan to rest. He will go north to meet Chairman Chiang within a few days to report everything. Mr. Jiang made the following remarks to those who visited him:</p>
<h3 id="e57">The Future of Sino-Japanese Relations is Worrying <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Question: The Japanese army's occupation of Rehe has made the future of Sino-Japanese relations even worse. What does the gentleman think is the plan to save the situation? Answer: Resistance is of course legitimate self-defense, but judging from the resistance situation in Rehe, our army retreated without a fight. However, the future prospects for the situation with Japan are very worrying. Moreover, Japan sees that it has acquired Rehe so easily, which was initially unexpected. The desires of ambitious people will be even greater. Therefore, it is difficult to say at this time whether the Japanese army in China will be able to declare a conclusion after occupying Rehe. And seeing that it is so easy to occupy Chinese territory, it is common sense to gain an inch and then seek a yard. Question: Then will Suiyuan and Chahar, which border Rehe, be in frequent danger? Answer: When I left Japan to return to China, I had not yet received news of the Japanese army's attack on Chahar and Suiyuan. However, whether the Japanese army in North China can stop military operations at this time depends on whether our country can resist and the degree of resistance.</p>
<h3 id="e58">League of Nations Sanctions Japan <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Question: Since the League of Nations does not implement sanctions against violent Japan, and our country's resistance situation is like this, what will happen to Japan in the end? Answer: It was not until today that I knew that the League of Nations could not sanction Japan. It was already in my mind long ago. China's own affairs, hoping for the assistance of the League of Nations, the starting point is only a reliance. Therefore, the hope for the League of Nations was originally a kind of hope that was secondary, not the only one. The main thing lies in the determination of the whole country to resist with perseverance and the spirit of striving for self-improvement. Now that the League of Nations does not sanction Japan, we do not need to be too disappointed. In the end, we will be able to be self-aware and fight. There is still something to tell, that is, do not passively hope that Japan will fall by itself, only actively strive for self-improvement in China. Question: There is a lot of talk about the Anglo-Japanese alliance. What is the truth? Answer: The Anglo-Japanese alliance has not yet reached a completely mature stage. What the outside world is saying may also be an exaggerated inference. Question: The United Kingdom advocates banning the sale of arms to China and Japan. This is undoubtedly indirect assistance to Japan. We therefore have doubts about the Anglo-Japanese alliance. Answer: The United Kingdom's advocacy of banning the sale of arms to China and Japan is of great importance to our country, but the impact on Japan is very small because Japan is a newly emerging industrial country, and everything is fully prepared.</p>
<h3 id="e59">There Will Eventually Be a New Path <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Question: Then under the pressure of Japanese aggression, what policy can our country use to survive? Answer: Since the League of Nations does not sanction Japan, and the resistance situation in Rehe is like this, the future of China is very worrying. However, there will eventually be a new path. It must not be like walking on the road, so that there is no way to go. Question: What is the new path that the gentleman is talking about? Answer: I have no preconceived notions about this.

<h3 id="e60">Japanese Troops in Wuhan Create Disturbances <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Salt Police Open Fire to Seize Smugglers, Japanese Troops Act as if Facing a Great Enemy</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: When the war in Rehe first started, the Japanese troops stationed in Wuhan actively made military deployments and intended to provoke. When our side maintained calmness, the Japanese had no chance to take advantage of, and the situation gradually eased. However, they are still secretly seizing the opportunity to move. The tight security of the Japanese concession and the reconnaissance of Japanese warships back and forth are no different from when things were tense. Recently, there are four Japanese warships stationed in Wuhan: Atago, Tsushima, Atami, and Hira, with a total of more than 1,000 marines. Commander Sakano of the 3rd Overseas Dispatch Fleet is stationed on the Atago flagship to command. On the evening of the 10th, the marines of the Tsushima ship caused trouble due to a misunderstanding because the salt bureau police opened fire to seize smugglers. It was not explained until the morning of the 11th. It turned out that the anti-smuggling battalion under the jurisdiction of the Hubei Shore Salt Bureau Inspection Office sent teams of soldiers to secretly investigate various wharves in the city in order to investigate and seize smuggled salt. At about 9 p.m. on the 10th, the soldiers of the battalion discovered several boats on the river in front of Eleven Pier 3 carrying salt to smuggle. Because the boats refused to approach the shore, they fired two shots, intending to scare them into submission. After the Japanese warship Tsushima, which was moored on the river at the intersection of the Japanese special zone, discovered the gunfire, it immediately ordered the marines to land fully armed and deploy in the Japanese concession, as if facing a great enemy, and sent plainclothes detectives to investigate our actions. At that time, Chen Haiqing, the director of the Eleven Pier, reported the truth of the shooting to the Japanese military authorities by telephone through the president of the Tongren Hospital nearby. The marines of the ship withdrew to the ship at 2 a.m. on the 11th. The Wuhan Garrison Command stated that the General Headquarters and the Pacification Commissioner's Office had long expressly prohibited arbitrary shooting in the garrison area. The current situation is serious, and it is even more impermissible to deliberately violate the prohibition and disrupt order and tranquility. It immediately sent a letter to the Salt Bureau Inspection Office to severely punish the tax police who fired without authorization and presented the situation to the General Headquarters and the Pacification Commissioner's Office for review and approval, and requested a reaffirmation of the prohibition to ensure security. In addition, the Japanese concession held a conscription inspection on the 10th, and all those of conscription age returned to their country. It is said that there was also a disturbance, but the details are unknown. (March 11)</p>

<p>At 5 p.m. on the 11th, on the hillside of Jiuyao Mountain, opposite Chishan Bu in West Lake, four young men and women were found to have committed suicide by poison. Their deaths were gruesome. The local police station reported the incident to the Hangzhou District Court. This afternoon, Court Prosecutor Zhu Henghua, accompanied by Coroner Feng Shengxiang, went to conduct an examination. The four young people wore badges from the Anhui Provincial Fourth Middle School. One of the males was about 23 or 24 years old, and the other was about 20 years old. The older one wore a dark student uniform with a woolen overcoat, and the younger one wore a cotton robe over a blue cloth long gown. When their clothes were removed, they each wore a sports undershirt with the red characters "Wan Hun" (Anhui Soul) and "Chong Xiao" (Soaring Ambition) respectively. Both girls wore gray cloth qipaos with cloth jackets. All four had foam in their mouths, and their teeth and nails were black. The cause of the suicide is unknown. A thorough search of their belongings revealed only a pencil on one of the girls. In the pocket of the male student wearing the blue robe was a notice from the Anhui Provincial Fourth Middle School to the parents of student He Jiazhang informing them of his expulsion, along with a ship ticket for the Yihe Company in Anqing and a few small silver and copper coins. General speculation is that the four students were classmates at Anhui Fourth Middle School. Due to a romantic entanglement, they neglected their studies and were expelled. They came to Hangzhou after many twists and turns and, due to financial difficulties, this tragic event occurred.</p>

Around 6:00 PM, he returned to his temporary residence at No. 181 Fuxu Road, waiting for his wife to arrive in Shanghai before traveling abroad together.

<p>After the Ford airplane carrying Mr. Zhang and his party departed from Beiping in the morning, various dignitaries in Shanghai arrived at the airport one after another around 12:30 PM to welcome them, according to the expected itinerary. However, after waiting for three hours, the airplane had not yet arrived in Shanghai. Subsequently, Mr. Song Ziwen ordered the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Finance to inquire by radio. Around 3:00 PM, the airplane was spotted in the northeast corner of the airport. Soon, it flew closer and closer, and at 3:10 PM, it circled to the south and landed. After the airplane stopped, the Public Security Bureau's military band played music to welcome them. Mr. Zhang immediately exited the airplane amidst the music and shook hands with Wu Tiecheng, Song Ziwen, and others, exchanging a few words of greeting. After taking a group photo, he, along with his secretary Li Yingchao, advisor Donald, and Song Ziwen, rode in Song's car number "844" to the Song residence on Qizhi Road in the French Concession for a rest.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Mr. Zhang Appears Thin and Haggard <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Those who arrived with Zhang Xueliang on the airplane yesterday included his secretary Li Yingchao, Western advisor Donald, three adjutants named Liu Wangyu, and medical officer Chen, as well as attendants, totaling nine people.

<p>After Mr. Zhang arrived at the Song residence, those who welcomed him also followed to the Song residence and sat and talked for half an hour. At that time, Mr. Zhang and those who welcomed him had not yet had lunch, so the Song residence prepared a meal for them. Later, because Mr. Zhang was tired from the journey, he took a nap at the Song residence. Those who welcomed him then took their leave separately. At 1:45 PM, he was accompanied by Acting President of the Executive Yuan Song to take a car to No. 181 Fuxu Road where he was staying. Mr. Zhang's residence at No. 181 Fuxu Road was temporarily rented by Du Yuesheng, and the President of the Executive Yuan Song dispatched six guards to take care of him. At the same time, the French Concession police and the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession also temporarily dispatched several detectives to guard the area, so the protection was very thorough. Because Fuxu Road is located at the border between the two concessions, it was decided for convenience to change the gate on Fuxu Road to the front gate on Julai Road for entry and exit.</p>

As for me personally, I have been relieved of this heavy responsibility and can now spend my leisure time studying and cultivating myself, increasing my knowledge, and becoming a good citizen. This is something I have always sought but could not obtain. Now that I can achieve this hope, I deeply hope that members of society and my friends will all treat me as an ordinary citizen. How fortunate I am! As for national affairs, what I know is also what you know, so there is nothing I can tell you." Zhang Xueliang, 12th.</p>

<p>Chairman Jiang Huaisu Delivers a Somber Speech</p>
<p>Yesterday was the eighth anniversary of the death of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the leader of the Kuomintang. The municipal party headquarters convened various sectors to hold a memorial meeting at 9:00 AM in the auditorium of the party headquarters on Lin Yin Road. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e85">Representatives Present <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>In addition to all the staff of the municipal party headquarters, representatives from various sectors who attended included Zhang Mengling from the Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Gao Jie and Li Wanqing from the Gao San Branch of the Court, Xu Qi from the Navigation Administration Bureau, Guan Zhijiang and Zheng Qingzhen from the First Special District Court, Zheng Letian from the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, Liu Binglin from the Jianghai Customs Supervisory Office, Li Yongxiang from the General Labor Union, representatives from the lighterage, cosmetics, cement, hat making, cotton spinning, military uniform, shipping, timber, and rubber industries labor unions, and representatives from Aiguo, Wuben, Junyi, Wanzhu, Peiben, Bide, Yihang, He'an, Yugong, Dongshan, Yangzheng, Dongming, Yongxing, and other schools, totaling over two hundred people. Chairman Jiang Huaisu presided, and Fan Mingyao served as master of ceremonies.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Memorial Ceremony <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>The memorial ceremony was as follows: (1) Opening, (2) Singing the party song, (3) Paying the highest respects to the party flag, the national flag, and the portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, (4) Chairman respectfully reading Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will, (5) Three minutes of silence, (6) Chairman's report, (7) Speech, (8) Shouting slogans, (9) Conclusion of the ceremony.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Chairman's Speech <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>After the ceremony, Chairman Jiang Huaisu gave a report, stating briefly that the people have lost their support since Dr. Sun Yat-sen left us eight years ago. The words and deeds of Dr. Sun Yat-sen during his lifetime are worthy of our permanent commemoration. Although Dr. Sun Yat-sen has been dead for eight years, the spirit of Dr. Sun Yat-sen has not died. Not only has it not died, but it is becoming brighter and brighter and becoming more evident with time. Now, in this time of serious national crisis, we should take the fearless spirit of Dr. Sun Yat-sen as our teacher in commemorating Dr. Sun Yat-sen. In the three minutes of silence, everyone's minds were thinking about the spirit of hard struggle of Mr. Sun Yat-sen during his lifetime. In the late Qing Dynasty, the national situation was more critical than it is now. If there had been no Dr. Sun Yat-sen to lead the revolution, China would have been divided up and jointly governed long ago. How could it have been maintained until today? Today, the people have a national concept in mind, but at that time, they only knew about their families and had no national thought. Now, if we want to save China from danger, we should implement Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will. When the September 18th Incident occurred, two provinces were lost. However, the people of Shanghai thought it was not in front of them and continued to enjoy themselves. It is truly a case of "the merchant girls do not know the hatred of a lost nation and still sing backyard flowers across the river." By the time of the January 28th Incident, the people of Shanghai were full of enthusiasm because the sound of gunfire was close. But now, if someone tells them about the situation in the Northeast, they don't care because there is no gunfire. It's really like "not burning incense in ordinary times, but hugging the Buddha's feet when things get urgent." But Shanghai was under airplane bombs last year, and the Northeast is now. The Party and the country are working hard to save the country by air, and they support and believe in the government to take unified steps. Next, He Wenbo from the Singapore Tongde News Agency gave a speech and then the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3 id="e92">Opening Ceremony <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>At 11:00 AM, the opening ceremony was held. Mayor Wu Tiecheng presided over the event. The Public Security Bureau military band played music, and the audience paid the highest respects to the party flag, the national flag, and the portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. After three minutes of silence to commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the tree planting song was sung. The chairman then delivered a speech, and representatives from various sectors gave speeches in succession. Tree planting then began, and the event ended at 1:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Opening Speech <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Mayor Wu delivered an opening speech saying, "Ladies and gentlemen, today is the eighth anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death. Sun Yat-sen can be said to have lived for the Chinese nation and died for the Chinese nation. We who have not died should continue his unfinished will and implement all of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will one by one to achieve the goal of saving the country. Don't just talk about it and not do it. True followers of Dr. Sun Yat-sen who implement the Three Principles of the People should strive to implement Dr. Sun Yat-sen's national salvation plan and the new national salvation plan of this city. Therefore, the government has designated the anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death as Tree Planting Day to promote the tree planting movement. We were born in southern China, and we haven't seen forests everywhere. The wood used in our houses is mostly foreign goods. The reason for our annual floods and droughts is the lack of forests. Our most forested area is the three northeastern provinces. The huge forests cover hundreds of miles. The timber used by the people in the Northeast is all taken locally and does not need to be purchased from foreign countries. Not only is it sufficient for local use, but it can also be supplied to the south. However, the three northeastern provinces have been occupied by the Japanese. The forests in the northwest cannot be developed and transported due to inconvenient transportation. My country purchases about 14 million yuan of timber from foreign countries every year. Forests are closely related to people's health and floods and droughts. The afforestation movement should be promoted by the people of the whole country to save the country by planting trees. Planting trees is also saving the country. Our 400 million people are too uncompetitive. The Japanese have few people but a strong country, and their nation is prosperous. Our country has a large land and abundant resources, but it is only useful if we can use it. We should develop resources everywhere and work hard on production, so that money will not flow out and the country can turn from weak to strong and national shame can be washed away. Doing things must have a beginning and an end. I hope everyone will work hard."</p>
<h3 id="e94">Pan and Wang Deliver Speeches <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Next, Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Education, delivered a speech, briefly saying that today is the anniversary of the eighth anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death. Mayor Wu has talked about the significance of tree planting. I have seen various slogans today, saying that tree planting can increase people's health. This is indeed true, because trees can regulate the air and make people feel happy. Now I will only talk about the "planting" character in tree planting. The so-called "straight wood" can become good timber, just like a person's standing. But to produce good timber, we must protect it after planting. People in the student age need to increase their knowledge to become talents for society. Therefore, tree planting and being a person are equally important. Planting more trees becomes a forest, and joining groups becomes a strong nation. Therefore, I hope that the teachers and students of various schools who participate today will be inspired by this. Next, Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, delivered a speech, briefly saying that trees are planted and wood becomes timber, and people are upright and become useful. Therefore, tree planting and cultivating talents are equally important. To make tree planting excellent, we only need to pay attention to protection, but the cultivation of talents requires both teacher education and self-study. Therefore, I hope that all of you who participate today will work harder to become great talents, so that you will be useful to the country. Otherwise, I am afraid that there will be someone who is not as good as a tree.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Jin Qingzhang, County Magistrate of Baoshan, led personnel from various agencies and people from all walks of life, about 500 people, to hold a tree planting ceremony next to the Dachang bus station. After the ceremony, County Magistrate Jin delivered a speech, briefly saying, "Now that spring has arrived, everyone can get up and plant trees. There are about two benefits to planting trees. First, don't the things we directly benefit from made of wood? Such as the stools we sit on, the tables we lie on, and the houses that shelter us from the wind and rain, are all made of trees. Therefore, the use of trees is greater than anything else, so we want everyone to get up and plant trees. The second is indirect benefits. Isn't my country often flooded? Because there is a lack of wood in the area. The ground with many trees can hold a large amount of water, so even heavy rain will not cause a disaster. If trees are planted next to the river bank, the river bank will not collapse, and trees can avoid wind disasters. If there are forests, the wind will be blocked, and crops will not suffer a tragic fate. In addition, it increases fun, and the benefits are endless. Let's all get up and plant trees quickly." The tree planting ceremony then concluded and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>According to Dagongshe, a major dispute occurred at Shenxin Mill No. 1 in Zhoujiaqiao, western Shanghai. During the evening shift change at 6:00 PM the night before, a misunderstanding arose when security guards searched workers, leading to a shooting that injured several workers.

<p>Incident Details</p>
<p>According to the factory's practice, security guards hired by the factory inspect workers by name at the end of their shifts to prevent theft of yarn. The previous night, during the 6:00 PM shift change, a worker surnamed Wang and the head of the security guards, Li Nianfa, had a verbal altercation due to a misunderstanding. (On the 10th, a foreman named Liu Jinrong also had a dispute with security guards during an inspection, which was resolved after colleagues intervened.) As workers gathered during the shift change, the argument escalated, and violence broke out. Outnumbered, the security guards blew their whistles frantically. More than twenty security guards from across the factory rushed to the scene, leading to a major confrontation. Amid the chaos, security guards fired their weapons in an attempt to break free. Upon seeing the guards open fire, the workers fled in panic. More than ten workers fell into the Suzhou River while trying to cross the river by ferry, and more than twenty were injured in the crush. Eleven workers sustained serious gunshot wounds. Following the incident, the Zhoujiaqiao Police Station of the Sixth District Public Security Bureau dispatched a team of officers led by Inspector Wei to the scene to maintain order. Wen Hongen, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and Tan, Director of the Sixth District, also arrived at the scene to inspect the situation after receiving reports.</p>

<p>Chinese Academic Circles Commemorate the 50th Anniversary of Karl Marx's Death</p>
<p>This year, March 14th, marks the 50th anniversary of Karl Marx's death. Academic circles around the world are preparing for grand commemorations. It is reported that over a hundred people in Chinese academic circles, including Cai Yuanpei, Ye Yuhu, Jiang Hengyuan, Zhang Yunhe, Zhang Yi, Tao Zhixing, Li Gongpu, Zhu Duomin, Zhang Naiqi, Li Shishen, Chen Wangdao, and Huang Renzhi, are also initiating a memorial meeting for the 50th anniversary of Marx's death and are preparing to publish a commemorative volume of several hundred thousand words. The origin of the association is as follows: Karl Marx passed away on March 14, 1883. This year marks the 50th anniversary of his death. In these short fifty years, the impact of Marx's theories on the world has been significant. For fifty years, people around the world, whether they hated or loved, destroyed or praised Marx, have generally agreed that Marx was a great thinker and the founder of modern scientific socialism. In recent years, in our country, because of the opposition to the Communist Party, Marx's thoughts and theories have been implicated. Even those who speak of them are considered guilty, and those who study them are also considered guilty. This idea should be broken. The emergence of an idea and the establishment of a theory are not accidental miracles. If we can base ourselves on a pure academic research standpoint, then whether we agree or disagree, we should seriously study such ideas and theories. Only through research can we agree, and only through research can we disagree. Truth can only be approached through research. Now, because of the opposition to the Communist Party, Marx's thoughts and theories have been implicated. This is blind and is a kind of ideological Boxer Rebellion. We are now initiating the Memorial Meeting for the 50th Anniversary of Marx's Death based on a pure academic research standpoint, to pay sincere respect to this great modern thinker. At the same time, it is also a pioneering effort to promote freedom of research and freedom of thought and break the ideological Boxer Rebellion that has been prevalent in our country's academic circles in recent years. It is also reported that the Intellectual Development Department of the Shanghai YMCA on Eight Immortals Bridge will simultaneously hold a lecture series on scientific socialism, giving public lectures on the 14th and 15th of this month, from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM each evening. The speakers have been confirmed as Cai Yuanpei, Zhang Naiqi, Li Shicen, and Chen Wangdao.</p>

<p>Record of the Opening of the Shanghai Native Cloth Store</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Farmers' Education Center, recognizing the growing crisis in the rural economy and the increasing encroachment of the Japanese, has been working to promote the cause of locally made cloths, focusing on production projects and the promotion of physical exercise. Last year, the center held two native cloth exhibitions that were well-received by people from all walks of life. To facilitate the need for cloth, the center initiated the establishment of the Shanghai Native Cloth Store at the Penglai Market on Penglai Road. At the time, a preparatory committee was organized, with Zhang Yi, Shi Yangyong, Zheng Yi, Ping Guanqiu, Shen Zhupo, Hu Wuxu, Wang Renfu, Peng Liren, Tang Shuming, Lu Jiren, and others jointly preparing for the store's opening. Prominent figures in the Party and state, as well as local gentry, have all expressed strong support. Preparations have been underway for three years, and the internal organization has been completed. Yesterday was the official opening day of the store, and visitors came in a constant stream. The details are recorded as follows:</p>

<p>Store Display</p>
<p>The store's display is exquisite and impressive. All products are hand-woven by rural farmers, using entirely domestic raw materials. The patterns and colors are designed by the county's native cloth improvement program. Items such as overcoat fabric, old-patterned cloth, Yunxia cloth, Heping cloth, Ziyou cloth, Xuechi cloth, and Fendou cloth are most suitable for modern wear. To offer preferential treatment to patriotic individuals, the store offers uniform discounts on all cloth items. From 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM in the afternoon, the store offers old rescue cloth most suitable for the current era, selling each bolt for only one yuan and six cents.</p>

<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>The chairman's opening speech stated that today is the opening ceremony of the Shanghai Native Cloth Store, and it is an honor to have everyone present. The establishment of the Shanghai Native Cloth Store is intended to promote the sale of authentic domestic native cloth and to increase farmers' production. Shanghai is a large metropolis with a vast territory and a large population, so it is necessary to start with Shanghai to promote sales, which will be more effective. Farmers in this county engage in weaving as a sideline in addition to farming. In recent years, foreign goods have flooded the market, and the proportion of Chinese people wearing native cloth is less than two-tenths, resulting in sluggish sales of native cloth and a deteriorating livelihood for farmers. Our country is based on agriculture, and if the rural economy collapses, then the vitality of the nation will inevitably decline. Our country has a population of 400 million. If everyone buys 3 yuan less of foreign goods each year, then we can reduce the outflow of money by 1.2 billion yuan each year. This is of great significance to the national economy. I hope everyone will pay attention to it. In recent years, the dumping of Japanese cotton fabrics into China has been astonishing, and unscrupulous merchants are recklessly passing off inferior goods as domestic goods to deceive the Chinese people, which is extremely distressing. Now, the Shanghai County Farmers' Education Center and others, in light of the above, are working hard to improve native cloth, and the quality of the products has been improving in recent years, comparable to imported goods. Moreover, the government is also working hard to promote it, and both the business tax and export tax on native cloth are exempt. The purpose is to (1) defeat the economic aggression of the imperialists, (2) relieve the bankruptcy of the rural economy. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Municipal Education Bureau are visiting all sectors and schools to promote native cloth as much as possible. Therefore, I hope that everyone present today will work hard to spread the word, which will be fortunate for the country.</p>

<p>Director's Admonition</p>
<p>Shi She, Director of the County Education Bureau, gave an admonition, stating that the poor state of China's economy has reached an extreme point. Most of the reason for this is that the Chinese people do not like to use domestic goods. In the past few years, the bankruptcy of the national economy has become worse and worse, and the suffering of farmers is particularly deep. Now, the Shanghai Farmers' Education Center has established the Native Cloth Store in order to alleviate this crisis, which can prevent the outflow of profits and increase farmers' production. Therefore, I hope that all sectors will make every effort to promote it. Zhang Shi, Peng Liren, Xu Guanghua, Bi Huan, and others then gave speeches. (Speeches omitted for length.)</p>

<p>Sichuan Army Victory Telegram in Suppressing the Communists</p>
<p>Wang Ya'te, the representative of the Sichuan-Shaanxi Border Area Communist Suppression Supervisory Office stationed in Shanghai, received a telegram from Tian Songyao, which stated: "To Wang Shuxian in Shanghai, according to the report from Commander-in-Chief Sun Zhen, our army's Central Column, Luo Naiqiong's division, and a part of the Right Column, Zeng Xiandong's division, after a fierce battle this morning at 9:00 AM, captured Bazhong City. The communist bandits suffered heavy casualties and are retreating in disarray. We are currently pursuing them, etc."</p>
<p>Another telegram stated: "Urgent, to Wang Shuxian in Shanghai, (1) Commander Luo's column has not yet telegraphed that our Zhu and Song regiments completely occupied Bazhong City at 9:00 AM this morning. The bandits retreated towards Jianshanping, Qingjiangdu, and Silinchang. Our army is currently pursuing them from Wangwang Mountain, Chaqi Mountain, and Tazi Mountain. (2) Division Commander Liu's telegram stated that the Yang Xiulv regiment has dispatched teams to pursue the bandits from the front of Luojiaba and has now pursued them to the vicinity of Daheitan. This morning, the Hu Jie and Zhang Xiaokang regiments were also dispatched to attack the bandits in the Dayuhui Yinmuba Wulangmiao area. (3) Commander of the Fifth Column reported that the Tong regiment, which was attacking Zhugezhai, has suffered many casualties after repeated attacks. Although mortars were used for bombing, it was not successful. Therefore, in the evening, company commander Zhang Renjie led troops at night, using human ladders to climb over the rocks and enter the fortress. At the same time, platoon leader Li Mingnian and warrant officer He Zhonglin led plainclothes teams to feign attacks from the front. By midnight, our night raiding troops had completely entered the fortress, and the plainclothes teams took the opportunity to swarm in. Therefore, although there were over a thousand bandits, they were all at a loss and fled, falling off the rocks. In this battle, over 300 bandits were killed, including two company commanders, and over a hundred firearms and countless supplies were seized. Our army also suffered 80 to 90 casualties among officers and soldiers. (4) Commander He's telegram stated that Guling Bamiya was first occupied by Lü's regiment of the First Division at dawn. The bandits had no way to retreat and fled in disarray, except for a portion that had previously fled to Zhaizi Xindianzi. Xie Anhua's regiment pursued them to Luojiaba, and the units were blocking and killing the fleeing bandits, which was extremely fierce. Therefore, many bandits fell off the rocks and into the water, and many were captured alive. Even more firearms and supplies were abandoned. (5) Overseer Liu's telegram stated that the Red Army's Tenth Division launched a fierce attack on our Qinglongzhai this morning. Liao's column commander dispatched Wang's regiment to raid the bandits' left flank in Changlezhai and Chen's regiment to raid the bandits' right flank. After a fierce battle until dusk, the officers and soldiers on the fortress rushed down and threw bombs, killing over 200 bandits, and the bandit's fortifications were abandoned. (6) Commander Luo's telegram stated that according to the confession of a surrendered bandit carrying a gun, the elite troops of the bandits were severely damaged in the Changchi battle, resulting in a disastrous defeat. As a result, many bandit officers were dismissed, placed under surveillance, and executed. Recently, the bandits have been divided into several factions, with some advocating defending to the death and others advocating abandoning Tongnanba. There is a great tendency to split up, etc."</p>
<h3 id="e125">Two Charity Organizations Assist the Shaanxi Disaster <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Relief Society: The Chinese and Foreign Relief Society at 12 Renji Road highly values the disaster situation in Shaanxi Province and is sparing no effort in providing relief. According to recent news from the province, last year's wheat harvest in the northwest was almost completely lost. Although there were some soybeans after July, they were insufficient to alleviate the situation. Houses and livestock were sold everywhere, and even fertile land was offered at two yuan per acre, but no one was willing to buy. Residents have fled en masse. Currently, only a few porridge kitchens are maintaining the lives of orphaned children. Upon learning of this tragic situation, the society resolved to purchase a large quantity of relief rice and transport it to Shaanxi for distribution, and to establish multiple porridge kitchens in the disaster areas, costing approximately two thousand yuan per month. Recently, they specially dispatched staff member Mr. Zheng Nansheng to Pukou and other places to purchase miscellaneous sugar, and the Ministry of Railways agreed to provide free transportation to Shaanxi. The first batch of three thousand five hundred and seventy bags has already been loaded by the Jinpu Railway Bureau and directly transported to Tongguan. The second batch of one thousand one hundred and thirty bags will also be shipped out within days. The value of the relief rice is over forty thousand yuan, of which over one thousand five hundred bags were purchased by the Jisheng Society for joint transportation to assist Wugong and other areas in Shaanxi. The Shaanxi disaster has been ongoing for years, and the disaster area is vast. Although there is this large quantity of relief rice, it is like a drop in the bucket and is unlikely to provide substantial relief. It is hoped that charitable individuals both at home and abroad will act with compassion and contribute generously. It must be understood that in these times of national crisis, saving others is saving oneself. Each person saved adds a bit to the country's strength to resist aggression. This not only accumulates merit but also benefits the nation.</p>
<p>Jisheng Society: The Chinese Jisheng Society of this city considers the disaster situation in Shaanxi Province to be particularly severe. The society has previously allocated five thousand yuan to the Jisheng Branch in the province for porridge kitchen expenses and five thousand yuan to the Wugong County shelter, and is currently carrying out relief efforts. Now, as the disaster situation in Wugong, Fufeng, and other counties in the province continues to worsen and grain prices soar, even the middle class are lamenting their empty homes, let alone the poor disaster victims. The Chinese and Foreign Relief Society is shipping two thousand shi of rice to Shaanxi, selecting those most in need for distribution. The society is also transporting one thousand seven hundred shi of relief rice for shipment to Shaanxi to save dying disaster victims. This is only a small portion of the granary. At this time of popular poverty, how can everyone embrace patriotism and make compassionate vows, so that both the northeast and northwest disaster situations can benefit from their generosity? Looking forward, we cannot help but reverently pray.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Work of the Shanghai Municipal Council Public Works Department Last Year <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The Commissioner of Public Works of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Hapgood, stated in his work report for 1932 that the work of the year was unable to maintain normalcy due to the impact of the Sino-Japanese conflict at the beginning of the year, especially in the northern and eastern districts. In February and part of March, the normal public works of these two districts were completely suspended. Most of the staff of the department were used to prepare barbed wire and other fortifications, and vehicles were also concentrated for military emergencies.</p>
<p>Private Construction: Due to the war and other factors, the total value of private construction permits issued this year was only over 18 million taels, only half of that of 1931 (which was over 37 million taels, and 1930 was over 46 million taels). A total of 1,190 applications were received, and 1,218 were approved. The number of old houses demolished was 2,054 Chinese-style and 78 Western-style, most of which were demolished and rebuilt. The staff of the Public Works Department were insufficient to handle the supervision of building regulations. A total of 1,063 violations were discovered and notified during the year, and there were 821 cases of work being carried out without permits. Also, the demolition of old houses, such as the theater at the corner of Er Ma Road and Zhejiang Road, the theater on San Ma Road, and five Chinese-style houses on Edward Road, all experienced accidents, mostly due to the lack of sufficient supervision by specialized personnel.</p>
<p>Elimination of Sheds: The many shacks of the poor in the concession have long been a problem. In 1931, a registration was conducted to facilitate elimination. A total of 2,041 numbers were registered. At the beginning of this year, due to the situation, surveillance was slightly relaxed, and many more were built. It was then resolved to issue a one-month notice to demolish them. A total of 550 were demolished in October. It is very difficult to effectively manage this matter, but this year's method may serve as a warning.</p>
<p>Garbage Removal: This year, 285,776 tons of household garbage were removed, 29,923 tons of street sweepings, and 23,152 tons of sewage from ditches, averaging 928 tons per day. A small portion was transported by boat, and the remainder was used to fill low-lying areas. 38,502 tons were sent to the incinerators on Binlang Road and Maohai Road for incineration. At the end of the year, the furnace on Binlang Road incinerated about 163 tons per day, and the furnace on Maohai Road incinerated about 23 tons per day. The contractor for transporting garbage performed satisfactorily this year, so they have been approved to continue for another year. From mid-March to mid-June, Public Works employees cleared 7,577 tons of garbage in the area north of the concession.</p>
<p>Road Construction: There were no major projects in road construction this year. Roads widened include Avenue Road, Race Course Road, Fuzhou Road, North Sichuan Road, etc., totaling 229,970 square yards of road surface and subgrade. The total length of roads converted to cement-mixed subgrade and paved with asphalt was 1.736 miles. In short, road construction has been delayed for too long, and the accumulation of large-scale projects will become increasingly heavy.</p>
<p>Drainage Works: A total of 1.358 miles of drainage ditches were laid, with pipe diameters ranging from 6 inches to 4 feet 6 inches. Branch pipes were laid for a length of 2.815 miles. Sewage ditches were completed for 4.535 miles, with diameters ranging from 6 inches to 18 inches. Branch pipes were laid for a length of 0.305 miles. Due to unpaid fees, the contractor for cleaning sewage has been replaced.</p>
<p>Land Acquisition: To widen and extend roads, 47 mu, 9 fen, and 4 li of land were acquired this year, involving 121 transactions, with a total payment of 1,413,538 taels. In addition, 11 mu, 5 fen, 5 li, and 9 hao of land were acquired for the expansion of parks and cemeteries, with a payment of 147,413 taels. The land prices were sent to the Land Committee for evaluation four times, and the evaluated price was approximately 47% lower than the original asking price. In addition, the Shanghai Municipal Council also sold several parcels of land, the most important of which was 1.799 mu at the corner of Fuzhou Road and Jiangxi Road, which fetched 371,494 taels, and 2.943 mu at the corner of Chengdu Road and Jing'an Temple Road, which fetched 331,220 taels.</p>
<p>Public Buildings: The various public buildings of the Shanghai Municipal Council that were built and completed this year include the police station on Chengdu Road, Grant Road, and Yulin Road, the police dormitory on Carter Road and Baoding Road, the police hospital on Ward Road, the expansion of the prison on Ward Road, including offices, cells, juvenile cells, workshops, laundry, inmate hospital, and guard residences, the slaughterhouse on Sazelu Road, the Victoria Hospital on Daxi Road, the sanitation branch on Xiaoshadu Road, the small vegetable market on Shankaigong Road, Xiaoshadu Road, and Bianqu Road, the incinerators on Binlang Road and Maohai Road, and the Chinese children's schools on Xinwen Road and Jingzhou Road, etc. In addition, there are the Tangen Road Bridge, the Hongkou Creek bank, and the wharves on Chefoo Road and Chaofeng Road.</p>

<h3 id="e127">The Kidnapping of Korean Mr. Li Chunshan <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>A Long and Tragic Tale, A Major Loss for the Korean Revolution</p>
<p>Since the kidnapping of Korean revolutionary leader Li Chunshan on Luban Road in the Chinese area of ​​Nanshi a few days ago (the 9th), it has aroused deep concern and great attention from Chinese and foreign people in this city. Yesterday, a reporter from this newspaper specially interviewed a certain important Korean personage, a close friend of Mr. Li, to inquire about his views on this case. He was immediately informed one by one, and he recounted in detail Mr. Li's personal experiences and his history of struggle (the following are the words of the gentleman):</p>
<h3 id="e128">Young and Ambitious <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Li is a native of Hongxi-dong, Yizhou-myeon, Yizhou-gun, Pyeonganbuk-do, Korea, and is now forty-nine years old. He lost his father at an early age and was raised by his virtuous widow mother. He was young and ambitious. He initially graduated from Boseong Law School in Gyeongseong, and lamented the fall of his motherland. At the age of twenty-two, he joined the New People's Association and devoted himself to the mass movement. He was arrested once and exiled to a deserted island for a year. After returning to the country, his ambition grew stronger, and he continued to work hard in the revolutionary movement.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Revolutionary Work <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>In 1919, when the Korean Independence Movement was at its peak, Li came to Shanghai to assist Mr. An Chang-ho, who is now trapped, in organizing the Provisional Government. At that time, An served as the Acting President and Prime Minister, and Li served as the Secretary-General. Later, the committee system was changed, and Li served as the Minister of the Interior. Recently, he was appointed as the Director of Political Affairs of the Korean Residents Association. When Mr. Li's work was the most intense, he organized the Restoration Society and the Labor Soldiers Association, and published publications such as the "Blood History of the Korean Independence Movement."</p>
<h3 id="e130">Chinese Nationality <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>According to Mr. Li's original name, Chun-gap, he became a Chinese citizen at the age of thirty-six (1920) and held a naturalization certificate. Last year, the certificate was suddenly lost. He received the No. 11 Nationality Certificate issued by the Ministry of the Interior of the National Government on January 19 of this year. Li's family lives at No. 54 Baokang Lane, Avenue Joffre, French Concession, but since the end of the January 28th Shanghai Incident and the bombing case in Hongkou Park, Li has been in a very dangerous situation.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Fratricide <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Li's situation is actually not dangerous overnight. Does the reporter still remember that last year, at No. 13 Luban Road, French Concession, a detective from a certain country used kidnapping to forcibly kidnap a Korean citizen? At that time, it was actually a trap set by a certain country to capture Li. If you are not annoyed, I would like to trace back and tell you. According to Mr. Li's generous nature, he loves to socialize. If there is a request for a fallen Korean, he can especially help him out. This is your chivalrous nature. I did not expect that the same kind would plan to kill each other.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Designed to Trap <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>One evening, a Korean came to Li's house to visit Li, stating that he had been unemployed for a long time and lacked the means to make a living. He planned to set up a small cafe with friends at No. 13 Luban Road, and asked Li to help him with funds to make it happen. Li readily agreed. Unexpectedly, this Korean was bribed by a detective from a certain country and specially set up this plan to kidnap Li. When the time came, the Korean insisted that Li go to No. 13 to discuss everything with the landlord. Li went with him. After sitting in the room for a while, the Korean suddenly left the room on the pretext.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Escaped Once <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>At that time, there was still a Korean in the room. Knowing that a great disaster was coming to Mr. Li, he realized his conscience and took advantage of the Korean's departure to give Li instructions. Li awoke and fled through the front door. However, as soon as he left the alley, a detective from a certain country had already tracked him into the room. When he chased after Li, it was too late, so he arrested the Korean who had given Li instructions. At that time, after Li escaped, he came to me and told me. I kept him for dinner and filled him with a glass of fine wine to celebrate his escape.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Detective Followed <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Since then, Li has been living in seclusion in the Chinese area of ​​Nanshi, and I have also moved to Luban Road with most of the Koreans to ensure safety. Unexpectedly, since we moved to the Chinese area, a large number of plainclothes detectives from a certain country have been constantly found near the bridge connecting the Chinese and French areas (ie, the junction of Luban Road and Luban Road), secretly monitoring our actions. However, although these people are disguised in Chinese clothes, various characteristics such as the habitual way of walking in wooden clogs, as well as their figure and skin, cannot escape the eyes of our Koreans.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Li has become a bird in a cage, meat on a chopping board. This is not only Mr. Li's misfortune, but also Korea's misfortune. All the Korean citizens are now actively trying to rescue him, but the facts of the case are obvious. Mr. Li is a poor revolutionary and cannot be compared to an ordinary kidnapping for ransom. Moreover, people from a certain country have had a precedent for kidnapping Korean citizens in the French Concession, so the content of this case is self-evident. At this time, what all Korean citizens hope is how your country's Chinese authorities can find a way to rescue him.</p>

<p>What I find most alarming is that when the Korean citizens moved into the Chinese area, they repeatedly requested the competent Second District General Administration to pay more attention to protection, but for almost a year, there has been almost no post on Luban Road. When Mr. Li was kidnapped, he shouted for help, and more than ten passers-by gathered. If there were police officers on duty nearby, Mr. Li might have been spared, or at least the license plate number of the car could have been copied for investigation. However, things have come to this, what else can be said? But after the incident, District Chief Jin of the Second District temporarily added a post in Likou to protect us. The people of the subjugated country have received this great gift, and we are already deeply grateful. We cannot say that it is locking the door after the thief has left, we can only say that it is better late than never. When he said this, he sighed incessantly, and the reporter could only smile bitterly and retreat.</p>
<h3 id="e137">French Fugitive Arrested on German Ship <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The Fugitive Military Criminal, Schwalbe</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that the French fugitive military criminal Schwalbe, who had been extensively searched for six months by French police and detectives in the ocean below the equator, was arrested again on the German merchant ship Kumoran in Shanghai yesterday evening (11th). Schwalbe was stationed in the Far East with the Urmi Michel military ship in 1927. Because he attempted to kill an officer, he was sentenced to death, which was later reduced to life imprisonment and sent to French Guiana in South America for service. The place is directly north of the equator, and the rocks are melting all year round. Schwalbe served for six years and could not bear the pain, so he and three military criminals drove a small boat, carrying fresh water and food, and stole away at night. They were not caught by the chasing ship or overturned by the wind and waves, and arrived at Trinidad, 800 miles away. He then found a job on a German ship, which sailed to Hamburg. After arriving in Germany, he was unemployed for a while, and then joined the Norddeutscher Lloyd's Kumoran ship and came to Shanghai. Detectives in the French Concession of this city had previously received a report that the ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday, and identified Schwalbe as working as a cook on the ship. They immediately notified the French police station, and detectives from the French detective agency and the Tilanqiao police station boarded the ship last night and arrested him.</p>

<p>The Hongkou Epidemic Hospital at Hujiamuqiao was established through fundraising by Zhu Jing'an and others. It has been operating for many years and has achieved remarkable results, but it is temporary in nature, opening every summer and closing every autumn, which is not enough to meet the expectations of the local people. Therefore, last autumn, funds were raised to select a more convenient location at the intersection of Linping Road and Yucai Road, purchased several mu of land, and built hospital buildings, which have been completed. On the 10th of this month, the hospital's buildings were accepted. Dean Zhu Jing'an, Shen Huachen, Chen Silan, economic directors Wang Shenfu and Zhang Peishen, medical directors Lin Chunshan and Zhu Xiaofang, administrative director Tang Jingshou, Dong Gengsan, and hospital directors Cha Jianshi, Jiu Ru, Su Luji, and Zhou Zhaoxiong and other twenty people went to inspect the buildings for a week and found them satisfactory before dispersing. It is heard that the hospital is currently arranging the interior, and once everything is ready, a grand opening ceremony will be held on a fixed date, which will be a grand occasion.</p>

<p>Wang Boyuan, the director of Hongkou Boyuan Hospital on Tongzhou Road, was concerned that there are many factories and workers in the Hongkou area. After the Shanghai Incident, he successively established civilian maternity hospitals and epidemic hospitals. Civilians came to seek medical treatment one after another. Although the expenses were stretched, he could not stop. Recently, he felt that the hospital site was small and insufficient, so he rented Western-style houses behind the Tilanqiao Police Station to expand the hospital's business, and hired Yuan Ciyu and Qian Shuzhen, graduates of Bethel Maternity Hospital, as female directors to fulfill his long-cherished wish. It opened yesterday. Shanghai celebrities Wang Binyan, Zhang Xiaolin, and Dong Xinqin and others, as well as the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Citizens' Union, the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association, etc., all sent gifts to congratulate him. In the future, it will benefit the common people significantly.</p>

<p>Final Judgment by the Supreme Court</p>
<p>Zhao Weixian, a native of Yu and former coach of the Chinese Volunteer Army in the French Concession, who was a battalion commander of the Ministry of Finance's Tax Police Corps, was implicated in the kidnapping case of Wei Tingrong. In August of the 20th year of the Republic, the French police sent detectives to Suzhou to arrest Zhao and bring him to Shanghai, and sent him to the Second Special District Local Court. After the police department filed a public prosecution, Zhao was deemed to be an active serviceman and the court ruled that the public prosecution was not accepted and sent him to the military authorities for handling. Because the police department was dissatisfied, it appealed to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court, which ruled that the appeal was rejected. The police department still expressed its dissatisfaction and filed a third instance appeal with the Nanjing Supreme Court. The details of this case have been reported previously. It is now heard that the Higher Court has tried and ruled on the case, rejected the appeal, and sent the judgment to the Higher Third Branch for the police to deliver.</p>

He is intelligent, proficient in law, talented, eloquent, and has a wide network of friends. He is also engaged in the work of resisting Japan and saving the country. He has always had perseverance and is unyielding. During the May 30th and May 3rd tragedies, he enthusiastically participated and spared no effort. After the September 18th Incident, he led Shanghai University students in saving the country and never gave up. Therefore, anyone who is interested in the national salvation movement after the national crisis almost knows Mr. Zhou. Later, he graduated from the Law School of Fudan University and obtained a Bachelor of Laws degree. He founded the Foreign Affairs Review Monthly in the capital, serving as the editor-in-chief and special reporter for the Central Daily News. He then served in the headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief of the Suppression of Communists in the provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, achieving remarkable results. However, in order to fulfill his long-cherished wish, he has resigned and come to Shanghai to join lawyer Wang Yintai to establish an office on the fourth floor of No. 212 Jiangxi Road to practice law and fulfill his responsibility to protect human rights. When Mr. Zhou left the Faculty of Law and Politics (now Shanghai Law School) organized by Xu Qian in the 15th year of the Republic of China, he and Wang Kaijiang, Pan Rudao and others jointly participated in the establishment of the Faculty of Law (now Shanghai Law School). Therefore, his determination to work for the legal community is his aspiration.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Chen Er'a Is Extremely Shameless <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>He Not Only Abducts and Elopes With Someone Else's Daughter but Also Conspires to Commit Assault</p>
<p>Chen Hongsheng, a 54-year-old local man, makes a living by farming. His home is at No. 25 Longhua Road, Southwest Township. Chen has a daughter named Jinbao, who is 19 years old and waiting to be married. There was a Zhang Er'a from Suzhou, who was 21 years old. In the 20th year of the Republic of China, Zhang worked as a handyman in a shipyard in Longhua. Therefore, in order to facilitate his travel back and forth, he lived near Chen's house with several colleagues. He usually went in and out and saw Jinbao. Although she was a farmer's daughter, she was beautiful and slender. He could not help but be moved, so he took advantage of his free time to tempt her with romantic words and try to seduce her. At that time, Jinbao's love affair was just beginning, and she was fascinated by him. Soon, they became entangled and had a physical relationship. However, because she was embarrassed in front of Chen, she could not do what she wanted, so they agreed to take away Chen's savings of 80 silver dollars, two gold rings, and a pair of gold earrings and elope to the countryside of Suzhou, where they lived together in Zhang's home, intending to live happily ever after. However, Zhang was originally a thief, and after returning to his hometown, he lacked work and had no income, so the family's livelihood became increasingly difficult, and his temperament also changed greatly. He was no longer as gentle and considerate to Jinbao as he was at the beginning. He would often beat her if she disobeyed him slightly, but Jinbao eventually tolerated it. Unexpectedly, Zhang recently ran out of money and suddenly had evil thoughts. He planned to sell Jinbao for money, but the plan was not secret and was discovered by Jinbao. She was greatly shocked and took advantage of Zhang's unpreparedness on January 12 of this year to sneak into Shen and return to her home. She told her father the truth and deeply regretted it. Chen scolded her severely and then asked someone to introduce her to work as a female worker in the Longzhang Paper Mill, where she went out early and returned late every day, and did not let her go out during her free time in order to restrain her. Unexpectedly, Zhang was still unwilling after Jinbao left, so he tracked her to Shanghai and conspired with others to wait on the roadside near the paper mill at about 5:00 a.m. on the morning of the day. After a while, he saw Jinbao coming to work, so he rushed forward and forced her to return to Suzhou. The woman refused to the death. Zhang immediately twisted her to the ground, beat her severely, and used an iron rod to injure her head and legs, causing her to bleed profusely. The woman shouted for help. Zhang and others then dispersed. Before leaving, they said that tomorrow morning at 7:00, I will wait for you at a tea house on Lichang Bridge Street outside Xiaonanmen in Nanshi to have a cup of tea. If you don't come, be careful of your dog's life. When the woman saw Zhang and others go far away, she returned home and told her father. Chen was very angry after hearing this, so he went to the tea house on Guocang Bridge at about 7:00 a.m. yesterday with his relative Sun Changfu and others to reason with Zhang. The two sides disagreed and suddenly started a conflict. The guard police Li Jinming from the 13th post heard the news and rushed to the scene and took both sides into the jurisdiction of the Third Division of the First District. After a preliminary hearing by the director, Zhang was deemed to have abducted someone else's daughter and dared to conspire to commit assault, which was extremely hateful. He immediately ordered that a document be prepared and sent to the bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>Shao Ziliang, a young man from Taizhou, living at No. 31 Zhengjiamuqiao Street, French Concession, is 18 years old this year (he is not yet 17 years old according to the national calendar). He is not engaged in proper business and specializes in robbing opium with his fellow villagers, Chen Meidu and other accomplices, in the concession and other places to make a living. At 4:00 p.m. on the 19th of last month, Shao conspired with a male and a female bandit (both at large). The three of them, wielding pistols, broke into the home of Chen Chaozong, a Chaozhou man, at No. 12 Bulin Lane, Avenue Edouard VII, under the pretext of borrowing 50,000 yuan on government orders. They searched for two hours and robbed cash, gold, jade, and diamond jewelry worth a total of 2,200 yuan. They escaped with the loot. On the third night after the incident, detectives from the French Police Special Agency learned of the incident, arrested Shao at No. 91 Zhengjiamuqiao Street, and seized a pistol, 61 bullets, and 90 yuan in original banknotes, and took him to the police station and sent him to the Second Special Court for public prosecution. After being interrogated, Shao confessed that he had gone to rob with Yongbao and a woman who were at large. The trial has been concluded.

<p>An Overview of the Expansion of the Lianhua Film Company Having striven for more than a year, the Lianhua Film Company has already occupied a prominent position in the film industry both domestically and internationally. Every new film release, no matter where or when, is met with full houses and widespread acclaim, enjoying unprecedented popularity in the national film industry. However, Lianhua adheres to the "Four Nationalisms," namely: to save national films, promote national essence, advocate national industries, and serve the nation. To realize these four nationalisms, the work that needs to be done is extremely arduous. Furthermore, at the recent International Film Festival held in Italy, the National Government selected five national films from the productions of all film companies in the country to participate in the competition, and Lianhua productions accounted for four of them. This is the first time that national films have won such international honor. The National Government, recognizing Lianhua's excellent productions and relentless self-improvement, has not only given awards from time to time, but has also recently adopted Lianhua's proposed cooperation methods. As for the cinemas in various regions, they all seek Lianhua films, to the extent that a theater cannot be considered a major theater if it does not show Lianhua films. Because of all these factors, Lianhua feels even more strongly the greatness of its mission and the importance of its responsibility, and has decided to expand its organization and enrich its content, in order to make the quality of its future productions even better and the quantity even greater, planning to release 36 films each year. The expansion plan is currently underway. It is said that the existing film studios will be consolidated into one place, and the latest equipment will be purchased. In terms of distribution, in addition to uniting over a hundred domestic cinemas, it is also said that sales channels in Nanyang and Europe and America will be opened. Judging from Lianhua's past achievements, all of these expansion plans will definitely be completed in the near future. If the extinction of national films is to be avoided, one cannot but hope that Lianhua will be able to revive them.</p>

<p>Glamorous nightlife is the door to seduction, secret chats are the path to pleasure. The Italian boy was infected with a venereal disease, so his father was outraged and sued Xue criminally.</p>
<p>Since the open prevalence of social interactions, and the breaking down of boundaries between men and women, matters that are detrimental to public morals are not only heard of every day, but also emerge in an endless stream. However, in the past, it was only men who seduced women, causing them to engage in immoral behavior. But recently, it has escalated, and there have been cases of women attempting to commit indecent acts and abducting men. What is particularly strange is that the man who was seduced was an uncrowned European boy. This is truly what is meant by the vastness of Shanghai, where there is nothing that is not strange. Although this matter has not yet been widely publicized in society, it has already been involved in litigation. Therefore, the family backgrounds of both parties and the original complaint are recorded as follows:</p>

Her father runs a business in Hong Kong, is skilled in business dealings, and has a reputation for being wealthy. Jinyuan went to school from a young age, so she is proficient in both Chinese and Western literature, and is particularly good at socializing. She had already earned the reputation of a socialite in various ports in Hong Kong and Macau. Later, she came to Shanghai and gained the title of a social star in society. Her sister, Jintuan, is the wife of a certain important figure in the aviation industry. Currently, Jinyuan resides at 111 Jiande Fang, Yuyuan Road, in western Shanghai. The man, on the other hand, is Italian, named Josepb, who is nineteen years old and studying at a Western-run university.

Jinyuan likes dancing, and every night she would invite Mr. You's son, Daishi Fu, to go to the dance hall, and would not return until they were tired. Mr. and Mrs. You initially thought that their son was still young and did not suspect that any impropriety would occur, so they did not prohibit it at all. However, Jinyuan had already identified this blond-haired, blue-eyed child as nothing less than a resurrected Song Yu or a reborn Pan An. After successfully seducing him, they actually lived together. The boy, who knew nothing, fell in love with Xue Jinyuan.</p>

He had to find excuses to go out alone every day, either holding hands with Jinyuan for a walk, or riding in the same car. She originally had a 1707 Baden Austin car, and she could drive herself. Every time the moon was bright and the wind was clear, this pair of lovers would drive through the city and suburbs to enjoy themselves. One snowy night, their car was speeding along, passing Yangshupu in the eastern district. The woman was enjoying the scenery, and in her boundless joy, she wanted her lover to show off his driving skills. However, Yoshio Fu had never learned this skill, but he wanted to win the favor of his beauty, so he risked it. Who knew that he was inexperienced in driving, and a disaster occurred. A Japanese soldier happened to be passing by, and three soldiers were injured. The injured soldiers saw that the driver was an Italian, so they filed a complaint with the Italian Consulate in Shanghai. This case has not yet been concluded. Although You Weiwu had already heard that his son and Jinyuan were in the same car and injured people, he still did not know the whole story. Recently, because his son suddenly suffered from a certain hidden disease, he finally understood everything and was extremely angry. He immediately decided to hire lawyer Yang Ruinian to file a criminal complaint against Xue Jinyuan in the First Special District Court. At the same time, he strictly disciplined his son. However, Xue Jinyuan still did not know that she had been accused. On the 18th of this month, when Yoshio Fu reached the age of eighteen, she specially spent a lot of money to make a set of Western-style clothes and took them to him as a gift, expressing her intention to add to his life. Her affection can be said to be sincere.</p>
<h3 id="e159">The Original Complaint <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>For intending to commit indecent acts and abducting a young man and disrupting the family, I respectfully request your careful examination, prompt detention, and severe punishment according to the law, and reserve the right to private prosecution. I, the plaintiff, work in the shipping industry and have lived in China with my wife and son for twenty-one years. In the spring of that year, when I was living in Macau, the defendant, Xue Jinyuan, was also living there, so we got to know each other and began to associate with each other. Later, I brought my family to Shanghai, and the defendant also moved here. Old acquaintances in a new place, our association became closer. My eldest son, Yoshiou Fu, is not yet seventeen years old. Because of our close association, we became intimate with each other. Social interactions are open, which is the fashion of the times. The principle of not touching between men and women has long been a formality. The ancient country of the East does not even prohibit it, let alone I, the plaintiff, who am a European? Moreover, my eldest son is not yet an adult and is still an Italian citizen. The defendant is already past her prime, and the age difference is significant. I did not suspect anything else. If I were to prohibit their association, wouldn't it be too pedantic? Therefore, I, the plaintiff, did not prohibit it. Who knew that the defendant, a young woman, was careless and had no husband. She climbed over the wall to peep at Song Yu. At times, she would invite him to dance together, and at times, she would go in and out of theaters. I, the plaintiff, thought that singing, dancing, banquets, and outings were common human affairs. However, the defendant used glamorous nightlife as a door to seduction, and secret chats as a path to pleasure. She used the ups and downs of music to move his heartstrings, and the dazzling beauty to fan his flames of desire. How could I have expected this? The boy was ignorant and did not know how to love himself, so he was seduced and committed immoral acts. At first, he still had some scruples, and only returned late at night. Later, he became less and less afraid and dared to stay overnight for several nights. I, the plaintiff, could not forbid him and could not sever the relationship. As a result, Yoshio Fu became dazed and had no intention of studying, and was expelled from school. It is truly lamentable. Recently, Yoshio Fu was infected with a venereal disease, and his strong body has now become emaciated and is on the verge of death. The defendant's actions have not only harmed Yoshio Fu, but also damaged the happiness of the family. She is a scourge to society and a huge villain. Recently, on the 25th of last month, at 11:00 PM on a snowy night, she used her own car, driven by Yoshio Fu, to speed along the Yangshupu Road area. On a deserted suburban night, a man and a woman were in the same car. Such behavior can be used to guess her intentions. Again, she was careless and injured three Japanese soldiers. The injuries were very serious. The Japanese side is about to sue Yoshio Fu in the Italian Consulate. According to Italian civil law and the regulations of the Engineering Bureau, the responsibility for this damage should be borne by the car owner and the licensee. The car owner in this case is a citizen of the Republic of China and has no jurisdiction. Although the case has not yet been concluded, Yoshio Fu will inevitably have to bear the responsibility. I, the plaintiff, am Yoshio Fu's father, so I cannot escape the responsibility of compensating him. All of these losses were caused by the defendant's seduction, so the defendant should be responsible. Therefore, I request that the right to private prosecution be reserved and that the defendant be charged with indecent assault and abduction, which violates Article 257, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. I respectfully request that your honorable court promptly summon her to maintain public morals and uphold the law.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Date of Trial <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>It is now reported that the First Special District Court has scheduled the case for trial at 2:00 PM on the 16th of this month (Thursday) in the Eighth Tribunal. The presiding judge has issued summonses and sent police to notify both the plaintiff and the defendant to appear in court on time to await interrogation. This romantic lawsuit involving the private affairs of men and women is sufficient to break the new record of all romantic cases in Shanghai over the years. It is expected that on the day of the trial, scoundrels, beauties, and other people will leave their homes and go to the courthouse to listen to the trial.</p>

<h3 id="e162">Marriage Issues <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>丨 Letter from Mr. Wang Muchong of Nanjing</p>
<p>I have a question to ask you! I hope you can provide guidance. The fact is this: My life grew up entirely within the feudal power of society, so my marriage was also completely involuntary and arranged by my parents through matchmakers. I remember when I was eight years old, my parents arranged my engagement to a Miss Li from the same village. At that time, I was still young, and of course, there was no talk of autonomy or freedom, resistance or opposition. I only knew how to read the Three Character Classic: "As a child, be filial to your parents," and knew nothing else. When I was studying in middle school, I wanted to express my disagreement with marrying an illiterate person, but because I was not economically independent and could not break away from family ties, arguing with my family would have meant immediately dropping out of school, so I could not get my wish. At the age of seventeen (in 1930), I graduated from a certain provincial middle school in Guizhou. At this time, my parents and elders of the clan were extremely happy to see me return from studying in the provincial capital (Guiyang), so they all came to urge my parents to set a date for my wedding. At this time, I was preparing to go abroad to study and repeatedly refused. However, the "me of the past" was not strong enough to break through that environment, so I temporarily succumbed. As for that Miss Li, she is the daughter of a wealthy man, uneducated and illiterate. My family was not very well-off, but her family was rich. I don't know why her parents insisted on marrying her to me. My parents' minds were just like hers! Feudal! Stubborn! I was extremely unwilling! First, she is illiterate. However, after being forced to marry her, I still continued to study, determined not to change my ambition. Our feelings for each other were ordinary, neither warm nor cold. Later, what I least expected was that she turned out to be a literate country girl. However, she is very gentle in nature and very humble and yielding to me, not arrogant, and she follows my decisions in everything. She is especially respectful to my parents. However, I am still just ordinary towards her because she is illiterate, does not understand human affairs, and does not know the trends of the world. She knows even less about the true meaning of the union of men and women and of marriage. A person like this is no different from a wooden puppet, and originally, it was not a voluntary union. In my opinion, her strengths cannot compensate for her weaknesses. How can this continue? I lived with her for two and a half months. Although there was no complete rupture, there was no deep affection either. From then on, I came to Nanjing, and two years have passed without me ever mentioning her. Now I am hesitating! If I were to divorce her, not only would my family not agree, but she would also be unwilling to leave me! In our area, the future for a woman like that is even more dangerous. If I don't divorce her, I will have to be a husband to a wooden puppet-like person for the rest of my life. Not only is there no happiness to speak of, but I also feel too unfulfilled to have courage! If I teach her to read, she is already older than me by four years, and I am six or seven thousand miles away. What should I do?</p>
<p>Answer: Your letter has been read and understood, and here is my reply: Your wife was not married freely, so naturally, it is unsatisfactory. In addition, she is "illiterate, does not understand human affairs, does not know the trends of the world, and knows even less about the true meaning of the union of men and women and of marriage," which makes you even more disappointed. However, let me say one thing, don't be offended. Illiteracy among women in the interior is a common phenomenon. Of course, girls in schools outside do not have this shortcoming, but it is difficult to say whether they "understand human affairs." In our experience, there are very few truly worldly fashionable women in the city, very few indeed! As for "not knowing the trends of the world, not knowing the true meaning of the union of men and women and of marriage," this shortcoming is by no means unique to your wife but is common among women in general, even among so-called female bachelors and doctors who graduated from universities and foreign countries. I am afraid that it is difficult to find someone who can clearly understand the trends of the world and deeply understand the union of men and women and the true meaning of marriage. Let me ask you a question in return: Have you tried to examine yourself and ask yourself: Do I truly know the trends of the world like the back of my hand? Do I truly have a thorough and complete understanding of the union of men and women and the true meaning of marriage? I am afraid that you would not dare to give an affirmative answer without the slightest hesitation. In that case, it is really too unforgiving to blame others for things that you cannot do yourself, to blame an ignorant and uneducated woman. We do not approve of your unreasonable blame. Our opinion is as follows: (1) Since your wife is very humble and obedient to you and filial to your parents, that is already rare in an old-fashioned woman. If it is because she is illiterate, then persuade her to come out to study. Fortunately, her parents are rich and will definitely be happy to cultivate her. As long as she comes out and experiences more, she will understand human affairs. This is not a problem. (2) We see the problem is still her age. She is a few years older than you. According to ordinary physiology, this is not very suitable; however, it is best if you first ask her to come out to study. When she arrives in a large city, sees more of the world, her knowledge will gradually become different, and her outlook on life will gradually change. Then, the things that you are not satisfied with her may gradually disappear, or at least be greatly reduced, or you may fall in love with her again. If the two of you ultimately cannot find common ground, explain the situation to her face. She will certainly not be as feudal-minded as before and consider divorce to be a disgrace to women. She can find her own suitable lover. You can then get rid of your shackles and "let the bird fly freely" and find your ideal woman! But I must also advise you: Don't set your sights too high. It is impossible to find a woman who is both worldly, knows the trends of the world, and deeply understands the true meaning of marriage. If there were such a woman, you would be satisfied, but I am afraid that you would not necessarily be her ideal man!</p>

<h3 id="e165">Spread of Student Protests in Northern Anhui <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>The Second Rural Normal School Vigorously Opposes Relocation to Suxian; Education Department Sends Personnel to Take Over but are Forced to Leave Bengbu</p>
<p>(Bengbu Correspondence) Zhu Tinghu, the Director of the Anhui Education Department, in order to implement educational cooperation and economize on educational funds, decided to close the Fourth Vocational School of Suxian County, relocate the Bengbu Second Rural Normal School to Suxian, and instruct the Seventh Vocational School here to manage the remaining site for the purpose of adding agricultural sciences. This series of twists and turns has caused many disputes, eventually leading to an uncontrollable student protest. The root cause is that the education authorities were too hasty in their actions. The relocation of the Second Rural Normal School to Suxian was opposed by the teachers and students of the school and local people in northern Anhui. The change of the school principal also led to problems, eventually resulting in events such as refusing the new principal to take over the school. It is understood that the original principal of the Second Rural Normal School, Ma Jingchang, who had studied in the United States, had good qualifications and was highly regarded by all parties. However, when the Education Department recently replaced a large number of secondary school principals, Ma was also among those dismissed and transferred to the province for reassignment. In addition, the fundamental relocation of the school to Suxian was the biggest reason for dissatisfaction among all parties in northern Anhui. Xu Huai, who was transferred to the position of principal of the Second Rural Normal School, was originally the principal of the Third Middle School in Fuyang. After Xu received the transfer order, he came to Bengbu to prepare for the takeover, but then, realizing that the atmosphere was bad and the environment was unfavorable, he quietly left Bengbu and resigned to the Education Department. The Education Department then telegraphed Wei Congxu, a provincial inspector who was staying in Bengbu on official business, to take over the school nearby. However, Wei also felt that the opposition at the school was fierce, and there was a so-called Anhui Northern Education Protection Association supporting them, so it was not appropriate to go there rashly. Even if he went to take over, it would be difficult to do so in practice. He then made an excuse to go elsewhere. Zhu Tinghu, the Director of the Education Department, found that it was impossible to take over the school for the time being, let alone relocate it. Such a long delay would undermine the administrative credibility of the Education Department. After repeated consideration, he sent Yang Xuekai, a provincial inspector from the department, to act as the principal of the Second Rural Normal School and ordered him to take over quickly. After receiving the order, Yang came to Bengbu and stayed at the East Asia Hotel, preparing to implement the takeover. The students of the school heard about it and immediately held an emergency meeting, deciding to oppose the takeover and posting fierce slogans on the streets, making explicit statements. The atmosphere of resistance to the Education Department was extremely high. The members of the Anhui Northern Education Protection Association also expressed their indignation upon hearing this. They first sent a letter to Yang to question him strictly, asking him which school and which person he was representing, and demanding an immediate reply. On the 9th, they met with Yang in full and advised him not to provoke public anger, to return to the province as soon as possible, so as to avoid the expansion of the unrest. Yang did not listen and instead accused the committee members of not interfering in educational administration and opposing the orders of the Education Department, saying that he had to take over this time. The representatives then left in anger. When the students of the Second Rural Normal School heard about it, they gathered a large number of people and went directly to Yang's residence, demanding that Yang not take over the school until the relocation issue was resolved, otherwise, they would ask him to return to the province immediately. Yang initially rebuked the students, but seeing the seriousness of the situation, he knew that it was difficult to stay. He had no choice but to agree to the students' request and was willing to return to the province immediately. He then quietly left Bengbu on the fifth train in the afternoon and returned to the province to report his mission. Since Yang was forced to leave, Wei Congxu, the provincial inspector who was negotiating with various parties in Bengbu, also expressed his indignation at the student unrest and decided to return to the province within days to report everything to the Education Department. According to the latest situation, the students of the Second Rural Normal School have stood in opposition to the Education Department. If the Education Department does not withdraw its decision to relocate to Suxian, this great student unrest may be difficult to resolve for a while.</p>

<p>▲Letters Sent to Various Schools and Institutions to Solicit Listeners</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Education Hall regularly holds academic lectures to explore academic issues. It has been operating for more than half a year. The details of the process are detailed in the first collection of academic lectures. Recently, it has been felt that the mobility of the listeners is limited and it is not easy to obtain a systematic concept. Therefore, a further plan has been made to send letters to various schools and institutions in the city to solicit 200 special listeners, so that they can have the opportunity to supplement their knowledge outside of class. The following methods have been established: 1. The purpose of the hall is to use lectures by various experts to provide for the needs of the general public with more knowledge. 2. The number of special listeners is tentatively set at 200. 3. Special listeners are not limited by age or gender. 4. Special listeners must have a junior high school education or above, and the list of names must be submitted by various schools or institutions to the hall. After review and approval, the hall will issue listening certificates. However, the number of people sent by each school or group must not exceed ten. 5. Those who have a junior high school education or above but are not students or work in institutions may also be special listeners for the hall's academic lectures. However, they must submit a clear resume to the hall for review and approval, and a listening certificate will be issued. 6. The hall's academic lectures are held once every two weeks. The date and topic of the lecture will be published in the education news section of major newspapers in the city one week before the lecture. 7. Special listeners are entitled to the following rights: (1) When the hall holds academic lectures, they may enter with their special listening certificate. (2) They may submit written inquiries about various issues related to academic lectures. (3) They have the right to suggest that the hall hire a certain lecturer.

(2) If they are absent without reason three times, the hall may reclaim the listening certificate and replace it with a candidate. 10. These methods may be revised at any time.</p>
<h3 id="e174">The Municipal Education Bureau Sends Personnel to Investigate the Organizational Status of Various Primary Schools <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>▲Additional Classes Will Be Added After the Investigation is Completed</p>
<p>After the start of the second semester of the 21st academic year, the number of students in municipal primary schools in various districts has increased sharply, and they have successively requested the addition of classes. The Municipal Education Bureau of this city believes that it is necessary to open up more classrooms since the classrooms in various schools cannot accommodate them, but it is necessary to first understand whether the organization is completely appropriate and how many students there are in order to approve them.

<p>The Hearts of the People in Hongkou Park Are Greatly Rejoiced</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Jinan Football Team suddenly showed signs of revival and defeated Lax 4-0 in Hongkou Park. This was one scene of the Group A competition. The weather was sunny and more than 2,000 people watched the game. Jinan took the offensive throughout the game and had many opportunities, but unfortunately missed many of them. Lax was a mess and no longer had its former power. Referee Zhang Le. The lines of both sides are as follows:</p>

<p>Lax got the right to kick off, and Jinan advanced against the wind, which was quite difficult. However, the entire army worked hard and took the lead everywhere. Lax's line of battle was shaky from time to time. Jinan attacked three times and all reached the enemy's gate, but it was a pity that they lost the opportunity due to inaccurate shooting. The first time, Yun Fengdi passed the ball to the center, Liang got it and sent it forward, Luo Haiguang sent it to the right corner, Zhong Yongsen returned it to the front of the goal, but he didn't shoot it in. The second time, Gu Shangxiang passed to Liang Shutang, Wang Nanzhen took it on the left wing and went straight in, Luo Haiguang received this steady ball in front of the goal, but he didn't shoot it in. The third time, Wang Nanzhen passed to Luo Haiguang, Fu Heyi took it and went up, but he retired due to offside, which was a pity for everyone.</p>

<p>Jinan launched a fierce attack again and again, but failed to achieve its goal. However, it did not relax at all and persisted. Thirty minutes after the start of the game, the enemy's gate was captured. Yun Fengdi shot a long shot from the center line, which reached the right corner. Zhong Yongsen received the ball and passed it to Zhang Hongzao, who passed it to the center again. Luo Haiguang could not miss at this point. Since the victory and defeat were already decided, the morale was even more boosted. Yun Fengdi once shot a long shot at the enemy's goal, which happened to fall into the hands of the enemy's goalkeeper. Jiang Shanjing, who was defending in the rear, also stepped forward and launched an attack. The momentum of Jinan can be seen from this. In the first half, Jinan 1, Lax 0.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Triple Crown in Ten Minutes <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>In the third minute of the second half, Jinan lost a scoring opportunity. Luo Haiguang received the ball from Zhong Yongsen, rushed to the goal, and shot hard, but it bounced off the goalkeeper's leg and back to the right. Unfortunately, Zhong Yongsen was assisting in the center at this time, otherwise, he could have easily scored. Losing in the east, gaining in the west, in the next ten minutes, Jinan actually scored three times. Wang Nanzhen shot from the left corner, and Robert Ziz received it in his hand. Before he could throw it out, Zhang Hongzao rushed up, the goalkeeper fell, and the ball went in, adding one goal to make it 2-0. Turning around, Wang Nanzhen went up again, the enemy defense was broken again, and Wang, Zhang, and Luo, the three generals, broke through the enemy's goal side by side, making it 3-0. Laks' misfortunes never come singly. Forbes touched the ball with his hand, and Luo Haiguang's soft penalty kick was saved by Robert Ziz but leaked in, making it 4-0. The situation was largely settled. Later, Luo Haiguang was injured, went out and came back in. Laks also futilely lost opportunities. Both sides exchanged attacks, and the game ended 4-0.</p>

<p>Jinan's victory over Laks was due to the entire team's efforts. Everyone worked hard and deserves praise. The strength of the defense made the enemy retreat, unable to cross the line. Therefore, the forwards were able to attack at will, both bravely and quickly, which was remarkable. It is a pity that their shooting was inaccurate, and they did not shoot when they had the ball, otherwise, it would have been even more impressive. Laks' heroic spirit was gone, and they did not know what to do.</p>

<p>▲ German Sports Association Has Already Prepared for the Games</p>
<p>(Berlin Correspondence) German Chancellor Hitler once expressed opposition to Germany hosting the next World Games, his reason being that Germany's economic situation made it inconvenient to waste money on this again, and the platform of the National Socialist Party (i.e., the current ruling party) also opposed competitive sports and supported mass sports. Unexpectedly, after this proposal was made, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini announced that if Germany was willing to abandon the next World Games, he would be willing to accept the next Games to be held in Rome. Therefore, German public opinion was in an uproar, and the general public criticized Hitler's dictatorship. The opposition to competitive sports by the National Socialist Party has gradually subsided. The president of the German Sports Association, Lewald, in order to urge the national sports community to pay attention to the next Games, has recently been actively preparing for the affairs and often convenes meetings of the entire preparatory committee to achieve the best possible results for the next Games. The Games has now created a logo and distributed it to various countries for publicity.</p>

<p>Losing 0-2 to Lancashire, hitting the goal post twice without scoring</p>
<p>In yesterday's Western League First Division football match, the Youyou football team lost to Lancashire, which was unexpected by the more than 2,000 spectators at Yiyuan. The reasons for this are: 1. The forwards lacked coordination; 2. There was little individual creativity; 3. The inside and outside were divided into two parts. The defense was well-organized. Ye Jinmian and Wang Shusen were particularly outstanding. Goalkeeper Liang Guanlian had both strengths and weaknesses. Lancashire's 2-0 victory was due to the team's coordinated offense and defense, with no special performances. The referee was Helms. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Lancashire</p>
<p>Wilson</p>

<p>Youyou advanced towards the Japanese, but was blocked halfway, and they exchanged attacks for several minutes. Sun Jinshun tried a shot first, which went wide by more than a foot. The enemies came from all directions, and Qian Yaobin bravely resisted. Before long, they advanced into the heart of the territory, and Shi Jinsheng rescued them in time. Afterwards, the atmosphere became relaxed, and the two sides seemed to enter a time of peace for ten minutes. Lancashire's left-winger Wilson invaded alone and sent the ball in front of the goal. Goalkeeper Liang hit it out with both hands, and the left side continued to attack, but he still caught it. Therefore, the morale was boosted, and the forwards advanced fiercely. First, Xi Qiaosheng tried a bicycle kick, and then Li Shuoyou passed the ball in the middle. The three central generals advanced at the same time and fought fiercely for a long time, but it was difficult to score. The first half ended, and both goals remained intact.</p>

<p>Two minutes into the second half, Shi Jinsheng was accidentally careless, which set off a prairie fire. One foot missed, and Wilson seized the opportunity to enter, and turned to the front of the goal, centre forward Lauton shot and broke the gate, four to spread the bad news. Spectators were greatly shaken, Youyou went on the five road and divide the attack, each to the centre line is ineffective, at twenty-five minutes, Chen Guangyao greeted a ball, delivered to the centre, Li Shuoyou from left to centre, without thinking, suddenly attack the door, those guarding jumped up to block it, the ball bounced backward, touched the post, after again several back and forth, Youyou left and right corresponding, Sun Jinshun iron leg shot out, hitting the post, two times could have scored but failed to, but was Centerford front a roof, and was lost, it can be described as unfortunate to the most, as a result, Lancashire won by two to zero.</p>

<p>Yesterday coincided with Sunday, also the anniversary of the death of Sun Yat-sen, the weather was fair. Russian women living in Shanghai also thought of contacting the Chinese in Shanghai to learn from each other. Yesterday was Sunday, and they specially invited the Women's Minli Team, which is famous in Shanghai volleyball, to play a friendly match. At 10:15, they arrived at the Minli Stadium in the southern city and began to compete. They adopted the American-style volleyball league method of the Western Youth Association, with six players on each team. Minli had never played this system of competition before. The method was novel and very interesting. As a result, Minli won 44-38. The referee was Chen Yuehe, the instructor of Haixing. The team members and results of both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>Women's Minli - Dai Zuling, Huang Yunzhu, Tan Taijun, Liu Xiuyun, Zhang Xiangping, He Cuizhu, Le Xingjuan.</p>

Its ball skills and outstanding talents have long been known to the people of Shanghai. However, they seemed unaccustomed to yesterday's system, so they lost the first game. They then had smooth sailing and were very interested. In the end, they won two games in a row, winning 39-27. The team members and results are listed below:</p>

<p>The rise of a word, the origin of a term, must have its source, and its process of development. Xu Shu Chong's description of the "Shuo Wen Jie Zi" says, "The word means to give birth and multiply and tilt more." Since it is said to give birth and multiply, each has its source. Since it is said to tilt more, it is said to increase. Is this only true of Chinese characters? In general, science has specialized scientific terms. The development of science is new every day and different every month, the breeding of terms, self-layered and endless, in this to the vast scientific terms, what will be the art to manage it? I have devoted myself to medicine for nearly 20 years, and I am always troubled by the complexity of terms and the difficulty of memorizing them. I thought about it and thought about it, thinking that I am not the only one who suffers from this. I then made up my mind to investigate and explore its roots, so that in the midst of grasping the main points, I could imply the meaning of simplifying the complex, for the convenience of my classmates and colleagues. Thus, this compilation was made. When studying the origin of European medical terms, there are Greek and Latin origins, of which 70% originate from Greek and 30% originate from Latin (anatomical terms mostly originate from Latin, while other medical terms mostly come from Greek). The structure of terms is divided into single words and compound words, with single words accounting for 30% and compound words accounting for 70%. Compound words have roots, prefixes, and suffixes. The meaning of the name varies depending on whether it comes from the prefix, suffix, or the connection between the prefix and suffix. Knowing its roots, prefixes, and suffixes makes the meaning of the whole word clear. This compilation is based on this, so it is divided into two parts, prefix and suffix (word roots and prefixes are prefixes, word roots and suffixes are suffixes), and all compound medical terms are classified within the prefix and suffix parts. Several examples are given as illustrations, with attached translations for reference. My humble intention is not to dare to boast of innovation, but to believe that reading Hua's books is based on literacy, and translating books is based on translating words. A word has a true meaning, and losing it by a hair's breadth can lead to a difference of a thousand miles. If one understands the origin from which it comes, it is like Yang Youji shooting fleas, without missing an ounce. Using it to read books will not be vague, and using it to translate can be accurate. New words are added every day, and scholars who check dictionaries often suffer from incompleteness. If they do not understand the key to literacy and beg for help from incomplete dictionaries, how can they have the joy of solving problems easily and having everything at their fingertips? Moreover, words are created by people, and the structure and meaning of the created words may not be consistent. Holding this secret key as a standard can not only examine and correct the original text, but also create new words, and is it only limited to literacy and translation? In recent years, the translation community in China has been very divided on scientific terms. The reason for the errors lies in the lack of clarity of the true meaning, and especially in the lack of knowledge of the origin of the words. Therefore, I have compiled this compilation, not considering my shallowness, so that scholars can follow this method to treat all scientific terms, and perhaps achieve twice the result with half the effort, and achieve the effect of unifying translation names. Its influence may not be limited to medical terms.</p>

<h3 id="e199">The Period of "No Solution" <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Baihe</p>
<p>—Dawn Still Awaits—</p>
<p>In the past, Europe had a "Dark Ages" and a "Renaissance," both of which were very important in history. But in this era, this world of unknown depths has stepped into a "no solution" period of 120% severity. Everyone scratched their heads and ears, and finally racked their brains, but there was no solution.</p>
<p>The old gentleman of the League of Nations, with the eyebrows and eyes of a gentleman, kept saying that Japan should spit out the Northeast and retreat its troops into the railway zone. Japan did not follow the order. What is the solution? Country A was afraid that Country B would have a powerful military and be threatened, so it very cleverly launched arms reduction. But people are not fools. You say arms reduction, I say equal armament. Using your spear to attack your shield, what is the solution? Due to the increasing severity of the unemployment problem, it is inevitable that there is a danger of economic revolution. Everyone finds economic revolution terrifying, but the unemployment problem cannot be solved after all. What is the solution? No one wants to cause a world war, because everyone has tasted the taste of the European War and feels that the matter of bloodshed is ultimately painful. But you want to seize my rights, I want to break your lifeline, red eyebrows facing green eyes, and insist on not taking the path of world war. What is the solution? Killing someone pays with your life, owing money pays it back. This is a matter of course and inescapable. But the debtor keeps delaying with tears and snot, intending to deny the debt. What is the solution? Under the oppression of imperialism, the colonies gradually see through the paper tiger of imperialism, resist with great sacrifices, and rise up in resistance. When the imperialists' poison gas cannons cannot suppress the revolutionary sentiments, what is the solution for the imperialists?</p>
<p>The modern recession has enveloped the entire world. We Chinese really have no solution. Countries around the world are also clamoring for no solution. "The long night is long, and dawn still awaits." This "no solution" period is probably not easy to get through.</p>
<h3 id="e200">"Entertainment" and "Saving the Nation" <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Ke Ding'an</p>
<p>Our China, every time after going through a national crisis,</p>
<p>, it is as if we have had an injection, temporarily excited, but ultimately silent. Since the recent September 18th Incident, the effect of that injection has been relatively long, but the sons of wealthy families who are drunk in the sounds and colors of horses and dogs are still like this, but they also learn from the enthusiastic people and say:</p>
<p>"Entertainment saves the nation"!</p>
<p>If entertainment can really save the nation, then "eating" and "sleeping" can also save the nation. What a bizarre saying!</p>
<p>Based on the principle of entertainment saving the nation, General ××, when his homeland was full of artillery fire, still wanted to indulge in singing and musical rhythms in the old city. This is putting "entertainment saving the nation" into practice!</p>
<p>"Can't entertainment really save the nation?" Someone asked me this. I said:</p>
<p>"Entertainment can also save the nation, but you have to change the way a little bit to suit the original meaning of entertainment saving the nation. If you have friends coming, you want to invite them to see a play. According to the most ordinary expenses, two people would have to spend three yuan. You should donate these three yuan. At the same time, you can explain to your friends that I was originally going to invite you to see a play today, but because I was moved by patriotism, I would rather take the three yuan to donate to the Northeast. I think you and I are equally patriotic and will certainly agree."</p>
<p>I think "a heart of patriotism, something everyone possesses"! If you say this to your friend, your friend doesn't need to say anything, he will definitely agree, and he will admire you very much!</p>
<p>There are so many entertainment venues in Shanghai, such as Beijing opera houses, movie theaters, amusement parks, massage parlors, ballrooms, book stalls, and other secret places that I can't name or call. If we Chinese can all do it in my way, "using hot blood and heat" (Note), the result is really not something that can be described in a few words. When this method can be implemented, it will be the day when the Republic of China will turn over.</p>
<p>Isn't it time for "aviation saving the nation"? If the Chinese in Shanghai can implement my method of "entertainment saving the nation", then the success of "aviation saving the nation" is not far away.</p>
<p>Note: Hot blood and heat cannot be separated, so I use them together.</p>
<h3 id="e201">The Relativity of Beauty <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— A Tang</p>
<p>"Beauty" is relative, not absolute. Humans, and it can be said that various animals, have different aesthetic concepts due to various relationships.</p>
<p>Chickens, dogs, and pheasants on the mountain, in the eyes of humans, the males are certainly more beautiful than the females, but in the world of living things, repulsion between the same sex and attraction between different sexes is a certain principle. Therefore, in the minds of male chickens, dogs, and pheasants themselves, the females are probably not as ugly as humans feel. Otherwise, why would the males pursue the females? Would you pursue an ugly woman in your mind?</p>
<p>The indigenous women of Africa, in the eyes of civilized humans, are of course extremely ugly; but in the perceptions of the indigenous people of Africa, they must be very beautiful.</p>
<p>Old gentlemen in their sixties and seventies, when they see modern women, some will shake their heads and sigh, saying! "Now the world is really getting worse, the young girls are dressed up in an unseemly way." This is because of the physiological decline of the elderly; second, because the trends of their youth are different, so their aesthetic concepts are also different from those of young people now. I think when they were young, they were also passionately pursuing women with bound feet and morbid beauty.</p>
<p>Without climbing high mountains, you cannot see flat ground. What you have always considered to be the most beautiful will definitely be diminished in value after you discover something even more beautiful, and this has caused a lot of fluctuations in the world.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is no fixed standard for the so-called "beauty" in the world.</p>
<h3 id="e202">It's Difficult to Please Everyone <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhihen</p>
<p>"Mr. Wu! The term exam next Tuesday, please make the questions easier, and please point out the scope." As soon as Mr. Wu entered the classroom, as usual, he called the roll, and a student stood up and said.</p>
<p>"The weather is so cold now, Mr.! Look at the snow outside the window, it's nearly a foot deep. People are sitting around the stove, and they are still calling out that they are cold. We are sitting in the cold self-study room, with more than a dozen subjects, each with at least thirty or forty pages, all to be tested next week. Now we are turning the pages one by one, and our hands are already frozen. If we have to memorize everything in our heads, wouldn't that be killing us? Mr.! Fortunately, your history class is not important. Please do a good deed and point out a scope." This student continued to say, without waiting for Mr. Wu to answer.</p>
<p>Two contradictory impressions floated in Mr. Li's mind:</p>
<p>丨丨The day before yesterday, at the school affairs meeting, Principal Jiang said very seriously: "Now the education department is very serious about examining the students' coursework in various schools. Recently, there has been a notice saying that it is absolutely not allowed to point out the scope for each exam. Please pay close attention to this point and do not allow any flexibility.丨丨</p>
<p>丨丨During the summer exam last school year, the first-year students asked Mr. Lu to point out the scope. The stubborn Mr. Lu absolutely refused. As a result, sixteen out of thirty-five students in the entire class failed, which aroused a student riot throughout the school. They falsely accused Mr. Lu, saying that the class taught by Mr. Lu was completely incomprehensible. From then on, the entire class stopped attending Mr. Lu's class. Principal Jiang was Mr. Lu's classmate, but he couldn't help him either. As a result, Mr. Lu packed his bags and returned home.丨丨</p>

<p>Chapter 1 Warm Invitation to Poor Girl to Enter the House; Generous Farewell Shows Martial Spirit</p>
<p>When Company Commander Zhao looked at him, with long eyebrows, big eyes, and an oval face, almost two-thirds of which was covered with rouge, a layer of bangs covering the forehead, and a long black braid trailing behind, a long cheongsam dragging over flat green shoes and white socks. Just these few points vividly showed that she was a traditional girl of the Banner people. Zhao Ziqiang knew that the Banner people were very particular about rules and regulations, and it was not appropriate to talk too much to the inner room or to a young girl, so he nodded and said: You don't have to be polite. I just talked to your old lady, and after my father moves in, everything will need your care. I can't come home often, and even when I come home, I have to leave after a while. The old girl saw that although he was a rough-browed and big-eyed black man, with a round face, he also had a bit of honesty. She took a step back, lowered her head and smiled, saying; You are too polite. Zhao Ziqiang also turned his body aside and walked out the door sideways. Jiang talked to him a few words and saw that he was polite. This impression was even better, and she sent him all the way to the gate. Zhao Ziqiang stood there and stopped her from sending him off. He smiled and said: Tomorrow morning, my father will move here from the city. If I don't make it, please take care of him a little with me, old lady. My father is already sixty-eight years old this year. Although he is still healthy in spirit, he is still a few years old. I'm always afraid that there will be some inconveniences. Jiang said: Since we are neighbors, we will always take care of each other. You can rest assured. Zhao Ziqiang smiled and walked out of the gate, then stood up and gave her a salute before turning back to mount his horse. Just as he was mounting his horse, a car came very fiercely and撞ed into the horse. The horse was already startled, and then its body flickered. Zhao Ziqiang was a person who had just mounted his horse and was not yet seated in the saddle. This flicker made him flash forward and fall straight onto the stone steps by the gate. The car driver saw that he had caused trouble and wanted to escape, but a group of camels was slowly coming towards him, blocking the way, so he had to stop the car. Zhao Ziqiang jumped up, stood by the car, and grabbed the driver's car husband and said: Come down, I have something to say to you. The car husband looked at this appearance and guessed that it would be too hard to get away, so he had to follow him down. (10)</p>
<h3 id="e204">National Crisis and Women <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Ju Yun</p>
<p>The pass has fallen! The invaders are deep in our territory! A great war is about to break out! But among women, there will be no shortage of Hua Mulan, who joined the army in place of her father, and Qin Liangyu, who loyally defended the emperor and suppressed the bandits. Perhaps we have seen on stage and in historical novels: "Riding a peach blossom horse, wielding a nine-dragon blade, the female general is awe-inspiring, taking the lead, fighting the bandits for hundreds of rounds."</p>
<p>Even now, we see many! Female military officers, wearing high leather boots, full military uniform, and armed belts, are just as heroic and high-spirited; their gun barrels aim at the enemy's vital point, "one person guarding the pass, ten thousand cannot pass." Kill one for every one that comes, even if the Japanese devils could escape to the heavens!</p>
<p>Although only a small portion of women can do this, haven't the majority of sisters and aunts in cities and villages had equally important roles and tasks: "Rearguard work"?</p>
<p>During the last European war, European women were able to endure hardship and did many great and amazing things:</p>
<p>They rescued wounded soldiers brought back from the front lines and supplied food and weapons to the brave warriors at the front; in order to maintain the safety of local municipalities, they organized well-equipped female police forces and female defense corps: the financial and commercial sectors, which could not be abandoned at any time, all needed women in "agriculture," "industry," and "commerce."</p>
<p>The abilities of Chinese women are no less than those of others. Why shouldn't we be as good as European women? Then we might as well close our eyes and think for a moment. It seems that every woman will carry a heavy burden from now on!</p>
<p>But looking back at some of the sisters in the cities, they are still only concerned with dressing up beautifully, watching movies, playing mahjong, and wasting some boring time, without ever thinking that the enemy has already entered the door of our house!</p>
<p>Or perhaps the sisters in the Pingjin area have already felt deep terror, hurriedly fleeing south, seeking temporary safety.</p>
<p>Only those who are in the southern provinces or have arrived in the southern provinces think they can relax and be carefree for a while, leading a carefree and happy life; they have made no preparations, and they have no awareness!</p>
<p>We still cannot forget the ruins left by the January 28th Incident in Shanghai!</p>
<p>Everyone has already learned about the violent and heinous acts of the Japanese bandits.</p>
<p>Is it really necessary for the enemy to kill us before our eyes before we wake up? I don't think women are that stupid!</p>
<p>I know very well that if there is a thief, he doesn't even need to carry any weapons, at most a bright, sharp knife. If he visits the home of any sister, nine out of ten will only be frightened and tremble, without any idea of what to do.</p>
<p>In fact, terror and shrinking back are of no use! Naturally, if you have made sufficient preparations for everything, you will not be flustered in an emergency.</p>
<p>The practical exercises and efforts needed now are a matter of "life and death," and there is no room for further hesitation or delay.</p>
<p>We have also seen that many "women's associations," which represent women's groups, have already started working, and they are also proposing to raise funds to purchase a "Women's Plane" to realize the current popular idea of saving the country through aviation.</p>
<p>According to the calculation of 200 million female compatriots, it seems that buying a plane does not take much effort. On average, even if each person donates one cent, two million can be raised. Thirteen or fourteen planes would be easy to obtain, and each woman only needs to save three copper coins.</p>
<p>Then the modern ladies can buy one less cosmetic, buy one less new outfit, watch one less movie, and get their hair permed one less time. The Buddhist wives can take out half of the incense offered before the Buddha, and the family can eat less meat for a few days, which is equally meritorious. Sisters who make a living by sewing can work a little harder for half a night and save some national salvation savings. Those with good reputations can stop for a while. If you can donate all the money you planned to use for gambling, you might save a lot of money, at least enough to avoid owing a dollar here and a few cents there.</p>
<p>When you are free, you can be free, but when "national crisis is at hand" and "the pain cuts deep," people in the same boat should no longer have a life of leisure and complacency!</p>

<p>— Pang Jingzhou</p>
<p>Chapter 4: Business Conditions</p>
<p>(Note) The Shanghai Public Hospital in the Nanshi area, mentioned in the previous article, used to admit epidemic patients during the epidemic period. However, the new building for the epidemic department of the hospital has now been completed, and the equipment has been greatly improved, so it can now accept patients with major infectious diseases all year round. In addition, the Zhabei Public Hospital has also been rebuilt and improved after the war. These two news are good news for the citizens of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the individual businesses in the new medical community. We have already said that the total number of new doctors in Shanghai is not considered small when compared to the number of people. However, because people in society tend to favor traditional Chinese medicine, the business of each new doctor is not very developed on average. It is natural that competition in business forces them to use some business tactics. Business tactics are nothing more than catering to the psychology of society. If we say that expressing harmony, kindness, and friendliness in the words and actions of responding to patients does not shake the status and academic knowledge of the doctor, it is also the attitude that every practicing doctor in the world should take. However, in China, it is sometimes very difficult to be harmonious. For example, if a patient hires both a new and old doctor and asks the new doctor to consider the prescription of the old doctor, asking whether he should take it or not? Or ask if there are any disadvantages to taking both Chinese and Western medicine at the same time? This kind of question really makes it impossible for the new doctor to answer. The most honest and non-deceptive answer is the word "I don't know." As a result, the patient complains that the new doctor is uneducated and has no responsible answer. Under such difficult circumstances, new doctors with great reputations often abandon the patient and use "please hire someone more skilled" as a way out, but his colleagues who criticize him can also accuse him of "irresponsibility" or "becoming like a traditional doctor," but I have carefully considered this situation and decided that it is by no means something that either the doctor or the patient can create. As for the lower-level business tactics, it is inevitable that they will be speculative. For example, whichever disease is most common in society, that disease is used as a topic to attract business. Like Shanghai today, it is a city with difficult living conditions and a decadent atmosphere, so there are many people suffering from venereal diseases and neurasthenia. As a result, the signs for brain and sexual disease clinics spring up like mushrooms after rain, and frustrated businessmen and absurd young people flock to them. Lung disease is a major enemy of the whole world, especially in big cities, so there are many in Shanghai. It is really as funny as brain and sexual diseases for non-experts to call themselves lung disease experts. In my opinion, Shanghai has special epidemics in all seasons, so doctors with a little bit of a thick skin might as well become experts who change with the seasons: in spring, they are called diphtheria and scarlet fever experts; in April and May, they are called measles and pediatric experts; in summer, they are called cholera and diarrhea experts; and in autumn, they are called dysentery and malaria experts; it is not impossible! The new medical association recently decided to restrict the advertisements of formal doctors and not allow them to falsely claim subjects. Even if they are real experts, they must meet the standard of having a major in this field in the medical academic system, which is a very proper method. Practicing doctors can be roughly divided into two categories: one is the one who rules all subjects; the other is the specialist. Specialists are naturally in the minority, and those who rule all subjects naturally account for the majority. In theory, all general practitioners should introduce the patient to a specialist for treatment due to academic and equipment reasons when encountering difficult and complicated symptoms. However, in Shanghai today, it has not yet reached this level. Except for a small number of people with great knowledge and great assets who seek medical treatment from experts, others only seek medical treatment from general practitioners. Because their business is not very developed, general practitioners may not be able to give up business and introduce serious illnesses to experts one by one. (According to regulations, formal doctors must pass all subjects before they are allowed to practice. Minor illnesses in all subjects can be treated.) Moreover, is Shanghai's experts in all subjects complete? Is it good or not? It is still a question, so it is actually difficult to do, and the patient's knowledge and economic strength, whether they can all be treated by experts? It also matters. The three things I have personally experienced can be used as proof of this statement: (1) Once I accidentally relieved the considerable pain of a hemorrhoid patient, he introduced many hemorrhoid patients, thinking that I was a hemorrhoid expert. In fact, hemorrhoids alone are not listed as a specialty, and I am not a hemorrhoid expert, but as a result, I gained considerable experience, and a part of the most difficult patients were still introduced to other places; (2) Once, a patient's family hired an old doctor to treat malaria, but they insisted on asking me to introduce a Western doctor who specializes in treating malaria. There is no specialty for malaria consultations, so I had to introduce an internist to them in a harmonious way; (3) A patient's wife insisted on a foreign female doctor to perform an ultra-superior abdominal surgery, saying that it seemed indecent for a man to perform the surgery, so I had to decline by saying "there is no such thing in Shanghai." (End of this chapter)</p>
<h3 id="e207">On Phlegm, Part 4 <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Yunxiu</p>
<p>Then, is it impossible to understand the old medical theory of phlegm disease? I say, analyze it! The way to analyze it is to first rectify the names. If the names are rectified, then all diseases can be classified according to their types, so that they will not be wandering souls without a home, living together in a mixed manner. Now, let's temporarily define those that are viscous and sticky as phlegm and those that are clear and thin as drink, according to the old medical terms of modern times. Then, what the old doctors call phlegm is the mucus that today's scientific medicine calls mucus. There are two places in the human body that produce mucus: one is the epithelial cells, and the other is the connective tissue. Those produced by epithelial cells are called epithelial cell mucus, and those produced by connective tissue are called connective tissue mucus. Epithelial cell mucus is produced from mucous membranes and mucous glands. The human body's skin has mucous membranes and mucous glands that can secrete mucus, such as the mouth, nose, throat, trachea, esophagus, stomach, intestines, urethra, cervix, and the Eustachian tube in the ear. Connective tissue mucus is in the joint membrane, synovial bursa, tendon sheath, and the umbilical cord of the fetus, and the subcutaneous tissue in the early stages of fetal life is also mucus.</p>
<p>Within the scope of physiology, there are places with mucous membranes and mucous glands that often secrete a small amount of mucus, such as the small intestine and cervix. There are also those that never secrete mucus, such as the nose and trachea. When there is disease, those that secrete a small amount become a large amount, such as the stool during dysentery and the cervical leukorrhea. Those that do not secrete become secretory, such as nasal mucus and turbid saliva. There are also places without mucus cells that cannot produce mucus, but become producing liquid mucus, such as mucus cancer. Therefore, in pathology, any place that does not secrete mucus but secretes mucus, and any place that secretes a small amount but secretes a large amount, can be called "mucus degeneration." Then, in a broad sense, all diseases of mucus degeneration can be called phlegm diseases. The most obvious ones are various mucositis, such as nasal catarrh, pharyngeal catarrh, tracheal, bronchial, esophageal, gastric, intestinal, urethral, and cervical catarrh, all are phlegm diseases. The causes of inflammation of the mucous membranes in various places are various chemical and physical stimuli, and various bacteria, such as influenza bacteria, diphtheria bacteria, tuberculosis, syphilis, gonococcus, cholera bacteria, and dysentery bacteria. It is not caused by the seven emotions, six excesses, overwork, or diet.</p>
<p>In addition, mucus edema, mucus tumor, and various mucus mixed tumors, mucus cancer, and ovarian cystic tumors are also all phlegm diseases.</p>
<p>In addition, the mucus temporarily secreted in the trachea and esophagus during acute neurological disorders, such as stroke and epilepsy, and that produced during heart failure, is considered by old doctors to be wind-phlegm and shock-phlegm. However, these secretions are mostly serous and belong to drink diseases, which are closer. Calling them phlegm diseases is not really relevant. Moreover, these secretions are produced after stroke and epilepsy, not because there is phlegm first and then the disease develops.</p>
<p>The above are what I call phlegm in a broad sense. As for the phlegm that the world calls cough phlegm, etc., it refers specifically to the mucus secreted in the respiratory organs, which the ancients called turbid saliva and saliva. I call it phlegm in a narrow sense.</p>
<p>However, whether it is phlegm in a broad sense or phlegm in a narrow sense, the essence of the disease is in different places and does not belong to the same category. The causes of the disease are also in different places and do not belong to the same category. The common phenomenon is that mucus is produced. Mucus is produced after there is disease. It is a product of the disease, not the main body of the disease. Therefore, today's science, although it knows that several diseases can produce mucus, there is no possibility and necessity to establish a special "mucus disease" name. This can be understood from the above. However, the name "phlegm disease" of old doctors is very unreasonable, and those who organize the national heritage should cut it out and discard it.</p>
<p>As for the symptoms caused by phlegm, in nasal mucositis, there are headaches, nasal congestion, and speech sounds like in a jar. However, whether the headache of nasal catarrh is meningeal congestion or serous inflammation is still an unresolved issue. In short, it is the influence of mucositis, not the influence of the mucus it secretes. In ear Eustachian tube inflammation, there is hearing loss, in trachea and bronchitis, there is cough, asthma, and shortness of breath, in the pharynx, there is nausea, in the stomach, there is bloating and loss of appetite, in the intestines, there is diarrhea, in the anterior yin, there is gonorrhea and leukorrhea and prostatic leakage, in the joints, there is joint swelling and pain, and in the subcutaneous tissue, there is mucus edema. Various symptoms are also in different places and do not belong to the same category. They should all be classified under various diseases, so that the analysis is clear and there is no danger of confusion. Do not establish a "phlegm disease" category and collect all the mucus</p>
<h3 id="e208">The Advantages and Disadvantages of Consulting a Doctor by Mail <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>In order to eliminate the difficulty for patients in the inland to have no doctor when they are sick and to solve the difficulty for poor patients to have no ability to seek medical treatment when they are sick, various new and old pharmaceutical publications have specially opened a column for medical and pharmaceutical consultation to give patients the convenience of consulting a doctor by mail. Especially the medical and pharmaceutical supplements in various daily newspapers.</p>
<p>In addition to the above two simple opinions, there are two important meanings: (1) to widely publicize medical and pharmaceutical knowledge in order to achieve the popularization of medical and pharmaceutical knowledge; (2) to publicly study difficult and complicated issues.</p>
<p>This cannot be regarded as a gospel for mankind! But after careful investigation, how much dangerous nature is contained in this gospel of mankind. Now, from the perspective of medical treatment and prescription itself, there are the following two questions.</p>
<p>Aren't we eliminating the difficulty for patients in the inland to have no doctor when they are sick and solving the difficulty for poor patients to have no ability to seek medical treatment when they are sick? But when we open the newspaper, are all those who ask for medical treatment from the inland and poor? This really gives patients a cunning and stingy opportunity to not seek medical treatment when they are sick! The patient thinks that a piece of empty paper can get a therapeutic solution, and a very limited number of postage stamps can exchange for the safety of his life and the disappearance of pain. Is there such a cheap thing in the world? Since there are not completely no doctors in the inland and those who ask for medical treatment are not completely poor, with such a cheap opportunity for patients, the practicing doctors in the inland are invisibly suffering a major loss, and the editors of our faithful medical and pharmaceutical publications are also invisibly being used by cunning patients!</p>
<p>Doctors have a great responsibility to patients. No matter how big or small the disease is, doctors must go through precise on-site examinations before they can have accurate diagnoses and prescriptions. Therefore, diagnosing diseases cannot be based entirely on the patient's verbal reports. As for what is written on paper, it is even less reliable! In this kind of unpredictable disease condition, giving a therapeutic answer based on a letter from the patient is, of course, that the patient's report is not completely consistent with the disease condition, even if it is completely consistent, and in this kind of question and answer back and forth, the disease condition may have undergone special changes. The patient does not know that there is danger, is the doctor not "loving it, but actually harming it"?</p>
<p>There is nothing in the world that has only advantages and no disadvantages, so consulting a doctor by mail is not absolutely impossible. What I hope for from the editors of medical and pharmaceutical publications is that they should take an extremely cautious attitude towards consulting a doctor by mail, so that the results obtained will not deviate from the original intention of benefiting mankind. In particular, there must be transparent observation so as not to be obscured by the patient and to harm the rights and interests of colleagues in the inland.</p>
<p>As for using this as a tool for personal publicity or selling foreign medicine, it is even less worth mentioning.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Inflammation and all the symptoms of mucus degeneration, mixed and listed. As for the symptoms of neurasthenia, hysteria, etc. that have nothing to do with mucus, such as palpitations, fear of being caught, tinnitus, wind sounds behind the brain, etc., as well as the symptoms of bronchial secretions produced by stroke and epilepsy, etc., should not belong to phlegm, let alone be said to be caused by phlegm. They can be eliminated.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about the nature of mucus. Mucus is a homogeneous, transparent, viscous liquid with traction. It can swell greatly when added to water. It dissolves in alkaline liquid. When acetic acid or alcohol is added to its solution, it precipitates like clouds. It is red when stained with Thionin and Muzinkramin. Its chemical essence is characterized by containing mucin. Mucin is a glycoprotein, which is a combination of protein and carbohydrates. Then, phlegm is a product of the body with special chemical properties. It is not made by accumulation of water and drink or stagnation of body fluids. It is clear.</p>

<p>— Yu Songyun</p>
<p>(C) The Second Stage of Childbirth... Expulsion Stage</p>
<p>The labor pains in the second stage of childbirth are called labor pains in the expulsion stage. During this stage, the cervix has fully dilated, the amniotic sac has ruptured, and the baby's head has entered the vagina. Afterwards, the labor pains are specifically for expelling the fetus. At this time, the labor pains are severe and frequent, and last very long, often inducing reflexive abdominal pressure to help the baby's head advance.</p>
<p>During labor pains, the baby's head descends, and when the pain stops, it retreats. At that time, the perineum extends, the anus gapes open, and the rectal wall everts. Not only is there a bowel movement, but also stool leaks out, so that the labor pains become more severe and the perineum becomes more distended, presenting a spherical shape. A part of the baby's head opens the labia, and when the labor pains stop slightly, the baby's head retreats backwards, and the labia (cleft) closes again. The stronger the labor pains, the more the baby's head advances, so that the vulva is unusually tense. At this time, the pregnant woman is in severe pain, and her efforts become even greater. Suddenly, her face turns red, her eyes are bright, her lips are red-purple and dry, her pulse is frequent, and there are fine arterial pulsations on the tips of her fingers, which shows the tension of the whole body's exertion. At the same time, the whole body sweats. When the labor pains come again, the whole body trembles. At this time, even during the intervals of labor pains, the baby's head no longer retreats. It immediately appears outside the vulva, commonly known as the time when the top of the head is exposed. The tension of the external genitalia has reached its extreme, and the pregnant woman cannot bear the pain, shouting non-stop, and even losing consciousness. The baby's head is expelled at this time, or after two or three more labor pains, it can be completely produced. The fetus announces its birth in a cry.</p>
<p>(D) The Third Stage of Childbirth... Afterbirth Stage</p>
<p>After the fetus is born, the placenta and amniotic membrane are expelled after twenty or thirty minutes, or at the same time. However, when the placenta is expelled, afterbirth labor pains occur, specifically to make the uterus contract and squeeze out the placenta, presenting a spherical shape. Then, the childbirth ends from here.</p>
<p>▲ Reply to those who request abortion</p>
<p>Recently, I have received letters requesting abortion. It must happen several times a month. Although the reasons given are nothing more than physical weakness and inability to bear the burden of childbirth, I don't know that abortion is not only full of dangers, not less than a miscarriage, but also violates the criminal law. We doctors take humanitarianism as the foundation. Not only do I absolutely not allow myself to perform abortions for others, but I often warn society to avoid the dangers of abortion. If anyone disregards the danger and rashly aborts, it will violate the criminal law, destroy life, and cause the greatest harm. The criminal law of our country has repeatedly emphasized the punishment for abortion, but those who intend to try it still treat it as a dead letter. Here are the main points:</p>
<p>(1) A pregnant woman who takes medicine or uses other methods to abort shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than one year, detention, or a fine of not more than 300 yuan. The same shall apply to a pregnant woman who listens to others to abort. (Section 304)</p>
<p>(2) Anyone who causes a pregnant woman to abort at the request of the pregnant woman or with her consent shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than two years. Anyone who causes the death of the woman as a result shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than five years. (Section 305)</p>
<p>(3) Anyone who commits the crime in the first paragraph of the preceding article with the intention of making a profit shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than six months and not more than five years and may be fined not more than 500 yuan. (Section 306)</p>
<p>(4) Anyone who publicly introduces methods or items for abortion or publicly introduces their own or others' behavior of abortion in writing, pictures, or other methods shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than one year, detention, and may be fined or converted to a fine of not more than 1,000 yuan. (Section 308)</p>
<p>The above is just a brief reply. I will not reply to each letter in the future. I hope you understand. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e211">A Brief Discussion on Asthma <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Hou Guangdi</p>
<p>Asthma, known in the West as Asthma. The Greek word means "I am struck." The most prominent symptom of this condition is difficulty breathing, accompanied by a peculiar wheezing sound.  The onset usually occurs around two in the morning.  The patient suddenly wakes up, unable to breathe without propping themselves up with pillows. The wheezing gradually worsens, reaching a point where it seems as if they are on the verge of suffocation. Then, suddenly, they improve. Those who have suffered from this condition for a long time are accustomed to these alarming symptoms and are not greatly frightened. The onset of this condition is intermittent, but the intervals vary. Some cases are preceded by colds, bronchitis, or indigestion.</p>
<p>Mild asthma only involves difficulty breathing.  Severe cases involve cold limbs, profuse sweating, and vomiting.  After two or three hours, the condition gradually eases, and the patient coughs up sticky phlegm, finally returning to normal. At this point, the patient is extremely tired and falls into a peaceful sleep. The next day, the illness seems to have disappeared. However, most patients often suffer from bronchitis with coughing and excessive phlegm, and some suffer from indigestion.</p>
<p>Those who suffer from gout and are prone to eczema often also suffer from asthma. The two conditions often alternate. Excessive stomach acid, restlessness, and indigestion are common ailments associated with asthma. Syphilis and malaria can also commonly contribute to the suffering of asthma.</p>
<p>The cause of asthma is a matter of debate. Some attribute it to the blood, others to nervous system disorders. However, judging from the symptoms, it is clear that during an asthma attack, the constrictive center of the brain nerves triggers a constrictive action, causing the muscles around the bronchi to contract. The reason why the constrictive center acts in this way must be due to impurities in the blood.</p>
<p>In addition to these, there are various external causes, such as changes in air, dust, contact with flower pollen, the smell of birds and animals, the oily smells of cooking in the kitchen, and the spraying of perfume, all of which can trigger asthma. From this, it can be inferred that improper food is certainly one of the triggers. Therefore, those who have suffered from asthma for a long time can often identify certain unsuitable foods and avoid them to prevent the onset of the condition.</p>
<p>About 40% of cases of this condition are hereditary.</p>
<p>Treatment is divided into two types: radical and emergency. Radical treatment requires examining the patient for other underlying causes, such as syphilis, glandular disease, malaria, gout, diabetes, etc., and treating them to free the brain nerves from stimulation. Nasal fungus in the nasal cavity and throat moths in the throat are also causes of this condition and must be removed. For emergency treatment, the best option is to inject ephedrine or a combination of Atropine sulfate and morphine, or alternate injections of adrenaline. Burning Datura leaves soaked in saltpeter into black smoke and inhaling it often produces remarkable results.</p>
<p>Ephedrine is made from domestically produced ephedra. It has a special effect in treating asthma. It is available for injection and oral administration in various regions. Foreign pharmaceutical companies such as Moufu, Parke Davis, Eli Lilly, and Merck all produce it. The product manufactured by the New Asia factory is also very fine and has a faster effect. I have used it extensively and have never been disappointed. I highly recommend it to the people of our country.</p>
<h3 id="e212">A Visit to Hangzhou Minsheng Pharmaceutical Factory <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Xiaomei</p>
<p>With the atmosphere of aggression intensifying daily and the national crisis deepening, at this critical juncture of survival, how can we find time for national salvation, let alone industry and resistance?  However, Mr. Zhou Shiluo, at this time, did not forget industry in saving the nation. He worked tirelessly, day and night, sparing no effort, using his knowledge to establish the Minsheng Pharmaceutical Factory in Hangzhou, engaging in the manufacture of medicines, medical equipment, and glassware.</p>
<p>On the eve of the lunar New Year, I was invited by Mr. Lu Zhixue and Mr. Wu Guanmin to visit the factory. I had the opportunity to see Mr. Zhou's demeanor. I found Mr. Zhou to be kind and approachable.  He guided us and explained everything in detail. What impressed us most was that the layout of the factory and the design of the equipment were all Mr. Zhou's own creations. For example, the furnace, stove, and chimney required for the steam boiler, and the structure of the gate, all utilized scientific principles to save fuel.  For the filling of ampoules with liquid medicine, the principle of the air pump was used, allowing one thousand to one thousand plus ampoules to be filled per hour.  Hangzhou has no gas, so kerosene lamps were used, with a hole in the middle and air blown in, the flame size can be adjusted as desired, the effect is like a Bunsen burner.  Other examples include the use of a ball bladder to replace a bellows to pump air.  Examples like these are too numerous to mention.</p>
<p>The factory is divided into three departments: the chemical pharmaceutical department, the medical equipment department, and the glassware department. It employs many experts to specialize in manufacturing. The following is a summary of the general situation of the factory:</p>
<p>(1) Chemical Pharmaceutical Department</p>
<p>Although the department does not have large-scale equipment, the machinery used in manufacturing is quite complete. Such as automatic tablet machines, mixing machines, pill machines, sugar coating machines, polishing machines, ointment grinding machines, etc., all of which are self-made. The injection medicine room is equipped with steam throughout, with vacuum distillation equipment, vacuum washing equipment, and ampoule filling equipment (made by Mr. Zhou). Male and female workers are trained, and all operations are well organized. The department has recently manufactured a new drug called Pityol to counter the foreign-made Pityrol. It will be displayed at the Chicago World's Fair.</p>
<p>(2) Medical Equipment Department</p>
<p>Because the workers in this department all went home for the New Year at the end of the lunar year, I was unable to visit, which is a great regret.</p>
<p>(3) Glassware Department</p>
<p>This department is equipped with a furnace, a vacuum pump, and an air storage tank. It specializes in manufacturing neutral hard glass, such as various sizes of ampoules, cowpox tubes, serum bottles, test tubes, injection tubes, measuring cups, medicine bottles, safety funnels, beakers, mortars, funnels, conical funnels, flasks, round-bottom flasks, etc. Although there are larger glass bottle factories at sea, the quality of their products cannot be compared to the excellence of this factory, this can be stated with certainty.</p>
<p>In addition, the most famous products of the factory include: Trypalin, Vertodin, Antihustin, Pityol, Oxytin, Gimenor, Salpalin, Plolnichin, Quinoblau, Fiberung, Digitolin, Magnol, and hundreds of others. I can hardly imagine how much effort Mr. Zhou has put into them! Mr. Zhou has recently been working hard to make further progress, striving for perfection. His diligent and hardworking professional attitude cannot be described in words. Mr. Zhou can be said to be a person with the will to save the country through industry!</p>

<p>In the past, when science was underdeveloped and medicine could not yet use scientific methods for research and experimentation, it was of course difficult to distinguish right from wrong and truth from falsehood. One could only guess and tell lies. In the modern era of advanced science, medicine has been able to use scientific methods for research and experimentation. Therefore, it is undoubtedly necessary to abandon the false and erroneous old medicine and apply the correct and reasonable scientific new medicine. However, the general public, having been subjected to past inherited propaganda for a long time, does not understand the errors and falsehoods of old medicine and unconsciously believes that these erroneous and false old medical theories are correct and reasonable. The unawakened old doctors, on the other hand, are unwilling to recognize the times, admit the backwardness of old medicine, and refuse to submit to the truth and admit the falsehood of old medicine. Instead, they actively propagate and spread rumors about these false pseudo-medical theories to society: running newspapers, running colleges, and organizing groups to carry out reactionary movements. On the one hand, the public is easily anesthetized and deceived by the lies of old medicine because of the inherited ideas left over from thousands of years in the past. On the other hand, old doctors take advantage of the weakness of the public's naive thinking and inherited minds to further exert their ability to deceive the masses. In fact, the result of this reactionary work is only to lead the public into a misguided path that is detrimental to health. Therefore, for the health of the public and the future of the country and the nation, we should shoulder the revolutionary work of opposing old medicine, analyze the falsehoods and fallacies of old medicine, explain them to the public, propagate them to the people, and change their past metaphysical minds and the errors of inherited thinking. It is necessary for the majority of the public to feel awakened to the errors of old medicine in the past in order to develop faith in scientific new medicine. Metaphysical minds and inherited thoughts will definitely not be able to accommodate the knowledge of scientific new medicine! It is even more difficult to correct the habit of spitting phlegm everywhere for a tuberculosis patient who does not believe that there are countless tuberculosis bacteria that can infect each other hidden in the phlegm. Our propaganda work of instilling medical knowledge into the public is for the purpose of improving the public's health. If we want the public to be able to accept and enjoy the benefits of this medical knowledge, we cannot avoid doing some destructive work against old medicine. The nature and significance of this revolutionary work of destroying old medicine is no less important than the two tasks mentioned above: saving the public from suffering and instilling medical knowledge! This major task, which is related to the future of the country, should not only be the task of a few new medical personnel, but the task of every new medical personnel, the task of all doctors in the new medical community!

<h3 id="e214">What Will the Future Hold for the Gold Standard? (Part 1) <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Shihao</p>
<p>▲ A Major Transformation Since 1816</p>
<p>The gold standard for currency truly began in England in 1816, after which various countries followed suit. Due to its fixed production and stable value, it was deemed the most suitable medium of exchange. In modern times, with the increasing convenience of transportation, the economic relationships between countries have become closely intertwined. The smooth functioning of international lending and settlements is largely due to the stability of the gold standard in various countries. When the European War broke out in 1914, many participating countries suspended the gold standard, but only regarded it as an emergency measure during wartime. Therefore, after the peace treaty was concluded, they restored it one after another. People generally regarded the gold standard as a canal for connecting international economies and even considered it the supreme standard for currency.</p>
<p>In 1929, a panic occurred on the New York stock market, followed by a global economic depression. Although the United States quickly achieved temporary stability, the remaining countries remained trapped in a panic from which they could not extricate themselves. Due to domestic economic difficulties and the breakdown of international coordination, the instability of the gold standard, such as the suspension of gold coin convertibility and the restriction or prohibition of gold exports, became a common practice in the past three or four years. The wave even affected other hard currency standards, which also experienced suspensions. According to statistics, there are a total of seventy-four major standard currencies worldwide. At the beginning of this year, only nine maintained a hard currency standard, of which six were on the gold standard: the United States, the Union of South Africa, France, Switzerland, Danzig, and the Netherlands. Three were on the silver standard: China, Persia, and Hong Kong. Recently, the gold standard in the United States has, in fact, been suspended. Although the Washington government has declared that it will maintain the gold standard, gold coin convertibility has already been suspended, and gold exports have been prohibited. Even if one wants to say it has not been suspended, it is impossible. Currently, France, the Netherlands, and others have increased their gold reserves. Optimists believe that the world's fragile gold standard can still be restored, but considering the future of the world economy, its peril is difficult to express. This is truly a major transformation unseen since 1816.</p>
<p>▲ The Flight and Hoarding of Gold</p>
<p>Many commentators attribute the instability of the gold standard to the flight and hoarding of gold. The world's currency in cash was 10,244 million (US dollars) at the end of 1925, 11,052 million at the end of 1928, and 12,078 million at the end of June 1922. The increase rate is indeed not large. Compared to the total volume of global trade at the time, it was insufficient to maintain the original reserve ratio. Among them, the amount held in the United States was 4,399 million at the end of 1925, 4,141 million at the end of 1928, and 4,956 million in June 1931. The amount held in France was 978 million at the end of 1925, 1,271 million at the end of 1928, and 2,212 million in June 1931. The gold reserves of the United States and France increased from about 50% of the world's total to about 60%. This was due to the repatriation of war debts, reparations, and short-term capital from various countries. After the second half of 1931, the United States saw a decrease, while France saw a sharp increase. The majority of the world's gold reserves remained in the hands of these two countries. It is estimated that at the end of 1932, the United States held about 4,500 million dollars, while France exceeded 8.3 million francs. In addition, most other countries experienced a decrease. Japan decreased from 541 million dollars (US dollars) at the end of 1928 to 424 million in June 1931, and even further decreased at the end of 1932, with only 425 million yen. Germany decreased from 676 million dollars (US dollars) at the end of 1928 to 359 million in June 1931, and even further decreased in 1932, with only 79 million marks. The United Kingdom remained relatively stable, but the amount was not large, with 814 million dollars (US dollars) at the end of 1925, 836 million at the end of 1928, 865 million at the end of June 1931, and 110 million pounds at the end of 1932. From a general perspective, it is undeniable that gold fled to countries such as the United States and France, while Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom inevitably paled in comparison. The situation was even worse for other countries. The gold standard is based on cash as the main currency. Domestic exchange relies on it, and international clearing also relies on it. This is what is meant by the so-called "canal for connecting international economies." Now, a small number of countries hold huge amounts of gold, while the reserves of most countries are dwindling. How can the gold standard of these majority countries be maintained? At a time when the world's gold production is declining, there is also a flight of gold, which is truly a misfortune for the gold standard.</p>
<p>It is already alarming that international gold reserves are not evenly distributed but form a pattern of flight. However, it would still be acceptable if this fleeing gold flowed into useful channels. Unfortunately, those who receive this gold mostly hoard it, thus further reducing its effectiveness and further endangering the foundation of the gold standard. According to statistics, since 1928, the gold reserve ratio of the United States and France has consistently exceeded their paper currency circulation. The gold reserve ratio of the twelve Federal Reserve Banks in the United States was 61.5% of the Federal Reserve notes and deposits at the end of 1928, 69.6% at the end of 1929, and even exceeded 70% in 1930. It gradually decreased afterward, but still reached 61.9% at the end of 1931. The gold reserve ratio of the Bank of France was 79.9% of the banknotes and deposits at the end of 1928 and 80.9% at the end of 1931. The former exceeded the legal reserve ratio by about one-third, while the latter exceeded the legal reserve ratio by more than one time. Therefore, in the United States and France, there is a lot of gold that is hoarded, and social credit does not become active due to the increase in gold. The currency on the market also does not increase due to the abundance of gold reserves. In other words, the currency under their gold standard does not expand or contract with the actual gold reserves. The effectiveness of the gold standard is thus limited. As for other countries, since their gold has already fled, the credit and currency that have historically been based on the gold standard will inevitably develop flaws, gradually leading to a global financial crunch, falling prices, and economic panic. This has been the case for the past three or four years. Commentators often attribute the instability of the gold standard to the flight and hoarding of gold, and there is good reason for this.</p>
<p>▲ Is the Global Economic Panic a Cause or an Effect?</p>
<p>Based on the previous discussion, the instability of the gold standard seems to be due to the flight and hoarding of gold. But is the global economic panic a cause or an effect? This is something that must be discussed. Some say that under the credit system of the gold standard, the expansion and contraction of credit are measured by gold reserves. In recent years, gold has experienced flight and hoarding, and most countries have seen a decrease in gold reserves. With less gold, credit tightens, finance becomes congested, prices fall, and economic panic arises. Albert Tanssen, Reginald Mant, Henry Strakosch, and others all advocate this view. They believe that countries must repay war debts and reparations to the United States and France, leading to a trend of gold flight. After 1928, the United States and France not only did not release funds to other countries but also recovered other debts, further unevenly distributing global gold. The world economy inevitably fell into panic. The report of the League of Nations Gold Committee elaborates on this. This view considers the instability of the gold standard to be the cause of the global economic panic. Others say that since the end of the European War, the economic policies of various countries have undergone a new transformation. The international division of labor before the war has gradually been abandoned, and national capitalism has increasingly risen. Those who preside over a country's economic policies initially strive for self-sufficiency in their own country's raw materials and products, imposing various restrictions on imports. Subsequently, they also strive to dump goods abroad, seeking the prosperity of their own country's industries. Therefore, the production equipment of various countries has expanded, fixed capital has increased, and protective tariffs have been pursued, becoming even more intense in recent years. According to a report from the US Department of Commerce, European countries generally raised tax rates more than six times in the single year of 1930, and Latin American countries generally raised tax rates a total of five times. Gradually, high barriers were erected between countries, and what began as mutual dumping ended in mutual stagnation. International trade greatly declined. Here is a list of the trade of forty-eight countries around the world in the first half of each year (unit: million marks):</p>
<p>1928 1931 1932</p>
<p>Imports 64.1 41.6 27.5</p>
<p>Exports 57.1 36.1 23.7</p>
<p>Total 121.2 77.8 51.2</p>
<p>With the decline of international trade and the obstruction of foreign sales channels, the production equipment of various countries has also become idle assets, and skilled workers have lost their jobs one after another. Economic panic has become a widespread phenomenon. Debtor countries, lacking new international loans to offset their debts to creditor countries such as the United States and France, have no choice but to transport cash, leading to the flight of gold and the eventual collapse of the gold standard. This view considers economic panic to be the cause and the instability of the gold standard to be the effect.</p>
<p>The above two views have completely different causal concepts, and the latter view is more reasonable. Since a fierce tariff war has occurred between various countries, the world economy has lost its interconnectivity. Moreover, the production equipment within each country has been excessively expanded, and the government lacks the ability to implement "controlled economy." Although individual factories and companies have become more scientific and rational, the entire country has become more unscientific and irrational. Under this type of economic organization, how can panic be avoided? Since the signs of a global economic panic have already appeared, currency and finance should naturally be unstable. Moreover, with the recent unevenness of international lending and the flight of gold, the instability of the gold standard is naturally a common cash flow.</p>
<p>▲ The United States Reaps What It Sows</p>
<p>The United States was originally a debtor country. Although its land is vast and its resources are abundant, it did not have much influence in global finance. After the European War, its position changed dramatically. Its foreign claims increased daily, and the power of the gold dollar kingdom shook the globe. Wall Street's replacement of Lombard Street as the center of world finance has lasted for nearly twenty years. In the past four or five years, its massive gold reserves have been even more alarming. Since last year, a tendency of decreasing reserves has begun to appear. If it could make good use of its position to promote the interconnection of the world economy, it might not be without promise. Unfortunately, it has adopted a policy of exploitation toward various countries, while simultaneously increasing protective tariffs and expanding production equipment, fearing to fall behind. As a result, the world economy has declined, exports have sharply decreased, and its domestic market has first experienced a crunch. In the past year, it has even seen an outflow of cash, causing increasing tremors in the hearts of its people and forming the recent panic. Although its gold reserves are still large, panic has already arisen, and people's hearts are wavering, which cannot be calmed by these reserves. Its gold standard has had to be suspended. To put it bluntly, it can be said to have reaped what it sowed. Some say that one of the causes of the US panic is the failure to recover war debts as scheduled. This statement is not unreasonable. However, even if war debts were recovered as scheduled, it would only be enough to form the current surplus. With other countries becoming increasingly impoverished due to debt repayment, the global economic panic would inevitably deepen, US foreign trade would inevitably become more sluggish, and its production capital would inevitably become more idle. Even if it wanted to avoid panic, could it? The eventual instability of its gold standard is both a matter of reason and necessity. Moreover, in recent years, the rise in gold prices seems on the surface to be caused by the flight of gold, but in reality, there are two other reasons: (1) The hoarding of gold. The United States and France hold the most gold but use it the least. In other words, they are most unwilling to rely on gold reserves to expand their credit and promote the activity of currency and finance. The United States did not consider issuing government paper money until the recent panic. If this measure had been taken earlier, the bank's gold reserves would inevitably have decreased due to circulation in the market, but the current panic might have been alleviated. (2) The artificial raising of prices. The United States, with the most gold reserves, would purchase gold whenever gold prices fell, fearing that it would be detrimental to itself. Therefore, a large amount of gold has been collected in the United States. Unexpectedly, holding a lot of gold would lead to idle capital and the eventual occurrence of panic. The recent instability of its gold standard can be said to be reaping what it sowed. The United States now seems to be using a policy of monetary inflation as the backbone of its relief efforts. This is a commonly used method in economic history, but it can only be effective for a short time. Without other effective reorganization methods following it, we ultimately do not believe it is reliable. In this autumn of global economic gloom, can the US panic be stabilized immediately? Can its gold standard ultimately avoid instability? Gazing at the Statue of Liberty, one cannot help but feel pessimistic.</p>
<p>▲ What About France?</p>
<p>The United States and France are the two major gold countries of today. The United States has unfortunately experienced a breakdown, while France has managed to maintain its solid reputation. This can be said to be a highlight for the gold standard. However, there are still two facts that must be explored: (1) The global economic downturn has been prolonged since 1929. With the various barriers between countries, a recovery is difficult to achieve immediately. France's foreign trade, like that of other countries, has declined. Its domestic productivity has also declined. However, the degree of decline is relatively mild. If the industrial production index in 1928 was 100, then the United States was 74.8 in June 1931 and 54.1 in August 1932, while France was 99.2 in June 1931 and 73.2 in August 1932. France is also an industrialized country, with a fairly large-scale production equipment. Given its past downward trend and the current state of the world economy, the outlook for its domestic economy is not optimistic. (2) France's gold reserve ratio to currency circulation is even higher than that of the United States. The expansion of the gold reserve ratio is not inherently a bad phenomenon, but hoarding too much without knowing how to use it is inevitably uneconomical. If it does not use this to expand credit and promote the smooth operation of the world economy, it may not be a blessing for France. The famous French economist Charles Rist once said that the lack of credit expansion is due to the economic downturn, so that banks cannot expand credit even if they want to. This statement has considerable truth. When the economy is depressed, industries are in decline, and banks, for the sake of prudence, find it even more difficult to grant loans. However, in fact, it is only difficult, and the number of those who need funds for reorganization is not small. Considering the increase in the reserve funds of major British banks and the decrease in loans before the panic in the United Kingdom in 1895, one cannot help but worry about France.</p>
<p>In summary, in this tide of global panic, whether the French economy can remain stable and whether its gold standard can avoid instability depends on the actions of various countries. If international coordination cannot be achieved and countries cannot implement controlled economic management, then the world economy will be difficult to recover, and France will not be optimistic. Even if France can maintain its gold standard, the global instability of the gold standard is undoubtedly certain. However, based on the current phenomenon, France's cash reserves are increasing, which may be a good temporary phenomenon for its local situation.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Causes of the American Financial Crisis <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Mao Zhenchu</p>
<p>This sudden American financial crisis is like a violent storm descending from the sky, the reason for which is unknown. However, if we analyze the recent domestic economic, social, and political phenomena in the United States, we can understand that the occurrence of this crisis has its own inevitable result.</p>
<p>(1) (Invalidation of Debt) Originally, the prosperity of the United States was a gift of fortune during the European war. Before the war, the United States was the world's largest debtor nation. After the war, it took advantage of the lack of production capacity in various countries to develop its export trade as much as possible. Tracing back to 1915 (the year after the start of the Great War), its foreign trade volume had jumped from 1.4 billion yuan to 2.8 billion yuan, exactly doubling. The following year, as the European war was in full swing, the United States exported large quantities of food and munitions to Europe, further jumping to 5 billion yuan, almost doubling again. In 1920 (two years after the armistice), European countries were still unable to produce due to their devastation. At this time, the total value of US foreign trade reached a record high of 8.2 billion yuan. During these six years, so much money flowed into the United States from foreign countries that it goes without saying that it transformed from poverty to prosperity. However, after this, on the one hand, European cash gradually dried up, and all transactions with the United States could only be done with "debt claims" besides cash. On the other hand, their production capacity also gradually recovered, and US export trade gradually decreased accordingly. The US revenue from foreign money became increasingly scarce. Even if there was any revenue, it was nothing more than debt claims on paper. At the same time, the debt directly issued by the United States to countries such as Britain and France due to the war amounted to more than 10 billion yuan. The repayment of this war debt entirely depended on whether Germany could fulfill its indemnity obligations to Britain and France. Currently, Germany is unable to pay its reparations, which affects the credit of Britain and France in repaying the US war debt, creating a chain of deadlock. The ultimate victim is the United States, which holds the world's debt claims. Therefore, strictly speaking, the prosperity of the United States had already shown a hollow phenomenon since 1921. Its prosperity was built on debt claims, and when debts could not be recovered, the national finance would inevitably fall into a state of financial difficulties. In 1929, there was a stock market boom. It is no wonder that four years later, today, a panic finally occurred due to the lack of settlement of debt claims.</p>
<p>(2) (Financial Deficits) The amount of annual expenditure in the United States' finances was only around one billion before the war, but it jumped to more than four billion after the war. Of the three billion increase, about one-third was the cost of bearing the national debt. During the Great War, the United States' war expenses consumed more than 44 billion yuan, most of which came from issuing national debt. In 1919, the highest amount of national debt could be as much as 25.5 billion yuan. Repaying the principal and interest annually was naturally difficult. In terms of revenue, customs duties accounted for about 600 million yuan, and other sources were income tax, etc. However, the taxes on tobacco, alcohol, and wine, which were the main sources of revenue before the war, underwent complete changes after the war. In particular, the alcohol tax was drastically reduced by about 40 million after the implementation of prohibition. Income tax, etc., also decreased abnormally. At the same time, military spending in 1926 was still 16%, but in 1930, it expanded to 20%. Last year's fiscal year (1931 fiscal year) military expenditure budget was as high as 814,274,000 yuan. It can be seen that in the United States' finances, the tax revenue on the income side has a tendency to decrease sharply year by year, while the huge national debt expenses and military expenditures borne on the expenditure side increase every year. Therefore, since 1931, there has been a state of being stretched thin. In recent years, the most important topic of each parliamentary session has been how to fill the financial deficit. The imbalance between the revenue and expenditure of the national treasury inevitably reduces the credibility of the bonds issued by the country, directly affecting the financial sector, which uses bonds as reserves.</p>
<p>(3) (Trade Depression) Since the European war, the foreign trade of the United States can be roughly divided into three periods. From 1915 to 1921, it can be said to be the golden age; from 1922 to 1929, it was the period of decline; and from 1930 to 1932, it was the period of depression. Its golden age was actually due to the lack of products caused by the European war, and its decline was also due to the fact that European countries were able to produce on their own, and exports decreased accordingly. As for the phenomenon of depression since 1930, it was entirely affected by the world panic. According to statistics, the United States' foreign trade in the past three years has decreased by about one-third compared with 1929. However, 1929 had already entered a period of decline. Therefore, all those with knowledge are worried about it. Some even say that if this state is maintained for a long time, by September 1933, the United States' foreign trade will be completely eliminated. Although this is somewhat of an exaggeration, the degree of this depression can be imagined. The increase or decrease of US foreign trade is closely related to commissions, profits, and employment issues. It is said that at least 2.4 million families in the United States depend on foreign trade for a living. Now, all countries are attacked by the "recession," and they are all competing to protect their domestic markets, either by raising tax rates or implementing "allocation systems" (i.e., separately limiting the import quota of each country) to restrict imports, causing US trade to be completely defeated. How can American foreign traders who depend on this for a living not fall into a difficult situation, and also affect the national economy as a whole?</p>
<p>(4) (Production Deterioration) The industrial production volume of various industrial countries affected by the world recession has naturally declined. According to the German Economic Research Institute, the world industrial production index last year, except for Soviet Russia, India, and Japan, has all retreated to the same level as before the war, which is rare in the past decade. Even if 1913 is taken as 100, last year it was 101. Among them, Germany, the United States, and Poland are particularly severe, and the production in the United States is becoming increasingly worse. The industrial sector of the United States has long been shrinking at any time due to the world recession and the sharp decline in trade. Naturally, there is no longer any concern about overproduction. However, the depression of general industries directly affects the losses of various enterprises and the financial difficulties of the financial sector. At the same time, American agriculture has always been known as developed, and wheat, the main component of agricultural products, is also the main commodity for export. Last year, the total US grain production was more than 304 million bushels, but due to the depression of exports, there was a sudden surplus of grain, and the prices of all food products fell sharply. If 1929 is taken as 100, the price of wheat last year was only 56.5, and other products such as corn were only 66.8. The sharp drop in food prices will inevitably bankrupt the entire rural economy, and agricultural panic will occur. According to statistics, the total debt of farmers across the country is about 20 billion yuan, a staggering figure. The severity of the rural panic has reached this extreme. From this point of view, the United States is under dual pressure in terms of production: 1. Sharp decline in industrial production; 2. Overproduction of agricultural products. These two contradictory phenomena shake the entire economic organization, and the financial panic is inevitable.</p>
<p>(5) (Soaring Unemployment) The so-called world panic actually started with the increasing number of unemployed people. In the past, the world regarded the United States as a wealthy nation, but who knew that in recent years, the surge of unemployment has swept across the United States. In January of this year, William Green, president of the American Federation of Labor, declared, "The number of unemployed people in the United States has reached a peak of 11.6 million. After three years of economic and financial panic in the United States, there is no way out for the unemployed." Moreover, according to Newton Baker, chairman of the Public Welfare and Relief Movement Committee, at the end of last December, perhaps a quarter of the people had no income at all and relied on their relatives, friends, and social unemployment funds for their livelihoods. The reasons for unemployment are the sharp decline in industrial production and the overproduction of agricultural products, which can all lead to mass layoffs. Therefore, the number of unemployed people in the United States is the highest in the world, more than double that of Germany, which ranks second with 5 million. Since unemployment is an important factor in promoting panic, the indirect increase in the panic in the forty-eight states by 10 million unemployed people is within our imagination.</p>
<p>The various tragic scenes mentioned above surround the entire American financial sector day and night. The maturity of the conditions for the financial crisis has been waiting to happen. The arrow is on the string, and it will be triggered at any moment. Before today, it was like a machine with all the components in place, but lacking fuel to drive it. And today, the fuel is ready. The so-called fuel is the dishonored withdrawal of 7.5 million yuan in deposits from the Ford Motor Company to the Detroit Union Trust Company, the transition of new and old presidents in politics, the outflow of cash from the banking sector overseas to repay short-term foreign debts, and the sharp drop in stock prices. The recent decline in the US stock market is more severe than in September last year. Railway stocks have decreased by about 39%, and industrial stocks have also decreased by 35%. Since stocks have a close relationship with the banking sector, the sharp decline in stocks has naturally caused the banks' lending and credit to be shaken. The general public is even more aware that the political situation is in a period of transition between new and old presidents, and they all suspect that the new president's ascent to the throne may change important systems such as finance and currency, causing psychological anxiety. Therefore, when they heard the rumor that Ford's withdrawal was dishonored, they took the opportunity to withdraw deposits from banks. And when the banks were in a state of cash emptiness, they caused this huge wave. Some say that Ford Company and the outgoing President Hoover had a considerable relationship, and the withdrawal may have had a political effect. But they did not realize that this kind of behavior harmed others without benefiting oneself, and they would not do this. However, the impact of political changes on people's psychology directly promoted the financial crisis, which is an undeniable fact. Moreover, the rapid promotion of this financial crisis is not without defects in the system of the banks themselves. The US banks are independent systems and do not have branches. The 18,000 major banks in the country are independent and do not support each other. Therefore, when a financial crisis occurs, they often lose their turnover capacity. Unlike banks in the UK, etc., which adopt a branch system, they can use the power of branches in various places to transfer and operate each other, and they will not be forced to close down at every turn.</p>
<h3 id="e216">England After Abandoning the Gold Standard <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Chu Tiao</p>
<p>Since the German financial panic broke out on May 12, 1931, shaking the foundations of credit in the British Isles, it has triggered a wave of capital flight from Germany and the repatriation of investments in England by other countries. This intensified the abnormal movement of international gold, forcing England to abandon the gold standard on September 21, 1931, and legally restrict foreign exchange on the 23rd.</p>
<p>However, it has been more than a year and four months since the abandonment of the gold standard. To what extent has it affected the British economy? In fact, the effects on British industry have been minimal, and have not even achieved the results that the British expected. For example, the price of the gold pound fell 10% in the two months after the abandonment. Furthermore, the bold increase in interest rates in the London financial market created an "unprecedented" phenomenon since 1897. However, this unnatural high interest rate was nothing more than the Bank of England trying to prevent inflation and desperately restricting the outflow of money, which led to the fact that the amount of paper currency in circulation could not increase as before. At the same time, as a result of rising prices, a huge amount of capital was needed. In other words, the result of abandoning the gold standard was that it was necessary to increase capital, and at the same time, because of fear of inflation, interest rates had to be raised.</p>
<p>Regarding the cost of living for the people, according to a survey by the British government's Ministry of Labour, it has not been expensive since September, when the gold standard was abandoned. On the contrary, wholesale prices have risen by more than 10% during this period. Furthermore, it is not only raw materials, but also domestic and foreign goods. Furthermore, the wholesale prices of domestic food and raw materials also rose by an average of 5% to 10% in the two months after the abandonment. In addition, the rate of increase in the price of imported raw materials is not much different from that of domestic products. Retail prices have not risen because the general wages and rents at that time were the same as before and had not increased.</p>
<p>In addition, due to the impact of the fall in the gold pound, the prices of its exports were also 20% lower than before. However, it is still doubtful whether the UK can regain the market it lost after the European war due to the fall in the gold pound and prices.</p>
<p>In fact, although the total amount of British foreign trade has made slight progress since the abandonment of the gold standard, the amount is still very small. Imports have only increased slightly due to seasonal factors or increased tariffs, but the increase in exports is very small. Let's look at the following table to understand.</p>
<p>British Trade Volume with Prohibition of Gold Exports in 1931</p>
<p>Imports　　　Exports　　　Trade Deficit</p>
<p>August　　　　　65.3　　　33.0　　　32.3</p>
<p>September　　　68.3　　　33.6　　　34.7</p>
<p>October　　　　　80.7　　　38.1　　　42.6</p>
<p>November　　　83.2　　　36.8　　　46.4</p>
<p>However, in the two months after the abandonment, the number of unemployed people decreased by 150,000. During this period, the number of unemployed people should have been constantly increasing, but why could it be reduced as a result? That is because, as shown in the table above, during these four months, British foreign trade had increased from 33 million pounds to 36.8 million pounds. From this we can know that the scope of the decrease in unemployed people is by no means common to all industrial sectors, but only belongs to the export industrial sector.</p>
<p>As for solving the gold pound problem, the British government suddenly abandoned the gold standard and prohibited gold exports as a last resort and a temporary measure; it was by no means a permanent laissez-faire policy. Now, although the discussions on this issue are different, there are three main opinions. The content of these three opinions is briefly described below:</p>
<p>The first opinion is to make the price of the gold pound fall, that is, to make the price of the ordinary gold pound cheaper than before; however, on the other hand, the general prices and wages are the same as before and do not increase or decrease. This is the simplest main opinion of the British Labour Party. Today, there are many people in the British economic sector who agree with this view.</p>
<p>The second opinion is to seek flexibility in gold prices through international coordination. The main points of its advocacy are: when the economy is in recession, the exchange rate should be cheaper than usual, and use this to stimulate general industrial sectors and export sectors. As for the method, it strives to coordinate with the world's major powers. In particular, it hopes to conclude some kind of agreement with the US reserve banks, which account for more than half of the world's gold, to prevent gold prices from skyrocketing.</p>
<p>Although this opinion is extremely ingenious and ideal, it is difficult to carry out in recent years. Because the gold countries such as the United States or France have already solved the difficulties in their own countries when this economic panic is prevalent in the world, how can they still have the energy to help England? This opinion is advocated by the famous British economist Keynes (J. M. Keyens), and many people agree with this view.</p>
<p>The third opinion is to seek to combine the market price of the gold pound with the price index and to balance the changes between the two. Its proponent is the manager of the Bank of England, Sir B. Blackelt. Because the Puxi faction has always been known for challenging "gold autocracy," and wants to harmonize the value of currency with the average market price of goods, so as to replace the gold standard currency and set a currency based on the price index, its purpose is nothing more than to stabilize prices.</p>
<p>Among the above three opinions, the third opinion is quite powerful. However, in the future, the gold pound will not exist to regulate the value of gold; it is bound to regulate the average price of many commodities in the name of the gold pound.</p>
<p>In short, the common goal of the above three opinions is to stabilize prices within the economic region of the British Empire. In other words, the British economic sector, since the abandonment of the gold standard, has been working hard to solve the gold pound problem, and their common conclusion is to abolish the gold standard monetary system and establish a price index-based monetary system; at the same time, this kind of index-based monetary system is the only way out for the British Empire.</p>

<h3 id="e218">Two Reforms in the Gold Exchange <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>▲Change to Using Dollar Standard…Correcting Rollover Date▲</p>
<p>Starting from this rollover (16th), there will be two reforms in the Gold Industry Exchange. One is to implement the abolition of taels and the change to dollars, which has been clearly announced. The other is to correct the early rollover before the specified date. Although this matter was proposed by the brokers, it has not yet been officially decided. Now, the situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) The Gold Exchange Implements the Use of Dollar Standard The Gold Exchange issued a notice yesterday, which stated: "According to the official letter from the supervisor, in compliance with the order of the Ministry of Finance, from the May trading onwards, all bid prices and fund inflows and outflows will be calculated in silver dollars. The handling fee (commission) for each gold bar is 2.1 li in silver dollars, excluding the broker's bonus, the actual charge is 1 fen, 5 li and 7.5 hao in silver dollars. All transactions in March and April, which were originally calculated in customs taels, will be converted to silver dollar prices in accordance with the regulations (715) at the time of this rollover. The rollover transaction should use silver dollar yuan and jiao as the price. The asking price is in units of 1 jiao in silver dollars."</p>
<p>(2) Correcting the Rollover Date The brokers have made this proposal, and the reason is quite justified. Because the Exchange has always had the habit of starting the rollover one day in advance during the rollover. If the official listing on the next day differs too much, customers often complain. Therefore, it is proposed that every time before the rollover, rollover trading should start from 2:00 pm on the day before, and rollover trading prices should be added. This case has been submitted to the Brokers Association and has been passed, but it will be implemented from the next session (because the time is short and the procedures are not completed this month on the 16th)."</p>
<h3 id="e219">Securities: Bond Market Safely Passed Through the Stormy Waves Last Week <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>Last week, from March 6th to 11th, the China Merchants Securities Exchange, the bond market, after the entire observation, can be called a good week. Although there were many changes in the situation, such as the loss of Rehe, the crisis in Tianjin, and the departure of Zhang from the North, etc., the price movement was like a boat sailing through stormy waves, and it safely passed through. Onlookers on land were extremely frightened. In the harsh environment, the price rose against the norm, and the reasons for this are roughly the following four points:</p>
<p>(Related to the war) The gains and losses of Rehe were already expected by speculators and were not related to their interests. Although the situation in Tianjin was critical, it was still a feint by the Japanese, a threatening move. Moreover, the authorities were extremely well prepared, and there would not be any changes in a short time. Retail speculation, subjective mistakes, must be made up after being shorted, which is enough to help the bond market rise.</p>
<p>(Related to transactions) The biggest reason for the rise and fall of the bond market is the comparison of the strength of the long and short sides. The one with strong strength naturally has the advantage. At this time, most of the long positions in the transaction accounts belonged to powerful figures, while most of the short positions were retail investors. The long side remained unchanged from beginning to end, and the short side took the situation as its goal. At first, it insisted, but eventually it relaxed. Supply was difficult to obtain, and the price was naturally not easy to fall.</p>
<p>(Related to the financial authorities) The financial authorities' financial management methods have reversed the previous policy of excessively issuing public bonds and draining the pond to catch fish. Since 1921, no new public bonds in circulation have been issued, so the chips are gradually lacking. Those who hold spot goods have learned from the fall after the September 18th Incident and the rise after the January 28th Incident. They have learned their lessons and are unwilling to sell easily, which is also one of the reasons for helping to rise.</p>
<p>(Related to the money market) Since the war in the northeast was fierce, rumors started in Pingjin, and cash in the north gradually concentrated in Shanghai. There was a surplus of silver and investment was difficult. Buying bonds to generate interest was more appropriate and profitable. This kind of collection was also considerable, and circulation in the market gradually became scarce. This kind of boost also had a role to play.</p>
<p>Looking at the above four points, before there are major changes in the mainland, the long side's defenses are strong and not easy to shake. Therefore, although there were not many transactions last week, except for Monday and Thursday in June, when the loss of Rehe and Zhang's departure from the North, new short positions joined the battle, and the market price slightly retraced a few corners. The remaining four days were gradually rising. In particular, when Chairman Chiang Kai-shek personally went north to supervise the war on Tuesday, the people were greatly encouraged, and the biggest increase was about one and a half yuan. As a result of the whole week, the increase ranged from a few corners to one yuan. The salt tax, at the 40 yuan mark, fluctuated several times, and the result was still closing at 4000 yuan. The process was very good. The total transaction volume was 46,735,000 yuan.</p>

<p>The recent arrival of orchid bamboo branches has been scarce, and inventory is also lacking. However, due to the impure quality of the goods, they are not very appealing to buyers.

<h3 id="e225">Patriotic Business <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Fan Zhongyun</p>
<p>Someone once compared us Chinese to Jews.</p>
<p>Jews are a commercially capable people, and I think the Chinese are even better than Jews at scheming and calculating.</p>
<p>Why? Let me tell you.</p>
<p>Jews are a people without a nation, while the Chinese nominally have a fragmented country.</p>
<p>Everyone says that the country should be loved. Therefore, even though the Jews have been without a country for two thousand years, they are still tirelessly working on the nation-building movement. Since our country has not been destroyed, the nation-building movement is of course unnecessary. What we have now is the patriotic movement.</p>
<p>There are many ways to love one's country: some resist, some resist in name but not in reality, some seek long-term resistance on their own, and some engage in "artistic salvation of the country" and "dancing salvation of the country"... In short, all of this is something that Jews cannot have.</p>
<p>What Jews cannot have is the strength of us Chinese.</p>
<p>Merchants say: big discounts are for saving the country. Amusement park owners say that dancing and movies are also for saving the country. Educators, of course, have even more sufficient reasons, saying "studying saves the country." As a result, business is booming, wealth is abundant, schools and shops are full of students, society presents a "calm" and stable appearance, and China is saved.</p>
<p>Soldiers brave in internal wars say: even one soldier or one soldier must fight to the end. However, once the military expenses are in hand, before the Japanese soldiers arrive, they will deduct the money and move to the concessions as landlords.</p>
<p>There are also those politicians who say: resist while negotiating. This is to use the slogan of resistance to do business with Japan. Rehe has already been given to Japan. Perhaps this deal has a possibility of being concluded?</p>
<p>From the news of Rehe's fall and the rise in public bonds, I saw the success of patriotic business.</p>
<p>The Chinese are truly worthy of being the second Jews - no, it should be said that the Jews are the second Chinese.</p>

<p>The Japanese devils were startled,</p>
<p>Why is the city so quiet!</p>
<p>Could it be the empty city strategy, not even playing the zither,</p>
<p>Ambushes everywhere, heads falling one after another?</p>
<p>Looking from a height, they laughed,</p>
<p>It turned out that the old general was diligently practicing racing.</p>
<p>Large and small cars all head south,</p>
<p>Yellow sand rolling, wind mighty;</p>
<p>Thousands of boxes of luggage,</p>
<p>Tragic and stirring, private pockets full.</p>
<p>Who cares about losing the city and territory,</p>
<p>Anyway, no one can do anything to my old man!</p>
<p>Calculating abacus in Xiliu Camp,</p>
<p>Ten thousand, one hundred thousand, oh, where did that shot come from?</p>
<p>Central Army, is the enemy approaching the city?</p>
<p>Marshal! There are three dark figures jumping in the distance!</p>
<p>Ah! Waaaaaa!</p>
<p>Killing me, why didn't you report earlier?</p>
<p>The general, in a rage, withdrew from the city,</p>
<p>Running faster and angrier,</p>
<p>Running all the way to Turkey,</p>
<p>Living in peace and prosperity, and enjoying a long life.</p>
<p>The Japanese devils are also happy,</p>
<p>Everyone gets what they want, we are buddies.</p>
<p>Don't you see how the nation of Manchuria prospered?</p>
<p>Just dodge south.</p>
<h3 id="e227">Looking at the Positive Side from the Opposite Angle <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Zi Zhan</p>
<p>Because of a serious illness, I escaped from the hands of death, and my frightened soul was just calmed. My mind became clearer, and I lay quietly for a few days, thinking more. Unexpectedly, the more I thought, the more I understood. After reading books for twenty years, I didn't understand, but suddenly I had a flash of inspiration and suddenly understood everything. Ah, I just realized that positive articles should be read from the opposite perspective. For example, when you first arrive in Shanghai, you will always feel the lack of public toilets, especially in the French Concession. If you are a first-class idiot and sincerely believe the announcement "It is forbidden to urinate; violators will be arrested," even if you see urine flowing everywhere and the stench is overwhelming, you can only hold your bladder. Another example is that in the first-class carriages of trams, there are often Chinese and foreign notices saying "No Smoking," but I see many blue-eyed, high-nosed foreigners with cigars in their mouths, smoke everywhere, making people feel suffocated and headache. Not to mention that many advertisements in newspapers are deceptive, but even current event reports must be read with my "opposite perspective of positive articles" at least 70-80% of the time, so you won't be fooled. For example, if a place is cleared and the bandit suppression has come to an end, then the so-called clearing of a certain place is just driving the bandits from location A to location B. Clearing? He Long has died more than once, and there is still a He Long. Zhu and Mao have retreated from their old nest more than once, and they still occupy more than one old nest. As for everyone shouting "aviation saves the country," in fact, I have not seen a plane dare to return a bomb to Japan. Bombing bandits and sinking one's own warships is true. "Long-term resistance" is equal to long-term non-resistance, and "recovering lost land" is equal to "not recovering lost land." You have to look at their opposite meanings. In short, when we read books, do things, and live our lives, we must not be too serious about one side. In addition to positive articles, we must know that there is a reverse side. If you are too serious about one side, you will be known as unintelligent, or you will have the disaster of being beheaded. Things like overthrowing imperialism, overthrowing warlords, and overthrowing corrupt officials and evil gentry, many young people believe too much in these kinds of declarations and slogans and think of themselves as revolutionaries. Their precious lives are lightly given away, and they are even labeled as counter-revolutionaries. Some smart people just use these things as a cover. For small things, they have something to do and don't lose food and clothing; for big things, they are promoted and become rich and honored. Who cares about revolution or non-revolution? They just can't avoid writing positive articles on the surface. People who don't understand the "opposite perspective of positive articles" don't understand books, don't do well as officials, can't get rich, and aren't smart in life. One method is understood, and all methods are understood. I would like to contribute this unique secret to everyone. I invented it myself and do not have a patent.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Parisian Trifles <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Shijun, sent from Paris</p>
<p>When Lie Wen traveled to Europe, he wrote "Parisian Tales" and published them in Shen Bao, which was very popular among readers. Now Lie Wen has returned to China and is the editor of "Free Talk." He sent a letter soliciting manuscripts, so I wrote "Parisian Trifles" in response. I do not care about being considered a slavish imitator.</p>
<p>(1) Coffee Shops and Cemeteries</p>
<p>We usually feel that understanding a friend is not an easy thing. Some people say that to understand a person, you must first have feelings for that person. If you are indifferent to that person, or if you look down on them, even if you spend a hundred years with that person, you will never understand them. I personally agree with this view very much. I think that this should be the case not only for friends, but also for another nation and another country. Probably because I have lived in France for quite some time, I love it more and more every day, especially this novel and antique Paris. The reason I love France is because the French national character is somewhat similar to ours, especially in her humaneness. Yang Yun said, "What human emotions cannot stop, the sages should not prohibit." Su Laoquan said, "Those who are inhuman are rarely not great villains." In recent years, many people have criticized Confucius for his easy and humane words. Foreigners also compliment us when they say that we are humane and know etiquette and do not go against the doctrine of the mean. If it is said that our nation has strengths, I personally strongly believe that the strengths of our ancestors all lie in thoroughly understanding human emotions. This, of course, refers to the golden age of our intellectual circles during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. After that, because the political system was autocratic, the intellectual world was also dark and gloomy, and no ray of light could be seen. But we can hear and see the grand scene that we now imagine based on books in the coffee shops and cemeteries of Paris. This is not a joke. All foreigners who have traveled to Paris generally have the same understanding. At a glance, there are more coffee shops in Paris than tea houses in our towns. Needless to say, most of the people sitting inside are talking. But sometimes they talk very profoundly. Many new philosophies and new literature started in coffee shops. For example, a coffee shop in front of the Panthéon was a place where the poet Verlaine visited every day. A certain coffee shop in Montparnasse was the place where the painter Manet and others gathered. The still-extant Belgian playwright Maeterlinck also met the pioneer of symbolism, Villiers, in a coffee shop when he was young and traveling in Paris. They got along very well and sometimes talked in coffee shops until dawn. If we want to investigate anecdotes of great figures, coffee shops are a treasure trove of such anecdotes. There is another reason why I value coffee shops in Paris, which is that you can see the character of the French nation there. As I have already said, what I love most is her humaneness. For example, if a few people walk into a coffee shop, if they talk about politics, whether it is the left wing, the right wing, the Communist Party, or even the royalists, if they talk about painting, whether it is impressionism, new impressionism, post-impressionism, fauvism, cubism, futurism, new romanticism, new mysticism, symbolism, neo-classicism, Dadaism, expressionism, or surrealism, they can all sit at a table and debate. Sometimes they naturally inevitably quarrel, but they will never quarrel to the point of being out of control. At most, they will ask the police to suppress it and then disperse. After dispersing, they still respect each other. They firmly believe in their own views and also respect the views of others. Therefore, Paris has extreme conservatives and also extreme reformers. This phenomenon seems very contradictory to people with narrow minds. But in the eyes of well-educated French people, it is not contradictory at all. They have a basic belief that people are not perfect and each has their own strengths and weaknesses. They do not believe that there are any flawless saints in the world, nor do they believe that there are any heinous villains. To give another example, in the four magnificent cemeteries in Paris, we see many great figures with very different schools of thought buried in one place. Although each person's thoughts were very different during their lifetime, they became close neighbors after death. This also shows the comedies and tragedies of life. There are four major cemeteries in Paris, each occupying one of the four directions: east, west, south, and north. Molière, La Fontaine, Béranger, Musset, Balzac, the painter Corot, Delacroix, the musician Chopin, and the historian Michelet are buried in the Eastern Cemetery (Pere-Lachaise). The father of modern music, Claude Debussy, and the father of modern painting, Manet, are buried in the Western Cemetery (Passy). In the Southern Cemetery (Montparnasse), there is a memorial statue of Baudelaire and inscriptions of Sainte-Beuve, Coppée, etc. Zola, Alexandre Dumas Jr., Renan, and the painter Millet have tomb steles in the Northern Cemetery (Montmartre). The red-faced and ill-fated Camille, whom the Chinese are familiar with, is said to be a real person, and we can also find her burial marker in this cemetery. In short, the French are not only good at sending life, but also good at sending death. The four major cemeteries in Paris are decorated very elegantly. Walking from the coffee shop to the cemetery, one cannot help but compliment them on their death and life being well placed.</p>

<p>— By George Bernard Shaw, translated by Yi Xian</p>
<p>"Since value is a matter of comparison, how would she know your value unless she knew fifty or so men to compare you with?" said the black girl.</p>
<p>"Oh, God who made men and women like this! Please bless me," the Arab exclaimed in despair. "What am I saying? Oh, wouldn't a child with fifty fathers have no father?"</p>
<p>"What does it matter as long as she has a mother?" said the black girl. "Besides, what you're saying isn't right either. One of the fifty is her father."</p>
<p>"You must know," said the Arab, "that there are many shameless women who have known countless men; but they have not given birth to children; as for me, who pursues and possesses every woman I see who is pleasing to my eyes, I have many, many children. From this it is clear that this kind of unfairness to women is one of God's divine necessities, and it is useless to resist God. God is great and glorious; only He has majesty and power; but His fairness has not been understood by us. My pampered wives suffer so much when they give birth to children, and every time I hear their cries, my heart cannot help but tighten; such pain is something we men cannot endure. This is not fair; if the only way to remedy such unfairness is to let women do men's things and men do women's things, do you think I can sit on the birthing bed and give birth to children? God does not want that. It is against nature. That is all I can say to you."</p>
<p>"I know we cannot go against nature," said the black girl. "You cannot give birth to children; but women can have several husbands and still give birth to children, as long as she is not with more than one husband at the same time."</p>
<p>"Among God's other kinds of unfairness," said the Arab, "is one which is the ordinance He has set that the final word must be left to women to say. I cannot say it."</p>
<p>"What happens," said the creator, "when fifty women gather around one man, and each must say that final word?"</p>

<p>More Than Thirty Japanese Officers Died in Battle</p>
<p>The Enemy Is on High Alert, Believing It to Be a Tense Period</p>
<p>(Beiping) The fierce fighting at Xifengkou has continued for days, and our army has the upper hand. Song's troops have advanced bravely, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. The broadsword team's hand-to-hand combat was particularly shocking to the enemy. Currently, the Japanese side is actively reinforcing and deploying heavily, believing the situation to be very tense. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Japan United News Agency) On the night of the 10th, the Chinese army launched a fierce attack on the Hattori unit, and retreated once on the afternoon of the 12th at 5:00 PM. At 8:30 PM in the evening, they once again launched a large-scale attack with fresh troops. They are currently in battle. (12th)</p>
<p>(Japan United News Agency) The detailed report of the fierce battle at Xifengkou is as follows: On the night of the 11th, the Chinese army dispatched a large number of troops and advanced behind the second line of the Japanese army, taking the shape of encircling the Japanese army's position. On the morning of the 12th, they clashed with the Hattori cavalry, and a very tragic hand-to-hand battle immediately began. The Japanese soldiers were surrounded by the Chinese army, and because the telephone lines were cut, contact with the headquarters was severed, and no reinforcements could be requested. Captain Nakahira and 35 other men were killed in battle. At that time, the Matsuno unit rushed from the rear to participate in the battle. The gun barrels of the Japanese heavy artillery were dripping with red blood. The fierceness of the battle was beyond words. In this battle, the Japanese army had 25 casualties below Captain Katakura. The Chinese army also suffered heavy losses. Furthermore, the Nakamura branch team of the Hattori unit was also attacked by the Chinese army on the night of the 11th, and immediately responded. The Chinese army had ten times more troops than the Japanese army, and its momentum was very fierce. They indiscriminately fired machine guns and mortars. The Japanese army carried out a charge in the rain of bullets, fighting horizontally and vertically. Captain Takada bathed in blood with the treasured sword passed down from his ancestors, and was shot and seriously injured. Sergeant Moriki and Yamada saw the captain injured and went to rescue him, but Takada sternly ordered them to advance towards the enemy. Therefore, the three men rushed towards the Chinese army, and soon fell to the ground one after another after being shot. Captain Takada is currently being transported to the rear, and his injuries are quite serious. (12th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the Japanese military headquarters's public announcement, the Kawahara Brigade, which was fighting in Gubeikou on the 11th, had 13 killed and 65 wounded. In the battle at the Xifengkou position, the Nakahira skill team was met head-on by Song Zheyuan's broadsword team, with 15 killed and more than 30 wounded. At the same time, Captain Nakahira was killed on the spot. (Hua Lian News Agency, 13th)</p>
<p>(Japan United News Agency) On the 12th, the Chinese army attacked the Japanese army in the Xifengkou area several times. Its strength has not diminished at all, but has increased. The development of the Japanese army in that area is completely unpredictable, and the situation is extremely serious. (12th)</p>

<p>Japan Must Fulfill Treaty Obligations Within Two Years</p>
<p>The Vacancy of a Permanent Council Member Should Be Filled by China</p>
<p>丨Criticism from the German Newspaper丨</p>
<p>(Berlin) The German heavy industry media outlet "Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" commented on Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations, stating, "Japan's military actions in Manchuria continue to expand. We believe that until now, Japan has completely disregarded various resolutions adopted by the League of Nations for peaceful resolution. Therefore, Japan's withdrawal does not harm the credibility of the League of Nations. However, even if Japan withdraws, it will not benefit the resolution of the issue, because Article 1, paragraph 3 of the League of Nations Covenant stipulates that any member of the League may withdraw from the League after giving two years' prior notice, but must fulfill all international obligations and all obligations under this Covenant at the time of withdrawal. The true meaning of this provision is difficult for politicians and jurists to agree on in their interpretation, and Japan's future attitude on this issue is also subject to varying opinions. However, regarding this matter, there is one major point that cannot be ignored, that is, the vacancy of the permanent member of the Executive Council left by Japan after its withdrawal from the League of Nations should be filled by China according to law, because among the Asian countries that are members of the League of Nations, apart from Japan, China is the most important."

<p>The Saito Cabinet Is Uneasy</p>
<p>The Movement to Support Hiranuma Is Gaining Momentum</p>
<p>▲Tokyo, 13th Dispatch from Dentsu The Saito Cabinet, which withdrew from the League of Nations and simultaneously shifted from the ideal of establishing peace in the Orient to independent diplomacy, (invaded) Rehe, and brought it to an end due to the swift actions of the Japanese army, and with parliament also having nothing to do and passing a huge budget, will close in ten days. The immediate problem is how the Saito Cabinet will proceed or retreat in the post-parliamentary political situation. Meanwhile, the Seiyukai, the leading party, believes that there will be a coup d'état in April or May due to the meeting between President Suzuki and Finance Minister Takahashi before parliament, and is waiting for the opportunity. The Kokumin Doshikai and a part of the Satsuma faction believe that the Saito Cabinet is powerless and ultimately unable to overcome the extraordinary situation, and intend to support Baron Hiranuma to form a powerful cabinet. Secondly, the Minseito and the House of Peers are secretly promoting the Ugaki Cabinet, but there are also those who advocate maintaining the status quo and extending the Saito Cabinet as the safest option. Therefore, there will be various plans in the post-parliamentary political situation. Will the Saito Cabinet be able to maintain the status quo, or decisively carry out a partial cabinet reshuffle, or resign and entrust the aftermath to a successor cabinet? This is a matter of great concern to all parties.</p>

<p>Actually Claims That Developing the Chinese Market Is Not Enough to Solve Economic Problems</p>
<p>(London) Matsuoka told a Manchester news reporter today that people in the business community should handle some international negotiations on behalf of the diplomatic community. The cotton industries of Britain and Japan must never compete with each other forever. If Manchester and Osaka's cotton industries can jointly discuss this situation, he believes that a solution will be found. It is an unsound theory to regard China as a market with potential and to think that developing the Chinese market can solve the economic problems of the West. Even if one engages in the development of the Chinese market, the low standard of living of Chinese farmers will make them unable to absorb large quantities of products from other countries. At the same time, if China makes progress and becomes industrialized, it will be a competitor of Western products, rather than a consumer. Matsuoka continued by saying that he and Guo Taiqi gave a joint broadcast speech yesterday on the Far East dispute. He said that if he had known that Guo would also be speaking, he would not have wanted to speak at the same time, because after the previous session of the League of Nations General Assembly, he was no longer willing to discuss this issue with the Chinese on the same platform. (12th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held its 69th Memorial Week at 8:00 AM on the 13th. Ye Chucang, Wang Qi, and more than 400 staff members attended. Gu Mengyu presided over the meeting. Kong Xiangxi reported on the recent trends of political parties in various countries, stating that in countries such as the United States, Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, there are several political parties, each with its own banner due to different ideologies. However, during times of national crisis, they can all sacrifice their prejudices to overcome the crisis. Recently, the Hitler cabinet in Germany has emulated fascism in presiding over various political affairs, and the national strength is increasing day by day. Italy is also admirable for its magnificent construction due to Mussolini's overall management of the government and its dedication to governance. The citizens of our country should also emulate the spirit of others, eliminate personal prejudices, and consolidate the central government to jointly overcome national difficulties. (13th Morning Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held a memorial week for the late Premier at 9:00 AM on the 13th. Sun Ke, Yu Youren, Ju Zheng, Dai Chuanxian, Niu Yongjian, Wang Yongbin, Zhu Jiahua, Zhou Zhenlin, Enhe Batu, Li Yuanting, Chen Shaokuan, He Yaozu, Huang Musong, Lü Chao, Wei Huai, and more than 500 National Government staff members attended. Chairman Lin led the ceremony, and Sun Ke reported, stating that there are several major international events that can be reported recently. The United States has recently experienced a financial panic, with bank runs across the country. This is all due to the serious global economic panic and unemployment problems. Moreover, the banking system of capitalist countries has fundamental organizational flaws. The government has issued an emergency order prohibiting the flow of cash, and the panic is gradually subsiding. Since the end of the war, Germany has been governed by the left-leaning Social Democratic Party, which has been unable to overcome national crises. Now that the National Socialist Party is in power, it will inevitably lean to the right, and its influence will make the relationship between Germany and Russia and France increasingly worsen. France has recently changed its foreign policy. Regarding the September 18th Incident, France initially sided with Japan, but recently passed a report to suppress Japan, partly to ally with Britain and partly to maintain the League of Nations. This shows that international relations are purely based on interests. The Premier advocated allying with Russia, because the current policies of Britain, the United States, and Japan are all incompatible with our policies. The Soviet Union and we have the same interests on the issue of Japan, and we should have good relations with Russia. Furthermore, the internal problems of various countries are extremely serious, but their governments all have great determination to overcome difficulties. The resolute measures taken by the United States and Germany to deal with the situation are clear examples. We are now facing a serious national crisis, and the government should actively shoulder the important responsibility of saving the country, leading the people of the whole country to risk their lives and fight to the death in order to find a way out. The ceremony ended at 10:00 AM. (13th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>▲Paris, 12th Dispatch from Havas The "Journal" commented on the impact of the German political situation on Austria, concluding that "the biggest difficulty is that the Austrian National Socialist Party favors the Third Reich (i.e., Germany under the rule of the German National Socialist Party), while the propertied class wants to restore the Habsburg dynasty. We once thought that if the old Austro-Hungarian Empire were allowed to exist, it could prevent the merger of Germany and Austria. We will have another opportunity to prove whether this view is correct or not. In short, those who presided over the organization of the new Europe at the end of the European War made a big mistake, as can be seen from the current situation."

<h3 id="e265">The Current Situation in Outer Mongolia <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>The Outer Mongolian Regime is Completely Controlled by Soviet Russia</p>
<p>Transportation Between China and Russia Has Resumed After the Reestablishment of Diplomatic Relations</p>
<p>Goods from Zhangjiakou Are Being Gradually Transported to Outer Mongolia</p>
<p>Since the severing of diplomatic relations between China and Russia in 1926, communication with Zhangjiakou has been cut off and the Outer Mongolian regime has fallen into the hands of the Soviet Union. At that time, Chinese and Mongolian merchants still traveled back and forth, and transportation between Zhangjiakou and Kulun (Ulaanbaatar) was not completely severed. Goods from the interior could still be transported to Kulun. However, in 1929, when the Sino-Russian war broke out in Northeast China, transportation between Zhangjiakou and Kulun was completely cut off. All of the more than sixty vehicles owned by Chinese merchants operating between Zhangjiakou and Kulun were seized by the Outer Mongolian government, and the drivers were also prohibited from leaving the country. Telegraph communication between Zhangjiakou and Kulun was also cut off at this time. For several years, news between Zhangjiakou and Kulun was blocked. The more than 20,000 Chinese merchants residing in Kulun were initially able to maintain their status quo, but later, after being subjected to exorbitant taxes and levies by the Outer Mongolian government, they were almost completely exploited and are now barely surviving. Moreover, they have no way to make a living and cannot return home. They were once wealthy merchants, but now even working as small vendors is impossible. The central government is too far away to intervene in Outer Mongolia, so it sits idly by while tens of thousands of Chinese merchants are stranded and helpless, unable to be rescued. It is regrettable to see the excellent Outer Mongolian territory being controlled by the Russians. When Xu Shuzheng was appointed as the Frontier Commissioner of Outer Mongolia in 1919 and 1920, all the princes and nobles of Outer Mongolia feared the prestige of the central government. At that time, the national defense should have been actively planned and consolidated, and more troops should have been stationed in Kulun, Chakhtu, Uliastai, Tannu Uriankhai, Kobdo and other places in Outer Mongolia. Military labor could have been used for land reclamation, and the politics and education of Outer Mongolia could have been reformed. If this had been done, Outer Mongolia today would definitely not have been won over by Soviet politics. As Soviet politics has been implemented in Outer Mongolia, the youth of Outer Mongolia have been completely 麻醉 (intoxicated/influenced) by communism. All politics is controlled by the proletariat, and all power is in the hands of the Russians. The highest-ranking cadre governing Outer Mongolia is the Outer Mongolian National Defense Office. This office is a committee system, and the chairman is Russian, with nine committee members below him, both Russians and Mongolians. The internal organization is divided into a Military Committee, a Political Committee, a Labor Committee, and a Transportation Committee. All important personnel in each department are Russian. There are now 20,000 elite Mongolian soldiers who have been trained. Military officers are also Russian, stationed in key border fortresses of Outer Mongolia. All military equipment is shipped from the Soviet Union. The Outer Mongolian monarchy has long been overthrown by Soviet politics. Outer Mongolian children's and youth education textbooks are mostly translated and selected from Soviet textbooks. Russian is also taught in middle schools. Most of the middle school teachers are Russian. There are four middle schools in Outer Mongolia, two in Kulun and two in Chakhtu. As for the Outer Mongolian economy, it has long been bankrupt. Production is backward, and supply is insufficient. Local products such as furs, wool, horses, etc. have been monopolized and sold by the Russians. Now the people of Outer Mongolia are in a state of displacement, and their lives are greatly panicked. Those who are slightly more aware once launched a revolutionary wave in the spring of last year, seeking to break away from Soviet influence, but eventually disintegrated due to lack of unity. Moreover, from 1929 to 1932, transportation between Zhangjiakou and Kulun was cut off, and the domestic situation in Kulun was even more isolated. Therefore, Outer Mongolia has fallen into the hands of Soviet Russia, and the people of the country have also greatly neglected it, which is a pity. In February of this year, due to the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, Chinese and Russian merchants in Kulun planned to resume transportation between Zhangjiakou and Kulun and jointly formed the Oriental Automobile Company, sending two cars to Zhangjiakou to discuss commercial progress with the Zhangjiakou Automobile Association, intending to jointly operate the Zhangjiakou-Kulun trade with the more than 100 cars under the jurisdiction of the Zhangjiakou Automobile Association and the cars of the Kulun Oriental Automobile Company. Now the Outer Mongolian National Defense Office has approved the transit, and also allows the border Mongolian soldiers to pass through Udde (the border between Inner and Outer Mongolia) without strict inspection. Recently, the Zhangjiakou Automobile Association has also sent a car, together with the Oriental Automobile Company's car, to Kulun from Zhangjiakou on March 7 to discuss everything. The Outer Mongolian government also allows the Oriental Automobile Company to communicate with Zhangjiakou on telegrams between Zhangjiakou and Kulun. It is found that the Zhangjiakou-Kulun trade is of great significance to the development of North China's commerce, and it is also of great significance to the revitalization of Zhangjiakou's commerce. Recently, domestic goods have been able to be continuously transported to Kulun. However, the Outer Mongolian economy is controlled by the Russians, and the currency system is also unified by the Russians. Chinese currency is equivalent to waste silver after arriving in Outer Mongolia, and the Outer Mongolian taxes are extremely heavy, with a tax of 70 yuan for goods worth 100 yuan. The currency system and taxes still affect the progress of Sino-Mongolian trade, so in the future, the central government is expected to pay attention to the Outer Mongolian issue as soon as possible (March 6).</p>
<h3 id="e266">Talking about Li Liejun's Task in Shanxi <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>(Please Yan and Feng to Maintain the Overall Situation in North China)</p>
<p>Taiyuan Telegram. Central Committee member Li Liejun came to Bing yesterday and discussed the great plan of resisting Japan with Yan. When a reporter recently visited Li, he obtained the following conversation. Li said that his task here has about two points, one belongs to the country, and one belongs to the individual. Regarding the national aspect, at the time of the daily urgency of foreign insults and the invasion of strong neighbors, if we do not catch up quickly, the future of the country will be unimaginable. Recently, Chengde has already怯戰 (shown cowardice in battle) and given up, then the fall of North China can be expected immediately. Yan and Feng have long been highly regarded in North China. This time, the Japanese are rampant. If there are no important officials who are responsible for their expectations to shoulder the great difficulties, then the call for resistance against Japan will eventually become a pie in the sky. I intend to meet Yan in Bing, and then meet Feng in Zhangjiakou to discuss everything. It is also necessary to take this opportunity to invite Yan and Feng to take up the great plan of resisting Japan. This is what I am doing on the national aspect. As for the individual aspect, I used to be in the same class with Yan in the Dongying Military Academy, and we were classmates. Feng and I used to share hardships in the Northwest. Then, because we were in different places, we have not seen each other for a long time. It is convenient to visit and comfort them. Both publicly and privately, it is a little comforting. However, during the national crisis, I really can't bear to talk about any personal matters. I personally hope that after our beautiful mountains and rivers are completely restored, everyone, brothers, can drink heartily in one hall, which is comforting. Last night, Yan was very enthusiastic and had a banquet at the Sui Office until 12 o'clock before returning to the residence. Yan was also very sad about the national crisis. Speaking of this, the reporter asked Li about his feelings about the fall of Chengde. Regarding this point, Li said that he had too many feelings about this matter, and he was afraid that he could not tell them all in a short time. He especially ordered his entourage, Zhang Migong, to show the reporter the speech he made when he passed through Shijiazhuang, and especially noted the following. In the past, three provinces were lost without fighting, and now Rehe is abandoned because of怯戰 (showing cowardice in battle). This is a unique shame of the Chinese nation in the history of our country. The firm ice of the frost is gradually coming. Those of us who serve the central government have failed to plan ahead, and we are extremely ashamed. There are many good generals and soldiers who can fight in the country, and the people's patriotic spirit is even more available. If we can make good use of it, it will not be too late to斩将塞旗 (behead the general and plant the flag) and defeat the enemy. It lies in the government and the people rising up in time. I came here to benefit the war situation, and I also deeply hope that the sad and generous scholars of Hebei will rise up together for the country.</p>
<p>Yesterday (7th) at 11:00 a.m., important people here such as Sun Chu, Zhou Dai, and Rong Honglu set up a banquet for Li at the Shanxi Hotel. At 6:00 p.m., Chief Staff Officer Zhao Daiwen, Secretary-General Jia Jingde, and Chief of Staff Zhu Shouguang, etc., had a banquet for Li at Jia's residence. Li also went to Jinci with Rong Honglu, the commander of the garrison, for a tour at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. Li's entourage also went to hear that he was scheduled to go to the Hebian today with Yan to visit Yan Fengweng and express his condolences for his illness. (March 8)</p>
<h3 id="e267">Chen Jitang Arrives in Chaoshan <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>Instructs on the Opportunity of Suppressing Bandits and Resisting Japan</p>
<p>Shantou Telegram. Chen Jitang took the Haizhou warship to patrol the sea. He landed in Haifeng Shanwei on the 3rd to inspect the troops of the 5th Division Zhang Da. On the 4th, he arrived in Lufeng, passing through Huilai, and inspected the independent division Zhang Ruigui. On the 5th, he arrived at Lihu in Puning and inspected the highway. Chen paid much attention to the traffic on the first trunk line, the Shantou-Shantou Highway, because the Puning-Jieyang section has not yet been completed. It was originally planned to go to Chaoyang via Puning Liusha, but I don’t know why, the trip to Chaoyang was cancelled, and it was decided to take the road to Mianhu to Jieyang. Shantou Mayor Zhai Zongxin and Municipal Party Committee member Yu Zuming were both called to Jieyang. It is heard that Chen will go to the Xichang in Jieyang to commemorate the war in which He Ye was defeated in the past, or he will first arrive in Chao'an via the Jie'an Road. Major roads in Shantou City have been decorated with welcome slogans, and all sectors are preparing to hold a welcome meeting at the Kuangchang of the Datong Theater.</p>
<p>The troops stationed in Chaoshan are quite active in suppressing bandits and resisting Japan. Mines have been laid outside Mayu Estuary, and martial law has been declared on the sea, as well as the time for ships to enter and exit. Heavy troops are also guarding the coastal area. It is also heard that the second phase of the general offensive order of the bandit suppression army in Jiangxi Province is about to be issued. The three divisions of Huang Renhuan, Huang Zhiwen, and Huang Yanzhen, who are stationed in the upper reaches of the Han River in Guangdong Province, are responsible for blocking and suppressing bandits. It is heard that Chen has instructions on the above two points during this tour. Chen intends to stay in Chaoshan for three or four days, and then go to Meixian Xingning with Huang Renxian and return to the province via Huizhou. (March 7)</p>
<h3 id="e268">The Japanese Consul in Shantou Shields Taiwanese Smugglers <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>Customs Repeatedly Intercept Japanese Smuggling</p>
<p>Taiyi Maru and Hailong Maru Repeatedly Transport Sugar</p>
<p>Shantou Telegram. Shantou's economic severance of relations with Japan is very organized, but the other side is also doing its best to undermine it. National Salvation Associations in the urban area continue to seize enemy goods, and customs patrol ships have also repeatedly intercepted smuggled enemy ships at sea. For example, last month, the Beidou ship seized Taiyi Maru on the sea off Nanao, carrying 98 bags of white sugar. (According to the customs, foreign sugar tax is collected, and each bag must be fully paid)</p>
<p>The tax is 12 or 13 yuan per bag, so sugar is the main product for smugglers). It was immediately detained and returned to Shantou Port. When the Japanese consul heard the news, he immediately pleaded with the customs commissioner to return the ship, and claimed that the ship was a first offender, promised to pay the tax, and was responsible for no more smuggling in the future. However, less than a month after the Taiyi Maru incident, on the 2nd of this month, customs patrol ships again seized Hailong Maru on the sea off Shantou. Its smuggled goods were more than Taiyi Maru. According to the personnel of the customs patrol ship, on the morning of the 2nd, the Chaohai ship sailed out of Mayu Estuary to patrol. It saw a suspected electric ship near the Dezhou Lighthouse, with a Japanese flag hanging on the stern, so it sailed forward for inspection. It saw that the ship was carrying 95 tons of Javanese sugar, a total of 950 bags, and more than 20 boxes of whisky and Samsung brandy, all of which were goods subject to heavy taxes, but none of them had been taxed. There were twelve crew members on the entire ship, including one Fujianese and one Chenghai Houzhai person, and the rest were Japanese and Taiwanese. The customs officer immediately inquired about the origin and whereabouts of the ship. According to the answer, it started from Keelung, Taiwan, and went to Macau for unloading. The customs patrol ship suspected that it was smuggling, so it towed it back to Shantou Port and detained it in front of the customs. The customs commissioner specially ordered the shipowner to go to the customs for questioning. According to the shipowner, the goods on the ship were returning to Taiwan from Hong Kong. Because of the waves the night before, it approached the mountainside to hide. The customs commissioner said that his statements were inconsistent, one because Macau also needs sugar, and there is no need to transport it from Taiwan. Second, because Taiwan is a famous sugar-producing area, there is no need to transport it from Hong Kong. As for encountering wind and hiding in Dezhou on the way, it is even more absurd. However, it is heard that the Japanese consul will come forward to shield the smuggled ship again. (March 3)</p>
<h3 id="e269">Statistical Table of Salt Tax Revenue in the Past Twenty Years <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>Tax Revenue Decreased During the Northern Expedition</p>
<p>Gradual Increase After 1920</p>
<p>Central tax revenue is mainly composed of customs and salt taxes. In terms of salt tax, the national statistics, from 1914 to last year, the annual income in the past 20 years is as follows: 1914 (1914) was 50,908,402.77 (unit: yuan, that is, the above is more than 50.09 million), 1915 was 55,972,7870.17, 1916 was 63,016,467.37, 1917 was 63,988,787.20, 1918 was 68,890,500.92, 1919 was 71,980,277.26, 1920 was 77,046,032.96, 1921 was 82,370,694.90, 1922 was 87,762,828.55, 1923 was 79,883,180.44, 1924 was 75,888,324.69, 1925 was 79,144,093.06, 1926 was 77,927,522.29, 1927 was 55,268,508.42, 1928 was 58,541,852.44, 1929 was 69,723,002.39, 1930 was 139,391,487.19, 1931 was 176,651,151.52, and 1932 (last year) was 160,833,648.12. According to the above, there was no increase or decrease from 1916 to 1926. In 1927 and 1928, the tax revenue was greatly reduced due to the military affairs of the Northern Expedition. It was not until the national unification in 1930 that people celebrated peace, and the salt tax also increased rapidly.</p>

<p>Deducted from Each Factory and Transferred to the Municipal Government</p>
<p>March 12 is the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death. The government stipulates that all factories will stop work for one day and wages will be paid as usual. The trade unions in the city, in view of the deepening foreign insults, advocated that the wages that should be obtained on this day should be donated to aviation to save the country. This has been approved by the central government. The Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Government have been ordered to comply. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>(Party Department Notice) The Municipal Party Department announced that, for the matter of the announcement, it was found that on the 12th of this month, it was the eighth anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death. The association has repeatedly received inquiries from various trade unions on whether to close down as usual, and most advocated that the revolutionary memorial day wages that should be obtained on this day should be used as donations from the labor world to aviation to save the country. The association has greatly admired the labor world for being so knowledgeable and enthusiastic about saving the country, and the ambition is extremely commendable. On the 7th of this month, it was telegraphed to the central government for approval. According to the reply from the Central Secretariat on the gray day, the Yangdian has been approved by the Standing Committee for handling. In addition to the letter to the government, the special reply, etc., are hereby approved. In addition to the letter from the municipal government to various merchants and factories, the revolutionary memorial day wages that should be issued on this day will be deducted and transferred to the municipal government. It is urgent to publish an announcement, so that all trade unions and merchants and factories in the city will comply with it to relieve the national crisis. It is very important. This is a special announcement.</p>
<p>(Municipal Government Order) The Municipal Government ordered the Social Affairs Bureau that, for the sake of complying with the order, the Administrative Yuan Song Dynasty President Zhendian said, "I have recently approved the letter from the Chairman's Office of the National Government, stating that the wages that the labor world should add on the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death in this session should be used as donations for aviation, etc." I should immediately transfer and strictly follow the order, etc. As a result, the country is in distress, and it is the autumn of the people's efforts to love the country. In the face of frequent foreign insults, donating to aviation is even more urgent. I was ordered to order them to恪遵毋違 (strictly follow and not violate). This order</p>

<p>There Are Still Many Obstacles in the Special Zone</p>
<p>The China Factory Inspection Association believes that factory inspections in the city have been implemented for a long time, but there are still many obstacles in the special zone. The government authorities are arguing on the basis of reason because the matter concerns national rights. The association takes improving the inspection business as its mission and is more concerned. It should assist in the progress. Furthermore, this matter is of great importance to the national sovereignty and the interests of the industrial community itself. It relies on the support of public opinion to enlighten people's hearts and promote progress in different ways. Therefore, it is scheduled to provide refreshments at 2:00 p.m. on the 14th of this month at the Huaan Building, 8th Floor, Jing'an Temple Road, and invite the press of the city to discuss the progress.</p>

<p>The Huangpu steamer of the British-owned Swire Shipping Company, operating the Shanghai-Hankou route, issued a company notice on February 15th to lay off twenty-three of the coolies from the steamer's steerage. The coolies, believing the company intended to oppress them, collectively protested, submitting several petitions to party and government authorities requesting intervention. The steerage coolies' association also ordered all eighty-six coolies not to leave the ship without permission and to continue working as usual. After several mediations by party and government authorities, the company agreed to increase the number of coolies to thirty, adding seven more. After the coolies were advised, they also relented somewhat, agreeing to fifty. The steamer arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 11th), and representatives from the party and government went to negotiate, but no agreement was reached due to the significant difference in the proposed number of coolies. Today, the company again invited party and government authorities. Representatives from the Municipal Party Headquarters (Zhou Lianze) and the Social Affairs Bureau (Wang Xianqing), along with the comprador Du Benchu and the coolies Qian Ziyun and Song Xiaoyun, were sent to negotiate at 2 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e283">Three Robbers Arrested by Xinzha Police <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>▲Escorted to Court This Morning for Trial</p>
<p>Detectives Cui Chengke and Zhao Fuhai of the Xinzha Police Station learned that robbers were hiding in room 50 of the Donghua Inn in Xiangfen Lane on Nanjing Road, planning illegal activities. Consequently, at around 3 AM the day before yesterday, they secretly went to the address and arrested Chaozhou native Wang Lao Si, Chen Erchu, and Changzhou native Shen Rongsheng. They were taken to the police station. Investigation revealed that Wang and Shen, on the fourth of last month at 9:30 AM, had led a gang armed with weapons to break into the accounting house rented by Wu Minsheng at 196 Tianjin Road, robbing them of $4,685 in cash and silver dollars. They were detained and escorted to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special District Court this morning. The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated the case, saying that Wang and Shen had confessed to the robbery at the police station, having conspired with accomplices still at large in room 10 of the Yongle Inn on Fujian Road on February 3, and continuing the discussion at 6 AM the next day in room 427 of the Zhongnan Inn on Edward Road, deciding to commit the robbery. They set out at 9:30 AM with five people. Shen stood guard downstairs, while the others went upstairs. After obtaining the loot, they convened to divide the spoils. Wang received $250, and Shen received $50. Yesterday, the detectives learned that Wang and others were staying at the Donghua Inn and went to arrest them. Chen Erchu was arrested as well because he was staying with Wang and Shen. The police charged Wang and Shen with armed robbery under the criminal law. Chen Erchu's detention was requested. Subsequently, Wu Minsheng filed a case, detailing the robbery, and stating that the defendant Wang Lao Si had previously worked for him. Judge Qian Wenji briefly questioned the defendants and ordered them detained for further questioning in seven days.</p>

<h3 id="e286">Lin Pengju and Sister Trafficking Children <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>Children Bought from Chongming and Qidong</p>
<p>Fujian native Lin Pengju and his sister Lin Yuying recently bought two children in Chongming County. At around 8 AM the day before yesterday, they boarded the Zhoushan Maru at the Yangshupu Wharf, intending to return to their hometown to sell them for profit. Detectives Wang Guangqi, Hu Guangrong, and Yang Zhaoqing of the Hongkou Police Station learned of this and, along with Detective Chief Shi Enjian, secretly boarded the ship and arrested the Lin siblings. The two children, one five years old and one two years old, were also taken to the police station and detained separately. This morning, lawyer Zhang Tianyin of the police station stated that the police charged the defendants with human trafficking under Article 257, Section 2 of the Criminal Code. Investigation revealed that the defendants conspired with Xu Ziying, who is still at large, to go to Chongming and Qidong counties, where they bought the five-year-old boy for $100 and the two-year-old child for $52 from impoverished families. Because both defendants are from Fujian and do not speak the local dialect, Xu Ziying handled everything. Their plan was to bring the children back to their hometown, sell them to wealthy families, and share the profits with Xu, who would then purchase more children. Xu lives in a shanty in Yangshupu, Taopeng Road. The detectives rushed to arrest him, but he had already fled. It is unclear whether the children were abducted in Chongming and Qidong or in Shanghai. They requested a postponement for further investigation. Questioned, defendant Lin Pengju stated that because he and his sister Yuying had no sons, they entrusted Xu, who is still at large, to purchase them as adopted sons. The parents of both children signed contracts at the time of purchase, one in the First Gang of Qidong County and one in Renhe Township of the same county, but the purchase documents were lost in haste. His remaining testimony was evasive. His sister Lin Yuying testified that she did not know Xu and had not gone to Chongming. She asked her brother Lin Pengju to buy the two-year-old child as her son. Judge Wu Zehan ordered them to be detained separately for further verification. Lawyer Zhang of the police station requested that the two children be temporarily sent to the Women and Children's Relief Society for care. The court approved this.</p>

<p>The home of Fan Songliu at number 2, Qinli Lane, Xuexi Street in the Nanshi district was robbed last night at around 9 PM, just after dinner. Four robbers wearing gabardine short shirts and trousers suddenly arrived. They all spoke with a northern Jiangsu accent. Two robbers rushed into the living room, each taking out a pistol, and forbade anyone from making a sound. The other two robbers quickly went out to stand guard, preventing any unexpected events. As a result, one hundred silver dollars, fifty dollars in paper money, two gold rings, and one silver bracelet were robbed. After the robbery, they quickly fled into the alleys to the north and south. By the time nearby officers arrived, the four robbers had vanished without a trace.</p>
<h3 id="e289">First Phase of Seven-Province Highway Construction Nears Completion <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>National Economic Council Proceeding with Second Phase</p>
<p>The National Economic Council is proceeding with the second phase of the Seven-Province Highway construction. A reporter from the Datong News Agency interviewed the person in charge of the council this morning, inquiring about the current status. They received a detailed response, recorded below.</p>
<p>(Planned Content) According to the Seven-Province Highway plan drafted by the National Economic Council's specially appointed League of Nations road construction experts, Mr. Pootly and Mr. Okaski, the entire project is divided into two phases. The first phase is to complete the Beijing-Shanghai, Beijing-Changsha, Beijing-Wuhu, and Suzhou-Jiaxing highways, totaling approximately 1,600 kilometers in length. Currently, the Beijing-Shanghai Highway is nearing completion, and the Suzhou-Wujiang section of the Suzhou-Jiaxing Highway has also been completed. The Beijing-Changsha and Beijing-Wuhu highways are scheduled to be completed by the end of May. Then, in early June, the second phase of the project, which is larger in scope than the first phase, will begin. The total length of the highway is over 6,700 kilometers. According to the National Economic Council, the complete highway is critical for military transportation during this time of national crisis. Therefore, it is proposed to order the construction departments of all provinces to complete the construction of the highways within their jurisdiction this year. At the same time, it is also proposed to consult with the Ministry of Military Affairs to order the troops stationed in each province to cooperate in the work. The government will provide funding to facilitate the progress of the project.</p>
<p>(Decision Steps) Regarding the steps for proceeding with the second phase of the project and the budget for funding, the National Economic Council convened engineers from the construction departments of each province in Beijing from the 6th to the 9th of this month to discuss solutions. The result was a decision that engineers from the construction departments of each province should first construct bridges and culverts along the highways in their respective provinces, and then proceed with the road surface. The Economic Council will send personnel to each province to supervise the progress, with the goal of completing the project as soon as possible. After the national government directly allocates funds to the council, the council will then distribute them to each province.</p>
<p>(Full Line Opening) As for the date of the full line opening of the Beijing-Shanghai, Beijing-Wuhu, Beijing-Changsha, and Suzhou-Jiaxing highways completed in the first phase, based on the current situation, it should be realized in mid-month. League of Nations road experts Mr. Pootly and Mr. Okaski test-drove the Beijing-Shanghai Highway on the 3rd of this month and found it very satisfactory.</p>

<h3 id="e290">Military Pledge <a href="#e290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— Geng</p>
<p>This is an ironclad fact: when the brutal Japanese occupied our Northeast, it was without firing a shot. It wasn't that their soldiers were "descended from the heavens," but that our "policy of non-resistance" helped them succeed. Having tasted such an enormous and easy advantage, the brutal Japanese not only remained unsatisfied, but also sought more, casting greedy eyes everywhere, coveting our Jehol province and seizing it as easily as reaching into a bag. The reason for this was that Jehol abandoned its duty, retreating without a fight. In this situation, it is clear that one side has retreated to a point where it is being criticized both internally and externally, and where it can no longer tolerate it; while the other side is still elated, taking one step further after another. As the saying goes, "Even a trapped beast will fight to the death," so it is no wonder that our young marshal was provoked into a thunderous rage, and "in anger over the loss of Jehol, volunteered to assemble all the basic units of the Northeast Army to take on the front-line combat, taking responsibility as the vanguard, making a 'military pledge' to recapture Chengde within a set number of days." (See the 10th Shishi News and 9th this newspaper Evening News) Good heavens! "The good do not come, and those who come are not good." The Japanese better quickly prepare ships to cross to the east, for the result will certainly be that they "cannot swallow it!"</p>
<p>As for what a "military pledge" is, in this year of unclear rewards and punishments, perhaps some have forgotten its seriousness? For example, Guan Yu, who released Cao Cao on Huarong Road, was ordered by Kongming to be "dragged out and beheaded," all because of the "military pledge"! The "military pledge" that the young marshal is willing to make this time is undoubtedly "no small matter," although its full depth remains unfathomable. Judging from its meaning, it is, of course, to swear to recover Chengde within the specified time (naturally not a long time); if Chengde is not recovered, he swears not to return alive, which is the same as what was previously said, "to defend the national border with blood and life." If the stars of the general are high, and the solar stars resolve the situation, and enemy bullets dare not approach, and he is forced to return alive, then because "there is no joking in the military," he should also show the true colors of a hero, and frankly accept the serious punishment of being "dragged out and beheaded," no, dragged out and shot. This majestic "military pledge," which is enough to make the enemy tremble in fear, if indeed made by the young marshal and carried out by the young marshal himself, would heaven and earth not be shaken by it, and would soldiers not drink blood for it? Just as Fan Li did not commit suicide to wash away the shame of Kuaiji, and Cao Mo did not die to erase the humiliation of three defeats, but in the end avenged Goujian and repaid the shame of the State of Lu, it is clear that our young marshal will also make this earth-shattering "military pledge" to recover Chengde, in order to wash away the great shame and humiliation of the fall of Shenyang, the retreat from Jinzhou, and the loss of Yuguan! Therefore, towards this "military pledge" that gives us great hope, how can we not stand in solemn respect and pay our sincere tribute!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Mr. Chiang knows that he is bragging and does not believe him. He still asks him to use one of his thirty-six stratagems, fearing that he will not only fail to recover Chengde, but also send away Tianjin and Beiping. He can only accept his deep kindness, respectfully thanking him but not accepting his offer.</p>
<h3 id="e291">A Hard Battle <a href="#e291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>Dongyang previously did not believe it, thinking that even if it happened, it would be accidental. Even though the bragging in the newspapers every day was so intense, with Ah Fu raping Gendi and Ah Da seducing Xiao Mao, when you look at "Ah Fu liked women, and Gendi was young and promiscuous, resulting in seduction, so they were lovey-dovey, flying together as a couple," you can know the truth of the matter, but if the matter breaks down, the responsibility lies entirely with Ah Fu. Ah Fu rapes Gendi, but in fact, when they commit adultery, Gendi is also fully in agreement.</p>
<p>So, although the newspapers are full of such records, Dongyang still does not have confidence, believing that women always escape a portion of the responsibility.</p>
<p>So, what he says to his wife is naturally very doubtful, saying that it is all about whether a woman is proper or improper. This might be because he is in front of his wife, so his tone is particularly heavy, but his wife only says that he is an outsider, no wonder he doesn't understand, and that one day he will have to see it for himself.</p>
<p>This is the third time. His wife dragged her tired body, her unsettled soul, and walked back in a panic. At first, she was speechless, then she cried for a while. Finally, she said to her husband:</p>
<p>"I really don't want to do this unlucky work anymore. Those bastards dare to make passes at me in front of me. Damn it..." She cried again.</p>
<p>"What happened? Tell me properly!" Dongyang asked comfortingly.</p>
<p>"You know, that stinking slut, Fourth Sister De, is always flirting, and that feminine air attracts those scoundrels, making them drool. As a result, in the alley..." the matter breaks out, and they become angry from embarrassment. No wonder everyone looks down on her, and no wonder you once said that women have to take responsibility."</p>
<p>"As for that slut, Sixth Sister Xiao, I've seen her several times with my own eyes. A good-for-nothing named Peng flirted with her, and she just went along with it. As for me, I never bat an eye at anyone, let alone pay attention to those things. Today, that pig Luo, who's surnamed Wang, kept standing next to my spinning machine, smiling and making all sorts of strange faces. I didn't care and told him straight:</p>
<p>"Am I not doing a good job? Write a note and give it to the accountant to fire me!"</p>
<p>Instead, he pouted and smiled sweetly, saying:</p>
<p>"I never thought you would be so fierce! Are you tired? I'll wait for you at the XX Road intersection at 8:30 tonight. How about we go see a movie together!"</p>
<p>"I was really furious, so I turned around and left. I'm not doing this damn work anymore!"</p>
<p>Hearing this, Dongyang suddenly perked up.</p>
<p>"Ha, those bastards are really like that? Ha, wait for me to go!" He immediately stood up, flexing his sleeves.</p>
<p>"That would be best. Let's go together. That bastard is definitely waiting for me at the XX Road intersection, thinking that I'll really fall for his trap. Go, let's go together!"</p>
<p>His wife pointed out the man standing by the tram platform, wearing a Western suit, holding a newspaper, and Dongyang rushed forward, throwing him to the ground with force, followed by punches and kicks. Suddenly, Dongyang felt two punches in his back, and his back was throbbing with pain. Undoubtedly, it was some bodyguard of the Wang good-for-nothing who had come.</p>
<p>In the midst of the difficult fight, three or four police officers came and, without saying a word, dragged Dongyang and his wife into jail, while that Wang good-for-nothing walked away leisurely, as if singing a triumphal song. The police officers just looked on.</p>
<p>"If you don't do this unlucky work, you have to sit in this unlucky jail, and it's even dragged you down," his wife said.</p>
<p>"Yes, this is the reality of today's society! But at least Wang good-for-nothing suffered a good lesson from us! What's needed now is how to teach those dog policemen a lesson," her husband, Dongyang, said.</p>
<h3 id="e292">Escape <a href="#e292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>— Xianxia</p>
<p>At noon, in front of the M school gate, it was like an exhibition, with everything: selling squid, braised spiced beans, egg slices, dried tofu, water chestnuts, lottery food, and even stationery and rubber bands.</p>
<p>The innocent and lively children, before class started, were always surrounding these food vendors, some buying food to chew on with relish, others enthusiastically playing the lottery. Those without money could only watch others with envious eyes. The children were not stingy in taking money out of their pockets, which was also the only guarantee of livelihood for the vendors.</p>
<p>"Here they come! The big guys are coming!" A vendor selling spiced beans near the road shouted as he quickly ran away. At this time, the lively atmosphere suddenly became tense.</p>
<p>A police officer, as fat as a pig and wearing a uniform, chased after them. The vendors desperately ran for their lives. The squid vendor hid under a pile of wood across the street, the spiced bean vendor squatted next to a trash can, and others fled elsewhere. In an instant, they all disappeared. But as soon as the police officer walked past, the scene in front of the school gate returned to its original state.</p>
<p>"Ah yo! Sir, please forgive me!" The police officer came back from the other side, and the vendors ran away for the second time. An old woman in her fifties who sold water chestnuts was caught by the police officer because she was too slow to run. She begged him in every way, but she could not move the police officer's heart. Then, he kicked the basket of peeled and white water chestnuts onto the ground. She had no choice but to squat on the ground, gather them up, and walk away with tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>A child selling rubber bands, about ten years old, holding a bunch of rubber bands in his hand, was also seen by the police officer because he was not agile enough to hide. First, he received two slaps, followed by a scolding.</p>
<p>For the sake of making a living, the vendors had to endure such suffering.</p>
<h3 id="e293">Saturday Afternoon <a href="#e293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>
<p>— Qiling</p>
<p>Saturday afternoons have always been a time for students to rest or play, with no classes.</p>
<p>Because the curriculum in middle schools is relatively light, the Ministry of Education this year issued an order that all middle schools should have classes on Saturday afternoons, adding more courses. As a result, the students inevitably expressed some boredom (?).</p>
<p>"How annoying! Today afternoon was supposed to be for playing ball, but we have to go to class."</p>
<p>"I can't see the 3:00 movie anymore."</p>
<p>"I had a date with my girlfriend today, but I'm tied up with schoolwork, so I have to reschedule."</p>
<p>"………………………………"</p>
<p>Various different complaints were made by every student, all cursing Saturday afternoon classes. They never thought about who would benefit from Saturday afternoon classes!</p>
<p>As fate would have it, the course on this particular Saturday afternoon was geography, which everyone considered unimportant. Since the homework was not important and the teacher was easy to talk to, some people were absent without reason, and others reported their attendance and then escaped from the classroom pretending to go to the toilet. They thought they had won, and they went to do what they wanted to do. Out of sixty-odd people in the grade, only half remained, going through the motions.</p>
<p>"Teacher! Please take attendance again." The headmaster came to inspect the classroom, and because he saw that there were too few people, he became suspicious and took the roll book to take attendance again.</p>
<p>As a result, excluding those who were absent without reason, there were eight people who escaped during class.</p>
<p>The next morning, a long rectangular piece of paper was posted on the headmaster's bulletin board, writing:</p>
<p>"××, ××, ... eight people are skipping class; each will be given a major demerit as a warning to others. Headmaster Bai."</p>
<p>…………………………</p>
<p>Alas! You reap what you sow.</p>

<p>— Shen Liewen</p>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>Your Shop Assistant Correspondence column is for us shop assistants, workers, and apprentices to resolve our doubts and difficulties. Since its inception, we have received many benefits. Now I have another difficulty, and I would still like you to give me guidance. The matter is like this: before "January 28th," I worked at a × paint factory in Zhabei. After the war, of course, I was unemployed. Although I can't talk about academic qualifications in the paint industry, I can say that I'm not bad at it, based on my ten years of experience. About half a year after being unemployed, after many twists and turns, I found work in a certain paint factory in western Shanghai: not only can I solve my livelihood problem, but I also have the opportunity to make use of my previous experience. I was overjoyed. Now the products in the factory are much worse than the products in the factory where I used to work, but the raw materials are the same, just the methods are different. Because I am "eating the well water of the family and helping the family," I became enthusiastic and advised the technician to change to my method, so that the products would become increasingly excellent and the sales would increase. But he always ignored me and refused to adopt it. I really don't know if he is "enduring" or lazy! In short, my experience, if it goes on like this, will never be brought into play! Sir, what do you think I should do? (Omitted) Shen Liewen respectfully</p>
<p>×　　×　　×　　×</p>
<p>Editor's note: Chinese people have a kind of inferiority, which is "not only unwilling to improve themselves, but also unwilling to allow others to improve." His motives are nothing more than two, which Han Yu called "laziness and jealousy." If this kind of inferiority is not eradicated one day, China will really have no hope one day. The technician in Shen Jun's factory is deeply poisoned by this. We believe that if Shen Jun really has real experience and the certainty of improvement, you should discuss it with the manager, and he will definitely take it. Because improving products is directly beneficial to him. As for the technician, he is afraid that once you succeed, he will have to step down. So if you want him to adopt your method, it is really like seeking the skin of a tiger, and there is absolutely no hope.</p>

<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(II) The Beginning in a Dream</p>
<p>Forty-three years before the events of the previous section, Dr. Wu Yi was born in a small, remote county along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway line: that was K County, famous throughout the land for the inexplicably named "Old Master" three characters.</p>
<p>At that time, there was no Beijing-Shanghai Railway, nor any small steamships. The transportation between K County and the outside world was unimaginably inconvenient; and the people who lived in K County mostly adhered to the ancient saying, "While parents are alive, do not travel far." They were reluctant to move their bodies more than ten miles away from their homes. However, during a certain period—that is, during the period when a large number of "Scholars and Recommended Men" were produced—twice a year, as usual, there would always be a group of bookish friends who had spent ten, twenty, thirty, or forty years in their studies like widowers, embracing gorgeous dreams as bright as brocade, bidding farewell to their parents and wives, and hurriedly setting off in groups on the only means of transportation in the interior of 18th-century China—sailing boats—heading towards the location of those pigeon-box-like examination halls. Of course, when they returned, occasionally a few would hire large official boats, raise yellow flags, and return—those were a few exceptions, carp leaping over the dragon gate. Most, however, still returned in small sailing boats.</p>
<p>That autumn, as usual, another group of fame-and-fortune-seeking young people, middle-aged people, and old people were preparing to leave their hometowns and do a "flower gambling" style illusory dream. The barefooted men who steered the sailing boats were also busy running on the streets; old customers were naturally unwilling to be sacrificed, and new customers were eager to be won over.</p>
<p>"Second Master! Needless to say, you must give us some lucky money!" The Wu residence on South Street was a well-known family in K County, full of scholarly descendants: Second Master Wu was one of the best among them. Although he had returned without success three times, he was still young and had great hope: so this time, in the heart of Old Mao, the boatman, he was sure to have another good customer.</p>
<p>"I'm not going this time!" Second Master Wu gave him an unexpectedly disappointing reply in a very gloomy manner.</p>
<p>"Don't talk nonsense! Second Brother! Don't miss your future!" Before Old Mao could try to win over Second Master Wu again, First Master Wu, in his position as the elder brother, sternly refuted his words.</p>
<p>"That's right! Second Master is guaranteed to pass this time, he should definitely go!" Old Mao, having received the help of First Master Wu, encouraged him with extra force.</p>
<p>"But, I..." Second Master Wu still wanted to struggle, and this was to his elder brother.</p>
<p>"The eldest brother is like a father, can you disobey my words?" First Master Wu got angry and decided to enforce it. "Old Mao, reserve that middle cabin for us brothers!"</p>
<p>Of course, the younger brother could not defy the words of the elder brother; this was the rule of a family of scholars and etiquette. Second Master Wu submitted to this rule: but at the time, his attitude was extraordinarily flustered and melancholic. For a long while, he paced back and forth in his study, then took the opportunity to slip out and went straight to the residence of a family named Cheng across the street.</p>
<p>The Cheng family used to be a wealthy family, and they are still not poor, but all the men in their family died early, leaving only a widow in her forties and a Miss in her teens. Second Master Wu, not knowing by what chance, had fallen in love with this Miss, so much so that the Miss's belly had swelled as high as a young mistress's; but, unfortunately, Second Master Wu already had a lawfully wedded young mistress at home, and First Master Wu absolutely forbade his younger brother from marrying a second wife, so a very serious problem arose.</p>
<p>But Miss Cheng's belly was getting higher day by day, and the crystallization of love was about to be born; so the widowed Mrs. Cheng, in the unofficial capacity of prospective mother-in-law, ordered Second Master Cheng not to go to the examination. However, on the other hand, his elder brother insisted on forcing him to make a struggle for family honor; Second Master Cheng was in a dilemma, truly in a very awkward situation!</p>
<p>"After returning from this examination, no matter what, I will definitely find a way to marry you and bring you home! I would rather separate from my elder brother than let you down!" After some internal debate, Second Master Wu's desire for advancement prevailed over his affection for his children, and he decided to go to the examination. He asked his lover, Miss Cheng, for her consent with an extremely sincere attitude.</p>
<p>Of course, Miss Cheng couldn't just agree to him; later, he had to make a few extremely venomous oaths—the only way to persuade women—and Miss Cheng herself had a new realization, knowing that even if Second Master Wu didn't leave, it wouldn't relieve her pain during childbirth, so she agreed.</p>
<p>On the seventh day after Second Master Wu left K County, a promising child emerged from Miss Cheng's belly. The Cheng widow's house was filled with a very mysterious joy.</p>
<p>…………………………………………</p>
<p>One month, two months passed... First Master Wu returned from the examination, bringing back a coffin, announcing the bad news that Second Master Wu had contracted an illness and died in the examination hall.</p>
