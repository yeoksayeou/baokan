<h3 id="c24">中國經濟復興之前路　實 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>世界經濟會議失敗後各國羣趨於實行經濟的國家主義。旣努力開闢國内巿塲。復以全部精神發展海外貿易。換言之。即提高關稅以保護其本國製造品。在另一方面。則獎勵輸出。以圖物價之增高。於是世界所謂國際合作。徒成虚名實際上乃極端相反。物產殷富如美國如蘇聯。其努力於「自給自足。」原有可能。英國雖形勢散漫。然其統帥能力强。合全世界之英國自治領殖民地。以聯成大英帝國之經濟聯盟。尙可與美蘇相比併。惟東方之日本。西歐之德意志。實無法以自給自足。乃亦竟高倡自給自足之經濟者。徒以軍事上關係。勉自支撑現局。藉勤求遠略。以掩蔽其當前之罅隙而已。</p>
<p>我國當此時會。感受强隣之積極侵凌。由不流血之經濟鬥爭。轉換而爲激劇之軍事侵略。在經濟上我國國民經濟。僅在發展之過程中。一切組織。皆較先進諸國爲幼穉。而軍事設備。無論陸海空軍。皆不能應付近代式之立體戰鬥。矧近代戰爭之續持力與决勝點。皆應以整個經濟體系爲根幹。有經濟鬥爭之力量。然後乃能從事於國際鬥爭。二十餘年來。我中華民國上自政府下迄國民。皆扭於錮習。未嘗具有猛進之决心。故亦遂無積極行動。以打破此經濟侵略之惡劣環境也。</p>
<p>頃者全國經濟委員會。鑒於目前世形勢之緊張。主張將舊有組織。盡力擴充。如農村水利交通電氣衛生等項。均以專家董司其事。非特熱心建設之人。對此滿懷希望。即衰微之國運。亦將由此而生回轉之機運。吾人因特提出農村水利交通三項。一面促起國人之注意。一面對當局者貢獻其一得之愚。　　我中國農村經濟。其手工業時期中之發逹。已臻極點。而從事於農業之人民。其勤勉亦著稱當世。然而近百年以來。因資本主義發展之結果。遂使我國農村頓受莫大之災殃。旣受廉價商品之無形侵蝕。復被國際巿塲之明顯排。擠。人口集中於都巿。農業生產。愈見衰落。而國内種種意外糾紛。均隨之而起。今後農村問題。如高利貸。如土地問題等。倘不得適當之解决。匪特土匪之剿除成爲問題。即一般人事行政。一時恐亦難於穩定。是以挽回我國之厄運。唯一要着。在乎安定農村秩序。復興農村經濟。</p>
<p>我國今日之禍患。人謀不　。固爲重要成分。天災流行。亦屬當前鉅害。而天災之中。水患實居居第一。黄河之害無論矣。揚子江流載域素稱富庶。近亦備受水禍。推源其禍之所由起。在於溝渠不修水道不治。吾人知黄河套裏水患。以東水有堤而收灌漑之利也。成都平千里沃野。以有灌口一閘之力也。故講求水利。切要之國。端在修治溝渠。疏濬河川。因勢而利導之。則今日之横流。他日可以載舟楫。灌漑田畝矣。</p>
<p>近今交通工具。日漸發逹。輪船火車。似皆已後於時代。不復爲交通界最要利器矣。航空在軍　上固居首位。即一般交通之運。　亦以飛行機爲第一我國號稱古國。產業落後。已無可諱言。發展航空事業。誠爲「迎頭趕去」之捷　但經濟上之建設。重工業之基礎。亦萬不可少在歐美先進諸國。於輸船火車充分發逹之後。益以航空其勢順。其行便。我國則横貫南北之鐵道。津浦平漢。僅及其半。自東至西。隴海僅逹陜境。中部惟恃長江。設專恃航空發展。固不能以飛機運送煤炭鋼鐵。即汽車運輸。亦不能收任重致遠之效。故完成隴海路延長至迪化。接通粤漢路。實爲交通界之急務。而修築川漢路至於康定。使首都與邊疆各地。不再隔閡。尤爲必要之圖。設使此種交通計劃而果實現者。則國民蒙其惠。政府收其功。經濟復興。亦得充分利用此種工具。以發展我國將來之繁榮也。</p>

<p>反正僞軍部分、在長春縣三區界　朱家城子民團二千餘名、因不服日軍繳械、表示反　抗日、現在磐石縣境内、再有永吉缸窰駐防第十三團、因與日軍衝突、亦行反正、又有延壽縣新出現之鋼又隊、約有二萬人勢甚兇猛、現已將駐將防僞軍張統策逐出縣境、至於我義軍現駐地點、及實力等報告、以關於軍事秘密、暫不發表、</p>

<p>＝在佘山洋面出險雙錨均斷＝</p>
<p>＝飄流二十餘小時自分必沈＝</p>
<p>＝傷四船員貨物等損毁不貲＝</p>
<p>招商局新銘輪、爲北洋班第一優秀輪、此次在佘山洋面、突遇颶風、在海内飄流二十二小時、萬分危險、竟能脫險來滬、實出徼倖、現須修理、茲將遇險詳情、分誌如下、</p>
<h3 id="c123">佘山遇颶 <a href="#c123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>新銘輪、八月三十一日下午十時半、由威海衛開出、初尙平順無事、至二日上午十二時、該輪在佘山海面之北約十六海哩、已遇大風陣雨、至下午一時、接得天文台警告、謂颶風已到、時該輪適當大風中心圈内、船主急欲駛回威海衛避風、顧此時風自東北吹來、朝北已不可能、向南又多暗礁、更不能駛、决計向北、在大風雨中抛錨暫泊、伺機開行、詎輪方掉頭、颶風已到、海浪如排山倒海、迎頭打來、有高至三四十尺者、使新銘受空前未遇之大險、</p>
<h3 id="c124">濁浪排空 <a href="#c124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>其時風浪之大、爲該輪航海所遭第一次、一浪打來、全船包入水中、船主馬家駿·急傅全體職工海員、下緊急動員令、將船身頂對風浪、無如風力如山、船向後退、急抛雙錨、欲將船身停住、而竟無效、船主再令司機者、在下錨後、開全速率向前衝進、藉以抵抗惡浪、詎非但無絲毫前進、依然爲浪擊退、此時全船職工、着急萬分、蓋照此情勢、必遭觸礁擊破、全輪貨客、同歸于盡、如此相持約六小時船身總爲巨浪捲擊倒退、船主再命放長錨練、三十托巨練、盡抛海内、仍難挽救危機、</p>
<h3 id="c125">打毁貨物 <a href="#c125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>至晚八、風浪更巨、一浪打來、將領江台上物件、艙面所裝貨件、旅客行李箱籠等項、悉　打到海中、船主大二副等、已不能在　駛台工作、紛紛至下層改配嚮盤、仍站大風雨中奮力指揮、不意連來四五丈高之大浪數個、更將大餐間·官艙間·統艙間、以及甲板上·欄杆·並門窗户板·帳篷纜索繩練等項、完全打毁、海水狂冲進艙、全輪各處、均浸水内、而船身忽直忽落、人亦不能站立、船員旅客三百餘名、悉陷水内矣、</p>
<h3 id="c126">斷練失錨 <a href="#c126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>正在一髮千鈞之際、頻發無綫電、而徐家匯台天線已斷、呼號不通、船内乘客二百餘名、紛爬至大菜間内、呼號慘泣、一片哭聲、業務部職員亦跪在水中、求神告天、船主更發開特快車命希冀萬一之抵禦、在三日晨三時左右、見錨練發火、砰然一聲、兩練盡斷、兩支巨錨、均失落海中、船身突然傾斜、勢將覆沒海内、其時船主自分必將無幸　欲拔手槍自殺爲大二副奪去、正危急萬分之際幸復來一巨浪、轉將新銘輪扶直、此正徼天之大幸、否則全輪已早覆沒無存矣、</p>
<h3 id="c127">飄流海面 <a href="#c127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>斷練之後、馬船主再令將船上留餘巨練、儘數放入海中、聽其飄流、置生死於度外、一面用水尺打測深度、至三日晨四時、測見水深五托（即三十尺）船上人員、更大恐失色、蓋沙灘將到、暗礁即至、船已失去自主能力　如再後退、必觸礁粉碎、依然無一生存、正在束手待斃、欲發救命衣與旅客之際、突接天文台報告、謂大風方向、已自東北變而爲西北　檢視船中風雨表、已漸見升起、絶處逢生、一線希望又現、急再努力奮進　計自遇風起至轉風止、新銘在海面、共經二十二小時之飄流</p>
<h3 id="c128">絶處逢生 <a href="#c128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>三日晨五時、風浪仍巨、而陣雨不止、幸方向已轉、新銘飄流、漸向海中、脫去灘礁之險其時船仍頂浪飄流、至天明後九時脫去大危機、風亦漸小、其時天文台報告、颶風至東經一二三度北緯三二度、馬船主急命起鍊、調正向南航行按自遇風至此全輪船員水手、在大風浪中奮力工作、已經四十小時、未臥未食此際亦不知究到何處、十二時漸見一山船主按圖查檢、方悉已抵花鳥山、預算自佘山被風飄流、已經四十海里以外矣、但風雖小而仍不能行駛　海面不見一船、至下午四時、始達大戢山、全船之人始有生命之希望、</p>
<h3 id="c129">打傷水手 <a href="#c129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>據馬船主語記者、今回大風浪、實爲有生第一次遇見　總以爲無生回之望、而結果能徼倖脫險者人力亦天助　、全船各艙多打壞、引記者觀看幾無一門窗完好者、在最險時、上台甲尙水深三四尺、則其他各艙之水、浸入可知有水手及舵工等四人、在艙面工作、被一大浪自船頭直打　船尾　四人爲水浪甩撞於艙面鐵器　均各身受重傷而舵工一名、受創更深、其他各船員水手等、爲大浪擊打、而遭輕傷者更不一而足、艙内物件、非打去、即爲海水捲落海内、損失之數亦不小也、</p>
<h3 id="c130">昨晨進口 <a href="#c130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>新銘輪在三日下午一時、方脫險開滬、直至下午六時半、船到吳淞口外揚子江口、當時因錨已失落、祇得再退至淞口外抛泊、候至昨晨、始克進口、到金利源碼頭、時船上客位與艙面建築、已破壞不堪、當即報告總局、經劉鴻生派工程師到輪檢騐後即行大修、以備重予裝置、並對歷險各船員慰勞有加、以能於萬險中、安抵上海、均各船員之力與血也、船内旅客抵埠時、亦驚喜交集、雖行李全失、而均感佩馬船主之臨難不亂、各人保全生命、不啻更生、但上陸時、衣履透濕、狼狽不堪、損失總數、至少三四萬金云、</p>
<h3 id="c131">船主餘恐 <a href="#c131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>馬船主又對記者談、新銘到洞沙時、該處設有燈船一艘、爲航輪指示方向、今次竟爲大風打去、燈塔息去、黯然無光、燈船亦不知飄流何處、燈船内管理人員、度亦遇險矣、又揚子江口之燈塔、燈光亦被大風打息、致使新銘暗中摸索、又徐家匯之無綫電天綫、亦被颶風吹壞、使海輪不能通報、聞太古順天輪在途、亦遇大風改遲兩天進口、須於今日到滬、</p>

<p>▲發生糾紛　此次該會球類、計有足籃排網四種、川沙僅參加籃排兩種、故四項球類除籃排球採用淘汰制比賽外、足球網球俱係上海與南滙對抗、以勢力沽計上海操必勝之希望、故南滙川沙兩縣選手、已有灰心是爲糾紛之總原因、當本月二日風雨交作、該會競賽組臨時宣佈、於上午比賽排球、上海選手以風大球輕、要求停賽、當抽籤時上海未允加入、而大會已决定於十二時比賽、上海縣選手以是時適在午膳、均未到塲、大會競賽組宣佈上海縣以棄權論、遂引起反感、</p>
<p>▲緊急會議　籌委委乃於是日下午一時召開臨時緊急會議、到全體籌委、由曹振飛主席、當卽議决籃球比賽、第一塲於二日下午四時起、第二塲五時一刻起　網球於三日上午九時起、足球於三日下一時起、惟對排球問題、以南川兩縣主張上海縣爲棄權、而上海縣則堅决反對、致未解决、</p>
<p>▲籃球比賽　三日下午四時、三縣籃球選手遵照籌會决議、各厲兵秣馬、準備交戰、雖風雨未停、各無怠意、抽籤結果上海川沙首次交戰、警笛一鳴、雙方佈陣、至五時十分結束、結果上海戰勝川沙、（紀錄該會負責人不肯吐露）上海縣選手大戰甫定、精疲力盡、而第二場比賽時間已至乃勉强應戰、結果爲南滙所敗、籃球錦標卽爲商滙所得、</p>
<p>▲反對延期　三日風雨仍未稍息、上海縣提議延期比賽、遭川沙南匯兩縣反對、乃於上午九時上南兩縣網球選手入塲比賽、而評判員忽告缺席、遂致發生問題、下午一時足球比賽、評判員又告缺席、各運動員只得在無可如何中聽候解决、</p>
<p>▲分配奬品　球類比賽、足排網三類均無結果、已如上述、南川兩縣旣不主張延期再賽、又堅决必須於三日返縣、致錦標問題、無法解决、籌委會乃再開會議、結果、對未經比賽之三種錦標平均分配、排球錦標贈川沙、網球錦標贈南匯、足球錦標贈上海、風潮於是平息、於當日下午轉車由曹專員給獎畢、三縣選手各乘汽車、在潮雨中分途起程、臨别時三輛車上歡呼者有之、謾駡者有之、誠爲有趣之最後餘興也、</p>

<h3 id="c220">解决監犯性慾問題 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 醉痴生</p>
<p>解决監犯性慾問題，司法當局業已决定辦法。但據在下愚見；其中有尙須商榷之處。茲特揭舉於下：</p>
<p>（一）這背優生律丨德國希特勒氏，近爲改良人民個性及有健全之身體起見，特頒「優生律」。凡社會不良分子，如犯罪，瘋　，及遺傳病等，均須設法停止其生育，或消滅其生育機能。此法定明年一月起實行：我國地大人衆固無效法之可能。但罪犯在刑期内，是自然停止生育之時期。若許其夫婦兩月或三月接近一次，是無異獎勵其生育。以殘暴淫票之徒，在惡劣之環境中，其所生之子女，當然無「優坐」可望，其遺傳性實屬可怕。道豈不是與「優生律」大相違背嗎？</p>
<p>（二）無解决之必要丨俗語說得好：「飽暖思淫慾。」足見一個人處在愉快的情景中，性慾纔有衝動的機會。至於犯了罪的囚徒，身在縲絏之中，飽嘗鐵窗風味。其身體上與精神上，都感受深刻的痛苦。那裏還有閒情逸致，想到這「黄　樹下操琴」般的工作呢。所以這性慾問題，似無代爲解决之必要。</p>
<p>（三）不平等的待　丨這明法，原爲獎勵安分守規的犯人起見。但以正式夫婦爲限，其他無夫無婦。或非正式夫婦的犯人，仍抱向隅，沒有此種待遇。那末這解决，仍非激底的解决，反　引起其餘犯人心理上之不平，及性　的衝動。况獎勵之法正多，又何必用此難以普遍的性工作來獎勵呢。</p>
<p>以上三點，似尙未經人道過。在下特寫了出來，藉供法律家的研究。總之這解决性慾問題，好像是「舍逐末」，尙非目下切要之圖。最緊要的，還是從飲食，便溺，衛生，諸問題，及一切積弊，繁頓改良。那末監犯倒一致能得着實惠咧。</p>
<h3 id="c221">撲蠅悟「道」 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>秋風起了，秋蠅特别多。今天晨餐時，我瞧到桌上有三四個蠅兒在時停時飛著。我知道它們是我們的大敵，忙取得蠅拍，瞄凖了，想把它們一網打盡。那知「拍」的一聲只有一個敵人死在我的鐵腕之下，其餘的都逃躱到不知那里去了，那時我雖然不免有些失望，可是仍靜坐桌旁，待機而動，而它們呢，竟似漏網之魚，再也不到我的眼前來了。我不由得丢了蠅拍，長歎一聲。</p>
<p>蒼蠅是無知的動物，似乎不會有機心的。然自人類發明了蠅拍而後，它竟一天一天地乖巧起來。這已出乎我們意想之外。即如我這次撲蠅，一個上了當，其餘都蓄著戒心，相率遠避，即是明證。語云：「有機事者必有機心」。這句話眞說得大有道理，再引申言之，蠅拍本是撲蠅的一種治標工具，要想憑此正本淸源，並沒有什麽大效用；因爲治標不過是濟一時之急，而正本淸源乃圖永久之計，决不會如此簡單的。所以我想一拍而滅盡蒼蠅，不能不說是我的錯誤。　　撲蠅如此，别的事也何獨不如此。所以末了，我要套一句古文家的筆法說：「君子於此，可以悟道！」</p>
<h3 id="c222">由「丫頭」挨打而發 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 傅翼之</p>
<p>林肯以爲「奴制是立於不公道和惡劣的政策上的」，所以他主張奴隷洲加入聯邦；雖然引起了歷史上有名的南北戰爭，伹結果，北方各邦獲得最後的勝利，終於一八六三年元旦，發表宣言，實行釋放南邦的黑奴，這在人類文明史上，的確是値得紀念的一回事，</p>
<p>中國也常自誇爲世界文明的古國，可是，買賣的奴隷制度，至今還不曾革除，雖然隨着革命的高潮，曾一度狂熱地喊着「解放」</p>
<p>「家員」「書僮」一類的名目，好像已經不存在，至於事實上的有無，那是另一問題；伹丫頭的名稱和蓄婢的事實，則所在多有，無庸掩諱；不過這名稱和事實，只存在於布爾喬亞階級的集團中而已。</p>
<p>最近冒失踏在小資產階級生活圈的邊沿，最使我發生莫名的感觸的，便是這個生活圈裏被雇的女傭和被買的婢女之多，出乎我尋常想像之外，其中陰霾，悲慘的事實，也當然比較更多的發現；不久以前，某號門牌裏的一個「丫頭」跑掉，連累間壁鄰居的「丫頭（十七八歲的小姑娘）犯嫌疑，結果，鄰居的「丫頭」遭殃，動因細故而遭受主人的毒打，輕則也要罰跪三小時，但不准哭，近日更不許人看；間或有一二個獃頭獃腦的人道主義者，站出來喊兩句「不是」，但也不過只是喊喊而已·據說：這個小姑娘正盼望着旁人去搭救，假使有個劍客一類的人物，肯發揮他的本能，搭救出這無辜的可憐的婢女，我想：他的功績，不在林肯下。</p>
<p>這里，　　的　　又發生了，我們要想救伊出樊籠，並非一件難事，可是，旣出樊籠之後，伊的衣，食，住又怎麽辦？而且，丫頭非伊一個，受折磨的，想也不止伊一個，　山川菊榮的解說，就是看護婦，小學敎師等，都可稱爲贊銀奴隷，那末，奴隷已佔社會上絶對的多數，自己還是這奴隷圈中的一個，自救不暇，怎敢　然高談救人？執筆至此，不禁連聲太息！</p>

<p>— 閻重樓</p>
<p>那淸淸如水的，那光明如鏡的，那純潔如處女心的，那不是深深印在我人心目中的月亮嗎？</p>
<p>在大自然的郊野，每當夜之神展開它的翅翼的時候，我們的月亮便漸漸的從山窈裏透出來，伊沐浴在輕鬆的空氣裏，露着温柔的淺笑，於是林木，泉流，草坪，··都被伊澆上一層銀色的光輝。一切的生物都活躍起來丨連微小的毘蟲也都爲伊而謳歌歡舞。</p>
<p>在塵囂的都巿裏，電燈，霓虹燈，不分晝夜的照曜着，高大的建築在四週遮蔽着，使我通宵望不見渴慕的月亮丨有時候我抬起脚跟，仰起頸項，才得看到伊是侷促在屋頂上，露着一個愁苦的臉。我想安慰伊，並想對伊訴我相思之苦，但在這時候却會有一陣陣的濃烟，從那屋順上的烟囱裏面冒出來，於是我連伊那愁苦的面龐也望不見了！</p>
<p>一様的月亮，在都巿裏就顯得是黯澹無光了。「月亮喲！你不要因傷感而嗟嘆，也不要因失望而悲哀，你應該知道這環境是根本不適宜於你的，這裏是需要另一種月亮的世界。」</p>

<p>氣候，已由熱而凉；景色，將由繁榮而趨於　索；動物的血，亦已由沸騰而至於寗靜；這是炎夏逝去，新秋來到人間應有的現象。</p>
<p>過去是火傘高張，人們都熱得走頭無路，全靠着冰淇淋，鮮橘水來平一平心頭之火，現已秋凉，這些東西都用不着了，準備着欣賞那亮亮的秋月，大嚼那團團的月餅吧！</p>
<p>以前是外侮日亟，國人都義　塡臂，全憑着喊幾聲「抗日救國」的口號，息一息胸中之氣，現在，僞軍次第收編，察事又告解决，女局已定，「抗日救國」的名詞已不時　了，大家都去安居樂業準備着歌舞昇平了麽？</p>
<p>氣候，已由熱而凉，人的血液，已由熱而凉，中國的一切亦都由熱而凉，啊！秋凉了！秋凉了：怪不得大地是這様地寗靜。</p>

<p>桂枝發着楞道：你們這是什麽怠思，你們說吃元宵沒關係，我說吃元宵，你們就鼓掌。曼英笑道：你覺着很是奇怪不是？說明白了，你就不以爲奇了。元宵是團圓的東西，你和趙連長同吃，最是···趙自强放出苦笑道：黄小姐，别這様開玩笑。曼英道：我把實話告訴你罷。昨天關連長去後，我就到了。蒙楊老太的好意，留我住下。我就趁了這個機會，就在楊趙二府，前後院跑一個夠，把親事提上一遍。楊老太和楊老女士，說着，將手輕輕的拍了桂枝兩下肩膀，笑道：都表示贊同了。我就說了，現在的婚姻，不是賣買婚姻，男女兩方面，總得自己談話。不過二位雖是院鄰，可是向來不大通言語，第一次誰也不好意思約誰出來說話，在家裏呢，更是不便當了。我就和楊女士說了，我來介紹二位在一個地方···桂枝就輕輕的在他手臂上碰了一下，瞪了眼道：我說了是今天嗎？曼英道：今天也是一様，明天也是一様，分什麽日子。田靑正色道：倒不是日子的問題。大姑娘，你要知道，黄女士到海甸來，是不大容易，他來了呢，又不見得就遇到我們的趙大哥。所以今天趁着大家凑到一處的機會，就約着在這裏談談，倒不是專爲開玩笑。桂枝這就沒有什麽可說的了，伙計進來，問二位小姐，要些什麽。桂枝搶着答道：我要一碗茶湯。（註炒小米粉，加糖於内，以水冲之。）黄曼英道：爲什麽不吃元宵？桂枝笑道：這是由各人所喜。我愛吃茶湯，爲什麽不讓我吃？曼英道：你愛吃茶湯也罷。不過我也要下一碗元宵請你。趙連長，你捨得不捨得？（一七八）</p>

<h3 id="c226">培養美貌 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>在我做女孩兒的時候，有一個老保姆曾經鄭重其事的對我說：「英　只是皮相約」我總覺得這句話是　浮不足信，後來有一天，我的叔叔在老保姆所說的話加上這麽一句：「但是　陋却是入骨的」，才完成了伊原來的意義，我也恍然大悮，得了相當的　藉。知果女孩兒喜歡話，　伊們保存這顆小小的虚榮心</p>
<p>現在大多數的母親鼓勵伊們的女孩兒去培養美貌了，這種的確是好方法，因爲，假使女孩兒在年輕的時候，對於　　，皮　，牙齒，和運動，都有相當的注意，那麽伊們將來大　來，一定有美　的春貌和健全的體格；而且還有最重要的一點，那便是伊們對於自身，也會有相當的認識和適當的保養。</p>
<p>我願指導每一個女孩兒去注意伊的頭髮，每天早晨和晚上，　十分鐘去刷頭髮，是値得一做的。我願鼓勵伊去保護伊的皮膚，不單是靠了利用　水或化壯品的帮助，而且要靠了實行深呼吸和運動的功效，使皮膚逹到潔白滑膩滋潤柔嫩的地步，多　的新鮮空氣，當然使皮膚變爲潔白滑腻滋潤柔嫩的最有效最顯著的東西　　現在學校中的運動，對於兒童是很有利益的，但是，假如母親與兒童每天早晨，實行一次規定的運動，如柔軟體操之類，那麽日間的愉快生活和美麗容貌已經創造成功了。</p>
<p>至於牙齒，在學校裏也很注意，亦有相當的檢查。珍珠一般潔白的牙齒，的確是每一個女孩兒的光榮，但是刷牙齒的訓練，應該從幼年時期開始時起，就着手實行的。一個孩子剛會拿牙刷的時候，就要敎他或伊怎様用牙刷，然後再講給他或伊聽，爲甚麽口要這様謹愼的嚴厲的保存一種淸潔和良好的狀態。假使做母親的對於子女的牙齒和口多少注意一下，那麽他們將來大一半的疾病可以避免了。漱口也要敎導兒童的，並且還要敎他們用一種鼻的薰滴法；行此方法後，許多惡劣的傷風也可避免。</p>
<p>有限制的虚榮心，不能再算作一種罪惡了，所以末了我更願意指導每一個女孩兒去注意伊的衣服，使伊對於服裝有種興趣，敎伊去尋最適合伊本人的顏色和式様，讓伊在剛有能力管理自己衣服的時候，訂定一張衣服表。同時我願指導伊去淸潔和整理伊的衣服，敎伊怎様刷，怎様摺，怎様放，怎様藏。（我願同様的去指導男孩子，要知道一個未來的做媳婦者定會十二分的感謝我咧。）</p>
<h3 id="c227">衣服與健康 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>

<p>衣服對於你兒童的健康的重要效力，不能夠通分着重的。</p>
<p>不用紐扣而套進去的衣服，有許多不同的壞處，其中最顯著的是使胸部狹小，肩部低圓，以致呼吸不暢，營養缺乏，竟緊而形圓的領圈，容易使兒童患耳痛，緊的橡皮腰帶足以造成消化不良。</p>
<p>兒童背痛的原因很多，其中最普通的是用吊褲帶。這様短而拉住出於平衡的全身的吊褲帶，是最有效果的使兒童患背痛。做母親的應該見到用吊褲帶的兒童，不大高興游戲的。</p>
<p>見到用吊褲帶的兒童，不大高興游戲的。</p>
<p>鞋子也是十分重要的；假使鞋跟太高（指皮鞋而言），那麽孩子的重心常向前了，這様足以使小腿的筋肉過分引長。過分引長，便是過分的用力，結果是容易有扭歪的毛病。</p>
<p>太寛的衣服亦應避免。所謂太寛的衣服是包括寛得肩上時常滑脫的勞工式服裝，長得拖過手腕的衣袖，和統子常常倒下來的襪子而言的。</p>

<h3 id="c253">帮閒法發隱 <a href="#c253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— 桃椎</p>
<p>吉開迦爾（S·Kiegaardi8r3-r855）是丹麥的憂鬰的人，他的作品，總是帶着悲憤。不過其中也有很有趣味的，我看見了這様的幾句丨</p>
<p>『戲塲裏失了火。丑角站在戲台前，來通知了看客。大家以爲這是丑角的笑話，喝采了。丑角又通知說是火災。但大家越加哄笑，喝采了。我想，人世是要完結在當作笑話的開心的人們的大家歡迎之中的罷。』</p>
<p>不過我的所以覺得有趣的，並不專在本文，是在由此想到了帮閒們的伎倆。帮閒，在忙的時候就是帮忙，</p>
<p>譬如罷，有一件事，是要緊的，大家原也覺得要緊，他就以丑角身份而出現了，將這件事化爲滑稽，或者特别張揚了不關緊要之點，將人們的注意拉開去，這就是所謂『打譯』。如果是殺人，他就來講當塲的情形，偵探的努力；死的是女人呢，就更好了，名之曰『艷屍』或紹介她的日記。如果是暗殺，他就來講死者的生前的故事，戀愛呀，遺聞呀···人們的熱情原不是永不弛緩的，但加上些冷水或者美其名曰淸茶，自然就冷得更加迅速了，而這位打諢的脚色，却變成了文學者。</p>
<p>假如有一個人，認眞的在告警，於兇手當然是有害的，只要大家還沒有僵死。但這時他就又以丑角身份而出現了，仍用打諢，從旁裝着鬼臉，使告警者在大家的眼裏也代爲丑角，使他的警告大大家的耳邊都化爲笑話。聳肩裝窮，以表現對方之闊，卑躬歎氣，以暗示對方之傲；使大家想：這告警者原來都是虚僞的。幸而帮閒們還大抵是男人，否則，牠簡直會說告警者曾經怎様調戲牠，當衆羅列淫辭，然後作自殺以明恥之狀也說不定。周圍搗着鬼，無論如何嚴肅的說法也要减少力量的，而不利於兇手的事情却就在這疑心和笑聲中完結了。牠呢？這回牠倒是道德家。</p>
<p>當沒有這様的事件時，那就七日一報，十日一談，收羅廢料，裝進讀者的腦裏去，看過一年半載，就滿腦子都是某闊人如何摸牌，某明星如何打嚔的故典。開心是自然也開心的。但是，人世却也要完結在這些歡迎開心的開心的人們之中的罷。</p>
<h3 id="c254">簡捷的作品鑑别法 <a href="#c254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— 傖</p>
<p>靑年大抵是求知的慾望高，而鑑别的能力弱，於是『究竟看誰的文章好？』成了一致的問題。解答這問題，本是件煩難而艱深的事；但也有一種簡捷的鑑别法，便是看作者做那篇文章的動機。</p>
<p>讀者旣茫昧於作者的生活環境及其思想，當然看動機也很不容易。我們看一篇作品，必然要就牠本身的内容裏去理解，便是看牠告訴我們的是怎様一回事？牠所說的是那一種道理？如果牠能夠撳起了我們的情緒的時候，我們必需内省是那一種情緒的反應？</p>
<p>事情可分作兩種去看：一種是寫他自已的事情，而與我們沒多大的關係的，縱或寫别人的事，也和我們無關痛癢；另一種是寫大衆的生活使人們不能漠然，或寫他自己的事情而具有大衆的暗影的。道理也有兩種：一種是爲他自己的利益去『掉舌頭』，或想頑强地拉住了已經陳腐了的舊時代的一切，甚或裝上新思想的幌子而其實還是奴事舊制度的歪曲的理論；另一種却是爲社會的合乎時代的不畏强禦的正論。情緒的反應也姑且分爲兩種：一種是滑稽有趣，狂誕，甜美，或怡然而輕快的流涙：另一種却是刻骨的辛酸，悲憤，自己剝脫與自尊自覺，或覺得好笑而又覺得難受的含涙的笑。固然，以上的各個分野均無礙其爲藝術，但牠們有種歧點，便是利己與利他的不同；而我們所謂鑑别者，便是要在這其間揀擇一下。</p>
<p>對於一篇作品的感應，我們簡捷地分析下來，不外乎以上這些。作者對於這些性質的顯示，無論其爲有意或無意，他們總該有一個動機，動機一明白，就發生了作者的人格問題丨丨再加上手法的高低，就成了作品估價的標準。如果作者的動機是爲了自己消遣，務名牟利，諂媚求榮，甚致用政客的陰謀利用筆桿去做劊子手···他們便不惜踐踏靑年，將靑年化成了『藥渣』。</p>
<p>因之，近代的個人的享樂，必需建築在别人的血肉之上。在目下這人吃人的世界裏，我們如果還有一點爲社會的熱情，就應該不貪甜頭，不怕辛酸苦辣。反之，如讀者看文章的目的也和文壇敗類的動機一様，那末，他將是一個靑年中的蟊賊。</p>
<p>沒有看文章的正當態度和鑑别能力，便不能認識那作品的眞價。我們對一篇作品而不能探出作家所顯現的人格時，雖看過也等於不看。譬如一個我們所欽佩的作家，如果在一篇作品裏掩去了他的名字，我們便倒過去把他和文壇敗類『視同仁』，這雖不會使高明的作者因此而灰心，然而在旁觀者看來，總不免有些惘然的。</p>
<h3 id="c255">「非難」與「幽默」以外 <a href="#c255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— 進之</p>
<p>據錢歌川先生說，他們介紹基本英語的動機是在於「環境也不許我們全然抛棄英語」見九月三日自由談錢作英語簡易化與基本英語一文）。這告白比說基本英語是新的國際語要老實得多，同時也動聽得多。爲了實用，說乾脆些爲了要在這社會裏混飯吃，我們得懂英語，而英語又是那麽難，現在虧錢先生們給介紹了八百五十字的基本英語，旣省了我們的時間精力，又省了混飯吃的本錢，夠多麽好？</p>
<p>但可惜事實上，基本英語也不切於實用。譬如說，學了基本英語去當西崽就一定會給老　回出來，因爲普通菜單裏的名字，基本英語八百五十字裏就沒有。若說去拉黄包車或做電車賣票，則只要會說「立克夏」？Ｒｉｃｋｓｂａ？）「愛脫拷潑司」（Ｅｉｇｈｔｃｏｐｅｒｓ）或懂得大馬路呌南京路，同孚路呌「野茨路」（Ｙａｔｒｅｓｒｏａｄ）也就夠了，又何貴乎基本英語？</p>
<p>這且不說。基本英語的特點是字彙特别小。許多動詞都用幾個很簡單的字來代替。例如Ｒｉｄｃ可代以ｔｏｇｏｏｎａｎｏｒｓｅ。這粗看固然很好，用不着多記生字。其實不然，因爲我們中國人學基本英語，無論如何「等於學另一外國語」，ｔｏｇｏｏｎａｈｏｒｓｅ這幾個個别的字，學了基本英語固然都懂了，但這一整個的表現法（Ｅｘｐｌａｎｔｉｏｎ）可就等於一個生字，須得學者去記憶的，否則臨用時你就不會用。這是一點。</p>
<p>學基本英語是爲了實用丨與英美　士交接。但在這様的實用時也會發生困難。因爲很多普通的英國語，基本英語裏都沒有，這迫得要使英國人或美國人和學過基本英語的人講話時，忘記很多他所常用的字與表現法。而那些字應該忘記，還得大費周章。這是第二點。</p>
<p>很多人担心基本英語的八百五十字一定不夠用，留聲機一定要說「一個個磨光的黑色圓圈，中畫一只狗在一喇叭之前」。但錢先生告訴我們這是「假設引證，以亂聽聞」，因爲基本英語還有後門好出，還有所謂「國際通用字」。</p>
<p>假使基本英語的拼音是有規則的，則我們讀得出「德律風」這個音，一定可以寫得出它的字，寫作Ｔｅｌｅｆｏｎ，但我們却被强迫要寫爲Ｔｅｌｅｐｈｏｎｅｏ所以我們還得有腦筋，熟讀好幾千的「國際通用字」。至此我們方知所謂八百五十字者不過是一塊招牌。此其三。</p>
<p>不過錢先生說得好：「Ｅｓｐｅｒａｎｔｏ與英語，各有短長，各有園地」俗語所謂「河水不犯井水」，「橋歸橋，路歸路」。所以我覺得「Ｅｓｐｅｒａｎｔｏ同志的非難，林語堂先生的幽默，」都大可不必。就是我這篇拙作，也是廢話。難道你們當眞要使書店的資本，錢歌川先生們的才學都「無用武之地」嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c256">六朝戀歌中的雙關格 <a href="#c256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>六朝戀歌有郭茂倩樂府詩集卷四十四至四十九淸商曲辭的結　，其中常有雙關語，現代中國研究　　修辭格最詳細的約有四家茲依次述其結果如次：</p>
<p>（一）徐嘉瑞的中古文學槪論　稱爲「廋詞」。第二編第四章第四節專論之。他舉出：（一）布匹代匹偶，（二）絲代思，（三）芙蓉代夫容，（四）蓮代憐，（五）梧子代吾子，（六）題代啼，（七）碑代悲，（八）情代琴，（九）結帶代結心，（一○）藕代偶，（一一）桐代同，（一二）梅代媒。第三節中還說到（一三）蹄代啼。此外黄蘖和黄蓮之與苦，我以爲不是隱喻。像下面兩個例黄蘖向春生，苦心隨日長」和「合散無黄蓮，此事復何苦，」明明都是把「苦」字舉出來的，何嘗是把「苦」字隱去呢？第十一，十二兩點也很勉强，所以後來的三家，都不曾舉這四點。這本書在一九二四年出版，要算是最早的了</p>
<p>（二）徐中舒的六朝戀歌載一九二七年的一般雜誌，稱爲「諧音辭格」新增的有：（一四）堤代啼，（一五）油代由，（一六）星代心，（一七）關門代關心，（一八）髻代計，（一九）棋代期，（二Ｏ）籬代離，（二一）藩代分，（二二）博代薄，（二三）荻代敵，（二四）箭代見，（二五）風之流代風流。</p>
<p>（三）陸侃如馮沅君的中國詩史一九三一年版。亦稱「庚詞」。新增的有：（二六）消融代消瘦，（二七）明亮代原亮，（二八）龍骨代人骨。</p>
<p>（四）陳望道的修辭學發凡一九三二年版。稱爲「雙關格」。見卷上第五篇第七節。新增的有：（二九）道路代道說，（三Ｏ）苦味代苦情。最後一條，陳氏之說是比徐氏的學生楊正邦所記的要更爲合理。</p>
<p>我偶檢樂府詩集，以爲讀歌第三首「紅藍」是代替「紅男」的，（俗語本有「紅男緑女」的話）不知是否？</p>
<h3 id="c257">女人（十二） <a href="#c257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— 沈從文</p>
<p>女的想起了自己來此本不願意另外還有人知道她的打算了，她實極不願意人家知道她是ＸＸ總長的小姐，她尤其不願意想傍近她的男子，知道她是個遺產百萬的承繼人。現在被問到時，她一時不易回答，就把手搖着，且笑着，不許男的詢問。且說</p>
<p>「勞山好地方，你不歡喜嗎？」</p>
<p>「我怕寂寞。」</p>
<p>「寂寞也有寂寞的好處，牠使人明白許多平常所不明白的事情。但不是年靑人需要的，人」</p>
<p>年紀輕輕的時節，只要得是熱閙生活，不會在寂寞中發現什麽的。」</p>
<p>「你様子像南方人，言語像北方人。」</p>
<p>「我的感情呢，什麽都不像。」</p>
<p>「我似乎在什麽地方看過你。」</p>
<p>「這是句紳士說的話，紳士看到什麽女人，想同她要好一點時，就那麽說，其實他們在過」</p>
<p>去任何一時皆并不見到，他那句話意思也不過是說『我同你熟了』或『看你使人舒服』罷了。你是不是這意思？」</p>
<p>男的有點羞怯了，把手去抓取身邊小石子，奮力向海中擲去，要說什麽又不好說，不敢說。其實他記憶若好一點，就能夠說得出他在某種盡報上看到過她的相片。但他如今一時却想不起。女的希望他活潑點，自由點，於是又說：</p>
<p>「我們應當成爲很好的朋友！你說，我是怎麽様一種人？」</p>
<p>男的說：</p>
<p>「我不知道你是怎麽様身分的人，但你實在是個美人！」</p>
<p>聽到這種不文雅的讚美，女的却并不感覺怎様難堪。其實他不必說出來，她就知道她的美　早已把這孩子眼目迷亂了。這時她正躺着，四肢匀稱柔和，她穿的原是一件浴衣，浴衣外面再罩了一件白色薄綢短褂。這短褂落水時已弄濕，緊緊的貼着身體，各處襞縐着。她這時便坐了起來，開始脫去那件短褂，擰去了水，掉到身邊有太陽處去。短褂脫掉後，這女人發育合度的肩背與手臂，以及那個緊束在浴衣中典型的胸脯，皆收入了男子的眼底。</p>

<h3 id="c258">在颶風中 <a href="#c258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— 天方</p>
<p>陰沉沉的天氣，呼呼的風，淅淅的雨，不息地吹着下着。亂雲在人頭上颭動，太陽不露一些光。江海　上放着警燈，掛起了黑色的警球。黃浦江中捲起了濁浪，捲去了江中一切大的小的汽笛的狂呌聲，船隻多邊靠着邊悄悄地停着；江邊的樹發狂似地搖擺着，像要乘風飛去似的。熱閙的外灘，平日穿梭似的船隻，穿梭似的車馬，這時三三兩兩，零落不堪，頓成了一個凄風冷雨的世界。馬路中間往來的人們沉沉的臉各像蒙上了一層巨大的心事似的匆匆地走着；這是颶風將來臨的前夜。</p>
<p>眞的，人們對於這大自然的可怖景象的威脅，會全失去了自主的力！當你在黄浦江邊走着時，濁浪不息地向岸上打來，强烈的風夾着沙沙的雨，從四面發來，將你裹住，使你舉足不得，呼吸不得，這時你眼見的是陰雲，波浪，耳聽的是風聲，雨聲，一切外來的威脅，使你整個的情緒墮入了恐怖的深淵，像一葉失去了拕的小舟，而迫着不逃避。</p>
<p>颶風勢是更烈了，耳邊所聽到的是撞在牆壁上的回聲，像是預備把一切建築物都毁滅掉的様子。一般人都担心着未來的恐怖，昻首問天，這陰霾幾時可以開晴？然而大文台上的技士是知道的，他可以告訴我們，這個颶風每小時可以走幾里，幾時才能離開我們，而無絲毫猶豫。丨丨是的，颶風是不免要來的，來了也不會不去的。</p>
<p>但自然界的颶風，遭害雖列，而其成因簡單，爲期是短暫的，還可以使人忍受。祇有在歷史進化中政治的經濟的颶風，雖前進的方向一如氣象的可以預知，而也有解决與預防的方法，但原因較爲複雜，爲期也稍長，那便不是一般人所能忍受的了。而其爲害也就比自然界的颶風爲烈。</p>
<p>現時代的靑年正如在颶風中的般人一様，在經濟的政治的激盪之下，對於陰霾的展開，因有望不到，等不及的種種緣故，有的是被呑沒了，有的是逃避了，有的是彷徨着，能抱着鎭靜的態度來對付這一颶風，像天文學者對自然界的颶風觀察一様，更用此觀察的結果，丨丨成因與趨勢丨丨以尋求解决的途徑，實在少有。</p>
<p>這裏，我們可以說一句：中國現時沒有敎育！一九三三，九，二，暴風之夜寫。</p>
<h3 id="c259">颶風 <a href="#c259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— 一蘋</p>
<p>蔚藍的天空，一望無際的接着廣潤的田疇，靑風輕輕地拂來，河邊倒埀的楊柳，將靜止的水面揮成陣陣的漣漪。佈榖鳥飛過天空，喊着「家家佈榖」靑天，空氣中充滿着愉快的精神。都巿裏的公子小姐們，輕移他的貴體，也踏到經濟破產的農村，欽賞大自然的美景；然而終年勞働而不能養活一家的阿祥哥，這時候，正捋起了褲管，舉着鋤頭，</p>
<p>矮寇豈亦有份　大　抗議抗議法中</p>
<p>翻鬆田中的泥塊，像牛一様；可是他的牛爲了去年的榖賤，已變賣給東村上的保正。對於這美麗的賜與，他是沒有幸福享受的，他要像牛一般的工作。播種，挿秧，分秧，從天明至日落。美麗的靑天，在他幸勞的工作中箭一般的飛走了。接着浩日當空的夏天，但是麥塲上綠葉成陰，蟬在上面刮噪，坐在底下喝酒拉山海經也是滿樂意的，做農夫的沒有這福份啦！阿祥哥春天工作的收穫，望着寸把長的秧，想拉開嘴笑；老天却沒有下過雨，每天伊啞伊啞的車水，這條貫通東西兩村的小河，已淺了許多，而兩村幾百畝的田，還在儘量的吸取，再十天半月不落雨，眼見又是旱災。阿祥哥望着寸把長的秧，皺起在嘴角邊的微笑溜走了。一幕賣牛的悲劇却騙出他兩滴淸涙。</p>
<p>是去年冬天，雪花飛舞的一個早晨。妻抖顫在薄被中，沒有衣服穿，甕中也不見米粒了。阿祥哥正預備到東村去借點米，一乘大轎同保正到他的門口來，是田主陸大爺親自到鄕催租了。這村裏的農夫，都是陸大爺的佃户，去年雖是大豐年，可是每担榖只値五塊錢，到倉中完租的時候都沒有淸賬，約着到年底一定歸還陸大爺的；這是鄕下人希望僅存的幾担榖，能夠上價的救星。看看年底到了，榖價愈賤，阿祥哥在上半年死去他的母親，喪葬醫藥等費，一個拚手抵足的窮農夫，那裏來的餘錢，更負了一點債，所以這時候，他家中滴榖無賸了。他見陸大爺同着保正親自下鄕，知道再沒有抵賴的餘地，就偷偷地把牛變賣了，完淸租糧。</p>
<p>這一個夏天，他祗能靠自己的兩條腿車水了。惟恐這小河裏的水，不夠兩村幾百畝田的灌漑，就日夜工作，脚底上滿是水泡，不敢休息。每夜觀望星斗，老不見下雨的預兆。當然，東西兩村的農夫，都愁眉不展。去年大半年，還是變賣的變賣，上當的上當，今年如其再旱災，兩村的人將流爲難民了。然而天是下了雨，碧綠的秧已纍纍地結上穗了，阿祥哥滿歡喜的放下一顆沉重的心。</p>
<p>這天夜半，他被巨大的響聲驚醒過來，一陣陣駭人的颶風從屋頂吹過，房屋的四壁都被震動，屋頂也像要吹去似的格格的響。阿祥哥抖顫在破被中不敢探出頭來，似乎附近像壓塌了房子的大哭小喊。他整個的心中盤旋着的是别把自己惟一的住所犧牲在風潮之中，他的妻子已駭極哭出聲來，牆上掛着的農具掉下來的時候都發生巨大的聲音，呼，呼，一陣陣駭人的颶風僅在屋頂吹過，惴惴的夫妻倆一夜沒有好睡。</p>
<p>然而更怕人的事在後面，第二天附近當然塌了許多草屋，阿祥哥想到東村去望望他的岳家，踏出門來，一望無際的田稻，都倚臥在田中，他像跌進了黑暗的深淵，兩眼注視着他春夏以來千辛萬苦所獲的纍纍結穗，病人似的倚臥着……</p>

<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>第二幕　逃亡之羣</p>
<p>少爺：沒有這様的事，我這個人是最有良心的。不信，我這一世就不娶媳婦給你看。</p>
<p>姨太太：别說了，我就不愛聽這些。我們兩人始終不能一生一世的守在一道，即使我　沒有嫁你的爸爸，你也不是我理想中的丈夫。什麽呀，我們還是高興玩的時候就玩一會兒罷，說得那末遠幹嗎？能說不能做又有什麽用呢？</p>
<p>少　　又是　　二套　，爲什麽老使人掃興的？難道你　不是眞心愛我嗎？</p>
<p>姨太太：我爲什麽不是眞心愛你呢？不過我什麽事情都看穿啦，還是做到那裏說到那裏罷。</p>
<p>（一聲汽笛，驚醒了這娘兒們的迷夢。）</p>
<p>少爺：可糟，汽笛又在呌，她們還不來。</p>
<p>姨太太：我想現在總該來了吧。</p>
<p>勤務兵：少爺！（從飲食間門内進來，後面跟着站長。）我現在請站長來了，那個事請你和他當面交涉罷。</p>
<p>站長：寳眷還沒有到齊嗎？我們已經等了許久。（看手表。）本來這一次車是十點二十分鐘開的，現在已是十點三刻了。</p>
<p>少爺：對不起，對不起，請坐。</p>
<p>站長：不客氣。少爺有什麽事要商量？</p>
<p>少爺：有點兒小事。要站長親自過來，眞是對不起得很。我們師部裏的副官說，這是節車是我們包了的，不知爲什麽那邊有一個女眷坐在裏面去了。</p>
<p>站長：是剛才來的嗎？</p>
<p>少爺：（向勤務兵，）是剛才來的嗎？</p>
<p>勤務兵：來了有一會兒。</p>
<p>站長：哦！我想起來了。本來我想親自來和大少爺商量的，可是爲了那些難民儘在那兒閙麻煩，所以就敎那一個查票員帶她來的。那是省政府王科長的太太；（低聲）突然跑來問我們要座位，我一時沒有法子可想。頭等位子，都是預定了的，二等她又不坐，而且并沒有空位子。所以我便請她在你們挿一下。因爲你們寳眷不多，車子又大。請大少爺包涵包涵。你知道，科長的太太，旣然來了，我總不能不給她一點兒面子。哈哈，對吧。</p>
<p>少爺；不過，站長！這一節車你旣然包給我了，你就不好，……哈哈，是吧。</p>
<p>站長；錯是不錯。可是眞沒有辦法，總還得少爺特别原諒。···！遇到這様的事，眞是沒有辦法。你想，外面全擠滿了難民，都是從前綫逃來的。可是車又不夠，而且他們又多半是沒有錢買票的。他們一定要搭車，你看這還成道理麽？</p>
<p>少爺：是的是的。</p>
<p>站長：，大家都要搭車，又不買票，這還成話？像這様下去，政府的鐵道收入，不是一個大錢也不想收嗎？…</p>
<p>所以我現在還要去開導他們一頓。…我不陪了，大少爺請坐。</p>
<p>少爺：請便請便。不過那個……怎麽辦呢？</p>
<p>姨太太：我看就讓她坐着罷，大家都是面子上幾個人。</p>
<p>站長：是的呀！眞是……</p>
<p>少爺：謝謝，謝謝！少爺特别帮忙。（走出門，又回頭。）那些東西，眞是不懂道理。啼啼哭哭，大聲喊呌，簡直，閙得不成様子，眞把我氣死了。替國家，辦事眞難啊，任勞任怨，！···好，大少爺再見罷。（握手下）。</p>

<p>(Beiping) Zhangbei Telegram. Ji Hongchang led over 2,000 troops from Xianaobao last night, arriving at Naobao, 20 li within Zhangbei County. He sent his Director Sun to Ertaizi to negotiate with Song, willing to have Song send personnel to receive his troops. Ji himself would be funded by the government for overseas travel, currently under negotiation. On the evening of the third, Song issued an order notifying Zhang Yunrong, Gao Shuxun, Zhang Lingyun, Ruan Xuanwu, Lei Zhongtian, and other generals to search for and completely eliminate the remnants of Ji's army in Shangdu, so as not to disturb the people. (Fourth Daily Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Guihua Telegram. Zhao Chengshou is stationed in Pingdiquan, working at the station. He has ordered three regiments of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, as well as the First Brigade, to be stationed at the junction of Chahar and Suiyuan, strictly preventing Ji's troops from fleeing westward.

<p>Song Ziwen Arrives at Lushan Yesterday</p>

<h3 id="e3">Central Government Figures to Discuss Financial Issues at Lushan <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Sun Ke and Song Ziwen arrived safely in Jiujiang today and immediately took a car to Lianhua Cave to ascend Lushan. Telegrams have already arrived. Wang Jingwei, Li Shizeng, Wu Zhihui, Zhang Jingjiang, Chen Shaokuan, Tang Youren, and Zeng Zhongming all left Nanjing for Jiangxi today, one after another. Li Shizeng originally planned to go to Lushan with Song Ziwen, but because of private matters in Wuhu, he took the British ship Wusong this morning to Wuhu and arranged to meet with Song and others in Wuhu to sail west on the same ship. After Wang, Wu, and Zhang boarded the ship, Wu Zhihui told visitors, "1) I am going to Lushan this time to accompany them to talk, not to attend. 2) I am not very clear about the Sino-American cotton and wheat loan. It is said that it amounts to about 200 million Chinese dollars. This amount is really small and not worth much attention. For example, our Jiangsu Province has 40 million mu of farmland. If we are not careful, we will lose one dan per mu, which is 40 million dan, worth 800 million yuan. If we are careful ourselves, everything is inside. My hope for this loan is that not a single penny will be wasted. 3) I am not very clear about the reorganization of the Jiangsu Provincial Government. The current government is like a small temple. We hope that not doing bad things is much better than doing good things. 4) There is no need to worry about the navy. If we take out tens of millions of dollars to build it, we will have our cruisers in the Atlantic Ocean." Zhang Jingjiang said, "The Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway has been largely completed and has been partially open to traffic for some time. By February of next year, the JinHua-Yushan section of the project will be completely built and fully open to traffic." Wang Jingwei arrived at the dock at 2:45 PM. Chen Bijun, Tang Youren, Zeng Zhongming, Chen Shaokuan, Chu Minyi, and others boarded the Shanghai Rong warship, and military music was played loudly (19-gun salute). After Wang boarded the ship, he planned to send a telegram to Li Shizeng, stating that he would arrive in Wuhu this afternoon and asking him to come to the ship to travel together. The telegram was sent by the Navy Department's radio station. Chen Bijun and Chu Minyi disembarked at 3:20 PM and departed. They are expected to arrive in Xunzhou at Shenshi (3-5 PM) on the fifth. They will return to Nanjing in about four or five days in Lushan. (Fourth Daily Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Xunzhou Telegram. Sun Ke did not ascend the mountain on the fourth and will ascend the mountain on the fifth. (Fourth Daily Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang talked before going to Xunzhou. The issues to be discussed at the Lushan conference will focus on finance and the distribution of cotton and wheat loans. Diplomatic issues will also be discussed. The conference is expected to last from five to seven days. He should be able to return to attend the Administrative Yuan meeting next Monday. Although funding for the Yellow River management has been allocated from the surplus funds for flood control in the Yangtze River, it is still insufficient. It has not been decided whether a portion can be allocated from the US cotton and wheat loans. As for the issue of giving Feng Yuxiang a title, he has not heard anything about it. As for Ambassador Jiang Zuobin, he will be able to return to his post soon. (Fourth Daily Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Gongbo said that after the Minister of Finance Song returned to the capital, he had a private discussion with him about the distribution of US cotton and wheat.

Kong said that the main points of discussion at the Lushan conference would roughly be to discuss domestic financial distribution, cotton and wheat loans, and the direction of League of Nations technical cooperation, with finance being the priority. The duration of the conference will depend on the length of the discussion and the number of issues. (Fourth Daily Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Minister of Finance Song returned to the country, various key figures in the central government urgently wanted to discuss diplomatic and financial issues in detail in order to deal with them. It was decided to meet in Lushan. Those who have gone to Lushan successively in recent days include Sun Ke, Song Ziwen, Wu Tiecheng, Kong Xiangxi, and Zou Lin. Wang Jingwei specially took the Hai Rong warship to Xunzhou on the afternoon of the fourth, accompanied by Wu Zhihui, Zhang Jingjiang, Tang Youren, and Chen Shaokuan. Li Shizeng took a ship on the morning of the fourth. Huang Fu is expected to rush from Shanghai in the next few days. Now that the government authorities and veteran party members have gathered in Kuanglu, there will definitely be broad significance for the promotion of future government affairs. Because Wang urgently needed to go to Lushan, the regular meeting of the Executive Yuan on the fifth was brought forward to the morning of the fourth. In addition to discussing routine cases, he also reported on his mission to Lushan. Wang told reporters after the meeting that this trip to Lushan was to meet with Chiang and Song to discuss central finance and the use and distribution of US cotton and wheat loans, which is expected to take about a week to return. According to Tang Youren, the scope of the Lushan conference is extremely broad, and opinions will be exchanged on all issues. Regarding diplomacy, only Song's report will be listened to. Since Wang was preparing to take a warship to Xunzhou, Chen Shaokuan ordered the Hai Rong warship, which was anchored on the Jianggan on the morning of the fourth, to fire up and prepare to depart. At 1 PM, Chen arrived at the ship to arrange the preparations and returned to Wang's residence to report. In addition to the naval guards guarding the route, the police department also temporarily dispatched police to densely deploy posts upon receiving the news at 2:40 PM. Central Committee members Zhang Jingjiang and Wu Zhihui boarded the ship together. According to Li Shijia, the Hai Rong warship will arrive in Xunzhou at 5 PM on the fifth. Wang telegraphed Li Shizeng, who had taken the Wusong ship on the morning of the fourth, asking him to wait for him in Wuhu so that they could go to Xunzhou on the same ship. The telegram was handed over to Li Shijia to be sent to Wuhu by the Navy's wireless telegraph. (Fourth Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>Yin and Liu Will Explain to the Japanese Side</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a report by the Japanese Dentsu News Agency, the Japanese side rejected our side's sending troops into the counties of the war zone to suppress bandits. According to relevant sources, this is not true. When we first contacted the Japanese side, both the Japanese Kwantung Army and the Garrison Army hoped that our side would quickly send troops into the war zone to carry out suppression operations and had no objection. The Japanese report may be a misunderstanding. The bandit situation is now rampant in various counties, and a small number of troops may not be effective. At a minimum, about two divisions must be sent in to carry out a large-scale suppression. Yu Xuezhong will return to Beiping in the next few days to decide on implementation. The Japanese side has not yet responded to the issue of receiving the Yuguan. Liu Shisun is scheduled to go to Tianjin tonight to negotiate. (Fourth Daily Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Xi'an) Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan telegraphed Shao Lizhi on the 2nd, requesting that the Shaanxi Provincial Government advance 300,000 yuan for flood relief. Shao convened provincial committee members on the morning of the 3rd to discuss the matter. As a result, it was decided to follow Wang's telegram and have Finance Director Ning Shengshan be responsible for discussing advance payment methods with the Provincial Bank and the Chamber of Commerce. It was decided to advance funds as much as possible within a reasonable range. Furthermore, considering that the counties along the Jing and Wei Rivers in the province suffered significant losses in this flood, providing relief only to the Yellow River banks would be unfair. It was decided to telegraph Wang, requesting permission for unified relief. As for relief methods, work relief is more beneficial than emergency relief. It was decided to allocate one-fifth for emergency relief and four-fifths for work relief in principle.

<p>Chen Gongbo: Recent Situation in North China</p>
<p>Ding Weifen: Yellow River Flood Disaster</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held its 94th Commemorative Week at 8:00 AM on the 4th. Central Committee members Li Ciwen, Zhu Jiahua, Xie Zuomin, Ju Zheng, Xiao Jishan, Chen Gongbo, Li Jingzhai, Chen Lifu, Gu Zhenggang, Wang Qi, Li Zonghuang, Hong Ludong, Zhang Weicun, Xiao Zhongzhen, Miao Peicheng, and all staff members were present. Ju Zheng presided. Chen Gongbo reported on the recent general situation in North China and the situation of the rural experimental counties. He said that the general situation in North China can be divided into war zones and non-war zones. Security issues in the war zones and other post-war issues are difficult to address. The central and local authorities should pay close attention to prevent the Luan East area from becoming another Northeast. The economic power of the non-war zones, such as Qingdao, is under the influence of foreigners. Special measures should be planned for popular movements and organizations in such places. He has inspected rural experimental counties such as Ding County in Hebei. Regardless of the results, the more such experimental counties there are in China, the better. He only expresses sympathy for this and does not wish to criticize. In the future, rural surveys should establish a national rural survey organization, and he hopes the government will pay attention to this. (4th Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held a Commemorative Week on the morning of the 4th. Chairman Lin, Yu Youren, Ding Weifen, Chen Shaokuan, He Yaozu, Li Yuanding, Wei Huai, Lü Chao, and Chairman Lin led the ceremony. Afterwards, Committee Member Ding Weifen reported on the Yellow River breach, stating that the affected provinces include Jiangsu, Henan, Shandong, and Hebei, with forty or fifty affected counties and approximately 18 million affected people. The disaster is the worst in decades. The breaches are in Changyuan, Dongming, and Lanfeng, with the most severe flooding in Lanfeng. The rivers from all three breaches flow towards Shandong, turning the northwest of Shandong into a swamp. Approximately 2 million people are affected in Shandong Province. Shandong Province usually pays close attention to preventing Yellow River floods, but has suffered greatly, which is regrettable. The central government has now allocated 4 million yuan to relieve the disaster victims in the entire region. It is planned to raise more funds to manage the Yellow River so that the people of all provinces will no longer suffer from it. (4th Central News Agency)</p>

<h3 id="e24">The Road Ahead for China's Economic Revival <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>After the failure of the World Economic Conference, countries are increasingly trending toward implementing economic nationalism. They are both striving to open up domestic markets and developing overseas trade with all their energy. In other words, they are raising tariffs to protect their domestic manufactures and, on the other hand, encouraging exports to increase prices. Thus, the world's so-called international cooperation has become a mere empty name and is, in reality, extremely the opposite. Countries rich in resources, such as the United States and the Soviet Union, may be able to strive for "self-sufficiency." Although Britain's situation is scattered, its command capabilities are strong. By uniting all the British dominions and colonies around the world into an economic alliance of the British Empire, it can still be compared with the United States and the Soviet Union. However, Japan in the East and Germany in Western Europe are truly unable to achieve self-sufficiency. Yet, they are also strongly advocating a self-sufficient economy, merely relying on military relations to勉自支撑the current situation, using diligent efforts to seek distant strategies to conceal their current flaws.</p>
<p>At this time, our country is experiencing the active aggression of strong neighbors, transitioning from bloodless economic struggle to fierce military invasion. Economically, our national economy is only in the process of development. All organizations are more immature than those in advanced countries. Military equipment, whether land, sea, or air forces, is unable to cope with modern three-dimensional warfare. Moreover, the sustaining power and decisive point of modern warfare should be based on the entire economic system. Only with the power of economic struggle can one engage in international struggle. For more than twenty years, from the government to the people of the Republic of China, we have been hampered by ingrained habits and have never possessed the determination to advance boldly. Therefore, we have not had the positive action to break this adverse environment of economic aggression.</p>
<p>Recently, the National Economic Council, in view of the current tense world situation, advocated expanding the existing organizations as much as possible. Experts should manage matters such as rural areas, water conservancy, transportation, electricity, and sanitation. Not only those who are enthusiastic about construction are full of hope for this, but also the declining national fortune will generate an opportunity for recovery. Therefore, we specifically put forward the three items of rural areas, water conservancy, and transportation, on the one hand, to arouse the attention of the Chinese people, and on the other hand, to contribute our humble views to the authorities. The development of China's rural economy in its handicraft industry period has reached its peak, and the diligence of the people engaged in agriculture is also renowned in the world. However, in the past century, as a result of the development of capitalism, China's rural areas have suffered a great disaster. They have not only suffered the invisible erosion of cheap commodities but have also been obviously excluded from the international market. The population is concentrated in cities, agricultural production is declining, and various unexpected domestic conflicts are arising. In the future, if rural issues such as usury and land problems are not properly resolved, not only will the suppression of bandits become a problem, but also general personnel administration may be difficult to stabilize for a while. Therefore, to reverse China's misfortune, the only key is to stabilize rural order and revive the rural economy.</p>
<p>The disasters in our country today, the lack of human planning, are indeed an important component. Natural disasters are also a major current harm. Among natural disasters, floods are the most serious. The harm of the Yellow River is undeniable. The Yangtze River basin, which is known for its prosperity, has also suffered from floods recently. The source of the disaster lies in the failure to repair ditches and manage waterways. We know that the Yellow River 套裏flooding is due to the embankments in the east, which provide irrigation benefits. The fertile land of the Chengdu Plain is due to the power of the Dujiangyan irrigation system. Therefore, the key to water conservancy lies in repairing ditches and dredging rivers, guiding them according to the terrain. Then, today's turbulent flow can carry boats and irrigate fields in the future.</p>
<p>In recent times, transportation tools have become increasingly developed. Ships and trains seem to be behind the times and are no longer the most important tools in the transportation industry. Aviation is certainly in the first place in military affairs, and in general transportation, airplanes are also the first. It is undeniable that our country, known as an ancient country, has backward industries. Developing the aviation industry is truly a shortcut to "catch up." However, economic construction and the foundation of heavy industry are also essential. In advanced European and American countries, aviation has been added after ships and trains have been fully developed. Its momentum is smooth, and its operation is convenient. In our country, the north-south railway lines of Jinpu and Pinghan only extend to half their length. From east to west, Longhai only reaches the border of Shaanxi. The central region relies solely on the Yangtze River. If we rely solely on the development of aviation, we cannot transport coal and steel by plane. Even automobile transportation cannot achieve the effect of carrying heavy loads over long distances. Therefore, completing the Longhai Road to Dihua and connecting the Yuehan Road is an urgent matter for the transportation industry. Furthermore, it is necessary to build the Chuanhan Road to Kangding so that the capital and the border areas are no longer separated. If this kind of transportation plan is truly realized, the people will benefit, the government will reap the benefits, and economic revival will also be able to fully utilize these tools to develop the future prosperity of our country.</p>

<p>Sir Archibald Clark Kerr's Brief Biography</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the British government previously proposed to our country that Sir Archibald Clark Kerr succeed Sir Miles Lampson as the British envoy to China, and our government has already expressed its agreement. It is now learned that Sir Kerr was born on November 25, 1884. In 1909, he was dispatched to Constantinople to serve in the Turkish capital. In 1910, he was promoted to Third Secretary. In 1912, he was transferred back to the British Foreign Office. In 1913, he was appointed to Vienna in Austria. In 1914, when Britain declared war on Austria, Sir Kerr left Austria and returned to the British Foreign Office. From 1919 to 1928, he successively served as Private Secretary to Member of Parliament Hamsworth, First Secretary, Acting Counselor, British Foreign Office Counselor, and Undersecretary of the Foreign Office. He was also awarded the (CMG) and (BB) medals in 1926 and 1932 respectively. This time as envoy to China, he should be able to further strengthen the amicable relations between China and Britain.

<p>(London) Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, Counselor of the British Foreign Office, was formally appointed as the British envoy to China on the 3rd. Sir Kerr is scheduled to attend the League of Nations Council meeting in September and will assume his new post in China this year.

<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Army Ministry claims that there are now over 5,000 kilometers of double-track railways in Manchuria. No damage was caused in August of this year. Last August, the tracks were damaged by "bandits" in 170 incidents. The year before last September was even more severe, with 350 incidents. On this day last year, there were no fewer than 210,000 "bandits" in Manchuria. This year, the number has been reduced to 100,000, and they are small, unconnected groups without political character. According to responsible sources, the "Manchukuo" government and the Japanese authorities have decided to establish a labor allocation agency to provide work for surrendered "bandits" in order to eliminate the "bandit" problem.

<p>Plans to Ask Congress for Broad Powers</p>
<p>To Deal with Disarmament, Adjust Tariffs, and Resolve War Debts</p>
<p>Resumption of Relations with Russia Can Be Achieved This Year</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, reliable sources revealed that the US President plans to ask Congress to legislate, granting the same broad powers over foreign affairs as over domestic affairs. These broad powers will include concluding reciprocal agreements, adjusting tariffs, restoring diplomatic and trade relations with Russia, signing disarmament agreements with other countries, and resolving war debts.</p>
<p>It is heard that this proposal was initially put forward by members of Congress because they wanted to avoid amending tariffs by the plenary session. It is reported that several members of Congress have told the President that they believe the time has passed for a simple, rigid tariff bill that specifies tax rates and applies equally to countries trading with the United States. President Roosevelt also believes that commercial treaties should consider disarmament, war debts, and other international issues that have a direct or indirect impact on commerce. Senators have discussed the aforementioned proposal, and it is heard that if the President makes this request, he will encounter very little opposition in the Senate. However, in the House, there may still be hesitation to give up the power to formulate taxes, especially the power over tariffs. A senator stated today that the President is now preparing to negotiate a commercial and friendship treaty with Russia. If this treaty can be carried out simultaneously with the promotion of commercial activities, it is expected that few diehards will oppose it. According to this plan of the US President, it can be seen that the resumption of relations with Russia may not be realized before next spring. It is also heard that the President has formulated a concrete plan for adjusting tariffs with various countries, which will allow countries that agree to significantly reduce their armaments to gain greater market share in the United States. This week, the President will consult with Secretary of State Hull and Secretary of the Treasury Woodin on these issues. (3rd National News)</p>

<p>Hitler's Speech Emphasizes Racial Issues</p>
<p>Cites Natural Selection as an Inflexible Law</p>
<p>Vows to Fight for National Survival</p>
<p>Nuremberg The National Socialist Party Congress closed last night. The impression gained from Hitler's important speech was the same as previously, that the issue of race is of utmost concern to the Hitler Party. This speech by Mr. Hitler is the essence of the National Socialist philosophy, the foundation of which is the National Socialist Party's biological natural selection theory." The second principle of Mr. Hitler's philosophy, that the authority of one person governs the masses, can also be seen in this speech. Mr. Hitler narrated the history of the principle of authority, saying that there was authority in the era of primitive humans. For example, people must force animals to obey human will and initially abandon their free lives without seeking the animals' consent. His conclusion discussed Germany's mission to the world, saying, "We must preserve the bloodline that we are endowed with by nature. Then, we can guide the diseases that are prevalent among various nations and prevent them. If Western and Central Europe are poisoned by extremism, the most ancient and beautiful countries of civilization will also be affected. Therefore, our struggle for Germany is fulfilling our responsibility to Europe. Germany has always fulfilled this responsibility in history." (4th Havas)</p>

<p>Nuremberg Today, more than 100,000 members of the National Socialist Party Stormtroopers paraded past Hitler with their bare hands and saluted him. Hitler stood in a car in the old city market. It took three hours to complete. The windows on both sides of the street were filled with people waiting for the passing parade. Hitler presented new flags to each team. The new flags were all in contact with the blood flag from the failed Munich uprising in 1923. At that time, a company of the National Defense Force's artillery fired a 101-gun salute. Hitler addressed the parade, saying that the world should not regard this spectacle as an expression of seeking glory on new battlefields, because Germans know that no future war can obtain the same honor as they did in the last war. Therefore, this spectacle is only a great and solemn recognition of German unity. (3rd Reuters)</p>
<p>Nuremberg The last day of the National Socialist Party Congress was entirely military in nature. At 8:00 AM, Chancellor Hitler reviewed the flags of the National Socialist Party's various teams, naming the deceased soldiers of each team one by one and awarding their flags to the newly formed teams, giving them simple instructions. At 11:00 AM, the teams began the parade, walking past Hitler. Each soldier wore a backpack but had no weapons. Each row had twelve people, and every forty rows formed a team. Hefe, the leader of the Austrian National Socialist Party who escaped from the Innsbruck prison in Austria, arrived by plane with an injured left leg and sat on the honorary reviewing stand with Hitler to review the troops. Behind the National Socialist Party teams were six motorcycle gun vehicles of the National Defense Force. The soldiers were all dressed in wartime uniforms, and the passersby on the street paid great attention. The organizers of the conference specifically stated that the motorcycle gun vehicles were used to fire salutes and were not part of the parade. (3rd Havas)</p>
<h3 id="e37">Speech by Austrian Chancellor <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Promoting National Unity</p>
<p>Maintaining National Independence and Freedom</p>
<p>Vienna - Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss, in a speech to the Patriotic Assembly today, made it clear that the Austro-Hungarian government intends to apply for permission to implement a compulsory military service system in Austria at the upcoming disarmament conference, as military service is the best method of national education and training. The Austrian Chancellor appealed to young people to enlist in the newly formed auxiliary army, because Austria's future is in danger, and the people should unite and be prepared to shed their last drop of blood so that the country can achieve true freedom and independence. Austria is currently only pursuing a policy of self-defense, and will resist anyone who attempts to interfere in its internal affairs. He hopes Austria will escape the world's misfortunes sooner than other countries, and that Austria does not need to wait four years to succeed, etc. This last remark was a jab at Hitler, who said it would take four years to overcome unemployment.

<h3 id="e38">Fake Draft Trademark Law <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>(Changchun) The "Pseudo-State" Ministry of Industry has now completed the Trademark Law and the Trademark Bureau Organization Law, which will be implemented after being passed by the State Council and the Privy Council.

<h3 id="e39">Fascist Faction in Japan Plots to Overthrow Makino Movement <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Listing Three Major Crimes to Force Resignation</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The movement by the Japanese military and Fascists to exclude Minister of the Interior Makino is becoming increasingly fierce. Recently, the Fascist faction, not content with verbal attacks, has also spread the word that if Count Makino does not resign quickly, the May 15 Incident will be repeated to resolve his life. The reasons for the military and Fascist opposition to Makino are as follows: (1) Makino does not support expanding military preparations, so militarists should succeed to this position. (2) Count Makino uses his position to manipulate the political world, colluding with political parties and financial groups, and destroying the people. (3) The external situation is becoming more and more serious, and Makino is not a hero in troubled times and must step down and give way to the virtuous. The Japanese military and its Fascist faction plan to have the Emperor's relative, Prince Hiroyasu Fushimi, the current Chief of Naval Operations, succeed as Minister of the Interior, with one person holding both positions. According to the Japanese Minister of the Interior system, from its establishment in Meiji 18 to the current Minister of the Interior Makino, the Minister of the Interior has been replaced eight times in forty-nine years. The first generation, Duke Sanjo, and the second generation, Marquis Tokudaiji, were both court nobles. The third generation, Army General Duke Katsura, and the fifth generation, Army General Marshal Duke Oyama, were newly wealthy from military backgrounds. The sixth generation, Marquis Matsukata, the seventh generation, Count Hirata, and the eighth generation, Count Makino, were all meritorious officials of the Meiji government, literati from political backgrounds. Among them, the fourth generation, Prince Sadai, was a relative of the Emperor, the father of the current Chief of Naval Operations. Minister of the Interior Makino, since Nakamura Palace resigned due to the Empress issue in Taisho 10, succeeded as Palace Minister and then transferred to the Imperial Household Ministry until today. The power he has created in the past thirteen years is indeed called the twin peaks with Elder Prince Saionji. The Fascist faction recommends that the Emperor's relative succeed as Head of the Imperial Household Ministry, with the aim of overthrowing Makino and the forces behind him, which is to take the opportunity to overthrow the initial work of the established regime.

<p>The Army Ministry Secretly Studies Ways to Reform Armaments</p>
<p>Planning Countermeasures for the Second Washington Conference</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is now strongly argued that the equipment of the Japanese army is superior or inferior to that of the countries that participated in the European War. In fact, the Sino-Japanese Incident and the Manchurian Incident have revealed many shortcomings that should be corrected. The opposing side believes that the Hua Army and the Righteous Army cannot use this experience as a basis for fundamental reform, but there are many things that need to be improved, such as weapons, ammunition, communication equipment, aircraft, automobiles, fortification, clothing, and food, as well as tactical education. The army headquarters has ordered the dispatch of troops, the Army Technical Headquarters, the Chemical Research Institute, the Fortification Headquarters, the Aviation Headquarters, the Clothing Factory, the Food Factory, various schools, and the General Staff Headquarters to establish a committee system to study it in extreme secrecy. The results have been carefully considered and are being gradually implemented. The military secrets prevent us from announcing the specific improvements that have been made as a result of this research. However, improvements such as the equipment of infantry units, especially cooking equipment, artillery, artillery ammunition, explosives, communication equipment, etc., are enough to boast of the world's new weapons, and many inventions have been made. By October of Showa 13, the Japanese army can complete the improvement of equipment and organization, and create a new look and prepare for power. (Fourth Telegraphic Communication Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry believes that the international situation is gradually becoming unfavorable to Japan. 1935 is the expiration of the Washington-London Naval Treaty, and it is also the time when Japan completely withdraws from the League of Nations. In order to cope with this new situation, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs proposed the establishment of a disarmament countermeasures deliberation council. The Army and Navy have expressed their agreement. It is reported that the members have been decided. The three directors of the European and American, Treaty, and Information Divisions of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well as Secretary Sakamoto, will serve as members. The Navy Ministry has selected Vice Chief of the Naval General Staff Lieutenant General Takahashi, Rear Admirals Hibino, Yoshida, and Shimada, and Captains Iwamura and Noda as members. The Army has sent Vice Chief of Staff Ueda, Rear Admirals Yamaoka, Tojo, Furuzhuang, and Hashimoto, and Captain Yamashita as members. The first meeting will be held this week. It is reported that its main tasks are as follows: (1) Collect military intelligence from various countries, (2) Collect the basis for disarmament proposals and opposition to Japan from various countries, and prepare counter-materials item by item, (3) The Manchurian issue and policy towards China will be the themes of the meeting, and prepare various materials to fight against various countries, (4) Japan's active proposals.

<p>Constructing Forty-Eight New Ships</p>
<p>Increasing Naval Personnel by Ten Thousand</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a report received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today, the British Admiralty announced the following naval expansion plan: (1)</p>
<p>Construct 29 excellent warships, (2) Construct 15 to 18 destroyers every year, (3) Expand the aircraft carriers belonging to the fleet, (4) Increase naval personnel by 10,000, (5) Increase the fuel and training expenses for the fleet. Mr. Corte, a famous journalist who is well-versed in naval affairs in Britain, defended the British position, saying that according to the London Naval Treaty, the amount of warships held by the three countries, Britain, the United States, and Japan, is determined based on the amount held by the United States in 1936. Britain's current shipbuilding plan will not be realized before 1937, so it does not violate the treaty, and most of the cruisers currently owned by Britain will become old ships in the next two years, so it is natural to replenish them. (Fourth Japan United Press)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese naval authorities commented on the British shipbuilding plan, saying that they have not received a reliable report on this news, but since the United States has implemented a large-scale shipbuilding plan, Britain will naturally also plan to build ships. The disarmament conference is about to be held, and it is a pity that countries are competing to build ships, but this makes Japan's second naval replenishment plan even more justified.

<p>Actually Claims to be an Angel</p>
<p>Says Only Japan Can Conquer White People</p>
<p>Reuters Tokyo Dispatch - Nakada, the Japanese church's main teacher, recently published a booklet claiming that Japan is a country that liberates Jews and condemns the League of Nations as the vanguard of anti-Christ. The book cites the chapters of Isaiah in the Old Testament and Revelation as the basis for its theory, saying that the phrase "a nation that you do not know, and a nation that does not know you" in the chapter of the Isaiah army and the seventh chapter of Revelation, "an angel descending from the east, holding the seal of God" all refer to Japan. Nakada's main teacher translated "descending from the east" as "descending from the country of the rising sun" and pointed to Revelation "an angel standing on the four corners of the earth" as the four major races of Anglo-Saxon, Latin, Slavic, and Teuton. Nakada said that this passage can only be regarded as a prophecy of the last great war, the result of which is that the Jews rely on the help of the people of Japan to restore their country, and Japan will repay and stop the warring countries. Nakada further elaborated on his theory, saying that among the five major countries in the world today, Japan is the only one that has never oppressed Jews. Japan has very little contact with Jews, so the chapter of Isaiah is called "a nation that you do not know, and a nation that does not know you". As for the League of Nations, it is a machine that sings peace but has no peace, and will eventually be controlled by one of the anti-Christians. The whole world will now encounter the disasters shown in the Old Testament, but the Jews will suffer the most. Finally, a great country will come out and take on the task of gathering Jews from all over the world and rescuing them. At that time, a world war will break out, and God will use Japan to conquer the white people who have always slaughtered Jews, and send the Jews back to their homeland. This kind of appointment cannot be undertaken by Europeans and Americans, because they have killed Jews. Permanent peace in the world can never be achieved by the artificial barriers of the League of Nations and others. This is the will of heaven. War in the world cannot stop until Japan liberates the Jews by force and realizes the prophecies of the Old Testament, and the golden world cannot come.</p>

The New Provincial Government has always opposed this and has negotiated many times without a solution. Recently, the price of New Provincial official notes has fallen to only one ocean per twenty taels. The postal economy is extremely difficult. The Ministry ordered the Xinjiang Postal Director to temporarily set the selling price of stamps in the district to ten taels of official silver notes per yuan of postage, in accordance with the original method, and then gradually revise it after observing the situation, in order to reduce losses.

With the repeated intercession of the newspaper, it was tentatively approved to be waived, which is also common. Unexpectedly, after the accommodation, the newspaper published a criticism of the telephone bureau, saying that it was derelict in its duty and did not accommodate. It also made false accusations everywhere, using the false name of news to make reckless statements. Now it is clearly stated that it is difficult to discuss right and wrong. On August 21, it even beat up the workers and robbed the phone, which has been certified by the Wuhan Hospital and reviewed by the Public Security Bureau and transferred to the local court for investigation. Now reading the Shanghai newspaper, I dare not welcome it. The mirror is bright and clear, and the demons will be contained. Your esteemed presence will distinguish right from wrong. Special telegram, please check. Respectfully, Chen Shijing, Director of Wuhan Telephone Bureau.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Northwest Frontier Inspection Diary (1) Feng Youzhen <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Xi'an Newsletter: Luo Junren, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Judicial Administration, was ordered by the central government to inspect Xinjiang. He departed from Beijing at 8:00 am on August 25th on a special Air Eurasia No. 1 plane. I, the reporter, was invited to accompany him, and I was extremely fortunate. This trip will take three or four months through three or four provinces. Through Mr. Luo's inspection, the political and diplomatic situation of the border provinces, as well as the customs and habits of the people, can be thoroughly understood, and estrangement can be eliminated. The next day, he will report to the central government to strengthen the border defense and eliminate worries about the west. This trip is truly magnificent. I, the reporter, am grateful for the rare opportunity of this trip and for the government's special treatment of me. Therefore, I will record what I have seen and heard on this trip and share it with the people of the country.</p>
<h3 id="e73">(1) Saying Goodbye Carefully <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>August 25th, the weather was clear, but the sun was scorching, unlike early autumn. We thought that the climate would be colder when flying in the air, so we all changed into jackets in the morning, which caused us to sweat profusely and was unbearable. The new No. 1 plane prepared by Air Eurasia arrived in Beijing from Shanghai at about 6:00 am. We then took a car to Ming Palace Airport at about 7:00 am. When we arrived, hundreds of people, including central figures, officials from both the Ministry of Justice and Foreign affairs, and colleagues from the news media, had come to say goodbye. Their high affection and deep friendship were deeply felt. The No. 1 plane has a load capacity of 600 kilograms. Before the departure, it is necessary to weigh it as usual. We first went to the office to complete the procedures. After weighing the results, our luggage was simple, only 410 kilograms. Returning to the airport, the President of the Executive Yuan, Wang, also came by car to send off Minister Luo. It was 8 o'clock when it was time to leave. We shook hands with the send-off people one by one to say goodbye, and boarded the plane together. With a word of farewell, the plane quickly took off into the air. We said goodbye to Kyoto temporarily and began our journey of thousands of miles.</p>
<h3 id="e74">(2) Misfortune in the Plane <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>This is the first time I have traveled by plane, and I did not expect a big joke to happen just three minutes after taking off. Because I suffer from myopia, friends advised me to prepare an extra pair of glasses to prevent accidents in the remote border areas. So, three days before the trip, I got a new pair of glasses, which were quite suitable in terms of light and style. I was very happy and proud of myself. Unexpectedly, just three minutes after the plane took off, I felt phlegm stuck in my throat and wanted to spit it out. As soon as I leaned my head out of the window, I felt dizzy. I quickly touched my face with my hand, and my newly fitted glasses were gone. They had been blown away by the hurricane in the air. I felt lost for a long time.</p>
<h3 id="e75">(III) Another Layer of Heaven <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>After setting off for about ten-odd minutes, we encountered heavy fog. We felt a slight bumpiness and unevenness. The pilot then adjusted the plane upwards, piercing through the clouds and fog. In an instant, we had ascended to seven or eight thousand feet. At this altitude, the sky seemed boundless. The plane was also calm and steady. However, looking down, layer upon layer of white clouds rushed by like flowing arrows. Sunlight streamed down through the gaps in the clouds, casting mottled dark shadows on the earth. The rivers and roads crisscrossed like threads. Trees and houses were faintly discernible. After flying for two hours, the white clouds became even denser, sometimes rising and falling like lofty mountains and towering ridges, sometimes stretching endlessly like snow-covered plains. I thought I would only be able to witness such spectacular scenery upon reaching the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains. I never expected to have an unobstructed view of it just after leaving the capital. At this moment, the earth was completely separated from us. What people on the ground see as the sky is what we see as the earth, and we are in yet another layer of heaven. The plane flew smoothly without any discomfort, only the deafening noise was annoying, and the climate was quite cold, my lined clothing insufficient to withstand it, for we were already at an altitude of over ten thousand feet. Around twelve o'clock, the clouds parted and the fog dissipated. The plane descended slightly. Looking down, we saw layers upon layers of green mountains, densely overlapping, with sharply cut peaks and steep cliffs, presenting a perilous scene. We knew we were flying over the famous mountains of West Yue. Chang'an was in sight. It had only been five hours since we left Beijing. I could hardly believe we had traveled a thousand one hundred li.</p>
<h3 id="e76">(IV) Safely Arrived in Xijing <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>At one thirty, we arrived and landed at the airfield outside Xi'an City. Xi'an time was twelve forty-five in the afternoon, a difference of forty-five minutes from Nanjing time. Due to the plane's tire rupture, we stopped in the west corner of the airfield. Reception personnel immediately sent a car to greet us. Chairman Shao Liyu of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, along with the provincial government committee members and department heads, and Director Yang Hucheng of the Xi'an Pacification Commissioner's Office, along with various section chiefs, led the entire Special Task Force soldiers to be on guard and welcome us at the airfield. Minister Luo then, amidst the resounding music, accompanied Shao, Yang, and others as they rode into the city and settled down at the Xincheng Building. The Xincheng refers to the earthen city built by Feng Huanzhang when he was stationed in Shaanxi in the fifteenth year of the Republic (1926), specifically for training soldiers. The building is the residence built by Feng, now the residence of Yang, who diligently trains soldiers as in the past. Yang specially offered the building to Minister Luo, a hospitality that is greatly appreciated. After resting briefly at the residence, we had lunch, during which we discussed the matter of relocating convicts to build roads. Shao, Yang, and others all expressed their support in principle, but the scale is grand, and detailed measures are still under discussion. After the meal, Minister Luo, accompanied by Meng Yidong, President of the Shaanxi Provincial High Court, led me to inspect courts at all levels.</p>
<h3 id="e77">(V) Inspecting the Courts <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Around two o'clock, we first arrived at the High Court. President Meng, Chief Prosecutor Zhang Luxian, and the presiding judges of each court received us in the president's office for a discussion. President Meng earnestly detailed the judicial situation and difficulties in Shaanxi Province, with many pertinent points. The biggest difficulty for the Shaanxi judiciary is the shortage of funds. As a result, not only are the facilities crude and simple, but the salaries of judges are also meager, to the point where they cannot even afford to feed and clothe themselves, especially in the North and West circuits.</p>
<p>Prince Carl of Sweden (marked with an X) photographed during his visit to the Imperial Tombs in Beijing.</p>
<p>(International Photographic News Agency)</p>
<p>Judges are almost considered a path to be feared. President Meng has only been in Shaanxi for three months, and has a good relationship with the local government. Under the previous Chairman Yang Hucheng, he was able to increase funding by a quarter. The current Chairman Shao is also doing his best to maintain it, but it's a drop in the bucket and ultimately of no help. Minister Luo, after hearing this, deeply felt that the current judicial system needs significant improvement, especially in terms of funding. The principle of inter-provincial fiscal support should be adopted, and a comprehensive plan should be drawn up. Because our country is vast, and the wealth and poverty of each province are uneven, the situations are different. If we have uniform treatment, then legal professionals will be reluctant to go to poor provinces. Talent will be concentrated in rich areas, competing for positions, and engaging in mutual sabotage. If we want the legal world to be clear and pure, it will be impossible. Minister Luo then instructed President Meng to report the economic situation of the Shaanxi judiciary in detail to the Ministry, in order to compile the situations of each province and have the Ministry deliberate and come up with a regulatory plan after reorganizing the national legal system. This will prevent the hardship of no one being willing to come to the border provinces and the talent shortage from worsening, while preventing the concentration of talent in transportation areas and encouraging competition and sabotage. The so-called judicial funding should include the following points: (1) the treatment of judges, (2) the shortage of office expenses, (3) the amount of provincial funds that are insufficient, (4) a detailed comparison of the cost of living in Shaanxi and Nanjing, (5) other special circumstances. After the discussion, we inspected the various departments within the court. The court staff, despite their economic difficulties, were able to work diligently, which is commendable. Around three o'clock, we went to inspect the First Prison. Chairman Shao was already there, so we went together to observe the actual situation in the prison. The facilities of the First Prison are simple, and the prison cells are dilapidated. The walls are made of earth, and the windows are small. This is unavoidable due to limited funds. Fortunately, the outdoor open-air corridor is large enough for the prisoners to absorb sunlight and breathe fresh air, so many of those with disheveled hair and dirty faces are still strong and healthy. Minister Luo asked many questions about the reasons for the prisoners' crimes. Generally, male prisoners are mostly convicted of assault, and female prisoners are mostly convicted of murder. This is probably due to the strong and tough nature of the people in the north. The prison is not very crowded. Minister Luo instructed that the system of suspended sentences and bail should be actively implemented when the opportunity arises. Then we visited the prison workshop, which is also inadequately equipped due to lack of funds, so only a small number of prisoners are working. However, the products, such as wooden tables, wooden chairs, and cotton fabrics, are still of considerable quality. After the inspection, we went to the Chang'an District Court and the detention center with Chairman Shao. Minister Luo personally inquired about the detention dates of those being detained in the detention center. If some were not legal, he immediately ordered that the litigation be expedited and not be delayed, so as not to increase the suffering of the people. Around six o'clock, we returned to Xincheng. Shao and Yang jointly hosted a banquet, with military and political authorities in attendance. We parted after enjoying ourselves. Then I telegraphed Dean Wang and Chairman Zhu in Lanzhou to report on the itinerary, and scheduled to fly to Lanzhou at ten o'clock tomorrow morning.</p>
<h3 id="e78">(VI) Rain Hinders Travelers <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>On the 26th, I woke up early in the morning. Looking out the window, I saw the sky overcast with continuous drizzle. The pilot called, saying that the route was full of high mountains, and the climate was not suitable for flying, so the departure had to be postponed for a day. The Northwest has suffered from drought for many years, and the people are suffering greatly. This welcome rain is naturally pleasing to them. It is said that the wheat harvest every year depends entirely on the autumn rain. If the autumn rain is suitable, then next year's wheat harvest will be abundant. Spring rain is less important. Therefore, although our departure is delayed by a day, when I think of the abundant harvest next year and the disaster relief, I rejoice for tens of millions of disaster victims in the Northwest. Around eight o'clock, Minister Luo returned the visit to Chairman Yang, Wang and Shao. Then, accompanied by Chairman Shao, we visited the Beilin (Stele Forest). The Beilin is a famous historical site in Xi'an, built in the Tang Dynasty. It has a rich collection of famous steles and pagodas from various dynasties, numbering more than four hundred. The most popular inscriptions, such as the Xuanmi Pagoda, the Duobao Pagoda, the Controversy over Seats, Wang Youjun's Daya Collection, and the Thirteen Classics, are all erected here, making people linger and reluctant to leave. Around ten o'clock, we went to the Provincial First Library to visit this place's collection of famous and valuable carvings, utensils, books, and paintings from past dynasties, which is quite rich. The most notable is the Song Dynasty Qisha Tripitaka, with more than seven thousand volumes, secretly stored in a room with special protection. I heard that Shanghai bookstores have already issued printed versions for sale, worth more than five hundred gold. In addition, there is a Tang bell hanging on a frame, about three or four feet high, from the Tang Jingyun era (710-711 AD). There is also a Zhou Dynasty bronze tripod, valued at thirty thousand yuan. Other famous and valuable items are too numerous to mention. After browsing, we returned to the residence for lunch. It continued to rain in the afternoon, so we stayed in the residence and did not go out. Around four o'clock, Yang and Shao visited successively and had a meeting with Minister Luo. At six o'clock, Meng Zhaodong, President of the High Court, and Zhang Luxian, Chief Prosecutor, hosted a banquet. We returned to the residence at half past seven. The rain was still drizzling, but the pilot called, saying that we could hope to depart for Lanzhou at eight o'clock tomorrow morning.</p>
<h3 id="e79">(VII) A Glimpse of Xi'an <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>We have only been in Xi'an for two days. It is almost impossible to talk about what we have observed in such a rush. Well, let me briefly describe my impressions based on what I have heard and seen. The Three Qin regions have been the area for building capitals throughout the dynasties, and have been repeatedly devastated. The historical sites are no longer what they were. In recent years, natural disasters and man-made disasters have followed one after another. The suffering of the people is even more unbearable. Looking up, one sees yellow sand everywhere, fully expressing the unique desolation of the Northwest. Nine out of ten houses in Xi'an City are earthen walls with tile roofs. The market is bleak and withered, so it is not difficult to imagine what the situation in the countryside is like. Fortunately, the local military and police maintain public order effectively. Recently, they have repeatedly captured major bandits, solving many problems for the people. The government is working hard on construction, but it is difficult to make progress quickly due to economic constraints. The roads in the city are wide and flat, almost comparable to those in Beijing and Shanghai. Unfortunately, except for the east and west avenues, which are gravel roads, the rest are mud roads. When it is sunny, the sand flies around; when it rains, the mud splashes everywhere. In terms of transportation, the city relies entirely on rickshaws and donkey carts. Only the government agencies have one or two cars. Now, cars are used to travel east to Tongguan and west to Lanzhou, but donkey carts are still the main mode of transportation. The currency system used to be quite chaotic, but it has gradually stabilized after reorganization. Central government banknotes are fully accepted. Provincial banknotes fluctuate every day, worth about ninety cents of a silver dollar. The newspaper industry is gradually developing. There are three or four daily newspapers, such as the Xijing Daily, the Culture Daily, and the Qin Daily, publishing either two large sheets or one large sheet each day. The Xijing Daily is the most common. There are also three or four news agencies, such as the Xi'an branch of the Central News Agency and the Border Affairs News Agency. The Central News Agency branch is the most important. In the future, it is necessary to actively develop this to communicate news from the Northwest. Writing to this point, the reporter deeply feels that Shaanxi is an important town in the Northwest, with a vast area and sparse population, and abundant resources. It is urgent to actively develop it. Speaking of development, the following two points are particularly urgent: (A) Develop water conservancy. The reason why Shaanxi Province has suffered so terribly from disasters in recent years is because water conservancy has not been repaired, leading to drought and famine, and thousands of miles of red land. Although Shaanxi has the Yellow River and the Jing and Wei rivers, the area covered by the rivers is limited. Recently, although the Jingwei Canal has been built, irrigation only reaches three or four counties because the branch canals have not been completed. It is said that the rivers in the counties of northern Shaanxi are of no use to agriculture and rely entirely on the weather. Therefore, developing water conservancy is extremely urgent. On the one hand, dredge the rivers; on the other hand, complete the branch canals. Secondly, afforestation can regulate the climate and is also very important. Recently, I heard that the Agricultural and Forestry College has found a site in Wugong and will start operating within the year. Its future benefits will certainly be significant. (B) Develop transportation. Throughout Shaanxi Province, except for the area from Xi'an east to Tongguan and west to Lanzhou, where cars can pass, the rest of the transportation is extremely congested. Shaanxi is rich in products, such as coal and cotton, but they are difficult to transport and inconvenient to export. Therefore, developing transportation is extremely urgent, especially completing the Longhai Railway. This is not only beneficial to boosting commerce and immigrating to open up the border, but also has significant implications for military and political affairs. Recently, the American wheat loan has been concluded, but the use and distribution have not yet been determined. If the central government plans the overall situation and pays attention to the Northwest, using a portion for development, then the benefits</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>will be significant. Furthermore, technical cooperation from the League of Nations should focus on the Northwest. Secondly, outstanding domestic talent should also penetrate into remote provinces and divide up the development, so that everything can be revived and construction can be discussed.

<h3 id="e80">Military Situation in Northern Fujian Intensifies Again <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>= Fiercest fighting at Xiamou and Nankou =</p>
<p>= Newspaper news must be inspected =</p>
<p>Fuzhou correspondent: Recently, the Red Bandits in Liancheng and Changting counties have been severely suppressed by the Western Fujian army. They suffered heavy losses in the Pengkou and Sibao areas and found it difficult to gain a foothold. They fled north, invading Qingliu and Mingxi. As a result, it was widely rumored in the provincial capital that Jiangle and Shunchang counties had been attacked by the Red Bandits. At present, merchants transporting goods from Fuzhou to the upper reaches have also stopped. The provincial government immediately telegraphed Wang Jicheng, Chief of Staff of the 56th Division stationed in Yanping, to inquire about the actual situation. Last night, they received Wang's reply, stating that the bandit forces in Jiangle had not succeeded, and the bandit situation in Shunchang had not changed. After dispatching a team to increase defenses in Yanping, the area was very consolidated. It can be seen that the outside rumors are untrue. Furthermore, according to front-line news obtained by a certain military agency, the 78th Division's Qu Shounian unit has now been ordered to move from Yong'an to Anxi to replace the 61st Division's Mao Weisou unit. The newly formed 2nd Division's Lu Xingbang unit, the two brigades of Lu Xingrong and Tong Yonghan, are fighting with the bandits in Xiamou, at the junction of Shaxian and Mingxi. The 56th Division's Liu Heding and Gui Zhenyuan, and Jiang Yan's two brigades, are fighting with bandits in Nankou, at the junction of Jiangle and Mingxi. The fighting is very fierce. Currently, the Liu and Lu divisions are adopting an interior line warfare tactic, luring the bandits deep and then encircling and annihilating them. The county chiefs of the nearby bandit areas did not know this and made a fuss, using alarmist language to telegraph the province for assistance. The Pacification Headquarters believed that such actions would disturb the people, and yesterday specially ordered the county chiefs to remain calm and not disturb each other, affecting public order. At the same time, the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau also stated that at this time of intense bandit suppression, newspapers should be cautious in publishing news. It specially joined the Pacification Headquarters and the Provincial Party Headquarters to establish a news inspection office, which is scheduled to start inspecting on August 29. All news from various newspapers that has not been reviewed, stamped, and sealed by the office may not be published. (August 28)</p>
<h3 id="e81">Tai, Jia, and Bao Counties Request Exemption from Winter Grain Transport Surcharge <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>= The government's extension of the levy breaks faith with the people =</p>
<p>= The rural economy has collapsed and it is difficult to collect the levy =</p>
<p>Tai, Jia, and Bao counties telegraphed the Provincial Government, requesting exemption from the winter grain transport surcharge. The text read: "Since the province of Jiangsu has been collecting a winter grain transport surcharge of two yuan per shi (unit of dry measure) since the 18th year of the Republic (1929), the people have suffered greatly from the burden of this extra tax. The people have repeatedly appealed, exhausted and hoarse, and the Ministry of Finance has taken into consideration the concerns of rural bankruptcy and telegraphed your government to collect it at half price, but it was not approved. This year, when the land price tax is collected, it is heard that this special levy must still be collected. The people are terrified upon hearing this news. We dare to analyze the reasons why the collection should be stopped for your government: Since the 17th year of the Republic (1928), the collection of the two-yuan surcharge has continued. Your government once stated that it would last for one year only and then stop. Since then, year after year, it has been extended indefinitely. There is no greater breach of faith by the government to the people. If the people have no faith, they cannot stand. If the country has no faith, how can it stand? If we want to promote the implementation of government orders, we must maintain the government's prestige. This is the first reason why it should be stopped. The rural economy is on the verge of collapse. The reason for this is the low price of rice and the heavy taxes. Those who care about the people's suffering cry out loudly and seek collective relief. But the additional levies of the warlord era are still being followed, and the cutting is endless. The people are the foundation of the country. If the foundation is strong, the country will be stable. If the people's hearts are scattered, the country will collapse. This is the second reason why it should be stopped. Since the flood in the 20th year of the Republic (1931), the counties of Jiangsu have accumulated arrears of land tax. What is collected is only about 50% or 60% of the scheduled amount. This is not because the people do not know how to serve the public, but because the heavy taxes have caused hardship. We must reduce the current burden in order to hope for the repayment of old debts. If we add extra heavy levies, it is adding difficulty to difficulty, and extra levies will not be hoped for to improve. How can special levies be scraped together? The provincial government only has a name for increasing revenue, but in reality, it is implicitly short. The national treasury and the people's livelihood both suffer. This is the third reason why it should be stopped. Tai, Jia, and Bao counties suffered from Japanese aggression last year. Nine out of ten people are destitute. The severity of the disaster is unmatched by the counties of Jiangsu Province. The two-yuan surcharge in the 21st year of the Republic (1932) was caused by the general case of the entire province. The people have repeatedly appealed, but your government has not taken this into consideration. Disaster-stricken counties are treated the same as non-disaster-stricken counties. Considering the matter, it feels very unfair. The disaster victims who have not yet caught their breath can hardly bear this extra burden. This is the fourth reason why it should be stopped. For this reason, we jointly telegraph this petition, imploring your government to permanently abolish the special levy of two yuan for the winter grain transport, starting from this year, to show great faith and relieve the people's plight. We are extremely anxious and await your orders, Tang Wenzhi, Huang Shizuo, Wang Chengxiu, Gu Rui, Qian Shitong, Gu Heshushi, Wu Shiyong, Zhao Dingkui, Qian Songpan, Pan Changyu, Chen Zuiong, Jin Chengyong, Gu Gongliang, Jiang Enjian, Gong Baolin, and others respectfully bow thirty times."</p>
<h3 id="e82">He Jian Telegraphs that Chen Wo's Troops Have Collapsed <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>= Chen's Chief of Staff Captured and Executed =</p>
<p>= He Sends Li Jue to Handle the Aftermath =</p>
<p>Changsha correspondent: Chen Wo, who stubbornly resisted in Zhijiang, is the son of Chen Hanzhang, the former commander of the 8th Independent Brigade. Chen Hanzhang was assassinated in April of the 19th year of the Republic (1930). He Jian reorganized his troops and, considering that Chen's troops were all from the upper reaches of western Hunan, Chen Wo was still in command. The brigade was incorporated into Tao Guang's division, and Chen Wo was appointed brigade commander. Later, it was disbanded again for some reason. In May of this year, Chen suddenly occupied Zhijiang, Qianyang, and Huangxian counties, appointing county chiefs and intercepting taxes. He Jian then ordered the 3rd Division's Chen Zixian and the 62nd Division's Li Guojun's two brigades to attack Chen, successively recovering Qianyang and Huangxian counties. Chen then occupied the Zhijiang County seat. He Jian ordered his troops to besiege it for more than a month, and it was finally completely recovered on August 25. Chen Wo fled alone, and his troops surrendered their weapons. He Jian immediately ordered Li Jue, the acting security commander, to go to Zhijiang to handle the aftermath. Li went on the 29th and will convene the seven county chiefs, security regiment leaders, and gentry of Qianyang, Zhijiang, Huangxian, Suining, Jingxian, and Tongdao to discuss reorganizing the local defense and handling the aftermath. Here are the telegrams from Li, Chen, and others, recorded as follows: "The rebel Chen caused chaos in western Hunan. Since our army besieged him, he relied on the lives and property of the entire city as his shield, stubbornly resisting based on the danger. It has been two months. In recent days, he has suffered too much damage, and his internal affairs have been disorganized. On the day before yesterday, our Eastern city wall blew up a cavern, injuring many bandits, which increased panic. The next morning, the Tang camp of the bandit troops guarding the outside of the South Gate surrendered their weapons to us. The bandit troops in the city burned the civilian houses along the South Gate and the Leather Street, which was a terrible sight. The officials took the opportunity to supervise the troops, surrounding the city and launching a fierce attack. The Xie camp of the Li regiment defending the East Gate and the various troops at the Water East Gate were the first to ascend the city. Chen's regiment and He's regiment then attacked from the South Gate. Chen Wo, knowing that he could not succeed, led more than two hundred bandits to rush out from the back of the West Gate. Our army struck them in the middle of the night. Only twenty or thirty people escaped. The rest either drowned or surrendered and were captured. It is said that the rebel Chen himself, his life or death is unknown. Whether he drowned is not known. In total, except for more than thirty firearms that the bandit troops escaped with, all the remaining weapons were surrendered and captured. A bandit chief of staff, Han Cihou, was captured on the spot. Rebel Chen's rebellion harmed the people, all due to his plans. The people hated him to the bone and pleaded for him to be executed on the spot to satisfy the people's hearts. As for the twenty or thirty people who escaped, we have dispatched teams to follow and chase them down, and ordered all the militia teams to encircle and suppress them along the way, in order to cut off the roots. We respectfully telegraph this report. Li Guojun, Chen Zixian, Zhou Zhaojun, and Huang Suhe kowtow, grateful."</p>
<p>He Jian's telegram announcing the handling of the aftermath said, "Previously, the rebel Chen Wo took advantage of our bandit suppression that was being promoted to call himself a soldier in Zhijiang and Qianzhou, disrupting the rear. The crime is unpardonable. We sent Brigade Commander Li Guojun and Brigade Commander Chen Zixian to lead troops to arrest and suppress him, and also telegraphed for assistance in the arrest. Unexpectedly, after the bandit Chen was defeated in Qianyang, he occupied the Zhijiang County seat, stubbornly resisting on the basis of the danger. This commander-in-chief sympathized with the fact that the soldiers and civilians were mixed in the city and could not bear to use intense artillery fire, resulting in the destruction of everything. Therefore, the siege lasted for more than a month. It was only on the Shen hour of that day that, relying on the bravery of our soldiers, they took the lead in climbing the city. Most of the rebel troops surrendered their weapons, and the rebel Chen Wo fled alone, swimming through the water. He is being pursued and arrested. In addition to sending Li, the acting security commander, Jue, to Zhicheng immediately, on the one hand, investigate and identify the officers and soldiers who contributed and reward them, and on the other hand, comfort and ask the people who have suffered, and find ways to resettle them and properly plan the aftermath in order to eradicate the source of the chaos. Special telegraph to notify you. Furthermore, when Chen Wo started the rebellion, Chen Changyou, the commander of the Second Regiment of Bandit Suppression in the upper reaches of western Hunan, was killed because he refused to join the rebellion. His loyalty and righteousness are admirable and deeply regrettable. Order the acting commander Li to search for the remains, properly encoffinate and bury them, and provide a generous memorial service to comfort his loyal soul. Please also be informed."

<p>Two Bandit Leaders Executed by Firing Squad</p>
<p>Lei Xiaoheizi (age 19) and Li Sanmazi (age 28), bandit leaders from Henan, colluded with other bandits to kidnap more than 20 people in Changtiangang Township in Wujiang County, including a child surnamed Zhang, a monk from Donglin Temple, and male and female hostages, a female hostage from Beifang Township, and Pan Shoucheng and his daughter Pan Aizhen from Kuilianggang Dong Township in Damiaogang, among others.

<p>Dispute Over the National Goods Exhibition</p>
<p>Qian Zhongliang, the district chief of the First District Office, believing that this year is the National Goods Year, initiated the Autumn National Goods Exhibition in order to promote national goods. He submitted it to the 42nd District Affairs Conference for discussion and decided to organize a preparatory committee, recommending nine preparatory members, and in accordance with previous precedents, the venue was still set in the city park. When it was being actively prepared, the Park Management Committee, affiliated to the City Funds Property Committee, suddenly held a meeting and decided to refuse to lend the park. Some citizens, such as Guo Jie of the Third Class, sent letters to the Park Management Committee, asking them to refuse to lend the park. However, some citizens, such as Chen Hongjun, Wu Baoquan, Zhou Yinbo, and Xue Mingjian, sent letters to the First District Office, the City Funds Property Committee, and the Park Management Committee, arguing that the exhibition should be held in the park. If the exhibition is held in a place that citizens do not pay attention to, or in a secluded place, it will be difficult to achieve the practical effect of promoting national goods. The reasons stated in their original letter are very reasonable, and they hope that enthusiastic comrades will adopt them.</p>

<p>Provincial Technicians Expected to Arrive Today</p>
<p>County Government Goes to Province to Receive Funds for Urgent Repair</p>
<p>Two Organizations Request Allocation of Funds for Repair</p>
<p>The Dabaike News Agency reports that the Baoshan seawall has been damaged in ten places due to the impact of the hurricane, and the situation is extremely critical. Fortunately, the wind has subsided yesterday, avoiding further collapse. The Baoshan County Government sent two telegrams to the provincial government the day before yesterday, reporting the emergency. The provincial government has assigned technician Zhang Junsheng to go to Baoshan to inspect the damage, and he is expected to arrive today. Jin Qingzhang, the Magistrate of Baoshan County, convened an emergency meeting yesterday with various agencies, organizations, and local gentry to discuss prevention methods. They decided that the affected areas were too large and it was difficult to meet the emergency without a large sum of money. Therefore, they decided to send the County Magistrate and the Chief Technical Officer, Wan Kaijia, to the province yesterday to report to the provincial government and the Construction Department and to request funds from the Finance Department for urgent repairs. The county government is recruiting local workers to stack sandbags and stones to protect the areas that have already been damaged. Fortunately, last night was the full moon, and the moonlight was very bright, so rescue efforts continued throughout the night. Magistrate Jin Qingzhang also led Secretary Bao Siren on a personal inspection along the seawall, strictly supervising the work.</p>
<p>The Xinsheng News Agency reports that the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Local Coordination Association sent a telegram to the Jiangsu Provincial Government yesterday regarding the critical situation of the Baoshan seawall project, requesting the allocation of funds for repairs. The original telegram is recorded below: "To the Honorable Gu, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government in Zhenjiang: Regarding the request of our association and others for the allocation of funds for the repair of the Baoshan seawall, we have received your government's approval No. 1. After reading it carefully, we still have many concerns. The dangerous situation of the seawall project was previously reported by Yuan Xilian, a citizen of the county, who submitted detailed maps of the county government to your government for review. At that time, the requested amount was 200,000, while the amount re-estimated by your government's personnel was 40,000, a significant difference. This is undoubtedly a figure that cannot be saved. Blocking water is like blocking bandits, and it is difficult to estimate from afar. We believe that the number estimated by the dispatched personnel should be the basis for handling matters, as it is more practical. We are aware that the provincial treasury of Jiangsu is strained, and your government's allocation of 20,000 is undoubtedly a result of careful management. This matter concerns the lives of people in several counties. If an accident occurs, the remission of land taxes and the collection of relief funds must be carefully considered and weighed. In recent years, floods have frequently occurred in various provinces, partly because of the reluctance to spend money beforehand and the failure to prepare sufficient materials to repair each section early, leading to the sudden outbreak of disasters. The lessons of the past are not far away, and we should prevent a repeat of the same mistakes. Therefore, we dare to offer our humble opinion and humbly request your government to adopt it, which would be greatly appreciated. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai Local Coordination Association."</p>

<p>Other Losses Totaling Approximately 37.6 Million Yuan</p>
<p>The Xinxin News Agency reports that according to sources from the Railway Bureau, the Beining Railway was the earliest railway built in China and was well-managed and commercially developed. The newly emerging railways in the three northeastern provinces relied on the support of the railway, and were able to use its surplus funds to build Huludao and Yingkou wharves. The September 18th Incident in 1931 suddenly occurred, and the Beining Railway bore the brunt of the attack, and has suffered extensive damage from the bombings and destruction by the violent Japanese, and all previous efforts were in vain. The main and branch lines of the railway were originally 822 kilometers long. Later, with the completion of the Jinzhao and Jiutong two branch lines, it increased to 1,254 kilometers. Currently, the remaining sections within the customs are 476.68 kilometers, only about one-half of the original line. According to estimates by the Beining Railway Bureau, the total value of movable and immovable property of the main and branch lines in the sections outside the customs occupied by the violent Japanese is approximately over 300 million.

<p>After the Sikorsky aircraft took off from Hong Kong at 6:05 a.m. yesterday, it reported the situation along the way by radio. Therefore, the China National Aviation Corporation and the China Flying Transport Corporation received reports and sent personnel to Longhua Airport to welcome them. When the Sikorsky aircraft arrived at the airport at 4:30 p.m., it circled the airport twice and then gradually descended from the air and landed at the airport. Mr. Biggs-Spears and the other three jumped out of the aircraft one after another and shook hands with the welcomers, looking very happy. They then took cars to their residences to rest. The Sikorsky aircraft was pushed into the hangar by airport workers and properly secured.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning, when the Sikorsky aircraft was returning 200 miles northeast of Hong Kong, it happened to encounter the President Hoover, a ship of the Dollar Steamship Lines, at sea. The aircraft threw down a roll of Hong Kong newspapers to the President Hoover for the passengers to read. After receiving the report, the shipowner replied by radio to express their gratitude, saying that the presented mail would be framed and hung as a souvenir of the friendly relations between the aircraft and the ship, and wished a safe journey. After receiving the telegram, the aircraft also replied by radio, briefly stating that they were very grateful for the importance attached to the souvenirs. If this route is successful after this test flight, there will be many opportunities to meet in the future. Although the whistle of your ship was not heard, the white smoke was seen, and we are very grateful for your kindness. This is indeed a very interesting chance encounter in the successful China-Philippines test flight.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Surveying the Airport <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>According to a spokesperson of the company speaking to the Xinxin News Agency reporter, when Mr. Biggs-Spears and others arrived in Manila, they were warmly welcomed by all circles there. The Philippine government is also very enthusiastic about this and will grant United Airlines special operating rights for the Manila-Hong Kong route. Mr. Biggs-Spears has also surveyed five sites, Fuzhou, Hong Kong, Dongsha Island, Lake Prue, and Santiago Island, as airports.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Opening of the Air Service Still Pending <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>It is heard that Mr. Biggs-Spears, the American director of the company, plans to submit a detailed report to the company within a few days on the situation of the test flight from Shanghai. He also plans to prepare a comprehensive plan for opening a weekly mail flight between Shanghai and Manila and will send it to the American headquarters for decision after the business develops. Therefore, the official opening date of the Shanghai-Philippines air service has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>According to the accurate numbers, the total is approximately 37,600,000 yuan. The magnitude of the loss is shocking. The following is a loss survey table: (1) Loss of life of employees: 17 dead, 49 injured, and 1 kidnapped; (2) Loss of employee property: 304,176.49 yuan; (3) Loss of damaged railway property: 426,874.35 yuan; (4) Losses from looting: 1,815,437.645 yuan; (5) Loss of special expenses: 477,827.03 yuan; (6) Loss of mandatory expenses: 132,763.00 yuan; (7) Uneconomical consumption: 46,196.50 yuan; (8) Operating losses: 8,884,453.63 yuan (9) Loss of credit: 8,494,977.90 yuan; (10) Loss of life of passengers: 25 dead, 40 injured; (11) Loss of passenger property: 285,110.00 yuan, totaling 42 dead, 89 injured, 1 kidnapped, and losses of 37,588,455.35 yuan.</p>

<p>Many Puppet Soldiers Defecting</p>
<p>Japanese Supervision is Strict</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that the situation in the Northeast under the iron heel of the Japanese has been reported yesterday. The following is a compilation of the current situation of the anti-Japanese resistance, selected from the report dispatched from the Northeast by the special envoy of Mr. Cheng Yun, Commander-in-Chief of the Northeastern People's Salvation Army, on July 30, which has only recently arrived:</p>
<h3 id="e118">Bitter Resistance <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Dating back to March 2, our Eighth Route Army, led by Zhao Zaitian, engaged in the fiercest battle with the Japanese and puppet railway guards in Shenjiazhan and Zhangjiawobao on the Huhuai Railway. The battle lasted for four days. The enemy's reinforcements arrived and surrounded our army from all sides. Our army fought hand-to-hand and broke through the encirclement, retreating to the counties of Mudan, Dongxing, and Tonghe. In this battle, 19 Japanese soldiers were killed and 12 were wounded. More than 20 puppet soldiers were killed and more than 30 were wounded. Our army lost a battalion commander, 124 soldiers were killed in action, 259 were wounded, and 351 large and small firearms were lost. On March 15, our Ninth Army, led by Ma Zhiqing, and the Xu Brigade, engaged the Japanese and puppet mixed army of Chen Decai in Dongliaodianzi Lanhou Hill, Acheng. They fought each other for a day and a night, killing 5 enemies. Our army lost 16 soldiers killed in action. Because it was too close to the transportation routes, it was not convenient to stay for a long time, so they retreated to the mountains and valleys of Nianziguo Tumenzizi. On March 27, our Tenth Army, led by Jiang Yunwu, and the Geng and Jiang brigades, attacked Bayan County in Heilongjiang, but failed. They retreated to Dongxing. On April 11, our Fourth Army, led by Song Yongzi, and the Han Brigade, engaged in fierce battles with the rebellious Yin Regiment stationed in Fuyu for three days and nights. Finally, due to the exhaustion of ammunition and the increasing urgency of the enemy's attack, they had no choice but to retreat, with one part retreating to Wuchang and another part remaining hidden in the county. In this battle, our regimental commander Bi Zhong was killed in action, and 28 soldiers were killed or wounded. More than 30 large and small firearms were lost.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Desertion of Puppet Troops <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>A contingent of puppet troops deserted, consisting of over two thousand members of the Zhu Jiachangzi militia, located in the boundary of the Third District of Changchun County. They refused to surrender their arms to the Japanese army, expressed their opposition to the Japanese, and are now located within the territory of Panshi County. Furthermore, the Thirteenth Regiment stationed at Yongji Gangyao also defected due to conflicts with the Japanese army. Additionally, a newly emerged "Steel Squad" in Yanshou County, numbering approximately 20,000, is demonstrating formidable power, having expelled Zhang Tongce, the stationed puppet army commander, from the county. Reports regarding the current location and strength of our volunteer army are withheld due to military secrecy.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Deployment of Japanese Troops <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Concerning the deployment of Japanese troops and their deceitful tactics, the following can be stated: a large portion has been dispatched to areas along the borders of Manzhouli and Suifenhe to defend against our army. Other units are stationed at the Great Wall and Jehol. The exact number of troops stationed in each province is unknown, but they frequently issue clothing to overseas merchants. During periods of subdued news, they order troops to disguise themselves as merchants; during periods of escalating tensions, they parade through various locations to demonstrate strength. The Japanese are skilled in deceit and falsehood, and this is one example. The Japanese military depot is located in Toutaogou, the puppet capital. Its ammunition and supplies can support the troops stationed in the Northeast for three to four months. Other locations such as Liaoning, Jilin, and Harbin have insufficient ammunition and supplies, only enough to maintain the current situation.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Japanese Surveillance of Puppet Troops <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese surveillance of the puppet troops is extremely strict, and their methods are particularly noteworthy. Recently, another troop reduction conference was held in the puppet capital, implementing reductions in troop size and reorganizations. Many Japanese personnel were incorporated. Puppet army officers holding slightly important positions are assigned a Japanese woman to secretly monitor their actions to prevent unexpected incidents. This strict surveillance is not only applied to puppet army officers but also thoroughly to lower-ranking officers. In each puppet army brigade, two Japanese regimental officers are stationed. In each regiment, two Japanese battalion commanders are stationed. In each battalion, two Japanese company commanders are stationed. If this continues, the positions of puppet army officers will likely be undermined. In reality, none of the puppet army officers genuinely support the rebels. They are merely compelled by circumstances and dare not hastily engage in desertion. Although there are some who willingly fawn over the Japanese, they are in the extreme minority, limited to those holding the highest military authority, such as the traitors Zhang Jinghui, Zhang Haipeng, and Yu Zhishan.</p>

<h3 id="e122">The Xinming Steamer Encounters a Hurricane, Escapes Danger, and Arrives in Shanghai <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>=Encountered danger in the waters off Sheshan, both anchors broken=</p>
<p>=Drifted for more than twenty hours, believing it would sink=</p>
<p>=Four crew members injured, cargo and other items damaged extensively=</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xinming steamer, the first-class vessel in the Northern Seas route, encountered a sudden hurricane off Sheshan this time. After drifting in the sea for twenty-two hours in extreme danger, it managed to escape and arrive in Shanghai, which was truly fortunate. It now requires repairs. The details of the encounter are described below.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Hurricane Encountered at Sheshan <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The Xinming steamer departed from Weihaiwei at 10:30 PM on August 31st. Initially, the journey was smooth and uneventful. However, at 12:00 AM on September 2nd, the steamer encountered a strong wind and showers approximately sixteen nautical miles north of Sheshan. By 1:00 PM, it received a warning from the observatory stating that a hurricane was approaching. At that time, the steamer was directly in the eye of the storm. The captain urgently wanted to return to Weihaiwei to take shelter from the wind, but it was impossible to sail north against the northeast wind. Sailing south was also impossible due to numerous reefs. The decision was made to head north, drop anchor temporarily in the heavy wind and rain, and wait for an opportunity to proceed. However, as the steamer turned, the hurricane struck. Waves crashed down like mountains overturning the sea, striking head-on and subjecting the Xinming to unprecedented danger.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Turbulent Waves Filled the Sky <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The size of the wind and waves at that time was the largest the steamer had ever encountered. A wave crashed down, engulfing the entire vessel. Captain Ma Jiajun urgently issued an emergency mobilization order to all staff and crew, instructing them to position the ship against the wind and waves. However, the wind force was like a mountain, pushing the ship backward. They urgently dropped both anchors to try to stop the ship, but to no avail. The captain then ordered the engineers to engage full speed ahead after dropping anchor to resist the storm. However, this not only failed to make any progress but also resulted in the ship being pushed back by the waves. At this point, the entire crew was extremely anxious, as they were bound to hit a reef and break apart, causing all the passengers and cargo to be lost. This situation persisted for approximately six hours as the ship continued to be pushed backward by the huge waves. The captain then ordered more anchor chain to be released, throwing thirty fathoms of the heavy chain into the sea. Still, it was difficult to avert the crisis.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Cargo Destroyed <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>By 8:00 PM, the wind and waves intensified. A wave crashed down, sweeping away the objects on the bridge, the cargo loaded on the deck, and the passengers' luggage and trunks into the sea. The captain and chief mate were unable to work on the bridge and moved to the lower level to use a spare compass, continuing to command forcefully in the heavy wind and rain. Unexpectedly, several large waves, four or five zhang high, struck, completely destroying the grand dining room, officers' cabins, steerage cabins, the deck, railings, doors, window panels, awnings, and mooring lines. Seawater rushed into the cabins, flooding the entire ship. The ship suddenly pitched and rolled, making it impossible for people to stand. Over three hundred crew members and passengers were submerged in water.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Chain Breaks, Anchor Lost <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>At this critical moment, wireless messages were frequently sent, but the Xujiahui station's antenna was broken, and communication was impossible. Over two hundred passengers on board scrambled to the grand dining room, crying and wailing in despair. Employees of the business department also knelt in the water, praying to the gods. The captain ordered the engagement of the fastest speed, hoping to withstand the onslaught. At approximately 3:00 AM on the third day, they saw the anchor chain spark and heard a loud crash. Both chains had broken, and both massive anchors had been lost at sea. The ship suddenly tilted, threatening to capsize in the sea. At that moment, the captain believed that he would not survive and tried to pull out his pistol to commit suicide but was disarmed by the chief mate. Just as the situation was most critical, a huge wave arrived and righted the Xinming, which was a stroke of great fortune. Otherwise, the entire ship would have been destroyed.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Drifting on the Sea <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>After the chains broke, Captain Ma ordered the remaining heavy chain on board to be released into the sea, abandoning any hope of survival. He then used a sounding line to measure the depth. At 4:00 AM on the third day, the depth was measured at five fathoms (thirty feet). The crew was even more terrified, as the ship was approaching the beach and reefs. The ship had lost control, and if it continued to drift backward, it would shatter on the reefs and no one would survive. Just as they were preparing to distribute life jackets to the passengers, they suddenly received a report from the observatory stating that the wind direction had shifted from northeast to northwest. Examining the barometer on board, they saw it gradually rising. A glimmer of hope appeared as they narrowly escaped death. They redoubled their efforts to push forward. From the start of the storm to the shift in wind direction, the Xinming had drifted on the sea for a total of twenty-two hours.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Escaping from Death <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>At 5:00 AM on the third day, the wind and waves were still strong, and the showers continued. Fortunately, the direction had shifted, and the Xinming was drifting further out to sea, escaping the danger of the beaches and reefs. At that time, the ship was still drifting against the waves. By 9:00 AM after dawn, it had escaped the greatest danger, and the wind gradually subsided. The observatory reported that the hurricane was at 123 degrees east longitude and 32 degrees north latitude. Captain Ma urgently ordered the anchor to be raised, adjusted the course southward, and calculated that from the encounter with the wind to that point, the entire crew and sailors had worked hard in the storm for forty hours without sleep or food. At this time, they did not know where they were. At 12:00 PM, they gradually saw a mountain. Captain Ma checked the chart and realized that they had reached Huanao Island. It was estimated that they had drifted over forty nautical miles from Sheshan due to the wind. However, although the wind had subsided, they still could not navigate. No ships were visible on the sea. It was not until 4:00 PM that they reached Daji Island, giving everyone on board hope for survival.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Sailors Injured <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>According to Captain Ma, who spoke to reporters, this was the first time he had encountered such a storm. He believed there was no hope of returning alive, but the fortunate escape was due to both human effort and divine assistance. The reporter was shown the damaged cabins, almost none of the doors and windows were intact. At the most dangerous time, the water depth on the upper deck was three to four feet, indicating the extent of the flooding in the other cabins. Four sailors and helmsmen working on the deck were struck by a large wave that swept from the bow to the stern. The four were thrown against the iron fixtures on the deck, each suffering serious injuries. One helmsman was even more severely injured. Other crew members and sailors suffered minor injuries from being struck by the waves. Objects inside the cabins were either swept away or washed into the sea, resulting in significant losses.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Arrived in Port Yesterday Morning <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The Xinming managed to escape danger and set sail for Shanghai at 1:00 PM on the third day. It was not until 6:30 PM that the ship reached the mouth of the Yangtze River outside Wusong. At that time, because the anchors had been lost, they had to retreat and anchor outside Songkou. They were only able to enter port yesterday morning and arrive at the Jinliyuan Wharf. By then, the passenger accommodations and deck structures had been badly damaged. A report was immediately made to the general office, and Liu Hongsheng dispatched engineers to inspect the ship and arrange for major repairs to prepare for reinstallation. Generous consolation was also given to the crew who had survived the ordeal. Their safe arrival in Shanghai after surviving such danger was due to the efforts and blood of the crew. The passengers on board were also overjoyed upon arrival. Although all their luggage had been lost, they admired Captain Ma's composure in the face of adversity. Everyone's life was spared, feeling as if they had been reborn. However, when they went ashore, their clothes were soaked, and they were in a state of disarray. The total loss was estimated to be at least thirty to forty thousand taels of silver.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Captain's Lingering Fears <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Captain Ma also told reporters that when the Xinming arrived at Dongsha, the lightship there, which was supposed to guide ships, had been swept away by the storm. The lighthouse was extinguished and dark, and the lightship was nowhere to be seen. The personnel managing the lightship must have also encountered danger. Furthermore, the lights of the Yangtze River estuary lighthouse were also extinguished by the storm, causing the Xinming to grope its way in the dark. The wireless antenna at Xujiahui was also damaged by the hurricane, preventing ships at sea from communicating. It was heard that the Taikoo Swatow steamer also encountered the storm and delayed its arrival by two days, expected to arrive in Shanghai today.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Zeng Pu and Others Request Exemption from Winter Grain Transport Tax and Surcharge <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Zeng Pu and others sent a telegram to Finance Minister Song, which read: "To Song Jun, Finance Minister of the Capital and Vice President of the Executive Yuan: Since the Jiangsu Provincial Government abolished the grain transport tax in 1930 and replaced it with a land price tax, the case of continuing to levy a surcharge of two yuan per dan of winter grain has been presented to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance, following old errors. The provincial legal bodies and citizens of various counties, based on legal facts, have repeatedly resolved not to extend the collection and have appealed for a stop. The Ministry was repeatedly requested and approved to advise the province to correct this. After the disaster, the people of Jiangsu were hoping for relief. It is recently heard that this surcharge is still listed in the provincial budget for 1933, and there is talk of seeking approval from the Ministry in advance without waiting for your return. It is reported that you have achieved great success at the World Economic Conference in obtaining silver agreements and technical cooperation. Standards for rationalizing finances have long been established. Jiangsu Province is located near the capital, making administrative compliance convenient. Surely there is no lack of methods to alleviate poverty. Yet, the province only knows to seek profit, not caring for the people's labor, and wants to reverse course and impose a surcharge in a time of long-abolished grain transport and plummeting grain prices. It seeks to extend the evil precedent by using high-pressure tactics to deceive the central government with this illegal levy. We fear that the rural economy will be increasingly on the brink of collapse. What about the reconstruction plan? This will harm your reputation and distant views, and it is not just the people of Jiangsu who will suffer deeply. We ask that you investigate and reject the proposal for Jiangsu Province to continue collecting the surcharge this year, and order that the previously collected amounts be refunded in installments under the regular tax items to maintain national credibility and care for the people's livelihood. We urgently await your orders. Respectfully submitted on behalf of the citizens of Changshu residing in Shanghai: Zeng Pu, Di Liangsun, Yu Chengmei, Zhang Lansi, Huang Bingyuan, Weng Zhilin, Weng Zhilong, and Zeng Xubai, all kowtowing in support."</p>

<h3 id="e134">The Tragic Situation in Yingfu County After the Disaster <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>As Many as Four Thousand People Torn Up</p>
<p>The Red Swastika Society Is Urgently Implementing Relief Measures</p>
<p>The Southeast Main Association and Shanghai General Office of the Red Swastika Society received a letter from Relief Commissioner Wang Daoyuan yesterday, describing the cruelty of the bandits, which brought tears to the reader's eyes. The original letter is recorded below: "Respected Sirs: I have received your telegram with reverence. The number of towns and villages in Yingfu and Taihe Counties that have been burned, looted, and kidnapped is as many as twenty-five. After pursuit and suppression, the bandits have moved from Taihe towards Zhoukou, but there are still traces of bandits in Tai territory. The cruelty of the bandits is unprecedented. Of the eight thousand people who were kidnapped, over one thousand were torn up in Nanzhao Village, and three thousand were torn up in the old county of Taihe. The number of those who were ransomed is limited, because once a hostage enters bandit territory, they are subject to multiple factions. Each faction will conduct searches, and if money is found, it is confiscated regardless of whether it is for ransom. When the money is taken, the hostages cry and plead with the faction, but they are accused of lying, and either their ears are cut off, or one of their hands is severed, and they are sent back to raise money. If the money is not delivered by the deadline, they are killed. Children of eight years old are tied together in a string, nine and ten-year-olds are tied together in another string, and those over ten are tied together in a string, all connected with hemp ropes. They are beaten with whips and forced to 'jump and run' for the bandits' amusement. Kidnapped women are forced to march naked, providing amusement at any time. However, those who are truly wealthy and have a reputation are placed on large tables, turned upside down with the legs facing up, and carried by four men using wooden poles, called 'God of Wealth.' They are even provided with food and drink at each location. If the ransom is not paid by the deadline, they will not be spared. The bandits have many cavalrymen, and their saddles are made from chairs that have been sawed in half, using two chair surfaces joined together as one saddle, allowing for rapid movement. All of this was recounted by refugees who escaped from the bandit dens. After consulting with representatives from Ying, Shang, Fuyang, and Zhengyang, we have decided to start with Nanzhao Village in Ying and Liujia Village in Fu, conducting investigations and releases as we go. We have already arrived in Ying to investigate. After finishing the investigation and release, we will proceed from Ying to Fu, and from Fu to Tai. However, the roads are difficult, requiring either soil carts or walking, making it impossible to move quickly. The most difficult thing is that the houses in the disaster area have been reduced to ruins, making food and accommodation inconvenient. We have already brought dry food and water bottles. In addition, although the corpses in various towns have been buried by the Ying and Fu associations, many have drowned in rivers and wells, making the drinking water smell foul. There are many epidemic cases among the disaster victims. Therefore, we requested in the previous telegram that more medicines be allocated for distribution to the disaster areas. The Anhui Provincial Government has also dispatched four relief commissioners, and the relief funds amount to only five thousand yuan. They are currently convening a meeting of officials and gentry to discuss solutions."</p>
<p>Also attached is a letter from the Yingxi Refugee Appeal Group, which reads: "To our fellow countrymen, elders, brothers, and compatriots in Anhui Province: Alas! Is there anyone in the world who has suffered a more tragic and cruel disaster than we refugees of Yingxi, who are in deep water and fire and displaced by bandits? If we were to enumerate the various cruelties we have endured, and convey them one by one to your ears, we fear that even the hearts of stone would be moved. All those who are human beings will gnash their teeth and tear their eyes. We refugees are residents of the Shahuang Two Rivers in Yingxi. In the past, we have suffered from natural and man-made disasters, which were already numerous enough. Recently, disaster has struck from the sky, and bandits have risen up, raping, killing, burning, and looting with extreme cruelty, reducing houses to ruins, wealth to ashes, and people to death. We refugees fled in panic, luckily escaping slaughter. We fled by boat to the docks of Liuzikou, Baliduo, and Yujiatan. Our frightened souls were barely settled, and our breathing had not yet returned to normal when we began to think about the ruined property, the lack of livelihood, the displacement of the population, and the inability to return home. Every time we think of this, we choke with sobs and feel desperate. But our bad luck has not ended, and it is like adding snow to frost. Some people claiming to be from the Zhengyang Boat Tax Office sent out rowboats carrying seven soldiers with guns, going to each dock to forcibly collect boat taxes and personnel registration fees, as well as fees for kerosene. We refugees have difficulty getting enough to eat, so how can we afford to pay taxes? If we object even slightly, we are immediately whipped. Those who cannot pay the tax are detained in the two water prisons, and there are almost no exceptions. Those who were unable to pay the taxes were detained in the two waterways administrations. Over the past few days, almost all who were hoisted up to show off and whipped and beaten have been released after Wang, the President of the Merchants Association, offered a guarantee of release. The other 20 people or so were released on bail for a fee. We refugees weep and think that even if the checkpoints were normally dignified, those who had to pass through would be required to declare their taxes. However, the Boat Tax Office is far away in Zhengyang and, regardless of whether we passed through or not, sees where the profit is and goes its own way. It sends boats upstream for several or even dozens of miles to force the collection of taxes, knowing only to scrape as much as possible to make a profit, regardless of the pitiful lives of the refugees. The government is sending troops to suppress the bandits, and charitable organizations are raising funds for relief, but the Boat Tax Office alone is intensifying its actions, violating the law and harming the people, treating hundreds of refugee boats as a source of profit. With such measures, the refugees will have no place to call for justice, and the accumulated resentment will be difficult to express. The resulting grievances will inevitably lead to droughts and floods. Alas, what is the point of the government sending troops to suppress the bandits? What is the point of charitable organizations raising funds for relief? We refugees have suffered cruelly and present our case with tears. We implore our fellow countrymen, elders, brothers, and compatriots to uphold justice, provide us with assistance, and fundamentally abolish this illegal and harmful Boat Tax Office to provide relief to the refugees. We respectfully make this request, and we beg you to consider."</p>
<h3 id="e135">Reports Received by the Chinese and Foreign Joint Relief Association Regarding the Yellow River Flood Disaster <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Shandong Association in Beijing: This time, the Yellow River flood has caused a major disaster in the four provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and Jiangsu. The disaster is especially severe in the ten-odd counties of Heze, Juye, Fan, Pu, Yuncheng, Dongping, and Shouzhang in Shandong. The houses have been destroyed by the flood. The disaster victims are climbing on roofs and trees, crying for food. The old and weak are rolling in the ditches, dying. We are calling on our relatives and friends to show compassion and beg from door to door. There are no houses with fires in the neighborhood. We urgently request quick relief.</p>
<p>Dingtao County, Shandong: On August 13, the Yellow River breached its banks, flooding directly into the county. Over one hundred villages south of the city were turned into a vast ocean. For over ten nights, torrential rain poured down. The cries of tens of thousands of people shook the wilderness. We beg for urgent relief.</p>
<p>In addition to dispatching special commissioners to conduct on-site investigations, the association has also received reports from Chinese and Western personnel in the disaster areas. After the dike breach in Henan, the flood spread to dozens of counties in Hebei, western Shandong, and northern Jiangsu, drowning over a million people. There are over thirty-three breaches along the Yellow River, causing losses of over ten million yuan. The disaster victims are currently struggling in the water, crying out for help. Their lives are in danger. The association is reportedly working with Western staff in various disaster areas to find ways to provide rescue. However, as the weather is gradually turning cold and there are wails of grief everywhere, with no place to eat or sleep, if they do not become victims of the flood, they will inevitably die from the epidemic. We urgently hope that charitable people from all walks of life will show great compassion, quickly provide assistance, and perform broad-based charitable deeds. As the association does not have branches, donations can be sent directly to Room 402, No. 12 Renji Road, Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Detailed Report of the Fuyang Disaster Received by the Jisheng Society <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Society recently received a report from the Fuyang Relief Committee of Anhui, stating: "Fuyang is located on the border of Anhui, adjacent to Henan, and is traditionally an area where bandits emerge. In late July, local bandits such as Zhang Xueliang and others colluded with defeated soldiers. Regiment Commander Cheng Yaode made a major eastward move, reaching Song Village on Sunday and Yingxiandian on Monday, merging with the bandits Jiang, Ma, Fan, Ba, Yang, Xiaohei, and Zi who had captured Pochu Village. The total number of bandits was approximately eight thousand. On Tuesday, they reached Fan Village, and on Wednesday, they reached Tongzhen Village, Tianpeng Village, and Xincun Village. On the 30th, they reached Datian City Village and Cheng Village. On the 31st at night, the bandits arrived at the city and harassed it for several hours. At dawn, they circled the Five Li Temple south of the city, Nine Li Gully, Seven Li Store, Eighteen Li Store, Thirty Li Store, Forty Li Store, and Siliu Village, occupying them for three days. On Sunday, they reached Fifty Li Store and Sixty Li Store, and Xinjizi. On Monday, they reached the Ying County territory, West Sixty Li Store, Fifty Li Store, Forty Li Store, Thirty Li Store, and Da Bali Store, occupying places such as Runhe Village. On Tuesday, they occupied Nanzhao Village, and then reached Zhangjiazhai and Gaogangtou in the Third District of this county. By Wednesday, Cheng Ziyi, the commander of the Henan Security Team, led two regiments of infantry and one regiment of cavalry to Jiao Po Village and advanced along two routes. When they reached Nanzhao Village, they engaged the bandits, fighting fiercely for two days and nights. On Thursday, the bandits retreated from Sixty Li Store, circled the city, turned northwest, and occupied Datian City Village for one day. On Friday, they crossed the Quan River and occupied the old county of Taihe territory via Jia Village, Jiangjia Hall, Wen Village, and Hua Village. The killing and wounding along the way were countless, and tens of thousands of men and women were kidnapped. The east-west span was three to four hundred li, and the north-south span was over one hundred li. The people and livestock were almost all slaughtered, the village houses were burned to the ground, and corpses were everywhere, with a stench that could not be tolerated. There were severed heads, broken abdomens, amputated limbs, peeled skin, cut ears, cut breasts, nailed hearts, and nailed hands. Those near the river were driven into the water, and pregnant women were thrown to their deaths, and the infants were thrown as well. The extreme cruelty cannot be fully described, even worse than the Communist bandits. Survivors have no houses to hide their heads, no clothes to cover their bodies, and no food to fill their stomachs. If relief measures are not taken, they will still have nowhere to escape death. As the autumn coolness gradually sets in, they will inevitably perish together. Thinking of the future, we are extremely heartbroken. In addition to sending telegrams to appeal, we beg you to allocate large sums of money to save the people from the disaster. We urgently await your orders." The disastrous situation has reached this extreme. The association has no funds to provide relief and hopes that compassionate and virtuous people within the country will take this opportunity to save and bless, and the merits will be boundless. Perhaps we can save the survivors from one in ten thousand.</p>

(3) Prominent Sichuanese figures in Beijing, such as Shi Qingyang, Lü Chao, and Sun Yuanliang, have replied, expressing their willingness to donate funds or come to Shanghai to jointly plan the effort. A letter will be sent to Chairman Shi Qingyang, inviting him to quickly come to Shanghai with other compatriots to jointly host various charitable organizations and philanthropists in this city and request relief. (4) The administrative group will quickly prepare several fundraising books, with the introduction drafted by the document department, and all committee members listed by name. (5) Committee members who do not hold leadership positions in any group will serve as fundraising committee members in the fundraising group, with ten people forming a team to quickly solicit donations externally. (6) The collected donations will be gathered by the collection group every ten days, announced publicly, and handed over to the custody group for safekeeping. (7) All expenses of the association will be donated by the committee members themselves. All the funds raised will be used for disaster relief and will not be used for administrative expenses. (8) This special committee will be externally known as the Sichuan Shanghai Compatriot Association Relief Committee for the Red Zone Disaster in Northern Sichuan, and a seal will be printed to demonstrate credibility.

<h3 id="e138">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Solicits Enemy Goods Samples <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>So Compatriots Can Easily Identify Them</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a letter to the National Goods Factory Federation stating that they had received a letter from the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of the Capital, saying that the association was planning to set up an enemy goods exhibition room to provide the city and local compatriots with a place to browse, so they could easily identify enemy goods in order to fundamentally eliminate them. However, the types of enemy goods are numerous, and collecting samples is beyond the association's ability. They specifically requested the Chamber to collect samples of old enemy goods and national goods from various manufacturers on their behalf and forward them to the association for listing and exhibition to the public, so that enemy goods can be eliminated. The association admires the Chamber's anti-Japanese national salvation efforts, which are quite enthusiastic, and they will certainly approve as requested, etc. The Chamber of Commerce noted that recently, there have been misunderstandings in the sale of domestic goods everywhere. If samples can be collected and displayed in a room for examination, there will be less resistance during sales. It is appropriate to send a letter to the Federation to forward to its members, collect samples, and send them directly to the exhibition. This is highly anticipated.</p>

<p>Seven Maps in Southern Shanghai, Two Maps in Zhabei, One Map in Pengpu</p>
<p>The Municipal Land Bureau had previously issued a notice to all land users regarding the collection of land price tax. Now, the bureau fears that landowners in various places do not yet understand the areas for which land prices must be reported. Therefore, they issued Announcement No. 70 yesterday, specifying the maps, and it reads: "Regarding the announcement, the bureau has issued separate announcements to inform all land users in Shanghai South, Zhabei, and the Western District who have lands included in the land price tax area that they should come to the bureau to collect land price declaration forms within one month, from September 1st to the end of the month. Now, for fear that the land users do not understand the maps, the bureau will re-open the maps in detail. All land users should abide by them and must come to the bureau to declare the land price within the time limit without any delay. This announcement includes the following: Shanghai South District: Map 1: Tianwei, Diwei, Yuanwei, Huangwei; Map 2: Yuwei, Zhouwei, Hongwei; Map 3: Huangwei, Riwei, Yuewei; Map 4: Yingwei, Zeiwei, Chenwei, Suwei; Map 5: Liewei, Zhangwei, Hanwei; Map 6: Laiwei, Shuwei, Wangwei; Map 7: Qiuwei, Shouwei, Dongwei, Cangwei; Zhabei District: Map 1: Tianwei, Diwei, Yuanwei, Huangwei; Map 2: Yuwei, Zhouwei, Hongwei; Pengpu District: Jin 2 Map, Dongjianwei.</p>

Recently, the society has had many party and state dignitaries and social figures join as initiators. Yesterday, the society received a permit from the Shanghai Municipal Party Department, allowing it to proceed with the organization. It was specially decided to hold a founding meeting in the near future to elect staff, pass the articles of association, and report to the internal affairs department for record, completing all necessary procedures so that it can start work soon. It is heard that the association's address is temporarily set at No. 10 Park Road, and branch associations will be established in various provinces and cities to solicit more members.</p>

<p>Chiang Chang-kuei, the chief of the cashier section of the accounting department of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration, was the brother of Gu Weijun, the minister to the United States. After Chiang's wife, Qian, lost her sight, she treated Hu Changjuan, Chiang's young and chaste widow, quite harshly, causing Ms. Hu to feel unbearable living with her in-laws for a long time. She hired attorney Chen to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Court, requesting separation and ordering the defendant to pay alimony of 30,000 yuan. The initial trial concluded, and the plaintiff's request for separation was granted, but the alimony portion was rejected. Chiang Hu Changjuan was unwilling to achieve only half of her goal and hired attorney Chen to file an appeal with the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. Chiang Chang-kuei also hired attorney Shi Chao to defend himself according to the law. Yesterday afternoon was the date for the trial. Both parties did not appear in person, and each was represented by an attorney who agreed to request a two-week adjournment. Mediation is currently underway externally, and there is a high hope for reconciliation. After deliberation, Judge Li and two magistrates, Han and Ni, approved the adjournment to 2:00 PM on September 18.</p>

<h3 id="e143">Young Man and Woman Commit Suicide by Jumping into the Huangpu River <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Boarded the Da Lai Ferry and Jumped into the Water Near Pudong</p>
<p>The Bodies of the Man and Woman Were Recovered Separately Yesterday, No Suicide Notes Found</p>
<p>At 8:00 PM on the 1st of this month, a fashionable young man and woman boarded a small Da Lai Company ferry at the Hankou Road Customs Wharf, hand in hand, seemingly intending to go to the company's (McKinley) world-class giant ship "President," which was berthed between No. 10 and No. 13 of the Yangshupu Customs. At that time, the sailors on the small ferry were convinced that they were going abroad. Unexpectedly, when the ferry arrived near the Pudong cemetery pier outside Hongkou, this couple took advantage of an opportunity when no one was paying attention and suddenly jumped hand in hand into the turbulent waves. In that instant, the sailors on the ferry tried to save them, but it was too late. They stopped the engine to rescue them, but they had already sunk and disappeared. Afterwards, the ferry captain, Wang Arong, returned to the shipping company and found that the man and woman had not purchased tickets and were not passengers going abroad. They reported it to the Customs Police Station for the families to inquire. Unexpectedly, after the two people fell into the water, their bodies had already separated. At 6:00 AM yesterday, the man's body floated to the surface of the Huangpu River in Lujiazui and was recovered by Chinese police officer No. 30 from the Water Police Station. As for the woman's body, it was found floating downstream in the Yangshupu Huangpu River and was also recovered by Chinese police officer from the Water Police Station. The two bodies were not yet rotten. At 11:00 AM in the morning, when the tide was rising, the No. 2 patrol boat of the Nanshi Lifesaving Bureau transported the two bodies to the bureau one after another. The bureau's staff inspected them and found that the man was wearing a Western suit with a white Indian silk shirt, a black sports vest, yellow trousers, blue cotton shorts, a white belt, black socks, and yellow running shoes. He had long hair and was about 20 years old. He seemed to be a handsome young man. He only had a double-corner silver dollar and three double-cents on him. The woman was wearing a white Indian silk cheongsam, a green suspender vest, red flower silk shorts, flesh-colored stockings, and black high-heeled leather shoes. She was about 20 years old. Neither of them had left a suicide note or business card, so it is temporarily difficult to determine their names, ages, origins, and backgrounds. However, their appearance is quite similar to that of students who have received higher education. As for the reason for their suicide, it is probably related to love. Yesterday afternoon, the Lifesaving Bureau placed the bodies of the man and woman in coffins separately and temporarily left them in the coffin storage room, waiting for relatives to claim them. If no one inquires after three days, the coffins will be transported to the bureau's purchased charity cemetery in Tangwan Township, Minhang, for temporary burial.</p>

<p>Two Sentenced to Life Imprisonment</p>
<p>Zhou Laowu, a Nanjing newspaper vendor for the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, was murdered on the morning of March 22nd at 6:15 AM in Shanqing Lane, Avenue Edward VII. The murderer could not be apprehended, and the case was suspended for half a year. Until the 14th of last month, Chinese detective Shang Wu and investigator Liu Decheng of the Avenue de Swardt Police Station arrested four suspects from Suzhou, Wang Gensheng; local, Xu Abao; Hangzhou, Shi Zusheng; and Tongzhou, Wu Sibao, and found a murder axe. Yong person Yang Liangrong, and Xia Chengliang who surrendered with Chen Tingrui lawyer, were sent to the First Special District Court for questioning. The details were reported in this newspaper. The debate concluded, awaiting sentencing. Yang and Xia each paid a shop security of 1,000 yuan. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiao Xiefen came to the second criminal court and sentenced Wang Gensheng and Xu Abao to death for the crime of conspiring to murder. Shi Zusheng was sentenced to life imprisonment for inciting murder, and Wu Sibao was sentenced to life imprisonment for helping to murder. The murder axe was confiscated. Yang Liangrong and Xia Chengliang were acquitted.</p>

<p>=Tang Huan-guang Coveted by Gangsters=</p>
<p>=Blackmail Letter Demanding a Huge Sum of 50,000 Yuan=</p>
<p>Tang Huan-guang, a Cantonese man, lives near the Tangjiawan vegetable market in the western gate of Nanshi. He is of modest means and lives extravagantly. He was targeted by gangsters and received two blackmail letters sent by post on the 30th of last month and the 1st of this month. The letters were signed Li Amao, demanding a value of 50,000 yuan, and instructed him to place a reply letter in the wastepaper basket at the intersection of the northern end of the Caoxie Bay Road, Lujiabang Road, Nanshi, near the Zhang Changxing Gate on the 11th day of the lunar month from 5:00 to 7:00 PM, and forbade him from reporting it to the police. At that time, Tang wrote a letter as agreed and put it in the designated wastepaper basket, saying, "The amount in the letter is too large" and he could not raise the money. If it was a smaller amount, he could help." The gangsters then sent another letter requesting him to hand over the money in the wastepaper basket next to No. 201, opposite the Yukang cigarette paper shop in Lujiabang Caoxie Bay from 6:00 to 7:00 PM. This was discovered by detective Wang Yongliang of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, who immediately reported it to captain Lu Ying. They dispatched leader Gu Liancheng and others, disguised as rickshaw pullers and garbage pickers, together with the police chief of the first section, to lie in ambush around the area. Before long, four people came slowly. As one person reached into the wastepaper basket, Detective Gu and others rushed forward and arrested all four of them. After questioning, they confessed that their names were Zhang Bucai (25 years old, from Funing), Zhu Zhusheng (22 years old, from Tongzhou), Lu Hongfu (28 years old, from Yancheng), and Zhang Zhengtang (43 years old, from Jiangbei). They also confessed the address of their accomplice, Liu Erqun. The original detectives rushed to No. 12 Caoxie Bay Road, Lujiabang, and arrested Liu and escorted him to the team for further investigation.</p>

<p>=Anti-Japanese is His Original Aspiration=</p>
<p>=Shining Shoes is Self-Reliance=</p>
<p>Since the news of Jiang Minsheng, an anti-Japanese general, shining shoes in Shanghai was released, all compatriots have paid great attention. Some sent letters of condolence, and some went to offer gifts. Central News Agency reporters interviewed Liu Daoxing, a representative of Chengyun, about this matter. According to Liu, Mr. Jiang Minsheng is not only an anti-Japanese general but also a comrade of our party. He had been engaged in secret work in the eastern provinces for many years. After the September 18th Incident, he served as a staff officer in Ding Chao's department. He also participated in the fierce anti-Japanese battles of Ma Su, Li Wangcheng and various other departments. He fought in three provinces and escaped death many times. It is fair to call him an anti-Japanese hero. Coming to Shanghai this time, he gave up everything and relied on his own efforts, which is particularly heroic. Jiang is very familiar with the organization of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army and its anti-Japanese process. He is very willing to return to the East to work, and he does not care about his personal status at all. He is completely a man of action who does not like to talk. I hope that Jiang will achieve his goal soon and serve the country.</p>

<p>=Secretly Used Black Clothes to Carry the Child's Body Out=</p>
<p>=Returned Alone and Was Discovered by Neighbors=</p>
<p>Yang Xiteng, the second landlord of Tianluyuan candy store at No. 209, Caishi Road, in the French Concession, sublet a three-story pavilion room to Zhao Xia, an old Ningbo woman, last August in the lunar calendar. The woman claimed that her husband had died early, leaving behind a son and a daughter. The son, Xiu Zhang, 19 years old, works as a laundryman in Zhabei. The daughter, Xiuying, 23 years old, married a man named Wang, but Wang died of illness in less than a year. Because Xiuying had no children, she adopted a two-year-old girl named Fudi last year and entrusted her to her mother, Zhao Xia. Xiuying now works as a female worker in a cigarette factory in Zhabei due to her livelihood and does not often visit her mother. However, Xia is naturally fierce and violent. Whenever Fudi cried, she would beat her severely. As time went on, Fudi became frightened and ill. Xia remained indifferent for a month. Recently, her condition became more serious and she was about to die. Until about 8:00 PM the night before last, Fudi suddenly cried again. Xia took a piece of firewood and struck her violently, hitting her head squarely and killing her suddenly. When Xia saw that she had caused a disaster, she remained silent and secretly used a black garment to cover the child's head and carry her out secretly. At that time, the candy store clerk saw her carrying the child out, but did not pay attention to it at first. When he saw Xia returning alone, he became suspicious. Recalling the woman's abuse of the child on weekdays and the woman's hasty departure just now, he became even more suspicious. Out of caution, the second landlord, Yang Xiteng, went to report to the police station. The police chief immediately dispatched a Bao detective to question the woman. Xia was mumbling and unable to form words, so she was taken into the police station. After repeated interrogation, the woman confessed the truth. However, as for the child's body, she claimed that she had entrusted a porter to carry it away for burial for two yuan. However, after the Bao detective went to investigate in person, he never found it. The police station believed that Xia was inhuman and ordered her to be detained, pending delivery to the Second Special District Court for severe punishment.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests Exemption from Jiangwan Township Boat Tax <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday presented a report to the Municipal Government, saying: "A report is submitted based on the circumstances. On the second day of February, the Jiangwan Branch Office reported that the Fair Brick and Tile Shop and other shops sent a letter saying that the Municipal Finance Bureau had recently sent people to Jiangwan to collect boat tax, which the boat households could not afford, and requested them to forward the exemption. The river channel in the area has been in disrepair for a long time and is increasingly silted up. It can barely be passable during the two floods each month. The boat households have long regarded it as a scourge. All the boats that come and go mostly come from the interior to transport goods for sale, or villagers go to the town to load goods and return. Now, if they are ordered to pay for licenses, the boat households do not know why. Not only is transportation hindered, but also the market is affected. As in the past, small cars traveling within the Wusong area are exempt from licenses for six months. Another example is that there are changed measures that do not require licenses for cattle, sheep, and pigs that are driven in rural areas. All of this proves that the same licensing regulations may be handled flexibly in urban and rural areas. It is reasonable to submit a report for review, transfer it to the Municipal Government, and grant an exemption, which is truly convenient for the public." In view of the fact that the river channel in the district is silted up and rural boats can only pass through two floods each month, it is already difficult for rural towns to trade. If boat taxes are imposed again, rural boats will inevitably disappear, and the market will also stagnate. The branch office proposed to exempt small car donations for six months and livestock does not need a license. It is hoped that the Xiangchuan tax could also be relieved to revive township business. It is appropriate to transfer the situation and hope that the government will review it, order the bureau to approve the exemption of the aforementioned Xiangchuan donations, so as to show the recovery, which is truly convenient for the public.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the Bell Body Remains Intact as Before</p>
<p>Shanghai News Agency: The ancient bell tower of the Mingxin Temple in North Bridge is a rare historical site in Shanghai County. It was built in the 14th year of the Ming Dynasty (Wanli). Due to years of disrepair and exposure to wind, frost, and rain, it had long collapsed, leaving only a skeletal frame supporting the ancient bell, which stood tall by the roadside. The bell is made of bronze and weighs 3,600 catties. Gentlemen in Shanghai County have raised funds to build a new bell tower next to the county government. The construction has not yet been completed. Unexpectedly, the old bell suddenly collapsed at 4:00 PM on the 2nd of this month amidst the howling wind and rain. The sound was as loud as thunder in a valley, shocking nearby residents. Fortunately, no pedestrians were passing by, so no one was injured. The bell body is also intact as before, which is also fortunate.</p>

<p>Our country is very rich in tungsten, accounting for 80% of the world's total. Tungsten is very important for modern military industrial needs and is the basic raw material for manufacturing light bulbs. However, without large-scale factories and experienced and knowledgeable talents, it is not easy to refine. Therefore, it is difficult to start without government leadership and creation. Hu Xiyuan, the general manager of China Yabu Electric Appliance Factory, once requested the Ministry of Industry to handle the tungsten refining factory during the organization of tungsten ore. The details have been published in previous reports. After receiving Hu's plan, the Ministry of Industry appreciated it very much. Now we have learned that the approval document reads: "The report is known. The Ministry is already planning to organize tungsten mining, including refining, and plans to promote it gradually. If the manufacturer is willing to cooperate in preparing for the refining business, the Ministry will give special convenience. Please inform immediately." It is heard that Hu plans to go to Beijing soon to present to Minister Chen regarding various plans for the tungsten refining plant.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Old Companies Supplement Registration Deadline Ends at the End of the Month <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>No Extension</p>
<p>The Company Law has been implemented since July 1, 1931, for more than two years. Although the number of companies that can apply for registration according to the law has increased day by day, the number of companies that are not familiar with the law, do not know the procedures, and have not registered is still quite large. Therefore, the Ministry of Industry has repeatedly ordered all provincial and municipal bureaus to order all companies in the country to register according to the law within a time limit, and set September 30 of this year as the last deadline. After this extension, there will be no further extension. The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, as the government agency in charge of company registration, immediately ordered the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and announced it to all companies in the city after receiving the ministry's order, and required them to register within the time limit. Now, the deadline is approaching. It is heard that there are still many companies in the city that have not registered. When the time comes, the Bureau of Social Affairs will strictly investigate. Once discovered, the directors, supervisors, shareholders, and promoters who are running the company will be fined up to 500 yuan, and they will be strictly investigated. There are not many days left. Companies that have not registered should rush to complete the registration procedures to avoid being fined.</p>

<p>=New Hospital on Hongqiao Road to be Completed Around the End of the Year=</p>
<p>=Sunlight in All Wards from Morning to Dusk=</p>
<p>The Shanghai Tuberculosis Sanatorium, located at 2 Daxi Road in this city, is a specialized hospital for treating tuberculosis. Since implementing various surgical procedures, the treatment results have become even more superior, far exceeding the ordinary internal medicine treatments of the past involving medication and injections. In recent years, in light of societal developments, the original hospital site is no longer sufficient. Therefore, two new-style sanatoriums are being built on Hongqiao Road in western Shanghai. The characteristic feature is that all wards face south, and each room has a separate balcony for reclining and resting. The entire hospital is equipped with fireproof and soundproof installations. In addition to necessary facilities such as operating rooms, electrotherapy rooms, and laboratories, there are also lounges, dining rooms, reading rooms, music rooms, and rooftop gardens. A large solarium is also set up, with sunlight shining in from morning until dusk. In terms of accommodations, in addition to first and second class, there are also free wards and several third-class isolation wards to meet the needs of ordinary patients. All the wards are expected to be completed by the end of this year. Currently, to promote the popularization of tuberculosis prevention and treatment knowledge, the hospital is offering free books published by the Chinese Tuberculosis Society, such as "Tuberculosis Treatment Methods," "Tuberculosis Prevention Methods," and "Special Tuberculosis Treatment Methods," compiled by Ding Fubao and Ding Huikang based on experience. Those who send a letter requesting these books should enclose four cents for postage per book.</p>

<p>Civil Lawsuit Transferred to Civil Court</p>
<p>Hu Yuquan, from Wuxi, stole electricity at the Jinling Restaurant located at 419 Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession at approximately 3:00 AM on the 19th of last month. Detectives Lu Changsheng, Bao Zhou Xianglin, Chen Yishan, and others from the French police station discovered this and apprehended Hu, seizing all the equipment. Cen Wenhuan, an accomplice from the restaurant, was also taken into custody. It was also discovered that Hu had colluded with Shen Ahai, who is still at large, to steal electricity from the Huabin Hotel at 6 Hongyun Lane, Rue Wagner last August. Therefore, the hotel owner, Wu Ziheng, was arrested and brought to the Second Special District Court for trial. The electric company also sent representatives to file a case, claiming that the company had suffered significant losses since the theft began. Now, it has been determined that the Jinling Restaurant's electricity theft resulted in a loss of 6,344 yuan and 82 cents, and Wu Ziheng of 6 Hongyun Lane suffered a loss of 218 yuan and 18 cents. They requested to attach a civil lawsuit for recovery of the losses. After the debate concluded, Judge Wu Fanglian sentenced Hu Yuquan to two months' imprisonment for each of the two counts of theft, to be served concurrently for three months. Cen Wenhuan was sentenced to a fine of 100 yuan for receiving stolen goods, and Wu Ziheng was fined 50 yuan for receiving stolen goods. The portion of the plaintiff's request for an attached civil lawsuit was transferred to the civil court for adjudication.</p>

<p>Zheng Tangsheng and Twelve Others</p>
<p>Judge Li to Hold Special Trial on the 6th</p>
<p>Twelve male and female members of a major kidnapping gang, including Zheng Tangsheng, Shang Zhen, and Geng Huatang, who were previously arrested by special agents of the French police in Tianjin, were brought to Shanghai and sent to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and investigation. This matter has been reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that after an investigation by the police, it was determined that these bandits were involved in five kidnapping cases in Shanghai, including the kidnapping of Huang Yuyi, the deputy director of the Zhongnan Bank, Chen Yanghe, the deputy manager of the Siming Bank, He Shaoting, the owner of the Xinsen lumberyard, Gu Zelin, the son of Yunnan Division Commander Gu Zizhen, and Huang Baohua of 4 Route Ghisi. They divided the ransom money among themselves. In Tianjin, they kidnapped Liang Huiwu, a wealthy merchant, and killed him after receiving the ransom, burying the body in the garden at 40 Route 38 in the British Concession. They also kidnapped Chen Zhuling, a comprador of Jardine Matheson, killed him after receiving the ransom, and buried the body under the floorboards at 4 Xiangzhi Lane and 4 Baokang Lane in the British Concession. The Tianjin police have already exhumed both bodies. The trial was originally scheduled to begin formally yesterday morning. However, due to the large number of defendants and the complexity of the case, Judge Li Changnian announced that a special court would be opened at 1:00 PM on the 6th for the trial.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Shen Zixiang Recruits in the Name of the Jiangpu Drug Enforcement Office <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Suspected of Fraud, Arrested by Police</p>
<p>Shen Zixiang, a 21-year-old from Ningbo Feng hua, formerly worked in education. Recently, Shen suddenly claimed to be the director of the West District Office of the Jiangpu County Drug Enforcement Office of Jiangsu Province. He rented a room at 288 Maigen Road, the location of the Shenmei Girls' Middle School, and placed an advertisement in the News on the 26th of last month, recruiting 25 male and female staff members with a monthly salary of 30 yuan. However, applicants were required to pay an application fee of one yuan each, and the official examination was scheduled for the 3rd of this month. Since the advertisement was published, many unemployed people flocked to register and pay the fee. In the past few days, the number reached over a hundred people, all of whom were personally received by Shen, who issued receipts instructing them to wait for the examination. However, this matter came to the attention of the Jiangsu Provincial Drug Enforcement Office, which stated that it did not have a West District Office and had not entrusted Shen Zixiang to publish advertisements for recruitment. It was suspected that he was falsely using the name to collect money. Therefore, Supervising Officer Shao Ziying was specially dispatched to Shanghai the day before yesterday to conduct a secret investigation. He also went to Shen at the Fanmei Middle School, posing as an applicant and paying the application fee of one yuan on the spot. At that time, Zhang Shunnian and Li Zhichao were also there to register and pay the fee. Shen issued receipts to all of them. Supervising Officer Shao confirmed the facts and reported to the Gordon Road Police Station, which dispatched Chinese Detective Pi Shaochang and Western Detective Lai Yin to arrest Shen. They confiscated a letter of appointment, three receipt books, a newspaper, a notice, and a bundle of career battle letters, and brought them to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Summary Court of the First Special District Court. Police Lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated the above facts and presented all the confiscated items as evidence, accusing the defendant Shen Zixiang of fraud under Article 363, Section 1 of the Criminal Law. Supervising Officer Shao Ziying of the Jiangsu Provincial Drug Enforcement Office testified that after reading the defendant's advertisement claiming to be the director of the West District Office and recruiting staff, he was sent to Shanghai to investigate and also registered and paid one yuan to apply. However, all branch office directors in our office are appointed by Section Chief Shen alone, and he has not instructed the defendant to publish advertisements for recruitment. The director of the Jiangpu County Drug Enforcement Office is Dong Changfu, etc. Zhang Shunnian and Li Zhichao also testified that they went to report and paid one yuan each, and the defendant issued receipts. When questioned, Shen Zixiang confessed that he was appointed as the director of the West District Office by Team Leader Wang of the Jiangpu County Drug Enforcement Office and agreed with Director Dong Changfu of the office to handle the West District drug enforcement matters, stipulating that he would report 50 yuan per month in addition to all expenses. Therefore, he published advertisements to recruit male and female staff, and each person would pay an application fee of one yuan. However, if they were not selected, the application fee would be refunded. He stated that he had contacted Director Dong about this matter, and Dong was the branch director of Jiangpu County, so the Jiangsu Provincial Headquarters would naturally not know about it. Judge Wu Xiangzu reviewed the confession and believed that the investigation of Dong Changfu was very important to this case, so it was necessary to postpone the hearing. He ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and wait for Team Leader Wang to be summoned to court for further questioning at a later date.</p>

Wu Dayou, an employee of that pawnshop, delivered the goods to Ruikang Pawnshop, where Wang issued a receipt promising to pay for them later. Unexpectedly, Wang took the diamond rings to the Anyu Pawnshop on Sanma Road, mortgaged them for over 2,000 yuan, and spent the money. Wu Dayou found out and demanded payment, but Wang ignored him. Therefore, he reported to the police station, and Wang was arrested and sent to the Second Special District Court on charges of fraud. Yesterday, Judge Wu interrogated him in the Eighth Criminal Court. The police lawyer explained the case, and Wang Zhen confessed to pawning the rings and spending the money. Judge Sun reviewed the confession and sentenced Wang Zhen to a fine of 60 yuan for fraud as a warning.</p>

<p>The defendants claimed there was no exchange of money.</p>
<p>On July 17 of this year, the Shanghai Education Bureau held a summer graduation examination for various schools. It was discovered at the test site at Great China University that Xie Ying, a high school student from Jianguo Middle School, had used illegal means to obtain the test questions in advance, which caused the students from various schools taking the test to protest and boycott the test. The authorities immediately reported this to the Public Security Bureau, and Xie Ying, his brother Xie Zhen, and Zhang Jieliang were detained and sent to the Shanghai District Court. After preliminary examination by the prosecutor, they were formally charged with crimes such as encroachment and incitement. A trial was held, Zhang Jieliang was taken into custody, Xie Ying was sent to New Puyu Hall for medical treatment due to illness, and Xie Zhen was released on bail of 500 yuan. Yesterday morning at 9 o'clock, Judge Qian Chengjun of the criminal court opened the third courtroom for the trial. Each defendant hired a lawyer to defend them in court. Judge Qian ordered the case to be re-examined. First, Xie Ying was brought before the court. He stated that he was 20 years old, from Haining, Zhejiang, and was studying in the second year of high school at Jianguo Middle School in Zhabei, Shanghai, and lived on campus. He was asked if he had ever been in legal trouble before, and he replied no. He was asked who Xie Zhen was, and he replied that he was his older brother. He was asked about his brother's occupation, and he replied that his brother worked in the advertising department of the Central Daily News in Nanjing. He was asked that since he was a student in the third year of high school at Jianguo Middle School, who had given him the examination questions. He replied that his older brother had given them to him. He was asked what day it was, and he replied June 13. He was asked how many questions there were, and he replied three, for English, history, and biology, and his brother gave them to him in person because his family's financial situation was tight and he had dropped out of school for two years. He was asked if he had requested these questions from his brother or if his brother had given them to him. He replied that he had not requested them. He was asked if he knew Zhang Jieliang, and he replied that he did. He was asked that since he was a third-year high school student, how could he do such a thing and if he knew what Zhang Jieliang did for a living. He replied that he knew that he worked in a printing factory in Nanjing. Xie Zhen was then brought before the court. He stated that he was 32 years old, from Haining, and currently resided at the Zhongzhou Hotel on Simalu. He currently worked in the advertising department of the Central Daily News in Nanjing. Xie Ying was his younger brother. He was asked how many questions he had given to his brother, and he replied three, for history, biology, and English. He was asked where he had obtained these questions, and he replied that Zhang Jieliang had written them out. He was asked if he had given these questions to his brother, and he replied yes. He was asked why he had given them to his brother, and he replied that he hoped he would graduate. He was asked if Zhang Jieliang was a relative or a friend, and he replied that he was from the same hometown. He was asked when Zhang Jieliang had given him the questions, and he replied on the morning of June 12. He was asked if he had paid any money, and he replied no. Zhang Jieliang stated that he was 20 years old, from Haining, and worked as a proofreader at a printing factory in Nanjing.

He was asked how many questions he had copied out, and he replied three, for English, biology, and history. He was asked when he had shown them to Xie Zhen, and he replied before noon on June 12. He was asked why he had copied them out, and he replied that he was curious. He was asked if he knew who Xie Zhen had given them to, and he replied that he did not. He was asked if he had copied them out because he was a proofreader, and he replied yes. He was asked why he, and not the Education Bureau proofreader, was proofreading. He replied that they proofread first, and then the Education Bureau proofread. He was asked if Xie Zhen had asked him to do it beforehand, and he replied no. He was asked if he had asked Xie Zhen for money, and he replied no. The judge ruled that the case still required witnesses to be summoned.

<p>The newly appointed Deputy Director of the Education Department of the Municipal Council, Mr. Chen Xuanshan, assumed his duties on September 1. Yesterday, the reporter visited Mr. Chen at the Education Department of the Municipal Council to inquire about the education situation in the concession. According to his account, the number of school-age children in the concession has been increasing in recent years, leading to a shortage of capacity in the existing primary and secondary schools. In order to popularize education in the concession, the Municipal Council plans to add primary and secondary schools year by year within the possible scope, according to the original plan, so that school-age children in the concession can avoid being turned away. Regarding subsidies for private schools, negotiations are currently underway with the Municipal Education Bureau. Once a result is obtained, it can be implemented. However, the Municipal Council will designate the use of the subsidy funds. The existing primary and secondary schools in the concession are mostly makeshift due to limited funding, and various facilities are also incomplete. The Municipal Council also plans to reform and enrich them.</p>

<h3 id="e191">Vocational Education Society Establishes Rural Service Specialization Course <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>The China Vocational Education Society runs rural education programs, which use little money and achieve great results, earning sympathy from all sides. Recently, feeling the lack of rural talent, it established a Rural Service Specialization Course. It purchased more than 100 mu of land in the countryside of Caohejing in the western suburbs of Shanghai and developed it into a farm, designating more than 30 villages as practice sites. It recruits high school graduates with experience in serving rural areas and provides them with two years of special training in education, economics, and self-governance to cultivate rural service talents with both knowledge and skills to meet social needs. Since it started advertising for enrollment, many people have submitted self-written essays and applied for registration, and many have resigned from their original positions to request admission. The Admissions Office has carefully reviewed and responded to each application separately. It is understood that the course also stipulates that students will be assigned positions by the Society upon graduation. If their abilities are insufficient, they can still stay on the farm to work and live self-sufficiently to avoid unemployment. Those who are interested in rural careers and seek a way out for the nation can attach a two-cent stamp and send a letter to the Society at No. 80 Hualong Road, Shanghai, to request the course brochure.</p>

Countries around the world are competing to translate it. It is now translated by Mr. Gao Zhixiang and includes five of the most valuable recent agricultural data, with eight illustrations.

<p>Shanghai Wins Half of the Eight Championships and Takes the Overall Championship</p>
<p>Accidents Occur in Ball Games, Championships Evenly Distributed</p>
<p>Ding Yuhua of Shanghai Wins First Place in Women's Athletics</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Fifth Administrative District Games opened on September 1. Details of the track and field events on the first day have been reported in various newspapers. The reporter predicted that the meeting would be postponed due to the wind and rain on the 2nd and 3rd, so he went there yesterday. Unexpectedly, the ball games were held in the storm, and the players left unhappily due to disputes between the players. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>IP&gt;Total Track and Field Points</p>
<h3 id="e207">Group Part <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>(1) The first place in the total score of men's track events is Shanghai with 43 points, the second is Nanhui with 28 points, and the third is Chuansha with 12 points. (2) Nanhui and Chuansha each have 28 points in the total score of men's field events. According to the regulations, Nanhui has more first place finishes, so the championship goes to Nanhui, and the second place is Shanghai with 21 points. (3) The first place in the total score of women's track and field events is Shanghai with 421 points, the second is Chuansha with 5 points, and the third is Nanhui with 0 points.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Personal Scores <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>(1) Men's Track Total Points: First Place - Song En (South), Wang Changsheng (Shanghai), 13 points each; Second Place - Tao Shaosheng (South), Huang Hanru (Shanghai), 10 points each; Third Place - Zheng Guanhai (Sichuan), 6 points.

<h3 id="e209">Game Situation <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>▲Dispute Occurred: This time, the association's ball games included four types: football, basketball, volleyball, and tennis. Chuansha only participated in basketball and volleyball. Therefore, apart from basketball and volleyball using an elimination system, both football and tennis were matches between Shanghai and Nanhui. Considering the power balance, Shanghai was expected to win. This led to the demoralization of athletes from Nanhui and Chuansha counties, which was the main reason for the dispute. On the 2nd of this month, with wind and rain, the competition committee announced that volleyball would be played in the morning. Shanghai athletes requested a postponement due to the strong wind and light balls. Shanghai refused to join during the draw, and the organizing committee decided to play at 12 o'clock. Shanghai county athletes, as it was lunchtime, did not arrive. The organizing committee declared Shanghai county's forfeit, causing resentment.</p>
<p>▲Emergency Meeting: The organizing committee convened an emergency meeting at 1 pm that afternoon. All committee members attended. Chairman Cao Zhenfei immediately decided that the basketball games would start at 4 pm on the 2nd for the first game, and 5:15 pm for the second. Tennis would start at 9 am on the 3rd, and football at 1 pm on the 3rd. However, regarding the volleyball issue, Nanchuan counties insisted that Shanghai county had forfeited, while Shanghai county firmly opposed, leading to no resolution.</p>
<p>▲Basketball Game: At 4 pm on the 3rd, the three counties' basketball athletes followed the organizing committee's decision, each preparing for battle. Despite the wind and rain, none were negligent. After the draw, Shanghai and Chuansha faced off first. At the sound of the whistle, both sides formed their formations and ended at 5:10 pm. As a result, Shanghai defeated Chuansha. (The association official in charge of records refused to disclose the score.) Shanghai county athletes, having just finished a fierce battle, were exhausted. However, as the time for the second game had arrived, they reluctantly fought and were defeated by Nanhui. The basketball championship was thus won by Nanhui.</p>
<p>▲Opposing Postponement: The wind and rain did not subside on the 3rd. Shanghai county proposed postponing the games, but was opposed by Chuansha and Nanhui counties. Consequently, at 9 am, tennis athletes from Nanhui and Nanchuan entered the field, but the referees were suddenly absent, leading to problems. At 1 pm for the football game, the referees were again absent. The athletes could only wait for a resolution helplessly.</p>
<p>▲Distributing Prizes: The ball games, football, volleyball, and tennis, all had no results, as mentioned above. Nanchuan counties neither advocated for a postponement nor insisted on returning to their counties on the 3rd. This made resolving the championship issue impossible. The organizing committee held another meeting. As a result, the three unplayed championships were evenly distributed. The volleyball championship was awarded to Chuansha, the tennis championship to Nanhui, and the football championship to Shanghai. The turmoil subsided. In the afternoon, the three counties' athletes boarded cars after Commissioner Cao presented the awards. They departed in the pouring rain. During the farewell, some cheered, while others cursed from the three cars, truly an interesting final entertainment.</p>

<p>Due to Conflict with the National Games Schedule</p>
<p>Held at the Beijing Sports Field on the 10th and 20th</p>
<p>The Municipal Government of this city, previously approved the Central National Arts Museum's telegram, stating that the second National Arts Examination was originally scheduled to be held on the 10th of the 20th year, but was postponed due to national crisis, and both requests were telegraphed and approved. Now, this museum cites the case and requests the National Government to approve the holding of the second National Examination on October 16th of this year, immediately after the conclusion of the National Games competition at its venue. It should be requested to notify the affiliated units and inform the number of applicants for the National Examination before September 10th, with the number not exceeding 30 people. Once the athletes are on their way, please issue a certificate of proof for them to negotiate with transportation agencies for half-price fares on domestic railways and ships, in order to show consideration. In addition to separate telegrams, it is urgently requested to investigate and handle the matter. Furthermore, a telegram from the Central National Arts Museum stated that the second National Arts Examination, originally scheduled to be held on October 16th of this year at the Central Sports Field, has already been telegraphed to you. Due to the simultaneous opening of the National Games, the time and location are slightly conflicting. After discussion by the preparatory committee for the second National Examination of this museum, it was decided to postpone it to October 20th and hold it at the Public Sports Field in Beijing. In addition to reporting for record, it is urgently requested to transfer the order to comply. The government immediately issued an order to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to cooperate with the Municipal National Arts Museum to comply.</p>

<h3 id="e220">Solving the Sexual Desires of Prisoners <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Drunkard</p>
<p>The judicial authorities have already decided on a method to solve the sexual desires of prisoners. However, according to my humble opinion, there are still some points that need to be discussed. I hereby raise them below:</p>
<p>(1) Violating the Eugenics Law: Germany's Hitler recently promulgated the "Eugenics Law" to improve the people's personality and ensure healthy bodies. All undesirable elements in society, such as criminals, the mentally ill, and those with hereditary diseases, must be prevented from reproducing or have their reproductive functions eliminated. This law will be implemented from January next year. Our country has a vast territory and a large population, so it is not possible to imitate this law. However, prisoners are naturally prevented from reproducing during their sentences. Allowing couples to meet once every two or three months is no different from encouraging reproduction. The children born to cruel and licentious people in harsh environments will naturally have no hope of "excellence," and their hereditary nature is truly frightening. Is this not in great contradiction with the "Eugenics Law"?</p>
<p>(2) No Need to Solve: As the saying goes, "Satiety breeds lust." This shows that a person's sexual desires only have a chance to be stimulated in a pleasant situation. As for prisoners who have committed crimes and are in confinement, they are experiencing the taste of iron bars. Their bodies and minds are suffering deeply. Where do they have the leisure to think about the "playing the lute under the yellow plum tree" kind of work? Therefore, it seems that there is no need to solve this sexual desire problem on their behalf.</p>
<p>(3) Unequal Treatment: This decree was originally intended to reward well-behaved prisoners. However, it is limited to formal couples. Other prisoners without husbands or wives, or those who are not formally married, are still left out in the cold and do not receive this treatment. Then, this solution is not a thorough solution and will instead arouse psychological inequalities and sexual urges among the other prisoners. Moreover, there are many other ways to reward them, so why use this difficult-to-universalize sexual activity as a reward?</p>
<p>The above three points do not seem to have been considered humanely. I have specially written them out for legal scholars to study. In short, solving the sexual desires problem seems to be "neglecting the root and pursuing the branch," which is not the most important plan at present. The most important thing is to improve the problems of diet, sanitation, hygiene, and all other long-standing abuses. Then, the prisoners will be able to receive real benefits.</p>
<h3 id="e221">Enlightenment from Catching Flies <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Nineteen</p>
<p>Autumn has arrived, and there are especially many autumn flies. This morning, during breakfast, I saw three or four flies flying around the table. I knew that they were our great enemies, so I quickly grabbed a fly swatter, aimed, and wanted to wipe them out in one fell swoop. Who knew that with a "whack," only one enemy died under my iron fist, and the rest escaped to who knows where. Although I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed at the time, I still sat quietly at the table, waiting for an opportunity to move. But they, like fish that slipped through the net, never came into my sight again. I couldn't help but throw down the fly swatter and let out a long sigh.</p>
<p>Flies are ignorant animals and seem to have no cunning. However, since humans invented the fly swatter, they have become more and more clever day by day. This is beyond our expectations. For example, in this fly-catching incident, one was deceived, and the rest harbored vigilance and avoided me. This is clear evidence. As the saying goes, "Those who have schemes must have cunning." This saying is very reasonable. To extend it further, the fly swatter is just a tool to treat the symptoms of catching flies. Trying to cure the root cause and purify the source with it will not have much effect. Because treating the symptoms is only a temporary solution, while curing the root cause and purifying the source is a permanent plan and will never be so simple. Therefore, I must admit that it was my mistake to think that I could wipe out all the flies with one swat. Catching flies is like this, and why should other things be any different? So finally, I want to quote a classical writer's style and say, "Gentlemen, from this, you can gain enlightenment!"</p>
<h3 id="e222">Inspired by a "Maid's" Beating <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Fu Yizhi</p>
<p>Lincoln believed that "slavery is based on unjust and bad policies," so he advocated that slave states join the Union. Although it triggered the historically famous Civil War, in the end, the Northern states achieved the final victory. Finally, on New Year's Day in 1863, he issued a declaration and implemented the emancipation of black slaves in the Southern states. This is indeed a memorable event in the history of human civilization.</p>
<p>China also often boasts of being an ancient civilized country in the world, but the buying and selling of slaves has not yet been abolished. Although with the high tide of the revolution, there was once a feverish shout of "liberation," names like "family members" and "book boys" seem to no longer exist. As for whether they exist in reality, that is another question. But the name of "maid" and the fact of keeping maids exist everywhere and cannot be concealed. However, this name and fact only exist in the groups of the bourgeois class.</p>
<p>Recently, I have rashly stepped on the edge of the small bourgeois lifestyle circle. What has made me feel most inexplicable is the number of female servants and bought maids in this lifestyle circle, which is beyond my usual imagination. Of course, more somber and tragic facts are also discovered. Not long ago, a "maid" in a certain house number ran away, implicating the "maid" of the next-door neighbor (a seventeen or eighteen-year-old girl) as a suspect. As a result, the neighbor's "maid" suffered, and was brutally beaten by her master for a minor reason. At the very least, she had to kneel for three hours, but she was not allowed to cry. Recently, people have not been allowed to watch. Occasionally, one or two dull-headed humanitarians stand up and shout a few "no's," but that's all they do. It is said that this little girl is waiting for someone to rescue her. If there is a swordsman-like figure who is willing to unleash his instincts and rescue this innocent and pitiful maid, I think his achievements are no less than Lincoln's.</p>
<p>Here, the problem has happened again. It is not difficult for us to rescue her from the cage. However, after she is out of the cage, what about her clothing, food, and shelter? Moreover, she is not the only maid, and she is probably not the only one being tortured. According to Kiku Kawa's explanation, nurses, elementary school teachers, etc., can all be called silver slaves. Then, slaves already account for the absolute majority in society, and I am still one of them in this slave circle. I am too busy to save myself, how dare I rashly talk about saving others? As I write this, I can't help but sigh repeatedly!</p>
<h3 id="e223">City Moon <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Chonglou</p>
<p>That clear like water, that bright like a mirror, that pure like a virgin's heart, isn't that the moon deeply imprinted in our hearts?</p>
<p>In the natural countryside, whenever the god of night spreads its wings, our moon gradually emerges from the mountains. It bathes in the light air, revealing a gentle smile. Then, the forests, streams, lawns, etc., are all covered with a layer of silver brilliance. All living things are active. Even the tiny mosquitoes sing and dance for it.</p>
<p>In the bustling city, electric lights and neon lights shine day and night. Tall buildings block the surroundings, preventing me from seeing the longed-for moon all night long. Sometimes I have to raise my feet and crane my neck to see that it is cramped on the roof, revealing a sad face. I want to comfort it and tell it my longing, but at this time, a burst of thick smoke will come out of the chimney on the roof, and then I can't even see its sad face!</p>
<p>The same moon appears dim in the city. "Moon! Don't sigh because of sadness, and don't grieve because of disappointment. You should know that this environment is fundamentally unsuitable for you. This is a world that needs another kind of moon."</p>
<h3 id="e224">From Hot to Cold <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Qiu</p>
<p>The climate has changed from hot to cold; the scenery will change from prosperity to desolation; the blood of animals has also changed from boiling to tranquility. This is the phenomenon that should occur when the hot summer passes and the new autumn arrives in the world.</p>
<p>In the past, the sun was scorching, and people were so hot that they had nowhere to go, relying entirely on ice cream and fresh orange juice to calm the fire in their hearts. Now that it is autumn, these things are no longer needed. Prepare to admire the bright autumn moon and eat the round mooncakes!</p>
<p>In the past, foreign insults were becoming more urgent every day, and the people of the country were filled with righteous indignation, relying entirely on shouting the slogan "Resist Japan and save the country" to relieve the anger in their chests. Now, the puppet troops are being incorporated one after another, and the Chahar incident has been resolved. The overall situation has been determined. The term "Resist Japan and save the country" is no longer mentioned frequently. Everyone is going to live in peace and prepare for singing and dancing!</p>
<p>The climate has changed from hot to cold, and people's blood has changed from hot to cold. Everything in China has also changed from hot to cold. Ah! Autumn is cold! Autumn is cold! No wonder the earth is so tranquil.</p>

<p>Chapter 14: Difficulty in Finding a Wife, Hesitation and Concern for the Future, Small Gathering with Friends, Remembering the Past</p>
<p>Guizhi said blankly, "What are you thinking? You said eating yuanxiao is okay, and I said eating yuanxiao, and you applaud." Manying laughed, "You feel very strange, don't you? If I explain it, you won't think it's strange. Yuanxiao is a symbol of reunion. You and Company Commander Zhao eating it together is the most..." Zhao Ziqiang said with a bitter smile, "Miss Huang, don't joke like that." Manying said, "Let me tell you the truth. After Company Commander Guan left yesterday, I arrived. Thanks to Old Lady Yang's kindness, she let me stay. I took this opportunity to run around Yang and Zhao's two houses, front and back yards, and brought up the marriage proposal. Old Lady Yang and Miss Yang," she said, gently patting Guizhi's shoulders twice, and laughed, "both expressed their approval." I said, 'Marriage nowadays is not a business marriage. Both the man and woman have to talk to each other themselves.' But although the two of you are neighbors, you haven't communicated much before. The first time, no one is embarrassed to ask the other out to talk. It's even more inconvenient at home. So I told Miss Yang that I would introduce you to each other in a place..." Guizhi gently touched his arm, glared at him, and said, "Did I say it was today?" Manying said, "Today is the same, tomorrow is the same, what does it matter what day it is." Tian Qing said seriously, "It's not about the day. Miss, you have to know that it's not easy for Miss Huang to come to Haidian. And when she comes, she doesn't necessarily run into our Big Brother Zhao. So today, taking advantage of the opportunity that everyone is gathered together, we arranged to talk here. It's not just for joking." Guizhi had nothing to say. The waiter came in and asked the two young ladies what they wanted. Guizhi rushed to answer, "I want a bowl of chatang." (Note: Fried millet flour, add sugar, and mix with water.) Huang Manying said, "Why not eat yuanxiao?" Guizhi laughed, "This is according to each person's preference. I like to eat chatang, why don't you let me eat it?" Manying said, "It's fine if you like to eat chatang. But I also want to order a bowl of yuanxiao for you. Company Commander Zhao, are you willing?" (178)</p>

<h3 id="e226">Cultivating Beauty <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>When I was a girl, an old nanny once told me earnestly, "Beauty is only skin deep." I always felt that this saying was superficial and not to be believed. Later, one day, my uncle added this to what the old nanny said: "But ugliness goes to the bone." Only then was its original meaning complete, and I suddenly understood, gaining considerable comfort. It is known that if girls like to talk, they should preserve this little vanity.</p>
<p>Nowadays, most mothers encourage their girls to cultivate beauty. This is indeed a good method because if girls pay considerable attention to their complexion, skin, teeth, and exercise when they are young, then they will certainly have a beautiful appearance and a healthy physique when they grow up. And there is also a most important point, which is that they will have a considerable understanding and proper maintenance of themselves.</p>
<p>I would like to guide every girl to pay attention to her hair. Spending ten minutes brushing hair every morning and evening is worth doing. I would like to encourage them to protect their skin, not only relying on the help of lotions or cosmetics, but also relying on the effects of practicing deep breathing and exercise, so that the skin reaches the state of being fair, smooth, moist, and tender. More fresh air will certainly make the skin fair, smooth, moist, and tender most effectively and noticeably. Now, sports in schools are very beneficial to children. However, if mothers and children practice prescribed exercises once every morning, such as calisthenics, then a pleasant life during the day and a beautiful appearance have already been successfully created.</p>
<p>As for teeth, schools also pay close attention to them, and there are considerable examinations. Pearl-like white teeth are indeed the glory of every girl, but toothbrushing training should begin in early childhood. When a child can just hold a toothbrush, they should be taught how to use the toothbrush, and then told why the mouth should be preserved in such a cautious, strict, clean, and healthy state. If mothers pay a little attention to their children's teeth and mouth, then half of their future illnesses can be avoided. Rinsing the mouth should also be taught to children, and they should also be taught to use a nasal irrigation method; by following this method, many severe colds can also be avoided.</p>
<p>Limited vanity can no longer be regarded as a sin, so finally, I am more willing to guide every girl to pay attention to her clothes, to give her an interest in clothing, to teach her to find the colors and styles that best suit her, and to let her draw up a clothing list when she is first able to manage her own clothes. At the same time, I would like to guide her to clean and organize her clothes, to teach her how to brush, how to fold, how to put away, and how to store them. (I would like to guide boys in the same way, knowing that a future daughter-in-law will definitely thank me very much.)</p>
<h3 id="e227">Clothes and Health <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Pei Yu</p>
<p>The important effect of clothing on the health of your children cannot be emphasized enough.</p>
<p>Clothes that are put on without buttons have many different disadvantages, the most obvious of which is making the chest narrow, the shoulders low and rounded, resulting in poor breathing and lack of nutrition. Tight and round collars easily cause earaches in children, and tight elastic waistbands can cause indigestion.</p>
<p>There are many causes of back pain in children, the most common of which is the use of suspenders. Suspenders that are so short and pull up the entire unbalanced body are most effective at causing back pain in children. Mothers should see that children who use suspenders are not very happy to play.</p>
<p>Children who use suspenders are not very happy to play.</p>
<p>Shoes are also very important; if the heels are too high (referring to leather shoes), then the child's center of gravity will often lean forward, which is enough to make the muscles of the calf excessively elongated. Excessive elongation means excessive exertion, and the result is that it is easy to have sprains.</p>
<p>Clothes that are too loose should also be avoided. So-called clothes that are too loose include work clothes that are so loose that they constantly slip off the shoulders, sleeves that are so long that they drag past the wrists, and socks whose tops constantly fall down.</p>

<h3 id="e228">Exchange Rate Rises Slightly, Continues to Fall by 4.2 Yuan <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>The gold market fluctuated extremely slightly yesterday. The morning session rose and fell by only 3.2 yuan, but the afternoon session was even narrower, with only a 1.3 yuan range. It was extremely idle. The US market still had to close, so the situation in the market remained wait-and-see. In the early morning, the UK silver rose slightly in foreign telegrams, and the US silver did not move. The exchange rate rose slightly across the board. The forward silver price at the Five Metals Exchange was suspended, as were US cotton, US wheat, and stocks. Therefore, the gross price opened slightly lower and then retreated to within 30 yuan. After the opening, the exchange market was quite firm. The HSBC Bank listed the British rate as flat, while the US rate rose by 0.125 and then continued to fall. After entering, many retailers tried to raise the price, and the domestic rate was also flat. Banks paid out for long positions and took in for short positions, so the gold price was extremely calm, with only a few cents of fluctuations. Trading was not active. Large traders generally waited and watched, and retailers were mostly in long positions, so they were calling for bids, and the trend was still stable. The situation throughout the day lacked special stimulation. The spot price was increased by 255 yuan. The spread for the September/October swap was 6.5 yuan.

<h3 id="e230">Silver Dollar Demand is Expected to Launch <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>This year's commercial depression in Shanghai has reached its peak. Natural disasters and man-made calamities have followed one after another, without end. The circulation of general goods seems to be hampered. Financial activity is also very different from the past. Finally, the market has become desolate, with no hope of revival. However, according to people in banking circles yesterday, since Minister Song returned to China, import and export business has suddenly shown a good sign. The turnover and adjustment of funds also have a promising outlook. Therefore, the beginning of this week seems to have a lively possibility. Although the interest rate for overnight loans in the market was still 8%, with the same price in the morning and afternoon, and an additional two to three cents of water was added, there were indeed many good news about actual demand. It is now in our eyes. There were also a particularly large number of check transactions yesterday. It is estimated that there were more than 5.3 million yuan in transfers, more than 1.1 million yuan in new transactions, more than 500,000 yuan in afternoon transactions, and more than 700,000 yuan in transactions in the Small General Association. For bank collections and settlements, foreign banks collected and settled more than 2.2 million yuan in check funds and more than 2.9 million yuan in silver dollars, various goods, exchange deposits, telegrams, and other collections and settlements of more than 5.3 million yuan in silver and more than 7.2 million yuan in silver dollars, special collections and settlements of more than 3.2 million yuan in silver, 700,000 yuan in silver stored in warehouses, and 1 million yuan in silver dollars. Chinese banks collected and settled more than 4 million yuan in check funds, 7.1 million yuan in various goods, exchange taxes, and other collections and settlements, 3.8-3.9 million yuan in special collections and settlements, and 500,000 yuan withdrawn from warehouses. Japanese banks had 300,000 silver dollars stored in warehouses and 600,000 yuan withdrawn from warehouses. The money shops collected and settled more than 44 million yuan in silver dollar public orders, more than 11 million yuan in silver dollar additional fees, and more than 900,000 yuan in remittances from various routes, and more than 100,000 yuan was settled in cash. Due to a large number of securities transactions by Chinese merchants, there were more than 1.8 million yuan in silver dollar deposit transactions, and only 300-400 thousand yuan was taken back and settled. It can be seen that the demand for silver dollars already has active signs. More than 3 million yuan in banknotes were recovered and issued, with 100,000 yuan coming from customers and 150,000 yuan going to the stomach. The new currency has reached more than 10 million in circulation in the market, it is said.</p>
<p>Also, the total number of exchanges at the Shanghai Clearing House on the 4th was 5,830,762.87 silver dollars, including 3,640,022.26 silver dollars in silver and 2,190,740.61 silver dollars in remittances.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the price of Jiangnan small silver dollars suddenly fell by 3 yuan to 841 yuan due to the small number of transactions and the sluggish situation. The price was the same in the morning and afternoon. The trading volume was 9,000 jiao in the morning and 4,000 jiao in the afternoon, and it was also caused by selling pressure. However, Guangdong small silver dollars had a large number of buy orders in the morning, which caused the price to rise sharply and extraordinarily, 2.5 yuan higher than the previous morning, to 790 yuan. In the afternoon, the market's confidence weakened, and the price returned to the original level of 787.5 yuan. The trading volume was 155,000 jiao in the morning and 70,000 jiao in the afternoon. Copper coins also rose by 1,000, to 315,000. The number of transactions decreased, only 35,200 strings, estimated to be worth 11,200 yuan in silver dollars.</p>
<h3 id="e232">Overnight Interest Rates Still Owed <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>The interest rate for overnight loans last month was sluggish, and the total amount for the whole day was less than the original amount by more than 20%. Therefore, at the recent meeting of the Money Industry Association, the proposal for the deposit interest rate was still 2.95 yuan, deducting the owed interest, and adding it according to the fixed price of 4.5 yuan. There was no increase or decrease in the market in July, so the highest owed interest was no more than 10.05 yuan and 11 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e233">Securities and Bond Markets Continue in a Calm Process <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange has resumed the two sessions in the morning and afternoon yesterday, and the trading is still very quiet. The market price has not risen or fallen. Most eyes are focused on the Lushan Conference. This conference is being held after Finance Minister Song returned to China and should be valued. There are rumors in the market that the government plans to pledge 50 million yuan to the financial sector for US-transported cotton and wheat. If this becomes a reality, the bond market will be indirectly affected. In the midst of this vague and confusing news, people's minds are becoming more chaotic, and large investors are becoming more wait-and-see. The market was extremely flat in the two sessions yesterday morning, with almost no rise or fall. The high and low prices were generally only about 0.1 yuan apart. The market is in a state of idleness and slackness, and the half-day trading volume is less than 1.5 million. The opening of the afternoon session was still very stable, and most of the prices remained the same, with no rise or fall. It was considered valuable that ship number 47 was slightly bought in 20 rolls at the closing and rose by 0.25 yuan. The rest were relatively firm. As a result, the market prices for the whole day saw both increases and decreases, but only by 0.1-0.2 yuan. The total turnover was 4,275,000. No spot trades were made at all. Futures trading was most active in 96, with only 1,005,000 yuan. The combined salt tax was 1,325,000, demobilization was 430,000, the 1919 Customs was 250,000, and 20 rolls of the 1920 Customs was 1,015,000. The rest were only in the tens of thousands. The editing was not opened for the whole day.</p>

<p>A slight rise in the yarn market is emerging, due to the continuous purchase of bullish orders, causing the market to tighten. However, the overseas yarn market is flat, and there is no major development in real demand. The economic situation in various regions is still dry, and it is difficult for commerce to improve. However, some people hope that the prices will rebound after a long period of decline.</p>

<p>The cotton market opened in the morning with a slightly tight market situation due to bullish activity and purchases caused by the wind and rain yesterday, which damaged the cotton fields. In the afternoon, it was heard that the center of this typhoon had not arrived, and the direction of the winds was along the coastline. Fortunately, the scope of the cotton fields that were damaged was not expanded, and the news about US cotton was flat. According to Japanese estimates, the second US cotton report will increase by about 13.36 million bales, and the new cotton on the market in various regions is quite abundant, and farmers are selling at very low prices due to economic difficulties.</p>

<p>The Zhengzhou standard market opened in the morning with a rise of 0.2 yuan in each month due to bullish activity caused by the typhoon passing through the area.

<p>The past week has completely followed the overseas cotton market, but there has not been much change. Japan's boycott of Indian cotton is still very strong. According to the weekend report, the amount exported to that country has increased compared to the same period last year, but these transactions were all determined before the boycott. On the spot market, inquiries from Europe are better, and transactions with China are insignificant. The harvest situation has made considerable progress, and light rain is expected this month. The summary for the past week is appended below (unit: thousands of bales):</p>
<p>1932 1933</p>

<h3 id="e241">Grain Market is Calm, Rice Prices Plunge by More Than 0.1 Yuan <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source suddenly surged, with more than 80 numbers, mostly with Bo Dao, and although there was Beiyang help to handle the stomach, nearly 2,000 packages, the market situation was exhausted due to the oversupply. Qingjiao, Songsi, Fenglian, and Bo Dao all depreciated by more than 0.1 yuan. As for the Changbang, Sutongbang, and other japonica and Du Yangjian, although there are endless zero stomachs, the market price is also 0.1 yuan. Only Nangang Thick Rice is stable due to lack of goods, and the price is the same as the yuan. Yinyuan with Xiuhe New Japonica has little change, and Changdong New Return fell by 0.1 yuan, and the price opened at 7.2 yuan.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of various routes under the river was prosperous, about 40 numbers, and there were few kinds of stomachs on the market. The price of Baigeng was slightly 0.1-0.2 yuan, the middle and second grade of Bo Dao were high and straight, and the price of Xinchen Yangjian, Xinke Jian, Jiaobai Jian, and Chen Du Jian remained unchanged. Bai Yuan was stable, and Dongxin Japonica was similar to the previous market.</p>
<h3 id="e242">New Guest Indica Rice Continues to Fall <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>Minbang's Handling is Waiting and Seeing</p>
<p>Yesterday, new Guest Indica rice continued to be transported from Hunan and Huocao, and there were still several batches of new rice from Hunan being transported, because the production price was already low, and small vendors were all trying to install it, so there will be arrivals in the near future. There are also many new rice from Nanjing transported by train to the local area of Nanjing and Anhui Province in Jiangbei. Therefore, people's minds are weak, and because the Communist bandits are spreading in various places in Fujian Province, and commercial stagnation, Minbang has the stomach but does not dare to handle it smoothly. The ship to Fujian yesterday had other reasons and could not completely load rice. The market price of each indica rice was 0.1 yuan. The price of 500 packages of Hunan Jijin was initially 6.5 yuan due to the low price, and then reduced to 6.437 yuan, of which Fuzhou only handled more than 200 packages of Jing Indica rice, and the rest were handled by Quanzhou.</p>
<h3 id="e243">Flour Standard Begins to Stabilize and Then Falls <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>After the opening of the flour market yesterday morning, the prices in each month showed a trend of first stabilizing and then falling. Because the quotation of foreign wheat was suspended and there were no reports, the market sentiment was still stable at the beginning. After that, the sales in Tianjin stagnated again after the market price increased by a few points. This situation is the main reason for the sluggishness of the flour market. Therefore, some large and small factories frequently issued blocks for the near and distant futures, and those in the Tianjin gang who were familiar with the situation also returned and issued a lot, so the market immediately saw a sharp decline. Until the afternoon opening, the current month fell by 0.065 yuan, and October fell to 0.0925 yuan, which was 0.03-0.04 yuan lower than the previous day's closing price. However, after this, the market sentiment gradually improved again. It was heard that Nandian Bang had always been bullish and gradually bought in, and some factories also came out to absorb and raise the price, so it rebounded by 0.01 yuan compared to the lowest price. The market is actually not prosperous, and the inventory on the market is abundant. If there is no effect, there should be a final short-selling situation. The current month fell by 0.0225 yuan compared to the previous day, October fell by 0.0175 yuan, November fell by 0.015 yuan, December fell by 0.0075 yuan, January fell by 0.002, and February fell by 0.0125 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e244">In the Hurricane <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Fang</p>
<p>Gloomy weather, howling wind, pattering rain, blowing and falling incessantly. Chaotic clouds billow overhead, the sun not showing a sliver of light. Signal lights flash on the rivers and seas, black signal balls hoisted. Turbulent waves churn in the Huangpu River, swallowing the wild cries of all sizes of steam whistles on the river; many ships quietly moor along the banks; the trees by the river sway madly as if about to fly away with the wind. The bustling Bund, with its normally shuttling ships and carriages, is now sparse and desolate, transformed into a world of biting winds and cold rain. People hurrying along the roads wear grim faces, as if burdened by immense worries; this is the eve of the approaching hurricane.</p>
<p>Indeed, people completely lose control in the face of the terrifying threat of nature! As you walk along the Huangpu River, turbulent waves incessantly crash against the shore, the strong wind, mixed with rustling rain, comes from all directions, enveloping you, making it impossible to move or breathe. What you see are dark clouds and waves, what you hear are the sounds of wind and rain; all external threats plunge your entire mood into an abyss of terror, like a small boat that has lost its oar and is forced to flee.</p>
<p>The hurricane intensifies, the echoes heard strike the walls as if preparing to destroy all buildings. People generally worry about the future horrors, looking up to the sky, asking when this gloom will clear. However, the technicians at the Observatory know, they can tell us how many miles this hurricane travels per hour, when it will leave us, without the slightest hesitation. Yes, the hurricane is bound to come, and when it comes, it will eventually pass.</p>
<p>However, while the natural hurricane causes disasters, its causes are simple, its duration is short, and it is still bearable. Only the political and economic hurricanes in historical evolution, although their direction of progress can be foreseen like meteorological events, and there are also methods of resolution and prevention, but the causes are more complex, and the duration is slightly longer, which is not tolerable for the average person. And its harm is more severe than that of a natural hurricane.</p>
<p>The youth of today are like people in a hurricane, under the shock of economic and political turmoil, and due to various reasons such as the inability to see the clearing of the gloom and impatience, some are swallowed up, some escape, some wander, and very few can deal with this hurricane with a calm attitude, like astronomers observing natural hurricanes, and use the results of this observation [to understand] its causes and trends, to seek solutions.</p>
<p>Here, we can say one sentence: There is no education in China today! Written on the night of the storm, September 2, 1933.</p>
<h3 id="e245">Hurricane <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Ping</p>
<p>The azure sky connects endlessly with the vast and fertile fields, a gentle breeze lightly blows, the willows hanging over the riverbank wave ripples across the still water. Cuckoos fly across the sky, calling "cuckoo every family," a joyful spirit filling the blue sky and air. The young masters and misses in the city lightly move their noble bodies, and also step into the economically bankrupt countryside, admiring the beauty of nature; however, Ah Xiang, who labors all year round but cannot support his family, at this time, is rolling up his trouser legs, holding a hoe,</p>
<p>[Text obscured, possibly referring to resistance against foreign powers]</p>
<p>loosening the clods of mud in the fields, like an ox; but his ox was sold to the village chief of the east village last year due to the cheap price of grain. He has no good fortune to enjoy this beautiful gift, he must work like an ox. Sowing, transplanting, dividing seedlings, from dawn to sunset. The beautiful blue sky flies away like an arrow in his toiling work. Then comes the summer with the blazing sun in the sky, but the green leaves on the wheat field provide shade, cicadas chirp noisily above, sitting underneath drinking and chatting is also quite pleasant, farmers do not have this blessing! Ah Xiang looks at the inch-long seedlings, wanting to grin; but the heavens have not rained, and every day he hauls water with a pump, the small river running through the east and west villages has become much shallower, and the hundreds of acres of fields in both villages are still absorbing as much as possible, if it doesn't rain for another ten days or half a month, a drought is imminent. Ah Xiang watches the inch-long seedlings, the smile on his lips fades away. A tragedy of selling the ox comes to mind, and two clear tears trickled down his face.</p>
<p>It was a winter morning last year, with snowflakes dancing in the air. His wife shivered in the thin blanket, with no clothes to wear, and no grain was seen in the jar. Ah Xiang was preparing to go to the east village to borrow some rice when a large sedan chair and the village chief came to his door, it was the landlord Master Lu who personally came to the countryside to urge the rent. The farmers in this village are all tenants of Master Lu. Although it was a bumper harvest last year, each dan of grain was only worth five yuan. When paying the rent to the granary, the account was not cleared, and it was agreed that it would be returned to Master Lu by the end of the year; this was the last hope of the villagers, that the few dans of grain could be sold at a good price as a savior. Seeing that the end of the year had arrived, the price of grain was getting cheaper. Ah Xiang's mother had died in the first half of the year, and the costs of the funeral and medical treatment were an immense burden for a poor farmer, so at this time, there was no grain left in his home. Seeing that Master Lu and the village chief had personally come to the countryside, knowing that there was no room for denial, he secretly sold the ox to pay the rent.</p>
<p>This summer, he could only rely on his own two legs to draw water. Fearing that the water in the small river would not be enough to irrigate the hundreds of acres of fields in the two villages, he worked day and night, his feet full of blisters, not daring to rest. Every night he observed the stars, never seeing any sign of rain. Naturally, the farmers in the east and west villages were all frowning. For more than half a year last year, some sold their possessions, some were swindled. If there was another drought this year, the people of the two villages would become refugees. However, it did rain, and the green seedlings were laden with ears of grain. Ah Xiang happily put down a heavy heart.</p>
<p>That night, he was awakened by a loud noise, a terrifying hurricane swept over the roof, the four walls of the house were shaken, and the roof creaked as if it was about to be blown away. Ah Xiang trembled in the torn blanket, not daring to poke his head out, it seemed that many houses nearby had collapsed, with loud cries and shouts. His whole heart was swirling with fear of sacrificing his only dwelling in the storm, his wife was terrified and crying. When the farming tools hanging on the wall fell, they made a loud noise. Whoosh, whoosh, a terrifying hurricane just swept over the roof, the worried couple did not sleep well all night.</p>
<p>But even more frightening things were to follow. The next day, many thatched huts had collapsed nearby. Ah Xiang thought of going to the east village to see his in-laws. Stepping out of the door, the boundless rice fields were lying prostrate in the fields. He felt like he had fallen into an abyss of darkness, his eyes staring at the abundant ears of grain he had reaped with great effort since spring and summer, lying prostrate like a sick man...</p>

<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Act II: The fleeing crowd</p>
<p>Young Master: There is no such thing, I am the most conscientious person. If you don't believe me, I won't marry a wife in this life to show you.</p>
<p>Auntie: Don't say that, I just don't like to hear these things. The two of us will never be able to stay together for life. Even if I hadn't married your father, you wouldn't be my ideal husband. What's the point? Let's just have fun while we're happy, why talk so far? What's the use of being able to talk but not do?</p>
<p>Young Master: You're starting with that same old routine again, why do you always spoil the mood? Don't you really love me?</p>
<p>Auntie: Why wouldn't I really love you? But I see through everything, let's just do as we go.</p>
<p>(A steam whistle awakens the dreams of this mother and son.)</p>
<p>Young Master: Oh no, the whistle is blowing again, they haven't come yet.</p>
<p>Auntie: I think they should be here now.</p>
<p>Orderly: Young Master! (Enters from the pantry, followed by the station master.) I have now invited the station master, please negotiate with him in person about that matter.</p>
<p>Station Master: Haven't all the family members arrived yet? We have been waiting for a long time. (Looks at his watch.) Originally, this train was supposed to leave at 10:20, but it's already 10:45.</p>
<p>Young Master: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, please sit down.</p>
<p>Station Master: You're welcome. What would you like to discuss, Young Master?</p>
<p>Young Master: It's just a small matter. I'm really sorry to have to ask the station master to come in person. The adjutant in our division said that this carriage was chartered by us, I don't know why there is a female member of another family sitting inside.</p>
<p>Station Master: Did she just arrive?</p>
<p>Young Master: (To the orderly) Did she just arrive?</p>
<p>Orderly: She's been here for a while.</p>
<p>Station Master: Oh! I remember. I originally wanted to come and discuss it with the Young Master in person, but because the refugees were causing trouble, I asked the ticket inspector to bring her. That is Mrs. Wang, the section chief of the provincial government; (in a low voice) she suddenly ran over and asked us for a seat, and I couldn't think of a solution for a while. The first-class seats are all reserved, and she won't sit in second class, and there are no empty seats. So I asked her to squeeze in with you. Because you don't have many family members, and the carriage is large. Please forgive me, Young Master. You know, the section chief's wife, now that she has come, I can't possibly not give her some face. Haha, right?</p>
<p>Young Master: But, Station Master! You have chartered this carriage to me, so you shouldn't... Haha, right?</p>
<p>Station Master: You're right, I shouldn't. But there's really no way, please forgive me, Young Master. ...! There's really nothing to do when you encounter this kind of thing. You see, the outside is full of refugees, all fleeing from the front lines. But there aren't enough trains, and most of them don't have money to buy tickets. They insist on taking the train, is that reasonable?</p>
<p>Young Master: Yes, yes.</p>
<p>Station Master: Everyone wants to take the train, but they don't buy tickets, is that right? If this continues, the government's railway income will disappear. ...</p>
<p>So I have to go and enlighten them now. ... I won't keep you company, Young Master, please sit.</p>
<p>Young Master: Please, please. But that... what should we do?</p>
<p>Auntie: I think we should just let her sit, everyone is just trying to save face.</p>
<p>Station Master: Yes! Really…</p>
<p>Young Master: Thank you, thank you! Thank you, Station Master, for your special help. (Walks out the door, then turns back.) Those people really don't understand reason. Crying and screaming, making a lot of noise, it's simply outrageous, it really makes me angry. It's really difficult to work for the country, I bear the burden and endure the blame! ...Okay, Young Master, goodbye. (Shakes hands and leaves).</p>
