<h3 id="c31">沉悶之局勢元 <a href="#c31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>中國今日之内憂外患。可謂危險已極。全國緘默觀望之狀態。亦可謂沉悶已極。當此國家民族將淪於危亡之時機。無論何種人。均宜有激昂奮發憤慨拚命之氣槪。以力爭生存。而顧乃有此沉悶之現象者。一則因政府當局。雖有抵抗而不妥洽之表示。然而事實上究竟如何决定方針。將如何開誠布公與民衆切實合作。以挽救此國難。又將如何策劃布置。與各方面團結一致。以共赴此國難。我人均如蒙在鼓中而一無所聞。一則因我人民中於苟且偷安之積習。惑於兵凶戰危之謬說。又見政府未有確實明白之主張。更無鼓勵勇氣之倡導。遂亦躊躇觀望而不前。因是二者。乃成今日沉悶之局勢。</p>
<p>然而此種沉悶局勢。不可久延也。沉悶久則種種懷疑生。猜忌生。因懷疑猜忌之結果。於是造謠以肆其挑撥離間者生。利用以從中坐收漁利者生。更因誤會而種種枝節意外之問題。亦由斯而生。黨政當局。疑人民之有所反對也。或不滿於某種政策而圖推翻也。或不滿於某種行動而圖抵制也。於是對於人民之一言一動。則防之惟恐不嚴。對於自已之一言一動。則秘之惟恐不密。如此能與人民接近乎。人民方面。則疑黨政當局之終不覺悟也。某種政策或將實行也。某種壓迫或將加甚也。向之慮政府不與人民合作者。今又慮人民不與政府合作矣。猜疑之結果。小之人民視政府如路人。大則人民視政府如仇敵。豈第不相接近而已。歷史上亡國滅種之禍。皆起於上下之猜疑。而成於國是不定掩飾沉悶之局勢。其可痛心。孰過於是。夫所謂國難者。國民與執國政者共負者也。今則國民與執國政者之間。先不能消除猜疑。固結一致。其將如何共赴國難耶。吾故謂此種沉悶之局勢。實國難危險期中之最危險者也。</p>
<p>然則將如何以打破此沉悶之局勢乎。時局沉悶之前提。旣在政府無剴切明確之表示。一方不以救國方針示我民衆。一方又不以共同禦侮之誠意。宣示我民衆。我民衆丁此國家將亡之危機。誰無心肝。誰不欲急謀自救。徒以不知政府眞意之所在。雖有熱心而無所依賴。雖欲竭力而無從集中。苟政府當局。一旦毅然决然倡率於上。則誰不願奮然興起。以共負此救國之責。國勢危殆至此。不可再稍諱飾推諉。一切敷衍延宕之手段不必用。憤激責備之談不必講。鈎心鬭角機智取巧之小策不必弄。惟有政府與人民。各去其互相猜疑之鬼胎。事事公開商榷。爲難之處。不必隠瞞。應改之事。毅然力改。能如此推誠相與。則政府果有困難。人民自當曲諒。人民果有善策。政府自當服從。團結一致。然後出其全力以共赴國難。則誰不樂於犧牲。誰不甘心拚命。此爲打破沉悶之第一要著。倘若長此沉悶下去。民衆日翹首企望。而政府之消息杳然。行動寂然。則將由懷疑而志氣銷沉。或由懷疑而轉爲怨憤。鬱極之後。或即繼以疾風猛雨。沉悶局勢之變化。將非吾人所能預測。而其危險又豈吾人所忍言哉。</p>

<p>華盛頓會議</p>
<h3 id="c66">羅斯福總統將宣布世界經濟復興計劃 <a href="#c66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>中法意德日等國均被邀參加</p>
<p>分别商榷不採圓桌會議形式</p>
<p>路透七日華盛頓電　英相接受美國請書後、美國已請法意德政府領袖親來美京討論世界經濟會議之籌備事宜、此項邀請、係由駐三國之美大使口頭傳達、如政府領袖不能前來、前政府其他要員亦所歡迎、否則由外交當局互換意見亦可、未來之國際談話、將分别辦理、而非如圓桌會議式也、聞羅斯福總統將傾其全力以期減除商業上與金融上障礙、大約以直接裁減進口稅率什一爲根據、但戰債問題將不爲討論中之重要事件、因此問題僅爲時局中之一原素耳、美國除邀請歐洲英法意德四强外、今日又表示準備與其他有關係國討論經濟大會事之意、以期預爲將來倫敦大會佈置一切、而節省開大會時許多星期之工作、</p>
<p>國民七日華盛頓電　頃聞美總統羅斯福與國務卿赫爾、業已會同準備一復興世界經濟計劃、將與各國特派代表分别討論、並聞美總統之意、此時不主張舉行圓桌會議、寗待世界經濟會議開幕後、再行共同討論、</p>
<p>中日兩國亦在被邀交換意見之列、國務卿務爾業於今日向中國公使施肇基口頭邀請、但料兩國當未必再另派專員來美商榷、此外各國尤其智利巴西阿根廷等國則將特派專門代表至美、並提供復興世界貿易之試行計劃、</p>
<p>美總統决定與各國代表分别商榷一舉、實與其主張與各國分别商訂相互貿易協定新政策相符合、惟聞美當局尚不圖在初次討論中即行商榷此項協定、此時主要目的僅在探聽各代表對於各該國與美貿易狀况之意見、蓋美總統欲將所有貿易障曁悉行掃除、故欲集思廣益、聆各方提議也、且聞美總統對於消除貿易障壁願令美國首先讓步、以爲各國唱、</p>
<p>再羅斯福赫爾兩人所擬計劃内雖未列入修改戰債問題、欲將其另行討論、但當會商經濟問題時、逆料此事亦不提及云、　　國民七日華盛頓電　各國駐美代表今日多已由本國政府授權與美總統商榷振興經濟計劃、蓋國務院已向各國口頭邀請也、</p>
<p>頃據可靠方面傳出、美當道將提出討論之計劃、並非完全美國計劃、一部份即以英大使林德賽備忘錄内所列事實與建議爲基礎、此備忘錄乃數星期前由林德賽與國務卿赫爾互相交換、以便研究世界經濟情形者、據稱、美總統計劃將考慮歐洲現在情形、並聞美國對於普減關稅及軍縮將有切實供獻、至美關稅統加减削之議、並不足以阻礙美國日後再與各國商訂相互恊定也、</p>
<p>今夜此間對於美總統將如何與各國代表分别會商一節、紛紛揣測、據稱、英相麥唐納將爲白宫上賓、首先商榷、此外各國代表逆料將先後啓程、未必同時來美、至法總理達拉第意相墨索里尼與德總理希特勒雖已見邀、據聞因不克抽身、將派第一等重要人物爲代表、</p>
<p>此時外間對於美總統計劃、雖有種種傳說、但無一徵實、又關於美政府將請國會授權准許短時期停付戰債之說、亦未能徵實云、</p>
<p>路透社七日羅馬電　頃悉意相墨索里尼原欲任駐美意大使羅梭爲意國代表、出席於討論經濟大會事之美京會議、以羅氏乃經濟專家也、但現因英相麥唐納已允親赴美京、而他國生要人物或亦將聯袂赴美、故擬改派位置較高之代表、傳說財政大臣約恩前已允應英相之召、前往倫敦與英相晤談者、兹或奉命赴美參加羅斯福總統所召集之會議、</p>
<p>路透八日柏林電　軍縮會議美代表台維斯今日抵此、即與外長牛賴特及興登堡總統討論經濟狀况及軍縮問題、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯八日柏林電　興登堡總統於正午十二時接見軍縮會議美國首席代表台維斯、希特勒總理則將於傍晚時與台維斯會晤、外長牛拉脫亦將列席、據台維斯左右宣稱、柏林之行、僅任探訪消息、蓋冶維斯欲乘間與德國政治領袖會談、藉以窺知經濟會議之成功、有賴於裁軍及修改和約問題、究至若何之程度也、</p>
<p>國民七日柏林電　美國駐歐洲代表台維斯明日將來柏林、與外長牛賴特晤談、並依預定計劃、德總統興登堡將親自延見台維斯、台氏將在柏林度星期日、此次台氏之來德京、係請德國派遣代表赴華盛頓參加世界經濟會議之初步討論、聞德國早已决定接受該項邀請、惟擬不遣派特别代表團、因德國所處之地位與英法微有不同、英法二國恐復將討論協約國間之債務事項也、故德國或僅將由新任駐美大使路得博士刘席云、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯八日巴黎電　外長彭古今晨電達里昻城前總理赫禮歐、謂據駐華盛頓大使電告、美國邀請法國派員參加談話云云、此事達拉第總理業已告知赫氏、星期二日上午赫氏回巴黎時、即可答復、</p>
<p>路透八日東京電　羅斯福總統邀本日參加華盛頓世界經濟會議談話之請書、已於今晨到達東京、現悉日政府將接受此請、</p>

<p>電通八日東京電　小山法相之留任决定問題、及於政局之影響、各方面極爲重視、政府方面以小山法相之辭任問題、爲閣内不安之一、現已解决、則齋藤首相所抱之内閣運命延長策、可以遂行無阻、但尚有一重大懸案、即高橋藏相之辭任問題、尚無頭緒、故内閣之不安、依然未去、齋藤首相於參拜大廟之歸途訪問園公後、雖極力慰留藏相、然至今日藏相尊重舊臘與鈴木總裁之厭契、辭意更堅、此次剌激於小山法相問題、日内必向齋藤首相提出正式辭表一面齋藤首相如藏相正式辭職萬無打銷之望時、擬更迭之、然改造内閣恐不能如首相之企圖、容易進行、况軍部大臣與政友系閣僚、旣已表明絶對反對更迭藏相、則藏相果辭、勢難由現内閣之手、收拾時局、預料此時齋藤内閣仍唯有出於總辭職之一途、</p>
<p>電通八日東京電　國民同盟對齋藤首相慰留小山法相、奏請降下優詔之舉、非常重視、本日發表如下之聲明書、彈劾齋藤首相、大意謂司法大臣决心辭職、齋藤首相認爲無此必要、奏請闕下降下優詔、乃一種廻避輔弼責任之不逞行爲、斷不能許、</p>
<p>電通八日東京電　鳩山文相昨午二時、訪鈴木政友會總裁於其私邸、報各關於小山法相提出辭呈之前後事情、同時關於鳩山文相本人之進退問題、有所懇談而去、次於午後九時再度往訪協議一切、均一致以屬於司法省所管之赤化問題、旣退還小山法相之辭呈、則關於文部省所管鳩山文相同樣之責任問題、當然亦受影響、故此時鳩山文相之單獨辭職、乃爲無用之舉、結果决定現内閣至五月始不得已總辭職、故政友會此時不採積極的行動、暫時自重靜觀政局之推移、</p>
<p>電通八日東京電　關於小山法相之辭職問題、政友會發表聲明書如下、司法大臣提出辭呈、乃爲當然之事、而齋藤首相於執奏之際、竟奏請退還、世有宣傳現内閣鞏固戀棧之决意者、以余等觀之、現内閣乃完畢其使命、而在退却之途徑、</p>
<p>電通八日東京電　小山法相之留任問題、即於閣内亦守沈默、廻避一切議論、而於表面上似已告一段落、惟政界之暗流、將乘機表面化、是頗堪注目者也、緣由法相之問題、齋藤内閣之總退却、反因此而提早、致政界方面已注意於後繼内閣之如何、至後繼内閣問題、已有種種之運動、若期待再降大命於齋藤首相之運動、以政友鈴木總裁爲目標之恢復憲政常道之運動、以平沼男爲主班之强力内閣運動等、至擁護齋藤首相者爲伊澤多喜男等之民政黨、伊澤氏知小山法相之留任問題、而竟旅行關西、出諸辛辣手段、似已早有計書云、</p>

<p>美國工運改良派的通訊機關FederatedPress最近關於美國近數年來經濟狀况、曾發表一簡單而扼要的統計、大意謂自一九二八年起直至現今、美國處於近代史上極端的經濟破産之中、許多大工業部門、實已終止存在、即幸而尚足以維持者、其生産額則跌落了百分之八九十、有的工業如鋼鐵業、在現今局面之下、再有一年即可達至零分、若現况再繼續兩三年、則美國全部工業、將要達至絶境、據其統計、四年之間、美國工資薪俸及零售商業周轉總額如下、</p>
<p>工資薪俸總額　零售商業總額</p>
<p>金元　金元</p>
<p>一九二九年丨五三○萬萬　五○○萬萬</p>
<p>一九三○年丨四五○萬萬　四四○萬萬</p>
<p>一九三一年丨三七○萬萬　三七○萬萬</p>
<p>一九三二年丨二八○萬萬　二八○萬萬</p>
<p>農民收入、跌落更甚、其情况如下</p>
<p>一九二九年丨一二○萬萬金元</p>
<p>一九三二年丨　五五萬萬金元</p>
<p>若不用貨幣、而以噸數來表示美國基本工業　額、其　　更　、比如上引四年之間、鋼鐵業産額數目爲四十丨三十丨二十丨十即是說再有一年即成爲零分了、其實際産額如下、</p>
<p>一九二九年丨三九·一○○·○○○噸</p>
<p>一九三○年丨二八·九○○·○○○噸</p>
<p>一九三一年丨一八·○○○·○○○噸</p>
<p>一九三二年丨　九·五○○·○○○噸</p>
<p>新屋營浩業之跌落如左、</p>
<p>一九二八年丨二八萬萬金元</p>
<p>一九二九年丨一四萬萬金元</p>
<p>一九三○年丨一一萬萬金元</p>
<p>一九三一年丨　八萬萬金元</p>
<p>一九三二年丨　三萬萬金元</p>
<p>若以所發營造執照數值計算、則四年之間每月平均數目如下、</p>
<p>一九二八年丨五五三百萬金元</p>
<p>一九二九年丨四八一百萬金元</p>
<p>一九三○年丨三七七百萬金元</p>
<p>一九三一年丨二五八百萬金元</p>
<p>一九三二年丨一一五百萬金元</p>
<p>若以一九三二年衰落情况測之、大約到一九三三年七月七日、房屋營造業、恐將全部停頓、到九月一七日、所有一切營造事業恐將全行停頓、伊里諾斯州（lllinois）實已達到這步天地、營造熱照之發給已跌了百分之九八、有些營造事業、如芝加哥新屋營造業、早已全行停頓、</p>
<p>許多鐵路公司、預料於一九三三年行將破産、此由鐵路凈收入數目將完全證實、其過去四年之　每月平均收入額如下、　　一九二九年丨一○六百萬元</p>
<p>一九三○年丨　七四百萬元</p>
<p>一九三一年丨　四四百萬元</p>
<p>一九三二年丨　二七百萬元</p>
<p>此種數目告訴說、若再繼續如斯跌落、則越年恐將達到盡地云云、又據LabourReserohAssoclation計算、一九三二年十一月份美國失業者數目曾爲一千六百七十七萬四千名、同時據工業界機關報實業週刊計算、爲一千五百二十萬名、即佔美國獨立營生者總數百分之四二、計各界失業人數如下、</p>
<p>農業丨丨丨丨丨一·二八三·○○○人</p>
<p>伐木漁獵業丨丨　　一三七·○○○人</p>
<p>礦業丨丨丨丨丨　　三九二·○○○人</p>
<p>營造業丨丨丨丨一·九四三·○○○人</p>
<p>其餘各門工業丨五·○○五·○○○人</p>
<p>鐵道運輸業丨丨　　六六七·○○○人</p>
<p>其他各種運輸（包括郵電）丨　　八四二·○○○人</p>
<p>商業丨丨丨丨丨一·一○○·○○○人</p>
<p>行政官吏丨丨丨　　一三三·○○○人</p>
<p>自由職業丨丨丨　　一○五·○○○人</p>
<p>僕役等丨丨丨丨一·五二七·○○○人</p>
<p>其餘各門事業丨三·六二○·○○○人</p>
<p>共計丨丨丨丨一六·七七四·○○○人</p>
<p>一九三二年十二月後、美國工業生産指數、更形跌落、企業之破産與倒閉、均大大增加、因此現在美國失業數目預料更在一千七百萬以以上云云、（三月八日）</p>

<p>顔大使由日内瓦抵莫斯科</p>
<p>蘇俄暫不加入顧問委員會</p>
<p>中蘇會議之回溯與其结果</p>
<p>莫斯科通信、我國駐蘇大使顔惠慶、於三月五日蒞俄、而鮑格莫洛夫（Bogomonojf（亦定於三月二十二日去華、是中俄復交後交換大使已實現、此後惟待訂立條約矣、</p>
<p>顔氏於國聯特會通過報告書之後、以爲時局重心、將由西方移至東方、復於三月一日下午、由日内瓦赴莫斯科、隨行者一等秘書魏良聲·三等秘書黄聞平、過柏林訪中蘇會議全權代表莫德惠、談以前交涉經過及此次交接手續、三月四日下午、經波蘭抵俄邊界、Ｎiegoroloje稅關、已預得其政府知照、行李完全免騐放行、</p>
<p>三月五日淸晨抵莫斯科、外交人民委員會派交際司長傅祿凌斯基Ｆlorinski來迓、顔氏以代表處屋宇湫隘、暫以Savoyy旅館爲行署、中蘇會議代表處專門委員王曾思、當夜代表莫德惠設宴、爲顔氏洗塵、鮑格莫洛夫亦在座、此爲二大使之第一次會面、席間縱談中俄交通商務諸問題、甚爲歡洽、鮑氏熟諳世界經濟大勢、蘇俄之妙選此人、說者謂亦鑒於以前在華政策之失敗、改弦更張、以後將側重推廣中俄貿易、似不無理由、</p>
<p>顔氏於三月九日呈遞國書、追述十三年前與帝俄斷交、今又與蘇俄復交、皆由一己躬親其事、爲可紀念之事實、中俄地壤相接、地理歷史上、以至政治上、關係密切不可分、而首與中國訂平等條約者、又蘇俄也、俄國政治上之改造、與夫新經濟政策之由理想而趨實現、成績昭然、已爲世人所共見、而其中最感興奮者、莫過於中國、因中國亦同在建設途中也、中央執行委員會委員長加里林答詞、謂蘇俄對華政策、已詳於一九一九·一九二零兩年之聲明、今後惟繼續此項精神、期與中國邦交日益親睦、顔大使介乎兩間使國交斷而復續、其功績至堪稱頌、加氏又與顔氏私人談及滿洲問題、謂此可促中華民族之自覺、但欲得圓滿之解决、將歸根於自己奮鬥、按蘇伯對於國聯之顧問委員會、已表示暫不參加、於三月七日由外交人民委員會委員長李特維洛夫、正式函復國聯秘書長德魯蒙、蘇俄本不信任國聯、亦不滿意於報告書中之建議且蘇俄尚有大宗利益在日人掌握中、故其行動不願受國聯束缚、兹將俄文原函附譯如下、</p>
<p>蘇聯政府、對於二月二十四·二十五·兩日貴秘書長來函之提議、已詳加討論、並深切研究所附帶之各種文件、結果認國聯决議與十九委員會報告、同以國聯盟約·九國公約·及凱洛格公約等爲其根據、蘇聯對於上述各約、祇曾簽字於凱洛格公約、至於前二項、則並未加入、蘇聯自其建國之日起、即曾宣布各民族有自决之權、可以自由表示、而不應有任何外力之壓迫容於其間、並堅决反對割地賠欵等武裝征服及暴力侵佔之結果、以此爲其政策之基本原則、根據此原則、自須對一切國家之領土不可侵權、及政治經濟與行政獨立權等絶對尊重、除和平方法外、不許以其他任何方法、解决國際衝突、至對於包含上述各原則之各種國際條約、自應負嚴重遵守之義務、</p>
<p>蘇聯政府提議一般的全部的裁軍、其目的即在使不承認此原則之國家、亦無法破壞此項原則、近來裁軍會議、蘇聯代表、曾提議對谥破壞國際和平條約及暴力侵佔行爲、常引爲自辯之種種口實、須適用制裁方法、凱洛格公約及其他類似之國際條約、僅包含上述原則及蘇聯提案之一部份、國聯解决中日衝突决議案之根據、旣與蘇聯和平政策之原則、有相近似之處、是其與蘇聯意見、頗多不謀而合、</p>
<p>然國聯大會所通過十九委員會報告内載對中日衝突建議、適用國聯决議、本部長認爲對於數種極嚴重之問題、實已離開上述之根據、而不能與之並立、依種精神、大會所議决成立之顧問委員會、即爲國聯之一機關、其目的之一、即係促進大會履行其義務、此機關並應向大會建議、蘇聯旣非國聯會員、對於大會之如何决定、即無從左右、</p>
<p>顧問委員會之目的、當在促進會員國及非會員國行動之一致、不過加入該委員會之二十二國家中、十三國與蘇聯並無任何正式關係、是過半數國家對於蘇聯、自多取敵視心理、蘇聯旣不能與過半數之代表、進行談判、又不能與利害相共之國家、單獨談判、則該委員會能否與蘇聯取一致行動、即生疑問、至此等國家、能否眞正顧及建議書所提出蘇聯之利益、尤令人懷疑、因上述情形、蘇聯政府認爲不能對於國聯議决案、表示同意、而於現時加入顧問委員會、</p>
<p>蘇聯政府、自中日發生衝突之始、即願竭其力之所能及、以防止武裝衝突之繼續開展、使不致演成世界大火之新源、並採取嚴守中立之途徑、本此精神、蘇聯政府忠誠實行其和平政策、對於任何國際團體、及單獨國家之政府、企圖迅速公正解决衝突、保障遠東和平之行爲與提議、將永遠採、致之行動、</p>
<p>中國駐俄大使本爲孫寶琦、但迄未履任、故駐外大使、實由顔氏開其先、而莫斯科除英德法義日波斯土耳其阿富汗外、又增一中國大使館矣、在蘇俄境内、房屋均歸國有、中國大使館之房屋、雖由該政府指定、並言明租費每年三萬盧布、惟屋内現有住户甚多、遷讓需時、修理亦需時、恐非二三月後不能正式成立也、</p>
<p>外交人民委員會副委員長加拉罕、於三月十三日在外交賓館宴請顔大使、及大使館全體人員、加氏爲蘇俄第一任駐華大使、今負對付滿洲問題之重責者也、顔氏亦於三月十五日爲鮑格莫洛夫及中蘇會議代表處專門委員王曾思餞行、同座有蘇俄大使館參贊鮑洛夫·（Barnoff）二等秘書波羅福·（Borovoy）駐滬副領使梅立可夫斯基·（Melnikovski）及外交人民委員會條約司長沙班林·（Sabanine）遠東司長谷樂夫斯基·（Kozlsovki）秘書長開立沙福夫（Krisonfoff）等、新由中國來此之大使館參事吳南如·二等秘書薛鏞·隨員劉錫章亦參與焉、</p>
<p>大使館成立、代表處即結束、溯自伯力協定簽字、何啻城下之盟、中國雖有二八宣言、而蘇俄置若罔聞也、大錯鑄成、危機一髮、莫德惠奉命倉卒就道、於民國十九年五月九日抵莫斯科、惟因權限問題、忽生波折、中方只令莫討論中東路問題、而俄方則堅持須兼及復交與通商、經長時間筆舌之爭、乃將權限擴大、於是中蘇會議、遂於十月十一日正式開幕、俄方首問中國承認伯力紀錄否、中方則旨在﹁含混答復力圖避免、﹂討論三小時、無結果而散、加拉罕謂下次開會、仍須討論此問題、會議至此、不遂成僵局乎、幸由張學良顧維鈞就藩陽向俄領疏通、竟得俄方諒解、暫時不提、於是會議又於十二月四日再開、分中東路·復交·通商·三委員會、從事技術上之研究、但討論大綱時、中方暗中仍保全二八宣言堅持非先解决前者、則不談後二者、此爲俄方所不能允、莫氏無可進行、乃於十二月二十一日回國請訓、先北平而後南京、結果三者允同時討論、民國二十年三月二十八日、莫氏再到莫斯科、會議亦於四月十二日再開、孰知中東路問題、因共管與贖路二者互相爭持不能决、九一八以後、俄方更無意談判、而莫氏因感觸舊疾復發、即於民國二十一年三月十九日赴柏林療養、莫斯科方面、由專門委員王曾思代行其職權、以至於今、現外交部令將印信送京繳銷、文卷及傢具、則移交大使館、王氏以手續淸楚、已於三月十五日與中東路督辦公署秘書長蔡運辰、取道海參崴歸國、至莫氏夙有暈船之症、不便海行、將俟其夫人病愈後、有五月取道新疆歸國說、予之追叙此事、備將來訂約借鏡云爾、（三月十六日中央社）</p>

<p>十二、滿洲資源</p>
<p>就滿洲國的資源來說、事實上就很偉大、在十年内的經營可以變成像美國那樣富裕的國家、誠然在内地方面、因有匪賊跳梁的危險、無從進行調查、又一方面因爲政者須繳納租稅及其他關係、不確實報告資源之實在情形、普通的人到滿洲旅行、祗在火車窗外之一瞥、或在旅館的應接室聽見滿洲無業者的話而悲觀的人也有、但是如果請問了諳於實情的當事者、就可以明白滿洲是很豐富的、或許可以變成美國以上的富國也未可知、</p>
<p>要之、軍需資源方面和食糧方面都不發生問題、今年正閙着的鋁的問題、這原料滿洲也有許多朝鮮也有、這種工業目前在滿洲·國内都正在開辦着、所以一兩年後必有相當的出産、現在又在兵庫縣的夏梅地方發現了鋁的鑛石、發現的人呌做平安、已經决定在該處製鍊、以後錩製雜貨也會出産的、並且代用品也相當能應時合用、現在從外國輸入的金屬類如錳等、倘如開發了滿洲就可以從該處採取的、發生困難的就是石油問題、其次的問題就是橡皮、倘如橡皮完全無法輸入、那就稍覺困難、然而也可以利用代用品、的、如地德國在五年内完全没有橡皮、然而也能繼續着戰事、</p>
<p>十三、發明是經濟戰之勝利品學者時常做發見或發明的事業、近代的戰爭都用武力、經濟、思想、外交、内治、培養等的種種形態表現着、所以在經濟戰方面要發見油的代用物、換言之、油的代用物可以說是經濟戰的勝利品、我們大可以提倡經濟戰勝利品的發明、</p>
<p>關於發明的研究也非大在的努力不可、非用國民的全力向國家所規定的目標研究發明不可的、要努力於發明在國内已經能自足的更精巧的東西、不如努力於發明國内所得不到的東西較有意義、關於這一層目下政府正在進行着、最近的將來必定有可觀的成績發現的、</p>
<p>從總動員的計畫來看、人的要素竟變成一種極重大的問題、單就工業方面來說、對於職工或技術員能分配得法統制適當就不成問題的、但是同一工業中、在戰時也有自然趨於衰微的工業、反之一時極盡膨脹的工業也有、而把衰微的工業和膨脹的工業、兩者的職員或職工彼此通融是勢所不能的、例如把大部分從事於纎維工業的人移用於重工業方面是不可能的、或許一部分能移用也未可知、然而像這樣的、對於人員的總動員計畫是很困難的、這種現象如戰事一開始、必然會發生的、結果必定會生出多數的失業者、把這些人業者如何處置、亦非大大的考慮不可的、又熟練工的問題也是極難解决問題、熟練工之存在與否能左右該工業的效率、尤其是對於戰時非極膨脹不可的重要工業、應該從平時把熟練工養成起來的、</p>
<p>美國對於工廠設備很新奇的進行着、對於産業動員的事似乎研究得很起勁、並且於實施方面也相當進行着的樣子、例如把美國的本國土地分成十四個的兵器管區、於每一區各置有力的實業家一名、稱曰管區長、政府依賴此人來和製造業者取聯絡、這個管區長平時向某工廠定做軍需品的一部分、並且在一管區内辦理工業動員的計畫事宜、這個計畫、第一必須舉行調查、其次辦理定做物件的計畫、做生産的計畫和原料材料的計畫、並且也要研究橡皮和錳的代用品、其他關於計畫的統一、動力的統制、運輸的計畫、勞働等事宜都須對各工廠作考慮和調查、這些就是管區長的任務、日本的陸軍因爲從來的預算很少、所以陸軍的兵器都在造兵廠製造、在民間製造的、飛機之外、不過是機關槍等的若干物而已、然而自滿洲事件發生以來、因軍需品預算的增加、所以最近在民間製造的有很多、在去年第六十二次議會、陸軍因時局救濟的預算而獲得千八百五十萬圓、其中除去建築費等的純粹軍需品預算爲千三百萬圓、這預算如何動用、先舉出一例來說、直接由造兵廠、兵器本廠、航空本部的陸軍官廳所規定的民間工廠有兩百個、在這二百工廠之下每工廠平均各有十個工廠帮同製造、所以在千三百萬圓之下工作的工廠數共有兩千、而在其中工作的職工約有三百萬人、自事變發生以來、熟練職工、除特别事故者外、失業者一個都没有、現在在小倉所看見的情形、就是自一月前就要募集三十名的旗盤工、但是應募者一個都没有、這就是没有失業者表示、所有以前從事於軍需工業工作、而現在失業的人都完全被救濟而復職、全國失業者雖然很不少、但是這些决不是軍需工廠的失業者、而是從來没有就過職的人、如是現在的日本大大的利用着民間工廠、這在說明美國的情况之後、應該附帶的說一說的、（完）</p>

<p>前校長蔡元培訓詞略謂、本人於二十年前負笈於此、五年前曾一長此校、今值三十七周紀大會、又能躬奉斯盛、從歷史上回溯前塵、大有今昔之感、但此三十七年中交大之形式、雖有變更、而其精神則始終一貫、故其一切步驟、未嘗有絲毫之錯誤、確能將中國之需要、從根本上做起、從前中國人之吸收西方文明、祇從需要上着想、戰勝不勝人、則從事於改良器械、結果發現西人除戰爭利器外尚有法律政治、於是乃從而習法政、又發現法政之能良善、全賴敎、</p>
<p>育、於是又從事敎育、誠所謂﹁頭痛醫頭、　痛醫脚、﹂祗從請要上做去、不在根本上着想、此穏方式純係錯悮交大初立時、係仗盛公宣懷之力、當時僅爲政治之訓練塲所、後悉欲求斯學昌明、非有良好中小學根底不可、於是又先後分設中小學校、厥後知敎育爲法政之根本、又改師範班、民國以來、曾一度隸屬農商部、又改爲商業學堂、不久卽隸交通部、乃以交通爲專門學科、以交通技術爲其敎科中心、交大之根底於是確立、現在滬校有工程當理科學三院、北平有鐵道管理學院、唐山有工程學院、學制甚爲整齊、目下敎部規定凡得稱大學者、須有三學院以上、交大之添設科學院蓋卽本此、國人作事、往往注意應用、不根據原理、科學實爲各種應用科學之基礎、欲發達應用科學、必須注意純粹科學、交大之突飛猛進、合乎時代需要、殊屬欣佩云、</p>

<p>民國二十一年</p>
<p>民國二十一年，遭民國以來未曾見之國難，無異積弱之身，忽染時疫，百病齊發。政治則舉國皇皇，幾無一日之安定；社會則農村衰落，幾至全國人民，淪於失業；經濟則舊式商業組織奄奄待斃，幾次第崩潰；金融則資金集中都市，内地血脈，完全停滯。此種情形，，在交通發達，經濟組織完密，及人民生活程度高騰之國家，種種恐慌騷擾之現象、必早已層見迭出，甚或不免於内亂；然在中國則交通幼稚，信用組織未臻靈敏；産業組織未臻完密；生活程度尚未提高，故雖不免遭受上述之困難，猶能倖免於國民經濟之破裂，抑以渴者易爲飲，飢者易爲食，憑藉金融上之小小助力，一切産業與建設，反易於建樹歟！本行有見於此，故决定仍採取有進無退之方針，對於金融界鞏固及改進金融組織之合作運動，固已盡力援助，以促其成；即凡工業因缺乏資金，不能進展者，則充分接濟之；凡農産品因無金融帮助，不能維持相當價格者，則盡量調劑之；凡各省建設事業，需要鉅大資金者，亦無不盡力助共完成；一面盡量向内地放欵，矯正集中現金於都市之弊病。蓋認淸信用産業幼稚之國家，旣能倖免於金融與産業之恐慌，即知金融上之繼續援助，實可以間接促進社會與秩序之安定。證諸已往一年頀之成績，私幸所取方針，尚無錯誤。以有二十年歷史之金融機關，能於國難最嚴重之時期中，對於國家社會，稍盡厥職，吾股東與吾同仁當亦同聲慶幸者也。已往一年間，在國家社會上，頗有一二差强人意者。除四川二劉之戰，全國尚無重大内戰，實以軍人鑑於國難，覺悟内戰之非；同時各省均知從事建築公路，不可謂非軍人心理之移轉；二十一年度財政部未再發行公債，一掃二十年來政府借債度日之積習，不可謂非財政當局整頓收入平衡預算之成功之第一步；政府與社會漸知提倡改良農村之重要，國民愛用國貨之趨勢，日見熱烈。此皆由國難剌激中所得之敎訓，使國民心理有一重大之變換。深冀因此變換之結果，吾金融界向所遭遇之困難，得以消除；而改良社會經濟之種種工作，得因社會之諒解與合作，益使進行順利。所謂多難興邦，此尤私心所深切期望者也。</p>
<p>中國銀行民國二十一年度之營業</p>
<p>本年度開始，承二十年度水災及東北事變之後，全國市面，未及蘇息，即有一二八事變；年中膠東發生戰事；歲末復有川中内閧；共匪未靖，農村衰落，可稱終歲竟無寗日。本行搘拄其間，經過之困難，爲從來所未有。卒賴全行平日所蓄實力，與同仁刻苦奮鬥，幸能保持常態，此堪爲股東告者一。東北各分支行，數年來抱定專心營業，不問其他之方針，故雖經大變，仍保持商業自由之固有地位，未受絲毫損失。渝行及成都支行，立於敵對雙方勢力範圍之内，逼借勒索，在所不免，當地同人，苦心應付，非有抵押，非各行共同分擔，不允借墊，幸無特殊單獨損失，此堪爲股東告者二。至於滬戰期中，金融重心，阽危已極，幸各方處以鎭靜，卒得轉危爲安，本行業務，一如常軌，此則萬衆一心，自覺自助，實國民進步之象徵。使事變發生於前十年，竊恐雖有砥柱，難禦狂流，自非本行所敢引以自侈。至若本年度金融界之資金，益見剩餘；優良之投資途徑，益趨狹隘，利率開支，負擔不能輕減，此爲大勢所趨，而莫可如何者也。</p>
<p>一　資産負債</p>
<p>存欵</p>
<p>（甲）存欵總額　二十一年度各項存欵，總餘額爲四七六、五四八、○五三·四三，較二十年度計增加一三、八九一、六八六·四五。分析言之：則（一）活期存欵·餘額爲一八三、六○一、○五七·五九·較二十年度減少五九、九五九、一二六·四六。（二）定期存欵，餘額爲二三四、六三二、○四七·五九，較二十年度增加六○、三八九、三八三·九八。（三）同業存欵，餘額爲五八、三一四、九四八·二五·較二十年度增加一三、四六一、四二八·九三。</p>
<p>（乙）存户數目　二十一年度存户數目，較之十九，二十兩年，幾爲級數的增加，兹比較如下：</p>
<p>十九年度存户總數　　　七六、一二七户</p>
<p>二十年度存户總數　　　九三、○四六户　　較十九年增一六、九一九户　　二十一年度存户總數　一一四、四九三户　　較二十年增二一、四四七户　　（丙）存欵性質　二十一年度各項存欵，依照存户之性質，與二十年度比較，其百分率如左：</p>
<p>性　　　質　　　二十年度　　二十一年度　　增减百分率</p>
<p>機關存欵　　　　八·二五　　　四·四六　　減三·七九</p>
<p>工商業存欵　　三三·二九　　三三·八六　　增○·五七</p>
<p>團體及個人存欵　　五八·四六　　六一·六八　　增三·二二</p>
<p>基於上列本行存欵存户數，及存欵性質比率，可以知（一）市塲資金運用之途益蹙，爭覓基礎安全之銀行，定期存儲。（二）工商業及團體個人存欵之增加，足以顯示社會對於本行之信賴，與年俱增。</p>
<p>放欵</p>
<p>（甲）放欵總額　二十一年各項放欵：（一）活期放欵及透支餘額爲九九、四一七、三四七·九三，較二十年度減少一一、二七九、一○三·五一。（二）定期放欵餘額爲一八九、四三七、○六八·二○，較二十年度增加一、二○一、五四六·四四。（三）貼現及買進期票（包括進口押匯及出口押匯）額餘爲三四、○三六、八○一·六九，較二十年度減少九六九、八三四·七三。</p>
<p>綜以上三項，共爲三二二、八九一、二一七·八二，以與二十年度各項放欵總數一八三、八五四、二○八·六六比較，數量似覺銳减，實則存放同業一項，本係存出現金。二十年度以前，係計入放欵數内，本年度將存放同業數目，改列貸借對照表現金之下。若將存放同業與其他放欵併計，則減少無多。</p>
<p>（乙）放欵性質　二十一年度放欵，依其借户性質類别，與二十年度比較百分率　　如下：</p>
<p>年　度　商業　　工業　　　公用事業　　同業　　團體　　機關　　個人二十年二一·七九一○·一四一·○八一五·○二一·三七四七·一九三·四一廿一年二二·三八一一·四六一·一九一八·九二○·六○四二·六一二·八四何業百分率。圖　二十　　比較，故仍將存放同業數目計入。若祇以活期放欵及透支科目内之同業爲限，則僅佔百分之四·二。</p>
<p>照上述情形，可知雖在本年度不良環境之下，放欵數目，並未過見减少；而增加工商業放欵，以輔助生産之方針，仍繼續不變。至定期放欵略增之故，由於定期存欵驟增，不得不覓較長之定期放欵以資平衡。</p>
<p>（匯欵）二十一年度全年匯欵總額，計爲七五二·二一五·三○七·七二，較之二十年度减少七千四百六十萬元，約低减百分之九；但較之十九年度仍超過一萬七千六百六十萬元。</p>
<p>近年本行因業務之策進，分設機關，巳達一百四十五處；即未設機關之地點，亦設法通匯；尤注意於内地小農工業市鎭，以期流通資金，輔助生産；一方對於匯解手續之敏速，匯水計算之平抑，更時時考求比較，是以最近兩年經匯數目，突飛猛進，由每年平均五萬萬元，增至七萬五千萬元以上。至於本年度數額，所以較二十年度略减者，約不外以下之原因：</p>
<p>（一）國内資金運轉緩滯。</p>
<p>（二）東北匯欵之減少，佔極大數量。因本年度多數勞工，巳紛紛遷回關内。　　（三）東北關稅郵政之封鎖。</p>
<p>兹按照本年度匯欵總額，除大阪分行及國外部收匯一·四五○·○○○元不計外，就全國區域，分析其收匯數量及比率如次：</p>
<p>區　　域　　二十一年度匯出總數　　　　百分率</p>
<p>長江流域　　　　三七一·八六四·○○○元　　　　四九·五</p>
<p>華　　北　　　　一六五·六九三·○○○元　　　　二二·一</p>
<p>東　三省　　　　一二三·九○七·○○○元　　　　一六·五</p>
<p>華　　南　　　　　八九·三○○·○○○元　　　　一一·九</p>
<p>再就以上匯欵數目，約舉其匯往地點及數量比率如次；</p>
<p>地　　名　　　　二十一年度匯入總數　　　　　百分率</p>
<p>上　　海　　　　三五五·五四六·○○○元　　　　四七·四</p>
<p>天　　津　　　　　五八·七七七·○○○元　　　　　七·八</p>
<p>其他各地　　　　三三六·四四二·○○○元　　　　四四·八</p>
<p>觀於上表所列，可知内地資金，集中都市；而上海一隅匯入之數，幾佔本行匯欵全額之半數，尤爲極堪注目之現象也。</p>
<p>（國外匯兌）本行自十七年受政府特許辦理國外匯兌，除相繼設立國外部倫敦經理處大阪分行外，原有各分支行亦分别派定人員積極辦理外國匯兌業務。祇以我國工商業尚未發達，進出口貿易不振；尤以出口爲其；且本行經辦國外匯兌歷史尚短，致外匯事業難與他國之外匯銀行相比擬。但本行以繼續奮勉力求進步之結果，亦尚有可述者，兹綜計本年一年中國外部及各分支行所辦外匯各項業務，列其大數如左：</p>
<p>開出進口商業信用證　　　六二、二八七、○○○元</p>
<p>進出口押匯　　　　　　　四三、三五八、○○○元</p>
<p>開出匯票及信匯　　　　　三三、六三七、○○○元</p>
<p>購入外埠期票　　　　　　二一、九二七、○○○元</p>
<p>代收欵項　　　　　　　　二一、六六九、○○○元</p>
<p>上列係由各種貨幣按照行市折成銀元，於此略可覘其大致，除仍繼續努力以求無負使命外，並深望（一）我華商從事進出口貿易者信賴本行，我國國際貿易能勝現有困難，進於繁盛，（二）政府繼續獎進工商業增加出口貿易，使本行得盡其職，則本行國外匯兌業務，當更可進展也。</p>
<p>（發行兌換劵）二十一年度年終，本行兌換劵流通額，爲一八四、四二六、九三六·五一，較之二十年度年終流通額，計减少七、三二二、二○二，八三。本行近數年發行流通平均數，常在一萬七八千萬元左右。實以本行認爲市面通貨，已有過剩趨向，不應再事膨脹；並以中央銀行漸見鞏固，深望遞嬗推移，漸爲發行之重心。故本行對於發行，不取積極推進方針，祗令維持相當固有數目，以應信用本行鈔票者之切要而已。</p>
<p>（有價證劵）本行有價證劵，按年底實行市計算，僅佔全體資産百分之八，其總額爲六四、五四四、四四六·二一，較二十年度之七二、○二四、四九七·八八，計减少七、四八○、○五一·六七，均爲收進還本付息之數。至金銀兩種證劵之百分率列左：</p>
<p>二十一年度　　　　二十年度</p>
<p>銀幣證劵　　　　　　五六·一　　　　五五·三</p>
<p>金幣證劵　　　　　　四三·九　　　　四四·七</p>
<p>共　　計　　　　　一○○·○　　　一○○·○</p>
<p>二損益</p>
<p>（甲）各項開支　二十一年度各項開支，爲六百零六萬六千餘元，比二十年度僅增二萬八千餘元。查二十一年度本行業務數量，未見减少。因時局之關係，運送郵電及捐欵等費用，均有增加；而開支總數，幾能維持原狀者，實乃一年來本行力求内部縮之結果。</p>
<p>（乙）盈餘分配　二十一年度純益一、八四七、九四九·六二，除照章提十分之一，即一八四、七九四·九六爲公積金，餘一、六六三、一五四·六六。此數加上年滾存七一、四八○·九九，减去攤派官商股七厘正息一、七二九、八一九·○○，下餘四、八一六·六五，仍列盈餘滾存項下。</p>
<p>業務工作</p>
<p>（甲）國内工業之維護扶助國内工業之進展，爲本行素來之業務方針。去歲春間，滬變事起，市面緊縮，停戰之後，又遭物價跌落，國内工業基礎薄弱，大都感覺週轉爲難。本行爲維護工業計，凡其事業爲社會所需要而其根本基礎並無瑕疵者，無不勉力接濟，以資運轉，二十一年度對於國内工業放欵，計三千八百四十三萬五千四百二十三元，較之去年增加七百二十二萬七千七百六十九元，即百分之二十三，此數所得之效力，堪稱十百倍於平日。上海方面增百分之四，外埠增百分之十九。其放欵總額中，各種工業，所占成分如左：</p>
<p>（一）紗廠　　　　六一·九　　（二）粉麵廠　　　一一·九</p>
<p>（三）絲廠綢廠　　　五·五　　（四）蛋廠　　　　　四·九</p>
<p>（五）飲食業廠　　　四·○　　（六）化學工業　　　二·六</p>
<p>（七）烟廠　　　　　一·五　　（八）建築材料廠　　一·一</p>
<p>（九）手工業　　　　一·○　　（十）火柴廠　　　　○·七</p>
<p>（十一）衣着業廠　　○·五　　（十二）布廠　　　　○·五</p>
<p>（十三）染織廠　　　○·四　　（十四）鐵工廠　　　○·三</p>
<p>（十五）橡膠廠　　　○·二　　（十六）紙廠　　　　○·二</p>
<p>（十七）其他　　　　二·八</p>
<p>（乙）國貨推銷之援助資助工廠，固足以促進生産；然人民國貨觀念尚在幼稚，外貨傾銷，異常劇烈之日，若不輔助工廠，提倡愛用國貨思想，增進推銷途徑，則國貨工業，難免不中途挫折。本行有鑒於此，於國貨運動之高潮中，聯絡滬上國貨工廠，百貨商店，組織﹁中華國貨産銷協會﹂，一面研究生産改良，成本減輕；一面努力出品推銷，價格公平。務令生産者合乎社會需要之標準；消費者隨解購買國貨之便利。並求普遍效能，廣大官傳起見，在産銷合作協會之下，附設國貨介紹所，設總所於上海，設分所於本行所在各地，希冀藉銀行精神上及實質上之援助，喚起社會各界之努力；并盼他日稍有基礎，此類機關，可完全獨立，仍歸實業界自行主辦。目下草創伊始，正有賴於各地有志之援助也。</p>
<p>（丙）蠶絲事業之救濟本年絲市彫落，陳絲及陳繭可製成之絲，積壓至三萬五千餘擔。除絲廠原有資金折蝕不計外，按照市價與押欵數目相比，仍須虧短規元一千二百萬兩，各地銀錢業之絲繭押欵，完全擱滯。若不設法救濟，不僅輸出貿易斷絶堪虞；而新繭上市，無人購買，農民生計，突受影響。本行隨絲業同人之後，奔走呼籲，幸由財政實業兩部曁江浙兩省政府熱心維護，頒布救濟絲業辦法，發行庫券三百萬元補助出口陳絲。經此救濟，絲廠稍見轉機，陸續開工；繭商亦下鄉設行，收買新繭，得以安定一時。直至年底，經一年之竭力推銷，陳絲出口，得逾二萬擔。本行絲繭放欵，雖不敢放手多做；惟於新繭上市時，曾聯合當地有力團體做出繭欵約二百萬元。至於絲廠放欵，不因有一二廠之呆擱而中止，仍擇其實心改良者，予以維持。深望江浙兩省當局有進一步之蠶絲業改進計畫，庶幾本行對於蠶絲業放欵，得有進一步之助力。</p>
<p>（丁）農村經濟之調劑民國二十一年，承上年水災之後，江浙兩省大熟，以社會無力囤積，遂致一時市上農産過剩，米榖呈空前之低價，農村經濟衰敗，險象環生。本行雖非農業銀行，然仍本其服務社會之宗旨，與江蘇農民銀行合作，在常熟，蘇州，無錫，常州等處，聯絡各當地銀行，酌量放做農民米榖押欵，以資調劑。浙江方面，在長興，吳興等縣，亦有放欵。是項業務，其用意在於使一般農民得以過剩米榖，存入倉庫，作爲抵押，借用欵項，維持生活。待至榖價稍回，銷路活動之時，再行贖回出售，庶不致因低價之影響，而有破産之虞。固知救濟農村經濟之澈底辦法，要非短時期一二銀行所能爲力，此不過治標之一策，稍圖目前之救濟而已。至根本救濟，有待於政府及各省當局之通盤規畫，本行無不竭盡能力以輔助之。</p>
<p>（戊）杭江鐵路之完成金融界自以前各鐵路投資成績不良以後，對於鐵路放欵，均裹足不前。長此交通事業不能進步，内地物産，益難流通，更足以促進農村之衰落。適浙省當局擬建築杭江鐵路，先造杭州至蘭谿一段，借欵三百六十萬元，本行即首先担任二百七十萬元。本年擬延長至江山，需續借欵二百五十萬元，本行再担任一百九十萬元。預定二十三年正初全路完成。本行不惜冒險投此鉅資，所冀政府當局，變更對於鐵路之觀念，認爲一種國家社會事業，不認爲收入之源泉；同時希望社會各界與吾同業共同奮起，抱不能再任政府蹂躪鐵路投資之决心，以挽救經濟衰落之危機。</p>
<p>（已）服務華僑之進步年來世界不景氣，海外僑胞經濟狀况，因之愈感困難，失業者日增，歸國者日衆，南洋匯欵，漸見减少，美洲方面，因美金價高，匯欵不減。本行閩粤兩分行，對於華僑服務，力求週密，南洋方面華僑匯欵，計二○·九三四·七○○元，歐美方面計三·○六五·○○○元，其他方面，亦有二○·○○○元；總計華僑方面，經本行匯欵總數爲二四·○一九·七○○元。</p>
<p>（庚）海外經理處之成績倫敦經理處，成立三載，賠貼開支之數，逐年减少，本年已稍見盈餘。大阪經理處，雖成立之後，即遇中日事變，幸辦理得宜，本年度亦稍見盈餘。</p>
<p>（辛）調查工作之增進調查事業，有賴於長時期之訓練及培養。本行近來致力於國内外經濟狀態之普遍的調查。出版物有：（一）中行月刊（二）金融統計月報；（三）中國内外債彚編；（四）最近中國對外貿易統計圖解等。所載資料，恒爲國内外研究經濟者所採用。本年度更進而著手於信用調查，對於一切法人及個人之信用資産狀態，加以善意的綿密之研究。除本行全體一百四十餘分支行共同努力，以期聲息相通外，並發起組織中國徵信所，以爲各華商銀行之聯合調查機關。成立以來，頗爲社會所信賴，業務日見發達。同時本行之顧客及國内外同業，因業務關係，直接向本行有所諮詢者，日亦十餘起，本行無不盡心調查答覆。旣使當事者知所取捨；亦可增進對方之聲譽地位。於促成確實之交易，增進商業之繁榮，蓋與有微力焉。</p>
<p>國難與國民經濟</p>
<p>九一八事變，予我民族發展及國家形成上以最大之創痕；而使此事件之範園愈益擴大者，厥爲上海一二八事件；使此事件之性質，愈益永久而深刻者，厥爲所謂﹁滿洲國﹂之成立。</p>
<p>（滿洲問題）本年三月一日，日本以强力製造一所謂﹁滿洲新國﹂，使與中國分離。中國因此失去八萬三百五十日方里之土地（大於日本本島百分之三十五）全中國十三分之一之人民，全中國四分之一之對外貿易，實爲開國以來所未有之奇變。不特東亞和平，從此破裂；即即世界安寗，亦日在威脅之中。其於政治上影響之大，固爲世界所公認；而於國民經濟上關係之重，尤待有系統的說明。一、貿易上之損失全中國各口岸中，滿洲各口夙爲出超口岸，其輸出國外之數，前年爲二萬八千八百六十萬七千海關兩，占中國全出口之三分之一；去年爲三萬二千六百零七萬五千兩，幾占其他各口岸出口總額二分之一强。由滿洲輸入中國本部之貨，前年爲九千七百八十六萬四千兩；去年爲一萬四千七百七十八萬一千兩，向之納於國内貿易者，今則視爲進口貿易。以本年度計，僅大連一口岸，輸至國外有輸至我國本部各口岸兩項併計，中國對外貿蝗損失已達二萬四千八百零二萬二千海關兩；而中國本部輸入滿洲之貨，前年爲八千九百八十四萬四千兩，去年減至六千六百二十九萬六千兩，減少二千三百五十四萬八千兩。即以大連一口而論，本年度由中國本部之輸入額又減一百餘萬兩，三項合計，損失二萬五千萬兩。中國之國際收入，年以十萬萬兩計，今大連一口，已去其四分之一矣。</p>
<p>二、資源上之損失滿洲爲我國重要之農林鑛區，農産品以大豆·高梁·小米，玉蜀黍，小麥五大宗計，全年産額約爲一萬四千七百萬石·（約合二千萬公噸）其中大豆一宗，佔全世界産額百分之六十六而强。柞蠶年産約二萬六千擔。林産品之蓄積量約爲六十一萬六千二百萬石·每年供給量約爲三百三十萬石至五百四十萬石之間，均供建築及造紙原料之用。畜産如牛，馬·騾·驢·羊，豕六宗，約一千五百餘萬頭，年産羊毛約百萬斤，其他毛類約三百萬斤，皮革合一切禦寒用之毛皮等，年産約二千四百萬枚，其出口額佔全國之半。水産品年産約四百萬元。鹽年産約八萬二千萬斤，數年後合候補鹽田之所産，可達十五萬萬斤，將爲滿洲重要産業之一。鑛産中以煤鐵爲最主要，鐵之埋藏量，鞍山一鑛，約三萬萬噸，全境約十七萬萬噸，年産額約二十萬噸，鑛質雖不佳，然在國防上　有重大之意義，煤炭之埋藏量約爲三十萬萬噸，每年産額約一千萬噸。撫順鑛之含油岩層約五十萬萬噸，以含油百分之六計，可煉油三萬萬噸。此滿洲資源數量之大較也。證以本年出口之數值：</p>
<p>農産品約三萬萬兩　　鑛産品約六千萬兩</p>
<p>畜産品約八百萬兩　　林産品約六百萬兩</p>
<p>水産品約七百萬兩</p>
<p>合計　三萬八千一百萬兩</p>
<p>由上列數目，可以知滿洲資源之豐富。擁此無盡藏之原料，不特能於工業上可以伸張無限之勢力；而國家經濟上可以達到自足自給之境界，此日本之所得，非即中國之所失耶！</p>
<p>三，中國移民根據地之損失晚近六七年來，山東河北兩省人民，或因地方不靖，或因租稅苛繁，或因年歲荒歉，生活艱難，每年移居滿洲之數，多則百萬人；少亦五六十萬人。查人口密度，山東省每一方哩占五百五十人河北省每一方哩占五百十二人；而東三省每一方哩祇佔六十一人，故有充分移民之餘地。去年以前六年間，兩省移居滿洲人數，約四百七八十萬人；離滿之人數，約二百萬人；即永久移住之人數，在二百餘萬人。今後日本人爲保護日本移民起見，已主張限制中國移民故中國失去廣大之人民移殖地，而此過剩之人口，將使中國社會上爲之不安。</p>
<p>四，金融上之損失自三省官銀行號合併，成立所謂﹁滿洲中央銀行﹂後，所有三省金融上之匯兌往來，均歸正金，朝鮮兩銀行總攬；即滿洲全部之對外資金，向歸中國之銀錢行號出入者，今皆移入日本銀行之手。向來東帮存在上海或天津之商業資金輒數千萬，此後將大見减少。於中國全部金融資金之損失，不在小數。同時中交兩銀行之發行，已定限期收回；而朝鮮銀行金劵發行數，自去年底之九千萬圓，增至一萬萬圓；正金銀行之銀券，自去年底之五百萬元，增至一千四百萬元。</p>
<p>五，中國工業上之損失近幾年中國輕工業漸見發達，滿洲漸成爲中國輕工業之消納市塲，其大宗爲棉織品，棉纱，麵粉，香烟，紙類五項。去年由中國本部輸入滿洲每種之比例數如下：</p>
<p>貨名本部輸入滿洲總額之百分比滿洲總輸入額之百分比</p>
<p>棉織物　　二六　　　　　四九</p>
<p>棉　纱　　一三　　　　　八六</p>
<p>麵　粉　　一五　　　　　四六</p>
<p>香　烟　　　七　　　　　五二</p>
<p>紙　類　　　四　　　　　三六</p>
<p>本年度已大見减少。棉織品自前年度之一千一百六十萬兩，减至八百三十萬兩；棉紗自二千萬兩，減至四百九十萬兩；麵粉自一千八百萬兩，減至八百五十萬兩；此後自見逐步爲日貨所排斥；爲關稅所驅逐。而最受影響者爲上海；次則爲靑島，天津。</p>
<p>六，財政上之損失據財政部報告：自東北海關被日人刦據後，去年海關收入，計減少一千五百萬海關兩。六月以後，即付公債之欵，亦不匯出。鹽稅自去年上半年被刧據後，計減少二千三百五十二萬九千四百三十四海關兩。照以上種種言之：滿洲區域，對於中國本部，其經濟的意義之重大，固豈法之阿爾薩斯羅倫兩州，所可同日而語，彼法人處心積慮四十餘年以爭之，吾人將如何乎。</p>
<p>（上海事件）上海一二八事件，本與九一八事件無直接關係，而南方之激烈抵制日貨，實爲中國國民對於九一八事變之自動的報復手段。日本昧於因果之所伏，乃欲以武力壓迫南方此種運動，致釀成淞滬之戰。以我人烟繁盛之市塲，供彼飛機重砲之試騐，損失數目，各方推測不一，有謂二十萬萬元有謂十五萬萬元，大致直接損失，至少十萬萬元；間接損失，亦不亞於此數。</p>
<p>一，閘北與附近太，嘉，寳三縣之直接損失近年來上海以租界地價飛漲，故住户與工廠在閘北之建築，日見繁盛。此次幾全部毁壞，已在社會局登記者，近九萬萬元，内工廠毁壞八百九十六家，金額五千三百餘萬元。鐵道與公用事業，損害三千餘萬元；學校二百餘所，損失一千餘萬元。至太，嘉，寳三縣調查之直接損失，共一千五百餘萬元。又太，嘉，寳三縣耕種田畝約二百萬畝，每畝因荒棄農事損失以五元計，共損失一千萬元。故謂直接損失，决不在十萬萬元之下。</p>
<p>二，全上海之間接損失因戰禍而商店停市，百貨滯銷，物價低落，證券與地産跌價，稅收驟減，此中損失，無法可以數目表現。以楊樹浦及北四川路，即東北二區之地價言之；北區地産，依照工部局一九三○年土地估值表，共有地二·二五一·三三二畝·估值八五·二二九·五一三兩；但滬變前市價，平均較估值高一倍半，即規銀一二七·八四四·二六九兩。滬變之後，一均地價跌落百分之廿五，即損失三一·九六一·○○○兩。東區計地九·八八○·九二二畝，估值一一七·二三一·七三三兩。滬變前市價，超過估值照一倍半計，即規銀一七五·八四二·五九九兩。亦照跌落百分之廿五計，其損失銀四三·九六○·六○兩。兩項合計，已在一萬萬元以上。以内國公債言之；因國難而加以整理，向來每年償還本息二萬萬元今減爲一萬萬元，即持票人年減一萬萬元之運用與生利。以上二端，其顯著者，此外商店及金融機關，航業公司等，因市面停滯之損失，更不可以數量計。故敢謂間接損失之數，亦决不亞於十萬萬元之直接損失也。</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>三·促成内地信用制度之破壞　　　　百年來，民間固有之年底淸賬之習慣，因一二八事變，完全打破，農民因戰事而不能淸結鄉鎭商店之　　　　　店　不能淸結城市商店之賬，因　城市商店對於内地錢莊之欠欵，不能淸還；即内地錢莊對於各大都市錢莊之欠欵，無法淸還。其結果則鄉鎭不見信於城市，城市不見信於都市，而上海錢莊對於内地各大城市之放欵，幾乎消滅，内地之金融血脈，完全阻滯。一年度江浙内地錢莊商號之倒閉者，不知數千百家，皆由於此。</p>
<p>四，促進物價之低落與農村之衰落本年度農産品之落價，幾將一半。此與外國農産品因生産過剩而跌價者逈不相同。蓋旣以交通不便，稅制不良，阻礙其流通，而致地方的分配不均；復因金融停滯，無和囤積，農民因需欵應用，不得不貶價求售，略不能得時間的調劑之效。良以物價之上落，繫乎消費之增減；同時繫乎投機之盛衰，其無囤積之原因，不外由於信用制度破壞，無法調度囤積資金。故上海事變，實爲促進物價低落與農村衰落之一重大原因。</p>
<p>要之，滿洲問題對於中國之國家經濟，予以重大之打擊與威脅；上海事件對於中國之社會經濟，予以莫大之破壞與損害；而本年度之一切經濟問題，直接間接，均受其影響，故不得不先論及之。</p>
<p>農村衰落與社會經濟</p>
<p>本年度有一重大問題，其影響不亞於國難，即所謂農村之衰落是也。農村衰落原因一三：</p>
<p>一、水患共患匪患所及之地，尚未復種，田畝荒蕪。</p>
<p>一、中等年歲以上收穫之地，因農産品低落，入不敷出。</p>
<p>一、育蠶區域，因收繭年成大歉，繭價跌落，農民副業收入大減。</p>
<p>前年度之洪水，受災田畝，達二萬五千五百萬畝，今年尚有大部份未能恢復耕種。至江西三分之二尚在共匪區域之内；鄂西皖北，共匪亦未肅淸，鄉民無法還鄉；此外因零星土匪騷擾，鄉民不能安居鄉里，棄地遷徙者，不知凡幾。因此不特田畝荒蕪，收穫減少；而在此區域内，農民失業，農村破壞，此其衰落之原因一。</p>
<p>其在可以耕種之地，則情形雖不如是，而結果則又正同。因農産豐收，物價低落，實呈古語﹁榖賤傷農﹂之現象，此爲本年度一新頴之變態。如廠機白米自六月間之每石十六七元跌至九元餘，相差三分之一以上，較之前年每石十八元，相差幾其一半。而農民成本，若以每三口之家，耕種租田十畝計之：　　支　　　出　　　收　　入　　（按上等年成）</p>
<p>豆餅肥料每畝一張半每張四元半四十五元每畝收三石糙米即二石四斗白米每石九元二百十六元</p>
<p>稻種每畝二元　　　二十元　小熟每畝收小麥一石每石十元一百元</p>
<p>水車工每畝約二元半　二十五元　共三百十六元</p>
<p>植秧拔草工每畝四元　　四十元　不足十四元</p>
<p>租金每畝八斗白米約合七元一角七十二元</p>
<p>小熟肥料假定每畝二元二十元</p>
<p>食用每人以一角計三口計每日三角一百零八元</p>
<p>共三百三十元</p>
<p>以上數字，不過舉其約數而言，容未盡符於事實，然亦不遠於事實。照此計算，農民終歲手足胼胝，猶得不償失，遑論事畜嫁娶，撑持門户乎丨此其衰落之原因二。</p>
<p>育蠶爲江，浙，廣東農民之主要産業；次之四川，山東，亦不在少數。本年度以江浙兩省論，祗産春乾繭五萬五千擔，每擔九十元，總值四百元九十五萬元。其産量則較之去年之十五六萬擔，減少三分之二。其總值則較之去年之二千二百五十萬元，減少一千七百餘萬元，即十分之七。秋繭前年約值八百萬元，本年祗及其半。故兩共減少二千萬元。即以鮮繭每擔成本論：</p>
<p>支　　　出　　　收</p>
<p>蠶種　　　　　　　　五元　　　鮮繭　　三十</p>
<p>桑葉每擔二元　　　三十元　　　　　　共三十</p>
<p>雜料如草木炭等　　　五元　　　　　　不敷十</p>
<p>共四十元</p>
<p>本年度江浙兩省内地市面之衰敗，金融之枯竭，由於蠶業之歉收，繭價之低落，此其衰落之原因三。</p>
<p>農村衰落所表顯之結果其最顯著者爲内地現金之流出，農民或以田畝荒蕪，或以農産落價，致收入減少，而其日用必需，未能盡捐，仍須求之於市。鄉間富户，或以匪患徙城市；或以農産衰敗，不再投資田畝，鄉間儲蓄，遂逐漸向城市推移。結果農付對於市鎭，市鎭對於都市，都市對於通商大口，均立於入超地位，現金紛紛流出。以上海一埠論：本年由各地流入上海之現金，平均每月六百萬元。往年四月，爲内地需用現金最繁忙之時期；乃本年竟流入上海二千二百萬元，實爲向所未有之事。全年輸入上海之銀元，計八千九百餘萬元；而輸出各地之數，除大連外，不過二千萬元。上海一地，銀兩庫存達一萬四千六百七十餘萬兩，較二十年底，增加一倍以上；銀元庫存達二萬二千四百九十二萬元，較二十年底增加五千餘萬元。</p>
<p>照上述種種趨勢，農民僅有之資金，已傾囊殆盡。今旣衣食不能自給，安有餘力以改良生産？若購買力日見衰退，安有餘力以事敎養？生産不能改良，即生産力無從恢復；購買力不能增進，即人民生活無從改善，工商業無由發展，將與全世界不景氣之現象，如同一轍。故於社會經濟，已成爲一極嚴重之問題·國人殊未可忽視之也。</p>
<p>二十一年度之對外貿易</p>
<p>一進出口總額猛跌我國二十一年對外貿易，較二十年進出口均大爲減退，揆厥原由，不外三端；向處於出超地位之東北各埠全部淪陷，各該埠對外貿易數字，僅二十一年之上半年有之，下半年數字，則泯滅於無形，此其一。受世界的不景氣風潮之震盪，我國對外貿易，愈形不振，此其二。中國關稅，實行增加，進口自受其妨礙，偷運之風，因以益厲，此其三。有此種種原因，故我國進出口貿易，均一落千丈；而尤以出口爲甚。考本年度對外貿易統計，進口爲十萬四千九百二十四萬六千六百六十一海關兩，較之去年之十四萬三千三百四十八萬九千一百九十四海關兩，減少三萬八千四百二十四萬三千五百三十三海關兩。出口本　度爲四萬九千二百六十四萬一千四百二十一海關兩，較之去年之九萬零九百四十七萬五千五百二十五海關兩，減少四萬一千六百八十三萬四千一百零四海關　。　　　　　出爲五萬五千六百六十萬零五千二百四十海關兩，較去年增加三千二百五十五萬餘海關兩。如以百分數表示，則進口比去年減少百分之二六，八；出口減少百分之四五·八·幾及二十年之半；進出口總計，減少百分之三四·二；而入超則反增加百分之六；二。進出口猛跌之巨，我國對外貿易史上·歷所未有也。</p>
<p>二進口品别米居首位進口國别美居第一就商品别而言：進口以洋米爲第一，爲值自二十年度之六千四百萬海關兩，增至一萬一千九百萬海關兩；棉花爲第二，爲值一萬一千八百萬海關兩；棉貨爲第三，約值七千二百萬海關兩；煤油爲第四，約值六千一百萬海關兩；金屬及礦砂爲第五，約值六千萬海關兩；再其次爲小麥，糖，糧食粉及紙等。出口以豆類爲第一，約值五千一百萬海關兩；生絲爲第二，約值三千三百萬海關兩；蛋類爲第三，約值二千八百萬海關兩；豆餅類爲第四，約值二千六百萬海關兩；茶爲第五，約值二千五百萬海關兩；再其次爲棉花，花生，棉紗及皮貨等。</p>
<p>本年度及去年度進口農産品一項，仍占最鉅數目，以價值計，本年度爲三萬四千八百五十九萬一千九百四十一海關兩，去年度爲四萬零八百十六萬一千五百海關兩；兹列表於後：</p>

<p>三出口品别豆類居首位出口國别日居第一我國出口貿易衰落之程度較進口貿易爲嚴重，以東北淪陷，爲其主因。東三省特産品如豆類，豆餅，及豆油等，因本年下半年即不列入海闕報告册之中。他如中國本部之生絲，桐油，茶，蛋類等，本年貿易，均異常不振。生絲本爲我國出口之主要商品，其數額僅次於豆類，顧年來因海外絲市驟跌，本國生産低減，本年出口額，僅及去年百分之三八·九，慘落之甚，無以復加。桐油因美國銷路減少，出口數字，亦連年縮減，本年僅及去年百分之七二·八。茶葉出口，因外茶競爭日烈，華茶生産，不見改進，故本年較去年又減低百分之二五·五。蛋類亦因各國增徵關稅之故，大受打擊，較本年低降百分之二四·八。兹將二十一年度出口商品價額，與二十年度出口比較，以見本年貿易衰落之一斑。</p>
<p>本年度出口商品，仍以豆類爲第一，值五千一百二十二萬四千九百二十九海關兩，二十年度則爲一萬三千八百二十二萬七千五百八十三海關兩；生絲爲第二，值三千二百九十三萬二千二百五十海關兩，二十年度則爲八千四百六十八萬零四百八十二海關兩；蛋類由去年度之第四位升至第三，值二千八百四十萬八千九百十五海關兩，二十年度則爲三千七百七十五萬七千五百三十七海關兩；豆餅由二十度年度之六千零二十四萬四千六百六十海關兩，跌至二千五百七十五萬四千八百六十九海關兩，占第四位；其餘如糧食，茶，棉花等，則依次下之。</p>
<p>以本年度出口國别論之：則仍日蜛第一，佔出口貿易總額百分之二三·二；美居第二，佔百分之一二，二；英居第三，佔百分之七·六；德意志由二十年度之第八位升至第四位；俄國由去年之第四位降至第五位：法蘭西仍位第六；而荷蘭由第五位降至第九位。兹列表如後：</p>

<p>五中日貿易之激减日本向爲與我國貿易最巨之國家，進出口貿易，自前淸宣統二年（一九一○）以來，每年均居首位，但自九一八事件發生，招致吾國各</p>
<p>地抵貨運動後，對華進口貿易之首位，遂爲美國取得，本年年初，又因進取錦州及一二八事件，中日間糾紛愈甚，貿易所受打擊非淺。二月間日貨輸入最巨之商埠，如上海等處，貿易幾致全部停頓，雖日貨因日本金禁關係，得以低廉之匯價，在華競爭推銷，（按前年日金對海關兩之平均匯價爲○·六九元，去年竟跌至一·二三元）。然卒以國人愛國熱忱，當此中日問題未解决前，貿易終尠發展機會；入冬以來，抵貨運動漸歸沉靜，但華南與華中一帶之貿易，仍無恢復希望。總計去年日本對華進口貿易减退百分之四八·九，出口貿易减退百分之五六·八。兹將日本輸往我國重要商品價值表列下，以見去年减退之程度：</p>

<p>六吾國每年入超之鉅額金銀輸出超過輸入，大半依賴華僑匯欵以資抵補。但年來吾國經濟不振，華僑匯欵減少，金銀移動方面，遂不得不受其影響，連年金銀輸入量之減少，是其明證。本年且一變而爲金銀輸出超過輸入四千五百萬海關兩。考二十一年度生銀純進口額，爲二千四百二十八萬九千九百六十二海關兩，二十年度爲四千五百四十四萬五千零十六海關兩；本年度生金純出口額，爲七千零十一萬四千五百十海關兩，去年度爲三千二百十萬九千七百九十一海關兩。即二十年度我國純輸入現金銀一千三百三十三萬五千二百二十五海</p>
<p>關兩；而二十一年我國反純輸出四千五百八十二萬四千五百四十八海關兩。七銀價問題與中國國際貿易，國際匯兌有關係之銀價問題，國際間仍不忘其爲國際濟問題之一；近且列入行將開幕之世界經濟會議議事日程中。查去年銀價，較之往年，更日趨衰落。是年紐約平均價每一盎司﹂爲二七分八九二，較之去年之二八分七○一，平均低降一分而弱。而是年十二月二十九日，竟曾跌至二四分二八，開自有銀史之低價新紀錄。今後銀價之能否提高，仍繫乎全體物價之能否向上；同時又繫乎用金國家之願否再擴充生銀之貨幣用途。若論銀價與中國之經濟關係，則不妨一述其利害互見之點，聊供討論銀價者之參考而已。</p>
<p>（一）中國財政中國所舉之外債，外關稅爲擔保者，進口稅均以關金計算，可不致因銀價跌落而增重財政上之負擔。然銀價跌則外貨昻，關稅增，成本加重，人民之購買力減退，輸入商品必減，關稅收入，亦當隨之減少。至外債之以鹽稅及鐵路收入爲擔保者，因其收入均以銀兩計算，銀價跌落，則外債負擔，自當加重，直接雖爲政府之負擔，間接則爲人民之負擔也。</p>
<p>（二）中國對外貿易對外貿易中最重要者，厥爲匯兌率之穏固，不宜過於高低。因匯兌行市劇變，商人輒遭旡妄之損失。外商每乘銀價最低時，向中國商人定貨；而中國出口商人，爲便於銷售起見，恒以低價向内地收貨，俟銀價低落時，以賤價求售於國外市塲。故銀價低落，足以鼓勵中國之出口貨；而同時可以減少進口貨，於中國不爲無益。</p>
<p>（二）中國國内工業銀價低落，進口稅增加，舶來品當然昻貴，若乘此機會，推銷國貨，似易爲力；中國工業，將無形進化；而國内市塲，亦將有相當發展。故銀價低落，爲振興中國工業之絶好機會。</p>
<p>（四）生活程度國内之製造品，不免受銀價低落之影響，而提其價格。蓋各種原料機件，悉仰給於外洋，如國家之重要企業鐵路等等，自不得不重行釐訂價目，以彌補支付外債，採購車輛及材料之闕。在重要城市或商業中樞，生活程度之提高，較之農村區域尤爲明顯。至内地人民，生活程度較低，需用舶來品較少，甚或舍而不用，故損失較小。</p>
<p>（五）經濟改造與經淸發展若欲期中國經濟之改造與發展，則機器機件，决不可少，勢必仰之海外，故如敷設鐵道，改良交通及建設新工業等計劃，必以受銀價低落之陳碍而進行迂緩。</p>
<p>（六）結論綜上述情形觀之：銀價之高漲，對於中國利害互見。非謂提高銀價足以增加中國積蓄銀貨之價值，即爲有利於中國。設國際經濟會議中，能研究方案，俾銀價得以比較安定，非若今日之忽上忽落，則有裨於中國者已非淺鮮矣。</p>
<p>八國際貸借差額之前途二十年度本行報告書中，已將中國今後將無法以抵補入超之差額及購買力之必然減退，警告國民；按之本年度事實，進口額之銳減，金銀之出超，不特表示人民購買力之低落，且證明人民罄其儲藏之金銀，以易生活必需之品。生金出口之報關數目，雖在五千餘萬兩，實則私運之數，必有過之。本年度之抵補入超，或賴有此。同時無形出口貿易之華僑匯欵，雖南洋各地市面蕭條，多數華僑或則失業回國，或以無業經營携資回鄉，然尚能維持相當數目。美洲，菲利濱，檀香山等處，一因美金漲價，一因無業經營，亦當有鉅數匯回。本年華僑匯欵數目，計南洋方面一萬一千七百萬元，美屬方面一萬八千六百萬元，其他各地二千四百萬，共計三萬二千餘萬元。此數較之本行去年報告之數似有增加。惟本年調查手續較爲精密，而是否正確，仍不敢自信；且美屬匯欵頗占鉅數，是否包含華僑採辦商貨之欵，不能懸斷，但總數仍在二萬萬元以上，當可斷言。顧不可不注意者，本年匯欵大半消耗積蓄，非平日來自收益者所可同日而語。今後美國市面設再衰敗，匯數必更減少，即中國所存生金亦將搜括殆盡。試問每年五六萬萬元之入超，將從何抵補，即不限制洋貨進口，亦恐人民之購買力趨於自然低降，貿易自然衰退。若洋米，洋棉，洋麥仍如本年度之鉅數進口，滿洲出口貿易之損失，不思有以補救，更恐生銀銀元亦將一反數十年之有進無出之常軌，而變爲出口。國際貸借，關係國民全盤生計之根本，於目前中國之政治經濟上，可謂已成最急切之問題。朝野國人，當知國家社會之亂，皆由國民經濟之崩潰而來，史乘斑斑，可不深長思乎。</p>
<p>二十一年度之農産</p>
<p>本年度長江流域一帶，農産豐登；但北方因春冬兩季旱災，收成略小；東三省則因北部洪水爲患，收穫亦減。兹將最近二年中國本部農産量百分比列左：</p>

<p>（米）吾國産米區域，在淮漢以南；而最重要産區爲蘇·浙·湘·贛·皖·桂等省。是歲雨水調和，收成豐美。據主計處統計局調查·蘇·浙等八省本年度産米五七二·九七七·一○○　。</p>
<p>（麥）長江以北，黄河以南，爲吾國産麥主要地。是歲北方數省，如陜，甘及河南一部分，因上冬降雪過多，加以春間黑霜成災，致收成不佳；即中部南部各省，亦有因雨水過多，麥株損傷。據金陵大學農學經濟系調查，本年度蘇·魯·晋·冀·等四省，計産一七五·八二○·○○○擔。</p>
<p>（棉花）吾國産棉區域，最重要者，當以長江與錢塘江口岸一帶，及冀·魯·豫等省。去夏雨量較多，收成本難有望，幸氣候急轉調順，經日光曝曬，棉枝發育甚佳。據中華棉業統計會報告，本年度全國棉産額爲八·一○五·六三七擔，較二十年度增收一百六十三萬餘擔。</p>
<p>（茶）茶爲我國南部各省大宗出品。年來因匪氛不靖，收成頓減。據最近調查，是歲全國産額，僅約四百五十萬擔，出口量僅六十五萬三千擔，價值共二千四百七十六萬一千海關兩；二十年度茶葉出口爲七十萬○八千擔，價值三千三百零五萬九千海關兩。</p>
<p>（烟葉）據報告所得，本年度吾國烟葉産額，比去年稍减。山東所産之烟草爲五千萬磅，去年則爲五千五百萬磅；河南約二千五百萬磅，去年爲三千五百萬磅；安徽産量之估計，則爲五百萬磅，去年爲二百五十萬磅。每畝之産量，比去年爲大；但在河南及山東植烟草之畝數，則比去年减少。在出産烟草兩重要區域所收穫之烟草，其質地比一年前較劣。市面所有外國之烟草，本年年終比歲首爲少；但烟葉这輸入，只等於去歲之一半。</p>
<p>（植物油）本年度豆油及桐油産額大减。豆油出口額較去年度减三分这二，計四十六萬三千七百五十一擔，值四百八十萬三千四百十五海關兩；桐油輸出計八十萬二千七百六十九擔，合一千四百八十六萬六千海關兩；上年度出口額爲八十萬九千擔，值一千八百八十八萬海關兩。</p>
<p>（農業問題）今日中國之農産問題，在如何减少外國農産品之進口而求生産之自給。其最重要者，爲米，棉·麥三項。本年度米産額爲八萬七千三百萬擔，進口洋米爲二千二百四十八萬擔，按照中國需要量，果分配平均，勉可自足；湖南安徽兩省，本年均見供過乎求，如果他省能利用此過剩之米，則進口即可减少一萬萬餘兩。棉花之中國需要數，紗廠方面至多需一千萬擔，衣被手紡需一百五十萬擔，共一千一百五十萬擔，本年度國内棉産估計八百零九萬擔，是生産與消費比較不足三百四十萬擔。十八年·十九年·二十年三年洋棉進口之平均數爲三百五二四萬擔，本年度進口爲三百七十萬擔。去年中國粉廠需要麥數爲七千萬包，每包爲一百五下斤或一擔半，共一萬零五百萬擔。而去年進口之麥，計共一千五百零八萬多擔，未可漠視也。外國農産物進口之原因，不外：一·中國之生産不足，二·分配不均，三·價格昻貴，四·品質參差不齊，五·貨物可到達之時期不準。生産不足與品質不齊，非由政府與人民合力改良品種與勵生産不爲功。分配不均，只須政府能與各省當局有一精密之計劃，完善之組織，不難奏效。至於貨到時期之正確與否，繫乎鐵路運輸之改善，及内地沿途軍隊之切實保護，不加留難。價格問題，則關乎外國貨之市價，近來外國物價日益低落，如蘭貢米最小價每擔七元半，西買一號米每擔最小九元二角，與中國米價，相差無幾。棉花美棉每包合三十四兩，與陜西標準棉每包三十二兩半相差祇一兩半。澳參每擔合四兩二錢，中國麥每擔四兩零五分，價旣不相上下，而品質優良劃一，貨到時期正確，廠家焉得不歡迎外貨！假使廠家偏用外貨，價格又復壓低，農民必以出産滯銷，成本不敷，逐漸减種，其結果農産益見低减。因是國人頗多外國農産品增加進口稅之主張，不得謂無理由。惟於增加進口稅之前，須將國内産銷之分配平均，及内地運輸之切實改善二者，辦有成效，然後知全國不足之其實數量，及農民之確實成本，而加稅之是否必要</p>

<p>，及加稅之輕重標準，自不難迎刃而解矣。</p>
<p>二十一年度之工業</p>
<p>本年度因抵制日貨，提倡國貨，及銀價不高，各種工業尚有相當成績。然以市面不振，物價低落，故産量曾未大減，而營業總額已漸見低減，盈利更見微弱，非上年可比。兹將各業情形，略述於左。</p>
<p>一紡織業據最近調查，全國共有紗廠一百二十八家，開工紗錠四百四十九萬三千三百餘枚，比較二十年底，增加二十六萬五千一百三十餘枚。其中屬於華商紗廠者，計二百五十二萬二千三百餘枚，比較二十年底，增加十四萬一千七百七十五枚。屬於在華日商者，計共一百七十八萬七千七百八十餘枚，比較二十年底，增加十萬零九千三百八十餘枚。全國中外紗廠出品，最近一年中，共計棉紗二百二十八萬三千八百九十八包。其中華商紗廠出品，僅約一百四十二萬七千九百二十包，日商紗廠出品，則有八十萬零五千九百七十九包。去年度各紗廠産量，比較前年爲增，棉紗銷路，則見減少。上海紗號全年營業大都虧本，七十一家紗號之中，倒閉者共十七家。華商紗廠之被日軍砲火轟毁者一家，局部被害者七家，其他各廠，因紗銷減少，無不大受影響。至廠布産量，，計商紗廠本年度之出品，爲二十萬零六千餘件，在華日商紗廠所産棉布，合二十五萬五千件。自東三省市場完全爲日人佔領後，我國本廠布及士布，受極大之影響，統計上海一埠，現有棉商號六百三四十家，較諸往年減少三分之一。本埠棉布商之經營外貨，無不折閱，惟推銷國貨棉布之家，稍有利潤。至於小布廠，則因日貨跌價競爭，及出品滯銷關係，僅能苟延殘喘而巳。</p>
<p>二棉織業中國之棉織業，亦以上海爲中心。統計本埠棉織業五十四條家之中被日軍砲火所毁者十六家，較大之廠，均在戰區以外，故未波及。棉織廠之中，專事織造汗衫及衛生衣者共八家，全年營業三百八十餘萬元，較上年度減少七十餘萬元。本年度以物價跌落，故斯業中接受大量定貨者，無不虧折。</p>
<p>三繅絲業本年度中國生絲産業之衰落特基，上年度我國生絲出口總數，共計十三萬三千餘擔而本年度總數，祗有七萬六千六百餘擔。且合美國銷路者，日見其少，去年美國購進生絲五十四萬七千九百包，其中日貨佔五十一萬三千包，而華絲僅一萬八千包而已。運往印度者，則增加一倍有半，運往歐洲者，亦與上年數量相彷，惟價格低落，絲廠無不虧本。本年度絲廠開工者，無錫四十七廠中祗開九家，上海九十七廠中祗開十一家，而絲業衰落之最大原因，仍在蠶種退化，養育無方，非有根本救濟，絲業難望進步。</p>
<p>四絲織業綢緞爲我國特産之一，近來國際經濟衰落，對於我國綢緞進口關稅增加；而在南洋，安南，印度則近年受日貨排擠，東北市塲又被日本侵奪，故生産額隨銷路而大减。上海絲織廠五百六七十家，繼續開工者，祇二百四五十家。本年度之營業，較上年减少百分之三十强。杭州綢廠，自九百餘家减至二百餘家；南京蘇州各綢廠，更無起色。</p>
<p>五其他各業麵粉業則本年上半年萎靡不振，下半年日漸暢旺，故斯業頗爲發達。捲烟業全年統計，全國出品約計一百四十餘萬箱，共值一萬六千八百餘萬元，較上年减少百分之十。滬上各廠，大都無利可圖。其較大者如南洋，英美，華成各公司均有相當得潤。橡膠廠在本年度大見增加，香港，靑島，均設新廠，上海方面，增加二十餘家；但生産增加而銷路不旺，致成供過於求之現象。結果去年橡膠廠營業，多數有虧無盈。機器工業，近年頗見發達，國内工廠所用之各種輕工業機器，均能仿製，成本較舶來品減少三分之二。上海一埠，現有機器工廠大小五六百家，其中加入公會而認爲規模稍大者，計一百零七家，全年營業總數，約計一千一百餘萬元，較上年度减少三分之一，化裝品統計上海化裝品工廠七十餘家，上年度營業總數，超過八百萬元，本年則不足五百萬。油漆業上海方面較大者祇四家，本年全體營業，約計二百九十萬元，較上年度增加十分之一。搪瓷廠營業，共計三百五十餘萬元，較上年度减少百分之三十六。熱水瓶廠在滬戰期内大受損失，然恢復甚速，本年全體營業總數，與上年相仿，約計二百七八十萬元。</p>
<p>國貨工業基礎之薄弱，已屢言之，今後中國人民購買力日見低落，其影響於工貨工業，固不待言；而日貨挾其巨大之勢力及低價之匯兌，向中國傾銷，更屬無可抵禦。惟有集中同業力量，免除競爭，减輕成本；而政府對於國貨工業，必須有有計畫之維護·對於勞資合作，必須有善意之指導；而國民對於國貨之愛用更必須認爲國民應盡之天職。蓋以國貨工業，不特國家生産攸關。而百餘萬之工人生計，尤未可漠視也。</p>
<p>人民對於金融財政合作之起點</p>
<p>上述種種，幾無一而非悲觀資料，眞所謂内憂外患，交相煎迫，其勢且不可終日。然而多難振邦，國民懍於來日大難，實民族整個生存問題所繫，無可獨全，亦無可苟免，惟有合力奮鬥，以圖共渡難關。於是由散漫而團結，易倉皇爲鎭靜。於物質上極端破滅之餘，而國民精神上實有顯著之進步，或即民族復興之機乎。有可爲大書特書者三：</p>
<p>一金融界本身之合作我國金融同業之間，夙有兩行公會，錢業公會，銀錢兩業聯合會之設，惟都屬於友誼的聯絡，至業務方面，猶是各自爲政；散漫之象，在所不免，要無庸諱。即偶遇重大事變，而有暫時的共同措置，然事過境遷，每不能久，即有之，亦止限於一特定事業之結合，求其以共同保障爲目的，而作永久之組織者，前此蓋未嘗有。有之實自滬埠之銀行業聯合準備委員會始，繼起者爲滬埠錢業及津埠銀錢兩業。方一二八之變，滬埠金融業全體，實行罷市，以示同仇；然以戰禍延長，不能長此停頓，致增社會恐慌，旋於二月四日開市，復爲謀社會金融整個安寗，及各兩行實力充裕起見，爰有聯合準備委員會之組織。滬埠各銀行先後加入爲委員銀行者，二十六家，共認繳準備金達規元七千萬兩。組織公庫，發行公單，公庫證及抵押證。公單作用，在以替代現金，流通市面，委員銀行對於公單，負見票即付之責；公庫證得充發行銀行之保證準備；抵押證得爲委員銀行借欵之抵押品，旣以調劑同業，復可救濟市面。同時滬埠錢業公會亦組織一特别保管委員會，加入該會之錢莊，達七十家。凡加入者須交存財産二十萬兩以上，有交至百餘萬者，其交存總額最多時，達三千七百餘萬兩。多銀之家，可拆放該會，由該會拆放缺銀之家，以共同維護爲目的。同時杭州金融界亦有公庫及保管委員會之組織，公共準備金，定爲二百萬元，以維持鈔票之信用，及劃撥之便利，故杭州雖略有兌現風潮，旋即平息。後此則有津埠銀行錢業兩公會合緝之公庫，其目的在以免除現　之爲價及匯劃之困難。蓋津埠同業，每晚中　　久，必以支用外國銀行之支票充之；然外國銀行不　多收現洋存欵時即不易取得支票，而同業往來，　形扞格一商民苦之；金融業尤苦之，故有斯設。加入者銀行業二十家，錢業三十七家，收到存欵五百萬元，自此市面現洋過剩，可以公庫爲歸宿，不致泛濫充斥而落價；而同業會員撥帳，亦可由公庫支票撥兌，俾有調劑。此不僅津埠金融愈益穏固，其他各業，亦靡不直接間接同受其益也。</p>
<p>二人民對於金融界之合作一二八之役，爲滬埠空前大變，同時復有日艦砲擊南京之舉，國都遷洛，人心皇皇，社會恐慌，達於極點。丁兹艱危，金融　實首當其衝，故於銀行復市之日，人人咸惴惴以爲大規模之提存擠兌風潮，在所難免。在金融界方面，雖已準備以待，而不安之氣，實彌漫全市。然開市之一星期内，市面反異常安定，只以我行一行而論，不僅無擠兌之事；而發行反有增加。兹舉數字以明之（單位千元）：</p>
<p>月　　　日　　　發行額</p>
<p>一　　二九　　　一一九、七四三</p>
<p>一　　三○　　　一一九、八四一</p>
<p>二　　　一　　　一二○、一七○</p>
<p>二　　　二　　　一二○、二五○</p>
<p>二　　　三　　　一二○、二八○</p>
<p>二　　　四　　　一二一、二四四</p>
<p>二　　　五　　　一二一、八五四</p>
<p>二月六日至八日春節休假</p>
<p>二　　　九　　　一二二、四八○</p>
<p>以上爲本行滬地發行之數字，於事變最緊急時，仍有增無减。至於存欵，則支用之户數，較平日稍繁，然皆零星小數，藉以應付日用開支者，至大數提存之事，則絶無之，故提欵總額，與常態無異。本行如此，他行亦然。南京方面，在事變時，略有兌現之象，至二月七日後，即完全消泯，計七日之間，各行兌出現欵，仍如平時。此種安靜氣象，實在歷來發生内戰事變時所未有。此初不出於當局指導之功，亦非銀行本身所能爲力，而實由於人民普遍的自覺，及對於銀行之信用。誠以金融一經擾亂，社會必生動搖，而益予强敵以侵凌之機，此種鎭靜的態度，深刻的認識，實足以覘人民對於國家觀念之進步，而深值吾人感佩者。</p>
<p>三人民對於政府財政之合作我國數年以來，公債發行日見增加，每月還本付息數額，平均總在一千六七百萬上下。在政府早已瀕於捉襟見肘之勢。滬戰旣起，庫收益絀，金融界中人，不欲分政府對外之力，乃自動首倡將内債延本減息，藉以減輕財政上之負擔，集中對外力量。持票人均予贊同。計將本息數擔，平均輕減二分之一，年來財政得以維持者，太有賴於此也。一時債票價格暴落，金融界與持票人雖不免感受痛苦；而皆安之若素，此則愛國之心驅之使然也。</p>
<p>二十二年度之金融與金融政策之轉移</p>
<p>國難經濟損害之嚴重，農村經濟之衰落，國際貸借之逆勢，人民購買力之下降，内地資金之枯竭，旣如上述；則二十二年度之金融趨勢，可不待研求而知之。農民積蓄，愈耗愈盡，中等農家之儲蓄，不逾一二十元，其下者竟至求一元之現金而不可得。近來内地植桑之户，不能育蠶，問其故，則曰：不得一元以購蠶種。若占人口百分之八十之農民，求最低之生活而不可得，尚何購買力之可言。本年布廠營業虧損，即農民無力增添衣着之一證。今後即一切生活必需之工業製造品，亦恐銷路日狹，價格日跌；其他較有奢侈性質者，更不待言。工廠一受影響，上之國家統稅，下之工人生計，皆牽連受害。商店因所進貨，不數日即受跌價之虧損，於是相率不敢屯積。要知屯積貨物之投機行爲，爲構成物價與購買力之極大要素，無人屯貨，適以增進物價低落與購買力下降之速度，本年度内地商店紛紛倒閉，即其結。上海街面商號，本年度營業較去年減三分之一，預測明年將復去其一半，直接促進商號之閉歇，間接影響店員之生計。農民終歲勤勞，所獲不足以維持生活，勢必出於欠租欠糧，近來各縣徵收地丁，均不能足數。若今日之農村情形，不加改善，焉知不再發生抗租抗稅之舉。地方財政，固無法維持；而向來視爲最穏固之財産之田畝，今已失其流通資産之價值，此於國家總資産之損失，奚止數千萬萬。農村信用，向來農民依商號有富户爲週轉，商號富户依錢莊爲週轉，近以農民無力還欠，商號牽連倒閉，富户遷徙都市，錢莊存欵減而欠欵不能收回，因此或則閉歇，或則收縮，内地商業與農業之信用組織；完全破壞。近得一地報告：農民以一牛求押十元而不可得。以如斯之農村信用狀態，其農産衰落之趨勢，將愈趨愈烈而不可收拾。以上所述種種情形，若二十二年度無改善之望，則不自然繁榮之上海，恐亦不能長保其繁榮；而不景氣之現象，將追踵而至。上海不能以内地之衰落，而謂可獨保其繁榮；不能以内地資金保藏銀行之手，而謂可藉以增進上海之繁榮，凡有心經濟者，皆知其不可能。近來商業衰敗之象，固已事實昭著，所賴以支持上海之繁榮者，不外地産與工廠。地産價格，在表面上雖維持不見跌落；而實際大宗地産，照市價低減二三成，尚難覓得受主。工廠照目下購買力趨勢，已在戒備之中。是二十二年度之上海市面，恐亦將進於停滯衰頽之境，此亦關心金融者之未可忽視者也。</p>
<p>國民經濟之病態，旣如是其嚴重，財政政治將無一不受其波蕩，恐非全國上下有絶大覺悟，無以挽此危機。在政府必須有眞知灼見，分别緩急，削減一切不急務之消費；在人民必須刻苦砥礪，提倡節儉，排除一切不必要之浪費。於是政府與人民合其節省之資力，從事於改良生産；以政府與人民聯合統制，爲改良生産之途徑。蓋以非藉政府之權力，不能堅農民改進之信仰；非社會知識方面之助力，不能得技術上之補助；非金融界財力上之援助，不能促成改進方案之實現。遠者不必言，先從米、棉、麥、蠶四者設立聯合统制機關，從事改進，敢信三四年後，農産品或可不再外求；而農村經濟，或有恢復之一日。吾金融界處此局勢，似亦不可不轉易方針：向之以高利爭收存欵者，今旣不得適當之投資，宜聯合減低存欵利率，以免不自然之信用膨脹，而爲存户謀策萬全。向之墨守習慣之放欵利率者，今用欵者旣無負担高利之能力，宜共同減輕放欵利率，以示與生産者立於休戚與共之地位。向之投資視線集中於通商口岸者，今旣知非内地健康無以增進國民經濟之繁榮，宜尋覓安全之途徑，以集中之資金；散而還諸内地。向之博什一之利，以圖自身之生存者，今旣知非産業復興無由謀金融之發展，宜共同參　各種改良生産工作，以求資金之生産力與物産之生産力同共升降。並希望吾同業由上述消極自衛性質之合作，進而謀積極改進社會金融之合作。實以不如是，必因市面衰敗，營業之途徑愈狹，而相</p>

<p>國體保壽是解决人類現代難題的唯一善法，故在講述之前，須先略述人類之難題爲何。</p>
<p>當世之經濟之恐慌，不在經濟原理之不良，而在人民政府及各種事業不知應用其原理，最著者爲生産成本之中不能列入生活的工資，工資之僅足敷衍衣食住敎，而無餘資儲蓄，以爲失業疾病年老及身後之備者，不能稱之爲生活的工資非待此點爲大衆所共曉，而使生活的工資成爲事業的費用中第一項開支之後，勞資的感情無法成立，困難恐怖益將驅羣衆心理於反動之途，然而反動之說若行於公衆利益，必更有害而無利。</p>
<p>生活的工資若何實行之方法，不在本文範圍之内，其事重要必將逐漸因需要而得適當方法以解决，在未解决之前，羣衆之困難惟有公家解囊相助，斯或即爲公家保險之計畫，但屬根本不妥，而且有妨民德，</p>
<p>人之一生無時不有生活之需要，而人之生産能力在一生之中，祇以一個時期爲限，欲求一生之需要，全出於一個時期之供給，除在有生産能力之時期中，取得生活的工資以外别無他法。</p>
<p>本文宗旨，在於研究生活的工資中之一部份，如何可以科化的最佳最妥方法儲蓄，以防年老疾病或竟身故之所需，而讀者或聽者諸君當先明瞭此文之主旨，不在研究人壽保險之學術事業何由而成，如何管理，而在　明人壽保險之制度與人類幸福有必要之關係，且有多年之經騐足徵其爲唯一合理方法，可使人生一個時期之所儲，足供人生一世之所需而已。</p>
<p>保險爲普通儲蓄方法之科學化者，普通之儲蓄但能積少成多，歷時久而無把握，保險之方法則自開始繳付保費之時起，把握已在手中，任何個人或團體爲未雨綢繆之計者，均爲保險此項意識可以謂爲與生俱來，動物之中不乏預儲冬糧者，人類　識奈何不及動物，而現行經濟制度之缺點，即在食力之人多數未能於有生産能力之時，除當時之衣食住外，預備一生之需要。</p>
<p>自有人類即需保險，保險之最初事蹟，載在聖經，埃及約瑟夫在豐收之七年中，預儲食糧，乃能於七年旱災中，活人無算，此可謂爲最古之團體保壽。　　有團體保壽然後保壽之利益始易普及，團體保壽盛行以後，勞働界始能人人得到保壽之益，以前所行之退職養老金及失業救濟等各項制度，今皆可以包括於團體保壽之中。</p>
<p>團體保壽之名詞，流行未久，大實業或大機關之職工保壽公司，可用總保險單以承保之，其主要之點有二；一。保險公司爲免騐體格之准許；二。投保之機關須全體職工加入，無一能作例外，換言之，即不使不康健者獨來保壽，但流行雖尚不久，而效用已著，故進步甚速，兹撮一二紀錄，以爲印證。　　美國與加拿大去年在約祇十個月不足一年之時期中，各公司承保之團體險約達一百萬萬元，統計全年將有五萬一千户可得保壽之益，此項金額將爲八千九百萬元。</p>
<p>團體保壽在經濟上已成現代實業管理所必需考慮之事項，除中國外，已成勞資雙方公認之需要，用以保障工人之家庭，亦有兼及殘廢意外傷害等保障者，團體保險若不備具此數項之保障者爲不完全，而其代價均不難於計算。</p>
<p>語云，﹁天有不測風雲，人有旦夕禍福，﹂將其保障代價列入工資之中，乃爲人生幸福所不可缺少之條件，團體保壽之進步雖速，但其所給之保障，常因事業方面不能寛籌生活的工資，故受限制，不能完全，若不速圖糾正，則生活逼迫世界之不景氣勢，將有增無减。</p>
<p>職工之中固有力能單獨保險，但按保壽專門計算，投保團體保壽之機關，其所有職工，必使全體加入，任何職工不能獨異。</p>
<p>團體保壽中，所已公認不能列入者，爲失業之保障，本年一月十日日内瓦經濟會議時，統計二十個國家中，失業人數達三千萬，全年工資損失四十二萬</p>

<p>人壽保險含有両種人生常識：</p>
<p>苐一、﹁人無遠慮、必有近憂﹂、所以壯年要作老年的凖備、强健時要作疾病時的计畫。　　苐二、﹁日计不足、歲计有餘﹂以所以微細的金錢、只湏有長久的積聚、可以供重大的用度。　　　　　胡適</p>
<p>史帶君，保險界與新聞界鉅子也，現任上海美亞保險總公司總理，友邦人壽保險公司總理，友邦儲蓄銀行總裁，法美保險公司協理等職，又爲大美晚報主人，史氏美國加利福尼州産，年十六，即業商，已能操奇計赢，嶄然露其頭角，迭在某週報，銀行寳業公司，保險公司供職，工作之餘，潛心於學，研究法律孜孜不倦，至二十一歲，加州政府即給以律師榮銜，許其以法律問世，出入於各級法庭焉。一九一七年歐戰方酣，史氏入美陸軍，服役逾年，卸職來華，創辦遠東最大之美亞保險總公司及其他事業，閎才卓識，擘劃罔懈，成績彪炳，罕有匹儔。</p>

<p>世界上必須人人有工可作，調匀之分配之，須有生活的工資，並謀生活之改善，世界經濟無論因何恐慌，社會組織之根本原則决不搖動，人壽保險足使經濟安定，而團體保壽更爲勞働界之福音，勞資雙方之情感非此無從增進。總而言之，人壽保險乃人羣合作以增進人類幸福最良法則之一，使富力平民化，得平允之支配，而無赤貧之人，保壽公司所集之鉅資，乃人類各種優良之心理，如智慧，節儉，與犧牲，藉物質以所爲之表現，世人有欲以社會學說，代替經多年之發展，而成立之經濟原理及制度者否，此保壽公司所代表之國家富力，即食力民衆所儲之鉅資，足以鼓勵及報酬人類之良心者，足爲彼輩完美之答案，民界日在改進之中，而此人們一方自助，一方合作，之奇特制度，即人壽保險緣社會之需要，經悠久之試騐，今乃更盛於昔，由個人之投保，進而爲團體之保壽矣。</p>
<p>永明公司一年之新發展</p>
<p>新生意竟有坎拿大金洋二萬萬八千四百零九萬八千九百三十元</p>
<p>去年一年中，各業俱有不振氣象，而永明公司昨日舉行年會時，所發表之營業報告，仍有顯著之進步，擔認壽險總額結至去年十二月三十一日止，幾及坎拿大金洋三十萬萬元，一年中所接受之新生意，以保費照繳者爲限，竟有坎拿大金洋二萬萬八千四百零九萬八千九百三十元，而新保險單亦增多九萬五千一百二十二張，按世界商業之衰落，在西曆一九二九年即已開其端，而公衆對於壽險之信任心，則絲毫未受影響，可以永明公司之繼續發展而證明之，蓋自該年以迄上屆年終止，永明所發出之保險單與團體保險之證書，增多二十萬零五千張，擔認壽險總額增多坎拿大金洋四萬萬八千萬元，總資産增多坎拿大金洋四千三百萬元，現在共有坎拿大金洋六萬萬一千一百四十三萬六千一百五十二元，凡此發展，皆公衆對於壽險之信任心有以致之，决非偶然也，據年會主席麥考萊先生之意，關於全世界商業之回復，已有根本辦法，而不久將舉行之全世界經濟會議，應有極大之成功，在以前之經濟恐慌，平均不出二十個月，卽告中止，此次之經濟恐慌，已有三年零四個月，幾及往者之雙倍，此次經濟恐慌之特點，使人最感不安者，即爲各種物價之繼續低落，自一九二九年迄今，各物躉售之價，竟跌落至百分之三十五，遂使各業無利可圖，即有亦爲數極微，而各方之購買力，亦因之減小矣，事實如此，其結果可知，在近日方始稍見轉機也，繼主席而演說者爲永明公司之副總董與總經理華德先生，略謂公司在此三年之經濟恐慌中，有極强之抵抗力，在該期中保户增多二十萬人，現在共有一百萬人，擔認壽險總額幾增坎拿大金洋五萬萬元，而總資産亦增坎拿大金洋四千三百萬元，渠意壽險可以減小個人之經濟壓迫，而其他利益不計焉，彼謂在已往之經濟恐慌中，公司所付與保户及身後受益人之欵，每年平均有坎拿大金洋一萬萬元，壽險獲得公衆之信任，不自今始，因有健全之管理，方能得到如此之信任，而永明公司因一百萬保户之助力，得以繼續發展，良非偶然，彼之信任公司，有數事可以證明，即去年之新生意，一部份乃自老保户得來，而保險單之任其失效者，其數較往年爲少，據華德先生之意，上屆營業報告之特色，乃在鉅額之新生意，在全世界商業衰落之時，其數竟有坎拿大金洋二萬萬八千四百萬元之鉅，遂使擔認壽險總額增至坎拿大金洋三十萬萬元，其成績深堪驚人，至於投資方面，視前年無甚出入，去年投資，大部份限於坎拿大政府所發行之公債，有數種保證品去年因善價售出，所獲之利約有坎拿大金洋二十五萬元，而其他保證品之價，在造具報告時，亦大爲减低，遂使公司益見鞏固，去年總收入有坎拿大金洋一萬萬六千一百萬元，除去各項支出後，凈多坎拿大金洋一千三百餘萬元，今將公司每十年之發展列表於後，</p>

<p>在中國今日生活程度之下的兒童，自出世至十八歲或是二十歲間隔的時期中，都得依賴父母而生活。在這個時期，他家庭的負担，不僅是衣食住三事，并且還包括敎育訓練以及娱樂的花費。這些消費，（指敎育等）在往年皆視爲奢侈費，可是到了今日，他們已認爲是必需的了；因爲它們可以决定兒童將來事業的成敗與幸福。所以子女生活費以外的一切費用，皆可認爲是爲子女將來幸福和發展的投資，以及促進社會文明的獻物。人當少年時曾受好的敎育與訓練，將來到社會工作一定能獲得較高進欵。有很多人一生都是自養自立，到了老年却反依人而活。給兒童以良好敎育與訓練，致花費金錢，但是這確是用得適當并合經濟的原則。因爲這種投資有收回的時候。即算有時不能獲得他們所投資的數目，但整個的社會，因靑年人受着相當敎育的緣故，也得益匪淺。　　兒童在十八歲或二十歲以前，依賴父母而生活，是一種普通的自然現象。因這十八年或二十年中，是兒童預備一生工作的時期。從個人以及大而言之從社會的立塲看來，兒童當發育時代，正在受敎育與訓練時期，似乎不應有任何經濟上的負担若家主不幸死亡，又没有遺下資金可供給他的家庭直到兒女可以自立時，那末以下三件事中必有一件發生：（一）孀婦出外工作，（二）子女出外工作，（三）孀婦與孤子哀女都依靠慈善組織。今將各個的劣點逐加討論於次：　　（一）孀婦出外工作的劣點孀婦出外工作的問題，要看依賴她的工資而生活之人數而定。兒女愈多孀婦出外工作的需要愈迫切。但兒女當小時亟需要母親的照顧，母親若出外工作，兒女們勢必被遺在家中無人照顧，無人管理，他們不僅不能享受家庭的樂趣，還要因外界的引誘，易於得着惡劣的習慣。家庭敎育爲學校敎育的基礎，未曾受過良好家庭敎育的兒童，長大時很難成爲有用的人才。所以孀婦出外工作，子女們的敎育，與將來的幸福，都受很大的影響。此外孀婦因一方面在外工作，一方面又要主持家務，每每操勞過度以致早傷　　（二）童工的劣點在許多情形之下，兒童工作有損於他們將來的幸福，以及事業的成功。他們的敎育與訓練皆被阻止。他們日後事業的成功機會因之而銳减。他們常常只不過得到劣等位置。工資旣低將來發展的機會也是很少。他們時常須在不衛生不淸凈的環境裏工作。嘗試着機件意外事件發生的危險。暴露在公司惡劣環境之下，與一班没有高尚道德的男女混雜在一起工作。兒童常受種種成年人視爲很嚴重誘力的包圍。這種種誘力對於傭工的兒童！，没有好父母領導的兒童下所生的影響更大。因此他們的健康道德以及志氣必受打擊。　　（三）賙濟兒童的行爲的劣點賙濟的行爲對於多數無法維持生活的兒童，確有莫大裨益。不過假使另有方法可維持兒童的幸福，直到他們可以自己供給；那末就應該利用這種方法以替代賙濟的行爲。往年兒童慈善事業，與其他慈善組織相似，兒童每每須離開家庭，進濟貧院，孤兒院，或其他類似的組織。給他們以一種受賙濟的標記。使他們受大衆紀律的束縛，凡此種種由慈善組織的管理人員看來固很合適，不過從兒童的幸福上着想，未免太不自然。</p>
<p>人壽保險與依賴的兒童</p>
<p>現代的人，不僅要準備自身的需要，還得要負上爲將來承繼的下輩，以及曾經完畢工作的老人的給養責任。全國依賴工資的人中，百分之八十五每年的進欵不上二千元。他們當然無力儲存相當資金，以備意外的死亡來臨時，子女們的給養。不過藉人壽保險，覔食者至少可置備一筆基金，以備子女們數年内的瞻養費。譬如普通覓食者，非經許多年不能有千元的積蓄，爲身後子女們的生活費。但每年僅需三十元保險，一筆壽險産業立刻可以置備。這實好似預定千元在死亡時註消的貨欵，按年付償百分之三。如此每年只需少量儲蓄，而可担保子嗣們有千元的資産。按照今日的生活程度，千元可爲一兒童在四五年内，或數兒童在二三年内，做節儉的生活費。</p>

<p>（一）本埠石愚君來信</p>
<p>我現在是一個公司裏的小職員、因爲失業的威脅，我是如像雄聲君一樣想到鄉村裏去的，而雄聲君的情况，上有老母，下有妻子，失業後在城市裏要想找别的工作很不容易，也正和我的情况差不多一樣，所以我見着你替雄聲君設計回到鄉村去辦法，心裏很高興，將來我也可以照辦，可是看了你的辦法之後、陰暗的黑影，仍是包圍着我週圍、不僅是你所預期的，﹁一個鶴立雞羣的領袖人物﹂，那樣的壯志不能使我振奮，反而將我﹁回到家鄉去也許可以弄一碗飯吃﹂的幻想打得粉碎，據編輯先生的介紹，你是一個熱心主張鄉村敎育救國論者，對於鄉村敎育很有研究，而且又是一位實行家，想來你的見地是不會錯的，現在將我對於你的辦法，感到失望的地方，逐一寫出來，請你加予解釋和指正，若是眞的係能指導我們開闢出一條生路來的話，尤先生，如像我和雄聲一樣的靑年，現社會不知有許多，他們將要如何的感激你啊，（一）你的第一步辦法，在親友中籌措一二百元，我就辦不到，一二百元在你尤先生看來，也許是很小的數目，而在我們這些窮措大看來，却是非常居大的一筆欵子啊，而且，在這樣﹁世態炎凉﹂的社會，休說衆人是不會有闊親友的，卽使有，人家也要拿去放利息，或是做對於他有利可圖的事，誰肯拿來救濟我們這些無路謀生的人呢，你尤先生吤呌我們去籌措，却並授有替我計畫出還債的方法，誰肯憑空的送人一二百元啊，（二）雄聲君和我都是有老母妻子的，你的設計，却只是替一個人打算，我們並不是不會用極濟的方法來解决生活，浪費和窮人是不會相聯的，而是在於最低限度的生活資料無法獲得啊，老母妻子不能丢掉，等她們活活地餓死，找不着職業就是吃的住的都無法解决，還說得上夏天穿﹁什麽裝﹂冬天穿﹁什麽袍﹂呢，（三）卽使没有上述兩層困難，没有家屬的拖累也能够找着如尤先生的親友那樣的慷慨，　意借那末一二百元給我們，不簡直是送一二百元給我們，是不是就可解决個人的生活，而且堂領袖，救中國呢，我們分成三段來說，（一）個人的生活問題，如果像尤先生所指示的那樣節省，一二百元的確可以在鄉村過兩三年的，但是說到辦學校維持永久生活的話問題，却不是這樣簡單了，中國農村敎育，爲什麽這樣落後呢，是知識分子不顧到農村裏去嗎，抑或是農村不要知識分子揷足呢，據尤先生的話說起來，到鄉村去的先决條件是﹁是你否愛好鄉村﹂之類，自然是知識分子不願到鄉村了，尤先生的家鄉是怎樣，我不知道，我的家鄉却是不要知識分子呢，第一，在帝國主義的經濟侵略之下，我的家鄉是破産了，因爲帝國主義相互衝突而演出來的不斷軍閥混戰，更予農村經濟極度的摧殘，在災荒兵亂苛捐雜稅高利貸···種種壓迫和剥削之下的農民他們終歲勤勞尚不能獲得一飽，那裏還有什麽遺力來顧及子女的敎育呢，任我們怎樣抱犧牲精神，不收學費筆墨紙書籍等等的負担，他們已經不能勝任了，何况還要他們納一隻雞，或是一隻鴨，或三十個雞蛋呢，而且鄉下的兒童到了求學的年齡，並不如像城市兒童一樣無所事事的，他們到了五六歲，便可以去放牛砍柴，做種種輕便的工作，貧窮而又辛苦的那些農民們，並不像尤先生那樣有思想，呌他們犧牲可以帮忙的子女來讀﹁飢不可以爲食寒不可以爲衣﹂的書，的確有點兒辦不到呢，第二，當然農村中也不一定完全是赤貧的農民有錢的地主固然跑到城市裏了，勉强可以維持供給兒女讀一點書的中農，也是有的，可是，我們要曉得他們的前途是非常黑暗，他們已經逐漸的走向赤貧的路了，把他們的事業寄在這些人上面，希望吃這些人來維持我們個人的生活，結局是仍不勉要餓死的，第三，我們知道尤先生所說的路，並不是没有人走，許多前情的秀才之類，已經老早走到裏面去了，就是拿我們文化最落後的省份來說，貴州只要有十家農人住的村落，必定有兩三個私塾，若是到幾百家人的市鎭，那就會有什麽掛牌的小學校出現了，農村一天一天的凋零，人口逐漸向都市移動，又在極度的貧乏之下，農村還有力量吸收我們這些無法謀生的知識階級嗎，尤先生其有以告我否，（二）　於雄聲君是否可以做一個鄉村的好領袖，我並不認識雄聲君，但據雄聲自己說起來却是謙虚得很，只是一個一無所長，只會寫幾個字的人，我呢，的確只是一個一無所長的人，尤先生和雄聲君認識嗎，我想恐怕不致於吧，假若雄聲君早和尤先生相識，他必定已經受尤先生的指導到農村裏去了，何致於還會寫信請讀者顧問欄的記者解决他本身的問題呢，那末尤先生是從什麽地方知道雄聲君可以做鄉村的領袖呢，假若凡是會寫字的都可以做鄉村的領袖，我也可以麽，前淸的那些秀才們也可以麽，尤先生，你是一個提倡鄉村敎育的人，你心目中的鄉村敎師，要具備些什麽條件呢，我們拿些什麽去敎鄉村的兒童呢，我們怎樣去領導那些雙重壓迫之下的農民呢，（三）至於說到鄉村敎育是否可以救國的問題，我不是敎育家，不會了解，不過我總覺得社會的組織是根本基於經濟，經濟無辦法，政治必紊亂，在貧乏的經濟、</p>
<p>和紊亂的政治之下，一切建設是都是空談，都是欺騙，文化事業也是不能例外的，而要中國的經濟前途有希望掃出帝國主義及其一切寄生的勢力爲唯一先决的條件？其他都是瞎話，不過，尤先生旣以爲鄉村敎育可以救國，我爲信服編輯先生的介紹，也是極想拜聆高論的，總之，中國現在的農村，眞的可以回去嗎，鄉村可以復興嗎，鄉村敎育眞可以挽救中國嗎，中國的靑年唯一的出路是担任鄉村敎育嗎，請尤先生給我一個回答，至於辦合作社進行村治等等問題，我想留着給有研究的人來討論，我是不置緣了輪了，</p>

<h3 id="c201">湯二虎 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— 瞻盧</p>
<p>從瀋陽歸來的商界某君，對於承德淪亡，十二分的痛惜；以爲，辜負了關外三千萬人民的盼望！</p>
<p>關外的民衆，尤其是商人，都深盼着熱戰好消息。他們以爲敵軍宣言攻熱，已有一年有餘的悠久時間；料想張少帥抱着﹁殺父之仇不共戴天﹂的憤恨，守熱河的湯二虎，又是個血性男子，老帥在時尚怕他三分；又有了充分布置，敵軍來犯，何難把他們驅逐出境？乘勢還有收復遼吉黑的希望。誰料，接觸未久，日本報紙上已大登其侵熱勝利消息：什麽小隊一百餘人唾手而得承德，什麽攻人古北口只死一人，傷二人。他們都是搖頭不信，以爲出於日人的假宣傳。這番，趁着某君回鄉之便，便託他探取熱戰眞相，設法報告，俾得解釋他們的懷疑。</p>
<p>某君回來後，事實告訴他，竟和日本報紙上的宣傳一鼻孔出氣！湯二虎逃亡了！張少帥南下了！似這般的不祥消息，要是寫信報告與關外同胞知曉，豈不閉絶了他們的希望之門？豈不開通了他們的涕涙之泉？</p>
<p>張少帥報仇不報仇？暫時閣起，留待下回分解。有人說：這位素有血性從前老帥在時怕他三分的湯二虎，未免玷辱了﹁二虎﹂美名，俗稱實力充足的呌做九牛二虎，他配稱二虎麽？與其稱二虎，不如稱一蟹；不待兵臨城下便逃走了，比着其他的逃將，可說是﹁一蟹不如一蟹﹂了。與其稱一蟹，不如稱一鴨；他的抗日電報，何等慷慨悲壯？應了一句﹁湯罐裏熝鴨獨出一張嘴﹂的俗語。而且，他的棄職濳逃已證實了，他又有通電說要奪回承德，可見他的一張鴨嘴，依舊没有軟化咧，喚一聲湯一鴨，才是名實相符。</p>
<p>又有人說：湯二虎是對内的虎，不是對外的虎；他對於老百姓，確是吃人不吐骨頭的虎，他對於矮脚虎，便不成爲虎而成爲抱頭鼠竄的﹁鼠﹂了。照此說來，他也可以喚一聲湯一鼠。</p>
<h3 id="c202">復辟 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 百合</p>
<p>做皇帝是走遍天下没有再高尚而有味的職業，一國之内，惟我獨尊，要怎樣便怎樣。皇帝說屁是香的，誰敢揑着鼻子，把眉皺一皺。因爲做皇帝，再舒服不過，於是阿貓，阿狗，大六子，小三子，雖然具備了一副不堪承敎的尊範，死也自謂五岳朝天，生有帝王之相，夢想九五之尊。但是在下沉機觀變，覺得在這下元局運，做皇帝也不夠甚味兒。今天還堂而皇之，受萬千臣庶，嵩呼萬歲，半夜裏革命爆發，不到天明，說不定會被革命黨從熱被窩裏拖出來，流配到荒島上去。</p>
<p>打碎了御飯碗的萬歲爺，不吃一刀兩段，斬首示衆的苦頭兒，而僅流居荒島，或隠居異國，這是五行八字生得好，至少有鴨蛋大的紫薇星照命，打碎御飯碗，不過是暫時韜光養晦。有朝一日，困龍得水，依舊可興風作浪，捲土重來，重登龍位，道寡稱孤。</p>
<p>世界上的事，據說，都跳不出循環造化，天地，陰陽的圈套。泰極否來，否極泰來，人們，就老是在這裏面翻跟斗。各國的政治趨勢，也是如此。專制政治到了最高峯，便不免來一下民主政治。民主政治膨脹得成了膨病，來一下社會制，待到社會制成了個半身不遂，於是乎﹁你不好，打倒你，我來幹﹂，舞臺一轉，龍套登塲，廢帝復辟，來一幕獨裁政治。於是乎失業已久的萬歲爺，又找到了御飯碗。雖然這一幕新排的復辟喜劇，能否賣一個滿座，而不被觀衆喝倒采，没有把握，可是留着一位五岳朝天，紫薇照命的名角兒，總不免牙癢癢地，來一下眞刀眞槍，三本鐵公鷄。</p>

<p>— 徐木熙</p>
<p>春姑娘終於又嬌羞她來到江南了，靜穆的農村爲要裝飾大自然的美態，所以紅花照例地開放出來，小鳥在枝頭活躍地歌唱，都市裏的紳士階級和哥兒小姐們，受了宇宙愛育的吸引，喊一聲：﹁春到人間，是野遊時候了，我們來舉行Picnic﹂，她怡情逸緻的人們啊！咱們不需要你們來。</p>
<p>你們爲了田野詩人的歌詠而來尋趣的吧？你們爲了久經厭倦都市生活來吸吸新鮮空氣的吧？去！農村爲你們傷了，從今而後，再不放資本主義的臭氣冲進農村一步！</p>
<p>可憐地，我們身邊没一塊現洋了；可憐地我們累積的的辛勞換得了殘破的創痕，是你們把咱們的錢吸收去的，是你們把咱們的錢輸到外洋去的！你們還要說到農村去，農村没有西裝漆皮鞋的喲！瞧！咱們的布衣淡飯！</p>
<p>你們只會享樂，你們不知道人間疾苦；你們看見漁父在溪邊埀釣，你們要說：﹁好靜趣雋永的游戲﹂。你們知道一天收獲還不夠一家餬口嗎？罷了，你們始終來破壞我們農村的，去！資本主義臭味十足的人們。</p>
<p>我們有我們的園地，我們的靑山綠水是大衆的，我們的田野生活是共同的，我們的春是幽美的，可絶對用不了你們來改造，農村根本是原始的！</p>

<p>江氏當日接着趙家那一大碗燉牛肉，他心裏受着一種很大的剌激，心裏就這樣想着，假使我的孩子是個兒子，不也就這一樣，能燉着大碗牛肉我吃嗎？可是轉念一想，世上靠兒子養老的也多得很，幾個養老的兒子能夠燉牛肉老子娘吃。這同街就有兩個老人是靠兒子的，結果是兒子都穿好的，吃好的，老人家却窮得可憐，這樣子看起來，說是有了兒子老年就有了靠身，這話未免太靠不住了。眞不必有趙連長這樣一個兒子，就是有這樣一個女婿，也就令人心滿意足了。我看趙家父子，對我家裏這樣親熱週到，莫不是要想和我家提親罷。再憑我這丫頭的意思看起來，伊向來是瞧不起軍人的，但是對於這位趙連長，無論在當面，或者在背後，總是說趙連長好，莫不是這孩子心眼裏，也有了趙連長不成？他這樣想着，便覺得越來越像，趁此機會，把女兒的终身大事定了，也是作父母的人，應有的責任。他想定了，到了這日晚上，坐在坑上，和桂枝兩個人，共了一盞煤燈坐在坑上縫衣服。娘兒倆閒談着，桂枝又問到那牛肉好吃不好吃？江氏低了頭只管捧了衣服在手，穿針引線閙個不停。對於女兒，好像是很不注意的樣子，隨便的答道：怎麽不好吃？咱們家一年能吃幾回呢。桂枝道：我也是這樣說，我們家没有吃大葷的日子，所以趙老太爺送給我，我也不辭就端了回來了。江氏道：是呀！老太爺也是瞧見咱們家窮，所以送這碗牛肉給我們吃，他爺兒倆的心眼都好。說着，他將頭抬了一抬，眼睛藏在眼鏡框子裏，向桂枝瞟了一眼，見桂枝還是坦然的在那裏聯衣裳縫，因又道：趙連長爲人更好。</p>

<p>— 雨靑</p>
<p>在澡堂子裏揑脚，别有風味，全身披掛了大毛巾或浴衣，仰躺在坑床上，把脚伸得筆直；擱在坐在矮凳子上的揑脚人的膝蓋上，你閉目凝神，或抽着烟捲兒，給他揑，如果揑得不癢不痛；反而覺得脚丫裏有些兒發癢，那你一定要把頭微微地抬起，對揑脚人輕輕地說；﹁重些﹂！揑脚人使勁幾下，這一陣快活，使你﹁飄飄然如羽化而登仙﹂，這時候的你，二隻眼珠兒就會得矇朧起來，說不定你的嘴角兒也會自動地牽到耳根邊；以表示你此刻正在感受這一陣麻酥酥地嘗到一部份的肉的快感，不過，這一陣快活一過，對不起，你的脚丫已給揑破了皮，覺得脚丫裏發痛了，你喫了這痛苦，自討的；不能發脾氣怪揑脚人手脚太重，只能把頭第二次微微地抬起，臉上扮着﹁適可而止﹂的神色、</p>
<p>，輕輕地對揑脚人說；﹁好了﹂！揑脚見你脚丫裏皮綻肉碎，破毛巾上沁着一絲絲的血跡，馬上洒粉來塗飾，没有别的話說。</p>
<p>這次，前國聯會日本首席代表松岡洋右，在芝加哥旅次向日僑演說，有這樣二句話；﹁吾人使用武力，務求適可而止，﹂　　全中國四萬萬同胞，請瞧吧！就是這麽一回事，没有别的話說</p>

<p>— 定明</p>
<p>﹁兒童﹂，﹁兒童﹂，這是多麽香，甜，温軟的動聽的名詞！兒童，兒童，這是多麽充滿着熱烈與光明的向上的活躍分子！</p>
<p>從大一方面說吧！兒童是國家未來的主人翁，是文化轉移的中心點，也就是從現世紀轉變到未來大同極樂世紀的樞紐。</p>
<p>譬喻說；兒童好比黑夜裏燦爍的星，也好比照耀寰球的閃閃的電。好比東流的軟軟的水，也好比草木萌動的嫩芽。好比鮮花的蓓蕾也，，也好比幻想中的安琪兒丨丨丨小天使。</p>
<p>兒童是每個人生命中灼灼的火花，是每個人的心肝，是每個人生活中無形的興奮劑，也是每個人生命中的元素，是每個人的活寶貝，命芽與命根。也是人類中有聲有色有形的活活的主宰；没有兒童，便没有了世界。兒童是人們心靈的唯一安慰者，没有兒童，便無異自己將自己的生命，宣告了死刑，像那有智識的獨身主義者的處女們，便是自己執行自己做﹁無期徒刑﹂的囚徒代表。</p>
<p>兒童現在的身體健全，便是未來成人身體健全的象徵；兒童現在的精神健全，便是未來學識與民族，事業健全的朕兆。</p>
<p>兒童的心地，賽過雪花，是最純潔不過的；没有成人的虚僞，狡滑，誇張，染上了重重的色素；幾乎染得一榻糊塗，汩没了自己的童眞，消失了本來面目。</p>
<p>兒童是無冠冕的皇帝，跳跳躍躍，說說笑笑，哭哭呌呌，很自由，很平等，兒童的舉動是很自然的！很偉大的！很美麗的！餓了便呱呱的啼，飽了便不管是大庭廣衆之間，或南面王之前，放屁，拉屎，不同成人在人前說人話，在人後說鬼話。</p>
<p>樹枝椏間的喜鵲窠，探不上，他偏要探，兩手兩足猴子般攀援，不到幾尺，跌下來，但兒童是有堅决的貫澈的精神的！一天，兩天，终於爬上去了！</p>
<p>兒童是最知足，最富於冒險性而最具大無畏精神的；﹁乖乖！火！火！火火！﹂他不相信，手指一觸哭了！從此再不敢了！以後便增强相信大人的話的成分了！</p>
<p>兒童時期的生活是人生頂快樂的生活，高興了滾滾，走走，跑跑，跳跳；倦了，不但睡搖籃，而且要躺在母親的懷裏胭着；大了春天放風箏，夏天到公園踏着芳草打要要，或蝴蝶般穿樹林；秋天釣釣魚，鐶鐶鷄，或臥在梁莖堆中晒太陽；冬天在家裏圍着爐火，取暖。</p>
<p>然而，滿臉汚泥，沿街呌賣的是兒童；叔打嬸駡弟妹笑的也是兒童。衣裳襤褸瘦骨磷𥒘的是兒童，目不識丁，傻頭傻腦的也是兒童；遇節過時，死氣沉沉的是兒童，性情詭僻，舉動乖張的也是兒童：見人乾哭，逢人伸手的是兒童，翹着足，彎着腰，狗一般跳，猴一般舞的也是兒童；夏天火傘高張，都市裏：赤着脚，流着汗，﹁凉咦哟！買氷喲！﹂的是兒童：冬天挑着爛簸籮拾枯枝的也是兒童，鄉村裏一根長杆挑着小劇剷，趕一羣羊上高山圪塔迎太陽出，送太陽歸的是兒童，磕着牙關，擻擻打冷戰，在沙裏淘金般篩藍炭（二世煤）的也是兒童。兒童！兒童！有各種各樣的好，也有各種各樣的壞；有各種各樣的幸運，也有各種各樣的倒霉，是父母的過，也是社會的罪；是封建遺傳的毒，更是當前智議份子和掌握政治權威者的不盡責任。</p>

<p>— 郁連夫</p>
<p>最近的報上，正在喧傳着一位奔走南北的國民黨老同志的談話，說，政府已具絶大决心，准要把政權開放了。？</p>
<p>政權開放，由我們這些絶對不曾嘗過政權滋味的小百姓猜來，大約總不外乎是有飯大家吃，有官大家做的意思。以後天下太平，大家都有個前程，你也可以不必爭，我也可以不必閙，雍雍穆穆，歡聚一堂。掛起國旗，套上皮帶，詩人得預備去做個詩官，做小說的也少不得去做點稗官，聽說北平的女子，且早巳趕上了做女巡官，照這樣子，大家做官，對外則共赴國難，對内則預備立憲丨這四字在滿淸光緒年間也曾哄動過一時丨蒸我髦士，縻爾好爵，天下英雄，入吾彀中，豈不盛哉，豈不快哉。</p>
<p>但仔細一想，我們有的是四萬萬同胞，任你把委員議員的數目，增加到無以復加，大約總也容不了四萬萬個烏官。并且能者多勞，要人親人，至少也得兼攝着十七八個顯職，衙門是八字開的，憲法是紙上寫的，呌化子扮作春官，一夢邯鄲，後來的二百記大板，可眞消受不了。所以寒酸慣了的我們這些窮骨頭，還是趁早來鞏固鞏固我們的民權，倒來得實在些。</p>
<p>我想政權旣要開放，何以民權却偏要那麽的封閉。一本馬氏文通，居然可以做危害民國的證據，一篇訴窮的小說，竟也搆得成一記個新聞者的死罪。此外還有數不淸的許多不吃羊肉，略帶羊羶氣的政治嫌疑犯，一次紀念先哲的集會，也得早去叩禀，必待核准，方好施行。諸如此類的事實，眞很多很多，多得記不勝記，我想政權旣要開放，民權又何必必封閉得這麽緊呢？</p>
<h3 id="c209">裁縫三富 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— 彭雪珍</p>
<p>外面是冷的風，冷的雨，冷的空氣。屋子裏是陰森林的，小油燈的微弱的光在黑暗裏打抖。三富躺在滿墊着稻草的舗上，喘咳着，額上滲着汗，一臉油膩，嘴吧周圍長着雜亂的黑鬚，小眼睛被那緊皺着的眉頭擠更更小。</p>
<p>雖已經是四十六七的人了，但病得三四天不起來，生平還是頭一次。他知道怎麽﹁忍﹂的，非到實在支撑不住的時候，不肯睡下；這一回，可眞有點兒不由自己做主。起初雖然抱着﹁由他去﹂的神情，挨過了一兩天，但結局終於睡下了。</p>
<p>從八九歲起，就拿針弄線的在裁縫舗</p>
<p>裏當學徒，鞋底子也不知吃過不少，額上至今還留着一塊寸多長的傷疤。爲着這個，後來三富好容易煞得當了掌舗之後，從來没有打過學徒。</p>
<p>雖然當了掌舗，但三富那勞碌貧苦的命運，並没有改變了多少。並且因爲成了家，生活的重負，反倒把他壓得動不得。</p>
<p>前年更是倒霉，出乎意外的把個女人死了，除開一個八歲一個九歲的男孩子之外，還留下一個没滿月的女孩子。三富傷心得没有眼涙，只是望着天發呆。棺材賬直到去年中秋才還淸，險些兒還遭了討賬的先生的打。</p>
<p>死了女人後的三富，生活好像失了目的似的，甚麽都没勁。可是一想到自己女人留下的在個孩子，便只有更加勤奮的縫，更加努力的在街上奔跑。</p>
<p>要三富做衣裳的雖不少，但等到衣裳做好了，伸着手問人家討工錢時，那臉嘴却眞不易受！雖然他開的價比别的裁縫都公道，但人家總是瞪着眼：﹁節邊來拿，不賴你的就是丨﹂可是到了節邊去討時，却又是：﹁下節來拿，還會逃掉嗎？﹂</p>
<p>顧主們的工錢雖是一節拖一節，夥計們的工錢却是不能拖延的，每到月底，三富不知道要講多少好話，費多少心思，才能敷衍過去。遇着當葷的日子，忘不了多買半斤肉請夥計，好使大家起勁點。</p>
<p>最怕的是削人指尖的冬天，活做得特别慢，而穿的人却恨不得今天裁明天拿。三富聽夠了顧主們凶狠的吩咐，便再三再四的央求老王老李做夜工，兩角不肯就三角，自已也陪着加緊的縫。可是做完送，去顧主還說是做得太粗，錢要年底拿。三富祗好呌苦；這是睜着惺忪的睡眼縫的呀！</p>
<p>這時屋子裏響着兩個孩子的酣聲。想起來了：大寶昨天不是吵着要做新罩袍麽？人家笑大寶，怎的爸爸當裁縫還不穿得整齊點，是啊，只這個月再也省不下一塊錢了。二寳要交什麽費，說是明天開會買點心吃的，昨晚他還求二寳；﹁好乖，明天下午你别上學不行嗎？﹂二寳可就爲這個抓着他的被角哭了半個鐘頭。小毛的貼奶錢也逼着要付了，三塊錢一月，夠受的！</p>
<p>現在自己又病倒了，活不能做，還要化錢看大夫，買藥。怨誰呢，自己太不自量了，爲着給秦老太爺趕壽衣，三天三夜没打一個盹兒，錢没拿着就病了。咳嗽氣喘，腰背不能動彈，像夾着槍子兒似的痛，肩膀總是酸得像要碎了似的。可是，在這深夜，他不敢大聲呻吟，怕吵醒了夥計們的好睡，明天又不能做工。</p>
<p>三富倦了，低聲喘着氣，矇朧中，計算着明天的柴米，大寶的新褂子，二寳的兩毛錢會費······</p>
<p>這命不知要苦到什麽時候才會止的！</p>
<h3 id="c210">托翁談女性 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— 石徑斜</p>
<p>在許多文學家中，對於女性，托爾斯泰可算是很常提及者之一。不論在論文中，在戲曲小說裏，他總是用一種嚴刻冷峭的態度來批評現社會制度，而以一種寛大的口吻來替無辜的婦女辯護。他在﹁克連謝格槐曲﹂中曾這樣地說：﹁······那些强制手段（醫治梅毒的强制手段）不用來滅除淫慾反而去獎勵淫慾；保證淫慾的没有危險，這算什麽一回事呢？那件可怕的事差不多没有人不遇着，靑年人不用說，恐怕有十分之九都受過這個苦痛，甚至連鄉下的農夫都不能免。這個原因，並不是因爲婦女有蠱惑人的手段，婦女是决不會蠱惑人的；那是因爲有些人，把淫慾看做法定的，有益於衛生的事，還有些人把它當做是一種少年人最自然並　絲毫没有罪惡的玩意之故。······</p>
<p>實際，托　斯泰，在日常談話之間，一論對女性，便會發出滔滔不斷的妙論。有一次他碰到高爾基，以高所作的短篇小說﹁二十六人和一少女﹂爲話題而論到女性的貞節。托翁說：﹁貞節嗎﹂？這在身體健康，發育完全的小姐們，確是很不自然的一件事。過了十五歲的女性，假使她是身體健康，發育完全的，那末她心裏一定很喜歡給異性摸揑和擁抱！不過在另一方面，她的腦海裏對於一種她還不明白，還没有經騐過的事情，却很担心着：所謂﹁貞節﹂﹁潔白﹂﹁無瑕﹂的觀念者，就是在這一點。然而無論心裏怎樣地担心着，她的肉總以爲這種她還没有充分明白的事情，是一種正當而合法的行爲，所以不斷地要求她履行這種法則！﹂</p>
<p>有一次，他同柴霍甫散着步的時候，突然開口問柴霍甫說：﹁喂！老兄！你年紀輕的時代一定狠嫖樂過吧！﹂柴霍甫没有回答，祗吃吃地苦笑。托翁又眺望着海面，若有所思地說：﹁事實，對於女性我也是很喜歡而不知倦厭的！﹂還有一次，高爾基和柴霍甫等圍談着女性，托翁坐在傍邊傾耳靜聽了好久，然後才開口說：﹁對於女性的正體眞相嗎？那等到我一隻脚踏進了墳墓後再說吧！那時，等說出了後，我想馬上跳入棺材裏，急急地把棺蓋蓋上，而後呌說：﹁喂！隨你們的意做吧！﹂哩！</p>

<p>就在這樣環境裏，他漸漸長成，工廠，把他鍊成了鐵骨銅筋，他堅忍的性格，也在這裏養成，他時時吐出憤慨的呼聲！</p>
<p>他懂得了要生活便只有奮鬥，要堅强的隊伍，才有堅强的力量。他號召大衆，從地獄裏興起！但可憐他却終於上了﹁屠塲﹂！</p>
<p>現在，他的尸身雖已成了塵土，他的名字還刻在一些人的心上！他是在悲哀和苦痛裏生長！他是在悲壯的戰爭裏死亡！</p>

<p>於是人想像着那些獰惡的帝國主義者的走狗丨丨租界的包打聽和巡捕，專𠯘吮同胞們的血的獸類。此外還有外國的猛獸，特别是虹口一帶的巡捕，在北四川路上，大搖大擺地向着兩側的蒼灰色的臉孔所有者的支那人獰笑着走過去的日本巡捕。他雖然痛恨他們，但一面又害怕他們。前天在分部裏，有一位同志曾這樣慷慨激昂地演講，與其給他們，丨丨那些帝國主義者慢慢地宰割而死，那就不如早一天和他們及其走狗們拚一個你死我活，還比較痛快。個人的生活本來是没有多大意義。我們的同志要爲社會奮鬥，要爲廣大的貧苦羣衆的生活鬥爭。我們坐在亭子間裏念社會主義的書籍，寫社會主義的文章，是没有何等的意義的。我們需要行動，丨丨需要革命的行動！</p>
<p>在當時海泉的熱情確是給這個委員的演說煽動起來了，跟着大衆鼓了掌，他想立刻走上反帝國主義的最前線去。</p>
<p>到後來是參加示威遊行的表决，全體通過。但是散會後走出來，給街路上的冷風一吹，海泉的熱情又不知消散到什麽地方去了。</p>
<p>﹁這是一種冒險！絶大危險的冒險！﹂</p>
<p>於是他又想着了鶴子夫人，想着了佩珠，想着了卓叔華，甚至於想着了曹世光夫人，隨後又想着了住在南國鄉間的老祖母和父母。由家中的父母便聯想到家裏錢尚未匯到。</p>
<p>﹁幹吧！勇往直前地幹下去吧！中國好男兒，不應該這樣的怯懦！這是中國靑年不能辭其責的工作丨丨丨解放中華民族的工作，爲廣大的貧苦民衆謀出路的工作﹂！</p>
<p>他拿着這封信在痴想。他想像到給巡掃拉到捕房裏去時的景况。他也想起了那些住過西牢的先進們說給他聽過的牢裏的痛苦。他又有些心驚肉跳起來了。</p>
<p>﹁林先生，是從那裏寄來的信，看得那樣起勁，是不是情書﹂？</p>
<p>秋英抱着小孩子走前來，笑向他說。她的臉差不多是靠在他的一隻臂膀上來了。他又聞着了一陣香氣，好一會，他没有開口，只翻看了她一怱，不覺笑了。</p>
<p>﹁給我看，可以麽﹂？</p>
<p>她紅着臉笑問他。</p>
<p>﹁你看不懂的﹂。</p>
<p>他笑着把那封信　進衣袋裏去了。</p>

<p>The main force of the Japanese army is concentrated south of Shimen Village and Liujiang, with no trace of the enemy beyond.</p>
<p>Enemy reinforcements are successively arriving from outside the pass and will launch a counterattack within days.</p>
<p>Our army has occupied the Wangzizhuang Heights, and a special force has also captured Yangzhuang.</p>
<p>Japan plans to occupy Beiping and Tianjin by the end of April; enemy warships are reportedly eyeing Beidaihe.</p>
<p>There were no major battles on the front lines yesterday.</p>
<p>(Luanzhou) Haiyang victory, Qinbu crisis resolved, market restored, people's hearts turned at ease. (Eighth dispatch)</p>
<p>(Luanzhou) He Zhuguo returned to Luanzhou from the front lines this afternoon and went to Luan Hospital to comfort the wounded at Shen hour. After the enemy's advance was thwarted, their combat strength has weakened. There were no major battles on the front lines all day on the eighth, only small units harassed, all of which were repelled. The enemy now occupies the route from Shimen Village to Liujiang, constructing solid fortifications with various obstacles, heavily set up, and buried a large number of landmines, sealing off important roads. On one hand, they are taking a defensive posture to prevent our army from counterattacking. On the other hand, they are reorganizing their remaining forces, waiting for reinforcements to arrive before resuming the offensive, in order to achieve their ambition for the Luan River. There may be more fierce battles in the next two or three days. Our army has already broken through the difficult pass east of Luan with one blow, taking the lead in occupying the Liujiang line, with the main force firmly defending both banks of the Tang River. The fortifications are solid, the troop strength is gradually increasing, and morale is high, awaiting the enemy's small-scale advances with small-scale resistance, and large-scale advances with all-out resistance. (Eighth dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) At three o'clock this morning, our army launched a general offensive against Shimen Village. There were fierce battles in Liujiang, Wangzizhuang, and Shijiadao. The enemy seems to be retreating towards Shahe Village. (Eighth dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Qin Island dispatch: The remaining enemies on the left bank of the Tang River, in Wangjialing, Wujiazhuang, and the surrounding area, have been cleared. The enemy has retreated about twenty miles from Qin Island. After the 101st and 7th trains on the Beining Railway arrived at Qinbu, the empty cars still returned to Beidaihe to stop running. They will reopen to Qin Station the next day. There are very few passengers. Three enemy armored vehicles on the east bank of the Shi River once returned to Yuguan Station last night and headed out again at 1:00 this morning. This morning, they fired dozens of shells at our positions in the areas of Hujiazhai and Wulitai. Our army also returned fire with artillery. (Eighth dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Qin Island dispatch: After our cavalry Wang's unit and Li Jin's units recovered the positions in Haiyang, Tanghe, and other places on the 7th, the enemy and puppet troops suffered nearly a thousand casualties, and over two hundred were captured alive. The enemy fled along the Liujiang Railway. A part of our Wang's cavalry unit and a part of the infantry unit pursued and engaged in a fierce battle near Liujiang on the evening of the 7th, and then occupied it. Our army continues to advance, aiming to recover Shimen Village in one fell swoop. Another cavalry unit and another infantry unit were transferred to attack Shimen Village from a certain place on the side. The vanguard sentries had already made contact with the enemy on the morning of the 8th. (Eighth dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The enemy in Suizhong has transferred more than 3,000 reinforcements from Wanjiatun, Jiumenkou, and other places to reinforce Shimen Village, carrying twenty heavy artillery pieces, eight tanks, and six small armored vehicles, and is launching a counterattack against our army. (Eighth dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Today at 5:00, our □th Brigade cavalry Wang's unit and Xu's unit engaged in a fierce battle with the enemy's Iwata Detachment in the Nanlin, Beilin, and Caizhuang areas. The two sides fought fiercely for a killing slope in Wangzizhuang, engaging in multiple hand-to-hand combats, resulting in heavy casualties. The Wangzizhuang Heights were finally occupied by our Xu Regiment. Our army is now flanking Liangjiashan, advancing towards the left wing of Shimen Village. Yangzhuang, near Shimen Village, has been occupied by our special force. Our army is exceptionally brave, and reinforcements are arriving at their destinations one after another.</p>
<p>Morale is greatly boosted. (Eighth dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Luanzhou dispatch: After our army's counterattack yesterday greatly thwarted the enemy's advance, the enemy suffered heavy losses and was in a state of utter defeat.</p>
<p>The morale is greatly reduced. The main force of the enemy's remaining forces are now gathered in Shizhai, actively constructing defensive fortifications.</p>
<p>There are no enemy traces in the area south of Liujiang. Our army's most advanced units have advanced to an area twelve miles from Shimen Village. The positions of our army on the east bank of the Tang River are becoming increasingly consolidated. The Qin Island crisis has been resolved, and the market has recovered. He Zhuguo is still directing military affairs in Haiyang Town.

<h3 id="e28">Is There A Sudden Change in American Policy? <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Former Undersecretary of State Offers a New Interpretation of the Stimson Doctrine</p>
<p>Former Director of the Bureau of Commerce Wants the Three Northeastern Provinces to be Placed Under Japanese Trusteeship</p>
<p>Current Government Officials Say That the Far East Policy Is Still to be Announced</p>
<p>(Washington) Former U.S. Undersecretary of State Castle gave a speech in Philadelphia tonight, offering a new interpretation of the Stimson Non-Recognition Doctrine, which is known throughout the world. He said that this doctrine does not eliminate the possibility that the United States might recognize "Manchukuo," because when this policy was first announced, it was never stated that the United States would never recognize "Manchukuo." Time may change the situation, and time may also affect the entire issue. He also said that because the situation in the Far East is different from that in the West, the Japanese cannot understand why the United States seems to be hindering their natural expansion. The Japanese want to see the United States as a good friend, but they cannot understand or forget the insult to the Japanese caused by the unnecessary immigration laws of the Americans. Because Castle's speech was given late, it has not been widely spread among officials and members of Congress here, but those who have heard it are deeply surprised, saying that everyone believes that the Stimson Doctrine is specifically applied to Japan's military actions in Manchuria, and they also recall that the State Department, under Stimson's leadership, repeatedly stated this policy regarding the Chaco War between Bolivia and Paraguay in South America. New government officials are unwilling to comment on this speech, only saying that the current government has not yet announced its policy on the Far East. It is noted that Castle once served as a special envoy to Japan. When the U.S. government sent dispatches to China and Japan with the Non-Recognition Doctrine, Castle was the Undersecretary of State, and this dispatch was issued on January 7, 1932. At that time, the State Department, fearing that diplomatic language might be too subtle and cause misunderstandings among the public and newspapers abroad, attached a statement explaining the content of the dispatch. Although this statement was unsigned, it was generally believed to have been written by Castle. It stated: First, we certainly have no intention of questioning Japan's legitimate treaty rights in Manchuria, nor do we have any intention of interfering with such legitimate rights. Second, we have no intention of interfering in any resolution of the current unfortunate dispute between China and Japan, as long as (1) this resolution does not hinder the Open Door Policy and the rights of the United States in China as indicated in the Nine-Power Treaty, and (2) this resolution is not a method that violates the agreements agreed upon in the Kellogg-Briand Pact. (7th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(New York) Former Director of the Far East Division of the U.S. Department of Commerce, Aldrich, claimed today that before the Sino-Japanese dispute can be resolved, there must first be a face-saving plan. He believes that it would be better for the Chinese government to ask the League of Nations to take over Manchuria as a mandated territory, and then have the League of Nations place it under Japanese trusteeship, and order Japan to rejoin the League of Nations. The Japanese should regard Manchuria as a mandated territory and submit reports to the League of Nations on a regular basis, just like the German colonies after the European War were placed under the trusteeship of the great powers. It is noted that Aldrich once served as a translator in the U.S. Embassy in Japan, and later served as Deputy Secretary and Accountant of the Japan Telephone Company. Today's speech was broadcast on the radio by the League of Nations Association. (7th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) The speech by former U.S. Undersecretary of State Castle was given at the American Political University in Philadelphia. The university specifically invited national celebrities to discuss U.S. Far East policy. The speaker following Castle was Sowardski, who once lived in Shanghai. Sowardski claimed that the various revolutionary changes that China has experienced in the past 100 years are the same as those that Europe experienced in the past 500 to 600 years. These changes not only caused confusion among Western people, but also disturbed the Chinese people. Afterwards, there were speeches by former Ambassador to Japan Morly Tu and female writer Mrs. Booker. (7th National Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e31">The Depressing State of Affairs <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>China's internal and external troubles today can be described as extremely dangerous. The state of silence and observation throughout the country can also be described as extremely depressing. At this moment when the nation and people are about to be lost to danger, all people should have the spirit of excitement, vigor, indignation, and desperation to strive for survival. However, there is this depressing phenomenon. On the one hand, the government authorities, although expressing resistance, are not negotiating properly. In fact, how will they ultimately decide on a policy? How will they openly and honestly cooperate with the people to save this national crisis? How will they plan and arrange, and unite with all parties to face this national crisis together? We are all in the dark and have heard nothing. On the other hand, our people are accustomed to complacency and are misled by the fallacy of the dangers of war. Seeing that the government has no definite and clear proposition, and no initiative to encourage courage, they also hesitate to watch and not move forward. Because of these two, today's depressing situation has been formed.</p>
<p>However, this kind of depressing situation cannot be prolonged. The longer the depression, the more doubts and suspicions arise. As a result of suspicion and distrust, rumors are created to incite discord and sow discord. Those who take advantage of it to reap profits from it are born. Furthermore, because of misunderstandings, all kinds of trivial and unexpected problems are also born from this. The party and government authorities suspect that the people are opposed to them, or are dissatisfied with a certain policy and plan to overthrow it, or are dissatisfied with a certain action and plan to resist it. Therefore, they guard against every word and deed of the people, fearing that it will not be strict enough. They keep their own words and deeds secret, fearing that it will not be secretive enough. Can this approach the people? On the side of the people, they suspect that the party and government authorities will never realize the situation, that a certain policy will be implemented, and that a certain oppression will be intensified. Those who worried that the government would not cooperate with the people now worry that the people will not cooperate with the government. As a result of suspicion, the people regard the government as strangers at best, and enemies at worst. Is it not just that they are not close to each other? The disasters of national subjugation and racial extinction in history all started from suspicion between superiors and subordinates, and were formed by an uncertain national policy and a depressing situation. How heartbreaking is this? The so-called national crisis is borne by the people and those who govern the country together. Now, the people and those who govern the country cannot first eliminate suspicion and unite together. How will they face the national crisis together? Therefore, I say that this kind of depressing situation is the most dangerous in the dangerous period of national crisis.</p>
<p>Then how can we break this depressing situation? The premise of a depressing situation lies in the government's lack of a sincere and clear statement. On the one hand, it does not show our people a way to save the country, and on the other hand, it does not declare to our people its sincerity in resisting foreign aggression together. Our people are in this crisis where the country is about to perish. Who has no heart? Who does not want to seek self-rescue urgently? They simply do not know where the true intention of the government lies. Although they have enthusiasm, they have no reliance. Although they want to do their best, they have no way to concentrate their efforts. If the government authorities once resolutely took the lead from above, who would not be willing to rise up and share the responsibility of saving the country? The national situation is so dangerous that we must not hide or shirk responsibility any longer. All perfunctory and delaying measures should not be used. Angry accusations should not be made. The petty tricks of intrigue and opportunism should not be played. Only the government and the people should remove their mutual suspicions, discuss everything openly, and not hide difficult points. Things that should be changed should be changed resolutely. If they can be honest with each other in this way, then if the government really has difficulties, the people will naturally understand. If the people really have good strategies, the government will naturally obey. Uniting together, and then using their full strength to face the national crisis together, who would not be happy to sacrifice? Who would not be willing to risk their lives? This is the first essential to breaking the depressing situation. If this depression continues, the people will look forward to it day by day, but the government's news is absent and its actions are silent. Then, they will be discouraged by suspicion, or they will turn from suspicion to resentment. After extreme depression, it may be followed by a fierce storm. The changes in the depressing situation will not be predictable by us, and how can we bear to say how dangerous it is?</p>

<p>Soviet Russian Workers to Hold a General Strike</p>
<p>(Changchun) The Soviet Russian side transported 3,600 locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars of the Chinese Eastern Railway into Russian territory. "Manchukuo" repeatedly negotiated for their return, but the Russian side refused. On the evening of the 7th, the Manchukuo government ordered officials in Manchuria and other places to prevent the Russian side's actions. On one hand, officials in Harbin issued a warning protest to the Soviet Russian consul. If the Russian side takes action, the relationship between the two sides of Manchuria will take a sharp turn for the worse. Therefore, the Manchukuo government is considering the situation and may resort to force, and has made a decision. Therefore, Moscow's attitude is noteworthy. (8th Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Soviet Russian authorities are very worried about the future security of the Chinese Eastern Railway. It is said that they plan to change it into an international limited organization to complicate the relationship between the Chinese Eastern Railway and various countries as a way to remedy the situation. There is also a saying that there has been considerable progress in negotiations between the United States and Russia on this matter. (8th Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The "Manchukuo" government today officially used force to lock the connection between the Chinese Eastern Railway and the Sava-Baikal Railway. This matter is to prevent the Russian side from transporting freight cars to Russia. However, the Russian side will take retaliatory measures. The Russian workers of the Chinese Eastern Railway will hold a general strike, planning to stop the entire line from operating. (8th Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to news from Manchuria, the dispute between "Manchukuo" and Soviet Russia over Russia's detention of vehicles has now reached an alarming degree. "Manchukuo" officials have stopped traffic on the Chinese Eastern Railway and the Baikal Railway to prevent vehicles from entering Russia again. Therefore, traffic to Siberia has now stopped.

<p>(Nanjing) The Huai River Guidance Association explained that diverting the Yellow River into the Huai River in Henan is not harmful to Anhui. The number of dredging workers on the Zhangfu River has increased to more than 13,000 and will be completed by the end of May. After the Zhangfu River project is completed, the Sanhe movable dam and the Shaobo and Qingjiang ship locks will be built. The completion time depends on the funding. In total, dredging the Zhangfu River, building the Sanhe movable dam, and building the Shaobo and Qingjiang ship locks will cost 8 million yuan. The allocation is as follows: 500,000 yuan for the Zhangfu River dredging project, 3.5 million yuan for the Sanhe movable dam construction project, and 3 million yuan for the Shaobo and Qingjiang ship lock construction project. Currently, because 350,000 yuan has been allocated to the Zhangfu River project from the Gengzi Indemnity, plus the remaining 150,000 yuan from this association, there is no problem completing the Zhangfu River project. To complete the Jiangba and Shaobo and Qingjiang ship locks, another 7.5 million yuan is still needed. This association has applied for 400,000 pounds from the Sino-British Gengzi Indemnity. Currently, the association has hired engineers from the Shanghai Dredging Bureau to review it. The League of Nations also sent Puddeli to China two years ago to assist with the Huai River Guidance Project. Therefore, there should be no problem borrowing the Gengzi Indemnity.

<p>(Nanjing) The Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics and the Ministries of Finance and Auditing continued to hold a meeting on the 8th to promote the 22nd year's budget plan, discussing the category of subsidies. Because of its complex nature, it took a very long time. Among them, some were called subsidies to various provinces to help them with military expenses, but were actually military salaries, such as the subsidies to Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian provinces, most of which belonged to this category. Some were central subsidies to local provinces to help them with military expenses, but the local provinces assisted the central government with huge military expenses, such as the subsidies to Hebei Province and Qingdao City, which belonged to this category. Some were called subsidies, but were actually the agency's own income, and the national treasury did not bear the burden, such as judicial subsidies. In addition, there were many subsidies that the national government had not issued for a long time, which was equivalent to eliminating them. All of these names that did not conform to the facts have been completely investigated and are specifically reported for correction by the central government. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>German Press Reaction to French Premier's Speech</p>
<p>Reuter, Berlin, 7th – Vice-Chancellor Papen left for Rome last night, and Speaker of the Reichstag, Goering, plans to continue by plane on Sunday. The two politicians will have private discussions with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Italian cabinet members on the Four-Power Pact and other issues.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 8th – The full text of France's response to the British and Italian proposals regarding the Four-Power Pact will be submitted to Prime Minister Daladier by Foreign Minister Boncour this afternoon. The French Ambassador to Italy, Jouvenel, is scheduled to depart for Rome tonight to resume his post. Before his departure, he will consult with the Foreign Minister.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 7th – German newspapers have reacted to French Prime Minister Daladier's recent speech in the Chamber of Deputies. The Berliner Tageblatt stated that Daladier's speech showed his opposition to Mussolini's plan. The Vossische Zeitung stated that Daladier rejected the Four-Power Pact proposal. The Germania editorial concluded, "Mussolini's plan is dead." The "Kreuzzeitung" criticized the French parliament, saying it had destroyed the Four-Power Pact plan.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 7th – During the Chamber of Deputies' discussion of foreign policy, right-wing member Puyhume stated that the Four-Power Pact would force the fourth country to recognize the revision of treaties. Radical leader Herriot spoke, saying he fully agreed with Prime Minister Daladier's declaration, but that there was a great difference between the British plan and the Roman plan. The Roman plan is now very different from what it was before the 15th, and France cannot recognize it in its original form. Herriot said the government's attitude was cautious in explaining the connection between the League of Nations covenant and the clauses regarding treaty revision, because it believed that treaty revision required the consent of the people. Therefore, if the people did not agree, revision could not proceed. Herriot believed that in addition to the four major European powers, the United States was also present, and why shouldn't Soviet Russia cooperate? Herriot also believed that treaty revision should be based on two principles: national self-determination and the equality of all countries. He opposed both the conclusion of alliances and isolationist policies. Herriot concluded that the government has always supported the League of Nations and has never changed its attitude towards the principles advocated by France at the Disarmament Conference, which is commendable.</p>

<p>Reuters, Moscow, 8th – The newspaper Izvestia today carried an editorial on the British House of Commons' passage of a bill banning Russian imports, saying that Britain could not intimidate the Russians. It also said that British diplomats disregarded the evidence against the British engineers and deliberately exaggerated the fact that thirty-five Russians were shot without trial the night before the engineers were detained. The British imperialists' intimidation raises suspicions that the British fear that the engineers' trial would expose unspeakable facts. If the British allow such incidents to harm relations between the two countries, the two countries cannot trade normally. Since the economic systems of Britain and Russia are not compatible, such incidents are bound to occur frequently and are not surprising. The newspaper concluded that the Soviet court trying the defendants will rule on the case without hesitation.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Warsaw, 7th – Polish Prime Minister Piłsudski spoke with Soviet Russian Ambassador Osuśky for two hours today. It is reported that they discussed Polish-Russian relations and the Four-Power Pact. It is the first time in nearly five years that Piłsudski has personally consulted with foreign representatives, so political circles here believe this is a sign of amity between Poland and Russia.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Katowice, 8th – Two hundred Polish students waited at the Rybnik train station in Upper Silesia today for the train from here to arrive. They took out German newspapers that they had brought and set them on fire with kerosene, singing the Polish national anthem and forcing passengers and onlookers to sing along. As a result, no German newspapers were delivered to the area near Rybnik in Upper Silesia today.</p>

<p>Washington Conference</p>
<h3 id="e66">President Roosevelt to Announce World Economic Recovery Plan <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>China, France, Italy, Germany, Japan and other countries are invited to participate</p>
<p>Separate discussions will be held, not in the form of a round table conference</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 7th – After the British Prime Minister accepted the American invitation, the United States has invited the leaders of the French, Italian, and German governments to come to Washington to discuss preparations for the World Economic Conference. The invitation was conveyed verbally by the American ambassadors to the three countries. If the government leaders cannot come, other important members of the former government are also welcome. Otherwise, the diplomatic authorities can exchange opinions. Future international talks will be handled separately, not in the form of a round table conference. It is reported that President Roosevelt will do everything in his power to reduce commercial and financial barriers, based roughly on a direct reduction of import tariffs by one-tenth. However, the war debt issue will not be a major topic of discussion, as this issue is only one element of the current situation. In addition to inviting the four major European powers of Britain, France, Italy, and Germany, the United States today also expressed its willingness to discuss the Economic Conference with other relevant countries, in order to prepare everything for the upcoming London Conference and save many weeks of work at the conference.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 7th – It has just been learned that President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull have jointly prepared a plan to revive the world economy, which will be discussed separately with specially appointed representatives from various countries. It is also heard that President Roosevelt does not advocate holding a round table conference at this time, but rather waiting until the World Economic Conference opens before discussing it together.</p>
<p>China and Japan are also among those invited to exchange opinions. Secretary of State Hull verbally invited Chinese Minister Shi Zhaoji today, but it is expected that the two countries will probably not send special envoys to the United States to discuss the matter. In addition, various countries, especially Chile, Brazil, Argentina, etc., will send special representatives to the United States and provide trial plans for reviving world trade.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt's decision to discuss with representatives of various countries separately is in line with his new policy of advocating separate negotiations with various countries on mutual trade agreements. However, it is heard that the American authorities do not intend to discuss these agreements in the initial discussions. The main purpose at this time is only to hear the opinions of the representatives on the trade situation between their countries and the United States. President Roosevelt wants to eliminate all trade barriers, so he wants to gather ideas and listen to proposals from all parties. It is also heard that President Roosevelt is willing to have the United States take the lead in making concessions to eliminate trade barriers, setting an example for various countries.</p>
<p>Furthermore, although the plan drafted by Roosevelt and Hull does not include the issue of revising war debts and intends to discuss it separately, it is anticipated that this matter will not be mentioned when economic issues are discussed. National News Agency, Washington, 7th – Many representatives from various countries to the United States have been authorized by their governments today to discuss the economic recovery plan with the American president, as the State Department has extended verbal invitations to various countries.</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, the plan that the American authorities will propose for discussion is not entirely an American plan. Part of it is based on the facts and recommendations listed in the memorandum of British Ambassador Lindsay. This memorandum was exchanged between Lindsay and Secretary of State Hull several weeks ago in order to study the world economic situation. It is said that President Roosevelt's plan will take into account the current situation in Europe, and it is heard that the United States will make practical contributions to reducing tariffs and disarmament. The proposal to uniformly reduce or increase American tariffs is not enough to prevent the United States from negotiating mutual agreements with various countries in the future.</p>
<p>Tonight, there is much speculation here about how President Roosevelt will separately consult with representatives of various countries. It is said that British Prime Minister MacDonald will be a guest at the White House for initial discussions. In addition, it is anticipated that representatives from various countries will depart one after another and may not come to the United States at the same time. Although French Prime Minister Daladier, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, and German Chancellor Hitler have been invited, it is heard that they will send first-class important figures as representatives because they cannot spare the time.</p>
<p>At this time, there are various rumors about President Roosevelt's plan, but none have been verified. Furthermore, the rumor that the American government will ask Congress for authorization to allow a short-term suspension of war debt payments has also not been verified.</p>
<p>Reuters, Rome, 7th – It is learned that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini originally intended to appoint Italian Ambassador to the United States Rosso as the Italian representative to attend the Washington conference discussing economic matters, as Rosso is an economic expert. However, now that British Prime Minister MacDonald has agreed to go to Washington in person, and other important figures from other countries may also travel to the United States together, it is planned to send a representative with a higher position. It is rumored that Finance Minister Jung has already agreed to Prime Minister's invitation and will visit London to meet with the British Prime Minister. He may now be ordered to go to the United States to participate in the meeting called by President Roosevelt.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 8th – American representative to the Disarmament Conference, Davis, arrived here today and immediately discussed the economic situation and disarmament issues with Foreign Minister Neurath and President Hindenburg.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 8th – President Hindenburg received the chief American representative to the Disarmament Conference, Davis, at 12 noon. Chancellor Hitler will meet with Davis in the evening, and Foreign Minister Neurath will also be present. According to Davis's aides, the trip to Berlin is only to explore information, as Davis wants to take the opportunity to meet with German political leaders to learn to what extent the success of the Economic Conference depends on disarmament and treaty revision.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 7th – American representative to Europe, Davis, will come to Berlin tomorrow to meet with Foreign Minister Neurath. According to plan, German President Hindenburg will personally receive Davis. Davis will spend Sunday in Berlin. The purpose of Davis's visit to Berlin is to invite Germany to send a representative to Washington to participate in preliminary discussions for the World Economic Conference. It is heard that Germany has long decided to accept the invitation, but does not intend to send a special delegation, because Germany's position is slightly different from that of Britain and France. Britain and France fear that they will discuss the debts between the Allied countries again, so Germany may only be represented by the newly appointed Ambassador to the United States, Dr. Luther.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 8th – Foreign Minister Boncour telegraphed former Prime Minister Herriot in Lyon this morning, saying that according to a telegram from the ambassador in Washington, the United States invited France to send representatives to participate in the talks. Prime Minister Daladier has already informed Herriot of this matter, and he can reply when he returns to Paris on the morning of Tuesday.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 8th – President Roosevelt's invitation to Japan to participate in the Washington World Economic Conference talks arrived in Tokyo this morning. It is now learned that the Japanese government will accept the invitation.</p>

<p>Reuters, Washington, 7th – Detroit Mayor Murphy has now been appointed as Governor-General of the Philippines, succeeding former Governor-General Roosevelt, who recently resigned. Murphy is 40 years old and studied at Lincoln School in London and Trinity College in Dublin. In 1916, he practiced law in Detroit. Two years later, he became an assistant to the Wayne County Prosecutor in Michigan. He is currently serving his second term as Mayor of Detroit, which will be completed next year. During the European War, he served as a lieutenant and later rose to captain. After the armistice, he was stationed in Germany with the American army.</p>

<p>Reuters, Berlin, 7th – Chancellor Hitler announced to the public today that the German revolution cost a total of 330 deaths, 40,000 injuries, and 100,000 unemployed in the business community. This is the price of Germany's recovery. Among the listeners were cabinet members, diplomats, and news reporters. The German government is now considering restoring the titles, badges, and medals that were abolished by the Weimar Constitution, and President Hindenburg will award them. The first type of medal will be awarded to those who have made contributions to the national revolution, followed by medals for art and science. A new law was promulgated today, and each state will be appointed an administrator by the central government, who will have complete control over the state's cabinet. The administrators are subject to Hitler's control. Hitler himself is already the administrator of the state of Prussia, and it is expected that Vice-Chancellor Papen or Speaker of the Reichstag Goering will be the Prime Minister of Prussia. The new law makes state elections no longer necessary.</p>

<h3 id="e70">Saito Still in Difficulties <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 8th – The issue of whether Justice Minister Oyama will remain in office and its impact on the political situation are being given great importance by all parties. The government considered the issue of Justice Minister Oyama's resignation to be a source of unease within the cabinet. Now that it has been resolved, Prime Minister Saito's plan to extend the cabinet's life can proceed unhindered. However, there is still a major outstanding issue, namely the issue of Finance Minister Takahashi's resignation, which has not been resolved. Therefore, the unease in the cabinet remains. Although Prime Minister Saito tried hard to persuade the Finance Minister to stay after visiting Duke Kido on his way back from visiting the Grand Shrine, the Finance Minister's determination to resign is even stronger today, respecting his old feud with President Suzuki. He will definitely submit his formal resignation to Prime Minister Saito within the next few days. On the other hand, if Prime Minister Saito has no hope of preventing the Finance Minister's formal resignation, he plans to replace him. However, it is feared that the cabinet reshuffle cannot proceed as easily as the Prime Minister intends. Moreover, since the Army Minister and the Seiyukai-affiliated cabinet members have already expressed their absolute opposition to replacing the Finance Minister, if the Finance Minister does resign, it will be difficult for the current cabinet to clean up the situation. It is expected that at this time, the Saito cabinet will still have to resign en masse.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 8th – The Kokumin Domei attaches great importance to Prime Minister Saito's attempt to persuade Justice Minister Oyama to stay in office and petition for an imperial order to be issued. It issued the following statement today, impeaching Prime Minister Saito, saying that the Justice Minister has decided to resign, but Prime Minister Saito believes that this is not necessary and petitioned for the issuance of an imperial order, which is an unscrupulous act of evading responsibility and cannot be tolerated.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 8th – Education Minister Hatoyama visited Seiyukai President Suzuki at his private residence at 2:00 PM yesterday to report on the events surrounding Justice Minister Oyama's resignation. At the same time, he had a frank discussion about his own position. He visited again at 9:00 PM to discuss everything, and they unanimously agreed that since the red scare issue under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice has led to the Justice Minister's resignation being withdrawn, the same issue of responsibility under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education, Hatoyama, is naturally also affected. Therefore, Hatoyama's solo resignation at this time is a useless act. As a result, it was decided that the current cabinet would have to resign en masse by May, so the Seiyukai will not take any active action at this time and will temporarily exercise self-restraint and observe the development of the political situation.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 8th – Regarding the issue of Justice Minister Oyama's resignation, the Seiyukai issued the following statement: It is natural for the Justice Minister to submit his resignation, but Prime Minister Saito actually petitioned for it to be withdrawn during the imperial audience. Some are proclaiming the current cabinet's determination to be solid and cling to power, but in our view, the current cabinet has completed its mission and is on the path of retreat.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 8th – The issue of Justice Minister Oyama's retention has also been met with silence within the cabinet, avoiding all discussion. On the surface, it seems to have come to an end, but it is worth noting that the undercurrents in the political world will take the opportunity to surface. The total retreat of the Saito cabinet due to the issue of the Justice Minister has been brought forward as a result, and the political world is already paying attention to how the next cabinet will be formed. As for the issue of the next cabinet, there are various movements, such as the movement to expect another imperial order to be issued to Prime Minister Saito, the movement to restore constitutional government with Seiyukai President Suzuki as the target, and the powerful cabinet movement led by Baron Hiranuma. Those who support Prime Minister Saito are the Minseito party, including Takio Izawa. Mr. Izawa knew about the issue of Justice Minister Oyama's retention and traveled to Kansai, using harsh methods, as if he had a plan in advance.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 8th – Upon returning to Tokyo from Ito, Izu, Minseito President Wakatsuki exchanged views with Secretary-General Matsuda on the current situation. As a result, the Minseito is on alert against all schemes at this time and will maintain the current cabinet throughout.</p>

The naval authorities originally planned to send Macon or Akron to the Sunnyvale base in California. Now that Akron has been lost, it is expected that Macon will remain on the Atlantic coast for the time being.</p>
<h3 id="e73">The Final Reckoning of the American Economic Panic (New York Correspondence) <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>The American labor movement's reformist news agency, Federated Press, recently published a brief and concise statistic on the American economic situation in recent years, stating that since 1928, the United States has been in the extreme economic bankruptcy of modern history. Many large industrial sectors have actually ceased to exist. Even those that are fortunately still able to maintain themselves have seen their production volume fall by 80% to 90%. Some industries, such as the steel industry, could reach zero within a year under the current situation. If the current situation continues for another two or three years, the entire American industry will reach a dead end. According to its statistics, the total amount of wages, salaries, and retail business turnover in the four years is as follows:</p>
<p>Total Wages and Salaries Total Retail Business</p>
<p>USD USD</p>
<p>1929 丨 53 billion 50 billion</p>
<p>1930 丨 45 billion 44 billion</p>
<p>1931 丨 37 billion 37 billion</p>
<p>1932 丨 28 billion 28 billion</p>
<p>Farmers' income has fallen even more severely. The situation is as follows:</p>
<p>1929 丨 12 billion USD</p>
<p>1932 丨 5.5 billion USD</p>
<p>If we do not use currency, but use tonnage to express the value of American basic industries, it is even more obvious. For example, the steel industry production volume in the above four years was 40 丨 30 丨 20 丨 10, which means that it will be zero in one year. The actual production volume is as follows:</p>
<p>1929 丨 39,100,000 tons</p>
<p>1930 丨 28,900,000 tons</p>
<p>1931 丨 18,000,000 tons</p>
<p>1932 丨 9,500,000 tons</p>
<p>The decline in the new housing construction industry is as follows:</p>
<p>1928 丨 2.8 billion USD</p>
<p>1929 丨 1.4 billion USD</p>
<p>1930 丨 1.1 billion USD</p>
<p>1931 丨 800 million USD</p>
<p>1932 丨 300 million USD</p>
<p>If calculated by the value of building permits issued, the average monthly number in the four years is as follows:</p>
<p>1928 丨 55.3 million USD</p>
<p>1929 丨 48.1 million USD</p>
<p>1930 丨 37.7 million USD</p>
<p>1931 丨 25.8 million USD</p>
<p>1932 丨 11.5 million USD</p>
<p>Judging from the decline in 1932, the housing construction industry may be completely suspended around July 7, 1933. By September 17, all construction projects may be completely suspended. The state of Illinois has already reached this point. The issuance of building permits has fallen by 98%. Some construction projects, such as new housing construction in Chicago, have already been completely suspended.</p>
<p>Many railway companies are expected to go bankrupt in 1933. This will be completely confirmed by the amount of railway net income. The average monthly income in the past four years is as follows:</p>
<p>1929 丨 106 million USD</p>
<p>1930 丨 74 million USD</p>
<p>1931 丨 44 million USD</p>
<p>1932 丨 27 million USD</p>
<p>These numbers tell us that if the decline continues like this, it is feared that it will reach the end next year. According to the Labour Research Association, the number of unemployed people in the United States in November 1932 was 16,774,000, while according to the industrial trade journal Industrial Week, it was 15,200,000, which accounts for 42% of the total number of independent workers in the United States. The number of unemployed people in various sectors is as follows:</p>
<p>Agriculture 丨丨丨丨丨 1,283,000 people</p>
<p>Logging, Fishing, and Hunting 丨 137,000 people</p>
<p>Mining 丨丨丨丨丨 392,000 people</p>
<p>Construction 丨丨丨丨 1,943,000 people</p>
<p>Other Industrial Sectors 丨 5,005,000 people</p>
<p>Railway Transportation 丨 667,000 people</p>
<p>Other Various Transportation (including Postal and Telecommunications) 丨 842,000 people</p>
<p>Commerce 丨丨丨丨丨 1,100,000 people</p>
<p>Administrative Officials 丨 133,000 people</p>

<h3 id="e74">The First Act After the Restoration of Diplomatic Relations Between China and Russia <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Ambassador Yan Arrives in Moscow from Geneva</p>
<p>Soviet Russia Temporarily Does Not Join the Advisory Committee</p>
<p>A Retrospective Look at the Sino-Soviet Conference and Its Results</p>
<p>Moscow Correspondence: Our country's ambassador to the Soviet Union, Yan Huiqing, arrived in Russia on March 5th, and Bogomolov is scheduled to depart for China on March 22nd. The exchange of ambassadors after the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Russia has been realized, and the only thing left is to conclude a treaty.</p>
<p>After the special meeting of the League of Nations passed the report, Yan believed that the center of the situation would shift from the West to the East. On the afternoon of March 1st, he departed from Geneva for Moscow, accompanied by First Secretary Wei Liangsheng and Third Secretary Huang Wenping. They visited Mo Dehui, the plenipotentiary representative of the Sino-Soviet Conference in Berlin, to discuss the previous negotiations and the handover procedures this time. On the afternoon of March 4th, they arrived at the Russian border via Poland, at the Niegoroloje customs, which had already been notified by its government, and the luggage was completely exempted from inspection.</p>
<p>On the morning of March 5th, they arrived in Moscow. The People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs sent Florinski, the director of the Protocol Department, to greet them. Yan considered the representative office's building to be too narrow, so he temporarily used the Savoyy Hotel as his office. Wang Zengsi, a specialist commissioner of the Sino-Soviet Conference delegation, hosted a banquet that night on behalf of Mo Dehui to welcome Yan. Bogomolov was also present. This was the first meeting of the two ambassadors. During the banquet, they talked at length about Sino-Russian transportation, trade, and other issues, and the atmosphere was very harmonious. Bogomolov is well-versed in the world's economic trends. It is said that the Soviet Union's wise choice of this person was also due to the failure of its previous policies in China, and that it is changing its course and will focus on promoting Sino-Russian trade in the future, which seems to be reasonable.</p>
<p>Yan presented his credentials on March 9th, recalling that he had personally participated in both the severance of diplomatic relations with Imperial Russia thirteen years ago and the restoration of diplomatic relations with Soviet Russia today, which is a memorable fact. China and Russia are adjacent to each other, and their geographical, historical, and even political relations are close and inseparable. The first country to sign an equal treaty with China was also Soviet Russia. The political transformation of Russia and the transition of the New Economic Policy from ideal to reality have achieved obvious results, which have been widely recognized by the world. Among them, the most exciting thing is China, because China is also on the road to construction. Kalinin, chairman of the Central Executive Committee, replied that the Soviet Union's policy towards China has been detailed in the declarations of 1919 and 1920, and that it will continue this spirit in the future, hoping that the friendship between China and its neighboring countries will become closer day by day. Ambassador Yan's contribution to the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries is worthy of praise. Kalinin also talked with Yan privately about the Manchurian issue, saying that this could promote the self-awareness of the Chinese nation, but that a satisfactory solution would ultimately depend on its own struggle. It is reported that the Soviet Union has expressed its intention to temporarily not participate in the advisory committee of the League of Nations. On March 7th, Litvinov, the chairman of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, officially replied to League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond by letter. The Soviet Union does not trust the League of Nations, and is also dissatisfied with the recommendations in the report. Moreover, the Soviet Union still has major interests in the hands of the Japanese, so it does not want its actions to be bound by the League of Nations. The original Russian letter is attached below with translation:</p>
<p>The Soviet government has thoroughly discussed the proposals in your Secretary-General's letters of February 24th and 25th, and has carefully studied the various documents attached to them. As a result, it believes that the League of Nations resolution and the report of the Committee of Nineteen are based on the Covenant of the League of Nations, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The Soviet Union has only signed the Kellogg-Briand Pact among the above-mentioned treaties, and has not joined the former two. Since its founding, the Soviet Union has declared that all nations have the right to self-determination, can express themselves freely, and should not be subject to any external pressure, and resolutely opposes the results of armed conquest and violent occupation such as territorial cession and indemnities. This is the basic principle of its policy. According to this principle, it must absolutely respect the inviolability of the territory of all countries, and the political, economic, and administrative independence. It is not allowed to use any other methods to resolve international conflicts except peaceful methods. As for the various international treaties that contain the above-mentioned principles, it should bear a serious obligation to abide by them.</p>
<p>The Soviet government's proposal for general and complete disarmament aims to make it impossible for countries that do not recognize this principle to undermine this principle. At the recent disarmament conference, the Soviet representative proposed that sanctions should be applied to various pretexts that are often used to defend violations of international peace treaties and acts of violent occupation. The Kellogg-Briand Pact and other similar international treaties only contain the above-mentioned principles and a part of the Soviet proposals. The basis of the League of Nations' resolution on the Sino-Japanese conflict is similar to the principles of the Soviet Union's peace policy, so it is in agreement with the Soviet Union's views.</p>
<p>However, in the report of the Committee of Nineteen adopted by the League of Nations Assembly, the head of this department believes that the suggestions for the Sino-Japanese conflict and the application of the League of Nations resolution have deviated from the above-mentioned basis on several very serious issues, and cannot coexist with it. In this spirit, the advisory committee established by the Assembly is an organ of the League of Nations, and one of its purposes is to promote the Assembly's fulfillment of its obligations. This organ should also make suggestions to the Assembly. Since the Soviet Union is not a member of the League of Nations, it has no way to influence the Assembly's decisions.</p>
<p>The purpose of the advisory committee should be to promote the consistency of actions between member states and non-member states. However, among the 22 countries that joined the committee, 13 countries do not have any formal relations with the Soviet Union. More than half of the countries have a hostile attitude towards the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union cannot negotiate with more than half of the representatives, nor can it negotiate separately with countries that share common interests. It is questionable whether the committee can take consistent action with the Soviet Union. It is even more doubtful whether these countries can truly take into account the interests of the Soviet Union in the recommendations. Due to the above-mentioned circumstances, the Soviet government believes that it cannot express its agreement with the League of Nations' resolution, and that it cannot join the advisory committee at this time.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the Sino-Japanese conflict, the Soviet government has been willing to do everything in its power to prevent the continued development of armed conflict, so as not to evolve into a new source of world conflagration, and has adopted a path of strict neutrality. In this spirit, the Soviet government sincerely implements its peace policy, and will always adopt and implement actions for any international organization or the government of a single country that attempts to resolve conflicts quickly and fairly and safeguard peace in the Far East.</p>
<p>The Chinese ambassador to Russia was originally Sun Baoqi, but he has not yet taken office. Therefore, the ambassador stationed abroad was actually started by Yan. In addition to the embassies of England, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, Persia, Turkey, and Afghanistan, there is now a Chinese embassy in Moscow. In Soviet Russia, all houses are owned by the state. Although the building of the Chinese embassy is designated by the government, and it is stated that the rent is 30,000 rubles per year, there are many residents in the house, and it will take time to relocate them and repair it. It is feared that it will not be officially established until two or three months later.</p>
<p>Karakhan, the deputy chairman of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, hosted a banquet for Ambassador Yan and all the staff of the embassy at the Diplomatic Guesthouse on March 13th. Karakhan was the first Soviet ambassador to China, and is now responsible for dealing with the Manchurian issue. Yan also hosted a farewell banquet for Bogomolov and Wang Zengsi, a specialist commissioner of the Sino-Soviet Conference delegation, on March 15th. Also present were Barnoff, the counselor of the Soviet embassy, Borovoy, the second secretary, Melnikovski, the deputy consul in Shanghai, Sabanine, the director of the Treaty Department of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, Kozlsovki, the director of the Far East Department, and Krisonfoff, the secretary-general. Wu Nanru, the counselor of the embassy who came here from China, Xue Yong, the second secretary, and Liu Xizhang, an attendant, also participated.</p>
<p>The establishment of the embassy means the end of the delegation. Since the signing of the Khabarovsk Agreement, it has been no different from a treaty concluded under duress. Although China has the February 8th Declaration, the Soviet Union turned a deaf ear to it. A big mistake has been made, and the crisis is imminent. Mo Dehui was ordered to take office in a hurry, and arrived in Moscow on May 9th of the 19th year of the Republic of China. However, due to the issue of authority, a twist suddenly occurred. The Chinese side only ordered Mo to discuss the issue of the Chinese Eastern Railway, while the Russian side insisted that it should also involve the restoration of diplomatic relations and trade. After a long period of verbal disputes, the authority was expanded. Therefore, the Sino-Soviet Conference officially opened on October 11th. The Russian side first asked whether China recognized the Khabarovsk record. The Chinese side aimed to "answer ambiguously and try to avoid it." The discussion lasted for three hours, and ended without results. Karakhan said that this issue would still need to be discussed at the next meeting. Did the conference not become a stalemate at this point? Fortunately, Zhang Xueliang and Gu Weijun asked the Russian consul in Yangxiang to intercede, and they finally obtained the understanding of the Russian side and temporarily did not mention it. Therefore, the conference was reopened on December 4th, and divided into three committees: the Chinese Eastern Railway, the restoration of diplomatic relations, and trade, to engage in technical research. However, when discussing the outline, the Chinese side secretly preserved the February 8th Declaration and insisted that it would not discuss the latter two until the former was resolved. This was not acceptable to the Russian side. Mo had no way to proceed, so he returned to China on December 21st to ask for instructions, first to Beiping and then to Nanjing. As a result, it was agreed to discuss the three at the same time. On March 28th of the 20th year of the Republic of China, Mo arrived in Moscow again, and the conference was reopened on April 12th. Who knew that the issue of the Chinese Eastern Railway could not be resolved due to mutual contention between joint management and redemption. After the September 18th Incident, the Russian side had no intention of negotiating. Mo felt that his old illness had recurred, so he went to Berlin on March 19th of the 21st year of the Republic of China to recuperate. In Moscow, Wang Zengsi, a specialist commissioner, acted on his behalf until now. Now the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ordered that the seal be sent to Beijing for cancellation, and the documents and furniture will be transferred to the embassy. Wang said that the procedures were clear, and on March 15th, he and Cai Yunchen, the secretary-general of the Chinese Eastern Railway Administration, returned to China via Vladivostok. As for Mo, he has a history of seasickness and is inconvenient for sea travel. It is said that he will wait for his wife to recover from her illness and then return to China via Xinjiang in May. I have traced the matter so that it can be used as a reference for future treaty negotiations. (Central News Agency, March 16th)</p>
<h3 id="e75">Japan's Preparation for Total War (Continued 4) <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>12. Manchurian Resources</p>
<p>In terms of the resources of Manchuria, they are actually very great. With ten years of management, it can become as wealthy a country as the United States. Indeed, in the interior, there is a danger of bandits jumping over the beam, and it is impossible to conduct investigations. On the other hand, because politicians have to pay taxes and other related matters, they do not truthfully report the actual situation of resources. Ordinary people who travel to Manchuria only get a glimpse from the train window, or hear the pessimistic words of unemployed people in Manchuria in the reception room of a hotel. However, if you ask the parties involved who are familiar with the actual situation, you can understand that Manchuria is very rich, and it may even become a richer country than the United States.</p>
<p>In short, there will be no problems in terms of military resources and food. The aluminum problem that is currently raging is also abundant in Manchuria and Korea. This kind of industry is currently being started in Manchuria and at home, so there will definitely be considerable production in a year or two. Now aluminum ore has also been discovered in the Natsume area of Hyogo Prefecture. The person who discovered it is called Anan, and it has been decided to smelt it there. In the future, aluminum sundries will also be produced. Moreover, substitutes can also be used quite appropriately. Metals such as manganese that are currently imported from foreign countries can be extracted from Manchuria if it is developed. The problem that arises is the oil problem. The next problem is rubber. If rubber cannot be imported at all, it will be a bit difficult. However, substitutes can also be used. For example, Germany had no rubber at all in five years, but it was able to continue the war.</p>
<p>13. Invention is a Victory in Economic Warfare: Scholars often engage in the cause of discovery or invention. Modern warfare is expressed in various forms such as force, economy, thought, diplomacy, internal affairs, and cultivation. Therefore, in the economic war, we must discover substitutes for oil. In other words, substitutes for oil can be said to be the victory of the economic war. We can greatly advocate the invention of the victory of economic war.</p>
<p>The research on inventions is also an effort that cannot be made greatly. The entire strength of the nation must be used to research and invent towards the goals stipulated by the country. It is more meaningful to strive to invent more refined things that can already be self-sufficient in the country than to strive to invent things that cannot be obtained in the country. Regarding this level, the government is currently proceeding, and there will definitely be considerable achievements discovered in the near future.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the total mobilization plan, the human element has become a very important issue. In terms of industry alone, it is not a problem to allocate workers or technicians properly and control them appropriately. However, in the same industry, there are also industries that naturally tend to decline during wartime, and on the contrary, there are also industries that are extremely inflated for a while. It is impossible to reconcile the staff or workers of the declining industries and the inflated industries with each other. For example, it is impossible to transfer most of the people engaged in the fiber industry to the heavy industry. Perhaps a part can be transferred, but the total mobilization plan for personnel is very difficult. This phenomenon will inevitably occur once the war begins. As a result, a large number of unemployed people will inevitably be produced. How to dispose of these unemployed people must also be greatly considered. The problem of skilled workers is also an extremely difficult problem to solve. The existence or absence of skilled workers can affect the efficiency of the industry, especially for important industries that must be extremely inflated during wartime, skilled workers should be cultivated from peacetime.</p>
<p>The United States is conducting factory equipment in a very novel way, and seems to be studying industrial mobilization very vigorously, and is also proceeding quite a bit in terms of implementation. For example, the United States divides its own land into fourteen ordnance districts, and places a powerful entrepreneur in each district, called the district chief. The government relies on this person to contact the manufacturers. This district chief usually orders a part of military supplies from a certain factory, and also handles the planning of industrial mobilization within a district. This plan must first conduct an investigation, then handle the planning of ordering objects, make a production plan and a raw material plan, and also study rubber and manganese substitutes. Other matters concerning the unity of the plan, the control of power, the transportation plan, and labor must all be considered and investigated for each factory. These are the tasks of the district chief. Because the Japanese army has always had very little budget, the army's weapons are all manufactured in the arsenal. Apart from airplanes, only a few items such as machine guns are manufactured in the private sector. However, since the Manchurian Incident, due to the increase in the budget for military supplies, there are many that have been manufactured in the private sector recently. In the 62nd session of the Diet last year, the army obtained 18.5 million yen for the budget for rescuing the situation, of which the pure military supplies budget excluding construction costs was 13 million yen. How to use this budget, to give an example, there are two hundred private factories that are directly stipulated by the army agencies of the arsenal, the armament headquarters, and the aviation headquarters. Under these two hundred factories, each factory has an average of ten factories to help manufacture, so the number of factories working under 13 million yen is 2,000, and the number of workers working in them is about 3 million. Since the incident, skilled workers, except for special accidents, have not lost a single job. The situation seen in Kokura now is that thirty checkerboard workers had to be recruited a month ago, but no one applied. This means that there are no unemployed people. All the people who used to be engaged in military industry work and are now unemployed have been completely rescued and reinstated. Although there are quite a few unemployed people in the country, these are definitely not the unemployed people in military factories, but people who have never been employed. Thus, Japan is now greatly utilizing private factories. This should be mentioned in passing after explaining the situation in the United States. (The End)</p>

<p>A Monastery from the Reign of Emperor Renzong</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Ling County, in the northern part of Shandong Province, is a remote and small county. Last month, a farmer was digging soil under an earthen mound in an open space north of the county government, and discovered Song Dynasty buildings. After consultation by various agencies, they jointly excavated at 9:00 on the 30th. A brick-built door facing south, the bricks weighing about fourteen or five catties, and the square bricks weighing about twenty odd catties. The door was six feet high, and inside the door was a pavilion, which was circular and painted with patterns, with red and yellow spots visible. Outside there was a corridor, and people could walk in the lane. The top and bottom were made of large square bricks. A stone box was placed in the pavilion, about three feet long and one foot high. When the lid was opened, there was a monk's hat inside, with more than a dozen silver Buddha statues attached to it. The statues were about two inches high, hollow and very thin, and would break if moved slightly when lifted out. Two or three circular copper plaques were dug out from the side of the box, the larger ones with an area of about two feet. They were covered with green and red rust, and each had a small nose on the back. There were also a dozen or twenty copper coins, engraved with characters such as Kaiyuan Tongbao (Tang Emperor Minghuang) or Xiangfu Yuanbao (Song Emperor Zhenzong). The outside was lined with fine sand and gravel. The next day, a square stone was excavated, as large as a tabletop, with several lines of characters engraved on it, which read, "We, the Great Song Kingdom, Dezhou Qianming Temple, lecture on scriptures and discuss precepts, set up the Tripitaka, repair the scripture collection, the monk Yunshan is the head, transform and create golden coffins and silver outer coffins for burial, transmit scriptures in the hand furnace, courageously produce responsive relics, and erect a stone small master Zhidu." The rest below were all monk stones. When this stone record was excavated, according to a group of people's speculation, there might be gold coffins, silver outer coffins, and scripture collection objects hidden below. The workers were ordered to dig deep, and several layers of bricks were dug up. The ground was dug to the spring, and there were no strange objects. The content was quite large in scale, all made of rectangular large bricks, and the project was extremely strong. Nothing else was seen. It is said that the site was the old site of the White Pagoda Temple. On the lid of the stone box, there were the characters "The Third Year of Huangyou of the Great Song Kingdom." Checking Huangyou, it was the reign of Emperor Renzong of the Song Dynasty, and it has been eight hundred and ninety-six years since then.</p>

<p>Long-Distance Buses Also Sell Tickets and Carry Passengers</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The National Economic Commission believes that the Jingwu Highway is extremely important because it is related to military transportation, and it is also very closely related to the commercial travel of southern Anhui. It assisted the Anhui Provincial Department of Construction in rushing to build it day and night. It is estimated that the entire road from Wuhu to Nanjing is 89 kilometers long, of which 35 kilometers belong to the Jiangsu border of Jingfang, and 54 kilometers belong to the Anhui border of Wufang. The roadbed has long been completed, and the stone road surface has also been completed within the limited time of the end of April. Wu Xingzhou, Li Dachu, and others in the Wuhu business community raised 100,000 yuan to organize the Jingwu Road Long-Distance Bus Company, intending to operate 15 passenger and freight vehicles to run on the road, transporting goods and carrying passengers. They applied to the construction departments of Jiangsu and Anhui provinces for approval to undertake the operation. After Anhui Province approved it, Jiangsu Province did not make a decision until recently when the Jiangsu authorities replied that they would run it officially themselves. The Wuhu businessmen initially planned to set up general stations in both Nanjing and Wuhu, and branch stations along the way in Tongjin, Jiangning, Banqiao, Cihu, Caishi, Dangtu, Daqiao, and other places, directly transporting, and could reach the destination in two and a half hours. Now, because Jiangsu Province insists on official operation, the previous plan cannot be realized. Therefore, it has been decided to set up the Jingwu Road West Section Long-Distance Bus Company. Currently, it only runs from Wuhu to Dangtu, but in order to facilitate travel, several small passenger cars have been specially prepared, and a transit permit has been obtained from five provinces and cities, and they will directly open to Jingwu. After active preparations, the opening ceremony was held on the 6th. At 2:00 noon, the directors arrived at the station to hold the opening ceremony. It was decided to start selling tickets and carrying passengers from the 7th. As for the section in Jiangsu, it is heard that the Jiangsu Construction Department has appointed Tao Tianxing as the director and purchased five cars, and perhaps they can be operated jointly in the future.

<p>Pan Xiangfang (aka Pan Xiaoheshang), who lives in Changsheng Lane, Datiebang, Shanghai, had a passionate affair with Wang Jiangshi, the wife of Wang Guisheng at No. 18 Runde Lane, Huanghe Road. On the night of February 5th, 18th year of the Republic of China, he snuck into Wang's house, hid under the bed, and waited until Wang Guisheng returned in the middle of the night and fell asleep with his wife. He went out and gathered his friend Xia Yunqing (aka Xia Xiaobazi) to cover up, Pan rode on Wang's body, ordered Xia to strangle Wang's throat with a belt, and Wang Jiangshi helped hold Wang Guisheng's feet, and together they murdered Wang. Later, the landlord Hu Lvshi reported to the police station, and the adulterer Pan Xiangfang and the adulteress Wang Jiangshi were arrested and sent to the Shanghai Local Court, sentenced to death, and appealed to the Jiangsu High Court, which still upheld the original judgment. Yesterday (8th) morning at 8:00, under the supervision of Prosecutor Shen Bingqian, they were hanged together at the execution ground of the Third Branch Prison in Siqian Street.</p>

<p>In the past year, notorious bandits such as Taibao Ashu, Zhuluo Amei, etc., joined gangs to rob and cause trouble in the area bordering Song and Jin, and the local area was in turmoil. Cao Pang, the second regiment leader of the Provincial Security Team, and the water police once led the suppression, and the ringleaders were executed one after another. The people of Su Qing's bandit den began to live in peace. Among them, a fugitive named Jin Fei was also a distinguished member of Taibao Ashu's men at that time. He was cunning and has not been arrested. Last month, he sneaked into Songjiang and was arrested for smoking opium in a certain opium den in Black Fish Lane. He was sent to the county court for sentencing. He changed his name to Jin Sipeng, hoping to hide his identity, but he was spotted by a Jinshan native who reported it to the Jinshan County Government and requested that he be brought in for questioning. Now that Jin's sentence for opium smoking is about to expire, the Jinshan County Government has been notified to send someone to Songjiang to welcome and bring him back to be punished according to law.</p>

First, they tied up the victim, Gong Guanfu, his mother, Gu, and his nephew, Agen, and stabbed them with bayonets and burned them with洋燭(foreign candles), forcing them to reveal the hidden silver. Then they wantonly searched and robbed them, losing two gold rings, a gold bracelet, a pearl flower, two gold ear picks, and seven silver yuan, worth about 500 yuan in total.</p>

<p>The preparatory office of the county's Land Bureau began its work in July of last year. After preparing until now, it has a clue. Recently, after the provincial Land Bureau's survey team arrived in the county, it rushed to the Longtan Township area of the Sixth District of the county on the 1st of this month to conduct surveying and measuring. The township has more than 10,000 mu of land, and it is estimated that it can be measured in one month. However, the county has as many as 700,000 mu of farmland (including salt fields), and it will take at least three years to complete all of it. Wuxi</p>

<p>In this county, the conscription of labor for river dredging, ordered by the authorities, is proceeding with extraordinary enthusiasm in all districts. Zhigang Lake in the 17th district (Fu'an Township) was also ordered to be dredged. A dam has already been built to drain the water. Work commenced on the Zhangshe Town section on the 7th. Hua Sigu, the district head, designated residents from Zhangshe Town and the neighboring Lian'gan and Shengdian Townships to participate in the compulsory labor. On that day, a total of five to six hundred people were conscripted. However, after the work began, the laborers were provided with no tea or water throughout the day, causing widespread resentment. They then piled the dredged river mud arbitrarily on the streets of Zhangshe Town, accumulating it so high in front of the gates of the 14th Sub-Bureau of Public Security, the 17th District Office, the Chamber of Commerce branch, and other institutions that the doors could not be opened. Shops in the town, unable to conduct business due to the impassable streets, closed their doors one after another, effectively shutting down the entire town. Around noon, Shen Caiyi, a technician dispatched by the county government to supervise the work, arrived at the scene and immediately began to offer guidance. However, the workers, still seething with anger, molded the mud into clumps and hurled them at Shen. This sparked a chain reaction, and mud clumps, bricks, and stones rained down on him. The workers then surrounded and assaulted Shen with fists and feet. Fortunately, Yang Yu, the head of Lian'gan Township, witnessing the impending disaster, rushed into the crowd and rescued Shen, sending him to the city for medical treatment. His injuries were severe. After the incident, District Head Hua telegraphed County Magistrate Chen, requesting the dispatch of a police force to the township to quell the unrest. County Magistrate Chen, after receiving the report, and out of consideration for the ignorance of the villagers, instructed District Head Hua to persuade them to continue working, warning that any further disturbances would be dealt with severely.</p>

<p>The Zhenjiang Money Trade Association held an emergency meeting yesterday, deciding to abolish the "27 Treasure" system on May 1st. From today onwards, the regulated yuan will be quoted in Shanghai exchange rates for forward delivery, and silver dollars will be quoted in Hankou exchange rates for forward delivery. Although the "27 Treasure" will still exist before May 1st, there will be no changes in the market price. As for the market price of small silver coins, which was previously determined by small traders, the association had a proposal yesterday to add a small silver coin quotation based on the Shanghai method of converting small silver coins into large silver dollars, effective immediately. However, due to the request of small traders, it was decided to open the market on May 1st.</p>

<h3 id="e87">Change of County Magistrate <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Yangzhong County Magistrate Bi Jingqian, from the beginning of his term in July of the 20th year [of the Republic], immediately encountered a major flood disaster. He raised donations for disaster relief and saved countless lives. Moreover, he was known for his integrity, love for the people, and diligence in administration. Therefore, the local gentry and the general public sincerely loved and respected him. Recently, he received an order from the province to be transferred to Liyang. The local gentry and people all wanted to retain him, but due to the order, they were unable to do so. Upon hearing that his replacement was scheduled to take office soon, various party and government agencies, legal entities, local gentry, district and town heads took turns hosting farewell banquets until he handed over the seal on the 5th and departed on the 6th. On that day, no fewer than ten thousand people came to see him off, making it a grand occasion.</p>

<p>The 13th detachment of the 3rd district of the Huzhou Water Police, stationed in Wuzhen, learned the day before yesterday that several bandits were hiding in Hongfu Lane outside the South Gate of the town. The detachment immediately dispatched Patrol Leader Wang, leading more than ten patrol officers, to investigate. They arrested five bandits on the spot: Shen A'er, Xiang A'er (also known as Zhu Guifu), Wang Guiliang, Xu A'san, and Zhang A'wu. They also seized two shotguns and two stolen cotton quilts. The team leader, Tao, interrogated them, and the bandits Shen A'er and others confessed to the robberies at Antongbang, Mapiqiao, and Tunxu. They also confessed that they had hidden stolen goods such as clothing and cotton quilts at the home of Xu A'san's wife outside the East Gate. Based on the information, Team Leader Tao sent detectives to the address, retrieved the stolen goods, and brought Xu A'san's wife, Xu Xu Shi, into custody for questioning. After investigation, it was confirmed that Xu Xu Shi had been threatened by the bandits and was thus innocent and released. The remaining five, Shen A'er and others, along with the two shotguns, were escorted to the Wuxing Court yesterday for further investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Resolution of the Native Silkworm Seed Uproar <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Farmers in Yuhang and Lin'an counties, opposing the Construction Department's forced breeding of improved silkworm seeds and the ban on native silkworm seeds, staged a riot. Subsequently, Zhang Fancun, a section chief from the Construction Department, was sent to Yuhang to persuade them. However, Zhang drove his car into kneeling and pleading farmers, injuring several. The farmers, feeling that their petition was ineffective, triggered a county-wide silkworm farmer riot. For days, over ten thousand people gathered, burning down the prohibition offices and breeding grounds. Shops were completely closed. Various legal entities, seeing the escalating situation spreading to the northwestern townships, sent representatives to the provincial capital to petition. The provincial government, upon receiving the report, fearing the unrest would spread to other counties, decided to temporarily suspend the prohibition of native silkworm seeds and allow their sale to maintain the livelihoods of tens of thousands of farmers. They also dispatched Secretary Li Yu to announce and persuade them. Li arrived in Yuhang on the 7th and, together with County Magistrate Feng Sifan, convened public associations and gentry to announce the provincial government's intentions and persuade all shops in the county to reopen. After the meeting, representatives from various legal entities went to the villages to persuade the farmers. By 7 PM, the unrest gradually subsided. Li returned to the provincial government today (the 8th) to report to the provincial government.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Record of the Second Annual Meeting of the Chinese Astronomical Society <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Chen Fanyu and Zhu Guangcai Give Lectures</p>
<p>Discussion of Motions and Election of Officers</p>
<p>The first day of the Chinese Astronomical Society's meeting has been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the Society continued its meeting in the auditorium of the Academia Sinica on the morning of the 7th, with Vice President Gao Lu presiding. First, Chen Fanyu, a member from Nanxiang, gave a lecture on a new cosmological view, introducing the "Cosmic Expansion Theory." According to this theory, astronomers from various countries have concluded, based on observations of changes in the distance of nebulae, that it is sufficient to revise Einstein's general theory of relativity and has great significance in astronomy and philosophy. Next, Zhu Guangcai, a member from Beiping, gave a report on the measurement of longitude and latitude in Beiji Peak, Tianji Peak, Jinan, Xuzhou, Nanjing, Hangzhou, and other places. The instrument used for measurement was a theodolite. This instrument has not yet been imported into China, and there are few users. Therefore, Mr. Zhu first briefly explained the structure of the instrument and the principles of the application formulas, and then reported the measurement results. The presentation was clear and organized, moving the audience. After the lecture, the members had a brief discussion and then held a business meeting. First, officers were re-elected. Yu Qingsong was elected as president, Jiang Bingran as vice president, and Gao Lu and Zhu Kezhen, Dang Fuyuan as councilors. Gao Jun was elected as general secretary. After the election results were announced, the chairman stepped down, and the new president, Yu Qingsong, took over as chairman. The motions were discussed. There were twelve proposals and three additional motions, which were passed or rejected separately. Then, the admission of Ms. Tao Qiang as a new member was approved. The meeting adjourned at 1 PM. After the meeting, everyone went to the Jingchuan Sichuan Restaurant near Xinjiekou for a gathering. That night or the next morning, members from various places boarded trains on the Beijing-Shanghai and Tianjin-Pukou lines to return to their homes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, after the adjournment of the general meeting on the 6th, the Astronomical Research Institute hosted a public banquet for members from various places at its office in Gulou. During the banquet, Director Yu Qingsong delivered a welcome speech, and the members unanimously elected Li Shuhua, a member from Beiping, to give a reply. It is said that the number of out-of-town members attending the annual meeting in recent years has not been as many as this year. This is because this year's annual meeting also included a tenth-anniversary ceremony. Members from various places, from Guangzhou in the south to Beiping in the north, enthusiastically attended, renewing old friendships or forging new ones, shaking hands and celebrating, making it a grand occasion.</p>

<p>Yesterday Celebrated the 37th Anniversary of the University's Founding</p>
<p>Cai Yuanpei, Sun Ke, Ye Gongchuo, and Others Gave Addresses</p>
<p>The National Jiaotong University Industrial and Railway Exhibition is scheduled to close at 7:00 PM today. Yesterday was the tenth day of the exhibition. At 9:00 AM, there was a tree-planting ceremony and the opening ceremony of the Xuanhuai Garden. At 10:00 AM, the 37th anniversary of the university's founding was celebrated. At 2:00 PM, there was a women's basketball game (Liangjiang vs. Xiqing), and at 3:00 PM, there was a men's basketball game (Jiaotong University vs. Xiqing). At 7:00 PM, there was a regular meeting of the exhibition, at 8:00 PM, there was a student entertainment program and the screening of educational films, at 10:00 PM, there was a large gathering of faculty and students, and at 10:15 PM, there was a fireworks display. The details of each event are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e98">Opening Ceremony of Xuanhuai Garden <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The opening ceremony of Xuanhuai Garden was held in the campus at 9:00 AM yesterday. Over 300 guests, faculty, and students attended. First, Li Zhaoshi gave a report, stating that 37 years ago, Mr. Sheng Xuanhuai, the director of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Telegraph Bureau, requested the establishment of the school with the approval of the authorities. The location of the school was determined based on the recommendation of Dr. Ferguson from the Supervisory Court. Since its establishment, the predecessors who presided over the school affairs have been able to diligently implement the original purpose of cultivating higher education and have made progress every year. The bronze statue of Mr. Sheng in this garden was built twelve years ago to commemorate his founding contribution. At that time, the garden was also slightly renovated. In the future, it will need to be expanded. According to the school's regulations, the garden should occupy 17 acres of land and be planted with a variety of flowers and trees. Its magnificence will be beyond description. If statues of scientists, administrators, politicians, and engineers are erected along the winding paths, the impact on young students will be even greater. This garden is a part of the school scenery and is inherently beautiful. It is unnecessary to say more. I believe that appreciating the beauty of nature is the most pleasant way to regulate school life. The mission of the school is to study the truth and make it practical. Everyone knows that all practical things, unless they are good, are not enough to seek happiness for mankind. All expressions, unless they are beautified, are not enough to promote cultural progress. Therefore, I sincerely hope that the faculty and students of this school can cultivate a sense of beauty and inspire good ideas, which will be of far-reaching and significant value to school education. We are grateful for the beautiful and good garden left by our predecessors. After enjoying it, we are deeply grateful to Mr. Sheng Pinchen and his sons Sheng Zhiyao and Sheng Zuyu for their huge investment in expanding the garden, hence the name Xuanhuai Garden, to commemorate it forever. Next, Sheng Pinchen delivered an opening speech, saying that he was very honored to be invited by President Li to participate in the 37th-anniversary celebration of the school and the opening ceremony of the campus. Recalling that in the 22nd year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, his late father requested the establishment of the school by raising donations from the Steam Navigation Bureau and the Telegraph Bureau. The school was divided into the Upper Institute, the Middle Institute, the Normal School, the Mongolian School, the Special Class, the Attached Public School, the Translation Institute, the Eastern Language School, and the Commercial School. The funding did not come from one source, and the enrollment was not limited to one province. At that time, the atmosphere was just beginning to open up, and the class concept of scholars and workers still existed. Therefore, the subjects were limited to politics, economics, literature, and law. Later, higher-level students were sent abroad, and Nanyang Public School was designated as Nanyang Higher Public School to encourage the graduates. As a result, people were inspired, and talented people emerged. Gradually, they turned to civil engineering, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. Through the expansion and improvement of successive presidents and the hard work of the students, the school has become what it is today. Not only are the participants happy, but I believe that my late father would also be smiling in the afterlife. Tracing back to the 37 years since the school was founded, the predecessors who handled the affairs could not bear to let the previous achievements be forgotten and erected a monument to commemorate them. Recently, President Li initiated the construction of the campus, leaving a lasting name forever. I would like to express my gratitude and wish Jiaotong University a long life. Then, Zhao Jinqing, Shen Shuku, and others gave speeches, followed by a response from Sheng Pinchen. The ceremony was completed.</p>
<h3 id="e99">37th Anniversary Celebration <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>After the opening ceremony of Xuanhuai Garden, the 37th anniversary celebration of the university's founding was held in the Wenzhi Hall. Former presidents Cai Yuanpei, Ye Gongchuo, Sun Ke, and the son of the founder Sheng Xuanhuai, Sheng Zecheng, alumni Shen Shuku, Xu Peihuang, and more than 500 faculty and students of the school attended. The chairman, Li Zhaohuan, conducted the ceremony. First, the chairman delivered the opening remarks, followed by the awarding of prizes to students with excellent academic performance and the supplementary awarding of graduation certificates. Then, Xu Jintao and Sheng Zecheng gave speeches, and Cai Yuanpei, Ye Gongchuo, Sun Ke, and others gave addresses. Finally, music was played and the ceremony was completed.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Chairman Delivers Opening Remarks <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Li Zhaohuan delivered the opening remarks, stating that it has not been easy for the school to reach this stage after 37 years. He sincerely hoped that in the future, it would be able to follow the teachings of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, cultivate specialized talents, and serve the country and society to build a new China. In these 37 years, there have been many difficulties and changes. He briefly described the outline: The school was founded in the 22nd year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty. In the 31st year, it was renamed the Merchant Marine School. In the first year of the Republic of China, Mr. Tang Wenzhi became the president of the school, and the Nanyang University was established. From the first year of the Republic of China to the tenth year, the foundation gradually became solid. From the tenth year of the Republic of China, the school was divided into three branches in Beiping, Tangshan, and Shanghai. At that time, there was no definite connection. Fortunately, the Minister of Communications at that time recognized this and determined a complete plan to merge the three schools. From the tenth year of the Republic of China to the eighteenth year, there was a period of reorganization. At that time, Mr. Sun Zhesheng was the Minister of Railways, and Jiaotong University had a complete organization, establishing the foundation of the university to cultivate construction talents for the Three People's Principles and setting a five-year and ten-year plan for consolidation and expansion. Over the years, it has been stipulated that the Shanghai branch has the School of Management, the School of Engineering, and the School of Science, the Beiping branch has the School of Railway Management, and the Tangshan branch has the School of Civil Engineering and the School of Metallurgy. The above is a general overview of the school's situation. Today, it is a great honor to have the presence and guidance of Mr. Sun, Mr. Cai, and Mr. Ye. I hope they will provide guidance at any time to correct any shortcomings.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Former President Cai Yuanpei's Address <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Former President Cai Yuanpei's address stated that he studied here 20 years ago and served as the president of the school 5 years ago. Today, on the occasion of the 37th anniversary of the university, he is honored to participate in this grand event. Looking back on the past, he has a sense of the past and the present. Although the form of Jiaotong University has changed in these 37 years, its spirit has always been consistent. Therefore, all its steps have not been in the slightest error and can accurately start from the needs of China. In the past, Chinese people absorbed Western civilization only from the perspective of needs. If they could not win in war, they would engage in improving machinery. As a result, they discovered that Westerners had laws and politics in addition to weapons of war, so they learned law and politics. They also discovered that the ability of law and politics to be good depends entirely on education, so they engaged in education. It is truly a case of "treating the head when it hurts, and treating the foot when it hurts," only starting from the needs and not thinking from the root. This stable method is purely wrong. When Jiaotong University was first established, it was relying on the strength of Mr. Sheng Xuanhuai. At that time, it was only a training ground for politics. Later, if we want to seek the prosperity of this study, it is impossible without a good foundation in primary and secondary schools. Therefore, primary and secondary schools were established one after another. Later, knowing that education is the foundation of law and politics, the normal class was changed. Since the Republic of China, it was once under the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce and was changed to a commercial school. Soon after, it was under the Ministry of Communications, and transportation became a specialized subject, with transportation technology as the center of its education. The foundation of Jiaotong University was thus established. Now, the Shanghai branch has the School of Engineering, the School of Management, and the School of Science, the Beiping branch has the School of Railway Management, and the Tangshan branch has the School of Engineering. The academic system is very organized. At present, the Ministry of Education stipulates that any school that can be called a university must have more than three schools. The addition of the School of Science at Jiaotong University is based on this. Chinese people often pay attention to application and do not base it on principles. Science is the foundation of various applied sciences. If you want to develop applied sciences, you must pay attention to pure science. The rapid progress of Jiaotong University meets the needs of the times and is highly admirable.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Former President Sun Ke's Address <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Former President Sun Ke said in his address that four or five years ago, he hoped that the school would gradually progress according to a possible plan and become the most complete institution of specialized learning in China. Therefore, he had considerable plans for material equipment. He has only been away for two or three years, and the planned construction projects and the addition of disciplines have been considerably completed. This cannot but be attributed to the efforts of President Li. This school is a national specialized school of transportation technology. As the name suggests, it should pay attention to the specialized talents of transportation management and construction. However, he believes that the scope can be expanded and developed. The most needed thing for the country is science. The current problem in China is the problem of production. If production is not developed, the country's ability cannot maintain the country's survival, let alone compete with other countries in the world. This is to focus on science and use science to prepare for mass production. To develop industry, we should cultivate specialized talents in science. The school has civil engineering, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering, which have achieved considerable results, but the scope is too narrow, limited to transportation, and cannot be purely hot for production skills, which requires further efforts. Furthermore, the issue of national security and the consolidation of national defense cannot be achieved without specialized scientific knowledge and skills. Since September 18th, foreign disasters have been pressing. Talking about resistance to recover lost land is useless. In fact, not only is it impossible to recover lost land, but there is no guarantee to consolidate the original land, all because of the lack of talent to strengthen national defense. The materials and machinery required are even borrowed from other countries. What crisis is greater than this? Taking the war in North China as an example, the greatest need is, of course, military fire. China can not only not manufacture the latest weapons, but even infantry arms and ammunition cannot be supplied, and raw materials are also dependent on various countries. In addition, the power of river defense and navigation is declining. Once something happens, the closure can be worrying. At the same time, there is no way to supply the necessary military supplies domestically. Speaking of long-term resistance, how can it be successful? Therefore, the current need is to promote scientific talent, and the responsibility for promotion lies in this school. This school has a history of 37 years. Although it is not perfect, in terms of ability, it can take on this responsibility. I hope everyone will work hard. Next, Ye Gongchuo's speech is too long to record. Also, Zhang Ming, the former special envoy of the National Government to Nepal, came to the school yesterday morning to participate. President Li specially arranged for Mr. Zhang to speak about the transportation and education situation in Nepal after the meeting.</p>

<p>Year 21 of the Republic</p>
<p>In the year 21 of the Republic, the nation suffered an unprecedented national crisis since the founding of the Republic, much like a chronically weak body suddenly stricken with a seasonal epidemic, triggering a multitude of ailments at once. In politics, the entire nation was in a state of anxiety, with hardly a day of stability. In society, the rural areas were in decline, pushing almost the entire population towards unemployment. Economically, old-style commercial organizations were on their last breath, on the verge of collapse. Financially, capital was concentrated in urban areas, and the lifeblood of the interior was completely stagnant. In countries with developed transportation, well-established economic systems, and a high standard of living, such a situation would have long manifested in various forms of panic and disturbance, possibly even leading to internal strife. However, in China, due to underdeveloped transportation, immature credit systems, incomplete industrial organization, and a low standard of living, while not exempt from the aforementioned difficulties, the nation was spared from the collapse of its national economy. Perhaps because the thirsty are easily satisfied with a drink, and the hungry with food, even small financial assistance could facilitate the establishment of various industries and constructions! Recognizing this, our bank decided to maintain a policy of progress without retreat. We have been fully committed to assisting the cooperative movement for the consolidation of the financial sector and the improvement of financial organizations to ensure its success. We have also provided ample financial support to industries that lack capital and are unable to develop. We have worked to regulate agricultural products that cannot maintain reasonable prices due to the lack of financial assistance. We have also spared no effort to help complete construction projects in various provinces that require significant funding, while simultaneously striving to increase lending to the interior to correct the problem of cash concentration in urban areas. We firmly believe that in a country with an immature credit industry, the ability to avoid financial and industrial panic indicates that continuous financial assistance can indirectly promote social stability and order. Judging from the achievements of the past year, we are fortunate that our chosen approach has not been misguided. As a financial institution with twenty years of history, we are able to serve the country and society to the best of our ability during the most challenging period of national crisis, which our shareholders and colleagues can equally celebrate. In the past year, there have been a few developments in the country and society that have been somewhat encouraging. Apart from the war between the two Lius in Sichuan, there have been no major internal wars in the country. This is due to the military's awareness of the national crisis and the futility of internal conflicts. At the same time, various provinces have recognized the importance of building highways, which can be seen as a shift in the military's mindset. In the 21st year of the Republic, the Ministry of Finance did not issue any more public bonds, reversing the long-standing practice of the government living on debt, which can be seen as the first successful step by the financial authorities in consolidating revenue and balancing the budget. The government and society have gradually recognized the importance of promoting rural improvement, and the trend of citizens supporting domestic goods is becoming increasingly enthusiastic. These are all lessons learned from the stimulus of the national crisis, leading to a significant shift in the national mindset. It is deeply hoped that as a result of this shift, the difficulties encountered by our financial sector will be eliminated, and various efforts to improve the social economy will proceed smoothly with the understanding and cooperation of society. As the saying goes, "Adversity builds a nation," which is a sincere hope.</p>
<p>Bank of China's Operations in the 21st Year of the Republic</p>
<p>The year began with the national market still recovering from the floods of the 20th year and the Manchurian Incident, only to be followed by the January 28th Incident. In the middle of the year, battles broke out in Jiaodong. At the end of the year, there was internal strife in Sichuan. With the communists still not quelled and the rural areas in decline, the entire year can be described as having no peaceful days. The difficulties experienced by our bank in supporting the nation during this period were unprecedented. Fortunately, with the strength accumulated by the bank over the years and the hard work of our colleagues, we were able to maintain normalcy. This is the first thing we can report to our shareholders. The branches in Northeast China have adhered to the principle of focusing on business and not concerning themselves with other matters for many years. Therefore, even after the great upheaval, they have maintained their inherent position of commercial freedom and have not suffered any losses. The Chongqing and Chengdu branches, located within the sphere of influence of opposing forces, were inevitably subjected to coercion and extortion. The local staff diligently responded, refusing to lend or advance funds without collateral or unless all branches shared the burden, and fortunately, there were no special or individual losses. This is the second thing we can report to our shareholders. As for the Shanghai battle, the financial center was in extreme danger. Fortunately, all parties remained calm and were able to turn the crisis into safety. The bank's operations continued as usual, which is a symbol of national progress with everyone united, self-aware, and self-reliant. If the incident had occurred ten years earlier, I fear that even with a strong pillar, it would have been difficult to withstand the chaotic flow. This is not something our bank dares to boast about. As for the financial sector's capital in this year, it became even more surplus. Excellent investment avenues became narrower, and interest expenses could not be reduced. This was the trend of the times, and there was nothing that could be done about it.</p>
<p>I. Assets and Liabilities</p>
<p>Deposits</p>
<p>(A) Total Deposits: In the 21st year, the total balance of various deposits was 476,548,053.43, an increase of 13,891,686.45 compared to the 20th year. Breaking it down: (1) The balance of current deposits was 183,601,057.59, a decrease of 59,959,126.46 compared to the 20th year. (2) The balance of fixed deposits was 234,632,047.59, an increase of 60,389,383.98 compared to the 20th year. (3) The balance of interbank deposits was 58,314,948.25, an increase of 13,461,428.93 compared to the 20th year.</p>
<p>(B) Number of Depositors: The number of depositors in the 21st year increased almost exponentially compared to the 19th and 20th years, as shown below:</p>
<p>Total number of depositors in the 19th year: 76,127</p>
<p>Total number of depositors in the 20th year: 93,046, an increase of 16,919 compared to the 19th year</p>
<p>Total number of depositors in the 21st year: 114,493, an increase of 21,447 compared to the 20th year</p>
<p>(C) Nature of Deposits: The percentages of various deposits in the 21st year, based on the nature of the depositors, compared to the 20th year, are as follows:</p>
<p>Nature 20th Year 21st Year Percentage Increase/Decrease</p>
<p>Government Deposits 8.25 4.46 Decrease of 3.79</p>
<p>Industrial and Commercial Deposits 33.29 33.86 Increase of 0.57</p>
<p>Group and Individual Deposits 58.46 61.68 Increase of 3.22</p>
<p>Based on the above deposit number, depositor number, and deposit percentage ratios, we can know that (1) the avenues for capital utilization in the market are increasingly narrow, and people are seeking safe banks to store their money as fixed deposits; (2) the increase in industrial and commercial deposits and group and individual deposits is sufficient to show that society's trust in the bank is increasing year by year.</p>
<p>Loans</p>
<p>(A) Total Loans: Various loans in the 21st year: (1) The balance of current loans and overdrafts was 99,417,347.93, a decrease of 11,279,103.51 compared to the 20th year. (2) The balance of fixed loans was 189,437,068.20, an increase of 1,201,546.44 compared to the 20th year. (3) The amount of discounts and purchased term bills (including import and export usance) was 34,036,801.69, a decrease of 969,834.73 compared to the 20th year.</p>
<p>In summary, the total amount of the above three items is 322,891,217.82. Compared with the total amount of various loans in the 20th year, 183,854,208.66, the quantity seems to have decreased sharply. In fact, the item of deposits with other banks is essentially a deposit of cash. Before the 20th year, it was included in the number of loans. This year, the number of deposits with other banks has been changed to be listed under the cash in the balance sheet. If the deposits with other banks and other loans are combined, the decrease is not much.</p>
<p>(B) Nature of Loans: The percentages of loans in the 21st year, based on the nature of the borrowers, compared to the 20th year, are as follows:</p>
<p>Year Commerce Industry Public Utilities Interbank Groups Organizations Individuals</p>
<p>20th 21.79 10.14 1.08 15.02 1.37 47.19 3.41</p>
<p>21st 22.38 11.46 1.19 18.92 0.60 42.61 2.84</p>
<p>Percentage for certain purposes. In order to make a comparison with the 20th year, the number of deposits with other banks is still included. If only the interbank loans in the current loans and overdrafts section are included, they only account for 4.2%.</p>
<p>According to the above situation, it can be seen that although under the adverse environment of this year, the number of loans did not decrease excessively; and the policy of increasing industrial and commercial loans to assist production remains unchanged. The slight increase in fixed loans is due to the sharp increase in fixed deposits, which makes it necessary to seek longer-term fixed loans to balance them.</p>
<p>(Remittances) The total amount of remittances for the whole year in the 21st year was 752,215,307.72, which was 74.6 million yuan less than the 20th year, a decrease of about 9%; but it was still more than 176.6 million yuan more than the 19th year.</p>
<p>In recent years, due to the promotion of business, our bank has set up 145 branches; and even in places where no branches have been set up, we have tried to facilitate remittances; we have paid special attention to small farmers, industrial towns and market towns in the interior, in order to circulate funds and assist production; on the one hand, we have paid more attention to the speed of remittance procedures and the fairness of the remittance rates, so that in the last two years, the number of remittances has increased rapidly, from an average of 500 million yuan per year to more than 750 million yuan. As for the amount this year, the reason why it is slightly less than the 20th year is probably due to the following reasons:</p>
<p>(1) The domestic capital turnover is slow.</p>
<p>(2) The decrease in remittances from the Northeast accounts for a very large amount. Because most of the workers have moved back to Guannei this year.</p>
<p>(3) The blockade of customs and postal services in the Northeast.</p>
<p>According to the total amount of remittances this year, excluding 1,450,000 yuan of receipts from the Osaka branch and the Foreign Department, the number and ratio of receipts in the national area are analyzed as follows:</p>
<p>Area Total Amount Remitted in the 21st Year Percentage</p>
<p>Yangtze River Basin 371,864,000 yuan 49.5</p>
<p>North China 165,693,000 yuan 22.1</p>
<p>Three Eastern Provinces 123,907,000 yuan 16.5</p>
<p>South China 89,300,000 yuan 11.9</p>
<p>Again, based on the above remittance amount, the destination and quantity ratio are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Place Total Amount Remitted in the 21st Year Percentage</p>
<p>Shanghai 355,546,000 yuan 47.4</p>
<p>Tianjin 58,777,000 yuan 7.8</p>
<p>Other Places 336,442,000 yuan 44.8</p>
<p>It can be seen from the above table that funds in the interior are concentrated in the cities; and the amount remitted to Shanghai alone accounts for almost half of the total amount remitted by our bank, which is a very noteworthy phenomenon.</p>
<p>(Foreign Exchange) Since the 17th year, our bank has been granted a special permission from the government to handle foreign exchange. In addition to successively establishing a Foreign Department London Office and Osaka Branch, the original branches have also separately assigned personnel to actively handle foreign exchange business. However, since our country's industry and commerce have not yet developed, import and export trade is sluggish, especially exports; and our bank has a short history of handling foreign exchange, it is difficult for our foreign exchange business to be compared with foreign exchange banks in other countries. However, as a result of our bank's continuous efforts to strive for progress, there are still some things that can be said. The following is a summary of the major businesses handled by the Foreign Department and various branches in China this year:</p>
<p>Import Commercial Letters of Credit Issued 62,287,000 yuan</p>
<p>Import and Export Usance 43,358,000 yuan</p>
<p>Drafts and Telegraphic Transfers Issued 33,637,000 yuan</p>
<p>Term Bills Purchased from Other Ports 21,927,000 yuan</p>
<p>Collections 21,669,000 yuan</p>
<p>The above are converted into silver dollars based on the market rate of various currencies, which can give a rough idea. In addition to continuing to work hard to live up to its mission, it is also deeply hoped that (1) our Chinese merchants engaged in import and export trade will trust our bank, and our country's international trade will overcome the existing difficulties and move towards prosperity; (2) the government will continue to reward and promote industry and commerce to increase export trade, so that our bank can fulfill its duties, then our bank's foreign exchange business will be even more developed.</p>
<p>(Issuance of Convertible Notes) At the end of the 21st year, the amount of convertible notes in circulation in our bank was 184,426,936.51, a decrease of 7,322,202.83 compared to the amount in circulation at the end of the 20th year. The average amount of issuance and circulation of our bank in recent years has been around 170 to 80 million yuan. In fact, our bank believes that there is a trend of excess currency in the market, and it should not be expanded further; and with the Central Bank gradually becoming consolidated, we deeply hope that it will gradually become the center of issuance. Therefore, our bank does not adopt a positive promotion policy for issuance, but only maintains a considerable inherent amount to meet the urgent needs of those who trust our bank's banknotes.</p>
<p>(Marketable Securities) Our bank's marketable securities, calculated at the year-end market value, only account for 8% of the total assets, and the total amount is 64,544,446.21, a decrease of 7,480,051.67 compared to 72,024,497.88 in the 20th year, all of which are amounts received for repayment of principal and interest. The percentages of gold and silver securities are listed on the left:</p>
<p>21st Year 20th Year</p>
<p>Silver Securities 56.1 55.3</p>
<p>Gold Securities 43.9 44.7</p>
<p>Total 100.0 100.0</p>
<p>II. Profit and Loss</p>
<p>(A) Various Expenses: Various expenses in the 21st year were more than 6,066,000 yuan, an increase of only more than 28,000 yuan compared to the 20th year. It was found that the business volume of our bank in the 21st year did not decrease. Due to the situation, transportation, postal and telecommunications, and donations have increased; and the total amount of expenses can almost maintain the original state, which is the result of our bank's efforts to seek internal contraction over the past year.</p>
<p>(B) Profit Distribution: The net profit in the 21st year was 1,847,949.62, of which 1/10 was drawn according to regulations, that is, 184,794.96 as public reserve, and the remaining 1,663,154.66. This number plus the rollover of 71,480.99 from the previous year, minus the 7% interest paid to official and commercial shareholders, 1,729,819.00, the remaining 4,816.65 is still listed under the rollover of surplus.</p>
<p>Business Operations</p>
<p>(A) Maintenance and Support of Domestic Industry: The development of domestic industry has always been the business policy of our bank. Last spring, when the Shanghai Incident occurred, the market was tight. After the ceasefire, prices fell again. The foundation of domestic industry was weak, and most of them felt that turnover was difficult. In order to maintain the industry, our bank has made every effort to support those whose business is needed by the society and whose fundamental foundation is not flawed, in order to facilitate turnover. In the 21st year, loans to domestic industry totaled 38,435,423 yuan, an increase of 7,227,769 yuan, or 23%, compared with last year. The effect of this number can be said to be ten or a hundred times that of normal times. Shanghai increased by 4%, and other ports increased by 19%. The composition of various industries in the total amount of loans is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Cotton Mills 61.9 (2) Flour and Noodle Factories 11.9</p>
<p>(3) Silk and Satin Factories 5.5 (4) Egg Factories 4.9</p>
<p>(5) Food and Beverage Factories 4.0 (6) Chemical Industry 2.6</p>
<p>(7) Tobacco Factories 1.5 (8) Building Materials Factories 1.1</p>
<p>(9) Handicrafts 1.0 (10) Match Factories 0.7</p>
<p>(11) Clothing Factories 0.5 (12) Cloth Factories 0.5</p>
<p>(13) Dyeing and Weaving Factories 0.4 (14) Iron Factories 0.3</p>
<p>(15) Rubber Factories 0.2 (16) Paper Factories 0.2</p>
<p>(17) Others 2.8</p>
<p>(B) Assistance in Promoting Domestic Goods: Supporting factories is enough to promote production; however, the people's concept of domestic goods is still immature, and foreign goods are dumped fiercely. If factories are not assisted in promoting the idea of loving domestic goods and increasing sales channels, domestic goods industry will inevitably suffer setbacks in the middle. In view of this, our bank contacted Shanghai domestic goods factories and department stores during the high tide of the domestic goods movement and organized the "China National Goods Production and Sales Association". On the one hand, we studied production improvement and cost reduction; on the other hand, we worked hard to promote product sales and fair prices. We must make the producers meet the standards of social needs; and the consumers can easily buy domestic goods. In order to achieve universal effectiveness and widespread official publicity, a national goods introduction agency is attached to the production and sales cooperation association. The general office is set up in Shanghai, and branch offices are set up in various places where our bank is located, hoping to arouse the efforts of all sectors of society with the spiritual and material assistance of the bank; and hope that this type of agency can be completely independent in the future when it has a slight foundation, and it will still be run by the industry itself. At present, it is just beginning, and it is relying on the assistance of people with lofty ideals in various places.</p>
<p>(C) Relief of the Silk Industry: This year's silk market has declined, and old silk and old cocoons that can be made into silk have been overstocked to more than 35,000 dans. In addition to the silk factories' original capital depreciation, compared with the market price and the amount of mortgages, there is still a shortage of 12 million taels. Silk and cocoon mortgages of silver and money industries in various places are completely stranded. If no measures are taken to provide relief, not only will the export trade be in danger of being cut off; but the new cocoons will be on the market, and no one will buy them, and the farmers' livelihood will be affected suddenly. Our bank followed the silk industry colleagues and appealed everywhere. Fortunately, the two ministries of Finance and Industry and the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces enthusiastically maintained it, promulgated measures to rescue the silk industry, and issued treasury bills of 3 million yuan to subsidize the export of old silk. With this relief, the silk factories have seen a slight turnaround and have started work one after another; the cocoon merchants have also set up shops in the countryside to buy new cocoons, which can stabilize the situation for a while. Until the end of the year, after a year of hard sales, the export of old silk exceeded 20,000 dans. Our bank did not dare to let go of silk and cocoon loans; however, when the new cocoons were on the market, we joined local powerful groups to make cocoon loans of about 2 million yuan. As for silk factory loans, we did not stop because one or two factories were idle, and we still maintained those who were sincerely improving. It is deeply hoped that the authorities of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces will have a further plan for the improvement of the silk industry, so that our bank's silk industry loans will have further assistance.</p>
<p>(D) Regulation of Rural Economy: In the 21st year of the Republic of China, following the floods of the previous year, the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang had a bumper harvest. Due to the lack of ability to hoard in the society, there was a temporary oversupply of agricultural products on the market, and the price of rice and grains was at an unprecedented low, and the rural economy was in decline, and dangerous signs were emerging. Although our bank is not an agricultural bank, it still adheres to its purpose of serving the society, and cooperates with Jiangsu Farmers Bank to contact local banks in Changshu, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou and other places to consider making farmer rice and grain mortgages to regulate it. In Zhejiang, there are also loans in Changxing, Wuxing and other counties. The purpose of this business is to enable farmers to store surplus rice and grains in warehouses as collateral, borrow loans, and maintain their lives. When the price of grain rebounds slightly and sales are active, they will redeem and sell them again, so that they will not be in danger of bankruptcy due to the impact of low prices. It is known that the thorough solution to rescuing the rural economy cannot be achieved by one or two banks in a short period of time. This is just a temporary solution, and it is only a temporary rescue. The fundamental rescue depends on the overall planning of the government and the authorities of various provinces, and our bank will do its best to assist it.</p>
<p>(E) Completion of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway: Since the financial community had poor investment results in previous railways, they were hesitant to make railway loans. If the transportation industry cannot progress for a long time, it will be more difficult for local products to circulate, and it will further promote the decline of rural areas. The Zhejiang authorities intend to build the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway, and first build the section from Hangzhou to Lanxi, borrowing 3.6 million yuan. Our bank will first assume 2.7 million yuan. This year, it is planned to extend to Jiangshan, and we need to borrow another 2.5 million yuan. Our bank will take on another 1.9 million yuan. It is scheduled to be completed in the first month of the 23rd year. Our bank does not hesitate to risk investing this huge amount of money, hoping that the government authorities will change their concept of railways, considering it as a kind of national social undertaking, not as a source of income; at the same time, we hope that all sectors of society and our colleagues will rise up together and make a determination that they can no longer allow the government to ravage railway investment in order to save the crisis of economic decline.</p>
<p>(F) Progress in Serving Overseas Chinese: In recent years, the world economy has been sluggish, and the economic situation of overseas Chinese has become more difficult. The number of unemployed people has increased, and the number of people returning to China has increased. Remittances from Southeast Asia have gradually decreased. In the Americas, remittances have not decreased due to the high price of the US dollar. Our bank's branches in Fujian and Guangdong strive to be thorough in serving overseas Chinese. The amount of remittances from overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia is 20,934,700 yuan, and the amount in Europe and the United States is 3,065,000 yuan. The total amount of remittances from overseas Chinese through our bank is 24,019,700 yuan.</p>
<p>(G) Achievements of Overseas Offices: The London office has been established for three years, and the amount of subsidies has been decreasing year by year, and this year has seen a slight surplus. The Osaka office encountered the Sino-Japanese Incident immediately after its establishment. Fortunately, it was handled properly, and this year also saw a slight surplus.</p>
<p>(H) Improvement of Investigation Work: The investigation business relies on long-term training and cultivation. Our bank has recently devoted itself to the general investigation of domestic and foreign economic conditions. Publications include: (1) Bank of China Monthly (2) Financial Statistics Monthly; (3) Compilation of China's Domestic and Foreign Debts; (4) Illustrated Charts of Recent China's Foreign Trade, etc. The information contained therein is always used by domestic and foreign economic researchers. This year, we have further started credit investigations, conducting well-intentioned and thorough research on the credit and asset status of all legal persons and individuals. In addition to the joint efforts of more than 140 branches of our bank to communicate with each other, we have also initiated the organization of China Credit Investigation Agency as a joint investigation agency for various Chinese banks. Since its establishment, it has been trusted by the society, and its business has been developing day by day. At the same time, customers of our bank and domestic and foreign colleagues have consulted our bank directly due to business relations more than ten times a day, and our bank has done its best to investigate and reply. It not only allows the parties concerned to know what to choose, but also enhances the other party's reputation and status. It has a slight effect on promoting the completion of accurate transactions and increasing commercial prosperity.</p>
<p>National Crisis and National Economy</p>
<p>The September 18th Incident left the greatest scar on the development of our nation and the formation of our country; and the event that expanded the scope of this incident was the Shanghai January 28th Incident; and the event that made the nature of this incident more permanent and profound was the establishment of the so-called "Manchukuo".</p>
<p>(Manchurian Problem) On March 1st of this year, Japan forcibly created a so-called "New Manchurian Country" to separate it from China. China has thus lost 80,350 square miles of land (35% larger than the Japanese mainland), one-thirteenth of China's population, and one-quarter of China's foreign trade. This is an unprecedented change since the founding of the country. Not only has peace in East Asia been broken from now on; but also the peace of the world is under threat. The great political influence is generally recognized by the world; and the importance of the relationship to the national economy needs to be explained systematically. 1. Loss of Trade Among all the ports in China, the ports of Manchuria have always been surplus ports. The number of exports to foreign countries was 288,607,000 Haikwan taels in the previous year, accounting for one-third of China's total exports; and it was 326,075,000 taels last year, accounting for almost more than one-half of the total exports of other ports. The goods imported from Manchuria to mainland China were 97,864,000 taels in the previous year; and 147,781,000 taels last year. What used to be included in domestic trade is now regarded as import trade. Calculated this year, only the port of Dalian, including the two items of exports to foreign countries and exports to various ports in mainland China, China's loss in foreign trade has reached 248,022,000 Haikwan taels; and the goods imported from mainland China to Manchuria were 89,844,000 taels in the previous year, which decreased to 66,296,000 taels last year, a decrease of 23,548,000 taels. Taking only the port of Dalian as an example, the amount of imports from mainland China this year has decreased by more than 1 million taels. The total loss of the three items is 250 million taels. China's international income is calculated at 100 million taels per year, and now Dalian alone has lost one-quarter of it.</p>
<p>2. Loss of Resources Manchuria is an important agricultural, forestry, and mining area in our country. Agricultural products include soybeans, sorghum, millet, corn, and wheat. The annual output is about 147 million shih (about 20 million metric tons). Among them, soybeans alone account for more than 66% of the world's output. The annual output of tussah silk is about 26,000 dan. The storage capacity of forest products is about 616.2 million shih. The annual supply is between about 3.3 million shih and 5.4 million shih, all of which are used for construction and paper-making raw materials. Livestock products such as cattle, horses, mules, donkeys, sheep, and pigs total more than 15 million heads. The annual output of wool is about 1 million catties, other types of wool are about 3 million catties, and leather and all kinds of fur for cold protection are about 24 million pieces, and its export amount accounts for half of the country. The annual output of aquatic products is about 4 million yuan. The annual salt production is about 820 million catties. In a few years, the output of salt fields for candidates can reach 1.5 billion catties, which will be one of the important industries in Manchuria. Coal and iron are the most important minerals. The iron reserves in the Anshan mine alone are about 300 million tons, and the total reserves in the entire territory are about 1.7 billion tons. The annual output is about 200,000 tons. Although the mineral quality is not good, it has important significance in national defense. The coal reserves are about 300 million tons, and the annual output is about 10 million tons. The oil shale layer in the Fushun mine is about 500 million tons. According to the oil content of 6%, 300 million tons of oil can be refined. This is the larger number of resources in Manchuria. The number of exports this year is used as evidence:</p>
<p>Agricultural Products about 300 million taels Mineral Products about 60 million taels</p>
<p>Livestock Products about 8 million taels Forestry Products about 6 million taels</p>
<p>Aquatic Products about 7 million taels</p>
<p>Total 381 million taels</p>
<p>From the above numbers, we can know the richness of Manchuria's resources. With this inexhaustible raw material, not only can the industry expand its unlimited power; but also the national economy can achieve self-sufficiency. Is what Japan has gained not what China has lost!</p>
<p>3. Loss of Base for Chinese Immigrants In the past six or seven years, people from Shandong and Hebei provinces have been migrating to Manchuria every year, either due to local unrest, heavy taxes, or years of famine and difficult living conditions. The number of people migrating to Manchuria has been as high as one million; the number has been as low as five or six hundred thousand. The population density in Shandong Province is 550 people per square mile and 512 people per square mile in Hebei Province; while the population density in the Three Eastern Provinces is only 61 people per square mile, so there is plenty of room for immigration. In the six years before last year, the number of people who migrated to Manchuria from the two provinces was about 4.78 million; the number of people who left Manchuria was about 2 million; that is, the number of people who permanently immigrated was more than 2 million. In the future, in order to protect Japanese immigrants, the Japanese have advocated restricting Chinese immigrants, so China has lost a large area of people for migration, and this surplus population will make Chinese society uneasy.</p>
<p>4. Financial Losses Since the merger of the official banks in the three provinces and the establishment of the so-called "Central Bank of Manchuria", all financial exchanges in the three provinces are handled by the Yokohama Specie Bank and the Bank of Korea; that is, all external funds in Manchuria, which used to be handled by Chinese silver shops and money shops, are now transferred to Japanese banks. In the past, the commercial funds of the Dongbang deposited in Shanghai or Tianjin were tens of millions, but this will be greatly reduced in the future. The loss to China's total financial funds is not a small amount. At the same time, the issuance of the Bank of Communications and the Bank of China has been set to be recovered within a limited period of time; and the amount of gold coupons issued by the Bank of Korea has increased from 90 million yen at the end of last year to 100 million yen; the amount of silver coupons of the Yokohama Specie Bank has increased from 5 million yuan at the end of last year to 14 million yuan.</p>
<p>5. Losses in China's industry In recent years, China's light industry has gradually developed, and Manchuria has gradually become a consumer market for China's light industry. The main items are cotton textiles, cotton yarn, flour, cigarettes, and paper. Last year, the proportion of each item imported from mainland China to Manchuria was as follows:</p>
<p>Commodity Name Percentage of Total Imports from Mainland China Percentage of Total Imports in Manchuria</p>
<p>Cotton Textiles 26 49</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn 13 86</p>
<p>Flour 15 46</p>
<p>Cigarettes 7 52</p>
<p>Paper 4 36</p>
<p>This year, it has decreased significantly. Cotton textiles decreased from 11.6 million taels in the previous year to 8.3 million taels; cotton yarn decreased from 20 million taels to 4.9 million taels; flour decreased from 18 million taels to 8.5 million taels; in the future, it will be gradually excluded by Japanese goods; and driven away by tariffs. The most affected is Shanghai; followed by Qingdao and Tianjin.</p>
<p>6. Financial Losses According to the report of the Ministry of Finance: Since the Northeast Customs was robbed by the Japanese, the customs revenue last year decreased by 15 million Haikwan taels. After June, even the money to pay off public debts was not remitted. Since the salt tax was robbed in the first half of last year, it has decreased by 23,529,434 Haikwan taels. According to the above, the great economic significance of the Manchurian region to mainland China is by no means comparable to the two states of Alsace-Lorraine in France. The French have been painstakingly trying to compete for it for more than 40 years. What will we do?</p>
<p>(Shanghai Incident) The Shanghai January 28 Incident had no direct relationship with the September 18 Incident, and the fierce boycott of Japanese goods in the South was an automatic retaliatory measure by the Chinese people for the September 18 Incident. Japan was ignorant of the cause and effect, and wanted to suppress this movement in the South by force, which led to the Battle of Shanghai. Using our densely populated markets as a testing ground for their aircraft and heavy artillery, the</p>

<h3 id="e119">Group Life Insurance Is a Great Gift <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Group life insurance is the only good way to solve the modern problems of mankind. Therefore, before explaining it, we must first briefly describe what the problems of mankind are.</p>
<p>The current economic panic is not due to the poor principles of economics, but because the People's Government and various enterprises do not know how to apply these principles. The most obvious is that the cost of living wages cannot be included in the cost of production. Wages are only enough to cover food, clothing, housing, and education, and there is no surplus for savings to prepare for unemployment, illness, old age, and death. This cannot be called a living wage. Unless this point is widely understood by the public and a living wage becomes the first item of expense in business costs, the relationship between labor and capital cannot be established. Difficulties and terrors will increasingly drive the public's psychology to the path of reaction. However, if the theory of reaction is applied to public interests, it will be more harmful than beneficial.</p>
<p>The method of how to implement a living wage is not within the scope of this article. This matter is important and will gradually find appropriate methods to solve it out of necessity. Before this is solved, the public's difficulties can only be alleviated by public funds, which may be the plan for public insurance. However, this is fundamentally inappropriate and hinders public morality.</p>
<p>A person has a need for livelihood at all times, but a person's productive capacity is limited to one period in their life. To seek the needs of a lifetime, all from the supply of one period, there is no other way than to obtain a living wage during the period of productive capacity.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to study how a part of the living wage can be saved in the most scientific and appropriate way to prevent the needs of old age, illness, or even death. The readers or listeners should first understand that the main purpose of this article is not to study how the academic undertaking of life insurance is formed or how it is managed, but to clarify that the system of life insurance has a necessary relationship with human happiness, and that there are many years of experience to prove that it is the only reasonable method that can enable people to save enough during one period of their lives to provide for their needs for a lifetime.</p>
<p>Insurance is the scientificization of ordinary savings methods. Ordinary savings can only accumulate little by little, take a long time, and are not guaranteed. The method of insurance, from the time of paying the premium, the guarantee is already in hand. Any individual or group who is planning for a rainy day is insured. This awareness can be said to be innate. Among animals, there are many who store food for the winter. How can human knowledge be less than that of animals? The shortcomings of the current economic system are that most of the able-bodied are unable to prepare for a lifetime of needs during their productive years, in addition to their current food, clothing, and housing.</p>
<p>Since there have been humans, there has been a need for insurance. The earliest record of insurance is recorded in the Bible. In Egypt, Joseph stored food during the seven years of harvest, which enabled him to save countless people during the seven years of drought. This can be said to be the oldest group life insurance. Only with group life insurance can the benefits of life insurance be easily popularized. After the prevalence of group life insurance, the laboring class can benefit from life insurance. The previous systems of retirement pensions and unemployment relief can now all be included in group life insurance.</p>
<p>The term "group life insurance" has not been popular for long. Employee life insurance companies of large enterprises or large organizations can underwrite it with general insurance policies. There are two main points: 1. The insurance company allows exemption from physical examination; 2. The insured organization must have all employees join, with no one able to be an exception. In other words, those who are not healthy are not allowed to come to life insurance alone. Although its popularity is not long, its effectiveness is already apparent, so progress is very rapid. Here are some records to illustrate. In the United States and Canada, in the past year of about ten months, the group insurance underwritten by each company reached about 1 million yuan, and it is estimated that 51,000 households will benefit from life insurance throughout the year. This amount will be 89 million yuan.</p>
<p>In economic terms, group life insurance has become a necessary consideration for modern industrial management. Except for China, it has become a need recognized by both labor and capital to protect the families of workers. It also covers disability and accidental injury protection. Group insurance is incomplete if it does not have these protections, and the cost is not difficult to calculate.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "The heavens have unpredictable winds and clouds, and people have misfortunes that may happen at any time." Listing its protection costs in wages is an indispensable condition for human happiness. Although the progress of group life insurance is rapid, the protection it provides is often limited due to the inability of businesses to raise sufficient living wages. If this is not corrected quickly, the pressure of life and the global recession will increase.</p>
<p>Among the employees, there are those who are capable of insuring independently, but according to professional life insurance calculations, the insurance agencies of group life insurance must require all employees to join, and no employee can be different.</p>
<p>In group life insurance, what has already been recognized as unable to be included is the guarantee of unemployment. At the Geneva Economic Conference on January 10 of this year, statistics show that the number of unemployed people in 20 countries reached 30 million, with an annual wage loss of 420,000.</p>

<p>Life insurance contains two kinds of common sense about life:</p>
<p>First, "Those who do not think far ahead will have worries close at hand." Therefore, when you are young and strong, you should prepare for old age, and when you are healthy, you should plan for times of illness. Second, "Daily plans may be insufficient, but yearly plans will have surplus." Therefore, small amounts of money, accumulated over a long period, can be used for major expenses. -- Hu Shih</p>
<p>Mr. Shi Dai is a giant in both the insurance and journalism industries. He currently serves as the General Manager of American Asiatic Underwriters, General Manager of American International Assurance Company, President of American International Savings Bank, and Assistant Manager of Franco-American Insurance Company in Shanghai. He is also the owner of the Da Mei Evening News. Mr. Shi is from California, USA. At the age of sixteen, he was already engaged in business and demonstrated exceptional business acumen, quickly rising to prominence. He held positions in a certain weekly magazine, a bank, a trust company, and an insurance company. In his spare time, he devoted himself to studying, diligently researching law. At the age of twenty-one, the California government granted him the honor of being a lawyer, allowing him to practice law in various courts. In 1917, when the European war was raging, Mr. Shi joined the U.S. Army, serving for more than a year. After being discharged, he came to China and founded the largest insurance company in the Far East, American Asiatic Underwriters, and other businesses. With his broad talents and keen insight, he worked tirelessly, achieving remarkable results rarely matched by others.</p>
<p>Millions of pounds (sterling). Also, the American publication "Eastern Insurance Magazine" once reported that Germany's unemployment relief system completely broke the budget because unemployment caused by the depression far exceeded what insurance calculations could estimate.</p>
<p>Everyone in the world must have work to do, and it must be evenly distributed. There must be a living wage, and improvements in living standards must be sought. No matter what economic panic the world experiences, the fundamental principles of social organization must not be shaken. Life insurance can stabilize the economy, and group life insurance is even more of a blessing for the laboring class. The feelings between labor and capital cannot be enhanced without it. In short, life insurance is one of the best ways for people to cooperate to improve human happiness, making wealth accessible to ordinary people, allowing for fair distribution, and eliminating extreme poverty. The huge capital accumulated by life insurance companies is the material expression of various excellent human qualities such as wisdom, thrift, and sacrifice. Are there people in the world who want to replace economic principles and systems established through years of development with sociological theories? The national wealth represented by life insurance companies, namely the huge capital saved by the food-producing masses, is sufficient to encourage and reward human conscience and is a perfect answer for them. The public is improving day by day, and this unique system of self-help and cooperation, which is life insurance, is now more prosperous than ever due to social needs and long-term testing, evolving from individual insurance to group life insurance.</p>
<p>New Development of Sun Life Assurance Company in One Year</p>
<p>New business actually reached 284,098,930 Canadian dollars</p>
<p>In the past year, all industries have shown signs of decline, but the business report released by Sun Life Assurance Company at its annual meeting yesterday still showed significant progress. The total amount of life insurance underwritten as of December 31 last year was close to 300 million Canadian dollars. The new business accepted during the year, limited to premiums paid, actually reached 284,098,930 Canadian dollars, and the number of new insurance policies also increased by 95,122. The decline of world commerce began in 1929, but the public's trust in life insurance has not been affected in the slightest, as demonstrated by the continued development of Sun Life Assurance Company. From that year to the end of the previous year, the number of insurance policies and group insurance certificates issued by Sun Life increased by 200,050, the total amount of life insurance underwritten increased by 480 million Canadian dollars, and total assets increased by 43 million Canadian dollars, now totaling 611,436,152 Canadian dollars. All of these developments are due to the public's trust in life insurance, which is by no means accidental. According to Mr. Macauley, Chairman of the Annual Meeting, there are fundamental solutions regarding the recovery of world commerce, and the upcoming World Economic Conference should be a great success. In previous economic panics, the average duration was no more than twenty months, but this economic panic has lasted for three years and four months, almost twice as long as previous ones. The most unsettling feature of this economic panic is the continued decline in prices of various commodities. Since 1929, the wholesale prices of various commodities have fallen by 35%, making it unprofitable for all industries, or if there is profit, it is minimal, and the purchasing power of all parties has also decreased as a result. Such is the reality, and the result is known. Only recently have there been slight signs of recovery. The speaker following the chairman was Mr. H. Warren K. Hale, Vice-President and General Manager of Sun Life Assurance Company, who stated that the company has had a very strong resistance during the three years of economic panic. During that period, the number of policyholders increased by 200,000, now totaling 1 million, and the total amount of life insurance underwritten increased by nearly 500 million Canadian dollars, while total assets also increased by 43 million Canadian dollars. He believes that life insurance can reduce personal economic pressure, and other benefits are not counted. He said that in past economic panics, the company paid an average of 10 million Canadian dollars annually to policyholders and their beneficiaries. Public trust in life insurance did not begin today; it is only through sound management that such trust can be obtained, and the continued development of Sun Life Assurance Company, with the help of 1 million policyholders, is no accident. His confidence in the company can be proven by several things, namely that a portion of last year's new business came from old policyholders, and the number of insurance policies allowed to lapse was less than in previous years. According to Mr. Hale, the characteristic of the previous business report was the large amount of new business, which amounted to 284 million Canadian dollars at a time when world commerce was declining, resulting in an increase in the total amount of life insurance underwritten to 3 billion Canadian dollars, a truly astonishing achievement. As for investments, there was not much difference from the previous year. Last year's investments were mostly limited to government bonds issued by the Canadian government. Several types of guarantees were sold at good prices last year, yielding a profit of approximately 250,000 Canadian dollars, and the value of other guarantees was also greatly reduced when the report was prepared, making the company even more solid. Last year's total income was 161 million Canadian dollars, and after deducting various expenses, there was a net surplus of over 13 million Canadian dollars. The company's development every ten years is now listed below:</p>
<p>Total Life Insurance Underwritten Total Annual Income</p>
<p>1932 (Canadian dollars) 2,880,069,828 161,407,285</p>

<h3 id="e121">Insurance and Children's Dust <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Children living under the current living standards in China must rely on their parents for support from birth to the age of eighteen or twenty. During this period, the burden on their families is not only the three basic necessities of clothing, food, and shelter, but also includes the expenses of education, training, and entertainment. These expenses (referring to education, etc.) were considered luxury expenses in the past, but today, they are considered necessary because they can determine the success or failure and happiness of children's future careers. Therefore, all expenses other than the cost of children's living expenses can be regarded as investments in the future happiness and development of children, as well as contributions to the promotion of social civilization. People who have received good education and training in their youth will certainly be able to earn higher incomes when they go to work in society. Many people are self-sufficient throughout their lives, but become dependent on others in their old age. Giving children good education and training costs money, but this is indeed spent appropriately and in accordance with economic principles, because this kind of investment has a time to be recovered. Even if they cannot recover the amount they invested, the whole society benefits greatly because young people receive considerable education. It is a common and natural phenomenon for children to rely on their parents for support before the age of eighteen or twenty, because these eighteen or twenty years are the period for children to prepare for their lifelong work. From the perspective of the individual and, more broadly, from the perspective of society, children should not have any economic burden during their development period, which is also the period when they are receiving education and training. If the head of the family dies unfortunately and does not leave any funds to support his family until his children can support themselves, then one of the following three things must happen: (1) the widow goes out to work, (2) the children go out to work, (3) the widow and orphans rely on charitable organizations. The disadvantages of each will be discussed in turn: (1) Disadvantages of widows going out to work The problem of widows going out to work depends on the number of people who depend on their wages for a living. The more children there are, the more urgent the need for widows to go out to work. However, when children are young, they desperately need their mother's care. If the mother goes out to work, the children will inevitably be left at home without care or supervision. They will not only be unable to enjoy the joy of family, but also be easily get bad habits due to external temptations. Family education is the foundation of school education. Children who have not received good family education are difficult to become useful talents when they grow up. Therefore, widows going out to work has a great impact on the education and future happiness of their children. In addition, widows often work excessively and become ill due to having to work outside and manage housework at the same time. (2) Disadvantages of child labor Under many circumstances, children's work is detrimental to their future happiness and career success. Their education and training are all prevented. Their chances of future career success are sharply reduced. They often only get inferior positions. The wages are low and the chances of future development are few. They often have to work in unsanitary and unclean environments. They are at risk of accidental events involving machinery. They are exposed to the bad environment of the company and work with a group of men and women without high morals. Children are often surrounded by various temptations that adults consider very serious. These temptations have a greater impact on children who are hired as workers and children who are born to parents without good leadership. As a result, their health, morality, and ambition will be hit. (3) Disadvantages of the act of providing for children The act of providing for children is indeed of great benefit to the majority of children who cannot maintain their lives. However, if there is another way to maintain the happiness of children until they can provide for themselves, then this method should be used to replace the act of providing for children. In the past, children's charities, similar to other charitable organizations, often required children to leave their families and enter almshouses, orphanages, or other similar organizations, giving them a mark of being supported and subjecting them to the constraints of public discipline. All of this is considered very appropriate by the administrators of charitable organizations, but from the perspective of children's happiness, it is inevitably too unnatural.</p>
<p>Life Insurance and Dependent Children</p>
<p>Modern people not only have to prepare for their own needs, but also have to bear the responsibility of providing for the next generation who will inherit the future, as well as the elderly who have completed their work. Among the people in the country who depend on wages, 85 percent earn less than 2,000 yuan per year. They are certainly unable to save enough money to provide for their children in the event of an unexpected death. However, through life insurance, breadwinners can at least set aside a fund to provide for their children's living expenses for several years. For example, ordinary breadwinners cannot accumulate thousands of yuan in savings in many years to cover the living expenses of their children after their death. But with only 30 yuan of insurance per year, a life insurance estate can be prepared immediately. This is really like pre-ordering a loan of thousands of yuan that will be canceled upon death, with an annual repayment of 3 percent. In this way, only a small amount of savings is needed each year to guarantee that the descendants have assets of thousands of yuan. According to today's living standards, thousands of yuan can provide a child with frugal living expenses for four or five years, or several children for two or three years.</p>

<h3 id="e122">The government will never give up the right to inspect factories in the concessions. <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Council convened a special meeting</p>
<p>To amend the Yangjingbang Regulations</p>
<p>Inquiries from the Chinese Ratepayers' Association</p>
<p>Mayor Wu issued a statement yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association yesterday sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession regarding the issue of the concession authorities' intention to inspect factories, inquiring about the truth. At the same time, it received a letter from the Secretariat of the Shanghai Municipal Government, which made some statements on the matter. The two letters are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e123">Letter to the Municipal Council <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Dear Sirs, According to the Chinese sock factory, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession has banned night work and sued the factory for violating police regulations. The factory asked the Municipal Council whether it had previously proposed to manage factories within the concession and whether it had consulted with the Chinese government authorities and reached an agreement on the matter (the original letter has been seen in this newspaper on the 5th). The association believes that the management of factories is part of China's entire labor administration. Whether it is permissible to divide or delegate the management is unknown to the association. The Shanghai Foreign Ratepayers' Meeting of the Public Concession will hold a special meeting on the 19th of this month to amend Article 34 of the Land Regulations of Yangjingbang in order to manage factories. If this action has not been permitted by the Chinese government, it can be regarded as undermining the integrity of China's labor administration. If the truth can be shown to the association before the 11th of this month, it will be followed. The letter is hereby sent to request your attention and reply. With sincere friendship,</p>
<h3 id="e124">Public Letter from the Municipal Government <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Dear Sirs, Having received a letter from the Mayor regarding the case of the concession authorities intending to convene a special meeting of taxpayers to amend Article 34 of the Land Regulations of Yangjingbang in order to manage factories, and having received instructions to investigate, this government believes that the promulgation of the Factory Law is intended to improve the working conditions of laborers and promote the harmony of labor-capital relations. Factories in the special district account for about two-thirds of the city. If the law is not implemented simultaneously, not only will inspections be impossible, but factories outside the special district will also have excuses. Therefore, officials have been sent repeatedly to discuss the matter, but no agreement has been reached. The Municipal Council cannot formulate labor regulations in the special district to be followed by taxpayers (as stated by the legal adviser of the bureau, Mr. Liddell, in 1925). Therefore, it wants to obtain the legal basis for managing factories by adding supplementary rules. However, factory inspection is established to implement China's labor policy, and its purpose is to promote the healthy development of the entire national economy, which has nothing to do with local governance. Therefore, the bureau cannot cite Article 9 of the Yangjingbang Regulations, which provides for "planning for governance to ensure proper management," to seize the right to inspect factories by any means. It must be known that the territory within the concession still belongs to China, and the people within the concession naturally have the same obligation to obey the will of the state as those living outside the concession. The concession authorities cannot pass a resolution to push the people within the concession outside the scope of national power. In short, this government believes that factory inspection in this city is part of China's entire labor administration and cannot be abandoned. However, in order to implement the law as soon as possible, it is willing to sincerely negotiate with the concession authorities on a proper solution within the scope of not conflicting with the central laws and regulations. Please investigate accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Mayor Wu's Speech <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, regarding the Municipal Council convening a meeting of foreign taxpayers to amend Article 34 of the Land Regulations of Yangjingbang in order to manage factories within the concession, the reporter visited Mayor Wu yesterday and received the following speech: Since the promulgation of China's Factory Inspection Law, the Chinese authorities have repeatedly sent officials to negotiate with the concession authorities in order to implement the law in all districts of the city. The promulgation of the Factory Law was originally intended to improve the working conditions of laborers and promote the improvement of labor-capital relations, and its implementation should not be delayed in the slightest. Moreover, in recent times, incidents of accidents and deaths of workers due to poor factory management have been heard from time to time, which makes the necessity of factory inspection even more apparent. Factories in the special district account for about two-thirds of the city. If the issue of factory inspection in the special district is not resolved for a long time, inspections will be impossible, and factories outside the special district will also have excuses. The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession has always adopted a laissez-faire policy towards factories in the concession. From the perspective of the Municipal Council's functions, it is fundamentally impossible to handle this matter. Therefore, in 1925, when the Municipal Council organized a child labor investigation committee and drafted a child labor ordinance, the legal adviser of the bureau at the time, Mr. Liddell, argued that the Municipal Council's attempt to formulate labor regulations to be followed by taxpayers had no legal basis. This time, the Municipal Council intends to add supplementary rules, which of course,</p>
<p>is intended to seek a legal basis. Regardless of the outcome, even if the taxpayers add supplementary rules to the regulations, the amendment of the Yangjingbang Regulations cannot take effect without the consent of the Chinese government. The state has the supreme, sole, and indivisible sovereignty over the people living within its territory. This is the highest principle of constituting an independent state. Now, the territorial rights of the concession still belong to China, and the people living within the concession naturally have the same obligation to obey the will of the state as those living outside the concession. The concession authorities cannot arbitrarily push the people within the concession outside the scope of national power. This is a general principle in politics. Moreover, law is the rule of the state that compels the behavior of the people. The constitution of law must be based on the state, and the execution of law must be based on the subject of the state. Now, the concession authorities are attempting to seize the power to enforce the Factory Inspection Law, which means that China formulates the law, but the execution of the law is seized by others, making China's law independent of China. This is not permissible in law or reason. This is a general principle in law. Although Article 9 of the Yangjingbang Regulations stipulates that the purpose of establishing the bureau is to "plan for governance to ensure proper management," factory inspection is to implement China's labor policy, and its purpose is to promote the healthy development of the entire national economy, which has nothing to do with local public security. The authorities cannot seize the right to inspect factories by changing the head and face. This is in terms of the Yangjingbang Regulations. In short, the Chinese government cannot abandon this matter in principle. However, in order to implement the law as soon as possible, it hopes to negotiate a proper solution with the concession authorities within the scope of not violating the central laws and regulations.</p>
<h3 id="e126">The British Chamber of Commerce attaches importance to the issue of factory licenses. <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, the Shanghai British Chamber of Commerce believes that the special meeting of foreign taxpayers to discuss the issue of factory licenses is very important. It is deeply concerned that the number of attendees that day will not meet the statutory quorum of one-third of the total number of foreign taxpayers, which will prevent the meeting from being formally convened. It is currently strongly urging qualified taxpayers to attend without fail and recruiting volunteers to conduct personal propaganda among foreign taxpayers to inform them of the importance of this matter.</p>
<h3 id="e127">The Municipal Council's policy on factory inspection <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Council intends to improve the conditions of factories within the concession by requiring them to obtain licenses. However, detailed management cannot be achieved in a short period of time. Therefore, the Municipal Council intends to first pay attention to hygiene, factory safety, fire prevention, and panic prevention. Such regulations have always been included in the various licensing regulations. However, if factories are required to obtain special licenses, then safety can be expected even more. Shanghai is originally an industrial area, but the administrative power is divided into three. Therefore, the Municipal Council has expressed its willingness to cooperate closely with other administrative agencies in order to implement measures to improve the current situation. If the amendment of Article 34 of the supplementary rules is passed, the bureau is prepared to incorporate the provisions of the Chinese Factory Law, which have already been implemented in the Chinese area, into the factory licensing regulations after deliberation. The Municipal Council has the responsibility to guarantee security. Therefore, it should seek the safety of the factory site as far as supervision and guidance can reach. If it can agree with the Chinese authorities on how to implement the provisions of Chapter 8 of the Factory Law, then it can be implemented uniformly. Before this understanding is established, the Municipal Council can only add the various conditions to the licensing regulations in order to achieve the purpose of security. In view of the current commercial situation, the Municipal Council is well aware that the improvement measures must be gradual. Therefore, the first step may be to only require factories to apply for licenses, without charging license fees for the time being. The licenses will not be issued immediately, but will be given an opportunity to improve within a year or a slightly longer period. During this period, the bureau will send personnel to inspect and instruct on the items that should be handled, and will strive to avoid hindering labor. This will depend greatly on the cooperation of the factory owners. Regarding the license conditions, the simple items will be paid attention to first, and the complex items will be postponed. First, unauthorized additions that are dangerous must be demolished, and those that are not dangerous must also be approved. Second, the address must be clean, such as painting the walls, wiping the windows, and sweeping away the garbage. The reputation of cleanliness must be handled immediately. Third, the stairs must be safe and unobstructed, with railings added to the sides of the stairs, the floor should be intact, the fire doors must open outwards, and must not be locked during work hours. All passages must not be blocked by machinery. Fourth, elevators, openings, and balconies must be equipped with railings. Fifth, in order to prevent overcrowding, a certain number of cubic feet of air per person must be adequately regulated. All of this can be done without much money. However, there are other aspects to safety, such as steam boilers and other pressurized equipment, air compressors, smelting furnaces, gas generators, etc., which must be inspected annually by qualified engineers and issued a certificate proving their safety. In addition, measures should be taken to protect machinery, such as adding covers to power transmission belts. The use of explosive chemical reactions and the generation of dust must be made safe. Other matters can be considered later. In the first step, any accidents must be reported immediately to the local situation, and the needs and other circumstances should be taken from the management regulations.</p>

<p>The central government has determination and arrangements for military affairs against Japan.</p>
<p>Citizens should do their best to save the country from disaster.</p>
<p>The Shanghai All-Groups Joint Conference National Resistance and Self-Salvation Association yesterday afternoon at 3:30, was held at the Sichuan Road YMCA auditorium. Li Liejun was invited to speak on the recent military situation in North China and the opening of political power. Liu Shixiong chaired and introduced the speaker. Li then began his speech. Wang Zhaowu, Wu Mai, and Xiao Bingzhang then expressed their opinions in succession, requesting Li to convey them to the central government. Li accepted them one by one, and the meeting adjourned at 5:00 pm. The main points of Li's speech are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e129">After September 18th <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident in Shenyang, the people have been greatly stimulated and should unite to jointly face the national crisis. Regardless of the size of their abilities or the extent of their power, they should all do their best to unite and save the country from disaster. This is the unanimous demand and call of the people of the whole country, and the ruling party has also used it as a slogan. However, in fact, the more they talk about unity, the more they separate. From within the party to the people of the whole country, it is all the same. It can be seen that the realization of unity cannot be achieved by empty words. It is necessary to seek appropriate methods, namely, fundamentally reforming the political system and resolutely resisting Japan.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Abandoning Talent <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The Sino-Japanese conflict is by no means something that can be resolved in a year or two; at the shortest, it will take ten or eight years, or perhaps twenty or thirty years, or even extend to a century. With such a responsibility for the survival of the nation, it is borne solely by the Kuomintang. Even if all Kuomintang members were the most intelligent and wise, even if they were all the elite of the time, the total number of party members in the country would not exceed 400,000, which is only one-thousandth of the national population. It cannot be said that among the 999 out of every thousand people, there is no talent left. The situation of abandoning talent, which violates the principle of making the best use of everyone's abilities, is conceivable. To the extent that the vast majority of abandoned talent can be used for the country, it is necessary to first ensure political equality for the people in order to save the current national crisis and suggest an eternally solid foundation for the nation.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Political Equality <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Our country is nominally a republic, but in fact, the people have no political power to speak of. With the national crisis as it is and the political system as it is, it is unavoidable to be accused of "hanging a sheep's head and selling dog meat." The Premier's will combines the principles of nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood, with the aim of achieving equality in international affairs, politics, economics, and legal status. If the people have no freedom and have not attained equality in politics, then equality in international affairs cannot be achieved, and equality in economics is even more empty talk. Therefore, from the perspective of our national system and from the perspective of the Premier's Three Principles of the People, the opening of political power is something that cannot be delayed.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Opening of Political Power <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the protection of civil rights, the declaration of the First National Congress of the Kuomintang explicitly included the freedoms of assembly, association, speech, publication, residence, and belief for the people in the political program. Subsequent Second, Third, and Fourth National Congresses all had resolutions. The idea of opening up political power has been brewing since the Fourth National Congress. Yu Yuan, Zhangjiakou, and other places returned south to Nanjing and Beijing, lobbying for more than fifty days. What they were engaged in was the two matters of resisting Japan and opening up political power. These two matters are the most important and also the most ordinary today. The importance is very obvious. What is meant by ordinary is that it is the unanimous demand of the people of the whole country and does not contain any overly high-sounding rhetoric. The central responsible comrades all expressed sincere agreement, hence the proposal to convene a National Assembly ahead of schedule.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Recent Military Situation <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>As for the recent military situation in the north, the garrison north of the Yellow River reaches [omitted] hundreds of thousands, and those on the front lines along the Great Wall and in various parts of Chahar are also close to [omitted] hundreds of thousands. The military strength cannot be considered weak. The people and soldiers in the north previously had complaints about the government's lack of determination and planning to resist Japan. However, since the outbreak of the war in Jehol, the government has been determined to resist and has also made considerable arrangements, but it is still considered insufficient, leading to the fall of Jehol Province. In the future, it is hoped that the government will have an overall plan; otherwise, allowing various localities to make local responses will also be sufficient to express popular sentiment, but will not help the overall situation. In Baoding and Nanjing, I met with responsible figures in the central government and learned that the central government is indeed determined to deal with Japan and is already engaged in overall preparations. However, due to various factual circumstances, its strength has not yet been seen by the people of the country in a very short period of time. At the appropriate time, Jehol will certainly be recovered.</p>
<h3 id="e134">No Compromise <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>After I returned to Shanghai, I heard various rumors saying that the government had news of a compromise with Japan. I dare say that although the government's past measures have been questionable, it will never be so confused as to do this. According to my conversations with various important figures in Beijing, they all expressed a firm attitude and would not change so quickly. However, while the people should not be easily misled by rumors, they should also not relax their supervision of the government for a moment.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Representatives of Various Leagues and Banners in Inner Mongolia Petition for the Removal of Shi Qingyang <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Ignoring Border Affairs, No Progress in Tibetan-Mongolian Affairs</p>
<p>Please Reorganize the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission to Save the Burning Situation</p>
<p>Wangong of various leagues and banners in Inner Mongolia, as well as representatives in Beijing, expressed their dissatisfaction with Shi Qingyang, the chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. When Wang Jingwei returned to the country and arrived in Shanghai, the representatives came to Shanghai to welcome him and petitioned for the reorganization of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, as reported in previous newspapers. The day before yesterday, representatives Dekejike, Chen Shaowu, and others petitioned the central government to remove Shi Qingyang in order to protect Western Mongolia. The petition is recorded below:</p>
<p>Regarding the fall of Jehol, the petition reads: Since the fall of Jehol, the whole country has been indignant. We, who are registered in Mongolia, have suffered this great change of losing our homeland. The tombs of our ancestors have become ruins, and our elders, relatives, and friends have been slaughtered by the enemy. Our grief is especially deep, and our tears are endless. In addition to hoping that the central government will quickly recover the lost territory, there is one more thing for which the chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, Shi Qingyang, bears considerable responsibility for the fall of Jehol. His crime is no less than that of Tang Yulin, but it has been neglected by the people of the country. That is his failure to perform his duties. In this fall of Jehol, the people of the country all know that it was Tang Yulin who retreated without a fight. The reason why he retreated without a fight was that the Mongolian and Han people of Jehol had suffered years of oppression and exploitation by Tang, accumulating resentment for a long time and planting deep poison. They took the opportunity to oppose Tang in order to free themselves from their predicament, thus giving the enemy an opportunity to take advantage of. This matter is certainly hateful, but its situation is also pitiful. Tang's crime is unforgivable.</p>
<p>The Mongolian people are indignant, and Shi Qingyang is the head of the highest organ of Mongolian and Tibetan affairs. Since Jehol is a part of Mongolia, and its people have suffered for years and accumulated grievances, Shi should have investigated and advised the central government to eliminate hidden dangers. However, he did not do this. He only knew how to control the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, lording it over in the capital, to pursue his pleasures of singing, dancing, and hunting. He abandoned Mongolian affairs. The matters concerning Mongolia and Tibet that should have been handled in the Political Tutelage Outline were not handled at all. The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission has become a bureaucratic yamen, wasting national funds and squandering time. May I ask if Mongolia and Tibet can tolerate such a bureaucracy without falling into the hands of foreign races? Previously, Guo Wang and more than a dozen other Wangong representatives in Beijing suggested to the central government to reform Mongolian administration, but Shi Qingyang obstructed them in every way, causing the Wangong representatives to angrily return north and issue a telegram pointing out his faults. However, Shi did not repent and insisted on his own way, causing the people of Mongolia to be filled with resentment and to suspect the central government because of their hatred of Shi. People like He Xige Wang, the prince of Jerim League, and Deselaitobu Wang, the king of Zhaowuda League, heard the news and suddenly defected to Japan. Our compatriots in the mainland are not aware of the serious situation that has been created.</p>
<p>In order to protect Western Mongolia, most of Mongolia has now been lost. In order to maintain the only remaining Western Mongolia, that is, to preserve the first line of defense in Chahar and Suiyuan, we cannot allow our good borderland to be buried by him alone, and millions of Mongolian compatriots to be used as enemies by him alone. We hope that the central government will learn from the fall of Jehol and not use a policy of appeasement and indifference, ignoring the direction of Mongolian sentiment, saying that it is not important to the border situation. Therefore, we loudly call out to arouse the attention of the people of the country and to give sympathy. Together, we urge the central government to immediately remove Shi Qingyang, reorganize the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, and give the Mongolian and Tibetan people the opportunity to participate in politics in order to save this precarious Mongolia. We are willing to be pioneers at all costs, and we will not stop until we achieve our goal. In addition to submitting copies, we hereby submit the ten major crimes of Shi Qingyang on a separate sheet. Respectfully presented. The attached list of crimes is omitted.</p>

<p>More Than 100 Representatives from Various Trade Unions Attended</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Reported on the Situation in the Northeast in Great Detail</p>
<p>The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions welcomed General Zhu Ziqiao yesterday at the meeting hall at No. 117 Fuyou Road. At the same time, Mr. Zhu was invited to report on the recent situation in the Northeast and the situation at the front lines. More than 100 representatives from more than 60 trade unions attended. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>More than 100 representatives from more than 60 trade unions, including the Shipping Timber Industry, Nanhuo, No. 1 District Water and Electricity, Transportation, Gangpian, No. 1 District Paper Making, Shanghai-Ningbo Shipping Staff, No. 4 District Cigarette Rolling, No. 9 District Soap and Medicine, No. 7 District Cotton Weaving, Postal Workers, Pharmaceutical Industry, Sauce Industry, No. 6 District Water and Electricity, No. 1 District Shipbuilding, No. 5 District Cotton Spinning, Military Uniforms, No. 10 District Cotton Spinning, No. 4 District Water and Electricity, etc., including Zhu Xuefan, Ye Xianggao, Shao Xubai, Li Yongxiang, Lu Jiyun, Huang Jiabang, Zhou Xuexiang, Li Mengnan, Li Hua, Shen Jiabin, Ma Liqing, Zhao Zhenhui, Qi Jiamo, and others, attended the meeting.</p>
<p>The chairman gave a speech. First, Chairman Zhu Xuefan gave a speech, stating that General Zhu was entrusted by various groups in the city to preside over the work of providing relief to the volunteer armies in Peiping, which was quite arduous. General Zhu is old but still does not hesitate to endure hardship and work for the country. His noble character and passionate spirit of saving the country are admirable. This time, we should welcome him back to Shanghai. We are especially fortunate that General Zhu has graciously come to visit us.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu gave a report. Then, Mr. Zhu Ziqiao gave a report, stating that the enemy forces in the Northeast are destroying everything. The volunteer armies are fighting with great difficulty. This has also been recorded in the newspapers, so I will not repeat it. The enemy forces' methods are extremely cruel. For example, in the Battle of Pingdingshan, some people fled to the top of the mountain, and the enemy forces pretended to say that the volunteer armies had retreated, luring the people down the mountain and machine-gunning them, leaving no one alive. The volunteer armies in the Northeast are still unwilling to surrender and are fighting fiercely with the tyrannical Japanese, such as Lao Beifeng and others who are particularly brave. Japan uses Manchukuo banknotes exclusively to buy goods at high prices, and refuses to use other banknotes from the Zhengjin, Taiwan, and other banks. This is because the Manchukuo banknotes have nothing to do with them. If the bank closes down one day, they can ignore it. Also, when fighting, they always use the puppet Manchu army as the front line, while the tyrannical army uses machine guns and artillery to suppress them from behind, causing the Chinese to kill each other. I have seen a map of puppet Manchuria drawn by the Japanese, which distinguishes all the provinces and regions only by different shades of color, including Suiyuan, Chahar, Inner and Outer Mongolia, and Hebei, which shows that their ambition to expand their territory is endless. The national army at various passes of the Great Wall, such as Song Zheyuan, Shang Zhen, Wang Yizhe, He Zhuguo, Sun Dianying, and others, are extremely brave. The only difficulty is the unevenness of the roads and the inconvenience of transportation. The front line needs at least heavy-duty trucks. The troops stationed at various passes currently need at least 700 heavy-duty trucks. Because there are no trucks, the horse-drawn carriages in Peiping and Tianjin have been requisitioned. However, now is the busy farming season, and mules and horses are urgently needed. If there are trucks, some of the donkeys and horses can be released back so that the farmers can cultivate the land. Now the troops are stationed in barren mountains and fields, and they have no way to buy the items they need, so they urgently need relief items. Our purpose is to provide relief as long as they can resist Japan, whether they are volunteer armies or the national army.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Yoshizawa Left Shanghai Yesterday Morning <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng She, Yoshizawa, the former Japanese Foreign Minister, came to Shanghai with the former Japanese Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs and parliamentarians on the 31st of last month. He left Shanghai on the Dalian Company's Changchun Maru at 12:00 noon yesterday and went to Qingdao. The ship was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai at 9:00 AM yesterday, but Yoshizawa waited for Iwaki Hashimoto, who went to Hangzhou the day before yesterday, to travel together, so it did not start sailing until 11:00 AM yesterday. Iwaki Hashimoto and two others were sent to Hangzhou by Yoshizawa on the 6th of this month. It is rumored that the two of them represented Kogawa in visiting Mr. Wang Zhengting, but Yoshizawa himself denied this, saying that they were only traveling to Hangzhou. Those who went to the Huangpu Wharf to see him off yesterday afternoon included Yoshizawa's son-in-law and his wife, Iiuchi, as well as Japanese Consul Ishisa and Counselor Ariko of the embassy. It is scheduled to arrive in Qingdao at 2:00 PM today. After staying in Qingdao for a while, he will go to Peiping and Tianjin to engage in activities, and then go to the three northeastern provinces.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Sharp Decline in the Transportation of Japanese Goods to Hankou <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>The Owner of Baihualou Was Assassinated</p>
<p>Those Who Sell Japanese Goods Are Panicking</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants Are in a Difficult Situation</p>
<p>According to yesterday's Japanese Shanghai Daily, at 10:00 AM on the 4th, two people suddenly came to the Baihualou stationery store at the entrance of Huafeng Lane, Zhengjie, Wuchang, to meet with the store owner, Mr. Qian. After talking for a while, he was assassinated. The murderers escaped from the scene. After an investigation by various parties, Baihualou has a close relationship with a certain Japanese foreign firm and specializes in selling Japanese paper. He had recently received a warning from the Anti-Traitor Group, but Mr. Qian ignored it, so he suffered today's misfortune. Since the Wuhan National Goods Promotion Committee organized an investigation team, the goods transported from the Japanese Qing Company's warehouse have been strictly monitored. Therefore, Japanese merchants have been in an unprecedented predicament. The cargo carried by the Japanese Qing Shipping Company from March 25 to April 3, a total of four voyages, averaged about 125 tons of imported goods per voyage and no more than 50 tons of exported goods. The Luoyang Maru, which departed on April 3, imported only 15 tons of goods and exported only 4 tons of goods, which is an unprecedented record.</p>

<p>The rally declaration states: Our country now has only two ways to deal with the tyrannical Japanese. If these two ways are not taken, the country and the nation will have no room to exist. The first way is to use military force to counterattack and drive the Japanese army out of our country. This is the business of our government, because our country already has funds for military expenses and already has two million troops. As long as the senior officers exert their previous courage to fight privately, they will be able to give the Japanese army serious lessons, just like the 19th Route Army, the 5th Army, and the 29th Army, to achieve our goal of eliminating foreign invaders. The second way is to use national products to counterattack and eliminate inferior Oriental goods from our country's market. This is the business of our people. Now there are many people who complain about our compatriots who sell Japanese goods and complain about the financial industry for accommodating Japanese goods merchants. We believe that all compatriots will not sell Japanese goods, and any financial industry that does not have a Jewish taste will not accommodate Japanese goods merchants. But what about us? Try to ask yourselves if you have a desire to take advantage of cheap Japanese goods? Can you not buy foreign goods that are suspected of being Japanese goods? Do you dislike the properties of national products that seem expensive and dislike their prices because they are not as good as foreign goods? We do not want to judge our gentlemen compatriots with the heart of a villain, but the facts tell us that the above questions cannot all be answered negatively. But we must know that the reason why Japanese goods are cheap is because our national goods exist, otherwise they must be expensive. The reason why Japanese goods pretend to be foreign goods or are managed by non-Japanese merchants is to see the effectiveness of our resistance. The counterattack of national goods against Japanese goods will surely succeed. We hope that our government will mobilize to eliminate the Japanese invaders within our borders, but we should also mobilize ourselves, use national goods to counterattack, eliminate Japanese goods within our borders, and strengthen our defenses. We should break off relations with those who sell Japanese goods and those who help sell Japanese goods. We should not communicate with them. We should use, introduce, and support national products, so that their production costs are low and their sales markets are wide. If this is the case, the government plans for the top, for military counterattacks, and the people plan for the bottom, for national products counterattacks, both sides work together to turn the tide. The tyrannical Japanese are not enough to be our enemy. This is a special declaration.</p>

<p>The Fish Inspection Association Makes a Big Propaganda</p>
<p>A Young Man Was Arrested and Released</p>
<p>Jin Chuxiang, Huang Zhanshi, and Zhang Xinchang, standing directors of the Fish Industry Inspection Enemy Goods Association, led more than 20 staff members to Jiangtian Wharf in the 16th Concession at 3:00 AM yesterday, erected several white bamboo cloth flags with slogans such as "Do not buy fresh fish caught by the enemy, buying enemy fish again is like being a cold-blooded animal." At that time, it was raining heavily. The inspectors gave passionate speeches to the people and vendors, and the listeners were moved. Then, thousands of people were filled with enthusiasm and immediately bought three cans of kerosene to thoroughly sprinkle more than 600 boxes of enemy goods little yellow fish. Some vendors passed by with their noses pinched. It was reported that a young man named Xu Yuanji was detained in the police station and was soon released.</p>

<p>-The Ministry of Communications Has Issued an Order-</p>
<p>Regarding the right to directly send and receive telegrams in China for the Great Northern, Great Eastern, and Pacific Three Water and Electricity Companies, the Ministry of Communications has now negotiated to recover them.</p>
<p>Pan Chengjiong, Sun Xichen, and Li Jiqing have been appointed as the directors of receiving and sending for the Great Northern, Great Eastern, and Pacific Companies, and the International Telegraph Bureau has been ordered to receive the telegraph receiving and sending offices set up by the three companies in Shanghai as soon as possible. As of last night, the International Telegraph Bureau had not received this order. According to reliable sources, the order has been issued by the Ministry of Communications and will arrive in Shanghai soon. Therefore, the right of the three companies to directly send and receive telegrams in China will be implemented within a few days. According to the Greater America Evening News, Mr. Fulton, the manager of the Great Eastern Telegraph Company in Shanghai, said that the new submarine cable contract signed by the Great Northern, Pacific, and Great Eastern Companies and the Ministry of Communications is very satisfactory. The consultations between the two parties have been going on for a long time. The recent resumption of negotiations has been welcomed by all parties. Now that the contract has been signed, the business of receiving and sending telegrams will be transferred to the Chinese Telegraph Bureau, and the company has obtained satisfactory guarantees to maintain its efficiency and existing standards. Therefore, both parties are completely satisfied with this contract. After being accepted by the headquarters of the three companies, it was signed on the 5th of this month. According to the current contract, the three companies recognize Chinese sovereignty, but their activities in Shanghai can be extended for fourteen years. After the business of receiving and sending telegrams is transferred, a Westerner will still be assigned to assist the Chinese director in management. The contents of the contract include: (1) Abolishing the previous landing rights granted to the three companies, (2) Stipulating the landing years of submarine cables, (3) The Ministry of Communications recovering the right to directly send and receive telegrams, (4) Revising the percentage of income from submarine cable services received by the Chinese government, (5) Recovering land cables and overhead lines, (6) The Tianjin-Peiping-Gugou line will also be received by the government, (7) Abolishing the Shanghai-Hong Kong submarine cable operated by the Fuzhou Bureau of the Great Eastern Company and the Xiamen Bureau of the Great Northern Company.</p>

However, Ms. Ye Jiabi and others, representatives of the women's community in Hubei, were temporarily unable to go due to illness.

<h3 id="e166">Dispute in the Fashion Industry: Some Workers Still Have Not Resumed Work <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Because Jintai Xiang Violated the Decision</p>
<p>The Union Asked the Party Headquarters for Instructions Yesterday</p>
<p>Dagon News reports that a strike broke out among workers in various fashion companies in the Fuzhou Road area. After mediation by party and government agencies, three measures were signed, and it was decided that all workers would resume work yesterday morning. Suddenly, some workers still did not resume work temporarily. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Resumption of Work: At 9:00 AM yesterday morning, representatives of the Fashion and Garment Workers' Union, together with the striking workers of various stores, successively entered the stores to resume work. However, the owner of Jintai Xiang Fashion Store, Hu Jinhai, declared to the workers that the wages could only be supplemented by one dime per piece. The workers of the store believed that the party and government agencies decided that the price must be restored (the original price was 2.2 yuan per piece, but now only one dime is supplemented, so each piece is still only 2 yuan). Expressing dissatisfaction, they reported to the union. The union sent personnel to negotiate with the owner of Jintai Xiang, but there was no result. Therefore, workers from seven or eight fashion stores, including Meida, Huaxin, and Xinda, did not resume work. Request Instructions from the Party Headquarters: Because the attitude of the Jintai Xiang capitalists was persistent and could not be resolved, and the dispute was caused again, more than 20 directors, including Li Chengzhang and Gao Depei, went to the Municipal Party Headquarters in the afternoon to request instructions. Zhou Lianze, the general manager of the Civil Movement Section, received them. After inquiring about the cause, he promised to send personnel to investigate together with the Social Affairs Bureau and then deal with it.</p>

<h3 id="e170">The Situation of Shanghai Textile Mills Urgently Awaiting Improvement <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>In the past six years in Shanghai, textile mills have had the most factory fires. According to investigations, some textile mills or weaving departments have very poorly organized internal affairs, which makes them prone to fire hazards, and the risk to workers' lives is also very high after an accident. The points that urgently need attention and improvement are: (1) Many dust threads are hung on doors, windows, walls, electric lights, and all protruding or hollow places, as long as several inches, without being cleaned, and the air is full of dust, so that black clothes or female workers' hair are white. (2) The windows are filled with dust, so there is insufficient light, which leads to the opening of unnecessary lamps and candles. (3) The floor is either old or rotten, or even has holes. In the event of an accident, when the crowd runs around, one person will lose their footing, which will cause many people to fall. (4) The elevator openings for goods are not fenced off. (5) The doors to the stairwells are often locked or blocked by machines and objects. (6) In textile mills, it is necessary to increase the temperature in the air. For older factory buildings, the wooden floor may rot as a result, or it may be slippery and difficult to walk on, or the wires may be moldy due to humidity, resulting in electrical leakage. In short, due to the lack of organization of internal affairs, there are many dangerous factors. However, among the factories, there are also some with excellent order and no criticism. The dust is removed with vacuum cleaners, and the humidity is increased with new methods. The windows are wiped at any time, the machines are properly positioned, and the equipment for emergency exits is sufficient. A certain Chinese textile mill only seals the emergency exits that are not equipped for daily access with red paper strips instead of locking them, so that this door can be opened immediately in case of an accident. This method is quite imitable.</p>

<p>Another 4,000 Jiangbei New Hams Were Detained</p>
<p>Dozens of Traders Petitioned the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau's implementation of meat inspection in the city has aroused opposition from the cured meat and ham industries. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. The news of yesterday's dispute is compiled as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e172">Goods Arriving at the Data Wharf Were Detained <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>The ham and wind meat that the ham traders have been detained by the Health Bureau at the South Station for days totals 166 pieces. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce is currently in charge of negotiations. Unexpectedly, the industry transported another 4,000 new dried hams from Jiangbei Xinshenggang via the Data Shipping Company yesterday. The goods belong to Ruishenghuo on the ball field. Just as the company had received the Data Company's bill of lading and had not yet gone to pick it up, the goods were forcibly detained by the Health Bureau and sent to the First District Public Security Bureau for storage. When Ruishenghuo heard the news, they believed that the goods were all new hams, and if they were detained for a long time, they would be damaged. Therefore, they immediately sent a letter to the industry association to quickly negotiate.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Dozens of Ham Traders Appeal to the Chamber of Commerce <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Due to the detention of goods at the South Station and the Data Company Wharf for days, the cured meat and ham traders jointly went to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to appeal yesterday afternoon, including North Wanyouquan, Junfeng, Ruishenghuo, Fuhe, Yicheng, Houfeng, Guangyuan, Gongmaoheyuan Da, Yicheng, Donglai, Tongfeng, and dozens of others. The Director General of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Zheng Chengqing, received them on behalf. After the petition representatives stated their opinions, Mr. Zheng promised to send personnel to negotiate with the Municipal Health Bureau.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Transshipment Industry Association of this city sent a letter to the Ham Industry Association regarding the detention of goods, saying, "Our member, Tongli Public Transshipment Company, transported more than 100 pieces of ham from Hangzhou. Due to the implementation of inspection by the Health Bureau, the guests were unwilling to accept them, and the carriers wanted to return them to the original consignor, but they were not allowed by the Health Bureau, so the goods were placed in the wind and dew, exposed to the sun and rain. If the time is prolonged, it will be damaged. Who will bear the responsibility? Therefore, our association has repeatedly reported it, and it is difficult to remain silent. Please quickly discuss the solution, see you again and obey, so as to avoid two mistakes and benefit the business. Please check and take care."</p>
<h3 id="e175">The Case of the Robbery of the Datongmen Meat Shop Was Quickly Solved <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Patrolman Qi Bin of the First Division of the Second District Arrested the Fugitive Thief</p>
<p>Confessed to Using Pliers and Sugar Cakes as a Gun to Commit Robbery</p>
<p>Tang Sanhe Meat Shop at No. 62 Ruyi Street, Datongmen, Nanshi, is quite prosperous. At about 7:00 PM the night before last (7th), the owner of the shop, Zhu Azeng, was settling the accounts when four robbers suddenly broke into the shop. One of the robbers showed an object shaped like a gun, threatened Zhu Azeng, and threw a water tank lid on his head, forcing him to hand over silver dollars. Then, they used a meat cleaver to split open the cash counter, and a total of more than 400 yuan in paper money was robbed, and they fled in different directions. After the First District Bureau of the Public Security Bureau received the report, they immediately sent police to pursue the robbers and telegraphed to the various districts to assist in the arrest. At the same time, Patrolman Qi Bin of the First Division of the Second District of the Public Security Bureau was leading several policemen to inspect pedestrians in his jurisdiction. At about 8:00 PM, he saw a person coming at the intersection of Fuyou Road. His clothes were ragged and his expression was flustered. Patrolman Qi suspected that his behavior was suspicious and immediately ordered him to stop and checked him. He found 51 yuan in silver dollars, 49 yuan in paper money, 23 yuan in large foreign notes, 12 small silver dollars with single corners, and 320 coins with double corners in his pocket, as well as two business cards of Lu Gaosheng and Wang Boxiong. When asked where the paper money came from, he hesitated. Patrolman Qi took him to the office. The director of the office, Shen Zhenhua, repeatedly interrogated him and asked if he had robbed it from Tang Sanhe Meat Shop. He then summoned the principal, Zhu Azeng, to come to the office to testify. He confirmed that he was one of the robbers. The thief admitted that his name was Cao Jinlong, 24 years old, from Pudong. He had been in the meat shop business. Two years ago, he had made a fake gun out of sugar rice cakes at Xieqiao Xuxilu and robbed a cigarette paper shop once. This year, he had robbed a grocery store at Xinzha Bridge once. This time, he and the fugitive Amlang and others held pliers wrapped in handkerchiefs as fake guns to Tang Sanhe to threaten the principal and rob hundreds of yuan in paper money, each of which was stored in several parts, and he confessed that he would sell the stolen goods with his friends in the Xiahui Tea House in Baxianqiao. After the director of the office, Shen, according to the confession, in addition to separately ordering the police to arrest the fugitives, and sending the business cards of Lu Gaosheng and Lu Boxiong to the Detective Team for research and investigation, he had the thief Cao Jinlong, together with the stolen goods, prepared to submit a document to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for verification yesterday (8th) morning.</p>

<p>Chinese and Western detectives from the Narcotics Division of the Shanghai Municipal Police, on the 23rd of last month, searched the Wufeng Customs Brokerage at 41 Yuegui Lane, Guangdong Road, and discovered twenty-five wooden crates filled with wood shavings and brick mud, and one wooden crate of rayon. They arrested five people, including Qian Hegeng, Qi Bingwen, Zhu Miaofa, Xu Jingxiang, and Wang Heshang. They were handed over to the First Special District Court, which ordered them detained pending investigation of the purpose for which Qian and the others had prepared the wooden crates, and then questioned. This was reported in previous newspapers. Now, after a detailed investigation by the Chinese and Western detectives in charge of the case, it has been confirmed that the wooden crates were prepared by Qian, Qi, and Zhu. They learned that there were twenty-five crates of rayon worth 3,941 taels, 2 mace, and 5 candareens of silver stored at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Yangshupu. They imitated the style and made twenty-six wooden crates. Except for one crate that also contained rayon, the rest were filled with wood shavings, crushed bricks, and mud, intending to pass them off as rayon, together with the one real crate, to declare them to customs for shipment. They planned to take the opportunity to swap the crates when leaving the customs warehouse, in order to achieve their cunning plan of substituting the fake for the real. Unexpectedly, the scheme was not kept secret, and the fake goods were seized before they were shipped out. However, Xu Jingxiang and Wang Heshang did not participate in the fraudulent scheme beforehand. Yesterday morning, the police sent Qian and the other five people to the First Special Court, where Criminal Judge Feng Shide opened the court for trial. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, explained the details of the investigation. He stated that Xu and Wang had no criminal evidence and requested their release. For Qian Hegeng and the other three, they were charged with joint forgery and should be punished according to the law. Judge Feng then questioned the three defendants, Qian Hegeng, Qi Bingwen, and Zhu Miaofa, one by one. He concluded that the facts of the crime were conclusive and sentenced each of them to three months imprisonment in court. The lead sheets and other items were confiscated.</p>

<p>Detective Lu Jinbao, deputy detective Zhou Ruzhang, Zhou Ruiyuan, and police officer Jin Chengshan, etc., from the French Concession police, learned that someone had privately set up a red pill manufacturing plant on the third floor of No. 3, Lane 391, Rue Foch, secretly manufacturing the pills for sale in the city, in violation of the ban. They rushed to search the premises at dawn yesterday and arrested seven people, including the owner, Wang Xichen from Suzhou, the accountant, Song Liansheng, and workers Zhang Heshang, Wu Jinzhong, Xu Bingsheng, Shi Shengjin, and Zhang Asan. They seized eight large packages of red pills of considerable value, as well as raw materials such as morphine, saccharin, and coffee essence, and medicinal powder, along with manufacturing equipment such as ovens and sieves. All of these were taken to the police station and then transferred to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District. The police lawyer, Yuan Jiahan, described the circumstances of the discovery and filed charges under Article 6 of the Anti-Opium Law for manufacturing opium substitutes, adding that the police had not yet conducted a detailed investigation due to time constraints and requested a postponement of the trial. Subsequently, the police officer reported the details of the case. After Judge Xiong Yincui questioned the defendants, he ordered them to be remanded in custody for further trial on a later date.</p>

<p>At the Shanghai South Station of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, at about 7 p.m. last night, the 37th express train arriving from Hangzhou had not yet come to a complete stop when a young woman suddenly jumped out of the train in a hurry, fell on the platform, and collapsed, barely breathing and unable to speak. The on-duty railway police and station staff rushed to her aid and gradually revived her. Observing that she had no external injuries, after about a few minutes, the woman claimed her name was Chen Fuyuan, 22 years old, and she lived in the Puyi Vocational Training Center opposite the Local Hall in the city. The stationmaster sent a police officer to notify her family to come. Soon, her mother arrived at the station and took the woman by car to the Shanghai Hospital for treatment. It is unknown whether her internal injuries are life-threatening.</p>

<h3 id="e181">Support Association for the Extrajudicial Killing Case in the French Concession Lodges a Serious Protest with the Municipal Government <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>-Punishment of Culprits, Apology, Etc., Have Not Been Fulfilled-</p>
<p>Regarding the case of the tragic deaths of two people and injuries to several others caused by extrajudicial capture in Xinqiao Street, French Concession, although several negotiations have taken place, the families of the deceased, Liu Fugao (from Ningbo) and Zhu Guding (from Chaozhou), have each been paid 2,000 yuan, and the injured have each been paid 500 yuan. However, the French Consulate has not yet fulfilled the promise of punishing the perpetrators, issuing a written apology, and guaranteeing that similar incidents will not occur in the future. Yesterday, the Support Association for Tragic Cases in Various Concessions submitted a petition to the Municipal Government and sent a letter to Du Yuesheng, requesting him to lodge a serious protest with the French authorities in order to resolve the matter as soon as possible. The petition is recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Petition to the Municipal Government <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Petition Regarding the Extrajudicial Killing Case, the French Consul's Reply is Biased, Requesting Further Serious Negotiations. The extrajudicial killing case in Xinqiao Street has aroused righteous indignation among the citizens. Therefore, an organization called the United Association to Support Tragic Cases in the French Concession was formed by various groups, and the association publicly elected Chairman Du Yuesheng of the Chinese Taxpayers' Association in the French Concession to make various demands to the French authorities. Subsequently, it was reported that the French authorities had accepted the following conditions: (1) Punish the murderers; (2) Guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future; (3) Provide compensation to the families of the deceased; (4) Provide appropriate compensation for the losses of the injured. However, because the families of the deceased had come to Shanghai from afar, they were inconvenient to stay in Shanghai for a long time, so Liu and Zhu were instructed to each receive 2,000 yuan in compensation from the French Municipal Council so that they could quickly move the coffins back to their hometowns. However, when receiving the money, it was clearly stated that although the money was received in advance, the punishment of the murderers and the guarantee must be strictly fulfilled. Chairman Du was also present at the time and reiterated this. Unexpectedly, the newspapers recently published the French Consul's reply to your government, which was infuriating to read. This must be refuted. According to eyewitnesses at the time, the extrajudicial police were arresting two women to compensate for their losses. One of the women was immediately compensated with one yuan, but she was blamed for taking a shortcut and suffering misfortune. The extrajudicial police did not understand Chinese and misunderstood the scolding, so they arrested her, forcibly dragging the woman's arm. Seeing that this was close to insulting a woman, voices of protest arose. The extrajudicial police did not sound an alarm or ask for help from other police officers, which shows that the situation was not serious at the time. Unexpectedly, he disregarded the consequences and immediately loaded his gun with live ammunition and fired two shots at the crowd. As a result, one person died to the right of the police officer, and one person died to the left of the police officer. The two injured were not in a straight line with the deceased, so who can believe it was a stray bullet? As for the claim that a number of passers-by came to attack, trying to rescue the person who violated the law, this is clearly a one-sided account of the police officer and cannot be trusted. The association believes that this matter concerns the safety and security of citizens. In addition to sending another letter to Chairman Du urging him to fulfill his promises, it is appropriate to submit a report on the facts of the case and request you to promptly order an investigation into the truth at the time, and then make a protest based on the facts, so that the murderer who intentionally killed cannot escape the death penalty, and so that the authorities can provide a written guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future, and issue a written apology to appease public anger and protect security. This would be a virtuous act. Respectfully submitted to Mayor Wu of the Shanghai Municipal Government.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Letter to Du Yuesheng <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Yuesheng, I respectfully write to you. Since the tragic case in Xinqiao Street occurred, we have been extremely indignant. Based on public opinion, our association made various demands and recommended Mr. Zhang to lodge a serious protest with the French authorities. We are grateful to you for speaking out righteously and immediately negotiating, which resulted in the other party accepting the promise of "severely punishing the criminals," guaranteeing that similar incidents will not occur in the future, compensating the families of the deceased, compensating the injured, expressing apologies, and canceling the ban on two people riding in the same vehicle. Considering that the families of the deceased had all come to Shanghai from afar, a long stay would inevitably result in more losses, so Liu and Zhu were instructed to each receive 2,000 yuan in compensation from the French Municipal Council so that they could quickly move the coffins back to their hometowns. Moreover, when receiving the money, Mr. Zhengzhong clearly stated that the punishment of the criminals, compensation for the injured, and the guarantee for the future must be fulfilled as promised. Unexpectedly, the newspapers recently published the French Consul's reply to the Municipal Government, which only relied on the one-sided account of the extrajudicial police officer, avoided the important and emphasized the trivial, and shirked responsibility. It was clear that he did not understand Chinese and forcibly pulled the arm of the woman riding in the vehicle, which caused voices of protest from passers-by. However, he claimed that a number of passers-by attacked him, trying to rescue the person who violated the law. It was clear that he fired live ammunition and intentionally killed people, but he claimed it was a stray bullet. The wording seemed to imply that the 2,000 yuan in compensation to the families of the deceased was enough to gloss over the matter, and the previous promise to Mr. was not mentioned at all. After reading the newspaper, the various groups were even more indignant. After a meeting, it was decided to send a letter to Mr. asking him to continue to negotiate with the French authorities, ordering them to fulfill their promises immediately, to provide a written guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future, and to issue a written apology to our government and people. The extrajudicial police officer who intentionally killed people, and how he should be severely punished according to the law, should also be clearly announced, and cannot be left vague. This matter concerns the safety and security of citizens, and this is not enough to appease public anger and reassure the people. We hope that you will continue to work hard for the sake of millions of people, and please send the results of the negotiations to the Association as soon as possible. Respectfully yours, Shanghai Various Groups Support Association for Tragic Cases in the French Concession.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Fraudulent Fundraising Has Been Going on for Over a Year <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Using the Name of the People's National Salvation Association</p>
<p>Having Raised a Total of 340 Yuan</p>
<p>Huang Jun and Another are Guilty of Heinous Crimes</p>
<p>Police Inspector Peldie (transliteration) of the French Concession Police received an anonymous letter a few days ago, stating that someone was fraudulently raising funds and extorting money in the house at No. 430 Minquan Road. On the afternoon of the previous day, he led Chinese Detective Wang Rusong to the house, arrested two people from Hunan, Huang Jun and Chen Hongfa, and seized a donation book of the People's National Salvation United Association from Huang's side. They were taken to the police station and sent to the Second Criminal Court of the Second Special District yesterday for investigation. Police Lawyer Yao Zhao Di explained the case and said that the two defendants had been fraudulently raising funds in the name of the People's National Salvation Association for more than a year, and the amount of donations had reached 340 yuan, all of which had been spent. Now that they have been discovered, they should be severely punished. When questioned, Huang Jun confessed that he was 45 years old and had been a teacher in his hometown. He lost his job two years ago and came to Shanghai last year, living at the home of his fellow villager Chen Hongying. Because he could not find a job and was hungry and cold, he had no choice but to commit this illegal act to make a living. Chen Hongying confessed that the people are the second owner, the upper room is rented out to different places, the monthly rent is five yuan, and he did not know that there was any fundraising outside. He requested a clear statement. Huang also confessed that Chen Hongfa was aware of the fundraising outside, but did not share the money. After Wu Fanglian, the judge, verified the confession, he announced that the defendants would be remanded in custody and sentenced on the morning of the 11th.</p>

<p>Cohabitation...Birth of a Daughter...Unemployment</p>
<p>Return Alone...Abandonment...Lawsuit</p>
<p>-From Union to Lawsuit-</p>
<p>Yang Zhonghe, from Songjiang, gave up his studies to become a businessman and came to Shanghai to work at the exchange. In 1927, Yang was already married, but his wife was in his hometown. He felt lonely while away from home and wanted to relieve his sexual frustration. He found no suitable partner in brothels. Later, a friend introduced him to a woman named Chen Xuemei. At that time, Chen was twenty years old and unmarried. Yang saw that she was beautiful, virtuous, and gentle. Affection grew daily, and in order to win her favor, he claimed that he was not yet married and wanted to spend the rest of his life with her. They cohabited for several months, and Chen became pregnant. She demanded that he fulfill his marriage promise as soon as possible to avoid being ridiculed by others. Yang initially made excuses, saying he would wait until after the birth, and then said he would communicate with his parents, using this as a pretext. Finally, because it was difficult to continue to postpone, he told Chen that he had a wife at home, and comforted her in every possible way, vowing that he would divorce</p>
<p>his ex-wife "Little Foreign Chicken" (the wife's name), promising a three-year period. However, by the end of 1929, Yang's exchange industry, the case wife, this place has a high cost of living, unemployed people for food, clothing, housing, self-still belong to no time, how to have the financial resources to support others, so Chen Xie gave birth to his daughter Xiao Maotou, relying on his mother's family, and he returned to Songjiang hometown, Fortunately, it is not unlearned, and it has not been idle for a long time. Later, he worked as a teacher in the county elementary school. He put Chen behind him, neither providing for him nor sending any news. Last year, Chen visited and learned that Yang had gone to Shanghai and was staying at the Far East Hotel. He took Xiao Maotou to see him, demanding support. As a result of the negotiations, Yang was willing to take Xiao Maotou home. Unexpectedly, after only one night, the next morning, he abandoned the child in the lane where Chen lived. Someone caught a glimpse and notified Chen to take her back. Until last year, Chen Xuemei felt that her youth had passed, and the girl was approaching school age. If she continued to be abandoned, not only would she be unable to make a living, but the child would also be lost. Therefore, she went to the prosecutor's office of the county court in Songjiang to file a complaint. The investigation concluded, and Yang was not prosecuted. Chen was even more disappointed. She then hired a lawyer to file a criminal self-accusation against Yang in the First Special District Court, accusing him of abduction and abandonment. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui opened the court for trial. Chen Xuemei first described in detail how she met and cohabited with Yang Zhonghe in May 1927, through an intermediary, until everything happened. Because the defendant did not arrive, the defendant's defense lawyer claimed that the defendant was originally teaching in Songjiang, and since last year when the plaintiff filed a complaint in Songjiang, his reputation has been greatly affected. The education community in Songjiang has been unable to gain a foothold, so he has now gone to a rural elementary school in Fengxian County. He came to Shanghai specifically yesterday to entrust his lawyer to defend him, and he himself has returned to school and cannot be present in court. Judge Liu then announced that the case would be adjourned until the afternoon of April 20, and the defendant would be summoned to court for trial again.</p>

They gathered for lunch first, and then the temporary chairman Xu Xiaotian announced the purpose of the meeting, briefly saying that in today's serious national crisis, it is necessary to mobilize the masses. To awaken the national salvation spirit of the masses, it is necessary to use the most stimulating art, and the art world must implement total mobilization first. Today's meeting is to unite art seniors and social celebrities to jointly organize an art and national salvation group, in order to achieve our mission in the shortest time. This is the national duty, and I hope you will give your advice. Then Wu Mai and Zhu Huiseng stood up to supplement their opinions, mainly saying that Chinese people's organizations are often all show and no substance. Today, it is a matter of course to unite the art world to save the country together, but at the beginning of the initiation, we must first have the spirit of sacrifice. If you think that this organization is not needed, you can disband it immediately. Otherwise, you must persevere to the end and strive for success. National destruction is imminent, and there is no room for superficiality. At that time, it was passed that all attendees would join as initiators. In addition, Zhu Huiseng, Wu Mai, Xu Xiaotian, Chen Dabei, Huang Jingwan, Yu Yichen, and Shen Yanjun were elected as preparatory committee members to prepare the draft of the articles of association and the task of convening the inaugural meeting.

<p>New Treatment for Meningitis: Meningitis, known as "epidemic spasm" in Chinese medicine, is gradually becoming popular in Shanghai, and is especially rampant in Wuhu. Deaths are successive, which is truly pitiable. Now, the Chinese Medicine Guidance Society, after three years of research and experimentation, has published the following opinions: (Symptoms) In the early stage, there are symptoms of cold and fever, headache like splitting, numbness in the limbs, irritability, nausea, with or without sweating. As it worsens, there are stiff neck and convulsions, opisthotonos, unclear consciousness, red and staring eyes, lockjaw and delirium. Finally, the stiff neck and opisthotonos worsen, the lips are scorched and the tongue is black, or the limbs are cold, or there is manic restlessness, or phlegm rattles and shortness of breath, or red spots are visible, or the mouth is full of erosion. (Causes) The weather is often cold and hot, and the air is turbid, brewing into an epidemic. In the early stage, it may be accompanied by cold or warmth, and over time, it stagnates and turns into heat, going up the spine and entering the brain. (Treatment) In the early stage, Gegen Tang is the main prescription, with additions and subtractions according to symptoms to relieve the symptoms. As it worsens, Lingyang and Xijiao are the main medicines, with additions and subtractions according to symptoms to clear and drain the heat. For emergency rescue, Zixue, Zhibao, and Niuhuang Xingjun Yushu pills are the main agents, used according to symptoms. The aftermath is mainly to clear the camp and support yin, and treated according to symptoms. (Formulas) Qin's Antispasmodic and Antitoxin Decoction is suitable for the early stage of epidemic spasm, with symptoms such as aversion to cold and fever. Gegen, mulberry leaves, and white peony each two qian, Chrysanthemum, Trichosanthes, Forsythia, and apricot kernels each three qian, ephedra and cinnamon each eight fen, Ledebouriella root one and a half qian. If sweating is excessive, remove ephedra. If internal heat is heavy, add one liang of reed root. Qin's Detoxifying Decoction for Epidemic Spasm is suitable for the advanced stage of epidemic spasm, with severe heat, coma, and opisthotonos. Antelope horn and yellow su each five fen, white peony and Ren Zhong Huang each two qian, Acorus tatarinowii one and a half qian, honeysuckle, Forsythia, Trichosanthes, Chrysanthemum each three qian, oyster shell and reed root each one liang. If the heat is heavy, add three fen of rhinoceros horn. If constipation, add three qian of rhubarb. If body fluid is dry, add four qian of Rehmannia glutinosa. (Note: The society is located at No. 194, Shangwen Road, inside Xiaoximen, Shanghai. The director is Mr. Qin Bowei. For any unclear points, you can directly inquire by letter, which is also good news during the epidemic).</p>

The (123) measures mentioned therein are generally consistent in principle. However, the (4th) item, "The labor side demands that the capital side subsidize wages during the strike, and it will be handled together with the treaty," is not true. I believe it is due to misinformation and I am deeply afraid of causing misunderstandings. I am writing this special letter to request a correction. Please look into it.

<h3 id="e200">A Collection of Letters Discussing the Question "Can We Go Back to the Countryside?" <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>(1) Letter from Mr. Shiyu of this city</p>
<p>I am now a small clerk in a company. Because of the threat of unemployment, I am thinking of going to the countryside like Mr. Xiongsheng. Mr. Xiongsheng's situation, with an old mother above and a wife below, makes it very difficult to find another job in the city after being unemployed, which is almost the same as my situation. Therefore, when I saw that you designed a way for Mr. Xiongsheng to return to the countryside, I was very happy, and I could follow it in the future. However, after reading your method, dark shadows still surround me. Not only is it that the lofty aspirations of "a leader standing out from the crowd" cannot inspire me, but it also shatters my fantasy of "returning to my hometown may allow me to earn a bowl of rice." According to the editor's introduction, you are an enthusiastic advocate of rural education to save the country, have a lot of research on rural education, and are also a practitioner. It seems that your views will not be wrong. Now I will write down the places where I feel disappointed with your method one by one, and ask you to explain and correct them. If you can really guide us to open up a way to survive, Mr. You, there are many young people like me and Xiongsheng in today's society, and they will be very grateful to you. (1) I cannot manage to raise one or two hundred yuan from relatives and friends in your first step. One or two hundred yuan may seem like a small amount to you, Mr. You, but it is a very large sum of money in the eyes of us poor scholars. Moreover, in such a "cold and worldly" society, let alone the fact that most people do not have wealthy relatives and friends, even if they do, they will take it to lend at interest or do something profitable for them. Who would be willing to use it to help those of us who have no way to make a living? You, Mr. You, tell us to raise money, but you don't give us a plan to repay the debt. Who would give one or two hundred yuan out of thin air? (2) Mr. Xiongsheng and I both have old mothers and wives. Your design only takes into account one person. We are not incapable of using extremely frugal methods to solve life. Waste is not associated with the poor, but rather with the inability to obtain the minimum living materials. Old mothers and wives cannot be abandoned to starve to death. Not being able to find a job means that food and shelter cannot be solved, let alone talking about what kind of clothes to wear in summer and what kind of robes to wear in winter. (3) Even if there are no above two difficulties, no burden of family members, and you can find generous relatives and friends like Mr. You, willing to lend us one or two hundred yuan, isn't it simply giving us one or two hundred yuan, can we solve personal life and lead the masses, save China? We will divide it into three sections to discuss. (1) As for the question of personal life, if we are as frugal as Mr. You instructed, one or two hundred yuan can indeed be spent in the countryside for two or three years. However, when it comes to running a school to maintain a permanent life, the problem is not that simple. Why is rural education in China so backward? Is it because intellectuals don't care to go to the countryside? Or is it that the countryside doesn't want intellectuals to set foot in it? According to Mr. You, the prerequisite for going to the countryside is something like "Do you love the countryside?" Naturally, intellectuals are unwilling to go to the countryside. I don't know what Mr. You's hometown is like, but my hometown doesn't want intellectuals. First, under the economic invasion of imperialism, my hometown went bankrupt. Because of the constant warlord wars that have resulted from the conflict between imperialism, rural economy has been extremely destroyed. Under the oppression and exploitation of disasters, wars, harsh taxes, and high interest rates, the peasants cannot even get enough to eat all year round. Where can they spare any effort to take care of their children's education? No matter how much sacrificial spirit we hold, without charging tuition, stationery, paper, books, etc., they are already overwhelmed. What's more, they have to pay a chicken, or a duck, or thirty eggs. Moreover, when children in the countryside reach school age, they are not as idle as children in the city. When they are five or six years old, they can go grazing, chopping wood, and doing all kinds of light work. Those poor and hardworking peasants don't have the same thoughts as Mr. You, telling them to sacrifice helpful children to read books that "cannot be eaten when hungry or worn when cold" is indeed a bit impossible. Second, of course, not all peasants in the countryside are completely destitute. Although wealthy landlords have run to the city, there are also middle peasants who can barely afford to provide their children with a little education. However, we must know that their future is very dark, and they are gradually moving towards destitution. Placing our career on these people, hoping to rely on these people to maintain our personal life, will inevitably lead to starvation. Third, we know that the road Mr. You is talking about is not one that no one has taken. Many previous scholars have already gone there long ago. Even in Guizhou, the province with the most backward culture, there are bound to be two or three private schools in a village where only ten farmers live. If you go to a market town with hundreds of people, there will be some small schools with signs. The countryside is withering day by day, and the population is gradually moving to the city. Under extreme poverty, does the countryside still have the power to absorb us, the intellectual class who have no way to make a living? Mr. You, do you have anything to tell me? (2) As to whether Mr. Xiongsheng can be a good leader in the countryside, I don't know Mr. Xiongsheng, but according to Xiongsheng himself, he is very humble, just a person who has no special skills and can only write a few words. I am indeed just a person with no special skills. Do Mr. You and Mr. Xiongsheng know each other? I think it's probably not. If Mr. Xiongsheng had known Mr. You earlier, he must have been guided by Mr. You to go to the countryside. Why would he still write a letter asking the reader advisor column's reporter to solve his own problems? So how does Mr. You know that Mr. Xiongsheng can be a leader in the countryside? If anyone who can write can be a leader in the countryside, can I do it too? Can those scholars of the previous dynasty do it too? Mr. You, you are a person who advocates rural education. What conditions do you think a rural teacher should have? What do we take to teach children in the countryside? How do we lead those peasants under double oppression? (3) As for the question of whether rural education can save the country, I am not an educator and I don't understand. However, I always feel that the organization of society is fundamentally based on economics. If there is no way to solve the economy, politics will be chaotic. Under a poor economy and chaotic politics, all construction is empty talk, all deception, and cultural undertakings are no exception. And to have hope for China's economic future, sweeping away imperialism and all its parasitic forces is the only prerequisite? Everything else is nonsense. However, Mr. You thinks that rural education can save the country. Because I trust the editor's introduction, I also want to listen to your high views. In short, can we really go back to the countryside in China now? Can the countryside be revived? Can rural education really save China? Is it the only way out for Chinese youth to take on rural education? Please give me an answer, Mr. You. As for the issues of running cooperatives and conducting village governance, I would like to leave it to those who have studied it to discuss. I will not get involved.</p>

<h3 id="e201">Tang Erhu <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>A businessman who returned from Shenyang felt extremely saddened by the fall of Chengde, believing that it had let down the hopes of the 30 million people outside the pass!</p>
<p>The people outside the pass, especially the merchants, were all eagerly awaiting good news from the war. They believed that the enemy had declared their attack on Rehe for over a year. They thought that young commander Zhang would hold the resentment of "not living under the same sky as the killer of his father," and Tang Erhu, who was defending Rehe, was a man of bravery and spirit, of whom the old commander was afraid by three points even in his lifetime. With thorough deployments, how could the enemy easily invade? There was even hope of recovering Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang. Who knew that before long, Japanese newspapers had already widely reported the victory in the invasion of Rehe: that a small team of over a hundred men easily captured Chengde, and that only one person died and two were injured in the attack on Gubeikou. They all shook their heads in disbelief, thinking that it was a false propaganda by the Japanese. Taking advantage of Mr. So-and-so's return home, they entrusted him to find out the truth about the war and report it to them, so that they could dispel their doubts.</p>
<p>After Mr. So-and-so returned, the facts told him that they were speaking with the same tongue as the propaganda in the Japanese newspapers! Tang Erhu had fled! Young commander Zhang had gone south! Such inauspicious news, if written in a letter to inform the compatriots outside the pass, wouldn't it close the door of their hope? Wouldn't it open the floodgates of their tears?</p>
<p>Whether young commander Zhang will avenge himself or not? Let's put that aside for now and wait for the next installment. Some people say that this Tang Erhu, who was always known for his bravery and who the old commander was afraid of by three points, has inevitably tainted the fine name of "Erhu." It is commonly said that someone with abundant strength is called "nine oxen and two tigers." Does he deserve to be called "Erhu?" It would be better to call him "One Crab"; he fled before the enemy even reached the city, and compared to other fleeing generals, he can be said to be "one crab is worse than another." It would be better to call him "One Duck"; his anti-Japanese telegram was so generous and tragic. It fits the saying "a duck in a soup pot, only the mouth comes out." Moreover, his desertion has already been confirmed, and he has also sent a telegram saying that he wants to take back Chengde, so it can be seen that his duck mouth is still not softened. Calling him "Tang One Duck" is more consistent with his name and reality.</p>
<p>Some people say: Tang Erhu is a tiger internally, not externally. He is indeed a tiger who eats people without spitting out bones to the common people, but towards the dwarf tiger, he becomes not a tiger but a "rat" that flees with its head in its hands. According to this, he can also be called Tang One Rat.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Restoration <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Bai He</p>
<p>Being an emperor is the noblest and most enjoyable profession in the world. Within a country, one is supreme, able to do as one pleases. If the emperor says that farts are fragrant, who would dare wrinkle their nose and frown. Because being an emperor is simply the most comfortable thing, even dogs and cats, Da Liuzi and Xiao Sanzi, although possessing a demeanor unfit for such a position, would still claim to have the appearance of an emperor in their death throes, dreaming of the imperial throne. However, I, observing the situation, feel that in this current era, being an emperor is not very enjoyable. Today, one may be solemnly receiving the congratulations of thousands of subjects, but in the middle of the night, a revolution erupts, and before dawn, one might be dragged out of a warm bed by revolutionaries and exiled to a deserted island.</p>
<p>The emperor who has broken his imperial rice bowl does not suffer the pain of being cut in two or beheaded to be displayed to the public, but merely lives in exile on a deserted island or lives in hiding in a foreign country. This is because his five elements and eight characters are good, at least he has a Violet Emperor star shining on his life, so breaking his imperial rice bowl is only a temporary period of hiding his light and nourishing his strength. One day, a trapped dragon gains water, and can still stir up wind and waves, make a comeback, and regain the dragon throne, calling himself lonely.</p>
<p>It is said that everything in the world cannot escape the cycle of creation, the circle of heaven and earth, yin and yang. When Tai reaches its extreme, there is obstruction, and when obstruction reaches its extreme, there is Tai. People are always tumbling in this. The political trends of various countries are also like this. When autocratic politics reaches its peak, it inevitably comes down to democratic politics. Democratic politics expand into a swelling disease, leading to a system of socialism. When the socialist system becomes a semi-paralyzed person, then "you are bad, overthrow you, I will do it," the stage turns, the supporting actors come on stage, the deposed emperor is restored, and a scene of dictatorial politics is staged. Thus, the emperor, who has been unemployed for a long time, finds his imperial rice bowl again. Although it is not certain whether this newly arranged restoration comedy will sell out or be booed by the audience, keeping an actor with the appearance of an emperor and a Violet Emperor star shining on his life will inevitably itch for a genuine show.</p>

<p>The spring maiden has finally bashfully arrived in Jiangnan. The serene countryside is adorned with nature's beauty, so the red flowers bloom as usual, and the birds sing actively on the branches. The gentlemen and young ladies in the city, attracted by the universe's love and nurture, shout, "Spring has arrived! It's time for picnics! Let's have a picnic!" Oh, you leisurely people! We don't need you to come.</p>
<p>Are you coming to seek amusement from the songs of field poets? Are you coming to breathe fresh air after being tired of city life for so long? Go away! The countryside has been hurt by you. From now on, we will never let the stench of capitalism rush into the countryside again!</p>
<p>Pitifully, we don't have a single silver dollar on us. Pitifully, our accumulated hard work has only earned us broken scars. It is you who have absorbed our money, it is you who have exported our money overseas! And you still want to talk about going to the countryside? There are no suits and leather shoes in the countryside! Look! Our plain clothes and simple meals!</p>
<p>You only know how to enjoy yourselves, you don't know the hardships of the world. When you see a fisherman fishing by the stream, you say, "What a quiet and meaningful game!" Do you know that one day's harvest is not enough to feed a family? Enough! You always come to destroy our countryside, go away! People full of the stench of capitalism.</p>
<p>We have our own gardens, our green hills and clear waters belong to the public, our field life is communal, our spring is beautiful, but we absolutely don't need you to transform it. The countryside is fundamentally primitive!</p>

<h3 id="e205">Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Four: The Affair Rekindles at the Teahouse, Accumulated Feelings; the Year-End is Hard to Get Through, the Pawnshop Laments</p>
<p>When Jiang received that big bowl of stewed beef from the Zhao family that day, she felt a great stimulation in her heart. She thought to herself, if my child were a son, wouldn't he be just like this, able to stew a big bowl of beef for me to eat? But then she thought, there are many people in the world who rely on their sons to support them in old age, but how many sons who support them are able to stew beef for their parents? There are two old people on this street who rely on their sons, but the sons all wear good clothes and eat good food, while the old people are pitifully poor. So it seems that saying that having a son means having someone to rely on in old age is not very reliable. It's really unnecessary to have a son like Zhao Company Commander. Even having a son-in-law like him would be satisfying. I think the Zhao father and son are so kind and thoughtful to my family, could it be that they want to propose marriage to my family? And judging from my daughter's attitude, she has always looked down on soldiers, but she always says good things about this Zhao Company Commander, whether in person or behind his back. Could it be that this child has Zhao Company Commander in her heart? As she thought this, she felt it was more and more likely. Taking this opportunity to settle her daughter's lifelong affair would also be the responsibility of a parent. Having made up her mind, that evening, she sat on the kang with Guizhi, sharing a kerosene lamp while sewing clothes. The mother and daughter chatted idly, and Guizhi asked again if the beef was delicious. Jiang lowered her head and kept holding the clothes in her hand, threading the needle and sewing busily. She seemed to be paying little attention to her daughter, casually replying: How could it not be delicious? How many times a year does our family get to eat it? Guizhi said: That's what I thought too. Our family doesn't have days when we eat meat, so when Old Master Zhao sent it to me, I didn't refuse and brought it back. Jiang said: Yes! The old master saw that our family was poor, so he sent us this bowl of beef. Both he and his son have good hearts. As she said this, she raised her head slightly, her eyes hidden behind her glasses, and glanced at Guizhi. Seeing that Guizhi was still calmly sewing clothes, she added: Zhao Company Commander is an even better person.</p>
<p>Being a company commander, I wonder how much money he can earn in a month! (36)</p>
<h3 id="e206">Foot Massage <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Qing</p>
<p>Having a foot massage in a bathhouse has a special flavor. Wrapped in a large towel or bathrobe, you lie back on the kang bed, stretching your feet straight out, placing them on the knees of the foot massager sitting on a low stool. You close your eyes and concentrate, or smoke a cigarette, letting him massage your feet. If the massage is neither itchy nor painful, but instead makes your soles feel a little itchy, then you must slightly raise your head and gently say to the foot massager: "Harder!" The foot massager uses a little more force, and this wave of pleasure makes you "float like an immortal rising to heaven." At this moment, your eyes will become hazy, and perhaps the corners of your mouth will automatically stretch to the sides of your face, indicating that you are currently experiencing this wave of numbness and tasting a part of the pleasure of the flesh. However, once this wave of pleasure passes, I'm sorry, your soles have been massaged until the skin is broken, and you feel pain in your soles. You suffer this pain, it's self-inflicted; you can't get angry and blame the foot massager for being too heavy-handed. You can only raise your head slightly for the second time, put on a "that's enough" expression, and gently say to the foot massager: "That's enough!" Seeing that your soles are broken and bloody, with traces of blood seeping into the broken towel, the foot massager immediately sprinkles powder to cover it up, without saying anything else.</p>
<p>Recently, Yosuke Matsuoka, the chief representative of Japan at the League of Nations, gave a speech to Japanese expatriates during his trip to Chicago, saying these two sentences: "We will use force only when necessary." All 400 million compatriots in China, please look! That's all there is to it, without saying anything else.</p>

<h3 id="e207">In Praise of Children <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Ming</p>
<p>"Children," "Children," what a fragrant, sweet, and tenderly soft pleasing noun this is! Children, children, what a group of energetic activists full of enthusiasm, brightness, and upward spirit!</p>
<p>From a broader perspective! Children are the future masters of the country, the central point of cultural transmission, and also the pivotal point for transitioning from the current century to the utopian and blissful century of the future.</p>
<p>To use an analogy; Children are like sparkling stars in the night, and also like dazzling lightning illuminating the globe. They are like softly flowing water flowing eastward, and also like tender buds of vegetation sprouting. They are like flower buds, and also like angels in imagination 丨丨丨 little angels.</p>
<p>Children are the sparkling sparks in everyone's life, the heart and soul of everyone, an invisible stimulant in everyone's life, and also an element in everyone's life, a living treasure and a lifeline for everyone. They are also the lively masters with sound, color, and form among mankind; without children, there would be no world. Children are the only comforters of people's souls, without children, it would be tantamount to declaring one's own life a death sentence, like those intellectual celibates, the virgins, who are themselves executing themselves as representatives of prisoners serving "life imprisonment."</p>
<p>The current physical health of children is a symbol of the future physical health of adults; the current mental health of children is an omen of the future soundness of knowledge, ethnicity, and career.</p>
<p>The hearts of children are more pure than snowflakes, they are the purest; without the hypocrisy, cunning, and exaggeration of adults, stained with heavy pigments; almost stained beyond recognition, burying their own childlike innocence and losing their original appearance.</p>
<p>Children are uncrowned emperors, jumping and leaping, talking and laughing, crying and yelling, very free and very equal. The actions of children are very natural! Very grand! Very beautiful! When they are hungry, they cry out loud; when they are full, they fart and shit regardless of whether they are in public or before a king, unlike adults who say human words in front of people and ghost words behind their backs.</p>
<p>They can't reach the magpie's nest in the tree branches, but they insist on trying. They climb with both hands and feet like monkeys. After only a few feet, they fall down, but children have a determined spirit of perseverance! One day, two days, they finally climb up!</p>
<p>Children are the most content, the most adventurous, and the most fearless; "Good boy! Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!" He doesn't believe it, he touches it with his finger and cries! From then on, he dares not again! Afterwards, he increases his belief in the words of adults!</p>
<p>The life of childhood is the happiest life in life. When they are happy, they roll and roll, walk and walk, run and run, jump and jump; when they are tired, they not only sleep in a cradle, but also lie in their mother's arms. When they grow up, they fly kites in the spring, go to the park in the summer, tread on fragrant grass and play games, or flutter through the woods like butterflies; they fish in the autumn, chase chickens, or lie in a pile of sorghum stalks and bask in the sun; they huddle around the stove for warmth at home in the winter.</p>
<p>However, children with faces full of mud, hawking along the streets, are children; children being beaten by their uncles, scolded by their aunts, and laughed at by their siblings are also children. Children with ragged clothes and thin bones are children, children who are illiterate and dull-witted are children; children who are lifeless during festivals are children, children with eccentric personalities and strange behaviors are also children; children who cry without tears when they see people and reach out their hands when they meet people are children, children who are hopping on one foot, bending over, jumping like dogs, and dancing like monkeys are also children; children who are barefoot and sweating under the scorching sun in the city in the summer, shouting, "It's cool! Buy ice!" are children; children who are carrying broken baskets to pick up dry branches in the winter are also children, children in the countryside who carry a small shovel on a long pole, driving a flock of sheep up the mountains to greet the sunrise and send off the sunset, are children, children who are chattering their teeth and shivering, sifting blue coal (second-generation coal) in the sand like panning for gold are also children. Children! Children! There are all kinds of good things, and also all kinds of bad things; there are all kinds of luck, and also all kinds of bad luck. It is the fault of the parents, and also the crime of society; it is the poison of feudal inheritance, and even more so the unending responsibility of today's intellectuals and those who hold political authority.</p>

<h3 id="e208">Political Power and Civil Rights <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Lianfu</p>
<p>Recently, the newspapers have been clamoring about a speech by an old Kuomintang comrade who has been traveling north and south, saying that the government has made a firm decision to open up political power. ?</p>
<p>To open up political power, as guessed by us ordinary people who have never tasted the taste of political power, probably means that everyone shares the food and everyone becomes an official. From now on, there will be peace in the world, and everyone will have a future. You don't have to fight, and I don't have to make a fuss. We will gather together in harmony, hang up the national flag, and put on our belts. Poets must prepare to become poetry officials, and novelists will have to become minor officials. It is said that the women of Peiping have already caught up and become female patrol officers. In this way, everyone becomes an official, and externally, we will jointly face national difficulties, and internally, we will prepare for constitutionalism - these four characters also caused a sensation during the Guangxu reign of the Manchu Qing Dynasty - steam my hair, bind you with a good title, heroes of the world, enter my snare, wouldn't that be grand, wouldn't that be delightful.</p>
<p>But upon careful thought, we have 400 million compatriots. No matter how much you increase the number of committee members and parliamentarians, it probably won't accommodate 400 million black-hatted officials. Moreover, the capable are burdened with more work, and those who are close to the people must at least concurrently hold seventeen or eighteen prominent positions. The yamen is wide open, the constitution is written on paper, calling a beggar to play the role of a spring official, a dream of Handan, and the two hundred big boards that follow are truly unbearable. Therefore, we poor bones who are used to being poor should consolidate our civil rights as soon as possible, which is more practical.</p>
<p>I think that if political power is to be opened up, why should civil rights be so closed off? A copy of Ma's Grammar can actually be used as evidence of endangering the Republic of China, and a novel lamenting poverty can even constitute a death sentence for a journalist. In addition, there are countless other political suspects who don't eat mutton and have a slightly muttony smell. Even a memorial gathering for deceased sages must be reported early and can only be implemented after approval. There are truly many such facts, too many to remember. I think that if political power is to be opened up, why must civil rights be so tightly closed off?</p>
<h3 id="e209">Sanfu the Tailor <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Peng Xuezhen</p>
<p>Outside it was cold wind, cold rain, cold air. Inside the house it was gloomy, the weak light of a small oil lamp trembled in the dark. Sanfu lay on the bedding stuffed with straw, coughing and panting, his forehead covered in sweat, his face oily, and messy black stubble around his mouth, his small eyes squeezed even smaller by his tightly furrowed brows.</p>
<p>Although he was already forty-six or forty-seven years old, this was the first time in his life that he had been sick in bed for three or four days. He knew how to "endure", refusing to lie down until he really couldn't hold on any longer; this time, he really couldn't control himself. Although at first he adopted a "let it go" attitude and endured for a day or two, in the end he finally lay down.</p>
<p>From the age of eight or nine, he had been taking needles and thread in a tailor shop as an apprentice, and he didn't know how many times he had eaten shoe soles (been bullied), leaving a scar more than an inch long on his forehead to this day. Because of this, after Sanfu finally managed to become the shopkeeper, he never beat his apprentices.</p>
<p>Although he became the shopkeeper, Sanfu's hard and poor fate didn't change much. And because he started a family, the heavy burden of life pressed him down even more.</p>
<p>The year before last was even more unlucky, when his wife unexpectedly died, leaving him with a daughter who wasn't even a month old in addition to two boys, one eight and one nine years old. Sanfu was so heartbroken that he had no tears, just staring at the sky in a daze. The coffin bill wasn't paid off until the Mid-Autumn Festival last year, and he almost got beaten by the bill collector.</p>
<p>After his wife died, Sanfu's life seemed to have lost its purpose, and he had no energy for anything. But when he thought of the children his wife had left behind, he could only sew even more diligently and run even more diligently on the streets.</p>
<p>Although there were many people who wanted Sanfu to make clothes, it was really hard to bear the expressions on their faces when he stretched out his hand to ask for payment once the clothes were made! Although the price he charged was fairer than other tailors, people always glared at him: "Come and get it at the festival, I won't cheat you!" But when it came time to collect the money at the festival, they would say: "Come and get it next festival, will I run away?"</p>
<p>Although the customers' wages were always delayed, the wages of the workers couldn't be delayed. Every month, Sanfu didn't know how many nice things he had to say and how much thought he had to put in to get by. When it came to days when they ate meat, he never forgot to buy half a catty more meat to treat the workers, so that everyone would be more energetic.</p>
<p>What he feared most was the finger-numbing winter, when the work was particularly slow, but the people who wore the clothes couldn't wait to have them today if they were cut tomorrow. Sanfu had heard enough of the customers' fierce instructions, so he repeatedly begged Old Wang and Old Li to work overtime, offering three cents when they wouldn't agree for two, and he himself accompanied them, sewing even harder. But when he finished and delivered the clothes, the customer still said that they were made too coarsely and that he would get the money at the end of the year. Sanfu could only complain; I sewed these with sleepy eyes!</p>
<p>At this time, the sound of two children snoring filled the house. He remembered: Didn't Dabao clamor for a new robe yesterday? People laughed at Dabao, how come his dad is a tailor and he still doesn't dress neatly? Yes, he just can't save another dollar this month. Erbao had to pay some fees, saying that there would be a meeting tomorrow to buy snacks, and last night he begged Erbao; "Good boy, can you not go to school tomorrow?" Erbao cried for half an hour clutching his quilt for this reason. Xiaomao's breastfeeding money was also being forced to be paid, three dollars a month, enough to bear!</p>
<p>Now he himself had fallen ill, unable to work and still having to spend money to see a doctor and buy medicine. Who could he blame? He was too presumptuous, working for three days and nights without taking a nap to rush Old Grandpa Qin's shroud, and he got sick before he got the money. Coughing, wheezing, unable to move his waist and back, feeling pain as if he was clamping a bullet, his shoulders always aching as if they were about to break. But, in this deep night, he didn't dare to groan loudly, fearing that he would wake the workers from their good sleep and they wouldn't be able to work tomorrow.</p>
<p>Sanfu was tired, panting softly, calculating in a daze the rice and firewood for tomorrow, Dabao's new jacket, Erbao's two-cent fee...</p>
<p>When will this bitter fate end!</p>
<h3 id="e210">Tolstoy on Women <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Jingxie</p>
<p>Among many literary figures, Tolstoy can be considered one of the most frequent to mention women. Whether in essays, in plays or novels, he always used a stern and cold attitude to criticize the current social system, and used a generous tone to defend innocent women. In "Kreutzer Sonata" he said: "······Those coercive means (coercive means to cure syphilis) are not used to eliminate lust but to encourage lust; guaranteeing that lust is not dangerous, what is that? Almost no one does not encounter that terrible thing, not to mention young people, I am afraid that nine out of ten have suffered this pain, even the farmers in the countryside cannot be spared. The reason for this is not because women have bewitching means, women will never bewitch people; it is because some people regard lust as legal, beneficial to health, and some people regard it as a most natural and not at all sinful game for young people.······</p>
<p>In fact, Tolstoy, in daily conversation, would utter a torrent of wonderful theories about women as soon as he discussed them. Once he met Gorky and talked about women's chastity, taking the short story "Twenty-Six Men and a Girl" written by Gorky as the topic. Tolstoy said: "Chastity"? This is certainly unnatural for ladies who are healthy and fully developed. Women over the age of fifteen, if she is healthy and fully developed, then she must be very happy to be touched and embraced by the opposite sex in her heart! However, on the other hand, she is very worried in her mind about something she does not understand and has not experienced: the concept of so-called "chastity," "purity," and "flawlessness" lies in this point. However, no matter how worried she is in her heart, her flesh always thinks that this thing she has not fully understood is a legitimate and legal behavior, so she constantly asks her to fulfill this law!"</p>
<p>Once, when he was walking with Chekhov, he suddenly opened his mouth and asked Chekhov: "Hey! Old brother! You must have had a lot of fun whoring when you were young!" Chekhov did not answer, but chuckled with a wry smile. Tolstoy looked at the sea again, as if lost in thought, and said: "In fact, I also like women very much and never get tired of them!" On another occasion, Gorky, Chekhov, and others were talking about women, and Tolstoy sat beside them listening attentively for a long time before he opened his mouth and said: "The truth about women? I'll tell you when one of my feet steps into the grave! At that time, after I say it, I want to jump into the coffin immediately, hurriedly put the coffin lid on, and then shout: "Hey! Do as you please!"</p>

<p>Some people say that childhood is a golden age, it is like a rose in spring, in full bloom, it flourishes in gentle love, it does not know what is called sadness in the world!</p>
<p>But our Linlin is completely different, he was born and grew up in pain, his father is a street sweeper, his mother is a disabled woman!</p>
<p>When he was ten years old, he was oppressed by life, spending his youth in a dark factory, working all day long without stopping, and the reward he got was only cold and hunger!</p>
<p>It was in this environment that he gradually grew up, the factory turned him into iron bones and copper tendons, and his tenacious character was also formed here, he constantly uttered angry cries!</p>
<p>He understood that to live, he could only struggle, and only a strong team could have a strong force. He called on the masses to rise from hell! But alas, he finally went to the "slaughterhouse"!</p>
<p>Now, although his body has become dust, his name is still engraved in the hearts of some people! He grew up in sorrow and pain! He died in a tragic war!</p>

<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>So people imagine those ferocious imperialist lackeys - the informers and patrolmen of the concession, beasts who specialize in sucking the blood of compatriots. In addition, there are foreign beasts, especially the patrolmen in the Hongkou area, strutting along North Sichuan Road, grinning at the Chinese with ashen faces on both sides of the road. Although he hated them, he was also afraid of them. The day before yesterday, in the branch, a comrade gave such an impassioned speech, saying that rather than being slowly slaughtered to death by them, those imperialists, it would be better to fight them and their lackeys to the death one day sooner, which would be more enjoyable. Individual life originally has little meaning. Our comrades must fight for society, and fight for the lives of the broad masses of poor people. There is no meaning in sitting in a pavilion reading socialist books and writing socialist articles. We need action, - we need revolutionary action!</p>
<p>At that time, Haiquan's enthusiasm was indeed stirred up by the speech of this committee member, and he applauded with the crowd, and he wanted to immediately go to the forefront of anti-imperialism.</p>
<p>Later, a vote was taken to participate in the demonstration parade, and it was unanimously approved. But after the meeting, when he came out and was blown by the cold wind on the street, Haiquan's enthusiasm disappeared to who knows where.</p>
<p>"This is an adventure! A very dangerous adventure!"</p>
<p>So he thought of Mrs. Tsuruko again, thought of Peizhu, thought of Zhuo Shuhua, and even thought of Mrs. Cao Shiguang, and then thought of his old grandmother and parents living in the southern countryside. From his parents at home, he thought of the money that had not yet been remitted home.</p>
<p>"Do it! Go forward bravely and do it! A good Chinese man should not be so cowardly! This is the work that Chinese youth cannot shirk - the work of liberating the Chinese nation, and the work of finding a way out for the broad masses of poor people"!</p>
<p>He was daydreaming while holding this letter. He imagined the scene when he was pulled into the police station by the patrol. He also remembered the pain in prison that the advanced people who had lived in the Western prison had told him about. He was a little scared again.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin, where did the letter come from, you're reading it with such enthusiasm, is it a love letter"?</p>
<p>Qiuying walked forward holding a child, smiling at him. Her face was almost leaning on one of his arms. He smelled a fragrance again. For a long time, he didn't open his mouth, just glanced at her quickly and couldn't help but smile.</p>
<p>"Can I see it?"</p>
<p>She asked him with a red face and a smile.</p>
<p>"You can't understand it".</p>
<p>He smiled and tucked the letter into his pocket.</p>

<h3 id="e213">Financial and Exchange Market Extremely Tight, Benchmark Gold Price Reaches New High <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>－$1,118－</p>
<p>Increasing Momentum with an Advance of $10.08</p>
<p>The gold market's bullish trend continues unabated. Yesterday saw a new high of $1,118. In the early morning, Reuters reported that spot and forward London bar gold both rose slightly by 0.0625, while New York silver prices fell slightly, with forward silver prices down just over 0.03. Although not much, given the current market sentiment, it was considered satisfactory. Bank private cables reduced by 0.3125, and American cotton also fell by 2 points. Early trading in wool was slightly lower, at $0.34, but market sentiment was very stable, and buyers showed considerable interest. The opening price was therefore $1,107. The exchange market opened with British exchange flat and American exchange slightly loose. There was no upward momentum at the start, initially falling from $0.08 to $0.045. Although no transactions occurred in the exchange market, the trend was very good, gradually rising. Later, banks showed no desire to sell, and attempts to close positions failed. Dealers rushed to buy, and HSBC initially posted a small reduction of 0.125 for British exchange and 0.25 for American exchange. The exchange market was extremely tight, and the bullish trend was strong. Finally, HSBC posted further reductions of 0.125 and 0.25. Market conditions were extremely brisk. US dollar holdings in July were previously traded at $28.6875, but then rose to $1,118. Later, banks slightly resisted, and the market temporarily hardened. There were slight rumors regarding the current situation, and a decline was observed, but it quickly returned to stability. Trading within the market seemed narrow, leading to slight market volatility. The closing price was $1,116.50, with speculation adding $18. Swap premiums continued to decrease, approximately between $0.04 and $0.07. The market situation for the half-day is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was $1,107, an increase of $1.03 from the previous closing. Goods also opened at $0.07. Recent exchange market openings saw British exchange at 1 shilling 8 pence 0.0625, and American exchange at $28.625, slightly firmer than the previous closing. However, market sentiment was stable, and prices rose from $0.068 to $0.08. But due to Hengyu, Zhaofeng, Changda, and Decheng rushing to sell, prices fell to $0.045. Fuchang came in to buy, raising prices to over $0.07. Others further purchased, and prices rose to over $0.09. Although prices slightly declined due to goods being sold, market sentiment was extremely stable. The exchange market was fiercely tight. July US dollars at 0.0625, June at 0.8125, and current month at 0.5 were all difficult to close. Banks showed no intention to sell. Qianchangxiang and Hengyu rushed to buy, and prices surged to over $0.10, reaching $0.11. Ruixing and Shunli slightly sold, bringing prices down to $0.09. At this time, goods were still being sold, and Xingye sold to Wah Bi June US dollars at 0.875. Hongli came in to buy, continuing to drive up prices. Hengxing also bought, and prices surged to $0.13, slightly declining thereafter. However, with the announcement of HSBC's postings, British exchange down 0.125 and American exchange down 0.25, Qianchangxiang advanced to $0.04. Citibank had previously sought July US dollars at $29. Hengyu and Fuyu advanced to over $0.05. Yuankangxiang and Qianchangxiang further increased, rising to $0.065. Hongli, Zhifeng, and Yongyi also bought, as banks needed to close positions for May US dollars at 0.5. Daxingyong then sold, and Fuyu also sold. Zhongfu resisted July US dollars at 0.75, and prices retreated to $0.04. Zhaofengchang continued to increase, and July US dollars at 0.75 were already difficult to close. Daxingyong suddenly came in to buy, and the trend was extremely strong. Banks had sought July US dollars at $0.6875. HSBC revised its postings twice, British exchange down 0.125 and American exchange down 0.25. Market sentiment greatly improved, and prices surged to $1,118. Goods were relatively low, so hedgers all sold, gradually retreating to $0.055. Ruixing suddenly advanced, reaching $0.068. Yuanshengyong slightly sold, and the market became volatile, retreating to $0.04. Mcalister bought July US dollars at $0.6875. Hengyu and Yuankangxiang traded back and forth, improving to $0.075. Zhifengyong and Hengyu suddenly sold, market conditions became chaotic, and there was slight volatility. Finally, Wah Bi released May US dollars at 0.375, and Fuchang aggressively sold, leading to a downward trend. June US dollars at 0.625 and July at 0.8125 banks were willing to sell. Chunyuanyong also sold, and retail investors further pushed down, retreating from $0.066 to $0.012. Market sentiment remained good, and market conditions were stable. June US dollars at 0.625 banks suddenly demanded, and Fuchang returned to advance to over $0.04. Before long, June US dollars at 0.625 became difficult to close, and Richang also bought, reaching over $0.05. Qianchangxiang also advanced, and prices surged again to $0.079. Hedgers continued to sell, so prices retreated to the afternoon closing of $1,116.50. Goods were slightly higher, priced at $0.07, as buyers continued to surge in after the market closed. The highest price for the half-day was $1,118, and the lowest price was $1,104.50, a difference of $13.50. The result was an increase of $10.08 compared to the previous closing. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday.</p>
<p>The quoted price was reduced by half a dollar in total due to HSBC's American exchange postings, calculated at $28, equivalent to a gold price of $1,198.80. Based on the closing price, telegrams were shorted approximately $82, more than $10 more than the previous closing. (The shilling quoted price was 824.17). The current month's ledger price was $1.123, May was $1.117, and the morning supplementary payment was $1.121.</p>
<p>Market transactions: In summary, Hengyu, Qianchangxiang, Hengxing, Fuyu, Yuankangxiang, Richang, Hongli, and Yuanchunbing all advanced goods hedges. Fuchang, Chunyuanyong, Tongfengheng, Dafengheng, and Zhifengyong all sold. Zhaofengchang, Dachangdacheng, Ruixing, and Daxingyong all initially sold and then advanced. Zhifengyong and Hengyu initially advanced and then sold. Dalian businesses did not trade much, and Guangdong businesses were also few. The total number of May notes up to the previous day was 20,125.</p>
<p>April public notes: 35 notes were released by Yingfenghheng, 21 notes were collected by Tongfenghheng, and 7 notes each by Runchangyong and Runchangyu, totaling 35 notes collected and released.</p>
<p>Speculation was slightly lower. The initial opening was calculated at an additional $18, but Tianjin businesses sold to Yingfenghheng at $19. Later, the price was cheaply made down to $17.50, still from Tianjin businesses, as term benchmarks rose and swaps were favorable. Spot numbers still came in to increase and make swaps.</p>
<p>Swap premiums continued to be small. Dachengde paid Yingfenghheng 105 notes at $0.068, and another 35 notes at $0.06. Later, a further 21 notes were paid to Yingfenghheng, reduced to $0.045, and 7 notes were paid to Qianchangxiang at $0.042. (Goods initially opened from number 15 paying to number 77 at $0.09, but only 7 notes were transacted. Number 57 paid to number 77 70 notes at $0.05). There were still 4,375 April notes remaining.</p>

<p>Banks Unwilling to Supply</p>
<p>The Trend is Particularly Tight</p>
<p>According to Reuters yesterday, London long-term bills rose by 0.0625, both near and far-term. The British to American exchange rate was unchanged, and the American to British exchange rate was slightly lower by 0.0625. The recent British exchange rate opened flat, calculated at 1 shilling 8 pence 0.0625 (16.731). New York silver was down 0.25, and private telegrams were down 0.3125. The five-metal exchange's forward silver price fell by 0.034. Market sentiment was relatively good. The American exchange rate opened at 28.625 (4.885), slightly looser by 0.0625 compared to the previous closing. Although there were few transactions after opening, the trend was particularly tight. The current month's American dollar, even at 0.5, was difficult to close. June at 0.8125 and July at 0.0625 both lacked sellers. Banks showed no intention of releasing. July's American dollar at 28.875, banks began to show slight resistance, but tightened again soon after. Banks initially released 0.75, and the surge to seek July at 0.6875 was extremely intense. This was the most tense moment, in fact due to HSBC's postings repeatedly reducing, calculated at a total reduction of 0.25 for shillings and a small half-dollar for the American exchange rate. The trend was extraordinarily tight. Although it briefly loosened after entering, banks were willing to resist June's American dollar at 0.625 and July's American dollar at 0.8125, it was a fleeting moment. Before long, banks sought to close June's American dollar at 0.625 but failed, still entering a favorable situation. By the afternoon closing, the recent asking price for British exchange was 1 shilling 7 pence 8125 (16.942), tighter by 0.25 compared to the previous closing, and the American exchange rate was 28.1875 (4.962), tighter by 0.375 compared to the previous closing. Banking circles such as Mitsui, Heifeng, and Wah Bi were all sellers. HSBC resisted shillings, and Citibank slightly sought American exchange. Counterparts (gold merchants) were still seeking to close positions. The bank's advances and retreats for the half-day are recorded below.</p>
<p>British exchange opened in the morning with a recent asking price of 1 shilling 8 pence 0.0625 (16.731). Zhengjin sold to Wah Bi the current month at 1 shilling 8 pence.

<p>Price Drops Five to Nine Dimes</p>
<p>Only 1918 Bonds Remain Good, Rising Two Dimes and Five Points</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange's public debt market suddenly saw an unexpected reversal. According to common psychology, there were no special news reports, so the morning opening continued the previous day's bullish momentum and continued to rise. 1918 customs bonds and disbandment bonds both rose by 3-4 dimes, and 1918 customs bonds alone rose by 2 dimes. The situation could be called good. Starting from 1919 bonds, numbers 38 and 45, and so on, saw a lot of selling, and increasingly so. Although 1919 bonds had not yet fallen, starting from 1919 good bonds, the market gradually felt weak. After entering, the decline became increasingly severe, with the larger drops falling by as much as one dollar. It was said that it was due to newspapers again spreading rumors. Large accounts were coming out of the cage. The secondary market caused the primary market to initially rise and then fall, resulting in the secondary market initially falling and then rising, barely reaching equilibrium. In the afternoon, market sentiment still failed to rally. Retail investors sold at the opening, and market prices fell uniformly by 2-3 dimes. Closing prices were relatively stable, but still did not escape the image of flatness and fatigue. The result of the day's market price was another drop of 5-6 dimes to 9 dimes or so. Only the 1918 bonds still rose by 2 dimes and 5 points. The total number of transactions was $8,204,000, including $4,000 in spot and $8,200,000 in futures. Among them, consolidated salt tax accounted for $2,760,000, disbandment bonds accounted for $1,400,000, 20-volume and 20-customs bonds were all over $1,000,000, and the rest ranged from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands.</p>

<p>－Speculators Are Liquidating, and Spot Sales Have Turned Flat－</p>
<p>The yarn market suddenly fell, and the situation softened again. Due to rising for many days, it triggered profit-taking liquidations. As for customer sales, they had purchased a lot in these few days, and yesterday they also turned sluggish. Therefore, market sentiment softened, and sellers reappeared. A selling trend suddenly arose, and the market plate fell. However, the issue of reducing working hours is feared to be implemented. Currently, with the available chips still being sufficient, the market still has pressure. Later, the decline may be less.</p>

Term futures fell by 1 to 3 points, and spot fell by 5 points. British cotton futures rose by 4 points, and spot rose by 6 points. Egyptian cotton spot rose by 3 points. Indian cotton rose due to the rise in American cotton, good market sentiment, and eager buying. Pingguoer rose by 3.25 rupees, and Aomula and Bailuo Creek rose by 5 rupees.

<p>Counterparts Have Been Absorbing, While Southern Selling is Extremely Rare</p>
<p>New York telegram on the 7th reports the cotton market for the past week, saying that the cotton market last week, with the possibility of inflation and legislation being established, then the transaction had hopes of improving. Thus, in general, confidence in the value of goods increased. Although buying raw cotton is currently not eager, counterparts have been absorbing, and brokers are also paying attention. Southern selling is extremely rare, and those holding goods clearly have higher hopes. Regarding the relief plan, a measure to reduce the burden of farmland mortgages has been added. According to New York news, the passage of this plan does not have significant changes in its essence. However, public opinion is focusing on whether this plan will affect this year's cotton fields during its implementation. At the same time, it has some reducing effect on American cotton exports, because other products have begun to compete, and there is no good news about transactions in foreign markets.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source was 30-40 houses. City and rural stores, due to continuous rain, had few customers, resulting in a stable market. The package market has not opened due to commissions not yet being resolved. Thin rice is all going through retail routes. Therefore, rice prices from Su, Tong, and other gangs, as well as Qingjiao in the South Port, have no fluctuations. Duyan sharp and Yinyuan also show stability.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were 17-18 ships coming from various routes down the river. Although there were white japonica rice transactions, due to rainy weather, few bushels were sold. High-quality goods in the market were fixed. Medium and lower grades were slightly tighter. Thin japonica rice arrived less and sold flat, and the price trend was fixed. Early rice Yinyuan lacked arrival. Sheep, Du, and Port Spire were all fixed. White yuan added beyond the ruler.</p>

<p>Yesterday, passenger indica Minhua was also sluggish. The total market purchase was less than a thousand packages. However, a new Yong gang arrived in the market to try out a batch of Hunan Jing rice. Market sentiment was slightly hopeful, because the Yong gang had not been inquired about for a long time. The purchases yesterday were the first transaction this year. However, this time the Yong gang took advantage of the sluggish market price to slightly try it out. If it can be successfully sold after loading, there will be continued purchases. Whether it is successful is still difficult to predict at present. It is estimated that 430 bags of Jing were transacted, priced at $6.70. The Min gang purchased 300 bags of late Jiangxi machine rice, priced at $8.30. 535 bags of Hunan machine oil were priced at $8.40 to $8.23. 130 bags of brown red rice were priced at $7.55. Both the arrival and inventory of brown red in the market were few, and the market was stable. Machine late and machine oil were both lower by 5 points compared to the previous day.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in both the upper and lower districts, there were few advances and retreats in the near and far months. The market was gradually falling, because at the morning opening, there were no advances and retreats of foreign wheat, and it was temporarily difficult to divide fixed orders. Passenger gangs slightly bought forward and spot goods, and market sentiment rose, with the market standing firm. But after the market price rose, factories such as Fuxin took advantage of the trend to hedge, especially for near-month contracts, releasing 40-50 thousand bags. Although the number was not large, the sales appetite of the customer purchases was also small. Once the factory sold off, the price fell. There were even fewer advances and retreats in the afternoon. Far months stood firm, and near months continued to soften. The closing price for this month was down 0.25, next month was down 0.75, June was down 0.5, July was unchanged, August was down 0.75, and September was unchanged.</p>

<p>Yesterday's wheat market, after the opening in the morning and afternoon, was exceptionally quiet. Except for the few transactions in the far months with customers buying and brokers selling, the near months only had 2-3 cartloads of transactions. Because there were fixed orders for brokers to hedge in the near months, buyers did not dare to inquire. There were no fixed orders in the far months for many days, and some people were optimistic and slightly bought, but brokers took the opportunity to sell, so the market price did not fluctuate much. At the closing, April was down 0.1, July was up 0.1, and the others were unchanged.</p>

<p>The miscellaneous grain industry has implemented the conversion to selling foreign codes since the 6th. The commission must also be changed. Therefore, the Miscellaneous Grain Association yesterday convened seven groups to discuss the commission for export gangs, converting to foreign code calculations. As in the previous case, 2 fen in silver is now converted to 3 "dimes" in foreign code. As in the previous case, 3 fen in silver is now converted to 4.5 "dimes" in foreign code, and the rest are similar. There are still soy and rice industries, various fees and commissions for loading trucks and ships for inland customers, etc., that have also been resolved to use foreign codes. Because there are many items, it is not possible to record them in detail. It is heard that on the broker's side, there are printed public resolutions for commission additions and fees for file storage, etc.</p>

<p>Coarse Granulated White Up Corner and Half</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a tighter trend due to the benchmark gold price rising again and Dutch exchange shrinking slightly. The association's division board for 24 coarse granulated white ordinary goods initially called for $21.40 for buyers, and buyers were only willing to pay $21.25. Later, there was some trading at $21.30. Number 20 medium granulated white called for $20.05, number 18 for $20.04, and number 8-9 Dutch red called for $17.10, all lacking transactions. On the factory side, Renji opened the price for the local cotton white at $20.005. The Guangshan gang's number plate opened with over 200 bags of Huizhou white, priced at $20, a rise of 4 dimes compared to the previous day. The new cotton red opened with over 100 bags, priced at $16.05, and $15.90 for the second grade. Chao sugar opened with a batch of Huanggang Qing, priced at $12.56, and $12.42 for the second grade (including the broker's commission).</p>

<p>Recently, imports of Japanese silk to places like New York and Lyon have continued smoothly, and silk inventories are abundant. Furthermore, silk weaving factories are focusing on rayon for thin silks, and Japanese silk merchants are aggressively competing in sales. There is currently no possibility of turning around the sales of Chinese silk in Europe. Yesterday, the market was only open for half a day in the morning, and the silk market appeared increasingly weak. Only Sinfoo supplemented ten lots (13-15 taels per lot) of Kinshou brand white factory raw silk for immediate delivery, with a price of 555 taels. New Shih Chang supplemented ten lots of Flying Boat brand Chiliao white raw silk, with a price of 455 taels. Poxing supplemented five lots of Japanese Hua brand 26-28 taels per lot cotton spun raw silk, with a price of 420 taels.</p>

<p>Shexian green tea is traditionally divided into two types: foreign firm tea and local firm tea. Last year, over 20,000 chests of local firm green tea were produced. Due to its rich taste, sales were not very sluggish, and business results were better than those in Wuyuan, Tunxi, and other areas. This has attracted the attention of many tea merchants. It is reported that more than ten new tea firms have been established in that area, and tea merchants have also been releasing large amounts of funds recently.</p>

<p>The local foreign firm tea market has been exceptionally quiet recently because most of the current inventory consists of waxed eyebrow tea from Wuyuan, which is expensive and does not suit market demand. With the new tea season approaching, Chinese merchants have had to lower prices to sell their goods. Yesterday, Yongshengchang Tea Company sold over 300 chests of waxed eyebrow tea to Jinlong Foreign Firm at a price of 73-74 taels, a very low market price. In addition, local firms such as Xiehe and Yihe also made some small purchases. The tea market trend has become slightly more active than before.</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Sources report that Mutō has now changed his strategy, ordering Ding Qiang, also known as Li Jichun, Cheng Guorui, Fang Yongchang, Shao Benliang, and other rebel troops to break away from the puppet state and establish their own banner. The Japanese army will secretly assist them with weapons and ammunition and drive them all into the pass to let Chinese fight Chinese. In this way, Japan will not bear any responsibility to the international community. These villains are plotting to occupy the provinces of Chahar and Hebei and establish a puppet government. They have sent someone named Ma to Tianjin to secretly set up an agency in the Japanese concession, under the full control of the Japanese Nanggong. (9th dispatch)</p>

<p>Roosevelt Invites Representatives of Various Countries to Discuss the Overall Situation</p>
<p>Separate Talks Will Be Held, Not a Round Table Meeting Format</p>
<p>Luther Appointed German Representative; France and Italy Are in the Process of Selecting</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 8th: The question of who will represent Germany, France, and Italy at the Washington conference to discuss economic matters is currently attracting the attention of various governments. The British Prime Minister is scheduled to depart for the United States on April 15th and will hold talks with President Roosevelt first. President Roosevelt has made it clear that he does not want to hold a round table conference in Washington but prefers to talk with representatives of various countries individually. According to news from Berlin, Dr. Luther, the German ambassador to the United States, and another member of the embassy will represent Germany. Dr. Luther is familiar with Germany's economic difficulties and world affairs, so the German cabinet selected him as its representative, so that German Chancellor Hitler or Foreign Minister Neurath may not have to travel to the US capital in person. The Italian government has not yet made a decision on sending an envoy to the United States, but it is generally expected that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, who has not left Italy since 1923, will probably not make a personal appearance. As for France, Foreign Minister Pang Gu today had a long telephone conversation with former Prime Minister Herriot. If Herriot accepts the government's invitation to represent France at the US meeting, the government will give him full authority and will not send a financial or economic delegation with him.</p>

<p>Reuters, Washington, 8th: Secretary of State Hull told reporters today that the main goal of the United States in future economic discussions is to guide the world out of the predicament of economic nationalism. In recent years, various countries have revised their tariffs and engaged in competition, causing great harm. The United States is one of the creators of this situation and also one of the most severely affected. In the past few years, the United States has reduced its foreign trade by a huge amount of 600 million yuan. The goal of this discussion is to seek a general compromise on the principles of reducing tariffs and abolishing exchange restrictions. Due to time constraints, specific tariffs will be left to the countries themselves to determine. As for practical plans and detailed measures, they will be discussed at future world economic conferences. According to news today, Canada and Mexico have been invited by the United States to send personnel to the United States to participate in the discussions.</p>
<h3 id="e246">Japan Also Invited to Send Representative; Will Be Represented by Debuchi <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, September 9th: The United States is about to convene a preparatory meeting for the World Economic Conference. On the afternoon of the 7th, the Undersecretary of State verbally invited Ambassador Debuchi to the United States to participate on behalf of Japan. According to a telegram arriving at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the invitation included the following: "The President intends to personally discuss everything with the representatives of major countries regarding the preparation for the World Economic Conference and has issued invitations to various countries. This meeting will address the issue of disarmament, and it is hoped that your government will also send an important official as its representative." The Japanese government has decided to accept this offer and will instruct Ambassador Debuchi on the 10th to reply and participate in the meeting. The government representative must address the issues of war debts and disarmament, so it wants either Prime Minister Saitō or someone from the cabinet to go to the United States as its representative. However, it will be impossible to arrive in time for the preparatory meeting scheduled for the 22nd and 23rd. As a result, Ambassador Debuchi will be appointed, assisted by Finance Officer Tsushima. However, since the US President will meet with representatives of various countries separately, there is no need to arrive in the United States by the 22nd or 23rd. The possibility of sending another important official is being considered. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has instructed Ambassador Debuchi today to report in detail.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, September 9th: The International Economic Conference will be held before July 25th. From June 10th, preparatory talks will first be held in Washington by major countries. The Japanese government, with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Finance at its center, will establish a committee to discuss countermeasures. The general policy that will be adopted is as follows: (1) Although the war debt issue is not directly related to Japan, Japan will fully support the economic conference to cooperate with various countries in overcoming the world's economic depression. However, on the issue of disarmament, Japan will adhere to its established policy, that is, adhere to the contents of the Japanese proposal submitted to the General Disarmament Committee in Geneva. (2) Regarding international economic policy, Japan will advocate the following points and demonstrate its practical coordination: (a) The international adjustment of commodity prices and economic problems should be based on the restoration of the gold standard. (b) Restore the price of silver. (c) In order to adjust the movement of capital, restrictions on exchange must be eased. (d) To ensure the freedom of commerce and make it thorough, international coordination should be conducted on tariff policies.</p>

<p>(Harbin) The Soviet side prevented the western line of the Chinese Eastern Railway from directly connecting with the Trans-Baikal Railway at Manzhouli yesterday. It is heard that the Soviet side will take similar actions on the eastern line. The puppet Manchukuo side plans to take similar coercive action at Pogranichnaya, the point where the Ussuri and Eastern Railway lines connect, as it did at Manzhouli. Relations between Russia and "Manchukuo" are becoming increasingly strained due to the Soviet side's removal of freight cars. (Dentsu dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Changchun) Disputes over the Chinese Eastern Railway issue are intensifying. Due to the Soviet side's actions, train operations are being hindered. Morita, the director of the puppet railway, has urgently traveled to Harbin again. Prior to his departure, Morita consulted with key officials of the State Council at 9 AM yesterday, and the following policies were decided: They will use this as the basis to make serious demands on Guziriev, the deputy director of the Chinese Eastern Railway: (1) The usage fee for all freight cars of the Chinese Eastern Railway used by the Soviet Union in the past year must be paid in the amount of 4 million gold rubles. (2) The date of payment must be clearly stated. (3) "Manchukuo" respects the existing treaties and believes that the management rights of the Chinese Eastern Railway are equal to each other according to the Feng-Soviet Agreement.

<p>TASS, Inisk, England, 8th: The Soviet Union considers the British government's attitude towards the case of the British engineers of the Vickers Company being detained, as demonstrated by the recent passage of the authorization to the government to ban Russian goods, to be inappropriate. Today's government gazette "Izvestia" commented on it in an editorial. It said that after the British diplomatic authorities received the news that British engineers had been detained in the Soviet Union, without asking how the case was, they used all kinds of intimidation, proposing the theory that they could not have committed a crime. The Soviet government gave a careful reply to this kind of diplomatic intimidation. Because its purpose was not achieved, the British government increased its threat and made it a concrete proposal to threaten the Soviet Union with material losses. However, the Soviet industry is overthrowing the old Russia, not to create freedom on Soviet land for foreign capitalists, nor to introduce imperialist laws to its land. Therefore, the British government's threat in this case only shows the nature of its foreign policy. The British government, as one of the initiators of the future World Economic Conference, is a "restorer" of the world economy, and now it is creating a prominent example of damaging international relations. It is easy for foreigners to commit crimes in other countries, especially in the economic relations of two different social systems. If the British authorities want to threaten to sever business relations because of this kind of incident, it will be difficult to do business. In fact, there are thousands of foreign engineers in the Soviet Union, and only this kind of judicial interference occasionally occurs, which shows that the Soviet Union has no malice in it. The British government's threat of economic boycott in this kind of event, which is not a violation of international commercial treaties but only the application of law to foreign criminals in other countries, shows that Britain may have deeper motives. We will talk about this motive in the future. At present, what the Soviet Union wants to decide is how to apply its laws. The newspaper concluded that no matter how threatened, the Soviet court will not be affected. The only result of this kind of threat is to make the workers and peasants of the Soviet Union understand what the words of friendship and peace used in British diplomacy are worth. As for which of the British and Soviet Union will suffer greater losses due to this kind of threat, we will have to wait for future results.</p>

<p>German Ambassador to Moscow Assures Russia</p>
<p>Will Not Hinder Bilateral Business Relations</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 8th: German Ambassador Dirkson visited Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov today, stating that the German government has begun investigating the protest raised by the Soviet Union on April 3 regarding the illegal arrest and abuse of Russian nationals reported by the Soviet embassy. At the same time, Dirkson assured that the German government will ensure that Soviet business institutions can operate unhindered in accordance with the treaty. Regarding Dirkson's hope that Soviet business institutions can sever ties with the German Communist Party, and mentioning that a large number of German employees of the Delopro Company are Communists, Litvinov declared that Soviet business institutions are absolutely forbidden from having relations with the Communist Party or other political parties. They have received strict instructions not to interfere in Germany's internal affairs, so this kind of assumption has no factual basis. However, Soviet business institutions cannot be responsible for the individual political activities of their employees, especially since German institutions and companies are still allowed to employ Communists.</p>

<p>Havas, Berlin, 8th: German public opinion is paying close attention to the talks between Davis, the US Chief Representative to the Disarmament Conference, and President Hindenburg, Chancellor Hitler, and Foreign Minister Neurath. The Vossische Zeitung reported, "Regarding the World Economic Conference, what Germany hopes for is that several international financial issues can be resolved by the conference.

<p>Reuters, Berlin, 8th: Today, the German government issued a new law that all Jews are forbidden from serving in civil administration. Therefore, tens of thousands of officials left over from the previous government will be dismissed. Only Jews who were already serving in civil administration when the European War began on August 1, 1914, and those who served in the trenches during the European War, or whose fathers and sons fought for Germany, may retain their positions. This number is very small. Anyone who has one Jew among their four grandparents will be considered a Jewish official. All Jews who obtained civil administration positions after 1918 solely because of joining a political party and without the necessary special qualifications will also be dismissed, receiving only three months' salary and no benefits.</p>

The crowd wanted to hold a demonstration, but the government forbade it. At the end of the meeting, a motion was passed stating, "The current German administration is sufficient to reduce its national status. We hereby strongly condemn it. We express our approval to anyone who morally and materially resists Germany under Hitler's rule." When the crowd dispersed, they shouted "Long live peace" and "Down with Hitler" slogans.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 8th: British politician the Marquess of Reading, who has served as Viceroy of India and in key cabinet positions, has resigned as President of the Anglo-German Association and left the association because he is dissatisfied with the anti-Jewish policies currently adopted by the German government. The Marquess of Reading has been elected as President of the Anglo-German Association since 1929. Reuters, Breslau, 8th: Today, a tavern in Breslau started a fight because it sang an anti-Marxist war song, resulting in two deaths and two injuries. Subsequently, thousands of National Socialist stormtroopers searched houses door to door and arrested more than a hundred people, including several key members of the Communist Party. According to police officials, it has been determined that the Communist Party is trying to reorganize into a "terrorist group." During the search, a number of weapons were seized.</p>

<p>Reuters, New York, 8th: The New York Commercial Bulletin stated that President Roosevelt has begun to use the power of the government to implement public works programs to settle the unemployed. President Roosevelt has rejected any plan to print unsecured banknotes and has limited the direct expansion of currency and the indirect expansion caused by the issuance of public works bonds. Most of those hoarding large amounts of cash in the United States have not sent their hidden gold to banks. In order to deal with these people, President Roosevelt will issue stern orders, only allowing cash to be used for necessary domestic and foreign commercial purposes, and this use must be certified by a license issued by the Ministry of Finance. Since the banking holiday last month, more than 600 million yuan in cash and gold certificates have returned to the banks, but 600 million yuan in gold coins and gold certificates still remain in the hands of the public and have not returned to the banks. It is heard that those hoarding the most gold are listening to lawyers' advice not to return the gold to the banks despite the President's orders. No matter how much is hidden, they are not entering the banks, or else they will be severely punished. Currently, some people are trying to test the constitutionality of this order. Constitutional experts believe that this test is one of the most interesting events in history, regarding whether the government has the power to confiscate private property. Many hoarders have already moved their gold to Europe and Canada. Although the authorities know who they are, they have not yet decided how to deal with the situation.</p>
