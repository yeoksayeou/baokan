<p>在國難頻仍外侮荐臻之今日。而粤海九小島又以被佔聞矣。九小島介乎越南菲律賓間。當北緯十度東經一百十五度左右向獨爲我國漁民居留之所在國際間確認爲中國之領土。乃於本年四月間忽有法輪駛往樹立國旗。宣告佔領。其出於非法之攫奪。固不待調查而已明。雖其地面積不過三百方哩。旣已入我版圖之中。即不容有咫土尺地之喪失。蓋利害出入所關猶淺而領土主權之被侵。有玷於國體者實大。此國人所以必須堅强擁護。力爭到底。不能以其「僻陋在夷」而等閒置之也。</p>
<p>自法佔九島之消息傳出後我國猶在遲　審顧未定應付之際。而在日本。已引起嚴切之注意據日電所傳法國於西貢與廣州灣備有容納一萬噸級巡洋艦之船塢。此將因佔領九島建築飛機根據地。並配備潛水艦。以期取得南海之控制權。顧就吾人觀察所及。法人所以突然有此侵佔之行爲者。與其謂爲别具企圖毋寗認爲效法惡例。與其謂爲蓄意覬覦。毋寗認爲趁火打刦。蓋自九一八事變以來。彼法人早已覷破我國人怯懦之心理。不抵抗之事實。私衰歆羨於日人之全艦勝算不勞而獲遂亦以染鼎之手段。分侵略之餘慨。其意若曰。中國可以放棄藴藏豐富之東三省。寗獨不能割愛一蕞爾荒凉之島嶼。可以斷送三百餘萬方里之廣漠。寗獨不能拱讓一平英里之塊土。</p>

<p>法國佔領粤海九小島</p>
<p>果無帝國主義意味耶</p>
<p>（華盛頓）據若干日本報紙載稱、美國已進行談判、欲在厦門西南方之東山島、取獲新海軍根據地、頃代理國務卿費利潑斯宣稱、「此項消息荒謬已極、不値討論」</p>
<p>云云、（二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）關於外國所傳婆羅洲越南非律濱間九小島一事、在巴黎方面探得情形如下、法國政府於一九三○年四月十三日依照國際公法所規定定之條件、由砲艦「麥里休士」號、佔領九小島中最大之史拍拉德雷島、當時因有時令風、未能將附屬各小島同時佔領、直至今年四月七日至十二日始由通報艦「阿斯德羅拉勃」及「阿萊爾德」號、將其餘各島完全佔領、此等小島僅屬暗礁沙灘、幾無人烟、時被海水淹没、且其位置在海洋危險地帶、爲謀法國亞洲屬地及大洋洲屬地間之聯絡起見、有在此等島上設置航海標識之必要、華盛頓九國條約中、任何條欵均未禁止此等小島之佔領、且在巴黎方面以爲該小島中之史柏拉德雷、經法國佔領已三乍餘、業經中國政府提出抗議、且亦未未　　出保留云、（二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）著名記者聖蒲里斯、對於法國在越南南圻與菲列　羣　羣島之間、佔領小可以置二千四百餘萬人口於不顧寗獨能保護此棲流荒島之少數漁民。其意又若曰。彼日人已極盡侵略之能事寗能禁我臠刀之小試彼日人已飽嘗獨呑之美味。寗能阻我杯羮之偶分。然而日人終未肯遽爾寗息也。故一方則製造證據。謂九島最先實由日人所發見。將藉爲抗爭之根據。一方則播散空氣。謂英國坡港交通將橫被切斷。以挑起英人之嫉視。其亟圖爭奪之心。理固已躍然紙上。帝國主義者實無時不思展其狡圖。亦無地不欲恣其蠶食也。</p>
<p>返觀我國之所以應付此事件者則何如外交當局事前固曚于九島主權之誰屬。事後又未晰法人侵佔之眞相。對茲一回事猶在外部「縝密調查」</p>
<p>中。迄示知何日方能「妥籌對策」也。海部雖有派艦往勘之議。亦祇如空山人語。播響而已。日昨西南政會曾有决議。將搜集九島禁隸粤版圖之證據。爲提供國府依理抗爭之憑藉。此在中央與粤方屢傳意見參差之局面下。能有斯對外合作之傾嚮不可謂非差强人意之舉。然以五國版圖證據猶待臨時搜集。已屬可異。至搜集何時可以齊全。抗議何日可以提出胥在渺茫不可知之數。我國當局應付外交。往往如此迂緩頓挫。而彼日外務省。郤已積極準備。爭</p>
<p>人先著。會看此一事件。且爲法日折衝之核心。而主權所屬之我國。反將退處於拱默旁睨之地位矣。</p>
<p>廁列强深矉環伺之林。處羣敵視耽欲逐之下。人爲刀俎我爲魚肉竭全國之必力。踔厲奮發以赴猶虞其不濟顧乃人懷怠志事掉輕心。遂致處落人後着。瞻今前途。不寒而慄矣。</p>
<p>島約十處一事、在「日報」發表論文、以資辯護、題爲「絕無帝國主義意味之佔領事件、」謂「法國起意佔領各該島、係因舉辦航海設施、安置浮標、以便航行起見、則以該處滿佈珊瑚小島、航行極爲危險也、法國此舉、有關公共利益、絕無設立新海軍根據地之意、法國在中國海内已有屬地、無事他求、世人即欲顚倒黑白、實亦無所施其技、則以此舉絕無帝國主義意味故也」云云、（二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>地理方面、據多田文男所云、熱河地方尙無地理學者詳細調查、從前英國之柏西愛爾、德國之梅倫德爾夫、日本之小川琢治博士、最近法國之謝爾坦、以及探險蒙古·中央亞西亞·西藏之瑞典人史文海定等、卒不能得其全豹、因此地理學上以熱河稱爲黑暗地帶、然該地方之重要問題、自來各國探險家學者均認爲不可思議之地、惟吾人由自然地理學方面觀之、此地帶爲平坦的蒙古高原前低平的中國北部一以及滿洲大平原之中間山岳地帶、又在蒙古高原上、有數階的準平原與遼東半島低平的準平原、在此遷移地帶、究有如何表現、成如何對比、實爲研究的大問題、又由氣候方面言之、熱河地方係乾燥的沙漠地帶、與多雨的溫和熱地帶之遷移地帶、故照生物地理學方面研究、係屬頗有興趣的問題、至於人文地理學方面、在此地域内、原爲漢族蒙古族滿洲諸民族之交界地方、應調查其分布勢力之盛衰、住居於裏海以至戈壁沙漠間之乾燥地帶之遊牧民族、與圍繞亞西亞大陸東南季候風地帶之農業民族、逈然不同、此二民族之文化、調和於住居交界地方、但形成如何的文化景觀、頗有研究、故亦待吾人調查研究後方有判斷也、綜上而觀、滿蒙資源與日本之重要性、無待多言、目下我國（日本）由農本主義、一轉而爲工業之國、然日本之工業化、對於技術與資產、今日已不成問題、唯一的障碍即缺乏原料是已、蓋日本產的重要工業原料、除生絲外、均感不足、今欲求原料供給於安全地帶、全賴亞西亞地大陸、就中滿蒙之防方面言之、適當皇道宣楊之要衝、他如人口食糧問題·工業原料問·物業市塲問題等經濟問題、在在與日本存亡相關、時爲供給帝國資源不足的地域是也、故此次科學的調查團之派遣、足徵我國（日本）使命之重大耳、</p>

<p>軍事中心的臨川</p>
<p>臨川特信、臨川舊稱撫州、交通便利、土地肥沃、乃贛省一等縣之數一數二者、惟縣境毘連匪區、遂爲中路勦匪軍事之中心、如前方宜黃·樂安·崇仁·黃陂·南豐·南城·一帶勦匪軍隊之往還、彈餉之運輸、舍此莫由、匪區難民、亦大多麕集於此、城内人口日增、街市亦頗形熱閙、惟商店生意、反覺冷落、蓋一般人民之購買力、省立第八中學、其他公所及寛敝私宅、亦多爲駐軍所借居、環城防禦工事、時見增修、行人往來、盤查綦嚴、槍敝探匪黨之事、幾無虚日、勦匪空氣之緊張、較南昌爲嚴重、</p>
<p>據該縣夏縣長談、勦匪軍事、倐已五載、地方担負、早已使盡過頭之力、即以佚差一項言、除早前已派無數不計外、最近兩星期内、又已派去千名、縣府羅掘無法、只好縣賞招募、能得伕三十名者、委以分隊長職、月薪二十元、得百二十名者、升中隊長、月三十元、一般富有領袖慾、且</p>

<p>稍有軍事經騐者、因出而號召、勉以將事、禾草則近城三十里内、早爲軍用盡凈、欲　一株、其可貴有如　慧、然每當年隊開拔、索需之紙、仍如雪片飛來、不曰待用甚急、仰　遵辦、即云事關勦匪、毋得延悮、他如臨時征辦之各種捐稅、亦多係討得政府好、失却民衆心之事、率行遵辦、尤感棘手、所幸全縣保甲組織、日臻完善、保衛團訓練得法、堪盡維持地方治安之責、各村鎭電話網已完工、若遇匪警、無慮呼應不靈矣云云、</p>
<p>麕集此間之難民、全係來自匪區及近匪區、（兵匪交戰區）如金谿·崇仁·樂安·等八縣、據各該縣間鄕會調查、數共五千、贛省第七區行政督察專員周作孚、向蔣委員長請得賑洋五千元、在公共體育塲、點名發放、人各一元、並贈蔣小照一幀、計八日始　事、難民衣服、多絲織品、老媼尤多着大鑲大滾、古香古色之服裝、視之幾疑其非近代人、非道地十足之難民、惟細詢之、則無一而非抛財產、棄田園之中產上人、殊覺惻然、至中產下人、雖欲逃亡、亦無其力、不淪爲匪、即爲魚肉、其慘苦更無論矣、聞散賑後、難民先後返梓者、數已不鮮、</p>
<p>訪某友於總部、詢以匪情、承示宜黃防線某團長報告、原文論匪優劣點甚詳、大意略謂、匪之優點有三、（一）官長士兵、均有政治意識、故能嚴明軍紀、指揮如意、嘗以鏡窺其陣綫、見彼等雖在戰壕中、亦時有開會演說之模樣、可知軍事政治化之運動、雖在戰時、亦不放鬆、（二）注重宣傳、該匪軍近水樓台、日受宣傳麻醉、至死不悟、固無論矣、惟彼且將各種標語、或用紙印、隨風吹送、或書木片、順水漂出、以圖赤化良善軍民、影響不小、（三）應戰沉着、彼匪若取守勢、無論國軍如何攻撃、均不輕易還撃、以致難窺虚實、其劣點亦不僅一端、惟物質缺乏、恐將爲其致命傷、蓋自赤區封鎖政策實施以後、每鹽一兩、今已漲價至二元、米一升三元、生活極苦、衣服亦多破濫不堪云、嗣友人接云、總部所設匪軍投誠官兵感化院、所收人數、已多至五百餘、匪方物質缺乏、蓋亦足爲離散羣衆之一原因也、</p>
<p>據合作社調查人云、此間農村經濟狀况、已顯呈半自耕農爲中心之小農經濟、入出不敷、多以牛打滾式之借貸及典當、苟延殘喘、其需救濟、迫切可知、但吾人（該人自稱）前往宣傳組織合作社以期恢復農村繁榮時、一般農民、反起疑懼、常以農村多設一機關、即須爲一筆開消爲口實、緩言以謝、故提倡組織合作社之呼聲、高唱雖已多時、但實際正式成立者、僅七處而已、（七月二十日）</p>

<p>南城特信、臨川南去、漸入匪區、南城南豐、曾爲匪陷、今雖收復、駐有重兵、但離城五里以外之鄕間、即有匪軍之游撃隊、不時出没、故公路橋樑及沿路電杆、時被燒毁、汽車被刦、尤屬常事、軍事當局、因倡議建設橋樑碉樓、維護交通、不久即可見諸實行矣、</p>
<p>晨由臨川出發、午抵南城、沿途出坡、多植人高松樹、水田早稻、時已豐熟、黃雲萬頃、農人正忙收穫、車入縣之警戒線、無論軍民、均受盤查、下車所經街巷、因有軍事障礙物、多爲曲折幽徑、兩旁墻壁、旣書標語、且鑿槍眼、直無隙處、入城、又受檢查、且公務人須出護照、商民須出證章、若係鄕村來城趕市者、除胸貼良民證章外、尙須向保甲長逐日領換通行路單、其規則如次、</p>
<p>（一）本路單祗限一人用一次、（不限制使用次數、惟使用時間、只限一天、）期滿仍須繳還保長核銷、（二）本路單不准借給他人使用或遺失、違則呈報縣長、以通匪論、（三）本路單在本縣轄境及毘連鄰縣二十里以内、發生效力、（四）人民請求發給路單時、須向保長繳納銅元一枚、以爲紙張印刷費、但不得多收或少付、</p>
<p>觀此路單規則、可知近匪區人民、匪特行動不得自由、且偶爾不愼、即有通匪嫌疑、故一般鄕人、除不得不賣柴草以易油鹽雜貨外、餘均視入城爲畏途、例如猪肥欲賣、平時則驅猪入城、以博重價、此時則僅向村中貼條、上書「某人於某日、殺猪一頭、願以廉價、論斤出賣」等語、村人久欲肉食者、届時因往分羹、其他雜糧雜貨、亦多以此方式、勉成交易、又所領路單、雖僅規定繳銅元一枚、但實際已多收二枚竟至四枚者、至所謂之良民證章、係用方寸白布、上書姓名年齡及住址、并蓋一保甲戳記、每張繳費、四五百文不等、遺失則尤糾葛無已、</p>
<p>城内街路、大都狹小、甚且兩旁商店屋　、相距僅隔二三尺許、光線旣不充足、空氣尤難鮮　、街人則熙熙攘攘、絡繹不絕、忻其成分、則以難民士兵、占絕對多數、吉屋出賣、良田求售之招帖、街頭巷尾、時觸眼簾、</p>
<p>乘便趨訪縣府、承某科長出見、據談、前年匪曾陷城五日、强迫商會、籌欵備糧、且利用地痞流氓、向富家蒐索無數衣物、在天一山戲臺上、任意發散、臺下人倘不接受、則大聲叱曰、爾爲資本家乎、後見鐵鳥飛至、則作鳥獸散矣、半匪區（即兵匪交戰區）田地、已全荒蕪、餘則照常可耕、匪區耕地、聞初以人口及土匪面積爲分配標準、嗣以人少田多、鼓勵生產、又以收百斤抽二十之辦法、集中糧食、經濟恐慌、曾發五角一元及一元五角三次公債、人民十六歲以上三十五歲以下、槪有當紅軍赤衛隊之義務、民衆大都敢怒不敢言、望國軍進剿、以解倒懸云云、嗣請其介紹往南豐政府、彼遙指遠在二十里外之高山而言曰、車經此山附近、易有被匪搶刦之患、南豐情形、與此地大略相似、若無要務、可不必往矣云云、</p>
<p>此地錢糧、除所納正附稅銀兩合元、逐年增加外、且時有公政捐·伕差捐·禾草捐·保甲捐·飛機測量捐等項之徵收、公路縣道所破壞侵佔之田地、應納糧稅、請求豁免、未蒙允許、所受痛苦、尤不堪言、（七月二十五日）</p>

<h3 id="c211">論讀經 <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>最近一輩賢明之士，鑒於邪說橫流，於是想在學校中添設讀經一科，藉以挽末俗而正人心。這原是很對的。聖人之言，本如日月經天，江河行地，試看自漢以來，文人要想博得一官半職，誰能逃出經書的　子？漢設五經博士，宋以經義取士，其間也著實出過名臣大儒，想喝墨水的都知道的。故讀經一事，雖有人目爲開時代的倒車，而我終以爲這是無可非議的。</p>
<p>不過談起經；地量言，照段玉裁所定，共有二十一種之多，靑年學生，功課旣多，時間又少，斷難一一讀之；以質言，閻若　費了二三十年的考證功夫，始能斷定尙書是僞作。這可見「窮經」亦大是難事。</p>
<p>若說選讀，確是可行，但我以爲選材方面，亦大有可商。茲貢一得之愚如下：</p>
<p>（一）　反時代潮流者不能選「民可使由之，不可使知之，」與「民權主義」</p>
<p>不合。「男正位乎外，女正位乎内，」與「男女一律平等」之旨亦格不相入。</p>
<p>「危邦不入，亂邦不居，」則是勸人對國事拘消極態度。諸如此類，似均不宜選作敎材。</p>
<p>（二）涉及戀愛性慾者不能選「踰東家牆而樓其處子，樓則得娶，不樓則不得娶，」及齊人一妻一妾章俱爲孟子妙文、但俱不可選。張生跳粉粉牆，卽是中前者之毒；闊人畜姫妾、乃係著後者之魔。還有詩經，現在似乎大家都知道十五國風的大半，是民間的情歌了。實則此說「古已有之」。宋代黃朝英湘素記裏早見及此，不過至近今而其說大昌罷了。髟若選國風作敎材，試問與選「妹妹我愛你」調兒，有何兩樣，不是同一誨淫？易經裏的「男女構精，萬物化生」更不可選作敎材，假使學生要研究「構精」問題，老師將何以對付？况現代敎育，最重興趣，若老師把這句意　發得淋漓盡致，他便要變成張博十第二。反之，他若假作不知，或含糊其詞，則學生又要說「連你這點都不懂」了。至如左傅裏的什魔「衛宣公烝於夷妾」等事，則更不成話，越發不能把它選作敎材，以免貽害一輩世禄之家的子弟們。</p>
<p>以上所述，心所謂危，不敢不言。是否有當？敢以質諸一輩提倡讀經的先覺。</p>
<h3 id="c212">橋 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 破釜</p>
<p>橋下許多孩子們泳着，泳着，泳過去，又泳過來，有幾個站着，拿着格子土布毛巾，拭了一會兒身子，却又攢進水裏去啦丨有幾個追着厮打，靑蛙樣；潑着水，笑着，嚷着。</p>
<p>橋上幾個孩子站着瞧，跟着笑着，嚷着。一些大人們坐在石橋欄上，搖着蒲扇子，扯白話，驀地，噗通，丨一聲響，又是一個赤着身子的孩子，一個觔斗，翻進水裏去了，好久纔見他露出腦袋子來。</p>
<p>那兒一個看牛的，一支手兒牽着牛兒，另一支手兒拿着雙布鞋子：跑過來，嘴裏哼着小曲兒；瞧着，把牛兒牽到河邊的柳樹上栓了，自家兒拽扎起兩支褲脚管兒，鞋子放在身邊地上；坐在柳樹下，就「切闊，切闊」，地洗起脚來了。　　一個唱新聞的敲着長鼓跟蹋鑼，手兒裏拿阒着的那條棒兒，吻着石頭地，「得得得」地響着，踱過來，背後跟着一簇人，他跨上了橋頭，坐在橋欄兒上：「鼕鼕推，鼕鼕推，推推推推，鼕鼕推」，敲着，敲着。</p>
<p>「喂，唱新聞的丨唱「梁山伯跟祝英臺」，幾多錢」？一個問。</p>
<p>「六毛錢，唱慣了的，不討價」。</p>
<p>「唔，便是六毛錢，六毛錢公權，孩子不算，這兒十六個人，六毛錢便是一百四十四個銅子。六九五十四，一九得九，一百四十四個銅子。每個人拿出九個銅子」！另一個說。</p>
<p>長鼓跟蹋鑼又敲起來啦！那唱新聞的張着吃　糠似的喉嚨唱：「說新聞，話新聞，新聞出在······」</p>
<h3 id="c213">兒子 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 賢賢</p>
<p>「三十無子平平過，四十無子冷淸淸，五十無子無人敬，六十無子苦黃連」，兒子，大抵是甜的不錯，「有財無子非爲富，有子無財不算貧一，原來兒子就是航空公路獎券頭奬五十萬。</p>
<p>觀音菩薩會得送子，土地老爺，也會得送子，無怪乎「一產三孩」的新聞，是常有人印着畫張兒喊賣，本來只要「誠心則靈」，怎怕不「求男得男」，「有求必應」。無怪乎我國的人口，由四萬萬，一變而爲四萬萬七千萬，「有子無財」的窮漢，拖着一羣拖鼻涕大兒子，癩痢頭小兒，一個個都是富翁，失敬失敬。　　實在不爭氣，娶了五六房姨太太，十年八載，屁都不放一個，莫說肥頭胖耳的兒子了。年年天竺進香，求神拜佛，外修裏補，種子靈丹當飯吃，依然故我，眼看着偌大家私，脚兒一挺，都是人家的了，好不着急。然而有了兒子便怎麽？還不是雙空手見閻王麽？</p>
<p>「痴心父母古來多，孝順兒孫誰見了」</p>
<p>，自從亞當夏娃到現在，還没有打破「二十四孝」的新紀錄。因作奸犯科而「禍延顯考」的「一應俱全」，「苦塊昏迷」的，打着燈籠都没處找。「老太爺死了」。「讓我打完了十六圈去」。得囉，想開些兒罷。兒子，這也是觀音菩薩，土地老爺送來的兒子。</p>
<p>說了兒子一大篇壤話，大家怕不都要對兒子嚇得倒跥倒跥了麽？不用怕，生兒子下百打彩票。雖然頭奬五十萬，是否十拿九穩，不便出立保單，但是「獎在即」的時刻，舌頭尖上，齒縫裏，總是甜津津的，也就夠味兒的了。「養兒防老」，到現在，兀是顯撲不破。</p>

<p>矛盾的現實</p>
<p>車老爺阿大曾經怎樣地威風過，没有别的，是他一開口唱起五更十送哭七七，卽使唸的不少别字，够那末引起十幾個同志園住他，崇拜他。</p>
<p>空閒時給他主人在寫字間拖洗地板，他於是感慨了，想：這就因他主人字識得較多曾辦事在桌上，坐車子，我爲了少識字，做事敢降級到地板上，並去拉車子，朋友阿二，能讀讀「楊延輝坐宮院自思自······」不是嗎？已改坐在汽車裏軟墊子上了；自是敢不像我每月只賺十塊錢！</p>
<p>他的思想不可算錯，因爲没有寫字間做大班不識字的；但也有矛盾所在而已，例如上海整千萬失業者之中，儘多着大學生，留學生，能找到如阿大般薪金的事且難！假使眞正也去拉車子，倒又没有這身氣力。</p>
<p>當然，這不是提倡不必讀書；祇是讀了書後的出路，眞成了問題！我有兒子（没有兒子更好），一定從小就呌他半工半讀，這半工不論在馬路上拾拾垃圾，飽受風霜之苦，以免他日找不到飯吃，不做寫字，敢可做做車夫等；原因：我没有遺產！</p>

<p>這個大兵呌余守直，是在高小畢過業的人，一排人算他最機靈。盛世民也是個當兵未久的人，聽了這話·很是有理，於是由班長講情起，一個轉商一個，轉商一個，轉商到營長那裏去。這位營長就極不願本營有發生繡球風的人，他旣是要請病假出去，也就落得放他一條生路，批准了讓他出去。趙自强這兩天不能出去，正苦着没有辦法，寫信回去，不知道實况如何，也不好在信上怎樣的措詞。現在盛世民出去，倒可以借着他的口回去報告一個消息。於是給了盛世民一塊錢，吩咐了他一些話呌他看看自己的老太爺。盛世民覺得這連長太好，千恩萬謝的出營去了。他在營門口雇了一輛車子，一直拉到海甸趙家。當他到了趙家門首時，天上那密密層層的鵝毛雪片，只管湧將下來。有時在雪裏吹上一陣風，捲着那支陣打起胡旋，向人身上直撲。盛世民身上有病的人，那經得住這種嚴寒，下得車來，進了趙家大門，就蹲在地上哼了兩聲。桂枝正把院子裏地上的煤球，用筐子向屋子裏搬，昻了頭望着天道；天也是和窮人爲難，到了這個日子，還下這樣大的雪。他忽然聽到一陣哼聲，到嚇了一跳，立刻跑了出來，向門口來看看，這是什麽事情，他看到了盛世民蹲地上臉色灰白不由得向後倒退了兩步，手扶了墻向他看看着道：你是作什麽的。（一四三）</p>

<p>人們的智識技能，雖然全　　經；可是眼爲「智識之門，」耳爲「學問之府，」耳靈呌做「聰」，眼靈呌做「明」，多見多聞的人，便是聰明的人啊。現代敎育最大的流弊，便是用腦和用力，不肯調劑，科目太繁，書本太，所以靑年學子，往往　成短眼，耳鳴，神經衰弱的毛病，兒意心身尙未發育完全，在下素所主張的，是寓智識於作之中，注入式的敎育，十分反對；因此在下便有這篇「手的敎育」的貢　：</p>
<p>試看啞吧的讀書，不是靠手嗎？盲於目，還有救，只要手的本能不消失便了。今人只知道智能從耳目上灌輪進去，忽略了「手的敎育」這是一個大缺點呀！手是人們一件有用的傢伙，可以煆練身體，創造事物，代表意思，委實比耳目還要有用。怎樣呌做煆練身體？如駕馬，搖船，盪　　，打乓乒，打太極拳，以及各種體操，不但可以維持健康，而且可以增進健康。活潑潑地的小朋友們，你們要來拿手煆練身體啊！怎樣呌做創造事物？說起來話長，現在我们生活上應用的物件，都不是手做出來嗎？我們還要利用這雙手來創造種種新事物。譬如手可以算帳，拇批當五，食指當五，中指當七，無名指當八，小指當九，兩手都是是一樣。只要兩手指合了攏來，便可演算乘法。例如六乘七，把右手的食指，抵左手的中指，以上兩手指相加爲三，作十位，是三十；以下右手四指，乘左手三指，得十二；三十加十二，爲四十二，便是六乘七的積數了。餘可類推。手指又可計算陽歷月建的大小，法在拳上關節數起，凸的是大月，（三十一天）凹的是小月，（三十天）順序數去，一些兒不會錯誤。丨惟平年二月二十八日，閏年二十九日。丨手還可以在燈光下，映出維，羊，兎，犬，僧，道，種種的形狀來，兒童最喜玩的。又可以把各指結紐起來做成許多名稱。怎樣呌做代表意思？我們曉得童子軍裏有「旗語」，可以代表講話；手也有這種妙用。兒童當踼建子，打皮球的時候，往往把小小的手面和手心，翻來覆去，去代拈　，這不像開會時候，　手去代表意思嗎？交易所裏的買進賣出，以及價格幾何，都把手來表示，可知手確可以代表意思了。</p>

<p>那威嚴的太陽，發出萬道火也似的光芒來，把大地上一切的一切，都如熨斗熨過一般的制服了。</p>
<p>惟有下級昆蟲中的螞蟻，還在那炎熱的光芒中辛勤地尋求它所需要的東西。它的脚是燙了；它的頭是熱了；還有那兩根伶俐的觸角，東碰碰，西撞撞；也表示著十分忙亂的神情。</p>
<p>軀幹强大而傲然自大的螳螂，神氣十足的　著兩臂走向前來。</p>
<p>「好呀！我有這樣偉大的身軀，還怕誰呢？</p>
<p>誰敢來欺侮我，只要給我兩臂一壓，就　死啦！哼哼，誰都不及我，我眞快樂呀！現在疲倦得很，還是讓我睡一覺罷。」一隻螳螂，得意洋洋的自言自語在說著，於是它尋了一處凉快的地方，竟不知不覺的到夢鄕中去了。</p>
<p>它用尖鋭的牙齒，狠命的咬住了嘡螂的脚，想搬回家去。這樣一隻大的螳螂，怎會給那細微的螞蟻拖得動呢？</p>
<p>螞蟻快绵得跳起來，飛一般的回來報捷了。它家裏的兄弟姊妹們，得了這一個捷報，也喜出望外，便很像受過軍事敎育一般的，整整齊齊的排著隊伍，怱怱忙忙的去了。</p>
<p>一個螞蟻咬住了螳螂的脚，一個螞蟻咬住了螳螂的頭，一個螞蟻咬住了螳螂的肚子···。</p>
<p>這時的螳螂醒來了覺得它身子怎麽痛痛的，又是癢癢的，怪難過得很，便將兩臂亂揮，向那些螞蟻打去，雖打退了幾個，個但是合羣力的鞏固，誰都不能克服它的，螞蟻們竟不怕死命的衝上去，咬那螳螂。</p>
<p>最後那自大的螳螂，終於覺悟子嗎？</p>

<h3 id="c218">大學敎育 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 郁達夫</p>
<p>在目下的中國，有些人主張，大學敎育，可以不要。更有些人主張，大學敎育的門面是要裝的，否則就不能夠得到庚欵，但文法科可以不要，或者至多，也只須留一個兩個大學裝裝門面，其餘的可以不要。</p>
<p>主張大學敎育可以不要的那些人說：「中國那裏要什麽學問？舉國上下，有那一個人，那一件事能夠證明是尊重學問的？專門人才，從中外的各著名大學裏畢出來的優很學士，餓死者餓死，貓貓虎虎，得到了一官半職，勉强糊口，把術，全部抛棄者抛棄，中國究竟要什麽眞才實學呢？」</p>
<p>主張不要文法科而要留幾個大學裝門面的那些人說：「讀書的目的在做官。可是中國的做官，何必一定要文法科出身的人呢？看看我們罷！學土木工程的，學採礦的，學地質的，學應用化學的，何嘗不是一樣的在這裏做官？要文法科幹麽？回頭製造了許多只有恩想，不識時務的人出來，說長道短，圖謀不軌，倒反而是國家的利。要撑門面，得外欵，只敎有幾個理工科大學或科學研究所就夠了。」</p>
<p>這兩派所說的都很有道理，而且實際情形也的確是如此。試看看中國目下在發號施令的那些爲黨國服務者，何嘗都是受過大學敎育的人？不過在這裏，我還有一點小小的疑問。我以爲學以致用，原是不錯，但人格的鍜鍊，當然也是敎育的一個重要的職能。能够抱定主義，甘心餓死，不屑同流合汚，取媚於人的迂腐之輩，正足以證明是敎育的勝利。能培植出這些人才來的大學，只有嫌少，斷没有可以不要的道理。其次，就以「學以致用」一方面來說，難道眞的做官就是讀書的唯一目的了麽？以中國的全部人口來分配，則文法科畢業的人才，何嘗會太多？不必去說窮鄕僻壞，就是離都會稍遠一點的城鎭鄕市裏，究有幾個文法科畢業的頭腦明晰者，在那襄處理事務，指導羣衆？目不識丁的土豪劣紳，與稍能執事的訟棍痞徒的所以橫行，就因爲大學敎育的不普及不澈底之故呀！若說大學敎育，可以不要，那敎育行政機關，及其他的許多有名無實，只知聚歛的虐民機關，就先可以不要。大學敎育的目的，豈眞只在於做官與騙錢麽？</p>
<h3 id="c219">文學之「有用」與「無用」 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 另境</p>
<p>所謂「文學無用論」，根原大概還在葉聖陶先生的「戰時瑣記」裏的幾句話，葉先生說；</p>
<p>「你說作宣傳文字麽，士兵本身的行爲的宣傳力量比文字强千萬倍呢。你說製作什麽文藝品，表現抗鬥精神麽，中國却是一種書賣到一萬本就算銷數很了不得的國家。在這一點上，我以爲執筆的人應該没落。」</p>
<p>這等于傳東華先生在「此路不通」一文内（見讀書雜誌新年特號）勸人家不要再走學文學這一條路，這都是「感慨系之」的話，若有人遽因此而以爲葉傳兩先生是「文學無用論者」，其實是錯誤之至，葉先生正在努力創作，而傳先生因爲文學有用所以在忙着編「文學」。</p>
<p>所以這倒並不像豈凡先生所說的「一半是不得志的志士的牢騒，還有是誤解了學問的本質······」云云，重要的我們應該分淸：文學之本質的効用與文學對於現實生活之效用兩方面。說前者，誰能否認文學對社會之永久服務的效用呢？講到後者，則現實諸相擺在我們面前：中國百分之幾的讀書人裏面，大部份還在讀三角家一個模型鑄出來的手淫小說，稿費低到與稿紙價格相差無幾，大學畢業生專和師範生搶飯碗，考留學生文學除外，敎育部命令停招文科，社會人士把學文學的評爲「學無專長」，所以文學者的出路祇有一條，那就是朱買臣向他的休妻所誇耀的「肩不能挑，手不能提，（而今）顫巍巍兩邊兩朶紫金花！」</p>
<p>面前擺着這種種事實，腦膜上自然會發生文學無用的感覺，除非他是造了洋房的『得志的志士』。</p>
<p>雖然，這并無碍於文學本質的認識，文學之有用價値亦不會隨敎育部之禁招文科生而消滅的。</p>
<h3 id="c220">從「推」到「拿」 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 孫泱</p>
<p>聽說從前有種拳師，有特别的按摩術，呌做「推拿」。如果誰患了神經衰弱之類的病，瘦得像根竹竿，被他「推拿」一年半載之後，就會肥得像個彌陀。雖無從知道這話是眞是假，但已夠證明古人也注意到「推」和「拿」了。</p>
<p>這兩天看到「自由談」談到「推」，不覺有感。古人的「推」彷彿是爲了活動别人的血氣，現在的「推」似乎可以活動自己的血氣。活動血氣雖同，而被活動者則異；在這年頭兒，誰都蹙眉比開顏的時候多，「第三種人」自不易例外，難免有時血氣攻心，爲了活動血氣，不顧「糊塗中看不不淸寃家，」便大「推」特「推」起來，「推」的工作，當然加緊／。</p>
<p>推得汗流遍體，大聲喘息時，就要先「拿」了。其實先「拿」也不要緊，如豐生所說，「推」没錢買船票的人的手續，是先把他的物品「拿」過來。但據我想來，先「推」後「拿」的倒也有不少。即如輪船碼頭上常有一種馬車夫，在你和他講好到英租界某地時，他便把行李替你搬上車子，連貨帶人一齊「推」到法大馬路的小客棧裏。接着就有頭髮光光的小開之流，開了一張帳單來：房金，車費，碼頭錢，小帳，少說點也要「拿」你十來塊。馬車夫自然也分到一點；然而，歸根是替别人「拿」的多，自己「拿」的少，糊裏糊塗，又認不昨寃家了。</p>
<p>本來「推推」原無關係，不過事後想想，自已「推」得頭上冒烟時，别人却已從容不迫地要「拿」了。寃家認淸，難免慚愧吧！</p>

<p>— 小雪</p>
<p>讀最近出版的周作人短信，宛如置身於深山冰雪之中，大有「無思無爲，世緣都盡」之感。彷彿在讀魏晋的「雜帖，」也彷彿在欣賞東坡山谷的「短箋。」稱之爲「現代的古文，」我想再没有比這更適當的了。</p>
<p>在給俞平伯的第一信裏，周作文論現代的散文小品說：</p>
<p>我常常說，現今的散文小品，並非五四以後的新出產品，實在是「古已有之」，不過現今重新發達起來罷了。現今的小文與宋明諸人之作，在文上固然有點不同，但風致實是一致，或者又加上了一點西洋影響，使他有一種新氣息而已。</p>
<p>這樣樣的論斷，作爲如作者一派的「逃避現實」的散文小品的浮面現象的說明，我想是很有意思的，周作人的短信就是如此的產物。但眞的可以稱爲現代的散文小品，與現代社會生活脈搏相呼應的東西，是决不會這樣的。</p>
<p>拿生活來說罷。周作人的短信裏，所謂「片言隻語中，」寫了些怎樣的生活呢？從頭到尾。展開了的，無非是如次的塲而；</p>
<p>讀古書看花生病問病「蓮花白酒」「喫福茶」閒遊閒臥閒適約人閒談寫楹聯買書考古印古色古香的信封信箋刻印章說印泥說夢宴會延僧誦經搜集郵票刻木版書坐蕭蕭南窗下</p>
<p>作乾的生活，完全是「古隱逸之士」的生活，完全是隔絕了緊張的「現代」的生活；如果再删去信中的「不蘭地，」「電影，」「汽水，」「啤酒，」「咖哩飯，」「電話，」「普羅文學，」「吉訶德，」「禮拜六，」「星期，」「航空信」等十幾種新名辭，這些微的現代生活味，那麽開一句玩笑的話，眞不知是羅貫中的遺著，還是施耐庵的佚稿。</p>
<p>「世事愈惡，反而走往閒適一路」（與平伯書三十二，）像這樣生活着的人丨丨坐「苦雨齋，」「藥廬，」「苦茶庵」中，玩弄着「食蓮花者」一類的印章，「作稿賺一點小酒錢。」丨丨其不「身心落伍」（作者的話，）又怎麽能夠？「寫散文稍爲何養神之道」（與廢名書九，）作者的理解如斯，這也就無怪乎讀者不能透他個人的生活，看到一些社會生的影象了。</p>
<p>作者說（與平伯書考八）：</p>
<p>一個人的生活態度時時有變動，安能何持十三四年之久乎？不佞自審近來思想益銷沉耳，豈尙有五四時浮躁凌厲之氣乎？</p>
<p>從作爲五四時期的戰士時代，逐漸的把自己的生活轉到完全離開了「現實，」而稱自己最光榮的時期爲「浮躁凌厲，」這當然是個人與社會衝突的結果的必然傾向之一，没有什麽奇怪；可是，在這裏，也能以使得讀者們看到，歷史的齒輪，是如何的殘酷的在進展。現在的作者，已經不是十三四年前的作者了，然而，被歷史的齒輪毁棄了的，並不是作者一個····</p>
<p>讀完了「周作人書信」（北新版）短信的一部分、頗有所感，提筆作此「瑣記」；不知其他讀此書的人　又作如何</p>

<p>賽珍珠女士，字文襄，美國佛琴尼亞州人，生纔四個月，就被她的父母帶到中國來。她的父親賽兆祥博士是基督敎長老宗的牧師，曾傳敎於淸江鎭江等處，著有不少的宗敎書，並且譯過一部分的新約，晚年任南京金陵大學神學敎授，一九三一年夏，染了痢疾死在廬山，离年八十。她的母親也是傳道師，對於文學藝術和音樂很有素養，早就死了。</p>
<p>賽女士幼時同她的父母住在淸江縣城附近小山上一所幽靜的小屋裏，她的游伴除了自己的一個妹子以外，全是當地的中國孩子。她從她的母親受了初步的敎育。據賽女士對紐約泰晤士報記乾說繼她的母親不但把小學校裏一般的課程敎了她，還使她獲得了藝術和音樂的趣味，而尤其重要的是使她意識到文字本身的趣味」。</p>
<p>因爲她那做傳道師的母親有着許我中國朋友的緣故，賽女士常常出入中國人的家庭，她不但熟悉了中國人的風俗習慣，還體會了中國的勞苦大衆和家庭婦女的内心的苦痛。她又有一個年老的保姆，常在坐着縫補襪子或是做什麽的時候，把自己幼年時代以及飢荒和盜匪的故事講給她聽，給了她深刻的印象。她從小就這樣地在中國人中間度着生活，所以後來到上海什麽學校來諸書的時候，她就幾乎不覺得自己和中國人有什麽兩樣了。</p>
<p>十七歲時賽女士取道歐州回國，便在佛琴尼亞州的拉多爾夫墨肯大學讀書。畢業時文學的成續特别好，獲得了最優等的奬品，一張美麗沙發。這張沙發現在還陳設在她的客譞襄。　　她第二次到中國來，先後擔任金陵大學東南大學敎授，暇時常寫關於中國社會狀况的文章，投稿於美國大西洋月刋，國民，亞細亞等各大雜誌。久之，美國人就公認她是一個「中國通「了。（未完）</p>

<p>「倘若再要逼緊一步說，那末只有把那些存在洋棧裏的材料提單，到外國行家去押錢了。這一筆或許可以弄到一萬光景；此外剩下的，只有廠裏那六七部卡車還可以押得三五千，若是廠裏現存的材料，都算不得一個甚麽像樣的數目，那末我就不必談到那上面去了。之光，這不是我個人財力的一篇總賬嗎！你覺得我漏了甚麻没有？」</p>
<p>「我不覺得！」</p>
<p>之光所覺得的是甚麽呢？他覺得的就是他的計畫的失敗。閘北眞像的艱苦，他已經從目覩證明以前耳阻的並非浮夸，以他們二人的關係以及伯唐的眼光和財力而論，他以爲很可以勸他對閘北做一件心安理得的事情，但是剛才又從這篇總賬裏，證明伯唐的財力並不及自己以前所忖度的那樣豐裕，當然，物質上的缺限，一時是難尋覓興奮劑去使伯唐忽視的！而伯唐呢，這時的姿態敢變更了，他把兩條腿子縮起來踏在椅子上，兩手把着膝頭，抬起腦袋呆望着對面的墻壁，於是那條懸在他那副雪白削長的臉上的挺直的鼻梁，這時竟取得了水平的位置，儼然像是一條腦威三桅海艦的船頭。他已經墜入沈思的境界裏了，這境界就是他自己心頭上的矛看的角逐塲。他很相信之光在閘北的視察和報告是有價値的，他也相信自己的財力的限制是很顯然的，現在自己所要求的，就是對於接濟的一個能使衆人悅服，而又能安慰自己並且不呌自己日後棘手的辦法。這辦法當然是很費斟酌的，他心裏一輕一重地斟酌，他那條船頭式的挺直的鼻梁，就隨着他的腦袋一左一右地搖幌；然而之光却没有悟到這一層，所以他在感到計畫失敗認爲無法可施的時候，忽然長歎一聲，誰知這一來，登時也呌伯唐照樣迸出了一聲長歎。接着伯唐就問：</p>
<p>「之光，你的歎氣，是側重那一點？」</p>
<p>「側重嗎？」之光說，「爲何而發嗎······也許就是因爲你的財力竟遇到這樣的限制而發的！······那末，你又爲甚麽嘆氣呢？側重那一點呢？」</p>
<p>「我的嘆氣，就是怪自己早没有勇氣也到閘北去看一趟呀！所以我現在對於接濟的辦法，」</p>
<p>竟没有勇氣尋出一個合宜的······所以我很想明天早上也去看一趟；這並不是對於你的話想做一番調查的功夫；目的完全在乎激起我自己的勇氣！」</p>

<h3 id="c240">我們的前途？ <a href="#c240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>最近日本陸相荒木在某處演中謂：「約在一九三六年大和民族將面臨一最嚴重之形勢丨余將使吾國人本武士道的精神，作充分準備將來此種形勢的面臨。」又據美聯社二十七日華盛頓電：「美國内政部今日以欵六百萬美金交陸軍部，作爲改良國防計劃一部之費用，以建築巴拿馬運河一帶及夏威夷羣島之港防。」聞此欵僅爲國防全數的一部，整個數目有逾五千萬金元之說。此外英美日又無不同時極力建造軍艦以奪取海上的覇權，歐洲大陸諸國則亦藉口國防，擴張軍備。吾人若回憶一九一四年以前各國武力競爭的情形，則今日的世界，實已與緊接歐戰前的局面相似，所不同的，今後衝突的地域，將在遠東，而非東歐大陸。在這形勢嚴重的局面下，中國究應如何準備來應付此空前的危機，根據我們目前的現狀來推測牠的前途，則祗有令人要十二分的懷疑與危懼罷了！</p>
<p>今日凡是一個中國人，應要深切覺悟的，那就是中國的前途即我們每個人自己的前途。我們倘若有一點不甘自棄的勇氣，我們就要從速地計劃奮鬭的途徑與應付的策略。我們不要以爲「一九三六」年的時間離今尙遠，我們應知兩三年的日月瞬息即臨。按實的講起來，倘若第二次世界戰爭果於「一九三六」年爆發，則我們即能立刻從事準備，恐怕還來不及，更何况根本上尙未準備呢？我們推想到大戰爆發後所必不可免的悲慘屠殺的情形，將開歷史上殺人的空前新紀錄，我們如立時籌劃準備，則雖有不及之慮，但總比臨時引頸就戮要好得多。然則我們的前途，還是任人魚肉屠殺呢？還是要殺出一條血路來繼續生存呢？此則有待於我們的自决。依賴苟安，冀圖僥倖，都是等於做夢！</p>

<p>— 張矞</p>
<p>爲了農村經濟的破產，我忍心地抛棄了可愛的家鄕，到都市裏來爲人作牛馬·以取得些微的代價，聊充仰事俯蓄之資。可是家鄕的况味，是每每縈繞在心頭的。</p>
<p>「叔叔回來了！」姪兒們這一種的呼喚聲音，是我每次回家踏到塲角上時，必定聽得到的。同時我的母親戤在門閭上，現出慈祥的微笑，看着孫兒們槍着替我拿包裏。因爲我每次回家，多少總有一點糖菒或是玩具帶給他們吃或者玩的。就是我不買，而我的哥哥也要託我帶一點給他們的。他們互爭着替我拿包裏，一半是歡迎我的回家，但一半也是爲着想多得一些糖菒和玩具。</p>
<p>但是，這一次的回家，雖然没有變換别種的情景，可是姪兒們口中的叔叔聲音，聽去似乎有點剌耳，而母親的面龐上，微笑也有點不自然，而且眼潭裏還多了幾點晶瑩的淚珠。原來我的哥哥已在去年的冬天病故了！所以她見到我，便想着了哥哥的死，因而獨動老懷，有點點然悲傷了。</p>
<p>我每次回家，總有哥哥的信帶回來，或者他把母親所歡喜的東西和可口的食品命我帶給她亨用。可是，現在呢？雖然我也帶一點，但爲了受經濟的壓迫，畢竟没有像從前哥哥所呌我帶的那樣多了！</p>

<p>— 王銘心</p>
<p>大賭塲</p>
<p>夜裏三點鐘的時候·老吳，小王和我同往一家大賭塲去玩。一進大門，眼前就是一亮，五百枝白熱的電燈照遍了大花園。剛停下汽車就跑來了一位紳士式的招待員，一看見我們，他便退了下去，大約知道我們無須再用「知客」了。</p>
<p>把高帽子和絲巾交付侍者以後，他給了我們三塊赤金的表埀，上面是兩個英文花字母。我們最先進入的，是一間銀行化的屋子，鍍　的欄杆道具使人眼閃得難過。因爲現錢帶得不夠，我們就在那裏簽了支票。我一共換了四十枚一百元的籌碼。（一百元以下的賭欵是應當用現金的）</p>
<p>走過了四五間屋子，挖花，麻雀，撲克，牌九，骰子，搖灘，應有盡有。當然，麻雀，挖花，撲克，都太費功夫，所以我們只隨便的下了幾個牌九的注。看臺面上，每一條牌出入總在二萬籌碼以上，每注平均都達千元。</p>
<p>賭客最多的，是骰子和大輪盤的所在，其所下的注爲數也比較小一些，有時也看得見少許的現欵。</p>
<p>到這里來的人到底大方多了，賺了一兩萬也冷靜得很，絕不似「貧人暴富」的喜形於面，即使丢了十萬八萬，敢也處之泰然，並不咸少絲毫笑容，也絕不似其他賭塲裏那種「窮兇極惡」的樣子。這一個大賭塲佔地約數十畝，花園佔了大半，十樓十底的四層樓洋房倒有一半是空關着。到這賭塲裏來纔可以看出眞正之謂賭，爲其他賭塲所望塵莫及；若把回力球場和跑狗塲同這裏一比，那更是顯得渺小簡陋得可笑了。</p>
<p>賭客，以海上寓公和富紳子女爲多。那種闊綽的舉止，富琐麗的衣飾，，恐怕是一般人所想不到的。如果你去竊聽我們算賭賬，你一定會覺得我們說的也許是「紙馬克」的數目，其實，驚人的巨額出入，在這里是視爲很平常的。</p>
<p>因爲室内空氣不大好，我們就往外面散散步。外面羅列的車輛至少在五百以上，但因賭客散在各處，却也並不覺得人多。一位千金裝束的年輕女郎遞過來三支綿花頭的法國紙烟，打上火以後，小王隨手給了她兩張十元的鈔票。此外三客咖啡茶，洋點心，果子聖代和三把手巾的代價是半百袁頭。其實，這些都是聽顧客自由取用，不取分文的，所付的只是給那雙玉手的脂粉錢而已。</p>
<p>屋子裏充滿了巴黎的香水氣味，太濃郁了，這對於來不慣的人，簡直要發生頭痛，未來派的道具（是一八一時代没有的）使一般賭客好似置身於舞臺或銀幕上，侍者的殷懃更把我們捧得像「福特大王」一樣。賭了不少時候，我眞有些厭煩了，於是就硬拉了老吳和小王跑了出來。</p>
<p>回到換籌碼的所在，他們看了我的籌碼，說：「九千五百點現鈔吧！」眞的，他們現鈔正多着，不上萬的數額是不大用支票代付的。我早已有了倦意，根本下了幾次注，有輸有贏，我也不知道什麽時候換進了五枚一千元的小代幣，可是小王和老吳，這天運氣不好，每人却輸了好幾千塊錢。</p>
<p>領回帽子和絲巾，又付了二十元小賬，莫名其妙的走了出來。這時候，賭</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>客們已經走了三分之一，門口除了我的汽車以外，還有兩輛新的「林肯車」在開着車門等着。小王和老吳，一人跨上了一輛，我知道這是這個大賭塲專用送客的，名義上不取分文，恐怕他們每人又得破費一棹酒席的小賬了。</p>
<p>我的車走在半路，海關的鐘已在敲着八點了。我就呌車夫直接送我到公事房去，好在那裏並没有什麽緊要的事要待我去處理，而且那裏敢有舒適的臥具給我預備着呢</p>
<p>車夫很高與的告訴我　　　是一夜的月薪還多一此。我笑了一笑，他還說：「　房的人說，請你們主人以後常常來！　你轉達！」</p>

<p>— 楊墨耘</p>
<p>舞女是一個跳舞塲的靈魂。眞的，一個跳舞場若没有幾個可以對付過去的舞女，那還是早點兒關門大吉爲妙。</p>
<p>她們爲了要增加她們的肉咸，有時不惜犧牲色相的連襪子也不穿，一直赤裸到大腿灣爲止（她們的袴子短得只能遮着前後陰部　。喲，那大腿灣　，　不知有多少男人曾溺死在裏面了啊！可是，就使整個地球上的靑年男人全死個精光大吉，她們也許不會動一下心，凖能立刻轉過方向進攻那將死的老頭兒。她們只認識閃爍的大洋錢！除此以外，她們的眼睛上是罩着一層有色的玻璃片······</p>
<p>她們有的是已有了丈夫，有的是已有了「拖車」（即愛人的别名，也就是「姘頭」的意思）更有的是像妓女一般的失去自由了。於是，那些「寃大頭」們　管開香檳，多送舞票，在她們也不過當做一　橫財罷了。　　她們會經　　　　　　甜蜜的情話，佯羞或佯怒的誘惑性極强烈的媚眼，甚至犧牲一個Ｋiss，但是，她們離開了你，又去這樣對付别人了；再說一句掃興的話，從你那兒得來的「寃錢」全是交給他們的丈夫或「拖車」了；更使你聽了興「我豈『瘟生』乎」之感的，她們天亮回去，心裏早就没有了你，却是裸着雪白的肉體偎在丈夫或「拖車」的懷裏追求愛的戲謔，性的狂歡······</p>
<p>不過，這些可憐的舞女們，每晚從九點鐘陪舞客跳到半夜三四點鐘，她們的腿和脚究竟是肉做的，不是鐵打的，　　帶　　　　　　　的腿　　疼痛　的腿回去。那些以舞女爲玩物的少爺們爲什麽只知道用錢去買笑，而不知道撫摩她們的痛苦呢？</p>
<p>Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ</p>
<p>但是，一個跳舞塲如果單靠幾張舞票來維持生命，這個跳舞塲老板的老婆準不會少，要不然，只有一個老婆的話，就不夠蝕本。固然舞女是一個跳舞場的靈魂；就是一個舞客到跳舞場去跳舞，也得下一番考察的工夫，才跑到一個他認爲舞女最美麗的跳舞場去；然而老板的心裏雖希望他的舞女個個都像天仙美女似的，不過他却不願意單靠幾張舞票來賺錢的，因爲賣掉一百元的舞票，他只能到手五十元；而且還要給舞女吃喝，舞票更要拿錢去印。他所希冀的是酒賣得多，茶，咖啡，可可，汽水，色白大菜等等也不厭多售；譬如一瓶白蘭地本錢十元，一杯一杯的賣出去，至少能賣到四十元左右；咖啡，茶，可可，汽水，每杯或每瓶的價錢是五角，你瞧，五角錢喝一杯茶或一瓶汽水，惟我獨尊的皇帝所喝的也不過如此罷？（如果你請舞女喝一杯Ｃocktail老實說，不是一杯酒，而是一杯冷茶丨五分之四是茶，只有五分之一是酒丨價錢還得貴兩角；這兩角錢照便由舞女拿，也許這是給她的奬勵金。）</p>
<p>所Ｂar（酒和汽水等屬於Ｂar）和Ｋitchen（茶，咖啡，色白大菜等屬於Ｋtchen）是一個跳舞場的兩棵搖錢樹。　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ</p>
<p>一個跳舞場除了每月的房金是一筆</p>
<p>最大的支付，音樂師的薪金也是很可觀的。一班美國音樂師的薪金每月至少在三千元以上；一班菲律濱音樂師也得二千元左右；就是最便宜的俄國音樂師，一班没有一千元也不行的。每半月一付，到期没錢，他們會武力對付。如果時常請他們喝香檳酒，或多給他們一瓶啤酒喝，他們能呌舞客多化幾個錢丨奏樂和休息的時間都縮短，而奏樂的次數却增加，舞票的銷路便佳。</p>
<p>至於歐僕，他們的心很辣。「紅眼睛，綠眉毛，」一個不留神，在你爲酒色所迷的時候，「錭頭」就給他們敲去了。</p>
<p>其他如香烟，糖果等等的價錢都要比外邊的貴一兩倍，這已是人人皆知，也毋庸我嘵舌了。至於一元只値十角（小洋），那更是公開的秘密，可是有錢的才上跳舞場，决不至於斤斤較量一兩角錢的；這算是便宜了會計先生。</p>
<p>Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ</p>
<p>總之，跳舞場是一部封面裝飾得很美麗的書，但如果把牠的目錄翻開來一看，那牠全部的内容所包含的却只是些：苦酒，骷髏，行尸，走肉，魔窟·哀樂，魔舞，靑春的葬送···。安樂窩？一個黑店。</p>
<p>白刀子進，紅刀子出，恐嚇，欺騙，弱肉强食，生死的交叉點，貧與富的對立，肉的出賣，腿的勞働者，樂聲的傾流，烟酒的剌激，只愛美人不愛江山······這些，這些，交織成一個跳舞場。</p>

<p>— 梅味女士</p>
<p>佛經說：「不生則不滅」，那末，我的血肉，是爲掙扎這悽慘的「生」而浪費！當我瞧見枯槁驚人的面孔時，我的心不自禁的哀呼了！從飄飄的雪花，直到炎炎的烈日，這幾個月失業的當中，如被踢入無底的幽洞裏，如被擲在生死不得的陷阱中。心緒徬徨的我，活像一隻喪家之犬！上不得天，下不得地，迷了東西南北的喪家之犬！</p>
<p>一個無家可歸，隻身流浪者的我，一量失業時狼狽的情况，這在得意的人們怕是再也夢想不到的吧！尤其是炎凉的世態中，無財無勢像我這樣伶仃的人，親戚友朋，偶然見了已夠他們的討厭，更不用說是存問了。記得魯迅說：「從小康之家墮入困頓者，這途中過來的人，是看透了人間的眞面目。」這是多麽切中世態人情的話！眞的，我是一個嘗遍了人生途上的白眼的人呀！</p>
<p>那實際問題，「生活」，依然很嚴重的壓迫着我，可是，這個失路者，除了捧着創傷沉痛的心，鎭日失望的震撃着腦筋，此外更有什麽辦法呢！每當午夜醒來時，這失業的恐怖使我驚問着自己：「假使這樣的生活再繼續下去···」唉！這可問住了我！這半年中，躱在寛不到五尺的一角小樓中的光陰，眞如夢般的模糊，自己也不知道是怎樣挨過去的。有時不自覺的在馬路上踽踽的徘徊，在這紅綠間隔的都市中，眼看着那些肥頭豐腦，意興飛舞的人們，一個孤零失業者的心是如何的悽凉與惶惑？呀！誰料生命的海裏，竟是那麽的不平？我仰望着天，俯視着大地，我的心緒茫然！</p>
<p>這時想到了漂泊異地的雪萊，和哀憤塡胸的屈原，徘徊泊羅，終沈蒼波時的心懷，想到了他們還能寫出光熖照人的哀歌！但是我呢？······這零亂的思緒，衝泛在心頭；兩條無力的腿，伴着一條瘦削的影子，回到宿舍門口時，聽得房東母女一陣談笑的聲音，驀然橫在天涯淪落者的心頭！便像一塊大石頭，霎時沉重起來！</p>
<p>在十年前，我就已受着飢寒的驅使，離開了故鄕，開始踏上了生活之路。我雖没有一技之長，但十年來從没有受過任何助力，都是自己找尋麵包，在猛烈的生存競爭的道上掙扎。過去我曾幹過中小學的敎職員，家庭敎師，以及其他類似的工作，現在我我切的想邮賣我的勞力。如本報的讀者，有用得着我的地方，事務不論鉅細，雖女傭亦願充任。我的要求敢不大，我雖活上了三十二年，但我還没有家庭及其他要我負擔的地方，祇要能維持自己最底限度的生活就是。通訊處本刋轉。</p>

<p>打樣的工程師以外。各層樓和每一個房間都有很精巧，很秘密的　　以便有人商議重要的事　　　　　　　　　　　牌室，吸烟　，以及牌九，撲克，考而夫，棋具，音樂······各部分，都有極貴重的陳更珍品，各種不同的美化裝飾。電燈發出温柔和媚的光輝，映着一張張喜怒哀樂肥廋黃白的大人先生們的面龐。侍者們小心翼翼的提足精神，聽受著任何人的指揮使喚。厚軟的地毯，沉重的受著皮鞋和手杖的踐踏與搗擊。繡織得極精緻的絲質椅墊上，不時的承接到肥大的尊臀和雪茄力克的煙灰。當綢花的𪴐布上被咖啡茶或有色的冰飲的水漬濺汚了時，侍者便很習慣地立時換上另一幅淸潔的檯布。冷氣管和水汀代替了不調節的電風扇或電爐，在冬夏可以任意支配不合用的過冷過熱的天時。有些像玉質又有些像不透明的水晶的牌面鑲着翠綠或粉紅的堅靭的牌背，在海楳檯上劈拍地磨擦數小時以後，侍者便至少有二三百元的進益，不用說四員戰將總有幾萬元的勝負了。過足了烟癮的有嗜好者，閒散地手執一捲捲每張五十元以上的鈔票或俱樂部特備的籌碼，不時的立在牌九局的人後觀風，下注······</p>
<p>是的，一切的一切都顯得有閒與著侈。</p>
<p>然而，全國經濟的，政治的，以及其他各種重要問題的商酌，是很多在這裏的牌餘酒後解决的！光顧到這裏的，至少是能夠操縱社會一部份勢力的達官顯宦或巨商，總之，是有身價的人！這裏的談笑舉止，能維繋整個社會的安危；他們走到這裏來，也並不是希冀享受什麽自身的歡娱，而在坐坐玩玩吃吃喝喝以外，却有許多關係於千萬人生命的問題，得在此來接談商洽！</p>
<p>濃密的樹蔭中，偃伏着這所一九三二年式的六層樓洋房，在没有進去過的人，當然不知道牠裏面的富麗與偉大。在四季有各式的窗幕的高大玻窗中，想透視到裏面的天花板，已確是一件很困難的事，更有誰能想像到這裏面的一切呢？而裏面噪雜的歡樂的牌聲，音樂聲，傾談聲，當然也透不到外面來。在那含有戒嚴性質的馬路上，人們便是　　經過時，也祇見到一排排的新式汽車的展覽和這一所神秘的建築物罷了</p>

<p>大戲院</p>
<p>ＸＸＸ路，這麽悠長的ＸＸＸ路喲！七月的太陽怪猛烈的，ＸＸＸ路是酥軟了。這些綠油的樹葉子，遮蔽了人行道上的太陽；没有姑娘們的徜徉，没有哈叭狗的奔馳，怪凄淸的。然面，這裏又多閙啦！</p>
<p>是在ＸＸ廳的對面，一所偉大的立體的建築下，接連的，一羣一羣的「雪鐵籠」，「道其」，「林肯」，「······」，都在咆哮着。</p>
<p>啊！Ｘ市第一個大戲院。</p>
<p>今朝喲！我要將賣血所得來的代價，踏進這大衆的血汗所凝成的結晶，享受三百萬元的設備。</p>
<p>在大理石的組構下，踏着雲毋石的地面，多光滑！我懷了這顆驚奇的心，踏着膽小的步伐，一滑一滑的，滑到那噴水管處，旁邊敷設了許多許多的花草，噴邮來的水：絳紅的，幽綠的，蔚藍的，碧靑的，······在交錯着。</p>
<p>時候還早啦，裏面的門也没有開，然而人已擠滿了。男的，女的；有的坐在彈力的沙發上，有的彳亍在光滑的雲毋石上：在期待着，瞻仰着黃色的圖案屋子。</p>

<p>全院納入了黑暗，所能認得淸的，只是銀幕上的約翰鮑里摩亞，達娜温媽······。</p>

<h3 id="c250">超現實主義的「中國電影的佈景問題」 <a href="#c250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— 許幸之</p>
<p>讀了靡蕪君的「中國電影的佈景問題」之後，引起了我許多的感想。靡蕪君所提出的：「第一是佈景的非現實」，「第二是不能把劇情統一起來」，這是目前中國電影佈景最大的缺陷。</p>
<p>可是，爲什麽會有這的缺陷呢？據我從攝影塲的經騐看來：（一）是因爲佈景師缺乏現實生活的經騐，（二）是導演和佈景師之間缺乏連絡的原故。</p>
<p>在攝影塲裏，導演有時顧慮到某一塲佈景的美麗和成本太貴，似乎拍攝了很少的鏡頭未免可惜，於是添加一些無意義的鏡頭和劇情。反之，因爲佈景的不美麗，導演以爲足以影響到畫面醜陋，於是任意减削了必要的表演和鏡頭。這樣，因爲佈景師佈景的不同，往往變更了導演固有的計劃。</p>
<p>他方面佈景師因爲缺乏着現實生活的經騐，和建築裝飾的智識，除了從書坊中購買一些參考書，把外國的室内裝飾及陳設，整個地搬入中國的電影之外，也從不曾顧及到中國的現實生活的構成。結果，便如靡蕪君所謂在「一個富豪的家中」裝飾着「窮奢極麗的裝置」，同時在「薪水階級的家中」，也是這樣新奇的一套」。</p>
<p>所以，電影中佈景師的佈景，不但足以影響整個的劇情，有時簡直足以左右導演的思考，和攝影師的計劃。往往導演爲了佈景的不同，而變更了固定的導演計劃。更因爲佈景的富麗簡陋，而打破了統一的劇的情緒。這樣，因爲佈景（部分的）的超現實化，影響到整個劇情（全體的）的超現實化了。</p>
<p>在攝影塲裏，中國的導演和佈景怎樣情形呢：在第一天晚上導演招呼佈景師說：「明天我要一爿好看的咖啡店」，可是，佈景師因爲時間上的關係，更因爲不明瞭劇情的原故，便隨便到書本上選擇一個圖樣，或是自撰一個圖樣交給了木匠。第二天導演看見了佈景的好壞再作計議，這樣，導演也超現實化起來，於是整個的電影的機構都統超現實化了。</p>
<p>這裏，爲要避免這些缺慽，我們要求着電影佈景的裝置，最好由導演自己來設計。如果導演家自己不善於畫圖和設計，至少須要給佈景師設計一個大體的輪廓或模型。同時佈景師也須要知道劇中的劇情，人物，表演和一切的動作；在攝影時，導演和攝影師須要不斷地連絡，方才能昨到統一的成果。至少我們還要求着每個導演須要具有圖畫，建築，及裝飾美術等的基本智識。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c251">評「陌路幽情」ＷestwardＰassage <a href="#c251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>丨大華映丨</p>
<p>看過這一影片之後，我想有不少人會給這劇情而引起傷感的情懷吧。特别是中間階層的智識份子，敢許更會承認這影片在文學上的成功。事實上，這是小說改編的。關於原著者我個人知道得很少，然而就這一影片的故事看來，未始不是自然主義的作品。同時原著者所以要以著作家爲描寫的對象，也許是這種題材更能獲得自身深切的體念。著作家的感情豐富，遇事不能理智而易於感情用事，這該是劣根性最普遍的現象。加之又是窮窘的時候，生活的鞭子鞭撻着他，於是煩惱的心情常引起暴戻的行動。何况物質的享受不能給妻子有低度的滿足，所以貧賤夫妻終至决裂，當亦在情理之中。然而讓妻子帶着女兒去改嫁别人，到底也是傷心的隱痛。在這種情形之下，他們倆又異地相逢，女兒跟着呌爸爸，妻子想起了從前的恩愛，情何以堪雖然他們終於破鏡重圓，可是此種辛酸滋味，到底使人感着深重的傷情，尤其是Ｓtory不脫離經濟基礎，更是比較正確的理解。</p>
<p>如上述，這一影片的情感的確是十分成功的。特别是導演描寫得十分細膩，一點一滴，都是情感的流露。尤其是當他們和好以後到了曾經有過極度恩愛的旅店中，又因細故爭吵起來，妻再决心他去，而復因見了女兒的玩具乃罷；這種簡潔的手法，眞是不可多得。至於因故誤損了丈夫的原稿，而使他立時生氣，這是原作者最深刻的筆調，同時也是導演得意的手法。不過整個的說來，不免沉澀了一點，然而假如爲了要何持原作的情調，却也是没有辦法的。而且對於稍有文學興味的觀衆，也許仍很相宜吧。</p>
<p>關於這位導演ＲobertＭilton先生，我們所知道的也並不多，然而僅在這一作品中，我們也就不能忽視他藝術的修養之深了。他不僅是對於編輯和剪接都有適當的運用，即對於音樂的配置也很精細，例如最後的披亞娜的演奏。</p>
<p>使安哈婷ＡnnＨarding做一個賢妻的角色，大概是很相宜於她的性格，正如她以前所出演的同樣個性的角色，都不失敗。奥文（ＬautonceＯliver）所飾的著作家，似嫌不夠。茨蘇薜茨（ＺasuＰitts）在這裏也很好。</p>
<p>然而這一影片有一個最大的缺點，便是收音的失敗。這一損失多少是遺憾的了。</p>
<h3 id="c252">晨報每日電影的「影評人事」 <a href="#c252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>素來對於申報電影專刋肯降尊紓貴來進「忠告」或「貢獻」的晨報每日電影，昨天登了一段「影評人事」的消息，裏面寫的是「電影批評家凌鶴君聞將有主編申報影刋之說，昨夜十時，特在蒲石路招集影評家多人開會討論組織一影評人團體。内容結果均未詳，」未知此消息從何而來？向來每日電影對於本報的「人事」，要聽得很詳細；但是有時亦弄出笑話來，譬如因爲攻撃甲太厲害了，故意加一兩句揄揚揄揚乙，其實甲乙都是一個人之類，本刋編者對於這些地方，從來没有道破，儘管讓牠去猜測去，現在這段「人事」，大概亦係測量得不正確的緣故吧。至於有無别的惡意，如凌鶴君自己所懷疑的，那鄙人亦管不了多少。外人造作新聞，中傷感情，當然亦不發生效力。至於本刋現任編輯所署的「不敏」二字，亦係虚空的筆名。將來倘使凌鶴君主編申報影刋，我必定將這「不敏」二字的老招牌，奉送給他。到那時候請「每日電影」的諸位先生們，再打聽打聽淸楚到底這個「不敏」還是那個「不敏」呢，還是這個「不敏」已經不是那個「不敏」了呢。（不敏）</p>
<h3 id="c253">評「大復仇」ＴheＦightingＭarshal <a href="#c253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— 頑石</p>
<p>又是一部武俠影片</p>
<p>不過我總覺得很奇怪，美國在中國國產武俠影片差不多已經禁絕的情形之下，仍將這類片子長驅直入的大量供給。那末這種迎合低級興趣的作品，在中國仍然能夠相當賣座，也是不成問題的，否則爲什麽會源源不絕而來。也許來路貨到底比土產好得多，同時更不危害</p>
<p>中國社會；其所以不被禁的理白也就出此。</p>
<p>但是就這部影片而言，它的内容也並不見得合乎上述的條件。很顯明的，這和江湖奇俠傳等著作，就是司一模型的作品。一個英雄爲了報殺父之仇，破牢獄，冒充官吏，假公濟私，單槍匹馬，大打出手。同時英雄必定多情，於是乎美人在抱。最後是父仇旣報，英雄也服法而好事諧焉。這有敎育意義嗎？這是一個典型的人物嗎？然而以「復仇」和「服法」聯繋在一道，却是十分合乎現代規律的，所以殺官吏而又冒充官吏，並不爲乘政者縐眉頭。</p>
<p>像這種影片，我想是不必怎樣去估計他在藝術上之價値的吧。姑勿論製片公司的機械有何等精巧，姑勿論諸作者的技術是何等高明，像這樣無聊的故事去給他穿上華美的外衣，還不是耗費了財物和精力嗎，何况在草人身上就不能裝成一個有生命的東西，即算像一個人，始終不過是嚇嚇鳥獸而已。</p>
<p>再明白一點說，這一影片的演出技巧，在任何方面說，却是雛型的，陳舊的，庸俗的，也是淺薄的。騎馬，跑，逃，追，相互的映了又映，成績是嬴得了庸俗的喝采，空虚的緊張。假如說這便合乎電影理論上的「時間與空間」論，那末電影將是何等可笑的東西啊！退一睄說，照這樣努力下去，電影藝術將要開着倒車而復古了。</p>
<p>有不少人說，電影不是課本而是純粹的娱樂品，這句話是否能夠成立，我不欲在此說明，不過像這樣的影片到底不能使我們得着充分的娱樂吧？未知看過本片的讀者諸君有否同感？</p>
<h3 id="c254">最近美國之戲院業 <a href="#c254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— 何卒</p>
<p>近年來，能切實的表現出美國社會傾向的事業，要算是都市娱樂設備的超常態發育了。</p>
<p>处十九世紀末葉，合衆國整個的經濟組織偏向於機械生產以來，人民的勞働時間，日趨短縮，一般人皆感着空閒而致生活單調；那末，把來領受最善方法的享樂是最適宜的了，有人曾這樣提倡過，並且希望，這享樂又必須是普及到勞苦大衆的。果然，在最近的二十年裏，此種理想己漸漸的轉成爲事實了。電影企業的廣大化即是一個最好的例子　　據美國公家的調查，一九三二年一月時，全美（屬地尙不計在内）境内公開營業的電影戲院，共有二萬二千七百三十一所，計可容納觀衆千一百三十萬人。如以一日三塲推算，則每日當有三千三百九十萬人光臨戲院。</p>
<p>又據一九三一年份之統計，每周觀衆亦超出一萬萬人，而售得票價之總數，爲一萬萬五千萬金圓。</p>
<p>至於電影工業投資的確數，雖無精確的統計，但終須在二十萬萬元左右。　　美國電影事業之驚人發展，很能達出其近代化的彩色。</p>
<p>再說，這年頭兒的美國，幾乎甚麽皆流於不景氣。但，紐約的戲院，却還是那樣的容易吸人，由這一點着想，則可以想見的了。</p>

<p>（十四）新巴比倫城（德國）Ncudabelsberg</p>
<p>丨烏發公司攝影塲在柏林左近丨</p>
<p>在歐洲所有的影塲中，要算烏發城爲最完備和最新式了，它是坐落在柏林左近的新巴比倫城。它有十四座分離的音臺和四十二座供給製造影片的建築物。但是在一九一二年時，那裏祇有一間細小的玻璃屋，拿來做攝影塲，不過用以避避風雨罷了。到一九二九年四月，才重新去建設這新的烏發城，塲内與塲外的流通空氣，係採用科學方法。那怕外外而雷聲轟轟，也不致傳到塲裏工作人員的耳鼓裏去。</p>
<p>烏發城的工塲裏，每年要用十萬方碼疊木和竹布，四萬方碼舖板，六十萬英尺板條和花線，三百噸灰泥，六千方尺玻璃，和一百萬啟羅瓦特的電流。圍繞在影塲邊上的，是一排一排的摩登化裝室，浴間，休息室。還有供給五百影塲夥友應用的辦事室和宿舍等。他們每年出品的影片，達一千六百萬英尺。</p>
<p>關於機械方面，是無可指責了，就是關於人類的工作方面也恐怕没有一個影塲，敵得上他他那種合作精神了。在影塲裏面的一所飯館裏，你會看見電氣工人和臨時女演員同坐進餐，木匠會同了伙夫一塊兒飲咖啡，還有明星常和導演在那裏討論影片中的難點。他們裏面雇用着八百工人，大家都是非常和衷共濟的，這確是烏發城的特别長處了。（完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Receiving Linyu County Yesterday Afternoon <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Director Yin Led Police Force to Haiyang to Take Office</p>
<p>Yin Tong and Others Returned to Beiping to Report on the Receiving Process</p>
<p>The Negotiations for Receiving the Northern Route Have Been Successfully Concluded; The Issue of Shi Yousan's Troops Can Also Be Resolved</p>
<p>Miyun and Huairou Have Been Received</p>
<p>Jixian and Zunhua Are Still Pending</p>
<p>Li Jichun Assumed the Position of Chairman of the Committee</p>
<p>(Tangshan) The receiving negotiations in Linyu encountered the issue that the Linyu Administration Office and other administrative organs established by the puppet state in Shanhaiguan were not prepared to be abolished. Before the Yuguan Incident, the Linyu County Government had moved to Haiyang Town, which the other side used as a reason. Our side, considering the extreme complexity of Yuguan, temporarily refrained from insisting on establishing the county government in Yuguan, pending the abolition of the puppet organs. At 9:00 AM on the 29th, the Yuguan Japanese Garrison Commander, Ochiai, assisted Yin Chunsong in leading the police force to Haiyang to take office, restoring the county government after the Yuguan Incident. The various miscellaneous troops stationed there did not come out to obstruct. At noon, Yin Tong returned to Tangshan and took the evening train back to Tianjin with Lei Shourong to report on the receiving process. Yin Tong mentioned that he had originally planned to go to Changchun, but the trip was cancelled upon learning of Mutō's death. The opening of traffic between Beining and Yuguan can also be realized soon. The eastern route counties have generally been received smoothly. Qian'an County is waiting for County Director Lu to arrive in Tangshan, and Li Jichun will send people to assist in the reception. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tangshan) At noon on the 29th, Li Jichun assumed the position of Chairman of the Reorganization Committee for Miscellaneous Troops in the War Zone at the Jiaotong University headquarters. The committee was officially established and an official seal was used. Li has telegraphed He and Huang to report this. All Salvation Army armbands will be cancelled from the 29th. The new organization is expected to be implemented by the end of the month. Also, the so-called East Asian Allied Army, consisting of 5,000 men under Li Shoushan, departed from Zunhua and passed through the city in the evening, transported on puppet Fengshan Railway cars towards Guanwai. The large contingent passed through the streets of Tangshan, with complete weapons and uniforms, and high morale. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Huairou County Director Xu Wenquan arrived at the county seat at 1:00 PM on the 29th, and was welcomed into the city by the outgoing county director, who accompanied him in the receiving process. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Tong and Lei Shourong arrived in Beiping at midnight on the 29th. Yin said that Linyu County Director Yin Shousong had originally planned to lead the security team to enter Linyu County to take over, but was refused by the Japanese, and the plan failed. The Linyu County Government will move to Haiyang Town to operate. Currently, except for Qian'an, all eight counties have been received. Regarding the transportation issue on the Beining Railway, the first step will be to restore traffic between Beiping and Tangshan. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Miyun began receiving at 3:00 PM on the 29th. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tangshan telegram: Linyu County was received this afternoon. Yin Tong, Lei Shourong, and others are scheduled to return to Beiping by special train tonight. Shi Yousan's troops will be transported to Yutian immediately for reorganization. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the receiving of the eastern route, the Japanese side has objections to the number of security police, causing the receiving train to stop in Qinhuangdao. The receiving commissioner Yin Tong and others are currently negotiating with the Japanese side. Tao Shangming left Beiping for Tianjin this morning to negotiate with the Japanese side. As for the county directors of the northern route Miyun, Huairou, and Jixian, they left this morning at 4:00 AM with eighty security police officers by long-distance bus. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tongzhou telegram: The Japanese and puppet troops originally stationed in Jixian city have now withdrawn. The new county director, Sun Weishen, along with sixty security police officers and various staff members, as well as a Japanese person named Lin Wenxiang, passed through Tongzhou around 8:00 AM this morning to take over. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Miyun County Director Sun Shutang, Huairou County Director Xu Wenquan, leading personnel from various bureaus and fifty security team members, went to Miyun this morning to handle the receiving, and will then proceed to Huairou to receive. It is scheduled to be completed today. If time does not permit, Huairou will be received tomorrow. Lieutenant Colonel Chayama of the Japanese Embassy was originally scheduled to go to Miyun with Sun and others today to meet the commander of the Japanese Suzuki Brigade, but the trip was cancelled due to unforeseen circumstances. Jixian County Director Sun Weishen, accompanied by liaison officer Lin Wenxiang (a Japanese national) and fifty security team members, traveled to Tongzhou this morning by car, and then transferred to Jixian to receive. Due to the difficulties caused by the puppet troops and the prevalence of bandits, the reception is facing many obstacles, and it will be difficult to complete within two or three days. The receiving of Zunhua will be resolved soon after the receiving of Jixian is negotiated. It is said that the puppet troops in that area belong to Zhao Yi's troops. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Tong left Yuguan this morning to return to Tangshan because Yuguan has been received. He arrived in Tangshan at noon and met with Lei Shourong. He left Tangshan at 3:00 PM and is expected to arrive in Beiping tonight to report the receiving process to Huang. Liu Shisun telegraphed Beiping to report that the issue of Shi Yousan's troops in Qinhuangdao can also be resolved and that they will be transferred to Yutian for reorganization. Liu is scheduled to depart from Qinhuangdao for Beiping tomorrow morning to report everything to Huang. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Two more trains carrying reorganized puppet troops departed from Tangshan for Machang at 3:00 PM this afternoon. The Japanese army sent armored cars to escort them to Xugezhuang before returning to Tangshan. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Tao Shangming arrived in Tianjin from Beiping at noon on the 29th and stated that the negotiations for the receiving of the northern route have been successfully concluded. Sun Shutang of Miyun and Xu Wenquan of Huairou went to receive them on the morning of the 29th, and there should be no further problems. The situation in Jixian is complicated, and County Director Sun Weishen also departed from Beiping on the morning of the 29th. It is still uncertain whether the reception can be completed. Zunhua County Director Pei Huaxing and the County Director of Shulu were ordered by the Provincial Government to expedite the handover of affairs and immediately go to Zunhua to receive. The commander of the Suzuki Brigade stated regarding the northern route counties: 1. The county directors and public security bureau chiefs should be reimbursed for private funds advanced during the receiving. 2. Officials who have maintained local achievements during the extraordinary period should be allowed to continue in office. He has notified the receiving personnel of this. The receiving of the political power in Dushan and Xinglong counties, both located outside the Great Wall, may be difficult to accomplish for the time being. He will go to Tangdong within the next few days to assist in the receiving. Whether to appoint supervisors is still under consideration. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Provincial Government received reports from the county directors of Luanxian, Leting, and Changli stating that they have successfully completed the receiving. There have been no reports from Funing and Lulong. Ochiai, the Garrison Commander of Yuguan, accompanied Linyu County Director Yin Shousong to Haiyang Town on the morning of the 29th to receive, but opposed the establishment of the county government in Linyu County. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to reliable news from Tangshan, Linyu was received by China this afternoon. Except for Qian'an and Lulong, where bandit activity is still rampant, all territories east of the Luan River are now under Chinese jurisdiction. This morning, the county magistrates of Miyun and Huairou and other counties have traveled from Beiping to take office by car, each accompanied by one hundred special police officers. It is expected that the Japanese troops stationed in Miyun will withdraw to the Great Wall within a few days. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Political News: Among the counties in the northern route being received, Miyun is reported to be facing difficulties because the Suzuki Brigade is still stationed in the county. Tao Shangming personally went to negotiate and reach a compromise before leading Miyun County Director Sun Shutang, Huairou County Director Xu Wenquan, Jixian County Director Sun Weishen, and liaison officers to Miyun on the 25th to meet with Suzuki. Suzuki expressed a warm welcome to our receiving personnel and introduced the county directors to facilitate negotiations. Everything went smoothly. When Tao inquired about the brigade's withdrawal date, he was told that the brigade is scheduled to withdraw from the Great Wall line by the end of the month after the receiving is completed. Tao has reported all the receiving details to the Political Reorganization Committee. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qinhuangdao) Regarding the receiving of Linyu, Yin Tong, Liu Shisun, and County Director Yin negotiated in Yuguan, and the results were extremely satisfactory. Upon arriving in Yuguan, Yin and others first met with Commander Ochiai. Ochiai expressed great sincerity, stating that the current Linyu County Government is still in Haiyang, which is fifteen miles from Qinhuangdao, so the police force must first retreat to Qinhuangdao before proceeding. The location for the county government after the receiving can be freely determined by the government. Yin and others were satisfied. They also visited Brigade Commander Hattori and his staff officer Yazaki, who also expressed great goodwill. There are no problems with the receiving. If it does not rain on the 29th, Commander Ochiai will personally accompany our receiving personnel to Haiyang because a small number of miscellaneous troops are still stationed there, and there is concern about unexpected changes. If peaceful receiving is possible, that is ideal. Otherwise, the Japanese side is willing to take responsibility for resolving it. Our police force will temporarily remain in Qinhuangdao and will be stationed there after the receiving is completed. Furthermore, some miscellaneous troops are stationed in Zunhua and other places, numbering about six or seven thousand. The Japanese army is also willing to take responsibility for resolving this by escorting them out of the pass. It is estimated that the day this matter is resolved will be the day traffic is restored, no later than the deadline for the Dalian meeting. Yin and others expressed satisfaction with the results of the various issues. They took a specially prepared Japanese armored car back to Qinhuangdao at 8:30 PM and telegraphed the results of the negotiations to Beiping and Tianjin, respectively. The problem with Shi's troops has been resolved, and they will still be deployed to Yutian. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yesterday, the Chinese personnel receiving Yuguan had a misunderstanding with the Japanese troops there. Eventually, two special trains carrying police officers and county directors arrived in Shanhaiguan to arrange for the receiving. Haiyang Town will be received first, followed by Linyu and Shanhaiguan. The areas that have already been recovered include Tangshan, Luzhou, Fengning, Changli, and Ninghe. North of Beiping, due to heavy rain, the roads are impassable, preventing the receiving from taking place as scheduled. The last batch of soldiers to be disbanded under Li Jichun passed through Tianjin yesterday. The train carried 1,400 people from Tangshan, but hundreds deserted before arriving in Tianjin. It is reported that many of these deserters were killed or injured because they jumped off the moving train. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e7">Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek Issue Important Telegrams on the Current Situation <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>"The Fundamental Strategy for National Salvation Lies in Strengthening National Power</p>
<p>The Notion of Using Military Force Internally is Not Only Unbearable to Utter, But Also Unbearable to Hear"</p>
<p>President Wang and Chairman Chiang in Guling issued a special telegram on the current situation as follows:</p>
<p>To all provincial and municipal party departments, military and political institutions, and organizations: Today, the fundamental strategy for national salvation lies in strengthening national power. Without strong national power, rural areas will be bankrupt, and industry will be immature. Therefore, commerce will decline invisibly. Apart from developing the productive forces of the people, there is no other way to strengthen national power. However, banditry is rampant and a scourge within. The red flames are engulfing everything, and people are reduced to beasts. If it is not eliminated, not only will the people have no peace and security, but all plans will be hindered. Even defending the borders and resisting foreign aggression will not be effectively implemented. The central government is deeply concerned about this. Therefore, it has gathered all the troops and is making every effort to suppress the bandits, aiming to eliminate the bandit scourge and save the people in the shortest possible time. At the same time, it is focusing on rectifying officialdom and clarifying military discipline so that the lives and property of the people can be protected. It has also determined to use cotton and wheat loans for agricultural and industrial construction, and will never divert them to increase military expenditure. This combination of addressing both the symptoms and the root causes is indeed the only viable strategy for national survival and preservation today. Because the national crisis has reached this point, those who are internally weak will abandon themselves, and those who approach the situation lightly will only exacerbate the disaster. The only way is to do our best while establishing the minimum limit for national survival. We will steadfastly adhere to our repeated declarations not to sign treaties of cession or recognition, and we will not waver. If that limit is exceeded, we will not hesitate to make any sacrifice. As for the sympathy of international justice, we welcome it. We also need economic and technical assistance, but this is only to help the nation survive and stand on its own. It is by no means to rely on foreign forces to undermine sovereignty, nor to depend on foreign capital for management, and certainly not to use it for manipulation, which would only create new disputes in East Asia and the world. We firmly believe that domestic peace and international stability are the most necessary environments for the nation-building process, and we will strive to achieve them with all our strength. This is what we sincerely declare to both China and the outside world. Today's China is beset by both external aggression and internal turmoil. Without the sincere unity and concerted efforts of all the people in the country, there is no way to save it. Even if there are internal problems, they should be resolved by setting aside emotions and clarifying the facts. The notion of using military force internally is not only unbearable to utter, but also unbearable to hear. The conflict in Chahar Province in recent months is one example. The central government is deeply concerned about Feng Yuxiang's actions in Chahar Province and fears that they will endanger the nation. However, if Feng Yuxiang can accept the following principles: 1. Do not arbitrarily establish various military and political titles that would cause Chahar Province to break away from the central government, hinder unified government orders, and gradually become a second puppet government. 2. Do not hinder the central government's border defense plans, which would lead to outward strength but inner weakness and turn Chahar Province into a repeat of Jehol's situation. 3. Do not indiscriminately recruit disbanded soldiers and bandits, which would overburden the people and endanger local order. 4. Do not employ communist leaders to spread red flames, which would bring endless disaster to North China. The central government believes that the above points are not only related to the survival of Chahar Province but also to the security of the entire country, and cannot be tolerated or compromised. If these principles are accepted, the central government will also sincerely cooperate and is willing to share the burden and maintain it from beginning to end. In short, the national crisis today is so severe, and the communist scourge is so rampant. We can only endure humiliation and bear the heavy responsibility, strive for peace, and implement the fundamental strategy of national survival and preservation. At present, it is not appropriate to create complications that endanger the foundation. The central government colleagues encourage each other in this way and hope that all Chinese will understand.

<p>Sun Ke Passed Through Nanjing on His Way to Xunyang</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xuezhong came to Beiping this morning to say that he was previously summoned to Lushan by telegram from Chiang, but was unable to depart due to busy schedule. Now, he has received another telegram stating that the receiving in Luandong is important and that he need not go, so the trip to Lushan is cancelled. Five counties in Luandong have been received, and Linyu has not yet been received. The remnants of Li Jichun's reorganized puppet troops have been transported to Machang, but few remain due to desertion along the way. They will be sent back to their places of origin and disbanded. There is still no solution to Shi Yousan's troops. He came here to attend the Relief Committee meeting and will return to Tianjin tomorrow. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Huang Fu was summoned by telegram from Chiang to Lushan to participate in a meeting to discuss the Chahar affair.

<p>(Nanjing) When Huang Bingheng was the director of the Aviation Administration, he drafted a five-year plan for the construction of the air force, but it could not be implemented due to the tight national treasury.

Within three years, the minimum level of air force construction must be able to create a self-defense force. Furthermore, the administration is currently drafting an air defense exercise plan with an 18-month training period. It is planned to hold a large-scale air defense exercise in the capital first in October next year, and then gradually promote it to other provinces and cities. (29th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The departure date of Xinjiang Inspection Commissioners Peng Zhaoxian and Gong Bicheng has been repeatedly changed, and it is still uncertain whether they will go. The discussions between Chiang and Wang at the Lushan Conference on the Xinjiang issue were prompted by the international attention drawn to the two incidents in Xinjiang, especially by the excessive propaganda by the United Kingdom, France, and Russia. If the government does not handle it properly, not only will the credibility of the central government be lost, but it will also provoke the intentions of strong neighbors.

<h3 id="e37">French Occupation of Nine Small Islands in Guangdong Sea <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Today, as national difficulties persist and foreign invasions increase, the occupation of nine small islands in the Guangdong Sea has been reported. These nine small islands are located between Vietnam and the Philippines, around 10 degrees north latitude and 115 degrees east longitude. They have traditionally been inhabited by Chinese fishermen and recognized internationally as Chinese territory. However, in April of this year, a French ship suddenly sailed there, raised its national flag, and declared occupation. The illegal nature of this seizure is evident without investigation. Although the area is only about 300 square miles, since it is part of our territory, the loss of even an inch of land cannot be tolerated. The interests at stake are not only economic, but the infringement on territorial sovereignty is a great blemish on national dignity. Therefore, the people of this nation must firmly support and fight to the end, and not treat it lightly simply because it is "remote and uncivilized."</p>
<p>Since the news of the French occupation of the nine islands spread, China has been slow in its deliberations and has not yet decided how to respond. In Japan, however, it has attracted serious attention. According to Japanese reports, France has docks in Saigon and Guangzhou Bay capable of accommodating 10,000-ton cruisers. This is because they intend to build an airbase on the occupied nine islands and equip it with submarines, in order to gain control of the South China Sea. However, from our observations, the reason for France's sudden act of encroachment is not necessarily a premeditated ambition, but rather an emulation of bad examples and an opportunistic grab. Since the September 18th Incident, the French have long recognized the timid mentality and non-resistance of the Chinese people. They secretly envied the ease with which the Japanese achieved complete victory, and thus used similar tactics to seize a share of the spoils of aggression. Their thinking seems to be: "China can abandon the resource-rich Northeast, so why can't they give up a small, desolate island? China can lose over three million square miles of land, so why can't they concede a square mile of territory?"</p>

<p>French Occupation of Nine Small Islands in Guangdong Sea</p>
<p>Is there Really No Imperialist Motive?</p>
<p>(Washington) According to some Japanese newspapers, the United States has been negotiating to obtain a new naval base on Dongshan Island, southwest of Xiamen. Acting Secretary of State Phillips declared, "This news is completely absurd and not worth discussing."</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the news from foreign countries about the nine small islands between Borneo, Vietnam, and the Philippines, the situation obtained in Paris is as follows: On April 13, 1930, the French government, in accordance with the conditions stipulated by international law, occupied the largest of the nine small islands, Spratly Island, by the gunboat "Malicieuse." At that time, due to seasonal winds, it was not possible to occupy all the subordinate islands at the same time. It was not until April 7th to 12th this year that the remaining islands were completely occupied by the avisos "Astrolobe" and "Alérte." These small islands are only reefs and sandbars, with hardly any inhabitants, and are often submerged by seawater. Their location is in a dangerous area of the ocean. In order to facilitate communication between France's Asian and Oceanic territories, it is necessary to install navigational aids on these islands. None of the clauses in the Washington Nine-Power Treaty prohibit the occupation of these small islands. Moreover, Paris believes that Spratly Island, one of these small islands, has been occupied by France for over three years, and the Chinese government has not protested or reserved its rights. (29th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The well-known journalist Saint-Brice published an article in "Le Journal" defending France's occupation of about ten small islands between Vietnam and the Philippine archipelago, titled "Occupation Without Any Imperialist Significance." It stated, "France intends to occupy these islands in order to establish navigational facilities and install buoys for navigation, as the area is full of coral islands and navigation is extremely dangerous. This action by France is in the public interest and has no intention of establishing a new naval base. France already has territories within the Chinese seas and has no need to seek anything else. Even if people want to distort the facts, they cannot succeed, because this action has no imperialist significance." (28th Havas Dispatch)</p>

(28th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Athens The commander of an Italian torpedo boat today ordered the raising of the Italian flag on the three uninhabited Greek islands of Kinaros, Mavriagkalos, and Daéia. The Greek Minister of the Navy has begun to investigate the matter. According to Greek political circles, the Italian commander's action must be due to a misunderstanding.

<p>French Investment Totals 100 Million Francs</p>
<p>(Tokyo) France has long planned to invest in "Manchukuo." As a result of repeated negotiations with Japan, the plan has made concrete progress after the arrival in Japan of Dori Pierre, a member of the French Overseas Development Research Committee. Japan and France have organized a joint investment research committee for Manchuria. The founding meeting was held at the Tokyo Kaikan at noon on the 29th, and a declaration was issued. The French investment amounts to a total of 100 million francs, all private capital. Mr. Wen Duo is expected to go to Manchuria soon to investigate various projects. The full text of the declaration is as follows: France's investment in Manchuria and Mongolia is welcomed by both Japan and Manchukuo. Due to its relationship with the League of Nations, the French government cannot recognize the existence of "Manchukuo." However, there is no obstacle to the private sector and Japan jointly using investment and industrial power in Manchuria and Mongolia; on the contrary, it is undoubtedly beneficial. Moreover, there is no conflict of interest between Japan and France in the Far East. The arrival in Japan of Mr. Dori Pierre, a member of the French Overseas Development Association Research Committee, and the organization of this committee with Japan, is led by French financial and industrial groups.

Rumors of assassination spread throughout the imperial capital for a time, and the people were shaken. Later, the Japanese authorities vigorously suppressed the rumors, saying that the rumors were caused by the Japanese police's deep concern about the stability of public order in the four eastern provinces and their unwillingness to announce the details in time, leading to the spread of rumors.

The committee is currently seeking members, and the first meeting is tentatively scheduled for early September. The first issues to be reviewed are land and air routes connecting Japan and Manchuria, and then internal railways. Because the railway lines built by political party cabinets tend to be aimed at expanding party power and disregarding local industries, it has been decided to review them again. Therefore, Prime Minister Saitō and Railway Minister Mitsuchi held an important meeting. The chairman will be concurrently held by Prime Minister Saitō. In addition to the ministers of finance, interior, railways, army, navy, communications, and colonial affairs, there are also Mizuno Rentarō, Inoue Kyushirō, Shiba Chūzaburō, Yamamoto Jōtarō, and Machida Chūji.

<p>Japanese Ministry of Communications Plans</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Communications has decided to open an air transport service between Japan and Taiwan. It purchased land outside Taipei in the 7th year of Showa (1932) budget in preparation for building an airfield, but due to various reasons, the plan failed to materialize. Recently, voices calling for the realization of the air route between Japan and Taiwan have been growing, so the Ministry of Communications has decided to proceed with preparations for building the Japan-Taiwan air route. The first year's expenses of 140,000 yen were included in the air transport subsidy fee in the 7th year of Showa budget (total expenses for the eleven-year plan are 8,120,000 yen). After this budget is approved, an airfield will be built outside Taipei, and an intermediate stopover and wind measurement station will be set up near Naha, Okinawa Prefecture, between Fukuoka and Taipei. The cost of this project is scheduled to be completed in the 10th year of Showa (1935), and aviation can begin on April 1 of that year. The distance between Fukuoka and Taipei is 1,600 kilometers, and it currently takes four days by ship, but after this aviation plan is realized, it will only take ten hours to reach the other party, which will mark a new era in transportation between Japan and Taiwan.

<p>Aims to Complete the Goal of Restoring National Purchasing Power as Soon as Possible</p>
<p>Preparing to Implement New Financial Plan Next Month</p>
<p>(Washington) It is heard that the US government is now preparing to implement a great new financial plan in August. At that time, the authorities will decide what action should be taken regarding the current monetary situation. A secretary to President Roosevelt answered a question today, mentioning the rumor that President Roosevelt has decided not to use his power to reduce the gold content of the dollar, saying that the US president's policy on the dollar has not changed. The White House has been receiving thousands of telegrams supporting the US president's industrial recovery movement, as well as a large number of signed employment contracts. Post offices everywhere report that merchants are rushing to register, indicating their implementation of employment contracts, and many are asking about the implementation methods of the government's plan. Many merchants claim to be willing to increase wages as much as possible, but they are asking what will replace money in the future. Today, the Chicago National Automobile Industry Business Conference decided on industrial regulations based on a 30-hour work week, a minimum wage of 40 to 43 cents per hour, and no child labor. (28th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to US government officials, the US president has abandoned the policy of depreciating the price of gold to increase prices until the actual increase in prices is effectively guaranteed, but also has no intention of interfering with foreign exchange to maintain the stability of the price of gold. In the coming period, the government will rely on the recovery of all industries to complete the goal of restoring the national people's purchasing power to the level of 1925. A person close to the government claimed that for the time being, there will be no more direct actions to depreciate the value of gold, and it may never happen again. At present, if there is another attempt to depreciate the value of gold, it will lead to excessive speculation. The US government is now eager to know how much of the recent rise in prices is due to increased purchasing power and increased demand, and how much is due to speculation. The previous implementation of a moderate inflation policy did help raise prices, but part of the reason was indeed due to speculation. US government experts mostly feel that it would be unwise to take further action to depreciate the value of gold until this matter is clarified. As for interfering with the exchange market, it is only necessary to allow gold exports or increase the circulation of greenbacks and reserve bank notes, because the price of gold can be stabilized at any time. Several cabinet members currently believe that prices can be increased without resorting to severe inflationary measures. However, government departments will continue to implement public works projects with inflationary effects. As for exporting gold and increasing the number of circulating banknotes, they are only a kind of prepared power. However, the US president himself has not yet expressed his views on this matter.

<p>(Washington) It was heard here tonight that the US president had instructed Hull to go to the president's private residence in Hyde Park in New York after returning to the country. There have been rumors that Hull may resign as Secretary of State. The president left Washington at midnight today and will not return to the White House until the beginning of September. Political circles believe that his invitation to Hull to go directly to his private residence has great significance, but there are different rumors about the resignation. Some believe that the president is already disappointed with Hull, while others say that Hull is passively wanting to resign because of the repeated changes in the United States' policy at the economic conference. However, Hull's friends say that there is no major disagreement between the two, and it is likely that the president only wants to talk to Hull about international issues. The president is eager to discuss the two issues of recognizing Soviet Russia and the European Gold Bloc countries' actions to stabilize the exchange market, and it is expected that there will be no talk of resignation at that time. After the US president goes to his private residence, according to White House news, he will still work as usual. He has already invited some journalists to Hyde Park and will make important diplomatic talks. It is also possible that some diplomats will go to discuss modifying war debts.

<p>(London) Professor Gregory has published a paper in "The Economist" magazine discussing the silver agreement. The content is divided into two main points: ㈠ If general commodity prices do not rise, then the rise in silver prices will not be beneficial. ㈡ The silver agreement may not achieve its intended purpose. It is said that from 1924 to 1929, the silver consumption in the Far East accounted for 66% of the total global consumption. Because the Far Eastern countries are buyers, they are in a major position regarding the strength and weakness of the silver market. However, the rise and fall of the purchasing power of the Far Eastern countries is determined by the quantity of their exported goods and the gold value of these goods. Therefore, if the value of silver rises compared to gold or the pound, and the value of Far Eastern goods does not rise simultaneously, then the exports of the Far Eastern countries will inevitably decrease, and the goods of various industrial countries will also be exported continuously, which will inevitably lead to an imbalance in the silver market, and the law of supply and demand will inevitably be disturbed. From this point of view, if the rise in silver prices is to be beneficial, then the price of goods exported from the Far East must rise at the same time, so that the purchasing power of silver will increase accordingly, and the consumption of the Far Eastern countries will gradually develop. Professor Gregory is also not satisfied with the provision in the silver agreement that several governments store large quantities of raw silver, because after the agreement expires, there will be no restrictions on the sale of stored silver by these countries, which poses a threat to the silver market, and it is impossible to raise silver prices at this time.

The government does not want to interfere with the tripartite talks between Lancashire and Japanese and Indian industrialists regarding the cotton textile industry. However, it will do its best to assist the Lancashire representatives. As for Ceylon's refusal to give preferential treatment to the import of Lancashire products, it will also be considered.

<p>Refusal to Grant India Diplomatic Power</p>
<p>Reason: To Promote Independence</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the India-Japan negotiations, the Japanese government repeatedly requested that the British government grant the Indian government diplomatic power. The British government has deeply studied the purpose of this proposal put forward by Japan and believes that the Japanese side intends to use this as an opportunity to help promote India's independence. Foreign Minister Simon then replied to Ambassador Matsudaira, rejecting this proposal. The main points of the British reply are as follows: ㈠ The Indian government has special significance in the British Constitution, and the United Kingdom cannot grant it independent diplomatic negotiating power. ㈡ The Indian independence movement is becoming increasingly fierce and cannot be used as a temporary convenience to promote the independence trend. If independent negotiating power is granted, the government must be responsible to the parliament and be questioned by it. ㈢ The British government will, within the scope of possibility, not create difficulties in the results of the Japan-India contact and will not fundamentally change the original proposal.

However, the British government is willing to guarantee that the British government does not want to make fundamental changes to any commercial agreements concluded between Japan and India. The main idea of the reply was conveyed by Ambassador Matsudaira in the UK to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>Japan Believes Britain is Using Means to Reject Japanese Goods</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a report from Consul Kuwajima in Mombasa (British territory in Africa) to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, British merchants in the area have recently felt threatened due to the entry and exit of Japanese goods. On the 25th, the Joint General Assembly of the East African Chamber of Commerce resolved to revise the Congo Treaty and the League of Nations Mandate Terms, because these two items restrict the freedom of East Africa's finance and economy, making it impossible for the United Kingdom to implement its special privileges, and there is a risk of promoting the entry and exit of Japanese merchants and immigrants. The so-called Congo Treaty refers to the commercial treaty based on the most-favored-nation treatment signed between the colonies in the Congo Basin and Japan and major European powers. The League of Nations Mandate Terms recognize the right of League of Nations member states to have most-favored-nation treatment in the area. The rejection of Japanese goods movement in Mombasa is, according to the observation of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a means by which the British reject Japanese goods, and its trend is extremely noteworthy.

<p>Berlin, July 29 (National News) Yesterday was the 50th birthday of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. All German newspapers celebrated warmly, calling Mussolini one of Europe's greatest statesmen, unseen for many years, and praising Mussolini's rich ideals, clear mind, and courageous actions, which enabled him to lead the masses.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Italian-Hungarian Talks Successful <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Rome, July 28 (Havas) Hungarian Prime Minister General Gömbös told representatives of the foreign press, "The purpose of my visit to Italy is to study various issues concerning the European situation with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. As a result of my talks with Mussolini, the Italian and Hungarian governments are very pleased that we have a consensus on various economic and political issues."</p>
<p>Budapest, July 28 (National News) The newspapers in the Hungarian capital have thoroughly reported on the talks between Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös and Mussolini in Italy, praising the closeness of their views and the success of the results, and stating that the revision of the treaty that the Hungarian government hopes for is a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p>The newspapers all stated that Italian public opinion has expressed full support for the revision of the treaty, and French public opinion is also gradually moving towards coordination.</p>
<p>Berlin, July 28 (National News) The Berliner Tageblatt recently published a detailed report on the results of Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös's visit to Italy. Its conclusion is that the signing of the Four-Power Pact has not only not harmed the relations between Italy and Hungary but has also increased the friendship between the two countries because Italy has not abandoned its long-standing claim to find a way for Hungary to revise the peace treaty after signing the pact. Furthermore, an understanding has been reached between Italy and Hungary regarding the Danube River basin issue. On the one hand, Hungary supports Italy's various attempts in the Danube River, and Italy recognizes Hungary's economic relations with the Danube River basin. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will continue to strive to obtain the consent of the other three countries within the Four-Power Pact to resolve the Danube River and Balkan issues. In addition, ways to increase the economic relations between Italy and Hungary have also been established. However, the countries of the Little Entente have apparently been greatly disturbed by the Hungarian Prime Minister's visit to Italy this time, and the opposition arguments made by Romanian Minister of Justice Bobuvisy can also represent a glimpse of the current emotions of the countries of the Little Entente. Bobuvisy recently published a speech stating that since a Four-Power Pact has been signed, all talk of treaty revision has been abandoned for ten years, but if this matter is brought up again, it should first be stated that the so-called treaty revision is purely a matter of power and that revision means war.</p>

<p>Rehe is rich in natural resources, surpassing all other provinces in Manchuria and Mongolia. However, due to the lack of detailed surveys, it is difficult to know the extent of its mineral deposits. Upon examination, the entire area of Rehe is mostly mountainous. According to geological classification, it can be divided into mountainous zones, plateau zones, and desert zones. Each of these zones has its own geological characteristics. The mountainous zone is composed of gneiss, Paleozoic strata, Mesozoic strata, and Tertiary strata, followed by igneous rocks such as granite, basalt, quartz trachyte, and porphyry. The plateau zone belongs to the Quaternary strata and the widely distributed alluvial loess layer. The desert zone has porphyry outcrops. Gneiss, including hornblende gneiss, biotite gneiss, augen gneiss, quartz gneiss, and lamprophyre, is widely distributed from the Guoding Mountains, the Daqing Mountains, to the southwest of Jinzhou, occupying a vast area especially from the vicinity of Baoguo Temple to Jianchang. The Paleozoic strata are composed of argillite, sandstone, hard sandstone, limestone, and tuff. In parts of the Daqing Mountains and various locations in the Phoenix Mountains, as well as near Chengde and Chaoyang, carbonaceous rocks are exposed in the upper layers. The direction of these strata generally extends eastward from 30 to 60 degrees north, with a dip of 50 to 60 degrees to the southeast, penetrating granite, porphyry, and basalt. The Mesozoic strata consist of thick layers of porphyry, tuff, agglomerate, and angular breccia, containing a carbonaceous layer in the upper Jurassic period, overlying the irregular Paleozoic strata. The direction of the strata extends from northeast to southwest, distributed in Qinghebianmen, Jinzhou, Jianchang, Xinqiu, Yuejiagou, Chaoyang, Dachengzi, and the Binggou coalfield. The Tertiary strata are composed of ocher sandstone, breccia, shale, and tuff, containing quartz trachyte, basalt, and andesite, distributed in Xitumote, Jinchanggou Liang, Chaoyang, and Dongtumote, Xinlitu. The main component of the Quaternary is the alluvial loess layer, which is widely distributed. In low-lying areas, yellowish-brown rocks accumulate everywhere, with a thickness of 20 to 30 to 130 feet. The extent of mineral resources in Rehe Province is currently difficult to determine. However, the vast coal seams of the Middle Ages in the Songling Mountains and the Paleozoic strata of the Yinshan Mountains, containing gold and silver, have long been established. Other minerals such as copper, iron, lead, crude oil, asbestos, soda, glass stone, sulfur, silica, crystal, gems, fluorite, salt, and limestone are abundantly buried everywhere. The largest product is bituminous coal, extending from Fuxin through Chaoyang to Jinxi County, as well as the main and tributary basins of the Laohe River, including Fengning and Pingquan counties, all of which are inexhaustible mineral veins. Gold and placer gold are abundant in the main and tributary basins of the Luan River, including Fengning, Chengde, Luanping, and Longhua counties, and the main tributary basins of the Laohe River and its tributary Yingjin River, including Chaoyang and Lingyuan counties. The products from the lakes and marshes are supplied to Mongolian tribes and to the border regions of Heilongjiang, Hebei, Gansu, and Shanxi. The above refers to the area south of the Xilamulun River. As for the area north of the Xilamulun River, the useful mineral deposits are even richer but have not yet been mined. In other words, the minerals stored in the basin of the Laohe River, a tributary of the Xilamulun River, and the basin of the Yingjin River, a tributary of the Xilamulun River (i.e., in the main stream of the Xilamulun River and its northern regions).</p>
<p>The most prominent gold mines are in the Daheishan Mountains of Jinchanggou Liang, and the coal mines are centered in Chaoyang, extending from Fuxin County to the Kalaqin Left Banner, and centered in Chifeng, extending northeast to southwest, which are called mineral-producing zones. Other promising areas have not yet been investigated and are unknown. In the future, all depends on our efforts, and we should be able to discover them one by one.</p>
<p>In terms of geography, according to Tada Fumio, no geographers have thoroughly investigated the Rehe region. Previously, Percy Eyer of England, Merendorff of Germany, Dr. Ogawa Takuji of Japan, and recently Chertan of France, as well as Sven Hedin, a Swede who explored Mongolia, Central Asia, and Tibet, failed to obtain a complete picture. Therefore, in geography, Rehe is called a "dark zone." However, the important issues of this region have always been considered inconceivable by explorers and scholars from various countries. From the perspective of physical geography, this area is the intermediate mountainous zone between the flat Mongolian plateau, the low-lying northern part of China, and the Manchurian plains. On the Mongolian plateau, there are several stepped peneplains, and there is also a low-lying peneplain on the Liaodong Peninsula. How these are expressed and contrasted in this transitional zone is a major research question. From the perspective of climate, the Rehe region is a transitional zone between the arid desert region and the rainy, mild, and hot region. Therefore, research from a biogeographical perspective is quite interesting. As for human geography, this region was originally the border area between the Han, Mongolian, and Manchu ethnic groups. We should investigate the rise and fall of the distribution of their forces. The nomadic peoples living in the dry areas from the Caspian Sea to the Gobi Desert are very different from the agricultural peoples surrounding the monsoon region of Southeast Asia. How the cultures of these two peoples harmonize in the bordering area and form a cultural landscape is a matter for research. Therefore, judgment can only be made after our investigation and research. In summary, the importance of Manchurian and Mongolian resources to Japan is self-evident. At present, our country (Japan) has shifted from an agrarianism to an industrial nation. However, Japan's industrialization, in terms of technology and capital, is no longer a problem. The only obstacle is the lack of raw materials. Most of the important industrial raw materials produced in Japan, except for raw silk, are insufficient. Now, to seek raw material supplies in a safe area, we rely entirely on the Asian continent. In particular, from the perspective of defense in Manchuria and Mongolia, it is the key to the proper propagation of the Imperial Way. Other economic issues such as population and food issues, industrial raw material issues, and property market issues are related to Japan's survival. It is a region that supplies the resources that the Empire lacks. Therefore, the dispatch of this scientific survey team demonstrates the importance of our country's (Japan's) mission.</p>
<p>The above is translated from the special edition of the Osaka Asahi Shimbun dated July 23rd, which was published on the day the survey team departed for the first time. As for the team's actual survey report, according to the schedule, the first step of the survey will begin between Beipiao and Chaoyang from August 5th to 10th. It is expected that the Asahi Shimbun will receive the report on the 13th or 14th, and our newspaper should be able to translate and publish it successively on the 16th and 17th. The reporter has endless thoughts writing this. Our country has been in turmoil for more than twenty years, and there has been no peaceful year. The rulers have no time to develop resources, coupled with a lack of talent, resulting in the mysterious territories being given away, which is very regrettable.</p>

<p>Linchuan as a Military Center</p>
<p>Special dispatch from Linchuan: Linchuan, formerly known as Fuzhou, has convenient transportation and fertile land, and is one of the best counties in Jiangxi Province. However, since the county borders bandit areas, it has become the center of the Central Route Bandit Suppression Military. The passage of bandit suppression troops, the transport of ammunition and salaries to the front lines of Yihuang, Le'an, Chongren, Huangpi, Nanfeng, and Nancheng, all depend on this. Refugees from bandit areas also mostly gather here. The population in the city is increasing day by day, and the streets are also quite bustling. However, the business of the shops feels deserted, because the purchasing power of the general public is low. The Eighth Provincial Middle School, other government offices, and spacious private residences are also mostly borrowed by the stationed troops. The city's defensive works are constantly being repaired. Pedestrians are strictly checked. The search for bandits and their parties happens almost every day. The tension of bandit suppression is more severe than in Nanchang.</p>
<p>According to County Magistrate Xia of this county, the bandit suppression military has been going on for five years. The local burden has long exhausted its resources. Even taking the issue of yicha (corvée labor) as an example, in addition to the countless dispatches made earlier, in the past two weeks alone, another thousand people have been dispatched. The county government has no way to scrape together resources, so it has to recruit with county rewards. Those who can recruit thirty laborers are appointed as platoon leaders with a monthly salary of twenty yuan. Those who can recruit one hundred and twenty laborers are promoted to company commanders with a monthly salary of thirty yuan. Generally, those who are wealthy and have leadership desires, and</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Have some military experience come out to call for them and encourage them to take charge. The rice straw within thirty miles of the city has long been used up for military purposes. The desire for a stalk is as precious as wisdom. However, every time the troops set off, the paper required is still like snowflakes, saying that it is urgently needed and must be obeyed, or that it concerns bandit suppression and must not be delayed. Other temporary requisitions of various donations and taxes mostly gain the favor of the government but lose the hearts of the people, and are particularly thorny to comply with. Fortunately, the baojia system in the county is becoming more and more perfect, and the training of the Bao Wei Tuan (local defense corps) is effective, which can fulfill the responsibility of maintaining local security. The telephone network in each village and town has been completed, so there is no need to worry about a lack of response in case of a bandit alarm, etc.</p>
<p>The refugees gathered here are all from bandit areas and near bandit areas (war zones between soldiers and bandits), such as Jinxi, Chongren, Le'an, and other eight counties. According to the surveys of the county and township associations, there are a total of five thousand. Zhou Zuofu, the Special Commissioner of the Seventh Administrative Inspectorate District of Jiangxi Province, obtained a relief fund of five thousand yuan from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and distributed it by roll call in the public sports field, one yuan per person, and gave a small photo of Chiang Kai-shek. It took eight days to complete the matter. The refugees' clothes are mostly silk, and many of the old women wear large-edged and large-rolled, antique costumes, which almost make one suspect that they are not modern people, not genuine refugees. However, upon detailed inquiry, none of them had not abandoned their property and fields. It is particularly sad. As for the lower middle class, even if they want to escape, they do not have the strength. If they do not become bandits, they will be slaughtered, and their suffering is even more unimaginable. It is heard that after the distribution of relief, many refugees have returned to their hometowns one after another.</p>
<p>I visited a friend at headquarters and asked about the bandit situation. He provided a report from a certain regimental commander on the Yihuang defense line, which discussed the strengths and weaknesses of the bandits in detail. The general meaning is as follows: The bandits have three advantages: (1) The officers and soldiers all have political consciousness, so they can enforce strict military discipline and command as desired. They once peered at their battle line with a telescope and saw that even in the trenches, they would occasionally hold meetings and speeches. It can be seen that the movement of military politicization, even in wartime, is not relaxed. (2) They pay attention to propaganda. The bandits are in a favorable position, and are anesthetized by propaganda every day, and are unrepentant until death. However, they also print various slogans on paper and send them with the wind, or write them on wooden boards and float them downstream, in order to communize the good people and soldiers. (3) They are calm in battle. If the bandits take a defensive position, no matter how the National Army attacks, they will not easily counterattack, making it difficult to discern their weaknesses. Their shortcomings are not only one. However, the lack of supplies may be their fatal injury. Since the implementation of the red zone blockade policy, every ounce of salt has now risen to two yuan, and one sheng (pint) of rice is three yuan, making life extremely difficult. The clothes are also mostly tattered, etc. Later, my friend added that the number of bandit soldiers and officers who have surrendered and been admitted to the 感化院 (rehabilitation center) set up by the headquarters has reached more than five hundred. The lack of supplies on the bandit side is also a reason for the dispersal of the masses.</p>
<p>According to a cooperative investigator, the rural economic situation here has already shown a small-scale peasant economy centered on semi-tenant farmers. Income cannot cover expenses, and they mostly rely on cow-rolling (borrowing and pawning to survive), barely maintaining their lives. The need for relief is urgent. However, when we (the investigator refers to himself) went to promote the organization of cooperatives in order to restore rural prosperity, the general farmers were suspicious and often used the excuse that setting up another organization in the countryside would require an expense to politely decline. Therefore, although the call for promoting the organization of cooperatives has been sung for a long time, only seven have been formally established in practice. (July 20)</p>
<h3 id="e85">Past Events of the Fall of Nancheng <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Special dispatch from Nancheng: Going south from Linchuan, one gradually enters the bandit area. Nancheng and Nanfeng were once captured by bandits. Although they have now been recovered and heavily garrisoned, there are guerrilla forces of bandits who appear from time to time in the countryside more than five miles outside the city. Therefore, highway bridges and telegraph poles along the road are often burned, and car robbery is especially common. The military authorities are advocating the construction of bridges and碉樓 (fortified watchtowers) to maintain transportation, which will soon be put into practice.</p>
<p>I departed from Linchuan in the morning and arrived in Nancheng at noon. Along the way, many tall pine trees were planted on the slopes, and the early rice in the paddy fields was already ripe, with golden clouds as far as the eye could see. Farmers were busy harvesting. The car entered the county's警戒線 (perimeter security line), and both soldiers and civilians were subject to interrogation. The streets and alleys passed after getting off the car were mostly winding paths due to military obstacles. The walls on both sides were not only covered with slogans, but also had gun holes dug into them, leaving no gaps. Upon entering the city, one was inspected again, and government employees had to show their passports, and merchants had to show their badges. If they were villagers coming to the city to catch the market, in addition to wearing a 良民證章 (good citizen badge) on their chest, they also had to obtain a 通行路單 (pass) from the Baojia chief every day, with the following rules:</p>
<p>(1) This pass is limited to one person for one use (not restricting the number of uses, but the usage time is limited to one day). After the expiration, it must still be returned to the Bao chief for verification. (2) This pass is not allowed to be lent to others or lost, otherwise it will be reported to the county magistrate and treated as collusion with bandits. (3) This pass is valid within the county's jurisdiction and within twenty li (about six miles) of neighboring counties. (4) When people request a pass, they must pay one copper coin to the Bao chief as a paper and printing fee, but they must not overcharge or underpay.</p>
<p>From these pass rules, it can be seen that people near the bandit areas not only cannot move freely, but also occasionally have suspicions of colluding with bandits if they are not careful. Therefore, the general villagers, except for those who have to sell firewood in exchange for oil, salt, and groceries, otherwise they all regard entering the city as a fearsome thing. For example, if they want to sell pig manure, they would usually drive the pig into the city to earn a high price. At this time, they would only post a notice in the village, writing "So-and-so will slaughter a pig on such-and-such day, and is willing to sell it by the catty at a low price," etc. Those villagers who have wanted meat for a long time will then go to share it. Other miscellaneous grains and groceries are also mostly traded in this way. Also, although the pass only stipulates that one copper coin should be paid, in reality, two or even four coins are often collected. As for the so-called good citizen badge, it is a square inch of white cloth with the name, age, and address written on it, and stamped with a Baojia seal. Each badge costs four to five hundred cash, and it is especially troublesome to lose.</p>
<p>The streets in the city are mostly narrow, and even the store eaves on both sides are only two or three feet apart. The light is insufficient, and the air is especially difficult to breathe. The pedestrians are bustling and continuous, and most of them are refugees and soldiers. Notices for selling good houses and seeking to sell good fields are often seen on the streets and alleys.</p>
<p>I took the opportunity to visit the county government and was received by a certain section chief. According to him, the bandits captured the city for five days the year before last, forcing the Chamber of Commerce to raise funds and prepare food, and using local ruffians to search wealthy families for countless items of clothing, which were arbitrarily distributed on the Tianyi Mountain stage. If the people under the stage did not accept them, they would shout loudly, "Are you a capitalist?" Later, when they saw the iron birds (airplanes) flying, they scattered like birds and beasts. The fields in the semi-bandit area (i.e., the war zone between soldiers and bandits) have all been abandoned, and the rest can be cultivated as usual. It is heard that the arable land in the bandit area was initially distributed based on the population and the area of the bandits. Later, due to the small number of people and the large amount of land, production was encouraged. A method of collecting 20 catties out of every 100 catties of grain was used to concentrate food. Due to economic panic, three public bonds of 5 jiao (0.5 yuan), 1 yuan, and 1.5 yuan were issued. People between the ages of 16 and 35 all have the obligation to join the Red Army and 赤衛隊 (red guards). The masses mostly dare to be angry but dare not speak out, hoping that the National Army will advance and suppress them to relieve their suffering. Later, I asked him to introduce me to the Nanfeng government. He pointed to the high mountains twenty li (about six miles) away and said, "The car is likely to be robbed by bandits near this mountain. The situation in Nanfeng is roughly the same as here. If there is no important business, it is not necessary to go."</p>
<p>The money and grain taxes in this area, in addition to the regular and supplementary tax silver dollars, increase year by year, and there are also 公政捐 (public administration donations), 伕差捐 (corvée labor donations), 禾草捐 (rice straw donations), 保甲捐 (baojia donations), and 飛機測量捐 (airplane surveying donations), etc. The fields destroyed and occupied by the highway and county roads, which should be exempt from grain tax, have not been allowed, and the suffering they have endured is unspeakable.

<p>Eastern Hubei: Capturing Three Bandit Nests and Killing a Bandit Division Commander</p>
<p>Western Hubei: The Second Phase of General Suppression Surrounded and Attacked Wuyang Pass</p>
<p>Southern Hubei: Jiangxi Bandits Retreat and Two Divisions Led by Guo and Rong Jointly Suppress</p>
<p>Communication from Hankou: Since the large-scale mobilization of the bandit suppression army in Hubei Province, progress has been rapid. The forces of Kuang Jixun, He Long, Kong Hechong, etc., are on the verge of collapse again. Here is a comprehensive summary of the bandit suppression situation in various aspects:</p>
<h3 id="e87">Eastern Hubei <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The bandits in Eastern Hubei include the pseudo Twenty-fourth, Twenty-fifth, Twenty-eighth Armies, and various guerrilla forces, separately led by pseudo army commanders Liao Rongkun, Shen Zemin, and Lü Huanxian, all under the banner of Kuang Jixun. However, there has been no confirmed report on whether Kuang is in the army. The occupied bandit area, in addition to parts of Huangma and Luotian counties in Hubei Province, also extends to southern Henan and western Anhui. The Soviet government of the border area of the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui is located in Guojiahe, with Qiliping and Dushuihe as its important gateways. After Liu Zhenhua completed the deployment of various forces, he ordered a general suppression. The bandits knew they were no match, and on one hand, they stubbornly resisted by defending strategic locations, and on the other hand, they split up and fled. The main force of the Twenty-fifth Army, the 73rd and 74th Divisions, has been defeated by the troops sent by Liu. A pseudo division commander was killed on the spot, and countless bandits were killed. The Liang Guanying unit of the Twenty-fifth Route Army also came into contact with the main force of the bandits and fought fiercely for two days and nights. On the 26th, they recovered Dushuihe. On the 28th, they took advantage of the victory and occupied Guojiahe, destroying the pseudo government. The remnants of this force have now fled to Qiliping, and Liang's unit is chasing and suppressing them. One force in the Macheng area, about several thousand people, previously fled to Nanliuhe and Baishahe in the southern township of Lihuang, and some remained in Futianhe in Mashu. Recently, the Hao Mengling unit of the Fifty-fourth Division fought fiercely and captured the Futianhe bandit nest. The bandits who fled to Henan attempted to rescue them, so they returned from Nanliuhe and Baishahe to spy on Macheng and Luotian. Upon hearing the report, Liu Zhenhua ordered the entire Shangguan Yunxiang of the Forty-seventh Division to be transferred to Songziguan and Shengjiabao to prevent the bandits from going south. The headquarters of the division was moved to Luotian County to facilitate command. As for the Manchu conference convened by Liu, it was held in Manchu on the 28th. A precise study on the suppression and aftermath of the bandits in Eastern Hubei is being conducted. The conference is scheduled for three days and will be closed on the 30th.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Western Hubei <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The He bandits in Western Hubei have been entrenched in the Five Crane Mountains for a long time. The government army cannot drive straight in due to the difficulty of transporting supplies. However, precisely because the mountain paths are rugged, there is no way for the bandits to transport supplies either, and the blockade policy has achieved significant results. Xu Yuanquan, the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the Hubei-Hunan Border Region, who was ordered to supervise the suppression, officially took office on the 20th. After discussing with He Chengzun, the Director of the Pacification Affairs, he ordered a general suppression. Zhang Gang, the commander of the security team, and Jiang Zuojun, the commander of the New Third Brigade, served as vanguards, and first captured the Crane Peak bandit nest. The first phase of the suppression plan was completed. Soon after, the key points of Ximaping, Shadaoping, Hongtuxi, and Shihuiyao were successively occupied. The second phase of the suppression plan is now being implemented, surrounding and attacking the Wuyang Pass bandit nest. This place is where the He bandits are stationed in person, and their strength is relatively abundant. They are expected to hold on firmly. Xu has added the entire Pan Shanzhai brigade to the front line, setting a three-day deadline to recover the pass. Xu himself will go to Changyang on the 29th to supervise the army and telegraph the Sichuan and Hunan armies to guard the key points to prevent them from fleeing far.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Southern Hubei <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The remnants of the Kong bandits in Southern Hubei previously fled to the Xiutong area on the border of Jiangxi. Recently, taking advantage of the National Army's troop transfer, a part has fled into Hubei, and there are traces of red bandits in the Taizimiao, Fenghuangshan, and Fushou districts of Yangxin County, and they are very rampant. People are mostly fleeing to Qichun, where they are being received by Gu Renfa, the Special Commissioner of the Third Administrative Inspectorate District. Upon receiving the report, the Pacification Office telegraphed Guo Rudong, the commander of the Twenty-sixth Division, and Rong Jingfang, the commander of the Eighty-second Division, to send troops to jointly suppress them.

<h3 id="e90">Liu Xiang's Telegram to Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek on Bandit Suppression Opinions <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The Three Major Procedures for Bandit Suppression and Pacification of Sichuan</p>
<p>Reasons for Past Failures in Bandit Suppression</p>
<p>Politics Should Proceed Slowly During Military Times</p>
<p>Chongqing Correspondence: Liu Xiang, Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in Sichuan, sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and President Wang Jingwei of the National Government on the 23rd, outlining the procedures for bandit suppression and methods for managing the various armies. The following is an excerpt: "Yesterday, I received your order, specially appointing Xiang as Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in Sichuan, with all the armies in Sichuan under my command. I also received the issued letter of appointment and official seals, etc. Upon receiving this order, I was deeply apprehensive. Considering my limited abilities, how can I bear such a great responsibility? Xiang has been managing the army in Sichuan for many years and has some experience in suppressing communists and bandits. Regardless of my limitations, I humbly offer my humble opinion for your wise consideration. I believe that when discussing bandit suppression and pacification of Sichuan today, there should be clear procedures and distinctions that must not be confused. First, manage the various armies, unify their will, eliminate obstacles, and jointly stabilize the situation in Sichuan. Second, the armies should be sincerely and closely organized, assigned tasks, and eliminate the Red bandits. Third, unify the Sichuan administration and strive for construction. The above three points are necessary stages with fixed methods. If they are not clear or if the order is reversed, bandit suppression will actually support the bandits, and suppressing communism will instead create communism. The past is clear, and no one can violate this principle. Taking the Red bandits in northern Sichuan as an example, the various units have been suppressing them for more than half a year. Statistics show that the Yang, Tian, and Liu armies have more than ten brigades in total. They have burdened Sichuan and wasted resources, but they have not harmed the Red bandits in the slightest. Instead, they have been taken advantage of by the bandits, and Tongjiang and Bazhong have fallen again, which cannot be salvaged. The reasons for the failure can be stated as follows: (1) The various units defended against the bandits in their respective areas without close organization; (2) There was no appropriate political deployment, and there was no sufficient preparation for weapons and supplies. In addition, Liu defended Deng, which affected Tian's unit, and the armies had divided loyalties and many concerns. Therefore, although there were many troops, only a few could actually be used. With such bandit suppression, how could it not be suppressed by the bandits? According to recent intelligence, the bandits and government troops were not always in close contact. Sometimes the distance between them was very far, with gaps of hundreds of miles. However, the bandits did not dare to approach, which shows that the bandits' situation is not as fierce as rumored. Only the government side has no means of providing supplies, and transportation is failing, so they are often taken advantage of by the bandits, resulting in endless disasters. Therefore, bandit suppression without a plan is actually welcomed by the bandits, and its harm is far greater than not suppressing them at all. Xiang was born and raised in Sichuan, where his ancestors' graves are located. He respects and cherishes his homeland, and I believe that I am second to none. If there is a shortcut to take, I would have done my best to take it. However, in reality, there are many constraints that need to be eliminated. It seems roundabout, but it is not my intention. The situation in Sichuan is such that it cannot be delayed. I have decided to follow the above-mentioned procedures and proceed in earnest. In the shortest possible time, I will manage the various armies, promote their joint progress, and eliminate the banditry. Everything will be easily resolved. If it takes too long and there is no success, then I ask to be punished for the crime of misleading the country, to punish one to warn a hundred, starting with myself. However, at this time of managing the Sichuan army and eliminating obstacles, there are many doubts and tremors, and there are many words of speculation. I hope that you will thoroughly investigate and resolve the concerns. If you do not bother the eyes and ears of the common people and hastily patch things up, dealing with them in a piecemeal manner, then you are deceiving yourself and others, seeking temporary praise, and leaving great trouble for the future. Although Xiang is ignorant and incompetent, I dare not accept such an order. Furthermore, during military operations, it is most important to have a unified will. Political issues should be postponed for now. Issues such as organizing the provincial government and allocating powers are very important, but if they are raised now, they will only shake the will and divide the various units. This should be noted. Xiang has received special treatment, entrusted with full authority to suppress bandits and pacify Sichuan. I am always fearful and dare not claim credit. At the beginning of this assignment, I have to comprehensively consider the overall situation and carefully consider it. I dare not disobey your orders or delay the time, nor can I tolerate raising problems and repeating the mistakes of the past. Before reporting the new appointment, I am extremely worried and can only lay out my honest opinion, hoping that you will understand my foolish sincerity and secretly give me your guidance. I am in utmost fear and await your orders."</p>
<h3 id="e91">Establishment Period of the 19th Route Army Supplementary Division <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>All Units Have Arrived in the Province for Reorganization</p>
<p>The Brigade and Regiment Commanders Have Also Been Appointed</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: After the 19th Route Army's two columns supporting Rehe returned to their garrison, commanders Zhang Yan and Tan Qixiu were both promoted from Chief Commanders to Division Commanders. Zhang was appointed to the 49th Division and took office in Yongding a few days ago. Tan was appointed to the Supplementary Division and flew to the province a few days ago to discuss the division's reorganization plan with the Pacification Headquarters. It has been decided to combine the three regiments of the 19th Route Army Supplementary Brigade currently stationed downstream in Haicheng and Tong'an, the two regiments of the Security Brigade stationed in the provincial capital Xixiang, and the 2nd Special Service Regiment of the 19th Route Army stationed upstream in Minqing and Yongtai into one division. In addition to Tan Qixiu serving as Division Commander and concurrently Commander of the 1st Brigade, Chen Wei-yuan, Commander of the 2nd Security Brigade, will serve as Deputy Division Commander, Xiao Zu, Chief of Staff of the Supplementary Brigade Headquarters, will serve as Chief of Staff of the Division Headquarters, and Situ Fei, Commander of the 2nd Special Service Regiment, will serve as Commander of the 2nd Brigade. As for the Deputy Brigade Commander and Regiment Commander candidates, Tan and the Pacification Headquarters are currently discussing them, and they will likely be selected from the current regiment commanders of the Supplementary and Security Brigades and the battalion commanders of the Special Service Regiment. The Division Headquarters has selected the Liu Guanxiong family ancestral hall in Dusi Lane in the city, and Xiao Zu is supervising personnel to move in for office work and is starting to handle the reorganization matters. The upstream and downstream troops have been continuously arriving in the province in recent days and are stationed in the City Defense Office, City God Temple, Faha Temple, and Xijian and Zhejiang Guildhall outside the West Gate. Tan Qixiu and Xiao Zu are going to inspect and verify them, with a deadline of the end of the month. A portion of the old and weak will be eliminated, and the vacancies will be filled by new Guangdong and Guangxi recruits recruited by the New Soldier Training Office of the Pacification Headquarters. It is rumored that the most soldiers will be eliminated from the Security Brigade. As for the establishment date, it is set for August 1st, and the division, brigade, and regiment commanders will simultaneously take their oaths of office. After the reorganization of the Security Brigade, the important officers of the Brigade Headquarters will be transferred to the Pacification Headquarters as staff officers and adjutants. As for the garrison locations of the entire division, in addition to leaving a portion to maintain security in the provincial capital, the rest are planned to be deployed to Gutian, Minqing, Yongtai, and other counties near the province to carry out bandit suppression.

<p>In the urban area of this county, housing bases have never been taxed, and the county government is currently carrying out a supplementary grain tax. However, the official property office recently asked the Ministry of Finance whether the base without grain can be regarded as official property. The Ministry of Finance has issued an instruction that the base without grain should all be regarded as official property. Therefore, the supplementary grain tax has been shelved. The price for the base should be paid to the official property office before the supplementary grain tax can be carried out. The people are overburdened and are strongly opposed to it.</p>

<p>Qin Shifang, the chief of the 10th district of this county, was kidnapped by a group of bandits while returning to Lin by car. The bandits took him and the driver, Deng Jin, to the bandit den in Xiajiaji. Qin was beaten and covered in wounds. They ordered Qin to send a letter to the 10th district office through driver Deng, saying, "Please ask the brigade to postpone the suppression, otherwise, the bandits will cut up Shifang's body and show it to the public." This news has been briefly mentioned in the previous report. After hearing the news, County Magistrate Yang immediately ordered the police captain, Zhu Hua, to find a way to rescue him nearby. He also sent a letter to Battalion Commander Sun for assistance. According to someone from the 10th district, more than 300 bandits entrenched in Xiajiaji heard that the brigade was coming, so they found more than 100 civilian boats, fully loaded with hostages, spoils, and guns, and fled to Xiaogezhuang in Dongjiatan in the 9th district. It is also said that District Chief Qin has been brutally murdered by the bandits, but this has not been confirmed.</p>

<p>Recently, the circulation of red and white pills in Nantong's urban and rural areas has been shocking. The poison pills are considered a necessity for social interaction in various song halls and brothels, and the poison pills are abnormally full. As a result, Zhu Jingfang's Jingxing Opium Public Sales Company, which was established in Tongzhou, was greatly hit and lost more than 3,000 yuan. Zhu has returned to Shanghai, and the company has stopped.</p>

<p>Jin Hua and Jin Yu, brothers from Hanzhuang Township, Lifa District, Rugao, have always been unlawful. Recently, they suddenly conspired to kill their younger brother, Jin Wen, and moved his body to a field in Dai Zhuang Township, intending to defraud money. Later, Ding Zhang Chengru from the village learned of the plan and ordered them to prepare a coffin and bury the body to avoid attention. Now, Wang, the wife of Jin Fu, the deceased's third brother, has reported the matter to the Public Security Sub-Bureau. After receiving the report, the sub-bureau immediately sent a senior police officer to the crime scene, accompanied by the village Ding, to arrest the murderer Dan Jinyu. After a brief interrogation by the sub-bureau, because the case involved murder, they immediately prepared a document to report to the county government and asked them to send someone to investigate.</p>

<p>Participating in the Lushan Conference to Discuss Political Issues, Yu Ming Accompanied Him. Sun Said He Would Return to Shanghai in a Few Days</p>
<p>Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, flew to Xun yesterday morning at 8:10 from Longhua Airport on the China National Aviation Corporation's Jiujiang aircraft in response to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's telegram to attend the Lushan Conference. Ke and Ming were accompanied, and Yang Hu, Director of the Municipal Security Department, Li Zhaohuan, President of Jiaotong University, Wu Jingxiong, Deputy Chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee of the Legislative Yuan, and others went to Longhua to see him off. According to Sun's statement to people before leaving, although the military part of the Lushan Conference has ended, the political part is just beginning to be discussed, so Yu hurried to participate and did not feel it was too late. He said that he would stay in Lushan for about three or four days and then return to Shanghai. Sun's Jiujiang aircraft was scheduled to arrive in Jiujiang at 1:30 PM yesterday. Sun will then transfer from Jiujiang to Lushan to meet Chiang and Wang to finalize the Chahar and various important political issues.</p>

<p>He Said that This Trip Was to Inspect the Local Consular Affairs</p>
<p>There Were No Special Diplomatic Appointments</p>
<p>French Minister to China Wei Lide, together with his secretary Bi Kedu and others, took the Pingpu train south from Beijing on Wednesday and arrived in Beijing the day before yesterday. He then transferred to the Jinghu Railway night express train to Shanghai at 11:00 PM that evening and arrived at the North Station at 8:00 AM yesterday. The French Consul-General in Shanghai, Meili Ai, and others went to the station to welcome him. After getting off the train, he went to the Cathay Hotel to rest. According to the French Consulate, Wei's trip south was to inspect local consular affairs and there were no special diplomatic missions. He planned to stay in Shanghai for a week and then go elsewhere. However, according to other news, the French Minister suddenly went south from Beijing in this hot weather, presumably with an important diplomatic mission.</p>
<h3 id="e110">No More Inspection of Antiquities in the Forbidden City <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The Media will be invited to report the inspection process</p>
<p>The inspection of antiquities stored in the Forbidden City Museum has been going on for three days. The work stopped on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. Yesterday at around 11:00, the Temporary Supervisory Committee held a meeting. The supervisors Chen Rui (Executive Yuan), Huang Penghao (Military Committee), Liu Yunhang (Municipal Council), Zhou Ren (Academia Sinica), Ouyang Shu (Local Court) and others attended to discuss the issue of exposing the fur clothing to the sun. Because the Supervisory Committee is only in a supervisory position, the Forbidden City Museum is responsible for the exposure. At the meeting, Zhou Ren and Zhuang Shangyan, two standing committee members, were directly contacted by Ma Heng, the president of the museum. However, although the price of fur clothing is valuable, it has no cultural value, so it was marked for sale in Beijing. Also, the fur clothing in the Shanghai boxes is only damp, so it does not seem to be a very important issue whether it is exposed to the sun or not. It was immediately decided that the inspection of antiquities was decided to come to an end, and no more inspections will be held in the future. Supervisors Chen Rui and Huang Penghao returned to Beijing yesterday to report everything. The Forbidden City Museum plans to invite news reporters in the near future to report all inspection information in detail so that people in the community can be fully informed of the inspection process.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Yang Dezhao Talks About Guangdong Affairs <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>France's Occupation of Small Islands in Southern Hainan, Guangdong Has Begun Research</p>
<p>Guangdong's Advance is Slow Due to the Suppression of Remnant Bandits</p>
<p>According to the National News Agency, Mr. Yang Dezhao, representative of Chen Jitang of Guangdong Province, arrived in Shanghai the night before yesterday. Yesterday, reporters met with Mr. Yang and asked about the suppression of bandits in Guangdong Province and France's occupation of nine small islands in southern Hainan. According to his answer, before I left Guangdong, I heard that Guangdong had already begun to study the issue of France's occupation of the nine islands, but how to deal with it after the research is unknown. Now, after reading the newspaper, I learned that the central government will send a warship from the Ministry of Navy to investigate. I believe that after the investigation, the reason for this will be clear. As for the military suppression of bandits, Guangdong Province has always had financial difficulties. In addition, overseas Chinese businessmen have been depressed in recent years and have been forced to return to the country, which is increasing. Therefore, it is becoming more and more exhausted. The military is progressing smoothly, but for the fundamental plan of the Guangdong army, for every city it conquers, it must build strong fortifications on one side, and the people's autonomy and transportation construction must be carried out simultaneously. Also, as far as food is concerned, the farmland has long been barren wherever the bandits have set foot, and it is impossible to cultivate it in a short time. Moreover, Guangdong rice is not enough to feed itself. Now, after the disaster caused by bandits, the price of rice has been soaring. All military food is purchased from Nanxiong and Shantou and transported for relief. Although the other Guangdong army has advanced to Ganzhou, there are still scattered bandits in Anyuan and Xunwu. With these various reasons, for the sake of fundamental suppression, Guangdong's advance seems to be a bit slow. Especially the transportation relationship is very large. The highway from Nanxiong to Ganzhou will be completed soon. At the same time, other five or six main lines are also being actively carried out. Mr. Chen Zhenru, I visited Hong Kong twice, but due to time constraints, I did not visit. However, Chen is still in Hong Kong. I will stay in Shanghai for three or four days, and then go to Beijing first, and then go to Lushan to visit Chairman Chiang to report everything.</p>

<p>Based on the Principle of Not Damaging Sovereignty</p>
<p>Both Sides are Exchanging Views</p>
<p>The electricity in the West Shanghai area of this city has always been supplied by the concession power company. The municipal government requested instructions from the central government on the matter, believing that it was related to Chinese sovereignty, so that it could carry out negotiations. The central government has determined 18 principles and ordered the municipal government to be informed. The municipal government immediately transferred the order to the municipal public utilities bureau to negotiate with the concession power company. A reporter from the Central News Agency asked Secretary-General Yu of the municipal government about the progress of the negotiations. According to him, the municipal government has ordered the municipal public utilities bureau to negotiate with the concession power company based on the central government's established guidelines. The principle is not to damage our country's sovereignty, but the concession power company has been operating the electricity business in West Shanghai for several years, so it is difficult to ask for any results at once. Currently, both sides are exchanging views.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Two Groups Welcome Aviators Chen Wenlin and Pan Dingxin <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Report on the Flight from England Back to China</p>
<p>Aviator Chen Wenlin and aircraft manufacturer Pan Dingxin recently came to Shanghai from Xiamen on a Navy-built aircraft. The Deutera Verein and Tongji Alumni Association held a banquet to welcome Chen and Pan at the Fuxin Restaurant last night, as Chen and Pan had both studied in Germany. About fifty or sixty people attended. Huang Boqiao presided over the meeting, and Dr. You Pengxi reported on Chen and Pan's study of aircraft manufacturing in Germany. Then, Chen Wenlin was invited to speak about the flight from London back to China in 1928. Chen reported that when he flew back to China in 1928, he went through 14 countries and 34 stations, spending four to five hours at each station. He went through many dangers on the way. The first time he flew over the London Strait, the aircraft parts broke down and he returned to England for repairs. The second time, he was damaged in the desert in Persia and telegraphed to England to purchase aircraft parts. It took three weeks to get there, and the drinks were all transported from India. The food and lodging were unbearable. The third time, near Calcutta, he had to land in the Sha River due to oil leakage, and the fuselage overturned. He repaired it for many days. The fourth time, he was forced to land in Annam for some reason. After that, he flew safely to Xiamen. He originally intended to continue flying to Shanghai and Nanjing, but at that time, China's aviation was still very young. It took eight hours to fly from Xiamen to Shanghai, and the aircraft he was on could only hold seven hours of fuel, and there was no suitable airport along the way, so he could not continue flying. After I received the order from the Ministry of Navy to establish the Aviation Office in Xiamen, I worked hard to train flight and aircraft manufacturing talents. Fortunately, with the help of Mr. Pan Dingxin, I finally got my wish. The Jiangque aircraft, which I drove this time, except for the engine, is made of domestic products as much as possible and made by Chinese workers. However, I still feel that there are too few domestic products, and many parts have to be made with foreign products.</p>
<h3 id="e114">The Aircraft Association Notifies All Factories to Refuse to Accept English Letters from the Gongbu Bureau <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Should be translated into Chinese and sent together to avoid misunderstandings</p>
<p>And pointed out two errors of the bureau</p>
<p>Regarding the Gongbu Bureau's warning to all factories, the Aircraft Association protested again yesterday and notified all members to refuse to accept foreign language letters from the Gongbu Bureau in the future. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e115">Public Concession Bureau's Error <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>After repeated warnings from the authorities of both the Public Concession and the French Concession to more than ten domestic goods factories, including Yi Yuan, Yi Sheng, Meiya, and China, each factory, fearing forced closure, has taken measures to improve automatically. The Machine Union believes that there are two errors in the warning letter from the Public Concession Bureau to the Yi Sheng Factory: (1) The chemical refining and grinding of rubber is essentially one type of work, but after investigation by the bureau members, the warning letter from the Public Concession Bureau actually separates them into two; (2) The shoe-hanging carts and freight carts in the rubber factory are completely different in nature. The pushing of shoe-hanging carts must not be forceful, as any force will damage the luster of the galoshes. However, after investigation by the bureau members, the warning letter from the Public Concession Bureau stated that efforts should be made to avoid working with iron tools on iron products or steel tools on steel products, and that the wheels of iron freight carts running on iron rails should not be made of iron or steel edges. Therefore, Chief Executive Cheng Shouchong, together with Yi Sheng Factory Director and Manager Tu Yanchen, questioned the Public Concession Bureau yesterday morning, and were received by He De Kui, who was in charge. He had no response to these two points and could only admit the errors.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Refusing to Accept English Letters <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Machine Union issued a notice to its members, stating: "Respectfully, since the Western taxpayers' association in the Public Concession unilaterally amended Article 34 of the Yangjingbang Regulations, forcing factories to obtain licenses from the Public Concession Bureau, hoping to seize the right to inspect Chinese factories, this association has repeatedly expressed its opposition. Unexpectedly, this time, the Public Concession Bureau, using Article 30 of the Yangjingbang Regulations as an excuse to 'prevent public danger,' ordered factories in the concession to stop work and relocate, which directly affects the economy and development of factories and the livelihoods of laborers, and indirectly affects the peace and order of society. This association has convened a temporary meeting to jointly devise countermeasures, and has submitted requests to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the municipal government and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for instructions, and requested that protests be lodged. At the same time, fearing that factories in the concession would obtain licenses from the Public Concession Bureau and cede sovereignty, we published declarations in the newspapers and, for the sake of public safety, assisted the Public Concession Bureau in providing as much guidance as possible on factory improvements to eliminate hidden dangers and avoid disputes, all of which are on record. Recently, when factories received warnings from the Public Concession Bureau and reported to the association, the association has always been running around and providing guidance to avoid losses from suspension of work and relocation. As a result, it was discovered that the Public Concession Bureau members' investigations of factories were entirely based on ideal assumptions and not based on facts at all. The errors are recorded below (two points see above). From these two points, it can be seen that the Public Concession Bureau did not seek specialized personnel for its investigations and did not take matters seriously. Even if the Westerners involved in the investigation, no matter how knowledgeable or experienced, could quickly understand the content, order, and working conditions of a certain industry in the shortest period of time, it is not only impossible in reason, but also not allowed by facts. Moreover, relying solely on the Westerner's own assumptions, the nitpicking investigations have been clearly demonstrated by the association's participation. However, the Public Concession Bureau used this as a basis to warn factories. Factories that are not proficient in English must hire someone to translate, and the translator's interpretation is then turned into Chinese, which is even further from the facts. How can they avoid wrongful suspension of work and wrongful relocation? This matter concerns the vital interests of factories, and one mistake cannot be allowed to be repeated. Therefore, a special letter is issued to all domestic goods factories: in the future, if you receive English letters from the Public Concession Bureau, you should return them immediately and ask them to translate them into Chinese before sending them back together with the original English letter, so that you can accept them and avoid errors. Please comply accordingly."</p>
<p>Measures to defend against humiliation. It is hoped that the people of the country will pay special attention to talents in aviation and aircraft manufacturing. It is reported that Chen and Pan plan to continue flying to Beiping after the engine of the Wang Que aircraft is modified, and then from Beiping to Guangxi to complete their flight plan.</p>

<p>Relief funds are exhausted and we cannot provide assistance</p>
<p>The Northeastern Refugee Relief Committee of this city received a letter from Kong Xianrong, deputy commander of Wang Delin's army, stating that the families of his troops in Shanghai were having difficulty making a living and requesting relief. The association now replied to Kong yesterday, stating that its relief funds were exhausted and it was unable to provide assistance: "Respectfully, we received your letter and the attached list. We have heard everything. This time, the families of your generals, having suffered hardship in the Northeast, arrived in Shanghai after many detours. This association has set up a place to receive them, hoping to fulfill the mission of relieving our compatriots in the Northeast. However, we are honored with excessive praise, which we dare not accept. Now, your generals are either staying at the front or guarding new provinces, loyally defending the country, which we deeply admire. We are requested to continue to maintain support. This association is willing to make every effort to prevent the decline of our initial efforts. However, at present, relief funds are nearing exhaustion, and fundraising is becoming increasingly difficult. Moreover, this association is a temporary organization, and its duration is uncertain. The families of your generals staying in Shanghai should still be asked to devise a thorough and comprehensive plan for their future arrangements as soon as possible. We have stated our case frankly, and hope you will understand."</p>

<p>Coal and raw materials for steelmaking to be taken from Dangtu</p>
<p>Contract awaits Song's return to the country for signing</p>
<p>Xinxin News Agency reports: The Ministry of Industry and Commerce's plan to establish a copper and iron plant has been discussed with the German company GHH for some time. A consensus has been reached on the terms of cooperation, and only the formal signing of the contract remains. The plant site has been decided to be in Ma'anshan, because there are extremely rich iron ore deposits there, and it is close to Dangtu, which is rich in coal resources. Coal and raw materials for steelmaking can all be obtained from there. Technicians are currently being dispatched to Ma'anshan and Dangtu to measure the reserves of coal and iron, as well as their depth. The date of formal signing will depend on the return of Finance Minister Song Ziwen to the country due to economic reasons.</p>

<p>The Supervisory Committee of the Northeastern Volunteer Army Support Association held its fourth meeting at the Hong Kong Road Bankers' Association at 12:00 noon yesterday. Supervisors Pan Xulun, Bei Zuyi, Chen Peide, Wang Zhisheng, and Lu Jiading attended. Standing Director Chu Fucheng and Custodian Committee Chairman Lin Kanghou were also present. Pan Xulun was publicly elected as chairman. After reporting the purpose of the meeting, the following cases were discussed: Reporting matters: (1) The chairman reported the amount of donations received and paid and the distribution of relief from the establishment in May last year to the end of June this year. Matters for discussion: (2) The detailed accounts of the funds raised from the drama performance held by the Standing Committee last year have now been submitted and requested for review. It was resolved to review them and notify the Standing Committee to attach the accounts to the second issue of the Creditworthiness Record for public announcement. (3) There are still more than 2,000 unsold items from the previous art exhibition, which have been received by the Standing Committee. How should they be stored? It was resolved to send a letter to the Custodian and Standing Committees, asking them to transfer the items to the Custodian Committee for safekeeping. (4) Recently, there have been great doubts in society regarding donations to Ma Zhanshan. This association is also one of the donation agencies. Should a statement be made regarding the amount of donations to Ma? It was resolved that there was no need to make a separate statement, but the donation accounts for the receipts and expenditures before the end of June this year should be closed as soon as possible, audited, and published, and the Creditworthiness Record should be printed and distributed to all sectors. (5) Supervisor Pan Xulun proposed on an ad hoc basis that the donations received by the association now are relatively small, and the association's expenses should be saved. It was resolved to send a letter to the Standing Committee asking them to schedule a joint meeting of the Standing, Custodian, and Supervisory Committees to discuss whether the association should temporarily end or reduce its scope. (6) Supervisor Bei Zuyi proposed on an ad hoc basis that the association should announce to donors that they should pay attention to whether their names and the amount of their donations are recorded in the Creditworthiness Record. If their donation is not listed, please bring the receipt to the Supervisory Committee for inquiry in order to investigate. It was resolved to pass the proposal. (7) Supervisor Chen Peide proposed on an ad hoc basis that the previous joint meeting had proposed that all donations received by the association that were handed over to groups or individuals to be forwarded to the Northeastern Anti-Japanese generals should have their handwritten receipts submitted to the association for review and filing, which had already been resolved to be followed. However, it has not yet been implemented. Should the association send another letter to the Standing Committee to follow up? It was resolved to send a letter to the Standing Committee, asking them to handle the matter in accordance with the resolution within the scope possible. The meeting adjourned after the discussions.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Sino-Russian-German Air Transport Joint Operation Issue <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Li Jingcong will return to Shanghai for detailed discussion</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Beijing: The trial flight between Dihua and Tacheng was successful, and the Sino-Russian-German joint air transport can be implemented on August 1. The reporter specially visited the Hangya Aviation Company to inquire. According to Secretary Zhenhu Tan, the head of the airline group, Walter, went to the stations in Xinjiang last week to discuss the matter, and the results were satisfactory. The radio station can be installed immediately, but it must wait until Manager Li returns before it can be decided. It will also take time to install the radio station, so the joint operation still needs to wait. The details of Mr. Cha's conversation are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e121">Eurasian Joint Transport <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Cha said that the main task of the company is to connect the direct transportation between Europe and Asia. Initially, there was a plan for direct air transport from Shanghai to Berlin, but due to the initial establishment of the company, the strength was insufficient, and the situation in Xinjiang was constantly changing, and various obstacles were unavoidable. Therefore, joint transport was carried out first. The German shareholder Lufthansa contacted the Russian side and obtained their consent. It was expected to be implemented in the spring of this year, but the matter was delayed due to sudden changes in Xinjiang. Now that the government has sent personnel to mediate, it is gradually becoming stable. Therefore, the head of the airline group of the company, the German Walter, took the plane west last Wednesday, stayed in Hami for an hour, and continued west. He stopped in Dihua for a day, and then went to Tacheng and other places in Xinjiang. The opinions on politics may not be completely consistent, but they all expressed their willingness to sincerely maintain the transportation business. Therefore, Mr. Hua's trip received a warm reception from the local authorities and achieved satisfactory results. Local telegrams had previously been prohibited from being set up by the provincial government, so navigation was very difficult. Now, the authorities have also approved the construction of the radio station after receiving the order.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Implementation Still Needs to Wait <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Cha continued, "The radio stations in various places have not yet been built, and the situation in Xinjiang has not yet been fully stabilized. It is necessary to consider whether there will be any more incidents in the future. After the joint operation is implemented, mail between the two continents will be delivered on schedule through this fastest route. If an incident occurs in Xinjiang, transportation will be hindered, and the company's international reputation will inevitably be damaged. Therefore, there are no difficulties in terms of geography and weather for the implementation of this route. The reason for careful consideration is to avoid the impact of politics. Manager Li returned to Beijing last week to visit relatives, and is scheduled to come to Shanghai tomorrow on a China National Aviation Corporation flight from Beijing to Shanghai to discuss this matter in detail."</p>

<p>The Lanzhou-Qinghai branch line is not long and is easy to implement. However, there is no business in the area, only to connect the transportation in the interior. Since the line has no income, it requires local assistance. The Qinghai Provincial Government was previously informed and approved, but it was only a proposal. Li had a plan to fly to Qinghai recently to discuss the matter in person, but he was unable to do so due to illness. He will probably go after returning to Shanghai.</p>

<p>The company's plan for this year is to change the Ping-Luo line to pass through Taiyuan in Shanxi to Xi'an. The Guangdong-Hankou line will also be extended through Xiangyang to Xi'an, both of which will meet with the Northwest line. The two lines have been decided and will be completed this year. However, since the budget has not yet been determined and the approval of the Ministry of Communications is required, planning has not yet begun. However, it is hoped that it will be completed this year.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Soviet Russian Commercial Commissioner Gao Maofu Comes to China to Investigate Commerce <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Plans to establish a Sino-Russian joint venture company in Tianjin</p>
<p>Capital set at eight million to fifteen million</p>
<p>Since the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, Russian goods have been selling well, while China's exports are the opposite. The biggest reason is that Russia's trade system is state-owned, while China's is still free trade. In order to control trade with Russia, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has drafted a detailed plan to establish a trade bureau, which has been approved by the Central Political Council and handed over to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for detailed consultation. At the same time, it is also planned to organize a Soviet Russian industrial inspection team with officials and merchants to learn from. However, the plan was delayed due to the Soviet Union's sale of the Middle East Railway. According to the International Trade Bureau, the Soviet Russian authorities have sent Commercial Commissioner Gao Maofu to China to develop the Russian goods market in China. He will go to Tianjin, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and other places to conduct on-the-spot investigations of China's commercial conditions. Xinxin News Agency reporters learned from another source that the task of Soviet Russian Commercial Commissioner Gao Maofu's visit to China, in addition to investigating the current state of commerce in China, is to establish a Sino-Russian commercial and civilian joint venture company in Tianjin with a capital of eight million to fifteen million, specializing in the export and import trade between China and Russia. It is also reported that the industrial authorities have paid attention to the joint venture company before the establishment of the bureau.</p>

<h3 id="e131">All Zhejiang Public Association Appeals for the People of Linhai County <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Forced to subscribe to shares for the Xintian-Linhai Highway</p>
<p>The All Zhejiang Public Association submitted a document to the government, stating that Yao Yanwen, the magistrate of Linhai County, was illegally forcing people to subscribe to road shares, enriching himself and abusing the people, in order to raise funds for the construction of the Xintian-Linhai Highway. It is requested that he be dismissed from office and investigated, and that another method of raising funds be established to rebuild the road. The construction of highways in various counties is an implementation of developing transportation. If any people are able to do so within their financial means, they should contribute to help achieve it. The government offices in charge of road administration should also carefully plan the beginning, assess whether the construction of the road meets the local needs within the scope of the people's ability, and whether it is conducive to transportation and transportation, as well as the urgency, importance, difficulty, and ease of the project, with a comprehensive plan and accurate estimate. They should use peaceful and universal methods to persuade people to participate in the purchase of shares, and should not add any pressure, so that everyone will be suspicious, which will hinder the progress of road construction. However, this association has repeatedly received letters from Wang Shixian, Wang Shijin, Yang Dezhan, Zhang Yinshi, Wang Qichuan, Hu Heshang, Li Rongzhao, Ma Bingwen, Hu Shizhong, and others in Linhai, stating that Yao Yanwen, the magistrate of Linhai County, was raising funds for the construction of the Xintian-Linhai Highway. The method of raising funds was to divide the shares into two types, A and B. Type A was 10 yuan, and type B was 5 yuan. Those with more than five mu of real estate were assigned type B shares, and those with more than ten mu were assigned type A shares, and the rest were assigned in progressive amounts. The notice of collection of funds stated that if anyone refused to subscribe and pay, soldiers would be sent to arrest them and force them to pay, and they would also be charged for the expenses of the soldiers and officials. Not only were taxes levied according to the number of mu, but they were also robbed with military force, illegally arrested and detained, and additional supplies were greedily demanded. Their illegal abuse of the people was outrageous. As for Hu Heshang's letter, in addition to this method, those with only two or three mu of land were also required to pay 5 yuan or 10 yuan, without giving receipts. The civilian, who had no land, was assigned 15 yuan in shares, which was later reduced by 5 yuan. Because he refused, four members of the security regiment sent by the district arrested the civilian, tortured and looted him, and put him in shackles. Because his son went to the political and legal authorities to sue, his son A Zhao was also arrested and subjected to inhumane torture. His hands were tied behind his back and exposed to the scorching sun on a stone slab for an hour. Yang Dekan's letter stated that he was forced to subscribe to five shares of the Xintian-Linhai road shares by Wang Dingrui, the district chief of the district, with a deadline of three days. One day, he received a letter on the afternoon of the third day, and more than ten members of the security regiment came to force him to pay. They first demanded 4 yuan and 6 jiao for the expenses of the security personnel, and then dragged him to the security regiment, where he was shackled with wooden shackles and tied to a pillar. Later, he pawned three mu of land and exchanged the proceeds for a receipt of 25 yuan. Another 2 yuan was used for expenses before he was released. Their barbarity and cruelty were something that officials in the era of autocratic warlords dared not do, but they were seen under the party rule of Qingbai. How can we not be indignant? This case was approved by the Zhejiang Provincial Government on July 6 this year. The Linhai farmers, Yang Dezhan, and others, petitioned for relief from the forced subscription of funds for the Xintian-Linhai road. The approval stated that the case had been previously submitted by Li Rongzhao, Yu Wenguang, and Li Ding of the county, and the Ministry of Finance and Construction had been ordered to order the county magistrate to thoroughly investigate and report, and to quickly submit the method of raising funds for review. After the report was submitted to the government, it was ordered to wait for the county government to submit the report to the Ministry before reviewing it and reporting it. This approval shows that the method of raising funds has not yet been submitted for approval. The county magistrate is using the beautiful name of construction to carry out the abusive policies of extortion, disregarding the national law and ignoring the people's wishes. His boldness and recklessness are shocking. This association is saddened by the decline of official morality and the helplessness of the people. We do not hesitate to speak out and present this case on behalf of the people. We have attached a copy of the Linhai Fundraising Method for the Xintian-Linhai Highway and a genuine copy of the collection notice with the official seal. In addition to submitting separate petitions, we respectfully request the President to order the Executive Yuan to transfer the case to the Zhejiang Provincial Government, allowing (the Provincial Government to quickly) dismiss and investigate County Magistrate Yao Yanwen, as well as Wang Dingrui and others who assisted him in his abuse of power. At the same time, the method of raising funds that has not been approved should be revoked, and personnel should be sent to investigate the construction process of the highway and raise funds separately to rebuild the road, so as to improve road administration and relieve the people's difficulties. We cannot help but appeal and hope. Respectfully presented to National Government Chairman Lin, Executive Yuan President Wang, Zhejiang Provincial Government Chairman Lu, and Supervisory Yuan President Yu, by the chairman of the Shanghai All Zhejiang Public Association, Director Chu Fucheng.</p>

<p>Group meetings will continue today</p>
<p>The Shanghai Joint Office of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fish Industry Association held a plenary meeting of representatives at the association's headquarters on Sichuan Road at 2:00 pm yesterday to discuss the method of dealing with the fishery construction fee that cannot be collected by the fish market or contracted for the donation amount, and the important issue of organizing the Joint Association of Jiangsu-Zhejiang Sea Fish Industry Associations. Representatives from various places came to Shanghai to attend the meeting enthusiastically. The details of the meeting are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e134">Attending Representatives <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>

<h3 id="e135">Discussion of Various Cases <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>First, the Chairman reported on the situation of the Fisheries Construction Fee dispute and the process of mediation. Then, the discussion began. (1) Regarding the proposal to initiate the organization of the Joint Association of Zhejiang Seafood, Fresh and Salted Fish Industries, it is necessary to apply to the Party and government organs for a license. (Explanation) Since the eastward spread of European trends and the beginning of commercial warfare, the survival of the fittest has become a universal principle of natural selection. Chinese commerce has historically lacked organization and research, let alone our industry. Once it suffers even a slight foreign insult, it is caught completely unprepared. If we do not strengthen our organization and thoroughly explore matters, how can we stand firm in the world? It was decided that (A) applications should be submitted to the Party and government organs for the issuance of licenses; before obtaining a license, an initiators' meeting should be organized first; (B) representatives of local industry associations can attend as initiators; (C) Fang Wenying, Hu Diansun, Mao Anqing, Ge Weian, Fang Youdu, Zhang Zhisheng, Le Qidong, and seven others were elected as representatives responsible internally and externally; (D) Hu Diansun was mutually elected as the chief representative. (2) Regarding the eight opinions previously proposed, a request was made to reconsider the case. It was decided to amend and pass them. (The original text has been published in previous reports, so it is omitted here.) (3) Regarding the Fisheries Construction Fee, which has not yet been resolved, what should be done? (Explanation) Although this case has been mediated three times by three mediators, the focus remains on treating fishing and fish as one. Fishing is fishing, and the Ministry of Industry has explained this. Moreover, the Fisheries Law stipulates in its very first article that fishing includes both harvesting and aquaculture. Therefore, this construction fee should clearly be collected from those engaged in harvesting and aquaculture. Our industry deals in fresh, dried, and salted seafood, which is nothing more than fishmongering and buying and selling between merchants. It is by no means fishing by fishermen. It is a direct transaction between the fishing merchant and the industry. How can we collect on their behalf? We have earnestly stated our case to the authorities, but they have not understood. It was decided that (A) if the government authorities exert too much pressure, then during the critical period, all localities should uniformly adopt emergency and effective response measures (secret); (B) when necessary, representatives should be sent to Beijing to petition. It was decided that the petition representatives would be the previously elected responsible representatives; (C) regarding the measures in item A, each representative should discuss them further with their respective associations and submit their written opinions by August 10th for comprehensive review and handling. (4) It was decided that a small group meeting would be held at 4:00 PM on the 30th (today). The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM after the discussions.</p>

<p>Representative Meng Lujiu, who previously joined this office and consistently held its positions, suddenly telegraphed the office a few days ago, stating that, regarding the case of collecting the Fisheries Construction Fee, after three mediations by Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Du Yuesheng, and Yu Zuoting, our association has declared its withdrawal. Hereafter, our association will not be involved in any of your office's affairs. This is telegraphed for your information.

<h3 id="e137">All Workers of the Shanghai Power Company Petitioned the City Party Headquarters Yesterday <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Over 1,600 Workers Braved the Heat and Walked to Request Resumption of Work and Improved Treatment</p>
<p>According to the Guomin News Agency, the Shanghai Power Company dismissed Ni Wenfu, Pan Genlin, Chen Baogen, and Zhang Caisheng, directors and staff respectively, of the Fourth District (Shanghai) Water and Electricity Industry Workers' Union. It also refused to accept improved treatment conditions, causing resentment among all workers, which led to a labor strike. For a month now, despite repeated mediation by Party and government organs and Chinese directors such as Yuan Ludeng of the Municipal Council, no resolution has been reached. Over 1,600 workers from the company sent representatives to the City Party Headquarters yesterday afternoon, holding a petition requesting assistance in resuming work and improving treatment conditions. They also distributed a declaration. Details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Workers Departed. Over 1,600 workers from the company's new factory in Yangshupu, Hongkou, and the old factory on Fielun Road, due to the Public Concession authorities preventing gatherings, departed from the two locations in succession yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM and walked to Xinbeimen, where they gathered, organized, and divided into five teams: Negotiation, Rescue, Discipline, Transportation, and General Command. They were led by a white cloth banner reading "Petitioning Group of Shanghai Power Company Workers." Each worker wore a white cloth armband. They walked along Minguo Road to the City Party Headquarters to petition. The District Head of the Second District received the information and dispatched patrol officer Long Daozhen, police chief Rao Zengcheng, and 24 police officers, along with detectives Wang Shaohua and Wang Yushan from the Garrison Headquarters Investigation Team, to maintain order.</p>
<p>Request for Assistance. The workers stood respectfully in front of the City Party Headquarters, sweating profusely under the scorching sun. They elected Dai Rensi, Lou Yongquan, Jiang Zhongming, Bao Defu, and Chen Miaosheng as representatives. Led by Ni Wenfu, the executive director of the union, they entered the headquarters. Dai Youheng, a staff member of the Civil Affairs Section of the City Party Headquarters, received them. The representatives first reported the circumstances of the labor strike and requested assistance in restoring work and improving treatment conditions. They raised four points regarding the company: (1) Reinstate Ni Wenfu and the other three; (2) The company must pay workers a 5% pension and an additional month's salary as a year-end bonus each year; (3) Those who die on duty should receive a subsidy of 2,000 yuan as compensation; (4) The company shall not dismiss workers without cause in the future; if the company is unable to maintain employment and lays off workers, it must pay three months' severance pay, etc. They also submitted a petition and a declaration. Dai gave some encouragement and expressed his willingness to provide as much assistance as possible and engage in appropriate negotiations with the company. The representatives were satisfied. They dispersed around 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>Petition: Presented to the Shanghai Power Company for Unjustly Dismissing Council Members of the Association and Refusing to Accept Improved Treatment Conditions. We Earnestly Request Your Powerful Assistance. It is Noted That the Shanghai Power Company Has Unjustly Dismissed Association Council Members Ni Wenfu, Pan Genlin, Chen Baogen, and Staff Member Zhang Caisheng, Causing Public Outrage Among All Workers. The Labor Strike Has Been Ongoing for Nearly a Month. The Detailed Circumstances Have Already Been Reported to Your Headquarters. Your Headquarters and Mr. Yuan Ludeng, the Chinese Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Have Taken Turns to Mediate, but the Company Has Been Cunning and Refused to Accept the Conditions for Reinstatement and Improved Treatment, Resulting in No Resolution. All the Workers of the Association Are Under the Heavy Oppression of Imperialist Capitalists, and We Can No Longer Endure It. We Have No Choice but to Come to Your Headquarters to Petition. We Urgently Request Your Headquarters to Consider the Suffering of the Workers and Quickly Provide Powerful Assistance, Ordering the Shanghai Power Company to Immediately Accept the Workers' Conditions and Reinstate Ni Wenfu, Pan Genlin, Chen Baogen, Zhang Caisheng, Etc. As Soon as Possible to Maintain Labor Movement and End the Dispute. We Cannot Express Our Impatience. Respectfully Submitted (omitted below).</p>
<p>Workers' Declaration: We, the More Than 2,000 Workers of the Power Company, Live Like Beasts of Burden Under Imperialist Capitalists. We Work Hard All Day Long, Creating Huge Enterprises for the Imperialist Capitalists and Creating All Kinds of Happiness for Society. Now the Imperialist Capitalists Have Squeezed Our Sweat and Blood Dry, Completely Abandoning Our Credit and Labor That Created Great Enterprises for the Capitalists. Taking Advantage of the Current Unemployment Craze, They Pushed Our Fellow Workers Batch After Batch into the Unemployment Line, Causing Them to Suffer Hunger and Cold. They Dismissed Highly Paid Senior Workers and Replaced Them with Low-Wage Workers. They Took Advantage of Opportunities to Embezzle the Workers' Rightful Pensions. If This Continues, the Future of Our More Than 2,000 Fellow Workers Will Be Hopeless. Therefore, There Are Four Items of Improved Treatment Measures, Requesting Capital to Accept and Implement. After Repeated Negotiations, the Capital Party's Attitude Is Firm and Deliberately Suppressive. They Also Dismissed Negotiation Representatives. After Mediation by Party and Government Organs, They Still Refused to Accept Any. After Considering All of Our Members' Grievances, We Wanted to Do Something. We Repeatedly Considered That Electricity Is a Public Utility and Did Not Want to Act Rashly. Therefore, We Rushed to Various Circles to Appeal and Again Petitioned the Party and Government Organs to Urge the Capital Party to Have a Final Awakening. If They Still Put Their Private Interests First and Disregard Justice, They Will Inevitably Go to Extremes. Then All the Responsibilities Should Be Fully Borne by the Capital Party of the Power Company. We Hope That All Circles Will Uphold Justice and Provide Sympathetic Assistance. This Declaration.</p>

<h3 id="e139">Pirates Attack and Assault Yangtze River Steamer near Matouzhen <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Jiang'an Steamer Hit by Bullets, Passengers Injured</p>
<p>Shipping Industry Asks for Warships to Suppress Pirates</p>
<p>In recent years, bandits in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River have gradually become less visible, and steamers have sailed more safely. However, above Hankou, escorts are still needed to protect the waterways. Unexpectedly, recently, a large number of bandits emerged near Wuxue, across the river, to attack steamers in an attempt to plunder them. This time, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiang'an steamer was attacked, resulting in injuries to passengers and bullet damage to the ship's hull. The details are being investigated and reported as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e140">Jiang'an Sailing Downstream to Shanghai <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Yangtze River steamer Jiang'an is one of the largest in the company's fleet of Yangtze River steamers. This time, on the 26th of this month, it sailed downstream from Hankou, carrying a large number of goods and passengers, heading back to Shanghai. Due to the high water level of the river, it followed the order of the Jianghai Customs and switched to slow speed, as fast speed might erode the riverbank and cause damage. On the morning of the 27th, the ship sailed below Huangzhou, approaching Wuxue, when it suddenly encountered a large number of bandits attempting to plunder the ship. The bandits opened fire on the Jiang'an steamer, endangering passengers.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Upper Reaches Bandits Plan to Plunder <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>When the Jiang'an steamer arrived at Wuxue, it was 6:25 AM on the 27th. At this time, it was sailing downstream at slow speed, with the ship sailing in the center of the river. Suddenly, the sound of gunfire was heard from across the river from Wuxue. This area had been peaceful for a long time. Upon hearing this alarm, the crew quickly observed the opposite bank of Wuxue and saw a large number of bandits, about three hundred and several dozen, seemingly coming from Matouzhen. They separated on the riverbank and opened fire on the Jiang'an steamer, intending to force the Jiang'an to stop. The passengers on the ship panicked as the bandits tried to board and plunder the ship. The captain immediately ordered the ship to sail closer to the Wuxue side to avoid the bullets and sped up towards Jiujiang.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Passenger Injury Situation <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>These bandits were well-equipped with firearms, but their clothing and attire were entirely like poor farmers, some wearing blue cloth shirts and trousers, some barefoot. The bandit group also had a red flag. Fortunately, there were no small boats on the river, so the bandits could only chase the Jiang'an steamer along the riverbank. It was found that this place is in Ruichang County, Jiangxi Province, and the opposite bank belongs to Hubei Province. At the time, the Jiang'an steamer was fortunate to evade the attack, so it did not suffer serious damage. However, when the bandits fired bullets indiscriminately, one third-class passenger was shot in the head. Fortunately, the bullet only grazed his head, and his life was not in danger. The other passengers were ordered by the captain to lie on the ship's deck, so although the windows of the dining room were hit by stray bullets, the passengers were not harmed. The injured passenger has arrived in Shanghai and is receiving medical treatment on his own.</p>

<p>After being hit by bullets, the Jiang'an steamer sailed closer to the Wuxue bank, out of reach of the bandits' bullets, and arrived safely in Jiujiang. According to Jiang'an, when it departed from Hankou this time, there were several important military officers traveling in the dining room. After encountering the bandits, they promised to report to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Ganzhou and dispatch troops to suppress the bandits as soon as possible to ensure the safety of the waterways. Yesterday, the Jiang'an steamer arrived in Shanghai, and the captain reported to the head office about the bandit encounter near Matouzhen and the injury to passengers. He also requested that someone be sent to inspect the bullet damage on the ship and repair it immediately. At the same time, he requested that the head office telegraph the Navy Department to quickly send warships to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River to suppress the bandits near Matouzhen across from Wuxue, in order to ensure the safety of passengers and ships.</p>

<p>Accuser Made Untrue and Incomplete Statements; Lin Has Been Returned to the First Special Court</p>
<p>Lin Ziruan, a native of Hubei, was accused by military police officer Zhang Zhiyou to the Municipal Government of plotting to assassinate Finance Minister Song Ziwen in Hong Kong. The Municipal Government ordered the Municipal Police Bureau to cooperate with the Public Concession Police to send detectives to Lin's residence on Dongyouheng Road and detain Lin for delivery to the First Special District Local Court. The court ruled that he should be handed over to the Municipal Police Bureau for investigation and returned within three days. Later, the police expressed dissatisfaction with the Police Bureau for failing to return Lin as scheduled and were preparing to request the court to negotiate with the Police Bureau. However, the bureau sent Lin Ziruan to the Special Court yesterday morning, and the bureau's legal advisor, lawyer Zhan Jifeng, went to court to explain the details. He stated that after the Police Bureau took Lin Ziruan, a suspect in the assassination attempt of Minister Song, from the court, it immediately began an investigation. Due to the time required to search for evidence and summon witnesses, the interrogation was only completed yesterday. Now he is being returned with the case file. The Police Bureau's investigation of the defendant revealed that the accuser, Zhang Zhiyou, had made untrue and incomplete statements. It should be requested that the court continue the trial. If the court finds that the accuser has indeed made false accusations, it is hoped that the court will punish the accuser for false accusations according to the law, in order to avoid wrongly convicting or letting off the guilty. The lawyer also stated that the facts have now proven that the Public Se</p>
<h3 id="e148">Smuggling Case at the Customs House Has Been Sent to the Local Court for Investigation <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Seven More Accomplices Recently Arrested</p>
<p>Many Individuals Have Accumulated Great Wealth Through Smuggling</p>
<p>Many Customs Brokers Are Involved in the Conspiracy</p>
<p>The large-scale smuggling case involving clerks and others at the Jianghai Customs House has been reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that the case is currently being investigated by the Western Detective Chief Pontius, Deputy Detective McKeough, and Chinese Detectives Cheng Yongnian, Sun Fubi, Wang Haiquan, Shen Changshan, Wang Songsheng, Hu Changqing, Gu Wenkui, and others, working together. The investigation has been completed, and the entire case has been sent to the Local Court for investigation. The course of events is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e149">Significant Loss of National Revenue <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>For the past three years, a portion of all import taxes reported to the Jianghai Customs House has been subject to tax evasion and smuggling, resulting in incalculable losses to customs revenue. However, no concrete evidence could be found for prosecution. Therefore, the Customs Anti-Smuggling Section of the Customs Department ordered the Customs Water Police to investigate.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Distribution of Smuggling Proceeds <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>After receiving the order, the Water Police Chief assigned the above detectives to investigate separately. On the 20th of this month, reliable information was obtained stating that a fictitious office was set up inside the United Company at Room 208, 3rd Floor, No. 3 Hankou Road, with a small secret room. It had no legitimate business and was connected to Customs clerks who would stamp forged seals on the green and white customs declarations for large import taxes and secretly take them to the United Company. The forged declarations were stamped with forged seals by Customs clerks to pass them through at a lower price. At the same time, they solicited orders from foreign companies, and customs brokers colluded to commit fraud. It was also found that the manager was Shao Pengfei and the assistant manager was Su Kunnian. The smuggling proceeds were divided into ten shares, with the clerks receiving 35%, the customs brokers 40%, and the company 25%.</p>
<h3 id="e151">All Necessary Documents Available <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>After the investigation was clear, because the location was in the Public Concession, a request was made to the court to issue a search warrant. The Central Police Station on Sima Road dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to the United Company and searched. A small leather suitcase was found, containing 61 forged seals and genuine and forged green and white declarations (about three or four months' worth, previous ones had been destroyed). It was also found that the genuine declaration for nine automobiles reported on the 18th of this month by De Feng Foreign Company on Beijing Road had been removed and replaced with a forged one. The above seals covered all procedures for declaring imported goods, paying taxes, and issuing bills of lading from within the Customs House. Su Kunnian and six others present were arrested.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Seven More Individuals Subsequently Arrested <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>On the same day, it was also discovered that Han Jincai, formerly a clerk residing at No. 28, Lane 810, Xihua Road, had retired because he had accumulated a great deal of profit. He took a concubine and lived a leisurely life. Detectives rushed to the scene. Han was still bathing and having his back scrubbed by his concubine when he was taken away. This greatly spoiled the scene. As a result of this investigation, six more clerks were arrested: Shi Cunjiao, Wu Yueren, Wei Anxiang, Zhang Qiutao, Chen Zhongshan, and Shen Guozhang. It is rumored that there are many others involved in the smuggling at the Customs House, and many have fled after hearing the news.</p>

<p>It was also discovered that customs brokers from the following foreign companies colluded to commit fraud: Ruifeng Foreign Company on Beijing Road, Meizuishi Foreign Company at No. 19 Jiujiang Road, Kaili Foreign Company at No. 17 Bowuyuan Road, Deji Foreign Company at No. 12 Bund, Yuxingxiang Company at No. 74 Renzhili, North Sichuan Road, Huajia Foreign Company at No. 2 Guangdong Road, Xincheng Foreign Company at No. 7 Yideli, Zililai Street, China Soap Company at No. 18 Huangpu Road, etc. Chen Guoliang, a customs broker from the China Soap Company, has been arrested, but the others have fled. They are currently being pursued.</p>

<p>After Su Kunnian was arrested, he stated that the United Company was the Huayang Company three months ago, and Wang Yushu was the manager. They had been doing this for about two years, about four or five times a month, for a total of over 100 times. Each time, about ten or more people could divide 500 or 600 yuan from the 35% share. The procedures were so sophisticated that even senior officials could not detect them. The people involved in the past are all wealthy now. The clerks Wang Yueren, Shi Cunjiao, Wei Anxiang, etc., admitted that they each received 600 yuan for the Ruifeng Foreign Company's nine automobile case. Therefore, Shu Bo from the Anti-Smuggling Section of the Tax Office also went to court yesterday to apply for prosecution. The prosecutor ordered the defendant to be detained. Judge Xiao Xiefen briefly questioned Lin and ordered Lin Ziruan to provide bail so that he could be summoned at any time. After the investigation is clear, the hearing will be rescheduled for August 1st.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Local Ruffians Are Extremely Ferocious <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Huang A'mei's Extortion Attempt Fails</p>
<p>He Steals and Uses an Axe to Attack People</p>
<p>Shen Youzhang, the owner of the Huazhang Construction Factory on Hongqiao Road, is located at No. 276 Yangjialou Road, owned by the Public Works Department. He recently contracted a construction project next to the factory. When construction began in June of this year, Huang A'mei, a local ruffian, went to the factory on the 25th of the same month to demand customary fees. The factory owner, Shen Youzhang, was not at the factory at the time. The ruffian left a business card and said he would come back in three days. If they did not pay, he would "give them a piece of his mind." Unexpectedly, that night, nineteen pieces of pine lumber and one water tap, worth about one hundred yuan, were lost. The factory owner reported it to the Sixth District First Police Station, and Huang A'mei was arrested and sent to the Public Security Bureau for transfer to the court for trial. However, at about 1:00 AM the night before last, a group of thirty or forty thugs, traveling in cars, armed with pistols, axes, and daggers, surrounded the factory, opened the factory gate, and declared that they were avenging Huang A'mei. At that time, only two watchmen, Mao Niande and Shen Changxing, were on night duty. The thugs, without asking any questions, brutally beat the two watchmen. Mao Niande's legs were slashed three times with an axe, and Shen Changxing was stabbed in the back and legs with a dagger. Both fell to the ground in extreme pain, bleeding profusely. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the thugs looted three bags of water pipe elbows, worth about 400 yuan, before leaving in their cars. Afterwards, the factory owner, Shen Youzhang, arrived after hearing the alarm and sent the two injured watchmen to the Haig Road Red Cross Hospital for treatment. He also reported the incident to the Sixth District Headquarters and the Sixth District First Police Station, urging them to severely arrest the thugs and bring them to justice. It is said that the factory owner, Shen Youzhang, believes that this group of ruffians and gangsters has many accomplices and dared to take revenge and commit robbery with weapons at night. If they are not severely punished, how can public order be maintained and the law upheld? Yesterday, he again submitted a report to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, requesting that the court be asked to return the ruffian Huang A'mei for questioning his accomplices in order to detain and prosecute them according to the law.</p>

<p>Indicate Route Clearly for Sorting</p>
<p>According to Shanghai Post Office news, airmail and parcels can be sent by the sender specifying a certain segment of the route to be sent by air, while the rest of the route is sent by ordinary mail. However, this is limited to cases where it can actually reduce the delivery time and the required postage is fully paid. All airmail and parcels sent in this way should clearly indicate the route specified for air transport on the envelope or parcel cover to facilitate sorting and avoid errors. It is even more appropriate to indicate this next to the (Airmail) printed on the prescribed airmail envelope or blue label.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to various industry associations, ordering them to prohibit commercial companies from offering cash prizes. The original letter stated: "Respected Sirs, on the 27th of this month, we received Instruction No. 13855 from the Social Affairs Bureau, which stated: 'Regarding compliance matters, we have received Municipal Government Instruction No. 6295, which forwarded Finance Ministry Letter No. 6725, stating that the central government's issuance of Aviation and Highway Construction Lottery Tickets is related to major construction plans and is currently being actively promoted. Therefore, it is not permissible for other organs, groups, companies, or stores to imitate this. The China East Tobacco Company's awarding of lottery tickets is tantamount to printing counterfeit tickets, as is the Swiss-Luen Tobacco Company's Company Brand Champagne Coupons, the Fuxin Company's Holmes Brand Promotion Coupons, the Huapin Tobacco Company's Golden Arrow Brand Sales Promotion Coupons, and the Great Southeast Tobacco Company's High and Rich Coupons. Although the names are different, they all involve cash prizes. If it is for commercial competition, other methods of attracting customers should be devised, always adhering to the principle of not using cash rewards for customers so as not to hinder the government's major construction plans. From now on, if other tobacco companies and commercial companies still offer similar cash prizes, please pay special attention and stop them at any time.' We have recorded this order and forwarded it to you. We hereby instruct your association to notify its members that if they are offering cash prizes, they should stop immediately and devise other methods of attracting customers in order to comply with government orders."</p>

<p>The French Consul General in Shanghai sent a letter yesterday to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating that in response to the letter from your Chamber's Vice Chairman Wang on the 4th of this month regarding the matter of nude exercise, he immediately ordered the French Police Department to investigate. According to their report, there are no nude exercise groups in Shanghai. As for the news that a Czechoslovakian national will soon arrive in Shanghai to organize a nude party, it appears to be baseless. In any case, the Consul General guarantees that if such a thing were to happen, he would take the necessary measures to maintain public order. This letter is for your information.</p>

<p>The Chen Fengh Heng Cotton Cloth Shop at 190 Avenue Edward VII is a cotton cloth shop founded by Wang Qingchen (60 years old), a merchant from Yangzhou. It is one of the major cotton cloth shops in the area of Rue du Consulat, employing more than 20 clerks. It has been open for more than eight years and its business has been quite successful. Last night, at around 7:00 p.m., while the clerks were having dinner in the back hall, someone threw a bomb into the shop from the street. With a loud bang, the explosion shook the neighborhood, and passersby scattered. The police station of the Great Clock Tower was nearby, and the head constable, 各米也立, immediately led Western detective 巨也脫, Chinese detective Wu Wengang, and others to the scene to investigate. Only eight glass windows were damaged, and no one was injured. Detective Wu found several pieces of the damaged bomb casing on the ground and took them back to the police station for investigation.</p>

<p>Seriously Injured by the Fall and Cannot Be Saved</p>
<p>Yu Weiqing, a native of Ningbo, 42 years old, worked as an old clerk in the Shi Weiji Clock Shop at 474 Nanking Road. At around 11:00 a.m. the day before yesterday, the shop's large signboard flag was suddenly blown by the wind, causing it to lean. The shop ordered Weiqing to repair it on the third floor. Unexpectedly, when he reached the top of the ladder, one of the horizontal supports he was standing on suddenly broke, causing him to fall. He was seriously injured. A colleague, Zhou Zhongyong, saw what happened and immediately told the shop owner, who sent him to the Renji Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and he died soon after. The hospital reported to the Old Gate Police Station, which ordered Detective Pang Yutang to investigate. The body was taken to the Fei Lun Road Mortuary. Yesterday morning, Judge Guo Wei from the First Special District Local Court was dispatched to the mortuary to examine the body. Zhou Zhongyong testified that Yu also worked in the shop and was on duty that day when he saw that the flag outside was crooked, so the shop ordered Yu and the deceased to repair it. He had placed the bamboo ladder outside the window on the third floor, and the deceased had run up to repair it, while he was at the bottom of the ladder to prevent it from falling. Unexpectedly, when he reached the highest point, the support he was standing on suddenly broke, causing him to fall. Judge Guo accepted the testimony and ruled that the deceased Yu Weiqing died from a head injury caused by the fall. The body was handed over to his wife, Yu Wangshi, to be taken back for burial.</p>

It was not until now that Jin Jiulin, the chief inspector of the special branch of the French Police, Detective Qian Yumin, Detective Liu Dianlong, and others learned that Ma Lianfa (33 years old), a native of Danyang, was hiding in his hometown. He was arrested by the Danyang Public Security Bureau for a kidnapping case, and the police immediately reported to the West Detective Chief and requested the Second Special Court to prepare a document, and Jin Jiulin led Detective Qian and Detective Liu to the Danyang Public Security Bureau to transfer Ma to Shanghai. Yesterday, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. Judge Wang Gangxu interrogated him. Police attorney Yuan Jiahuang stated that the police had not yet investigated the case and requested that the defendant be detained temporarily and the case be investigated and prosecuted at a later date.

This gun was the same gun that was used to kill Chen Mingxian, the township head of Chenjiabaixiang Township and the head of the Security Corps, and his wife and unborn child. He requested that Hua Apei be summoned for questioning. After hearing the report, the director of the Bureau, Liu Guiting, immediately sent police to summon Hua. According to Hua Apei's confession, he was working on the west side of the Xiyue Temple Road on the 28th or 29th of last month when he saw a gun exposed next to his deceased brother's coffin, took it back and hid it, and entrusted a villager, Xu Anbang, to sell it to Zhu Qiuting, the vice-head of the seventh jia of the second district of the Security Corps, for 45 yuan, of which 30 yuan had been paid. He admitted that he had handed over the gun to Zhu Qiuting to take away. After obtaining the confession, the questioning officer sent police, led by villager Xu Anbang and Chen Jinxian, the brother of the deceased township head Chen Mingxian, to search next to Hua Apei's deceased brother's coffin. Unexpectedly, they found two submachine guns and two rifles. One Russian-style rifle had a Baoshan County brand mark, confirming that it was the gun of the deceased Chen Mingxian. They were all brought back to the Bureau. Also, at around 3:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, the Bureau received a report from the plaintiff Chen Jinxian stating that a man named Wu Hai was peddling a gun bolt in Chenjiabaixiang. Later, he sold two more to Jin Yuanyi for 21 yuan each. When Wu brought the two gun bolts, they detained him and reported to the Bureau. Upon interrogation, Wu Hai confessed that he was 26 years old, a native of Tongzhou, and lived in Yanjiata. The gun bolt was entrusted to him by a man named Xiao Xu to sell, so he went to Chenjiabaixiang to sell it to Jin Yuanyi for 21 yuan. He admitted that it was true, but he only took 10 yuan at that time. Later, Jin asked him if he had any more gun bolts, so he sent two more today (i.e., the day before yesterday), but they were caught. Later, Director Liu asked him if he knew anything about the shooting of Chen Mingxian. He replied that he did not know, but he did sell guns. On November 24 of last year, he, Chen Hongtao, and Zhou Zhaoyue bought 610 bullets from Chen Ming, and were caught by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau's Detective Team while passing through Zhenru and served a three-month sentence. After verifying the confession, the questioning officer sent police to the Zhabei Fourth District Public Security Bureau and police detectives to arrest Xiao Xu at the Tanziqiao this morning (i.e., yesterday morning) and bring him back to the Bureau. Upon interrogation, Xiao Xu confessed that his surname was Yu, his name was Dasan, he was 32 years old, and he was a native of Funing. He did not admit that his surname was Xu. He lowered his head and stammered about the matter of entrusting him to sell the gun bolt. Director Liu suspected that the defendants were involved in the case of the shooting of Chen Mingxian and his wife, as well as his pregnant child, in Chenjiabaixiang, and the theft of the guns, so he ordered that the defendants Wu Hai and Xiao Xu (i.e., Yu Dasan), together with the three gun bolts and the three rifles and two submachine guns in the Hua Apei case, be sent to the Baoshan County Government for trial at around 4:00 p.m. yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Zhang Er, a Suspect in the Baoshan Kidnapping Case, Arrested <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Er, a native of Qingkou, 34 years old, fled to Shanghai after committing the crime of colluding with others to kidnap people and extort ransoms in Baoshan County. He lived at 29 Fulan Lane, 157 Pingliang Road. The day before yesterday, Wang Shouzhang, the captain of the Fifth District Detective Team of the Baoshan County Public Security Bureau, came to Shanghai based on the confession of the arrested Li Changqing, and reported to the Yulin Road Police Station. The detectives went to the address and arrested Zhang Er. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Local Court. Judge Xiao Xiefen interrogated him. Police attorney Zhang Tianyin stated that according to the investigation by Wang Shouzhang, the captain of the Detective Team of the Baoshan Public Security Bureau, the defendant, together with the arrested Li Changqing, kidnapped nine members of Li Fengming's family on August 22 of last year and extorted a large sum of money before fleeing to Shanghai. Now, Baoshan County Magistrate Jin has sent an official letter requesting that the defendant be transferred. If Zhang admits to being involved, he does not object to the transfer; otherwise, please detain him and wait for Li Changqing to be brought to court for questioning next time to comply with the agreed procedures. He then presented the county's official letter. Detective Team Captain Wang Shouzhang claimed that all nine members of the Li family had been released long ago. According to Li Changqing's confession, the defendant participated in the discussion before the kidnapping and was responsible for guarding the hostages after the kidnapping. He had planned to bring Li Changqing to court to identify the defendant, but he was afraid that it would be inconvenient and unexpected events would occur en route. Moreover, the victim is a villager, and according to local customs, they are timid and unwilling to come to court to testify. He then presented Li Changqing's confession. Zhang Er, when questioned, firmly denied any involvement in the kidnapping case and said that he did not know Li Changqing either. He should be investigated. The police attorney also stated that the case should be postponed and Li should be brought to the court to testify. More detectives should be prepared to protect him during the journey. Judge Xiao reviewed the confession and ordered the defendant to be returned to custody, ordering the Baoshan Public Security Bureau to provide relevant evidence for review.</p>

<p>Dear Editor, The article "Zou Xianzhang Embezzles Funds and Flees" published in your newspaper on the 24th of this month is slightly different from the facts. My daughter, Yueying, has always been very well-behaved. This time, she was encouraged by her sisters to work at Xuyuan. Although the parents did not agree, she was still able to maintain her integrity. Since your newspaper reported it, relatives and parents have questioned her severely, believing that their reputation is at stake. Yueying has always denied having any relationship with Zou. For the sake of my daughter's reputation, I am writing to request that your newspaper make a correction. Sincerely, Wang Zhangji, July 29th.</p>

<h3 id="e194">Situation at Shanghai Business College Heard Yesterday <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Ministry of Education Cables, Appoints Professor Zhen He</p>
<p>Professor Jiang Xiangqing Recounts His Service</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th) The Ministry of Education has learned from news reports that Shanghai Business College has already appointed professors for the coming year. This matter should first be verified and approved by the Ministry. On the 29th, a cable was sent to the college inquiring whether this was true.</p>
<p>It is further reported that students at the National Shanghai Business College, due to the failure to achieve their goal of restoring the Central University's Business School (i.e., restoring the Business School of Central University), have caused a disturbance. The Ministry of Education is sending Section Chief Xie Shuying to Shanghai to investigate (before the general examination).</p>
<p>After Xie's arrival, some people pointed out issues with the college's operations, including the salary of Professor Jiang Xiangqing, alleging that Jiang's salary suddenly increased from 120 yuan to 240 yuan, an act of favoritism. According to Jiang, such remarks are akin to veiled slander. Originally, he held a concurrent position, but due to repeated requests from students and the president, he agreed to become a full-time professor starting last semester, to meet the expectations of the school and students. Having switched to a full-time position, he naturally deserves the treatment of a full-time professor. As for the so-called "favoritism," he does not know what it refers to. Before serving at the Business College, he had little or no contact with the several presidents who had come and gone, nor with any of the college's professors or students. This is a demonstrable fact. The students' request for him to become full-time began last summer. At that time, he was unable to leave his teaching position at another school. By last winter, the student union submitted a request to the school authorities for a full-time appointment letter and dispatched representatives twice for further negotiations. He reluctantly resigned from his other school position and became a full-time professor at the Business College. The student union's request and the two announcements from the student union in the college magazine are recorded below:</p>
<p>Letter from the Student Union to Jiang Xiangqing: Dear Mr. Xiangqing, since your arrival at our school, your rich experience and enthusiastic guidance have revitalized the stagnant athletic atmosphere of our school. In addition to being grateful and inspired, the students humbly request that you serve as a full-time professor at our school next semester, so that our students can benefit and learn more in their studies and cultivation. In addition to submitting a separate request to the school authorities, we hereby send this special letter of request, respectfully praying for your generous agreement. With best regards, (Seal of the National Shanghai Business College Student Union)</p>
<p>January 6, 1933</p>
<p>Announcement from the Student Union: The announcement from the student union in the 97th issue of the college magazine states: "The students of our college are diligent and studious, and have always been praised by people in society, and are particularly interested in sports. The authorities are also strongly advocating it in order to cultivate healthy and promising youth. Since the arrival of athletic expert Mr. Jiang Xiangqing to serve as a guide, the results have been steadily improving for several years. This semester, we are working even harder, and various ball teams have been established one after another. The external competitions and internal practices are very popular for a time. However, Mr. Jiang is very busy with official duties and also serves as a professor at other schools. His guidance to our college is also of a concurrent nature, so he cannot be a full-time mentor. The students are all deeply regretful. In the past, President Xu and the students have repeatedly requested Mr. Jiang to come to the college full-time, so that he can study with the students day and night and develop the college's sports to the best possible level. Later, due to the resolute retention of other schools, it was not possible. Recently, we reiterated the previous request and expressed our sincere desire to Mr. Jiang, asking him to do his best to decline the teaching position at other schools and serve full-time at our college. It is heard that Mr. Jiang is unable to refuse the enthusiasm of the faculty and students of our college and has agreed. If so, the development of sports in our college from next semester can be imagined. It is hoped that Mr. Jiang will certainly accept this sincere request and strive to realize it, which is what the faculty and students of our college are looking forward to." Jiang's spirit of sportsmanship: Jiang is known for his loyalty and straightforwardness. He has always held a "stay if we agree, leave if we don't" attitude. According to him, he has returned the appointment letter for the 22nd year (i.e., from August 1st to July 31st of the following year) to the college. From August 1st, he will not ask or care about anything related to the college. He also said that he usually gets along well with his colleagues and students. This time, due to the student unrest, he wanted to avoid getting involved in the vortex because he also held the position of student affairs director (i.e., moral education), but he was not allowed by the facts. Therefore, he did not hesitate to speak earnestly and repeatedly to the students to fulfill his duties of influencing and guiding them. When persuasion was ineffective and advice was not heeded, he continued to stop them. As a result, he, who was once welcomed by the students, is now resented by them. At the same time, two or three colleagues on the other side, who were usually friendly, have now, due to the student unrest, developed differences or even become enemies because of their different views and opinions. Speaking of this, he is heartbroken, and thinking of it, he is painful. In short, because of the student unrest, he sold his friends and made enemies. Everything in the past is unbearable to look back on. He is by nature responsible, which has caused him pain. Clever people ridicule him as a relic of the times. He said that since the times are like this, he can only accept it. He finally said, "I am a sportsman. Although I absolutely do not admit that the past actions were inappropriate, in order to comply with the sportsmanship and creed of 'be a good loser', I have decided to resign, which is to show my sportsmanship."</p>

The scale column is erected to indicate the depth of the water, and there is a lifeboat available, so there is no danger. Therefore, the atmosphere has been renewed.

<h3 id="e205">The Grand Occasion of the Challenge Round <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>Before noon today, the ticket office of the Roland Garros tennis court was crowded with people. By 11:00, the tickets had been sold out. Those who arrived later, in the hope of entering, tried to break into the court, but were turned back by a large group of police officers. At 1:00 PM, the venue was packed. At 2:20, President Lebrun entered the venue and was warmly welcomed by the audience. At 2:47, Merlin served, and the first singles match between Britain and France began.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Austin First Wins Over Merlin <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>First Set, First Game, Merlin won, in an easier manner, but afterwards the competition became more intense, and Austin's skills gradually became more obvious, but Merlin also worked hard to resist. Austin won four games in a row, making it 4-1, then 4-2, 5-2, Merlin regained a game, making it 5-3, but Austin finally won 6-3.</p>
<p>Second Set, Austin won four games in a row, Merlin worked hard to counterattack, making it 4-4 tie, but Austin won two more games in a row and won 6-4.</p>
<p>Third Set, Austin won three games in a row, and after a fierce competition in the fourth game, Austin still won 6-0. Although Merlin lost, his ability to make Austin feel that he was not easy to deal with in his first international competition with a master Austin is commendable.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Penley Also Defeats Cochet <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>First Set, in the second match, Cochet was wearing shorts, while Penley was wearing long trousers, which was quite interesting. When the two entered the venue, more than 15,000 spectators gave them a warm welcome. At the beginning of the match, Cochet made Penley run around tiredly, but Penley tried his best to resist. His skills are noteworthy. Cochet once took a 4-1 lead, but Penley made it 4-4 tie. The two sides then won four games each, making it 8-8. Then Cochet, like a horse out of rein, could no longer be controlled and won two games in a row, winning the first set 10-8.</p>
<p>Second Set, Cochet once took a 4-2 lead, but Penley won four games in a row and won 6-4 instead.</p>
<p>Third Set, the competition situation was still fierce. If one of the two temporarily took the lead, the other would immediately counterattack and make it a tie. Penley once took a 6-5 lead, and only needed to win one more ball to win the third set, but Cochet made it 6-6. However, Penley finally won two more games in a row and won 8-6.</p>
<p>Fourth Set, after the break, the match continued. Penley, seeing that he could win the match if he won another set, tried hard to make Cochet submit. Penley once had a 3-1 lead. At this point, Cochet went to the net to intercept and won five games in a row, winning 6-3.</p>
<p>Fifth Set, Penley had a clear advantage, and Cochet, exhausted, had difficulty coping. Penley won five games first, and Cochet regained one game, but Penley finally won 6-1.</p>
<p>(Havas News Agency, Paris, 29th) The Davis Cup Challenge Round doubles match was almost postponed due to the rain at first, but it still started at 4:00 PM in the afternoon. There were many spectators. The British team players have been changed. Penley will be replaced by Lee. The French team won the first set 6-3.</p>

<h3 id="e211">On Reading the Classics <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Nineteen</p>
<p>Recently, enlightened people, seeing the prevalence of heresy, want to add a classics reading course in schools to correct the morals of the present decadent society and to rectify people's hearts. This is indeed right. The words of the sages are like the sun and moon traversing the sky and the rivers flowing on the earth. Since the Han Dynasty, which scholar could escape the study of the classics if they wanted to gain an official position? The Han Dynasty established professors of the Five Classics, and the Song Dynasty used the meaning of the classics to select scholars. During that time, many famous officials and great Confucians emerged. Those who want to make a living by writing know this. Therefore, although some people regard reading the classics as reversing the times, I ultimately believe that it is beyond reproach.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to the classics, quantitatively speaking, according to Duan Yucai's definition, there are as many as twenty-one kinds. Young students have many courses and little time, so it is difficult to read them one by one. Qualitatively speaking, Yan Ruoqu spent twenty or thirty years of textual research to determine that the Book of Documents was a forgery. This shows that "exhaustively studying the classics" is also very difficult.</p>
<p>If we talk about selective reading, it is indeed feasible, but I believe that the selection of materials is also highly debatable. I offer my humble opinion as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Those that run counter to the trend of the times should not be selected. "The people can be made to follow it, but not to know it" is inconsistent with "democracy." "Men should be in their proper position outside, and women should be in their proper position inside" is also incompatible with the principle of "equality between men and women."</p>
<p>"Do not enter a dangerous country, do not live in a chaotic country" encourages people to take a passive attitude towards national affairs. All of these should not be selected as teaching materials.</p>
<p>(2) Those involving love and sexuality should not be selected. "Climbing over the wall of the eastern neighbor to seduce his daughter; seducing her can lead to marriage, not seducing her will not lead to marriage" and the chapter on the people of Qi having one wife and one concubine are both wonderful passages by Mencius, but they should not be selected. Zhang Sheng jumping over the pink wall is due to the poison of the former; the rich keeping concubines is due to the demon of the latter. Furthermore, the Book of Songs, it seems that everyone now knows that most of the odes of the fifteen states are folk love songs. In fact, this saying "has existed since ancient times." Huang Chaoying of the Song Dynasty mentioned this in his "Xiang Su Ji" long ago, but it has only become popular recently. If you select the odes of the states as teaching materials, how is it different from selecting the tune of "Sister, I love you"? Isn't it the same as teaching lewdness? The "male and female essences combine, and all things are created" in the Book of Changes should not be selected as teaching materials. If students want to study the "essence combination" problem, how will the teacher deal with it? Moreover, modern education emphasizes interest the most. If the teacher fully explains the meaning of this sentence, he will become Zhang Boshu II. Conversely, if he pretends not to know or speaks vaguely, the students will say, "You don't even understand this." As for the things like "Duke Xuan of Wei committing incest with a barbarian concubine" in Zuo Zhuan, it is even more out of the question and should not be selected as teaching materials to avoid harming the descendants of generations of noble families.</p>
<p>The above is what I consider dangerous, and I dare not remain silent. Is it appropriate? I dare to ask the enlightened people who advocate reading the classics.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Bridge <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Broken Cauldron</p>
<p>Many children are swimming under the bridge, swimming, swimming past, and swimming back. Some are standing, holding checkered earth cloth towels, wiping their bodies for a while, but then squeezing back into the water! Some are chasing and fighting, like frogs, splashing water, laughing, and shouting.</p>
<p>Several children are standing on the bridge, watching, laughing, and shouting along. Some adults are sitting on the stone bridge railings, waving palm-leaf fans, chatting idly. Suddenly, "plop," there is a sound, and another naked child somersaults into the water. It takes a long time before he shows his head.</p>
<p>There is a cattle herder, holding the cow with one hand and a pair of cloth shoes in the other. He runs over, humming a little tune. Watching, he ties the cow to the willow tree by the river. He rolls up the legs of his trousers, puts his shoes on the ground beside him, sits under the willow tree, and washes his feet, "splash, splash." A storyteller, beating a long drum and a gong, holding the stick in his hand, kissing the stone ground, "da-da-da," he comes over, followed by a crowd of people. He steps onto the bridgehead and sits on the railing: "dong-dong-tui, dong-dong-tui, tui-tui-tui-tui, dong-dong-tui," beating, beating.</p>
<p>"Hey, storyteller! How much to sing 'Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai'?" someone asks.</p>
<p>"Six dimes. I'm used to singing it, no bargaining."</p>
<p>"Well, it's six dimes. Six dimes is public money. Children don't count. There are sixteen people here, so six dimes is one hundred and forty-four copper coins. Six nines are fifty-four, one nine is nine, one hundred and forty-four copper coins. Everyone takes out nine copper coins!" another says.</p>
<p>The long drum and gong start beating again! The storyteller opens his husk-like throat and sings: "Speaking news, telling news, news happened in..."</p>
<h3 id="e213">Son <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Virtuous Virtuous</p>
<p>"At thirty, no son is a mediocre life; at forty, no son is a lonely life; at fifty, no son is unrespected; at sixty, no son is as bitter as Coptis chinensis." Sons are generally sweet. "Having wealth without a son is not considered rich; having a son without wealth is not considered poor." So sons are like the first prize of the aviation highway lottery, worth 500,000.</p>
<p>Guanyin Bodhisattva knows how to grant sons, and the Earth God also knows how to grant sons. No wonder the news of "one birth of three children" is often printed on posters and sold. Originally, as long as you are "sincere, you will be effective," what do you have to fear? You will "seek a son and get a son," "every request will be answered." No wonder China's population has changed from 400 million to 470 million in one fell swoop. Poor men "with sons but no wealth" are dragging a group of snotty big sons and scabby-headed little sons. Each of them is a rich man, I must apologize for my disrespect. I can't get pregnant, even after marrying five or six concubines. For eight or ten years, I can't even break wind, let alone have a fat-headed, big-eared son. Every year, I go to India to offer incense, pray to gods and worship Buddhas, repair myself externally and internally, and eat seed elixirs as food, but it's still the same. Seeing that such a big fortune will belong to others when I kick the bucket, how can I not be anxious? But what if I have a son? Won't I still see King Yama empty-handed?</p>
<p>"Foolish parents have always been many, but who has seen filial grandchildren?"</p>
<p>Since Adam and Eve until now, there has been no breaking of the new record of "Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars." Those who commit crimes and "bring disaster to their illustrious fathers" are "readily available," but those who are "unconscious of suffering" cannot be found even with a lantern. "The old master is dead." "Let me finish my sixteenth game of mahjong." Okay, think about it. A son, this is also a son sent by Guanyin Bodhisattva and the Earth God.</p>
<p>After saying so much bad things about sons, everyone is afraid of being scared by sons, right? Don't be afraid. Having a son is like winning the lottery. Although the first prize is 500,000, it is not guaranteed, but at the moment when the "prize is about to be announced," the tip of the tongue and the space between the teeth are always sweet, and that is enough. "Raising a son to guard against old age" still seems unbreakable.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Casual Talk on Cartoons <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Qian Yun, Drawn by Dong Liang</p>
<p>Contradictory Reality</p>
<p>How majestic was Coachman A-da! Nothing special, it was when he started singing the Five Watches and Ten Farewells and crying for the Seventh Seventh, even though he read many wrong words, it was enough to attract a dozen comrades to surround him and worship him.</p>
<p>When he was free, he would mop the floor in his master's study. He then lamented and thought: This is because his master knows more words and can work at a desk and ride in a car. Because I know fewer words, I dare to be downgraded to the floor and pull a cart. Friend A-er, if you can read "Yang Yanhui Sits in the Palace Courtyard, Thinking to Himself..." hasn't he changed to sitting on a soft cushion in a car? So he is not like me, earning only ten yuan a month!</p>
<p>His thinking is not wrong, because there is no big boss in the study who is illiterate. But there are also contradictions, for example, among the tens of millions of unemployed people in Shanghai, there are many college students and students who have studied abroad. It is difficult to find something like A-da's salary! If they really went to pull a cart, they wouldn't have the strength.</p>
<p>Of course, this is not advocating not to study. It's just that the way out after studying has really become a problem! If I have a son (it's better not to have a son), I will definitely ask him to work and study from a young age. This part-time job, whether it's picking up trash on the road or enduring the hardships of the wind and frost, is to avoid not being able to find food in the future. If I don't write, I can do something like a coachman. The reason: I don't have an inheritance!</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 12: Poor and Humble Join the Army, Sickly Husband Falls Behind; Sacrifice is Sweet to Resign, Soldiers are Affectionate</p>
<p>This soldier is called Yu Shouzheng. He is someone who graduated from high school and is the most clever in the platoon. Sheng Shimin had not been a soldier for long and thought this was very reasonable. So, starting with the platoon leader, one person went to the merchant, another person went to the merchant, and another person went to the merchant until they reached the battalion commander. This battalion commander didn't want the "embroidery ball wind" to happen in his battalion. Since he wanted to ask for sick leave to go out, he let him go and approved his departure. Zhao Ziqiang couldn't go out for the past two days and was worried because he didn't know what to do, write a letter back, not knowing what the real situation was, so he didn't know what to say in the letter. Now that Sheng Shimin was going out, he could use his words to report the news back. So he gave Sheng Shimin a dollar and told him some words, asking him to see his old master. Sheng Shimin felt that this company commander was too good, and he left the camp with many thanks. He hired a car at the camp gate and went straight to the Zhao family in Haidian. When he arrived at the Zhao family's gate, the dense goose feather snowflakes kept pouring down. Sometimes, a gust of wind blew in the snow, rolling up the branches and dancing a Hu Xuan, rushing straight at people. Sheng Shimin was a sick person and couldn't withstand this kind of severe cold. Getting out of the car, entering the Zhao family's gate, he squatted on the ground and hummed twice. Gui Zhi was moving the coal balls on the ground in the courtyard into the house with a basket, looking up at the sky. The sky was also making things difficult for the poor, snowing so heavily on this day. She suddenly heard a humming sound and was startled. She immediately ran out and looked at the door to see what was going on. She saw Sheng Shimin squatting on the ground with a pale face and couldn't help but take two steps back, holding the wall and looking at him, saying: What are you doing? (143)</p>

<h3 id="e216">Education of the Hand <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Jie Lu</p>
<p>Although people's knowledge and skills all come through... but the eyes are the "gate of knowledge" and the ears are the "palace of learning." Those with nimble ears are called "smart," and those with nimble eyes are called "bright." Those who see and hear a lot are smart people. The biggest drawback of modern education is that it doesn't regulate the use of the brain and the use of force. There are too many subjects and too many books, so young students often develop myopia, tinnitus, and neurasthenia. Children's bodies and minds have not yet fully developed. What I have always advocated is to impart knowledge through work, and I am strongly opposed to injection-style education. Therefore, I have this contribution on "Education of the Hand":</p>
<p>Try looking at how deaf-mutes study. Don't they rely on their hands? There is still hope for blindness, as long as the hand's instinct doesn't disappear. Today, people only know that intelligence is poured in through the ears and eyes, ignoring the "education of the hand." This is a big shortcoming! The hand is a useful tool for people. It can train the body, create things, and represent meanings. It is really more useful than the ears and eyes. How is it called training the body? Such as driving horses, rowing boats, swinging, playing table tennis, doing Tai Chi, and various exercises, not only can maintain health, but also can promote health. Lively children, come and use your hands to train your bodies! How is it called creating things? It's a long story, but aren't all the things we use in our lives made by hand? We still have to use these hands to create all kinds of new things. For example, the hand can count. The thumb counts as five, the index finger counts as six, the middle finger counts as seven, the ring finger counts as eight, and the little finger counts as nine. Both hands are the same. As long as you bring your fingers together, you can calculate multiplication. For example, six times seven, put the right hand's index finger against the left hand's middle finger. Add the fingers above, which is three, making it the tens place, which is thirty. The fingers below the right hand are four fingers, multiplied by three fingers on the left hand, equals twelve; thirty plus twelve, equals forty-two, which is the product of six times seven. The rest can be inferred. Fingers can also be used to calculate the size of the months of the Gregorian calendar. The method is to count on the knuckles of the fist. The raised ones are big months (thirty-one days), and the recessed ones are small months (thirty days). Count in order, and you won't make a mistake. The only exception is February 28th in a common year and 29th in a leap year. The hand can also project various shapes such as squirrels, sheep, rabbits, dogs, monks, and Taoists in the light, which children like to play with. You can also tie the fingers together to form many names. How is it called representing meaning? We know that there is "flag language" in the Boy Scouts, which can represent speech. The hand also has this wonderful use. When children are kicking shuttlecocks and playing with balls, they often turn the little hands and palms over and over again to represent picking, doesn't this resemble raising a hand to represent meaning during a meeting? Buying and selling and prices in the stock exchange are all represented by hand, so we know that the hand can indeed represent meaning.</p>

<p>— Zhou Zheng</p>
<p>The majestic sun emitted thousands of fiery rays, ironing everything on the earth as if with an iron.</p>
<p>Only the ants, among the lower insects, were still diligently seeking what they needed in the scorching light. Their feet were scalded; their heads were hot; and their two clever antennae, bumping east and west, also showed a very busy expression.</p>
<p>The mantis, with its strong body and arrogant self-importance, walked forward with an air of confidence.</p>
<p>"Great! With such a great body, who am I afraid of?</p>
<p>Who dares to bully me? As long as I press with my arms, they will die! Hmph, no one can compare to me. I'm so happy! Now I'm very tired, let me take a nap." A mantis, gloating and talking to itself, found a cool place and unknowingly went to dreamland.</p>
<p>It bit hard on the mantis's foot with its sharp teeth, wanting to carry it home. How could a small ant drag such a large mantis?</p>
<p>The ant jumped up quickly, rushing back to report the victory. Its brothers and sisters at home were overjoyed at this good news. They were very much like those who had received military education. They lined up neatly and went hurriedly.</p>
<p>One ant bit the mantis's foot, one ant bit the mantis's head, one ant bit the mantis's stomach...</p>
<p>At this time, the mantis woke up and felt a pain and itch all over its body, which was very uncomfortable. It waved its arms wildly, striking at the ants. Although it knocked back a few, the combined strength was so strong that no one could overcome it. The ants fearlessly charged up and bit the mantis.</p>
<p>In the end, did the arrogant mantis finally realize it?</p>

<h3 id="e218">University Education <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Dafu</p>
<p>In China today, some people advocate that university education is not necessary. Still others argue that the facade of university education must be maintained, otherwise it will not be possible to obtain the Boxer Indemnity funds, but the liberal arts departments are not necessary, or at most, only one or two universities need to be retained to maintain the facade, and the rest are not necessary.</p>
<p>Those who advocate that university education is not necessary say: "What learning does China need? Throughout the country, is there anyone or anything that can prove that they respect learning? Specialists, excellent scholars who graduate from famous universities at home and abroad, some starve to death, some barely make a living by obtaining an official position, and abandon their entire profession. What genuine talent and practical knowledge does China ultimately need?"</p>
<p>Those who advocate not having liberal arts departments but keeping a few universities to maintain the facade say: "The purpose of studying is to become an official. But why does becoming an official in China necessarily require someone from the liberal arts? Look at us! Those who study civil engineering, mining, geology, and applied chemistry, haven't we all become officials here in the same way? Why do we need liberal arts? In turn, it creates many people who only have fantasies and are out of touch with reality, who speak out against authority and plot against the country, which is detrimental to the country. To maintain the facade and obtain foreign funds, it is enough to have a few universities of science and engineering or scientific research institutes."</p>
<p>Both sides have a point, and the actual situation is indeed the case. Just look at those who are issuing orders and serving the party and the country in China today, aren't they all people who have received university education? However, here I have a small question. I think it is true that learning should be applied, but the cultivation of personality is of course an important function of education. Those who can uphold their beliefs, willingly starve to death, and disdain to conform to the world and flatter others, can justifiably prove the victory of education. There is only a shortage of universities that can cultivate these talents, and there is no reason why they are not necessary. Secondly, even from the perspective of "learning to be applied," is it really the only purpose of studying to become an official? Distributing China's entire population, are there too many liberal arts graduates? Not to mention remote and desolate areas, even in towns and cities slightly farther from the metropolis, how many liberal arts graduates with clear minds are there who handle affairs and guide the masses? The reason why illiterate local bullies and unscrupulous gentry and slightly capable litigious and scoundrels run rampant is because university education is not universal and thorough enough! If we say that university education is not necessary, then educational administrative organs and many other nominal and exploitative organizations that only know how to collect money from the people can be dispensed with first. Is the purpose of university education really just to become an official and cheat money?</p>
<h3 id="e219">The "Usefulness" and "Uselessness" of Literature <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Another Realm</p>
<p>The root of the so-called "literature is useless" argument probably lies in a few words from Mr. Ye Shengtao's "Wartime Notes." Mr. Ye said:</p>
<p>"If you say to write propaganda, the propaganda power of the soldiers' own actions is a thousand times stronger than words. If you say to create artistic works that express the spirit of resistance, China is a country where a book selling 10,000 copies is considered a very impressive sales figure. On this point, I think those who hold pens should decline."</p>
<p>This is equivalent to Mr. Zhuan Donghua advising people not to take the path of studying literature in his article "This Road is Impassable" (see the New Year Special Issue of Reading Magazine). These are all words "filled with emotion." If someone rashly thinks that Mr. Ye and Mr. Zhuan are "believers in the uselessness of literature" because of this, it is actually extremely wrong. Mr. Ye is working hard to create, and Mr. Zhuan is busy compiling "Literature" because literature is useful.</p>
<p>Therefore, this is not like what Mr. Qi Fan said, "Half of it is the complaint of frustrated idealists, and the other half is a misunderstanding of the nature of learning..." The important thing is that we should distinguish clearly between the essential effectiveness of literature and the effectiveness of literature in real life. Speaking of the former, who can deny the effectiveness of literature's permanent service to society? When it comes to the latter, various realities are placed before us: among the few percent of readers in China, most are still reading masturbatory novels cast from a triangular house, the manuscript fees are so low that they are almost the same as the price of the paper, university graduates are competing with normal school students for jobs, except for literature for studying abroad, the Ministry of Education has ordered the suspension of liberal arts majors, and people in society evaluate those who study literature as "having no expertise," so the only way out for literary people is the "trembling two golden flowers on both sides!" praised by Zhu Maichen to his divorced wife.</p>
<p>With these facts in front of us, a feeling that literature is useless will naturally arise in our minds, unless they are "successful idealists" who have built foreign houses.</p>
<p>However, this does not hinder the recognition of the essence of literature, and the useful value of literature will not disappear with the Ministry of Education's ban on recruiting liberal arts students.</p>
<h3 id="e220">From "Push" to "Take" <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Yang</p>
<p>I heard that there used to be a kind of boxer who had a special massage technique called "tuina" (push and grasp). If someone suffered from a disease like neurasthenia and was as thin as a bamboo pole, they would become as fat as a Buddha after being "tuina"ed for a year or so. Although there is no way to know if this is true or false, it is enough to prove that the ancients also paid attention to "push" and "grasp."</p>
<p>These past couple days, I've seen "Free Talk" discuss "push," and I can't help but feel something. The ancients' "push" seemed to be to activate other people's blood. Today's "push" seems to activate one's own blood. Although the activation of blood is the same, the person being activated is different. In these times, everyone frowns more than smiles. It is difficult for "third-person" to be an exception. Inevitably, sometimes blood rushes to the head. In order to activate one's blood, disregarding the fact that "confused people can't see their enemies clearly," they start "pushing" and "promoting" in a big way. The work of "pushing" is naturally sped up.</p>
<p>When pushing until covered in sweat and breathing heavily, one must first "take." Actually, it doesn't matter if one "takes" first. As Feng Sheng said, the procedure for "pushing" someone who can't afford a boat ticket is to "take" their belongings first. But from what I think, there are many who "push" before "taking." For example, there is often a kind of coachman at the wharf. After you agree to go to a certain place in the British Concession with him, he will carry your luggage onto the carriage and "push" both people and goods to a small inn on Avenue Foch. Then there are young scions with shiny hair, who will present a bill: room fee, carriage fee, wharf fee, tips, and you have to "take" out at least ten dollars. The coachman naturally gets a share. However, the root of the matter is that they "take" more for others and "take" less for themselves. Muddled and confused, they can't recognize their enemies.</p>
<p>Originally, there was nothing wrong with "pushing," but thinking about it afterwards, while you were "pushing" so hard that smoke was coming out of your head, other people were calmly preparing to "take." It's hard not to be ashamed when your enemies are clearly seen!</p>
<h3 id="e221">Trivial Notes on Reading <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Xiaoxue</p>
<p>Reading the recently published "Short Letters of Zhou Zuoren" is like being in the deep mountains amidst ice and snow, giving one a sense of "no thought, no action, all worldly ties severed." It's as if one is reading the "Miscellaneous Letters" of the Wei and Jin dynasties, or admiring the "Short Notes" of Su Dongpo and Huang Tingjian. To call it "modern classical prose," I think nothing could be more fitting.</p>
<p>In his first letter to Yu Pingbo, Zhou Zuoren discussed modern essays and sketches, saying:</p>
<p>"I often say that the essays and sketches of today are not new products since the May Fourth Movement, but are actually 'anciently existing,' only now re-emerging. The small essays of today and the works of the Song and Ming dynasties may be somewhat different in style, but the flavor is actually consistent, or perhaps a little Western influence has been added, giving it a new atmosphere."</p>
<p>This kind of judgment, as an explanation of the superficial phenomenon of the "escapist" essays and sketches of the author's school, I think is very interesting. Zhou Zuoren's short letters are such a product. But what can truly be called modern essays and sketches, things that resonate with the pulse of modern social life, will never be like this.</p>
<p>Let's talk about life. In Zhou Zuoren's short letters, what kind of life is written about in the so-called "fragmentary words"? From beginning to end, what is unfolded is nothing more than the following scene:</p>
<p>Reading ancient books, looking at peanuts, inquiring about illness, "Lotus White Wine," "eating blessing tea," idle travel, idle lying, leisure, inviting people for casual chats, writing楹聯, buying books, archaeology, printing ancient-style envelopes and stationery, engraving seals, talking about印泥, talking about dreams, banquets, inviting monks to chant sutras, collecting stamps, carving woodblock books, sitting under the rustling south window.</p>
<p>What he does is completely the life of "ancient hermits," completely isolated from the intense "modern" life. If you also remove the "brandy," "movies," "soda," "beer," "curry rice," "telephone," "proletarian literature," "Don Quixote," "Saturday," "week," "airmail," and a dozen other new terms from the letters, these slight traces of modern life, then, to make a joke, one would not know if it were a posthumous work of Luo Guanzhong or a lost manuscript of Shi Nai'an.</p>
<p>"The more evil the world, the more one turns to leisure" (Letter 32 to Pingbo). How can a person living like this – sitting in "Bitter Rain Studio," "Medicine Cottage," "Bitter Tea Hermitage," playing with seals of the "lotus eater" type, "writing manuscripts to earn a little money for wine" – not be "out of step with body and mind" (the author's words)? "Writing essays is a way to nourish the spirit" (Letter 9 to Fei Ming). The author's understanding is such, so it is no wonder that readers cannot see any images of social life through his personal life.</p>
<p>The author says (Letter 8 to Pingbo):</p>
<p>"A person's attitude towards life is constantly changing, how can one maintain it for thirteen or fourteen years? I, your unworthy servant, examine myself and find that my thoughts have become increasingly decadent, how can I still have the impetuous and aggressive spirit of the May Fourth period?"</p>
<p>From being a warrior in the May Fourth period, gradually turning one's life completely away from "reality," and calling one's most glorious period "impetuous and aggressive," this is of course one of the inevitable tendencies of the result of the conflict between the individual and society, there is nothing strange about it; but, here, readers can also see how cruelly the wheels of history are progressing. The author of today is no longer the author of thirteen or fourteen years ago, however, what has been destroyed by the wheels of history is not just the author alone...</p>
<p>After reading a part of "Zhou Zuoren's Letters" (Beixin edition), I felt a lot and picked up my pen to write this "trivial note." I wonder what other people who read this book will think.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Pearl S. Buck, Author of "The Good Earth" <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Yixian</p>
<p>Ms. Pearl S. Buck, whose Chinese name is Wen Xiang, is from Virginia, USA. She was only four months old when her parents brought her to China. Her father, Dr. Sai Zhaoxiang (Absalom Sydenstricker), was a Presbyterian missionary who preached in Qingjiang, Zhenjiang, and other places. He wrote many religious books and translated part of the New Testament. In his later years, he was a professor of theology at Jinling University in Nanjing. In the summer of 1931, he died of dysentery in Lushan, at the age of eighty. Her mother was also a missionary, and was very accomplished in literature, art, and music. She died early.</p>
<p>When Ms. Buck was young, she lived with her parents in a quiet cottage on a small hill near the county seat of Qingjiang. Her playmates, besides her sister, were all local Chinese children. She received her preliminary education from her mother. According to Ms. Buck's interview with a reporter from the New York Times, her mother "not only taught her the general curriculum of elementary school, but also gave her an appreciation for art and music, and, more importantly, made her aware of the pleasure of words themselves."</p>
<p>Because her missionary mother had many Chinese friends, Ms. Buck often went in and out of Chinese homes. She not only became familiar with Chinese customs, but also understood the inner pain of the Chinese working masses and housewives. She also had an old nanny who often told her stories of her childhood, famine, and bandits while sitting and mending socks or doing something else, giving her a deep impression. She lived among the Chinese in this way from childhood, so when she later came to study in schools in Shanghai, she hardly felt any difference between herself and the Chinese.</p>
<p>At the age of seventeen, Ms. Buck returned to the United States via Europe and studied at Randolph-Macon Woman's College in Virginia. She graduated with particularly good literary results and won the highest prize, a beautiful sofa. This sofa is still displayed in her living room. She came to China for the second time and successively served as a professor at Jinling University and Southeast University. In her spare time, she often wrote articles about the state of Chinese society and submitted them to major American magazines such as The Atlantic Monthly, The Nation, and Asia. Over time, Americans recognized her as a "China expert." (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Dan Guosun</p>
<p>"If you want to push it further, then you can only take the bills of lading for the materials in the foreign warehouses and mortgage them to foreign firms. This might get you about ten thousand [dollars]; besides that, the only thing left is the six or seven trucks in the factory, which can be mortgaged for three to five thousand. As for the materials currently in the factory, they don't amount to anything worth mentioning, so I don't need to talk about them. Zhi Guang, isn't this a general ledger of my personal financial resources! Do you think I've missed anything?"</p>
<p>"I don't think so!"</p>
<p>What did Zhi Guang think? What he felt was the failure of his plan. The hardship in Zhabei was truly as he had witnessed, proving that what he had previously heard was not exaggerated. Given the relationship between the two of them and Bo Tang's vision and financial resources, he thought he could persuade him to do something conscientious in Zhabei, but just now, from this general ledger, it was proven that Bo Tang's financial resources were not as abundant as he had previously thought. Of course, material deficiencies are difficult to ignore by finding stimulants! As for Bo Tang, his posture had changed at this time. He pulled his legs up and stepped on the chair, put his hands on his knees, and raised his head to stare at the wall opposite him. Thus, the straight bridge of his nose, which hung on his snow-white, slender face, now took on a horizontal position, just like the bow of a Norwegian three-masted warship. He had fallen into a state of contemplation, a battlefield in his own heart. He firmly believed that Zhi Guang's inspection and report in Zhabei were valuable, and he also believed that the limitations of his own financial resources were very obvious. What he was asking for now was a way to provide assistance that would please everyone, comfort himself, and not cause him trouble in the future. This method was certainly very carefully considered. He weighed it lightly and heavily in his heart, and his straight, ship-bow-like nose swayed left and right with his head; however, Zhi Guang did not realize this, so when he felt that the plan had failed and there was no way to implement it, he suddenly sighed deeply. Who knew that this immediately caused Bo Tang to let out a long sigh as well. Then Bo Tang asked:</p>
<p>"Zhi Guang, which point are you emphasizing with your sigh?"</p>
<p>"Emphasizing?" Zhi Guang said, "Why did I sigh... Perhaps it was because your financial resources have encountered such limitations!... Then, why are you sighing? Which point are you emphasizing?"</p>
<p>"My sigh is to blame myself for not having the courage to go to Zhabei to see for myself sooner! So now I don't have the courage to find a suitable way to provide assistance.... So I really want to go and see for myself tomorrow morning; this is not to do an investigation of your words; the purpose is entirely to arouse my own courage!"</p>

<p>丨Continued Rise of Eleven Dollars, One Dime丨</p>
<p>The gold market rose quite vigorously yesterday, the foreign exchange market was in a state of emergency, making buyers more emboldened. In the early morning, although the British pound rose, the US dollar fell by one dime. Although the forward silver price on the Gold Exchange fell by eight and a half厘, it had rebounded a lot from the previous day, so it had little impact. Stocks fell by a strong dollar. American cotton was slightly below 42 pounds. American wheat also fell by more than five points, but people's minds were at ease because it was reported that the US government issued 3 billion in long-term bonds. The gross price opened low, and it fell to 27 or 28 yuan because Bingxing was selling very fiercely. Ruikang and others then entered, struggling around 30 yuan. After the opening, it rose because the banks were grabbing fiercely, and the situation was very stable. In the middle of the session, it hovered because Bingxing and the Dalian gang were supplying quite strongly. In the end, the demand exceeded the supply, and the banks had a very good appetite, going all the way up. It was most popular at the time of closing. Foreign news was divergent. At first, it was said that the US president still adhered to old views on stabilizing currency and that prices must continue to rise. Although it rose after the opening, it retreated slightly. Later, there were rumors that US dollars were being shipped out again, and people's minds in the market were even more firm. However, the report of the strike at the American silk factory must have been a bullish element, that is, a decrease in our country's exports. The initial red price was increased by 180 yuan. The market situation for the first half of the day is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 828.8 yuan, down 5.7 yuan from the previous close. Goods opened at 30 yuan. The foreign exchange market opened with the recent selling price of British exchange at 1 shilling 3 pence 25, and US exchange at 28.75 yuan, both harder by 0.0625. Daxing Yong Limited purchase was not obtained. Hengyu, Fuyu, Fuchang, Yuanheng, and Yuanxingyong were all tight. Although Bingxing, Yuanmaoyong sold, it rose to 34.5 yuan because Sumitomo HSBC grabbed US dollars for October at 0.25. Reuters reported that the US president's news of raising prices and unwillingness to maintain currency, Zhifengyong Hongxing Hengyu Dafayong late sale, US dollars for October 0.25 were once difficult to sell, and retreated to 1.5 yuan. Magao grabbed US dollars for November 0.375, Qianchangxiang entered steadily, Hengxing's limited purchase was not obtained, and it was hyped to beyond 5 yuan. HSBC's listed British exchange was flat and the US exchange shrunk by 0.125. At the time of the announcement, it hovered around 5 yuan. Hengyu Yuanxingyong Chunyuanyong HSBC grabbed US dollars for November 0.3125, and for October 0.125, then 0.0625 was difficult to settle, and it rose to 8.8 yuan. Huayi even filled US dollars for August 0.75, Bingxing Shuli sold, retreating to 6.3 yuan. Mitsui grabbed US dollars for November 0.25, for October 0.0625, Hengxing Daxingyong Zhengchang Hengyu Zhifengyong Yifengyong and others all entered. 29 yuan for October was difficult to settle, and it rose to 43 yuan. Bingxing sold goods again, falling to 0.02 yuan. Mitsui grabbed US dollars for October 0.9375, Shunli Yuanxingyong entered to 4.5 yuan, After entering, Bingxing Zhaofengchang for goods were on the selling side, Yifengyong Yuanheng then entered, struggling for a long time, finally the foreign exchange market continued to tighten, Xingye grabbed US dollars for October 0.875, and for November 29 yuan, people's minds were greatly encouraged, Zhifengyong Yuanxingyong Daxingyong Richang Shunli scrambled to enter, and it rose to 45.7 yuan, goods were still sold, slightly retreating, but Zhifengyong and others still bought, the midday closing was 845.6 yuan After the close, it was initially flat, goods were photographed at 6 yuan, later Zhifengyong Fuyu Yuanheng and others entered, and it rose to beyond 7 yuan. The highest price in the half-day was 845.7 yuan, and the lowest price was 828.8 yuan, with a fluctuation of 16.9 yuan. As a result, it continued to rise by 11.1 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The announced price was that HSBC's US dollar listing shrank by 0.125, to 28.125 yuan, equivalent to a gold price of 853 yuan, according to the closing price, about less than 8 yuan, about 7 yuan less than the previous close. The registered price for this month is 858 yuan, for August 851 yuan, for September 846 yuan. The water replenishment in the morning was 858 yuan, The price to add at red price was 180 yuan, because the forward standard rose and the road was more stagnant, the swap also lacked formal positions, there are still 2331 notes for this month, 777 notes for August,</p>
<p>In the market transaction, the buying side was bold, in total Bing sold the most notes, (including notes from the Central Exchange Company,) Wanxing Shunli Dafayong Yuanmaoyong Yuanheng and goods Cuitai etc. were on the selling side, Hengxing Hengyu Yuanxingyong Daxingyong Fuyu Zhifengyong Richang Ruikang Yifengyong Zhengchang Qianchangxiang etc. then entered, the Dalian gang Wanxing made a total of more than 1300, over selling 196 notes, Shunli entered a total of 392, sold 567, The Guangdong gang Hengxing did not buy much, the bulls in September were Shunli Runchang Yuhongxing, each more than 1000, Wanxing Bingxing more than 2000, Hengxing Hengyu each more than 700, Fuchang 840 notes, Yifengyong Chunyanyong Chengfengyong each more than 600, Shengda Zhaofengchang each 525 notes, The bears are the most with Daxingyong, with 2000, Ruixing Tongfeng Hengfuyu Zhifengyong Yuanmaoyong are all above 1000, Qingfayong Hengchangyong each more than 600, Yuanfengyong empty 812 notes, a total of 18,942 notes,</p>

<h3 id="e232">This Month's Yarn and Cotton 交割 (Settlement) Summary <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>5,100 Bales of Yarn and 18,900 Loads of Cotton</p>
<p>The July yarn contract was auctioned on February 1st, with a price of 145 taels and 9 mace, equivalent to approximately 204 yuan in foreign currency. Subsequently, spring sales stagnated, external threats in North China intensified daily, credit became extremely tight, rural areas in the interior declined, purchasing power was greatly diminished, sales became sluggish, yarn inventories accumulated, and manufacturers faced difficulties and significant losses. To maintain the survival of the factories, a meeting of the trade was convened in mid-April to shorten working hours and reduce production, resolving to halt operations for two half-days each week. This caused a slight shock to sentiment, and the market showed a slight rebound, but sales remained poor and the market struggled to improve. Midway through the month, the United States implemented a policy of currency inflation, causing U.S. cotton prices to rise, which lent some support to the market. However, prices fluctuated around 190 yuan, and yarn inventories continued to grow. By the middle of this month, sellers had ample supplies for delivery, but there was a significant lack of buyers for the old cotton yarn offered. Market sentiment was weak again. Later, a certain manufacturer purchased 1,200 bales in preparation for delivery, providing some support. The final transaction price was 184 yuan and 8 jiao, 3 yuan and 2 jiao lower than the June price. The resulting price difference for the three days of 交割 (settlement) was 186 yuan, with a total 交割 (settlement) volume of 5,100 bales. However, only 200 bales of 20-count cotton yarn were actually delivered; the rest was settled by themselves. The broker numbers and bales of the delivering and receiving parties are listed below:</p>

<p>The July Zhengzhou cotton contract was auctioned on February 1st, with a price of 33 taels, equivalent to approximately 46 yuan and 1.2 jiao in foreign currency. Subsequently, due to the weakness of Indian cotton and the stagnation of yarn sales, sentiment softened, and the market trended downward. Furthermore, there was much talk about yarn factories reducing work hours due to the poor yarn market. The lowest price seen was 41 yuan and 7 or 8 jiao. However, the U.S. government implemented a currency inflation plan, and U.S. cotton prices rose daily, driving up the cotton market. Later, in mid-May, competition between Britain and Japan for cotton intensified. In retaliation, Japan refused to purchase Indian cotton and switched to buying Chinese cotton instead. As a result, Japanese merchants extensively scoured Shandong, Zhengzhou, Tianjin, and other places. Shanghai was greatly shaken. Speculators, in conjunction with foreign merchants, purchased in the futures market, and calls for a short squeeze were loud and clear. Buyers were ambitious, anticipating 交割 (settlement) prices as high as 52 yuan. By the middle of this month, the highest price seen was 49 yuan and 3 jiao. Unexpectedly, U.S. cotton prices plummeted, and factories had ample supplies for delivery. Moreover, many yarn factories were suspending or reducing work hours. In the final days, those who had taken long positions, fearing the negative sentiment, rushed to close out their positions, and the price fell back to 47 yuan and 9 jiao. In the final transaction, a certain speculator surnamed Wang alone received over 10,000 loads of cotton. The price was 48 yuan and 6 jiao. As a result, the remaining 18,900 loads of goods, including Lingdou cotton, 火機 cotton, and Shaanxi cotton, were all 交割 (settled). The broker numbers and amount of each side are as follows:</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Sources from over 30 houses, retail sales exist but are not smooth, wholesale purchases are already stagnant. Due to tighter controls by distributors, it has slightly stabilized. Market prices for various types of thick粳 (japonica) rice, thin秈 (indica) rice, and Duyang pointed rice have not changed, and overall changes are slightly weak. It is estimated that only two loads of Xitang thin稻 (paddy) rice from the Beichuan guild were shipped for wholesale, priced at 6 yuan and 9 jiao. New粳 (japonica) rice from the Xinchang factory continues to have price reductions due to increased arrivals, with an opening price of 7 yuan and 8 jiao.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Sources from over 10 houses from downstream rivers. Sales of white粳 (japonica) rice remain sluggish, and the market is soft and weak, down 1 jiao for medium-grade and poor quality. Thin粳 (japonica) rice is slightly inferior, early rice and Dujian pointed rice are down 1 jiao, and 羊尖 pointed rice is also weak, down about 1 jiao. 埠 客 pointed rice and Baiyuan rice are also down about 1 jiao. There is a continued source of Dongxin粳 (japonica) rice, with normal sales and a price reduction of 2 jiao.</p>
<p>(客秈 Rice) Sales remain active, but inventories are declining and are not being replenished. The Tianjin guild welcomes Hunan milled red rice, but due to a shortage of goods, only 25 packages were shipped, priced at 7 yuan and a half. The Yong guild shipped 180 packages of Jiangxi milled late rice, priced at 7 yuan and 5 fen. 350 packages of Hunan milled oil rice, priced at 7 yuan and 6 jiao 4 fen to 7 yuan and a half. 110 packages of rough red rice, priced at 6 yuan.

<h3 id="e236">Flour and Wheat Are Both Affected by Falling Foreign Wheat Prices <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>The wheat market is being pulled down by the falling prices of foreign wheat, with American wheat falling 1 yuan and 6 jiao and a half, and Canadian wheat falling 2 yuan and 2, 3 or 4 jiao. Coupled with the sluggish flour sales, the market naturally trends towards softness. However, profitable shortsellers are seizing the opportunity to cover their positions, so the market, while falling, is actually stable, with each month only falling 3 or 4 fen. This is the reason why. Until the afternoon opening, due to the shortsellers of brokers, they were again urgently covering their positions step by step. Interior customers are still unwilling to cut their losses, resulting in the market being buoyant instead, with fewer sellers. Each month rebounded by 2, 3 or 4 fen. However, this resurgence is only a fleeting glimmer, and the future is likely fraught with danger. As a result, August rose 2 fen, October remained down 1 fen, and the rest were unchanged. Currently, both cargo from customers and goods managed by brokers themselves arrive daily in the wheat market, with 江北貨 accounting for the majority.阜豐 has no appetite, and only 福新 is making slight arrangements. Therefore, the situation is deteriorating daily, and each grade has been cut short by 3 to 5 fen. 窰 wheat opens at 3 yuan and 7 jiao and 2 fen, Gaoyou wheat at 3 yuan and 6 jiao and 6 fen, second grade at 6 jiao and 3 fen, Zhenjiang wheat at 3 yuan and 5 jiao and a half, second grade at 5 jiao and 2 fen, Liuhe wheat at 3 yuan and 6 jiao and 3 fen, and Qingjiangpu wheat at 3 yuan and 6 jiao and 2 fen, totaling over 11,000 packages, reportedly managed by 福新.</p>
<p>After the flour market opened this year, there was a significant disturbance. Due to the fall in foreign wheat prices and the rumor that American wheat would be dumped in the East, the domestic flour sales are currently in a slump. The spread of this rumor has shaken the market. This month, the lowest price fell to 2 yuan and 2 jiao and 9 fen, August to 2 yuan and 3 jiao and 5 li, and September to 2 yuan and 3 jiao and a half, down 2, 3 or 4 fen from the previous day's closing price. After entering each transaction, due to major factories resisting the advance of this month, distant months were gradually sold short. The other factories also sold off smoothly, estimated to be over 500,000 packages. However, speculators from outside the industry seized the opportunity to cover their short positions, which was also very active. Therefore, the recent situation has rebounded by about 2 fen compared to the lowest point. However, sentiment for distant months is gradually softening due to the difficulty of seeing any improvement in the domestic sales market and the worry about the dumping of foreign wheat. As a result, compared to the previous day, it fell 1 fen and 2 li and a half, August fell 1 fen, September fell 1 fen and 7 li and a half, October fell 1 fen, November fell 1 fen, and December fell 1 fen and a half.</p>

<h3 id="e240">What is Our Future? <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>Recently, Japanese Minister of War Araki said in a speech somewhere: "Around 1936, the Yamato nation will face its most severe situation 丨I will fully prepare the people of our country with the spirit of Bushido to face this situation in the future." According to the Associated Press, Washington, 27th: "The U.S. Department of the Interior today paid the Army Department USD 6 million as part of the cost of improving national defense plans to build port defenses in the Panama Canal area and the Hawaiian Islands." It is heard that this is only part of the total national defense expenditure, and the entire amount is said to exceed USD 50 million. In addition, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan are also vigorously building warships at the same time to seize naval hegemony, and European countries are also using national defense as an excuse to expand their military preparations. If we recall the situation of the arms race between various countries before 1914, the world today is actually similar to the situation immediately before the European War, except that the area of conflict in the future will be in the Far East, not on the European continent. Under this severe situation, how should China prepare to cope with this unprecedented crisis? Based on our current situation, if we infer its future, it can only make people have a great deal of doubt and fear!</p>
<p>Today, any Chinese person should be deeply aware that China's future is our own future. If we have a little courage not to give up on ourselves, we must quickly plan the path of struggle and the strategies to cope with it. We must not think that the time in "1936" is still far away. We should know that the days of two or three years will come in an instant. Speaking realistically, if the Second World War really breaks out in "1936", then we will be able to prepare immediately, and I am afraid it will be too late, let alone prepare fundamentally? We imagine the inevitable tragic slaughter after the outbreak of the war, which will create an unprecedented new record in the history of killing people. If we immediately plan to prepare, then although there is a worry of being too late, it is always much better than being slaughtered on the spot. So, will our future be at the mercy of others, slaughtered, or will we have to fight a bloody path to continue to survive? This depends on our self-determination. Relying on苟安, hoping for luck, are all like dreaming!</p>

<h3 id="e242">Uncle's Sorrow <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>--- Zhang Yu</p>
<p>Because of the bankruptcy of the rural economy, I reluctantly abandoned my lovely hometown and came to the city to work like an animal to get a little reward to make a living. But the situation in my hometown often lingers in my mind.</p>
<p>"Uncle is back!" This kind of cry from my nephews and nieces is what I always hear when I step onto the corner of the yard every time I go home. At the same time, my mother leans on the door, showing a kind smile, watching her grandchildren scramble to take my bag. Because every time I go home, I always bring them some candy cane or toys to eat or play with. Even if I don't buy it, my brother will ask me to bring some for them. They compete with each other to take my bag, half to welcome me home, but half also to get more candy canes and toys.</p>
<p>However, this time when I went home, although there was no change in other situations, the uncle's voice in the mouths of my nephews and nieces seemed a little harsh, and the smile on my mother's face was a little unnatural, and there were a few more crystal tears in her eyes. It turned out that my brother had died of illness last winter! So when she saw me, she thought of my brother's death, and therefore she was deeply saddened.</p>
<p>Every time I go home, I always bring back my brother's letter, or he asks me to bring her things that my mother likes and delicious food for her to enjoy. But, now? Although I also bring a little, but because of the oppression of the economy, after all, there is not as much as my brother used to ask me to bring!</p>

<h3 id="e243">The Oriental Gambling City <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>--- Wang Mingxin</p>
<p>The Big Casino</p>
<p>At three o'clock in the night, Lao Wu, Xiao Wang and I went to a big casino to play. As soon as we entered the gate, our eyes lit up, and five hundred incandescent electric lights illuminated the entire flower garden. As soon as the car stopped, a gentlemanly receptionist ran over. When he saw us, he retreated, probably knowing that we no longer needed a "greeter."</p>
<p>After handing over our top hats and scarves to the waiter, he gave us three red gold watch pendants with two English floral letters on them. The first room we entered was a bank-like room, and the gilded railings and props made people's eyes feel uncomfortable. Because we didn't bring enough cash, we signed checks there. I exchanged a total of forty one-hundred-yuan chips. (For bets of less than one hundred yuan, cash should be used)</p>
<p>Walking through four or five rooms, mahjong, digging flowers, poker, pai gow, dice, shaking stands, everything was available. Of course, mahjong, digging flowers, and poker are too much trouble, so we just casually placed a few pai gow bets. Looking at the table, each pai entered and exited with more than 20,000 chips, with each bet averaging 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The most gamblers were in the dice and big roulette areas, and the number of bets placed there was also relatively small. Sometimes a small amount of cash could also be seen.</p>
<p>People who come here are indeed much more generous. They are very calm even when they earn one or two thousand, and they never show the joy of "the poor getting rich." Even if they lose 100,000 or 80,000, they dare to be calm and composed, without the slightest smile, and never look "vicious and evil" like in other casinos. This big casino covers an area of ​​about dozens of acres, with the flower garden accounting for most of it, and half of the four-story western-style building with ten floors and ten bottoms is empty. Only when you come to this casino can you see what is really called gambling, which is beyond the reach of other casinos; if you compare the Jai Alai court and the dog racing court with this place, it is even more ridiculous and simple.</p>
<p>Most of the gamblers are sea-dwelling gentry and children of wealthy gentry. Their extravagant demeanor and gorgeous clothes are probably unimaginable to the average person. If you eavesdrop on us calculating the gambling accounts, you will definitely think that what we are talking about may be the number of "paper marks." In fact, the amazing huge amount of ins and outs are regarded as very normal here.</p>
<p>Because the indoor air was not very good, we went outside for a walk. There were at least 500 vehicles lined up outside, but because the gamblers were scattered everywhere, it didn't feel crowded. A young lady dressed as a thousand gold handed over three cotton-headed French cigarettes. After lighting them, Xiao Wang casually gave her two ten-yuan bills. In addition, the price of three cups of coffee and tea, western desserts, fruit sundaes, and three towels was half a hundred yuan. In fact, these are all freely available to customers without taking a penny, and what you pay is just the money for the rouge and powder on those jade hands.</p>
<p>The room was full of the scent of Parisian perfume, too strong. For people who are not used to it, it can simply cause a headache. The futuristic props (which did not exist in the 181 era) made the average gambler feel like they were on a stage or screen, and the waiter's eagerness made us feel like "Ford Kings." After gambling for a long time, I was really a little bored, so I forcibly pulled Lao Wu and Xiao Wang out.</p>
<p>When we returned to the place where we exchanged chips, they looked at my chips and said, "9,500 cash!" Really, they had a lot of cash, and amounts less than 10,000 were not paid by check. I was already tired and only placed a few bets. I won some and lost some, and I didn't know when I exchanged five one-thousand-yuan tokens. But Xiao Wang and Lao Wu were unlucky that day and each lost several thousand yuan.</p>
<p>We took back our hats and scarves, and paid 20 yuan in small accounts before walking out inexplicably. At this time, the gambling</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>The gamblers have already left one-third, and there are two new "Lincoln cars" waiting at the door besides my car, with the doors open. Xiao Wang and Lao Wu each got into one. I knew that this was specially used by the big casino to send off guests, and nominally it was free, but I was afraid that each of them would have to spend a small sum on a banquet.</p>
<p>My car was halfway there, and the customs bell was already ringing at eight o'clock. So I asked the driver to take me directly to the office, because there was nothing important waiting for me to deal with there, and there was comfortable bedding prepared for me there.</p>
<p>The driver told me very happily that it was more than a night's salary. I smiled, and he said, "The people in the room said, please tell your master to come often in the future! I will tell you!"</p>
<h3 id="e244">Dancing Hall: Forest of Legs and Meat <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Moyun</p>
<p>A dance hostess is the soul of a dancing hall. Truly, if a dancing hall doesn't have a few dance hostesses who can get by, it's better to close down shop sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>In order to increase their sexual appeal, they sometimes don't hesitate to sacrifice their modesty and don't even wear stockings, exposing their thighs all the way up (their shorts are so short they only cover their private parts). Oh, those thighs! I don't know how many men have drowned in them! But even if every young man on the entire planet died out completely, they probably wouldn't bat an eye, and would immediately turn around and attack those dying old men. They only recognize shiny silver dollars! Other than that, their eyes are covered with tinted glass...</p>
<p>Some of them already have husbands, some already have "trailers" (a nickname for lovers, meaning "concubines"), and even more have lost their freedom like prostitutes. So, those "suckers" freely order champagne and give away dance tickets, which to them are just unexpected windfalls. They once said sweet words, feigned shyness or anger, using extremely seductive glances, and even sacrificing a kiss, but as soon as they leave you, they'll go and treat someone else like that. To say something disappointing, all the "sucker money" they get from you is given to their husbands or "trailers." What's more, what will make you feel like "Am I being treated like a fool?" is that when they go home at dawn, they've already forgotten about you, and are instead snuggling their snow-white bodies in the arms of their husbands or "trailers," pursuing playful love and sexual revelry...</p>
<p>However, these poor dance hostesses, dancing with customers from nine o'clock every night until three or four in the morning, their legs and feet are made of flesh and blood, not iron.  They have tired legs, aching legs, and they go home with aching legs. Why do those young masters who treat dance hostesses as playthings only know how to buy smiles with money, and don't know how to soothe their pain?</p>
<p>X X X X X</p>
<p>But if a dancing hall relies solely on a few dance tickets to survive, the dancing hall owner's wife will definitely not be few in number; otherwise, if there's only one wife, it won't be enough to cover the losses. Of course, dance hostesses are the soul of a dancing hall; even a dance customer who goes to a dancing hall to dance has to do some investigation before going to a dancing hall that he thinks has the most beautiful dance hostesses. However, although the owner hopes that all his dance hostesses are as beautiful as heavenly goddesses, he doesn't want to earn money solely from a few dance tickets, because for every hundred dollars of dance tickets sold, he only gets fifty dollars in hand; and he still has to provide food and drink for the dance hostesses, and he has to spend money to print the dance tickets. What he hopes for is that more wine is sold, and he doesn't mind selling more tea, coffee, cocoa, soda, and elaborate white dishes, etc. For example, a bottle of brandy costs ten dollars, but sold cup by cup, it can sell for at least forty dollars; coffee, tea, cocoa, and soda cost five cents per cup or bottle. Look, drinking a cup of tea or a bottle of soda for five cents, even the emperor who considers himself the only one worthy doesn't drink anything better? (If you treat a dance hostess to a cocktail, to be honest, it's not a glass of wine, but a glass of cold tea - four-fifths is tea, and only one-fifth is wine - and the price is two cents more; these two cents are given to the dance hostess, perhaps as a bonus.)</p>
<p>So the Bar (wine and soda, etc. belong to the Bar) and the Kitchen (tea, coffee, elaborate white dishes, etc. belong to the Kitchen) are the two cash cows of a dancing hall. X X X X X</p>
<p>In addition to the monthly rent, which is a major expense, the musicians' salaries are also considerable. The salaries of a band of American musicians are at least three thousand dollars per month; a band of Filipino musicians also gets about two thousand dollars; even the cheapest Russian musicians can't do without a thousand dollars per band. Paid every half month, if there's no money when the time comes, they'll use force. If you often treat them to champagne, or give them an extra bottle of beer to drink, they can get the customers to spend more money - shortening the time for playing music and resting, while increasing the number of times they play music, so the sales of dance tickets will be better.</p>
<p>As for the European servants, they are very ruthless. "Red eyes, green eyebrows," if you're not careful, they'll rip you off while you're dazed by wine and women.</p>
<p>Other things, such as cigarettes and candies, etc., are priced one or two times higher than outside, which is already known to everyone, and I don't need to repeat it. As for one dollar only being worth ten cents (small silver coins), that's an open secret, but only the rich go to dancing halls, and they certainly won't haggle over one or two cents; this is considered a bargain for the accountant.</p>
<p>X X X X X</p>
<p>In short, a dancing hall is a book with a beautifully decorated cover, but if you open its table of contents, the entire content it contains is just: bitter wine, skulls, walking corpses, living dead, a den of demons, sorrow and joy, a demonic dance, the burial of youth... A cozy nest? A dark shop.</p>
<p>White knives go in, red knives come out, intimidation, deception, the law of the jungle, the crossroads of life and death, the opposition of rich and poor, the sale of flesh, the labor of legs, the pouring of music, the stimulation of tobacco and alcohol, loving beauty but not the country... These, these, are interwoven into a dancing hall.</p>

<h3 id="e245">I Need Work and Bread <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Meiwei</p>
<p>The Buddhist scriptures say: "If there is no birth, then there is no death," then my flesh and blood are being wasted in struggling for this miserable "life"! When I see withered and frightening faces, my heart can't help but cry out! From the fluttering snowflakes to the scorching sun, these months of unemployment are like being kicked into a bottomless abyss, like being thrown into a trap where you can't live or die. My distraught mind makes me like a homeless dog! Unable to go up to heaven, unable to go down to earth, a homeless dog lost in the east, west, south, and north!</p>
<p>The embarrassing situation of a homeless, wandering person like me when they become unemployed is probably something that successful people can't even imagine! Especially in this cold and fickle world, without money or power, people like me who are lonely are annoying enough to relatives and friends when they accidentally see them, let alone inquire about them. I remember Lu Xun said, "Those who have fallen from a well-off family into poverty, those who have come through this journey have seen through the true face of the world." How true are these words about the ways of the world! Truly, I am a person who has tasted all the cold shoulders on the road of life!</p>
<p>The practical problem, "life," still oppresses me very seriously, but what else can this lost person do besides hold a wounded and painful heart and shake their brain with disappointment all day long! Whenever I wake up in the middle of the night, the horror of unemployment makes me ask myself in shock: "If this kind of life continues..." Alas! This stumps me! These six months, hiding in a small attic less than five feet wide, have been as blurry as a dream, and I don't even know how I got through them. Sometimes I unconsciously wander aimlessly on the road. In this city with alternating red and green lights, how desolate and bewildered is the heart of a lonely, unemployed person when they see those people with fat heads and big faces, flying with excitement? Ah! Who would have thought that the sea of life would be so uneven? I look up at the sky and down at the earth, and my mind is blank!</p>
<p>At this time, I think of Shelley wandering in a foreign land and Qu Yuan with grief filling his chest, wandering by the Luo River and eventually sinking into the vast waves. I think of how they could still write brilliant elegies! But what about me? ... These chaotic thoughts flood my mind; two weak legs accompany a thin shadow, and when I return to the dormitory entrance, I hear the landlady and her daughter laughing and talking. Suddenly, it hangs heavy in the heart of a wanderer who has fallen to the ends of the earth! It's like a big stone, instantly becoming heavy!</p>
<p>Ten years ago, I had already been driven by hunger and cold to leave my hometown and embark on the road of life. Although I don't have a special skill, I have never received any help in the past ten years. I have always found my own bread and struggled on the road of fierce survival competition. In the past, I have worked as a teacher in primary and secondary schools, a tutor, and other similar jobs. Now I sincerely want to sell my labor. If readers of this newspaper have a place where I can be of use, no matter how big or small the task, I am willing to serve as a maid. My request dares not be great. Although I have lived for thirty-two years, I still do not have a family or other places that I have to bear. I only need to be able to maintain my own minimum standard of living. Correspondence can be forwarded through this publication.</p>
<h3 id="e246">Mysterious Building <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Song Chuping</p>
<p>General Assembly</p>
<p>This is the XX Senior Club of the Great Republic of China. Although it is located on XX Road, a road built across the border in the suburbs of Shanghai, the location is very quiet. Every night from 9:00 PM to 3:00 or 4:00 AM, club members can drive their cars at will without the trouble of running over people.</p>
<p>In this towering three-dimensional building of the club, no one knows how many rooms there are, except for the superintendent of the house and the engineer who made the blueprints. Each floor and each room has very ingenious and secret facilities, so that people can discuss important matters. There are also card rooms, smoking rooms, mahjong, poker, kowtow, chess sets, music... Each part has extremely valuable and precious items, and various different beautifying decorations. The electric lights emit a gentle and charming glow, reflecting the faces of adult gentlemen with their joys, sorrows, angers, and pleasures, fat and thin, yellow and white. The waiters carefully and attentively listen to and accept the commands and instructions of anyone. The thick, soft carpet heavily bears the trampling and pounding of leather shoes and canes. The exquisitely embroidered silk cushions often receive large, dignified buttocks and the ash of cigar licks. When the silk flower tablecloth is stained with coffee, tea, or colored iced drink water stains, the waiters are very accustomed to immediately replacing it with another clean tablecloth. Air-conditioning pipes and water tinges replace unregulated electric fans or electric stoves, and unsuitable excessively cold or excessively hot weather can be arbitrarily controlled in winter and summer. Some of the cards are like jade and some are like opaque crystal, with emerald green or pink tough backs, and after rubbing against the table for several hours, the waiters have at least two or three hundred dollars of income, not to mention that the four warriors have tens of thousands of dollars of winnings and losses. Those who have had enough of the addiction, leisurely holding rolls of banknotes of fifty dollars or more, or the club's special chips, often stand behind the mahjong game to observe the situation and place bets...</p>
<p>Yes, everything seems leisurely and extravagant.</p>
<p>However, the deliberation of national economic, political, and other important issues is often resolved here after cards and wine! Those who patronize this place are at least high officials and dignitaries or wealthy businessmen who can manipulate part of the power of society. In short, they are people of value! Their conversations and actions can maintain the safety of the entire society; they come here not hoping to enjoy any personal pleasure, but in addition to sitting, playing, eating, and drinking, there are many problems related to the lives of millions of people that need to be discussed and negotiated here!</p>
<p>In the dense shade of the trees, this six-story Western-style building built in 1932 is lying down. Those who have never been inside certainly do not know its wealth and greatness. It is already a very difficult thing to penetrate the tall glass windows with various window curtains in all seasons and see the ceiling inside. Who can imagine everything inside? And the noisy sounds of joy, card games, music, and conversations inside, of course, cannot penetrate outside. On the road with martial law, people only see an exhibition of rows of new cars and this mysterious building when passing by.</p>

<p>— Ji Xixi</p>
<p>Grand Theater</p>
<p>XXX Road, such a long XXX Road! The July sun is strangely fierce, and XXX Road is soft. These green, oily leaves shade the sidewalks; there are no girls strolling, no Pekingese running, it's strangely desolate. But, this place is noisy again!</p>
<p>It's across from XX Hall, under a great three-dimensional building, one after another, groups of "Citroens," "Dodges," "Lincolns," "......," are roaring.</p>
<p>Ah! The first grand theater in X City.</p>
<p>Today! I'm going to take the price I got from selling my blood, step into this crystallization of the public's blood and sweat, and enjoy the three million dollars worth of equipment.</p>
<p>Under the construction of marble, stepping on the ground of mica stone, how smooth! I'm holding this surprised heart, stepping with timid steps, slipping and slipping, slipping to the fountain, next to which are laid out many, many flowers and plants, and the water spraying out: crimson, dark green, azure, blue-green, ...... are interlaced.</p>
<p>It's still early, the doors inside haven't opened yet, but people are already crowded. Men, women; some are sitting on elastic sofas, some are pacing on the smooth mica stone: waiting, admiring the yellow patterned house.</p>
<p>Ah! These women of July, seductive women, are draped in these thin, cicada-wing-like "imported goods," and in the reflection of this yellow house, they look extraordinarily charming and extraordinarily seductive.</p>
<p>As the curtain opens, they rush in one after another, and the cold air fills my body. I'm dazed, I suspect I'm in the icebergs of the Arctic!</p>
<p>Having chosen a seat, looking back, the seats around me are full. Looking at the stage in front, under the shining crystal lights, the lake-green curtain is fluttering, and faint music is drifting out from here. On the patterned roof, the electric lights are mysteriously hidden inside. I feel the cold air lightly floating all over my body, how cool, how comfortable!</p>
<p>The whole theater is plunged into darkness, and all I can recognize clearly are John Barrymore and Dana Wynham on the screen.</p>
<p>But what about the owner who created this house? He's still creating under the scorching sun, never able to run inside again, under the supervision of the servants.</p>

<h3 id="e250">The Surrealism of "Scenery Problems in Chinese Films" <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Xingzhi</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Miwu's "Scenery Problems in Chinese Films," it aroused many of my thoughts. The "first is the non-reality of the scenery" and "the second is the inability to unify the plot" proposed by Mr. Miwu are the biggest defects in Chinese film scenery at present.</p>
<p>But why are there these defects? According to my experience in the studio: (1) it is because the scenery designer lacks the experience of real life, and (2) it is because of the lack of communication between the director and the scenery designer.</p>
<p>In the studio, the director sometimes considers that a certain scene is beautiful and the cost is too expensive, and it seems a pity to shoot so few shots, so he adds some meaningless shots and plots. Conversely, because the scenery is not beautiful, the director thinks it will affect the ugliness of the picture, so he arbitrarily reduces the necessary performances and shots. In this way, because of the different scenery of the scenery designer, the director's original plan is often changed.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the scenery designer lacks the experience of real life and the knowledge of architectural decoration. Apart from buying some reference books from the bookstore and moving the foreign interior decoration and furnishings into Chinese films as a whole, he never considers the composition of Chinese real life. As a result, as Mr. Miwu said, "a rich man's home" is decorated with "extravagant and luxurious devices," and at the same time, "a salary-class home" is also "such a novel set."</p>
<p>Therefore, the scenery designer's scenery in the film not only affects the entire plot, but sometimes simply controls the director's thinking and the photographer's plan. Often the director changes the fixed directing plan because of the different scenery. Moreover, because of the richness and simplicity of the scenery, the unified mood of the play is broken. In this way, because of the surrealization of the scenery (partially), the entire plot (wholly) is affected by the surrealization.</p>
<p>In the studio, what is the situation of Chinese directors and scenery designers: On the first night, the director greets the scenery designer and says, "Tomorrow I want a good-looking coffee shop." However, because of time constraints, and even more because he does not understand the plot, the scenery designer casually chooses a picture from the book or writes a picture himself and gives it to the carpenter. The next day, the director sees the quality of the scenery and then makes plans. In this way, the director also becomes surreal, and then the entire film mechanism becomes surreal.</p>
<p>Here, in order to avoid these shortcomings, we require that the installation of film scenery is best designed by the director himself. If the director is not good at drawing and designing, he must at least give the scenery designer a general outline or model. At the same time, the scenery designer must also know the plot, characters, performances, and all the actions in the play; during shooting, the director and the photographer must constantly communicate in order to achieve a unified result. At least we still require that each director must have basic knowledge of drawing, architecture, and decorative arts.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e251">Review of "Westward Passage" <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>丨Dahua Ying丨</p>
<p>After watching this film, I think many people will be saddened by this plot. Especially the intellectuals of the middle class, perhaps even more will admit the literary success of this film. In fact, this is a novel adaptation. I personally know very little about the original author, but judging from the story of this film, it is not necessarily a naturalistic work. At the same time, the reason why the original author wants to use writers as the object of depiction may be that this kind of subject matter can better obtain his own deep experience. Writers are rich in emotions, unable to be rational in the face of events and prone to emotional actions, which should be the most common phenomenon of inferiority. In addition, when they are poor, the whip of life beats them, so troubled moods often cause violent actions. Moreover, the enjoyment of material things cannot give his wife even a low degree of satisfaction, so it is reasonable for poor couples to eventually break up. However, letting his wife take his daughter to remarry someone else is still a painful hidden pain. Under such circumstances, they meet again in a foreign land, the daughter calls her father, and the wife thinks of the former love, what is the feeling! Although they finally reconcile, this kind of hardship ultimately makes people feel deep sadness, especially the Story does not deviate from the economic foundation, which is a more correct understanding.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the emotion of this film is indeed very successful. In particular, the director describes it very delicately, bit by bit, all are the expression of emotion. Especially after they reconciled, they went to the hotel where they had had extreme love, and quarreled again over trivial matters, and the wife decided to leave again, but stopped because she saw her daughter's toys; this simple technique is really rare. As for accidentally damaging her husband's manuscript and making him angry immediately, this is the original author's most profound brushstroke, and it is also the director's proud technique. However, on the whole, it is inevitably a bit dull, but if it is to maintain the mood of the original work, there is no way to do it. Moreover, it may still be very suitable for audiences with a little literary interest.</p>
<p>We don't know much about this director, Mr. Robert Milton, but even in this work alone, we cannot ignore the depth of his artistic cultivation. He not only has appropriate use of editing and editing, but also the configuration of music is very delicate, such as the final playing of Piana.</p>
<p>It is probably very suitable for Ann Harding to play the role of a virtuous wife, just like her previous roles of the same personality have not failed. Laurence Oliver's writer seems insufficient. Zasu Pitts is also very good here.</p>
<p>However, this film has a biggest shortcoming, which is the failure of sound recording. This loss is somewhat regrettable.</p>
<h3 id="e252">"Film Critic Personnel" in the Morning News Daily Film Section <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>The Morning News Daily Film, which has always condescended to offer "advice" or "contributions" to the Shanghai News film supplement, published a piece of "Film Critic Personnel" news yesterday. It wrote, "It is said that film critic Ling Hejun will be the editor of the Shanghai News film supplement. Last night at 10 o'clock, he gathered many film critics on Bubbling Well Road to discuss the organization of a film critic group. The details and results are unknown." We don't know where this news came from. The Daily Film has always been very keen to hear about the "personnel" of our newspaper; however, sometimes it makes jokes. For example, because it attacked A too fiercely, it deliberately added a couple of sentences praising B, when in fact A and B are the same person. The editor of this supplement has never exposed these things, letting them guess. Now this piece of "personnel" news is probably due to inaccurate measurement. As for whether there are other malicious intentions, as Ling Hejun himself suspects, I can't control much. Outsiders fabricating news to hurt feelings will certainly not be effective. As for the words "Bu Min" (Unskilled) signed by the current editor of this supplement, it is also a fictitious pen name. If Ling Hejun becomes the editor of the Shanghai News film supplement in the future, I will definitely offer him the old sign of "Bu Min." At that time, please, gentlemen of the "Daily Film," inquire clearly whether this "Bu Min" is the same "Bu Min," or whether this "Bu Min" is no longer the same "Bu Min." (Bu Min)</p>

<p>— Wan Shi</p>
<p>Another martial arts film.</p>
<p>However, I always find it strange that, with the almost complete ban on domestic martial arts films in China, the United States still sends in this type of film in large quantities. Then it is no problem that this kind of work that caters to low-level interests can still be quite popular in China, otherwise why would it come in an endless stream? Perhaps foreign goods are much better than domestic products after all, and they do not harm</p>
<p>Chinese society; the reason why it is not banned lies in this.</p>
<p>However, in terms of this film, its content is not necessarily in line with the above conditions. Obviously, it is a work modeled after the "Tales of Jianghu Knights" and other works. A hero, in order to avenge the murder of his father, breaks out of prison, impersonates an official, abuses his power for personal gain, and single-handedly fights. At the same time, the hero must be amorous, and therefore holds a beauty in his arms. In the end, the father's revenge is avenged, the hero also submits to the law, and the good things are harmonized. Is there any educational significance in this? Is this a typical character? However, linking "revenge" and "submitting to the law" is very much in line with modern rules, so killing officials and impersonating officials does not make those in power frown.</p>
<p>I think it is not necessary to estimate the artistic value of this kind of film. Regardless of how sophisticated the film company's machinery is, regardless of how skilled the authors are, is it not a waste of money and energy to put a gorgeous coat on such a boring story? What's more, you can't turn a straw man into a living thing. Even if it looks like a person, it is still just scaring birds and beasts.</p>
<p>To put it more clearly, the performance techniques of this film are, in every respect, rudimentary, old-fashioned, vulgar, and superficial. Riding, running, escaping, chasing, mutually reflecting again and again, the result is winning vulgar applause and empty tension. If this is in line with the "time and space" theory in film theory, then what a ridiculous thing film will be! To put it bluntly, if we continue to work hard like this, film art will be going backwards and returning to the past.</p>
<p>Many people say that movies are not textbooks but purely entertainment. I don't want to explain whether this statement can be established here, but this kind of film cannot give us full entertainment, can it? I wonder if the readers who have seen this film feel the same way?</p>
<h3 id="e254">Recent State of American Theaters <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— He Zui</p>
<p>In recent years, the business that can truly express the tendencies of American society is the abnormal development of urban entertainment facilities.</p>
<p>Since the end of the 19th century, when the entire economic organization of the United States leaned towards mechanical production, the working hours of the people have been shortening day by day, and people generally feel idle and their lives become monotonous; then, to receive enjoyment by the best method is the most appropriate, someone once advocated this, and hoped that this enjoyment must be popularized to the working masses. Sure enough, in the last twenty years, this ideal has gradually turned into a reality. The expansion of the film industry is a good example. According to a public survey in the United States, in January 1932, there were a total of 22,731 publicly operating movie theaters in the United States (excluding territories), which could accommodate 11.3 million viewers. If calculated at three shows a day, then 33.9 million people would visit theaters every day.</p>
<p>According to the statistics of 1931, the weekly audience also exceeded 100 million people, and the total amount of ticket sales was 150 million gold dollars.</p>
<p>As for the exact amount of investment in the film industry, although there are no accurate statistics, it must be around 200 million yuan. The amazing development of the American film industry can greatly express its modernized color.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the United States these days, almost everything is in a recession. However, the theaters in New York are still so easy to attract people. Thinking about this, one can imagine it.</p>
<h3 id="e255">Pilgrimage to Film Studios in Europe and America (11) <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>

<p>Next to the Leixunda Film Studio is the distribution department of the Swiss Film Company. Many Swedish theaters are affiliated with it. One of the largest theaters has extremely attentive service. If movie fans in Stockholm want to book seats in that theater, they only need to pick up the phone and say "SFTickets" to talk to the theater's telephone operator. Not only can they book seats, but they can also</p>

<p>(14) New Babylon City (Germany) Ncudabelsberg</p>
<p>丨Wufa Company Film Studio near Berlin丨</p>
<p>Among all the film studios in Europe, the Wufa City is the most complete and modern. It is located in New Babylon City near Berlin. It has fourteen separate sound stages and forty-two buildings for film production. But in 1912, there was only a small glass house there, used as a film studio, just to avoid the wind and rain. It was not until April 1929 that the new Wufa City was rebuilt. The circulation of air inside and outside the studio uses scientific methods. No matter how thunderous the sound is outside, it will not be transmitted to the eardrums of the staff in the studio.</p>
<p>The Wufa City factory uses 100,000 cubic yards of stacked wood and bamboo cloth, 40,000 cubic yards of paving boards, 600,000 feet of planks and moldings, 300 tons of plaster, 6,000 square feet of glass, and 1 million kilowatts of electricity every year. Surrounding the film studio are rows of modern dressing rooms, bathrooms, and lounges. There are also offices and dormitories for the 500 film studio partners. They produce 16 million feet of film every year.</p>
<p>In terms of machinery, there is nothing to criticize. Even in terms of human work, I am afraid that no film studio can match its spirit of cooperation. In a restaurant in the film studio, you will see electricians and temporary actresses sitting together for dinner, carpenters drinking coffee with cooks, and stars often discussing the difficulties in the film with the director there. They employ 800 workers, and everyone is very harmonious and cooperative. This is indeed a special strength of Wufa City. (The End)</p>
