<h3>英國袒日顯著國聯報告難期公正</h3>
<p>僞滿組織倘竟容許承認</p>
<p>我國唯有出於退盟一途</p>
<p>草報告完成二讀建議部分未涉及</p>
<p>結論十二條大部採用李頓報告書</p>
<p>（南京）九國起草之報告書前三章已告竣、其建議部份亦即可草竣、聞因英國袒日之結果、於關係重大之不承認僞組織一節、决不予規定、此不但與我國方針相反、且違背去年三月十一日之國聯决議案、政府對此已决意拒絶、且有有力方面主張如國聯採納此種報告、實暴露不能主持正義公直之面目、我旣無所期求、將斷然退出國聯云、（一日中央社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）九人小組委員會尙未提議「滿洲國」承認問題、但明日（星期三）討論建議問題時、或將提議及此、然亦不過簡略討論而已、因知十九特委會對於此事須發訓令致小組會也、十九特委會未必能於本週杪以前集會、因國聯行政院及軍縮會主幹部等皆將於本週内開會之故、（三十一日路透社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）十九國委員會任命之起草委員會、本日雖開會甚久、然準備提交國聯非常大會之報告書、其第一部分尙未完全脫稿、起草委員會人數旣多起草工作又極煩瑣、而委員人人皆欲參加、無論在内容上或形式上、時時有人提出新修正案、故該會任務甚感困難、出席該會之某要人對本社記者云、此項報告書日後脫稿時、恐難表示明確之見解、一如輿論之所期望也、起草委員會明晨重行開會、報告書最重要之一章、即包含建議之一部分、目下尙未開始討論、（三十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>完成草報告二讀</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）據今夜可恃消息、九人小組委員會已完成草報告之二讀、所有各點、包括排貨與自衛等難題在内、已完　議妥、小組會今日午後集議三小時半、初聞稍有進步、繼知工作殆皆完成、草報告書逐條皆加以詳細之研究、小組會决定明日即星期三日復行集議、以考慮南愛自由邦代表萊斯所提出之草議、及其他次要詳則、並將開始研究建議問題、小組會所議定者、當然須交十九特委會確認之、並　交國聯大會批准之、故現所擬就之草案、將來尙有修改之餘地、就九人小組會而言、彼等責備　貨、而亦不承認日本所提出之自衛主義、聞小組會今夜業已議妥各節如下、</p>
<h3>草案首三段内容</h3>
<p>首爲序言　長約六行、報告國聯工作移轉於國聯盟約第十五條第四節下之事由　報告書本文之第一段頗爲錯綜、内含李頓報告書之首八章、附以領事報告書、及時局事態發展截至今日之經過情形、第二段言一九三一年九月瀋陽事變起中日爭議之歷史　其中穿挿關於東三省之參考資料、意在使讀者有正當之了解第三段載結論十二條、大都採自李頓報告書、㈠說明東三省與中國之關係、及東三省與日本之關係、㈡確認東三省爲中國之一部、但在事實上享有自治地位、㈢言及近年來東三省中國人口之大增㈣說明日本在東三省亦有權利、如租借地及南滿鐵路是、並謂日本之特殊地位、在中國民族主義發展時、勢必造成緊張事態、㈤確認中國在過渡狀態中需要外助、以便建設成功、㈥言及排貨、謂排貨乃激怒的行動、爲中日間緊張之一原因、但在九一八事變後排貨、乃反對軍事行動之報復性質、㈦聲明雙方不接受公斷之機會、㈧言及自衛之困難問題、謂九一八夜之日人行動、不能認爲合法日衛之性質、無論如何、自衛之說、不能使國家免除國際盟約第十二條下之義務、中國亦可以自衛爲言、但中國始終遵守國聯盟約之範圍、觀於此節、草報告書援引李頓報告書所稱日人行動並非合法自衛一語、㈨聲明滿洲之獨立、並非自然産生之運動、並謂日人軍事活動中頗多政治成分、㈩說明巨幅土地確爲中國所有毫無疑義者、已被强奪而與中國分離、㈩㈠說明日本在李頓報告書繕成以後承認「滿洲國」㈩㈡說明雖九一八事變以前之時局、雙方皆負責任、但九一八以後所發生之事件、必不可歸罪中國、（三十一日路透社電）</p>
<h3>建議部分未討論</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）今日九人小組委員會之一小時會議、已將草報告書首三節之處理工作、告一結束、小組會未曾討論建議、將此問題留交十九特委會下届會議辦理、大約特委會可於星期五日集議、上組會今晨殊少必要工作、因數日前所提出之修正文草稿、其要旨已載入昨日草稿中、結論文字已切實定稿、即可付印、而成具體之草案、但第一第二兩叚雖就九人小組會而言、對已完成、但十九特委會集議時、或將與以最後之修改也、日内瓦居民患流行感冒病者占百分之二十、國聯秘書處政治股要員維奇氏亦染此症、未能辦公、渠爲熟悉此案之專家、以致報告書之完成爲之延緩、故報告書之首兩叚載有此案之歷史事件者、將以未經修飾之形式提交十九特委會、</p>
<h3>南愛修正被擯棄</h3>
<p>南愛代表萊斯德所提出之修正文、採用無多、因其中有若干條已包括於報告書中、其餘若干條則被擯棄不用、首兩叚之文　問題、不致發生重大爭論、因此文字純爲叙述性質也、因維奇氏之病、十九特委會能否於星期五日或星期六日開會、現尙不能無疑、但衆料特委會不妨星期五日討論建議問題、而於星期六日再討論全部報告書、今結論問題已得全體一致之同意、此乃進行之一重要步驟、惟最大之衝突點當然集中於建議、其尤甚者、爲「滿洲國」問題、此誠國聯洽事手腕之絶大事業也、</p>
<h3>大國向小國壓迫</h3>
<p>各小國之目前趨向、仍極力主張切實聲明不承認「滿洲國、」德代表之態度、亦顯然趨向於此方面、不過德人未公然承認之耳、小國之意見如此、而大國則願以更合外交之手叚處理此問題、以意度之、此事當可獲一折中方案、因各方面皆以爲不能有承認問題也、此舉無異申斥日本承認「滿洲國」之行爲、縱詞意隠而不顯、然日政府能接受與否、猶未可知也、日内瓦一般意見預料日政府必可表示温和態度、而不欲對於此種措詞稳健之不同意作暴烈之反動、致與國聯决裂也（一日）</p>
<h3>英駐日大使訪日外相内田</h3>
<p>（東京）英使林德萊今日下午五時往訪内田外長、詢問日外部對國聯之對策、内田外長除將訓令松岡代表大綱手交英使托其代轉英外長外、並表示如下意見、謂關於否認僞組織獨立問題、最好希望國聯能再讓步、否則所謂和協手段當無從施展、至於援用便章第十五條第四項、日政府預備靜候其報告内容、再定進退之策、不過該勸告内容於日本再不能接受者、日政府當毫不躊躇堅决退出國聯云、（一日華聯社電）</p>
<h3>英日秘密諒解</h3>
<p>雙方迄無否認表示</p>
<p>（南京）上月初本社據美國方面來源、發表英日秘密諒解消息、駐京英領館最近致函質問來源、經本社函覆於叙述來源之次、復聲明如英領館能正式否認該項密約、本社當樂於發表遲至今日終未覆函否認、即英政府亦未加以否認、而日本電通社日内瓦特派員於一月二十九日電中、亦有英外相必實踐如日本撤兵上海、英國關於滿洲問題將採更友好的態度之一語、足見英日密約說、確非無根、而十年來中英之親善友誼、將受極大之影響云、（一日中央社電）</p>
<h3>日政府訓電松岡内容</h3>
<p>反對僞組織之否認</p>
<p>堅持中日直接交涉</p>
<p>（東京）日内閣旣開緊急會議、外相内田復進覲日皇、日政府乃於今日發電致日内瓦代表團、據負責方面消息、日政府電諭其代表團、必須應用對於調解之最後努力、但同時必須堅持删除或修改理由說明書第九節關於承認「滿洲國」之文字、並堅持調解委員會職權須以依照日本所抱關於中日直接談判之已定政策爲限、日政府又諭令其代表、如調解失敗、不必反對盟約第十五條第四節之適用、但須注視依據第四節而擬定之建議文、聞日政府將先研究建議過於强硬、則日本非退出國聯、即仿德國在軍縮會之興動、撤回其日凡瓦代表團、（一日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）日内閣於取得四園寺及其他元老對於政府對國聯政策之諒解後、今晨舉行緊急會議、閣員全體出席、外相内田聲稱、西園寺極力贊成政府政策、内閣旋討論并决定致日内瓦代表之最後訓令、外相後以訓令呈日皇審定、然行於五時交電局拍發、内田返外務省時語新聞記者、政府已經過發出最後訓令之各種必要手續、日本態度旣未减弱、亦未加强、日本以其已定政策向前進行、無論環境如何、政策决不改變、但渠甚願續得國際之調解合作云、（一日路透電）</p>
<h3>齋藤將親訪西園寺</h3>
<p>（東京）日元老西園寺昨日會見内田外長後、因日陸軍主張蠻幹到底、對日本前途特抱憂慮、今日特派其專屬秘書原田男爵入京訪齋藤首相、傳西園寺對外交政策之主張、並聞政府之眞意、日政府在今日中午緊急内閣會議席上、將審愼討議元老西園寺之意見、閣議后齋藤首相將親往興津訪元老西園寺、商議對付國聯策略、（一日華聯電）</p>
<h3>準備起草反對宣言</h3>
<p>（南京）外務當局於適用盟約第十五條置、若國聯作成勸告報告書付大會票决時、確定㈠該爲僅係勸告而非命令、則一應置諸、如其内容係難能允諾時、由松岡全權於大會席上爲反對宣言、而此拒絶當然有法律的根據、㈡對於報告書根據第十五條第五項之權利提出陳述書、逐一反駁、闡明日本之立塲等二途、故基此方針、着手起草該反對宣言案陳述書案、（一日電通社電）</p>
<h3>日本不斷增兵</h3>
<p>顔代表向國聯報告</p>
<p>（日内瓦）中代表團今夜以重要文件一件送交國聯秘書處、並分發各界、據謂日本第八第十第十四師團自一月三十日起分乘火車二十四列、經斧山漢城前往東三省、準備進攻𤍠河、（三十一日路透電）</p>
<h3>僞美顧問强奸東北民意</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯秘書處今日發表「滿洲國」外交部顧問美人李氏（上海遠東時報主筆）之來函一通、函後附文件五百八十六頁、據謂皆係表示滿洲民意之文件、其中有宣言抗議及請願書等件據聞係「滿洲國」各商會及政治敎育等機關所發者、李氏來函謂當李頓調查團在滿調查時、許多人民因事極然險、不敢表示眞正决思、但新政府今已穏固其權力、减輕捐稅·平準幣價·肅清匪患·並免除人民極重担負故人民現甚滿意、不欲再歸張學良管轄、致因公然表示政見而受酷刑云、（一日路透電）</p>
<h3>羅外長發表重要談話</h3>
<p>=國聯應毅然宣告不承認傀儡組織=</p>
<p>=深信各國對非法組織有嚴正表示=</p>
<p>（南京）國聯九國委員會起草報告書之工作、現已進行至最後之建議部份、惟據報告、有某某等國對於明白規定不承認僞滿洲國一節、表示猶豫、關於此事、外交部長羅文幹氏本日發表談話如下、外聯現已達到嚴重時期、應以大無畏之精神、將國聯行政院及大會歷次决議所包含、與國聯自身所代表之偉大原則、毅然援用、查夫歲三月十一日國聯大會决議案中、曾載有一原則、即國聯會員國對於違反國聯盟約及巴黎公約之方法所造成之局勢、或締結之條約或協定、均不應予以承認、彼在日内瓦之列强代表、今竟于明白宣言否認滿洲之傀儡政府一事、表示遲疑、似係對于彼等因贊成上述决議案之原則、所已允担受之責任、意欲設法規避、夫滿洲國者、李頓報告書中固早已認爲全因日軍在滿、始克存在、則其有背于國聯盟約及巴黎公約、自爲毫不容疑之事、由國聯宣告此項傀儡組織不應爲尊重中國主權之國家所承認、乃適用不承認原則時必要而且合理之步驟、而此項不承認原則、業經各國所宣且接受者也、苟有任何一國表示願爲將來留非法承認滿洲國之地步、則是該國不僅謀欲破壞三月十一日决議案之效力、且欲破壞國聯盟約及非戰公約之效、至屬顯然、中國不信此項情勢果將實現、而深信所有關係各國對於爲日本侵略工具之菲法組織、必將有嚴正之表示、（一日中央社電）</p>
<h3>因内田演說激起蘇俄憤懣</h3>
<p>經兩國換文略呈和緩</p>
<p>日使太田致俄政府照會</p>
<p>聲明政軍當局見解不同</p>
<p>（莫斯科）此間報紙今日發表蘇聯外交副委員長加拉罕與日大使太田所交換關於日外相内田最近在議會演說之照會、太田於照會中向蘇聯政府表明、莫洛托夫在最近蘇聯中報委大會还說中所稱日外相於議會中重複日陸軍省公報之反蘇聯謡言、與實際不符、内田演說在内容及意義上、全與陸軍省公報不同、該演說中主張日蘇應設法保持友善關係、同時防止「誤解」之發生、加拉罕於答復照會中表示、蘇聯政府以爲不必斤斤討論照會中所述及之二種意見之問題、惟自太田之照會中、已認知日本政府不願與日陸軍省之公報、抱同一之見解、同時加氏謂彼將照太田所表示之希望、、發表此次交換之照會云、（一日塔斯社電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）日本荒木陸相一月十五日宣言所引起之俄日兩國緊張局勢、現信經蘇俄外交副委員加拉罕與日本大使太田今日交換公文後、業已大爲弛緩、按自荒木發表宣言後、蘇俄政府即稍覺憤怒不寗、守候日政府之繼續解釋、旣成日本内田外相在衆院演說後、蘇俄又接有日外相重申荒木言論消息、於是蘇人民委員會主席莫洛托夫逐在中央報行委員會議演說、報告内田重申荒木之說、因此兩國間形勢益覺緊張、迨今日太田大使將内田外相演說原文磅達加拉罕、說明當時關於聯俄之語、皆屬友誼論調、前此蘇俄所接消息、全屬訛傳、並謂渠深知莫洛托夫之言、純係出於誤會所致、要求爲兩國睦誼起見、加以更正、於是加拉罕乃發一簡短覆文、聲稱蘇俄政府已考慮日本政府無意證實其陸相宣言之事實、至日本陸相所稱者、業經蘇俄政府竭力否認云云、太田大使遂要求公布往來公文、蘇俄立允其請、現信此事因此一番換文、已告結束、（一日國民社電）</p>

<h3>世界果無公理耶元</h3>
<p>今日國際聯盟對於中日問題顯然已宣告失敗。維持和平之運動。亦已宣告失敗。此其失敗之責任。屬之誰乎。國聯有公平之主張。能援用會章公約而失敗。和平仍歸於破裂。是其責任。在公理之不敵强權。而不在主持國聯之各大國。若國聯不有公平之主張。不援用會章公约而失敗。而和平破裂。則其失敗之責任。在主持國聯之各大國而不在公理。此其界限。無論何人。均能明白。太今日之事。而謂世無公理。寗非大寃。</p>
<p>美國不可謂不有主張公理之表示矣。他若顼士捷克西班牙比利時等國。亦未嘗不有公理之主張也。然而美則非國聯之會員也。瑞士捷克等國。雖爲國聯之會員。而奈何其爲小國也。故以國聯自身言之。絶未嘗稍稍運用公理。惟我中國國勢雖弱。而認識公理則甚明。今日世界各國孰能主張公理者我識之。孰爲保守中立而自處旁觀者我識之。熟爲偏助强權而向我落井下石者我亦識之。我人自信國如不亡而尙得列於國際之林者。今後終必有與公理相見之一日。</p>
<p>今日非無公理。不過公理爲一時强權所掩蔽而不能顯。故吾人一方面須拼我鐵血以擁護公理以與强權者奮鬭。一方面則認明凡能主張公理之國。雖不能於實際上有所援助。我人亦感激之而認爲至友。蓋我人固已明白在此經濟恐慌達於極度之世界。各國各謀自保不暇之民界。决不能有所援助於我。故苟能保守其中正之態度而不偏助强權者。已爲我人所欣感。我友邦其識之。我國人必誓死以力爭此公理。國聯有運用公理之權而不用。我人則必拚命從强權者手中。奪取公理而置之於光天化日之世界。不然則寗與公理俱亡。寗與世界和平俱亡。</p>

<h3>德新總理與中央黨談判决裂</h3>
<p>預料國會日内將被解散</p>
<p>國民一日柏林電　德總理希特勒與兩中央黨（即天主敎中央黨與巴威人民黨）談判决裂、逆料國會定將於數日内解散、唯其日期究在二月七日召集以前抵在開會之後、則猶難預定、</p>
<p>國民一日柏林電　今日德總統已簽一解散國會令交付内閣、屬遇必要時、便可發表、現内閣旣得此令、實際上已暫成狄克推多、據午間消息、内閣將以下午集議討論國會形勢、因内閣在國會内現尙未得大多數擁護、但信國社黨旣柄政後、此層當亦不難辦到也、又聞内閣將於總統所簽解散國會令送與戈林、並囑其阻止國會開會、因戈林爲普魯士行政委員、有節制全普警察之　也、至内閣今日之請求解散國會令、殆聞社會黨員一俟國會開會即將提出不信任動議所致、倘若國會解散後、料總選舉將定在三月五日、而政府在此期間便可施行其政策、不虞他人掣肘云、</p>
<p>國民卅一日柏林電　德國新政府成立之後、現已開始各項急要事項之整理工作、據柏林地方指示報所載、新内閣第一步工作、擬將工業及農業兩方面所持意見不同之處、加以調解、使雙方均能與政府合作、庶政府得從事於盛　之經濟計劃、而期失業者得有急速之救濟云、地方指示報爲新任經濟部長胡根堡氏所創辦、故該報所載當然可認爲内閣方面最迅速之消息、再則内閣對於所欠各國短期債欵之應如何整理、亦當加以討論云、至於人民方面、自新内閣成立之後、其與天主敎中央黨所開之談判、究已至何地步、該黨是否願與新政府合作、此等問題實最饒興趣、今日新總理希特勒曾與中央黨領袖人物如喀斯及斐理歇等長談二小時餘、據云、喀斯氏曾向希特勒提出問題多條要求希氏一一加以答復、而中央黨之究能合作與否、則須視答復之如何、希氏當於今晚閣議中提出討論云、又復據報紙所載、政府方面頗願國會能同意於繼延會數月、並頗願國會能通過議案、使内閣有自由處理各急要問題之全權云、唯此種議案之通過、必須國會三分之二以上之同意、始可實現、觀於社會民主黨及共産黨等之反對、殊難成爲事實也、故新任内長費立克氏曾表示將來國會之解散、恐仍不可免、唯望再度選舉之結果、能較今日所有者爲進步云、</p>
<p>國民卅一日柏林電　德京證券交易、以新政府宣布謹守法律範圍、不作何種經濟嘗試之舉動、致肇成金融界之然機、故今日一切證券市價已大見起色、增價之高自二磅音至七磅音半不等、再則外間師復資本主義之傾向一說、頗見濃厚、此亦爲證券市塲爭相購進之一原因也、</p>
<h3>猶太人惶惶不寧</h3>

<h3>共産黨員小紛擾</h3>
<p>路透三十一日柏林電　柏林今日除有國社黨學生略作示威運動外、尙稱安靜、學生亦僅列隊至交易所大呼「打倒操縱求利者、』巴伐利亞有許多鎭發生國社黨與共産黨員之巷鬥、結果死二人、傷多人、白里斯洛大學國社黨學生要求停止猶太敎授之演講、曾作反猶太之示威運動、今日繼以共産黨員與警察之衝突、擊斃共産黨員一人、又重傷珦人、共産黨員旋肆擾商店、並搗毀國社黨報紙之展覽架、雖損失頗巨、報未傷人、總理希特勒今晚發表宣言書、申謝國社黨男女同志之竭誠襄助、並謝興登堡總統之慨然决定任渠爲總理、今日阿姆斯特丹消息、德前皇内府管理員宣稱、前皇對於德國現政府不欲發表任何意見、前皇並否認某擬離村恩之說、指外傳已備汽車載以回國之說、純屬揑造云、</p>
<h3>美海軍演習襲擊戰術</h3>
<p>國民卅一日火奴魯魯電　今日美國會操中之巡洋艦七艘、率同驅逐艦數艘、突然出現於摩羅凱島外、按此舉對於檀島防務之影響及檀島是否不易爲敵艦隊佔領問題、各海軍專家雖將俟會操完畢後加以論斷、但聞此項巡洋艦原期出現於他處、乃今晨黎明時突然發見於摩羅凱島旁、實屬大可注意之一事、當巡洋艦發見後、立即報告珠港、而全島人民亦遂停止工作、靜等天空戰爭之開始、按此次美艦隊係於數日前在美國太平洋濱出發、試作攻佔檀島之演習、其戰鬧艦隊現在何處、猶無所聞、至此次會操時期歷時頗短、因各艦隊須於二月十七日以前加抵舊金山、參加金門橋破土典禮云、</p>
<h3>軍縮主幹會議</h3>
<p>討論違反公約揭發問題</p>
<p>哈瓦斯三十一日日内瓦電　軍縮會議主席團今晨開會、所討論者仍爲未來軍縮公約違反行爲之宣布或揭發問題、主席團對於宣布或揭發諸人之保障問題、意見仍不一致、西班牙代表馬達里加氏極不以游移態度爲然、渠謂西班牙政府對於揭發者、贊成予以保障、法國代表馬西格里、爲便於討論計、提出具體辦法、即㈠國家違反軍縮公約者、私人加以揭發、其人如非受國家俸給之人員、則不得加以任何刑事上之責任、㈡揭發之人意在誣衊者、其懲治亦應公開、否則國際當設委員會應派員參加辯論、㈢揭發之人如係公務員、亦受同等保障、惟以反欲揭發之事件、先行通知該管長官爲條件、法國代表之建議當經提付特别委員會審查、主席漢德森宣言、總委員會將於星期四日下午開會、以討論法國所提之軍縮及安全建設計畫云、</p>

<p>財政難關不易穏渡</p>
<p>國民社一日巴黎電　法國新閣因閣員平均年齡在歷史上爲最輕、現有少年急進内閣之稱、但以台拉第深得人心、新内閣頗受報紙與民衆之歡迎、但一般意見皆恐其壽命亦將如前閣之未必能永、因其與彭古内閣之性質旣無大異、龐萊雖爲理財能手、能否穏渡財政經濟難關、仍屬疑問云、</p>
<p>路透一日巴黎電　新政府之宣言將於星期五日在國會提出表决、似不致發生任何危險、該宣言書之起草、殊費躊躇、蓋不能不揭開政府財政計畫之幕也、新財長龐萊之算術、必異於前長薛隆無異、惟新財長大約將募債以事彌補、此前長所力避者也、社會黨員昨日被擯於政府後、交易所殊呈旺象、</p>

<p>覆··來書讀了數遍，作答頗難；因爲足下所言與我輩所朝夕思維者，至少相隔要有兩個世紀，又好比身在𤍠帶而與北極人做寒暄，簡直不知從何說起，這是一。足下對於近代政治理論與其歷史缺乏水平線上的智識，若要做答，勢必非從頭說起不可，這是二。即就足下原文分析，其主要之點，大都囫圇吞棗，無一定之槪念，仅人摸不着頭腦，古人云『妾身未分明，何以拜姑樟』？果眞做答，那也爲是驢唇不對馬嘴，所答非所問，這是三。現在我先就足下原函所指出數條做個商量，俟得足下確定地進一步的答復，再做詳細的討論··㈠來書說··『凡事「豫則立，不豫則廢」，中國改革二十二年，結果總是弄不好；就是中了「凡事做起來再說」的毛病。』滿清推翻，建立民國，形式上的開始雖在辛亥，而自滿清入關，明朝遺老即有反清之運動及其理論，及至鴉片戰爭以後，即有太平天國革命運動，在這一革命鬥爭中，已將最主要的民主任務提到議事日程；到了庚子之役，又有義和團，起來反抗帝國主義，牠雖然揭的『扶清滅洋』的旗幟，然而牠的反抗的暴力不但給帝國主義者一個當頭棒，而對於滿清政府也是一個極大的威脅。這兩次革命，雖然都失敗，而清廷却已不能不開學校，廢科舉，興實業，練新軍，及至各處革命運動橊釀甚久，排滿思想與保皇主義鬥爭甚烈，國人以清廷之無能，遂轉而渴望革命。逮至辛亥起義，各省靡然風從。這一種相摩相盪，繼長增高的歷史，差不多有三百年之久，還能算是『不豫』麽？在足下看來，究竟怎樣『豫』法？所謂『豫』者何事？果眞如清廷所謂『豫備立憲』之『豫』乎？而且我們曉得，無論一人一家一地方一國家，他的生活改進或變革的計劃，絶不是由什麽偉人名流，關起門來個人幻想出來的，而是在實際的鬥爭中，體騐出當前的需要，因而形式的。現在中國人的毛病，不是什麽没有計劃，也不是什麽没有『豫』備，而是根本没有『做起』，即如抗日罷，我們天天聽見說什麽抗日已有决心，其實什麽决心都没有；天天聽見說什麽，已有充分的準備，其實什麽準備都没有‘天天聽見說什麽長期抵抗，事實在那裏。足下所謂『凡事做起來再看』，實在適得其反！無論什麽事··做起來才有計劃，計劃與豫備是做的過程中的一部分，離開了做，那計劃與豫備，便成了一句欺人之談。這一層足下已經患了倒果爲因的毛病。㈡來信提出一個問題··『如何呌做是好國家？好政府？』這到是很重要的一個問題，你的答案是『國内人人安居樂業』，這話說錯了，五洲萬國，古今中外，絶找不出一個『人人安居樂業』的好國家和好政府。足下對於這個問題，也只能做這種不着邊際的答案。因爲你不先說明國家是什麽，怎樣能以說明國家的好壞；不先說明政府是什麽，又怎樣能以說明政府的好壞？我要唐突一句··足下不是不曾說明國家或政府是什麽，而是根本不曾弄清楚國家究竟是一個什麽東西，政府又是一個什麽東西，所以說出什麽『國之所以立，』這一類的話！此路一差，便無往而不錯誤。㈢來信又說『二十二年來，中國政治上各種制度都曾試遍了，結果無一是『行』原文係『興』，語意不明，因代改『行』字），這話更錯了！所謂『各種制度』，究竟一些什麽制度？所謂『都嘗試遍了』，究在什麽地方嘗試過？老實說，我們都是打戊午變政，八國聯軍，辛亥革命，洪憲后帝夢這些潮流裏滾過來的，你說罷，究竟是些什麽『各種制度』！㈣來信說··『本來一國有一國的歷史人情風俗習慣，』這又是一句『四和湯』的話，怎樣呌做『四和湯』？一些庸醫給人診病，不能斷定人家的眞正病源，不敢下眞正治病的藥，於是總是開些『甘草，防風，荆芥，寸冬』給人吃，名呌四和湯，病家吃了雖不能除病，也不致因而增病（其實即是庸醫殺人），敷衍騙錢。一班頭腦冬烘的人動不動說什麽『歷史，人情，風俗，習慣』但我要問··歷史是什麽東西？人情是什麽東西？風俗習慣又是什麽東西？牠們是怎麽樣産生出來的。菲果你不能說明牠們的來源那你還是慢開口先研究一下的好。㈤來信旣說··『中國厪是君主立憲，算不定歷年及現在之軍閥交閧可以少見些？』你是在主張君主立憲了。然而又說··『我又想凡是有權的組織，不管他大的小的，我以爲獨裁制度好。美雖共和，但他的總統，是獨裁制的；國務卿無異作他的幕僚。意之墨索里尼，俄之斯太林，都是獨裁化。又在主張『個人獨裁』。『獨裁』究竟是怎麽一會事？英國的君主立憲，固然不是個人獨裁，然而牠不是懸在空中的，而是有牠的社會基礎，即階級的羣衆的，至於俄之斯太林與意之墨索里尼，在一方面說來雖說是個人獨裁，然而他們的獨裁是絶大相侔的，是各有其階級背影的。俄國的政治制充是無産階級專政，即無産階級獨裁，所謂『斯太林』獨裁，實不過無産階级獨裁之初期的過程中一個短期的歷史；墨索里尼的獨裁，也不過是法西斯蒂，即極右派的，極反動的資産階級專政的一個代表人，斷没有一個没有其羣衆基礎而單純的個人獨裁。斯墨之間相去奚啻十萬八千里？足下把他們聚一爐而冶之，足見足下似缺乏分析的　腦。（明日續完）</p>

<h3>香港網球界迫狀徐惠培有握錦標希望</h3>
<p>十九歲青年羣日爲未來冠軍</p>
<p>一鳴驚人小倫强之唯一勁敵</p>
<p>雙打錦標倫强昆仲恐少敵手</p>
<p>（香港通訊）全港草地網球錦標賽、卽將開始、香江名手、皆參加奪標、如小倫强大倫强芬巧等、而最爲人注目、認爲香港未來之冠軍、則華人十九歲青年徐惠培是也、各方一致推重、觀測相同、亦爲中國網球前途之一大希望、</p>
<p>冠軍行將易主</p>
<p>在本同之錦標賽中、錦標大有易主可能、將産生一新的冠軍、新的覇主、使香港之網球界、耳目一新、小倫强SirdarRumjahn爲錦標之保持者、而人目爲小倫强之勁敵、卽上届埠際賽中痛擊上海老將惠特之徐惠培、單打如此、而雙打則恐罕有能與倫强昆仲相敵、</p>
<p>徐惠培之成绩</p>
<p>徐惠培於埠際賽中、一鳴驚人、落三大敗上海名將惠特、其出球之速、港中無有可與之比擬、反手更爲其傑作、在最近過去之成績、從未遭有挫折、以其成功之過易、於是爲之躭心亦大有其人、以爲勝易敗易、平心論之、徐如於最佳之情形中、可敢言港中無能與敵、果然而徐　全港冠軍、其成績必能與對付惠特者、相差無幾、</p>
<p>芬巧與大倫强</p>
<p>芬巧於過去之三年中、屢奪冠軍、皆功虧一簣、本年徐惠培小倫强當前、恐仍無希望、至於大倫强Ｈ·Ｄ·Rumjahn連年奮鬥、但皆目爲非戰打選手、努力之結果、仍不能改變局外之觀望、大倫强在港、名列第三、其球藝確已進步不少、如抽簽排列時、較爲幸運、或能達最後之决賽、</p>
<p>英海軍司令配克</p>
<p>一羣名手中、可引人注意者、尙有一人、爲英艦肯脫號之配克司令、配克最近於對芬巧之一局中、表演奇佳、而對小倫强之練習賽、又以二比一得勝、其反手之佳、宛如徐惠培、最後之八人配克必居其一、</p>
<p>雙打七組之配合</p>
<p>雙打中、自然以倫强昆仲一組最强、希望最高、然變化無窮、在勁敵不少中、尙難斷言也、雙打配合如下、</p>

<h3>主婦的責任</h3>
<p>— 潘仰</p>
<p>主婦在家庭裏負有重大的責任，一家的大事小事都雲集一身，一切生活上服用物品，她們操着取捨之權；除去一部大權旁落的畸形家庭之外，中國的主婦實在是一家的指揮者。倘使是大家庭，太太們雖然可以時常討論，但是一般人都抱着不在其位的觀念，所以誰擔當了這項重任，開門七件事便是你的專職。至於一般小家庭呢，主人們爲着職業的奔波，又怎能帶着疲勞來一一顧問，所以只有偏勞主婦了。以上是說的事實，至於女子應否要從家庭中跑到社會上去，那還在理論爭持的時候，因不在本文範圍之内，可以不必討論。</p>
<p>在目前事實上證明，主婦旣是家庭生活的主宰，於消費者的立塲上，佔有重要的地位；所以在這一次國貨運動，主婦實負有重要的責任和使命。嚴重的國難和鉅額的入超，處處足以儆惕我們的迷夢，就家庭經濟學上講，我們固然不應該服用定價高昂的舶來品；而新興的國産物品，有很多比外貨好的多，有的也能替代外貨，爲着我們是中國人的緣故，我們便應該樹立服用國貨的决心。從今以後、不要再惠臨推銷舶來品的店家，應該多多的光顧中國國貨公司。</p>
<p>己往一般人被崇拜外貨的思想所支配，主婦們｜尤其是摩登的士女，認爲服用外貨是時髦漂亮。其實世界任何國家中，只有以服用國貨爲美德的觀念。足跡到了中國國貨公司，是光榮的，有志氣的，有决心的。我們明白了這點以後，負有重大責任的主婦們，應即責無帝貸的努力實現。根據著正確的觀念，力闢那謬誤的思想，我愛國貨，我用國貨，我買國貨，良心上獲得莫大的安慰，又誰敢說這是如何的不漂亮，因爲這是一件美德呵！</p>
<p>挽回每年五萬萬兩的入超，這正是我們主婦的責任，我們應該毫不猶豫的負起這重大的責任來。</p>
<h3>國貨年的四大工作</h3>
<p>— 靄吳</p>
<p>一、提高消費程度　提倡國貨，果然要提倡製造，增加産量，更要提高國人對於國貨的消費程度。消費程度一提高，國貨销路暢旺，大家見有利可圖，都願製造國貨。消費程度不提高，一味提倡製造，結果陳貨　滯，金融停頓，工廠破産，工人失業，生産過剩，危險很大。提高消費程度，方法很多，鼓吹宣傳奬勵等等都是，找以爲最有效力的，還是希望全國公私各團體，一致起來，所有大小員工，一律穿着國貨，使用國貨，不到一年，定能轉移風氣。古人說的好，君子之德風，小人之德草，草上之風必偃。古今來此種例子很多，俯拾即是。</p>
<p>二、注意貨身價格　價廉物美，是推銷國貨的不二法門。價廉而物不美，只有很少數的二層階級中人來買；物美而價不廉，只有很少數的上層階級中人來買；倘使物旣不美，價又不廉，那末無人顧問，原在情理之中。中國人的通病，一件東西有了銷路，不是偷工减料，便是抬高價格，結果等於自殺，這是今後大家要嚴重注意的。</p>
<p>三、保障發明權利　發明　件東西，費掉許多心血，别人見他得利，大家起來仿造，弄得供過於求，不得不跌價，以求脫手。你也跌價，我也跌價，跌之不已，至於蝕本，結果是兩敗俱傷，互替外貨　侵入的機会。所以今後無論何人，倘有發明，應向法定機關註明，　經註册，切實保障他的發明權利，如此辦法，大家自然去用苦功夫，不敢取巧了。</p>
<p>四、訓練國貨人員　製造的人員，果然要調練，售貨的人員，也要訓練，要求訓練切實有效，當請專家辦理，這是推行國貨的基本，不可吝惜小費。單就訓練售貨人員來說，如保訓練他的技能？如何補充他的常識？如何培養他的道德？都是很複雜的問題。</p>
<p>國貨年的國貨界，應把這四件事情，切實去做。不空箴口號，不貪多務得，不一暴十寒，我敢肯定的說，國貨前途，定放光明。</p>

<h3>土老兒</h3>
<p>— 沈友石</p>
<p>我是一個小民罷了，那裏配得上在這偌大的申報國貨週刋上，說些不三不四的話頭呢？但是，我看見許多名人在國貨週刋上，發表許多極有價值的文字；不知不覺的使我也眼紅了，｜也想說幾句來解解悶呢？好在··「天下興亡，匹夫有責。」我就拿了匹夫的資格來說說了。</p>
<p>我是一個鄕下人，吃粉筆灰的人，大家都看不起的一個小學敎員。我走到都市中去，｜尤其是上海，｜總是異口同聲的說··「土老兒。」因爲身完全是土布的衣服，就賞賜了這一個雅號。吟閣先生說··「這是亡國的心理。」但是我在鄕下，那個人敢說我土老兒呢？那末，鄕下竟没有這種亡國的心理··所以，亡國是亡在都市，而不是亡在鄕村呢！</p>
<p>眞正使我奇怪的｜吳稚暉先生着了土布衣，人家都稱贊他說是提倡國貨。但是，我看了，却適得其反呢！</p>
<p>知道了！他們是大人物，我們是小脚蚤，小脚蚤不配救國，大人物都是應該救國的！</p>
<p>不對！不對！我明明是提倡國貨，是救國，人家却來駡我，而駡我的却是稱爲智識開通的通市人。唉！國家被你們那些都市人亡去了尤其是那些大人物呢！不然，爲什麽吳老先生提倡國貨就大驚小怪的稱贊呢？鄕下人天天在那兒提倡國貨，有誰來說他愛國呢？</p>
<p>還有國貨週刋編餘上說··「新郎新娘都要服用國貨，才去做證婚人······」那有什麽希奇！你看那鄕下人，天天有人在結婚，不是穿着土布麽？有誰來稱贊呢？可知都市人都在用外國貨，尤其是大人物也在用外國貨；偶然有人穿了土布不免大驚小怪了！我不禁又嘆道··「中國被那些人亡了！」</p>
<p>由此可見越是有智識的人，越是高唱着提倡國貨的人，我希望他們··｜是苛刻的說一句｜各人自己能夠不用外貨就好啦！</p>
<p>這些話恐怕觸犯了許多都市人，編者總是冷冷的一笑，丢在字紙箱裏罷？但事實是這樣的彰明較著，並且匹夫也有救國的責任，所以，我就不習繁勞的，在課後寫出來了。假使有好我同情的，這是我唯一的希望啊！誰有高明的意見，尙望賜敎！</p>

<h3>冰話</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>一陣陣的朔風吹硬着江南軟温的水，你道它「决諸東方則東流，决諸西方則西流」麽？它竟熱着硬寨和　　的朔風决　一塲，「撼山易撼河港冰　」，越是朔風壓逼的緊，實的陣地越是和綱鐵一般的不可動摇！它是個硬漢，它是個拚命抵抗者！它能對付嚴厲的溯風，它都不　對付温和的春風，只須微微的吹拂着，嘿！它竟不能自持了！宛比一曲楚歌吹散了八千子弟兵，實的團體解散了！它的態度變遷了！它不是冰而是水了！它的顔面跟着賽風而高低了！要它成淪便成淪，要它成漪便虎漪；它是個弱者！它是個不抵抗主義者！唉！以前硬朗朗的態度到了那裏去呢？</p>
<p>在那前幾天點滴成冰的當兒，一切瓶兒壷兒缸兒髪兒以及零星的玻質磁質器皿，宛比大小貪官污吏聽得查辦令下，趕快地把中飽的贓私設法寄出！所有它們腹中存貯的水、嘔的嘔，吐的吐，倒的倒，瀉的瀉，表示它們都生就一個絶無所有的廉潔肚皮。要是嘔吐　瀉的工作遲了一下子，嘿！好不　害！中飽的東西一旦膨脹起來，任憑號　「門裏大」的七石缸，也會脹破大肚皮囊　了三分五裂！吾願把那碎裂的七石缸，做一般貪官污吏的冰　。</p>

<h3>大衆的集合</h3>
<p>— 人英</p>
<p>舊曆新年的大世界週圍</p>
<p>本來是熱閙的地段，更加是在舊曆的新年中。一羣羣出賣勞力的工人，是可以得到三四天的休息。在那大世界畔，擁擠着像波浪樣的人頭。他們竟年的在銷靡着血和力，現在是當那儘有的幾天；找尋着像沙漠中的露水樣寳貴的娛樂。</p>
<p>大世界對面的水門汀上，充滿着一隊隊山東人的賣藝者。曾經拆穿了的西洋鏡，藍布帷幕裏的木偶戲。奇怪的呌喊，節奏的鑼聲，圈子外裹圍着一隊隊翹首盼望的羣衆。大世界的門前，鐵門已經拉攏了；大約也在鬧着客滿的把戲。一羣在夜晚的寒風裏，等着沽客的雉妓；在這時漸漸的出現了。紅的袍，綠的襖，白色的鉛粉，紅色的胭脂，這在勞苦大衆的眼光中，是追求異性的對象。而在都市少爺的視線下，這正是可怕的魔鬼。一羣無聊的流氓，儘把花紙的鞭砲，向着太太小姐們的脚邊抛。怨恨的粉靨，換得了流氓們猙獰的笑貎。</p>
<p>三隻紙牌的把戲，也在路邊出現了。緩和的㕬喝聲，銀洋的碰撞聲。一羣人圍滿了木板的攤子，圈子外面守望着戴尖頂帽紮褲脚管的朋友。財神老爺的靈籤，有一般半老的徐娘；儘把一個銅子往筒裏裝。經過幾家商店門口，貼滿了桃紅色的春聯，在孩童時候使我最愛聽的年鼓聲，也在門縫裏波蕩出來。朝西一望，一輪鮮紅的落日反映着一二八烈士的血花。</p>
<h3>整容</h3>
<p>— 賢賢</p>
<p>｜可以救國｜</p>
<p>廢歷年底，據說是腐化的同胞，都應當到理髪店去整容一下，可把一年晦氣，一掃而光。像我這種受了洗禮，而兀是對着烈祖列宗的神位，祭神如神在的腐化份子，當然不能因爲「年常舊規，每客加倍」而免此一舉。</p>
<p>本理髪店的大鏡子裏，照見我這顱影自憐，不堪承敎的尊範。從天庭一眼溜到天角，覺得幾綹不長不短的髭鬍，旣不清朗，又不于思，有些　　尷尬，煞是難看。望望左右的同志，也都是刺蝟式的髭鬍。我於是武斷地證明。我們大</p>
<h3>笑話</h3>
<p>小學校的敎員，上地理敎課，呌學生指認世界地圖的地位。</p>
<p>敎員｜｜「趙生，你上講臺來，美國是在什麽地方？指認出來！」</p>
<p>趙生｜｜在這裏。</p>
<p>敎員｜｜「是的，走下去！」</p>
<p>敎員｜｜諸位，知道發見美國的人是誰？</p>
<p>王生｜｜急忙的起來說道··「是趙君」。</p>
<p>敎員｜｜「趙君是指認地圖上的美國，發見美國的是哥倫布。」（瑞）</p>
<p>中華國的老百姓，雖不是千篇一律，可是老百姓的髭鬍，倒是「萬　一式」。因爲中國人對於每天清早剃髭鬍的習慣，　　「人爲萬物之靈」，如何可說「人不如狗」？未免有凟人之尊嚴。雖然事實告訴我們，人，的確不如狗！</p>
<p>我們知道，一隻狗得到了它的主人的龐甩，便似天之驕子。不但飮食講究，｜牛肉和餅乾｜而且住也安適，｜洋房與花園｜有時它的主人，坐了汽車出去，那麽，實格外幸運，因爲追隨它主人的左右，居然還得叨光坐一下汽車。我們走在路上，有時瞧見那許許多多風馳電掣般的汽車中，便有這麽一輛，上面除了端坐的主人，和開車的車夫以外，還有的，就是這麽一隻「大一點」蹲伏其上，虎視一切。我想世人有多少人，眞愧不如它哩！這便是『人不如狗』的一個事實。</p>
<p>其次的事實，就是狗生義氣，相傳馬，羊，虎，狗。爲忠，孝，節，義。那麽，在現今世上，太凡無忠無孝，無節無義的人，非但不如狗，就是馬，羊，虎，也不如哩！不過，我現在旣談的是『人不如狗，』自然，還是談狗。狗的義氣，就在能替它主人盡守衛之責，以報它主人的餧養之恩。像三家村裏的狗，見了村外來的主人，便知道狂吠追逐</p>
<p>小說</p>
<h3>照相</h3>
<p>— 墨逸</p>
<p>關外的天氣，秋冬兩季幾乎没有什麽分别；酷熱的夏季一給肅殺的秋風趕走，如刀刮針刺般的冬季特有的西北風便怒吼起來了。漫天的黃沙像海洋中的波浪滾滾的在天空翻騰着；而層層的烏雲中藴藏着的雪花，經過幾天西北風的打擊，寒暑表上的水銀降到了零度以下的時候，但掃蕩了黃沙，飛舞在空中了。大地上堆積了很厚的雪，先給西北風吹得凝凍起來，彷彿在地上蓋了一層大理石，繼而天晴，温和的陽光射出它的熱度，到處調和着空氣，雪塊就融化了，泥濘的路途上，簡直没法兒挿足；但等到太陽給夜逼走了，或者再加上一層雪以後，又凍成冰塊，就這樣忽而凝凍，忽而融化，一直到了明年三四月才能看見原來的地面。</p>
<p>一個下了四五天大雪後的早晨，太陽從地平線下爬了起來，並不是往常那種笑容，淡淡的陽光看它的樣兒似乎在發愁。撫順縣，栗子溝村子裏的人們，昨天夜裏聽了整夜的槍聲和喊殺聲，就没有什麽敢睡覺··今天一早起床，全是臉上堆着驚訝的神色，三三兩兩的在一起互相猜想昨夜的槍聲和喊殺聲的來源。</p>
<p>「昨天夜裏，你們全没有睡覺罷？」張榮久和他的鄰居王福根和趙大坐在他家廊　下晒太陽，他的手指彈了一彈烟灰說。</p>
<p>「那兒敢睡哟！不是聽了一夜的槍聲麽！你呢？」王福根燃着了烟，使勁兒抽了兩口說。</p>
<p>「這麽熱鬧了一夜，又不知道怎麽一回事兒？」趙大瞅着王福根鼻孔和嘴裏吐出來的一圈圈的烟說。</p>
<p>「我想，大槪又是義勇軍跟矮子幹了一夜！」</p>
<p>「準是的。不知道勝敗怎樣？」</p>
<p>「對了，昨天早上不是有三個······」趙大像想起了什麽似的說了「半，瞧見一個陌生人一瘤一拐踏着微有點兒融化的雪塊沙沙的走了進來，便没有往下說。</p>
<p>「請······請你們······樓······我一······一下，哟······痛······痛哟······」那個突然而來的人，臉色蒼黃，咬着牙，很痛苦的喊着。</p>
<p>他瘊三個人便一起站了起來，跑過去攙了那個人，坐在廊簷下··他們三個人圍了他站着。（一）</p>
<p>我可担保百分之九十九以上，根本都不想養成。</p>
<p>說了上車字廢話，倘未說到「整容」，如何「可以救國」。哪，我有我的歪理第十八條。</p>
<p>洋鬼子雖然一身狐騷臭，可是對於下　的髭鬍倒有不共戴天之仇，剛睜開眼，便用剃刀，刮得一乾二淨。就是人中上留上一撮小鬍鬚，也必把範圍以外的髭鬍，剃得寸草不留。所以白種民族，十分之九，都是國勢强盛的。我們中國人，儘有剪髪時順便剃一下髭鬍之外，終年不修面的，這正象微　中國的政治，除了偶然的似乎有一些清明的希望，而終於一年到底，自春徂冬，陷於黑暗而混亂的狀態中。</p>
<p>留居在上海的白俄浪人，髭鬍是終年不修的，他們没有祖國了。印度黑炭的髭鬍，更是怕人，他們是英人的奴隸。不修面的中國人，如何？</p>
<p>同胞們，要救國，趕快把「整容」，當作早晨第一課。</p>
<h3>人不如狗怡怡館主</h3>
<p>｜兩種事實的比較｜</p>
<p>。膽大的，給它震住！膽小的，給它嚇跑！至於人呢？平時享受了一切的權利，到了有事的時候，不知盡一點義務！如今國難，來了暴敵，能夠抵抗的，只有少數的義軍！其他的，不是做了『漢奸』，便是做了『奸商』，這種人，又何嘗及得上一隻狗呢？唉！總而言之，人，的確不如狗啊！</p>
<p>拉雜記</p>
<h3>口九味茶</h3>
<p>— 張亦菴</p>
<p>我們廣東人有一種藥劑呌作「九味茶」，是有許多拉維的藥品配合而成的，裏面所包含的，甚至連陳舊的牛糞，破碎的碗井都兼收並蓄。（這是眞的話。）嚴格地說起來，每劑完備的九味茶裏頭所有的藥品數目是不止九味的，所以又名「拉（讀如臘）雜茶」。但是原始的九味茶恐怕不過九味，經後人的增配，才逐漸地增加了。</p>
<p>這九味茶據說能醫治多種毛病，尤其是事有感冒性的发𤍠，食滯等。據我的經騐，腸胃�</p>
<p>等病，九味茶往往頗能奏效，然而有此毛病却未必見功。這藥非出於名醫或專家所配合其藥物又有許多不見於本草經傳，而容又如此其拉雜，服用有時見效，有時無效，而味道又苦答答地不討人歡喜，我以爲這倒頗類似我這篇東西，因此便取以爲名。我這篇雖拉雜得如九味茶，至此其功用是否相當，則我不立保單。先此聲明。</p>
<p>一團高興，到時忽然不能實現，這原是很呌人悵惘的。誠然，人總要向着所希望的目的去努力，得一步是一步，無論怎樣失敗總不宜灰心。我自己給希望愚弄得多了··十二分的努力，結果往往像一個肥皂泡般消散了。有過這樣的多次的經騐，以後就不大敢信託希望。希望是有的，不過不敢期望它會有如我預定下來的結果。只管盡我的力幹去，也不必一定灰心，到時候結果如何，只好任其自然。比如預定到時是否去得成功，天時人事的阻碍是要預計到會發生的。你如果能這樣預先計慮到，則到時倒可以减少不少失望的難過。這種態度似乎近於中年人的冷淡而失郤少年人的𤍠烈了。不過經歷呌你要如此，你又何必强違自然而自騙？經騐是最科學的。（茅盾的幻滅似乎就是描寫這種心理。）</p>
<p>到無錫，得了下面的一些印象··</p>
<p>有一位朋友因爲曾在那裏居留了幾個月，陪着我們玩的時候，處處要顯出他對於無錫的在行。例如僱人力車的時候，他故意代我們把價錢遠到最低的數目。其實他所要表示在行的地方，我們都未必是外行呢。</p>
<p>也許因爲𤍠了渴了，所以覺得惠泉水烹的茶格外可口。如果惠泉水果眞是這樣了不得的好，下次得帶十來個𤍠水瓶來運它一點回上海</p>
<p>兩個人力車夫爲了爭一程生意，不惜跟同業揮拳動武。這也許就是生存競爭的小象徵。</p>
<p>坐在家裏是難得有新經騐的，想要得點新經騐，總要走出大門口，愈遠愈好。</p>
<p>太陽炙着野草的香味，在都市的人是嗅不着的，他們多數只嗅到了煤烟氣。</p>
<p>人力車夫因爲趕着搶生意，拉錯了一個同業的車子，吃那個車夫追上了，因而把我躭擱得落後了。</p>
<p>在城内公園裏有白「洋」布大黑字的標語，有仍然張貼着的「來賓留名處」的紙條，「女賓招待處」的紙條，有好些工役人等把椅子往園外搬走，園内的一部份顯然有點凌亂的狀態。我想這準是開什麽會，而且會期是已經過了，現在是散會以後的一種情景。第二天由報紙上知道原來是有一位黨部的黨員某君跟某女士在那裏舉行結婚禮。所以我說一定要出門看看才可以得到新經騐。</p>

<h3>標金未脫徘徊局面</h3>
<p>升降力｜薄弱</p>
<p>成交數｜細微</p>
<h3>跌了三錢</h3>
<p>昨據外電、倫敦大條近期縮零六二五、遠期跌一二五、英美美英兩匯兌升降俱微、紐約銀價小一二五、五金交易所遠期銀市亦跌一釐餘、及數毫不等、美棉亦降八磅音、是以金市開盤、漲爲七百八十六兩、然匯市未見佳妙、人心亦不似前日之穏、開後因花旗售出二月份美金廿八元五六二五而跌、但跌勢並不猛烈、時起週旋、後因匯豐掛牌未動、而降至七百八十二兩八錢、中央銀行前來開現、乃見拉上兩餘、嗣後極形和平、趨勢似萎、人心恍惚、銀行胃口亦時見出納、金價亦起仆頻繁、未見特殊變化、最後傳聞忽起、人心大驚、曾跌至七百八十一兩三錢、無似此項謡傳、與金市未見有苦何重大關係、買意尙濃、仍見回上、蓋銀行此時已少進出、匯市亦未起變化也、數錢之升降、乃定大局、最後以七百八十二兩四錢之價收盤、中央銀行雖開現不已、但數不多、掉期因缺乏多方頭寸之故、極度苦悶、貼價略高、討由空方貼出八錢、半日間上落極小、範圍亦狹、走勢仍在盤旋、今將半日間市况誌之如下</p>
<h3>過程單調</h3>
<p>開盤爲七百八十六兩、較之前收漲起三兩三錢、蓋海外銀市見跌也、物品開盤七百八十五兩五錢、是以套出條子、大德成首先售條、退爲五兩、花旗售出二月份美金廿八元五六二五、而至四兩半、福餘前來稍進、升至五兩、匯豐出本月份英匯一先令八便士一八七五、（此價與昨收相等）匯市續走疲途、元春恒餘兆豐昌俱售脫、至四兩内、五月份美金八七五不能脫售、恒餘又出、乃爲三兩四錢、大德成忽進、價漸升至四兩外、三井吃四月份美金七五、又好至四兩七錢、恒餘等又來脫售、又至四兩内、兆豐昌售至三兩半、蓋安達出三月份美金六八七五、順利亦猛出一百零五條、退爲三兩光景、進者似多、尙能立住、匯豐掛牌英美俱未更動、兆豐昌又出、降至二兩五錢、麥加利進五月份美金九三七五、恒餘來進、價乃盤旋而上、中央銀行卽於此際開現、大德成源茂永等上塲進條、旋升至四兩四錢、此時徘徊多次、而少交易、花旗吃進五月份美金八七五、價乃立住多時、無何宏利志豐永前來賣出、爲三兩半光景、恒興售出一百四十條、乃爲二兩九錢、中央雖來開現、條子不多、好起幾錢、永豐進條爲三兩半、恒興仍售、爲三兩光景、匯市銀行趨納、價亦逐漸步俏、回至三兩九錢、源茂永天豐永來售、散户猛撳、市况直下、人心驚恐萬分、舉動失措、立卽退至一兩三錢、恒餘來進、好到二兩、而屢有掙扎、入後恒興又售、而爲一兩半、此際已近收市、匯市興晨開相同、未分榮辱、價乃回漲一兩至二兩半、順利亦於此時略有買進、而物品則繼續套出條子、遂爲七百八十二兩四錢收盤、物品較低、爲一兩五錢、查半日間最高價七百八十六兩、最低價七百八十一兩三錢、有四兩七錢上落、結果較前日收市微跌三錢、</p>
<h3>多抑三錢</h3>
<p>揭價因匯豐掛牌未更、美匯仍計廿八元一二元、合標金價八百五十三兩三錢三分、照收盤價言約撳七十兩有餘、因金市較前收微跌三錢、是以揭價亦見多撳三錢、二月份登賬七百八十四兩、三月份登賬七百八十二兩、補水價七百八十二兩、</p>
<h3>交易零落</h3>
<p>檯面上交易不多、各號進出雖繁而俱少、綜計恒興大德成源春宏利志豐永兆豐昌順利天豐永丙興俱是賣方、福餘永豐大興永震昌祥瑞興義豐永同豐恒等俱進、恒餘源茂永先出後進、此外如日昌德康鴻康永等時有進出、而大致軋進、大連帮則售多於購、廣帮恒興出二百餘條、生大交易少數、三月份條額截至前日止、共計一萬七千四百餘條、</p>
<h3>開現不絶</h3>
<p>中央銀行開現約四五百條、價自三兩起至四角半、塲内由乾昌祥潤昌永大德成同豐恒等代做、</p>
<h3>烚赤靜默</h3>
<p>昨烚赤市况沉靜、未見正式成交、各現貨號及銀樓帮俱未下手、良以現貨來去俱呆、各號暫取旁觀、其價大致與前日相同、仍計照加十兩零二錢半</p>
<h3>掉期沉悶</h3>
<p>掉期與烚赤同病、平靜無聞、蓋多方頭寸似缺、而各現貨號亦趨於代中央銀行開現、爲較利故、更無成交矣、直至將近收市、纔由乾昌祥及恒興對做七十條、價由恒興（空方）貼予乾昌祥八錢、（雙方同意作七錢交賬）二月掉三月者、此外未見成交、二月份條額至前日止、尙剩二千八百七十七條、</p>
<h3>半日匯市過程絶平</h3>
<p>昨匯市極平淡、外電倫敦大條近期縮零六二五、遠期縮一二五、英美匯兌降一二五、但美英匯兌則升零六二五、紐約銀價及銀行私電俱跌一二五、遠期銀價亦小一釐光景、察此銀市應趨緊勢、但以銀行胃口賣意尙未全戢、故初開平平、入後匯豐掛牌英美俱未更動、金價雖降、匯市以預先做過硬面、亦未見再有變動、惟時見進出而已、交易不旺、市况呆滯、美豐略有結進、東洋行家略塞美金、匯豐則脫售先令、此外扒塞俱見、華比花旗出多於進、金業中先扒少數、入後則塞、半日間過程極平、先令無甚上落、美匯祇零六二五差度、三月份先做六二五、後做六八七五、及五月份九三七五與八七五相差、結果俱無甚升降、先令美金俱祇買賣之間、略有扳價而已、今將半天間銀行進出記次、</p>
<p>（英滙）晨開近期出價介乎一先令八便士一二五及一八七五之間、匯豐售予華比二月份一先令八便士一八七五、美豐出同月同價、中孚吃五月份三一二五、興業售予沙遜同月同價、安達花旗對做同月同價、正金扒花旗出二月份一八七五、正金塞華比吃四月份二五、收盤出價二三月同爲一先令八便士一八七五、進價二五、四月份二五、五月份同、進價三一二五、</p>
<p>（美滙）開盤近期出價廿八元半、（或五六元五六二五、三井進四月份七五、華比出三月份六二五、又進安達六八七五同月、麥加利進五月份九三七五、但花旗則扒同月份八七五、銀公司與盤根對做四月份七五、有利華比對做三月份六八七五、衆加利進四月份八一二五、麥加利及花旗俱吸四月份八一二五、花旗售予美豐二月份五六二五、又華比亦售予美豐二月份五六二五、收盤　價二月份廿八元五六二五、三月份六八七五、四月份七五、五月份八一二五、進價二月份廿八元六八七五、三月份七五、四月份八七五、五月份九三七五、美金一元、仍計銀三兩四錢五分五釐五忽半、</p>
<h3>大條近縮遠不動</h3>
<p>國民社一日倫敦電、大條近期略縮、收盤爲十七便士比上日跌０六二五、遠期不動、仍爲十七便士０六二五、又英美匯價開三元三角九分八份之五、</p>
<h3>厘拆市仍清閑江角高漲分餘</h3>
<p>昨洋厘仍祇早晨一市、做開價格、爲七錢一分三厘一毫二忽半、較前日改少三毫七忽半、做出匯劃票欵五十五萬五千、鈔票支單槪無見聞、銀拆仍爲白借、拆票交易轉賬一百五十餘萬、新交易未詳、錢莊洋公單收解二百三十餘萬、銀公單收解一千零八九十萬、銀劃頭欵收解一百五十餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解八九十萬、銀行洋户往來收解九十餘萬、鈔票進出無聞、銀行銀欵收解外商二三百萬、華商二百餘萬、出倉二十萬、進倉四十萬、小錢莊交易四十餘萬、輔幣江南小洋早市爲六錢三分二厘、較前日頓高一分二厘、交易五千五百角、廣東小洋爲六錢零八厘、較前日改小二厘、交易六萬角、銅元縮二千文、爲四百十千文、</p>
<p>證劵</p>
<h3>債市平和微有參差</h3>
<p>昨華商證券交易所、公債市面、交易尙不寂寞、人心因時局方面、未詳樂觀、漸見虚軟、上午開盤、大都傾向賣出、散户補空有限、價乃由高而低、次盤一八關稅編遣裁兵及一九關稅、均以吃户寥寥、仍無起色、拍一九善後時、三十八號吃進甚湧、市價乃由低而高、二十年關稅及統稅、四十五號多頭加碼、價乃賴以維持、故鹽稅亦隨之續漲三角、結果頗爲平和、計一八關及編遣微漲一二角、餘則跌落二三角、惟遠期鹽稅跌去五角、現貨成交祇五千元、而二十關獨漲一元、成交總數爲三百八十七萬元、</p>
<h3>紐約股市參差不一</h3>
<p>新豐洋行報告、週二紐約股市仍屬呆滯、蓋美國鋼鐵公司於下午行將舉行董事會、討論優先股息問題、投機者於事前不欲從事買賣也、又大通國民銀行宣稱於下星期二、擬將國民電力公司之抵押證券五百五十餘萬元拍賣云、全日成交數共六十六萬股、（美國鋼鐵公司之每季優先股息業經董事會通過、由一元七角五分减爲五角、價格約跌三元、紐約收市價爲六一·五、至消息傳出後、舊金山證券交易所行市約五八元、）</p>

<p>紗花</p>
<h3>海外市氣不振標紗花一跌再跌</h3>
<p>紗市趨疲、跌勢未定、因海外花紗繼續下落、人心衰弱不振、但大部份心理以各鄕農民尙在廢歷年頭中、紗銷未曾發動、以後當有起色、因此對於多頭觀念仍濃、故棉市跌風雖熾、紗市尙堪維持、然世界潮流一致下游、國内經濟如斯衰敗、預料前途、未許樂觀、</p>
<h3>人標步跌半兩</h3>
<p>人標前市開盤、隨外棉而跌七錢、形勢頗虚、二三盤有獲利者抵補、稍稍回漲、各月祇跌一·二·四錢、午後開盤聞某國紗又跌、市况愈疲、各月跌三·四錢、全日成交統計二萬四千包、查賣出椿記一千一百五十包、大昌成一千一百五十包、大昶八百包、德源六百包、益昶七百五十包、買進吉豐二千一百五十包、大孚一千一百包、愼記一千零五十包、信誠六百包、長餘六百五十包、收盤價如下、</p>

<p>棉市跌風日熾、因印美棉市步落、美棉三月份六分陣綫跌破、人心遂現驚慌、且各路皆有存貨、目前視外棉不佳、脫售者愈急、因之市勢頗難、支持、但印美棉市仍有不穏之狀、因消費太滯、又有過剩之風說、此種情形、早誌本報、印棉在市兜售日多、價格較可廉宜、恒豐進印棉五百件云、</p>
<h3>鄭標再降四五錢</h3>
<p>鄭標前市開盤、以外棉趨疲、市氣仍軟、但有一部份扒空、市盤尙平、遠跌一錢、午後市氣又虚、各月跌三錢、全日成交統計九萬三千三百担、查賣出椿記三千一百担、遠大三千二百担、益昶三千八百担、長豐四千六百担、源興昌五千六百担、長和三千九百担、信誠三千九百担、穗隆二千一百担、買進吉豐四千五百担、同興二千一百担、源大一萬零七百担、益豐三千二百担、收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>外棉頻告下跌</h3>

<h3>紅盤米價高半元左右</h3>
<p>｜陰元貨乏獨好元譜｜</p>
<p>（滬南）昨來源三二十號、浦中存積計百十餘號、城鄕店胃尙暢、數計三四千石、包棧胃客商以申地改用新量器後、與津地斛子有許多困難、以致尙在討論中、約於本月十一二日可動辦、而市况較客歲堅硬、蘇同帮及南港青角等米價高四角、杜洋尖亦提一二角、陰元以乏貨獨漲元許、常帮來源未到無市、</p>
<p>（滬北）米業自議定改用新制市斛後、北市行客、有種種手續未妥、致未開斛、雖稍有做開、均未斛出、河下存船及新到約有三十二一號、米數均三千石、各棧存白粳約五六萬石、各廠存尖五萬餘石、羊尖及白元數千石之譜、昨市北帮白粳照去年海斛收盤價加六七角、早稻加四五角、陰變元加二三角、廠機尖、價四四角五分、廠機羊尖加六七角、其餘均見增加、</p>
<h3>客秈跌價暢銷</h3>
<p>價再小一角···閩化獨旺</p>
<p>昨日客秈到頭不旺、因各産地自聞全國流通不需護　費用後、人心向上、均有收囤、故産價反而堅俏、販運難以合劃、但申地有洋米與杜米軋脚、市面一時難好、而河下杜米自昨日起已可流通全國各埠、不需護照等枝節、河下米旣可暢行無阻、則客米去路不免被其傾軋、因湘贛米客均力主早日脫手、已非去冬多主擯守之態度矣、晨間開市後各秈一律貶小一角、價小後閩帮立卽暢辦、本街與囤户亦趁機問訊、市成轉活、統市由閩省福州帮辦去江西機晚一千二百七十包、湘機紅八百包、湘油五百包、又泉州去湘油一千包、本街散户計去湘油一千餘包、紅米三百包、行情各較小一角左右、湖南機油自九元一角七分至八元九角、又機紅米八元七角半至八元六角半、江西機晚八元九角半至八元八角半云、</p>
<h3>標粉起落無常</h3>
<p>｜七月份已循例開拍｜</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上午初疲斷平、以洋麥報價、雖微好幾分、惟因實銷終少問訊、人心不免虚疲、故本月份自五分開價、旋卽低至四分二厘半、爲停市來之最低紀錄、後因客帮微有交易、空户亦有抵補、又復回高至五分二厘半、遠期各月份、因本月份之起伏、開價亦稍見俏、四盤　、因出户不多、本月份人心重好、高至六分二厘半、惟空收盤、則又低落、觀此種盤旋情形、須俟客帮有正式交易時、方有定評也、結果本月份較小二厘半、三月份不動、四月份三一厘半、五月份小二厘半、六月份小五厘、七月份已循例開拍、初價一兩七錢七分二厘半、收盤亦小五厘云、</p>
<h3>期麥步步下游</h3>
<p>七月份開價卽小</p>
<p>昨日麥市交易不旺、惟市價被行客套賣卽疲、午後　小、本月份將有洋麥抵埠、交貨更力、開價已小至三兩　、收市至三兩三錢七分、比前日小七分、三四月縮小二分、　此三日間各月份一律步跌、迄未稍站、三天之跌風亦猛、併計之各小有一錢四分及一錢二三分之　　　七月份　日初次開拍、下午收市亦比　間小去四分、洋麥電訊期現均見微漲、定貨一時繼以妥洽、</p>
<h3>雜糧市疲俏不一</h3>
<p>生仁到積兩厚、因廣帮劃算乏利、致交易勢懈、即有成交、亦取高而殺低、花生本街零户鄕莊緊凑、所以進胃見濃、市况見砌、黃豆祇本街醬配及内地稍動、以致市形帶軟、汕頭甬帮雖有問津、而胃口不大、市難振作、大粒高菜菉豆廣帮已有採辦、小料祇汕厦帮少數成交、</p>
<h3>芝加哥小麥續漲</h3>
<p>週二芝加哥小麥、先因利物浦消息不良而跌、後因冬季小麥估計利於多頭而漲、又三十日成交共一千萬蒲歇爾、茲將三十一日行市列左、</p>

<p>油市</p>
<h3>去歲棉子油廠營業槪况</h3>
<p>上半届合作收效下半届兼營菜子</p>
<p>大有大昌等各盈餘三萬至五六萬</p>
<p>本埠棉子榨油廠、爲數雖不過六七家、而原料需用、向有供不應求之勢、前年子花欠收、出數不旺、棉子更見不敷供應、幸進貨方面、由同業合作、共同設立原料採辦處購辦、價格亦歸該處隨市訂定、故子價不致越軌横跳、而油餅以出數不多、市亦穏定、故上年上半年之油廠營業、雖經滬戰影響、而得能不致十分虧折者、亦同業合作之效果　去秋子花收成頗豐、而新廠恒興泰成立、爲未入會者、與採辦處成對敵地位、緣因該廠股東類多爲浦東軋花廠家、故成立後、浦東棉子、幾爲一網羅盡、按浦東子、佔各廠需用十分之二、因此又貨不應求之苦、廠機均未能　　開足、日　餅　而平　　　　　　　　　　　而已、　足大有　　　　　　　　紛起　做菜子、　以維持工作、此次　　賬、即大有大　等、各　　一萬至五六萬不等、據說　　做菜　而獲利、其餘各廠、僅扯　　　、　　以地位較勝、亦餘三萬元、</p>
<h3>油市紅盤亦漲</h3>
<p>油毛　均有開出</p>
<p>豆油　紅盤昨始開出、市價均依市秤新規交易、各油價較停市前約砌錢外、此乃紅盤　酬交易、故尙熱閙、後情恐難立住、蓋貨酬源湧積也、昨市僅售開三分之一、故後市必須修削、此耳、</p>
<p>清油　亦略漲、昨成交七百擔、價十二兩二錢花壳成交二千餘擔、價四角、以上均本街買進、</p>
<p>毛餅　做開二千擔、價二兩二錢五分、</p>

<h3>金山枝號盤轉升</h3>
<p>金山枝昨日北市廣帮號家首盤業已開出、上牌元枝價爲二十三兩半至二十一兩、普通元枝價爲二十一兩八錢至二十一兩、比去冬升起一兩至五錢之譜、又開出普通元肉五十件、價爲二十二兩八錢、其他建帮號盤尙未開兌云、</p>
<p>糖市</p>
<h3>粗砂糖抛價步跌</h3>
<p>昨日糖市以標金續疲、趨勢轉跌、兼之粗砂白洋行方面二三月份抛價、上下午成交相差一角至五分之多、上午大昌開荷幣四元二角二分半新規、天祥爲四元二角半、沙遜及順全隆均爲四元二角、成交頗多、及至下午永興又開二三月份裝貨三百噸、價爲荷幣四元一角半、故上午各行成進之貨、皆要扣價尙未解决、經此衝動、人心不穏、故公會劃盤二四粗砂白僅劃出數百包、價爲十五兩七錢、比前日跌云七分半、其餘二十號中砂白以及八九號荷赤、雖仍呌原價、均乏受手、致無成交、尙有潮青前後所存號貨、因兌規雖經前日商妥、但潮帮仍須由大會通過、故昨經潮州會館開全體大會追認、至晚始散、今日號盤當開始交易云、</p>

<p>。以其店較多，定價　比較公道。　是要注意　要還價。最好多訪幾家。以資比較。待樣板賣定後。緩付定洋。先剪小樣。約於次日加　。以便至其他店家取樣比較。㈡看樣板時。　要認清爲誰家的樣板。可持小樣到該處訊問。（電話亦可）詢問時必先問樣板碼　　折。現錢幾扣。於是此衣面需多少錢。立可算出雖欲欺　。自不再　。益裁縫量尺寸。往往多算料作。從中取利。　　做一套西裝。實在需料二碼七五。　一定說要三碼。精明之買客。不必由其代買。自己去買料子。最多買二碼八角。略加放頭足已。釐裁縫代買。旣要賺錢。又要賺料。　層進益。買客就兩重吃虧。㈣如以自己買料。爲麻煩。亦呆到小西門·大新街·吳淞路一帶去買現成貨。因該處範圍小。開銷省。故生意較他處爲遷就。雖工作略遜一　。則應特殊差别。而其價則便宜多多。但仍以謹網察看爲要。</p>
<h3>大衣</h3>
<p>西裝大衣。當然在西裝店　　去做　合宜。因其式樣做工。較之其他大衣作塲爲優美。做中裝大衣。爲要經濟。可至大新街·棋盤街·吳淞路·小西門一帶置辦。價格比較便宜。然聞價雖廉。仍需還價。大約有數元上下。最好多訪數家。以免便宜之中再有吃虧。價目講妥後。講明裏子與襯頭爲何種貨色。裏子爲緞子。抑或駱駝絨。兩者貨身高低不一。故須愼爲選擇。襯頭以黑炭襯爲最上乘。倘不講明。必用寗波姜山襯。再則用法西襯不要用裏布襯。（有等店家不規矩。定時說法西襯。製時改用夏布襯及蔴袋布等。）袖裏必須眞　　。馬　襯價格。眞假相差懸殊。眞貨每碼售洋二元。冲貨祇售六角。及一切講明成交後。均需取樣。（注意）。衣料之樣更需稍大。以便衣成對樣。否則則有時對照不明。爲店家作弄了去。無從耕　。倘自己買料交裁縫去做。工錢及零件每件計洋十三四元。卽可辦到。（裏子襯頭袋布鈕子等均在内）當剪買大衣面子時。必須算準自己的長短尺寸。缺則不能補。多則爲裁縫好處。亦不值得。例如身長三尺六七寸者可剪大衣呢二碼八角。袍子穿三尺八九寸者。可剪三碼。四尺以外。則須三碼一瓜篤。（卽二角半）此均是目下最新式的奔褲袖推算。若古式圓袖弄。尙可省一二角料子。</p>
<h3>尺碼</h3>
<p>量呢絨疋頭碼尺。同業所用。大半均自己彷製。但必要時。仍以德記·華記·天佑碼尺爲憑。三十六英寸計一碼。每碼分十角。每角卽三英寸又六分。合計中央爲二寸五分半。二角半。西人稱爲一瓜篤（Quarter）七角半爲三瓜篤。足裁尺十二寸七分半。就是半碼。（但呢絨同業往往謂二尺六寸爲一碼。其實示折人之九十八尺所量者也·）二尺五寸半卽成一碼。碼尺内尙有一二五·二五·三七五·六二五·七五等之别。</p>

<h3>白雪的消融（二）</h3>
<p>— 許傑</p>
<p>我敲一水面，牠僅僅露出一些白花，牠幾乎比石板還要堅硬。我摇一摇水缸，水缸的底裏，也没有半點活動的流水，而那此水魚呢，有的是凍反白了之後，才被凝固着，有的是正如平時游水時的姿態一樣，靜靜的，不動的凝在半空，有的呢，牠的小尾巴還是灣曲着的，表示要轉向顯出一些努力的姿態；但是，一切是被凝固了，是被凍結了。而且，一切都清清楚楚的，透明的陳在我的眼前，使我看得清清楚楚。我忽然傷心起來。我好像感覺到我自己也被凍結在這冰的世界中一樣，我哭了起來，我很傷心的哭了起來。</p>
<p>這一種情形，我想便是你們没有經騐得到，也會想像出一些大槪吧！諸君，這一晌天氣，我們的肉體和靈魂，也正是這樣凝凍着在呢！</p>
<p>你且看一看這幾天來的天氣。因然，在前幾天，我們的　前也曾在滴　，在一滴一點的融着雪水，我們到頗覺得有些生氣。但是，這幾天的情形，却明確放在我們的眼前，我們　前的雪水，不是在白天，固然融了一些，滴了幾滴，到了晚上，又不是重新凍結起來，而且在雪上再加上白雪嗎？</p>
<p>在前幾天，因爲還有人在生火取煖，有人在無聊談天，甚至因爲還有人生活着尙没有停止了他的呼吸的關係，所以在白天裏，還能夠滴溜着幾點表示着這白雪不久便要崩潰的預兆的水。但是，現在，便是還有人在生火，有人在呼吸，也不能使那嚴厲的冰雪消失分毫。這樣下去。你不會推想到將來連火都不會　來的呢，你不會推想到連你的呼吸都會被凝凍住，再也不能自自在在的吐氣嗎？</p>
<p>固然，我們知道，解救我們這嚴冬的厄運的春與温熱，是遲早要到來的，但是，在這樣的肉體與靈魂都被凝凍在冰雪的世界裏的今日，却是無論如何，一分一刻，都是很難忍耐的。并且，在這樣的遑急的等待春的到來的日子中，我們會特别的覺得這日子的難以挨過，甚至會疑心到春的永不到來。朋友，你請試想，在我那小魚雪中凍死的幾隻小魚，牠在灣着尾巴的掙扎的姿勢中，牠在舒着胸鱔平均着肢體的游閒的姿態中，牠可曾想到春天畢竟會到來的一回事否？</p>
<p>這是事實吧，卽使春天是眞的有一日到來，但是，我們現在的生命，却無論如何也挨不到春天，那便怎麽樣呢！在你自己的生命結束了以後，這春天方才到來，你相信這春天是到的呢，還是始終没有到來呢！</p>
<p>融雪是比落雪冷的。何况現在的雪，是融了又落，融了又落，一直到現在，是雪上中冰，冰上加雪的整個凝凍起來了呢！</p>
<p>這樣的天氣，誠然是極端嚴厲的，但是，你老等着，老是被冰結在這冰凍的世界中，連呼吸都被凝凍住了不得呼吸，總也不是適當的事。我們中國人是有一句古訓的，呌做「各人自掃門前雪」。我想，我們自己的門前的掃雪的工作，只有讓自己來做了吧！我們還要做些掃雪的工作呢，我們要把自己的呼吸舒展一下。</p>
<p>啊，「落雪不如融雪冷」，好嚴厲的天氣啊！</p>

<h3>蕭伯納與高爾斯華綏</h3>
<p>— 郁達夫</p>
<p>我們正在預備着熱烈歡迎那位長臉預言家的蕭老的當中，却不幸又接到了去年諾貝爾奬金獲得者高爾斯華綏的赴告。蕭今年七十六歲。高爾斯華綏今年六十五歲了。</p>
<p>照理說來，六十五歲，也並不算是夭壽，但這位由法學家出身的英國上流社會的精密記錄者，若是不死的話，以後說不定總還有幾册巨著出來，來報告我們以英國上流社會的動摇與變遷。高爾斯華綏在文學上的功績，不單是福些以脫家的史傳，與銀盒，鬭爭，正義，羣衆諸劇本，可埀不朽，就以他當一八九三年在南海旅行的途中，發見了海軍作家康拉特的一事業來說，也該在英文學史上占一席地位了。雖然是比較上流出身，但他那始終爲人道而立言，對社會下針砭</p>
<p>的態度，就是在時代不同，潮流激轉的現在，我們也不得不加以十二分的尊敬。</p>
<p>反過來說蕭，他老先生對社會的態度就不同了。初聽聽似乎只在說玩而不當正經的死話，但閉目一想，或笑後心靈一轉，則立刻就可以發見這位長臉老人的嬉笑怒駡，那一句不是准對着社會癥結的强心針？善哉，麥克開勃（JosephMcCabe）之言，他批評蕭說··「他並不說警句奇語，但他本身却是一句警句。他是最有道德的不道德家，最不利己的爲我主義的說敎者，最潔己的十誡否定人，最嚴肅的幽默利世德。』（ThegravestHumoris）這不是很適當蕭的評語麽？</p>
<p>有一次有一位以美貎馳名歐美的女優曾對他說··『蕭先生，你若和我結了婚，生下一個小孩，相貎像我而頭腦像你，那這孩子豈不是世上最美麗最有思想的人了麽。』蕭說··『萬一相貎像了我，頭腦像了你，那還了得！』</p>
<p>諸如此類的妙語，在蕭的七十六年中間，不知發放了多少。曾記得他到俄國去參觀的時候，史太林也不得不認作馬克斯主義的後生小子，因爲他說，我研究馬克斯，是遠在列寗之先。當時歡洲各資本主義的國家，正在宣傳蘇俄强制作工的違反人道，而蕭却對俄國人說··『我願意歐美都有這種非人道的現像發生，否則那些成千成萬的失業工人，那裏會有出路呢？』</p>
<p>在我們中國，幸喜還有一位魯迅先生｜可以和蕭伯納對對。片語殺人，人家都在駡他是紹興師爺的故技，但蕭伯納總不至於是藎山人罷？一九三二月一日。</p>
<h3>錫滬途中速寫</h3>
<p>— 黃曾榮</p>
<p>「好望見烟了！」於是站上底人們都似乎服了一帖興奮劑，打着呵欠，伸伸腰，各自提了自己底東西，準備着將近的一翻擠軋。女人們還在詛咒着火車底誤時，使她們等夠了兩個鐘頭。</p>
<p>警察也開始工作了··他們提着木棍，站在鐵軌兩旁的月台邊，警告人們走進些。間或逢到一兩個不識相的鄕下人，哼！那木棍就會加到他們底身上··並且說上　句不吉利的話··「尋死嗎？」</p>
<p>火車衝進了月台。好容易才擠上三等車厢，可是人已站得滿滿的了。有一位西裝先生，倒很舒適地横着。據旁邊人口中說··這位先生是從鎭江上來的，也許是爲着「公事」，或者說不定是一個「要人」哩｜不是嗎？他底頭下，還枕着一個「公事皮包」！所以大家都不敢去和他計較··因爲知道··「公事」終是「公事」「要人」終是「要人」呵！</p>
<p>火車將近滸墅關，查票來了，跟着兩個憲兵，倒也威風凛凛。哦！中國底憲兵，就祇夠跟着人查查票罷了！</p>
<p>查票的查到那位躺着的先生面前時，裝着十二分莊嚴的神氣，呌他起來，西裝先生當然不會屈服。查票的道理倒還充足，他說··</p>
<p>「你不起來，你可要補兩張票子。」的確，他簡直是佔了三個人底位子了，西裝先生大槪因了不願補票底原故，終於坐了起來。不過，爲着保留自己底面子起見，當查票的去了之後，他望着他底後影，駡了一聲··「他媽的」。這當然是怪查票的不睜開眼，不把他這「公事皮包」放在眼裏。</p>
<p>火車裏多難受！烟霧瀰漫，眞要悶窒死人。有一位不認識的先生說··</p>
<p>「吓··吸烟眞不衛生呀！」</p>
<p>但是吸烟的人都向他横着白眼。</p>
<p>火車過南翔一直駛去！我心中當然比較欣慰些··不過，四周的烟霧，混着百多人所呼出的炭氣底鬱塞，更覺緊張，又使我感到暫時的不快。還好！上海快到了！</p>
<p>上海終於到了！呵！終於到了！我很迅速地從車厢裏跳出，好像被赦了的囚徒。</p>
<h3>模範的集合市場</h3>
<p>— 土人</p>
<p>從胡蘿葡起，各色各樣的東西都買得到的，一座玻璃宮似的集合市場，去年十月初頭在莫斯科開張了。這座庥合市場狠出色，有一間育兒所，進去買東西的人可以把自家的孩子們委託在裏邊。有一間休息室，有飯店，有通風設備，有衛生的飮用泉，還有避火的裝置，只要把那副狠技術地裝置在屋頂和墻壁裏的灑水器龍頭一轉，就可以使這大建築物裏的任何部份不至於受其他部份的連累了。</p>
<p>估計在莫斯科開幕的這第一個模範的集合市場，一時能容八千位顧客。八十一個貨攤專賣集合農場和國家農場的食物品。一條三百米突長的櫃檯裏賣各種農民的製造品，從食料到刺繡的勞工服裝。另外有二百米長的櫃檯就專門經營衣服，鞋子，織物，以及巧小玲瓏的器皿。一位醫生時常到場。獸醫和農學專家們要審查出賣的一切食物。</p>
<p>這新奇的建築的正面，裝飾着一個男子和一個婦人的塑像，斜倚在一隻倒翻的籃子上，從那隻籃子裏不斷地流出無限的大批園藝生産物。在這大建築物的前面是一片草地，有花園和噴水泉。</p>
<p>烏列安尼斯基，負責建築的人，說，從七月二十日起開始建築，平均每天有四百五十個人動着手。建築的計畫，從開始建築以來，已經有所更改，所以費用也就從預算七十五萬盧布增加到近一百二十萬盧布，更延長預定時間，纔完成了這偉大的工作。</p>
<p>長篇創作</p>
<h3>時代與愛的歧路（續稿）</h3>
<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>「稍爲翻翻吧了，没有什麽研究。林先生，你是喜歡讀小說的，是不是？」</p>
<p>「我想創作。因爲藝術是苦悶的象徵。······所以經廚川白村一提倡，便有人趕快輸了入來。」</p>
<p>「但是，林先生，在現代，那已經不是時髦的Slogan了。」</p>
<p>她說着，微偏着頭，很有趣般的在笑。</p>
<p>「啊，啊。」</p>
<p>他感着自己的臉熱了。他想問她什麽呌做Slogan，但又覺問了後，會給她看輕，只是「啊，啊」的反應了一下，專等她再講下去。</p>
<p>「林先生，你想文藝該怎樣下定義才好？」</p>
<p>「文藝是社會的反影。」</p>
<p>他很繁捷地回答了她。他想，這一定可以博得她的外在的喝采，和内在的欽佩了。但他心裏仍然有些自愧。因爲這個定義又是他於前幾天晚上，才從那幾位革命文學者的總發行所批發過來的。現在想向她零碎地售一點出去。</p>
<p>「哈，哈，哈！那，比剛才進步了一點。不過，······」</p>
<p>他想，這眞是意外了。「文藝是社會的反影」，除此以外，還有更時髦的定義麽？他心裏有些不輸服了。他下了决心問她了。</p>
<p>「那麽，還有更時髦的定義麽？」</p>
<p>他故裝鎭靜地笑着問她。</p>
<p>「嘻，嘻，嘻。·····林先生，······」</p>
<p>他這趟凝神靜氣地想從這位鶴子夫人認眞地輸入一點智識了。</p>
<p>「······這是什麽茶？眞香得可愛呢！」</p>
<p>「豈有些理！」</p>
<p>他在肚子裏駡了一聲後，很不高興地同答了她三個字，「鐵觀音」。</p>
<p>「眞美麗的名字，藝術的哟，嘻，嘻，嘻。」</p>
<p>「你剛才說的文藝的定義，應當是怎樣的，才算最時髦呢？」</p>
<p>「你還在想那件事？算了吧林先生。我也不甚明白。我是由日本的很平凡的，婦人公論，雜誌裏面看見的，左翼作家對於文藝所下的定義是，勞働的呼聲哟。</p>
<p>「那還不是社會的反影之一種？」</p>
<p>「那不對哟，林先生。雖然是社會的反影，但反動的文藝應當除外哟。這是最前綫的文藝的定義。不過我不讚成這樣偏狹的定義。大槪我們還没有把捉住意德沃羅基吧。」</p>
<p>海泉想，對了，對了。意德沃羅基！這就是那天晚上陳華民先生向自己講演文藝理論時，常常說及的名詞，自己還不甚明白呢。何以鶴子夫人也懂得這些名堂。他怔住了，半響没有回話。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>爲吃排頭强</h3>
<p>— 辯</p>
<p>昨天「吾」君談北平大學吃排頭，意猶未盡，我再補充其說，日人旣未打到平津，而北平各大學，妄自驚擾，頗有逃考與提前放假等情事，這種現象，的確不該，非但表示我民衆與當局懦怯的心理，使敵人更張其進攻的氣燄，而另一方面，最高學府，旣如此現象，則人心愈覺動摇，而社會秩序，亦幾不能維持，北平各大學之吃排頭應該而又加應該。</p>
<p>但是我近日看看報紙中的電報，前日有</p>
<p>「故宮古物裝竣準備南運各團體仍决予反對」云云。</p>
<p>昨日電報有</p>
<p>「外交部部電平檔案保管處將重要檔案運洛保存」云云．</p>
<p>這樣一來，不免使我疑惑起來，當局一方面不准學生逃考不准學校當局提前放假而另一方面則將古物檔案裝箱南運的確古物檔案頗爲重要未雨綢繆計應該南運以防不測難道學生的生命財産半文不值的麽假定爲欲鎭靜起見自己先未鎭靜怎能使人硬欲鎭靜呢這種事情，豈非絶對予盾．</p>
<p>我以爲無論任何事情，先要有一貫的步調，所謂「無諸己然後非諸人，」又曰「爲政不在多言，顧力行如何」現在國難如平。津謡諑必然蜂起。政府先應有安定大局的方法。與抗禦敵人的計劃。使人心不致動摇。方爲正當辦法。若旣無禦敵之而欲使一般人强爲鎭靜。已屬難能的事况且自己先不能鎭靜如何還可以責人之鎭靜呢。</p>
<p>故有刻薄者之言曰，當局祇重古物。不重人民此語雖是過於刻薄。但據事實言之。則此語之來或非無因也。</p>

<h3>菜和飯的變化</h3>
<p>— 林霞</p>
<p>呌菜，吃飯，誰人不會！一告斷絶便要死亡，究竟吃下去又香，又鮮的菜和飯，都變成什麽呢？撒出來的，却是又黃，又臭的糞和尿呢？本刋的讀者，對於自己本體内時時刻刻發生的菜和飯的變化，也許有很多人不明白的吧！</p>
<p>我們吃的菜和飯，種類多極。但是就牠所含的營養素，却只有三類··</p>
<p>第一類···炭水化合物···便是各種含有粉質和糖質的食品如米，麥，山芋。</p>
<p>第二類···蛋白質···便是蛋白，豆腐和肉類的食品。</p>
<p>第三類···脂肪···便是各種油和脂類的食品。</p>
<p>這三類東西，雖然各種菜，飯裏，多多少少，都包含着，但是不經過磨碎及溶解水中，變成可以透入血管内面的液體，我們身體内，還不能受用哩！</p>
<p>所以菜和飯，必經過五種變化··</p>
<p>第一···要用齒咬斷，磨碎；</p>
<p>第二···要用口内的唾液，將菜，飯内的炭水化合物，醱酵變成可透性的糖液；</p>
<p>第三···嚥下去，更用胃裏的胃液，把菜，飯内的蛋白質變成一種配布通（Peptone）</p>
<p>第四···到腸裏，先由膽囊裏分泌來的膽汁，把菜，飯裏的脂和油，變成可透性的乳化脂肪。</p>
<p>第五···更由脺（一名胰，上海人呌夾肝）分泌來的脺液，把菜，飯内没有變完的三種營養素，再變成糖液，配布通，乳化脂肪！</p>
<p>已經變化的糖液，配布通，和乳化脂肪，便從口，胃，腸的黏膜，透入血管内，隨着血液，周流全身。更發生兩種變化··</p>

<h3>死要面子活受罪</h3>
<p>編者先生··我是一個獨子，没有兄弟和姊妹，只有一個妹妹。十八歲的時候，我的父親就棄其慈母愛妻孤兒弱女而長逝；其時我尙在舊制中學二年級修業。當我父在世時，也是個小小官員，所入尙稱不惡。不過他生性豪爽，大有「常不使有餘」之慨。所以他身後的境况，實情是非常蕭條。在父親棄養的翌年，祖母因爲思念愛子的緣故，憂憤成疾，竟也追尋她愛子於泉下。一切喪中的事情，母親因爲要維持門面，竟一絲不肯减省。她一方面張羅這喪中的費用，一方面籌劃我們兄妹兩人的學費，還要維持開門七件事，困難至於極點。七年前，我在本埠某中學畢業，考入國營甘事務局當個中級職員。每月約有百元左右的收入，而且位置也很有保障。母親見我在社會上已可立足，在次年的新年裏，就把全家重擔交給我。她交我一疊賬簿，經詳細查閱的結果，知道負債約一千八百餘金。考其所以致此的緣故，大半是因爲要維持面子而化去的。我個人雖不贊成這種辦法，但也深知這是社會上的通病，所以對於母親非常諒解，只有感謝她數年來支撑門户的苦心，毫没有怨恨的念頭。接着就閙着我的婚姻問題，據母親的意思，很想在本鄕趕辦，顯輝顯輝。我當時因爲前債尙未清了的緣故，主張非從儉不可。幸喜對方的家長，是老世交，知道我的處境，事事原諒。就在我的職業地，媽媽虎虎的舉行，所費尙不及七百金。此後我就立行節儉，清理債務；直至最近，方始告一段落。這七年當中，雖則各事省儉，但我對於妹妹的學費，却並不吝惜。我深知道這是她前途幸福的基礎。今年夏季，她算來可以高中畢業；她的示婚夫｜本鄕的一個世家子｜也就定於今冬結婚。於是我們的問題又開始了！據母親的意思，終要略具規模；免得妹子將來受氣，同時也不致丢了自己的門面。但是這輕輕「略具規模」四個字，算來也非二千金不辦。我自己一想，過去的七年，忙的無非完全是債務。現在雖則債已拔清，可是兒女成行，生活程度日高；倘使貿然答應，這二千餘元的債務，怕不又要夠我十三四年的受累嗎？人生幾何，能掙錢的時間，最多也不過二三十年。这樣一想；我就婉言拒絶，主張從儉，一切開支，以七百金爲度。因爲這是我結婚時費用的總數。我自問總可以對得起人了。那知老母聽了，竟大動其氣。很嚴厲地說，「當你祖母的喪中，我是一個寡婦，你父親又没有積蓄，尙且張羅得體體面面；至今我家的門面，賴以不墮。現在你是一個有職業的男子，所入在中人以上，難道好意思丢臉嗎？」我聽了當時不敢回答。但是至今想想，舉債嫁妹，似乎太苦，而且事實上也是不必；因爲我的未來的妹夫，他是很富有的呀。犧牲我一身的幸福，只落得人家的一笑，也未免太愚；但是母命難違，又怎樣呢？（下略）許樹高謹上</p>
<p>×　×　×　×</p>
<p>編者按··中國人眞太講面子不顧事實，所以「死要面子活受罪」的矛盾生活，到處可以看到。從上面許君的來信看來，也可以發現不合經濟面理之點有二。㈠許君的父親，收入尙稱不惡；但是結果毫無積蓄。雖說豪爽，但這種到手就用的辦法，也是不合的。結果弄得他賢妻愛子，受無量數的痛若。</p>
<p>㈡許君的母親，在她婆婆喪中，不顧實力，硬爭塲面。雖則福會上舉她能「代盡子職」，「克盡孝道」；但這種忍痛要好的辦法，終究是不合的。所以結果害許君受長期（七年）的痛苦。現在她還想要她兒子爲了嫁妹子的事情，也這樣趕，眞可謂執迷不悟了。</p>
<p>但是許君個人的已往，確有值得我們佩服的三點。</p>
<p>㈠他在發現母親當家的時候，就築了一千八百金債臺之後，能原諒她的苦衷；毫不怨恨。人子之道，至此已可告無愧了。</p>
<p>㈡他在極困難的當中，能繼續不斷的供給妹妹的學費，顧全她畢生的幸福。兄長的義務，也可算盡了。</p>
<p>㈢他在結婚的時候，能打破環境，極力節省。現在嫁妹子的時候，雖則萬分困難，也情願拿出與他結婚時所費同樣的金額來贈與妹子。亦不能不算慷慨了。</p>
<p>我們勸許君毅然照自己的主張做去，這是不差的。老母的面前，應當俟其快樂的時候，婉言解說。愛子之心，人所共有，諒解想也不難的。</p>
<p>要是作繭自縛，那末人生最寳貴的中年時代，就此斷送；而且說不定要像你的父親一樣，貽妻子以無窮的痛苦呢！</p>
<p>我們還勸許君的母親，終要懺悔因爲已往的失策，已經使兒子十分爲難；不要再固執成見，使兒子永無出頭之日。</p>
<p>許君的妹妹，也應該顧到兄長的苦處，念他七年來敎充的恩惠。在母親前面，力爲解勸。我想受過中等敎育的女子，這一點當然可以瞭解；而且這辦法最能使她母親回心轉意，因爲她主張闊綽的緣故，一半雖爲維持門面，一半還是怕她女兒日後受氣。</p>
<p>末了我還得大聲疾呼，勸許君的妹夫與他的家長以及一般旁人，趕快變換他們的觀念，實行朱夫子所謂「娶妻求淑女，勿計厚奩」的遺訓。</p>

<h3>詩禮人家（九續）</h3>
<p>— 汪仲賢</p>
<p>（五）死了人發大纯帖子</p>
<p>夏太太不一定要靠丈夫寄了家用來才能度日，不過每月寄慣了的錢，突然停止，心裏總有些氣不服，寫信去責問仲南，連搪塞的空函都不覆一封，這一氣眞是非同小可！她的舊病復發了，氣胚頂住在胸前，一連幾天没有下去，請遍了中西醫生，服藥打針，毫無功效；但見她兩眼上翻，白多黑少。剛發病的兩天，還能像殺猪般的喚疼，後來竟無力呼號，氣喘得像廿五哩賽跑的運動員將到終點一般，喉喘口還有一堆痰不上不下的壅塞着！</p>
<p>阿麗看着形色不對，命老胡一連打了三四通急電到仲南任上去，回電來說，「太太身故，請伯東大老爺主持喪務，開銷從儉，」人還没有死咧，他也經先替死人打起算盤來了！這個回電如果給太太看，正像一道促她歸天的催命符，老胡與阿麗商量藏匿過了。</p>
<p>夏太太自知病入膏盲，難望全愈，便將茂生與阿麗喚到床前，氣息僅屬的說··</p>
<p>「茂生是我一番心血將他扶養大的。我死之後，只怕他在那婦人手裏要受苦，阿麗雖是丫頭，我一向將你當女兒看待，我現在索性認了你做寄女吧，那末，茂生就是你的兄弟了，以後你須要另眼照應他，不要讓那婦人欺侮，我暗中自會護佑你們的！你服侍了我一場，這幾件首飾算是給你的酬勞。」</p>
<p>說着，她在枕頭邊一個首飾箱裏，隨意撈了幾件首飾給阿麗，阿麗涙汪汪接着，安慰了太太一番，太太又命茂生以後改口，稱阿麗爲阿姐，稱桑司務爲姐夫。</p>
<p>又挨了三五天，夏太太竟實行壽終正寢了！由大老爺伯東，四老爺季此出面料理喪事，夏家子孫繁殖，穿孝服送喪的人却也不少。那個抱牌位的孝子，族中人對於茂生的資格問題，曾有人提出過異議，後來經伯東解釋道··「仲南未曾正式立嗣，茂生雖非親生，但二房没有否認表示，别人不便代他作主，」所以這個蔴衣主角仍由茂生擔任表演，因爲這個問題不曾解决，夏太太死後竟未發訃聞。</p>
<p>死的消息傳到仲南任上，夏二老爺廣發大紅喜柬，擇吉宴賓客。死了人發大紅帖子，斷無此理！有人將他的喜帖打開一觀，才恍然大悟，原來那帖子上寫的是··</p>
<p>謹詹於月之某日爲斷室艾若華女士行廟見大禮恭請</p>
<p>闔第光臨　夏仲南率女黛秋鞠躬</p>
<p>這是一個小老婆扶正的請帖，倒也說得冠冕堂皇，不過夏南是江南人，在他做官的任上並無夏氏宗祠，這個廟見禮只能學皇帝時代的望闕遥叩了，夏仲南的具名下還拖着一個油瓶小姐，這是暗示着艾若華女士也是「二婚頭小姐」了。這張請帖的起草員也算煞費苦心哩！</p>
<p>艾若華女士的命運眞不佳！她製好了一套富麗堂皇的結婚禮服，預備到了吉日大出風頭的，不幸喜事尙未臨門，禍殃却從天外飛來了！原來那時省裏的政局已發生了變化，主持省政的首腦得信較早，已溜入租界，發出下野的通電，仲南管理全省財政，未經過交待手續，勢難脫身，他聽得長官溜之大吉，也想一跑了事，無奈得信太遲，已有人監視着他的行動，如果冒昧離省，難免要當塲出醜，被人扣留起來，那就太下面子了！（未完）</p>

<h3>Britain's Obvious Partiality to Japan Makes an Impartial League of Nations Report Unlikely</h3>
<p>If the Puppet Manchukuo Organization is Ultimately Allowed to Be Recognized,</p>
<p>Our Country Will Have No Choice But to Withdraw from the League of Nations</p>
<p>The Second Reading of the Draft Report is Complete; the Suggestions Section is Not Yet Involved</p>
<p>Most of the Twelve Conclusions Adopt the Lytton Report</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The first three chapters of the report drafted by the Nine-Power Committee have been completed, and the suggestions section is also about to be completed. It is said that due to Britain's partiality to Japan, the important section on not recognizing the puppet organization will definitely not be included. This is not only contrary to our country's policy, but also violates the League of Nations resolution of March 11th last year. The government has decided to reject this and powerful figures argue that if the League of Nations adopts such a report, it will expose its inability to uphold justice and fairness. Since we have no expectations, we will resolutely withdraw from the League of Nations. (1st, Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Nine-Member Committee has not yet proposed the issue of recognizing "Manchukuo," but when discussing suggestions tomorrow (Wednesday), it may be brought up. However, it will only be a brief discussion, as the Nineteen-Member Special Committee must issue instructions to the committee. The Nineteen-Member Special Committee may not be able to meet before the end of this week, as the League of Nations Administrative Council and the main leaders of the Disarmament Conference will be meeting this week. (31st, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Although the drafting committee appointed by the Nineteen-Nation Committee met for a long time today, the first part of the report to be submitted to the League of Nations Extraordinary Assembly is not yet complete. The drafting committee has many members, and the drafting work is extremely complicated. Every member wants to participate, and new amendments are proposed from time to time, both in terms of content and form. Therefore, the committee's task is very difficult. A prominent person attending the meeting told this agency's reporter that when the report is finalized in the future, it may be difficult to express a clear opinion, as public opinion expects. The drafting committee will meet again tomorrow morning. The most important chapter of the report, the section containing suggestions, has not yet begun to be discussed. (31st, Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Second Reading of the Draft Report Completed</h3>
<p>(Geneva) According to reliable sources tonight, the Nine-Member Committee has completed the second reading of the draft report. All points, including difficult issues such as boycotts and self-defense, have been fully discussed and agreed upon. The committee met for three and a half hours this afternoon. It was initially reported that there was little progress, but it was later learned that most of the work was completed. Each article of the draft report was studied in detail. The committee decided to meet again tomorrow, Wednesday, to consider the draft proposed by Rice, the representative of the Irish Free State, and other minor details, and will begin to study the issue of suggestions. What the committee has agreed upon must of course be confirmed by the Nineteen-Member Special Committee and approved by the League of Nations General Assembly. Therefore, the current draft is still subject to modification in the future. As far as the Nine-Member Committee is concerned, they criticize boycotts and do not recognize the self-defense doctrine proposed by Japan. It is reported that the committee has agreed on the following points tonight:</p>
<h3>Contents of the First Three Sections of the Draft</h3>
<p>The first is a preface, about six lines long, reporting the reasons for transferring the work of the League of Nations under Article 15, Section 4 of the League Covenant. The first section of the report itself is quite complex, containing the first eight chapters of the Lytton Report, with the addition of consular reports and the development of the situation up to the present day. The second section discusses the history of the Sino-Japanese dispute from the Mukden Incident of September 1931, interspersed with reference materials on the Three Eastern Provinces, intended to give readers a proper understanding. The third section contains twelve conclusions, mostly adopted from the Lytton Report: 1. Explains the relationship between the Three Eastern Provinces and China, and the relationship between the Three Eastern Provinces and Japan. 2. Confirms that the Three Eastern Provinces are part of China, but in fact enjoy autonomous status. 3. Mentions the large increase in the Chinese population in the Three Eastern Provinces in recent years. 4. Explains that Japan also has rights in the Three Eastern Provinces, such as leased territories and the South Manchuria Railway, and states that Japan's special position is bound to create tension when Chinese nationalism develops. 5. Confirms that China needs foreign assistance in the transitional state in order to achieve success. 6. Mentions boycotts, stating that boycotts are inflammatory actions and a cause of tension between China and Japan, but boycotts after the September 18th Incident were retaliatory in nature against military action. 7. Declares that both sides did not accept the opportunity for arbitration. 8. Mentions the difficult issue of self-defense, stating that the Japanese actions on the night of September 18th cannot be considered legitimate self-defense. In any case, the claim of self-defense cannot exempt a country from the obligations under Article 12 of the International Covenant. China can also claim self-defense, but China has always abided by the scope of the League Covenant. In this section, the draft report quotes the Lytton Report's statement that the Japanese actions were not legitimate self-defense. 9. Declares that the independence of Manchuria was not a naturally occurring movement, and states that there were many political elements in the Japanese military activities. 10. Explains that a vast area of land, undoubtedly belonging to China, has been forcibly seized and separated from China. 11. Explains that Japan recognized "Manchukuo" after the Lytton Report was written. 12. Explains that although both sides were responsible for the situation before the September 18th Incident, the events that occurred after September 18th must not be blamed on China. (31st, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Suggestions Section Not Discussed</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Today's one-hour meeting of the Nine-Member Committee has concluded the handling of the first three sections of the draft report. The committee did not discuss suggestions, leaving this issue to the next meeting of the Nineteen-Member Special Committee. The special committee may meet on Friday. The upper committee had little essential work this morning, as the main points of the proposed amendments had been included in yesterday's draft. The wording of the conclusions has been finalized and can be printed to form a concrete draft. Although the first and second sections have been completed as far as the Nine-Member Committee is concerned, the Nineteen-Member Special Committee may make final modifications when it meets. Twenty percent of Geneva residents are suffering from the flu. Vichy, a key member of the League of Nations Secretariat's political department, has also contracted the disease and is unable to work. He is an expert familiar with the case, which has delayed the completion of the report. Therefore, the first two sections of the report, which contain the historical events of the case, will be submitted to the Nineteen-Member Special Committee in an unrevised form.</p>
<h3>South Irish Amendment Rejected</h3>
<p>Few of the amendments proposed by Rice, the representative of South Ireland, were adopted, as some of them were already included in the report, while others were rejected. The wording of the first two sections is unlikely to cause major controversy, as the text is purely descriptive in nature. Due to Vichy's illness, it is currently uncertain whether the Nineteen-Member Special Committee can meet on Friday or Saturday. However, it is expected that the special committee may discuss suggestions on Friday and the entire report on Saturday. The fact that the conclusion has been agreed upon unanimously is an important step forward. However, the biggest point of conflict is naturally focused on suggestions, especially the "Manchukuo" issue. This is truly a great undertaking for the League of Nations' negotiating skills.</p>
<h3>Large Countries Exert Pressure on Small Countries</h3>
<p>The current trend of various small countries is to strongly advocate for a clear statement of non-recognition of "Manchukuo." The attitude of the German representative also clearly leans in this direction, although the Germans have not publicly acknowledged it. Small countries have this opinion, while large countries are willing to handle this issue with more diplomatic means. It is expected that a compromise solution can be reached, as all parties believe that there cannot be a question of recognition. This move is tantamount to criticizing Japan's recognition of "Manchukuo," even if the wording is veiled. However, it is still unknown whether the Japanese government can accept it. Geneva's general opinion anticipates that the Japanese government will express a moderate attitude and will not want to react violently to this kind of tactful disagreement, leading to a break with the League of Nations. (1st)</p>
<h3>British Ambassador to Japan Visits Japanese Foreign Minister Uchida</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) British Ambassador Lindley visited Foreign Minister Uchida at 5:00 PM today to inquire about the Japanese Foreign Ministry's countermeasures against the League of Nations. Foreign Minister Uchida, in addition to handing the outline of the instructions to representative Matsuoka to the British ambassador for forwarding to the British Foreign Secretary, also expressed the following opinions: Regarding the issue of denying the independence of the puppet organization, it is best to hope that the League of Nations can make further concessions, otherwise the so-called means of reconciliation will be impossible to implement. As for invoking Article 15, Section 4, the Japanese government is prepared to wait quietly for the content of the report before deciding on its course of action. However, if the content of the recommendation is unacceptable to Japan, the Japanese government will not hesitate to resolutely withdraw from the League of Nations. (1st, China United Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>Secret Understanding Between Britain and Japan</h3>
<p>Neither Side Has Expressed Denial</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At the beginning of last month, this agency published a report on the secret understanding between Britain and Japan based on American sources. The British Consulate in Beijing recently sent a letter questioning the source. In its reply, this agency stated that in addition to describing the source, it reiterated that if the British Consulate could formally deny the secret agreement, this agency would be happy to publish it. To this day, it has still not replied with a denial, and the British government has not denied it either. Moreover, in a dispatch from the Japanese Dentsu News Agency's special correspondent in Geneva on January 29th, there is also the statement that the British Foreign Secretary will certainly implement a more friendly attitude towards the Manchuria issue if Japan withdraws its troops from Shanghai. This shows that the theory of a secret agreement between Britain and Japan is indeed not without foundation, and the friendly relations between China and Britain over the past decade will be greatly affected. (1st, Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3>Contents of the Japanese Government's Telegram to Matsuoka</h3>
<p>Oppose the Denial of the Puppet Organization</p>
<p>Insist on Direct Sino-Japanese Negotiations</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the Japanese Cabinet held an emergency meeting and Foreign Minister Uchida was granted an audience with the Emperor, the Japanese government sent a telegram to the delegation in Geneva today. According to responsible sources, the Japanese government telegraphed its delegation, instructing them to use the final effort for mediation, but at the same time, they must insist on deleting or modifying Section 9 of the explanatory memorandum regarding the recognition of "Manchukuo," and insist that the authority of the mediation committee must be limited to following Japan's established policy regarding direct Sino-Japanese negotiations. The Japanese government also instructed its representatives that if mediation fails, they should not oppose the application of Article 15, Section 4 of the Covenant, but they must pay attention to the recommendations formulated in accordance with Section 4. It is reported that the Japanese government will first study whether the recommendations are too harsh. If they are, Japan will either withdraw from the League of Nations or imitate Germany's actions at the Disarmament Conference and withdraw its delegation from Geneva. (1st, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the Japanese Cabinet obtained the understanding of Prince Saionji and other elder statesmen regarding the government's policy towards the League of Nations, it held an emergency meeting this morning. All cabinet members attended. Foreign Minister Uchida stated that Saionji strongly supported the government's policy. The Cabinet then discussed and decided on the final instructions to be sent to the Geneva delegation. The Foreign Minister then presented the instructions to the Emperor for approval, and they were sent to the telegraph office for dispatch at 5:00 PM. When Uchida returned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he told reporters that the government had completed all the necessary procedures for issuing the final instructions. Japan's attitude has neither weakened nor strengthened. Japan will proceed with its established policy, and the policy will not change regardless of the circumstances. However, he very much hopes to continue to obtain international mediation and cooperation. (1st, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Saito Will Personally Visit Saionji</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) After Elder Statesman Saionji met with Foreign Minister Uchida yesterday, he became particularly worried about Japan's future due to the Japanese Army's insistence on acting recklessly. Today, he specially sent his personal secretary, Baron Harada, to Beijing to visit Prime Minister Saito to convey Saionji's views on foreign policy and to inquire about the government's true intentions. The Japanese government will carefully discuss Elder Statesman Saionji's opinions at the emergency cabinet meeting at noon today. After the cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Saito will personally visit Elder Statesman Saionji in Okitsu to discuss strategies for dealing with the League of Nations. (1st, China United Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>Preparing to Draft a Declaration of Opposition</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) When the League of Nations prepares a report of recommendations and submits it to the General Assembly for a vote in accordance with Article 15 of the Covenant, the foreign affairs authorities have determined the following: 1. It should be treated as merely a recommendation and not an order. If its content is difficult to accept, the plenipotentiary Matsuoka will make a declaration of opposition at the General Assembly session, and this refusal will naturally have a legal basis. 2. Submit a written statement based on the rights under Article 15, Section 5 of the report, refuting it one by one and clarifying Japan's position. Based on this policy, work has begun on drafting the declaration of opposition and the written statement. (1st, Dentsu News Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japan Continues to Send Troops</h3>
<p>Representative Yan Reports to the League of Nations</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Chinese delegation sent an important document to the League of Nations Secretariat tonight and distributed it to all parties. It is said that the Japanese 8th, 10th, and 14th Divisions have been transported by 24 trains from Busan and Seoul to the Three Eastern Provinces since January 30th, preparing to attack Rehe. (31st, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>American Advisor to the Puppet Regime Rapes Northeastern Public Opinion</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Secretariat today released a letter from Lee, the American advisor to the "Manchukuo" Foreign Ministry (editor of the Shanghai Far Eastern Times), with 586 pages of documents attached. It is said that they are all documents expressing Manchurian public opinion, including declarations, protests, and petitions, reportedly issued by various chambers of commerce and political education organizations in "Manchukuo." Lee's letter stated that when the Lytton Investigation Team was investigating in Manchuria, many people were afraid to express their true opinions because the situation was extremely dangerous. However, the new government has now consolidated its power, reduced taxes, stabilized currency prices, suppressed bandits, and relieved the people of extremely heavy burdens. Therefore, the people are now very satisfied and do not want to be governed by Zhang Xueliang again, lest they be subjected to torture for publicly expressing their political views. (1st, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Luo Delivers an Important Speech</h3>
<p>=The League of Nations Should Resolutely Declare Non-Recognition of the Puppet Organization=</p>
<p>=Believes That All Countries Will Make a Firm Statement Against Illegal Organizations=</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The work of the League of Nations Nine-Nation Committee in drafting the report has now reached the final suggestions section. However, according to reports, certain countries have expressed hesitation regarding clearly stipulating the non-recognition of the puppet Manchukuo. Regarding this matter, Foreign Minister Luo Wengan delivered the following speech today: The League of Nations has now reached a critical moment. It should, with a spirit of great fearlessness, resolutely apply the great principles contained in the resolutions of the League of Nations Administrative Council and General Assembly and represented by the League of Nations itself. The League of Nations General Assembly resolution of March 11th of last year contained a principle, namely that member states of the League of Nations should not recognize situations created or treaties or agreements concluded by methods that violate the League Covenant and the Paris Pact. The representatives of the great powers in Geneva are now hesitant to clearly declare the denial of the puppet government of Manchuria, and seem to be trying to evade the responsibilities they have already undertaken by supporting the principles of the aforementioned resolution. The fact that Manchukuo, as the Lytton Report had already recognized, exists entirely due to the presence of the Japanese army in Manchuria, then it is beyond doubt that it violates the League Covenant and the Paris Pact. For the League of Nations to declare that this puppet organization should not be recognized by countries that respect China's sovereignty is a necessary and reasonable step in applying the principle of non-recognition, and this principle of non-recognition has been declared and accepted by all countries. If any country expresses its willingness to leave room for the future illegal recognition of Manchukuo, then that country is not only seeking to undermine the effectiveness of the March 11th resolution, but also seeking to undermine the League Covenant and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which is obvious. China does not believe that this situation will actually occur and deeply believes that all the countries concerned will make a firm statement against the illegal organizations that are tools of Japanese aggression. (1st, Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3>Uchida's Speech Arouses Soviet Russia's Indignation</h3>
<p>Slightly Eased After the Two Countries Exchange Letters</p>
<p>Japanese Ambassador Ota Sends a Note to the Russian Government</p>
<p>Stating That Political and Military Authorities Have Different Views</p>
<p>(Moscow) This newspaper published today the notes exchanged between Soviet Deputy Foreign Commissar Karakhan and Japanese Ambassador Ota regarding Foreign Minister Uchida's recent speech in parliament. In the note, Ota stated to the Soviet government that Molotov's statement in his recent report to the Soviet Central Executive Committee, which claimed that Foreign Minister Uchida repeated anti-Soviet rumors from the Japanese Army Ministry's communiqué in parliament, was inconsistent with reality. Uchida's speech, in content and meaning, was completely different from the Army Ministry's communiqué. The speech advocated that Japan and the Soviet Union should find ways to maintain friendly relations while preventing "misunderstandings" from occurring. In his reply note, Karakhan stated that the Soviet government did not think it was necessary to quibble over the two views mentioned in the note. However, from Ota's note, it was recognized that the Japanese government did not want to hold the same views as the Japanese Army Ministry's communiqué. At the same time, Jia said that he would publish this exchange of notes, as Ota had expressed the hope that he would. (1st, TASS dispatch)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The tense situation between Russia and Japan caused by the declaration of Japanese Army Minister Araki on January 15th is now believed to have been greatly eased after the Soviet Deputy Foreign Commissar Karakhan and Japanese Ambassador Ota exchanged official documents today. According to reports, since Araki made the declaration, the Soviet government has felt slightly angry and restless, waiting for the Japanese government to continue its explanation. After Japanese Foreign Minister Uchida gave a speech in the House of Representatives, the Soviet Union received news that the Japanese Foreign Minister had reiterated Araki's remarks. Therefore, Molotov, Chairman of the Soviet People's Committee, gave a speech at the Central Executive Committee meeting, reporting that Uchida had reiterated Araki's remarks, and the situation between the two countries became even more tense. Until today, Ambassador Ota presented Karakhan with the original text of Foreign Minister Uchida's speech, explaining that the words regarding relations with Russia were all friendly remarks, and that the news previously received by the Soviet Union was completely false. He also said that he knew that Molotov's words were purely due to a misunderstanding and requested that they be corrected for the sake of friendship between the two countries. Therefore, Karakhan issued a brief reply, stating that the Soviet government had considered the fact that the Japanese government had no intention of confirming its Army Minister's declaration. As for what the Japanese Army Minister had said, it had been vigorously denied by the Soviet government. Ambassador Ota then requested that the official documents be published, and the Soviet Union immediately agreed to his request. It is now believed that the matter has ended due to this exchange of letters. (1st, National News Agency dispatch)</p>

<h3>Is There Really No Justice in the World?</h3>
<p>Today, the League of Nations has clearly declared its failure regarding the Sino-Japanese issue. The movement to maintain peace has also declared its failure. To whom does the responsibility for this failure belong? The League of Nations has proclaimed principles of fairness and been able to invoke its charter and conventions, yet it has failed, and peace has still been shattered. Therefore, the responsibility lies in the fact that justice cannot prevail against might, and not with the major powers presiding over the League of Nations. If the League of Nations did not proclaim principles of fairness and did not invoke its charter and conventions, yet it still failed and peace was shattered, then the responsibility for this failure would lie with the major powers presiding over the League of Nations, and not with justice. This distinction is clear to everyone. To attribute today's events to the absence of justice in the world is surely a great wrong.</p>
<p>It cannot be said that the United States has not expressed its support for justice. Countries such as Sweden, Czechoslovakia, and Belgium have also not failed to advocate for justice. However, the United States is not a member of the League of Nations. Although countries like Switzerland and Czechoslovakia are members of the League of Nations, what can they do, being small nations? Therefore, speaking from the perspective of the League of Nations itself, it has never truly employed justice to any extent. Only our China, although its national strength is weak, has a very clear understanding of justice. Today, I recognize which countries in the world can advocate for justice, which countries maintain neutrality and stand by as observers, and which countries assist the powerful and kick me when I am down. We firmly believe that if our country does not perish and still manages to be among the nations of the world, there will ultimately be a day when we meet with justice.</p>
<p>Today, it is not that there is no justice, but rather that justice is temporarily obscured by powerful forces and cannot be revealed. Therefore, on the one hand, we must fight with our blood and iron to uphold justice and struggle against the powerful. On the other hand, we recognize that any country that can advocate for justice, even if it cannot provide practical assistance, we will be grateful to and consider a true friend. We clearly understand that in this world where economic panic has reached its extreme, the people of each country are too preoccupied with self-preservation to be able to provide any assistance to us. Therefore, anyone who can maintain a neutral attitude and not favor the powerful is already appreciated by us. Let our friendly nations understand this. Our people will vow to fight to the death to strive for this justice. The League of Nations has the power to employ justice but does not use it. We must then risk our lives to seize justice from the hands of the powerful and place it in the world of light and day. Otherwise, we would rather perish with justice, rather perish with world peace.</p>

<h3>Commander Cao Yucheng of the Jilin National Salvation Army Dies a Martyr's Death</h3>

<h3>Chen Gongbo Talks About the Sulfuric Acid Plant, Which Can Be Realized Soon</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Gongbo said that China's sulfuric acid used to be supplied by foreign imports. In order to develop state-owned industry and commerce to prevent the outflow of rights and interests, the Ministry planned to fund a large-scale sulfuric acid plant. However, since the Incident in the Eastern Provinces, all industries have been exhausted, the national treasury's income has decreased sharply, and the national finances are extremely strained. If it were to be run by the government, it would be difficult. Therefore, it was presented to the Central Government for approval to be jointly run by China, Britain, and Germany. China would contribute six million yuan, and Britain and Germany would contribute five million yuan, for a total of eleven million yuan. Of China's six million yuan, three million yuan would be contributed by the business community.

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance responded to the Jiangsu Provincial Government regarding the province's land price tax, which should not exceed two percent. If there are any similar privately established illegal tax levies in the future, it is hoped that they will be strictly rejected. As for the land survey fee and road construction donation, they are temporary special donations and are not collected within the grain string, so they will not affect the 120 limit, and so on, which is even more far-fetched. These two types of land taxes should be abolished. If there are any similar illegal tax levies in the future, it is still hoped that the provincial government will strictly reject them. Please check and report back. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>German New Prime Minister's Negotiations with the Central Party Break Down</h3>
<p>Anticipation that Parliament Will Be Dissolved Within Days</p>
<p>A Nationalist Party cable from Berlin on the 1st reports that German Prime Minister Hitler's negotiations with the two Central Parties (i.e., the Catholic Center Party and the Bavarian People's Party) have broken down. It is anticipated that Parliament will definitely be dissolved within a few days. However, whether the date will be before the meeting scheduled for February 7 or after the meeting is still difficult to predict.</p>
<p>A Nationalist Party cable from Berlin on the 1st reports that the German President has signed an order to dissolve Parliament and delivered it to the Cabinet. If necessary, it can be announced at any time. Now that the Cabinet has this order, it has temporarily become a de facto dictatorship. According to afternoon news, the Cabinet will hold a meeting this afternoon to discuss the parliamentary situation, because the Cabinet does not currently have a majority of support in Parliament. However, it is believed that it will not be difficult to achieve this now that the National Socialist Party holds power. It is also reported that the Cabinet will send the order to dissolve Parliament signed by the President to Goering and instruct him to prevent Parliament from meeting, because Goering is the administrative commissioner of Prussia and has control over all Prussian police. The Cabinet's request to dissolve Parliament today was caused by the fact that the Social Democrats were about to submit a motion of no confidence as soon as Parliament opened. If Parliament is dissolved, it is expected that the general election will be scheduled for March 5, and the government can implement its policies during this period without fear of interference from others.</p>
<p>A Nationalist Party cable from Berlin on the 31st reports that after the establishment of the new German government, it has now begun to organize various urgent matters. According to the Berlin Local Instructions, the first step of the new cabinet is to mediate the differences between industry and agriculture, so that both parties can cooperate with the government. In this way, the government can engage in economic plans for prosperity, and unemployed people can be rapidly relieved. The Local Instructions was founded by the new Minister of Economic Affairs, Hugenberg, so the news carried by the newspaper can of course be regarded as the most rapid news from the cabinet. In addition, the cabinet will also discuss how to organize the short-term debts owed to various countries. As for the people, since the establishment of the new cabinet, the negotiations with the Catholic Center Party have reached what point, and whether the party is willing to cooperate with the new government. These issues are of the most interest. Today, the new Prime Minister Hitler had a long talk of more than two hours with leading figures of the Center Party, such as Cass and Frick. It is said that Cass raised many questions to Hitler and asked him to answer them one by one. Whether the Center Party can cooperate depends on the answers. Hitler will submit the discussions to the cabinet meeting tonight. According to newspapers, the government is quite willing for Parliament to agree to continue the meeting for several months, and is also quite willing for Parliament to pass a bill allowing the cabinet to have full power to deal with urgent issues. However, the passage of such a bill must be achieved with the consent of more than two-thirds of Parliament, which is difficult to achieve due to the opposition of the Social Democrats and Communists. Therefore, the new Minister of Interior, Frick, has indicated that the dissolution of Parliament in the future may still be unavoidable. He hopes that the results of the re-election will be more progressive than what it is today.</p>
<p>A Nationalist Party cable from Berlin on the 31st reports that the German capital's stock exchange has announced that the new government will adhere to the legal scope and not make any economic attempts, which has led to the financial sector's concern. Therefore, the market value of all securities has greatly improved today, with price increases ranging from two pounds to seven and a half pounds. Furthermore, the theory of a restored capitalist tendency is quite strong, which is also one of the reasons why the securities market is scrambling to buy.</p>
<h3>Jews in a Panic</h3>
<p>A Reuters cable from Berlin on the 1st reports that the Jews have been in a panic since the establishment of the Hitler government. News has come from various places today that many Jews have applied to the authorities for passports to move to foreign countries. Minister of Interior Dr. Frick told a guest today that the government does not want to take any action against these people. If these people move abroad, it will be more suitable for us. Judging from various phenomena, Hitler hopes to serve as Prime Minister for a long time, and his politics will not cause trouble, as many people expected. The new government only accounts for one-third of the National Socialist Party members, so approximately all measures will not be risky. It does not want to engage in dangerous speculation at home or abroad.</p>
<h3>Small Disturbances by Communists</h3>
<p>A Reuters cable from Berlin on the 31st reports that Berlin was quiet today except for a slight demonstration by students of the National Socialist Party. The students only lined up to the stock exchange and shouted "Down with the profiteers!" In Bavaria, many towns had street fights between the National Socialist Party and Communists, resulting in two deaths and many injuries. Students of the National Socialist Party at the University of Breslau demanded the cessation of lectures by Jewish professors and held anti-Jewish demonstrations. Today, they continued with a conflict between Communists and the police, killing one Communist and seriously injuring Xiang Ren. The Communists then harassed shops and destroyed the exhibition stands of the National Socialist Party newspapers. Although the losses were quite large, no one was injured. Prime Minister Hitler issued a declaration tonight, expressing his gratitude to the National Socialist Party men and women comrades for their sincere assistance, and thanking President Hindenburg for his generous decision to appoint him as Prime Minister. News from Amsterdam today stated that the former royal steward of Germany declared that the former emperor did not want to express any opinion on the current German government. The former emperor also denied the rumor that someone planned to leave for Doorn, pointing out that the rumor that a car had been prepared to carry him back to China was purely fabricated.</p>
<h3>US Navy Exercises Attack Tactics</h3>
<p>A Nationalist cable from Honolulu on the 31st reports that seven cruisers in today's US exercise, along with several destroyers, suddenly appeared outside Molokai Island. Although naval experts will wait until the exercise is over to judge the impact of this on the defense of Honolulu and whether Honolulu is not easily occupied by enemy fleets, it is said that these cruisers were originally scheduled to appear elsewhere, but were suddenly discovered next to Molokai Island at dawn this morning, which is a very noteworthy thing. After the cruisers were discovered, they immediately reported to Pearl Harbor, and the entire island's people stopped working and waited quietly for the start of the war in the sky. This US fleet set off from the US Pacific coast a few days ago to try to capture Honolulu in an exercise. The whereabouts of its warring fleet are still unknown. The period of this exercise is quite short, because the fleets must arrive in San Francisco before February 17 to participate in the groundbreaking ceremony for the Golden Gate Bridge.</p>
<h3>Main Conference on Disarmament</h3>
<p>Discussing the Issue of Revealing Violations of the Convention</p>
<p>A Havas cable from Geneva on the 31st reports that the Presidium of the Disarmament Conference met this morning to discuss the issue of announcing or revealing violations of the future Disarmament Convention. The Presidium still had inconsistent opinions on the issue of protecting those who announce or reveal violations. The Spanish representative, Madariaga, did not think the hesitant attitude was right. He said that the Spanish government supports providing protection to those who reveal violations. The French representative, Massigli, proposed concrete methods for the convenience of discussion, namely: 1. If a country violates the Disarmament Convention, and a private person reveals it, if that person is not an employee of the state, then no criminal responsibility shall be imposed on them. 2. If the person revealing the violation intends to slander, their punishment should also be made public. Otherwise, the international committee should send a member to participate in the debate. 3. If the person revealing the violation is a civil servant, they shall also receive the same protection, provided that they notify the relevant official in charge of the event they wish to reveal in advance. The French representative's suggestion was submitted to a special committee for review. Chairman Henderson declared that the General Committee will meet on Thursday afternoon to discuss the disarmament and security construction plan proposed by France.</p>

<h3>The Life of the Rapidly Evolving French Cabinet May Not Be Eternal</h3>
<p>Financial Difficulties Are Not Easily Overcome</p>
<p>A Nationalist Party cable from Paris on the 1st reports that the new French cabinet is now known as the Rapidly Evolving Cabinet because the average age of its members is the youngest in history. However, because Taladi is deeply loved, the new cabinet is quite popular with newspapers and the public. However, the general opinion is that its life will be as fleeting as the previous cabinet, because its nature is not much different from the Pongu Cabinet. Although Pong Lai is a financial expert, it is still questionable whether he can smoothly overcome the financial and economic difficulties.</p>
<p>A Reuters cable from Paris on the 1st reports that the new government's declaration will be submitted to Congress for a vote on Friday, and there does not seem to be any danger. The drafting of the declaration was quite hesitant, because it cannot but reveal the curtain of the government's financial plan. The new Finance Minister Pong Lai's arithmetic will definitely be different from that of the former Minister Xue Long. However, the new Finance Minister will probably raise debts to make up for the deficits, which the former Minister had tried to avoid. The stock exchange was particularly prosperous after the Social Democrats were rejected by the government yesterday.</p>
<h3>The Struggle for Supremacy in the Mediterranean France Plans to Build Fortresses</h3>
<p>A Nationalist Party cable from London on the 1st reports that the Daily Express carried shocking news today, saying that France wants to turn Corsica in the Mediterranean into a fortress, similar to Germany's hope for Goran Island before the European War. After building a solid fortress on the island, it will be able to link the fortresses of France and its allied countries, surrounding Italy and becoming the "Great Wall of the Mediterranean."</p>
<h3>Philippine Bureau of Agriculture and Commerce Plans to Promote Markets in China</h3>
<p>Taking Advantage of the Excellent Opportunity to Boycott Japanese Goods</p>
<p>A Nationalist Party cable from Manila on the 1st reports that the Philippine Bureau of Agriculture and Commerce is currently drafting a great plan to promote Philippine sugar and other products in China, so that after the US market is restricted in the future when independence is achieved, China can become a large market for Philippine goods. The Chinese Consul General in the Philippines also supports this plan, claiming that China imports a lot of foreign sugar every year, but Philippine sugar only accounts for 2%. If it can be promoted, there is no reason why Sino-Philippine trade will not increase. When Sino-Japanese relations are tense, it is an excellent opportunity for the Philippines to promote goods in China. It is reported that the Philippine Bureau of Agriculture and Commerce plans to first send a special commercial envoy to China to investigate the market situation and inquire about Chinese merchants' opinions on Philippine goods. Recently, Philippine Congressman Panggan has traveled to China and various parts of the Far East for several months. After returning to the Philippines, he also strongly urged Filipinos to seize the opportunity for China to boycott Japanese goods and develop the Philippine goods market in China.</p>

<p>A Nationalist cable from Warm Springs on the 31st reports that Sunday, February 1st, was the 51st birthday of President-elect Roosevelt. When the party leaders gathered to wish him well, Roosevelt claimed, "I view the cabinet as my own family, and its members should only be decided by me." Therefore, how the new cabinet will be composed is still something that everyone cannot guess.</p>
<h3>Russian Whaling Vessel Secretly Measures Japanese Fortress</h3>
<p>Detained for Violating the Shipping Law</p>
<p>The Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun states that the Russian whaling vessels "Apengart," "Dukurf Longd," and "Enkester" (each with 18 crew members) and the mother ship "Aliud" (with 128 crew members) recently invaded the Futami area of the Ogasawara Islands, which is not an open port, and are suspected of measuring the territorial waters of the fortress. Upon hearing the news, the Metropolitan Police Department dispatched Inspector Hiroshige of the Foreign Affairs Section, Engineer Nagano of the Ministry of Communications, Technician Miyake of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and Staff Member Shiina of the Security Bureau to conduct a thorough investigation. All the crew members were detained on the Junkei Maru, a surveillance ship of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and Captain Ivanavichi and others were sent to the Tokyo Public Prosecutor's Office, where they were considered to have secretly measured the fortress area and violated the Shipping Law.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army and Navy Conference in Hankou</h3>
<p>Plotting Disturbances to Military Operations on the Yangtze River</p>
<p>Our Authorities Striving to Maintain Calm</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since the Japanese occupation of Yu and the invasion of Rehe, the situation in North China has suddenly become serious. Unexpectedly, while the Japanese are focusing all their efforts on coveting and encroaching, they are simultaneously plotting to disrupt the Yangtze River region. A month ago, Rear Admiral Banno, Commander of the First Overseas Squadron, was ordered to be stationed in Hankou to preside over matters. He inspected the fleet from Hankou to Yichang and held a secret meeting at the Bank of Taiwan, the intentions of which are difficult to fathom. Recently, important personnel from the Japanese army and navy, such as Banno, Tajiri, Okamura, Lieutenant Commander Kushi who was newly dispatched to Hankou, and Shimizu, among others, held a Yangtze River military conference at the Marine Corps headquarters, planning all arrangements. Discussions continued for several days, with extreme secrecy. Actions observed include the installation of multiple anti-aircraft artillery emplacements in the Japanese concession, as well as a census of all resident Japanese (excluding prostitutes and children, totaling over one thousand nine hundred people), stockpiling of food, and the navy even conducted demonstrations. Soldiers from various warships drilled with cannons every morning, and armed landings were carried out in the afternoon, with some practicing bayonet charges at the lower officers' assembly hall, and others practicing aiming at the patrol station's parade ground. The situation is extremely tense. As for the defense of Wuhan, both land and water routes are under the command of Rear Admiral Wang Shouting of the naval torpedo boat squadron and Garrison Commander Ye Peng, arranged to be extremely solid. The Third Regiment of the Central Gendarmerie has already arrived in Hankou in its entirety to assist in duties. In addition to paying attention to protecting Japanese residents, they are also making every effort to prevent fires and apprehend bandits. Our authorities are also striving to maintain a calm demeanor. (January 31st)</p>

<h3>Zhang Fakui's Impressions of Traveling in Geneva</h3>
<p>=Everything at the Disarmament Conference is Controlled by Powerful Nations=</p>
<p>=At League of Nations Meetings, Military Force is Justice=</p>
<p>Former Commander of the Fourth Army, Zhang Fakui, has been abroad for a long time. When the violent Japanese bombarded Shanhaiguan, it was rumored that Zhang would return to the country to participate in the anti-Japanese effort. Recently, a letter from Zhang, dated December 19th from Paris, was received. It is recorded here to inform those who are concerned about national affairs and interested in Zhang's whereabouts. The letter roughly states: "I arrived in Suez on the morning of November 28th and traveled by car to Cairo to view the pyramids and the Sphinx, and inspected the far-right politics of the Italian Fascist Party. I arrived in Rome that day. This place was the base of Christianity and the old church two thousand years ago, from which they engaged in conquering the world. Moreover, Romans were skilled in architecture and sculpture, so the ancient relics left behind are still ubiquitous today, enough for tourists to browse. Italy completed its national unification in the late 19th century, but education was immature, industry was backward, corruption was rampant, bandits roamed the land, and beggars filled the city. It has long been despised by countries around the world. Since the Fascist Party, led by Mussolini, marched into Rome and took power, they have actively reformed politics, severely punished corruption, revitalized education, developed industry, and eliminated bandits and beggars. It has not been a full decade, and Mussolini's integrity, dedication to the country, and incorruptibility have created Italy's current position. On the evening of the third day, I went to Venice. The city has over a hundred small islands, with over a hundred waterways for boats to travel through, intricately interwoven like a net, and over three hundred bridges for people to walk on. The entire city has no vehicles. Looking from afar, the entire city seems like it is best seen at night. I arrived in Berlin on the thirteenth day. I participated in the Geneva Disarmament Conference. The result of the conference is still a set of empty words. In fact, everything is controlled by the powerful nations. Even the League of Nations is nothing more than the only mechanism for imperialists to divide spoils. Furthermore, at this League of Nations meeting, although there were representatives such as Yan, Guo, and Gu who were skilled at debate, weak countries have no diplomacy, and military force is justice. How could they possibly counter the unreasonable behavior of the Japanese representative Matsuoka? I believe that in this era of the strong preying on the weak, one should understand the lesson that military force is justice and not hope that others will uphold justice. The scenery is extremely beautiful. I originally intended to stay there for many more days, but I cannot tolerate being bullied by Japanese slaves here, nor can I watch the so-called League of Nations uphold justice. Therefore, yesterday, I accompanied Brother Yizhi on a trip to Paris, England, and southern Germany."</p>
<h3>Qing Yi's Failed Usurpation</h3>
<p>=Xi Qia and Ronghou Plotting Restoration=</p>
<p>=Japanese Side Heavily Angered, Detaining Representatives=</p>
<p>Changchun Correspondence: The Puppet Manchukuo's executive, Puyi, previously had plans to usurp the throne after the abolition of the old calendar, proclaim himself emperor, and advance to become the emperor of the Later Qing Empire. It is now heard that this matter has been discovered by the Japanese side, who ordered it to cease. The representatives of various groups who were elected to go to Changchun to urge Puyi to ascend the throne have mostly fled and dispersed, except for a small number who were arrested and imprisoned by the Japanese military police. It is said that this plot was orchestrated by the puppet Jilin Province Governor Xi Qia, the puppet Central Bank President Ronghou, and Puyi's close associates Bao Xi and Deleng'e, among others. Since Xi Qia became a traitor, he originally intended to use foreign force to succeed in restoring the Qing dynasty, planning to imitate Shi Jingtang's fatherly service to the Khitans. Therefore, when the puppet state was founded, national public opinion vehemently denounced him as a traitor, but Xi remained calm and even said to others, "Who is a traitor and who is not will be clear in the future. My aim is to support the Qing dynasty and succeed in its restoration. Moreover, I am a Manchu Qing royal, so what is wrong with a Manchu Qing royal carrying out a restoration movement? Wait until it becomes clear what kind of person I am; half a year will be enough." This was his ambition, and also the intention behind his willingness to lead wolves into the house. Unexpectedly, for a year now, Xi Qia has felt that his idealized Qing dynasty restoration movement is becoming increasingly distant from success. Even the actions of the deposed emperor and his own political power are subject to the control of others. He then believed that the unsoundness of the puppet state's system might be due to the incorrect designation. If Puyi were to be crowned emperor and obtain Japan's recognition and military assistance, he could also gain a new position internationally. At the same time, Japan's oppression and sanctions would naturally be eased, and the people of Manchuria would also be aroused by old ideas and sincerely submit to the new country. Therefore, he secretly planned everything with Ronghou, Bao Xi, and others, and enlisted several Japanese people within the Puppet Concordia Association, enticing them with high titles and great benefits, and proceeded separately. He secretly sent personnel to Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang to give instructions to various groups, ordering each group to elect two representatives to gather in Changchun for a formal petition, and then submit a memorial urging Puyi to ascend the throne. Once the order was issued, the Japanese side would be notified. At that time, even if the Japanese side were unwilling, they would have no choice. This matter progressed rapidly a month ago, and the representatives from various regions had all arrived in Changchun before January 15th, residing in major hotels. They were planning to hold a meeting at the Yuexiangchun Hotel on January 18th, but the Japanese side detected it. On the 16th, they dispatched military police to various hotels to search for and arrest the representatives who had arrived from various regions. Over ten people were immediately arrested, and the rest fled upon hearing the news. Those who were arrested confessed the truth, and the Japanese side was extremely angry. Muto Nobuyoshi summoned Xi Qia, Ronghou, and others, and scolded them severely, saying that they should not secretly carry out a restoration movement and harbor ulterior motives. He ordered them to be detained for two months. Later, after many people interceded, saying that it would be appropriate to be lenient during this League of Nations meeting, Muto finally agreed to release them. This scene of the restoration movement was thus cut short before it matured. It is heard that Puyi has recently become seriously ill due to excessive indulgence in opium and women. Zheng Xiaoxu does nothing but drink wine and write poetry every day. All political orders come from the hands of the Japanese Chief of the Puppet General Affairs Office. The heads of various puppet departments seek instructions from the Japanese before dawn and dusk. The Japanese Chief of the General Affairs Office then seeks instructions from Muto. The situation is even worse than it was a few months ago. (January 24th)</p>
<h3>Xu and He's Remnant Bandits Will Be Annihilated</h3>
<p>=Tian Songyao Goes to Sichuan to Supervise the Suppression=</p>
<p>=He Chengjun Returns from Xi'an to Hankou and Then to Jiangxi=</p>
<p>=Hunan and Hubei Armies Coordinate to Encircle and Suppress He Long's Gang=</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Xu Xiangqian and Kuang Jisun's remnant bandits fled to northern Sichuan, where they were severely suppressed by Tian Songyao, Liu Cunhou, and other Sichuan army units, suffering heavy casualties. The bandits are now surrounded on all sides, and it will not be difficult to annihilate them in one fell swoop. Initially, the bandits fled to Hanzhong, intending to invade Gansu, but due to the gathering of national troops, they were unable to succeed. They then fled into Sichuan, hoping to take advantage of the fierce fighting in Sichuan to penetrate deep into the area, recruit gang bandits, replenish their strength, and open up nests in the overlapping mountains, holding onto strategic locations. Before they fled to Tongjiang, the Sichuan war ended. Tian Songyao's Luo Naiqiong, Li Weiruo, and Liu Hanxiong units were all calmly mobilized and coordinated with Liu Cunhou's unit. At the same time, He Chengjun also ordered Hu Zongnan, Liu Maoen, and other divisions to track and suppress them from Shaanxi. The bandits repeatedly counterattacked but were all repelled. Although the bandits still number 20,000, they have only 8,000 rifles. Recently, a portion of them fled to Bazhong, further weakening their strength. Commander-in-Chief Chiang, in order to thoroughly eliminate the bandits, specially appointed Tian Songyao to concurrently serve as the Director of Bandit Suppression in the Sichuan-Shaanxi border area, responsible for clearing them out. Tian took office in Chengdu on January 28th and appointed Sun Zhen, Deputy Commander of the 29th Army, as the front-line commander. Tian and Sun are scheduled to depart for Sichuan on February 1st to supervise the suppression. In addition to the Luo, Li, and Liu units, Dong Zongxiu, Zeng Xiantong, Wang Mingzhang, Huang Zhengui, and other divisions will all be fully mobilized, leaving only one brigade to defend Chengdu. It is heard that Tian will issue orders for a general suppression on all fronts upon arriving in Sichuan. He Chengjun, having completed the arrangements, can temporarily leave Shaanxi. He originally planned to go to Nanjing from Xi'an to meet with Chiang and report on the progress, but learned that Chiang had gone to Jiangxi. He then decided to return to Hankou by plane from Xi'an on February 1st and then proceed to Jiangxi to seek instructions.</p>
<p>When Xu's bandits fled to Sichuan, He's bandits also entered Hubei from Shaanxi. They initially captured Hefeng, then hid in Laifeng, and attacked Sangzhi in western Hunan. These were all places where He's bandits had previously been based. There were not many garrison troops, so they were able to drive straight in. After Sangzhi was captured, the Hunan army made strict defenses. He's bandits once invaded Yongshun but were repelled. Now, coordination between Hunan and Hubei has been established. The Hunan army units of Chen Quzhen and Li Jue are concentrated in the Jinshi, Fengxian, Cili, Dayong, and Yongshun areas, under the command of Li Jue. The Hubei army units of Jiang Zuojun and Zhang Gang are concentrated in Yidu, under the command of Fan Xiji. The encirclement and suppression have now begun. The bandits' strength is even weaker than that of Xu and Kuang. The local people have long been ravaged and hate them to the bone. Therefore, although He's bandits have fled back to their hometown, they have no ability to rally support. The date of their destruction is not far off. The authorities believe that the western and northern parts of Hubei are critical hubs for the fleeing of various bandit gangs. In addition to ordering Xu Yuanquan's unit to be stationed in western Hubei, Xiao Zhichu's division has also been transferred to northern Hubei. Yu Zhaolong's brigade of Xiao's unit arrived in Xinye on the 31st. Wang Jinyong and Chen Yong's two brigades arrived in Zhengzhou and are heading south in batches, with one brigade designated to be stationed in Xiangyang, one in Fancheng, and one in Laohekou. The handover should be completed before February 4th. (January 31st)</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Province's Newly Designated Bandit Suppression Year</h3>
<p>Party and Government Personnel Focus on Bandit Suppression Work</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Jiangxi Province has been in a state of red terror for seven years. As of now, of the 81 counties in Jiangxi, the following are completely occupied by bandits: Zixi, Jinxi, Yongxin, Ninggang, Lianhua, Ruijin, Shicheng, Ningdu, Xingguo, Xunwu, Anyuan, Huichang, Guangchang, and Hengfeng. These counties exist in name only. The cities are barely protected, or the bandits come and go when the troops leave, causing endless disturbances. There are 42 counties, including Ji'an, Yongfeng, Ganzhou, Anfu, Guixi, Tonggu, Dexing, etc., where the situation is unsettled and bandits appear from time to time. Only about 20 counties, including Nanchang and Jiujiang, are stable and free from bandits. This time, Chairman Chiang came to Jiangxi to supervise the suppression and dispatched the 80th, 83rd, 88th, 23rd, and 87th divisions to strengthen the military force. All members of the Provincial Party Headquarters and Provincial Government held the second joint meeting yesterday. In order to demonstrate their determination to suppress bandits, they also decided that 1933 would be designated as the Bandit Suppression Year in Jiangxi. The legislation is as follows: 1. The Provincial Party Headquarters and Provincial Government will jointly issue an emergency order, instructing Party Headquarters and government agencies at all levels to concentrate manpower, resources, and time on bandit suppression work as the central task. 2. A declaration will be issued, with Committee Member Li Zhongxiang appointed to draft it. 3. A letter to the people of Jiangxi will be issued, drafted by the Provincial Government Secretariat. 4. A work program for bandit suppression will be determined, including: 1. Propaganda, 2. Comfort, 3. Transportation, 4. Disaster Relief, 5. Blocking of Bandit Areas, 6. Trade, 7. Road Repair, 8. Procurement, 9. Rescue, 10. Investigation. 5. A joint meeting of all sectors will be convened on January 28th. 6. A propaganda outline will be determined. 7. Bandit suppression propaganda will be expanded. In addition, the Post-War Committee established by the Provincial Party Headquarters and Provincial Government will also depart with the army to work at the front, handling post-war reconstruction and disaster relief in the recovered bandit areas, as well as various self-defense matters. (January 25th)</p>
<h3>Shandong People Raise Funds to Purchase Aircraft for Air Defense</h3>
<p>=The Impression of the January 28th Incident is Deepened=</p>
<p>=All Sectors Donate Funds to Resist Aggression=</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The January 28th Incident of last year inflicted a painful and deep wound on the people of the country. Time flies, and in the blink of an eye, a year has passed. All sectors of Jinan held a memorial meeting for citizen representatives on the 28th at the Provincial Party Headquarters to express mourning. Several hundred representatives from Party and government agencies and various groups attended the meeting, following the usual procedures and bowing three times to the martyrs of the January 28th Incident. Then, Chairman Zhang Zhangcun reported on the purpose of the meeting, followed by Industrial Department Director Wang Fangting, representing the Provincial Government, and Qin Qirong, a member of the Provincial Party Headquarters, discussing the necessity of solidarity and resistance to aggression, and recounting the war history of the 19th Route Army's resistance against Japan in Shanghai and the martyrdom of the car driver Hu Amao, with impassioned words and tearful voices. Finally, five proposals were passed: 1. Issue a telegram to the whole country vowing to resist violent Japan to the death and recover lost territory. 2. Send a telegram to all generals in the country urging them to unite to resist Japan's aggression. 3. Send a telegram to the League of Nations requesting a fair resolution of the Northeast Incident as soon as possible and adopting decisive and effective measures to stop violent Japan's aggression, otherwise the League of Nations should be responsible for the breakdown of peace in East Asia. 4. Send a telegram to the whole country calling on people from all regions to voluntarily donate funds to purchase aircraft and strengthen national defense, aiming to achieve the goal of having one aircraft per county. 5. Organize the Jinan People's National Salvation Fund-Raising Committee. At this point, the chairman did not report organizing the Jinan All Sectors People's National Salvation Aircraft Fund-Raising Committee. The Provincial Party Headquarters has now sent letters to the members, including Provincial Government Chairman Han Fuqu and all members, various committee members of the Provincial Party Headquarters and County Party Headquarters, Jinan Mayor Wen Chenglie, Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau Chief Wang Kairu, Banking Association President Lu Zhuan, Jinan Chamber of Commerce Xin Zhujiu and Miao Xingcun, various trade associations Zhang Guansan and Fan Chongde, and Wang Zhanyuan and Li Tianni from various sectors, among others, to hold a meeting in the coming days to elect committee members and immediately begin operations. The Shandong Provincial Aircraft Collection Committee has been established for quite some time, and has been very effective. The donations received have already reached 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Recently, Shen Honglie, Commander of the Bohai Fleet and Mayor of Qingdao, sent a telegram stating that all officers and soldiers of the navy donated 10,000 yuan, and the Qingdao Municipal Government and all its agencies also donated 10,000 yuan, which was remitted by the Bank of Communications. In addition, the Zaozhuang Zhongxing Coal Mining Company donated 20,000 yuan, the Ningyang Coal Mining Company donated 5,000 yuan, and in other areas, businessman Liu Zishan may donate 5,000 yuan, and wealthy gentleman Wang Zhanyuan may donate several thousand yuan. Many people from various agencies and sectors are rising up to respond, so it is not difficult to raise millions of yuan, which can be regarded as optimistic. (January 29th)</p>

<h3>Winter Grain Tax Extended for One Month</h3>
<p>The deadline for the winter grain tax for the 21st year is traditionally the lunar New Year's Eve. Overdue payments are subject to late payment penalties. However, due to the drop in rice prices last year, the rural economy is in a state of panic. Therefore, on New Year's Eve last year, the collection office saw a significant decline in revenue. The Finance Department has now issued a telegram allowing a one-month extension for the winter grain tax for farmers. Those who pay the winter grain tax within this period will be exempt from late payment penalties to show compassion. The county's First and Second National Tax Collection Offices have now begun collecting taxes.</p>
<h3>Finance Bureau Ordered to be Abolished</h3>
<p>The Provincial Government, due to the exhaustion of provincial funds, plans to abolish various bureaus under the county and merge them into the county government to establish departments for management in order to save expenses. This will also streamline administrative efficiency. The Finance Bureau has now informed the county magistrate that it must be closed by the end of February and will be jointly managed by the county government starting in March. There have not yet been clear orders regarding the abolition and merger of other construction and education bureaus.</p>

<h3>Construction Department Stipulates Width of Third Under-the-Slope Street</h3>
<p>The widening of the Third Under-the-Slope Street has been in dispute for several years and has not yet been implemented. Since the organization of the Widening Committee, progress has been actively pursued. It has recently been approved by the Construction Department and will continue to follow the original width classification table set in April of the 20th year, setting the total width, including sidewalks, at 8 meters. It is also permitted to temporarily not construct sidewalks and implement the 6-meter plan. After receiving the order, the Director of the Construction Bureau immediately convened a meeting of the Widening Committee to discuss engineering planning. Based on the above guidelines, an engineering design and budget estimate were drafted and submitted to the county government yesterday for forwarding to the Construction Department for review.</p>

<h3>Inviting Merchants to Operate Long-Distance Buses</h3>
<p>The Wu (Jin) Yi (Xing), Wu (Jin) Dan (Yang), and Tong (Jiang Yin) Jiang (Ning) three highways have been built, and the bridges and culverts have also been installed. However, the road surface has not yet been paved. Previously, residents of Wujin, Yu Dajun and others, submitted a request to the provincial departments to open a long-distance bus service on the Wu (Jin) to Dan (Yang) section of the Wu (Jin) Dan (Yang) Road. Now, the provincial government has decided to invite merchants to undertake the bus operation. A fund of 100,000 yuan must first be raised for road repair expenses. Those who contribute funds will receive the exclusive right to operate the buses for ten years. After the expiration of the term, they may apply for an extension. The county government received the instruction yesterday and issued the measures, ordering that merchants be invited immediately to undertake the operation in order to facilitate bus traffic.</p>

<h3>Details of the Jiangsu Guerrilla Unit's Rebellion</h3>
<p>In the spring of the 20th year, the Jiangsu Provincial Security Department recruited the sea bandits under Shen Fengshan, numbering 500 men, and organized them into the Jiangsu Provincial Maritime Security Guerrilla Brigade. Over 300 of them were stationed in Lvsi. At around 10:00 PM on the 29th of last month, due to a dispute over pay, they mutinied. Except for 27 men stationed at the City God Temple, the rest went to Lvsi Town, Qintuan, Sanjia Town, and other places to loot, firing guns to demonstrate, killing and injuring Chen Zixi and a Jiang surnamed female servant, among others. Over 500 households in the entire city of Lvsi were looted, with losses reaching over 200,000 yuan. When the mutinous soldiers retreated, they also kidnapped over ten people, taking five boats out to sea. One of the boats sailed to Kenshou, where it was intercepted by the Industrial Special Police Team stationed there. Yue Haining, the company commander of the Second Company, requested to surrender. In addition to Yue, there was also the first platoon leader, the third platoon leader, and a total of thirteen soldiers. They were all disarmed and, at 10:00 AM on the 31st, escorted to the county government for transfer to the Provincial Security Corps Headquarters in Tongcheng. After this incident occurred, the Provincial Security Corps stationed in Nantong and Haimen counties immediately dispatched troops to intercept them and telegraphed the Provincial Security Department for instructions. They were ordered to cooperate with the county magistrate to properly handle the aftermath. Zhu, the commander of the First Regiment stationed in Tongzhou, also telegraphed the county magistrates of Tonghai, Qi, and Chong on the 31st, instructing them to disarm and forward any mutinous soldiers encountered to the regimental headquarters for reporting.</p>

<h3>Land Value Tax Extended with Added Surcharge</h3>
<p>The Zhenjiang County Finance Bureau announced the collection of the second installment of the 21st year's land value tax, which is the originally assessed amount of grain, but the deadline for collection has passed. The collection has already been announced, and staff have been dispatched to urge the collection officials to obtain clearance receipts from the various villages and order the summons and recovery of various outstanding cases. Now that the two-month deadline for collection has passed, a surcharge should be added according to regulations. However, considering the continuous rain and muddy roads, which make travel between the city and the countryside inconvenient, the bureau has requested and received approval from the Finance Department to extend the deadline for one month with added surcharge. It is reported that this has been widely announced and the collection officials have been instructed to immediately go to the various villages and urge the village head and other personnel to collect the overdue taxes from door to door, and within ten days, collect all the outstanding payments for the various installments of the 21st year's land value tax, as well as the outstanding installments for the 20th year's land value tax, and submit the payments to the treasury.</p>

<p>Shaoxing</p>
<h3>Commercial Situation After the Great Clearance</h3>
<p>Among the various industries in Shaoxing, those that profited the most after the Great Clearance were soy sauce shops, due to the abundant grain harvest last year, low raw material costs, and still high selling prices. The next most profitable were cigarettes, kerosene, hardware, money shops, and foil shops. Other industries were average. Tea, silk cocoons, and silk fabrics were overstocked due to sluggish sales. Huangjiu (yellow wine) was also unable to be shipped out due to the impact of the war. The bamboo products produced in Zhoujiaqiao suffered greatly from sluggish export sales.</p>
<p>Ningbo</p>
<h3>Bandits Kidnap Villagers</h3>
<p>In Zhuangjiawan, near Huang Gu Lin, Yin County, resident Xu Songlai, who made a living selling firewood, was usually frugal and hardworking.

<p>(I) Madam Sun Yat-sen, Soong Ching-ling, advocates that the Shanghai press should lead a one-day strike by the national press to show resolve; (II) Cai Yuanpei advocates that the press should issue a declaration regarding the Liu case, requesting the government to severely punish Gu Zhutong in order to uphold the truth and handle the matter according to the law, so that those who violate the law will be severely punished; (III) Shi Liangcai stated that the press regards this matter as particularly personal, and should naturally express itself appropriately. He is willing to be responsible for submitting discussion methods to the Newspaper Association, but his statement is personal and cannot represent any organization. In addition, Lin Yutang, Zheng Zhaofen, Xie Wugang, and others advocated that the national press should unanimously criticize the case in their commentary. Shen Bao reporter Qian Hua advocated requesting party and national elders Madam Soong Ching-ling and Mr. Cai Yuanpei to make strong representations to the government.

<h3>ISSUING A DECLARATION</h3>
<p>The China League for Civil Rights issued a declaration regarding Gu Zhutong's execution of Liu Yusheng, stating that recently, Gu Zhutong, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, illegally executed Liu Yusheng, the manager of the Jiangsheng Daily in Zhenjiang, and resisted the Supervisory Yuan's investigation beforehand. This bloody case is exactly the same as the atrocities of the Northern Warlords in Beijing who executed Shao Piaoping and Lin Baishui. The people of the whole country should pay serious attention to it. The people should enjoy the absolute right to freedom of speech and publication, which is the right that citizens of modern civilized countries should enjoy. Even if Liu Yusheng had illegal acts beyond the scope of "freedom," he should be handed over to the judicial organs for trial according to the law. The administrative organs must not illegally detain him, let alone illegally execute him. However, Gu Zhutong abused his power, not only illegally detained Liu Yusheng for as long as five months, but also brazenly resisted the investigation by the Supervisory Yuan. After resisting the investigation by the Supervisory Yuan, he further illegally executed Liu Yusheng and sealed up the Jiangsheng Newspaper Office. This dark atrocity of trampling on human rights and destroying laws and disciplines has clearly proved that Gu Zhutong is essentially no different from the Northern Warlords, and is also the public enemy of our national people. In order to safeguard human rights, the people of the whole country should rise up together to make a firm resistance to Gu Zhutong's warlord atrocities. Moreover, such an extremely dark atrocity is not limited to Gu Zhutong's execution of Liu Yusheng alone in our country today. (Omission) This League is organized to safeguard civil rights and fight for civil rights. This League expresses its firm opposition to Gu Zhutong's atrocities of illegally executing Liu Yusheng. At the same time, this League believes that Gu Zhutong, as an incumbent administrative official, openly disregards the law and tramples on civil rights. If the government cannot control such atrocities, it will be a great shame to the government. This League hereby makes three demands to the government: (I) Immediately dismiss Gu Zhutong and other responsible personnel involved, and punish them according to the law; (II) Publish the articles published in the Jiangsheng Daily supplement that Gu Zhutong considers to be "propagating communism"; (III) Effectively protect civil rights so as to ensure that similar facts do not happen again in the future.</p>

<p>A special committee for the Liu case was formed to be responsible for handling the matter</p>
<h3>SHANGHAI JOURNALISTS ASSOCIATION</h3>
<p>In response to Gu Zhutong's illegal execution of Liu Yusheng, the manager and editor of the Jiangsheng Daily in Zhenjiang, an emergency joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees was specially convened at the association's location at 4:00 p.m. yesterday.

<h3>PROCEEDINGS OF THE MEETING</h3>
<p>Chairman Yan Esheng, Recorder Wu Zhongyi, (A) The suggestion proposed by members Wu Zhongyi and 12 others, "Regarding Jiangsu Provincial Government Chairman Gu Zhutong's illegal execution of Liu Yusheng, manager of the Jiangsheng Daily in Zhenjiang, to submit a request to the central government for strict handling in order to protect the rule of law," was discussed and passed.

<h3>ISSUING A DECLARATION</h3>
<p>After the adjournment of the meeting, a special committee meeting was immediately convened to draft a declaration and decided to contact the journalists associations in Peiping, Tianjin, and Beijing to proceed jointly. The original text of the declaration is as follows: The Shanghai Journalists Association believes that in the case of Gu Zhutong, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, executing Liu Yusheng, manager and editor of the Jiangsheng Daily in Zhenjiang, the articles published in the newspaper's supplement "Iron Plough" cited by him had already been investigated and clarified by Supervisory Yuan supervisors Liu Eqing and Tian Jiongjin. They were merely works depicting the state of social life in China and there was no doubt that they did not promote communism or incite class struggle. Gu Zhutong arrested Liu Yusheng and imprisoned him for five months. After being impeached by the Supervisory Yuan and ordered by the Executive Yuan to transfer him to the court for trial, he executed him. The cited laws and regulations were also inconsistent. He violated the Provisional Constitution of the Tutelage Period, despised the highest supervisory authority, trampled on human rights, and disregarded human life. Such behavior was rare even in the warlord era, and unheard of after the party rule. Gu Zhutong dared to take the risk and brazenly did so. This association, in order to respect the law and protect human rights, must rise up and make a serious protest so that those who destroy the law and disrupt discipline will be sanctioned by law. This case is not only related to the safety of the news industry and the protection of journalists, but also endangers the freedom and survival of the people of the whole country. All citizens should condemn it together. This is our declaration.</p>
<h3>ORIGINAL PROPOSAL</h3>
<p>Regarding Jiangsu Provincial Government Chairman Gu Zhutong illegally executing Liu Yusheng, manager of the Jiangsheng Daily in Zhenjiang, to submit a request to the central government for strict handling in order to uphold the rule of law. It is investigated that the Jiangsu Provincial Government executed Liu Yusheng, manager and editor of the Jiangsheng Daily in Zhenjiang, on January 21. According to the crimes reported by Gu Zhutong, chairman of the provincial government, in the provincial government's memorial week on the 23rd, the texts published in the newspaper's supplement were full of reactionary meaning and incited class struggle. The Military Commission approved the death penalty. According to the impeachment memorial of Supervisory Committee members Liu Eqing and Tian Jiongjin, the provincial government ordered the Provincial Public Security Bureau to shut down the Jiangsheng Daily and secretly summoned Liu Yusheng to the government, claiming that the newspaper violated the Publication Law and detained him for five months. Since he was not transferred to the court according to the law, he was renamed to be arbitrarily entering and exiting according to the provincial capital's martial law regulations, which obviously had other effects. As for the novels published in the supplement, they are merely works depicting the state of social life in China. What is the content and what is the accuracy of the observation? I will not discuss it for the time being. The Provisional Constitution of the Tutelage Period is to be observed by all levels of the country, and there are special articles on the protection of the people, and there are also special laws on the protection and banning of publications and speech. The responsibility of abiding by the law does not only belong to the people. What is Liu Yusheng's life and character like, and whether he has committed a crime punishable by death, are not what we want to hear. However, he was sentenced to death only because of the novels published in the newspaper's supplement, and he can be executed without trial in court. This is an unparalleled evil example in ancient and modern times, at home and abroad. Once a local official can arbitrarily make up charges and destroy the law for his own benefit, how can the people do anything? This association fights for human rights for the people of the hall and seeks protection for the news industry. It should rise up to strive for this and immediately submit a request to the central government to strictly handle the chairman Gu Zhutong's duties in order to warn others and uphold the rule of law. Please make a public decision.</p>
<h3>JIANGSU PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT'S REPLY TO THE EXECUTIVE YUAN</h3>
<p>Accuses the "Iron Plough" supplement of inciting red terror</p>
<p>Believes that treasonous propaganda is punishable by death according to law</p>
<h3>JIANGSU PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT</h3>
<p>Regarding the arrest of Liu Yusheng, the manager of the Jiangsheng Daily in Zhenjiang, the Supervisory Yuan submitted an impeachment case, and after the Executive Yuan's instruction arrived at the province, the provincial government has already enumerated the facts and legal principles in a memorial to the Executive Yuan yesterday (31st). The original text is as follows:</p>
<h3>ORIGINAL REPLY</h3>
<p>"Regarding the matter of replying to the memorial, the instruction No. 368 of the Executive Yuan states that the Supervisory Yuan's consultation No. 42 states that Gu Zhutong, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, illegally arrested and detained Liu Yusheng, manager of the Jiangsheng Daily, and the Yuan sent personnel to investigate, and again resisted, etc. A case of impeachment was filed. At that time, the Supervisory Yuan dispatched supervisors Zhou Lisheng, Gao Yihan, and Li Menggeng to review it. According to the report, it should be subject to disciplinary action and the Executive Yuan should be consulted to order the Jiangsu Provincial Government to promptly transfer Liu Yusheng to the court, etc. According to this, in addition to reporting to the National Government, the relevant documents in the original case are inspected and consulted to your Yuan for reference and handling, etc. Comply with the investigation and the Communist Party member Liu Yusheng was arrested last year. After interrogation by the Martial Law Command, it was clear that he was a Communist Party member. The seditious words in the newspaper were proved to have been written by himself. It was also clear that the criminal had joined Communist Party members in March of the sixteenth year to organize illegal trade unions and incite rickshaw pullers to strike, intending to disturb public order. The Political Department of the Second Division of the 17th Army of the National Revolutionary Army arrested and dealt with him. Although he took the opportunity to escape, his intention to plot rebellion has not stopped. As evidenced by the "Iron Plough" supplement, there are sentences such as "Our country's soldiers retreated to the left, and naturally the enemy came up to the right," "A red tide rose on the ground," and "Let the slaves fight, the era has swept up a storm, everything old will be overthrown immediately," "The era has struck a death knell, and everything old will be buried before our eyes," "Let the slaves fight," etc. His intention to incite class struggle and promote red terror is completely undisguised. After the January 28th Incident last year, Jiangsu was experiencing social and economic panic, people were uneasy, and the activities of bandits and communists were a hidden danger. There was always the risk of disturbances occurring. The government was trying to suppress the situation in order to eliminate the danger before it happened. The criminal took the opportunity to use the newspaper to incite the people, and it was obviously a deliberate act of treason. After interrogation by the Martial Law Command, the criminal was sentenced to death according to Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the Emergency Law for Punishing those who Endanger the Republic of China. The matter was presented to the Martial Law Committee for approval and execution by shooting. The execution was carried out by the Martial Law Command on January 21. The presentation was reported to your Yuan by this government in No. 17, and reported to the Military Commission in separate reports. Now, the sections forwarded by the Supervisory Yuan are hereby presented to your Yuan for reference. As for the circumstances mentioned in the attachments to the consultation from the Supervisory Yuan, the application of the Publication Law to control newspapers, the application of the Martial Law Regulations to try criminals, and the authority of the Martial Law Command to handle trials within the martial law area are all based on laws and regulations. They have not been able to appreciate the situation and blame each other with ordinary legal principles and peacetime conditions. This is inconsistent with the situation in Jiangsu Province after the January 28th Incident. As for the Supervisory Yuan's access to files, whether it can be applied to events in which the electrical affairs organ tries criminals is a major question. Because the power of the organ cannot be arbitrarily expanded by the organ itself. Moreover, the crimes of communist party members endanger the country. A slight lack of caution can cause changes. We should all have the same understanding and not be swayed by personal emotions, which would be fortunate for the future of the country. Jointly presented, respectfully presented to the Executive Yuan."</p>
<h3>DUAN QIRUI FIRMLY DENIES NEWSPAPER RUMORS</h3>
<p>Regarding the so-called "Pan-Asianism"</p>
<p>He does not know what it is at all</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaoruo and Zhang Renkui paid their respects yesterday</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, all Japanese newspapers in Shanghai carried a dispatch from the Electric Communication Agency in Tokyo the day before yesterday, stating that China, Russia, Japan, and "Manchuria" will carry out cooperation to realize "Pan-Asianism." On the Chinese side, Duan Qirui has obtained understanding. Duan Qirui has strongly advocated this theory before Chairman Chiang and Zhang Xueliang, etc. In front of this news item, a huge headline was added to sensationalize the audience. A Central News Agency reporter specially visited Duan Qirui at the World Academy yesterday to inquire about the truth of the so-called "Pan-Asianism." Duan Qirui immediately firmly denied this statement. Duan Qirui not only does not have the idea of ​​China, Russia, Japan and Manchuria" cooperating, but also does not know what the so-called "Pan-Asianism" is at all. Duan Qirui came south this time for private affairs and has no political opinions. As for Duan Qirui's views on the Sino-Japanese issue, he firmly advocates that the Japanese side must first return the Northeast to our country, and then there will be room for negotiations. Duan Qirui fundamentally denies the so-called "Manchukuo," and even more so that there is no possibility of cooperation. The so-called "Pan-Asianism" is obviously a fabricated rumor by the Japanese side to confuse the hearing of people all over the world. Duan Qirui hopes that the people of the country will recognize the cunning of the Japanese and not be deceived. Duan Qirui believes that the World Academy where he lives is a cultural institution and is inconvenient to live in for a long time, so he is looking for another house and will move within a week. Yesterday at noon, Songhu Garrison Commander Guan Ji and Staff Officer Zhang Xiang hosted a banquet for Duan at the East Asia Restaurant. Duan was too tired from socializing for days and was very tired, so he did not attend the banquet. The Anhui Association in Shanghai is scheduled to hold a joint banquet for Duan on the 4th at noon in conjunction with various Anhui industry associations in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Zhang Xiaoruo went to see Duan Zhilao and was received. He inquired about the handling of industry, education and self-government in Nantong in recent years. Zhang gave a summary report and expressed that after the weather warmed up, he would invite Zhilao to visit Tong and bring a newly compiled edition of Zhang Nantong's Complete Works, nine volumes. Zhilao and Zhang Nantong were colleagues in the first-class talent cabinet and were like-minded and had a very close relationship, so they were very concerned about various construction projects in Nantong. Zhang Renkui also went to greet him yesterday.</p>
<h3>RUSSIAN EMBASSY IN CHINA DECIDES TO TEMPORARILY ESTABLISH SHANGHAI</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai News Agency, the following news was obtained from the Soviet People's Association in Shanghai and the diplomatic circles in our country after the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The Russian Embassy decided to temporarily establish Shanghai. According to the news from the Soviet Russian Overseas Chinese Association in Shanghai, the Russian Embassy in China has now decided to temporarily establish Shanghai. After Losky arrives, because various treaties between China and Russia are urgently awaiting negotiation, in order to facilitate the negotiation, he also decided to stay in Shanghai. As for the embassy building, the association is currently looking for it. In the future, the Consulate General will be attached to the embassy to save expenses. Although the candidate for the Consul General in Shanghai has not yet been officially announced by the Soviet Russian government, according to the observations of the Soviet Russian Overseas Chinese Association and the opinions of the majority of Russian overseas Chinese, it is still hoped that Haweid, the Deputy Consul in Shanghai before the severance of diplomatic relations, can be reappointed. Therefore, the Soviet Russian Overseas Chinese Association has telegraphed the government requesting permission to appoint Haweid as Consul General in Shanghai to meet the expectations of the public.</p>
<p>Our side restores consulates in Russia. According to reliable information from the diplomatic circles in Shanghai, since our diplomatic authorities announced the resumption of diplomatic relations with Russia, they have been actively preparing to restore consulates in various parts of Russia. As of today, a total of thirteen consulates have been announced, including Moscow, Vladivostok, Luohe, Boli, Irkutsk, Tashkent, Chita, Shuangchengzi, Troba, Almaty, Anjiyan, Zaisang, Xie Mi, etc. As for the Deputy Consuls in the above-mentioned places, those who have been officially appointed by the Foreign Ministry include the Consul of the Moscow Consulate Case Qing, the Consul General of Vladivostok Xu Xiongzhang, the Deputy Consul Liu Yuying, the Consul General of Heihe Quan Shien, the Deputy Consul Huang Yuding, the Consul General of Jianli Guan Shangping, the Deputy Consul Bao Gu, the Consul of Irkutsk Zhu Beixin, the Consul General of Tashkent Mou Shan, the Deputy Consul Liu Deen, the Consul General of Chita Tan Kuang, the Consul of Shuanchengzi Zhang Rang, the Consul General of Shuangchengzi Gu Wenhua, the Deputy Consul Sun Wendou, the Consul General of Troba Gou Zengshu, the Consul General of Almaty Ba Guoxin, the Consul General of Anjiyan Yan Shuen, the Consul General of Zaisang Guanglu, the Consul General of Shuanchengzi Ma Wanlu, the Consul General of Xie Mi Xie Guosong, etc. Twenty people</p>
<p>Thirty security guards arrived in Shanghai. Since the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union, the Soviet Russian government, in order to prevent the Russian household in China from plotting sabotage, decided that before Losky, the first ambassador to China after the resumption of diplomatic relations, took office, it would first send 30 security guards to China to protect the Soviet Russian business institutions and diplomatic residences in Shanghai. This security guard team has arrived in Shanghai from Vladivostok on a Norwegian merchant ship a few days ago and is temporarily stationed there to perform its tasks. Once Losky arrives in Shanghai, it will also organize a plainclothes reconnaissance team to investigate the actions of the Russian household in every possible way to maintain the safety of the Soviet citizens in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>AFTER THE SHANGHAI COUNTY MOVES ITS SEAT OF GOVERNMENT</h3>
<p>The security of Beiqiao is extremely consolidated</p>
<p>The local area shows signs of development</p>
<p>The Shanghai County has implemented the relocation to Beiqiao Town, which has been completed. Now all the staff are engaged in internal sorting and arrangement in addition to daily official duties. Because all the items have been transported from the county office, it will take some time to arrange them properly. The county office building is more magnificent than the old office. The office of the county head's secretary is in the center of the main building. The Finance Bureau is in the east building, and the county government office is in the west building. The Construction Bureau is in the east of the lower floor, and the Education Bureau is in the west. All organs and groups are in one breath. The new money and grain counter to the east of the county office can be fully completed immediately. The area around the county office is still farmland, but it is gradually transforming into a residential area. Because there have never been any theft cases in the Beiqiao area, security has become more consolidated after the relocation. The land is located at the intersection of the Shanghai-Min and Bei-Hui motorways, between Songjiang and Shanghai. There are frequent car trips every day, and transportation is convenient. It is only half an hour's drive to Shanghai, and the cost of living is not as high as in Shanghai, which has attracted the attention of general residents. Moreover, schools have purchased school bases there one after another, and are preparing to start construction of school buildings one after another this year. In the future, when the schools move, the material needs will increase, and the number of stores and their business will inevitably increase. Among the schools that purchase land, the Law and Politics University has the widest land, about nearly one hundred acres. The second is Guanghua Experimental Middle School and Xinhua Art College, each with about 20 acres. The authorities of each school have different amounts of land. The authorities of each school intend to purchase land here. On the one hand, the land price is only one-tenth of that of the quiet areas in the center of Shanghai. On the other hand, the area is quiet, suitable for chanting, and the transportation is convenient, so there is no feeling of hardship. However, although the land price there is cheap, since the schools purchased the land, the average price per mu has doubled compared to the past.</p>
<h3>TWO INSTITUTES OF THE ACADEMIA SINICA MOVE SOUTH</h3>
<p>Books, etc. arrived in Shanghai yesterday</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Geological Institute and the Institute of Language and History of the Academia Sinica, which are located in Peiping, have been ordered by the academy to move south. All the books, archives, instruments, and antiques collected by the antique investigation team have been packed into 120 boxes and transported from Pingnan, arriving in Shanghai yesterday morning. According to Cai Yuanpei, President of the Academia Sinica, who spoke to reporters at the meeting of the Civil Rights Protection League, the books, antiques, etc. will be temporarily stored here and will be publicly exhibited on a regular basis. As for whether the two institutes will be located in Nanjing, it has not yet been decided. It must wait until the staff of the two institutes arrive in Shanghai before a decision can be made.</p>
<h3>THE SINO-BRITISH BOXER INDEMNITY FUND APPROVES THE RAILWAY MINISTRY'S PUBLIC DEBT GUARANTEE</h3>
<p>Refers to three items of income such as freight surcharges</p>
<p>Still waiting for the general meeting to be approved on the 6th of this month</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Committee held a finance committee meeting at 2 p.m. at No. 1 Bing, Jiujiang Road, to review the guarantee issue for the Railway Ministry's proposed issuance of £1.2 million in public debt for the completion of the Yuehan Railway. Attending were Chairman Rong Fu, Hua Shiye, Xi Dong Kang Deli, Finance Committee members Chen Cai, Song Ziwen, Xi Committee member Maxwell, Director General Hang Liwu, Family Adviser Ren Chuanbang, and Railway Ministry representatives Sa Fujun and Huang Zhensheng, etc. The discussion lasted for four hours and did not end until about 6 p.m. As a result, the review work of the Finance Committee has come to an end. Regarding the guarantee issue, it was approved to use the current surcharges on passenger and freight transportation on various railways under the Ministry of Railways, as well as the three items of income from the Capital Ferry and the Guangshao section of the Yuehan Railway, as guarantees for the issuance of public debt, and it was decided that the committee would prepare a report and submit it to the general meeting to be held in Shanghai on the 6th of this month for discussion and approval. In addition, the board of directors also approved the convocation of a standing committee meeting on the 4th of this month to discuss association affairs.</p>
<h3>MUNICIPAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE TELEGRAM REQUESTS NEGOTIATION ON VIETNAM'S RE-IMPOSITION OF BOOK TAXES</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education yesterday, stating, "Respectfully to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education in Nanjing, we received a letter from the Book Industry Association on the 31st of this month stating, 'It is found that book accessories are common in China and foreign countries, and elementary school textbooks in particular have many illustrations to arouse children's interest. We have never heard of them being regarded as books. However, according to the report of the Meiqun Printing Bureau in Dike, Vietnam, the books shipped from our country to Vietnam this time, including the Basic Primary School Social Studies textbooks Volumes 1 and 2, Basic Elementary School Arithmetic textbooks Volume 2, Kindergarten Readers, Kindergarten Numeracy, Basic Elementary School Art textbooks, etc., were forcibly designated as books by the customs and had to pay heavy taxes, and were also charged with tax evasion penalties and detained.' It is found that the import of books and books is tax-free, and the customs release them. This time, the French Vietnamese customs forcibly designated textbooks as books, levied heavy taxes, which is harmful to the culture of overseas Chinese in Vietnam, and is especially unfair to the Sino-French reciprocal trade agreement. In addition to presenting this to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for examination and requesting a prompt negotiation with the French ambassador, please order the government of Annam to release the detained books on the one hand and strictly verify the customs so as not to consider textbooks as books. In addition to this, we respectfully request your association to examine and grant assistance, and we are looking forward to it.' It is found that the circumstances of this case are clearly the difficulties of the Vietnamese customs officials, who deliberately changed the items when collecting taxes, which is not an increase in the tax rate. Therefore, after checking the circumstances, it is not much related to the case of reciprocal goods items not yet being signed. At this time, our country's consul in Vietnam has not been appointed, and there are no officials nearby who can handle negotiations. The only thing to do is to telegraph your ministry to forward a letter to the French ambassador, asking the Vietnamese Governor of the country to earnestly obstruct it, and still tax according to the book law, return the detained goods, and stop Zhaogongdao. We are eagerly awaiting orders, Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce".</p>
<h3>Letter from Fang Jiaobo to Fellow Villagers in Various Schools</h3>
<p>Urging Primary School Students to Donate Funds to Purchase Aircraft</p>
<p>Fang Jiaobo, Director of the Ningbo Native Place Association's First to Tenth Primary Schools, Siming Primary School, and Zhe Ning Primary School in Shanghai, sent letters to the schools yesterday, stating: "Esteemed colleagues, I recently read in the newspapers that young students Fang Xiaoruo, Chen Yingzeng, Dong Ying, and Fang Yunying sent a letter to Mayor Wu, donating four yuan to advocate for the purchase of the "Shanghai Children's Aircraft." The Mayor replied, commending them. These children, though underage, know how to love their country, which is enough to inspire the people. Our Ningbo native place schools in Shanghai have thousands of students. If each student donates one yuan, we can accumulate a significant sum to contribute to the great cause of the children's aircraft. It can also encourage primary school students to think about national disaster. I hope that after receiving this letter, the faculty of each school will promptly advise their students to enthusiastically donate. The donations should be submitted to the Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai, which will forward them to the Aviation Association for the designated purpose of purchasing the Children's Aircraft, so that children in all circles and from our native place will be inspired and see its completion as soon as possible. I eagerly look forward to it."</p>
<h3>Primary School Students' Patriotic Zeal</h3>
<p>Saving Snack Money to Help the Righteous Army</p>
<p>Zheng Xingxian (12 years old) and Zheng Fengxian (9 years old), two sisters who are female students at the private Shihua Primary School on Beikaier Road in Eastern Shanghai, heard the principal, Xu Songting, report on the situation of the Northeast War during the school's memorial week last Monday. He mentioned that barbaric and inhumane troops were constantly attacking our isolated and helpless righteous army, who were fighting in the freezing cold and starving, etc. Therefore, the two primary school students voluntarily donated 14 yuan, which they had saved from their usual snack money, and purchased donation books to solicit donations from their relatives and classmates. As of yesterday, they had raised 244 yuan. At 2 p.m. yesterday, accompanied by their parent Zheng Baolai, they went to the Northeast Righteous Army Support Association and submitted the donation to the association, requesting that it be forwarded to the Northeast Righteous Army. They took the donation book back to continue soliciting donations for the second time. The association praised the two patriotic girls and hoped that they would continue their efforts, urging students from all schools to rise up together.</p>
<h3>The Wusong Ship Disaster Relief Association Sent Representatives to Petition in Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Workers who were victims of the Wusong ship disaster, considering that the disaster had been prolonged and their livelihoods were precarious, specially dispatched representatives Tao Youxi and Gao [unclear character]liu, and others</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>four in total, to petition the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Central People's Movement Committee, and the Ministry of Communications in Beijing. The objectives of the petition are: 1. Instruct the Shanghai Municipal Government to actively mediate the situation; 2. Ensure that workers can board ships for work to maintain their livelihoods.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Government Orders the Social Affairs Bureau to Resolve the Outstanding Case of the Yong'an No. 2 Factory</h3>
<p>Party and Government Agencies Have Begun Mediation</p>
<p>But Both Sides Insist, and the Situation Deteriorates</p>
<p>All the workers of the Yong'an Textile No. 2 Factory in Wusong demanded the distribution of bonuses, and on December 20th of the year before last, a tragedy occurred. A female worker, Jiao Lianying, was strangled to death, and twelve people, including Shen Yongming, were arrested. During the trial in the court, three of the deceased died. Later, the Jiangsu High Court acquitted and released them. However, the case remained unresolved. Recently, the Municipal Government ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to find a way to resolve the outstanding case. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Municipal Government Order: The Eighth District Cotton Textile Industry Union has petitioned the Party and Government agencies, requesting them to promptly resolve the outstanding cases, including: 1. Four months' bonus for the 20th year; 2. Wage during the statutory revolutionary memorial day off for the 20th year; 3. Reinstatement of workers who were dismissed without reason and workers who were illegally dismissed by the local court prosecutor; 4. Strict order to the factory to fulfill the labor-management agreement which was violated by the employer; 5. The employer should be ordered to provide compensation to the dead and injured workers. After the Eighth District Party Headquarters submitted the request, the Municipal Government instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to investigate and respond accordingly.</p>
<p>Party and Government Mediation: Yesterday, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau sent Wang Gang, a staff member of the Third Section, and the Municipal Party Headquarters sent Lu Yinchu, a staff member of the People's Training Section, to jointly mediate. They also summoned the Yong'an No. 2 Factory of the Eighth District Cotton Textile Union for questioning. Representatives from the employer, Chen Caisheng and He Boxuan, and representatives from the labor side, Wang Yuncheng and Jin Yaowen, arrived. The labor side demanded the execution and resolution of the outstanding cases. The employer believed that there had never been a bonus in the past, that it was impossible to reinstate the dismissed workers, and that there was no precedent for wages on memorial days, making mediation impossible. Currently, the Party and Government agencies are carefully considering concrete solutions.</p>
<h3>The Post Office Modified Insurance Rates for Insured Mail to Japan and Other Places Starting Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Sugisaka Hosted a Banquet for Public Security Bureau Officials</h3>
<p>The Japanese "Shanghai Japanese Daily" reported that Major General Sugisaka, commander of the Special Landing Party, held an informal meeting on the second floor of the Yuenaojia New Hall on Zhaopu Road on the evening of the 31st. Chinese attendees included Wen Hongen, Gong [unclear character] Kui, Chen Jiwu, Liang Fuchu, Yin Tixin, Li Mu, Jin Gong, Tan Baoshou, Ju Jing, and other senior officials from the Public Security Bureau.

<h3>The Telephone Bureau Establishes a Pudong Branch</h3>
<p>Inter-Concession Telephone Service to be Signed Soon</p>
<p>Restoration of Wusong Telephone Service to Begin Soon</p>
<p>A reporter from the Huadong News Agency interviewed Mr. Yu Bingjian, Chief Engineer of the Telephone Bureau, yesterday. The various topics discussed are recorded separately below:</p>
<h3>Inter-Concession Telephone Service to be Signed</h3>
<p>The contract reform for the Inter-Concession Telephone Service has been agreed upon by the company, approved by the Public Works Department, and the French Concession authorities have no objections to this contract. Therefore, the contract can be signed soon by the Bureau, the Public Utilities Bureau, and the company. The location of the signing has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>Restoration of Wusong Telephone Service to Begin</h3>
<p>Regarding the restoration of the Wusong telephone service, the Bureau decided to restore it for the convenience of traffic in Songzhen because the Bureau repeatedly received letters from Tongji University and other organizations in Wusong requesting it. The required materials have been prepared, and workers will be dispatched tomorrow to install the equipment. Initially, 50 telephones will be installed temporarily for use by Tongji University and businesses. The service is expected to be fully operational in about a month. As for whether a fee will be charged for calls between Wusong and Shanghai after completion, the Wusong Telephone Company used to charge long-distance rates. The Bureau now intends to waive the fee according to the city telephone regulations to promote its popularity. This point has been reported to the Ministry of Communications for instructions, and it can be confirmed before the service is opened.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Pudong Branch</h3>
<p>When the Bureau built a new building in Northern Chanzu the year before last, it also built a Pudong branch in Lanni Ferry in Pudong. It has long been completed and currently stores materials and other items. Preparations are being made to establish the Pudong branch as soon as possible. In the future, telephones for users in Pudong can be directly connected through the Pudong branch. If they are calling to Puxi, the Pudong branch will connect to the Nanshi General Bureau and then connect. As for the telephone machines installed across the boundary by the existing Pudong Telephone Company, they can be resolved at the same time as the Inter-Concession Telephone Service is signed.</p>
<h3>Automatic Telephone Exchange</h3>
<p>In addition, since the city began converting to automatic exchanges, the work has been progressing rapidly. 60 machines can be replaced every day. In the Nanshi area, the replacement can be completely completed in about a week, and then the replacement of machines in the Zhabei area will continue. However, the telephone poles and wires in the Zhabei area were mostly damaged by the January 28th Incident, so the poles and wires must be reinstalled at the same time. The automatic exchange is expected to be operational by the end of the month.</p>

<h3>The Wood and Lumber Industry in the French Concession Opposes the Sanitation Tax</h3>
<p>| Industry Called a Meeting Yesterday to Oppose |</p>
<p>The wood and lumber businesses in the French Concession recently received a notice from the French police to pay a sanitation tax. They convened a meeting of the industry yesterday afternoon at 2 p.m. at the Fourth District Branch of the Citizens' Federation at No. 18 Xinle Lane, Nanyang Bridge, to oppose it. More than 20 businesses, including Tongxing, Chengda, Lixing, Maosheng, Wanfeng, and Yinji, attended. Wang Shenghang was publicly elected as chairman, and he reported that the French police recently sent police officers to notify each household to pay a classified business tax, and that there had been instances of unreasonable punishment at the Songshan Road police station.

A temporary office of the United Association of Wood and Lumber Industry in the French Concession would be established; 2. Lin Zhengtang, Huang Zhixian, Yu Xinrui, Wang Shengfang, and Xu Kaijun would be elected as representatives responsible for the negotiations; 3.

A joint letter would be sent to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association in the French Concession, the Second District Citizens' Federation, and the Shanghai Wood Industry Association to negotiate reasonably for the cancellation of the extortionate tax; 6. Representatives would be sent to petition the Chinese directors if necessary. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3>Nanyang Maru Incident: Investigation of Opium Dispute</h3>
<p>The Nisshin Kisen Co., Ltd.'s Yangtze River steamer Nanyang Maru, arriving in Shanghai from Hankou, experienced a dispute over the search for opium. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Strict Opium Inspection: When Yangtze River ships arrive in Shanghai, the Shanghai Opium Suppression Bureau often sends plainclothes inspectors on board to search for smuggled opium. All six company vessels are subject to inspection. Last month, a China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ship was set on fire and its crew assaulted during an inspection. Previously, the Nisshin Kisen Company's Yangtze River ship Xiangyang Maru was also boarded and searched, but nothing was found.</p>
<p>Searching the Nanyang: On January 30th, the Nisshin Kisen's Nanyang Maru arrived in Shanghai from Hankou and docked at the company's pier. At that time, fourteen plainclothes opium suppression inspectors arrived on board. Many of the crew members were absent. The inspectors immediately entered the cabins to conduct a search. The ship's stewards and others came forward to stop them. The inspectors identified themselves, stating that they were inspectors and wanted to search the fire room. However, the ship's stewards and others strongly refused.</p>
<p>Sounding the Alarm: The inspectors insisted on searching the engine room and fire room, but the ship's personnel still refused them entry. While they were arguing, the personnel on board accused the inspectors of being imposters and grabbed a bronze gong from the cabin, sounding it loudly to call for help. Upon hearing the gong, the inspectors left the ship and went ashore.</p>
<p>Police Capture: When the alarm was sounded in the main cabin, Japanese crew members on the bridge raised a flag. The water police immediately arrived in a small boat and boarded the Nanyang Maru. By this time, all the inspectors had left except for one who was apprehended for being slower than the others. In addition to this, an engine-related item was also inspected. The crew pointed out that the person captured was a rogue who disguised himself as an inspector. The water police have already taken the captured person to the station for questioning.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Taiwan Shipping Route to Extend to Huangyan</h3>
<p>The five vessels of the Lian'an Shipping Bureau in Shanghai, operating on the Shanghai-Taiwan route – Zhoushan, Daxing, Chuanshan, Dahua, and Taizhou – currently run from Shanghai as the starting point to Haimen, Taizhou Prefecture, Zhejiang Province, as the destination. It is now reported that the bureau, responding to the needs of the people of Huangyan and the requests of local gentry and merchants, plans to assign one of the five vessels to extend the route to Huangyan, so that passengers and cargo from Huangyan traveling to Shanghai will not have to transfer ships at Haimen.</p>
<h3>Promulgation of Registration Rules for Dock Porters Handling Passenger Luggage</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Government promulgated the "Shanghai Municipal Registration Rules for Dock Porters Handling Passenger Luggage."

(Article 3) Dock porters handling passenger luggage who have passed the review and received the approval notice must, within seven days, personally bring a registration fee of one silver dollar and a stamp fee of one dime to the Public Security Bureau to obtain a registration certificate and uniform style. (Article 4) Porters must wear their uniform and carry their registration certificate when working, so that they can be inspected by officers and police from the Public Security, Public Affairs, and Social Affairs Bureaus at any time. Before handling passenger luggage, they must first show their registration certificate to the passenger for verification. (Article 5) If a passenger does not want to hire a porter, the porter must not forcibly take the luggage or extort money. (Article 6) The price for porters handling passenger luggage is as follows, calculated in silver dollars: small items, 5 cents; medium items, 10 cents; large items, 15 cents. (Article 7) When a porter ceases to operate, they must submit their registration certificate to the Public Security Bureau for cancellation; otherwise, the guarantor will be responsible for recovering it.

Three registration principles: (1) Priority will be given to porters who are already handling luggage at the docks for initial registration. (2) The operating locations of each registered porter will be specified; those who originally operated at a certain dock must continue to operate at that dock to avoid confusion.

<h3>Municipal Health Bureau Urges Slum Dwellers to Get Vaccinated Quickly</h3>
<p>Don't Spend a Cent</p>

<p>The Municipal Health Bureau issued a notice yesterday urging slum dwellers to get vaccinated quickly, saying, "Smallpox is a contagious disease.

There are over 20,000 slum dwellings in Shanghai, housing over 150,000 people, most of whom are laborers. Because they are busy making a living, they neglect vaccination.

This is solely to prevent smallpox and protect your health. Please do not misunderstand. When the doctors come, do not be afraid. Come forward for vaccination. This Bureau has also asked the police from each district of the Public Security Bureau to provide care and inform everyone about vaccination. Please do not misunderstand the good intentions of this Bureau."</p>

<h3>Telegraph Bureau Implements City Telephone Transmission and Receipt of Telegrams Under Ministry Order</h3>
<p>｜Special Line Telephone Installation May Be Requested for Communication｜</p>
<p>Since Zhu Jia-hua took office as Minister of Communications, he has been actively and gradually seeking to improve the national telegraph business. In addition to instructing the telegraph bureau to use telephone numbers as the address of the recipient and already implementing this yesterday, he yesterday ordered the bureau to implement two methods: using telephones to transmit telegrams and studying the national pronunciation telegraph code, and limited the implementation to starting today. The details of the methods are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Implementing Three Methods: According to Hua Jinghan, Section Chief of the Business Section of the Telegraph Bureau, in order to facilitate telegrams, the Ministry of Communications specially ordered this Bureau to implement three methods of improvement: (1) Using telephone numbers as the address of the recipient. This measure was implemented today (i.e., yesterday), and senders have already come to send telegrams. (2) Using telephones to transmit telegrams. This Bureau only received the order yesterday and is also scheduled to implement it starting today (methods recorded later). (3) Studying the national pronunciation telegraph code. This method uses one, two, or three words of the national pronunciation to replace the original numerical code for each character. This Bureau is currently studying it, but due to various reasons, it is difficult to implement it immediately. As for the implementation period, it will be no earlier than mid-April or May of this year.</p>
<p>Ministry of Communications Instructions: The Bureau received instructions from the Ministry of Communications yesterday, stating, "In order to comply with the matter, the Ministry has formulated a method for sending and receiving telegrams by city telephone in order to facilitate public communication and increase the speed of telegrams. Now, 100 copies of the method, along with blank application forms and registration books, are sent to the bureau for compliance. This order."</p>
<p>Abstract of the Method: The method for sending and receiving telegrams by city telephone has a total of fourteen articles. The key points are recorded below: (1) Telephone users who wish to have telegrams sent from other places transmitted by telephone from the local telegraph bureau or radio station (hereinafter referred to as "Bureau") or who wish to have telegrams sent to other places transmitted to the Bureau by telephone must obtain an application form from the Bureau, fill in the following items, and submit it with a registration fee of one silver dollar for registration with the Bureau: (A) Name and detailed address of the applicant; (B) Telephone number installed; (C) Receiving or sending telegrams, or both; (D) Daily time for receiving or sending telegrams; (E) Code word; (2) After receiving the application form and registration fee, the Bureau should immediately issue a receipt, register the items opened in the application form in the registration book, verify the start date, and reply to the applicant for verification; (3)(4) omitted; (5) No additional handling fee will be charged for telegrams sent and received by telephone; (6) Those who wish to send telegrams by telephone must prepay a deposit sufficient for half a month's telegram fees, which will be determined by the Bureau.

If the deposit has been used up and not continued, the Bureau may stop receiving telegrams; (7) Before receiving or sending telegrams by telephone, the recipient or sender (hereinafter referred to as "recipient and sender") must report their name or business name and inform the Bureau of the agreed code word for verification. The code word should be kept strictly confidential by both the recipient and sender and the Bureau, and may be replaced by the recipient and sender by notifying the Bureau in writing when necessary to prevent impersonation; (8) When transmitting telegrams on the telephone, Chinese telegrams should read out the telegraph code one by one, and foreign telegrams should read out the letters one by one. However, for the convenience of the other party in identifying, the telegraph code and letters may be transmitted according to the following reading method when necessary (reading method omitted); (9)(10) omitted; (11) When the Bureau cannot transmit telegrams quickly by telephone for any reason, it should immediately seal the telegram, note the reason, and deliver it by messenger; (12) Recipients and senders may contact the Bureau to install a dedicated telephone line for sending and receiving telegrams, and the cost will be borne by the recipient and sender; (13) Those who agree with the Bureau to send</p>
<h3>Record of the Annual Meeting of the Chinese Leprosy Relief Association</h3>
<p>=Speech by Director of Health Bureau Li Ting'an=</p>
<p>=Election of Yan Fuqing and Others as Directors=</p>
<p>The Chinese Leprosy Relief Association has been established for seven years and has been very active in leprosy relief work. The association held its seventh annual meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:30 in the Zhongshan Hall on the fifth floor of the YMCA on Bowuyuan Road. The details of the meeting are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Attendees</h3>
<p>The attendees included Kuang Fu-zhao, Chen Yongfan, Cheng Lian, Wu Liande, Diao Xinde, Wu Weide, Ou Weiguo, Mrs. Cai Bingjiu, Wang Zhiren, Chen Wenying, Liu Liqian, Yan Fuqing, and representatives from the Social Affairs Bureau Chen Lengseng, representatives from the City Party Department He Yuanming, and over thirty other people.</p>
<h3>Work Report</h3>
<p>After the meeting was announced, the chairman of the association, Li Yuanxin, delivered a welcome speech. Next, the general secretary of the association, Wu Zhijian, reported on the progress of the work in the past year, saying that in recent years, the Yangtze River flood and the two major incidents of September 18th and January 28th were unprecedented events in history and had a great impact on the work of the association. The leprosy relief work from July 20th to December 21st is briefly reported below: (1) The Hongkou Skin Hospital, sponsored by the association, treats leprosy patients two days a week, with 135 leprosy patients. The director is Dr. Chen Hongkang, and the annual expenditure is 4,000 yuan. When the January 28th Incident occurred, the hospital was located in the war zone, and doctors and nurses were sent to join the temporary Red Cross to rescue the wounded soldiers. (2) A new hospital will be opened on Qiongnan Island, Guangdong, in cooperation with the local Chamber of Commerce, and houses are currently being built, which will be completed soon. (3) Luoding County, Guangdong, is the hometown of Cai Tingkai, the commander-in-chief of the 19th Route Army. Dr. Dick founded a hospital there seven or eight years ago, but it was small in scale. The association now bears half of the funding each year. (4) In Qingyuan County, Guangdong, the customs are very strange. Anyone with leprosy must be driven onto a boat and cannot go ashore for life. The church pastor Wu Yinte has operated a relief boat, but the equipment is not complete. After I went to inspect it, a base has been purchased and a hospital will be built soon to accommodate leprosy patients. (5) The address of the Xiamen branch has been allocated over 100 mu of land by the Siming County Construction Bureau and will be built soon. The president of the association, Dr. Lin Wenqing, the president of Xiamen University, is making great efforts to raise funds. (6) The Nanchang branch is the first branch established by the association, with a history of over two years of operating a hospital. A new auditorium and workshop have been built for leprosy patients to gather for work and it is planned to purchase land to add wards to accommodate 60 people. (7) Last Christmas, the association donated a total of 7,839 yuan to widely provide relief to leprosy patients in various provinces. (8) From October 5th to 6th, the association convened a national leprosy conference at the Lister Institute, and representatives from the United Kingdom and the United States were sent to attend the conference. The results of the conference included three items: (A) A request was submitted to the Ministry of Health to formulate national leprosy regulations, which the Ministry has now begun to draft, and the association's written opinions have been prepared and submitted; (B) A request was submitted to the Ministry of Education to include leprosy teaching materials in textbooks at all levels, and the Ministry has notified the National Education Office to order various bookstores to compile them; (C) Drugs for leprosy relief in the Philippine Islands are very effective, and the conference decided to adopt them. The Governor of the Philippines has promised to supply them as much as possible, and they will be transported to Shanghai soon and distributed throughout the country to provide relief to leprosy compatriots. As for future plans, special attention will be paid to the number of items in the five-year plan for leprosy relief and actively carried out. I will go to inspect Jiangbei and other places in Hunan within the month and build hospitals again.</p>
<h3>Li's Speech</h3>
<p>Next, Dr. Li Ting'an, Director of the Municipal Health Bureau, gave a speech, saying, "Today is the seventh annual meeting of the Chinese Leprosy Relief Association, and I am very honored to attend. The association has the research of experts from all over the world on leprosy relief, so I don't need to say more. In my opinion, leprosy is the most terrible disease, and it often does not forgive patients, driving them out to drift and make a living, which is very pitiful. According to the survey and statistics of the national expert Mr. Wu Liande, there are more than one million leprosy patients in our country, and the relief problem is very serious. I often read your association's monthly magazine as a reference, including the five-year plan for leprosy relief, such as (1) making a detailed leprosy survey, (2) compiling the facts of leprosy into teaching materials for schools, (3) participating in urban sanitation campaigns in various places, (4) organizing the Central Leprosy Association, (5) convening national leprosy conferences, (6) urging the government to promulgate leprosy laws, (7) building at least one leprosy hospital in each province with leprosy, (8) having at least one leprosy treatment center in major cities, (9) holding a national student elimination of leprosy speech contest every year, (10) finding ways to protect and cultivate leprosy children (11) arranging for the resettlement of cured leprosy patients, etc. I am very admired. Hearing the report of Mr. Wu Zhijian, General Secretary of the association, and the results of the efforts to promote it, I have to express some feelings. Everyone thinks that the government does not cooperate with leprosy relief and expresses dissatisfaction. After investigating, there are many diseases in our country, chronic diseases such as tuberculosis, lung disease, trachoma, venereal disease, leprosy, and acute diseases such as cholera, scarlet fever, diphtheria, etc., and the scope is very large. The Health Bureau focuses on public health and cannot specialize in a certain disease. Also, because the finances are very tight, it cannot subsidize the progress. I believe that in the future, when the health cause is developed, the government and the leprosy problem will be able to cooperate and pay attention to relief work. I also express my sympathy for your association and wish your association to continue its efforts, and hope that citizens, medical circles, and health circles will cooperate and carry out the work together. I am very fortunate."</p>

<p>Gamblers of all nationalities involved</p>
<p>The French Concession authorities have long strictly prohibited gambling within the concession, but recently a Frenchman named Hairbo (transliteration) initiated the establishment of a roulette gambling den in a large house at No. 803 Foch Road in the French Concession, gathering crowds to gamble.

The foreign nationals were handed over to their respective consulates for further investigation, while the Chinese were temporarily detained. Yesterday afternoon at 12:00 PM, Lin and the other eleven Chinese were sent to the Second Special District Court, where Judge Zhang Chaozuo presided over the second criminal court for the trial. The police lawyer, Gu Shouxi, presented the case, stating that the police needed to conduct further investigation, and requesting the court to postpone the hearing to a later date. When questioned, Lin Fengzhang confessed to being a dealer at the den after being introduced by a certain Westerner and stated that he had only been working there for five or six days. Shen Changsheng and Zhou Heshun similarly confessed that they had been invited to gamble the previous evening by a Westerner they knew, lost several tens of dollars, and were then arrested. They denied helping with the gambling and begged for leniency. Wang Liansheng and the other nine people all claimed to be coolies and servants.

<p>Reader Consultation</p>
<h3>What is China's problem?</h3>
<p>| Mr. Shen Zuguang's letter seen in yesterday's column |</p>
<p>Reply: I have read your letter several times, and it is quite difficult to answer because what you are saying and what we are thinking about every day are at least two centuries apart, or like being in the tropics and exchanging pleasantries with a person from the North Pole. I simply don't know where to start. This is the first reason. You lack horizontal knowledge of modern political theory and its history. If I were to answer, I would have to start from the beginning. This is the second reason. Even if I analyze your original text, its main points are mostly vague and lack definite concepts, making it difficult to understand. As the ancients said, "If my own status is not clear, how can I worship my mother-in-law?" If I really answer, it would be like a donkey's lips not matching a horse's mouth, and the answer would not address the question. This is the third reason. Now, I will first discuss the points you raised in your original letter. After I receive your definite and further reply, I will conduct a detailed discussion. (1) Your letter says: "Everything succeeds with preparation, and fails without it." China's reforms in the past twenty-two years have always gone wrong because they have fallen into the trap of "just doing things first and then seeing what happens." The overthrow of the Qing Dynasty and the establishment of the Republic of China, while formally beginning in 1911, actually had its roots in the anti-Qing movements and theories of the Ming Dynasty loyalists after the Qing Dynasty entered the customs. After the Opium War, there was the Taiping Rebellion. In this revolutionary struggle, the most important democratic tasks were put on the agenda. During the Boxer Rebellion, the Boxers rose up to resist imperialism. Although they advocated "Support the Qing, destroy the foreigners," their violent resistance not only dealt a heavy blow to the imperialists but also posed a great threat to the Qing government. Although both of these revolutions failed, the Qing court had no choice but to open schools, abolish the imperial examination system, promote industry, and train new armies. As revolutionary movements brewed for a long time in various places, the struggle between anti-Manchu thought and monarchism became very intense. The people of the country, seeing the Qing court's incompetence, turned to yearn for revolution. By the time of the 1911 Revolution, all provinces followed suit. This kind of mutual influence and continuous growth has been going on for almost three hundred years. Can it still be considered "without preparation"? In your opinion, what kind of "preparation" is needed? What are you "preparing" for? Is it truly like the Qing court's so-called "preparation for constitutionalism"? Moreover, we know that the plans for improving or changing the lives of an individual, a family, a locality, or a country are never conceived by some great men or celebrities who close their doors and fantasize. Instead, they are formed in actual struggles, experiencing the current needs, and thus taking shape. The problem with the Chinese people now is not the lack of planning or "preparation," but the fundamental lack of "doing." Take the War of Resistance against Japan, for example. We hear every day that we have the determination to resist Japan, but in fact, there is no determination at all. We hear every day that we have made sufficient preparations, but in fact, there are no preparations at all. We hear every day about long-term resistance, but where is the reality? Your so-called "just doing things first and then seeing what happens" is actually the opposite of the truth! No matter what the matter is, planning only comes after doing. Planning and preparation are part of the process of doing. Without doing, planning and preparation become empty talk to deceive people. On this point, you have already made the mistake of reversing cause and effect. (2) Your letter raises a question: "What is a good country? What is a good government?" This is indeed a very important question. Your answer is "Everyone in the country lives in peace and prosperity." This is wrong. Throughout the world, past and present, it is impossible to find a good country and a good government where "everyone lives in peace and prosperity." You can only give this kind of irrelevant answer to this question because you don't first explain what a country is and how to explain its goodness or badness. You don't first explain what a government is and how to explain its goodness or badness. Let me be blunt: it's not that you haven't explained what a country or government is, but that you haven't fundamentally understood what a country is and what a government is. That's why you say things like "The reason for the establishment of a country..." Once you go wrong on this path, you will always be wrong. (3) Your letter also says, "In the past twenty-two years, China has tried all kinds of political systems, but none of them have been successful." This is even more wrong! What exactly are the so-called "various systems"? Where exactly have they been "tried"? To be honest, we have all been through the tides of the 1898 Reforms, the Eight-Nation Alliance, the 1911 Revolution, and Hong Xian's imperial dream. Tell me, what exactly are these "various systems"? (4) Your letter says, "Every country has its own history, human nature, customs, and habits." This is another "Four Harmony Soup" statement. What is called "Four Harmony Soup"? Some incompetent doctors, when diagnosing a patient, cannot determine the true source of the patient's illness and dare not prescribe real medicine. Therefore, they always prescribe "licorice, ledebouriella, schizonepeta, and dwarf lilyturf root" for people to eat, which is called Four Harmony Soup. Although the patient cannot be cured by eating it, it will not make the illness worse (in fact, it is an incompetent doctor killing people), just to perfunctorily deceive money. A group of dull-minded people always talk about "history, human nature, customs, and habits." But I want to ask: What is history? What is human nature? What are customs and habits? How are they produced? If you cannot explain their origins, then you should keep your mouth shut and study them first. (5) Your letter says, "China should have a constitutional monarchy, and the warlord conflicts in the past and present might be less common." You are advocating for a constitutional monarchy. However, you also say, "I think any organization with power, whether large or small, is better off with a dictatorship. Although America is a republic, its president is a dictator, and the Secretary of State is nothing more than his staff. Mussolini in Italy and Stalin in Russia are both dictators." You are also advocating for "personal dictatorship." What exactly is "dictatorship"? The British constitutional monarchy is certainly not a personal dictatorship, but it is not suspended in the air. It has its own social foundation, that is, a class or a group. As for Stalin in Russia and Mussolini in Italy, although they are said to be personal dictatorships, their dictatorships are vastly different. They each have their own class background. The Russian political system is a proletarian dictatorship, that is, a proletarian dictatorship. The so-called "Stalin" dictatorship is just a short-term historical process in the initial stage of the proletarian dictatorship. Mussolini's dictatorship is nothing more than a representative of fascism, that is, a very right-wing, extremely reactionary bourgeois dictatorship. There is no such thing as a purely personal dictatorship without a mass base. The difference between Stalin and Mussolini is like the difference between heaven and earth. You are putting them all together and smelting them in the same furnace, which shows that you seem to lack analytical skills. (To be continued tomorrow)</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Education Department Bans Illegal Organizations</h3>
<p>Jiangsu Agricultural Society and others unregistered</p>
<p>Circular issued to all counties to investigate and ban them</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Education Department issued a directive to all county magistrates regarding the ban on the unregistered Jiangsu Agricultural Society and other organizations, as ordered. The directive stated: "We have received Directive No. 521 from the Jiangsu Provincial Government, ordering compliance. It is ordered that the establishment of academic organizations must be approved by the provincial educational administrative authority to be legal. Now, there are so-called Jiangsu Agricultural Society, Chicken Farming Society, Bee Farming Society, Animal Husbandry Society, Jiangbei Salt Reclamation Promotion Association, Cultivation and Research Society, Jiangsu Rural Improvement Society, and other organizations. It should be investigated whether they have been approved and registered, in order to uphold the law. It is hereby ordered that the Department handle the matter and report back." After investigation, it was found that the Jiangsu Agricultural Society, Chicken Farming Society, Bee Farming Society, Animal Husbandry Society, Jiangbei Salt Reclamation Promotion Association, Cultivation and Research Society, Jiangsu Rural Improvement Society, etc., have not directly applied to this Department for approval and registration, nor have the relevant Education Bureaus forwarded applications for filing. The establishment of various cultural organizations is originally intended to promote academics and benefit the people, and this Department encourages it. However, those who establish such organizations must act in accordance with the law, and no procedures should be neglected. If, as mentioned above, the so-called Jiangsu Agricultural Society, etc., have not applied to the county for approval and registration, and have not been forwarded by the Education Bureau for filing with this Department, it is not in accordance with the law and should be immediately investigated and banned. In addition to reporting back to the Provincial Government, this order is hereby issued to the county governments to immediately investigate and ban the above-mentioned unregistered Jiangsu Agricultural Society and other illegal organizations and report back separately. This matter concerns the execution of an order to investigate and handle the matter, which must be handled properly and without delay or negligence. This order is issued."</p>

<p>=Hundreds of Men and Women Participate in Track and Field and Ball Games=</p>
<p>|Lu Guofan and Ding Baochen Commended for Their Promotion|</p>
<p>Simao is located in remote southern Yunnan. Although it is the capital of the Sipu region, it is a remote and desolate area plagued by miasma. The population is sparse, and the market is bleak. It has long been unnoticed by the world. This year, Simao suddenly held a grand sports meet. The meeting was held for a total of four days, from January 1st to 4th of this year. There were field events, track events, and various ball games, such as basketball, football, team ball, and tennis. It is particularly commendable that women actually participated in basketball and tennis competitions. In addition to sports, there were also various dances, games, and national martial arts. Simao is a small town, and the people all live by farming. In recent years, due to the ravages of epidemics, the population has been decreasing. There are famines everywhere, and the city is desolate. During the few days of the meeting, tens of thousands of people were in the streets, gathering in the sports field to watch. There were also hundreds of athletes. The layout of the venue was also quite impressive. It is heard that this meeting was due to the promotion of Lu Guofan, the Director of Colonial Affairs of Sipu.

Ding Baochen, the magistrate of Simao County, also made many plans and raised huge amounts of money, and the meeting was able to be held without any difficulties.</p>

Zhou Baigui scored again, making the score twenty-six to twenty-four, a difference of one goal. Qingguang ultimately failed to break through the blockade and lost to Nanxing with a score of thirty to twenty-five.

<h3>Hong Kong Tennis World Circumstances Xu Huipei Has Hope of Winning Championship</h3>
<p>Nineteen-Year-Old Youth Group is the Future Champion</p>
<p>A Dark Horse, Lun Qiang's Only Rival</p>
<p>Lun Qiang Brothers Fear Few Rivals for the Doubles Championship</p>
<p>(Hong Kong Correspondence) The Hong Kong Lawn Tennis Championships are about to begin. Famous players from Hong Kong will participate to win the championship, such as the younger Lun Qiang, the older Lun Qiang, and Fen Qiao. However, the most eye-catching player, considered to be Hong Kong's future champion, is the nineteen-year-old Chinese youth Xu Huipei. The unanimous praise and similar observations from various parties are also a great hope for the future of Chinese tennis.</p>
<p>The Championship is About to Change Hands</p>
<p>In this tournament, the championship is likely to change hands, producing a new champion and a new leader, giving Hong Kong's tennis world a new look. The younger Lun Qiang SirdarRumjahn is the holder of the championship, but Xu Huipei, who was defeated by Shanghai veteran White in the previous inter-port competition, is seen as the younger Lun Qiang's strong rival. The singles are like this, and there are few who can compete with the Lun Qiang brothers in doubles.</p>
<p>Xu Huipei's Achievements</p>
<p>Xu Huipei was a dark horse in the inter-port competition, defeating Shanghai veteran White. His speed of shooting is unmatched in Hong Kong. The backhand is his masterpiece. In the recent past, he has never suffered any setbacks. Because of his easy success, there are many who worry about him, thinking that winning is easy and losing is easy. To be fair, if Xu is in the best situation, he can dare to say that there is no one in Hong Kong who can compete with him. If Xu wins the Hong Kong championship, his performance will be similar to his performance against White.</p>
<p>Fen Qiao and the Older Lun Qiang</p>
<p>Fen Qiao has won the championship for the past three years, but has always fallen short. This year, with Xu Huipei and the younger Lun Qiang ahead, there is probably no hope. As for the older Lun Qiang H.D.Rumjahn, he has been working hard for many years, but is still regarded as a non-tactical player. The results of his efforts still cannot change the outside world's observations. The older Lun Qiang is ranked third in Hong Kong, and his ball skills have indeed improved a lot. If he is lucky in the draw, he may be able to reach the final.</p>
<p>British Naval Commander Peck</p>
<p>Among the group of famous players, there is one more person who is noteworthy, the British Navy Commander Peck of the British warship Kent. Peck performed exceptionally well in a recent game against Fen Qiao, and also won against the younger Lun Qiang in a practice match with a score of two to one. His backhand is as good as Xu Huipei's. Peck must be one of the final eight.</p>
<p>Seven Pairings in Doubles</p>
<p>In doubles, the Lun Qiang brothers are naturally the strongest pair with the highest hopes. However, there are endless changes, and it is difficult to say for sure with so many strong rivals. The doubles pairings are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Lun Qiang Brothers (2) Fen Qiao and Gorman (3) He Jialiu and Yu Wenjie (4) Xu Huipei and Wu Shiguang (5) Harry William (6) Peck and Shaw (7) Luo Wenhui and Kun Cu.</p>

<h3>The Housewife's Responsibility</h3>
<p>— Pan Yang</p>
<p>Housewives bear significant responsibilities within the family. All matters, big and small, converge upon them. They wield the power of choice over all daily necessities. Excluding abnormal families where authority is usurped, Chinese housewives are truly the commanders of the household. In large families, although wives can often discuss matters, most hold the view that it's not their place. Therefore, whoever assumes this important task is solely responsible for the seven daily essentials. As for small families, how can the heads of the household, exhausted from their occupations, possibly consult on every detail? Thus, housewives must shoulder the burden. The above describes the reality. As to whether women should leave the home and enter society, that remains a theoretical debate and is beyond the scope of this article, so it need not be discussed.</p>
<p>Currently, facts demonstrate that housewives, as masters of household life, occupy an important position as consumers. Therefore, in this national goods movement, housewives bear significant responsibility and mission. The severity of the national crisis and the huge trade deficit should serve as a warning to awaken us from our delusions. From the perspective of household economics, we should certainly not use expensive imported goods. Moreover, many emerging domestic products are much better than foreign goods, and some can replace them. Because we are Chinese, we should resolve to use domestic goods. From now on, do not patronize stores that promote imported goods; instead, frequent Chinese national goods companies.</p>
<p>In the past, people were dominated by the idea of worshipping foreign goods. Housewives – especially modern women – considered using foreign goods fashionable and beautiful. In reality, every country in the world regards using domestic goods as a virtue. Visiting Chinese national goods companies is glorious, spirited, and resolute. Once we understand this, housewives bearing significant responsibility should immediately strive to realize it without shirking their duty. Based on correct ideas, we should vigorously refute erroneous thinking. I love national goods, I use national goods, I buy national goods, and my conscience gains immense comfort. Who dares to say this is not beautiful, because it is a virtue!</p>
<p>Reversing the annual trade deficit of 500 million taels of silver is precisely the responsibility of us housewives. We should shoulder this significant responsibility without hesitation.</p>
<h3>Four Major Tasks for the National Goods Year</h3>
<p>— Ai Wu</p>
<p>1.  Raise the Level of Consumption: Promoting national goods truly requires promoting manufacturing and increasing production. More importantly, it requires raising the level of consumption of national goods among our people. Once the level of consumption rises, national goods will sell well. Seeing the potential for profit, everyone will be willing to manufacture national goods. If the level of consumption does not rise, merely promoting manufacturing will result in stockpiled goods, financial stagnation, factory bankruptcies, worker unemployment, and overproduction, which is very dangerous. There are many ways to raise the level of consumption, including promotion, publicity, and rewards. I believe the most effective method is for all public and private organizations nationwide to unite and require all employees, large and small, to wear and use national goods. Within a year, this will surely shift the atmosphere. As the ancients said, "The virtue of a ruler is like the wind; the virtue of the people is like grass. When the wind blows upon the grass, it must bend." There are many such examples throughout history that are readily available.</p>
<p>2.  Pay Attention to the Price of Goods: Affordable and high-quality products are the key to promoting national goods. If the price is low but the quality is not good, only a small number of people in the lower middle class will buy them. If the quality is good but the price is not affordable, only a small number of people in the upper class will buy them. If the quality is not good and the price is not affordable, then no one will ask about them, which is only logical. A common problem among Chinese people is that once a product sells well, they either cut corners on materials or raise the price, which is equivalent to suicide. This is something everyone should pay serious attention to in the future.</p>
<p>3.  Protect Invention Rights: Inventing something takes a lot of effort. When others see that it is profitable, they all start to imitate it, leading to oversupply and forcing prices down to sell off inventory. You lower the price, and I lower the price. The price keeps dropping until it becomes unprofitable. The result is a lose-lose situation, creating opportunities for foreign goods to invade. Therefore, in the future, anyone who makes an invention should register it with the legal authorities. Once registered, their invention rights should be effectively protected. With this approach, everyone will naturally put in hard work and not dare to take shortcuts.</p>
<p>4.  Train National Goods Personnel: It is certainly necessary to train manufacturing personnel, but it is also necessary to train sales personnel. To ensure that the training is effective, experts should be hired to handle it. This is fundamental to promoting national goods, and petty expenses should not be spared. Just taking the training of sales personnel as an example, how to train their skills? How to supplement their knowledge? How to cultivate their morals? These are all very complex issues.</p>
<p>The national goods industry in the National Goods Year should earnestly carry out these four tasks. Without uttering empty slogans, without being greedy for more than one can handle, and without working sporadically, I can confidently say that the future of national goods will definitely be bright.</p>

<h3>Minutes of the Founding Meeting of China National Goods Co., Ltd.</h3>
<p>Time: 3:00 PM, January 20, 1933</p>
<p>Location: Shanghai Bankers Association, No. 4 Hong Kong Road, Shanghai. Section Chief Wu Huanru, representative of the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau, attended to provide guidance. (1) 225 shareholders and representatives attended, holding a total of 3,956 shares, all exceeding the legal quorum. The meeting was declared open. (2) Mr. Pan Yangyao was publicly elected as chairman. (3) The chairman led the attendees in customary rituals. (4) The chairman reported on the purpose of the meeting, stating that after several months of preparation, the company had now fully collected its share capital and the number of attendees and shares met the legal requirements. Therefore, the founding meeting was naturally established. (5) Section Chief Wu Huanru, representative of the Social Bureau, delivered a speech, expressing his great pleasure in participating in the founding meeting of China National Goods Co., Ltd., as national goods companies were still a pioneering endeavor in China. In recent years, while serving in the Social Bureau, supervising agriculture, industry, and commerce, he had deeply felt the importance of promoting national goods and had several times considered using temple properties and public land to build a large-scale national goods market, but all efforts had been unsuccessful due to various difficulties. This shows that although the government has great determination to promote national goods, it still requires the efforts of the business community to have an effect. This company is organized by a union of major national goods factories, and the managers of each factory are successful entrepreneurs. Now, the minds, talents, and experiences of so many successful people are combined to run a large-scale national goods company, and its future is bright, which can be confidently asserted. (6) Chief Preparer Mr. Fang Yexian reported on the preparatory process, stating that the company was initiated around September of last year. At that time, the Nine Factories National Goods Temporary Market, formed by nine factories including China Chemical Industrial Society and China Enamel Factory, had achieved satisfactory results, so there was a motion to organize a permanent national goods market. However, most national goods markets in Shanghai were disorganized and unsystematic, making management extremely difficult. Therefore, it was decided to adopt a company structure. A preparatory office was established on November 1st of last year to begin preparations. A business location was rented at the Mainland Market, and equipment was prepared and the building was decorated, all of which has now been completed. The share capital of 100,000 yuan has also been fully collected. The interest on the share capital amounted to 61.13 yuan. This share capital and interest have been deposited in the Hongkou branch of the Bank of China and Xinhua Bank, respectively. As for the funds for acquiring assets and decorations, not all have been paid yet. The establishment cost is 3,201.94 yuan. (7) Discussion of proposals: A. Discussion of the company's articles of association. Resolution: The draft was approved with amendments, with no dissent. (8) Election of directors and supervisors: A. Elected directors: Fang Yexian (2,997 votes), Cai Shengbai (2,789 votes), Ren Shigang (2,788 votes), Wang Zhixin (2,746 votes), Fang Jiangge (2,691 votes), Ye Youcai (2,480 votes), Pan Yangyao (2,382 votes), Shi Liangcai (2,000 votes), Zhang Huikang (1,943 votes). Next highest votes: Xu Yangnan (987 votes), Xiang Kangyuan (559 votes), Huang Shoumin (508 votes), Wang Boyuan (484 votes), Mu Ouchu (424 votes). B. Elected supervisors: Cheng Nianpeng (1,768 votes), Huang Yanfang (1,557 votes). Next highest votes: Xu Guanqun (438 votes), Xiang Kangyuan (347 votes), Wang Zhenfang (251 votes). (9) Investigation report by the elected directors and supervisors: A. All 5,000 shares have been fully subscribed. B. The payable share capital of 100,000 yuan has been paid in full at one time. C. None of the shareholders used property other than cash to pay for their shares. D. The establishment expenses borne by the company are legitimate. E. The initiators did not receive any special remuneration.</p>
<h3>Country Bumpkin</h3>
<p>— Shen Youshi</p>
<p>I am just a commoner; how am I qualified to say nonsensical things in this large Shen Bao National Goods Weekly? However, I see many celebrities publishing very valuable articles in the National Goods Weekly, which unconsciously makes me envious and I want to say a few words to relieve my boredom. Fortunately, "The rise and fall of the nation is the responsibility of every individual." I will speak from the perspective of a commoner.</p>
<p>I am a country person, someone who eats chalk dust, a primary school teacher despised by everyone. When I go to the city, especially Shanghai, everyone unanimously says, "Country bumpkin." Because my clothes are entirely made of homespun cloth, I am bestowed with this elegant nickname. Mr. Yinge says, "This is the psychology of national subjugation." But in the countryside, who dares to call me a country bumpkin? Therefore, the countryside does not have this psychology of national subjugation. So, the nation is being subjugated in the cities, not in the countryside!</p>
<p>What truly surprises me is that when Mr. Wu Zhihui wears homespun clothes, people praise him for promoting national goods. However, when I wear them, it has the opposite effect!</p>
<p>I understand! They are important figures, and we are insignificant fleas. Insignificant fleas are not worthy of saving the nation; important figures are the ones who should save the nation!</p>
<p>That's not right! I am clearly promoting national goods; I am saving the nation, but people scold me, and those who scold me are so-called enlightened city people. Alas! The nation is being ruined by you city people, especially those important figures! Otherwise, why would Mr. Wu be praised so profusely for promoting national goods? Country people promote national goods every day, but who says they are patriotic?</p>
<p>Also, the editor of the National Goods Weekly says, "The bride and groom must use national goods before I will be their wedding witness..." What is so strange about that! Look at the country people; people get married every day wearing homespun cloth. Who praises them? It is clear that city people use foreign goods, especially the important figures. If someone happens to wear homespun cloth, they are greatly surprised! I cannot help but sigh again, "China is being ruined by those people!"</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the more knowledgeable people are, the more they sing about promoting national goods. I hope – and this is a harsh saying – that each of them can refrain from using foreign goods themselves!</p>
<p>These words may offend many city people, and the editor will probably just smile coldly and throw them in the wastepaper basket. But the facts are so clear and obvious, and because a commoner also has the responsibility to save the nation, I have written them out after class despite the laborious effort. If anyone sympathizes with me, that is my only hope! I hope anyone with brilliant ideas will offer their advice!</p>

<p>K&gt; Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Ice Talk</h3>
<p>— Zhanlu</p>
<p>Gusts of north wind harden the soft and warm water of Jiangnan. Do you say it "flows east when directed east, flows west when directed west"? It actually fiercely battles the hardened north wind, "It is easier to shake a mountain than to shake a harbor frozen with ice!" The more tightly the north wind presses, the more solid the position becomes, as unshakeable as steel and iron! It is a tough guy, a desperate resister! It can deal with the harsh north wind, but it cannot deal with the gentle spring breeze. With just a slight breeze, hey! It cannot control itself! Like a Chu song scattering the 8,000 soldiers of Xiang Yu, the solid group dissolves! Its attitude changes! It is no longer ice but water! Its face rises and falls with the wind! It can become a whirlpool or a ripple as it pleases. It is a weakling! It is a believer in non-resistance! Alas! Where has the tough attitude of before gone?</p>
<p>In the moment when drops of water first freeze into ice, all the bottles, pots, jars, hair, and scattered glassware are like corrupt officials, big and small, who, upon hearing the order to investigate, quickly try to smuggle out the ill-gotten gains they have embezzled! All the water stored in their bellies expresses their innate and utterly clean nature through vomiting, spitting, pouring, and emptying. If the vomiting and emptying are delayed for even a moment, hey! How terrible! Once the embezzled goods expand, even the seven-stone jar that boasts "greatness within" will burst its big belly into three or five pieces! I wish to make that shattered seven-stone jar a mirror for corrupt officials.</p>
<p>I do not smoke water pipes, dry pipes, or any tobacco. However, an old gentleman in the same room hugs this white metal water pipe like Zhaoyun carrying A Dou. I hear him muttering to himself, "In such cold weather, everyone is shrinking their necks and not raising their heads, but you are raising your head? Aren't you afraid of the cold? Don't you need to wear an otter fur coat and a woolen scarf?" I ask strangely, "Old brother, who is raising their head there?" He answers with a smile, "My water pipe is frozen. The foolish, wife-like pipe head is extending its neck half an inch higher than usual."</p>
<h3>The Gathering of the Masses</h3>
<p>— Ren Ying</p>
<p>Around the Great World during the Lunar New Year</p>
<p>This area is usually bustling, but it becomes even more so during the Lunar New Year. Groups of laborers who sell their labor can get three or four days of rest. Near the Great World, crowds surge like waves. They spend the whole year depleting their blood and strength, and now they are searching for the precious entertainment that they have for a few days, like dew in the desert.</p>
<p>The cement ground opposite the Great World is filled with teams of Shandong performers. There are peep shows that have been exposed, puppet shows inside blue cloth curtains, strange cries, and rhythmic gongs. Outside the circle, groups of people crane their necks and wait. The iron gates in front of the Great World have already been pulled shut; they are probably putting on a show of being full. A group of prostitutes waiting for customers in the cold night wind are gradually appearing. Red robes, green jackets, white face powder, red rouge – in the eyes of the laboring masses, these are objects of sexual pursuit. But in the eyes of the city's young masters, these are terrifying demons. A group of bored hooligans throw firecrackers wrapped in colored paper at the feet of ladies. Resentful faces are exchanged for the hooligans' ferocious smiles.</p>
<p>The game of three cards also appears on the side of the road. There are gentle shouts and the clinking of silver coins. A group of people crowd around the wooden stall, and friends wearing peaked caps and leggings guard the outside of the circle. Some middle-aged women put a copper coin into the container for the fortune-telling sticks of the God of Wealth. Passing by several store entrances, I see them pasted with peach-colored Spring Festival couplets. The sound of the New Year drum, which I loved to hear as a child, ripples out from the door seams. Looking westward, a bright red setting sun reflects the blood flowers of the January 28th Incident martyrs.</p>
<h3>Facial</h3>
<p>— Xianxian</p>
<p>| Can Save the Country |</p>
<p>At the end of the lunar year, it is said that corrupt compatriots should go to the barber shop for a facial to sweep away the bad luck of the year. As someone who has been baptized, but who still faces the ancestral tablets of my ancestors and worships the gods as if they were present, I naturally cannot avoid this practice because of the "annual old rule, double the price for each customer."</p>
<p>In the large mirror of this barber shop, I see my own reflection, feeling sorry for myself and unable to bear to teach. From the forehead down to the corner of the eye, I feel that a few strands of facial hair, neither clear nor thoughtful, are somewhat embarrassing and very unsightly. Looking at the comrades on either side, they also have hedgehog-like facial hair. So I arbitrarily prove that our great</p>
<h3>Joke</h3>
<p>In the primary school, the teacher in geography class asked the student to point to the location of the world on the map.</p>
<p>Teacher: "Zhao, you come up to the podium. Where is America? Point it out!"</p>
<p>Zhao: "Here."</p>
<p>Teacher: "Yes, go down!"</p>
<p>Teacher: "Everyone, do you know who discovered America?"</p>
<p>Wang: Hastily got up and said, "It was Zhao!"</p>
<p>Teacher: "Zhao pointed out America on the map. Columbus discovered America." (Rui)</p>
<p>The people of China, although they are not all the same, the facial hair of the people are "ten thousand people with one style." Because of the Chinese habit of shaving every morning, "man is the spirit of all things", how can one say "man is not as good as a dog"? Inevitably insulting the dignity of man. Although the facts tell us that man is indeed not as good as a dog!</p>
<p>We know that a dog who gets the favor of his master is like the pride of heaven. Not only does the diet pay attention to, | beef and biscuits | but also the living is comfortable, | Western-style house and garden | Sometimes its master goes out in a car, then it is especially lucky, because following its master, it can actually sit in the car. When we walk on the road, we sometimes see many cars speeding by, and there is such a car. In addition to the master sitting upright and the driver driving, there is also a "big" crouching on it, glaring at everything. I think how many people in the world are really ashamed of it! This is a fact that "man is not as good as a dog".</p>
<p>The second fact is that dogs are loyal. It is said that horses, sheep, tigers, and dogs are loyal, filial, chaste, and righteous. Then, in today's world, anyone who is unfaithful, unfilial, unchaste, and unrighteous is not only inferior to a dog, but also inferior to a horse, a sheep, or a tiger! However, since I am talking about "man is not as good as a dog," I will naturally still talk about dogs. The dog's righteousness lies in its ability to fulfill its duty to guard its master, in return for its master's feeding. Like the dogs in the Three Family Village, when they see their master coming from outside the village, they know to bark and chase after him.</p>
<p>Novel</p>
<h3>Taking Pictures</h3>
<p>— Mo Yi</p>
<p>In the weather outside the customs, there is almost no difference between autumn and winter; the scorching summer is driven away by the bleak autumn wind, and the unique northwest wind of winter roars like a knife scraping needles. The sky-filled yellow sand rolls in the sky like waves in the ocean; and the snowflakes hidden in the layers of dark clouds, after a few days of northwest wind, when the mercury on the thermometer drops below zero, it sweeps away the yellow sand and dances in the air. A thick layer of snow accumulates on the ground, first frozen by the northwest wind, as if covering the ground with a layer of marble, and then the sky clears, and the warm sun shoots out its heat, harmonizing the air everywhere, and the snow melts, and it is simply impossible to insert a foot on the muddy road; but when the sun is forced away by the night, or another layer of snow is added, it freezes again, and it freezes and melts alternately, until the original ground can be seen in March and April of the following year.</p>
<p>One morning after four or five days of heavy snow, the sun climbed up from the horizon, not with the usual smile, and the faint sunlight seemed to be worried about its appearance. The people in Lizigou Village, Fushun County, did not dare to sleep because they heard gunfire and shouting all night last night. When they got up early this morning, their faces were full of surprised expressions, and they gathered in twos and threes to guess the source of the gunfire and shouting last night.</p>
<p>"Didn't you all sleep last night?" Zhang Rongjiu sat on the porch of his house with his neighbors Wang Fugen and Zhao Da, basking in the sun, and said, flicking off the ashes from his cigarette.</p>
<p>"How dare I sleep! Didn't you hear gunfire all night! What about you?" Wang Fugen lit a cigarette and took two strong puffs.</p>
<p>"It was so lively all night, and I don't know what happened?" Zhao Da stared at the circles of smoke coming out of Wang Fugen's nostrils and mouth and said.</p>
<p>"I think it must be the Volunteer Army fighting the dwarves all night again!"</p>
<p>"That's right. I don't know how the victory or defeat is?"</p>
<p>"By the way, weren't there three ......" Zhao Da said as if he remembered something. Halfway through, he saw a stranger limping in, stepping on the slightly melting snow, and didn't say anything else.</p>
<p>"Please ... ... please ... ... you ... ... me ... ... for a while, oh ... ... it hurts ... ... it hurts oh ... ..." the sudden man shouted with a pale face and gritted teeth, very painfully.</p>
<p>The three of them stood up together, ran over to help the man, and sat him down on the porch. The three of them stood around him. (One)</p>
<p>I can guarantee that 99% of people don't want to develop them at all.</p>
<p>After saying so much nonsense about getting in the car, if I haven't talked about "facial", how can it "save the country". Well, I have my 18th heretical reason.</p>
<p>Although the foreign devils have a body odor, they have an irreconcilable hatred for the facial hair of the lower class. As soon as they open their eyes, they shave it clean with a razor. Even if they leave a small tuft of mustache on the philtrum, they must shave the facial hair outside the area so that not a blade of grass is left. Therefore, 90% of the white race is a strong country. We Chinese have the habit of shaving facial hair only when we cut our hair. | "Man is the spirit of all things", how can we say "man is not as good as a dog"? It is inevitable to insult the dignity of man. Although the facts tell us that man is indeed not as good as a dog!</p>
<p>The white Russian wanderers living in Shanghai never trim their facial hair, they have no motherland. The facial hair of the Indian black charcoal is even more scary, they are slaves of the British. What about the Chinese who don't shave their face?</p>
<p>Compatriots, if you want to save the country, quickly make "facial" the first lesson in the morning.</p>
<h3>Man Is Not As Good As A Dog Yiyiguan Master</h3>
<p>| Comparison of Two Facts |</p>
<p>. The bold are shocked by it! The timid are scared away by it! As for people? They usually enjoy all the rights, but when something happens, they don't know to fulfill any obligations! Now that the country is in distress, and the enemy has arrived, the only ones who can resist are a few volunteer armies! The others are either "traitors" or "profiteers." How can these people be compared to a dog? Alas! In short, man is indeed not as good as a dog!</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Notes</p>
<h3>Nine-Flavor Tea</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yian</p>
<p>We Cantonese people have a kind of medicine called "Nine-Flavor Tea." It's made of many odds and ends of medicines combined together, including even old cow dung and broken bowls. (This is the truth.) Strictly speaking, a complete dose of Nine-Flavor Tea has more than nine ingredients, so it is also known as "Odds-and-Ends Tea." But the original Nine-Flavor Tea probably only had nine ingredients, and it was gradually increased by later additions.</p>
<p>It is said that this Nine-Flavor Tea can cure many ailments, especially colds, indigestion, and so on. According to my experience, it is often quite effective for intestinal problems, but it may not work for other problems. The medicine is not formulated by famous doctors or experts, and many of its ingredients are not found in the Materia Medica, and it is so miscellaneous. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, and the taste is bitter and unpleasant. I think it is quite similar to this article of mine, so I took it as the name. Although this article is as miscellaneous as Nine-Flavor Tea, I don't guarantee that its usefulness is equivalent. I hereby declare this in advance.</p>
<p>It is very disappointing when a burst of joy suddenly cannot be realized. Indeed, people should always strive towards their desired goals, one step at a time, and should not be discouraged by any failures. I myself have been fooled by hope many times... After giving it my best effort, the result often dissipated like a soap bubble. Having had such experiences many times, I am no longer so daring to trust hope. Hope exists, but I don't dare to expect it to have the result that I have predetermined. Just do my best to do it, and don't necessarily be discouraged. When the time comes, whatever the result, just let it be. For example, when planning whether to succeed at the time, obstacles of time and people must be expected to occur. If you can consider this in advance, you can reduce a lot of disappointment and sadness at the time. This attitude seems close to the indifference of middle age and the loss of the vigor of youth. But experience tells you to do so, so why should you force yourself to go against nature and deceive yourself? Experience is the most scientific. (Mao Dun's "Disillusionment" seems to describe this kind of mentality.)</p>
<p>When I arrived in Wuxi, I got some impressions:</p>
<p>A friend who had lived there for a few months accompanied us on our tour and tried to show off his knowledge of Wuxi everywhere. For example, when hiring rickshaws, he deliberately negotiated the price down to the lowest possible amount for us. In fact, we may not be ignorant of the things he wanted to show off.</p>
<p>Perhaps because I was thirsty, I found the tea brewed with Huiquan water particularly delicious. If Huiquan water is really so good, I must bring a dozen or so thermos bottles to transport some back to Shanghai next time.</p>
<p>Two rickshaw pullers fought with their fists against their colleagues for a ride. This may be a small symbol of the struggle for survival.</p>
<p>It is rare to have new experiences sitting at home. If you want to get some new experiences, you must go out the door, the farther the better.</p>
<p>The smell of the sun scorching the wild grass is something that people in the city cannot smell. Most of them only smell coal smoke.</p>
<p>Because the rickshaw puller was rushing to grab business, he pulled the wrong rickshaw of a colleague, and was caught up by that rickshaw puller, which delayed me and made me fall behind.</p>
<p>In the city park, there were slogans in large black characters on white "foreign" cloth, and paper strips that were still posted saying "Guest Registration" and "Ladies' Reception." Several workers were moving chairs out of the park, and part of the park was obviously a bit messy. I thought this must be a meeting of some kind, and the meeting period had already passed, and this was a scene after the meeting. The next day, I learned from the newspaper that a certain member of the party and a certain lady held their wedding ceremony there. So I said you must go out and see to get new experiences.</p>

<h3>Red Plate Rice Prices Rise About Half a Dollar</h3>
<p>｜Yin Yuan Goods Scarce, Exceptionally Good Yuan Score｜</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday's source was thirty to forty loads, the total accumulation in Pudong was over a hundred loads, and the urban and rural shops were still smooth, totaling three to four thousand shi. The packaging stack merchants, after Shanghai changed to using new measuring instruments, have many difficulties with the Tianjin bucket, so they are still under discussion and are expected to be handled around the eleventh or twelfth of this month. The market is firmer than last year. The rice prices of Su Tong gang and Nangang Qingjiao, etc., have risen by four jiao, and Du Yangjian has also increased by one or two jiao. Yin Yuan has risen by one yuan due to the scarcity of goods. The Chang gang source has not arrived, and there is no market.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Since the rice industry agreed to change to the new municipal dou system, the North Shanghai market has various procedures that are not yet proper, resulting in not opening the dou. Although there is a slight opening, they have not been released. There are about thirty-two ships and new arrivals stored downstream, with a total of three thousand shi of rice. Each stack stores about fifty to sixty thousand shi of white粳, and each factory stores over fifty thousand shi of Jian. There are several thousand shi of Yangjian and Baiyuan on the score. Yesterday, the North Shanghai gang's white 粳 closed at six or seven jiao higher than last year's sea dou price, early rice increased by four or five jiao, Yin Bian Yuan increased by two or three jiao, and factory machine Jian was priced at forty-four jiao five fen. Factory machine Yangjian increased by six or seven jiao, and the rest also saw increases.</p>
<h3>Ke Xian Prices Fall and Sales are Brisk</h3>
<p>Price Drops Another Small Jiao... Minhua Exceptionally Prosperous</p>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival of Ke Xian was not prosperous. Because various producing areas heard that national circulation did not require passport fees, people's hearts were uplifted, and they all collected and hoarded. Therefore, the production price was instead firm and it was difficult to make profitable sales. However, in Shanghai, foreign rice and Du rice squeezed each other's feet, and the market was difficult to improve for a while. Moreover, Du rice downstream can be circulated to various ports across the country starting yesterday, without unnecessary procedures such as passports. Since rice from downstream can circulate smoothly, the market for Ke rice will inevitably be squeezed. Because rice merchants from Hunan and Jiangxi are all strongly advocating for early disposal, they no longer hold the attitude of guarding it like last winter. After the market opened in the morning, each Xian depreciated by a small jiao across the board. After the price decreased, the Min gang immediately handled it briskly. Local merchants and hoarders also took the opportunity to inquire, and the market became active. The overall market was handled by the Fuzhou gang from Fujian Province, going to Jiangxi with 1,270 packages of late machine rice, 800 packages of Hunan machine red rice, 500 packages of Hunan oil rice. Furthermore, Quanzhou sent 1,000 packages of Hunan oil rice. The local scattered households sent over 1,000 packages of Hunan oil rice and 300 packages of red rice. The market prices were each about a small jiao lower. Hunan machine oil rice was priced from 9 yuan 1 jiao 7 fen to 8 yuan 9 jiao, and machine red rice was priced from 8 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen to 8 yuan 6 jiao 5 fen. Jiangxi machine late rice was priced from 8 yuan 9 jiao 5 fen to 8 yuan 8 jiao 5 fen, it is said.</p>
<h3>Standard Flour Fluctuates Unpredictably</h3>
<p>｜July Already Opened Auction as Usual｜</p>
<p>Yesterday in the flour market, the morning initially showed fatigue and stopped at a flat price. Although the quoted price of foreign wheat was slightly better by a few fen, due to the ultimately small actual sales, inquiries decreased, and people's hearts inevitably felt weak. Therefore, this month's opening price of five fen soon dropped to the lowest record of four fen two and a half li since the market stopped. Later, due to slight transactions from Ke gang and some empty accounts covering their positions, it rose again to five fen two and a half li. Due to the fluctuations in the current month, the opening prices for each month in the future were also slightly firm. Due to the small number of those leaving the market, the hearts of people in the current month are again positive, reaching a high of six fen two and a half li. However, closing empty, it fell again. Observing this kind of spiraling situation, a definitive evaluation will have to wait until Ke gang has formal transactions. As a result, the current month was slightly smaller by two and a half li, March remained unchanged, April was three one and a half li, May was slightly smaller by two and a half li, June was slightly smaller by five li, and July had already opened auction as usual. The initial price was one tael seven qian seven fen two and a half li, and the closing was also slightly smaller by five li, it is said.</p>
<h3>Futures Wheat Steps Downstream</h3>

Foreign wheat will arrive at the port this month, and deliveries are more forceful. The opening price has already decreased to three taels, and the closing price was three taels three qian seven fen, which is seven fen lower than the previous day. March and April shrank by two fen. Over these three days, the prices for each month have uniformly fallen, and have not stopped at all. The three-day decline has also been fierce, with each month cumulatively decreasing by one qian four fen and one qian two or three fen. The July contract opened for the first time today, and the afternoon closing price was also four fen lower than the intraday price. Spot and futures prices for foreign wheat both showed slight increases, and settlements were temporarily reached in a satisfactory manner.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains Market Shows Uneven Fatigue and Strength</h3>
<p>Raw peanuts have accumulated in large quantities. Because the Guang gang's calculations are not profitable, trading has weakened. Even if there are transactions, they take high and kill low. The local retail households and rural villages are tight on peanuts, so the intake is strong, and the market situation is improving. Yellow soybeans only slightly moved for local sauce blending and inland areas, resulting in a soft market shape. Although Shantou and Ningbo gangs made inquiries, the appetite was not large, and the market was difficult to revitalize. The Guang gang has already started purchasing large-sized mustard greens and mung beans. Small materials only had a small number of transactions with Shantou and Xiamen gangs.</p>
<h3>Chicago Wheat Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>On Tuesday, Chicago wheat first fell due to unfavorable news from Liverpool, and then rose due to winter wheat estimates favoring long positions. Furthermore, a total of ten million bushels were traded on the 30th. The market prices on the 31st are listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>

<p>Oil Market</p>
<h3>Overview of Cottonseed Oil Factory Operations Last Year</h3>
<p>Cooperation Effective in the First Half, Rapeseed Concurrently Operated in the Second Half</p>
<p>Dayou, Dachang, etc., Each Had Surpluses of 30,000 to 56,000</p>
<p>The number of cottonseed oil pressing factories in this port is only six or seven, but the raw material demand has always been greater than the supply. Last year, the number of cotton blossoms was poor, and the output was not strong. Cottonseed was even more in short supply. Fortunately, on the import side, the industry cooperated to jointly establish a raw material procurement office to purchase. The prices were also determined by the office according to the market, so the cottonseed price did not jump out of line. The oil cakes were stable due to the limited output. Therefore, although the oil factory operations in the first half of last year were affected by the Shanghai war, they were able to avoid significant losses due to the industry cooperation. Last autumn, the harvest of cotton blossoms was quite abundant, but the new factory Hengxingtai was established as a non-member, becoming an opponent to the procurement office. This was because many of the factory's shareholders were flower-ginning factories in Pudong. Therefore, after its establishment, Pudong cottonseed was almost completely monopolized. The amount of cotton used in Pudong accounts for 20% of the total amount used by each factory, and therefore, the factories suffered from a shortage of goods again. The factory machines could not be fully operated and only produced oil cakes to maintain operations. As a result, the factories faced difficulties in producing oil cakes, and Dayou took the lead in producing rapeseed to maintain operations. According to this settlement, Dayou and Dachang, etc., each had surpluses ranging from 10,000 to 56,000. It is said that they profited from producing rapeseed. The other factories barely broke even. Because of its superior position, Shanghai Oil also had a surplus of 30,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Oil Market Red Plate Also Rises</h3>
<p>Both Crude Oil and Finished Oil Have Opened</p>
<p>The soybean oil red plate market opened yesterday for the first time, and prices were traded according to the new municipal measurement system. Each oil price was about a few qian higher than before the market closed. Because this is the red plate market's compensation trading, it is still bustling. Later, it may be difficult to maintain, because the source of goods is accumulating. Yesterday, the market only sold about one-third of the opening, so the later market must be revised and reduced.</p>
<p>Clear oil also rose slightly. 700 dan were traded yesterday, and over 2,000 dan of shelled flowers were traded at a price of four jiao. The above were all bought by local merchants.</p>
<p>2,000 dan of crude oil cakes were traded at a price of two taels two qian five fen.</p>
<p>North and South Goods</p>
<h3>Jinshan Branch Store Plate Turns Upward</h3>
<p>The Jinshan branch's first plate in the North Shanghai Guang gang store opened yesterday. The price of top-grade yuan branches was 23 taels and a half to 21 taels, and the price of ordinary yuan branches was 21 taels 8 qian to 21 taels. This is an increase of one tael to five qian compared to last winter. Furthermore, 50 pieces of ordinary yuan meat were opened at a price of 22 taels 8 qian. The plates of other Jian gangs have not yet been exchanged, it is said.</p>
<p>Sugar Market</p>
<h3>Coarse Granulated Sugar Dump Price Steps Down</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to weaken due to the weakening of the bidding price, and the trend turned downward. In addition, the dumping price of coarse sugar from foreign firms in February and March differed by as much as one jiao to five fen between the morning and afternoon. In the morning, Dachang opened at a new regulation price of four yuan two jiao two and a half fen in Dutch currency, Tianxiang was four yuan two and a half fen, and Sassoon and Shunquanlong were all four yuan two jiao, with many transactions. By the afternoon, Yongxing opened again with 300 tons of goods to be loaded in February and March at a price of four yuan one jiao and a half in Dutch currency. Therefore, the goods obtained by each firm in the morning all needed price deductions that had not yet been resolved. After this impact, people's hearts were unstable. Therefore, the association only allocated hundreds of packages of 24 coarse sugar white, priced at fifteen taels seven qian, down seven and a half fen from the previous day. The remaining 20 medium sugar white and 8 and 9 Dutch red were still quoted at the original price, but there were no buyers, resulting in no transactions. The goods stored by the Chao Qing gang were previously agreed upon in the previous days, but the Chao gang still needed to pass the general meeting. Therefore, the Chaozhou Guild Hall held a full meeting yesterday for retrospective recognition, and it adjourned late at night. The exchange should begin trading on the store’s plate today, it is said.</p>
<p>Business Sutra (II)</p>
<h3>Doors for Acquiring Western Suits</h3>
<h3>Western Suits</h3>
<p>。Because there are more stores, the pricing is relatively fair. It is important to pay attention and bargain. It is best to visit several stores to compare. After the sample is sold, pay the deposit slowly. First cut a small sample, and add to it the next day. In order to take samples to other stores for comparison. ㈡ When looking at the sample, be sure to recognize whose sample it is. You can take the small sample to that place to inquire. (A phone call is also fine.) When inquiring, be sure to first ask for the sample number with a discount. How many discounts are there in cash? Then how much money is needed for this clothing fabric? Even if you want to cheat, it will no longer be possible. Benefit tailors often overcalculate the material needed, profiting from it. To make a suit, in reality, you need two yards and seventy-five inches of material. They must say that they need three yards. Smart customers do not need to have them buy it for them. Buy the material yourself. At most, buy two yards and eight inches. Adding a little extra is enough. If you let the tailor buy it for you, they will not only want to make money, but also want to profit from the material. With each layer adding profit, the customer suffers twice. ㈣ If you find it troublesome to buy the material yourself, you can also go to the Xiaoximen, Daxin Street, and Wusong Road areas to buy ready-made goods. Because the area there is small and the expenses are less, business is more accommodating than in other places. Although the workmanship is slightly inferior, there should be a special difference, and the price is much cheaper. However, careful inspection is still essential.</p>
<h3>Overcoats</h3>
<p>For Western-style overcoats, of course, it is most appropriate to have them made at a Western-style clothing store. Because their style and workmanship are more beautiful than other overcoat workshops. For making Chinese-style overcoats, if you want to be economical, you can go to Daxin Street, Qipan Street, Wusong Road, and Xiaoximen areas to buy them. The prices are relatively cheaper. However, even though the price heard is cheap, you still need to bargain. It should be about several yuan. It is best to visit several stores to avoid being taken advantage of even in a cheap deal. After the price is agreed upon, specify what kind of goods the lining and interlining are. The lining can be satin or camel hair. The quality of the two is different, so you must choose carefully. Black charcoal interlining is the best. If not specified, Ningbo Jiangshan interlining will be used. Also, for a French-style interlining, do not use cloth lining. (Some dishonest stores will say it is French-style interlining when ordering, but change to using summer cloth lining and hemp sackcloth, etc., when making it.) The sleeve lining must be genuine silk. Horsehair interlining prices vary greatly between genuine and fake. Genuine goods sell for two yuan per yard, while fake goods only sell for six jiao. After everything is specified and a deal is made, you must take samples. (Note). The sample of the clothing material should be slightly larger, so that you can compare it with the finished clothing. Otherwise, sometimes the comparison will not be clear, and the store will cheat you, leaving you with no way to argue. If you buy the material yourself and give it to a tailor to make, the labor and parts will cost about thirteen or fourteen yuan per piece. (Including lining, interlining, pocket cloth, buttons, etc.) When buying the overcoat material, you must accurately calculate your length and size. If you are short, you cannot add more. If there is too much, it is good for the tailor, and it is not worth it. For example, if your height is three feet six or seven inches, you can cut two yards and eight inches of overcoat wool. If a robe is three feet eight or nine inches, you can cut three yards. Beyond four feet, you need three yards and one "gua du" (i.e., two inches and a half). This is all calculated using the latest style of "ben ku" sleeves. If it is the old-fashioned round sleeve, you can save one or two "jiao" of material.</p>
<h3>Rulers</h3>
<p>The rulers used by the industry to measure the length of cloth are mostly made by themselves. However, when necessary, you should still rely on the Deji, Huaji, and Tianyou rulers. Thirty-six inches is counted as one yard. Each yard is divided into ten "jiao." Each "jiao" is three inches and six points, totaling two inches and a half in the center. Two and a half "jiao" is called one "gua du" (Quarter) by Westerners. Seven and a half "jiao" is three "gua du", exactly twelve inches and seven and a half points, which is half a yard. (However, the cloth industry often says that two feet and six inches is one yard. In reality, it is measured by 98 feet when folding people's clothing.) Two feet and five and a half inches is one yard. Within a yard, there are still differences of 125, 25, 375, 625, and 75.</p>

<h3>The Melting of Snow (2)</h3>
<p>– Xu Jie</p>
<p>I knocked on the water surface, it only revealed some white flowers, it was almost harder than a stone slab. I shook the water tank, and there was no moving water at the bottom of the tank. As for the little fish, some of them were frozen white before being solidified; some were frozen quietly and motionless in mid-air, just like when they were swimming; and some had their little tails curved, showing a gesture of trying to turn around. However, everything was solidified, frozen. Moreover, everything was clearly and transparently displayed before my eyes, so that I could see clearly. I suddenly felt sad. I felt as if I was also frozen in this ice world, and I cried, I cried very sadly.</p>
<p>I think you can imagine this situation to some extent, even if you haven't experienced it! Gentlemen, in this weather, our bodies and souls are also frozen like this!</p>
<p>Take a look at the weather these past few days. Indeed, a few days ago, our eaves also dripped water, and the snow water was melting drop by drop, which made us feel quite energetic. However, the situation these past few days is clearly before our eyes. Isn't the snow water in front of our eaves melting a little and dripping a few drops during the day, only to refreeze again at night, and even have more snow added on top?</p>
<p>In the past few days, because some people were still making fires to keep warm, some people were chatting idly, and even because some people were still living and hadn't stopped breathing, a few drops of water could still drip during the day, indicating a sign that the snow would soon collapse. But now, even if some people are still making fires and breathing, they can't make the severe ice and snow disappear even a little. If this continues, wouldn't you think that even fires won't start in the future? Wouldn't you think that even your breath will be frozen, and you won't be able to exhale freely anymore?</p>
<p>Of course, we know that spring and warmth, which will save us from the misfortune of this harsh winter, will arrive sooner or later. However, in today's world, where both body and soul are frozen in ice and snow, it is very difficult to endure even a minute or a second. Moreover, in these anxious days of waiting for spring to arrive, we will feel particularly that these days are hard to get through, and we may even suspect that spring will never come. Friends, please imagine, in my little fish, the few little fish that froze to death in the snow, in their posture of struggling with their tails curved, in their relaxed posture of stretching their chests and evenly balancing their limbs, did they ever think that spring would eventually come?</p>
<p>This is the truth. Even if spring really arrives one day, our current lives will not be able to last until spring, so what then? If spring only arrives after your own life has ended, do you believe that spring has arrived, or has it never arrived?</p>
<p>Melting snow is colder than falling snow. What's more, the current snow is melting and falling again, melting and falling again, and it has been completely frozen together, with ice on the snow and snow on the ice!</p>
<p>The weather like this is indeed extremely severe, but it is not appropriate to just wait and be frozen in this frozen world, unable to breathe. We Chinese have an old saying, "Everyone sweeps the snow in front of their own door." I think we should do the work of sweeping the snow in front of our own doors ourselves! We still need to do some snow-sweeping work, we need to stretch our breath a little.</p>
<p>Ah, "Melting snow is colder than falling snow," what harsh weather!</p>
<p>January 5, 1933</p>
<h3>George Bernard Shaw and John Galsworthy</h3>
<p>— Yu Dafu</p>
<p>We were preparing to warmly welcome the long-faced prophet Old Shaw, but unfortunately, we received the obituary of last year's Nobel Prize winner, John Galsworthy. Shaw is seventy-six years old this year. Galsworthy was sixty-five years old this year.</p>
<p>In principle, sixty-five years old is not considered a premature death, but if this precise recorder of the British upper class, who came from a legal background, had not died, he might have produced several more masterpieces in the future to report to us on the shaking and changes of the British upper class. Galsworthy's literary achievements are not only the Forsyte Saga, but also the Silver Box, Strife, Justice, and The Mob, which will be immortalized. Even his discovery of the naval writer Conrad during a trip to the South Seas in 1893 should occupy a place in the history of English literature. Although he came from a relatively upper-class background, his attitude of always speaking for humanity and criticizing society is one that we must give full respect even in this era of changing times and turbulent tides.</p>
<p>Conversely, Shaw's attitude toward society is different. At first, it seems that he is just joking and not taking things seriously, but after closing your eyes and thinking, or after laughing and turning your mind, you can immediately discover that every joke and scolding of this long-faced old man is a shot in the arm aimed at the crux of society. Well said, Joseph McCabe, who criticized Shaw, saying, "He does not say epigrams, but he himself is an epigram. He is the most moral immoralist, the most altruistic egoistic preacher, the purest denier of the Ten Commandments, and the most serious humorist." Isn't this a very appropriate assessment of Shaw?</p>
<p>Once, an actress famous in Europe and America for her beauty said to him, "Mr. Shaw, if you marry me and have a child, with my appearance and your brains, wouldn't that child be the most beautiful and intelligent person in the world?" Shaw said, "What if the appearance looks like mine and the brains look like yours? That would be terrible!"</p>
<p>Countless witty remarks like this have been made during Shaw's seventy-six years. I remember when he went to Russia for a visit, even Stalin had to acknowledge him as a junior of Marxism, because he said, "I studied Marx long before Lenin." At that time, the capitalist countries of Europe were publicizing the inhumane forced labor of Soviet Russia, but Shaw said to the Russians, "I wish that such inhumane phenomena would occur in Europe and America, otherwise, where would those millions of unemployed workers find a way out?"</p>
<p>Fortunately, we in China still have Mr. Lu Xun, who can be compared with George Bernard Shaw. People are scolding him for using the old trick of the Shaoxing scribe to kill people with a few words, but George Bernard Shaw is not from Jingshan, is he? February 1, 1932.</p>
<h3>Quick Sketch on the Shanghai-Wuxi Route</h3>
<p>— Huang Zengrong</p>
<p>"Finally, I see smoke!" So, the people standing at the bottom seemed to have taken an stimulant. They yawned, stretched their waists, and each picked up their belongings, preparing for the upcoming squeeze. The women were still cursing the train's delay, which had made them wait for two hours.</p>
<p>The police also began to work. They carried wooden sticks and stood on the platforms on both sides of the tracks, warning people to step back a little. Occasionally, when they encountered one or two ignorant villagers, hum! The wooden sticks would be applied to their bodies and say an unlucky sentence: "Looking for death?"</p>
<p>The train rushed into the platform. It was not easy to squeeze into the third-class carriage, but it was already full of people standing. A gentleman in a suit was lying comfortably sideways. According to the people next to him, this gentleman came from Zhenjiang, maybe it was for "official business," or maybe he was an "important person"! Wasn't he? He was also pillowing a "official business briefcase" under his head! So everyone dared not argue with him, because they knew, "Official business" is always "official business," and "important people" are always "important people"!</p>
<p>The train was approaching Hushu Pass, and the ticket inspector came, followed by two military policemen, who were also very imposing. Oh! China's military police are only good enough to follow people and check tickets!</p>
<p>When the ticket inspector came to the lying gentleman, he put on a very solemn look and told him to get up. Of course, the gentleman in the suit would not submit. The ticket inspector's reason was quite sufficient, he said,</p>
<p>"If you don't get up, you will have to pay for two more tickets." Indeed, he was simply occupying the space of three people. The gentleman in the suit finally sat up, probably because he didn't want to pay for the extra tickets. However, in order to save his own face, after the ticket inspector left, he looked at the ticket inspector's back and cursed, "Damn it." This was of course blaming the ticket inspector for not opening his eyes and not taking his "official business briefcase" seriously.</p>
<p>How uncomfortable the train was! The smoke was thick, it was really suffocating. An unknown gentleman said,</p>
<p>"Ah... smoking is really unhygienic!"</p>
<p>But the smokers glared at him.</p>
<p>The train went straight past Nanxiang! Of course, I felt more relieved in my heart. However, the smoke all around, mixed with the congestion of carbon dioxide exhaled by more than a hundred people, made me feel even more nervous and temporarily uncomfortable. Fortunately! Shanghai is almost here!</p>
<p>Shanghai has finally arrived! Ha! Finally arrived! I quickly jumped out of the carriage, as if I were a prisoner who had been pardoned.</p>
<h3>Model Collective Market</h3>
<p>— Native</p>
<p>From carrots to all sorts of things, a collective market like a glass palace, opened in Moscow in early October last year. This collective market is very outstanding. There is a nursery where people who go shopping can entrust their children. There is a rest room, a restaurant, ventilation equipment, a sanitary drinking fountain, and fire protection devices. As long as the sprinkler heads, which are very technically installed in the roof and walls, are turned on, any part of this large building will not be affected by other parts.</p>
<p>It is estimated that this first model collective market in Moscow can accommodate 8,000 customers at a time. Eighty-one stalls specialize in selling food from collective farms and state farms. A 300-meter-long counter sells various peasant products, from food to embroidered work clothes. In addition, there is a 200-meter-long counter that specializes in clothes, shoes, fabrics, and exquisite utensils. A doctor is always on site. Veterinarians and agricultural experts will inspect all the food sold.</p>
<p>The front of this novel building is decorated with statues of a man and a woman, leaning against an overturned basket, from which an endless stream of horticultural products flows. In front of this large building is a lawn with gardens and fountains.</p>
<p>Ulianiski, the person in charge of the construction, said that construction began on July 20, with an average of 450 people working on it every day. Since the start of construction, the construction plan has been changed, so the cost has increased from the budgeted 750,000 rubles to nearly 1.2 million rubles, and the scheduled time has been extended to complete this great work.</p>

<h3>The Crossroads of the Era and Love (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>"Just flipping through it a bit, not doing any deep research. Mr. Lin, you like reading novels, don't you?"</p>
<p>"I want to create. Because art is a symbol of distress... so when Shirakaba Kuson advocated it, some people quickly imported it."</p>
<p>"But, Mr. Lin, in modern times, that's no longer a fashionable slogan."</p>
<p>She said, tilting her head slightly, smiling as if amused.</p>
<p>"Ah, ah."</p>
<p>He felt his face getting hot. He wanted to ask her what she meant by "slogan," but he felt that if he asked, she would look down on him, so he just reacted with "Ah, ah," waiting for her to continue.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin, how do you think literature and art should be defined?"</p>
<p>"Literature and art are a reflection of society."</p>
<p>He answered her very quickly. He thought this would definitely win her external applause and internal admiration. But he still felt a little ashamed inside. Because this definition was something he had only wholesale purchased from those revolutionary literary figures a few nights ago. Now he wanted to retail a little of it to her.</p>
<p>"Ha, ha, ha! That's a little more advanced than before. But..."</p>
<p>He thought, this is really unexpected. "Literature and art are a reflection of society," is there a more fashionable definition than that? He felt a little unconvinced. He made up his mind to ask her.</p>
<p>"Then, is there a more fashionable definition?"</p>
<p>He asked her, pretending to be calm and smiling.</p>
<p>"Hee, hee, hee... Mr. Lin..."</p>
<p>This time, he concentrated and focused, wanting to seriously absorb some knowledge from this Mrs. Tsuruko.</p>
<p>"...What kind of tea is this? It's so fragrant and lovely!"</p>
<p>"How unreasonable!"</p>
<p>After cursing under his breath, he replied to her with three words, very unhappily, "Tieguanyin."</p>
<p>"What a beautiful name, so artistic, hee, hee, hee."</p>
<p>"What you just said about the definition of literature and art, what should it be like to be considered the most fashionable?"</p>
<p>"You're still thinking about that? Forget it, Mr. Lin. I don't understand it very well either. I saw it in a very ordinary Japanese magazine, *Fujin Kōron*. The definition of literature given by leftist writers is, 'the voice of labor,' you know."</p>
<p>"Isn't that just a type of social reflection?"</p>
<p>"That's not right, Mr. Lin. Although it is a reflection of society, reactionary literature should be excluded, you know. This is the most cutting-edge definition of literature. But I don't agree with such a narrow definition. Perhaps we haven't grasped Ideologie yet."</p>
<p>Haiquan thought, right, right. Ideologie! This is the term that Mr. Chen Huamin often mentioned when lecturing him on literary theory that night, and he didn't quite understand it yet. How does Mrs. Tsuruko also know about these things? He was stunned and didn't reply for a while.</p>

<p>Discussions</p>
<h3>Insisting on Being Seen Favorably</h3>
<p>— Bian</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. "Wu" discussed being seen favorably at Peking University, and his meaning was not yet exhausted. I will add to his explanation: the Japanese have not yet attacked Peiping and Tianjin, but the universities of Peiping are needlessly alarmed, with incidents such as fleeing the examinations and advancing the holidays. This kind of phenomenon is indeed inappropriate. It not only shows the cowardly mentality of our people and the authorities, making the enemy even more arrogant in their advance, but on the other hand, with the highest institutions of learning displaying such phenomena, people become even more shaken, and social order can hardly be maintained. Peiping universities should be seen favorably and should even more be seen favorably.</p>
<p>But recently, looking at the telegrams in the newspaper, the day before yesterday there was:</p>
<h3>"The Palace Museum Antiquities Are Packed and Ready to Be Transported South; Various Groups Still Decide to Oppose It."</h3>
<p>Yesterday's telegram had:</p>
<h3>"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Telegraphed that the Archives Preservation Office Will Transport Important Files to Luoyang for Preservation."</h3>
<p>This being the case, I cannot help but feel confused. On the one hand, the authorities do not allow students to flee the exams, do not allow the school authorities to advance the holidays, but on the other hand, they are packing up antiquities and archives to be transported south. It is true that antiquities and archives are quite important, and it is appropriate to transport them south as a precautionary measure to prevent unforeseen events. Is the life and property of students not worth half a cent? Assuming that they want to calm things down, how can they calm others if they themselves are not calm? Is this not an absolute contradiction?</p>
<p>I think that in any matter, there must first be a consistent approach. As the saying goes, "Without oneself being right, one cannot criticize others," and "Governing is not about many words, but about how vigorously one acts." Now, the national crisis is at hand. Rumors about Tianjin and Peiping will inevitably arise like bees. The government should first have a method to stabilize the overall situation and a plan to resist the enemy. This is the proper way to prevent people from being shaken. If there is no plan to resist the enemy, and yet one wants to force the general public to remain calm, that is already difficult to do. Moreover, how can one blame others for not being calm when one cannot be calm oneself?</p>
<p>Therefore, some sarcastic people say that the authorities only value antiquities and do not value the people. Although this statement is too harsh, judging from the facts, the origin of this statement may not be without reason.</p>

<h3>Changes in Vegetables and Rice</h3>
<p>— Lin Xia</p>
<p>Calling for vegetables and eating rice, who wouldn't know how! One interruption leads to death. What exactly happens to the fragrant and fresh vegetables and rice that are eaten? What is excreted is yellow and smelly feces and urine. Perhaps many of the readers of this journal do not understand the changes in vegetables and rice that occur in their own bodies at all times!</p>
<p>The types of vegetables and rice we eat are extremely numerous. But in terms of the nutrients they contain, there are only three categories...</p>
<p>The first category... carbohydrates... are various foods containing starch and sugar, such as rice, wheat, and yams.</p>
<p>The second category... proteins... are foods such as egg white, tofu, and meat.</p>
<p>The third category... fats... are foods such as various oils and fats.</p>
<p>Although these three types of things are contained in various vegetables and rice to varying degrees, unless they are ground and dissolved in water, becoming a liquid that can penetrate the inner surface of blood vessels, they cannot be used by our bodies!</p>
<p>Therefore, vegetables and rice must undergo five changes...</p>
<p>First... they must be bitten and ground by the teeth;</p>
<p>Second... the saliva in the mouth must ferment the carbohydrates in the vegetables and rice, turning them into a permeable sugar solution;</p>
<p>Third... when swallowed, the gastric juice in the stomach turns the proteins in the vegetables and rice into a type of peptone;</p>
<p>Fourth... in the intestines, the bile secreted from the gallbladder first turns the fats and oils in the vegetables and rice into permeable emulsified fats.</p>
<p>Fifth... the pancreatic juice (also called pancreas, Shanghai people call it "jia gan") secreted from the pancreas further transforms the three nutrients in the vegetables and rice that have not been completely changed into sugar solution, peptone, and emulsified fat!</p>
<p>The transformed sugar solution, peptone, and emulsified fat then penetrate the mucous membranes of the mouth, stomach, and intestines, entering the blood vessels and circulating throughout the body. Further, two changes occur...</p>
<p>㈠ The oxygen inhaled in the lungs is attached to the blood cells and spread throughout the body.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>The oxygen reacts, producing heat and energy. The heat keeps our bodies warm! The energy allows our entire bodies to move.</p>
<p>㈡ In various parts of the body, it becomes new cells of muscle, skin, bone, blood, and brain, so our bodies can grow and maintain their original state.</p>
<p>When we are full, our bodies are warm! When we are sick and eat less, our entire bodies quickly become weak, this is the reason.</p>
<p>All of the above changes cannot be separated from water. Without water, no changes can occur. Therefore, everyone must drink a large amount of water every day. Being thirsty for a long time can also kill people.</p>
<p>Because the vegetables and rice we eat are not purely composed of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, the three nutrients that are not completely changed, and other impurities, accumulate in the large intestine. However, roundworms and other bacteria that are not very harmful to humans feel that they are the ultimate delicacy! Thus, they develop and grow in the human large intestine, fermenting and decomposing them, producing several malodorous gases such as ammonia and hydrogen sulfide. When released alone, they become farts; when discharged with feces, they create the characteristic odor of feces.</p>

<p>Communication from Shop Employees</p>
<h3>Dying for Face, Suffering While Alive</h3>
<p>Dear Editor... I am an only son, with no brothers or sisters, only one younger sister. When I was eighteen years old, my father abandoned his loving mother, wife, orphaned son, and weak daughter and passed away; at that time, I was still studying in the second year of old-style middle school. When my father was alive, he was also a small official, and his income was not bad. However, he was generous by nature, with a great sense of "never leaving a surplus." Therefore, the situation after his death was very bleak. In the year following my father's death, my grandmother, due to missing her beloved son, became ill with grief and anger, and also followed her beloved son to the underworld. In all the funeral matters, my mother refused to reduce them in the slightest because she wanted to maintain appearances. She arranged the expenses for the funeral on the one hand, and planned for the tuition fees for my sister and me on the other hand, and still had to maintain the seven daily necessities, making it extremely difficult. Seven years ago, I graduated from a certain middle school in this city and entered the State-run Gams Bureau as a mid-level employee. I had a monthly income of about one hundred yuan, and the position was very secure. Seeing that I could stand on my own feet in society, my mother handed over the entire family burden to me in the New Year of the following year. She handed me a stack of account books. After a detailed review, I learned that the debt was about more than one thousand eight hundred dollars. The reason for this was mostly because of maintaining face. Although I personally do not approve of this method, I also know that this is a common problem in society, so I am very understanding of my mother and only grateful to her for her hard work in supporting the family for many years, without any resentment. Then, the issue of my marriage was raised. According to my mother, she very much wanted to hold a grand wedding in our hometown. At that time, because the previous debts had not been cleared, I advocated that it had to be frugal. Fortunately, the parents of the other party were old friends and knew my situation, and forgave everything. It was held hastily in my place of work, costing less than seven hundred dollars. After that, I immediately began to be frugal and clear the debts; until recently, it finally came to an end. During these seven years, although everything was frugal, I was not stingy with my sister's tuition fees. I deeply know that this is the foundation of her future happiness. This summer, it is calculated that she can graduate from high school; her fiancé - the son of a wealthy family in our hometown - is also scheduled to marry this winter. So our problems started again! According to my mother, it is necessary to have a certain scale; so as to avoid my sister being bullied in the future, and at the same time not to lose our family's face. But this lightly "a certain scale" four words, it is calculated that it will not be done without two thousand dollars. When I thought about it myself, the past seven years have been busy with nothing but debts. Now, although the debts have been cleared, but the children are growing up, and the standard of living is getting higher and higher; if I rashly agree, these debts of more than two thousand yuan, I am afraid it will be enough for me to suffer for thirteen or fourteen years? How long is life, the time to make money, at most only twenty or thirty years. Thinking like this; I politely refused, advocating frugality, and all expenses should be limited to seven hundred dollars. Because this is the total amount of expenses for my wedding. I ask myself that I can always be worthy of others. Who knew that my old mother, on hearing this, became very angry. She said very sternly, "When your grandmother died, I was a widow, and your father had no savings, and I still arranged everything decently; our family's face has been maintained until now. Now you are a man with a job, and your income is above average, how can you bear to lose face?" I dared not answer at the time. But thinking about it now, it seems too bitter to borrow money to marry my sister, and it is not necessary in fact; because my future brother-in-law, he is very wealthy. Sacrificing my own happiness, only to get a smile from others, is also too foolish; but the mother's command is difficult to disobey, what to do? (To be continued) Xu Shugao respectfully submits</p>
<p>× × × ×</p>
<p>Editor's note... Chinese people are too focused on face and disregard the facts, so the contradictory life of "dying for face and suffering while alive" can be seen everywhere. From the above letter from Mr. Xu, we can also find two points that are not economically reasonable. ㈠ Mr. Xu's father's income was not bad; but the result was no savings. Although he was generous, this method of using it as soon as it was in hand is also inappropriate. As a result, his virtuous wife and beloved son suffered countless pain.</p>
<p>㈡ Mr. Xu's mother, in her mother-in-law's funeral, disregarded her strength and stubbornly fought for the occasion. Although she could "fully perform the duties of a son" and "fully perform filial piety" in the blessing meeting; this method of enduring pain and wanting to be good is ultimately inappropriate. So as a result, Mr. Xu suffered a long-term (seven years) of pain. Now she still wants her son to do this for the matter of marrying his sister, it can really be said to be stubbornly obsessed.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Xu's personal past does have three points that are worthy of our admiration.</p>
<p>㈠ After discovering that his mother, when she was in charge of the family, had built a debt platform of one thousand eight hundred dollars, he could forgive her difficulties; without any resentment. The way of a son, to this point can already be said to be blameless.</p>
<p>㈡ In the midst of extreme difficulty, he can continue to provide his sister's tuition fees, taking care of her lifelong happiness. The brother's obligation can also be considered fulfilled.</p>
<p>㈢ When he got married, he was able to break the environment and save as much as possible. Now, when marrying his sister, although it is very difficult, he is willing to take out the same amount of money that he spent when he got married to give to his sister. It can also be considered generous.</p>
<p>We advise Mr. Xu to resolutely follow his own ideas, this is not wrong. In front of the old mother, he should gently explain when she is happy. The heart of loving a child is shared by everyone, and understanding is not difficult to imagine.</p>
<p>If you make a cocoon for yourself, then the most precious middle age of life will be ruined; and maybe you will end up like your father, leaving endless pain to your wife and children!</p>
<p>We also advise Mr. Xu's mother to finally repent for her past mistakes, which have already made her son very embarrassed; do not continue to be stubborn, making it impossible for her son to ever succeed.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu's sister should also take into account her brother's difficulties and remember his seven years of educational grace. In front of her mother, try to persuade her. I think a woman who has received secondary education can certainly understand this; and this method is most likely to make her mother change her mind, because half of her reason for advocating extravagance is to maintain face, and half is still afraid that her daughter will be bullied in the future.</p>
<p>Finally, I must loudly appeal to Mr. Xu's brother-in-law and his parents, as well as the general public, to quickly change their views and implement the legacy of Mr. Zhu, "Marrying a wife requires seeking a virtuous woman, do not count on a rich dowry."</p>

<h3>A Scholarly Family (Continued 9)</h3>
<p>— Wang Zhongxian</p>
<p>(5) Sending Big Red Invitations for a Death</p>
<p>Mrs. Xia did not necessarily have to rely on her husband to send living expenses in order to make a living, but suddenly stopping the money that she had been accustomed to receiving every month, she always felt somewhat resentful. She wrote a letter to blame Zhongnan, who did not even reply with an empty letter of excuse, and this anger was truly extraordinary! Her old illness relapsed, the "qi" stuck in her chest, and it did not go down for several days. She invited Chinese and Western doctors everywhere, took medicine and had injections, all to no avail; all that was seen was her eyes rolled upwards, with more white than black. In the first two days of the onset, she could still yell in pain like a pig being slaughtered, but later she became too weak to cry out, her breathing was like that of an athlete in a twenty-five-mile race reaching the finish line, her throat and mouth were blocked by a pile of phlegm that was neither up nor down!</p>
<p>Seeing that the situation was not right, Ali ordered Lao Hu to send three or four urgent telegrams to Zhongnan's post, and the reply telegram said, "Mrs. has passed away, please Big Master Bodong preside over the funeral affairs, expenses to be frugal." The person was not even dead yet, and he had already begun to calculate for the dead! If this reply telegram were to be seen by Mrs., it would be like a death warrant urging her to return to heaven. Lao Hu and Ali discussed hiding it.</p>
<p>Mrs. Xia knew that her illness was incurable and difficult to recover, so she called Maosheng and Ali to her bedside and said in a barely audible voice...</p>
<p>"Maosheng, I have raised him with all my heart. After I die, I'm afraid he will suffer in that woman's hands. Although Ali is a servant girl, I have always treated you as a daughter. I will simply recognize you as a daughter now, then Maosheng will be your brother, and you must take care of him differently in the future, don't let that woman bully him, and I will secretly protect you! You have served me for a while, these few pieces of jewelry are considered your reward."</p>
<p>As she spoke, she randomly grabbed a few pieces of jewelry from a jewelry box beside her pillow and gave them to Ali, who took them with tears in her eyes and comforted Mrs. After a while, Mrs. also ordered Maosheng to change his address in the future, calling Ali "Sister" and calling Secretary Sang "Brother-in-law."</p>
<p>After another three or five days, Mrs. Xia actually passed away peacefully! Big Master Bodong and Fourth Master Jici came forward to handle the funeral affairs. Xia's family has many descendants, and there were quite a few people wearing mourning clothes to send off the funeral. Regarding the issue of Maosheng's qualification to hold the mourning tablet, some people in the clan had raised objections. Later, Bodong explained, "Zhongnan has not formally established an heir. Although Maosheng is not biological, the second room has not denied or expressed any opinion, so it is not convenient for others to make decisions for him." Therefore, Maosheng still performed as the protagonist in mourning clothes. Because this issue had not been resolved, no obituary was issued after Mrs. Xia's death.</p>
<p>When the news of the death reached Zhongnan's post, Xia Second Master widely sent big red wedding invitations, choosing an auspicious day to feast guests. Sending big red invitations for a death, there is no such reason! Someone opened his wedding invitation and suddenly realized that the invitation read...</p>
<p>Respectfully select a certain day of the month to hold a temple visit ceremony for Ms. Ai Ruohua.</p>
<p>Respectfully request the presence of the entire family Xia Zhongnan and daughter Daiqiu bowing</p>
<p>This is an invitation for a concubine to be promoted to the main wife, which is also said in a dignified manner, but Xia Nan is from Jiangnan, and there is no Xia family ancestral hall in the post where he is an official. This temple visit ceremony can only be performed by facing the palace and kowtowing remotely like the emperor's era. Under Xia Zhongnan's name is also dragging an oil bottle miss, this is hinting that Ms. Ai Ruohua is also a "second-married head miss." The drafter of this invitation can be considered to have put in a lot of effort!</p>
<p>Ms. Ai Ruohua's fate is really bad! She made a set of magnificent wedding dresses, preparing to make a big splash on the auspicious day, but unfortunately, the happy event had not yet arrived, and disaster flew in from the outside! It turned out that the political situation in the province had changed at that time, and the head of the province had received the news earlier and had slipped into the concession, issuing a telegram of resignation. Zhongnan managed the province's finances, and it was difficult to get away without going through the handover procedures. He heard that the superior had fled in a big way and also wanted to run away, but unfortunately he received the news too late, and someone was monitoring his actions. If he rashly left the province, he would inevitably make a fool of himself on the spot and be detained, which would be too embarrassing! (To be continued)</p>
