<h3 id="c40">財政急應節流 <a href="#c40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— 庚·</p>
<p>吾國處此内憂外患非常嚴重之時。政府所恃以渡難關者。財政實爲第一要圖。近數年來財政上早已入不敷出。九一八後。東北海關被奪。發公債。加租稅。人民又已筋疲力盡。何堪再受挖肉補瘡之苦。無已。於財政上合理的開源外。惟有實事求是。節流而已。</p>
<p>節流之道。千端萬緒。約言之。可得三端。</p>
<p>一、裁撤駢枝機關。自官僚主義深入人心。中央與地方。無論何種機關。類多非因事擇人而實因人增事者。駢拇枝指。所在多有。譬如各省競設專員公署。上奉省命。下督縣政。職權與前清府道相似。而與今日之民廳相抗衡。其非絶對必要可知。各署平均轄縣。多至五六。且有自兼一縣長與保安司令者。舉凡各縣施政得失。民問疾苦。地方治安等。咸萃一身。誰復有此神通。克勝多任。况一縣上有層峯。而爲此疊床架屋之舉。則法令之頒布。文書之傳達。恒因無謂之周折濡滯。而遺悮時機。誠能於全國機關嚴格裁撤。至少當可減去全數三分之一。在財政開支上。亦自可減少一部分之浪費。</p>
<p>二、汰減公務冗員。政府大小機關。必有鉅額冗員可裁。此於各該長官更換人員時所昭示即可知之。每當一機關長官履新時。初必曰絶不撤調一人。繼必減政裁人。終則添置私人。其裁也未見政務廢弛。其添也亦未大著辦事效率。由是故舊多居要津。戚友滿布當道。甚且一人包攬多職。空銜遙領。坐糜鉅薪。在政治機關服官多年之人員。往往受厚俸而無一技之長。終身浸入政界。而爲永久之寄生蟲。他如所謂秘密費活動費等。任意浮報。概須與冗員一併嚴格掃除。政費當可減輕不少。冗員裁汰之後。職務如果繁重。亦當愼重用人。不可妄增。蓋當國難嚴重時期。一人兼理二事。亦屬義不容辭。且公務員對國家。應有之報効精神也。</p>
<p>三、愛惜物力。官場積習。大都狗馬聲色。縱慾無度。機關公用物品。尤不愛惜。例如互書姓名。或隨錄片言。即隨手掣用信箋一張。公家之紙張筆墨。私人全家應用。此殆經見無怪之事。此雖甚爲微細。但千百機關。人人如此。累月積年。濫費紙張之數。即可汗牛充棟。又如各署公報。每多印刷精良。所印長官職員等照像。紙色尤須精美。奢費不計。且有官吏於一切建設未加注意。而先於公署大興土木。設備堂皇。以示期闊綽者。殊不知一絲一縷之浪費。何莫非小民膏血。不惜國帑虚耗。不念物力維艱。爲害誠非淺鮮。蓋吾人以爲凡爲國家謀工業上建設及文化上有關精神實際之事業。固宜不惜窮盡人力物力。以冀其儘量發展。至若公文書報一閱即棄之類。或爲個人及機關用人居處休暇之所。則皆不妨因陋就簡。以稍紓財力也。</p>
<p>綜觀上列諸事。除愛惜物力。尚鮮明文提倡外。餘如裁撤駢枝機關。汰減公務冗員。中央曾多次决議厲行緊縮政策。然在實際上似尚未能實行。或且有變本加厲者。倘長此以往。不謀所以實行緊縮。力倡節省主義。則財政前途之危機。誠非逆料所能及也。</p>

<p>西青籃球昨晚僅甲組兩場、海賊勝持志、局勢成一面倒、結果八十三比三十六、江灣勝約翰、四十一比三十二局勢極見緊凑、</p>
<p>海賊勝持志　海賊初因軍容不振、陣綫散漫、故與持志交綏之下、反處下風、持志因射籃不準、凡九投而二中、於是相持六分鐘後、海賊賴史密斯之短擲、遂居優越地位、至斯海賊鋒芒漸露、而前鋒亦皆心平氣和、幾有擲必中、上半時完了三十七比十二、海賊勝、下午時持志仍一籌莫展、復因身材矮小、傳遞與截球無不爲他人佔先、雙方實力旣如是之懸殊、戰勢故極平穩無浪、總結果八十三比三十六、</p>

<p>江灣勝約翰　江灣與約翰接觸之初、雙方似皆未悉軍情、戰來不免有紊亂之處、江灣初因軍心燥急、後衛連告犯規、前鋒攻而不克、故約翰首先居上風、五分鐘激戰旣下、江灣合作美妙、因此超越而上、約翰沉着應戰、節節進迫、果然打成十七比十七平局、至斯江灣重振旗鼓、連罰帶擲、卒以二十二比十七小勝上半時、下半時内、局勢更形緊張、江灣一鼓作氣、連中三元、約翰遙遙落後、急調軍馬補先、奈實力有限、轉雖反敗爲勝、總結果江灣仍以十四一比三二勝、江　灣　犯　分　約　翰　犯　分</p>

<h3 id="c252">大夫與郎中 <a href="#c252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>北方人稱醫生爲大夫，大約是戤太醫院的牌頭，那些院外人以此自榮，病家希望醫生盡些心力，也就把　尊稱恭維上去，久而久之，就成了專利的稱呼。和南方人稱醫生爲郎中，是差不多的道理。</p>
<p>我覺得稱呼最不容易改變，並且决不是等因奉此一道命令可以奏效的。記着辛亥革命成功，孫中山先生在綂綂府，分付一律稱先生，把大人老爺廊面清之。但是曾幾何時，還是給大人老爺復活了。國民革命北伐成功，又是一律稱同志，可是這同志只能在同一機關中十足通用，到了别的機關裏，就有不兌現的可慮。至於民間，更是絲毫「人維求舊一，一切還和愛新覺羅治下一般光景。</p>
<p>不過南方人的嘴上說郎中，紙上還是寫醫生，不像北方人言文一致，報紙上的廣告也稱大夫。我們南方人見了，容易聯想到訃聞上的朝議奉直下面連綴的大夫，似乎有「至今猶見舊官儀」之慨。並且這個大字，要讀如代字，又容易聯想到說書先生嘴上的大王，似乎有一點粗家之氣。不過三國志上的魯大夫，一受嚇於草船備箭時之諸葛亮，再受嚇於單刀赴會時的關羽，這個太夫就不好做啦。</p>
<p>唯物派說起來，大夫也好，郎中也好，只求藥到病除。所以我瞧見北平某大學的校刊，還是寫着請某大夫爲校醫，大夫和校醫兩個名詞連在一起，非常感到歷史的趣味。</p>
<h3 id="c253">好轉 <a href="#c253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— 錢醉竹</p>
<p>這丨丨好轉丨丨當然是吉羊文字。大病初回危象轉佳，不致作陳死人。此是好轉之一。</p>
<p>友誼日惡，勢蔣割席。經人斡旋，猜嫌漸釋，此是好轉之二。</p>
<p>敗子回頭，讀書修德。家業中落，發奮圖强。振衰起疲，漸即佳境，此是好轉之三。</p>
<p>像上舉的例，無論那一方面，祇要在「一記巴掌一塊糖」的原則下去尋，是多得很的。</p>
<p>大國風度，而又是先聖先賢敎化下的中國，講究一個「不念舊惡。」所以吃了别人「辣辣一巴掌，」祗要挨得過這片刻疼痛，便不與計較；所謂「大人不記小人之過。」至於矮人，短人，蠻夷戎狄之輩，更是不屑敎誨，犯不着失落了「君子之風。」不要說小孩子無知妄作，恃愛犯上，不便計較；就算有心干犯，也惟有秉着悲憫之旨，憐其無識，自陷罪罟。所以「左耳光刮過，右耳光送上，」才不愧其爲大聖人。婁師德的「唾面自乾」差遠哩。</p>
<p>人能這樣一想，不但耳光不痛，而且能十足的造成我做成「聖賢之徒」，頓覺臉上增光，還要深深感謝對方一巴掌成全之德哩。痛得足云，恨，更没有的事　　要知道别國人民的文明程度，究竟差些。直僵僵地「好便好，不好便拉倒」，决不能像中國人有「好惡由人宛轉隨意」的功夫。惟其如此，所以在别國見不到的「好轉」，在中國便特别多。這要算中國足以自豪的吧？</p>
<h3 id="c254">說夢話 <a href="#c254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— 愼言</p>
<p>有一次，我做了一個夢，夢見我的好友Ｃ君忽因戀愛事件投浦自殺，幸有某國水手在旁，始得把他從江心救起。這個夢原是很平常的，但是那個時候，Ｃ君正因某種原因，和他的戀人發生齟齬，情形很有使我這夢境變爲實事的可能，打定在第二天上，我就特地趕到他辦公的所在去找他，把昨晚那個夢語給他聽，不但講得很詳盡，而且還屢用警告的語調撥刺他，意思大有勸他從速向對方的那位女士叩頭請降之意。後來他是否實行，我雖不敢妄斷，不過Ｃ君却至今健在，並未眞跳黄浦，而他的戀愛事業，也依舊不斷的進行。祗是當我每次見到他的時候，總免不掉要向他說一句「當心跳黄浦」，而他的答復也總是「别說夢話」丨</p>
<p>不幸有一天，他把他的那句「别說夢話的例話說得太高了些，因此使我很感難受，我們兩個人便從嘻笑入手，閙到了正式辯論的地步。可是全虧這麽一番辯論，倒使我無中生有的發生了一重新的覺悟，並利用了這一重新覺悟，駁得Ｃ君啞口無言，從此我雖不時的還向他說趣；「當心跳黄浦」丨他却不再把「别打夢話」四個字來做答詞了。</p>
<p>我說：「朋友，你不要以爲夢跟事實眞有什麽天大的分别，你也不要把夢看得太輕了，我祗要同你兩點：譬如說發財是一件不容易的事情，雖然你志心朝禮的節流開源，甚至不惜變盡了種種方法想去弄錢，但是事實告訴我們，十個想發財的人，結果往往一齊失敗。不錯，在事實上要發財，確不是一件容易的事情。然而你要如存心想在今天晚上做一個發財的夢，你能保證今晚凖能做這個夢嗎？當然是不能的丨那末做夢之難也眞不下於事實咧丨第二我再問你昨天你做了些什麽事情，假說你昨天曾和某女士接過一次吻，但是你今天還能保留這一吻嗎丨還能用什麽左證使人家確信你昨天曾和伊接過吻呢？還不是跟做夢一般的祗在你自已的腦神筋上留下一些可以追憶的印象而已。人家也儘可譏笑你是要說夢話，你又怎樣能保證你自已昨天這一吻到將來必能産生何種結果呢？所以，昨天的事實，到今天就等於夢一樣，前一分鐘或一秒鐘發生的事實，過後也就等於夢，那末追述過去的事實或追述做過的夢，中間又有什麽分别呢？」</p>

<p>伊解開了自已的衣襟，把乳頭送進了小主人的嘴裏，兩指放在豐渍的乳房上輕輕地一揑，只聽得那小嘴就「嘓都嘓都」地吸吮着伊的乳水。</p>
<p>伊胸中飽貯着莫名的悲哀，一聲不響，只是視線呆呆地注意着地板的一角。　　「我的奶，不能喂哺我自已的孩子：　　：去供人家吸吮：：：抛棄了：：：自已　　的骨肉：：：去撫養别人的孩子：：：伊　　們生了孩子：：：要别人來喂奶：：：我　　很想喂自已的孩子：：：不能：：：遠離　　了可愛的鄉井：：：來這裏看可怕的陌　　生面孔：：：」</p>
<p>伊儘這樣往下想着，一陣過路秋風，彷彿從遠處傳來一絲絲孩子的啼聲，「呀：我的心肝丨你現在怎麽樣了？」伊禁不住這種凄凉印象的包圍，慘然地落下兩顆淚珠。</p>
<p>少奶奶從伊身旁走過，發現了伊的淚痕，回到房裏，看見「老黄媽」，隨便問了一句：「奶媽爲什麽哭？」黄媽說：「新奶媽總是這樣，我從前初出來帮人家也還不是這樣丨大概都是初出茅廬世故太淺的原故丨」</p>
<p>果然，一年以後，伊漸漸地知道這是很自然的一會事，並且又漸漸地知道了「人」的中間，還有「命」的不同，於是伊就很滿足的度着奶媽生活。</p>

<p>第二十回　卜吉有期老人連日笑　剷愁不盡舊雨對門居</p>
<p>江氏道；你要問，又不讓我說，我不說了，我還要出門去一趟呢。他說時，就把坑上堆疊着的一個木箱子，端了下來，在箱子裏檢齊七八件衣服料子，放到坑上，將一個舊包袱包了，然後把箱子搬還原處。等他爬下坑來的時候，却見桂枝提着包袱，手反背着。放到身後去，却笑問道：這把這些衣料子打算拿到那裏去？江氏道：我也該拿給人家去做呀。桂枝道：你糊裏糊塗，就交給裁縫做去，做得不合式，糟了料子還不要緊，我要是不願意的話，你又該說我囉唆了。江氏道：我怕你自已不管呢。你願意管，那就好極了，免得我提心吊胆，不合你的意。桂枝道：我這可不懂了，自已做衣服，爲什麽不管呢？母親怕他不管的這個緣由，他實在是懂的，故意的這樣說着，表示心裏很坦然的樣子，於是把那包袱打開，只抽出一件衣料，用大手絹包着，自言自語的道：我也正等着要衣服穿，先拿一件糙料子，讓王裁縫去做着試試罷。江氏也是做姑娘出身的，知道姑娘們對於嫁時衣，總免不了那一種要問不問的樣子，做母親的只有含糊着做一個顧問，否則姑娘會惱羞成怒的。因爲如此，所以江氏坐在一邊，只當無事。桂枝似乎也覺得此事有些尶　，在屋子裏呆站了一陣，又清理清理桌上的東西，看看母親並没有什麽言語，這才提了那個手絹包，從從容容的走出大門去了。到了大門口，就向大街兩頭望了一望。這才順了人家墻根低了頭一步一步的走着。走了大半截胡前，忽聽得身後有人呌道：大姑娘好久不見啦，這幾天又到城裏玩兒去了嗎。（二七二）</p>

<p>雪花膏的製法　冬令最流行的要算雪花膏了，並且銷數也很大，祇要到料器店去買些瓶，印刷局去印些招貼，製法是很簡便的，或做些散倉雪花，放在各烟紙店寄銷，或批給理髮店，得到的餘利，對於家庭的經濟不無小補。它的原料配合法：</p>
<p>司的林（須買上等的，次貨有牛油氣味。）八兩。</p>
<p>炭酸納，八錢。</p>
<p>沙濾水，二十五兩。</p>
<p>甘油，六兩。</p>
<p>香料，八錢或一兩。（玫瑰精，茉莉香精，白蘭花香精都可。）</p>
<p>以上上海工業原料行，或各藥房都有售。它的製法，先把炭酸納放入沙濾水中，拿棒把它攪溶，另用琺瑯鍋，把司的林打碎，放入鍋中　置微火上加熱，火不可過大，最好備華氏表一攪，把有水銀一端插入試騐，大約一百六七十度最適宜。等它完全溶化後，把炭酸納水，分六七次倒入，（溶炭納的水約二十五兩。）每次倒入，就會發生鹼化作用，起初因爲受冷而分散，又復受熱而鹼化，直到鹼液加完，（就是炭酸納水。）這時全體早由薄漿變做糊狀了。這時攪拌須不停手，優水蒸汽略爲蒸發後，再加入甘油，仍續攪拌，等熱氣稍去加入香精，　時金體受冷，就由薄體變成厚結了。那時雪花已成，就分裝入瓶，放置三四日後，自會透發光彩，香氣馥郁。我每年冬季，總得做上幾次，以備主顧另買。照上述的做法，雪花膏一定很好的。</p>
<p>蜜膏製法　蜜膏在冬天是平民的恩物，擦了可免皮膚的爆裂，且資本不大，做法又易，像蛤殼蜜膏和鐵盒蜜膏銷路都很大。它的原料是用：</p>
<p>白凡士林，一兩。</p>
<p>滑石粉，六錢。</p>
<p>燭紅粉，適量。（顏料店有售。）</p>
<p>玫瑰油，適量。</p>
<p>把凡士林微火加熱，等它溶化，加入滑示粉，拌匀，取燭紅粉調入成妃色，或不用燭紅粉，全白的也可，離火，把玫瑰油拌入，乘它流動的時候，裝入盒中，等到冷時就會凝成很好的蜜膏了。</p>

<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>古城會是一位黑面的和一位紅面閙氣（恕外行的人說外行話）的爛熟舊戲；我前幾天在仙霞社重看此戲，忽想起某先生恢復舊道德的演說，覺得這以千萬人演述千萬人表演的定型道德，應在恢復之首。</p>
<p>那位黑面的三弟，對於紅面的二哥，自來只有佩服，服從；那一回，却大大地懷疑起來，簡直否定了那紅面的人格。好像已經賣了身的妓女，在龜手裏呌賣的貞節，也就不值半文錢了。在黑面看來，丞相那邊的高官厚禄，早就把紅面的迷住了靈魂；而桃園中信誓旦旦的結義，早被紅面的丢在腦後；豈有得了丞相的寵愛，還肯千里歸劉之理？所以閉門不納，正在情理之中。</p>
<p>在我們後人看來，紅面的固然可以佩服，心底裏却未始不笑他太傻。他若向丞相低頭屈膝，子女玉帛，從心所願，多麽幸樂；歸到劉備這邊來，風霜雨雪，流離顚沛，多麽困楚：辭「幸樂」而就「困楚」，至少今世士大夫决不肯這樣做的。中國下層社會的各式結社，他們所敬仰的就是這位不肯服事丞相的紅面好漢；而我們要找有操守的人物，亦當於下層社會求之。古人謂信義行於「君子」，「君子」二字，大可斟酌一下。</p>
<p>桃花扇偵戲一幕，說阮大鉞呌家童到鷄鳴埭探聽復社公子看了燕子箋的批評；聽他們說「眞才子，筆不凡，論文采，天仙吏，謫人間。」心花爲之一開。聽他們說「爲何投崔魏，自摧殘」，只好皺眉自嘆：「只有這點點不才，如今也不必說了丨」「如今也不必說了」，只有士大夫才說得出口；若紅面的也說這樣的話，黑面的便不賣他的賬了。</p>
<p>時至今日，我也頗想提倡提倡舊道德，即如古城會式的古老道德；可是誰配提倡這古老的道德，到值得斟酌一下；别的不怕，只怕黑面的閉門固拒，否定了紅面的人格呢丨</p>
<h3 id="c285">翻譯名著的條件 <a href="#c285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— 侃然</p>
<p>當一般青年都感着無書可讀，缺少精神糧食的時候，當幾個較大的書局都埋頭於敎科書市場的競爭，不願印行譯稿的時候，中山文化敎育館忽有系綂的翻譯西洋名著的擬議，這自然是使人非常高興的事。</p>
<p>本來，系綂的介紹西洋名著非有巨大的資本不行，中山文敎館得着政府和私人帮助，經費充足，出來舉辦這種文化上的大事業，實在是再適當没有。聽說該館預定給翻譯者每千字稿費五元外，將來出書時，還可抽取牌稅。以這樣的條件，我想是應當得着好的番譯成績的。　　不過，系綂的介紹世界名爭，究竟不是容易的事，雖有雄厚的財力，也還要辦理得法才行。倘若辦得好，對於我國文化將有極大極佳的影響；不然，則不惟枉費了金錢，且將使現今蕪雜的翻譯界益爲世人所垢病。所以站在純學術的立場上，我忍不住要貢獻一點意見：</p>
<p>一所收名著要經過精密的選擇。丨西洋名著，浩如烟海，我們限於人力與財力，權衡輕重，自非經過一番精密的選擇不可，我以爲：</p>
<p>（一）旣是系綂的介紹，那便要選歷史上已有定評的名著，時人的著作宜少選。</p>
<p>（二）要從歐洲文化湛深的國家去搜求，像日本美國那樣新興的國家，旣没有幾個上得檯盤的世界學者，他們的著作宜少選或竟不選。</p>
<p>（三）重要的著作，卽使已經有人譯過，但若那譯本不甚妥善時，應予重譯。</p>
<p>（四）確有價值的名著，雖明知翻譯出來，少有人看，也應當翻譯。</p>
<p>總之，名著的取捨，非網羅許多對於西洋文化有着深切了解的專門學者來從長商議不行。該館現在已决定翻譯一些什麽名著，所决定翻譯的名著究竟是由那幾位學者選出，我們不得而知，但審定委員的名單，我們却早在報上看到了。遺憾的是：那些委員雖多係狠有名望的人物，但極少對於西洋文化有着深切了解的學者，其中甚至有任何外國文都不懂的人，這上面，我覺得主持者還有加以增補和淘汰的必要。</p>
<p>二，名著的翻譯要力求完善。丨丨翻譯名著是應當非常鄭重的事，該館旣有着雄厚的財力，倘仍不能得到完善的譯文，則不惟遺誤讀者，而且也對不起那些苦心著述的泰西的賢哲。爲求譯文完善起見，我以爲：</p>
<p>一要延聘中西一貫的專門家担任翻譯。丨丨翻譯名著不單要選富有翻譯經騐的，中西文字俱佳的人担任，並且還要那人對於所担任的名著有過專門研究才行。呌學工的人翻譯經濟史固不可，呌祇會翻譯小說的人翻譯AugComte的Cours　de　Philosophie　Positive那樣艱深的哲學著作，也就滑稽。</p>
<p>二名著務必從原文翻譯。丨丨我們知道無論怎樣好的譯文，和原著比較起來，總是要大大的打上一個折扣的，尤其是哲學方面的著作，眞是差之毫厘，失之千里。我國以前翻譯人才缺乏，德法諸國的著作，多從英文或日文間接譯出，不免有許多跟着初譯者錯誤的地方。現在精通德法文者甚多，如果再要採用間接翻譯的辦法，那實在是没有理由的事。</p>
<p>其餘私見尚多，限於篇幅，不克盡陳。最要的是：我希望該館這次翻譯世界名著要抱着爲文化服務，爲學術犧牲的决心，不可有絲毫營利或其他的企圖。印刷發行儘可委託書店，但名著的選擇，却絶不可被書店左右，免得有貪圖銷路，迎合市面，捨眞正有價值的名著不取，而以西洋三四流的作品或日本美國新近出版的一些朝生暮死的著書來投機取巧的危險。我再說一句：該館這次翻譯世界名著的成功或失敗，關係中國文化前途極鉅，不單是主持者要鄭重其事，而全國著作界和讀書界也該予以深切的注意丨</p>

<p>— 陳梁</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>納蘭成德的詩論的唯一的特點，是反模仿主義。他和許多詩人一樣，主張創造，主張什麽時代應有適應於那時代的詩。在隨筆裏，他用了絶大的力量，反對摩擬的傾向，從理論上，從音韻上，給予種種的證明。在總的方面，他說：　　詩之學古，如孩提不能無乳姆也。　　必自立而後成詩，猶之能自立而後　　成人也。明之學老杜，學盛唐者，　　皆一生在乳姆胸前過日。</p>
<p>道「乳姆胸前過日」的喻言，可謂適當之至。在另一則裏，他提出疑問，「律詩，近體也，其開承轉合，與時文相似，唯無破承起講耳。古詩（此處疑有脫落，或係衍文）則歐蘇之文，千變萬化者也。作時文者多不敢擅作古文，而作律詩者無不竟作古詩，可乎哉？」可見，，這些模仿主義者，就是在他們本身，也極顯其矛盾，而没有綂一的理解。在音韻上，納蘭成德說：</p>
<p>今詩之大爲詩害者，莫過於作步韻詩，唐人中晚稍有之，宋乃大盛，故元人作「韻府羣玉」。今世非步韻無詩，豈非怪事丨詩旣不敵前人，而又自縛手臂以臨敵，失計極矣丨愚曾與友人言此，渠曰，今人止是做韻，誰曾做詩？此言利害，不可不畏；若人不戒絶此病，必無好詩同時，在另一條裏，也說「人之作詩，必宗乎三百篇，而用韻反不宗之，豈非顚倒」。這和總的方面一樣，指出模仿主義的没有出路，是一種「尋死主義」，以及在這音韻的模擬上，同樣的顯示了它的矛盾性，而主張擊破這種主張。　　三</p>
<p>反對模仿主義，那麽，納蘭成德對於詩詞，是有着怎樣的積極的主張呢？他的主張，根據「渌水亭雜識」看去，可以說是有兩個標的，一是「言情」，二是「寄託」。在「言情」方面，納蘭成德說：　　曲起而詞廢，詞起而詩廢，唐體起　　而古詩廢。作詩欲以言情耳。生乎　　今之世，近體足以言情矣。好古之　　士，本無其情，而强效其體，以作　　古樂府，殊覺無謂。</p>
<p>這話和他所說的「詩乃心聲，性情中事也」，意思是一樣的。和後來俞曲園所說「詩能入人心脾便是佳作」，在理解上，也是一樣的。他的意思，詩不應該是模仿的，而應絶對的自由抒寫自已的心情。所以說：</p>
<p>人情好新，今日忽尚宋詩，學業欲　　干禄，人操其柄，不得不隨人轉步　　。詩取自適，何以隨人？</p>
<p>「詩取自適，何以隨人」，這見解可謂闢透得很。所謂「寄託」，當然是「有内容」的意思，有一定的主題的意思。把二者連繫起來，納蘭成德的主張就是，詩要有充實的新的内容，要有豐富的眞摯的情緒。他說：</p>
<p>唐人詩意，不在題中，亦有不在詩　　中者，故高遠有味；雖作詠物詩，　　亦必意有寄託，不作死句。今人論　　詩，唯恐一字走却題目，好文也，　　非詩也。</p>
<p>這正和他所說的「唐人有寄託，故使事靈；後人無寄託，故使事版」一樣，主張詩要有内容，要有寄託。這在隨筆裏，他不僅原則的指出，也引了杜甫，曹唐，韓偓，劉禹錫，武元衡諸人的詩作證。</p>

<p>她曾以整個母親的愛來裝飾這間臥室。壁上糊着洛安出産的那種模擬洛曼底古代織物的麻紗。一張路易十五時代的　，一把彫着　花，把手上一邊有一隻鴿嘴的靠椅，使四壁和滿房傢具都洋溢着一種可愛的鄉村風味。</p>
<p>「啊丨這漂亮極了，」陸太太說，她走進這間房子時，現着稍爲嚴肅的樣子。</p>
<p>「你喜歡這間房子嗎？」哲安問她。</p>
<p>「喜歡極了。」</p>
<p>「你知道我聽着這話是多麽高興啊。」</p>
<p>他們脈脈含情的彼此凝視了一下。</p>
<p>可是她在這間將來要成爲她的新婚房間的臥室裏，稍稍感著不自然，感着一點兒惶惑。她進來的時候便注意到那臥床是極大的，確是一張夫婦同睡的床，這牀是羅蘭夫人選定的，她一定預料到並且期望着她的兒子不久就要實現的結婚；但這種做母親的周到處頗使她高興，因爲這無異對她說這份人家在等着她。</p>
<p>隨後當大家回到客廳裏的時候，哲安突然把左邊的門開了，於是大家看到那開着三個窗户的，裝着一些日本籠燈的圓形飯廳。母子兩人曾用着所有的匠心巧思來佈置這間房子。這間有着竹製傢具，瓷人，五彩陶器，錦緞，綴有雨滴似的玻璃珠的透明的簾子，釘在壁上以便吸住壁布的扇子等等的房間，再加上那些屏風，大刀，假面具，眞的羽毛做成的鶴，和一切瓷的，木的，紙的，象牙的，螺鈿的，青銅的小玩意，使得這間房子現出一種由欠缺敏感，趣味或藝術敎育者的笨手盲目所弄出來的矯飾和裝作的模樣。可是這却是衆人最讚美的一間房子。筆爾以一種稍稍含着苦味的譏嘲說了幾句不很恭維的話，他的弟弟登時便覺不快。</p>
<p>桌上生果擺得像金字塔似的，點心也堆得很高。</p>
<p>可是大家一點也不餓；都祇咂吸了一點生果，嘗了一嘗點心。隨後，差不多經過一點鐘的時間，陸太太便起身告辭。</p>
<p>羅蘭老爹决定把她送到她家的門口，並且立刻和她動身，至於羅蘭夫人，則因女僕不在，還要在這屋裏巡看一遍，免得她的兒子缺少什麽。</p>
<p>「我得轉來接你嗎？」羅蘭老爹問。</p>
<p>她猶疑了一下，隨後回答道：</p>
<p>「不用，你回去睡罷。筆爾會領我回去的。」</p>
<p>等他走了，她便把燭吹熄，把點心，糖，各種里古耳酒收在櫃裏鎖好，把鑰匙交把哲安；隨後她便走進臥房；把被窩揭開，看飲水瓶裏是不是滿滿的盛着凍水，窗户有没有關好。</p>
<p>筆爾和哲安留在小客廳裏，哲安還因爲他的哥哥批評了他的趣味覺得不快，而筆爾則因爲看見他的弟弟住在這房子裏，漸漸的更爲憤怒。</p>
<p>他們兩人都坐着抽烟，没有說話。筆爾突然站起身說：</p>
<p>「這寡婦今晚臉色很疲倦啦，遠足旅行並没有使她變得好看呢。」</p>
<p>哲安忽然感着一種傷了心的柔懦者的突如其來的暴怒。</p>
<p>他憤激得氣都吐不出來，他吃吃的說：</p>
<p>「你以後再說到陸太太時，我不准你呌她「寡婦」？」</p>
<p>筆爾轉身向他，傲慢地說：</p>
<p>「你好像在對我下命令似的。你瘋了嗎？」</p>

<h3 id="c288">科學的發明和控制 <a href="#c288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>— 立齋</p>
<p>一提到科學，我們就不禁聯想到近世於人類生活最有貢獻的兩大人物：一個是發明電燈電話和留聲機，被世人譽爲「世界神秘之征服者」，兩年前去世的愛迪生，還有一個就是發明無線電，新近到過上海的馬可尼。</p>
<p>本來，人類的歷史，就是一部兩足動物憑了理智和技術以征服自然的奮鬥史。任何方面的大科學家，大發明家，都是首先用卓越的天才，苦心的焦思和艱難的試騐來指引人類去征服自然的偉大導師，因而獲得世人之普遍的崇拜。愛迪生逝世之所以普天同悼，馬可尼來華之所以受到狂熱而誠摯的歡迎，都是因此。</p>
<p>現代科學的昌明已經達到了聲光化電，指揮自如的階段，但是在茫茫無盡的大宇宙之中，我們人類去完全征服自然，支配自然的終極，還不知有多遠。因此，爲了人類之更豐富的生活和更大的幸福計，我們還需要許多未來的科學家和發明者來創造今後人類歷史之更偉大煇煌的篇幅。然而熟悉了人類的弱點和罪惡的我們，必須在這裏用特大的字樣補充一句，就是：我們固然需要更多的科學家和無數未來的科學發明，但同時尤其需要把整個科學的控制權，由少數帝國主義者，富豪巨閥們的手中，轉移到人類的多數丨這一義正辭嚴的斷語，可以從下列幾點來解釋：</p>
<p>第一，在歐戰之旣往的痛史和目前二次世界戰爭之發狂的凖備中，一切帝國主義者都拚命把科學集中應用到人類大屠殺的一途：結果，使本來是以增加人類幸福爲目的之科學，完全成爲少數野心家虐殺人羣的可怕的武器。例如：細菌發明的日新月異，本來是醫藥兩界之最大的進步，然而到了帝國主義手裏，各種最足以戕賊生命的細菌，都成了變相的砲彈。此外，如利用無線電來刺探别國軍事政治的秘密，以便凖備戰爭，利用電氣來虐殺政治犯，利用化學來製造毒瓦斯等，都是由少數野心家由控制政治兼而控制科學之所致。所以，要使科學成爲人類的科學，而不是「殺人的武器」，必須把對於科學的控制權，由國際的少數人手裏，奪歸人類的多數丨</p>
<p>第二，惟其是因爲帝國主義在歐戰中曾利用科學屠殺了八百多萬的戰士，製造了幾千萬的寡婦孤兒，毁滅了無數萬的人民財富，於是許多「玄學鬼」和唯心論者，就在戰後乘戰勝大放厥詞，說「科學造成歐戰罪惡」，主張今後的人類應該「少談科學」而多注重「精神生活」這種說敎，一方面是爲控制科學的少數人開脫大戰責任，一方面也是加科學和科學家以「張冠李戴」的誣蔑。所以，眞正要造福人類，具備政治頭腦的科學家，是絶不會願意他們絞盡腦汁，費盡心血所發明之科學的貢獻，完全長此被少數人所控制利用，作爲製造人類慘劇或罪惡之武器的。因爲少數人從科學家的研究室裏把人類「幸福的鎖匙」刦去當「罪惡的武器」，正是每一個科學家所切齒痛心的事。</p>
<p>第三，就咱們中國而言，豪紳腹賈，老爺太太們，更有一大半不懂得正確</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>的利用科學，人家利用無線電來收播高尚的音樂，發送重要的新聞，傳達學術思想的講演，而中國的太太紳士們，却裝了播音機來「還願」丨播送金剛經或多心經，或裝了無線收音機來「欣賞」「哭妙　篤爺」丨所以，控制如非其人，科學上的東西到了中國，也不見得與老百姓有多大益處丨</p>
<p>最後，謹致允分的敬意於新近訪問中國的無線電發明家馬可尼先生，同時爲了誠意尊重科學起見，並致「時日曷喪」的咀咒於把持科學，以之造孽的少數份子丨</p>

<p>— 之</p>
<p>前天，上海各報載着一個刊了花邊的廣州路透電：「滬戰中失去一足之兵一人，向某鞋店購鞋一隻，店主不允，致遭毆擊，遂扭送法院，經判决：購鞋須成雙，若購鞋一隻，店主在理宜加拒絶。」</p>
<p>内戰二十多年的中國軍人中，跛足斷臂的傷兵，當然是多得不可記數，各地傷兵滋事，亦成了普遍的無法可制的現象。唯其是多到不可記數，唯其是普遍無法可制，人們就大概都習以爲常而没有認眞地注意這事了。路透電中的跛足　士，曾是上海大打日本「皇軍」的「抗日英雄」，論起功勞，當也不在「蔡廷鍇」們之下，國家　國人對於這一位打「民族戰」的傷殘的弟兄，自應另眼相看，對於他的生活，應給予相當的方便與優待。但是不幸，國家太亂了，没有人注意到傷兵身上的事，這一來，這個獨脚的殘廢軍人向鞋店購買一隻鞋子的幽默消息，便由「路透」的電報而全國通曉了。</p>
<p>這是一件小事，大概有閒的人們也不會把這新聞當作一種怎樣幽默發鬆的資料，像那男女爭風吃醋的艷事一樣斤斤有味地談笑吧，因爲這事情在那些人們的眼中是莫大的荒唐丨一雙雙攤着賣的鞋子，可以折開來一隻一隻的買嗎？在這樣的社會裏　法官的判决，那眞是公正明快之至丨</p>
<p>然而、「公正明快之至」、就這樣輕鬆地掩蓋了這個簡單，平常，而實際是非常複雜和嚴重的社會問題丨</p>
<p>中國年年内戰，中國的軍隊年年增加，鄉村人烟稀少，田園盡都荒蕪，壯丁少男，都遭受生活的煎迫，跑到内戰的火線上了。戰爭是多麽殘酷呵，人民的生計，更把這無數的飢餓的一羣，驅逐在砲火之下，無情的摧殘丨丨死亡傷害丨</p>
<p>中國的軍隊，比世界任何一個國家多，中國兵士的生活，却比世界任何一個國家的兵士苦，别國的軍隊，不打内戰，别國的軍隊有優裕的生活，有共同发娱樂，有完善的訓練，有兵房駐紥；中國的軍隊拖着槍桿兒就要上火綫拼命，薪餉没有，娱樂没有，訓練没有，兵房没有，什麽都没有，但拖着槍桿兒就得拼命丨</p>
<p>今日國人的心理，大家都看見兵士，就恐懼，就生厭惡之感，這原因是中國的兵士一看見百姓就要打主意，餓着肚皮要向民間搶飯吃，没有娱樂，要找村婦尋歡，露宿荒野，要强佔民房駐紥，凡此種種，都是中國兵士不得已的苦楚，亦是老百姓的禍殃，我們看着這些苦楚和禍殃能夠責備誰呢？天理，良心，應該在那一面發現呢？</p>
<p>鼓惑滿洲自治中央中止</p>
<p>中内戰的戰場上，慘遭傷害的士兵，論功勞，於國於民何有丨但歷來的傷兵自恃勞苦功高驕横不可一世，他們不是對軍事長官驕横，而祇是對老百姓發洩他們抑鬱於心的悶氣，老百姓便横遭禍殃，這又能責備誰呢？若問他爲了誰而受傷，他就聲勢汹汹，但他並不知道爲了誰，爲了甚麽而受傷。</p>
<p>路透電中的獨脚軍人的脚，據說是在上海打「民族戰」而失去的，他這一隻脚倒是爲了國家民族的榮譽，國人似應不生厭惡之感吧丨但「獨脚只需獨鞋」，「購鞋須成雙」，這個利害的衝突，又能說誰是誰非呢？</p>
<p>只有法官是公正明快的：「講鞋須成雙，若購一隻，店主在理宜加拒絶一</p>
<p>於是，這位獨脚軍人永生永世莫想在這世界購鞋了丨這是他命運中應有之刦嗎？</p>
<p>由這件小事，我們可以看到我們的國家之糟糕到了何等的地步丨國家不幸，一切不行，天理，良心，法律：：：我們看這些東西在人間又起了什麽意義？嗚呼，又起了什麽意義？：：：</p>
<h3 id="c290">鼠患 <a href="#c290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— 文炳</p>
<p>我的寓室裏向來就有老鼠，近來越益多了，釀成了可怕的鼠患。</p>
<p>是某一天了，我還在貪眠，衖堂裏洗馬桶的沙沙之聲早已靜寂了，時候當然已在九時以外，忽然我被櫜櫜　的聲音震醒了，睜開着矇朧的眼，發現掛在東角上的那件襯衣在動。說到這件襯衣，雖然和我的關係很深丨丨是我的貼肉的衣服，而且質料又那麽好，是綢的。但是天氣一轉凉，我就彷彿討厭它起來了，任憑它兀自掛在東角上，懶得把它收拾，也懶得拿它去洗。然而這東西是不差的，除了實本身是綠質，上頭還積上了我身上的不少的油漬，恰恰是狡黠的老鼠所最愛的。等我爬下床去看，已發現襟面，背心，袖口，都被嚙成了無數的窟窿。我也就任它依樣的掛着，不想補，也不拿去洗。</p>
<p>這件事，給同房的鄔君知道了，他氣得很，順手就拿起一把拍蠅網，往四向的角落裏去搜索。這時，我又坐上了床，還懶得去揩面，只望着鄔君發呆，也許鄔君在怪我不帮他的忙。</p>
<p>自然，老鼠嚙傷了我的衣服，我也很疾惡。然而我覺得這是室内太凌亂了的原故，要想没有老鼠來擾，先得把室内整理一番，將一些壞的東西綂綂棄掉，爲什麽美子府上不見有老鼠，意哥哥家裏　是没有的，原來他們的寓室都很　究　壞的東西綂綂堆開，我也就想這樣辦。然而，我畢竟太昏庸了，而且很懶，只在嘴上說說，壞東西雖然舍命的摔，也畢竟還有那麽許多，室内仍然是凌亂的。</p>
<p>近來老鼠越益多起來了，它們全無顧忌，白天都走出來，在我的脚邊翻觔斗，哼，這眞使我又氣又好笑，但是我懶得很，它們溜開了一些，我也就算了。</p>
<p>不知怎的我却想起了二房東蓄的那頭碩大的白貓，於是我便去拜望二房東，把我的鼠患一五一十的告訴了他，他說老鼠是最可惡的，我這裏有一頭碩大的白貓，你捉去用用看，於是我便把白貓捉來了，我奉敬它是我的唯一的救星。果然開初的一夜，比較寗靜了些，老鼠不那樣翻箱倒籠的搗亂了，可是日子久了，又回復了先前的狀態，原來白貓雖然碩大，也是不中用的，只曉得要吃，只曉得亂呌，而且還隨地拉屎，老鼠知道了白貓是這樣的不中用，也就又毫無顧忌的作亂起來。有時甚至相率戲弄着白貓，白貓也許知道了自已原不中用，就偷偷的逃回去了。鄔君原來是不贊同捉白貓來的，明知它是不中用，要想除去鼠患，只有自已努力去打去捉，才是簡直的辦法。</p>
<p>白貓去後，老鼠更暴厲起來，我懶得很，日子久了，也就處之泰然了。掛在東角上的那件襯衣，已被嚙得那麽爛，就任它算了吧，我已不想再要。昨天翻看掛在左邊不遠的一件棉袍，也有老鼠嚙過了的痕跡，然而我也還懶得收拾。</p>
<p>鄔君見我這樣懶，不中用，他一個子也打得没興頭了，他也好久不則聲了　　今早有兩個朋友來會，他們看了我的鼠傷之物，很爲我惋惜，他們說給我想辦法，不過，要有報酬，或是把棉袍奉送給他們，或是掛在床前的許多畫片，任他們揀擇，或是奉送點皮箱裏的更好貴重的東西。</p>

<p>— 殊</p>
<p>十五號申報載中委石瑛先生談：「女子所消耗於脂粉香水等，亦在一百四十餘萬元之巨」。這個數目，蔚爲大觀丨足見女子消耗力總數到怎麽樣的程度了。連這在千百樣裝飾品中的小裝飾品，綂計得已經如此的驚人，若合其他較貴重的來，何止幾百萬元？</p>
<p>愛美是極普通的心理；尤其是女性，爭研鬥麗，大出其風頭。但這種現象，究竟是人工的「矯揉創造」。醜者往往會　運用過度的人工去彌補先天的缺憾，結果。「弄巧成拙」，反愈見其醜；倘使是「天生麗質」的，則又無須乎多此一舉，隨便把衣服整理清潔，越樸素越來得自然，標緻。雖然不如法國名小說家　哥派拉一見就會「迷住了幾天」，但至少可以節省了許多金錢。一人能夠這樣，擴大而普遍之，對國家社會，未始不是無益之事。不過在這舉凡非學摩登便算落伍的新時代，儘管這樣的說，影響却是一點也没有的。誰有權力干涉或限制呢？她們有的是錢，錢是她們自已的，自已消耗自已的錢，是本份事，可說是自由的。石瑛先生那句話裏面的一個「亦」字，似乎寓有一點歎惜，然也只能歎惜而已。抑尤有進者：除了嚥脂以外，其他一類的裝飾品，斷不能把消耗的責任，一古腦兒的推在女子身上去。一班摩登的男性，也是一樣的忙於消耗，忙於修飾，以期適合在他們認爲美的條件。自從女子的頭髮，時尚蓬鬆卷典後，如什麽髮油之類，却是男性的專消品了。男女是天生成的配合動物，女的要取悅於男的，所以就拚命的向其身體上頭面上用工夫：而男的想佔便宜，以博對方之一顧，一粲，以致於：：：，自然也竭其所能做到的方法，儘量的在大顯身手。「我旣媚君姿，君亦悅我顏」。如是，便「卿卿我我」，「鶼鶼鰈鰈」，摟抱蜜吻，雙宿雙飛，優哉游哉，得其所矣」丨但是，話應得說回來：消耗是兩性都有份的，不能單獨的責成某一方面，不過有多少之别而已。比方：價值達四百萬元之裝飾品，那麽，四份之一的消耗，毫無疑的要由摩登的男性負担：女子當然要担得重一點，就四份三吧。</p>

<p>做兒子的應什樣？</p>
<p>編者先生；</p>
<p>我是一個學徒，我的父母，結婚已有十多年了，他們的感情，本來是很好的，只因近年我父在外面娶了一位女人，所以對於我母親冷淡了。父親總是把所賺的錢，多數交給這女人；而對我母親，則　　不　。使我母夙夜啼哭，悶悶不樂。我母是一個舊式女子，亦現代婦女可比，故極力忍耐，始終不言離異。我覺得如此下去，我的母親　非自殺，亦將氣死。故望先生早日指示我母子數人唯一的生路，或使我父親覺悟的方法。臨頴急迫，不勝盼覆，敬請</p>
<p>撰安　李浩然謹上</p>
<p>Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ</p>
<p>編者按：這件事，照法律講，即不願向李君的父親，提起「重婚」之訴，也可向這女子提起「妨害家庭」之訴；這是釜底抽薪的辦法。不過勝訴以後，李君的父親，是否能不因此而更懷恨在心，恢復舊時感情，殊屬難說。這就是法律窮的時候呀丨</p>
<p>如眞物質方面，勉强可以維持，那麽我們主張，還是放過了李君的父親。聽他自由，或者將來倒會有自覺的一天。此外李君更應當努力進取，使你母親在精神方面，得有相當安慰，覺得前途還有希望。一個人有了希望心，「自殺」與「氣死」，自然可以不成問題了。</p>

<p>— 張老三</p>
<p>三十四舅父家</p>
<p>和資本家談話，和見要人没有多大區别丨並不是我不滿意我舅父徐炳南的緣故，應該「知難而退」，「適可而止」，三年來的磨礪生活使我明瞭一切。舅父已明明告訴你，今年没有多少日子了，你要等着，明年來的機會。本來機會從窗外飛進來，不要放牠從門裏逃出去，人生到處是機會，在没有多少日子的今年歲尾，急急什麽呢？而况我還年青跟着明年來的有許許多多明年哩丨</p>
<p>那筆意外的生意，和表姊的勸進，對於我還是個美麗的夢境。</p>
<p>「舅舅，我改天再來罷。」我站起身來。</p>
<p>舅父瞇了眼，點點頭，兩道濃密的白烟從鼻孔中噴出來，表示他對於這件事的處置十分滿意。</p>
<p>「外甥到舅母家裏那有不吃飯的道理？」二姨太太從烟榻上跳起來，舉起手臂瞧了瞧手表「正是吃中飯了，大小姐，吩咐廚房裏飯開到樓上來」。</p>
<p>慧姊没有理會她的話。</p>
<p>「舅母，隔日再來叨擾。我出門的時候，朋友没有知道，恐怕他們要等我」。我没有候龜回話「舅舅，我去了，有事情可以請慧姊寫信通知你。」</p>
<p>「我曉得的丨」慧姊把我推出去了那間充滿了鴉片氣息的鐵床底時候，那特有的嗓音「有什麽客氣呢，：：：」還從裏面送出來。</p>
<p>走下樓梯，同意似的向門外走去，那門房的笑臉又不遲不早從門房口探出來，彎着腰說：</p>
<p>「小姐，要汽車嗎？」</p>
<p>慧姊搖搖頭，直送到門外來，她似乎還没有回進去的意思。我忙攔住了說：「不必送我了」。</p>
<p>「我也到社裏去望望敏姊。」她注視着地上移前去的脚尖，心中好像在思量一件了不得的事。</p>
<p>我不好意思過分攔住她，並着肩，在煤屑路上慢慢向徐家匯的電車站走去。</p>
<p>三十五熱情的微笑</p>
<p>三次到舅父家，在三種情形之下我來回在這條煤屑路上。第一次，和敏姊分了手，抱着巨大的希望在講經大會的盛典中失望了歸來；出方外墅側門的時候，我像喪家之犬一般抱着自已沉重的步伐。第二次，爲了三角戀愛的誤會，在一個五月中旬的清晨，偷偷地來向表姊剖白一切，然而半天的勾留，帶給我二個月的重病。今天，再重臨這條印滿了傷痕的煤屑路，和慧姊並着肩默默地走，回憶她不能認識我而向她同伴笑語的時候，我不禁感傷起來。慧姊無論如何·她對於我有一種不可遏止的情感發生證之她最近對於我的一切，她的用心已被事實證明了，她想從敏姊手中將我奪過來。我踏着自已的一簇黑影，煤屑所傾軋發出來的聲音像我心頭的血在沸騰一樣，我包圍在兩個不同女性的懷抱中，脫離正誼社而依附舅父，無論他的計劃在一個月後的明年成爲事實。於我是絲毫没有分别的。不過我對於慧姊並没有切齒的仇恨，她接受了我的勸告，從都市姑娘的地獄陷中跳出身來，爲了我愛戀着她；但是我從惡勢力壓迫着的故鄉逃出來，我懷着極大的希望，現在不是我們戀愛的時候。</p>
<p>我斜眼注視慧姊，她的走路似乎被什麽牽引似的，也像在計數自已的步伐。這條短短的煤屑路，今天走來特别的加長，我幾次鼓了勇氣想向慧姊吐露幾句久已藴藏在心頭的話，衝到喉頭，就再不能吐出來。走着走着，地上的人影漸縮漸短，至於完全蹂躪在我們四條腿下。太陽已經爬到中午，走過那家我飽餐過一頓的小飯館，幾輛黄包車停歇在門前，車夫捧了大碗的飯狼吞虎嚥，看來他們像永遠没有旁的事情擾亂他們的頭腦，放去了飯碗，拖着空車做也惟一的工作去了。</p>
<p>在電車站口站住了，遠遠的望去没有來的車。在走路的時候，還能免强維持無言的寂寞，現在停步在電車站旁，又僅僅我們兩個人，於是我被逼出一句話來。</p>
<p>「慧姊，你没有吃飯？」我目光注視着那羣黄包車夫。</p>
<p>「肚子餓了？」</p>
<p>「我想起在這家館子裏吃了一頓飯，生了兩個月病。」我搖搖頭說：</p>
<p>「過去的事談什麽丨我不倍着生兩個月病嗎」</p>
<p>說話的口吻是那樣惱怒，終於自已笑了出來，一個忠誠的熱情的微笑。</p>

<p>— 趙頣年</p>
<p>「在我一生的任何一個階段裏，没有像現在這樣的快活了。這是一個新的開始，新的前程；已往的都像一面弄污了的鏡子，擦抹乾凈了。</p>
<p>「五年以來，這是第一次我覺得扮一個我所能扮的角兒。這是一個巨大的機會，這種歡愉和感謝，我要歸功於嘉寳小姐，但是我没有希望可以償還。</p>
<p>「潦倒的我，已經過了很我的時候了。我自已都覺得十二分的驚奇，我是如何從崇高的榮譽的天上，摔到無人過問的萬丈深淵裏。但是如今啊，同從前一樣的迅速，一樣的令人吃驚，我又走到復興的路上來了。這是一個何等詫異的經騐丨</p>
<p>「這是絶大的榮耀，能在銀幕上同嘉寳小姐重行合作。她是一個偉大的藝人，偉大的女子。這不是一個秘密，因了她的能力，使我能扮到這個角兒。她相信我的不幸，她要糾正人們對於我的錯誤。我的唯一希望和企念，就是我是應該如何的做，庶幾乎對得往她對我的信心。丨約翰吉爾勃這樣說着。</p>
<p>ThisisColossal這句是約翰吉爾勃說慣的一句話。</p>
<p>嘉寳不顧一切反對，一切閒話，努力的折服了米高梅當局，使約翰簽成合同，做她新片當中男主角。</p>
<p>他們碰頭了丨丨約翰緊張的，迷糊的，在這意想不到的喜訊。丨嘉寳呢，誰知道她感到什麽，想到什麽？</p>
<p>倒底是我們勇敢的約翰先開口了。「好極了」丨他高興地說。在嘉寳的心裏，哭然侵入這個舊日常聽慣了約翰所說的一句話了。在八年之前，當他們開拍「肉體與情魔」一片時候，這一個Colossal英國字，是約翰敎授我們嬌羞笨拙的瑞典女郎的第一個字啊」。</p>
<p>從約翰娶了「英娜克萊」JnaClaira一直到簽這張合同時，他們没有見過面，也没有說過話。這些年裏，他們在同一攝影場裏工作。嘉寳扶搖直上，踏着了幸福的高梯；約翰這顆星呢，跌下去，直到差不多看不見一些光芒。</p>
<p>約翰的聲名一天一天的下落。祇是因爲合同的關係，米高梅祇得照舊付他薪水。直到期滿，他馬上就被解雇了。在這不幸的久長的幾年裏，他差不多一點成績都没有。他極難得到攝影場來，在路上遇見舊朋友們，他像蛇一樣的躱開了希望他們没有看見他。他自認是失敗在永久不能恢復的地位了，他的名字也再不會在電光中閃躍了。</p>
<p>米高梅公司驅逐出來的約翰，到福司公司去碰碰碰機會。（好多年前，他曾在福司攝製「廿載深仇」TheCountofMonteCristo）他也曾試試做導演。但是都失敗了。</p>
<p>約翰昔日的英名，像火一般熄滅了。這是何等巨大的恥辱啊丨這個黑面大眼睛的英雄啊，曾經沉醉了若干少女的心。丨少女們帶着情人們到電影院來看約翰，希望他們學約翰。但是他爲什麽這樣的不幸呢丨</p>
<p>但是，小姐，請你不要灰心。有一個名呌嘉寳的女人，已經把約翰帶回來給你了。她是他一度的甜心，她是一個偉大的女子，她把他的錦繡前程拉回來給他。他的失敗，在她心裏的痛苦，比他自已更要深，更要透。雖然這不是具體的痛苦。</p>
<p>「克瑞士丁娜皇后」OueenChristina，就是她和約翰合演的片子。劇本上關於約翰一部，都是她呌人重行寫成，特别適合約翰的個性和。她相信這一張片子，可以挽回他已失的榮光。（下略）</p>

<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>（ＲatterＲomancee）</p>
<p>丨雷電華出品　大上海開映丨</p>
<p>一部開玩笑的影片。</p>
<p>不過，我們覺得作者將那位房東的確寫得很好。將一間極簡陋的屋頂房間，同時租給男女二人。而同時又要兩個房客都覺得滿意，嗇吝，奸滑，幾個小錢亦得斤斤計較，十足的市儈的素描。小商人特有的風度，在作者的描寫中惟妙惟肖，十分生動而可愛。</p>
<p>這種人對於久居都市的小市民們，的確是非常熟識的，因此，這種人物很可以敎我們發生眞切的同感。</p>
<p>同樣，作者對於那屬於小市民層的男女二房客，在生活的描寫方面，也寫得很眞切。那位少女爲了收入的拮据，不得不由大房間遷入擱樓，而且是和另一男人換班居住。男的呢，遇着了大雨，便没有衣裳可換，得在洗衣作門口淋着雨等十五分鐘。：：：諸如此類，小市民們爲生活而掙扎，其各種生活方式，未嘗不是近於眞實的描寫。</p>
<p>但是作者對於這些，是採取什麽態度的呢？他不就正面描寫，而以嘻笑的態度將他們的生活美化起來。當然我們並不反對喜劇形式的運用，但對於某種主題，却因爲喜劇的形式而减少了劇的嚴重性，假使有誰反問一句，卓别麟對於小市民的生活又何嘗不是喜劇的形式表現出來？不錯。可是這一影片的作者却比較卓别麟氏差得太遠了。</p>
<p>因爲要滑稽化，因爲要有噱頭，於是便搆結成一個十分勉强的故事。男女二人同住在一個屋子，那有長久不認得的呢？這種巧事，不會使人相信的。至於寫他和她都彼此相愛，而同時又寫他們都受着另一異性的追求，很明白的不會給人何等好感，而祗是爲了故事本身的興趣。</p>
<p>這裏似乎接近了一個住的問題。不管作者是有意的將嚴重的問題輕鬆化，然而在選擇題材方面，却可認出美國電影是開始注意到社會問題了。這是以前少有的現狀。</p>
<h3 id="c297">好萊塢新發現伴侶式的離婚 <a href="#c297" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e297" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">297</a></h3>
<p>— 福</p>
<p>好萊塢眞是一個無奇不有的地方，結婚和離婚的花式，尤其是繁不勝數。我們或者聽見過，但是許多人一定還是不懂的，什麽呌做伴侶式的結婚（CompanionateMarriage），但是現在又新添了一種伴侶式的離婚（CompanionateDivotce）了什麽呌做伴侶式的結婚呢？簡單的說，就是結婚之後，各人仍舊繼續各人原有的生活。或是照舊分居，或是同居，大家不干涉大家的自由。總而言之，夫婦間的生活如同兩個朋友的相處而已。講到伴侶式的離婚呢，簡便的說，就是已經結婚的夫婦，現在分居了，但是並不離婚；非但不離婚，並且在兩人約會好了，仍舊可以互相訪問，或作一二日的歡聚。爲什麽要行這種伴侶式的離婚呢？一則或者因爲夫妻各人有各人的事業，同居容易分心，家務雜事，尤其容易使女人失却自由，因此他們就恊議分居了。第二或者夫妻意見不合，但感情還没有全部破裂，因此他們就想出這個法子來，作爲一個極好的折衷辦法。</p>
<p>這個伴侶式的離婚，是誰發明的呢？原來係好萊塢明星格羅利亞史蒂華（GjoriaStuart）和她的丈夫戈登紐惠爾（GordonNewell）發明的。紐惠爾係一個美術家，精於彫刻。他們夫妻的感情，並没有破裂，但是因爲各人有各人的事業，感覺到同居的時間不經濟，精神不經濟，因而恊議分居了。他們在没有分居之前，有一位新聞記者去訪問他們。他們還對那新聞記者，侃侃而談伴侶式離婚的意義呢。紐惠爾談話的大意是，他們分居的意義，並不在「分居」二字上，而是在「分工」二字上，就是分開工作而已。史蒂華說：「我的工作是拍影片。我應當拿我全部的光陰，用在攝影場中。因此，我就不能再照顧戈登的事。並且同居了，大家的光陰和工作，都有妨碍，於是就不能不想個兩全的法子。那就是我們想實行的「伴侶式的離婚」。</p>

<p>克拉克蓋博因禍得福</p>
<p>克拉克蓋博本年秋季一場大病，幾幾乎　終正寢。現在已經漸漸告愈了。他非但毛病好了，醫生說他還可以康强到老哩。什麽道理呢？原來克拉克蓋博本來有兩種危險的毛病。一種是喉龍口扁桃腺的腐爛，一種是極厲害的盲腸炎。他自從進了米曲羅公司之後，工作極忙，所以雖然身體越來越壞，但是因爲工作的忙迫，總没有工夫去割治。這回好了。他一場大病，幾乎死去。因此，他就聽了醫生的命令，决定將這兩種毛病，根本解决。於是他在大病略好之後，先割喉龍，治理扁桃腺的發炎。等到喉龍略好，就接連將他的肚子開了。這本來是死馬當活馬醫的辦法，不知克拉克蓋博，竟能夠得到良好的經過，而他兩種致命的毛病，旣然除掉了，所以醫生說，他可以壽齊期頭了。</p>

<p>— 素因</p>
<p>貝爾靜心聽奇奥講完了，他忽然了解於勞萊和亞梅締結婚姻的意味。他很羞澀地拉着奇奥的手，他說：「請你等一等。我有一句話要和你講。」他起初很畏縮，但是他終於囁嚅着繼續講了出來：「我是太大胆了，我没有勇氣去想，但是我却敢」希望你能在你的芳心之内，留一些地位給一個没有多大幸運的人：：：哦，我知道我不應當這樣放肆，在這個時候問你這個話，你現在的心太充滿了快樂了丨但是我可以改天再來，要是你讓我回來見你的話。我現在在波士頓，已經尋到了一個位置，所以丨」他說到這裡停住了，他很誠懇地看着奇奥的臉。　　暫時的大家都默然無聲的相對站着，各人有各人秘密的心事。他們的臉。很慢很慢的，漸漸顯露了一種新奇的歡樂。於是奇奥抓住了貝爾的臂膀，拉了他望裡面走。她很得意地把他介紹給大家了。她講了許多關乎他們在紐約的事情，但是關乎他們兩個人的新秘密，丨那是太甜蜜，太寳貴了，現在還没有到公開的時候哩丨最後她說：「他帶來了一本書，我的書現在已經出版了。</p>
<p>於是大家喧嘩地圍攏起來，恭賀着她搶着要看那本新書。他們很熱誠地歡迎着貝爾敎授，謝着他待奇奥的一切好意。貝爾亦極其大方地和他們談着，每個人呌着他們的名字，這顯然地使大家驚奇起來。於是奇奥告訴他們道：「你們他都認識，因爲你們的名字，都在我那本書裡，所以他都認識的。」貝爾道：「但是你們不用愁，奇奥寫的時候，是拿着一支慈愛的筆寫的，可以使看的人，和你們一同　着歡笑着」。他說完了，又四週看着，好像尋什麽久别的東西似的。他忽然看見了那座鋼琴於是他低聲的說道：「哦，這就是那鋼琴」。</p>
<p>「貝爾，請你坐下來彈一下」，奇奥說。於是貝爾毫不推辭地坐了下來，他的手輕輕地觸着那鋼琴的鍵，立時好像點鐵成金似的，那琴就發生一個幽越的音調出來。大家寂靜地聽着，各人的臉上，都顯出極深刻的感觸，於是貝爾又開始唱了起來。勞倫斯先生背靠在椅子上，眼睛閉着。約翰勃羅克偷偷兒握着美格的手，美格報之以嫣然的一笑。姑老太太滿面的冰霜，似乎亦都溶化了。勞萊和亞梅站在鋼琴旁邊勞萊的手摟着亞梅的纖腰。奇奥呢？她看着貝爾破敗不堪的形狀，似乎已是一往情深了。她低低問着媽嬭：「你看他好不好？媽嬭拭着快樂的淚，點着頭表示許可的意思，心裡想奇奥的羅曼斯，一向以爲是不會開花的，現在已經在那兒怒牙勃發了。（完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Central Government Draws Crack Troops to Suppress Bandits in Fujian; Fujian Side's Military Operations Focus on the Central Route; Situation in Zhenghe and Shouning Tense; Chen Shaokuan Flies to Jiangxi to Meet Chiang <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain military authority stated that the Fujian side's actions were ruining the country and destroying the party, and military personnel from all sides had been vying to volunteer to Chiang Kai-shek to launch punitive expeditions. The central government had long decided on a comprehensive plan to respond. Recently, in addition to dispatching a large army to be stationed in northern Fujian, crack troops were also drawn from the bandit suppression forces in Jiangxi Province and advanced towards Fujian from western Jiangxi. It is expected that they will be fully equipped around the 20th of this month. Currently, the opposing side has shown signs of invading Zhejiang, but our side is well prepared and possesses overwhelming strength, making it an easy matter to eliminate them. Outside speculation seems to be filled with worry and fear, believing that the expedition against Fujian will inevitably affect the bandit suppression campaign. However, little do they know that suppressing Fujian is equivalent to suppressing bandits; it simply means that the bandit area has been slightly expanded. Our side is taking advantage of their dispersed nature to more easily eliminate them. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Military information indicates that the war on the Fujian-Zhejiang border is imminent. The frontline defenses of the central army have been properly deployed. The Liu Heding division, originally stationed in Jian'ou, has now been moved to Songxi and Zhenghe, and the defense of Jian'ou has been taken over by the _____ division. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) Yu Jishi, based on an 18th telegram from troops stationed in Taishun, stated that, according to reports from secret agents sent to Pingnan, and according to people coming from Gutian, it is widely rumored among the rebel troops in Gutian that they will soon advance towards Zhejiang via Pingnan. (Hangzhou) Reliable sources indicate that, because the central army is fully deployed in the northern Fujian area, including Jian'ou and Shaowu, and because the Liu Heding and Zhou Zhiqun units originally stationed there have established tight defenses, the Fujian army cannot develop along the left route. Therefore, the Fujian army is now changing its offensive strategy, having already transferred a large number of troops, gradually advancing and concentrating towards Zhenghe and Shouning from Gutian and Songxi, forcing the Red bandits in the Shouning area to invade our Taishun and Qingyuan along the central route. At the same time, they are claiming that they will attack Pingyang and Ruian on the Zhejiang border from Fuding, using a feint to the east while attacking the west, in order to contain the central army. However, the central army has long seen through the Fujian side's plan and has completed deployments along both the central and right routes. If the enemy invades, they will definitely be met with a counterattack. (19th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Hangzhou) The Aviation Administration dispatched three planes led by Shen Dexie on the morning of the 19th to reconnoiter northern Fujian, including Pingnan and Shouning. They returned to Hangzhou in the evening to report. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Xu Peigen Discusses the Military Situation <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Hangzhou) Xu Peigen stated on the 19th that the rebel invasion of Zhejiang was originally divided into three routes: one towards Jiangshan via Jian'ou and Pucheng; the second towards Tiantai via Fuding, Nanping, and Yongjia; and the third taking the route of Gutian and Pingnan to attack Taishun and Jingning. Currently, the first route is difficult to advance due to inconvenient transportation and the gathering of our large army. The second and third routes are mountainous and the defenses are solid, making it impossible to advance into Zhejiang. A small number of rebel troops have been discovered along the way from Shouning and Pingnan to Taishun. The Zhenghe rebel army appears to be advancing towards Qingyuan. There is also rebel troop movement near the county towns of Shouning and Fuan north of Zhenghe. However, there is no trace of them south of Zhenghe. The defenses in Qingyuan and Longquan are solid and safe. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e4">Yu Jishi Sends Telegrams to Border Counties <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Hangzhou) Yu Jishi, Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Security Department, stated that Zhejiang Province borders Fujian and Jiangxi and is strategically important. All border counties should strictly guard against bandits and rebels causing disturbances. All inland counties should do their utmost to eliminate and suppress them. Bridges and telegraph lines on railways and highways are critical for military transport and should be vigorously protected. Yesterday, he specially telegraphed the county magistrates and heads of the defense corps to comply. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Chen Shaokuan Flies to Jiangxi Province to Meet Chiang <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) In recent days, the Fujian side has been pressing closer to the Zhejiang border step by step. The central government originally hoped to resolve the issue through political means, but this is no longer possible. If necessary, the navy, army, and air force will be fully mobilized to eliminate that faction within a specified period. The Executive Yuan meeting on the 19th discussed this for a long time and decided to dispatch Navy Minister Chen Shaokuan to Jiangxi by plane to report to Chiang Kai-shek and request instructions on the navy's deployment. Chen left the meeting at 10 a.m., before it was over, and went directly to the airport to board the China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Hankou plane to Nanchang, before going on to Fuzhou to meet Chiang at the front. Chen said before departing that he would return to Nanjing within a day. (19th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e40">Fiscal Urgency Requires Reducing Expenditure <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— Geng</p>
<p>Our country is in an extremely serious situation with both internal and external troubles. The government's reliance to overcome the difficulties is that finance is the most important plan. In recent years, the financial situation has long been unsustainable. After the September 18th Incident, the Northeast Customs was seized. Issuing public bonds and increasing taxes have already exhausted the people. How can they bear the pain of robbing Peter to pay Paul? There is no other way. In addition to rationally increasing revenue in finance, there is only one way: to be realistic and reduce expenditure.</p>
<p>There are countless ways to reduce expenditure. In short, there are three main points:</p>
<p>1. Eliminate redundant organizations. Since bureaucraticism has deeply penetrated people's hearts, whether at the central or local level, in any kind of organization, most of them do not choose people based on the task, but rather add tasks based on the person. There are many examples of superfluous parts and unnecessary additions. For example, each province competes to set up commissioner's offices, which are tasked with carrying out provincial orders and supervising county administration. Their powers are similar to those of the prefectures and circuits of the Qing Dynasty, and they compete with today's civil affairs bureaus. It is clear that they are not absolutely necessary. Each office governs an average of five or six counties, and some even concurrently serve as county magistrates and security commanders. All aspects of the counties' administrative successes and failures, the people's suffering, and local security are concentrated on one person. Who has the supernatural power to overcome multiple responsibilities? Moreover, with a higher level above the county, this layering is redundant. The promulgation of laws and the transmission of documents are often delayed due to unnecessary detours, resulting in missed opportunities. If we can strictly eliminate organizations nationwide, we can at least reduce the total number by one-third. In terms of financial expenditure, we can also reduce some of the waste.</p>
<p>2. Eliminate redundant public officials. Government agencies, large and small, must have a large number of redundant personnel that can be dismissed. This can be seen in the announcements made when the heads of various agencies replace personnel. Whenever a new head of an agency takes office, they initially say that they will never dismiss anyone. Then they will reduce personnel. Finally, they will add their own people. The dismissal does not lead to the abandonment of government affairs, and the addition does not greatly improve efficiency. As a result, old friends occupy important positions, and relatives and friends fill the government. Some even hold multiple positions, with empty titles and remote leadership, wasting huge salaries. Personnel who have served in political institutions for many years often receive high salaries but have no special skills. They spend their entire lives immersed in politics and become permanent parasites. Other expenses, such as so-called secret funds and activity funds, are arbitrarily inflated and must be strictly eliminated along with redundant personnel. Government expenses can be reduced considerably. After the redundant personnel have been dismissed, if the duties are indeed heavy, we should also be careful in using people and not add personnel rashly. In this time of serious national crisis, it is also justifiable for one person to handle two affairs. Moreover, public officials should have a spirit of dedication to the country.</p>
<p>3. Cherish material resources. The long-standing habits of the officialdom are mostly about indulgence in sensual pleasures and extravagance. Public goods of institutions are especially not cherished. For example, people casually use a sheet of letter paper to write down each other's names or a few words. Public paper, pens, and ink are used by the entire private family. This is almost a common occurrence. Although this is very trivial, if thousands of agencies and everyone does this, the number of sheets of paper wasted over months and years can fill many buildings. For example, the gazettes of various agencies are often printed with high quality. The photos of the heads of agencies and officials are especially required to be printed on fine paper, regardless of the cost. Moreover, some officials pay no attention to construction but first build grandly, equipping them lavishly, to show off their wealth. They do not know that every bit of waste is the blood and sweat of the common people. They do not cherish the country's treasury and do not think of the difficulty of maintaining material resources. The harm is not insignificant. We believe that for all industrial construction and cultural and spiritual undertakings that benefit the country, we should not hesitate to exhaust human and material resources to develop them as much as possible. As for public documents and reports that are discarded after reading, or places where individuals and institutions use for work, residence, and leisure, it is all right to keep it simple and to ease the financial burden.</p>
<p>Looking at the above-mentioned matters, except for cherishing material resources, which has rarely been explicitly advocated, for the rest, such as eliminating redundant organizations and dismissing redundant public officials, the central government has repeatedly resolved to implement austerity policies. However, in practice, it seems that it has not been possible to implement them, or that they have even become more severe. If we continue in this way without seeking to implement austerity and vigorously advocating thrift, the crisis in the financial future cannot be predicted.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Britain and the United States Compete to Expand Their Navies, the Goal is to Contain Japan - "Hundred Eyes" Publishes an Article <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Rome The "Stampa" newspaper published an article discussing the naval arms race among the world's five major naval powers. The author of the article is signed with a pen name called "Hundred Eyes". It is said that he is an important figure in the Italian naval circles. The article first discusses the importance of Japan's position, saying that Japan is a direct element in the naval policy of the United States, and that Japan is an indirect element in the naval policy of the United Kingdom. The article predicts that in the 1935 naval conference of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan, there will be serious difficulties between the three major powers. None of the three countries intends to back down. The author also said that the debate between France and Italy on the quality and quantity of their navies is now only secondary. If the navies of France and Italy want to be at the same level as the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan, and can keep pace with the three major naval powers when necessary, they must spend a huge amount of national treasury. This is not only impossible for France and Italy, but also unwilling to do so. On the contrary, France and Italy may as well cooperate in legal and political affairs to build harmony and peace in Europe and the world. (19th Havas Dispatch) (London) A book called "Jane's Fighting Ships" was released today. There is a preface in it, mentioning the construction of the Japanese navy, saying that the Japanese "Mogami" class cruiser is named as 8,500 tons and carries 15 six-inch guns. Compared to the US Brooklyn class cruiser, which reduces the displacement by 1,500 tons, how can it carry this gun? This is really difficult to understand. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota stated on November 28 regarding future diplomatic policy that it is better to have agreements between the two countries concerned than to have open discussions with many countries. According to a telegram from Ambassador Taketomi to the United States, President Roosevelt also stated on the 9th that the establishment of a treaty to adjust trade relations between the two countries would solve the tariff problem. This is a desire to shift from international coordination to reciprocal agreement. The reciprocal agreement with Colombia in South America, which was signed on the 15th, is its first step. Since the diplomatic policies of Japan and the United States are converging, future diplomatic progress is very noteworthy. (19th Dempo Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e43">France Makes Concessions to Germany, a New Turning Point in the Military Reduction Stalemate - France Allows German Army to Increase to 200,000 Men - Must Sign Non-Aggression Treaty with Four Neighbors <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) Today, it was learned from reliable sources that as a result of secret talks in London and Paris in recent days, France will be able to express important concessions in its reply to German Chancellor Hitler's military proposals. The most important of these is the fact that France can accept a compromise on the German request to change 100,000 long-term recruited soldiers into 300,000 short-term militia soldiers. If Germany can sign a non-aggression treaty with its four neighbors, then its army may as well be expanded to 200,000 short-term militia soldiers. In addition, although it will be clearly stated that German armaments should still be restricted by the Treaty of Versailles, it is also hoped that the French government will no longer demand the international management that Germans oppose the most. In addition, it is also willing to shorten the experimental supervision period for military reduction next year by two years. The French government is now engaged in drafting this reply, which will be sent to Berlin in about the next week, and a copy will be made as a memorandum and sent to the British government for reference. It is said that this concession by the French government is the result of separate contacts between French Ambassador to Germany Poncet, British Foreign Secretary Simon, British Ambassador to Germany Phipps, and French Foreign Minister Poncet. Political commentators here believe that this new shift in the situation will greatly help promote the work of the disarmament conference and avoid Germans from criticizing France's strict attitude.

<p>(London) When the House of Commons met today, Conservative Party member Lockland Puensheng suggested that in order to prevent other countries from continuing to withdraw from the League of Nations and to enhance the solidarity of the powers, a committee should be appointed to draft a proposal for the reorganization of the League of Nations and submit it to Geneva. Prime Minister MacDonald replied that he could not do this and said that the British government intended to make all kinds of efforts to enable the League of Nations to carry out its affairs.

<p>(London) Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Eden said in the House of Commons today in response to questions that, to the best of his knowledge, the claim that most European countries are gradually increasing the strength of their aircraft specially built for bombing is not true. It is said that all types of aircraft can be used for bombing to a certain extent. Articles 34 and 35 of the British draft disarmament treaty are intended to deal with this difficulty. The recommendations contained in these provisions continue to represent the British government's policy. The British government believes that the disarmament meeting is of utmost importance and will strive to achieve a compromise that includes all issues. (18th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Algiers, Africa The French "Long-Distance African Flight Team" led by General Weillman completed its journey with all 28 aircraft, landing at Midia Airport here at 10:35 this morning. Minister of Aviation Guth specially rushed here from Paris to welcome them. The weather was bad a few days ago, but this morning it cleared up again. The sun shone, and the snow-white peaks of the mountains in the distance were beautiful. Local people, having heard the news in advance, gathered at the airport from 8:00 this morning. Civil and military officials arrived one after another. At 10:00, Minister of Aviation Guth arrived at the scene, inspected the troops, and saluted the national flag. Not long after, the sound of aircraft echoed in the air, and more than 20 aircraft flew in formation. The aircraft driven by General Weillman landed first, and Guth rushed forward to welcome him. The military band played the national anthem, and the remaining aircraft landed one after another. Guth waited for the drivers to gather and congratulated them, saying that this would add glory to French aviation. Then, General Weillman thanked Guth on behalf of the entire team. At this time, someone brought a telegram from Governor General Lebrun, the content of which was to ask Guth to convey his congratulations. At noon, the aviators had a simple meal at the Governor's Office, and there was also a grand celebration in the evening. According to reports, the entire flight was more than 20,000 kilometers long and lasted 40 days. It was not an attempt to break any records, but only to test the durability of aircraft manufactured in large quantities. (18th Havas Dispatch)</p>

On that day, local police patrolled a street and found three suspicious people in an empty house. The police went forward to question them because the place was a must-pass for the King and Queen's parade. Unexpectedly, the three thugs took the lead and fired at the police with guns, killing one policeman on the spot and injuring another. The three thugs were about to escape, but other police had heard the sound and arrived, arresting two people. Later, one person was arrested in the suburbs. The three were all imprisoned.

<p>Montevideo Today, the Pan-American Conference officially announced that the dispute between Bolivia and Paraguay over the Gran Chaco border, after five years of conflict and bloodshed, has signed armistice conditions and accepted the mediation method of submitting it to the International Court of Justice. However, the country has lost more than 12,000 soldiers in the two years of war. The armistice conditions stipulate that a non-stationed area be demarcated in the Gran Chaco, protected and monitored by military personnel from other countries, and that both sides immediately release prisoners of war. This agreement can be said to be the greatest achievement of the concentrated efforts of the Pan-American Conference Subcommittee and the specialized representatives of the League of Nations Arbitration Commission in recent weeks. At the beginning of the war between the two countries, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Peru jointly mediated, and the Committee of Investigation and Reconciliation, which met in Washington in 1929, also paid close attention to the Gran Chaco dispute, especially its economic relations and topography, hoping to find a sea route for Bolivia. However, it was not successful. The crux of the case is that Bolivia is located in the center of the continent and lacks a free sea route. It is expected that when the Hague Court of Arbitration makes its judgment in the future, it will also pay attention to Bolivia's desire to obtain a sea route. (19th National Telegram)</p>

<p>(Washington) The United States may recently make important decisions on its diplomatic policy toward Latin American countries, that is, to revise the treaty signed with Central American countries in 1923 as an exchange condition for recognizing the revolutionary governments of Central American countries. The US State Department has decided in principle to recognize the Martina government of the Republic of El Salvador, but on the condition that the current treaties of Central America be slightly revised. A conference of Central American countries may be held in the capital of Panama. At that conference, if the Central American countries are willing to declare the abolition of the current Central American treaties, they may take the opportunity to announce it. There is little doubt that Costa Rica and El Salvador will declare abolition. As for Nicaragua, Honduras, and Guatemala, as of now, they have expressed their willingness to maintain the current treaties, but they must be revised. (19th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>Vienna The International Inter-Regional Conference of Catholics here issued a report today by its chairman, Bishop Enzel, stating that no fewer than one million people died of famine in Soviet Russia in this year alone. Even the most fertile areas of Ukraine and the Caucasus have become disaster areas. The report further stated that the disaster situation in Soviet Russia is truly the most tragic situation in the world, and cannibalism is also a common occurrence in the disaster areas. What is even more strange is that although the disaster situation in Russia is so serious this time, overseas countries are actually facing overproduction with no place to sell, and countries around the world are holding meetings to seek restrictions on food production. Furthermore, countries are finding ways to destroy large quantities of food, but they do not know that this food can be transported to Russia using abandoned ships to save the lives of millions of people. The report concluded that the disaster situation in Soviet Russia is now showing signs of worsening, so all civilized countries should find ways to provide assistance as soon as possible to fulfill their responsibility to help each other.

However, the Russian side does not understand Manchuria's true intentions, and falsely accuses and reports unlawful acts as political conspiracies.

<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the reorganization of the South Manchuria Railway (SMR), Hirai, the Army Paymaster who was on a business trip to Manchuria, returned to Tokyo last night on the special express "Fuji." He immediately went to the Army Ministry to submit the reorganization plan to Yamaoka, the Director of the Military Affairs Bureau. Before entering Tokyo, Paymaster Hirai told reporters in the train that although the contents of the SMR reorganization plan could absolutely not be disclosed, he was confident that there was absolutely no shortage of funds and that the limit for expanding the issuance of corporate bonds was sufficient, so there was no need to worry. Even if the Ministry of Colonial Affairs opposes it, we have a full chance of winning. (19th, Communication Society)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Army Ministry received a detailed report from Paymaster Hirai regarding the SMR reorganization last night and decided to start the review from today. After consulting with the General Staff Headquarters, the Army's attitude will be determined when the work is completed, and then consultations will be held with the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and other relevant authorities. As for the general outline, it is determined to overcome all difficulties and implement the original plan. (19th, Communication Society)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After Lin and Hatta, the President and Vice President of the SMR, arrived in Tokyo, the SMR reorganization plan was handed over to the central government. The Ministry of Finance, in view of the importance of this case, has independently studied the problem and plans to submit the Ministry of Finance's SMR reorganization plan when necessary and make concrete preparations. The Ministry of Finance's attitude is to absolutely oppose the so-called fundamental policy of the Kwantung Army to control the supervision of the SMR. It also holds the opinion that the SMR's development of Manchurian resources must be supplied with a large amount of capital from mainland Japan. The Ministry of Finance has the right to supervise the raising of funds in the central government, so it considers the financial market situation in mainland Japan and guides the SMR, so that the "State of Manchuria" can develop healthily. Reorganizing the SMR into an ordinary holding company would merely be a management company, losing the interest of the enterprise and preventing capital from entering "Manchuria." (19th, Japanese Alliance)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Colonial Affairs not only strongly opposes the SMR reorganization plan, but also the government leaders such as Prime Minister Saito, Finance Minister Takahashi, and Home Minister Yamamoto all oppose it. Publicly appointed members of the House of Peers, such as the Koseikai, also have dissenting opinions. The Seiyukai and Minseito parties in the House of Representatives have not explicitly criticized it due to the influence of the military, but generally oppose it. The reasons for the opposition from various aspects are: 1. According to the on-site plan, the SMR will be disintegrated and become a holding company. This is what happens when companies are merged into one company. If this one company is separated this time, it will lose its essence. 2. The so-called holding company has supervisory power over the companies under its control. If the plan is approved this time, the supervisory power will be in the hands of the military, and the holding company will become a simple securities company, resulting in instability. 3. Investors will be hesitant to invest in such an unstable company. Also, it must be said that it is a mistake for the military to have supervisory power. 4. Among the separated companies, railways and coal mines can be operated independently, but glass, ammonium sulfate, and other affiliated companies cannot be independent. With the current organization, overall benefits can be obtained, etc. Therefore, the future situation will become a considerable political problem. (19th, Telecommunication)</p>

<p>(Berlin) Dr. Schacht, President of the Deutsche Bank, stated in the central committee of the bank today that Germany will only pay 30% of the interest due on long-term foreign debt in cash in the next six months, instead of the 50% paid in the past six months. The remaining 70% will be paid with Deutsche Bank Mark certificates. Subsequently, the bank issued a public statement explaining the necessity of reducing cash payments, stating that although trade has recently been in surplus, the value of exports is not entirely paid in foreign currency, but is paid with Deutsche Bank Mark certificates and German debt instruments, resulting in insufficient foreign currency to pay the large amount of interest due. However, the Dawes and Young loans are not subject to this rule, and the repayment of private debts will also be regulated separately. (18th, National Press)</p>
<p>(London) British government officials and financial leaders have publicly expressed dissatisfaction today with Germany's reduction of cash payments for interest on foreign debts, and the situation is quite serious. It is expected that protests will be lodged with Berlin through diplomatic channels. The British government has begun to contact British bankers and representatives of German creditors in order to determine what action to take. It is understood that British Ambassador to Germany, Sir Eric Phipps, will convey the British government's protest to the German government upon his return to Berlin. Sir Eric attended a meeting of the British Cabinet Disarmament Committee today and was ordered to convey Britain's recent disarmament proposals to German Chancellor Hitler. (19th, National Press)</p>
<p>(London) Today's newspapers severely criticized France's incomplete fulfillment of its debt obligations, stating that Germany's difficulties are undeniable. Germany tried its best to maintain its credit in July, but that is not the case now. It wants to pay debts denominated in foreign currency with new Marks and use the unpaid balance to promote German exports. This principle is very dangerous. Germany used to have a reputation as an honest debtor, but now its reputation has been ruined. Furthermore, it pays all debts to Switzerland and the Netherlands due to their import concessions, and this kind of discriminatory treatment is especially unacceptable. Since June 30, the German National Bank's reserves have increased from 13 million pounds to 20 million pounds, and at the same time, Germany's monthly trade balance has gradually improved. This fact should give people hope that interest will increase and debts will not be defaulted. Germans replied that the average monthly trade balance is only 60 million Marks, while the amount to be paid is more than 100 million Marks. Brokers at the London Stock Exchange have asked their board to prohibit German municipal authorities that do not fulfill their debt obligations from buying low-value German government bonds on the London market.

He also said that the Treasury Department bought 1.6 million yuan worth of government bonds last week, and since October 21, the price of gold has increased by 16 percent and prices have increased by 5.5 percent. (18th, Reuters) (Chicago) Professor Allen, a well-known Chicago economist, claimed that although industry and commerce have made some progress in the past year, they are still 35 to 40 percent lower than usual. The price of ordinary industrial shares, calculated in devalued gold yuan, has risen by 65 percent, but calculated in gold coins, it has only risen by 6 percent, so it is still 35 percent lower than in 1926. In his opinion, given the weakness of world prices, there is no room for optimism. The prospects for 1934 largely depend on whether the US President's plan is sound and has healing power. It is wise for the US President to refuse to reset the price of the gold yuan at this time. (18th, National Press)</p>

<p>(Paris) French Finance Minister Bonnet declared during a Senate debate on the finance bill today, "We will oppose inflation and will not change." (19th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Paris) It is now generally understood that the French government must soon raise 20 billion francs in debt to meet its 1934 debt obligations. However, the success of this debt depends on the balance of the budget. The finance bill is currently being debated in the parliament, but it will pass anyway. The Senate has decided to debate the bill for three days, and today is the second day. It is expected that it will be approved at the end of this week in the same wording as the House of Representatives has already passed. Although the rapporteur mentioned the emptiness of the treasury, the reappearance of floating debt, and the increase in public debt, Finance Minister Bonnet declared today that the situation is not as dangerous as it is rumored. The government is determined to restore national finances and avoid inflation. Regarding the debt-raising proposal, it is worth noting that the banknotes and cash stored by the French people are worth about 30 billion francs. (19th, Reuters)</p>

<p>Claims to be willing to sacrifice himself to protect the party's reputation</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Various Japanese fascist groups deeply resent the Saito cabinet as a puppet of the financial groups and have been holding meetings for days to overthrow the cabinet and promote fascist dictatorship. They are vigorously inciting the poor to riot at the end of the year and have decided to gather farmers from various places in the name of petitioning during the National Assembly meeting in January, surround the National Assembly, and implement a fascist revolution. Among the members of the National League, there is no shortage of those who respond to this group. The Seiyukai and Minseito parties are very worried, and their leaders are secretly traveling frequently to discuss ways to cooperate and deal with the situation. It has been decided to determine the time for a joint celebration of the leaders of the two parties and the method of cooperation in one or two months. For the sake of upholding the ruling power of the financial groups, the two parties have decided to clean up military discipline and oppose military interference in politics as an important political program for their cooperation. (19th, China United Press) (Tokyo) Shiotsuki Gaku, a Seiyukai member elected from Oita Prefecture, who was implicated in the Tokyo City Scandal and was accused in the case, announced his defection from the Seiyukai today. He also stated that the reputation of Japanese political parties has fallen to the ground. He himself is now suspected by the world because of his implication in the Tokyo City Scandal, so he will preemptively defect from the political party to thank the people of the country before the court makes a judgment on right and wrong. This move is believed to be able to restore the people's trust in political parties. There are still eleven people in the Seiyukai, including former Railways Minister Ogawa, Nakajima, Suzuki, and Idoi, who are implicated in the embezzlement case. Shiotsuki's defection has given them an important hint and has attracted attention from all walks of life. (11th, China United Press)</p>
<h3 id="e61">Japanese Cabinet Meeting: Ministers Engage in Heated Debate; Difficult to Implement Rural Policies <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) At 1:30 PM today, the Japanese cabinet convened an internal affairs meeting. Prime Minister Saito originally planned to conclude today, but due to the many disputes, nothing was gained. The ministers' views on the principles of saving agriculture are not far apart, but their specific proposals differ too much. Agriculture Minister Goto raised the issue of rural joint organizations, fertilizer countermeasures, rural land rights, protection of tenant farmers, and additional budgets. Regarding the rural joint organization plan, Commerce Minister Nakajima, representing the views of the financial groups, opposed expanding industrial organizations and eliminating small and medium-sized businesses and industries. Fertilizer countermeasures will be handled by the agricultural and commercial authorities to formulate specific measures. Because the land issue harms the interests of the landlord class, the two ministers, Mitsuchi and Takahashi, strongly opposed it, and the budget issue was not raised. It is reported that Army Minister Araki raised a major incident in Manchuria in the meeting and reported the truth of the matter. Regarding the SMR reorganization plan, Army Minister Araki also criticized Colonial Affairs Minister Nagai in person. Colonial Affairs Minister Nagai said that he did not make a statement, but that his conversation was mistakenly reported as a statement. The heated debate lasted for three and a half hours before the meeting adjourned. It is expected that it will be difficult to conclude by the end of the year. (19th, China United Press)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Song Xishang said that more than 70 breaches of the Yellow River had been blocked one after another, but the breach at Shitou Village was difficult to block. The breach required approximately 1 million yuan and 8,000 cubic meters of stone. He asked the Ministry of Railways to transport the stone free of charge and hire ferry craftsmen to drive piles. It could be completed by next spring. Song will return to Kaifeng on the 23rd. (19th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Li Shutian said that although there are many hydrological records of rivers in North China, they are still insufficient for reference and must be continuously surveyed. Currently, there are about 20 hydrological stations, about 40 water level stations, and about 80 rain gauge stations, distributed in the Jinan, Kaifeng, Taiyuan, and Chengde areas. The fundamental plan for the governance of the Yongding River is to divert the turbid current to Beihai and dredge Qinglong Bay, which will cost approximately 34 million yuan. If the Yongding River is not governed, the silt in the Hai River will not be removed, and the port of Tianjin will not be improved. The most important project now requires approximately 5 million yuan, which has been submitted by the Water Conservancy Association to the central government for allocation from cotton and wheat loans for implementation.

Feng said that the blocking of the breach at Shitou Village could be completed this winter, but the construction was difficult due to lack of funds. Formal construction had not yet begun. Permeable dams and water diversion dams were being built, and the 500,000 yuan construction fund might not be enough. Only 170,000 yuan had been allocated, and only 1,000 cubic meters of stone had been transported. He brought five proposals: 1. The Taihang Dam at the border of Hebei and Henan should be repaired by the government, 2. The Lao'an Dam in Hua County should be repaired by the government, 3. Add river police, 4. Raise the dikes, 5. Add water volume reports to the hydrological station in Shaanzhou. The riverbed of the Dacheji River in Changyuan is higher than the river dike and the dike is being raised. (19th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Chen Ruzhen said that the Henan breach blocking project could be completed within three days. However, all of the Yellow River water from the name of the village has flowed from the breach, and cars can now pass through the old riverbed. The conference will open on the 20th to review the proposals. On the 21st, five proposals from Henan will be discussed: 1. Establish material factories along the river, 2. Ask the Yellow River Conservancy Commission to release silt along the river to prevent flooding and benefit the people's livelihood, 3. Ask the Commission to set up a hydraulic experiment field along the river, 4. Ask the Commission to measure the Yellow River downstream of Henan Province, 5. Continue to determine the border area between Hebei, Pingyuan, and Henan for river defense to facilitate river defense. In addition, Hebei, Shandong, and Henan will jointly ask the governments of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, and Anhui to forward a request to the central government to allocate a large sum of money to repair the Yellow River post-disaster project to prevent breaches next year, because next year will be more dangerous than this year.

<p>(Nanjing) According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the international judicial institutions in The Hague originally included two types: the Permanent Court of Arbitration and the Permanent Court of International Justice. The former is based on the Hague Convention of 1899 and 1907, while the latter is based on the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice, unanimously adopted by the League of Nations General Assembly on December 13, 1920. Wang Chonghui has served as the Chinese arbitrator of the Court of Arbitration since 1921, and was elected as a judge of the Permanent Court of International Justice after September 1930, assuming office in April 1931. These are two separate matters. Recently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a report from the Chinese envoy stationed in the Netherlands stating that Wang's term as arbitrator expired on November 26 of last year and can be renewed according to Article 44 of the Second Hague Convention. This was forwarded to the Executive Yuan for reappointment. As for Wang's position as a judge of the Permanent Court of International Justice, his term should be nine years according to Article 13 of the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice.

According to a telegram from Dutch engineer Alma, he will depart from the Netherlands in mid-January of next year and arrive in Shanghai on February 14. The Municipal Government will convene a board meeting in February to pre-plan the design and construction of Beijing's water conservancy projects to be fully completed within the two-year term of the Dutch engineer.

<h3 id="e103">Trotsky of Russia Discusses Japan's Impending Suicide 丨Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Entrusts Matsuoka to Write a Rebuttal丨 <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>On the 14th of this month, the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun reprinted an article from the famous American magazine "Records" in which Russian Trotsky vehemently attacked Japan. Entitled "Is Japan Really Committing Suicide?" The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs entrusted Yosuke Matsuoka to write a rebuttal. The following is a summary of the main points of Trotsky and Madame Drummond-Hay's views on the Russo-Japanese War.</p>
<p>Madame Drummond-Hay recently published an article in the Hearst News Service in the United States, titled "Views on the Russo-Japanese War," predicting that Japan will inevitably fight Russia and the United States. This kind of rumor is also heard among Russians, who fear that Japan's emerging power will extend its strategic hand into Russia. Russia will inevitably lose its gateway to the Far East, Vladivostok, and the coastal region. Trotsky, on the other hand, said that after the World War, a great tragedy in human history is about to occur in Japan. The Japanese often boast of never losing a war. People believe that this belief has little to do with Japan's economy and society, but they do not know that Japan's ruling class is even more powerful than before. Therefore, the internal trends of these people have all turned to aggressive foreign issues. Regarding the recent request to Russia to recognize "Manchukuo," they regard international treaties as waste paper and ignore the investigation by the League of Nations. On the one hand, they hope that the United States will adhere to a policy of non-interference, and on the other hand, they want Russia to make major concessions, allowing Japan to act freely. As a result, Japan not only has ambitions to dominate Asia, but even wants to dominate the entire world. This is a fantasy held by the Japanese. However, the occurrence of this fantasy, observed from past facts, is like the Japanese defeating China in a war forty years ago, and driving Russia out of Manchuria thirty years ago. These are past facts, but in today's terms, they are already process fantasies. Therefore, modern Japan's desire to defeat Russia or other first-class countries may not be easy. First, a long-term war requires a calculation of success in economic warfare. Today's Japanese military personnel cannot be compared with the United States and Russia in terms of modern scientific knowledge. The final decision of Japan's great invasion is made by the military leaders, but are they miscalculating the war plans of the world's number one land power? The Japanese boast of never losing a war because they over-believe in the myths of past victories, or only compare themselves with countries that are lagging behind the times. The relative evaluation of victory depends entirely on the facts. Moreover, those who defeated Russia in the past cannot be compared with today. Seven years after the Russo-Japanese War, the Russian army has been greatly reformed, and Japan often assumes that Russia and the United States are hypothetical enemy countries. However, Japan's economy is weak, and its domestic factories want to continue the war for several years, and its ability to supply the necessary supplies to the battlefield is very weak. Other economic organizations are heavily burdened by the military in peacetime, and they also lack experience in modern science and modern tactics. Madame Drummond-Hay commented, "Today, Russia's only method of attacking Japan is the air force. The distance between the coastal region and Japan is only 350 nautical miles, and the maximum distance is no more than 750 nautical miles. If Vladivostok is equipped with long-range aircraft with four motors to attack Japan, it can achieve the purpose of attack, but the air force cannot completely return. Because Japan has fully defended against the development of the Chinese and Russian air forces, Japan's aviation is still in its infancy. At present, Russia's air force expansion is mainly based on building and equipping four to five large bombers, while Japan specializes in building aircraft, artillery, and fighter jets that are mainly defensive. What will be the result if a war breaks out between Japan and Russia? From a strategic point of view, Japan is not necessarily at a disadvantage. Because Japan's air force has an advantage over the Russian air force, that is, its defense area is small, and aircraft manufacturing plants are all close to the base. Russia does not have complete manufacturing and repair factories near the base. For example, if Vladivostok is attacked by the Japanese air force, or the Siberian railway is blocked, it will not be easy to organize. A few days ago, Russia announced its air force expansion plan. Many people did not believe it, but in today's world, it cannot be disbelieved. Fifteen years ago, when the European War broke out, Germany had only 280 aircraft. By 1918, when the armistice treaty was signed, there were 5,000 aircraft on the front line, 9,000 aircraft in the rear, and 5,500 aircraft unfinished in the factory. Moreover, with the development of modern aviation industry, Russia's expansion of the air force should not be underestimated."</p>
<h3 id="e104">Shantou's Financial Circles Still in Panic <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The Appeasement Headquarters Issues a Proclamation to Maintain Paper Money</p>
<p>The Market's Current Funds Are Extremely Exhausted</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Shantou's various private banks issued approximately 3 million yuan in paper money, of which approximately 1 million yuan has already collapsed. In addition, 58 private banks issued blank notes, totaling 1.55 million yuan. Currently, five banks have collapsed, with a total of 219,000 yuan in blank notes. The City Chamber of Commerce, in response to the collapse of various private banks and the people's years of hardship, telegraphed the Provincial Government, requesting a temporary suspension of the collection of various taxes, and submitted a report to the Eastern District Appeasement Headquarters, requesting relief. The Headquarters has now issued a proclamation to the people, stating that from now on, they must not refuse to use the collapsed paper money and blank notes. The original text is as follows: "Yesterday, Chairman Zheng Lingxing of the City Chamber of Commerce reported that Guangfa, Zhifa, Hongfasheng, Qianchangxing and other private banks simultaneously declared bankruptcy today, and a major panic suddenly arose in the city's financial circles. In order to maintain the market, the Association immediately convened an emergency executive committee meeting, which resolved three measures regarding maintaining the market's finances: 1. The guaranteed paper money and guaranteed blank notes issued by various firms and banks throughout the city are, in fact, secured by industry and can fundamentally be worry-free. They should all be used as usual to maintain the market. From today onwards, it is resolved not to redeem them within these four months. 2. Regardless of what kind of bank or private bank, those with due dates for withdrawal from today onwards will all have their bills extended for 60 days, with a daily interest rate of 2.5 cents per thousand yuan for private banks and 3 cents for other banks. This is to maintain the overall situation in the city. If there is intentional collection and return, it will be regarded as damaging finance. In addition to requesting official punishment, each household will also be fined 500 yuan in silver dollars. 3. For deposits made by wealthy households, whether they are in banks or private banks, if they want to withdraw them, from today onwards, they will only be allowed to withdraw 10% of the amount deposited each month. Transactions between private banks and banks will still be carried out as usual. Regarding Guangfa, Zhifa, Hongfasheng, etc., the resolutions for the guaranteed blank notes and guaranteed paper money are as follows: Guangfa Bank issued 110,000 yuan in guaranteed paper money and 50,000 yuan in guaranteed blank notes; Zhifa Bank issued 100,000 yuan in guaranteed paper money and 36,500 yuan in guaranteed blank notes; Hongfasheng Bank issued 50,000 yuan in guaranteed paper money. All of these are secured by local industries and can fundamentally be worry-free. However, once this huge amount of money stagnates, it will have a significant impact on the market. It is agreed that the Association will be responsible for stamping the paper money and blank notes issued by the above three banks with the City of Shantou Chamber of Commerce circulation stamp. During these four months, they will be used as usual and must not be rejected. Violators will be investigated by the authorities. The above two items are all measures to maintain the market's finances and should be reported to the authorities for record and announced to the public. In addition to submitting a separate report, a list of the Guangfa Bank's etc. guaranteed industries is attached for your review. Upon investigation, the various items presented by the Chairman are for the purpose of maintaining the market's finances and are, of course, feasible. Since the Guangfa Bank's etc. guaranteed paper money and blank notes are secured by local industries, the public can be worry-free. In addition to instructing that this matter be recorded, it is hereby proclaimed to merchants and residents for their information."</p>
<p>Currently, Shantou's established private banks are all strictly controlling lending. The Bank of China, the Postal Bureau, and other institutions have suspended receiving deposits and savings, because the majority of the money received consists of paper money and blank notes. The various tax bureaus all require the collection of silver dollars and cash. Established wealthy families are secretly buying Hong Kong dollars for storage, so the price of Hong Kong dollars is particularly high, with a premium of 230 yuan per thousand yuan. Shanghai drafts are also high, with a premium of 89 yuan per hundred yuan. This is a sign that the people are unwilling to hold paper money. With the exchange rate so high, there are more and more people smuggling cash out of the country. The exhaustion of cash in the market is unprecedented since Shantou was established. (13th)</p>
<h3 id="e105">The People of Northern Sichuan Are Forming Volunteer Corps <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Hardships Suffered by the People of Yingshan Disrupted by Banditry, as Described by Refugees</p>
<p>Peng'an Correspondence: Whenever the Red Bandits arrive at a place, they completely concentrate all the grain and cash in that place, and order the people of that place to organize various teams to serve them. Women with even a little beauty are almost all raped by the bandits, and are forced to organize comfort teams for the bandit army to insult at will. Therefore, the people all resent them to the bone. In recent days, the five-route bandit suppression army has been fiercely attacking the bandits who claimed allegiance to the Soviets, inflicting heavy losses on the bandits. Therefore, the people in various places have risen up and organized volunteer corps to jointly assist the government army in suppressing the bandits. It is estimated that those that have been organized and established include various counties such as Shunqing, Peng'an, Yingshan, Yilong, Nanbu, and Quxian. Even the people of Tongnanba, who have fallen into the bandit area, have all risen up upon hearing the news. These teams are extremely good at fighting, and they know the tactics of the Red Bandits very well. Recently, they sent people to contact Yang Sen and Li Qixiang to request assistance and have established contact. There are also many defectors from the bandit army, and the momentum is very large. The Red Bandits, seeing this situation, are very panicked, and the people's hearts are shaking. The situation is extremely chaotic. Although Yingshan has now been recovered, it was destroyed and is beyond repair after being captured by the bandits. Recently, someone escaped here and described the situation in Yingshan as follows:</p>
<p>After Yingshan City was captured by the communist bandits, He Wei, the commander of the pseudo-Ninth Army, was stationed there and set up a Likin Tax Committee. The opium and pork tax was 30%, and there was no fixed tax amount for other products. The people were ordered to make a pair of shoes for each household. Those who could not make them had to buy a pair of thread-eared straw sandals as comfort items for the officers and soldiers of the pseudo-army. Local people who were identified as wealthy were immediately taken to the political department for punishment and forced to hand over their money. Those who could not hand over the money were executed. When the bandits retreated, they detained more than 500 men, women, old and young. Many died along the way, and the rest were detained in the political department.</p>
<p>After the communist bandits came to the city, no one who had not escaped was tied up. The bandits searched for grain and rice in the residents' homes, taking whatever they could eat or wear. The people could only cry to the heavens and pray to the gods. When we (the gentleman referred to himself) went out to walk, we had to get a road pass. If two or three people were chatting together, they would say that they were reactionaries and arbitrarily arrest and whip them. Families were not allowed to gather in one place. At 6:00 PM in the evening, the lights had to be turned off. If it was a little late, they would say that there was trackless behavior. If there were missing slogans on the street, they would say that we tore them down, restricting freedom more than being a slave of a vanquished country.</p>
<p>The bandits set up five villages in the city, one each in the southwest, northeast, and one in the People's Bookstore opposite the county government, with 150 households in each village. Each village had a chairman who was responsible for searching the people for everything, including food items, oil, salt, firewood, rice, sauce, and vinegar. The people were exhausted all day long, unable to eat when hungry and unable to wear warm clothes when cold. If anyone spoke or expressed pain, they would be detained and punished. It was a great catastrophe for our family." (Guowen News Agency, December 10)</p>
<h3 id="e106">Shandong Province Grain Prices Plunge - Many Grain Merchants Experience Slow Business and Close Down ### <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Recently, various industries in Shandong have been in a slump, almost reaching their lowest point. The drastic fall in grain prices is also unprecedented. For example, wheat, which was worth five or six yuan per hundred catties last year, is now only selling for three yuan. Sorghum, which was around four yuan last year, is now at two yuan and ten cents. Peanuts, which were seven yuan last year, are now at three yuan, fifty or sixty cents. Other grains have experienced similar declines. As a result, grain merchants in Jinan City are facing deserted storefronts with no business to be done. It is said that during the years of the Republic of China from 1927 to 1929, there were as many as 128 grain stores in Jinan City, marking a golden age. Afterwards, they gradually closed down, and this year, the number has decreased to around twenty. Many of them are also engaged in other businesses, such as coal stores, in order to survive. In reality, there are only a little more than ten left, including Tong Ju He, De Xing He, Heng Ju Cheng Yu Lai, Tong Ju Chang, Xie Tai Fu Xing Shun, and Fu Tong Ju Dong Xin Cheng Dong Fu Cheng Yong. It is said that the current situation is that while there are people selling grain, there are very few buyers. Although the price has been reduced, it still does not help the situation. The result of the grain price plunge is that cheap grain hurts farmers. Ignoring the surface, one might assume it is due to a good harvest in rural areas, overproduction, and supply exceeding demand; or that the transportation is not smooth and sales are stagnant. However, the actual situation now is the opposite. According to a survey by the Grain Industry Association, the agricultural production of various counties this year is not abundant and is only about 70% to 80% of a normal year, barely enough to sustain themselves. Furthermore, comparing the situation with previous years, before the three northeastern provinces were occupied by Japan, a large amount of sorghum was imported into Shandong from Qingdao and Yangjiaogou every year. In addition, Hebei in the north and Jiangsu in the south also gradually imported grain. At that time, not only did grain prices not fall, but there was no concern about unsalable goods. Now, since the loss of the three northeastern provinces, the steady stream of imports has disappeared. The actual amount of grain in the province has not only not increased compared to before, but has decreased, resulting in the current situation of cheap grain hurting farmers, which is quite strange.

<p>Anqing Dispatch: The Anqing Military Police Joint Inspection Office received a tip-off on the 2nd of this month that Wu Xingfa, a resident of 52 Dong Street outside the Small South Gate of the provincial capital, was manufacturing "red pills" every night and transporting them to various towns and villages for sale. It was reported that ten pieces of goods had arrived from Shanghai a few days ago, and two pieces had already been sent across the river for transshipment one evening. The Inspection Director Dong Ziming and Inspector Bo Donghui were dispatched to the address with the local patrol officers to search the premises. They arrested the main offender Wu Xingfa, accomplices Ji Guoyuan, Wu He Shi, and Hu Xiaoyi, and seized several pieces of narcotics. The suspects and drugs were taken back to the office, and after interrogation by Director Li Yimin, the suspects confessed to manufacturing "red pills." Subsequently, the suspects were sent to the Anqing Garrison Headquarters, where, after clear interrogation, except for Wu He Shi and Hu Xiaoyi, whose involvement was considered minor and were sentenced to imprisonment and detention respectively and sent to prison for execution, and after notifying various agencies by letter and publicly burning the narcotics, the death penalty was imposed in accordance with the instructions of the Yuzhouwan Three-Province Bandit Suppression Headquarters, attached to the Puyuanzi No. 51, and Article 57, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. After the approval of the provincial government, the main offenders Wu Xingfa and Ji Guoyuan were identified and taken to the execution ground outside the Small East Gate yesterday (the 13th) at 4:00 PM and executed by firing squad as a warning. Wu Xingfa was from Huaining, 42 years old, and Ji Guoyuan was from Shanghai, 28 years old. (December 14th)</p>

<h3 id="e110">Changshu - Meeting to Reduce Local Budget <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government, to carefully reduce local surtaxes, has formed a review committee. The committee will thoroughly review the budgets submitted by various counties and order the county government to convene various agencies and local gentry to discuss budget reductions and surtax cuts. The county government held a meeting at the county government on the afternoon of the 18th of this month. After several hours of discussion, five important items were resolved. 1. The county's land tax surcharge is 4 jiao 7 fen 8 li per mu. Due to the sharp decline in production and low rice prices, this surcharge will be reduced by 1 jiao across the board. All surcharge names will be abolished, and the unified tax will be the county tax per mu. 2. The land survey fee is collected at 1 jiao per mu, with a term of three years. This year will be the last year. Currently, the people are suffering and cannot afford the burden. The land survey fee has been collected for two years, and a certain amount has been accumulated, enough to cover the start-up costs. The provincial department will be requested to postpone the collection for the time being until the land survey is actually carried out, and then it will be collected again. 3. Currently, rice prices have plummeted and land prices are falling. The highest land price is less than 50 yuan per mu, and no one is interested in buying it. However, the land price set by the County Land Bureau is 125 yuan per mu, which is too different from the market price. This has resulted in a distorted land tax structure, which has invisibly increased the burden on the people. The county should convene an assessment committee as soon as possible, and conduct a thorough investigation of the actual market price of the land and re-estimate it.</p>

<p>Xiang'an has always been a place for the sale of Huainan salt licenses, with a fixed quota of 120 tickets per year for rotation, so as to supplement the insufficiency of sail transport. Since the Yunshi Mu promoted rotation transport last year, the amount of rotation transport tickets at the port has been gradually increased year by year. It is estimated that 168 tickets should be handled this year, of which about 140 tickets are allocated to Jinan for sale and about 20 tickets are allocated to the three Huai Bei yards for sale. Although the salt from the three Huai Bei yards was transported in May and June, it was purely new production this year, with a higher moisture content, resulting in the discovery of thousands of bags of wet salt upon arrival. The port merchants secretly lamented their losses, and the users complained. The Jinan yard salt was shipped from August to the end of last month, and all of it has been shipped. It is reported that the inspection in Hunan showed that the color was white and clean, and the bags were dry, which was welcomed by the Hunan side.</p>

<p>The location where the Yuji ran aground is near the Donggua Island Lighthouse off the coast of Wenzhou, about three hours by sea from Wenzhou. According to those familiar with the Shanghai-Fuzhou route, there are three routes through Zhejiang Ocean: outer, middle, and inner circles. Donggua Island is within the inner route circle, where there are many hidden reefs. According to people in the company, the Yuji's accident was probably caused by wind and waves, but the shipowner's telegram did not mention it. The company received a further telegram from the Yuji yesterday, stating that the first and second cabins were completely submerged, and the ship had become front-heavy and rear-light. In addition, due to the impact of the waves, the front of the ship was also grounded on the reef.

<p>More than a hundred passengers gathered in the rear cabin after the accident to await rescue. Later, after receiving a telegram from Shanghai that Huadefeng Tugboat had been dispatched to rescue them, the passengers waited on the ship. The Jiangyuan and Chuguan warships sent by the Naval Department of Sandu came to the ship to protect them. However, by the afternoon, the hull of the Yuji gradually tilted, and the passengers on board were greatly panicked, fearing an accident. They asked the shipowner to consult with the Jiangyuan warship of the Navy to first transfer the passengers to the warship and send them to Shanghai. After the captain of the Jiangyuan warship agreed, they released a sampan for transfer and rescued all of them onto the warship that night.</p>

<p>The person in charge of the Yuda Company said that the rescue plan for the Yuji is currently under negotiation. Yesterday, the company sent two telegrams to the Yuji shipowner, asking in detail about the extent of the damage to the ship and how to rescue it most effectively, whether to send a large ship to tow it, or to send a barge to unload the cargo first. After the reply, the method will be determined. The Lianbao Insurance Company, because it insured the ship for 120,000 yuan for peace insurance, advocated sending a ship to rescue the Yuji after it ran aground. It has contacted the company many times yesterday and has also decided to wait for the reply telegram to determine the rescue method, such as sending a ship to salvage it or sending personnel to inspect it.</p>

The cargo inside the ship consisted entirely of oranges and olives, which were not affected by the water, but there were fears of decay over time and difficulties with unloading. The total value of the cargo was estimated to be over 100,000 yuan, and together with the "Yuji" ship itself, as well as the luggage of passengers and crew, the total loss was at least 300,000 yuan or more.</p>

<p>American wheat arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and unloading began yesterday, which is expected to take four days to complete. The ship will then be returned to Baohe Company. The second batch, after arriving in Shanghai, is planned to load American goods for export. American cotton has also recently arrived in force, as detailed below.</p>
<h3 id="e143">First Batch Exclusively Purchased by Fufeng <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The first shipment of American wheat, 8,940 tons transported by the "Arie Flaebank," was exclusively purchased by the Fufeng Flour Mill in Shanghai. The Fuxin Mill did not receive any. Therefore, after the ship arrived in Shanghai and underwent routine inspection, unloading began yesterday morning. Fufeng sent barges to Wharf No. 4 to receive the cargo, which was then barged to Suzhou Creek and stored in the mill's own warehouses, exempt from import duties. This has been approved by the Ministry of Finance, making the purchase of American wheat even cheaper than ordering directly from the United States. After this batch of cargo is unloaded, the ship will be returned to Baohe, as it needs to be sent to Little Luzon to transport goods to Mumbai, India. Therefore, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will not continue to lease this ship.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Next Shipment to Carry Goods for Export <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has secured over 5,000 tons of American goods for export. However, since the first ship was scheduled to return immediately after arriving in Shanghai, the large shipment of goods destined for the United States will be transported on the second ship carrying wheat to Shanghai. The second batch of wheat, 8,000 tons, is expected to arrive within this week, and two more batches, totaling 12,700 tons, are expected to arrive in another ten days. In total, 32,213 tons can be transported within these two weeks, worth approximately 2.3 million yuan in national currency.</p>

<p>Imports of American cotton have also recently arrived in large quantities. In addition to the 5,500 bales transported by the Yitai Foreign Firm's "Chevrolet" ship, other British and American ships have transported varying amounts of one to two thousand bales each. The Fulai Foreign Firm has also loaded two ships, including the "Delating," each carrying four to five thousand bales. These are being unloaded at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's North Wharf and China Wharf. An additional 10,000 bales of American cotton destined for Shanghai in January are currently en route.</p>

<p>Flour mills in various locations have recently heard that importing American wheat with loans is exempt from tariffs, and the cost is lower than buying directly from abroad. Therefore, in recent days, Tianjin, Hankou, Ningbo, and other places have been inquiring about wheat prices and negotiating purchase matters with the American Wheat Management Office. From next month onwards, shipments to China will increase, with at least 40,000 tons imported each month.</p>

<p>Regarding native tobacco leaves that have already paid the special tax and are transported for sale abroad and in non-special tax areas, merchants should, according to regulations, submit all required evidence to the original special tax collection agency to request a tax refund. The Ministry of Finance has revised and supplemented the tax refund method and has specifically instructed the Tax Bureau and all native tobacco tax bureaus to comply. The original text is transcribed below:</p>

<p>For native tobacco leaves exported from Shanghai to foreign countries and non-special tax areas, merchants should be allowed to collect all necessary evidence after reporting the export and submit it to the Ministry of Finance's Tax Bureau for verification and tax refund. For those reporting transportation to other ports or foreign and non-special tax areas, merchants should be allowed to submit evidence directly to the agency that originally approved the transportation for export to request a tax refund. Those holding original tax payment certificates at the border of a special tax area and reporting transportation for sale in a non-special tax area should still request a tax refund directly from the original special tax collection agency.

<p>The tax bureau should calculate the amount of tax to be refunded according to regulations, fill out a tax refund certificate, and have the merchant find a shop guarantor. The tax bureau will then issue the refund in full and send the original evidence and tax refund certificate to the provincial bureau or special tobacco tax office that originally collected the special tax, as well as the consolidated tax management office that also handles tobacco taxes, instructing them to return the amount of the advance tax refund to the Tax Bureau for reimbursement. After receiving the merchant's receipt and tax refund certificate issued by the Tax Bureau, the provincial bureau, special tobacco tax office, and consolidated tax management office that also handle tobacco taxes should then submit a request to the Tax Bureau to offset the tax amount in accordance with the tax offset method listed in Article 3. When provincial stamp tax bureaus for tobacco and alcohol, special tobacco tax offices, and consolidated tax management offices that also handle tobacco taxes encounter merchants submitting evidence when reporting the direct transportation or transportation of native tobacco leaves to foreign countries and non-special tax areas</p>
<h3 id="e150">Submit Evidence <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>When requesting a tax refund, if the evidence is verified to be true and a tax refund should be granted, the amount of tax to be refunded should be calculated according to regulations, a tax refund certificate should be filled out, and the merchant should provide a shop guarantee. The refund should be issued in full from the collected tax funds. After obtaining the merchant's receipt, a tax offset form should be filled out, and the original receipt and tax refund certificate should be submitted to the Tax Bureau to offset the tax amount. When tobacco and alcohol tax sub-bureaus and special tobacco tax sub-bureaus encounter merchants submitting evidence when reporting the direct transportation of native tobacco leaves to non-special tax areas and requesting a tax refund, they should immediately verify that the documents match and then submit the original documents to the provincial stamp tax bureau for tobacco and alcohol or the special tobacco tax office, and the consolidated tax management office that also handles tobacco taxes for review. A tax refund certificate should be filled out according to regulations and issued to the merchant through the sub-bureau.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Find a Shop Guarantee <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The refund should be issued in full from the collected tax funds.

The first event, the national goods car parade, will be organized and prepared by the China National Goods Production and Sales Cooperation Association, the Mechanical National Goods Factory Federation, the National Goods Federation, the Shanghai Citizens' National Goods Promotion Association, and the National Goods Maintenance Association. Ladies and gentlemen who are enthusiastic about promoting national goods will be invited to participate at that time.

<p>According to Shenshi News Agency, the Municipal Government's new building in the city center and the temporary houses for various bureaus have been completed for some time. The Municipal Government has decided to operate from the new building on New Year's Day. The affiliated bureaus have begun to relocate successively from today. At the same time, the design drawings for the two major buildings, the library and the museum, in the central area have been drafted and are scheduled to be completed within two years. The details are divided as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e155">Relocation Dates of Municipal Government Bureaus <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>After the Municipal Government meeting decided that the period from the 15th to the 31st of this month would be the relocation date for the Municipal Government and various bureaus, each bureau immediately actively prepared everything. After deliberation, the deadline for the relocation of each bureau was decided as follows: 1. Social Affairs Bureau on the 20th, 2. Secretariat on the 25th, 3. Health Bureau on the 25th, 4. Education Bureau on the 26th, 5. Public Works Bureau on the 26th, 6. Land Bureau on the 24th, 7. Finance and Public Utilities Bureaus to postpone relocation.

<h3 id="e156">Temporary No Central District Management Office <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of establishing an office in Hu Nan after the relocation of the Municipal Government, Municipal Government Secretary-General Yu told a reporter from Shenshi News Agency yesterday that there is no formal decision to establish an office yet, and it will be submitted to the Municipal Government meeting for discussion in the coming days. As for the establishment of a Central District Management Office, there is currently no such need, as various municipal works in the central district can be handled separately by the competent bureaus. If there is such a need after the development of the business in the future, it will be set up again.</p>
<p>Building Libraries and Museums</p>
<p>Mr. Yu continued to talk about the establishment of a committee to build large-scale libraries and museums and other cultural auxiliary institutions in the central area of the city, which is actively underway. The Municipal Government pays great attention to this, because this cultural equipment is very important for the citizens' knowledge and cultivation. The Municipal Government has now decided to promote its realization within two years. The architectural drawings have already been drafted, and the funding has been determined to be 2 million yuan, and the Municipal Finance Bureau has been ordered to be responsible for raising the funds.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Representatives of Qinlian Sugar Merchants Asked the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for Assistance Yesterday <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>The export of native sugar from Qinlian, Guangdong, to Shanghai has been repeatedly identified by the Jianghai Customs as being mixed with foreign sugar, and huge fines have been imposed. Sugar merchants have repeatedly suffered losses, and all have suspended business and transportation. The farmers in more than ten counties in southern Guangdong, who rely on the sugar industry for their livelihood, are also on the verge of unemployment and bankruptcy due to the severance of sales channels. All sectors of Qinlian believe that it is urgently necessary to find a way to maintain it. Therefore, the Beihai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, together with the Hepu County Chamber of Commerce and the Qinlian Sugar Industry Guangyi Hall, sent representative Pang Songhui to the province and Beijing to petition. The situation has been reported in previous newspapers. The representative arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. The Cantonese sugar merchants in Shanghai, Guang'an Hall, specially held a banquet for Representative Pang at the New Asia Hotel to report the facts of the case and the situation of petitioning in the province, and the two sides discussed relief methods and steps. At 1:00 p.m. yesterday, accompanied by sugar merchant Ye Boming and others, Representative Pang went to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to request assistance. Zhang Bofang, director of the business department of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, received him. Representative Pang talked about the detailed process and the four methods of petitioning in this case, and handed over the joint letter from the Qinlian Chambers of Commerce. Mr. Zhang said that the Chamber has repeatedly telegraphed the central ministries and departments to fight for the case of Jianghai Customs fining native sugar. Now it will forward the four items mentioned in the letter to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry for a fair solution as soon as possible. The public letter from the Qinlian Chambers of Commerce to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce is copied as follows: With respect, according to the letter from Qinlian Sugar Industry Guangyi Hall, "We have received a letter from our colleagues Heli, Henghe Long, Guangchang, and Heyi, stating that from July to September of this year, our colleagues shipped native white sugar from Beihai to Shanghai five times. All of them were inspected by the Beihai Customs and confirmed to be pure native sugar, and the transit tax was paid in accordance with the regulations before being released. Unexpectedly, the original shipment was directly transported to Shanghai and was completely detained by the Jianghai Customs Tax Department, claiming that it was mixed with 10% to 20% foreign sugar. A total of 1,560 yuan of ocean money was fined and 1,957 yuan of tax was supplemented. The method used to distinguish native sugar from foreign sugar is without standards and has many errors. Our colleagues have jointly submitted a telegram to argue the case, but it has not been resolved for more than a month. Our colleagues are innocent and have suffered this major loss, forcing them to temporarily suspend business to await relief. We have specially listed the list of fines for each company and ask you to check it and immediately forward it to the Beihai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Qinlian County Chambers of Commerce, and report it to the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance, ordering the Jianghai Customs Tax Department to return the fines in full to show fairness," etc. Beihai is an important port for the export of native sugar in South China. The Beihai Customs is close to the sugar-producing area and has a clear understanding of the composition of native sugar and the difference between it and foreign sugar. Therefore, our colleagues have always reported the native sugar for inspection and release, and there has never been a misunderstanding or difficulty. Now that the original shipment is directly transported to Shanghai, the Jianghai Customs claims that it is mixed with foreign sugar and imposes huge fines, which is obviously abusing its powers to destroy local products. If it is not stopped according to the law, how can farmers and merchants live in peace? We have specially recorded the letter and ask you to forward the report to relieve the suffering of merchants, etc., as approved by the Chamber of Commerce. Since the Jianghai Customs' deduction of native sugar occurred, sugar merchants have stopped transporting, and the losses have been unbearable. The farmers and workers in more than ten counties who rely on the sugar industry for their livelihood are also at risk of unemployment and bankruptcy. Livelihood and security are greatly affected. According to the letter, we should deal with the livelihood of farmers and merchants in more than ten counties. Therefore, we have specially joined the Hepu County Chamber of Commerce to convene public associations such as the sugar industry and all sugar merchants to discuss relief methods. A total of four items were agreed upon: 1. Please ask the Ministry of Finance to correct the Jianghai Customs' erroneous method of inspecting the difference between native sugar and foreign sugar. 2. Please ask the Ministry of Finance to order the Jianghai Customs to release the native sugar of Beihai sugar merchants and return the past fines and supplementary taxes. 3. Please ask the Executive Yuan to order the Ministry of Finance to instruct all customs offices across the country to protect the safety of native sugar imports and exports and not to deliberately make things difficult. 4. Please ask the Central Government to issue an order to exempt native sugar from export and transit taxes and set up export incentives for native sugar. After unanimous adoption, in addition to telegrams and submissions, we have specially recorded the case and handed it to your association, and sent Representative Pang Songhui to present everything in person, please give practical assistance so that this case can be thoroughly resolved as soon as possible. It is not only the luck of the Qinlian sugar industry, but also the luck of the national business."</p>

<p>Our overseas Chinese compatriots in Mexico have been oppressed by the anti-Chinese party in Mexico. There have been 19 batches of returnees one after another. Now there is a 20th batch of seven overseas Chinese compatriots in Mexico who fled to the United States due to the expulsion of the anti-Chinese party. They were sent back by the US authorities and returned home on the Dollar Steamship Company's President Hoover. They arrived in Shanghai at 7:00 a.m. yesterday. Upon learning this, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Executive Yuan sent representative Tan Zhonglu to board the ship to express condolences and give each person a gift. Among the refugees returning home this time, six were from Guangdong, and they still took the original ship to Hong Kong to return to their hometown last night. One was from Shandong and waited in Shanghai for a ship to return to his hometown. The names of the refugees are as follows: Lei Yijun, Wu Yiying (Taishan), Nian Pei, Ye Hongtai (Panyu), Zhu Likang (Nanhai), Su Yuan (Enping), Zhou Hong (Shandong), totaling seven people.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Ministry of Finance Instructs Silver Money Industry to Submit Precious Silver - Deadline of One Month to Hand Over Stocked Precious Silver - Lin Kanghou Talks About the Complete Abolition of Taels in Half a Year <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>According to Shenshi News Agency in this city, the Ministry of Finance decided to abolish taels for yuan in order to thoroughly reform the currency system, stipulating that 7 qian 1 fen 5 li is a fixed conversion rate, which has been implemented since March 10. The Ministry issued a clear order to the two Silver Money Guilds to implement it together, and then prohibited the melting and casting of silver furnaces as a fundamental abolition plan. However, the silver tael system has a long history and is deeply rooted. Once abolished, it will not be easy. The Ministry of Finance yesterday instructed the two Silver Money Guilds to hand over the stocked precious silver within a time limit, which is the final method to fundamentally abolish silver taels. The details are recorded in detail as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e160">Ministry of Finance Orders to Hand Over Precious Silver <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance believes that the power of the two Silver Money Guilds in this city has always been strong. Although it has repeatedly issued clear orders to abolish taels, the fundamental reason why all parties still follow the old system and have not completely abolished it is that the existing silver in stock has not been changed, which is a major obstacle to currency system reform. Now the Ministry of Finance has specially instructed the two Silver Money Guilds to hand over all stocked precious silver to the Central Bank within one month and exchange it for silver dollars in accordance with the stipulated conversion rate. After the deadline, precious silver must no longer be used as a reserve. The Central Mint has separately minted a kind of thousand-yuan silver bar, with one thousand silver dollars per bar, which can be used as a reserve for various banks or money shops, which is very convenient.</p>

<p>Yesterday, a reporter from Shenshi News Agency interviewed Mr. Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the Banking Association, and asked about the effect of the Ministry of Finance's order to abolish taels and change to yuan. According to him, the market has been reformed a lot since the Ministry of Finance ordered the abolition of taels and the change to yuan, and silver taels will no longer be used. Recently, the Ministry of Finance ordered the Silver Money Industry to hand over precious silver within one month and exchange it for silver coins. After that, the inventory is empty and there is no basis, so silver taels will no longer be issued in the market. However, due to various habitual relationships, it may not be completely eliminated temporarily. According to my observation, the goal of completely abolishing taels can definitely be achieved in another six months.</p>

<p>According to Guomin News Agency, the First Hall of the Military and Political Department of the National Government, when Li Jishen was the director, set up a military radio station at No. 11 Bubaifang in the French Concession of this city for the convenience of military communications. Recently, there has been suspicion of private communication with the Min Province. The Central Government ordered the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs to consult the Municipal Government of this city and order the Municipal Public Security Bureau to cooperate with the French Police to seal up the radio station. The Municipal Public Security Bureau has reported the sealing situation to the Municipal Government. Yesterday, the Municipal Government ordered the Municipal Public Security Bureau to send personnel to take over all kinds of radio machinery seized from the station from the French Police. It is heard that the bureau has taken all the above-mentioned machinery back yesterday. The Municipal Government has reported the previous situation to the Central Government.</p>

<p>Shen Jiayi, Deputy Director of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, previously followed the Minister of Justice and Administration, Luo Wengan, from Beijing to Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, and other counties to inspect the courts, prisons, and detention centers. The inspection lasted for many days, and the results were quite satisfactory. Now it is learned that after Deputy Director Shen inspected the Jiangdu Court, he returned to Beijing with Minister Luo to inspect the Jiangning Court and prison. At that time, he did not return to Shanghai. It is also heard that Minister Luo will go to Gaoyou, Yancheng, Qingjiangpu, and other places again tomorrow (21st) to continue to inspect the current situation of justice. His inspection itinerary has also been drawn up by Deputy Director Shen. Therefore, it is still difficult for Deputy Director Shen to return to Shanghai to cancel his leave and take office for the time being. It is expected that he will be able to complete the inspection and return to Shanghai to cancel his leave next week.</p>

<p>It has been nearly a month since Jin Xi was illegally arrested by the French Concession Central Patrol Room in cooperation with the Japanese Consulate General in the French Concession. The family members have presented the Chinese citizenship permit of Jin Yongduo and Jin Xi through representatives Li Shichang and lawyer Xu Jie, and have inquired with the French Concession Central Patrol Room one after another. On the 6th of this month, lawyer Xu Jie and Li Shichang negotiated with the French Consul General's Office, and the French Consul General agreed to notify the Japanese Consul General's Office to send back Jin Xi. Lawyers Xu Jie and Lou Yunmei formally represented the case in writing, requesting the French Consul General's Office to notify the Japanese Consul General's Office to send back the case. The afternoon before yesterday, lawyer Xu Jie visited the French Consul General's Office again and had a long conversation with the French Consul General. According to the French Consul General, the French Consulate General had formally notified the Japanese Consul General in writing a long time ago, but has not yet replied. He will notify Jin Xi's family as soon as he receives a reply.</p>
<p>A special regulation was issued before the test, stipulating that they must report within six months to wait for the test. Unexpectedly, the foreign crew members ignored the Ministry's order and did not take the test. After the deadline, they still worked on the ship. The Shanghai Merchant Ship Driving Association and the Marine Engineering Association submitted a request to the Ministry, requesting the implementation of the crackdown, replacing all these unauthorized foreign crew members and suspending their duties. The Ministry has approved the order and ordered the Shanghai Maritime Administration to strictly implement it. The Maritime Administration has begun to inspect the employment of foreign crew members on national ships entering and leaving the country in compliance with the Ministry's order. If anyone is found without a certificate, the departure form will not be issued and the ship will be prohibited from leaving the country. This time, the captain and mate of the Yu Da ship were foreign nationals and had no certificates. Therefore, the crackdown was implemented, and the ship was prohibited from leaving the country, causing Yu Da to be stranded in Shanghai for two days. As a result, the ship asked a Chinese second mate to come forward and take the place, and submitted an application in accordance with the regulations. The company promised to replace the unauthorized crew members and replace them with qualified personnel before being allowed to leave the country. Recently, the Maritime Administration has been very serious about handling this matter. After this rectification, foreign crew members must be examined and approved by the Ministry's order.</p>

<p>Gu Xin, the head of the petition group of the Flour Mill Industry Association, and others went to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Finance and Customs Administration at 10:00 a.m. yesterday to petition for the exemption of import taxes on foreign wheat that has been ordered. The result was quite satisfactory. At 4:00 p.m., the representatives of various counties continued to hold a meeting at the Fuxin Head Office on Jiangxi Road to report on the progress. The details are divided as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e168">Yesterday's Petition <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>The petition delegation, in accordance with the resolutions of the general meeting, continued their meeting the day before to determine the next steps. At ten o'clock yesterday morning, the delegation mutually selected Gu Xin'yi, Sun Zhongli, Lu Xiaoqing, Li Beitao, Shi Fuhou, and five others to petition the Shanghai office of the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance. The director, Shen Shuyu, received them. After the representatives presented the difficulties faced by manufacturers, they requested that the Ministry of Finance, before implementing the collection of foreign duties, should exempt foreign wheat already ordered from foreign merchants from import duties. Director Shen immediately stated that this office was a Shanghai-based agency of the Ministry of Finance and was not in a position to give an immediate reply. He promised to forward the grievances of the manufacturers to the Ministry of Finance for review and handling, hoping for a patient wait for a solution. The representatives were satisfied and left at half past eleven.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Continued Meeting <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>

<h3 id="e171">Telegram to the National Government <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Respectfully presented to the Nanjing National Government: Since Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and others started the rebellion in Fujian Province, they have been in league with the Red bandits and colluding with the violent Japanese for more than a month, and their crimes have become increasingly evident. Their actions not only betray the Kuomintang, but also attempt to overthrow the Republic of China and eliminate the Chinese nation, truly abandoning the party and the country, and abandoning the people. For the sake of saving the country, the party, and the people, they should be swiftly suppressed without any hesitation, lest the evil spread and become difficult to control, fostering hidden dangers. Moreover, frustrated military and political figures harbor malicious intentions, fearing nothing more than chaos in the world, and often seek to exploit opportunities, hoping to achieve their ambitions. If the Fujian rebellion is not quelled soon, others may follow suit and rebel, and the overall situation will become unmanageable. We humbly request that your government make a firm decision, issue a clear order to suppress them, swiftly execute the rebels to rectify their crimes, thereby stabilizing the overall situation and curbing the seeds of chaos, which would be extremely fortunate.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Telegram to Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hunan <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Respected Sirs Chen Bonan in Guangzhou, Li Delin and Bai Jiansheng in Nanning, and He Xueqiao in Changsha: The Fujian rebellion has been raging for over a month, with rebellious parties endangering the country and harming the people, displaying their evil intentions, which are clear for all to see. Although the central government has mobilized a large army to suppress them severely, the violent Japanese are watching in the north, and the Red bandits in Jiangxi are hindering them, creating numerous obstacles and making it difficult to respond with full force. We believe that you, as officials in charge of the borders, leading the military, and bearing important responsibilities, cannot stand idly by. Moreover, the rebellion of the Fujian rebels is not based on the pretext of the January 28th incident, but rather aims to overthrow the party and the country, and trample on the nation. For the sake of the party, the country, and the nation, there is absolutely no reason to stand idly by and not punish them. Failing to suppress thieves is the same as being a thief yourself, a principle understood by all. At this time of crisis for the party and the country, with the rebels rampant, right and wrong have been judged, and loyalty and rebellion have been distinguished. You cannot hesitate or look around. We humbly request that you quickly lead your valiant soldiers to assist the central government, suppress them nearby, thereby achieving twice the result with half the effort, quickly stabilizing the overall situation, and upholding the law of the country. Then your great achievements will follow Cai Songpo, and together you will be immortalized. In haste, with utmost urgency.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Maritime United Association and fifteen other organizations telegraphed the central government yesterday, echoing the Shanghai Municipal and other four special party headquarters, requesting again to issue a clear order to suppress Chen and Li, et al. Respectfully presented to the Nanjing Central Executive Committee, the National Government, and the Executive Yuan: We have investigated that the rebel Li Jishen and the rebel Chen Mingshu, et al., are falsely using public opinion in Fujian to organize a people's government, destroying the party and betraying the country, colluding with bandits and attaching themselves to the enemy, which is truly a crime deserving of death. We have previously telegraphed to request a clear order to suppress them. However, our central government intends to be lenient, giving them an opportunity to repent and reform, which has delayed the suppression. But the rebellious traitors' ambitions have not died. At a time when the national crisis is just beginning, how can we allow them to divide and weaken the central government's strength? We look to the future and feel deeply apprehensive. We humbly beg the Committee, the Government, and the Yuan not to be lenient any longer, lest it lead to a prairie fire. We ask for a clear order for a general mobilization, to suppress them swiftly, and to bring the rebel Li and Chen, et al., to justice, thereby upholding discipline and issuing a solemn warning. In haste, with utmost urgency. Respectfully presented by the Shanghai Maritime United Association, the Chinese Maritime Drivers United Association, the Nan Junan Sailors United Benevolent Association, the Yan Ying General Society, the Shan Zheng Public Office, the Bei Junan Public Office, the Yan Ying Southern Society, the Shipping Industry Public Office, the Yan Ying Tongxing Association, the New Taikoo Tallymen's Club, the Maritime Catering Workers' Union, the Maritime Tally Department Federation, the Maritime Stewards United Association, the Maritime Launch United Association, and the Maritime Xieyi Society.</p>

<p>At around nine o'clock yesterday morning, more than a thousand Japanese Navy personnel successively landed at the Liangmi Stack Wharf in Zhanghuabang, Wusong. All of them were unarmed. They then toured the outer road of Wusong Town and went to the Huafeng Spinning Factory, a Japanese-owned factory on Yunzao Road. At that time, residents were surprised by the sudden arrival of a large number of Japanese soldiers. Later, reporters inquired with the public security authorities, who said that they had been notified by their superiors that two Japanese training ships would arrive in Song that day, but due to tidal conditions, they could not enter the port. The navy landed nearby for sightseeing and had no other intentions. Therefore, the police, led by District Chief Xi of the Seventh Public Security District and Yao, the head of the first branch of the Seventh Public Security District, and Officer Li of the water patrol team, were dispatched to take care of the situation. At that time, the Wusong Chamber of Commerce also notified all shops in the town not to misunderstand. It is now known that the Japanese soldiers left the shore successively in the afternoon and returned to their ships.</p>

<p>Zhao Guanda, a villager in Gaoqiao, Pudong, was fond of hunting. Every day, he carried a gun to the fields to hunt. The day before yesterday, he went to the fields about ten miles away from the town. He spotted a giant bird flying in the sky, raised his gun, and aimed to fire. Unexpectedly, the gun exploded in the barrel, and the bullet flew backward, hitting Zhao's head and other parts, causing him to fall to the ground and die instantly. Villagers saw this and inquired in the town. Zhao's family then went to investigate and wanted to collect the body. However, the Third District Fourth Police Station, considering that the matter involved human life, ordered the local security officer Gao Linquan to report it to the local court for examination. Zhao's family petitioned the court for exemption from the examination.</p>

<p>Yao Wenrang, a Cantonese man, 22 years old, wearing a suit and leather shoes, was an elegant young man. He rented a room at No. 17 Daderi, North Sichuan Road, and was studying at the China Medical College on Bazhi Road. At around nine o'clock the night before, he suddenly checked into the Hongkou Hotel on North Sichuan Road with his friend. He was guided to Room 43 on the second floor. Because the room was small, with only one single bed, the two of them shared a bed, which was uncomfortable. At around twelve o'clock, Yao checked into Room 54 to sleep. When entering the hotel, he wrote on the registration book that he was a Cantonese man named Guang Youtian from the academic community, and his friend's name was Tuo Lei. Then they separated and went to sleep. Until eleven o'clock yesterday morning, his friend got up and went to Room 54. He knocked on the door several times, but there was no answer for a long time. Suspecting something was wrong, he called the tea boy, who pried open the glass window and entered the room. He saw that Yao's face had turned pale and he was delirious. It was suspected that he had taken poison. He immediately reported to the police station by telephone and ordered an ambulance to the scene, which rushed him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. His life was in critical condition.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Wang Yunqu is Granted a Divorce from Wang Mulu, One-Sided Debate Ends in Judgment <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Wang Mulu, the son of Suzhou silk merchant Wang Xingyi, studied medicine and married Ms. Wang Yunqu. In the early days of their marriage, they were quite harmonious and had several children. Years ago, Mulu's business in the south was sluggish, and the business run by his father also declined. He went north to Tianjin and Jinzhou to seek a living. After becoming a traveler, he indulged in debauchery and became addicted to opium. Ms. Wang feared that her husband would become addicted to pleasure and degenerate over time. She once went to Tianjin, hoping to persuade him to return. However, Mulu suddenly forgot their old affection and avoided seeing her. She had to return south in resentment, and her father-in-law, Xingyi, no longer continued to support her. So she hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to sue Xingyi in the First Special District Local Court, requesting funds to maintain her livelihood. The court summoned both father-in-law and daughter-in-law and persuaded them to reconcile. Wang Xingyi agreed to pay Wang Yunqu and her five children 20 yuan a month and to be responsible for the education, clothing, and food expenses. The case was settled with signatures in court. Unexpectedly, Wang Xingyi was unwilling to part with a single hair and would rather break his promise to his daughter-in-law and grandchildren than provide funds for their support. His son, Mulu, was recently convicted by the local court in Tianjin for privately smoking opium and imprisoned in the Hebei Third Prison. Xingyi loved his son deeply and paid money for him, which made Wang Yunqu feel that the Wang family treated them differently and that they were extremely ungrateful. In order to seek a thorough solution, she hired lawyer Chen again to file a divorce lawsuit against Mulu and requested that the defendant be ordered to pay living expenses and return the dowry. The First Special Court held several hearings. The defendant knew he was in the wrong and avoided appearing. Judge Peng allowed the one-sided debate to end and pronounced judgment yesterday, granting the plaintiff Wang Yunqu a divorce from the defendant Wang Mulu, ordering the defendant to pay the plaintiff 5,000 yuan for alimony, and ordering that all the dowry should be returned to the plaintiff. The 1,300 yuan owed to the plaintiff should also be repaid, and the litigation costs should be borne by the defendant.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Improvement of the Beijing-Shanghai Line, Allocation Method of Passenger and Freight Cars, Reducing Waste and Developing Freight Transport <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration has recently prepared charts showing the density of monthly passenger numbers at various stations along the two lines and submitted them to the Ministry of Railways for verification. The Ministry of Railways believes that the number of seats provided on the current passenger trains on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway exceeds the demand and that the engine power used for passenger trains should be saved to develop freight transport. The Ministry of Railways also issued several instructions. The administration has followed these instructions. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e181">Reducing Waste <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry ordered a reduction in the number of through passenger trains running by three or four to avoid wasting passenger seats on the Nanjing-Changzhou section. The Ministry also suggested replacing the reduced number of through passenger trains with through mixed trains to balance passenger convenience with the development of freight transport. The administration complied and converted the 11th and 12th Beijing-Shanghai up and down third- and fourth-class trains into through mixed trains between Beijing and Shanghai. When departing from the departure station, the number of through passenger and freight cars attached was determined based on passenger and freight transport conditions and the engine's towing capacity, to fully consider passenger and freight transport needs.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Full Equipment <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry ordered that Wuxi be used as a center and that sufficient car allocation equipment be added to the station so that when trains arrive at the station, they can be re-allocated according to passenger and freight transport needs before departing. The Changzhou, Suzhou, and Kunshan stations should also gradually add car allocation equipment. For the time being, the Wuxi station should be used as a freight transshipment center. All downbound mixed passenger and freight cars arriving at the station should have some freight cars detached and replaced with various types of passenger cars suitable for transporting passengers from Wuxi to Shanghai. Upbound mixed trains can have various types of passenger cars attached between Shanghai and Wuxi to transport passengers from Shanghai to Wuxi. After arriving in Wuxi, the number of passengers decreases, so some passenger cars can be detached and replaced with an appropriate number of freight cars to reach Nanjing. The administration complied and, when the 7th and 8th Beijing-Shanghai up and down express trains and the 9th Beijing-Shanghai downbound express train arrived at the Wuxi station, the number of passenger and freight cars were detached and attached according to passenger and freight transport conditions and the engine's towing capacity. If all freight cars at the Wuxi station could not be allocated into a train, the department should follow the usual practice and open short-distance freight trains at any time for transshipment. A shunting engine must be added at the Wuxi station so that after each train arrives, the passenger and freight cars to be attached and detached can be quickly arranged to avoid delaying the train's travel time. The locomotive department has also complied.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Mixed Trains <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry ordered that mixed trains should be composed of one third-class passenger car, one baggage and car guard car, and the rest freight cars. If there are many passengers, passenger cars can be added and freight cars reduced to balance passenger and freight transport needs. The administration has complied with the order and converted the 19th and 24th Shanghai-Changzhou short-distance trains, the 21st and 22nd Shanghai-Wuxi short-distance trains, and the 23rd and 24th Wuxi-Beijing short-distance trains into mixed passenger and freight trains since the implementation of the Third Timetable, attaching freight cars in addition to the passenger cars. Now, the administration is again complying with the order to reduce the number of passenger cars attached and attach as many freight cars as possible to these and other short-distance trains, according to passenger and freight transport conditions along the line and the engine's towing capacity.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Ministry Instructions <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry also issued two instructions: 1. Open short-distance freight trains between Shanghai and Wuxi to transship the freight cars detached from the downbound mixed trains at Wuxi and the freight cars transported to Wuxi to be attached to the upbound mixed trains to reach Nanjing. 2. For regular freight trains with faster travel times, third- and fourth-class passenger cars can be attached to sections with high passenger traffic when necessary. Since this involves changes to fares, speed, and stopping times, the administration plans to conduct a thorough study and plan before complying with the order to revise the 301st and 302nd Shanghai-Pinglian Through Train Timetable in March next year and implement it all at once.</p>

<p>The Yangzhong Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Association believes that since the land tax tragedy occurred in the county, it has been a month and there has been no solution. Villagers have fled in all directions, displaced and destitute. The cold winter has arrived, and their suffering is unspeakable. Regarding the issue of reducing land tax surcharges, various counties in Jiangsu Province have successively complied with the order and reduced them in accordance with reality. In Yangzhong, armed police teams are still going out to collect taxes and oppressing the people by all means. In order to save their hometown and their families, the association specially appointed Wu Chuzhong, Zhu Shouhuang, and Huang Zhilan to go to the province on the night express train yesterday to petition the Provincial Party Department, the Provincial Government, the Civil Affairs Department, the Finance Department, and the Security Department. After completing their tasks, they will go to Beijing to petition the Central Party Department, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of the Interior, requesting an investigation and handling in accordance with the law in order to warn corrupt officials and appease public anger.</p>

<p>The YWCA National Goods Exhibition on Yuanmingyuan Road was extended by one day to the 17th and opened to the public. It is said that many people from all walks of life came that day. The details are recorded below. The 16th was the most popular day. Therefore, the recreational performances were performed once more, once at 7 p.m. and once at 9 p.m., filling the hall. At around 9 p.m., Mr. Yu and his wife and daughter graciously attended the exhibition and expressed their great appreciation for the model families and other displays. The exhibition opened to the public on the 17th and stopped admitting visitors at 6 p.m. The conference then closed. It is said that the exhibition received a great deal of assistance from all walks of life. The venue layout was voluntarily sponsored by the following factories: "Design" by Lu Qianshou of the Bank of China, "Wood" by the workers of the Dachang Construction Company, "Labor" by the Chen Yongxing Construction Company, "Paint" by the Zhenhua Paint Factory, "Electric Lights" by the Xingtai Water and Electricity Materials Factory, "New Year's Red Lanterns" by the Dongfang New Year's Red Lantern Company, and the paper for the special issue was donated by the Tianzhang Paper Company.

<h3 id="e188">Lecture Notes from the Engineering Society, Chen Ticheng Lectures on Highway Construction, Zheng Hua Lectures on the Nanjing Ferry Project <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Chinese Institute of Engineers held its December regular meeting at the Bankers' Association Club on the evening of the 18th of this month. More than 50 people attended. After the dinner, Chairman Xu Peihuang reported on the recent situation of the association. Then, Mr. Chen Ticheng, director of the Highway Department of the National Economic Council, was invited to lecture on highway construction. Mr. Chen said that there is an urgent need for highways in our country. Although cars and gasoline come from foreign countries, it is inevitable that profits will flow out. However, all parties are currently trying to manufacture vehicles and search for oil-producing areas, which is not impossible to reverse. The methods of raising funds for road construction that are feasible in Europe and America are not suitable for our country. The method adopted by Zhejiang Province is to allow merchants to operate long-distance buses, collecting a contribution fee on one hand and using this contribution fee as collateral for borrowing money on the other hand to build other roads. This cycle has been quite effective. The width of the highway surface, the quality of its building materials, and other engineering matters depend on the transportation conditions and the ability to raise funds. Next, Dr. Zheng Hua, chief of the Design Section of the Ministry of Railways, was invited to lecture on the Nanjing Xiaguan Pukou ferry project. Dr. Zheng briefly said that the Jinpu and Jinghu railways are separated by the Yangtze River, and there has long been a desire to connect them. Since the water is very deep, it is not suitable to build tunnels or bridges. A ferry should be used. However, the water level varies by two feet between winter and summer, so it is necessary to find a way to compensate. The British suggested using a ship with two decks. The Dutch suggested using a floating dock ferry. The Americans suggested using a rocking bed principle of construction. I studied bridge engineering and thought of using a movable approach bridge to solve the problem. The plan was completed and sent abroad for estimation. The price was relatively cheap, so it was implemented. The Pukou and Xiaguan bridges are exactly the same. The bridge is more than 600 feet long and divided into four spans. Close to the beach, one end uses a pivot to connect the other spans. Each end and the adjacent end are suspended from the bridge tower with large screws. As the water level rises and falls, electricity is used to keep the span connected to the ferry level. The maximum slope of the other spans is 2%. The benches are single-track, but the span near the beach has three tracks. The ferry is 370 feet long and has three tracks, each 300 feet long, capable of carrying 20 40-ton cars. Each crossing of the river takes about one and a half hours. It has now been completed and is operating smoothly. The daily income is about 8,000 yuan. The benefits to itself are great, and the Jinghu Railway also benefits greatly. In the past, the railway's passenger transport was greater than its freight transport. Now the opposite is true and the business is booming. Both Mr. Chen and Mr. Zheng based their lectures on their expertise, carefully planned according to the domestic situation, adapted to the needs, and took into account both engineering and economics. It is a celebration for the country to have such talents. After the lectures, members asked questions and discussed them, showing a strong interest, which was unprecedented at past branch meetings. The meeting adjourned at more than ten o'clock.</p>

<p>It was recently heard that the Zhabei Charity Group discussed preparing for winter relief gruel distribution. Due to the aftermath of the January 28th Incident last year, there are many impoverished people in Zhabei. Additionally, various silk factories have been successively closing down due to silk prices, leaving many laborers unemployed and the poor in great numbers. The gruel kitchen is being urgently ordered to be repaired by craftsmen as soon as possible, lest it freezes over and repair becomes impossible. Furthermore, reports are being sent to various directors and soliciting agreement for continued joint assistance from organizations such as the Joint Association of Charity Groups, the Chinese Jisheng Society, the Moral General Society, the Xinwei Relief Society, the Red Cross Society, the Red Swastika Society, Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory, and various philanthropists, etc., as before. This is because there are even more poor people than before; otherwise, there are concerns about severe financial difficulties.</p>

<p>Wu Tiecheng, the Mayor of Shanghai and concurrently Commander of the Songhu Garrison, spares no effort in promoting industry. Last month, he agreed with Hu Xiyuan of the China Arbutus Electric Appliance Factory to visit the factory's operations and all its equipment. However, this was not immediately carried out because the factory was in the process of installing the latest machinery. Now that the installation is complete, Wu, accompanied by Secretary Tang Shixuan and staff, visited the Arbutus Factory in Yangshupu yesterday afternoon. He was received by Hu Xiyuan, General Manager of the factory, Feng Jiazheng, Assistant Manager, and Li Xinfang, Head of the General Affairs Department, among others. They first rested briefly in the reception room and then visited the various sections of the glass bulb production. Wu repeatedly nodded, expressing satisfaction and praise for the factory's perfect equipment and meticulous layout. He then went to the conference hall for refreshments and personally inscribed the phrases "Save the country through industry and cultivate citizens with professions to support themselves and be worthy of a model factory." He then had a photo taken and returned home when all the houses were lit up.</p>

<p>Gong Shunbing, a native of Wuxi, is twenty years old. On the evening of the 19th of last month, at 9 p.m., he raped Xingfen, the fifteen-year-old daughter of Pan Ling, at the Xu family residence in Rongfu Lane on West Aihams Road. Pan Ling, along with the girl's mother, found Gong and turned him over to the French police for detention. After the police sent the girl to the hospital and verified that she had indeed been raped, Gong was sent to the Second Special District Court for public prosecution. During the interrogation, Gong admitted the rape without reservation and hired lawyer Zhang Shijie to defend him. The case had already been declared closed and a date set for sentencing. However, due to doubts about the girl's age at the time of birth, the debate was reopened, as reported in previous newspapers. The trial has now concluded, and yesterday morning, Judge Wang Gangxu presided over the court and sentenced Gong Shunbing to three years and six months of imprisonment for raping a girl under the age of sixteen. The number of days of detention before the judgment is final will be counted as one day of imprisonment for every two days of detention.

<p>Mu Axiang, a Ningbo native, residing at No. 17 Puhua Lane, Dongyouheng Road, Hongkou, was a fishmonger. He operated a stall at the Tongzhou Road wet market. Every morning, he hired a truck to go to Xiaodongmen to purchase goods. At 4 a.m. on the 15th of this month, Mu hired a truck (F-1347) from the Xin Lianhe Trucking Company at the Taoyuan Lane entrance of the Tilanqiao. The driver, Zhao Yunlong from Jiangbei, drove south to purchase fresh fish from the fish market outside Xiaodongmen and loaded it onto the truck. Mu also sat next to the goods on the way back north to sell them. Unexpectedly, at 6 a.m., the truck was traveling north along the Bund when, at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII, tram No. 47 of route 8 of the British Tramway Company, which ran between Yangshupu and the 16th Pier, was traveling south. When it reached the intersection of Avenue Edward VII, the pointsman mistakenly switched the tracks, causing the tram to mistakenly take the wrong route. The tram turned west into the intersection of Avenue Edward VII when the truck was also speeding north, causing the two vehicles to be unable to brake and stop, resulting in a collision. Mu, who was sitting on the truck, was shaken off and fell, suffering a head injury and bleeding profusely. Both vehicles were damaged. The police recorded the license plate numbers and sent the injured person and the vehicles to Renji Hospital and reported to the police station. However, Mu died at 10 p.m. the night before due to his severe injuries. The hospital notified the police station, which transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home for an autopsy. Yesterday, the French police vehicle affairs department reported to the Second Special District Court, which appointed Prosecutor Wang Ren to conduct an autopsy with the forensic doctor. The official sat in court, and Mu Shengmu, the father of the deceased, stated that the deceased was his son, who died tragically from a car accident and requested justice. The official questioned the truck driver Zhao Yunlong and the tram driver Shi Wanqian about the circumstances of the accident. The official announced that Mu Axiang had died from a head injury caused by a collision between the vehicles. The body was claimed by the father for burial. The vehicle affairs department will investigate the negligence of the defendants and handle the case according to law.</p>

<p>Huishan Police Detectives Liu Baoshan and Yin Zhanqing learned that a large number of bandits had fled from Pudong to Shanghai and were hiding in Room 4, Tangshan Inn, No. 424 Tangshan Road. They collaborated with Western detectives and secretly went to the address and arrested six Pudong residents: Zhang Xiaodi, Lu Jinsheng, Xu Miaosheng, Yang Gensheng, Xu Peixiang, and Yang Chuantang. They confiscated 108 yuan, 14 double coins, and gold jewelry, including bracelets and rings, and brought them to the police station. The police chief ordered them to be detained and sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated the previous situation, stating that the defendants robbed a Zhang family in Zhangjiaxiang, Datuan Town, Pudong on the 17th at midnight. The pistol was borrowed from Qin Zhanglin and was held by Zhang Xiaodi. Qin was arrested by the public security in his residence at No. 778 Zhaojia Road in Nanshi. Please send a letter to transfer the case to this court for an extension. Check whether the defendants have committed crimes in the concession and submit the stolen goods for inspection. Zhang Xiaodi admitted to knowing Qin Zhanglin and that the pistol was given to him by Qin and returned to him afterward. The others evaded the question. Lu Jinsheng and others claimed that they were invited by Zhang Xiaodi and that the victim's name was Zhang Weisheng, who was their uncle. They said they were going to borrow money and not rob, and asked for understanding. Judge Liu Yugui ordered them to be remanded in custody and rescheduled for verification.</p>

<p>At 1:50 p.m. yesterday, a coal fire in the rice cooking stove in the kitchen on the second floor of the British Taikoo Steamship Company on Xinkaihe in the French Concession suddenly erupted. Smoke filled the room, and a neighbor who saw it thought it was a fire and broke the fire alarm glass. The fire alarm rang immediately, causing tension among all the staff. After a while, the French Concession Fire Brigade received the news and rushed to the scene with as many as eleven fire trucks. The road on Yong'an Street was crowded with firefighters. They were about to drag the hoses to put out the fire, but the smoke on the upper floor had already dissipated. After checking, nothing was burned. Only two cooks were burned on their faces, wrists, and feet. The injuries were minor and they were not sent to the hospital. The firefighters saw that there was no fire and investigated the area before withdrawing. According to Ma Fuqing from Jiangbei, one of the injured cooks, the cause of the accident was that he was cleaning the room after the meal and put the swept garbage into the stove to burn it. Unexpectedly, when he put the garbage in, there was a sudden loud bang, and smoke and fire shot out, causing him to be burned. Another cook from Suzhou was also affected, but fortunately, his injuries were minor, and neither of them went to the hospital. However, all the staff were scared.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Iron Bar Falls from Balcony: Hits Two Children, One Dead, One Injured: Public Works Department Does Not Allow Alteration: Liu Ma's Children Die Unjustly <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Liu Ma, a woman from Shandong, who lives in a kitchen at No. 44 Tai'an Lane, Beishan West Road, has a son and a daughter. The son is named Mao Tou and the daughter is named Axiang, both of whom are very young. At noon on the 15th of this month, the two children were playing at the entrance when, unexpectedly, an iron bar about ten feet long fell from the balcony of the house and hit the children's heads and other parts, causing serious injuries. Their mother saw it and sent Mao Tou and others to Shanghai Sanitarium for treatment. Axiang was more seriously injured and died the day before yesterday despite all efforts. Mao Tou is still being treated in the hospital, and his life cannot be predicted. The hospital reported to the Huishi Police Station, which ordered detectives to investigate. It was learned that the iron bar, which was dropped by Yin Zhonghe, the second landlord of the house, was used to support the bamboo for drying clothes. It was very strong, but Yin planned to build another small house on the balcony, so he removed the iron bar. However, this was discovered by the Sanitary Department of the Public Works Department, which did not allow it due to regulations. Therefore, Yin had no choice but to call a mason to reinstall the original iron bar, but because it was not installed securely, it suddenly fell the day before yesterday. The detectives carried the girl's body to the Feilun Road Autopsy Center. Yesterday, Prosecutor Diao Chengtang, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan, clerk Wang Zuyi, and others, were appointed by the First Special District Court to conduct an autopsy. Liu Ma, the mother of the deceased, testified about the previous situation. Diao then announced that Liu Axiang, a female, had died from a head injury caused by the iron bar before her death. The body was given to her mother, Liu Ma, who signed a guarantee to take it back for burial.</p>

<h3 id="e203">Can New Signs Be Charged with Additional House Tax? Yuan Yuan Hat Shop Requests Arbitration: Taxpayer Association Forwards Letter to Public Works Department <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayer Association sent a letter to the Director-General of the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday, stating: "According to a letter from the Yuan Yuan Hat Shop, 'Our shop is located at the corner of Shandong Road and Jiujiang Road. The old Public Works Department street numbers were 213 to 216, and the new street numbers are now 320 and 324. The monthly rent is 434 yuan and 15 cents. The Public Works Department has always calculated the total tax at 14% of the rent, and the monthly total tax is 60 yuan and 2 cents, which is 180 yuan and 6 cents per quarter. Now, when the Public Works Department collected the winter tax, it changed the 180 yuan and 6 cents on the tax bill to 193 yuan and 2 cents in red ink, which means that the scattered rent is falsely increased by 30 yuan per month. Our shop believed that the Public Works Department should not increase the tax for no reason and consulted with the Westerners who collect the tax below. They instructed us to contact the Western leader of the house tax in room 263 on the third floor with the tax bill. A Chinese person named Yao translated in that room, saying that the 14% calculation of our shop's tax bill was correct, but because our shop had recently been renovated and used chrome-plated sign letters, etc., which were quite valuable, the monthly rent had to be increased by 30 yuan. Our manager stated that it was actually because the market was sluggish and business was poor, so the facade was renovated in order to attract customers. Our shop's building had an old-fashioned wooden balcony, which had been in disrepair for many years and was about to collapse. We were afraid that it would injure pedestrians, so we discussed with the landlord to remove the wooden balcony. But after the wooden balcony was removed, the appearance was not very beautiful, so we slightly embellished it with a cement false wall. All of this was done as a last resort. How can we increase the tax burden again? Unexpectedly, the Westerner said that the tax must be increased, at least about 20 yuan. We think that at a time when the market is declining and all industries are depressed, the Public Works Department should reduce taxes to ease the difficulties of businesses. It is reasonable not to impose heavy taxes on merchants because of their unavoidable difficulties and facade renovations, and then to take the opportunity to increase the size of the house and extort merchants. In terms of renovation, three or four out of ten shops on various roads have closed down due to the poor market. But if there are occasional new shops opening, they will definitely re-renovate. Should the Public Works Department not calculate the actual rent and increase the tax? For example, in the Nanjing Road area, the same house with the same rent often changes tenants several times a year. In that year, the house must be renovated several times. Does the Public Works Department want to increase the tax several times within a year? In terms of the value of the renovation, for example, there are several similar houses in the same concession, rented to people. Suppose there is a tenant who installs his own water heater, installs new electric heating and cooling equipment, and everything inside is decorated luxuriously. The walls are also painted and the windows are changed. The cost is very high. Does the Public Works Department also want to increase the tax according to the value of the decoration? This is truly an unreasonable argument. Therefore, Yao's statement that the tax should be increased because the chrome-plated sign letters are of great value is absurd. But the Westerner has been asking to see our shop's renovation accounts, and our shop is very disturbed. We hereby present the whole story and ask you to forward the details to the Public Works Department and ask the Chinese directors to arbitrate with the bureau to ease the difficulties of businesses. This would be greatly appreciated. The association believes that municipal taxes should be based on the actual rent, which is the most legal and reasonable method, and is respected by your bureau. Taxpayers are very admired. Now that this case has occurred, the reason for increasing the rent is the value of the sign. The association firmly believes that your bureau will not have such a random financial policy, or that lower-level employees are seeking something else through this. The red ink used to change the donation ticket is already suspicious. In short, municipal taxes should be based on the actual rent, and falsely increasing the rent is a tax increase, which is in fundamental conflict with the resolution of the Taxpayers' Meeting. If a lower-level employee is acting recklessly, it should be considered an overreach of authority. If it is a case of ulterior motives, it should be considered dereliction of duty. According to the letter, we hereby request your bureau to order your subordinates to collect the total tax based on the actual rent, and not to disturb and interfere with the law."</p>

<p>Regarding the long-standing labor dispute at the Yufeng Cotton Mill in Zhengzhou, nearly 369 bales of yarn stored in the factory were carried away by the workers, who intended to sell the yarn to provide for their living expenses. It has been learned that the Cotton Control Committee has sent technical specialist Tong Lüqing to Zhengzhou to investigate the truth of the case on the ground. The letter from the Banking Association to the Cotton Control Committee and the reply from the Cotton Control Committee are recorded below.</p>

<p>"Our association, on behalf of the China, Shanghai, and Zhejiang Industrial Banks, has seized the cotton yarn of the Yufeng Cotton Mill in Zhengzhou, which was forcibly taken by the factory's union, causing a dispute. We have telegraphed the authorities in Beijing and Henan, as well as your association, to uphold justice. Recently, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce sent a telegram stating, 'Having read the telegram, we learned that the labor dispute at the Yufeng Cotton Mill in Zhengzhou has been unresolved for a long time. According to the Henan Provincial Construction Department, the factory has violated the decision in the past and refused mediation in the future. The responsible personnel have avoided meeting. The chairman of the factory, Mu Xiangyue, telegraphed that the cotton mill has been mortgaged to Shenchang Foreign Company and that the company's resident representative, Mr. Stimpert, has taken over, etc. Mediation cannot be carried out. However, thousands of workers are desperate for life and are starving and freezing. Although they have received very good training, they may be incited by reactionaries. The future is very worrying, etc.' We have ordered the department to handle the matter fairly to avoid trouble. According to the previous situation in the telegram, in addition to re-ordering the department, we hereby reply by telegram, etc. From the perspective of the current telegram from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the inside story is very complicated and cannot be mediated in a few words. The China and other three banks are in danger of losing their seized goods. For this reason, we ask your association whether it can select capable personnel to go directly to the site to investigate the truth and find ways to remedy the situation, so that the seized goods will not be sold without authorization. The matter is urgent, and we are looking forward to it.'"</p>

<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration issued a notice yesterday stating that the post office has now produced special airmail envelopes for sending airmail letters, available in both Chinese and Western styles. These are stocked at the counters of various post offices. The Western-style envelope is 11 cm in height and 15 cm in width. The front is printed with two dark blue horizontal lines, with space left above the two horizontal lines for affixing stamps. Between the two lines, the words "Par Aviou" are printed. On the left side of the vertical lines, the words "Airmail" are printed. The Chinese-style envelope has wavy green lines printed around the four edges of the front and back covers. In the center of the front, a rectangular box is printed in red for writing the recipient's name. In the upper left corner, the word "Airmail" is also printed, making it very conspicuous. The public is welcome to imitate the design if they wish. If airmail letters are sent using ordinary envelopes, blue airmail labels must still be affixed. These labels can be obtained directly from the post offices. Otherwise, if the above regulations are not followed, and the item is not sent by airmail, the post office will not be responsible.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Strict Precautions Remain During Winter Defense Period; Police Chief Issues Order to Subordinates to Comply <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>The city's military and police agencies previously received secret reports of reactionary elements attempting to disrupt public order under cover. Therefore, precautions were taken consecutively on the 11th, 12th, 16th, 17th, 18th, and 19th. Fortunately, the precautions were effective, and no incidents occurred, nor were any reactionary publications discovered, so peace was maintained. However, the Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Wen Hongen, yesterday issued an order to all officers and police officers of the district offices, branches, and police stations under his jurisdiction, as well as to personnel from the detective and supervisory departments, that during this winter defense period, and while the Fujian Incident has not been extinguished and martial law has not been lifted, they should all be extra vigilant to prevent unforeseen events.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Shanghai Court: Renovation of Detention Center Completed; Courtrooms Increased to Fourteen <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>A telegram from Beijing stated that the Ministry of Judicial Administration considered the Shanghai Local Court detention center to be too small and allocated funds for construction, etc. A reporter from the Central News Agency inquired about this matter to the clerk of the court, Wang Xun, yesterday morning. According to his reply, the existing detention center of the Shanghai Local Court was only a two-story building, accommodating more than 200 prisoners. However, by this summer, the number had reached more than 800. The building was insufficient, so approval was obtained from superiors to allocate 50,000 yuan to rebuild a new three-story detention center on the original site. After three months of construction, it was completed at the beginning of last month. The center can accommodate more than 1,000 prisoners. In addition, the Shanghai Local Court originally had twelve courtrooms, which have now been increased to fourteen. Further additions will be made as needed based on the actual situation.</p>

<h3 id="e216">The Tobacco and Exchange Industries to Discuss License Tax Today <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>Since the autumn of this year, the collection of tobacco and liquor license tax for Shanghai Bao has been undertaken by Ding Jinsheng, chairman of the Shanghai Shaoxing Wine Industry Association, as the chief collector. Because the contracted amount is too large, the collection and remittance are reportedly very different. It is said that there is a large difference. Now, under the order of the sub-bureau director, rectification will be carried out, and it is stipulated that starting from January 1st of next year, it must be strictly implemented and collected according to regulations. Letters have been sent to the two associations of Shanghai Bao to comply. It is heard that the Tobacco and Exchange Industry Association will convene a meeting of members today to decide on a method. First, they will negotiate with the tax authorities, requesting that they continue to collect taxes as usual in order to show consideration and avoid misunderstandings. The reason is that most of the businesses in this industry are small shops, operating with meager capital and earning only a small profit to support their families, which is truly difficult. They have been donating two yuan per quarter for the license. If rectified according to the regulations of the Ministry, they will have to pay four yuan per quarter. Other larger stores will generally increase their tax level according to their business situation and in accordance with regulations, fearing that it will be difficult to bear if implemented. A remedy is planned, and the tax authorities are scheduled to meet this Monday to discuss the matter. However, they have not yet met. Therefore, a notice was issued to the North and South Shanghai offices yesterday, calling for an emergency meeting to be convened nearby to determine a policy. The two offices immediately forwarded the notice to all representatives to discuss the matter at a meeting at 3:00 p.m. today. The meeting in Nanshi will be held at No. 427 Fumin Road, and the meeting in Beishi will be held at No. 8 Wanxiang Lane, Ai'erjin Road, on the same day.</p>

<p>The Jiangxi Guild Hall on South Railway Station Branch Road originally had a funeral home to house the coffins of fellow provincials. However, the guild hall's members' congress resolved to allocate the land to build the Jiangxi Vocational High School. Therefore, land was purchased elsewhere on Huta Road in Dachang to rebuild a new funeral home. Huang Baoxiang, Wang Zhulin, Lu Haiquan, Dai Yuheng, Li Langqu, Liu Shaomei, Shi Yuemen, Liu Wushu, Hu Neisheng, and nine others were appointed to be responsible for the matter. It is heard that the funeral home has been completed, and a completion ceremony was held yesterday morning. A public memorial ceremony was held in the afternoon, with Mr. Li Liejun presiding over the ceremony. In addition to Li Liejun, Xu Yuanhao, Luo Jiaheng, Chen Shaoxian, Xu Suzhong, Shi Yuemen, Dai Yuheng, Huang Baoxiang, Hu Neisheng, and Pan Zhenya, several dozen people attended. Guests included Xie Yuanhan, officials and gentry from the Dachang District of Baoshan County, representatives of the Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association, and the directors of the Nanjing Jiangxi Guild Hall, Zhang Yuan and two others, totaling over one hundred and several dozen people. Huta Road was very lively.</p>

<p>Special Sacrifice in Winter Low Prices: Every year when winter arrives, merchants in this city hold big sales. Among these big sales, there are even more special sacrifices. For example, the Samsung Cotton and Iron Factory on Nanjing Road and Shilu West Road is holding a winter sale because customers have loved its products for a year. Not only are various cotton fabrics sold at 30% or 20% off the original price, but even items sacrificed at half price are prepared. These half-price items are the factory's most famous colorfast electric cloth, as well as various colored serges and checkered thick flannels, all of which are daily necessities for families.</p>
<p>Excellent Products from Zhenxing Woolen Mill: The Shuanglong brand four-strand and six-strand woolen yarn produced by the Zhenxing Woolen Textile Mill on Xujiahui Road in this city is a giant among domestic woolen yarns. Since its launch, it has spread throughout the country. With the arrival of winter, sales are even stronger. Anyone who sells this woolen yarn enjoys generous profits, so major domestic product companies both inside and outside the city are happy to promote it. The factory also has a kind of Xuechi soft flannel, which has an elastic body and is completely comparable to Vienna from a certain country, but the price is less than one-third. After investigation by reporters, it was learned that the raw materials for this product are top-quality wool, mixed with a small amount of kapok, and spun and refined using the latest technology. It is very suitable for clothing in all seasons, regardless of men, women, old or young. It is heard that the factory's store in the Penglai Market, in addition to selling various self-made clothing fabrics and Shuanglong brand woolen yarn, also sells other items such as bathrobes, towels, bed sheets, and various colored shirt fabrics to meet customer needs.</p>

<h3 id="e223">Dai Yingguan Inspects Educational Conditions in Ji and Ping; No National Army East of Lutai; Thriving Japanese Language Research Support Associations <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>Dai Yingguan, Section Chief of the Ministry of Education, has returned from inspecting education in Hebei Province and Beiping City. The following is a description of his inspection of the educational conditions in Ji and Ping:</p>
<p>The most peculiar situation in Hebei Province's education sector is probably in the schools along the Beining Railway line. Since the signing of the so-called Tanggu Truce, the war zone has been nominally "taken over," and schools in various locations have勉强 (barely managed to) open. Besides the fact that school buildings have been damaged in many cases due to the stationing of Japanese and puppet troops, and that books, instruments, specimens, etc., have also been mostly damaged or lost, making immediate restoration impossible, all teaching and moral education in the schools are subjected to external pressure and cannot be carried out as usual. For example, the "Principles of the Party" subject is not allowed to be offered; the portrait and will of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen are not allowed to be displayed; memorial weeks are not allowed to be held. Even when lecturing on history, lecturers cannot speak freely regarding the tragic events and national humiliation facts of past years. Furthermore, the Japanese troops stationed in the area often send people to inspect the schools at will, and promote the establishment of Japanese language courses, introducing Japanese language teachers. In the Luan Dong area, Japanese Language Research Support Associations are established everywhere, enticing people to join and pay a membership fee of at least half a yuan per month to study Japanese. Calling them "Support Associations" clearly indicates that their purpose is more than just research. They tell the public that those who join the association can not only study Japanese but also receive protection. In other words, all members are guaranteed not to be anti-Japanese elements. Before each Support Association is established, it issues leaflets listing the titles and names of local political, academic, and business leaders as "supporters" for publicity. Those listed who dare to deny it are immediately labeled as anti-Japanese elements, and being anti-Japanese is tantamount to being reactionary, which can lead to immediate arrest. Therefore, those who have been designated as supporters do not dare to openly deny it, and the influence of the Support Associations grows daily. Now, branch associations have also been established in places like Tangshan in Luanxi, and it is likely that they will spread along the Beining line. An even more shocking matter is that there is a small mountain in Tangshan town where Chinese and Japanese people live together. Gambling dens, brothels, and opium dens have been opened, and kidnapping and extortion are rampant, with no evil left undone. The local Public Security Bureau once sent police to arrest more than 70 establishments, but they were interfered with by external forces and were forced to compensate the Japanese merchants for several thousand yuan in losses, and all those arrested were released. Afterwards, the merchants' influence became even greater, and the Public Security Bureau had to arrest more than 80 establishments a second time. The result was even more outrageous, with the release still occurring, and the compensation being increased. From then on, the merchants boldly wrote the words "Officially Approved Business" in front of their doors, and no one dared to question it. This kind of phenomenon is not only related to educational issues, but also makes social education absolutely impossible. The war zone is nominally a "non-armed zone," but the soldiers seen at each station along the Beining line are indeed numerous, especially east of Lutai, where our army is not allowed to go. The locals say, "No National Army east of Lutai," which is in stark contrast to the Japanese-backed Support Associations, which are constantly advancing westward. Apart from the Beining line, the overall educational situation in Hebei Province is still good. Taking secondary schools as an example, Tianjin has the renowned Nankai Middle School, Baoding has the long-established and talent-filled Yude Middle School, and there is also the rising Tongren Middle School, all of which can be considered excellent. The Tianjin Women's Teachers College, originally expanded from a women's normal school, still has normal and secondary school departments. Its science equipment and teaching conditions are probably rare among women's normal schools in various provinces. After the tragic incident last year at Baoding Normal School, Principal Xiao Hansan took over and thoroughly reformed it, purchasing more than 800 mu of land, divided into experimental and economic zones. Every afternoon, two classes of students work in the two zones, with each class spending three afternoons a week working entirely in the fields. The principal and teachers personally lead the way, and both zones have been inspected. The students work very hard and are extremely interested. The vocational schools in Baoding have three departments: textile, machinery, and applied chemistry. The textile chemistry department has female student classes that are well-developed. The practical training time does not differ much from the standards set by the ministry, and they can still be realistic. The secondary vocational department of Tianjin Institute of Technology can hardly utilize the factory equipment of the institute, and the students are not very developed. In general, the secondary education situation in places along the Pinghan Line, such as Baoding, Zhengding, Dingxian, and Cangzhou along the Jinpu Line, seems to be better than in Tianjin, especially in Baoding. There are ten public and private secondary schools in the area. Except for two schools that are small in scale, the rest have both spirit and form, and the students are very simple, disciplined, and fond of sports. The girls dress plainly, and the dormitories are extraordinarily simple and beautiful, forming a fashion. The teachers are all full-time and live with the students. The teachers in schools such as Tongren Zhicun have very low salaries, but they are full of spirit, leading the youth, and have a concept of regarding education as a sacred lifelong career, which is absolutely different from those in cities who calculate hours and salaries. The report of the League of Nations education observation group observes and criticizes our country's education with seriousness, which is not easy to fully understand without personally inspecting the local education situation. However, there is one point in the report, that is, the evaluation of the work of the Pingjiao Association in Dingxian, which seems to be inevitably biased. Because of the urgency of personal time, I did not have time to fully inspect the four major educations it advocates. However, in terms of women's art education and health education, its work is obviously not a waste, and the results are quite impressive. I once inspected the Pingmin Girls' School in Zong Sijun, only for a weekly meeting. The students' speeches and discussions, the use of words and expressions, are indeed quite trained, so it must not be judged by its appearance as a village girl and rejected from the door of modern education.</p>
<p>Tianjin used to be a municipality directly under the central government, but now it is an ordinary city. The education expenditure is 60,000 yuan per month, and no less than half of the children are out of school. There is one municipal normal school, but there are already one provincial male and one female normal school in the city. The city also sends two students to study in Europe and the United States, which is particularly inconsistent with the principle of financial economy. The allocation of secondary education funds in Hebei Province is too much for normal schools and too little for vocational schools. Normal schools used to be six years, but now they have been changed to three years. Many schools want to set up junior high schools to avoid budget cuts. Now, Director Chen has decided to allocate funds in accordance with the standards set by the ministry, and I sincerely hope that the responsible officials in the department will plan together and not have any fear of difficulty. All school principals should uphold the central government's intentions and not be afraid of making a new start, and progress can be expected. The local education funds in various counties of Hebei Province are not well-organized. The county heads in the interior counties are particularly irresponsible. When asked about the amount of education fees, most of them cannot answer. Moreover, almost every county has more than one rural normal school, and its expenditure rate is less than 5,000 yuan. The rural teachers feel struggling, while the county magistrate feels that it is not easy to develop primary school education. In the future, the establishment of rural teachers should be determined according to the local needs of teachers, and it is not necessary for every county to have a school, just to decorate the facade.

<p>The Pucheng University Basketball Team, the Korean Basketball Champion, arrived in Shanghai yesterday. It plans to play about five matches in Shanghai. It is found that the team has won the three major championships of the Korea Basketball Association, the Korea Sports Association, and the Gyeongseong YMCA between last year and this year. This year, it represented Korea in the All-Japan Basketball Tournament. In the semi-finals, it lost 40 to 46. Also, the University of Hawaii basketball team went to Japan and won a complete victory. When the team went to Korea to compete with Pucheng, Pucheng lost by only one point, with a score of 48 to 49. Looking at its history, it is enough to prove Pucheng's strength, which is indeed extraordinary. The team hosted reporters from various newspapers at the Tongxing Lou last night. According to the talks given by team leader Hong Seong-ha and coach Kim Young-geon (translated by Shen Guoquan and Han Kuiyong), "China and Korea have a historical relationship. However, political contact is not very free. We sincerely hope that we can hold hands and strengthen our friendship through sports. We also hope that your country's basketball team will come to our country to compete. Our country will treat them with the utmost sincerity. We previously invited Tianjin's strongest basketball team to compete in our country in August. However, it could not be realized due to your country's National Games, which is a pity. Now that our team is purely a university team, we plan to only play against university teams in your country. However, the competition is entrusted to the Sports Association of your country. There are matches against McLing and Xiqing, two Western teams, which are regrettable."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Times reported that there have been rumors recently that the Chinese Baseball Field, which is currently leased by the National Sports Association, will soon be converted into a school. Yesterday, the reporter learned from a reliable source that the association can continue to lease it until next spring, as the site is the property of the Rockefeller Foundation, which has been purchasing it since 1914, and the original cost has reached 298,000 US dollars, and the market price is even higher. It is currently being used as a sports field by the Sports Association with a small rent. Recently, discussions have been held on the use of the land in order to achieve the original purpose of the purchase, but according to reliable sources, the final decision still awaits New York, and the expected time is around April next year. The original purpose of the Rockefeller Foundation's purchase of the land was to establish a medical school. In the future, it will probably be relocated here by the National Medical College. The school was originally in Wusong, but it was destroyed in the Shanghai War of 1928. It is currently temporarily housed in the Red Cross Hospital.</p>

<p>Last night, only two Group A matches took place in the West Qing Basketball League. The Pirates defeated Zhizhi in a one-sided game, with a final score of 83-36. Jiangwan defeated St. John's in a closely contested match, 41-32.</p>
<p>Pirates Defeat Zhizhi: Initially, the Pirates were not in good form, and their lines were disorganized. Consequently, they were at a disadvantage when facing Zhizhi. However, Zhizhi's poor shooting accuracy, with only two successful shots out of nine attempts, allowed the Pirates to gain an advantage after six minutes, thanks to Smith's short throws. From then on, the Pirates' prowess gradually emerged, and their forwards remained calm and composed, making almost every shot. The first half ended with the Pirates leading 37-12. In the afternoon, Zhizhi remained unable to find a solution. Due to their smaller stature, their passing and interceptions were consistently outmaneuvered. Given the significant disparity in strength, the game proceeded smoothly without any surprises. The final result was 83-36.</p>

<p>Jiangwan Defeats St. John's: At the beginning of the match between Jiangwan and St. John's, both teams seemed unfamiliar with each other's strategies, resulting in some disarray. Jiangwan initially appeared anxious, with their guards committing frequent fouls and their forwards unable to score. Consequently, St. John's took the lead. However, after five minutes of intense play, Jiangwan's teamwork improved, allowing them to surpass St. John's. St. John's responded calmly and steadily advanced, eventually tying the score at 17-17. At this point, Jiangwan regained momentum, scoring through free throws and regular shots, ultimately winning the first half by a narrow margin of 22-17. The second half was even more tense. Jiangwan continued their momentum, scoring three consecutive baskets. St. John's fell behind and urgently adjusted their lineup, but their limited strength prevented them from turning the tide. In the end, Jiangwan won by a score of 41-32.</p>

<h3 id="e250">Shanghai Chinese and Western, Japanese Four YMCA's Launch an Organization to Train Sports Referees; Established Yesterday, Two Main Leaders Were Selected to Proceed Separately; Initially Training Basketball Referees, Gradually Expanding to Other Items <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai YMCA, Western Overseas Chinese YMCA, Maritime YMCA, and Japanese Overseas Chinese YMCA, recognizing that Shanghai's sports industry is becoming increasingly prosperous, but the lack of sports referees with correct ideas and the insufficient number of personnel have become practical problems. Therefore, the organization of training sports referees was jointly initiated. The main leaders of the four associations consulted with each other, and a meeting was held yesterday to establish the organization, determine the outline, and put it into practice, which has a profound relationship with the advancement of Shanghai's sports industry. The meeting process is briefly described as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e251">General Assembly Declares the Purpose <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, the four groups that initiated this movement each sent representatives to attend the meeting. Mr. Topin, the chairman, first stated the purpose of the initiation. Then, according to his understanding, this type of organization does not conflict with the Chinese Referee Association, and the most important point is how to train and how to test, so as to become a legal sports referee. All experienced referees and those who hope to become a referee can participate. If they pass the training and examination, they will get a formal certificate stamped by the four groups.</p>
<h3 id="e252">Divided into Two Departments to Proceed <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>All representatives made good contributions to the progress of the matter. Finally, it was decided to divide into two major departments and select members to be responsible for the proceeding. The first department is the procedure department, which plans the training steps, and is chaired by Ling Xitao, Topin, Kaizhi and others. The second department is the examination department, which plans the examination methods, and is chaired by Qian Yiqin, Hall, Spia, and others. Generally, participants will first undergo two weeks of training, and then take the exam. Currently, the first step is to train basketball referees, gradually expanding to other items.</p>

<h3 id="e253">The Doctor and the Physician <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Yanqiao</p>
<p>Northerners call doctors "Daifu" (大夫), roughly borrowing the title from the Imperial Hospital. Those outside the hospital take pride in this title, and patients, hoping the doctor will put in more effort, also offer this respectful address, which over time has become the exclusive term. It's similar to how Southerners call doctors "Langzhong" (郎中).</p>
<p>I find that titles are the hardest things to change, and certainly can't be affected simply by issuing an order. I remember after the success of the Xinhai Revolution, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, in the Generalissimo's Office, ordered that everyone be addressed as "Mister," removing terms like "Your Excellency" and other honorifics. But how long did it take for "Your Excellency" to be revived? After the success of the Northern Expedition during the National Revolution, everyone was again to be addressed as "Comrade." However, this term was only fully applicable within the same organization; in other organizations, there was a risk of it not being honored. As for the general public, they remained completely "stuck in the old ways," just as things were under the rule of the Aisin Gioro.</p>
<p>However, Southerners say "Langzhong" orally, but write "Yisheng" (醫生, doctor) on paper, unlike Northerners, whose spoken and written language match, with newspapers also using "Daifu" in advertisements. When we Southerners see this, we easily think of the "Daifu" listed on obituaries, following "Chao Yi Feng Zhi" (朝議奉直), giving us a sense of "still seeing the old official rituals." Moreover, the character "Da" (大) is pronounced like "Dai" (代), which also easily evokes the image of storytellers using "Great King" (大王), giving it a bit of a rough air. However, the "Daifu" Lu from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, who was terrified once by Zhuge Liang's arrow-borrowing with straw boats and again by Guan Yu's solo journey to the meeting, would find this "Taifu" (太夫) hard to be.</p>
<p>Materialists would say that whether it's "Daifu" or "Langzhong," the only thing that matters is the cure. That's why I saw that the school magazine of a certain university in Beiping still wrote "Please Mr. Daifu be the school doctor," combining "Daifu" and "school doctor" into one term, which I found very historically interesting.</p>
<h3 id="e254">Getting Better <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Zuizhu</p>
<p>The phrase "Getting Better" is of course an auspicious expression. After a severe illness, the dangerous signs recede, and one is not doomed to be a dead man. This is one kind of "Getting Better."</p>
<p>Friendships sour, and there's talk of breaking ties. Through mediation, suspicions gradually dissipate. This is a second kind of "Getting Better."</p>
<p>A prodigal son turns back, studying and cultivating virtue. The family fortune declines, but he strives and works hard. Reviving what's declining and overcoming fatigue, gradually reaching a better state. This is a third kind of "Getting Better."</p>
<p>Examples like the above, in every aspect, are plentiful if you look for them using the principle of "a slap followed by a sweet."</p>
<p>China, a country with a great nation's demeanor and educated by ancient sages and worthies, values "not dwelling on past grievances." So, if someone receives a "spicy slap" from another, as long as they endure the momentary pain, they won't hold it against them; as the saying goes, "Great men don't remember the faults of small men." As for dwarfs, short people, and barbarians, there's even less point in teaching them, as it's not worth losing one's "gentlemanly demeanor." Don't say that children are ignorant and reckless, relying on love to offend superiors, which shouldn't be held against them; even if they intentionally offend, one should uphold the principle of compassion, pitying their ignorance and self-imposed guilt. Therefore, "offer the other cheek after being slapped on the left" is the only way to be worthy of being a great sage. Lou Shide's "letting saliva dry on his face" falls far short.</p>
<p>If people can think this way, not only will the slap not hurt, but it can also fully create a "disciple of sages," making one feel glorious and deeply grateful for the other person's act of completing one's virtue with a slap. The pain is worth mentioning, and there's certainly no hatred. One must know that the level of civilization of other countries is indeed somewhat lacking. They are straightforward, "good is good, bad is bad," and can't be as flexible and adaptable as the Chinese. Because of this, the "Getting Better" that can't be seen in other countries is especially common in China. This can be considered a source of pride for China, right?</p>
<h3 id="e255">Talking in One's Sleep <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Yan</p>
<p>Once, I had a dream in which my good friend C suddenly committed suicide by jumping into the river due to a love affair. Fortunately, a sailor from a certain country was nearby and managed to save him from the river. This dream was very ordinary, but at that time, C was having a disagreement with his lover for some reason, and there was a possibility that my dream would become a reality. Determined to do something, the next day I went to his office to find him and told him the dream I had the night before, not only in great detail but also repeatedly using warning tones to sting him, implying that I was advising him to quickly bow his head and surrender to the lady. Whether he actually did so, I dare not say for sure, but C is still alive and well, and has not actually jumped into the Huangpu River, and his love affair is still ongoing. Only, every time I see him, I can't help but say to him, "Be careful not to jump into the Huangpu," and his reply is always, "Don't talk in your sleep."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, one day, he said his usual "Don't talk in your sleep" too loudly, which made me very uncomfortable, and we started with joking and ended up in a formal debate. But thanks to this debate, I developed a new understanding out of nowhere and used this new understanding to refute C until he was speechless. From then on, although I still teased him from time to time, "Be careful not to jump into the Huangpu," he no longer used the words "Don't talk in your sleep" as a reply.</p>
<p>I said, "Friend, don't think that there is a huge difference between dreams and reality, and don't take dreams too lightly. I'll just ask you two things: For example, getting rich is not an easy thing. Although you sincerely worship thrift and expanding income, and even don't hesitate to change all kinds of methods to try to get money, but facts tell us that ten people who want to get rich often fail together. It is true that getting rich in reality is not an easy thing. However, if you want to have a dream of getting rich tonight, can you guarantee that you will have this dream tonight? Of course not. Then the difficulty of dreaming is no less than that of reality. Secondly, I will ask you again what you did yesterday. Suppose you kissed a certain lady yesterday, but can you still keep this kiss today? Can you use any evidence to convince people that you kissed her yesterday? Isn't it just like dreaming, leaving some memorable impressions only in your own brain? People can also ridicule you for talking in your sleep, how can you guarantee what kind of result your kiss yesterday will produce in the future? Therefore, yesterday's facts are equal to dreams today. The facts that happened a minute or a second ago are also equal to dreams afterwards. Then what is the difference between recounting past facts or recounting dreams?"</p>

<p>— Yiqiu</p>
<p>She unbuttoned her clothes and put her nipple into the young master's mouth. She gently pinched her full breast with two fingers, and the little mouth could be heard "gulping" as it sucked her milk.</p>
<p>Her heart was filled with inexplicable sadness, and she said nothing, just staring blankly at a corner of the floor. "My milk cannot feed my own child: to be sucked by others: abandoned: my own flesh and blood: to raise someone else's child: they had children: they want someone else to feed them: I really want to feed my own child: I can't: away from my lovely hometown: to see terrible strange faces here:"</p>
<p>As she kept thinking like this, a gust of autumn wind seemed to carry the sound of a child crying from afar, "Ah: my darling! How are you now?" She couldn't bear the encirclement of this desolate image, and two teardrops fell miserably.</p>
<p>The young mistress walked past her and noticed the tear stains. She went back to her room, saw the "Old Huang Mama," and casually asked, "Why is the nanny crying?" Huang Mama said, "New nannies are always like this. Wasn't I like this when I first came out to help people? It's probably because they are new to the world and not worldly enough."</p>
<p>Sure enough, a year later, she gradually realized that this was a very natural thing, and she gradually realized that there were different "fates" among "people," so she lived a nanny life very contentedly.</p>

<p>Chapter 20: Divination Brings Happiness, Old Man Smiles for Days; Endless Relief from Sorrow, Old Friends Live Across the Street</p>
<p>Madam Jiang said, "If you want to ask, but don't let me speak, I won't say it. I still need to go out." As she spoke, she took down a wooden box that was stacked on the kang, checked seven or eight pieces of clothing fabric inside, put them on the kang, wrapped them in an old bundle, and then moved the box back to its original place. When she climbed down from the kang, she saw Guizhi holding the bundle with her hands behind her back. Putting it behind her, she asked with a smile: "Where are you planning to take these fabrics?" Madam Jiang said, "I should give them to someone to make them, right?" Guizhi said, "You're so muddled, just hand them over to the tailor, and if they don't fit properly, it's not a big deal if the fabric is ruined, but if I don't like it, you'll say I'm nagging again." Madam Jiang said, "I was worried you wouldn't care. If you're willing to care, that's great, it'll save me from being worried and not meeting your expectations." Guizhi said, "I don't understand this. Why shouldn't I care about making my own clothes?" Her mother was afraid that she wouldn't care about the reason, and she really understood it, deliberately saying this to show that her heart was very calm, so she opened the bundle, took out only one piece of clothing fabric, wrapped it in a large silk handkerchief, and said to herself: "I'm also waiting to have clothes to wear, let Wang the Tailor make a rough piece first and try it out." Madam Jiang was also born as a maiden, knowing that maidens always have a kind of wanting to ask but not asking attitude towards their wedding clothes, so the mother can only vaguely act as a consultant, otherwise the maiden will become angry and ashamed. Because of this, Madam Jiang sat on the side, pretending nothing had happened. Guizhi also seemed to feel a little awkward about this matter. She stood in the house for a while, tidied up the things on the table, and saw that her mother didn't say anything, so she picked up the silk handkerchief package and walked out the door calmly. When she reached the door, she looked towards both ends of the street. Only then did she lower her head and walk step by step along the base of the wall. After walking halfway down the alley, she suddenly heard someone behind her calling out: "Miss, I haven't seen you for a long time, have you gone to the city to play again these few days?" (272)</p>
<h3 id="e258">Family Handicrafts <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— Yan BOGuang</p>
<p>The Chinese family economy has always been solely borne by men, so there is an ancient saying, "It's hard for a hero to feed three mouths." We live in a modern society with an overpopulation. It is already very difficult to find a job, so where can you talk about thick or thin wages? If you are not willing to do it, someone will do it. So the Europeans and Americans once said this: It is not easy to find a thousand dogs in China immediately, but it is not difficult to gather a thousand people. It can be seen that the number of unemployed people is alarming! And the standard of living is so high. Women should do some small handicrafts in the family to earn some money to make up for the insufficient family expenses, so that your good man does not bear the burden alone. This is something that virtuous women will definitely be happy to hear. Today, I will introduce a few of them below. I hope you will work hard to produce and make your family economy more and more prosperous every day!</p>
<p>Snow Cream Making Method: Snow cream is the most popular in winter, and its sales are also very large. As long as you go to the material store to buy some bottles and go to the printing office to print some posters, the manufacturing method is very simple. Or make some bulk snow cream and put it in various cigarette paper stores for consignment sales, or wholesale it to barber shops. The resulting surplus profits are not small for the family economy. Its raw material blending method:</p>
<p>Stearin (you must buy the best, inferior products have a buttery smell.) Eight taels.</p>
<p>Sodium Carbonate, eight qian.</p>
<p>Filtered Water, twenty-five taels.</p>
<p>Glycerin, six taels.</p>
<p>Fragrance, eight qian or one tael. (Rose essence, jasmine essence, magnolia essence are all acceptable.)</p>
<p>The above are sold in Shanghai industrial raw material shops, or pharmacies. Its manufacturing method: First put the sodium carbonate into the filtered water and stir it with a stick to dissolve it. Use another enamel pot to crush the stearin and put it in the pot. Heat it over low heat. The heat should not be too high. It is best to prepare a Fahrenheit table and insert the mercury end to test it. About one hundred sixty or seventy degrees is the most suitable. After it is completely dissolved, pour the sodium carbonate water in six or seven times (about twenty-five taels of water dissolving sodium carbonate.) Each time you pour it in, it will cause an alkaline reaction. At first, it is dispersed due to being cold, and then it is alkalized by being heated again, until the alkaline liquid is finished (that is, sodium carbonate water.) At this time, the whole has already changed from a thin paste to a thick paste. At this time, stirring must be non-stop. After the water vapor is slightly evaporated, add glycerin and continue stirring. When the heat is slightly removed, add the essence. At this time, the golden body is cooled, and it changes from a thin body to a thick knot. At that time, the snow cream is complete, so divide it into bottles and put it for three or four days, and it will naturally reveal its brilliance and the fragrance is rich. Every winter, I always have to do it several times to prepare for the customers to buy separately. According to the above method, the snow cream must be very good.</p>
<p>Honey Cream Making Method: Honey cream is a blessing to the common people in winter. If you wipe it on, you can avoid chapped skin, and the capital is not large, and the method is easy. Like clam shell honey cream and tin box honey cream, the sales are very large. Its raw materials are:</p>
<p>White Vaseline, one tael.</p>
<p>Talcum Powder, six qian.</p>
<p>Candelilla Red Powder, appropriate amount. (Sold in paint stores.)</p>
<p>Rose Oil, appropriate amount.</p>
<p>Heat the Vaseline over low heat until it is melted. Add talcum powder, mix well, and add candelilla red powder to make a concubine color, or you can use all white without candelilla red powder. Remove from heat, mix in rose oil, and put it into the box while it is flowing. When it is cold, it will condense into a very good honey cream.</p>

<p>American Official Buys Gold, Price Trends Upward; Gold Market Sees Slight Setback; Hedging Activities Remain Stable; Fluctuations Result in a Fall of $3.3</p>
<p>Yesterday's gold market saw a sudden rise in the price of raw gold due to American official purchases, leading to an increase in exchange rates. The overall situation for the day was difficult to invigorate.

<p>After the flour market opened in the morning, the situation for each month showed a trend of falling first and then stabilizing. Foreign wheat quotations all continued to be about a dime lower. At the opening, most people's hearts were uniformly sluggish, and the market atmosphere was desolate. Because this month must be delivered soon, non-industry floating longs have closed out one after another, and the market has become exceptionally loose. The lowest point fell to 1 jiao, 4 fen, 2.5 li, a drop of 2.5 fen compared to the previous day. January and February also fell more than 2 fen, while distant months fell by less than 1 fen. Later, because the factories did not exit, and the Tianjin merchants had some business, there was a slight recovery. When the afternoon market opened, because the Tianjin spot quotation did not decrease, the troopship sold for $2.3334, claiming that current sales were very active, and the handling appetite was quite greedy, so the near and distant months were also brought to stability, and it was nearly slightly better than the morning. As a result, this month was 7.5 li lower than the previous day, January to March did not move, April was 5 li better, and May was 7.5 li better.</p>
<p>The wheat market situation, after the morning and afternoon openings, the situation for each month showed a trend of near months falling and distant months stabilizing. Although the foreign wheat quotation was only a dime lower, it had little to do with recent months. However, because the delivery is near this month, the factories, after the first batch of borrowed wheat arrives, can meet the temporary needs, so whether the standard of this month is to be received is still difficult to predict at present, so although the transaction is lonely and few, people's hearts have greatly loosened, and this month has fallen to $4.15, a drop of 8 fen compared to the previous day. January's hearts are still fixed, only falling 1 fen. February initially fell 2 or 3 fen, but later because of covering shorts, people's hearts rallied, and reversed by 1 fen. Current wheat is still both arriving and selling in desolation, and the factory appetite has not moved, so there is no transaction.</p>

<p>Yesterday's yellow beans continued the trend from the previous day, causing goods holders to eagerly sell cheaply, and fatigue continued for two or three points. However, high-quality goods are fixed in the market due to scarcity. In terms of export sales, good beans have some transactions. Factories do not take unless they are cheap. The shops in this street choose the right things and buy them, and the intake is average. Approximately seven or eight vehicles of various beans were traded in the market. Fortunately, the source is not connected, and the market shape will not be too humiliated. The arrival and sales of Du beans are rare and meet, and the market is quite firm and stable. Shahuang is flat and tired.</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market, although Customs Gold increased, the listed gold turned down, and the trend was still tired. The association drew a plate of 24 coarse sand white ordinary goods and drew 19 yuan, 7 jiao, 7 points, which was eight points less than the previous day, and the transit goods were five points less, at six yuan and nine jiao. The transit goods of the 8th and 9th Haochi were still six yuan and nine jiao. Taikoo Sugar B Mark was twenty yuan, two jiao and a half, and CW Mark was twenty yuan and one jiao, all unmoved. Zhenji No. 1 cotton white was eighteen yuan and nine jiao, also without rise or fall, the rest are refunded. New Tide Green continued to open more than 500 packs yesterday, a sharp drop of eight or nine jiao compared to the previous plate, accounting for 14 yuan, 4 jiao for Tizhuang Green, and 14 yuan, 2 jiao for Huanggang Green, and 14 yuan to 13 yuan, 8 jiao for the next. The market for Pianqing is still fixed. Yesterday, the Guangzhou merchants opened hundreds of boxes again, and the price was still ten yuan. Wufu Bai Bing has been out of stock for many days. Yesterday, I heard that more than 200 boxes have been transported, because the top-grade in the market is missing, the number plate called for an increase of two 角, but it has not yet become a plate.</p>

<p>(Silk factory industry is precarious) European and American silk sales have plummeted, and the silk factory industry in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai has fallen into desperation. It is estimated that the silk stored in various ports has reached more than 10,000 dan, and the cocoons stored have exceeded 70,000 or 80,000 dan. Most of them are mortgaged to the financial sector, and the total silk and cocoon mortgages have reached 10 million. In the blink of an eye, the end of the year is approaching, and the silk factory industry is precarious due to the inability to repay and imminent bankruptcy.</p>
<p>(Double Palace silk sales are increasingly sluggish) Recently, the sales of Double Palace silk have become more and more sluggish. Only India has a slightly smaller appetite, and the British post office only exported 400 bales of Double Palace silk last week. The current sales are completely stagnant.</p>
<p>(Artificial silk customer sales turn clear) As the end of the year approaches, inland silk merchants' appetite for artificial silk has turned dull. Yesterday, only Hangzhou silk merchants entered 22 boxes of Feima, Yishu Sanqi, and other brands of current futures, and the price ranged from 175.75 yuan to 160 yuan net.</p>
<p>(Foreign silk dealers hold firm) The European and American markets are flooded with Japanese silk, and the current silk price in New York is difficult to rise. The price of French silk in Lyon is high and no one asks about it. The dispatches from Shanghai are still not turning around. Although Chinese silk merchants are eager to sell due to the accumulation of silk near the end of the year, the current selling price is not enough to cover the principal and interest of the mortgage, and they are willing to put the stored silk on hold and suspend business to wait for a turnaround next year. Therefore, the market atmosphere is holding firm and there is no news of current silk transactions. The future of the silk industry is becoming increasingly dangerous.</p>
<h3 id="e282">The Decline of Chinese Tea Sales in America <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>Chinese tea trade with America saw brisk sales and rising prices from August to October. However, recently, in the New York market, various types of green tea from the Ping Shui region of China, including Ma Zhu, Zhi Zhu, Zhen Mei, and Feng Mei teas, have experienced a sudden stagnation in sales. Merchants have accumulated a large stock of over 40,000 boxes. According to observations from tea merchants, the recent decline in American sales is due to the lifting of the alcohol ban in the United States, which has led to a surge in coffee sales. Furthermore, the massive import of Taiwanese and Japanese teas, sold at low prices, has contributed to the downturn.</p>

<p>The demand for genuine horsehair sleeve linings has increased significantly due to the popularity of lined overcoats, resulting in brisk sales. Prices have risen several times. Currently, domestic brands like "Dao Hua" are producing these linings day and night. Additionally, small-scale yarn and wool weaving factories in Shanghai, attracted by the potential profits, are also manufacturing similar products, leading to a sudden increase in supply and a slight dampening of the market. The price increases for imported goods have ceased. Yesterday, wholesale prices for imported genuine horsehair sleeve linings were uniformly one dollar and sixty-five cents (in foreign currency), domestic "Dao Hua" goods were one dollar and thirty-five cents, and products from miscellaneous small factories were priced at one dollar and twenty-five cents per yard.</p>

<p>A new shipment of 35-pound thin tinplate, which had been out of stock for several days, arrived yesterday. The asking price is fifty-six dollars per box. Transactions have been made with biscuit factories and cigarette companies, with over eighty boxes reportedly sold. Furthermore, merchant guilds from Tianjin, Hankou, and other regions have also inquired about it, so the market remains stable.</p>
<p>The demand for 27- and 28-gauge thick tinplate has been particularly strong recently from lantern factories. As a result, daily transactions have totaled two to three hundred dan (a unit of weight). The price is twenty-eight dollars per box (200 pounds). However, the inventory of old stock is extremely low, and new shipments are scarce, resulting in a robust market. Additionally, lock companies, coppersmiths, and other trades also have a need for it, making the market outlook very optimistic.</p>

<h3 id="e285">The Ancient City Meeting <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>"The Ancient City Meeting" is a well-known old opera featuring a black-faced character and a red-faced character arguing (please forgive an outsider for speaking like an outsider). I recently watched this play again at the Xianxia Society and suddenly thought of Mr. So-and-so's speech about restoring old virtues. I felt that this fixed-form morality, performed and interpreted by millions of people, should be at the forefront of any restoration.</p>
<p>The black-faced third brother had always admired and obeyed the red-faced second brother. However, on this occasion, he became highly suspicious, practically denying the red-faced brother's character. It was as if a prostitute who had already sold herself was shouting about chastity in the hands of her pimp, rendering it worthless. In the black-faced brother's eyes, the high position and generous salary offered by the Prime Minister's side had long captivated the red-faced brother's soul. The sworn brotherhood in the Peach Garden had been completely forgotten. How could someone who had gained the Prime Minister's favor still be willing to travel a thousand miles to return to Liu Bei? Therefore, refusing to open the gate was perfectly reasonable.</p>
<p>From our perspective as later generations, while the red-faced character is admirable, we can't help but laugh at his foolishness. If he had bowed down to the Prime Minister, he could have had wealth and women as he wished, enjoying great happiness. Returning to Liu Bei's side meant facing wind, frost, rain, and snow, a life of wandering and hardship. Rejecting "happiness" for "hardship" is something that at least the officials and scholars of today would never do. The various associations in Chinese lower society admire this red-faced hero who refused to serve the Prime Minister. If we want to find people of integrity, we should look among the lower classes. The ancients said that trustworthiness and righteousness were practiced by "gentlemen," but the term "gentleman" deserves careful consideration.</p>
<p>In the "Peach Blossom Fan" play, Ruan Da Yue instructs his servant to go to Jiming Dai to inquire about what the members of the Restoration Society thought of his critique of Yanzi Jian. When he heard them say, "A true talent, with an extraordinary pen, his writing is heavenly, an immortal exiled to the human world," his heart blossomed. But when he heard them say, "Why did he surrender to Cui and Wei, destroying himself?" he could only frown and sigh, "It's just this little bit of lack of talent; there's no need to talk about it anymore!" "There's no need to talk about it anymore" is something only officials and scholars would say. If the red-faced character said that, the black-faced character wouldn't buy it.</p>
<p>Even today, I would very much like to advocate for the old virtues, such as the ancient morality of "The Ancient City Meeting." However, who is qualified to advocate for this ancient morality is something to consider carefully. I fear nothing else but that the black-faced character will firmly refuse to open the gate, negating the red-faced character's integrity!</p>
<h3 id="e286">Conditions for Translating Famous Works <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— Kanran</p>
<p>At a time when young people feel there are no books to read and lack spiritual nourishment, and when several large bookstores are focused on competing in the textbook market and unwilling to publish translated works, the Zhongshan Cultural and Educational Center's proposal to systematically translate Western classics is naturally very exciting.</p>
<p>Originally, systematically introducing Western classics requires significant capital. It is appropriate for the Zhongshan Cultural and Educational Center, with the help of the government and private individuals and sufficient funding, to undertake this major cultural endeavor. It is said that the Center plans to pay translators five yuan per thousand words and also allow them to collect royalties upon publication. With such conditions, I believe good translation results should be achieved.</p>
<p>However, systematically introducing world classics is not easy. Even with substantial financial resources, it must be handled properly. If done well, it will have a great and positive impact on our culture. Otherwise, it will not only waste money but also further tarnish the already chaotic translation field in the eyes of the world. Therefore, from a purely academic standpoint, I cannot help but offer some suggestions:</p>
<p>First, the selected classics must undergo careful scrutiny. Western classics are vast and boundless. Limited by manpower and financial resources, we must carefully select them after weighing their importance. I believe:</p>
<p>(1) Since it is a systematic introduction, we should select classics that have already received historical acclaim. Contemporary works should be selected sparingly.</p>
<p>(2) We should seek works from countries with deep European cultural roots. Newly emerging countries like Japan and the United States have few world-class scholars worthy of mention, so their works should be selected sparingly or not at all.</p>
<p>(3) Important works, even if they have already been translated, should be retranslated if the existing translation is not satisfactory.</p>
<p>(4) Truly valuable classics should be translated, even if it is known that few people will read them.</p>
<p>In short, the selection of classics requires gathering many specialized scholars with a deep understanding of Western culture to discuss them thoroughly. We do not know which classics the Center has already decided to translate, or which scholars selected the titles being translated. However, we have seen the list of review committee members in the newspapers. Unfortunately, while many of these members are highly respected figures, few have a deep understanding of Western culture. Some may not even understand any foreign languages. I believe the organizers need to add and remove members from this list.</p>
<p>Second, the translation of classics must strive for perfection. Translating classics should be a very serious matter. Since the Center has substantial financial resources, it should be able to obtain perfect translations. Failure to do so would not only mislead readers but also disrespect the Western sages who painstakingly wrote these works. To ensure perfect translations, I believe:</p>
<p>First, we must hire specialists with expertise in both Chinese and Western cultures to undertake the translations. Translating classics requires not only selecting people with extensive translation experience and excellent command of both Chinese and Western languages but also people who have specialized knowledge of the work they are translating. It would be inappropriate to have someone who studies engineering translate economic history, or to have someone who only knows how to translate novels translate AugComte's *Cours de Philosophie Positive*, a work of profound philosophy.</p>
<p>Second, classics must be translated from the original language. We know that no matter how good a translation is, it is always a significant step down from the original. This is especially true for philosophical works, where even the slightest error can lead to significant misinterpretations. In the past, China lacked translators, and many works from Germany and France were translated indirectly from English or Japanese, inevitably leading to errors from the initial translators. Now that there are many people proficient in German and French, there is no reason to continue using indirect translation methods.</p>
<p>I have many other personal opinions, but due to space limitations, I cannot present them all. Most importantly, I hope the Center will approach this translation of world classics with a determination to serve culture and sacrifice for scholarship, without any intention of profiting or pursuing other aims. Printing and distribution can be entrusted to bookstores, but the selection of classics must not be influenced by bookstores. Otherwise, there is a risk of being swayed by the desire for sales and catering to the market, neglecting truly valuable classics in favor of second- or third-rate Western works or recently published, ephemeral works from Japan or the United States for speculative gain. Let me reiterate: the success or failure of the Center's translation of world classics has a tremendous impact on the future of Chinese culture. Not only should the organizers take it seriously, but the entire writing and reading community in China should pay close attention to it.</p>
<h3 id="e287">Nalan Chengde's Poetic Theories (Continued) <a href="#e287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>Nalan Chengde's unique feature of his poetic theory is his anti-imitation stance. Like many poets, he advocates creativity, advocating that each era should have poetry adapted to that era. In his jottings, he used great effort to oppose the tendency to imitate, providing various proofs from a theoretical and phonological standpoint. In general, he says: "The study of ancient poetry is like an infant who cannot do without a wet nurse. Only after standing on one's own can poetry be formed, just as only after standing on one's own can one become an adult. Those in the Ming dynasty who studied Du Fu and the High Tang spent their entire lives being fed at the wet nurse’s breast."</p>
<p>The metaphor of "spending one’s days at the wet nurse's breast" is apt. In another passage, he poses the question, "Regulated verse is a recent form. Its opening, introduction, transition, and conclusion are similar to the style of the eight-legged essay, except without the introductory, supporting, and explanatory paragraphs. Ancient verse, however, (there seems to be something missing here, or perhaps it's a duplicated phrase) is like the essays of Ou and Su, endlessly changing. Those who write eight-legged essays mostly dare not presumptuously write ancient prose, but those who write regulated verse all attempt to write ancient verse. Is this permissible?" It is evident that these imitationists exhibit contradictions even within themselves and lack a unified understanding. Regarding phonology, Nalan Chengde says:</p>
<p>"The greatest harm to poetry today comes from writing rhyming verse. There was a slight tendency for this among Tang poets in the middle and late periods, and it became prevalent in the Song dynasty, hence the Yuan dynasty's compilation of the *Yunfu Qunyu* [a rhyming dictionary]. Today, poetry without rhyming verse is considered unusual! If one's poetry cannot rival that of one's predecessors, and one further binds one's own hands to face the enemy, that is an extreme miscalculation! I once said this to a friend, and he replied, 'People today are merely composing rhymes; who is composing poetry?' This statement is crucial and must be feared. If people do not abandon this illness, they will not produce good poetry." At the same time, in another passage, he also says, "When people compose poetry, they must base it on the *Three Hundred Poems*, but they do not follow its rhyming scheme. Is this not a reversal?" Just as in the general aspect, he points out the dead-end nature of imitationism as a form of "suicide," and in this phonological imitation, he similarly reveals its contradictory nature and advocates for breaking down this approach.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>If he opposes imitationism, then what are Nalan Chengde's positive views on poetry? Based on the *Lushuiting Miscellaneous Records*, his views can be said to have two main targets: one is "expressing emotions," and the other is "expressing sentiments [寄託]." Regarding "expressing emotions," Nalan Chengde says:</p>
<p>"The *qu* style arose and lyrics declined, lyrics arose and poetry declined, Tang style arose and ancient poetry declined. The purpose of writing poetry is to express emotions. Living in the present era, recent forms are sufficient to express emotions. Scholars who admire the ancients lack those emotions and forcefully imitate the style to create ancient *yuefu* [ballads], which feels pointless."</p>
<p>This is similar to his statement that "poetry is the voice of the heart, a matter of temperament and emotions." In understanding, it is also similar to what Yu Quyuan later said: "Poetry that can enter the heart and spleen is a good work." His meaning is that poetry should not be imitation but should be the absolutely free expression of one's own feelings. Therefore, he says:</p>
<p>"People's feelings favor the new. Today, there is suddenly a fad for Song poetry. Those who wish to use scholarship to seek official positions are controlled by others, so they must follow others' steps. Poetry is for self-enjoyment; why should one follow others?"</p>
<p>"Poetry is for self-enjoyment; why should one follow others?" This insight is very incisive. "Expressing sentiments [寄託]" of course means "having content," having a definite theme. Connecting the two, Nalan Chengde's view is that poetry should have substantial new content and rich, genuine emotions. He says:</p>
<p>"The intention of Tang poets is not necessarily within the title, nor even within the poem itself, hence it is lofty and profound. Even when writing poems on objects, they must have sentiments to express and not create dead phrases. Today, when people discuss poetry, they are afraid that even a single word will stray from the title. This is good prose, not poetry."</p>
<p>This is just like his statement that "Tang poets have sentiments to express, so their use of allusion is skillful; later generations have no sentiments to express, so their use of allusion is rigid," advocating that poetry should have content and sentiments to express. In his jottings, he not only points this out in principle but also cites the poetry of Du Fu, Cao Tang, Han Wo, Liu Yuxi, Wu Yuanheng, and others as evidence.</p>
<h3 id="e288">Two Brothers (64) <a href="#e288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Mo Pasan (Maupassant), Li Weike</p>
<p>She had decorated this bedroom with all of a mother's love. The walls were covered with linen from Rouen, imitating ancient Normandy fabrics. A Louis XV bed, an armchair carved with irises and doves' beaks on the arms, filled the walls and furniture with a charming rustic flavor.</p>
<p>"Ah! It's beautiful," said Mrs. Lu, looking slightly serious as she entered the room.</p>
<p>"Do you like the house?" Zhe'an asked her.</p>
<p>"I like it very much."</p>
<p>"You know how happy I am to hear that."</p>
<p>They gazed at each other with affectionate eyes.</p>
<p>However, she felt slightly awkward and somewhat confused in this bedroom, which would become her marital chamber. She noticed upon entering that the bed was extremely large, definitely a bed for a married couple. Mrs. Luo Lan had chosen this bed, and she certainly expected and hoped that her son would soon realize his marriage plans. This thoughtfulness on the part of the mother pleased her greatly, as it was tantamount to saying that this family was waiting for her.</p>
<p>Later, when everyone returned to the living room, Zhe'an suddenly opened the door on the left, and everyone saw the circular dining room with three windows and Japanese lanterns. Mother and son had used all their ingenuity to decorate this room. With its bamboo furniture, porcelain dolls, colorful pottery, brocades, transparent curtains adorned with raindrop-like glass beads, fans attached to the walls to absorb the wallpaper, and all the porcelain, wooden, paper, ivory, mother-of-pearl, and bronze trinkets, the room had an affectation and pretense born of insensitivity, lack of taste, or the clumsy blindness of the artistically uneducated. However, it was the room everyone admired the most. Bi Er made a few less-than-complimentary remarks with a slightly bitter mockery, and his younger brother immediately felt displeased.</p>
<p>Fruit was piled on the table like pyramids, and desserts were piled high.</p>
<p>But no one was hungry at all; they just sipped on some fruit and tasted the desserts. After almost an hour, Mrs. Lu got up to say goodbye.</p>
<p>Luo Lan the Elder decided to take her to her doorstep and set off with her immediately. As for Mrs. Luo Lan, because the maid was not there, she had to look around the house to make sure her son didn't lack anything.</p>
<p>"Shall I come back to pick you up?" Luo Lan the Elder asked.</p>
<p>She hesitated for a moment, then replied:</p>
<p>"No, you go back to sleep. Bi Er will take me back."</p>
<p>After he left, she blew out the candle, put the desserts, candies, and various liqueurs in the cabinet, locked it, and handed the key to Zhe'an. Then she went into the bedroom, uncovered the quilt, checked if the water jug was full of ice water, and made sure the windows were closed.</p>
<p>Bi Er and Zhe'an stayed in the small living room. Zhe'an was still displeased because his older brother had criticized his taste, and Bi Er became increasingly angry as he watched his younger brother live in this house.</p>
<p>They both sat smoking without speaking. Bi Er suddenly stood up and said:</p>
<p>"That widow looked tired tonight. The excursion didn't make her look any better."</p>
<p>Zhe'an suddenly felt the sudden rage of a heartbroken weakling.</p>
<p>He was so angry he couldn't breathe. He stammered:</p>
<p>"I won't allow you to call Mrs. Lu a 'widow' when you speak of her again!"</p>
<p>Bi Er turned to him and said arrogantly:</p>
<p>"You seem to be giving me orders. Are you crazy?"</p>

<h3 id="e289">Scientific Inventions and Control <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— Lizhai</p>
<p>Whenever we mention science, we inevitably think of the two figures of modern times who have contributed the most to human life: one is Edison, who invented the light bulb, telephone, and phonograph and was hailed as the "Conqueror of the World's Mysteries," who passed away two years ago, and the other is Marconi, who invented the radio and recently visited Shanghai.</p>
<p>Originally, the history of mankind is the history of two-legged animals struggling to conquer nature with reason and technology. Any great scientist or inventor is first and foremost a great teacher who uses extraordinary genius, painstaking thought, and difficult experiments to guide mankind to conquer nature, thereby earning universal adoration. The reason why Edison's death was mourned worldwide and why Marconi's visit to China was met with fervent and sincere welcome is because of this.</p>
<p>Modern science has reached the stage where sound, light, chemistry, and electricity are controlled with ease, but in the vast and endless universe, we humans do not know how far we are from completely conquering and controlling nature. Therefore, for the sake of a richer life and greater happiness for mankind, we still need many future scientists and inventors to create even greater and more brilliant chapters in the history of mankind. However, familiar with the weaknesses and sins of mankind, we must add here in extra-large letters: While we certainly need more scientists and countless future inventions, we especially need to transfer the control of all science from the hands of a few imperialists and wealthy magnates to the majority of mankind! This righteous and stern statement can be explained from the following points:</p>
<p>First, in the past painful history of the European War and the current mad preparations for a second world war, all imperialists are desperately concentrating the application of science on the path of human massacre. As a result, science, which was originally intended to increase human happiness, has become a terrible weapon for a few ambitious people to abuse the human race. For example, the rapid development of bacteriology was originally the greatest progress in medicine, but in the hands of imperialists, various bacteria that are most likely to harm life have become disguised shells. In addition, the use of radio to spy on other countries' military and political secrets in order to prepare for war, the use of electricity to torture political prisoners, and the use of chemistry to manufacture poisonous gas are all caused by the control of politics and science by a few ambitious people. Therefore, to make science the science of humanity and not a "weapon of murder," we must seize control of science from the hands of a few international individuals and return it to the majority of mankind!</p>
<p>Second, precisely because imperialism used science to massacre more than eight million soldiers, create tens of millions of widows and orphans, and destroy countless people's wealth in the European War, many "metaphysical ghosts" and idealists seized the opportunity to pontificate after the war, saying that "science caused the evils of the European War," advocating that mankind should "talk less about science" and pay more attention to "spiritual life." This kind of sermon, on the one hand, is to exonerate the few people who control science from the responsibility of the war, and on the other hand, it is to slander science and scientists with "false accusations." Therefore, to truly benefit mankind, politically-minded scientists would never want the scientific contributions they have wrung their brains and spent their blood on to continue to be controlled and used by a few as weapons to create human tragedies or evils. Because it is a matter of gnashing teeth for every scientist that a few people steal the "key to human happiness" from the scientist's laboratory and use it as a "weapon of evil."</p>
<p>Third, as far as our China is concerned, the vast majority of wealthy gentry, masters, and madams do not know how to correctly</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>utilize science. People use the radio to broadcast noble music, send important news, and convey academic ideas in lectures, while Chinese madams and gentlemen install broadcasting machines to "fulfill vows" by broadcasting the Diamond Sutra or the Heart Sutra, or install radios to "enjoy" "crying marvelous...Duye"! Therefore, if the control is not in the right hands, things related to science, even in China, are not necessarily of much benefit to ordinary people!</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to extend my full respect to Mr. Marconi, the inventor of the radio, who recently visited China. At the same time, to sincerely respect science, I also extend the curse of "when will you perish" to the few who control science and use it to create evil!</p>

<p>— Of</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, Shanghai newspapers carried a Reuter's telegram from Guangzhou with a decorative border: "A soldier who lost a leg in the Shanghai war bought a single shoe from a shoe store. The owner refused, leading to a beating. He was then taken to court and sentenced: Shoes must be bought in pairs. If only one shoe is bought, the store owner is right to refuse."</p>
<p>Among the Chinese soldiers who have fought in civil wars for more than twenty years, the number of crippled and amputated wounded is, of course, countless. Wounded soldiers causing trouble in various places has also become a common and uncontrollable phenomenon. Precisely because there are so many of them that they cannot be counted, precisely because it is universally uncontrollable, people have probably become accustomed to it and have not paid serious attention to it. The one-legged soldier in the Reuter's telegram was once an "anti-Japanese hero" who fought fiercely against the Japanese "Imperial Army" in Shanghai. In terms of merit, he should not be inferior to the "Cai Tingkai" and others. The country and the people should treat this disabled brother who fought in the "national war" with special consideration and provide him with considerable convenience and preferential treatment in his life. But unfortunately, the country is too chaotic, and no one pays attention to the wounded soldiers. As a result, the humorous news of this one-legged disabled soldier buying a single shoe from a shoe store became known throughout the country through the Reuter's telegram.</p>
<p>This is a small matter. Probably leisurely people will not regard this news as some kind of humorous relaxing material, like gossiping about love affairs with relish, because in the eyes of those people, this matter is extremely absurd—can shoes sold in pairs be split up and bought one by one? In such a society, the judge's verdict is truly fair and decisive!</p>
<p>However, "fair and decisive" has so easily concealed this simple, ordinary, but actually very complex and serious social problem!</p>
<p>China has civil wars every year, China's army increases every year, the villages are sparsely populated, the fields are all barren, and the strong young men are subjected to the oppression of life and run to the front lines of the civil war. How cruel war is! The people's livelihood drives this countless hungry group under the artillery fire, ruthlessly destroying—death and injury!</p>
<p>China's army is larger than any other country in the world, but the lives of Chinese soldiers are more miserable than those of soldiers in any other country in the world. Other countries' armies do not fight civil wars, other countries' armies have a prosperous life, common entertainment, perfect training, and barracks. The Chinese army has to drag its guns and go to the front line to fight desperately, without salary, without entertainment, without training, without barracks, without anything, but they have to drag their guns and fight desperately!</p>
<p>Today, the psychology of the Chinese people is that everyone is afraid and disgusted when they see soldiers. This is because Chinese soldiers have ideas as soon as they see the common people, they are hungry and want to grab food from the people, they have no entertainment and want to find village women for pleasure, they sleep in the wilderness and want to forcibly occupy civilian houses. All of this is the unavoidable suffering of Chinese soldiers and the misfortune of the common people. When we look at these sufferings and misfortunes, who can we blame? Where should reason and conscience be found?</p>
<p>Central Government Stops Abetting Manchurian Autonomy</p>
<p>On the battlefields of civil war, the soldiers who are tragically injured, what merit do they have to the country and the people? But the wounded soldiers in the past have relied on their hard work and high merits to be arrogant and invincible. They are not arrogant to military officers, but only vent their depressed anger on the common people, and the common people suffer misfortune. Who can be blamed for this? If you ask him for whom he was injured, he will be menacing, but he does not know for whom or for what he was injured.</p>
<p>It is said that the one-legged soldier's leg in the Reuter's telegram was lost in the "national war" in Shanghai. This leg of his was for the honor of the country and the nation, and the people should not feel disgusted, right? But "one-legged only needs one shoe," "shoes must be bought in pairs," who can say who is right and who is wrong in this conflict of interests?</p>
<p>Only the judge is fair and decisive: "Shoes must be bought in pairs. If only one shoe is bought, the store owner is right to refuse."</p>
<p>Thus, this one-legged soldier will never be able to buy shoes in this world for the rest of his life! Is this a tribulation he should have in his fate?</p>
<p>From this small matter, we can see how bad our country has become! The country is unfortunate, everything is impossible, reason, conscience, law::: what meaning do we see these things play in the world? Alas, what meaning do they play?:::</p>
<h3 id="e291">Rat Infestation <a href="#e291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Bing</p>
<p>My apartment has always had rats, but recently they have become more and more numerous, leading to a terrible rat infestation.</p>
<p>It was one day, I was still sleeping greedily, the sound of washing chamber pots in the alley had long been silent, the time was certainly after nine o'clock, suddenly I was awakened by the sound of "sa sa sa", I opened my drowsy eyes and found that the shirt hanging on the east corner was moving. Speaking of this shirt, although it has a very deep relationship with me—it is my close-fitting clothes, and the material is so good, it is silk. But as soon as the weather turned cooler, I seemed to dislike it, letting it hang alone in the east corner, too lazy to tidy it up, and too lazy to take it to wash. However, this thing is not bad, except that the substance itself is green, and it has accumulated a lot of grease from my body, which is exactly what cunning rats love most. When I got out of bed to look, I found that the front, back, and cuffs were gnawed into countless holes. I also let it hang as it was, not wanting to mend it or take it to wash.</p>
<p>This matter was known to Wu Jun, who lived in the same room, and he was very angry. He picked up a fly swatter and searched in all directions of the corner. At this time, I sat back on the bed, too lazy to wipe my face, just staring at Wu Jun in a daze, maybe Wu Jun was blaming me for not helping him.</p>
<p>Of course, I also hated that the rats gnawed my clothes. However, I felt that this was because the room was too messy. If you want to avoid rat infestation, you must first tidy up the room and throw away all the bad things. Why are there no rats in Mrs. Mei's house? There are none in Brother Yi's house either. It turns out that their apartments are very clean and tidy, and all the bad things are piled up separately. I also wanted to do this. However, I was too昏庸and lazy, just talking about it. Although I tried my best to throw away the bad things, there were still so many, and the room was still messy.</p>
<p>Recently, there have been more and more rats. They have no scruples and come out during the day, somersaulting by my feet. Humph, this really makes me angry and amused, but I am too lazy to care, and when they slip away a little, I just let it go.</p>
<p>I don't know why, but I thought of the large white cat raised by the second landlord, so I went to visit the second landlord and told him about my rat infestation in detail. He said that rats are the most hateful, and I have a large white cat here, you can catch it and use it. So I caught the white cat, I respected it as my only savior. Sure enough, the first night was relatively quiet, and the rats did not make such a mess of overturning boxes and cabinets. But after a long time, it returned to its previous state. It turned out that although the white cat was large, it was useless. It only knew how to eat, only knew how to scream, and even defecated everywhere. The rats knew that the white cat was so useless, so they unscrupulously made trouble again. Sometimes they even teased the white cat together. The white cat probably knew that it was originally useless, so it secretly ran back. Wu Jun originally did not agree to catch the white cat, knowing that it was useless. If you want to get rid of the rat infestation, you can only work hard to fight and catch it yourself, which is a simple way.</p>
<p>After the white cat left, the rats became even more violent. I was too lazy, and after a long time, I became calm about it. The shirt hanging in the east corner has been gnawed so badly, just let it be, I don't want it anymore. Yesterday, I looked at a cotton robe hanging not far to the left, and there were also traces of rat gnawing, but I was still too lazy to tidy it up.</p>
<p>Wu Jun saw that I was so lazy and useless, and he was not interested in fighting anymore. He has not said anything for a long time. This morning, two friends came to visit, and they felt very sorry for me when they saw my rat-damaged items. They said they would think of a way for me, but there would be a reward, or the cotton robe would be given to them, or many photos hanging in front of the bed would be chosen by them, or some better and more valuable things in the suitcase would be given to them.</p>

<h3 id="e293">Saying a Few Fair Words for Women <a href="#e293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>
<p>— Shu</p>
<p>The Shen Bao on the 15th carried a statement by Mr. Shi Ying, a member of the Central Committee: "Women spend as much as more than 1.4 million yuan on cosmetics, perfumes, etc." This number is truly impressive! It is enough to show the extent of the total spending power of women. Even this small decoration among the thousands of decorations has been counted to be so alarming. If other more valuable items are added, it will be more than several million yuan?</p>
<p>Loving beauty is a very common mentality; especially for women, competing for beauty and vying for splendor, greatly showing off their style. But this phenomenon is ultimately artificial "affected creation." The ugly often overuse artificial means to make up for congenital defects, resulting in "overdoing it and spoiling it," making them look even uglier; if they are "naturally beautiful," then there is no need for such a thing, simply tidy up their clothes and keep them clean, the more simple the more natural and beautiful. Although it may not be like the famous French novelist, Colette, who would be "infatuated for several days" at first sight, it can at least save a lot of money. If one person can do this, and expand and universalize it, it may not be useless to the country and society. However, in this new era where everything is considered outdated unless it is fashionable, despite saying this, there is no impact at all. Who has the right to interfere or restrict it? They have money, the money is their own, and spending their own money is their duty, which can be said to be freedom. The word "also" in Mr. Shi Ying's statement seems to imply a little regret, but it can only be a regret. Moreover, other types of decorations besides swallowing grease cannot push the responsibility of consumption entirely on women. A group of modern men are also busy with consumption and busy with decoration, in order to meet the conditions they consider beautiful. Since women's hair has become fashionable with fluffy curls, things like hair oil have become exclusive consumer goods for men. Men and women are naturally matching animals, women want to please men, so they desperately work on their bodies and faces; and men want to take advantage of it, in order to win the other's attention, a smile, to the point of::::, naturally they also exhaust their ability to do what they can, and try their best to show off. "Since I flatter your beauty, you also please my face." Thus, they "love each other," "fly wing to wing," hug and kiss sweetly, live together and fly together, leisurely and carefree, and get what they want!" However, the point should be said back: consumption is shared by both sexes, and cannot be solely blamed on one aspect, but there is only a difference in the amount. For example: if the value of decorations reaches four million yuan, then a quarter of the consumption will undoubtedly be borne by modern men; women will certainly bear a heavier burden, let's say three quarters.</p>

<p>What should a son do?</p>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I am an apprentice. My parents have been married for more than ten years. Their relationship was originally very good, but in recent years my father married a woman outside, so he is indifferent to my mother. My father always gives most of the money he earns to this woman, while he gives nothing to my mother. This makes my mother cry day and night, and she is depressed and unhappy. My mother is an old-fashioned woman, not comparable to modern women, so she tries her best to endure and never mentions divorce. I feel that if this continues, my mother will either commit suicide or die of anger. Therefore, I hope that you will instruct my mother and son on the only way out as soon as possible, or a way to make my father realize his mistake. I am anxiously waiting for your reply. Respectfully,</p>
<p>Li Haoran</p>
<p>X X X</p>
<p>Editor's Note: According to the law, even if you are unwilling to file a "bigamy" lawsuit against Li Jun's father, you can also file a lawsuit against this woman for "obstructing the family"; this is a radical solution. However, after winning the lawsuit, it is hard to say whether Li Jun's father will not resent her even more because of this and restore the old feelings. This is when the law is exhausted!</p>
<p>If the material aspect can be barely maintained, then we advocate letting Li Jun's father go. Let him be free, and maybe he will have a day of self-awareness in the future. In addition, Li Jun should work hard to make progress, so that your mother can have considerable comfort in spirit and feel that there is still hope for the future. When a person has hope, "suicide" and "dying of anger" will naturally not be a problem.</p>

<p>— Zhang Lao San</p>
<p>Uncle Thirty-Four's House</p>
<p>Talking to capitalists is not much different from meeting important people. It is not that I am dissatisfied with my uncle Xu Bingnan, I should "know the difficulty and retreat" and "know when to stop." Three years of hard life have made me understand everything. My uncle has clearly told you that there are not many days left this year, you have to wait for the opportunity to come next year. Originally, the opportunity flew in from the window, don't let it escape from the door. There are opportunities everywhere in life, what is the hurry at the end of this year when there are not many days left? Besides, I am still young, and there will be many, many more years to come!</p>
<p>That unexpected business and my cousin's encouragement are still a beautiful dream for me.</p>
<p>"Uncle, I'll come again another day." I stood up.</p>
<p>My uncle squinted his eyes and nodded, two thick white smokes spewing out from his nostrils, indicating that he was very satisfied with the handling of this matter.</p>
<p>"How can a nephew not eat at his aunt's house?" Second Aunt jumped up from the opium couch and raised her arm to look at her watch. "It's time for lunch, Eldest Miss, tell the kitchen to serve the food upstairs."</p>
<p>Hui-jie ignored her.</p>
<p>"Aunt, I'll come back to bother you another day. When I went out, my friends didn't know, I'm afraid they're waiting for me." I didn't wait for her to reply. "Uncle, I'm leaving. If there's anything, you can ask Hui-jie to write a letter to notify you."</p>
<p>"I know!" When Hui-jie pushed me out of the iron bed frame filled with opium smoke, that unique voice still came out from inside. "What's the point of being polite?"</p>
<p>Walking down the stairs, I walked out the door as if agreeing. The doorman's smiling face appeared from the doorway, bowing and saying:</p>
<p>"Miss, do you want a car?"</p>
<p>Hui-jie shook her head and sent me straight to the door. She didn't seem to have any intention of going back in. I hurriedly stopped her and said, "You don't have to see me off."</p>
<p>"I'm also going to the club to see Min-jie." She stared at the tips of her toes moving forward, as if thinking about something incredible.</p>
<p>I was embarrassed to stop her too much, and walked slowly side by side with her on the cinder road towards the tram stop in Xujiahui.</p>
<p>Thirty-Five A Warm Smile</p>
<p>I came and went on this cinder road three times under three different circumstances. The first time, I broke up with Min-jie and returned disappointed from the grand event of the sermon meeting, holding huge hopes. When I came out of the side door of the Fangwai Villa, I was like a lost dog, holding my own heavy steps. The second time, because of the misunderstanding of the love triangle, I secretly came to confess everything to my cousin on a clear morning in mid-May, but a half-day stay brought me two months of serious illness. Today, I revisit this cinder road full of scars, walking silently side by side with Hui-jie, recalling when she didn't recognize me and laughed and talked to her companions, I couldn't help but feel sentimental. No matter what, Hui-jie had an unstoppable emotion for me. Her recent everything towards me has been proven by facts. She wanted to snatch me from Min-jie's hands. I stepped on my own cluster of black shadows, and the sound of the cinder being crushed was like the blood in my heart boiling. I was surrounded in the arms of two different women, leaving the Zhengyi Society and attaching myself to my uncle. No matter whether his plan becomes a reality in a month, it makes no difference to me. However, I don't have any deep-seated hatred for Hui-jie. She accepted my advice and jumped out of the hell of urban girls for me, because she loves me; but I escaped from my hometown oppressed by evil forces, I have great hopes, now is not the time for us to fall in love.</p>
<p>I glanced at Hui-jie, her walking seemed to be pulled by something, and she also seemed to be counting her own steps. This short cinder road seems to be particularly long today. I mustered up the courage several times to say a few words that have been hidden in my heart for a long time to Hui-jie, but when they rushed to my throat, I couldn't say them. As we walked, the shadows on the ground gradually shortened, until they were completely trampled under our four legs. The sun has climbed to noon. Passing the small restaurant where I had a hearty meal, several rickshaws were parked in front of the door. The rickshaw pullers were gobbling down large bowls of rice. It seemed that they would never be bothered by anything, and after putting down their rice bowls, they dragged their empty cars to do their only job.</p>
<p>We stopped at the tram stop, and there was no tram coming from afar. When walking, we can barely maintain silent loneliness, but now we are standing next to the tram stop, and there are only two of us, so I was forced to say a word.</p>
<p>"Hui-jie, have you eaten?" I looked at the group of rickshaw pullers.</p>
<p>"Are you hungry?"</p>
<p>"I remembered eating a meal in this restaurant and being sick for two months." I shook my head and said:</p>
<p>"Why talk about the past? I'm not suffering from two months of illness?"</p>
<p>The tone of voice was so annoyed, finally I laughed myself, a sincere and warm smile.</p>

<p>— Zhao Yinian</p>
<p>"At any stage of my life, I have never been as happy as I am now. This is a new beginning, a new future; everything in the past is like a dirty mirror, wiped clean.</p>
<p>"For the first time in five years, I feel like I'm playing a role that I can play. This is a huge opportunity. I owe this joy and gratitude to Miss Garbo, but I have no hope of repaying it.</p>
<p>"I have had a very difficult time in my life. I am very surprised at how I fell from the heaven of lofty honor to the abyss where no one cares. But now, as quickly as before, and as surprisingly, I am on the road to revival. What a strange experience!</p>
<p>"It is a great honor to work with Miss Garbo on the screen again. She is a great artist, a great woman. It is no secret that it is because of her ability that I can play this role. She believes in my misfortune and wants to correct people's mistakes about me. My only hope and desire is how should I do it, so that I can live up to her confidence in me." John Gilbert said this.</p>
<p>"This is Colossal" is a phrase that John Gilbert used to say.</p>
<p>Ignoring all opposition and gossip, Garbo worked hard to convince the MGM authorities to sign a contract with John to be the male lead in her new film.</p>
<p>They met - John was nervous and confused in this unexpected good news. As for Garbo, who knows what she felt and what she thought?</p>
<p>After all, our brave John opened his mouth first. "Great!" he said happily. In Garbo's heart, this phrase that John used to say often suddenly invaded. Eight years ago, when they started filming "Flesh and the Devil," this Colossal English word was the first word that John taught our shy and clumsy Swedish girl."</p>
<p>From the time John married Jna Claira until he signed this contract, they had not met or spoken. During these years, they worked in the same studio. Garbo rose steadily, stepping on the ladder of happiness; John, on the other hand, fell until he could barely see any light.</p>
<p>John's reputation declined day by day. Only because of the contract, MGM had to pay him his salary as before. As soon as the contract expired, he was immediately fired. In these long years of misfortune, he had almost no achievements. It was extremely difficult for him to come to the studio. When he met old friends on the road, he hid like a snake, hoping that they would not see him. He considered himself a failure in a permanently unrecoverable position, and his name would never shine in the electric light again.</p>
<p>John, who was kicked out of MGM, went to Fox Company to try his luck. (Many years ago, he had filmed "The Count of Monte Cristo" at Fox.) He also tried to be a director. But they all failed.</p>
<p>John's former fame was extinguished like a fire. What a huge shame! This black-faced, big-eyed hero once intoxicated the hearts of many young girls. Young girls took their lovers to the cinema to see John, hoping that they would learn from John. But why was he so unfortunate?</p>
<p>But, miss, please don't be discouraged. A woman named Garbo has brought John back to you. She was his sweetheart once. She is a great woman. She brought back his bright future to him. His failure caused her more pain and more thoroughly in her heart than he did himself. Although this is not specific pain.</p>
<p>"Queen Christina" is the film she starred in with John. The part of the script about John was rewritten by her, especially suitable for John's personality. She believes that this film can restore his lost glory. (Omitted below)</p>

<p>(RatterRomancee)</p>
<p>丨Produced by RKO, Premiered in Shanghai丨</p>
<p>A humorous film.</p>
<p>However, we find that the author has indeed portrayed the landlord very well. Renting out an extremely simple rooftop room to both a man and a woman simultaneously, while ensuring both tenants are satisfied; stingy, cunning, and meticulously calculating even the smallest amounts of money – a complete sketch of a petty urbanite. The unique demeanor of a small merchant is vividly and realistically depicted by the author, making him very lively and lovable.</p>
<p>People like this are indeed very familiar to urban dwellers, and therefore, such a character can easily evoke genuine empathy in us.</p>
<p>Similarly, the author's depiction of the lives of the two tenants, a man and a woman, who belong to the lower middle class, is also very realistic. The young woman, due to financial constraints, had to move from a large room to the attic, and share it with another man, taking shifts. The man, when caught in heavy rain, had no clothes to change into and had to wait fifteen minutes at the laundry entrance, soaked in the rain. :: Such struggles of lower middle-class people for survival, and their various lifestyles, are portrayed in a way that is close to reality.</p>
<p>But what is the author's attitude towards these things? Instead of portraying them directly, he beautifies their lives with a humorous approach. Of course, we are not against the use of comedy, but for certain themes, the comedic form reduces the seriousness of the drama. If someone were to ask, haven't Charlie Chaplin's portrayals of lower middle-class life also been in the form of comedy? True. However, the author of this film is far inferior to Charlie Chaplin.</p>
<p>In order to create humor and gags, a very far-fetched story is constructed. A man and a woman living in the same house, how can they not know each other for a long time? This kind of coincidence is not believable. As for writing about them being in love with each other, while also showing them being pursued by another person of the opposite sex, it clearly doesn't give people a good impression and only serves the interest of the story itself.</p>
<p>Here, it seems to approach the issue of housing. Regardless of whether the author intentionally lightens a serious issue, one can recognize that American films are beginning to pay attention to social problems in the choice of subject matter. This is a previously rare situation.</p>
<h3 id="e298">Hollywood's Newly Discovered Companionate Divorce <a href="#e298" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c298" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">298</a></h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>Hollywood is truly a place where anything can happen, and the styles of marriage and divorce are especially numerous. We may have heard of it, but many people must still not understand what is called a Companionate Marriage. But now, a new type of Companionate Divorce has been added. What is a Companionate Marriage? Simply put, it means that after marriage, each person continues their original life. Either they continue to live separately, or they live together, and everyone does not interfere with each other's freedom. In short, the life between a couple is like the relationship between two friends. Speaking of Companionate Divorce, simply put, it means that a married couple is now separated, but not divorced. Not only are they not divorced, but they can still visit each other or have a one or two-day gathering, after making an appointment. Why practice this kind of Companionate Divorce? First, it may be because each spouse has their own career, and living together can be distracting. Household chores, in particular, can easily deprive women of their freedom, so they agree to live separately. Second, it may be that the couple has disagreements, but their feelings have not completely broken down, so they come up with this method as an excellent compromise.</p>
<p>Who invented this Companionate Divorce? It turns out that it was invented by Hollywood star Gloria Stuart and her husband Gordon Newell. Newell is an artist specializing in sculpture. The couple's feelings have not broken down, but because each person has their own career, they feel that living together is uneconomical in terms of time and energy, so they agreed to live separately. Before they separated, a reporter interviewed them. They even talked to the reporter about the meaning of Companionate Divorce. Newell's main idea was that the meaning of their separation was not in the words "separation," but in the words "division of labor," which is simply separating to work. Stuart said: "My job is to make films. I should spend all my time in the studio. Therefore, I can no longer take care of Gordon's affairs. And living together, everyone's time and work are hindered, so we can't help but think of a win-win solution. That is the "Companionate Divorce" we want to implement."</p>

<p>Clark Gable Benefits from Misfortune</p>
<p>Clark Gable had a serious illness this autumn, and almost passed away. Now he has gradually recovered. Not only has his illness improved, but the doctor says he can also be healthy into old age. What's the reason? Originally, Clark Gable had two dangerous ailments. One was the decay of the tonsils in his throat, and the other was severe appendicitis. Since joining Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, he has been extremely busy with work, so although his health was getting worse, he never had time to have them treated due to the pressure of work. This time is different. He had a serious illness and almost died. Therefore, he listened to the doctor's orders and decided to solve these two ailments fundamentally. So, after his serious illness slightly improved, he first had his throat operated on to treat the inflammation of his tonsils. After his throat slightly improved, he then had his abdomen opened. This was originally a last-ditch effort, but unexpectedly, Clark Gable was able to achieve good results, and since his two fatal ailments have been removed, the doctor said that he can live a long life.</p>

<p>— Su Yin</p>
<p>Bael listened to Qiao quietly, and he suddenly understood the meaning of Laurie and Amy's marriage. He shyly took Qiao's hand, and he said, "Please wait a moment. I have something to say to you." He was very timid at first, but he finally stuttered and continued, "I am too bold, I don't have the courage to think, but I dare" hope that you can leave some space in your heart for a person who is not very lucky::: Oh, I know I shouldn't be so presumptuous to ask you this question at this time, your heart is too full of happiness now | but I can come back another day, if you let me come back to see you. I am now in Boston, and have found a position, so丨" He stopped here, he looked at Qiao's face very sincerely. For a while, everyone stood silently facing each other, each with their own secret thoughts. Their faces. Very slowly, a new kind of joy gradually emerged. Then Qiao grabbed Bael's arm and pulled him inside. She introduced him to everyone with great pride. She told many things about their time in New York, but the new secret about the two of them | that was too sweet and too precious, and it was not yet time to reveal it | Finally, she said, "He brought a book, my book has now been published.</p>
<p>Then everyone clamored around, congratulating her and scrambling to see the new book. They warmly welcomed Professor Bael, thanking him for all the kindness he showed to Qiao. Bael also talked to them very generously, calling out each person's name, which obviously surprised everyone. So Qiao told them, "He knows you all, because your names are all in my book, so he knows them." Bael said, "But you don't have to worry, Qiao wrote with a loving pen, which can make the readers laugh and rejoice with you." After he finished speaking, he looked around as if looking for something he had been away from for a long time. He suddenly saw the piano, and he said in a low voice, "Oh, this is the piano."</p>
<p>"Bael, please sit down and play," Qiao said. So Bael sat down without hesitation, and his hand lightly touched the piano keys, and immediately as if turning stone into gold, the piano emitted a melodious tone. Everyone listened quietly, and deep emotions appeared on everyone's faces. Then Bael began to sing again. Mr. Laurence leaned back in his chair, his eyes closed. John Brooke secretly held Meg's hand, and Meg responded with a sweet smile. The old aunt's face, which was full of frost, seemed to have melted. Laurie and Amy stood next to the piano, Laurie's hand around Amy's slender waist. What about Qiao? Looking at Bael's dilapidated appearance, she seemed to have already fallen deeply in love. She asked her mother in a low voice, "Do you think he is good? Her mother wiped away her happy tears, nodded to indicate her permission, and thought that Qiao's romance, which she had always thought would not blossom, was now flourishing there. (The End)</p>
