<p>時評</p>
<h3>國聯宣示不承認僞組織</h3>
<p>— 元</p>
<p>國務曾於本年六月十四日。以顧問委員會名義。提出關於不承認僞滿洲國之計畫。通造國聯會員國與非會員國。並函致委員會中十八國代表。謂若不接反對之覆書。即視此項計畫爲已成立。今據國又秘書長發表。已接到十國答覆。皆表示贊成。美國並在覆文内表示倘或僞組織請求加入任何國際條約。如凱洛格公約之類。美政府凖備不予睬理。英國並以通告中遺漏海上安全與載貨限度兩公約。而主加入。則其不承認之態度。甚爲明白堅决。他如古巴委内瑞拉。海地。哥倫比亞。尼加拉圭。等數小國。原則亦皆承認。惟於所列項目。尚在考慮。僅暹羅一國稍示游移。但亦祇以與滿洲未有關係爲言。而不表示反對。是可知世界各國。對於僑滿洲國之不承認。已顯然全體一致。夫世界各國之所以一致否認僞滿洲國者。以僞滿洲國爲日本張力所造成。攫取中國土地。以置於另一勢力之下。破壞中國領土。實無可爲諱。今國聯之不承認僞國。質言之即承認僞滿洲國之土地。爲我中國所有。以表示其　護會員國領土完整之意。雖不能進而以實力制裁日本。然而此種公平之主張。亦可稍加憑藉武力者以幾分之約束。而一方面更可使中國人民。知公道尙在人間。世界各國旣不承認僞滿洲國。則是滿洲領土。尙未因遷就已成之事實。而至於無可翻身之地。尙留此一線命運。以待我人民之爭取。我國人民而苟不喪心病狂者。必將因此而益增其收復失地之信念。我國國力雖弱。然收復失地之心。則始終未忘。豈有世界各國同情於我不承認强力創造之僞組織。而謂我國人民。反降心低首以承認之乎。此吾人所敢堅决表示以承受國聯之好意也。</p>
<p>惟國聯之鴉片顧問委員會。對此一問題之處置。則殊令吾人不解。昨載國民電謂今日决定報告書内。凡涉及滿洲僞組織處。皆稱爲『滿洲及熱河亦稱爲「滿洲國」』等字様。此種技術的名稱。因各委員鑒於昨夜秘書長愛文諾發表各大國幾一致主張維持不承認僞組織政策而後决定云云。此種模稜兩可巧於敷衍之决議。已令吾人懷疑。而據今日哈瓦斯電訊。又謂日本代表横山要求於報告書内所載滿洲及熱河地名下。須加註『即所稱「滿洲國」領土』字様。經法律股審查後准予照辦。此則更可怪異。夫如前說用技術的名稱。已失國聯公正之態度。若如今日哈瓦斯所傳因日本要求而加註「滿洲國領土」字様。則更顯示與各大國一致主張維持不承認僞組織之政策相反。尤與美國覆文内表示倘僞組織請求加入任何國際條約凖備决不睬理之旨相予盾。縱日人外交之手段工巧。誘脅兼施。而法律股竟敢貿然負此破壞國聯一致主張之政策之責任乎。使哈瓦斯社所傳之消息而確。吾知國聯必將有以設法挽救。以消滅其自相矛盾内部不一致之玷也。</p>
<h3>國聯顧問會通過鴉片報告　遠東秘密製毒所之危險</h3>

<h3>日本對華政策遵循五相會議决定方針</h3>
<p>（東京）　本日閣議席上、有一部分閱僚、關於南京政府之情勢、提出質問、廣田外復謂無論南京政府保持之對策若何、日本政府須以曾經在五相會議所决定之根本方針爲基礎、而定其步驟云、（十日日聯電）</p>
<h3>日機侵入俄領空事件蘇俄公布對日抗議書　聲明此舉爲横暴開未有先例要求保證將來及懲戒負責人</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）　自蘇俄政府指斥日本軍用飛機飛入俄境侵犯領土權後、兩國關係日益疏遠、今日已有顯明證據、蘇俄駐日大使關於飛機越境事向日外務省抗議照會、亦於今日由俄政府公布、照會内措辭强硬、聲稱此舉爲未有先例之侵犯蘇俄境土、足見俄方之重視此事、又據政界消息、前日蘇俄慶視共産十六週紀念、各國大使皆參預盛典獨日本大使太田、旣未赴邀參加閱兵典禮、晚間蘇俄中央執行委員會主席喀列寗正式受賀時、太田亦未往、此種情形、及是日蘇俄人民委員會主席莫洛託夫之激烈演說、業已引起各方紛紛評論、僉認兩國邦交絶少進步云、（九日國民電）</p>
<p>（南京）　蘇聯駐日大使優列湼夫奉蘇聯政府命、於十一月六日向外務大臣廣田提出對於日本軍用機飛入蘇聯境内之抗議、該項覺書指明十一月三日有日本偵察機八架及轟炸機一架、飛往阿木爾灣西岸之司拉維恩加及巴拉巴什等附近、日軍用機飛過赴蘇聯境内距離邊界二十五至三十公里之多數處所、該覺書復謂、「予經蘇聯政府授權、對於此項横暴、而在性質與範圍上、俱屬空前的侵入蘇聯邊界行動提出抗議、並堅持將來不得再有此類行動發生、迅予澈查此項事件之眞相、並將上述飛行負責人員移付懲戒、」其結語謂、「予願表示堅定之信心、即日本政府必能採取有效步驟以滿足此項聲明」云、（八日塔斯電）</p>
<h3>日外務省聲明日俄戰均不利　認有緩和空氣之必要</h3>
<p>（東京）　當此美俄復交行將實現之際、蘇俄方面對於日本發出警告、謂日本飛機擅行飛入沿海州地方、將發生不愉快之結果、日本外務省昨夜對此發表見解如下、日俄間現在並無何等紛爭事件、足以誘發戰爭之危機、且日俄戰爭、於兩國不利、從歷史與經騐觀之、誠有因小事破壞局面者、故日俄兩當局今日有設法使日俄問空氣好轉之必要、關於此點、廣田外相曾警告優列勒夫大使、而蘇俄仍再三爲反日宣傳、殊不合理、日俄間之和平如被攪亂、其責當在蘇俄、日本對於美俄復交、從世界和平人類福祉之見地、表示歡迎、不理解此好意的寛容、徒以反日宣傳爲國際外交之武器、對蘇聯當局此等狹量等近視的政策、不得不令人失望、如此次日軍飛機問題、蘇俄以美國最懸念日軍之攻略沿海州、故利用此點爲反宣傳、冀於美俄復交有利、然日本旣絶無此等事實存在、可以置之不理、（十日電通）</p>

<h3>梅濁尅星&lt;的藥理與特徵　愛迪那博士發現深部殺菌法全世界醫師始得淋病根治藥</h3>
<p>「奉送淋病療養新書函　憑此廣告向上海郵政信箱一四六五號立即寄奉」</p>
<p>愛迪那博士發現深部殺菌法</p>
<p>全世界醫師始得淋病根治藥</p>
<p>“ＭＡＴＨＥＺＩＮ”ＭＯＳＴＥＦＦＥＣＴＩＶＥ　ＡＮＴＩ－ＧＯＮＯＲＲＨＯＣＵＮ　德國白濁專藥梅濁尅星發明者愛迪那博士肖影</p>
<h3>淋病難治的理由</h3>
<p>淋病的難以治療，爲醫界和病者共同呼喊的一句話，淋病難治的理由很多：第一，是因爲淋病的急性症候經過了，變成了慢性的時候，病人已没有十分的痛苦，就不肯繼續醫治斷根，這就是病人没有忍耐的心緣故，第二，是因爲患者不曉得攝生的方法，如房事，飲酒，過勞等種種，都是使淋病延長治療的時日，第三，是經濟的問題，没有錢去醫治，但是在吾們醫學上的地位觀察起來，淋病難治的理由，除了上面所講的原因以外，還有最重大的，就是因爲尿道解剖上的關係，尿道的經路上，有許多的粘液腺，譬如列氏腺，可氏腺，還有攝護腺，他們的開口部，都是在尿道上，尿道上的淋菌，醫師可以用殺菌的藥消滅牠，但是潛伏在這様腺管内的淋菌，實在難以殺滅，所以表面似乎已經治愈的淋病，遇着了勞苦，房事，飲酒等種種的誘因，再發作起來；就是因爲潛伏在腺内的淋菌再出來作祟的緣故，所以要淋病斷根，必須有經騐的醫師用深部殺菌的新醫術，把這様的淋菌巢窠醫沼好了，方才可以斷根呢！</p>
<h3>淋病斷根的新法</h3>
<p>淋菌的難滅是已經講過，要把淋菌巢窠醫好方才把淋菌斷根，究竟淋病怎様的可以算作斷根呢？也是醫師與病家兩方面所渴想的一件事！以醫學上的地位論起來，淋菌的消滅，就作爲淋病的治愈，但是僅僅檢尿的時候，没有淋菌，運不能算數；因爲粘液膜管内的深部，還有淋菌潛伏着，遇着了機會，譬如交接飲酒勞動等，仍然要發作的；必定要證明深部的淋菌確實消滅了，方才可算達到目的，究竟用怎様的方法，可以證明深部也没有淋菌呢？醫師祗用一種深部殺菌的新藥，就呌「梅濁尅星」！把潛伏的淋菌完全殺盡，行了此法以後，猶請不出淋菌，並且没有其他可疑的症候時，大約可作爲斷根，經過了三個月半年一年之後，再行同様的方法，没有淋菌，而且經過良好的時候，就是淋病完全治愈了！</p>
<p>還有一句話，就是男人家雖然完全醫治，如不同時醫治她已經被傳染的妻子，這様的醫治，是没有用的。</p>
<h3>特種「梅濁尅星」的醫治作用</h3>
<p>『梅濁尅星』爲德國愛迪那博士耗四十年之心血，經二百五十五次的動物試騐，送請全世界花柳病院八百七十八處實騐，始告成功的淋濁斷根特效藥！『特種梅濁尅星』乃係『梅濁尅星』發明後，繼續研究最近成功更進一步的新創作，其藥性的王道，功效的神速，可稱十全十美，絶非市上一般普通白濁丸等所可比倫，實爲二十世紀醫藥界最偉大之新貢獻！</p>
<p>（一）本劑有專門透入男女局部的深部粘膜腺細胞内，殺盡淋菌的特微，所以服過此藥者的小便，也有極强大的殺菌力，例如：對内服『梅濁尅星』七天以上的病人二十名，各取其五『克蘭姆』的小便，投之以一『白金耳』的淋菌，則十五分鐘以内果能殺滅，此爲現代醫學上最驚異的一大事實！</p>
<p>（二）藥性和平毫無無副作用，絶非檀油劣藥之妨害腸胃碍及生育等流弊百出者可比。</p>
<p>（三）專治急性慢性，五淋白濁，婦女白帶，膀胱炎，尿道炎等病，有屢試屢騐的特效。</p>

<h3>黃何與岡村談判之結果　通車方案内容力守秘密岡村殷同均作樂觀表示</h3>
<p>— 達</p>
<p>北平通信、日本關東軍代表岡村喜多等到平後、前日在外交大樓與黃郛何應欽正式會談、各項問題交涉原則、業業商定、詳細辦法、俟於實行之際、隨時續商、黃何昨晨（八日）赴扶桑館答訪岡村、談話約一小時、岡村等以在平任務已畢、今（九日）日至頤和園遊覽　准於明日（十日）赴津、謁見于學忠、略作商談後、十二日乘飛機返長春、北寗路通車問題、已由該路局長殷同擬定具體方案、由鐵道部派來恊助辦理之專員夏光宇、轉呈鐵部核辦、方案内容、力守秘密、惟聞唯一要件、爲除北寗路車輛外、其他鐵路車輛不能開入關内、長城各口、日方已正式承認交還、由我方派遣行政人卝及保安隊前往接收、則體辦法、俟河北省府擬具呈准政整會核定、雙方即可交接、手續並不複雜　最短期間、可望實現、各口日軍、决俟明　始能撤盡、設立稅關問題、較爲繁雜、須由財政部詳細計劃、擬具辦法、通郵問題、則在研究郵票行使方法中、據北寗路局長殷同今晨談稱、北寗通車、業經謂</p>
<p>本局局務會議决定、惟方案内容、暫守秘密、岡村來平、長城各口之接收、已得結果、其餘雙方意見、尙未能完全一致、又據岡村談稱、此次到平、與黃何兩委員長談商各項問題、極爲圓滿、所談各事、皆係商定一種原則、並非具體方案、將來即按此原則進行、中日前途、政治方面、固尙多困難之處、經濟方面、相信漸可作到合作地步、交還長城各口、當然無問題、戰區以内所駐之少數日軍之撤退、亦爲當然之事、惟因關外勞房構築未竣、故尙須假以時日耳、通車通郵、爲吾人所熱望、雖未詳細商談、亦望早日做到云云、由殷同及岡村之談話以觀、日來雙方交涉之内容、當可窺見一斑矣、（十一月九日）</p>
<h3>新疆事變經過　由金樹仁到盛世才東北軍與新局關係</h3>
<p>迪化通信、民元以來、連年内戰、各省幾無一片乾凈土、但新疆尚稱安謐、雖回漢略有衝突、均爲局部問題、一經安撫、遂告平息、但金樹仁長新後、因軍政措置失當、苛稅雜捐、横徵暴歛、使人民無喘息餘地、同時封鎖交通、實行愚民政策、政治黑暗、賄賂公行、以此種種原因、乃有第一次新疆事變之爆發、在此次新變中之主要脚色、一爲金樹仁、一爲馬仲英、金爲漢人、馬爲回人、伊等除爲權利之角逐外、猶含有種族之嫌怨、致雙方互相仇殺、死人逾萬、當戰事爆發後、金以所部（現在省軍）無戰鬭能力、每戰輒北、乃被迫出走、省軍交其參謀長盛世才統率、斯時馬軍已進至距省城甚近、聲言殺盡漢人、成立西北回族大同盟、並聯絡士耳其、組一回族國家、蓋馬爲回族新敎之青年、激烈派領袖、即馬福祥之家産、亦爲其所没收、但馬雖爲一青年、然作事任性、憑其血氣之勇、毫無近代知識、尤無政治思想、殆部落時代酋長之流亞也、</p>
<p>金出走後、殘部旣交盛世才整理、省府由駐在伊犂之師長張培元繼任、時馬仲英每戰告捷、大有一氣呵成之勢、乃以便衣隊出没於迪化近郊、漢人被殺甚衆、因之迪化城内、一夕數驚、適東北抗日軍蘇炳文部二千餘人、忽由俄轉道入新、吉林自衛軍李杜部六千餘人、亦由俄相繼趕到、蘇李兩部非但紀律嚴明、戰鬭力尤强、因之省軍聲勢大震、迪化之圍乃解、城内漢民、均簞食壺漿以迎、而蘇李兩部、則雅不欲參加内戰、乃由各將領函馬仲芙芵、婉勸停戰、最低限度、亦要嚴禁種族之仇殺、馬此時以戰勝餘威、竟不之顧、猶事殺掠、蘇李兩部爲數十萬漢人計、爲本身自衛計、乃毅然助省軍（即盛世才）以攻馬、馬大敗、幾不成軍、是役、東北軍陣亡有劉旅長及于吕兩團長、其激烈可想見矣、馬仲英旣遭惨敗、乃退至哈密吐魯番鄯善等處、收容所部、僅有四千、老弱居其半、時盛劉利用機會、通電全國、自任主席督辦、詭云爲民衆所推舉、盛劉以新起爐灶、基礎尙未鞏固、故對馬未予窮追、於是乘機罷兵、從事内部之整頓、外聯蘇俄以作奥援、而馬亦願於此時休養、俾圖再起、於是第一次之變亂、告一段落、新省政權、遂爲盛劉等所把持、仍取封鎖主義、斯時盛已儼然成爲新省之狄克推多矣、迨中央令黃慕松入新宣慰、冀將新事作一澈底解决、乃盛劉大起慌恐、　爲己位勢將不保、乃一不作二不休、將黃軟禁、以作要挾中央頒布軍政兩令之條件、當時檢查郵電施行戒嚴、形勢極爲緊張、並無辜槍殺陳中李笑天等三人、此時盛等已完全目無中央矣、</p>
<p>盛世才現有步兵兩旅、計二千三百人、爲原有之省軍、向無訓練、皆有嗜好、此外尙有白俄軍隊一旅、計一千五百人、名之曰歸化軍、每多酗酒滋事、紀律極壞、東北軍與馬仲英軍作戰、俘獲千餘人、即編爲衛隊團、駐督署守衛、此千餘人隨馬時間甚久、因之民衆咸恐終難帖服、乃最近有譁變之事發生、益證其不可靠、總之盛之直屬部隊共計四千餘人、有戰鬥力者僅十之二三、盛之、以能站住脚步者、完全因爲各部互相牽制所致、東北軍在回回誓必殺盡漢人的呼聲之下、爲自衛計、勢不能不與盛世才爲暫時之合作、張培元爲保存實力起見、坐看蚌鷸相爭、待收漁人之利、於是因力的平衡、而新疆將陷於永遠糾紛之境地、社會人士不察、每以東北軍爲盛世才之嫡系軍隊、其實皆係揣測附會之詞　東北各軍自有自歷史與系統、斷不受人利用也、</p>
<p>至於馬仲英雖敗、所以未被消滅者、原伊係當地土著、又爲青年派之激烈領袖、故潛伏勢力、較盛世才爲大、故目下新省已成爲盛馬對峙之局、張培元賣力僅有三千對歷次鬥爭、均未敢嘗試、并自以爲盛馬誰勝、與己皆無利也、至盛所以能自豪者、恃東北各軍爲之支撑、故對東北各軍將領、極盡籠絡、督辦署參謀長軍務廳長兵工廠長·軍官學校·省城衛戍司令、衛隊團長、舉凡一切重要位置、皆爲東北軍人物、在表面上、盛似極爲虛心誠懇、其實别有用意、如果東北軍離盛而中立、則新疆政局、將爲之一變、因在新各部、人數最多戰鬥能力最强者、首推東北軍、將來新局之解决、其癥結或在此也、</p>
<h3>徐州大火情况　地點爲新興商業中心區　統計損失達五十餘萬元</h3>
<p>徐州通信、徐埠大同街、爲城站交通孔道、亦新興商業之中心區、繁華甲於全埠、最近社會凋敝、人民購買力消失、該街商店、多舉行競賣、以廣招徠、懸燈結彩、夜市尤爲熱閙、近頃滬上國貨旅行團到徐、徐埠亦同時舉行國貨宣傳週、設市場于花園飯店、展覽推銷、因之大同街各商店、益復起勁、平素停業理帳之三數家商店、亦臨時開張、拍賣貨物、詎於八日晚五時電炬甫放光明之際、街之東段、突兆焚如、一時繁華市場、烈燄飛騰、如熾遊人、跟蹌奔走、婦啼孺號、慘不忍聞、火至九時始息、延燒四小時之久、燬屋八十餘間、損失至少當達五十萬元以上、兹紀情况如次、</p>
<h3>起火原因</h3>
<p>八日下午五時、大同街商店、爲競銷關係、除裝備加倍之電力外、并紛紛裝置汽油燈、以供夜市便利、花園飯店前樓房、建築于沿街北面、計共串樓十間、合爲十樓十底、西面之三間、爲天章綢莊、中間之四間、爲恊同順綢莊、東面之三間、爲元章紙號、恊同順樓上之汽油燈、以汽力過量、忽行爆炸、汽油四濺、火星亂飛、而該號與天章爲加足電力裝置之大電筒、乾電力猛、亦因緣而爆炸、電力油力、混合延燒、該兩號所堆貨物、概爲毛絲棉織品、東面之元章、又純係堆積紙張、均易引着、是以火發不十分鐘而十樓十底、延燒已遍、火光熊熊、不可響邇、維時遊人大亂、値班崗警、狂鳴警笛、公安一分二支局立電消防隊出動、同時鳴鑼告警、各救火會紛紛出發施救、</p>
<h3>延燒情形</h3>
<p>花園飯店前串樓旣已蔓延燒着、樓後有國貨展覽會臨時搭置这廣棚、紛紛折去、幸樓房甚高、後面全係磚石垣牆、未爲所延、樓之前面、一律廠間、火頭向街南撲、至將對面之同和公雜貨店引着、同和公東間壁之九福綢莊、亦蔓延發火、夾道火燄對飛、救火會駕水龍由西馳來者、均莫能通過、乃駕龍于火場之西、向東掃射、如鼓樓街文亭街救火會、均架水龍于火場之西、當時風勢、爲由西南吹向東北、是以火勢尙未西來、致更向東去、延燒街北國貨商塲之前樓、該樓與花園飯店前樓、僅一小蕎之隔、火勢首先延及西端之大成捲菸店、以次燒着中華鞋店、聚屋隆京貨店、鼎華洋貨店、美最時鐘表店、野玫瑰冰室、元和泰紙烟店、中加商場之大門、共計十一間樓房、火勢益猛、幸津浦　海兩路消防隊及東關慈善救火會趕到、分别駕　于火塲之東、激水猛射、又將商場前樓東側之草房拆除、始未再向東延、但該樓建築亦高、又係由樓當火烈時、已撲及對面、街南之美華照像　九章軍衣莊、亦被燒着、南開救火會早由新南門趕到、架　于火場之南、向北射激、始遏火勢之南延、至八時許、火勢始告　歇、維時瓦礫堆中、黑烟滾滾、東西水龍、始能通過街道、從事于澆滅殘餘之工作、</p>
<h3>警戒維持</h3>
<p>火勢一起、國貨展覽場中、遊人正多、大同街上、亦滿坑滿谷、睹火紛紛奔走、秩序極紊、七師幹部訓練隊、距火場最近、敎育長周體仁命令出發、公安局警、紛紛馳來、軍警崗位、　佈于街頭巷尾、在展覽場中遊客、以前門爲火封閉、均由從門走出火烈時、津浦警備司令王均·縣長佘念兹·公安局長王世才·七師政訓處長龍次雲·第二招募長陳學順、以及各分局長鎭長、均到塲視察、指揮維持、是以秩序尙佳、但隣近各商店之未保火險者、均紛紛挪移什物、於較遠空地、堆積如山、且有以水沃棉被蓋於屋脊之上、以防火燄之飛集延燒者、啼哭之聲、與警笛之音、觸耳生悲、大同街上、泥水淋漓、幾無一塊乾凈土、至九時後、始漸平息、而餘波又起、</p>
<h3>飛燄肇禍</h3>
<p>飯店前樓與商塲前樓之中間、有小巷一道、巷中有草房數間、當火烈時、以距離較遠、未被延燒、但飛燄集於屋上、當時未及發覺、迨火息之後、遠處水龍回去、該草房忽告火發、遂又呌笛鳴鑼、幸消防隊龍尙未返、及返至中途之水龍、又復赶回、瞬息數間草屋又成灰燼、幸最初施救時、各房屋上、已水分甚多、未至延燒、至十時後、乃完全撲滅、而餘燼則在終夜灌澆之中、大同街上、澈夜戒嚴、</p>
<h3>損失統計</h3>
<p>此次大火損失、除各商號貨物暫難得精確統計、所焚房屋計路北天章六間、恊同順八間、元章六間、以上爲飯店前樓、房主吳繼宏、樓後附有廚房四間、大成兩間、中華四間、聚慶隆六間、鼎華六間、商場大門兩間、野玫瑰元和泰六間、美最時兩間、以上爲商場前樓、房係公産、樓後附平房兩間、小巷口茶館一間、路南同和公前樓六間、後房三間、九福市房兩間、後房一間、房主吳光遠、美　市房三間、後房国上間、九章市房三間、後房三間、房主天成公司、又北巷草房三間、計焚去大小八十三間、若就建築費與貨物統計、約數至少達五十萬元以上、特數目字尙待澈底調查、眞浩刦也、滬上國貨旅行團、未受損失、人口則恊同順店員一人被火灼傷尙輕、其有保險者、已經電　報告、火頭則已由當局傳到看管、至火災之善後、大同鎭長副監　已開聯席會議、當與當局恊同進行一切、（九日）</p>

<h3>建立經過</h3>
<p>總理銅像之籌擬建立、尙在七年以前、經海内各藝術家之熱心參中、所得石膏之型模多座、經組審查委員會審查結果、以江小鶼君所塑者獲選、即開始雕塑、嗣以圖事變遷、致稽延甚久、該像原定建立於上海北站前、以便全市人民之瞻仰、且已舉行奠基典禮、旋因一二八戰役突起、北站被毁綦重、當經特委會與市府商洽、改立於市中心區市府大厦後、蓋該地原擬建築一總理紀念堂也、議定後、即着手開築石基、其地位在市府大厦之後方、相距約五十公尺、距紀念堂之地位、亦約似之、現已竣工、純以白石鋪成、銅像則在江君美豐鑄金工場内、製模翻鑄、</p>
<h3>銅像丰度</h3>
<p>銅像高八尺許、下連銅基、四周雕圖案花紋、連基共高約九尺許、總重約一噸、色暗綠、塗以藥水、使光采退去、而呈古銅色、且不致剥落、像係中裝、長衫馬褂、右手持呢帽、左手持竹杖、丰度雖至安逸、但容顔似甚憔悴、蓋此像係於民十三年總理北上過津時所攝、時總理已經數十年奔走革命之過度辛勞、而漸呈衰老矣、瞻仰丰采、可知總理致力革命之偉大精神云、</p>
<h3>昨日移建</h3>

<h3>遼寗救國軍齊占久報告抗日經過　　昨午假大西洋招待新聞界　率所部五萬餘人苦戰兩年</h3>
<p>遼寗救國軍總司令齊占久氏、偕同該部參謀長孫藴武、曁代表竇鄂等、由遼寗前方南旋、於七日抵滬、昨日下午六時、假座大西洋菜社、招待新聞界、報告自九一八事變後、揭櫫義旗、率所部鐵血男兒、與日浴血之經過、兹將報告全文、錄誌如下、</p>
<p>自九一八事變發生後、占久等爲現役軍人、本捍衛邊園之天職、糾合遼省邊防軍、尞南遼西各縣民團、及愛國志士、組織遼寗救國軍、數共五萬餘人、實行抗日工作、苦戰兩年、初編成六師、分駐涇西遼南各縣山林中、相機活動、</p>
<h3>破壞鐵路</h3>
<p>當日寇進窺吉黑及進攻錦州時、占久以第三第四第五三師、專爲破壞營錦鐵路、並恊助省軍扼守打虎山、及阻止敵軍遼河之運船以第一第二第六三師、專事破壞南滿艦路、自瀋陽至海城一綫、截留日寇由大連運來之接濟、並擾亂日人在南滿之根據地、及阻碍藩陽附近統制權之實施、與各縣公路之完成、去歳一月三日、錦州失陷後、占久令各師仍按照原定計劃、繼續工作、同時聯絡盤山西之張海天、（卽老北風、營口附近之盧士傑、安奉綫之鄧鐵梅等部、從事收復遼西遼南已失之各縣、作長期抵抗之根據、幸賴將士奪勇、不數月繼續佔傾盤山·台安·遼中·遼陽·海城·鳳城·牛莊·等縣、此爲抗日以來最盛時期、</p>
<h3>忍痛退守</h3>
<p>今春熱河失守、日寇進侵華北、扼守長城各軍紛起抵抗、占久等乃乘此機會、聯絡各友軍、進攻營口、擬截斷敵軍運輸咽喉、終以敵軍守禦堅固、砲火猛烈、未得成功、入夏後、青紗帳起、沿南滿營錦巡奉各路綫日守備軍、均被占久等部擊斃敗散、北起瀋陽、南至營口、西至盤山、東南至鳳城等縣境内、不見日軍踪跡、中秋後、民間相繼收穫、除山林區域、得藉掩蔽固守、野無長物、敵探偵察極易、未便進展、加以塘沽恊定簽字、日僞軍調增生力軍四師團、以苦戰兩年餘、毫無接濟之孤軍、抵禦新銳之敵、成敗利鈍、可預料矣、乃暫時忍痛放棄血戰所得之各地、退守山林、藉待時機、</p>
<h3>潛伏力量</h3>
<p>張海天部（現歸張子（小北風率領四千餘人、現潛伏於□□縣附近山中、盧世傑部三千餘人、現潛伏於□□沿岸、鄧鐵梅部萬餘人、現分守於□□□迄□□間山中、敝軍全部現退守遼東□□一帶、敝軍自退守後、卽將部隊大加整理、淘汰老弱、揀選精銳、酌編四旅、共一萬六千餘人、槍械齊全、戰馬八千餘匹、並延攬各方救志士、及青年軍人、作嚴格之訓練、期成勁旅、</p>
<h3>僞國實况</h3>
<p>日寇統制下之僞國、各義上雖佔有四省、政令實能行施者、不過沿鐵道線之城鎭而已、距鐵道較遠之僻縣鄉誠、卽非僞國勢力所能達到、僞國政治設施、第一步計劃、卽爲强迫人民栽種鴉片、提倡公開賭博、重收捐稅、	苟延生命、凡日僞力量所及之城鎭、莫不烟館櫛比賭局充斥、而烟館賭局之主人、無不爲日人所主持、暗無天日、不忍卒言、日人所以竭力　迫人民沈迷於烟賭嗜好者、純係麻醉東北民衆、消磨其理智、障落其自强心、日寇更於統轄之各城鎭、裝設電話、利用當地土毫劣紳、作防範義軍之偵察民情之耳目、卑鄙手段、令人髮指、敝軍所到之處、首先禁絶烟賭、破除敝人交通網、與民更始、此固足以表示東北民心之未死、亦敝軍所以能支持兩年於兹之主因也、僞國現有國防軍十五萬人、在遼寗者爲于芷山王殿忠等部、在吉林者爲于仙舟吉興等部、在黑龍江者爲張文　孫　蒼等部、在熱河者爲張海鵬等部、各軍均由日人監視指揮、所有士兵、平日不發一彈、每於臨陣時、始按名發放、因日寇對僞軍始終不信任、惟恐僞軍反正、防範無微不至、然僞軍在此情形之下、反正之心、並未全消、如最近于芷山機關槍連連長張旭東、率全連反正、投　綫軍、卽一例也、</p>
<h3>今後願望</h3>
<p>占元等此次進關、覺全國空氣甚爲沈悶、前度愛國高潮、頓已消沉、須知東北四省乃中華民國之生命線、豈忍長視其任人宰割、而無切膚之痛乎、袁莫大於心死、血與涙俱、夫復何言、近觀弱小之土耳其、尙有復國之凱米爾、龐大之華夏、並無一中興之拿破崙、占久等自信政府諸公、老成謀國、宵旰辛勞、收復失土之計劃、必早經籌之熟矣、况東北民衆及僞軍士卒、不甘壓迫、時望政府出兵收復失地、如大旱之盼靈冕、尤望全國民衆、振作自强之精神、剷除苟安觀念、上下同心、至死不屈、作外交之後盾、爲反攻之凖備、更以餘力援助關外、義軍、勿使愛國志士、爲敵消滅、一旦日俄大戰爆發、我軍出長城、可制勝强敵、義軍在關外、亦可擾亂敵軍後方、互爲聲援、破壞日僞交通、僞軍必能聞風響應、則失地之重得恢復、直指顧問事耳、唯望國人竭忠盡智、毁家紓難、國家民族之存亡、在此一舉、占久等以身許國、矢志抗日、暫當再接再厲、有以報國人也、</p>
<h3>海港檢疫處昨晚四週年宴　伍連德詳述檢疫工作</h3>
<p>海港檢疫處昨晚七時、在東亞酒樓、舉行第四週年宴、到衛牛署長劉瑞恒·招商局總理劉鴻生·市商會長王曉籟·袁禮敦·李廷安·董顯光·及各國使領館代表等百餘人、當由該處處長伍連德博士等殷勤招待、席間、首由衛生署長劉瑞恒致辭後即由伍連德詳述該處工作經過及近狀、最後由派克博士及勃郎君演說、至十時許、賓主始盡歡而散、兹紀伍連德氏演辭於次、</p>
<p>今日蒙諸位貴賓惠然責臨、實深榮幸、諸公酬酢繁忙、乃竟撥冗光降、足勸諸公關心敝處之進展、敝處一切工作、端賴各方予以恊助及指導、否則敝處决不能有若何進步也、對於今晚與宴之國聯代表、鄙人講代表敝處向彼等表示感謝蓋在過去四年中、若無國聯衛生部之恊助、敝處定不能有如是之成績、尤以國聯續生部長拉西曼博士出力爲多、鄙人不僅對彼致謝、并乘機致賀、蓋彼已榮　新命、被派爲國聯技術合作代表、及全國經濟委員會顧問、此後不僅我國蒙受其益、卽世界經濟前途、亦將大放光明、國聯衛生部與敝處之合作、因有星加坡東方衛生事務局之聯絡、乃得更以顯者、今晚飭局局長派克博士亦在座中、鄙人謹對彼表示謝意、彼自任職以來、對於敝處之進展、至爲關心、目曾予以充分之恊助、在報告敝處工作以前、鄙人仍有一點須待聲明、卽總稅務司梅樂和爵士各外領、公共租界工部局衛生處法工部局衛生處、上海市衛生局、李斯德研究院、及各航業界領袖、均與敝處以無上便利、并與之合作、敝處如欲盡其職務端賴本埠各公私機關之熱誠恊助、此後職務範圍日廣、則是項之互助、仍將隨之推進無已也兹將本年工作概况略述如下、</p>
<p>鼠蚤研究　鄙人嘗聞人言、海港檢疫并非要政、甚目謂其功效、祇在使闊别之夫妻遲遲見面、此種誤解、毋庸置辯、今請進言敝處最重要工作之一部、卽係在滬漢津厦粤各處進行鼠類及鼠蚤之檢查、是項研究之目的有二、第一、吾人對於上述各埠鼠之種類及其寄生物、極欲得一可靠之張本、第二、吾人根據此種張本、可求得　鼠疫傳染之相互關係、因此疫常有隨船貨侵入之可能、在十九世紀末葉、曾由印度侵入我國南部、繼入台灣及日本、故汕頭厦門福州香港廣州等埠、均被侵入、獨上海及揚子流域、未遭其禍、惟一九零八年十月三十日、漢口曾發現一華人染鼠疫、此人本寓上海、此後上海即間有鼠瘟及輕微疫症發現、故在敝處總醫官指導之下、從事是項鼠蚤研究、將來所得之結果、頗堪注意、兩年以來、計共檢騐鼠類二千頭、均由沿岸捕來者Senopyila　Cheoprs類鼠蚤、乃傳播鼠疫最良之媒介、據檢查所得、惟該項疫蚤、祇在晚夏及秋委較多、其指數在一之下、此種港區所得之數目、與城區所得、是否符合、尚不可知在最近將來、吾人擬推廣檢查範圍至住宅區及商業區、其他各埠檢查所得之結果、與本埠相較顯然、不同、疫蚤全年繁殖、廣州與夏門兩埠所獲之鼠蚤、幾全爲疫蚤、鄙人不得不感謝碼頭及貨棧各主人、因彼等允許入内繼續捕鼠故也、</p>
<h3>霍亂狀况</h3>
<p>在過去數年中、敝處因主管上海臨時防止霍亂所事務、乃成一總聯絡機關、對於霍亂一症、吾人現竭力進行各項化騐研究、以期將此惡疫、根本掃除、本埠去年患霍亂者有四千人以上、今年則無一人、以全國計、去年患者約十萬人、今夏祇有六人、下相屆年宴時、鄙人或可將研究所得、作一報告、今夏本埠雖未有眞性霍亂發現、但仍有患痢疾傷寒水瀉者、據公共租界工部局衛生處報告、計患假霍亂水瀉者有二十八人、患腸胃炎者有四八五人、</p>
<h3>船隻檢騐</h3>
<p>本部份工作、因外界間有誤會、頗不易進行、當各項船隻從有疫口　進口時、檢疫工作、至爲案要、因此發生煩擾、亦所不免、鄙人有一點敢告航業界諸君、卽敝處并不採取何種新政策、惟知遵守國際通規、對於應施檢疫疫症、積極防範、努力避免妨害航業、因全世界之不景氣、本埠及其他各埠進口之船隻、數目頓爲銳减、船隻受檢騐者、不如去年之多、但總噸位乃相差無幾、本年沿江海各埠、未發現天花及霍亂流行、因之檢騐數目、亦隨以俱减、一九三三年十個月内、共檢騐船隻一九五四艘、總噸位爲一二·五五二·五七九去年同時、則有一九六九艘、總噸位爲一二五七六四一四、以國籍計、今年檢騐者、英籍六零二艘、即百分之三二·五、（總噸位四·五七九·一七四、）日籍六二八艘、卽百分之在三·九、（總噸三零七四·一二）美籍二零八艘、卽是分之一一·三、（總噸二·二二）</p>
<p>九、）哪喴籍一一一艘、德籍八七艘、丹麥籍五○艘、法籍三四艘、中國籍三五艘、嗬囒籍三二艘、意大利籍二○艘、瑞典籍一二艘、巴拿馬籍六艘、智利籍四艘、怡臘籍五艘、蘇俄籍一三艘、敝處檢騐人員、與各船員感情均極融洽、此則鄙人所引爲深幸者也、</p>
<h3>船隻蒸薰　爲遂守一九二六年公佈之</h3>
<p>萬國衛生公約起見、敝處蒸薰科、在本年内、曾蒸薰巨數之船隻、内有外洋巨輪貨船江海各輪及駁船等、關於防鼠方法、亦竭力指導、薰船數目列下</p>

<p>分所概况　上屆年宴時、鄙人對於各埠檢疫分所工作概况、曾有簡單報告、今請略述厦門分所工作成績、因除上海分所外、該所乃一最重要之分所、在一九三一年正月前、該所檢疫工作、乃由海關僱用私家醫生擔任、對於出口移民種痘、及進口船隻檢騐、均須收費、但并無醫院、以備收容病人、吾人接收後、蒙本地長官撥給沿海公地一大方、當即開始進行建築隔離醫院、於是年冬委、該院即告工竣、同時適逢天花大流行、收容病人不少、去年全國霍亂流行、該院工作頗形緊張、計受接種者有二萬人、在受治療之一九七病人中、死亡者有四九人、該埠原有移民所一處、惜地點不佳、乃議定重建新所一處、及頭等病等一座、此項新建築、皆由向飽私　之種痘費及檢騐費内開支、本年九月三十日、鄙人親往東行開幕典禮、本地長官領國、及航業界人士、均出席參加、英國領事并移交支票一紙、計洋八千餘元、係舊移民所捐欵餘數、鄙人對於中外各方熱心協助、不得不表示感謝、華北各分所、因時局關係、工作方面、稍感困難、惟仍照原定計劃努力進行、漢口一埠、蒸薰工作、頗有進展、現决將該埠分所工作範圍、略事擴充、由以上之簡單報告、可見鄙人頗注重研究及調查兩方面之工作、蓋醫學亦如其他科學、并非恒靜而不動、關於防止疫病侵入各口岸、吾人對於有關我國及其他各國之各項預防問題、均予以相當注意、鄰人甚望在數年後、對於疫病流行問題、能有更進一步之解决焉、</p>

<h3>經濟信用合作社今晨開幕昨招待記者　由總經理丘漢平報告　産生背景及利厚原因</h3>

<h3>産生背景</h3>
<p>我國自鴉片戰爭以來、列强輸入量商品、使我國固有之生産制度、盡皆崩壞、同時我國新興工業、又因受其壓迫而無法發展、致農村破産、人民失業、生活痛苦、幾不勝枚舉、日常生活、已不易應付、而智識份子、皆苦於無業可就、數量卽縱能謀得一業、亦皆朝不保暮、時嘆失業、負擔家累、更感困難、生前則兒女敎育、常苦張羅、身後則妻子生活、大堪憂慮、至精神生活、更無暇計及、同人鑒於今日人民痛苦如斯、亟思有以解除之、乃有本社之設、</p>
<h3>入社手續</h3>
<p>加入手續、至爲簡單、塡入社志願書、納入社金一元、此與普通社團無異、所異者、每月須儲蓄若干耳、此每月儲蓄若干、爲社友之基本義務、社友必須盡此義務、方能享受一切權利、本利十五年期全份（滿其　千元）儲金、月不過五元、日省一角七分、卽可認儲全份、又有五分之一份、五分之三份、能日省二分三或一角者、則月得一元或三元、亦可認儲、另有五年十年兩種、使時間縮减、如一次整儲、則手續更簡、至認儲份數、亦可視認儲者之經濟能力而而加、惟每人所儲、至多以五份爲限、</p>
<h3>入社利益</h3>
<p>社友人社以後自消費娱樂以至臨時需要、自失業疾病以至養老、自兒女敎育以至身後、皆有適當之救濟辦法、是一入本社、不啻畢生生活、皆有保障、人生重要問題、不期然而盡獲解决矣</p>
<h3>優厚原因</h3>
<p>顧或有疑之者、本社何以能予社友以許多利益、爲普通儲蓄保壽所未有、其遺可得聞乎、不知本社所以能予社友以許多利益、其理至顯、一則合作之旨、使社友能自助互助、再則謀社友直接利益、不爲本身謀利益、年來滬上儲蓄銀行保壽公司、發達甚速、獲利甚豐、其所以付賠欵者、不過利用保壽者之互助而已、其所以付息分紅者、亦不過運用儲壽者之資金而已、去零星之欵、存入銀行、得息至微、銀行集此零星之欵、或放欵或投資、一轉手之間、卽獲巨利、合作社與普通銀行公司、性質不同、彼不謀本身之利益與股東之紅利、而在謀社友之直接利益、舉凡儲蓄銀行壽險公司股東之利益、一一歸諸社友自身、故社友所享利益、遠非普通保壽儲蓄所能及、此外各種娱樂設備、醫藥體育顧問、法律升學旅行指導、在個人經濟能力、固不能一一爲之、在本社則集千百社友之力以營之、則個人負擔之數、渺乎其徵、初不之覺也、</p>

<p>運動概觀</p>
<h3>團操體</h3>
<p>昨日團體操　共舉行五十五節、如比德之盾牌操、表演中日戰爭、上海上學之彩旗操、花様百出、羣事會之聾啞操不用口令、唐灣小學低年級之娃娃兵、嫩腿畢露、游龍舞舞態翩躚、林蔭之字操、疊成林蔭小學讀書救國八字、殊爲難能、其他如草塘之徒手操、和安之短棒操、蒿竹之跳、箱表演、俱屬精彩、幼琟生以上海幼稚園之小工人、民智之小農夫、寓生産敎育之意義、隆德之國旗操、唐灣之割稻舞、羣學會之小英雄、更别饒興趣、</p>

<p>田徑賽昨日已完成男子各組鉛球及甲及粗跳高跳遠、女子甲粗百米等四項决賽、男子各組百米亦已入决賽關頭、惟二日來之成績、尙無新紀錄發現、男甲跳遠萬竹朱洪琪成績五米四十六、與保持紀錄者賈幼良之成績、頗爲接近、男子甲組八百米預賽、原爲精采節目、祇以開始時已鐘鳴五下、暮色蒼茫中已難辨認矣、男子百米甲組决賽、西成胡開後、滬北曹家寳、成績相近、必有劇烈競爭、</p>
<h3>會場花絮</h3>
<h3>保衛團　拉夫甚忙</h3>
<p>南區保衛團在場、服務頗忙、運動場外學生休息處、許多販夫走卒、爭賣五香豆花生米、一般小學生肚子甚餓、爭相購食、惟小販售物不爲會規所許、保衛團丁東西奔走、見一個、拉一個、煞是有趣、冠生▲活潑可愛的小學（啟昌攝）</p>
<p>園食品處以特許設置、不在取締之列、故生意興隆、</p>
<h3>過磅處　賽員卸甲</h3>
<p>參加田徑賽運動員、各校當局以求勝心切、頗多不依規定、以甲組冒充乙組、乙組冒充丙組丙組、尤於徑賽中時常發現身材高大之冒充貨、在丙組中奪得錦標、評判員勿放心、再行過磅、俱超過八十磅以上、取銷資格、一時過磅處生意熱閙、小學生頗爲乖巧、過磅時卸去外衣、赤足裸身、惟所差有限、依然掃興而返、</p>
<h3>幼稚生服裝離奇</h3>
<p>各校幼稚生之服裝、五光十色、各有巧妙、而以萬竹幼稚園最貴族化、俱係紅黑絲羢製成、西成及尙文則由鄢聲工業社特製國貨羊毛衫、亦頗摩登、最樸素者表演小農夫之民智幼稚生、上身穿藍士林布農夫裝、下紥土布圍裙、肩背笠帽、脚踏草鞋、儼然一農人模様、可謂翹然特異、</p>
<h3>秦志學　標凖美人</h3>
<p>萬竹小學體育指導、員秦志報女士、畢業於東南女體專、任萬竹指導有年、接連已參加三屆小學運動軍、肌肉白凈而結實、大有徐來之風、羣衆都呼之爲標準美人、上午穿咖啡色旗袍、足登革履、下午出操時、換上白色運動上衣、灼灼有光、衣邊綴有英女字一行、短裙之下露出大腿、誠一運動健將也</p>

<p>春秋</p>
<h3>「古已有之」與「外國也有的」</h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>現在中國有兩句很通行的話兒：一是「古已有之」，一是「外國也有的」。這好像是兩條軌道並設着，舉凡一切的，不趨於此，則趨於彼。所以雖然明知冷猪肉已没有福再吃了，而孔廟還是非保存不可；否則，便是「絶聖」！這就是因爲孔廟，「古已有之」的緣故。「蜜絲」與小姐，「對不起」與「賒來」Sorry，本都是一而二，二而一的；然而你如果要說得漂亮些，那末小姐似呼應當改稱「蜜絲」，而「對不起」也似乎非改說「賒來」不可了。这太是因爲「蜜絲」與「賒來」二個名詞，「名國也有的」緣的。略舉數例，已足證「古已有之」與「外國也有的」這兩句話，的確未可小視了。</p>
<p>孟老夫子說：「出則無適國外患者，」國𠈗亡」。不錯。這委實不但「古已已之」，就是「外國也有的」。十年生聚，十年敎訓，勾踐卒以沼吳。這是「古已有之」。普法戰爭，法割亞兩薩斯及洛林二州與普，可是不到五十年，歐洲起了大戰爭，法國的失地，終能在一九一八年收回。這是「外國也有的」。惟其如此，所以横直國家没有敵國外患，也要亡的；那末卽使土地喪失，大家儘可放心，自然隅了十年或數十年，可以收復，何秘心急！提起胡立夫，大家要疾首痛心的；然而「漢奸」，「古已有之」。就把明朝來說：「洪武十六六年六月，夷船一十八隻寇金鄉小濩塞，官兵敵郤之。明年，胡惟庸僞差盧州人李旺充宜使以還，林賢……與僧如瑶來獻巨燭，中藏火藥兵器，圖謀亂逆：比至，惟庸被誅，朝廷治其逆黨，處賢極刑」。詳見顧亭林天下羣國利病書論海外諸番篇。胡惟庸與林賢都是「漢奸」：這不是「古已有之」？所以「漢奸」終不可爲而爲。</p>
<p>「統制」卽「剛德落耳」Control，「奬劵」卽「落得來」Lottery。還有好多好多的外國新鮮名詞逐漸或正將源源而來。這雖不能說「古已有之」，然而外國也有的」。「古已有之」，已足使人心服；何况「名國也有的」，自然更没有什麽可說了。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十八回　脈脈傳茶含悲慰夫婿　怱怱出寨强笑别家人</p>
<p>不過雖是半遮了他的臉，趙自强還看得出來，不由得喊了一聲道：這不是街東頭的老劉嗎？老劉跳下車來，放了手上的鞭子，比着兩手深深的向他作的兩個揖道：趙連長，你瞧，這怎麽辦？我一家子都指望着我這一輛車，兩頭牲口，城裏海甸，兩頭兒跑。現在全帶來了，怎麽辦？我以爲您是不認得我啦，我幾回想呌您，我又怕會犯罪，不敢呌出來，你認得我，那就好啦，我家裏還有一個八十歳的老娘，你是知道的。說着說着，他索興跪下去了，和趙自强磕了三個頭。趙自强見他轉動着眼珠，兩行眼涙，差不多要哭出來。便伸手將他攙扶起來。自己正想說一句，再作商罷。可是一看後面，還有四輛被拉來的大車，緊緊的跟隨着。自然，每輛車上，都也坐了一名夫子，都睜了大眼，望着老劉呢。於是硬了心腸，正着臉色道：你這不是廢話，我若是可以放你，我還把你找來作什麽？你跟我們走一趟，也不虧你，走一天，有一天的錢。老劉磕了兩個頭，倒落了一個說廢話的批評，只好忍住那把眼涙，站了起來，依然坐上車去趕車，趙自强帶着司務長，索興坐了五車，一鞭跑回了大營，他走回連部的時候，迎面正遇了田青，他笑道：你究竟比我好。回家瞧一趟愛人去了。趙自强什麽話也没有說，重重的唉了一聲。田青笑道：怎麽様？老丈母娘有什麽不滿意的話嗎？趙自强道：唉！那倒不是，可是……說着，左手取下了軍帽，右手在頭上撫摸了一番，表示他那種躊躇而無可如何的神氣來。（二三七）</p>
<h3>離鄉病與都市病</h3>
<p>— 惟經</p>
<p>誰都不能在初踏進這個都市的時候，不感到孤零寂寞，詛咒着一切環境，一切似乎都在對自己嘲笑的環境。而一日思家十二回。不錯，每一個初踏進這個都市者，都有這一種病象，據說，叫做「離鄉病」。</p>
<p>「離鄉病」並不是一種不治之症，並没有「相思病」那麽嚴重，而且也不用請中醫開方，西醫打針，儘不會有性命出入的。唯一的治療方法，便是利用着餘暇，到各處去追求了「解個悶兒」的所在。在都會裏「解個悶兒」的所在，是比甚麽都充足而完備。其中輪得到頭兒腦兒，翹得大拇指兒的，自然是該輪到「跳舞塲」。在跳舞塲裏，有的是蕩人的粉靨與大腿，醉人的香檳與啤酒。在被遮掩了强烈的電燈光下，在樂而不淫，哀而不怨的爵士聲中，儘會失去了你整個靈魂，而此間樂，不思蜀矣。</p>
<p>不上跳舞塲，那麽請你進影戲院去解個悶兒。或是上公園，也行。在影戲院裏，在公園裏，假使你鴻運當頭，桃花星坐命的話，凖會不用你去追逐，而自有女性來追逐你。就是退一百步言，没有女性來追逐你的話，那麽，在那些去處，機會是很多的，若是你並不是柳下惠，魯男子。</p>
<p>遊戲場。比了跳舞場，影戲院，公園，自然已是在鄶之下的了，但是爲了「解個悶兒」，也未始不是一個好去處。在那裏，一様有迷人的，醉人的一切一切，而且誘惑性的成分，比較的更加濃厚。而更其是患離鄉病者的對症良藥。</p>
<p>再說得簡而易行些，那麽，在幾條熱閙市街上溜溜，也已夠有味的了，而更其是在夜間，在那些有名的神秘之街上溜。在那些神秘之街上，你儘可領略到「異國情調」。若是你有興而跨進中國的頽廢詩人所常到的咖啡座，那你或許會認識到所謂「南國風味」者，究竟是怎麽一回事。</p>
<p>這些，這些，都足以治愈你的不能排遣的「離鄉病」，但是，不治的「都市病」，同時已在開始把你的靈魂，埋進墳墓去</p>
<h3>記粤人梁某事</h3>
<p>— 金孑</p>
<p>第一先要聲明，我自己是一個迷信因果之說的「時代落伍者」；可是時代儘管把我抛落，其如在我所眼前所發生的事實，却儘自望我的思想這邊傾瀉過來，於是因果循環之說，越發給我抓得堅牢了。不信，請看下文丨</p>
<p>有一位姓梁的廣東人，名字暫不發表。不過他是在上海兩路管理局服務的，要查訊也不難。他雖然年紀已是很大了，可是食慾却非常亢進，廣東人本來最歡喜吃，而且歡喜吃得古怪，如三蛇禾蟲之類，别處人所不敢染指的，他們偏是愛吃得像性命一様。梁某的食慾尤比一般廣東人强，所入也不薄，因此便志心朝禮的儘量考究吃，其中尤以生吃甲魚一味爲最特别。甲魚一名水魚，本地人吃的也很多，廣東人是更不用說了，但是像梁某的生吃，恐伯是很難得邑。其法先把一頭甲魚餵養得很肥很飽滿了，然後用水把安洗得乾乾凈凈，梁某便一手抓住甲魚，一手執刀，刀光起處，甲魚的頭已齊頸而落，梁某便把它顚倒提了起來，就用自己的嘴含着甲魚的斷頸，用力吮吸其鮮血。這時候，甲魚還不曾全死，四條脚没命的在殻外亂動亂划，恰和梁某嘴裏所發出來的嘖嘖之聲相應。待到他把甲魚的血吸完，甲魚的脚也不動了。這且不在話下。</p>
<p>單說到了今年春天，菜花甲魚上市了，梁某不由食指大動，正想大吃一頓，</p>
<p>不料他自己的頭頸裏，突然生了一個毒瘡，潰爛不堪，請醫生一看，說是最凶的「落頭疽，」要救治惟有開刀。於是梁某的入院開刀。不料醫生輕輕一刀開下去，他的頭便隨刀而落。齊頸而斷，鮮血望外面直冒，正和他所施之於甲魚的情形一般無二。</p>
<p>事情就是這様完了。</p>
<h3>電影作風的傾向</h3>
<p>— 李景賢</p>
<p>電影之在咱們中國，雖然不過只有十多年，可是它在現在，無疑地，已成爲咱們最有力量的利器了。</p>
<p>它那作風的轉變，從遞嬗上搜尋它那演進的痕跡，可以找得到這一些：丨丨</p>
<p>在最初，當然是脫不了「滑稽」「胡閙」的幼穉成分。後來，有人知道是可以利用作爲開濬人們智慧源泉的。於是它乃被人視爲普及平民敎育的工作，但作風上終不免有些類似說敎方式的遺憾。再到後來，武俠的潮汐是像狂流般在銀海已瀾，而不幸的神怪的浪花更掩襲混進這高潮的重圍，使光明的銀海給擾得發生暗影成爲漆黑一團。</p>
<p>可是這隂翳不久又消散了它的影蹤，中國電影作風的傾向。乃另進了一重新的境界。</p>
<p>這境界是傾向着咱們大衆的。它不復再作人們的單純娱樂品，將更進一步爲咱們陷在疾苦中的大衆呐喊，覺醒，覺醒這一羣在迷途中尋找不到出路的羔羊</p>
<p>聞說明星新片「鐵板紅涙錄」·在那裏邊缀成的畫面全是些粗壯的線條。這線條能夠充分地描畫出那過去的軍閥以苛捐雜稅荼毒人民的罪惡，與那革命種子在爆發前夜中藴釀的緊張姿態。</p>
<p>記着，這作風的傾向是站在咱們一方面的。</p>

<p>服裝特刋　第十期</p>
<h3>與讀者告别</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>本刋自九月九日起，出版今天，恰已十期。在這短短的兩個多月中，我們自問很少有什麽成績；但是我們總算達到了兩個目的，一，提倡國貨衣料，二，衣服大衆化。我們固然不敢自誇這服裝特刋，有多大的能力與功效；但是我們也不自諱，在這兩個多月中，國貨衣服，的確因爲本刋的提倡而越覺流行。還有衣服的式様，雖然我們也造過新頴而合於衛生的式様，但是旗袍上（大衆化衣服）不窮極奢麗的裝飾，而只鑲一邊滾，袍子夾裏上不鑲花邊等瑣屑之處，却也很流行了，這是可以减輕裁製費的負但不少。</p>
<p>我們深覺各人家庭裏的服裝費，大概女子要佔到百分已七十至八十；我們更相信，如果女太太們都瞭解國貨衣料是這様的價廉物美，那就可以使每年三萬萬元的洋貨漏巵，受到一個極大的打擊：同時人我們更希望大衆的衣服，要合於「經濟」「衛生」美化三個原則。</p>
<p>現在天氣已凉，大家對於冬季的衣服，也大都早已籌妥，所以同人們想乘這時期中·作一結束，將來如果再有機會，或者再繼續出版，也未可知？同時本刋已與美亞織綢廠，章華呢絨公司，鴻新染織廠，以及鴻翔服裝公司約定，如如讀者對於服裝方面，有什疑問，不妨逕自寫信給他們任何一家，詳細地問，他們一定狠熱忱地告訴你們所要知道的一切，假使衣料是完全國貨的話。</p>
<h3>本星期服裝變動消息　編者報告</h3>
<p>在這一個星期中，我們在公衆地方，可以瞧見許多女子的旗袍，已比從前稍短。從前的旗袍，長得拖曳到地，下擺是拖得狠髒，而且會拖破。現在呢，大概只及到踝骨爲止。</p>
<p>今年有一径大衣式様，不但狠新，而且是美觀。背脊上都打一個大襇，而在前胸的兩旁，也各打一襇，在下擺的左右下部，也打一個襇，所以穿在身上，也狠舒服。</p>
<p>最近汪精衛先生說，高級的人員，應該穿馬褂。所以男子的馬褂又時髦起來了，大概用國貨黑毛葛做的居多。</p>

<p>一連幾天、夫人　像做了馬路上的巡閱使，到處給伊的丈夫物色西裝衣料。一天傍晚，伊興高采烈地挾着一個挺大的囊兒趕回家去，手舞足蹈的對伊丈夫說道：「好了好了，我已給你辦到一身上好的衣料來了，你瞧了，包管你一定滿意。」邊說邊將囊兒打開，雙手托過一疊光潔可愛的西服呢來，直送到Ｃ君的眼前。Ｃ君先很不經意似的看了一眼，臉色上已有一分滿意。再將兩個指頭拈了一下，臉色上就有三分滿意。又拉住了衣料的一角，用力的把兩手對搓起來。臉色上頓時有了九分滿意。最後更整件的拿起托在兩手掌上頓了一頓，臉色上便有了十二分的滿意，歡天喜地的嚷着道：「吾愛吾愛！這料子你從那裏買來的？我瞧這一定的德國名廠的出品，任任一國都製不出這様的道地貨，我找了好久，没有找到，却偏偏落你在的手中，眞是得來全不費工夫了。」夫人笑道：「象這様的料子，我原知道你見了一定滿意，我是從一位德國朋友那裏商讓來的。」Ｃ君拍手歡呼道：「可不是麽？可不是麽？我畢竟是個德國通，一瞧就知道是德國貨，若是我會看錯，儘可抉我的眸子去。」夫人一聽這話，便吃吃的笑將起來，眞笑得前仰後合，連眼涙都笑了出來。Ｃ君忙道：「你笑甚麽？我說出算數，要是錯的話，誰都可以抉我的眸子。」夫人邊笑邊揩着眼涙，連連點頭道：「好好好，你坐着不要動，待我來抉你的眸子。」說時，從桌上取了一柄小刀子，徒到Ｃ君跟前，當下却霍地把刀子放下，低頭和和接了一個易道：「親愛的，我不來抉你掉的眸子，還是來撬開你這洋迷迷的心竅吧。要知這料子並不是甚麽德國貨，實實在在是你們中華民國的國貨。」Ｃ君訝然道：「怎麽說？我們中國會造得出這様道地的西服呢來麽？無論如何，我不敢相信。」夫人道：「你敢再再嘴　，那我不但要抉你的眸子，還要剪掉你的舌了咧。委實和你說，這的的確確的你們的國貨，我在南京路山用玄色美氅縐製時裝，兩袖口荷葉邊式，袖口相近，開腰圓孔，露出皓臂，身肥者御此，極莊重而美觀。</p>
<p>東路口一家呢絨鋪子　買來的。據夥伴們說，這是章華毛絨紡織公司的出品，呌做錦羊毛牌章華呢，貨包旣高妙，價錢又便宜，你不信，我不妨伴你一同去看，正有許多同様的東西，陳列在那家鋪子裏，那鋪子裏的名字，也就呌做章華。」Ｃ君還是不肯輕信，將那料子重又細細的看了一看，拈了一拈，搓了一搓，頓了一頓，以驚又喜的說道：「這眞奇了，我們没出息的中國，會造得出這様道地的西服呢，又江潔，又細密，色澤旣好，質地又堅，委實可和道地的德國貨不相上下，從此我只能算是一個盲目者，再也不敢小視我們的任何國貨了。我并且要發一個誓，從今天起，我要掬着一百二十分的誠意，愛我中國，并愛我中國的國貨。」</p>
<p>於是Ｃ君就給他夫人醫可了根深蒂固的洋迷病，一變而爲熱情的愛國者，和愛用一切國貨的一份子。</p>

<h3>衣服美觀與適體之原則</h3>
<p>— 琴知</p>
<p>吾國自軒轅氏創造衣服以來，垂四千餘年，其間時有變遷，長短寛窄，屢見更易，良以衣服一道，旣須隨時代之進化，以創審美之式様，更宜合衛生之原旨，而求適體之製裁，此不獨蔽體禦寒已也。晚近科學昌明，人之智力，亦隨之而增强，舉凡一事一物，無不興利除弊，删陋就新，况衣爲人生四要之首，其須力謀改革，實爲他項更爲重要，是故歐西各國，對於衣服一項，日事研究，不遺餘力，而製服家之於製裁，尤各鬥智較力，互相競爭，反顧吾國之製服家，祇知因循舊法，旣無專鬥學識，更少相當經騐，遑論審美與適體，殊不知吾人衣服之合式與否，第一當視其製裁之良否定之，質料之貴賤，尙其次者也，試以綢緞呢絨價貴之料，苟製裁不得其法，不僅有失美觀，適足引起人之厭憎，反之土布價賤之料，如能製裁得宜，不僅助美增妍，亦合乎衛生之原旨，譬之庖司煮菜，不論其爲園蔬素菜，祗須烹調得宜，何者宜鹹，何者宜甜，何者宜加香味，何者宜加辣料，則一茶之成，較之山珍錯海，實有過之無不及。反之山珍海錯，若烹調不得其法，則原料雖貴，而其味猶同嚼蠟，豈不可惜，以彼例此，故衣服之於製裁，其重要爲何如耶？鴻翔公司專製婦女各式服裝，上考前代相沿之古式，遠搜歐西改良之新法，去其蕪陋，存其精華，再聘以專門人材，加以借襯法，配色學，不論質料爲綢爲布，皆能得心應手。該公司兹因竭力爲婦女界服務起見，凡有以國貨衣料，向該公司詢問一切者，該公司皆樂於答復云。</p>
<h3>長期抵抗與布衣運動</h3>
<p>近聞日本人預料，一九三六至三七年，世界各國，一定要大單，正在興奮國民心理，呌人民節省金錢，預備支持大戰三年。我國瘡痍未復，世界戰爭，一旦爆發，財才兩空，有何能力可以參加，故在此國難期間，（假定爲五年）對於一切物力，應該竭力撙節，即即有餘之家，因節省財力而穿着布衣，亦復何傷大雅，人人具誓死抵抗之心，人人有雪恥復仇之念，威可徼天之幸，圖萬一之生存，以本日之强，至今尙有國貨振興委員會，調查全國購買洋貨，還有一百四十幾種，研究結果，其中一百二十種洋貨，日本尙有國貨可代用，還有二十幾種，無物可代，吾國人何并此日用所需之衣服，亦必洋貨是尚，苟非喪心病狂，何忍出此，此服用布衣爲長期抵抗之說也。</p>
<p>農村之苦，達於極點，水災以後，繼以兵災，去年幸告無事，而米麥價賤，糶不値錢，然而租賦之完納如故，次債之索逋如故，欲售耕種之田，而受主無人，欲典押家中所有，而當典閉歇，强暴男子，流爲匪類，小至鼠竊狗偷，大則打家刦舍綁票爲生，女子之年輕者，盡到上海薦頭店去，帮傭度日，田荒地白，家破人亡，目擊心傷，有非筆墨所能形容者，今土布運動會之宗旨，直接提倡國産，抵抗仇貨，間接即所以救濟農村，紡紗織布，本爲鄉村農事閒暇之副業，吾蘇各地，類能爲之，惟以洋布盛行，東三省之土布銷路，又爲敵國所侵奪，手工生産，僅有絶無，今苦加以提倡，四萬萬人在國難内，咸服布衣，則一人每年用土布四疋，即有十六萬萬疋銷路，土布織工，每疋以三角計，農民即有四萬八千萬元之收入，公家從何處籌得此偌大巨欵以救濟農村哉，並且紡織技能，農婦素所嫻習，不煩僱匠敎導之煩，紡織器具農家固有，無庸籌集開辦之巨欵，各就家庭，加增副産，仍可養育子女，治理家政，而無離鄉背井朝去暮回工廠生活之苦况，提倡土布之利益，孰有過於此者，惟提倡不難，難於銷路，一人之力有限，必賴四萬萬人同發願心，服用土布，方可成功，吾觀每逢各處災害，籌集振欵，凡吾同胞，無不踴躍輸將，以其有益於災民也。今若服用土布。旣可抵制劣貨，表示愛國，又所購之布，即爲救濟農村之欵，人亦何樂而不爲哉。吾願愛國男女，不但自己服用土布，并且普勸同胞樂購土布，多着一件布衣即多救農家一命，此救濟農村尤不可提倡布衣之說也。</p>
<p>際此提倡國發期間，愛國志土，無不爲國産品倡導宣傳，大河不擇細流，羣峯基於土壤，農村土布，關係手工副業匪細，苟蒙提倡服用，未始非抵制劣貨一法也。</p>
<h3>我之服裝談</h3>
<p>— 潘衡若</p>
<p>服裝是　　癜　，無取乎　耀，更力避其奢　華，我們女子的最大消耗，要算服裝一項。東鄰李女士一年衣料所耗，約需四五千金；西鄰王女士·一年裁製時裝費，只是工錢一項，要費一千餘元，這種情形，令人爲之咋舌不置，其實一個人要漂亮行爲，漂亮心性，漂亮言語，漂亮學問；至於衣服一項，只須是國貨，是文雅，隨在可以顯出漂亮，何必定要買外國貨，着歐美綢緞，買外國花様，後　作梁　呢？依我看來，服裝要點，在潔凈，在樸素，在文雅，而尤在耐穿，我的一年服裝費，　　是五十元，最配我胃口的一是綢緞丨國貨綢緞，爲中國的國焠，價廉物美，人人歡迎，美亞出品，足以當之。</p>
<p>一是布疋丨國貨布疋，更其是中國的國魂，樸素文雅，加以潔淨，是人人高興穿着的，止下　新染織　　出品，適合　　　　，在這國貨年中，繼行起來，可以風行全國。</p>
<p>我　在夏天歡喜穿綢緞衣裳以外，此　　秋冬三季，終是穿着布衣，所以鴻新布，美亞綢，是我的老主顧，我願姊妹門大家來試試看。</p>

<h3>從三燈收音機改到三燈發音機</h3>
<p>— 朱紫源</p>
<p>諸位如果已有一隻一級檢波二級低週波放大的三燈收音機的話，那末要改成一隻三燈發音機，並不困難，而且所添的另一件也不多，假如諸位對於發音有興味的，祇要拿來改裝一下，一變收音而爲發音，豈不有趣。</p>
<p>下面是介紹改裝的方法，爲說明便利起見，僅　丨or燈作例。如果是交流子</p>
<p>的，也可同法改裝，大同小異。</p>
<p>線路圖及說明如下：</p>
<p>ＣＣ１是·○○○五兆分法拉活動電容器</p>
<p>Ｃ２是·○○三兆分法拉固定電容器</p>
<p>Ｃ３是·○○○二五兆分法拉固定電容器</p>
<p>Ｌ是調節綫圈</p>
<p>ＲＦＣ是高週波塞流圈，用二時直徑膠管，二十八號絲包線繞二百圈。</p>
<p>ＬＦＣ是低週波塞流圈可用斷了初級圈的低週波變壓代用（用牠的次級）線路圖</p>
<p>Ｒ是一萬歐姆的固定電阻</p>
<p>Ｒr是六歐姆可變電阻</p>
<p>Ｔ是低週波變壓器</p>
<p>Ｔ是調幅變壓器，可用低週波變壓器代。</p>
<p>Ｄ是話筒電池，從四個半伏脫到六伏脫。</p>
<p>上面另件可以說，在收音機中都可找到，不過話筒和一萬歐姆的固定電阻R，是需要買的。電唱頭在本刋已經發表過用聽筒自製的方法，讀者亦可依法仿造。至於接線和排列等，和收音機的裝法一様。RFC不宜放進L的磁塲裏去，最好能遠離或成直角。</p>
<p>L的製法如下：用四英寸長二英寸半直徑膠管，兩端各空半時，用十八號綫繞三十圈（每時繞十圈，）用滑鍵衣滑桿調節，滑桿通A十（圖中K）波長約自一百五十到二百公尺。</p>
<p>裝成後，可用一隻適於一百五十到二百公尺的收音機在旁收聽，以校正自已的波長，不過要注意的的，就是不要闖到廣播範四裏去，同時爲小心起見，還是向交通部備案爲妥，我想業餘試騐，當局也不見得不准吧？</p>
<p>至於調凖的方法，本刋絡續載着羅靜予先生的「短波發射機之調凖法及其步驟」讀者可以細閱。</p>
<h3>再談電源電壓不穩定之補救方法</h3>
<p>— 魏心蘇</p>
<p>電力供給電壓之不穩定·其對於收音機之危害，實甚重大，非可忽視。電壓過量，固將促短眞空管及整流器慮波器之壽命，且甚至有燒毁之危險，但電壓不足，亦非僅減弱音量與消失選擇性而已，實同様能損害與空管，蓋燈絲温度過低，則常發生電弧也。</p>
<p>本刋前一期作者曾引用降壓方棚與收音機電力方棚串聯以調整電壓。其方法雖簡單而且經濟，但須入手時時校凖，不適於一般使用收音機者之需要，故另舉兩種自動電壓調整器放下。</p>
<p>市上有所謂電壓調整器者（VoltageRegulator），係一種能變耗阻絲所製成，置於有孔之金屬圓筒中，如遇過高電壓，則其耗阻量隨温度而增高，如遇正常或低落電壓，則其耗阻量甚低。此種調整器雖可抑制過量電壓，但於電壓低落則無能爲力。今依圖一之法，如某地電壓最低爲Ioov.，則可用一輸入IIoV,輸出Ｉ1V.之電鈴方棚與之串聯，使此Ｉ2V.加於IooV.而提高電壓至II2V.，經過調整器則可得IIoV.矣。此種裝置雖電源電壓回復正常或過量，均能自動調整，蓋電壓增高則其耗阻亦隨之增高而使供給放收音機之電壓常近IIoV.也。上述所用之電鈴方棚，須注意基安培量不得少於收音機所需之安培。</p>
<h3>圖一　圖二</h3>
<p>電壓補救器（Ｖoltage　Compensator）爲一種特别設計之昇壓自變壓器如圖二所示，當電壓低落時此昇壓變壓器能使電壓昇高而回復至正常電壓．　　圖中之Ｃ部份在稍低於鐵心透磁性飽和膝之處發生作用。如電壓過量，則鐵心之Ｃ部份飽和亦隨之而增高，於是强近一部份磁力線由空隙而通過Ｄ部份，因此使Ｂ線圈發生相反電極而與過乘之電壓相消除。　　此圖電壓補救器在上海店舗中能否買到，作者不大清楚，在美國則有Sola　Corp.出品，其輸入電壓自95V.到Ｉ３５V.,能供一百華特之電力。</p>
<h3>鎢錏管充電器的製法</h3>
<p>— 一知</p>
<p>有蓄電池的朋友，都會感到把笨重的蓄電池搬到電料店家充電，旣麻煩而又耗錢：誰不想自己有了一具充電器，祇把撲落挿入電燈線上，充電器上的隂陽二極的線一接，讓牠充足了電後，一拆就好，多麽便利呢！然購一具充電器，非五六十元不能：一時拿出這惹大的費用，有的恐爲經濟限止，有的恐不捨得，所以没法自己充電，祗得每月把電池搬來搬去受苦，鄙人亦是其中受苦的一位，每到欲去充電時常懷怨望，因此决心自製一具充電器，經過了十數天的功夫，將一具鎢錏管充電器製好了，總共費了廿餘元錢，成績還算不錯，倘與外貨相比，交用一様，金錢却省去了一半多，値今提倡國貨經濟救國的時候，少省一筆錢，送給外國人用：且自己做了後，又得着一次經騐，損壞了自己會能修理，不是一件很合算値得做的事嗎？我想歡喜弄無線朋友，想製這充電器者，一定不少，所以把製造法來介紹（因爲篇幅關係，不能詳細說明，祗能擇其要者以述：如有疑問之處，請投函本刋轉交鄙人，以便指示及共同研究。）</p>
<p>這鎢錏管充電器（Ｔungar　Charger）所需村料列下：</p>
<p>鎢錏管（Ｔungar　Tube）　一只</p>
<p>IIOV40W碳絲燈炮（Carbon　Iamp）　一只</p>
<p>變壓器（Transformer）一只（自制或改造）</p>
<p>安培表（Ammeter）　一只</p>
<p>電阻器（Ｒesisfor）　一只</p>
<p>螺絲燈座　二只</p>
<p>挿塞及挿口　三對</p>
<p>十七號雙紗包線　二磅餘</p>
<p>十六號雙紗包線　八十呎</p>
<p>洋銀線（German　Silver　Wire）三十呎等。</p>
<p>上列物件除鎢錏管，碳絲燈炮，及電流表不能自製外，餘可買來配製。</p>
<p>鎢錏管在市面上通用的爲美國奇異鹟中出品，牠的優點有二：（一）經用，（二）效率佳，種類視電流容量大小而定、分：（一）二安培的（二）六安培的，現在我們買一種二安培的已夠用，這二安培的鎢錏形式如圖一</p>
<p>圖一</p>
<p>這管内有水銀似的物質塗着，下部微有透明，可以窺見絲極與屏極，絲極用鎢絲製的，屏極用碳精制的，買來的時候，絲極微有光彩；屏極表面則非常光滑，一無黑點。</p>
<p>電流表（安培表）倘若自己已有弗安兩用表，或千分安培表加分線（Shunt）都可以用，不必購買。</p>
<p>變壓器倘若用在交流機上有六七十瓦特電力的，即可利用，祗將線圈拆繞即成，倘处自製一具，則買４Ｉ／２"ＸＩＩ／２"的矽鋼片約四磅餘，鐵片預備好，再製二只套在鐵片上的繞線架即可開始繞線了。（未完）</p>
<h3>聆餘漫談（四）</h3>
<p>— 微言</p>
<p>丨國内播音界之現狀丨</p>
<p>ＸＨＨＨ中西大藥房附設的廣播電臺，素以節目高尚見稱，學術節目之多，不亞於其他任何電臺。近來增加早操及電影介紹等節目，尤見提倡體育及宣揚文化之主旨。不過該臺廣各之多，實足使人聽了生厭。平均每奏半面唱片，便有幾段很長的廣告。有時興之所至，一面播送唱片，一面還將廣告和在裏面。使人聽了頭昏腦脹，不知所從。假如逢到特别節目時，那就一來十多則，使人嘆爲聽止。我並不反對各電臺在節目内　入廣告，不過宣傳廣告，也要有適當的份量，過多了聽衆便要另收他家。這様，廣告效力，便等於零。我以爲最好在一段節目告終後，下一次節目還未開始報告前，加入一些廣告。一次數不妨增多。時間却忌冗長。辭句尤須簡潔，不可重複。庆様，聽衆正在渴望着下一次的節目，一時是决不會旋掉的。（華美，亞東等電臺，每唱一張唱片挿入一段很短的廣告，我們爲最是得法。）</p>
<p>ＸＭＨＡ上海西人設立的播音臺，也有四五家之多，並且電力都是很大的。其中以華美西人廣播電臺，每日上午七時至十二時三十分長時間的西樂，最爲聽衆所歡迎。據說，他們的播音機音調的高低，是可以隨時控制的，所以發出去聲浪十分悅耳動聽。</p>
<h3>常識</h3>
<p>— 黃鑑村</p>
<p>（十八）眞空管概說（二）</p>
<p>（Ｃ）（Ｂ）</p>
<p>四極眞空管：四極眞空管之所以異於三極眞空管者，乃在於前者更多一棚極，即由一屏極，一燈絲與二棚極而成。如上圖所示，（a）爲四極管之題用符號，圖中接近於燈絲者稱内部棚極，接近於屏極，接近於屏極者稱外部棚極。此内外兩棚極又因用途之不同，而使四極管分成簾棚極管（Screen　grid　tube）與空間電子棚極管（Space　charge　grid　tube）之兩種。（b）圖表示空間電子棚極管之構造及其連接法，圖中Ｆ爲燈絲，SCG爲空間電子棚極，CG爲控制棚極，P爲屏極。空間電子棚極接有正電壓，其功用爲抵消空間電子之負性電塲，以低减屏電壓。原來在眞空管内散佈有由燈絲所放射之電子，此等電子在管内自成一負性電塲，是爲空間電子之負性電塲。在三極管内因有負性電塲之存在，故非使屏電壓增大則不能運用，然在四極管另有抵消此負性電塲之裝置，自可低减屏電壓，以增其效用。（c）圖所示者爲簾棚極管之構造及其連接法，其外部棚極用爲簾棚極ＳＧ，其所不同於（b）圖者祗在於此點。簾棚極之功用除可抵消空間電子負性電塲外，更可低减管内之内部電容量，以屏除其自行振盪之弊。四極管之所以特適用于高週率放大器者，其故乃在於此。四極管雖有上述兩類，然因簾棚極管之功用較優，故今日使用簾棚極管乃較多，而空間電子棚極管則幾在被淘汰之列。</p>

<h3>「商定」文豪</h3>
<p>— 白在宣</p>
<p>筆頭也是尖的，也要鑽。别的地方鑽不進，只好對於文藝雜誌告白誇大，前去刺一下。</p>
<p>一看雜誌的告白，作者就個個是文豪，中國文壇也眞好像光燄萬大，可最</p>
<p>面也招來了鼻孔裏的哼哼聲。然而。著作一世，藏之名山，以待考古團的掘出的作家，此刻早已没有了，連自作自刻，訂成薄薄的一本，分送朋友的詩人，也已經不大遇得到。現在是前週作稿，次週登報，上月剪貼，下月出書，大抵僅僅爲稿費，倘說，作者是餓着肚子，專心在爲社會服務，恐怕說出來有點要臉紅罷，就是笑人需要稿費的高士，他那一篇嘲笑的文章也還是不免要稿費。但自然，另有薪水，或者能靠女人奩賣養活的文豪，都不屬於這一類。</p>
<p>就大體而言，根子是在賣錢，所以上海的各式各様的文豪，由於『商定』，是『久已夫，已非一日矣』的了。</p>
<p>商家印好一種稿子後，倘那時封建得勢，廣告上就說作者是封建文豪，革命行時，便是革命文豪，於是封定了一批文豪們。别家的書也印出來了，另一種廣锆地說些作者並非眞封建或眞革命文豪，這邊的才是眞貨色，於是又封定了一批文豪們。别一家又集印了各種廣告的論戰。一位作者加上些批評，另出了一位新文豪</p>
<p>還有一法是結合一套脚色，要幾個詩人，幾個小說家，一個批評家，商量一下，立一個什麽社，登起廣告來，打倒被文豪，抬出新文豪，結果也總可以封定一批文豪們，也是一種的『商定』。</p>
<p>就大體而言，根子是　賣錢，所以後來的書價，就不免指出文豪們的眞價値，照價二斤，五角一堆，也說不定的。不過有一種例外：離然鋪子出盤，作品賤賣，却非文豪們走了末路，那是他們已經『爬了上去』，進大學，進衙門，不要這踏脚櫈了。</p>
<h3>美國人目中的中國</h3>
<p>— 姚克</p>
<p>近年以來，美國出版界中關於中國的書報的銷數，頗有突飛猛進之勢賽珍珠的大地，不必說，早已是「不踎踁而走」，博到了世界的聲譽。只就今年出版的書而論，其中關於中國的也就多不勝讀。據我個人所見的，有二本很値得我們的注意，並且可以因此一道，「美國人目中的中國」是怎麽一回事。</p>
<p>一本是今年九月間出版的遠東的前線（Ｆar　Eastern　Front）。著者Edgar　Snow是一個美國通訊社的遠東記者。在這三三六頁的書中，他把整個的遠東情勢赤裸裸地暴露出來了。「侵略國」軍閥併吞東北的隂謀，東三省失陷的經過，「不抵抗」的内幕，淞滬之戰和僞國成立的素描，熱河淪陷和塘沽恊定的意義丨丨都像電影一般，活躍地在這書中開演着。其觀察之精微和周密，描寫手腕之生動和正確，立論態度之公正和透闢，實在可以使我們驚異。但其中最最使我感動的是關於中國民衆和政治現狀的幾章，和將來遠東情勢的推論。著者在三二六頁上說：『在多年的時期中，名義，政府，計畫，都有變更，但臺上演的仍是那麽一齣戲。種種不良的成分和性質，似乎永無盡期的繼續存在丨丨缺乏意義，團結，和科學的作用。』這就是美國人目中的中國丨雖然很使人掃興，但我們却也尋不出什麽可以推翻這種話的證據。事實勝於雄辯；我們即使辯，也不過是「脫了褲子遮臉」，越遮越出醜罷了。</p>
<p>還有許多更剴切痛切的話，本來想譯出幾句，因無空閒工夫，只能讓讀者自己去找原書看罷。</p>
<p>另一本書是女作家Nora　Waln寫的小說寄廬（The　House　of　Ezile）。這本書是今年四月出版的，在三個月中竟再版了八次之多，據說是今年美國銷路最好的小說了。但書中的故事却非但平凡而且枯燥，其中荒謬的地方更不勝縷舉。例如：在十一月出嫁的女子到明年二月已生了兒子，而故事中並無她與未婚夫「先行交易」的叙述或可能情形；十九軍約蔡廷楷變成了名聞全國的「富於幻想的青年詩人」（Ａ　dreany　youn　poet）;一個六代同堂的中國家庭，其家譜竟能追溯到一百三十九代以上。我們山東的「衍聖公」也不過是孔子第七十七代的孫子丨這種荒謬的地方，我們都可以付之一笑。但其中有許多關於政治和社會的謬論，却是情不容絮的。例如：她說中國在一九三一年春已經開始處烈抵制日貨，但實際上直到七月二日萬寳山事件之後，才有抵貨運動，至於描寫中國生活，更是不倫不類，給美國讀者一種極謬誤的印象。</p>
<p>最惱人的是著者自已的立塲。她這本書，雖然名爲小說，其實是用「目覩者」自傳的口吻寫的。没有到過中國來的美國讀者很容易以爲眞，這是在我們意料之中的，何况更有賽珍珠讚道，『這本書的眞實性是没有問題的。』這又是一本使人不快意的書。</p>
<p>以上兩本書給我兩種不同的不快意。第一種是丨王爾德曾說過的丨『客立本（Caliban）在鏡中看見自己的眞面目』的不快意，第二種是『客立本在镜中看不見自己眞面目』的不快意。遠東的前線，在我所見的關於中日糾紛和中國現狀的書中，其觀察可謂最忠實，最尖銳，其立論最爲精闢而公正，但未免敎我們照見了自己的醜態。在我不過是有些不快意而已，但闊人們看了也許會（？）哭笑不得的。至於寄廬這本書，除非我們要找些笑料，不看也罷；不過我以爲中國筆會不妨寄些言論到美國，糾正這種謬誤的印象，免得將來閙出美國詩翁來請蔡廷楷聯詩句的笑話。</p>
<h3>村民</h3>
<p>— 程雲萍</p>
<p>大家的心裏都懷疑·而且有點慌張。村裏來了個募化的和尙·本不是奇事。但是這兵慌馬亂的年頭，只要一點和平常異様的事，就像半夜裏有什麽人高喊了幾聲，也會使村民都從床上跳了起來，赤着脚向門外跑。來了個和尙，人心裏都一致疑他是偵探之類，是土匪派來楨探這裏有没有駐軍的。和尙是三十歳左右的壯年人，大家都說如果不是土匪派來的，如何身體這船强壯？他在路上一面敲着木魚，一面眼睛還不住的東張西望，這更是心裏懷着鬼胎的證據。　　和尙是住在村頭關帝廟裏。於是有大夥子的人同去查究。</p>
<p>月光不大明亮，風在草上颼颼的響。大夥子的人在路上低聲議論首。有的主張把他促住明兒送到城裏去，有的主張今夜庨奆就　，我們村子。大家都躡手躡脚的　。因爲好不給他知道。可以看看他在那兒幹什麽。</p>
<p>從門縫裏窺進去，和尙是出乎意料的很寗靜地打着團在唸經。於是，大家一窩蜂様湧進去了。和尙很客氣的向大家招呼。</p>
<p>「師父是那兒來的？」打頭的人開口就問。</p>
<p>「湖南ＸＸ山，各位來有什麽貴幹？」和尙回答得十分恭和。</p>
<p>「請你離開我們這裏！」</p>
<p>「這年頭是不好給異鄉人住的！」大家於是跟着嚷。</p>
<p>和尙要求明一早走。然而大家不允許。大家搶着呌。搶着嚷。和尙無可奈何地收拾行李，就在夜裏走了。但大家仍在疑心，怕他今晚說不定還要來，而且會有什麽事變。但小的連睡也不寗貼。疑慮着，慌張着，直得天亮。</p>
<h3>人間</h3>
<p>— 廖伯坦</p>
<p>走倦了，好渴！汗啦！汗在滾滾地流着。</p>
<p>帽子在滴水了。這要命的炎夏！</p>
<p>我在ＸＸ公園歇下了。</p>
<p>挑担子的哼哼地；樹木懶懶的垂着頭……</p>
<p>世界都好像是疲乏了！然而他們不得不呌着，哼着。</p>
<p>蒼蠅，蜜蜂，「呌笛子」，這裏一飛，那裏一鑽，眞夠忙。</p>
<p>外面時時傳來了算命的瞎子鐺鐺的聲音，慢慢地，頗帶點靜意。</p>
<p>打那面，走來了一個折了腿，傷了手的灰色朋友，坐在我身邊。</p>
<p>，紙白而透灰黑色；一隻手綳帶吊着；脚是一根木棍代替了。</p>
<p>站在世界的另一個邊緣了，這可憐的人！我想。</p>
<p>「唉！」他抽了一口氣；眼睛低垂着，懶懶的；轉刻，又仲起那儘剩一憎皮的臉，望望天；隨即，又低下去了。</p>
<p>這他是人？</p>
<p>丨總還有一個骸骨在這裏，紀忠塔下才骸骨也不見啦！誰在說着，我可不曉得。</p>
<p>我斜眼望他，他在流淚。</p>
<p>他在流淚，我也流淚，爲什什麽？</p>
<p>再仔細看時，一張五六十歳的老婦人的照片在他手裏打轉！</p>
<h3>兩兄弟（二十五）</h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑著李維克譯</p>
<p>隨後他又忽在坐下。她並不使他喜歡，這女人！爲什麽緣故呢？她本當於那種平凡且卑下的思慮了；並且還有一層，她不是像比較的喜歡哲安嗎？這事他自己雖然没有明白承認，但他把這寡婦看得不很聰明的原因大部份却是因爲她比較中意哲安的緣故，因爲他雖喜歡他的弟弟，可是他總以爲他有點平庸，而自己却比較優越。</p>
<p>無論如何他總不能在這地方坐到晚的；於是像昨天晚上一様，他焦急地尋思着：「我怎麽辦呢？」</p>
<p>他現在覺到自己心裏需要感動，需要有人來抱吻他，來安慰他。他究竟有什麽事需要安慰呢？他自己也莫明其紗，不過他現在正感着懦弱和疲倦，在這時候，一個女人的出現，一個女的撫慰，一隻纖手的接觸，一件女人的衣裳的摩擦，一個黑的或藍的温柔的眼色，似乎是我們心理所迫切要求的，必不可少的。</p>
<p>他這時記起了曾把他帶去家裏睡了一晚以後還時常看見的一個啤酒店裏的小待女。</p>
<p>他於是重又站起身來，預備去和這女孩子喝一杯啤酒。他要和她說些什麽呢？他會和他說些什麽呢？無疑的什麽都没有。但這有什麽相干呢？他可以把她的手握一會兒。她好像還喜歡他的様子。爲什麽他没有比較勤一點去看她呢？</p>
<p>他的時起，她正在那幾乎空虛着的碑酒店的廳堂，坐在一把椅子上打磕睡。本個酒客把手臂支在橡樹做的桌子上抽着烟斗，管賬的女人念着一本小說，而酒店主人則單穿着襯衫在木橙上熟睡着。</p>
<p>這女孩子一看見他，便連忙立起身來走到他面前說：</p>
<p>「早安，你好嗎？」</p>
<p>「還不壞，你呢？」</p>
<p>「我嗎，好極了。你來得眞少呀？」</p>
<p>「是啦，我簡直不得空。你曉得我是醫生呢」。</p>
<p>「嚇，這事你從前没有告訴過我。如果我知道你是醫生，我上星期生病時，一定請你看了。你要喝什麽呢？」</p>
<p>「一杯啤酒，你泥？」</p>
<p>「我嗎，也喝一杯啤酒，横豎你給我付賬。」</p>
<p>她繼續用一種親暱的稱呼和他談話，好像他請她喝了一杯啤酒就不言而喻地給了她這項權利似的。於是兩人面對面坐下閒談着。她不時的以一種賣笑女人容易有的狎呢的様子拉着他的手，並以一種逗人喜歡的眼色瞧着他，對他說：</p>
<p>「你爲什麽不來得勤一點呢？親愛的，我狠喜歡你呢。」</p>
<p>可是他已經討厭她起來了，覺得她愚蠢，平凡，有着下流氣味。他想：女人應當在夢中或是在可以詩化她們的庸俗之處的一種華貴的氣氛裏出現才行。</p>
<p>她問他道：</p>
<p>「你有一天早上曾和一個長着金黃頭髮並有着滿嘴鬍鬚的美男子走過，那是你是弟弟嗎？」</p>
<p>「是啦，那是我的弟弟。」</p>

<h3>南北貨　龍口粉低廉逾恒</h3>
<p>龍口線粉干　近以新貨盛出、地價步跌、以致申市開價特廉、迭現新低價、爲歷年以來所僅見、且現在銷路尙未暢旺、暫無漲望、昨市行售頭牌龍口粉呌售十七元半、比上月間降去二元許、</p>
<h3>五金　美馬口鐵走廣銷旺</h3>
<p>美馬口鐵、近來交易異常興奮、客帮廠家走銷繁旺、故數日中已開出二千六七百箱之多、其價九十磅每箱開十六元五角、一百磅十七元五角而雙連貨則九十磅開三十三元七角半、一百磅三十七元、聞連日蛋廠帮印花廠等點綴頗夥、以上各貨因各帮走廣銷緊、市上現貨頗有不繼之概、緣是行情方面、殊甚樂觀、</p>

<h3>油市　白桐油新貨俏疲不同</h3>
<p>▲漢油報漲…浙省反疲▲</p>
<p>白桐油自漢口洋莊交易沉寂後、市面卽見萎靡、上週漢行售洋行已跌至每担二十四元七角、數祗數十噸、乃至上星期六、似有活動趨勢、而漢行開進襄桐亦稍加增、已做二十元○三角至二十元○六角客規、至昨晚漢電傳來、洋莊已售開二十五元六角、與上週已漲起一元、市面雖屬出於尋常、惟時適新貨將到未到之際、突起變端、則陳油存積之薄、已可概見、乃據湘鄂川等省桐子年令、今庚祗及上年之半、故年令歉收、確是實情、且價格已抵、産地人心較爲堅固、雖市面之關鍵仍須視洋莊之有無及多寡、然易漲難跌、當可預定也、浙省爲本埠之近鄰、交通利便、朝發夕至、而杭垣新貨上週業已見様、連接有到、日見其多、惟所到係解前售抛盤者居多、故現售極少、而市情反見疲弱、斯乃將與新油　接之徵象、現油自每砠二十三元現已跌二十二元矣、昨悉杭行開進上江榨坊家卽須解貨數百担、價格每砠二十二元、訂定隂歷本月内解齊、又二十一元五六角、係出月初十前解齊、均西箱砠江交、聞産地桐子價格尙廉、成本或可在二十元之内、據昨晚最後消息、杭行進至二十元○八角、解期稍遲、再有十九元四角、則更延長矣、抛盤期貨愈售愈廉、則後去市面、不言可喻、但價格已至最低、縱跌亦已有限、本埠號家所進新油抛貨、數有千餘担、而解期未屆、故近日少見交易、雖漢口洋莊稍見俏勢、而浙桐依然少神、敬能藉北音而得中流砥　、不致再往下游、則市面已有立足之點、南北亦得漸趨於一途矣、</p>
<h3>絲茶　英倫茶市突起變化</h3>
<p>英倫爲紅茶銷售之一極大市塲、年來因印度錫商紅花、生産過剩、茶價步跌、茶農茶商、交受其困、法英荷茶商數次限制産量之結果、至今春存底始告肅清、印錫茶價、亦復逐步高漲、我國兩湖紅茶、因售價較印錫茶低廉、銷路大爲活潑、統計本年輸入英國之數、不下八萬餘箱、祁寗紅茶</p>
<p>行家所得消息、突起變化、印錫茶價大跌、華茶除高莊祁門貨、無甚影響外、其餘亦均囤積不動、其原因實由於日俄關係惡化、印度爪哇茶對俄貿易完全停滯所致、</p>

<h3>「海裏撈月」</h3>
<p>— 之</p>
<p>向海裏去撈月，這是把身子沉到海底，也是撈摸不着的事情。因爲，月出産在天上，而海裏只不過是它的一個幻渺空虛的影兒而已。想想看。幻渺空虛的影兒，也能抓得住的麽？除非那眞是痴子啊！</p>
<p>雖然，但人總是喜歡幹這幻渺空虛的海裏撈月的勾當丨丨愈是幻渺空虛不可期，愈喜歡幹，而且愈幹得瘋狂，普遍！以前，只聽說過有好些詩人文士在月明星稀的靜夜，駕了一葉扁舟，到湖面上去對月（月裏的月哪）把酒吟詩做賦。據說這是最文雅不過的事情，但實際上，最多不過是屬於風子，無聊之類的玩意兒。雖然，他們還只不過在嘴巴裏哼哼，表示欣賞讚美這幻渺空虛的水裏的月，究竟他們還没有動手脫了襪子捲起褲脚下水去撈摸，所以他們倒底還是屬於「文」之一流的。</p>
<p>可是，「水裏的月」一到非文人的手裏，或是出現在非文人的面前，那是不會輕易放過它的。他們總得自動的或是被動的運用他們簡單的得可笑的腦經，千方面計想出不成方法的可法來，就是脫得赤身露體，甚至剥皮抽筋，也甘心情願地下水去撈摸的。但是結果呢。他們究竟撈得了幾何甚麽東西呢？幻渺，空虛，詛咒，沮喪，以及身赤，體露，皮剥，筋抽等等之外，還會再有稍些實際意義的其他麽？</p>
<p>今日的一切市塲上，盤據着許許多多的聰明的慣會捉弄人而自己便在其中取巧謀利的先生們，他們在暗地裏高高的懸起一個耀人眼睛或是刺激人的心肝的鏡子様的東西，發出兇猛可佈的强光來，照射到河海，使河海裏也反映出一個幻渺空虛的類似有兒的影子來。一班呆頭呆腦的瘋子白痴之類　傢伙，便會丢了自己現有的衣和襪，忍着皮和筋的疼，縱身跳海去撈摸。就在瘋子白痴之類的呆漢們在水裏摸來撈去的時候，暗地裏在岸上弄玄虛的總明的先生們，便收拾他　的法　，捲了瘋子白痴之類的衣，襪，並帶了他們的皮，筋，到他們自己温暖的室裏，縱笑取樂去了！這時候，海裏的呆漢們，有的覺悟了這是不可期的幻渺和空虛，便毅希爬上岸來，赤身露體的帶了滿身的傷痕回家去重新做衣，襪，休息，養傷的事；有的仍然伏在水裏養精蓄銳地期待着，其待下</p>
<p>一次月兒的出現好再來撈摸，就是一直等到把自己整個兒撈摸得幻滅了，他還是不肯罷休的，他說：「做了鬼也要撈摸此月」。</p>
<p>有人說：瘋子白痴之類的傢伙居然肯舍了一切的下海去撈這不可期的幻渺空虛的月，固然可見其愚，呆，笨，反常了丨但他究竟還是有　覺的，當他望着海裏的月的時候，偶然的，他必定也會擡起頭來看見天上的眞實的月，這時，不過只是因爲天上的月距他太遠了些，要取得是太費力太困難了，而就在他眼前的海面上的月，他不知是虛的，他以爲好像是不必勞神便可順手取得一様的，於是他才捨遠就近，過輕避重地幹出呆頭呆腦，結果毁滅整個自己的事情來丨所以，他們的動機，還是懶惰，貪心，無賴！……</p>
<p>的，但。　　我們是必需的，我們總得要實際去取得來。然而要實際　取得，是必然要粉碎一切製造不可期的幻渺空虛的假月的鏡子法寳之類，以及種種的烟幕，我們將縱身下海的勇氣和决心運用來取距離我們遠些的，必須經過費力和困難而後才能到手的天上的眞實的月！</p>
<p>眞要月兒的，天上去取丨</p>
<h3>僕人</h3>
<p>— 列火</p>
<p>現在人類中，最可憐的是僕人，最可恨的也是僕人，這是他們的特殊環境造成的，苛責他們的本身，似乎是不應該，這兒我就是想拿他們的特殊環境來作一番檢討。</p>
<p>誰都知道，十個僕人足有兩組五個是無産階級，這様，在人類生活的憑藉上，他們就只有，也只配排定在危殆的起碼的陣線上·事實上有不少的樸人是過着極低劣的生活，彷佛與沿門巡行的乞卒差不多，而在精神上，靈魂上，則過要緊縮不少。</p>
<p>然而究竟說來，却並非如此，他們是很有機會跟搭富人，他們是很有希望與很有生氣的一羣，這不必考證史乘，只要翻翻成話，近百年來「可資垂典」的常有人拿做學校裏的「公民」一課的敎材的成功人物，就常有這種僕人的驚人表率。比如說：「某人出身貧寒，而立年華，始隨某豪富西人，充當差遣，以忠實勤謹，見重於主，嗣即信用日增，地位日高，座乃自立門，聲譽驟隆，成功當時偉人之一。」</p>
<p>於此可知，僕人之能跟搭上富人，能有希望與夫能有生氣，均要借賴於忠實勤謹，忠實勤謹就是僕人高陞的唯一丹方，所以邏輯起來，便是凡忠實勤謹的撲人，都有希望，都有生氣。就拿眼前的事實來說，忠實勤謹的僕人，無不獲得主人的歡心，只要如此，主人有什麽詭計秘密，都不會瞞你，有些事甚至要仗你出面。出門去。险了牽帶碩大的雄犬衛護以外，還必要僕人二三位站立跟前，以壯胆量。</p>
<p>所以，還一多，從僕人的現　上　，他們的物質享受，也必然很有生氣，不消說普通的聽差娘夷等等，穿著吃喝，大多有些像小老婆大少爺，肉體都是白嫩而滾壯的。最是娘姨抱了小天使，獨自坐一部汽車在馬路上兜風，我們常時碰到過。聽差隨着富翁要人同坐花車以增色京滬的「冠蓋往來」的，自然也不在少數。然則，其生活之舒適，自亦可以意像得之矣。</p>
<p>僕人的生活，就如此其有生氣，如此其有保障！爲的就是他們跟搭得富翁要人。</p>
<p>更有除了正主子的見重與正主子所賞賜的享受以外，還往往有着開旁飛來的見重與賞賜，比如小姐瞞着太太與野男子通信遣情，甚至偷着外出幽會，這於娘姨之輩十九有好處，只要忠實些，可靠些，小姐是非常信賴的，有許多的大事都會遣使你，比如暗遞情書，半夜裏輕步的起來開後門。以此小姐也就會特别關照你，除了在你面前擺幅好臉孔，好感情，除了送很多半新不舊的衣裳絲襪給你，除了有小賬給你，還會爲你在太太爹爹前代替進言增加工錢。同様，少爺與聽差車夫也有這麽許多的牽搭，如偷懶上學，需要娘姨們帮嘴鬆肩，報答亦復不輕。</p>
<p>在這各種的情形下，這輩僕人對一搫的人就很傲氣不凡，甚至作福作威，與虎爲倀，所以現在有許多人說，這世界太不成様兒了，硬要改革，僕人聽了，就不大以爲然，這就正因爲他們有上述的各種關係，他們是緊靠着「麻醉器」的。所以他們不但非常不相信，而且還能出生有力的反動，張牙怒爪，其凶無比。迨到他們一旦「亨通」，其致力於下焉　的壓迫，剥削，也就要更深更厲害一層。僕人就少了一些靈魂與覺悟。</p>
<p>所以，　在人類　，最可憐的是僕人，最可恨的也是僕人。</p>

<h3>女人</h3>
<p>— 敬嘉</p>
<p>『我需要一個女人。』平在他給我底信中告訴我：『我太孤獨了，我孤獨得』</p>
<p>像一座在沙漠中的石像。没有安慰我，使我快樂。我需要一個女人了！没有女人，空虛會吞滅了我。』</p>
<p>讀完了信，我覺得很可笑。我記起了他那不匀的身段，蓬亂的頭髮，平坦的鼻子，闊大的嘴吧，和那付滿佈着雀斑的臉。</p>
<p>平是ＸＸ公司的書記。那公司離我家並不遠。我打了一個電話給他，我說：『我希望你能來我家談談。』</p>
<p>那天晚上，兩點没重地打在地上。是初夏的天氣。悶得很。曉是那様大的雨，也帶不走悶熱。</p>
<p>我獨自坐着看予盾的路。我聽見門響。抬起頭，我瞧見一隻水淋鷄，那就是可憐的平。</p>
<p>『你需要女人嗎？』我劈頭就這様問。</p>
<p>『怎様？我不該有嗎？』</p>
<p>『你很該有哩！』我道：『你大了，而且有了職業。不像我一輩子在書裏和課堂中磨日子。』</p>
<p>『我想我該有一個了！』平燃了支烟捲：『你眞不知道我多末孤獨哩！』</p>
<p>靜默了一下，平說：『我見了那些一對對的摟着腰在路上走的就恨：不，不是恨，那是嫉妒，我可爲。我見了女子就會臉上紅，流汗。可是這次我應該鼓些勇氣了！』</p>
<p>『我相信你現一定有了對象。』</p>
<p>『不，』他說：『我没有。』</p>
<p>『你不老實，你的眼睛已經告訴我了！』</p>
<p>『眞的？你眞是賊眼丨』平把烟吐到我的面前：『哈，我眞的有了呢！』</p>
<p>『是不是！』我忍着笑，繼續說：『你的艷福眞好啊！能告訴我更詳細一些的嗎？』</p>
<p>『他是我的同學！』平說。</p>
<p>『上過電影院嗎，你倆？』</p>
<p>『上電影院！好輕鬆！百家姓還没開簿面哩！』</p>
<p>『難道她不愛你？』</p>
<p>『我不知道，我只知道我愛她！』</p>
<p>『哈哈！』我笑道：『多滑稽的一回事哪！』</p>
<p>『怎麽？我不能愛她嗎？』平有些貧怒了！</p>
<p>『那裏！你别誤會。你想怎様呢？』他搔了搔頭髮，將烟蒂頭抛進痰盂　。『我一定要進攻。她的確美得動人啊！我没時没刻不想着她。』</p>
<p>於是我問道：『你想怎様進攻呢？』</p>
<p>他燃着了第二支烟捲，靜默了一下，他說：『我想寫信，你瞧好不好。』</p>
<p>『當然囉！』我說：『寫信是很好的，但是很難寫得動人。』</p>
<p>『不妨，我盡我的力量寫就成。』</p>
<p>『我預祝你勝利！』</p>
<p>平不響，躺在椅子上，仰着頭，青烟一圈圈地從他的口中噴出，一點點地消失了！</p>
<p>我移了一移我的椅子，我用手摸撫他的亂髮：『你先該在頭髮上塗塗油，面上也該敷層粉。』</p>
<p>平笑了一笑，說：『那到是眞的。』</p>
<p>於是我黃氏聲地說：『可能把那位密司的名字告訴我？』</p>
<p>『這不能！』</p>
<p>『横竪將來總要告訴我的。』我說：現在不是一様嗎？』</p>
<p>『她姓尹。』平說。</p>
<p>『姓尹？』我驚異的一呼。『名字呢？』</p>
<p>『麗霞。』</p>
<p>『尹麗霞，尹麗霞！哈哈！』我狂笑了！</p>
<p>『嘿，有什麽好笑的！』</p>
<p>『哈！』我竭力忍住了笑。『這眞是一個美麗的名字哪！』</p>
<p>『這眞是滑稽的事哩！』我想。</p>
<p>過了一會，平動身告辭，臨别，也堅决地說：『今天晚上，我就得開始我的工作。』</p>
<p>平去了之後，我躺在床上靜靜地想了半個鐘頭。於是我决定向我的計劃進行。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>一星期後，平寫信報告他的成績；『我已經得到她的回信了。她很有文學的天才。那眞是動人的情書哪！我幾乎疑心我在做夢。』</p>
<p>我用紅紙寫了一行字給他，我說：『敬祝勝利，預定喜筵一席。』</p>
<p>三天後，平打了個電話給我，他說：『明天要上ＸＸ大戲院。』</p>
<p>『她呢？』我問。</p>
<p>『當然同去。』</p>
<p>『我呢？』</p>
<p>『恕不招待』</p>
<p>『那不行。』</p>
<p>『不便的。』</p>
<p>『我不管。』</p>
<p>『對不起，别搗蛋。』</p>
<p>『你能禁止我看戲嗎？』</p>
<p>『好，你自己去。我不管。』</p>
<p>電話斷了，我笑得打跌。</p>
<p>第二天下午。我到了ＸＸ大戲院。時間已經不早，樓下已經坐得滿的！我上了樓，在右邊那角中我打着了平。我看見他穿着一身很挺直的西裝，頭上也抹着一層油，臉上的雀斑也被雪花粉等遮没了一部分。從我認識他到現到，我是第一次看見他這様的整齊。</p>
<p>他見了我，忸泥得很。和我打了一個招呼。</p>
<p>我走到他的坐的那一排上。坐在他旁邊的那位平所愛慕的女士站起未向我點點頭，她說：『你才來啊！』</p>
<p>我笑着說：『我以爲還太早哩！』</p>
<p>平驚異的說：『你認識尹女士嗎？』</p>
<p>我輕輕的坐在他旁邊的那只空位上，我輕輕地摸了一摸平的頭髮，我眼睛瞧在樓板上，我低微的說：『她是我的未婚妻。』</p>

        <h1>1933.11.11</h1>
<h3>Okamura Arrives in Tianjin and Conferred with Yu Xuezhong; Agreement in Principle Reached on Returning All Passes Along the Great Wall, Starting with Shanhaiguan, Followed by Other Passes Westward, Large and Small, and on Opening Traffic, Postal Services, and Establishing Customs Posts; Specific Implementation Methods Still Require Further Negotiation Between Both Parties</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Yin Tong accompanied Okamura to visit Yu Xuezhong at his residence at 1:00 PM on the 10th. Okamura expressed that all passes along the Great Wall could be returned, starting with Shanhaiguan, followed by other passes westward, both large and small. Other issues, such as customs duties, postal services, and traffic, are also easy to resolve. It is decided that Okamura will return to Beiping on the 11th and then fly back to Changchun. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Okamura, accompanied by Major Kita, Vice Adjutant Izumi, and Secretary Haku, traveled to Tianjin by car this morning, escorted by Yin Tong and Shibayama. Okamura stated that his visit to Tianjin to see Yu was merely a courtesy call and did not involve any specific tasks. He had arranged to meet Yu at 2:00 PM this afternoon and would fly back to Changchun from Tianjin tomorrow. He planned to make brief stops in Jinzhou and Shenyang en route. Regarding the opening of traffic on the Beining Railway, the return of the Great Wall passes, and the establishment of customs posts, a general agreement had been reached during his stay in Beiping. In the future, the specific implementation would be handled by specialized personnel from both sides' transportation and finance departments. As the restoration of postal services in the Northeast was complicated, it was not discussed. China and Japan are contiguous lands and as closely related as lips and teeth. It would be a great pleasure if both countries could treat each other with sincerity and improve relations. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Semi-official source: Okamura's visit to Beiping was to exchange opinions with Ke Yingguan on the handover methods. The result was satisfactory. The Beiping-Shenyang traffic event was not discussed in detail. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The unfinished matters in the North China war zone have been discussed by Okamura and Huang He after coming to Beiping. A considerable range of principles for implementation have been agreed upon. In the future, China and Japan will proceed according to this range, which roughly divides into three items: (1) Opening Traffic on the Beining Railway: The issue of opening traffic is based on the principle that the route both inside and outside the customs is the property of the Beining Railway. Therefore, the authorities have defined a method for opening traffic according to our principles. If the other side agrees, it can be realized in the short term. Okamura has taken this method to Changchun to pass it on to the Kwantung Army authorities. In the future, Yin Tong and Xia Guangyu, a counselor from the Ministry of Railways, will negotiate with the Japanese embassy. (2) Establishing Customs at the Great Wall Passes: Previously, the customs posts in the Northeast were located in Yingkou and Binjiang. Moving them to the Great Wall passes would be tantamount to excluding the four northeastern provinces from the national territory. The scope of discussion is to temporarily use the Yingkou and Binjiang customs for rear office work, rather than openly establishing customs and collecting taxes at the Great Wall passes, to avoid tacit recognition of the Manchurian state. The Ministry of Finance has already dispatched Tax Commissioner Ding to the north to assist in the matter. The customs posts established by the puppet regime in places like Yuguan and Gubeikou will not be recognized. (3) Returning the Great Wall Passes and the Withdrawal of Japanese Troops: As there are already provisions in the Tanggu Truce, there should be no problems. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Okamura took a train to Tianjin this morning and plans to stay for one day before returning to Manchuria because Rikarit ordered him to quickly return and report the results of his visit to Beiping. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Before leaving Beiping, Okamura stated that he only exchanged opinions with the Beiping Chinese authorities on the two issues of opening traffic between Shenyang and Beiping and establishing customs posts in the Great Wall area. All principles have now been agreed upon, but the details must be determined by experts. Okamura denied having discussed the issue of postal services between China and "Manchukuo" and stated that China and Japan, due to their geographical relationship, need to cooperate. He felt gratified that the relationship between China and Japan had progressed during this trip. According to Chinese sources, the Ministry of Finance has now sent representatives to Beiping to discuss the establishment of customs posts along the Great Wall. These customs posts will be regarded as relocated from Harbin and Newchwang, so as to avoid the appearance of recognizing the Great Wall as the southern border of "Manchukuo." It is reported that the Chinese authorities asked Okamura to pay attention to the "Manchukuo" troops stationed in Malanyu protecting the tombs, saying that this task should be undertaken by Chinese special police. Okamura promised to discuss it in Changchun. Okamura is scheduled to take a flight from Tianjin to Jinzhou tomorrow, and then take a train to Changchun to report the results of this trip to Rikarit. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Okamura went to Tianjin by car this morning and will stay for one day before flying to Changchun. It is reported that the reason Okamura is in a hurry to stay in Tianjin is that he was summoned by Rikarit to report on the results of the discussions in Beiping. According to the official announcement issued here today, the matters discussed between Okamura and the Beiping authorities were only two: one was the problem of post-war aftermath in Fuling and the other was the problem of returning Shanhaiguan. The results of the discussion were very satisfactory. As for the issues of postal services and railway traffic, they are being discussed by experts. However, negotiations will not be held until the responsible departments have approved the methods. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to reliable sources in the Beiping military and political circles, the Kwantung Army Deputy Chief of Staff, Major General Okamura, and others came to Beiping this time to discuss two items with the two chairmen, Huang and He: the post-war aftermath of bandit suppression in Fuling and the methods for receiving Yuguan. After several exchanges of views, the results obtained were satisfactory. The reported issues of traffic and postal services have to wait for experts to study the plan and submit it to the competent departments for a decision before discussions can begin, so there were no specific discussions this time.

<h3>President Wang of the Executive Yuan Attends the Legislative Yuan to Report on Diplomacy with Japan and Answer Questions from Various Committee Members</h3>
<p>All Diplomatic Cases Are Handled in Accordance with the Instructions of the Central Political Committee; Our Various Ministries and Commissions Are Currently Studying Issues Such as Postal Services</p>
<p>The Legislative Yuan Holds a Closed-Door Meeting to Discuss the Issue of Import Duties on American Cotton and Wheat</p>
<p>(Nanjing) President Wang of the Executive Yuan attended the Legislative Yuan on the 10th. After Wang took his seat, the Legislative Yuan immediately held a closed-door meeting, chaired by President Sun. First, a committee member explained the reasons for inviting Wang to attend. Wang then reported on the international situation in recent days and the recent situation between China and Japan, for more than an hour. After the committee members listened to Wang's report, Lou Tongxun, Liu Guanxun, and others stood up and spoke one after another. It was almost noon at that time. Wang calmly replied, "I will give a comprehensive answer to the various questions you have raised. The international affairs handled by the Executive Yuan are in accordance with the instructions of the Central Political Committee. The powers of the Central Political Committee are conferred by the Central Standing Committee. The Central Standing Committee represents the Party Congress and is directly responsible to the people. Japan has made proposals on the issues of traffic and postal services. Our side is organizing a specialized committee composed of the departments of Transportation, Finance, Foreign Affairs, and Railways to study the response. There have been no negotiations yet. In short, the Executive Yuan handles diplomatic events in accordance with the policies stipulated by the Central Government." After speaking, he saluted the chairman and left the meeting. The committee members also dispersed. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 10th, a closed-door meeting was held to discuss the issue of collecting import duties on American cotton and wheat. It was resolved to hand it over to the Finance and Economic Committees for review. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After convening a meeting on the morning of the 10th, the Legislative Yuan immediately held a non-public meeting to exchange views on the current diplomatic situation from the Legislative Yuan's perspective. After a break of about half an hour, at 10:00 AM, President Wang of the Executive Yuan arrived at the Yuan by car, accompanied by Sun Ke, to report to all legislators on the Executive Yuan's handling of diplomacy, which lasted for two hours. According to Sun Ke after the meeting, Wang came to the Yuan to report on the diplomatic process in great detail. Regarding the diplomatic situation in North China, Wang said that the Executive Yuan could not act unilaterally and still had to follow the Central Government's decision and make decisions on how to deal with it at any time. After Wang's report, the members of the Yuan also contributed many opinions, but because it was a reporting matter, no resolutions were made. Song Ziwen is in Shanghai and still has matters to deal with and will not come to Nanjing for the time being. Only Wang and Wang are in Nanjing in the Economic Committee, so they cannot hold regular meetings, and the meeting affairs are still being promoted as usual. (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Some members of the Legislative Yuan plan to draft a written opinion on diplomatic issues and make recommendations to the Central Government. (10th Dispatch)</p>

Because a puppet organization once sent a company of puppet troops, under the guise of protecting the mausoleums, to station in the area, our side has made a statement to the Japanese side that the Eastern Tombs are a product of our country's history, and we have the full ability to protect them, and there is no need for the puppet state to station in the area. The Japanese side has agreed to order the puppet state to withdraw. There are no preparations for whether the Xinglong County area protruding beyond the Great Wall will be recovered in the future.

<h3>Jiangxi Camp Welcomes Zhang Ji and Presents the Flag; The Guard Parades Through the City Holding the Flag; The Provincial Party Headquarters Also Holds a Meeting to Welcome Him</h3>
<p>(Nanchang) The Camp held a ceremony in the auditorium at 10:00 AM on the 9th to welcome the Central Representative Zhang to present the honorary flag to Jiangxi. All officers above the rank of major participated. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, after performing the ceremony, Zhang delivered a speech, which roughly stated that China is now facing both internal and external troubles, which is the most serious period in history. The Central Government is committed to maintaining internal stability and resisting foreign aggression. The comrades in arms in Jiangxi are suppressing bandits, which is to do the work of maintaining internal stability. The Central Government highly appreciates this. The Sixth Division's 34th Regiment won a miraculous victory in Xun Kou, which is especially commendable. Therefore, the honorary flag is awarded to reward the meritorious. It is hoped that all armed comrades will be as brave and hardworking as the 34th Regiment, and the Red bandits will be wiped out in the near future, etc. Chiang gave a speech, which roughly stated that he was very welcome and grateful that Representative Zhang of the Central Party Headquarters brought the honorary flag here. This time, the 34th Regiment fought fiercely with the bandits for five days and five nights and achieved the final victory. The credit is not small. The Central Government awarding the honorary flag is an supreme honor. I remember that in the Huizhou Campaign in the 14th year of the Republic of China, the Central Government awarded a prize once. This is the second time in eight years, and its glory is like a rest. Now, the large-scale bandit suppression is indeed an important task of stabilizing the interior before resisting foreign aggression. All of our officers and soldiers must use the spirit of perseverance to eliminate the Red bandits, complete the revolutionary cause, and repay the Central Government for giving us this special honor. After the ceremony, a group of actors and musicians from the camp marched through the city with the honorary flag held high. The flag was rectangular, six feet high, and embroidered with the four big characters "Qí Dòng Mào Zhù" on blue satin. At 2:00 PM, the Jiangxi Provincial Party Headquarters convened various mass organizations in the provincial capital to hold a meeting in the auditorium to welcome Representative Zhang. Zhang's speech was very heroic. He said that the Red bandits originally occupied Hunan, and the bandit leaders were mostly from Hunan. Now Hunan has been stabilized, but the bandits in Jiangxi are still rampant. This is because the fertile land in Jiangxi is fertile and productive, and the people are weak and peaceful, not resisting. It is hoped that the people of Jiangxi will wash away their decadence, take Wang Anshi and Wen Tianxiang as examples, and cheer up. The Red bandits are really not worth worrying about.

<h3>League of Nations Declares Non-Recognition of Puppet Organizations</h3>
<p>— Yuan</p>
<p>On June 14th of this year, the State Council, in the name of the Advisory Committee, proposed a plan regarding the non-recognition of the puppet state of Manchukuo. It circulated this plan to member and non-member states of the League of Nations, and also sent letters to the representatives of the eighteen nations on the committee, stating that if no objection was received, the plan would be considered established. Now, according to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, ten replies have been received, all expressing support. The United States, in its reply, indicated that if the puppet organization requests to join any international treaties, such as the Kellogg-Briand Pact, the U.S. government will not give it any attention. Britain, pointing out the omission of the two conventions on maritime safety and load lines in the notification, insisted on joining, making its attitude of non-recognition very clear and resolute. Other small countries, such as Cuba, Venezuela, Haiti, Colombia, and Nicaragua, also generally acknowledged the principle, but were still considering the listed items. Only Siam showed slight hesitation, but only stated that it had no relationship with Manchuria and did not express opposition. It can be seen that the world's nations are clearly and unanimously against the puppet state of Manchukuo. The reason why the world's nations unanimously deny the puppet state of Manchukuo is that the puppet state of Manchukuo was created by Japanese aggression, seizing Chinese land to place it under another power, destroying Chinese territory, which is undeniable. Now the League of Nations' non-recognition of the puppet state essentially recognizes that the land of the puppet state of Manchukuo belongs to China, to express its intention to protect the territorial integrity of its member states. Although it cannot go so far as to sanction Japan with force, this fair claim can still impose some restraint on those who rely on force. On the one hand, it can make the Chinese people aware that justice still exists in the world. Since the world's nations do not recognize the puppet state of Manchukuo, it means that Manchurian territory has not yet reached a point of no return due to accommodating established facts. There is still a glimmer of hope left for our people to strive for. Our people, if they are not insane, will increase their belief in recovering lost territory. Our national strength may be weak, but the desire to recover lost territory has never been forgotten. How can it be that the world's nations sympathize with us in not recognizing a puppet organization created by force, while our people would bow down and accept it? This is what we dare to resolutely express in accepting the League of Nations' good intentions.</p>
<p>However, the League of Nations' Opium Advisory Committee's handling of this issue is very puzzling to us. Yesterday, the Kuomin News Agency reported that today's decision on the report would refer to any places involving the Manchukuo puppet organization as "Manchuria and Jehol, also known as 'Manchukuo'," etc. This technical naming is due to the fact that the committee members, after Secretary-General Drummond announced last night that major countries almost unanimously advocated maintaining a policy of non-recognition of the puppet organization, decided on it. This ambiguous and skillfully evasive resolution has already made us suspicious. According to today's Havas News Agency report, the Japanese representative, Yokoyama, requested that the name of Manchuria and Jehol in the report be annotated with the words "i.e., the territory of the so-called 'Manchukuo'." After review by the legal department, it was approved. This is even more bizarre. As mentioned earlier, using technical naming already violates the League of Nations' impartial attitude. If, as today's Havas report says, the annotation "territory of the so-called 'Manchukuo'" is added at the request of Japan, it shows a contradiction with the policy of major countries unanimously advocating maintaining non-recognition of the puppet organization. It also contradicts the US reply, which stated that it would never pay attention if the puppet organization requested to join any international treaty. Even if the Japanese have sophisticated diplomatic tactics, combining inducement and coercion, how could the legal department dare to rashly bear the responsibility of undermining the League of Nations' unified policy? If the news reported by Havas is accurate, we know that the League of Nations will definitely find a way to salvage it and eliminate the stain of its self-contradiction and internal inconsistency.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Advisory Committee Passes Opium Report; Danger of Secret Drug-Making Plants in the Far East</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Today, the Opium Advisory Committee passed a report on the illegal trade in narcotics, which explicitly stated the danger of secret drug-making plants in China and the Far East and drew attention to the increasing amount of high-concentration opium imported into India from the Far East in recent years. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Advisory Committee on Opium Issues passed a report containing the following points: (1) Illegal trafficking; (2) Cooperation between Chinese authorities and authorities in the concessions; (3) Supervision of opium and narcotic drug trafficking in Manchuria and Jehol; (4) Various issues related to the 1931 Convention for Limiting the Manufacture and Regulating the Distribution of Narcotic Drugs; (5) Bangkok Conference and Convention; (6) Organization of the Advisory Committee, etc. Japanese delegate Yokoyama requested that the name "Manchuria and Jehol" in the report be annotated with the words "i.e., the territory of the so-called 'Manchukuo'." After review by the legal department, it was approved. The report to be submitted by the Opium Advisory Committee to the League of Nations will briefly explain the work of the 17th session of the Committee, which opened on October 30 and closed today. Regarding the issue of confiscation, the subcommittee will hold a meeting before the Advisory Committee meeting to review various reports and other documents related to illegal trafficking. The report of the Advisory Committee on Opium Issues requests the League of Nations Executive Council to pay attention to the following points: (1) Various small factories secretly manufacturing narcotics all over the world; (2) High-concentration opium illegally transported from the Far East to India, which had decreased at some point, has now increased again; (3) Narcotics secretly transported from ports in Europe and the Far East to the United States; (4) New methods used by illegal traffickers to avoid inspection. The US representative made an important declaration to the Committee regarding private trafficking, stating that some people are using private aircraft to smuggle alcoholic beverages and narcotics into major North American countries. The report also stated that attention should be paid to the use of international sleeping cars for smuggling narcotics. The committee does not advocate listing the names of merchants who privately traffic in narcotics, but requests the committee's secretary to supplement the index contained in the report of the detention agency at any time. This index contains the names of the most important and well-known private traffickers, as well as their relationship to a certain smuggling case. Regarding the issue of cooperation between Chinese authorities and treaty countries, the committee believes that supplementary investigations are necessary regarding legislative events and the difficulties encountered by various agencies. The committee also believes that it is necessary to encourage Chinese authorities and foreign representatives in China to exchange information. The committee paid particular attention to the fact that the authorities of the so-called "Manchukuo" have adopted and promulgated various measures, the result of which will make opium a monopoly. The "Manchukuo" authorities are using this to increase important revenue. The committee received reports proving that the policies implemented by "Manchukuo" not only increase drug addiction in Manchuria and Jehol but will also endanger other countries. The report also requested that major producing and manufacturing countries closely monitor requests for the transportation of narcotics to Manchuria and Jehol. Finally, the committee also suggested that Turkey, Canada, and a certain country in the Scandinavian Peninsula participate in the Advisory Committee and requested the Executive Council to approve it. Before adjourning the meeting, the Advisory Committee expressed regret over the withdrawal of the German representative, saying that Germany's position is extremely important in terms of manufacturing and commerce, and its departure has a great impact on the success or failure of the Advisory Committee's work. It is hoped that the country will soon be able to participate in cooperation again, and the vacancy left by its representative will not be filled for the time being. (Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Policy Towards China Follows Decisions Made at the Five-Minister Conference</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) During today's cabinet meeting, some officials raised questions about the situation of the Nanjing government. Foreign Minister Hirota replied that no matter what measures the Nanjing government takes, the Japanese government must base its steps on the fundamental policy decided at the Five-Minister Conference.

<h3>Soviet Russia Announces Protest Note to Japan Regarding Japanese Aircraft Intrusion into Russian Airspace; States that This Act is Unprecedentedly Violent, Demanding Guarantees for the Future and Punishment of Those Responsible</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Since the Soviet Russian government denounced Japanese military aircraft for flying into Russian territory and violating territorial rights, relations between the two countries have become increasingly distant. There is clear evidence today. The Soviet Russian ambassador to Japan's protest note to the Japanese Foreign Ministry regarding the aircraft trespassing incident was also released by the Russian government today. The wording in the note is strong, claiming that this act is an unprecedented violation of Soviet Russian territory, which shows the Russian side's emphasis on this matter. According to political sources, at the Soviet Russian celebration of the 16th anniversary of the Communist Revolution the day before, ambassadors from various countries participated in the grand ceremony, but Japanese Ambassador Ota did not attend the parade. In the evening, when Soviet Russian Central Executive Committee Chairman Kalinin formally received congratulations, Ota did not go either. This situation, as well as the fierce speech by Soviet Russian People's Committee Chairman Molotov on that day, has aroused much commentary. It is generally believed that there has been little progress in relations between the two countries. (Kuomin News Agency dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Soviet Ambassador to Japan Yurenev, on the orders of the Soviet government, submitted a protest to Foreign Minister Hirota on November 6 regarding Japanese military aircraft flying into Soviet territory. The memorandum pointed out that on November 3, eight Japanese reconnaissance planes and one bomber flew to the vicinity of Slavjanka and Barabash on the west coast of Amur Bay. Japanese military aircraft flew over numerous locations within Soviet territory, 25 to 30 kilometers from the border. The memorandum further stated, "I am authorized by the Soviet government to protest against this violent and unprecedented intrusion into the Soviet border, and insist that such actions not occur again in the future. A thorough investigation of the truth of this incident must be conducted, and the aforementioned flight personnel must be punished." The conclusion stated, "I wish to express my firm belief that the Japanese government will be able to take effective steps to satisfy this statement." (TASS dispatch, 8th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Foreign Ministry States that a Russian-Japanese War Would be Unfavorable to Both Sides; Believes There Is a Need to Ease the Atmosphere</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) At a time when the resumption of diplomatic relations between the US and Russia is about to be realized, the Soviet Russian side issued a warning to Japan, saying that Japanese aircraft flying into the Primorsky Krai region without authorization will lead to unpleasant consequences. The Japanese Foreign Ministry released the following views last night: There are currently no disputes between Japan and Russia that would trigger a crisis of war. Moreover, a Russian-Japanese war would be unfavorable to both countries. From a historical and experimental point of view, it is true that small matters can disrupt the situation. Therefore, it is necessary for the Japanese and Russian authorities to find ways to improve the atmosphere between Japan and Russia. Regarding this point, Foreign Minister Hirota warned Ambassador Yurenev, but Soviet Russia is still repeatedly engaging in anti-Japanese propaganda, which is unreasonable. If peace between Japan and Russia is disrupted, the responsibility lies with Soviet Russia. Japan welcomes the resumption of diplomatic relations between the US and Russia from the perspective of world peace and human well-being. It is incomprehensible that this goodwill and tolerance are used to launch anti-Japanese propaganda as a tool of international diplomacy. We cannot help but be disappointed by such narrow and short-sighted policies on the part of the Soviet Russian authorities. Regarding the current issue of Japanese military aircraft, Soviet Russia believes that the United States is most concerned about the Japanese military's strategy to conquer the Primorsky Krai, so it is using this point to engage in counter-propaganda, hoping to benefit the resumption of diplomatic relations between the US and Russia. However, Japan has absolutely no such facts, and can ignore it. (Dentsu dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspaper Reports Rebellion of Red Army Villagers Along Ussuri Railway; Sixteen Aircraft Burned</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Tokyo Jiji Shinbun reported that villagers and Red Army soldiers near Vyazemskaya along the Ussuri Railway have rebelled, and their momentum is growing. The Red Guards along the Ussuri Railway are also stirring. It is reported that the rebels have massacred hundreds of Communists and burned sixteen military aircraft. The leader of the rebels flew an aircraft to distribute leaflets, urging the people to respond, but was shot down by government forces. The unrest has a tendency to spread, but officialdom has not yet received any real news. Someone inquired at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs about the source of this news. It is said that it came from a certain Russian newspaper in Harbin and was spread as an extra edition. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>Indian-Japanese Conference Suffers Another Setback</h3>
<p>Delhi The final, eleventh plenary session of the Japanese-Indian conference, slightly delayed from the scheduled time, convened at 5:00 PM today. Based on the government's final instructions, the Japanese representatives put forward the following final proposal: (1) The standard for the quantity of Indian cotton purchased is one million bales. Abolish the fixed system. For each additional bale, increase cotton cloth by 200 yards. The maximum quantity of Indian cotton purchased is 1,375,000 bales, and the quantity of cotton cloth exported is 400 million yards; (2) Although Japan opposes the classification of cotton cloth by variety, considering India's position, it acknowledges mutual flexibility. Unprocessed goods account for 45%, and cloth other than processed goods accounts for 55%. The numbers in this proposal by the Japanese side are based on the actual performance of Japanese cotton cloth imports from last year to the seventh year in the trade statistics investigated by the Indian Ministry of Commerce. India did not state any opinions on this, replying that it would consult with Indian operators before answering again. The meeting adjourned at 5:50 PM. The negotiations, which were expected to be the last, suffered another setback due to India's uncooperative attitude. (Dentsu News Agency dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>French Parliament Questions Government's Foreign Policy; Leaning Towards Japan Will Cause Dissatisfaction with the United States; What Attitude to Take in a Japanese-American Conflict</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Chamber of Deputies convened at 9:40 AM, chaired by Speaker Herriot, to continue presenting questions on foreign policy. Tedinri, a deputy from Paris belonging to the Republican League, took the stage to question the attitude adopted by the French government to maintain European peace after Germany decided to withdraw from Geneva. Macaigne, a deputy from the Radical Socialist Republican Party, then took the stage to question the government's foreign policy, saying, "If we lean towards Japan, we will inevitably cause dissatisfaction with the United States. In the London Economic Conference, we overemphasized currency and neglected economic issues." Macaigne recounted the difficulties encountered by President Roosevelt's economic and financial policies, saying that in order to solve the consumption problem, it is necessary for mutual understanding between the various nations. However, the French Foreign Ministry does not have time to take care of the situation in the East, which is a pity. In the East, there are one billion residents, and if their consumption capacity increases, the French export industry will definitely benefit from it. Finally, Macaigne questioned, if France is attacked by Germany, which countries can be France's arms? He also said, what point of view will France take when conflicts arise between China, Japan, and the United States in the future? At this point, the Speaker announced that the discussion would be postponed until 3:30 PM. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>Resumption of Diplomatic Relations Between the US and Russia Imminent; Litvinov and Hull Meet for the Second Time; Diplomatic and Commercial Matters Largely Agreed; Awaiting Roosevelt's Final Decision</h3>
<p>(Washington) The complete restoration of diplomatic and commercial relations between the United States and Russia is now expected to be announced by the White House after a formal meeting between the US President and Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov tomorrow afternoon. Litvinov was originally scheduled to meet with the President at 5:00 PM this afternoon, but it was postponed by one day because some issues had not yet been agreed upon. However, it is heard that these issues are not difficult. Litvinov also held talks with US Secretary of State Hull at the State Department for two hours today. This was the second conversation between the two, but government officials expect that all issues can be resolved before the President receives Litvinov tomorrow. The US market has been hoping for a statement on the resumption of diplomatic relations for three days. It is said that if the meeting unfortunately breaks down, the entire pharmaceutical and financial community will be greatly disappointed, because the business community expects that after the resumption of diplomatic relations, a trade agreement can be established, allowing American manufactured goods and some agricultural products to gain a large market in the Soviet Russian market. (Kuomin News Agency dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov and US Secretary of State Hull met for two hours today and have agreed on the basis of understanding regarding diplomatic and economic relations between the two countries, which will be submitted to President Roosevelt for approval this afternoon. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>Talk Delayed; Provokes Speculation</h3>
<p>(Washington) The White House and the State Department are absolutely silent on the reason for the delay in the talks between President Roosevelt and Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov. The newspapers also have no explanation for this. The New York Times said that the details of the talks are not disclosed, indicating that differences may have arisen between the views of the US and Russian governments. The Ming Sheng Jiang Tan Bao also does not deny the possibility of differences between the views of the two countries. Some sources said that Undersecretary of State Bullitt will be appointed as the US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, while others said that Henry Morgenthau, President of the Farm Credit Administration, will be appointed. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>White House Banquet; Toasts and Merriment</h3>
<p>(Washington) On November 8, Litvinov met with US Secretary of State Hull and held talks for more than two hours. At the end of the meeting, Hull led Litvinov to a gathering of journalists. Litvinov made a brief statement, saying, "I am very pleased in Washington, because I have found a friendly atmosphere here that supports my mission to the United States." Hull and Litvinov subsequently issued a joint statement, stating, "We have conducted very friendly and private discussions on a number of issues regarding Soviet relations. These talks are purely preliminary and have not discussed detailed proposals." After that, Roosevelt held a banquet at the White House to entertain the guests, including Litvinov, Soviet Intelligence Director in Washington Svirski, Manager of the US Company Tangdanov, Secretary of the Soviet Foreign Ministry Dievierkovski, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Committee Umanjski, the US Secretary of State, the Minister of Agriculture, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of Commerce, and other important officials of the US government. Litvinov then went to the State Department to continue talks with Hull. This talk continued on the 9th, and Litvinov met with Roosevelt again at 6:00 PM in the evening. (TASS dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>Two Treaties; Conclude Negotiations</h3>
<p>(Washington) The US-Russian negotiations will roughly conclude with two treaties, one being a treaty of political and economic non-aggression, and the other being a treaty defining aggressor countries. According to this treaty, "any country that sends troops to a country outside its own territory is an aggressor." There is originally no danger of war between the US and Russia, but those responsible for mediating the two countries cannot but guard against the danger of economic conflict between the two sides.

<p>Dr. Edina Discovers Deep Sterilization Method</p>
<p>Physicians Worldwide Now Have a Cure for Gonorrhea</p>
<p>"MATHEZIN" MOST EFFECTIVE ANTI-GONORRHOIC CUN Inventor of German White Turbidity Special Medicine, Matherzin Star, Dr. Edina's Portrait</p>
<h3>The Reason Gonorrhea is Difficult to Treat</h3>
<p>The difficulty of treating gonorrhea is a common cry from both the medical community and patients. There are many reasons why gonorrhea is difficult to treat. First, after the acute symptoms of gonorrhea have passed and it becomes chronic, the patient no longer experiences severe pain and is unwilling to continue treatment to eradicate the disease. This is because the patient lacks the patience. Second, the patient does not understand the methods of self-care, such as sexual activity, alcohol consumption, overwork, etc., all of which prolong the duration of gonorrhea treatment. Third, there is the issue of finances; there is no money for treatment. However, from our medical perspective, the most significant reason gonorrhea is difficult to treat, aside from the reasons mentioned above, is due to the anatomical structure of the urethra. The urethra has many mucous glands along its path, such as Littre's glands, Cowper's glands, and the prostate gland, all of which open into the urethra. Physicians can use antibacterial drugs to kill the gonococci in the urethra, but it is difficult to kill the gonococci lurking within these glands. Therefore, gonorrhea that appears to be cured on the surface can recur when exposed to various triggering factors such as fatigue, sexual activity, and alcohol consumption. This is because the gonococci lurking within the glands emerge and cause trouble again. Therefore, to eradicate gonorrhea, an experienced physician must use a new deep sterilization technique to treat these gonococcal nests properly, only then can it be eradicated!</p>
<h3>New Method for Eradicating Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>It has already been stated that gonococci are difficult to eradicate, and only by treating the gonococcal nests can the gonococci be eradicated. How can gonorrhea be considered eradicated? This is also something that both physicians and patients desire! From a medical perspective, the elimination of gonococci is considered a cure for gonorrhea. However, simply finding no gonococci during a urine test is not enough because gonococci still lurk deep within the mucous membranes. When opportunities arise, such as sexual intercourse, alcohol consumption, or labor, it will recur. It must be proven that the deep gonococci have indeed been eliminated before the goal can be considered achieved. What method can be used to prove that there are no gonococci deep within? Physicians simply use a new deep sterilization drug called "Matherzin Star"! It completely kills all the latent gonococci. If no gonococci can be found after using this method, and there are no other suspicious symptoms, it can be considered eradicated. After three months, half a year, or a year, the same method is used again, and if there are no gonococci and the condition is good, then the gonorrhea is completely cured!</p>
<p>One more thing, even if a man is completely cured, if his infected wife is not treated at the same time, the treatment is useless.</p>
<h3>The Therapeutic Action of the Special "Matherzin Star"</h3>
<p>"Matherzin Star" is a special and effective drug for eradicating gonorrhea and turbidity, developed by German Dr. Edina after spending forty years of painstaking effort, conducting 255 animal experiments, and sending it to 878 venereal disease hospitals worldwide for testing, before finally achieving success! "Special Matherzin Star" is a new creation that has been further researched and recently successfully developed after the invention of "Matherzin Star". Its dominant medicinal properties and rapid efficacy can be described as perfect and flawless, and it is by no means comparable to ordinary white turbidity pills on the market. It is truly the greatest new contribution to the medical and pharmaceutical fields of the 20th century!</p>
<p>(1) This agent has the special feature of specifically penetrating into the deep mucous membrane gland cells of the male and female genitals to kill all the gonococci. Therefore, the urine of those who have taken this drug also has extremely strong bactericidal power. For example, for 20 patients who have taken "Matherzin Star" internally for more than seven days, taking five "Kram" of their urine and adding one "platinum loop" of gonococci can kill them within 15 minutes. This is the most amazing fact in modern medicine!</p>
<p>(2) The medicinal properties are mild and have no side effects. It is by no means comparable to sandalwood oil and inferior drugs, which cause hundreds of drawbacks such as harming the stomach and intestines and hindering fertility.</p>
<p>(3) It specifically treats acute and chronic gonorrhea, white turbidity, leucorrhea in women, cystitis, urethritis, and other diseases, and has repeatedly proven effective results.</p>

<h3>Germany to Propose New Proposals for Reorganizing the League of Nations and Returning to Disarmament - Including the Resumption of Armament Tabulations and Relating to Goering's Visit to Rome - British Prime Minister Expresses Willingness to Give Fair Consideration</h3>
<p>(New York) It is rumored here among Germans that Germany will propose concrete measures for reorganizing the League of Nations and resuming disarmament talks early next week. The nature of this proposal is moderate but includes the resumption of armament tabulations. (Reuters, 9th)</p>

<p>(London) British Prime Minister MacDonald spoke at the Mayor's banquet tonight, first discussing domestic political achievements, and then international events. He said that Britain has never wasted a penny on anything not necessary for national defense, and armaments have never spared the country from war. Therefore, Britain is now trying its best to eliminate the suffering of all countries. Regarding disarmament matters, if Germany is willing to continue, Britain is definitely willing to do so. Germany must be a signatory to a satisfactory disarmament convention. Germany's current position is not suitable for Germany, nor is it suitable for Europe, because it cannot make it reasonable. Foreign Minister Neurath recently indicated that Germany will propose a new method. If Germany does have it, then its new proposal will definitely receive the most satisfactory and fairest consideration. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>Secret Report of the Allied Military Commission - Belgian Prime Minister Hymans Asks Not to Publish - Deep Fear of Provoking Serious Disputes</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Although there is now renewed hope for the disarmament issue due to Germany's return to the disarmament conference and consideration of amendments to MacDonald's draft, there are still many obstacles ahead. In Belgium, it is said that a secret report of an Allied military committee is about to be published. If published, it will be enough to threaten the entire issue of peace and disarmament. According to sources in Brussels, Senator Taulot suddenly claimed during the debate in the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Belgian Senate that Germany had never disarmed and had never been sincere in disarming. The Germans had deceived the Allied Military Commission for many years. "I have obtained a copy of the committee's report, which is enough to prove this statement." Thereupon, Belgian Foreign Minister Hymans immediately asked Taulot not to publish the report, saying that its publication would cause serious international disputes and major conflicts between countries. Now that Germany has presented conditions for returning to the disarmament conference to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, hope for a final agreement among the powers has greatly increased here. However, it is feared that once the issue of whether Germany is faithfully fulfilling the Treaty of Versailles is raised, it will hinder all efforts to dispel misunderstandings.

<h3>Geneva Continues to Work</h3>
<p>Disarmament Cadre Forms Committee</p>
<p>Review British Plan Separately</p>
<p>(Geneva) The main committee of the Disarmament Conference reconvened today to discuss various issues. What was decided today was that a committee composed of representatives of the main committee from countries such as Britain, France, Italy, Spain, Norway, and Poland will review the disarmament draft separately and then synthesize it. This new committee has decided to hold its first meeting tomorrow. As for when the main committee will meet next, it has not yet been predicted. Therefore, today's work is only to show that the work of the Disarmament Conference is uninterrupted. (National, 9th)</p>
<h3>Italian Premier Probes British and French Atmosphere</h3>
<p>Rome Reports here indicate that after Italian Prime Minister Mussolini spoke with Prussian Premier Goering, he immediately met with the British and French ambassadors and held long talks with them. It is believed that Mussolini is now actively seeking to restore diplomatic relations between the countries as soon as possible, but at the same time, there is no enthusiastic expression. Therefore, it can be seen that Mussolini's plan is still uncertain, and what Mussolini is doing is just probing the atmosphere. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's Son's Impressions of Traveling in Europe</h3>
<p>(New York) President Roosevelt's eldest son has returned home after traveling in Europe and has issued a statement saying that the European situation is now improving. "When Germany withdrew from the League of Nations, I was in France. My impression was that no country in Europe wanted war, because no country could afford the enormous cost of war." (Havas, 9th)</p>
<h3>At the Sound of the Whistle, All of Germany Ceases Business to Listen to Hitler's Final Election Speech - Hitler Urges the People to Unite to Achieve the Goal of Protecting and Eliminating Treaties</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The gist of Hitler's final election speech at the Siemens factory this afternoon is as follows: "I speak to you, I am determined not to be higher than you, because I share the same origins with you, and I have always been with you." Hitler then described the reasons why he was ordered to take over the administration in times of crisis, saying that our country had already fallen into bankruptcy, and as a result of bankruptcy, our people suffered its poisonous effects. This can only happen once and never again. The reason I engaged in political struggle is because I firmly believe that our people have been poorly educated and poorly governed in the past. I am not responsible for the war, and you are not responsible for it either." (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) German Chancellor Hitler claimed today in his final election speech broadcast from the Siemens factory that the Germans cannot live under the shadow of the Treaty of Versailles for long. During this broadcast speech, which reached the entire country, the employees of factories and stores gathered in front of the loudspeakers to listen to the German Chancellor's remarks, and even the diners in restaurants ate quietly in order to listen quietly. Although the government publicized it vigorously, the public did not show much attention to Sunday's election, because they knew in advance that Hitler would win a majority of the votes. The German Chancellor's speech was interrupted for four minutes during the broadcast, and it was said that someone had caused trouble. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today, the final preparations are being made for the general election. At one o'clock in the afternoon, Chancellor Hitler will deliver his final election speech in front of 12,000 workers at the Siemens factory in Berlin and will broadcast it to various places so that the people of the whole country can hear it at the same time. The Siemens factory's engine manufacturing plant is one of the largest factories in Germany. Hitler will deliver his speech in the middle of the large motors of this factory. At exactly one o'clock in the afternoon, the large whistle of the Siemens factory sounded, announcing the start of an unprecedented demonstration to Germany. Throughout the country, upon hearing the sound of the whistle, all activities were immediately stopped. Workers left their factories, employees left their offices, and vehicles on the streets were all stopped for one minute. Thousands of people gathered in front of the radio loudspeakers to listen quietly to the Chancellor's speech. However, electrical and gas factories, hospitals, fire trucks, major news agencies, railways, and aviation businesses continued to work. The Chamber of Commerce requested its members to close their businesses for one hour from one to two o'clock in the afternoon so that the shop assistants could listen quietly to the Chancellor's speech. Taverns asked their customers to order food before one o'clock in the afternoon so that all work would be stopped at one o'clock. Several theaters in Berlin temporarily opened their doors so that the public could enter the halls for free to listen to the Chancellor's speech. In short, the Propaganda Department used all kinds of methods to ensure that this final election demonstration had a very significant nature. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<h3>German Former Crown Prince Does Not Forget the Humiliation of Signing the Treaty - Advises People to Support Hitler</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Former German Crown Prince Wilhelm published an article in the Börsen-Zeitung today entitled "The Incident of November," in which he recounted past events and indicated that many historically valuable events, whether auspicious or inauspicious, would be greatly related to November. Wilhelm claimed that fifteen years ago, the German nation was attacked by Marxist traitors and suffered a fatal wound, forcing it to submit and sign the Treaty of Paris, which was on November 11th. However, this year's November 12th will be the day when the German people restore their honor. Everyone should rise up and vote for Hitler. Wilhelm then greatly praised Hitler's great achievements.

<h3>British House of Commons Opposition Party Advocates Active Disarmament</h3>
<p>(London) The impeachment motion against the government proposed by the House of Commons opposition party on November 13 will contain the advocacy of active disarmament. It will request the government to send this proposal to the Disarmament Conference in order to completely abolish all forms of aerial bombardment and to abolish all kinds of war equipment that the Treaty of Versailles does not allow Germany to establish, such as tanks, heavy artillery, battleships, aircraft carriers, submarines, and sea and land aircraft. The government is also requested to propose: (1) international management of civilian aircraft, (2) immediate reduction of military spending in all countries, (3) elimination of private arms manufacturing and trade, (4) international inspection of armaments, (5) establishment of an international police force, (6) formulation of a definition of aggression based on the proposals of the Disarmament Committee.

<h3>Hitler's Origins in the Green Forest - Ten Years Ago, He and Goering Were Wounded Simultaneously in a National Coup</h3>
<p>Munich The current German Chancellor Hitler was the leader of the Green Forest heroes ten years ago and worked hard to promote the National Socialist Party. At that time, the Bavarian government police arrested him in the Odeonsplatz area. Sixteen of his subordinates died, and he and the current Prussian Minister of Interior, General Goering, were both wounded. Today marks the tenth anniversary. Today, there is a National Socialist Party parade in Munich, and Hitler still takes the road from the site of the battle that day to the Odeonsplatz area, where 100,000 members of the National Socialist Party's stormtroopers greet him. After the commemorative ceremony, Hitler flew to Berlin to prepare for the election competition.</p>
<p>German Monks' City In 1923, when the National Socialist Party first attempted a coup here, many party members suffered misfortune. A monument has recently been erected for them. The unveiling ceremony was held today, presided over by Chancellor Hitler, who stated that it was gratifying that the German army and the awakened people were united as one. Germany has always had peaceful intentions. He asked the people of the whole country to help Germany demand equal rights. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia Gives Katayama a State Funeral - Japanese Representative Blasts Araki Military Clique</h3>
<p>(Moscow) After the death of Katayama, the oldest Japanese revolutionary and member of the Presidium of the Communist International, a solemn funeral was held today in Moscow's Red Square. Tens of thousands of male and female workers and members, as well as several Red Army units, gathered in Red Square to pay their respects. Representatives of communist parties from various countries, such as Beck of Germany, Marti of France, Okin of Japan, and Wang Ming of China (transliteration), all delivered eulogies. Kanovich, representing the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, spoke, praising Katayama's important role in the labor movement and recounting the deceased's history of opposing imperialism and the struggle against imperialist provocations in the Far East. Kanovich said that there are no differences or conflicts of interest between the Soviet proletariat and the Japanese toiling masses. Afterwards, the urn containing Katayama's ashes was placed inside the Kremlin wall, and cannons were fired in mourning.</p>
<p>(TASS, 9th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The funeral of Japanese Communist Party elder and former member of the Executive Committee of the Communist International, Sen Katayama, became a magnificent procession attended by more than 150,000 people. The box containing Katayama's ashes was carried from the Trade Union Hall to Red Square by Stalin, Molotov, Kaganovich, Orjonikidze, Piatnitsky, and other representatives of communist parties from various countries. Following them were members of the Executive Committee of the Communist International, members of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party and the Central Supervisory Committee, members of the Executive Committee of the Red Trade Union International, members of the Executive Committee of the Labor Assistance Society, members of the Old Bolshevik Society, members of the Moscow Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, and friends and assistants of the deceased. A memorial meeting for Katayama was held in Red Square. The opening speech was delivered by William Beck, representative of the Executive Committee of the Communist International. Beck praised Katayama's tasks in the international labor movement. The next speaker was Marti, who vigorously stated that Katayama was a resolute enemy of Japanese imperialism to the death. Marti pointed out that Katayama used extremely sharp words to expose the true nature of the Japanese army's occupation of Manchuria, and indicated that the creation of "Manchukuo" was merely an excuse, a mask, to cover up the Japanese imperialism's specially planned military preparations to attack the Soviet Union. Then, Okin, the representative of the Japanese Communist Party, described the life of this deceased revolutionary in vivid words, and his courageous and uncompromising struggle to win the Japanese people's solution. He said, "The Japanese military clique headed by Araki is preparing to attack the Soviet Union, and Katayama left us a mortal struggle to oppose Japanese imperialism, oppose patriotism, strive for the liberation of Korea, Taiwan, and China from their oppressors, strive for the liberation of the entire oppressed Eastern working masses, and always maintain a united friendship with the Soviet Union. Katayama also left us with loyalty to the Soviet Union, and a relentless struggle against imperialist provocations and counter-revolutionary imperialist wars. If Japanese imperialism is truly going to point its bloody hand at the Soviet Union, we vow to transform this war into a civil war, into a war to liberate the Japanese working masses and the oppressed colonial people from the brutal rule of Japanese capitalists and landlords, and to overthrow the hegemony of the Japanese autocratic military clique." Wang Ming (transliteration), the representative of the Chinese Communist Party, spoke next, and the meeting ended. Then, Stalin, Molotov, and others carried the ash box to the Kremlin and placed it inside the wall. After cannons were fired in salute, the magnificent procession of Moscow workers passed through Red Square to pay their last respects to this communist leader. (TASS, 10th)</p>
<h3>Afghanistan Will Have a Power Struggle and Internal Strife - Calls for Former King Amanullah to Return to Power</h3>
<p>North-West Frontier Province Informed sources here predict that Afghanistan will have internal strife over the struggle for the throne. Army Minister Sama Momand Khan announced the accession of the new king for convenience. It is said that he now occupies a key position. Prime Minister Hasan Khan is currently touring the northern provinces and has not yet announced his will. Therefore, King Nadir's brother, the current ambassador to France, Zahir Khan, intends to seize power. A section of the public advocates the restoration of former King Amanullah. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>New Delhi The Indian government, fearing disturbances within the country after the assassination of the King of Afghanistan, ordered the closure of the Khyber Pass between India and Afghanistan this afternoon, cutting off traffic from Afghanistan to India. However, the Indian-Afghan border remains quiet as usual. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) The King of Afghanistan, Nadir, was assassinated, and his son, who is only nineteen years old, is now succeeding to the throne. It is still questionable whether he can be safe and sound. This incident was not accidental, but a long-planned result of eliminating the royal family. Since the assassination of the King of Afghanistan, the people in northern India have been panicked. According to the confessions of the assassins, their assassination of the king was due to their anger at his pro-British stance. Many British newspapers say that Amanullah, the former King of Afghanistan, who is now living in Rome, is probably related to the Afghan revolutionary movement, because the revolutionary party and Amanullah share the same aspiration of breaking away from Britain and becoming independent. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>North-West Frontier Province Today, it was rumored that the King of Afghanistan, Nadir, was killed by his servant when he left the inner palace. The servants fired three shots and then killed him with a sword. The news of the King's assassination spread immediately to the border tribes, but the tribes are still peaceful today. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Afghan ambassador to France, the brother of the late King Nadir, claimed today that the return of former King Amanullah is out of the question because the former king ignored the habits and customs of the people and has been abandoned by the people. The new king will continue Nadir's policy of good neighborliness. According to the reports he received, the assassination was committed by thugs and has no political relationship. Whether he will return to the country is still undecided. (Reuters, 10th)</p>

<h3>US Dollar Plummets After Gold Purchase Policy Implementation; Panic in New York Financial Circles; Potential Impact on Gold Pound's Status; England May Retaliate</h3>
<p>(New York) US Dollar Plummets; People Anxious. The *New York Times* financial reporter states it is beyond the government's control. The foreign exchange market is quite alarmed. After government bonds fell yesterday, demand for the British pound is increasing. The international value of the US dollar is now below the standard set by the Financial Reconstruction Agency. England's position is threatened, and it may retaliate. There is much speculation in banking circles about whether the ten million dollars in gold previously submitted to the Federal Reserve Bank will be returned to the treasury for use as an exchange rate stabilization fund. *The Commercial Daily* reports that the Financial Reconstruction Agency maintained the dollar yesterday and raised the acceptance rate to prevent the outflow of short-term debt because of capital outflows exceeding its scope. *The New York Dispatch* reports that foreign central banks are purchasing fewer bank acceptance bills from the Federal Reserve Bank, about two-thirds less than before, because central banks of various countries are selling US dollars, fearing its continued decline. It is widely expected that the US dollar will continue to fall today. Some say the Bank of England will wait until the pound reaches a price of US$5.25 before using its foreign exchange to lower its gold holdings. (10th Reuters)</p>

<h3>Conflict Between Postal Workers and Station Police at Beijing Railway Station; Many Seriously Injured on Both Sides</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) At 7:00 AM on the 10th, when the No. 6 train from Shanghai arrived at the station, postal unloading workers were still entering and exiting through the south gate. Passengers' luggage, postal packages, and workers were all exiting on the same path, causing severe crowding. Station police squad leader Li Junhai and others negotiated with them, but the workers refused to obey instructions, leading to an argument and then a violent fight. Dozens of postal workers swarmed and attacked, causing chaos. Li Junhai was struck in the waist and head and lost consciousness, suffering severe injuries. Patrolmen Ni Xizhi, Feng Deyan, and Dong Yiming were also seriously injured. Inspector Wang Shutian of the police department was also nearly beaten. Subsequently, the railway police authorities dispatched multiple patrolmen to suppress the situation, and the violent fight finally ended. Nine postal workers involved in the attack, including Yun Yunchang, Sun Xianying, and Kong Ru, were arrested on the spot. Upon hearing the news, the post office immediately sent two personnel to the station to investigate the truth and inspect the injured railway police. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Jiangning Shangxinhe Township Carpenter's Resistance to Arrest; County Government Schedules Court Hearing</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the case of the Shangxinhe Timber Industry Union workers gathering and clashing with the Jiangning County Shangxinhe Township Public Security Bureau and Security Corps, the Jiangning County Government has scheduled a court hearing for the workers on the 13th. This case involves the carpenters' Luban Festival on the 4th, where workers from various gangs of the union held separate gatherings and meals. The Jing and Hui gangs gathered at the Great King Temple, which was originally built by the two gangs but is currently being used by the Tenth District Security Corps as a training camp. On that day, the training camp temporarily vacated the main hall for the workers to gather, with a low fence erected in the courtyard as a boundary. While the workers were drinking, some proposed playing cards, but before the game could begin, gambling police arrived. While they were arguing, Police Chief Huang Liang led a second batch of police and immediately tied up nine workers, injuring two. Those who escaped called for help, and members of other gangs, their families, and onlookers, numbering several thousand, surrounded the Great King Temple. It was dark, and only three or five gunshots and a chorus of cries were heard. Later, after mediation by District Chief Xiao Jie and others, the police released the nine bound workers to the union for punishment. Afterward, the union sent the injured workers Wu Chen and Tang Guangji to the local court for examination. The Tenth Police Bureau also reported the workers' riot to the Jiangning County Government, and the county government issued a summons for the union's executive director Lu Zuofan to appear in court on the 13th.

<h3>Ancient Zeng State Tomb Discovered in Ancient Yin Dynasty Village; Spring and Autumn Culture Can Be Studied Here; Another Remarkable Discovery in Archaeological Work in Southern Shandong</h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch. The Shandong Ancient Sites Research Association, jointly established by the Academia Sinica and the Shandong Provincial Government, has been excavating the ancient capital sites of the Shang, Zhou, Spring and Autumn, and Warring States periods in the three counties of Zou, Teng, and Yi in southern Shandong. Since work began on the Cao Wang tomb in Anshang Village, Teng County, many remarkable discoveries have been made, attracting significant attention from various places. Recently, near the ancient Yin Dynasty village of Egukou, 30 miles north of Yi County, the ancient site of the ancient Zeng State tomb from the Spring and Autumn period was discovered. According to a long-distance telephone report from the Yi County Magistrate: Yi County was the land of the Zeng State during the Spring and Autumn period. The State of Chu established the Lanling Town here, and the State of Jin established the Lanling Prefecture. In the Jin dynasty, it was established as Yi Prefecture, and it was changed to a county only after the Ming Dynasty. The Zeng State appears to be the surname. During the Spring and Autumn period, it was destroyed by the State of Ju. Therefore, the history of Yi County is quite long. Egukou Village, thirty miles north of the city, is said to be an ancient Yin Dynasty village, with records to prove it. Broken bricks, tiles, and porcelain shards are everywhere outside the village, with an ancient feel and evident remains. About two miles west of the village is Xiaoguojiazhuang, where two ancient tombs were recently discovered, having collapsed from the ground. The ground cave is about five feet deep. Inside the cave, a stone house opens eastward, with huge stones inlaid on the outside. The door is supported by a bluestone beam about ten feet long, decorated with lotus flowers, elegant and refined. The interior is dark, and no one dares to enter. A pole several feet long was used to probe, but there were no boundaries. Another tomb is located half a mile southwest of this tomb, in a barren mountain area, with the same shape. At present, the easternmost one has been covered with huge stones and soil by the landowner because it interfered with farming, and it cannot be seen again. According to the identification of archaeologists on these ancient tombs, it has been confirmed that they are Zeng State tombs. Although they have not yet been excavated, the external observation is sufficient to express the greatness and exquisiteness of ancient architectural art. It is likely that these ancient tombs are by no means owned by ordinary people, or they may be related to the imperial family. At present, the residents of the village have sent a letter to the Yi County Party Headquarters. Upon receiving the report, Yan Yudong, a member of the Standing Committee of the County Party Headquarters, personally went to investigate. Considering that the matter concerns ancient cultural relics, he has sent a letter to the Yi County Government, requesting permission to excavate, collect, and preserve the relics. It is expected that after excavation, its value will be even higher than the Cao Wang tomb in Anshang Village, Teng County. (9th)</p>

<h3>Results of Huang Fu and Okamura's Negotiations; Content of Traffic Plan Secretly Guarded; Both Okamura and Yin Tong Express Optimism</h3>
<p>----Dispatch</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondent: After Okamura Yasuji, the representative of the Japanese Kwantung Army, arrived in Beiping, he formally met with Huang Fu and He Yingqin at the Diplomatic Building the day before yesterday. The principles of various issues were negotiated and agreed upon. Detailed measures will be discussed and agreed upon as they are implemented. Huang and He went to the Fusang Hotel yesterday morning (8th) to visit Okamura in return. The conversation lasted about an hour. Okamura and others felt that their mission in Beiping had been completed and visited the Summer Palace today (9th) and are scheduled to go to Tianjin tomorrow (10th) to meet with Yu Xuezhong. After a brief discussion, they will return to Changchun by plane on the 12th. Yin Tong, the director of the Beining Railway Bureau, has drafted a concrete plan for the traffic issue on the Beining Railway. Xia Guangyu, a specialist sent by the Ministry of Railways to assist in the handling of the matter, submitted the plan to the Ministry of Railways for review. The content of the plan is strictly kept secret. However, it is reported that the only requirement is that, in addition to the vehicles of the Beining Railway, vehicles of other railways cannot enter Guan Nei. The Japanese side has formally recognized and returned the various passes of the Great Wall. Our side will send administrative personnel and security teams to receive them. The specific measures will be submitted by the Hebei Provincial Government to the Political Affairs Readjustment Committee for approval. The handover can be completed as soon as both sides agree. The procedure is not complicated and is expected to be realized in the shortest time possible. The Japanese army at each pass will only be able to withdraw completely at the end of the month. The establishment of customs is more complicated and requires detailed planning and measures from the Ministry of Finance. The postal issue is being studied to determine the method of using stamps. According to Yin Tong, the director of the Beining Railway Bureau, this morning, the opening of the Beining Railway has been decided by the bureau's administrative meeting. However, the content of the plan will be kept secret for the time being. The reception of the various passes of the Great Wall has been the result of Okamura's visit to Beiping. However, the opinions of the two sides on other matters have not yet been completely consistent. According to Okamura, his visit to Beiping was very satisfactory in discussing various issues with the two chairmen, Huang and He. The matters discussed were all agreed upon in principle, not concrete plans. The future of China and Japan will proceed according to these principles. Politically, there are still many difficulties, but economically, it is believed that cooperation can be gradually achieved. The return of the various passes of the Great Wall is of course no problem. The withdrawal of the small number of Japanese troops stationed within the war zone is also a matter of course. However, because the construction of labor camps outside Guanwai has not been completed, it will take some time. Opening to traffic and postal services are what we eagerly hope for. Although there has been no detailed discussion, we also hope to achieve this soon. From the talks of Yin Tong and Okamura, the content of the negotiations between the two sides in recent days can be glimpsed. (November 9)</p>
<h3>The Xinjiang Incident: From Jin Shuren to Sheng Shicai, and the Relationship Between the Northeast Army and the New Situation</h3>
<p>Dihua Correspondence: Since the founding of the Republic of China, internal wars have raged for years, and hardly any province has been spared. However, Xinjiang had remained relatively peaceful. Although there were occasional conflicts between the Hui and Han peoples, these were localized issues that were resolved through pacification. However, after Jin Shuren assumed power in Xinjiang, his mismanagement of military and political affairs, coupled with exorbitant taxes and levies, left the people with no means of survival. At the same time, he imposed a media blackout and implemented policies to keep the people ignorant. Political corruption was rampant, and bribery was commonplace. These factors led to the outbreak of the first Xinjiang Incident. The main players in this incident were Jin Shuren and Ma Zhongying. Jin was a Han Chinese, while Ma was a Hui. In addition to the struggle for power, there was also ethnic animosity between them, leading to mutual slaughter that claimed over ten thousand lives. When the fighting broke out, Jin realized that his troops (the current provincial army) were incapable of combat and retreated in defeat every time. He was eventually forced to flee, and command of the provincial army was handed over to his chief of staff, Sheng Shicai. At that time, Ma's army had advanced to a point very close to the provincial capital, vowing to kill all Han Chinese and establish a Northwest Hui Autonomous Alliance. He also sought to form a Hui nation by collaborating with Turkey. Ma was a young, radical leader of the Hui New Teaching sect. Even the assets of Ma Fuxiang's family were confiscated by him. However, despite his youth, Ma acted recklessly, relying solely on his courage and lacking modern knowledge and political ideas. He was essentially a chieftain from the tribal era.</p>
<p>After Jin fled, the remnants of his army were reorganized by Sheng Shicai, and the provincial government was taken over by Zhang Peiyuan, the commander stationed in Ili. At that time, Ma Zhongying was winning every battle and seemed poised for total victory. He sent plainclothes soldiers to operate in the suburbs of Dihua, resulting in the deaths of many Han Chinese. As a result, the city of Dihua was alarmed several times each night. Fortunately, over two thousand troops from the Northeast Anti-Japanese Army under Su Bingwen suddenly entered Xinjiang via Russia, and six thousand troops from the Jilin Self-Defense Army under Li Du also arrived from Russia. Su and Li's troops were not only well-disciplined but also highly capable in combat, greatly boosting the morale of the provincial army. The siege of Dihua was lifted, and the Han Chinese in the city welcomed them with food and drink. However, Su and Li's troops were reluctant to participate in the internal conflict. The generals sent letters to Ma Zhongying, urging him to stop the fighting and, at the very least, to strictly prohibit ethnic killings. Ma, emboldened by his victories, disregarded their pleas and continued his killing and looting. For the sake of the hundreds of thousands of Han Chinese and for their own self-preservation, Su and Li's troops resolutely assisted the provincial army (i.e., Sheng Shicai) in attacking Ma. Ma was decisively defeated, almost to the point of complete disintegration. In this battle, the Northeast Army suffered casualties including Brigade Commander Liu and Regiment Commanders Yu and Lu, illustrating the intensity of the fighting. After suffering a crushing defeat, Ma Zhongying retreated to Hami, Turpan, Shanshan, and other places, gathering his remaining troops, which numbered only four thousand, half of whom were old and weak. Sheng and Liu seized the opportunity to send a telegram to the entire nation, declaring themselves chairman and director, claiming to have been elected by the people. Sheng and Liu, having just started anew, had not yet consolidated their power, so they did not pursue Ma relentlessly. Instead, they seized the opportunity to call a truce, focusing on internal consolidation and seeking support from Soviet Russia. Ma also wished to use this time to recuperate and plan for a resurgence. Thus, the first incident came to an end, and the political power of Xinjiang fell into the hands of Sheng, Liu, and others, who continued to implement a policy of isolation. At this time, Sheng had essentially become the dictator of Xinjiang. When the central government ordered Huang Musong to enter Xinjiang to provide comfort and attempt to resolve the Xinjiang issue thoroughly, Sheng and Liu became greatly alarmed, fearing that their positions would be threatened. They decided to go all the way, placing Huang under house arrest as a condition for coercing the central government to issue military and political orders. At that time, mail and telegrams were censored, martial law was imposed, and the situation was extremely tense. Chen Zhong, Li Xiaotian, and others were unjustly shot dead. At this point, Sheng and his allies completely disregarded the central government.</p>
<p>Sheng Shicai currently has two infantry brigades, totaling 2,300 men, consisting of the original provincial army. They lack training and are prone to vices. In addition, there is a White Russian army brigade of 1,500 men, called the Naturalized Army, which is prone to drunkenness and disturbances and has very poor discipline. The Northeast Army captured over a thousand men in battle against Ma Zhongying's army, who were then formed into a guard regiment stationed at the governor's office. These thousand-plus men had been with Ma for a long time, so the people were generally fearful that they would be difficult to subdue. Recently, a mutiny occurred, further proving their unreliability. In short, Sheng's direct troops total over four thousand men, but only twenty to thirty percent are combat-ready. Sheng's ability to maintain his position is entirely due to the mutual constraints of the various factions. The Northeast Army, under the rallying cry of the Hui people that all Han Chinese must be killed, had no choice but to temporarily cooperate with Sheng Shicai for self-preservation. Zhang Peiyuan, in order to preserve his strength, sat back and watched the蚌鷸相爭 [idiom for two parties fighting and a third benefiting], waiting to reap the fisherman's reward. Thus, due to the balance of power, Xinjiang will fall into a state of perpetual turmoil. Unaware of this, people in society often mistake the Northeast Army for Sheng Shicai's own troops, but this is purely speculation and conjecture. The Northeast armies have their own history and system and will not be exploited by others.</p>
<p>As for Ma Zhongying, although he was defeated, he was not eliminated because he was a local native and a radical leader of the youth faction. Therefore, his latent power is greater than Sheng Shicai's. Thus, the current situation in Xinjiang has become a standoff between Sheng and Ma. Zhang Peiyuan only has three thousand troops and has not dared to attempt any of the previous struggles, believing that whoever wins between Sheng and Ma will not benefit him. As for Sheng's source of pride, it is his reliance on the support of the Northeast armies. Therefore, he is extremely ingratiating with the generals of the Northeast armies. The chief of staff of the directorate, the head of the military affairs department, the director of the arsenal, the officer of the military academy, the garrison commander of the provincial capital, and the commander of the guard regiment are all figures from the Northeast Army. On the surface, Sheng seems extremely humble and sincere, but he has ulterior motives. If the Northeast Army were to leave Sheng and remain neutral, the political situation in Xinjiang would change dramatically. This is because among the various factions in Xinjiang, the Northeast Army has the most men and the strongest fighting ability. The key to resolving the situation in Xinjiang in the future may lie here.</p>
<h3>Situation of the Great Fire in Xuzhou - Location is the Emerging Commercial Center - Estimated Losses Exceed 500,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: The Datong Street area of Xuzhou is a transportation hub connecting the city and the train station, and it is also an emerging commercial center. It is the most prosperous area in the city. Recently, due to social depression, the people's purchasing power has disappeared, and the shops on Datong Street have been holding competitive sales to attract customers. Lanterns and decorations are hung, and the night market is particularly lively. Recently, the Shanghai National Goods Touring Group arrived in Xuzhou, and Xuzhou also held a National Goods Promotion Week at the same time, setting up a market at the Garden Hotel to exhibit and sell goods. As a result, the shops on Datong Street became even more enthusiastic. Even the three or four shops that were usually closed for inventory and accounting temporarily opened to auction off goods. However, on the evening of the 8th, just as the electric lights were turned on, a fire suddenly broke out in the eastern section of the street. In an instant, the prosperous market was engulfed in flames, with people running away in panic, women crying, and children screaming. The scene was unbearable. The fire was extinguished at 9:00 p.m., after burning for four hours. Over eighty buildings were destroyed, and the losses are estimated to be at least 500,000 yuan. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Cause of the Fire</h3>
<p>At 5:00 p.m. on the 8th, shops on Datong Street, in order to promote sales, not only installed double the amount of electricity but also installed gasoline lamps for the convenience of the night market. The building in front of the Garden Hotel, built along the north side of the street, consisted of ten interconnected buildings, totaling ten upper floors and ten lower floors. The three westernmost buildings were the Tianzhang Silk Store, the four central buildings were the Xietongshun Silk Store, and the three easternmost buildings were the Yuanzhang Paper Store. A gasoline lamp on the upper floor of the Xietongshun Store exploded due to excessive pressure, spraying gasoline everywhere and scattering sparks. The Tianzhang and Xietongshun Stores had also installed large electric spotlights with high power, which also exploded as a result. Electricity and gasoline mixed and spread the fire. The goods piled up in these two stores were mainly wool, silk, and cotton textiles, while the Yuanzhang Store was entirely filled with paper, all of which were easily flammable. Therefore, within ten minutes of the fire starting, the ten upper and ten lower floors were completely engulfed in flames, and the fire was raging fiercely, making it impossible to approach. The crowd panicked. The police officer on duty frantically blew the whistle, and the fire brigade from the Public Security First Branch and Second Sub-branch was dispatched. At the same time, gongs were beaten to warn people, and various fire brigades rushed to put out the fire.</p>
<h3>Spread of the Fire</h3>
<p>After the building in front of the Garden Hotel was set ablaze, the temporary sheds set up behind the building for the National Goods Exhibition were quickly dismantled. Fortunately, the building was very tall, and the back walls were all made of brick and stone, so the fire did not spread. In front of the building, there was a row of workshops. The fire spread southward, igniting the Tonghegong Grocery Store across the street. The Jiufug Silk Store, which shared a wall with the Tonghegong Store on the east side, also caught fire. Flames flew across the street, and the fire brigades driving water hoses from the west could not pass through. They drove the hoses to the west of the fire and sprayed eastward. The fire brigades from Gulou Street and Wenting Street also set up water hoses to the west of the fire. At that time, the wind was blowing from the southwest to the northeast, so the fire did not spread westward but continued to spread eastward, setting fire to the front building of the National Goods Commercial Building on the north side of the street. The building was separated from the building in front of the Garden Hotel by only a small alley. The fire first spread to the Dacheng Cigarette Store on the west end, followed by the Zhonghua Shoe Store, the Juqinglong Grocery Store, the Dinghua Foreign Goods Store, the Meizu Clock and Watch Store, the Wild Rose Ice Room, the Yuanhetai Cigarette Store, and the main entrance of the Zhongjia Commercial Building, totaling eleven buildings. The fire became even more intense. Fortunately, the fire brigades from the Jinpu and Haizhou Railway Companies and the Dongguan Charity Fire Brigade arrived and set up hoses to the east of the fire to spray water. They also demolished the straw houses on the east side of the front building of the commercial building, preventing the fire from spreading further eastward. However, the building was also tall, and when the fire was raging, it spread to the opposite side of the street, setting fire to the Meihua Photo Studio and the Jiuzhang Military Uniform Store. The Nankai Fire Brigade arrived early from the New South Gate and set up hoses to the south of the fire to spray northward, preventing the fire from spreading southward. By about 8:00 p.m., the fire had begun to subside. At that time, black smoke billowed from the rubble, and the water hoses from the east and west were able to pass through the streets and engage in extinguishing the remaining embers.</p>
<h3>Security and Maintenance</h3>
<p>When the fire started, there were many visitors in the National Goods Exhibition Hall, and Datong Street was also crowded. People panicked and ran in all directions, causing great disorder. The Seventh Division Cadre Training Team, which was closest to the fire, was ordered by Education Director Zhou Tiren to deploy. Police officers from the Public Security Bureau rushed to the scene, and military and police posts were stationed on the streets and alleys. The visitors in the exhibition hall were blocked by the fire at the front gate and had to exit through the back door. At the height of the fire, Jinpu Garrison Commander Wang Jun, County Magistrate She Nianzi, Public Security Bureau Chief Wang Shicai, Seventh Division Political Training Director Long Ciyun, Second Recruitment Director Chen Xueshun, and various branch bureau chiefs and town chiefs all arrived at the scene to inspect and direct the maintenance of order. Therefore, the order was relatively good. However, the owners of neighboring shops who had not insured their goods moved their belongings to a more distant open space, piling them up like mountains. Some even watered quilts and covered them on the roofs to prevent the flames from spreading. The sound of crying and the sound of police whistles were heart-wrenching. Datong Street was covered in mud and water, with hardly a clean spot. After 9:00 p.m., the situation gradually calmed down, but the aftermath continued.</p>
<h3>Stray Flames Cause Trouble</h3>
<p>Between the front building of the Garden Hotel and the front building of the commercial building, there was a small alley with several straw houses. When the fire was raging, they were not set ablaze due to the distance. However, stray flames landed on the roofs, which was not noticed at the time. After the fire was extinguished and the distant water hoses had returned, the straw houses suddenly caught fire again, and whistles and gongs were sounded again. Fortunately, the fire brigade had not yet returned, and the water hoses that had returned halfway rushed back. In an instant, several straw houses were reduced to ashes. Fortunately, when the initial rescue was carried out, the roofs of the buildings had already been sprayed with a lot of water, preventing the fire from spreading. After 10:00 p.m., the fire was completely extinguished, and the embers were watered overnight. Datong Street was under martial law all night.</p>
<h3>Loss Statistics</h3>
<p>The losses from this fire, excluding the goods of the various shops, which are difficult to estimate accurately, include the following buildings destroyed: Six buildings on the north side of the street belonging to Tianzhang, eight buildings belonging to Xietongshun, and six buildings belonging to Yuanzhang. These were the buildings in front of the Garden Hotel, owned by Wu Jihong, with four kitchens attached behind the buildings. Two buildings belonging to Dacheng, four buildings belonging to Zhonghua, six buildings belonging to Juqinglong, six buildings belonging to Dinghua, and two buildings belonging to the main entrance of the commercial building. Two buildings belonging to the Wild Rose and Yuanhetai, and two buildings belonging to Meizu. These were the buildings in front of the commercial building, owned by the public, with two bungalows attached behind the buildings and a teahouse at the entrance of the small alley. Six buildings on the south side of the street belonging to Tonghegong, with three back rooms, two buildings belonging to Jiufu City, with one back room, owned by Wu Guangyuan. Three buildings belonging to Mei City, with one back room, three buildings belonging to Jiuzhang City, with three back rooms, owned by Tiancheng Company. In addition, there were three straw houses in the north alley. In total, eighty-three buildings of various sizes were burned down. If the construction costs and goods are included, the estimated losses are at least 500,000 yuan. However, the exact figures are still being thoroughly investigated. This is a true catastrophe. The Shanghai National Goods Touring Group did not suffer any losses. As for the people, one employee of the Xietongshun Store was slightly burned by the fire. Those who had insurance have already reported the incident. The authorities have already summoned the person in charge. As for the aftermath of the fire, the town chief and deputy superintendent of Datong have convened a joint meeting and will coordinate with the authorities to carry out all the necessary measures.

<h3>Nanchang Guyi Garden Opens for Chrysanthemum Viewing</h3>
<p>Nanchang Guyi Garden is a famous scenic spot handed down from the Ming Dynasty. During the January 28 Incident, it was occupied by Japanese invaders for more than a month, and the scenery in the garden was almost completely destroyed. This summer, the local people, in order to preserve the historical site, initiated a fund-raising campaign for repairs by Chen Shaoyun, Wang Quanshi, Li Liangcai, and others. They received enthusiastic donations from local gentlemen and merchants in Shanghai, and the construction work has been completed. However, it is said that a part of the project has not yet been fully completed due to economic limitations, and the initiators are still working hard to proceed, expecting that the old appearance will be fully restored soon. Furthermore, the town formerly had a Chrysanthemum Society, led by Ge Zhirang, the owner of Ge Garden, which cultivated many fine species over the years. After the war, it was completely destroyed. This autumn, chrysanthemum art enthusiasts have worked hard to search and collect them, and they have found fine flowers from various places, no less than a thousand or several hundred species. They have been opened in time now, and the society is scheduled to hold a chrysanthemum exhibition at Guyi Garden for ten days starting on the 11th of this month, with beautiful colors and a dazzling array. It is now convenient to travel to the town, and trains and cars can reach it directly. Those who have the elegant taste of Yuanming are welcome to come and evaluate it.</p>

Although Chen Zhou was middle-aged, she still retained her charm and had an affair with her neighbor Ren Mingqian. Xu Ayou was deeply dissatisfied with this and often argued. Therefore, Chen and others harbored resentment and developed murderous intentions.

<h3>Central Representative</h3>
<p>The Municipal Party Headquarters believes that the celebration of the Premier's birthday and the unveiling ceremony of the bronze statue are attracting a large number of party members and people from all walks of life in the city, making it an unprecedentedly grand commemoration. Therefore, it has specifically telegraphed the Central Executive Committee, requesting them to send personnel to Shanghai for guidance. It is now heard from the Municipal Party Headquarters that they received a reply telegram from the Central Secretariat yesterday, stating that it was decided to invite Committee Member Wu Tiecheng to represent and provide guidance. The original telegram is as follows: "To the Shanghai Special Municipality Executive Committee, we have received your telegram. The Central Committee has decided to invite Committee Member Wu Tiecheng to represent and provide guidance. Apart from sending a telegram, this is especially to inform you. Central Executive Committee Secretariat, Qingyin."</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Instruction</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Government instructed its affiliated agencies to hold separate gatherings for commemoration. The original order stated, "For compliance: According to the document submitted by the Civil Affairs Office of this government, stating that the Central Executive Committee Secretariat's Secret Document No. 16941 opens with: 'The methods for commemorating the Premier's birthday this year have been stipulated by the Central Committee. The day will be a holiday, and the national flag will be flown throughout the country for celebration. Party, government, military, and police agencies, groups, and schools in various places should hold separate gatherings for commemoration. The senior party headquarters in each location may also consider holding representative conferences. However, during this time of national crisis, there is no need for excessive extravagance. In addition to reporting to the party headquarters of various provinces and cities for compliance, a corresponding letter is requested for verification and for passing on the order to those under their jurisdiction for compliance, etc.' Based on this, it should be followed. In addition to instructing the office to reply and circulate the instructions, all should comply, and subordinates should be instructed to comply as well. This order."</p>
<h3>Citywide Business Closure</h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Government instructed its affiliated agencies not to engage in extravagance, all agencies have decided to fly the flag on that day and hold commemorative gatherings at 10:00 AM. All schools, factories, groups, and customs, banks, etc., will be closed for the entire day. All fleets of the Navy Department will fire salutes every morning to mark the occasion.</p>
<h3>Establishment Process</h3>
<p>The planning and establishment of the Premier's bronze statue began seven years ago. With the enthusiastic participation of artists at home and abroad, many plaster models were obtained. After review by the review committee, the one sculpted by Mr. Jiang Xiaojian was selected, and sculpting began immediately. Later, due to changes in events, it was delayed for a long time. The statue was originally scheduled to be erected in front of the Shanghai North Railway Station to allow the people of the city to admire it, and a foundation stone laying ceremony had already been held. However, due to the outbreak of the January 28th Incident, the North Railway Station was severely damaged. The Special Committee and the Municipal Government consulted and decided to relocate it to the municipal center, behind the Municipal Government Building, as the location was originally intended for the construction of a Premier's Memorial Hall. After the agreement, the construction of the stone base was started. Its position is behind the Municipal Government Building, about 50 meters away, and also about the same distance from the Memorial Hall site. It has now been completed and is entirely paved with white stone. The bronze statue is being molded and cast in Mr. Jiang's Meifeng Gold Casting Factory.</p>
<h3>Demeanor of the Bronze Statue</h3>
<p>The bronze statue is about eight feet tall, connected to a bronze base, with patterns and designs carved around it. Including the base, it is about nine feet tall in total, weighing about one ton. It is dark green in color, coated with a chemical solution to reduce its luster and give it a bronze appearance, preventing it from peeling off. The statue is in Chinese dress, wearing a long robe and mandarin jacket, holding a felt hat in his right hand and a bamboo cane in his left. Although the demeanor is very peaceful, the face seems quite haggard. This statue was taken when the Premier went north to Tianjin in 1924. At that time, the Premier had already been running around for the revolution for decades, experiencing excessive hardship and gradually showing signs of aging. Looking at his demeanor, one can know the great spirit of the Premier's dedication to the revolution.</p>
<h3>Relocation Yesterday</h3>
<p>After the statue was completed, it was moved from the factory to the city center for erection at about 10:00 AM yesterday morning. In addition to Mr. Jiang's personal guidance, Li Dachao, Section Chief of the Municipal Government, also accompanied to supervise. The statue faces south, and the Memorial Hall will be built behind it.</p>
<h3>Letter to the People of the Nation</h3>
<p>The Preparatory Committee of Shanghai's various circles for the construction of the Premier's bronze statue, in order to arouse the enthusiasm of the people of the country for commemorating the Premier, specially published an article "How Should the People of the Nation Commemorate the Premier?" The article stated: "This committee was established in the summer of 1928. Earlier, the citizens of Shanghai, considering that the Premier Sun Yat-sen's achievements were brilliant, and his character was great, not only contributing to the Party and the country, benefiting the people, and providing for future generations, but also that his spiritual appeal and ideological leadership were sufficient to make the weak stand up, reverse decline, and change customs, seeking the hearts of the people in drowning and turning the tide from collapse, were advocated by the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters, the Municipal Government, the Two-Roads Bureau, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, etc., to build a bronze statue of the Premier as a permanent memorial, and entrusted this committee to manage the matter. Although the review of the drawings slightly delayed the time in the past, what the citizens entrusted to this committee is now fortunate to have been successfully reported, and when the completion ceremony is held, it happens to coincide with the Premier's birthday. Seeing the brilliant bronze statue and performing the solemn ceremony, can this committee not feel ashamed of the citizens of Shanghai? However, although this committee is not ashamed of the citizens of Shanghai, this committee is actually ashamed of the Premier. Not only this committee, but also the citizens of Shanghai, and even compatriots throughout the country, should all feel ashamed of the Premier. The Premier was born on November 12, 1866, in a civilian family in Zhongshan, Guangdong, without any special reliance or superior environment. However, the Premier had the ambition to revive China since childhood. After graduating from the Hong Kong Medical School, he spared no effort to promote the revolution. After ten failures, he finally overthrew the autocracy and established the Republic of China. Subsequently, Yuan Shikai betrayed the country and claimed the title of emperor, Li Yuanhong destroyed the law and disrupted discipline, Zhang Xun restored the monarchy, and Cao Wu manipulated power, causing hardship for the people and shaking the foundation of the country. The Premier could not bear to sit idly by, so he again led the 'Anti-Yuan,' 'Protect the Constitution,' and 'Northern Expedition' campaigns, until the day he went north and passed away, he still earnestly said that 'saving China' was his goal. Unfortunately, reaching our generation, internal strife has been frequent and external troubles have come one after another. To this day, hundreds of counties in Jiangxi, Guangdong, Sichuan, Fujian, and other provinces are still reduced to bandit areas. The venue where we are standing today is the battlefield where the Japanese army galloped two years ago. And the four northeastern provinces that have been lost are even greater losses and unprecedented shame for our country. Embracing the broken rivers and mountains and comforting the haggard people, can we not feel ashamed of the Premier? If we encounter such a serious national crisis and still do not think of striving to be strong and avenging our shame, we are directly sinners of the Premier, and it is more than just feeling ashamed of the Premier. Therefore, our commemoration of the Premier should not be limited to erecting bronze statues and holding grand meetings. Bronze statues and grand meetings should be regarded as a reminder to ourselves rather than a commemoration of the Premier. If we have the sincerity to commemorate the Premier, we should carry on his legacy and take the Premier's ambition as our own ambition and the Premier's actions as our own actions. The invaded land in the Northeast has not been returned. How should we endure hardship and humiliation, boycott enemy goods, and strengthen national defense? The communist bandits in Jiangxi have not been eliminated. How should we donate wealth and grain to assist the soldiers and comfort the refugees? China is not the country of the government or a few people, 'Everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the world.' How should we each fulfill our responsibility to save the country? How should we contribute our individual intelligence, physical strength, and wealth, and even our entire family and life, to assist the government and jointly relieve the national crisis? People have a common saying, 'The Second World War is about to break out in 1936 (i.e., 1936).' (Because most of the world's arms limitation treaties expire in 1935 and 1936.) At that time, China will inevitably become the battlefield for Japan, Russia, and other countries. If our country can actively prepare today, we may be able to turn around and become the Turkey after the First World War. Otherwise, if we are allowed to be slaughtered, we will inevitably become a semi-colony divided into four or five parts. The situation is urgent. There are only three years left before the world war. We should immediately catch up and first assist the central government in suppressing the bandits and comforting the refugees, and then strive for construction in a stable society to enrich the people's strength and enrich the country's strength. Time, time, will not come again. Let us not miss this last opportunity."</p>
<h3>Parade by All Circles</h3>
<p>Tomorrow, after the meeting in the city center for the unveiling of the Premier's bronze statue and the celebration of his birthday, people from all walks of life will parade in the Nanshi area. As of last night, more than 5,000 people from all walks of life have registered to participate. It is said that the citizens will pay close attention to the parade.</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday to Host a Tea Party for the Financial Community. Kong Talks About Funding for the Bandit Suppression Campaign and Denies the Issuance of New Salt Tax Treasury Bonds.</h3>
<p>Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi flew to Jiangxi a few days ago in response to a telegram from Chairman Chiang to discuss the issue of suppressing the Red Army bandits. After staying in Jiangxi for a day, he took a plane back to Nanjing. Yesterday morning at 7:30, he arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing on an overnight train. At 5:00 PM, he held a grand tea party at his private residence on West Yanan Road to entertain the local banking community. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Xu and Zou Pay Respects</h3>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai yesterday morning, Kong first received Xu Kan, Director of the National Treasury Department of the Ministry of Finance, and Zou Bingwen, Member of the Cotton Industry Control Committee of the Economic Commission, at his residence at around 9:00 AM. They talked for about an hour before departing. Kong then met with reporters from various newspapers. At 11:15 AM, he took a car to the Central Bank to work.</p>
<h3>Bandit Suppression Funds</h3>
<p>When Kong met with reporters from various newspapers yesterday, he first stated that his trip to Jiangxi to discuss issues such as funding for the bandit suppression campaign with Chairman Chiang had already yielded considerable solutions. The current situation of bandit suppression is very smooth. If we do not want to suffer from the poison of the Red Bandits, we should cooperate from top to bottom and actively assist the government in completely suppressing the Red Bandits.</p>
<h3>Central Finance</h3>
<p>The Central Finance has a monthly deficit of approximately 12 million yuan, totaling approximately 140 million yuan annually. The deficit for this month has been resolved. As for the overall financial solution, I have repeatedly stated that I am determined to act based on the four words: "increase revenue and reduce expenditure." China's annual expenditure is only 800 million yuan in Chinese currency. Considering New York City in the United States, its annual expenditure is 700 million US dollars, a difference of four times. Given China's large population, vast land, and abundant resources, there is no need to worry about resolving the small deficit.</p>
<h3>Denies Salt Bonds</h3>
<p>When reporters asked if the recent rumors that the Ministry of Finance planned to issue 120 million yuan of salt tax treasury bonds were true, Kong replied that this was absolutely not true. Kong also corroborated Navy Minister Chen Shaokuan's denial, saying that it was unfounded.</p>
<h3>Tea Party Gathering</h3>
<p>Around 5:00 PM, Kong held a tea party at his residence on West Yanan Road to entertain the local banking, financial, and other important figures. Those who attended included Bei Songsun of the Bank of China, Li Fusun of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Hu Mengjia of the Central Bank, Wu Yunzhai of the Jincheng Bank, Hu Bijang of the Zhongnan Bank, Xu Zhanliu and Xu Jiyin of the Zhejiang Xingye Bank, Qian Xinzhi of the Four Banks Joint Treasury, Wang Huaizhong of the Yexin Bank, Chuan Xiaoan of the Tongshang Bank, Fan Jimei of the Qiye Bank, Song Ziliang of the Guohuo Bank, Tong Wenrui of the Jiangzhe Bank, Ye Fuxiao of the Dalu Bank, Xu Fu of the Shanghai City Bank, Lin Kanghou of the Bankers' Association, Zou Xieqing and Yu Zuoting of the Money Trade Joint Treasury, Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Liu Hongsheng of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Yu Qiaqing of the Sanbei Company, as well as Du Yuesheng and Zhang Xiaolin, and over a hundred others. Kong, accompanied by Xu Jianping, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance, warmly welcomed them and served tea and refreshments. They all dispersed happily around 7:00 PM.</p>
<h3>The Naming Ceremony of the Two-Road Aircraft Scheduled for the 18th at Hongqiao Airfield</h3>
<p>For the sake of promoting aviation to save the nation, the comrades of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, through the Special Party Department Bureau Trade Union of the railway, organized an Air Defense Fundraising Committee, working hard and sparing no effort. They have already raised more than 119,000 yuan in cash and have purchased an aircraft from the Aviation Association, named "Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo," and donated it to the government for defending the country and saving the nation. The naming ceremony is scheduled to be held on the 18th of this month at Hongqiao Airfield. In order to create a permanent memorial and for extensive publicity, the Fundraising Committee will print 10,000 copies of a commemorative album in advance and distribute them to various government agencies and public organizations throughout the country. At that time, the album will also be distributed by aircraft to the public along the route. However, in order to achieve twice the result with half the effort, the commemorative album is also intended to widely promote domestic goods and awaken the public to use domestic goods. The cover of the commemorative album and the inserted recruitment of domestic goods advertisements will use the lowest cost to achieve the greatest effect of promoting domestic goods.</p>

<h3>European Armistice Day Today</h3>
<p>Today is the 15th anniversary of the European Armistice Day. In this city, diplomatic and military officials of the former Entente countries, veterans, and representatives of the army, navy, business community, etc., will gather as usual at 8:30 AM in front of the Armistice Memorial Monument at the intersection of Edward Road to lay wreaths and commemorate the fallen soldiers. After 10:45 AM, the Union Church on Sima Road and the Catholic Church outside the New North Gate will hold special prayers. In the afternoon, the Cercle Sportif Français and the British Air Force Association will hold celebration banquets as usual. At 8:15 PM, there will be a similar grand banquet in the French Chamber of Commerce, which will be followed by dancing until late at night.</p>
<p>The British troops stationed in Shanghai will also hold an Armistice Day parade at the football field opposite the Jiaozhou Road barracks at 10:30 AM this morning. This year coincides with the rotation of the 1st Battalion of the Worcestershire Regiment and the 2nd Battalion of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. Both armies will be inspected together, and the outgoing Commander Major General Fleming and the new Commander of the British Forces in the Shanghai area, Brigadier Teakle, will also conduct the inspection together. After Major General Fleming's final inspection today, he will return to England on the troop transport ship Neuralia next Tuesday.</p>
<h3>Qi Zhanjiu of the Liaoning National Salvation Army Reports on the Anti-Japanese Struggle. Yesterday Afternoon, He Hosted the Press at the Atlantic Restaurant. He Led His Troops of More Than 50,000 Men in a Bitter Two-Year Battle.</h3>
<p>Qi Zhanjiu, Commander-in-Chief of the Liaoning National Salvation Army, along with Sun Yunwu, Chief of Staff, and Dou E, a representative of the army, returned from the front lines of Liaoning and arrived in Shanghai on the 7th. Yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM, he hosted the press at the Atlantic Restaurant to report on the experience of raising the banner of righteousness and leading his iron-blooded warriors in a bloody battle against the Japanese army since the September 18th Incident. The full text of the report is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, Zhanjiu and others, as active-duty soldiers, have fulfilled their natural duty to defend the border, united the Liaoning Provincial Border Defense Army, the people's militia of various counties in southern and western Liaoning, and patriotic volunteers, and organized the Liaoning National Salvation Army, totaling more than 50,000 people, to carry out the anti-Japanese work, fighting bitterly for two years. Initially, six divisions were formed, stationed in the mountains and forests of various counties in western Liaoning and southern Liaoning, acting according to circumstances.</p>
<h3>Destroying Railways</h3>
<p>When the Japanese invaders were probing into Jilin and Heilongjiang and attacking Jinzhou, Zhanjiu ordered the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Divisions to specialize in destroying the Yingkou-Jinzhou Railway and assist the provincial army in holding Dahushan and preventing enemy ships from transporting goods along the Liao River. The First, Second, and Sixth Divisions were tasked with destroying the South Manchurian Railway, from Shenyang to Haicheng, intercepting supplies from Dalian, disrupting the Japanese base in South Manchuria, and hindering the implementation of control near Fushun and the completion of highways in various counties. After Jinzhou fell on January 3 of last year, Zhanjiu ordered the divisions to continue working according to the original plan, and at the same time, contacted Zhang Haitian in Panxi West (i.e., Old Beifeng), Lu Shijie near Yingkou, Deng Tiemei on the Anfeng Line, and other units to engage in recovering the lost counties in western and southern Liaoning as a base for long-term resistance. Fortunately, the soldiers were brave, and within a few months, they successively occupied Panshan, Tai'an, Liaozhong, Liaoyang, Haicheng, Fengcheng, Niuzhuang, and other counties. This was the most prosperous period since the anti-Japanese war.</p>
<h3>Painfully Retreating</h3>
<p>This spring, after the loss of Rehe, the Japanese invaders invaded North China, and the armies guarding the Great Wall rose up to resist. Taking advantage of this opportunity, Zhanjiu and others contacted friendly forces and attacked Yingkou, intending to cut off the enemy's transportation throat. In the end, they failed due to the enemy's strong defenses and fierce artillery fire. After entering summer, the green gauze tent rose, and the Japanese guards along the South Manchurian, Yingkou-Jinzhou, and Fengtian lines were all killed or scattered by Zhanjiu's troops. From Shenyang in the north to Yingkou in the south, Panshan in the west, and Fengcheng in the southeast, there were no traces of the Japanese army within the borders of the counties. After the Mid-Autumn Festival, the people successively harvested their crops. Except for the mountainous areas, which could be used for concealment and defense, there were no long objects in the wilderness, and enemy reconnaissance was extremely easy, making it inconvenient to advance. In addition, the Tanggu Ceasefire Agreement was signed, and the Japanese puppet army deployed an additional four divisions of reinforcements. It could be predicted that a lonely army that had been fighting hard for more than two years, without any supplies, could not withstand the newly built enemy. Therefore, they temporarily abandoned the areas won through bloody battles and retreated to the mountains and forests to await an opportunity.</p>
<h3>Latent Strength</h3>
<p>Zhang Haitian's troops (now led by Zhang Zi (Little Beifeng) with more than 4,000 people are currently lurking in the mountains near □□ County. Lu Shijie's troops with more than 3,000 people are currently lurking along the coast of □□. Deng Tiemei's troops with more than 10,000 people are currently defending the mountains between □□□ and □□. The entire army of the exhausted army is now retreating to the Liaodong □□ area. After the exhausted army retreated, the troops were reorganized, the old and weak were eliminated, and the elite were selected to form four brigades, totaling more than 16,000 people, with complete firearms and more than 8,000 war horses. We also recruited patriotic volunteers and young soldiers from all sides for strict training, hoping to become an elite force.</p>
<h3>The Reality of the Puppet State</h3>
<p>Under the control of the Japanese invaders, the puppet state, although nominally occupying four provinces, can only effectively implement its policies in the cities and towns along the railway line. The remote counties and villages far from the railway are beyond the reach of the puppet state's power. The first step in the puppet state's political facilities is to force people to plant opium, promote open gambling, and collect heavy taxes to prolong their lives. In all the cities and towns where the Japanese and puppet forces can reach, opium dens and gambling houses are lined up, and the owners of the opium dens and gambling houses are all run by the Japanese. It is dark and unbearable to speak of. The reason why the Japanese are doing their best to force people to indulge in opium and gambling is purely to anesthetize the people of the Northeast, wear away their rationality, and block their self-improvement hearts. The Japanese invaders also installed telephones in the towns under their jurisdiction and used local tyrants and gentry to serve as scouts to prevent righteous armies from detecting public sentiment. The contemptible means are infuriating. Wherever our army arrives, we first ban opium and gambling, destroy the transportation network of the exhausted people, and start anew with the people. This is enough to show that the hearts of the people in the Northeast are not dead, and it is also the main reason why our army can support for two years. The puppet state now has 150,000 national defense troops. Those in Liaoning and Ning are the units of Yu Zhishan and Wang Dianzhong, those in Jilin are the units of Yu Xianzhou and Ji Xing, those in Heilongjiang are the units of Zhang Wen□ and Sun □cang, and those in Rehe are the units of Zhang Haipeng. Each army is monitored and commanded by the Japanese. All soldiers usually do not fire a single bullet, and are only issued by name when they are about to go into battle, because the Japanese invaders have never trusted the puppet army, fearing that the puppet army will revolt, and the defense is meticulous. However, under these circumstances, the puppet army's heart of revolt has not been completely eliminated. For example, recently, Zhang Xudong, the company commander of the machine gun company of Yu Zhishan, led the entire company to revolt and joined the Line Army, which is one example.</p>
<h3>Future Aspirations</h3>
<p>Zhan Yuan and others feel that the national atmosphere is very depressed after entering the customs. The previous patriotic upsurge has suddenly subsided. It must be known that the four northeastern provinces are the lifeline of the Republic of China, and how can we bear to see them being slaughtered and not feel pain in our hearts? There is no greater mourning than a dead heart, blood and tears are exhausted, what more can be said? Looking at the small and weak Turkey, there is still a Kemal who restored the country. The vast China does not have a Napoleon who will revive the country. Zhanjiu and others are confident that the government officials are experienced and deliberate in their plans, and work diligently day and night, and the plan to recover the lost land must have been carefully planned long ago. Moreover, the people of the Northeast and the soldiers of the puppet army are unwilling to be oppressed and hope that the government will send troops to recover the lost land, like a great drought hoping for a blessing. It is especially hoped that the people of the whole country will revitalize the spirit of self-improvement, eradicate the concept of temporary peace, unite from top to bottom, and never yield until death, as a backing for diplomacy and as a preparation for counterattack. Furthermore, we should use our remaining strength to assist the righteous army outside the customs, so that patriotic volunteers are not eliminated by the enemy. Once the Japanese-Russian war breaks out, our army can leave the Great Wall and defeat the strong enemy. The righteous army outside the customs can also disrupt the enemy's rear, supporting each other, destroying the Japanese-puppet transportation. The puppet army will be able to respond to the news, and the lost land will be recovered. This is just a matter of advice. I only hope that the people of the country will devote their loyalty and wisdom, destroy their families to relieve the nation's difficulties, and the survival of the country and the nation is at stake. Zhanjiu and others are committed to the country and determined to resist Japan. We will temporarily continue to work hard to repay the people of the country.</p>
<h3>Harbor Quarantine Station's Fourth Anniversary Banquet Last Night: Wu Lien-teh Details Quarantine Work</h3>
<p>The Harbor Quarantine Station held its fourth-anniversary banquet at the East Asia Restaurant last night at 7 p.m. Over a hundred guests attended, including Liu Ruiheng, Director of the National Health Administration; Liu Hongsheng, General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company; Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce; Yuan Lidun; Li Ting'an; Dong Xian Guang; and representatives from various foreign consulates. They were warmly received by Dr. Wu Lien-teh, Director of the station, and others. During the banquet, Director Liu Ruiheng of the Health Administration gave a speech, followed by Dr. Wu Lien-teh, who detailed the station's work and current situation. Finally, Dr. Parker and Mr. Brown delivered speeches. The guests and hosts parted joyfully around 10 p.m. The following is a record of Dr. Wu Lien-teh's speech:</p>
<p>It is a great honor to have you esteemed guests grace us with your presence today. Despite your busy schedules, you have taken the time to attend, which encourages us in the progress of our station. All our work relies on the assistance and guidance of various parties; otherwise, we would not be able to make any progress. Regarding the representatives of the League of Nations present tonight, I would like to express my gratitude on behalf of our station. Without the assistance of the Health Section of the League of Nations over the past four years, our station would not have achieved such results. In particular, Dr. Rajchman, the Director of the Health Section of the League of Nations, has contributed greatly. I not only thank him but also take this opportunity to congratulate him on his new appointment as the League of Nations' representative for technical cooperation and advisor to the National Economic Council. Not only will our country benefit from this, but the world's economic future will also shine brightly. The cooperation between the League of Nations Health Section and our station has been further enhanced through the liaison of the Eastern Bureau of the Health Section in Singapore. Tonight, Dr. Parker, the Director of the Bureau, is also present. I would like to express my gratitude to him. Since taking office, he has been greatly concerned about the progress of our station and has provided full assistance. Before reporting on our work, I still have a point to clarify: Sir Frederick Maze, Inspector General of Customs, various foreign consuls, the Public Health Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the French Municipal Council Health Department, the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, the Lister Institute, and leaders of the shipping industry have all provided our station with utmost convenience and cooperation. Our station's ability to fulfill its duties depends on the enthusiastic assistance of various public and private organizations in this city. As the scope of our duties expands daily, this mutual assistance will continue to advance without end. Now, I will briefly describe the general situation of our work this year.</p>
<p>Rat and Flea Research: I have heard people say that harbor quarantine is not an important task, and some even claim that its only effect is to delay the reunion of long-separated couples. There is no need to argue with such misunderstandings. Now, please allow me to discuss one of the most important parts of our station's work, which is the inspection of rats and rat fleas in Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, Xiamen, and Guangzhou. The purpose of this research is twofold: first, we want to obtain a reliable basis for the types of rats and their parasites in the above-mentioned ports; second, based on this basis, we can seek the interrelationship of plague transmission, as this disease often has the potential to invade with cargo ships. At the end of the 19th century, it invaded our country from India, then entered Taiwan and Japan. Therefore, Shantou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and other ports were all invaded, except for Shanghai and the Yangtze River basin. However, on October 30, 1908, a Chinese person in Hankou was found to have contracted plague. This person originally resided in Shanghai. Since then, Shanghai has occasionally experienced rat plagues and mild epidemics. Therefore, under the guidance of the Chief Medical Officer of our station, we are engaged in this rat and flea research. The results obtained in the future are quite noteworthy. Over the past two years, a total of 2,000 rats have been inspected, all captured along the coast. Senopyila Cheoprs rat fleas are the best vectors for transmitting plague. According to the inspection, these plague fleas are only more numerous in late summer and autumn, with an index below one. It is not yet known whether the numbers obtained in the port area are consistent with those obtained in the urban area. In the near future, we plan to expand the scope of inspection to residential and commercial areas. The results obtained from inspections in other ports are significantly different compared to this city. Plague fleas breed throughout the year. Almost all the rat fleas obtained in Guangzhou and Xiamen are plague fleas. I must thank the owners of wharves and warehouses for allowing us to continue catching rats inside.</p>
<h3>Cholera Situation</h3>
<p>In the past few years, our station has become a general liaison organization because it is in charge of the Shanghai Temporary Cholera Prevention Office. Regarding cholera, we are now striving to carry out various chemical experiments and research in order to eradicate this evil epidemic completely. Last year, more than 4,000 people in this city suffered from cholera, but this year, there has been not a single case. Nationwide, there were approximately 100,000 patients last year, but only six this summer. At next year's anniversary banquet, I may be able to report on the results of our research. Although no true cholera cases have been found in this city this summer, there are still cases of dysentery, typhoid fever, and watery diarrhea. According to reports from the Public Health Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, there have been 28 cases of false cholera and watery diarrhea, and 485 cases of gastroenteritis.</p>
<h3>Ship Inspection</h3>
<p>The work of this section is quite difficult due to misunderstandings from the outside. When various ships enter from epidemic ports, quarantine work is very important, and it is inevitable that this will cause disturbance. I would like to tell the shipping industry that our station is not adopting any new policies, but only knows how to comply with international regulations, actively prevent the spread of quarantinable diseases, and strive to avoid hindering the shipping industry. Due to the global recession, the number of ships entering this city and other ports has decreased sharply. Fewer ships have been inspected than last year, but the total tonnage is almost the same. This year, no smallpox or cholera epidemics have been found in the coastal ports along the river, so the number of inspections has also decreased accordingly. In the ten months of 1933, a total of 1,954 ships were inspected, with a total tonnage of 12,552,579. During the same period last year, there were 1,969 ships, with a total tonnage of 12,576,414. By nationality, this year's inspections include 602 British ships, accounting for 32.5% (total tonnage 4,579,174); 628 Japanese ships, accounting for 32.9% (total tonnage 3,074,120); and 208 American ships, accounting for 11.3% (total tonnage 2,229,000). There were 111 Norwegian ships, 87 German ships, 50 Danish ships, 34 French ships, 35 Chinese ships, 32 Dutch ships, 20 Italian ships, 12 Swedish ships, 6 Panamanian ships, 4 Chilean ships, 5 Greek ships, and 13 Soviet ships. The inspectors at our station have very harmonious relationships with the crew members of various ships, which I am very fortunate for.</p>
<h3>Ship Fumigation</h3>
<p>In order to comply with the International Health Convention promulgated in 1926, the fumigation department of our station has fumigated a large number of ships this year, including ocean liners, cargo ships, river and sea vessels, and barges. We have also made every effort to guide rat prevention methods. The number of fumigated ships is listed below:</p>
<p>January to October 1933: A total of 646 ships were fumigated, with a hold tonnage of 1,387,134.</p>
<p>January to October 1934: A total of 720 ships were fumigated, with a hold tonnage of 1,584,123.</p>
<p>January to October 1933: 105 ocean liners were fumigated.</p>
<p>January to October 1934: 123 ocean liners were fumigated.</p>
<p>January to October 1933: 541 river and sea vessels were fumigated.</p>
<p>January to October 1934: 597 river and sea vessels were fumigated.</p>
<p>January to October 1933: 107 cargo ships were fumigated with carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>January to October 1934: 130 cargo ships were fumigated with carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>January to October 1933: 537 empty ships were fumigated with sulfur.</p>
<p>January to October 1934: 589 empty ships were fumigated with sulfur.</p>
<p>January to October 1933: 2 ships were fumigated with hydrocyanic acid.</p>
<p>January to October 1934: 1 ship was fumigated with hydrocyanic acid.</p>
<p>January to October 1933: 7 Rat Exemption Certificates were issued.</p>
<p>January to October 1934: 10 Rat Exemption Certificates were issued.</p>
<p>January to October 1933: 1,981 rats were fumigated to death.</p>
<p>January to October 1934: 2,276 rats were fumigated to death. No plague germs were found in any of them.</p>
<p>Medical Work: Due to the preparation for cholera and the occurrence of quarantinable diseases, our team's medical work, in addition to vaccinations and injections, is not very tense. After the Sino-Japanese War last year, the Wusong Clinic has been reopened. In the ten months of this year, a total of 1,220 people have been vaccinated by our station, including 426 travelers to Java and 279 French sailors going to Saigon. A total of 337 people from ship companies, dock workers, and sailors have been vaccinated against cholera.</p>
<p>Overview of Branch Offices: At the last anniversary banquet, I gave a brief report on the work of the quarantine branch offices in various ports. Now, please allow me to briefly describe the achievements of the Xiamen branch office, as it is the most important branch office besides the Shanghai branch office. Before January 1931, the quarantine work of the branch office was undertaken by private doctors hired by the Customs, and fees were charged for vaccinating outbound immigrants and inspecting inbound ships. However, there was no hospital to accommodate patients. After we took over, the local authorities allocated a large piece of coastal public land, and we immediately started building an isolation hospital. In the winter of that year, the hospital was completed. At the same time, there was a major smallpox epidemic, and many patients were admitted. Last year, when cholera was prevalent nationwide, the hospital's work was quite tense. A total of 20,000 people were vaccinated. Among the 197 patients treated, 49 died. There was an existing immigrant office in the port, but the location was poor, so it was decided to rebuild a new office and a first-class ward. The new building was funded by the vaccination and inspection fees previously collected. On September 30 of this year, I personally went to the Eastbound opening ceremony. Local officials, foreign consuls, and people from the shipping industry attended. The British Consul also handed over a check for over 8,000 yuan, which was the remaining donation from the old immigrant office. I must express my gratitude to the enthusiastic assistance of various Chinese and foreign parties. The work of the branch offices in North China has been somewhat difficult due to the situation, but they are still working hard according to the original plan. The fumigation work in Hankou has made good progress, and it has now been decided to slightly expand the scope of the branch office's work in that port. From the above brief report, it can be seen that I attach great importance to research and investigation. Medicine, like other sciences, is not static and unchanging. Regarding the prevention of epidemics from entering various ports, we pay considerable attention to various preventive issues related to our country and other countries. We sincerely hope that in a few years, we will be able to make further progress in solving the problem of epidemic outbreaks.</p>
<h3>Disaster Relief Bonds Drawn for Principal Redemption Yesterday Morning: One Lot of Bonds Worth 300,000 Silver Dollars Drawn, Payment to Begin on the 30th of This Month</h3>

<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>After the ceremony, the chairman reported, saying that today is the day for the seventh principal redemption drawing of the first series of disaster relief bonds issued in the 20th year of the Republic of China.

<h3>Dispute Over Transportation of Domestic Goods to Fujian: Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Mediates Yesterday</h3>
<p>Both Parties Express Satisfaction and Acceptance</p>
<p>The dispute between the Shanghai China National Products Sales Cooperation Association and the Fujian gang Sanshan Guildhall over the transportation of goods to Fujian has been reported in the newspapers. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce believes that the occurrence of this incident is very unfortunate for the future of domestic goods and should be resolved peacefully as soon as possible. Therefore, at 2 p.m. yesterday, it invited representatives from both parties, as well as representatives from the shipping and customs brokerage trade associations, to a meeting to discuss a solution. Attendees included Wang Xiaolai and Lu Wenshao, representatives from the General Chamber of Commerce; Yao Zilun, Huang Renwu, Chen Runnan, and Huang Jiaxiang, representatives from the Sanshan Guildhall; Du Chongyuan, Lu Qiant, and Gui Yanfang, representatives from the China National Products Sales Cooperation Association; Yu Shunmao and Chen Xiangxiong, representatives from the Shipping Association; Shi Zhikun, representative from the Customs Brokerage Association; and Chen Jinchen, Zhou Zongren, and Lei Nai'er, representatives from the Jiangxi and Northern Fujian Business Associations in Shanghai, totaling 15 people. Wang Xiaolai, as chairman, first reported the purpose of the meeting, stating that the power of domestic goods is only in its infancy, and in any case, one party cannot dominate the overall situation. Even in terms of business relations, both parties can discuss mutually beneficial methods. It is essential to avoid harming each other and allowing foreign goods to extend their power. Chinese shipping companies should treat domestic products equally and support each other. Relationships based on personal feelings should not be used to favor one side over another. Now, more merchants who run domestic goods, the country will have less profit outflow, we are of the same root, please do not push too hard. Subsequently, representatives from all parties expressed their opinions one after another. Then, the representative of the Sanshan Guildhall proposed three requirements to resolve the case: (1) In the future, if the Sanshan Guildhall finds that the goods transported to Fujian are not domestic products, the National Products Sales Association can notify the Guildhall to handle the matter; (2) The National Products Sales Association shall not engage in contracting activities with manufacturers in Shanghai; (3) The National Products Sales Association shall only fulfill its role of introduction and shall not set up public sales offices in Fujian again. After the chairman's efforts to mediate, the association's representatives denied the second and third requests on the spot, and they were no longer a problem. It was decided that in order to avoid conflicts in business operations in the future, the association will give priority to the Sanshan Guildhall's customers for goods transported to Fujian, and the Sanshan Guildhall will no longer interfere with the association's domestic goods transported to Fujian. If the people of Fujian later establish a domestic goods company on their own, it will not involve the association. After the chairman persuaded both parties with this plan, they both expressed satisfaction and acceptance. The meeting adjourned at 4:30 p.m.</p>
<h3>Zheng Quanzhong from Fujian Urges the Sanshan Guildhall to Cooperate with the National Products Introduction Office</h3>
<p>Zheng Quan telegraphed, saying, "Shanghai Sanshan Guildhall, Fujian business firms, Fuzhou General Chamber of Commerce, and all business firms are hereby notified that reports indicate that the Shanghai Fujian gang, due to the National Products Introduction Office's efforts to transport domestic goods to Fujian for sale at low prices, which they consider to be detrimental to their business, have agreed with various shipping companies to refuse to transport domestic goods. This is deeply shocking. Promoting domestic goods is the only way for the people to save the country. Is Fujian going to reject domestic goods and be a dumping ground for foreign and enemy goods? If the country is gone, what business will there be? By only caring about current business and ignoring the disaster of national subjugation in the future, what kind of people will the country see us Fujianese merchants as? The patriotism of the Fujianese people is especially strong, as recorded in history. Please do not let the legacy of Zheng Chenggong and the martyrs of Huanghuagang be ruined by us. Please change your ways and work with the National Products Introduction Office to promote domestic goods. Sell off the accumulated foreign goods. In the future, unless there are no domestic goods to replace them, we must only sell domestic goods. Welcome domestic goods, everyone feels the same. Selling domestic goods exclusively will surely receive enthusiastic support from the people, and business will definitely develop abnormally. Conversely, if the people hate you, unexpected losses will be unpredictable. How can those who are cursed by everyone survive? The telegraphed tears cry, not knowing the turning clouds, Zheng Quan, trapped."</p>

<h3>Relief Appeal from the Fujian Disaster Area Relief Association – Reception for the Press Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Fujian Disaster Area Relief Association yesterday hosted a reception for newspaper reporters, with over twenty reporters from various newspaper offices attending. The chairman, Gan Ji Gong, presided over the event. During the gathering, the chief of general affairs, Xie Yinpo, stood up and delivered a report, stating approximately: “Today, we members of the association are honored to have all the gentlemen from the press present to provide guidance, for which we are extremely grateful. The rampant spread of the Red disaster in Fujian originated five years ago. At that time, it was confined to a part of western Fujian, the den of the Red bandits Zhu De and Mao Zedong. Their strength was originally extremely fragile, but due to the local authorities’ lack of attention, it was allowed to spread. Gradually, their fierce flames grew and engulfed western Fujian. Once they had fully developed their power, they proceeded to disturb Jiangxi, leading to the nationwide catastrophe we face today. It is extremely heartbreaking to speak of this. Last year, the Red bandits attacked and captured Zhangzhou, and the central government dispatched the 19th Route Army to aid Fujian. However, the bandits retreated before the army arrived, maintaining a small-scale balance of power for nearly a year. Recently, the highest military authorities encircled and suppressed the bandits, while simultaneously blockading food supplies in the bandit-controlled areas. Unable to succeed, the bandit leaders, including Peng Dehuai, launched a full-scale invasion of Fujian. Their advance was quite sharp. In the battles of Liancheng and Qingliu, the garrison troops were ultimately defeated due to a significant disparity in numbers. The bandit army then seized the opportunity to attack Yanping and probe Youxi, threatening to approach the Fujian capital. Fortunately, the 56th Division heroically defended Jiang Le and Shunchang with their isolated forces. They held out for fifty days, running out of ammunition and food. The defense of Shunchang by Tang Tu Chang, in particular, deserves our commendation. It is said that the number of bandits involved in this rebellion exceeded ten thousand, while Tang's troops were outnumbered ten to one. Upon the arrival of the bandits, they immediately closed the city and defended it to the death. When the rice in the city ran out, they replaced it with flour. When the flour ran out, they replaced it</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>with dried bamboo shoots. The military and civilians shared these equally, uniting as one. Although the Shun army bombarded the city day and night with heavy artillery, the officers and soldiers across the country swore to fight to the death and remained unmoved. The city ultimately survived. If all our anti-bandit generals could be like Commander Tang, the Red bandits would not be difficult to subdue. As for the Shaxian and Yong’an areas, they were jointly defended by Mao Weisou's and Lu Xingbang's troops. The bandits launched repeated attacks and suffered heavy losses. The bandits in Yanping, realizing that they could not succeed in capturing Shaxian and Yong’an, also withdrew. Simultaneously, the central government's support troops, including those of Guan Tao and Zhou Hunyuan, had already arrived in Fujian, lifting the siege of various counties in northern Fujian. Tracing back, our province has suffered the ravages of the Red bandits for five years. The area affected by the current disaster extends throughout western and northern Fujian. The displacement and migration of disaster victims in various counties, those who have no homes to return to, number over a million. The destruction of houses and fields, and the massacre of men, women, old, and young, are even more countless. The severity of the disaster and the extent of the affected area are no less than those in Jiangxi. Considering the devastation of our homeland and the disaster victims awaiting relief, our fellow countrymen should urgently gather various overseas organizations to establish a disaster relief organization. Just as we were discussing this, Mr. Sa Zhenbing, formerly from Gongsa Township, came to Shanghai from Fujian to raise relief funds. Various hometown associations held a meeting to welcome him. Considering that Mr. Sa has been in charge of Fujian relief efforts for many years and is highly trusted by all sectors of society, it was unanimously decided to initiate the establishment of the Fujian Disaster Area Relief Association, with Lu Gong as the chairman and Chen Shao嬀 and Xu Yungong as the vice-chairmen. A custody committee was also established, with the Zhongnan Bank, Xiamen Bank, Overseas Chinese Bank, Zhongxing Bank, and various guild halls responsible for managing the relief funds. Initially, a large sum of money was raised by the various guild halls to provide emergency relief. Meanwhile, solicitation teams were organized, with groups, businesses, and individuals taking responsibility for fundraising, aiming for collective effort and maximizing contributions. Since the establishment of our association, letters and telegrams reporting disasters have flooded in like snowflakes. To comprehensively plan and understand the actual situation in the disaster area, in addition to issuing survey forms to the Fujian Provincial Government, the Pacification Commissioner’s Office in Fujian, various county governments, county party headquarters, legal entities, and local impartial individuals for them to fill out and return at any time, we are also selecting and dispatching special envoys to the disaster area to conduct investigations as the basis for relief distribution. However, this matter is of great importance, and it is absolutely beyond our capabilities to shoulder this heavy responsibility alone. We hope that people from all walks of life across the country will rise up and provide strong support for our association. Furthermore, as mentioned above, the Fujian bandit disaster affects the entire country. We also believe that the vitality of the region is the vitality of the country. In the future, the reconstruction of the disaster area should also be the responsibility of the government. We hope that the national relief agencies will pay close attention to and assist the disaster situation in Fujian. At the same time, we hope that the press will disclose our association's subsequent measures and the detailed information about the disaster area obtained from various sources in a timely manner, so as to attract the attention of the people of the country and jointly seek a thorough elimination of the communists and disaster relief. This is not only the fortune of Fujian but also the fortune of the entire country.” Finally, Chen Ni and Shangguan Shufang delivered speeches successively. The reception adjourned at four o'clock.</p>
<h3>Resolution of Fishery Construction Disputes</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce Sends Personnel to Mediate and Advise</p>
<p>The collection of fishery construction fees in Jiangsu and Zhejiang has sparked opposition from fish merchants, dragging on for months without resolution. Yesterday, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce specially dispatched Counselor Yu and Secretary Xu, along with the original mediators Yu Qiaqing, Du Yuesheng, and Yu Zuoting, to send letters inviting leaders of the frozen seafood industry, including Liu Yuehua, Zhang Zhenfang, Chen Jiushou, Shen Xianlu, Wang Zuquan, Chen Linfu, Zheng Yunsheng, and Huang Zhensheng, to the Guangdong Chelu Shipping Club for a final mediation. All parties were candid and open. After several hours of consultation, a settlement was reached. The five settlement measures are excerpted below: (1) The fishery construction fee will be collected on behalf of the frozen seafood industry company through persuasion and guidance. (2) The construction fee will not be levied in areas where domestic salted fish, dried seafood, and shellfish are sold, and there will be no detention of goods. (3) The construction fee will be levied on barrel-headed fresh fish at the time of the first entry into the trade. Shanghai will not collect it again. If it is not collected, the Shanghai trade will collect it on behalf. If there are obstacles, the collection office will be notified to handle it. (4) The fishery construction fee will be based on the principle of one percent of the value. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce will provide appropriate guarantees. If there are any changes, the opinion of the guild must be sought first. (5) The fishery construction fees collected on behalf of the Frozen Seafood Industry Guild will be collected and remitted by the guild. If the collection office deems it necessary to audit, it may send personnel to jointly audit the trade association with the guild representatives. Counselor Yu of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce also verbally acknowledged that frozen seafood businesses could appoint representatives to participate in the management of the fishery construction fee.</p>

<h3>Inventory of Ancient Artifacts from the Palace Museum Stored in Shanghai Completed</h3>
<p>After Yi Peiji, the director of the Palace Museum, resigned due to illness, he returned to Peiping to meet with the acting director, Ma Heng, to handle the handover.

<h3>Father Ki Talks About His Impressions of Traveling in Europe and India</h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that Father Ki, director of meteorology and seismology at the Xujiahui Observatory, recently traveled in Europe and has returned to Shanghai. Yesterday (the 9th), he discussed the results of this trip with a reporter from the North-China Daily News. He stated that he had three tasks for this trip: First, to attend the International Congress of Soil Science held in Lisbon, Portugal from September 17th to 24th. He presented three papers on earthquakes at the conference and also participated in the meteorological and geodetic sections of the conference. Second, to attend the International Maritime Meteorological Conference held in Utrecht, Netherlands, where he accomplished several important tasks. He proposed adding new signals for reporting severe weather during the day when hurricanes move along the Chinese coast. This new signal was proposed at the request of the new climate warning office that the Xujiahui Observatory will be opening. This office was requested by the Chinese government's Ministry of Industry to facilitate Chinese fishermen. Other observatories along the coasts of China and Vietnam naturally agreed. However, this new signal will only be used north of Hong Kong, as the low pressure systems that Shanghai often experiences are rare in Hong Kong and Vietnam. Third, to visit many climate and aviation offices in Europe to improve the affairs of the Xujiahui Observatory upon his return.</p>
<h3>Economic Credit Cooperative Opens This Morning – Reception for Reporters Yesterday – General Manager Qiu Hanping Reports on Background and Benefits</h3>
<p>The China Economic Credit Cooperative, initiated by Zhang Shouyong, Qiu Hanping, and others, is scheduled to open at 10 am today. Last night, the cooperative's chairman Zhang Shouyong, general manager Qiu Hanping, and others hosted a reception for the press at the Weiya Restaurant. During the reception, Mr. Qiu Hanping reported on the social background of the cooperative's establishment, the benefits of joining, and the reasons for the high profits. The main points are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Background of Establishment</h3>
<p>Since the Opium War, the import of goods by the great powers has completely collapsed China's inherent production system. At the same time, China's emerging industries have been unable to develop due to their oppression, leading to rural bankruptcy, unemployment, and unbearable suffering for the people. Coping with daily life has become difficult, and intellectuals are suffering from unemployment. Even if they can find a job, they are often unemployed the next day, and it is even more difficult to bear the burden of their families. They are constantly worried about their children's education during their lifetime and the lives of their wives and children after their death. They have no time to consider their spiritual lives. Seeing the suffering of the people today, we are eager to find a way to alleviate it, hence the establishment of this cooperative.</p>
<h3>Membership Procedures</h3>
<p>The membership procedures are very simple. Fill out a membership application form and pay a membership fee of one yuan, which is no different from ordinary social groups. The difference is that members must save a certain amount each month. This monthly saving is the basic obligation of the members. Members must fulfill this obligation to enjoy all rights. The monthly savings for a full share of the fifteen-year term (reaching [missing character] thousand yuan) is only five yuan, saving only seventeen cents a day to subscribe to a full share. There are also one-fifth and three-fifths shares. Those who can save two cents and three cents or ten cents a day can subscribe to one yuan or three yuan per month. There are also five-year and ten-year options to shorten the time. If you save all at once, the procedures are even simpler. The number of shares subscribed can also be increased according to the economic capacity of the subscriber. However, the maximum number of shares that each person can save is limited to five.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Membership</h3>
<p>After joining the cooperative, members have appropriate relief measures for everything from consumption and entertainment to temporary needs, from unemployment and illness to old-age care, and from children's education to their afterlife. Joining this cooperative is equivalent to having a guarantee for life-long life, and important life issues are resolved unexpectedly.</p>
<h3>Reasons for High Profits</h3>
<p>Perhaps there are those who doubt why the cooperative can give its members so many benefits that are not available in ordinary savings insurance. I do not know why the cooperative can give its members so many benefits, the reason is very obvious. First, the purpose of cooperation is to enable members to help themselves and each other. Second, it seeks the direct benefits of members and does not seek benefits for itself. In recent years, savings banks and insurance companies in Shanghai have developed very rapidly and have made great profits. What they pay in compensation is nothing more than using the mutual assistance of the insured, and what they pay in interest dividends is nothing more than using the funds of the savers. Going to save the small change into a bank, the interest earned is minimal. The bank collects this small change, or lends it or invests it, and earns huge profits in one transaction. The nature of cooperatives is different from ordinary banks and companies. They do not seek the interests of themselves and the dividends of shareholders, but seek the direct interests of members. All the interests of the shareholders of savings banks and life insurance companies are attributed to the members themselves. Therefore, the benefits enjoyed by the members are far beyond what ordinary insurance savings can provide. In addition, various entertainment facilities, medical and sports consultants, legal enrollment travel guidance, in the personal economic capacity, can not be done one by one, in the cooperative, it gathers the power of thousands of members to operate it, then the number of personal burden, is negligible, and is not perceived at all.</p>
<h3>Meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committee of the Cotton Cloth Guild – Investigation of the Sales Situation of Products of Various Factories – Decision to Hand Over to the Investigation Section for Consideration</h3>

<h3>Magician Jin Jianfeng Returns to Perform</h3>

He then wandered with him in the South Sea Islands and European and American countries, performing mysterious and great magic, which was deeply praised by the people there. At the end of October, Mr. Jin and dozens of male and female performers returned with praise. It is said that after a short rest, they will arrange a shocking and terrifying drama, the plot of which is bizarre, the actions are terrifying, the surgery is agile, and the scenery is magnificent, which is unprecedented in Shanghai. I heard that a large theater in this port has hired him to perform on stage, and it will be announced soon to give the people of Shanghai a feast for the eyes.</p>
<h3>General Manager of Kangyuan Canning Company Goes to Nanyang for Inspection</h3>
<p>Shanghai Kangyuan Canning Factory is solely owned by Mr. Xiang Kangyuan, and has implemented scientific management methods. In recent years, its business has advanced rapidly, and its products are excellent, enjoying a reputation as a model factory. Its capital started at only 50,000, and now it has exceeded 1 million, which proves that the factory has concentrated talents and perfect organization. Recently, after the merger of the Huayi Canning Factory in Hong Kong, it has increased its share capital and reorganized into a great company. Mr. Hu Wenhu, a great industrialist, has also strongly supported it and invested heavily. Mr. Xiang has great ambitions and seeks further development. Therefore, accompanied by Mr. Huang Puqi, the manager of the company, he took a film camera and publications, etc., and took the Russian Empress liner on the 7th of this month to Hong Kong and Nanyang to promote the actual situation of the company and win the support of overseas Chinese to jointly build a large enterprise that benefits themselves and others, and to conduct on-site inspections of everything in order to seek the improvement of the business.</p>

<h3>Communist Party Assassination Squad Key Suspects Transferred for Trial Pending – Each Suspect Also Committed Major Crimes Within the Concession – Transfer to the Public Safety Bureau Must Await Interrogation and Judgment</h3>
<p>Cantonese Ouyang Zhiguang, Shanxi native Zhang Yushan, Chongming native Yuan Youfang, Cantonese Zhang Dexin, his wife Zhang Chenshi, Xuzhou native Dong Jiquan, Siyang native Cheng Xiangping (also known as Chen Xiangping), were key members of the Communist Party. They organized a "Dog Beating Squad" [slang for hunting traitors], their sole mission being to assassinate Communist Party traitors serving central government agencies. Countless public officials were assassinated by them. Due to their tight organization and swift methods, despite the best efforts of the police, their secrets could not be uncovered. Recently, detectives from the Shanghai Municipal Public Safety Bureau Inspectorate suddenly obtained a lead and, on the 6th of this month, apprehended Cheng Xiangping at the Central Hotel in Xiaodongmen. Under rigorous interrogation, Cheng confessed that Ouyang and the other suspects were hiding at No. 33 Zhongxing Hotel on Hankou Road, No. 40 Longmen Road, and No. 88 Zaideri on North Chengdu Road, all within the Public Concession. Consequently, they cooperated with Chinese and Western detectives from the Lao Zha Police Station and went to the addresses to arrest Ouyang and the other six. Seven handguns, four Mauser pistols, three toxic gas pistols, and over one thousand rounds of ammunition were seized. They were handed over to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. Because the police station still needed to inspect the handguns, the Public Safety Bureau's request for transfer was not granted. Details of this were previously reported in this newspaper. Now, the police station has discovered that the murder of Huang Yonghua, director of the Special Affairs Section of the Public Safety Bureau Inspectorate, and his follower Qian Yongqing, at the New World Company, the assassination of Central Special Commissioner Ma Shaowu in the garden, and the assault on two Public Safety Bureau secret agents at Siwenli on Xin Zha Road, among over ten other cases, were all committed by them. As the crimes all took place within the Public Concession, the police station decided to handle the cases. Consequently, Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the Legal Department of the Public Works Department, filed a public prosecution with the Second Branch of the High Court. For the time being, the only case being prosecuted is the Huang Yonghua case. Yesterday morning, Yu Hua, the head of the Criminal Division of the High Court, along with assessors Zhao and Zhou, held a continued trial in Criminal Court One. The Public Safety Bureau was also represented by its legal advisor, lawyer Zhan Jifeng. The defendants also retained lawyers such as Zhang Ding to represent them. Judge Yu began by stating that the Public Safety Bureau had initially requested the transfer of the case, and therefore this issue should be resolved first. Lawyer Zhan immediately stated that the defendants were apprehended based on Cheng Xiangping's confession, and therefore requested their transfer. Police lawyer Li stated that the Public Works Department had initially agreed to the transfer, but after discovering major crimes committed within the Concession, it was now arguing that the High Court should first try the cases within the Concession before transferring them. Lawyer Zhan then stated that since the defendants had committed major crimes in the Concession, the High Court could proceed with those cases first, but the Public Safety Bureau still needed to investigate their headquarters. The defendants' lawyers also expressed opposition to the transfer. After deliberation, the court ruled that the police station had already filed charges against the defendants, and the transfer would be considered after the trial was concluded. After the ruling, police lawyer Li stated that Cheng Xiangping was also implicated in the crimes within the Concession and asked if the Public Safety Bureau could be ordered to hand her over for prosecution as well. Lawyer Zhan stated that if Cheng was indeed involved, the police station could discuss the matter with the Public Safety Bureau, and it would certainly be possible to hand her over. The court considered the transfer issue to be resolved, but as the defendants were not all present, proceedings could not continue and adjourned the trial for two weeks.</p>

<h3>"Grass-Flying" King of Flower Gambling Arrested – Flower Gambling Charts Seized – Both Person and Evidence Transferred to General Bureau</h3>
<p>Song Deming, the famous "Grass-Flying" King of Flower Gambling in the Yanpu area of ​​Pudong, was arrested. Because he secretly set up flower gambling listening posts everywhere and moved around unpredictably, the Public Security Bureau had repeatedly attempted to arrest him but failed. As a result, the name "Grass-Flying" became increasingly well-known. Unexpectedly, at midnight the night before last, District Chief Zhang received a report that Song was currently checking accounts inside the agency. He immediately dispatched police chiefs Zhang Zifang, Liu Dezhong, Li Dianming, and others in plain clothes, stormed into his place, and found Song writing and stamping flower gambling charts on the spot. Both the person and the evidence were seized and taken to the Third District before being transferred to the General Bureau.

<h3>Infant Suffocated While Breastfeeding – Whether Liu Tangshi Was Negligent Still Under Investigation</h3>
<p>Tang Bonian, a native of Hunan, 37 years old, is currently a secretary in the Finance Bureau of Beiping Municipality. His family resides at No. 219 Rue Sapore in the French Concession, Shanghai. His wife, née Yang, is of the same age and also from Hunan. They have lived in Shanghai and had four children, two of whom died young. On the 12th of last month, they had their fifth child, a boy named Youzhi. Because the mother was ill, they hired Liu Tangshi, a young woman from Yangzhou (21 years old), as a wet nurse. Only after a doctor certified that her milk was suitable was she hired at a monthly wage of nine yuan. At the beginning of her employment, Tangshi took care of the child diligently and cautiously, earning the deep appreciation of the master, who paid her four months' wages in advance. Unexpectedly, after receiving her wages, Tangshi's service gradually became indifferent. She paid no attention to the child's feeding times and often disobeyed the master's wishes, causing the master deep concern. However, because she had already been paid four months' wages and because she was physically strong, the master was reluctant to dismiss her. Therefore, the child slept with her grandmother, Tang Shenshi, every night, and Tangshi was only allowed to feed the child every two hours, day and night, to prevent accidents. Unexpectedly, at 11 a.m. on the night of the 9th, Tangshi was asleep when Tang's grandmother woke her up and handed her the child to feed. The grandmother went downstairs to eat congee. About fifty minutes later, after finishing her meal, she was about to take the child back from Tangshi to sleep together when she discovered that Tangshi was already fast asleep and that the child had been suffocated by her breast. When questioned, Tangshi refused to admit fault. She was immediately reported to the French police station, who dispatched detectives to arrest her. The child's body was taken to the Tongren Fu Yuan Joint Tang autopsy room. Yesterday, the Second Special District Local Court was notified, and the prosecutor arrived to examine the body. After examining the corpse and questioning the relatives, Tang Shenshi, and the accused, Liu Tangshi, the court ruled that the infant Tang Youzhi died of suffocation before death. The body was handed over to the relatives, Tang Shenshi, for burial. Whether the defendant Liu Tangshi was negligent in breastfeeding or caused the death of the child should be investigated and tried by the police department.</p>
<h3>Sang Yutang and Yu Jiesheng Successfully Invent and Manufacture Security Door Viewer – A Glorious Contribution to National Products – A Necessity for Modern Society</h3>
<p>Sang Yutang and Yu Jiesheng, well-known figures in the industrial world, have long been interested in studying various machines and are deeply skilled in the art. Whenever new and ingenious machines are invented, they explore their principles and structural forms without tiring. Sang and Yu believed that Shanghai was a hotbed for bandits, kidnappings, and ransoms, and the lives and property of the wealthy were often threatened. For the safety of homes and residences, they spent more than a year researching and inventing a security door viewer. They have now established a factory and successfully manufactured it, and it will soon be launched on the market. The product has been approved and registered with the Social Bureau and the Trademark Bureau. It is predicted that after this door viewer is marketed, all companies, shops, and residences will be able to avoid accidental losses, making it the only tool for security. The construction of the door viewer utilizes optical principles, and its effectiveness is such that after installation on the door, everything outside the door can be seen from inside the door with exceptional clarity. Even if someone is hiding in the corner of the door, they will have nowhere to hide. However, from outside the door, nothing inside can be seen. It is truly a scientific weapon for preventing theft and protecting oneself. For the sake of the development of domestic industrial products, Sang and Yu have specially distributed the first batch of products to well-known figures in all walks of life and installed them for them. All have expressed great appreciation and have vigorously supported and promoted the popularization of this ingenious domestic product in society. The company's distribution office is located at No. 551, 5th Floor, South Building, Continental Department Store, Nanjing Road, Shanghai. The price is six yuan per unit, and installation is free. It is said that the company will officially open for business on the 15th. A free beautiful velvet lens cleaning cloth will be given with each door viewer purchased. Wholesale and retail are both welcome.</p>
<h3>Woman Murdered in a Small Inn – A Large Man and an Old Man – Are the Murderers in This Case</h3>
<p>At 7:15 last night, a woman was murdered in a small inn on Rue Hennequin in the French Concession. The two murderers escaped without a trace. The following is a record of the events that transpired.</p>
<h3>Large Man Rents a Room</h3>
<p>A large man suddenly arrived at the Rong'an Inn at No. 34 Rue Hennequin in the French Concession. He claimed to be Shen A'er, 38 years old, a local. He rented Room No. 5, a pavilion room on the third floor, paying six jiao, small silver coins, for one night's room fee. After completing the transaction, the large man hurriedly left again.</p>
<h3>Tragedy Occurs in a Blink</h3>
<p>After leaving, the large man returned fifteen minutes later, leading an old man and a middle-aged woman in tattered clothes. Shen claimed that the woman, née He, was 40 years old. The three entered the room. The tea boy made tea and then went downstairs. Since there were three people, he did not suspect anything. But unexpectedly, a tragedy occurred in a blink of an eye.</p>
<h3>Two Men Leave One After Another</h3>
<p>About half an hour after the tea boy went downstairs, the old man left first, followed by Shen a few minutes later. No one paid attention at the time. After a long time, the two did not return. Then the tea boy, Wang A'ru (36 years old, from Ningbo), went upstairs on business. When he passed Room No. 5 in the pavilion, he saw no movement inside the room, and the door was half open, not bolted. So he pushed the door open.</p>
<h3>Woman Already Tragically Dead</h3>
<p>When tea boy Wang A'ru pushed open the door, he saw the curtains were drawn and there was no response when he called out. Sensing something was wrong, he lifted the curtains and suddenly saw the woman who had entered the room earlier lying face up on the bed, the bedclothes covered in blood, her hands and feet tightly bound with hemp rope, and a knife inserted in her throat. Feeling her, he found that she was already dead. The tea boy was terrified and rushed to tell the innkeeper, Wang Mao Mao, who reported it to the police station. The head of the police station immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. The body was carried to the Tongren Fu Yuan Hall autopsy room, and the Second Special District was notified for examination.</p>
<h3>Lieutenant Hall Sentenced – Sentenced to Two Years and Six Months in Prison</h3>
<p>According to the American Evening Post, American aviator Lieutenant Hall was sentenced to two years and six months in prison this morning (the 10th) by American Judge Pandy for defrauding General He Guoguo of 9,775 yuan intended for purchasing handguns. It is reported that when the trial began last Friday, Hall admitted his guilt but claimed that the money was given to a German arms dealer who was a private merchant and he had a receipt at the time. He also stated that the receipt and other documents were detained by Japanese authorities when he was arrested in Moji. However, after the American court asked the American Consul in Kobe to investigate, the Japanese authorities denied detaining any documents. When the trial was reopened today, Hall again admitted that his previous statement about the woman he sent back to the United States being his wife was also a lie, but she was actually his mistress. He gave her 1,240 gold yuan. The two had lived together in China for eighteen months. When he ran out of money, he defrauded General He of the money and sent her back to the United States. Now that the American Judge Pandy has concluded the case, he will go to Hong Kong on the President Taft steamer tomorrow with his clerk, Collin, to open cases in Guangzhou. However, it is heard that there are no major cases in southern China. Judge Pandy and others can still return to Shanghai on the original ship.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Supervising New Ship Commissioners Wu Daming and Shi Gan Scheduled to Sail – Will Leave Shanghai on the 18th of This Month</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company borrowed 400,000 pounds from the British Boxer Indemnity to order four ocean-going vessels from the United Kingdom. The contract has already been sent to the Boxer Indemnity Board of Directors and mailed to London. As the construction of the new vessels has begun in England, the supervising commissioners dispatched by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will be sailing from Shanghai soon. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Four New Vessels Being Built in England</h3>

The specifications regarding the tonnage, dimensions, and deck layout have been drawn up by the company and sent to the Boxer Indemnity Board of Directors and then to London, where the British Boxer Indemnity Commission is commissioning them according to the specifications. The deadline is tight. The vessels must be delivered within one year at most for deployment on the South China route.</p>
<h3>Materials for Two Vessels Purchased in England</h3>
<p>As for the two Yangtze River vessels, because they cannot cross the ocean to China, the policy has been changed to purchase materials in the United Kingdom and ship them to Shanghai, where the hull will be built by the Jiangnan Shipbuilding Factory in this port. The machinery and other components inside the vessels will all be British goods and will be shipped to Shanghai for assembly.

<h3>Ziyou Association Conducting Relief for Street Children – Forming Investigation Groups – Giving Popular Lectures</h3>
<p>The Chinese Youth Association believes that the number of street children has been increasing, begging in the streets, living an unsettled life, dirty and ragged, and prone to laziness. Charitable organizations are unable to accommodate them. If other paths are not opened up to provide relief, they will inevitably become thieves, which is unimaginable for the future of society. In view of this, the association has dispatched personnel to actively investigate and has organized the already investigated street children into groups to carry out work, with regions as units. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Zonal Investigation</h3>
<p>The association has dispatched specialists to investigate street children in various locations, and then form groups, with zones as units, such as the Taikoo Wharf team, the North Railway Station team, the Sichuan Road Bridge team, etc., to investigate separately, in the hope of completing the task as soon as possible, so as to find ways to provide relief and avoid becoming vagrants.</p>
<h3>Causes of Vagrancy</h3>
<p>It was found that among the street children, there were (1) 23 who had been displaced by disasters such as floods, fires, soldiers and bandits, or because their fathers or brothers had committed crimes; (2) 11 who had escaped because they did not study and were beaten by their fathers or brothers; (3) 8 who had escaped because they were apprentices who did not work hard and were beaten by their masters; (4) 13 who had escaped because they had been lured by their peers; (5) 2 who had escaped because they were addicted to gambling and lost money; (6) 40 who were begging because they were poor and had no food or clothing; (7) 3 who were soldiers who had been laid off. Among these 100 people, 69 were willing to enter the association's educational institute, and 31 were willing to remain vagrants for the rest of their lives.</p>
<h3>Providing Education</h3>
<p>The association plans to give the one hundred or so street children popular lectures and entertainment, to cultivate their character, so that they can be subtly influenced and brought back on the right track. However, those who are of good character and have lofty aspirations will be given appropriate education. If they are sick, they will be sent to the association's hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Unemployed Man Commits Suicide Due to Poverty</h3>
<p>Yue Guisheng, a native of Suzhou, 21 years old, used to work as a butcher at the Su-Xi Zaisheng Company at No. 50 North Chengdu Road. Because he was not working hard, he was laid off by his employer. After Yue lost his job, he stayed idle at home. The afternoon before last, at about 4 p.m., Guisheng, because of economic pressure and the difficulty of living, suddenly had the idea of being tired of life. When no one was looking, he swallowed a yuan's worth of raw opium. Later, he was discovered by his family and rushed to the Longhua Hospital. However, because he had been poisoned too deeply and treatment was too late, he died early yesterday morning. His body was sent to the autopsy room for examination.</p>

<h3>Zhongfu Silk Mill Increases Capital and Expands</h3>
<p>The Zhongfu Silk Mill has been operating for nearly ten years. Initially, it was planned to raise 500,000 taels of shares. However, because silk was a newly established industry and few were interested, it opened for business after only half of the shares were collected. In just a few years, the results were significant. In addition to all the additions, repayments of start-up costs, and deposits of new and old public reserves, shareholders were still able to distribute 1.34% of official dividends annually. In addition, boilers and machines were surplus, in order to expand the base for further step-up in Japan, all that was lacking was a spindle. Recently, due to the daily decline in silk prices, it was necessary to increase output and reduce costs to add looms to fundamentally solve the problem. A temporary shareholders meeting was held on the 7th of this month, and it was decided to increase capital by 150,000 yuan. Each share was changed to 100 yuan. Shareholders have enthusiastically subscribed. However, for the sake of promoting interest in investment in industry, it was decided that 150,000 yuan would be taken up by old shares, leaving 100,000 yuan for investment from all sectors, with the aim of sharing benefits equally. It is said that the deadline for payment is the end of the Western calendar year.</p>
<h3>Magnificent Opening of Furen Hospital</h3>
<p>The opening of Furen Hospital on Mintiniyin Road in this port took place the day before yesterday (the 9th). The reporter went at ten o'clock and was personally greeted by Mr. Shen Liuchun, a director of the hospital. The hospital's internal facilities are complete, such as electrotherapy, sun lamps, X-rays, through-flow electricity, steam baths, etc., far superior to ordinary hospitals. Even the ward equipment, from special class to third class, is very clean. Hot and cold water pipes and water radiators, as well as bathrooms, are available. Patients can call the hospital staff not with an electric bell, but with a red light, to avoid noise. This shows the depth of the hospital's intentions. Great doctors Xie Qigang, Zhu Baoliang, and Zhou Jifu are all deeply skilled in medicine and agile in surgery. Those who are poor and sick and seek medical attention and have a reliable guarantee will only be charged a fee to cover food expenses. Over two hundred guests attended, including business tycoons Yu Qiaqing and Sun Meitang. Yuan Ludeng and Fang Jiaobo each presented congratulatory inscriptions. The hospital specially prepared Western pastries to entertain the guests. Everyone was happy and dispersed at around four o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Apprentice Zhu Yusheng Arrested for Absconding with 5,000 Yuan – Bankbook for 4,800 Yuan Seized</h3>
<p>Mao Zhonggang, manager of the Jutai bean and food store at No. 24 Dongjiadu, Nanshi, instructed his apprentice, Zhu Yusheng, 19 years old, from Wusong, on September 12th of this year, to take 5,000 yuan in paper money to deposit at the Huixiangzhuang in Jixiang Lane, French Concession. Unexpectedly, the apprentice Zhu Yusheng had ill intentions, absconded with the money, and never returned. Store manager Mao Zhonggang, knowing that he had absconded with the money, separately reported the case to the Chinese and Concession authorities and requested that a general order for arrest be issued. Lu Ying, captain of the Shanghai Municipal Public Safety Bureau Detective Team, had already issued a general order to all precinct detectives to rigorously investigate and arrest him. Yesterday afternoon, at around 8 p.m., store employee Cui Guanqun went to a rice industry tea party in the North City for business. When he passed the intersection of Wai Xinqiao Street in Jiu Mu Di (Chinese territory), he ran into the apprentice Zhu Yusheng. He immediately stepped forward, shouted for the police, and arrested him, taking him to the First Precinct of the Second District for questioning. After the precinct chief clarified the circumstances, he ordered Inspector Xu and Liu Shaoqing, the detective team leader from the Second District General Office, to lead the criminal Zhu Songqing to the French Concession with Bao Detective Qin Youde from the Songshan Road Patrol Room, to his residence at No. 8 Xixi Lane, Maren Road, Route Lafayette. On the spot, they seized the original stolen bankbook for 4,800 yuan and took it to the Patrol Room. After questioning, they were brought back to the First Precinct of the Second District for questioning. He also confessed that he had gone to Beiping on September 13th to hide, but because he was not used to the food, he returned to Shanghai. He had spent dozens of yuan on travel expenses and paying tuition fees at a certain school. Zhu's guarantor, Jiang Hongbin, was also summoned to the case and briefly questioned. At noon yesterday, they were sent to the Third Section of the General Office for questioning.</p>
<h3>Funeral for Madam Lu Liankui Scheduled – Venue Chosen as the Chinese Merchant Villa</h3>
<p>After the death of Madam Zhang, the beloved wife of Mr. Lu Liankui, inspector of the Public Works Department Police Force in the Public Concession, the dates of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd of December, Western calendar (or the 14th, 15th and 16th of the Lunar calendar) has been set for the wake. Because Mr. Lu has an outstanding reputation and wide-ranging connections, it is expected that many military and government officials, gentry, merchants, and people from all walks of life from this port and other places will come to pay their respects. The old site of the Chinese Merchant Villa on Wenshi Lin Road has been chosen as the ceremonial hall. The building there is very spacious, with five courtyards. The main gate faces Wenshi Lin Road, and the side gate is on Haining Road. The depth and magnificence of the architecture are rarely seen. It is heard that one hall will be arranged as the ceremonial hall, where the portrait of Madam will be worshipped. Because Mr. Lu believed that simply displaying a framed photograph would not be spectacular enough, he decided to have a larger portrait specially made, with its appearance and smile as true to life as possible, so that those who admire her would feel as if her voice and appearance were still present. It is also planned that after the wake, the portrait will be moved back to the native place and placed in the ancestral hall for perpetual remembrance. In recent days, because the Chinese Merchant Villa has been unoccupied for a long time, the interior has been covered in cobwebs and dust. Craftsmen are being hired to repair and clean it thoroughly. As the main gate was not previously opened, it is considered inelegant, so it is waiting for the interior to be cleaned up before the main gate will be repaired. There are only three weeks left until the wake, so there is plenty of time to make preparations. It is expected that the scene of plain carriages and white horses will be even grander than on the day of the funeral.</p>
<h3>Fire at Zhixiang Type Factory</h3>
<p>At nine o'clock in the morning before last, a fire suddenly broke out at the Zhixiang Type Factory at No. 6 Huacheng Road in the French Concession. Flames soared and sparks flew in all directions. Fortunately, the neighbor was the Qingyun Soda Fire Extinguisher Distribution Office. Guo Qingyun, the owner of the office, carried a self-made Qingyun soda fire extinguisher and sprayed it, the foam like mist, and extinguished the fire in a moment. By the time the fire brigade from the Songshan Road fire station arrived, there were no traces of fire. The loss was very small, only burning some boards and several frames of lead type. After the incident, the police department ordered detectives to investigate and summoned the owner of Zhixiang, Mr. Lu, to inquire about the cause of the fire.</p>
<h3>Car Kills Police Officer</h3>
<p>The Rue de Gênes in western Shanghai is located in the Chinese-administered area. The Sixth District Public Security Bureau has set up guard posts there to maintain order. At approximately 5 PM the day before yesterday, a rickshaw puller reported to the nearby guard that a person dressed as a policeman had been run over by a car on Zhongshan Road and was dying. The guard rushed to the scene and found a colleague. Upon closer inspection of the uniform, he was identified as Chu Enxue, a police officer from the Tianbao Lane Police Station of the Fourth District. The guard immediately hired a car to take him to the Red Cross Hospital, but the rescue was ineffective, and he died shortly after. As for the car that caused the accident, the area was sparsely populated, and no one noticed it, so it escaped without a trace. Afterward, the guard reported the incident to the Sixth District Headquarters, which relayed the information to the Tianbao Lane Police Station by telephone. According to the patrol officer, Chu had requested leave that afternoon at 3 PM for personal matters and left, destination unknown. It was deeply regrettable that he was struck by a car and died two hours later.</p>
<h3>Predicting the Great Whale's Travels</h3>
<p>The great whale, weighing 100,800 catties, which was exhibited in Shanghai, has concluded its exhibition after more than six weeks. It is now planned to transport it to Shandong and Hebei provinces, as well as the Tianjin and Beijing areas. The railway car carrying the whale has already been sent to Wusong for repairs so that it can be transported via the Jinpu Railway. The first stop will be Jinan, where it will be displayed for about two weeks, followed by Tianjin and Beijing. Then, it will return to Shanghai, with planned exhibitions in various locations along the Jinpu and Jinghu Railways, totaling about six months. It is understood that the Tai'an Orphanage has obtained the rental rights from the whale's owner to use the exhibition revenue to help the millions of children who have been left homeless by the Yellow River floods. The orphanage has a proven track record of excellent work in the past, and this new method of saving disaster victims will greatly benefit the country.</p>

<h3>Fifth Municipal Elementary School Games Track and Field Competition Reaches Final Stage Today: Too Many Events, Starts Early at 8:30 AM. All Events Conclude Today, Awards Ceremony to be Scheduled</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the second day of the fifth annual municipal elementary school joint sports meet. The weather remained good. All events will conclude today. However, due to the large number of events, the competition will start early at 8:30 AM. All judges, staff, and male and female athletes from each school must arrive on time. The details of yesterday's competition are as follows:</p>
<p>Sports Overview</p>
<h3>Group Exercises</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of fifty-five group exercise routines were performed, such as Bide's shield exercise, depicting the Sino-Japanese War, Shanghai Shangxue's colored flag exercise, with various patterns, Qunshihui's deaf-mute exercise without commands, Tangwan Elementary School's lower grades' "baby soldiers," with their tender legs fully exposed, Youlong's dragon dance with graceful poses, and Lin Yin's character exercise, forming the eight characters "Lin Yin Elementary School Reading to Save the Nation," which was particularly commendable. Other excellent performances included Caotang's freehand exercises, He'an's short stick exercises, and Haozhu's vaulting box performance. The Shanghai Kindergarten's "little workers" and Minzhi's "little farmers" embodied the meaning of production education. Longde's national flag exercise, Tangwan's rice harvesting dance, and Qunxuehui's "little heroes" were particularly interesting.</p>
<h3>Track and Field</h3>
<p>The track and field competition yesterday completed the finals for the men's groups' shot put and the A group's high jump and long jump, as well as the women's A group's 100-meter dash, etc. The men's groups' 100-meter dash has also entered the finals stage. However, no new records have been set in the past two days. Wan Zhu's Zhu Hongqi's long jump result of 5.46 meters in the men's A group was close to the record held by Jia Youliang. The men's A group 800-meter preliminary was originally a highlight, but it started at five o'clock, and it was difficult to see clearly in the twilight. In the men's 100-meter A group final, the results of Xicheng's Hu Kaihou and Shanghai North's Cao Jiabao were close, and there is sure to be intense competition.</p>
<h3>Sidelines</h3>
<h3>The Security Team is Very Busy</h3>
<p>The South District Security Team was very busy on the field, providing service. Outside the sports field, at the students' rest area, many vendors were selling spiced beans and peanuts. Many elementary school students were hungry and scrambling to buy them. However, the sale of goods by vendors was not allowed by the regulations, and the security team members were running around, grabbing one after another, which was quite amusing. The Guanshengyuan food stall was specially permitted to be set up and was not subject to the ban, so business was booming.</p>
<h3>Weigh-in Area: Athletes Disarm</h3>
<p>In the track and field competition, the authorities of each school were eager to win and often did not follow the regulations, with the A group pretending to be the B group, and the B group pretending to be the C group. Especially in the track events, tall people were often found impersonating others to win championships in the C group. The judges did not let their guard down and reweighed them, finding that they all weighed over 80 pounds, and their qualifications were revoked. The weigh-in area was bustling for a while. The elementary school students were very clever, taking off their outerwear and running barefoot at the time of weighing, but the difference was limited, and they still returned disappointed.</p>
<h3>Bizarre Costumes of Kindergarten Students</h3>
<p>The costumes of the kindergarten students from each school were colorful and ingenious. The most aristocratic was the Wanzhu Kindergarten, with costumes made of red and black silk velvet. Xicheng and Shangwen had specially made national wool sweaters from Yansheng Industrial Society, which were also quite modern. The most simple were the Minzhi Kindergarten students performing as "little farmers," wearing blue silk cloth farmer's clothes on the upper body, a homespun apron on the lower body, a bamboo hat on the shoulder, and straw sandals on the feet, looking like real farmers, which was very special.</p>
<h3>Qin Zhixue is a Standard Beauty</h3>
<p>Ms. Qin Zhibao, the physical education instructor at Wanzhu Elementary School, graduated from the Southeast Women's Physical Education College. She has been teaching at Wanzhu for many years and has participated in three elementary school sports meets in a row. Her muscles are fair and firm, with the style of Xu Lai. The crowd calls her a "standard beauty." In the morning, she wore a coffee-colored cheongsam and leather shoes. When she exercised in the afternoon, she changed into a white sports shirt, which was shining brightly, with a line of English characters on the hem. Her thighs were revealed under the short skirt, truly a sports athlete.</p>

<h3>The National Games Closed Many Days Ago, Qinghai Athletes Arrive in Beijing Late: Encountered Rain and Robbery on the Way, Experienced Hardships and Arrived in Beijing Late</h3>
<p>After the closing of the National Games, Qinghai athletes Zhang Shengzhu, Ma Si, Wu Yongtai, Wang Tingzhang, and team leader Zhao Yongjian left for Beijing on the 9th of this month to deliver a report from Ting Xiyao, Director of the Education Department, to the Ministry of Education. It is reported that in addition to the 13 athletes who came to Beijing last time, there are still these five people from Qinghai. Because they set off in two groups, these five people started from Qinghai on September 11. They encountered rain, and the ground was muddy and inconvenient for cars, so they walked on foot. They also encountered bandits and took detours. After experiencing hardships, they arrived in Beijing late today. National Games staff member Liu Yabai accompanied the athletes to visit the Central Sports Field. Guo Lianfeng went to the Ministry of Railways at the request of the athletes to ask for special accommodation for the five people and issue free tickets back to Qinghai.</p>

<h3>Regarding the Sino-German Art Exhibition: The National Art Community Plans to Issue a Statement to the German Government That the Current Works Are Not Representative of Chinese Culture</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 10th Dispatch) Wang Qi, Li Yishi, Liang Dingming and more than ten others, due to the request to postpone the Sino-German Art Exhibition, the government has not made a concrete expression. They plan to jointly send a telegram to the German government on behalf of the national art community, stating that the works carried by Liu Haisu, which are said to be for exhibition, have not been widely solicited or publicly reviewed, and are not sufficient to represent Chinese culture. They are currently seeking co-signatories. (Nanjing, 10th Dispatch) Wang Qi, Liang Dingming, and others believe that the Sino-German Art Exhibition is of great importance to China's cultural standing. They had requested the authorities to publicly solicit submissions and postpone the event. On the 10th, newspapers reported that Liu Haisu was scheduled to take the exhibits to Europe on the 14th. According to Wang Qi's statement to reporters, Liu rashly set off without waiting for the government to resolve the matter. His colleagues are determined not to remain silent and will jointly send a telegram to the German government and publish it in European newspapers, exposing that the exhibits carried by Liu this time have not been publicly solicited or reviewed and are not sufficient to represent Chinese culture.</p>

<h3>"Existing Since Ancient Times" and "Also Existing in Foreign Countries"</h3>
<p>— Nineteen</p>
<p>There are two very common sayings in China now: one is "existing since ancient times," and the other is "also existing in foreign countries." It seems that these are two parallel tracks, and everything either tends to this or tends to that. Therefore, although it is clear that cold pork is no longer fortunate enough to be eaten, the Confucius Temple must still be preserved; otherwise, it would be "cutting off the sage!" This is because the Confucius Temple has "existed since ancient times." "Miss" and Miss, "sorry" and "borrow" (Sorry), are originally one and two, and two and one; however, if you want to say it more beautifully, then Miss should be renamed "Miss," and "sorry" should be changed to "borrow." This is too much because the two terms "Miss" and "borrow" "also exist in foreign countries." A few examples are enough to prove that the two phrases "existing since ancient times" and "also existing in foreign countries" should not be underestimated.</p>
<p>Mencius said: "If a country has no external troubles, it will perish." Correct. This is indeed not only "existing since ancient times" but also "also existing in foreign countries." Ten years of accumulation and ten years of training, Goujian finally conquered Wu. This is "existing since ancient times." In the Franco-Prussian War, France ceded Alsace and Lorraine to Prussia, but in less than fifty years, a great war broke out in Europe, and France was finally able to recover its lost territory in 1918. This is "also existing in foreign countries." Because of this, the country will perish even if it has no external enemies; then, even if the land is lost, everyone can rest assured that it can be recovered in ten or dozens of years, so why worry! When Hu Liefu is mentioned, everyone wants to gnash their teeth; however, "traitors" have "existed since ancient times." Just take the Ming Dynasty: "In June of the sixteenth year of Hongwu, eighteen barbarian ships invaded Xiaohuosai, Jinxiang, and the government troops defeated them. The following year, Hu Weiyong falsely sent Li Wang from Luzhou to act as an envoy to return, and Lin Xian... came with the monk Ruyue to present giant candles containing gunpowder and weapons, plotting rebellion: by the time it arrived, Weiyong was executed, and the court punished his rebellious party, imposing extreme penalties on Xian." See Gu Tinglin's Book on the Benefits and Diseases of the World's Kingdoms, Overseas Barbarians. Hu Weiyong and Lin Xian were both "traitors": isn't this "existing since ancient times"? Therefore, "traitors" should never be made to be.</p>
<p>"Control" is "Control," and "prize coupons" are "Lottery." There are many more foreign fresh terms that are gradually or will be coming in a steady stream. Although this cannot be said to have "existed since ancient times," it "also exists in foreign countries." "Existing since ancient times" is enough to convince people; moreover, since it "also exists in foreign countries," there is naturally nothing more to say.</p>

<p>Chapter 18: Tenderly Passing Tea to Comfort the Husband, Hastily Leaving the Village with a Forced Smile Bidding Farewell to the Family</p>
<p>Even though half of his face was covered, Zhao Ziqiang could still recognize him. He couldn't help but shout, "Isn't that Old Liu from the east end of the street?" Old Liu jumped off the cart, dropped the whip in his hand, and bowed deeply to him with both hands, saying, "Company Commander Zhao, look at this, what should I do? My whole family is counting on my cart and these two animals, running back and forth between the city and Haidian. Now I've brought them all here, what should I do? I thought you didn't recognize me. I wanted to call out to you several times, but I was afraid of committing a crime and didn't dare to call out. It's good that you recognize me. I still have an eighty-year-old mother at home, you know." As he spoke, he simply knelt down and kowtowed to Zhao Ziqiang three times. Zhao Ziqiang saw his eyes rolling, and tears were about to fall. He reached out and helped him up. He was just about to say something and then discuss it further, but when he looked behind him, there were four more large carts that had been pulled over, following closely behind. Naturally, each cart also had a driver sitting on it, all staring at Old Liu with wide eyes. So he hardened his heart and said with a stern face, "You're talking nonsense. If I could let you go, why would I have brought you here? You'll come with us, and it won't be a loss for you. One day of travel, one day of money." Old Liu kowtowed twice and was criticized for talking nonsense. He had no choice but to hold back his tears, stand up, and sit back on the cart to drive. Zhao Ziqiang led the quartermaster and simply rode back to the camp in the five carts. When he walked back to the company headquarters, he ran into Tian Qing, who laughed, "You're better off than me. You went home to see your lover." Zhao Ziqiang didn't say anything and sighed heavily. Tian Qing laughed, "What's wrong? Did your mother-in-law have anything to complain about?" Zhao Ziqiang said, "Ah! That's not it, but..." As he spoke, he took off his military cap with his left hand and stroked his head with his right hand, indicating his hesitant and helpless expression.

<h3>Homesickness and Urban Ailment</h3>
<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>No one can avoid feeling isolated and lonely when first stepping into this city, cursing everything around them, everything that seems to be mocking them. And thinking of home twelve times a day. Indeed, everyone who first steps into this city has this symptom, which is said to be called "homesickness."</p>
<p>"Homesickness" is not an incurable disease, nor is it as serious as "lovesickness," and there is no need to ask a traditional Chinese medicine doctor for a prescription or a Western medicine doctor for an injection. It will not involve life and death. The only treatment is to use your spare time to pursue a place to "relieve your boredom." In the city, places to "relieve your boredom" are more abundant and complete than anything else. Among them, the one that gets the brain rolling and the thumb pointing is naturally the "dance hall." In the dance hall, there are tempting faces and thighs, and intoxicating champagne and beer. Under the obscured bright electric lights, in the jazz sounds that are joyful without being lewd and mournful without being resentful, you will lose your entire soul, and you will be happy here and not think of Shu.</p>
<p>If you don't go to the dance hall, then please go to the cinema to relieve your boredom. Or go to the park, too. In the cinema, in the park, if you are lucky and have a good love star, then women will come after you without you chasing them. Even if you take a hundred steps back, if there are no women chasing you, then there are many opportunities in those places, if you are not Liu Xiahui or a man of Lu.</p>
<p>Amusement parks. Compared to dance halls, cinemas, and parks, they are naturally inferior, but as a place to "relieve your boredom," it is not necessarily a bad place. There, there is also everything that is charming and intoxicating, and the tempting ingredients are relatively stronger. And it is even more of a good medicine for those suffering from homesickness.</p>
<p>To put it more simply and easily, then strolling along a few bustling streets is already interesting enough, and especially at night, on those famous mysterious streets. On those mysterious streets, you can experience "exoticism." If you are interested and step into the coffee shop frequented by decadent Chinese poets, then you may realize what the so-called "southern style" is all about.</p>
<p>These, these, are enough to cure your unshakeable "homesickness," but the incurable "urban ailment" is also beginning to bury your soul in the grave.</p>
<h3>A Record of Mr. Liang from Guangdong</h3>
<p>— Jinzi</p>
<p>First of all, I want to declare that I am a "backward person of the times" who believes in the theory of cause and effect; but even if the times abandon me, the facts that happen before my eyes are pouring over to my way of thinking, and so I grasp the theory of cause and effect more firmly. If you don't believe me, please read below丨</p>
<p>There is a Cantonese person surnamed Liang, whose name will not be published for the time being. However, he works at the Shanghai Two-Road Administration, and it is not difficult to inquire. Although he is already very old, his appetite is very strong. Cantonese people originally like to eat the most, and they like to eat strange things, such as three snakes and rice worms, which people in other places dare not touch, but they love to eat them like their lives. Liang's appetite is even stronger than that of ordinary Cantonese people, and his income is not low, so he is wholeheartedly trying to study eating as much as possible, especially raw turtle meat, which is the most special. Turtle meat is also eaten by many locals, and it goes without saying that Cantonese people eat it even more, but it is probably rare to eat it raw like Liang. The method is to first feed a turtle until it is very fat and full, and then wash it clean with water. Liang then grabs the turtle with one hand and holds a knife with the other. As the knife flashes, the turtle's head falls off at the neck, and Liang turns it upside down and puts his mouth on the turtle's broken neck, sucking its fresh blood with force. At this time, the turtle is not completely dead, and its four legs are desperately moving and scratching outside the shell, just corresponding to the clicking sound coming from Liang's mouth. By the time he has finished sucking the turtle's blood, the turtle's legs are no longer moving. Let's not talk about this for now.</p>
<p>Just say that this spring, rape flower turtles were on the market, and Liang couldn't help but have a strong appetite and wanted to eat a big meal.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, a boil suddenly grew on his own neck, festering unbearably. He asked a doctor to see it, who said it was the most dangerous "carbuncle on the head," and the only way to save it was to have surgery. So Liang was hospitalized for surgery. Unexpectedly, when the doctor made a light cut, his head fell off with the knife. It was cut off at the neck, and fresh blood gushed out, just like the situation he had inflicted on the turtle.</p>
<p>That's how the matter ended.</p>
<h3>Tendency of Film Style</h3>
<p>— Li Jingxian</p>
<p>Although film in our China has only been around for more than ten years, it has undoubtedly become our most powerful weapon.</p>
<p>Its stylistic changes, searching for the traces of its evolution from the transitions, can be found in these: 丨丨</p>
<p>In the beginning, of course, it could not escape the childish elements of "farce" and "hooliganism." Later, some people knew that it could be used to open up people's wisdom. Thus, it was regarded as a work of popularizing civilian education, but the style inevitably had some regrets similar to the method of preaching. Later, the tide of martial arts was like a torrent raging in the silver sea, and unfortunately, the waves of gods and monsters even mixed into the heavy siege of this climax, causing the bright silver sea to be disturbed, causing shadows to become pitch black.</p>
<p>But this shadow soon dissipated its trace, and the tendency of Chinese film style entered a new realm.</p>
<p>This realm is tending towards our masses. It will no longer be a simple entertainment product for people, but will go further to shout, awaken, and awaken this group of lambs who are lost and cannot find a way out for our masses who are trapped in suffering.</p>
<p>It is said that the new film "Iron Plate Red Tears Record" by Mingxing New Film has a picture composed of bold lines. These lines can fully depict the crimes of the past warlords who poisoned the people with exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, and the tense posture of the revolutionary seeds brewing on the eve of the outbreak.</p>
<p>Remember, this stylistic tendency is standing on our side.</p>

<p>Fashion Special Issue, Issue 10</p>
<h3>Farewell to Readers</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>This publication has been published for ten issues since September 9th. In these short two months, we ask ourselves if we have achieved anything significant; but we have at least achieved two goals: first, to promote domestic clothing materials, and second, to popularize clothing. We certainly dare not boast that this fashion special issue has much ability and effect; but we also do not shy away from the fact that in these two months, domestic clothing has indeed become more popular due to the promotion of this publication. Also, although we have also created novel and hygienic styles of clothing, the avoidance of extremely luxurious decorations on cheongsams (popular clothing) and only trimming one side, and the lack of lace on the inside of the robes, etc., have also become very popular. This can reduce the burden of tailoring costs by a considerable amount.</p>
<p>We deeply feel that the clothing expenses in each family are probably 70% to 80% for women; we also believe that if all the ladies understand that domestic clothing materials are so cheap and of good quality, then the annual leak of 300 million yuan of foreign goods can be greatly reduced: at the same time, we also hope that the clothing of the masses should meet the three principles of "economy," "hygiene," and beautification.</p>
<p>Now that the weather is cool, everyone has mostly prepared for winter clothes, so the colleagues want to take advantage of this period to make an end. It is not known whether they will continue to publish in the future if there is another opportunity? At the same time, this publication has reached an agreement with the Meiya Silk Weaving Factory, Zhanghua Woolen Company, Hongxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory, and Hongxiang Clothing Company, that if readers have any questions about clothing, they may write to any one of them and ask in detail, and they will definitely enthusiastically tell you everything you want to know, if the clothing materials are completely domestic.</p>
<h3>This Week's Fashion Changes, Editor's Report</h3>
<p>In this week, we can see in public places that many women's cheongsams are slightly shorter than before. The cheongsams of the past were so long that they dragged on the ground, and the hem was very dirty and would tear. Now, they probably only reach the ankles.</p>
<p>There is a coat style this year that is not only very new but also beautiful. A large pleat is made on the back, and a pleat is made on each side of the chest, and a pleat is also made on the lower left and right parts of the hem, so it is very comfortable to wear.</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. Wang Jingwei said that senior staff should wear mandarin jackets. So men's mandarin jackets are fashionable again, mostly made of domestic black georgette.</p>
<h3>After Returning Home (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Shou Juan</p>
<p>For several days in a row, Madame acted like an inspector on the road, trying to find a Western suit material for her husband everywhere. One evening, she excitedly rushed home with a fairly large bag, gesticulating and saying to her husband, "Okay, okay, I've already gotten you a good material for a suit. You look at it, and I guarantee you'll be satisfied." As she spoke, she opened the bag and held a stack of smooth and lovely suit wools in both hands, sending them straight to Mr. C's eyes. Mr. C first glanced at it casually, and there was already a point of satisfaction on his face. Then he pinched it with two fingers, and there were three points of satisfaction on his face. Then he grabbed a corner of the material and rubbed his hands vigorously against each other. There were suddenly nine points of satisfaction on his face. Finally, he picked up the whole piece and held it in both palms, bouncing it up and down. There were twelve points of satisfaction on his face, and he shouted joyfully, "My love, my love! Where did you buy this material? I think it must be from a famous German factory. No other country can make such authentic goods. I've been looking for it for a long time and couldn't find it, but it just fell into your hands. It really didn't take any effort at all." Madame smiled and said, "I knew you would be satisfied when you saw material like this. I got it from a German friend." Mr. C clapped his hands and cheered, "Isn't that right? Isn't that right? I'm still a German expert. I knew it was German goods at a glance. If I'm wrong, you can just gouge out my eyes." When Madame heard this, she started to giggle and laugh, laughing so hard that she leaned forward and backward, and tears came out. Mr. C hurriedly said, "What are you laughing at? I mean what I say. If I'm wrong, anyone can gouge out my eyes." Madame wiped her tears as she laughed and nodded repeatedly, saying, "Okay, okay, you sit still and don't move. I'll gouge out your eyes." As she spoke, she took a small knife from the table and walked up to Mr. C, but then she suddenly put the knife down, lowered her head, and said with a smile, "Darling, I'm not going to gouge out your eyes. I'm still going to pry open your Western-obsessed mind. You should know that this material is not German goods at all. It's actually a domestic product of your Republic of China." Mr. C said in surprise, "How so? Can we Chinese make such authentic suit wools? No matter what, I can't believe it." Madame said, "If you dare to talk back again, then I will not only gouge out your eyes, but also cut off your tongue. To tell you the truth, this is indeed your domestic product. I bought it from a wool shop on Nanjing Road that makes fashionable dresses with dark brown mei-chang crepe, lotus leaf sleeves with similar cuffs, circular waist openings, and exposed white arms. It is extremely dignified and beautiful for plump people to wear this.</p>
<p>It was bought from a wool shop at the intersection of East Road. According to my partners, it is made by the Zhanghua Woolen Textile Company, called Jin Yangmao brand Zhanghua wool, and the goods are both high-quality and cheap. If you don't believe me, I can accompany you to see it. There are many similar things on display in that shop, and the name of that shop is also called Zhanghua." Mr. C was still unwilling to believe it easily. He carefully looked at the material again, pinched it, rubbed it, and bounced it up and down, saying with surprise and joy, "This is really strange. We hopeless Chinese can make such authentic suit wools. It's both clean and fine, and the color is good, and the texture is firm. It's really comparable to authentic German goods. From now on, I can only be considered a blind person, and I will no longer dare to underestimate any of our domestic goods. And I want to make an oath that from today onwards, I will love China with a hundred and twenty percent sincerity and love our Chinese domestic goods."</p>
<p>So Mr. C was cured of his deep-rooted Western obsession by his wife and transformed into a passionate patriot and a member who loves to use all domestic goods.</p>

<h3>Principles of Beauty and Fit in Clothing</h3>
<p>— Qin Zhi</p>
<p>Since our country's Xuanyuan clan created clothing, more than four thousand years have passed, during which time there have been changes. Length, width, and narrowness have been repeatedly altered, truly because the way of clothing must both follow the evolution of the times to create aesthetic styles, and also align with the original purpose of hygiene to seek tailoring that fits the body. This is not merely for covering the body and keeping warm. In recent times, science has flourished, and human intelligence has also increased accordingly. In all things, we seek to promote benefits and eliminate drawbacks, discarding the crude and embracing the new. Moreover, clothing is the foremost of the four necessities of life, and striving for its reform is even more important than other items. Therefore, European and Western countries devote themselves to research on clothing, sparing no effort. The dressmakers, in particular, compete with each other in ingenuity and strength. Looking back at our country's dressmakers, they only know to follow old methods, lack specialized knowledge, and have even less relevant experience, let alone aesthetic sense and fit. They hardly know whether our clothing is suitable or not, primarily depending on the quality of its tailoring, with the cost of the materials being secondary. Consider expensive materials like silk and satin. If the tailoring is not done properly, it will not only lose its beauty but also evoke aversion. Conversely, inexpensive materials like homespun cloth, if tailored properly, will not only enhance beauty but also align with the original purpose of hygiene. It is like a chef cooking vegetables. Regardless of whether they are garden vegetables or plain dishes, as long as the cooking is done properly – what should be salty, what should be sweet, what should have added fragrance, and what should have added spice – the result can surpass even the most exquisite delicacies. Conversely, if rare delicacies are not cooked properly, the raw materials may be expensive, but the taste will be like chewing wax, which is a pity. Applying this analogy, how important is tailoring to clothing? The Hongxiang Company specializes in making various styles of women's clothing, studying the ancient styles passed down from previous generations and extensively researching the improved new methods of Europe and the West, discarding the crude and preserving the essence. It also hires specialized talent and applies methods of borrowing and contrasting, along with the study of color schemes. Regardless of whether the material is silk or cloth, they can all handle it with ease. Now, because the company is dedicated to serving the women's community, it is happy to answer any inquiries about domestic clothing materials.</p>
<h3>Long-Term Resistance and the Cloth Clothing Movement</h3>
<p>Recently, it was heard that the Japanese anticipate a large number of orders from countries around the world from 1936 to 1937. They are exciting the national sentiment, calling on people to save money in preparation to support the great war for three years. Our country's wounds have not yet healed. Once a world war breaks out, both finances and talent will be exhausted. What ability do we have to participate? Therefore, during this time of national crisis (assumed to be five years), we should strive to economize on all material resources. Even wealthy families wearing cloth clothing to save financial resources is no great loss. Everyone has the heart of resisting to the death, and everyone has the thought of wiping out humiliation and avenging. We can seek the fortune of heaven and strive for one in ten thousand survival. Even today, a strong nation like Japan still has a National Products Promotion Committee that investigates national purchases of foreign goods and finds that there are still over 140 types. After research, they found that domestic products can replace 120 types of foreign goods. There are still over 20 types for which there is nothing to replace. Why must our people prefer foreign goods for everyday necessities like clothing? If they are not out of their minds, how can they bear to do this? This is the argument for wearing cloth clothing for long-term resistance.</p>
<p>The suffering of the rural areas has reached its extreme. After the floods, there followed the ravages of war. Fortunately, last year was uneventful, but the prices of rice and wheat were low, and selling them was worthless. However, the payment of rent and taxes remained the same, and the collection of debts remained the same. People want to sell their cultivated land, but there are no buyers. They want to pawn all their belongings, but pawnshops are closed. Strong and violent men become bandits. At best, there are petty thefts. At worst, there are robberies and kidnappings for a living. Young women all go to Shanghai to work as maids, struggling to make a living. The fields are barren, families are ruined, and people die. What they witness is heartbreaking, beyond what pen and ink can describe. Now, the purpose of the Homespun Cloth Movement is to directly promote domestic products and resist enemy goods, indirectly relieving the rural areas. Spinning and weaving were originally sideline occupations for rural farmers during leisure time. All parts of our Jiangsu province are capable of doing so. However, because of the popularity of foreign cloth, and the fact that the enemy country seized the sales channels for homespun cloth in the three northeastern provinces, handmade production is almost non-existent. Now, if we vigorously promote it, and 400 million people wear cloth clothing during the national crisis, then if each person uses four bolts of homespun cloth per year, there will be a sales volume of 1.6 billion bolts. If the weaving cost of homespun cloth is calculated at 30 cents per bolt, the farmers will have an income of 480 million yuan. From where could the government find such a large sum of money to relieve the rural areas? Moreover, spinning and weaving skills are familiar to rural women, so there is no need to hire craftsmen to teach them. Farm families already have spinning and weaving equipment, so there is no need to raise a huge sum of money to start the business. Each family can increase sideline production while still raising children and managing household affairs, without the suffering of leaving their hometowns to live the factory life of going out in the morning and returning in the evening. What benefit is greater than this in promoting homespun cloth? However, promotion is not difficult; sales channels are. The power of one person is limited, so we must rely on 400 million people to make a vow to wear cloth clothing to succeed. Whenever there are disasters in various places, and relief funds are raised, all our compatriots enthusiastically contribute because it benefits the disaster victims. Now, if we wear cloth clothing, we can resist inferior goods, express patriotism, and the cloth we buy will be funds to relieve the rural areas. Why would people not be happy to do so? I hope that patriotic men and women will not only wear cloth clothing themselves but also widely encourage their compatriots to happily buy cloth clothing. Wearing one more cloth clothing is like saving one more farm family's life. This is why saving the rural areas is even more important than promoting cloth clothing.</p>
<p>During this period of promoting domestic goods, patriotic people are all advocating and publicizing domestic products. The great river does not refuse small streams, and the peaks of the mountains are based on the soil. Rural homespun cloth is closely related to handmade sideline occupations. If its use is promoted, it may be a way to resist inferior goods.</p>
<h3>My Thoughts on Clothing</h3>
<p>— Pan Hengruo</p>
<p>Clothing should be clean and not ostentatious, and we should avoid extravagance. Clothing is the biggest expense for us women. Ms. Li, who lives next door to the east, spends about four to five thousand yuan a year on clothing materials. Ms. Wang, who lives next door to the west, spends more than one thousand yuan a year just on tailoring fashionable clothes. This situation is jaw-dropping. In fact, a person needs beautiful behavior, a beautiful disposition, beautiful words, and beautiful knowledge. As for clothing, as long as it is domestic, elegant, and always able to show beauty, why must we buy foreign goods, wear European and American silk and satin, buy foreign patterns, and then make it into Liang-style clothing? In my opinion, the key points of clothing are cleanliness, simplicity, elegance, and especially durability. My annual clothing expenses are only about fifty yuan. What suits my taste best are silk and satin – domestic silk and satin, which are the national essence of China, are cheap and of good quality, and are welcomed by everyone. Products from Mayar Silk Mill are enough to meet our needs.</p>
<p>The other is cloth – domestic cloth, which is even more the national soul of China, is simple and elegant, and clean, is what everyone is happy to wear. The new dyeing and weaving products from Zhixia are suitable for everyone to wear. During this year of national goods, if we continue to promote it, it can become popular throughout the country.</p>
<p>Besides being happy to wear silk and satin clothes in the summer, I still wear cloth clothes in the three seasons of autumn and winter. Therefore, Hongxin Cloth and Mayar Silk are my loyal customers. I hope my sisters will all try it out.</p>

<h3>From a Three-Tube Radio to a Three-Tube Transmitter</h3>
<p>— Zhu Ziyuan</p>
<p>If you already have a three-tube radio with one-stage detection and two-stage low-frequency amplification, then it is not difficult to convert it into a three-tube transmitter, and the additional parts required are not many. If you are interested in transmission, just take it and modify it, changing from a radio to a transmitter. Wouldn't that be interesting?</p>
<p>Below is an introduction to the modification method. For the sake of clarity, only the triode is taken as an example. If it is an AC device, it can also be modified in the same way, with minor differences.</p>
<p>The circuit diagram and explanation are as follows:</p>
<p>CC1 is a .0005 microfarad variable capacitor</p>
<p>C2 is a .003 microfarad fixed capacitor</p>
<p>C3 is a .00025 microfarad fixed capacitor</p>
<p>L is a tuning coil</p>
<p>RFC is a high-frequency choke coil, using a 2-inch diameter rubber tube, wound with 28-gauge silk-covered wire for 200 turns.</p>
<p>LFC is a low-frequency choke coil, which can be replaced by a low-frequency transformer with a broken primary coil (use its secondary) circuit diagram</p>
<p>R is a 10,000-ohm fixed resistor</p>
<p>Rr is a 6-ohm variable resistor</p>
<p>T is a low-frequency transformer</p>
<p>T' is a modulation transformer, which can be replaced by a low-frequency transformer.</p>
<p>D is a microphone battery, from 4.5 volts to 6 volts.</p>
<p>It can be said that the above parts can all be found in the radio, but the microphone and the 10,000-ohm fixed resistor R need to be purchased. This magazine has already published a method of making a gramophone pickup using a stethoscope. Readers can also imitate it according to the method. As for the wiring and arrangement, they are the same as the installation method of a radio. The RFC should not be placed in the magnetic field of L. It is best to keep it away or at a right angle.</p>
<p>The manufacturing method of L is as follows: Use a 4-inch long and 2.5-inch diameter rubber tube, leaving half an inch empty at each end, and wind 30 turns with 18-gauge wire (10 turns per inch), and adjust with a sliding key. The sliding rod is connected to A+ (K in the figure). The wavelength is approximately from 150 to 200 meters.</p>
<p>After assembly, you can use a radio suitable for 150 to 200 meters to listen nearby to correct your own wavelength. However, be careful not to intrude into the broadcasting range. At the same time, to be careful, it is still best to register with the Ministry of Communications. I think the authorities will not necessarily disapprove of amateur experiments, right?</p>
<p>As for the adjustment method, this magazine continuously publishes Mr. Luo Jingyu's "Shortwave Transmitter Adjustment Method and Steps". Readers can read it carefully.</p>
<h3>Further Discussion on Remedying Unstable Power Supply Voltage</h3>
<p>— Wei Xin Su</p>
<p>The instability of power supply voltage has a significant impact on radios and should not be ignored. Excessive voltage will shorten the life of vacuum tubes, rectifiers, and filters, and may even cause damage. However, insufficient voltage not only weakens the volume and diminishes selectivity but also harms the vacuum tubes. When the filament temperature is too low, arcing often occurs.</p>
<p>In a previous issue of this magazine, the author suggested connecting a step-down transformer in series with the radio's power supply transformer to adjust the voltage. Although this method is simple and economical, it requires constant manual adjustments and is not suitable for general radio users. Therefore, two other types of automatic voltage regulators are introduced below.</p>
<p>Voltage regulators available on the market are made of variable resistors placed in a perforated metal cylinder. When encountering excessive voltage, their resistance increases with temperature. When encountering normal or low voltage, their resistance is very low. Although this type of regulator can suppress excessive voltage, it is powerless against voltage drops. Now, according to the method in Figure 1, if the lowest voltage in a certain area is 100V, you can connect a door-bell transformer with an input of 110V and an output of 12V in series, so that this 12V is added to the 100V to raise the voltage to 112V, and after passing through the regulator, you can get 110V. This device can automatically adjust even if the power supply voltage returns to normal or becomes excessive. As the voltage increases, its resistance also increases, keeping the voltage supplied to the radio close to 110V. It should be noted that the ampere rating of the door-bell transformer used above must not be less than the ampere required by the radio.</p>
<h3>Figure 1 Figure 2</h3>
<p>A voltage compensator is a specially designed step-up autotransformer as shown in Figure 2. When the voltage drops, this step-up transformer can raise the voltage to restore it to normal. Part C in the figure functions slightly below the magnetic permeability saturation knee of the core. If the voltage is excessive, the saturation of part C of the core will also increase, so a strong part of the magnetic lines passes through part D through the gap, which causes the B coil to generate the opposite polarity and eliminate the excess voltage. The author is not clear whether this voltage compensator can be bought in stores in Shanghai. In the United States, there is a product from Sola Corp. with an input voltage from 95V to 135V, which can supply 100 watts of power.</p>
<h3>The Method of Making a Tungar Tube Charger</h3>
<p>— Yizhi</p>
<p>Friends who have storage batteries will feel that it is troublesome and expensive to carry the bulky storage batteries to the electrical material store for charging. Who doesn't want to have a charger of their own, just plug the plug into the light wire, connect the positive and negative wires on the charger, and remove it after it is fully charged? How convenient! However, buying a charger costs more than fifty or sixty yuan. Some people are afraid of being limited by their finances, and some are reluctant to spend so much money, so they can't charge it themselves, and they have to suffer every month by moving the battery back and forth. I am also one of the sufferers. I often complain when I want to charge it. Therefore, I decided to make a charger myself. After more than ten days of work, I made a Tungar tube charger. It cost a total of more than 20 yuan, and the results are pretty good. If compared with foreign goods, the effect is the same, but the money is saved by more than half. It is now a time to promote domestic goods, economic patriotism, and save a sum of money, which will be sent to foreigners. Moreover, after doing it myself, I gained an experience, and if it is damaged, I can repair it myself. Isn't it a very worthwhile thing to do? I think there must be many friends who like to play with wireless and want to make this charger, so I will introduce the manufacturing method (because of space limitations, I cannot explain it in detail, I can only select the essentials to describe: if you have any questions, please submit a letter to this magazine and forward it to me, so that I can give instructions and conduct joint research.)</p>
<p>The materials needed for this Tungar Charger are listed below:</p>
<p>Tungar Tube One</p>
<p>110V 40W Carbon lamp One</p>
<p>Transformer One (self-made or modified)</p>
<p>Ammeter One</p>
<p>Resistor One</p>
<p>Screw lamp holder Two</p>
<p>Plug and socket Three pairs</p>
<p>17-gauge double yarn-wrapped wire More than two pounds</p>
<p>16-gauge double yarn-wrapped wire Eighty feet</p>
<p>German Silver Wire Thirty feet, etc.</p>
<p>Except for the Tungar tube, carbon filament lamp, and ammeter, the other items listed above cannot be made by oneself, the rest can be bought and configured.</p>
<p>Tungar tubes commonly used on the market are produced by General Electric Company of America. It has two advantages: (1) durable, (2) good efficiency. The types depend on the current capacity, divided into: (1) 2 amps (2) 6 amps. Now we buy a 2-amp type that is enough. The 2-amp Tungar form is shown in Figure 1</p>
<p>Figure 1</p>
<p>There is a mercury-like substance coated inside this tube. The lower part is slightly transparent, and you can see the filament and the screen. The filament is made of tungsten wire, and the screen is made of carbon. When you buy it, the filament is slightly shiny; the surface of the screen is very smooth and has no black spots.</p>
<p>Ammeter If you already have a volt-ampere meter, or a milliampere meter with a shunt, you can use it without buying it.</p>
<p>Transformer If it is used on an AC generator with 60-70 watts of power, it can be used. Just disassemble and rewind the coil to complete it. If you want to make one yourself, buy about 4 pounds of 4 1/2" x 1 1/2" silicon steel sheets. Prepare the iron sheets, and then make two winding frames that are fitted on the iron sheets, and you can start winding. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Random Musings on Radio (4)</h3>
<p>— Wei Yan</p>
<p>(On the current status of the broadcasting industry in China)</p>
<p>XHAA, a radio station affiliated with the Chinese and Western Pharmacy, is known for its high-quality programming, with more academic programs than any other station. Recently, it has added morning exercises and movie reviews, which show its commitment to promoting sports and culture. However, the amount of advertising on the station is truly annoying. On average, there are several long advertisements for every half side of a record. Sometimes, when the mood strikes, they even insert advertisements while broadcasting records, which makes people feel dizzy and disoriented. If it is a special program, there will be more than ten advertisements at a time, which makes people sigh in disbelief. I am not against radio stations including advertisements in their programs, but there should be an appropriate amount of advertising. Too much advertising will make listeners switch to other stations, and the effectiveness of the advertisement will be zero. I think it is best to insert some advertisements after the end of one program and before the start of the next program. The number of advertisements can be increased at a time, but the time should not be too long. The wording should be concise and not repetitive. In this way, listeners will not switch the channel because they are eagerly awaiting the next program. (The Huamei and Yadong stations, etc., insert a short advertisement after each record, which we consider to be the most effective.)</p>
<p>XMHA, a broadcasting station established by Westerners in Shanghai, also has four or five stations, and their power is very large. Among them, the Western Huamei Broadcasting Station is the most popular with listeners for its long hours of Western music from 7:00 am to 12:30 pm every day. It is said that the pitch of their broadcasting machine can be controlled at any time, so the sound waves emitted are very pleasant to listen to.</p>
<h3>Common Sense</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiancun</p>
<p>(18) Overview of Vacuum Tubes (2)</p>
<p>(C) (B)</p>
<p>Tetrode: What distinguishes a tetrode from a triode is that the former has one more grid, that is, it is composed of a screen grid, a filament, and two grids. As shown in the figure above, (a) is the symbol used for tetrodes. In the figure, the one close to the filament is called the inner grid, and the one close to the screen grid is called the outer grid. Because of the different uses of these two inner and outer grids, tetrodes are divided into two types: screen grid tubes and space charge grid tubes. (b) The figure shows the structure and connection method of a space charge grid tube. In the figure, F is the filament, SCG is the space charge grid, CG is the control grid, and P is the screen grid. The space charge grid is connected to a positive voltage, and its function is to offset the negative electric field of space electrons to reduce the screen voltage. Originally, electrons emitted by the filament are distributed in the vacuum tube. These electrons form a negative electric field in the tube, which is the negative electric field of space electrons. In a triode, because of the existence of a negative electric field, it cannot be used unless the screen voltage is increased. However, the tetrode has another device to offset this negative electric field, which can reduce the screen voltage to increase its effectiveness. (c) The figure shows the structure and connection method of a screen grid tube. Its outer grid is used as the screen grid SG. The only difference from figure (b) is this point. In addition to offsetting the negative electric field of space electrons, the function of the screen grid is to reduce the internal capacitance of the tube to eliminate the drawbacks of its self-oscillation. The reason why tetrodes are particularly suitable for high-frequency amplifiers lies in this. Although there are two types of tetrodes mentioned above, because the function of the screen grid tube is superior, the screen grid tube is more used today, while the space charge grid tube is almost eliminated.</p>

<h3>"Negotiated" Literary Giants</h3>
<p>— Bai Zaixuan</p>
<p>The tip of the pen is also sharp and must penetrate. If it cannot penetrate elsewhere, it can only exaggerate the advertisements in literary magazines and stab them.</p>
<p>Looking at the magazine's advertisements, every author is a literary giant. It seems that the Chinese literary scene is so bright and magnificent. However,</p>
<p>It also attracts snorts from the nostrils. However, writers who write for a lifetime and hide their names in famous mountains, waiting for archaeological teams to excavate them, no longer exist. Even poets who write and carve their own works into a thin book and distribute it to friends are rarely encountered. Now, manuscripts are written one week, published the next week, clipped and pasted last month, and published next month, mostly just for稿費. If we say that the authors are starving and dedicated to serving society, I am afraid that it would be a bit embarrassing to say, even the noble person who laughs at people needing稿費 still cannot avoid needing稿費 for his mocking article. But of course, literary giants who have other salaries or can rely on women's dowries to support them do not belong to this category.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the root is in selling money, so the various literary giants in Shanghai have been "negotiated" for a long time.</p>
<p>After the merchant prints a manuscript, if feudalism is in power at that time, the advertisement will say that the author is a feudal literary giant. When the revolution is in progress, he will be a revolutionary literary giant. Thus, a group of literary giants is sealed. If another company's book is also printed, another advertisement will say that the author is not a real feudal or revolutionary literary giant, but that this side's is the real thing. Thus, another group of literary giants is sealed. Another company gathers and prints various argumentative advertisements. An author adds some criticism, and another new literary giant emerges.</p>
<p>Another method is to combine a set of characters, ask a few poets, a few novelists, and a critic to discuss and establish some kind of society. When the advertisement is published, they overthrow the existing literary giants and promote new literary giants. As a result, a group of literary giants can always be sealed, which is also a kind of "negotiation".</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the root is selling money, so the later book prices will inevitably point out the true value of the literary giants, priced at two catties for one, or five cents a pile, which is also uncertain. However, there is one exception: when a store clears out its inventory and sells its works cheaply, it is not because the literary giants have reached the end of the road, but because they have already "climbed up" and entered universities and government offices, and no longer need this stepping stone.</p>
<h3>China as Seen by Americans</h3>
<p>— Yao Ke</p>
<p>In recent years, sales of books and newspapers about China in the American publishing world have shown a considerable surge. Pearl Buck's "The Good Earth," needless to say, had already "spread without needing to be pushed," earning world renown. Considering only the books published this year, there are too many about China to read them all. From what I have personally seen, there are two books that are very worthy of our attention, and from which we can understand what "China as Seen by Americans" is all about.</p>
<p>One is "Far Eastern Front," published in September of this year. The author, Edgar Snow, is a Far East correspondent for an American news agency. In this 336-page book, he starkly exposes the entire Far Eastern situation. The "aggressor nation's" conspiracy to annex the Northeast, the process of the loss of the three Northeastern provinces, the inside story of "non-resistance," the sketches of the Battle of Shanghai and the establishment of the puppet state, the fall of Jehol and the meaning of the Tanggu Truce—all unfold like a movie in this book. The subtlety and thoroughness of his observations, the vividness and accuracy of his writing style, and the fairness and incisiveness of his argumentation are truly astonishing. But what moved me most were the chapters on the Chinese people and the political status quo, and the inferences about the future of the Far East situation. The author says on page 326: "Over the years, names, governments, and plans have changed, but the play on stage remains the same. All kinds of bad elements and qualities seem to continue endlessly—lacking meaning, unity, and scientific action." This is China as seen by Americans—although very disappointing, we cannot find any evidence to refute this view. Facts speak louder than words; even if we argue, it would only be like "taking off our pants to cover our face," making us look even more shameful.</p>
<p>There are many more pertinent and poignant words, and I originally wanted to translate a few sentences, but due to lack of free time, I can only let readers find the original book themselves.</p>
<p>Another book is the novel "The House of Exile" by female writer Nora Waln. This book was published in April of this year and has been reprinted eight times in just three months, and is said to be the best-selling novel in the United States this year. However, the story in the book is not only ordinary but also dull, and the absurdities in it are too numerous to list. For example: a woman who gets married in November gives birth to a son by February of the following year, and there is no description or possibility of her and her fiancé "trading beforehand"; Cai Tingkai of the Nineteenth Route Army has become a nationally renowned "dreamy young poet"; a Chinese family with six generations living under one roof can trace its genealogy to more than 139 generations. Even the "Duke Yansheng" of our Shandong is only the 77th generation descendant of Confucius—we can laugh at these absurdities. However, there are many fallacies about politics and society in it that cannot be tolerated. For example, she said that China had already begun to fiercely boycott Japanese goods in the spring of 1931, but in fact, it was not until after the Wanbaoshan Incident on July 2 that there was a boycott movement. As for the depiction of Chinese life, it is even more absurd and gives American readers a very erroneous impression.</p>
<p>What is most annoying is the author's own standpoint. Although this book is called a novel, it is actually written in the tone of an "eyewitness" autobiography. American readers who have never been to China can easily mistake it for the truth, which is what we expected. What's more, Pearl Buck praised it, saying, "There is no question about the authenticity of this book." This is another unpleasant book.</p>
<p>The above two books give me two different kinds of unpleasantness. The first is the unpleasantness of—as Oscar Wilde once said—"Caliban seeing his true face in the mirror," and the second is the unpleasantness of "Caliban not seeing his true face in the mirror." "Far Eastern Front," in my opinion, is the most faithful and sharp in its observations of the Sino-Japanese conflict and the current situation in China, and its argumentation is the most insightful and fair, but it inevitably shows us our ugliness. For me, it's just a little unpleasant, but wealthy people may be (unable?) to laugh or cry after reading it. As for the book "The House of Exile," unless we want to find some laughs, we might as well not read it; but I think the Chinese PEN might as well send some comments to the United States to correct this erroneous impression, so as to avoid the joke of American poets asking Cai Tingkai to write couplets in the future.</p>
<h3>Villagers</h3>
<p>— Cheng Yunping</p>
<p>Everyone's hearts were filled with suspicion, and a little panic. It wasn't unusual for a monk seeking alms to come to the village. But in these years of war and chaos, even a slight deviation from the ordinary, like someone shouting a few times in the middle of the night, could make the villagers jump out of bed and run barefoot outside. With the arrival of the monk, everyone suspected that he was a spy, sent by bandits to scout whether there were any troops stationed there. The monk was a strong man in his thirties, and everyone said that if he hadn't been sent by the bandits, how could he be so physically strong? As he walked along the road, he kept knocking on his wooden fish and looking around, which was further proof that he had ulterior motives. The monk was staying in the Guandi Temple at the head of the village. So, a large group of people went to investigate.</p>
<p>The moonlight wasn't very bright, and the wind rustled through the grass. The group of people discussed in hushed tones on the road. Some advocated stopping him and sending him to the city tomorrow, while others advocated getting rid of him tonight, lest he harm our village. Everyone tiptoed, trying not to let him know, so that they could see what he was doing there.</p>
<p>Peeking through the crack in the door, the monk was unexpectedly calmly sitting in meditation and chanting scriptures. So, everyone rushed in like a swarm of bees. The monk greeted everyone very politely.</p>
<p>"Where did you come from, Master?" the leader asked directly.</p>
<p>"Hunan XX Mountain. What brings you all here?" the monk replied very respectfully.</p>
<p>"Please leave this place!"</p>
<p>"These days, it's not good for strangers to stay!" everyone shouted along.</p>
<p>The monk asked to leave early the next morning. However, everyone refused to allow it. Everyone clamored and shouted. The monk helplessly packed his luggage and left in the night. But everyone was still suspicious, afraid that he might come back tonight and that something might happen. Even the children couldn't sleep soundly. They were filled with suspicion and panic until daybreak.</p>
<h3>The Human World</h3>
<p>— Liao Botan</p>
<p>So tired, so thirsty! Sweat! Sweat rolling down.</p>
<p>My hat is dripping. This deadly hot summer!</p>
<p>I rested in XX Park.</p>
<p>The men carrying shoulder poles groaned; the trees drooped their heads lazily...</p>
<p>The world seemed exhausted! But they had to call out, to groan.</p>
<p>Flies, bees, "mosquitoes," flying here, buzzing there, truly busy.</p>
<p>From outside came the clanging sound of a blind fortune-teller, slowly, bringing a touch of serenity.</p>
<p>From that side, a gray friend came walking, with a broken leg and an injured hand, and sat down beside me.</p>
<p>His face, paper-white and tinged with gray-black; one hand bandaged and hanging; a wooden crutch replacing his foot.</p>
<p>Standing at the edge of the world, this poor man! I thought.</p>
<p>"Ah!" he sighed; his eyes drooped, lazy; after a moment, he raised his face, now nothing but skin and bones, looked at the sky; then, immediately, he lowered it again.</p>
<p>Is this a human being?</p>
<p>丨At least there's a skeleton here, even skeletons are gone beneath the Jizhong Pagoda! Who was saying that, I don't know.</p>
<p>I glanced at him sideways, he was weeping.</p>
<p>He was weeping, and I was weeping too, why?</p>
<p>Looking more closely, a photo of an old woman, fifty or sixty years old, was spinning in his hand!</p>
<h3>The Two Brothers (25)</h3>
<p>— By Maupassant, translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>Then he suddenly sat down again. He didn't like her, this woman! Why? She belonged to the kind of ordinary and base considerations; and besides, wasn't she comparatively fond of Zhean? Although he himself didn't explicitly admit it, most of the reason why he didn't think much of this widow was because she preferred Zhean, because although he liked his younger brother, he always thought he was a bit mediocre, while he himself was comparatively superior.</p>
<p>In any case, he couldn't sit here until evening; so, like the previous evening, he anxiously wondered: "What should I do?"</p>
<p>He now felt that his heart needed to be moved, needed someone to embrace him, to comfort him. What exactly did he need comforting for? He himself couldn't say for sure, but he was now feeling weak and tired; at this time, the appearance of a woman, a woman's comfort, the touch of a slender hand, the rustling of a woman's dress, a black or blue tender look in the eyes, seemed to be what our hearts urgently demanded, absolutely essential.</p>
<p>He now remembered a young waitress in a beer hall who had taken him home to sleep one night and whom he had often seen since then.</p>
<p>So he stood up again, preparing to go and have a beer with this girl. What was he going to say to her? What would he say to her? Undoubtedly, nothing at all. But what did that matter? He could hold her hand for a while. She seemed to like him. Why hadn't he gone to see her more often?</p>
<p>When he arrived, she was sitting on a chair dozing off in the almost empty beer hall. A customer was resting his arm on the oak table smoking a pipe, the woman in charge was reading a novel, and the owner of the beer hall was sound asleep on the wooden stool wearing only his undershirt.</p>
<p>The girl, as soon as she saw him, quickly stood up and walked over to him, saying:</p>
<p>"Good morning, how are you?"</p>
<p>"Not bad, and you?"</p>
<p>"Me, I'm great. You rarely come, do you?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I simply can't find the time. You know I'm a doctor."</p>
<p>"Oh, you never told me that before. If I had known you were a doctor, I would have asked you to see me when I was sick last week. What do you want to drink?"</p>
<p>"A beer, and you?"</p>
<p>"Me, I'll also have a beer, anyway, you're paying for it."</p>
<p>She continued to talk to him in an intimate tone, as if him buying her a beer implicitly gave her this right. So the two sat down face to face and chatted. She often took his hand in an affectatious way that women who sell smiles easily have, and looked at him with an enticing gaze, saying to him:</p>
<p>"Why don't you come more often? Darling, I really like you."</p>
<p>But he was already getting tired of her, finding her stupid, ordinary, and smelling of the lower classes. He thought: women should appear in dreams or in a luxurious atmosphere that can poeticize their vulgarity.</p>
<p>She asked him:</p>
<p>"One morning you walked past with a handsome man with golden hair and a full beard, was that your brother?"</p>
<p>"Yes, that's my brother."</p>

<h3>Financial Exchange Soars, Gold Price Drops Another $6.50; New Low of $727.50 Appears on the Market; Weakness in Futures Increases, Stable Process All Day</h3>
<p>The gold market continued to decline yesterday, breaking the $30 mark. It remained stable after opening, but the outlook was still calm. In the morning, the overseas silver market showed rises in both the UK and US. The five-metal exchange showed a futures silver price increase of 2.5 to 4 points. Exchange rates continued to rise wildly. London spot gold fell 11 pence, the US official gold buying price rose another 10 cents to $33.15, stocks rose 8.5 cents, US cotton rose 15 pounds, and US wheat rose 3.5 points. The wool market opened initially at 25 yuan, then saw internal buying up to 28 yuan. After opening, the domestic market was relatively tight and the situation was quite firm. Major players bought in, causing further increases. Unexpectedly, banks took advantage of the high prices to sell off, supply became abundant, and the exchange rate relaxed, retreating to within $30. At noon, it struggled around the $30 mark. Subsequent trading saw even smaller fluctuations, the situation was boring, and it always revolved around the $30 mark. The domestic market was flat and lacked transactions, so there were no special changes in the gold market. It was found that the market was stable throughout the day, and although it fell, it did not fall much. People's minds were also good. It was really the exchange rate's rise was fierce, but the increase in futures silver was not strong. Traders still expected a reaction and rebound, so they maintained their strength. Reuters reported that the Bank of France's reserves had decreased by another 100 million francs, which was due to the outflow of foreign capital. The gold market was stable in contrast (recently, due to the unlimited expansion of the US dollar, the franc was unstable, and gold savings would generally be converted to British pounds, abandoning the US dollar, so there was another reason to see a decline). The cost of ingot red gold was 1,100 yuan. The market situation for the day is recorded below.</p>
<p>The opening was 7287 yuan, down 8 yuan and 60 cents from the previous close. Goods opened at 8 yuan and 10 cents. The exchange market's morning opening for recent sales was British exchange at 1 shilling, 3 pence, 5625, US exchange at 22 yuan, 875. Bingxing, Zhaofengchang, Zhifeng, Yongda, Decheng took orders, rising from 7 yuan and 50 cents to 30 yuan and 20 cents. Pan Gen and Ba grabbed March US dollars at 5625. Yuansheng, Yongyuanmao, and Yonghengtai sold off. Datong sold January US dollars at 125. It was pre-heard that HSBC's listing was British flat and US up 375. At this time, it was still difficult to be firm. Yuanchun also sold, Hui Long was at 28 yuan and 80 cents, hovering uncertainly. Then, Ruixing, Yuanheng, Qianchang, Xiangheng, Yu, Zhaofengchang, Fuyu, Daxingyong, etc. successively bought in, Huabi grabbed March US dollars at 4375. Although Bingxing sold, it still rose to 34 yuan and 20 cents. Goods and the Dalian gang supplied. Huabi sold March US dollars at 375. HSBC sold January 33 yuan, and the shape fell. Shengda, Hengxing, and Shunli sold again, then broke 30 yuan, because Citibank sold December US dollars at 875. Then it sold 9375 again, Qianchang sold to 28 yuan and 50 cents, goods worked hard to take orders, then rebounded to over 30 yuan. Mitsui grabbed March US dollars at 5625, Fuyu advanced to 32 yuan, Daxingyong came to sell, Longwei 29 yuan 30 cents, goods still bought, but Mitsui finally sold February US dollars at 3125, although it rose, it fell again to 28 yuan 70 cents, so Hengyu and Zhifengyong sold off, Chunyuan Yong etc. bought at low prices, the noon close was 734 yuan 60 cents, goods traded at 29 yuan 80 cents.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 729 yuan 80 cents, goods opened at 9 yuan 80 cents, Hengxing and Tianfeng sold, but Mitsui ate March US dollars at 5625, gradually rising from 9 yuan and 10 cents to 30 yuan and 8 cents, Yongfeng sold orders, and retreated to 29 yuan and 10 cents, bank appetite tended to close, at this time the situation was quite stable, Fuchang, Yuanmao, Yong advanced to over 30 yuan, Yida and Yonghengxing sold orders, then fell to around 9 yuan, but Huabi grabbed January US dollars at 1875, Mitsui took March 5625, Dalian gang and Hengyu Bingxing all advanced, and rose to 30 yuan and 6 cents, after hovering, the close was 730 yuan and 10 cents, trading was thin, quite boring, goods traded at 02 cents, after the market closed, it was stable due to Ruifeng and others taking orders, and finally rebounded to over 1 yuan, it was found that the highest price of the day was 734 yuan 2 cents, the lowest price was 727 yuan 5 cents, only 6 yuan and 7 cents difference, the result was a decrease of 6 yuan and 50 cents compared with the previous close,</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Shows Slight Discrepancies</h3>
<p>New Fung Foreign Firm reports: On the 9th, the New York stock market saw a slight decline due to the low price of the US dollar. However, public utility stocks in four cities remained strong despite the failure to pass the measurement. At closing, bullish investors took profits, leading to slight discrepancies. The market condition seemed to gradually trend upward, with a total daily trading volume of 2.9 million shares. Wheat prices were significantly impacted by the dollar's depreciation. It is anticipated that those holding currency will gradually exchange it for goods. Cotton was also affected by the dollar's decline, with widespread buying leading to price increases. Sales were primarily from the South, but the market easily absorbed them. The silver market was notably strong, fueled by rumors from Washington that the government would purchase large quantities of silver to remint currency. The flight of US dollars into silver was also a major factor. At closing, many began to emerge. According to the "Steel Age" report, steel production capacity for the week was 25.2%, with no significant changes expected in the short term. Although government funds are being used to purchase rails, implementation may be delayed until December or next year.

<h3>Yarn &amp; Cotton: Lacking Sales Momentum in the Marked Yarn Market</h3>
<p>▲Previous Market Saw Ningbo Traders Selling Off, Followed by Profit-Taking to Cover▲</p>
<p>The yarn market fell in the morning but rebounded in the afternoon, with market sentiment being flat and listless. Actual demand was still maintained, but large-volume transactions were lacking. However, investor confidence was strengthened by a slight rise in US cotton prices, and the selling pressure eased slightly. In the morning, Ningbo traders sold off over 4,000 bales, causing the market to drop suddenly. In the afternoon, profit-taking and covering led to a rebound.</p>
<h3>Dull Cotton Yarn Market</h3>
<p>At the opening of the cotton yarn market in the morning, speculators from Ningbo sold off four to five thousand bales, suppressing the market.

<p>Guangdong 210 Shantou 65 Tianjin 90 Changsha 20</p>
<h3>Speculators Enter the Cotton Market in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The cotton market started weak but then strengthened, influenced by the consecutive days of gains in US cotton prices, which boosted investor confidence. However, the decline in gold prices and the rise in exchange rates led to hidden declines despite apparent gains. Spot cotton sales in the market were sluggish, and factories remained inactive. Speculators made purchases in the afternoon, causing the market to rebound slightly. However, the overall situation remained lackluster.</p>
<h3>Mediocre Zheng Cotton Market</h3>
<p>The Zheng cotton market opened weakly in the morning, with prices for all months falling by five to ten cents.

<h3>US Cotton Market Active and Firmly Bullish</h3>

<h3>Grains: Brisk Sales of Current Flour in the Northeast</h3>
<p>|| Flour Prices Repeatedly Increase ||</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw foreign wheat prices rise by $1.30 to $1.67 in the morning, boosting investor confidence due to firm orders. Current flour sales in the Northeast were very brisk, with numbers 3 and 4 flour and bran selling well in addition to number 2 flour. There were rumors in the market that these purchases were for military use, further fueling optimistic sentiment. The Northeast market was active, followed by the North China market, and there were also inquiries from Southeast Asia. As a result, marked flour prices rose immediately at the opening. Later, bullish investors sold off, and factories also secretly sold off distant months, causing the market to fall back temporarily. In the afternoon, however, inland speculators bought back, and the market rose again. The closing price for the current month was up 1.25 cents, the next month was up 1.5 cents, January was up 1.25 cents, February was up 0.75 cents, April was also up 0.75 cents, and March was up 1 cent.</p>
<h3>Sharp Decline in Wheat Futures</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market saw foreign wheat prices rise by $1.30 to $1.67, fueling optimistic sentiment. However, brokers sold off, and there were reports that foreign wheat orders would arrive, as well as wheat purchased on credit. As a result, marked wheat prices gradually fell after the market opened. In the afternoon, bullish investors took profits, making the market particularly weak. The closing price for November was down 0.2 cents, December was unchanged, January was down 0.4 cents, February was down 0.1 cents, and March was down 0.2 cents. There were no sales for April. The supply of spot wheat was low, and factory demand remained active. Fuxin selected and purchased 1,300 bags at higher prices, ranging from 45 cents to 78 cents. These included Yao Bay wheat at $3.99, Gao You wheat at $3.88, and Shashi wheat at $3.58.</p>
<h3>Southern Port Late Rice Gradually Rises</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday's supply from over twenty sources totaled over 3,000 piculs. Wholesale and retail demand was similar to the previous day. However, due to the scarcity of arrivals, the stock at the port gradually thinned, and sellers were asking for higher prices, leading to a tight situation and active market conditions. As a result, the market price of regular Shanghai and Suzhou rice, as well as southern port late rice, gradually rose by a few cents. Although prices of green glutinous rice and Fenglian late rice also rose by a cent or so, the tight customer demand made it difficult for both parties to reach an agreement until 2 PM. For example, a special price of $7.65 for green glutinous rice could not be agreed upon, even though this price was still considered a pre-arranged price. Due to the adoption of over 200 bags of Du Yang sharp rice, the market price improved by a cent or so. The activity of the metamorphism yuan wine merchants also resumed, and the market shape also turned positive.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, forty-six to forty-seven ships arrived from various routes downriver, but market sales remained sluggish. There was no significant change in the prices of new glutinous rice, broken glutinous rice, sheep rice, Du rice, port rice, customer sharp rice, and metamorphism yuan rice. The price of thin rice and early rice was slightly lower by a cent or so. White yuan rice remained extremely weak. Recently, the market situation has been in a state of flux, with no significant changes.</p>
<h3>Speculators Continue to Inquire About Hakka Indica Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Hakka indica rice market remained strong. Due to the consecutive small price increases in recent days, local Hakka speculators inquired about it. After activity in Quanzhou and Fuzhou in Fujian Province and on the street the day before, yesterday's purchasing appetite remained strong. However, cargo owners intended to call for higher prices, and the number of transactions was less than the previous day, but the situation was even more stable. The city sold 300 bags of Jiangbei machine indica rice and 1,700 bags of factory indica rice, which were purchased by the street and the Quanzhou gang. The Quanzhou gang also purchased 157 bags of Nanjing cart indica rice, 100 bags of Jiangxi machine late rice, and 388 bags of Wuhu machine indica rice. Those collected by the street were completely stockpiled, and the Quanzhou gang did not immediately pay for loading either. Market conditions were similar to the previous market. If there are more brisk transactions in the future, it may improve.</p>
<h3>Soybeans Lack Momentum for Increase</h3>
<p>Yesterday's soybean market remained in a state of high stability and weakness. There was little momentum for an increase in the short term. The supply continued to arrive one after another. Outlets, such as the inland and the street, were slightly active. The city traded eleven or twelve carts. Due to the lack of high-quality goods, the middle-grade goods also increased, while the lower-grade goods were adjusted down by one or two cents. The Yong gang continued to handle more than 200 bags of Liuhe goods of green beans, and the price opened at $6.64, and the market shape was quite stable.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: White Sugar Plunges Incessantly</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market was even weaker due to the small gains in customs gold and marked gold. The guild lowered the price of No. 24 coarse sand white ordinary goods by another dime, to $20.55, and less than 100 bags were traded. No. 20 medium sand white was only called for $20, and the asking price for No. 8 and 9 Dutch red sugar was slightly lower than before, but there were no transactions. The asking price for the local factory's No. 1 refined white sugar was also lowered by one dime, to $19.35, and the rest were returned and not opened. There was not much change in the Chaoqing number disc, but since foreign sugar has plummeted incessantly, it is difficult to be stable alone, so there were also no transactions.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Longkou Vermicelli is Cheap and Exceeds Heng</h3>
<p>Longkou vermicelli: Recently, with the flourishing of new goods, ground prices have gradually fallen, resulting in particularly low asking prices in the Shanghai market, showing new lows. It has been the only one in recent years, and now sales are not yet brisk and there is no hope of an increase. Yesterday, the market sold the first-brand Longkou vermicelli at $17.5, which was about $2 less than the previous month.</p>
<h3>Metals: American Tinplate is Popular and Sells Well in Guangdong</h3>
<p>American tinplate: Transactions have been extremely exciting recently. Customer gangs and factories sell very well, so in a few days, more than two thousand six or seven hundred boxes have been opened. Its price of 90 pounds per box is $16.5, 100 pounds is $17.5, while double-length goods are $33.75 for 90 pounds and $37 for 100 pounds. It is heard that egg factories, printing factories, etc. have decorated quite a bit in recent days. Because of the tight sales of the above-mentioned goods by the various gangs, the current stock on the market is somewhat unsustainable, so the market is very optimistic.</p>
<h3>New Black Iron Sheet Goods Arrive</h3>
<p>After the eighteen-sheet black iron sheet was purchased by various gangs in Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, and Ping, there was a risk that the circulating goods on the market would be unsustainable. The standard is soaring, and each load is as high as $11.8, which is $0.2 better than before. It is heard that the new batch of goods arrived yesterday with more than two thousand loads, so there is no need to worry about the stock of this product in the future.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Light Oil and New Goods Have Different Markets</h3>
<p>▲Hankou Oil Prices Rise...Zhejiang Province is Weak▲</p>
<p>After the light oil market in Hankou foreign firm transactions was sluggish, the market immediately showed a downturn. Last week, Hankou Xing sold foreign firms at a price of $24.7 per load, only a few dozen tons. Until Saturday last week, there seemed to be a trend of activity, and Hankou Xing increased the import of Xiang Tong slightly, already making a price of $20.03 to $20.06 for customer regulations. Until last night, a telegram from Hankou came saying that the foreign firm had sold it at $25.6, which was a rise of one dollar from last week. Although the market seemed normal, it was a sudden change at a time when new goods were about to arrive. It can be seen that the inventory of Chen oil is thin. According to the laws of Xiang, Hubei, Sichuan, and other provinces, the annual order of Tongzi is only half of last year's, so the poor harvest is a real situation, and prices have already arrived, so the locals are relatively firm, although the key of the market still depends on whether the foreign firms have them and how much there are, but it is easy to rise and difficult to fall. It can be predetermined that Zhejiang Province is close to the port, with convenient transportation. It can be reached from morning to evening. New goods in Hangzhou have already been seen last week, and they have been arriving one after another, seeing it getting more and more. However, most of what has arrived is to solve the pre-sale. Therefore, there are very few sales, and the market situation is weak. This is a sign of the new oil. The current oil has fallen from $23 per load to $22. Yesterday, I learned that the Hangzhou firm had to deliver hundreds of loads to the Shanghai Jiang Zhafang family, at a price of $22 per load. The delivery must be completed in this lunar month, and from $21.5 to $21.6, it must be completed before the 10th day of the first month of the lunar calendar, all delivered in the Jiang River. It is heard that the price of Tongzi at the place of origin is still cheap, and the cost may be within $20. According to the latest news last night, the Hangzhou firm had reached $20.08, and the delivery period was slightly later, and then there was $19.4, which would be longer. The more futures contracts are sold, the cheaper they are, and the future market is self-evident. The new oil that the companies in this port imported for sale has more than a thousand loads, but the delivery period has not yet arrived, so there have been few transactions recently. Although the Hankou foreign firm seems to be selling well, and the Zhejiang Tung oil is still lacking in godliness, I hope to be able to make a stand in the middle of the stream by borrowing from the northern sound, so as not to go further downstream, then the market will have a foothold, and the north and south will gradually tend to one way.</p>
<h3>Silk &amp; Tea: Sudden Changes in the London Tea Market</h3>
<p>London is an extremely large market for black tea sales. In recent years, due to the overproduction of Indian tin-lined safflower, tea prices have gradually fallen, and tea farmers and merchants have suffered from it. As a result of several restrictions on production by French, British and Dutch tea merchants, the backlog was finally cleared this spring, and Indian tin tea prices have gradually risen again. Due to the lower selling price of black tea in the two lakes of China than that of Indian tin tea, sales have been very active. According to statistics, no less than 80,000 boxes were imported into the United Kingdom this year, Qining black tea</p>
<p>The news that the experts got changed suddenly. Indian tin tea prices have plummeted. Except for high-quality Qimen goods, Chinese tea has not been much affected, and the rest are all stockpiled and not moving. The reason is that the deterioration of Russian-Japanese relations has completely stagnated the trade in Indian and Javanese tea with Russia.</p>

<h3>"Fishing for the Moon in the Sea"</h3>
<p>— of</p>
<p>To fish for the moon in the sea is to sink one's body to the bottom of the sea, and it is also something that cannot be caught. Because the moon is produced in the sky, and the sea is only a faint and empty shadow of it. Think about it. Can a faint and empty shadow be caught? Unless he's really a fool!</p>
<p>Although, but people always like to do this faint and empty sea-fishing moon business 丨丨 The more faint and empty and unpredictable, the more they like to do it, and the more crazy and universal they do it! In the past, I only heard that there were many poets and literati who drove a small boat on a still night with a bright moon and sparse stars, and went to the lake to drink wine and compose poems and write fu facing the moon (the moon in the moon). It is said that this is the most elegant thing, but in fact, it is at most a kind of plaything belonging to windiness and boredom. Although they are only humming in their mouths, expressing appreciation and praise for this faint and empty moon in the water, after all, they have not taken off their socks, rolled up their trousers, and gone into the water to fish, so they still belong to the "literary" school after all.</p>
<p>However, the "moon in the water" will not be easily let go once it reaches the hands of non-literati or appears in front of non-literati. They always have to automatically or passively use their simple and ridiculous brains to think of unconventional methods, that is, to strip naked or even peel off their skin and draw out their tendons, they are also willing to go into the water to fish. But what is the result? How much and what do they catch after all? In addition to illusion, emptiness, curses, depression, and nakedness, exposure, peeling, tendon drawing, etc., will there be any other slightly practical significance?</p>
<p>In all the markets today, there are many clever gentlemen who are used to teasing people and taking advantage of them, and they secretly hang up a mirror-like thing that dazzles people's eyes or stimulates people's hearts, and emits a fierce and terrifying strong light, which shines on the rivers and seas, so that the rivers and seas also reflect a faint and empty shadow that is similar to having a child. A group of dull-headed fools and idiots will throw away their existing clothes and socks, endure the pain of skin and tendons, and jump into the sea to fish. When the fools and idiots are groping in the water, the always bright gentlemen who are playing tricks on the shore in the dark will collect their Dharma, roll up the clothes and socks of the fools and idiots, and take their skins and tendons to their own warm rooms, laughing and having fun! At this time, some of the fools in the sea realized that this was an unpredictable illusion and emptiness, so they resolutely climbed ashore, naked and covered with scars, and went home to make clothes, socks, rest, and heal injuries; some still lay in the water, cultivating their energy and waiting, waiting for the next time the moon appears so that they can fish again, even if they fish themselves to annihilation, they will not give up, he said: "I will fish for this moon even if I become a ghost."</p>
<p>Some people say: The fool is willing to give up everything and go into the sea to fish for this unpredictable, illusory, and empty moon, which shows his foolishness, dullness, stupidity, and abnormality 丨 But he still has consciousness, when he looks at the moon in the sea, accidentally, he will definitely look up and see the real moon in the sky. At this time, it is only because the moon in the sky is too far away from him, and it is too laborious and difficult to obtain, and the moon on the sea in front of him, he does not know is false, he thinks it seems that he can get it easily without much effort, so he abandons the far and takes the near, avoiding the heavy and doing dull things, resulting in the destruction of the whole self 丨 Therefore, their motives are still laziness, greed, and rascality! ……</p>
<p>Yes, but. We are essential, and we always have to actually obtain it. However, to actually obtain it, it is necessary to smash all the mirrors and magic weapons that create unpredictable, illusory, and empty fake moons, as well as all kinds of smoke screens. We will use the courage and determination to jump into the sea to obtain the real moon in the sky that is farther away from us, and must go through effort and difficulty before we can get it!</p>
<p>If you really want the moon, go to the sky to get it 丨</p>
<h3>Servant</h3>
<p>— Ryoka</p>
<p>Among human beings today, the most pitiful are servants, and the most hateful are also servants. This is caused by their special environment. It seems that it should not be harsh to blame them themselves. Here I just want to make a review of their special environment.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that two groups of five out of ten servants are proletarians. In this way, in the basis of human life, they can only be ranked on the dangerous minimum front. In fact, many simple people are living an extremely low life, as if they are similar to beggars patrolling along the door, and spiritually and in their souls, they must be tightened a lot.</p>
<p>However, after all, it is not like this. They have a lot of opportunities to connect with the rich, and they are a group with a lot of hope and vitality. This does not require historical research. Just flip through the stories. In the past 100 years, successful people who are "worthy of being passed down" are often used as teaching materials for the "civics" class in schools, and there are often amazing examples of such servants. For example: "So-and-so was born in poverty, and when he was thirty years old, he began to follow a wealthy Westerner to serve as a messenger. He was valued by his master for his loyalty and diligence. Later, his credit increased day by day, and his status became higher and higher. He stood on his own and his reputation suddenly rose. He was one of the great men of the time."</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the ability of servants to connect with the rich, to have hope, and to have vitality, all depends on loyalty and diligence. Loyalty and diligence are the only elixir for servants to rise high, so logically, all loyal and diligent servants have hope and vitality. Taking the facts before us as an example, loyal and diligent servants all gain the favor of their masters. As long as this is the case, the master will not hide any tricks or secrets from you, and some things even require you to come forward. When going out, in addition to taking a large male dog to protect them, it is also necessary for two or three servants to stand in front to boost their courage.</p>
<p>So, even more, from the current appearance of servants, their material enjoyment must also be very lively. Needless to say, ordinary errand girls, etc., wear, eat, and drink, most of them are somewhat like young wives and young masters, and their bodies are white and plump. The best is that the maids are holding little angels and driving a car alone on the road. We often encounter them. Of course, there are also quite a few who follow wealthy people and dignitaries to sit in flower cars to add color to the "comings and goings of crowns and canopies" in Beijing and Shanghai. Therefore, their comfortable life can be imagined.</p>
<p>The life of a servant is so lively and so guaranteed! It is because they are connected to wealthy people and dignitaries.</p>
<p>What is more, in addition to the importance of the master and the enjoyment bestowed by the master, there are often unexpected importance and rewards. For example, the young lady secretly communicates with wild men, and even secretly goes out on dates, which is very beneficial to the maids and the like. As long as they are loyal and reliable, the young lady is very trusting, and many major events will be sent to you, such as secretly delivering love letters and lightly getting up in the middle of the night to open the back door. In this way, the young lady will also take special care of you. In addition to putting on a good face and good feelings in front of you, in addition to giving you a lot of half-new and old clothes and stockings, in addition to having a small account for you, she will also speak on behalf of you in front of her mother and father to increase your salary. Similarly, the young master and the errand driver also have so many connections, such as being lazy in school and needing the maids to help them and massage their shoulders, and the rewards are not light.</p>
<p>Under these various circumstances, these servants are very arrogant to a group of people, and even act like a tiger and act as an accomplice. Therefore, many people now say that the world is too unlike what it should be and must be reformed. The servants do not think so much, which is precisely because they have the various relationships mentioned above, and they are tightly clinging to the "anesthetic." Therefore, they are not only very unbelieving, but also can give birth to powerful reactions, baring their teeth and claws, which is extremely fierce. When they once "prosper", their efforts to oppress and exploit those below will be deeper and more severe. Servants have lost some souls and awareness.</p>
<p>Therefore, in mankind, the most pitiful are servants, and the most hateful are also servants.</p>

<h3>Women</h3>
<p>— Jing Jia</p>
<p>"I need a woman." Ping told me in his letter: "I'm too lonely, I'm lonely like"</p>
<p>"Like a stone statue in the desert. No one to comfort me, to make me happy. I need a woman! Without a woman, emptiness will swallow me."</p>
<p>After reading the letter, I found it quite funny. I remembered his lanky figure, disheveled hair, flat nose, wide mouth, and that face covered in freckles.</p>
<p>Ping is a clerk at XX Company. The company isn't far from my house. I made a phone call to him, and I said: "I hope you can come to my house to talk."</p>
<p>That night, heavy raindrops beat on the ground. It was early summer weather. Very stuffy. Even such heavy rain couldn't wash away the sultriness.</p>
<p>I sat alone, reading Mao Dun's works. I heard the door open. Looking up, I saw a drenched chicken, which was the pitiful Ping.</p>
<p>"You need a woman?" I asked bluntly.</p>
<p>"What? Shouldn't I have one?"</p>
<p>"You should indeed!" I said, "You're grown up, and you have a job. Unlike me, who spends my life grinding away in books and classrooms."</p>
<p>"I think I should have one!" Ping lit a cigarette. "You really don't know how lonely I am!"</p>
<p>After a moment of silence, Ping said, "When I see those couples walking down the street with their arms around each other, I hate it: no, it's not hate, it's jealousy, I can assure you. I blush and sweat when I see women. But this time I should muster some courage!"</p>
<p>"I believe you already have someone in mind."</p>
<p>"No," he said, "I don't."</p>
<p>"You're not honest, your eyes have already told me!"</p>
<p>"Really? You really are a keen observer!" Ping blew smoke in my face. "Ha, I really do have someone!"</p>
<p>"Is that so!" I said, suppressing a smile, "You're so lucky in love! Can you tell me more details?"</p>
<p>"She's my classmate!" Ping said.</p>
<p>"Have you been to the movies together?"</p>
<p>"Go to the movies! How relaxed! We haven't even started writing our names in the register yet!"</p>
<p>"Doesn't she love you?"</p>
<p>"I don't know, I only know that I love her!"</p>
<p>"Haha!" I laughed, "What a ridiculous thing!"</p>
<p>"What? Can't I love her?" Ping was a bit angry!</p>
<p>"Not at all! Don't misunderstand. What do you want to do?" He scratched his head and threw the cigarette butt into the spittoon. "I must launch an attack. She really is breathtakingly beautiful! I think about her every moment."</p>
<p>So I asked, "How do you want to attack?"</p>
<p>He lit his second cigarette, paused for a moment, and said, "I want to write a letter, do you think that's a good idea?"</p>
<p>"Of course!" I said, "Writing a letter is a good idea, but it's hard to write one that's touching."</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter, I'll do my best to write it."</p>
<p>"I wish you victory!"</p>
<p>Ping didn't reply, he lay back in the chair, tilted his head back, and rings of blue smoke puffed out of his mouth, disappearing little by little!</p>
<p>I moved my chair, I stroked his disheveled hair with my hand: "You should first put some oil in your hair, and you should also apply some powder to your face."</p>
<p>Ping smiled and said, "That's true."</p>
<p>So I said teasingly, "Is it possible to tell me the lady's name?"</p>
<p>"I can't!"</p>
<p>"You'll have to tell me eventually anyway." I said, "Isn't it the same now?"</p>
<p>"Her surname is Yin." Ping said.</p>
<p>"Surname Yin?" I exclaimed in surprise. "What's her given name?"</p>
<p>"Lixia."</p>
<p>"Yin Lixia, Yin Lixia! Haha!" I laughed wildly!</p>
<p>"Hey, what's so funny!"</p>
<p>"Ha!" I tried my best to suppress my laughter. "That really is a beautiful name!"</p>
<p>"This is really a ridiculous thing!" I thought.</p>
<p>After a while, Ping got up to leave, and before leaving, he also firmly said: "Tonight, I must begin my work."</p>
<p>After Ping left, I lay in bed and thought quietly for half an hour. So I decided to proceed with my plan.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>A week later, Ping wrote to report his progress: "I've already received her reply. She has literary talent. It really is a touching love letter! I almost suspect I'm dreaming."</p>
<p>I wrote a line of words on red paper for him, I said: "Congratulations on your victory, reserve a banquet seat in advance."</p>
<p>Three days later, Ping made a phone call to me, he said: "Tomorrow we're going to XX Grand Theater."</p>
<p>"Her?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Of course, she's going too."</p>
<p>"What about me?"</p>
<p>"No admittance."</p>
<p>"That won't do."</p>
<p>"It's inconvenient."</p>
<p>"I don't care."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, don't make trouble."</p>
<p>"Can you stop me from watching the play?"</p>
<p>"Fine, go yourself. I don't care."</p>
<p>The phone hung up, and I laughed so hard I almost fell over.</p>
<p>The next afternoon. I arrived at XX Grand Theater. It was already quite late, the downstairs was already full! I went upstairs, and in the corner on the right I spotted Ping. I saw him wearing a very stiff suit, his hair also slicked with oil, and the freckles on his face were also partially concealed by snow powder and the like. From the time I met him until now, it was the first time I had seen him so neat.</p>
<p>When he saw me, he was very awkward. He greeted me.</p>
<p>I walked to the row where he was sitting. The lady Ping admired, who was sitting next to him, stood up and nodded to me, she said: "You're just arriving!"</p>
<p>I said with a smile: "I thought it was still too early!"</p>
<p>Ping said in surprise: "Do you know Ms. Yin?"</p>
<p>I gently sat down on the empty seat next to him, I gently stroked Ping's hair, I looked at the floorboards, I said softly: "She is my fiancée."</p>
